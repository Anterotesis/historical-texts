<P>_AS all the perceptions of the mind may be divided into <HI>impre&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>ideas,</HI> &s;o the impre&s;&s;ions admit of another divi&s;ion into <HI>original</HI> and <HI>&s;e|condary.</HI> This divi&s;ion of the impre&s;&s;ions is
<PB N="2" REF="7">
the &s;ame with that which <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book I. Part I. Sect. 2.</NOTE> I formerly made u&s;e of when I di&s;tingui&s;h'd them into im|pre&s;&s;ions of <HI>&s;en&s;ation</HI> and <HI>reflection.</HI> Origi|nal impre&s;&s;ions or impre&s;&s;ions of &s;en&s;ation are &s;uch as without any antecedent percep|tion ari&s;e in the &s;oul, from the con&s;titution of the body, from the animal &s;pirits, or from the application of objects to the ex|ternal organs. Secondary, or reflective im|pre&s;&s;ions are &s;uch as proceed from &s;ome of the&s;e original ones, either immediately or by the interpo&s;ition of its idea. Of the fir&s;t kind are all the impre&s;&s;ions of the &s;en&s;es, and all bodily pains and plea&s;ures: Of the &s;econd are the pa&s;&s;ions, and other emotions re&s;embling them.</P>
<P>'TIS certain, that the mind, in its per|ceptions, mu&s;t begin &s;omewhere; and that &s;ince the impre&s;&s;ions precede their corre|&s;pondent ideas, there mu&s;t be &s;ome impre&s;|&s;ions, which without any introduction make their appearance in the &s;oul. As the&s;e de|pend upon natural and phy&s;ical cau&s;es, the examination of them wou'd lead me too far from my pre&s;ent &s;ubject, into the &s;ci|ences of anatomy and natural philo&s;ophy. For this rea&s;on I &s;hall here confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e other impre&s;&s;ions, which I have
<PB N="3" REF="8">
call'd &s;econdary and reflective, as ari&s;ing either from the original impre&s;&s;ions, or from their ideas. Bodily pains and plea&s;ures are the &s;ource of many pa&s;&s;ions, both when felt and con&s;ider'd by the mind; but ari&s;e ori|ginally in the &s;oul, or in the body, which|ever you plea&s;e to call it, without any pre|ceding thought or perception. A fit of the gout produces a long train of pa&s;&s;ions, as grief, hope, fear; but is not deriv'd imme|diately from any affection or idea.</P>
<P>THE reflective impre&s;&s;ions may be di|vided into two kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>calm</HI> and the <HI>violent.</HI> Of the fir&s;t kind is the &s;en&s;e of beauty and deformity in action, compo&s;ition, and external objects. Of the &s;econd are the pa&s;&s;ions of love and hatred, grief and joy, pride and humility. This divi&s;ion is far from being exact. The raptures of poetry and mu&s;ic frequently ri&s;e to the greate&s;t height; while tho&s;e other impre&s;&s;ions, pro|perly call'd <HI>pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> may decay into &s;o &s;oft an emotion, as to become, in a manner, imperceptible. But as in general the pa&s;|&s;ions are more violent than the emotions ari&s;ing from beauty and deformity, the&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions have been commonly di&s;tingui&s;h'd from each other. The &s;ubject of the hu|man mind being &s;o copious and various,
<PB N="4" REF="9">
I &s;hall here take advantage of this vulgar and &s;pecious divi&s;ion, that I may proceed with the greater order; and having &s;aid all I thought nece&s;&s;ary concerning our ideas, &s;hall now explain tho&s;e violent emotions or pa&s;&s;ions, their nature, origin, cau&s;es, and effects.</P>
<P>WHEN we take a &s;urvey of the pa&s;&s;ions, there occurs a divi&s;ion of them into <HI>direct</HI> and <HI>indirect.</HI> By direct pa&s;&s;ions I under|&s;tand &s;uch as ari&s;e immediately from good or evil, from pain or plea&s;ure. By indirect &s;uch as proceed from the &s;ame principles, but by the conjunction of other qualities. This di&s;tinction I cannot at pre&s;ent ju&s;tify or explain any farther. I can only ob&s;erve in general, that under the indirect pa&s;&s;ions I comprehend pride, humility, ambition, vanity, love, hatred, envy, pity, malice, ge|nero&s;ity, with their dependants. And under the direct pa&s;&s;ions, de&s;ire, aver&s;ion, grief, joy, hope, fear, de&s;pair and &s;ecurity. I &s;hall begin with the former.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. <HI>Of pride and humility; their objects and cau&s;es.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ions of PRIDE and HUMI|LITY being &s;imple and uniform impre&s;&s;ions, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible we can ever, by a multitude of words, give a ju&s;t definition of them, or indeed of any of the pa&s;&s;ions. The utmo&s;t we can pretend to is a de&s;crip|tion of them, by an enumeration of &s;uch circum&s;tances, as attend them: But as the&s;e words, <HI>pride</HI> and <HI>humility,</HI> are of general u&s;e, and the impre&s;&s;ions they repre&s;ent the mo&s;t common of any, every one, of him&s;elf, will be able to form a ju&s;t idea of them, with|out any danger of mi&s;take. For which rea|&s;on, not to lo&s;e time upon preliminaries, I &s;hall immediately enter upon the examina|tion of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that pride and humility, tho' directly contrary, have yet the &s;ame OBJECT. This object is &s;elf, or that &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of related ideas and impre&s;&s;ions, of which we have an intimate memory and con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. Here the view always fixes when
<PB N="6" REF="11">
we are actuated by either of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. According as our idea of our&s;elf is more or le&s;s advantageous, we feel either of tho&s;e op|po&s;ite affections, and are elated by pride, or dejected with humility. Whatever other objects may be comprehended by the mind, they are always con&s;ider'd with a view to our&s;elves; otherwi&s;e they wou'd never be able either to excite the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, or pro|duce the &s;malle&s;t encrea&s;e or diminution of them. When &s;elf enters not into the con|fideration, there is no room either for pride or humility.</P>
<P>BUT tho' that connected &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of perceptions, which we call <HI>&s;elf,</HI> be always the object of the&s;e two pa&s;&s;ions, 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible it can be their CAUSE, or be &s;ufficient alone to excite them. For as the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are directly contrary, and have the &s;ame object in common; were their object al&s;o their cau&s;e; it cou'd never produce any de|gree of the one pa&s;&s;ion, but at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t excite an equal degree of the other; which oppo&s;ition and contrariety mu&s;t de|&s;troy both. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible a man can at the &s;ame time be both proud and humble; and where he has different rea&s;ons for the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, as frequently happens, the pa&s;&s;ions either take place alternately; or if they en|counter,
<PB N="7" REF="12">
the one annihilates the other, as far as its &s;trength goes, and the remainder only of that, which is &s;uperior, continues to ope|rate upon the mind. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e neither of the pa&s;&s;ions cou'd ever become &s;uperior; becau&s;e &s;uppo&s;ing it to be the view only of our&s;elf, which excited them, that being perfectly indifferent to either, mu&s;t produce both in the very &s;ame proportion; or in other words, can produce neither. To excite any pa&s;&s;ion, and at the &s;ame time rai&s;e an equal &s;hare of its antagoni&s;t, is im|mediately to undo what was done, and mu&s;t leave the mind at la&s;t perfectly calm and indifferent.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t, therefore, make a di&s;tinction betwixt the cau&s;e and the object of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions; betwixt that idea, which excites them, and that to which they direct their view, when excited. Pride and humility, being once rais'd, immediately turn our at|tention to our&s;elf, and regard that as their ultimate and final object; but there is &s;ome|thing farther requi&s;ite in order to rai&s;e them: Something, which is peculiar to one of the pa&s;&s;ions, and produces not both in the very &s;ame degree. The fir&s;t idea, that is pre|&s;ented to the mind, is that of the cau&s;e or productive principle. This excites the pa&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="8" REF="13">
connected with it; and that pa&s;&s;ion, when excited, turns our view to another idea, which is that of &s;elf. Here then is a pa&s;&s;ion plac'd betwixt two ideas, of which the one produces it, and the other is produc'd by it. The fir&s;t idea, therefore, repre&s;ents the <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> the &s;econd the <HI>object</HI> of the pa&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>TO begin with the cau&s;es of pride and humility; we may ob&s;erve, that their mo&s;t obvious and remarkable property is the va&s;t variety of <HI>&s;ubjects,</HI> on which they may be plac'd. Every valuable quality of the mind, whether of the imagination, judgment, me|mory or di&s;po&s;ition; wit, good-&s;en&s;e, learning, courage, ju&s;tice, integrity; all the&s;e are the cau&s;es of pride; and their oppo&s;ites of hu|mility. Nor are the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions confin'd to the mind, but extend their view to the body likewi&s;e. A man may be proud of his beauty, &s;trength, agility, good mein, addre&s;s in dancing, riding, fencing, and of his dexte|rity in any manual bu&s;ine&s;s or manufacture. But this is not all. The pa&s;&s;ion looking far|ther, comprehend whatever objects are in the lea&s;t ally'd or related to us. Our coun|try, family, children, relations, riches, hou&s;es, gardens, hor&s;es, dogs, cloaths; any of the&s;e may become a cau&s;e either of pride or of humility.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="14">
FROM the con&s;ideration of the&s;e cau&s;es, it appears nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hou'd make a new di&s;tinction in the cau&s;es of the pa&s;|&s;ion, betwixt that <HI>quality,</HI> which operates, and the <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> on which it is plac'd. A man, for in&s;tance, is vain of a beautiful hou&s;e, which belongs to him, or which he has him&s;elf built and contriv'd. Here the object of the pa&s;&s;ion is him&s;elf, and the cau&s;e is the beautiful hou&s;e: Which cau&s;e again is &s;ub-divided into two parts, <HI>viz.</HI> the quality, which operates upon the pa&s;&s;ion, and the &s;ubject, in which the quality in|heres. The quality is the beauty, and the &s;ubject is the hou&s;e, con&s;ider'd as his property or contrivance. Both the&s;e parts are e&s;&s;ential, nor is the di&s;tinction vain and chimerical. Beauty, con&s;ider'd merely as &s;uch, unle&s;s plac'd upon &s;omething related to us, never produces any pride or vanity; and the &s;tronge&s;t relation alone, without beauty, or &s;omething el&s;e in its place, has as little influence on that pa&s;&s;ion. Since, therefore, the&s;e two particulars are ea&s;ily &s;e|parated, and there is a nece&s;&s;ity for their conjunction, in order to produce the pa&s;|&s;ion, we ought to con&s;ider them as com|ponent parts of the cau&s;e; and infix in our minds an exact idea of this di&s;tinction.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<PB N="10" REF="15">
<HEAD>SECT. III. <HI>Whence the&s;e objects and cau&s;es are deriv'd.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEING &s;o far advanc'd as to ob&s;erve a difference betwixt the <HI>object</HI> of the pa&s;&s;ions and their <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> and to di&s;tingui&s;h in the cau&s;e the <HI>quality,</HI> which operates on the pa&s;&s;ions, from the <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> in which it inheres; we now proceed to examine what determines each of them to be what it is, and a&s;&s;igns &s;uch a particular object, and quality, and &s;ubject to the&s;e affections. By this means we &s;hall fully under&s;tand the origin of pride and humility.</P>
<P>'TIS evident in the fir&s;t place, that the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are determin'd to have &s;elf for their <HI>ob|ject,</HI> not only by a natural but al&s;o by an original property. No one can doubt but this property is <HI>natural</HI> from the con&s;tancy and &s;teadine&s;s of its operations. 'Tis always &s;elf, which is the object of pride and hu|mility; and whenever the pa&s;&s;ions look be|yond, 'tis &s;till with a view to our&s;elves, nor can any per&s;on or object otherwi&s;e have any influence upon us.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="16">
THAT this proceeds from an <HI>original</HI> quality or primary impul&s;e, will likewi&s;e ap|pear evident, if we con&s;ider that 'tis the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. Unle&s;s nature had given &s;ome original qua|lities to the mind, it cou'd never have any &s;econdary ones; becau&s;e in that ca&s;e it wou'd have no foundation for action, nor cou'd ever begin to exert it&s;elf. Now the&s;e qua|lities, which we mu&s;t con&s;ider as original, are &s;uch as are mo&s;t in&s;eparable from the &s;oul, and can be re&s;olv'd into no other: And &s;uch is the quality, which determines the object of pride and humility.</P>
<P>WE may, perhaps, make it a greater que&s;tion, whether the <HI>cau&s;es,</HI> that produce the pa&s;&s;ion, be as <HI>natural</HI> as the object, to which it is directed, and whether all that va&s;t variety proceeds from caprice or from the con&s;titution of the mind. This doubt we &s;hall &s;oon remove, if we ca&s;t our eye upon human nature, and con&s;ider that in all nations and ages, the &s;ame objects &s;till give ri&s;e to pride and humility; and that upon the view even of a &s;tranger, we can know pretty nearly, what will either encrea&s;e or dimi|ni&s;h his pa&s;&s;ions of this kind. If there be any variation in this particular, it pro|ceeds from nothing but a difference in the
<PB N="12" REF="17">
tempers and complexions of men; and is be&s;ides very incon&s;iderable. Can we ima|gine it po&s;&s;ible, that while human nature remains the &s;ame, men will ever become entirely indifferent to their power, riches, beauty or per&s;onal merit, and that their pride and vanity will not be affected by the&s;e advantages?</P>
<P>BUT tho' the cau&s;es of pride and humi|lity be plainly <HI>natural,</HI> we &s;hall find upon examination, that they are not <HI>original,</HI> and that 'tis utterly impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hou'd each of them be adapted to the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions by a particular provi&s;ion, and primary con|&s;titution of nature. Be&s;ide their prodigious number, many of them are the effects of art, and ari&s;e partly from the indu&s;try, partly from the caprice, and partly from the good fortune of men. Indu&s;try produces hou&s;es, furniture, cloaths. Caprice deter|mines their particular kinds and qualities. And good fortune frequently contributes to all this, by di&s;covering the effects that re|&s;ult from the different mixtures and com|binations of bodies. 'Tis ab&s;urd, therefore, to imagine, that each of the&s;e was fore&s;een and provided for by nature, and that every new production of art, which cau&s;es pride or humility; in&s;tead of adapting it&s;elf to
<PB N="13" REF="18">
the pa&s;&s;ion by partaking of &s;ome general quality, that naturally operates on the mind; is it&s;elf the object of an original principle, which till then lay conceal'd in the &s;oul, and is only by accident at la&s;t brought to light. Thus the fir&s;t mechanic, that in|vented a fine &s;critoure, produc'd pride in him, who became po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, by principles dif|ferent from tho&s;e, which made him proud of hand&s;ome chairs and tables. As this ap|pears evidently ridiculous, we mu&s;t conclude, that each cau&s;e of pride and humility is not adapted to the pa&s;&s;ions by a di&s;tinct ori|ginal quality; but that there are &s;ome one or more circum&s;tances common to all of them, on which their efficacy depends.</P>
<P>BESIDES, we find in the cour&s;e of nature, that tho' the effects be many, the princi|ples, from which they ari&s;e, are commonly but few and &s;imple, and that 'tis the &s;ign of an un&s;kilful naturali&s;t to have recour&s;e to a different quality, in order to explain every different operation. How much more mu&s;t this be true with regard to the hu|man mind, which being &s;o confin'd a &s;ub|ject may ju&s;tly be thought incapable of con|taining &s;uch a mon&s;trous heap of principles, as wou'd be nece&s;&s;ary to excite the pa&s;&s;ions of pride and humility, were each di&s;tinct
<PB N="14" REF="19">
cau&s;e adapted to the pa&s;&s;ion by a di&s;tinct &s;et of principles?</P>
<P>HERE, therefore, moral philo&s;ophy is in the &s;ame condition as natural, with re|gard to a&s;tronomy before the time of <HI>Co|pernicus.</HI> The antients, tho' &s;en&s;ible of that maxim, <HI>that nature does nothing in vain,</HI> contriv'd &s;uch intricate &s;y&s;tems of the hea|vens, as &s;eem'd incon&s;i&s;tent with true phi|lo&s;ophy, and gave place at la&s;t to &s;omething more &s;imple and natural. To invent with|out &s;cruple a new principle to every new phaenomenon, in&s;tead of adapting it to the old; to overload our hypothe&s;es with a va|riety of this kind; are certain proofs; that none of the&s;e principles is the ju&s;t one, and that we only de&s;ire, by a number of fal&s;e|hoods, to cover our ignorance of the truth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IV. <HI>Of the relations of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THUS we have e&s;tabli&s;h'd two truths without any ob&s;tacle or difficulty, <HI>that 'tis from natural principles this va|riety of cau&s;es excite pride and humility,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="20">
and <HI>that 'tis not by a different principle each different cau&s;e is adapted to its pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> We &s;hall now proceed to enquire how we may reduce the&s;e principles to a le&s;&s;er number, and find among the cau&s;es &s;omething common, on which their influence depends.</P>
<P>IN order to this we mu&s;t reflect on cer|tain properties of human nature, which tho' they have a mighty influence on every ope|ration both of the under&s;tanding and pa&s;|&s;ions, are not commonly much in&s;i&s;ted on by philo&s;ophers. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e is the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, which I have &s;o often ob&s;erv'd and explain'd. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for the mind to fix it&s;elf &s;teadily upon one idea for any con&s;iderable time; nor can it by its utmo&s;t efforts ever arrive at &s;uch a con&s;tan|cy. But however changeable our thoughts may be, they are not entirely without rule and method in their changes. The rule, by which they proceed, is to pa&s;s from one object to what is re&s;embling, contiguous to, or produc'd by it. When one idea is pre|&s;ent to the imagination, any other, united by the&s;e relations, naturally follows it, and enters with more facility by means of that introduction.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> property I &s;hall ob&s;erve in the human mind is a like a&s;&s;ociation of im|pre&s;&s;ions.

All re&s;embling impre&s;&s;ions are connected together, and no &s;ooner one ari&s;es than the re&s;t immediately follow. Grief and di&s;appointment give ri&s;e to anger, an|ger to envy, envy to malice, and malice to grief again, till the whole circle be com|pleated. In like manner our temper, when elevated with joy, naturally throws it&s;elf into love, genero&s;ity, pity, courage, pride, and the other re&s;embling affections. 'Tis difficult for the mind, when actuated by any pa&s;&s;ion, to confine it&s;elf to that pa&s;&s;ion alone, without any change or variation. Hu|man nature is too incon&s;tant to admit of any &s;uch regularity. Changeablene&s;s is e&s;|&s;ential to it. And to what can it &s;o natu|rally change as to affections or emotions, which are &s;uitable to the temper, and agree with that &s;et of pa&s;&s;ions, which then prevail? 'Tis evident, then, there is an attraction or a&s;&s;ociation among impre&s;&s;ions, as well as among ideas; tho' with this re|markable difference, that ideas are a&s;&s;ociated by re&s;emblance, contiguity, and cau&s;ation; and impre&s;&s;ions only by re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>third</HI> place, 'tis ob&s;ervable of the&s;e two kinds of a&s;&s;ociation, that they very much a&s;&s;i&s;t and forward each other, and that the tran&s;ition is more ea&s;ily made where
<PB N="17" REF="22">
they both concur in the &s;ame object. Thus a man, who, by any injury from another, is very much di&s;compos'd and ruffled in his temper, is apt to find a hundred &s;ubjects of di&s;content, impatience, fear, and other unea&s;y pa&s;&s;ions; e&s;pecially if he can di&s;|cover the&s;e &s;ubjects in or near the per&s;on, who was the cau&s;e of his fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion. Tho&s;e principles, which forward the tran&s;ition of ideas, here concur with tho&s;e, which ope|rate on the pa&s;&s;ions; and both uniting in one action, be&s;tow on the mind a double impul&s;e. The new pa&s;&s;ion, therefore, mu&s;t ari&s;e with &s;o much greater violence, and the tran&s;ition to it mu&s;t be render'd &s;o much more ea&s;y and natural.</P>
<P>UPON this occa&s;ion I may cite the au|thority of an elegant writer, who expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the following manner. <Q>As the fancy delights in every thing that is great, &s;trange, or beautiful, and is &s;till more pleas'd the more it finds of the&s;e perfections in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> object, &s;o it is ca|pable of receiving a new &s;atisfaction by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of another &s;en&s;e. Thus any continu'd &s;ound, as the mu&s;ic of birds, or a fall of waters, awakens every mo|ment the mind of the beholder, and makes him more attentive to the &s;everal
<PB N="18" REF="23">
beauties of the place, that lie before him. Thus if there ari&s;es a fragrancy of &s;mells or perfumes, they heighten the plea&s;ure of the imagination, and make even the colours and verdure of the land|&s;chape appear more agreeable; for the ideas of both &s;en&s;es recommend each other, and are plea&s;anter together than when they enter the mind &s;eparately: As the different colours of a picture, when they are well di&s;po&s;ed, &s;et off one anotehr, and receive an additional beauty from the advantage of the &s;ituation.</Q> In this phae|nomenon we may remark the a&s;&s;ociation both of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, as well as the mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance they lend each other.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. <HI>Of the influence of the&s;e relations on pride and humility.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THESE principles being e&s;tabli&s;h'd on unque&s;tionable experience, I be|gin to con&s;ider how we &s;hall apply them, by revolving over all the cau&s;es of pride and humility, whether the&s;e cau&s;es be regarded, as the qualities, that operate, or as the &s;ub|jects, on which the qualities are plac'd. In
<PB N="19" REF="24">
examining the&s;e <HI>qualities</HI> I immediately find many of them to concur in producing the &s;en&s;ation of pain and plea&s;ure, indepen|dent of tho&s;e affections, which I here endea|vour to explain. Thus the beauty of our per&s;on, of it&s;elf, and by its very appear|ance, gives plea&s;ure, as well as pride; and its deformity, pain as well as humility. A magnificent fea&s;t delights us, and a &s;ordid one di&s;plea&s;es. What I di&s;cover to be true in &s;ome in&s;tances, I <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> to be &s;o in all; and take it for granted at pre&s;ent, with|out any farther proof, that every cau&s;e of pride, by its peculiar qualities, produces a &s;eparate plea&s;ure, and of humility a &s;eparate unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>AGAIN, in con&s;idering the <HI>&s;ubjects,</HI> to which the&s;e qualities adhere, I make a new <HI>&s;uppo&s;ition,</HI> which al&s;o appears probable from many obvious in&s;tances, <HI>viz.</HI> that the&s;e &s;ub|jects are either parts of our&s;elves, or &s;ome|thing nearly related to us. Thus the good and bad qualities of our actions and manners con&s;titute virtue and vice, and determine our per&s;onal character, than which nothing operates more &s;trongly on the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions. In like manner, 'tis the beauty or de|formity of our per&s;on, hou&s;es, equipage, or furniture, by which we are render'd either
<PB N="20" REF="25">
vain or humble. The &s;ame qualities, when transfer'd to &s;ubjects, which bear us no re|lation, influence not in the &s;malle&s;t degree either of the&s;e affections.</P>
<P>HAVING thus in a manner &s;uppos'd two properties of the cau&s;es of the&s;e affections, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>qualities</HI> produce a &s;eparate pain or plea&s;ure, and that the <HI>&s;ubjects,</HI> on which the qualities are plac'd, are related to &s;elf; I proceed to examine the pa&s;&s;ions them&s;elves, in order to find &s;ome|thing in them, corre&s;pondent to the &s;uppos'd properties of their cau&s;es. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I find, that the peculiar object of pride and humility is determin'd by an original and natural in&s;tinct, and that 'tis ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, from the primary con&s;titution of the mind, that the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions &s;hou'd ever look beyond &s;elf, or that individual per&s;on, of who&s;e actions and &s;entiments each of us is intimately con|&s;cious. Here at la&s;t the view always re&s;ts, when we are actuated by either of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions; nor can we, in that &s;ituation of mind, ever lo&s;e &s;ight of this object. For this I pretend not to give any rea&s;on; but con&s;ider &s;uch a peculiar direction of the thought as an original quality.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> quality, which I di&s;cover in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, and which I likewi&s;e con&s;ider as
<PB N="21" REF="26">
an original quality, is their &s;en&s;ations, or the peculiar emotions they excite in the &s;oul, and which con&s;titute their very being and e&s;&s;ence. Thus pride is a plea&s;ant &s;en|&s;ation, and humility a painful; and upon the removal of the plea&s;ure and pain, there is in reality no pride nor humility. Of this our very feeling convinces us; and beyond our feeling, 'tis here in vain to rea&s;on or di&s;pute.</P>
<P>IF I compare, therefore, the&s;e two <HI>e|&s;tabli&s;h'd</HI> properties of the pa&s;&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> their object, which is &s;elf, and their &s;en&s;a|tion, which is either plea&s;ant or painful, to the two <HI>&s;uppos'd</HI> properties of the cau&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> their relation to &s;elf, and their tendency to produce a pain or plea&s;ure, independent of the pa&s;&s;ion; I immediately find, that taking the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions to be ju&s;t, the true &s;y&s;tem breaks in upon me with an irre&s;i&s;tible evi|dence. That cau&s;e, which excites the pa&s;|&s;ion, is related to the object, which nature has attributed to the pa&s;&s;ion; the &s;en&s;ation, which the cau&s;e &s;eparately produces, is related to the &s;en&s;ation of the pa&s;&s;ion: From this double relation of ideas and im|pre&s;&s;ions, the pa&s;&s;ion is deriv'd. The one idea is ea&s;ily converted into its cor-relative; and the one impre&s;&s;ion into that, which re|&s;embles
<PB N="22" REF="27">
and corre&s;ponds to it: With how much greater facility mu&s;t this tran&s;ition be made, where the&s;e movements mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, and the mind receives a double im|pul&s;e from the relations both of its impre&s;|&s;ions and ideas?</P>
<P>THAT we may comprehend this the bet|ter, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that nature has given to the organs of the human mind, a certain di&s;po&s;ition fitted to produce a peculiar im|pre&s;&s;ion or emotion, which we call <HI>pride:</HI> To this emotion &s;he has a&s;&s;ign'd a certain idea, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>&s;elf,</HI> which it never fails to produce. This contrivance of nature is ea&s;ily conceiv'd. We have many in&s;tances of &s;uch a &s;ituation of affairs. The nerves of the no&s;e and palate are &s;o di&s;pos'd, as in certain circum&s;tances to convey &s;uch pecu|liar &s;en&s;ations to the mind: The &s;en&s;ations of lu&s;t and hunger always produce in us the idea of tho&s;e peculiar objects, which are &s;uitable to each appetite. The&s;e two cir|cum&s;tances are united in pride. The or|gans are &s;o di&s;pos'd as to produce the pa&s;|&s;ion; and the pa&s;&s;ion, after its production, naturally produces a certain idea. All this needs no proof. 'Tis evident we never &s;hou'd be po&s;&s;e&s;t of that pa&s;&s;ion, were there not a di&s;po&s;ition of mind proper for it; and 'tis
<PB N="23" REF="28">
as evident, that the pa&s;&s;ion always turns our view to our&s;elves, and makes us think of our own qualities and circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THIS being fully comprehended, it may now be a&s;k'd, <HI>Whether nature produces the pa&s;&s;ion immediately, of her&s;elf; or whether &s;he mu&s;t be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the co-operation of other cau&s;es?</HI> For 'tis ob&s;ervable, that in this par|ticular her conduct is different in the dif|ferent pa&s;&s;ions and &s;en&s;ations. The palate mu&s;t be excited by an external object, in order to produce any reli&s;h: But hunger a|ri&s;es internally, without the concurrence of any external object. But however the ca&s;e may &s;tand with other pa&s;&s;ions and impre&s;|&s;ions, 'tis certain, that pride requires the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome foreign object, and that the organs, which produce it, exert not them|&s;elves like the heart and arteries, by an ori|ginal internal movement. For <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> daily experience convinces us, that pride requires certain cau&s;es to excite it, and langui&s;hes when un&s;upported by &s;ome excellency in the cha|racter, in bodily accompli&s;hments, in cloaths, equipage or fortune. <HI>Secondly,</HI> 'tis evident pride wou'd be perpetual, if it aro&s;e im|mediately from nature; &s;ince the object is always the &s;ame, and there is no di&s;|po&s;ition of body peculiar to pride, as there
<PB N="24" REF="29">
is to thir&s;t and hunger. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Hu|mility is in the very &s;ame &s;ituation with pride; and therefore, either mu&s;t, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, be perpetual likewi&s;e, or mu&s;t de&s;troy the contrary pa&s;&s;ion from the very fir&s;t moment; &s;o that none of them cou'd ever make its appearance. Upon the whole, we may re&s;t &s;atisfy'd with the foregoing conclu&s;ion, that pride mu&s;t have a cau&s;e, as well as an object, and that the one has no influence without the other.</P>
<P>THE difficulty, then, is only to di&s;cover this cau&s;e, and find what it is that gives the fir&s;t motion to pride, and &s;ets tho&s;e organs in action, which are naturally fitted to pro|duce that emotion. Upon my con&s;ulting experience, in order to re&s;olve this difficulty, I immediately find a hundred different cau&s;es, that produce pride; and upon examining the&s;e cau&s;es, I &s;uppo&s;e, what at fir&s;t I perceive to be probable, that all of them concur in two circum&s;tances; which are, that of them&s;elves they produce an impre&s;&s;ion, ally'd to the pa&s;&s;ion, and are plac'd on a &s;ubject, ally'd to the object of the pa&s;&s;ion. When I con|&s;ider after this the nature of <HI>relation,</HI> and its effects both on the pa&s;&s;ions and ideas, I can no longer doubt, upon the&s;e &s;uppo&s;i|tions,
<PB N="25" REF="30">
that 'tis the very principle, which gives ri&s;e to pride, and be&s;tows motion on tho&s;e organs, which being naturally di&s;pos'd to produce that affection, require only a fir&s;t impul&s;e or beginning to their action. Any thing, that gives a plea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation, and is related to &s;elf, excites the pa&s;&s;ion of pride, which is al&s;o agreeable, and has &s;elf for its object.</P>
<P>WHAT I have &s;aid of pride is equally true of humility. The &s;en&s;ation of humi|lity is unea&s;y, as that of pride is agreeable; for which rea&s;on the &s;eparate &s;en&s;ation, a|ri&s;ing from the cau&s;es, mu&s;t be revers'd, while the relation to &s;elf continues the &s;ame. Tho' pride and humility are directly contrary in their effects, and in their &s;en&s;ations, they have notwith&s;tanding the &s;ame object; &s;o that 'tis requi&s;ite only to change the rela|tion of impre&s;&s;ions, without making any change upon that of ideas. Accordingly we find, that a beautiful hou&s;e, belonging to our&s;elves, produces pride; and that the &s;ame hou&s;e, &s;till belonging to our&s;elves, produces humility, when by any accident its beauty is chang'd into deformity, and thereby the &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure, which corre&s;ponded to pride, is transform'd into pain, which is re|lated to humility. The double relation be|tween
<PB N="26" REF="31">
the ideas and impre&s;&s;ions &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in both ca&s;es, and produces an ea&s;y tran&s;ition from the one emotion to the other.</P>
<P>IN a word, nature has be&s;tow'd a kind of attraction on certain impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, by which one of them, upon its appearance, naturally introduces its correlative. If the&s;e two attractions or a&s;&s;ociations of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas concur on the &s;ame object, they mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, and the tran&s;ition of the affections and of the imagination is made with the greate&s;t ea&s;e and facility. When an idea produces an impre&s;&s;ion, re|lated to an impre&s;&s;ion, which is connected with an idea, related to the fir&s;t idea, the&s;e two impre&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be in a manner in&s;epa|rable, nor will the one in any ca&s;e be un|attended with the other. 'Tis after this manner, that the particular cau&s;es of pride and humility are determin'd. The quality, which operates on the pa&s;&s;ion, produces &s;e|parately an impre&s;&s;ion re&s;embling it; the &s;ubject, to which the quality adheres, is re|lated to &s;elf, the object of the pa&s;&s;ion: No wonder the whole cau&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of a qua|lity and of a &s;ubject, does &s;o unavoidably give ri&s;e to the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>TO illu&s;trate this hypothe&s;is, we may com|pare it to that, by which I have already ex|plain'd
<PB N="27" REF="32">
the belief attending the judgments, which we form from cau&s;ation. I have ob|&s;erv'd, that in all judgments of this kind, there is always a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, and a related idea; and that the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion gives a vivacity to the fancy, and the relation conveys this vivacity, by an ea&s;y tran&s;ition, to the re|lated idea. Without the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, the attention is not fix'd, nor the &s;pirits ex|cited. Without the relation, this attention re&s;ts on its fir&s;t object, and has no farther con&s;equence. There is evidently a great ana|logy betwixt that hypothe&s;is, and our pre|&s;ent one of an impre&s;&s;ion and idea, that transfu&s;e them&s;elves into another impre&s;&s;ion and idea by means of their double relation: Which analogy mu&s;t be allow'd to be no de&s;picable proof of both hypothe&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. <HI>Limitations of this &s;y&s;tem.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUT before we proceed farther in this &s;ubject, and examine particularly all the cau&s;es of pride and humility, 'twill be proper to make &s;ome limitations to the ge|neral &s;y&s;tem, <HI>that all agreeable objects, re|lated to our&s;elves, by an a&s;&s;ociation of ideas</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="33">
<HI>and of impre&s;&s;ions, produce pride, and di&s;agree|able ones, humility:</HI> And the&s;e limitations are deriv'd from the very nature of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">I. SUPPOSE an agreeable object to acquire a relation to &s;elf, the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, that ap|pears on this occa&s;ion, is joy; and this pa&s;|&s;ion di&s;covers it&s;elf upon a &s;lighter relation than pride and vain-glory. We may feel joy upon being pre&s;ent at a fea&s;t, where our &s;en&s;es are regal'd with delicacies of every kind: But 'tis only the ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t, who, be&s;ide the &s;ame joy, has the additional pa&s;&s;ion of &s;elf-applau&s;e and vanity. 'Tis true, men &s;ometimes boa&s;t of a great enter|tainment, at which they have only been pre&s;ent; and by &s;o &s;mall a relation convert their plea&s;ure into pride: But however, this mu&s;t in general be own'd, that joy ari&s;es from a more incon&s;iderable relation than va|nity, and that many things, which are too foreign to produce pride, are yet able to give us a delight and plea&s;ure. The rea|&s;on of the difference may be explain'd thus. A relation is requi&s;ite to joy, in order to ap|proach the object to us, and make it give us any &s;atisfaction. But be&s;ide this, which is common to both pa&s;&s;ions, 'tis requi&s;ite to pride, in order to produce a tran&s;ition
<PB N="29" REF="34">
from one pa&s;&s;ion to another, and convert the &s;atisfaction into vanity. As it has a double ta&s;k to perform, it mu&s;t be endow'd with double force and energy. To which we may add, that where agreeable objects bear not a very clo&s;e relation to our&s;elves, they commonly do to &s;ome other per&s;on; and this latter relation not only excels; but even dimini&s;hes, and &s;ometimes de&s;troys the former, as we &s;hall &s;ee afterwards <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part II. Sect. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HERE then is the fir&s;t limitation, we mu&s;t make to our general po&s;ition, <HI>that every thing related to us, which produces plea&s;ure or pain, produces likewi&s;e pride or humility.</HI> There is not only a relation requir'd, but a clo&s;e one, and a clo&s;er than is requir'd to joy.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE &s;econd limitation is, that the agreeable or di&s;agreeable object be not only clo&s;ely related, but al&s;o peculiar to our&s;elves, or at lea&s;t common to us with a few per|&s;ons. 'Tis a quality ob&s;ervable in human nature, and which we &s;hall endeavour to ex|plain afterwards, that every thing, which is often pre&s;ented, and to which we have been long accu&s;tom'd, lo&s;es its value in our eyes, and is in a little time de&s;pis'd and neglected. We likewi&s;e judge of objects more from
<PB N="30" REF="35">
compari&s;on than from their real and intrin&s;ic merit; and where we cannot by &s;ome con|tra&s;t enhance their value, we are apt to over|look even what is e&s;&s;entially good in them. The&s;e qualities of the mind have an effect up|on joy as well as pride; and 'tis remarkable, that goods, which are common to all mankind, and have become familiar to us by cu&s;tom, give us little &s;atisfaction; tho' perhaps of a more excellent kind, than tho&s;e on which, for their &s;ingularity, we &s;et a much higher value. But tho' this circum&s;tance operates on both the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, it has a much greater influence on vanity. We are rejoic'd for many goods, which, on account of their frequency, give us on pride. Health, when it returns after a long ab&s;ence, affords us a very &s;en&s;ible &s;atisfac|tion; but is &s;eldom regarded as a &s;ubject of vanity, becau&s;e 'tis &s;har'd with &s;uch va&s;t numbers.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on, why pride is &s;o much more delicate in this particular than joy, I take to be, as follows. In order to excite pride, there are always two objects we mu&s;t con|template, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> or that object which produces plea&s;ure; and &s;elf, which is the real object of the pa&s;&s;ion. But joy has only one object nece&s;&s;ary to its production, <HI>viz.</HI> that which gives plea&s;ure; and tho' it be requi|&s;ite,
<PB N="31" REF="36">
that this bear &s;ome relation to &s;elf, yet that is only requi&s;ite in order to render it agreeable; nor is &s;elf, properly &s;peaking, the object of this pa&s;&s;ion. Since, therefore, pride has in a manner two objects, to which it directs our view; it follows, that where neither of them have any &s;ingularity, the pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be more weaken'd upon that account, than a pa&s;&s;ion, which has only one object. Upon comparing our&s;elves with o|thers, as we are every moment apt to do, we find we are not in the lea&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h'd; and upon comparing the object we po&s;&s;e&s;s, we di&s;cover &s;till the &s;ame unlucky circum|&s;tance. By two compari&s;ons &s;o di&s;advan|tageous the pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be entirely de|&s;troy'd.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE third limitation is, that the plea&s;ant or painful object be very di&s;cernible and obvious, and that not only to our&s;elves, but to others al&s;o. This circum&s;tance, like the two foregoing, has an effect upon joy, as well as pride. We fancy our&s;elves more happy, as well as more virtuous or beauti|ful, when we appear &s;o to others; but are &s;till more o&s;tentacious of our virtues than of our plea&s;ures. This proceeds from cau&s;es, which I &s;hall endeavour to explain after|wards.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="32" REF="37">
IV. THE fourth limitation is deriv'd from the incon&s;tancy of the cau&s;e of the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions, and from the &s;hort duration of its con|nexion with our&s;elves. What is ca&s;ual and incon&s;tant gives but little joy, and le&s;s pride. We are not much &s;atisfy'd with the thing it&s;elf; and are &s;till le&s;s apt to feel any new degrees of &s;elf-&s;atisfaction upon its account. We fore&s;ee and anticipate its change by the imagination; which makes us little &s;atisfy'd with the thing: We compare it to our|&s;elves, who&s;e exi&s;tence is more durable; by which means its incon&s;tancy appears &s;till greater. It &s;eems ridiculous to infer an excellency in our&s;elves from an object, which is of &s;o much &s;horter duration, and attends us during &s;o &s;mall a part of our exi&s;tence. 'Twill be ea&s;y to com|prehend the rea&s;on, why this cau&s;e ope|rates not with the &s;ame force in joy as in pride; &s;ince the idea of &s;elf is not &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial to the former pa&s;&s;ion as to the latter.</P>
<P N="5">V. I MAY add as a fifth limitation, or rather enlargement of this &s;y&s;tem, that <HI>ge|neral rules</HI> have a great influence upon pride and humility, as well as on all the other pa&s;&s;ions. Hence we form a notion of dif|ferent ranks of men, &s;uitable to the power or riches they are po&s;&s;e&s;t of; and this no|tion
<PB N="33" REF="38">
we change not upon account of any peculiarities of the health or temper of the per&s;ons, which may deprive them of all en|joyment in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. This may be accounted for from the &s;ame principles, that explain'd the influence of general rules on the under&s;tanding. Cu&s;tom readily carries us beyond the ju&s;t bounds in our pa&s;&s;ions, as well as in our rea&s;onings.</P>
<P>IT may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve on this occa&s;ion, that the influence of general rules and maxims on the pa&s;&s;ions very much con|tributes to facilitate the effects of all the principles, which we &s;hall explain in the progre&s;s of this treati&s;e. For 'tis evident, that if a per&s;on full-grown, and of the &s;ame nature with our&s;elves, were on a &s;udden tran&s;|ported into our world, he wou'd be very much embarra&s;s'd with every object, and wou'd not readily find what degree of love or hatred, pride or humility, or any other pa&s;&s;ion he ought to attribute to it. The pa&s;&s;ions are often vary'd by very incon&s;ider|able principles; and the&s;e do not always play with a perfect regularity, e&s;pecially on the fir&s;t trial. But as cu&s;tom and practice have brought to light all the&s;e principles, and have &s;ettled the ju&s;t value of every thing; this mu&s;t certainly contribute to the ea&s;y production of the pa&s;|&s;ions,
<PB N="34" REF="39">
and guide us, by means of general e&s;tab|li&s;h'd maxims, in the proportions we ought to ob&s;erve in preferring one object to another. This remark may, perhaps, &s;erve to obviate difficulties, that may ari&s;e concerning &s;ome cau&s;es, which I &s;hall hereafter a&s;cribe to par|ticular pa&s;&s;ions, and which may be e&s;teem'd too refin'd to operate &s;o univer&s;ally and cer|tainly, as they are found to do.</P>
<P>I SHALL clo&s;e this &s;ubject with a re|flection deriv'd from the&s;e five limitations. This reflection is, that the per&s;ons, who are proude&s;t, and who in the eye of the world have mo&s;t rea&s;on for their pride, are not always the happie&s;t; nor the mo&s;t humble always the mo&s;t mi&s;erable, as may at fir&s;t &s;ight be imagin'd from this &s;y&s;tem. An evil may be real, tho' its cau&s;e has no re|lation to us: It may be real, without be|ing peculiar: It may be real, without &s;hew|ing it&s;elf to others: It may be real, with|out being con&s;tant: And it may be real, without falling under the general rules. Such evils as the&s;e will not fail to render us mi|&s;erable, tho' they have little tendency to dimini&s;h pride: And perhaps the mo&s;t real and the mo&s;t &s;olid evils of life will be found of this nature.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. <HI>Of vice and virtue.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TAKING the&s;e limitations along with us, let us proceed to examine the cau&s;es of pride and humility; and &s;ee, whe|ther in every ca&s;e we can di&s;cover the double relations, by which they operate on the pa&s;|&s;ions. If we find that all the&s;e cau&s;es are related to &s;elf, and produce a plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s &s;eparate from the pa&s;&s;ion, there will remain no farther &s;cruple with regard to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem. We &s;hall princi|pally endeavour to prove the latter point; the former being in a manner &s;elf-evident.</P>
<P>TO begin with VICE and VIRTUE, which are the mo&s;t obvious cau&s;es of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions; 'twou'd be entirely foreign to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to enter upon the contro|ver&s;y, which of late years has &s;o much ex|cited the curio&s;ity of the publick, <HI>whether the&s;e moral di&s;tinctions be founded on natural and original principles, or ari&s;e from inte|re&s;t and education.</HI> The examination of this I re&s;erve for the following book; and in the mean time &s;hall endeavour to &s;how, that my &s;y&s;tem maintains its ground upon
<PB N="36" REF="41">
either of the&s;e hypothe&s;es; which will be a &s;trong proof of its &s;olidity.</P>
<P>FOR granting that morality had no foun|dation in nature, it mu&s;t &s;till be allow'd, that vice and virtue, either from &s;elf-intere&s;t or the prejudices of education, produce in us a real pain and plea&s;ure; and this we may ob&s;erve to be &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted by the defenders of that hypothe&s;is. Every pa&s;&s;ion, habit, or turn of character (&s;ay they) which has a tendency to our advantage or preju|dice, gives a delight or unea&s;ine&s;s; and 'tis from thence the approbation or di&s;-appro|bation ari&s;es. We ea&s;ily gain from the li|berality of others, but are always in danger of lo&s;ing by their avarice: Courage defends us, but cowardice lays us open to every at|tack: Ju&s;tice is the &s;upport of &s;ociety, but inju&s;tice, unle&s;s check'd, wou'd quickly prove its ruin: Humility exalts; but pride mor|tifies us. For the&s;e rea&s;ons the former qua|lities are e&s;teem'd virtues, and the latter re|garded as vices. Now &s;ince 'tis granted there is a delight or unea&s;ine&s;s &s;till attending merit or demerit of every kind, this is all that is requi&s;ite for my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT I go farther, and ob&s;erve, that this moral hypothe&s;is and my pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem not only agree together, but al&s;o that, allow|ing
<PB N="37" REF="42">
the former to be ju&s;t, 'tis an ab&s;olute and invincible proof of the latter. For if all morality be founded on the pain or plea|&s;ure, which ari&s;es from the pro&s;pect of any lo&s;s or advantage, that may re&s;ult from our own characters, or from tho&s;e of others, all the effects of morality mu&s;t be deriv'd from the &s;ame pain or plea&s;ure, and among the re&s;t, the pa&s;&s;ions of pride and humility. The very e&s;&s;ence of virtue, according to this hypothe&s;is, is to produce plea&s;ure, and that of vice to give pain. The virtue and vice mu&s;t be part of our character in order to excite pride or humility. What farther proof can we de&s;ire for the double relation of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas?</P>
<P>THE &s;ame unque&s;tionable argument may be deriv'd from the opinion of tho&s;e, who maintain that morality is &s;omething real, e&s;&s;ential, and founded on nature. The mo&s;t probable hypothe&s;is, which has been ad|vanc'd to explain the di&s;tinction betwixt vice and virtue, and the origin of moral rights and obligations, is, that from a pri|mary con&s;titution of nature certain charac|ters and pa&s;&s;ions, by the very view and con|templation, produce a pain, and others in like manner excite a plea&s;ure. The unea&s;i|ne&s;s and &s;atisfaction are not only in&s;eparable
<PB N="38" REF="43">
from vice and virtue, but con&s;titute their very nature and e&s;&s;ence. To approve of a character is to feel an original delight upon its appearance. To di&s;approve of it is to be &s;en&s;ible of an unea&s;ine&s;s. The pain and plea&s;ure, therefore, being the primary cau&s;es of vice and virtue, mu&s;t al&s;o be the cau&s;es of all their effects, and con&s;equently of pride and humility, which are the unavoidable attendants of that di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;ing this hypothe&s;is of moral philo&s;ophy &s;hou'd be allow'd to be fal&s;e, 'tis &s;till evident, that pain and plea&s;ure, if not the cau&s;es of vice and virtue, are at lea&s;t in&s;eparable from them. A generous and noble character affords a &s;atisfaction even in the &s;urvey; and when pre&s;ented to us, tho' only in a poem or fable, never fails to charm and delight us. On the other hand cruelty and treachery di&s;plea&s;e from their very nature; nor is it po&s;&s;ible ever to recon|cile us to the&s;e qualities, either in our&s;elves or others. Thus one hypothe&s;is of mora|lity is an undeniable proof of the foregoing &s;y&s;tem, and the other at wor&s;t agrees with it.</P>
<P>BUT pride and humility ari&s;e not from the&s;e qualities alone of the mind, which, according to the vulgar &s;y&s;tems of ethicks,
<PB N="39" REF="44">
have been comprehended as parts of moral duty, but from any other that has a con|nexion with plea&s;ure and unea&s;ine&s;s. No|thing flatters our vanity more than the ta|lent of plea&s;ing by our wit, good humour, or any other accompli&s;hment; and nothing gives us a more &s;en&s;ible mortification than a di&s;appointment in any attempt of that na|ture. No one has ever been able to tell what <HI>wit</HI> is, and to &s;hew why &s;uch a &s;y|&s;tem of thought mu&s;t be receiv'd under that denomination, and &s;uch another rejected. 'Tis only by ta&s;te we can decide concerning it, nor are we po&s;&s;e&s;t of any other &s;tandard, upon which we can form a judgment of this kind. Now what is this <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> from which true and fal&s;e wit in a manner receive their being, and without which no thought can have a title to either of the&s;e denomina|tions? 'Tis plainly nothing but a &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure from true wit, and of unea&s;ine&s;s from fal&s;e, without our being able to tell the rea&s;ons of that plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s. The power of be&s;towing the&s;e oppo&s;ite &s;en|&s;ations is, therefore, the very e&s;&s;ence of true and fal&s;e wit; and con&s;equently the cau&s;e of that pride or humility, which ari&s;es from them.</P>
<P>THERE may, perhaps, be &s;ome, who being accu&s;tom'd to the &s;tyle of the &s;chools
<PB N="40" REF="45">
and pulpit, and having never con&s;ider'd hu|man nature in any other light, than that in which <HI>they</HI> place it, may here be &s;ur|priz'd to hear me talk of virtue as exciting pride, which they look upon as a vice; and of vice as producing humility, which they have been taught to con&s;ider as a virtue. But not to di&s;pute about words, I ob&s;erve, that by <HI>pride</HI> I under&s;tand that agreeable impre&s;&s;ion, which ari&s;es in the mind, when the view either of our virtue, beauty, riches or power makes us &s;atisfy'd with our&s;elves: And that by <HI>humility</HI> I mean the oppo&s;ite impre&s;&s;ion. 'Tis evident the former im|pre&s;&s;ion is not always vicious, nor the latter virtuous. The mo&s;t rigid morality allows us to receive a plea&s;ure from reflecting on a generous action; and 'tis by none e&s;|teem'd a virtue to feel any fruitle&s;s remor&s;es upon the thoughts of pa&s;t villiany and ba&s;e|ne&s;s. Let us, therefore, examine the&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions, con&s;ider'd in them&s;elves; and en|quire into their cau&s;es, whether plac'd on the mind or body, without troubling our|&s;elves at pre&s;ent with that merit or blame, which may attend them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. <HI>Of beauty and deformity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHETHER we con&s;ider the body as a part of our&s;elves, or a&s;&s;ent to tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who regard it as &s;ome|thing external, it mu&s;t &s;till be allow'd to be near enough connected with us to form one of the&s;e double relations, which I have a&s;&s;erted to be nece&s;&s;ary to the cau&s;es of pride and humility. Wherever, therefore, we can find the other relation of impre&s;&s;ions to join to this of ideas, we may expect with a&s;&s;urance either of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, according as the impre&s;&s;ion is plea&s;ant or unea&s;y. But <HI>beauty</HI> of all kinds gives us a peculiar de|light and &s;atisfaction; as <HI>deformity</HI> produces pain, upon whatever &s;ubject it may be plac'd, and whether &s;urvey'd in an animate or in|animate object. If the beauty or deformity, therefore, be plac'd upon our own bodies, this plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be con|verted into pride or humility, as having in this ca&s;e all the circum&s;tances requi&s;ite to produce a perfect tran&s;ition of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas. The&s;e oppo&s;ite &s;en&s;ations are re|lated to the oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions. The beauty
<PB N="42" REF="47">
or deformity is clo&s;ely related to &s;elf, the object of both the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. No wonder, then our own beauty becomes an object of pride, and deformity of humility.</P>
<P>BUT this effect of per&s;onal and bodily qualities is not only a proof of the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, by &s;hewing that the pa&s;&s;ions ari&s;e not in this ca&s;e without all the circum|&s;tances I have requir'd, but may be employ'd as a &s;tronger and more convincing argument. If we con&s;ider all the hypothe&s;es, which have been form'd either by philo&s;ophy or common rea&s;on, to explain the difference be|twixt beauty and deformity, we &s;hall find that all of them re&s;olve into this, that beau|ty is &s;uch an order and con&s;truction of parts, as either by the <HI>primary con&s;titution</HI> of our nature, by <HI>cu&s;tom,</HI> or by <HI>caprice,</HI> is fitted to give a plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction to the &s;oul. This is the di&s;tingui&s;hing cha|racter of beauty, and forms all the diffe|rence betwixt it and deformity, who&s;e na|tural tendency is to produce unea&s;ine&s;s. Plea&s;ure and pain, therefore, are not only nece&s;&s;ary attendants of beauty and defor|mity, but con&s;titute their very e&s;&s;ence. And indeed, if we con&s;ider, that a great part of the beauty, which we admire either in ani|mals or in other objects, is deriv'd from the
<PB N="43" REF="48">
idea of convenience and utility, we &s;hall make no &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ent to this opinion. That &s;hape, which produces &s;trength, is beautiful in one animal; and that which is a &s;ign of agility in another. The order and convenience of a palace are no le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to its beauty, than its mere figure and ap|pearance. In like manner the rules of ar|chitecture require, that the top of a pillar &s;hou'd be more &s;lender than its ba&s;e, and that becau&s;e &s;uch a figure conveys to us the idea of &s;ecurity, which is plea&s;ant; where|as the contrary form gives us the apprehen|&s;ion of danger, which is unea&s;y. From in|numerable in&s;tances of this kind, as well as from con&s;idering that beauty like wit, cannot be defin'd, but is di&s;cern'd only by a ta&s;te or &s;en&s;ation, we may conclude, that beauty is nothing but a form, which pro|duces plea&s;ure, as deformity is a &s;tructure of parts, which conveys pain; and &s;ince the power of producing pain and plea&s;ure make in this manner the e&s;&s;ence of beauty and deformity, all the effects of the&s;e qualities mu&s;t be deriv'd from the &s;en&s;ation; and a|mong the re&s;t pride and humility, which of all their effects are the mo&s;t common and remarkable.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="49">
THIS argument I e&s;teem ju&s;t and deci|&s;ive; but in order to give greater authori|ty to the pre&s;ent rea&s;oning, let us &s;uppo&s;e it fal&s;e for a moment, and &s;ee what will follow. 'Tis certain, then, that if the power of pro|ducing plea&s;ure and pain forms not the e&s;&s;ence of beauty and deformity, the &s;en&s;ations are at lea&s;t in&s;eparable from the qualities, and 'tis even difficult to con&s;ider them apart. Now there is nothing common to natural and moral beauty, (both of which are the cau&s;es of pride) but this power of producing plea|&s;ure; and as a common effect &s;uppo&s;es always a common cau&s;e, 'tis plain the plea&s;ure mu&s;t in both ca&s;es be the real and influencing cau&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ion. Again; there is no|thing originally different betwixt the beauty of our bodies and the beauty of external and foreign objects, but that the one has a near relation to our&s;elves, which is wanting in the other. This original difference, there|fore, mu&s;t be the cau&s;e of all their other differences, and among the re&s;t, of their dif|ferent influence upon the pa&s;&s;ion of pride, which is excited by the beauty of our per|&s;on, but is not affected in the lea&s;t by that of foreign and external objects. Placing, then, the&s;e two conclu&s;ions together, we find they compo&s;e the preceding &s;y&s;tem betwixt
<PB N="45" REF="50">
them, <HI>viz.</HI> that plea&s;ure, as a related or re|&s;embling impre&s;&s;ion, when plac'd on a re|lated object, by a natural tran&s;ition, pro|duces pride; and its contrary, humility. This &s;y&s;tem, then, &s;eems already &s;ufficient|ly confirm'd by experience; tho' we have not yet exhau&s;ted all our arguments.</P>
<P>'TIS not the beauty of the body alone that produces pride, but al&s;o its &s;trength and force. Strength is a kind of power; and therefore the de&s;ire to excel in &s;trength is to be con&s;ider'd as an inferior &s;pecies of <HI>am|bition.</HI> For this rea&s;on the pre&s;ent phaeno|menon will be &s;ufficiently accounted for, in explaining that pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>CONCERNING all other bodily accom|pli&s;hments we may ob&s;erve in general, that whatever in our&s;elves is either u&s;eful, beau|tiful, or &s;urpri&s;ing, is an object of pride; and it's contrary, of humility. Now 'tis obvious, that every thing u&s;eful, beautiful or &s;urpri&s;ing, agrees in producing a &s;eparate plea&s;ure, and agrees in nothing el&s;e. The plea&s;ure, therefore, with the relation to &s;elf mu&s;t be the cau&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THO' it &s;hou'd be que&s;tion'd, whether beauty be not &s;omething real, and different from the power of producing plea&s;ure, it can never be di&s;puted, that as &s;urprize is no|thing
<PB N="46" REF="51">
but a plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from novelty, it is not, properly &s;peaking, a quality in any object, but merely a pa&s;&s;ion or impre&s;&s;ion in the &s;oul. It mu&s;t, therefore, be from that impre&s;&s;ion, that pride by a natural tran|&s;ition ari&s;es. And it ari&s;es &s;o naturally, that there is nothing <HI>in us or belonging to us,</HI> which produces &s;urprize, that does not at the &s;ame time excite that other pa&s;&s;ion. Thus we are vain of the &s;urpri&s;ing adventures we have met with, the e&s;capes we have made, and dangers we have been expos'd to. Hence the origin of vulgar lying; where men with|out any intere&s;t, and merely out of vanity, heap up a number of extraordinary events, which are either the fictions of their brain, or if true, have at lea&s;t no connexion with them&s;elves. Their fruitful invention &s;upplies them with a variety of adventures; and and where that talent is wanting, they ap|propriate &s;uch as belong to others, in order to &s;atisfy their vanity.</P>
<P>IN this phaenomenon are contain'd two curious experiments, which if we compare them together, according to the known rules, by which we judge of cau&s;e and effect in anatomy, natural philo&s;ophy, and other &s;ciences, will be an undeniable argument for that influence of the double relations above|mention'd.
<PB N="47" REF="52">
By one of the&s;e experiments we find, that an object produces pride mere|ly by the interpo&s;ition of plea&s;ure; and that becau&s;e the quality, by which it produces pride, is in reality nothing but the power of producing plea&s;ure. By the other experi|ment we find, that the plea&s;ure produces the pride by a tran&s;ition along related ideas; be|cau&s;e when we cut off that relation the pa&s;|&s;ion is immediately de&s;troy'd. A &s;urpri&s;ing adventure, in which we have been our&s;elves engag'd, is related to us, and by that means produces pride: But the adventures of o|thers, tho' they may cau&s;e plea&s;ure, yet for want of this relation of ideas, never excite that pa&s;&s;ion. What farther proof can be de&s;ired for the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem?</P>
<P>THERE is only one objection to this &s;y&s;tem with regard to our body; which is, that tho' nothing be more agreeable than health, and more painful than &s;ick|ne&s;s, yet commonly men are neither proud of the one, nor mortify'd with the other. This will ea&s;ily be accounted for, if we con&s;ider the <HI>&s;econd</HI> and <HI>fourth</HI> limitations, propos'd to our general &s;y&s;tem. It was ob&s;erv'd, that no object ever produces pride or humility, if it has not &s;omething <HI>pe|culiar</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="53">
to our&s;elf; as al&s;o, that every cau&s;e of that pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be in &s;ome mea&s;ure <HI>con&s;tant,</HI> and hold &s;ome proportion to the duration of our&s;elf, which is its object. Now as health and &s;ickne&s;s vary ince&s;|&s;antly to all men, and there is none, who is <HI>&s;olely</HI> or <HI>certainly</HI> fix'd in either, the&s;e accidental ble&s;&s;ings and calamities are in a manner &s;eparated from us, and are never con&s;ider'd as connected with our be|ing and exi&s;tence. And that this account is ju&s;t appears hence, that wherever a ma|lady of any kind is &s;o rooted in our con|&s;titution, that we no longer entertain any hopes of recovery, from that moment it be|comes an object of humility; as is evident in old men, whom nothing mortifies more than the con&s;ideration of their age and in|firmities. They endeavour, as long as po&s;|&s;ible, to conceal their blindne&s;s and deaf|ne&s;s, their rheums and gouts; nor do they ever confe&s;s them without reluctance and unea&s;ine&s;s. And tho' young men are not a&s;ham'd of every head-ach or cold they fall into, yet no topic is &s;o proper to mortify human pride, and make us entertain a mean opinion of our nature, than this, that we are every moment of our lives &s;ubject to
<PB N="49" REF="54">
&s;uch infirmities. This &s;ufficiently proves that bodily pain and &s;ickne&s;s are in them&s;elves proper cau&s;es of humility; tho' the cu&s;tom of e&s;timating every thing by compari&s;on more than by its intrin&s;ic worth and value, makes us overlook the&s;e calamities, which we find to be incident to every one, and cau&s;es us to form an idea of our merit and character independent of them.</P>
<P>WE are a&s;ham'd of &s;uch maladies as af|fect others, and are either dangerous or di&s;|agreeable to them. Of the epilep&s;y; be|cau&s;e it gives a horror to every one pre&s;ent: Of the itch; becau&s;e it is infectious: Of the king's-evil; becau&s;e it commonly goes to po&s;terity. Men always con&s;ider the &s;en|timents of others in their judgment of them&s;elves. This has evidently appear'd in &s;ome of the foregoing rea&s;onings; and will appear &s;till more evidently, and be more fully explain'd afterwards.</P>

<P>BUT tho' pride and humility have the qualities of our mind and body, that is <HI>&s;elf,</HI> for their natural and more immediate cau&s;es, we find by experience, that there are many other objects, which produce the&s;e affections, and that the primary one is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, ob&s;cur'd and lo&s;t by the mul|tiplicity of foreign and extrin&s;ic. We found a vanity upon hou&s;es, gardens, equipages, as well as upon per&s;onal merit and accom|pli&s;hments; and tho' the&s;e external advan|tages be in them&s;elves widely di&s;tant from thought or a per&s;on, yet they con&s;iderably influence even a pa&s;&s;ion, which is directed to that as its ultimate object. This happens when external objects acquire any particular relation to our&s;elves, and are a&s;&s;ociated or connected with us. A beautiful fi&s;h in the ocean, an animal in a de&s;art, and in|deed any thing that neither belongs, nor is related to us, has no manner of influence on our vanity, whatever extraordinary qua|lities
<PB N="51" REF="56">
it may be endow'd with, and what|ever degree of &s;urprize and admiration it may naturally occa&s;ion. It mu&s;t be &s;ome way a&s;&s;ociated with us in order to touch our pride. Its idea mu&s;t hang in a manner, upon that of our&s;elves; and the tran&s;ition from the one to the other mu&s;t be ea&s;y and natural.</P>
<P>BUT here 'tis remarkable, that tho' the relation of <HI>re&s;emblance</HI> operates upon the mind in the &s;ame manner as contiguity and cau&s;ation, in conveying us from one idea to another, yet 'tis &s;eldom a foundation either of pride or of humility. If we re&s;emble a per&s;on in any of the valuable parts of his character, we mu&s;t, in &s;ome degree, po&s;&s;e&s;s the quality, in which we re&s;emble him; and this quality we always chu&s;e to &s;urvey directly in our&s;elves rather than by re|flexion in another per&s;on, when we wou'd found upon it any degree of vanity. So that tho' a likene&s;s may occa&s;ionally produce that pa&s;&s;ion by &s;ugge&s;ting a more advan|tageous idea of our&s;elves, 'tis there the view fixes at la&s;t, and the pa&s;&s;ion finds its ultimate and final cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE are in&s;tances, indeed, wherein men &s;hew a vanity in re&s;embling a great man in his countenance, &s;hape, air, or other
<PB N="52" REF="57">
minute circum&s;tances, that contribute not in any degree to his reputation; but it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that this extends not very far, nor is of any con&s;iderable moment in the&s;e affections. For this I a&s;&s;ign the following rea&s;on. We can never have a vanity of re|&s;embling in trifles any per&s;on, unle&s;s he be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of very &s;hining qualities, which give us a re&s;pect and veneration for him. The&s;e qualities, then, are, properly &s;peak|ing, the cau&s;es of our vanity, by means of their relation to our&s;elves. Now after what manner are they related to our&s;elves? They are parts of the per&s;on we value, and con|&s;equently connected with the&s;e trifles; which are al&s;o &s;uppos'd to be parts of him. The&s;e trifles are connected with the re&s;embling qua|lities in us; and the&s;e qualities in us, being parts, are connected with the whole; and by that means form a chain of &s;everal links betwixt our&s;elves and the &s;hining qualities of the per&s;on we re&s;emble. But be&s;ides that this multitude of relations mu&s;t weaken the connexion; 'tis evident the mind, in pa&s;&s;ing from the &s;hining qualities to the tri|vial ones, mu&s;t by that contra&s;t the better perceive the minutene&s;s of the latter, and be in &s;ome mea&s;ure a&s;ham'd of the compa|ri&s;on and re&s;emblance.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="58">
THE relation, therefore, of contiguity, or that of cau&s;ation, betwixt the cau&s;e and object of pride and humility, is alone requi|&s;ite to give ri&s;e to the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions; and the&s;e relations are nothing el&s;e but qualities, by which the imagination is convey'd from one idea to another. Now let us con&s;ider what effect the&s;e can po&s;&s;ibly have upon the mind, and by what means they become &s;o requi&s;ite to the production of the pa&s;&s;ions. 'Tis evident, that the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas operates in &s;o &s;ilent and imperceptible a manner, that we are &s;carce &s;en&s;ible of it, and di&s;cover it more by its effects than by any immediate feeling or perception. It produces no emotion, and gives ri&s;e to no new im|pre&s;&s;ion of any kind, but only modifies tho&s;e ideas, of which the mind was formerly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and which it cou'd recal upon oc|ca&s;ion. From this rea&s;oning, as well as from undoubted experience, we may con|clude, that an a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, however nece&s;&s;ary, is not alone &s;ufficient to give ri&s;e to any pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, then, that when the mind feels the pa&s;&s;ion either of pride or humility upon the appearance of a related object, there is, be&s;ide the relation or tran&s;ition of thought, an emotion or original impre&s;&s;ion produc'd
<PB N="54" REF="59">
by &s;ome other principle. The que&s;tion is, whether the emotion fir&s;t produc'd be the pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, or &s;ome other impre&s;&s;ion rela|ted to it. This que&s;tion we cannot be long in deciding. For be&s;ides all the other argu|ments, with which this &s;ubject abounds, it mu&s;t evidently appear, that the relation of ideas, which experience &s;hews to be &s;o re|qui&s;ite a circum&s;tance to the production of the pa&s;&s;ion, wou'd be entirely &s;uperflu|ous, were it not to &s;econd a relation of af|fections, and facilitate the tran&s;ition from one impre&s;&s;ion to another. If nature pro|duc'd immediately the pa&s;&s;ion of pride or humility, it wou'd be compleated in it|&s;elf, and wou'd require no farther addition or encrea&s;e from any other affection. But &s;uppo&s;ing the fir&s;t emotion to be only rela|ted to pride or humility, 'tis ea&s;ily con|ceiv'd to what purpo&s;e the relation of objects may &s;erve, and how the two different a&s;&s;o|ciations, of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, by uniting their forces, may a&s;&s;i&s;t each other's opera|tion. This is not only ea&s;ily conceiv'd, but I will venture to affirm 'tis the only man|ner, in which we can conceive this &s;ubject. An ea&s;y tran&s;ition of ideas, which, of it&s;elf, cau&s;es no emotion, can never be nece&s;&s;ary, or even u&s;eful to the pa&s;&s;ions, but by for|warding
<PB N="55" REF="60">
the tran&s;ition betwixt &s;ome related impre&s;&s;ions. Not to mention, that the &s;ame object cau&s;es a greater or &s;maller de|gree of pride, not only in proportion to the encrea&s;e or decrea&s;e of its qualities, but al|&s;o to the di&s;tance or nearne&s;s of the rela|lation; which is a clear argument for the tran&s;ition of affections along the relation of ideas; &s;ince every change in the relation produces a proportionable change in the pa&s;|&s;ion. Thus one part of the preceding &s;y&s;|tem, concerning the relations of ideas is a &s;ufficient proof of the other, concerning that of impre&s;&s;ions; and is it&s;elf &s;o evidently founded on experience, that 'twou'd be lo&s;t time to endeavour farther to prove it.</P>
<P>THIS will appear &s;till more evidently in particular in&s;tances. Men are vain of the beauty of their country, of their county, of their pari&s;h. Here the idea of beauty plainly produces a plea&s;ure. This plea&s;ure is related to pride. The object or cau&s;e of this plea&s;ure is, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, related to &s;elf, or the object of pride. By this double relation of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, a tran&s;i|tion is made from the one impre&s;&s;ion to the other.</P>
<P>MEN are al&s;o vain of the temperature of the climate, in which they were born; of
<PB N="56" REF="61">
the fertility of their native &s;oil; of the good|ne&s;s of the wines, fruits or victuals, produc'd by it; of the &s;oftne&s;s or force of their language; with other particulars of that kind. The&s;e objects have plainly a reference to the plea|&s;ures of the &s;en&s;es, and are originally con|&s;ider'd as agreeable to the feeling, ta&s;te or hearing. How is it po&s;&s;ible they cou'd ever become objects of pride, except by means of that tran&s;ition above-explain'd?</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome, that di&s;cover a vanity of an oppo&s;ite kind, and affect to depre|ciate their own country, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e, to which they have travell'd. The&s;e per&s;ons find, when they are at home, and &s;urrounded with their countrymen, that the &s;trong relation betwixt them and their own nation is &s;har'd with &s;o many, that 'tis in a manner lo&s;t to them; whereas their di&s;tant relation to a foreign country, which is form'd by their having &s;een it and liv'd in it, is augmented by their con&s;idering how few there are who have done the &s;ame. For this rea&s;on they always admire the beauty, utility and rarity of what is a|broad, above what is at home.</P>
<P>SINCE we can be vain of a country, climate or any inanimate object, which bears a relation to us, 'tis no wonder we are vain
<PB N="57" REF="62">
of the qualities of tho&s;e, who are connected with us by blood or friend&s;hip. Accord|ingly we find, that the very &s;ame qualities, which in our&s;elves produce pride, produce al&s;o in a le&s;&s;er degree the &s;ame affection, when di&s;cover'd in per&s;ons related to us. The beauty, addre&s;s, merit, credit and honours of their kindred are carefully di&s;play'd by the proud, as &s;ome of their mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble &s;ources of their vanity.</P>
<P>AS we are proud of riches in our&s;elves, &s;o to &s;atisfy our vanity we de&s;ire that every one, who has any connexion with us, &s;hou'd likewi&s;e be po&s;&s;e&s;t of them, and are a&s;ham'd of any one, that is mean or poor, among our friends and relations. For this rea&s;on we remove the poor as far from us as po&s;|&s;ible; and as we cannot prevent poverty in &s;ome di&s;tant collaterals, and our forefathers are taken to be our neare&s;t relations; upon this account every one affects to be of a good family, and to be de&s;cended from a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of rich and honourable ance&s;|tors.</P>
<P>I HAVE frequently ob&s;erv'd, that tho&s;e, who boa&s;t of the antiquity of their fami|lies, are glad when they can join this cir|cum&s;tance, that their ance&s;tors for many ge|nerations have been uninterrupted proprie|tors
<PB N="58" REF="63">
of the &s;ame portion of land, and that their family has never chang'd its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, or been tran&s;planted into any other county or province. I have al&s;o ob&s;erv'd, that 'tis an additional &s;ubject of vanity, when they can boa&s;t, that the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions have been tran&s;mitted thro' a de&s;cent compos'd entire|ly of males, and that the honours and for|tune have never pa&s;t thro' any female. Let us endeavour to explain the&s;e phaenomena by the foregoing &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that when any one boa&s;ts of the antiquity of his family, the &s;ubjects of his vanity are not merely the extent of time and number of ance&s;tors, but al&s;o their riches and credit, which are &s;uppos'd to re|flect a lu&s;tre on him&s;elf on account of his relation to them. He fir&s;t con&s;iders the&s;e objects; is affected by them in an agreeable manner; and then returning back to him|&s;elf, thro' the relation of parent and child, is elevated with the pa&s;&s;ion of pride, by means of the double relation of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas. Since therefore the pa&s;&s;ion de|pends on the&s;e relations, whatever &s;trengthens any of the relations mu&s;t al&s;o encrea&s;e the pa&s;&s;ion, and whatever weakens the relations mu&s;t dimini&s;h the pa&s;&s;ion. Now 'tis cer|tain the identity of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;trengthens
<PB N="59" REF="64">
the relation of ideas ari&s;ing from blood and kindred, and conveys the fancy with greater facility from one generation to another, from the remote&s;t ance&s;tors to their po&s;terity, who are both their heirs and their de&s;cend|ants. By this facility the impre&s;&s;ion is tran&s;|mitted more entire, and excites a greater degree of pride and vanity.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e is the &s;ame with the tran&s;|mi&s;&s;ion of the honours and fortune thro' a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of males without their pa&s;&s;ing thro' any female. 'Tis a quality of human na|ture, which we &s;hall con&s;ider <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part II. Sect. 2.</NOTE> afterwards, that the imagination naturally turns to what|ever is important and con&s;iderable; and where two objects are pre&s;ented to it, a &s;mall and a great one, u&s;ually leaves the former, and dwells entirely upon the latter. As in the &s;ociety of marriage, the male &s;ex has the advantage above the female, the hu&s;band fir&s;t engages our attention; and whether we con&s;ider him directly, or reach him by pa&s;&s;ing thro' related objects, the thought both re&s;ts upon him with greater &s;atisfac|tion, and arrives at him with greater fa|cility than his con&s;ort. 'Tis ea&s;y to &s;ee, that this property mu&s;t &s;trengthen the child's relation to the father, and weaken that to
<PB N="60" REF="65">
the mother. For as all relations are nothing but a propen&s;ity to pa&s;s from one idea to another, whatever &s;trengthens the propen|&s;ity &s;trengthens the relation; and as we have a &s;tronger propen&s;ity to pa&s;s from the idea of the children to that of the father, than from the &s;ame idea to that of the mother, we ought to regard the former relation as the clo&s;er and more con&s;iderable. This is the rea&s;on why children commonly bear their father's name, and are e&s;teem'd to be of nobler or ba&s;er birth, according to <HI>his</HI> fa|mily. And tho' the mother &s;hou'd be po&s;|&s;e&s;t of a &s;uperior &s;pirit and genius to the father, as often happens, the <HI>general rule</HI> prevails, notwith&s;tanding the exception, ac|cording to the doctrine above-explain'd. Nay even when a &s;uperiority of any kind is &s;o great, or when any other rea&s;ons have &s;uch an effect, as to make the children rather repre&s;ent the mother's family than the father's, the gene|ral rule &s;till retains &s;uch an efficacy that it weakens the relation, and makes a kind of break in the line of ance&s;tors. The ima|gination runs not along them with facility, nor is able to transfer the honour and cre|dit of the ance&s;tors to their po&s;terity of the &s;ame name and family &s;o readily, as when the tran&s;ition is conformable to the general
<PB N="61" REF="66">
rules, and pa&s;&s;es from father to &s;on, or from brother to brother.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">

<P>BUT the relation, which is e&s;teem'd the clo&s;e&s;t, and which of all others produces mo&s;t commonly the pa&s;&s;ion of pride, is that of <HI>property.</HI> This relation 'twill be impo&s;&s;ible for me fully to ex|plain before I come to treat of ju&s;tice and the other moral virtues. 'Tis &s;uffi|cient to ob&s;erve on this occa&s;ion, that pro|perty may be defin'd, <HI>&s;uch a relation be|twixt a per&s;on and an object as permits him, but forbids any other, the free u&s;e and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, without violating the laws of ju&s;tice and moral equity.</HI> If ju&s;tice, there|fore, be a virtue, which has a natural and original influence on the human mind, pro|perty may be look'd upon as a particular &s;pe|cies of <HI>cau&s;ation;</HI> whether we con&s;ider the liberty it gives the proprietor to operate as he plea&s;e upon the object, or the advantages, which he reaps from it. 'Tis the &s;ame ca&s;e, if ju&s;tice, according to the &s;y&s;tem of certain philo&s;ophers, &s;hou'd be e&s;teem'd an
<PB N="62" REF="67">
artificial and not a natural virtue. For then honour, and cu&s;tom, and civil laws &s;upply the place of natural con&s;cience, and produce, in &s;ome degree, the &s;ame effects. This in the mean time is certain, that the men|tion of the property naturally carries our thought to the proprietor, and of the pro|prietor to the property; which being a proof of a perfect relation of ideas is all that is requi&s;ite to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. A relation of ideas, join'd to that of impre&s;&s;ions, al|ways produces a tran&s;ition of affections; and therefore, whenever any plea&s;ure or pain a|ri&s;es from an object, connected with us by property, we may be certain, that either pride or humility mu&s;t ari&s;e from this conjunction of relations; if the foregoing &s;y&s;tem be &s;olid and &s;atisfactory. And whether it be &s;o or not, we may &s;oon &s;atisfy our&s;elves by the mo&s;t cur&s;ory view of human life.</P>
<P>EVERY thing belonging to a vain man is the be&s;t that is any where to be found. His hou&s;es, equipage, furniture, cloaths, hor&s;es, hounds, excel all others in his con|ceit; and 'tis ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that from the lea&s;t advantage in any of the&s;e, he draws a new &s;ubject of pride and vanity. His wine, if you'll believe him, has a finer flavour than any other; his cookery is more ex|qui&s;ite;
<PB N="63" REF="68">
his table more orderly; his &s;ervants more expert; the air, in which he lives, more healthful; the &s;oil he cultivates more fertile; his fruits ripen earlier and to greater perfection: Such a thing is remarkable for its novelty; &s;uch another for its antiquity: This is the workman&s;hip of a famous arti&s;t; that belong'd once to &s;uch a prince or great man: All objects, in a word, that are u&s;eful, beautiful ot &s;urprizing, or are related to &s;uch, may, by means of property, give ri&s;e to this pa&s;&s;ion. The&s;e agree in giving plea&s;ure, and agree in nothing el&s;e. This alone is com|mon to them; and therefore mu&s;t be the quality that produces the pa&s;&s;ion, which is their common effect. As every new in|&s;tance is a new argument, and as the in|&s;tances are here without number, I may venture to affirm, that &s;carce any &s;y&s;tem was ever &s;o fully prov'd by experience, as that which I have here advanc'd.</P>
<P>IF the property of any thing, that gives plea&s;ure either by its utility, beauty or no|velty, produces al&s;o pride by a double re|lation of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas; we need not be &s;urpriz'd, that the power of acquiring this property, &s;hou'd have the &s;ame effect. Now riches are to be con&s;ider'd as the power of acquiring the property of what plea&s;es;
<PB N="64" REF="69">
and 'tis only in this view they have any influence on the pa&s;&s;ions. Paper will, on many occa&s;ions, be con&s;ider'd as riches, and that becau&s;e it may convey the power of acquiring money: And money is not riches, as it is a metal endow'd with certain qua|lities of &s;olidity, weight and fu&s;ibility; but only as it has a relation to the plea&s;ures and conveniences of life. Taking then this for granted, which is in it&s;elf &s;o evident, we may draw from it one of the &s;tronge&s;t argu|ments I have yet employ'd to prove the in|fluence of the double relations on pride and humility.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erv'd in treating of the under&s;tanding, that the di&s;tinction, which we &s;ometimes make betwixt a <HI>power</HI> and the <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> of it, is entirely frivolous, and that neither man nor any other being ought ever to be thought po&s;&s;e&s;t of any ability, unle&s;s it be exerted and put in action. But tho' this be &s;trictly true in a ju&s;t and <HI>philo&s;ophi|cal</HI> way of thinking, 'tis certain it is not <HI>the philo&s;ophy</HI> of our pa&s;&s;ions; but that many things operate upon them by means of the idea and &s;uppo&s;ition of power, independent of its actual exerci&s;e. We are pleas'd when we acquire an ability of procuring plea&s;ure, and are di&s;pleas'd when another acquires a
<PB N="65" REF="70">
power of giving pain. This is evident from experience; but in order to give a ju&s;t ex|plication of the matter, and account for this &s;atisfaction and unea&s;ine&s;s, we mu&s;t weigh the following reflections.</P>
<P>'TIS evident the error of di&s;tingui&s;hing power from its exerci&s;e proceeds not entire|ly from the &s;chola&s;tic doctrine of <HI>free-will,</HI> which, indeed, enters very little into com|mon life, and has but &s;mall influence on our vulgar and popular ways of thinking. Ac|cording to that doctrine, motives deprive us not of free-will, nor take away our power of performing or forbearing any action. But according to common notions a man has no power, where very con&s;iderable motives lie betwixt him and the &s;atisfaction of his de|&s;ires, and determine him to forbear what he wi&s;hes to perform. I do not think I have fallen into my enemies power, when I &s;ee him pa&s;s me in the &s;treets with a &s;word by his &s;ide, while I am unprovided of any weapon. I know that the fear of the civil magi&s;trate is as &s;trong a re&s;traint as any of iron, and that I am in as perfect &s;afety as if he were chain'd or impri&s;on'd. But when a per&s;on acquires &s;uch an autho|rity over me, that not only there is no ex|ternal ob&s;tacle to his actions; but al&s;o that
<PB N="66" REF="71">
he may puni&s;h or reward me as he plea&s;es, without any dread of puni&s;hment in his turn, I then attribute a full power to him, and con&s;ider my&s;elf as his &s;ubject or va&s;&s;al.</P>
<P>NOW if we compare the&s;e two ca&s;es, that of a per&s;on, who has very &s;trong mo|tives of intere&s;t or &s;afety to forbear any ac|tion, and that of another, who lies under no &s;uch obligation, we &s;hall find, according to the philo&s;ophy explain'd in the foregoing book, that the only <HI>known</HI> difference be|twixt them lies in this, that in the former ca&s;e we conclude from <HI>pa&s;t experience,</HI> that the per&s;on never will perform that action, and in the latter, that he po&s;&s;ibly or pro|bably will perform it. Nothing is more fluctuating and incon&s;tant on many occa|&s;ions, than the will of man; nor is there any thing but &s;trong motives, which can give us an ab&s;olute certainty in pronounc|ing concerning any of his future actions. When we &s;ee a per&s;on free from the&s;e mo|tives, we &s;uppo&s;e a po&s;&s;ibility either of his acting or forbearing; and tho' in general we may conclude him to be determin'd by motives and cau&s;es, yet this removes not the uncertainty of our judgment concerning the&s;e cau&s;es, nor the influence of that un|certainty on the pa&s;&s;ions. Since therefore
<PB N="67" REF="72">
we a&s;cribe a power of performing an action to every one, who has no very powerful motive to forbear it, and refu&s;e it to &s;uch as have; it may ju&s;tly be concluded, that <HI>power</HI> has always a reference to its <HI>ex|erci&s;e,</HI> either actual or probable, and that we con&s;ider a per&s;on as endow'd with any abi|lity when we find from pa&s;t experience, that 'tis probable, or at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible he may exert it. And indeed, as our pa&s;&s;ions al|ways regard the real exi&s;tence of objects, and we always judge of this reality from pa&s;t in&s;tances; nothing can be more likely of it&s;elf, without any farther rea&s;oning, than that power con&s;i&s;ts in the po&s;&s;ibility or pro|bability of any action, as di&s;cover'd by ex|perience and the practice of the world.</P>
<P>NOW 'tis evident, that wherever a per&s;on is in &s;uch a &s;ituation with regard to me, that there is no very powerful motive to deter him from injuring me, and con&s;equently 'tis <HI>uncertain</HI> whether he will injure me or not, I mu&s;t be unea&s;y in &s;uch a &s;ituation, and cannot con&s;ider the po&s;&s;ibility or probabi|lity of that injury without a &s;en&s;ible con|cern. The pa&s;&s;ions are not only affected by &s;uch events as are certain and infallible, but al&s;o in an inferior degree by &s;uch as are po&s;&s;ible and contingent. And tho' per|haps
<PB N="68" REF="73">
I never really feel any harm, and di&s;cover by the event, that, philo&s;ophically &s;peaking, the per&s;on never had any power of harming me; &s;ince he did not exert any; this prevents not my unea&s;ine&s;s from the preceding uncertainty. The agreeable pa&s;|&s;ions may here operate as well as the un|ea&s;y, and convey a plea&s;ure when I per|ceive a good to become either po&s;&s;ible or probable by the po&s;&s;ibility or probability of another's be&s;towing it on me, upon the re|moval of any &s;trong motives, which might formerly have hinder'd him.</P>
<P>BUT we may farther ob&s;erve, that this &s;atisfaction encrea&s;es, when any good ap|proaches in &s;uch a manner that it is in one's <HI>own</HI> power to take or leave it, and there neither is any phy&s;ical impediment, nor any very &s;trong motive to hinder our enjoyment. As all men de&s;ire plea&s;ure, nothing can be more probable, than its exi&s;tence when there is no external ob&s;tacle to the producing it, and men perceive no danger in fol|lowing their inclinations. In that ca&s;e their imagination ea&s;ily anticipates the &s;atisfac|tion, and conveys the &s;ame joy, as if they were per&s;waded of its real and actual ex|i&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="74">
BUT this accounts not &s;ufficiently for the &s;atisfaction, which attends riches. A mi&s;er receives delight from his money; that is, from the <HI>power</HI> it affords him of procuring all the plea&s;ures and conveniences of life, tho' he knows he has enjoy'd his riches for forty years without ever employing them; and con&s;equently cannot conclude by any &s;pecies of rea&s;oning, that the real exi&s;tence of the&s;e plea&s;ures is nearer, than if he were entirely depriv'd of all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. But tho' he cannot form any &s;uch conclu&s;ion in a way of rea&s;oning concerning the nearer approach of the plea&s;ure, 'tis certain he <HI>imagines</HI> it to approach nearer, whenever all external ob&s;tacles are remov'd, along with the more powerful motives of intere&s;t and danger, which oppo&s;e it. For farther &s;ati&s;|faction on this head I mu&s;t refer to my ac|count of the will, where I &s;hall <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part III. Sect. 2.</NOTE> explain that fal&s;e &s;en&s;ation of liberty, which makes us imagine we can perform any thing, that is not very dangerous or de&s;tructive. Whenever any other per&s;on is under no &s;trong obligations of intere&s;t to forbear any plea&s;ure, we judge from <HI>experience,</HI> that the plea&s;ure will exi&s;t, and that he will pro|bably obtain it. But when our&s;elves are
<PB N="70" REF="75">
in that &s;ituation, we judge from an <HI>illu&s;ion of the fancy,</HI> that the plea&s;ure is &s;till clo&s;er and more immediate. The will &s;eems to move ea&s;ily every way, and ca&s;ts a &s;ha|dow or image of it&s;elf, even to that &s;ide, on which it did not &s;ettle. By means of this image the enjoyment &s;eems to approach nearer to us, and gives us the &s;ame lively &s;atisfaction, as if it were perfectly certain and unavoidable.</P>
<P>'TWILL now be ea&s;y to draw this whole rea&s;oning to a point, and to prove, that when riches produce any pride or vanity in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, as they never fail to do, 'tis only by means of a double relation of impre&s;|&s;ions and ideas. The very e&s;&s;ence of riches con&s;i&s;ts in the power of procuring the plea|&s;ures and conveniences of life. The very e&s;&s;ence of this power con&s;i&s;ts in the proba|bility of its exerci&s;e, and in its cau&s;ing us to anticipate, by a <HI>true</HI> or <HI>fal&s;e</HI> rea&s;oning, the real exi&s;tence of the plea&s;ure. This an|ticipation of plea&s;ure is, in it&s;elf, a very con|&s;iderable plea&s;ure; and as its cau&s;e is &s;ome po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or property, which we enjoy, and which is thereby related to us, we here clearly &s;ee all the parts of the foregoing &s;y&s;tem mo&s;t exactly and di&s;tinctly drawn out before us.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="76">
FOR the &s;ame rea&s;on, that riches cau&s;e plea&s;ure and pride, and poverty excites un|ea&s;ine&s;s and humility, power mu&s;t produce the former emotions, and &s;lavery the latter. Power or an authority over others makes us capable of &s;atisfying all our de&s;ires; as &s;la|very, by &s;ubjecting us to the will of others, expo&s;es us to a thou&s;and wants, and mortifi|cations.</P>
<P>'TIS here worth ob&s;erving, that the va|nity of power, or &s;hame of &s;lavery, are much augmented by the con&s;ideration of the per&s;ons, over whom we exerci&s;e our au|thority, or who exerci&s;e it over us. For &s;up|po&s;ing it po&s;&s;ible to frame &s;tatues of &s;uch an admirable mechani&s;m, that they cou'd move and act in obedience to the will; 'tis evident the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them wou'd give plea&s;ure and pride, but not to &s;uch a de|gree, as the &s;ame authority, when exerted over &s;en&s;ible and rational creatures, who&s;e condition, being compar'd to our own, makes it &s;eem more agreeable and honourable. Compari&s;on is in every ca&s;e a &s;ure method of augmenting our e&s;teem of any thing. A rich man feels the felicity of his condi|tion better by oppo&s;ing it to that of a beg|gar. But there is a peculiar advantage in power, by the contra&s;t, which is, in a man|ner,
<PB N="72" REF="77">
pre&s;ented to us, betwixt our&s;elves and the per&s;on we command. The compari&s;on is obvious and natural: The imagination finds it in the very &s;ubject: The pa&s;&s;age of the thought to its conception is &s;mooth and ea&s;y. And that this circum&s;tance has a con&s;iderable effect in augmenting its influ|ence, will appear afterwards in examining the nature of <HI>malice</HI> and <HI>envy.</HI></P>

<P>BUT be&s;ide the&s;e original cau&s;es of pride and humility, there is a &s;econ|dary one in the opinions of others, which has an equal influence on the affections. Our reputation, our character, our name are con&s;iderations of va&s;t weight and impor|tance; and even the other cau&s;es of pride; virtue, beauty and riches; have little influ|ence, when not &s;econded by the opinions and &s;entiments of others. In order to ac|count for this phaenomenon 'twill be nece&s;|&s;ary to take &s;ome compa&s;s, and fir&s;t explain the nature of <HI>&s;ympathy.</HI></P>
<P>NO quality of human nature is more re|markable, both in it&s;elf and in its con&s;e|quences,
<PB N="73" REF="78">
than that propen&s;ity we have to &s;ympathize with others, and to receive by communication their inclinations and &s;enti|ments, however different from, or even contrary to our own. This is not only con&s;picuous in children, who implicitly em|brace every opinion propos'd to them; but al&s;o in men of the greate&s;t judgment and under&s;tanding, who find it very difficult to follow their own rea&s;on or inclination, in oppo&s;ition to that of their friends and daily companions. To this principle we ought to a&s;cribe the great uniformity we may ob&s;erve in the humours and turn of thinking of tho&s;e of the &s;ame nation; and 'tis much more probable, that this re&s;emblance ari&s;es from &s;ympathy, than from any influence of the &s;oil and climate, which, tho' they continue invariably the &s;ame, are not able to pre&s;erve the character of a nation the &s;ame for a century together. A good-natur'd man finds him&s;elf in an in&s;tant of the &s;ame hu|mour with his company; and even the proude&s;t and mo&s;t &s;urly take a tincture from their countrymen and acquaintance. A chearful countenance infu&s;es a &s;en&s;ible com|placency and &s;erenity into my mind; as an angry or &s;orrowful one throws a &s;udden damp upon me. Hatred, re&s;entment, e&s;|teem,
<PB N="74" REF="79">
love, courage, mirth and melancho|ly; all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions I feel more from com|munication than from my own natural tem|per and di&s;po&s;ition. So remarkable a phae|nomenon merits our attention, and mu&s;t be trac'd up to its fir&s;t principles.</P>
<P>WHEN any affection is infus'd by &s;ym|pathy, it is at fir&s;t known only by its ef|fects, and by tho&s;e external &s;igns in the countenance and conver&s;ation, which con|vey an idea of it. This idea is pre&s;ently converted into an impre&s;&s;ion, and acquires &s;uch a degree of force and vivacity, as to become the very pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, and produce an equal emotion, as any original affection. However in&s;tantaneous this change of the idea into an impre&s;&s;ion may be, it proceeds from certain views and reflections, which will not e&s;cape the &s;trict &s;crutiny of a philo&s;o|pher, tho' they may the per&s;on him&s;elf, who makes them.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that the idea, or rather impre&s;&s;ion of our&s;elves is always intimately pre&s;ent with us, and that our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s gives us &s;o lively a conception of our own per&s;on, that 'tis not po&s;&s;ible to imagine, that any thing can in this particular go be|yond it. Whatever object, therefore, is related to our&s;elves mu&s;t be conceived with
<PB N="75" REF="80">
a like vivacity of conception, according to the foregoing principles; and tho' this relation &s;hou'd not be &s;o &s;trong as that of cau&s;ation, it mu&s;t &s;till have a con&s;iderable influence. Re&s;emblance and contiguity are relations not to be neglected; e&s;pecially when by an inference from cau&s;e and effect, and by the ob&s;ervation of external &s;igns, we are in|form'd of the real exi&s;tence of the object, which is re&s;embling or contiguous.</P>
<P>NOW 'tis obvious, that nature has pre|&s;erv'd a great re&s;emblance among all human creatures, and that we never remark any pa&s;&s;ion or principle in others, of which, in &s;ome degree or other, we may not find a parallel in our&s;elves. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with the fabric of the mind, as with that of the body. However the parts may differ in &s;hape or &s;ize, their &s;tructure and compo&s;ition are in general the &s;ame. There is a very remarkable re&s;emblance, which pre&s;erves it&s;elf amid&s;t all their varie|ty; and this re&s;emblance mu&s;t very much contribute to make us enter into the &s;enti|ments of others, and embrace them with facility and plea&s;ure. Accordingly we find, that where, be&s;ide the general re&s;emblance of our natures, there is any peculiar &s;imi|larity in our manners, or character, or
<PB N="76" REF="81">
country, or language, it facilitates the &s;ym|pathy. The &s;tronger the relation is betwixt our&s;elves and any object, the more ea&s;ily does the imagination make the tran&s;ition, and convey to the related idea the vivacity of conception, with which we always form the idea of our own per&s;on.</P>
<P>NOR is re&s;emblance the only relation, which has this effect, but receives new force from other relations, that may accompany it. The &s;entiments of others have little influ|ence, when far remov'd from us, and re|quire the relation of contiguity, to make them communicate them&s;elves entirely. The relations of blood, being a &s;pecies of cau&s;ation, may &s;ometimes contribute to the &s;ame effect; as al&s;o acquaintance, which operates in the &s;ame manner with education and cu&s;tom; as we &s;hall &s;ee more fully <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Part II. Sect. 3.</NOTE> afterwards. All the&s;e rela|tions, when united together, convey the impre&s;&s;ion or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our own per|&s;on to the idea of the &s;entiments or pa&s;|&s;ions of others, and makes us conceive them in the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t lively manner.</P>
<P>IT has been remark'd in the beginning of this treati&s;e, that all ideas are borrow'd from impre&s;&s;ions, and that the&s;e two kinds
<PB N="77" REF="82">
of perceptions differ only in the degrees of force and vivacity, with which they &s;trike upon the &s;oul. The component parts of ideas and impre&s;&s;ions are preci&s;ely alike. The manner and order of their appearance may be the &s;ame. The different degrees of their force and vivacity are, therefore, the only particulars, that di&s;tingui&s;h them: And as this difference may be remov'd, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by a relation betwixt the impre&s;|&s;ions and ideas, 'tis no wonder an idea of a &s;entiment or pa&s;&s;ion, may by this means be &s;o inliven'd as to become the very &s;enti|ment or pa&s;&s;ion. The lively idea of any ob|ject always approaches its impre&s;&s;ion; and 'tis certain we may feel &s;ickne&s;s and pain from the mere force of imagination, and make a malady real by often thinking of it. But this is mo&s;t remarkable in the opi|nions and affections; and 'tis there princi|pally that a lively idea is converted into an impre&s;&s;ion. Our affections depend more upon our&s;elves, and the internal operations of the mind, than any other impre&s;&s;ions; for which rea&s;on they ari&s;e more naturally from the imagination, and from every lively idea we form of them. This is the nature and cau&s;e of &s;ympathy; and 'tis after this man|ner we enter &s;o deep into the opinions and
<PB N="78" REF="83">
affections of others, whenever we di&s;cover them.</P>
<P>WHAT is principally remarkable in this whole affair is the &s;trong confirmation the&s;e phaenomena give to the foregoing &s;y&s;tem concerning the under&s;tanding, and con&s;e|quently to the pre&s;ent one concerning the pa&s;&s;ions; &s;ince the&s;e are analogous to each other. 'Tis indeed evident, that when we &s;ympathize with the pa&s;&s;ions and &s;entiments of others, the&s;e movements appear at fir&s;t in <HI>our</HI> mind as mere ideas, and are conceiv'd to belong to another per&s;on, as we con|ceive any other matter of fact. 'Tis al&s;o evident, that the ideas of the affections of others are converted into the very impre&s;|&s;ions they repre&s;ent, and that the pa&s;&s;ions ari&s;e in conformity to the images we form of them. All this is an object of the plain|e&s;t experience, and depends not on any hy|pothe&s;is of philo&s;ophy. That &s;cience can only be admitted to explain the phaenomena; tho' at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, they are &s;o clear of them&s;elves, that there is but little occa&s;ion to employ it. For be|&s;ides the relation of cau&s;e and effect, by which we are convinc'd of the reality of the pa&s;&s;ion, with which we &s;ympathize; be&s;ides this, I &s;ay, we mu&s;t be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the rela|tions
<PB N="79" REF="84">
of re&s;emblance and contiguity, in or|der to feel the &s;ympathy in its full perfec|tion. And &s;ince the&s;e relations can entire|ly convert an idea into an impre&s;&s;ion, and convey the vivacity of the latter into the for|mer, &s;o perfectly as to lo&s;e nothing of it in the tran&s;ition, we may ea&s;ily conceive how the relation of cau&s;e and effect alone, may &s;erve to &s;trengthen and inliven an idea. In &s;ympathy there is an evident conver&s;ion of an idea into an impre&s;&s;ion. This conver&s;ion ari&s;es from the relation of objects to our&s;elf. Our&s;elf is always intimately pre&s;ent to us. Let us compare all the&s;e circum&s;tances, and we &s;hall find, that &s;ympathy is exactly corre&s;pon|dent to the operations of our under&s;tanding; and even contains &s;omething more &s;urpri&s;ing and extraordinary.</P>
<P>'TIS now time to turn our view from the general con&s;ideration of &s;ympathy, to its in|fluence on pride and humility, when the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions ari&s;e from prai&s;e and blame, from reputation and infamy. We may ob&s;erve, that no per&s;on is ever prais'd by another for any quality, which wou'd not, if real, produce, of it&s;elf, a pride in the per&s;on po&s;|&s;e&s;t of it. The elogiums either turn upon his power, or riches, or family, or virtue; all of which are &s;ubjects of vanity, that we have
<PB N="80" REF="85">
already explain'd and accounted for. 'Tis certain, then, that if a per&s;on con&s;ider'd him&s;elf in the &s;ame light, in which he ap|pears to his admirer, he wou'd fir&s;t receive a &s;eparate plea&s;ure, and afterwards a pride or &s;elf-&s;atisfaction, according to the hypo|the&s;is above explain'd. Now nothing is more natural than for us to embrace the opinions of others in this particular; both from <HI>&s;ym|pathy,</HI> which renders all their &s;entiments in|timately pre&s;ent to us; and from <HI>rea&s;oning,</HI> which makes us regard their judgment, as a kind of argument for what they affirm. The&s;e two principles of authority and &s;ym|pathy influence almo&s;t all our opinions; but mu&s;t have a peculiar influence, when we judge of our own worth and character. Such judgments are always attended with pa&s;|&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Book I. Part III. Sect. 10.</NOTE>; and nothing tends more to di&s;turb our under&s;tanding, and precipitate us into any opinions, however unrea&s;onable, than their connexion with pa&s;&s;ion; which dif|fu&s;es it&s;elf over the imagination, and gives an additional force to every related idea. To which we may add, that being con&s;cious of great partiality in our own favour, we are peculiarly pleas'd with any thing, that con|firms
<PB N="81" REF="86">
the good opinion we have of our&s;elves, and are ea&s;ily &s;hock'd with whatever oppo&s;es it.</P>
<P>ALL this appears very probable in theo|ry; but in order to be&s;tow a full certainty on this rea&s;oning, we mu&s;t examine the phaenomena of the pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ee if they agree with it.</P>
<P>AMONG the&s;e phaenomena we may e&s;|teem it a very favourable one to our pre|&s;ent purpo&s;e, that tho' fame in general be agreeable, yet we receive a much greater &s;a|tisfaction from the approbation of tho&s;e, whom we our&s;elves e&s;teem and approve of, than of tho&s;e, whom we hate and de&s;pi&s;e. In like manner we are principally mortify'd with the contempt of per&s;ons, upon who&s;e judgment we &s;et &s;ome value, and are, in a great mea&s;ure, indifferent about the opinions of the re&s;t of mankind. But if the mind receiv'd from any original in&s;tinct a de&s;ire of fame, and aver&s;ion to infamy, fame and in|famy wou'd influence us without di&s;tinc|tion; and every opinion, according as it were favourable or unfavourable, wou'd e|qually excite that de&s;ire or aver&s;ion. The judgment of a fool is the judgment of ano|ther per&s;on, as well as that of a wi&s;e man, and is only inferior in its influence on our own judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="87">
WE are not only better pleas'd with the approbation of a wi&s;e man than with that of a fool, but receive an additional &s;atis|faction from the former, when 'tis obtain'd after a long and intimate acquaintance. This is accounted for after the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>THE prai&s;es of others never give us much plea&s;ure, unle&s;s they concur with our own opinion, and extol us for tho&s;e quali|ties, in which we chiefly excel. A mere &s;oldier little values the character of eloquence: A gownman of courage: A bi&s;hop of hu|mour: Or a merchant of learning. What|ever e&s;teem a man may have for any quali|ty, ab&s;tractedly con&s;ider'd; when he is con|&s;cious he is not po&s;&s;e&s;t of it; the opini|ons of the whole world will give him lit|tle plea&s;ure in that particular, and that be|cau&s;e they never will be able to draw his own opinion after them.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more u&s;ual than for men of good families, but narrow circum&s;tances, to leave their friends and country, and ra|ther &s;eek their livelihood by mean and me|chanical employments among &s;trangers, than among tho&s;e, who are acquainted with their birth and education. We &s;hall be unknown, &s;ay they, where we go. No body will &s;u&s;pect from what family we are &s;prung. We
<PB N="83" REF="88">
&s;hall be remov'd from all our friends and acquaintance, and our poverty and mean|ne&s;s will by that means &s;it more ea&s;y upon us. In examining the&s;e &s;entiments, I find they afford many very convincing arguments for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>FIRST, We may infer from them, that the unea&s;ine&s;s of being contemn'd depends on &s;ym|pathy, and that &s;ympathy depends on the rela|tion of objects to our&s;elves; &s;ince we are mo&s;t unea&s;y under the contempt of per&s;ons, who are both related to us by blood, and conti|guous in place. Hence we &s;eek to dimi|ni&s;h this &s;ympathy and unea&s;ine&s;s by &s;epa|rating the&s;e relations, and placing our&s;elves in a contiguity to &s;trangers, and at a di&s;|tance from relations.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, We may conclude, that relations are requi&s;ite to &s;ympathy, not ab|&s;olutely con&s;ider'd as relations, but by their influence in converting our ideas of the &s;en|timents of others into the very &s;entiments, by means of the a&s;&s;ociation betwixt the idea of their per&s;ons, and that of our own. For here the relations of kindred and contiguity both &s;ub&s;i&s;t; but not being united in the &s;ame per&s;ons, they contribute in a le&s;s de|gree to the &s;ympathy.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="89">
THIRDLY, This very circum&s;tance of the diminution of &s;ympathy by the &s;epara|tion of relations is worthy of our attention. Suppo&s;e I am plac'd in a poor condition among &s;trangers, and con&s;equently am but lightly treated; I yet find my&s;elf ea&s;ier in that &s;ituation, than when I was every day expos'd to the contempt of my kindred and countrymen. Here I feel a double con|tempt; from my relations, but they are ab&s;ent; from tho&s;e about me, but they are &s;trangers. This double contempt is like|wi&s;e &s;trengthen'd by the two relations of kindred and contiguity. But as the per|&s;ons are not the &s;ame, who are connected with me by tho&s;e two relations, this dif|ference of ideas &s;eparates the impre&s;&s;ions ari&s;ing from the contempt, and keeps them from running into each other. The con|tempt of my neighbours has a certain in|fluence; as has al&s;o that of my kindred: But the&s;e influences are di&s;tinct, and never unite; as when the contempt proceeds from per&s;ons who are at once both my neigh|bours and kindred. This phaenomenon is analogous to the &s;y&s;tem of pride and hu|mility above-explain'd, which may &s;eem &s;o extraordinary to vulgar apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="90">
FOURTHLY, A per&s;on in the&s;e circum|&s;tances naturally conceals his birth from tho&s;e among whom he lives, and is very unea&s;y, if any one &s;u&s;pects him to be of a family, much &s;uperior to his pre&s;ent for|tune and way of living. Every thing in this world is judg'd of by compari&s;on. What is an immen&s;e fortune for a private gentle|man is beggary for a prince. A pea&s;ant wou'd think him&s;elf happy in what cannot afford nece&s;&s;aries for a gentleman. When a man has either been acu&s;tom'd to a more &s;plendid way of living, or thinks him&s;elf intitled to it by his birth and quality, every thing below is di&s;agreeable and even &s;hame|ful; and 'tis with the greate&s;t indu&s;try he conceals his preten&s;ions to a better fortune. Here he him&s;elf knows his misfortunes; but as tho&s;e, with whom he lives, are ig|norant of them, he has the di&s;agreeable reflection and compari&s;on &s;ugge&s;ted only by his own thoughts, and never receives it by a &s;ympathy with others; which mu&s;t con|tribute very much to his ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>IF there be any objections to this hypo|the&s;is, <HI>that the plea&s;ure, which we receive from prai&s;e, ari&s;es from a communication of &s;entiments,</HI> we &s;hall find, upon examination, that the&s;e objections, when taken in a pro|per
<PB N="86" REF="91">
light, will &s;erve to confirm it. Popular fame may be agreeable even to a man, who de&s;pi&s;es the vulgar; but 'tis becau&s;e their multitude gives them additional weight and authority. Plagiaries are delighted with prai&s;es, which they are con&s;cious they do not de&s;erve; but this is a kind of ca&s;tle|building, where the imagination amu&s;es it|&s;elf with its own fictions, and &s;trives to render them firm and &s;table by a &s;ympathy with the &s;entiments of others. Proud men are mo&s;t &s;hock'd with contempt, tho' they do not mo&s;t readily a&s;&s;ent to it; but 'tis be|cau&s;e of the oppo&s;ition betwixt the pa&s;&s;ion, which is natural to them, and that receiv'd by &s;ympathy. A violent lover in like man|ner is very much di&s;pleas'd when you blame and condemn his love; tho' 'tis evident your oppo&s;ition can have no influence, but by the hold it takes of him&s;elf, and by his &s;ympathy with you. If he de&s;pi&s;es you, or perceives you are in je&s;t, whatever you &s;ay has no effect upon him.</P>

<P>THUS in whatever light we con&s;ider this &s;ubject, we may &s;till ob&s;erve, that the cau&s;es of pride and humility corre|&s;pond exactly to our hypothe&s;is, and that nothing can excite either of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, unle&s;s it be both related to our&s;elves, and produces a plea&s;ure or pain independent of the pa&s;&s;ion. We have not only prov'd, that a tendency to produce plea&s;ure or pain is com|mon to all the cau&s;es of pride or humility, but al&s;o that 'tis the only thing, which is common; and con&s;equently is the quality, by which they operate. We have farther prov'd, that the mo&s;t con&s;iderable cau&s;es of the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions are really nothing but the power of producing either agreeable or unea&s;y &s;en&s;a|tions; and therefore that all their effects, and among&s;t the re&s;t, pride and humility, are deriv'd &s;olely from that origin.

<P>'TIS u&s;ual with anatomi&s;ts to join their ob&s;ervations and experiments on human bo|dies to tho&s;e on bea&s;ts, and from the agree|ment of the&s;e experiments to derive an ad|ditional argument for any particular hypo|the&s;is. 'Tis indeed certain, that where the &s;tructure of parts in brutes is the &s;ame as in men, and the operation of the&s;e parts al&s;o the &s;ame, the cau&s;es of that operation cannot be different, and that whatever we di&s;cover to be true of the one &s;pecies, may be concluded without he&s;itation to be cer|tain of the other. Thus tho' the mixture of humours and the compo&s;ition of mi|nute parts may ju&s;tly be pre&s;um'd to be &s;omewhat different in men from what it is in mere animals; and therefore any expe|riment we make upon the one concerning the effects of medicines will not always apply to the other; yet as the &s;tructure of the veins and mu&s;cles, the fabric and &s;ituation of the heart, of the lungs, the &s;tomach, the liver and other parts, are the &s;ame or nearly the &s;ame in all animals, the very &s;ame hypothe|&s;is, which in one &s;pecies explains mu&s;cular mo|tion, the progre&s;s of the chyle, the circula|tion of the blood, mu&s;t be applicable to e|very
<PB N="89" REF="94">
one; and according as it agrees or di&s;|agrees with the experiments we may make in any &s;pecies of creatures, we may draw a proof of its truth or fal&s;hood on the whole. Let us, therefore, apply this method of en|quiry, which is found &s;o ju&s;t and u&s;eful in rea&s;onings concerning the body, to our pre&s;ent anatomy of the mind, and &s;ee what di&s;coveries we can make by it.</P>
<P>IN order to this we mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;hew the corre&s;pondence of <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> in men and ani|mals, and afterwards compare the <HI>cau&s;es,</HI> which produce the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>'TIS plain, that almo&s;t in every &s;pecies of creatures, but e&s;pecially of the nobler kind, there are many evident marks of pride and humility. The very port and gait of a &s;wan, or turkey, or peacock &s;how the high idea he has entertain'd of him&s;elf, and his contempt of all others. This is the more remarkable, that in the two la&s;t &s;pecies of animals, the pride always attends the beauty, and is di&s;cover'd in the male only. The vanity and emulation of nightingales in &s;ing|ing have been commonly remark'd; as like|wi&s;e that of hor&s;es in &s;wiftne&s;s, of hounds in &s;agacity and &s;mell, of the bull and cock in &s;trength, and of every other animal in
<PB N="90" REF="95">
his particular excellency. Add to this, that every &s;pecies of creatures, which approach &s;o often to man, as to familiarize them&s;elves with him, &s;how an evident pride in his ap|probation, and are pleas'd with his prai&s;es and care&s;&s;es, independent of every other con|&s;ideration. Nor are they the care&s;&s;es of eve|ry one without di&s;tinction, which give them this vanity, but tho&s;e principally of the per&s;ons they know and love; in the &s;ame manner as that pa&s;&s;ion is excited in man|kind. All the&s;e are evident proofs, that pride and humility are not merely human pa&s;&s;ions, but extend them&s;elves over the whole animal creation.</P>
<P>THE <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are likewi&s;e much the &s;ame in bea&s;ts as in us, making a ju&s;t allowance for our &s;uperior knowledge and under&s;tanding. Thus animals have little or no &s;en&s;e of virtue or vice; they quickly lo&s;e &s;ight of the relations of blood; and are incapable of that of right and property: For which rea&s;on the cau&s;es of their pride and humility mu&s;t lie &s;olely in the body, and can never be plac'd either in the mind or external objects. But &s;o far as regards the body, the &s;ame qualities cau&s;e pride in the animal as in the human kind; and 'tis on beauty, &s;trength, &s;wiftne&s;s or &s;ome other
<PB N="91" REF="96">
u&s;eful or agreeable quality that this pa&s;&s;ion is always founded.</P>
<P>THE next que&s;tion is, whether, &s;ince tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are the &s;ame, and ari&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;es thro' the whole creation, the <HI>manner,</HI> in which the cau&s;es operate, be al&s;o the &s;ame. According to all rules of analogy, this is ju&s;tly to be expected; and if we find upon trial, that the explication of the&s;e phaenomena, which we make u&s;e of in one &s;pecies, will not apply to the re&s;t, we may pre&s;ume that that explication, how|ever &s;pecious, is in reality without foun|dation.</P>
<P>IN order to decide this que&s;tion, let us con&s;ider, that there is evidently the &s;ame <HI>relation</HI> of ideas, and deriv'd from the &s;ame cau&s;es, in the minds of animals as in tho&s;e of men. A dog, that has hid a bone, often forgets the place; but when brought to it, his thought pa&s;&s;es ea&s;ily to what he formerly conceal'd, by means of the contiguity, which produces a relation among his ideas. In like manner, when he has been heartily beat in any place, he will tremble on his ap|proach to it, even tho' he di&s;cover no &s;igns of any pre&s;ent danger. The effects of re|&s;emblance are not &s;o remarkable; but as that
<PB N="92" REF="97">
relation makes a con&s;iderable ingredient in cau&s;ation, of which all animals &s;hew &s;o evi|dent a judgment, we may conclude that the three relations of re&s;emblance, contiguity and cau&s;ation operate in the &s;ame manner upon bea&s;ts as upon human creatures.</P>
<P>THERE are al&s;o in&s;tances of the relation of impre&s;&s;ions, &s;ufficient to convince us, that there is an union of certain affections with each other in the inferior &s;pecies of crea|tures as well as in the &s;uperior, and that their minds are frequently convey'd thro' a &s;eries of connected emotions. A dog, when elevated with joy, runs naturally into love and kindne&s;s, whether of his ma&s;ter or of the &s;ex. In like manner, when full of pain and &s;orrow, he becomes quarrel&s;ome and ill-natur'd; and that pa&s;&s;ion, which at fir&s;t was grief, is by the &s;malle&s;t occa&s;ion con|verted into anger.</P>
<P>THUS all the internal principles, that are nece&s;&s;ary in us to produce either pride or humility, are common to all crea|tures; and &s;ince the cau&s;es, which excite the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, are likewi&s;e the &s;ame, we may ju&s;tly conclude, that the&s;e cau&s;es ope|rate after the &s;ame <HI>manner</HI> thro' the whole animal creation. My hypothe&s;is is &s;o &s;imple,
<PB N="93" REF="98">
and &s;uppo&s;es &s;o little reflection and judge|ment, that 'tis applicable to every &s;en&s;ible creature; which mu&s;t not only be allow'd to be a convincing proof of its veracity, but, I am confident, will be found an ob|jection to every other &s;y&s;tem.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I. <HI>Of the object and cau&s;es of love and hatred.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_TIS altogether impo&s;&s;ible to give any definition of the pa&s;&s;ions of <HI>love</HI> and <HI>hatred;</HI> and that becau&s;e they produce merely a &s;imple impre&s;|&s;ion, without any mixture or compo&s;ition. 'Twou'd be as unnece&s;&s;ary to attempt any de&s;cription of them, drawn from their na|ture, origin, cau&s;es and objects; and that both becau&s;e the&s;e are the &s;ubjects of our pre|&s;ent enquiry, and becau&s;e the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of them&s;elves are &s;ufficiently known from our common feeling and experience. This we have already ob&s;erv'd concerning pride and
<PB N="96" REF="100">
humility, and here repeat it concerning love and hatred; and indeed there is &s;o great a re&s;emblance betwixt the&s;e two &s;ets of pa&s;|&s;ions, that we &s;hall be oblig'd to begin with a kind of abridgment of our rea&s;onings concerning the former, in order to explain the latter.</P>
<P>As the immediate <HI>object</HI> of pride and humility is &s;elf or that identical per&s;on, of who&s;e thoughts, actions, and &s;en&s;ations we are intimately con&s;cious; &s;o the <HI>object</HI> of love and hatred is &s;ome other per&s;on, of who&s;e thoughts, actions, and &s;en&s;ations we are not con&s;cious. This is &s;ufficient|ly evident from experience. Our love and hatred are always directed to &s;ome &s;en&s;i|ble being external to us; and when we talk of <HI>&s;elf-love,</HI> 'tis not in a proper &s;en&s;e, nor has the &s;en&s;ation it produces any thing in common with that tender emotion, which is excited by a friend or mi&s;tre&s;s. 'Tis the &s;ame ca&s;e with hatred. We may be mor|tified by our own faults and follies; but never feel any anger or hatred, except from the injuries of others.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the object of love and hatred be always &s;ome other per&s;on, 'tis plain that the object is not, properly &s;peaking, the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, or alone &s;ufficient to
<PB N="97" REF="101">
excite them. For &s;ince love and hatred are directly contrary in their &s;en&s;ation, and have the &s;ame object in common, if that object were al&s;o their cau&s;e, it wou'd pro|duce the&s;e oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions in an equal de|gree; and as they mu&s;t, from the very fir&s;t moment, de&s;troy each other, none of them wou'd ever be able to make its appearance. There mu&s;t, therefore, be &s;ome cau&s;e diffe|rent from the object.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the cau&s;es of love and hatred, we &s;hall find they are very much diver&s;ify'd, and have not many things in common. The virtue, knowledge, wit, good &s;en&s;e, good humour of any per&s;on, produce love and e&s;teem; as the oppo&s;ite qualities, hatred and contempt. The &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions ari&s;e from bodily accompli&s;hments, &s;uch as beauty, force, &s;wiftne&s;s, dexteri|ty; and from their contraries; as likewi&s;e from the external advantages and di&s;ad|vantages of family, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, cloaths, na|tion and climate. There is not one of the&s;e objects, but what by its different qualities may produce love and e&s;teem, or hatred and contempt.</P>
<P>FROM the view of the&s;e cau&s;es we may derive a new di&s;tinction betwixt the <HI>quality</HI> that operates, and the <HI>&s;ubject</HI> on which it
<PB N="98" REF="102">
is plac'd. A prince, that is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a &s;tately palace, commands the e&s;teem of the people upon that account; and that <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> by the beauty of the palace, and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> by the relation of property, which connects it with him. The removal of either of the&s;e de|&s;troys the pa&s;&s;ion; which evidently proves that the cau&s;e is a compounded one.</P>
<P>'TWOU'D be tedious to trace the pa&s;&s;ions of love and hatred, thro' all the ob&s;ervations which we have form'd concerning pride and humility, and which are equally applicable to both &s;ets of pa&s;&s;ions. 'Twill be &s;ufficient to <HI>remark</HI> in general, that the object of love and hatred is evidently &s;ome thinking per&s;on; and that the &s;en&s;ation of the former pa&s;&s;ion is always agreeable, and of the latter un|ea&s;y. We may al&s;o <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> with &s;ome &s;hew of probability, <HI>that the cau&s;e of both the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions is always related to a thinking being,</HI> and <HI>that the cau&s;e of the former pro|duce a &s;eparate plea&s;ure, and of the latter a &s;eparate unea&s;ine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>ONE of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, <HI>viz.</HI> that the cau&s;e of love and hatred mu&s;t be related to a per&s;on or thinking being, in order to produce the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, is not only probable, but too evident to be conte&s;ted. Virtue and vice, when con&s;ider'd in the ab&s;tract; beauty
<PB N="99" REF="103">
and deformity, when plac'd on inanimate objects; poverty and riches, when belong|ing to a third per&s;on, excite no degree of love or hatred, e&s;teem or contempt to|wards tho&s;e, who have no relation to them. A per&s;on looking out at a window, &s;ees me in the &s;treet, and beyond me a beautiful palace, with which I have no concern: I believe none will pretend, that this per&s;on will pay me the &s;ame re&s;pect, as if I were owner of the palace.</P>
<P>'TIS not &s;o evident at fir&s;t &s;ight, that a rela|tion of impre&s;&s;ions is requi&s;ite to the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, and that becau&s;e in the tran&s;ition the one im|pre&s;&s;ion is &s;o much confounded with the other, that they become in a manner undi&s;tingui&s;hable. But as in pride and humility, we have ea&s;i|ly been able to make the &s;eparation, and to prove, that every cau&s;e of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions pro|duces a &s;eparate pain or plea&s;ure, I might here ob&s;erve the &s;ame method with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, in examining particularly the &s;eve|ral cau&s;es of love and hatred. But as I ha|&s;ten to a full and deci&s;ive proof of the&s;e &s;y|&s;tems, I delay this examination for a mo|ment: And in the mean time &s;hall endea|vour to convert to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e all my rea&s;onings concerning pride and humi|lity,
<PB N="100" REF="104">
by an argument that is founded on un|que&s;tionable experience.</P>
<P>THERE are few per&s;ons, that are &s;atis|fy'd with their own character, or genius, or fortune, who are not de&s;irous of &s;hewing them&s;elves to the world, and of acquiring the love and approbation of mankind. Now 'tis evident, that the very &s;ame qualities and circum&s;tances, which are the cau&s;es of pride or &s;elf-e&s;teem, are al&s;o the cau&s;es of va|nity or the de&s;ire of reputation; and that we always put to view tho&s;e particulars with which in our&s;elves we are be&s;t &s;atisfy'd. But if love and e&s;teem were not produc'd by the &s;ame qualities as pride, according as the&s;e qualities are related to our&s;elves or o|thers, this method of proceeding wou'd be very ab&s;urd, nor cou'd men expect a cor|re&s;pondence in the &s;entiments of every o|ther per&s;on, with tho&s;e them&s;elves have en|tertain'd. 'Tis true, few can form exact &s;y&s;tems of the pa&s;&s;ions, or make reflections on their general nature and re&s;emblances. But without &s;uch a progre&s;s in philo&s;ophy, we are not &s;ubject to many mi&s;takes in this particular, but are &s;ufficiently guided by common experience, as well as by a kind of <HI>pre&s;en&s;ation;</HI> which tells us what will o|perate on others, by what we feel immedi|ately
<PB N="101" REF="105">
in our&s;elves. Since then the &s;ame qualities that produce pride or humility, cau&s;e love or hatred; all the arguments that have been employ'd to prove, that the cau&s;es of the former pa&s;&s;ions excite a pain or plea&s;ure independent of the pa&s;&s;ion, will be applicable with equal evidence to the cau&s;es of the latter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II. <HI>Experiments to confirm this &s;y&s;tem.</HI></HEAD>
<P>UPON duly weighing the&s;e argu|ments, no one will make any &s;cru|ple to a&s;&s;ent to that conclu&s;ion I draw from them, concerning the tran&s;ition along rela|ted impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, e&s;pecially as 'tis a principle, in it&s;elf, &s;o ea&s;y and natural. But that we may place this &s;y&s;tem beyond doubt both with regard to love and hatred, pride and humility, 'twill be proper to make &s;ome new experiments upon all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, as well as to recal a few of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, which I have formerly touch'd upon.</P>
<P>IN order to make the&s;e experiments, let us &s;uppo&s;e I am in company with a per&s;on, whom I formerly regarded without any &s;en|timents
<PB N="102" REF="106">
either of friend&s;hip or enmity. Here I have the natural and ultimate object of all the&s;e four pa&s;&s;ions plac'd before me. My|&s;elf am the proper object of pride or humi|lity; the other per&s;on of love or hatred.</P>
<P>REGARD now with attention the nature of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, and their &s;ituation with re&s;pect to each other. 'Tis evident here are four affections, plac'd, as it were, in a &s;quare or regular connexion with, and di|&s;tance from each other. The pa&s;&s;ions of pride and humility, as well as tho&s;e of love and hatred, are connected together by the identity of their object, which to the fir&s;t &s;et of pa&s;&s;ions is &s;elf, to the &s;econd &s;ome other per&s;on. The&s;e two lines of com|munication or connexion form two oppo|&s;ite &s;ides of the &s;quare. Again, pride and love are agreeable pa&s;&s;ions; hatred and hu|mility unea&s;y. This &s;imilitude of &s;en&s;ation betwixt pride and love, and that betwixt humility and hatred form a new connexion, and may be con&s;ider'd as the other two &s;ides of the &s;quare. Upon the whole, pride is connected with humility, love with ha|tred, by their objects or ideas: Pride with love, humility with hatred, by their &s;en&s;a|tions or impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="107">
I SAY then, that nothing can produce any of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions without bearing it a double relation, <HI>viz.</HI> of ideas to the object of the pa&s;&s;ion, and of &s;en&s;ation to the pa&s;|&s;ion it&s;elf. This we mu&s;t prove by our ex|periments.</P>
<P>FIRST EXPERIMENT. To proceed with the greater order in the&s;e experiments, let us fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that being plac'd in the &s;i|tuation above-mention'd, <HI>viz.</HI> in company with &s;ome other per&s;on, there is an object pre&s;ented, that has no relation either of impre&s;&s;ions or ideas to any of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. Thus &s;uppo&s;e we regard together an ordi|nary &s;tone, or other common object, be|longing to neither of us, and cau&s;ing of it|&s;elf no emotion, or independent pain and plea&s;ure: 'Tis evident &s;uch an object will produce none of the&s;e four pa&s;&s;ions. Let us try it upon each of them &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. Let us apply it to love, to hatred, to humi|lity, to pride; none of them ever ari&s;es in the &s;malle&s;t degree imaginable. Let us change the object, as oft as we plea&s;e; pro|vided &s;till we choo&s;e one, that has neither of the&s;e two relations. Let us repeat the experiment in all the di&s;po&s;itions, of which the mind is &s;u&s;ceptible. No object, in the va&s;t variety of nature, will, in any di&s;po&s;i|tion,
<PB N="104" REF="108">
produce any pa&s;&s;ion without the&s;e re|lations.</P>
<P>SECOND EXPERIMENT. Since an ob|ject, that wants both the&s;e relations can ever produce any pa&s;&s;ion, let us be&s;tow on it only one of the&s;e relations; and &s;ee what will follow. Thus &s;uppo&s;e, I regard a &s;tone or any common object, that belongs either to me or my companion, and by that means acquires a relation of ideas to the ob|ject of the pa&s;&s;ions: 'Tis plain, that to con|&s;ider the matter <HI>a priori,</HI> no emotion of any kind can rea&s;onably be expected. For be|&s;ides, that a relation of ideas operates &s;e|cretly and calmly on the mind, it be&s;tows an equal impul&s;e towards the oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions of pride and humility, love and hatred, accord|ing as the object belongs to our&s;elves or o|thers; which oppo&s;ition of the pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t de&s;troy both, and leave the mind per|fectly free from any affection or emotion. This rea&s;oning <HI>a priori</HI> is confirm'd by ex|perience. No trivial or vulgar object, that cau&s;es not a pain or plea&s;ure, independent of the pa&s;&s;ion, will ever, by its property or other relations, either to our&s;elves or o|thers, be able to produce the affections of pride or humility, love or hatred.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="109">
THIRD EXPERIMENT. 'Tis evident, therefore, that a relation of ideas is not a|ble alone to give ri&s;e to the&s;e affections. Let us now remove this relation, and in its &s;tead place a relation of impre&s;&s;ions, by pre|&s;enting an object, which is agreeable or di&s;|agreeable, but has no relation either to our|&s;elf or companion; and let us ob&s;erve the con&s;equences. To con&s;ider the matter fir&s;t <HI>a priori,</HI> as in the preceding experiment; we may conclude, that the object will have a &s;mall, but an uncertain connexion with the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. For be&s;ides, that this relation is not a cold and imperceptible one, it has not the inconvenience of the relation of ideas, nor directs us with equal force to two contrary pa&s;&s;ions, which by their oppo|&s;ition de&s;troy each other. But if we con|&s;ider, on the other hand, that this tran&s;ition from the &s;en&s;ation to the affection is not forwarded by any principle, that produces a tran&s;ition of ideas; but, on the contrary, that tho' the one impre&s;&s;ion be ea&s;ily transfus'd into the other, yet the change of objects is &s;uppos'd contrary to all the principles, that cau&s;e a tran&s;ition of that kind; we may from thence infer, that nothing will ever be a &s;teady or durable cau&s;e of any pa&s;&s;ion, that is connected with the pa&s;&s;ion merely by a
<PB N="106" REF="110">
relation of impre&s;&s;ions. What our rea&s;on wou'd conclude from analogy, after bal|lancing the&s;e arguments, wou'd be, that an object, which produces plea&s;ure or un|ea&s;ine&s;s, but has no manner of connexion either with our&s;elves or others, may give &s;uch a turn to the di&s;po&s;ition, as that it may naturally fall into pride or love, humility or hatred, and &s;earch for other objects, up|on which, by a double relation, it can found the&s;e affections; but that an object, which has only one of the&s;e relations, tho' the mo&s;t advantageous one, can never give ri&s;e to any con&s;tant and e&s;tabli&s;h'd pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>MOST fortunately all this rea&s;oning is found to be exactly conformable to expe|rience, and the phaenomena of the pa&s;&s;ions. Suppo&s;e I were travelling with a compa|nion thro' a country, to which we are both utter &s;trangers; 'tis evident, that if the pro|&s;pects be beautiful, the roads agreeable, and the inns commodious, this may put me in|to good humour both with my&s;elf and fel|low-traveller. But as we &s;uppo&s;e, that this country has no relation either to my&s;elf or friend, it can never be the immediate cau&s;e of pride or love; and therefore if I found not the pa&s;&s;ion on &s;ome other object, that bears either of us a clo&s;er relation, my emotions
<PB N="107" REF="111">
are rather to be con&s;ider'd as the overflow|ings of an elevate or humane di&s;po&s;ition, than as an e&s;tabli&s;h'd pa&s;&s;ion. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame where the object produces unea&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>FOURTH EXPERIMENT. Having found, that neither an object without any relation of ideas or impre&s;&s;ions, nor an object, that has only one relation, can ever cau&s;e pride or humility, love or hatred; rea&s;on alone may convince us, without any farther ex|periment, that whatever has a double rela|tion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily excite the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions; &s;ince 'tis evident they mu&s;t have &s;ome cau&s;e. But to leave as little room for doubt as po&s;|&s;ible, let us renew our experiments, and &s;ee whether the event in this ca&s;e an&s;wers our expectation. I choo&s;e an object, &s;uch as virtue, that cau&s;es a &s;eparate &s;atisfaction: On this object I be&s;tow a relation to &s;elf; and find, that from this di&s;po&s;ition of af|fairs, there immediately ari&s;es a pa&s;&s;ion. But what pa&s;&s;ion? That very one of pride, to which this object bears a double relation. Its idea is related to that of &s;elf, the object of the pa&s;&s;ion: The &s;en&s;ation it cau&s;es re|&s;embles the &s;en&s;ation of the pa&s;&s;ion. That I may be &s;ure I am not mi&s;taken in this experiment, I remove fir&s;t one relation; then
<PB N="108" REF="112">
another; and find, that each removal de|&s;troys the pa&s;&s;ion, and leaves the object per|fectly indifferent. But I am not content with this. I make a &s;till farther trial; and in&s;tead of removing the relation, I only change it for one of a different kind. I &s;uppo&s;e the virtue to belong to my compa|nion, not to my&s;elf; and ob&s;erve what fol|lows from this alteration. I immediately perceive the affections wheel about, and leav|ing pride, where there is only one relation, <HI>viz.</HI> of impre&s;&s;ions, fall to the &s;ide of love, where they are attracted by a double rela|tion of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas. By repeating the &s;ame experiment, in changing anew the relation of ideas, I bring the affections back to pride; and by a new repetition I again place them at love or kindne&s;s. Being fully convinc'd of the influence of this relation, I try the effects of the other; and by chang|ing virtue for vice, convert the plea&s;ant im|pre&s;&s;ion, which ari&s;es from the former, into the di&s;agreeable one, which proceeds from the latter. The effect &s;till an&s;wers expec|tation. Vice, when plac'd on another, ex|cites, by means of its double relations, the pa&s;&s;ion of hatred, in&s;tead of love, which for the &s;ame rea&s;on ari&s;es from virtue. To conti|nue the experiment, I change anew the relation
<PB N="109" REF="113">
of ideas, and &s;uppo&s;e the vice to belong to my&s;elf. What follows? What is u&s;ual. A &s;ub&s;equent change of the pa&s;&s;ion from ha|tred to humility. This humility I convert into pride by a new change of the impre&s;|&s;ion; and find after all that I have com|pleated the round, and have by the&s;e changes brought back the pa&s;&s;ion to that very &s;ituation, in which I fir&s;t found it.</P>
<P>BUT to make the matter &s;till more cer|tain, I alter the object; and in&s;tead of vice and virtue, make the trial upon beauty and deformity, riches and poverty, power and &s;ervitude. Each of the&s;e objects runs the circle of the pa&s;&s;ions in the &s;ame manner, by a change of their relations: And in what|ever order we proceed, whether thro' pride, love, hatred, humility, or thro' humility, hatred, love, pride, the experiment is not in the lea&s;t diver&s;ify'd. E&s;teem and con|tempt, indeed, ari&s;e on &s;ome occa&s;ions in|&s;tead of love and hatred; but the&s;e are at the bottom the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, only diver|&s;ify'd by &s;ome cau&s;es, which we &s;hall ex|plain afterwards.</P>
<P>FIFTH EXPERIMENT. To give greater authority to the&s;e experiments, let us change the &s;ituation of affairs as much as po&s;&s;ible, and place the pa&s;&s;ions and objects in all the
<PB N="110" REF="114">
different po&s;itions, of which they are &s;u&s;|ceptible. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, be&s;ide the relations above-mention'd, that the per&s;on, along with whom I make all the&s;e experiments, is clo&s;ely connected with me either by blood or friend|&s;hip. He is, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, my &s;on or brother, or is united to me by a long and familiar acquaintance. Let us next &s;uppo&s;e, that the cau&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ion acquires a double relation of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas to this per&s;on; and let us &s;ee what the ef|fects are of all the&s;e complicated attractions and relations.</P>
<P>BEFORE we con&s;ider what they are in fact, let us determine what they ought to be, conformable to my hypothe&s;is. 'Tis plain, that, according as the impre&s;&s;ion is either plea&s;ant or unea&s;y, the pa&s;&s;ion of love or hatred mu&s;t ari&s;e towards the per&s;on, who is thus connected to the cau&s;e of the im|pre&s;&s;ion by the&s;e double relations, which I have all along requir'd. The virtue of a brother mu&s;t make me love him; as his vice or infamy mu&s;t excite the contrary pa&s;|&s;ion. But to judge only from the &s;ituation of affairs, I &s;hou'd not expect, that the af|fections wou'd re&s;t there, and never tran&s;|fu&s;e them&s;elves into any other impre&s;&s;ion. As there is here a per&s;on, who by means of
<PB N="111" REF="115">
a double relation is the object of my pa&s;|&s;ion, the very &s;ame rea&s;oning leads me to think the pa&s;&s;ion will be carry'd farther. The per&s;on has a relation of ideas to my|&s;elf, according to the &s;uppo&s;ition; the pa&s;|&s;ion, of which he is the object, by be|ing either agreeable or unea&s;y, has a rela|tion of impre&s;&s;ions to pride or humility. 'Tis evident, then, that one of the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions mu&s;t ari&s;e from the love or ha|tred.</P>
<P>THIS is the rea&s;oning I form in confor|mity to my hypothe&s;is; and am pleas'd to find upon trial that every thing an&s;wers ex|actly to my expectation. The virtue or vice of a &s;on or brother not only excites love or hatred, but by a new tran&s;ition, from &s;imi|lar cau&s;es, gives ri&s;e to pride or humility. Nothing cau&s;es greater vanity than any &s;hin|ing quality in our relations; as nothing mor|tifies us more than their vice or infamy. This exact conformity of experience to our rea&s;oning is a convincing proof of the &s;o|lidity of that hypothe&s;is, upon which we rea&s;on.</P>
<P>SIXTH EXPERIMENT. This evidence will be &s;till augmented, if we rever&s;e the experiment, and pre&s;erving &s;till the &s;ame re|lations, begin only with a different pa&s;|&s;ion.
<PB N="112" REF="116">
Suppo&s;e, that in&s;tead of the virtue or vice of a &s;on or brother, which cau&s;es fir&s;t love or hatred, and afterwards pride or hu|mility, we place the&s;e good or bad qualities on our&s;elves, without any immediate con|nexion with the per&s;on, who is related to us: Experience &s;hews us, that by this change of &s;ituation the whole chain is broke, and that the mind is not convey'd from one pa&s;|&s;ion to another, as in the preceding in&s;tance. We never love or hate a &s;on or brother for the virtue or vice we di&s;cern in our&s;elves; tho' 'tis evident the &s;ame qualities in him give us a very &s;en&s;ible pride or humility. The tran&s;ition from pride or humility to love or hatred is not &s;o natural as from love or hatred to pride or humility. This may at fir&s;t &s;ight be e&s;teem'd contrary to my hy|pothe&s;is; &s;ince the relations of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas are in both ca&s;es preci&s;ely the &s;ame. Pride and humility are impre&s;&s;ions related to love and hatred. My&s;elf am re|lated to the per&s;on. It &s;hou'd, therefore, be expected, that like cau&s;es mu&s;t produce like effects, and a perfect tran&s;ition ari&s;e from the double relation, as in all other ca&s;es. This difficulty we may ea&s;ily &s;olve by the following reflections.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="117">
'TIS evident, that as we are at all times intimately con&s;cious of our&s;elves, our &s;enti|ments and pa&s;&s;ions, their ideas mu&s;t &s;trike upon us with greater vivacity than the ideas of the &s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions of any other per&s;on. But every thing, that &s;trikes upon us with vivacity, and appears in a full and &s;trong light, forces it&s;elf, in a manner, into our con&s;ideration, and becomes pre&s;ent to the mind on the &s;malle&s;t hint and mo&s;t trivial relation. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, when it is once pre&s;ent, it engages the attention, and keeps it from wandering to other ob|jects, however &s;trong may be their relation to our fir&s;t object. The imagination pa&s;&s;es ea&s;ily from ob&s;cure to lively ideas, but with difficulty from lively to ob&s;cure. In the one ca&s;e the relation is aided by another prin|ciple: In the other ca&s;e, 'tis oppos'd by it.</P>
<P>Now I have ob&s;erv'd, that tho&s;e two faculties of the mind, the imagination and pa&s;&s;ions, a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in their operation, when their propen&s;ities are &s;imilar, and when they act upon the &s;ame object. The mind has always a propen&s;ity to pa&s;s from a pa&s;&s;ion to any other related to it; and this propen&s;ity is forwarded when the object of the one pa&s;&s;ion is related to that of the o|ther. The two impul&s;es concur with each
<PB N="114" REF="118">
other, and render the whole tran&s;ition more &s;mooth and ea&s;y. But if it &s;hou'd happen, that while the relation of ideas, &s;trictly &s;peaking, continues the &s;ame, its influence, in cau&s;ing a tran&s;ition of the imagination, &s;hou'd no longer take place, 'tis evident its in|fluence on the pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t al&s;o cea&s;e, as be|ing dependent entirely on that tran&s;ition. This is the rea&s;on why pride or humility is not transfus'd into love or hatred with the &s;ame ea&s;e, that the latter pa&s;&s;ions are chang'd into the former. If a per&s;on be my brother I am his likewi&s;e: But tho' the relations be reciprocal, they have very dif|ferent effects on the imagination. The pa&s;|&s;age is &s;mooth and open from the con&s;ider|ation of any per&s;on related to us to that of our&s;elf, of whom we are every moment con&s;cious. But when the affections are once directed to our&s;elf, the fancy pa&s;&s;es not with the &s;ame facility from that object to any other per&s;on, how clo&s;ely &s;o ever connected with us. This ea&s;y or difficult tran&s;ition of the imagination operates upon the pa&s;|&s;ions, and facilitates or retards their tran&s;i|tion; which is a clear proof, that the&s;e two faculties of the pa&s;&s;ions and imagination are connected together, and that the rela|tions of ideas have an influence upon the
<PB N="115" REF="119">
affections. Be&s;ides innumerable experiments that prove this, we here find, that even when the relation remains; if by any par|ticular circum&s;tance its u&s;ual effect upon the fancy in producing an a&s;&s;ociation or tran|&s;ition of ideas, is prevented; its u&s;ual effect upon the pa&s;&s;ions, in conveying us from one to another, is in like manner prevented.</P>
<P>SOME may, perhaps, find a contradiction betwixt this phaenomenon and that of &s;ym|pathy, where the mind pa&s;&s;es ea&s;ily from the idea of our&s;elves to that of any other ob|ject related to us. But this difficulty will vani&s;h, if we con&s;ider that in &s;ympathy our own per&s;on is not the object of any pa&s;&s;ion, nor is there any thing, that fixes our attention on our&s;elves; as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, where we are &s;uppos'd to be actuated with pride or humility. Our&s;elf, indepen|dent of the perception of every other object, is in reality nothing: For which rea&s;on we mu&s;t turn our view to external objects; and 'tis natural for us to con&s;ider with mo&s;t at|tention &s;uch as lie contiguous to us, or re|&s;emble us. But when &s;elf is the object of a pa&s;&s;ion, 'tis not natural to quit the con|&s;ideration of it, till the pa&s;&s;ion be exhau&s;ted; in which ca&s;e the double relations of im|pre&s;&s;ions and ideas can no longer operate.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="120">
SEVENTH EXPERIMENT. To put this whole rea&s;oning to a farther trial, let us make a new experiment; and as we have already &s;een the effects of related pa&s;&s;ions and ideas, let us here &s;uppo&s;e an identity of pa&s;&s;ions along with a relation of ideas; and let us con&s;ider the effects of this new &s;ituation. 'Tis evident a tran&s;ition of the pa&s;&s;ions from the one object to the other is here in all rea&s;on to be expected; &s;ince the relation of ideas is &s;uppos'd &s;till to continue, and an identity of impre&s;&s;ions mu&s;t produce a &s;tronger connexion, than the mo&s;t perfect re&s;emblance, that can be imagin'd. If a double relation, therefore, of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas is able to produce a tran&s;ition from one to the other, much more an identity of impre&s;&s;ions with a relation of ideas. Ac|cordingly we find, that when we either love or hate any per&s;on, the pa&s;&s;ions &s;eldom con|tinue within their fir&s;t bounds; but extend them&s;elves towards all the contiguous ob|jects, and comprehend the friends and re|lations of him we love or hate. Nothing is more natural than to bear a kindne&s;s to one brother on account of our friend&s;hip for another, without any farther examination of his character. A quarrel with one per|&s;on gives us a hatred for the whole family,
<PB N="117" REF="121">
tho' entirely innocent of that, which di&s;|plea&s;es us. In&s;tances of this kind are every where to be met with.</P>
<P>THERE is only one difficulty in this ex|periment, which it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ac|count for, before we proceed any farther. 'Tis evident, that tho' all pa&s;&s;ions pa&s;s ea&s;ily from one object to another related to it, yet this tran&s;ition is made with greater fa|cility, where the more con&s;iderable object is fir&s;t pre&s;ented, and the le&s;&s;er follows it, than where this order is revers'd, and the le&s;&s;er takes the precedence. Thus 'tis more natural for us to love the &s;on upon account of the father, than the father upon account of the &s;on; the &s;ervant for the ma&s;ter, than the ma&s;ter for the &s;ervant; the &s;ubject for the prince, than the prince for the &s;ubject. In like manner we more readily contract a hatred again&s;t a whole family, where our fir&s;t quarrel is with the head of it, than where we are di&s;pleas'd with a &s;on, or &s;er|vant, or &s;ome inferior member. In &s;hort, our pa&s;&s;ions, like other objects, de&s;cend with greater facility than they a&s;cend.</P>
<P>THAT we may comprehend, wherein con&s;i&s;ts the difficulty of explaining this phae|nomenon, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that the very &s;ame rea&s;on, which determines the imagi|nation
<PB N="118" REF="122">
to pa&s;s from remote to contiguous objects, with more facility than from con|tiguous to remote, cau&s;es it likewi&s;e to change with more ea&s;e, the le&s;s for the greater, than the greater for the le&s;s. Whatever has the greate&s;t influence is mo&s;t taken notice of; and whatever is mo&s;t taken notice of, pre&s;ents it&s;elf mo&s;t readily to the ima|gination. We are more apt to over-look in any &s;ubject, what is trivial, than what appears of con&s;iderable moment; but e&s;pe|cially if the latter takes the precedence, and fir&s;t engages our attention. Thus if any accident makes us con&s;ider the <HI>Satellites</HI> of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> our fancy is naturally determin'd to form the idea of that planet; but if we fir&s;t reflect on the principal planet, 'tis more natural for us to overlook its attendants. The mention of the provinces of any em|pire conveys our thought to the &s;eat of the empire; but the fancy returns not with the &s;ame facility to the con&s;ideration of the pro|vinces. The idea of the &s;ervant makes us think of the ma&s;ter; that of the &s;ub|ject carries our view to the prince. But the &s;ame relation has not an equal influence in conveying us back again. And on this is founded that reproach of <HI>Cornelia</HI> to her &s;ons, that they ought to be a&s;ham'd &s;he
<PB N="119" REF="123">
&s;hou'd be more known by the title of the daughter of <HI>Scipio,</HI> than by that of the mo|ther of the <HI>Gracchi.</HI> This was, in other words, exhorting them to render them&s;elves as illu&s;trious and famous as their grand|father, otherwi&s;e the imagination of the peo|ple, pa&s;&s;ing from her who was intermediate, and plac'd in an equal relation to both, wou'd always leave them, and denominate her by what was more con&s;iderable and of greater moment. On the &s;ame principle is founded that common cu&s;tom of making wives bear the name of their hu&s;bands, rather than hu&s;bands that of their wives; as al&s;o the ceremony of giving the precedency to tho&s;e, whom we honour and re&s;pect. We might find many other in&s;tances to confirm this principle, were it not already &s;ufficiently evident.</P>
<P>NOW &s;ince the fancy finds the &s;ame fa|cility in pa&s;&s;ing from the le&s;&s;er to the greater, as from remote to contiguous, why does not this ea&s;y tran&s;ition of ideas a&s;&s;i&s;t the tran&s;ition of pa&s;&s;ions in the former ca&s;e, as well as in the latter? The virtues of a friend or brother produce fir&s;t love, and then pride; becau&s;e in that ca&s;e the imagination pa&s;&s;es from remote to contiguous, according to its propen&s;ity. Our own virtues produce not fir&s;t pride, and then love to a friend or
<PB N="120" REF="124">
brother; becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;age in that ca&s;e wou'd be from contiguous to remote, con|trary to its propen&s;ity. But the love or hatred of an inferior cau&s;esnot readily any pa&s;&s;ion to the &s;uperior, tho' that be the na|tural propen&s;ity of the imagination: While the love or hatred of a &s;uperior, cau&s;es a pa&s;&s;ion to the inferior, contrary to its pro|pen&s;ity. In &s;hort, the &s;ame facility of tran|&s;ition operates not in the &s;ame manner upon &s;uperior and inferior as upon contiguous and remote. The&s;e two phaenomena appear con|tradictory, and require &s;ome attention to be reconcil'd.</P>
<P>As the tran&s;ition of ideas is here made contrary to the natural propen&s;ity of the imagination, that faculty mu&s;t be over|power'd by &s;ome &s;tronger principle of an|other kind; and as there is nothing ever pre&s;ent to the mind but impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, this principle mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily lie in the impre&s;&s;ions. Now it has been ob&s;erv'd, that impre&s;&s;ions or pa&s;&s;ions are connected only by their re&s;emblance, and that where any two pa&s;&s;ions place the mind in the &s;ame or in &s;imilar di&s;po&s;itions, it very na|turally pa&s;&s;es from the one to the other: As on the contrary, a repugnance in the di&s;|po&s;itions produces a difficulty in the tran&s;i|tion
<PB N="121" REF="125">
of the po&s;&s;ions. But 'tis ob&s;ervable, that this repugnance may ari&s;e from a dif|ference of degree as well as of kind; nor do we experience a greater difficulty in pa&s;|&s;ing &s;uddenly from a &s;mall degree of love to a &s;mall degree of hatred, than from a &s;mall to a great degree of either of the&s;e affections. A man, when calm or only moderately a|gitated, is &s;o different, in every re&s;pect, from him&s;elf, when di&s;turbed with a violent pa&s;|&s;ion, that no two per&s;ons can be more un|like; nor is it ea&s;y to pa&s;s from the one ex|treme to the other, without a con&s;iderable interval betwixt them.</P>
<P>THE difficulty is not le&s;s, if it be not rather greater, in pa&s;&s;ing from the &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion to the weak, than in pa&s;&s;ing from the weak to the &s;trong, provided the one pa&s;&s;ion upon its appearance de&s;troys the o|ther, and they do not both of them exi&s;t at once. But the ca&s;e is entirely alter'd, when the pa&s;&s;ions unite together, and actuate the mind at the &s;ame time. A weak pa&s;|&s;ion, when added to a &s;trong, makes not &s;o con&s;iderable change in the di&s;po&s;ition, as a &s;trong when added to a weak; for which rea&s;on there is a clo&s;er connexion betwixt the great degree and the &s;mall, than betwixt the &s;mall degree and the great.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="126">
THE degree of any pa&s;&s;ion depends up|on the nature of its object; and an affec|tion directed to a per&s;on, who is con&s;idera|ble in our eyes, fills and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the mind much more than one, which has for its object a per&s;on we e&s;teem of le&s;s con&s;e|quence. Here then the contradiction be|twixt the propen&s;ities of the imagination and pa&s;&s;ion di&s;plays it&s;elf. When we turn our thought to a great and a &s;mall object, the imagination finds more facility in pa&s;&s;ing from the &s;mall to the great, than from the great to the &s;mall; but the affections find a greater difficulty: And as the affections are a more powerful principle than the imagi|nation, no wonder they prevail over it, and draw the mind to their &s;ide. In &s;pite of the difficulty of pa&s;&s;ing from the idea of great to that of little, a pa&s;&s;ion directed to the former, produces always a &s;imilar pa&s;|&s;ion towards the latter; when the great and little are related together. The idea of the &s;ervant conveys our thought mo&s;t rea|dily to the ma&s;ter; but the hatred or love of the ma&s;ter produces with greater facili|ty anger or good-will to the &s;ervant. The &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ion in this ca&s;e takes the pre|cedence; and the addition of the weaker making no con&s;iderable change on the di&s;po|&s;ition,
<PB N="123" REF="127">
the pa&s;&s;age is by that means ren|der'd more ea&s;y and natural betwixt them.</P>
<P>As in the foregoing experiment we found, that a relation of ideas, which, by any particular circum&s;tance, cea&s;es to pro|duce its u&s;ual effect of facilitating the tran|&s;ition of ideas, cea&s;es likewi&s;e to operate on the pa&s;&s;ions; &s;o in the pre&s;ent experiment we find the &s;ame property of the impre&s;|&s;ions. Two different degrees of the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion are &s;urely related together; but if the &s;maller be fir&s;t pre&s;ent, it has little or no tendency to introduce the greater; and that becau&s;e the addition of the great to the little, produces a more &s;en&s;ible alteration on the temper, than the addition of the little to the great. The&s;e phaenomena, when duly weigh'd, will be found convincing proofs of this hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>AND the&s;e proofs will be confirm'd, if we con&s;ider the manner in which the mind here reconciles the contradiction, I have ob|&s;erv'd betwixt the pa&s;&s;ions and the imagi|nation. The fancy pa&s;&s;es with more facili|ty from the le&s;s to the greater, than from the greater to the le&s;s: But on the contrary a violent pa&s;&s;ion produces more ea&s;ily a feeble, than that does a violent. In this oppo&s;ition the pa&s;&s;ion in the end prevails
<PB N="124" REF="128">
over the imagination; but 'tis commonly by complying with it, and by &s;eeking ano|ther quality, which may counter-ballance that principle, from whence the oppo&s;ition ari&s;es. When we love the father or ma&s;ter of a family, we little think of his children or &s;ervants. But when the&s;e are pre&s;ent with us, or when it lies any ways in our power to &s;erve them, the nearne&s;s and con|tiguity in this ca&s;e encrea&s;es their magni|tude, or at lea&s;t removes that oppo&s;ition, which the fancy makes to the tran&s;ition of the affections. If the imagination finds a difficulty in pa&s;&s;ing from greater to le&s;s, it finds an equal facility in pa&s;&s;ing from re|mote to contiguous, which brings the mat|ter to an equality, and leaves the way open from the one pa&s;&s;ion to the other.</P>
<P>EIGHTH EXPERIMENT. I have ob|&s;erv'd that the tran&s;ition from love or ha|tred to pride or humility, is more ea&s;y than from pride or humility to love or hatred; and that the difficulty, which the imagination finds in pa&s;&s;ing from conti|guous to remote, is the cau&s;e why we &s;carce have any in&s;tance of the latter tran&s;ition of the affections. I mu&s;t, however, make one exception, <HI>viz.</HI> when the very cau&s;e of the pride and humility is plac'd in &s;ome other
<PB N="125" REF="129">
per&s;on. For in that ca&s;e the imagination is nece&s;&s;itated to con&s;ider the per&s;on, nor can it po&s;&s;ibly confine its view to our&s;elves. Thus nothing more readily produces kind|ne&s;s and affection to any per&s;on, than his approbation of our conduct and character: As on the other hand, nothing in&s;pires us with a &s;tronger hatred, than his blame or contempt. Here 'tis evident, that the ori|ginal pa&s;&s;ion is pride or humility, who&s;e object is &s;elf; and that this pa&s;&s;ion is tran&s;|fus'd into love or hatred, who&s;e object is &s;ome other per&s;on, notwith&s;tanding the rule I have already e&s;tabli&s;h'd, <HI>that the imagi|nation pa&s;&s;es with difficulty from contiguous to remote.</HI> But the tran&s;ition in this ca&s;e is not made merely on account of the relation betwixt our&s;elves and the per&s;on; but be|cau&s;e that very per&s;on is the real cau&s;e of our fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, and of con&s;equence is in|timately connected with it. 'Tis his appro|bation that produces pride; and di&s;appro|bation, humility. No wonder, then, the ima|gination returns back again attended with the related pa&s;&s;ions of love and hatred. This is not a contradiction, but an exception to the rule; and an exception that ari&s;es from the &s;ame rea&s;on with the rule it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="130">
SUCH an exception as this is, therefore, ra|ther a confirmation of the rule. And indeed, if we con&s;ider all the eight experiments I have explain'd, we &s;hall find that the &s;ame principle appears in all of them, and that 'tis by means of a tran&s;ition ari&s;ing from a double relation of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, pride and humility, love and hatred are pro|duc'd. An object without <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fir&s;t Experiment</NOTE> a relation, or <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Second and Third Experi|ments.</NOTE> with but one, never produces either of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions; and 'tis<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fourth Experiment.</NOTE> found that the pa&s;|&s;ion always varies in conformity to the re|lation.

tran&s;ition, 'tis found to ari&s;e from &s;ome o|ther circum&s;tance, which counter-ballances it. Thus not only the variations re&s;olve them&s;elves into the general principle, but even the variations of the&s;e variations.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. <HI>Difficulties &s;olv'd.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER &s;o many and &s;uch undeniable proofs drawn from daily experience and ob&s;ervation, it may &s;eem &s;uperfluous to enter into a particular examination of all the cau&s;es of love and hatred. I &s;hall, therefore, employ the &s;equel of this part, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> In re|moving &s;ome difficulties, concerning parti|cular cau&s;es of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. <HI>Secondly,</HI> In examining the compound affections, which ari&s;e from the mixture of love and hatred with other emotions.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more evident, than that any per&s;on acquires our kindne&s;s, or is expos'd to our ill-will, in proportion to the plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s we receive from him, and that the pa&s;&s;ions keep pace exactly with the &s;en&s;ations in all their changes and variations. Whoever can find the means either by his &s;ervices, his beauty, or his flattery, to ren|der
<PB N="128" REF="132">
him&s;elf u&s;eful or agreeable to us, is &s;ure of our affections: As on the other hand, whoever harms or di&s;plea&s;es us never fails to excite our anger or hatred. When our own nation is at war with any other, we dete&s;t them under the character of cruel, perfidious, unju&s;t and violent: But always e&s;teem our|&s;elves and allies equitable, moderate, and merciful. If the general of our enemies be &s;ucce&s;sful, 'tis with difficulty we allow him the figure and character of a man. He is a &s;orcerer: He has a communication with daemons; as is reported of <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> and the <HI>Duke of Luxembourg:</HI> He is bloody-minded, and takes a plea&s;ure in death and de&s;truction. But if the &s;ucce&s;s be on our &s;ide, our commander has all the oppo&s;ite good qualities, and is a pattern of virtue, as well as of courage and conduct. His treachery we call policy: His cruelty is an evil in&s;eparable from war. In &s;hort, every one of his faults we either endeavour to extenuate, or dignify it with the name of that virtue, which approaches it. 'Tis evident the &s;ame method of thinking runs thro' common life.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome, who add another con|dition, and require not only that the pain and plea&s;ure ari&s;e from the per&s;on, but like|wi&s;e
<PB N="129" REF="133">
that it ari&s;e knowingly, and with a particular de&s;ign and intention. A man, who wounds and harms us by accident, be|comes not our enemy upon that account, nor do we think our&s;elves bound by any ties of gratitude to one, who does us any &s;ervice after the &s;ame manner. By the intention we judge of the actions, and ac|cording as that is good or bad, they become cau&s;es of love or hatred.</P>
<P>BUT here we mu&s;t make a di&s;tinction. If that quality in another, which plea&s;es or di&s;plea&s;es, be con&s;tant and inherent in his per&s;on and character, it will cau&s;e love or hatred independent of the intention: But otherwi&s;e a knowledge and de&s;ign is requi|&s;ite, in order to give ri&s;e to the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. One that is di&s;agreeable by his deformity or folly is the object of our aver&s;ion, tho' no|thing be more certain, than that he has not the lea&s;t intention of di&s;plea&s;ing us by the&s;e qualities. But if the unea&s;ine&s;s proceed not from a quality, but an action, which is produc'd and annihilated in a moment, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary, in order to produce &s;ome re|lation, and connect this action &s;ufficiently with the per&s;on, that it be deriv'd from a particular fore-thought and de&s;ign. 'Tis not enough, that the action ari&s;e from the
<PB N="130" REF="134">
per&s;on, and have him for its immediate cau&s;e and author. This relation alone is too feeble and incon&s;tant to be a foundation for the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. It reaches not the &s;en|&s;ible and thinking part, and neither pro|ceeds from any thing <HI>durable</HI> in him, nor leaves any thing behind it; but pa&s;&s;es in a moment, and is as if it had never been. On the other hand, an intention &s;hews certain qualities, which remaining after the action is perform'd, connect it with the per&s;on, and facilitate the tran&s;ition of ideas from one to the other. We can never think of him without reflecting on the&s;e qualities; unle&s;s repentance and a change of life have produc'd an alteration in that re&s;pect: In which ca&s;e the pa&s;&s;ion is likewi&s;e alter'd. This therefore is one rea&s;on, why an inten|tion is requi&s;ite to excite either love or ha|tred.</P>
<P>BUT we mu&s;t farther con&s;ider, that an intention, be&s;ides its &s;trengthening the relation of ideas, is often nece&s;&s;ary to pro|duce a relation of impre&s;&s;ions, and give ri&s;e to plea&s;ure and unea&s;ine&s;s. For 'tis ob&s;erv|able, that the principal part of an injury is the contempt and hatred, which it &s;hews in the per&s;on, that injures us; and without that, the mere harm gives us a le&s;s &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="131" REF="135">
unea&s;ine&s;s. In like manner, a good office is agreeable, chiefly becau&s;e it flatters our vanity, and is a proof of the kindne&s;s and e&s;teem of the per&s;on, who performs it. The removal of the intention, removes the mortification in the one ca&s;e, and vanity in the other; and mu&s;t of cour&s;e cau&s;e a remarkable diminution in the pa&s;&s;ions of love and hatred.</P>
<P>I GRANT, that the&s;e effects of the re|moval of de&s;ign, in dimini&s;hing the rela|tions of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, are not en|tire, nor able to remove every degree of the&s;e relations. But then I a&s;k, if the re|moval of de&s;ign be able entirely to remove the pa&s;&s;ion of love and hatred? Experience, I am &s;ure, informs us of the contrary, nor is there any thing more certain, than that men often fall into a violent anger for in|juries, which they them&s;elves mu&s;t own to be entirely involuntary and accidental. This emotion, indeed, cannot be of long continuance; but &s;till is &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that there is a natural connexion betwixt unea&s;ine&s;s and anger, and that the relation of impre&s;&s;ions will operate upon a very &s;mall relation of ideas. But when the violence of the impre&s;&s;ion is once a little abated, the defect of the relation begins to be better felt;
<PB N="132" REF="136">
and as the character of a per&s;on is no wi&s;e intere&s;ted in &s;uch injuries as are ca&s;ual and involuntary, it &s;eldom happens that on their account, we entertain a la&s;ting en|mity.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this doctrine by a parallel in&s;tance, we may ob&s;erve, that not only the unea&s;ine&s;s, which proceeds from ano|ther by accident, has but little force to ex|cite our pa&s;&s;ion, but al&s;o that which ari&s;es from an acknowledg'd nece&s;&s;ity and duty. One that has a real de&s;ign of harming us, proceeding not from hatred and ill-will, but from ju&s;tice and equity, draws not upon him our anger, if we be in any degree rea|&s;onable; notwith&s;tanding he is both the cau&s;e, and the knowing cau&s;e of our &s;uf|ferings. Let us examine a little this phae|nomenon.</P>
<P>'TIS evident in the fir&s;t place, that this circum&s;tance is not deci&s;ive; and tho' it may be able to dimini&s;h the pa&s;&s;ions, 'tis &s;eldom it can entirely remove them. How few criminals are there, who have no ill-will to the per&s;on, that accu&s;es them, or to the judge, that condemns them, even tho' they be con&s;cious of their own de&s;erts? In like manner our antagoni&s;t in a law-&s;uit, and our competitor for any
<PB N="133" REF="137">
office, are commonly regarded as our ene|mies; tho' we mu&s;t acknowledge, if we wou'd but reflect a moment, that their mo|tive is entirely as ju&s;tifiable as our own.</P>
<P>BESIDES we may con&s;ider, that when we receive harm from any per&s;on, we are apt to imagine him criminal, and 'tis with extreme difficulty we allow of his ju&s;tice and innocence. This is a clear proof, that, independent of the opinion of iniquity, any harm of unea&s;ine&s;s has a natural tendency to excite our hatred, and that afterwards we &s;eek for rea&s;ons upon which we may ju&s;ti|fy and e&s;tabli&s;h the pa&s;&s;ion. Here the idea of injury produces not the pa&s;&s;ion, but ari&s;es from it.</P>
<P>NOR is it any wonder that pa&s;&s;ion &s;hou'd produce the opinion of injury; &s;ince other|wi&s;e it mu&s;t &s;uffer a con&s;iderable diminu|tion, which all the pa&s;&s;ions avoid as much po&s;&s;ible. The removal of injury may re|move the anger, without proving that the anger ari&s;es only from the injury. The harm and the ju&s;tice are two contrary ob|jects, of which the one has a tendency to produce hatred, and the other love; and 'tis according to their different degrees, and our particular turn of thinking, that either
<PB N="134" REF="138">
of the objects prevails, and excites its proper pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IV. <HI>Of the love of relations.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING given a rea&s;on, why &s;eve|ral actions, that cau&s;e a real plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s, excite not any degree, or but a &s;mall one, of the pa&s;&s;ion of love or ha|tred towards the actors; 'twill be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew, wherein con&s;i&s;ts the plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s of many objects, which we find by experience to produce the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the preceding &s;y&s;tem there is always requir'd a double relation of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas betwixt the cau&s;e and effect, in order to produce either love or hatred. But tho' this be univer&s;ally true, 'tis remarkable that the pa&s;&s;ion of love may be excited by only one <HI>relation</HI> of a diffe|rent kind, <HI>viz.</HI> betwixt our&s;elves and the object; or more properly &s;peaking, that this relation is always attended with both the others. Whoever is united to us by any connexion is always &s;ure of a &s;hare of our love, proportion'd to the connexion, with|out enquiring into his other qualities. Thus
<PB N="135" REF="139">
the relation of blood produces the &s;tronge&s;t tie the mind is capable of in the love of parents to their children, and a le&s;&s;er degree of the &s;ame affection, as the relation le&s;|&s;ens. Nor has con&s;anguinity alone this ef|fect, but any other relation without excep|tion. We love our country-men, our neigh|bours, tho&s;e of the &s;ame trade, profe&s;&s;ion, and even name with our&s;elves. Every one of the&s;e relations is e&s;teem'd &s;ome tie, and gives a title to a &s;hare of our affection.</P>
<P>THERE is another phaenomenon, which is parallel to this, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>acquaintance,</HI> without any kind of relation, gives ri&s;e to love and kindne&s;s. When we have contrac|ted a habitude and intimacy with any per|&s;on; tho' in frequenting his company we have not been able to di&s;cover any very va|luable quality, of which he is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd; yet we cannot forbear preferring him to &s;trang|ers, of who&s;e &s;uperior merit we are fully convinc'd. The&s;e two phaenomena of the effects of relation and acquaintance will give mutual light to each other, and may be both explain'd from the &s;ame principle.</P>
<P>THOSE, who take a plea&s;ure in declaim|ing again&s;t human nature, have ob&s;erv'd, that man is altogether in&s;ufficient to &s;upport him&s;elf; and that when you loo&s;en all the
<PB N="136" REF="140">
holds, which he has of external objects, he immediately drops down into the deepe&s;t melancholy and de&s;pair. From this, &s;ay they, proceeds that continual &s;earch after amu&s;ement in gaming, in hunting, in bu&s;i|ne&s;s; by which we endeavour to forget our|&s;elves, and excite our &s;pirits from the lan|guide &s;tate, into which they fall, when not &s;u&s;tain'd by &s;ome bri&s;k and lively emo|tion. To this method of thinking I &s;o far agree, that I own the mind to be in&s;uffi|cient, of it&s;elf, to its own entertainment, and that it naturally &s;eeks after foreign objects, which may produce a lively &s;en&s;ation, and agitate the &s;pirits. On the appear|ance of &s;uch an object it awakes, as it were, from a dream: The blood flows with a new tide: The heart is elevated: And the whole man acquires a vigour, which he cannot command in his &s;olitary and calm moments. Hence company is naturally &s;o rejoicing, as pre&s;enting the livelie&s;t of all objects, <HI>viz.</HI> a rational and thinking Being like our&s;elves, who communicates to us all the actions of his mind; makes us privy to his inmo&s;t &s;en|timents and affections; and lets us &s;ee, in the very in&s;tant of their production, all the emotions, which are caus'd by any object. Every lively idea is agreeable, but e&s;pecially
<PB N="137" REF="141">
that of a pa&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e &s;uch an idea be|comes a kind of pa&s;&s;ion, and gives a more &s;en&s;ible agitation to the mind, than any o|ther image or conception.</P>
<P>THIS being once admitted, all the re&s;t is ea&s;y. For as the company of &s;trangers is agreeable to us for <HI>a &s;hort time,</HI> by inli|vening our thought; &s;o the company of our relations and acquaintance mu&s;t be pe|culiarly agreeable, becau&s;e it has this effect in a greater degree, and is of more <HI>durable</HI> influence. Whatever is related to us is con|ceiv'd in a lively manner by the ea&s;y tran|&s;ition from our&s;elves to the related object. Cu&s;tom al&s;o, or acquaintance facilitates the entrance, and &s;trengthens the conception of any object. The fir&s;t ca&s;e is parallel to our rea&s;onings from cau&s;e and effect; the &s;econd to education. And as rea&s;oning and educa|tion concur only in producing a lively and &s;trong idea of any object; &s;o is this the only particular, which is common to rela|tion and acquaintance. This mu&s;t, there|fore, be the influencing quality, by which they produce all their common effects; and love or kindne&s;s being one of the&s;e effects, it mu&s;t be from the force and liveline&s;s of conception, that the pa&s;&s;ion is deriv'd. Such a conception is peculiarly agreeable, and
<PB N="138" REF="142">
makes us have an affectionate regard for every thing, that produces it, when the proper object of kindne&s;s and good-will.</P>
<P>'TIS obvious, that people a&s;&s;ociate to|gether according to their particular tempers and di&s;po&s;itions, and that men of gay tem|pers naturally love the gay; as the &s;erious bear an affection to the &s;erious. This not only happens, where they remark this re|&s;emblance betwixt them&s;elves and others, but al&s;o by the natural cour&s;e of the di&s;po|&s;ition, and by a certain &s;ympathy, which always ari&s;es betwixt &s;imilar characters. Where they remark the re&s;emblance, it ope|rates after the manner of a relation, by pro|ducing a connexion of ideas. Where they do not remark it, it operates by &s;ome other principle; and if this latter principle be &s;imilar to the former, it mu&s;t be receiv'd as a confirmation of the foregoing rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>THE idea of our&s;elves is always inti|mately pre&s;ent to us, and conveys a &s;en|&s;ible degree of vivacity to the idea of any other object, to which we are related. This lively idea changes by degrees into a real impre&s;&s;ion; the&s;e two kinds of perception being in a great mea&s;ure the &s;ame, and dif|fering only in their degrees of force and vivacity. But this change mu&s;t be produc'd
<PB N="139" REF="143">
with the greater ea&s;e, that our natural tem|per gives us a propen&s;ity to the &s;ame im|pre&s;&s;ion, which we ob&s;erve in others, and makes it ari&s;e upon any &s;light occa&s;ion. In that ca&s;e re&s;emblance converts the idea into an impre&s;&s;ion, not only by means of the relation, and by transfu&s;ing the original vi|vacity into the related idea; but al&s;o by pre|&s;enting &s;uch materials as take fire from the lea&s;t &s;park. And as in both ca&s;es a love or affection ari&s;es from the re&s;emblance, we may learn that a &s;ympathy with others is agreeable only by giving an emotion to the &s;pirits, &s;ince an ea&s;y &s;ympathy and corre|&s;pondent emotions are alone common to <HI>relation, acquaintance,</HI> and <HI>re&s;emblance.</HI></P>
<P>THE great propen&s;ity men have to pride may be con&s;ider'd as another &s;imilar phae|nomenon. It often happens, that after we have liv'd a con&s;iderable time in any city; however at fir&s;t it might be di&s;agreeable to us; yet as we become familiar with the objects, and contract an acquaintance, tho' merely with the &s;treets and buildings, the aver&s;ion dimini&s;hes by degrees, and at la&s;t changes into the oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ion. The mind finds a &s;atisfaction and ea&s;e in the view of objects, to which it is accu&s;tom'd, and naturally prefers them to others, which,
<PB N="140" REF="144">
tho', perhaps, in them&s;elves more valuable, are le&s;s known to it. By the &s;ame quality of the mind we are &s;educ'd into a good opinion of our&s;elves, and of all objects, that belong to us. They appear in a &s;tronger light; are more agreeable; and con&s;equently fitter &s;ubjects of pride and vanity, than any other.</P>
<P>IT may not be ami&s;s, in treating of the affection we bear our acquaintance and relations, to ob&s;erve &s;ome pretty curious phaenomena, which attend it. 'Tis ea&s;y to remark in common life, that children e&s;teem their relation to their mother to be weaken'd, in a great mea&s;ure, by her &s;econd marriage, and no longer regard her with the &s;ame eye, as if &s;he had continu'd in her &s;tate of wi|dow-hood. Nor does this happen only, when they have felt any inconveniencies from her &s;econd marriage, or when her hu&s;band is much her inferior; but even without any of the&s;e con&s;iderations, and merely becau&s;e &s;he has become part of an|other family. This al&s;o takes place with regard to the &s;econd marriage of a father; but in a much le&s;s degree: And 'tis certain the ties of blood are not &s;o much loo&s;en'd in the latter ca&s;e as by the marriage of a mother. The&s;e two phaenomena are re|markable
<PB N="141" REF="145">
in them&s;elves, but much more &s;o when compar'd.</P>
<P>IN order to produce a perfect relation betwixt two objects, 'tis requi&s;ite, not only that the imagination be convey'd from one to the other by re&s;emblance, contiguity or cau&s;ation, but al&s;o that it return back from the &s;econd to the fir&s;t with the &s;ame ea&s;e and facility. At fir&s;t &s;ight this may &s;eem a nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable con&s;equence. If one object re&s;emble another, the latter ob|ject mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re&s;emble the former. If one object be the cau&s;e of another, the &s;econd object is effect to its cau&s;e. 'Tis the &s;ame ca&s;e with contiguity: And therefore the relation being always reciprocal, it may be thought, that the return of the imagi|nation from the &s;econd to the fir&s;t mu&s;t al&s;o, in every ca&s;e, be equally natural as its pa&s;&s;age from the fir&s;t to the &s;econd. But upon farther examination we &s;hall ea&s;ily di&s;|cover our mi&s;take. For &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;e|cond object, be&s;ide its reciprocal relation to the fir&s;t, to have al&s;o a &s;trong relation to a third object; in that ca&s;e the thought, pa&s;|&s;ing from the fir&s;t object to the &s;econd, re|turns not back with the &s;ame facility, tho' the relation continues the &s;ame; but is rea|dily carry'd on to the third object, by means
<PB N="142" REF="146">
of the new relation, which pre&s;ents it&s;elf, and gives a new impul&s;e to the imagina|tion. This new relation, therefore, weak|ens the tie betwixt the fir&s;t and &s;econd ob|jects. The fancy is by its very nature wavering and incon&s;tant; and con&s;iders al|ways two objects as more &s;trongly re|lated together, where it finds the pa&s;&s;age equally ea&s;y both in going and returning, than where the tran&s;ition is ea&s;y only in one of the&s;e motions. The double motion is a kind of a double tie, and binds the objects together in the clo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t in|timate manner.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd marriage of a mother breaks not the relation of child and parent; and that relation &s;uffices to convey my imagina|tion from my&s;elf to her with the greate&s;t ea&s;e and facility. But after the imagination is arriv'd at this point of view, it finds its object to be &s;urrounded with &s;o many other relations, which challenge its regard, that it knows not which to prefer, and is at a lo&s;s what new object to pitch upon. The ties of intere&s;t and duty bind her to another family, and prevent that return of the fancy from her to my&s;elf, which is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the union. The thought has no longer the vibration, requi&s;ite to &s;et it per|fectly
<PB N="143" REF="147">
at ea&s;e, and indulge its inclination to change. It goes with facility, but returns with difficulty; and by that interruption finds the relation much weaken'd from what it wou'd be were the pa&s;&s;age open and ea&s;y on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>NOW to give a rea&s;on, why this effect follows not in the &s;ame degree upon the &s;econd marriage of a father: we may reflect on what has been prov'd already, that tho' the imagination goes ea&s;ily from the view of a le&s;&s;er object to that of a greater, yet it returns not with the &s;ame facility from the greater to the le&s;s. When my imagination goes from my&s;elf to my father, it pa&s;&s;es not &s;o readily from him to his &s;econd wife, nor con&s;iders him as entering into a different family, but as continuing the head of that family, of which I am my&s;elf a part. His &s;uperiority prevents the ea&s;y tran&s;ition of the thought from him to his &s;pou&s;e, but keeps the pa&s;&s;age &s;till open for a return to my&s;elf along the &s;ame relation of child and parent. He is not &s;unk in the new relation he ac|quires; &s;o that the double motion or vibra|tion of thought is &s;till ea&s;y and natural.

<HEAD>SECT. V. <HI>Of our e&s;teem for the rich and powerful.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOTHING has a greater tendency to give us an e&s;teem for any per&s;on, than his power and riches; or a contempt, than his poverty and meanne&s;s: And as e&s;teem and contempt are to be con&s;ider'd as &s;pecies of love and hatred, 'twill be pro|per in this place to explain the&s;e phaeno|mena.</P>
<P>HERE it happens mo&s;t fortunately, that the greate&s;t difficulty is not to di&s;cover a principle capable of producing &s;uch an effect, but to choo&s;e the chief and predominant among &s;everal, that pre&s;ent them&s;elves. The <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> we take in the riches of others,
<PB N="145" REF="149">
and the <HI>e&s;teem</HI> we have for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors may be a&s;crib'd to three different cau&s;es. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To the objects they po&s;&s;e&s;s; &s;uch as hou&s;es, gardens, equipages; which, being agreeable in them&s;elves, nece&s;&s;arily produce a &s;entiment of plea&s;ure in every one, that either con&s;iders or &s;urveys them. <HI>Secondly,</HI> To the expectation of advantage from the rich and powerful by our &s;haring their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> To &s;ympathy, which makes us partake of the &s;atisfaction of every one, that approaches us. All the&s;e princi|ples may concur in producing the pre&s;ent phaenomenon. The que&s;tion is, to which of them we ought principally to a&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>'TIS certain, that the fir&s;t principle, <HI>viz.</HI> the reflection on agreeable objects, has a greater influence, than what, at fir&s;t &s;ight, we may be apt to imagine. We &s;eldom reflect on what is beautiful or ugly, agree|able or di&s;agreeable, without an emotion of plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s; and tho' the&s;e &s;en&s;ations appear not much in our common indolent way of thinking, 'tis ea&s;y, either in reading or conver&s;ation, to di&s;cover them. Men of wit always turn the di&s;cour&s;e on &s;ubjects that are entertaining to the ima|gination; and poets never pre&s;ent any objects but &s;uch as are of the &s;ame nature. Mr.
<PB N="146" REF="150">
<HI>Philips</HI> has cho&s;en <HI>Cyder</HI> for the &s;ubject of an excellent poem. Beer wou'd not have been &s;o proper, as being neither &s;o agreeable to the ta&s;te nor eye. But he wou'd cer|tainly have preferr'd wine to either of them, cou'd his native country have afforded him &s;o ageeeable a liquor. We may learn from thence, that every thing, which is agreeable to the &s;en&s;es, is al&s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure agreeable to the fancy, and conveys to the thought an image of that &s;atisfaction, which it gives by its real application to the bodily organs.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the&s;e rea&s;ons may induce us to comprehend this delicacy of the imagi|nation among the cau&s;es of the re&s;pect, which we pay the rich and powerful, there are many other rea&s;ons, that may keep us from regarding it as the &s;ole or prin|cipal. For as the ideas of plea&s;ure can have an influence only by means of their viva|city, which makes them approach impre&s;|&s;ions, 'tis mo&s;t natural tho&s;e ideas &s;hou'd have that influence, which are favour'd by mo&s;t circum&s;tances, and have a natural ten|dency to become &s;trong and lively; &s;uch as our ideas of the pa&s;&s;ions and &s;en&s;ations of any human creature. Every human crea|ture re&s;embles our&s;elves, and by that means has an advantage above any other object, in operating on the imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="151">
BESIDES, if we con&s;ider the nature of that faculty, and the great influence which all relations have upon it, we &s;hall ea&s;ily be per&s;waded, that however the ideas of the plea&s;ant wines, mu&s;ic, or gardens, which the rich man enjoys, may become lively and agreeable, the fancy will not confine it&s;elf to them, but will carry its view to the related objects; and in particular, to the per&s;on, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them. And this is the more natural, that the plea&s;ant idea or image produces here a pa&s;&s;ion towards the per&s;on, by means of his relation to the object; &s;o that 'tis unavoidable but he mu&s;t en|ter into the original conception, &s;ince he makes the object of the derivative pa&s;&s;ion. But if he enters into the original conception, and is con&s;ider'd as enjoying the&s;e agreeable objects, 'tis <HI>&s;ympathy,</HI> which is properly the cau&s;e of the affection; and the <HI>third</HI> principle is more powerful and univer&s;al than the <HI>fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>ADD to this, that riches and power a|lone, even tho' unemploy'd, naturally cau&s;e e&s;teem and re&s;pect: And con&s;equently the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions ari&s;e not from the idea of any beau|tiful or agreeable objects. 'Tis true; money implies a kind of repre&s;entation of &s;uch ob|jects, by the power it affords of obtaining them; and for that rea&s;on may &s;till be e&s;|teem'd proper to convey tho&s;e agreeable
<PB N="148" REF="152">
images, which may give ri&s;e to the pa&s;&s;ion. But as this pro&s;pect is very di&s;tant, 'tis more natural for us to take a contiguous object, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;atisfaction, which this power af|fords the per&s;on, who is po&s;&s;e&s;t of it. And of this we &s;hall be farther &s;atisfy'd, if we con&s;ider, that riches repre&s;ent the goods of life, only by means of the will; which em|ploys them; and therefore imply in their very nature an idea of the per&s;on, and can|not be con&s;ider'd without a kind of &s;ym|pathy with his &s;en&s;ations and enjoyments.</P>
<P>THIS we may confirm by a reflection, which to &s;ome will, perhaps, appear too &s;ubtile and refin'd. I have already ob&s;erv'd, that power, as di&s;tingui&s;h'd from its exer|ci&s;e, has either no meaning at all, or is nothing but a po&s;&s;ibility or probability of exi&s;tence; by which any object approaches to reality, and has a &s;en&s;ible influence on the mind. I have al&s;o ob&s;erv'd, that this approach, by an illu&s;ion of the fancy, ap|pears much greater, when we our&s;elves are po&s;&s;e&s;t of the power, than when it is en|joy'd by another; and that in the former ca&s;e the objects &s;eem to touch upon the very verge of reality, and convey almo&s;t an equal &s;atisfaction, as if actually in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Now I a&s;&s;ert, that where we e&s;teem a per|&s;on upon account of his riches, we mu&s;t
<PB N="149" REF="153">
enter into this &s;entiment of the proprietor, and that without &s;uch a &s;ympathy the idea of the agreeable objects, which they give him the power to produce, wou'd have but a feeble influence upon us. An avaritious man is re&s;pected for his money, tho' he &s;carce is po&s;&s;e&s;t of a <HI>power;</HI> that is, there &s;carce is a <HI>probability</HI> or even <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of his em|ploying it in the acqui&s;ition of the plea&s;ures and conveniences of life. To him&s;elf alone this power &s;eems perfect and entire; and therefore we mu&s;t receive his &s;entiments by &s;ympathy, before we can have a &s;trong in|ten&s;e idea of the&s;e enjoyments, or e&s;teem him upon account of them.</P>
<P>THUS we have found, that the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> principle, <HI>viz. the agreeable idea of tho&s;e objects, which riches afford the enjoyment of;</HI> re&s;olves it&s;elf in a great mea&s;ure into the <HI>third,</HI> and becomes a <HI>&s;ympathy</HI> with the per|&s;on we e&s;teem or love. Let us now ex|amine the <HI>&s;econd</HI> principle, <HI>viz. the agree|able expectation of advantage,</HI> and &s;ee what force we may ju&s;tly attribute to it.</P>
<P>'TIS obvious, that tho' riches and au|thority undoubtedly give their owner a power of doing us &s;ervice, yet this power is not to be con&s;ider'd as on the &s;ame foot|ing with that, which they afford him, of
<PB N="148" REF="154">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="149" REF="155">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="150" REF="156">
plea&s;ing him&s;elf, and &s;atisfying his own ap|petites. Self-love approaches the power and exerci&s;e very near each other in the latter ca&s;e; but in order to produce a &s;imilar ef|fect in the former, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e a friend|&s;hip and good-will to be conjoin'd with the riches. Without that circum&s;tance 'tis dif|ficult to conceive on what we can found our hope of advantage from the riches of others, tho' there is nothing more certain, than that we naturally e&s;teem and re&s;pect the rich, even before we di&s;cover in them any &s;uch favourable di&s;po&s;ition towards us.</P>
<P>BUT I carry this farther, and ob&s;erve, not only that we re&s;pect the rich and pow|erful, where they &s;hew no inclination to &s;erve us, but al&s;o when we lie &s;o much out of the &s;phere of their activity, that they cannot even be &s;uppos'd to be endow'd with that power. Pri&s;oners of war are always treated with a re&s;pect &s;uitable to their con|dition; and 'tis certain riches go very far towards fixing the condition of any per&s;on. If birth and quality enter for a &s;hare, this &s;till affords us an argument of the &s;ame kind. For what is it we call a man of birth, but one who is de&s;cended from a long &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of rich and powerful ance&s;tors, and who acquires our e&s;teem by his relation to per|&s;ons
<PB N="151" REF="157">
whom we e&s;teem? His ance&s;tors, there|fore, tho' dead, are re&s;pected, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, on account of their riches, and con|&s;equently without any kind of expectation.</P>
<P>BUT not to go &s;o far as pri&s;oners of war and the dead to find in&s;tances of this di&s;|intere&s;ted e&s;teem for riches, let us ob&s;erve with a little attention tho&s;e phaenomena that occur to us in common life and conver&s;ation. A man, who is him&s;elf of a competent for|tune, upon coming into a company of &s;trangers, naturally treats them with different degrees of re&s;pect and deference, as he is inform'd of their different fortunes and con|ditions; tho' 'tis impo&s;&s;ible he can ever pro|po&s;e, and perhaps wou'd not accept of any advantage from them. A traveller is always admitted into company, and meets with civility, in proportion as his train and equi|page &s;peak him a man of great or mode|rate fortune. In &s;hort, the different ranks of men are, in a great mea&s;ure, regulated by riches, and that with regard to &s;uperiors as well as inferiors, &s;trangers as well as ac|quaintance.</P>
<P>THERE is, indeed, an an&s;wer to the&s;e arguments, drawn from the influence of <HI>ge|neral rules.</HI> It may be pretended, that be|ing accu&s;tom'd to expect &s;uccour and pro|tection
<PB N="152" REF="158">
from the rich and powerful, and to e&s;teem them upon that account, we extend the &s;ame &s;entiments to tho&s;e, who re&s;emble them in their fortune, but from whom we can never hope for any advantage. The general rule &s;till prevails, and by giving a bent to the imagination draws along the pa&s;&s;ion, in the &s;ame manner as if its proper object were real and exi&s;tent.</P>
<P>BUT that this principle does not here take place, will ea&s;ily appear, if we con&s;ider, that in order to e&s;tabli&s;h a general rule, and extend it beyond its proper bounds, there is requir'd a certain uniformity in our ex|perience, and a great &s;uperiority of tho&s;e in&s;tances, which are conformable to the rule, above the contrary. But here the ca&s;e is quite otherwi&s;e. Of a hundred men of credit and fortune I meet with, there is not, perhaps, one from whom I can expect advantage; &s;o that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible any cu&s;tom can ever prevail in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>UPON THE WHOLE, there remains no|thing, which can give us an e&s;teem for power and riches, and a contempt for mean|ne&s;s and poverty, except the principle of <HI>&s;ympathy,</HI> by which we enter into the &s;en|timents of the rich and poor, and partake of their plea&s;ure and unea&s;ine&s;s. Riches
<PB N="153" REF="159">
give &s;atisfaction to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and this &s;atisfaction is convey'd to the beholder by the imagination, which produces an idea re&s;embling the original impre&s;&s;ion in force and vivacity. This agreeable idea or im|pre&s;&s;ion is connected with love, which is an agreeable pa&s;&s;ion. It proceeds from a thinking con&s;cious being, which is the very object of love. From this relation of im|pre&s;&s;ions, and identity of ideas, the pa&s;&s;ion ari&s;es, according to my hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t method of reconciling us to this opinion is to take a general &s;urvey of the univer&s;e, and ob&s;erve the force of &s;ympathy thro' the whole animal creation, and the ea&s;y communication of &s;entiments from one thinking being to another. In all creatures, that prey not upon others, and are not agi|tated with violent pa&s;&s;ions, there appears a remarkable de&s;ire of company, which a&s;|&s;ociates them together, without any advan|tages they can ever propo&s;e to reap from their union. This is &s;till more con&s;picuous in man, as being the creature of the uni|ver&s;e, who has the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire of &s;ociety, and is fitted for it by the mo&s;t ad|vantages. We can form no wi&s;h, which has not a reference to &s;ociety. A perfect &s;oli|tude is, perhaps, the greate&s;t puni&s;hment
<PB N="154" REF="160">
we can &s;uffer. Every plea&s;ure langui&s;hes when enjoy'd a-part from company, and every pain becomes more cruel and intole|rable. Whatever other pa&s;&s;ions we may be actuated by; pride, ambition, avarice, curio&s;ity, revenge or lu&s;t; the &s;oul or ani|mating principle of them all is &s;ympathy; nor wou'd they have any force, were we to ab&s;tract entirely from the thoughts and &s;enti|ments of others. Let all the powers and ele|ments of nature con&s;pire to &s;erve and obey one man: Let the &s;un ri&s;e and &s;et at his command: The &s;ea and rivers roll as he plea&s;|es, and the earth furni&s;h &s;pontaneou&s;ly what|ever may be u&s;eful or agreeable to him: He will &s;till be mi&s;erable, till you give him &s;ome one per&s;on at lea&s;t, with whom he may &s;hare his happine&s;s, and who&s;e e&s;teem and friend&s;hip he may enjoy.</P>
<P>THIS conclu&s;ion from a general view of human nature, we may confirm by par|ticular in&s;tances, wherein the force of &s;ym|pathy is very remarkable. Mo&s;t kinds of beauty are deriv'd from this origin; and tho' our fir&s;t object be &s;ome &s;en&s;ele&s;s ina|nimate piece of matter, 'tis &s;eldom we re&s;t there, and carry not our view to its influence on &s;en&s;ible and rational creatures. A man, who &s;hews us any hou&s;e or building, takes par|ticular
<PB N="155" REF="161">
care among other things to point out the convenience of the apartments, the ad|vantages of their &s;ituation, and the little room lo&s;t in the &s;tairs, anti-chambers and pa&s;&s;ages; and indeed 'tis evident, the chief part of the beauty con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e particu|lars. The ob&s;ervation of convenience gives plea&s;ure, &s;ince convenience is a beauty. But after what manner does it give plea&s;ure? 'Tis certain our own intere&s;t is not in the lea&s;t concern'd; and as this is a beauty of intere&s;t, not of form, &s;o to &s;peak, it mu&s;t delight us merely by communication, and by our &s;ympathizing with the proprietor of the lodging. We enter into his intere&s;t by the force of imagination, and feel the &s;ame &s;atisfaction, that the objects naturally occa&s;ion in him.</P>
<P>THIS ob&s;ervation extends to tables, chairs, &s;critoires, chimneys, coaches, &s;adles, ploughs, and indeed to every work of art; it being an univer&s;al rule, that their beauty is chief|ly deriv'd from their utility, and from their fitne&s;s for that purpo&s;e, to which they are de&s;tin'd. But this is an advantage, that concerns only the owner, nor is there any thing but &s;ympathy, which can intere&s;t the &s;pectator.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="162">
'TIS evident, that nothing renders a field more agreeable than its fertility, and that &s;carce any advantages of ornament or &s;itua|tion will be able to equal this beauty. 'Tis the &s;ame ca&s;e with particular trees and plants, as with the field on which they grow. I know not but a plain, overgrown with furze and broom, may be, in it&s;elf, as beautiful as a hill cover'd with vines or o|live-trees; tho' it will never appear &s;o to one, who is acquainted with the value of each. But this is a beauty merely of imagination, and has no foundation in what appears to the &s;en&s;es. Fertility and value have a plain reference to u&s;e; and that to riches, joy, and plenty; in which tho' we have no hope of partaking, yet we enter into them by the vivacity of the fan|cy, and &s;hare them, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, with the proprietor.</P>
<P>THERE is no rule in painting more rea|&s;onable than that of ballancing the figures, and placing them with the greate&s;t exact|ne&s;s on their proper center of gravity. A figure, which is not ju&s;tly ballanc'd, is di&s;|agreeable; and that becau&s;e it conveys the ideas of its fall, of harm, and of pain: Which ideas are painful, when by &s;ympa|thy
<PB N="157" REF="163">
they acquire any degree of force and vivacity.</P>
<P>ADD to this, that the principal part of per&s;onal beauty is an air of health and vi|gour, and &s;uch a con&s;truction of members as promi&s;es &s;trength and activity. This idea of beauty cannot be accounted for but by &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>IN general we may remark, that the minds of men are mirrors to one another, not only becau&s;e they reflect each others e|motions, but al&s;o becau&s;e tho&s;e rays of pa&s;|&s;ions, &s;entiments and opinions may be often reverberated, and may decay away by in|&s;en&s;ible degrees. Thus the plea&s;ure, which a rich man receives from his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, being thrown upon the beholder, cau&s;es a plea&s;ure and e&s;teem; which &s;entiments again, being perceiv'd and &s;ympathiz'd with, encrea&s;e the plea&s;ure of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and being once more reflected, become a new foundation for plea&s;ure and e&s;teem in the beholder. There is certainly an original &s;atisfaction in riches deriv'd from that power, which they be&s;tow, of enjoying all the plea&s;ures of life; and as this is their very nature and e&s;&s;ence, it mu&s;t be the fir&s;t &s;ource of all the pa&s;|&s;ions, which ari&s;e from them. One of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions is that of
<PB N="158" REF="164">
love or e&s;teem in others, which therefore proceeds from a &s;ympathy with the plea&s;ure of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. But the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or has al&s;o a &s;econdary &s;atisfaction in riches ari&s;ing from the love and e&s;teem he acquires by them, and this &s;atisfaction is nothing but a &s;econd reflexion of that original plea&s;ure, which proceeded from him&s;elf. This &s;econdary &s;atis|faction or vanity becomes one of the principal recommendations of riches, and is the chief rea&s;on, why we either de&s;ire them for our|&s;elves, or e&s;teem them in others. Here then is a third rebound of the original plea&s;ure; after which 'tis difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h the images and reflexions, by rea&s;on of their faintne&s;s and confu&s;ion.</P>

<P>IDEAS may be compar'd to the exten|&s;ion and &s;olidity of matter, and impre&s;|&s;ions, e&s;pecially reflective ones, to colours. ta&s;tes, &s;mells and other &s;en&s;ible qualities. Ideas never admit of a total union, but are endow'd with a kind of impenetrability, by which they exclude each other, and are ca|pable
<PB N="159" REF="165">
of forming a compound by their conjunction, not by their mixture. On the other hand, impre&s;&s;ions and pa&s;&s;ions are &s;u&s;ceptible of an entire union; and like co|lours, may be blended &s;o perfectly toge|ther, that each of them may lo&s;e it&s;elf, and contribute only to vary that uniform im|pre&s;&s;ion, which ari&s;es from the whole. Some of the mo&s;t curious phaenomena of the hu|man mind are deriv'd from this property of the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>IN examining tho&s;e ingredients, which are capable of uniting with love and hatred, I begin to be &s;en&s;ible, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, of a misfortune, that has attended every &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy, with which the world has been yet acquainted. 'Tis commonly found, that in accounting for the operations of na|ture by any particular hypothe&s;is; among a number of experiments, that quadrate exactly with the principles we wou'd en|deavour to e&s;tabli&s;h; there is always &s;ome phaenomenon, which is more &s;tubborn, and will not &s;o ea&s;ily bend to our purpo&s;e. We need not be &s;urpriz'd, that this &s;hou'd hap|pen in natural philo&s;ophy. The e&s;&s;ence and compo&s;ition of external bodies are &s;o ob&s;cure, that we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, in our rea&s;onings, or rather conjectures concerning
<PB N="160" REF="166">
them, involve our&s;elves in contradictions and ab&s;urdities. But as the perceptions of the mind are perfectly known, and I have us'd all imaginable caution in forming conclu|&s;ions concerning them, I have always hop'd to keep clear of tho&s;e contradictions, which have attended every other &s;y&s;tem. Accord|ingly the difficulty, which I have at pre|&s;ent in my eye, is no-wi&s;e contrary to my &s;y&s;tem; but only departs a little from that &s;implicity, which has been hitherto its prin|cipal force and beauty.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ions of love and hatred are al|ways follow'd by, or rather conjoin'd with benevolence and anger. 'Tis this conjunc|tion, which chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hes the&s;e affec|tions from pride and humility. For pride and humility are pure emotions in the &s;oul, unattended with any de&s;ire, and not imme|diately exciting us to action. But love and hatred are not compleated within them|&s;elves, nor re&s;t in that emotion, which they produce, but carry the mind to &s;omething farther. Love is always follow'd by a de|&s;ire of the happine&s;s of the per&s;on belov'd, and an aver&s;ion to his mi&s;ery: As hatred produces a de&s;ire of the mi&s;ery and an a|ver&s;ion to the happine&s;s of the per&s;on hated. So remarkable a difference betwixt the&s;e two
<PB N="161" REF="167">
&s;ets of pa&s;&s;ions of pride and humility, love and hatred, which in &s;o many other parti|culars corre&s;pond to each other, merits our attention.</P>
<P>THE conjunction of this de&s;ire and a|ver&s;ion with love and hatred may be ac|counted for by two different hypothe&s;es. The fir&s;t is, that love and hatred have not only a <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> which excites them, <HI>viz.</HI> plea&s;ure and pain; and an <HI>object,</HI> to which they are directed, <HI>viz.</HI> a per&s;on or thinking being; but likewi&s;e an <HI>end,</HI> which they endeavour to attain, <HI>viz.</HI> the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of the per&s;on belov'd or hated; all which views, mixing together, make only one pa&s;|&s;ion. According to this &s;y&s;tem, love is no|thing but the de&s;ire of happine&s;s to another per&s;on, and hatred that of mi&s;ery. The de&s;ire and aver&s;ion con&s;titute the very na|ture of love and hatred. They are not on|ly in&s;eparable but the &s;ame.</P>
<P>BUT this is evidently contrary to expe|rience. For tho' 'tis certain we never love any per&s;on without de&s;iring his happine&s;s, nor hate any without wi&s;hing his mi&s;ery, yet the&s;e de&s;ires ari&s;e only upon the ideas of the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of our friend or enemy being pre&s;ented by the imagination,
<PB N="162" REF="168">
and are not ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to love and hatred. They are the mo&s;t obvious and na|tural &s;entiments of the&s;e affections, but not the only ones. The pa&s;&s;ions may expre&s;s them&s;elves in a hundred ways, and may &s;ub&s;i&s;t a con&s;iderable time, without our re|flecting on the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of their objects; which clearly proves, that the&s;e de|&s;ires are not the &s;ame with love and hatred, nor make any e&s;&s;ential part of them.</P>
<P>WE may, therefore, infer, that bene|volence and anger are pa&s;&s;ions different from love and hatred, and only conjoin'd with them, by the original con&s;titution of the mind. As nature has given to the body certain appetites and inclinations, which &s;he encrea&s;es, dimini&s;hes, or changes according to the &s;ituation of the fluids or &s;olids; &s;he has proceeded in the &s;ame manner with the mind. According as we are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with love or hatred, the corre&s;pondent de&s;ire of the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of the per|&s;on, who is the object of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, a|ri&s;es in the mind, and varies with each va|riation of the&s;e oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions. This or|der of things, ab&s;tractedly con&s;ider'd, is not nece&s;&s;ary. Love and hatred might have been unattended with any &s;uch de&s;ires, or
<PB N="163" REF="169">
their particular connexion might have been entirely revers'd. If nature had &s;o pleas'd, love might have had the &s;ame effect as ha|tred, and hatred as love. I &s;ee no contra|diction in &s;uppo&s;ing a de&s;ire of producing mi&s;ery annex'd to love, and of happine&s;s to hatred. If the &s;en&s;ation of the pa&s;&s;ion and de&s;ire be oppo&s;ite, nature cou'd have alter'd the &s;en&s;ation without altering the tendency of the de&s;ire, and by that means made them compatible with each other.</P>

<P>BUT tho' the de&s;ire of the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of others, according to the love or hatred we bear them, be an arbi|trary and original in&s;tinct implanted in our nature, we find it may be counterfeited on many occa&s;ions, and may ari&s;e from &s;econ|dary principles. <HI>Pity</HI> is a concern for, and <HI>malice</HI> a joy in the mi&s;ery of others, with|out any friend&s;hip or enmity to occa&s;ion this concern or joy. We pity even &s;trang|ers, and &s;uch as are perfectly indifferent to us: And if our ill-will to another proceed
<PB N="164" REF="170">
from any harm or injury, it is not, proper|ly &s;peaking, malice, but revenge. But if we examine the&s;e affections of pity and malice we &s;hall find them to be &s;econdary ones, ari&s;ing from original affections, which are varied by &s;ome particular turn of thought and imagination.</P>
<P>'TWILL be ea&s;y to explain the pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>pity,</HI> from the precedent rea&s;oning con|cerning <HI>&s;ympathy.</HI> We have a lively idea of every thing related to us. All human crea|tures are related to us by re&s;emblance. Their per&s;ons, therefore, their intere&s;ts, their pa&s;&s;ions, their pains and plea&s;ures mu&s;t &s;trike upon us in a lively manner, and produce an emotion &s;imilar to the original one; &s;ince a lively idea is ea&s;ily converted into an impre&s;&s;ion. If this be true in general, it mu&s;t be more &s;o of affliction and &s;orrow. The&s;e have always a &s;tronger and more la&s;ting influence than any plea&s;ure or enjoy|ment.</P>
<P>A SPECTATOR of a tragedy pa&s;&s;es thro' a long train of grief, terror, indignation, and other affections, which the poet repre|&s;ents in the per&s;ons he introduces. As many tragedies end happily, and no excel|lent one can be compos'd without &s;ome re|ver&s;es
<PB N="165" REF="171">
of fortune, the &s;pectator mu&s;t &s;ympa|thize with all the&s;e changes, and receive the fictitious joy as well as every other pa&s;|&s;ion. Unle&s;s, therefore, it be a&s;&s;erted, that every di&s;tinct pa&s;&s;ion is communicated by a di&s;tinct original quality, and is not deriv'd from the general principle of &s;ympathy a|bove-explain'd, it mu&s;t be allow'd, that all of them ari&s;e from that principle. To ex|cept any one in particular mu&s;t appear high|ly unrea&s;onable. As they are all fir&s;t pre|&s;ent in the mind of one per&s;on, and after|wards appear in the mind of another; and as the manner of their appearance, fir&s;t as an idea, then as an impre&s;&s;ion, is in every ca&s;e the &s;ame, the tran&s;ition mu&s;t ari&s;e from the &s;ame principle. I am at lea&s;t &s;ure, that this method of rea&s;oning wou'd be con&s;ider'd as certain, either in natural philo|&s;ophy or common life.</P>
<P>ADD to this, that pity depends, in a great mea&s;ure, on the contiguity, and even &s;ight of the object; which is a proof, that 'tis deriv'd from the imagination. Not to mention that women and children are mo&s;t &s;ubject to pity, as being mo&s;t guided by that faculty. The &s;ame infirmity, which makes them faint at the &s;ight of a naked
<PB N="166" REF="172">
&s;word, tho' in the hands of their be&s;t friend, makes them pity extremely tho&s;e, whom they find in any grief or affliction. Tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who derive this pa&s;&s;ion from I know not what &s;ubtile reflections on the in&s;tability of fortune, and our being liable to the &s;ame mi&s;eries we behold, will find this ob&s;ervation contrary to them among a great many others, which it were ea&s;y to produce.</P>
<P>THERE remains only to take notice of a pretty remarkable phaenomenon of this pa&s;&s;ion; which is, that the communicated pa&s;&s;ion of &s;ympathy &s;ometimes acquires &s;trength from the weakne&s;s of its original, and even ari&s;es by a tran&s;ition from affec|tions, which have no exi&s;tence. Thus when a per&s;on obtains any honourable office, or inherits a great fortune, we are always the more rejoic'd for his pro&s;perity, the le&s;s &s;en&s;e he &s;eems to have of it, and the great|er equanimity and indifference he &s;hews in its enjoyment. In like manner a man, who is not dejected by misfortunes, is the more lamented on account of his patience; and if that virtue extends &s;o far as utterly to remove all &s;en&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s, it &s;till farther encrea&s;es our compa&s;&s;ion. When a per&s;on of merit
<PB N="167" REF="173">
falls into what is vulgarly e&s;teem'd a great misfortune, we form a notion of his con|dition; and carrying our fancy from the cau&s;e to the u&s;ual effect, fir&s;t conceive a lively idea of his &s;orrow, and then feel an impre&s;&s;ion of it, entirely over-looking that greatne&s;s of mind, which elevates him a|bove &s;uch emotions, or only con&s;idering it &s;o far as to encrea&s;e our admiration, love and tenderne&s;s for him. We find from ex|perience, that &s;uch a degree of pa&s;&s;ion is u&s;ually connected with &s;uch a misfortune; and tho' there be an exception in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e, yet the imagination is affected by the <HI>general rule,</HI> and makes us conceive a live|ly idea of the pa&s;&s;ion, or rather feel the pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, in the &s;ame manner, as if the per&s;on were really actuated by it. From the &s;ame principles we blu&s;h for the con|duct of tho&s;e, who behave them&s;elves fool|i&s;hly before us; and that tho' they &s;hew no &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, nor &s;eem in the lea&s;t con&s;cious of their folly. All this proceeds from &s;ympathy; but 'tis of a partial kind, and views its objects only on one &s;ide, with|out con&s;idering the other, which has a con|trary effect, and wou'd entirely de&s;troy that emotion, which ari&s;es from the fir&s;t appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="174">
WE have al&s;o in&s;tances, wherein an in|difference and in&s;en&s;ibility under misfortune encrea&s;es our concern for the misfortunate, even tho' the indifference proceed not from any virtue and magnanimity. 'Tis an ag|gravation of a murder, that it was committed upon per&s;ons a&s;leep and in perfect &s;ecurity; as hi&s;torians readily ob&s;erve of any infant prince, who is captive in the hands of his enemies, that he is more worthy of com|pa&s;&s;ion the le&s;s &s;en&s;ible he is of his mi&s;erable condition. As we our&s;elves are here ac|quainted with the wretched &s;ituation of the per&s;on, it gives us a lively idea and &s;en&s;ation of &s;orrow, which is the pa&s;&s;ion that <HI>gene|rally</HI> attends it; and this idea becomes &s;till more lively, and the &s;en&s;ation more violent by a contra&s;t with that &s;ecurity and indif|ference, which we ob&s;erve in the per&s;on him|&s;elf. A contra&s;t of any kind never fails to affect the imagination, e&s;pecially when pre|&s;ented by the &s;ubject; and 'tis on the ima|gination that pity entirely depends <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To prevent all ambiguity, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that where I oppo&s;e the imagination to the memory, I mean in gene|ral the faculty that pre&s;ents our fainter ideas.

<P>WE mu&s;t now proceed to account for the pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>malice,</HI> which imi|tates the effects of hatred, as pity does tho&s;e of love; and gives us a joy in the &s;ufferings and mi&s;eries of others, without any offence or injury on their part.</P>
<P>So little are men govern'd by rea&s;on in their &s;entiments and opinions, that they al|ways judge more of objects by compari&s;on than from their intrin&s;ic worth and value. When the mind con&s;iders, or is accu&s;tom'd to, any degree of perfection, whatever falls &s;hort of it, tho' really e&s;teemable, has not|with&s;tanding the &s;ame effect upon the pa&s;|&s;ions, as what is defective and ill. This is an <HI>original</HI> quality of the &s;oul, and &s;imilar to what we have every day experience of in our bodies. Let a man heat one hand and cool the other; the &s;ame water will, at the &s;ame time, &s;eem both hot and cold, ac|cording to the di&s;po&s;ition of the different organs. A &s;mall degree of any quality, &s;ucceeding a greater, produces the &s;ame &s;en|&s;ation,
<PB N="170" REF="176">
as if le&s;s than it really is, and even &s;ometimes as the oppo&s;ite quality. Any gentle pain, that follows a violent one, &s;eems as nothing, or rather becomes a plea&s;ure; as on the other hand a violent pain, &s;ucceed|ing a gentle one, is doubly grievous and un|ea&s;y.</P>
<P>THIS no one can doubt of with regard to our pa&s;&s;ions and &s;en&s;ations. But there may ari&s;e &s;ome difficulty with regard to our ideas and objects. When an object augments or dimini&s;hes to the eye or ima|gination from a compari&s;on with others, the image and idea of the object are &s;till the &s;ame, and are equally extended in the <HI>retina,</HI> and in the brain or organ of per|ception. The eyes refract the rays of light, and the optic nerves convey the images to the brain in the very &s;ame manner, whe|ther a great or &s;mall object has preceded; nor does even the imagination alter the di|men&s;ions of its object on account of a com|pari&s;on with others. The que&s;tion then is, how from the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion and the &s;ame idea we can form &s;uch different judgments concerning the &s;ame object, and at one time admire its bulk, and at another de&s;pi&s;e its littlene&s;s. This variation in our judgments
<PB N="171" REF="177">
mu&s;t certainly proceed from a variation in &s;ome perception; but as the variation lies not in the immediate impre&s;&s;ion or idea of the object, it mu&s;t lie in &s;ome other im|pre&s;&s;ion, that accompanies it.</P>
<P>IN order to explain this matter, I &s;hall ju&s;t touch upon two principles, one of which &s;hall be more fully explain'd in the pro|gre&s;s of this treati&s;e; the other has been already accounted for. I believe it may &s;afely be e&s;tabli&s;h'd for a general maxim, that no object is pre&s;ented to the &s;en&s;es, nor image form'd in the fancy, but what is accompany'd with &s;ome emotion or move|ment of &s;pirits proportion'd to it; and how|ever cu&s;tom may make us in&s;en&s;ible of this &s;en&s;ation, and cau&s;e us to confound it with the object or idea, 'twill be ea&s;y, by careful and exact experiments, to &s;eparate and di&s;tingui&s;h them. For to in&s;tance only in the ca&s;es of exten&s;ion and number; 'tis evident, that any very bulky object, &s;uch as the ocean, an extended plain, a va&s;t chain of mountains, a wide fore&s;t; or any very numerous collection of objects, &s;uch as an army, a fleet, a crowd, excite in the mind a &s;en&s;ible emotion; and that the admiration, which ari&s;es on the appearance of &s;uch ob|jects,
<PB N="172" REF="178">
is one of the mo&s;t lively plea&s;ures, which human nature is capable of enjoying. Now as this admiration encrea&s;es or di|mini&s;hes by the encrea&s;e or diminution of the objects, we may conclude, according to our foregoing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book I. Part III. Sect. 15.</NOTE> principles, that 'tis a com|pound effect, proceeding from the conjunc|tion of the &s;everal effects, which ari&s;e from each part of the cau&s;e. Every part, then, of exten&s;ion, and every unite of number has a &s;eparate emotion attending it, when con|ceiv'd by the mind; and tho' that emotion be not always agreeable, yet by its conjunc|tion with others, and by its agitating the &s;pirits to a ju&s;t pitch, it contributes to the production of admiration, which is always agreeable. If this be allow'd with re&s;pect to exten&s;ion and number, we can make no difficulty with re&s;pect to virtue and vice, wit and folly, riches and poverty, happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, and other objects of that kind, which are always attended with an evident emotion.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd principle I &s;hall take notice of is that of our adherence to <HI>general rules;</HI> which has &s;uch a mighty influence on the actions and under&s;tanding, and is able to
<PB N="173" REF="179">
impo&s;e on the very &s;en&s;es. When an object is found by experience to be always accom|pany'd with another; whenever the fir&s;t object appears, tho' chang'd in very mate|rial circum&s;tances; we naturally fly to the conception of the &s;econd, and form an idea of it in as lively and &s;trong a manner, as if we had infer'd its exi&s;tence by the ju&s;te&s;t and mo&s;t authentic conclu&s;ion of our un|der&s;tanding. Nothing can undeceive us, not even our &s;en&s;es, which, in&s;tead of cor|recting this fal&s;e judgment, are often per|verted by it, and &s;eem to authorize its er|rors.</P>
<P>THE conclu&s;ion I draw from the&s;e two principles, join'd to the influence of com|pari&s;on above-mention'd, is very &s;hort and deci&s;ive. Every object is attended with &s;ome emotion proportion'd to it; a great object with a great emotion, a &s;mall object with a &s;mall emotion. A great <HI>object,</HI> therefore, &s;ucceeding a &s;mall one makes a great <HI>emo|tion</HI> &s;ucceed a &s;mall one. Now a great e|motion &s;ucceeding a &s;mall one becomes &s;till greater, and ri&s;es beyond its ordinary pro|portion. But as there is a certain degree of an emotion, which commonly attends every magnitude of an object; when the emotion
<PB N="174" REF="180">
encrea&s;es, we naturally imagine that the ob|ject has likewi&s;e encreas'd. The effect con|veys our view to its u&s;ual cau&s;e, a certain degree of emotion to a certain magnitude of the object; nor do we con&s;ider, that compa|ri&s;on may change the emotion without changing any thing in the object. Tho&s;e, who are acquainted with the metaphy&s;ical part of optics, and know how we transfer the judgments and conclu&s;ions of the under|&s;tanding to the &s;en&s;es, will ea&s;ily conceive this whole operation.</P>
<P>BUT leaving this new di&s;covery of an impre&s;&s;ion, that &s;ecretly attends every idea; we mu&s;t at lea&s;t allow of that principle, from whence the di&s;covery aro&s;e, <HI>that ob|jects appear greater or le&s;s by a compari&s;on with others.</HI> We have &s;o many in&s;tances of this, that it is impo&s;&s;ible we can di&s;pute its veracity; and 'tis from this principle I de|rive the pa&s;&s;ions of malice and envy.</P>
<P>'TIS evident we mu&s;t receive a greater or le&s;s &s;atisfaction or unea&s;ine&s;s from reflect|ing on our own condition and circum&s;tances, in proportion as they appear more or le&s;s fortunate or unhappy, in proportion to the degrees of riches, and power, and merit, and reputation, which we think our&s;elves po&s;|&s;e&s;t
<PB N="175" REF="181">
of. Now as we &s;eldom judge of ob|jects from their intrin&s;ic value, but form our notions of them from a compari&s;on with other objects; it follows, that according as we ob&s;erve a greater or le&s;s &s;hare of happi|pine&s;s or mi&s;ery in others, we mu&s;t make an e&s;timate of our own, and feel a con&s;e|quent pain or plea&s;ure. The mi&s;ery of an|other gives us a more lively idea of our hap|pine&s;s, and his happine&s;s of our mi&s;ery. The former, therefore, produces delight; and the latter unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>HERE then is a kind of pity rever&s;t, or contrary &s;en&s;ations ari&s;ing in the beholder, from tho&s;e which are felt by the per&s;on, whom he con&s;iders. In general we may ob&s;erve, that in all kinds of compari&s;on an object makes us always receive from another, to which it is compar'd, a &s;en&s;ation contrary to what ari&s;es from it&s;elf in its direct and immediate &s;urvey. A &s;mall object makes a great one appear &s;till greater. A great ob|ject makes a little one appear le&s;s. Defor|mity of it&s;elf produces unea&s;ine&s;s; but makes us receive new plea&s;ure by its contra&s;t with a beautiful object, who&s;e beauty is augment|ed by it; as on the other hand, beauty, which of it&s;elf produces plea&s;ure, makes us receive
<PB N="176" REF="182">
a new pain by the contra&s;t with any thing ugly, who&s;e deformity it augments. The ca&s;e, therefore, mu&s;t be the &s;ame with hap|pine&s;s and mi&s;ery. The direct &s;urvey of an|other's plea&s;ure naturally gives us plea&s;ure, and therefore produces pain when com|par'd with our own. His pain, con&s;ider'd in it&s;elf, is painful to us, but augments the idea of our own happine&s;s, and gives us plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>NOR will it appear &s;trange, that we may feel a rever&s;t &s;en&s;ation from the happine&s;s and mi&s;ery of others; &s;ince we find the &s;ame compari&s;on may give us a kind of malice again&s;t our&s;elves, and make us rejoice for our pains, and grieve for our plea&s;ures. Thus the pro&s;pect of pa&s;t pain is agreeable, when we are &s;atisfy'd with our pre&s;ent condition; as on the other hand our pa&s;t plea&s;ures give us unea&s;ine&s;s, when we enjoy nothing at pre&s;ent equal to them. The compari&s;on be|ing the &s;ame, as when we reflect on the &s;entiments of others, mu&s;t be attended with the &s;ame effects.</P>
<P>NAY a per&s;on may extend this malice again&s;t him&s;elf, even to his pre&s;ent fortune, and carry it &s;o far as de&s;ignedly to &s;eek af|fliction, and encrea&s;e his pains and &s;orrows.
<PB N="177" REF="183">
This may happen upon two occa&s;ions. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Upon the di&s;tre&s;s and misfortune of a friend, or per&s;on dear to him. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Upon the feeling any remor&s;es for a crime, of which he has been guilty. 'Tis from the principle of compari&s;on that both the&s;e irregular appetites for evil ari&s;e. A per&s;on, who in|dulges him&s;elf in any plea&s;ure, while his friend lies under affliction, feels the reflected unea&s;ine&s;s from his friend more &s;en&s;ibly by a compari&s;on with the original plea&s;ure, which he him&s;elf enjoys. This contra&s;t, indeed, ought al&s;o to inliven the pre&s;ent plea&s;ure. But as grief is here &s;uppos'd to be the predominant pa&s;&s;ion, every addition falls to that &s;ide, and is &s;wallow'd up in it, with|out operating in the lea&s;t upon the contrary affection. 'Tis the &s;ame ca&s;e with tho&s;e penances, which men inflict on them&s;elves for their pa&s;t &s;ins and failings. When a criminal reflects on the puni&s;hment he de|&s;erves, the idea of it is magnify'd by a com|pari&s;on with his pre&s;ent ea&s;e and &s;atisfac|tion; which forces him, in a manner, to &s;eek unea&s;ine&s;s, in order to avoid &s;o di&s;agreeable a contra&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS rea&s;oning will account for the ori|gin of <HI>envy</HI> as well as of malice. The only
<PB N="178" REF="184">
difference betwixt the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions lies in this, that envy is excited by &s;ome pre&s;ent enjoy|ment of another, which by compari&s;on di|mini&s;hes our idea of our own: Whereas malice is the unprovok'd de&s;ire of producing evil to another, in order to reap a plea&s;ure from the compari&s;on. The enjoyment, which is the object of envy, is commonly &s;uperior to our own. A &s;uperiority naturally &s;eems to over&s;hade us, and pre&s;ents a di&s;agreeable compari&s;on. But even in the ca&s;e of an inferiority, we &s;till de&s;ire a greater di&s;tance, in order to augment &s;till more the idea of our&s;elf. When this di&s;tance dimini&s;hes, the compari&s;on is le&s;s to our advantage; and con&s;equently gives us le&s;s plea&s;ure, and is even di&s;agreeable. Hence ari&s;es that &s;pecies of envy, which men feel, when they per|ceive their inferiors approaching or overtak|ing them in the pur&s;uit of glory or hap|pine&s;s. In this envy we may &s;ee the effects of compari&s;on twice repeated. A man, who compares him&s;elf to his inferior, receives a plea&s;ure from the compari&s;on: And when the inferiority decrea&s;es by the elevation of the inferior, what &s;hou'd only have been a decrea&s;e of plea&s;ure, becomes a real pain, by a new compari&s;on with its preceding con|dition.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="185">
'TIS worthy of ob&s;ervation concern|ing that envy, which ari&s;es from a &s;uperi|ority in others, that 'tis not the great di&s;|proportion betwixt our&s;elf and another, which produces it; but on the contrary, our proximity. A common &s;oldier bears no &s;uch envy to his general as to his &s;ergeant or cor|poral; nor does an eminent writer meet with &s;o great jealou&s;y in common hackney &s;criblers, as in authors, that more nearly approach him. It may, indeed, be thought, that the greater the di&s;proportion is, the greater mu&s;t be the unea&s;ine&s;s from the compari&s;on. But we may con&s;ider on the other hand, that the great di&s;proportion cuts off the relation, and either keeps us from comparing our&s;elves with what is remote from us, or dimini&s;hes the effects of the compari&s;on. Re&s;emblance and proximity always produce a relation of ideas; and where you de&s;troy the&s;e ties, however other accidents may bring two ideas together; as they have no bond or connecting quality to join them in the ima|gination; 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they can remain long united, or have any con&s;iderable influ|ence on each other.</P>
<P>I HAVE ob&s;erv'd in con&s;idering the na|ture of ambition, that the great feel a double

plea&s;ure in authority from the compari&s;on of their own condition with that of their &s;laves; and that this compari&s;on has a double influence, becau&s;e 'tis natural, and pre&s;ented by the &s;ubject. When the fancy, in the compari&s;on of objects, pa&s;&s;es not ea&s;ily from the one object to the other, the action of the mind is, in a great mea&s;ure, broke, and the fancy, in con&s;idering the &s;econd object, begins, as it were, upon a new footing. The im|pre&s;&s;ion, which attends every object, &s;eems not greater in that ca&s;e by &s;ucceeding a le&s;s of the &s;ame kind; but the&s;e two impre&s;|&s;ions are di&s;tinct, and produce their di&s;tinct effects, without any communication toge|ther. The want of relation in the ideas breaks the relation of the impre&s;&s;ions, and by &s;uch a &s;eparation prevents their mutual operation and influence.</P>
<P>To confirm this we may ob&s;erve, that the proximity in the degree of merit is not alone &s;ufficient to give ri&s;e to envy, but mu&s;t be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by other relations. A poet is not apt to envy a philo&s;opher, or a poet of a different kind, of a different nation, or of a different age. All the&s;e differences prevent or weaken the compari&s;on, and con&s;equently the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="187">
THIS too is the rea&s;on, why all objects appear great or little, merely by a compa|ri&s;on with tho&s;e of the &s;ame &s;pecies. A mountain neither magnifies nor dimini&s;hes a hor&s;e in our eyes; but when a <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> and a <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> hor&s;e are &s;een together, the one appears greater and the other le&s;s, than when view'd apart.</P>
<P>FROM the &s;ame principle we may ac|count for that remark of hi&s;torians, that any party in a civil war always choo&s;e to call in a foreign enemy at any hazard rather than &s;ubmit to their fellow-citizens. <HI>Guic|ciardin</HI> applies this remark to the wars in <HI>Italy,</HI> where the relations betwixt the dif|ferent &s;tates are, properly &s;peaking, nothing but of name, language, and contiguity. Yet even the&s;e relations, when join'd with &s;u|periority, by making the compari&s;on more natural, make it likewi&s;e more grievous, and cau&s;e men to &s;earch for &s;ome other &s;uperi|ority, which may be attended with no re|lation, and by that means may have a le&s;s &s;en&s;ible influence on the imagination. The mind quickly perceives its &s;everal advan|tages and di&s;advantages; and finding its &s;i|tuation to be mo&s;t unea&s;y, where &s;uperiority is conjoin'd with other relations, &s;eeks its
<PB N="182" REF="188">
repo&s;e as much as po&s;&s;ible, by their &s;epara|tion, and by breaking that a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, which renders the compari&s;on &s;o much more natural and efficacious. When it can|not break the a&s;&s;ociation, it feels a &s;tronger de&s;ire to remove the &s;uperiority; and this is the rea&s;on why travellers are commonly &s;o lavi&s;h of their prai&s;es to the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> and <HI>Per|&s;ians,</HI> at the &s;ame time, that they depre|ciate tho&s;e neighbouring nations, which may &s;tand upon a foot of rival&s;hip with their native country.</P>
<P>THESE examples from hi&s;tory and com|mon experience are rich and curious; but we may find parallel ones in the arts, which are no le&s;s remarkable. Shou'd an author compo&s;e a treati&s;e, of which one part was &s;erious and profound, another light and hu|morous, every one wou'd condemn &s;o &s;trange a mixture, and wou'd accu&s;e him of the neglect of all rules of art and critici&s;m. The&s;e rules of art are founded on the qua|lities of human nature; and the quality of human nature, which requires a con&s;i&s;tency in every performance, is that which renders the mind incapable of pa&s;&s;ing in a mo|ment from one pa&s;&s;ion and di&s;po&s;ition to a quite different one. Yet this makes us
<PB N="183" REF="189">
not blame Mr. <HI>Prior</HI> for joining his <HI>Alma</HI> and his <HI>Solomon</HI> in the &s;ame volume; tho' that admirable poet has &s;ucceeded perfectly well in the gaiety of the one, as well as in the melancholy of the other. Even &s;up|po&s;ing the reader &s;hou'd peru&s;e the&s;e two compo&s;itions without any interval, he wou'd feel little or no difficulty in the change of pa&s;&s;ions: Why, but becau&s;e he con&s;iders the&s;e performances as entirely different, and by this break in the ideas, breaks the pro|gre&s;s of the affections, and hinders the one from influencing or contradicting the other?</P>
<P>AN heroic and burle&s;que de&s;ign, united in one picture, wou'd be mon&s;trous; tho' we place two pictures of &s;o oppo&s;ite a character in the &s;ame chamber, and even clo&s;e by each other, without any &s;cruple or difficulty.</P>
<P>IN a word, no ideas can affect each other, either by compari&s;on, or by the pa&s;|&s;ions they &s;eparately produce, unle&s;s they be united together by &s;ome relation, which may cau&s;e an ea&s;y tran&s;ition of the ideas, and con&s;equently of the emotions or impre&s;&s;ions, attending the ideas; and may pre&s;erve the one impre&s;&s;ion in the pa&s;&s;age of the ima|gination to the object of the other. This principle is very remarkable, becau&s;e it is

analogous to what we have ob&s;erv'd both concerning the <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> and the <HI>pa&s;|&s;ions.</HI> Suppo&s;e two objects to be pre&s;ented to me, which are not connected by any kind of relation. Suppo&s;e that each of the&s;e objects &s;eparately produces a pa&s;&s;ion; and that the&s;e two pa&s;&s;ions are in them&s;elves contrary: We find from experience, that the want of relation in the objects or ideas hinders the natural contrariety of the pa&s;&s;i|ons, and that the break in the tran&s;ition of the thought removes the affections from each other, and prevents their oppo&s;ition. 'Tis the &s;ame ca&s;e with compari&s;on; and from both the&s;e phaenomena we may &s;afely conclude, that the relation of ideas mu&s;t forward the tran&s;ition of impre&s;&s;ions; &s;ince its ab&s;ence alone is able to prevent it, and to &s;eparate what naturally &s;hou'd have operated upon each other.

<HEAD>SECT. IX. <HI>Of the mixture of benevolence and anger with compa&s;&s;ion and malice.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THUS we have endeavour'd to ac|count for <HI>pity</HI> and <HI>malice.</HI> Both the&s;e affections ari&s;e from the imagination, according to the light, in which it places its object. When our fancy con&s;iders directly the &s;entiments of others, and enters deep into them, it makes us &s;en&s;ible of all the pa&s;&s;ions it &s;urveys, but in a particular man|ner of grief or &s;orrow. On the contrary, when we compare the &s;entiments of others to our own, we feel a &s;en&s;ation directly op|po&s;ite to the original one, <HI>viz.</HI> a joy from the grief of others, and a grief from their joy. But the&s;e are only the fir&s;t founda|tions of the affections of pity and malice. Other pa&s;&s;ions are afterwards confounded with them. There is always a mixture of love or tenderne&s;s with pity, and of hatred or anger with malice. But it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;s'd, that this mixture &s;eems at fir&s;t &s;ight to be contradictory to my &s;y&s;tem. For as
<PB N="186" REF="192">
pity is an unea&s;ine&s;s, and malice a joy, ari|&s;ing from the mi&s;ery of others, pity &s;hou'd naturally, as in all other ca&s;es, produce ha|tred; and malice, love. This contradiction I endeavour to reconcile, after the following manner.</P>
<P>IN order to cau&s;e a tran&s;ition of pa&s;&s;ions, there is requir'd a double relation of im|pre&s;&s;ions and ideas, nor is one relation &s;uf|ficient to produce this effect. But that we may under&s;tand the full force of this double re|lation, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that 'tis not the pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ation alone or momentary pain or plea&s;ure, which determines the character of any pa&s;&s;ion, but the whole bent or ten|dency of it from the beginning to the end. One impre&s;&s;ion may be related to another, not only when their &s;en&s;ations are re&s;emb|ling, as we have all along &s;uppos'd in the preceding ca&s;es; but al&s;o when their im|pul&s;es or directions are &s;imilar and corre|&s;pondent. This cannot take place with re|gard to pride and humility; becau&s;e the&s;e are only pure &s;en&s;ations, without any direc|tion or tendency to action. We are, there|fore, to look for in&s;tances of this peculiar relation of impre&s;&s;ions only in &s;uch affec|tions, as are attended with a certain appe|tite
<PB N="187" REF="193">
or de&s;ire; &s;uch as tho&s;e of love and ha|tred.</P>
<P>BENEVOLENCE or the appetite, which attends love, is a de&s;ire of the happine&s;s of the per&s;on belov'd, and an aver&s;ion to his mi&s;ery; as anger or the appetite, which at|tends hatred, is a de&s;ire of the mi&s;ery of the per&s;on hated, and an aver&s;ion to his happi|ne&s;s. A de&s;ire, therefore, of the happine&s;s of another, and aver&s;ion to his mi&s;ery, are &s;imilar to benevolence; and a de&s;ire of his mi&s;ery and aver&s;ion to his happine&s;s are cor|re&s;pondent to anger. Now pity is a de&s;ire of happine&s;s to another, and aver&s;ion to his mi&s;ery; as malice is the contrary appetite. Pity, then, is related to benevolence; and malice to anger: And as benevolence has been already found to be connected with love, by a natural and original quality, and anger with hatred; 'tis by this chain the pa&s;&s;ions of pity and malice are connected with love and hatred.</P>
<P>THIS hypothe&s;is is founded on &s;uffi|cient experience. A man, who from any motives has entertain'd a re&s;olution of per|forming an action, naturally runs into eve|ry other view or motive, which may forti|fy that re&s;olution, and give it authority and
<PB N="188" REF="194">
influence on the mind. To confirm us in any de&s;ign, we &s;earch for motives drawn from intere&s;t, from honour, from duty. What wonder, then, that pity and benevo|lence, malice, and anger, being the &s;ame de&s;ires ari&s;ing from different principles, &s;hou'd &s;o totally mix together as to be un|di&s;tingui&s;hable? As to the connexion be|twixt benevolence and love, anger and ha|tred, being <HI>original</HI> and primary, it admits of no difficulty.</P>
<P>WE may add to this another experi|ment, <HI>viz.</HI> that benevolence and anger, and con&s;equently love and hatred, ari&s;e when our happine&s;s or mi&s;ery have any dependance on the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of another per&s;on, without any farther relation. I doubt not but this experiment will appear &s;o &s;ingular as to excu&s;e us for &s;topping a moment to con&s;ider it.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, that two per&s;ons of the &s;ame trade &s;hou'd &s;eek employment in a town, that is not able to maintain both, 'tis plain the &s;ucce&s;s of one is perfectly incompa|tible with that of the other, and that what|ever is for the intere&s;t of either is contrary to that of his rival, and &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> Sup|po&s;e again, that two merchants, tho' living
<PB N="189" REF="195">
in different parts of the world, &s;hou'd en|ter into co-partner&s;hip together, the advan|tage or lo&s;s of one becomes immediately the advantage or lo&s;s of his partner, and the &s;ame fortune nece&s;&s;arily attends both. Now 'tis evident, that in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, ha|tred always follows upon the contrariety of intere&s;ts; as in the &s;econd, love ari&s;es from their union. Let us con&s;ider to what prin|ciple we can a&s;cribe the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>'TIS plain they ari&s;e not from the dou|ble relations of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, if we regard only the pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ation. For take|ing the fir&s;t ca&s;e of rival&s;hip; tho' the plea&s;ure and advantage of an antagoni&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily cau&s;es my pain and lo&s;s, yet to counter-ballance this, his pain and lo&s;s cau&s;es my plea&s;ure and advantage; and &s;up|po&s;ing him to be un&s;ucce&s;sful, I may by this means receive from him a &s;uperior de|gree of &s;atisfaction. In the &s;ame manner the &s;ucce&s;s of a partner rejoices me, but then his misfortunes afflict me in an equal proportion; and 'tis ea&s;y to imagine, that the latter &s;entiment may in many ca&s;es pre|ponderate. But whether the fortune of a rival or partner be good or bad, I always hate the former and love the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="196">
THIS love of a partner cannot proceed from the relation or connexion betwixt us; in the &s;ame manner as I love a brother or countryman. A rival has almo&s;t as clo&s;e a relation to me as a partner. For as the plea&s;ure of the latter cau&s;es my plea&s;ure, and his pain my pain; &s;o the plea&s;ure of the for|mer cau&s;es my pain, and his pain my plea|&s;ure. The connexion, then, of cau&s;e and ef|fect is the &s;ame in both ca&s;es; and if in the one ca&s;e, the cau&s;e and effect has a far|ther relation of re&s;emblance, they have that of contrariety in the other; which, being al&s;o a &s;pecies of re&s;emblance, leaves the mat|ter pretty equal.</P>
<P>THE only explication, then, we can give of this phaenomenon is deriv'd from that principle of a parallel direction above|mention'd. Our concern for our own in|tere&s;t gives us a plea&s;ure in the plea&s;ure, and a pain in the pain of a partner, after the &s;ame manner as by &s;ympathy we feel a &s;en&s;ation corre&s;pondent to tho&s;e, which ap|pear in any per&s;on, who is pre&s;ent with us. On the other hand, the &s;ame concern for our intere&s;t makes us feel a pain in the plea&s;ure, and a plea&s;ure in the pain of a rival; and in &s;hort the &s;ame contrariety of
<PB N="191" REF="197">
&s;entiments as ari&s;es from compari&s;on and malice. Since, therefore, a parallel direc|tion of the affections, proceeding from in|tere&s;t, can give ri&s;e to benevolence or an|ger, no wonder the &s;ame parallel direction, deriv'd from &s;ympathy and from compari&s;on, &s;hou'd have the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>IN general we may ob&s;erve, that 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible to do good to others, from whatever motive, without feeling &s;ome touches of kindne&s;s and good-will towards 'em; as the injuries we do, not only cau&s;e hatred in the per&s;on, who &s;uffers them, but even in our&s;elves. The&s;e phaenomena, indeed, may in part be accounted for from other principles.</P>
<P>BUT here there occurs a con&s;iderable objection, which 'twill be nece&s;&s;ary to exa|mine before we proceed any farther. I have endeavour'd to prove, that power and riches, or poverty and meanne&s;s; which give ri&s;e to love or hatred, without producing any original plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s; operate upon us by means of a &s;econdary &s;en&s;ation de|riv'd from a &s;ympathy with that pain or &s;atisfaction, which they produce in the per|&s;on, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them. From a &s;ympa|thy with his plea&s;ure there ari&s;es love; from that with his unea&s;ine&s;s, hatred. But 'tis
<PB N="192" REF="198">
a maxim, which I have ju&s;t now e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd, and which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the explication of the phaenomena of pity and malice, <Q>That 'tis not the pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ation or momentary pain or plea&s;ure, which determines the character of any pa&s;&s;ion, but the general bent or tendency of it from the beginning to the end.</Q> For this rea&s;on, pity or a &s;ympathy with pain produces love, and that becau&s;e it in|tere&s;ts us in the fortunes of others, good or bad, and gives us a &s;econdary &s;en&s;ation cor|re&s;pondent to the primary; in which it has the &s;ame influence with love and benevo|lence. Since then this rule holds good in one ca&s;e, why does it not prevail through|out, and why does &s;ympathy in unea&s;ine&s;s ever produce any pa&s;&s;ion be&s;ide good-will and kindne&s;s? Is it becoming a philo&s;opher to alter his method of rea&s;oning, and run from one principle to its contrary, accord|ing to the particular phaenomenon, which he wou'd explain?</P>
<P>I HAVE mention'd two different cau&s;es, from which a tran&s;ition of pa&s;&s;ion may a|ri&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> a double relation of ideas and im|pre&s;&s;ions, and what is &s;imilar to it, a con|formity in the tendency and direction of any
<PB N="193" REF="199">
two de&s;ires, which ari&s;e from different prin|ciples. Now I a&s;&s;ert, that when a &s;ympa|thy with unea&s;ine&s;s is weak, it produces ha|tred or contempt by the former cau&s;e; when &s;trong, it produces love or tenderne&s;s by the latter. This is the &s;olution of the foregoing difficulty, which &s;eems &s;o urgent; and this is a principle founded on &s;uch e|vident arguments, that we ought to have e&s;tabli&s;h'd it, even tho' it were not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the explication of any phaenome|non.</P>
<P>'TIS certain, that &s;ympathy is not al|ways limited to the pre&s;ent moment, but that we often feel by communication the pains and plea&s;ures of others, which are not in being, and which we only an|ticipate by the force of imagination. For &s;uppo&s;ing I &s;aw a per&s;on perfectly unknown to me, who, while a&s;leep in the fields, was in danger of being trod under foot by hor&s;es, I &s;hou'd immediately run to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and in this I &s;hou'd be actuated by the &s;ame principle of &s;ympathy, which makes me concern'd for the pre&s;ent &s;orrows of a &s;tranger. The bare mention of this is &s;ufficient. Sympathy being nothing but a lively idea converted into an impre&s;&s;ion, 'tis
<PB N="194" REF="200">
evident, that, in con&s;idering the future po&s;|&s;ible or probable condition of any per&s;on, we may enter into it with &s;o vivid a con|ception as to make it our own concern; and by that means be &s;en&s;ible of pains and plea&s;ures, which neither belong to our&s;elves, nor at the pre&s;ent in&s;tant have any real ex|i&s;tence.</P>
<P>BUT however we may look forward to the future in &s;ympathizing with any per|&s;on, the extending of our &s;ympathy de|pends in a great mea&s;ure upon our &s;en&s;e of his pre&s;ent condition. 'Tis a great effort of imagination, to form &s;uch lively ideas even of the pre&s;ent &s;entiments of others as to feel the&s;e very &s;entiments; but 'tis impo&s;&s;ible we cou'd extend this &s;ympathy to the future, without being aided by &s;ome circum&s;tance in the pre&s;ent, which &s;trikes upon us in a live|ly manner. When the pre&s;ent mi&s;ery of another has any &s;trong influence upon me, the vivacity of the conception is not con|fin'd merely to its immediate object, but dif|fu&s;es its influence over all the related ideas, and gives me a lively notion of all the cir|cum&s;tances of that per&s;on, whether pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, or future; po&s;&s;ible, probable or certain. By means of this lively notion I
<PB N="195" REF="201">
am intere&s;ted in them; take part with them; and feel a &s;ympathetic motion in my brea&s;t, conformable to whatever I imagine in his. If I dimini&s;h the vivacity of the fir&s;t concep|tion, I dimini&s;h that of the related ideas; as pipes can convey no more water than what ari&s;es at the fountain. By this diminution I de&s;troy the future pro&s;pect, which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to intere&s;t me perfectly in the for|tune of another. I may feel the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, but carry my &s;ympathy no far|ther, and never transfu&s;e the force of the fir&s;t conception into my ideas of the related objects. If it be another's mi&s;ery, which is pre&s;ented in this feeble manner, I receive it by communication, and am affected with all the pa&s;&s;ions related to it: But as I am not &s;o much intere&s;ted as to concern my|&s;elf in his good fortune, as well as his bad, I never feel the exten&s;ive &s;ympathy, nor the pa&s;&s;ions related to <HI>it.</HI></P>
<P>NOW in order to know what pa&s;&s;ions are related to the&s;e different kinds of &s;ympathy, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that benevolence is an original plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the plea&s;ure of the per&s;on belov'd, and a pain proceeding from his pain: From which corre&s;pondence of impre&s;&s;ions there ari&s;es a &s;ub&s;equent de|&s;ire
<PB N="196" REF="202">
of his plea&s;ure, and aver&s;ion to his pain. In order, then, to make, a pa&s;&s;ion run parallel with benevolence, 'tis requi&s;ite we &s;hou'd feel the&s;e double impre&s;&s;ions, corre&s;pondent to tho&s;e of the per&s;on, whom we con&s;ider; nor is any one of them alone &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e. When we &s;ym|pathize only with one impre&s;&s;ion, and that a painful one, this &s;ympathy is related to anger and to hatred, upon account of the unea&s;ine&s;s it conveys to us. But as the ex|ten&s;ive or limited &s;ympathy depends upon the force of the fir&s;t &s;ympathy; it follows, that the pa&s;&s;ion of love or hatred depends upon the &s;ame principle. A &s;trong impre&s;|&s;ion, when communicated, gives a double tendency of the pa&s;&s;ions; which is related to benevolence and love by a &s;imilarity of direction; however painful the fir&s;t impre&s;|&s;ion might have been. A weak impre&s;&s;ion, that is painful, is related to anger and hatred by the re&s;emblance of &s;en&s;ations. Benevo|lence, therefore, ari&s;es from a great degree of mi&s;ery, or any degree &s;trongly &s;ympa|thiz'd with: Hatred or contempt from a &s;mall degree, or one weakly &s;ympathiz'd with; which is the principle I intended to prove and explain.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="203">
NOR have we only our rea&s;on to tru&s;t to for this principle, but al&s;o experience. A certain degree of poverty produces con|tempt; but a degree beyond cau&s;es compa&s;|&s;ion and good-will. We may under-value a pea&s;ant or &s;ervant; but when the mi&s;ery of a beggar appears very great, or is painted in very lively colours, we &s;ympathize with him in his afflictions, and feel in our heart evident touches of pity and benevolence. The &s;ame object cau&s;es contrary pa&s;&s;ions according to its different degrees. The pa&s;|&s;ions, therefore, mu&s;t depend upon princi|ples, that operate in &s;uch certain degrees, according to my hypothe&s;is. The encrea&s;e of the &s;ympathy has evidently the &s;ame ef|fect as the encrea&s;e of the mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>A BARREN or de&s;olate country always &s;eems ugly and di&s;agreeable, and common|ly in&s;pires us with contempt for the inha|bitants. This deformity, however, pro|ceeds in a great mea&s;ure from a &s;ympathy with the inhabitants, as has been already ob|&s;erv'd; but it is only a weak one, and reaches no farther than the immediate &s;en&s;ation, which is di&s;agreeable. The view of a city in a&s;hes conveys benevolent &s;entiments; be|cau&s;e we there enter &s;o deep into the inte|re&s;ts
<PB N="198" REF="204">
of the mi&s;erable inhabitants, as to wi&s;h for their pro&s;perity, as well as feel their ad|ver&s;ity.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the force of the impre&s;&s;ion ge|nerally produces pity and benevolence, 'tis certain, that by being carry'd too far it cea&s;es to have that effect. This, perhaps, may be worth our notice. When the unea&s;ine&s;s is either &s;mall in it&s;elf, or remote from us, it engages not the imagination, nor is able to convey an equal concern for the future and contingent good, as for the pre&s;ent and real evil. Upon its acquiring greater force, we become &s;o intere&s;ted in the concerns of the per&s;on, as to be &s;en&s;ible both of his good and bad fortune; and from that com|pleat &s;ympathy there ari&s;es pity and bene|volence. But 'twill ea&s;ily be imagin'd, that where the pre&s;ent evil &s;trikes with more than ordinary force, it may entirely en|gage our attention, and prevent that double &s;ympathy, above-mention'd. Thus we find, that tho' every one, but e&s;pecially women, are apt to contract a kindne&s;s for criminals, who go to the &s;caffold, and readily imagine them to be uncommonly hand&s;ome and well-&s;hap'd; yet one, who is pre&s;ent at the cruel execution of the
<PB N="199" REF="205">
rack, feels no &s;uch tender emotions; but is in a manner overcome with horror, and has no lei&s;ure to temper this unea&s;y &s;en&s;a|tion by any oppo&s;ite &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>BUT the in&s;tance, which makes the mo&s;t clearly for my hypothe&s;is, is that wherein by a change of the objects we &s;e|parate the double &s;ympathy even from a midling degree of the pa&s;&s;ion; in which ca&s;e we find, that pity, in&s;tead of producing love and tenderne&s;s as u&s;ual, always gives ri&s;e to the contrary affection. When we ob&s;erve a per&s;on in misfortunes, we are affected with pity and love; but the au|thor of that misfortune becomes the ob|ject of our &s;tronge&s;t hatred, and is the more dete&s;ted in proportion to the de|gree of our compa&s;&s;ion. Now for what rea&s;on &s;hou'd the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion of pity pro|duce love to the per&s;on, who &s;uffers the misfortune, and hatred to the per&s;on, who cau&s;es it; unle&s;s it be becau&s;e in the latter ca&s;e the author bears a relation only to the mis|fortune; whereas in con&s;idering the &s;uffer|er we carry our view on every &s;ide, and wi&s;h for his pro&s;perity, as well as are &s;en&s;i|ble of his affliction?</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="206">
I SHALL ju&s;t ob&s;erve, before I leave the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, that this phaenomenon of the double &s;ympathy, and its tendency to cau&s;e love, may contribute to the produc|tion of the kindne&s;s, which we naturally bear our relations and acquaintance. Cu&s;tom and relation make us enter deeply into the &s;entiments of others; and whatever fortune we &s;uppo&s;e to attend them, is render'd pre&s;ent to us by the imagination, and ope|rates as if originally our own. We re|joice in their plea&s;ures, and grieve for their &s;orrows, merely from the force of &s;ympathy. Nothing that concerns them is indifferent to us; and as this corre&s;pon|dence of &s;entiments is the natural atten|dant of love, it readily produces that af|fection.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. X. <HI>Of re&s;pect and contempt.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE now remains only to explain the pa&s;&s;ions of <HI>re&s;pect</HI> and <HI>contempt,</HI> along with the <HI>amorous</HI> affection, in order to under&s;tand all the pa&s;&s;ions which have any mixture of love or hatred. Let us be|gin with re&s;pect and contempt.</P>
<P>IN con&s;idering the qualities and circum|&s;tances of others, we may either regard them as they really are in them&s;elves; or may make a compari&s;on betwixt them and our own qualities and circum&s;tances; or may join the&s;e two methods of con&s;ideration. The good qualities of others, from the fir&s;t point of view, produce love; from the &s;e|cond, humility; and from the third, re&s;pect; which is a mixture of the&s;e two pa&s;&s;ions. Their bad qualities, after the &s;ame manner, cau&s;e either hatred, or pride, or contempt, according to the light in which we &s;urvey them.</P>
<P>THAT there is a mixture of pride in con|tempt, and of humility in re&s;pect, is, I think,
<PB N="202" REF="208">
too evident, from their very feeling or ap|pearance, to require any particular proof. That this mixture ari&s;es from a tacit com|pari&s;on of the per&s;on contemn'd or re&s;pected with our&s;elves is no le&s;s evident. The &s;ame man may cau&s;e either re&s;pect, love, or con|tempt by his condition and talents, accord|ing as the per&s;on, who con&s;iders him, from his inferior becomes his equal or &s;uperior. In changing the point of view, tho' the ob|ject may remain the &s;ame, its proportion to our&s;elves entirely alters; which is the cau&s;e of an alteration in the pa&s;&s;ions. The&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions, therefore, ari&s;e from our ob&s;erving the proportion; that is, from a compari&s;on.</P>
<P>I HAVE already ob&s;erv'd, that the mind has a much &s;tronger propen&s;ity to pride than to humility, and have endeavour'd, from the principles of human nature, to a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e for this phaenomenon. Whe|ther my rea&s;oning be receiv'd or not, the phaenomenon is undi&s;puted, and appears in many in&s;tances. Among the re&s;t, 'tis the rea&s;on why there is a much greater mixture of pride in contempt, than of humility in re&s;pect, and why we are more elevated with the view of one below us, than mortify'd with the pre&s;ence of one above us. Con|tempt
<PB N="203" REF="209">
or &s;corn has &s;o &s;trong a tincture of pride, that there &s;carce is any other pa&s;&s;ion di&s;cernable: Whereas in e&s;teem or re&s;pect, love makes a more con&s;iderable ingredient than humility. The pa&s;&s;ion of vanity is &s;o prompt, that it rouzes at the lea&s;t call; while humility requires a &s;tronger impul&s;e to make it exert it&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT here it may rea&s;onably be a&s;k'd, why this mixture takes place only in &s;ome ca&s;es, and appears not on every occa&s;ion. All tho&s;e objects, which cau&s;e love, when plac'd on another per&s;on, are the cau&s;es of pride, when transfer'd to our&s;elves; and con&s;e|quently ought to be cau&s;es of humility, as well as love, while they belong to others, and are only compar'd to tho&s;e, which we our&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;s. In like manner every qua|lity, which, by being directly con&s;ider'd, produces hatred, ought always to give ri&s;e to pride by compari&s;on, and by a mixture of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of hatred and pride ought to excite contempt or &s;corn. The difficulty then is, why any objects ever cau&s;e pure love or hatred, and produce not always the mixt pa&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect and contempt.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;uppos'd all along, that the pa&s;|&s;ions of love and pride, and tho&s;e of hu|mility
<PB N="204" REF="210">
and hatred are &s;imilar in their &s;en|&s;ations, and that the two former are always agreeable, and the two latter painful. But tho' this be univer&s;ally true, 'tis ob&s;ervable, that the two agreeable, as well as the two painful pa&s;&s;ions, have &s;ome differences, and even contrarieties, which di&s;tingui&s;h them. No|thing invigorates and exalts the mind equally with pride and vanity; tho' at the &s;ame time love or tenderne&s;s is rather found to weaken and infeeble it. The &s;ame diffe|rence is ob&s;ervable betwixt the unea&s;y pa&s;|&s;ions. Anger and hatred be&s;tow a new force on all our thoughts and actions; while humility and &s;hame deject and di&s;|courage us. Of the&s;e qualities of the pa&s;|&s;ions, 'twill be nece&s;&s;ary to form a di&s;tinct idea. Let us remember, that pride and hatred invigorate the &s;oul; and love and humility infeeble it.</P>
<P>FROM this it follows, that tho' the con|formity betwixt love and hatred in the a|greeablene&s;s of their &s;en&s;ation makes them always be excited by the &s;ame objects, yet this other contrariety is the rea&s;on, why they are excited in very different degrees. Genius and learning are <HI>plea&s;ant</HI> and <HI>mag|nificent</HI> objects, and by both the&s;e circum|&s;tances
<PB N="205" REF="211">
are adapted to pride and vanity; but have a relation to love by their plea&s;ure on|ly. Ignorance and &s;implicity are <HI>di&s;agree|able</HI> and <HI>mean,</HI> which in the &s;ame manner gives them a double connexion with hu|mility, and a &s;ingle one with hatred. We may, therefore, con&s;ider it as certain, that tho' the &s;ame object always produces love and pride, humility and hatred, ac|cording to its different &s;ituations, yet it &s;el|dom produces either the two former or the two latter pa&s;&s;ions in the &s;ame proportion.</P>
<P>'TIS here we mu&s;t &s;eek for a &s;olution of the difficulty above-mention'd, why any object ever excites pure love or hatred, and does not always produce re&s;pect or contempt, by a mixture of humility or pride. No quality in another gives ri&s;e to humility by compari&s;on, unle&s;s it wou'd have produc'd pride by being plac'd in our&s;elves; and <HI>vice ver&s;a</HI> no object excites pride by com|pari&s;on, unle&s;s it wou'd have produc'd humility by the direct &s;urvey. This is evi|dent, objects always produce by <HI>compari&s;on</HI> a &s;en&s;ation directly contrary to their <HI>origi|nal</HI> one. Suppo&s;e, therefore, an object to be pre&s;ented, which is peculiarly fitted to produce love, but imperfectly to excite pride;
<PB N="206" REF="212">
this object, belonging to another, gives ri&s;e directly to a great degree of love, but to a &s;mall one of humility by compari&s;on; and con&s;equently that latter pa&s;&s;ion is &s;carce felt in the compound, nor is able to convert the love into re&s;pect. This is the ca&s;e with good nature, good humour, facility, gene|ro&s;ity, beauty, and many other qualities. The&s;e have a peculiar aptitude to produce love in others; but not &s;o great a tendency to excite pride in our&s;elves: For which rea&s;on the view of them, as belonging to another per&s;on, produces pure love, with but a &s;mall mixture of humility and re&s;pect. 'Tis ea&s;y to extend the &s;ame rea&s;oning to the oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>BEFORE we leave this &s;ubject, it may not be ami&s;s to account for a pretty curious phaenomenon, <HI>viz.</HI> why we commonly keep at a di&s;tance &s;uch as we contemn, and al|low not our inferiors to approach too near even in place and &s;ituation. It has al|ready been ob&s;erv'd, that almo&s;t every kind of idea is attended with &s;ome emotion, even the ideas of number and exten&s;ion, much more tho&s;e of &s;uch objects as are e&s;teem'd of con&s;equence in life, and fix our attention. 'Tis not with entire indifference we can &s;ur|vey
<PB N="207" REF="213">
either a rich man or a poor one, but mu&s;t feel &s;ome faint touches, at lea&s;t, of re&s;pect in the former ca&s;e, and of contempt in the latter. The&s;e two pa&s;&s;ions are contrary to each other; but in order to make this contrariety be felt, the objects mu&s;t be &s;ome|way related; otherwi&s;e the affections are to|tally &s;eparate and di&s;tinct, and never en|counter. The relation takes place wherever the per&s;ons become contiguous; which is a general rea&s;on why we are unea&s;y at &s;ee|ing &s;uch di&s;proportion'd objects, as a rich man and a poor one, a nobleman and a porter, in that &s;ituation.</P>
<P>THIS unea&s;ine&s;s, which is common to every &s;pectator, mu&s;t be more &s;en&s;ible to the &s;uperior; and that becau&s;e the near approach of the inferior is regarded as a piece of ill|breeding, and &s;hews that he is not &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;proportion, and is no way affected by it. A &s;en&s;e of &s;uperiority in another breeds in all men an inclination to keep them&s;elves at a di&s;tance from him, and de|termines them to redouble the marks of re|&s;pect and reverence, when they are oblig'd to approach him; and where they do not ob&s;erve that conduct, 'tis a proof they are not &s;en&s;ible of his &s;uperiority. From hence
<PB N="208" REF="214">
too it proceeds, that any great <HI>difference</HI> in the degrees of any quality is call'd a <HI>di&s;tance</HI> by a common metaphor, which, however trivial it may appear, is founded on natural principles of the imagination. A great dif|ference inclines us to produce a di&s;tance. The ideas of di&s;tance and difference are, therefore, connected together. Connected ideas are readily taken for each other; and this is in general the &s;ource of the metaphor, as we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve after|wards.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XI. <HI>Of the amorous pa&s;&s;ion, or love be|twixt the &s;exes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OF all the compound pa&s;&s;ions, which proceed from a mixture of love and hatred with other affections, no one better de|&s;erves our attention, than that love, which ari&s;es betwixt the &s;exes, as well on account of its force and violence, as tho&s;e curious principles of philo&s;ophy, for which it af|fords us an unconte&s;table argument. 'Tis plain, that this affection, in its mo&s;t natu|ral
<PB N="209" REF="215">
&s;tate, is deriv'd from the conjunction of three different impre&s;&s;ions or pa&s;&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> The plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation ari&s;ing from beauty; the bodily appetite for generation; and a generous kindne&s;s or good-will. The origin of kindne&s;s from beauty may be explain'd from the foregoing rea&s;oning. The que&s;tion is how the bodily appetite is excited by it.</P>
<P>THE appetite of generation, when con|fin'd to a certain degree, is evidently of the plea&s;ant kind, and has a &s;trong connexion with all the agreeable emotions. Joy, mirth, vanity, and kindne&s;s are all incentives to this de&s;ire; as well as mu&s;ic, dancing, wine, and good cheer. On the other hand, &s;orrow, melancholy, poverty, humility are de&s;truc|tive of it. From this quality 'tis ea&s;ily con|ceiv'd why it &s;hou'd be connected with the &s;en&s;e of beauty.</P>
<P>BUT there is another principle that con|tributes to the &s;ame effect. I have ob&s;erv'd that the parallel direction of the de&s;ires is a real relation, and no le&s;s than a re&s;emblance in their &s;en&s;ation, produces a connexion among them. That we may fully com|prehend the extent of this relation, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that any principal de&s;ire may be
<PB N="210" REF="216">
attended with &s;ubordinate ones, which are connected with it, and to which if other de&s;ires are parallel, they are by that means related to the principal one. Thus hunger may oft be con&s;ider'd as the primary incli|nation of the &s;oul, and the de&s;ire of ap|proaching the meat as the &s;econdary one; &s;ince 'tis ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;atisfying that appetite. If an object, therefore, by any &s;eparate qualities, inclines us to approach the meat, it naturally encrea&s;es our appetite; as on the contrary, whatever inclines us to &s;et our victuals at a di&s;tance, is contradic|tory to hunger, and dimini&s;hes our inclina|tion to them. Now 'tis plain that beauty has the fir&s;t effect, and deformity the &s;e|cond: Which is the rea&s;on why the former gives us a keener appetite for our victuals, and the latter is &s;ufficient to di&s;gu&s;t us at the mo&s;t &s;avoury di&s;h, that cookery has invented. All this is ea&s;ily applicable to the appetite for generation.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e two relations, <HI>viz.</HI> re&s;emb|lance and a parallel de&s;ire, there ari&s;es &s;uch a connexion betwixt the &s;en&s;e of beauty, the bodily appetite, and benevolence, that they become in a manner in&s;eparable: And we find from experience, that 'tis in|different
<PB N="211" REF="217">
which of them advances fir&s;t; &s;ince any of them is almo&s;t &s;ure to be attended with the related affections. One, who is inflam'd with lu&s;t, feels at lea&s;t a momen|tary kindne&s;s towards the object of it, and at the &s;ame time fancies her more beautiful than ordinary; as there are many, who be|gin with kindne&s;s and e&s;teem for the wit and merit of the per&s;on, and advance from that to the other pa&s;&s;ions. But the mo&s;t common &s;pecies of love is that which fir&s;t ari&s;es from beauty, and afterwards diffu&s;es it&s;elf into kindne&s;s and into the bodily ap|petite. Kindne&s;s or e&s;teem, and the ap|petite to generation, are too remote to unite ea&s;ily together. The one is, per|haps, the mo&s;t refin'd pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul; the other the mo&s;t gro&s;s and vulgar. The love of beauty is plac'd in a ju&s;t medium betwixt them, and partakes of both their natures: From whence it proceeds, that 'tis &s;o &s;ingularly fitted to produce both.</P>
<P>THIS account of love is not peculiar to my &s;y&s;tem, but is unavoidable on any hy|pothe&s;is. The three affections, which com|po&s;e this pa&s;&s;ion, are evidently di&s;tinct, and has each of them its di&s;tinct object. 'Tis certain, therefore, that 'tis only by their re|lation
<PB N="212" REF="218">
they produce each other. But the relation of pa&s;&s;ions is not alone &s;ufficient. 'Tis likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary, there &s;hou'd be a relation of ideas. The beauty of one per|&s;on never in&s;pires us with love for another. This then is a &s;en&s;ible proof of the double relation of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas. From one in&s;tance &s;o evident as this we may form a judgment of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS may al&s;o &s;erve in another view to illu&s;trate what I have in&s;i&s;ted on concern|ing the origin of pride and humility, love and hatred. I have ob&s;erv'd, that tho' &s;elf be the object of the fir&s;t &s;et of pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ome other per&s;on of the &s;econd, yet the&s;e objects cannot alone be the cau&s;es of the pa&s;&s;ions; as having each of them a relation to two contrary affections, which mu&s;t from the very fir&s;t moment de&s;troy each other. Here then is the &s;ituation of the mind, as I have already de&s;crib'd it. It has certain organs naturally fitted to produce a pa&s;&s;ion; that pa&s;&s;ion, when produc'd, naturally turns the view to a certain object. But this not being &s;ufficient to produce the pa&s;&s;ion, there is requir'd &s;ome other emotion, which by a double relation of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas may &s;et the&s;e principles in action, and be|&s;tow
<PB N="213" REF="219">
on them their fir&s;t impul&s;e. This &s;i|tuation is &s;till more remarkable with regard to the appetite of generation. Sex is not only the object, but al&s;o the cau&s;e of the appetite. We not only turn our view to it, when actuated by that appetite; but the re|flecting on it &s;uffices to excite the appetite. But as this cau&s;e lo&s;es its force by too great frequency, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hou'd be quick|en'd by &s;ome new impul&s;e; and that im|pul&s;e we find to ari&s;e from the <HI>beauty</HI> of the <HI>per&s;on;</HI> that is, from a double relation of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas. Since this double relation is nece&s;&s;ary where an affection has both a di&s;tinct cau&s;e, and object, how much more &s;o, where it has only a di&s;tinct ob|ject, without any determinate cau&s;e?</P>

<P>BUT to pa&s;s from the pa&s;&s;ions of love and hatred, and from their mixtures and compo&s;itions, as they appear in man, to the &s;ame affections, as they di&s;play them|&s;elves
<PB N="214" REF="220">
in brutes; we may ob&s;erve, not on|ly that love and hatred are common to the whole &s;en&s;itive creation, but likewi&s;e that their cau&s;es, as above-explain'd, are of &s;o &s;imple a nature, that they may ea&s;ily be &s;uppos'd to operate on mere animals. There is no force of reflection or penetration re|quir'd. Every thing is conducted by &s;prings and principles, which are not peculiar to man, or any one &s;pecies of animals. The conclu&s;ion from this is obvious in favour of the foregoing &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>LOVE in animals, has not for its only object animals of the &s;ame &s;pecies, but ex|tends it&s;elf farther, and comprehends almo&s;t every &s;en&s;ible and thinking being. A dog naturally loves a man above his own &s;pe|cies, and very commonly meets with a re|turn of affection.</P>
<P>AS animals are but little &s;u&s;ceptible either of the plea&s;ures or pains of the imagina|tion, they can judge of objects only by the &s;en&s;ible good or evil, which they produce, and from <HI>that</HI> mu&s;t regulate their affections towards them. Accordingly we find, that by benefits or injuries we produce their love or hatred; and that by feeding and cheri&s;hing any animal, we quickly acquire
<PB N="215" REF="221">
his affections; as by beating and abu&s;ing him we never fail to draw on us his en|mity and ill-will.</P>
<P>LOVE in bea&s;ts is not caus'd &s;o much by relation, as in our &s;pecies; and that be|cau&s;e their thoughts are not &s;o active as to trace relations, except in very obvious in|&s;tances. Yet 'tis ea&s;y to remark, that on &s;ome occa&s;ions it has a con&s;iderable influ|ence upon them. Thus acquaintance, which has the &s;ame effect as relation, always pro|duces love in animals either to men or to each other. For the &s;ame rea&s;on any like|ne&s;s among them is the &s;ource of affection. An ox confin'd to a park with hor&s;es, will naturally join their company, if I may &s;o &s;peak, but always leaves it to enjoy that of his own &s;pecies, where he has the choice of both.</P>
<P>THE affection of parents to their young proceeds from a peculiar in&s;tinct in ani|mals, as well as in our &s;pecies.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that <HI>&s;ympathy,</HI> or the com|munication of pa&s;&s;ions, takes place among animals, no le&s;s than among men. Fear, an|ger, courage and other affections are fre|quently communicated from one animal to another, without their knowledge of that
<PB N="216" REF="222">
cau&s;e, which produc'd the original pa&s;|&s;ion. Grief likewi&s;e is receiv'd by &s;ym|pathy; and produces almo&s;t all the &s;ame con&s;equences, and excites the &s;ame emo|tions as in our &s;pecies. The howlings and lamentations of a dog produce a &s;en&s;ible concern in his fellows. And 'tis remark|able, that tho' almo&s;t all animals u&s;e in play the &s;ame member, and nearly the &s;ame action as in fighting; a lion, a tyger, a cat their paws; an ox his horns; a dog his teeth; a hor&s;e his heels: Yet they mo&s;t carefully avoid harming their companion, even tho' they have nothing to fear from his re&s;entment; which is an evident proof of the &s;en&s;e brutes have of each other's pain and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>EVERY one has ob&s;erv'd how much more dogs are animated when they hunt in a pack, than when they pur&s;ue their game apart; and 'tis evident this can pro|ceed from nothing but from &s;ympathy. 'Tis al&s;o well known to hunters, that this effect follows in a greater degree, and even in too great a degree, where two packs, that are &s;trangers to each other, are join'd together. We might, perhaps, be at a lo&s;s to explain this phaenomenon, if we
<PB N="217" REF="223">
had not experience of a &s;imilar in our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>ENVY and malice are pa&s;&s;ions very re|markable in animals. They are perhaps more common than pity; as requiring le&s;s effort of thought and imagination.</P>

<PB N="220" REF="225">
its nature and properties, is nece&s;&s;ary to the explanation of them, we &s;hall here make it the &s;ubject of our enquiry. I de|&s;ire it may be ob&s;erv'd, that by the <HI>will,</HI> I mean nothing but <HI>the internal impre&s;&s;ion we feel and are con&s;cious of, when we knowing|ly give ri&s;e to any new motion of our body, or new preception of our mind.</HI> This impre&s;|&s;ion, like the preceding ones of pride and humility, love and hatred, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to define, and needle&s;s to de&s;cribe any farther; for which rea&s;on we &s;hall cut off all tho&s;e definitions and di&s;tinctions, with which phi|lo&s;ophers are wont to perplex rather than clear up this que&s;tion; and entering at fir&s;t upon the &s;ubject, &s;hall examine that long di&s;puted que&s;tion concerning <HI>liberty and ne|ce&s;&s;ity;</HI> which occurs &s;o naturally in treating of the will.</P>
<P>'TIS univer&s;ally acknowledg'd, that the operations of external bodies are nece&s;&s;ary, and that in the communication of their mo|tion, in their attraction, and mutual cohe|&s;ion, there are not the lea&s;t traces of indif|ference or liberty. Every object is deter|min'd by an ab&s;olute fate to a certain de|gree and direction of its motion, and can no more depart from that preci&s;e line, in which
<PB N="221" REF="226">
it moves, than it can convert it&s;elf into an angel, or &s;pirit, or any &s;uperior &s;ub&s;tance. The actions, therefore, of matter are to be re|garded as in&s;tances of nece&s;&s;ary actions; and whatever is in this re&s;pect on the &s;ame footing with matter, mu&s;t be acknowledg'd to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary. That we may know whether this be the ca&s;e with the actions of the mind, we &s;hall begin with examining matter, and con&s;idering on what the idea of a nece&s;&s;ity in its operations are founded, and why we conclude one body or action to be the in|fallible cau&s;e of another.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erv'd already, that in no &s;ingle in&s;tance the ultimate connexion of any objects is di&s;coverable, either by our &s;en&s;es or rea&s;on, and that we can never penetrate &s;o far into the e&s;&s;ence and con|&s;truction of bodies, as to perceive the prin|ciple, on which their mutual influence de|pends. 'Tis their con&s;tant union alone, with which we are acquainted; and 'tis from the con&s;tant union the nece&s;&s;ity ari&s;es. If objects had not an uniform and regular conjunction with each other, we &s;hou'd never arrive at any idea of cau&s;e and effect; and even after all, the nece&s;&s;ity, which en|ters into that idea, is nothing but a determi|nation
<PB N="222" REF="227">
of the mind to pa&s;s from one object to its u&s;ual attendant, and infer the exi&s;|tence of one from that of the other. Here then are two particulars, which we are to con&s;ider as e&s;&s;ential to nece&s;&s;ity, <HI>viz.</HI> the con&s;tant <HI>union</HI> and the <HI>inference</HI> of the mind; and wherever we di&s;cover the&s;e we mu&s;t acknowledge a nece&s;&s;ity. As the actions of matter have no nece&s;&s;ity, but what is deriv'd from the&s;e circum&s;tances, and it is not by any in&s;ight into the e&s;&s;ence of bodies we di&s;cover their connexion, the ab&s;ence of this in&s;ight, while the union and inference remain, will never, in any ca&s;e, remove the nece&s;&s;ity. 'Tis the ob&s;ervation of the union, which produces the infe|rence; for which rea&s;on it might be thought &s;ufficient, if we prove a con&s;tant union in the actions of the mind, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h the inference, along with the nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e actions. But that I may be&s;tow a greater force on my rea&s;oning, I &s;hall examine the&s;e particulars apart, and &s;hall fir&s;t prove from experience, that our actions have a con&s;tant union with our mo|tives, tempers, and circum&s;tances, before I con&s;ider the inferences we draw from it.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="228">
To this end a very &s;light and gene|ral view of the common cour&s;e of human affairs will be &s;ufficient. There is no light, in which we can take them, that does not confirm this principle. Whether we con&s;i|der mankind according to the difference of &s;exes, ages, governments, conditions, or methods of education; the &s;ame uniformi|ty and regular operation of natural princi|ples are di&s;cernible. Like cau&s;es &s;till pro|duce like effects; in the &s;ame manner as in the mutual action of the elements and powers of nature.</P>
<P>THERE are different trees, which regu|larly produce fruit, who&s;e reli&s;h is different from each other; and this regularity will be admitted as an in&s;tance of nece&s;&s;ity and cau&s;es in external bodies. But are the pro|ducts of <HI>Guienne</HI> and of <HI>Champagne</HI> more regularly different than the &s;entiments, ac|tions, and pa&s;&s;ions of the two &s;exes, of which the one are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by their force and maturity, the other by their delicacy and &s;oftne&s;s?</P>
<P>ARE the changes of our body from in|fancy to old age more regular and certain than tho&s;e of our mind and conduct? And wou'd a man be more ridiculous, who
<PB N="224" REF="229">
wou'd expect that an infant of four years old will rai&s;e a weight of three hundred pound, than one, who from a per&s;on of the &s;ame age, wou'd look for a philo&s;o|phical rea&s;oning, or a prudent and well|concerted action?</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t certainly allow, that the co|he&s;ion of the parts of matter ari&s;es from na|tural and nece&s;&s;ary principles, whatever dif|ficulty we may find in explaining them: And for a like rea&s;on we mu&s;t allow, that human &s;ociety is founded on like principles; and our rea&s;on in the latter ca&s;e, is better than even that in the former; becau&s;e we not only ob&s;erve, that men <HI>always</HI> &s;eek &s;o|ciety, but can al&s;o explain the principles, on which this univer&s;al propen&s;ity is founded. For is it more certain, that two flat pieces of marble will unite together, than that two young &s;avages of different &s;exes will copu|late? Do the children ari&s;e from this copu|lation more uniformly, than does the pa|rents care for their &s;afety and pre&s;ervation? And after they have arriv'd at years of di&s;|cretion by the care of their parents, are the inconveniencies attending their &s;eparation more certain than their fore&s;ight of the&s;e
<PB N="225" REF="230">
inconveniencies, and their care of avoiding them by a clo&s;e union and confederacy?</P>
<P>THE &s;kin, pores, mu&s;cles, and nerves of a day-labourer are different from tho&s;e of a man of quality: So are his &s;entiments, ac|tions and manners. The different &s;tations of life influence the whole fabric, external and internal; and the&s;e different &s;tations a|ri&s;e nece&s;&s;arily, becau&s;e uniformly, from the nece&s;&s;ary and uniform principles of hu|man nature. Men cannot live without &s;o|ciety, and cannot be a&s;&s;ociated without go|vernment. Government makes a di&s;tinction of property, and e&s;tabli&s;hes the different ranks of men. This produces indu&s;try, traffic, manufactures, law-&s;uits, war, leagues, alliances, voyages, travels, cities, fleets, ports, and all tho&s;e other actions and ob|jects, which cau&s;e &s;uch a diver&s;ity, and at the &s;ame time maintain &s;uch an uniformity in human life.</P>
<P>SHOU'D a traveller, returning from a far country, tell us, that he had &s;een a climate in the fiftieth degree of northern latitude, where all the fruits ripen and come to per|fection in the winter, and decay in the &s;ummer, after the &s;ame manner as in <HI>Eng|land</HI> they are produc'd and decay in the
<PB N="226" REF="231">
contrary &s;ea&s;ons, he wou'd find few &s;o credulous as to believe him. I am apt to think a travellar wou'd meet with as little credit, who &s;hou'd inform us of people ex|actly of the &s;ame character with tho&s;e in <HI>Plato</HI>'s republic on the one hand, or tho&s;e in <HI>Hobbes</HI>'s <HI>Leviathan</HI> on the other. There is a general cour&s;e of nature in human ac|tions, as well as in the operations of the &s;un and the climate. There are al&s;o characters peculiar to different nations and particular per&s;ons, as well as common to mankind. The knowledge of the&s;e cha|racters is founded on the ob&s;ervation of an uniformity in the actions, that flow from them; and this uniformity forms the very e&s;&s;ence of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>I CAN imagine only one way of eluding this argument, which is by denying that uniformity of human actions, on which it is founded. As long as actions have a con|&s;tant union and connexion with the &s;itua|tion and temper of the agent, however we may in words refu&s;e to acknowledge the nece&s;&s;ity, we really allow the thing. Now &s;ome may, perhaps, find a pretext to deny this regular union and connexion. For what is more capricious than human ac|tions?
<PB N="227" REF="232">
What more incon&s;tant than the de&s;ires of man? And what creature departs more widely, not only from right rea&s;on, but from his own character and di&s;po&s;ition? An hour, a moment is &s;ufficient to make him change from one extreme to another, and overturn what co&s;t the greate&s;t pain and labour to e&s;tabli&s;h. Nece&s;&s;ity is regular and certain. Human conduct is irregular and uncertain. The one, therefore, pro|ceeds not from the other.</P>
<P>TO this I reply, that in judging of the actions of men we mu&s;t proceed upon the &s;ame maxims, as when we rea&s;on concerning ex|ternal objects. When any phaenomena are con&s;tantly and invariably conjoin'd together, they acquire &s;uch a connexion in the ima|gination, that it pa&s;&s;es from one to the o|ther, without any doubt or he&s;itation. But below this there are many inferior degrees of evidence and probability, nor does one &s;ingle contrariety of experiment entirely de&s;troy all our rea&s;oning. The mind ballances the contrary experiments, and deducting the inferior from the &s;uperior, proceeds with that degree of a&s;&s;urance or evidence, which remains. Even when the&s;e contrary expe|riments are entirely equal, we remove not
<PB N="228" REF="233">
the notion of cau&s;es and nece&s;&s;ity; but &s;up|po&s;ing that the u&s;ual contrariety proceeds from the operation of contrary and con|ceal'd cau&s;es, we conclude, that the chance or indifference lies only in our judgment on account of our imperfect knowledge, not in the things them&s;elves, which are in eve|ry ca&s;e equally nece&s;&s;ary, tho' to appear|ance not equally con&s;tant or certain. No union can be more con&s;tant and certain, than that of &s;ome actions with &s;ome motives and characters; and if in other ca&s;es the union is uncertain, 'tis no more than what happens in the operations of body, nor can we conclude any thing from the one irre|gularity, which will not follow equally from the other.</P>
<P>'TIS commonly allow'd that mad-men have no liberty. But were we to judge by their actions, the&s;e have le&s;s regularity and con&s;tancy than the actions of wi&s;e|men, and con&s;equently are farther remov'd from nece&s;&s;ity. One way of thinking in this particular is, therefore, ab&s;olutely in|con&s;i&s;tent; but is a natural con&s;equence of the&s;e confus'd ideas and undefin'd terms, which we &s;o commonly make u&s;e of in
<PB N="229" REF="234" MS="y">
our rea&s;onings, e&s;pecially on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t now &s;hew, that as the <HI>union</HI> betwixt motives and actions has the &s;ame con&s;tancy, as that in any natural operations, &s;o its influence on the under&s;tanding is al&s;o the &s;ame, in <HI>determining</HI> us to infer the ex|i&s;tence of one from that of another. If this &s;hall appear, there is no known circum|&s;tance, that enters into the connexion and production of the actions of matter, that is not to be found in all the operations of the mind; and con&s;equently we cannot, with|out a manife&s;t ab&s;urdity, attribute nece&s;&s;ity to the one, and refu&s;e it to the other.</P>
<P>THERE is no philo&s;opher, who&s;e judg|ment is &s;o riveted to this fanta&s;tical &s;y&s;tem of liberty, as not to acknowledge the force of <HI>moral evidence,</HI> and both in &s;peculation and proceed upon it, as upon a rea&s;onable foun|dation. Now moral evidence is nothing but a conclu&s;ion concerning the actions of men, deriv'd from the con&s;ideration of their motives, temper and &s;ituation. Thus when we &s;ee certain characters or figures de&s;crib'd upon paper, we infer that the per&s;on, who produc'd them, wou'd affirm &s;uch facts, the death of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> the &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI>
<PB N="230" REF="235">
the cruelty of <HI>Nero;</HI> and remembring ma|ny other concurrent te&s;timonies we con|clude, that tho&s;e facts were once really exi&s;tent, and that &s;o many men, without any intere&s;t, wou'd never con&s;pire to de|ceive us; e&s;pecially &s;ince they mu&s;t, in the attempt, expo&s;e them&s;elves to the deri|&s;ion of all their contemporaries, when the&s;e facts were a&s;&s;erted to be recent and univer|&s;ally known. The &s;ame kind of rea&s;oning runs thro' politics, war, commerce, oeco|nomy, and indeed mixes it&s;elf &s;o entirely in human life, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to act or &s;ub&s;i&s;t a moment without having recour&s;e to it. A prince, who impo&s;es a tax upon his &s;ubjects, expects their compliance. A general, who conducts an army, makes ac|count of a certain degree of courage. A merchant looks for fidelity and &s;kill in his factor or &s;uper-cargo. A man, who gives orders for his dinner, doubts not of the o|bedience of his &s;ervants. In &s;hort, as no|thing more nearly intere&s;ts us than our own actions and tho&s;e of others, the greate&s;t part of our rea&s;onings is employ'd in judgments concerning them. Now I a&s;&s;ert, that whoever rea&s;ons after this manner, does <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> be|lieve the actions of the will to ari&s;e from
<PB N="231" REF="236">
nece&s;&s;ity, and that he knows not what he means, when he denies it.</P>
<P>ALL tho&s;e objects, of which we call the one <HI>cau&s;e</HI> and the other <HI>effect,</HI> con&s;ider'd in them&s;elves, are as di&s;tinct and &s;eparate from each other, as any two things in nature, nor can we ever, by the mo&s;t accurate &s;urvey of them, infer the exi&s;tence of the one from that of the other. 'Tis only from experi|ence and the ob&s;ervation of their con&s;tant union, that we are able to form this infe|rence; and even after all, the inference is nothing but the effects of cu&s;tom on the imagination. We mu&s;t not here be content with &s;aying, that the idea of cau&s;e and ef|fect ari&s;es from objects con&s;tantly united; but mu&s;t affirm, that 'tis the very &s;ame with the idea of the&s;e objects, and that the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary connexion</HI> is not di&s;cover'd by a conclu&s;ion of the under&s;tanding, but is mere|ly a perception of the mind. Wherever, therefore, we ob&s;erve the &s;ame union, and wherever the union operates in the &s;ame manner upon the belief and opinion, we have the idea of cau&s;es and nece&s;&s;ity, tho' perhaps we may avoid tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions. Motion in one body in all pa&s;t in&s;tances, that have fallen under our ob&s;ervation, is
<PB N="232" REF="237">
follow'd upon impul&s;e by motion in ano|ther. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for the mind to pene|trate farther. From this con&s;tant union it <HI>forms</HI> the idea of cau&s;e and effect, and by its influence <HI>feels</HI> the nece&s;&s;ity. As there is the &s;ame con&s;tancy, and the &s;ame influence in what we call moral evidence, I a&s;k no more. What remains can only be a di&s;|pute of words.</P>
<P>AND indeed, when we con&s;ider how aptly <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> evidence cement together, and form only one chain of ar|gument betwixt them, we &s;hall make no &s;cruple to allow, that they are of the &s;ame nature, and deriv'd from the &s;ame principles. A pri&s;oner, who has neither money nor in|tere&s;t, di&s;covers the impo&s;&s;ibility of his e&s;|cape, as well from the ob&s;tinacy of the goaler, as from the walls and bars with which he is &s;urrounded; and in all attempts for his freedom chu&s;es rather to work up|on the &s;tone and iron of the one, than upon the inflexible nature of the other. The &s;ame pri&s;oner, when conducted to the &s;caffold, fore&s;ees his death as certainly from the con&s;tancy and fidelity of his guards as from the operation of the ax or wheel. His mind runs along a certain train of
<PB N="233" REF="238">
ideas: The refu&s;al of the &s;oldiers to con|&s;ent to his e&s;cape, the action of the exe|cutioner; the &s;eparation of the head and body; bleeding, convul&s;ive motions, and death. Here is a connected chain of natural cau&s;es and voluntary actions; but the mind feels no difference betwixt them in pa&s;&s;ing from one link to another; nor is le&s;s certain of the future event than if it were connected with the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ions of the memo|ry and &s;en&s;es by a train of cau&s;es cemented together by what we are pleas'd to call a <HI>phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> The &s;ame experienc'd union has the &s;ame effect on the mind, whether the united objects be motives, vo|litions and actions; or figure and motion. We may change the names of things; but their nature and their operation on the un|der&s;tanding never change.</P>
<P>I DARE be po&s;itive no one will ever en|deavour to refute the&s;e rea&s;ouings otherwi&s;e than by altering my definitions, and a&s;&s;ign|ing a different meaning to the terms of <HI>cau&s;e, and effect, and nece&s;&s;ity, and liberty, and chance.</HI> According to my definitions, nece&s;&s;ity makes an e&s;&s;ential part of cau&s;ation; and con&s;e|quently liberty, by removing nece&s;&s;ity, re|moves al&s;o cau&s;es, and is the very &s;ame
<PB N="234" REF="239">
thing with chance. As chance is commonly thought to imply a contradiction, and is at lea&s;t directly contrary to experience, there are always the &s;ame arguments again&s;t li|berty or free-will. If any one alters the definitions, I cannot pretend to argue with him, 'till I know the meaning he a&s;&s;igns to the&s;e terms.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. <HI>The &s;ame &s;ubject continu'd.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I BELIEVE we may a&s;&s;ign the three following rea&s;ons for the prevalence of the doctrine of liberty, however ab&s;urd it may be in one &s;en&s;e, and unintelligible in any other. Fir&s;t, After we have perform'd any action; tho' we confe&s;s we were in|fluenc'd by particular views and motives; 'tis difficult for us to per&s;wade our&s;elves we were govern'd by nece&s;&s;ity, and that 'twas utterly impo&s;&s;ible for us to have acted other|wi&s;e; the idea of nece&s;&s;ity &s;eeming to im|ply &s;omething of force, and violence, and con&s;traint, of which we are not &s;en&s;ible. Few are capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing betwixt the liberty of <HI>&s;pontaniety,</HI> as it is call'd in
<PB N="235" REF="240">
the &s;chools, and the liberty of <HI>indifference;</HI> betwixt that which is oppos'd to violence, and that which means a negation of nece&s;|&s;ity and cau&s;es. The fir&s;t is even the mo&s;t common &s;en&s;e of the word; and as 'tis only that &s;pecies of liberty, which it con|cerns us to pre&s;erve, our thoughts have been principally turn'd towards it, and have almo&s;t univer&s;ally confounded it with the other.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, There is a <HI>fal&s;e &s;en&s;ation or experience</HI> even of the liberty of indif|ference; which is regarded as an argument for its real exi&s;tence. The nece&s;&s;ity of any action, whether of matter or of the mind, is not properly a quality in the agent, but in any thinking or intelligent being, who may con&s;ider the action, and con&s;i&s;ts in the determination of his thought to infer its exi&s;tence from &s;ome preceding objects: As liberty or chance, on the other hand, is nothing but the want of that determination, and a certain loo&s;ene&s;s, which we feel in pa&s;&s;ing or not pa&s;&s;ing from the idea of one to that of the other. Now we may ob&s;erve, that tho' in reflecting on human actions we &s;eldom feel &s;uch a loo&s;ene&s;s or indifference, yet it very commonly happens, that in per|forming the actions them&s;elves we are &s;en|&s;ible
<PB N="236" REF="241">
of &s;omething like it: And as all re|lated or re&s;embling objects are readily taken for each other, this has been employ'd as a demon&s;trative or even an intuitive proof of human liberty. We feel that our actions are &s;ubject to our will on mo&s;t occa&s;ions, and imagine we feel that the will it&s;elf is &s;ubject to nothing; becau&s;e when by a de|nial of it we are provok'd to try, we feel that it moves ea&s;ily every way, and pro|duces an image of it&s;elf even on that &s;ide, on which it did not &s;ettle. This image or faint motion, we per&s;wade our&s;elves, cou'd have been compleated into the thing it&s;elf; becau&s;e, &s;hou'd that be deny'd, we find, upon a &s;econd trial, that it can. But the&s;e efforts are all in vain; and whatever capri|cious and irregular actions we may perform; as the de&s;ire of &s;howing our liberty is the &s;ole motive of our actions; we can never free our&s;elves from the bonds of nece&s;&s;ity. We may imagine we feel a liberty within our&s;elves; but a &s;pectator can commonly infer our actions from our motives and cha|racter; and even where he cannot, he con|cludes in general, that he might, were he perfectly acquainted with every circum&s;tance of our &s;ituation and temper, and the mo&s;t
<PB N="237" REF="242">
&s;ecret &s;prings of our complexion and di&s;po|&s;ition. Now this is the very e&s;&s;ence of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, according to the foregoing doc|trine.</P>
<P>A THIRD rea&s;on why the doctrine of liberty has generally been better receiv'd in the world, than its antagoni&s;t, proceeds from <HI>religion,</HI> which has been very unnece&s;&s;arily intere&s;ted in this que&s;tion. There is no method of rea&s;oning more common, and yet none more blameable, than in philo&s;o|phical debates to endeavour to refute any hypothe&s;is by a pretext of its dangerous con&s;equences to religion and morality. When any opinion leads us into ab&s;urdities, 'tis certainly fal&s;e; but 'tis not certain an opi|nion is fal&s;e, becau&s;e 'tis of dangerous con|&s;equence. Such topics, therefore, ought entirely to be foreborn, as &s;erving nothing to the di&s;covery of truth, but only to make the per&s;on of an antagoni&s;t odious. This I ob&s;erve in general, without pretending to draw any advantage from it. I &s;ubmit my|&s;elf frankly to an examination of this kind, and dare venture to affirm, that the doc|trine of nece&s;&s;ity, according to my expli|cation of it, is not only innocent, but even advantageous to religion and morality.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="243">
I DEFINE nece&s;&s;ity two ways, conform|able to the two definitions of <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> of which it makes an e&s;&s;ential part. I place it either in the con&s;tant union and conjunction of like objects, or in the inference of the mind from the one to the other. Now nece&s;&s;ity, in both the&s;e &s;en&s;es, has univer&s;ally, tho' tacitely, in the &s;chools, in the pulpit, and in common life, been allow'd to belong to the will of man, and no one has ever pre|tended to deny, that we can draw inferences concerning human actions, and that tho&s;e inferences are founded on the experienc'd union of like actions with like motives and circum&s;tances. The only particular in which any one can differ from me, is either, that perhaps he will refu&s;e to call this nece&s;&s;ity. But as long as the meaning is under&s;tood, I hope the word can do no harm. Or that he will maintain there is &s;omething el&s;e in the operations of matter. Now whether it be &s;o or not is of no con&s;equence to re|ligion, whatever it may be to natural phi|lo&s;ophy. I may be mi&s;taken in a&s;&s;erting, that we have no idea of any other con|nexion in the actions of body, and &s;hall be glad to be farther in&s;tructed on that head: But &s;ure I am, I a&s;cribe nothing to the ac|tions

of the mind, but what mu&s;t readily be allow'd of. Let no one, therefore, put an invidous con&s;truction on my words, by &s;aying &s;imply, that I a&s;&s;ert the nece&s;&s;ity of human actions, and place them on the &s;ame footing with the operations of &s;en&s;ele&s;s mat|ter. I do not a&s;cribe to the will that un|intelligible nece&s;&s;ity, which is &s;uppos'd to lie in matter. But I a&s;cribe to matter, that intelligible quality, call it nece&s;&s;ity or not, which the mo&s;t rigorous orthodoxy does or mu&s;t allow to belong to the will. I change, therefore, nothing in the receiv'd &s;y&s;tems, with regard to the will, but only with re|gard to material objects.</P>
<P>NAY I &s;hall go farther, and a&s;&s;ert, that this kind of nece&s;&s;ity is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to reli|gion and morality, that without it there mu&s;t en&s;ue an ab&s;olute &s;ubver&s;ion of both, and that every other &s;uppo&s;ition is entirely de&s;tructive to all laws both <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>hu|man.</HI> 'Tis indeed certain, that as all human laws are founded on rewards and puni&s;h|ments, 'tis &s;uppos'd as a fundamental prin|ciple, that the&s;e motives have an influence on the mind, and both produce the good and prevent the evil actions. We may give to this influence what name we plea&s;e; but
<PB N="240" REF="245">
as 'tis u&s;ually conjoin'd with the action, common &s;en&s;e requires it &s;hou'd be e&s;teem'd a cau&s;e, and be look'd upon as an in&s;tance of that nece&s;&s;ity, which I wou'd e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>THIS rea&s;oning is equally &s;olid, when ap|ply'd to <HI>divine</HI> laws, &s;o far as the deity is con&s;ider'd as a legi&s;lator, and is &s;uppos'd to inflict puni&s;hment and be&s;tow rewards with a de&s;ign to produce obedience. But I al&s;o maintain, that even where he acts not in his magi&s;terial capacity, but is regarded as the avenger of crimes merely on account of their odiou&s;ne&s;s and deformity, not on|ly 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, without the nece&s;&s;ary con|nexion of cau&s;e and effect in human actions, that puni&s;hments cou'd be inflicted compa|tible with ju&s;tice and moral equity; but al&s;o that it cou'd ever enter into the thoughts of any rea&s;onable being to inflict them. The con&s;tant and univer&s;al object of hatred or anger is a per&s;on or creature endow'd with thought and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; and when any criminal or injurious actions excite that pa&s;|&s;ion, 'tis only by their relation to the per|&s;on or connexion with him. But accord|ing to the doctrine of liberty or chance, this connexion is reduc'd to nothing, nor are men more accountable for tho&s;e actions,
<PB N="241" REF="246">
which are de&s;ign'd and premeditated, than for &s;uch as are the mo&s;t ca&s;ual and acci|dental. Actions are by their very nature temporary and peri&s;hing; and where they proceed not from &s;ome cau&s;e in the cha|racters and di&s;po&s;ition of the per&s;on, who perform'd them, they infix not them&s;elves upon him, and can neither redound to his honour, if good, nor infamy, if evil. The action it&s;elf may be blameable; it may be contrary to all the rules of morality and religion: But the per&s;on is not re&s;pon&s;ible for it; and as it proceeded from nothing in him, that is durable or con&s;tant, and leaves nothing of that nature behind it, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible he can, upon its account, be|come the object of puni&s;hment or venge|ance. According to the hypothe&s;is of li|berty, therefore, a man is as pure and un|tainted, after having committed the mo&s;t horrid crimes, as at the fir&s;t moment of his birth, nor is his character any way con|cern'd in his actions; &s;ince they are not deriv'd from it, and the wickedne&s;s of the one can never be us'd as a proof of the de|pravity of the other. 'Tis only upon the principles of nece&s;&s;ity, that a per&s;on acquires any merit or demerit from his actions, how|ever
<PB N="242" REF="247">
the common opinion may incline to the contrary.</P>
<P>BUT &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent are men with them|&s;elves, that tho' they often a&s;&s;ert, that ne|ce&s;&s;ity utterly de&s;troys all merit and demerit either towards mankind or &s;uperior powers, yet they continue &s;till to rea&s;on upon the&s;e very principles of nece&s;&s;ity in all their judg|ments concerning this matter. Men are not blam'd for &s;uch evil actions as they perform ignorantly and ca&s;ually, whatever may be their con&s;equences. Why? but becau&s;e the cau&s;es of the&s;e actions are only momentary, and terminate in them alone. Men are le&s;s blam'd for &s;uch evil actions, as they perform ha&s;tily and unpremeditately, than for &s;uch as proceed from thought and de|liberation. For what rea&s;on? but becau&s;e a ha&s;ty temper, tho' a con&s;tant cau&s;e in the mind, operates only by intervals, and in|fects not the whole character. Again, re|pentance wipes off every crime, e&s;pecially if attended with an evident reformation of life and manners. How is this to be accounted for? But by a&s;&s;erting that ac|tions render a per&s;on criminal, merely as they are proofs of criminal pa&s;&s;ions or prin|ciples in the mind; and when by any al|teration
<PB N="243" REF="248">
of the&s;e principles they cea&s;e to be ju&s;t proofs, they likewi&s;e cea&s;e to be cri|minal. But according to the doctrine of <HI>liberty</HI> or <HI>chance</HI> they never were ju&s;t proofs, and con&s;equently never were criminal.</P>
<P>HERE then I turn to my adver&s;ary, and de&s;ire him to free his own &s;y&s;tem from the&s;e odious con&s;equences before he charge them upon others. Or if he rather chu&s;es, that this que&s;tion &s;hou'd be decided by fair ar|guments before philo&s;ophers, than by decla|mations before the people, let him return to what I have advanc'd to prove that li|berty and chance are &s;ynonimous; and con|cerning the nature of moral evidence and the regularity of human actions. Upon a review of the&s;e rea&s;onings, I cannot doubt of an entire victory; and therefore having prov'd, that all actions of the will have par|ticular cau&s;es, I proceed to explain what the&s;e cau&s;es are, and how they operate.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. <HI>Of the influencing motives of the will.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more u&s;ual in philo|&s;ophy, and even in common life, than to talk of the combat of pa&s;&s;ion and rea&s;on, to give the preference to rea&s;on, and a&s;&s;ert that men are only &s;o far vir|tuous as they conform them&s;elves to its dic|tates. Every rational creature, 'tis &s;aid, is oblig'd to regulate his actions by rea&s;on; and if any other motive or principle challenge the direction of his conduct, he ought to oppo&s;e it, 'till it be entirely &s;ubdu'd, or at lea&s;t brought to a conformity with that &s;u|perior principle. On this method of think|ing the greate&s;t part of moral philo&s;ophy, antient and modern, &s;eems to be founded; nor is their an ampler field, as well for metaphy&s;ical arguments, as popular decla|mations, than this &s;uppos'd pre-eminence of rea&s;on above pa&s;&s;ion. The eternity, inva|riablene&s;s, and divine origin of the former have been di&s;play'd to the be&s;t advantage: The blindne&s;s, uncon&s;tancy, and deceitful|ne&s;s
<PB N="245" REF="250">
of the latter have been as &s;trongly in|&s;i&s;ted on. In order to &s;hew the fallacy of all this philo&s;ophy, I &s;hall endeavour to prove <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that rea&s;on alone can never be a motive to any action of the will; and <HI>&s;e|condly,</HI> that it can never oppo&s;e pa&s;&s;ion in the direction of the will.</P>
<P>THE under&s;tanding exerts it&s;elf after two different ways, as it judges from de|mon&s;tration or probability; as it regards the ab&s;tract relations of our ideas, or tho&s;e re|lations of objects, of which experience on|ly gives us information. I believe it &s;carce will be a&s;&s;erted, that the fir&s;t &s;pecies of rea|&s;oning alone is ever the cau&s;e of any action. As it's proper province is the world of ideas, and as the will always places us in that of realities, demon&s;tration and volition &s;eem, upon that account, to be totally remov'd, from each other. Mathematics, indeed, are u&s;eful in all mechanical operations, and arithmetic in almo&s;t every art and profe&s;|&s;ion: But 'tis not of them&s;elves they have any influence. Mechanics are the art of regulating the motions of bodies <HI>to &s;ome de|&s;ign'd end or purpo&s;e;</HI> and the rea&s;on why we employ arithmetic in fixing the proportions of numbers, is only that we may di&s;cover
<PB N="246" REF="251">
the proportions of their influence and ope|ration. A merchant is de&s;irous of know|ing the &s;um total of his accounts with any per&s;on: Why? but that he may learn what &s;um will have the &s;ame <HI>effects</HI> in paying his debt, and going to market, as all the parti|cular articles taken together. Ab&s;tract or demon&s;trative rea&s;oning, therefore, never influences any of our actions, but only as it directs our judgment concerning cau&s;es and effects; which leads us to the &s;econd operation of the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>'TIS obvious, that when we have the pro&s;pect of pain or plea&s;ure from any ob|ject, we feel a con&s;equent emotion of aver|&s;ion or propen&s;ity, and are carry'd to avoid or embrace what will give us this unea&s;ine&s;s or &s;atisfaction. 'Tis al&s;o obvious, that this emotion re&s;ts not here, but making us ca&s;t our view on every &s;ide, comprehends what|ever objects are connected with its original one by the relation of cau&s;e and effect. Here then rea&s;oning takes place to di&s;cover this relation; and according as our rea&s;oning varies, our actions receive a &s;ub&s;equent va|riation. But 'tis evident in this ca&s;e, that the impul&s;e ari&s;es not from rea&s;on, but is only directed by it. 'Tis from the pro&s;pect
<PB N="247" REF="252">
of pain or plea&s;ure that the aver&s;ion or pro|pen&s;ity ari&s;es towards any object: And the&s;e emotions extend them&s;elves to the cau&s;es and effects of that object, as they are pointed out to us by rea&s;on and experience. It can never in the lea&s;t concern us to know, that &s;uch objects are cau&s;es, and &s;uch others ef|fects, if both the cau&s;es and effects be in|different to us. Where the objects them|&s;elves do not affect us, their connexion can never give them any influence; and 'tis plain, that as rea&s;on is nothing but the di&s;|covery of this connexion, it cannot be by its means that the objects are able to affect us.</P>
<P>SINCE rea&s;on alone can never produce any action, or give ri&s;e to volition, I infer, that the &s;ame faculty is as incapable of preventing volition, or of di&s;puting the pre|ference with any pa&s;&s;ion or emotion. This con&s;equence is nece&s;&s;ary. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible rea&s;on cou'd have the latter effect of pre|venting volition, but by giving an impul&s;e in a contrary direction to our pa&s;&s;ion; and that impul&s;e, had it operated alone, wou'd have been able to produce volition. Nothing can oppo&s;e or retard the impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, but a contrary impul&s;e; and if this con|trary impul&s;e ever ari&s;es from rea&s;on, that
<PB N="248" REF="253">
latter faculty mu&s;t have an original influ|ence on the will, and mu&s;t be able to cau&s;e, as well as hinder any act of volition. But if rea&s;on has no original influence, 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible it can with&s;tand any principle, which has &s;uch an efficacy, or ever keep the mind in &s;u&s;pence a moment. Thus it appears, that the principle, which oppo&s;es our pa&s;&s;ion, cannot be the &s;ame with rea&s;on, and is only call'd &s;o in an improper &s;en&s;e. We &s;peak not &s;trictly and philo&s;ophically when we talk of the combat of pa&s;&s;ion and of rea&s;on. Rea|&s;on is, and ought only to be the &s;lave of the pa&s;&s;ions, and can never pretend to any other office than to &s;erve and obey them. As this opinion may appear &s;omewhat extraordinary, it may not be improper to confirm it by &s;ome other con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>A PASSION is an original exi&s;tence, or, if you will, modification of exi&s;tence, and contains not any repre&s;entative quality, which renders it a copy of any other exi&s;tence or modification. When I am angry, I am actually po&s;&s;e&s;t with the pa&s;&s;ion, and in that emotion have no more a reference to any other object, than when I am thir&s;|ty, or &s;ick, or more than five foot high. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, that this pa&s;&s;ion can be oppos'd by, or be contradictory to
<PB N="249" REF="254">
truth and rea&s;on; &s;ince this contradiction con&s;i&s;ts in the di&s;agreement of ideas, con|&s;ider'd as copies, with tho&s;e objects, which they repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>WHAT may at fir&s;t occur on this head, is, that as nothing can be contrary to truth or rea&s;on, except what has a reference to it, and as the judgments of our under&s;tanding only have this reference, it mu&s;t follow, that pa&s;&s;ions can be contrary to rea&s;on only &s;o far as they are <HI>accompany'd</HI> with &s;ome judgment or opinion. According to this principle, which is &s;o obvious and natural, 'tis only in two &s;en&s;es, that any affection can be call'd unrea&s;onable. Fir&s;t, When a pa&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as hope or fear, grief or joy, de&s;pair or &s;ecurity, is founded on the &s;up|po&s;ition of the exi&s;tence of objects, which really do not exi&s;t. Secondly, When in exerting any pa&s;&s;ion in action, we chu&s;e means in&s;ufficient for the de&s;ign'd end, and deceive our&s;elves in our judgment of cau&s;es and effects. Where a pa&s;&s;ion is nei|ther founded on fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, nor chu&s;es means in&s;ufficient for the end, the under|&s;tanding can neither ju&s;tify nor condemn it. 'Tis not contrary to rea&s;on to prefer the de|&s;truction of the whole world to the &s;cratch|ing
<PB N="250" REF="255">
of my finger. 'Tis not contrary to rea|&s;on for me to chu&s;e my total ruin, to pre|vent the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s of an <HI>Indian</HI> or per&s;on wholly unknown to me. 'Tis as little contrary to rea&s;on to prefer even my own acknowledg'd le&s;&s;er good to my greater, and have a more ardent affection for the former than the latter. A trivial good may, from certain circum&s;tances, produce a de&s;ire &s;uperior to what ari&s;es from the greate&s;t and mo&s;t valuable enjoyment; nor is there any thing more extraordinary in this, than in mechanics to &s;ee one pound weight rai&s;e up a hundred by the advantage of its &s;ituation. In &s;hort, a pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be accompany'd with &s;ome fal&s;e judgment, in order to its being unrea&s;onable; and even then 'tis not the pa&s;&s;ion, properly &s;peaking, which is unrea|&s;onable, but the judgment.</P>
<P>THE con&s;equences are evident. Since a pa&s;&s;ion can never, in any &s;en&s;e, be call'd unrea&s;onable, but when founded on a fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;ition, or when it chu&s;es means in|&s;ufficient for the de&s;ign'd end, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, that rea&s;on and pa&s;&s;ion can ever oppo&s;e each other, or di&s;pute for the government of the will and actions. The moment we perceive the fal&s;hood of any &s;uppo&s;ition, or the in|&s;ufficiency
<PB N="251" REF="256">
of any means our pa&s;&s;ions yield to our rea&s;on without any oppo&s;ition. I may de&s;ire any fruit as of an excellent reli&s;h; but whenever you convince me of my mi&s;|take, my longing cea&s;es. I may will the performance of certain actions as means of obtaining any de&s;ir'd good; but as my will|ing of the&s;e actions is only &s;econdary, and founded on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that they are cau&s;es of the propos'd effect; as &s;oon as I di&s;cover the fal&s;hood of that &s;uppo&s;ition, they mu&s;t become indifferent to me.</P>
<P>'TIS natural for one, that does not ex|amine objects with a &s;trict philo&s;ophic eye, to imagine, that tho&s;e actions of the mind are entirely the &s;ame, which produce not a different &s;en&s;ation, and are not immediately di&s;tingui&s;hable to the feeling and percep|tion. Rea&s;on, for in&s;tance, exerts it&s;elf with|out producing any &s;en&s;ible emotion; and except in the more &s;ublime di&s;qui&s;itions of philo&s;ophy, or in the frivolous &s;ubtilties of the &s;chools, &s;carce ever conveys any plea|&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s. Hence it proceeds, that every action of the mind, which operates with the &s;ame calmne&s;s and tranquillity, is confounded with rea&s;on by all tho&s;e, who judge of things from the fir&s;t view and ap|pearance.
<PB N="252" REF="257">
Now 'tis certain, there are cer|tain calm de&s;ires and tendencies, which, tho' they be real pa&s;&s;ions, produce little emotion in the mind, and are more known by their effects than by the immediate feel|ing or &s;en&s;ation. The&s;e de&s;ires are of two kinds; either certain in&s;tincts originally im|planted in our natures, &s;uch as benevolence and re&s;entment, the love of life, and kind|ne&s;s to children; or the general appetite to good, and aver&s;ion to evil, con&s;ider'd mere|ly as &s;uch. When any of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are calm, and cau&s;e no di&s;order in the &s;oul, they are very readily taken for the deter|minations of rea&s;on, and are &s;uppos'd to proceed from the &s;ame faculty, with that, which judges of truth and fal&s;hood. Their nature and principles have been &s;uppos'd the &s;ame, becau&s;e their &s;en&s;ations are not evidently different.</P>
<P>BESIDE the&s;e calm pa&s;&s;ions, which of|ten determine the will, there are certain violent emotions of the &s;ame kind, which have likewi&s;e a great influence on that fa|culty. When I receive any injury from an|other, I often feel a violent pa&s;&s;ion of re|&s;entment, which makes me de&s;ire his evil and puni&s;hment, independent of all con&s;i|derations
<PB N="253" REF="258">
of plea&s;ure and advantage to my|&s;elf, When I am immediately threaten'd with any grievous ill, my fears, apprehen|&s;ions, and aver&s;ions ri&s;e to a great height, and produce a &s;en&s;ible emotion.</P>
<P>THE common error of metaphy&s;icians has lain in a&s;cribing the direction of the will entirely to one of the&s;e principles, and &s;uppo&s;ing the other to have no influence. Men often act knowingly again&s;t their in|tere&s;t: For which rea&s;on the view of the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible good does not always influ|ence them. Men often counter-act a violent pa&s;&s;ion in pro&s;ecution of their intere&s;ts and de&s;igns: 'Tis not therefore the pre&s;ent un|ea&s;ine&s;s alone, which determines them. In general we may ob&s;erve, that both the&s;e principles operate on the will; and where they are contrary, that either of them pre|vails, according to the <HI>general</HI> character or <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> di&s;po&s;ition of the per&s;on. What we call &s;trength of mind, implies the prevalence of the calm pa&s;&s;ions above the violent; tho' we may ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, there is no man &s;o con&s;tantly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of this virtue, as never on any occa&s;ion to yield to the &s;ollicitations of pa&s;&s;ion and de&s;ire. From the&s;e varia|tions of temper proceeds the great difficulty
<PB N="254" REF="259">
of deciding concerning the actions and re&s;o|lutions of men, where there is any contra|riety of motives and pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IV. <HI>Of the cau&s;es of the violent pa&s;&s;ions.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE is not in philo&s;ophy a &s;ub|ject of more nice &s;peculation than this of the different <HI>cau&s;es</HI> and <HI>effects</HI> of the calm and violent pa&s;&s;ions. 'Tis evident pa&s;&s;ions influence not the will in proportion to their violence, or the di&s;order they occa|&s;ion in the temper; but on the contrary, that when a pa&s;&s;ion has once become a &s;et|tled principle of action, and is the predo|minant inclination of the &s;oul, it common|ly produces no longer any &s;en&s;ible agitation. As repeated cu&s;tom and its own force have made every thing yield to it, it directs the actions and conduct without that oppo&s;i|tion and emotion, which &s;o naturally at|tend every momentary gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion. We mu&s;t, therefore, di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt a calm and a weak pa&s;&s;ion; betwixt a violent and a &s;trong one. But notwith&s;tanding this,
<PB N="255" REF="260">
'tis certain, that when we wou'd govern a man, and pu&s;h him to any action, 'twill commonly be better policy to work upon the violent than the calm pa&s;&s;ions, and ra|ther take him by his inclination, than what is vulgarly call'd his <HI>rea&s;on.</HI> We ought to place the object in &s;uch particular &s;ituations as are proper to encrea&s;e the violence of the pa&s;&s;ion. For we may ob&s;erve, that all de|pends upon the &s;ituation of the object, and that a variation in this particular will be a|ble to change the calm and the violent pa&s;&s;ions into each other. Both the&s;e kinds of pa&s;&s;ions pur&s;ue good, and avoid evil; and both of them are encreas'd or dimini&s;h'd by the en|crea&s;e or diminution of the good or evil. But herein lies the difference betwixt them: The &s;ame good, when near, will cau&s;e a violent pa&s;&s;ion, which, when remote, pro|duces only a calm one. As this &s;ubject be|longs very properly to the pre&s;ent que&s;tion concerning the will, we &s;hall here examine it to the bottom, and &s;hall con&s;ider &s;ome of tho&s;e circum&s;tances and &s;ituations of objects, which render a pa&s;&s;ion either calm or violent.</P>
<P>'TIS a remarkable property of human nature, that any emotion, which attends a
<PB N="256" REF="261">
pa&s;&s;ion, is ea&s;ily converted into it, tho' in their natures they be originally different from, and even contrary to each other. 'Tis true; in order to make a perfect union a|mong pa&s;&s;ions, there is always requir'd a double relation of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas; nor is one relation &s;ufficient for that pur|po&s;e. But tho' this be confirm'd by un|doubted experience, we mu&s;t under&s;tand it with its proper limitations, and mu&s;t regard the double relation, as requi&s;ite only to make one pa&s;&s;ion produce another. When two pa&s;&s;ions are already produc'd by their &s;eparate cau&s;es, and are both pre&s;ent in the mind, they readily mingle and unite, tho' they have but one relation, and &s;ometimes without any. The predominant pa&s;&s;ion &s;wallows up the inferior, and converts it into it&s;elf. The &s;pirits, when once excited, ea&s;ily receive a change in their direction; and 'tis natural to imagine this change will come from the prevailing affection. The connexion is in many re&s;pects clo&s;er betwixt any two pa&s;&s;ions, than betwixt any pa&s;&s;ion and indifference.</P>
<P>WHEN a per&s;on is once heartily in love, the little faults and caprice of his mi&s;tre&s;s, the jealou&s;ies and quarrels, to which that
<PB N="257" REF="262">
commerce is &s;o &s;ubject; however unplea&s;ant and related to anger and hatred; are yet found to give additional force to the prevail|ing pa&s;&s;ion. 'Tis a common artifice of po|liticians, when they wou'd affect any per|&s;on very much by a matter of fact, of which they intend to inform him, fir&s;t to excite his curio&s;ity; delay as long as po&s;&s;ible the &s;atisfying it; and by that means rai&s;e his anxiety and impatience to the utmo&s;t, before they give him a full in&s;ight into the bu&s;ine&s;s. They know that his curio&s;ity will precipitate him into the pa&s;&s;ion they de&s;ign to rai&s;e, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the object in its influence on the mind. A &s;oldier ad|vancing to the battle, is naturally in|&s;pir'd with courage and confidence, when he thinks on his friends and fellow-&s;oldiers; and is &s;truck with fear and terror, when he reflects on the enemy. Whatever new e|motion, therefore, proceeds from the for|mer naturally encrea&s;es the courage; as the &s;ame emotion, proceeding from the latter, augments the fear; by the relation of ideas, and the conver&s;ion of the inferior emotion into the predominant. Hence it is that in martial di&s;cipline, the uniformity and lu&s;tre of our habit, the regularity of our figures
<PB N="258" REF="263">
and motions, with all the pomp and maje|&s;ty of war, encourage our&s;elves and allies; while the &s;ame objects in the enemy &s;trike terror into us, tho' agreeable and beautiful in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>SINCE pa&s;&s;ions, however independent, are naturally transfus'd into each other, if they are both pre&s;ent at the &s;ame time; it follows, that when good or evil is plac'd in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as to cau&s;e any particular emotion, be&s;ide its direct pa&s;&s;ion of de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, that latter pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t acquire new force and violence.</P>
<P>THIS happens, among other ca&s;es, when|ever any object excites contrary pa&s;&s;ions. For 'tis ob&s;ervable that an oppo&s;ition of pa&s;|&s;ions commonly cau&s;es a new emotion in the &s;pirits, and produces more di&s;order, than the concurrence of any two affections of e|qual force. This new emotion is ea&s;ily converted into the predominant pa&s;&s;ion, and encrea&s;es its violence, beyond the pitch it wou'd have arriv'd at had it met with no oppo&s;ition. Hence we naturally de&s;ire what is forbid, and take a plea&s;ure in perform|ing actions, merely becau&s;e they are unlaw|ful. The notion of duty, when oppo&s;ite to the pa&s;&s;ions, is &s;eldom able to overcome
<PB N="259" REF="264">
them; and when it fails of that effect, is apt rather to encrea&s;e them, by producing an oppo&s;ition in our motives and principles.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame effect follows whether the oppo&s;ition ari&s;es from internal motives or external ob&s;tacles. The pa&s;&s;ion commonly acquires new force and violence in both ca&s;es. The efforts, which the mind makes to &s;urmount the ob&s;tacle, excite the &s;pirits and inliven the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>UNCERTAINTY has the &s;ame influence as oppo&s;ition. The agitation of the thought; the quick turns it makes from one view to another; the variety of pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;uc|ceed each other, according to the different views: All the&s;e produce an agitation in the mind, and transfu&s;e them&s;elves into the pre|dominant pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THERE is not in my opinion any other natural cau&s;e, why &s;ecurity dimini&s;hes the pa&s;&s;ions, than becau&s;e it removes that un|certainty, which encrea&s;es them. The mind, when left to it&s;elf, immediately langui&s;hes; and in order to pre&s;erve its ardour, mu&s;t be every moment &s;upported by a new flow of pa&s;&s;ion. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, de&s;pair, tho' contrary to &s;ecurity, has a like influence.</P>
<PB N="260" REF="265">
<P>'TIS certain nothing more powerfully animates any affection, than to conceal &s;ome part of its objects by throwing it into a kind of &s;hade, which at the &s;ame time that it &s;hews enough to pre-po&s;&s;e&s;s us in favour of the object, leaves &s;till &s;ome work for the imagination. Be&s;ides that ob&s;curity is al|ways attended with a kind of uncertainty; the effort, which the fancy makes to com|pleat the idea, rouzes the &s;pirits, and gives an additional force to the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As de&s;pair and &s;ecurity, tho' contrary to each other, produce the &s;ame effects; &s;o ab&s;ence is ob&s;erv'd to have contrary effects, and in different circum&s;tances either encrea&s;es or dimini&s;hes our affections. The <HI>Duc de la Rochefoucault</HI> has very well ob&s;erv'd, that ab&s;ence de&s;troys weak pa&s;&s;ions, but encrea&s;es &s;trong; as the wind extingui&s;hes a candle, but blows up a fire. Long ab&s;ence naturally weakens our idea, and dimini&s;hes the pa&s;&s;ion: But where the idea is &s;o &s;trong and lively as to &s;upport it&s;elf, the unea&s;i|ne&s;s, ari&s;ing from ab&s;ence, encrea&s;es the pa&s;|&s;ion, and gives it new force and violence.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. <HI>Of the effects of cu&s;tom.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUT nothing has a greater effect both to encrea&s;e and dimini&s;h our pa&s;&s;ions, to convert plea&s;ure into pain, and pain into plea&s;ure, than cu&s;tom and repetition. Cu&s;|tom has two <HI>original</HI> effects upon the mind, in be&s;towing a <HI>facility</HI> in the performance of any action or the conception of any ob|ject; and afterwards a <HI>tendency or inclina|tion</HI> towards it; and from the&s;e we may account for all its other effects, however extraordinary.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;oul applies it&s;elf to the per|formance of any action, or the conception of any object, to which it is not accu&s;|tom'd, there is a certain unpliablene&s;s in the faculties, and a difficulty of the &s;pirit's moving in their new direction. As this diffi|culty excites the &s;pirits, 'tis the &s;ource of wonder, &s;urprize, and of all the emotions, which ari&s;e from novelty; and is in it&s;elf very agreeable, like every thing, which in|livens the mind to a moderate degree. But
<PB N="262" REF="267">
tho' &s;urprize be agreeable in it&s;elf, yet as it puts the &s;pirits in agitation, it not only aug|ments our agreeable affections, but al&s;o our painful, according to the foregoing princi|ple, <HI>that every emotion, which precedes or attends a pa&s;&s;ion, is ea&s;ily converted into it.</HI> Hence every thing, that is new, is mo&s;t affecting, and gives us either more plea&s;ure or pain, than what, &s;trictly &s;peaking, na|turally belongs to it. When it often re|turns upon us, the novelty wears off; the pa&s;&s;ions &s;ub&s;ide; the hurry of the &s;pirits is over; and we &s;urvey the objects with great|er tranquillity.</P>
<P>BY degrees the repetition produces a fa|cility, which is another very powerful prin|ciple of the human mind, and an infallible &s;ource of plea&s;ure, where the facility goes not beyond a certain degree. And here 'tis remarkable that the plea&s;ure, which ari&s;es from a moderate facility, has not the &s;ame tendency with that which ari&s;es from novel|ty, to augment the painful, as well as the agreeable affections. The plea&s;ure of facili|ty does not &s;o much con&s;i&s;t in any ferment of the &s;pirits, as in their orderly motion; which will &s;ometimes be &s;o powerful as even to convert pain into plea&s;ure, and give
<PB N="263" REF="268">
us a reli&s;h in time for what at fir&s;t was mo&s;t har&s;h and di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>BUT again, as facility converts pain into plea&s;ure, &s;o it often converts plea&s;ure into pain, when it is too great, and renders the actions of the mind &s;o faint and languid, that they are no longer able to intere&s;t and &s;up|port it. And indeed, &s;carce any other objects become di&s;agreeable thro' cu&s;tom; but &s;uch as are naturally attended with &s;ome emotion or affection, which is de&s;troy'd by the too frequent repetition. One can con&s;ider the clouds, and heavens, and trees, and &s;tones, however frequently repeated, without ever feeling any aver&s;ion. But when the fair &s;ex, or mu&s;ic, or good cheer, or any thing, that naturally ought to be agreeable, be|comes indifferent, it ea&s;ily produces the op|po&s;ite affection.</P>
<P>BUT cu&s;tom not only gives a facility to per|form any action, but likewi&s;e an inclination and tendency towards it, where it is not entire|ly di&s;agreeable, and can never be the object of inclination. And this is the rea&s;on why cu&s;tom encrea&s;es all <HI>active</HI> habits, but dimini&s;hes <HI>pa&s;&s;ive,</HI> according to the ob&s;ervation of a late eminent philo&s;opher. The facility takes off from the force of the pa&s;&s;ive habits by
<PB N="264" REF="269">
rendering the motion of the &s;pirits faint and languid. But as in the active, the &s;pi|rits are &s;ufficiently &s;upported of them&s;elves, the tendency of the mind gives them new force, and bends them more &s;trongly to the action.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. <HI>Of the influence of the imagination on the pa&s;&s;ions.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TIS remarkable, that the imagination and affections have a clo&s;e union to|gether, and that nothing, which affects the former, can be entirely indifferent to the lat|ter. Wherever our ideas of good or evil acquire a new vivacity, the pa&s;&s;ions become more violent; and keep pace with the ima|gination in all its variations. Whether this proceeds from the principle above-mention'd, <HI>that any attendant emotion is ea&s;ily converted into the predominant,</HI> I &s;hall not determine. 'Tis &s;ufficient for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that we have many in&s;tances to confirm this in|fluence of the imagination upon the pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="270">
ANY plea&s;ure, with which we are ac|quainted, affects us more than any other, which we own to be &s;uperior, but of who&s;e nature we are wholly ignorant. Of the one we can form a particular and determinate idea: The other we conceive under the ge|neral notion of plea&s;ure; and 'tis certain, that the more general and univer&s;al any of our ideas are, the le&s;s influence they have upon the imagination. A general idea, tho' it be nothing but a particular one con&s;ider'd in a certain view, is commonly more ob|&s;cure; and that becau&s;e no particular idea, by which we repre&s;ent a general one, is ever fix'd or determinate, but may ea&s;ily be chang'd for other particular ones, which will &s;erve equally in the repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>THERE is a noted pa&s;&s;age in the hi&s;tory of <HI>Greece,</HI> which may &s;erve for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> told the <HI>Athenians,</HI> that he had form'd a de&s;ign, which wou'd be highly u&s;eful to the public, but which 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for him to communicate to them without ruining the execution, &s;ince its &s;ucce&s;s depended entirely on the &s;ecrecy with which it &s;hou'd be conducted. The <HI>Athenians,</HI> in&s;tead of granting him full power to act as he thought fitting, order'd
<PB N="266" REF="271">
him to communicate his de&s;ign to <HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI> in who&s;e prudence they had an entire con|fidence, and who&s;e opinion they were re|&s;olv'd blindly to &s;ubmit to. The de&s;ign of <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> was &s;ecretly to &s;et fire to the fleet of all the <HI>Grecian</HI> commonwealths, which was a&s;&s;embled in a neighbouring port, and which being once de&s;troy'd, wou'd give the <HI>Athenians</HI> the empire of the &s;ea with|out any rival. <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> return'd to the a&s;|&s;embly, and told them, that nothing cou'd be more advantageous than the de&s;ign of <HI>Themi&s;tocles;</HI> but at the &s;ame time that nothing cou'd be more unju&s;t: Upon which the people unanimou&s;ly rejected the project.</P>
<P>A LATE celebrated <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;. <HI>Rollin.</HI></NOTE> hi&s;torian admires this pa&s;&s;age of antient hi&s;tory, as one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular that is any where to be met with. <HI>Here,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>they are not philo&s;ophers, to whom 'tis ea&s;y in their &s;chools to e&s;tabli&s;h the fine&s;t maxims and mo&s;t &s;ublime rules of mo|rality, who decide that intere&s;t ought never to prevail above ju&s;tice. 'Tis a whole people intere&s;ted in the propo&s;al, which is made to them, who con&s;ider it as of importance to the public good, and who notwith&s;tanding reject it unanimou&s;ly, and without he&s;itation, mere|ly</HI>
<PB N="267" REF="272">
<HI>becau&s;e it is contrary to ju&s;tice.</HI> For my part I &s;ee nothing &s;o extraordinary in this proceeding of the <HI>Athenians.</HI> The &s;ame rea|&s;ons, whieh render it &s;o ea&s;y for philo&s;o|phers to e&s;tabli&s;h the&s;e &s;ublime maxims, tend, in part, to dimini&s;h the merit of &s;uch a conduct in that people. Philo&s;ophers ne|ver ballance betwixt profit and hone&s;ty, be|cau&s;e their deci&s;ions are general, and neither their pa&s;&s;ions nor imaginations are intere&s;ted in the objects. And tho' in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e the advantage was immediate to the <HI>Athe|nians,</HI> yet as it was known only under the general notion of advantage, without be|ing conceiv'd by any particular idea, it mu&s;t have had a le&s;s con&s;iderable influence on their imaginations, and have been a le&s;s violent temptation, than if they had been acquainted with all its circum&s;tances: Other|wi&s;e 'tis difficult to conceive, that a whole people, unju&s;t and violent as men com|monly are, &s;hou'd &s;o unanimou&s;ly have ad|her'd to ju&s;tice, and rejected any con&s;ider|able advantage.</P>
<P>ANY &s;atisfaction, which we lately en|joy'd, and of which the memory is fre&s;h and recent, operates on the will with more violence, than another of which the traces
<PB N="268" REF="273">
are decay'd, and almo&s;t obliterated. From whence does this proceed, but that the me|mory in the fir&s;t ca&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;ts the fancy, and gives an additional force and vigour to its conceptions? The image of the pa&s;t plea|&s;ure being &s;trong and violent, be&s;tows the&s;e qualities on the idea of the future plea&s;ure, which is connected with it by the relation of re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>A PLEASURE, which is &s;uitable to the way of life, in which we are engag'd, ex|cites more our de&s;ires and appetites than another, which is foreign to it. This phae|nomenon may be explain'd from the &s;ame principle.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more capable of infu&s;ing any pa&s;&s;ion into the mind, than eloquence, by which objects are repre&s;ented in their &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t lively colours. We may of our&s;elves acknowledge, that &s;uch an object is valuable, and &s;uch another odi|ous; but 'till an orator excites the imagina|tion, and gives force to the&s;e ideas, they may have but a feeble influence either on the will or the affections.</P>
<P>BUT eloquence is not always nece&s;&s;ary. The bare opinion of another, e&s;pecially when inforc'd with pa&s;&s;ion, will cau&s;e an idea of
<PB N="269" REF="274">
good or evil to have an influence upon us, which wou'd otherwi&s;e have been entirely neglected. This proceeds from the princi|ple of &s;ympathy or communication; and &s;ympathy, as I have already ob&s;erv'd, is no|thing but the conver&s;ion of an idea into an impre&s;&s;ion by the force of imagination.</P>
<P>'TIS remarkable, that lively pa&s;&s;ions commonly attend a lively imagination. In this re&s;pect, as well as others, the force of the pa&s;&s;ion depends as much on the tem|per of the per&s;on, as the nature or &s;ituation of the object.</P>
<P>I HAVE already ob&s;erv'd, that belief is nothing but a lively idea related to a pre|&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion. This vivacity is a requi|&s;ite circum&s;tance to the exciting all our pa&s;|&s;ions, the calm as well as the violent; nor has a mere fiction of the imagination any con&s;iderable influence upon either of them. 'Tis too weak to take any hold of the mind, or be attended with emotion.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. <HI>Of contiguity and di&s;tance in &s;pace and time.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE is an ea&s;y rea&s;on, why e|very thing contiguous to us, either in &s;pace or time, &s;hou'd be conceiv'd with a peculiar force and vivacity, and excel e|very other object, in its influence on the imagination. Our&s;elf is intimately pre&s;ent to us, and whatever is related to &s;elf mu&s;t partake of that quality. But where an ob|ject is &s;o far remov'd as to have lo&s;t the ad|vantage of this relation, why, as it is far|ther remov'd, its idea becomes &s;till fainter and more ob&s;cure, wou'd, perhaps, require a more particular examination.</P>
<P>'TIS obvious, that the imagination can never totally forget the points of &s;pace and time, in which we are exi&s;tent; but receives &s;uch frequent adverti&s;ements of them from the pa&s;&s;ions and &s;en&s;es, that however it may turn its attention to foreign and remote ob|jects, it is nece&s;&s;itated every moment to re|flect
<PB N="271" REF="276">
on the pre&s;ent. 'Tis al&s;o remarkable, that in the conception of tho&s;e objects, which we regard as real and exi&s;tent, we take them in their proper order and &s;itua|tion, and never leap from one object to a|nother, which is di&s;tant from it, without running over, at lea&s;t in a cur&s;ory manner, all tho&s;e objects, which are interpos'd be|twixt them. When we reflect, therefore, on any object di&s;tant from our&s;elves, we are oblig'd not only to reach it at fir&s;t by pa&s;&s;ing thro' all the intermediate &s;pace be|twixt our&s;elves and the object, but al&s;o to renew our progre&s;s every moment; being every moment recall'd to the con&s;ideration of our&s;elves and our pre&s;ent &s;ituation. 'Tis ea&s;ily conceiv'd, that this interruption mu&s;t weaken the idea by breaking the action of the mind, and hindering the conception from be|ing &s;o inten&s;e and continu'd, as when we reflect on a nearer object. The <HI>fewer</HI> &s;teps we make to arrive at the object, and the <HI>&s;mooth|er</HI> the road is, this diminution of vivacity is le&s;s con&s;iderably felt, but &s;till may be ob&s;erv'd more or le&s;s in proportion to the degrees of di&s;tance and difficulty.</P>
<P>HERE then we are to con&s;ider two kinds of objects, the contiguous and remote; of
<PB N="272" REF="277">
which the former, by means of their rela|tion to our&s;elves, approach an impre&s;&s;ion in force and vivacity; the latter by rea&s;on of the interruption in our manner of con|ceiving them, appear in a weaker and more imperfect light. This is their effect on the imagination. If my rea&s;oning be ju&s;t, they mu&s;t have a proportionable ef|fect on the will and pa&s;&s;ions. Contiguous objects mu&s;t have an influence much &s;upe|rior to the di&s;tant and remote. Accordingly we find in common life, that men are prin|cipally concern'd about tho&s;e objects, which are not much remov'd either in &s;pace or time, enjoying the pre&s;ent, and leaving what is afar off to the care of chance and for|tune. Talk to a man of his condition thirty years hence, and he will not regard you. Speak of what is to happen to-mor|row, and he will lend you attention. The breaking of a mirror gives us more concern when at home, than the burning of a hou&s;e, when abroad, and &s;ome hundred leagues di&s;tant.</P>
<P>BUT farther; tho' di&s;tance both in &s;pace and time has a con&s;iderable effect on the imagination, and by that means on the will and pa&s;&s;ions, yet the con&s;equence of a re|moval
<PB N="273" REF="278">
in <HI>&s;pace</HI> are much inferior to tho&s;e of a removal in <HI>time.</HI> Twenty years are certainly but a &s;mall di&s;tance of time in compari&s;on of what hi&s;tory and even the memory of &s;ome may inform them of, and yet I doubt if a thou&s;and leagues, or even the greate&s;t di&s;tance of place this globe can admit of, will &s;o remarkably weaken our ideas, and dimini&s;h our pa&s;&s;ions. A <HI>We&s;t|India</HI> merchant will tell you, that he is not without concern about what pa&s;&s;es in <HI>Ja|maica;</HI> tho' few extend their views &s;o far into futurity, as to dread very remote acci|dents.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;e of this phaenomenon mu&s;t e|vidently lie in the different properties of &s;pace and time. Without having recour&s;e to metaphy&s;ics, any one may ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, that &s;pace or exten&s;ion con&s;i&s;ts of a number of co-exi&s;tent parts di&s;pos'd in a certain order, and capable of being at once pre|&s;ent to the &s;ight or feeling. On the contrary, time or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, tho' it con&s;i&s;ts likewi&s;e of parts, never pre&s;ents to us more than one at once; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for any two of them ever to be co-exi&s;tent. The&s;e qualities of the objects have a &s;uitable effect on the imagination. The parts of exten&s;ion
<PB N="274" REF="279">
being &s;u&s;ceptible of an union to the &s;en&s;es, acquire an union in the fancy; and as the ap|pearance of one part excludes not another, the tran&s;ition or pa&s;&s;age of the thought thro' the contiguous parts is by that means render'd more &s;mooth and ea&s;y. On the other hand, the incompatibility of the parts of time in their real exi&s;tence &s;eparates them in the i|magination, and makes it more <HI>difficult</HI> for that faculty to trace any long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or &s;eries of events. Every part mu&s;t appear &s;ingle and alone, nor can regularly have en|trance into the fancy without bani&s;hing what is &s;uppos'd to have been immediately prece|dent. By this means any di&s;tance in time cau&s;es a greater interruption in the thought than an equal di&s;tance in &s;pace, and con&s;e|quently weakens more con&s;iderably the idea, and con&s;equently the pa&s;&s;ions; which depend in a great mea&s;ure, on the imagination, ac|cording to my &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THERE is another phaenomenon of a like nature with the foregoing, viz. <HI>the &s;u|perior effects of the &s;ame di&s;tance in futurity above that in the pa&s;t.</HI> This difference with re&s;pect to the will is ea&s;ily accounted for. As none of our actions can alter the pa&s;t, 'tis not &s;trange it &s;hou'd never determine
<PB N="275" REF="280">
the will. But with re&s;pect to the pa&s;&s;ions the que&s;tion is yet entire, and well worth the examining.</P>
<P>BESIDES the propen&s;ity to a gradual pro|gre&s;&s;ion thro' the points of &s;pace and time, we have another peculiarity in our method of thinking, which concurs in producing this phaenomenon. We always follow the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time in placing our ideas, and from the con&s;ideration of any object pa&s;s more ea&s;ily to that, which follows immedi|ately after it, than to that which went be|fore it. We may learn this, among other in|&s;tances, from the order, which is always ob&s;erv'd in hi&s;torical narrations. Nothing but an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity can oblige an hi&s;|torian to break the order of time, and in his <HI>narration</HI> give the precedence to an e|vent, which was in <HI>reality</HI> po&s;terior to an|other.</P>
<P>THIS will ea&s;ily be apply'd to the que&s;|tion in hand, if we reflect on what I have before ob&s;erv'd, that the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of the per&s;on is always that of the imagina|tion, and that 'tis from thence we proceed to the conception of any di&s;tant object. When the object is pa&s;t, the progre&s;&s;ion of the thought in pa&s;&s;ing to it from the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="276" REF="281">
is contrary to nature, as proceeding from one point of time to that which is preced|ing, and from that to another preceding, in oppo&s;ition to the natural cour&s;e of the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion. On the other hand, when we turn our thought to a future object, our fancy flows along the &s;tream of time, and arrives at the object by an order, which &s;eems mo&s;t natural, pa&s;|&s;ing always from one point of time to that which is immediately po&s;terior to it. This <HI>ea&s;y</HI> progre&s;&s;ion of ideas favours the ima|gination, and makes it conceive its object in a &s;tronger and fuller light, than when we are continually oppos'd in our pa&s;&s;age, and are oblig'd to overcome the difficulties ari|&s;ing from the natural propen&s;ity of the fan|cy. A &s;mall degree of di&s;tance in the pa&s;t has, therefore, a greater effect, in interupt|ing and weakening the conception, than a much greater in the future. From this effect of it on the imagination is deriv'd its influ|ence on the will and pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THERE is another cau&s;e, which both contributes to the &s;ame effect, and proceeds from the &s;ame quality of the fancy, by which we are determin'd to trace the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of time by a &s;imilar &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas. When from the pre&s;ent in&s;tant we
<PB N="277" REF="282">
con&s;ider two points of time equally di&s;|tant in the future and in the pa&s;t, 'tis evident, that, ab&s;tractedly con&s;ider'd, their relation to the pre&s;ent is almo&s;t equal. For as the future will <HI>&s;ometime</HI> be pre&s;ent, &s;o the pa&s;t was <HI>once</HI> pre&s;ent. If we cou'd, therefore, remove this quality of the imagi|nation, an equal di&s;tance in the pa&s;t and in the future, wou'd have a &s;imilar influ|ence. Nor is this only true, when the fan|cy remains fix'd, and from the pre&s;ent in|&s;tant &s;urveys the future and the pa&s;t; but al&s;o when it changes its &s;ituation, and places us in different periods of time. For as on the one hand, in &s;uppo&s;ing our&s;elves ex|i&s;tent in a point of time interpos'd betwixt the pre&s;ent in&s;tant and the future object, we find the future object approach to us, and the pa&s;t retire, and become more di&s;|tant: So on the other hand, in &s;uppo&s;ing our&s;elves exi&s;tent in a point of time inter|pos'd betwixt the pre&s;ent and the pa&s;t, the pa&s;t approaches to us, and the future be|comes more di&s;tant. But from the pro|perty of the fancy above-mention'd we ra|ther chu&s;e to fix our thought on the point of time interpos'd betwixt the pre&s;ent and
<PB N="278" REF="283">
the future, than on that betwixt the pre&s;ent and the pa&s;t. We advance, rather than re|tard our exi&s;tence; and following what &s;eems the natural &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time, pro|ceeed from pa&s;t to pre&s;ent, and from pre|&s;ent to future By which means we con|ceive the future as flowing every moment nearer us, and the pa&s;t as retiring. An equal di&s;tance, therefore, in the pa&s;t and in the future, has not the &s;ame effect on the imagination; and that becau&s;e we con|&s;ider the one as continually encrea&s;ing, and the other as continually dimini&s;hing. The fancy anticipates the cour&s;e of things, and &s;urveys the object in that condition, to which it tends, as well as in that, which is regarded as the pre&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. <HI>The &s;ame &s;ubject continu'd.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THUS we have accounted for three phaenomena, which &s;eem pretty re|markable. Why di&s;tance weakens the con|ception and pa&s;&s;ion: Why di&s;tance in time has a greater effect than that in &s;pace: And why di&s;tance in pa&s;t time has &s;till a great|er effect than that in future. We mu&s;t now con&s;ider three phaenomena, which &s;eem to be, in a manner, the rever&s;e of the&s;e: Why a very great di&s;tance encrea&s;es our e&s;|teem and admiration for an object: Why &s;uch a di&s;tance in time encrea&s;es it more than that in &s;pace: And a di&s;tance in pa&s;t time more than that in future. The curi|ou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;ubject will, I hope, excu&s;e my dwelling on it for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>To begin with the fir&s;t phaenomenon, why a great di&s;tance encrea&s;es our e&s;teem and admiration for an object; 'tis evident that the mere view and contemplation of any greatne&s;s, whether &s;ucce&s;&s;ive or extend|ed, enlarges the &s;oul, and give it a &s;en&s;i|ble delight and plea&s;ure. A wide plain, the
<PB N="280" REF="285">
ocean, eternity, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;everal ages; all the&s;e are entertaining objects, and excel every thing, however beautiful, which ac|companies not its beauty with a &s;uitable greatne&s;s. Now when any very di&s;tant ob|ject is pre&s;ented to the imagination, we na|turally reflect on the interpos'd di&s;tance, and by that means, conceiving &s;omething great and magnificent, receive the u&s;ual &s;atisfac|tion. But as the fancy pa&s;&s;es ea&s;ily from one idea to another related to it, and tran&s;|ports to the &s;econd all the pa&s;&s;ions excited by the fir&s;t, the admiration, which is di|rected to the di&s;tance, naturally diffu&s;es it|&s;elf over the di&s;tant object. Accordingly we find, that 'tis not nece&s;&s;ary the object &s;hou'd be actually di&s;tant from us, in order to cau&s;e our admiration; but that 'tis &s;uf|ficient, if, by the natural a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, it conveys our view to any con&s;iderable di|&s;tance. A great traveller, tho' in the &s;ame chamber, will pa&s;s for a very extraordinary per&s;on; as a <HI>Greek</HI> medal, even in our ca|binet, is always e&s;teem'd a valuable curio|&s;ity. Here the object, by a natural tran&s;i|tion, conveys our view to the di&s;tance; and the admiration, which ari&s;es from that di|&s;tance, by another natural tran&s;ition, re|turns back to the object.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="286">
BUT tho' every great di&s;tance produces an admiration for the di&s;tant object, a di&s;tance in time has a more con&s;iderable effect than that in &s;pace. Antient bu&s;ts and in&s;criptions are more valu'd than <HI>Japan</HI> tables: And not to mention the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> 'tis cer|tain we regard with more veneration the old <HI>Chaldeans</HI> and <HI>Egyptians,</HI> than the mo|dern <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and be&s;tow more fruitle&s;s pains to clear up the hi&s;tory and chronology of the former, than it wou'd co&s;t us to make a voyage, and be certain|ly inform'd of the character, learning and government of the latter. I &s;hall be oblig'd to make a digre&s;&s;ion in order to explain this phaenomenon.</P>
<P>'TIS a quality very ob&s;ervable in hu|man nature, that any oppo&s;ition, which does not entirely di&s;courage and intimidate us, has rather a contrary effect, and in&s;pires us with a more than ordinary grandeur and magnanimity. In collecting our force to overcome the oppo&s;ition, we invigorate the &s;oul, and give it an elevation with which otherwi&s;e it wou'd never have been acquaint|ed. Compliance, by rendering our &s;trength u&s;ele&s;s, makes us in&s;en&s;ible of it; but op|po&s;ition awakens and employs it.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="287">
THIS is al&s;o true in the inver&s;e. Op|po&s;ition not only enlarges the &s;oul; but the &s;oul, when full of courage and magnanimi|ty, in a manner &s;eeks oppo&s;ition.</P>
<Q><L>Spumantemque dari pecora inter inertia votis</L>
<L>Optat aprum, aut fulvum de&s;cendere monte leonem.</L></Q>
<P>WHATEVER &s;upports and fills the pa&s;|&s;ions is agreeable to us; as on the contrary, what weakens and infeebles them is unea&s;y. As oppo&s;ition has the fir&s;t effect, and facili|ty the &s;econd, no wonder the mind, in certain di&s;po&s;itions, de&s;ires the former, and is aver&s;e to the latter.</P>
<P>THESE principles have an effect on the imagination as well as on the pa&s;&s;ions. To be convinc'd of this we need only con&s;ider the influence of <HI>heights</HI> and <HI>depths</HI> on that faculty. Any great elevation of place com|municates a kind of pride or &s;ublimity of imagination, and gives a fancy'd &s;uperiori|ty over tho&s;e that lie below; and, <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> a &s;ublime and &s;trong imagination con|veys the idea of a&s;cent and elevation. Hence it proceeds, that we a&s;&s;ociate, in a manner,
<PB N="283" REF="288">
the idea of whatever is good with that of height, and evil with lowne&s;s. Heaven is &s;uppos'd to be above, and hell below. A noble genius is call'd an elevate and &s;ub|lime one. <HI>Atque udam &s;pernit humum fugi|ente penna.</HI> On the contrary, a vulgar and trivial conception is &s;til'd indifferently low or mean. Pro&s;perity is denominated a&s;|cent, and adver&s;ity de&s;cent. Kings and princes are &s;uppos'd to be plac'd at the top of human affairs; as pea&s;ants and day-la|bourers are &s;aid to be in the lowe&s;t &s;tations. The&s;e methods of thinking, and of expre&s;|&s;ing our&s;elves, are not of &s;o little con&s;e|quence as they may appear at fir&s;t &s;ight.</P>
<P>'TIS evident to common &s;en&s;e, as well as philo&s;ophy, that there is no natural nor e&s;&s;ential difference betwixt high and low, and that this di&s;tinction ari&s;es only from the gravitation of matter, which produces a motion from the one to the other. The very &s;ame direction, which in this part of the globe is call'd <HI>a&s;cent,</HI> is denominated <HI>de&s;cent</HI> in our antipodes; which can proceed from nothing but the contrary tendency of bodies. Now 'tis certain, that the tendency of bodies, continually operating upon our &s;en&s;es, mu&s;t produce, from cu&s;tom, a like
<PB N="284" REF="289">
tendency in the fancy, and that when we con&s;ider any object &s;ituated in an a&s;cent, the idea of its weight gives us a propen&s;ity to tran&s;port it from the place, in which it is &s;ituated, to the place immediately below it, and &s;o on, 'till we come to the ground, which equally &s;tops the body and our ima|gination. For a like rea&s;on we feel a diffi|culty in mounting, and pa&s;s not without a kind of reluctance from the inferior to that which is &s;ituated above it; as if our ideas acquir'd a kind of gravity from their objects. As a proof of this, do we not find, that the facility, which is &s;o much &s;tudy'd in mu&s;ic and poetry, is call'd the fall or ca|dency of the harmony or period; the idea of facility communicating to us that of de|&s;cent, in the &s;ame manner as de&s;cent pro|duces a facility?</P>
<P>SINCE the imagination, therefore, in running from low to high, finds an oppo|&s;ition in its internal qualities and principles, and &s;ince the &s;oul, when elevated with joy and courage, in a manner &s;eeks oppo&s;ition, and throws it&s;elf with alacrity into any &s;cene of thought or action, where its cou|rage meets with matter to nouri&s;h and em|ploy it; it follows, that every thing, which
<PB N="285" REF="290">
invigorates and inlivens the &s;oul, whether by touching the pa&s;&s;ions or imagination, naturally conveys to the fancy this inclina|tion for a&s;cent, and determines it to run again&s;t the natural &s;tream of its thoughts and conceptions. This a&s;piring progre&s;s of the imagination &s;uits the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the mind; and the difficulty, in&s;tead of ex|tingui&s;hing its vigour and alacrity, has the contrary effect, of &s;u&s;taining and encrea&s;ing it. Virtue, genius, power, and riches are for this rea&s;on a&s;&s;ociated with height and &s;ublimity; as poverty, &s;lavery, and folly are conjoin'd with de&s;cent and lowne&s;s. Were the ca&s;e the &s;ame with us as <HI>Milton</HI> repre|&s;ents it to be with the angels, to whom <HI>de|&s;cent is adver&s;e,</HI> and who <HI>cannot &s;ink with|out labour and compul&s;ion,</HI> this order of things wou'd be entirely inverted; as appears hence, that the very nature of a&s;cent and de&s;cent is deriv'd from the difficulty and propen&s;ity, and con&s;equently every one of their effects proceeds from that origin.</P>
<P>ALL this is ea&s;ily apply'd to the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, why a con&s;iderable di&s;tance in time produces a greater veneration for the di&s;|tant objects than a like removal in &s;pace. The imagination moves with more difficul|ty
<PB N="286" REF="291">
in pa&s;&s;ing from one portion of time to another, than in a tran&s;ition thro' the parts of &s;pace; and that becau&s;e &s;pace or exten|&s;ion appears united to our &s;en&s;es, while time or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is always broken and divided. This difficulty, when join'd with a &s;mall di&s;tance, interrupts and weakens the fancy: But has a contrary effect in a great remo|val. The mind, elevated by the va&s;tne&s;s of its object, is &s;till farther elevated by the dif|ficulty of the conception; and being oblig'd every moment to renew its efforts in the tran&s;ition from one part of time to another, feels a more vigorous and &s;ublime di&s;po&s;i|tion, than in a tran&s;ition thro' the parts of &s;pace, where the ideas flow along with ea&s;i|ne&s;s and facility. In this di&s;po&s;ition, the imagination, pa&s;&s;ing, as is u&s;ual, from the con&s;ideration of the di&s;tance to the view of the di&s;tant objects, gives us a proportionable veneration for it; and this is the rea&s;on why all the relicts of antiquity are &s;o pre|cious in our eyes, and appear more valuable than what is brought even from the remote&s;t parts of the world.</P>
<P>THE third phaenomenon I have remark'd will be a full confirmation of this. 'Tis not every removal in time, which has the
<PB N="287" REF="292">
effect of producing veneration and e&s;teem. We are not apt to imagine our po&s;terity will excel us, or equal our ance&s;tors. This phae|nomenon is the more remarkable, becau&s;e any di&s;tance in futurity weakens not our ideas &s;o much as an equal removal in the pa&s;t. Tho' a removal in the pa&s;t, when very great, encrea&s;es our pa&s;&s;ions beyond a like removal in the future, yet a &s;mall re|moval has a greater influence in dimini&s;hing them.</P>
<P>IN our common way of thinking we are plac'd in a kind of middle &s;tation be|twixt the pa&s;t and future; and as our ima|gination finds a kind of difficulty in running along the former, and a facility in follow|ing the cour&s;e of the latter, the difficulty conveys the notion of a&s;cent, and the faci|lity of the contrary. Hence we imagine our ance&s;tors to be, in a manner, mounted above us, and our po&s;terity to lie below us. Our fancy arrives not at the one without effort, but ea&s;ily reaches the other: Which effort weakens the conception, where the di&s;tance is &s;mall; but enlarges and elevates the imagination, when attended with a &s;uit|able object. As on the other hand, the fa|cility a&s;&s;i&s;ts the fancy in a &s;mall removal,
<PB N="288" REF="293">
but takes off from its force when it con|templates any con&s;iderable di&s;tance.</P>
<P>IT may not be improper, before we leave this &s;ubject of the will, to re&s;ume, in a few words, all that has been &s;aid concerning it, in order to &s;et the whole more di&s;tinctly before the eyes of the reader. What we commonly under&s;tand by <HI>pa&s;&s;ion</HI> is a violent and &s;en&s;ible emotion of mind, when any good or evil is pre&s;ented, or any object, which, by the original formation of our faculties, is fitted to excite an appetite. By <HI>rea&s;on</HI> we mean affections of the very &s;ame kind with the former; but &s;uch as operate more calmly, and cau&s;e no di&s;order in the temper: Which tranquillity leads us into a mi&s;take concerning them, and cau&s;es us to regard them as conclu&s;ions only of our in|tellectual faculties. Both the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> and <HI>ef|fects</HI> of the&s;e violent and calm pa&s;&s;ions are pretty variable, and depend, in a great mea|&s;ure, on the peculiar temper and di&s;po&s;ition of every individual. Generally &s;peaking, the violent pa&s;&s;ions have a more powerful in|fluence on the will; tho' 'tis often found, that the calm ones, when corroborated by reflection, and &s;econded by re&s;olution, are able to controul them in their mo&s;t fu|rious
<PB N="289" REF="294">
movements. What makes this whole affair more uncertain, is, that a calm pa&s;|&s;ion may ea&s;ily be chang'd into a violent one, either by a change of temper, or of the circum&s;tances and &s;ituation of the ob|ject, as by the borrowing of force from any attendant pa&s;&s;ion, by cu&s;tom, or by excit|ing the imagination. Upon the whole, this &s;truggle of pa&s;&s;ion and of rea&s;on, as it is call'd, diver&s;ifies human life, and makes men &s;o different not only from each other, but al&s;o from them&s;elves in different times. Phi|lo&s;ophy can only account for a few of the greater and more &s;en&s;ible events of this war; but mu&s;t leave all the &s;maller and more delicate revolutions, as dependent on principles too fine and minute for her com|prehen&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IX. <HI>Of the direct pa&s;&s;ions.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TIS ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that the pa&s;&s;ions, both direct and indirect, are founded on pain and plea&s;ure, and that in order to produce an affection of any kind, 'tis only requi&s;ite to pre&s;ent &s;ome good or evil. Upon the removal of pain and plea&s;ure there im|mediately follows a removal of love and ha|tred, pride and humility, de&s;ire and aver|&s;ion, and of mo&s;t of our reflective or &s;e|condary impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE impre&s;&s;ions, which ari&s;e from good and evil mo&s;t naturally, and with the lea&s;t preparation are the <HI>direct</HI> pa&s;&s;ions of de&s;ire and aver&s;ion, grief and joy, hope and fear, along with volition. The mind by an <HI>ori|ginal</HI> in&s;tinct tends to unite it&s;elf with the good, and to avoid the evil, tho' they be conceiv'd merely in idea, and be con&s;ider'd as to exi&s;t in any future period of time.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;ing that there is an immediate impre&s;&s;ion of pain or plea&s;ure, and <HI>that</HI> ari&s;ing from an object related to our&s;elves or others,
<PB N="291" REF="296">
this does not prevent the propen&s;ity or aver|&s;ion, with the con&s;equent emotions, but by concurring with certain dormant principles of the human mind, excites the new im|pre&s;&s;ions of pride or humility, love or ha|tred. That propen&s;ity, which unites us to the object, or &s;eperates us from it, &s;till con|tinues to operate, but in conjunction with the <HI>indirect</HI> pa&s;&s;ions, which ari&s;e from a double relation of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas.</P>
<P>THESE indirect pa&s;&s;ions, being always agreeable or unea&s;y, give in their turn ad|ditional force to the direct pa&s;&s;ions, and en|crea&s;e our de&s;ire and aver&s;ion to the object. Thus a &s;uit of fine cloaths produces plea|&s;ure from their beauty; and this plea&s;ure produces the direct pa&s;&s;ions, or the impre&s;|&s;ions of volition and de&s;ire. Again, when the&s;e cloaths are con&s;ider'd as belonging to our&s;elf, the double relation conveys to us the &s;entiment of pride, which is an indirect pa&s;&s;ion; and the plea&s;ure, which attends that pa&s;&s;ion, returns back to the direct af|fections, and gives new force to our de&s;ire or volition, joy or hope.</P>
<P>WHEN good is certain or probable, it produces JOY. When evil is in the &s;ame &s;ituation there ari&s;es GRIEF or SORROW.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="297">
WHEN either good or evil is uncertain, it gives ri&s;e to FEAR or HOPE, according to the degrees of uncertainty on the one &s;ide or the other.</P>
<P>DESIRE ari&s;es from good con&s;ider'd &s;im|ply, and AVERSION is deriv'd from evil. The WILL exerts it&s;elf, when either the good or the ab&s;ence of the evil may be at|tain'd by any action of the mind or body.</P>
<P>BESIDE good and evil, or in other words, pain and plea&s;ure, the direct pa&s;&s;ions frequently ari&s;e from a natural impul&s;e or in&s;tinct, which is perfectly unaccountable. Of this kind is the de&s;ire of puni&s;hment to our enemies, and of happine&s;s to our friends; hunger, lu&s;t, and a few other bo|dily appetites. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, properly &s;peaking, produce good and evil, and pro|ceed not from them, like the other affec|tions.</P>
<P>NONE of the direct affections &s;eem to merit our particular attention, except hope and fear, which we &s;hall here endeavour to account for. 'Tis evident that the very &s;ame event, which by its certainty wou'd produce grief or joy, gives always ri&s;e to fear or hope, when only probable and un|certain. In order, therefore, to under&s;tand
<PB N="293" REF="298">
the rea&s;on why this circum&s;tance makes &s;uch a con&s;iderable difference, we mu&s;t re|flect on what I have already advanc'd in the preceding book concerning the nature of probability.</P>
<P>PROBABILITY ari&s;es from an oppo&s;ition of contrary chances or cau&s;es, by which the mind is not allow'd to fix on either &s;ide, but is ince&s;&s;antly to&s;t from one to another, and at one moment is determin'd to con|&s;ider an object as exi&s;tent, and at another moment as the contrary. The imagination or under&s;tanding, call it which you plea&s;e, fluctuates betwixt the oppo&s;ite views; and tho' perhaps it may be oftner turn'd to the one &s;ide than the other, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for it, by rea&s;on of the oppo&s;ition of cau&s;es or chances, to re&s;t on either. The <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> of the que&s;tion alternately prevail; and the mind, &s;urveying the object in its oppo|&s;ite principles, finds &s;uch a contrariety as utterly de&s;troys all certainty and e&s;tabli&s;h'd opinion.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, then, that the object, concern|ing who&s;e reality we are doubtful, is an object either of de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, 'tis evi|dent, that, according as the mind turns it|&s;elf either to the one &s;ide or the other, it
<PB N="294" REF="299">
mu&s;t feel a momentary impre&s;&s;ion of joy or &s;orrow. An object, who&s;e exi&s;tence we de|&s;ire, gives &s;atisfaction, when we reflect on tho&s;e cau&s;es, which produce it; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on excites grief or unea&s;ine&s;s from the oppo&s;ite con&s;ideration: So that as the under&s;tanding, in all probable que&s;tions, is di|vided betwixt the contrary points of view, the affections mu&s;t in the &s;ame manner be divided betwixt oppo&s;ite emotions.</P>
<P>NOW if we con&s;ider the human mind, we &s;hall find, that with regard to the pa&s;|&s;ions, 'tis not of the nature of a wind|in&s;trument of mu&s;ic, which in running o|ver all the notes immediately lo&s;es the &s;ound after the breath cea&s;es; but rather re&s;embles a &s;tring-in&s;trument, where after each &s;troke the vibrations &s;till retain &s;ome &s;ound, which gradually and in&s;en&s;ibly decays. The ima|gination is extreme quick and agile; but the pa&s;&s;ions are &s;low and re&s;tive: For which rea&s;on, when any object is pre&s;ented, that affords a variety of views to the one, and emotions to the other; tho' the fancy may change its views with great celerity; each &s;troke will not produce a clear and di&s;tinct note of pa&s;&s;ion, but the one pa&s;&s;ion will always be mixt and confounded with the
<PB N="295" REF="300">
other. According as the probability inclines to good or evil, the pa&s;&s;ion of joy or &s;orrow predominates in the compo&s;ition: Becau&s;e the nature of probability is to ca&s;t a &s;upe|rior number of views or chances on one &s;ide; or, which is the &s;ame thing, a &s;uperior number of returns of one pa&s;&s;ion; or &s;ince the di&s;pers'd pa&s;&s;ions are collected into one, a &s;uperior degree of that pa&s;&s;ion. That is, in other words, the grief and joy being in|termingled with each other, by means of the contrary views of the imagination, pro|duce by their union the pa&s;&s;ions of hope and fear.</P>
<P>UPON this head there may be &s;tarted a very curious que&s;tion concerning that con|trariety of pa&s;&s;ions, which is our pre&s;ent &s;ubject. 'Tis ob&s;ervable, that where the ob|jects of contrary pa&s;&s;ions are pre&s;ented at once, be&s;ide the encrea&s;e of the predomi|nant pa&s;&s;ion (which has been already ex|plain'd, and commonly ari&s;es at their fir&s;t &s;hock or rencounter) it &s;ometimes happens, that both the pa&s;&s;ions exi&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and by &s;hort intervals; &s;ometimes, that they de&s;troy each other, and neither of them takes place; and &s;ometimes that both of them remain united in the mind. It may,
<PB N="296" REF="301">
therefore, be a&s;k'd, by what theory we can explain the&s;e variations, and to what general principle we can reduce them.</P>
<P>WHEN the contrary pa&s;&s;ions ari&s;e from objects entirely different, they take place al|ternately, the want of relation in the ideas &s;eperating the impre&s;&s;ions from each other, and preventing their oppo&s;ition. Thus when a man is afflicted for the lo&s;s of a law-&s;uit, and joyful for the birth of a &s;on, the mind running from the agreeable to the calamitous object, with whatever celerity it may per|form this motion, can &s;carcely temper the one affection with the other, and remain betwixt them in a &s;tate of indifference.</P>
<P>IT more ea&s;ily attains that calm &s;itu|ation, when the &s;ame event is of a mixt nature, and contains &s;omething adver&s;e and &s;omething pro&s;perous in its different cir|cum&s;tances. For in that ca&s;e, both the pa&s;&s;ions, mingling with each other by means of the relation, become mutually de&s;truc|tive, and leave the mind in perfect tran|quility.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e, in the third place, that the object is not a compound of good or evil, but is con&s;ider'd as probable or impro|bable in any degree; in that ca&s;e I a&s;&s;ert,
<PB N="297" REF="302">
that the contrary pa&s;&s;ions will both of them be pre&s;ent at once in the &s;oul, and in&s;tead of de&s;troying and tempering each other, will &s;ub&s;i&s;t together, and produce a third impre&s;&s;ion or affection by their union. Contrary pa&s;&s;ions are not capable of de&s;troy|ing each other, except when their contrary movements exactly rencounter, and are op|po&s;ite in their direction, as well as in the &s;en&s;ation they produce. This exact ren|counter depends upon the relations of tho&s;e ideas, from which they are deriv'd, and is more or le&s;s perfect, according to the de|grees of the relation. In the ca&s;e of proba|bility the contrary chances are &s;o far relat|ed, that they determine concerning the ex|i&s;tence or non-exi&s;tence of the &s;ame object. But this relation is far from being perfect; &s;ince &s;ome of the chances lie on the &s;ide of exi&s;tence, and others on that of non-exi&s;|tence; which are objects altogether incom|patible. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible by one &s;teady view to &s;urvey the oppo&s;ite chances, and the e|vents dependent on them; but 'tis nece&s;&s;ary, that the imagination &s;hou'd run alternately from the one to the other. Each view of the imagination produces its peculiar pa&s;|&s;ion, which decays away by degrees, and is
<PB N="298" REF="303">
follow'd by a &s;en&s;ible vibration after the &s;troke. The incompatibility of the views keeps the pa&s;&s;ions from &s;hocking in a di|rect line, if that expre&s;&s;ion may be allow'd; and yet their relation is &s;ufficient to mingle their fainter emotions. 'Tis after this man|ner that hope and fear ari&s;e from the diffe|rent mixture of the&s;e oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions of grief and joy, and from their imperfect u|nion and conjunction.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, contrary pa&s;&s;ions &s;uc|ceed each other alternately, when they a|ri&s;e from different objects: They mutually de&s;troy each other, when they proceed from different parts of the &s;ame: And they &s;ub|&s;i&s;t both of them, and mingle together, when they are deriv'd from the contrary and in|compatible chances or po&s;&s;ibilities, on which any one object depends. The influence of the relations of ideas is plainly &s;een in this whole affair. If the objects of the contrary pa&s;&s;ions be totally different, the pa&s;&s;ions are like two oppo&s;ite liquors in different bottles, which have no influence on each other. If the objects be intimately connected, the pa&s;|&s;ions are like an <HI>alcali</HI> and an <HI>acid,</HI> which, being mingled, de&s;troy each other. If the relation be more imperfect, and con&s;i&s;ts in
<PB N="299" REF="304">
the contradictory views of the &s;ame object, the pa&s;&s;ions are like oil and vinegar, which, however mingled, never perfectly unite and incorporate.</P>
<P>AS the hypothe&s;is concerning hope and fear carries its own evidence along with it, we &s;hall be the more conci&s;e in our proofs. A few &s;trong arguments are better than many weak ones.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ions of fear and hope may a|ri&s;e when the chances are equal on both &s;ides, and no &s;uperiority can be di&s;cover'd in the one above the other. Nay, in this &s;ituation the pa&s;&s;ions are rather the &s;trong|e&s;t, as the mind has then the lea&s;t founda|tion to re&s;t upon, and is to&s;s'd with the greate&s;t uncertainty. Throw in a &s;uperior degree of probability to the &s;ide of grief, you immediately &s;ee that pa&s;&s;ion diffu&s;e it|&s;elf over the compo&s;ition, and tincture it into fear. Encrea&s;e the probability, and by that means the grief, the fear prevails &s;till more and more, till at la&s;t it runs in|&s;en&s;ibly, as the joy continually dimini&s;hes, into pure grief. After you have brought it to this &s;ituation, dimini&s;h the grief, after the &s;ame manner that you encreas'd it; by dimini&s;hing the probability on that &s;ide, and
<PB N="300" REF="305">
you'll &s;ee the pa&s;&s;ion clear every moment, 'till it changes in&s;en&s;ibly into hope; which again runs, after the &s;ame manner, by &s;low degrees, into joy, as you encrea&s;e that part of the compo&s;ition by the encrea&s;e of the probability. Are not the&s;e as plain proofs, that the pa&s;&s;ions of fear and hope are mix|tures of grief and joy, as in optics 'tis a proof, that a colour'd ray of the &s;un pa&s;|&s;ing thro' a pri&s;m, is a compo&s;ition of two others, when, as you dimini&s;h or encrea&s;e the quantity of either, you find it prevail proportionably more or le&s;s in the compo&s;i|tion? I am &s;ure neither natural nor moral philo&s;ophy admits of &s;tronger proofs.</P>
<P>PROBABILITY is of two kinds, either when the object is really in it&s;elf uncertain, and to be determin'd by chance; or when, tho' the object be already certain, yet 'tis uncertain to our judgment, which finds a number of proofs on each &s;ide of the que&s;|tion. Both the&s;e kinds of probabilities cau&s;e fear and hope; which can only proceed from that property, in which they agree, <HI>viz.</HI> the uncertainty and fluctuation they be&s;tow on the imagination by that contra|riety of views, which is common to both.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="306">
'TIS a probable good or evil, that com|monly produces hope or fear; becau&s;e pro|bability, being a wavering and uncon&s;tant method of &s;urveying an object, cau&s;es na|turally a like mixture and uncertainty of pa&s;&s;ion. But we may ob&s;erve, that where|ever from other cau&s;es this mixture can be produc'd, the pa&s;&s;ions of fear and hope will ari&s;e, even tho' there be no probability; which mu&s;t be allow'd to be a convincing proof of the pre&s;ent hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>WE find that an evil, barely conceiv'd as <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> does &s;ometimes produce fear; e&s;|pecially if the evil be very great. A man cannot think of exce&s;&s;ive pains and tortures without trembling, if he be in the lea&s;t danger of &s;uffering them. The &s;mallne&s;s of the probability is compen&s;ated by the great|ne&s;s of the evil; and the &s;en&s;ation is equal|ly lively, as if the evil were more probable. One view or glimp&s;e of the former, has the &s;ame effect as &s;everal of the latter.</P>
<P>BUT they are not only po&s;&s;ible evils, that cau&s;e fear, but even &s;ome allow'd to be <HI>impo&s;&s;ible;</HI> as when we tremble on the brink of a precipice, tho' we know our&s;elves to be in perfect &s;ecurity, and have it in our choice whether we will advance a &s;tep far|ther.
<PB N="302" REF="307">
This proceeds from the immediate pre&s;ence of the evil, which influences the imagination in the &s;ame manner as the cer|tainty of it wou'd do; but being encoun|ter'd by the reflection on our &s;ecurity, is immediately retracted, and cau&s;es the &s;ame kind of pa&s;&s;ion, as when from a contrariety of chances contrary pa&s;&s;ions are produc'd.</P>
<P>EVILS, that are <HI>certain,</HI> have &s;ometimes the &s;ame effect in producing fear, as the po&s;|&s;ible or impo&s;&s;ible. Thus a man in a &s;trong pri&s;on well-guarded, without the lea&s;t means of e&s;cape, trembles at the thought of the rack, to which he is &s;entenc'd. This hap|pens only when the certain evil is terrible and confounding; in which ca&s;e the mind continually rejects it with horror, while it continually pre&s;&s;es in upon the thought. The evil is there fix'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd, but the mind cannot endure to fix upon it; from which fluctuation and uncertainty there a|ri&s;es a pa&s;&s;ion of much the &s;ame appearance with fear.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis not only where good or evil is uncertain, as to its <HI>exi&s;tence,</HI> but al&s;o as to its <HI>kind,</HI> that fear or hope ari&s;es. Let one be told by a per&s;on, who&s;e veracity he cannot doubt of, that one of his &s;ons is &s;uddenly
<PB N="303" REF="308">
kill'd, 'tis evident the pa&s;&s;ion this event wou'd occa&s;ion, wou'd not &s;ettle into pure grief, till he got certain information, which of his &s;ons he had lo&s;t. Here there is an evil certain, but the kind of it uncertain: Con&s;equently the fear we feel on this occa|&s;ion is without the lea&s;t mixture of joy, and ari&s;es merely from the fluctuation of the fancy betwixt its objects. And tho' each &s;ide of the que&s;tion produces here the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion, yet that pa&s;&s;ion cannot &s;ettle, but receives from the imagination a tremulous and un&s;teady motion, re&s;embling in its cau&s;e, as well as in its &s;en&s;ation, the mix|ture and contention of grief and joy.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e principles we may account for a phaenomenon in the pa&s;&s;ions, which at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;eems very extraordinary, <HI>viz.</HI> that &s;urprize is apt to change into fear, and every thing that is unexpected affrights us. The mo&s;t obvious conclu&s;ion from this is, that human nature is in general pu&s;ilani|mous; &s;ince upon the &s;udden appearance of any object we immediately conclude it to be an evil, and without waiting till we can examine its nature, whether it be good or bad, are at fir&s;t affected with fear. This I &s;ay is the mo&s;t obvious conclu&s;ion; but up|on
<PB N="304" REF="309">
farther examination we &s;hall find that the phaenomenon is otherwi&s;e to be ac|counted for. The &s;uddenne&s;s and &s;trange|ne&s;s of an appearance naturally excite a commotion in the mind, like every thing for which we are not prepar'd, and to which we are not accu&s;tom'd. This commotion, again, naturally produces a curio&s;ity or in|qui&s;itivene&s;s, which being very violent, from the &s;trong and &s;udden impul&s;e of the ob|ject, becomes unea&s;y, and re&s;embles in its fluctuation and uncertainty, the &s;en&s;ation of fear or the mix'd pa&s;&s;ions of grief and joy. This image of fear naturally converts into the thing it&s;elf, and gives us a real appre|hen&s;ion of evil, as the mind always forms its judgments more from its pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition than from the nature of its objects.</P>
<P>THUS all kinds of uncertainty have a &s;trong connexion with fear, even tho' they do not cau&s;e any oppo&s;ition of pa&s;&s;ions by the oppo&s;ite views and con&s;iderations they pre&s;ent to us. A per&s;on, who has left his friend in any malady, will feel more anxiety upon his account, than if he were pre&s;ent, tho' perhaps he is not only incapa|ble of giving him a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but likewi&s;e of judging of the event of his &s;ickne&s;s. In
<PB N="305" REF="310">
this ca&s;e, tho' the principal object of the pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> the life or death of his friend, be to him equally uncertain when pre&s;ent as when ab&s;ent; yet there are a thou&s;and lit|tle circum&s;tances of his friend's &s;ituation and condition, the knowledge of which fixes the idea, and prevents that fluctuation and uncertainty &s;o near ally'd to fear. Uncer|tainty is, indeed, in one re&s;pect as near al|ly'd to hope as to fear, &s;ince it makes an e&s;&s;ential part in the compo&s;ition of the for|mer pa&s;&s;ion; but the rea&s;on, why it in|clines not to that &s;ide, is, that uncertainty alone is unea&s;y, and has a relation of im|pre&s;&s;ions to the unea&s;y pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>'TIS thus our uncertainty concerning any minute circum&s;tance relating to a per|&s;on encrea&s;es our apprehen&s;ions of his death or misfortune. <HI>Horace</HI> has remark'd this phaenomenon.</P>
<Q><L>Ut a&s;&s;idens implumibus pullus avis</L>
<L>Serpentium allap&s;us timet,</L>
<L>Magis relictis; non, ut ad&s;it, auxili</L>
<L>Latura plus pre&s;entibus.</L></Q>
<P>BUT this principle of the connexion of fear with uncertainty I carry farther, and
<PB N="306" REF="311">
ob&s;erve that any doubt produces that pa&s;|&s;ion, even tho' it pre&s;ents nothing to us on any &s;ide but what is good and de&s;ireable. A virgin, on her bridal-night goes to bed full of fears and apprehen&s;ions, tho' &s;he expects nothing but plea&s;ure of the highe&s;t kind, and what &s;he has long wi&s;h'd for. The newne&s;s and greatne&s;s of the event, the confu&s;ion of wi&s;hes and joys, &s;o embarra&s;s the mind, that it knows not on what pa&s;|&s;ion to fix it&s;elf; from whence ari&s;es a fluttering or un&s;ettledne&s;s of the &s;pirits, which being, in &s;ome degree, unea&s;y, very naturally degenerates into fear.</P>
<P>THUS we &s;till find, that whatever cau&s;es any fluctuation or mixture of pa&s;&s;ions, with any degree of unea&s;ine&s;s, always produces fear, or at lea&s;t a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o like it, that they are &s;carcely to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd.</P>
<P>I HAVE here confin'd my&s;elf to the examination of hope and fear in their mo&s;t &s;imple and natural &s;ituation, without con|&s;idering all the variations they may receive from the mixture of different views and re|flections. <HI>Terror, con&s;ternation, a&s;toni&s;h|ment, anxiety,</HI> and other pa&s;&s;ions of that kind, are nothing but different &s;pecies and
<PB N="307" REF="312">
degrees of fear. 'Tis ea&s;y to imagine how a different &s;ituation of the object, or a diffe|rent turn of thought, may change even the &s;en&s;ation of a pa&s;&s;ion; and this may in ge|neral account for all the particular &s;ub-di|vi&s;ions of the other affections, as well as of fear. Love may &s;hew it&s;elf in the &s;hape of <HI>tenderne&s;s, friend&s;hip, intimacy, e&s;teem, good-will,</HI> and in many other appearances; which at the bottom are the &s;ame affections, and ari&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;es, tho' with a &s;mall variation, which it is not nece&s;&s;ary to give any particular account of. 'Tis for this rea&s;on I have all along confin'd my|&s;elf to the principal pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame care of avoiding prolixity is the rea&s;on why I wave the examination of the will and direct pa&s;&s;ions, as they appear in animals; &s;ince nothing is more evident, than that they are of the &s;ame nature, and excited by the &s;ame cau&s;es as in human crea|tures. I leave this to the reader's own ob&s;er|vation; de&s;iring him at the &s;ame time to con&s;ider the additional force this be&s;tows on the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. X. <HI>Of curio&s;ity, or the love of truth.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUT methinks we have been not a little inattentive to run over &s;o many different parts of the human mind, and examine &s;o many pa&s;&s;ions, without tak|ing once into the con&s;ideration that love of truth, which was the fir&s;t &s;ource of all our enquiries. 'Twill therefore be proper, be|fore we leave this &s;ubject, to be&s;tow a few reflections on that pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;hew its ori|gin in human nature. 'Tis an affection of &s;o peculiar a kind, that 'twoud have been impo&s;&s;ible to have treated of it under any of tho&s;e heads, which we have examin'd, without danger of ob&s;curity and confu|&s;ion.</P>
<P>TRUTH is of two kinds, con&s;i&s;ting either in the di&s;covery of the proportions of ideas, con|&s;ider'd as &s;uch, or in the conformity of our ideas of objects to their real exi&s;tence. 'Tis certain, that the former &s;pecies of truth, is not de&s;ir'd merely as truth, and that 'tis not the
<PB N="309" REF="314">
ju&s;tne&s;s of our conclu&s;ions, which alone gives the plea&s;ure. For the&s;e conclu&s;ions are equally ju&s;t, when we di&s;cover the equa|lity of two bodies by a pair of compa&s;&s;es, as when we learn it by a mathematical de|mon&s;tration; and tho' in the one ca&s;e the proofs be demon&s;trative, and in the other only &s;en&s;ible, yet generally &s;peaking, the mind acquie&s;ces with equal a&s;&s;urance in the one as in the other. And in an arithmetical operation, where both the truth and the a&s;|&s;urance are of the &s;ame nature, as in the mo&s;t profound algebraical problem, the plea&s;ure is very incon&s;iderable, if rather it does not degenerate into pain: Which is an evident proof, that the &s;atisfaction, which we &s;ometimes receive from the di&s;covery of truth, proceeds not from it, merely as &s;uch, but only as endow'd with certain quali|ties.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable cir|cum&s;tance requi&s;ite to render truth agree|able, is the genius and capacity, which is employ'd in its invention and di&s;covery. What is ea&s;y and obvious is never valu'd; and even what is <HI>in it&s;elf</HI> difficult, if we come to the knowledge of it without diffi|culty,
<PB N="310" REF="315">
and without any &s;tretch of thought or judgment, is but little regarded. We love to trace the demon&s;trations of mathe|maticians; but &s;hou'd receive &s;mall enter|tainment from a per&s;on, who &s;hou'd bare|ly inform us of the proportions of lines and angles, tho' we repos'd the utmo&s;t confi|dence both in his judgment and veracity. In this ca&s;e 'tis &s;ufficient to have ears to learn the truth. We never are oblig'd to fix our attention or exert our genius; which of all other exerci&s;es of the mind is the mo&s;t plea|&s;ant and agreeable.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the exerci&s;e of genius be the principal &s;ource of that &s;atisfaction we re|ceive from the &s;ciences, yet I doubt, if it be alone &s;ufficient to give us any con&s;i|derable enjoyment. The truth we di&s;cover mu&s;t al&s;o be of &s;ome importance. 'Tis ea&s;y to multiply algebraical problems to in|finity, nor is there any end in the di&s;co|very of the proportions of conic &s;ections; tho' few mathematicians take any plea&s;ure in the&s;e re&s;earches, but turn their thoughts to what is more u&s;eful and important. Now the que&s;tion is, after what manner this utility and importance operate upon
<PB N="311" REF="316">
us? The difficulty on this head ari&s;es from hence, that many philo&s;ophers have con|&s;urn'd their time, have de&s;troy'd their health, and neglected their fortune, in the &s;earch of &s;uch truths, as they e&s;teem'd im|portant and u&s;eful to the world, tho' it ap|pear'd from their whole conduct and beha|viour, that they were not endow'd with any &s;hare of public &s;pirit, nor had any con|cern for the intere&s;ts of mankind. Were they convinc'd, that their di&s;coveries were of no con&s;equence, they wou'd entirely lo&s;e all reli&s;h for their &s;tudies, and that tho' the con&s;equences be entirely indifferent to them; which &s;eems to be a contradiction.</P>
<P>TO remove this contradiction, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that there are certain de&s;ires and inclinations, which go no farther than the imagination, and are rather the faint &s;ha|dows and images of pa&s;&s;ions, than any real affections. Thus, &s;uppo&s;e a man, who takes a &s;urvey of the fortifications of any city; con&s;iders their &s;trength and advantages, na|tural or acquir'd; ob&s;erves the di&s;po&s;ition and contrivance of the ba&s;tions, ramparts, mines, and other military works; 'tis plain, that in proportion as all the&s;e are fitted to attain their ends, he will receive a &s;uitable
<PB N="312" REF="317">
plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction. This plea&s;ure, as it ari&s;es from the utility, not the form of the objects, can be no other than a &s;ym|pathy with the inhabitants, for who&s;e &s;e|curity all this art is employ'd; tho' 'tis po&s;|&s;ible, that this per&s;on, as a &s;tranger or an enemy, may in his heart have no kindne&s;s for them, or may even entertain a hatred again&s;t them.</P>
<P>IT may indeed be objected, that &s;uch a remote &s;ympathy is a very &s;light foundation for a pa&s;&s;ion, and that &s;o much indu&s;try and application, as we frequently ob&s;erve in philo&s;ophers, can never be deriv'd from &s;o incon&s;iderable an original. But here I re|turn to what I have already remark'd, that the plea&s;ure of &s;tudy con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the action of the mind, and the exerci&s;e of the genius and under&s;tanding in the di&s;covery or comprehen&s;ion of any truth. If the im|portance of the truth be requi&s;ite to com|pleat the plea&s;ure, 'tis not on account of any con&s;iderable addition, which of it&s;elf it brings to our enjoyment, but only becau&s;e 'tis, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, requi&s;ite to fix our attention. When we are carele&s;s and in|attentive, the &s;ame action of the under&s;tand|ing has no effect upon us, nor is able to
<PB N="313" REF="318">
convey any of that &s;atisfaction, which a|ri&s;es from it, when we are in another di&s;|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ide the action of the mind, which is the principal foundation of the plea&s;ure, there is likewi&s;e requir'd a degree of &s;ucce&s;s in the attainment of the end, or the di&s;covery of that truth we examine. Upon this head I &s;hall make a general re|mark, which may be u&s;eful on many oc|ca&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> that where the mind pur&s;ues any end with pa&s;&s;ion; tho' that pa&s;&s;ion be not deriv'd originally from the end, but merely from the action and pur&s;uit; yet by the natural cour&s;e of the affections, we ac|quire a concern for the end it&s;elf, and are unea&s;y under any di&s;appointment we meet with in the pur&s;uit of it. This pro|ceeds from the relation and parallel direction of the pa&s;&s;ions above-mention'd.</P>
<P>TO illu&s;trate all this by a &s;imilar in&s;tance, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that there cannot be two pa&s;&s;ions more nearly re&s;embling each other, than tho&s;e of hunting and philo&s;ophy, what|ever di&s;proportion may at fir&s;t &s;ight appear betwixt them. 'Tis evident, that the plea|&s;ure of hunting con&s;i&s;ts in the action of the mind and body; the motion, the attention,
<PB N="314" REF="319">
the difficulty, and the uncertainty. 'Tis evident likewi&s;e, that the&s;e actions mu&s;t be attended with an idea of utility, in order to their having any effect upon us. A man of the greate&s;t fortune, and the farthe&s;t re|mov'd from avarice, tho' he takes a plea|&s;ure in hunting after patridges and phea&s;ants, feels no &s;atisfaction in &s;hooting crows and magpies; and that becau&s;e he con&s;iders the fir&s;t as fit for the table, and the other as entirely u&s;ele&s;s. Here 'tis certain, that the utility or importance of it&s;elf cau&s;es no real pa&s;&s;ion, but is only requi&s;ite to &s;upport the imagination; and the &s;ame per&s;on, who over-looks a ten times greater profit in any other &s;ubject, is pleas'd to bring home half a dozen woodcocks or plovers, after having employ'd &s;everal hours in hunting after them. To make the parallel betwixt hunting and philo&s;ophy more compleat, we may ob&s;erve, that tho' in both ca&s;es the end of our ac|tion may in it&s;elf be de&s;pis'd, yet in the heat of the action we acquire &s;uch an at|tention to this end, that we are very unea&s;y under any di&s;appointments, and are &s;orry when we either mi&s;s our game, or fall into any error in our rea&s;oning.</P>

IF we want another parallel to the&s;e af|fections, we may con&s;ider the pa&s;&s;ion of gaming, which affords a plea&s;ure from the &s;ame principles as hunting and philo&s;ophy. It has been remark'd, that the plea&s;ure of gaming ari&s;es not from intere&s;t alone; &s;ince many leave a &s;ure gain for this entertain|ment: Neither is it deriv'd from the game alone; &s;ince the &s;ame per&s;ons have no &s;a|tisfaction, when they play for nothing: But proceeds from both the&s;e cau&s;es united, tho' &s;eparately they have no effect. 'Tis here, as in certain chymical preparations, where the mixture of two clear and tran&s;parent liquids produces a third, which is opaque and colour'd.</P>
<P>THE intere&s;t, which we have in any game, engages our attention, without which we can have no enjoyment, either in that or in any other action. Our attention be|ing once engag'd, the difficulty, variety, and &s;udden rever&s;es of fortune, &s;till farther intere&s;t us; and 'tis from that concern our &s;atisfac|tion ari&s;es. Human life is &s;o tire&s;ome a &s;cene, and men generally are of &s;uch indo|lent di&s;po&s;itions, that whatever amu&s;es them, tho' by a pa&s;&s;ion mixt with pain, does in the main give them a &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure. And
<PB N="316" REF="321">
this plea&s;ure is here encreas'd by the nature of the objects, which being &s;en&s;ible, and of a narrow compa&s;s, are enter'd into with fa|cility; and are agreeable to the imagina|tion.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame theory, that accounts for the love of truth in mathematics and algebra, may be extended to morals, politics, na|tural philo&s;ophy, and other &s;tudies, where we con&s;ider not the ab&s;tract relations of ideas, but their real connexions and exi&s;tence. But be&s;ide the love of knowledge, which di&s;plays it&s;elf in the &s;ciences, there is a certain curio&s;ity implanted in human nature, which is a pa&s;&s;ion deriv'd from a quite dif|ferent principle. Some people have an in|&s;atiable de&s;ire of knowing the actions and circum&s;tances of their neighbours, tho' their intere&s;t be no way concern'd in them, and they mu&s;t entirely depend on others for their information; in which ca&s;e there is no room for &s;tudy or application. Let us &s;earch for the rea&s;on of this phaenomenon.</P>
<P>IT has been prov'd at large, that the influence of belief is at once to inliven and infix any idea in the imagination, and pre|vent all kind of he&s;itation and uncertainty about it. Both the&s;e circum&s;tances are ad|vantageous.
<PB N="317" REF="322">
By the vivacity of the idea we intere&s;t the fancy, and produce, tho' in a le&s;&s;er degree, the &s;ame plea&s;ure, which ari&s;es from a moderate pa&s;&s;ion. As the vivacity of the idea gives plea&s;ure, &s;o its certainty prevents unea&s;ine&s;s, by fixing one particular idea in the mind, and keeping it from wavering in the choice of its ob|jects. 'Tis a quality of human nature, which is con&s;picuous on many occa&s;ions, and is common both to the mind and body, that too &s;udden and violent a change is unplea&s;ant to us, and that however any objects may in them&s;elves be indifferent, yet their alteration gives unea&s;ine&s;s. As 'tis the nature of doubt to cau&s;e a variation in the thought, and tran&s;port us &s;uddenly from one idea to another, it mu&s;t of con&s;equence be the occa&s;ion of pain. This pain chiefly takes place, where intere&s;t, relation, or the greatne&s;s and novelty of any event intere&s;ts us in it. 'Tis not every matter of fact, of which we have a curio&s;ity to be inform'd; neither are they &s;uch only as we have an intere&s;t to know. 'Tis &s;ufficient if the idea &s;trikes on us with &s;uch force, and concerns us &s;o nearly, as to give us an unea&s;ine&s;s in its in&s;tability and incon&s;tancy. A &s;tranger,
<PB N="318" REF="323">
when he arrives fir&s;t at any town, may be entirely indifferent about knowing the hi&s;|tory and adventures of the inhabitants; but as he becomes farther acquainted with them, and has liv'd any con&s;iderable time among them, he acquires the &s;ame curio&s;ity as the natives. When we are reading the hi&s;tory of a nation, we may have an ardent de&s;ire of clearing up any doubt or difficulty, that occurs in it; but become carele&s;s in &s;uch re&s;earches, when the ideas of the&s;e events are, in a great mea&s;ure, obliterated.</P>
