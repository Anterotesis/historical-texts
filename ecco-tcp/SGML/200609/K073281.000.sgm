<HEAD>THE VISION. A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>'TWAS on the fatal Day that claims a Sigh</L>
<L>From ev'ry Heart, a Tear from ev'ry Eye;</L>
<L>Ere <HI>Albion</HI>'s Joys were wholly &s;natch'd away,</L>
<L>Or <HI>Britons</HI> for their Queen forbid to pray:</L>
<L>While Hope and Fear contended in my Brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Intruding Sleep my weary Eyes oppre&s;t:</L>
<L>Wrapt in a Vi&s;ion,&mdash;where I cannot &s;ay,</L>
<L>Nor can the Mu&s;e the glorious Place di&s;play:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4">
It &s;eem'd &s;ome ble&s;&s;ed Angel's happy Sphere,</L>
<L>(Or ble&s;&s;ed Angels might inhabit there;)</L>
<L>For &s;ure the beauteous Scene did far excel,</L>
<L>What Heathen Bards of ble&s;t <HI>Ely&s;ium</HI> tell.</L>
<L>A Cloud of Glory &s;hone before my Face,</L>
<L>Which &s;hed refulgent Rays around the Place,</L>
<L>And &s;catter'd Colours, various to behold,</L>
<L>Here blu&s;hing Rubies, there the burni&s;h'd Gold.</L>
<L>As, wond'ring at the Scene, I gazing &s;tood,</L>
<L>(Struck with religious Awe, that chill'd my Blood)</L>
<L>I &s;aw BRITANNIA, with dejected Air,</L>
<L>Pale was her Face, di&s;hevell'd was her Hair:</L>
<L>Her trembling Hand had dropt the Laurel Bough,</L>
<L>A mournful Cypre&s;s wreath'd her pen&s;ive Brow:</L>
<L>Before the &s;hining Cloud &s;he pro&s;trate lay,</L>
<L>And thus &s;he pray'd, or &s;eem'd, at lea&s;t, to pray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" ALMIGHTY Father! who&s;e Commanding Pow'r,</L>
<L>Can ha&s;ten, or adjourn, the fatal Hour;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5">
Can lengthen, or contract, a Monarch's Reign,</L>
<L>Or rai&s;e the &s;ilent Dead to Life again:</L>
<L>Oh! &s;top thy threat'ning Arm, and &s;pare awhile</L>
<L>One &s;acred <HI>Life,</HI> &s;o precious to my I&s;le.</L>
<L>For Royal CAROLINA'S Health I &s;ue,</L>
<L>The be&s;t of Sov'reigns, and of Subjects too;</L>
<L>In ev'ry State her Goodne&s;s has been prov'd,</L>
<L>When rul'd, obedient; and when ruling, lov'd.</L>
<L>Securely ble&s;t, beneath her gentle Sway,</L>
<L>'Tis Happine&s;s to &s;erve, and Plea&s;ure to obey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOR fewer Charms adorn her private Life,</L>
<L>The tend're&s;t Mother, mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Wife;</L>
<L>Who never yet her Con&s;ort di&s;obey'd,</L>
<L>By Honour, Duty, Love, and Virtue &s;way'd:</L>
<L>In Virtue's Path &s;he con&s;tantly proceeds,</L>
<L>By Virtue's Rule &s;he mea&s;ures all her Deeds.</L>
<L>Ev'n now, tho' tortur'd with &s;evere&s;t Pains,</L>
<L>Her patient Tongue adores Thee, not complains.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6">
To Thee her ardent Pray'rs and Prai&s;es tend,</L>
<L>On Thee, on Thee alone, her Hopes depend;</L>
<L>Firm Faith and Patience fortify her Mind,</L>
<L>To live, indiff'rent; or to die, re&s;ign'd.</L>
<L>Yet &s;pare her longer from her heav'nly Throne;</L>
<L>Spare her, for others Good, tho' not her own.</L>
<L>Look down, and &s;ee her duteous Children's Tears;</L>
<L>Look down, and hear the be&s;t of Monarch's Pray'rs:</L>
<L>See, round her Bed her tender Offspring kneels,</L>
<L>While ev'ry Pang her Royal Con&s;ort feels.</L>
<L>Nor only <HI>They</HI> intreat Thee for her Breath,</L>
<L>Three Kingdoms beg Thee to avert her Death:</L>
<L>Religion, Learning, Art, and Science fear</L>
<L>To find a Period, and a Grave with Her.</L>
<L>For Her, the Widows weep a briny Tide;</L>
<L>For Her, who&s;e Bounty has their Lo&s;s &s;upply'd:</L>
<L>For Her, unhappy, helple&s;s Orphans mourn,</L>
<L>And &s;hed more Tears than o'er their Parents Urn;</L>
<L>Their Parents Death they need no longer grieve,</L>
<L>Might CAROLINE, their better Parent, live;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7">
Who feeds the Hungry, &s;uccours the Di&s;tre&s;t;</L>
<L>And from Oppre&s;&s;ion re&s;cues the Oppre&s;t.</L>
<L>Ev'n in the Height of Power her Power was &s;hown</L>
<L>In Acts of Love and Mercy like Thy own.</L>
<L>Oh! were She like Thee more in ev'ry State;</L>
<L>Oh! were She, were She, like Thee, free from Fate!</L>
<L>But <HI>That,</HI> alas! is not to Mortals giv'n;</L>
<L>Yet &s;urely <HI>This</HI> is in the Grant of Heav'n:</L>
<L>Increa&s;e her Days, re&s;tore her native Bloom,</L>
<L>Nor crop the Royal Fruit till <HI>Autumn</HI> come.</L>
<L>Few are the Years to Mortal Man a&s;&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>Ah! let not Her&mdash;to fewer be confin'd:</L>
<L>But &s;top thy threat'ning Arm, and &s;pare awhile</L>
<L>Her &s;acred Life, &s;o precious to my I&s;le."</L>
<L>She &s;aid: The Tears ran trickling as &s;he &s;poke;</L>
<L>While from the radiant Cloud the&s;e Accents broke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" BRITANNIA, cea&s;e thy fruitle&s;s Tears, and know,</L>
<L>One certain Day is fix'd for all below:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8">
That Day permit to Heav'n; for Heav'n alone</L>
<L>Knows when the noble Work of Virtue's done.</L>
<L>Few are the Years, you &s;ay, of human Kind;</L>
<L>But Years add nothing to the perfect Mind.</L>
<L>Improperly, by <HI>Time,</HI> you count the Date;</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>virtuous Actions</HI> make a Life complete.</L>
<L>Suppo&s;e the Sun, that chears your earthly Clime,</L>
<L>Should run his de&s;tin'd Cour&s;e in half the Time,</L>
<L>Performing all the Offices of Light,</L>
<L>Of Heat, of circling Sea&s;ons, Day and Night:</L>
<L>Say, Could you think his Race too &s;wiftly run?</L>
<L>Or, Could you call him an imperfect Sun?</L>
<L>Heav'n's greate&s;t Lord, that over All pre&s;ides;</L>
<L>Who rules that Sun, and all his Motions guides;</L>
<L>In Length of Years an Equal ne'er &s;urvey'd;</L>
<L>But is not <HI>therefore</HI> wor&s;hipp'd, or obey'd:</L>
<L>His <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> only claims that Tribute due;</L>
<L>His Goodne&s;s, not his <HI>Age,</HI> tho' ever New.</L>
<L>If then, your gracious Queen, tho' few her Days,</L>
<L>Has practis'd ev'ry Virtue worthy Prai&s;e,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9">
Worthy immortal Bli&s;s: What can &s;he more,</L>
<L>Tho' Heav'n again her former Health re&s;tore?</L>
<L>Tho' Heav'n a Thou&s;and added Years be&s;tow,</L>
<L>Her Soul can be no perfecter below.</L>
<L>'Tis Time She now &s;hould quit her mortal Throne,</L>
<L>To change an Earthly for a Heav'nly Crown.</L>
<L>And, &s;ee! She mounts Triumphant to the Skies,</L>
<L>Of all her Virtues reaps the glorious Prize!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>STARTING to hear the fatal Sentence &s;poke,</L>
<L>With trembling Joints, and &s;treaming Eyes, I 'woke.</L>
<L>When &s;trait I hear Complaints from ev'ry Tongue,</L>
<L>On ev'ry Face a Cloud of Sorrow hung:</L>
<L>Sad Sighs and Floods of fruitle&s;s Tears bemoan</L>
<L>The Noble&s;t Queen that ever grac'd a Throne.</L>
