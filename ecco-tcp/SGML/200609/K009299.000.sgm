<HEAD>THE
CONDUCT
Of &s;ome People, about
Pleading Guilty.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Commons</HI>
fir&s;t exhibited Impeachments
again&s;t the Seven Lords taken
at the Defeat of the Rebels at <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI>
and &s;ent the Articles again&s;t them up to
the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Lords,</HI> the Lords, according
to the u&s;ual Cour&s;e of Proceedings in
&s;uch Ca&s;es, appointed the Impeach'd
Lords to attend, and allow'd them Time
to give in their An&s;wer.</P>
<P>While this Part was depending, it was
the common Di&s;cour&s;e of the Town,
That giving them Time was but a piece
of needle&s;s Formality, a kind of Banter
upon their Circum&s;tances, a Thing of no
&s;ignification, that indeed it gain'd them a
few Days to Live, and to prepare for
another World, which was the only
Thing they ought to have in their View,
<PB N="4" REF="3">
but that it was of no other effect, <HI>For
what can they Plead?</HI> &s;aid the People,
who &s;poke of tho&s;e Things with any
Judgment, <HI>Were not they taken in Arms?
Were they not in open Rebelion, and made
Pri&s;oners in the Action, Surrendered at
Di&s;cretion to our Generalls, and brought
immediately bither from the very Place of
Battle? Can &s;uch Men bring any Plea?
What can they have to &s;ay?</HI></P>
<P>Tho' this was the Di&s;cour&s;e without
Doors, yet with the Per&s;ons them&s;elves
there was other Thoughts; and particu|larly
with their Friends; and the De|bates
that happened upon this Subject, as
well among them&s;elves as among other
People, may be very U&s;eful for us to
know &s;omething of, as well to let us in|to
the <HI>Secret Hi&s;tory</HI> of their <HI>Conduct,</HI> as
to inform us who were in their Intere&s;t,
and upon what Foot their Friends En|deavour'd
to Save them.</P>
<P>I believe no Man will &s;uppo&s;e, that
Gentlemen of &s;uch Quallity as the&s;e,
were without &s;ome Friends, who, in
their pre&s;ent Extremity, would Intere&s;t
them&s;elves for them, and who Apply'd,
with the uttermo&s;t Diligence, to gain to
them the Favour of &s;uch other Per&s;ons,
as might be &s;uppo&s;ed, on any Account
whatever, to be capable of Serving them.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
It was ea&s;ie to &s;ee who would Befriend
them of Cour&s;e; (<HI>viz.</HI>) Tho&s;e engaged
by Party, who were on their Side by In|clination,
the&s;e were not only to be de|pended
upon for their Votes in favour
of the Gentlemen in Di&s;tre&s;s, but to be
moved to u&s;e their Intere&s;t for the bring|ing
others, of a Second Party, who were
&s;omething Indifferent, over to the &s;ame
Sentiment. There was a Third Party,
from whom nothing was Expected, and
therefore to &s;uch little Application was
to be made, but they were, if po&s;&s;ible, to
be Out-Number'd.</P>
<P>The &s;pace the Criminal Gentlemen
had between their Commitment to the
<HI>Tower,</HI> and the Day of their Impeach|ment,
was the Time to be employ'd to
form tho&s;e Intere&s;ts, and to come to an
Under&s;tanding about the Strength of
their Friends; and as there were no Mo|ments
to be lo&s;t, &s;o neither was it ill
Employ'd; they took care to Sollicit,
Treat with, and Engage every Man, that
by any po&s;&s;ible Methods they could come
at, to act in their Intere&s;t, in &s;o Critical
a Juncture, and to do their Be&s;t for them,
if po&s;&s;ible to avert the Stroke of Ju&s;tice
at la&s;t; and for this no Body can blame
them. It was not many Days before the
Impeachments, that we were told, with
<PB N="6" REF="5">
great A&s;&s;urance, That the Lords in the
<HI>Tower</HI> had made &s;uch an Intere&s;t, that
they were under no apprehen&s;ions of
Dying at all, and that it only remain'd,
to Determine what Method &s;hould be
taken, to make the Mercy they were to
receive appear Rational in tho&s;e that
Granted it, and be Satisfactory to the
Nation.</P>
<P>And if it is True, that they had, upon
tho&s;e Applications, &s;ome private A&s;&s;u|rance
given them, That by the &s;trength
of their Intere&s;t among the Nobility, the
whole Hou&s;e of Lords would be brought
to Addre&s;s His Maje&s;ty to &s;hew them
Mercy, who can blame them for promi|&s;ing
them&s;elves their Lives, e&s;pecially
con&s;idering the native Clemency of His
Maje&s;ty, and the Inclination all good
Kings have to &s;pare the Blood of their
People.</P>
<P>But in all the&s;e Mea&s;ures, there has
been &s;o much Intriegue, &s;uch Nicety of
Management, &s;uch Subtilty of Applica|tion,
and &s;uch Indu&s;try u&s;ed on one
Hand, and &s;uch Court Finene&s;s, &s;uch
di&s;covery of Per&s;ons and Principles on
the other, that it mu&s;t be very Diver|ting,
as well as Improving, to give &s;ome
Account of it to the World.</P>
<P>The Mea&s;ures, as I have &s;aid, having
<PB N="7" REF="6">
been taken to form their Intere&s;t, and
tho&s;e Mea&s;ures having &s;ucceeded, even
beyond their Expectation, the fir&s;t thing
to be ob&s;erv'd is, How agreeable to all
good Men, and e&s;pecially to Men of Ho|nour
and Quality, it is to be apply'd to
for &s;hewing Mercy to Men in Di&s;tre&s;s,
in a Court &s;o Gallant, &s;o Soft, &s;o Hu|mane,
I had almo&s;t &s;aid &s;o Chri&s;tian, as
that of this Kingdom, what wonder is it,
that an humble Application, by Per&s;ons
of Honour under Misfortunes, found
powerful Advocates, and made &s;en&s;ible
Impre&s;&s;ions upon the Minds of &s;ome
Great Per&s;ons in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Clemency and Charity are the Glory,
the one of Nobility, the other of Chri|&s;tianity,
and when the&s;e are the power|ful
Arguments to be u&s;ed, when the&s;e are
the Keys, how ea&s;y is it to Unlock the
Brea&s;ts of &s;uch Per&s;ons who are fill'd
with Principles of Honour and Chri&s;tia|nity?
I had much rather give the&s;e for
the Rea&s;ons, why the Applications of the
Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Lords gain'd them &s;o ea&s;ie, and
&s;o general an acce&s;s to the Hearts of
&s;ome, who&s;e Po&s;ts and Tru&s;ts, perhaps,
might &s;eem to have Engaged them ano|ther
way; and of whom it might have
been expected, that their Concern for
the Safety and Peace of their Royal
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Ma&s;ter, the Honour of His Government,
and the Good of their Country, &s;hould
have open'd their Eyes to the nece&s;&s;ity
of Publick Ju&s;tice at that Time, than
have it to &s;ay of any, That it rather
opened their Ears to the Petitions of
tho&s;e who had put their Hands to the
horrid Work, of their Country's De|&s;truction,
and made them Interce&s;&s;ors
for tho&s;e who had rais'd a Civil War in
its Bowells, &s;triking at the Per&s;on and
Family of our Sovereign, the Founda|tion
of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, and at
the very Root of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I am very loth al&s;o to entertain an
Opinion &s;o gro&s;s in it &s;elf, and &s;o remote
from Charity, which neverthele&s;s &s;ome
have &s;tarted, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That it was li&s;ten|ing
to a frailer part of their Inclination,
which brought &s;ome Gentlemen into
this Matter: That all the Clemency of
their Tempers, and Softne&s;s of their Di&s;|po&s;itions,
would not have prevail'd over
their Sen&s;e of Duty, if there had not
been more glittering Motives, who&s;e
Power they had not &s;elf-denying Vertue
enough to re&s;i&s;t; Tho' if this was their
Temptation, I mu&s;t &s;till acquit the Ag|gre&s;&s;ors,
I mean the Lords in the <HI>Tower</HI>;
for who, in their Circum&s;tances, would
have &s;par'd their Ammunition where
<PB N="9" REF="8">
knew the Fort would be reduc'd by Un|dermining,
without the hazard of Stor|ming.</P>
<P>And
as on the one Hand I believe, at
lea&s;t hope, this is no more than a Slan|der
upon the Gentlemen, of whom it is
&s;poken, &s;o, I dare &s;ay, the Rea&s;ons &s;ome
People have to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch a thing, e|ven
to them&s;elves, are rather taken from
what they have formerly heard, of the
influence MONEY has had upon tho&s;e
Per&s;ons in Times pa&s;t, to lead them a|gain&s;t
Principle, than from any real In|telligence
they have now had of the
Fact.</P>
<P>It may be True, that the Su&s;picion is
encrea&s;ed by the Knowledge the World
has had of the contrary Di&s;po&s;ition of
the Per&s;ons &s;poken of in Days of old,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) How, in former Times, when the ad|mini&s;tration
of Publick Affairs has been
in &s;ome of their Hands, they have been
found as Deaf to the Importunities of
the Mi&s;erable, as Inexorable to &s;uppli|cating
Vertue, and di&s;tre&s;s'd Innocence,
as any <HI>A&s;ian</HI> Mute, commi&s;&s;ion'd to the
excerci&s;e of the Bow-String: How they
have been Eminent for vindictive Tem|pers,
and the Operations of the Spleen,
as any that have &s;ince acted their Parts;
and therefore it has been &s;aid, That it
mu&s;t be from &s;ome other Principle than
that of Humanity and Compa&s;&s;ion, that
<PB N="10" REF="9">
tho&s;e Per&s;ons, however Great, &s;hould be
prevail'd with to plead for Clemency
and Mercy to Men under the wor&s;t of
Circum&s;tances, and Sentenc'd for Crimes
which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, not only taint
their Honour and Families who are
Guilty, but mu&s;t ca&s;t &s;ome ju&s;t Re|proach
upon tho&s;e who Intere&s;t them|&s;elves
to Save them. But as tho&s;e are
but Sugge&s;tions, I &s;ay no more of them.</P>
<P>But to return to the Fact, as it &s;tands
Hi&s;torically in our view: Certain it is,
<HI>if Fame lye not,</HI> That the powerful Ap|plications
for Mercy for the&s;e Men,
whether by the influence of the Ladies
Tears, the &s;en&s;e of the Misfortunes of
&s;o many Per&s;ons of Quality, or any
meaner Importunities, <HI>I cannot &s;ay,</HI> had
found Means to make Impre&s;&s;ions upon
&s;ome nearer the Throne than they them|&s;elves
had, I believe, any hopes of; and
as this was an agreeable Surpi&s;e to the
Unfortunate Gentlemen, &s;o we &s;hall &s;ee
the le&s;s Rea&s;on to wonder at their fu|ture
Conduct on that Account, and this
is partly the Rea&s;on why I have entered
into this Part at the Beginning of this
Tract.</P>
<P>Nothing is more Certain, than that
before this the Lords &s;eeing little room
to expect any Intere&s;t could be made for
their E&s;cape, had entertain'd &s;erious
Thoughts of Dying, and were rather
<PB N="11" REF="10">
&s;omething Di&s;concerted, than otherwi&s;e
Determined, as to what An&s;wer they
&s;hould give to the Impeachments which
were brought again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Indeed, as &s;ome of them Expre&s;s'd it,
<HI>I mean one already Executed,</HI> they hard|ly
expected the Hou&s;e of Commons
would have given them&s;elves the trou|ble
of Impeachments, in a Ca&s;e which
was &s;o plain, and requir'd &s;o little Cere|mony,
but rather have let the Law take
its ordinary Cour&s;e, by Indictment and
Plea, and have left them to the Hou&s;e
of Peers, who mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have Con|demn'd
them.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid al&s;o, by &s;ome of their
Party, That the &s;ame Gentlemen had
re&s;olv'd to act what they call <HI>the Heroe,</HI>
(<HI>viz.</HI>) To have given the Fact in Evi|dence
at their Tryal, and ju&s;tify'd the
Rebellion upon Principles of <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI>;
the Foundations of which, <HI>like Bla&s;phe|mous
Tenets in Religious Di&s;putes,</HI> are
not fit to be Mentioned. That this had
been to have acted the De&s;peradoe, and
to have ca&s;t them&s;elves entirely away
beyond the reach of Mercy, and out of
the Power of Interce&s;&s;ors; nay, even
out of the Rational Power of the Royal
Clemency it&s;elf, is mo&s;t certain; how
it could Denominate them <HI>Heroes</HI> would
have been their bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;hew, I mu&s;t
acknowledge I do not &s;ee any thing of
that kind in it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
However, we found this Notion was
&s;o revitted in the Mind of one Per&s;on, if
of no other of them, that nothing could,
for &s;ome time, divert his Thoughts from
it; and we have divers Accounts of his
Conduct in that Part. How he talk'd of
Death, <HI>a la Cavalier</HI>: How he made the
Scaffold appear to his Fancy, no more
than a Scene in a Tragedy, which had
nothing in it but a Formality, to make
his pa&s;&s;ing off from the World a little
Judicial. How he thought that Death
there, could have no wor&s;e a Face than
it had in the Streets of <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> where he
had look'd on its Phyz with very little
Apprehen&s;ion, and was not at all afraid
to &s;ee it again.</P>
<P>As the&s;e were the Views which for
&s;ome time the&s;e Gentlemen had, &s;o nei|ther
were they ea&s;y to be brought to en|tertain
other Notions; Indeed when the
Time was Limited, that they were Obli|ged
to give in &s;ome Plea or other, and
that they began to look on the Thing
with a nearer, and, perhaps, a more &s;eri|ous
View, they appear'd not all alike
Determind'd; but all the Con&s;equence of
this was, That it only made them a little
more encliin'd to li&s;ten to the Advice of
their Council and Friends, and to Act
by &s;uch Mea&s;ures as Rea&s;on, and the
Nature of their Circum&s;tances call'd for.</P>
<P>This ended in their Pleading Guilty
<PB N="13" REF="12">
to the Impeachment, and throwing them|&s;elves,
in the mo&s;t Moving and Submi|&s;ive
Manner po&s;&s;ible, upon the King's
Mercy, imploring the Interce&s;&s;ion of their
Peers, who were their Judges, and of the
Commons, who were their Accu&s;ers, a
thing which, as is &s;aid, One of tho&s;e
now gone &s;aid, <HI>Was much more difficult</HI> to
do, <HI>than</HI> TO DIE.</P>
<P>I have heard many wi&s;e and good Men
&s;ay, That let the Ends, which the &s;aid
Gentlemen propo&s;ed to them&s;elves in it,
be what they would, that Plea was the
only Step they could have taken, entire|ly
to give Peace to their own Minds, and
have good Men believe they were re&s;to|red
to an hone&s;t and ju&s;t Principle; <HI>The
Fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e by it they had tryed the
only Step left them to &s;ave their Lives,
and which they could not po&s;&s;ible be ful|ly
&s;atisfy'd in omitting; and <HI>the La&s;t,</HI>
becau&s;e the Contrary had been a ju&s;tify|ing
and defending the Crime of Rebellion,
which on no ju&s;t Principle could be de|fended;
and, as I am well Informed,
the&s;e Arguments were pre&s;&s;ed upon them
with great Earne&s;tne&s;s by their Friends,
&s;o I have been told al&s;o, That the fir&s;t,
e&s;pecially, made a great impre&s;&s;ion upon
them, in the Ca&s;e I &s;peak of.</P>
<P>But there was a yet more powerful
Argument to induce them to this Plea,
and this is &s;aid to be repre&s;ented to them
<PB N="14" REF="13">
by the Agents they had employ'd as be|fore,
to obtain the Interce&s;&s;ion and Fa|vour
of the Great Per&s;ons, of which I
mentioned &s;omething at fir&s;t; and this
contains the be&s;t Piece of Secret Hi&s;tory,
which, perhaps, has come to light in all
this Affair.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e <HI>A. B.</HI> to be a Lady deeply in|tere&s;ted
in the Ca&s;e before us, and ap|plying
to one <HI>N. O.</HI> for his Intere&s;t and
Favour in Behalf of the Condemn'd
Lords, while other Friends are &s;olliciting
as hard with other Great Per&s;ons; let us
dige&s;t their Di&s;cour&s;e as near as we can
to the real Dialogue that pa&s;t between
them, allowing that we can relate no
more than Memory and our faithful In|telligence
could convey.</P>

You know he gave innumerable Evidences
of it formerly, in the Time of his Admini|&s;tration;
and if he has &s;eemingly appear'd
in another Intere&s;t now for &s;ome Time, you
know well the Motives inducing, and al&s;o
that it is with due Re&s;erves, and that he
waits only an Occa&s;ion to declare him&s;elf;
and you mu&s;t be content, if you will &s;ave
your Life, my Lord, now you are in their
Power, to do as my Lord</HI> N. O. <HI>does,</HI> viz.
<HI>Double and turn, and &s;hew the &s;mooth
Face, or the rough, as Occa&s;ion offers, and
I confe&s;s I do not &s;ee why you &s;hould make
it a Difficulty.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> as if he was &s;ur|priz'd,
return'd: <HI>No Difficulty, my Lord!
Do you con&s;ider that it is Perjury in the
Ab&s;tract; and tho' I am a Catholick, I
have no Di&s;pen&s;ation for breaking lawful</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="17">
<HI>Oaths; I ought to die, rather than enter|tain
a Thought of it.</HI> To this, <HI>L. R.</HI> re|turn'd
coldly, <HI>I am &s;orry for it, my Lord;
it is certain, if you cannot do this Part,
you mu&s;t dye, there is no Man living can
interpo&s;e for you.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eems, however, that Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> was
not willing either to leave the Point,
or to leave off the Di&s;cour&s;e, and there|fore
&s;till held him in Su&s;pence; <HI>My
Lord,</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>you may be &s;ure I am wil|ling
to &s;ave my Life, but can I be guilty of
Perjury? How can</HI> N. O. <HI>offer &s;uch a
Thing to me?</HI></P>
<P><HI>L. R.</HI> told him, He could not &s;ay <HI>how
far</HI> the&s;e Things might de&s;erve the Name
of Perjury, and brought in this famous
Argument; <HI>Do not we that are Prote&s;t|ants,</HI>
&s;ays he, <HI>as firmly adhere to the In|tere&s;t
of King</HI> J<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>as any of you, and
yet you &s;ee we are oblig'd to take all the
Oaths, Abjurations, A&s;&s;ociations,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>that
they put upon us.</HI></P>
<P>Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> told him gravely, He
could not enter into that Ca&s;e: <HI>I examine
no Man's Principles,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>but my own
I have always acted upon an honourable
Foot hitherto; and I think a Man of Ho|nour
can no more renounce his King than
his God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>L. R.</HI> &s;eem'd at a full Stop at this, as
indeed any Prote&s;tant might well be,
and as if the Ca&s;e was at a Point, reply'd,
<PB N="19" REF="18">
That he could not enter into a Di&s;pute
about Opinions, and Principles: <HI>But,</HI>
&s;ays he, <HI>if this cannot be, then I beg your

<P>My Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> not willing &s;till to

Que&s;tion: <HI>Why may not the Lords in|terpo&s;e
for Mercy to us after a Tryal, if
we are found Guilty?</HI></P>
<P>This di&s;covered his full De&s;ign: But
<HI>L. R.</HI> open'd the Ca&s;e more fully to his
Satisfaction, as follows: Says he, <HI>All that
are your Friends now, will, no doubt, do
&s;o, my Lord, but the Bu&s;ine&s;s lies another
Way: It mu&s;t not be a few Friends, but a
Majority of the Hou&s;e that can do you any
Service; and do you not think there will
be a manife&s;t Difference in the Inclination

<P>Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> &s;eem'd not to under&s;tand

<P>Why, &s;uppo&s;e, (<HI>&s;ays</HI> L. R.) on one Hand
you plead <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> ju&s;tify your &s;elves
from your Loyalty, <HI>as you call it,</HI> to the
Chevalier, which, by Con&s;equence, mu&s;t be
in the highe&s;t manner provoking to the
pre&s;ent Government, as it in&s;i&s;ts upon the
Title of their Enemy, and pretends to di&s;|own
the Settlement here: Do you think,
my Lord, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> as many will incline to
<PB N="20" REF="19">
Compa&s;&s;ion, and as many will think you
merit to be &s;par'd, as will be mov'd on the

this Ca&s;e &s;edately, my Lord.</P>
<P>Perhaps indeed (&s;ays my Lord) there
may be &s;ome Difference in that.</P>
<P><HI>A great deal, my Lord,</HI> (continued <HI>L.

for it: We are to work upon Humane Na|ture
in this Ca&s;e, not upon Party Princi|ples:
If the Hou&s;e were to go by Party,
you are lo&s;t: You mu&s;t not think that all

<P>My Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> as if he &s;eem'd to

And what mu&s;t I do el&s;e?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Why, my Lord,</HI> (&s;aid <HI>L. R.</HI>) <HI>if you plead

<P><HI>And mu&s;t I call him King and Maje&s;ty?</HI>
(&s;ays L. <HI>D.</HI>)</P>
<P><HI>It mu&s;t be &s;o, my Lord,</HI> (&s;ays <HI>L. R.</HI>)
<HI>there can be no putting in a Word for you,
unle&s;s you think fit to come this length;
and your Lord&s;hip knows it to be &s;o as

it.</HI> To which Lord <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI>&s;eem|ing

<P>Says L. <HI>R. I &s;ee, my Lord, the Nicety

to the re&s;t of the Noble Lords who are
your Fellow-Pri&s;oners, who, I fear, will

<P><HI>You &s;tab me with that Expre&s;&s;ion</HI>; re|ply'd
my Lord <HI>D. rather than they &s;hall
&s;uffer by me, I'll comply with any Thing,
tho' I would not for any Danger of my

<P><HI>L. R.</HI> told him, He knew that Thought
would touch his tender Part; that it
was indeed a Reflection which any Per|&s;on
of Honour would immediately make;
that it was hard to let our Opiniatre en|danger
the Lives, Honours, and E&s;tates

<P><PB N="22" REF="21">
To this, Lord <HI>D.</HI> as if yielding, &s;aid

<HI>and &s;everal other Per&s;ons of Honour, of
the fir&s;t Magnitude, have promi&s;ed to be&s;tir
them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But what is it they can do?</HI> &s;ays L. <HI>D.</HI>

<P><HI>Rather, my Lord,</HI> &s;ays the other, <HI>what

<P><HI>Yes, yes, my Lord</HI>; (&s;ays L. <HI>R.</HI>) <HI>you
know they have a Right to advi&s;e the

you will find, perhaps, they may be brought
to addre&s;s the King in Parliament to par|don
you, which if you can obtain, your Bu|&s;ine&s;s

an Example where any Per&s;on who the

<P><HI>Indeed,</HI> &s;ays L. <HI>D. the De&s;ign &s;eems

<P><HI>L. R.</HI> return'd; <HI>You may do &s;o, if you
plea&s;e; but we cannot an&s;wer for them in
this Ca&s;e; for tho' the Hou&s;e of Commons
do often make, or pa&s;s Acts of Oblivion,
yet in Ca&s;es thus particular, we do not find
often that the Hou&s;e relents. The Com|mons
are the Accu&s;ers, and are ju&s;tly in|cens'd
at the Rebellion; and they cannot
&s;o rea&s;onably concern them&s;elves to inter|po&s;e

not but it will be &s;ufficient in this Ca&s;e,
and we hope the Commons may be brought

<P>Says L. <HI>D. Well then, we mu&s;t for once
&s;toop to be</HI> Ro<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s<HI>, and deny our Prince

its better to come there gallantly, and with
the clear Soul of a Man of Honour, than
ba&s;ely loaded with Guilt and Confu&s;ion,

He &s;poke this with great Earne&s;tne&s;s,

<P>By &s;uch Arguments as the&s;e, and by

<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to Ob&s;erve here, That
after the&s;e Things were over, and the

very hand&s;omely, and Submitted in the

Lord&s;hips to Interpo&s;e with His Maje&s;ty
for Mercy to them, as by their Speeches,
which are made publick, and to which I
refer, may be &s;een; I &s;ay after this was
over, then the Moments &s;eem'd to be
come, in which the Promi&s;es of <HI>N. O.</HI>

be performed.</P>
<P>The Ladies, with all the mo&s;t Moving
<PB N="25" REF="24">
and Pa&s;&s;ionate Repre&s;entations, acted their
Part to perfection: None can &s;ay, They did
not do their Duty to the utmo&s;t; the Pow|erful
Intere&s;t they made among all the Men
of Influence, &s;hew'd they were not wanting:
All that Prayers and Tears could do, was
done without Doors; at length the Petition
was brought into the Hou&s;e of Lords, and
being Receiv'd, it introduced a Debate.</P>
<P>I am not allow'd to take notice of any
Thing that was Tran&s;acted within the
Hou&s;e, other than by Generals, to wit,
That their Friends did all that could be ex|pected
of them, and that it was po&s;&s;ible to
do; and &s;o far has Clemency, and a Merci|ful
Di&s;po&s;ition, the a&s;cendant over the No|ble
Per&s;ons who compo&s;e that Illu&s;trious Bo|dy,
that tho&s;e Lords who &s;poke in Favour of
the Condemn'd Lords, had great Advan|tages,
few caring to interpo&s;e, to put a &s;top
to the Royal Goodne&s;s, or ob&s;truct the
Channel of Mercy to the Mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>This, we may &s;uppo&s;e, favour'd their
Petition; and the Lords agreed to addre&s;s
his Maje&s;ty for Mercy, with &s;uch a Re&s;erve
to his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure and their Conduct,
as might tell them however, that there
was yet &s;omething farther to be look'd for
from them, if they expected Mercy: How
this was expre&s;s'd, is to be &s;een in the Ad|dre&s;s,
to which we refer.</P>
<P>The Condemn'd Lords, it was &s;aid, did
<PB N="26" REF="25">
not receive the News of this Addre&s;s with
that Plea&s;ure that their Friends, who &s;aw
not &s;o far into it as &s;ome of them did, expe|cted;
which, perhaps, was the Rea&s;on why
one &s;aid of them too warmly, That they
were not grateful to their Friends.</P>
<P>Nor did they receive it all alike, &s;ome
who penetrated into Things farther than
others, &s;eeing, perhaps, Room for their De|liverance
in it, and others ju&s;t the contrary;
&s;o that while this Addre&s;s put &s;ome of
them in Hopes that they might <HI>De&s;erve</HI>
Mercy, and con&s;equently have room to ex|pect
it, others of them &s;aw room only to
de&s;pair this <HI>De&s;erving Mercy,</HI> being a Term
which they had different Notions of from
other Men.</P>
<P>It began now to appear to them, that they
were deceived, when they thought that
<HI>The Bitterne&s;s of Death was pa&s;t</HI>; That the
Peers, tho' they were prevail'd with to har|bour
&s;ome merciful Di&s;po&s;itions towards
them, were very far from offering to im|po&s;e
upon the Government, or to pre&s;s for
Mercy, but on &s;uch expre&s;s Terms as his
Maje&s;ty &s;hould find to be for the Honour
of his Government, and the Safety of his
Kingdom: So that it remain'd for the&s;e

they were proper Objects of Mercy, before

<P>The Speech, or Paper, left behind by the

in Words, yet intimates very plainly, That
there has been a long Train of Trea&s;ons;
a &s;ecret Management of Parties and Per|&s;ons
in the Preparing the late Rebellion,
and Concerting Mea&s;ures for it; and that
there appeared a great De&s;ire in &s;ome Peo|ple
to have it out; and, no doubt, it is
the true Intere&s;t of the pre&s;ent Govern|ment
to di&s;cover tho&s;e Things; and the
Di&s;covery whereof might indeed contribute
to the Preventing more of the&s;e unhappy

to their Friends: That the&s;e Gentle|men
were privy to, and partly in tho&s;e
Trea&s;ons, there is little Rea&s;on to que&s;tion;
what el&s;e can be the Meaning of the Words
in the Lord <HI>Der<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> Speech, that <HI>Some</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="27">
<HI>Means have been propo&s;ed to me for Saving
my Life, which I look'd on as incon&s;i&s;tent
with Honour and Con&s;cience, and therefore I
rejected them.</HI> It is evident then that he
was able to have complyed with the means
propo&s;ed, otherwi&s;e it would have been a
Prevarication to &s;ay, That <HI>Therefore he re|jected
them</HI>; if he had been uncapable to
have complyed, if he had not been in the
&s;aid Train of Trea&s;ons, if he had not been
able to make Di&s;coveries, he could with
more Truth, and much more to his own
Vindication, have &s;aid, that it was not in
his Power, and that <HI>therefore</HI> tho&s;e Propo|&s;als
were ineffectual to him.</P>
<P>But while, on the other Hand, he re|jected
the Propo&s;al that was made to him,
by which his Life might have been &s;a|ved;
Who was cruel to my Lord <HI>Der|wentwater</HI>
but my Lord <HI>Derwentwater?</HI>
And who cau&s;ed him to be executed, the
King or him&s;elf?</P>
<P>It is not worth while to examine here
what he calls incon&s;i&s;tent with Honour
and Con&s;cience: If it was not incon&s;i&s;tent
with his Honour and Con&s;cience to ri&s;e in
Arms, that is as far as lay in him to De|po&s;e,
Murther, and De&s;troy the King, and
all his Royal Family; It cannot be in|con&s;i&s;tent
with the greate&s;t Clemency in
his Maje&s;ty to bring &s;uch to the Block.
But on the other Hand, it was the highe&s;t
<PB N="29" REF="28">
Te&s;timony imaginable of Royal Clemen|cy,
to offer &s;uch Men their Lives upon
their Te&s;tifying their Sorrow for the
Crime, by giving a true and faithful Con|fe&s;&s;ion
of all the Parts of the De&s;ign, as far
as they were really concern'd in it: While
they deny this, what Token of Contrition,
what Satisfaction of future Loyalty can
they give? They pleaded Guilty, <HI>&s;ay their
Party,</HI> and threw them&s;elves upon Mercy,
and &s;uch are generally thought more proper
Objects of Mercy than others: But let us
examine what is meant here by Pleading
Guilty, for except only the Form, I deny
that they <HI>pleaded Guilty</HI> at all.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Derwentwater</HI> very ingenu|ou&s;ly
explains what he under&s;tands by his
Pleading Guilty, it is in his Speech at the
Bar, the 13th of <HI>February</HI>: <HI>The &s;aid Earl
acknowledges with a real Sorrow, that at
the Time in the Articles mentioned, he was
in Arms, and with others did march thro',
and invade &s;everal Parts of this Kingdom.</HI>
The Law indeed accepts this as Pleading
Guilty, becau&s;e the Fact being acknow|ledg'd,
the Law determines from it both
the Guilt and the Penalty. But what's
this towards a Penitent, or towards &s;uch
a Confe&s;&s;ion as mu&s;t merit Pardon.</P>
<P>When a Pri&s;oner pleads Guilty to the
Judge, he needs to own nothing but the
<PB N="30" REF="29">
Fact, the Court, as I &s;aid, determines all
the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But when a Pri&s;oner pleads Guilty to
his offended Prince, to move and implore
his Clemency and Mercy, it is not the
Fact but the Crime that he mu&s;t charge
him&s;elf with; it behoves him to come and
acknowledge it thus: SIR, <HI>I own my &s;elf
a Rebel to you ju&s;t Authority; I am now
willing to become your faithful Subject, to
Recognize your Authority, and confe&s;s all my
Rebellion.</HI></P>
<P>But in all the&s;e Gentlemen's Pleading
Guilty, there is not one Word of Confe&s;|&s;ing
the CRIME, tho' there is of Con|fe&s;&s;ing
the Fact, that they were in Arms,
but do not own that they were Rebels:
Nay, my Lord <HI>Kenmure</HI> is &s;o hone&s;t, <HI>if the
Paper &s;aid to be left behind him be Genuine,</HI>
as to acknowledge he prevaricated in his
Pleading <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>Now let any Divine tell us, nay even
let a Popi&s;h Prie&s;t tell us, if this be &s;ound
in Divinity. Does God Him&s;elf Pardon
any Sinners that does not Confe&s;s their
Offences, or that Confe&s;s one part, but will
not Confe&s;s all? What claim to Mercy
can any Chri&s;tian make, upon any Scrip|tures
foundation but upon a FULL and
Sincere Confe&s;&s;ion, I &s;ay FULL and Sin|cere;
<HI>He that hides his Sin &s;hall not Pro&s;|per:</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="30">
<HI>But he that Confe&s;&s;es, and For&s;akes,
&s;hall find Mercy.</HI> Prov. 28. 13.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e Gentlemen have indeed Con|fe&s;s'd
the Fact, and <HI>what is there in that?</HI>
Were they not Evident, and ea&s;y to be Pro|ved?
Was it in their power to Deny any
Part? Were they not all taken in the Field
of Battle, with the Sword of Rebellion in
their Hands? What thanks to them for that
Plea? But if they had come ingenuou&s;ly
and confe&s;s'd <HI>the Trea&s;on,</HI> acknowledg'd <HI>the
Crime</HI> of it, laid open the Train of it, given
in a FULL Account of the Ri&s;e and Pro|gre&s;s
of it; and then have expre&s;s'd their
Sorrow that they &s;hould be Guilty of &s;uch
a horrid Crime; had this been done, and
Mercy had been refu&s;ed them, indeed they
would have had &s;ome room to talk of Se|verity,
<HI>tho' none then of Inju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>But this way of Confe&s;&s;ing does not, in
my Opinion, reach the Ca&s;e at all, they
have made no Confe&s;&s;ion of the Rebellion,
tho' they have of their being in Arms; in
a word, they have acknowledg'd them&s;elves
Rebells in or Sen&s;e, but they have not ack|nowledg'd
that <HI>they are &s;en&s;ible</HI> of their be|ing
Rebells; or that it is Rebellion in their
Own Sen&s;e; and pray what does all this
amount to? For my &s;hare I do not &s;ee they
have pleaded Guilty with any View but
that of the Scaffold.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31">
The Confe&s;&s;ion of a Penitent is quite a|nother
thing, his confe&s;&s;ion will be Com|pleat,
will be Sincere, and he will be more
afflicted for the Crime, than the Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Again, he that confe&s;&s;es his Guilt, mu&s;t
confe&s;s <HI>all</HI> his Guilt, and <HI>all</HI> his Trea&s;on;
and he cannot be &s;aid to make an ingenuous
Confe&s;&s;ion that conceals any thing he
knows, which may be for the Detecting
the Trea&s;on, if any Part lies conceal'd, or
that may be for the Safety and Advantage
of the Prince, again&s;t whom he has offended.</P>
<P>And here comes in the Objection, This is
again&s;t my Honour and Con&s;cience, becau&s;e
it will Impeach my Friends, break the
wicked Compact, the Engagement, or Oath
of Secre&s;y taken with other Traytors, <HI>and
what then?</HI> The Con&s;equence is, <HI>he takes
his Word again,</HI> as the <HI>Scots</HI> call it, relap&s;es
to a Rebel in Inclination, and begs par|don
that he has acknowledge'd that little
that he has.</P>
<P>In a word, if the&s;e Gentlemen were not
&s;par'd, it was becau&s;e they would have
their Lives upon their own Terms, or not
at all; they would have Mercy &s;hewn to
them for Sins unconfe&s;s'd; is there any
one of them that has given a full Narrative
of all the Trea&s;ons they have Committed?
They have acknowledg'd the capital Part
indeed, which, as we may &s;ay, they could
not avoid, or get clear of; but what el&s;e
<PB N="33" REF="32">
have they Confe&s;s'd? Have they told the
Government any one thing which they
did not know before? Had my Lord <HI>Der|wentwater</HI>
made &s;uch an ingenuous Ack|nowledgment
of all he knew of the Rebel|lion,
I am bold to &s;ay, he would have
Merited &s;ome Mercy, and for that Rea&s;on
I believe he would have found it.</P>
<P>But this manner of Confe&s;&s;ion, &s;ay they,
would have betray'd Friends, brought
Great Men and Great Families to Ruin;
and, perhaps, a great many of them too;
and it is below the Honour of a Nobleman
to turn Informer.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;h'd &s;uch Men would put
the Circum&s;tances they have brought them|&s;elves
to into the Ballance, and con&s;ider that
with the Point of Honour they &s;peak of:
If they had &s;tood out either in their De|fence,
or if, after Conviction, had re&s;olv'd
to meet Death as from the Hand of an
Enemy, then indeed it could not be ex|pected
that they &s;hould make any &s;uch
Thing as a Confe&s;&s;ion. But when they
lie pro&s;trate at the Foot of Maje&s;ty, Con|demn'd
by the Law, Acknowledging the
Fact, and Imploring Mercy, this is quite
another Thing; and that the&s;e Men &s;hould
reject the Conditions upon which Mercy
was offered them, this is perfectly incon&s;i&s;t|ent
with the nature of their Submi&s;&s;ion, and
aggravates the Crime they were guilty of
<PB N="34" REF="33">
before, and makes the Nece&s;&s;ity of dealing
with them in a Cour&s;e of &s;trict Ju&s;tice;
and this may be another Rea&s;on again&s;t
Mercy.</P>
<P>It is below the Maje&s;ty of the Govern|ment
to name the Folly and Madne&s;s of
their Friends as a Rea&s;on for their Execu|tion,
and yet it de&s;erves &s;ome Notice too:
No &s;ooner were the&s;e Men, with the re&s;t
of the <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> Pri&s;oners, come up, and had
been a little while in Pri&s;on, but their
Friends laugh'd loudly at the Govern|ment,
telling them in their Teeth, that
they dur&s;t not put them to Death; as if
the Power that was able to break them in
the Field, &s;hould not be able to puni&s;h
them when in Pri&s;on. But &s;o prepo&s;terous
have they been in this Part, that they have
pu&s;ht the Government almo&s;t upon the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of bringing them to the Block, to
&s;atisfy the World that they dare do it.</P>
<P>This is very hard upon their Friends,
and has made their being brought to the
Block very rea&s;onable in the pre&s;ent Go|vernment,
if not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and
it is worth while for them to con&s;ider it on
&s;everal Accounts: (1.) How ju&s;t the King
had been to have executed many more, and
have given that In&s;olence of their Friends
as the Rea&s;on of it. And (2.) Whether
tho' for Time pa&s;t it has not been done;
yet that if the King &s;hould think fit to
<PB N="35" REF="34">
execute &s;ome meerly upon the Importunity
of this Circum&s;tance, who otherwi&s;e his
Maje&s;ty's Goodne&s;s might incline him to
pardon; I &s;ay, whether their Blood, tho'
not innocent, would not be &s;o to tho&s;e
People, and be laid at their Door.</P>
<P>In the mean time, there is a more forci|ble
Rea&s;on &s;till to give why his Maje&s;ty
may not have thought fit to extend that
Mercy to the&s;e Men, which otherwi&s;e,
perhaps, they might have found; <HI>viz.</HI>
The continued Threatenings of the Party
&s;till to renew their Attempts, to return
with a greater Force, and to revive the Re|bellion,
promi&s;ing to re&s;cue their Sufferers
out of the Hand of publick Ju&s;tice, and
to return the Treatment they have met
with.</P>
<P>Let any one judge whether a threaten|ing
Enemy is an Object of Mercy; and
whether it would con&s;i&s;t with the Honour
of his Maje&s;ty's Government, and the
Safety of his Kingdom, to pardon Enemies
that are In&s;ulting him when out of his
Hands, and Conditioning with him even
when they are in.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allow'd, that Clemency is the
Glory of a King, and Mercy the Honour
of his Government: But Clemency is to
be directed by Wi&s;dom, as the Sword is to
be managed by Council. Rebellious Sub|jects
<HI>unhumbled,</HI> can never be the proper
<PB N="36" REF="35">
Subject of the Prince's Clemency: Neither
is Ju&s;tice executed upon ob&s;tinate Rebels
any Breach of Moderation in Government.</P>
<P>And how is a Rebel humbled, that
owns not his Rebellion to be a Crime?
How is he an Object of Mercy, that will
not accept of his Life but upon his own
Conditions? It's time to Capitulate when
they are not in the Hands of Ju&s;tice. My
Lord <HI>Nithi&s;dale,</HI> who has made his E&s;cape,
is in a much proper Po&s;ture to a&s;k Mercy
after the manner they did, than they were.
He that implores Mercy, mu&s;t fir&s;t put
him&s;elf into the Condition that denominates
him a proper Object of Mercy, or he has
but little Rea&s;on to expect it.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, no doubt, has yet more
and more forcible Rea&s;ons for not Granting
the Mercy that was petitioned for to the
late Lord <HI>Derwentwater, &amp;c.</HI> but if not, I
cannot think but the&s;e will make it evident
to all the World, that it was not rea&s;ona|ble
for them to expect Mercy in the Cir|cum&s;tances
they were in, or &s;afe for his
Maje&s;ty to grant it. I hope tho&s;e who are
left, will take Care to behave more &s;uitable
to their own Intere&s;t, and to de&s;erve better
the Mercy they expect.</P>
