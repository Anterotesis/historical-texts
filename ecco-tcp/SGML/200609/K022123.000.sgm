<P>Of the General Principles of MORALS.</P>
<P>DISPUTES with Per&s;ons, pertinaciou&s;ly
ob&s;tinate in their Principles, are, of all
others, the mo&s;t irk&s;ome; except, per|haps,
tho&s;e with Per&s;ons, who really do not believe
at all the Opinion they defend, but engage in the
Controver&s;y, from Affectation, from a Spirit of Op|po&s;ition,
or from a De&s;ire of &s;howing Wit and Inge|nuity,
&s;uperior to the re&s;t of Mankind. The &s;ame
blind Adherence to their own Arguments is to be ex|cepted
in both; the &s;ame Contempt of their Antago|ni&s;ts;
and the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ionate Vehemence, in inforc|ing
Sophi&s;try and Fal&s;hood. And as rea&s;oning is
not the Source, whence either Di&s;putant derives his
Tenets; 'tis in vain to expect, that any Logic, which
&s;peaks not to the Affections, will ever engage him to
embrace &s;ounder Principles.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="6">
THOSE who have refu&s;ed the Reality of moral
Di&s;tinctions, may be ranked in the latter Cla&s;s, a|mong&s;t
the di&s;ingenuous Di&s;putants; nor is it con|ceivable,
that any human Creature could ever &s;eri|ou&s;ly
believe, that all Characters and Actions were
alike entitled to the Affection and Regard of every
one. The Difference, which Nature has plac'd be|twixt
one Man and another, is &s;o wide, and this
Difference is &s;till &s;o much farther widened, by Educa|tion,
Example, and Habit, that, where the oppo&s;ite
Extremes come at once under our Apprehen&s;ion,
there is no Sceptici&s;m &s;o &s;crupulous, and &s;carce any
A&s;&s;urance &s;o determin'd, as ab&s;olutely to deny all
Di&s;tinction betwixt them. Let a Man's In&s;en&s;ibility
be ever &s;o great, he mu&s;t often be touch'd with the
Images of RIGHT and WRONG; and let his
Prejudices be ever &s;o ob&s;tinate, he mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that
others are &s;u&s;ceptible of like Impre&s;&s;ions. The only
Way, therefore, of converting an Antagoni&s;t of this
Kind, is to leave him to him&s;elf. For, finding that
No-body keeps up the Controver&s;y with him, 'tis
probable he will, at la&s;t, of him&s;elf, from mere
Wearine&s;s, come over to the Side of common Sen&s;e
and Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THERE has been a Controver&s;y &s;tarted of late,
much better worth Examination, concerning the
<PB N="3" REF="7">
general Foundation of MORALS, whether they
are derived from REASON or from SENTI|MENT;
whether we attain the Knowledge of
them by a Chain of Argument and Deduction, or by
an immediate Feeling and finer internal Sen&s;e; whe|ther,
like all &s;ound Judgment of Truth and Fal&s;hood,
they &s;hould be the &s;ame in every rational intelligent
Being; or whether, like the Perception of Beauty
and Deformity, they are founded entirely on the par|ticular
Fabric and Con&s;titution of the human Species.</P>
<P>THE antient Philo&s;ophers, tho' they often affirm,
that Virtue is nothing but Conformity to Rea&s;on, yet,
in general, &s;eem to con&s;ider Morals as deriving their
Exi&s;tence from Ta&s;te and Sentiment. On the other
Hand, our modern Enquirers, tho' they al&s;o talk
much of the Beauty of Virtue, and Deformity of
Vice, yet have commonly endeavoured to account
for the&s;e Di&s;tinctions by metaphy&s;ical Rea&s;onings,
and by Deductions from the mo&s;t ab&s;tract Principles
of human Under&s;tanding. Such Confu&s;ion reign'd
in the&s;e Subjects, that an Oppo&s;ition of the greate&s;t
Con&s;equence could prevail betwixt one Sy&s;tem and
another, and even in the Parts almo&s;t of each indivi|dual
Sy&s;tem; and yet No-body, till very lately, was
ever &s;en&s;ible of it. The elegant and &s;ublime Lord
<HI>Shaftesbury,</HI> who fir&s;t gave Occa&s;ion to remark this
Di&s;tinction, and who, in general, adher'd to the
<PB N="4" REF="8">
Principles of the Antients, is not, him&s;elf, entirely
free from the &s;ame Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be acknowledged, that both Sides of the
Que&s;tion are &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;pecious Arguments.
Moral Di&s;tinctions, it may be &s;aid, are di&s;cernible by
pure <HI>Rea&s;on:</HI> El&s;e, whence the many Di&s;putes, that
reign, in common Life, as well as in Philo&s;ophy,
with regard to this Subject: The long Chain of Proofs
often adduc'd on both Sides; the Examples cited, the
Authorities appeal'd to, the Analogies employ'd, the
Fallacies detected, the Inferences drawn, and the &s;e|veral
Conclu&s;ions adju&s;ted to their proper Principles.
Truth is di&s;putable; not, Ta&s;te: What exi&s;ts in the
Nature of Things is the Standard of our Judgment;
what each Man feels within him&s;elf is the Standard
of Sentiment. Propo&s;itions in Geometry may be
prov'd, Sy&s;tems in Phy&s;ics may be controverted;
but the Harmony of Ver&s;e, the Tenderne&s;s of Pa&s;&s;ion,
the Brilliancy of Wit mu&s;t give immediate Plea&s;ure.
No Man rea&s;ons concerning another's Beauty; but
frequently concerning the Ju&s;tice or Inju&s;tice of his
Actions. In every Trial of Criminals, their fir&s;t Ob|ject
is to di&s;prove the Facts alledged, and deny the
Actions imputed to them: The &s;econd to prove, that
even if the&s;e Actions were real, they might be ju&s;tified,
as innocent and lawful. 'Tis confe&s;&s;edly by Deduc|tions
of the Under&s;tanding, that the fir&s;t Point is a&s;|certain'd:
<PB N="5" REF="9">
How can we &s;uppo&s;e, that a different Fa|culty
of the Mind is employ'd in fixing the other?</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, tho&s;e, who would re&s;olve all
moral Determinations into <HI>Sentiment,</HI> may endeavour
to &s;how, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for Rea&s;on ever to draw
Conclu&s;ions of this Nature. To Virtue, &s;ay they,
it belongs to be <HI>amiable,</HI> and Vice <HI>odious.</HI> This forms
their very Nature or E&s;&s;ence. But can Rea&s;on or Ar|gumentation
di&s;tribute the&s;e different Epithets to any
Subjects, and pronounce <HI>a priori,</HI> that this mu&s;t pro|duce
Love, and that Hatred? Or what other Rea|&s;on
can we ever a&s;&s;ign for the&s;e Affections, but the
original Fabric and Formation of the human Mind,
which is naturally adapted to receive them?</P>
<P>THE End of all moral Speculations is to teach us
our Duty; and by proper Repre&s;entations of the De|formity
of Vice and Beauty of Virtue, beget cor|re&s;pondent
Habits, and engage us to avoid the one,
and embrace the other. But is this ever to be ex|pected
from Inferences and Conclu&s;ions of the Un|der&s;tanding,
which, of them&s;elves, have no Hold of
the Affections, nor &s;et the active Powers of Men in
Motion and Employment? They di&s;cover Truth;
but where the Truths they di&s;cover are indifferent,
and beget no De&s;ire or Aver&s;ion, they can have no
Influence on Conduct and Behaviour. What is ho|nourable,
<PB N="6" REF="10">
what is fair, what is becoming, what is
noble, what is generous, takes Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Heart,
and animates us to embrace and to maintain it. What
is intelligible, what is evident, what is probable,
what is true, procures only the cool A&s;&s;ent of the Un|der&s;tanding;
and gratifying a &s;peculative Curio&s;ity,
puts an end to our Re&s;earches.</P>
<P>EXTINGUISH all the warm Feelings and Prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions
in favour of Virtue, and all Di&s;gu&s;t or Aver&s;ion
again&s;t Vice: Render Men totally indifferent towards
the&s;e Di&s;tinctions; and Morality is no longer a prac|tical
Study, nor has any Tendency to regulate our
Lives and Actions.</P>
<P>THESE Arguments on both Sides (and many more
might be adduc'd) are &s;o plau&s;ible, that I am apt to
&s;u&s;pect they may, both of them, be &s;olid and &s;atis|factory,
and that <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Sentiment</HI> concur in al|mo&s;t
all moral Determinations and Conclu&s;ions.
The final Sentence, 'tis probable, which pronounces
Characters and Actions amiable or odious, prai&s;e|worthy
or blameable; that which &s;tamps on them
the Mark of Honour or Infamy, Approbation or
Cen&s;ure; that which renders Morality an active Prin|ciple,
and con&s;titutes Virtue our Happine&s;s, and Vice
our Mi&s;ery: 'Tis probable, I &s;ay, that this final
Sentence depends on &s;ome internal Sen&s;e or Feeling,
<PB N="7" REF="11">
which Nature has made univer&s;al to the whole
Species. For what el&s;e can have an Influence of this
Nature? But, in order to pave the Way for &s;uch a
Sentiment, and give Men a proper Di&s;cernment of
its Object, 'tis often nece&s;&s;ary, we find, that much
Rea&s;oning &s;hould precede, that nice Di&s;tinctions
he made, ju&s;t Conclu&s;ions drawn, di&s;tant Compari&s;ons
form'd, accurate Relations examin'd, and general
Facts fix'd and a&s;certain'd. Some Species of Beauty,
e&s;pecially the natural Kinds, on their fir&s;t Appear|ance,
command our Affection, and Approbation;
and where they fail of this Effect, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for
any Rea&s;oning to redre&s;s their Influence, or adapt
them better to our Ta&s;te and Sentiment. But in many
Orders of Beauty, particularly tho&s;e of the finer
Arts, 'tis requi&s;ite to employ much Rea&s;oning, in
order to feel the proper Sentiment; and a fal&s;e Reli&s;h
may frequently be corrected by Argument and Re|flection.
There are ju&s;t Grounds to conclude, that
moral Beauty partakes much of this latter Species,
and demands the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of our intellectual Fa|culties,
in order to give it a &s;uitable Influence on the
human Mind.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this Que&s;tion, concerning the general
Principle of Morals, be extremely curious and im|portant;
'tis needle&s;s for us, at pre&s;ent, to employ
farther Care in our Enquiries concerning it. For if
we can be &s;o happy, in the Cour&s;e of this Enquiry,
<PB N="8" REF="12">
as to fix the ju&s;t Origin of Morals, 'twill then ea&s;ily
appear how far Sentiment or Rea&s;on enters into all
Determinations of this Nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix Fir&s;t.</NOTE>. Mean while, it
will &s;carce be po&s;&s;ible for us, 'ere this Controver&s;y is
fully decided, to proceed in that accurate Manner,
requir'd in the Sciences; by beginning with exact
Definitions of VIRTUE and VICE, which are
the Objects of our pre&s;ent Enquiry. But we &s;hall do
what may ju&s;tly be e&s;teem'd as &s;atisfactory. We &s;hall
con&s;ider the Matter as an Object of Experience.
We &s;hall call <HI>every Quality or Action of the Mind,</HI> vir|tuous,
<HI>which is attended with the general Approbation
of Mankind:</HI> And we &s;hall denominate vicious, <HI>every
Quality, which is the Object of general Blame or Cen|&s;ure.</HI>
The&s;e Qualities we &s;hall endeavour to collect;
and after examining, on both Sides, the &s;everal
Circum&s;tances, in which they agree, 'tis hop'd we
may, at la&s;t, reach the Foundation of Ethics, and
find tho&s;e univer&s;al Principles, from which all moral
Blame or Approbation is ultimately derived. As
this is a Que&s;tion of Fact, not of ab&s;tract Science,
we can only expect Succe&s;s, by following this expe|rimental
Method, and deducing general Maxims from
a Compari&s;on of particular In&s;tances. The other
&s;cientifical Method; where a general ab&s;tract Prin|ciple
is fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and is afterwards branch'd
<PB N="9" REF="13">
out into a Variety of Inferences and Conclu&s;ions,
may be more perfect in it&s;elf, but &s;uits le&s;s the Im|perfection
of human Nature, and is a common
Source of Illu&s;ion and Mi&s;take, in this as well as in
other Subjects. Men are now cured of their Pa&s;&s;ion
for Hypothe&s;es and Sy&s;tems in natural Philo&s;ophy,
and will hearken to no Arguments but tho&s;e deriv'd
from Experience. 'Tis full Time they &s;hould begin
a like Reformation in all moral Di&s;qui&s;itions; and
reject every Sy&s;tem of Ethics, however &s;ubtile or in|genious,
that is not founded on Fact and Ob&s;erva|tion.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of BENEVOLENCE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a Principle, &s;uppos'd to prevail a|mong&s;t
many, which is utterly incompatible
with all Virtue or moral Sentiment; and as it can
proceed from nothing but the mo&s;t deprav'd Di&s;po|&s;ition,
&s;o in its Turn it tends &s;till farther to fo&s;ter and
encourage that Depravity. This Principle is, that
all <HI>Benevolence</HI> is mere Hypocri&s;y, Friend&s;hip a Cheat,
Public Spirit a Farce, Fidelity a Snare to procure
Tru&s;t and Confidence; and while all of us, at the
Bottom, pur&s;ue only our private Intere&s;t, we wear
the&s;e fair Di&s;gui&s;es, in order to put others off their
Guard, and expo&s;e them the more to our Wiles and
Machinations. What Heart one mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
of, who profe&s;&s;es &s;uch Principles, and who feels no
internal Sentiment to belye &s;o pernicious a Theory,
'tis ea&s;y to imagine: And al&s;o, what Degree of Af|fection
and Benevolence he can bear to a Species,
<PB N="12" REF="15">
whom he repre&s;ents under &s;uch odious Colours, and
&s;uppo&s;es &s;o little &s;u&s;ceptible of Gratitude or any Re|turn
of Affection. Or if we will not a&s;cribe the&s;e
Principles altogether to a corrupted Heart, we mu&s;t,
at lea&s;t, account for them from the mo&s;t carele&s;s and
precipitate Examination. Superficial Rea&s;oners,
indeed, ob&s;erving many fal&s;e Pretences among&s;t
Mankind, and feeling, perhaps, no very &s;trong Re|&s;traint
in their own Di&s;po&s;ition, might draw a general
and a ha&s;ty Conclu&s;ion, that all is equally corrupted,
and that Men, different from all other Animals, and
indeed from all other Species of Exi&s;tence, admit of
no Degrees of Good or Bad, but are, in every In|&s;tance,
the &s;ame Creatures, under different Di&s;gui&s;es
and Appearances.</P>
<P>THERE is another Principle, &s;omewhat re&s;embling,
the former; which has been much in&s;i&s;ted on by
Philo&s;ophers, and has been the Foundation of many
a fair Sy&s;tem; that whatever Affection one may feel,
or imagine he feels for others, no Pa&s;&s;ion is, or can
be di&s;intere&s;ted; that the mo&s;t generous Friend&s;hip,
however &s;incere, is a Modification of Self-love; and,
that even unknown to Our&s;elves, we &s;eek only our
Gratification, while we appear the mo&s;t deeply en|gag'd
in Schemes for the Liberty and Happine&s;s of
Mankind. By a Turn of Imagination, by a Refine|ment
of Reflection, by an Enthu&s;ia&s;in of Pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="13" REF="16">
we &s;eem to take Part in the Intere&s;ts of others, and
imagine Our&s;elves dive&s;ted of all &s;elfi&s;h Views and
Con&s;iderations: But at the Bottom, the mo&s;t generous
Patriot and mo&s;t niggardly Mi&s;er, the brave&s;t Hero
and mo&s;t abject Coward, have, in every Action, an
equal Regard to their own Happine&s;s and Welfare.</P>
<P>WHOEVER concludes, from the &s;eeming Tendency
of this Opinion, that tho&s;e, who make Profe&s;&s;ion of
it, cannot po&s;&s;ibly feel the true Sentiments of Bene|volence,
or have any Regard for genuine Virtue, will
often find him&s;elf, in Practice, very much mi&s;taken.
Probity and Honour were no Strangers to <HI>Epicurus</HI>
and his Sect. <HI>Atticus</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> &s;eem to have en|joy'd
from Nature, and cultivated by Reflection, as
generous and friendly Di&s;po&s;itions as any Di&s;ciple of
the au&s;terer Schools. And among&s;t the Moderns,
<HI>Hobbes</HI> and <HI>Locke,</HI> who maintain'd the &s;elfi&s;h Sy&s;tem
of Morals, liv'd mo&s;t irreproachable Lives; tho' the
former lay not under any Re&s;traints of Religion,
which might &s;upply the Defects of his Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>AN <HI>Epicurean</HI> or a <HI>Hobbi&s;t</HI> readily allows, that there
is &s;uch a Thing as Friend&s;hip in the World, without
Hypocri&s;y or Di&s;gui&s;e; tho' he may attempt, by a
philo&s;ophical Chymi&s;try, to re&s;olve the Elements of
this Pa&s;&s;ion, if I may &s;o &s;peak, into tho&s;e of another,
and explain every Affection to be Self-love, twi&s;ted
<PB N="14" REF="17">
and moulded into a Variety of Shapes and Appear|ances.
But as the &s;ame Turn of Imagination pre|vails
not in every Man, nor gives the &s;ame Direction
to the original Pa&s;&s;ion; this is &s;ufficient, even ac|cording
to the &s;elfi&s;h Sy&s;tem, to make the wide&s;t Dif|ference
in human Characters, and denominate one
Man virtuous and humane, another vicious and
meanly intere&s;ted. I e&s;teem the Man, who&s;e Self|love,
by whatever Means, is &s;o directed as to give
him a Concern for others, and render him &s;erviceable
to Society: As I hate or de&s;pi&s;e him, who has no
Regard to any Thing beyond his own pitiful Gratifi|cations
and Enjoyments. In vain would you &s;ugge&s;t,
that the&s;e Characters, tho' &s;eemingly oppo&s;ite, are,
at the Bottom, the &s;ame, and that a very incon&s;ider|able
Turn of Imagination forms the whole Difference
betwixt them. Each Character, notwith&s;tanding
the&s;e incon&s;iderable Differences, appears to me, in
Practice, pretty durable and untran&s;mutable. And
I find not, in this, more than in other Subjects, that
the natural Sentiments, ari&s;ing from the general Ap|pearances
of Things, are ea&s;ily de&s;troy'd by re&s;in'd
Reflections concerning the minute Origin of the&s;e
Appearances. Does not the lively, cheerful Colour
of a Countenance in&s;pire me with Complacency and
Plea&s;ure; even tho' I learn from Philo&s;ophy, that all
Difference of Complexion ari&s;es from the mo&s;t mi|nute
<PB N="15" REF="18">
Differences of Thickne&s;s, in the mo&s;t minute
Parts of the Skin; by which Differences one Super|ficies
is qualify'd to reflect one of the original Colours
of Light, and ab&s;orb the others?</P>
<P>BUT tho' the Que&s;tion, concerning the univer&s;al

is u&s;ually imagin'd, to Morality and Practice, it is
certainly of great Con&s;equence in the &s;peculative
Science of human Nature, and is a proper Object of
Curio&s;ity and Enquiry. It may not, therefore, be
improper, in this Place, to be&s;tow a few Reflections
upon it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Benevolence naturally divides into two Kinds, the <HI>general</HI> and <HI>particular.</HI> The fir&s;t is, where we have no Friend&s;hip or Con|nexion or E&s;teem for the Per&s;on, but feel only a general Sympathy with him or a Compa&s;&s;ion for his Pains, and a Congratulation with his Plea&s;ures. The other Species of Benevolence is founded on an Opinion of Virtue, on Services done us, or on &s;ome particular Cornexions. Both the&s;e Sentiments mu&s;t be allow'd real in human Nature; but whether they will re&s;olve into &s;ome nice Con&s;iderations of Self-love, is a Que&s;tion more curious than important. The for|mer Sentiment, <HI>viz.</HI> that of general Benevolence or Humanity or Sympathy, we &s;hall have Occa&s;ion frequently to treat of in the Cour&s;e of the&s;e E&s;&s;ays; and I a&s;&s;ume it as real, from general Ex|perience, without any other Proof.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t obvious Objection to the &s;elfi&s;h Hypo|the&s;is,
is, that being contrary to common Feeling and
our mo&s;t unprejudic'd Notions and Opinions; there
<PB N="16" REF="19">
is requir'd the highe&s;t Stretch of Philo&s;ophy to e&s;ta|bli&s;h
&s;o extraordinary a Paradox. To the mo&s;t care|le&s;s
Ob&s;erver, there appear to be &s;uch Di&s;po&s;itions as
Benevolence and Genero&s;ity; &s;uch Affections as
Love, Friend&s;hip, Compa&s;&s;ion, Gratitude. The&s;e
Sentiments have their Cau&s;es, Effects, Objects, and
Operations, markt by common Language and Ob&s;er|vation,
and plainly di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the &s;elfi&s;h Pa&s;|&s;ions.
And as this is the obvious Appearance of
Things, it mu&s;t be admitted; till &s;ome Hypothe&s;is be
di&s;cover'd, which, by penetrating deeper into human
Nature, may prove the former Affections to be No|thing
but Modifications of the latter. All Attempts
of this Kind have hitherto prov'd fruitle&s;s, and &s;eem
to have proceeded entirely from that Love of <HI>Simpli|city,</HI>
which has been the Source of much fal&s;e Rea|&s;oning
in Philo&s;ophy. I &s;hall not here enter into any
Detail on the pre&s;ent Subject. Many able Philo&s;o|phers
have &s;hown the In&s;ufficiency of the&s;e Sy&s;tems.
And I &s;hall take for granted what, I believe, the
&s;malle&s;t Reflection will make evident to every impar|tial
Enquirer.</P>
<P>BUT the Nature of the Subject furni&s;hes the &s;trong|e&s;t
Pre&s;umption, that no better Sy&s;tem will ever, for
the future, be invented, to account for the Origin of
the benevolent from the &s;elfi&s;h Affections, and reduce
all the various Emotions of the human Mind to a per|fect
<PB N="17" REF="20">
Simplicity and Uniformity. The Ca&s;e is not the
&s;ame in this Species of Philo&s;ophy as in Phy&s;ics.
Many an Hypothe&s;is in Nature, contrary to fir&s;t Ap|pearances,
has been found, on more accurate Scru|tiny,
&s;olid and &s;atisfactory. In&s;tances of this Kind
are &s;o frequent, that a judicious, as well as witty Phi|lo&s;opher
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;r. <HI>Fontenelle.</HI></NOTE> has ventur'd to affirm, if there be more
than one Way, in which any Phaenomenon may be
produc'd, that there is a general Pre&s;umption for its
ari&s;ing from the Cau&s;es, which are the lea&s;t obvious
and familiar. But the Pre&s;umption always lies on the
other Side, in all Enquiries concerning the Origin of
our Pa&s;&s;ions, and the internal Operations of the hu|man
Mind. The &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t obvious Cau&s;e,
that can there be a&s;&s;ign'd for any Phaenomenon, is
probably the true one. When a Philo&s;opher, in the
Explication of his Sy&s;tem, is oblig'd to have Recour&s;e
to &s;ome very intricate and refin'd Reflections, and to
&s;uppo&s;e them e&s;&s;ential to the Production of any Pa&s;|&s;ion
or Emotion, we have Rea&s;on to be extremely on
our Guard again&s;t &s;o fallacious an Hypothe&s;is. The
Affections are not &s;u&s;ceptible of any Impre&s;&s;ion from
the Refinements of Rea&s;on or Imagination; and 'tis
always found, that a vigorous Exertion of the latter
Faculties, from the narrow Capacity of the human
Mind, de&s;troys all Energy and Activity in the former.
<PB N="18" REF="21">
Our predominant Motive or Intention is, indeed,
frequently conceal'd from Our&s;elves, when it is
mingled and confounded with others, which the
Mind, from Vanity or Self-conceit, is de&s;irous of
&s;uppo&s;ing of greater Force and Influence: But there
is no In&s;tance, that a Concealment of this Nature
has ever ari&s;en from the Ab&s;tru&s;ene&s;s and Intricacy
of the Motive. A Man, who has lo&s;t a Friend and
Patron, may flatter him&s;elf, that all his Grief ari&s;es
from generous Sentiments, without any Mixture of
narrow or intere&s;ted Con&s;iderations: But a Man, who
grieves for a valuable Friend, that needed his Patron|age
and Protection; how can we &s;uppo&s;e, that his
pa&s;&s;ionate Tenderne&s;s ari&s;es from &s;ome metaphy&s;ical
Regards to a Self-intere&s;t, which has no Foundation
or Reality? We may as well imagine, that minute
Wheels and Springs, like tho&s;e of a Watch, give
Motion to a loaded Waggon, as account for the
Origin of Pa&s;&s;ion from &s;uch ab&s;tru&s;e Reflections.</P>
<P>ANIMALS are found &s;u&s;ceptible of Kindne&s;s, both
to their own Species and to ours; nor is there, in
this Ca&s;e, the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of Di&s;gui&s;e or Artifice.
Shall we account for all <HI>their</HI> Sentiments too, from
refin'd Deductions of Self-intere&s;t? Or if we ad|mit
a di&s;intere&s;ted Benevolence in the inferior Species,
by what Rule of Analogy can we refu&s;e it in the Su|perior?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="22">
LOVE betwixt the Sexes begets a Complacency
and Good-will, very di&s;tinct from the Gratification
of an Appetite. Tenderne&s;s to their Offspring, in
all &s;en&s;ible Beings, is commonly able alone to
counterballance the &s;tronge&s;t Motives of Self-love,
and has no Manner of Dependance on that Affection.
What Intere&s;t can a fond Mother have in View, who
lo&s;es her Health by a&s;&s;iduous Attendance on her &s;ick
Child, and afterwards langui&s;hes, and dies for Grief,
when freed, by its Death, from the Slavery of that
Attendance?</P>
<P>Is Gratitude no Affection of the human Brea&s;t, or is
that a Word merely, without any Meaning or Reality?
Have we no Complacency or Satisfaction in one
Man's Company above another's, and no De&s;ire of
the Welfare of our Friend, even tho' Ab&s;ence or
Death &s;hould prevent us from all Participation in it?
Or what is it commonly, that gives us any Partici|pation
in it, even while alive and pre&s;ent, but our
Affection and Regard to him?</P>
<P>THESE and a thou&s;and other In&s;tances are Marks
of a generous Benevolence in human Nature, where
no <HI>real</HI> Intere&s;t binds us to the Object. And how an
<HI>imaginary</HI> Intere&s;t, known and avow'd for &s;uch, can
be the Origin of any Pa&s;&s;ion or Emotion, &s;eems dif|ficult
<PB N="20" REF="23">
to explain. No &s;atisfactory Hypothe&s;is of this
Kind has yet been di&s;cover'd; nor is there the &s;malle&s;t
Probability, that the future Indu&s;try of Men will ever
be attended with more favourable Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT farther, if we con&s;ider rightly of the Matter,
we &s;hall find, that the Hypothe&s;is, which allows of a
di&s;intere&s;ted Benevolence, di&s;tinct from Self-love, has
really more <HI>Simplicity</HI> in it, and is more conformable
to the Analogy of Nature, than that which pretends
to re&s;olve all Friend&s;hip and Humanity into this latter
Principle. There are bodily Wants or Appetites,
acknowledged by every one, which nece&s;&s;arily pre|cede
all &s;en&s;ual Enjoyment, and carry us directly to
&s;eek Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Object. Thus, Hunger and
Thir&s;t have eating and drinking for their End; and
from the Gratification of the&s;e primary Appetites
ari&s;es a Plea&s;ure, which may become the Object of
another Species of De&s;ire or Inclination, that is &s;e|condary
and intere&s;ted. In the &s;ame Manner, there
are mental Pa&s;&s;ions, by which we are impell'd
immediately to &s;eek particular Objects, &s;uch as
Fame or Power or Vengeance, without any Regard
to Intere&s;t; and when the&s;e Objects are attain'd, a
plea&s;ing Enjoyment en&s;ues, as the Con&s;equence of our
indulg'd Affections. Nature mu&s;t, by the internal
Frame and Con&s;titution of the Mind, give an origi|nal
Propen&s;ity to Fame, 'ere we can reap any Plea&s;ure
<PB N="21" REF="24">
from it, or pur&s;ue it from Motives of Self-love, and
a De&s;ire of Happine&s;s. If I have no Vanity, I take
no Delight in Prai&s;e: If I be void of Ambition,
Power gives no Enjoyment: If I be not angry, the
Puni&s;hment of an Adver&s;ary is totally indifferent to
me. In all the&s;e Ca&s;es, there is a Pa&s;&s;ion, which
points immediately to the Object, and con&s;titutes it
our Good or Happine&s;s; as there are other &s;econ|dary
Pa&s;&s;ions, which afterwards ari&s;e, and pur&s;ue it
as a Part of our Happine&s;s, when once it is con&s;ti|tuted
&s;uch, by our original Affections. Were there
no Appetites of any Kind, antecedent to Self-love,
that Propen&s;ity could &s;carce ever exert it&s;elf; becau&s;e
we &s;hould, in that Ca&s;e, have felt few and &s;lender
Pains or Plea&s;ures, and have little Mi&s;ery or Happi|ne&s;s,
to avoid or to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>Now where is the Difficulty of conceiving, that
this may likewi&s;e be the Ca&s;e with Benevolence and
Friend&s;hip, and that, from the original Frame of our
Temper, we may feel a De&s;ire of another's Happi|ne&s;s
or Good, which, by Means of that Affection,
becomes our own Good, and is afterwards pur&s;ued,
from the conjoin'd Motives of Benevolence and Self-enjoyment?
Who &s;ees not that Vengeance, from
the Force alone of Pa&s;&s;ion, may be &s;o eagerly pur|&s;ued,
as to make us knowingly neglect every Con&s;i|deration
of Ea&s;e, Intere&s;t, or Safety; and, like

Humanity and Friend&s;hip, the &s;ame Privileges, which

more like a Satyr, than a true Delineation or De|&s;cription,

<P>IT may be e&s;teem'd, perhaps, a &s;uperfluous Task
to prove, that the benevolent or &s;ofter Affections
are VIRTUOUS; and wherever they appear,

Mankind. The Epithets <HI>&s;ociable, good-natur'd, hu|mane,

<P>WHEN <HI>Pericles,</HI> the great <HI>Athenian</HI> State&s;man and

enumerating his great Qualities and Succe&s;&s;es, his
Conque&s;ts and Victories, the unu&s;ual Length of his

IN Men of more ordinary Talents and Capacity,

pre&s;erve the Per&s;on from our &s;evere&s;t Hatred, as well

<P>IN the pre&s;ent Di&s;po&s;ition of the human Heart,
'twould, perhaps, be difficult to find compleat In|&s;tances

till all Di&s;tinction of Property be, in a great
Mea&s;ure, lo&s;t and confounded among&s;t them. Be|twixt

aboli&s;h all Divi&s;ion of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and has often,

ob&s;ervable, that, during the Ardour of new En|thu&s;ia&s;ms,

Extravagance, the Community of Goods has fre|quently
been attempted; and nothing but Experience

<PB N="38" REF="40">
its Exi&s;tence altogether from its nece&s;&s;ary <HI>U&s;e</HI> to
the Intercour&s;e and Society of Mankind.</P>
<P>To make this Truth more evident, let us rever&s;e
the foregoing Suppo&s;itions; and carrying every
Thing to the oppo&s;ite Extreme, con&s;ider what would
be the Effect of the&s;e new Situations. Suppo&s;e a
Society to fall into &s;uch Want of all common Ne|ce&s;&s;aries,
that the utmo&s;t Frugality and Indu&s;try can|not
pre&s;erve the greate&s;t Number from peri&s;hing,
and the whole from extreme Sufferance: It will
readily, I believe, be admitted, that the &s;trict Laws
of Ju&s;tice are &s;u&s;pended, in &s;uch a pre&s;&s;ing Emer|gence,
and give Place to the &s;tronger Motives of
Nece&s;&s;ity and Self-pre&s;ervation. Is it any Crime,
after a Shipwreck, to &s;eize whatever Means or In|&s;trument
of Safety one can lay hold of, without Re|gard
to former Limitations of Property? Or if a
City be&s;ieg'd were &s;tarving with Hunger; can we
imagine, that Men will &s;ee any Means of Life be|fore
them, and peri&s;h, from a &s;crupulous Regard to
what, in other Situations, would be the Rules of
Equity and Ju&s;tice? The USE and TENDENCY
of that Virtue is to procure Happine&s;s and Security,
by pre&s;erving Order in Society: But where the So|ciety
is ready to peri&s;h from extreme Nece&s;&s;ity, no
greater Evil can be dreaded from Violence and In|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;tice;

of Magi&s;tracy may, con&s;i&s;tent with Equity, extend
&s;o far: But were any Number of Men to a&s;&s;emble,
without the Tye of Laws or civil Juri&s;diction;
would an equal Partition of Bread in a Famine,
even without the Proprietor's Con&s;ent, be regarded
as criminal or injurious?</P>
<P>SUPPOSE al&s;o, that it &s;hould be a virtuous Man's
Fate to fall into the Society of Ruffians, remote
from the Protection of Laws and Government;
what Conduct mu&s;t he embrace in that melancholy

Conclu&s;ion, and mu&s;t terminate in De&s;truction to
the greater Number, and in a total Di&s;&s;olution of

other Expedient, than to arm him&s;elf, to whom|ever
the Sword he &s;eizes, or the Buckler may be|long:
Make Provi&s;ion of all Means of Defence and

no longer of USE to his own Safety or that of

without Concern for tho&s;e, who no

<P>WHEN any Man, even in political Society, renders

is puni&s;h'd by the Laws in his Goods and Per&s;on;
that is, the ordinary Rules of Ju&s;tice are, with Re|gard
to him, &s;u&s;pended for a Moment, and it be|comes

Wrong or Injury.</P>
<P>THE Rage and Violence of public War; what

the former mu&s;t al&s;o &s;u&s;pend their Ob&s;ervance of
them, where they no longer &s;erve to any Purpo&s;e;

bloody and pernicious as po&s;&s;ible to the fir&s;t Ag|gre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="43">
THUS the Rules of Equity or Ju&s;tice depend en|tirely
on the particular State and Condition, in

the Public from their &s;trict and regular Ob&s;ervance.
Rever&s;e, in any con&s;iderable Circum&s;tance, the Con|dition

extreme Nece&s;&s;ity: Implant in the human Brea&s;t
perfect Moderation and Humanity, or perfect Rapa|ciou&s;ne&s;s

<HI>u&s;ele&s;s,</HI> you thereby totally de&s;troy its E&s;&s;ence, and
&s;u&s;pend its Obligation upon Mankind.</P>
<P>THE common Situation of Society is a Medium
amid&s;t all the&s;e Extremes. We are naturally par|tial
to Our&s;elves, and to our Friends; but are ca|pable
of learning the Advantage, re&s;ulting from a
more equal Conduct. Few Enjoyments are given
us from the open and liberal Hand of Nature; but
by Art, Labour, and Indu&s;try, we can extract them
in great Abundance. Hence the Ideas of Pro|perty
become nece&s;&s;ary in all civil Society: Hence
Ju&s;tice derives its U&s;efulne&s;s to the Public: And
hence alone ari&s;es its Merit and moral Obligation.</P>
<P>THESE Conclu&s;ions are &s;o natural and obvious,

De&s;criptions of the Felicity, attending the Golden

the Effects of their Re&s;entment; the nece&s;&s;ary Con|&s;equence,
I think, is, that we &s;hould be bound, by
the Laws of Humanity, to give gentle U&s;age to
the&s;e Creatures, but &s;hould not, properly &s;peaking,
lie under any Re&s;traint of Ju&s;tice with Regard to

Whatever we covet, they mu&s;t in&s;tantly re&s;ign: Our

the Re&s;traints of Ju&s;tice and Property, being totally

<P>THIS is plainly the Situation of Men with regard

when united, have, in all Countries, brute Force
&s;ufficient to maintain this &s;evere Tyranny; yet &s;uch
are the In&s;inuation, Addre&s;s, and Charms of their

incapable of Ju&s;tice, as of &s;ocial Di&s;cour&s;e and
Conver&s;ation. Where mutual Regards and For|bearance
&s;erve no Manner of Purpo&s;e, they would
never direct the Conduct of any rea&s;onable Man.
The headlong Cour&s;e of the Pa&s;&s;ions would be

<P>IF we examine all the <HI>particular</HI> Laws, by which
Ju&s;tice is directed, and Property determin'd; we
&s;hall &s;till be pre&s;ented with the &s;ame Conclu&s;ion.
The Good of Mankind is the only Object of all
the&s;e Laws and Regulations. Not only 'tis requi&s;ite,
for the Peace and Intere&s;t of Society, that Men's
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;hould be &s;eparated; but the Rules,
which we follow in making the Separation, are &s;uch
as can be&s;t be contriv'd to &s;erve farther the Intere&s;ts
of Society.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, that a Creature, po&s;&s;e&s;t of
Rea&s;on, but unacquainted with human Nature, de|liberates
with him&s;elf what RULES of Ju&s;tice or
Property would be&s;t promote public Intere&s;t, and
e&s;tabli&s;h Peace and Security among&s;t Mankind:
His mo&s;t obvious Thought would be, to a&s;&s;ign the
large&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Virtue, and
give every one the Power of doing Good, propor|tion'd
to his Inclination. In a perfect Theocracy,
where a Being, infinitely intelligent, governs by par|ticular
Volitions, this Rule would certainly have
Place, and might &s;erve the wi&s;e&s;t Purpo&s;es: But
were Mankind to execute &s;uch a Law; (&s;o great is
the Uncertainty of Merit, both from its natural Ob|&s;curity,
<PB N="49" REF="51">
and from the Self-conceit of each Indivi|dual)
that no determinate Rule of Conduct would
ever re&s;ult from it; and the total Di&s;&s;olution of So|ciety
mu&s;t be the immediate Con&s;equence. Fanatics
may &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>that Dominion is founded in Grace,</HI> and
<HI>that Saints alone inherit the Earth;</HI> but the civil
Magi&s;trate very ju&s;tly puts the&s;e &s;ublime Theori&s;ts
on the &s;ame Footing with common Robbers, and
teaches them, by the &s;evere&s;t Di&s;cipline, that a Rule,
which, in Speculation, may &s;eem the mo&s;t advanta|geous
to Society, may yet be found, in Practice, to|tally
pernicious and de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>THAT there were <HI>religious</HI> Fanatics of this kind in
<HI>England,</HI> during the civil Wars, we learn from
Hi&s;tory; tho' 'tis probable, that the obvious <HI>Ten|dency</HI>
of the&s;e Principles excited &s;uch Horrour in
Mankind, as &s;oon oblig'd the dangerous Enthu&s;ia&s;ts
to renounce, or at lea&s;t conceal their Tenets. Per|haps,
the <HI>Levellers,</HI> who claim'd an equal Di&s;tribu|tion
of Property, were a Kind of <HI>political</HI> Fanatics,
which aro&s;e from the religious Species, and more
openly avow'd their Preten&s;ions, as carrying a more
plau&s;ible Appearance, of being practicable, as well
as u&s;eful to human Society.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t, indeed, be confe&s;t, that Nature is &s;o
liberal to Mankind, that were all her Pre&s;ents equally
<PB N="50" REF="52">
divided among&s;t the Species, and improv'd by Art
and Indu&s;try, every Individual would enjoy all the
Nece&s;&s;aries, and even mo&s;t of the Comforts of Life;
nor would ever be liable to any Ills, but &s;uch as
might accidentally ari&s;e from the &s;ickly Frame and
Con&s;titution of his Body. It mu&s;t al&s;o be confe&s;t,
that, wherever we depart from this Equality, we
rob the Poor of more Satisfaction than we add to
the Rich, and that the &s;light Gratification of a fri|volous
Vanity, in one Individual, frequently co&s;ts
more than Bread to many Families, and even Pro|vinces.
It may appear withal, that the Rule of
Equality, as it would be highly <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> is not altoge|ther
<HI>impracticable;</HI> but has taken Place, at lea&s;t, in
an imperfect Degree, in &s;ome Republics; particu|larly,
that of <HI>Sparta;</HI> where it was attended, as 'tis
&s;aid, with the mo&s;t beneficial Con&s;equences. Not
to mention, that the <HI>Agrarian</HI> Laws, &s;o frequently
claim'd in <HI>Rome,</HI> and carry'd to Execution in many
<HI>Greek</HI> Cities, proceeded, all of them, from a general
Idea of the Utility of this Principle.</P>
<P>But Hi&s;torians, and even common Sen&s;e, may in|form
us, that, however &s;pecious the&s;e Ideas of <HI>per|fect</HI>
Equality may &s;eem, they are really, at the Bot|tom,
<HI>impracticable;</HI> and were they not &s;o, would be
extremely <HI>pernicious</HI> to human Society. Render the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Men ever &s;o equal, their different De|grees
<PB N="51" REF="53">
of Art, Care, and Indu&s;try will immediately
break that Equality. Or if you check the&s;e Virtues,
you reduce Society to the extreme&s;t Indigence; and
in&s;tead of preventing Want and Beggary in a few,
render it unavoidable to the whole Community.
The mo&s;t rigorous Inqui&s;ition too, is requi&s;ite to
watch every Inequality on its fir&s;t Appearance; and
the mo&s;t &s;evere Juri&s;diction, to puni&s;h and redre&s;s it.
But be&s;ides, that &s;o much Authority mu&s;t &s;oon de|generate
into Tyranny, and be exerted with great
Partialities; who can po&s;&s;ibly be po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, in
&s;uch a Situation as is here &s;uppos'd? Perfect Equa|lity
of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, de&s;troying all Subordination,
weakens extremely the Authority of Magi&s;tracy, and
mu&s;t reduce all Power nearly to a Level, as well as
Property.</P>
<P>WE may conclude, therefore, that, in order to
e&s;tabli&s;h Laws for the Regulation of Property, we
mu&s;t be acquainted with the Nature and Situation
of Man, mu&s;t reject Appearances, which may be
fal&s;e, tho' &s;pecious, and mu&s;t &s;earch for tho&s;e Rules,
which are, on the whole, mo&s;t <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> and <HI>beneficial,</HI>
Vulgar Sen&s;e and &s;light Experience are &s;ufficient for
this Purpo&s;e; where Men give not way to too &s;elfi&s;h
Avidity, or too exten&s;ive Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54">
WHO &s;ees not, for In&s;tance, that whatever is pro|duc'd
or improv'd by a Man's Art or Indu&s;try ought,
for ever, to be &s;ecur'd to him, in order to give En|couragement
to &s;uch <HI>u&s;eful</HI> Habits and Accompli&s;h|ments?
That the Property ought al&s;o to de&s;cend to
Children and Relations, for the &s;ame <HI>u&s;eful</HI> Purpo&s;e?
That it may be alienated by Con&s;ent, in order to be|get

and Promi&s;es ought carefully to be fulfill'd, in order
to &s;ecure mutual Tru&s;t and Confidence, by which
the general <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> of Mankind is &s;o much pro|moted?</P>
<P>EXAMINE the Writers on the Laws of Nature;
and you will always find, that, whatever Principles
they &s;et out with, they are &s;ure to terminate here at
la&s;t, and to a&s;&s;ign, as the ultimate Rea&s;on for every
Rule they e&s;tabli&s;h, the Convenience and Nece&s;&s;ities
of Mankind. A Conce&s;&s;ion thus extorted, in Op|po&s;ition
to Sy&s;tems, has more Authority, than if it
had been made, in Pro&s;ecution of them.</P>
<P>WHAT other Rea&s;on, indeed, could Writers ever
give, why this mu&s;t be <HI>mine</HI> and that <HI>yours;</HI> &s;ince
unin&s;tructed Nature, &s;urely, never made any &s;uch
Di&s;tinction? The&s;e Objects are, of them&s;elves,
<PB N="53" REF="55">
foreign to us; they are totally disjoin'd and &s;eparate;
and nothing but the general Intere&s;ts of Society can
form the Connection.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES, the Intere&s;ts of Society may require
a Rule of Ju&s;tice in a particular Ca&s;e; but may no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
determine any particular Rule, among&s;t &s;everal,
which are all equally beneficial. In that Ca&s;e, the
&s;lighte&s;t <HI>Analogies</HI> are laid hold of, in order to pre|vent
that Indifference and Ambiguity, which would
be the Source of perpetual Quarrels and Di&s;&s;entions.
Thus Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion alone, and fir&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is &s;uppos'd
to convey Property, where no-body el&s;e has any
precedent Claim and Preten&s;ion. Many of the
Rea&s;onings of Lawyers are of this analogical Na|ture,
and depend on very &s;light Connexions of the
Imagination.</P>
<P>Is it ever &s;crupled, in extraordinary Ca&s;es, to vio|late
all Regard to the private Property of Individuals,
and &s;acrifice to public Intere&s;t a Di&s;tinction, which
had been e&s;tabli&s;h'd for the Sake of that Intere&s;t?
The Safety of the People is the &s;upreme Law: All
other particular Laws are &s;ubordinate to it, and de|pendant
on it: And if, in the <HI>common</HI> Cour&s;e of
Things, they be followed and regarded; 'tis only
becau&s;e the public Safety and Intere&s;t, <HI>commonly</HI> de|mand
&s;o equal and impartial an Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="56">
SOMETIMES both <HI>Utility</HI> and <HI>Analogy</HI> fail, and leave
the Laws of Ju&s;tice in total Uncertainty. Thus,
'tis highly requi&s;ite, that Pre&s;cription or long Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
&s;hould convey Property; but what Number
of Days or Months or Years &s;hould be &s;ufficient for
that Purpo&s;e, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for Rea&s;on alone to de|termine.
<HI>Civil Laws</HI> here &s;upply the Place of the
natural <HI>Code,</HI> and a&s;&s;ign different Terms for Pre&s;crip|tion,
according to the different <HI>Utilities,</HI> propos'd
by the Legi&s;lator. Bills of Exchange and promi&s;&s;ory
Notes, by the Laws of mo&s;t Countries, pre&s;cribe
&s;ooner than Bonds and Mortgages, and Contracts of
a more formal Nature.</P>
<P>IN general we may ob&s;erve, that all Que&s;tions of
Property are &s;ubordinate to the Authority of civil
Laws, which extend, re&s;train, modify, and alter
the Rules of natural Ju&s;tice, according to the par|ticular
<HI>Convenience</HI> of each Community. The Laws
have, or ought to have, a con&s;tant Reference to the
Con&s;titution of Government, the Manners, the Cli|mate,
the Religion, the Commerce, the Situation of
each Society. A late Author of great Genius, as
well as exten&s;ive Learning, has pro&s;ecuted this Sub|ject
at large, and has e&s;tabli&s;h'd, from the&s;e Prin|ciples,
the be&s;t Sy&s;tem of political Knowledge, that,
<PB N="55" REF="57">
perhaps, has ever yet been communicated to the
World<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Author of <HI>L'E&s;prit des Loix.</HI> This illu&s;trious Writer, however, &s;ets out with a different Theory, and &s;uppo&s;es all Right to be founded on certain <HI>Rapports</HI> or Relations; which is a Sy&s;tem, that, in my Opinion, never will reconcile with true Philo&s;ophy. Father <HI>Malebranche,</HI> as far as I can learn, was the fir&s;t, that &s;tarted this ab&s;tract Theory of Morals, which was afterwards adopted by Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI> and others; and as it excludes all Sentiment, and pre|tends to found every Thing on Rea&s;on, it has not wanted Followers in this philo&s;ophic Age. See <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> 1. and <HI>Appendix</HI> 1. With 1 gard to Ju&s;tice, the Virtue here treated of, the Inference again&s;t this Theory &s;eems &s;hort and conclu&s;ive. Property is allow'd to be de|pendant on civil Laws: Civil Laws are allow'd to have no Object but the Intere&s;t of Society: This therefore mu&s;t be allow'd to be the &s;ole Foundation of Property and Ju&s;tice. Not to mention, that our Obligation it&s;elf to obey the Magi&s;trate and his Laws is founded on nothing but the Intere&s;ts of Society.</P>
<P>If the Ideas of Ju&s;tice, &s;ometimes, do not follow the Di&s;po&s;iti|ons of civil Law; we &s;hall find, that the&s;e Ca&s;es, in&s;tead of Ob|jections, are Confirmations of the Theory deliver'd above. Where a civil Law is &s;o perver&s;e as to cro&s;s all the Intere&s;ts of Society, it lo&s;es all its Authority, and Men judge by the Ideas of natural Ju&s;tice, which are conformable to tho&s;e Intere&s;ts. Sometimes al&s;o civil Laws, for u&s;eful Purpo&s;es, require a Ceremony or Form; and where that is wanting, their Decrees run contrary to the u&s;ual Tenor of Ju&s;tice; but one, who takes Advantage of &s;uch Chicanes, is not regarded as an hone&s;t Man. Thus, the Intere&s;ts of Society require, that Contracts be fulfill'd; and there is not a more mate|rial Article either of natural or civil Ju&s;tice: But the Omi&s;&s;ion of a trifling Circum&s;tance will often, by Law, invalidate a Contract, <HI>in foro humano,</HI> but not <HI>in foro con&s;cientiae,</HI> as Divines expre&s;s them|&s;elves. In the&s;e Ca&s;es, the Magi&s;trate is &s;uppos'd only to with|draw his Power of enforcing the Right, not to have alter'd the Right. Where his Intention extends to the Right, and is con|formable to the Intere&s;ts of Society; it never fails to alter the Right; a clear Proof of the Origin of Ju&s;tice and of Property, as a&s;&s;ign'd above.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>HAD every Man &s;ufficient <HI>Sagacity</HI> to perceive,
at all Times, the &s;trong Intere&s;t, which binds
him to the Ob&s;ervance of Ju&s;tice and Equity, and
<HI>Strength of Mind</HI> &s;ufficient to per&s;evere in a &s;teady
Adherence to a general and a di&s;tant Intere&s;t, in Op|po&s;ition
to the Allurements of pre&s;ent Plea&s;ure and
Advantage: There had never, in that Ca&s;e, been
any &s;uch Thing as Government or political Society,
but each Man following his natural Liberty, had
liv'd in entire Peace and Harmony with all others.
What Need of po&s;itive Laws, where natural Ju&s;tice
is, of it&s;elf, a &s;ufficient Re&s;traint? Why create
Magi&s;trates, where there never ari&s;es any Di&s;order
or Iniquity? Why abridge our native Freedom,
when, in every In&s;tance, the utmo&s;t Exertion of it is
found innocent and beneficial? 'Tis evident, that, if
Government were totally u&s;ele&s;s, it never could have
Place, and that the SOLE Foundation of the
<PB N="4" REF="65">
Duty of ALLEGIANCE is the <HI>Advantage</HI>
which it procures to Society, by pre&s;erving Peace and
Order among&s;t Mankind.</P>
<P>WHEN a Number of political Societies are erected,
and maintain a great Entercour&s;e together; a new Set
of Rules are immediately di&s;cover'd to be <HI>u&s;eful</HI> in
that particular Situation; and accordingly take place,
under the Title of LAWS of NATIONS.
Of this Kind are, the Sacredne&s;s of the Per&s;ons of
Amba&s;&s;adors, ab&s;taining from poi&s;on'd Arms, Quar|ter
in War, with others of that Kind; which are
plainly calculated for the <HI>Advantage</HI> of States and
Kingdoms, in their Entercour&s;e with each other.</P>
<P>THE Rules of Ju&s;tice, &s;uch as prevail among&s;t
Individuals, are not altogether &s;u&s;pended among&s;t
political Societies. All Princes pretend a Regard to
the Rights of others; and &s;ome, no doubt, without
Hypocri&s;y. Alliances and Treaties are every Day
made betwixt independent States, which would only
be &s;o much Wa&s;te of Parchment, if they were not
found, by Experience, to have <HI>&s;ome</HI> Influence and
Authority. But here is the Difference betwixt King|doms
and Individuals. Human Nature cannot, by
any Means, &s;ub&s;i&s;t, without the A&s;&s;ociation of Indi|viduals;
and that A&s;&s;ociation never could have
Place, were no Regard pay'd to the Laws of Equity
<PB N="65" REF="66">
and Ju&s;tice. Di&s;order, Confu&s;ion, the War of All
again&s;t All are the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences of &s;uch a
licentious Conduct. But Nations can flouri&s;h with|out
Entercour&s;e. They may even &s;ub&s;i&s;t, in &s;ome
Degree, under a general War. The Ob&s;ervance of
Ju&s;tice, tho' u&s;eful among them, is not guarded by
&s;o &s;trong a Nece&s;&s;ity as among Individuals; and the
<HI>moral Obligation</HI> holds Proportion with the <HI>U&s;efulne&s;s.</HI>
All Politicians will allow, and mo&s;t Philo&s;ophers,
that REASONS of STATE may, in parti|cular
Emergencies, di&s;pence with the Rules of Ju&s;tice,
and invalidate any Treaty or Alliance, where the
&s;trict Ob&s;ervance of it would be prejudicial, in a
con&s;iderable Degree, to either of the contracting
Parties. But nothing le&s;s than the extreme&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity,
'tis confe&s;t, can ju&s;tify Individuals in a Breach of
Promi&s;e, or an Inva&s;ion of the Properties of others.</P>
<P>IN a confederated Commonwealth, &s;uch as the
<HI>Achaean</HI> Republic of old, or the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Cantons and
United Provinces in modern Times; as the League
has here a peculiar <HI>Utility,</HI> the Conditions of Union
have a peculiar Sacredne&s;s and Authority, and a
Violation of them would be equally criminal, or
even more criminal, than any private Injury or In|ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>AN Infidelity of this Nature is much more <HI>per|nicious</HI>

The Imagination is influenced by A&s;&s;ociations of Ideas; which, tho' they ari&s;e, at fir&s;t, from the Judgment, are not ea&s;ily alter'd by every particular Exception, that occurs to us. To which we may add, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e of Cha&s;tity, that the Example of the Old would be pernicious to the Young; and that Women continually thinking, that a certain Time would bring them the Liberty of Indulgence, would naturally advance that Period, and think more lightly of this whole Duty, &s;o requi&s;ite to Society.</NOTE>.</P>

THOSE who live in the &s;ame Family have &s;o many
Opportunities of Licences of this Kind, that nothing
could pre&s;erve Purity of Manners, were Marriage
allow'd among&s;t the neare&s;t Relations, or any Inter|cour&s;e
of Love betwixt them ratify'd by Law and
Cu&s;tom. INCEST, therefore, being <HI>pernicious</HI>
in a &s;uperior Degree, has al&s;o a &s;uperior Turpitude
and moral Deformity, annex'd to it.</P>
<P>WHAT is the Rea&s;on, why, by the <HI>Greek</HI> Laws,
one might marry a Half-&s;i&s;ter by the Father, but not
by the Mother? Plainly this. The Manners of the
<HI>Greeks</HI> were &s;o re&s;erv'd, that a Man was never per|mitted
<PB N="68" REF="71">
to approach the Women's Apartment, even in
the &s;ame Family, unle&s;s where he vi&s;ited his own
Mother. His Step-mother and her Children were as
much &s;hut up from him as the Women of any other
Family, and there was as little Danger of any crimi|nal
Intercour&s;e betwixt them: Uncles and Nieces,
for a like Rea&s;on, might marry at <HI>Athens;</HI> but neither
the&s;e nor Half-brothers and Si&s;ters could contract that
Alliance at <HI>Rome,</HI> where the Intercour&s;e was more

of all the&s;e Variations.</P>
<P>To repeat, to a Man's Prejudice, any Thing that
e&s;cap'd him in private Conver&s;ation, or to make any
&s;uch U&s;e of his private Letters, is highly blam'd.
The free and &s;ocial Intercour&s;e of Minds mu&s;t be ex|tremely
checkt, where no &s;uch Rules of Fidelity are
e&s;tabli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>EVEN in repeating Stories, whence we can &s;ee no
ill Con&s;equences to re&s;ult, the giving one's Authors is
regarded as a Piece of Indi&s;cretion, if not of Immo|rality.
The&s;e Stories, in pa&s;&s;ing from Hand to Hand,
and receiving all the u&s;ual Variations, frequently
come about to the Per&s;ons concern'd, and produce
Animo&s;ities and Quarrels among People, who&s;e
Intentions are the mo&s;t innocent and inoffen&s;ive.</P>

To pry into Secrets, to open or even read the

<P>THIS Principle is al&s;o the Foundation of mo&s;t of
the Laws of Good-manners; a Kind of le&s;&s;er Mora|lity
calculated for the Ea&s;e of Company and Con|ver&s;ation.
Too much or too little Ceremony are
both blam'd, and every Thing, that promotes Ea&s;e,

<P>CONSTANCY in Friend&s;hips, Attachments, and Fa|miliarities
is commonly very laudable, and is requi&s;ite
to &s;upport Tru&s;t and good Corre&s;pondence in Society.
But in Places of general, tho' ca&s;ual Concour&s;e,
where Health and Plea&s;ure bring People promi&s;|cuou&s;ly
together, public Conveniency has di&s;pens'd
with this Maxim; and Cu&s;tom there promotes an
unre&s;erv'd Conver&s;ation for the Time, by indulging
the Privilege of dropping afterwards every indifferent
Acquaintance, without Breach of Civility or Good|manners.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="73">
EVEN in Societies, that are e&s;tabli&s;h'd on Principles
the mo&s;t immoral, and the mo&s;t de&s;tructive to the
Intere&s;ts of the general Society, there are requir'd
certain Rules and Maxims, which a Species of fal&s;e
Honour, as well as private Intere&s;t, engages the
Members to ob&s;erve. Robbers and Pyrates, it has
often been remark'd, could not maintain their per|nicious
Confederacy, did they not e&s;tabli&s;h a new
di&s;tributive Ju&s;tice among&s;t them&s;elves, and recall
tho&s;e Laws of Equity, which they have violated
with the re&s;t of Mankind.</P>
<P>I HATE a drinking Companion, &s;ays the <HI>Greek</HI> Pro|verb,
who never forgets. The Follies of the la&s;t
Debauch &s;hould be buried in eternal Oblivion, in
order to give full Scope to the Follies of the next.</P>
<P>AMONGST Nations, where an immoral Gallantry,
if cover'd with a thin Veil of My&s;tery, is, in &s;ome
Degree, authoriz'd by Cu&s;tom, there immediately
ari&s;e a Set of Rules, calculated for the Conveniency
of that Attachment. The famous Court or Parlia|ment
of Love in <HI>Provence</HI> decided formally all dif|ficult
Ca&s;es of this Nature.</P>
<P>IN Societies for Play, there are Laws requir'd for
the Conduct of the Game, and the&s;e Laws are dif|ferent
<PB N="71" REF="74">
in each Game. The Foundation, I own, of
&s;uch Societies is frivolous; and the Laws are, in a
great Mea&s;ure, tho' not altogether, capricious and
arbitrary. So far is there a material Difference be|twixt
them and the Rules of Ju&s;tice, Fidelity and
Loyalty. The general Societies of Men are ab&s;o|lutely
requi&s;ite for the Sub&s;i&s;tence of the Species;
and the public Conveniency, which regulates Morals,
is inviolably e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Nature of Man, and of
the World, in which he lives. The Compari&s;on,
therefore, in the&s;e Re&s;pects, is very imperfect. We
may only learn from it the Nece&s;&s;ity of Rules, where|ever
Men have any Intercour&s;e with each other.</P>
<P>THEY cannot even pa&s;s each other on the Road
without Rules. Waggoners, Coachmen, and Po&s;ti|lions
have Principles, by which they give way; and
the&s;e are chiefly founded on mutual Ea&s;e and Con|venience.
Sometimes al&s;o they are arbitrary, or at
be&s;t dependant on a Kind of capricious Analogy,
like many of the Rea&s;onings of Lawyers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the lighter Machine yields to the heavier, and in Ma|chines of the &s;ame Kind, that the empty yield to the loaded; this Rule is founded on Convenience. That tho&s;e who are going to the Capital take place of tho&s;e who are coming from it; this &s;eems to be &s;ounded on &s;ome Idea of the Dignity of the great City, and of the Preference of the future to the pa&s;t.

<P><PB N="72" REF="75">
To carry the Matter farther, we may ob&s;erve, that
'tis impo&s;&s;ible for Men &s;o much as to murther each
other without Statutes and Maxims, and an Idea of
Ju&s;tice and Honour. War has it Laws as well
as Peace; and even that &s;portive Kind of War carried
on among&s;t Wre&s;tlers, Boxers, Cudgel-players,
Gladiators, is &s;upported by fixt Principles and Regu|lations.

<P>IT &s;eems &s;o natural a Thought to a&s;cribe to their
Utility the Prai&s;e which we be&s;tow on the &s;ocial
Virtues, that one would expect to meet with this
Principle every-where in moral Writers, as the chief
Foundation of their Rea&s;oning and Inquiry. In
common Life, we may ob&s;erve, that the Circum&s;tance
of Utility is always appeal'd to; nor is it &s;uppos'd,
that a greater Elogy can be given to any Man, than
to di&s;play his U&s;efulne&s;s to the Public, and enumerate
the Services he has perform'd to Mankind and Society.
What Prai&s;e, even of an inanimate Form, if the
Regularity and Elegance of its Parts de&s;troy not its
Fitne&s;s for any u&s;eful Purpo&s;e! And how &s;atis|factory
an Apology for any Di&s;proportion of &s;eeming
Deformity, if we can &s;how the Nece&s;&s;ity of that
<PB N="74" REF="77">
particular Con&s;truction for the U&s;e intended! A
Ship appears infinitely more beautiful to an Arti&s;t,
or one moderately &s;kill'd in Navigation; where its
Prow is wide and &s;welling beyond its Poop, than if it
were fram'd with a preci&s;e geometrical Regularity,
in Contradiction to all the Laws of Mechanics. A
Building, who&s;e Doors and Windows were exact
Squares, would hurt the Eye by that very Proportion;
as ill adapted to the human Figure, for who&s;e Service
the Fabric was intended What Wonder then, that
a Man, who&s;e Habits and Conduct are hurtful to
Society, and dangerous or pernicious to every one,
that has an Intercour&s;e with him, &s;hould, on that
Account, be an Object of Di&s;approbation, and com|municate
to every Spectator the &s;tronge&s;t Sentiments
of Di&s;gu&s;t and Hatred<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We ought not to imagine, becau&s;e an inanimate Object may be u&s;eful as well as a Man, that therefore it ought al&s;o, according to this Sy&s;tem, to merit the Appellation of <HI>virtuous.</HI> The Sentiments, excited by Utility, are, in the two Ca&s;es, very different; and the one is mixt with Affection, E&s;teem, Appro|bation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and not the other. In like Manner, an inanimate Object may have good Colour and Proportions as well as a human Figure. But can we ever be in Love with the former? There are a numerous Set of Pa&s;&s;ions and Sentiments, of which think|ing rational Beings are, by the original Con&s;titution of Nature, the only proper Objects: And tho' the very &s;ame Qualities be transferr'd to an in&s;en&s;ible, inanimate Being, they will not excite the &s;ame Sentiments. The beneficial Qualities of Herbs and Mi|nerals are, indeed, &s;ometimes call'd their <HI>Virtues;</HI> but this is an Effect of the Caprice of Language, which ought not to be regarded in Rea&s;oning. For tho' there be a Species of Approba|tion, attending even inanimate Objects, when beneficial, yet this Sentiment is &s;o weak, and &s;o different from what is directed to beneficent Magi&s;trates or State&s;men, that they ought not to be rank'd under the &s;ame Cla&s;s or Appellation.</P>
<P>A very &s;mall Variation of the Object, even where the &s;ame Qualities are pre&s;erv'd, will de&s;troy a Sentiment. Thus; the &s;ame Beauty, transferr'd to a different Sex, excites no amorous Pa&s;&s;ion, where Nature is not extremely perverted.</P></NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="78">
BUT perhaps the Difficulty of accounting for the&s;e
Effects of U&s;efulne&s;s, or its contrary, has kept Philo|&s;ophers
from admitting them into their Sy&s;tems of
Ethics, and has induc'd them rather to employ any
other Principle, in explaining the Origin of moral
Good and Evil. But 'tis no ju&s;t Rea&s;on for rejecting
any Principle, confirm'd by Experience, that we can
give no &s;atisfactory Account of its Origin, nor are
able to re&s;olve it into other more general Principles.
And if we would employ a little Thought on the
pre&s;ent Subject, we need be at no Lo&s;s to account for
the Influence of Utility, and to deduce it from Prin|ciples,
the mo&s;t known and avow'd in human Na|ture.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="79">
FROM the apparent U&s;efulne&s;s of the &s;ocial Virtues,
it has readily been inferr'd by Sceptics, both antient
and modern, that all moral Di&s;tinctions ari&s;e from
Education, and were, at fir&s;t, invented, and after|wards
encourag'd, by the Arts of Politicians, in order
to render Men tractable, and &s;ubdue their natural
Ferocity and Selfi&s;hne&s;s, which incapacitated them
for Society. This Principle, indeed, of Precept and
Education mu&s;t be &s;o far own'd to have a powerful
Influence, that it may frequently encrea&s;e or dimi|ni&s;h,
beyond their natural Standard, the Sentiments
of Approbation or Di&s;like; and may even, in par|ticular
In&s;tances, create, without any natural Prin|ciple,
a new Sentiment of this Kind; as is evident
in all &s;uper&s;titious Practices and Ob&s;ervances: But
that <HI>all</HI> moral Affection or Di&s;like ari&s;es from this
Origin will never &s;urely be allow'd by any judicious
Enquirer. Had Nature made no &s;uch Di&s;tinction,
founded on the original Frame and Con&s;titution of
the Mind, the Words, <HI>honourable</HI> and <HI>&s;hameful, lovely</HI>
and <HI>odious, noble</HI> and <HI>de&s;picable,</HI> never had had place
in any Language; nor could Politicians, had they
invented the&s;e Terms, ever have been able to render
them intelligible, or make them convey any Idea to
the Audience. So that nothing can be more &s;uper|ficial
than this Paradox of the Sceptics; and 'twere
well, if, in the ab&s;tru&s;er Studies of Logics and Me|taphy&s;ics,
<PB N="77" REF="80">
we could as ea&s;ily get rid of the Cavils of
that Sect, as in the more practical and intelligible
Sciences of Politics and Morals.</P>
<P>THE &s;ocial Virtues mu&s;t, therefore, be allow'd to
have a natural Beauty and Amiablene&s;s, which, at
fir&s;t, antecedent to all Precept or Education, recom|mends
them to the E&s;teem of unin&s;tructed Mankind,
and engages their Affections. And as the Utility of
the&s;e Virtues is the chief Circum&s;tance, whence they
derive their Merit, it follows, that the End, which
they have a Tendency to promote, mu&s;t be &s;ome
way agreeable to us, and take hold of &s;ome natural
Affection. It mu&s;t plea&s;e, either from Con&s;iderations
of Self-intere&s;t, or from more generous Motives and
Regards.</P>
<P>IT has often been a&s;&s;erted, that, as every Man has
a &s;trong Connexion with Society, and perceives the
Impo&s;&s;ibility of his &s;olitary Sub&s;i&s;tence, he becomes,
on that Account, favourable to all tho&s;e Habits or
Principles, which promote Order in Society, and en|&s;ure
to him the quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o ine&s;timable a
Ble&s;&s;ing. As much as we value our own Happine&s;s
and Welfare, as much mu&s;t we value the Practice of
Ju&s;tice and Humanity, by which alone the &s;ocial
Confederacy can be maintain'd, and every Man reap
the Fruits of mutual Protection and A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

THIS Deduction of Morals from Self-love or a

no others, <HI>Polybius,</HI> one of the grave&s;t, and mo&s;t

<P>WE frequently be&s;tow Prai&s;es on virtuous Actions,
perform'd in very di&s;tant Ages and remote Countries;

<P>WHERE private Advantage concurs with general
Affection for Virtue, we readily perceive and avow
the Mixture of the&s;e di&s;tinct Sentiments, which have
a very different Feeling and Influence on the Mind.
We prai&s;e, perhaps, with more Alacrity, where the
generous, humane Action contributes to our particu|lar
Intere&s;t: But the Topics of Prai&s;e we in&s;i&s;t on
are very wide of this Circum&s;tance. And we may
attempt to bring over others to our Sentiments, with|out

<P>SELF-LOVE is a Principle in human Na|ture
of &s;uch exten&s;ive Energy, and the Intere&s;t
of each Individual is, in general, &s;o clo&s;ely con|nected
with that of Community, that tho&s;e Philo&s;o|phers
were excu&s;able, who fancy'd, that all our
Concern for the Public might, perhaps, be re&s;olv'd
into a Concern for our own Happine&s;s and Pre&s;er|vation.
They &s;aw, every Moment, In&s;tances of Ap|probation
or Blame, Satisfaction or Di&s;plea&s;ure to|wards
Characters and Actions; they denominated the
Objects of the&s;e Sentiments, <HI>Virtues</HI> or <HI>Vices;</HI> they
ob&s;erv'd, that the former had a Tendency to en|crea&s;e
the Happine&s;s, and the latter the Mi&s;ery of
Society; they a&s;k'd, if it was po&s;&s;ible we could have
any general Concern for Society, or any di&s;intere&s;ted
Re&s;entment of the Welfare or Injury of others;
they found it &s;impler to con&s;ider all the&s;e Sentiments
as Modifications of Self-love; and they di&s;cover'd
a Pretext, at lea&s;t, for this Unity of Principle, in
that clo&s;e Union of Intere&s;t, which is &s;o ob&s;ervable
betwixt the Public and each Individual.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding this frequent Confu&s;ion of
Intere&s;ts, 'tis ea&s;y to attain what natural Philo&s;o|phers,
after my Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> have affected to call
<PB N="84" REF="87">
the <HI>Experimentum crucis,</HI> or that Experiment, which
points out the Way we &s;hould follow, in any Doubt
or Ambiguity. We have found In&s;tances, wherein
private Intere&s;t was &s;eparate from public; wherein
it was even contrary: And yet we ob&s;erv'd the
moral Sentiment to continue, notwith&s;tanding this
Disjunction of Intere&s;ts. And wherever the&s;e di&s;tinct
Intere&s;ts &s;en&s;ibly concur'd, we always found a &s;en|&s;ible
Encrea&s;e of the Sentiment, and a more warm
Affection to Virtue, and Dete&s;tation of Vice, or what
we properly call, <HI>Gratitude</HI> and <HI>Revenge.</HI> Compell'd
by the&s;e In&s;tances, we mu&s;t renounce the Theory,
which accounts for every moral Sentiment by the
Principle of Self-love. We mu&s;t adopt a more pub|lic
Affection, and allow, that the Intere&s;ts of Society
are not, even on their own Account, altogether indif|ferent
to us. U&s;efulne&s;s is only a Tendency to a cer|tain
End; and 'tis a Contradiction in Terms, that any
Thing plea&s;es as Means to an End, where the End
it&s;elf does no way affect us. If therefore U&s;efulne&s;s
be a Source of moral Sentiment, and if this U&s;eful|ne&s;s
be not always con&s;ider'd with a Reference to
Self; it follows, that every Thing, which contri|butes
to the Happine&s;s of Society, recommends it|&s;elf
directly to our Approbation and Good-will.
Here is a Principle, which accounts, in great Part,
for the Origin of Morality: And what need we &s;eek

for ab&s;tru&s;e and remote Sy&s;tems, when there occurs
one &s;o obvious and natural<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis needle&s;s to pu&s;h our Re&s;earches &s;o far as to a&s;k, why we have Humanity or a Fellow-feeling with others.

We mu&s;t &s;top &s;omewhere in our Examination of Cau&s;es; and there are, in every Science, &s;ome general Principles, beyond which we cannot hope to find any Principle more general. No Man is ab&s;olutely indifferent to the Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery of others. The fir&s;t has a natural Tendency to give Plea&s;ure; the &s;econd, Pain. This every one may find in him&s;elf.

But if it were po&s;&s;ible, it belongs not to the pre&s;ent Subject; and we may here &s;afely con&s;ider the&s;e Principles as original: Happy, if we can render all the Con&s;equences &s;uffi|ciently plain and per&s;picuous.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>HAVE we any Difficulty to comprehend the Force
of Humanity and Benevolence? Or to conceive,
that the very A&s;pect of Happine&s;s, Joy, Pro&s;perity,
gives Plea&s;ure; that of Pain, Sufferance, Sorrow,
communicates Unea&s;ine&s;s? The human Countenance,
&s;ays <HI>Horace</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><L>Uti ridentibus arrident, ita flentibus adflent</L>

Movements in his Fellow-creatures. The Signs of
Sorrow and Mourning, tho' arbitrary, affect us with
Melancholy; but the natural Symptoms, Tears,

<P>WE enter, I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, into a convenient,

<P>IN general, 'tis certain, that wherever we go,
whatever we reflect on or conver&s;e about; every

our &s;erious Occupations, in our carele&s;s Amu&s;ements,
this Principle &s;till exerts its active Energy.</P>
<P>A MAN, who enters the Theatre, is immediately
&s;truck with the View of &s;o great a Multitude, par|ticipating

<P>EVERY Movement of the Theatre, by a &s;killful
Poet, is communicated, as it were by Magic, to the
Spectators, who weep, tremble, re&s;ent, rejoice, and
are enflam'd with all the Variety of Pa&s;&s;ions, which
actuate the &s;everal Per&s;onages of the Drama.</P>
<P>WHERE any Event cro&s;&s;es our Wi&s;hes, and inter|rupts
the Happine&s;s of the favourite Per&s;onages, we
feel a &s;en&s;ible Anxiety and Concern. But where
their Sufferings proceed from the Treachery, Cruelty
or Tyranny of an Enemy, our Brea&s;ts are affected
with the livelie&s;t Re&s;entment again&s;t the Author of
the&s;e Calamities.</P>
<P>'TIS here e&s;teem'd contrary to the Rules of Art
to repre&s;ent any Thing cool and indifferent. A

Intere&s;t in the Cata&s;trophe, ought, if po&s;&s;ible, to
be avoided by the Poet; as communicating a like

Indifference to the Audience, and checking the
Progre&s;s of the Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>No Species of Poetry is more entertaining than
<HI>Pa&s;toral;</HI> and every one is &s;en&s;ible, that the chief
Source of its Plea&s;ure ari&s;es from tho&s;e Images of a
gentle and tender Tranquillity, which it repre&s;ents
in its Per&s;onages, and of which it communicates a
like Sentiment to the Readers. <HI>Sannazarius,</HI> who
transfer'd the Scene to the Sea-&s;hore, tho' he pre|&s;ented
the mo&s;t magnificent Object in Nature, is
confe&s;t to have err'd in his Choice. The Idea of
Toil, Labour, and Danger, &s;uffer'd by the Fi&s;her|men,
is painful, by an unavoidable Sympathy, which
attends every Conception of human Happine&s;s or
Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>WHEN I was twenty, &s;ays a <HI>French</HI> Poet, <HI>Ovid</HI>
was my Choice: Now I am forty, I declare for
<HI>Horace.</HI> We enter, to be &s;ure, more readily into
Sentiments, that re&s;emble tho&s;e we feel every Mo|ment:
But no Pa&s;&s;ion, when well repre&s;ented, can
be altogether indifferent to us; becau&s;e there is
none, of which every Man has not within him, at
lea&s;t, the Seeds and fir&s;t Principles. 'Tis the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
of Poetry to approach every Object by lively
Imagery and De&s;cription, and make it look like
Truth and Reality: A certain Proof, that wherever
<PB N="90" REF="93">
that Reality is found, our Minds are di&s;pos'd to be
&s;trongly affected by it.</P>
<P>ANY recent Event or Piece of News, by which

tho&s;e who&s;e Welfare is not immediately engag'd.
Such Intelligence is propagated with Celerity, heard
with Avidity, and enquir'd into with Attention and

each Individual. The Imagination is &s;ure to be af|fected;

All Mankind &s;o far re&s;emble the good Principle,
that where Intere&s;t or Revenge or Envy perverts not
our Di&s;po&s;ition, we are always enclin'd, from our
natural Philanthropy, to give the Preference to the
Happine&s;s of Society, and con&s;equently to Virtue,
above its oppo&s;ite. Ab&s;olute, unprovok'd, di&s;inter|e&s;ted
Malice has never, perhaps, Place in any human
Brea&s;t; or if it had, mu&s;t there pervert all the Sen|timents
of Morals, as well as the Feelings of Huma|nity.
If the Cruelty of <HI>Nero</HI> be allow'd altogether
voluntary, and not rather the Effect of con&s;tant
Fear and Re&s;entment; 'tis evident, that <HI>Tigellinus,</HI>

<P>A STATESMAN or Patriot, that &s;erves our own
Country, in our own Time, has always a more
pa&s;&s;ionate Regard paid him, than one who&s;e bene|ficial
Influence operated on di&s;tant Ages or remote
Nations; where the Good, re&s;ulting from his gene|rous
Humanity, being le&s;s connected with us, &s;eems
more ob&s;cure, and affects us with a le&s;s lively Sym|pathy.
We may own the Merit to be equally great,
tho' our Sentiments are not rais'd to an equal
Height, in both Ca&s;es. The Judgment here cor|rects
the Inequalities of our internal Emotions and
Perceptions; in like Manner, as it pre&s;erves us from
Error, in the &s;everal Variations of Images, pre&s;ented
to our external Sen&s;es. The &s;ame Object, at a
double Di&s;tance, really throws on the Eye a Picture
of but half the Bulk; and yet we imagine it ap|pears
of the &s;ame Size in both Situations; becau&s;e
we know, that, on our Approach to it, its Image
would expand on the Sen&s;es, and that the Difference
con&s;i&s;ts not in the Object it&s;elf, but in our Po&s;ition
with regard to it. And, indeed, without &s;uch Cor|rection
of Appearances, both in internal and exter|nal
Sentiment, Men could never think or talk
&s;teadily on any Subject; while their fluctuating Si|tuations
produce a continual Variation on Objects,
<PB N="98" REF="101">
and throw them into &s;uch different and contrary
Lights and Po&s;itions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>For a like Rea&s;on, the Tendencies of Actions and Cha|racters, not their real accidental Con&s;equences, are alone re|garded in our moral Determinations or general Judgments; tho' in our real Feeling or Sentiment, we cannot help paying greater Regard to one who&s;e Station, join'd to Virtue, renders him really u&s;eful to Society, than to one, who exerts the &s;ocial Vir|tues only in good Intentions and benevolent Affections. Separat|ing the Character from the Fortune, by an ea&s;y and nece&s;&s;ary Effert of Thought, we pronounce the&s;e Per&s;ons alike, and give them the &s;ame general Prai&s;e.

<P>THE more we conver&s;e with Mankind, and the
greater &s;ocial Entercour&s;e we maintain, the more
will we be familiariz'd to the&s;e general Preferences
and Di&s;tinctions, without which our Conver&s;ation
and Di&s;cour&s;e could &s;carcely be render'd intelligible
to each other. Every Man's Intere&s;t is peculiar to
him&s;elf, and the Aver&s;ions and De&s;ires, which re|&s;ult
from it, cannot be &s;uppos'd to affect others in a
<PB N="99" REF="102">
like Degree. General Language, therefore, being
form'd for general U&s;e, mu&s;t be moulded on &s;ome
more general Views, and mu&s;t affix the Epithets of
Prai&s;e or Blame, in Conformity to Sentiments,
which ari&s;e from the general Intere&s;ts of the Com|munity.
And if the&s;e Sentiments, in mo&s;t Men,
be not &s;o &s;trong as tho&s;e, which have a Reference
to private Good; yet &s;till they mu&s;t make &s;ome
Di&s;tinction, even in Per&s;ons the mo&s;t deprav'd and
&s;elfi&s;h; and mu&s;t attach the Notion of Good to a
beneficent Conduct, and of Evil to the contrary.
Sympathy, we &s;hall allow, is much fainter than our
Concern for Our&s;elves, and Sympathy with Per&s;ons,
remote from us, much &s;ainter than that with Per&s;ons,
near and contiguous; but for this very Rea&s;on,
'tis nece&s;&s;ary for us, in our calm Judgments and
Di&s;cour&s;e concerning the Characters of Men, to
neglect all the&s;e Differences, and render our Senti|ments
more public and &s;ocial. Be&s;ides, that we
Our&s;elves often change our Situation in this Parti|cular,
we every Day meet with Per&s;ons, who are in a
different Situation from us, and who could never con|ver&s;e
with us on any rea&s;onable Terms, were we to
remain con&s;tantly in that Po&s;ition and Point of View,
which is peculiar to Our&s;elf. The Entercour&s;e of
Sentiments, therefore, in Society and Conver&s;ation
makes us form &s;ome general, inalterable Standard,
by which we may approve or di&s;approve of Cha|racters
<PB N="100" REF="103">
and Manners. And tho' the Heart takes not
part entirely with tho&s;e general Notions, nor regu|lates
all its Love and Hatred, by the univer&s;al, ab|&s;tract
Differences of Vice and Virtue, without re|gard
to Self or the Per&s;ons, with whom we are more
immediately connected; yet have the&s;e moral Dif|ferences
a con&s;iderable Influence, and being &s;uffici|ent,

<P>THUS, in whatever Light we take this Subject,
the Merit, a&s;crib'd to the &s;ocial Virtues, appears
&s;till uniform, and ari&s;es chiefly from that Regard,
which the natural Sentiment of Benevolence engages
us to pay to the Intere&s;ts of Mankind and Society.
If we con&s;ider the Principles of the human Make;
&s;uch as they appear to daily Experience and Ob&s;er|vation
<PB N="101" REF="104">
we mu&s;t, <HI>a priori,</HI> conclude it impo&s;&s;ible for
&s;uch a Creature as Man to be totally indifferent to
the Well or Ill-being of his Fellow-creatures, and
not readily, of him&s;elf, to pronounce, where no|thing
gives him any particular Bya&s;s, that what pro|motes
their Happine&s;s is good, what tends to their
Mi&s;ery is evil, without any farther Regard or Con|&s;ideration.
Here then are the faint Rudiments, at
lea&s;t, or Outlines, of a <HI>general</HI> Di&s;tinction betwixt
Actions; and in Proportion as the Humanity of the
Per&s;on is &s;uppos'd to encrea&s;e, his Connexion to
tho&s;e injur'd or benefited, and his lively Conception
of their Mi&s;ery or Happine&s;s; his con&s;equent Cen|&s;ure
or Approbation acquires proportionable Force
and Vigour. There is no Nece&s;&s;ity, that a generous
Action, barely mention'd in an old Hi&s;tory or remote
Gazette, &s;hould communicate any &s;trong Feelings of
Applau&s;e and Admiration. Virtue, plac'd at &s;uch a
Di&s;tance, is like a fixt Star, which, tho', to the Eye
of Rea&s;on, it may appear as luminous as the Sun in
his Meridian, is &s;o infinitely remov'd, as to affect
the Sen&s;es, neither with Light nor Heat. Bring this
Virtue nearer, by our Acquaintance or Connexion
with the Per&s;ons, or even by an eloquent Narration
and Recital of the Ca&s;e; our Hearts are immediately
caught, our Sympathy enliven'd, and our cool Ap|probation
converted into the warme&s;t Sentiments of
Friend&s;hip and Regard. The&s;e &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary and
<PB N="102" REF="105">
infallible Con&s;equences of the general Principles of
human Nature, as di&s;cover'd in common Life and
Practice.</P>
<P>AGAIN; rever&s;e the&s;e Views and Rea&s;onings:
Con&s;ider the Matter <HI>a po&s;teriori;</HI> and weighing the
Con&s;equences, enquire, if the Merit of all &s;ocial
Virtue is not deriv'd from the Feelings of Humanity,
with which it affects the Spectators. It appears to be
Matter of Fact, that the Circum&s;tance of <HI>Utility,</HI>
in all Subjects, is a Source of Prai&s;e and Approba|tion:
That it is con&s;tantly appeal'd to in all moral
Deci&s;ions concerning the Merit and Demerit of
Actions: That it is the <HI>&s;ole</HI> Source of that high Re|gard
paid to Ju&s;tice, Fidelity, Honour, Allegiance
and Cha&s;tity: That it is in&s;eperable from all the
other &s;ocial Virtues of Humanity, Genero&s;ity, Cha|rity,
Affability, Lenity, Mercy and Moderation:
And in a Word, that it is the Foundation of the
chief Part of Morals, which has a Reference to
Mankind and Society.</P>
<P>IT appears al&s;o, in our general Approbation or
Judgment of Characters and Manners, that the u&s;e|ful
Tendency of the &s;ocial Virtues moves us not by
any Regards to Self-intere&s;t, but has an Influence
much more univer&s;al and exten&s;ive. It appears,
that a Tendency to public Good, and to the pro|moting
<PB N="103" REF="106">
of Peace, Harmony, and Concord in So|ciety,
by affecting the benevolent Principles of our
Frame, engages us on the Side of the &s;ocial Virtues.
And it appears, as an additional Confirmation, that
the&s;e Principles of Humanity and Sympathy enter
&s;o deep into all our Sentiments, and have &s;o power|ful
an Influence, as may enable them to excite the
&s;tronge&s;t Cen&s;ure and Applau&s;e. The pre&s;ent
Theory is the &s;imple Re&s;ult of all the&s;e Inferences,
each of which &s;eems founded on uniform Experience
and Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>WERE it doubtful, whether there was any &s;uch
Principle in our Nature as Humanity or a Concern
for others, yet when we &s;ee, in numberle&s;s In&s;tances,
that, whatever has a Tendency to promote the In|tere&s;ts
of Society, is &s;o highly approv'd of, we ought
thence to learn the Force of the benevolent Principle;
&s;ince 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for any Thing to plea&s;e as Means
to an End, where the End it&s;elf is totally indifferent:
On the other Hand, were it doubtful, whether there
was, implanted in our Natures, any general Prin|ciple
of moral Blame and Approbation, yet when
we &s;ee, in numberle&s;s In&s;tances, the Influence of
Humanity, we ought thence to conclude, that 'tis
impo&s;&s;ible, but that every Thing, which promotes
the Intere&s;ts of Society, mu&s;t communicate Plea&s;ure,
and what is pernicious give Unea&s;ine&s;s. But when
<PB N="104" REF="107">
the&s;e different Reflections and Ob&s;ervations concur
in e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;ame Conclu&s;ion, mu&s;t they not
be&s;tow an undi&s;puted Evidence upon it?</P>
<P>'Tis however hop'd, that the Progre&s;s of this Ar|gument
will bring a farther Confirmation of the pre|&s;ent
Theory, by &s;howing the Ri&s;e of other Senti|ments
of E&s;teem and Regard from the &s;ame or like
Principles.</P>

<P>NOTHING is more u&s;ual, than for Philo&s;o|phers
to encroach upon the Province of Gram|marians;
and to engage in Di&s;putes of Words, while
they imagine, that they are handling Controver&s;ies
of the deepe&s;t Importance and Concern. Thus,
were we here to a&s;&s;ert or to deny, <HI>that all laudable
Qualities of the Mind were to be con&s;ider'd as Virtues or
moral Attributes,</HI> many would imagine, that we had
enter'd upon one of the profounde&s;t Speculations of
Ethics; tho' 'tis probable, all the while, that the
greate&s;t Part of the Di&s;pute would be found entirely
verbal. To avoid, therefore, all frivolous Subtilties
and Altercations, as much as po&s;&s;ible, we &s;hall con|tent
Our&s;elves with ob&s;erving, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that, in common
Life, the Sentiments of Cen&s;ure or Approbation,
produc'd by mental Qualities of every Kind, are
<PB N="106" REF="109">
very &s;imilar; and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that all antient Morali&s;ts,
(the be&s;t Models) in treating of them, make little or
no Difference among&s;t them.</P>
<P><HI>FIRST.</HI> It &s;eems certain, that the <HI>Sentiment</HI>
of con&s;cious Worth, the Self-&s;atisfaction, proceeding
from a Review of a Man's own Conduct and Cha|racter;
it &s;eems certain, I &s;ay, that this Sentiment,
which, tho' the mo&s;t common of all others, has no
proper Name in our Language<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Term, Pride, is commenly taken in a bad Sen&s;e; but this Sentiment &s;eems indifferent, and may be either good or bad, according as it is well or ill founded, and according to the other Circum&s;tances, that accompany it. The <HI>French</HI> expre&s;s this Sentiment by the Term, <HI>amour propre,</HI> but as they al&s;o ex|pre&s;s Self-love as well as Vanity, by the &s;ame Term, there ari&s;es thence a great Confu&s;ion in <HI>Rocbefoucault,</HI> and many of their moral Writers,</NOTE> ari&s;es from the
Endowments of Courage and Capacity, Indu&s;try and
Ingenuity, as well as from any other mental Excel|lencies.
Who, on the other Hand, is not deeply
mortify'd with reflecting on his own Folly or Di&s;&s;o|lutene&s;s,
and feels not a &s;ecret Sting or Compunction,
whenever his Memory pre&s;ents any pa&s;t Occurence,
where he behav'd with Stupidity or Ill-manners?
No Time can efface the cruel Ideas of a Man's own
Ill-conduct, or of Affronts, which Cowardice or
Impudence have brought upon him. They &s;till
<PB N="107" REF="110">
haunt his &s;olitary Hours, damp his mo&s;t a&s;piring
Thoughts, and &s;how him, even to him&s;elf, in the
mo&s;t contemptible and mo&s;t odious Colours imagin|able.</P>
<P>WHAT is there too we are more anxious to conceal
from others than &s;uch Blunders, Infirmities, and
Meanne&s;&s;es, or more dread to have expos'd by Rail|lery
and Satyre? And is not the chief Object of
Vanity, our Bravery or Learning, our Wit or Breed|ing,
our Eloquence or Addre&s;s, our Ta&s;te or Ability?
The&s;e we di&s;play with Care, if not with O&s;tentation;
and commonly &s;how more Ambition of excelling in
them, than even in the &s;ocial Virtues them&s;elves,
which are, in Reality, of &s;uch &s;uperior Excellence.
Good-nature and Hone&s;ty, e&s;pecially the latter, are
&s;o indi&s;pen&s;ibly requir'd, that, tho' the greate&s;t Cen|&s;ure
attends any Violation of the&s;e Duties, no emi|nent
Prai&s;e follows &s;uch common In&s;tances of them,
as &s;eem e&s;&s;ential to the Support of human Society.
And hence the Rea&s;on, in my Opinion, why, tho'
Men often prai&s;e &s;o liberally the Qualities of their
Heart, they are &s;hy of commending the Endowments
of their Head; becau&s;e the latter Virtues, being &s;up|pos'd
more rare and extraordinary, are ob&s;erv'd to be
the more u&s;ual Objects of Pride and Self-conceit;
and when boa&s;ted of, beget a &s;trong Su&s;picion of the&s;e
Sentiments.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="111">
'Tis hard to tell, whether you hurt a Man's Cha|racter
mo&s;t by calling him a Knave or a Coward, and
whether a bea&s;ily Glutton or Drunkard be not as
odious and contemptible as a &s;elfi&s;h, ungenerous
Mi&s;er. Give me my Choice; and I would rather,
for my own Happine&s;s and Self-enjoyment, have a
friendly, humane Heart than po&s;&s;e&s;s all the other
Virtues of <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> united: But I would
rather pa&s;s with the World for one endow'd with ex|ten&s;ive
Genius and intrepid Courage, and &s;hould
thence expect &s;tronger In&s;tances of general Applau&s;e
and Admiration. The Figure a Man makes in Life,
the Reception he meets with in Company, the E&s;teem
paid him by his Acquaintance; all the&s;e Advantages
depend as much upon his good Sen&s;e and Judgment
as upon any other Part of his Character. Had a
Man the be&s;t Intentions in the World, and were the
farthe&s;t remov'd from all Inju&s;tice and Violence, he
would never be able to make him&s;elf be much re|garded,

<P>WHAT is it then we can here di&s;pute about? If

than one entirely devoid of them; if, in &s;hort, the
<HI>Sentiments</HI> be &s;imilar, that ari&s;e from the&s;e Endow|ments

for being &s;o extremely &s;crupulous about a <HI>Word,</HI>
or doubting whether they are entitled to the Deno|mination
of Virtue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;eems to me, that in our Language, Courage, Tempe|rance, Indu&s;try, Frugality, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> according to popular Stile, are call'd <HI>Virtues;</HI> but when a Man is &s;aid to be <HI>virtuous,</HI> or is deno|minated a Man of Virtue, we chiefly regard his &s;ocial Qualities.

The <HI>Sen|timents</HI> of Men, being more uniform, as well as more important, are a fitter Subject of Speculation: Tho' at the &s;ame Time, we may ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that wherever the &s;ocial Virtues are talk'd of, 'tis plainly imploy'd, by this Di&s;tinction, that there are al&s;o other Virtues of a different Nature.</NOTE>? It may, indeed, be pre|tended, that the Sentiment of Approbation, which
tho&s;e Accompli&s;hments produce, be&s;ides its being <HI>in|ferior,</HI>
is al&s;o &s;omewhat <HI>different</HI> from that, which
attends the Virtues of Ju&s;tice and Humanity. But
this &s;eems not a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for ranking them
entirely under different Cla&s;&s;es and Appellations.
The Character of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and that of <HI>Cato,</HI> as drawn
by <HI>Salu&s;t,</HI> are both of them virtuous, in the &s;tricte&s;t
Sen&s;e of the Word; but in a different Way: Nor
are the Sentiments entirely the &s;ame, which ari&s;e
from them. The one produces Love; the other,
<PB N="110" REF="113">
E&s;teem: The one is amiable; the other awful: We
could wi&s;h to meet the one Character in a Friend;
the other we &s;hould be ambitious of in Our&s;elves.
In like Manner the Approbation, which attends na|tural
Abilities or Temperance or Indu&s;try, may be
&s;omewhat different from that which is paid to the
&s;ocial Virtues, without making them entirely of a
different Species. And indeed, we may ob&s;erve,
that the natural Abilities, no more than the other
Virtues, produce not, all of them, the &s;ame Kind of
Approbation. Good Sen&s;e and Genius beget E&s;teem
and Regard: Wit and Humour excite Love and Af|fection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Love and E&s;teem are nearly the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion, and ari&s;e from &s;imilar Cau&s;es.

But where this Plea&s;ure is &s;evere and &s;erious; or where its Object is great and makes a &s;trong Im|pre&s;&s;ion, or where it produces any Degree of Humility and Awe: In all the&s;e Ca&s;es, the Pa&s;&s;ion, which ari&s;es from the Plea&s;ure, is more properly denominated E&s;teem than Love. Be|nevolence attends both: But is connected with Love in a more eminent Degree. There &s;eems to be &s;till a &s;tronger Mixture of Pride in Contempt than of Humility in E&s;teem; and the Rea&s;on would not be difficult to one, who &s;tudy'd accurately the Pa&s;&s;ions. All the&s;e various Mixtures and Compo&s;itions and Appearances of Sentiment form a very curious Subject of Speculation, but are wide of our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e. Thro'out the&s;e E&s;&s;ays, we always con&s;ider in general, what Qualities are a Subject of Prai&s;e or of Cen&s;ure, without entering into all the minute Differences of Sen|timent, which they excite. 'Tis evident, that whatever is con|temn'd, is al&s;o di&s;lik'd, as well as what is hated; and we here endeavour to take Objects, according to their mo&s;t &s;imple Views and Appearances.

<P>IN general, we may ob&s;erve, that the Di&s;tinction

<P>IT &s;eems evident, that where a Quality or Habit
is &s;ubjected to our Examination, if it appear, in
any re&s;pect, prejudicial to the Per&s;on, po&s;&s;e&s;t of it,
or &s;uch as incapacitates him for Bu&s;ine&s;s and Action,
it is in&s;tantly blam'd, and rank'd among&s;t his Faults
and Imperfections. Indolence, Negligence, Want
of Order and Method, Ob&s;tinacy, Ficklene&s;s, Ra&s;h|ne&s;s,
Credulity; no one ever e&s;teem'd the&s;e Qua|lities,
indifferent to a Character; much le&s;s, extoll'd
them as Accompli&s;hments or Virtues. The Preju|dice,
re&s;ulting from them, immediately &s;trikes our
<PB N="118" REF="121">
Eye, and gives us the Sentiment of Pain and Di&s;|approbation.</P>
<P>No Qualiity, 'tis allow'd, is ab&s;olutely either
blameable or prai&s;e-worthy. 'Tis all according to
its Degrees. A due Medium, &s;ay the <HI>Peripatetics,</HI>
is the Characteri&s;tic of Virtue. But this Medium is
chiefly determin'd by Utility. A proper Celerity,
for In&s;tance, and Di&s;patch in Bu&s;ine&s;s is commend|able.
When defective, no Progre&s;s is ever made in
the Execution of any Purpo&s;e: When exce&s;&s;ive, it
engages us in precipitate, and ill-concerted Mea&s;ures
and Enterprizes. By &s;uch Rea&s;onings as the&s;e we
fix the proper and commendable Mediocrity in all
moral and prudential Di&s;qui&s;itions; and never lo&s;e
View of the Advantages, which re&s;ult from any
Character or Habit.</P>
<P>Now as the&s;e Advantages are enjoy'd by the Per|&s;on,
po&s;&s;e&s;t of the Character, it can never be <HI>Self-love,</HI>
which renders the Pro&s;pect of them agreeable
to us, the Spectators, and prompts our E&s;teem and
Approbation. No Force of Imagination can con|vert
us into another Per&s;on, and make us fancy,
that we being that Per&s;on, reap Benefit from tho&s;e
valuable Qualities, which belong to him. Or if it
did, no Celerity of Imagination could immediately
tran&s;port us back, into our&s;elves, and make us love
and e&s;teem the Per&s;on, as different from us. Views
<PB N="119" REF="122">
and Sentiments, &s;o oppo&s;ite to known Truth, and to
each other, could never have place, at the &s;ame
Time, in the &s;ame Per&s;on. All Su&s;picion, therefore, of
&s;elfi&s;h Regards are here totally excluded. 'Tis a quite
different Principle, which actuates our Bo&s;om, and
intere&s;ts us in the Felicity of the Per&s;on we contem|plate.
Where his natural Talents and acquir'd Abi|lities
give us the Pro&s;pect of Elevation, Advance|ment,
a Figure in Life, pro&s;perous Succe&s;s, a &s;teady
Command over Fortune, and the Execution of great
or advantageous Undertakings; we are &s;truck with
&s;uch agreeable Images, and feel a Complacency and
Regard immediately ari&s;e towards him. The Ideas
of Happine&s;s, Joy, Triumph, Pro&s;perity are con|nected
with every Circum&s;tance of his Character,
and diffu&s;e over our Minds a plea&s;ing Sentiment of
Sympathy and Humanity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One may venture to affirm, that there is no human Creature, to whom the Appearance of Happine&s;s, (where Envy or Revenge has no Place) does not give Plea&s;ure, that of Mi&s;ery, Unea&s;ine&s;s. This &s;eems in&s;eperable from our Make and Con&s;titution. But they are only the more generous Minds, that are thence prompted to &s;eek zealou&s;ly the Good of others, and to have a real Pa&s;&s;ion for their Welfare. With Men of narrow and ungenerous Spirits, this Sym|pathy goes not beyond a &s;light Feeling of the Imagination, which &s;erves only to excite Sentiments of Complacency or Cen&s;ure, and make them apply to the Object either honourable or di&s;honourable Appellations. A griping Mi&s;er, for In&s;tance, prai&s;es extremely <HI>Indu&s;try</HI> and <HI>Frugality,</HI> even in others, and &s;ets them, in his E&s;ti|mation, above all the other Virtues. He knows the Good, that re&s;ults from them, and feels that Species of Happine&s;s with a more lively Sympathy, than any other you could repre&s;ent to him; tho' perhaps he would not part with a Shilling to make the Fortune of the indu&s;trious Man, whom he prai&s;es &s;o highly.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="123">
LET us &s;uppo&s;e a Per&s;on originally &s;o fram'd as
to have no Manner of Concern for his Fellow crea|tures,
but to regard the Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery of
all &s;en&s;ible Beings with greater Indifference even
than two contiguous Shades of the &s;ame Colour.
Let us &s;uppo&s;e, if the Pro&s;perity of Nations were
lay'd on the one hand and their Ruin on the other,
and he were de&s;ir'd to choo&s;e; that he would &s;tand,
like the Schoolman's A&s;s, irre&s;olute and undeter|min'd,
betwixt equal Motives; or rather, like the
&s;ame A&s;s betwixt two Pieces of Wood or Marble,
without any Inclination or Propen&s;ity on either Side.
The Con&s;equence, I believe, mu&s;t be allow'd ju&s;t,
that &s;uch a Per&s;on, being ab&s;olutely unconcern'd,
either as to the public Good of a Community or the
private Utility of others, would look on every Qua|lity,
however pernicious, or however beneficial, to
Society or to its Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, with the &s;ame Indifference
as on the mo&s;t common and unintere&s;ting Object.</P>
<P>BUT if, in&s;tead of this fancy'd Mon&s;ter, we &s;up|po&s;e
a <HI>Man</HI> to form a Judgment or Determination in
<PB N="121" REF="124">
the Ca&s;e; there is to him a plain Foundation of
Preference, where every Thing el&s;e is equal; and
however cool his Choice may be, if his Heart be
&s;elfi&s;h, or if the Per&s;ons intere&s;ted be remote from
him; there mu&s;t &s;till be a Choice, and a Di&s;tinction
betwixt what is u&s;eful, and what is pernicious. Now
this Di&s;tinction is the &s;ame in all its Parts, with the
<HI>moral Di&s;tinction,</HI> who&s;e Foundation has been &s;o o&s;|ten,
and &s;o much in vain, enquir'd after. The &s;ame
Endowments of the Mind, in every Circum&s;tance,
are agreeable to the Sentiment of Morals and to that
of Humanity; the &s;ame Temper is &s;u&s;ceptible of
high Degrees of the one Sentiment and of the other;
and the &s;ame Alteration in the Objects, by their
nearer Approach or by Connexions, enlivens the one
and the other. By all the Rules of Philo&s;ophy,
therefore, we mu&s;t conclude, that the&s;e Sentiments
are originally the &s;ame; &s;ince, in each particular,
even the mo&s;t minute, they are govern'd by the &s;ame
Laws, and are mov'd by the &s;ame Objects.</P>
<P>WHY do Philo&s;ophers infer, with the greate&s;t
Certainty, that the Moon is kept in its Orbit by the
&s;ame Force of Gravity, which makes Bodies fall
near the Surface of the Earth, but becau&s;e the&s;e
Effects are, upon Computation, found &s;imilar and
equal? And mu&s;t not this Argument bring equal
Conviction, in moral as in natural Di&s;qui&s;itions?</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="125">
To prove, by any long Detail, that all the Qua|lities,
u&s;eful to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, are approv'd, and the
contrary cen&s;ur'd, would be &s;uperfluous. The lea&s;t
Reflection, on what is every Day experienc'd in Life,
will be &s;ufficient. We &s;hall only mention a few In|&s;tances,
in order to remove, if po&s;&s;ible, all Doubt
and He&s;itation.</P>
<P>THE Quality, the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for the Execution
of any u&s;eful Enterprize, is DISCRETION;
by which we carry on a &s;afe Intercour&s;e with others,
give due Attention to our own and to their Character,
weigh each Circum&s;tance of the Bu&s;ine&s;s we under|take,
and employ the &s;ure&s;t and &s;afe&s;t Means for the
Attainment of any End or Purpo&s;e. To a <HI>Cromwell,</HI>
perhaps, or a <HI>De Retz,</HI> Di&s;cretion may appear an
Alderman-like Virtue, as Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> calls it; and
being incompatible with tho&s;e va&s;t De&s;igns, to which
their Courage and Ambition prompted them, it
might really, in them, be a Fault or Imperfection.
But in the Conduct of ordinary Life, no Virtue is
more requi&s;ite, not only to obtain Succe&s;s, but to
avoid the mo&s;t fatal Mi&s;carriages and Di&s;appoint|ments.
The greate&s;t Parts without it, as ob&s;erv'd by
an elegant Writer, may be fatal to their Owner; as
<HI>Polyphemus</HI> depriv'd of his Eye was only the more ex|pos'd,
<PB N="123" REF="126">
on Account of his enormous Strength and
Stature.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t Character, indeed, were it not rather too
perfect for human Nature, is that which gives no|thing
to Temper of any Kind; but alternately em|ploys
Enterprize and Caution, as each is <HI>u&s;eful</HI> to the
particular Purpo&s;e intended. Such is the Excellence,
which St. <HI>Evremond</HI> a&s;cribes to Mare&s;chal <HI>Turenne,</HI>
who di&s;play'd every Campaign, as he grew older,
more Temerity in his military Enterprizes; and be|ing
now, from long Experience, perfectly acquainted
with every Incident in War, he advanc'd with
greater Firmne&s;s and Boldne&s;s, in a Road &s;o well
known to him. <HI>Fabius,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Machiavel,</HI> was cau|tious;
<HI>Scipio</HI> enterprizing: And both &s;ucceeded,
becau&s;e the Situation of the <HI>Roman</HI> Affars, during
the Command of each, was peculiarly adapted to
his Genius; but both would have fail'd, had the&s;e
Situations been inverted. He is happy, who&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances
&s;uit his Temper; but he is more excellent,
who can &s;uit his Temper to any Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>WHAT need is there to di&s;play the Prai&s;es of
INDUSTRY, and to extol its Advantages, in
the Acqui&s;ition of Power and Riches, or in rai&s;ing
what we call a <HI>Fortune</HI> in the World? The Tortoi&s;e,
according to the Fable, by his A&s;&s;iduity, gain'd the
<PB N="124" REF="127">
Race of the Hare, tho' po&s;&s;e&s;t of much &s;uperior
Swiftne&s;s. A Man's Time, when well hu&s;banded,
is like a cultivated Field, of which a few Acres pro|duce
more of what is u&s;eful to Life, than exten&s;ive
Provinces, even of the riche&s;t Soil, when over-run
with Weeds and Brambles.</P>
<P>BUT all Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s in Life, or even of
tolerable Sub&s;i&s;tence, mu&s;t fail, where a rea&s;onable
FRUGALITY is wanting. The Heap, in|&s;tead
of encrea&s;ing, dimini&s;hes daily, and leaves its
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;o much more unhappy, that not having
been able to confine his Expences to a larger Reve|nue,
he will &s;till le&s;s be able to live contentedly on a

inflam'd with impure Appetites, and lo&s;ing the Body,
which alone afforded Means of Satisfaction, hover
about the Earth, and haunt the Places, where their

to recover the lo&s;t Organs of Sen&s;ation So may we
&s;ee worthle&s;s Prodigals, having con&s;um'd their For|tunes

THE one Extreme of Frugality is <HI>Avarice,</HI> which,

<P>ALL Men, 'tis allow'd, are equally de&s;irous of
Happine&s;s; but all Men are not equally &s;ucce&s;sful in
the Pur&s;uit: Of which one chief Cau&s;e is the common
Want of STRENGTH of MIND, which
might enable us to re&s;i&s;t the Temptation of pre&s;ent
Ea&s;e or Plea&s;ure, and carry us forward in the Search
of more di&s;tant Profit and Enjoyment. Our Affec|tions,
on a general Pro&s;pect of their Objects, form
certain Rules of Conduct, and certain Mea&s;ures of
Preference of one above another: And the&s;e De|ci&s;ions,
tho' really the Re&s;ult of our calm Pa&s;&s;ions,
and Propen&s;ities, (for what el&s;e can pronounce any
Object eligible or the contrary?) are yet &s;aid, by a
natural Abu&s;e of Terms, to be the Determinations
of pure <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and Reflection. But when &s;ome of
the&s;e Objects approach nearer us, or acquire the Ad|vantages
of favourable Lights and Po&s;itions, which
<PB N="126" REF="129">
catch the Heart or Imagination; our general Re&s;o|lutions
are frequently confounded, a &s;mall Enjoyment
preferr'd, and la&s;ting Shame and Sorrow entail'd
upon us. And however Poets may employ their
Wit and Eloquence, in celebrating pre&s;ent Plea&s;ure,
and rejecting all di&s;tant Views to Fame, Health, or
Fortune; 'tis obvious, that this Practice is the Source
of all Di&s;&s;olutene&s;s and Debauchery, Repentance
and Mi&s;ery. A Man of a &s;trong and determin'd
Temper adheres tenaciou&s;ly to his general Re&s;olu|tions,
and is neither &s;educ'd by the Allurements of
Plea&s;ure, nor terrify'd by the Menaces of Pain;
but keeps &s;till in View tho&s;e di&s;tant Pur&s;uits, by which
he, at once, en&s;ures his Happine&s;s and his Ho|nour.</P>
<P>SELF-SATISFACTION, at lea&s;t in &s;ome Degree, is
an Advantage, that equally attends the FOOL
and the WISE-MAN: But 'tis the only one;
nor is there any other Circum&s;tance in the Conduct
of Life, where they are upon an equal Footing.
Bu&s;ine&s;s, Books, Conver&s;ation; for all of the&s;e, a

in this Particular; and many In&s;tances are
&s;een of Profligacy and Treachery, the mo&s;t avow'd,
<PB N="127" REF="130">

be mo&s;t valuable? Whether one, that,
at fir&s;t View, penetrates far into a Subject, but can
perform nothing upon Study; or a contrary Cha|racter,
which mu&s;t work out every Thing by Dint of
Application? Whether a clear Head or a copious
<PB N="128" REF="131">
Invention? Whether a profound Genius or a &s;ure
Judgment? In &s;hort, what Character, or peculiar
Turn of Under&s;tanding is more excellent than
another? 'Tis evident, we can an&s;wer none of
the&s;e Que&s;tions, without con&s;idering which of tho&s;e
Qualities capacitates a Man be&s;t for the World, and
carries him faithe&s;t in any of his Undertakings.</P>
<P>IF refin'd Sen&s;e and exalted Sen&s;e be not &s;o <HI>u&s;eful</HI>
as common Sen&s;e, their Rarity, their Novelty, and
the Noblene&s;s of their Objects make &s;ome Compen|&s;ation,
and render them the Admiration of Man|kind:
As Gold, tho' le&s;s &s;erviceable than Iron, ac|quires,
from its Scarcity, a Value, which is much
&s;uperior.</P>
<P>THE De&s;ects of Judgment can be &s;upply'd by no
Art or Invention; but tho&s;e of MEMORY fre|quently
may, both in Bu&s;ine&s;s and in Study, by
Method and Indu&s;try, and by Diligence in commit|ting
every Thing to Paper; and we &s;carce ever hear
a &s;hort Memory given as a Rea&s;on for a Man's Want
of Succe&s;s in any Undertaking. But in antient
Times, when no Man could make a Figure without
the Talent of &s;peaking, and when the Audience
were too delicate to bear &s;uch crude, undige&s;ted
Harangues as our extemporary Orators offer to pub|lic
A&s;&s;emblies; the Faculty of Memory was then of
<PB N="129" REF="132">
the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence, and was accordingly much
more valued than at pre&s;ent. Scarce any great
Genius is mention'd in Antiquity, who is not cele|brated
for this Talent; and <HI>Cicero</HI> enumerates it
among&s;t the other &s;ublime Qualities of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> him|&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuit in illo ingenium, ratio, memoria, literae, cura, cogi|tatio, diligentia, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Phillip. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PARTICULAR Cu&s;toms and Manners alter the U&s;e|fulne&s;s
of Qualities: they al&s;o alter their Merit.
Particular Situations and Accidents have, in &s;ome
Degree, the &s;ame Influence. He will always be
more e&s;teem'd, who profe&s;&s;es tho&s;e Talents and Ac|compli&s;hments,
which &s;uit his Station and Pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
than the whom Fortune has mi&s;plac'd in the
Part &s;he has a&s;&s;ign'd him. The private or &s;elfi&s;h
Virtues are, in this re&s;pect, more arbitrary than the
public and &s;ocial. In other re&s;pects, they are, per|haps,
le&s;s liable to Doubt and Controver&s;y.</P>
<P>IN this Kingdom, &s;uch continu'd O&s;tentation, of

any bad Intention, to di&s;cover a &s;ullen Incredulity
on the head of the&s;e moral Endowments, and even
&s;ometimes ab&s;olutely to deny their Exi&s;tence and
Reality. In like Manner, I find, that, of old, the
perpetual Cant of the <HI>Stoics</HI> and <HI>Cynics</HI> concerning
<HI>Virtue,</HI> their magnificent Profe&s;&s;ions and &s;lender Per|formances,
bred a Di&s;gu&s;t in Mankind; and <HI>Lucian,</HI>
who, tho' licentious on the Article of Plea&s;ure, is
yet, in other re&s;pects, a very moral Writer, cannot,
&s;ometimes, talk of Virtue, &s;o much boa&s;ted, with|out
betraying Symptoms of Spleen and Irony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Luc. Timon. Again, <GAP DESC="foreign">. Icuro-men. In another Place, <GAP DESC="foreign">. Deor. Concil.</NOTE>. But
&s;urely, this peevi&s;h Delicacy, whence-ever it ari&s;es,

Avowal of their Merit, there are many others,
to which the mo&s;t determin'd Scepti&s;m cannot, for a

thou&s;and more of the &s;ame Kind, no Man will ever
deny to be Excellencies and Endowments. As their
Merit con&s;i&s;ts in their Tendency to &s;erve the Per&s;on,
po&s;&s;e&s;t of them, without any magnificent Claims of
public and &s;ocial De&s;ert, we are the le&s;s jealous of
their Preten&s;ions, and readily admit them into the
Catalogue of Virtues. We are not &s;en&s;ible, that,
by this Conce&s;&s;ion, we have pav'd the Way for all
the other moral Excellencies, and cannot con&s;i&s;tently
he&s;itate any longer, with regard to di&s;intere&s;ted Be|nevolence,
Patrioti&s;m, and Humanity.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems, indeed, certain, that fir&s;t Appearances
are here, as u&s;ual, extremely deceitful, and that 'tis
more difficult, in a &s;peculative Way, to re&s;olve into
Self-love the Merit we a&s;cribe to the &s;elfi&s;h Virtues
above-mention'd, than that even of the &s;ocial Virtues
of Ju&s;tice and Beneficence. For this latter Purpo&s;e,
we need but &s;ay, that whatever Conduct and Beha|viour
promotes the Good of the Community, is
lov'd, prais'd, and e&s;teem'd by the Community, on
Account of that Utility and Intere&s;t, of which every
one partakes: And tho' this Affection and Regard
be, in Reality, Gratitude, not Self-love, yet a
Di&s;tinction, even of this obvious Nature, may not
<PB N="132" REF="135">
readily be made by &s;uperficial Rea&s;oners; and there
is Room, at lea&s;t, to &s;upport the Cavil and Di&s;pute
for a Moment. But as Qualities, which tend only
to the Utility of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, without any Refer|ence
to us, or to the Community, are yet e&s;teem'd
and valu'd; by what Theory or Sy&s;tem can we ac|count
for this Sentiment from Self-love, or deduce it
from that favourite Origin? There &s;eems here a
Nece&s;&s;ity of confe&s;&s;ing that the Happine&s;s and
Mi&s;ery of others are not Spectacles altogether in|different
to us, but that the View of the former,
whether in its Cau&s;es or Effects, like Sun-&s;hine or
the Pro&s;pect of well-cultivated Plains (to carry our
Preten&s;ions no higher) communicates a &s;ecret Joy
and Satisfaction; the Appearance of the latter,
like a lowering Cloud or barren Land&s;kip, throws a
melancholy Damp over the Imagination. And this
Conce&s;&s;ion being once made, the Difficulty is over;
and a natural, unforc'd Interpretation of the Phae|nomena
of human Life will afterwards, we may
hope, prevail, among&s;t all &s;peculative Enquirers.</P>

<P><PB N="136" REF="139">
A DISPOSITION or Turn of Mind, which quali|fies
a Man to ri&s;e in the World, and advance his
Fortune, is entitled to E&s;teem and Regard, as has
been already explain'd. It may, therefore, naturally
be &s;uppos'd, that the actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Riches and
Authority will have a con&s;iderable Influence over
the&s;e Sentiments.</P>
<P>LET us examine any Hypothe&s;is, by which we can
account for the Regard, pay'd the Rich and Power|ful:
We &s;hall find none &s;atisfactory but that which
derives it from the Enjoyment, communicated by the
Images of Pro&s;perity, Happine&s;s, Ea&s;e, Plenty,
Command, and the Gratification of every Appetite.
Self-love, for In&s;tance, which &s;ome affect &s;o much
to con&s;ider as the Source of every Sentiment, is
<PB N="137" REF="140">
plainly in&s;ufficient to this Purpo&s;e. Where no Good|will
or Friendship appears, 'tis difficult to conceive
on what we can found our Hope of Advantage from
the Riches of others; tho' we naturally e&s;teem and
re&s;pect the Rich, even before they di&s;cover any
&s;uch favourable Di&s;po&s;ition towards us.</P>
<P>WE are affected with the &s;ame Sentiments, when
we lie &s;o much out of the Sphere of their Activity,
that they cannot even be &s;uppos'd to po&s;&s;e&s;s the
Power of &s;erving us. A Pri&s;oner of War, in all
civiliz'd Nations, is treated with a Regard, &s;uited to
his Condition; and Riches, 'tis evident, go far to|wards
fixing the Condition of any Per&s;on. If Birth
and Quality enter for a Share, this &s;till affords us an
Argument to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e. For what is it
we call a Man of Birth, but one, who is de&s;cended
from a long Succe&s;&s;ion of rich and powerful An|ce&s;tors,
and who acquires our E&s;teem by his Con|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">ion
with Per&s;ons, whom we e&s;teem? His An|ce&s;tors,
therefore, tho' dead, are re&s;pected, in &s;ome
Mea&s;ure, on Account of their Riches; and con&s;e|quently,
without any Kind of Expectation.</P>
<P>BUT not to go &s;o far as Pri&s;oners of War or the
Dead, to find In&s;tances of this di&s;intere&s;ted Regard
for Riches; we may only ob&s;erve, with a little At|tention,
tho&s;e Phaenomena, that occur in common
<PB N="138" REF="141">
Life and Conver&s;ation. A Man, who is him&s;elf,
we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, of a competent Fortune, and of
no Profe&s;&s;ion, coming into a Company of Strangers,
naturally treats them with different Degrees of Re&s;|pect
and Deference, as he is inform'd of their dif|ferent
Fortunes and Conditions; tho' 'tis impo&s;&s;ible
he can &s;o &s;uddenly propo&s;e, and perhaps would not
accept of, any pecuniary Advantage from them. A
Traveller is always admitted into Company, and
meets with Civility, in Proportion as his Train and
Equipage &s;peak him a Man of great or moderate
Fortune. In &s;hort, the different Ranks of Man are,
in a great Mea&s;ure, regulated by Riches; and that
with regard to Superiors as well as Inferiors, Strangers
as well as Acquaintance.</P>
<P>WHAT remains, therefore, but to conclude, that
as Riches are de&s;ir'd for our&s;elf only as the Means
of gratifying our Appetites, either at pre&s;ent or in
&s;ome imaginary future Period; they beget E&s;teem
in others merely from their having that Influence.
This indeed is their very Nature or E&s;&s;ence: They
have a direct Reference to the Commodities, Con|veniencies,
and Plea&s;ures of Life: A Banker's Bill,
who is broke, or Gold in a de&s;art I&s;land, would
otherwi&s;e be full as valuable. When we approach a
Man, who is, as we &s;ay, at his Ea&s;e, we are pre|&s;ented
with the plea&s;ing Ideas of Plenty, Satisfaction,
<PB N="139" REF="142">
Cleanline&s;s, Warmth; a chearful Hou&s;e, elegant
Furniture, ready Service, and whatever is de&s;irable
in Meat, Drink, or Apparel. On the contrary,
when a poor Man appears, the di&s;agreeable Images
of Want, Penury, hard Labour, dirty Furniture,
coar&s;e or ragged Cloaths, nau&s;eous Meat and di&s;ta&s;te|ful
Liquor, immediately &s;trike our Fancy. What
el&s;e do we mean by &s;aying the one is rich, the other
poor? And as Regard or Contempt is the natural
Con&s;equence of the&s;e different Situations in Life;
'tis ea&s;ily &s;een what additional Light and Evidence
this throws on our preceding Theory, with Regard
to all moral Di&s;tinctions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is &s;omething very extraordinary, and &s;eemingly un|accountable in the Operation of our Pa&s;&s;ions, when we con&s;ider the Fortune and Situation of others. Very often another's Ad|vancement and Pro&s;perity produces Envy, which has a &s;trong Mix|ture of Hatred, and ari&s;es chiefly from the Compari&s;on of our&s;elves with the Per&s;on. At the very &s;ame Time, or at lea&s;t, in very &s;hort Intervals, we may feel the Pa&s;&s;ion of Re&s;pect, which is a Species of Affection or Good-will, with a Mixture of Humility. On the other hand, the Misfortunes of our Fellows often cau&s;e Pity, which has a &s;trong Mixture of Good-will. This Sentiment of Pity is nearly ally'd to Contempt, which is a Species of Di&s;like, along with a Mixture of Pride. I only point out the&s;e Phaenomena, as a Subject of Speculation to &s;uch as are curious with regard to moral Enquiries. 'Tis &s;ufficient for the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve in general, that Power and Riches commonly cau&s;e Re&s;pect, Po|verty and Meanne&s;s Contempt, tho' particular Views and Incidents may &s;ometimes rai&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ions of Envy and of Pity.</NOTE>.</P>

on the Acce&s;&s;ion of a good-humour'd, lively Com|panion;
&s;uch a one, I &s;ay, will ea&s;ily allow, that
CHEERFULNESS carries great Merit with
it, and naturally conciliates the Affection and Good|will
of Mankind. No Quality, indeed, more rea|dily
communicates it&s;elf to all around; becau&s;e
none has a greater Propen&s;ity to di&s;play it&s;elf, in
jovial Talk and plea&s;ant Entertainment. The Flame
&s;preads thro' the whole Circle; and the mo&s;t &s;ullen

<P>FROM this Influence of Cheerfulne&s;s, both to

which, without any Utility or any Tendency to
farther Good, either of the Community or of the

A certain Degree of generous Pride or Self-value is
&s;o requi&s;ite, that the Ab&s;ence of it in the Mind di&s;|plea&s;es

the predominant Excellence; what is mo&s;t celebrated

<P>OF the &s;ame Cla&s;s of Virtues with Courage is that
undi&s;turb'd, philo&s;ophical TRANQUILLITY,
&s;uperior to Pain, Sorrow, Anxiety, and each A&s;&s;ault
of adver&s;e Fortune. Con&s;cious of his own Virtue,
&s;ay the Philo&s;ophers, the Sage elevates him&s;elf above
every Accident of Life; and &s;ecurely plac'd in the
Temple of Wi&s;dom, looks down on inferior Mor|tals,
engag'd in Pur&s;uit of Honours, Riches, Re|putation,
and each frivolous Enjoyment. The&s;e
Preten&s;ions, no doubt, when &s;tretch'd to the utmo&s;t,
<PB N="153" REF="155">
are much too magnificent for human Nature. They
carry, however, a Grandeur, with them, which
&s;eizes the Spectator, and &s;trikes him with Admira|tion.
And the nearer we can approach, in Practice,
to this &s;ublime Tranquillity and Indifference (for we
mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h it from a &s;tupid In&s;en&s;ibility) the
more &s;ecure Enjoyment &s;hall we attain within our|&s;elves,
and the more Greatne&s;s of Mind &s;hall we
di&s;cover to the World. The philo&s;ophical Tran|quillity
may, indeed, be con&s;ider'd only as a Branch
of Magnanimity.</P>
<P>WHO admires not <HI>Socrates;</HI> his perpetual Serenity
and Contentment, amid&s;t the greate&s;t Poverty and

IN Antiquity, the Heroes of Philo&s;ophy, as well

&s;upernatural. They, in their Turn, I allow, would
have had equal Rea&s;on to con&s;ider, as romantic and

Order, Tranquillity, and other &s;ocial Virtues, to
which, in the Admini&s;tration of Government, we
have attain'd in modern Times, had any one been
then able to have made a fair Repre&s;entation of
them. Such is the Compen&s;ation, which Nature,
or rather Education has made, in the Di&s;tribution of
Excellencies and Virtues, in the&s;e different Ages.</P>
<P>THE Merit of BENEVOLENCE, ari&s;ing from
its Utility, and its Tendency to the Good of Man|kind,
has been already explain'd, and is, no doubt, the
Source of a <HI>con&s;iderable</HI> Part of that E&s;teem, which is
&s;o univer&s;ally pay'd it But it will al&s;o be allow'd, that
the very Softne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s of the Sentiment,
its engaging Endearments, its fond Expre&s;&s;ions, its de|licate
Attentions, and all that Flow of mutual Con|fidence
and Regard, which enter into a warm At|tachment
of Love and Friend&s;hip: It will be al|low'd,
I &s;ay, that the&s;e Feelings being delightful in
them&s;elves, are nece&s;&s;arily communicated to the

Spectators, and melt them into the &s;ame Fondne&s;s

Eyes on the Ob&s;ervation of a warm Sentiment of
this Nature: Our Brea&s;t heaves, our Heart is agitat|ed,
and every humane tender Principle of our Frame,
is &s;et in Motion, and gives us the pure&s;t and mo&s;t
&s;atisfactory Enjoyment.</P>

Image of the&s;e &s;oft and gentle Pa&s;&s;ions. The Idea

As a certain Proof, that the whole Merit of Bene|volence

<P>THE <HI>Athenians</HI> pretended to the fir&s;t Invention of

di&s;playing the warlike Atchievments. <HI>Ly&s;ias, Thucy|dides,

Magnanimity, Courage, Di&s;dain of Fortune; or
tho&s;e of the tender Affections, Love and Friend&s;hip;
which warm the Heart, and diffu&s;e over us &s;imilar
Sentiments and Emotions. And tho' every Kind of
Pa&s;&s;ion, even the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable, &s;uch as Grief
and Anger, are ob&s;erv'd, when excited by Poetry,
to convey a Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction, from a Me|chani&s;m
of Nature, not ea&s;y to be explain'd: Yet
tho&s;e more elevated or &s;ofter Affections have a pecu|liar
Influence, and plea&s;e from more than one Cau&s;e
or Principle. Not to mention, that they alone in|tere&s;t
us in the Fortune of the Per&s;ons repre&s;ented,
or communicate any E&s;teem and Affection for their
Character.</P>
<P>AND can it po&s;&s;ibly be doubted, that this Talent
it&s;elf of Poets, to move the Pa&s;&s;ions, this PA|THETIC
and SUBLIME of Sentiment, is a
very con&s;iderable Merit, and being enhanc'd by its

of Intere&s;t and Self-love have con|&s;train'd
Mankind to e&s;tabli&s;h the Laws of <HI>Ju&s;tice;</HI>
in order to pre&s;erve the Advantages of common A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
and Protection: in like Manner, the eternal
Contrarieties, in <HI>Company,</HI> of Men's Pride and Self-conceit
have introduc'd the Rules of GOOD-MANNERS
or POLITENESS, in order to
facilitate the Intercour&s;e of Minds, and an un|di&s;turb'd
Commerce and Conver&s;ation. Among&s;t
<PB N="162" REF="163">
well-bred People, a mutual Deference is affected;
Contempt of others di&s;guis'd: Authority conceal'd:
Attention given to each in his Turn: And an ea&s;y
Stream of Conver&s;ation maintain'd, without Vehe|mence,
without mutual Interruption, without Eager|ne&s;s
for Victory, and without any Airs of Superio|rity.
The&s;e Attentions and Regards are immediately
<HI>agreeable</HI> to others, ab&s;tracted from any Regard to
Utility or beneficial Tendencies: They conciliate
Affection, promote E&s;teem, and enhance extremely
the Merit of the Per&s;on, who regulates his Behaviour
by them.</P>
<P>MANY of the Forms of Breeding are arbitrary
and ca&s;ual: But the Thing expre&s;t by them is &s;till
the &s;ame. A <HI>Spaniard</HI> goes out of his own Hou&s;e
before his Gue&s;t, to &s;ignify, that he leaves him
Ma&s;ter of all. In other Countries, the Landlord
walks out la&s;t, as a common Mark of Deference and
Regard.</P>
<P>BUT in order to render a Man perfect <HI>Good-company,</HI>
he mu&s;t have WIT and INGENUITY as well as
Good-manners. What Wit is, it may not be ea&s;y to
define; but 'tis ea&s;y &s;urely to determine, that 'tis a
Quality immediately <HI>agreeable</HI> to others, and com|municating,
on its fir&s;t Appearance, a lively Joy and
Satisfaction to every one, that has any Comprehen|&s;ion
<PB N="163" REF="164">
of it. The mo&s;t profound Metaphy&s;ics, indeed,
might be employ'd, in explaining the various Kinds
and Species of Wit; and many Cla&s;&s;es of it, which
are now receiv'd on the &s;imple Te&s;timony of Ta&s;te
and Sentiment, might, perhaps, be re&s;olv'd into
more general Principles. But this is &s;ufficient for
our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, that it does affect Ta&s;te and
Sentiment, and be&s;towing an immediate Enjoyment,
is a &s;ure Source of Approbation and Affection.</P>
<P>IN Countries, where Men pa&s;s all their Time in
Conver&s;ation, and Vi&s;its and A&s;&s;emblies, the&s;e <HI>compa|nionable</HI>
Qualities, &s;o to &s;peak, are of high E&s;tima|tion,
and form a chief Part of per&s;onal Merit. In
Countries, where Men live a more dome&s;tic Life,
and either are employ'd in Bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;e them|&s;elves
in a narrower Circle of Acquaintance, the
more &s;olid Qualities are chiefly regarded. Thus, I
have ob&s;erv'd, that, among&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> the fir&s;t
Que&s;tions, with regard to a Stranger, are, <HI>Is he
polite? Has he Wit?</HI> In our own Country, the
chief Prai&s;e be&s;tow'd is always that of a <HI>good-natur'd,
&s;en&s;ible Fellow.</HI></P>
<P>IN Conver&s;ation, the lively Spirit of Dialogue is
<HI>agreeable,</HI> even to tho&s;e who de&s;ire not to have any
Share of the Di&s;cour&s;e: Hence a Teller of long
Stories or a pompous Declaimer is very little approv'd
<PB N="164" REF="165">
of. But mo&s;t Men de&s;ire likewi&s;e their Share in the
Conver&s;ation, and regard, with a very evil Eye,
that <HI>Loquacity,</HI> which deprives them of a Right they
are naturally &s;o jealous of.</P>
<P>THERE are a Set of harmle&s;s <HI>Lyars,</HI> frequently to
be met with in Company, who deal much in the Mar|velous
and Extraordinary. Their u&s;ual Intention is to
plea&s;e and entertain; but as Men are delighted with
nothing but what they conceive to be Truth, the&s;e
People mi&s;take extremely the Means of plea&s;ing,
and incur univer&s;al Blame. Some Indulgence, how|ever,
to Lying or Fiction is given in <HI>humourous</HI>
Stories; becau&s;e it is there agreeable and enter|taining;
and Truth is not of any Importance.</P>
<P>ELOQUENCE, Genius of all Kinds, even good
Sen&s;e, and &s;ound Rea&s;oning, when it ri&s;es to an
eminent Degree, and is employ'd upon Subjects of
any con&s;iderable Dignity and nice Di&s;cernment;
all the&s;e Qualities &s;eem immediately agreeable, and
have a Merit di&s;tinct from their U&s;efulne&s;s. Rarity,
likewi&s;e, which &s;o much enhances the Price of every
Thing, mu&s;t &s;et an additional Value on the&s;e noble
Talents of the human Mind.</P>
<P>MODESTY may be under&s;tood in different
Sen&s;es, even ab&s;tracted from Cha&s;tity, which has
<PB N="165" REF="166">
been already treated of. It &s;ometimes means that
Tenderne&s;s and Nicety of Honour, that Apprehen|&s;ion
of Blame, that Dread of Intru&s;ion or Injury to|wards
others, that <HI>Pudor,</HI> which is the proper Guar|dian
of every Kind of Virtue, and a &s;ure Pre&s;erva|tive
again&s;t Vice and Corruption. But its mo&s;t u&s;ual
Meaning is, when it is oppos'd to <HI>Impudence</HI> and <HI>Ar|rogance,</HI>
and expre&s;&s;es a Diffidence of our own Judg|ment,
and a due Attention and Regard to others.
In young Men chiefly, this Quality is a &s;ure Sign of
Good-&s;en&s;e; and is al&s;o the certain Means of aug|menting
that Endowment, by pre&s;erving their Ears
open to In&s;truction, and making them &s;till gra&s;p after
new Attainments. But it has a farther Charm to
every Spectator; by flattering each Man's Vanity,
and pre&s;enting the Appearance of a docile Pupil,
who receives, with proper Attention and Re&s;pect,
every Word they utter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Men have in general a much greater Propen&s;ity to over-value than under-value them&s;elves; notwith&s;tanding the Opinion of <HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI> This makes us more jealous of the Exce&s;s on the former Side, and cau&s;es us to regard, with a particular Indulgence, all Tendency to Mode&s;ty and Self-diffidence; as e&s;teeming the Danger le&s;s of falling into any vicious Extreme of that Nature. 'Tis thus, in Countries, where Men's Bodies are apt to exceed in Corpulency, per&s;onal Beauty is plac'd in a much greater Degree of Slenderne&s;s, than in Countries where that is the mo&s;t u&s;ual Defect. Being &s;o often &s;truck with In&s;tances of one Species of Deformity, Men think they can never keep at too great a Di&s;tance from it, and wi&s;h always to have a Leaning to the oppo&s;ite Side. In like Manner, were the Door open'd to Self-prai&s;e, and were <HI>Montaigne</HI>'s Maxim ob&s;erv'd, that one &s;hould &s;ay as frankly, <HI>I have Sen&s;e, I have Learning, I have Courage, Beauty, or Wit;</HI> as 'tis &s;ure we often think &s;o; were this the Ca&s;e, I &s;ay, every one is &s;en&s;ible, that &s;uch a Flood of Impertinence would break in upon us as would render Society altogether intolerable. For this Rea&s;on Cu&s;tom has e&s;tabli&s;h'd it as a Rule, in common Societies, that Men &s;hould never prai&s;e them&s;elves, and not even &s;peak much of them&s;elves; and 'tis only among&s;t intimate Friends or People of very manly Behaviour, that one is allow'd to do him&s;elf Ju&s;tice. No body finds fault with <HI>Maurice,</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> for his Reply to one, who a&s;k'd him whom he e&s;teem'd the fir&s;t General of the Age, <HI>The Marquis de</HI> Spinola, &s;aid he, <HI>is the &s;econd.</HI> Tho' 'tis even ob&s;ervable, that the Self-prai&s;e imply'd is here better imply'd, than if it had been directly expre&s;s'd, without any Cover or Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t be a very &s;uperficial Thinker, who imagines, that all In&s;tances of mutual Deference are to be under&s;tood in earne&s;t, and that a Man would be more e&s;teemable for being ignorant of his own Merits and Accompli&s;hments. A &s;mall Bya&s;s towards Mode&s;ty, even in the internal Sentiments, is favourably regarded, e&s;pecially in young People; and a &s;trong Bya&s;s is requir'd in the outward Behaviour: But this excludes not a noble Pride and Spirit, which may openly di&s;play it&s;elf in its full Extent, when one lies under Calumny or Oppre&s;&s;ion of any Kind. The gene|rous Contumacy of <HI>Socrates,</HI> as <HI>Cicero</HI> calls it, has been highly celebrated in all Ages; and when join'd to the u&s;ual Mode&s;ty of his Behaviour, forms a mo&s;t &s;hining Character. <HI>Iphicrates,</HI> the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">benian</HI> General, being accus'd of betraying the Intere&s;ts of his Country, a&s;k'd his Accu&s;er, <HI>Would you,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>on a like Occa&s;ion, have been guilty of that Crime? By no Means,</HI> reply'd the other. <HI>And can you then imagine,</HI> cry'd the Hero, <HI>that</HI> Iphicrates <HI>would be guilty?</HI> Quinctil. Lib. 5. Cap. 12.

In ordinary Characters, we approve of a Bya&s;s to Mode&s;ty, which is immediately agreeable to others. The vic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ous Exce&s;s of the former Virtue, <HI>viz.</HI> In&s;olence or Haughti|ne&s;s, is immediately di&s;agreeable to others: The Exce&s;s of the latter is &s;o to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.

<P><PB N="166" REF="167">
A DESIRE of Fame, Reputation, or a Character
with others, is &s;o far from being blameable, that it
<PB N="167" REF="168">
&s;eems in&s;eparable from Virtue, Genius, Capacity,
and a generous or noble Di&s;po&s;ition. An Attention,
even to trivial Matters, in order to plea&s;e, is al&s;o

&s;uch an importunate and open Demand of Prai&s;e and

Things, that were &s;aid to you; the Honours, the
Di&s;tinctions you met with; as if the&s;e were not
Things of Cour&s;e, and what we could readily, of
our&s;elves, have imagin'd, without being told of
them?</P>
<P>DECENCY, or a proper Regard to Age, Sex,
Character and Station in the World, may be rank'd
among the Qualities, which are immediately agree|able
to others, and which, by that Means, acquire
Prai&s;e and Approbation. An effeminate Behaviour
in a Man, a rough Manner in a Woman; the&s;e are
ugly, becau&s;e un&s;uitable to each Character, and
different from the Qualities we expect in the Sexes.
'Tis as if a Tragedy abounded in comic Beauties,
or a Comedy in tragic. The Di&s;proportions hurt the
Eye, and convey a di&s;agreeable Sentiment to the
Spectators, the Source of Blame and Di&s;approba|tion.
This is that <HI>Indecorum,</HI> which is explain'd &s;o
much at large by <HI>Cicero</HI> in his Offices.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="170">
AMONGST the other Virtues, we may al&s;o give
CLEANLINESS a Place; &s;ince it naturally
renders us agreeable to others, and is no incon&s;ider|able
Source of Love and Affection. No one will
deny, that a Negligence in this Particular is a Fault;
and as Faults are nothing but &s;maller Vices, and this
Fault can have no other Origin than the unea&s;y Sen|&s;ation,
which it excites in others; we may, in this
In&s;tance, &s;eemingly &s;o trivial, clearly di&s;cover the
Origin of moral Di&s;tinctions, about which the
Learned have involved them&s;elves in &s;uch Mazes of
Perplexity and Error.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides all the <HI>agreeable</HI> Qualities, the Origin
of who&s;e Beauty we can, in &s;ome Degree, explain
and account for, there &s;till remains &s;omething my&s;te|rious
and unaccountable, which conveys an imme|diate
Satisfaction to the Spectators, but how, or
why, or for what Rea&s;on, they cannot pretend to
determine. There is a MANNER, a Grace, a
Genteelne&s;s, an I-know-not-what, which &s;ome Men
po&s;&s;e&s;s above others, which is very different from ex|ternal
Beauty and Comeline&s;s, and which, however,
catches our Affection almo&s;t as &s;uddenly and power|fully.
And tho' this <HI>Manner</HI> be chiefly talk'd of in
the Pa&s;&s;ion betwixt the Sexes, where the conceal'd
Magic is ea&s;ily explain'd, yet &s;urely much of it pre|vails
<PB N="170" REF="171">
in all our E&s;timation of Characters, and forms
no incon&s;iderable Part of per&s;onal Merit. This Cla&s;s
of Virtues, therefore, mu&s;t be tru&s;ted entirely to the
blind, but &s;ure Te&s;timony of Ta&s;te and Sentiment;
and mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd as a Part of Ethics, left by
Nature to baffle all the Pride of Philo&s;ophy, and
make her &s;en&s;ible of her narrow Boundaries and

<P>WE approve of another, becau&s;e of his Wit, Po|litene&s;s,

he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, although he be not of our Acquain|tance,
nor has ever given us any Entertainment, by
Means of the&s;e Accompli&s;hments. The Idea, which
we form of their Effect on his Acquaintance, has an
agreeable Influence on our Imagination, and gives us
the Sentiment of Approbation. This Principle enters

<P>IT may ju&s;tly appear &s;urprizing, that any Man,
in &s;o late an Age, &s;hould find it requi&s;ite to
prove, by elaborate Rea&s;onings, that VIRTUE

<HI>Per&s;on him&s;elf</HI> or to <HI>others.</HI> It might be expected
that this Principle would have occur'd even to the
fir&s;t rude, unpractis'd Enquirers concerning Morals,
and been receiv'd, from its own Evidence, without
any Argument or Di&s;putation. Whatever is valuable
in any Kind &s;o naturally cla&s;&s;es it&s;elf under the Di|vi&s;ion
of <HI>u&s;eful</HI> or <HI>agreeable,</HI> the <HI>utile</HI> or the <HI>dulce,</HI>
that 'tis not ea&s;y to imagine, why we &s;hould ever
&s;eek farther, or con&s;ider the Que&s;tion as a Matter of
nice Re&s;earch or Enquiry. And as every Thing

u&s;eful or agreeable mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e Qualities with
regard either to the <HI>Per&s;on him&s;elf</HI> or to <HI>others,</HI> the
compleat Delineation or De&s;cription of Merit &s;eems
to be perform'd as naturally as a Shadow is ca&s;t by
the Sun, or an Image is reflected upon Water. If
the Ground, on which the Shadow is ca&s;t, be not
broken and uneven, nor the Surface, from which
the Image is reflected, di&s;turb'd and confus'd, a ju&s;t
Figure is immediately pre&s;ented, without any Art

that Sy&s;tems and Hypothe&s;es have perverted
our natural Under&s;tanding, when a Theory, &s;o
&s;imple and obvious, could &s;o long have e&s;cap'd the

<P>BUT however the Ca&s;e may have far'd with Phi|lo&s;ophy;
in common Life, the&s;e Principles are &s;till
implicitely maintain'd; nor is any other Topic of
Prai&s;e or Blame ever recur'd to, when we employ

I met him lately in a Circle of the gaye&s;t

out by Company: It runs thro' the whole Tenor of
his Life, and pre&s;erves a perpetual Serenity on his
Countenance, and Tranquillity in his Soul. He has
met with &s;evere Trials, Misfortunes as well as

under the Denomination of Virtue or per&s;onal
Merit; &s;o no other will ever be receiv'd, where
Men judge of Things by their natural, unprejudic'd
Rea&s;on, without the delu&s;ive Glo&s;&s;es of Super&s;tition
and fal&s;e Religion. Celibacy, Fa&s;ting, Penances,
Mortification, Self-denial, Humility, Silence, So|litude
and the whole Train of monki&s;h Virtues;
for what Rea&s;on are they every where rejected by
Men of Sen&s;e, but becau&s;e they &s;erve no Manner of
Purpo&s;e; neither advance a Man's Fortune in the
World, nor render him a more valuable Member of
Society; neither qualify him for the Entertainment
of Company, nor encrea&s;e his Power of Self-en|joyment?
We ob&s;erve, on the contrary, that they

and &s;ower the Temper. We ju&s;tly, therefore trans|fer
them to the oppo&s;ite Column, and place them in
the Catalogue of Vices; nor has any Super&s;tition
Force &s;ufficient, among&s;t Men of the World, to
pervert entirely the&s;e natural Sentiments. A gloomy,
hair-brain'd Enthu&s;ia&s;t, after his Death, may have

when alive, into Intimacy and Society, ex|cept
by tho&s;e who are as delirious and di&s;mal as

<P>IT &s;eems a Happine&s;s in the pre&s;ent Theory, that
it enters not into that vulgar Di&s;pute concerning the
<HI>Degrees</HI> of Benevolence or Self-love, which prevail
in human Nature; a Di&s;pute, which is never likely
to have any I&s;&s;ue, both becau&s;e Men, who have
taken Party, are not ea&s;ily convinc'd, and becau&s;e
the Phaenomena, which can be produc'd on either
Side, are &s;o di&s;pers'd, &s;o uncertain, and &s;ubject to &s;o
many Interpretations, that 'tis &s;carce po&s;&s;ible accu|rately
to compare them, or draw from them any de|terminate
Inference or Conclu&s;ion. 'Tis &s;ufficient
for our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, if it be allow'd, what &s;urely,
without the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdity, cannot be di&s;puted,
that there is &s;ome Benevolence, however &s;mall, in|fus'd
into our Bo&s;om; &s;ome Spark of Friend&s;hip for
human Kind; &s;ome Particle of the Dove, kneaded
into our Frame, along with the Elements of the
<PB N="176" REF="177">
Wolf and Serpent. Let the&s;e generous Sentiments
be &s;uppos'd ever &s;o weak; let them be hardly &s;uf|ficient
to move even a Hand or Finger of our Body;
they mu&s;t &s;till direct the Determinations of our Mind,
and where every Thing el&s;e is equal, produce a cool
Preference of what is u&s;eful and &s;erviceable to Man|kind,
above what is pernicious and dangerous. A
<HI>moral Di&s;tinction,</HI> therefore, immediately ari&s;es; a
general Sentiment of Blame and Approbation; a
Tendency, however faint, to the Objects of the one,
and a proportionable Aver&s;ion to tho&s;e of the other.
Nor will tho&s;e Rea&s;oners, who &s;o earne&s;tly maintain
the predominant Selfi&s;hne&s;s of human Kind, be any
way &s;candaliz'd at hearing of the weak Sentiments
of Virtue, implanted in our Nature. On the con|trary,
they are found as ready to maintain the one
Tenet as the other; and their Spirit of Satyre, (for

<P>AVARICE, Ambition, Vanity, and all Pa&s;&s;ions,
vulgarly, tho' improperly, compriz'd under the De|nomination
of <HI>Self-love,</HI> are here excluded from our
Theory concerning the Origin of Morals, not be|cau&s;e
they are too weak, but becau&s;e they have not
a proper Direction, for that Purpo&s;e. The Notion
of Morals implies &s;ome Sentiment, common to all
<PB N="177" REF="178">
Mankind, which recommends the &s;ame Object to
general Approbation, and makes every Man, or
mo&s;t Men, agree in the &s;ame Opinion or Deci&s;ion
concerning it. It al&s;o implies &s;ome Sentiment, &s;o
univer&s;al and comprehen&s;ive as to extend to all Man|kind,
and render the Actions and Conduct, even of
Per&s;ons the mo&s;t remote, an Object of Cen&s;ure or
Applau&s;e, according as they agree or di&s;agree with
that Rule of Right, which is e&s;tabli&s;h'd. The&s;e two
requi&s;ite Circum&s;tances belong alone to the Senti|ment
of Humanity here in&s;i&s;ted on. The other
Pa&s;&s;ions produce, in every Brea&s;t, many &s;trong Sen|timents
of De&s;ire and Aver&s;ion, Affection and
Hatred; but the&s;e neither are felt &s;o much in com|mon,
nor are &s;o comprehen&s;ive, as to be the Foun|dation
of any general Sy&s;tem and e&s;tabli&s;h'd Theory
of Blame or Approbation.</P>
<P>WHEN a Man denominates another his <HI>Enemy,</HI> his
<HI>Rival,</HI> his <HI>Antagoni&s;t,</HI> his <HI>Adver&s;ary,</HI> he is under&s;tood
to &s;peak the Language of Self-love, and to expre&s;s
Sentiments, peculiar to him&s;elf, and ari&s;ing from his
particular Circum&s;tances and Situation: But when
he be&s;tows on any Man the Epithets of <HI>vicious</HI> or
<HI>odious</HI> or <HI>deprav'd,</HI> he then &s;peaks another Language,
and expre&s;&s;es Sentiments, in which he expects all his
Audience are to concur with him. He mu&s;t here,
therefore, depart from his private and particular
<PB N="178" REF="179">
Situation, and mu&s;t choo&s;e a Point of View, com|mon
to him with others: He mu&s;t move &s;ome uni|ver&s;al
Principle of the human Frame, and touch a
String, to which all Mankind have an Accord and
Symphony. If he means, therefore, to expre&s;s,
that this Man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es Qualities, who&s;e Tendency is
pernicious to Society, he has cho&s;en this common
Point in View, and has touch'd the Principle of Hu|manity,
in which every Man, in &s;ome Degree,
concurs. While the human Heart is compounded of
the &s;ame Elements as at pre&s;ent, it will never be al|together
indifferent to the Good of Mankind, nor
entirely unaffected with the Tendencies of Characters
and Manners. And tho' this Affection of Humanity
may not generally be e&s;teem'd &s;o &s;trong, as Ambition
or Vanity, yet, being common to all Men, it can
alone be the Foundation of Morals, or of any ge|neral
Sy&s;tem of Conduct and Behaviour. One Man's
Ambition is not another's Ambition; nor will the
&s;ame Event or Object &s;atisfy both: But the Huma|nity
of one Man is the Humanity of every one; and
the &s;ame Object touches this Pa&s;&s;ion in all human
Creatures.</P>
<P>BUT the Sentiments, which ari&s;es from Humanity,
are not only the &s;ame in all human Creatures, and
produce the &s;ame Approbation or Cen&s;ure; but they
al&s;o comprehend all human Creatures; nor is there
<PB N="179" REF="180">
any one, who&s;e Conduct and Character is not, by
their Means, an Object, to every one, of Cen&s;ure
or Approbation. On the contrary tho&s;e other Pa&s;|&s;ions,
commonly denominated &s;elfi&s;h, both produce
different Sentiments in each Individual, according to
his particular Situation; and al&s;o contemplate the
greate&s;t Part of Mankind with the utmo&s;t Indiffe|rence
and Unconcern. Whoever has a high Regard
and E&s;teem for me flatters my Vanity; whoever
expre&s;&s;es Contempt mortifies and di&s;plea&s;es me: But
as my Name is known but to a &s;mall Part of Man|kind,
there are few, that come within the Sphere of
this Pa&s;&s;ion, or excite, on its Account, either my
Affection or Di&s;gu&s;t. But if you repre&s;ent a tyran|nical,
in&s;olent, or barbarous Behaviour, in any
Country or in any Age of the World; I &s;oon carry
my Eye to the pernicious Tendency of &s;uch a Con|duct,
and feel the Sentiments of Repugnance and
Di&s;plea&s;ure towards it. No Character can be &s;o re|mote
as to be, in this Light, altogether indifferent
to me. What is beneficial to Society or to the
Per&s;on him&s;elf mu&s;t &s;till be prefer'd. And every
Quality or Action, of every human Being, mu&s;t,
by this Means, be rank'd under &s;ome Cla&s;s or
Denomination, expre&s;&s;ive of general Cen&s;ure or
Applau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="181">

Sentiments of Cen&s;ure or Approbation, which
ari&s;e from Humanity or from Views of general U&s;e|fulne&s;s
and its contrary. VIRTUE and VICE

Behaviour: Such Mea&s;ures are expected from Men,
in &s;uch Situations: This Action is determin'd con|formable
<PB N="181" REF="182">
to our ab&s;tract Rule; that other, contrary.
And by &s;uch univer&s;al Principles are the particular
Sentiments of Self-love frequently controul'd and
limited<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;eems certain, both from Rea&s;on and Experience, that a rude, untaught Savage regulates chiefly his Love and Hatred by the Ideas of private Utility and Injury, and has but faint Conceptions of a general Rule or Sy&s;tem of Behaviour. The Man, who &s;tands oppo&s;ite to him in Battle, he hates heartily, not only for the pre|&s;ent Moment, which is almo&s;t unavoidable, but for ever after; not is he &s;atisfy'd without the mo&s;t extreme Puni&s;hment and Vengeance. But we, accu&s;tom'd to Society and to more enlarg'd Reflections, con&s;ider, that this Man is &s;erving his own Country and Community; that any Man, in the &s;ame Situation, would do the &s;ame; that we our&s;elves, in like Circum&s;tances, ob&s;erve a like Conduct; that in general human Society is be&s;t &s;upported on &s;uch Maxims: And by the&s;e Suppo&s;itions and Views, we correct, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, our ruder and narrower Pa&s;&s;ions. And tho' much of our Friend&s;hip and Enmity be &s;till regulated by private Con&s;iderations of Benefit and Harm, we pay, at lea&s;t, this Homage to general Rules, which we are accu&s;tom'd to re&s;pect, that we commonly pervert our Adver&s;ary's Conduct, by imputing Malice or Inju&s;tice to him, in order to give Vent to tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, which ari&s;e from Self-love and private In|tere&s;t. When the Heart is full of Rage, it never wants Pretexts of this Nature; tho' &s;ometimes as frivolous, as tho&s;e, from which <HI>Horace,</HI> being almo&s;t cru&s;h'd by the Fall of a Tree, affects to ac|cu&s;e of Parricide the fir&s;t Planter of it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM In&s;tances of popular Tumults, Seditions,
Factions, Panics, and all Pa&s;&s;ions, which are &s;har'd
with a Multitude; we may learn the Influence of
Society, in exciting and &s;upporting any Emotion;
<PB N="182" REF="183">
while the mo&s;t ungovernable Di&s;orders are rais'd,
we find, by that Means, from the &s;lighte&s;t and mo&s;t
frivolous Occa&s;ions. <HI>Solon</HI> was no very cruel, tho',
perhaps, an unju&s;t Legi&s;lator, who puni&s;h'd Neuters
in civil Wars; and few, I believe, would, in &s;uch
Ca&s;es, incur the Penalty, were their Affection and
Di&s;cour&s;e allow'd &s;ufficient to ab&s;olve them. No
Selfi&s;hne&s;s, and &s;carce any Philo&s;ophy, has there
Force &s;ufficient to &s;upport a total Coolne&s;s and Indif|ference;
and he mu&s;t be more or le&s;s than Man,
who kindles not in the common Blaze. What Won|der,
then, that moral Sentiments are found of &s;uch
Influence in Life; tho' &s;pringing from Principles,
which may appear, at fir&s;t Sight, &s;omewhat &s;mall
and delicate? But the&s;e Principles, we mu&s;t remark,
are &s;ocial and univer&s;al: They form, in a Manner,
the <HI>Party</HI> of Human-kind again&s;t Vice or Di&s;order,
its common Enemy: And as the benevolent Concern
for others is diffus'd, in a greater or le&s;s Degree,
over all Men, and is the &s;ame in all, it occurs more
frequently in Di&s;cour&s;e, is fo&s;ter'd by Society and
Conver&s;ation, and the Blame and Approbation,
con&s;equent on it, are thereby rouz'd from that Le|thargy,
into which they are probably lull'd, in &s;o|litary
and uncultivated Nature. Other Pa&s;&s;ions, tho'
perhaps originally &s;tronger, yet being &s;elfi&s;h and
private, are often over-power'd by its Force, and
<PB N="183" REF="184">
yield the Dominion of our Brea&s;t to tho&s;e &s;ocial and
public Principles.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Spring of our Con&s;titution, that brings
great Addition of Force to moral Sentiment, is, the
Love of Fame; which rules, with &s;uch uncontrol'd
Authority, in all generous Minds, and is often the
grand Object of all their De&s;igns and Undertakings.
By our continual and earne&s;t Pur&s;uit of a Character,
a Name, a Reputation in the World, we bring our
own Deportment and Conduct frequently in Review,
and con&s;ider how they appear in the Eyes of tho&s;e,
who approach and regard us. This con&s;tant Habit
of &s;urveying our&s;elf, as it were, in Reflexion, keeps
alive all the Sentiments of Right and Wrong, and
begets, in noble Natures, a certain Reverence for
them&s;elves as well as others; which is the &s;ure&s;t
Guardian of every Virtue. The animal Conve|niencies
and Plea&s;ures &s;ink gradually in their Value;
while every inward Beauty and moral Grace is &s;tudi|ou&s;ly
acquir'd, and the Mind is accompli&s;h'd in each
Perfection, that can adorn or embelli&s;h a rational
Creature.</P>
<P>HERE is the mo&s;t perfect Morality we are ac|quainted
with: Here is di&s;play'd the Force of many
Sympathies. Our moral Sentiment is it&s;elf a Feeling
chiefly of that Nature: And our Regard to a Cha|racter
<PB N="184" REF="185">
with others &s;eems to ari&s;e only from a Care of
pre&s;erving a Character with our&s;elves, in order to
which we find it nece&s;&s;ary to prop our tottering
Judgment on the corre&s;pondent Approbation of
Mankind.</P>
<P>BUT in order to accommodate Matters, and re|move,
if po&s;&s;ible, every Difficulty, let us allow all
the&s;e Rea&s;onings to be fal&s;e. Let us allow, that
when we re&s;olve the Plea&s;ure, that ari&s;es from Views
of Utility, into the Sentiments of Humanity and
Sympathy, we have embrac'd a wrong Hypothe&s;is.
Let us confe&s;s it nece&s;&s;ary to find &s;ome other Expli|cation
of that Applau&s;e, which is paid to all Ob|jects,
whether inanimate, animate or rational, if
they have a Tendency to promote the Welfare and
Advantage of others. However difficult it be to
conceive, that an Object is approv'd of, on Account
of its Tendency to a certain End, while the End
it&s;elf is totally indifferent; let us &s;wallow this Ab|&s;urdity,
and con&s;ider what are the Con&s;equences.
The preceding Delineation or Definition of VIRTUE
mu&s;t &s;till retain its Evidence and Authority: It mu&s;t
&s;till be allow'd, that every Quality of the Mind,
which is <HI>u&s;eful</HI> or <HI>agreeable</HI> to the <HI>Per&s;on him&s;elf</HI> or to
<HI>others,</HI> communicates a Plea&s;ure to the Spectator,
engages his E&s;teem, and is admitted under the ho|nourable
Denomination of Virtue or Merit. Are
<PB N="185" REF="186">
not Ju&s;tice, Fidelity, Honour, Veracity, Allegiance,
Cha&s;tity e&s;teem'd &s;olely on Account of their Ten|dency
to promote the Good of Society? Is not that
Tendency in&s;eperable from Humanity, Benevolence,
Lenity, Genero&s;ity, Gratitude, Moderation, Ten|derne&s;s,
Friend&s;hip, and all the other &s;ocial Vir|tues?
Can it po&s;&s;ibly be doubted, that Indu&s;try,
Di&s;cretion, Frugality, Secrecy, Order, Per&s;everance,
Forethought, Judgment, and that whole Cla&s;s of
Virtues, of which many Pages would not contain
the Catalogue; can it be be doubted, I &s;ay, that
the Tendency of the&s;e Virtues to promote the In|tere&s;t
and Happine&s;s of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or is the &s;ole
Foundation of their Merit? Who can di&s;pute that
a Mind, which &s;upports a perpetual Serenity and
Cheerfulne&s;s, a noble Dignity and undaunted Spirit,
a tender Affection and Good-will to all around; as
it has more Enjoyment within it&s;elf, is al&s;o a
more animating and rejoicing Spectacle, than if de|jected
with Melancholy, tormented with Anxiety,
irritated with Rage, or &s;unk into the mo&s;t abject
Ba&s;ene&s;s and Degeneracy? And as to the Qualities,
immediately <HI>agreeable to others,</HI> they &s;peak &s;ufficiently
for them&s;elves; and he mu&s;t be unhappy, indeed,
either in his own Temper, or in his Situation and
Circum&s;tances, who has never perceiv'd the Charms
of a facetious Wit or flowing Affability, of a delicate
<PB N="186" REF="187">
Mode&s;ty or decent Genteelne&s;s of Addre&s;s and Man|ner.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible, that nothing can be more unphilo|&s;ophical
than to be po&s;itive or dogmatical on any
Subject; and that, even if <HI>exce&s;&s;ive</HI> Sceptici&s;m could
be maintain'd, it would not be more de&s;tructive to
all ju&s;t Rea&s;oning and Enquiry. I am convinc'd,
that, where Men are the mu&s;t &s;ure and arrogant, they
are commonly the mo&s;t mi&s;taken, and have there
given Reins to Pa&s;&s;ion, without that proper Delibera|tion
and Su&s;pence, which can alone &s;ecure them from
the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Ab&s;urdities. Yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that
this Enumeration puts the Matter in &s;o &s;trong a
Light, that I cannot, <HI>at pre&s;ent,</HI> be more a&s;&s;ur'd of
any Truth, which I learn from Rea&s;oning and Ar|gument,
than that Virtue con&s;i&s;ts altogether in the
U&s;efulne&s;s or Agreeablene&s;s of Qualities to the
Per&s;on him&s;elf, po&s;&s;e&s;t of them, or to others, who
have any Intercour&s;e with him. But when I reflect,
that, tho' the Bulk and Figure of the Earth have
been mea&s;ur'd and delineated, tho' the Motions of the
Tides have been accounted for, the Order and
Oeconomy of the heavenly Bodies &s;ubjected to their
proper Laws, and INFINITE it&s;elf reduc'd to
Calculation; yet Men &s;till di&s;pute concerning the
Foundation of their moral Duties: When I reflect
on this, I &s;ay, I fall back into Diffidence and Scep|tici&s;m,
<PB N="187" REF="188">
and &s;u&s;pect, that an Hypothe&s;is, &s;o obvious&punc;
had it been a true one, would, long 'ere now, have
been receiv'd, by the unanimous Suffrage and Con|&s;ent
of Mankind.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>THERE remains nothing, but to con&s;ider
briefly our <HI>Obligation</HI> to Virtue, and to en|quire,
whether every Man, who has any Regard to
his own Happine&s;s and Welfare, will not be&s;t find
his Account in the Practice of every moral Duty. If
this can be clearly a&s;certain'd from the foregoing
Theory, we &s;hall have the Satisfaction to reflect,
that we have advanc'd Principles, which not only,
'tis hop'd, will &s;tand the Te&s;t of Rea&s;oning and
Enquiry, but may contribute to the Amendment of
Men's Lives, and their Improvement in Morality
and &s;ocial Virtue. And tho' the philo&s;ophical Truth
of any Propo&s;ition by no Means depends on its
Tendency to promote the Intere&s;t of Society; yet a
Man has but a bad Grace, who delivers a Theory,
however true, which, he mu&s;t confe&s;s, leads to a
Practice, dangerous and pernicious. Why rake into
tho&s;e Corners of Nature, which &s;pread a Nui&s;ance
all around? Why dig up the Pe&s;tilence from the
Pit, in which it is bury'd? The Ingenuity of your
<PB N="188" REF="189">
Re&s;earches may be admir'd; but your Sy&s;tems will
be dete&s;ted: And Mankind will agree, if they can|not
refute them, to &s;ink them, at lea&s;t, in eternal
Silence and Oblivion: Truths, which are <HI>pernicious</HI>
to Society, if any &s;uch there be, will yield to Errors,
which are &s;alutary and <HI>advantageous.</HI></P>
<P>BUT what philo&s;ophical Truths can be more ad|vantageous
to Society, than tho&s;e here deliver'd,
which repre&s;ent Virtue in all her genuine and mo&s;t
engaging Charms, and make us approach her with
Ea&s;e, Familiarity and Affection? The di&s;mal Dre&s;s
falls off, with which many Divines, and &s;ome Philo|&s;ophers
had cover'd her; and nothing appears but
Gentlene&s;s, Humanity, Beneficence, Affability; nay
even, at proper Intervals, Play, Frolic, and Gaiety.
She talks not of u&s;ele&s;s Au&s;terities and Rigors, Suf|ferance
and Self-denial. She declares, that her &s;ole
Purpo&s;e is, to make her Votaries and all Mankind,
during every In&s;tant of their Exi&s;tence, if po&s;&s;ible,
cheerful and happy; nor does &s;he ever willingly part
with any Plea&s;ure but in Hopes of ample Compen|&s;ation
in &s;ome other Period of their Lives. The &s;ole
Trouble &s;he demands is that of ju&s;t Calculation, and
a &s;teady Preference of the greater Happine&s;s. And
if any au&s;tere Pretenders approach her, Enemies to
Joy and Plea&s;ure, &s;he either rejects them as Hypo|crites
and Deceivers, or if &s;he admits them in her
<PB N="189" REF="190">
Train, they are rank'd, however, among the lea&s;t
favour'd of her Votaries.</P>
<P>AND indeed, to drop all figurative Expre&s;&s;ion,
what Hopes can we ever have of engaging Mankind
to a Practice, which we confe&s;s full of Au&s;terity and
Rigour? Or what Morality can ever &s;erve any u&s;e|ful
Purpo&s;e, unle&s;s it can &s;how, by a particular Detail,
that all the Duties it recommends, are al&s;o the true
Intere&s;t of each Individual? And the peculiar Ad|vantage
of the foregoing Theory, &s;eems to be, that
it furni&s;hes proper Mediums for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT the Virtues, which are immediately <HI>u&s;eful</HI>
or <HI>agreeable</HI> to the Per&s;on, po&s;&s;e&s;t of them, are de|&s;irable
in a View to Self-intere&s;t, it would &s;urely be
&s;uperfluous to prove. Morali&s;ts, indeed, may &s;pare
them&s;elves all the Pains they often take in recom|mending
the&s;e Duties. To what Purpo&s;e collect
Arguments to evince, that Temperance is advanta|geous,
and the Exce&s;&s;es of Plea&s;ure hurtful? When
it appears, that the&s;e Exce&s;&s;es are only denominated
&s;uch, becau&s;e they are hurtful; and that, if the un|limited
U&s;e of &s;trong Liquors, for In&s;tance, no
more impair'd Health or the Faculties of the Mind
and Body than the U&s;e of Air or Water, it would
not be a whit more vicious or blameable.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="191">
IT &s;eems equally &s;uperfluous to prove, that the
<HI>companionable</HI> Virtues of Good-manners and Wit,
Decency and Genteelne&s;s are more de&s;irable than
the contrary Qualities. Vanity alone, without other
Con&s;iderations, is a &s;ufficient Motive to make us
wi&s;h the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Accompli&s;hments. No
Man was ever willingly deficient in this Particular.
All our Failures here proceed from bad Education,
Want of Capacity, or a perver&s;e and unpliable Di&s;|po&s;ition.
Would you have your Company coveted,
admir'd, follow'd; rather than hated, de&s;pis'd,
avoided? Can any one &s;eriou&s;ly deliberate in the
Ca&s;e? As no Enjoyment is &s;incere, without &s;ome
Reference to Company and Society; &s;o no Society
can be agreeable or even tolerable, where a Man
feels his Pre&s;ence unwelcome, and di&s;covers all
around him Symptoms of Aver&s;ion and Di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT why, in the greater Society or Confederacy
of Mankind, &s;hould not the Ca&s;e be the &s;ame as in
particular Clubs and Companies? Why is it more
doubtful, that the enlarg'd Virtues of Humanity,
Genero&s;ity, Beneficence are de&s;irable with a View
to Happine&s;s and Self-intere&s;t, than the limited En|dowments
of Ingenuity and Politene&s;s? Are we
apprehen&s;ive, that tho&s;e &s;ocial Affections have a
greater and more immediate Interference, than any
<PB N="191" REF="192">
other Pur&s;uits, with private Utility, and cannot be
gratify'd without &s;ome important Sacrifices of Ho|nour
and Advantage? If &s;o, we are but ill in&s;tructed
in the Nature of the human Pa&s;&s;ions, and are more
influenc'd by verbal Di&s;tinctions than by real Dif|ferences.</P>
<P>WHATEVER Contradiction, may vulgarly be &s;up|pos'd
betwixt the <HI>&s;ocial</HI> and <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> Sentiments or Di&s;|po&s;itions,
they are really no more oppo&s;ite than
&s;elfi&s;h and ambitious, &s;elfi&s;h and revengeful, &s;elfi&s;h
and vain. 'Tis requi&s;ite there be an original Pro|pen&s;ity
of &s;ome Kind, in order to be a Ba&s;is to Self-love,
by giving a Reli&s;h to the Objects of its Pur|&s;uit;
and none more fit for this Purpo&s;e than Bene|ficence
or Humanity. The Goods of Fortune are
&s;pent in one Gratification or other: The Mi&s;er, who
accumulates his annual Income, and lends it out at
Intere&s;t, has really &s;pent it in the Gratification of
his Avarice. And 'twould be difficult to &s;how, why
a Man is more a Lo&s;er by a generous Action, than
by any other Method of Expence; &s;ince the utmo&s;t
he can attain, by the mo&s;t elaborate Selfi&s;hne&s;s, is
the Indulgence of &s;ome Affection.</P>
<P>NOW if Life, without Pa&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be altogether

his Integrity. And tho' 'tis acknowledg'd, that,
without a Regard to Property, no Society could
&s;ub&s;i&s;t; yet according to the imperfect Way, in which
human Affairs are conducted, a &s;en&s;ible Knave, in
particular Incidents, may think, that an Act of Ini|quity
or Infidelity will make a con&s;iderable Addition

<P>IF the foregoing Hypothe&s;is be receiv'd, 'twill

&s;tated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. I.</NOTE>, concerning the general Principles of Morals;
and tho' we po&s;tpon'd the Deci&s;ion of that Que&s;tion,
le&s;t it &s;hould then involve us in intricate Speculations,
which are totally unfit for moral Di&s;cour&s;es, we may
re&s;ume it at pre&s;ent, and examine how far either
<HI>Rea&s;on</HI> or <HI>Sentiment</HI> enters into all moral Determi|nations.</P>
<P>THE chief Foundation of moral Prai&s;e being &s;up|pos'd
to lie in the U&s;efulne&s;s of any Quality or

out their beneficial Con&s;equences to Society and to
their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. In many Ca&s;es, this is an Affair
liable to great Controver&s;y: Doubts may ari&s;e; op|po&s;ite
Intere&s;ts occur; and a Preference mu&s;t be
given to one Side, from very nice Views and a &s;mall
Overballance of Utility. This is particularly re|markable
in Que&s;tions with regard to Ju&s;tice; as is,
indeed, natural to &s;uppo&s;e from that Species of Uti|lity,
which attends this Virtue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix II.</NOTE>. Were every &s;ingle
In&s;tance of Ju&s;tice, like that of Benevolence, bene|ficial
and u&s;eful to Society; this would be a more
&s;imple State of the Ca&s;e, and &s;eldom liable to great
Controver&s;y. But as &s;ingle In&s;tances of Ju&s;tice are
often pernicious, in their fir&s;t and immediate Ten|dency,
and as the Advantage to Society re&s;ults only
from the Ob&s;ervance of the general Rule, and from
the Concurrence and Combination of &s;everal Per&s;ons
in the &s;ame equitable Conduct; the Ca&s;e here be|comes
more intricate and involv'd. The various Cir|cum&s;tances
of Society; the various Con&s;equences of
any Practice; the various Intere&s;ts, which may be
propos'd: The&s;e on many Occa&s;ions are doubtful,
and &s;ubject to great Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and Enquiry.
The Object of municipal Laws is to fix all
Que&s;tions with regard to Ju&s;tice: The Debates of
Civilians; the Reflections of Politicians; the Pre|cedents
<PB N="199" REF="199">
of Hi&s;tories and public Records, are all
directed to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. And a very accurate
<HI>Rea&s;on</HI> or <HI>Judgment</HI> is often requi&s;ite, to give the true
Determination, amid&s;t &s;uch intricate Doubts ari&s;ing
from ob&s;cure or oppo&s;ite Utilities.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Rea&s;on, when fully a&s;&s;i&s;ted and improv'd,
be &s;ufficient to in&s;truct us in the pernicious or u&s;eful
Tendencies of Qualities and Actions; it is not alone
&s;ufficient to produce any moral Blame or Approba|tion.
Utility is only a Tendency to a certain End;
and were the End totally indifferent to us, we &s;hould
feel the &s;ame Indifference towards the Means. 'Tis
requi&s;ite a <HI>Sentiment</HI> &s;hould here di&s;play it&s;elf, in order
to give a Preference to the u&s;eful above the perni|cious
Tendencies. This Sentiment can be no other
than a Feeling for the Happine&s;s of Mankind, and
a Re&s;entment of their Mi&s;ery; &s;ince the&s;e are the
different Ends, which Virtue and Vice have a Ten|dency
to promote. Here therefore, <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> in&s;tructs
us in the &s;everal Tendencies of Actions, and <HI>Huma|nity</HI>
makes a Di&s;tinction in favour of tho&s;e, which
are u&s;eful and beneficial.</P>
<P>THIS Partition betwixt the Faculties of Under|&s;tanding
and Sentiment, in all moral Deci&s;ions,
&s;eems clear from the preceding Hypothe&s;is. But I
&s;hall &s;uppo&s;e that Hypothe&s;is fal&s;e: 'Twill then be
<PB N="200" REF="200">
requi&s;ite to look out for &s;ome other Theory, that
may be &s;atisfactory; and I dare venture to affirm,
that none &s;uch will ever be found, as long as we
&s;uppo&s;e Rea&s;on to be the &s;ole Source of Morals. To
prove this, it will be proper to weigh the five follow|ing
Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>I. 'Tis ea&s;y for a fal&s;e Hypothe&s;is to maintain
&s;ome Appearance of Truth, while it keeps altoge|ther
in Generals, makes u&s;e of undefin'd Terms, and
employs Compari&s;ons, in&s;tead of In&s;tances. This
is particularly remarkable in that Philo&s;ophy, which
a&s;cribes the Di&s;cernment of all moral Di&s;tinctions to
Rea&s;on alone without the Concurrence of Sentiment.
'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, in any particular In&s;tance, that this
Hypothe&s;is can &s;o much as be render'd intelligible;
whatever &s;pecious Figure it may make in general
Declamations and Di&s;cour&s;es. Examine the Crime
of <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> for In&s;tance; which has Place,
wherever we ob&s;erve Good-will, expre&s;t and known,
along with Good-offices perform'd, on the one Side,
and a Return of Ill-will or Indifference, with Ill-offices
or Neglect, on the other: Anatomize all
the&s;e Circum&s;tances, and examine, by your Rea&s;on
alone, wherein con&s;i&s;ts the Demerit or Blame: You
never will come to any I&s;&s;ue or Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="201">
REASON judges either of <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> or of <HI>Re|lations.</HI>
Enquire then, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> where is that Matter of
Fact, which we here call <HI>Crime;</HI> point it out; de|termine
the Time of its Exi&s;tence; de&s;cribe its
E&s;&s;ence or Nature; explain the Sen&s;e or Faculty, to
which it di&s;covers it&s;elf. It re&s;ides in the Mind of
the Per&s;on, who is ungrateful. He mu&s;t, therefore,
feel it and be con&s;cious of it. But nothing is there,
except the Pa&s;&s;ion of Ill-will or ab&s;olute Indifference.
You cannot &s;ay, that the&s;e, of them&s;elves, always,
and in all Circum&s;tances, are Crimes. No: They
are only Crimes, when directed towards Per&s;ons,
who have before expre&s;t and di&s;play'd Good-will
towards us. Con&s;equently, we may infer, that the
Crime of Ingratitude is not any particular individual
<HI>Fact;</HI> but ari&s;es from a Complication of Circum|&s;tances,
which, being pre&s;ented to the Spectator,
excites the <HI>Sentiment</HI> of Blame, by the particular
Structure and Fabric of his Mind.</P>
<P>THIS Repre&s;entation, you &s;ay, is fal&s;e. Crime,
indeed, con&s;i&s;ts not in a particular <HI>Fact,</HI> of who&s;e
Reality we are a&s;&s;ur'd by <HI>Rea&s;on:</HI> But it con&s;i&s;ts in
certain <HI>moral Relations,</HI> di&s;coverable by Rea&s;on, in
the &s;ame Manner as we di&s;cover, by Rea&s;on, the
Truths of Geometry or Algebra. But what are
the Relations, I a&s;k, of which you here talk? In
<PB N="202" REF="202">
the Ca&s;e &s;tated above, I &s;ee fir&s;t Good-will and Good-offices,
in one Per&s;on; then Ill-will and Ill-offices
in the other: Betwixt the&s;e, there is the Relation
of <HI>Contrariety.</HI> Does the Crime con&s;i&s;t in that Re|lation?
But &s;uppo&s;e a Per&s;on bore me Ill-will or
did me Ill-offices; and I, in return, were indifferent
towards him, or did him Good-offices: Here is the
&s;ame Relation of <HI>Contrariety;</HI> and yet my Conduct
is highly laudable. Twi&s;t and turn this Matter, as
much as you will, you can never re&s;t the Morality
on Relation; but mu&s;t have Recour&s;e to the Deci|&s;ions
of Sentiment.</P>
<P>WHEN 'tis affirm'd, that two and three are equal
to the half of ten; this Relation of Equality, I
under&s;tand perfectly. I conceive, that if ten be di|vided
into two Parts, of which one had as many
Unites as the other; and if any of the&s;e Parts be
compar'd to two added to three, it will contain as
many Unites as that compound Number. But when
you draw thence a Compari&s;on to moral Relations,
I own, I am altogether at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand you.
A moral Action, a Crime, &s;uch as Ingratitude, is a
complicated Object. Does the Morality con&s;i&s;t in
the Relation of its Parts to each other. How?
After what Manner? Specify the Relation: Be
more particular and explicite in your Propo&s;itions;
and you will ea&s;ily &s;ee their Fal&s;hood.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="203">
NO, &s;ay you, the Morality con&s;i&s;ts in the Relation
of Action to the Rule of Right; and they are de|nominated
good or ill, according as they agree or
di&s;agree with it. What then is this Rule of Right?
Wherein does it con&s;i&s;t? How is it determin'd?
By Rea&s;on, you'll &s;ay, which examines the moral
Relations of Actions. So that moral Relations are
determin'd by the Compari&s;on of Actions to a Rule.
And the Role is determin'd by con&s;idering the
moral Relations of Objects. Is not this fine Rea|&s;oning?</P>
<P>ALL this is Metaphy&s;ics, you cry. That is
enough: There needs nothing more to give a &s;trong
Pre&s;umption of Fal&s;hood. Yes, reply I: Here are
Metaphy&s;ics &s;urely: But they are all on your Side,
who advance an ab&s;tru&s;e Hypothe&s;is, which can
never be made intelligible, nor quadrate to any par|ticular
In&s;tance or Illu&s;tration. The Hypothe&s;is we
embrace is plain. It maintains, that Morality is de|termin'd
by Sentiment. It defines Virtue to be,
<HI>whatever mental Action or Quality gives to a Spectator
the plea&s;ing Sentiment of Approbation;</HI> and Vice the
contrary. We then proceed to examine a plain
Matter of Fact, <HI>viz.</HI> what Actions have this Influ|ence:
We con&s;ider all the Circum&s;tances, in which
the&s;e Actions agree: And from thence endeavour to
<PB N="204" REF="204">
extract &s;ome general Ob&s;ervations with regard to
the&s;e Sentiments. If you call this Metaphy&s;ics, and
find any thing ab&s;tru&s;e here, you need only conclude,
that your Turn of Mind is not &s;uited to the moral
Sciences.</P>
<P>II. WHEN a Man, at any Time, deliberates con|cerning
his own Conduct, (as, whether he had
better, in a particular Emergence, a&s;&s;i&s;t a Brother or
a Benefactor) he mu&s;t con&s;ider the&s;e &s;eparate Rela|tions,
with the whole Circum&s;tances and Situation
of the Per&s;ons, in order to determine his &s;uperior
Duty and Obligation: And in order to determine
the Proportion of Lines in any Triangle, 'tis ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to examine the Nature of that Figure, and
the Relations, which its &s;everal Parts bear to each
other. But notwith&s;tanding this apparent Similarity
in the two Ca&s;es, there is, at the bottom, an ex|treme
Difference betwixt them. A &s;peculative
Rea&s;oner concerning Triangles or Circles con&s;iders
the &s;everal known and given Relations of the Parts
of the&s;e Figures; and from thence infers &s;ome un|known
Relation, which is dependent on the former.
But in moral Deliberations, we mu&s;t be acquainted,
before-hand, with all the Objects, and all their Re|lations
to each other; and from a Compari&s;on of
the whole, fix our Choice or Approbation. No new
Fact to be a&s;certain'd: No new Relation to be
<PB N="205" REF="205">
di&s;cover'd. The whole Circum&s;tances of the Ca&s;e
are &s;uppos'd to be laid before us, 'ere we can fix any
Sentence of Blame or Approbation. If any material
Circum&s;tance by yet unknown or doubtful, we mu&s;t
fir&s;t employ our Enquiry or intellectual Faculties to
a&s;&s;ure us of it; and &s;u&s;pend for a Time all moral
Deci&s;ion or Sentiment. While we are ignorant,
whether a Man was Aggre&s;&s;or or not, how can we
determine, whether the per&s;on, who kill'd him, be
criminal or innocent? But after every Circum&s;tance,
every Relation is known, the Under&s;tanding has no
farther Room to operate, nor any Object, on which
it could employ it&s;elf. The Approbation or Blame,
which then en&s;ues, cannot be the Work of the Judg|ment,
but of the Heart, and is not a &s;peculative Pro|po&s;ition
or Affirmation, but an active Feeling or Sen|timent.
In the Di&s;qui&s;itions of the Under&s;tanding,
from known Circum&s;tances and Relations, we infer
&s;ome new and unknown. In moral Deci&s;ions, the
whole Circum&s;tances and Relations mu&s;t be ante|cedently
known; and the Mind, from the Contem|plation
of the Whole, feels &s;ome new Impre&s;&s;ion of
Affection of Di&s;gu&s;t, E&s;teem or Contempt, Appro|bation
or Blame.</P>
<P>HENCE the great Difference betwixt a Mi&s;take of
<HI>Fact</HI> and one of <HI>Right;</HI> and hence the Rea&s;on, why
the one is commonly criminal and not the other.
<PB N="206" REF="206">
When <HI>OEdipus</HI> kill'd <HI>Laius,</HI> he was ignorant of the
Relation, and from Circum&s;tances, innocent and in|voluntary,
form'd erroneous Opinions concerning
the Action he committed. But when <HI>Nero</HI> kill'd
<HI>Agrippina,</HI> all the Relations betwixt him&s;elf and the
per&s;on, and all the Circum&s;tances of the Fact were
antecedently known to him: But the Motive of Re|venge,
or Fear or Intere&s;t, in his &s;avage Heart, pre|vail'd
over the Sentiments of Duty and Humanity.
And when we expre&s;s a Dete&s;tation again&s;t him, to
which he, him&s;elf, in a little Time, became in&s;en|&s;ible;
'tis not, that we &s;ee any Relations, of which
he was ignorant, but that, from the Rectitude of
our Di&s;po&s;ition, we feel Sentiments, again&s;t which
he was harden'd, from Flattery and a long Per&s;eve|rance
in the mo&s;t enormous Crimes. In the&s;e Sen|timents,
then, not in a Di&s;covery of Relations of
any Kind, do all moral Determinations con&s;i&s;t.
Before we can pretend to form any Deci&s;ion of this
kind, every Thing mu&s;t be known and a&s;certain'd
on the Side of the Object or Action. Nothing re|mains
but to feel, on our Part, &s;ome Sentiment of
Blame or Approbation, whence we pronounce the
Action criminal or virtuous.</P>
<P>III. THIS Doctrine will become &s;till more evident,
if we compare moral Beauty with natural, to which,
in many Particulars, it bears &s;o near a Re&s;emblance.
<PB N="207" REF="207">
'Tis on the Proportion, Relation, and Po&s;ition of
Parts, that all natural Beauty depends; but 'twould
be ab&s;urd thence to infer, that the Perception of
Beauty, like that of Truth in geometrical Problems,
con&s;i&s;ts altogether in the Perception of Relations,
and was perform'd entirely by the Under&s;tanding or
intellectual Faculties. In all the Sciences, our
Mind, from the known Relations, inve&s;tigates the
unknown: But in all Deci&s;ions of Ta&s;te or external
Beauty, the whole Relations are before-hand obvious
to the Eye, and we thence proceed to feel a Senti|ment
of Complacency or Di&s;gu&s;t, according to the
Nature of the Object, and Di&s;po&s;ition of our Or|gans.</P>
<P><HI>EUCLID</HI> has fully explain'd all the Qualities
of the Circle; but has not, in any Propo&s;ition, &s;aid
a Word of its Beauty. The Rea&s;on is evident. The
Beauty is not a Quality of the Circle. It lies not in
any Part of the Line, who&s;e Parts are all equally
di&s;tant from a common Center. It is only the Effect,
which that Figure operates upon the Mind, who&s;e
peculiar Fabric or Structure renders it &s;u&s;ceptible of
&s;uch Sentiments. In vain, would you look for it in
the Circle, or &s;eek it, either by your Sen&s;es or by
mathematical Rea&s;onings, in all the Properties of
that Figure.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="208">
ATTEND to <HI>Palladio</HI> and <HI>Perrault,</HI> while they ex|plain
all the Parts and Proportions of a Pillar: They
talk of the Cornice and Freeze and Ba&s;e and Enta|blature
and Shaft and Architrave; and give the De|&s;cription
and Po&s;ition of each of the&s;e Members.
But &s;hould you a&s;k the De&s;cription and Po&s;ition of
its Beauty, they would readily reply, that the Beauty
is not any of the Parts or Members of a Pillar, but
re&s;ults from the Whole, when that complicated Fi|gure
is pre&s;ented to an intelligent Mind, &s;u&s;ceptible
of tho&s;e finer Sen&s;ations. Till &s;uch a Spectator ap|pear,
there is nothing but a Figure of &s;uch particular
Dimen&s;ions and Proportions: From his Sentiments

<P>AGAIN; attend to <HI>Cicero,</HI> while he paints the
Crimes of a <HI>Verres</HI> or a <HI>Catiline;</HI> you mu&s;t acknow|ledge,
that the moral Turpitude re&s;ults, in the &s;ame
Manner, from the Contemplation of the Whole,

a particular Structure and Formation. The Orator
may paint Rage, In&s;olence, Barbarity on the one
Side: Meekne&s;s, Sufferance, Sorrow, Innocence on
the other: But if you feel no Indignation or Com|pa&s;&s;ion
ari&s;e in you from this Complication of Cir|cum&s;tances,
you would in vain a&s;k him, wherein
con&s;i&s;t, the Crime or Villainy, which he &s;o vehe|mently

Subject it fir&s;t began to exi&s;t: And what has a few

alter'd or annihilated. No &s;atisfactory An&s;wer can
be given to any of the&s;e Que&s;tions, upon the ab&s;tract
Hypothe&s;is of Morals; and we mu&s;t at la&s;t acknow|ledge,
that the Crime or Immorality is no particular
Fact or Relation, which can be the Object of the
Under&s;tanding: But ari&s;es altogether from the Sen|timent
of Di&s;approbation, which, by the Structure
of human Nature, we unavoidably feel on the Ap|prehen&s;ion
of Barbarity or Treachery.</P>
<P>IV. INANIMATE Objects may bear to each other
all the &s;ame Relations, which we ob&s;erve in moral
Agents; tho' the former can never be the Object of
Love or Hatred, nor are con&s;equently &s;u&s;ceptible of

murder'd <HI>Agrippina;</HI> and if Morality con&s;i&s;ted in any

<P>V. IT appears evident, that the ultimate Ends of

for by <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> but recommend them&s;elves entirely to

the Sentiments and Affections of Mankind, without

de&s;ire a Rea&s;on, <HI>why he hates Pain,</HI> 'tis impo&s;&s;ible he

never refer'd to any other Object.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, to your &s;econd Que&s;tion, <HI>why he de&s;ires
Health,</HI> he may al&s;o reply, that <HI>'tis requi&s;ite for the

on that head,</HI> he will an&s;wer, <HI>becau&s;e he de&s;ires to get
Money.</HI> If you demand, <HI>Why? It is the In&s;trument
of Plea&s;ure,</HI> &s;ays he. And beyond this, 'tis an Ab|&s;urdity
to a&s;k for a Rea&s;on. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible there
can be a Progre&s;s <HI>in infinitum;</HI> and that one Thing
can always be the Rea&s;on, why another is de&s;ir'd.
Something mu&s;t be de&s;irable on its own Account, and
becau&s;e of its immediate Accord or Agreement with
human Sentiment and Affection.</P>
<P>NOW as Virtue is an End, and is de&s;irable on its
own Account, without Fee or Reward, merely for
the immediate Satisfaction it conveys; 'tis requi&s;ite
there &s;hould be &s;ome Sentiment, which it touches;
&s;ome internal Ta&s;te or Feeling, or whatever you
<PB N="211" REF="211">
plea&s;e to call it, which di&s;tingui&s;hes moral Good and
Evil, and which embraces the one and rejects the
other.</P>
<P>THUS the di&s;tinct Boundaries and Offices of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI>
and <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> are ea&s;ily a&s;certain'd. The former conveys
the Knowledge of Truth and Fal&s;hood: The latter
gives the Sentiment of Beauty and Deformity,
Vice and Virtue. The one di&s;covers Objects, as
they really &s;tand in Nature, without Addition or
Diminution: The other has a productive Faculty,
and guilding or &s;taining all natural Objects with the
Colours, borrow'd from internal Sentiment, rai&s;es
in a Manner, a new Creation. Rea&s;on, being cool
and di&s;engag'd, is no Motive to Action, and directs
only the Impul&s;e, receiv'd from Appetite or Inclina|tion,
by &s;howing us the Means of obtaining Happi|ne&s;s
or avoiding Mi&s;ery: Ta&s;te, as it gives Plea&s;ure
or Pain, and thereby con&s;titutes Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery,
becomes a Motive to Action, and is the fir&s;t Spring
or Impul&s;e to De&s;ire and Volition. From Circum|&s;tances
and Relations, known or &s;uppos'd, the for|mer
leads us to the Di&s;covery of the conceal'd and
unknown: After all Circum&s;tances and Relations
are laid before us, the latter makes us feel from the
Whole a new Sentiment of Blame or Approbation.
The Standard of the one, being founded on the Na|ture
of Things, is eternal and inflexible, even by
<PB N="212" REF="212">
the Will of the Supreme Being: The Standard of the
other, ari&s;ing from the internal Frame and Con&s;titu|tion

<HEAD>APPENDIX II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Some farther Con&s;iderations with regard to
JUSTICE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Intention of this Appendix is to give
&s;ome more particular Explication of the Ori|gin
and Nature of Ju&s;tice, and mark &s;ome Diffe|rences
betwixt it and the other Virtues.</P>
<P>THE &s;ocial Virtues of Humanity and Benevolence
exert their Influence immediately, by a direct Ten|dency
or In&s;tinct, which keeps chiefly in View the
&s;imple Object, that moves the Affections, and com|prehends
not any Scheme or Sy&s;tem, nor the Con&s;e|quences
re&s;ulting from the Concurrence, Imitation,
or Example of others. A Parent flies to the Relief
of his Child; tran&s;ported by that natural Sympathy,
which actuates him, and which affords no Lei&s;ure
to reflect on the Sentiments or Conduct of the re&s;t
of Mankind in like Circum&s;tances. A generous
<PB N="214" REF="214">
Man embraces cheerfully an Opportunity of &s;erving
his Friend; becau&s;e he then feels him&s;elf under the
Dominion of the beneficent Affections, nor is he
concern'd whether any other Per&s;on in the Univer&s;e
was ever before actuated by &s;uch noble Motives, or
will ever afterwards prove their Influence. In all
the&s;e Ca&s;es, the &s;ocial Pa&s;&s;ions have in View a &s;ingle
individual Object, and pur&s;ue alone the Safety or
Happine&s;s of the Per&s;on, lov'd and e&s;teem'd. With
this, they are &s;atisfy'd: In this, they acquie&s;ce.
And as the Good re&s;ulting from their benign Influ|ence,
is in it&s;elf compleat and entire, it al&s;o excites
the moral Sentiment of Approbation, without any
Reflection on farther Con&s;equences, or more enlarg'd
Views of the Concurrence or Imitation of the other
Members of Society. On the contrary, were the
generous Friend or di&s;intere&s;ted Patriot to &s;tand alone
in the Practice of Beneficence; this would rather in|hance
his Value in our Eyes, and join the Prai&s;e of
Rarity and Novelty to his other more exalted
Merits.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;e is not the &s;ame with the &s;ocial Virtues
of Ju&s;tice and Fidelity. They are highly u&s;eful, or
indeed ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Well-being of
Mankind: But the Benefit, re&s;ulting from them, is
not the Con&s;equence of every individual &s;ingle Act;
but ari&s;es from the whole Scheme or Sy&s;tem, con|cur'd
<PB N="215" REF="215">
in by the whole, or the greate&s;t Part of the So|ciety.
General Peace and Order is the Attendant
of Ju&s;tice or a general Ab&s;tinence from the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions
of others: But a particular Regard to the par|ticular
Right of one individual Citizen may fre|quently,
con&s;ider'd in it&s;elf, be attended with per|nicious
Con&s;equences. The Re&s;ult of the &s;everal
Acts is here often directly oppo&s;ite to that of the
whole Sy&s;tem of Actions; and the former may be
extremely hurtful, while the latter is, to the highe&s;t
Degree, advantageous. Riches, inherited from a
Parent, are, in a bad Man's Hand, the In&s;truments
of Mi&s;chief. The Right of Succe&s;&s;ion may, in one
In&s;tance, be hurtful. Its Benefit ari&s;es only from
the Ob&s;ervance of the general Rule; and 'tis &s;uf|ficient,
if Compen&s;ation be thereby made for all the
Ills and Inconveniencies, which flow from particular
Characters and Situations.</P>
<P><HI>CYRUS,</HI> young and unexperienc'd, con&s;ider'd
only the individual Ca&s;e before him, and reflected
on its limited Fitne&s;s and Convenience, when he
a&s;&s;ign'd the long Coat to the tall Boy, and the &s;hort
Coat to the other of &s;maller Size. His Governor
in&s;tructed him better; while he pointed out more
enlarg'd Views and Con&s;equences, and inform'd his
Pupil of the general, inflexible Rules, requi&s;ite to
&s;upport general Peace and Order in Society.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="216">
THE Happine&s;s and Pro&s;perity of Mankind,
ari&s;ing from the &s;ocial Virtue of Benevolence and its
Subdivi&s;ions, may be compar'd to a Wall, built by
many Hands; which &s;till ri&s;es by each Stone, that
is heap'd upon it, and receives proportional Encrea&s;e
to the Diligence and Care of each Workman. The
&s;ame Happine&s;s, rais'd by the &s;ocial Virtue of Ju&s;tice
and its Subdivi&s;ions, may be compar'd to the build|ing
of a Vault, where each individual Stone would,
of it&s;elf, fall to the Ground; nor does the whole
Fabric &s;upport it&s;elf, but by the mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance and
Combination of its corre&s;pondent Parts.</P>
<P>ALL the Laws of Nature, which regulate Pro|perty,
as well as all civil Laws, are general, and
regard alone &s;ome e&s;&s;ential Circum&s;tances of the
Ca&s;e, without taking into Con&s;ideration the Cha|racters,
Situations and Connexions of the Per&s;ons
concern'd, or any particular Con&s;equences, that may
re&s;ult from the Determination of the&s;e Laws, in
every particular Ca&s;e, that offers. They deprive,
without Scruple, a beneficent Man of all his Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions,
if acquir'd by Mi&s;take, without a good Title;
in order to be&s;tow them on a &s;elfi&s;h Mi&s;er, who has
already heap'd up immen&s;e Stores of &s;uperfluous
Riches Public Utility requires, that Property &s;hould
be regulated by general inflexible Rules; and tho'
<PB N="217" REF="217">
&s;uch Rules are adopted as be&s;t &s;erve the &s;ame End of
public Utility, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for them to prevent
all particular Hard&s;hips, or make beneficial Con&s;e|quences
re&s;ult from every individual Ca&s;e. 'Tis
&s;ufficient, if the whole Plan or Scheme be nece&s;&s;ary
to the Support of civil Society, and if the Ballance
of Good, in the main, does thereby preponderate
much above that of Evil. Even the general Laws
of the Univer&s;e, tho' plann'd by infinite Wi&s;dom,
cannot exclude all Evil or Inconvenience, in every
particular Operation.</P>
<P>IT has been a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome, that all Ju&s;tice ari&s;es
from HUMAN CONVENTIONS, and pro|ceeds
from the voluntary Choice, Con&s;ent, or Com|bination
of Mankind. If by <HI>Convention</HI> be here
meant a <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> (which is the mo&s;t u&s;ual Sen&s;e of
the Word) nothing can be more ab&s;urd, than this
Po&s;ition. The Ob&s;ervance of Promi&s;es is it&s;elf one
of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Parts of Ju&s;tice; and we
are not &s;urely bound to keep our Word, becau&s;e we
have given our Word to keep it. But if by Con|vention
be meant a Sen&s;e of common Intere&s;t;
which Sen&s;e each Man feels in his own Brea&s;t, which
he ob&s;erves in his Fellows, and which carries him,
in concurrence with others, into a general Plan or
Sy&s;tem of Actions, that tend to public Utility; it
mu&s;t be own'd, that, in this Sen&s;e, Ju&s;tice ari&s;es
<PB N="218" REF="218">
from human Conventions. For if it be allow'd
(what is, indeed, evident) that the particular Con|&s;equences
of a particular Act of Ju&s;tice may be
hurtful to the Public as well as to Individuals; it
follows, that every Man, in embracing that Virtue,
mu&s;t have an Eye to the whole Plan or Sy&s;tem, and
mu&s;t expect the Concurrence of his Fellows in the
&s;ame Conduct and Behaviour. Were all his Views
to terminate in the particular Con&s;equences of each
particular Act of his own, his Benevolence and Hu|manity,
as well as Self-love, might often pre&s;cribe
to him Mea&s;ures of Conduct very different from
tho&s;e, which are agreeable to the &s;trict Rules of
Right and Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THUS two Men pull the Oars of a Boat, by com|mon
Convention, for common Intere&s;t, without any
Promi&s;e or Contract: Thus Gold and Silver are
made the Mea&s;ures of Exchange; thus Speech and
Words and Language are fixt, by human Convention
and Agreement. Whatever is advantageous to two
or more Per&s;ons, if all perform their Part; but what
lo&s;es all Advantage, if only one perform, can ari&s;e

THE Word, <HI>natural,</HI> is commonly taken in &s;o
many Sen&s;es, and is of &s;uch loo&s;e Signification, that
it &s;eems to little Purpo&s;e to di&s;pute, whether Ju&s;tice
be natural or not. If Self-love, if Benevolence be
natural to Man; if Rea&s;on and Forethought be al&s;o
natural; then may the &s;ame Epithet be apply'd to
Ju&s;tice, Order, Fidelity, Property, Society. Men's
Inclination, their Nece&s;&s;ities lead them to combine;
their Under&s;tanding and Experience tell them, that
this Combination is impo&s;&s;ible, where each governs

<PB N="220" REF="220">
like Pa&s;&s;ions and Reflections in others, the Sentiment
of Ju&s;tice, thro' all Ages, has infallibly and certainly
had place, to &s;ome Degree or other, in every Indi|vidual
of human Species. In &s;o &s;agacious an Ani|mal,
what nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;es from the Exertion of his

Had Men liv'd without Society, Property had never been known, and neither Ju&s;tice nor Inju&s;tice had ever exi&s;ted. But Society among&s;t human Creatures, had been impo&s;&s;ible, without Rea&s;on and Forethought. Inferior Animals, that unite, are guided by In&s;tinct, which &s;upplies the Place of Rea&s;on. But all the&s;e Di&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">s are merely verbal.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMONGST all civiliz'd Nations, it has been the
con&s;tant Endeavour to remove every Thing arbitrary
and partial from the Deci&s;ion of Property, and to
fix the Sentence of Judges by &s;uch general Views
and Con&s;iderations, as may be equal to every
Member of the Society. For be&s;ides, that nothing
could be more dangerous than to accu&s;tom the
Bench, even in the &s;malle&s;t In&s;tance, to regard pri|vate
Friend&s;hip or Enmity; 'tis certain, that Men,
<PB N="221" REF="221">
where they imagine, that there was no other Rea&s;on
for the Preference of their Adver&s;ary but per&s;onal
Favour, are apt to entertain the &s;tronge&s;t Jealou&s;y
and Ill-will again&s;t the Magi&s;trates and Judges.
When natural Rea&s;on, therefore, points out no fixt
View of public Utility, by which a Controver&s;y of
Property can be decided, po&s;itive Laws are often
fram'd to &s;upply its Place, and direct the Procedure
of all Courts of Judicature. Where the&s;e too fail,
as often happens, Precedents are call'd for; and a
former Deci&s;ion, tho' given it&s;elf without any &s;uffici|ent
Rea&s;on, ju&s;tly becomes a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for a
new Deci&s;ion. If direct Laws and Precedents be
wanting, imperfect and indirect ones are brought in
Aid; and the controverted Ca&s;e is rang'd under them,
by analogical Rea&s;onings, and Compari&s;ons, and
Similitudes, and Corre&s;pondencies, that are often
more fanciful than real. In general, it may &s;afely
be a&s;&s;erted, that Juri&s;prudence is, in this re&s;pect,
different from all the Sciences; and in many of its
nicer Que&s;tions, there cannot properly be &s;aid to be
Truth or Fal&s;hood on either Side. If one Pleader
brings the Ca&s;e under any former Law or Precedent,
by a refin'd Analogy or Compari&s;on; the oppo&s;ite
Pleader is not at a Lo&s;s to find an oppo&s;ite Analogy or
Compari&s;on: And the Preference given by the Judge
is often founded more on Ta&s;te and Imagination.
<PB N="222" REF="222">
than on any &s;olid Argument. Public Utility is the
general View of all Courts of Judicature; and this
Utility too requires a &s;table Rule in all Controver&s;ies:
But where &s;everal Rules, nearly equal and indif|ferent,
pre&s;ent them&s;elves, 'tis a very &s;light Turn of
Thought, which fixes the Deci&s;ion in favour of either

<HEAD>A
DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>MY Friend, <HI>Palamedes,</HI> who is as great a Ram|bler
in his Principles as in his Per&s;on, and
who has run over, by Study and Travel, almo&s;t
every Region of the intellectual and material World,
&s;urpriz'd me lately with an Account of a Nation,
with whom, he told me, he had pa&s;s'd a con&s;iderable
Part of his Life, and whom he found, in the main,
an extreme civiliz'd, intelligent People.</P>
<P>THERE is a State, &s;ay'd he, in the World, call'd
<HI>Fourli,</HI> no matter for its Longitude or Latitude,
who&s;e Ways of thinking in many Things, particu|larly
in Morals, are diametrically oppo&s;ite to ours.
When I came among&s;t them, I found I mu&s;t &s;ubmit
to double Pains; fir&s;t to learn the Meaning of the
Terms in their Language, and then to know the Im|port
of tho&s;e Terms, and the Prai&s;e or Blame at|tach'd
to them. After a Word had been explain'd
to me, and the Character, which it expre&s;t, had
<PB N="224" REF="224">
been de&s;crib'd, I concluded, that &s;uch an Epithet
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the greate&s;t Reproach in the
World; and was extremely &s;urpriz'd to find one, in
a public Company, apply it to a Per&s;on, with whom
he liv'd in the &s;tricte&s;t Intimacy and Friend&s;hip.
<HI>You fancy,</HI> &s;aid I, one Day, to an Acquaintance,
<HI>that</HI> Changuis <HI>is your mortal Enemy: I love to ex|tingui&s;h
Quarrels; and I mu&s;t, therefore, tell you, that
Heard him talk of you in the mo&s;t advantageous Manner.</HI>
But to my great A&s;toni&s;hment, when I repeated
<HI>Changuis</HI>'s Words, tho' I had both remember'd and un|der&s;tood
them perfectly, I found, that they were
taken for the mo&s;t mortal Affront, and that I had
very innocently render'd the Breach betwixt the&s;e
Per&s;ons altogether irreparable.</P>
<P>As it was my Fortune to come among&s;t this People
on a very advantageous Footing, I was immediately
introduc'd to the be&s;t Company; and being de&s;ir'd
to live with <HI>Alcheic,</HI> I readily accepted his Invitation,
as I found him univer&s;ally e&s;teem'd for his per&s;onal
Merit; and indeed regarded by every one in <HI>Fourli,</HI>
as a perfect Character.</P>
<P>ONE Evening he invited me, as an Amu&s;ement,
to bear him Company in a Serenade, which he in|tended
to give <HI>Gulki,</HI> with whom, he told me, he
was extremely enamour'd; and I foon found his
<PB N="225" REF="225">
Ta&s;te was not &s;ingular: For we met many of his
Rivals, who had come on the &s;ame Errand. I very
naturally concluded, that this Flame of his mu&s;t be
one of the fine&s;t Women in Town; and I already
felt a &s;ecret Inclination to &s;ee her, and be acquainted
with her. But as the Moon began to ri&s;e, I was
much &s;urpriz'd to find, that we were in the Mid&s;t of
the Univer&s;ity, where <HI>Gulki</HI> &s;tudy'd: And I was
&s;omewhat a&s;ham'd for having attended my Friend,
on &s;uch an Errand.</P>
<P>I WAS told afterwards, that <HI>Alcheic</HI>'s Choice of
<HI>Gulki</HI> was very much approv'd of by all the good
Company in Town; and that 'twas expected, while
he gratify'd his own Pa&s;&s;ion, he would perform to
that young Man the &s;ame good Office, which he had
him&s;elf ow'd to <HI>Elcouf.</HI> It &s;eems <HI>Alcheic</HI> had been
very hand&s;ome in his Youth, and been courted by
many Lovers; but had be&s;tow'd his Favours chiefly
on the &s;age <HI>Elcouf;</HI> to whom he was &s;uppos'd to owe,
in a great Mea&s;ure, the a&s;toni&s;hing Progre&s;s he had
made in Philo&s;ophy and Virtue.</P>
<P>IT gave me &s;ome Surprize, that <HI>Alcheic</HI>'s Wife
(who by-the-bye happen'd al&s;o to be his Si&s;ter) was
no way &s;candaliz'd at this Species of Infidelity.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="226">
MUCH about the &s;ame Time I di&s;cover'd (for it
was not attempted to be kept a Secret from me or
any Body) that <HI>Alcheic</HI> was a Murderer and a Parri|cide,
and had put to Death an innocent Per&s;on, the
mo&s;t nearly connected with him, and whom he was
oblig'd to protect and defend by all the Ties of Na|ture
and Humanity. When I a&s;k'd, with all the
Caution and Deference imaginable, what was his
Motive for this Action; he reply'd coolly, that he
was not then &s;o much at his Ea&s;e as he is at pre&s;ent,
and that he had acted, in that Particular, by the Ad|vice
of all his Friends.</P>
<P>HAVING heard <HI>Alcheic</HI>'s Virtue &s;o extremely cele|brated,
I pretended to join in the general Voice of
Acclamation, and only a&s;k'd, by way of Curio&s;ity,
as a Stranger, which of all his noble Actions was
mo&s;t highly applauded; and I &s;oon found, that all
Sentiments were united in giving the Preference to
the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of <HI>Usbek.</HI> This <HI>Usbek</HI> had been to
the la&s;t Moment <HI>Alcheic</HI>'s intimate Friend, had lay'd
many high Obligations upon him, had even &s;av'd
his Life on a certain Occa&s;ion, and had, by his Will,
which was found after the Murder, made him his
Heir to a con&s;iderable Part of his Fortune. <HI>Alcheic,</HI>
it &s;eems, con&s;pir'd with about twenty or thirty more,
mo&s;t of them al&s;o <HI>Usbek</HI>'s Friends; and falling all

together on that unhappy Man, when he was not
aware, they had tore him with a hundred Wounds;
and given him that Reward for all his pa&s;t Favours
and Obligations. <HI>Usbek,</HI> &s;aid the general Voice of
the People, had many great and good Qualities:
His very Vices were &s;hining, magnificent, and ge|nerous:
But this Action of <HI>Alcheic</HI> &s;ets him far above
<HI>Usbek</HI> in the Eyes of all Judges of Merit; and is
one of the noble&s;t, that ever perhaps the Sun &s;hone
upon.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Part of <HI>Alcheic</HI>'s Conduct, which I al&s;o
found highly applauded, was his Behaviour towards
<HI>Cali&s;h,</HI> with whom he was join'd in a Project or
Undertaking of &s;ome Importance. <HI>Cali&s;h,</HI> being a
pa&s;&s;ionate Man, gave <HI>Alcheic,</HI> one Day, a &s;ound
Drubbing; which he took very patiently, waited
the Return of <HI>Cali&s;h</HI>'s good Humour, kept &s;till a fair
Corre&s;pondence with him; and by that Means
brought the Affair, in which they were join'd, to a
happy I&s;&s;ue, and gain'd him&s;elf immortal Honour
by his remarkable Temper and Moderation.</P>
<P>I HAVE lately receiv'd a Letter from a Corre&s;pon|dent
in <HI>Fourli,</HI> by which I learn, that &s;ince my De|parture,
<HI>Alcheic,</HI> falling into a bad State of Health,
has fairly hang'd him&s;elf; and has dy'd univer&s;ally
regreted and applauded by every one in that Country.
So virtuous and noble a Life, &s;ays each <HI>Fourlian,</HI>
<PB N="228" REF="228">
could not be better crown'd than by &s;o noble an
End; and he has prov'd by this, as well as by all
his other Actions, what was his con&s;tant Principle
during his Life, and what he boa&s;ted of near his la&s;t
Moments, that a wi&s;e Man is &s;carce inferior to the
great God, <HI>Vitzli.</HI> This is the Name of the Supreme
Deity among&s;t the <HI>Fourlians.</HI></P>
<P>THE Notions of this People, continu'd <HI>Palamedes,</HI>
are as extraordinary with regard to Good-manners
and Sociablene&s;s, as with regard to Morals. My
Friend <HI>Alcheic</HI> form'd once a Party for my Entertain|ment,
compos'd of all the prime Wits and Philo&s;o|phers
of <HI>Fourli;</HI> and each of us brought his Me&s;s
along with him to the Place, where we a&s;&s;embled.
I ob&s;erv'd one of them to be wor&s;e provided than
the re&s;t, and offer'd him a Share of mine, which hap|pen'd
to be a roa&s;ted Pullet: And I could not but
remark, that he, and all the re&s;t of the Company
&s;tar'd at my Simplicity. I was told, that <HI>Alcheic</HI> had
once &s;o much Intere&s;t with his Club as to prevail
with them to eat in common, and that he had made
u&s;e of an Artifice to that Purpo&s;e. He per&s;uaded
tho&s;e, whom he ob&s;erv'd to be <HI>wor&s;t</HI> provided, to
offer their Me&s;s to the Company; after which, the
others, who had brought more delicate Fare, were
a&s;ham'd not to make the &s;ame Offer. This is regarded
as &s;o extraordinary a Event, that it has &s;ince, as I
<PB N="229" REF="229">
learn, been recorded in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Alcheic</HI>'s Life,
compos'd by one of the greate&s;t Geniu&s;es of <HI>Fourli.</HI></P>
<P>PRAY, &s;ays I, <HI>Palamedes,</HI> when you was at <HI>Fourli,</HI>
did you al&s;o learn the Art of turning your Friends
into Ridicule, by telling them &s;trange Stories, and
then laughing at them, if they believ'd you. I a&s;&s;ure
you, reply'd he, that had I been di&s;pos'd to learn
&s;uch a Le&s;&s;on, there was no Place in the World more
proper. My Friend, &s;o often mention'd, did no|thing,
from Morning to Night, but &s;neer, and
banter, and railly; and you could &s;carce ever di&s;tin|gui&s;h,
whether he was in Je&s;t or Earne&s;t; But you
think, then, that my Story is improbable; and that
I have us'd, or rather abus'd the Privilege of a
Traveller. To be &s;ure, &s;ays I, you was but in Je&s;t.
Such barbarous and &s;avage Manners are not only in|compatible
with a civiliz'd, intelligent People, &s;uch
as you &s;aid the&s;e were; but are &s;carce compatible
with human Nature. They exceed all we ever read
of, among&s;t the <HI>Mingrelians</HI> and <HI>Topinamboues.</HI></P>
<P>HAVE a care, cry'd he, have a care! You are
not aware you are &s;peaking Bla&s;phemy, and are
abu&s;ing your Favourites, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> e&s;pecially the
<HI>Athenians,</HI> whom I have couch'd all along, under
the&s;e bizarre Names I employ'd. If you con&s;ider
aright, there is not one Stroke of the foregoing
<PB N="230" REF="230">
Character, which might not be fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd in the Man of
highe&s;t Merit at <HI>Athens,</HI> without dimini&s;hing, in the
lea&s;t, from the Brightne&s;s of his Character. The <HI>Greek</HI>
Love, their Marriages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Laws of <HI>Athens</HI> allow'd a Man to marry his Si&s;ter by the Father. <HI>Solon</HI>'s Laws forbid Paedera&s;ty to Slaves, as being of too great Dignity for &s;uch mean Per&s;ons.</NOTE>, and the expo&s;ing of their
Children cannot but &s;trike you immediately. The
Death of <HI>Usbek</HI> is an exact Counter-part to that of
<HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P>ALL to a Trifle, &s;ay'd I, interrupting him; you
did not mention, that <HI>Usbek</HI> was an U&s;urper.</P>
<P>I DID not, reply'd he; le&s;t you &s;hould di&s;cover the
Parallel I aim'd at. But even adding this Circum|&s;tance,
we &s;hould make no Scruple, according to our
Sentiments of Morals, to denomitate <HI>Brutus,</HI> and
<HI>Ca&s;&s;ius,</HI> ungrateful Traitors and A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins: Tho' you
know, that they are, perhaps, the highe&s;t Characters
of all Antiquity; and the <HI>Athenians</HI> erected Statues
to them; which they plac'd near tho&s;e of <HI>Harmodius</HI>
and <HI>Ari&s;togiton,</HI> their own Deliverers. And if you
think this Circum&s;tance, you mention, &s;o material
to ab&s;olve the&s;e Patriots, I &s;hall compen&s;ate it by
another, not mention'd, which will equally aggra|vate
their Crime. A few Days before the Execution
<PB N="231" REF="231">
of their fatal Purpo&s;e, they all &s;wore Fealty to
<HI>Cae&s;ar;</HI> and prote&s;ting to hold his Per&s;on ever &s;acred,
they touch'd the Altar with tho&s;e Hands, which they
had already arm'd for his De&s;truction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appian. Bell. Civ. Lib. 3. Suetonius in vita Cae&s;aris.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I NEED not put you in mind of the famous and
applauded Story of <HI>Themi&s;tocles,</HI> and of his Patience
towards <HI>Eurybiades,</HI> the <HI>Spartan,</HI> his commanding
Officer, who, heated by a Debate, lifted his Cane
to him in a Council of War (the &s;ame Thing as if he
had cudgel'd him) <HI>Strike!</HI> Cries the <HI>Athenian, Strike!
but hear me.</HI></P>
<P>YOU are too good a Scholar not to di&s;cover <HI>Socrates</HI>
and his <HI>Athenian</HI> Club in my la&s;t Story; and you
would certainly ob&s;erve, that it is exactly copy'd
from <HI>Xenophon,</HI> with a Variation only of the Names<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mem. Soc. Lib. 3. &s;ub fine.</NOTE>.
And I think I have fairly made appear, that an
<HI>Athenian</HI> Man of Merit might be &s;uch a one as with
us would pa&s;s for Ince&s;tuous, a Parricide, an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in,
an ungrateful, perjur'd Traitor, and &s;omething el&s;e
too abominable to be nam'd; not to mention his
Ru&s;ticity and Ill-manners. And having liv'd in this
Manner, his Death may be entirely &s;uitable: He
<PB N="232" REF="232">
may conclude the Scene by a de&s;perate Act of Self-murder,
and dye with the mo&s;t ab&s;urd Bla&s;phemies
in his Mouth. And notwith&s;tanding all this, he
&s;hall have Statues, if not Altars, erected to his
Memory; Poems and Orations &s;hall be compos'd in
his Prai&s;e; great Sects &s;hall be proud of calling
them&s;elves by his Name; and the mo&s;t di&s;tant Po&s;te|rity
&s;hall blindly continue their Admiration: Tho'
were &s;uch a one to ari&s;e among&s;t them&s;elves, they
would ju&s;tly regard him with Horror and Execra|tion.</P>
<P>I MIGHT have been aware, reply'd I, of your
Artifice. You &s;eem to take Plea&s;ure in this Topic;
and are indeed the only Man I ever knew, who was
well acquainted with the Antients, and did not ex|tremely
admire them. But in&s;tead of attacking their
Philo&s;ophy, their Eloquence, or Poetry, the u&s;ual
Subjects of Controver&s;y betwixt us, you now &s;eem
to impeach their Morals, and accu&s;e them of Igno|rance
in a Science, which is the only one, in my
Opinion, wherein they are not &s;urpa&s;s'd by the Mo|derns.
Geometry, Phy&s;ics, A&s;tronomy, Anatomy,
Botany, Geography, Navigation; in the&s;e we ju&s;tly
claim the Superiority: But what have we to oppo&s;e
to their Morali&s;ts? Your Repre&s;entation of Things
is fallacious. You have no Indulgence for the Man|ners
and Cu&s;toms of different Ages. Would you try
<PB N="233" REF="233">
a <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> by the Common-law of <HI>England?</HI>
Hear him defend him&s;elf by his own Maxims; and
then pronounce.</P>
<P>THERE are no Manners &s;o innocent or rea&s;onable,
which may not be render'd odious or ridiculous, if
mea&s;ur'd by a Standard, unknown to the Per&s;ons;
e&s;pecially, if you employ a little Art or Eloquence,
in aggravating &s;ome Circum&s;tances, and extenuating
others, as be&s;t &s;erves the Purpo&s;e of your Di&s;cour&s;e.
All the&s;e Artifices may ea&s;ily be retorted on you.
Could I inform the <HI>Athenians,</HI> for In&s;tance, there was
a Nation, wherein Adultery, both active and pa&s;&s;ive,
&s;o to &s;peak, was in the highe&s;t Vogue and E&s;teem:
Wherein every Man of Education cho&s;e for his
Mi&s;tre&s;s a marry'd Woman, the Wife, perhaps, of
his Friend and Companion; and valu'd him&s;elf upon
the&s;e infamous Conque&s;ts, as much as if he had been
&s;everal Times a Conqueror in Boxing or Wre&s;tling
at the <HI>Olympic</HI> Games. Wherein every Man, al&s;o,
took a Pride in his Tamene&s;s and Facility with re|gard
to his own Wife, and was glad to make Friends
or gain Intere&s;t by allowing her to pro&s;titute her
Charms; and even, without any &s;uch Motive, gave
her full Liberty and Indulgence. I a&s;k, what Sen|timents
the <HI>Athenians</HI> would entertain of &s;uch a Peo|ple;
they who never mention'd the Crime of Adul|tery
but in Conjunction with Robbery and Poi&s;on|ing?
<PB N="234" REF="234">
Which would they admire mo&s;t, the Villainy
or the Meanne&s;s of &s;uch a Conduct?</P>
<P>SHOULD I add, that the &s;ame People were as proud
of their Slavery and Dependance as the <HI>Athenians</HI>
were of their Liberty; and tho' a Man among them
were oppre&s;t, di&s;grac'd, impoveri&s;h'd, in&s;ulted, or
impri&s;on'd by the Tyrant, he would &s;till regard it as
the highe&s;t Merit to love, &s;erve, and obey him;
and even to die for his &s;malle&s;t Glory or Satisfaction:
The&s;e noble <HI>Greeks</HI> would probably a&s;k me, whether
I &s;poke of a human Society, or of &s;ome inferior,
&s;ervile Species.</P>
<P>'TWAS then I might inform my <HI>Athenian</HI> Audience,
that the&s;e People, however, wanted not Spirit and
Bravery. If a Man, &s;ays I, tho' their intimate
Friend, &s;hould throw out, in a private Company, a
Raillery again&s;t them, nearly approaching any of
tho&s;e, with which your Generals and Demagogues
every Day regale each other, in the Face of the
whole City, they never can forgive him; but in
order to revenge them&s;elves, they oblige him imme|diately
to run them thro' the Body, or be him&s;elf
murder'd. And if a Man, who is an ab&s;olute
Stranger to them, &s;hould de&s;ire them, at the Peril
of their own Life, to cut the Throat of their Bo&s;om-companion&punc;
they immediately obey, and think them|&s;elves
<PB N="235" REF="235">
highly oblig'd and honour'd by the Commi&s;&s;ion.
The&s;e are their Maxims of Honour: This is their
favourite Morality.</P>
<P>BUT tho' &s;o ready to draw their Sword again&s;t
their Friends and Countrymen; no Di&s;grace, no In|famy,
no Pain, no Poverty will ever engage the&s;e
People to turn the Point of it again&s;t their own
Brea&s;t. A Man of Rank would row in the Gallies,
would beg his Bread, would langui&s;h in Pri&s;on,
would &s;uffer any Tortures; and &s;till pre&s;erve his
wretched Life. Rather than e&s;cape his Enemies by
a generous Contempt of Death, he would infamou&s;ly
receive the &s;ame Death from his Enemies, aggra|vated
by their triumphant In&s;ults, and by the mo&s;t
exqui&s;ite Sufferings.</P>
<P>'TIS very u&s;ual too, continu'd I, among&s;t this
People to &s;hut up &s;everal of their Children in a per|petual
Pri&s;on (where every Art of plaguing, and
tormenting them is carefully &s;tudy'd and practis'd)
in order, that another Child, whom they own to
have no greater or rather le&s;s Merit than the re&s;t,
may enjoy their whole Fortune, and wallow in every
Kind of Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s and Plea&s;ure. Nothing &s;o
virtuous in their Opinion as this barbarous Partia|lity.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="236">
BUT what is more particular in this whim&s;ical
Nation, &s;ay I to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> is, that a Frolic of
yours during the <HI>Saturnalia,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Greeks</HI> kept the Fea&s;t of <HI>Saturn</HI> or <HI>Chronus,</HI> as well as the <HI>Romans.</HI> See Lucian. Epi&s;t. Saturn.</NOTE>, when the Slaves
are &s;erv'd by their Ma&s;ters, is &s;eriou&s;ly con|tinu'd
by them thro' the whole Year, and thro' the
whole Cour&s;e of their Lives; and accompany'd too
with &s;ome Circum&s;tances, which &s;till farther augment
the Ab&s;urdity and Ridicule. Your Sport only elevates
for a few Days tho&s;e whom Fortune has thrown
down, and whom &s;he too, in Sport, may really ele|vate
for ever above you: But this Nation gravely
exalt tho&s;e, whom Nature has &s;ubjected to them,
and who&s;e Inferiority and Infirmities are ab&s;olutely
incurable. The Women, tho' without Virtue, are
their Ma&s;ters and Sovereigns: The&s;e they reverence,
prai&s;e, and magnify: To the&s;e, they pay the highe&s;t
Deference and Re&s;pect: And in all Places and at all
Times, the Superiority of the Females is readily
acknowledg'd and &s;ubmitted to by every one, who
has the lea&s;t Preten&s;ions to Education and Politene&s;s.
Scarce any Crime would be &s;o univer&s;ally dete&s;ted
as an Infraction of this Rule.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="237">
YOU need go no farther, reply'd <HI>Palamedes,</HI> I can
ea&s;ily conjecture the People you aim at. The Strokes,
with which you have painted them, are pretty ju&s;t;
and yet you mu&s;t acknowledge, that &s;carce any
People are to be found, either in antient or modern
Times, who&s;e national Character is, upon the Whole,
le&s;s liable to Exceptions. But I give you Thanks for
helping me our with my Argument. I had no In|tention
of exalting the Moderns at the Expence of
the Antients. I only meant to repre&s;ent the Uncer|tainty
of all the&s;e Judgments concerning Characters;
and to convince you, that Fa&s;hion, Vogue, Cu&s;tom,
and Law were the chief Foundation of all moral
Determinations. The <HI>Athenians</HI> &s;urely, were a civi|liz'd,
intelligent People, if ever there was one;
and yet their Man of Merit might, in this Age,
be held in Horror and Execration. The <HI>French</HI> are
al&s;o, without doubt, a very civiliz'd, intelligent
People; and yet their Man of Merit might, with
the <HI>Athenians,</HI> be an Object of the highe&s;t Contempt
and Ridicule, and even Hatred. And what renders
the Matter more extraordinary: The&s;e two national
Characters are &s;uppos'd to be the mo&s;t &s;imilar of any
in antient or modern Times; and while the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
flatter them&s;elves that they re&s;emble the <HI>Romans,</HI>
their Neighbours on the Continent draw the Parallel
betwixt them&s;elves and the&s;e polite <HI>Greeks.</HI> What
<PB N="238" REF="238">
wide Difference, therefore, in the Sentiments of
Morals, mu&s;t be found betwixt civiliz'd Nations and
Barbarians, or betwixt Nations who&s;e Characters
have little in common? How &s;hall we pretend to
fix a Standard for Judgments of this Nature?</P>
<P>BY tracing Matters, reply'd I, a little higher, and
examining the fir&s;t Principles, which each Nation
e&s;tabli&s;hes, of Blame or Cen&s;ure. The <HI>Rhine</HI> flows
North, the <HI>Rhone</HI> South; yet both &s;pring from the
<HI>&s;ame</HI> Mountain, and are al&s;o actuated, in their op|po&s;ite
Directions, by the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Principle of Gravity:
The different Inclinations of the Ground, on which
they run, cau&s;e all the Difference of their Cour&s;es.</P>
<P>IN how many Circum&s;tances would an <HI>Athenian</HI>
and <HI>French</HI> Man of Merit certainly concur? Good-&s;en&s;e,
Knowledge, Wit, Eloquence, Humanity,
Fidelity, Truth, Ju&s;tice, Courage, Temperance,
Con&s;tancy, Dignity of Mind. The&s;e you have all
omitted; in order to in&s;i&s;t only on the Points, in
which they may, by Accident, differ. Very well:
I am willing to comply with you; and &s;hall endea|vour
to account for the&s;e Differences from the mo&s;t
univer&s;al, e&s;tabli&s;h'd Principles of Morals.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Greek</HI> Loves, I care not to examine more par|ticularly.
I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that, however blame|able,
<PB N="239" REF="239">
they aro&s;e from a very innocent Cau&s;e, the
Frequency of the Gymna&s;tic Exerci&s;es among&s;t that

and Fidelity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plat. Symp. P.182. Ex Edit. Serr.</NOTE>; Qualities e&s;teem'd in all Na|tions
and all Ages.</P>
<P>THE Marriage of Half-brothers and Si&s;ters &s;eems
no great Difficulty. Love betwixt the nearer Rela|tions
is contrary to Rea&s;on and public Utility; but
the preci&s;e Point, where we are to &s;top, can &s;carcely
be determin'd by natural Rea&s;on; and is therefore a
very proper Subject of municipal Law or Cu&s;tom.
If the <HI>Athenians</HI> went a little too far on the one Side,
the Canon Law has &s;urely pu&s;h'd Matters a great
way into the other Extremity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Enquiry. Sect. IV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAD you a&s;k'd a Parent at <HI>Athens,</HI> why he bereav'd
his Child of that Life, which he had &s;o lately given
it. 'Tis becau&s;e I love it, he would reply; and re|gard
the Poverty it mu&s;t inherit from me, as a greater
Evil than a Death, which it is not capable of dread|ing,
feeling, or re&s;enting<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plutarch. de amore prolis, &s;ub fine.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HOW is public Liberty, the mo&s;t valuable of all
Ble&s;&s;ings, to be recover'd from the Hands of an
<PB N="240" REF="240">
U&s;urper or Tyrant, if his Power &s;hields him from
public Rebellion, and our Scruples from private
Vengeance? That his Crime is capital by Law, you
acknowledge: And mu&s;t the highe&s;t Aggravation of
his Crime, the putting him&s;elf above Law, form his
full Security? You can reply nothing, but by &s;how|ing
the great Inconveniencies of A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination;
which, could any one have prov'd clearly to the
Antients, he had reform'd their Sentiments in this
Particular.</P>
<P>AGAIN, to ca&s;t your Eye on the Picture I have
drawn of modern Manners; there is almo&s;t as great
Difficulty, I acknowledge, to ju&s;tify <HI>French</HI> as <HI>Greek</HI>
Gallantry; except only, that the former is much
more natural and agreeable than the latter. But our
Neighbours, it &s;eems, have re&s;olv'd to &s;acrifice &s;ome
of the dome&s;tic to the &s;ociable Plea&s;ures; and to
prefer Ea&s;e, Freedom, and an open Commerce to a
&s;trict Fidelity and Con&s;tancy. The&s;e Ends are both
good, and are &s;omewhat difficult to reconcile; nor
need we be &s;urpriz'd, if the Cu&s;toms of Nations en|cline
too much, &s;ometimes to the one Side, &s;ometimes
to the other.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t inviolable Attachment to the Laws of
our Country is every-where acknowledg'd a capital
Virtue; and where the People are not &s;o happy, as
<PB N="241" REF="241">
to have any other Legi&s;lature but a &s;ingle Per&s;on, the
&s;tricte&s;t Loyalty is, in that Ca&s;e, the true&s;t Pa|trioti&s;m.</P>
<P>NOTHING &s;urely can be more ab&s;urd and barbarous
than the Practice of Duelling; but tho&s;e, who
ju&s;tify it, &s;ay, that it begets Civility and Good-man|ners.
And a Dueli&s;t, you may ob&s;erve, always
values him&s;elf upon his Courage, his Sen&s;e of Ho|nour,
his Fidelity and Friend&s;hip; Qualities, which
are here indeed very oddly directed, but have been
e&s;teem'd univer&s;ally, &s;ince the Foundation of the
World.</P>
<P>HAVE the Gods forbid Self-murder? An <HI>Athe|nian</HI>
allows, that it ought to be foreborn. Has the
Deity permitted it? A <HI>Frenchman</HI> allows, that
Death is preferable to Pain and Infamy.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee then, continu'd I, that the Principles,
upon which Men rea&s;on in Morals are always the
&s;ame; tho' the Conclu&s;ions they draw are often very
different. That they all rea&s;on aright with regard to
this Subject, more than with regard to any other, it
is not incumbent on any Morali&s;t to &s;how. 'Tis
&s;ufficient, that the original Principles of Cen&s;ure or
Blame are uniform, and that erroneus Conclu&s;ions
can be corrected by &s;ounder Rea&s;onings and a larger
<PB N="242" REF="242">
Experience. As many Ages as have elaps'd &s;ince
the Fall of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> and &s;uch Changes as
have arriv'd in Religion, Language, Laws, and
Cu&s;toms; none of the&s;e Revolutions has ever pro|duc'd
any con&s;iderable Innovation in the primary
Sentiments of Morals, more than in tho&s;e of external
Beauty. Some minute Differences, perhaps, may
be ob&s;erv'd in both. <HI>Horace</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. Lib. 1. Epi&s;t. 7. Al&s;o Lib. 1. Ode 3.</NOTE> celebrates a low Fore|head,

<P>SOMETIMES Men differ in their Judgment about
the U&s;efulne&s;s of any Habit or Action: Sometimes
al&s;o the peculiar Circum&s;tances of Things render one

celebrated than the pacific, and attract more the Ad|miration

<P>DIFFERENT Cu&s;toms have al&s;o &s;ome Influence,
as well as different Utilities; and by giving an early
Bia&s;s to the Mind, may produce a &s;uperior Propen|&s;ity,
either to the u&s;eful or the agreeable Qualities; to
<PB N="245" REF="245">
tho&s;e, which regard Self, or tho&s;e, which extend to
Society. The&s;e four Sources of moral Sentiment

<P>THE Cu&s;toms of &s;ome Nations &s;hut up the Women
from all &s;ocial Commerce: Tho&s;e of others make
them &s;o e&s;&s;ential a Part of Society and Conver&s;ation,
that, except where Bu&s;ine&s;s is canva&s;s'd, the Male-&s;ex
alone are &s;uppos'd ab&s;olutely incapable of mutual
Di&s;cour&s;e and Entertainment. As this Difference is
the mo&s;t material, that can happen in private Life,
it mu&s;t al&s;o produce the greate&s;t Variation in our
moral Sentiments.</P>
<P>OF all Nations in the World, where Polygamy
was not allow'd, the <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;eem to have been the
mo&s;t re&s;erv'd in their Commerce with the Fair-&s;ex,
and to have impos'd on them the &s;tricte&s;t Laws of
Mode&s;ty and Decency. We have a &s;trong In&s;tance
of this in an Oration of <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orat. 33.</NOTE>. A Widow injur'd,
ruin'd, undone, calls a Meeting of a few of her neare&s;t
Friends and Relations; and tho' never before ac|cu&s;tom'd,
&s;ays the Orator, to &s;peak in the Pre&s;ence
of Men, the Di&s;tre&s;s of her Circum&s;tances con&s;train'd
<PB N="246" REF="246">
her to lay the Ca&s;e before them. Her very Opening
her Mouth in &s;uch Company requir'd, it &s;eems, an
Apology.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> pro&s;ecuted his Tutors, to make
them refund his Patrimony, it became nece&s;&s;ary for
him, in the Cour&s;e of the Law &s;uit, to prove that
the Marriage of <HI>Aphobus</HI>'s Si&s;ter with <HI>Oneter</HI> was en|tirely
fraudulent, and that, notwith&s;tanding her
Sham-marriage, &s;he had liv'd with her Brother at
<HI>Athens</HI> for two Years la&s;t pa&s;t, ever &s;ince her Divorce
from her former Hu&s;band. And 'tis remarkable,
that tho' the&s;e were People of the fir&s;t Fortune and
Di&s;tinction in the City, the Orator could prove this
Fact no Way, but by calling for her female Slaves
to be put to the Que&s;tion, and by the Evidence of
one Phy&s;ician, who had &s;een her in her Brother's
Hou&s;e during her Illne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Oneterem.</NOTE>. So re&s;erv'd were <HI>Greek</HI>
Manners.</P>
<P>WE may be certain, that an extreme Purity was
the Con&s;equence of this Re&s;erve. Accordingly, we
find, that, except the fabulous Stories of an <HI>Helen</HI>
and a <HI>Clytemne&s;tra,</HI> there &s;carce is an In&s;tance of any
Event in the <HI>Greek</HI> Hi&s;tory, that proceeded from the
Intrigues of Women. On the other hand, in modern
<PB N="247" REF="247">
Times, particularly in a neighbouring Nation, the
Females enter into all Tran&s;actions and all Manage|ment
of Church and State; and no Man can &s;uc|ceed,
who takes not care to obtain their good Graces.
<HI>Harry</HI> the third, by incurring the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the
Fair, endanger'd his Crown, and lo&s;t his Life, as
much as by his Indulgence to Here&s;y.</P>
<P>'TIS needle&s;s to di&s;&s;emble: The Con&s;equence of a
very free Commerce betwixt the Sexes, and of their
living much together, will often terminate in In|trigues
and Gallantry. We mu&s;t &s;acrifice &s;omewhat
of the <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> if we be very anxious to obtain all the
<HI>agreeable</HI> Qualities; and cannot pretend to reach alike
every Kind of Advantage. In&s;tances of Licence,
daily multiplying, will weaken the Scandal with the
one Sex, and teach the other, by Degrees, to adopt
the famous Maxim of <HI>la Fontaine,</HI> with regard to
female Infidelity, <HI>that if one knows it, it is but a &s;mall
Matter; if one knows it not, it is nothing</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Quand on le &s;&ccedil;ait c'e&s;t peu de cho&s;e:</L>
<L>Quand on ne le &s;&ccedil;ait pas, ce n'e&s;t rien.</L></NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME People are inclin'd to think, that the be&s;t
Way of adju&s;ting all Differences, and of keeping
the proper Medium betwixt the <HI>agreeable</HI> and <HI>u&s;eful</HI>
Qualities of the Sex is to live with them after the
<PB N="248" REF="248">
Manner of the <HI>Romans</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> (for the

They were call'd <HI>Ancillarioli.</HI> See Seneca de Beneficiis. Lib. 1. Cap. 9. See al&s;o Martial, Lib. 12.

Jealou&s;y. By a Parity of Rea&s;on, the Cu&s;toms of
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and of the <HI>Italians</HI> of an Age ago (for
the pre&s;ent are very different) mu&s;t be the wor&s;t of
any; becau&s;e they favour both Gallantry and Jea|lou&s;y.</P>
<P>NOR will the&s;e different Cu&s;toms of Nations affect
only the one Sex: The Idea of per&s;onal Merit in
the Males mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;omewhat different, with re|gard,
at lea&s;t, to Conver&s;ation, Addre&s;s, and Hu|mour.
The one Nation, where the Men live much
apart, will naturally more e&s;teem Prudence; the
other, Gaiety: With the one, Simplicity of Man|ners
will be in the highe&s;t Re&s;pect; with the other,
Politene&s;s. The one will di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by
<PB N="249" REF="249">
Good-&s;en&s;e and Judgment; the other, by Ta&s;te and
Delicacy: The Eloquence of the former will &s;hine
mo&s;t in the Senate; that of the other, on the The|atre.</P>
<P>THESE, I &s;ay, are the <HI>natural</HI> Effects of &s;uch
Cu&s;toms. For it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, that Chance has a
great Influence on national Manners; and many Events
happen in Society, which are not to be accounted
for by general Rules. Who could imagine, for
In&s;tance, that the <HI>Romans,</HI> who liv'd freely with their
Women, &s;hould be very indifferent about Mu&s;ic,
and e&s;teem Dancing infamous: While the <HI>Greeks,</HI>
who never almo&s;t &s;aw a Woman but in their own
Hou&s;es, were continually piping, &s;inging, and danc|ing?</P>
<P>THE Differences of moral Sentiment, which na|turally
ari&s;e from a republican or monarchical Go|vernment,
are al&s;o very obvious; as well as tho&s;e,
which proceed from general Riches or Poverty,
Union or Faction, Ignorance or Learning. I &s;hall
conclude this long Di&s;cour&s;e with ob&s;erving, that
different Cu&s;toms and Situations vary the original
Ideas of Merit (however they may, &s;ome Con&s;e|quences)
in no very e&s;&s;ential Point, and prevail
chiefly with regard to young Men, who can a&s;pire
<PB N="250" REF="250">
to the agreeable Qualities, and may attempt to plea&s;e,
The MANNER, the ORNAMENTS, the
GRACES, that &s;ucceed in this Shape, are more
arbitrary and ca&s;ual: But the Merit of riper Years is
almo&s;t every-where the &s;ame; and con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in
Integrity, Humanity, Ability, Knowledge and the
other more &s;olid and u&s;eful Qualities of the human
Mind.</P>
<P>WHAT you in&s;i&s;t on, reply'd <HI>Palamedes,</HI> may have
&s;ome Foundation, when you &s;tick to the Maxims of
common Life and ordinary Conduct. Experience
and the Practice of the World readily correct any
great Extravagance on either Side. But what &s;ay
you to <HI>artificial</HI> Lives and Manners? How do you
reconcile the Maxims, on which the&s;e are founded?</P>
<P>WHAT do you under&s;tand by <HI>artificial</HI> Lives and
Manners, &s;aid I? I explain my&s;elf, reply'd he.
You know, that Religion had, in antient Times'
very little Influence on common Life, and that,
after Men had perform'd their Duty in Sacrifices and
Prayers at the Temple, they thought, that the Gods
left the re&s;t of their Conduct to them&s;elves, and were
little pleas'd, or offended with tho&s;e Virtues and
Vices, that only affected the Peace and Happine&s;s of
human Society. In tho&s;e Ages, 'twas the Bu&s;ine&s;s
of Philo&s;ophy alone to regulate Men's ordinary Be|haviour
<PB N="251" REF="251">
and Deportment; and accordingly, we may
ob&s;erve, that this being the &s;ole Principle, by which
a Man could elevate him&s;elf above his Fellows, it
acquir'd a mighty A&s;cendant over many, and pro|duc'd
great Singularities of Maxims and of Con|duct.
At pre&s;ent, that Philo&s;ophy has lo&s;t the Al|lurement
of Novelty, it has no &s;uch exten&s;ive Influ|ence;
but &s;eems to confine it&s;elf mo&s;tly to Specula|tions
in the Clo&s;et; in the &s;ame Manner, as the an|tient
Religion was limited to Sacrifices in the Tem|ple.
Its Place is now &s;upply'd by the modern Reli|gion,
which in&s;pects our whole Conduct, and pre|&s;cribes
an univer&s;al Rule to our Actions, to our
Words, to our very Thoughts and Inclinations; a
Rule &s;o much the more au&s;tere, that it is guarded by
infinite, tho' di&s;tant. Rewards and Puni&s;hments;
and no Infraction of it can ever be conceal'd or di&s;|guis'd.</P>
<P><HI>DIOGENES</HI> is the mo&s;t celebrated Model of
extravagant Philo&s;ophy. Let us &s;eek a Parallel to
him in modern Times. We &s;hall not di&s;grace any
philo&s;ophic Name by a Compari&s;on with the <HI>Domi|nics</HI>
or <HI>Loyolas,</HI> or any canoniz'd Monk or Friar.
Let us compare him to <HI>Pa&s;cal,</HI> a Man of Parts and
Genius as well as <HI>Diogenes</HI> him&s;elf; and perhaps too,
<PB N="252" REF="252">
a Man of Virtue, had he allow'd his virtuous Incli|nations
to have exerted and di&s;play'd them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE Foundation of <HI>Diogenes</HI>'s Conduct was to
render him&s;elf an independent Being as much as
po&s;&s;ible, and to confine all his Wants and De&s;ires and
Plea&s;ures within him&s;elf and his own Mind: The
Aim of <HI>Pa&s;cal</HI> was to keep a perpetual Sen&s;e of his
Dependance before his Eyes, and never to forget his
numberle&s;s Wants and Nece&s;&s;ities. The Antient
&s;upported him&s;elf by Magnanimity, O&s;tentation,
Pride, and the Idea of his own Superiority above
his Fellow-creatures. The Modern made con&s;tant
Profe&s;&s;ion of Humility and Aba&s;ement, of the Con|tempt
and Hatred of him&s;elf; and endeavour'd to
attain the&s;e &s;uppos'd Virtues, as far as they are at|tainable.
The Au&s;terities of the <HI>Greek</HI> were in order
to inure him&s;elf to Hard&s;hips, and prevent his ever
&s;uffering: Tho&s;e of the <HI>Frenchman</HI> were embrac'd
merely for their own Sake, and in order to &s;uffer as
much as po&s;&s;ible. The Philo&s;opher indulg'd him&s;elf in
the mo&s;t bea&s;tly Plea&s;ures, even in public: The Saint
refus'd him&s;elf the mo&s;t innocent, even in private:
The former thought it his Duty to love his Friends,
and to rail at them, and reprove them, and &s;cold
them: The latter endeavour'd to be ab&s;olutely in|different
towards his neare&s;t Relations, and to love
and &s;peak well of his Enemies. The great Object
<PB N="253" REF="253">
of <HI>Diogenes</HI>'s Wit was every Kind of Super&s;tition,
that is, every Kind of Religion known in his Time.
The Mortality of the Soul was his Standard Prin|ciple;
and even his Sentiments of a Divine Provi|dence
&s;eem to have been very licentious. The mo&s;t
ridiculous Super&s;titions directed <HI>Pa&s;cal</HI>'s Faith and
Practice; and an extreme Contempt of this Life, in
Compari&s;on of the future, was the chief Foundation
of his Conduct.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch a remarkable Contra&s;t do the&s;e two Men
&s;tand: Yet both of them have met with univer&s;al
Admiration in their different Ages, and have been
propos'd as Models of Imitation. Where then is
the univer&s;al Standard of Morals, which you talk
of? And what Rule &s;hall we e&s;tabli&s;h for the many
different, nay contrary Sentiments of Mankind?</P>
<P>AN Experiment, &s;aid I, that &s;ucceeds in the Air,
will not always &s;ucceed in a Vacuum. When Men
depart from the Maxims of common Rea&s;on, and
affect the&s;e <HI>artificial</HI> Lives, as you call them, no-one
can an&s;wer for what will plea&s;e or di&s;plea&s;e them.
They are in a different Element from the re&s;t of
Mankind; and the natural Principles of their Mind
play not with the &s;ame Regularity, as if left to them|&s;elves,
free from the Illu&s;ions of religious Super&s;tition
or philo&s;ophical Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
