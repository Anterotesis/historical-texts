<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following ODES were written at very
di&s;tant intervals, and with a view to very
different manners of expre&s;&s;ion and ver&s;ification.
The author pretends chiefly to the merit of en|deavouring
to be correct, and of carefully attend|ing
to the be&s;t models. From what the ancients
have left of this kind, perhaps the ODE may be
allow'd the mo&s;t amiable &s;pecies of poetry; but
certainly there is none which in modern langua|ges
has been generally attempted with &s;o little
&s;ucce&s;s. For the perfection of lyric poetry de|pends,
beyond that of any other, on the beauty
of words and the gracefulne&s;s of numbers; in both
which re&s;pects the ancients had infinite advan|tages
above us. A con&s;ideration which will alle|viate
the author's di&s;appointment, if he too &s;hould
be found to have mi&s;carried.</P>
