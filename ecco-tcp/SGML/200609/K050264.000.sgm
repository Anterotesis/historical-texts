<HEAD>AN
ANSWER
TO A
QUESTION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THAT we are to have a Peace, or,
That the Peace is made, What
&s;ort of Peace, or How it has
been brought about; the&s;e are
Que&s;tions the World begins to have done
with, they have been &s;o much, &s;o often,
and to &s;o little purpo&s;e banded about, and
to&s;s'd like a Shuttlecock, from one Party
to another; the Parties them&s;elves begin
to want Breath to rail and throw Scandal.
<HI>Roper</HI> and <HI>Ridpath,</HI> like two <HI>Tom T&mdash;men,</HI>
have thrown Night-Dirt at one another
&s;o long, and grop'd into &s;o many Jakes's
up to their Elbows to find it, that they
&s;tink now in the No&s;trils of their own
Party. They are become perfectly nau|&s;eous
to read; the Nation is &s;urfeited
of them, and the People begin to be tired
<PB N="4" REF="3">
with ill u&s;ing one another. Would any
tolerable Face appear upon things, we
might expect the People would be inclin|ed
to be ea&s;ie; and were the Eyes of &s;ome
Great Men open, they may &s;ee this was
the Opportunity they never had before, to
make the Nation ea&s;ie, and them&s;elves
&s;afe. The main thing which agitates the
Minds of Men now, is the Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
and the Pretender. Much Pains
have been taken on both &s;ides to amu&s;e
the World about this remaining Di&s;pute;
one &s;ide to make us believe it is &s;afe, and
the other to convince us it is in Danger.
Neither &s;ide hath been able to expatiate
upon the Part they affirm. Tho&s;e who
&s;ay, the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion is &s;ecure,
have not yet &s;hewn us any Step taken
&s;ince the&s;e New Tran&s;actions, for its
particular Security. Tho&s;e who &s;ay it is
in danger, have not &s;o clearly determined
even among them&s;elves, from what par|ticular
Head of Publick Management that
Danger chiefly proceeds. Both the&s;e Un|certainties
&s;erve to perplex us, and to
leave the thing more undetermined than
con&s;i&s;ts with the publick Ea&s;e of the
Peoples Minds. To contribute &s;omething
to that Ea&s;e, and bring tho&s;e who&s;e Place
it is, to con&s;ider of Ways to make the
People ea&s;ie in this Ca&s;e, this Work is
<PB N="5" REF="4">
made Publick. Po&s;&s;ibly the Que&s;tion pro|pounded
may not meet with a Categorical
An&s;wer. But this is certain, it &s;hall &s;hew
you more Directly what is the chief
Que&s;tion which the &s;ub&s;tance of Things
before us is like to turn upon; and to
which all our Que&s;tions &s;eem to Tend.
Were the great Difficulty of the Succe&s;&s;i|on
brought to a narrow Compa&s;s, tho'
we might &s;pend fewer Words about it, we
&s;hould &s;ooner come to a direct An&s;wer.
Before I come to the Great and chief
Que&s;tion upon which this Affair &s;o much
&s;eems to Turn, it &s;eems needful to put the
previous Que&s;tion upon which &s;o much
Debate has been among us, and let that be
Examined. This previous Que&s;tion is this:
Is there any real Danger of the Prote&s;tant
Succe&s;&s;ion? Is there any Danger that the
Pretender &s;hall be brought in upon us?
Is there any Danger of Popery, and Ty|ranny
by Re&s;toring the Son, <HI>as they call
him,</HI> of Abdicated King <HI>James?</HI> This is
the previous Que&s;tion, as we may now
call it. It is well known that there are
&s;ome People among us, who are &s;o far
from allowing that there is any &s;uch Dan|ger,
as the &s;aid Que&s;tion mentions, that
they will have it be a Token of Di&s;affecti|on
to the Government to put the Que&s;ti|on;
and are for loading whoever &s;hall
<PB N="6" REF="5">
offer to Start &s;uch a Que&s;tion, with Cha|racters,
and Patry-Marks odious to good
Men; &s;uch as Incendiary, Promoter of
Di&s;contents, Rai&s;er of Faction, Divider of
the People, and the like: Names which
the Writer of the&s;e Sheets, at the &s;ame
time, both contemns and abhors. He can|not
&s;ee that he is any Enemy to the
Queen, in Inquiring as diligently as po&s;&s;i|ble,
whether there are any Attempts to
Depo&s;e Her, or dangerous Pro&s;pects of
bringing in the hated Rival of Her Glory
and Dominion. It is &s;o far from that, that
it is apparently the Duty of every true
Subject of Her Maje&s;ty, to Inquire &s;e|riou&s;ly,
whether the publick Peace, the
Queen's Safety, Her Throne, or Her Per|&s;on
is in any Danger from the wicked De|&s;ign
of Her, and Her Peoples Enemies.
Wherefore, and for the joint Concern eve|ry
Prote&s;tant <HI>Britain,</HI> has in this thing;
I &s;hall make no Difficulty, plainly and &s;eri|ou&s;ly
to State, and to An&s;wer this previous
Que&s;tion, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Whether there is any
Danger of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, from
the pre&s;ent Mea&s;ures, and from the pre|&s;ent
People concern'd? I am not igno|rant
of what has been &s;aid by &s;ome, to
prove that the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try cannot be
&s;u&s;pected of having any View to the Pre|tender
in any of their Mea&s;ures. The
<PB N="7" REF="6">
be&s;t Rea&s;on which I have &s;een given upon
that Subject, is, that it is not their Inte|re&s;t;
and that as we have not found them
Fools that are blind to their own Intere&s;t;
that either do not under&s;tand, or pur&s;ue
it. This we find handled &s;undry ways,
by &s;undry Authors, and very much In&s;i|&s;ted
upon as a Foundation &s;or us to build
upon. We &s;hall give our Thoughts upon
it with plainne&s;s, and without Fear, or Fa|vour.
Good Manners requires we &s;hould
&s;peak of the Mini&s;try with all due regard
to their Character and Per&s;ons. This is a
Tract, de&s;ign'd to Inquire &s;eriou&s;ly of a
Weighty and E&s;&s;ential, not a trifling
Thing, which requires but a trifling Ex|amination;
nor &s;hall it be handled here
with Satyr and Scurrility. We Approve
neither of the Flatteries of one &s;ide, or
the In&s;ultings of the other. We &s;hall
readily and mo&s;t willingly Joyn with tho&s;e
who are of Opinion, that it is not the In|tere&s;t
of the Mini&s;try to be for the Pre|tender;
and that the Mini&s;try are not
blind to, or carele&s;s of their own Intere&s;t;
and Con&s;equently, that the Mini&s;try can|not
be for the Pretender. This I hope
may be called a direct An&s;wer. When I
&s;ay, <HI>Cannot,</HI> I mu&s;t not, be under&s;tood po|tentially,
that they have no Moral Capacity;
But they cannot without &s;uch Incon|&s;i&s;tencies,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Contradictions and Improbable
things happening in, which render it
highly Irrational, &s;o much us to &s;uppo&s;e
it of them. To &s;hut the Door again&s;t any
po&s;&s;ibility of Cavil, It may be needful al|&s;o
to take it with us as we go, what we
mean by the Words <HI>be for</HI> the Pretender;
and this can be no otherwi&s;e under&s;tood,
than to have a De&s;ign however remote,
and upon whatever Views to bring him in
to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Throne of the&s;e Kingdoms.
The matter then being laid down thus, as
&s;incerely and plainly as po&s;&s;ible; we
come to the Que&s;tion point-blank, and
think it our Duty to &s;ay with the greate&s;t
Sincerity, that we do not believe the
Mini&s;try are in any Kind, or with any
Pro&s;pect near, or remote, Acting for, or
with a De&s;ign or View to bring in the
Pretender. Having granted this, we mu&s;t
however, to prevent any Breaking in by
way of Cavil on one Hand, or Triumph
on the other; &s;ubjoyn immediately, that
we do not in the lea&s;t Grant by this, that
the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion is in no Danger,
even from &s;everal of the Mea&s;ures now
taken in the World. It is far from any
Reflection upon the Mini&s;try, to &s;ay, that
however they may Act upon a right
&s;incere Principle for the Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
in all they do, which, as above
<PB N="9" REF="8">
we profe&s;s to believe. Yet that many of
the Tools they make u&s;e of, are of an|other
Make, and have no Edge to cut
any other way; no Thoughts to move
them towards any other End; no other
Center, which they can have any Tenden|cy
to; that the Pretender's Intere&s;t is the
Magnet, which draws them by its &s;ecret
Influence, to point to him as their Pole;
that they have their Aim at his E&s;tabli&s;h|ment
here, and own it to be their Aim:
And as they are not Shy to pro&s;e&s;s it a|mong
them&s;elves; &s;o their Conduct in
many things makes it &s;ufficiently publick.
This is not meant as any Reflection upon
the Mini&s;try, for making u&s;e of &s;uch
Men: The late Mini&s;try did the &s;ame, and
every Mini&s;try will, and mu&s;t Employ Men
&s;ometimes, not as they always Joyn with
them in their politic Principles; but
as either the Men are found u&s;eful in
their &s;everal Employments, or as the Mi|ni&s;try
may be under other Circum&s;tances,
which makes it Nece&s;&s;ary to them to Em|ploy
them. Nor, as the <HI>Review</HI> well e|nough
ob&s;erv'd, does it follow that <HI>becau&s;e
the Mini&s;try have Employ'd, or Joyn'd with</HI>
Jacobites <HI>in the publick Affairs, that there|fore
they mu&s;t have done it with a</HI> Jacobite
<HI>Principle.</HI> But let the Mini&s;try Employ
the&s;e Men by what Nece&s;&s;ity, or upon what
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Occa&s;ion they will, tho' it may not fol|low
that the Mini&s;try are therefore for <HI>the
Pretender,</HI> yet it does not al&s;o follow that
there is no Danger of the Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
from the Employing tho&s;e &s;ort of
People: <HI>For what if the Queen &s;hould
Die?</HI></P>
<P>The Mini&s;try, it is hoped, are E&s;tabli&s;hed
in the Intere&s;t of their Queen and Coun|try;
and therefore it has been Argued, that
&s;uppo&s;ing the Mini&s;try had the Pretender
in their Eye, yet that it is Irrational to
&s;ugge&s;t that they can have any &s;uch View
during the Life of Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty.
Nay, even tho&s;e profe&s;t <HI>Jacobites,</HI> who
we &s;poke of ju&s;t now, cannot be &s;o un|grateful
to think of Depo&s;ing the Queen,
who has been &s;o Bountiful, &s;o Kind, &s;o
exceeding Good to them, as in &s;everal
Ca&s;es to &s;uffer them to be brought into
the Management of Her own Affairs,
when by their Character they might have
been thought Dangerous, even to Her Per|&s;on&punc;
thus Winning and Engaging them
by Her Bounty, and the Confidence that
has been plac'd in them, not to Attempt
any thing to Her prejudice, without the
mo&s;t Mon&s;trous Ingratitude, without fly|ing
in the Face of all that Sen&s;e of Hon|nor
and Obligation which it is po&s;&s;ible
for Men of common Sen&s;e to entertain.
<PB N="11" REF="10">
And it can hradly be thought, that even Pa|pi&s;ts
them&s;elves under the highe&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons
of their Religious Zeal, can Conquer
the Native Aver&s;ions they mu&s;t have to
&s;uch abominable Ingratitude, or to think
of bringing in the Pretender upon this
Prote&s;tant Nation, even while the Queen
&s;hall be on the Throne. But tho' this
may, <HI>and &s;ome doubt that al&s;o,</HI> tye up their
Hands during the Queen's Life, yet they
them&s;elves give us but &s;mall Rea&s;on to
expect any thing from them afterward;
and it will be hard to find any body to
Vouch for them then. The&s;e very <HI>Jaco|bites,
Papi&s;ts,</HI> and profe&s;t Enemies to the
Revolution may be &s;uppo&s;ed upon the&s;e
Pretentions to be Quiet, and offer no
Violence to the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment
while Her Maje&s;ty has the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and
while that Life la&s;ts, to which they are &s;o
much Indebted for Her Royal Goodne&s;s
and Clemency. <HI>But what would they do, if
the Queen &s;hould die?</HI></P>
<P>Come we next to the <HI>French King.</HI> We
are told, that not the <HI>French King</HI> only, but
even the whole <HI>French Nation</HI> are wonder|fully
forward to acknowledge the Obli|gation
they are under, to the Ju&s;tice and
Favour which they have Received from
Her Maje&s;ty, in the putting an End to

the War; a War which lay Heavy upon
them, and Threaten'd the very Name of
the <HI>French Nation</HI> with Ruin, and much
more Threatn'd the Glory of the <HI>French
Court,</HI> and of their Great Monarch with
an entire Overthrow, a total Eclip&s;e. A
War, which by their own Confe&s;&s;ion, it was
Impo&s;&s;ible for them long to have &s;upported
the Expences of, and which by the great
Superiority of the <HI>Allies,</HI> became Dread|ful
to them, and that every Campaign
more than other; a War which they were
in &s;uch Pain to &s;ee the End of, that they
tried all the Powers and Courts in Chri&s;ten|dom,
who were the lea&s;t Neutral, to
Engage a Mediation in order to a Treaty,
and all in vain; and a War, which if Her
Maje&s;ty had not Enclin'd to put an End
to, mu&s;t have Ended perhaps to the
Di&s;advantage, and Confu&s;ion of both
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> if not of all Chri&s;ten|dom.
The Obligations the <HI>French</HI> are
under for the bringing this War to &s;o ju&s;t
and Honourable a Conclu&s;ion, are not at
all Concealed. Nay, the <HI>Freuch</HI> them|&s;elves
have not been backward to make
them publick. The Declarations made by
the <HI>Freuch King</HI> of his Sincerity in the
Overtures made for a General Peace, the
Prote&s;tations of his being re&s;olved to Enter
into an entire Confidence, and a League
<PB N="13" REF="14">
Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive with the Queen's
Maje&s;ty, for the Pre&s;ervation of the Peace
of Chri&s;tendom, his Recognition of Her
Maje&s;ty's ju&s;t Right to the Crown, his
entring into Articles to pre&s;erve the U|nion,
acknowledging the Ninth Electo|rate
in favour of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI>
and joining in the Great Affair of the
Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion. As the&s;e all con|vince
the World of the Nece&s;&s;ity his
Affairs were reduced to, and the great
Advantages accruing to him by a Peace;
&s;o they &s;eem to be &s;o many Arguments
again&s;t our Fears of the <HI>French</HI> entring
into any Engagements again&s;t the Crown
of <HI>Britain,</HI> much le&s;s any again&s;t the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Queen during her Life.
Not that the Honour and Sincerity of
the King of <HI>France</HI> is a Foundation fit
for her Maje&s;ty or her People to have
any Dependance upon; and the Fraction
of Former Treaties by that Court when
the Glory of that Monarch, or his
particular Views of things has dictated
&s;uch Opportunity to him as he thought
fit to clo&s;e with, are due Cautions to us
all not to have any Dependance of that
kind. But the State of his Affairs, and
the Condition the War has reduced
him to, may give us &s;ome Ground to think
our &s;elves &s;afe on that &s;ide. He knows
<PB N="14" REF="15">
what Power he has taken off from his Ene|mies
in making Peace with Her Maje&s;ty;
he knows very well with what lo&s;s he &s;its
down, how his Affairs are weaken'd, and
what need he has to take Breath after &s;o
terrible a War; be&s;ides the Flame &s;uch an
Action would kindle again in <HI>Europe;</HI>
how it would Animate this whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Nation again&s;t him, in &s;uch a manner, and
Endanger bringing in a new War, and per|haps
a new Confederacy upon him &s;o vio|lently,
and that before he would be in
a Condition to Match them; that no one
can rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>French</HI> King will
run the hazard of it. And the&s;e things may
Tend to make &s;ome People ea&s;ier than or|dinary
in the Affair of the Succe&s;&s;ion; be|lieving
that the <HI>French</HI> King &s;tands in
too much need of the Favour of the Queen
of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who&s;e Power it well be|hoves
him to keep in Friend&s;hip with him,
and who&s;e Nation he will be very Cautious
of provoking a third time, as he has already
done twice to his fatal Experience. All
the&s;e things, we &s;ay, may &s;eem pretty well
to a&s;&s;ure us that nothing is to be feared on
that &s;ide &s;o long as Her Maje&s;ty lives to &s;it
upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne. But all leaves
our Grand Que&s;tion unan&s;wered; and tho'
we may Argue &s;trongly for the <HI>French</HI>
King's Conduct while the pre&s;ent Reign
<PB N="15" REF="16">
continues, yet few will &s;ay, <HI>What he will
do if the Queen &s;hould die?</HI></P>
<P>Nay, we may even mention the <HI>Preten|der</HI>
him&s;elf, if he has any about him who&s;e
Councils are fit to be Depended upon, and
can Direct him to make a Wi&s;e and prudent
Judgment of his own Affairs; if he Acts by
any Scope of Policy, and can take his Mea|&s;ures
with any fore&s;ight; mo&s;t ea&s;ie it is
for them to &s;ee that it mu&s;t be in vain for
him to think of making any Attempt in
<HI>Britain,</HI> during the Life of the Queen;
or to expect to De&s;po&s;e Her Maje&s;ty, and
&s;et him&s;elf up. The <HI>French</HI> Power, upon
which he has already in vain Depended, as
it has not hitherto been able to &s;erve him,
or, his Father; but that their Exile has
continued now above Twenty four Years.
So much le&s;s can he be able to A&s;&s;i&s;t him
now while he has been brought as it were
to Kneel to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court, to put an
End for him to this cruel de&s;tructive War;
The Rea&s;on is ju&s;t &s;poken to, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
this would be to rekindle that Flame, which
he has gotten &s;o lately Quenched, and
which Co&s;t him &s;o much Art, &s;o much
Management, &s;o much Submi&s;&s;ion to the
<HI>Allies</HI> to Endeavour the Quenching of
before. To Attack the Queen of <HI>Great
Britain</HI> now in behalf of the <HI>Pretender,</HI>
would not only be in the highe&s;t Degree
<PB N="16" REF="17">
Ungrateful, Perfidious, and Di&s;honourable;
but would for ever make the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court
as well as the whole Nation, his Violent
and Implacable Enemies; but would al&s;o
Involve him again in a new War with all
<HI>Europe,</HI> who would very gladly Fall in
again with <HI>Britain</HI> to pull down more
Effectually the <HI>French</HI> Power, which has
&s;o long been a Terror to its Neighbours.
So that the <HI>Pretender</HI> can Expect no Help
from the King of <HI>France.</HI> As to what the
<HI>Pope,</HI> the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and a few petty <HI>Popi&s;h</HI>
Powers, who might pretend upon a Re|ligious
pro&s;pect to A&s;&s;i&s;t him, and with
who&s;e Aid, and the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Party
here, he may think fit to hazard an At|tempt
here for the Crown; it is Evident,
and his own Friends will agree in it, that
while the Queen lives, it is Non&s;cence, and
Ridiculous for them to Attempt it; that it
would immediately Arm the whole Nati|on
again&s;t them, as one Man; and in
Humane probability, it would; like as
his &s;uppo&s;ed Father was &s;erv'd at the Re|volution
be the Ruin of his whole Intere&s;t,
and blow him at once quite out of the
Nation. I believe that there are
very few who Alarm them&s;elves much
with the Fears of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> from the
Apprehen&s;ion of his own &s;trength from
Abroad, or from his own Party and Friends
<PB N="17" REF="18">
at Home here, were they once &s;ure that
he &s;hould receive no A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the
King of <HI>France.</HI> If then the King of <HI>France</HI>
cannot be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed either to be
Inclin'd, or be in a Conditon to Appear
for him, or Act in his behalf during the
Life of the Queen; neither can the Pre|tender,
<HI>&s;ay &s;ome,</HI> unle&s;s he is re&s;olved to
Ruin all his Friends, and at la&s;t to Ruin
him&s;elf, make any Attempt of that Kind
during Her Maje&s;ty's Life. <HI>But what if
the Queen &s;hould die?</HI></P>
<P>Having then View'd the &s;everal Points
of the Nation's Compa&s;s, whence our Dan|ger
of <HI>Jacobite</HI> Plots, and Projects again&s;t
the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion may be expected
to come; Let us now Enquire a little of
the State of the Nation, that we make a
right E&s;timate of our Condition, and may
know what to tru&s;t to in Ca&s;es of Diffi|culty,
as they lye before us. In doing
this, as well to avoid giving offence to the
People now in Power, as to the Entring
into the Quarrels which Engage the pre|&s;ent
contending Parties in this Divided
Nation; we &s;hall allow, however &s;ome
may think fit to Que&s;tion it, the main De|bate;
and Grant this for the pre&s;ent as a
Fundamental, (<HI>viz.) That we are in no
Danger</HI> of the Pretender, <HI>during this Queen's
Reign,</HI> or <HI>during this Mini&s;try's Admini|&s;tration
<PB N="18" REF="19">
under Her Maje&s;ty;</HI> and avoiding
all Contention of that Kind, &s;hall allow
our Condition to be <HI>SAFE</HI> in every Ar|ticle
as we go along, <HI>for &s;o long as the Queen
Lives,</HI> referring the Ob&s;ervation of things
in every Head, to tho&s;e who can An&s;wer
the main Que&s;tion in our Title, (<HI>viz.) But
what if the Queen &s;hould die?</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all, it may be Noticed, that
the pre&s;ent Safety of this Nation, whe|ther
we re&s;pect Liberty, Religion, Pro|perty,
or publick Safety and Pro&s;perity,
Depends upon this one Fundamental,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) That <HI>alluding reverently to that Text
of Scripture,</HI> we are all built upon the
Foundation of the late Revolution, <HI>E&s;ta|bli&s;ht
Law</HI> and <HI>Right,</HI> being the <HI>chief
Corner-Stone.</HI> By this it is, that Her
Maje&s;ty is made our Queen, the Entail of
the Crown being re&s;erv'd in the remain|der
to Her Maje&s;ty in the Act of Settle|ment
made at the filling up the vacant
Throne, and by all tho&s;e &s;ub&s;equent Acts,
which Her Maje&s;ty's Title was Confirm'd
by, during the Life of the Late King. <HI>This
Revolution,</HI> is that upon which the
Liberties and Religion of this Nation,
were Re-built after the Conflagration
that was made of them in the Calamitous
Times of King <HI>Charles</HI> II, and King <HI>James</HI> II.
<PB N="19" REF="20">
and from hence to the Love of Liberty,
which is found almo&s;t to be Naturally
plac'd in the Hearts of true <HI>Britains;</HI> and
upon the View whereof they have acted
all along in the Late War, and in all their
Tran&s;actions at Home has obtained the Ti|tle
of a <HI>REVOLUTION PRINCI|PLE.</HI>
Noting this then, as above, that
Her Maje&s;ty is our Queen by vertue of
the Revolution, and that during Her
Reign, that E&s;tabli&s;hment alone mu&s;t be
the Foundation of all Her Admini&s;trati|on;
this mu&s;t effectually Secure us a|gain&s;t
any Apprehen&s;ion that the Per&s;ons
acting under Her Maje&s;ty, can Act in be|half
of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> during Her Ma|je&s;ty's
Life; for that they mu&s;t immedi|ately
Overthrow the Throne, Turn the
Queen out of it, and Renounce the Re|volution,
upon which Her Maje&s;ty's Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
is E&s;tabli&s;hed: As the Revolution
therefore is the Ba&s;e upon which the Throne
of Her Maje&s;ty's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is E&s;tabli&s;hed;
&s;o her Maje&s;ty, and all that Act under her,
are obliged to Act upon the Foot of the

and Benefactre&s;s, a Subject to the

<P>Sub&s;equent to the Revolution, many
E&s;&s;ential things are form'd by our Parlia|ments
and Government for the publick
Good, on the Foundation of which much
of the pre&s;ent Peace of the Nation is
Founded; and while the &s;aid Revolution
Foundation &s;tands fa&s;t, there is good
Ground to believe tho&s;e E&s;&s;ential Points
&s;hall be pre&s;erved. If then we are &s;atis|fied
that the Revolution Principle &s;hall
&s;ub&s;i&s;t as long as the Queen Lives, then
for &s;o long we may have good Ground
to believe we &s;hall Enjoy all tho&s;e Ad|vantages
and Benefits which we received
from the &s;aid Revolution. But &s;till when
we look back upon tho&s;e dear Privileges,
the obtaining of which has Co&s;t &s;o much
Money, and the Maintaining of which
has Co&s;t &s;o much Blood, we mu&s;t with
a deep Sigh reflect upon the precarious
Circum&s;tances of the Nation, who&s;e be&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="22">
Privileges hang uncertain upon the Nice
and tender Thread of Royal Mortality,
and &s;ay, we are happy while the&s;e la&s;t, and
the&s;e may la&s;t while Her Maje&s;ty &s;hall
Live. <HI>But what if the Queen &s;hould
die?</HI></P>
<P>Let us De&s;cend to &s;ome other Parti|culars
of tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings which we do Enjoy
purely as the Effect of the Revolution,
and Examin in what Po&s;ture we &s;tand,
with re&s;pect to them, and what A&s;&s;urance
we have of their Continuance: And Fir&s;t,
as to <HI>TOLERATION.</HI> This was the
Greate&s;t and fir&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing the Nation felt
after the immediate Settlement of the
Crown, which was E&s;tabli&s;hed by Vertue
of the Revolution Engagement, mentio|ned
in the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Declaration.
The De&s;ign of this Law, as it was to
give Liberty for the Wor&s;hip of God to &s;uch
Di&s;&s;enters as could not Conform to the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> and to give Ea&s;e to
tender Con&s;ciences, &s;o as by the Law it
&s;elf is expre&s;&s;ed; it was to Ea&s;e the Minds
of their Maje&s;ty's Subjects, and to give
general Quiet to the Nation, who&s;e Peace
had been frequently Di&s;turbed by the vio|lence
of Per&s;ecution. We have &s;een fre|quent
A&s;&s;urances given of the Inviolable
Pre&s;ervation of this Toleration by Her
Maje&s;ty from the Throne in Her Speeches
<PB N="22" REF="23">
to the Parliament; and during Her Ma|je&s;ty's
Reign, we have great Rea&s;on to
hope the Quiet of the poor People &s;hall
not be broken by either repealing that Law,
or Invading the Intent and Meaning of
it while it remains in Force; and there is a
great many Rea&s;ons to hope that the pre|&s;ent
Mini&s;try are &s;o far Convinc'd of the
Nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;aid Toleration in order to
pre&s;erve the Peace, and the common
Neighbourhood of People, that they can
have no Thought of Breaking in upon it;
or any way making the People, who En|joy
it, unea&s;ie. Nay, the rather we be|lieve
this, becau&s;e the Ferment &s;uch a

is not the &s;afe&s;t Condition the Govern|ment
can be in upon any Account; And as
the Mini&s;try cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;ire

Death; and when Popi&s;h Pretenders, and
<HI>French</HI> Influencies &s;hall prevail, it may
well be expected then, that not Tolera|tion
of Di&s;&s;enters only, but even of the
whole Prote&s;tant Religion may be in
danger to be Lo&s;t; &s;o that however &s;ecure
we are of the free Enjoyment of Liberty of
Religion during the Queen's Life, we may
be very well allow'd to ask this Que&s;tion
with re&s;pect to not Toleration only, but
the Church of <HI>England</HI> al&s;o, (<HI>viz.</HI>) what
will become of them, <HI>If the Queen &s;hould
die?</HI></P>
<P>From Toleration in <HI>England,</HI> come we
to the Con&s;titution of Religious Affairs in
<HI>Scotland;</HI> and here we have different Views
from what the Ca&s;e in <HI>England</HI> affords us;
the powerful Intere&s;t of Jacobiti&s;m, if it
may be &s;aid to be Formidable any where,
is &s;o there. The Enemies of the Revolu|tion
are all the Implacable Enemies of the
Church E&s;tabli&s;hment there: Nay, many
Thou&s;ands are the declared Enemies of
the Revolution, and of the Queen's being
upon the Throne, from a meer Implaca|ble
Aver&s;ion to the <HI>Presbyterian Kirk,</HI>
which is Erected, and E&s;tabli&s;hed by that
very Revolution which has &s;et the Queen
upon the Throne. The <HI>Union,</HI> which has
yet farther E&s;tabli&s;h'd that <HI>Prebeterian Kirk,</HI>
is for that Rea&s;on the Aver&s;ion of the
<PB N="24" REF="25">
&s;ame People, as it is the Aver&s;ion of the
<HI>Jacobites,</HI> by being a further Confirmati|on
of the <HI>Hannover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, and a fur|ther
Fixing the Queen upon the Throne.
Now as <HI>it is &s;ure,</HI> that <HI>as before,</HI> while the
Queen Lives, and the Revolution Influ|ence
carries its u&s;ual Force in the King|doms
now United, the <HI>Presbyterian Kirk</HI>
mu&s;t and will remain, and all the little En|croachments
which have been made upon
the <HI>Kirk,</HI> as it may be ob&s;erved, tho' they
have created Unea&s;ine&s;s enough, yet they
&s;till &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e that the E&s;tabli&s;hment
it &s;elf cannot be overthrown. The Uni|on
and the Revolution Settlement remain
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and mu&s;t remain, as is &s;aid:
While the Queen Lives we can have no Ap|prehen&s;ions
of them; The Rea&s;ons are
given above; and as we &s;aid before, we are
to take them for granted in this Di&s;cour&s;e,
to avoid other Cavils. While then the
Revolution, and the Union are to be the
Foundation of the Admini&s;tration in <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> E&s;tabli&s;ht Church
Government, there mu&s;t al&s;o remain as
the only Legal <HI>Kirk</HI> Con&s;titution, and &s;o
long we can Entertain no Fears of any
thing on that Account. <HI>But what if the
Queen &s;hould die?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">
From &s;uch Religious Concerns as effect
<HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and other Sectaries, or <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters,</HI>
as we call them; let us take a
look at the remote Danger of the Church
of <HI>England.</HI> We have had a great deal of
Di&s;traction in the time of the late Mini|&s;try,
about the Danger of the Church;
and as it appears by the <HI>Memorial</HI> of the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> publi&s;hed in tho&s;e
times, and Re-printed &s;ince; by the Ser|mons
of Dr. <HI>Sacheverell,</HI> and the eminent
Speeches at his Trial, that Danger was
more e&s;pecially, Sugge&s;ted to come from
the Encrea&s;e of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> here, the Mini|&s;try
of the <HI>Whiggs,</HI> and the E&s;tabli&s;hing
<HI>Presbyteriani&s;m</HI> in the North of <HI>Britain.</HI>
The&s;e things being in a great Mea&s;ure
now overthrown by the late Change of
the Mini&s;try, and the new Methods taken
in the Management of the publick Affairs;
the People who were then &s;uppo&s;ed to
Aim at overthrowing the Mini&s;try of
tho&s;e <HI>Whiggs</HI> are plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ure us of
the Safety and flouri&s;hing Condition of
the Church, now more than ever; while
the other Party, taking up the like Cry
of the Danger of the Church, tell us, that
now a real vi&s;ible appearace of Danger to
the Church is before us; and that not on|ly
to the Church of <HI>England</HI> as &s;uch, but
even to the whole Intere&s;t, and Safety of
<PB N="26" REF="27">
the Prote&s;tant Religion in <HI>Britain;</HI> that this
Danger is imminent, and unavoidable from
the great Growth and Encrea&s;e of <HI>Popery,</HI>
and profe&s;t <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> in the Nation. This
indeed they give but too great Demon|&s;trations
of from the &s;preading of Popi&s;h
Agents among us, who&s;e profe&s;t Employ|ment
it is to Amu&s;e, and Impo&s;e upon the
poor Country People, as well in Matters
of <HI>Jacobiti&s;m,</HI> as of Religion; and the great
Succe&s;s the&s;e Emi&s;&s;aries of Satan have ob|tain'd
in &s;everal Parts of <HI>Britain;</HI> but
e&s;pecially in the North. Now tho' we
cannot but acknowledge, but that much of
this Alarm is ju&s;tly Grounded, and that
the Endeavours of <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Jacobite</HI>
Agents, and Emi&s;&s;aries in diver&s;e Parts
of <HI>Britian,</HI> are too apparently Succe&s;sful;
yet as wi&s;e Men could never &s;ee into the
reality of &s;uch Danger, as was by &s;ome Peo|ple
pretended to be Impending over the
Church in the Time of the late Mini&s;try;
So neither can we allow that Popery is &s;o
Evidently at the Door at this Time, as
that we &s;hould be Apprehen&s;ive of having
the Church of <HI>England</HI> immediately Tran&s;|vers'd,
and the Prote&s;tant Religion in <HI>Bri|tain:</HI>
And one great Rea&s;on for this Opi|nion
is, that Her Maje&s;ty, who is a Zea|lous
Profe&s;&s;or of the Prote&s;tant Religion,
and has been Bred up in the Bo&s;om of the
<PB N="27" REF="28">
Church of <HI>England,</HI> is &s;o Rooted in Prin|ciple,
and had Declared from Her very
Infancy &s;uch Horror and Aver&s;ion to Po|pery,
that it cannot Enter into any true
Prote&s;tant Thoughts to apprehend any
thing of that Kind, while Her Maje&s;ty
lives. <HI>BUT</HI> Lord have Mercy upon
us! <HI>What if the Queen &s;hould die?</HI></P>
<P>From Religious Matters, come we next
to con&s;ider Civil Intere&s;t, Liberties, Privi|leges,
Properties; the Great Article that
in the late Revolution, went always
Coupled in the Nation's Negative, with
that of Religion, as if they were woven
together; and was always Cry'd upon by
the Mob in one Breath, (<HI>viz.</HI>) No <HI>Popery,</HI>
no <HI>Slavery.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e concerns
our Civil Intere&s;t; &s;uch as the Publick
Credit, by the Occa&s;ions of a long and
Expen&s;ive War, and to prevent Levying
&s;evere Taxes for the Carrying on the War,
&s;uch as would be Grievous to Trade, Op|pre&s;&s;ive
to the Poor, and Difficult to be
Paid. The Parliament for the Ea&s;e of the
Subjects, thought fit, rather to lay Funds
of Intere&s;t to rai&s;e Money upon, by way
of Loan; E&s;tabli&s;hing tho&s;e Intere&s;ts, pay|able
as Annuities, and Annual Payments
for the Benefit of tho&s;e who Advanc'd their
Money for the publick Service. And to
<PB N="28" REF="29">
make the&s;e things Current, that the pub|lick
Credit might be Sacred, and the
People be made free to Advance their
Money; all po&s;&s;ible A&s;&s;urances of Parlia|ment
have been given, that the Payments
of Intere&s;ts, and Annuities &s;hall be kept
punctually, and Exactly according to the
Acts of Parliament, that no Mi&s;-applica|ons
of the Money &s;hall be made, or Con|verting
the Money received upon one,
to make good the Deficiency of the other;
and hitherto the Injunctions of that Kind
have been exactly ob&s;erv'd, and the Pay|ments
punctually made, which we call
the Credit of the Nation. At the fir&s;t of
the late Change, when the New Mini|&s;try
began to Act, the Fright the People
were put in upon the Sugge&s;tion of &s;ome,
that all the Parliamentary Funds &s;hould be
wiped off with a Spunge, was very Con&s;ide|rable;
and the Credit of tho&s;e Funds &s;unk
Exceedingly, with but the bare Appre|hen&s;ion
of &s;uch a Blow; the Sums being
Infinitely great, and the Number of Indi|gent
Families being Incredibly many
who&s;e whole Sub&s;tance lay in tho&s;e Secu|rities,
and who&s;e Bread depended upon
tho&s;e Intere&s;ts being punctually Paid:
But wi&s;er Men &s;aw quickly there was
no Ground for tho&s;e Fears; that the New
Mini&s;try &s;tood upon a Foot that could no
<PB N="29" REF="30">
more be Supported without the publick
Credit, than tho&s;e that went before them;
that E&s;pecially while they were under a
Nece&s;&s;ity of Borrowing further Sums, they
behoved to Secure the punctual Paying of
the Old; and by making the People en|tirely
Ea&s;ie, not only take from them the
Apprehen&s;ions they were under of Lo&s;ing
what they Lent already; but make them
forward, and willing to Advance more to
this Purpo&s;e. They not only Endeavoured
to give the People all po&s;&s;ible Satisfacti|on
that their Money was Safe, and that
the Funds laid by the Parliament in
the former Mini&s;try, &s;hould be kept Sa|cred,
and the Payments punctually made;
but took care to obtain Parliamentary Se|curities,
by real Funds to be Settled for
the Payment of tho&s;e Debts contracted by
the former Mini&s;try; and for which no
Provi&s;ion was made before. This was the
E&s;tabli&s;hment of a Fund for Payment of
the Intere&s;ts of the <HI>Navy</HI> Debt, Ordnance,
Victualling, Tran&s;port, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the Val|lue
of Seven or Eight Millions; which is
the Sub&s;tance of what we now call the
South-Sea Stock. By this means the pub|lick
Credit, which, it was Sugge&s;ted, would
receive &s;uch a Blow at the Change, as that
it &s;hould never recover again; and that it
would be Impo&s;&s;ible for the New Mini|&s;try
<PB N="30" REF="31">
to Rai&s;e any needful Sums of Money
for the Carrying on the War, or for the
publick Occa&s;ions, recovered it &s;elf &s;o as
that the Government hath ever &s;ince found
it Ea&s;ie to Borrow what ever Sums they
thought fit to Demand in the &s;ame man|ner
as before. Now that the&s;e Loans are
Safe, no Man that weighs the Circum|&s;tances
of the Mini&s;try and Government,
and the Circum&s;tances of the People,
can Doubt; the fir&s;t being in a con&s;tant
Nece&s;&s;ity of Supporting the publick Cre|dit
for the Carrying on publick Affairs,
on any &s;uddain Emergency that may hap|pen;
and being liable to the Re&s;entment
of Parliament, if any open Infraction
&s;hould be made upon the Funds, which
touches &s;o nearly the Honour of the Par|liaments,
and the Intere&s;t of mo&s;t of the
be&s;t Families in the Nation. While this
is the Ca&s;e, we think it is not Rational to
believe that any Mini&s;try will venture to
attack Parliamentary Credit, in &s;uch a
manner; and this will Eminently be the
Ca&s;e as long as Her Maje&s;ty &s;its on the
Throne. Nor can a thing &s;o bare-fac'dly
Tyrannical and Arbitrary, and above all
Di&s;honourble and Unju&s;t, be Sugge&s;ted, as
po&s;&s;ible to be Attempted in the Reign of
&s;o Ju&s;t and Con&s;ciencious a Prince; So
that we may be very willing to allow that
<PB N="31" REF="32">
there is not the lea&s;t Danger of the publick
Faith being Broken, the publick Credit
lo&s;t, the publick Funds &s;topt, or the Money
being Mi&s;-apply'd. No Cheat, no Spunge
while Her Maje&s;ty. <HI>BUT</HI> Alas for us!
<HI>What if the Queen &s;hould die?</HI></P>
<P>From this piece of Civil Right, come
we to tho&s;e Things we call Liberties, and
Privileges. The&s;e may indeed be joyned
in &s;ome Re&s;pects; but as we are Engag'd
in &s;peaking particularly to &s;uch Points,
wherein our pre&s;ent Dangers do, or do
not appear; It is proper to mention them
apart. <HI>Privileges</HI> may be di&s;tingui&s;hed
here from Liberties, as they re&s;pect Af|fairs
of Trade, Corporations, Parliaments,
and Legi&s;lature, <HI>&amp;c. Liberty,</HI> as they re|&s;pect
Laws, E&s;tabli&s;hments, declared Right,
and &s;uch like. As to the fir&s;t, from the Re|volution
to this Time they have not
only been Confirm'd, which we had before;
but many Privileges added to the People;
Some of which are E&s;&s;ential to the well-being
of the Kingdom. All the <HI>Quo
Warranto's</HI> again&s;t Corporation Privileges,
the High-Commi&s;&s;ion Court again&s;t the
Church's Privileges extending Preroga|tive
in Detriment of the Subjects natu|ral
Right; and many &s;uch things, which
were Fatal to the Privileges of this Pro|te&s;tant
<PB N="32" REF="33">
Nation, were laid a&s;ide, and recei|ved
their ju&s;t Condemnation in the Re|volution;
and not &s;o only, but the Privi|leges
obtain'd &s;ince the Revolation by
Con&s;ent of Parliament, are very con&s;ide|rable;
&s;uch as the Toleration to this part
of <HI>Britain,</HI> and the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the
Church of <HI>Scotland:</HI> For the North part,
in matters of Religion; &s;uch as the Tri|ennial
Election of Parliaments; In Civil
Affairs, &s;uch as the &s;everal Corporations
Granted upon really u&s;eful Foundations
in Trade; as the <HI>Bank Company,</HI> &amp;c and
&s;uch like. The&s;e and many more, which
may be Named; and which the&s;e are
Named only as Heads of, are Secured to
us by Law; and tho&s;e Laws yet again
made &s;ure to us by the Honour and Ve|racity
of Her Maje&s;ty, and as long as Her
Maje&s;ty's Life is &s;pared to the&s;e Nations,
we have great Rea&s;on to believe we &s;hall
rather Encrea&s;e than Lo&s;e our Privileges.
<HI>BUT what if the Queen &s;hould die?</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>LIBERTIES,</HI> which come
next in Order may be Summ'd up in what
we call <HI>Legal,</HI> and <HI>Native</HI> Right; or
&s;uch as by the natural Con&s;equence of
a Free Nation, and a ju&s;t Government;
or &s;uch as by mutual A&s;&s;ent and Con&s;ent
of Soveraign and Subject, are become the
<PB N="33" REF="34">
Legal Right of the latter. The&s;e, need|le&s;s
to be Enumerated here, are Summ'd
up into One; or are expre&s;ly Enacted by
Statute Law, and thereby become Funda|mental
to the Con&s;titution. The&s;e receive
no Wound, but one of the&s;e two ways, ei|ther
by open Infraction, and Contempt of
Right, or by Di&s;pen&s;ing Arbitrary Power;
both of which by the many A&s;&s;urances
from the Throne, by the con&s;tant Jealou|&s;ies
of Parliaments, and the full Liberty
they have more of late, than ever, taken to
Examin into, and Cen&s;ure Breaches of the
Laws: We are very well a&s;&s;ured &s;hall not
be Attempted in Her Maje&s;ty's time: Nay,
on the contrary, the Superiority, and In|fluence
of Parliaments over and upon the
Management of publick Matters. Nay,
even their Influences upon the Royal Ma|je&s;ty
of the Soveraign, has been &s;uch, and
has in &s;uch a manner In&s;en&s;ibly Increa&s;ed
of Late, that the like has never been
known, or Practi&s;ed in this Nation for
&s;ome Ages before. We &s;ee Her Maje&s;ty
declines Extending Her Perogative, either
to the Detriment of Her Subjects, in Ca&s;es
Civil, or Religious; and wherein it might
be &s;o Extended; nay, when even the
Parliament have de&s;ir'd Her to Extend it:
So that we have a great Satisfaction in the
Safety of our E&s;tabli&s;hed Liberties, and
<PB N="34" REF="35">
that no Tyrannical Arbitrary Inva&s;ions of

<P>In like manner for our Properties, our

they become Tyrants and Arbitrary, De|&s;potick
Invaders of Right. This is De|clared
by the Revolution, wherein the
Right of the Subject are openly, not &s;et
down only, but Claim'd, Demanded at
what Ju&s;tice required &s;hould be Granted
to them, and as what the Soveraign as
afore&s;aid has no Right, no Pretence, no
ju&s;t Authority to take, or detain from
him. This is the Great Capital and
Fundamental Article of <HI>Magna-Charta,</HI> and
the Foundation upon which all the Laws
Sub&s;equent, and Con&s;equential to <HI>Magna-Charta</HI>
have been made [<HI>No freeman &s;hall
be Taken or Impri&s;oned, or be Di&s;&s;eized of
<PB N="35" REF="36">
his Freehold, or Liberties, or Free Cu&s;toms,
or be Out-lawed, or Exiled, or otherwi&s;e De|&s;troyed;
nor we will not pa&s;s upon him, nor
Condemn him, but by Lawful Iudgement of
his Peers, or by the Law of the Land. <HI>Magna-Charta,</HI></HI>
Cap. xxix.] The Words are
Plain and Direct; and as to the Subject, we
are now upon, they require no Comment,
no Explication. Whatever they do, as to
Pleading in Law; the Proof of the Sub|ject's
Right to the free Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
own Property, is al&s;o the le&s;s needful to
Enlarge upon here, becau&s;e it is acknow|ledged
in full, and expre&s;s Terms by the
Soveraign, as well in Practi&s;e, as in Ex|pre&s;&s;ion.
Her Maje&s;ty adhering &s;trictly
to this, as a Rule, has from the beginning
of Her Reign, made it Her <HI>Golden Rule,</HI>
to Govern according to Law. Nor while
the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Crown it &s;elf is
Built upon the Legal Con&s;titution of this
Nation, can it be otherwi&s;e here: That
Prince that Governs here and not by Law,
may be &s;aid, rather to Oppre&s;s, than to
Govern, rather to Over-rule, than to Rule
over his People. <HI>NOW</HI> it cannot with|out
great and unju&s;tifyable Violence to
Her Maje&s;ty's ju&s;t Government, be Sug|ge&s;ted,
that we are in any Danger of Op|pre&s;&s;ion
during the Righteous Admini&s;tra|tion
of Her Maje&s;ty's Reign. The Queen
<PB N="36" REF="37">
Rai&s;es no Money without Act of Parlia|ment,
keeps up no Standing Army in time
of <HI>Peace,</HI> Di&s;-&s;eizes no Man of his Property,
or E&s;tate; but every Man Sits in Safety
under his own Vine, and his Fig-tree;
and we doubt not but we &s;hall do as long
as Her Maje&s;ty Lives. <HI>BUT what if the
Queen &s;hould die?</HI></P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly Cavils may Ri&s;e in the Mouths
of tho&s;e who&s;e Conduct this Nice Que&s;ti|on
may &s;eem to Affect, that this is a Que|&s;tion
unfit to be asked, and Que&s;tionle&s;s
&s;uch People will have much to &s;ay upon
that Subject; as that it is a Factious Que|&s;tion,
a Que&s;tion Needle&s;s to be An&s;wered,
and Impertinent therefore to be askt; that
it is a Que&s;tion which re&s;pects things re|mote,
and &s;erves only to fill the Heads
of the People with Fears and Jealou&s;ies;
that it is a Que&s;tion, to which no direct
An&s;wer can be given, and which Sugge&s;ts
&s;trange Surmi&s;es, and amu&s;es People a|bout
they know not what, and is of no
u&s;e, but to make People unea&s;ie without
Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>As there is no Objection, which is Ma|terial
enough to make, but is Material
enough to An&s;wer; &s;o this, altho' there
is nothing of Sub&s;tance in it, may
<PB N="37" REF="38">
Introduce &s;omething in its An&s;wer of Sub|&s;tance
enough to con&s;ider: It is therefore
mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to Convince the con&s;ider|ing
Reader of the U&s;efulne&s;s and Nece&s;&s;ity
of putting this Que&s;tion; and then like|wi&s;e
the U&s;efulne&s;s, and Nece&s;&s;ity of
putting this Que&s;tion <HI>NOW</HI> at this time;
and if it appear to be both a needful Que|&s;tion
it &s;elf, and a &s;ea&s;onable Que&s;tion,
as to time the re&s;t of the Cavils again&s;t, it
will de&s;erve the le&s;s regard. That it is a need|ful
Que&s;tion, &s;eems ju&s;tified more abun|dantly
from a very great Example, to wit,
the Practi&s;e of the whole Nation, in Set|tling
the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown. This
I take to be nothing el&s;e, but this: The
Queen having no I&s;&s;ue of Her Body, and
the Pretender to the Crown being Ex|pelled
by Law, Included in his Father's
Di&s;a&s;trous Flight, and Abdication; when
the Parliament came to Con&s;ider of the
State of the Nation, as to Government
as it now &s;tands; that King <HI>William</HI> be|ing
lately Dead, and Her Maje&s;ty with
univer&s;al Joy of Her People, being reciev'd
as Queen, the Safety, and the la&s;ting
Happine&s;s of the Nation is &s;o far Secur'd
<HI>BUT what if the Queen &s;hould die?</HI></P>
<P>The Introduction to all the Acts of Par|liaments
for Settling the Crown, Implies
<PB N="38" REF="39">
thus much, and &s;peaks directly this Lan|guage
(<HI>viz.</HI>) to make the Nation Safe and
Ea&s;ie, in Ca&s;e the Queen &s;hould die: Nor are
any of tho&s;e Acts of Parliament Impeach'd
of Faction, or Impertinencies; much le&s;s
of Needle&s;s blaming the People, and fil|ling
their Heads with Fears and Jealou|&s;ies.
If this Example of the Parliament
is not enough, Ju&s;tifying to this Enquiry
the well known Truth, upon which that
Example of Parliament is Grounded, is
&s;ufficient to ju&s;tifie it, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That we all
known the Queen <HI>MUST die.</HI> None
&s;ay, this with more Concern and Regret,
than tho&s;e who are forwarde&s;t to put this
Que&s;tion, as being of the Opinion above|&s;aid,
that we are effectually Secured a|gain&s;t
the Pretender, and again&s;t all the
terrifying Con&s;equences of the <HI>Frenchi|fy'd</HI>
Govournours during Her Maje&s;ty's
Life. But this is Evident, <HI>the Queen is
Mortal,</HI> tho' crown'd with all that Flattering
Courtiers can bring together, to make
Her appear Great, Glorious, Famous, or
what you plea&s;e; yet the Queen, yea, the
Queen Her &s;elf is. <HI>Mortal,</HI> and <HI>MUST
die.</HI> It is true, Kings and Queens are
called Gods; but this re&s;pects their Sacred
Power: nothing &s;uppo&s;ing and Immortal|lity
attending their Per&s;ons, for they all
<HI>Die</HI> like other Men, and their Du&s;t knows
<PB N="39" REF="40">
no Di&s;tinction in the Grave. Since then it
is mo&s;t certain that the Queen <HI>MUST
die,</HI> and our Safety, and Happine&s;s in this
Nation depends &s;o much upon the Stabi|lity
of our Liberties, Religion, and afore|&s;aid
Dependencies after Her Maje&s;ty's
Life &s;hall End, it cannot be a Que&s;tion
Offen&s;ive to any who has any Concern
in the Publick good, to enquire into what
&s;hall be the State of our Condition,
or the Po&s;ture of our Affairs, when the
Queen &s;hall die; <HI>but this is not all neither.</HI>
As the Queen is Mortal, and we are
a&s;&s;ured &s;he mu&s;t die; &s;o we are none of
us certain, as to be able to know when,
or how &s;oon that Di&s;a&s;ter may happen,
at what time, or in what manner. This
then, as it may be remote, and not a long
time; <HI>God of his Infinite Mercy grant it
may be long fir&s;t, and not before this dif|ficult
Que&s;tion we are upon, be Effectually and
Satisfactorily An&s;wered to the Nation:</HI> So
on the other &s;ide, it may be <HI>near;</HI> None
of us know how <HI>near</HI> the fatal Blow may
befal us &s;oon, and &s;ooner far than we may
be ready; for to day it may come, while
the cavilling Reader is objecting again&s;t
our putting this Que&s;tion, and calling it
Unrea&s;onable and Needle&s;s; while the Word
is in thy very Mouth, maye&s;t thou hear
the fatal Melancholly News, <HI>the Queen's
<PB N="40" REF="41">
Dead.</HI> News that mu&s;t one time, or
other be heard; the Word will certainly
come &s;ome time, or other, to be &s;poken in
the pre&s;ent Sen&s;e, and to be &s;ure in the
time they are &s;poken in. How can any
one then &s;ay, that it is improper to
ask what &s;hall be our Ca&s;e, what &s;hall we
do, or what &s;hall be done with us <HI>if the
Queen &s;hould die?</HI></P>
<P>But we have an other Melancholy
Incident, which attends the Queen's Mor|tality,
and which makes this Que&s;tion
more than ordinarily &s;ea&s;onable to be
ask'd at this time; and that is, that not only
the Queen is Mortal, and &s;he <HI>MUST
die,</HI> and the time uncertain; &s;o that &s;he
<HI>may die,</HI> even to Day before to Morrow,
or in a very little &s;pace of time: But Her
Life is under God's Providence, at the
Mercy of <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Jacobites</HI> People;
who the one by their Principles, and the
other by the Circum&s;tances of their Party
are more than ordinarily to be Apprehend|ed
for their bloody De&s;igns again&s;t Her
Maje&s;ty, and again&s;t the whole Nation.
Nay, there &s;eems more Rea&s;on to be Ap|prehen&s;ive
of the dangerous Attempts of
the&s;e de&s;perate People, at this time, than
ever, even from the very Rea&s;ons which
are given all along in this Work, for our
<PB N="41" REF="42">
being Safe in our Privileges, our Religi|ous
and Civil Rights during Her Maje&s;ty's
Life; it would be mi&s;pending your time
prove to that the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Jacobite</HI> Parties
in this Nation, however they may, as we
have &s;aid, be under Tyes and Obliga|tions
of Honour, Intere&s;t, and Gratitude,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Not to make attempt upon us during
the Queen's Life; yet that they are more
Encouraged at this time than ever they
were to hope and believe, that when the
Queen &s;hall die, their Turn &s;tands next.
This we &s;ay, we believe is lo&s;t Labour to
&s;peak of: The &s;aid People, the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> and
<HI>Tory</HI> Party will freely own and oppo&s;e it.
They all take their Obligations to the
Queen, to End with Her Maje&s;ty's Life.
The <HI>French King,</HI> however in Honour, and
Gratitude he may think him&s;elf bound to
Encourage the <HI>Pretender</HI> to in&s;ult Her
Maje&s;ty's Dominions, while the Queen
with whom he Per&s;onally is Engaged by
Treaty, &s;hall remain alive, will think him|&s;elf
fully at Liberty from tho&s;e Obligations
when the Queen &s;hall die. If we are mi&s;|inform'd
of the <HI>French</HI> Affairs, and of the
Notions, they have in <HI>France</HI> of the&s;e things,
they are generally no otherwi&s;e under&s;tood
then that the King of <HI>France</HI> is Engag'd by
the Peace now in View, not to di&s;turb Her
Maje&s;ty's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion during Her Reign,
<PB N="42" REF="43">
and Life; but that then the <HI>Pretender's</HI>
Right is to be receiv'd every where. The
<HI>Pretender</HI> him&s;elf, how&s;oever, as above&s;aid,
he may de&s;pair of his Succe&s;s in Attempting
to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion during the Queen's Life,
will not fail to a&s;&s;ume new Hopes at Her
Maje&s;ty's Death: So much then of the
hopes of <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Power; &s;o
much of the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender</HI> de|pending
upon the &s;ingle Thread of Life
of a Mortal Per&s;on; and we being well
a&s;&s;ur'd that they look upon Her Maje&s;ty,
only as the Incumbent in a Living, or
Tenant for Life in an E&s;tate, what is more
Natural, than in this Ca&s;e for us to appre|hend
Danger to the Life of the Queen;
E&s;pecially to &s;uch People, who are known
not to make much Con&s;ciencies of Murther|ing
Princes, with whom the King killing
Doctrine is &s;o Univer&s;ally receiv'd, and
who were &s;o often Detected of villanious
Practices, and Plots again&s;t the Life of
Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Her Maje&s;ty's fa|mous
Predece&s;&s;or, and that upon the &s;ame
Foundation, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The Queen of <HI>Scots</HI>
being the <HI>Popi&s;h Pretender</HI> to the Crown;
what can we expect from the &s;ame Party,
and Men acting from the &s;ame Principles;
but the &s;ame Practices. It is known that
the Queen by Cour&s;e of Nature may Live
many Years, and the&s;e People have many
<PB N="43" REF="44">
Rea&s;ons to be Impatient of &s;o much Delay.
They know that many Accidents may
Intervene to make the Circum&s;tances of
the Nation at the Time of the Queen's
Death, le&s;s favourable to their Intere&s;ts
than they are now; they may have fewer
Friends, as well in Power, as out of Power
by length of time, and the like: The&s;e,
and &s;uch as the&s;e Con&s;iderations may ex|cite
Vilanious and Murtherous Practices
again&s;t the precious Life of our Soveraign
(God protect Her Maje&s;ty from them)
but while all the&s;e Con&s;iderations &s;o Na|turally
offer them&s;elves to us, it &s;eems mo&s;t
Rational needful, &s;ea&s;onable and ju&s;t, that
we &s;hould be Asking and An&s;wering this
great Que&s;tion, <HI>What if the Queen &s;hould
die?</HI></P>
<P>Thus far we have only asked the Que|&s;tion
it &s;elf, and &s;hewed our Rea&s;ons, or
Endeavoured to Ju&s;tifie the Rea&s;onablne&s;s
of the Enquiry. It follows that we make
&s;ome brief E&s;&s;ay as an An&s;wer to the Que|&s;tion.
This may be done many ways; but
the De&s;ign of this Tract is rather to put
the Que&s;tion into your Thought, than to
put an An&s;wer into your Mouths. The
&s;everal An&s;wers which may be given to
this Important Que&s;tion may not be pro|per
for a publick Print; and &s;ome may
<PB N="44" REF="45">
not be fit &s;o much as to be &s;poken. The
Que&s;tion is not without its U&s;es, whether
it be An&s;wered or no, if the Nation be
&s;ufficiently Awaken'd; but to ask the
Que&s;tion among them&s;elves, they will be
brought by thinking of the thing to An|&s;wer
it one to another in a &s;hort Space
The People of <HI>Britain,</HI> want only to be
&s;hewed what imminent Danger they are
in, in Ca&s;e of the Queen's Decea&s;e: How
much their Safety and Felicity depends
upon the Life of Her Maje&s;ty, and what
a State of Confu&s;ion, Di&s;tre&s;&s;, and all
Sorts of dreadful Calamities they will fall
into at Her Maje&s;ty's Death, if &s;omething
be not done to Settle them before Her
Death; and if they are not during Her
Maje&s;ty's Life &s;ecured from the Power of
<HI>France,</HI> and the Danger of the <HI>Pretender&punc;</HI></P>
