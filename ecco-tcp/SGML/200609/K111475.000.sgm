<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING promis'd a Second Vo|lume
of this Hi&s;tory when I
publi&s;h'd the Fir&s;t, it is now
become a Debt of &s;o many Years
&s;tanding, that I don't know whether the
bare di&s;charging it will be thought &s;uf|ficient,
without &s;aying &s;omething in Ex|cu&s;e
for my having deferr'd it &s;o long.
And yet upon &s;econd Thoughts, I believe
I might ea&s;ily have been forgiven, if I had
never di&s;charg'd it: For the World is not
&s;o rigid in demanding Debts of this kind,
as we Authors imagine. But to deal plainly,
I have been many Years employ'd in Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
of another kind; tho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s
it has been with very little Advantage to
the Publick, or My&s;elf; and much le&s;s do
<PB REF="4">
I propo&s;e any great Benefit to ari&s;e to ei|ther
from this Undertaking. However it
has &s;erv'd to &s;hift the Scene a little, and to
gratify my own Inclinations, in renewing
my Acquaintance with tho&s;e Studies which
I have formerly pur&s;u'd.</P>
<P>I have pleas'd my&s;elf with the Thoughts
of doing &s;ome &s;ort of Ju&s;tice to the Me|mory
of a Race of Worthies, who may
be call'd the fir&s;t A&s;&s;ertors of publick Li|berty:
And if I have not &s;ucceeded &s;o
well in it as I could wi&s;h, I hope it will
be imputed rather to the Nature of the
Subject, than to any want of my Endea|vours.
In the former Part of this Hi&s;tory,
I did not find it an ea&s;y Task to take off
that Veil of <HI>Fable</HI> and <HI>Fiction,</HI> which has
been thrown over the fir&s;t Ages of <HI>Greece,</HI>
and to introduce, in the room of it, &s;ome|thing
like the <HI>Colouring</HI> of Hi&s;tory. And
even in the later Times, which are call'd
<HI>Hi&s;torical,</HI> I have met with too much In|tricacy
and Confu&s;ion, in the treating of
&s;o many &s;eparate States, in unravelling
their different Intere&s;ts, in de&s;cribing their
different Manners and Cu&s;toms, and Forms
<PB REF="5">
of Government, and in connecting the
Whole with the Body of the Story.</P>
<P>In the Progre&s;s of this Work, I have
found more Difficulties of this kind, than
I apprehended at my fir&s;t Entrance upon
it; and it is that which, I believe, has
chiefly di&s;courag'd others from undertaking
it. For I cannot otherwi&s;e conceive how
it &s;hould happen, that the Hi&s;tory of a
Country, which has been the Scene of &s;o
much Action within it&s;elf, and which has
given Birth to &s;o many great Events in o|ther
Parts of the World, &s;hould be &s;o
much neglected. I do not mean, that it
has been wholly buried in the Ru&s;t and
Ruins of Antiquity; but it certainly has
not receiv'd a due Proportion of tho&s;e Im|provements,
which have been made of late
Years both in Ancient and Modern Hi&s;to|ry,
as well as in other Arts and Sciences.
For tho' there have been many Parts of
the Affairs of the <HI>Grecians</HI> extracted from
their Hi&s;torians, and Biographers, Poets,
Orators and Philo&s;ophers, with great Va|riety
of Glo&s;&s;es and Comments upon 'em;
yet they are in &s;uch detach'd Pieces, and
<PB REF="6">
&s;o unmethodiz'd, that they can only &s;erve
as the Ground-work for a more regular
Compo&s;ition; and as &s;uch I have made
u&s;e of them. There are &s;ome Collections
of this kind, which are more in the Form
of Hi&s;tory: But the Facts contain'd in
them are related in &s;o dry and lifele&s;s a
manner, that there is nothing of the true
Spirit of <HI>Greece</HI> in them. And a further
Objection to them is, that they are inter|mix'd
with the Affairs of other Nations,
which have no relation to them. This is
the Method ob&s;erv'd by the Writers of
<HI>Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory,</HI> who&s;e chief Merit is
the pre&s;erving the Order of Time; but for
the &s;ake of that, they invert the Order of
Place, and hurry you on from one Coun|try
to another, without any natural Agree|ment
or Connection. Such a confu&s;ed Va|riety
of Matter may do well enough, when
it is compri&s;ed in tho&s;e &s;hort <HI>Compendiums</HI>
of <HI>Chronology,</HI> which are de&s;ign'd to im|print
on the Memory the Dates of the
mo&s;t remarkable Events, as they have hap|pen'd
in the World. But the relating
things at length in an Hi&s;torical Way, and
<PB REF="7">
blending together Sacred Story and Pro|fane,
Ancient and Modern, Foreign and
Dome&s;tick, as it di&s;tracts the Mind of the
Reader too much, &s;o it is a Work of too
great Labour and Extent for the Writer,
to be throughly executed.</P>
<P>He who has &s;ucceeded be&s;t in this way,
is <HI>Mon&s;ieur Rollin,</HI> who has cull'd out the
Flowers of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Story, and inter|&s;pers'd
them in the Accounts, which he
has given of the other ancient Kingdoms
and Common-wealths. But be&s;ides the
relating things by Piece-meal in the con|fus'd
manner before-mention'd, he has o|mitted
&s;everal Particulars which are mate|rial,
and in others which are not &s;o, he is
too circum&s;tantial. And his Reflections,
tho' they are generally ju&s;t, are too fre|quent
and too tedious, too trite and ob|vious,
and too juvenile. However they
may be &s;uited to the De&s;ign of his Pro|vince
in the In&s;titution of Youth, and may
&s;erve as Lectures to in&s;til into their Minds
Principles of Virtue and Morality, they
are not &s;o agreeable as they &s;hould be to
the Laws of Hi&s;tory, which will allow of
<PB REF="8">
very few Reflections, but &s;uch as naturally
ari&s;e to the Reader from a &s;imple Relation
of Facts, or &s;uch at lea&s;t, as are inter|woven
in the Body of the Story, &s;o as not
to break the Thread of it. I would not
be thought to detract from the Merit of a
Work, which has met with a pretty gene|ral
Approbation, and is now in every Body's
Hands. The Author has certainly taken
great Care and Pains in it: He is copious
in his Matter, faithful in his Authorities,
and clear and ea&s;y in his Narration; and
there is a Spirit of Liberty throughout the
Whole, which is well &s;uited to the Sub|ject,
and which few of his Countrymen,
except <HI>Mon&s;ieur Tourreil,</HI> have attain'd to.
Wherefore, tho' I had compos'd the fol|lowing
Sheets before his Hi&s;tory appear'd
in the World, I will freely own, that it
has been of Service to me in the Revi&s;al of
them.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t likewi&s;e acknowledge the Lights
I have receiv'd in &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of this
Hi&s;tory, from the <HI>Grecian Antiquities</HI> of
<HI>The mo&s;t Reverend the Lord Archbi&s;hop of
Canterbury,</HI> who is no le&s;s eminent for his
<PB REF="9">
exten&s;ive Knowledge in all Parts of Learn|ing,
than for his other great Qualities.
And however this Work may have &s;erv'd
as an Amu&s;ement to <HI>His Grace</HI> in the early
Cour&s;e of his Studies, it cannot now be
thought unworthy of his more advanc'd
Age, nor unbecoming either his holy Pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
or his high Station.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before I &s;ent the&s;e Sheets to the
Pre&s;s, I met with <HI>The Hi&s;tory of</HI> Epami|nondas,
lately publi&s;h'd at <HI>Paris</HI> by the
<HI>Abb&eacute; de la Tour,</HI> being intended to &s;upply
the Lo&s;s of that Life of him, which was
wrote by <HI>Plutarch.</HI> I likewi&s;e receiv'd <HI>A
Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> in Manu&s;cript upon the &s;ame
Subject, which had been pronounc'd in the
<HI>Academy of the Belles Lettres and In&s;crip|tions,</HI>
by the <HI>Abb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eA Gedoyn,</HI> and which was
communicated to me in a very obliging
manner from <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Fontenelle.</HI> I was
de&s;irous to &s;ee if any thing material had
e&s;cap'd me in my Account of the greate&s;t
Man of <HI>Greece:</HI> And the Peru&s;al of the&s;e
two Pieces has &s;erv'd to clear up to me
&s;ome doubtful Pa&s;&s;ages concerning him,
and to confirm me in others.</P>
<P><PB REF="10">
As to this &s;econd Part of the <HI>Grecian</HI>
Story, it contains the Tran&s;actions of &s;ixty
eight Years, which is not a twentieth Part
of the Time compris'd in the fir&s;t Volume:
But what it wants in the Number of Years,
is made up in the Variety of Events, and
the Fullne&s;s of the Materials. This Compa&s;s
of Time, together with the twenty-&s;even
preceding Years of the <HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI> War, was
the mo&s;t active and bu&s;tling Age of the
<HI>Grecians,</HI> who, when they were freed from
the Danger of a Foreign Enemy, fell into
&s;uch Di&s;&s;en&s;ions, as turn'd the Edge of the
Sword again&s;t them&s;elves, and ended in
the De&s;truction of that Liberty, which
they had &s;o gloriou&s;ly defended. There
were &s;till among them &s;ome true Patriots,
who aim'd at nothing further than the ge|neral
Safety of <HI>Greece,</HI> and an equal Ba|lance
among the &s;everal Common-wealths:
But it was the fixing and pre&s;erving this
Balance, which created &s;o much Difficulty
and Di&s;turbance. Among &s;o many diffe|rent
Governments and popular A&s;&s;emblies,
it was hardly po&s;&s;ible to avoid Confu&s;ion
and Di&s;cord: And the <HI>Demagogues,</HI> and
<PB REF="11">
other artful and de&s;igning Men, from
hence took occa&s;ion to perplex and inflame
Matters &s;till more, in order to carry on
their own &s;elfi&s;h Views at the Expence of
the Publick. There was one Part of the
Con&s;titution of <HI>Greece</HI> well de&s;ign'd to re|medy
the&s;e Inconveniences, and that was
the <HI>Council of the Amphictyons,</HI> who were
in the nature of <HI>States General,</HI> and were
intended not only to provide for the com|mon
Good and Safety of the Whole, but
to decide the Differences, and adju&s;t the
Preten&s;ions of each particular State; and
great Regard was paid to their Determina|tions.
But tho' they were conven'd twice
a Year, it was mo&s;tly for form-&s;ake; &s;o
that, except upon &s;ome very extraordinary
Occa&s;ions, they &s;eldom did any thing that
an&s;wer'd the End of their In&s;titution.
The <HI>Grecians</HI> had other &s;pecious Shews of
Liberty, and their publick Harangues were
full of it; but it was chiefly in Shew and
in Words, for the Spirit of it was in a
great mea&s;ure lo&s;t. The Band of Amity,
which had united them again&s;t the <HI>Per|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ians,</HI>
was di&s;&s;olv'd. The open, generous
<PB REF="12">
and di&s;intere&s;ted Valour, which they &s;hew'd
upon that Occa&s;ion, began daily to dege|nerate
into Sloth and Luxury, Faction and
Corruption, Fraud and Violence. The
Greater States devour'd the Le&s;&s;er, and
then prey'd upon one another. In &s;hort,
the great Bone of Contention now among
them, was the Sovereignty of <HI>Greece,</HI>
which mo&s;t of them a&s;pir'd to in their
turns; and &s;till, as one Competitor fail'd in
it, there &s;tarted up another. Such was the
convul&s;ive State of <HI>Greece</HI> at the time of
the <HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI> War; and &s;o it continu|ed
as long as it was a Nation. There were
indeed &s;ome quiet Intervals; but they
were &s;hort, and &s;uch as &s;erv'd rather
to recover breath, than to &s;ettle any
cour&s;e of Tranquillity.</P>
<P>In relating the&s;e Wars of the <HI>Grecians</HI> a|mong
them&s;elves, the Reader is not to expect
&s;uch great and &s;urpri&s;ing Incidents, as tho&s;e
which happen'd in their Defence again&s;t
the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> He will not meet with &s;uch
numerous Armies, as tho&s;e which came
with all the Power of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n
Inundation, upon them; nor with &s;uch
<PB REF="13">
&s;ignal Victories, as tho&s;e which have per|petuated
the Names of <HI>Marathon, Sala|mis,
Plataea</HI> and <HI>Mycale.</HI> The Efforts,
which were then made for the Publick
Liberty, had &s;omething more than human
in them, and are not to be accounted for
according to the ordinary cour&s;e of Na|ture.
But however the <HI>Eclat</HI> of the&s;e il|lu&s;trious
Actions may rai&s;e our Attention
and Admiration; yet an Account of the
inte&s;tine Quarrels which &s;ucceeded them,
will furni&s;h us with more of that u&s;eful
Knowledge and In&s;truction, which is to
be drawn from Hi&s;tory. There were few|er
Numbers then brought into the Field,
and le&s;s Blood &s;hed: But the Merit of
the&s;e later Victories con&s;i&s;ted more in the
Skill and Conduct of the Generals, and
the Di&s;cipline of the Troops, than in
the Number of the &s;lain. There were
more Feints and Stratagems, Marches and
Countermarches, Incampments and De|campments,
more &s;urpri&s;ing of Garri&s;ons,
intercepting of Convoys, debauching of
Allies, and cluding of Treaties. In &s;hort,
the <HI>Grecians</HI> were now become much more
<PB REF="14">
expert and refined in the Art of War, and
le&s;s prodigal of their Lives, than when
they had nothing but an hardy de&s;perate
Valour to oppo&s;e to the Multitudes of the
<HI>Barbarians,</HI> and when by that glorious
Stand made at <HI>Thermopylae,</HI> one part of
them devoted them&s;elves to certain death
for the Pre&s;ervation of the re&s;t. Hence it
was, that the&s;e civil Di&s;cords were pro|tracted
to a greater Length, than could
otherwi&s;e have been imagin'd: For con&s;i|dering
the Heat and Rancour, with which
they were carried on, and that the Scene
of Action lay in &s;o narrow a Compa&s;s as
<HI>Greece</HI> &s;trictly &s;o call'd, it might naturally
have been expected, that things would
&s;ooner have been brought to &s;ome general
I&s;&s;ue, and that, by &s;ome deci&s;ive Stroke,
one of the principal Republicks would
have made an intire Conque&s;t of the
Whole. Be&s;ides the Rea&s;ons already given
for the long Continuance, and the fatal
I&s;&s;ue of the&s;e Wars, another material one
may be a&s;&s;ign'd, which is, that the <HI>Gre|cians</HI>
were not content to decide their own
Quarrel, without intere&s;ting Foreign Pow|ers
<PB REF="15">
in it. Mo&s;t of them, to their eternal
Reproach, as they found them&s;elves di|&s;tre&s;s'd,
made mean Applications to their
old Enemies the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who had found
out the Secret of fomenting their Divi|&s;ions,
and &s;upporting one State again&s;t an|other,
in order to weaken the Whole.
<HI>Philip</HI> afterwards improv'd upon the Ex|ample
the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> had &s;et him; and thus
in the end the <HI>Grecian</HI> Liberties were lo&s;t.
The Means by which this Change was
effected, and the Struggles, which were
now and then made by particular Per&s;ons
and States, for recovering the ancient Ho|nour
of <HI>Greece,</HI> is chiefly the Subject of
this Volume.</P>
<P>Here it may not be improper to ob&s;erve,
that notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Commotions,
with which the whole Country was more
or le&s;s agitated, Arts and Sciences re|ceiv'd
daily Improvement, and were car|ried
on to a great degree of Perfection; and
there was more Politene&s;s and Civility,
more Policy and Intrigue, more good
Writing and Speaking, and a greater Va|riety
of Men eminent in all Profe&s;&s;ions,
<PB REF="16">
than in any other Period of time in
<HI>Greece,</HI> or in any other Country in that
Age of the World. And as a thorough
Knowledge of the Lives and Characters of
the&s;e famous Men, does very much conduce to
the Knowledge of the Hi&s;tory of the Times
they liv'd in, I have therefore been the
more exact in de&s;cribing them, &s;o as to
di&s;tingui&s;h their good and bad Qualities,
and to &s;hew in what manner, and in what
degree, they have been beneficial, or hurt|ful
to their Country. In the doing this,
I have found it difficult to reconcile the
different Accounts which have been given
of them by &s;ome of the Hi&s;torians of
tho&s;e Times, who often cla&s;h with one
another, and &s;ometimes even with them|&s;elves.
All that I could do in this ca&s;e,
was to compare them together, to &s;upply
the Defects of one out of another, and
to extract out of the whole tho&s;e Parti|culars,
which appear'd to me the mo&s;t ra|tional
and probable, and mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with
the common known Character of the Per|&s;on
I was de&s;cribing. I have ob&s;erv'd the
&s;ame Method with regard to Facts, as well
<PB REF="17">
as Per&s;ons, throughout the Cour&s;e of this
Hi&s;tory; and where I have met with any
e&s;&s;ential Difference, or manife&s;t Contra|diction,
I have taken notice of it as &s;uch
in the Body of the Story.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider how many Volumes re|lating
to the Affairs of the <HI>Grecians</HI> have
been lo&s;t, we might expect more Confu&s;i|on,
and greater Cha&s;ms in their Story, than
there really are: But it happens very for|tunately,
that &s;ome of their be&s;t Writers,
and of the be&s;t Authority, are &s;till re|maining,
particularly <HI>Thucydides, Xenophon</HI>
and <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> who had a great Share
in the Tran&s;actions they relate, and were
otherwi&s;e mo&s;t remarkable for their Pro|bity
and Veracity. So that the <HI>Groecia
mendax</HI> of <HI>Juvenal</HI> cannot be thought ap|plicable
to the&s;e Writers, or to the Times
in which they flouri&s;h'd, but mu&s;t be un|der&s;tood
only of the <HI>Fabulous Age,</HI> which
undoubtedly is a fitter Subject for the Ex|travagancies
of Poetry, than for the Gra|vity
of an Hi&s;torian. I have accordingly
con&s;ider'd it in that light, and have gone
no further into it than I found nece&s;&s;ary, in
<PB REF="18">
order to make a beginning, and to intro|duce
the more &s;olid and authentick Parts
of the Story. And herein I am &s;ufficiently
warranted by the Example of our own
Hi&s;torians, who have not contented them|&s;elves
with the wild Accounts of the an|cient
<HI>Britons,</HI> but have had recour&s;e to
the <HI>Trojan Brute</HI> as our Founder: And the
<HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Writers begin their Relations from
a Son of <HI>Cecrops</HI> the <HI>Athenian,</HI> or of <HI>Ar|gus,</HI>
who lived an hundred Years before
him. And tho' there is no great Stre&s;s laid
upon the&s;e early Accounts, they are &s;ufficient
to &s;hew, that we have grafted upon the
&s;ame Stock of <HI>Fable</HI> as the <HI>Grecians,</HI> or
rather carried it further, and grafted one
Fable upon another: And the &s;ame Vani|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y
has prevail'd in &s;everal other Parts of
<HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Here I cannot help ob&s;erving, how much
it is to the honour of <HI>Greece,</HI> that &s;o many
Nations have laid claim to her as their
common Mother; and that they have in|vented
&s;o many Fictions and Forgeries to
be con&s;ider'd as <HI>Grecian</HI> Colonies, when
they might more naturally, and with more
<PB REF="19">
Credibility, have drawn their De&s;cent from
&s;ome imaginary Heroes of their own. But
it was the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Fame, and the real
Merit of <HI>Greece,</HI> that made them &s;o fond
of being allied to her: It was the Learn|ing,
Wit and Delicacy of <HI>Athens,</HI> the Laws
and Di&s;cipline of <HI>Sparta,</HI> and the Valour
and Love of Liberty throughout the whole
Country, which put them upon forming
the&s;e Preten&s;ions, in hopes that, by calling
them&s;elves <HI>Grecians,</HI> they &s;hould be thought
to inherit their Virtues, and to act upon
their Principles. And in &s;ome Re&s;pects
they have copied after them, particularly
in their Forms of Government, which
have &s;erv'd as Models to &s;everal con&s;ider|able
States in this Part of the World, but
with &s;uch Variations and Improvements,
as the Wi&s;dom of the later ages has found
nece&s;&s;ary. For tho' the general Plan of
Government in <HI>Greece</HI> was founded upon
Principles of Liberty, there were great Er|rors
and Defects in it, which I have cur|&s;orily
taken notice of, in relating the Tu|mults
and Di&s;orders that have been occa|&s;ion'd
by them. Some of the&s;e Imper|fections
<PB REF="20">
are &s;till retain'd in the Republicks
which are now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in <HI>Europe;</HI>
and others have been added, by refining
too much, and aiming at more Perfection
than that &s;ort of Government is capable of.
I know there have been &s;everal Attempts
to &s;hew, that there may be &s;uch a thing as
a perfect Common-wealth: But how plau|&s;ible
&s;oever the Arguments for it may ap|pear
in Writing, they are not ea&s;ily to be
reduc'd to Practice, &s;o as to prevent the
Tyranny of <HI>The Few</HI> in an <HI>Oligarchy,</HI> or
the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>The Many</HI> in a <HI>De|mocracy.</HI>
This was the Ca&s;e of the two
principal States of <HI>Greece,</HI> upon which mo&s;t
of the others were founded.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sparta</HI> indeed, according to the Set|tlement
of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> there was the Ap|pearance
of a limited Monarchy; but it
was too limited, fir&s;t by the Authority of
the Senate, and afterwards of the <HI>Ephori,</HI>
who, tho' they were originally in&s;tituted
only as a Barrier between the Senate and
the People, &s;oon became the &s;upreme Ma|gi&s;trates,
and were &s;uperior to the Kings
in every thing but the Name. However
<PB REF="21">
the Government &s;ub&s;i&s;ted long under this
Form; and the <HI>Roman</HI> Common-wealth
was founded upon it, the <HI>Con&s;uls</HI> An&s;wer|ing
to the two <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings, and the
<HI>Tribunes of the People</HI> to the <HI>Ephori.</HI> But
the&s;e <HI>Roman</HI> Magi&s;trates had greater Power,
and made a wor&s;e u&s;e of it, e&s;pecially the
<HI>Tribunes,</HI> who, under colour of protecting
the People in their ju&s;t Rights, became
the Authors of mo&s;t of the Seditions, Tu|mults,
Murthers and civil Di&s;cord, which
happen'd in the mo&s;t bu&s;y Times of the
Common-wealth. As in <HI>Sparta</HI> the Power
of the Kings was too much re&s;train'd, &s;o
in <HI>Athens</HI> the Power of the People was too
exce&s;&s;ive; and nothing but &s;ome middle
Scheme between the&s;e Extremes, can be
&s;uppos'd to an&s;wer the true Ends of Go|vernment.
I might from hence take occa|&s;ion
to extol the Happine&s;s of our own
Con&s;titution, which is &s;o equally poiz'd by
a due Di&s;tribution of Power on the one
hand, and of Liberty on the other. But
perhaps &s;ome may think the Boundary
Lines between them are drawn &s;o fine, as
not to be ea&s;ily perceptible; at lea&s;t this is
<PB REF="22">
the mo&s;t plau&s;ible Pretence for the many
Party-Di&s;putes among us, and the be&s;t way
of accounting for our frequent Alarms and
Jealou&s;ies, le&s;t one Part of the Con&s;titution
&s;hould break in, and make Encroachments
upon the other. The&s;e are bad Effects,
but they proceed from a good Cau&s;e; and
however &s;ome Particulars may be affected
by them, they have &s;eldom gone &s;o far,
as to endanger the Safety of the Whole:
So that notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Inconveni|ences,
we are in the main much happier
than any of our Neighbours, who reproach
us with them; and our Liberty is better
&s;ecured to us, than it could be in any of
the Republicks of <HI>Greece,</HI> or in any of
tho&s;e Regal Governments in <HI>Europe,</HI> which,
tho' they were form'd upon the &s;ame Mo|del
with ours, have now very little Re|mains
of their original In&s;titution. I have
made a further Digre&s;&s;ion from my Subject
than I intended: But in &s;peaking of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Governments, and of tho&s;e which
have been grafted upon them, I could not,
as an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> re&s;i&s;t the Temptation of
&s;aying &s;omething in Preference of our own,
<PB REF="23">
which is certainly the neare&s;t to Perfection,
and is attended with very few Evils, but
&s;uch as are of our own making.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Greece,</HI> I have rather
cho&s;e to fini&s;h my Account of it with the
Death of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> than to carry
it on to his Succe&s;&s;or. For the Affairs of
<HI>Alexander,</HI> be&s;ides that they are already
related by others in a fuller and more un|broken
manner, than tho&s;e of the prece|ding
Times, are not, &s;trictly &s;peaking, to
be look'd upon as a Continuation of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Story, &s;ince they relate almo&s;t en|tirely
to <HI>Macedonia</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Some in|deed
of the <HI>Grecians</HI> took occa&s;ion, from
the Ab&s;ence of <HI>Alexander</HI> in his <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI>
Expedition, to attempt the Recovery of
their Liberty; but he &s;oon return'd upon
them; and by the De&s;truction of <HI>Thebes,</HI>
and the Victory afterwards obtain'd over
the <HI>Peloponne&s;ians</HI> by <HI>Antipater</HI> his Viceroy
in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> he &s;truck &s;uch a Terror into
the whole Country, that he kept them in
a quiet Subjection; &s;o that if he had liv'd
to return again into <HI>Grecce;</HI> he would have
found it very ea&s;y to annex it to his own
<PB REF="24">
Dominions, and to de&s;troy the very Name
of it. However the <HI>Grecians</HI> &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted,
but in &s;o low and lifele&s;s a Condition, that
from the Time of <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Captains, till
they were &s;ubdu'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> there
were very few among them, who were
di&s;tingui&s;h'd for Arms and Coun&s;els, and
not many for Arts and Learning: So that,
except the famous League of the <HI>Achaian</HI>
under <HI>Aratus</HI> and <HI>Philopoemen,</HI> and the En|deavours
of <HI>Agis</HI> and <HI>Cleomenes</HI> to recover
the State of <HI>Sparta</HI> from the Encroach|ments
of the <HI>Ephori,</HI> there is very little
worth recording.</P>

<P>_THE Victory of <HI>Ly&s;ander</HI> was
&s;o terrible a Shock to <HI>Athens,</HI>
that tho' &s;he gather'd Strength
enough to &s;urvive it, &s;he could
never perfectly recover it. From
a Pro&s;pect of bringing the War
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o an happy I&s;&s;ue, &s;he found her&s;elf in one Hour
<PB N="2" REF="28">
reduced to the lowe&s;t ebb of Fortune, and lay
at the Mercy of tho&s;e whom &s;he had &s;o lately in|&s;ulted:
For the Terms obtain'd by the la&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Treaty, amounted to little more than &s;urrender|ing
at Di&s;cretion. So that from hence we ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
date the <HI>Fall of the</HI> Athenian <HI>Empire,</HI> which be|gan
&s;oon after the Defeat of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> at <HI>My

However the Conquerors were &s;o generous, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P><PB N="3" REF="29">
Having &s;ettled his Conque&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ly&s;ander returns in triumph to Sparta.</NOTE> he returned in
triumph to <HI>Sparta</HI> with the <HI>Athenian</HI> and other
Gallies, and fifteen hundred Talents in Mony,
together with a great deal of rich Booty, be&s;ides
the Crowns of Gold and other Pre&s;ents which had
been made him by the &s;everal Cities. He &s;ent
the Mony to <HI>Sparta</HI> in &s;ealed Bags by <HI>Gylippus,</HI>
who, ripping up the bottom of the Bags, took
out as much as he thought fit, and then &s;ew'd
them up again. But there happen'd to be a
Note in each Bag, &s;pecifying the Sum contain'd
in it, which <HI>Gylippus</HI> not being appris'd of, the
Fraud by this means was detected: And there|upon,
either to avoid Puni&s;hment, or out of
Shame for having been guilty of &s;o mean an
Action, he bani&s;h'd him&s;elf, and never afterwards
appear'd in <HI>Sparta.</HI></P>
<P>There was a further Con&s;ideration in regard to
this Trea&s;ure, whether, according to the <HI>Spartan</HI>
Laws, it ought to be received into the City.
Many of the &s;obere&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;creet among
them oppos'd the introducing it; and they were
the more confirmed in their Opinion from this
In&s;tance of <HI>Gylippus,</HI> who, they found, had been
&s;o far influenc'd by Mony, as to give up every
thing el&s;e for it, and to &s;ully all the Glory of his
pa&s;t Actions: For he was otherwi&s;e a Man of
great Reputation, and had acquitted him&s;elf ex|tremely
well in the War of <HI>Sicily,</HI> where he had
the Command of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Troops: And it
was owing chiefly to him, that the <HI>Athenians</HI> did
<PB N="4" REF="30">
not make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of that I&s;land.
Hereupon the <HI>Ephori</HI> were obliged to pa&s;s a De|cree,
that none but the old Iron Mony of the
Country &s;hould be made current. But <HI>Ly&s;ander</HI>'s
Friends would not yet give it up: They re&s;umed
the Debate, and got the Decree revers'd, or at lea&s;t
&s;o far qualified, that this Mony, tho' it was to be
admitted into the City, was to be employ'd
only on publick Occa&s;ions; and it was made
capital to convert it to any private u&s;e. But
this did not an&s;wer the Intent of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI>
which was, by prohibiting the u&s;e of Gold and
Silver, to re&s;train Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Luxury.
<HI>Plutarch</HI> ob&s;erves upon this occa&s;ion, That the
ill Con&s;equence of Riches was not &s;o effectually
prevented, by forbidding the u&s;e of Mony in pri|vate,
as it was encouraged, by allowing it in pub|lick:
That therefore this &s;ort of Prohibition on|ly
heighten'd their De&s;ires; and that, if their
Actions did not pre&s;ently break out, at lea&s;t thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Affections were tainted. Whatever was pretend|ed
of laying in a Fund to &s;upply the Exigencie

it &s;often'd their Minds &s;o as to prepare
them for Corruption; and in &s;hort, was the fir&s;t
great Step towards their throwing off that rugged
Virtue, which di&s;tingui&s;h'd them &s;o much from
the re&s;t of <HI>Greece.</HI> This Change was owing in|tirely
to <HI>Ly&s;ander,</HI> who &s;acrificed every thing to
his O&s;tentation and Vanity, and &s;tuck at no Ex|pence
to gratify them. He erected his own, and
&s;everal of the chief Commanders Statues in Bra&s;s.
He was very liberal to tho&s;e of his Retinue,
and gave &s;uch Encouragement to the Poets, that
they complimented him with Songs of Tri|umph,
and employ'd all their Art in his Prai&s;es.
The <HI>Grecians</HI> in general were &s;o aw'd with his
Merit, that they erected Altars to his Honour,
and &s;acrificed to him as a God.</P>
<P>In the mean time while <HI>The Thirty</HI> in <HI>Athens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro|ceedings of <HI>The Thir|ty</HI></NOTE>

a colour to their Proceedings; their De&s;ign was

their next Step was to de&s;ire a Guard might be

Liberty with which they had &s;o long been pamper'd;
That all Changes of Government were attended
with Blood, and therefore it was no wonder that
they had &s;o many Enemies: But that it was unpar|donable
in one of their own Order to de&s;ert them,
and to betray that Power, which, by accepting a
Share of it, he had promi&s;ed to maintain. Thera|menes</HI>
made &s;o full and hand&s;om a Defence, that
the Senate were inclined to favour him: Which
<HI>Critias</HI> perceiving, and knowing that, as one of

much from the Unevenne&s;s of his Temper, as
from his Caution and Moderation, which made
him di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the Rule and the Ty|ranny.
He had &s;ome time before &s;hewn his In|clination

And in this latter In&s;tance, he &s;eems to have had

Remainder of the Citizens ca&s;t their Thought
on <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> and were &s;truck with Remor&s;e for
their la&s;t ill U&s;age of him. But as he had be|fore
overlook'd their Peevi&s;hne&s;s, and reliev'd
them in their Extremities; &s;o neither were they
now without hopes, that he might appear again
to re&s;cue them. And the Tyrants them&s;elves
were &s;o apprehen&s;ive of it, that they were very
&s;olicitous to get Intelligence of all his De&s;igns
and Actions. <HI>Critias</HI> at la&s;t repre&s;ented to <HI>Ly|&s;ander,</HI>
that either the Government, or <HI>Alcibiades</HI>
mu&s;t fall; and, after many Solicitations, &s;o far pre|vail'd,
that Orders were given to di&s;patch him.
He re&s;ided at that time in a &s;mall Village in
<HI>Phrygia,</HI> where he was making an Intere&s;t with
<HI>Pharnabazus,</HI> to recommend him to his Ma&s;ter
<HI>Artaxerxes. Ly&s;ander</HI> made it a Reque&s;t to
<HI>Pharnabazus,</HI> to deliver him up either alive or
dead; and laid &s;uch &s;tre&s;s upon it, that he &s;eem'd
to make it a Condition of the League between
the <HI>Spartans</HI> and the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> He con&s;ented to
it, and committed the Execution to his Brother
and his Uncle; who &s;urrounding the Hou&s;e,
where he dwelt with his Mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>Timandra,</HI> &s;et
fire to it. <HI>Alcibiades</HI> threw in great quantities of
Clothes and Furniture to choke the Flame; then
with his Robe on his left Arm, and his Sword
in the other hand, he made his way through it:
<PB N="11" REF="37">
Which the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins perceiving,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alcibiades</HI> murther'd.</NOTE> retreated, and
&s;lew him at a di&s;tance with their Darts and Ar|rows.
Some a&s;cribe this Murther to <HI>Pharnaba|zus</HI>
his own private Jealou&s;y of him; others to
the Re&s;entment of &s;ome young Noblemen who&s;e
Si&s;ter he had debauch'd. And others &s;ay, he had
got into the Secret of the Levy, that <HI>Cyrus</HI> was
making for the Expedition again&s;t his Brother,
and was endeavouring, by the Di&s;covery of it to
<HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> to ingratiate him&s;elf with that Prince,
and to procure his A&s;&s;i&s;tance for re-e&s;tabling the
Affairs of his Country; that therefore it became
nece&s;&s;ary to take him off. But whatever Cau&s;e
they a&s;&s;ign for his Death, they are generally a|greed
as to the manner of it; which indeed
was &s;uitable to that Extravagance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha|racter.</NOTE> with which
Fortune had all along treated him. And there|in
&s;he did but &s;econd the variety of Nature, who
&s;eems in his Compo&s;ition to have work'd up the
mo&s;t jarring Contradictions, and to have tried
how far &s;he could go, in reconciling the Ex|tremes
of Vice and Virtue. But it is to be
doubted whether his Virtues ought, upon a &s;trict
Examination, to bear that Name; and whether
they ought not rather to be call'd extraordinary
Talents and Endowments, and Ways of recom|mending
him&s;elf. They had more of Artifice
and De&s;ign, of Popularity and O&s;tentation, than
of any real Principle of Honour and ju&s;tice, or
Love of his Country. And therefore <HI>Valcrius
Maximus</HI> makes it a que&s;tion, Whether his good
<PB N="12" REF="38">
or bad Qualities were mo&s;t hurtful to the Pub|lick:
<HI>By the former,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>he deceived his Fel|low-Citizens,

Overthrow by <HI>Ly&s;ander.</HI> His View in the&s;e En|terpri&s;es,
was not only to procure Honour to
him&s;elf, but al&s;o to make him&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary, and
to keep the People employ'd, &s;o that they &s;hould
not be at lei&s;ure to inquire into his Conduct.
He likewi&s;e found his account in the Pre&s;ents
that were made him abroad, and in that re&s;pect
he was both greedy and corrupt; and yet his ta|king
them was not &s;o much for the &s;ake of the
Mony, as to &s;upport his Popularity and Luxu|ry.
His natural bent was certainly Plea&s;ure; and
yet as much as he lov'd it, he made it give way
to his Ambition: But he was &s;o violent, and
withal &s;o irregular and capricious in the Pur&s;uit
of it, that there was no living with him upon
any equal &s;ooting. He was any thing, and every
thing, by fits and &s;tarts, and ju&s;t as it &s;uited his
pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; one while for the <HI>Oligarchy,</HI> and
then as great a Stickler for the <HI>Democracy;</HI> one
while in the <HI>Spartan</HI> Intere&s;t, in order to re|venge
him&s;elf of his Country, and then in the
<HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> in order to be reconcil'd to it. The
<PB N="13" REF="39">
People, it mu&s;t be confe&s;'d, were no le&s;s une|qual
and incon&s;tant in their behaviour to him;
from whence it happen'd, that, according to
the Temper they were in, or according to the
occa&s;ion they had for his Service, he was look'd
upon as the be&s;t or wor&s;t Member of the Com|mon-wealth,
and was either care&s;s'd and ador'd,
or dete&s;ted and per&s;ecuted. And yet, upon the
whole, they had &s;uch an opinion of his Merit,
that tho' they were never ea&s;y with him, they
never thought them&s;elves &s;afe without him. <HI>Plu|tarch</HI>
makes a Remark, That his Enemies could
never get the better of him but in his Ab&s;ence;
which mu&s;t be attributed to his Subtilty and
Addre&s;s, and more e&s;pecially to the Amiablene&s;s
of his Per&s;on, and the Force of his Eloquence,
which <HI>Nepos</HI> &s;ays, No body could re&s;i&s;t. But
tho' by the&s;e means he captivated the generality
of the Citizens; yet the grave&s;t and mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
among them &s;aw further into the Di&s;|gui&s;e,
and were more upon their guard again&s;t
him. Upon this occa&s;ion the Warning that was
given them by <HI>Timon</HI> the <HI>Man-hater,</HI> of what
they were to expect from him, may be worth re|membring.
It happen'd one Day, that <HI>Alcibia|des</HI>
having &s;ucceeded well in an Oration, the
whole A&s;&s;embly attended to compliment him
upon it; and <HI>Timon,</HI> in&s;tead of avoiding him,
as he did others in the like Ca&s;es, put him&s;elf in
his way, and taking him by the Hand, &s;aid, <HI>Go
on boldly, my Son; may'&s;t thou increa&s;e in Credit
<PB N="14" REF="40">
with the People; for thou wilt one Day bring them
Calamities enough.</HI> He was &s;carce above forty
Years old when he died; by which time he had
done enough to make him&s;elf by turns the Sup|port
and Terror, not only of his own Country,
but of &s;everal other Parts both in <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia.</HI>
And he had been &s;till greater, if he had been as
careful to pre&s;erve the People's Love, as he was
to obtain it. But the Management of Pro&s;peri|ty
was not his Talent: And therefore the faire&s;t
View of him is to be taken from his Suffer|ings;
which, as they were often unju&s;t, &s;et off
his good Qualities to a greater Advantage, and
con&s;equently made his Fall the more lamented,
e&s;pecially at a time when he was &s;o much wanted.
Having given a general Character of this great
Man, when I fir&s;t mention'd him, I have here
only added &s;uch further Ob&s;ervations, as were
nece&s;&s;ary to illu&s;trate it, and which have natural|ly
occur'd upon a more di&s;tinct Survey of his
Actions.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants not being able to bear the &s;e|vere
Treatment they met with from <HI>The Thirty,</HI>
fled daily in great numbers out of the City, by
which means all <HI>Greece</HI> was over&s;pread with <HI>Athe|nian</HI>
Exiles; till at la&s;t the <HI>Spartans</HI> publi&s;hed an
Edict, forbidding any of their Cities to receive
them; &s;o that they were forced to betake them|&s;elves
to <HI>Thebes</HI> and <HI>Argos,</HI> and &s;uch other Places,
where they could live in any tolerable Security.</P>

The fir&s;t who appear'd to &s;tem this Torrent,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thra&s;ybu|lus</HI> oppo&s;es <HI>The Thir|ty.</HI></NOTE> 
was <HI>Thra&s;ybulus,</HI> who had done good Service in
the <HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI> War; in&s;omuch that <HI>Alcibiades</HI>
is &s;aid to owe mo&s;t of his Succe&s;s to his acting
in concert with him: But his Merit being not
of &s;o glaring a kind, was in a great mea&s;ure
eclips'd by that General, till it broke out upon
this occa&s;ion of exerting him&s;elf alone, and in
&s;uch a Cau&s;e as the Subver&s;ion of Tyranny. At
<HI>Thebes</HI> he fell into a Con&s;ultation with his Fel|low-Citizens;
and the Re&s;ult was, That &s;ome
vigorous Effort, tho' it carried never &s;o much
Danger with it, ought to be made for the Re|covery
of the publick Liberty: Accodingly,
with a Party of Thirty Men only, as <HI>Nepos</HI> &s;ays;
but, as <HI>Xenophon</HI> more probably &s;ays, of near Se|venty,
he &s;eized upon <HI>Phyle</HI> a &s;trong Ca&s;tle on
the Frontiers of <HI>Attica.</HI> This Enterpri&s;e gave
the Alarm to <HI>The Tyrants,</HI> who immediately
march'd out of the City with <HI>The Three Thou|&s;and,</HI>
and their <HI>Spartan</HI> Guard, and attempted the
Recovery of the Place, but were repuls'd with
lo&s;s. Finding they could not carry it by a &s;ud|den
A&s;&s;ault, they re&s;olved upon a Siege; but be|ing
not &s;ufficiently provided for that Service, and
a great Snow falling that Night, they were forced
to retire the next Day into the City, leaving on|ly
part of their Guard, to prevent any further
Excur&s;ions into the Country.</P>
<P>By this fir&s;t Succe&s;s <HI>Thra&s;ybulus</HI> had increas'd
his Followers to the number of Seven hundred;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Suc|ce&s;s.</NOTE> 
<PB N="16" REF="42">
with which he made a Sally upon the Guards, and
di&s;pers'd and routed them, with the Slaughter of
about an hundred and twenty. <HI>The Thirty</HI> in the
mean while, were under great Con&s;ternation;
and for &s;ear of Treachery from tho&s;e few who
were left in the City, they forced them to
quit it. Then they fortified <HI>Eleu&s;is,</HI> to &s;erve
them upon any &s;udden Exigency, as a Place of
Retreat. And, to free them&s;elves from any Jea|lou&s;y
the Inhabitants might give them, they
cau&s;ed all who were able to bear Arms, to
pa&s;s One by One, as it were upon a Re|view,
in order to compute the Strength of
the Garri&s;on, and murder'd them. At the
&s;ame time they attempted to corrupt <HI>Thra&s;y|bulus,</HI>
and &s;ent under colour of treating about
Pri&s;oners, to make him a private Offer of

<P>By
this time he had got together a Body of
a thou&s;and Men; with which he march'd out of
<PB N="17" REF="43">

them of the Cau&s;e they were engaged
in, and the Succe&s;s they had hitherto met with,
and offer'd the Enemy Battle; wherein he ea&s;i|ly
obtain'd the Victory; which indeed was more

<P>A Truce being granted for delivering up the

be deceived in my Opinion of you; but &s;hew your
&s;elves worthy of that Liberty which you enjoy, and
which I think preferable to all other Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.
Con&s;ider only who you have to do with, and no|thing
can happen in the Engagement to di&s;hearten
you. The Enemy indeed is very numerous, and will
ru&s;h upon you with great Shouts and Acclamations;
but if you can &s;tand this fir&s;t Eclat, you your &s;elves

to the Danger of his Enterpri&s;e; but that,
after the Battle, he would forget them; or that, if
he did not, he would not have it in his Power to

nor the other by rea&s;on of the Cold. All that lies
between the&s;e Two Extremes, it will be in my
Power, if I am victorious, to be&s;tow on my Friends.
Neither am I &s;o much afraid of not having enough
to give, as of not having Men enough to give it to.
And as for you, <HI>Grecians,</HI> I promi&s;e to give every
Man of you a Crown of Gold. <HI>Upon which A&s;|&s;urances,

<P>Upon a general Review of his Army,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He</HI> re|views his Army.</NOTE> he
found it compo&s;ed of Ten Thou&s;and and Four

the le&s;t, and march'd in order of Battle,
expecting every Hour to engage. But the Ene|my
having left a Pa&s;s open to him, which he
thought they would have di&s;puted, he pur&s;ued
his March with more Security, and le&s;s Order,
till at la&s;t being arrived at the Place where he
intended to encamp, he di&s;cover'd the King's
<PB N="29" REF="55">
Army by a thick Cloud of Du&s;t, and prepar'd
to receive them. He order'd <HI>Clearchus</HI> to charge
directly into the Center, where the King was;
for that thereupon depended the whole Succe&s;s of
the Battle: But the Enemy being &s;o numerous,
that one of their Wings would cover the whole
Front of <HI>Cyrus's</HI> Army, he thought it not ad|vi&s;eable
to abandon the River, for &s;ear of being
&s;urrounded by them; which <HI>Plutarch</HI> blames him
for, as having left that Service to <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and
thereby occa&s;ion'd his Death. When he had let
the Enemy advance within four or five hundred
Paces of him, the <HI>Grecians</HI> began the Hymn to
Battle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle.</NOTE> and march'd up to them with great Ac|clamations.
But before they were got within
reach of their Javelins, the <HI>Barbarians</HI> fled, and
the <HI>Grecians</HI> after them, calling out to one ano|ther,
not to break their Ranks in the Pur&s;uit.
<HI>Cyrus</HI> perceiv'd the <HI>Grecians</HI> were victorious, yet
was not tran&s;ported with it, tho' he was alrea|dy
&s;aluted King by tho&s;e about him. At length
he di&s;cover'd the King his brother in the mid&s;t
of the Battle; and for fear he &s;hould fall upon
the <HI>Grecians</HI> in their Pur&s;uit, and cut them off,
he made up directly to him with Six Hundred
Hor&s;e, and with his own Hand kill'd <HI>Artager&s;es,</HI>
who commanded the King's Six Thou&s;and Hor&s;e
But when he had broke their Squadrons, all
his own People abandon'd him, except a few of
his Dome&s;ticks, with whom he charg'd on to
the King, and crying out, <HI>I &s;ee him,</HI> threw a Ja|velin

at him, and wounded him in the Stomach;
but at the &s;ame time receiv'd a Wound him&s;elf
under his Eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cyrus kill'd.</NOTE> and was kill'd upon the Spot,
with eight of his principal Attendants. The
King order's his Head and right Hand to be cut
off; and then pu&s;h'd on to <HI>Cyrus's</HI> Camp, in pur|&s;uit
of <HI>Ariaeus,</HI> who commanded his Hor&s;e, and
had fled as &s;oon as he had heard of his Ma&s;ter's
Death. The <HI>Grecians</HI> at the &s;ame time were in
pur&s;uit of one part of the King's Army, whil&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
the other part of it were plundering their Camp;
&s;o that both &s;ides thought them&s;elves victorious.
The King return'd upon them in the &s;ame Or|der
of Battle as at fir&s;t; but the <HI>Barbarians</HI> fled
again on all &s;ides upon the Approach of the
<HI>Grecians,</HI> who being very much fatigued, and
Night drawing on, returned to their Camp, not
knowing what was become of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> but expect|ing
his Orders the next Day to compleat their
Victory. When the News arrived to them the

<HI>Ti&s;&s;aphernes;</HI> wherein, among other things, he
a&s;&s;ur'd him of their Fidelity, in regard to the

had prevented it, out of a De&s;ire to oblige them

Confu&s;ion, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> &s;ent to them a &s;econd
time, in the King's Name, to lay down their
Arms, pretending that <HI>Clearchus</HI> was executed,
as having been accu&s;ed by <HI>Proxenus</HI> and <HI>Menon</HI>
of perfidiou&s;ly de&s;igning to break the Truce;
and that his Accu&s;ers were &s;ent for to be reward|ed
by the King for their Di&s;covery. But <HI>Xeno|phon</HI>
&s;u&s;pecting the Treachery, demanded, that
<HI>Proxenus</HI> and <HI>Menon,</HI> as being innocent, and com|mon
Friends to both, might be re&s;tored to
them, as the propere&s;t Per&s;ons to advi&s;e them in
this Exigency. To which the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> not
knowing what to reply, went away. Immedi|ately
after, <HI>Nicarchus,</HI> one of the Captains who
had attended the Generals, came, wounded in
the Belly, and holding up his Entrails with his
Hand, to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Camp, and told them all
the Particulars of what had happen'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Five <HI>Grecian</HI> Generals executed.</NOTE> The five
Generals were &s;ent back to the King, who caus'd
them all to be beheaded, except <HI>Menon,</HI> who
&s;uffer'd &s;ome other way after a Year's Torture.
It does not appear, why he was di&s;tingui&s;hed in
this manner from the re&s;t; tho' indeed there was
&s;ome Ju&s;tice in it in regard to his Character,
which was as extraordinary as his Treatment.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="62">
He was by Birth a <HI>The&s;&s;alian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cha|racter of Menon.</NOTE> covetous and
ambitious; but who made his Ambition all along
&s;ub&s;ervient to his Avarice, and had no other
View in his Pur&s;uit of Honour, but to get by it.
He &s;ought the Friend&s;hip of Men in Power, on|ly
to &s;creen him from Puni&s;hment. He con|cluded
the readie&s;t way to obtain his Ends, was
by Perjury, Lying and Fraud; and took Can|dor
and Openne&s;s for Stupidity. He loved no
body; and wherever he profe&s;s'd a Freind&s;hip,
it was in order to en&s;nare. He did not laugh at
his Enemies, but always made a Je&s;t of his
Friends. So neither did he attempt to defraud
his Enemies of their Property, as knowing they
were too much upon their Guard again&s;t him:
But his Friends, who were not &s;o, he fleec'd and
plunder'd. And he valued him&s;elf as much up|on
his Inju&s;tice and Fal&s;hood, as others did upon
their Religion and Virtue: For he thought none
but Cheats were to be look'd upon as Men of
Addre&s;s. He made his way to Great Men by
traducing their Favourites. His manner of &s;up|porting
his Authority among the Troops, was
by committing the &s;ame Crimes with them. He
endeavour'd to make him&s;elf fear'd by the Mi&s;|chief
he could do you; and you were to take it
as an Obligation, that he did not do it, when it
was in his Power. He gain'd the Favour of
<HI>Ariaeus</HI> in his Youth, by abandoning him&s;elf to
his unnatural Pa&s;&s;ion; and he prevail'd the &s;ame
way with <HI>Ari&s;tippus</HI> for his Command in the
<PB N="37" REF="63">
Army. Some have imagin'd that he was par|don'd
by <HI>Artaxerxes;</HI> and conclude from thence,
that he was engag'd in a De&s;ign of betraying the
<HI>Grecians</HI> to him; which, according to his Prin|ciples,
might ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed: But however,
this Account of him does not appear to be well
founded.</P>
<P><HI>Clearchus</HI> was a <HI>Spartan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Clear|chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></NOTE> and e&s;teem'd one of
the greate&s;t Captains of his Time. He had done
good Servie to his Country in the <HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI>
War, and was intirely devoted to the Love of
Arms; in&s;omuch that he laid out all his Mony
in War, and with the &s;ame Gu&s;t and Appetite,
with which others laid it out upon their Plea|&s;ures.
Hence it was, that upon the Peace, he
de&s;ir'd leave to go and cha&s;ti&s;e the <HI>Thracians,</HI>
who had committed &s;ome In&s;ults upon the <HI>Cher|&s;one&s;e.</HI>
Soon after he was gone, the <HI>Ephori</HI>
changed their Minds, and recall'd him; and
tho' they pa&s;'d Sentence of Death upon him
for di&s;obeying their Orders, he proceeded on his
March, beat the <HI>Thracians</HI> in a pitch'd Battle,
ravaged their Country, and continued the War,
till he enter'd into <HI>Cyrus's</HI> Service; where he was
pitch'd upon as the propere&s;t Man to command
the <HI>Grecians</HI> in this Expedition: And he had Ta|lents
&s;uitable to &s;o hardy an Undertaking. He
was &s;evere in his Looks, and har&s;h in his Speech;
he always puni&s;h'd &s;harply, and &s;ometimes in
Anger, but generally with Di&s;cretion. He was
very &s;trict in his Di&s;cipline; and it was a Saying
<PB N="38" REF="64">
of his, <HI>That a Soldier ought to be more afraid of
his Officer, than of his Enemy.</HI> Upon Action,
his Men de&s;ir'd no other General; for he then
appear'd mild to them, and re&s;erv'd all his
Fiercene&s;s for the Enemy: But when the Danger
was over, he re&s;umed his Natural Roughne&s;s,
and many of them, as they found opportunity,
left him. None of them follow'd him out of
Inclination; but lived with him, as Boys do with
their School-ma&s;ters. However, he did every
thing with them by dint of Puni&s;hment; and
the Sum of his Character is, that he was more fit
to command, than to obey.</P>
<P><HI>Proxenus</HI> was a <HI>Boeotian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Proxe|nus.</HI></NOTE> and of an a&s;piring
Temper, which had engaged him in this Ser|vice;
tho' he did nothing in the Pur&s;uit of his
Ambition, but what was con&s;i&s;tent with Honour
and Virtue. He was capable enough of Com|mand,
but was too much the Rever&s;e of <HI>Clear|chus.</HI>
He had not the way of making him&s;elf
fear'd, where it was nece&s;&s;ary: For he was more
afraid of being ill with the Soldiery, than the
Soldiery with him. He thought it &s;ufficient to
commend good Actions, without puni&s;hing the
bad: For which rea&s;on he was beloved by tho&s;e
who acted upon Principles of Honour; but bad
Men took advantage of his Ea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Agias</HI> was an <HI>Arcadian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Agias</HI> and <HI>So|crates.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Socrates</HI> and <HI>Achaean;</HI>
they had both lived without Reproach, either as
to their Military, or their Civil Conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="65">
The <HI>Grecians</HI> had, ever &s;ince the Battle of <HI>Cy|rus,</HI>
been &s;o upon their guard, and were withal
&s;o bold and re&s;olute, that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> de&s;pair'd
of &s;ubduing them by open Force, and therefore
had recour&s;e to this treacherous Stratagem, which
had &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that the Lo&s;s of the Gene|rals
was very near breaking and di&s;per&s;ing the
whole Body. The News of it &s;truck them with
the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation: They expected every
Moment when they &s;hould be attacked in their
Camp: They con&s;ider'd that they were at the
very Gates of the King; &s;urrounded with great
Rivers; in the mid&s;t of many Nations their
Enemies; &s;ix or &s;even hundred Leagues from
<HI>Greece;</HI> without Officers to lead them; in want
of all manner of Provi&s;ions, and of Means to
get any; be&s;ides that they had no Cavalry; and
therefore if they were victorious, could not pur|&s;ue
their Enemies; and if they &s;hould happen to
be defeated, mu&s;t every Man of them be cut off.
In the&s;e perplexing Thoughts they pa&s;s'd the
Night without Sleep, de&s;pairing ever to &s;ee their
Native Country more.</P>
<P>It was upon this Occa&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Xenophon</HI> and others &s;ucceed in the Com|mand.</NOTE> that <HI>Xenophon</HI> &s;ig|nalized
him&s;elf. He was an intimate Friend of
<HI>Proxenus,</HI> who had invited him into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and
pre&s;ented him to <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who had al&s;o expre&s;s'd a
particular E&s;teem for him; but hitherto he had
&s;erved only as a Voluntier in the Army. The
next Morning he a&s;&s;embled the Officers, and re|pre&s;ented
to them the Mi&s;ery of their Condition;
<PB N="40" REF="66">
That they could expect no Mercy from the King,
if they fell into his Hands; to prevent which,
they had nothing to depend upon, but their own
Per&s;onal Bravery; and that no time ought to be
lo&s;t in providing for their Defence. He there|fore
advi&s;ed to choo&s;e new Officers in the Place
of tho&s;e who were murther'd, and to re&s;olve to
make their way home in the be&s;t manner they
could. Accordingly, they cho&s;e <HI>Tima&s;ion</HI> in the
room of <HI>Clearchus, Xanthicles</HI> in that of <HI>Socra|tes,
Cleanor</HI> in that of <HI>Agias, Phile&s;ius</HI> in that of
<HI>Menon,</HI> and <HI>Xenophon</HI> in that of his Friend <HI>Proxe|nus.</HI>
He having encourag'd the Army with a
long Harangue in prai&s;e of their Ance&s;tors, pro|pos'd
to them, for the Safety and Expedition of
their Return, to burn their Tents, Carriages,
and all unnece&s;&s;ary Baggage, and to march in
the form of a hollow Square, that, in ca&s;e they
&s;hould be attack'd, they might be prepar'd to
receive the Enemy with a Front either way. All
which being approv'd of, <HI>Cheri&s;ophus</HI> the <HI>Spart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI>
led the Van, and <HI>Tima&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Xenophon</HI> brought
up the Rear.</P>
<P>They bent their March towards the Heads of
the great Rivers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Gre|chians</HI> pur|&s;ue their March.</NOTE> in order to pa&s;s them where
they were fordable: But they had made very lit|tle
way before they were follow'd by a Party of
the Enemies Archers and Slingers, commanded
by <HI>Mithridates,</HI> which gall'd their Rear, and
wounded &s;everal of them, who being heavy|arm'd,
and without Cavalry, could make no

Re&s;i&s;tance. To prevent the like Inconvenience,
<HI>Xenophon</HI> furni&s;h'd two hundred <HI>Rhodians</HI> with
Slings, and mounted fifty more of his Men up|on
Baggage-Hor&s;es; &s;o that when <HI>Mithridates</HI>
came up with them a &s;econd time, and with a
much greater Body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Barba|rians</HI> re|puls'd by them.</NOTE> he repuls'd them with this
Handful of Men, till he arrived near to the
City <HI>Lari&s;&s;a</HI> on the Banks of the <HI>Tigris.</HI>
From thence they march'd to another de&s;olate
City call'd <HI>Mep&s;ila;</HI> and about four Leagues
from that Place, <HI>Ti&s;&s;aphernes</HI> came up to them
with his whole Army in Order of Battle; but,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">fter &s;everal Skirmi&s;hes, was forc'd to retire. In
a few Days after, he &s;ecured an Eminence, over
which the <HI>Grecians</HI> were obliged to make their
way: Which <HI>Xenophon</HI> perceiving, took a De|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">achment
of the Army, and with great Dili|gence
gain'd the Top of a Mountain which
commanded that Eminence, from whence he ea|sily
di&s;lodg'd the Enemy, and made good a Pa&s;|&s;age
for the re&s;t of hsi Troops into the Plain,
where they found Plenty of Provi&s;ions, tho' <HI>Ti&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aphernes</HI>
had done what he could before, to

<P>But &s;till they were under as great Difficulties
as ever, being bounded on the one hand by the

inhabited by the <HI>Carduchi,</HI> a &s;ierce and

However, having no Boats to cro&s;s the River, and

their March that way. The&s;e <HI>Barbarians</HI>
&s;oon took the Alarm; but not being prepar'd to
meet them in a Body, they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves
of the Tops of the Rocks and Mountains, and
from thence annoy'd them with Darts and great
Stones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are attack'd by the <HI>Cardu|chi.</HI></NOTE> which they threw down into the Defiles

their Lo&s;s was not con&s;iderable, yet, what with

<HI>Harpa&s;us;</HI> and from thence at a rich populous
City call'd <HI>Gymnias.</HI> They were very well re|ceiv'd
by the Governour of the Province, who

in five Days within Sight of the Sea;<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are within Sight of the Sea.</NOTE> at which

in the mean time receiving Advice of their Con|dition,

<P><HI>Pharnabazus,</HI> who fear'd they would be &s;trong

been practi&s;ing with <HI>Cleander,</HI> the Governor of
<HI>Byzantium,</HI> and <HI>Anaxibius,</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> Admiral,
to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible Means to ha&s;ten their Depar|ture.
Accordingly <HI>Anaxibius</HI> got them out of
the City Gate, under a pretence of reviewing
them, and told them, They would meet with
Plenty of Provi&s;ions in the <HI>Thracian</HI> Villages, and
that they &s;hould proceed to the <HI>Cher&s;one&s;e,</HI> where he

<PB N="49" REF="75">
Sovereignty of <HI>Greece,</HI> and had <HI>Athens</HI> in their
Alliance: That this would involve their Country
in a dangerous War, and them&s;elves in inevitable

to make their Retreat to the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> or any of
the Countries thro' which they had forc'd their
Pa&s;&s;age, or to return home; to which he added,
how much it would &s;ully the Glory of their <HI>Re|treat,</HI>
That after having &s;pared &s;o many of the
<HI>Barbarian</HI> Cities, they had plunder'd the fir&s;t they
came to in their own Country, and murder'd &s;o
many of their Friends and Relations. This Ha|rangue
had &s;o good an effect, that they imme|diately
chang'd their Re&s;olution, and march'd
out of the City without committing the lea&s;t Di&s;|order;
which was intirely owing to <HI>Xenophon,</HI>
who to the Courage and Conduct he had &s;hewn
in every Circum&s;tance of the <HI>Retreat,</HI> had added
this extraordinary In&s;tance of his Mildne&s;s and
Humanity, and the Force of his Eloquence. And
this was te&s;tified of him at large in a Letter from
<HI>Chio,</HI> a Philo&s;opher then in the Town, to a Friend
of his, wherein he tells him, <HI>He had been an Eye|witne&s;s
of the Skill and Temper, with which</HI> Xeno|phon
<HI>had allay'd the Fury of the Soldiers; that he
could not forbear going to thank him as the Author
of his Deliverance, and was &s;truck with the Sight of
a Man, who had nothing terrible or &s;evere in his

&s;o well how to reduce Philo&s;ophy to Practice.</HI></P>

The Troops being thus appeas'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Xenophon</HI> leaves the Army,</NOTE> <HI>Xenophon</HI>

<P>They had no &s;ooner re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd him in his

&s;hould receive all fitting Encouragement, if they
would a&s;&s;i&s;t him. <HI>Seuthes</HI> not being able to pay
them their Arrears, and having no further Occa|&s;ion
for them, did what he could to encourage the
Propo&s;al; tho' they were of them&s;elves de&s;irous
enough to &s;erve again in the Cau&s;e of their Coun|try;
be&s;ides that they were glad of &s;uch an Occa|&s;ion
of revenging the Treachery of <HI>Ti&s;&s;aphernes</HI>
to them in their Retreat: So that they ea&s;ily gave
into it, and were &s;o warm upon it, that an <HI>Arca|dian</HI>

added, That as to his part, what little he had, he
would freely give to &s;ee him &s;toned to death.
Another &s;tood up, and &s;econded this Motion;
and a third &s;poke to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. He made
it appear in his An&s;wer to this Charge, that he
had acted in every thing for the Good and Safety
of the Army; that, as to his own particular, he
had not receiv'd the Rewards which were pro|mi&s;ed

other Captains; and appeal'd to <HI>Seuthes</HI> him&s;elf

they gave him no other Name, than that of <HI>Fa|ther,

that any &s;uch Number of them &s;hould e&s;cape, as

<PB N="53" REF="79">
of a numberle&s;s Army, that could neither take
them by Force, nor circumvent them by Strata|gem;
That they &s;hould traver&s;e the Body of that

all Sides, to di&s;pute their Pa&s;&s;age over Rocks and

the <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates;</HI> and all this with the
Countenance rather of Conquerors, than of de|&s;pairing
&s;ucce&s;sle&s;s Adventurers, expo&s;ed to the
Fury of a powerful incen&s;ed Monarch with a
victorious Army: the&s;e are Circum&s;tances, which
would not ea&s;ily gain Credit, if they had not been
de&s;crib'd and atte&s;ted by <HI>Xenophon,</HI> who has done
it with &s;uch Exactne&s;s and Fidelity, and at the
&s;ame time with &s;uch Mode&s;ty in regard to him|&s;elf,
that the only Doubt remaining, is, whether
he gain'd more Honour by the Share he had in
the Expedition, or by the Account he has given
of it.</P>
<P>But it is time now to return to <HI>Greece,</HI> which
we left chiefly under the Direction of the <HI>Spar|tans,</HI>
who contenting them&s;elves with the Sub|mi&s;&s;ion
of the &s;everal States to them at home,
were meditating other great De&s;igns, and re&s;olv'd
to pu&s;h their Conque&s;ts abroad. The fir&s;t Occa|&s;ion
that offer'd, was from the <HI>Ionians:</HI> They
were afraid of the Power of <HI>Ti&s;&s;aphernes,</HI> who, as
a Reward for the Service he had done <HI>Artaxerxes</HI>
in the late War with his Brother <HI>Cyrus,</HI> had the
Government of all the Cities he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in
tho&s;e Parts, conferr'd on him; and therefore
<PB N="54" REF="80">
they begg'd A&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>Sparta</HI> to &s;upport
them in their Liberties. Their Reque&s;t was ea&s;ily
granted; and a Body of Five Thou&s;and Men,
with Three Hundred <HI>Athenian</HI> Hor&s;e, were &s;ent
to them, under the Command of <HI>Thimbron,</HI> who
appear'd among them, but would not venture to
take the Field, till he was join'd by the Re|mainder
of the <HI>Ten Thou&s;and</HI> at <HI>Pergamus;</HI> with
which Forces he took that, and &s;everal other ill-fortified
Towns, and then laid Siege to <HI>Lari&s;&s;a.</HI>
But before he could take it, he was recall'd by
the <HI>Ephori,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thimbron</HI> recall'd, and ba|ni&s;h'd.</NOTE> and bani&s;h'd, for having &s;uffer'd the
Soldiers to pillage the Countries of their Allies;
and was &s;ucceeded in the Command by <HI>Dercyl|lidas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Athens,</HI>
during the Time of <HI>the Expedition of
the Ten Thou&s;and,</HI> and the breaking out of this
fre&s;h War in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> was very quiet with its Neigh|bours,
and endeavouring to recover it&s;elf from its
late Confu&s;ions in the Government at home. But
there were &s;till &s;ome Seeds of Rancour and Ma|lice
left among the Citizens, which, two Years
after the Expul&s;ion of <HI>the Thirty,</HI> broke out upon
<HI>Socrates,</HI> and occa&s;ion'd his Death. The chief
In&s;trument in it was <HI>Anytus,</HI> who engag'd <HI>Melitus</HI>
and <HI>Lycon</HI> to join with him in accu&s;ing him to the
State. Accordingly <HI>Melitus</HI> drew up his Accu&s;a|tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Socrates <HI>accus'd</HI></NOTE> containining in Sub&s;tance, <HI>That he did not ac|knowledge
the Gods of the Republick, but introduced
new Deities in their room;</HI> and further, <HI>That he
corrupted the Youth.</HI> He urg'd in his Defence,
<PB N="55" REF="81">
That he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His De|fence.</NOTE> as others did, at the Sacri|fices
and &s;olemn Fe&s;tivals, and appeal'd to <HI>Me|litus</HI>
him&s;elf for the Truth of it. He denied his
endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h any new Wor&s;hip: He
own'd indeed, he had receiv'd frequent Admo|nitions
from a <HI>Divine Voice,</HI> which he call'd his
<HI>Daemon,</HI> that con&s;tantly attended him, and di&s;|cover'd
to him Things to come; that he had of|ten
made u&s;e of this Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance for the Ser|vice
of him&s;elf and his Friends: But that if he
had been thus particularly favour'd from Heaven,
it was owing chiefly to the Regularity of his Life
and Conduct; and that the Approbation of the
Gods, which was given him as the Reward of his
Virtue, ought not to be objected to him as his
Crime. Then as to the other Article, wherein
he was branded with a criminal Pa&s;&s;ion for young
Men, he &s;aid, He had no other View in his Con|ver&s;ation
with them, than to regulate their Mo|rals;
that as he could not do this with any pub|lick
Authority, he was therefore forc'd to in&s;i|nuate
him&s;elf into their Company, and to u&s;e in
a manner the &s;ame Methods to reclaim, that o|thers
did to corrupt them.</P>
<P>How far the whole Charge affected him, is not
ea&s;y to determine. It is certain, that amid&s;t &s;o
much Zeal and Super&s;tition as then reign'd in
<HI>Athens,</HI> he never dur&s;t openly oppo&s;e the receiv'd
Religion, and was therefore forc'd to pre&s;erve an
outward Shew of it: But it is very probable,
from the Di&s;cour&s;es he frequently held with his
<PB N="56" REF="82">
Friends, that in his Heart he de&s;pis'd and laugh'd
at their mon&s;trous Opinions, and ridiculous My&s;|teries,
as having no other Foundation, than the
Fables of the Poets; and that he had attain'd to
a Notion of the <HI>One, Only, True God;</HI> in&s;o|much
that, upon the account both of his Belief of
the Deity, and the Exemplarine&s;s of his Life,
&s;ome have thought fit to rank him with the
<HI>Chri&s;tian Philo&s;ophers.</HI> And indeed his Behaviour
upon his Trial, was more like that of a <HI>Chri&s;tian
Martyr,</HI> than of an <HI>Impious Pagan;</HI> where he
appear'd with &s;uch a compos'd Confidence, as
naturally re&s;ults from Innocence, and rather, as
<HI>Cicero</HI> ob&s;erves, as if he were to determine upon
his Judges, than to &s;upplicate them as a Cri|minal.</P>
<P>But
how &s;light &s;oever the Proofs were again&s;t
him, the Faction was powerful enough to find
him guilty. There was the Form of a Proce&s;s
again&s;t him, and his Irreligion was the Pretence
upon which it was grounded; but his Death was
certainly a concerted thing. His &s;teady uninter|rupted
Cour&s;e of ob&s;tinate Virtue, which had
made him in many Ca&s;es appear &s;ingular, and
oppo&s;e whatever he thought illegal or unju&s;t,
without any Regard to Times, or Per&s;ons, had
procur'd him a great deal of Envy and Ill-will:
In&s;omuch that he had, &s;everal Years before, been
publickly attack'd upon the Stage in the <HI>Play,</HI>
call'd <HI>The Clouds,</HI> where he is introduc'd as the
Author of many gro&s;s Impieties; which &s;ome
<PB N="57" REF="83">
&s;ay, <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> wrote out of a per&s;onal Pique to
him; others, that he did it only according to the
Liberty then indulg'd to the Stage, and intended,
in the Per&s;on of <HI>Socrates,</HI> to expo&s;e and ridicule
the Philo&s;ophers in general. But mo&s;t are of
Opinion, that it was at the In&s;tigation of <HI>Anytus,</HI>
who look'd upon him as a dangerous Man, and
took that Method of preparing the People for his
Condemnation, whenever an Opportunity &s;hould
offer. This agrees with the Terms propo&s;ed to
him, even after the Accu&s;ation was given in, when
perhaps he was not &s;ure of carrying his Point a|gain&s;t
him: He hinted to him, that if he would
talk le&s;s freely, and not take upon him to cen&s;ure
and arraign the Admini&s;tration, he would yet en|deavour
to &s;tifle the Affair, and &s;ave him. It
was upon the &s;ame Account, that he was forbid
conver&s;ing with the young Men: Tho&s;e at the
Helm were jealous of his tampering with them in
relation to the Government; and this &s;eems to be
the Grounds of that Part of his Accu&s;ation. But
he was not to be bought by Bribes, or deter'd by
Menaces; in &s;hort, he had more Plainne&s;s and
Integrity than the Times would bear; and there|fore
fell a Sacrifice to the Corruption of tho&s;e,
whom his Hone&s;ty had made his Enemies.</P>
<P>It was a Privilege in <HI>Athens,</HI> after Conviction,
to demand a Mitigation of the Puni&s;hment: But
that, he &s;aid, would be owning him&s;elf guilty;
and he cho&s;e rather to defy and incen&s;e his
Judges; &s;o that they unanimou&s;ly pa&s;s'd Sentence
<PB N="58" REF="84">
of Death upon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is con|demn'd,</NOTE> by drinking the Juice of
Hemlock, which was not put in execution till
thirty Days after;<NOTE PLACE="marg">and exe|cuted.</NOTE> during which Time, he con|ver&s;ed
with his Friends with the &s;ame Evenne&s;s
and Serenity of Mind he had ever done: And
tho' they had bribed the Jailor for his E&s;cape,
he refus'd it, as an ungenerous Violation of the
Laws. He was about &s;eventy Years old when he
&s;uffer'd; which made him &s;ay, he thought him|&s;elf
happy to quit Life at a Time when it begin
to be trouble&s;ome; and that his Death was ra|ther
a Deliverance, than a Puni&s;hment. This

where in earne&s;t, when they moved again&s;t
them as one Soul and Body, when they laid a&s;ide
all dome&s;tick Di&s;&s;en&s;ions, to pur&s;ue the com|mon
Enemy; and, in &s;hort, acted upon no
other Principle than the Love of Liberty, and
the Defence of their Country. This was the
plain, hardy and untainted Age of <HI>Greece,</HI>
which might have been of a much longer Du|ration,
if its Inhabitants had contented them|&s;elves
with the Glory they had acquired at home.
But the&s;e Succe&s;&s;es &s;oon fired them with an Am|bition
of making them&s;elves more formidable,
by enlarging their Bounds, and extending their
Conque&s;ts: So that by throwing them&s;elves out
in Colonies, and carrying their Arms abroad,
they had a freer Conver&s;e with other Nations:
And as by this means they arrived to quicker
degrees of Knowledge and Politene&s;s; &s;o on the
other hand, they became more luxurious and ef|feminate,
and more open to the Charms and
Temptations of Riches. They received the fir&s;t
Impre&s;&s;ions of this kind from the Footing they
got in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> where they were &s;truck and dazzled
with the Pomp, Wealth and Magnificence of
the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Governors: And tho' in all the Ac|tions
they had there, they &s;till behaved like <HI>Gre|cians,</HI>
and with a Sen&s;e of Glory; yet they ex|pre&s;s'd
too great an Eagerne&s;s to enrich them|&s;elves
with Plunder. In &s;hort, the Love of
Mony was now rooted in their Affections; and
it &s;oon after vi&s;ibly appeared in the Effects it
<PB N="70" REF="96">
produced. For as the <HI>Grecians</HI> had been bribed
to quit their Preten&s;ions in <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> &s;o others af|terwards
made u&s;e of the &s;ame Methods to in|vade
<HI>Greece:</HI> And this will appear in the Sequel
of the Story, to be one of the principal Cau&s;es
of its total Subver&s;ion. As the <HI>Spartans</HI> kept
up longe&s;t to the Rigour of their Di&s;cipline,
and the Force of their Laws, they were a great
while proof again&s;t Corruption and Bribery;
but the Contagion &s;till &s;preading, they at la&s;t
yielded to the Example of their Neighbours.
It was then <HI>Greece</HI> became &s;o divided and irre|&s;olute,
as to admit of no means for its Pre&s;erva|tion;
when not only each State, but al&s;o the
leading Men in that State, had &s;eparate Views
of their own, without any regard to the Good of
the Whole.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thebans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>The|bans</HI> en|gage the <HI>Athenians</HI> in the Quarrel.</NOTE> as they were the fir&s;t gain'd over
to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Intere&s;t, &s;o they were the mo&s;t
active in promoting it. To &s;trengthen their
Alliance, they &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adors to the <HI>Athe|nians,</HI>
with a long Repre&s;entation of the pre|&s;ent
Po&s;ture of Affairs; wherein they artfully
in&s;inuated their Zeal and Affection to their
State; from thence they took occa&s;ion to in|veigh
again&s;t the Tyranny of <HI>Sparta,</HI> and con|cluded
with telling them, That now was the
Time to throw off the Yoke, and to recover
their former Splendor and Authority. The <HI>Athe|nians,</HI>
tho' they had no Share of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>
Mony, needed not many Arguments to engage
<PB N="71" REF="97">
them in a Rupture of this kind, for which they
had been &s;o long waiting a fit Opportunity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Act of Ho&s;tility broke out between
the <HI>Locri Opuntii,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ho&s;tilities begun.</NOTE> and the <HI>Phocians,</HI> upon a
Di&s;pute about a piece of Ground; and both
Sides appeal'd to their re&s;pective Confederates
for Ju&s;tice and Protection. The <HI>Locri</HI> were the
Aggre&s;&s;ors, at the In&s;tigation of the <HI>Thebans;</HI>
and the <HI>Spartans</HI> e&s;pou&s;ed the latter, upon a
particular Pique they had to <HI>Thebes,</HI> which they
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;ent at this time, when
they found &s;everal other States arming again&s;t
them. Accordingly, they ordered <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> to
march with the <HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI> Forces, and &s;ent
<HI>Ly&s;ander</HI> before to engage other Cities in <HI>Boeo|tia;</HI>
where having got together a con&s;iderable
Army, he inve&s;ted <HI>Haliartus.</HI> The <HI>Thebans</HI> im|mediately
marched with their whole Strength;
and taking the Advantage of attacking him,
before <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> could come up to his A&s;&s;i&s;|tance,
defeated his Army,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ly&s;ander</HI> kill'd.</NOTE> and he him&s;elf was
kill'd on the Spot.</P>
<P>Thus fell this great Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha|racter.</NOTE> after &s;o many &s;ig|nal
Services to his Country, in giving <HI>Athens</HI> the
mo&s;t fatal Blow &s;he had ever received; and in
rai&s;ing <HI>Sparta</HI> upon her Ruins, to a higher Pitch
of Power and Grandeur than &s;he ever attain'd,
either before or after him. As it was by his
means, that <HI>Sparta</HI> did at this time, in a man|ner,
give Law both to <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> &s;o he
him&s;elf became no le&s;s ab&s;olute in <HI>Sparta,</HI> than
<PB N="72" REF="98">
&s;he was among her Enemies and Allies. The
Authority of her Kings was &s;ufficiently abridged
by the Con&s;titution: but by his working Ge|nius,
and the Intere&s;t he had in the State upon
the Reputation of his Services, he made them
appear &s;till le&s;s, and that in the Field too, where
they were lea&s;t &s;ubject to be controuled. An In|&s;tance
of which we have in his going with <HI>Age|&s;ilaus</HI>
into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> where all the Court and Applica|tion
was made to him; and in every thing that
pa&s;s'd of moment, he had either the fir&s;t hand,
or the fini&s;hing Stroke: In&s;omuch that the King
found him&s;elf obliged to take notice of it; and
that he might no longer appear a Cypher, &s;ent
him upon other Service to the <HI>Helle&s;pont.</HI> Nei|ther
was it enough for him to eclip&s;e the Power
of the Kings, and to impo&s;e his own Govern|ment
of <HI>Ten Men</HI> upon all the <HI>Spartan</HI> Con|que&s;ts;
but he was further endeavouring to al|ter
the Succe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Heraclidae,</HI> in order to
obtain the Sovereignty for him&s;elf. As a Con|firmation
of this, there was found among his
Papers after his Death, <HI>A Di&s;cour&s;e concerning the
Government,</HI> which <HI>Lacratidas</HI> generou&s;ly &s;up|pre&s;s'd,
&s;aying, <HI>It would be inhumane to dig</HI> Ly|&s;ander
<HI>out of his Grave.</HI> He was undoubtedly a
brave experienc'd Commander: But his Di&s;&s;i|mulation,
Craft and Treachery, his Ambition,
Arrogance and O&s;tentation, make up the great|e&s;t
part of his Character; and therefore it may
&s;eem pretty extraordinary, that he &s;hould &s;upport
<PB N="73" REF="99">
him&s;elf &s;o long under &s;o jealous and au&s;tere a
Government, as that of <HI>Sparta.</HI> But he had a
great deal of Artifice and Addre&s;s; and notwith|&s;tanding
the Imperiou&s;ne&s;s of his Temper, he
knew how to curb it upon occa&s;ion, and to &s;uit
it to his Circum&s;tances: So that where he found
it nece&s;&s;ary to make his Court, he was, con|trary
to the Manners of his Country, very mild
and tractable, patient and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and had
all the little Arts of Flattery and In&s;inuation.
It was with regard to the&s;e &s;upple Qualities, as
well as to the Badne&s;s of his Morals in general,
that the Character of his Countryman <HI>Callicrati|das,</HI>
has been &s;et up in oppo&s;ition to his; and
indeed it was quite the Rever&s;e of it, except in
the Military Part; and in that he was no way in|ferior
to him: But he was otherwi&s;e open, can|did
and generous, mode&s;t, temperate, &s;incere
and ju&s;t, and was above making u&s;e of any Trick
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">or Subterfuge. <HI>Ly&s;ander</HI> was &s;o jealous of his
Merit, that when he was order'd to give up the
Command of the Fleet to him, he did what he
could to le&s;&s;en and di&s;tre&s;s him: He went &s;o far
as to withold from him the Pay of the Seamen
that was remaining in his Hands; which, be&s;ides
the Meanne&s;s of the Action, was betraying the
Intere&s;t of his Country, and hazarding the Safety
of it in a very critical Conjuncture. Upon the
whole, notwith&s;tanding his great Atchievements,
he is not to be look'd upon as a true Patriot.
For it &s;eems chiefly owing to him, that the
<PB N="74" REF="100">
<HI>Spartans</HI> tran&s;gre&s;s'd the ju&s;t Bounds of Power he
had put into their Hands. It was his Pride and
In&s;olence, his cruel and tyrannical Deportment,
and that under the Pretence of re&s;toring Liberty,
which gave their Neighbours the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions
of Rancour and Re&s;entment again&s;t them. It
was this that made them conceive an ill Opinion
of their Government in general, and laid the
Seeds of tho&s;e Alliances, which were form'd a|gain&s;t
them, and which at la&s;t prov'd fatal to
them. But they were not yet &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the
Con&s;equences; and therefore paid all due Re&s;pect
to his Memory. They went &s;o far as to fine
&s;ome who were under a Contract of Marriage to
his Daughters, but finding, that their Father died
&s;o poor as to leave them no Fortune, had de|&s;erted
them. It is certain, he had re&s;erv'd no|thing
to him&s;elf out of the Spoils of the <HI>Atti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
War; which to the <HI>Spartans</HI> was a &s;ufficient Ar|gument
of his Merit. A &s;tronger In&s;tance of the
Sen&s;e they had of his Lo&s;s, was, that they could
pitch upon nobody but <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> to &s;ucceed him;
who, notwith&s;tanding that he was carrying on the
War in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> with good Succe&s;s, was immediately
recall'd to the Defence of his Country.</P>
<P>After the Action <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> came up, but dur&s;t
not make another Attempt. He only demanded
the Bodies of the &s;lain; and yet could not obtain
them upon any other Terms than quitting the
Country.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> condemn'd</NOTE> The <HI>Spartans</HI> judg'd his Proceedings
very di&s;honourable, and condemn'd him to Death<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="75" REF="101">
upon which he made his E&s;cape to <HI>Tegea,</HI> and
died there.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the Year <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> ra|vag'd
the Government of <HI>Pharnabazus,</HI> and at
<HI>Da&s;cyllum,</HI> his Winter Quarters, took and plun|der'd
his Tent. But that Governor &s;ome time
after manag'd an Interview with him, wherein
he remon&s;trated, That however he might be
oblig'd to act for his Ma&s;ter's Honour, and
Safety, he had not &s;hew'd him&s;elf an Enemy to
the <HI>Spartans,</HI> but on the contrary had done them
many good Offices in their War again&s;t the <HI>A|thenians;</HI>
and that he was now inclin'd to act no
otherwi&s;e again&s;t them, than as he &s;hould be ne|ce&s;&s;itated
to it, in order to &s;upport him&s;elf in his
Command; by which Means he prevail'd with
<HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> to withdraw his Forces out of the Pro|vince.
Thereupon he de&s;cended into the Plain
of <HI>Thebes;</HI> and as he was preparing to march
further into the Country, receiv'd News of the
War broke out in <HI>Greece,</HI> with Orders at the
&s;ame time for him to return home; with which
he readily comply'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Age&s;ilaus <HI>recall'd from</HI> A&s;ia. Olymp. 96. 3.</NOTE> And the Regard he therein
paid to the Laws of his Country, is particularly
taken notice of, that when he was pro&s;ecuting
the War with great Increa&s;e of Honour and Ad|vantage,
and had &s;et his Heart upon the entire
Conque&s;t of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Empire, he had &s;o much
Command of him&s;elf, as to &s;top in his full Ca|reer,
and abandon all, out of a Deference to the
<HI>Ephori,</HI> who had recall'd him. However, he
<PB N="76" REF="102">
left Four Thou&s;and Men in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> to maintain the
Footing he had got there, till &s;uch time as the
Affairs of <HI>Greece</HI> would permit him to return,
and pur&s;ue his Conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Spartans</HI> could not wait his Arrival;
they found the War thicken on their Hands, and
were ready to be attack'd on all Sides. <HI>Timolous</HI>
a <HI>Corinthian</HI> propos'd the advancing immediately
into their Territories, in order to cru&s;h them
&s;ingly, before they could be join'd by their Auxi|liaries.
<HI>They &s;et out,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>by them&s;elves only;
but in their March they gather Forces as they go,
till they grow too numerous to be with&s;tood: Like
Rivers, which are &s;mall at their Source, and ea&s;ily
to be forded; but as they continue their Cour&s;e, the
Acce&s;&s;ion of other Waters makes the Stream too
rapid.</HI> This Advice was judg'd rea&s;onable, and
a Re&s;olution was taken to pur&s;ue it. But there
being too much Time &s;pent in debating the
Command, and Order of the Battle, gave the
<HI>Spartans</HI> an Opportunity of being join'd by the
<HI>Eleans, Sicyonians, Epidaurians, Trezaenians</HI> and
others, to the Number of about Fourteen Thou|&s;and
Men, and Thirteen Hundred Hor&s;e, under

were the <HI>Athenians, Argives, Boeotians, Corin|thians</HI>
and <HI>Euboeans,</HI> who made up about Two
and twenty Thou&s;and Men, and Two Thou&s;and
Hor&s;e. Both Sides encamp'd near <HI>Sicyon,</HI> and

recover'd the Day, and gain'd the Victory by

<P>The News of this Victory reaching <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> at

<HI>A&s;ia,</HI> to confirm the a&s;&s;ociated Cities there, and
pur&s;u'd his March with all po&s;&s;ible Diligence, but
not without &s;ome Oppo&s;ition, particularly from
the <HI>Thralli</HI> in <HI>Thrace,</HI> who having formerly &s;old
the Pa&s;&s;age thro' their Country to <HI>Xerxes,</HI> de|manded
of him an hundred Talents, and as many
Women. He ask'd them, by way of Deri&s;ion,
<HI>Why they did not come to receive their Demands?</HI>
And proceeding on his Journey, made great
Slaughter of them. Then demanding a Pa&s;&s;age
thro' <HI>Macedonia,</HI> the King &s;ent him Word, <HI>He
would con&s;ider of it. So let him,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Age&s;ilaus;

did not much reli&s;h this <HI>Laconick</HI> An&s;wer; but
they were not as yet in a Condition to re&s;ent it,
and therefore gave him no Di&s;turbance. Having

&s;u&s;pected, and to inveigh again&s;t him as the chief
Incendiary of the War, and as having promoted
it with no other View, than to aggrandize the
<HI>Athenians</HI> at the Expence of the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> The
Charge in fact was true, and it was urg'd &s;o

thought it proper to &s;eize him, and keep

he died about this Time, and that he fell
a Sacrifice to his own ill-tim'd Zeal for the Ser|vice
of his Country;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Conon</HI>'s Death, and Character.</NOTE> which certainly carried him
further than was &s;uitable to the Circum&s;tances he
was under. He had lived as a voluntary Exile
among the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who had given him their
Protection and A&s;&s;i&s;tance; he had been favour'd
and tru&s;ted by them; he had, by intere&s;ting' em
in his Quarrel, broke the Power of <HI>Sparta</HI> at Sea,
and repair'd the Ruins of his own City, and both
at their Charge and Hazard. But not content
with this, he was at the &s;ame time practi&s;ing a|gain&s;t
them, and endeavouring under-hand to
withdraw from them &s;everal Cities, and the whole
Provinces of <HI>Ionia</HI> and <HI>Aeolia,</HI> in order to annex
<PB N="84" REF="110">
them to the Dominions of <HI>Athens;</HI> and all this
under a Pretence of re&s;cuing them from the Ty|ranny
of <HI>Sparta,</HI> and &s;ecuring them to the <HI>Per|&s;ians.</HI>
They could not, when they were let into
a Di&s;covery of the&s;e Artifices, think he had made
a &s;uitable Return for what he ow'd them; nor
indeed can this Part of his Character be otherwi&s;e
ju&s;tified, than by that fal&s;e Principle, which had
generally obtain'd among the <HI>Grecians,</HI> to give
up every thing that interfered with what they
call'd the Honour, or Advantage of their Coun|try.
This was carried &s;o far, as, in &s;ome Ca&s;es,
to de&s;troy the common Di&s;tinctions of Right and
Wrong; and the <HI>Spartans</HI> them&s;elves, notwith|&s;tanding
their &s;evere Ju&s;tice in other Re&s;pects,
were &s;o loo&s;e in this particular, that nothing was
e&s;teem'd ba&s;e, that was beneficial. Another
Motive for his exerting him&s;elf in &s;o extraordi|nary
a manner, might be in order to redeem his
own Honour, which does not &s;eem to &s;tand quite
clear in the Affair of <HI>Aegos-potamos. Nepos</HI> in|deed
&s;ays, he was ab&s;ent from his Command at
the Time of that Engagement; and a&s;&s;igns that
as the Cau&s;e of the Defeat. But the mo&s;t na|tural
and authentick Account is, that he was
pre&s;ent in the Action, but that being over|power'd
by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ander,</HI> and &s;eeing no Probability
of Succe&s;s on his Side, made his E&s;cape with
eight or nine Ships, and retir'd to <HI>Cyprus.</HI> This
agrees with what is further &s;aid of him, that
he was afraid and a&s;ham'd to return to <HI>Athens;</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="111">
which it is plain he did not attempt till &s;everal
Years after, when he had done enough to wipe
off that Stain. The latter Part of his Life was
certainly without Reproach, either as to his
Courage, or Capacity; of both which he had
given &s;ufficient Proofs, and had made him&s;elf &s;o
formidable to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> that they were glad
upon any Terms to get rid of him; and it was
by the mo&s;t abject Submi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI>
that they compa&s;s'd it. The Dread they had
conceiv'd of him, &s;eems to have been the Grounds
of that &s;candalous Peace, which they &s;oon after|wards
concluded: And as they began from that
Day forward to decline in their Reputation and
Power, we may look upon <HI>Conon</HI> as having more
remotely occa&s;ion'd their DownfaI.</P>
<P>Upon the Offers of Peace made to <HI>Teribazus,</HI>
he went up to <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> to give an Account
of his Proceedings, and to receive fre&s;h In&s;tru|ctions.
In the mean time <HI>Struthas</HI> was &s;ent to
command in the <HI>Lower A&s;ia,</HI> and to take care
of the Sea-Coa&s;ts. He was not &s;o well inclin'd
to the <HI>Spartans</HI> as his Predece&s;&s;or, being more
exa&s;perated at what had been done by <HI>Age&s;ilaus.</HI>
Whereupon they &s;ent <HI>Thimbron</HI> with a good Body
of Troops to keep him in Action; which he did
at fir&s;t with good Succe&s;s; but ranging about
with a &s;eparate Party in que&s;t of Booty, was
&s;urpriz'd by <HI>Struthas,</HI> and kill'd. He was &s;uc|ceeded
by <HI>Diphridas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thimbron</HI> kill'd. Succeeded by <HI>Diphri|das.</HI></NOTE> who was a Man of better
Conduct, at lea&s;t of more Caution; and he having

his Ground in the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aces which had &s;ub|mitted

<P>There were at this Time two contending Par|ties
at <HI>Rhodes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commoti|ons at</HI> Rhodes. Olymp. 97. 3.</NOTE> concerning the Form of Govern|ment
there; and they were &s;upported by their
re&s;pective Patrons, tho&s;e for the <HI>Democracy</HI> by
the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and the others for the <HI>Oligarchy</HI>
by the <HI>Spartans.</HI> The latter being over-power'd,
and forc'd off the I&s;land, made their Complaints
at <HI>Sparta;</HI> and <HI>Ecdicus</HI> was di&s;patch'd with eight
Ships to their Relief. But finding him&s;elf too
weak to do any thing to the Purpo&s;e, <HI>Teleutias</HI>
the Admiral was &s;ent with twenty-&s;even Sail,
with which he re&s;tor'd the Exiles, and the <HI>Oli|garchy.</HI>
This was a Matter of too much Con&s;e|quence
to the <HI>Athenians</HI> to be given up. They
were &s;en&s;ible how much their Sovereignty in the
I&s;land (which was truly the Point in Que&s;tion)
depended on the Form of Government, which
&s;hould prevail in it; and therefore &s;ent out <HI>Thra|&s;ybulus</HI>
to put Things upon the former footing.
Before he dur&s;t attempt any thing at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> he
went into <HI>Thrace,</HI> where he gain'd over two
<HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Princes to the <HI>Athenian</HI> Intere&s;t; he then
took in <HI>Byzantium, Chalcis,</HI> and &s;everal other
Cities upon the <HI>Helle&s;pont;</HI> and from thence he
went to cha&s;ti&s;e the <HI>Lesbians,</HI> who were all of
them, except tho&s;e of <HI>Mitylene,</HI> in the <HI>Spartan</HI>
Intere&s;t. Having &s;ucceeded thus far, he &s;ail'd
towards <HI>Rhodes.</HI> He had in his Way levied a

Sum of Mony for Contribution upon the Inha|bitants
of <HI>A&s;pendus:</HI> But they being afterwards
ill treated by his Soldiers, ro&s;e in a great Fury,
and murder'd him in his Tent.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thra&s;ybu|lus</HI> mur|der'd. His Cha|racter.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such was the End of this great Patriot, to
whom <HI>Athens</HI> ow'd as &s;ignal a Deliverance, as
any &s;he had receiv'd in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Wars. We
need only con&s;ider her Condition under the Ty|ranny
of <HI>The Thirty;</HI> when of tho&s;e who had
e&s;cap'd the Fate of a long War, &s;ome had been
murder'd, others bani&s;h'd, and their E&s;tates con|fi&s;cated;
when the City was one continu'd Scene
of Outrage and Violence; and when tho&s;e few
good Men who &s;till remain'd, and expre&s;s'd a
Sen&s;e of recovering the publick Liberty, yet
cho&s;e rather to content them&s;elves with talking
of it, than really to attempt it: Yet even then
did <HI>Thra&s;ybulus</HI> ri&s;e in a manner &s;ingly again&s;t
the united Power of the Oppre&s;&s;ors. It having
been already related with what Prudence, Zeal
and Intrepidity he conducted that Affair, I will
here only add an Ob&s;ervation which has been
made, that the Succe&s;s of this Enterprize was
chiefly owing to its de&s;peratene&s;s. For the Con|tempt,
with which <HI>The Thirty</HI> treated it in the
Beginning, made them neglect the proper Means
of providing for their Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">fety. <HI>Thra&s;ybulus</HI> in the
mean time went on with his De&s;ign, and en|creas'd
his Followers: And when they &s;ound
him in a Condition to make head again&s;t them,
they thought fit to make him an Offer of &s;haring
<PB N="88" REF="114">
in the Tyranny with them, upon Condition he
would de&s;i&s;t. But it was not to be &s;uppos'd, that
one who had the Courage to project &s;uch an En|terprize,
and who had advanc'd it &s;o far, would
hearken to any other Terms, than the entirely
re&s;toring the Freedom of his Country. His pub|lick-&s;piritedne&s;s,
together with his Fidelity, Con|&s;tancy
and Magnanimity, made him at lea&s;t
equal to the greate&s;t Men of his Time. There
were &s;everal indeed, who&s;e Atchievements hap|pen'd
to make a greater Noi&s;e in the World:
But none of them had a more real Foundation
of Merit. And therefore <HI>Nepos</HI> &s;ays of him,
<HI>That if Virtue were to be con&s;ider'd ab&s;tractedly
from Fortune, he &s;hould be inclin'd to give</HI> Thra|&s;ybulus

Some other little States they treated le&s;s rigo|rou&s;ly,

they were not regular and deci&s;ive Battles, they
were &s;uch as &s;erv'd to rai&s;e their Courage, and

tho&s;e greater Actions which happen'd afterwards.
The Succe&s;s of the&s;e little Engagements was ge|nerally

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ome Hor&s;e: But receiving Intelligence, that a
great Body of <HI>Spartans</HI> were upon their March
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o reinforce the Garri&s;on, he thought it advi&s;eable
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o retire. In his Retreat, he met this Reinforce|ment
near <HI>Tegyra,</HI> and being oppos'd by them,
he order'd his Hor&s;e, who were in the Rear, to
advance and engage them, relying on his Foot
for the main Stre&s;s of the Battle. The Attack
was very furious on both Sides: But <HI>Gorgoleon</HI>
and <HI>Theopompus,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Spartans,</HI>
&s;oon &s;ell; and all who were near them, were ei|ther
kill'd, or put to Flight; which &s;truck &s;uch
a Terror into the re&s;t of their Troops, that they
open'd a Pa&s;&s;age for the <HI>Thebans</HI> to pur&s;ue their
March. But <HI>Pelopidas</HI> would not quit the Field,
till he had made a further Slaughter among 'em,
and thoroughly routed and di&s;pers'd them. He
acquir'd more Reputation by this Retreat, than
he could have got by &s;ucceeding in his original
De&s;ign again&s;t <HI>Orchomenus:</HI> And it was a more
&s;ignal Di&s;grace to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> than they had
hitherto met with; for they had at lea&s;t three
times as many Men in the Field. And it was
never known before, that in all their Wars, whe|ther
again&s;t <HI>Grecians</HI> or <HI>Barbarians,</HI> they had
been beat by fewer Troops than their own, or
even by an equal Number. It mu&s;t indeed be
allow'd, that the&s;e three hundred Foot were the
Flower of the <HI>Theban</HI> Army; and they were di|&s;tingui&s;h'd
by the Name of <HI>The Sacred Battalion.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sacred Battali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE> 
They were as remarkable for their Fidelity and

Courage, and in that re&s;pect were likewi&s;e call'd,
<HI>The Band of Lovers.</HI> There are &s;everal fabulous

rea&s;onably collected from them, is, that they
were a brave determin'd Set of young Men, who
had vow'd perpetual Friend&s;hip, and &s;worn to
&s;tand by one another to the la&s;t Drop of their
Blood. They were &s;aid to have been fir&s;t rais'd
by <HI>Gorgidas,</HI> who was one of the Governors of
<HI>Boeotia,</HI> in Conjunction with <HI>Pelopidas,</HI> and had a
con&s;iderable Share in the Tran&s;actions of that
Time. He us'd them chiefly as a Guard to the
Citadel, but employ'd them occa&s;ionally in other
Services of the War; and upon an Engagement,
he cho&s;e to divide and mix them in the Ranks
with the other Troops, in order to animate them
by their Example. But <HI>Pelopidas</HI> found a better
Effect in keeping them in one entire Body; and
after the Proofs they had given him of their Be|haviour
in this Action, he con&s;tantly charg'd at
the Head of them, in the &s;ame manner, without
breaking and di&s;per&s;ing them. They are &s;aid to
have remain'd invincible till the Battle of <HI>Che|ronea,</HI>
which happen'd &s;ome Years after, when
they were every Man of them cut down by the
<HI>Macedonian Phalanx:</HI> And the next Day <HI>Philip</HI>

knew of what Importance that I&s;land was to the
Recovery of their Dominion at Sea; and their
true De&s;ign was to &s;ecure it to them&s;elves. The
Fraud being detected, the Inhabitants in general
united again&s;t them as their common Enemy, and
put them&s;elves under the Protection of <HI>Athens.</HI>
But before they could receive any Relief from
thence, the <HI>Spartans</HI> had landed upon them, and
be&s;ieged them. And when they found them|&s;elves
&s;traiten'd for want of Provi&s;ions, they made
a de&s;perate &s;ally, wherein they kill'd <HI>Mna&s;ippus,</HI>
with a good Number of his Men. At length
<HI>Iphicrates</HI> and <HI>Timotheus</HI> coming up with the <HI>A|thenian</HI>

and upon their breaking with them, the Affairs
of <HI>Greece</HI> took a new and unexpected Turn.</P>
<P><HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Sparta</HI> began now to think in
earne&s;t of enjoying &s;ome Repo&s;e them&s;elves,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Sparta</HI> incline to Peace.</NOTE> and
of giving it to the le&s;&s;er States, who&s;e Quarrels

pretended Cau&s;es were a&s;ign'd; of which the
mo&s;t plau&s;ible was, the &s;ettling the other Cities
and Republicks in a State of Freedom and Inde|pendency.
This was now in &s;ome mea&s;ure ef|fected;
and the <HI>Spartans</HI> having been forc'd to
give up a great Part of the Power they had un|ju&s;tly
obtain'd, the <HI>Athenians</HI> contented them&s;elves
with this Mark of their Submi&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially
&s;ince they had recover'd a great Part of what
they had lo&s;t at Sea; which had brought things
to a pretty equal Balance. The Truth is, they
had been at almo&s;t all the Charge and Hazard of
the War, exclu&s;ive of their Allies; &s;o that not|with&s;tanding
they had been &s;ucce&s;sful in the main,
they had been &s;ufficiently drain'd and hara&s;s'd,
and were therefore glad of &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">avourable a Con|juncture,
to renew the former Treaty. There
<PB N="117" REF="143">
being at the &s;ame time nothing to apprehend on
the Side of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> where <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> was deeply
engag'd in his <HI>Aegyptian</HI> War, there was a ge|neral
Di&s;po&s;ition for Peace, and the Negotiations
were carried on &s;ucce&s;sfully by the <HI>Athenians;</HI>
but it was rejected by the <HI>Thebans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>The|bans</HI> aver &s;e to it.</NOTE> and in &s;uch a
manner, as plainly &s;hew'd they were now &s;etting
up for them&s;elves, and would no longer be con|&s;ider'd
as a &s;ubordinate State.</P>
<P>They were naturally an hardy and robu&s;t Peo|ple,
but had the Character of being heavy and
&s;tupid, even to a Proverb: And yet &s;uch Gene|rals
as <HI>Epaminondas</HI> and <HI>Pelopides,</HI> and &s;uch Wri|ters
as <HI>Pindar</HI> and <HI>Plutarch,</HI> one would think,
&s;hould have vindicated them from that Reproach.
However it is certain, they had not hitherto ex|erted
them&s;elves in any Degree &s;uitable to the
Fame of their Heroes and Founders, who by
their Exploits, partly Fabulous, and partly Hi&s;|torical,
had given a Promi&s;e of what might be
expected from their De&s;cendants, e&s;pecially in a
City of &s;o great Antiquity and Renown, as to
have maintain'd a Siege, even before that of
<HI>Troy.</HI> But they were far from an&s;wering the&s;e
Expectations. The <HI>Thebans</HI> were divided in In|tere&s;t
from the <HI>Boeotians</HI> during the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Wars;
which is a&s;&s;ign'd as one Rea&s;on, why they were
&s;o long kept under: They ba&s;ely de&s;erted the
common Cau&s;e of <HI>Greece</HI> at that Time, to join
with the <HI>Barbarians:</HI> And when, contrary to all
human Probability, that numerous Army was
<PB N="118" REF="144">
defeated, they apprehended the Power and Re|&s;entment
of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who, as being their
Neighbours, might, under a Pretence of puni&s;h|ing
their Treachery, po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of their
Country. This Nece&s;&s;ity threw them under the
Protection of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> who cho&s;e rather to
forgive the Friends of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> than &s;acrifice the
Enemies of <HI>Athens;</HI> and accordingly enter'd into
a League with them. The <HI>Thebans</HI> were not un|grateful;
they did them very great Service in the
<HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI> War, and continu'd, during the
whole Cour&s;e of it, their good and faithful
Allies. Upon what Occa&s;ion they afterwards
broke with them, and were thereupon oblig'd
to have Recour&s;e to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> has already
been related. It was a con&s;tant Maxim with
them, as they were de&s;erted by one of tho&s;e two
States, to fall in with the other; and which Side
&s;oever they inclin'd to, they were generally of
Weight enough to turn the Balance: However
they had hitherto made no further u&s;e of that
Weight, than to &s;ecure them&s;elves. But they
had been &s;o con&s;tantly engag'd of late Years on
one Side or the other, according to the Exigencies
of their Affairs, that it had brought them into
Di&s;cipline, and fir'd their Ambition; and the
<HI>Spartans</HI> had principally contributed to it, by
their late &s;requent Expeditions again&s;t them. It
was an e&s;tabli&s;h'd Point of Policy in the <HI>Spartan</HI>
Government, to avoid engaging too often with
the &s;ame Enemy, for fear of in&s;tructing them in
<PB N="119" REF="145">
the Art of War: And <HI>Lycurgus</HI> had, for the
&s;ame Rea&s;on, expre&s;ly forbid it by his Laws.
But the Re&s;entment of <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> again&s;t the <HI>The|bans</HI>
carried him on beyond any Con&s;ideration of
that kind; in&s;omuch that finding his Colleague
<HI>Cleombrotus</HI> aver&s;e to the <HI>Theban</HI> War, he lead
the Army him&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding that he had
before claim'd the Privilege of his Age to excu&s;e
his Attendance: And an Action happening,
wherein he was wounded, <HI>Antalcidas</HI> reproach'd
him, <HI>That he was well requited by the</HI> Thebans,
<HI>for having taught them to fight.</HI> In &s;hort, they
began now to look about them, and enlarge their
Views; and finding them&s;elves too much cramp'd
up within their ancient Limits, they laid hold of
the pre&s;ent Conjuncture, to extend their Domi|nion,
beginning, as the other States had done,
by little Encroachments on their Neighbours.</P>
<P>The Spirit which now appear'd among them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are encourag'd by <HI>Pelopi|das</HI> and <HI>E|paminon|das.</HI></NOTE> 
had been rais'd by <HI>Pelopidas,</HI> their late Deliverer
from the <HI>Spartan</HI> Yoke, and was &s;econded and
&s;upported by <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> who, tho' he had all the
Qualities nece&s;&s;ary for the Service of the Publick,
yet cho&s;e to lead a private Life, in a con&s;tant
Cour&s;e of Virtue, and the Study of Philo&s;ophy.
He had &s;eldom appear'd in publick, but in order
to get him&s;elf excus'd from tho&s;e Employments,
which were &s;o eagerly courted by others. But
his extraordinary Merit no longer &s;uffering him
to enjoy his Retirement, he was forc'd out of it,
and plac'd at the Head of the <HI>Theban</HI> Army.
<PB N="120" REF="146">
He had before this contracted an Intimacy with
<HI>Pelopidas,</HI> which was daily improv'd by the Cor|re&s;pondence
of their Tempers and Principles, and
the ardent Zeal, which they both expre&s;s'd, for the
Good of their Country. And they had upon
&s;ome Occa&s;ions before this Time appear'd toge|ther
in Action: But <HI>Pelopidas</HI> having made a
more early Figure in the Army, the Succe&s;s,
which the <HI>Thebans</HI> had hitherto met with, was
generally a&s;crib'd to him: However <HI>Epaminondas</HI>
had done enough to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf; and
they both now came to be con&s;ider'd in the &s;ame
Light, as Generals abroad, and as Governors at
home.</P>
<P>When the Treaty propos'd by the <HI>Athenians</HI>
was upon the Point of being executed, the <HI>The|bans</HI>
demanded to be comprehended in it, under
the Name of the <HI>Boeotians,</HI> and to be expre&s;ly
&s;tiled &s;o. But the other contracting Powers
would not agree to it: <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> particularly in|&s;i&s;ted
upon their leaving <HI>Boeotia</HI> free and inde|pendent.
He was an&s;wer'd by <HI>Epaminondas,</HI>
who was there as Amba&s;&s;ador on the Part of
the <HI>Thebans, That they, the</HI> Spartans <HI>would do
well to &s;hew them the Example, by &s;etting free the
Country of</HI> Laconia; <HI>for that the Preten&s;ions of
the City of</HI> Thebes <HI>to the one, were as well founded,
as tho&s;e of the City of</HI> Sparta, <HI>to the other.</HI> He
urg'd farther, not only in Behalf of the <HI>Thebans,</HI>
but of <HI>Greece</HI> in general, <HI>That</HI> Sparta <HI>had aggran|diz'd
her&s;elf by War, at the Expence of her Neigh|bours;
<PB N="121" REF="147">
That Peace might be obtain'd, and &s;uch a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ne as might be &s;olid and la&s;ting; but that it could
not be otherwi&s;e &s;o, than by reducing all to an E|quality.</HI>
The&s;e Remon&s;trances, however ju&s;t they
were, yet &s;o incens'd <HI>Age&s;ilaus,</HI> that he &s;truck
the Name of the <HI>Thebans</HI> out of the Treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> declares War a|gain&s;t the Thebans.</NOTE> and
declar'd War again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The entering into a War in this manner, was

too ha&s;ty a Step; and when it was at la&s;t, and
with &s;ome Difficulty, decreed by the <HI>Ephori,</HI> it
was cen&s;ur'd, as an Act more of Pa&s;&s;ion than
Judgment, and as owing to the particular Pique
<HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> had to the <HI>Thebans,</HI> on who&s;e Account
he had been call'd out of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and thereupon
he laid hold of all Opportunities of being re|yeng'd

&s;ame time to conclude a Peace with the re&s;t of

either ob&s;erve, or break it, according as he &s;hould

which they could not for &s;hame give up; and
<HI>Epaminondas</HI> cho&s;e rather to gratify them in it

Wherefore he left them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their
dead King, and went on to their other Wing
which was commanded by <HI>Archidamus,</HI> and con|&s;i&s;ted
chiefly of the Allies, who had not willing|ly

and that they were to conquer without fight|ing,
or, as <HI>Diodorus</HI> expre&s;&s;es it,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> without Du&s;t.
But they were &s;o di&s;hearten'd at the Death
of <HI>Cleombrotus,</HI> and the Defeat of his Wing,
that they &s;oon betook them&s;elves to Flight, and
were follow'd by the re&s;t of the Army. <HI>Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|minondas</HI>
pur&s;ued them with great Slaughter,

The <HI>Thebans</HI> lo&s;t in the whole but three Hun|dred

<P><HI>Epaminondas</HI> had &s;ucceeded in every Part of
this Action, according to his Wi&s;h, and ac|cording
to the manner in which he had pro|jected
it. His Skill and Conduct in this Battle,
and in that which &s;ucceeded it at <HI>Manitinea,</HI> are
look'd upon as Ma&s;ter-pieces in their kind: And

exact Plans of them, as they are de&s;crib'd by
a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Chevalier de Folard.</NOTE> late Author in his Comments upon <HI>Poly|bius.</HI></P>
<P>This Battle was fought within twenty Days
after the Conclu&s;ion of the Peace. And as it
was the &s;harpe&s;t of any that had happen'd du|ring
the Wars of the <HI>Grecians</HI> among them|&s;elves,
&s;o it was more remarkable for the Num|ber
of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;lain; there having &s;eldom been above
four or five hundred kill'd on the Side of the
vanqui&s;h'd, even in the Height of the Rival&s;hip
between <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Sparta,</HI> when they fought
with the mo&s;t Rancour and Inveteracy. The
<HI>Thebans</HI> acquir'd more Glory by it, than any
of the Republicks had ever gain'd by any &s;ingle
Victory in tho&s;e Wars: And <HI>Epaminondas</HI> felt
&s;uch a &s;udden Exce&s;s of Joy upon it, that he
went out of his u&s;ual Character, and was hard|ly
able to contain him&s;elf. But the next Day,
upon cooler Thoughts, he re&s;um'd the Philo|&s;opher;
<PB N="128" REF="154">
and appear'd &s;o pen&s;ive and melancho|ly,
that his Friends were very inqui&s;itive to
know the Cau&s;e of it. He told them, <HI>He had
&s;uffered him&s;elf to be too much tran&s;ported upon
his Victory, and that he was now undergoing a
proper Cha&s;ti&s;ement for it.</HI> But his Command
of him&s;elf upon this Occa&s;ion, did not come up
to that of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> who&s;e Behaviour after
the Battle, was &s;o remarkably great, that I que|&s;tion
whether it can be parallel'd in the Hi&s;tory
of any Age, or Country.</P>
<P>If happen'd, that when the News of the Defeat
came to <HI>Sparta,</HI> they were celebrating a Publick
Fe&s;tival in the City, where there was a great Con|cour&s;e
of Strangers from &s;everal Parts of <HI>Greece.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Beha|viour of the <HI>Spar|tans</HI> after their De|feat.</NOTE>
The <HI>Ephori,</HI> who from the Accounts they had al|ready
received of the Battle, could not but be
&s;en&s;ible of the terrible Con&s;equences of it, yet gave
Orders, that the Solemnity of the Day &s;hould not
be interrupted; but privately &s;ending the Names
of the &s;lain to each Family, out of which they
were lo&s;t, they went on with the Sports and
Ceremonies, as if nothing had happen'd. The
next Morning, when they were more fully in|formed
of the Particulars, the Fathers and Re|lations
of the &s;lain came out rejoicing in the
Market-place, and &s;aluting each other with a
kind of Exultation: On the contrary, the Fa|thers
of tho&s;e who &s;urvived the Battle, conceal'd
them&s;elves in their Hou&s;es; and if any of them
were, upon any nece&s;&s;ary Occa&s;ion, obliged to
<PB N="129" REF="155">
go abroad, it was ea&s;ily di&s;cover'd by their
Looks, that they were a&s;ham'd to own their
Children. The Women carried it &s;till further,
the Mothers of the &s;lain openly rejoicing, chear|fully
making Vi&s;its to each other, and a&s;&s;emb|ling
in a triumphant manner in the Temples;
whil&s;t they who expected their Children home,
&s;at &s;ilent and dejected.</P>
<P>But the Generality of the People were a|waken'd
by this Misfortune, and con&s;ider'd it
as a Blow, that they &s;hould never be able to
recover. They began to de&s;pair, when they
found them&s;elves without Troops, de&s;erted by
their Allies, and, in a manner, at the Mercy
of the Conqueror; e&s;pecially when they were
further informed, that he de&s;ign'd to invade <HI>Pe|loponne&s;us.</HI>
This occa&s;ion'd a general Murmu|ring
and Repining: It brought to their Re|membrance
the former Predictions of the Oracle,
<HI>That they &s;hould &s;uffer under a lame King.</HI> They
con&s;ider'd further, that they had given the
Crown to this lame King, in prejudice to the
Right of <HI>Leotychidas</HI> his Nephew. But notwith|&s;tanding
the&s;e Reflections, and that he had un|doubtedly
been the &s;ole Author of their pre&s;ent
Calamity, he had &s;till &s;o much Credit with
them, that they renew'd the Confidence they
they had formerly placed in him, and &s;ubmitted
their Affairs entirely to his Determination, ei|ther
as to Peace or War.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="156">
One great Point under their immediate Con|&s;ideration,
was concerning tho&s;e who had fled
out of the Battle. They were by the Law in
that cafe, to be degraded from all Honours,
and render'd infamous, in&s;omuch that it was a
Di&s;grace to intermarry with them: They were
to appear publickly in mean and dirty Habits,
with patch'd and party-colour'd Garments, and
to go half-&s;hav'd; and whoever met them in
the Streets, might in&s;ult and beat them, and
they were not to make any Re&s;i&s;tance. This
was &s;o &s;evere a Law, and &s;uch Numbers had
incurr'd the Penalties of it, many of whom
were of great Families and Intere&s;t, that they
apprehended the Execution of it might occa&s;ion
&s;ome publick Commotions; be&s;ides that the&s;e
Citizens, &s;uch as they were, could very ill be
&s;pared at this time, when they wanted to re|cruit
the Army. Under this Difficulty, they
gave <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> a Power even over the Laws,
to di&s;pen&s;e with them, or to abrogate them,
or to enact &s;uch new ones, as the pre&s;ent Exi|gency
required. He would not aboli&s;h, or make
any Variation in the Law it&s;elf, but made a
publick Declarntion, That it &s;hould lie dormant
for that &s;ingle Day, but revive and be in full
Force again on the morrow; and by that Ex|pedient
he &s;aved the Citizens from Infamy.</P>

<P>THE Fugitives being thus re-in&s;tated in the

where he took a &s;mall Town belonging
to the <HI>Mantineans,</HI> and wa&s;ted the Territory,

barely nece&s;&s;ary to keep his Men in Action,
and to revive their Spirits, and at the &s;ame

not quite de&s;perate.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thebans</HI> in the mean time were endea|vouring
to improve their Victory; and &s;ent an
Herald crown'd with a Garland, to communi|cate
it in Form to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and to de|mand

it a fit Opportunity to make them&s;elves more ab|&s;olutely
Ma&s;ters at Sea; and if they could not
carry it further, &s;o as to obtain the Sovereign|ty

to &s;hare in it with <HI>Sparta,</HI> than to endanger
the letting the '<HI>Thebans</HI> into the whole: Upon
<PB N="132" REF="158">
which Con&s;iderations they di&s;mi&s;s'd the Herald
without giving him Audience.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Views,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olymp.</HI> 102. 3. The <HI>Athe|nians</HI> take advanta a of this O|verthrow of the <HI>Spartans.</HI></NOTE> they gave the <HI>Spartans</HI>
to under&s;tand, That, as they had lo&s;t their Power,
it was expected, they &s;hould lay a&s;ide their
Haughtine&s;s and Severity. At the &s;ame time
they took upon them&s;elves to maintain the Peace,
which, by the Deputies of the &s;everal Cities a&s;|&s;embled
at <HI>Athens,</HI> they cau&s;ed to be renew'd and
retified, in the Name of them, and their Con|federates.
The <HI>Thebans</HI> &s;tood out as before; and
the <HI>Eleans</HI> now followed their Example, object|ing
again&s;t the Freedom of &s;everal Towns, which
they pretended to be immediately under their
Juri&s;diction. And &s;everal other States afterwards
fell in with the <HI>Thebans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several States &s;ide with the <HI>Thebans.</HI></NOTE> &s;ome by Compul&s;ion,
and more out of Inclination and Policy, as they

<HI>A&s;ylum</HI> for tho&s;e who apprehended the Power
of their Neighbours, and more particularly of
the <HI>Spartans.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mantineans</HI> about this time took occa&s;i|on
to rebuild their City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Man|tineans</HI> re|build their City.</NOTE> which, with the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of the <HI>Eleans,</HI> and &s;ome Part of the
<HI>Arcadians,</HI> they perfected, and wall'd in, as
before. And, according to <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> the <HI>Ar|cadians</HI>
in general, by the Per&s;ua&s;ion of <HI>Epami|nondas,</HI>
out of &s;everal &s;mall Towns, built one
common City by the Name of <HI>Megalopolis;</HI>
tho' <HI>Diodorus</HI> places it two years lower, upon
<PB N="133" REF="159">
their great Overthrow by the <HI>Spartans.</HI> Thus
far the <HI>Arcadians</HI> had made a right and rea&s;ona|ble
u&s;e of <HI>Sparta</HI>'s being humbled: But they,
and &s;ome other States, when they found them|&s;elves
re&s;tored, according to the Treaty, to
the free Enjoyment of their own Laws, and
Forms of Government, grew wanton and ca|pricious,
and fell into &s;uch Di&s;&s;en&s;ions among
them&s;elves, as prov'd of wor&s;e Con&s;equence to
them, than the Dominion of <HI>Sparta.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Tegeans,</HI> who had
form'd a Scheme of uniting them&s;elves, with
all the re&s;t of the <HI>Arcadians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commoti|ons in <HI>Ar|cadia.</HI></NOTE> into one Body
of a Common-wealth, with a General Council,
con&s;i&s;ting of ten Thou&s;and; in whom there
was to be lodg'd an ab&s;olute Power, to deter|mine
all Matters relating to Peace and War.
But this Project occa&s;ion'd &s;uch Factions and
Tumults among them, that great Numbers
were kill'd, and above fourteen Hundred ba|ni&s;h'd;
and it ended in bringing the <HI>Spartans</HI>
again upon them, under the old Pretence of
re&s;toring Exiles, and in making their Country
a Seat of War.</P>
<P><HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> immediately took occa&s;ion from the&s;e
inte&s;tine Divi&s;ions, to &s;end a Body of fifteen
Hundred Men among them under the Com|mand
of <HI>Polytropus.</HI> He po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was another City of this Name in Boeotia.</NOTE> <HI>Orchomenus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Battle at Orcho|menus.</NOTE> which was well affected to <HI>Sparta,</HI>
and garri&s;on'd it. <HI>Lycomedes</HI> the <HI>Arcadian</HI> Ge|neral
<PB N="134" REF="160">
being about three to one &s;tronger, march'd
up to him, and offer'd him Battle under the
Walls. <HI>Polytropus</HI> accepted it, and was kill'd,
with two hundred of his Men; and the re&s;t
were forc'd back into the City. However <HI>Ly|comedes,</HI>
not doubting but the <HI>Spartans</HI> would
come with a greater FoRce to revenge them|&s;elves,
did not think it advi&s;eable to pur&s;ue
his Victory without &s;ome further A&s;&s;i&s;tance.
Accordingly he applied to the <HI>Athenians;</HI> but
they refus'd to join with him, concluding, as
they had done before, with regard to the <HI>The|bans,</HI>
that <HI>Sparta</HI> was low enough already, and
that it would be wrong Policy in them at this
time to &s;upport any other State again&s;t her.
Hereupon the <HI>Arcadians</HI> had recour&s;e to the
<HI>Thebans,</HI> who receiv'd them with open Arms;
and this was a great Addition to the Confe|deracy,
that was forming again&s;t <HI>Sparta.</HI></P>
<P>About the Time of the civil Di&s;cord among
the <HI>Arcadians</HI> concerning their new Form of
Government, there happen'd a more grievous
In&s;tance of the &s;ame kind at <HI>Argos;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sedition at <HI>Argos.</HI></NOTE> where the
Government being in the People, the Orators,
or Demagogues, (as they were more properly
call'd) ftirt'd them up again&s;t the Nobility,
who, to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t the In&s;ults
and Outrages to which they were expos'd, en|ter'd
into Con&s;piracy to de&s;troy the <HI>Democra|cy.</HI>
Which being &s;u&s;pected by the Commons,
they put &s;everal to the Rack, and extorted
<PB N="135" REF="161">
from them a Confe&s;&s;ion of the whole De&s;ign.
Whereupon they murther'd Thirty of tho&s;e
who were principally concern'd, without any
Form of Trial: And many fal&s;e Accu&s;ations
again&s;t others, were dre&s;s'd up and aggravated
by the&s;e Orators; in&s;omuch that there were
above &s;ixteen hundred of the greate&s;t and rich|e&s;t
Men of the City executed, and their E&s;tates
confi&s;cated. At length the Orators, whether
they were &s;truck with Remor&s;e for the Cruel|ties
they had ocea&s;ion'd, or that they were a|fraid
of being at la&s;t involv'd in the general
Ruin, began to &s;lacken in their Pro&s;ecutions;
and the People from thence concluding, that
they had de&s;erted their Cau&s;e, murther'd &s;uch of
them as they could find remaining in the City.
This was the greate&s;t Ma&s;&s;acre that had hap|pen'd
in any City of <HI>Greece;</HI> and it was di|&s;tingui&s;hed
by the Name of <HI>The Seytali&s;m,</HI> from
the manner in which it was executed, by the
knocking on the Head with Clubs. And this
Sedition was a very unlucky Conjuncture for
that City, which was &s;o rich and powerful,
that &s;he was in a Condition to di&s;pute the
Sovereignty of <HI>Greece.</HI> This Opinion was con|firm'd
by <HI>Ja&s;on,</HI> who putting in his Claim
to it in behalf of the <HI>The&s;&s;alians,</HI> made u&s;e
of it as an Argument to them, that the <HI>Ar|gives</HI>
were too much weaken'd with their in|te&s;tine
Broils, to appear as Competitors.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="162">

he had gain'd many of the neighbouring Coun|tries

him for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, when they found them|&s;elves
di&s;appointed of it at <HI>Athens.</HI> He appear'd
ready to join them with a good Body of Troops;
but when it came to the Point, he diverted them
from pur&s;uing their Victory, advi&s;ing them to
u&s;e it with Moderation, and not to make the
<HI>Spartans</HI> de&s;perate. The <HI>Spartans,</HI> on the other
hand, he per&s;uaded to lie by a little, till they
had recover'd Breath, and could fight upon more
advantageous Temrs: So that he acted rather as
a Mediator, than an Ally; and there is Mention
made of a Truce concluded between them by
his Means; but the Account of it is &s;o differently
related, that it does not appear, whether it were
before, or after the Battle of <HI>Leuctra. Ja&s;on's</HI>
Bu&s;ine&s;s was to manage &s;o between tho&s;e States,
that neither of them might grow too powerful,
and that he might make his Advantage of it in
bringing about his own De&s;igns; which, by his
Mony, Art and Eloquence, he had in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
effected. But notwith&s;tanding that he was
eager in the Pur&s;uit of his Ambition, he endea|vour'd
to &s;ave Appearances, and to pre&s;erve a
good Character; &s;o that when he had injur'd or
mole&s;ted any of his Neighbours, he would &s;ay,

to fall upon him, cut off a good Num|ber
of his Men. However he made good his
Pa&s;&s;age, and march'd up to the Suburbs of the
City; where the Inhabitants were, with great
Difficulty, re&s;train'd from ru&s;hing out in a con|fus'd
and de&s;perate manner upon the Enemy.
But <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> upon this Occa&s;ion &s;hew'd more
Temper than ordinary; he found it nece&s;&s;ary to
lay a&s;ide his Pride and Ob&s;tinacy, and to play a
&s;aving Game. He endeavour'd to quiet the
Minds of the People, &s;o as to keep them within
their Bounds, and made the be&s;t Di&s;po&s;ition he
could of them, for the Defence of the City.
It was thought proper in this Extrernity to pro|claim,
That as many of the <HI>Helots,</HI> as would en|lift,
and form them&s;elves into Companies, &s;hould
receive their Freedom; and a thou&s;and of them
accepted the Offer; <HI>Xenophon</HI> &s;ays, &s;ix thou&s;and;
which is not very improbable from the Circum|&s;tance
he adds, that when they were arm'd in a
Body, they made &s;o formidable an Appearance,
that the <HI>Spartans</HI> them&s;elves dur&s;t not tru&s;t them,
without placing a good Number of Mercenaries
and other Troops, as a Guard upon them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thebans</HI> being thus far advanc'd, made a
&s;ort of Encampment near the City, and endea|vour'd
to draw the <HI>Spartans</HI> out of it, in order to a

con&s;iderable Lo&s;s, and di&s;courag'd from making
a &s;econd Attempt. They contented them&s;elves
with encamping again without the City, where
they bid Defiance to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> and challeng'd
them to come out, and give them Battle; to
which they return'd a very cool An&s;wer, <HI>That

Occa&s;ion.</HI> Then they reproach'd <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> by
Name, as the Incendiary of the War, and the
Author of all the Mi&s;chief done to his Country.
But he re&s;olv'd not to be provok'd; he over|look'd
all the&s;e per&s;onal In&s;ults and Reflections,
as the Effects of Rage and Di&s;appointment, and
would not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be diverted from the
only Point he had then in view, which was the
Security of the City; and the Pre&s;ervation of it
at this Time, was no le&s;s owing to this Com|mand
of him&s;elf, than to his good Conduct in
other Re&s;pects.</P>

ill-natur'd, perver&s;e and envious. he was

the affair of the <HI>Cadmea;</HI> and not thinking

<PB N="144" REF="170">
Enterprize, made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s, upon all Occa|&s;ions,
to accu&s;e and calumniate his Superiors.
Even after the Trial, he prevail'd &s;o far, as to
get <HI>Epaminondas</HI> excluded for a Year from the
Government of <HI>Boeotia:</HI> But <HI>Pelopidas</HI> being more
a Favourite with the People, he went another
way to work, and endeavour'd to &s;upplant him,
by &s;etting up <HI>Charon</HI> again&s;t him; which he
contriv'd in the following manner. There was a
famous Painter of <HI>Cyzicus</HI> employ'd at <HI>Thebes</HI> in
drawing a Battle, but was forc'd away by the
Revolt there, before he had put the la&s;t Hand
to it. However the Picture remaining in the
City, <HI>Meneclides</HI> propos'd the hanging it up in
&s;ome publick Place, with an In&s;cription to per|petuate
the Memory of a Victory obtain'd by
<HI>Charon</HI> at <HI>Plataea,</HI> tho' it was in reality no
more than a Skirmi&s;h, wherein forty <HI>Spartan;</HI>
were kill'd. This Action happen'd a little be|fore
the Battle of <HI>Leuctra;</HI> and the magnifying
it in this manner, was plainly with a De&s;ign to
eclip&s;e the Glory of that Day, and to throw a Slurupon 
the two Generals who commanded. <HI>Pele|pidas</HI>
therefore oppos'd the Motion; which yet
he did with great Art and Decency with regard
to <HI>Charon,</HI> to whom he gave all due Prai&s;e; but
at the &s;ame time he expos'd the Ab&s;urdity of the
Propo&s;al, and the Malice and Impertinence of
the Author of it; which the People being &s;en|&s;ible
of, laid &s;o heavy a Fine upon him, that
<PB N="145" REF="171">
he was not able to pay it; and from thence|forward
he grew a common Di&s;turber of the
Government.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> they had unex|pectedly
got rid of a very formidable Enemy:
But the Terror and Confu&s;ion they had been in,
the Sen&s;e of the Lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tain'd, and
their Apprehen&s;ions of what further might hap|pen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabals and Con|&s;piracies in Sparta.</NOTE> had created a great deal of ill Blood a|mong
them, and rai&s;ed &s;uch a Spirit of mur|muring,
and caballing again&s;t the Government,
that <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> found it almo&s;t as difficult a Task
to manage the People in the City, as to keep
the Enemy out of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Means by which <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> &s;uppre&s;s'd them.</NOTE> There was an In&s;tance
of this kind, wherein he &s;hew'd extraordinary
Addre&s;s, and Pre&s;ence of Mind. Two hundred
Malecontents had got into a &s;trong Part of the
Town, call'd <HI>I&s;&s;orion,</HI> where they had &s;eized
the Temple of <HI>Diana. Age&s;ilaus</HI> would not
employ Force again&s;t them, not knowing
how deep the Plot might be laid, and how
far it might &s;pread; but went muffled up
in his Cloak, with only one Servant; and be|ing
come near the Rebels, call'd out, and told
them, <HI>You have mi&s;taken my Orders; my Direc|tions
were not that you &s;hould all go in a Body
to that Station, but &s;ome of you &s;hould plant
your&s;elves there, and others there;</HI> at the &s;ame
time pointing out to them different Parts of the
City. They went off accordingly, without the
lea&s;t Su&s;picion, to the Places which he mark'd
<PB N="146" REF="172">
out to them; and immediately, upon their be|ing
thus di&s;pers'd, he order'd &s;ome of the
Troops to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of that Po&s;t, and
cau&s;ed about fifteen of the Con&s;pirators to be
apprehended; and they were put to death the
Night following. This Con&s;piracy was fol|low'd
by another of more dangerous Con&s;e|quence,
wherein a great Number of the Citi|zens
were engaged, and had private Con&s;ulta|tions
every Night, how to introduce a Change
in the Government. They were &s;o &s;trong a
Party, that it was neither &s;afe to pro&s;ecute them
publickly according to Law, nor to let them
go on, and connive at them. Wherefore <HI>Age|&s;ilaus</HI>
took another cour&s;e, and, with the Con|&s;ent
of the <HI>Ephori,</HI> put them to death private|ly
without Proce&s;s; which had never before been
practi&s;ed in <HI>Sparta.</HI> But the pre&s;ent Exigency
of Affairs &s;eem'd to make it nece&s;&s;ary; for the&s;e
Seditions happen'd about the Time of the <HI>The|ban</HI>
Expedition. And to add to the Con&s;ter|nation
the City was then under, many of the
<HI>Helots</HI> and Mercenaries at the &s;ame time de&s;erted
to the Enemy.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Spartans</HI> having got over the&s;e do|me&s;tick
Difficulties, and repuls'd the <HI>Thebans,</HI>
began now to look abroad, and provide for
their future Security. They had got together
a good Body of Auxiliaries from <HI>Corinth,</HI> and
other Parts of <HI>Peloponne&s;us:</HI> But their chief De|pendence
was on the <HI>Athenians,</HI> to whom they
<PB N="147" REF="173">
had formally given up the Command at Sea,
in order to fix them in their Intere&s;t; but they
were not &s;o &s;anguine in it, as was expected;
&s;o that what they did, was rather to keep the
<HI>Thebans</HI> under,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Com|mand di|vided e|qually be|tween <HI>A|thens</HI> and <HI>Sparta.</HI></NOTE> than to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Spartans.</HI> They
now in&s;i&s;ted on being upon the &s;ame Foot|ing

they call'd, Treating upon equal Terms: And
&s;ince nothing le&s;s would content them, it was ac|cordingly
agreed, that each State &s;hould com|mand
five Days alternately.</P>
<P>This Agreement was no &s;ooner made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Arca|dians</HI> re|new the War.</NOTE> but the
<HI>Arcadians</HI> renew'd the War. They took <HI>Pallene</HI>
in <HI>Laconia</HI> by Storm, where they put above three
hundred <HI>Spartans</HI> in Garri&s;on to the Sword,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olymp.</HI> 103. 1.</NOTE> and
ravag'd the Country. After which they were
join'd by the <HI>Argives</HI> and <HI>Eleans;</HI> and the <HI>The|bans</HI>
&s;ent <HI>Epaminodas</HI> again to them, with &s;even
thou&s;and Foot, and five hundred Hor&s;e. The
<HI>Athenians</HI> being now in earne&s;t, &s;ent <HI>Chabrias</HI> to
oppo&s;e his Pa&s;&s;age. He join'd the <HI>Spartans,</HI>
with their Allies, at <HI>Corinth,</HI> where they made
up an Army of twenty thou&s;and Men; to which
there was afterwards an Addition of two thou|&s;and
from <HI>Sicily,</HI> who did good Service. <HI>Epa|minondas</HI>
came up to force his Pa&s;&s;age, as he had
done before, into <HI>Peloponne&s;us;</HI> but finding it
&s;hut up with a Wall, and a deep Interechment
a-cro&s;s the <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> as at the Time of the Inva|&s;ion

Enemy out into the Field, which they declin'd,
<PB N="148" REF="174">
altho' they were near three times his number.
Whereupon he &s;urvey'd the Works, and finding
one Part, where the <HI>Spartans</HI> were po&s;ted, weaker
than the re&s;t, he cho&s;e to make his main At|tack
there;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Epami|nondas</HI> a|gain in|vades <HI>Pe|loponne&s;us</HI></NOTE> which he did with &s;uch Re&s;olution
and Bravery, that, after a very hot Di&s;pute on

from <HI>Corinth,</HI> but quitted <HI>Peloponne&s;us:</HI>
And the Honour of this Defence was almo&s;t en|tirely
owing to <HI>Chabrias.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Epaminodas,</HI> by one Part of his Conduct in
this Expedition, incurr'd the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the
State. For notwith&s;tanding his Bravery in forcing
the Pa&s;s, that was defended by the <HI>Spartans,</HI> he
was &s;u&s;pected of Partiality towards them, for not
having pur&s;u'd and &s;laughter'd them, when they
were judg'd to be in his Power. His Enemies
aggravating the Matter, and making it a Charge
of Treachery, got him turn'd out of the Go|vernment
of <HI>Boeotia,</HI> and reduc'd to the Condi|tion
of a private Man. This Accu&s;ation was not
<PB N="149" REF="175">
thought to be well founded enough for &s;o &s;evere
a Cen&s;ure: However an Occa&s;ion offer'd &s;oon
after, wherein his Service was &s;o &s;ea&s;onable, and
&s;o important, that he ea&s;ily wip'd off the A&s;per|&s;ion.</P>
<P>It
does not appear, what Effect the dividing
the Command between <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Sparta</HI> had
upon this Inva&s;ion; however it produc'd one
good Con&s;equence, as it &s;erv'd to weaken the
Confederacy again&s;t them. For it was now made
u&s;e of as a Precedent by the <HI>Arcadians,</HI> who were
grown &s;o elated with their Succe&s;&s;es, and put &s;uch
a Value upon their Services again&s;t <HI>Sparta,</HI> that
they di&s;dain'd to act any longer in Subordination
to the <HI>Thebans.</HI> This Spirit was rais'd in them
by <HI>Lycomedes</HI> of <HI>Mantinea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Arca|dians</HI> &s;pi|rited up by <HI>Lycome|des.</HI></NOTE> who had been their
General in mo&s;t of their late Expeditions. He
was of great Birth and Fortune, and being am|bitious
withal, repre&s;ented to them, That the
whole Country of <HI>Peloponne&s;us</HI> belong'd properly
to them, as the fir&s;t ancient Inhabitants; That
they were the mo&s;t numerous of any People in
<HI>Greece,</HI> and &s;o &s;tout and powerful, that they had
always been con&s;ider'd in the fir&s;t Rank of Auxi|liaries;
in&s;omuch that the <HI>Spartans</HI> had never
done any thing again&s;t <HI>Athens</HI> without them, nor
had the <HI>Thebans</HI> now appear'd again&s;t <HI>Sparta,</HI> if
they had not &s;upported them: That as they had
formerly advanc'd the Affairs of the <HI>Spartans,</HI>
they were now doing the &s;ame for the <HI>Thebans;</HI>
and that in &s;hort, if they did not in&s;i&s;t upon

might in the End find them <HI>Spartans</HI> too. He
had &s;o inflam'd them with the&s;e Remon&s;trances,
and gain'd &s;uch an entire Credit with them, that
they ea&s;ily agreed to every thing he propos'd;
and there was nothing &s;o difficult that they were
not ready to undertake. This created a great
Coldne&s;s and Jealou&s;y on the Part of the <HI>Thebans:</HI>
And the <HI>Eleans</HI> at the &s;ame time were inclin'd
to break with the <HI>Arcadians,</HI> for refu&s;ing to de|liver

<HI>Alexander</HI> at fir&s;t permitted every Body to &s;ee

Spectacle, to break his Spirit, and humble him.
But it had a different Effect: He &s;ent to tell
him in Defiance, <HI>That it was ab&s;urd in him, daily
to terment and put to Death &s;o many innocent

pur&s;uing them, great Numbers of their Men

that the re&s;t of them were not totally defeated.
He was at this time in Di&s;grace with the Govern|ment,
the Rea&s;on whereof has before been re|lated;
and therefore he had no Command in this
Expedition, but &s;erv'd as a common Soldier.
However when the Troops found them&s;elves un|der
the&s;e Difficulties, which they attributed to
the Incapacity of their Officers, they oblig'd
him to take upon him the Command. He took
the Hor&s;e, and light-arm'd Foot, and po&s;ting

Enemy by turns, till he made good the Retreat.

<HI>Alexander</HI> was very much terrified at his

they had now a good Pretence for it; for the

to a&s;&s;i&s;t there likewi&s;e, in order to &s;upport

and <HI>Pelopidas</HI> was named on behalf of the <HI>The|bans;</HI>
which the <HI>Athenians</HI> being inform'd of,
<PB N="157" REF="183">
appointed Two on their part al&s;o. But this
was a Proof how much they were degenerated
from the Virtue of their Ance&s;tors: For what|ever
mean Applications had before been made
to the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> by particular Per&s;ons or States,
there had been no In&s;tance of a of a Congre&s;s of
this kind, where, by a general Con&s;ent, all the

a&s;&s;embled in Form, to di&s;cu&s;s and
&s;ettle their Demands on each other, at the
Court of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> But this was the Ca&s;e at
pre&s;ent; and the <HI>Spartans</HI> had chiefly contribu|ted
to it by the Peace of <HI>Antalcidas,</HI> which
had prepared the <HI>Grecians</HI> in general to receive
the Yoke, and to govern them&s;elves according
to the Edicts of that King, who&s;e Predece&s;&s;ors
had been &s;o &s;hamefully bafled in their At|tempts

by his Addre&s;s, and the Fame of his Exploits,
that he was particularly di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the
re&s;t of them, and the King received him with
mo&s;t extraordinary Marks of Honour and E|&s;teem.
He repre&s;ented to him at his Audience,
That the <HI>Thebans</HI> had con&s;tantly, from the Bat|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e
of <HI>Plataea</HI> to this pre&s;ent time, adhered to

broke with them, purely becau&s;e they refu&s;ed
to join with them again&s;t him. From thence
he took occa&s;ion to mention their succe&s;s at
<HI>Leuctra,</HI> with their invading <HI>Laconia;</HI> and in|timated,
that the late Overthrow of the <HI>Ar|cadians</HI>
and <HI>Argives</HI> was owing to their not
having been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by them. The King was
&s;o well plea&s;ed with his Per&s;on and Di&s;cour&s;e,
and was &s;o well affected to the <HI>Thebans,</HI> as the
People on whom he could be&s;t depend, that
he readily granted his Demands: The Sub|&s;tance
whereof was, <HI>That the Liberty formerly
granted to all the Towns, &s;hould be confirmed;
That</HI> Me&s;&s;ene <HI>in particular &s;hould remain free
from the Juri&s;diction of the</HI> Spartans; <HI>That the</HI>
Athenians <HI>&s;hould lay up their Fleet;</HI> and <HI>that
the</HI> Thebans <HI>&s;hould be look'd upon as the ancient
heredilary Friends and Allies of</HI> Per&s;ia.</P>
<P><HI>Pelopidas</HI> gain'd great Credit by this Nego|tiation:
And the <HI>Thebans</HI> upon his return ex|pecting
to receive the Benefit of it, caus'd the
Deputies of all the Towns to be a&s;&s;embled at
<HI>Thebes,</HI> in order to their ratifying the Treaty.
But when the Oath for confirming it was ten|der'd
to them, they &s;aid, <HI>They came to hear
the Articles read, not to &s;wear to them; which
they could not do without con&s;ulting their Prin|cipals.</HI>
And <HI>Lycomedes</HI> objected, in behalf of
the <HI>Arcadians,</HI> to the Place of their Meeting,
which, he &s;aid, ought to be where the Seat
of the War was. This Method not taking
<PB N="159" REF="185">
effect, the Cities were applied to &s;epartely,
in hopes by that means to awe them into a
Compliance. But the <HI>Corinthians</HI> &s;aid plainly,
<HI>They did not &s;ee any Occa&s;ion there was for the

nothing further was done in it; &s;o that the
<HI>Thebans</HI> were all at once di&s;appointed in their
Views; and <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> left them as he found
them, without engaging him&s;elf any further in
their behalf; which indeed he could not do at
this time, without arming the re&s;t of <HI>Greece</HI>
again&s;t him. For his Partiality to the <HI>Thebans,</HI>
was now no le&s;s vi&s;ible, than the De&s;igns of
the <HI>Thebans</HI> them&s;elves, who had rais'd &s;o much
Jealou&s;y by what they had already done, that
there was a general Di&s;po&s;ition to unite again&s;t
them, and to make it a <HI>Common Cau&s;e.</HI> The
<HI>Athenians</HI> were particularly di&s;gu&s;ted by that
Article of the Treaty, which was to re&s;train
their Power at Sea; and they &s;hew'd their
Re&s;entment by putting to death <HI>Timagoras</HI>

a Siege, and made a vigorous Defence, far
beyond what could have been expected from
a &s;mall City, &s;urrounded with &s;o powerful Ene|mies.
The chief Quarrel again&s;t them was
their &s;teady Adherence to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> for
who&s;e Sakes they had often been reduced to
the greate&s;t Streights and Nece&s;&s;ities, and yet
never could be prevail'd upon, from their fir&s;t

<P>The <HI>Athenians,</HI> upon this new Acce&s;&s;ion, act|ed
a treacherous Part again&s;t <HI>Corinth,</HI> which
they were endeavouring to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of,

There is a Di&s;agreement among the Hi&s;tori|ans

<P>This la&s;t Treaty had no more than the Name
and Appearance of a Peace; which, according to
the pre&s;ent Situation of Affairs, was not like|ly
to be &s;incere, or of any long Continuance.
The growing Power of <HI>Thebes</HI> could not but
nece&s;&s;arily keep up the other Great States in

The Flame was fir&s;t kindled between the <HI>Ar|cadians</HI>

their Right to <HI>Triphylia,</HI> which belong'd pro|perly
to the latter; and both Sides, according

of the <HI>Eleans</HI> upon this Occa&s;ion was the more
remarkable, becau&s;e they had a very low Re|putation

<P>Whil&s;t he was negotiating the&s;e Matters

<P>The <HI>The&s;&s;alians</HI> &s;till groaning under the Ty|ranny

took up Arms again&s;t him; but being wor&s;ted

But ju&s;t as he was ready to march, there
happen'd a great Eclip&s;e of the Sun, from
which the People, according to the Ignorance
and Super&s;tition of the Times, apprehended
&s;uch &s;trange Effects, that <HI>Pelopidas</HI> thought it
not advi&s;eable to proceed with &s;o great a Num|ber
of his Countrymen, again&s;t the general
<PB N="167" REF="193">
Opinion, that the Expedition would prove fa|tal.
As to him&s;elf, he was not at all moved
at this <HI>Phaenomenon,</HI> altho' he was &s;uppo&s;ed to
be principally affected by it: For the <HI>Augurs</HI>
had made it portend his Death, con&s;idering
him as the <HI>Sun</HI> of <HI>Thebes,</HI> that was to be eclip|&s;ed.
However he re&s;olv'd to go on, and march'd
out with only three hundred Hor&s;emen, who
attended him as Voluntiers; and having join'd
the <HI>The&s;&s;alians,</HI> he encamp'd in the Face of the
Enemy, who was far &s;uperior to him in Num|bers,
having an Army of above twenty thou|&s;and
Men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle at <HI>Cynos|cephalae.</HI></NOTE> Near a Place call'd <HI>Cynos-cephalae,</HI>
there were two Hills oppo&s;ite to each other
in the mid&s;t of the Plain; and both Sides
endeavour'd to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them with their
Foot. <HI>Pelopidas</HI> at the &s;ame time order'd his
Cavalry to charge that of the Enemy, which
he &s;oon routed, and pur&s;ued over the Plain.
But <HI>Alexander</HI> having gain'd the Hills, and do|ing
great Execution upon the <HI>The&s;&s;alians,</HI> who
attempted to force tho&s;e A&s;cents, <HI>Pelopidas</HI> was
obliged to give over his Pur&s;uit, and march
up to their Relief; which &s;o animated them,
that, after two or three Charges, the Enemy
began to fall into Di&s;order, and give way;
which <HI>Pelopidas</HI> perceiving, ca&s;t his Eyes about
in &s;earch of <HI>Alexander,</HI> and having at length
di&s;cover'd him in the right Wing, rallying and
encouraging his Men, he was &s;o inflamed at
the Sight, that he advanced before his Soldiers,
<PB N="168" REF="194">
crying out, and challenging the Tyrant, who
retreated, and &s;helter'd him&s;elf in the Ranks.
<HI>Pelopidas</HI> there upon grew de&s;perate, and charg'd
the Enemy a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">h, great Numbers whereof, as
they advanc'd forwards, he cut down with his

However, to revenge his Death, they attack'd
the Enemy &s;o vigorou&s;ly, both with their
Hor&s;e and Foot, that they intirely routed them,
and kill'd above three thou&s;and in the Pur&s;uit:
And yet did they not look upon it as a Vi|ctory,
or think that any Succe&s;s could compen&s;ate
the Lo&s;s of their General. The <HI>Thebans,</HI> who
were then pre&s;ent, lamented over him in the
tendere&s;t and mo&s;t affectionate manner, calling
him <HI>Their Father, Saviour,</HI> and <HI>In&s;tructor in
every thing that was great and excellent.</HI> The
<HI>The&s;&s;alians,</HI> and other Allies not only &s;ympa|thiz'd,
but vy'd with them in expre&s;&s;ing their
Concern, and doing Honour to his Memory:
And the whole Army was &s;o affected, that
they neither put off their Armour, nor un|bridled
their Hor&s;es, nor even dre&s;s'd their
Wounds; but ran to him, and heap'd up the
Spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ls of the Enemy about his dead Body;
they cut off their Hor&s;es Manes, and their
<PB N="169" REF="195">
own Hair; and &s;uch as retired to their Tents,
neither kindled a Fire, nor took any kind of
Refre&s;hment. In all the Cities through which
the Body pa&s;s'd, it was attended by the Ma|gi&s;trates,
with the Prie&s;ts and Inhabitants, car|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ying
Trophies, Crowns and golden Armour.
After which the <HI>The&s;&s;alians</HI> begg'd it as a &s;in|gular
Favour of the <HI>Thebans,</HI> that they might
bury him, and, in the mo&s;t pathetick Terms, urg'd
it as a &s;ort of Right due to them, as the greate&s;t
Sufferers. <HI>You indeed,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>have lo&s;t a
great General; and in that we &s;hare in common
with you: But we have likewi&s;e lo&s;t in him all
the Hopes of recovering our Liberty; and under
this heavy Misfortune, our paying the la&s;t Ho|nours
to him, may be &s;ome &s;mall Alleviation of
our Sorrow.</HI> The <HI>Thebans</HI> granted their Re|que&s;t,
and they buried him with great Pomp
and Splendor. His Death, as to the Manner
of it, was rather to be pitied than commend|ed:
For he certainly expos'd him&s;elf more than
he ought to have done. But be&s;ides the natu|ral
Heat of his Temper, which was not ea&s;ily
to be re&s;train'd, he was animated with a more
than ordinary Zeal in the Cau&s;e of Liber|ty,
e&s;pecially at this Juncture, when i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
was, in a manner, de&s;erted by the other
Great States. For the <HI>Spartans,</HI> in&s;tead of
exerting them&s;elves, as formerly, in behalf of

<HI>Alexander,</HI> and, in Honour to him, had erected

the faire&s;t Occa&s;ion of advancing his own
and his Country's Honour, and of making it

he was fired with Re&s;entment again&s;t the Per|&s;on

the Tyranny.</P>
<P>He was of one of the be&s;t Families in <HI>Thebes,</HI>
and came early to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large For|tune,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha|racter.</NOTE> which he employ'd chiefly in the Relief o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
&s;uch as wanted, and de&s;erved his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. Among
the re&s;t, he pitch'd upon <HI>Epaminondas</HI> as:
proper Object of his Bounty, but could neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
prevail with him to accept a Pre&s;ent from him
Which had &s;uch an Effect upon him, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

open unaffected Simplicity, which he ever after
wards maintain'd in the highe&s;t Po&s;ts of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Government. But notwith&s;tanding this Regula|rity,
<PB N="171" REF="197">
and Appearance of Oeconomy, his con&s;tant
Attention to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Publick made
him neglect his private Affairs, and very much
impair'd his E&s;tate; in&s;omuch that having a
great Number of Children to provide for, his
Friends took Occa&s;ion one Day to tell him, <HI>That
Mony was a very nece&s;&s;ary thing. It is &s;o indeed,</HI>
&s;aid he; <HI>but it is for that Man yonder,</HI> pointing
to one <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> who was lame and blind.
There was a great Conformity of Manners be|tween
him and <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> except that he de|lighted
mo&s;t in the Exerci&s;es of the Body, and
the other in tho&s;e of the Mind. But they had
the &s;ame general Di&s;po&s;ition to Virtue, and the
Love of their Country; and this begat the &s;trict|e&s;t
Friend&s;hip between them. <HI>Plutarch</HI> dates
the Beginning of it from the Siege of <HI>Mantinea,</HI>
&s;oon after the <HI>Peace of Antalcidas.</HI> The <HI>Thebans</HI>
acting then in Alliance with <HI>Sparta, Epaminondas</HI>
and <HI>Pelopidas</HI> were engag'd together, and their
Wing giving way, they kept their Ground, and
&s;tood &s;ingly in each others Defence, till <HI>Pelopidas</HI>
being very much wounded, fell among the Slain.
<HI>Epaminondas</HI> concluded him dead, yet would not
leave his Body in the Power of the Enemy, but,
tho' he was wounded him&s;elf likewi&s;e, maintain'd
the Conflict, till at length <HI>Age&s;ipolis</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI>
King came up from the other Wing of the
Army, and re&s;cu'd them both, when to all Ap|pearance
they were lo&s;t. This was an Ac|tion
that mu&s;t, in all Probability, have happen'd
<PB N="172" REF="198">
before the Town was be&s;ieg'd; and there is room
to collect from <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> that it did &s;o: But it
is not generally taken notice of, nor any where
particularly de&s;crib'd; neither does it el&s;ewhere
appear, that either of the&s;e two Generals had
di&s;tingui&s;h'd them&s;elves &s;o early in any En|gagement.
However this Circum&s;tance of their
Lives, in the manner it is atte&s;ted, may
have its Weight, and it is too remarkable a
one to be omitted. But however their Friend|&s;hip
began, it was very &s;incere and la&s;ting; and
the Succe&s;s of their Atchievements was almo&s;t in|tirely
owing to that perfect Union and good
Corre&s;pondence, that was always between them,
without any Jealou&s;y of Command abroad, or
Rival&s;hip in the Admini&s;tration at home. This
good Agreement between them, has been ta|ken
notice of, in oppo&s;ition to that Spirit of Di&s;|&s;en&s;ion,
Envy and Rancour, which formerly
reign'd in <HI>Athens</HI> between <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> and <HI>The|mi&s;tocles,
Cimon</HI> and <HI>Pericles, Nicias</HI> and <HI>Alcibi|ades,</HI>
who, great as they were in other re&s;pects,
were always endeavouring to &s;upplant and ruin
one another; and their per&s;onal Enmity was
&s;aid to exceed that which they bore to the
Enemies of their Country. But yet it has been
&s;hewn, that &s;ome of them knew how to &s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">le
their Jealou&s;ies upon Occa&s;ion, and to curb and
moderate their Re&s;entment, when the Affairs
of the Publick requir'd it. But there was no
need of any Management of this kind, between
<PB N="173" REF="199">
the two Great Men we are now &s;peaking of.
They had no private Views of their own;
they were above all Con&s;iderations of Mony;
and they had no Ambitions but for the Pub|lick;
&s;o that provided That were well &s;erved,
their Intention was an&s;wer'd; and each of them
look'd upon the others Succe&s;s in it, as his own.
As to what relates further to <HI>Pelopidas</HI> &s;ingly,
he was very &s;trong and active, and of inde&s;a|tigable
Indu&s;try; he was bold and enterpri&s;ing,
and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful withal, that he never lo&s;t one
Battle. He had &s;o throughly e&s;tabli&s;hed him|&s;elf
in the Favour and Affections of the Peo|ple,
that he was cho&s;e thirteen times Governor
of <HI>Boeotia,</HI> or (as <HI>Diodorus</HI> &s;ays) without Inter|uption,
from the Time of the recovering the
<HI>Cadm&ecirc;a.</HI> Upon the whole, he was at lea&s;t the
&s;econd Man of <HI>Thebes,</HI> and in &s;ome re&s;pects
may be con&s;ider'd as the Fir&s;t, particularly
with regard to the Affair of the <HI>Cadm&ecirc;a,</HI> which
was certainly the Foundation of the <HI>Theban</HI>
Greatne&s;s. He would indeed have per&s;uaded
<HI>Epaminondas</HI> to bear a part with him in that
Undertaking; but he declin'd it, as an Action
of too much Blood and Outrage. He told
him, <HI>That if the re&s;t who were concern'd in
it, were as moderate as their Chief, he &s;hould
make no Scruple of joining with them; but
that &s;ome of them he fore&s;aw, would carry
their Pa&s;&s;ion and Revenge too far, and mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
involve the Innocent with the Guilty.</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="200">
However, in the main he approv'd the De|&s;ign,
as the Cau&s;e of Liberty, and in &s;ome
mea&s;ure contributed towards the Succe&s;s, tho'

In&s;tance recorded of him, wherein he di&s;cover'd
&s;ome little Sparks of Humanity and Remor&s;e,
which yet he was far from valuing him&s;elf up|on.
For &s;eeing a famous Tragoedian act in

out of the Theatre, but &s;ent to bid the Actor

all Opportunities of advancing them&s;elves upon

was principally between the <HI>Tegeans</HI> and

touch'd the Mony, apprehending they might

be to embroil Matters &s;till more; and there|&s;ore

<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">had been drawn into the War on their Account;
that therefore they had acted treacherou&s;ly with

was deliver'd in &s;o magi&s;terial and menacing

time to be lo&s;t, in providing again&s;t the wor&s;t
that could happen.</P>
<P>Accordingly they &s;ent to the <HI>Athenians</HI> and

to ask their A&s;&s;i&s;tance. They immediately took
the Alarm, and enter'd into a &s;trict Con&s;ede|racy
&s;or their common Defence. And to pre|vent
all Di&s;putes about the Command in the
Army, it was agreed to divide it in &s;uch man|net,
<PB N="178" REF="204">
that each State was to have it within their

had very much at heart: But the <HI>Spar|tans</HI>
being now &s;o ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to give that
up to them, which they had &s;o long contc&s;t|ed
with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> even till they were re|duced
to the greate&s;t Extremity, was a plain
Proof, how much they were terrified with
the Apprechen&s;ions of another De&s;cent into <HI>Pe|loponne&s;us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Epaminondas</HI>
in the mean time began his
March with all the <HI>Boeotians,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Euboean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI>
and a Body of <HI>The&s;&s;alian</HI> Hor&s;e, expecting to
be join'd by the <HI>Argives, Me&s;&s;enions</HI> and many

to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">; which City, with the great|e&s;t

him. The <HI>Spartans,</HI> with their Con&s;ederates,

which they naturally imagin'd would be fir&s;t

<P>But whil&s;t they were &s;ecuring them&s;elves on
this Side, <HI>Epaininondas</HI> con&s;idering, that the
City of <HI>Spar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a</HI> was in a manner drain'd for

this Expedition, broke up privately,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epami|nondas en|deavours to &s;urpri&s;e Sparta.</NOTE> and march'd
all Night, in order to &s;urpri&s;e it. But the De|&s;ign
being di&s;cover'd to <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> as he was
upon his March to <HI>Mantinea,</HI> he &s;ent imme|diate
Notice of it to <HI>Sparta,</HI> with Orders to
put the Town in a Po&s;ture of Defence, 'till
he could come in to its Relief; which he did
with &s;uch Expedition, that <HI>Epaminondas</HI> found
him in the City ready to receive him. That
which is here related of <HI>Age&s;ilaus,</HI> is by <HI>Diodo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us
Siculus</HI> a&s;cribed to <HI>Agis</HI> the other <HI>Spartan</HI>
King. However that be, it is certain, that
<HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> had a principal Part in the Defence
of the City. The few Forces in it were po&s;t|ed
to the be&s;t Advantage, that the Time and
other Circum&s;tances would admit of; and the
old Men and Boys were placed on the Tops of
the Hou&s;es, to annoy the Enemy with Darts and
Stones. <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> tho' he found by this
Di&s;po&s;ition, that his De&s;ign was di&s;cover'd, yet
made an A&s;&s;ault at &s;everal Parts of the City,
but met with the mo&s;t vigorous Oppo&s;ition.
<HI>Age&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ans</HI> &s;aw there was now no room for that
Caution or Cunning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> Agehlau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> which had &s;erved him
upon other Occa&s;ions: Wherefore putting all
upon a de&s;perate Pu&s;h, he exerted him&s;elf far
beyond what could be expected from his Years,
and, by dint of Valour, repuls'd the Enemy.
But great Part of the Glory of this Action
was due to his Son <HI>Archidamus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> who having le&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

He pa&s;s'd the River in open Defiance
of the <HI>Thebans;</HI> then march'd up an Eminence

&s;o lately beat the <HI>Spartans,</HI> when they had the
Advantage both of the Ground, and the Num|bers.
He who &s;ignaliz'd him&s;elf mo&s;t as a pri|vate
Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>and of</HI> I&s;a|das.</NOTE> was <HI>I&s;adas</HI> the Son of <HI>Phabidas.</HI>
He was a very beautiful, large and well-pro|portion'd
Youth, &s;carce arrived at the Age of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Manhood. He had ju&s;t anointed him&s;elf at
Home, when the Alarm being given, he ru&s;h'd
out without any Arms, and almo&s;t naked; then
&s;natching a Spear in one Hand, and a Sword
in the other, he broke into the thicke&s;t of his
Enemies, and bore down all before him. The
<HI>Ephori,</HI> after the Action was over, gave him a
Garland as the Reward of his Gallantry; but
then, to keep up the Rigour of their Di&s;ci|pline,
fined him a thou&s;and <HI>Drachmas,</HI> for go|ing
into the Battle unarmed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spartan</HI> Forces were now come up from
<HI>Mantinca,</HI> and were follow'd by mo&s;t of the
Confederates;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> &s;o that <HI>Epaminondas</HI> finding no|thing
more to be done on that Side, drew of
his Army, and turn'd towards <HI>Mantinea,</HI> which
he judged to be now quite de&s;encele&s;s. For
be&s;ides that the Troops were drawn out of it,
the Inhabitants were &s;catter'd about in the Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">,
having taken that Opportunity, whil&s;t the War
<PB N="181" REF="207">
was removed into another Quarter, to get in
their Harve&s;t. Where&s;ore he re&s;olved to attack
the Town; and fir&s;t order'd the Hor&s;e thither,
who found the People di&s;pers'd in the manner
they had been informed, and all things to Ap|pearance,
as they expected. But it happen'd,
that &s;ix thou&s;and <HI>Athenian</HI> Auxiliaries, who
coming by Sea, knew nothing of what had
pa&s;s'd at <HI>Sparta,</HI> and having pa&s;s'd the <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI>
in order to join the Confederates, as they &s;up|po&s;ed,
in <HI>Mantinea,</HI> were ju&s;t got into the Town;
and without &s;taying to refre&s;h them&s;elves, or
their Hor&s;es, march'd out, and gave the <HI>The|bans</HI>
Battle. After an ob&s;tinate Di&s;pute, with
&s;ome Lo&s;s on both Sides, the <HI>Athenians</HI> got the
better,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mantinea <HI>reliev'd by the</HI> A|theniens.</NOTE> and took tho&s;e, who were without the
Walls, under their Protection. This Action
was a very &s;harp one, but not deci&s;ive; and
is to be con&s;ider'd rather as a Skirmi&s;h, and
a Prelude to what happen'd afterwards, than
as a Victory. However it was of more im|mediate
Con&s;equence to the <HI>Mantineans,</HI> who,
without &s;uch a &s;ea&s;onable and miraculous Re|lie&s;,
mu&s;t have been lo&s;t. And <HI>Hegelochus,</HI>
who commanded this Body of <HI>Athenians,</HI> ob|tain'd
great Honour by making &s;uch a Stand
again&s;t the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who were much &s;uperior
in Numbers, and were al&s;o &s;upported by the
<HI>The&s;&s;alian</HI> Hor&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Epaminondas</HI> was very much piqu'd at the
ill Succe&s;s of the&s;e two la&s;t Enterpri&s;es, which he
<PB N="182" REF="208">
was a&s;raid would le&s;&s;en him in the Opinion
of his Allies, and &s;ully the Glory of his former
A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">chievements; and therefore thought him&s;elf
obliged to attempt &s;omething further, to &s;up|port
his own and his Country's Honour, and
to keep up the Spirits of tho&s;e, whom he had
taken under his Protection. And as the Time
allotted him for this Expedition was very near
expiring, he had no time to lo&s;e. Be&s;ides he
was got &s;o far into the Enemies Country, and
they were &s;o well prepared &s;or him, and watch'd
his Motions &s;o narrowly, that he thought he
could not ea&s;ily &s;ecure his Retreat without fight|ing;
or that if he did, it would be abandoning
and &s;acrificing his Allies. The&s;e Con&s;iderati|ons
determin'd him to proceed immediately
to Action, and, by one deci&s;ive Battle, either
to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> or to
fall honourably in the Attempt.</P>
<P>Accordingly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> upon the <HI>Spartans</HI> coming to the
Relie&s; of the <HI>Mantincans,</HI> he prepar'd to attack
them; and this drew on a general Engagement
of both the Armies, with their re&s;pective Con|&s;ederates.
That of the <HI>Thebans</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of
thirty thou&s;and Foot, and three thou&s;and Hor&s;e;
which was more by a third Part, both of Hor&s;e
and Foot, than the <HI>Spartans</HI> had, with the <HI>Athe|nians,</HI>
and all the re&s;t of their A&s;&s;ociates. The
<HI>Mantineans,</HI> as the War was in their Territori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">,
were in the right Wing, with the <HI>Spartans</HI> next
to them; the <HI>Athenians</HI> in the le&s;t, and the <HI>A|chaans,
<PB N="183" REF="209">
Eleans,</HI> and others of le&s;s Note, made
up the main Body. The <HI>Thebans,</HI> with the <HI>Ar|cadians,</HI>
cho&s;e the Left of their Army to oppo&s;e
the Right of the Enemy; the <HI>Argives</HI> were in
the right; and their main Body con&s;i&s;ted of the
<HI>Euboeans, Locrians, Sicyonians, Me&s;&s;enians, The&s;|&s;alians</HI>
and others: And both the Armies were
flank'd with their Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>But after this Di&s;po&s;ition, <HI>Epaminondas</HI> took a
Compa&s;s, as if he declin'd fighting; and then
made his Troops halt, and lay down their Arms,
with a &s;hew of encamping at a &s;mall Di&s;tance
from the Enemy, hoping, by this Feint, to allay
their Heat, and take off the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion of
their Fury, and then to fall upon them by Sur|pri&s;e;
wich happen'd in a great mea&s;ure as he
expected. For when he afterwards advanc'd to|wards
them, they had quitted their Arms, and
their Hor&s;es, and were &s;o di&s;pers'd about, that
they had much ado to form them&s;elves in time.
However they recover'd the Surpri&s;e, and &s;tood
the Charge with great Re&s;olution. <HI>Epaminondas</HI>
put the I&s;&s;ue of the Battle upon his left Wing, as
he did at <HI>Leuctra;</HI> and his Scheme of breaking
in upon the Enemy was much after the &s;ame
manner, by placing the be&s;t of his Men in Front,
then drawing them up clo&s;e, and narrowing them
to a Point, &s;o as to penetrate like the Beak of a
Gally, as <HI>Xenophon</HI> expre&s;&s;es it. The Engage|ment
began with the Hor&s;e; and it was very hot
and ob&s;tinate, till at length the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who
<PB N="184" REF="210">
bore the Brunt of it, were &s;o gall'd with the Darts
and Slings of the <HI>The&s;&s;alians,</HI> and &s;o over-power'd
with the Numbers of the <HI>Thebans,</HI> that they were
forc'd to give Way, and to leave their Foot ex|pos'd;
but yet they kept them&s;elves in a Body,
&s;o as not to break in upon them. And in their
Retreat, meeting with a Detachment of the <HI>Eu|boeans,</HI>
and other Mercenaries, whom <HI>Epaminondes</HI>
had &s;ent round to attack their Rear, they fell in
among them, and cut them entirely to pieces.
The re&s;t of the <HI>Athenians</HI> in that Wing, were
hard pre&s;s'd by the <HI>Argives,</HI> and the <HI>Theben</HI>
Hor&s;e; but &s;ome <HI>Elean</HI> Hor&s;e, who had been
po&s;ted in the Rear as a Body of Re&s;erve, coming
up to their Relief, they maintain'd their Ground.
Their Hor&s;e in the other Wing made the &s;ame
vigorous Re&s;i&s;tance, but were forc'd at la&s;t to
throw them&s;elves in among their Foot for Pro|tection.</P>
<P>Upon
this the Foot join'd Battle, and &s;ought
with incredible Fury, e&s;pecially the <HI>Spartans</HI> and
the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who were more immediately con|cern'd
in the Event of the Action, and were
never more in Earne&s;t. Their Lances being
broke with the Violence of the Charge, they
clos'd in with their Swords, and &s;tood Foot to
Foot, neither Side abating of their Rage, or
giving back one Inch of Ground. Which <HI>Epa|minondas</HI>
perceiving, form'd a Troop of the mo&s;t
determin'd Men about him, and putting him&s;elf
at the Head of them, made a very vigorous
<PB N="185" REF="211">
Charge upon the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> Phalanx, and
wounded their General with the fir&s;t Javelin he
threw. And his Troop pu&s;hing on with the
&s;ame Ardour, he &s;oon broke the Enemy to
pieces; and then made &s;uch Havock among
them, that the Ground about him was cover'd
with the Bodies of the Slain. But advancing
&s;till forwards, in order to make a thorough Rout
of it, the <HI>Spartans</HI> rallied, and collected them|&s;elves
into a Body, pointing their whole Fury at
him, and throwing an infinite Number of Darts
at him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epami|nondas kill'd.</NOTE> many of which he drew out of his Body,
and retorted at them; till at la&s;t he was mor|tally
wounded by a Javelin, which was &s;aid to
be thrown by <HI>Gryllus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Xenophon,</HI> who
was afterwards kill'd him&s;elf in the &s;ame Battle.
But the Death of <HI>Epaminondas</HI> is by &s;ome a&s;crib'd
to <HI>Anticrates</HI> a <HI>Spartan,</HI> who, as a Reward for &s;o
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">minent a Piece of Service, was exempted from
all publick Offices and Taxes; and <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;ays,
there was one of his De&s;cendants remaining in
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">his Time, who enjoy'd the &s;ame Immunities.
The <HI>Thebans,</HI> upon their General's falling, re|new'd
the Attack, in order to re&s;cue his Body,
and, after a very &s;harp Re&s;i&s;tance on the Part of
the <HI>Spartans,</HI> carried it off. This Mis&s;ortune
put an End to the Action; and both Sides parted,
as it were, by Con&s;ent. <HI>Xenophon</HI> makes it en|tirely
a drawn Battle, and &s;ays, that each Party
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rected Trophies, and ask'd leave to bury their
Dead; that neither of them took any Town,
<PB N="186" REF="212">
nor gain'd any Acce&s;&s;ion of Territory, or any En|crea&s;e
of Power, and that Things remain'd ju&s;t in
the &s;ame Situation after the Battle, as they were
before. But however exact and faithful he may be
in the other Parts of his Hi&s;tory, he is thought
upon this Occa&s;ion to have been a little pre|judic'd,
and to have indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided &s;aying
too much to the Advantage of the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who
had manife&s;tly the Victory, though they were in
too much Concern and Confu&s;ion to pur&s;ue it;
and the only Grounds upon which the Enemy
di&s;puted it with them, was on account of the
<HI>Euboeans</HI> and others, whom the <HI>Athenians,</HI> in their
Retreat, had cut to pieces.</P>
<P><HI>Epaminondas</HI> was carried alive into his Tent,
where, a&s;&s;oon as he recover'd his Speech, he ask'd
his Friends about him, <HI>Whether the Enemy had
taken his Shield from him:</HI> They told him, <HI>It
was &s;afe;</HI> and it being brought to him, he ki&s;s'd
it. He then ask'd, <HI>Which Side had the Victory:</HI>
They told him, <HI>The</HI> Thebans. <HI>All then,</HI> &s;aid he,
<HI>is well.</HI> And &s;oon after, upon the drawing the
Head of the Javelin out of his Body, he &s;ell, as
it were, in the Arms of Victory, and, congra|mlating
the good Fortune of his Country, ex|pired.</P>
<P>There
was &s;omething very great and &s;olemn in
the&s;e Circum&s;tances of his Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha|racter.</NOTE> and &s;uitable to
that ju&s;t and deliberate Firmne&s;s and Compo&s;ure
of Mind, which he had &s;hewn in all the Actions
of his Life. To con&s;ider him in all Re&s;pects, as
<PB N="187" REF="213">
a Soldier, State&s;man and Philo&s;opher, he was not
only, as <HI>Cicero</HI> e&s;teems him, the fir&s;t Man of
<HI>Greece,</HI> but the greate&s;t perhaps that any Age or
Country has produc'd. For all the &s;everal Vir|tues,
which others po&s;&s;e&s;'d &s;ingly, were united
in him, and in &s;o perfect a Degree, as to be
without an Allay of any one Vice, or Failing.
Be&s;ides his natural good Di&s;po&s;ition, he had all
the Advantages of Education, and was furni&s;h'd
with the be&s;t Ma&s;ters, not only for Eloquence
and Philo&s;ophy, but al&s;o for his Exerci&s;es, and
all the other lighter Accompli&s;hments. Hence
it was, that <HI>Polymnis</HI> his Father's Hou&s;e was at
that time one of the be&s;t Schools in <HI>Greece,</HI> and
open to all the learned World. He was indeed
more liberal upon this Head of Expence, than
his Circum&s;tancees would allow; for tho' he was
of one of the be&s;t Families in <HI>Thebes,</HI> he died &s;o
poor, as to leave his Son no other Fortune, than
what he had be&s;tow'd on him in this manner.
It happen'd however, that he neither wanted,
nor de&s;ired one: For he had &s;uch a thorough
Contempt of Riches, that he did not leave enough
to bury him. He was in this, as in many other
Re&s;pects, a Philo&s;oper in Practice and Reality,
and was poor upon Choice; and yet without any

<HI>Ju&s;ian</HI> &s;ays, he was no more de&s;irous of Fame,
than he was of Riches. He did not indeed af|fc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Popularity, or Applau&s;e; he was &s;o mode&s;t,
that all his great Offices were in a manner forc'd
<PB N="188" REF="214">
upon him; and his fir&s;t Motive in all his Under|takings,
was the Honour of his Country: But
yet he had not an In&s;en&s;ibility of Glory with re|gard
to him&s;elf, as may appear from the An&s;wer
he made to his Friends about him when he was
dying. Among other Expre&s;&s;ions of their Grief
for the Lo&s;s of him, they lamented his leaving
no Children behind him: <HI>Yes,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I leave
two fair Daughters, the Victories of</HI> Leuctra <HI>and</HI>
Mantinea, <HI>to perpetuate my Memory.</HI> Upon
another Occa&s;ion, being ask'd, <HI>Whether he thought
him&s;eif, or</HI> Chabrias, <HI>or</HI> Iphicrates, <HI>the better Ge|neral?
'Tis hard,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to judge while we live.</HI>
There are other In&s;tances to prove, that he knew
what was due to his Merit, and that he did not
decline Prai&s;e, tho' he did not covet it. He was
covetous of nothing but his Time, which he em|ploy'd
wholly in the Improvement of his Mind,
or in what he thought might be u&s;eful to the
Publick; and he made even his Diver&s;ions &s;ub|&s;ervient
to that End. His Running, Wre&s;tling,
and other Exerci&s;es of that Kind, were not u&s;ed
by him, as they generally were by others, barely
for Amu&s;ement, or the Glory of excelling in
them, but as Le&s;&s;ons of In&s;truction in the Art of
War. For which Rea&s;on he had an Aver&s;ion to
&s;at Men in the Army, and disbanded one, <HI>who,</HI>
he &s;aid, <HI>would require three or four Shields to cover
his Belly.</HI> He had an extraordinary Genius for
War, and had thoroughly &s;tudied the Theory of
it, before he enter'd upon Action. It has ap|pear'd
<PB N="189" REF="215">
from his Di&s;po&s;ition, and his Manner of
attacking, both at <HI>Leuctra</HI> and <HI>Mantinea,</HI> that he
was particularly well skill'd in the <HI>Tacticks.</HI> That
which has &s;et him in a Light above mo&s;t of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Generals, is the Difficulties and Di&s;|couragements,
which he met with upon his fir&s;t
Appearance in the World. He had to do with
a People, who were &s;unk into a State of Sloth
and Idlene&s;s, and di&s;po&s;ed to Slavery. They were
very low at that time in their Reputation for
Arms: And tho' they had taken &s;ome Part in
the late Wars, it was occa&s;ionally only, and ra|ther
in order to &s;upport them&s;elves by their At|tachment
to tho&s;e who were be&s;t able to protect
them, than with a Sen&s;e of gaining Honour, or
a&s;&s;erting their Freedom. They had but few
Troops, and tho&s;e were without Spirit, or Di&s;|cipline,
and without Officers to conduct them.
This was not the Ca&s;e of the great Captains who
went before him, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Athens</HI> and
<HI>Sparta,</HI> who had Troops ready form'd and di&s;|ciplin'd,
inur'd to Dangers and Fatigue, &s;ir'd
with Ambition, and the Love of their Country,
&s;upported by their Fellow-Citizens, and flu&s;h'd
with Victory: So that their Commanders had
nothing more to do, than to pur&s;ue the Track of
Glory they were in, and to carry on the Service
in the Way they found it. <HI>Epaminondas</HI> had
none of the&s;e Advantages: But by his Courage
and Zeal, and the Force of his Genius, he &s;up|ply'd
the want of them, and, in effect, created
<PB N="190" REF="216">
an Army; which being train'd up by his In|&s;tructions,
and animated by his Example, &s;oon
&s;hew'd the <HI>Thebans,</HI> that they were capable of
acting for them&s;elves, and fighting their own
Battles. From hence it was, that from Auxill|aries
and Dependents, they became Principals,
and put in for their Turn of Superiority in <HI>Grecce.</HI>
It mu&s;t be allow'd, that <HI>Pelopidas</HI> had pav'd the
Way for him in effecting this Change, and that
he had been a&s;&s;i&s;ting to him in mo&s;t of his great
Enterprizes. But without <HI>Epimanondas,</HI> the Work
had been left very imperfect. It was his bold
Defiance of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> that brought on the
Battle of <HI>Leuctra:</HI> And he afterwards went fur|ther
towards the reducing them, than any one
Man, or than all the States of <HI>Greece</HI> together.
And tho' he did not throughly &s;ucceed in it,
he had &s;o di&s;abled and di&s;pirited them, that they
never recover'd their former Reputation and Au|thority.
Among other Marks of their being
humbled, he had brought them to <HI>lengthen their
Mono&s;yllables,</HI> as he him&s;elf expre&s;s'd it, in rally|ing
them upon that a&s;&s;ected and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I don't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> I may be allow'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> But it &s;eeme to be ju&s;tified by the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> which Taci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> de&s;potick Bre|vity,

was vi&s;ible in every Circum&s;tance of his
<PB N="191" REF="217">
Life: And nothing could ever &s;hake his Inte|grity,
or &s;lacken his Zeal &s;or the Publick. The
<HI>Per&s;ians</HI> knowing of what Con&s;equence it was to
fix him in their Intere&s;t, &s;ent <HI>Diomedon</HI> of <HI>Cy|zicus</HI>
to tempt him with a large Sum of Mony.
He fir&s;t gain'd <HI>Micythus,</HI> a particular Favourite
of his, and gave him five Talents to &s;ound him
upon it. But <HI>Epaminondas</HI> rejected the Offer with
Di&s;dain and Indignation, declaring, That he
would not put the Riches of the Univer&s;e in Compe|tition
with the Good of his Country. You, <HI>Dio|medon,
&s;aid he,</HI> don't know me; and I am not
&s;urprized, that you &s;hould form a Judgment of me
from your&s;elf; for which Rea&s;on I forgive you;
but withal advi&s;e you to make the be&s;t of your Way
home, that you may not have an Opportunity of
corrupting others. As for you, <HI>&s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing
him&s;elf to</HI> Micythus, if you don't immediately re|&s;tore
him his Mony, I'll deliver you up to the Ma|gi&s;tracy.
His Genero&s;ity and Friend&s;hip have
&s;ufficiently appear'd in his Behaviour to <HI>Pelopidas.</HI>
He was judicious and grave, but yet af&s;able; he
was continent, patient of Injuries, and very com|pa&s;&s;ionate;
and, to crown all, he was &s;trictly ju&s;t,
and &s;o &s;incere a Lover of Truth, that he would
not tell a Lye even in Je&s;t. He was al&s;o a very
able Speaker, and had gone further in his Search
after Knowledge of all Kinds, than mo&s;t of the
Pailo&s;ophers of his Time, who were &s;o by Pro|fe&s;&s;ion:
And yet he did not value him&s;elf upon
it, or make any Shew of it; and it was &s;aid of
<PB N="192" REF="218">
him in this Re&s;pect, <HI>That Nobody knew more than
he, and &s;poke le&s;s.</HI> Study was indeed his darling
Pa&s;&s;ion; and he was &s;o devoted to it, that he
may be con&s;ider'd almo&s;t as a &s;ingle In&s;tance of
one, who acquitted him&s;elf &s;o well to the Pub|lick
again&s;t the natural Bent of his Inclination.
It was look'd upon as Matter of A&s;toni&s;hment,
that a Man who was &s;o much hid from the World,
and buried, as it were, in Books, &s;hould break out
at once into &s;o great, and &s;o tumultuous a Scene
of Action; that he &s;hould negotiate the Intere&s;ts
of his Country abroad, manage the Government
at home, and lead an Army with &s;uch Succe&s;s
again&s;t the united Powers of <HI>Greece.</HI> But he had
a Capacity for every thing, and applied him&s;elf
to every thing; and when he was once rou&s;ed
by a Sen&s;e of what the Publick expected from
him, he gave up his belov'd Retirement, and
was from thenceforwards in &s;uch continual Mo|tion,
that Nobody every did &s;o much in &s;o &s;hort
a Time. When the <HI>Thebans</HI> were once brought
into Action, he re&s;olv'd to keep them up to it:
If I am your General, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> you mu&s;t be Sol|diers.
<HI>Boeotia,</HI> as being an open flat Country, <HI>he
told them,</HI> was the Stage of War; and that they
could keep it no longer than they had their Hands
<HI>upon their Shields.</HI> It was by the&s;e Maxims, and
this Conduct, that he became the Support of his
Country, and a Pattern to the greate&s;t Captains
of the pre&s;ent, and &s;ucceeding Times. <HI>Philopae|men,</HI>
who is call'd the la&s;t of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> made
<PB N="193" REF="219">
it his Study to imitate him; and is &s;aid to have
come very little &s;hort of him in his Valour and Con|duct,
and his Integrity. But he was more rough
and cholerick, and had too much of the Soldier
in his common Deportment; whereas <HI>Epami|nondas</HI>
was cool and gentle, and had nothing of
Fiercene&s;s, but in the Field. Upon the whole,
he rais'd the Glory of <HI>Thebes</HI> to an Heighth
beyond any of her Neighbours at that Time,
and that &s;o &s;uddenly, that it was &s;aid to be born
with him: And it will appear by the Sequel of
the Story, how far it may be likewi&s;e &s;aid to
have expir'd with him.</P>

<PB N="195" REF="221">
Ob&s;tinacy equal to the Importance of it, which
was the fixing the Empire of <HI>Greece.</HI> And
this mu&s;t of cour&s;e have have been transferr'd
to the <HI>Thebans</HI> upon their Victory, if they had
not lo&s;t the Fruits of it by the Death of their
General, who was the Soul of all their Coun|&s;els
and De&s;igns. This bla&s;ted all their Hopes,
and put out their &s;udden Blaze of Power, al|mo&s;t
as &s;oon as it was kindled. However They
did not pre&s;ently give up their Preten&s;ions;
They were &s;till rank'd among the Leading
States, and made &s;everal further Struggles; but
they were faint and ineffectual, and &s;uch as
were rather for Life and Being, than for Su|periority
and Dominion. They propo&s;ed no|thing
further to them&s;elves at pre&s;ent, than an
honourable Peace; and this was according to
the Opinion of <HI>Epaminondas</HI> him&s;elf, who, when
he lay wounded in his Tent, inquir'd after
tho&s;e whom he judged mo&s;t proper to &s;uc|ceed
him in the Command; and finding they
were kill'd in the Battle, advi&s;ed them to make
Peace; which they ea&s;ily concluded; for their
Enemies were as weary of the War, as them|&s;elves.
The Conditions were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Peace renew'd by all but the <HI>Spar|tans.</HI></NOTE> <HI>That every one
&s;hould retain what they were now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of,
and hold it independent of any other Power.</HI>
Hereupon all the States of <HI>Greece</HI> enter'd in|to
a League Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive, except|ing
only the <HI>Spartans,</HI> who refus'd to ratify the
Treaty, becau&s;e the <HI>Me&s;&s;enians</HI> were included
<PB N="196" REF="222">
in it. This Oppo&s;ition was rais'd chiefly by
<HI>Age&s;ilaus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Age&s;ilaus <HI>cen&s;ur'd for it.</HI></NOTE> who was therefore look'd upon as
&s;tubborn and refractory, and an unrea&s;onable
Protracter of the War, e&s;pecially as he had no
Mony to carry it on, but what he was to rai&s;e
by Loans and heavy Taxes. And his Stick|ling
with &s;o much Ob&s;tinacy at this Time for
the Country of <HI>Me&s;&s;enia,</HI> revived in the Minds
of the People, the great Extent of Territory,
and the great Dominion both by Sea and Land,
that he had lo&s;t &s;ince his Acce&s;&s;ion to the
Throne.</P>
<P>But whatever Cen&s;ure he had incurr'd by
this Proceeding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 104. 3. <HI>His Tran|&s;actions in</HI> Aegypt.</NOTE> his next Enterpri&s;e, which
was the la&s;t Scene of his Life, was &s;till more
blameable, at lea&s;t with regard to him&s;elf, tho'
it did not &s;o much affect the Intere&s;t of his
Country. <HI>Tachos,</HI> who had u&s;urped the King|dom
of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> being at War with the <HI>Per|&s;ians,</HI>
engaged <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with a
Body of <HI>Spartans.</HI> Accordingly he enter'd in|to
that Service, expecting to have the &s;ole Com|mand
of the Army. Upon his Arrival in
<HI>Aegypt,</HI> all the great Officers of the Crown
went to pay their Compliments to him; and
the whole Country flock'd down to the Shore
to &s;ee the Man, who&s;e Reputation in Arms
had made &s;o much Noi&s;e in the World. But
they were much di&s;appointed, when, in&s;tead of
the great and awful Prince they look'd for,
they found a little old Man of a contemptible
<PB N="197" REF="223">
Pre&s;ence, lying on the Gra&s;s, his Cloaths thread|bare,
and his Hair uncomb'd, and rejecting
their rich Pre&s;ents of Sweetmeats and Perfumes,
which he told them, they might give to his Slaves
the <HI>Helots.</HI> He join'd the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Army,
which con&s;i&s;ted of eighty thou&s;and Men, be&s;ides
ten thou&s;and hired Troops, whereof one thou|&s;and
were <HI>Spartans.</HI> But <HI>Tachos</HI> deceiv'd him
in his Expectations of being General, and would
allow him no other Command than that
of the <HI>Mercenaries</HI> at Land, committing to <HI>Cha|brias,</HI>
who came in as a Voluntier from <HI>Athens,</HI>
the Charge of his Fleet, and re&s;erving to him|&s;elf
the chief Command over all. <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> was
otherwi&s;e treated by him with &s;o much In&s;o|lence,
and in a manner &s;o much below his
Spirit and Dignity, that he took an Opportu|nity
to fall in with <HI>Nectanebus</HI> his Son, or ra|ther
his Nephew, who had revolted from him,
and got him&s;elf to be proclaim'd King in his
&s;tead. And the People being generally on his
Side, <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> join'd with them, and drove <HI>Ta|thos</HI>
out of his Kingdom. He had no &s;ooner
withdrawn him&s;elf, but another Competitor
&s;tarted up, and march'd again&s;t <HI>Nectanebus</HI> with
an Army of an hundred thou&s;and Men, who
&s;hut him up in one of his Towns, and laid
Siege to it. When the Works were pretty
well advanc'd, and the Lines of Circumvalla|tion
drawn almo&s;t round the Place, <HI>Nectanebus</HI>
threw him&s;elf among the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and &s;ally|ing
<PB N="198" REF="224">
out by Night at the Gap where the Lines
were unfini&s;hed, drew up his Forces, and ea&s;ily
routed tho&s;e of the Enemy, who were entang|led
and encompa&s;&s;ed by their own Works.
This was owing intirely to the Advice and
Conduct of <HI>Age&s;ilaus,</HI> who improved this Vi|ctory
by &s;everal others, 'till he had &s;ettled
<HI>Nectanebus</HI> in full and quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
Throne. <HI>Diodorus</HI> relates this Part differently,
as if <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> had reconcil'd him&s;elf to <HI>Tachos,</HI>
and rein&s;tated him in the Kingdom. But this
re&s;ts &s;ingly upon his Authority; and the other
Account is more natural, as well as more ge|neral.
<HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> acquitted him&s;elf extremely well
as to the military Part of this Expedition; but
it does not in other Re&s;pects redound much
to his Honour. One chief Motive of his un|dertaking
it, was Gain; which he cover'd un|der
a pretence of &s;upplying the Nece&s;&s;ities of
the State. But the letting him&s;elf out to hire
to a Barbarian, and &s;erving under an <HI>Aegyptian</HI>
Rebel, as a Captain only of a Band of <HI>Mer|cenaries,</HI>
was thought very unbecoming a <HI>Spar|tan</HI>
King, e&s;pecially of his Age and Character.
He fir&s;t made a mean Figure by entering into
that Service, and then a &s;candalous one by de|&s;erting
it, and joining with the Enemy of him,
whom he came to as an Auxiliary. He en|deavour'd
to ju&s;tify him&s;elf by &s;everal fal&s;e Pre|tences;
and, according to the common Plea of
the <HI>Spartans</HI> in the like Ca&s;es, call'd it Acting
<PB N="199" REF="225">
for the Benefit of his Country. But whatever
Name he gave it, it was certainly a foul Ac|tion,
and <HI>Plutarch</HI> calls it downright Treachery.
And it was more &s;o in him, becau&s;e it was
purely his own Act, without being tied down
by any expre&s;s Orders from the Government
of <HI>Sparta.</HI> The Winter following <HI>Nectanebus</HI>
di&s;mi&s;s'd him, with great Marks of Civility
and Gratitude for the Services he had done
him, and gave him two hundred and thirty
Talents of Silver, with which he &s;ail'd home|ward,
but was drove by Stre&s;s of Weather up|on
a de&s;art Shore of <HI>Africa,</HI> call'd <HI>The Haven
of Menelaus;</HI> where he &s;icken'd and died,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Death.</NOTE> being
full eighty four Years old, of which he had
reigned forty one.</P>
<P>He was &s;o extraordinary a Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Cha|racter.</NOTE> and had &s;o
many mixt Qualities, that be&s;ides what has
been already ob&s;erv'd of him in the cour&s;e of
the Hi&s;tory, it may be proper to take a more
di&s;tinct View of him. He &s;et out in the World
with &s;trong Prejudices again&s;t him, both as to
his Per&s;on and his Preten&s;ions. The fir&s;t of
them he overcame by the Sprightline&s;s of his
Air, and his Good-humour, with a way he
had of je&s;ting upon him&s;elf, which prevented
others u&s;ing the &s;ame Freedom with him.
However he was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his Defects, that
he would not &s;uffer any Picture or Statue to be
made of him in his Life-time, and utterly for|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">id
the doing it after his Death. His Way
<PB N="200" REF="226">
to the Throne was attended with greater Dif|ficulties,
which yet he got over by his Spirit
and Addre&s;s, and by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his
Friends, particularly of <HI>Ly&s;ander,</HI> who in effect
put the Crown upon his Head. And in that
re&s;pect, it was made a Charge of Ingratitude
upon <HI>Age&s;ilaus,</HI> that he had afterwards upon a
&s;light Pretence thrown him off. But he him|&s;elf
was the Cau&s;e of it; he valued him&s;elf too
much upon his Services to him; and his Beha|viour
to him in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> has been &s;hewn to be
&s;o arrogant and a&s;&s;uming, that it might very
well ju&s;tify his &s;ending him away from him,
when he found he could no longer act with
him. <HI>Ly&s;ander,</HI> full of Re&s;entment, upon his
Return form'd a powerful Party again&s;t him;
to break which, he &s;ingled out the Ring-lea|ders,
&s;ome of whom he &s;ent away upon foreign
Services; others he got to be accu&s;ed of Ava|rice
and Inju&s;tice in their Employments; and
then made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to bring them off,
thereby obliging them to become his Friends;
and &s;o by degrees he wore out the Faction.
As he was a younger Son, he was bred up with
more Severity and Subjection, than the imme|diate
Heirs of the Crown; and by the Obe|dience
he paid to the Laws as a private Man,
he was better fitted for the Government, when
he came to it. He made great court to the
<HI>Ephori,</HI> and the Senate, even to a Shew of
Reverence, and by the Deference he paid to
<PB N="201" REF="227">
their Power, he &s;ecretly advanc'd his own, and
by that Means carried the Prerogative higher
than any of his Predece&s;&s;ors. But his Popula|rity
grew at la&s;t &s;u&s;pected; in&s;omuch that he is
&s;aid to have been fined by the <HI>Ephori</HI> for <HI>mono|polizing</HI>
the Citizens, who were look'd upon as the
common Goods of the Republick. He was re|markable
for his Continency and Moderation;
and kept up the old <HI>Spartan</HI> Plainne&s;s and Fru|gality
even to Affectation, not allowing his Wife
and Daghter to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by their
Dre&s;s, and living in the &s;ame Hou&s;e that be|long'd
to <HI>Ari&s;todemus</HI> his Predece&s;&s;or above &s;even
hundred Years before, nor &s;uffering &s;o much as
the Door of it to be repair'd. Yet notwith|&s;tanding
this rigid Appearance, there was no|thing
of Stiffne&s;s or Moro&s;ene&s;s in his Behaviour;
he treated every Body with Candour and Affa|bility,
and had &s;uch a Complacency and Agree|ablene&s;s
in his Conver&s;ation, as made him ami|able
to the la&s;t. He was very &s;ond of his Chil|dren,
and would often enter into their little Sports
with them. Being one Day &s;urpriz'd by a Friend,
as he was riding with them on an Hobby-hor&s;e,
<HI>Say nothing of it,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>till you are a Father
your&s;elf.</HI> He was generous to his Enemies, not
detracting any thing from their due Merit, ea&s;ily
forgiving, and never taking any unju&s;t Advan|tage
again&s;t them. On the other hand he was
too partial to his Friends, whom, in all Ca&s;es,
right or wrong, he thought him&s;elf oblig'd to
<PB N="202" REF="228">
&s;upport: Of which there is an In&s;tance in a
Letter of his to <HI>Idrieus,</HI> Prince of <HI>Caria,</HI> where|in
he &s;ays, <HI>If</HI> Nicias <HI>be innocent, acquit him; if
he be guilty, acquit him upon my account; however
be &s;ure to acquit him.</HI> Of the &s;ame Kind was his
interpo&s;ing in Behalf of <HI>Phaebidas</HI> and <HI>Sphodrias;</HI>
and yet the Con&s;equence of it was, in a great
mea&s;ure, the engaging <HI>Sparta</HI> in the <HI>Leuctrian</HI>
War. It was a Saying of his, <HI>That to be &s;trait|laced
in Point of Ju&s;tice when one's Friend is con|cerned,
is only a Pretence for de&s;erting him.</HI> Yet
Nobody talk'd more of Ju&s;tice upon other Oc|ca&s;ions
than he did; in&s;omuch that &s;ome about
him expatiating one Day upon the Grandeur of
the King of <HI>Per&s;ia, Wherein,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Age&s;ilaus, does
his Grandeur con&s;i&s;t? Or how is he greater than I
am, if he be not more ju&s;t?</HI> By which he would
have it under&s;tood, that Ju&s;tice was the Rule of
all his Actions. But he has not given many In|&s;tances
of it, e&s;pecially in his publick Character;
wherein he was &s;o different from what he was
in his private Life, that he may be con&s;ider'd
as two different Per&s;ons. His Failings in the
latter were few, and, generally &s;peaking, good-natur'd
ones; but in his Regal and Military
Capacity, his Pa&s;&s;ions were much &s;tronger, and
his Faults more unpardonable. The &s;ame a&s;|piring
Temper which he di&s;cover'd from his
Childhood, and by which he afterwards u&s;urp'd
the Crown, carried him on to the la&s;t Stage of
his Life, and bore down all other Con&s;iderations,
<PB N="203" REF="229">
that &s;tood in the Way of his Ambition. And
yet he manag'd &s;o well, that he pa&s;s'd the fir&s;t
thirty Years of his Reign in great Honour and
E&s;teem: But as he advanc'd further in Years,
he grew more perver&s;e and arbitrary, and withal
more re&s;tle&s;s and impatient, continually forming
new Schemes of Action, and never ea&s;y but in
War; and indeed he had admirable Talents for
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t. He was brave, active and vigilant; he had
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nur'd him&s;elf to the Extremes of Heat and Cold,
and far'd as hard, in other Re&s;pects, as a private
Centinel. He was very careful to keep up the
Courage of his Soldiers; for which Purpo&s;e he
would conceal, or le&s;&s;en the News of a Defeat
in other Parts, or &s;ometimes &s;ub&s;titute the Report
of a Victory in the room of it. He had a more
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">efin'd way of deceiving his Enemies, by pub|li&s;hing
his real De&s;ign of a March or an Attack,
&s;o that they might take it for a Feint, and con|&s;equently
be unprepar'd for him. Nobody knew
better how to u&s;e the Advantages of Time and
Place, or to effect by Stratagem, what he could
not obtain by Force. And notwith&s;tanding his
natural Impetuo&s;ity, he could command him&s;elf
upon Occa&s;ion, and was either cool and tempe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rate,
or daring and de&s;perate, according as the
Ca&s;e requir'd; of which he gave &s;ufficient Proofs
in his Defence of the City of <HI>Sparta.</HI> His Be|haviour
upon that Occa&s;ion, when the Whole
was at Stake, was great and glorious; tho' it
mu&s;t be allow'd at the &s;ame time, that he did
<PB N="204" REF="230">
nothing more than what he ow'd to his Country
who&s;e Intere&s;ts he had &s;acrificed to his implacable
Hatred of the <HI>Thebans</HI> and <HI>Me&s;&s;enians,</HI> and his
in&s;atiable Thir&s;t of Revenge. The <HI>Spartans</HI> were
&s;o &s;en&s;ible of his Abilities, that when he was in
<HI>A&s;ia,</HI> they con&s;tituted him Admiral as well as
General, which was an Honour they had never
before conferr'd on one &s;ingle Per&s;on. His
Power after that Expedition encrea&s;ing in Pro|portion
to the Opinion they had of him, he did
what he would with them, and brought them
into &s;uch a Condition, that they were forc'd to
rely upon him, and to &s;tand or fall with him.
And tho' he &s;av'd them from immediate De|&s;truction,
he had &s;ufficiently drain'd and hara&s;s'd
them, and left them in a mi&s;erable declining
State. <HI>Ly&s;ander</HI> gave the fir&s;t Shock to their
Power by his Pride, and <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> quite broke
it by his Ob&s;tinacy; the fir&s;t made them odious
to their Neighbours, and the latter made them
contemptible. And upon the Whole, it may be
&s;aid, that <HI>Sparta</HI> ow'd her Downfal to the two
greate&s;t Men &s;he ever bred.</P>
<P>The Death of <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> and the Peace
which en&s;u'd upon it, had &s;lacken'd the Zeal of
the principal Powers of <HI>Greece,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The indo|lent State of</HI> Greece.</NOTE> and render'd 'em
too &s;ecure. The <HI>Athenians</HI> more particularly,
when they found them&s;elves deliver'd from him
who kept up their Emulation, grew indolent
and remi&s;s, and abandon'd them&s;elves to their
Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure, being wholly taken up with
<PB N="205" REF="231">
Shews, Sports and Fe&s;tivals. They were natu|rally
too much addicted to the&s;e Sorts of Amu&s;e|ment,
and they had formerly been encourag'd in
them by <HI>Pericles,</HI> who knew how to lead them
by their Inclinations, and took this Method to
ingratiate him&s;elf with them, and to divert them
from in&s;pecting too narrowly into his Admini|&s;tration.
But they now carried the&s;e Diver&s;ions
to a much higher Pitch of Extravagance. They
had &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion for the Stage, that it &s;tifled
in them all other Thoughts, either of Bu&s;ine&s;s, or
of Glory. Poets and Players were become their
only Favourites, and receiv'd the E&s;teem and
Applau&s;e, that was due to the Captains who
had fought their Battles. The very victualling
of their Fleets and Armies was con&s;um'd upon
the Stage. Their Singers and Dancers were
pamper'd up with Marrow and other lu&s;cious
Food, whil&s;t the Admiral and the Captains of
the Ships had no other Provi&s;ions on board, but
Meal, Chee&s;e and Onions. In &s;hort, the Deco|rations,
and other Charges attending the Theatre,
were &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;ays, <HI>It co&s;t more
to repre&s;ent &s;ome of the famous Pieces of</HI> Sophocles
<HI>and</HI> Euripides, <HI>than it had done to carry on the
War again&s;t the Barbarians.</HI> And in order to
&s;upport this Charge, they &s;eiz'd upon the Fund
which had been &s;et apart for the War, with a
Prohibition, upon Pain of Death, even to advi&s;e
the applying it to any other Purpo&s;e. They
not only revers'd this Decree, but went as far
<PB N="206" REF="232">
the other way, making it death to propo&s;e th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
re&s;toring the Fund to the U&s;es, to which
had before been appropriated, under the &s;am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Penalties. By diverting the Cour&s;e of the Sup|plies
in &s;o extraordinary a manner, and enter
taining the idle Citizen at the Expence of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Soldier and Mariner, they &s;eem'd to have n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Remains of that Spirit and Vigour, which they
had exerted in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Wars, when they de|moli&s;h'd
their Hou&s;es to furni&s;h out a Navy, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
when the Women &s;toned a Man to death, who
propos'd to appea&s;e the <HI>Great King,</HI> (as he was
call'd) by paying Tribute, and doing Homag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
to him.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t they were wrapt up in this &s;lothful
Security, and had nothing immediately to ap|prehend
from their old Enemies, either in <HI>Greece</HI>
or <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> they found them&s;elves on a &s;udden
engag'd with a People,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Which the</HI> Macedoni|ans <HI>take ad|vantage of.</HI></NOTE> who were hitherto ob|&s;cure,
and in a manner barbarous. The&s;e were
the <HI>Macedonians;</HI> who, tho' they were hardy,
and warlike enough, had never yet pre&s;um'd to
intermeddle in the Affairs of <HI>Greece.</HI> The Truth
is, they had enough to do at home, to adju&s;t the
Quarrels about the Succe&s;&s;ion of their Kings, and
to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the <HI>Illyrians, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">o|nians,</HI>
and other powerful Neighbours. But &s;e|veral
Circum&s;tances concur'd at this Time to rai&s;e
them out of their Ob&s;curity, and to bring them
into a new Scene of Action; which by Degrees
wrought &s;uch a thorough Change in the State of
<PB N="207" REF="233">
<HI>Greece,</HI> that it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take a cur&s;ory
View of their Affairs, and to con&s;ider them con|nectedly
with tho&s;e of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> at lea&s;t &s;o
far as may &s;erve to &s;hew, by what Steps this
Change was effected.</P>
<P>They may al&s;o upon another Account &s;eem to
require a Place in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Story;<NOTE PLACE="marg">How far they may be con&s;ider'd as Greci|ans.</NOTE> for their
fir&s;t Kings were of <HI>Grecian</HI> Extraction. But they
are not &s;o much entitled to it from their De&s;cent,
as from their Exploits, by which the very Name
of <HI>Greece</HI> was in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t, and &s;wal|low'd
up in that of <HI>Macedonia.</HI> Before their
later Atchievements, which brought about this
great Revolution, they were no otherwi&s;e con&s;i|der'd
as a Part of <HI>Greece,</HI> than many other Bor|derers,
who were originally planted from thence,
but having afterwards little or no Intercour&s;e with
their Mother-Country, contracted the Habits and
Manners of the Natives where they &s;ettled, and
from thence were look'd upon as one and the
&s;ame People with them, and in the &s;ame Degree
of Barbari&s;m. This was the Ca&s;e of mo&s;t of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Colonies: And therefore, tho' I have had
frequent occa&s;ion to mention them, I have not
enter'd further into their Story, than as it has
born relation to <HI>Greece,</HI> either on account of their
Wars or Alliances with it, or of their being pro|tected
by it, or becoming tributary to it, or of
&s;uch other Engagements and Dependences, as
have blended their Affairs with tho&s;e of the <HI>Gre
cians,</HI> and made the Relation of them a nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="208" REF="234">
Part of their Hi&s;tory. Thus much may &s;uffice
to account for my not having treated the mo&s;t
remarkable of the&s;e Colonies &s;o fully and di&s;tinct|ly,
as might be expected from the Figure they
have made in the World; &s;uch as <HI>Sicily, Crete,</HI>
and &s;ome others of the I&s;lands, with the <HI>Le&s;&s;er
A&s;ia,</HI> and &s;everal other Parts of the Continent.
But it ought to be con&s;ider'd, that where their
Fame and Grandeur has been owing more to
their Tran&s;actions with other People, than with
the <HI>Grecians,</HI> mo&s;t of the Particulars concerning
them do not fall within the Compa&s;s of my De|&s;ign,
but belong more properly to a &s;eparate
Hi&s;tory of their own, or to that of the Nation,
which they have had mo&s;t to do with.</P>
<P>The <HI>Macedonians</HI> were &s;o call'd before the <HI>Gre|cians</HI>
intermix'd with them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ori|ginal.</NOTE> And they were &s;ome
time known by other Names, which they receiv'd
from the fir&s;t Planters, or principal Men either
of the whole Country, or of &s;ome particular
Parts of it. But the Accounts we have of the&s;e
original Founders, like tho&s;e of the <HI>Grecian</HI> States,
are very fabulous and imperfect. The fir&s;t who
is mention'd, with any Degree of Certainty, to
have reign'd in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> was <HI>Caranus,</HI> by Birth
an <HI>Argive,</HI> and &s;aid to be the &s;ixteenth in De&s;cent
from <HI>Hercules.</HI> It was upon this Foundation,
that <HI>Philip</HI> grounded his Preten&s;ions to be of the
Race of <HI>Hercules,</HI> and a&s;&s;um'd to him&s;elf Divine
Honours; wherein he carried his Vanity a great
way, tho' not &s;o far as his Son did after him.
<PB N="209" REF="235">
<HI>Caranus</HI> therefore is commonly reputed to have
led forth a Body of his Countrymen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their fir&s;t Kings.</NOTE> by the Ad|vice
of the Oracle, into the&s;e Parts, where he
&s;ettled, and made him&s;elf King. And yet <HI>He|rodotus,</HI>
contrary to the Opinion of all the later
Writers, makes <HI>Perdiccas</HI> the fir&s;t King. <HI>Sir
I&s;aac Newton</HI> reconciles this Difference by a very
probable Conjecture, that they were Joint-Found|ers
of this Kingdom; that they were both con|temporary,
and of the Royal Family of <HI>Argos,</HI>
from whence they fled about the &s;ame Time, and
at fir&s;t erected &s;mall Principalities in <HI>Macedonia,</HI>
which, after the Death of <HI>Caranus,</HI> became one
under <HI>Perdiccas:</HI> and that this Kingdom was
founded about the 46th or 47th <HI>Olympiad.</HI> From
this Time the <HI>Macedonians</HI> were properly a <HI>Gre|cian</HI>
Colony; and, among other Proofs of their
being &s;o, it is ob&s;ervable, that <HI>Amyntas,</HI> which
was the Name of &s;ome of their &s;ucceeding Kings,
was al&s;o a common Name among the <HI>Argives.</HI>
Another of their Kings was, by virtue of their
<HI>Grecian</HI> Extraction, admitted to the <HI>Olympick</HI>
Games. But whatever Rights and Privileges this
Nation claim'd as <HI>Grecians,</HI> they were generally
treated as <HI>Barbarians,</HI> till &s;uch time as they car|ried
their Arms into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and had trampled upon
the Liberties of <HI>Greece. Caranus</HI> having, accord|ing
to the general Account, reign'd twenty-eight
Years, the Succe&s;&s;ion was continu'd after him to
the Times we are now treating of. But there is
very little worth Notice recorded of the&s;e Kings,
<PB N="210" REF="236">
they being chiefly employ'd in defending them|&s;elves
again&s;t the Incur&s;ions of their Neighbours:
And as to their dome&s;tick Affairs, they were re|markable
only for the frequent Murthers and U|&s;urpations,
which happen'd in the Royal Fa|mily.</P>
<P><HI>Amynlas</HI> the Second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amyntas Father of Philip.</NOTE> who was the Sixteenth in
De&s;cent from <HI>Caranus,</HI> and the Father of that
<HI>Philip</HI> whom we are now to treat of, had much
ado to &s;upport him&s;elf in the Throne; he left
it in a very tottering Condition, and entail'd a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
War with the <HI>Illyrians</HI> and <HI>Olynthians</HI> upon his
Children. By his Wife <HI>Eurydice</HI> he left three
Sons, who all in their turn &s;ucceeded to their Fa|ther,
<HI>Alexander, Perdiccas</HI> and <HI>Philip;</HI> he had
al&s;o a natural Son, call'd <HI>Ptolemy Alorites.</HI> Some
&s;ay, he had a &s;econd Wife, call'd <HI>Gygaea,</HI> and by
her had three more Sons, <HI>Archelaus, Argaeus</HI> or
<HI>Archideus,</HI> and <HI>Menelaus,</HI> who were murder'd by
<HI>Philip.</HI> But this does not &s;eem probable, be|cau&s;e
<HI>Eurydice</HI> appears to have &s;urviv'd <HI>Amyntas,</HI>
and to have been very active in the &s;ucceeding
Reigns. The Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Per|diccas</HI>
was &s;trongly oppos'd; fir&s;t by <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI>
who&s;e Father and him&s;elf had before u&s;urp'd the
Crown, and then by their Brother <HI>Plolemy,</HI> who
is &s;aid to have murder'd <HI>Alexander,</HI> and to have
reign'd three Years upon his Death, till he was
afterwards &s;lain him&s;elf by <HI>Perdiccas. Pau&s;anias</HI>
was drove out by <HI>Iphicrates,</HI> who at this Time
happen'd to be &s;ent by the <HI>Athenians</HI> with a &s;mall
<PB N="211" REF="237">
Fleet into tho&s;e Parts, to make the nece&s;&s;ary
Di&s;po&s;itions for the Siege of <HI>Amphipolis. Eury|dice,</HI>
upon this Occa&s;ion, acco&s;ted him in a very
moving manner: She brought her two Sons <HI>Per|diccas</HI>
and <HI>Philip</HI> to him, and putting one of 'em
between his Arms, and the other upon his Knee,
conjur'd him, by the mutual Friend&s;hip that had
pa&s;s'd between the two Nations, and by the per|&s;onal
Kindne&s;s and Affection that her Husband
had born to him, that he would take the&s;e two
Orphans into his Protection, and defend them
again&s;t the Invader. But this Account of her
Maternal Affection is by no means con&s;i&s;tent with
that which <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> gives of her, That being in
love with her Son-in-law, who is under&s;tood to
be <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> &s;he caus'd her own two Sons <HI>Alex|ander</HI>
and <HI>Perdiccas</HI> to be murder'd, in order to
advance him to the Throne; and that &s;he had
before attempted to de&s;troy her Husband with
the &s;ame View. But the Hi&s;tory of the&s;e two
Kings, <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Perdiccas,</HI> is &s;o confus'd,
that not only the Tran&s;actions of one Reign &s;eem
to be a&s;crib'd to another, but the Tran&s;actions
them&s;elves are al&s;o differently related. As to
<HI>Ptolemy,</HI> the mo&s;t plau&s;ible Account given of him,
is, that upon his Competition with <HI>Perdiccas,</HI>
they referr'd them&s;elves to <HI>Pelopidas,</HI> who ad|judging
the Crown to the latter, the other quitted
his Preten&s;ions: And <HI>Pelopidas,</HI> for the better
Ob&s;ervance of this Agreement, carried <HI>Philip</HI>
with him, among others, as Ho&s;tage to <HI>Thebes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="238">
There are other Occa&s;ions mention'd of his being
given as an Ho&s;tage to the <HI>Illyrians,</HI> both by his
Father, and his Brother <HI>Alexander.</HI> However
that be, it is certain he was at <HI>Thebes</HI> at the Time
of the Death of his Brother <HI>Perdiccas,</HI> who, ac|cording
to the mo&s;t general Accounts, was kill'd
in a Battle with the <HI>Illyrians.</HI></P>
<P>This Accident brought him home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ri&s;e of Philip.</NOTE> and gave
him an Opportunity of exerting tho&s;e Talents,
by which he not only &s;urpa&s;s'd all his Prede|ce&s;&s;ors,
but eclips'd the Fame of all the <HI>Grecians</HI>
of his Time; tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that he
receiv'd his fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions of Glory from 'em,
and that he ow'd a great deal to the Improve|ments
he made under <HI>Epaminondas.</HI> But be&s;ides
the&s;e Advantages, he had great natural Endow|ments,
and a Genius equal to the greate&s;t De|&s;igns;
as may &s;u&s;&s;iciently appear from the Diffi|culties
he had to encounter at his fir&s;t &s;etting out,
when he was &s;carce three and twenty Years old, and
the Means he us'd to overcome them. <HI>Perdiccas</HI>
had left a young Son to &s;ucceed him; &s;o that
<HI>Philip</HI> had no immediate Pro&s;pect of coming to
the Crown. However, upon the News of his
Brother's Death, he &s;tole home privately from
<HI>Thebes,</HI> and taking Advantage of the Con&s;terna|tion
the People were under, and the Dangers
they apprehended from an In&s;ant-Reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A M. 3645. Olymp. 105. 1. <HI>He is de|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">'d King</HI></NOTE> got
him&s;elf at fir&s;t declar'd Protector to his Nephew,
and &s;oon after King in his &s;tead. And indeed
the pre&s;ent Condition of the <HI>Macedonians</HI> requir'd
<PB N="213" REF="239">
a Man of his Prudence and Activity: For they
were &s;urrounded with as many Enemies, as they
had Neighbours. The <HI>Illyrians</HI> flu&s;h'd with their
late Victory, were preparing to march again&s;t
them with a &s;trong Army; the <HI>Paeonians</HI> were
making daily Incur&s;ions upon them; and at the
&s;ame Time the Title to the Crown was conte&s;ted
by <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> and <HI>Argaeus,</HI> the former whereof
was &s;upported by the <HI>Thracians,</HI> and the latter
by the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who for that Purpo&s;e had &s;ent
out a good Fleet, and three thou&s;and Land
Men.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e Circum&s;taces, with &s;o many E|nemies
on his Hands at once, and that before
he was &s;ettled in the Throne, his fir&s;t Part was,
to make &s;ure of his own People, to gain
their Affections, and to rai&s;e their Spirits; for they
were very much di&s;hearten'd, having lo&s;t above
four thou&s;and Men in the late Action with the
<HI>Illyrians.</HI> He &s;ucceeded in the&s;e Points by the
Artfulne&s;s of his Addre&s;s, and the Force of his
Eloquence, of which he was a great Ma&s;ter.
His next Step was to train and exerci&s;e them, and
reform their Di&s;cipline; and it was at this Time,
that he in&s;tituted the famous <HI>Macedonian Phalanx,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He ir&s;ti|tutes the <HI>Macedo|nian</HI> Pha|lanx.</NOTE> 
which did &s;o much Execution. It was an Im|provement
upon the ancient Manner of fighting
among the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who generally drew up their
Foot &s;o clo&s;e, as to &s;tand the Shock of the Ene|my
without being broken. The compleat Pha|lanx
was thought to contain above &s;ixteen thou|&s;and
<PB N="214" REF="240">
Men; tho' it was al&s;o taken in general for
any Company, or Party of Soldiers, and fre|quently
for the whole Body of the Foot. But this
of <HI>Philip's</HI> Invention, is de&s;crib'd by <HI>Polybius</HI> to
be a long Square, con&s;i&s;ting of eight thou&s;and
Pikemen, &s;ixteen deep, and five hundred in Front,
the Men &s;tanding &s;o clo&s;e together, that the Pikes
of the fifth Rank were extended three Foot be|yond
the Line of the Front. The re&s;t, who&s;e
Di&s;tance from the Front made their Pikes u&s;ele&s;s,
re&s;ted them upon the Shoulders of tho&s;e who
&s;tood before them, and &s;o locking them together
in File, pre&s;s'd forwards to &s;upport and pu&s;h on
the former Ranks, whereby the A&s;fault was ren|der'd
more violent and irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>In this Year died <HI>Xenophon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Xenophon his Death, and Cha|racter.</NOTE> and in the nine|tieth
Year of his Age. Notwith&s;tanding the
Glory he had acquir'd by his <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Expedition,
he was bani&s;h'd <HI>Athens</HI> for having been engag'd
in it: For <HI>Cyrus</HI> having been too great a Fa|vourer
of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> the <HI>Athenians</HI> did not
think he ought to receive any Countenance or
A&s;&s;i&s;tance from them in the Quarrel with his
Brother <HI>Artaxerxes.</HI> Thereupon <HI>Xenophon</HI> cho&s;e
to return again into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where he join'd <HI>Age|&s;ilaus;</HI>
and there they contracted a &s;trict Friend|&s;hip,
which continu'd as long as they liv'd. Up|on
which of the&s;e two Expeditions it was, that
the Sentence of Bani&s;hment was pa&s;s'd again&s;t
him, is not determin'd: But he had by both of
them incurr'd the Di&s;plea&s;ure of his Fellow|Citizens,
<PB N="215" REF="241">
who look'd upon him as not being well
affected to the Intere&s;t of his Country. He has
not by his Actions given any Marks of his En|mity
again&s;t it: But it is certain, that he was a
great Admirer of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Manners and Con|&s;titution,
and had a very indifferent Opinion of
the <HI>Athenian Democracy.</HI> Upon his &s;econd Re|turn
into <HI>Greece,</HI> he re&s;ided at <HI>Scillonte,</HI> a Town
in the <HI>Elean</HI> Territory, but at that Time under
the Dominion of <HI>Sparta.</HI> But upon the Inva|&s;ion
of <HI>Laconia</HI> by <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> he quitted that
Neighbourhood, and retir'd to <HI>Corinth,</HI> where he
&s;pent the Remainder of his Days. It is to the
Lei&s;ure he enjoy'd in the&s;e Places of Retreat,
that we owe mo&s;t of his Hi&s;torical and other
Writings; by which he appears to have po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
more different Talents, and to have been more
thoroughly accompli&s;h'd, than any Man of his
Time, not only as a Captain, Philo&s;opher, Ora|tor
and Hi&s;torian, but being likewi&s;e well skill'd
in Politicks, in Hor&s;eman&s;hip and Hunting, in
Tillage and Planting. He had al&s;o the Advan|tage
of a very beautiful Per&s;on, with a plea&s;ing
A&s;pect, which be&s;poke that Candour and Sim|plicity,
for which he was &s;o remarkable, both in
his Manners and his Writings.</P>
<P>His Character as an Hi&s;torian having already
been de&s;crib'd in the Account I have given of
the Authors, from whom this Hi&s;tory is collected,
I will here only add an Ob&s;ervation, that he was
the fir&s;t Philo&s;opher in <HI>Greece,</HI> who wrote an
<PB N="216" REF="242">
Hi&s;tory. And to this it may be a&s;crib'd,
that he has expre&s;s'd Nature better than mo&s;t
other Hi&s;torians of his Time: His Conceptions
were clear, and that made his Diction &s;o. This
regular way of thinking, and dige&s;ting his Mat|ter,
he learnt of <HI>Socrates,</HI> under whom he &s;tudied.
Nothing is more to be admir'd in him, than the
Affection he bore to his Ma&s;ter. And in this
Part <HI>Plato</HI> agreed with him; but there was o|therwi&s;e
no good Under&s;tanding between them:
Which is the more extraordinary, becau&s;e they
were both equally of a mild and amiable Di&s;|po&s;ition,
and had no Enemies, but &s;uch as their
Virtue had created them. The Cau&s;e a&s;&s;ign'd
by <HI>Diogenes Laertius</HI> for their Di&s;agreement,
was a Rival&s;hip in their Writings; and in &s;up|prot
of this Opinion, it is &s;aid, that <HI>Xenophon</HI>
wrote his <HI>Cyripaedia,</HI> as the Picture of a ju&s;t Mo|narchy,
in Oppo&s;ition to that which <HI>Plato</HI> had
drawn of a perfect Common-wealth. It is a
Que&s;tion among the Learned, how far this Piece
of <HI>Xenophon</HI> will bear being examin'd according
to the &s;trict Rules of Hi&s;tory; and whether it
ought not rather to be look'd upon only as a
more mode&s;t and in&s;tructive Species of Romance.
There is likewi&s;e great Allowance to be made
for his Character of <HI>Age&s;laus,</HI> which is too much
in the Stile of Panegyrick. But his clo&s;e Inti|macy
with that Prince, had made him partial
to his Failings. He extols his per&s;onal Bravery,
and his other private Virtues, and very ju&s;tly:
<PB N="217" REF="243">
But he does not con&s;ider him enough in his pub|lick
Capacity, as one, who, upon the Merit of
his Services, had got more Power into his Hands,
than was u&s;ually allow'd to the <HI>Spartan</HI> Kings,
and, by his Ra&s;hne&s;s and Ob&s;tinacy, had made
an ill u&s;e of it, almo&s;t to the De&s;truction of his
Country.</P>
<P>When <HI>Philip</HI> had made &s;ome proper Regula|tion
of his Affairs at home, he began to look
abroad, in order to divert the Storms which
threaten'd him from all Quarters. By Mony
and Promi&s;es he made up Matters, for the pre|&s;ent,
with &s;uch of his Enemies, as lay neare&s;t
to him, and then turn'd his Forces again&s;t the
<HI>Athenians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip de|feats the Athenians.</NOTE> who were march'd up to <HI>Methone,</HI> to
a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Argaeus.</HI> He gave them Battle, and de|feated
them; and the Death of <HI>Argaeus,</HI> who
was kill'd in the Action, put an End to that
Di&s;pute: For he permitted the <HI>Athenians,</HI> when
they were in his Power, to return home. This
In&s;tance of his Moderation gain'd &s;o far upon
them, that they &s;oon after concluded a Peace
with him; which yet he ob&s;erv'd no longer,
than it &s;erv'd his De&s;ign of &s;ecuring the other
Part of his Dominions.</P>
<P>Accordingly he march'd Northward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 105. 2. Subdues the Paeonians, and the Il|lyrians.</NOTE> where
he broke with the <HI>Paeonians,</HI> and &s;ubdu'd them;
then fell upon the <HI>Illyrains,</HI> and having kill'd
above &s;even thou&s;and of them in a pitch'd Battle,
oblig'd them to re&s;tore all their Conque&s;ts in
<HI>Macedonia.</HI> He had al&s;o &s;hut up the Pa&s;&s;age of
<PB N="218" REF="244">
the <HI>Thracians;</HI> but yet did not think it &s;uffici|ently
&s;ecur'd, without making him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of
<HI>Amphipolis,</HI> which was very commodiou&s;ly &s;itu|ated
on the River <HI>Strymon,</HI> and was the <HI>Key</HI> of
that Side of his Dominions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seizes Am|phipolis.</NOTE> He knew the Im|portance
of it, and therefore po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of
it in the Beginning of his Reign. This was the
Grounds of his Quarrel with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who
claim'd it as one of their Colonies, and made
&s;uch a Point of it, that their &s;etting up <HI>Argaeus</HI>
again&s;t him, was not &s;o much for his own Sake,
or for the Credit of impo&s;ing a King upon the
<HI>Macedonians,</HI> as it was with a View to get the
City re&s;tor'd to them by his Means, in ca&s;e he
&s;hould have &s;ucceeded in his Preten&s;ions. <HI>Philip</HI>
was &s;en&s;ible of their Drift; and finding it ne|ce&s;&s;ary
at that Time to keep &s;ome Mea&s;ures with
them, would neither keep the Place him&s;elf, nor
let them have it, but took a middle Cour&s;e, and
declar'd it a Free City, thereby leaving the In|habitants
to throw off their Dependence on their
old Ma&s;ters, and making it appear to be their
own Act. But the City continu'd no longer in
this State, than till he found him&s;elf at liberty to
make a more thorough Conque&s;t of it; which at
this Time he ea&s;ily effected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 105. 3.</NOTE> thro' the Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s
of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who refus'd to &s;end any Relief
to it, alledging in their Excu&s;e, that it would be
a Breach of the Peace, which they had con|cluded
with <HI>Philip</HI> the Year before. But the
Truth is, he trick'd them out of it, by a Pro|mi&s;e
<PB N="219" REF="245">
of delivering it up to them: But in&s;tead of
keeping his Word with them, he made further
Encroachments, by &s;eizing on <HI>Pydna</HI> and <HI>Poti|dea;</HI>
the latter of which being garri&s;on'd by <HI>A|tbenians,</HI>
he drew them out, and &s;ent them home;
but di&s;mi&s;s'd them with &s;uch Marks of Civility, as
&s;hew'd, that he avoided coming to an open Rupture
with that State, at lea&s;t till his De&s;igns were more
ripe for it, tho' at the &s;ame time he did what he
could to weaken them, and drive them out of his
Neighbourhood.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pydna and Potidaea,</NOTE> <HI>Pydna,</HI> with the Territory be|longing
to it, he gave up to the <HI>Olynthians,</HI> who
were his Father's inverterate Enemies. His Hands
were too full at this time to revive the Quarrel
again&s;t &s;o rich and powerful a City, whcih, for
three Years together, had with&s;tood the united
Forces of <HI>Sparta</HI> and <HI>Macedonia;</HI> he therefore
cho&s;e to buy their Friend&s;hip for the pre&s;ent, and
to amu&s;e them by the Delivery of this Town, as
he had done the <HI>Athenians</HI> by the Peace, till he
could attack them at more Advantage. In this
Step al&s;o he over-reach'd the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who were
at the &s;ame time courting the Alliance of the
<HI>Olynthians,</HI> in order to maintain their &s;ooting in
tho&s;e Parts. Which Side &s;oever the <HI>Olynthians</HI>
inclin'd to, they were &s;trong enough to turn
the Balance; and therefore the gaining them
became a Matter of great Contention between
<HI>Philip</HI> and the <HI>Athenians.</HI></P>
<P>The next Place he took,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Creni|dae, which be called Philippi.</NOTE> was <HI>Crenidae,</HI> which
he enlarg'd, and call'd, after his own Name,
<PB N="220" REF="246">
<HI>Philippi,</HI> and which afterwards was famous for
the defeat of <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius.</HI> There were
near this Town &s;ome gold Mines, which he
work'd, and drew out of them an immen&s;e
Trea&s;ure. The yearly Produce of them amount|ed
to a thou&s;and Talents; which was reckon'd
at that time con&s;iderably more than the Re|venue
of <HI>Athens;</HI> and yet that was thought
the riche&s;t State in <HI>Greece.</HI> This was a very
lucky Di&s;covery for one, who knew the Va|lue
and U&s;e of Mony &s;o well as he did. He
was by this means enabled to keep up a good
Body of mercenary Troops at home, with a
great Number of Spies and Pen&s;ioners abroad;
and it was to this Fund, that he ow'd a great
Part of the Succe&s;&s;es of his Reign.</P>
<P><HI>Philip,</HI> in this Progre&s;s of his Affairs, met
with little Oppo&s;ition from the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who
had enough to do to &s;upport their Juri&s;diction
in other Parts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Factions in Eubaea compos'd by the Athe|nians.</NOTE> <HI>Euboea</HI> being at this time di|vided
into Factions, one Party had recour&s;e to
them, and the other to the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who by this
means got footing in the I&s;land. But the <HI>A|thenians</HI>
thought it of too great Importance
to them to be given up: For, be&s;ides
other Advantages, they had formerly drawn a
large Revenue from it. However they did not
exert them&s;elves &s;o vigorou&s;ly as the Ca&s;e re|quir'd,
'till they were &s;pirited up by <HI>Timotheus.
What?</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>The</HI> Thebans <HI>in</HI> Eubaea, <HI>and
you &s;till here! They are in Action, and you are
<PB N="221" REF="247">
deliberating. You have not &s;pread the Seas with
your Shipping; you are not running down to the</HI>
Piraeus; <HI>you are not under Sail.</HI> This Manner
of haranguing had the Effect he propos'd: In
five Days time they made the nece&s;&s;ary Prepa|rations,
and put to Sea; forc'd the <HI>Thebans</HI>
off the I&s;land; compos'd the Differences of the
Inhabitants, and brought them again under their
Dependence. <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> takes particular no|tice
of this Speech of <HI>Timotheus,</HI> and quotes this
Part of it, as an Incentive to the <HI>Athenians</HI>
upon a like Occa&s;ion, when <HI>Philip</HI> was over|running
their Dominions in <HI>Thrace.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Athenians</HI> had no &s;ooner put an end to
the&s;e Di&s;turbances, but <HI>Byzantium,</HI> with the
I&s;lands of <HI>Chios, Cos</HI> and <HI>Rhodes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Social War.</NOTE> revolted, and
confederated again&s;t them, and from thence
gave ri&s;e to that which was call'd <HI>The War of the
Allies,</HI> or <HI>The Social War.</HI> They forthwith &s;ent out
<HI>Chares</HI> and <HI>Chabrias,</HI> with Men and Shipping, to
reduce them. Their fir&s;t Attempt was upon
<HI>Chios;</HI> where <HI>Chabrias,</HI> who commanded at Sea,
forc'd his Entrance into the Harbour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt upon <HI>Chi|os.</HI></NOTE> but being
de&s;erted by the re&s;t of the Fleet, which put
back to Sea, he was immediately &s;urrounded
by the Enemy, who beat upon him on all
&s;ides 'till his Ship was quite di&s;abled, and pierc'd
through with the Enemies Beaks. Whereupon
the Men on board leap'd into the Sea to &s;ave
them&s;elves by &s;wimming: But he not thinking
<PB N="222" REF="248">
it con&s;i&s;tent with his Honour and the Duty
of his Po&s;t, to quit his Ship, &s;tood ob&s;tinately
in the Defence of it, 'till he was mortally
wounded.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chabrias kill'd:</NOTE> <HI>Nepos</HI> &s;ays, contrary to the general
Account of this Expedition, that he &s;erved in
it only as a private Man; which, if it were
&s;o, would be the be&s;t Excu&s;e that could be
made for his Conduct in it: For con&s;idering
him as a Commander,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha|racter.</NOTE> it was certainly too un|concerted,
and too ra&s;h and de&s;perate an Enter|pri&s;e
to be ju&s;tified. But it was agreeable to
a Maxim of his own, <HI>That an Army of Stags
led by a Lion, was more formidable than an Ar|my
of Lions led by a Stag.</HI> He had another
Maxim, which &s;hew'd more Prudence and Cir|cum&s;pection,
<HI>That He was the be&s;t Commander,
who knew be&s;t what his Enemies were doing.</HI>
However, the Spirit he &s;hew'd upon this Oc|ca&s;ion,
with the many other In&s;tances of his
Bravery and Zeal for the Service of his Coun|try,
may be &s;ufficient to rank him with the
Patriots of the be&s;t Ages of <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chares,</HI> with the Land-Forces, had made
&s;ome &s;light Attacks upon the I&s;land; but upon
the Death of his Colleague he drew them off,
and put an end to the Campaign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 105. 4.</NOTE> But the
next Year great Preparations were made on both
Sides for pro&s;ecuting the War with Vigour.
And the Allies having got together a Fleet
of an hundred Sail, hara&s;s'd and plunder'd &s;e|veral
of the I&s;lands under the Dominion of
<PB N="223" REF="249">
<HI>Athens,</HI> and then be&s;ieg'd <HI>Samos.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Samos be|&s;ieg'd by the Allies.</NOTE> The <HI>Atheni|ans</HI>
&s;ent out <HI>Chares</HI> again with &s;ixty Gallies,
and then reinforc'd them with &s;ixty more un|der

who were join'd in Commi&s;&s;ion with him.
They united their Forces, and agreed to be|&s;iege
<HI>Byzantium;</HI> which drew the Allies from
Samos to relieve it. Hereupon the two Fleets
met in the <HI>Helle&s;pont:</HI> But ju&s;t as they were
ready to engage, there happen'd a violent Storm;
notwith&s;tanding which, <HI>Chares</HI> propos'd to pro|ceed
and join Battle, but could not prevail
with his Colleagues to come into it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chares ac|cu&s;es his Colleagues of Treache|ry</NOTE>, whereupon
he wrote to <HI>Athens</HI> to accu&s;e them of Trea|chery;
and they were recall'd, and order'd to

<P><HI>Chares</HI> was now at liberty to act without
Controul; but in&s;tead of pur&s;uing his De&s;igns
again&s;t the I&s;landers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and goes into Foreign Service.</NOTE> he went over to <HI>Artaba|zus</HI>
the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Governor of &s;ome of the Pro|vinces
of <HI>A&s;ia minor,</HI> who had revolted from his
Ma&s;ter, and was reduced almo&s;t to the la&s;t
Extremity by an Army of &s;eventy thou&s;and
Men which was &s;ent out again&s;t him. <HI>Chares,</HI>
upon a Promi&s;e of being well rewarded, enga|ged
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; and having accordingly join'd
their Forces, they de&s;eated the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> But
the King was &s;o incens'd at it, that he threat|en'd
to fit out a Fleet of three hundred Sail
to &s;upport the I&s;landers in their War with the
<HI>Athenians;</HI> which &s;o intimidated them, that they
<PB N="224" REF="250">
clapt up a Peace with the Allies upon their
own Terms;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 106. 1. A Peace with the Allies.</NOTE> which were, <HI>That for the future

put an end to the <HI>Social War,</HI> which had con|tinued
three Years, tho' with very little Action
on either Side, at lea&s;t not &s;uitable to the Pre|parations
that were made for it.</P>
<P>The News of this Expedition of <HI>Chares</HI> was
at fir&s;t very well receiv'd by the Government
of <HI>Athens,</HI> in regard the Troops which were
employ'd in it, were paid by <HI>Artabazus;</HI> and
that indeed was the only pretence that could
be made for undertaking it: But when they
found in what manner the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King re|&s;ented
it, they made it a Charge of Trea&s;on
again&s;t <HI>Chares</HI> for having exceeded his Com|mi&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chares ac|cus'd, but acquitted.</NOTE> and de&s;erted the Service of his Coun|try.
However he found means to &s;ecure a
Party among the People, who brought him
off.</P>
<P><HI>Iphicrates</HI> and <HI>Timotheus</HI> were more hardly
dealt with,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iphicrates and Ti|motheus tried.</NOTE> and for that which had much le&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
the Appearance of a Crime, in refu&s;ing to
join with him in ru&s;hing headlong upon the
Enemy in a Storm, and combating the Ele|ments.
But this Matter was &s;o aggravated by
<HI>Chares,</HI> that they underwent a formal Trial
for it, and, be&s;ides the revoking their Com|mi&s;&s;ions,
had an heavy Fine impos'd on them.
This is the Account <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> gives of
it: But the Fact is by others related differently,
<PB N="225" REF="251">
and with more remarkable Circum&s;tances;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Timothe|us fined.</NOTE> That
<HI>Timotheus</HI> was fined an hundred Talents; which
being unable to pay, he withdrew him&s;elf to
<HI>Chalcis,</HI> where he died. The People &s;oon after
repenting of their U&s;age of him, (as it was
generally the Ca&s;e with them, when it was too
late) remitted nine Parts of the Fine, but ex|acted
the other ten Talents of his Son <HI>Conon</HI>
towards the Repair of their Walls. It was an
odd Circum&s;tance, and a Reproach to <HI>Athens,</HI>
that tho&s;e Walls, which had been rebuilt by
<HI>Conon</HI> the Grandfather, out of the Spoils l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e had
taken from the Enemy, &s;hould now be re|pair'd
by a Fine unju&s;tly rais'd upon <HI>Conon</HI> the
Grand&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Iphicrates</HI> apprehending the &s;ame Fate with
<HI>Timotheus,</HI> had introduced a Number of young
Men into the Court, arm'd with Daggers,
which they every now and then, in the cour&s;e
of the Trial, took care to expo&s;e to the View
of his Judges, in order to intimidate them.
This Menace had the Effect he propos'd, and
accordingly he was acquitted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hicrates acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tted.</NOTE> Being after|wards
reproach'd with &s;o violent a Proceeding,
he &s;aid, <HI>It would have been a Madne&s;s in him,
if, after having &s;ucceeded in War for his Fel|low-Citizens,
he &s;hould not have endeavour'd to
do the &s;ame for him&s;elf.</HI> And certainly, what|ever
In&s;ult it was upon the publick Ju&s;tice, it
was owing to the People them&s;elves, who, by
their capricious, jealous and ungrate&s;ul Behavi|our
<PB N="226" REF="252">
towards their Generals, had forc'd them to
the&s;e Extremities. For whatever their Conduct
were, they never knew when they were &s;afe. They
were no longer regarded, than they were want|ed;
and when their Service was over, it was
approv'd or cen&s;ur'd, according as the Faction
for or again&s;t them prevail'd: In &s;hort they
lay at the Mercy of every little de&s;igning <HI>De|magogue,</HI>
who had Art enough to inflame the
Multitude. Under the&s;e Di&s;couragements, it is
not to be wonder'd at, that many of them
engag'd them&s;elves in Foreign Service, or went
into a voluntary Exile; in&s;omuch that there
were &s;carce any left to command at home.
This is to be look'd upon as one principal
Cau&s;e of the Decay of the Power of <HI>Athens,</HI>
which began now too vi&s;ibly to appear. <HI>Ne|pos</HI>
&s;eems to fix it to this Period of Time, and
ob&s;erves, that <HI>Chabrias, Iphicrates</HI> and <HI>Timo|theus</HI>
were the la&s;t of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Captains.
However, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, there were &s;eve|ral
con&s;iderable Men after them, who occa&s;io|nally
&s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves in the Defence, or
other nece&s;&s;ary Service of their Country: But
it is certain, there was not any Number, or
regular Succe&s;&s;ion of &s;uch, as were able to keep
up the ancient Spirit and Di&s;cipline of the
Troops, or the Grandeur of the Common|wealth.</P>
<P>As
to <HI>Iphicrates,</HI> whether, after his Trial, he
declined the Service, or was laid a&s;ide by the
<PB N="227" REF="253">
State, we hear no more of his being employ'd
either at home, or abroad; and yet he is &s;aid
to have liv'd to a good old Age. However
<HI>Diodorus</HI> &s;ays, he was dead, when the great
Battle of <HI>Cehron&ecirc;a</HI> was fought in the hundred
and tenth <HI>Olympiad,</HI> but without mentioning
the Time and Circum&s;tances of his Death;
and therefore we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that
he &s;pent the Remainder of his Days in &s;ome
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">b&s;cure Retirement.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Iphicra|tes.</NOTE> But whatever became of
him, he was at this time a great Lo&s;s to the
Publick. He had &s;erved on many Occa&s;ions,
and generally with Succe&s;s; which was chiefly
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">wing to his Skill and Prudence; and his Ser|vice
had been very u&s;eful and &s;ea&s;onable. He
was not &s;o much noted for the Fame of his
Exploits, as for his Art and Improvements in
the military Di&s;cipline, wherein he was very
exact, and withal &s;evere. He was always up|on
his Guard, and left as little room for Ac|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">idents
as po&s;&s;ible. To this purpo&s;e, when one
ask'd him, why he fortify'd his Camp, which
he had pitch'd in a Country belonging to his
Confederates, he replied, <HI>The wor&s;t Speech a
General can make, is, I did not think.</HI> His Men
were &s;o perfect in their Exerci&s;e, and &s;o obe|dient

given to engage, they knew their Bu&s;ine&s;s,
and did it of them&s;elves, as if every private
Man had been directed by the able&s;t O&s;&s;icer.
This was particularly experienc'd in the War
<PB N="228" REF="254">
at <HI>Corinth,</HI> where he put a &s;top to the Pro|gre&s;s

who were a&s;&s;embled, as the <HI>States
General</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> for that purpo&s;e; and an
heavy Fine was impos'd on them: Which be|ing
unable to pay, they refus'd to &s;ubmit to
the Sentence, alledging, that the Care and Pa|tronage
of the Temple belong'd anciently to
them, and they quoted an Authority for it from
<HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>This Spirit of Oppo&s;ition was rais'd by <HI>Phi|lomelus</HI>
a principal Man among them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philome|lus the Phocian General.</NOTE> who en|courag'd
them to take up Arms, and acted as
their General. He fir&s;t applied him&s;elf to the
<HI>Spartans,</HI> who had likewi&s;e been fined by the

the <HI>Cadm&ecirc;a.</HI> For this rea&s;on they were very
well di&s;pos'd to join with him, but did not
yet think it proper to declare them&s;elves:
However they encourag'd his De&s;ign, and &s;up|plied
him under-hand with Mony; by which
means he rais'd Troops, and, without much
Difficulty, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Temple. The
chief Re&s;i&s;tance he met with in the Neighbour|hood,

was from the <HI>Locrians;</HI> but having wor&s;ted
them, he era&s;ed the Decree of the <HI>Amphictyons,</HI>
which was in&s;crib'd on the Pillars of the Temple.
However, to &s;trengthen his Authority, and give
a Colour to his Proceedings, he thought it con|venient
to con&s;ult the Oracle, and to procure an
An&s;wer in his Favour: But when he applied to
the Prie&s;te&s;s for that Purpo&s;e, &s;he refus'd to offi|ciate,

told him, <HI>The God left him at Liberty to act as

and as &s;uch, he took care to divulge it.</P>
<P>This occa&s;ion'd another A&s;&s;embly of the <HI>Am|phictyons,</HI>
the Re&s;ult whereof was a formal De|charation
of War again&s;t the <HI>Phocians.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Greece di|vided in this War.</NOTE> And the

had made great Profe&s;&s;ions with regard to the
Riches of the Temple, which were immen&s;e, that
he would not touch any Part thereof, and that
he had no De&s;ign in making him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of

encreas'd the Pay of his Men, and by that En|couragement
got together a con&s;iderable Army

&s;o well, that if his Cau&s;e had been better,

as a bold and wicked Adventurer, who &s;tood in

<P>The&s;e were the Tran&s;actions of the two fir&s;t

the Remains of the Army, and recruited it. For

in the Affairs of the Publick, that a particular
Account of him, be&s;ides the doing Ju&s;tice to the
Character of &s;o wonderful a Man, may &s;erve, in
a great mea&s;ure, to explain and illu&s;trate the Hi&s;|tory
of the Times he liv'd in. The chief Re|gard
that has been paid to his Memory, has
generally been on account of his Eloquence. But
he was likewi&s;e a very able State&s;man, and a good
Patriot; and con&s;idering the Emba&s;&s;ies and Ex|peditions,
the Treaties and Alliances, and other
various Negotiations wherein he was employ'd
together with the Zeal and Integrity with which
he acted in them, it may be que&s;tion'd whether
he did not excel as much in tho&s;e Capacities, a
<PB N="241" REF="267">
in that of an Orator; tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd,
that his Art of Speaking was the Foundation of
his other Merit, or at lea&s;t the Means of pro|ducing
it to Advantage, and improving it. But
notwith&s;tanding that he arriv'd to &s;uch a Per|fection
in this Art, he &s;et out under great Di&s;|advantages:
For he had an Impediment in his
Speech, with a weak Voice, and a &s;hort Breath,
and a very uncouth and ungracious Manner;
however by Dint of Re&s;olution, and infinite
Pains, he overcame all the&s;e Defects. He
would climb up &s;teep and craggy Places to help
his Wind, and &s;trengthen his Voice; he would
declaim with Pebbles in his Mouth, to remedy
the Imperfection in his Speech; he would place
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Looking-Gla&s;s before him, to correct the
Aukwardne&s;s of his Ge&s;ture; and he learn'd of
the be&s;t Players the proper Graces of Action and
Pronunciation, which he thought of &s;o much
Con&s;equence, that he made the whole Art of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ratory in a manner to con&s;i&s;t of them. But
whatever Stre&s;s he laid upon the exterior Part of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">peaking; he was al&s;o very careful about the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">atter, and the Stile; the latter of which he
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">orm'd upon the Model of <HI>Thucydides,</HI> who&s;e
Hi&s;tory, for that Purpo&s;e, he tran&s;crib'd eight &s;e|eral
times. He was &s;o intent upon his Study,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">at he would often retire in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o a Cave of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">arth, and &s;have half his Head, &s;o that he could
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ot with Decency appear abroad, 'till his Hair
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s grown again. He al&s;o accu&s;tom'd him&s;elf
<PB N="242" REF="268">
to harangue at the Sea Shore, where the Agita
tion of the Waves form'd to him an Idea of the
Commotions in a popular A&s;&s;embly, and &s;erv'd
to prepare and fortify him again&s;t them.</P>
<P>From the&s;e &s;everal Kinds of Hard&s;hip, which
he impos'd upon him&s;elf, it is plain that he was not
born an Orator, but was rather an In&s;tance how
far Parts and Application may go, towards the
forming a great Man in any Profe&s;&s;ion. To
add to which, he had a great deal of Ambition
to &s;pur him on; and that which heighten'd it
or rather gave the fir&s;t Ri&s;e to it, was a famous
Cau&s;e in a Matter of Di&s;pute concerning <HI>Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
pus,</HI> whether that City belong'd to the <HI>Attick</HI> of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
the <HI>Theban</HI> Frontier. <HI>Calli&s;tratus,</HI> who pleaded
in Behalf of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> &s;ucceeded well, and
receiv'd extraordinary Applau&s;e; which &s;o af
fected <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> that from that In&s;tant, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
he was then but &s;ixteen Years old, he fix'd hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Re&s;olution, and turn'd his Thoughts wholly th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
way. And indeed the Study of Oratory was a
that Time the readie&s;t, and almo&s;t the only
Means of ri&s;ing in the State. His fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay
at the Bar, was two Years after this Incident
when he call'd his Guardians to account for im
bezzling his Patrimony, and recover'd &s;ome Par
of it. This encourag'd him &s;ome time after a
harangue before the People in their publick A&s;&s;em
bly; but he acquitted him&s;elf &s;o ill, that they
hi&s;s'd him. However he ventur'd a &s;econd time
but with no better Succe&s;s than before; &s;o th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="243" REF="269">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he went away a&s;hamed and confounded, and
quite in De&s;pair. It was upon this Occa&s;ion that
<HI>Satyrus</HI> the Player acco&s;ted him, and in a friendly
way encourag'd him to proceed. With this
View, he ask'd him to repeat to him &s;ome
Ver&s;es of <HI>Sophocles or Euripides,</HI> which he ac|cordingly
did; the other repeated them after
him, but with &s;uch a different Spirit and Ca|dence,
as made him &s;en&s;ible, that he knew very
little of Elocution. But by his In&s;tructions, and
his own Per&s;everance, he at length made him&s;elf
ma&s;ter of it; and by the Methods before-men|tion'd,
he corrected the Imperfections which
were born with him, as well as the ill Habits
which he had contracted. It is not very clear,
wheter this Pa&s;&s;age be rightly a&s;crib'd to <HI>Saty|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us,</HI>
who &s;eems to be confounded with <HI>Neoptole|mus</HI>
and <HI>Andronicus,</HI> who were likewi&s;e famous
Comedians; and <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> is &s;aid to have been
in&s;tructed by all three of them.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Advantages and Improvements, he
appear'd again in publick, and &s;ucceeded &s;o well,
that People flock'd from all Parts of <HI>Greece</HI> to
hear him. From hence he was look'd upon as
the Standard of true Eloquence; in&s;omuch that
none of his Countrymen have been put in Com|pari&s;on
with him; nor even among the <HI>Romans,</HI>
any but <HI>Cicero:</HI> And tho' it has been made a
Que&s;tion by the ancient Writers, to which of
the two they &s;hould give the Preference, they
have not ventur'd to decide it, but have contented
<PB N="244" REF="270">
them&s;elves with de&s;cribing their different Beauties
and &s;hewing that they were both perfect in their
kind. But to confine my&s;elf to <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> hi
kind of Eloquence was grave and au&s;tere, lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
his Temper, but withal ma&s;culine and &s;ublime
bold, forcible and impetuous; abounding with
Metaphors, Apo&s;trophes, and Interrogations
which, with his &s;olemn way of invoking and ap|pealing
to the Gods, the Planets, the Elements,
and the <HI>Manes</HI> of tho&s;e who &s;ell at <HI>Salamis</HI> and
<HI>Marathon,</HI> had &s;uch a wonderful Effect upon his
Hearers, that they thought him in&s;pir'd. If he
had not &s;o much Softne&s;s and In&s;inuation, as is
often requi&s;ite in an Orator, it was not that he
wanted Art and Delicacy, when the Cafe requir'd
it; he knew how to found the Inclinations of the
People, and to lead them to the Point he aim'd
at, and &s;ometimes by &s;eeming to propo&s;e that
which was directly contrary to it. But his chief
Characteri&s;tick was Vehemence, both in the Ac|tion
and Expre&s;&s;ion; and indeed that was the
Qualification of all others mo&s;t wanted at this
time. For the People were grown &s;o in&s;olent
and imperious, &s;o factious and divided, &s;o jealous
of the Power of the <HI>Democracy,</HI> and withal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">n k into a State of Plea&s;ure and Indolence, that
no Arts of Per&s;ua&s;ion would have been &s;o effectual.
as that Spirit and Re&s;olution, that Force and E|nergy
of <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> to humble them, to unite
them, and to rou&s;e them into a Sen&s;e of their
common Danger.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="271">
But neither could <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> him&s;elf have
made &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions on them, if his Talent of
&s;peaking had not been &s;upported by their Opi|nion
of his Integrity. It was that which added
Weight and Empha&s;is to every thing he &s;aid,
and animated the Whole. It was that which
chiefly engag'd their Attention, and determin'd
their Coun&s;els, when they were convinc'd that he
&s;poke from his Heart, and had no Intere&s;t to
manage, but that of the Community. And this
he gave the &s;tronge&s;t Proofs of in his Zeal a|gain&s;t
<HI>Philip,</HI> who &s;aid, <HI>He was of more Weight
again&s;t him, than all the Fleets and Armies of the</HI>
Athenians; and that <HI>he had no Enemy but</HI> De|mo&s;thenes.
He was not wanting in his Endea|vours
to corrupt him, as he had mo&s;t of the leading
Men in <HI>Greece;</HI> but he with&s;tood all his Offers,
and <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;ays, <HI>all the Gold of</HI> Macedonia <HI>could
not bribe him.</HI> And yet as inflexible as he was to
<HI>Philip,</HI> he became more pliable in the Reign of
his Succe&s;&s;or, and gave occa&s;ion to his Enemies
to accu&s;e him of Bribery; for which he was
fin'd and impri&s;on'd, and afterwards bani&s;h'd.
This Charge again&s;t him has by &s;ome been
thought a malicious and groundle&s;s Calumny,
and the rather, becau&s;e he was not allow'd to
ju&s;tify him&s;elf. But the Fact is &s;o generally
related by others, and with &s;o many Circum|&s;tances,
that it is not ea&s;ily to be re&s;uted. The
Ca&s;e in &s;hort was, That <HI>Harpalus,</HI> an Officer of
<HI>Allexander's,</HI> having imbezzled a great Part of
<PB N="246" REF="272">
the Trea&s;ure that he had been entru&s;ted with,
made up a Pur&s;e, and retir'd with it to <HI>Athens</HI>
for Protection. It was debated by the People,
whether they &s;hould admit him, for fear of in|curring
his Ma&s;ter's Di&s;plea&s;ure, and involving
them&s;elves in a War; and <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> con&s;ider|ing
it in that Light, oppos'd it. <HI>Harpalus,</HI> to
remove all Difficulties, di&s;pers'd his Mony pretty
liberally among the Orators; and as he was di&s;|playing
his Wealth, <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> happen'd to fix
his Eyes on a rich Gold Cup of the King's,
and admiring the Sculpture and Fa&s;hion, ask'd
the Price of it. <HI>Harpalus</HI> took the Hint, and
at Night &s;ent it home to him, together with
twenty Talents in Mony. The next Day he
appear'd in the A&s;&s;embly muffled up about his
Throat; and when he was expected to &s;peak to
the Point in Que&s;tion, he made Signs that he
had lo&s;t his Voice. But his Tran&s;action with
<HI>Harpalus</HI> had taken Wind; and when he found
him&s;elf detected, he ro&s;e up to excu&s;e it; but
the People were &s;o enrag'd, that they would not
hear him: Whereupon a certain Wag &s;tood up
and &s;aid, <HI>What, will ye not hear the King's Cup|bearer?</HI>
Others &s;aid, <HI>Surely, the Orator had not
been &s;eiz'd that Night with a Silver Squinzy;</HI> and
they had coin'd a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> Word on purpo&s;e to expre&s;s
it. <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> could not &s;tand this Contempt
and Raillery of his Fellow-Citizens, who had
hitherto e&s;teem'd and re&s;pected him, even to a
Sort of Reverence; and it affected him the more,
<PB N="247" REF="273">
becau&s;e he had piqu'd him&s;elf &s;o much more
than others upon the Rigidne&s;s of his Virtue,
which indeed was the chief Foundation of that
extraordinary Re&s;pect which had been paid him.
But the Itch of Mony had infected him; and
this was not the only in&s;tance of his receiving
Pre&s;ents in a clande&s;tine and unwarrantable man|ner.
As a further Argument that he did not
de&s;pi&s;e Mony, he was reproach'd with dealing
in Bottomry, which in tho&s;e Days was look'd
upon as a &s;candalous way of Traffick: And
therefore <HI>Zeno,</HI> who likewi&s;e practis'd it &s;ome
time after him, gave it up as a thing that would
hurt the Credit of his Philo&s;ophy. But however
<HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> was in &s;ome Degree tainted with the
general Corruption of the Times, he does not
&s;eem to have lov'd Mony &s;o much for its own
Sake, as to &s;erve the Ends of his Ambition:
Wherein he copied after <HI>Pericles,</HI> whom he like|wi&s;e
cho&s;e to imitate in his manner of &s;peaking.
He had not the Command as the other had of
the publick Mony, and therefore was not in a
Capacity of doing &s;o many great and popular
Acts: But he repair'd the City Walls, &s;itted out
Ships, ran&s;om'd Slaves, married poor Maidens,
entertain'd the People with Shews and Sports,
and did &s;uch other things of that kind, as were
within the Compa&s;s of his private Fortune. And
this &s;eems the mo&s;t plau&s;ible way of accounting
for the Methods he took to get Mony, and to
improve it.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="274">
But whatever might be alledg'd in his Excu&s;e
as to Mony Matters, he had another Failing,
which, by his own confe&s;&s;ion, he was guilty
of, and that was want of Courage, as will be
more particularly related in its proper Place. In
the mean time, I would only ob&s;erve the &s;trange
Incon&s;i&s;tency in the Compo&s;ition of this Great
Man, who, with &s;uch Con&s;tancy and Intrepidity,
oppos'd all the Mea&s;ures of the Foreign and
Dome&s;tick Enemies of his Country, and who &s;o
often, at the Hazard of his Life, brav'd the
Madne&s;s of the People in their A&s;&s;emblies, and
yet could not &s;tand an Enemy in the Field. <HI>He
cho&s;e,</HI> &s;ays Plutarch, <HI>to &s;wear by tho&s;e who fell at</HI>
Maratnon, <HI>tho' he could not follow their Example.</HI>
And what is &s;till more extraordinary, he after|wards
refus'd Life when it was offer'd him; and
Nobody died with greater Fortitude. The&s;e
Frailties which I have mention'd, could not but
take off a great deal from the Lu&s;tre of his Cha|acter;
in&s;omuch that <HI>Phocion,</HI> who &s;ucceeded
him, tho' in &s;everal Re&s;pects he was not equal
to him, be&s;ides that he was &s;u&s;pected to favour
the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Intere&s;t, yet being more re|markable
for his per&s;onal Ju&s;tice and Valour, he
was therefore look'd upon as the greater Man.
However <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> &s;uch as he was, did more
Service to the State than any of his Contempo|raries:
He was the chief Bulwark, not only of
<HI>Athens,</HI> but of <HI>Greece</HI> in general, and almo&s;t
the only Ob&s;tacle to <HI>Philip's</HI> De&s;igns of en&s;laving
<PB N="249" REF="275">
it. Which leads us now into an Enquiry how
tho&s;e De&s;igns were laid, and how far they &s;uc|ceeded.</P>
<P>The
two next Years of the <HI>Phocian</HI> War pa&s;s'd
without any memorable Action, tho' it was &s;till
continu'd by Skirmi&s;hes and mutual Depreda|tions.
<HI>Philip</HI> had now no Part in it. But when
he found him&s;elf &s;hut out of <HI>Greece</HI> by the
<HI>Athenians,</HI> he turn'd his Arms again&s;t tho&s;e re|mote
Places, which depended on them, either as
Colonies, or as Conque&s;ts: and particularly a|gain&s;t
the <HI>Olynthians,</HI> whom he had long look'd
upon with an evil Eye, but had courted and ca|joled
them whil&s;t he was otherwi&s;e employ'd.
But he came now re&s;olv'd entirely to reduce 'em;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 108. 1. Philip's De&s;ign upon Olynthus.</NOTE> 
and advancing towards the City, only &s;ent them
a &s;hort Me&s;&s;age, to let them know, <HI>That one of
the&s;e two Points was become nece&s;&s;ary, either that
they mu&s;t quit</HI> Olynthus, <HI>or he</HI> Macedonia: Where|upon
they &s;ent immediately to <HI>Athens</HI> for Relief.
The Matter was debated there with great Solem|nity;
and <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> was very earne&s;t in &s;up|porting
their Demand:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Demo&s;the|nes pre&s;&s;es the Athe|nians to re|lieve it:</NOTE> In the doing whereof,
he took occa&s;ion to lay open the De&s;igns and
Practices of <HI>Philip,</HI> inveighing again&s;t him with
great Bitterne&s;s, and urging every thing that
might &s;erve to incen&s;e the People again&s;t him.
He de&s;crib'd him as a proud tyrannical U&s;ur|per,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;ertbes Philip.</NOTE> and a common Di&s;turber of Mankind;
without Faith or Confidence; without any Prin|ciple
of Honour or Ju&s;tice, or any Regard to
<PB N="250" REF="276">
Laws, Human or Divine. Then as to the Dan|ger
they might apprehend from him, he repre|&s;ented
him likewi&s;e as politick, vigilant, inde|fatigable,
intrepid and fortunate, who fought as
&s;ucce&s;sfully with his Mony as his Sword, and
knew how to corrupt where he could not con|quer.
But le&s;t, from this Account of him, he
&s;hould appear &s;o formidable to the People, that
they might be di&s;courag'd from endeavouring to
&s;top his Progre&s;s, he &s;hew'd him in another
Light, as vain, pre&s;umptuous, ra&s;h and impru|dent,
forming Schemes without any Founda|tion;
and mea&s;uring the Va&s;tne&s;s of his De&s;igns
only by the Standard of his Ambition. From
the&s;e different Views of him, which were varied
according to the different Impre&s;&s;ions that were
to be made upon the People, we may collect al|mo&s;t
the whole of his Character: But the Orator,
in framing this Picture of him, mu&s;t be &s;aid to
have drawn the Lines a little too &s;trong, and to
have heighten'd the Colours too much by the
Warmth of his Zeal, and the Force of his Elo|cution.
And yet the&s;e Exaggerations were ne|ce&s;&s;ary
at this Time, in order to inflame the
People: For <HI>Philip</HI> had his Partizans among the
Orators, who combated and oppos'd every thing
that was urg'd again&s;t him.</P>
<P>One of the able&s;t and mo&s;t zealous of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Dema|des.</NOTE> 
was <HI>Demades,</HI> who was very ready and acute,
and remarkable for &s;peaking <HI>extempore,</HI> as any
Occa&s;ion offer'd. Herein he had manife&s;tly the
<PB N="251" REF="277">
Advantage of <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> who&s;e Works were
&s;aid <HI>to &s;mell of the Lamp.</HI> And hence it was,
that <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> being ask'd his Opinion of the
two Orators, an&s;wer'd, <HI>That</HI> Demo&s;thenes <HI>was
worthy of the City of</HI> Athens; <HI>but that</HI> Dema|des
<HI>was above it.</HI> However <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> had,
upon &s;ome very important Occa&s;ions, &s;ucceed|ed
well in the unpremeditated way of haran|guing;
but it being not his u&s;ual Method, nor
his natural Talent, he di&s;couraged the Practice
of it. And therein he made u&s;e of an artful
Argument, That to &s;peak before the People
in an abrupt manner, and without due Prepa|ration,
was not treating them with Re&s;pect;
that it had &s;omewhat of an <HI>Oligarchical</HI> Prin|ciple
in it, and was rather bearing them down by
Force, than winning them by Per&s;ua&s;ion. As
to <HI>Demades,</HI> whatever his Wit and Parts were,
he was very mercenary and corrupt: And when
he was charg'd with it, he &s;aid, <HI>He had often
&s;poke again&s;t him&s;elf, but never again&s;t his Coun|try.</HI>
But there is an In&s;tance recorded of him,
wherein he &s;eem'd rather to value him&s;elf up|on
it, than to excu&s;e it: For meeting one day with
a Player, who had receiv'd a Talent as a Reward
for a Part that he had excell'd in, <HI>It is not &s;o
extraodinary,</HI> &s;aid Demades, <HI>to have one Talent
given you for &s;peaking; I had Ten given me for hold|ing
my Tongue.</HI> His pro&s;tituting him&s;elf in this
manner, was chiefly to &s;upport his Luxury: For
he was naturally profu&s;e and gluttonous; and
<PB N="252" REF="278">
hence it was, that when he was grown
old, <HI>Antipater</HI> compar'd him to a &s;acrificed
Bea&s;t, of which all the Parts were con&s;um'd,
but the Tongue and the Paunch. He was &s;ome|times
upon good Terms with <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> ac|cording
as it &s;erv'd his pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e: but
the Rivai&s;hip in their Profe&s;&s;ion, with the dif|ferent
Ca&s;t of their Tempers and their Poli|ticks,
made it impracticable for them to live
in any real Friend&s;hip. On the contrary, they
were generally at Variance; and at length it
came to an open Enmity, which in the Sequel
will appear to have co&s;t <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> his L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e.</P>
<P>Another of the &s;ame Stamp with <HI>Demades,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">and of Hyperi|des.</NOTE> 
was <HI>Hyperides,</HI> both as to his Parts and Prin|ciples,
and his riotous Manner of living. He
had a more premeditated way of &s;peaking; but
with the &s;ame kind of Wit and Acrimony, tho'
he was not &s;o quick. He is generally rank'd
with <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> and is mention'd as one of
the Ten Principal Orators of that Age, tho'
<HI>Plutarch</HI> does not reckon him in that Number.
He took a great deal of pains to ingratiate
him&s;elf with the People, and had no Ties of
Faith or Friend&s;hip, but as they &s;erv'd that
End. However he was not much in the Ad|mini&s;tration
of Affairs 'till the Reign of <HI>Alex|ander:</HI>
And then he acted &s;uch a double Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
between the Patriot and the Traitor, that he
was at la&s;t en&s;nar'd by his own Politicks, and
&s;ell a Sacrifice to the Re&s;entment of <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">pater</HI>
<PB N="253" REF="279">
Such were mo&s;t of the leading Men in the
A&s;&s;emblies, and &s;uch was generally their End.
To carry on their own private Views, they
inflamed the People, and deluded them with
fal&s;e Colours, 'till they had drawn them either
into an unnece&s;&s;ary War, or a bad Peace: But
&s;ooner or later they &s;uffer'd for it, and were
either made particular Marks of Vengeance, or
involved in the common Ruin of their Coun|try.
This was more remarkably the Ca&s;e at
<HI>Athens,</HI> which had been always look'd upon
as the chief Seat of Eloquence, and never a|bounded
with &s;o many eminent Speakers as at
this time. But that which was the Glory
of this Common-wealth, mu&s;t at the &s;ame time
be con&s;ider'd as one principal Cau&s;e that ha&s;t|en'd
its Downfall, and drew along with it that
of the other <HI>Grecian</HI> States.</P>

Sort complain'd, that the Burthen lay wholly
upon them, and that the Publick Mony was
&s;quander'd away in Shews and Fe&s;tivals, for
the Entertainment of the lower Rank of the
Citizens, who fat at their Ea&s;e, and contribu|ted
nothing to the Support of the Publick,
either in their Pur&s;e, or their Per&s;ons. They
retorted upon the Rich, that they enjoy'd all
the Honours and great Offices of the State,
exclu&s;ive of the common People; and as they
had the Law on their Side, with Numbers to
&s;upport it, they gave little Attention to any
Remon&s;trances that were made upon this Head.
<HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> who had nothing in view but the
General Good, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ound
the People upon this Subject, and enter'd as
far into it as he could with Safety; He pro|pos'd,
that Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be appointed
to in&s;pect the Laws in general, not in order
to make new Ones, for that there were already
too many; but that &s;uch of them, as &s;hould be
&s;ound prejudicial to the Publick, might be a|boli&s;hed.
At the &s;ame time he urg'd the pre|&s;ent
Nece&s;&s;ity of rai&s;ing Forces, and mention|ed
the <HI>Theatrical Mony</HI> as the only proper
Fund for it. In Conclu&s;ion he told them plain|ly,
that the Law relating to it ought to be
repeal'd. However he took care to deliver it
only as his Opinion, without propo&s;ing it in
form, &s;o as to &s;ubject him&s;elf to the Penalty.</P>

in &s;hort, to &s;et Bounds to his Ambition at home,

to <HI>Greece;</HI> and <HI>I&s;ocrates</HI> cho&s;e this way of
gaining upon him by Mildne&s;s and Complai&s;ance;
but he was too ea&s;y and credulous. <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI>
was more a Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and knew the

of his a&s;piring and intriguing Temper, who had,

him&s;elf, would be prevail'd upon by any Rea|&s;oning

which was now &s;o near taking Effect. However
the Sincerity and long Experience of <HI>I&s;ocrates,</HI> who
was now eighty-eight Years old, added great
Weight to his Opinion; which, with the Im|pre&s;&s;ions
that <HI>Ae&s;chines,</HI> and the other Pen&s;ioners
had made upon the People, together with their
own natural Aver&s;ion to War, determin'd the

<P>He did not immediately di&s;cover what u&s;e he
intended to make of his Entrance into <HI>Greece,</HI>
but went on, according to his Agreement with
the <HI>Thebans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3658. Olymp. 108. 3. He puts an End to the Phocian War.</NOTE> to put an End to the <HI>Phocian</HI> War,
which he ea&s;ily effected. His Name and Ap|pearance
&s;truck &s;uch a Terror among the <HI>Pho|cians,</HI>
that tho' they had lately receiv'd a Rein|forcement
of a thou&s;and heavy-arm'd <HI>Spartans,</HI>
under the Command of their King <HI>Archidamus,</HI>
they declin'd giving him Battle, and &s;ent to
treat with him, or rather to &s;ubmit them&s;elves
to any Terms, that he would give them. He
allow'd <HI>Phalecus</HI> to retire with eight thou&s;and
Men, being Mercenaries, into <HI>Peloponne&s;us;</HI> but
the re&s;t, who were the Inhabitants of <HI>Phocis,</HI> were
left at his Mercy. As the di&s;po&s;ing of them was
a Matter wherein <HI>Greece</HI> in general was concern'd,
he did not think fit to act in it by his own pri|vate
Authority, but referr'd it to the <HI>Amphictyons,</HI>
whom he caus'd to be a&s;&s;embled for that Purpo&s;e.
But they were &s;o much under his Influence, that
they &s;erv'd only to give a Sanction to his Deter|minations.
They decreed, <HI>That all the Cities of</HI>
Phocis <HI>&s;hould be demoli&s;h'd; That they who had
fled, as being principally concern'd in the Sacrilege
&s;hould be &s;tigmatiz'd as accurs'd, and pro&s;crib'd a
Out-laws; That they who remain'd as Inhabitants
&s;hould be di&s;pers'd in Villages, and oblig'd to pay

out of their Lands, a yearly Tribute of &s;ixty Ta|lents,
till the Whole of what had been taken out of
the Temple, &s;hould be re&s;tor'd.</HI> They were likewi&s;e
adjudg'd to lo&s;e their Seat in the Council of the
<HI>Amphictyons,</HI> wherein they had a double Voice.
This <HI>Philip</HI> got transferr'd to him&s;elf;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He obtains a Seat a|mong the Amphic|tyons,</NOTE> which
was a very material Point, and may be look'd
upon as the principal Step towards his gaining
that Authority, which he afterwards exercis'd in

gain'd, in Conjunction with the <HI>Thebans</HI> and

<P>Thus did <HI>Philip,</HI> without &s;triking a Stroke,
put an End to this War, after it had for ten
Years together divided <HI>Greece</HI> again&s;t it&s;elf. And
be&s;ides the other Advantages that he had drawn
from it, he gain'd an univer&s;al E&s;teem and Ap|plau&s;e,

<P>About

fell by Degrees into <HI>Ari&s;tocracies,</HI> and were after|wards
erected into little Principalities and Ty|rannies,
under the Command of &s;ingle Per&s;ons.
<PB N="272" REF="298">

of the Di&s;&s;en&s;ions between the Magi&s;|trates

and, under a Pretence of re&s;toring them to their
Dignities, obtain'd the Sovereignty for him&s;elf.
However he made no ill u&s;e of his Power. He
&s;ignaliz'd him&s;elf by many great Actions both in

tempted by the Fruitfulne&s;s of the Soil, and
the Riches of the Inhabitants. Accordingly,
under the common Pretence of a&s;&s;i&s;ting to com|po&s;e

on which, <HI>Timoleon</HI> finding, that neither the

Menaces had any effect upon him, retired at a
little di&s;tance from him, and &s;tood weeping
with his Face cover'd, whil&s;t the other Two
drew their Swords, and di&s;patch'd him. <HI>Dio|dorus
Siculus</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Timoleon</HI> kill'd him with his
own Hands in the Market-place. He relates
this Story with &s;everal other different Circum|&s;tances:
But the Account which <HI>Plutarch</HI> gives
of it from the Hi&s;torians, who liv'd at the
time when the Fact was committed, is more
probable, and more con&s;i&s;tent and uniform, as
well as more to the Honour of <HI>Timoleon.</HI> This
Action was by &s;ome extoll'd and applauded as the
highe&s;t pitch of human Virtue, and by others
condemn'd as a ba&s;e and unnatural Parricide.
And <HI>Timoleon</HI> him&s;elf, when he came to cool,
felt &s;uch a Remor&s;e for it, that he abandon'd
him&s;elf to De&s;pair, and re&s;olv'd to &s;tarve him|&s;elf
to death. His Friends with great Impor|tunity,
and even by Force, prevail'd upon him
to take &s;ome Su&s;tenance; and at length he
promis'd them he would live, but upon con|dition
that he might quit the Service of the
Publick, and retire to &s;ome remote and de&s;art
Corner of the Country; which he accordingly
did, and for near twelve Years together, wan|der'd
up and down the Fields by him&s;elf in
this anxious and &s;orlorn Condition.</P>
<P>He was return'd to <HI>Corinth</HI> when he was
pitch'd upon for this Command; and as he
liv'd &s;till in a retir'd way, he would gladly have
<PB N="278" REF="304">
declin'd it, but that he did not think it con|&s;i&s;tent
with the Duty he ow'd to his Coun|try.
Before he &s;et out, he was told, <HI>That as
to the Affair of his Brother, the World would
judge of it according to his Behaviour in this
Expedition; That if he acquitted him&s;elf well in
it, he would be &s;aid to have freed his Country
from a Tyrant; if otherwi&s;e, he would be look'd
upon as his Brother's Murtherer.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was preparing to embark, there
came Letters from <HI>Icetes</HI> to di&s;&s;uade him from
it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Icetes en|deavours to prevent his landing in Sicily.</NOTE> as a dangerous and fruitle&s;s Attempt; for
that he would be intercepted in his Pa&s;&s;age
by the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> whom, for want of re|ceiving
Succours in due time from <HI>Corinth,</HI>
he had been forced to call in to his A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
again&s;t the Tyrant: Whereupon <HI>Timoleon</HI>
was forthwith order'd away with ten Gallies.</P>
<P>Being arriv'd on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Italy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 108. 4. He arrives on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Italy.</HI></NOTE> he re|ceiv'd
advice, that <HI>Icetes</HI> had made him&s;elf
Ma&s;ter of the greate&s;t Part of <HI>Syracu&s;e;</HI> that
he had forced the Tyrant into the Citadel;
and that the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> had orders to
prevent his landing: And accordingly at <HI>Rhe|gium</HI>
he found twenty Gallies, which had been
detach'd from their Fleet for that purpo&s;e.
They had likewi&s;e Deputies on board from <HI>Ice|tes</HI>
to acquaint him, That the Affairs of <HI>Si|cily</HI>
being in a manner &s;ettled, there would be
no Occa&s;ion for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but how|ever,
that, in ca&s;e he would &s;end home his
<PB N="279" REF="305">
Gallies, with the Troops, he might come up
him&s;elf to <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> and &s;hare with him in his
Conque&s;ts. <HI>Timoleon</HI> had no Views of this kind;
but finding him&s;elf over-power'd, he &s;eem'd to
hearken to their Propo&s;al, and to &s;ubmit to it
as a Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He lands in <HI>Sicily</HI> by a Stra|tagem.</NOTE> However he de&s;ir'd
for Form &s;ake, and in order to ju&s;tify his
Conduct at his Return to <HI>Corinth,</HI> that what
had pa&s;s'd privately between them, might be
declared in a more open manner before the
People of <HI>Rhegium,</HI> as being common Friends
to both Parties. But the leading Men among
them were in his Intere&s;t; and this Demand
of his was a concerted thing between them, as
a Project for his e&s;caping out of their Hands.
To carry on this De&s;ign, an A&s;&s;embly was
call'd, and <HI>Timoleon,</HI> and the Amba&s;&s;adors, to|gether
with the Captains of the <HI>Carthaginian</HI>
Gallies, were admitted to it. But the People,
in&s;tead of entering upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s for which
they were conven'd, fell into tedious and tri|fling
Debates about other Matters, and &s;pun
out the Time, 'till nine of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Gal|lies
got clear of the Harbour, and put to Sea;
which <HI>Timoleon</HI> having &s;ecret notice of, found
means to &s;lip unob&s;erv'd through the Croud,
and having got on board the remaining Gal|ly,
join'd the re&s;t of his Squadron, and he land|ed
at <HI>Tauromenium</HI> in <HI>Sicily,</HI> where <HI>Andromachus</HI>
the Governor receiv'd him with open Arms,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> with him in his De&s;ign of freeing the
<PB N="280" REF="306">
I&s;land. But few of the other Towns as yet
came in to him. They had a general Di&s;tru&s;t
of all Foreign Commanders, having found by
Experience, that they had been allured by them
with fair Promi&s;es, and afterwards been more
oppre&s;s'd by them, than by tho&s;e from whom
they pretended to deliver them. The <HI>Syracu|&s;ians</HI>
had a better Opinion of him; at lea&s;t they
had no body el&s;e to depend on: And yet they
had very little Hopes of Relief from him,
whil&s;t <HI>Icetes</HI> was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Town,
<HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> of the Citadel, and the <HI>Carthaginians</HI>
of the Harbour.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t Scene of Action was at <HI>Adranum</HI> a
&s;mall City below Mount <HI>Aetna;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Suc|ce&s;s at <HI>A|dranum.</HI></NOTE> where the In|habitants
being divided, one Party call'd in <HI>Ti|moleon</HI>
to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the other, <HI>Icetes.</HI>
The former was glad to take this Opportunity
of advancing further into the Country; and
the latter thought it &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to prevent
him, that he immediately march'd thither with
a Detachment of five thou&s;and Men. <HI>Timoleon</HI>
arriv'd there at the &s;ame time with his whole
Strength, which amounted to no more than
twelve Hundred. However taking advantage
of the Enemy, whil&s;t they were fixing their
Tents, he fell upon them with great Fury, and
put them to flight, having kill'd three hundred
of them, and taken double that Number of Pri|&s;oners,
together with their Camp, and all their
Baggage.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="307">
This pro&s;perous Beginning gave him great
Credit,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olym.</HI> 109. 1. Other Pla|ces &s;ubmit to him.</NOTE> and increas'd his Followers; &s;o that not
only <HI>Adranum,</HI> but mo&s;t of the other neigh|bouring
Towns &s;ubmitted to him. <HI>Mamercus</HI>
Tyrant of <HI>Catana,</HI> a Man of great Wealth and
Power, enter'd into Alliance with him; and
the City of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> at the &s;ame time declared
for him. It likewi&s;e advanc'd his Affairs at
<HI>Syracu&s;e;</HI> where <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> finding his Ca&s;e de&s;|perate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> &s;urrenders him&s;elf.</NOTE> cho&s;e rather to give up him&s;elf and the
Citadel to him, as a Man of Honour and Bra|very,
than to become a Prey to <HI>Icetes,</HI> whom
he de&s;pis'd for his Behaviour in the late Action.
Accordingly <HI>Timoleon</HI> &s;ent four hundred Men
to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Citadel; and they
gain'd their Entrance by Stealth, and in &s;mall
Companies. They found there two thou&s;and
Soldiers, whom <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> likewi&s;e gave up to
them, together with a va&s;t Magazine of Stores,
and Arms for &s;eventy thou&s;and Men.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> him&s;elf, he was conducted
out privately,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olymp.</HI> 109. 2. and is &s;ent to <HI>Co|rinth.</HI></NOTE> and carried to <HI>Timoleon</HI>'s Camp;
from whence he was tran&s;ported to <HI>Corinth,</HI>
where he became a publick Spectacle. People
flock'd from all Parts, to &s;ee the Man who
had made &s;o much Noi&s;e in <HI>Sicily,</HI> and who&s;e
Name was become formidable even to <HI>Greece.</HI>
But he appear'd very ea&s;y and compo&s;ed, and
without any Marks either of Terror, or of
Dignity. In&s;tead of endeavouring to retrieve
his Affairs, he fell into a mean way of Life,
<PB N="282" REF="308">
&s;auntering about in the Shops and the Shambles,
drinking in Taverns, or &s;quabbling with lewd

taught School for Bread.</P>
<P><HI>Timoleon</HI> having met with &s;uch Succe&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Timole|on's fur|ther Suc|ce&s;&s;es.</NOTE> <HI>Ice|tes</HI>
was &s;o terrify'd, that he had &s;ent for a

the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> came over to him, with
an hundred and fifty Sail of Ships, and &s;ixty
thou&s;and Men. Whereupon he block'd up the
Citadel, and march'd in order to be&s;iege <HI>Ca|tana</HI>
likewi&s;e, where <HI>Timoleon</HI> then lay. But be|fore
he had made any Progre&s;s there, he re|ceiv'd
advice, that <HI>Leon</HI> a <HI>Corinthian,</HI> who com|manded
in the Citadel at <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> had made
a &s;ucce&s;sful Sally, that he had kill'd one part
of the Be&s;iegers, and put the re&s;t to flight;
and that having taken <HI>Acradina,</HI> the &s;tronge&s;t
Quarter of the Town, he had added Works
to &s;ecure it, and to join it to the Citadel. <HI>lce|tes</HI>
immediately return'd to <HI>Syracu&s;e;</HI> and <HI>Ti|moleon</HI>
having lately receiv'd a Supply of two

<HI>Corinth,</HI> &s;oon follow'd him.</P>
<P>However, he had as yet no more than four
thou&s;and Men to oppo&s;e to a numerous Army:
But there happen'd a lucky Incident, which
gave him great Encouragement. Whil&s;t he
lay before the Town, &s;ome of his <HI>Corinthians</HI>
falling into company with a Party of Mercenaries
<PB N="283" REF="309">
who &s;erv'd under <HI>Icetes,</HI> took occa&s;ion

<HI>Magon,</HI> that, for fear of being betray'd and &s;a|cificed,
he forthwith embark'd his Troops,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Car|thaginians <HI>quit</HI> Sicily.</NOTE> and

liv'd, they made no Law or Treaty, nor did any
extraordinary Act of Government, wherein he
was not con&s;ulted. As to what remains to be
&s;aid concerning him, it will fall in more pro|perly
with the Account of his Death, which
happen'd two Years later.</P>
<P>During the former Part of the&s;e Commotions
in <HI>Sicily, Philip</HI> was gaining Ground upon the
<HI>Illyrians,</HI> and &s;ettling his Conque&s;ts at home:
But before the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Affairs in that
I&s;land, he had carried his Arms into <HI>Thrace</HI> and
the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> among the <HI>Athenian</HI> Colonies and
Confederates, and thereby given occa&s;ion to fre&s;h
Di&s;turbances, which &s;hould have been related in
their due Order of Time; but I have cho&s;e ra|ther
to do it now by way of Retro&s;pect, than
to break into the Narration of what pa&s;s'd at <HI>Sy|racu&s;e.</HI>
In the fir&s;t Year of the 109th <HI>Olympiad,</HI>
he march'd into <HI>The&s;&s;aly;</HI> and having clear'd out
the Remains of Tyranny in the &s;everal Cities
there, he not only confirm'd the <HI>The&s;&s;alians</HI> in
<PB N="290" REF="316">
his Intere&s;t, but gain'd over many of their Neigh|bours.</P>
<P>Having
&s;trengthen'd him&s;elf in the&s;e Parts, he
went the next Year into <HI>Thrace,</HI> where he had form'd
a De&s;ign again&s;t the <HI>Cher&s;one&s;e.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Philip</HI>'s De&s;ign a|gain&s;t the <HI>Cher&s;one&s;e</HI> of <HI>Thrace.</HI></NOTE> This Penin&s;ula
had, with &s;ome little Interruption, been for many
Years in the Hands of the <HI>Athenians:</HI> But <HI>Cotys,</HI>
as being King of the Country, had lately wre&s;ted
it from them, and left it in Succe&s;&s;ion to his Son
<HI>Cher&s;obleptes.</HI> He not being able to defend him|&s;elf
again&s;t <HI>Philip,</HI> gave it back to the <HI>Athenians,</HI>
re&s;erving to him&s;elf only <HI>Cardia</HI> the capital City.
But <HI>Philip</HI> having &s;oon after routed him of the
re&s;t of his Dominions, the <HI>Cardians,</HI> for fear of
falling again under the Power of the <HI>Athenians,</HI>
threw them&s;elves into his Protection.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is op|po&s;ed by D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pithes,</NOTE> <HI>Diopithes,</HI>
who was the Chief of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Colony lately
&s;ent to the <HI>Cher&s;one&s;e,</HI> con&s;ider'd this Proceeding
of <HI>Philip</HI> in &s;upporting the <HI>Cardians,</HI> as an Act
of Ho&s;tility again&s;t <HI>Athens.</HI> Whereupon he in|vaded
the Maritime Part of <HI>Thrace,</HI> and carried
away a great deal of Botty. <HI>Philip</HI> being at this
time in the upper Part of the Country, was not
in a Condition to do him&s;elf Ju&s;tice: But he
wrote to complain of it at <HI>Athens,</HI> as an In|fraction
of the Peace; and his Creatures there
were not wanting on their Part, to aggravate
the Charge again&s;t <HI>Diopithes,</HI> as having acted
without Orders,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> and taken it upon him&s;elf to
renew the War. They likewi&s;e accus'd him o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
committing Acts of Pyracy, and of laying their
<PB N="291" REF="317">
Allies under Contribution. But whatever Grounds
there were for this Part of the Accu&s;ation, the
Government of <HI>Athens</HI> was principally to blame
in it: For having no proper Fund for the War,
they &s;ent out their Generals without Mony or
Provi&s;ions, and left them to &s;hift for them&s;elves,
and yet made them an&s;werable for any Mi&s;car|riages
that &s;hould happen for want of their being
better &s;upply'd. This was a great Di&s;courage|ment
to the Service, and put tho&s;e who were
employ'd in it, upon pillaging and plundering
in &s;uch a manner, as they would otherwi&s;e have
been a&s;ham'd of. <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> in an Harangue
that he made upon the State of the <HI>Cher&s;one&s;e,</HI>
undertook the Defence of <HI>Diopithes.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Demo&s;the|nes defends him,</NOTE> And altho'
that might be the principal De&s;ign of his Speech;
yet he enter'd into a great Variety of other Mat|ter,
and laid open &s;o much of the pre&s;ent Situa|tion
of Affairs both in <HI>Athens,</HI> and &s;everal other
States of <HI>Greece,</HI> that it may be proper to give
the Reader a &s;hort Account of it; and the ra|ther,
becau&s;e it contains the Sub&s;tance of what
<HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> has &s;aid in &s;ome of his other Ora|tions,

Terms, again&s;t <HI>Philip,</HI> and his Partizans in the
<HI>Athenian</HI> A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>He urg'd to the People in Behalf of <HI>Diopithes,</HI>
that he had done nothing but what his Nece&s;&s;ities
had forc'd him to, and that he had only follow'd
the Example of his Predece&s;&s;ors, who had con|&s;tantly
laid the I&s;landers, and other <HI>A&s;iatick</HI>
<PB N="292" REF="318">
Allies under Contribution; and that they who
paid it, found their Account in it, in having
Convoys to &s;ecure them from Pyrates, and o|therwi&s;e
to protect their Trade. That in&s;tead
of being que&s;tion'd, for u&s;ing his Indu&s;try to
procure that Sub&s;i&s;tence for the Troops, which
he could not obtain from the Government, they
ought forthwith to &s;end him a Reinforcement,
and to provide better for their Pay. However
he told them, That whatever Exactions or Vio|lences
he had been guilty of, he was their Offi|cer,
and it was always in their Power to &s;end
for him home, and to puni&s;h him, as they found
he de&s;erv'd. But he told them at the &s;ame time,
that this Accu&s;ation was made u&s;e of only as an
Handle to divert them from inquiring into the
Motions and De&s;igns of <HI>Philip,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">and in|veighs a|gain&s;t <HI>Phi|lip.</HI></NOTE> who, with a
powerful Army in <HI>Thrace,</HI> and upon the <HI>Helle|&s;pont,</HI>
was ravaging their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, debauching
their Allies, and &s;tirring up again&s;t them both
the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Barbarians.</HI> That whil&s;t he
was engag'd in the&s;e Practices, he was to be
look'd upon as the fir&s;t Aggre&s;&s;or; and that
they were not to think them&s;elves &s;ecure, becau&s;e
he was not come up to the <HI>Piraeus,</HI> nor was at|tacking
them in <HI>Attica.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Among other Arguments to induce them to
make head again&s;t him, he told them, they had
more to apprehend from him, than their Neigh|bours
had; and he explain'd it to them by an
artful Piece of Flattery:</HI> You mu&s;t not imagine,
<PB N="293" REF="319">
&s;aid <HI>he,</HI> that <HI>Philip</HI> will treat you in the &s;ame
manner with the re&s;t of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and that
he will content him&s;elf with barely making Slaves
of you. No; his De&s;ign is to de&s;troy and extirpate
you. For he is &s;en&s;ible, that a People, who have
&s;o long known what it is to command, will never
bear Servitude, and that you are incapable of doing
it, if you would: He knows, that you would be
always &s;truggling to break your Chains, and that
you would give him more Di&s;turbance than all the
re&s;t of the World. And therefore you may look
upon it as an undoubted Maxim, that he can intend
nothing le&s;s than you total Ruin and De&s;truction.</P>
<P>From thence he proceeded to inveigh again&s;t
the Orators,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and the Orators.</NOTE> for the treacherous Part they had
acted upon the&s;e Proceedings of <HI>Philip;</HI> and he
did it with great Boldne&s;s and Acrimony, by
expo&s;ing their fal&s;e Rea&s;oning, their fal&s;e Zeal,
and their fal&s;e Courage. He told the People, it
was in vain to think of their being victorious
abroad, &s;o long as they nouri&s;h'd in their Bo&s;om
the&s;e Pen&s;ioners and Creatures of their Enemy;
the&s;e dome&s;tick Foes, who were as &s;o many hidden
Rocks and Shelves, upon which they mu&s;t one
Day unavoidably &s;uffer Shipwreck. He went on
to &s;hew them, that the in&s;olent Behaviour of
<HI>Philip</HI> towards them, was wholly owing to the&s;e
Haranguers, who &s;av'd him the trouble of ma|naging
and undermining them, as he did the
other States, with an Appearance at lea&s;t of
bearing them Good-will, and doing them good
<PB N="294" REF="320">
Offices. He in&s;tanc'd in the <HI>The&s;&s;alians,</HI> tha
tho' he had brought them under Subjection, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
had taken &s;ome Pains to inveigle them into it
and had &s;trow'd the Way to it with Flowers
by freeing them from their Tyrants, and by re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
&s;toring them to their Seat among the <HI>Amphictyons</HI>
That he had drawn the poor <HI>Olynthians</HI> into hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

had lull'd them a&s;leep by his Ce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Potidae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
to them. That he had at pre&s;ent got the <HI>The|bans</HI>
under his Dependence; but that he had
thought it proper to gild their Chains, by put|ting
them in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eotia,</HI> by laying
wa&s;te the Country of their Enemies the <HI>Phocians,</HI>
and by delivering them from a long and bur|then&s;ome
War. <HI>But why,</HI> &s;ays Demo&s;thenes,
<HI>does he not think it worth his while to amu&s;e you
with &s;ome &s;uch Marks of his Complai&s;ance and his
Bounty? Why does he not endeavour to gain upon
you by &s;ome real or pretended Benefits? On the
contrary, he infringes your Treaties, breaks into
your Alliances, and &s;eizes your Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and does
it with an high Hand, without &s;o much as at|tempting
to excu&s;e, or di&s;&s;emble it.</HI> He tells them
the Rea&s;on of this Difference in <HI>Philip</HI>'s Conduct
with regard to them, was, becau&s;e he had no need
of keeping any Mea&s;ures with them, or of &s;aving
Appearances: For that he knew he had a Party
among them, who were always ready to plead
his Cau&s;e, and to ju&s;tify all his Proceedings.
<HI>Athens,</HI> &s;ays Demo&s;thenes, <HI>is the only City of
<PB N="295" REF="321">
Greece,</HI> where a Man may, with Impunity, di&s;play
his Eloquence in Defence, and even in Prai&s;e of the
common Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>He expatiated further upon the ba&s;e and un|generous
Artifices of the Orators, in per&s;ecu|ting
their Fellow-Citizens.</HI> They, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> who
have no real Concern for the Welfare of the
Publick, may with Ea&s;e and Safety cen&s;ure, ar|raign
and condemn. They can always &s;ecure them|&s;elves
from Danger by their inexhau&s;tible Fund of
Flattery and Di&s;&s;imulation; by their daily &s;hifting
and changing their Opinion, according to the dif|ferent
Ta&s;te and Humour of the People; and by
di&s;gui&s;ing and concealing from them the weak and
di&s;orderly State of their Affaris. <HI>The truly brave
and zealous Citizen he de&s;cribes in another
manner:</HI> That the only thing he has in view, is
the Peoples Intere&s;t; that, in order to promote
it, he oppo&s;es their Inclinations, combats their Opi|nion,
and makes no Conce&s;&s;ions to them out of
Complai&s;ance; that he delivers his Mind freely
and openly, according to the be&s;t of his Judg|ment;
and makes him&s;elf accountable to them not
only for the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of his Advice, but like|wi&s;e
for the Succe&s;s of it. Demo&s;thenes <HI>does not
directly apply this Character to him&s;elf; but
it may be ea&s;ily collected from what follows,
that he thought it belong'd to him.</HI> I know,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> Fellow-Citizens, as well as others, how
to flatter, to accu&s;e, to pro&s;cribe, and to practi&s;e
all tho&s;e other little Arts of gaining Credit with
<PB N="296" REF="322">
you; but I have a Soul above it. I have no
Avarice, nor Ambition; my chief Aim is to re|peat
and inculcate tho&s;e Truths, which, becau&s;e
they are di&s;ta&s;teful to you, mu&s;t therefore give my
Rivals the Preference in your Favour; and yet
they are &s;uch, as, if you would hearken to them,
would give you the advantage over your Enemies.
It is to me a Part unworthy of a good Citizen,
to &s;tudy ways of ri&s;ing on a &s;udden to the highe&s;t
Rank of Men in <HI>Athens,</HI> when you are at the
&s;ame time &s;inking to the lowe&s;t Rank of Men in
<HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>When he had thus endeavour'd to open their
Eyes, and to free them from their Dependence
on the other Orators, he pre&s;s'd them to pro|ceed
forthwith to Action. <HI>It is my part,</HI> &s;ays
he, <HI>to propo&s;e; it is yours to re&s;olve, and to exe|cute.</HI>
He concludes with exhorting them to &s;up|ply
the Nece&s;&s;ities of the State; to keep their
Troops on foot, and in good Di&s;cipline; to
di&s;patch Amba&s;&s;adors to all Parts, with In&s;tru|ctions
to communicate their Re&s;olutions, and
to give notice of the common Danger that
threaten'd <HI>Greece;</HI> and thereupon to negotiate
and conclude whatever &s;hould be thought re|qui&s;ite
for the Service of the Common-wealth.
And above all, he advis'd them to &s;hew no
Mercy to tho&s;e who pro&s;tituted them&s;elves for
Gain to the Enemy of their Country.</P>
<P>Whatever effect the&s;e Remon&s;trances had for
the pre&s;ent, <HI>Philip</HI> was not di&s;courag'd from
<PB N="297" REF="323">
making further Attempts:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Philip</HI> takes ad|vantage of the Divi&s;i|ons in <HI>Pe|loponne|&s;us.</HI></NOTE> And he was fur|ni&s;h'd
with a Pretence for it by the Divi&s;ions
which were now in <HI>Peloponne&s;us;</HI> and they were
owing chiefly to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> who having lit|tle
to do in the late Foreign Tran&s;actions, were
recovering their Strengh at home, and, accord|ing

them, put them&s;elves under the Protection of
<HI>Philip;</HI> and the <HI>Thebans</HI> joining with them,

The natural Balance again&s;t it, was an
Union between <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Sparta,</HI> which the
<HI>Spartans</HI> pre&s;s'd with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, as the

<P>He had, before this Action, given &s;everal.
Proos of his Courage and Capacity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha|racter.</NOTE> but he
began now to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf as a General,
and to bear a principal Part in the Affairs of
the Government. As he had Talents very well
&s;uited to both the&s;e Capacities, he did not ap|prove
the modern Practice of allotting the Civil
Power to one Sett of Men, and the Military
to another, but was for having them united in
the &s;ame Per&s;ons, as they formerly were in <HI>Solon,
<PB N="299" REF="325">
Ari&s;tides</HI> and <HI>Pericles.</HI> He had &s;tudied Philo&s;o|phy
under <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Xenorates:</HI> and in Ora|tory
he was upon a level with the be&s;t Speak|ers
of his time. He was not &s;o pompous and
diffu&s;e as they; but was better heard than mo&s;t
of them. His Manner was plain and conci&s;e,
&s;trong and pointed, full of Matter and good
Sen&s;e, and always to the purpo&s;e. When he
was one Day in the A&s;&s;embly ob&s;erv'd to be
very pen&s;ive, and his Friends ask'd him the
Rea&s;on of it, <HI>I am con&s;idering,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>how to
contract what I have to &s;ay.</HI> And <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI>
who had a &s;ecret Jealou&s;y of him, was wont
to call him, <HI>The Pruning-book of his Periods.</HI>
This Brevity and Simplicity in his Diction,
was of the <HI>Spartan</HI> kind; and he had &s;till more
of the <HI>Spartan</HI> in his manner of Deportment.
He had &s;uch a &s;ettled Compo&s;ure in his Coun|tenance,
that he was never &s;een either to laugh
or cry. He was grave and au&s;tere even to
Moro&s;ene&s;s; in&s;omuch that they who were Stran|gers
to him, did not care to acco&s;t him. But this
Severity was more in his Appearance than in
his Temper: For he was naturally very ea&s;y
and conver&s;able; humane and beneficent; and a
great Patron of the di&s;tre&s;s'd, even of tho&s;e
who had mo&s;t oppos'd him. His Friends re|proving
him for pleading in behalf of an ill
Man, He told them, <HI>The Innocent had no need
of an Advocate.</HI> In the Camp he went very
thinly clad, and generally barefoot; and he lived
<PB N="300" REF="326">
at home with his Family much in the &s;ame
coar&s;e hardy way. There is upon this occa&s;i|on
a remarkable Saying of his Wife, who was
noted for her Virtue and good Hou&s;e-wifery;
and being vi&s;ited by an <HI>Ionian</HI> Woman of Di|&s;tinction,
who &s;hew'd her all her Jewels, Em|broidery,
and other rich Ornaments, <HI>For my
part,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to her, <HI>My only Ornament, is my
good Man</HI> Phocion, <HI>who has commanded the</HI> Athe|nians
<HI>now the&s;e twenty Years.</HI> He was not &s;o
happy in his Son, who being inclined to Luxu|ry
and Exce&s;s, he &s;ent him to <HI>Sparta</HI> to be put
into a &s;tricter way of Education; and <HI>Demades</HI>
repoarch'd him with it publickly, as an Attempt
to introduce the <HI>Spartan</HI> Manners and Di&s;ci|pline.
He certainly had a very bad Opinion
of the Manners of his Country, and would glad|ly
have reform'd them; but he could not do
it otherwi&s;e than by his Example; and that was
of &s;mall Force again&s;t &s;o general a Corruption.
However as to his own particular, it gain'd
him an Awe and Attention from tho&s;e who
would not imitate him. It created &s;uch an Opi|nion
of him, that he was cho&s;en General up|on
Forty five &s;everal Expeditions, and always
in his Ab&s;ence: For tho' he did not decline
the Service when he was call'd to it, he never
put him&s;elf in the way of it. He was &s;o far
from making a &s;ervile court to the People,
or &s;oothing them in their Follies, that he took
all Occa&s;ions of thwarting and oppo&s;ing them
<PB N="301" REF="327">
and he would never give up a point which he
thought nece&s;&s;ary for the Good or Safety of the
Publick. The Oracle having, upon a certain
Occa&s;ion, told the <HI>Athenians,</HI> That there was
one Man in the City of a different Opinion
from the re&s;t, and Enquiry being made who this
&s;hould be; <HI>I,</HI> &s;aid Phocion, <HI>am the Man; I am
pleas'd with nothing that the Common People &s;ay, or
do.</HI> Another time, when he had deliver'd his Opi|nion
to them, and found that it was generally
approved, <HI>I wi&s;h,</HI> &s;aid he, turning to his Friend,
<HI>That what I have propos'd, be not wrong.</HI> He
was &s;o tenacious in what he thought mo&s;t
advi&s;eable, that he would rather &s;uffer him&s;elf
to be treated as a Coward, than enter into a
War, which did not appear to him to be ju&s;t and
nece&s;&s;ary. There is an In&s;tance of this kind,
when being pre&s;s'd to engage the Enemy at a
di&s;advantage, <HI>No,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>You cannot at this
time make me valiant, nor I you wi&s;e.</HI> The truth
is, he was naturally inclin'd to Peace, and con|&s;ider'd
War no otherwi&s;e than as the means of
procuring it. He endeavour'd, by &s;everal pri|vate
Negotiations, to put an end to the War
with the <HI>Macedonians;</HI> and herein he &s;eem'd to
act the Part of a Mediator: But the Modera|tion
and Complai&s;ance, which he &s;hew'd in this
Corre&s;pondence with the Enemies of his Coun|try,
created a Su&s;picion of his being too well
affected to them; and at la&s;t it co&s;t him his
Life. He certainly was upon good Terms with
<PB N="302" REF="328">
<HI>Philip, Alexander</HI> and <HI>Antipater,</HI> who all &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively
e&s;teem'd and care&s;s'd him, and would
have loaded him with Pre&s;ents; but he could
not be prevail'd upon to accept any. Upon
this occa&s;ion <HI>Antipater</HI> was wont to &s;ay, <HI>I have
two Friends at</HI> Athens, Phocion <HI>and</HI> Demades;
<HI>of whom the former will not &s;uffer me to gratify
him at all, and the other is never to be &s;atisfy'd.
Phocion,</HI> upon the whole, was one of the wi&s;e&s;t
and be&s;t &s;ort of Men that <HI>Athens</HI> ever bred.
But the Steadine&s;s of his Virtue, and the Sin|gularity
of his Manners, would not let him drive
on with the Current of the Times he liv'd in;
and <HI>Plutarch</HI> mentions it as his Misfortune,
<HI>That he came to the Helm, when the Publick Bot|tom
was ju&s;t upon &s;inking.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Philip</HI> found his Affairs advance &s;low|ly
in <HI>Euboea,</HI> he thought fit to retreat, and march'd
back to <HI>Thrace,</HI> in order to di&s;tre&s;s the <HI>Athenians</HI>
in tho&s;e Parts, from whence they receiv'd a great
Part of their Provi&s;ions. With this View, in
the la&s;t Year of the 109th <HI>Olympiad,</HI> he laid
Siege to <HI>Perinthus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip <HI>be|&s;ieges</HI> Pe|rinthus</NOTE>, and firmly attach'd to the <HI>Athenians.</HI> He
inve&s;ted it with an Army of thirty thou&s;and
Men; and having rais'd his Works to a great
heighth, &s;o as to command tho&s;e of the Enemy,
he made his A&s;&s;ault with all kinds of battering
Engines. The Inhabitants were no le&s;s active
and re&s;olute on their Part; &s;o that when <HI>Philip</HI>
had made a Breach in the Wall, which he thought
<PB N="303" REF="329">
&s;ufficient to gain his Entrance into the Town, he
found they had run up another Wall within &s;ide;
by means whereof, together with the natural Ad|vantage
of the Place, which ro&s;e up gradually in
the Form of a Theatre, they made a vigorous
Defence, and held out till they were reliev'd from
<HI>Byzantium.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Philip,</HI> to cut off this Communication, divided
his Army, and march'd with one half of it to
form the Siege of <HI>Byzantium,</HI> leaving the other
to carry on that of <HI>Perinthus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>and</HI> Byzan|tium.</NOTE> The&s;e violent
Proceedings gave a general Alarm both in <HI>Greece</HI>
and <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The Lieutenants of the Provinces
near the Coa&s;ts, were order'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Be|&s;ieg'd
with what Forces they could &s;pare. The
I&s;lands of <HI>Chios, Cos</HI> and <HI>Rhodes,</HI> united in the
&s;ame De&s;ign; and the <HI>Athenians</HI> began now to
exert them&s;elves in earne&s;t. <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> had be|fore
endeavour'd to awaken them out of their
Lethargy, and to convince them, that the fir&s;t
Attack again&s;t <HI>Perinthus</HI> was an open Violation
of the Peace: And they &s;o far gave Attention
to him, that <HI>Chares</HI> was &s;ent out with a Fleet.
But he was a bad Man, and of a mean Capacity;
and as &s;uch, he was pitch'd upon by the Creatures
of <HI>Philip</HI> for this Service. He behav'd accord|ing
to their Expectations, and had &s;o little Credit
with the Allies of <HI>Athens</HI> upon the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI>
that they did not care to admit him into their
Ports. But the People now being grown more
&s;en&s;ible of their Danger, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="304" REF="330">
appoint &s;ome other Commander, on whom they
could better depend; and accordingly <HI>Phocion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
was order'd out with a fre&s;h Supply of Forces.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> had hitherto endeavour'd, by many &s;pe|cious
Pretences, to cover his De&s;igns, and to
keep Mea&s;ures with the <HI>Athenians:</HI> But when he
found they had taken the Alarm, and were arm|ing
&s;o many others again&s;t him, he wrote them
an expo&s;tulatory Letter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He endea|vours to ju&s;tify his Proceedings</NOTE> wherein he charg'd them
with the Infraction of their Treaties, and with
many other Injuries, which he pretended to have
receiv'd from them. It was full of Complaints,
Reproaches and Menaces, and was drawn in a
very ma&s;terly manner, with &s;o much Art and
Delicacy, with &s;uch a Variety of Facts, and &s;uch
plau&s;ible Rea&s;oning upon them, and with &s;uch a
Spirit of Maje&s;ty throughout the Whole, that it
may be look'd upon as one of the fine&s;t Pieces
of Antiquity. It was calculated for the U&s;e of
the Partizans at <HI>Athens,</HI> &s;o as to furni&s;h them
with Materials for pleading his Cau&s;e in the
A&s;&s;embly; and the Intent of it was, to try if it
were yet too late to divert the People from pu&s;h|ing
things to an Extremity. The Point that he
laid the greate&s;t Stre&s;s upon, was the engaging
the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> again&s;t him; and this he imputed to
the <HI>Athenians.</HI> It does not clearly appear how
far they were concern'd in it: But it is certain,
that, in order to check the Growth of his Power.
<HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> had prepar'd the People for an Al|liance
with <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and &s;till pre&s;s'd it; and <HI>Pau|&s;anias</HI>
<PB N="305" REF="331">
&s;ays, that the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Troops, which were
employ'd on this occa&s;ion, were commanded by
<HI>Apollodorus</HI> an <HI>Athenian.</HI> From &s;uch Circum|&s;tances
as the&s;e, <HI>Philip</HI> thought him&s;elf &s;uffici|ently
warranted to remon&s;trate in the manner
he did to the <HI>Athenians.</HI> He told them, <HI>That
by this In&s;tance of their calling in the</HI> Per&s;ians,
<HI>and that at a time when he was in peace with them,
they had &s;hewn more Hatred and Rancour again&s;t
him, than in ca&s;es of the mo&s;t open and declared En|mity
between them; That they had acted in it
contrary to all the Rules of Prudence and Poli|cy,
and to the con&s;tant Practice not only of their
Ance&s;tors, but of them&s;elves likewi&s;e.</HI> And to this
purpo&s;e, he reminded them, that they had &s;ome
time &s;ince pa&s;s'd a formal Re&s;olution, to invite
him to act in conjunction with them and the
other <HI>Grecians,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> as <HI>Barbari|ans,</HI>
and as their common Enemy. His ap|plying
the&s;e Appellations of <HI>Barbarians</HI> and Fo|reigners
to the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> was an artful way of
di&s;claiming them with regard to him&s;elf, and
of blending together the Intere&s;ts of <HI>Greece</HI> and
<HI>Macedonia,</HI> as if they were in&s;eparable. <HI>Demo|&s;thenes,</HI>
to prevent the Impre&s;&s;ions this Letter

Arguments contain'd in it. They were found|ed

as to him&s;elf, his Di&s;appointment in this Ex|pedition,
with the Lo&s;s of a good Number of

the <HI>Triballi</HI> of <HI>Moe&s;ia</HI> pretending to a Share of

was laid for them, and agreed to the latter
of the&s;e Propo&s;als. Hereupon a formal Em|ba&s;&s;y
was &s;ent to <HI>Philip,</HI> to demand his A&s;&s;i|&s;tance

eagerly pur&s;u'd, and which was, in effect,

<P>The News of it arriving at <HI>Athens</HI> in the

when it was expected, that &s;ome of the Mem|bers

Danger they apprehended from <HI>Philip,</HI>
was his late Alliance with the <HI>Thebans;</HI> and
this was the point that <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> labour'd
chiefly to clear up to them, and to make
it appear, that the <HI>Thebans</HI> were not &s;o &s;trong|ly
attach'd to him as they imagin'd. <HI>For

Wherefore he propos'd, That all who were able
to bear Arms, &s;hould march out of the City,

inveterate Enmity and Rancour, which had &s;o

which, he told them, would only &s;erve to
hinder, or retard that Union and good Corre|&s;pondence,
which were now become &s;o nece&s;&s;ary

That Amba&s;&s;adors &s;hould be &s;ent to the

in form was drawn up, with an additional Clau&s;e,
That a Fleet of two hundred Sail &s;hould be
fitted out, to cruize near <HI>Thermopylae.</HI></P>
<P>There being no time to be lo&s;t in this Ne|gotiation
with the <HI>Thebans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Nego|tiation with the <HI>Thebans.</HI></NOTE> Amba&s;&s;adors were
forthwith di&s;patch'd to them, with <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI>
at the head of them; and they were met by
others on the part of <HI>Philip.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Python</HI> op|po&s;es him.</NOTE> The principal of
them was <HI>Python,</HI> who was a <HI>Byzantine</HI> by Birth,
and had been made a free Citizen of <HI>Athens,</HI>
but was now in <HI>Philip</HI>'s Intere&s;t. He was a
very able and forcible Speaker, and therefore
was upon this occa&s;ion oppos'd to <HI>Demo&s;thenes.</HI>
The <HI>Macedonians</HI> were heard fir&s;t, the Prefe|rence
being given to them as Friends and Allies.
They &s;et out with large Encomiums upon <HI>Phi|lip,</HI>
and after a long Recital of the many Bene|fits
and Advantages the <HI>Thebans</HI> had receiv'd
from him, and the many Injuries and Provo|cations
they had receiv'd from <HI>Athens,</HI> they
endeavour'd to excite their Gratitude on the
one hand, and to fire their Re&s;entment on the
other. They al&s;o tempted them with the Hopes
of Booty, which, they told them, they &s;hould
find in great abundance in <HI>Attica,</HI> and that they
would at the &s;ame time prevent the ravaging
their own Country, and making it the Seat of
the War, which would be the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;e|quence
of their entering into an Alliance with
<PB N="314" REF="340">
<HI>Athens.</HI> Upon the whole, they propos'd to them
in the alternative, either that they &s;hould join
with <HI>Philip</HI> in the Inva&s;ion of <HI>Attica,</HI> or that
they &s;hould &s;it &s;till, and give him a free Pa&s;&s;age
thorugh <HI>Boeotia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> by way of Reply, u&s;ed the
&s;ame king of Rea&s;oning with the <HI>Thebans,</HI> as
he had done with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> to convince
them of the Nece&s;&s;ity of proceeding again&s;t
<HI>Philip</HI> as their common Enemy: For that
whatever Words or Pretences he made u&s;e of,
his De&s;igns were too vi&s;ible from his Actions.
He in&s;tanc'd particularly in the manner of his
&s;eizing upon <HI>Elat&ecirc;a.</HI> He told them, <HI>That in
ca&s;e he &s;hould &s;ucceed &s;o far as to conquer</HI> Attica,
Thebes <HI>would &s;uffer in its Turn; That he would go
on from one City, and one Province to another, and
would never &s;top 'till he had made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter
of the whole.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Thebans</HI> were not very inclinable to enter
into any Engagements on either &s;ide: They had
too lively a Sen&s;e of the Mi&s;eries they had un|dergone,
e&s;pecially whil&s;t the Wounds they had
receiv'd in the <HI>Phocian</HI> War were &s;till fre&s;h up|on
them. But <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> fired them to &s;uch a
degree, that they were no longer Ma&s;ters of
them&s;elves. The Force of his Eloquence, upon
this Occa&s;ion, is &s;aid <HI>to have ca&s;t a Mi&s;t over their
Under&s;tanding, to have carried them away like a
Whirlwind, and to have work'd them up to a &s;ort
of Enthu&s;ia&s;m:</HI> In&s;omuch that, laying a&s;ide all
<PB N="315" REF="341">
Fear and Gratitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>The|bans</HI> enter into an Alliance with <HI>A|thens.</HI></NOTE> and other prudential Con|&s;iderations,
they declar'd them&s;elves for the Al|liance
with <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>That which animated <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> next to his
Zeal for the publick Safety, was his having to do
with a Man of <HI>Python</HI>'s Abilities; and he &s;ome
time after, took occa&s;ion to value him&s;elf upon
the Victory he had obtained over him. <HI>I did
not give way,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to the boa&s;ting</HI> Python, <HI>when
he would have bore me down with a Torrent of
Words.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Demo&s;the|nes</HI> values him&s;elf upon his Succe&s;s.</NOTE> He gloried more in the Succe&s;s of this
Negotiation, than of any other he had been
employ'd in, and &s;poke of it as his Ma&s;ter|piece
in Politicks. It was certainly of the great|e&s;t
Importance to <HI>Athens</HI> at this time, when
<HI>Philip</HI> &s;eem'd fully bent on her De&s;truction, and
when &s;he had no other immediate Pro&s;pect of
Relief, but from the gaining the <HI>Thebans. De|mo&s;thenes</HI>
therefore, to do him&s;elf Ju&s;tice, put the
People in mind of the Danger they had e&s;cap'd.
He told them, <HI>It was he, who had di&s;per&s;ed that
Cloud which hung over the City, and that, by this
In&s;tance of his unwearied Diligence and Zeal for
the Publick, he had exceeded all that had been done
by the greate&s;t Orators of former Ages.</HI> He was
generally more mode&s;t than he appears to have
been in this Ca&s;e: But it mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd,
that what he &s;aid upon this Occa&s;ion, was &s;ome
time after, in his Defence again&s;t <HI>Ae&s;chines,</HI> who,
by his artful and invidious in&s;inuations, had put
him under a Nece&s;&s;ity of enumerating his Ser|vices
<PB N="316" REF="342">
to the Common-wealth, and of &s;et|ting
them in the &s;tronge&s;t Light they would
bear.</P>
<P>When <HI>Philip</HI> found him&s;elf thus di&s;appointed
of the <HI>Thebans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip's Artifices to avoid fighting.</NOTE> he &s;ued again to the <HI>Athenians</HI>
for Peace: but they &s;aw his Drift too plainly
to tru&s;t him, and were too much exa&s;perated
to hearken to any Terms of Accommodation.
However, he re&s;olved to &s;tand it out with them,
and both Sides prepared for Battle. But before
it came to Action, he try'd another Stratagem;
which was, by bribing the Oracle, to terrify them
with fatal Omens and predictions concerning the
Event of it. <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> to prevent the&s;e
Warnings making any deep Impre&s;&s;ion, treated
them with the utmo&s;t Contempt; and it was
upon this Occa&s;ion, that he charged the
Prie&s;te&s;s with <HI>Philippizing.</HI> He put the <HI>Thebans</HI>
in mind of their <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> and the <HI>Atheni|ans</HI>
of <HI>Pericles,</HI> who, he told them, were go|vern'd
by Rea&s;on and good Sen&s;e, and would
not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be carried away by &s;uch
idle &s;uper&s;titious Fancies, which they look'd
upon only as a Cloak for Cowardice. The
<HI>Athenians</HI> were &s;o eager for the War, that they
ea&s;ily got the better of the&s;e frightful Appre|hen&s;ions;
and <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> had, by his la&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Treaty, gain'd &s;uch an A&s;cendant both ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
them and the <HI>Thebans,</HI> that they &s;ubmitted them+&s;elves intirely to his Directions.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="343">
Accordingly they took the Field,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olymp.</HI> 110. 3. The Battle at <HI>Chero|n&ecirc;a.</HI></NOTE> and en|camp'd
together near <HI>Cheron&ecirc;a</HI> in <HI>Boeotia;</HI> where
<HI>Philip</HI> met them with thirty thou&s;and Foot,
and two thou&s;and Hor&s;e. He was &s;omewhat
&s;uperior to them in Numbers, and more &s;o in
the Goodne&s;s of his Officers. He gave the Com|mand
of the left Wing of his Army to his Son
<HI>Alexander,</HI> but, in regard to his Youth, he
placed the be&s;t of his Officers about him; and
the right Wing he took to him&s;elf. In the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Army, the <HI>Thebans</HI> were on the right,
and the <HI>Athenians</HI> on the left. At Sun-ri&s;ing
the two Armies join'd Battle, and behav'd with
&s;uch equal Courage and Bravery, that it was
long before any Impre&s;&s;ion was made on either
&s;ide; till at length <HI>Alexander,</HI> exerting him&s;elf in
an extraordinary manner, broke in upon the
<HI>Sacred Band</HI> of the <HI>Thebans,</HI> and cut them to
Pieces; after which, the re&s;t of that Wing were
ea&s;ily routed. <HI>Philip,</HI> who had to do with the
<HI>Athenians,</HI> forc'd them likewi&s;e to give way:
But they &s;oon recover'd their Ground; and <HI>Ly|&s;icles,</HI>
who, in Conjunction with <HI>Chares,</HI> com|manded
the <HI>Athenian</HI> Troops, pu&s;h'd forwards
into the Centre of <HI>Philip</HI>'s Army; where, ima|gining
him&s;elf victorious, he cry'd out to his
Men, <HI>Come on, let us pur&s;ue them to</HI> Macedonia.
<HI>Philip,</HI> ob&s;erving what pa&s;s'd, and that <HI>Ly&s;icles,</HI>
in&s;tead of attacking his Phalanx in Flank, when
he had &s;o fair an Opportunity, went on a

<P><HI>Philip</HI> was tran&s;ported with this Victory beyond

which he gave upon that Occa|&s;ion,
went into the Field of Battle, where he in|&s;ulted
over the Slain, and upbraided the Pri|&s;oners
with their Misfortunes. He leap'd and
danc'd about in a frantick manner, and with
an Air of Burle&s;que &s;ung the Beginning of the
Decree, which <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> had drawn up as a
Declaration of the War again&s;t him. <HI>Demades</HI>
who was in the Number of the Pri&s;oners, had
the Courage to reproach him with this unge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
nerous Behaviour, telling him, <HI>That Fortune ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

wrought a thorough Change in him; and he
<PB N="319" REF="345">
was &s;o far from being offended at <HI>Demades,</HI> that
he immediately gave him his Liberty, and
&s;hew'd him afterwards great Marks of Honour
and Friend&s;hip. He likewi&s;e releas'd all the
<HI>Athenian</HI> Captives, and without Ran&s;om; and
when they found him &s;o generou&s;ly di&s;pos'd to|wards
them, they made a Demand of their Bag|gage,
with every thing el&s;e that had been taken
from them; but to that <HI>Philip</HI> reply'd, <HI>Surely they
think I have not beat them.</HI> This Di&s;charge of the
Pri&s;oners was a&s;crib'd in a great mea&s;ure to <HI>De|mades,</HI>
who is &s;aid to have new modell'd <HI>Philip,</HI>
and to have &s;often'd his Temper with the <HI>Attick
Graces,</HI> as <HI>Diodorus</HI> expre&s;&s;es it: And <HI>Philip</HI> him|&s;elf
acknowledg'd upon another Occa&s;ion, that
his frequent Conver&s;e with the <HI>Athenian</HI> Orators,
had been of great u&s;e to him in correcting his
Morals. <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> repre&s;ents his Carriage after the
Battle in a very different Light; as that he took
abundance of Pains to di&s;&s;emble his Joy; that
he affected great Mode&s;ty and Compa&s;&s;ion, and
was not &s;een to laugh; that he would have no
Sacrifice, no Crowns nor Perfumes; that he for|bad
all kind of Sports; and did nothing that
might make him appear to the Conquerors to be
elated, nor to the Conquer'd, to be in&s;olent.
But this Account &s;eems to have been confounded
with others, which were given of him after his
being reform'd by <HI>Demades.</HI> It is certain, that
after his fir&s;t Tran&s;port was over, and that he
began to recollect him&s;elf, he &s;hew'd great Hu|manity
<PB N="320" REF="346">
to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and that, in order &s;til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

pardon tho&s;e who had de&s;erted him in &s;o critical
a Conjuncture. Wherefore he not only took
Ran&s;om for their Pri&s;oners, but made them pay
for leave to bury their Dead. It is further &s;aid,
that either by the Sword, or by Bani&s;hment, he
clear'd the City of the principal Men who had
&s;tood in Oppo&s;ition to him, and confi&s;cated their
Goods; That he recall'd all &s;uch as had been
bani&s;h'd for e&s;pou&s;ing his Intere&s;t, and made 'em
Judges and Magi&s;trates, with a Power of Life
and Death over tho&s;e who had been the Authors
of their Exile. After the&s;e Severities, and after
having plac'd a &s;trong Garri&s;on over them, he

<P>THE Generality of the <HI>Athenians</HI> were not
much dejected upon this Overthrow, e&s;pe|cially
&s;ince <HI>Philip</HI> had &s;hewn &s;o much Moderation
<PB N="321" REF="347">
towards them: But they who &s;aw further into
the Con&s;equences of it, were not very ea&s;y in
their pre&s;ent Situation. <HI>I&s;ocrates</HI> was more par|ticularly
affected with the Lo&s;s and Di&s;grace they
had &s;uffer'd; and was &s;o apprehen&s;ive, that <HI>Philip</HI>
would make &s;ome further u&s;e of his Victory, that
he cho&s;e rather to &s;tarve him&s;elf to death,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I&s;ocrates</HI> &s;tarves him&s;elf.</NOTE> than
to &s;urvive the Liberty of his Country: Which is
a &s;ufficient Proof, that his Intimacy with <HI>Philip,</HI>
which has before been mention'd, was with an
Intent to &s;erve the Common-wealth; and that
his End was good, tho' he was mi&s;taken in the
Means of attaining it, and in the Man he had
to deal with. The Truth is, he was not con|ver&s;ant
enough in publick Affairs. His proper
Province was his School, wherein he &s;ucceeded
beyond any Man of his Time; and he got &s;o much
Mony by it, that he was oblig'd to build a Gally,
and maintain it at his own Charge. <HI>Plutarch</HI>
condemns him for his unactive and reclu&s;e way of
Life, and &s;ets him in a very pedantick Light:
That he &s;at poring at home in his Study, when
every Body el&s;e was in Arms: That, in&s;tead of
&s;harpening his Sword and his Spear, and bright|ning
up his Helmet, he was adapting, ranging
and poli&s;hing his Words and Sentences; and
that he was three <HI>Olympiads</HI> in compo&s;ing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Panegyrick.</NOTE> one
&s;ingle Oration. <HI>How,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>would that Man
have been terrified at the clattering of Weapons, or
the routing of a Phalanx, who was &s;o afraid of
<PB N="322" REF="348">
&s;uffering one Vowel to cla&s;h with another, or to
pronounce a Word where the Syllables were uneven?</HI>
But notwith&s;tanding this Piece of Raillery, he
was generally re&s;pected and admir'd, not only as
a perfect Ma&s;ter in his Profe&s;&s;ion, but as a tho|rough
Well-wi&s;her to his Country.</P>
<P>The Enemies of <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> were not wanting
on this Occa&s;ion, to accu&s;e him as the Author of
their Misfortunes. But the Generality of the
People &s;till retain'd their former good Opinion of
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Con|duct of <HI>De|mo&s;thenes</HI> approved.</NOTE> and not only acquitted him of all that had
been laid to his Charge, but re&s;tor'd him to the
Management of their Affairs, and put them|&s;elves
wholly under his Care and Guidance, to
provide for their future Security. As a further
In&s;tance of their Regard for him, they pitch'd
upon him as the mo&s;t proper Per&s;on to &s;peak
the Funeral Oration upon the Interment of the
Slain. Nothing could be a &s;tronger Mark of
their Approbation of his Services, than the ap|pointing
him, who had advis'd the War, to ce|lebrate

and the manner in which it was carried on, has
already been mention'd as a Reproach to the
Common-wealth. In &s;hort, he was a bad Man,
as well as a bad Officer, and did very little real
Service or Honour to his Country, either at home
or abroad.</P>
<P>This Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olymp. 110. 4. <HI>The Death and Cha|racter</HI> of Timoleon</NOTE> being the la&s;t of the hundred and
tenth <HI>Olympiad,</HI> died <HI>Timoleon.</HI> He had &s;ome
time before lo&s;t his Sight, which he bore very
patiently; and the <HI>Syracu&s;ians,</HI> to alleviate his
Affliction, and to &s;hew their Re&s;pect and Gra|titude
to him, went in great Numbers to vi&s;it
him, and carried with them all the Strangers in
tho&s;e Parts, to entertain them with the Sight of
their great Benefactor. Notwith&s;tanding his
Blindne&s;s, he continu'd to the la&s;t to give his
Attention to the Publick. When any Matter of
Moment came before the A&s;&s;embly, he was con|ducted
to the Theatre in a Sort of Carr, and was
u&s;her'd in with the joyful Acclamations and Be|nedictions
of the People; and when he had de|liver'd
his Opinion, they were always determin'd
<PB N="326" REF="352">
by it. He was buried at the Charge of the
Publick, with great Pomp, and with a general
Lamentation; and Anniver&s;ary Games were in
&s;tituted to do Honour to his Memory. Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
which endear'd him &s;o much to the <HI>Syracu&s;ians<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
be&s;ides the great things he had done for them

common Father, and as a Native of <HI>Sicily,</HI> with|out regard to the Honours and Applau&s;e, that
he might have receiv'd upon his return to <HI>Greece.</HI>
But he was a wi&s;e and moderate Man, as well as
valiant and fortunate; he knew where to &s;top,
and how to enjoy the Fruits of his Conque&s;ts.
There is hardly an In&s;tance of any other <HI>Grecian,</HI>
who, after &s;uch Succe&s;s, went quietly to his Grave,
without expo&s;ing him&s;elf further, &s;o as to fall a
Sacrifice either to his own Ambition, or to the
In&s;olence and Ingratitude of his Countrymen.
<HI>Plutarch</HI> ob&s;erves a remarkable Difference between
the Atchievements of <HI>Timoleon,</HI> and tho&s;e of his
Contemporaries: That in tho&s;e of <HI>Timotheus, A|ge&s;ilaus,
Pelopidas,</HI> and even of <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> who
was the Pattern that <HI>Timoleon</HI> copied after, there
was a certain Stiffne&s;s, Labour and Struggling,
which took off from the Merit and Lu&s;tre of
them; but that tho&s;e of <HI>Timolcon</HI> were like the
Poetry of <HI>Homer,</HI> and the Painting of <HI>Nicoma|chus,</HI>
which, be&s;ides the Strength and Beauty,
that they had in common with others, were more
free and ea&s;y, more grace&s;ul and more ma&s;terly.
We can never too much admire and extol the
<PB N="327" REF="353">
ea&s;y Progre&s;s that he made with an handful of
Men in <HI>Sicily,</HI> by driving out the Tyrants, di&s;|per&s;ing
the numerous Fleets and Armies of the
<HI>Carthaginians,</HI> and taking <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> one of the
&s;tronge&s;t Cities of the World, and which had &s;o
long with&s;tood all the Power of <HI>Athens;</HI> tho' it
mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that it was not &s;o well forti|fied,
nor &s;o well defended now, as in the Time
of the <HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI> War. But tho' his Actions
were &s;o generally applauded, it happen'd once,
that two of the <HI>Syracu&s;ians,</HI> who were popular
Speakers, brought a Charge again&s;t him for &s;ome
Part of his Conduct as General; and one of 'em
demanded, that he &s;hould give Security for his
Appearance; which the People were highly of|fended
at, as thinking that, in his Ca&s;e, the or|dinary
Forms of Ju&s;tice ought to be di&s;pen&s;ed
with. But he would not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be ex|empted
from a due Ob&s;ervance of the Laws,
which he had taken &s;o much Pains to enforce
again&s;t others. However, when the Matter
came to be heard, he treated it as a Piece of
Calumny, and in&s;tead of going about to refute
it, he only thank'd the Gods, that they had
granted his Reque&s;t; for that he had liv'd to &s;ee
the <HI>Syracu&s;ians</HI> now at Liberty to &s;ay whatever
they thought fit. He le&s;t them in full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the Liberty both of &s;peaking and acting; and
they enjoy'd it about twenty Years, till the ill
u&s;e they made of it, gave Ri&s;e to the Tyranny

of <HI>Agathocles,</HI> who brought them again into their

from thence we may date the Downfal of the
Liberties of <HI>Greece.</HI> For tho' <HI>Philip</HI> did not
pur&s;ue his Advantage &s;o far as might naturally
have been expected; yet the Terror of his Arms
kept the whole Country in awe, and pav'd the
Way to its more intire Subjection.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip <HI>pro|po&s;es an Ex|pedition a|gain&s;t</HI> Per|&s;ia,</NOTE> The Point

was tran&s;ported with the Honour done to his

<HI>ought now to invoke the Gods, that the new Queen

who was before di&s;gu&s;ted at the Treatment his

provok'd at that which &s;o nearly concern'd him|&s;elf.
<HI>What?</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>Do you then take me for a

they had much ado to keep him from de&s;troy|ing
him&s;elf. He was &s;o far from &s;ubmitting
him&s;elf to his Father, that he rallied him upon

made up by Means of <HI>Demaratus</HI> a <HI>Corinthian,</HI>

<P><PB N="330" REF="356">
<HI>Philip,</HI> &s;oon after this Accident, met with ano|ther
of the &s;ame kind, which prov'd more fatal
to him.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Mar|riage of his Daughter</HI> Cleopatra.</NOTE> This happen'd upon the Marriage of

add to the Solemnity of the Nuptials, and to
do him&s;elf Honour upon his intended Expedi|tion,
which he had &s;till very much at Heart,
made a mo&s;t magnificent Entertainment, and in|vited
all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Men of <HI>Greece,</HI>
taking this Opportunity to te&s;tify his Grati|tude
for their having cho&s;en him their General.
The &s;everal Cities, from whence they came,
were not wanting on their Part to compliment
him on the Occa&s;ion, and to flatter his Vanity:
They vy'd with one another in &s;ending him
Crowns of Gold; and <HI>Athens</HI> was not le&s;s zea|lous
and devoted to him than the re&s;t. The
next Day after the Fea&s;t, there were publick
Shews to be exhibited, and <HI>Philip</HI> went in great
Pomp to a&s;&s;i&s;t at them, being dre&s;s'd in a white
Robe, and his Nobles and Guards attending
him in the form of a Proce&s;&s;ion. There were
carry'd before him twelve Images of the Gods
of exqui&s;ite &s;ine Workman&s;hip; and a thirteenth
was added, which was more &s;plendid than the re&s;t,
and was to repre&s;ent him&s;elf as One among the
Number of the Deities. But in the Heighth
of the Solemnity, amid&s;t the joyful Acclama|tions
of a numberle&s;s Croud of Spectators from
all Parts, and ju&s;t as his Statue enter'd the
<PB N="331" REF="357">
Theatre, the Ceremony was interrupted by <HI>Pau|&s;anias</HI>
a young <HI>Macedonian</HI> Nobleman. He had
&s;ome time before been gro&s;ly affrnoted by <HI>Attalus,</HI>
who, after he had made him drunk, carnally
abu&s;ed him, and then pro&s;tituted him to others.
<HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> made his Complaint to the King,
and demanded Ju&s;tice: But <HI>Philip</HI> did not care
to hearken to an Accu&s;ation again&s;t the Queen's
Uncle. The young Man renew'd his Suit, and
was &s;o importunate for Redre&s;s, that at la&s;t
<HI>Philip,</HI> to pacify him, gave him a Commi&s;&s;ion
of the fir&s;t Rank in his Guards. <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> did
not look upon this as a Satisfaction for the In|jury
he had receiv'd; and tho' he &s;tifled his
Revenge for &s;ome time, he took the pre&s;ent
Occa&s;ion of executing it in the mo&s;t publick
manner upon the Per&s;on of the King. <HI>Philip</HI>
had order'd his Guards, both before and be|hind,
to keep at a proper Di&s;tance from him,
&s;o as to leave him room enough to appear more
con&s;picuou&s;ly to the People; and as he march'd
alone in that intermediate Space, <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> made
up to him, drew his Dagger and &s;tabb'd him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip <HI>kill'd</HI> by Pau&s;anias.</NOTE> 
and left him dead upon the Spot.</P>
<P><HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> had Hor&s;es ready for his E&s;cape,
and had like to have &s;ucceeded in it; but one
of his Feet being hamper'd in a Vinc, he was
taken and cut to Pieces. <HI>Olympias</HI> is &s;aid to have
provided the Hor&s;es for this purpo&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olympias <HI>acce&s;&s;ary to the Mur|ther.</HI></NOTE> and was
look'd upon not only as privy to the Murther,
but as the chief Promoter of it. Neither was
<PB N="332" REF="358">
<HI>Alexander</HI> him&s;elf quite free from Su&s;picion. But
his Mother was &s;o far from concealing the Part
&s;he had in it, that &s;he affected to make it pub|lick,
and was only afraid le&s;t the Proofs &s;hould
not appear &s;trong enough again&s;t her. The very
Night &s;he went to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the King's Funeral,
&s;he caus'd a Crown of Gold to be put upon the
Head of <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> whil&s;t he was hanging up|on
a Cro&s;s. Some Days after &s;he buried him,
and erected a Tomb for him, and appointed an
Anniver&s;ary-day to be kept in Honour of his
Memory. She likewi&s;e con&s;ecrated the Dagger
with which he committed the Fact. Then &s;he
turn'd her Rage again&s;t <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> for whom
&s;he had been divorced; and having murther'd
her Infant Child at her Brea&s;t, caus'd her to
be hang'd. From the&s;e and &s;everal other In|&s;tances,
which might be given of her Cruelty
and Revenge, it may ea&s;ily be believ'd, that
&s;he was more than con&s;enting to the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion
of the King, and that &s;he made u&s;e of the
Re&s;entment of <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> to &s;atisfy her own.</P>
<P>The News of <HI>Philip</HI>'s Death was a joyful
Surpri&s;e in <HI>Greece,</HI> and particularly in <HI>Athens,</HI>
where the People crown'd them&s;elves with Gar|lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The man|ner in which the News of</HI> Philip'<HI>s Death was receiv'd at</HI> Athens.</NOTE> and decreed a Crown to <HI>Pau&s;anias.</HI> They
&s;acrific'd to the Gods for their Deliverance, and
&s;ung Songs of Triumph, as if <HI>Philip</HI> had been
&s;lain by them in Battle. But this Exce&s;s of
Joy did ill become them: It was look'd upon
as an ungenerous and unmanly In&s;ult upon the
<PB N="333" REF="359">
A&s;hes of a murther'd Prince, and of one whom
they ju&s;t before had rever'd, and crouch'd to
in the mo&s;t abject manner. The&s;e immode|rate
Tran&s;ports were rais'd in them by <HI>De|mo&s;thenes,</HI>
who having the fir&s;t Intelligence of
<HI>Philip</HI>'s Death, went into the A&s;&s;embly unu&s;u|ally
gay and chearful, with a Chaplet on his
Head, and in a rich Habit, tho' it were then
but the &s;eventh Day after the Death of his
Daughter. From this Circum&s;tance <HI>Plutarch,</HI>
at the &s;ame time that he condemns the Beha|viour
of the <HI>Athenians</HI> in general upon this Oc|ca&s;ion,
takes an Handle to ju&s;tify <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI>
and extols him as a Patriot, for not &s;uffering
his Dome&s;tick Afflictions to interfere with the
Good-fortune of the Common-wealth. But he
certainly might have acted the Part of a good
Citizen with more Decency and Compo&s;ure,
and more to the Honour of him&s;elf and his
Country.</P>
<P>This Accident happen'd to <HI>Philip</HI> in the
forty &s;eventh Year of his Age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3668. Olymp. 111. 1.</NOTE> and the twenty
fifth of his Reign; during which time he was
con&s;tantly in Action, 'till by Degrees he chang'd
the whole Face of Affairs, both in <HI>Greece</HI> and
<HI>Macedonia.</HI> The Steps by which he advanc'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Cha|racter.</HI></NOTE> 
were firm and &s;ure, but withal &s;o &s;low and im|perceptible,
that he &s;eem'd to have no great
Share of Ambition; and yet in reality Nobody
had more; but Nobody had it &s;o much under
Command, nor knew &s;o well how to di&s;gui&s;e it.
<PB N="334" REF="360">
It was varni&s;h'd over, as as his Actions in ge|neral
were, with fal&s;e Colours; it had the Ap|pearance
of Ju&s;tice and Humanity, and Benefi|cence
to Mankind, in protecting the Innocent,
redre&s;&s;ing the Injur'd, and extirpating Tyranny:
But his Acts of this kind were only plau&s;ible
Methods of advancing his own Grandeur and
Authority, and of &s;ubverting the Publick Li|berty,
under a Pretence of defending it.</P>
<P>He was admirably well qualified for the part
he acted. For he had an equal Mixture of
Fire and Phlegm, which &s;erv'd to correct
each other: The fir&s;t put him upon form|ing
great De&s;igns, and the latter conducted
him in the Execution of them; &s;o that his Suc|ce&s;s
was owing chiefly to this due Tempera|ment,
which made him cautious without Fear,
and bold without Ra&s;hne&s;s. When he had ta|ken
his point, he kept it always in view, and
conceal'd it from every body el&s;e. For he
tru&s;ted no body further than was nece&s;&s;ary; he
had Favourites, but no Confidents. He was his
own Mini&s;ter, his own General, and his own
Trea&s;urer; and as he had all the Capacity, Vi|gilance
and Activity, which the&s;e &s;everal Offi|ces
requir'd, he was intirely Ma&s;ter of his own
Schemes, and of the Execution of them. Which
<HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> takes notice of, as a particular Advan|tage
that he had over the <HI>Athenians,</HI> by being
&s;o &s;ecret in his Deliberations, and &s;o uncon|troul'd
in his Actions. And the Ca&s;e was much
<PB N="335" REF="361">
the &s;ame in the other Republicks, where Mat|ters
of the mo&s;t &s;ecret Importance were can|va&s;s'd
and debated in their popular A&s;&s;emblies,
the Re&s;olutions taken upon tho&s;e Debates were
made publick, and the Hands of tho&s;e who
were to executed them, were tied up; and by
the&s;e means they generally lo&s;t their Effect, e&s;|pecially
with regard to <HI>Philip,</HI> who knew &s;o
well the Con&s;titution of <HI>Greece,</HI> and the U&s;e
that was to be made of &s;uch a Method of pro|ceeding.</P>
<P>He
look'd upon all means of attaining his
ends to be ju&s;tifiable; and he had Expedients
of all kinds, and for all Occa&s;ions. He knew
all the different ways that were to lead him to
his Mark; but he generally cho&s;e that which was
mo&s;t dark and intricate, and out of the common
Road. He lov'd Feints and Stratagems for the
Plea&s;ure of deceiving; and he valued him&s;elf
le&s;s upon the Succe&s;s of a Battle, than of a Ne|gotiation:
For which rea&s;on he &s;eldom employ'd
Force, 'till his Artifices fail'd him. And yet
when he found him&s;elf obliged to have recour&s;e
to Arms, no body behaved with more Brave|ry
and Intrepidity, nor with better Conduct.
<HI>Plutarch</HI> therefore bears too hard upon him,
when &s;peaking of him by way of compari&s;on
with <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> He &s;ays, He had none of
the principal Virtues of that Great Man, and,
among his other Defects, mentions his want of
Courage. But there does not appear to be the
<PB N="336" REF="362">
lea&s;t Foundation for this Charge; and it has
been refuted by his greate&s;t Enemy <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI>
who de&s;cribes him with his Eye out, his Col|lar-bone
broke, his Hand and his Leg maim'd;
and then adds, That he had &s;een this <HI>Philip</HI>
thus wounded from Head to Foot, &s;till ready
to throw him&s;elf into the mid&s;t of Dangers,
and to &s;acrifice the re&s;t of his Body in the fur|ther
Pur&s;uit of Glory.</P>
<P>He infu&s;ed the &s;ame Spirit into his Soldiers,
who were &s;o animated by his Example, and
&s;o inured to Action, that he could always de|pend
on them. He had al&s;o a way of gain|ing
their Affections: He would call them his
Comrades, and treat them otherwi&s;e with great
Familiarity; and he did it in &s;uch a manner,
as neither to le&s;&s;en his Authority, nor relax the
Di&s;cipline. They were grown &s;o hardy and ex|pert
under him, that the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Troops
were reckon'd at this time almo&s;t as much &s;u|perior
to the <HI>Grecians,</HI> as the <HI>Grecians</HI> were to
the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> The&s;e were the Men whom <HI>Clytus</HI>
afterwards reproach'd <HI>Alexander</HI> with, when he
told him, <HI>It was his Father's Troops, by which
he had conquer'd. Alexander</HI> was too &s;en&s;ible of
the truth of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> and it co&s;t the old Man his
Life.</P>
<P>If <HI>Philip</HI> had been equal in other re&s;pects to
what he was in the Field, he had made a glo|rious
Figure: But his Tricks and Subterfuges
and deep Di&s;&s;imulation, his gro&s;s Bribery, Trea
<PB N="337" REF="363">
chery and Breach of Faith, which make up the
main of his Character, have ca&s;t &s;uch a Shade
over his real good Qualities, that they are hardly
to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd, and have given occa&s;ion to
call even his military Virtues in que&s;tion. But
in that re&s;pect, he was undoubtedly &s;uperior to
all the Captains of his time: And he had other|wi&s;e
great Talents. He had a fine Under&s;tand|ing,
with a &s;trong and clear Judgment; great
Prudence and Fore&s;ight; great Variety of Learn|ing,
and other acquir'd Knowledge. He &s;poke
and wrote with great Ea&s;e, Propriety and Dig|nity,
but with too much Art and Subtilty: For
there was De&s;ign and In&s;incerity in every thing
he &s;aid, whether he were in je&s;t, or in earne&s;t.
He always promis'd more than he intended to
perform; and he had as little regard to his Oath,
as to his Promi&s;e. To this purpo&s;e he had a
Saying, <HI>That Children were to be cheated with
Play-things, and Men with Oaths.</HI> And yet
notwith&s;tanding this impious Maxim of his, he
made a great Shew of Religion, and it was that
which gain'd him his fir&s;t footing in <HI>Greece</HI>
in the <HI>Phocian</HI> War. Among his other Arts
of Hypocri&s;y, by which he impos'd upon the
World, we may reckon that of his being at|tended
every Morning by a Servant, to put
him in mind of his Mortality. His Friend&s;hips
were govern'd wholly by his Intere&s;t: They
were only mercenary Engagements, that he had
<PB N="338" REF="364">
enter'd into with bad Men, and for bad Ends
and when they had &s;erv'd his Purpo&s;e, he had done
with them. This was the Ca&s;e of mo&s;t of his
Agents who &s;old their Country to him; he paid
them their Price, and then di&s;carded them;
for he lov'd the Trea&s;on, but not the Traytor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Of which there was a memorable In&s;tance in
his Treatment of the two Magi&s;trates, who be|tray'd
<HI>Olynthus</HI> to him. When they found them|&s;elves
univer&s;ally &s;couted and contemn'd for that
Act of Treachery, and even by the common Sol|diers
in his own Army, they applied to him for
Protection and Redre&s;s; but he gave them a very
&s;hort An&s;wer, and a very cutting one; <HI>O!</HI> &s;aid
he, <HI>you mu&s;t not mind what &s;uch blunt Fellows
&s;ay, who call every thing by its own Name.</HI> He
had a particular Faculty of &s;etting two Friends
at variance, and by that means of getting in|to
their Confidence. And this was his main
Artifice in the carrying on his De&s;igns again&s;t
<HI>Greece,</HI> by &s;owing Jealou&s;ies, fomenting Quar|rels,
and playing one State again&s;t another; and
when he had, by the&s;e Methods, broke into
their Alliances, and &s;eparated their Intere&s;ts, the
remaining Part was not difficult. His harde&s;t
Task was with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> with whom he was
continually either fighting, or treating: And
tho' they had, 'till his time, the Reputation of
a more re&s;ined Wit than their Neighbours, and
of more Sagacity, Penetration and Attention
<PB N="339" REF="365">
to their Intere&s;ts; yet he found means to amu&s;e
and confound them, to delude and in&s;atuate
them, to corrupt and divide them.</P>
<P>He was not &s;o taken up in the pur&s;uit of
his Ambition, but that he found time for his
Plea&s;ures, wherein he indulg'd him&s;elf in a very
di&s;&s;olute and licentious manner; and in this part
of his Life, he acted openly, and without Re|&s;erve.
He lov'd Riot and Drunkenne&s;s, and
Intemperance of all kinds, and encourag'd them
&s;o much in others, that he was &s;urrounded with
a Set of lewd Para&s;ites and Debauchees, Play|ers,
Buffoons and Pantomimes, who engro&s;s'd
all his Favours, and &s;har'd all his Bounty; but
amid&s;t the&s;e Exce&s;&s;es, he had, or affected to
have, &s;ome Sen&s;e of Shame; &s;o that when he
had committed any Acts of Violence or In|ju&s;tice,
he would ea&s;ily bear Reproof, and often
repair the Injury. There was a Woman who
put her &s;elf in his way, after he had been &s;itting
long at Table, and demanded ju&s;tice of him.
He heard her Ca&s;e, and determin'd again&s;t
her. <HI>Then,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>I will appeal. What?
From your King?</HI> &s;aid <HI>Philip. And who is it you
would appeal to? To</HI> Philip, <HI>when he is &s;ober,</HI>
&s;he replied. Whereupon he examin'd the Af|&s;air
over again, and finding he had given a
wrong Judgment, made a new one in her Fa|vour.
Another Woman had long &s;olicited an
Audience of him upon a like Occa&s;ion; and be|ing
<PB N="340" REF="366">
put off from time to time, with a pretence
that he was not at lei&s;ure, &s;he could bear no
longer, but &s;aid to him, <HI>If you have not time
to do me Ju&s;tice, cea&s;e to be King.</HI> He was &s;o
far from re&s;enting her manner of reproaching
him, that he immediately redre&s;s'd her Griev|ance;
and from thenceforwards he became more
exact in giving Audience to his Subjects. There
was another In&s;tance of a good &s;ort of Man,
whom he was advis'd to bani&s;h, for having &s;po|ken
ill of him; <HI>No,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Philip, Let me con&s;ider
fir&s;t, whether I have not given him Occa&s;ion for
it.</HI> And being afterwards inform'd, that he had
never given him any Mark of his Favour, and
that he was in bad Circum&s;tances, he reliev'd
him. When the Man had ta&s;ted of his Boun|ty,
he chang'd his Note, and &s;poke as much
in his Prai&s;e: which gave occa&s;ion to <HI>Philip</HI> to
make another Reflection, <HI>That Kings have it
in their own power to be belov'd or hated.</HI> He
has given &s;everal other Proofs of his <HI>&s;wallowing
Injuries,</HI> as <HI>Longinus</HI> calls it; and &s;ome remar|ka<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">
In&s;tances of his Clemency and Forbear|an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
have been already mention'd in the Reci|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
of his Actions.</P>
<P>Thus by a Mixture of &s;ome good Qualities,
with a great many bad ones, he accompli&s;h'd
his Ends, &s;o far at lea&s;t, that he had throughly
open'd the Way to the De&s;truction of the Liber|ties
of <HI>Greece,</HI> and laid the Foundation of all his
<PB N="341" REF="367">
Son's Glory. And if the Actions of each of them
be duly weigh'd, it will be found, that <HI>Philip</HI>'s
Part was the more difficult of the two. For it
was certainly ea&s;ier to conquer <HI>A&s;ia</HI> with the
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> than to break the
Power of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who had &s;o often beat
the <HI>A&s;iaticks.</HI> Wherefore we may venture to
pronounce, That tho' <HI>Alexander</HI> was the greater
Conqueror, <HI>Philip</HI> was the greater Man. How|ever
they were both form'd for the Task they
undertook. If <HI>Philip</HI> had liv'd to pa&s;s over into
<HI>A&s;ia,</HI> his artful and deliberate Valour would
not, in all Likelihood, have had &s;o good
an Effect there, as the Heroick Ardour and
Impetuo&s;ity of his Son, which bore down
every thing that oppos'd him, and which
carried him on with &s;uch Rapidity through
the whole Body of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Empire.
But however <HI>Philip</HI> might have &s;ucceeded in
that Expedition, it &s;eems pretty extraordinary,
that he &s;hould think of entring upon it,
before he had made a more intire Conque&s;t
of <HI>Greece,</HI> which was certainly his original
Plan, and the Point, in which all his other
Views center'd: And his Succe&s;s at <HI>Cheron&ecirc;a</HI>
had given him the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aire&s;t Pro&s;pect he ever
had, of &s;ubduing the whole Country. It had
put the <HI>Athenians</HI> and the <HI>Thebans</HI> &s;o far in
his Power, that they were expecting every
Hour to have his Yoke impos'd on them.
<PB N="342" REF="368">
As to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> tho' they had avoided en|tering
into the Quarrel, it is hardly to be &s;up|pos'd
they would tamely have &s;ubmitted to him
After the Battle, he wrote them an haughty Let|ter,
to try how they would reli&s;h his Authority<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
But in An&s;wer to it, their King <HI>Archidamus</HI> the
Son of <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> &s;ent him word, <HI>That if he mea|&s;ur'd
his Shadow, he would find it no bigger after
his Victory, than it was before.</HI> The An&s;wer they
&s;ent him to another Letter of the &s;ame kind,
was, <HI>Diony&s;ius to Corinth.</HI> However, they were
not in a Condition &s;ingly to make Head again&s;t
him; and the other &s;ubordinate States were &s;o
weak and di&s;united, and withal &s;o indolent and
remi&s;s, that there was no immediate Appearance
of forming any con&s;iderable League again&s;t
him. But whether he thought the <HI>Grecians</HI> were
&s;till too formidable for him, to act in open De|fiance
of them; and that his Shew of Mode|ration
and Humanity, and his Arts of In&s;inua|tion,
were ea&s;ier and &s;afer Methods of gaining
further Ground upon them; or whether he
really contented him&s;elf with the having hum|bled
them, and with the Honour of pre&s;iding
in their Great Council, and of leading them
forth to Battle under the Title of their General,
it is certain, that he did not pur&s;ue his fir&s;t
Scheme of Conque&s;t again&s;t them, nor make
u&s;e of the Advantages, that he had then in his
Hands. He had &s;till le&s;t them in a Condition
<PB N="343" REF="369">
to recover their former Liberty, if they had
had any Remains of their former Spirit: But
that was &s;o broken and decay'd, that they be|came
an ea&s;y Prey to his Succe&s;&s;ors.</P>
