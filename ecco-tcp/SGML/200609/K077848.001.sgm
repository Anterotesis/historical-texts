<HEAD>AN INQUIRY INTO THE NATURE AND CAUSES OF THE WEALTH OF NATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>INTRODUCTION AND PLAN OF THE WORK.</P>
<P>THE annual labour of every nation is the fund which ori|ginally &s;upplied it with all the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life which it annually con&s;umes, and which con&s;i&s;t always, either in the immediate produce of that labour, or in what is purcha&s;ed with that produce from other nations.</P>
<P>ACCORDING therefore, as this produce, or what is purcha&s;ed with it, bears a greater or &s;maller proportion to the number of tho&s;e who are to con&s;ume it, the nation will be better or wor&s;e &s;upplied with all the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies for which it has occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT this proportion mu&s;t in every nation be regulated by two different circum&s;tances; fir&s;t, by the &s;kill, dexterity and judgment
<PB N="2" REF="13">
with which labour is generally applied in it; and, &s;econdly, by the proportion between the number of tho&s;e who are employed in u&s;eful labour, and that of tho&s;e who are not &s;o employed. What|ever be the &s;oil, climate, or extent of territory of any particular nation, the abundance or &s;cantine&s;s of its annual &s;upply mu&s;t, in that particular &s;ituation, depend upon tho&s;e two circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE abundance or &s;cantine&s;s of this &s;upply too &s;eems to de|pend more upon the former of tho&s;e two circum&s;tances than upon the latter. Among the &s;avage nations of hunters and fi&s;hers, every individual who is able to work, is more or le&s;s employed in u&s;eful labour, and endeavours to provide, as well as he can, the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life, for him&s;elf, and &s;uch of his family or tribe as are either too old, or too young, or too infirm to go a hunting and fi&s;hing. Such nations, however, are &s;o mi&s;erably poor, that, from mere want, they are frequently reduced, or, at lea&s;t, think them&s;elves reduced, to the nece&s;&s;ity &s;ometimes of directly de|&s;troying, and &s;ometimes of abandoning their infants, their old peo|ple, and tho&s;e afflicted with lingering di&s;ea&s;es, to peri&s;h with hunger, or to be devoured by wild bea&s;ts. Among civilized and thriving nations, on the contrary, though a great number of people do not labour at all, many of whom confume the produce of ten times, frequently of a hundred times more labour than the greater part of tho&s;e who work; yet the produce of the whole labour of the &s;ociety is &s;o great, that all are often abundantly &s;upplied, and a workman, even of the lowe&s;t and poore&s;t order, if he is frugal and indu&s;trious, may enjoy a greater &s;hare of the nece&s;&s;aries and con|veniencies of life than it is po&s;&s;ible for any &s;avage to acquire.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;es of this improvement, in the productive powers of labour, and the order, according to which its produce is naturally
<PB N="3" REF="14">
di&s;tributed among the different ranks and conditions of men in the &s;ociety, make the &s;ubject of the Fir&s;t Book of this Inquiry.</P>
<P>WHATEVER be the actual &s;tate of the &s;kill, dexterity, and judg|ment with which labour is applied in any nation, the abundance or &s;cantine&s;s of its annual &s;upply, mu&s;t depend, during the con|tinuance of that &s;tate, upon the proportion between the number of tho&s;e who are annually employed in u&s;eful labour, and that of tho&s;e who are not &s;o employed. The number of u&s;eful and productive labourers, it will hereafter appear, is every where in proportion to the quantity of capital &s;tock which is employed in &s;etting them to work, and to the particular way in which it is &s;o employed. The Second Book, therefore, treats of the nature of capital &s;tock, of the manner in which it is gradually accumulated, and of the different quantities of labour which it puts into motion, according to the different ways in which it is employed.</P>
<P>NATIONS tolerably well advanced as to &s;kill, dexterity, and judg|ment, in the application of labour, have followed very different plans in the general conduct or direction of it; and tho&s;e plans have not all been equally favourable to the greatne&s;s of its produce. The policy of &s;ome nations has given extraordinary encouragement to the indu&s;try of the country; that of others to the indu&s;try of towns. Scarce any nation has dealt equally and impartially with every &s;ort of indu&s;try. Since the downfal of the Roman empire, the policy of Europe has been more favourable to arts, manufac|tures, and commerce, the indu&s;try of towns; than to agriculture, the indu&s;try of the country. The circum&s;tances which &s;eem to have introduced and e&s;tabli&s;hed this policy are explained in the Third Book.</P>
<P>THOUGH tho&s;e different plans were, perhaps, fir&s;t introduced by the private intere&s;ts and prejudices of particular orders of men, with|out
<PB N="4" REF="15">
any regard to, or fore&s;ight of, their con&s;equences upon the general welfare of the &s;ociety; yet they have given occa&s;ion to very different theories of political oeconomy; of which &s;ome magnify the importance of that indu&s;try which is carried on in towns, others of that which is carried on in the country. Tho&s;e theories have had a con&s;iderable influence, not only upon the opinions of men of learn|ing, but upon the public conduct of princes and &s;overeign &s;tates. I have endeavoured, in the Fourth Book, to explain, as fully and di&s;|tinctly as I can, tho&s;e different theories, and the principal effects which they have produced in different ages and nations.</P>
<P>IN what has con&s;i&s;ted the revenue of the great body of the people, or what is the nature of tho&s;e funds which, in different ages and nations, have &s;upplied their annual con&s;umption, is treated of in the&s;e four fir&s;t Books. The Fifth and la&s;t Book treats of the revenue of the &s;overeign, or commonwealth. In this Book I have endeavoured to &s;how; fir&s;t, what are the nece&s;&s;ary expences of the &s;overeign, or commonwealth; which of tho&s;e expences ought to be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole &s;ociety; and which of them, by that of &s;ome particular part only, or of &s;ome particular members of the &s;ociety: &s;econdly, what are the different methods in which the whole &s;ociety may be made to contribute towards defraying the expences incumbent on the whole &s;ociety, and what are the principal advantages and inconveniencies of each of tho&s;e methods: and, thirdly and la&s;tly, what are the rea&s;ons and cau&s;es which have induced almo&s;t all modern governments to mort|gage &s;ome part of this revenue, or to contract debts, and what have been the effects of tho&s;e debts upon the real wealth, the annual produce of the land and labour of the &s;ociety.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of the Divi&s;ion of Labour.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE greate&s;t improvements in the productive powers of La|bour, and the greater part of the &s;kill, dexterity, and judg|ment with which it is any where directed, or applied, &s;eem to have been the effects of the divi&s;ion of labour.</P>
<P>THE effects of the divi&s;ion of labour, in the general bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ociety, will be more ea&s;ily under&s;tood, by con&s;idering in what manner it operates in &s;ome particular manufactures. It is com|monly &s;uppo&s;ed to be carried furthe&s;t in &s;ome very trifling ones; not perhaps that it really is carried further in them than in others of more importance: but in tho&s;e trifling manufactures which are de&s;tined to &s;upply the &s;mall wants of but a &s;mall number of people, the whole number of workmen mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;mall; and tho&s;e employed in every different branch of the work can often be collected into the &s;ame workhou&s;e, and placed at once under the view of the &s;pec|tator. In tho&s;e great manufactures, on the contrary, which are de&s;tined to &s;upply the great wants of the great body of the people, every different branch of the work employs &s;o great a number of
<PB N="6" REF="17">
workmen, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to collect them all into the &s;ame work|hou&s;e. We can &s;eldom &s;ee more, at one time, than tho&s;e employed in one &s;ingle branch. Though in them, therefore, the work may really be divided into a much greater number of parts, than in tho&s;e of a more trifling nature, the divi&s;ion is not near &s;o obvious, and has accordingly been much le&s;s ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufac|ture; but one in which the divi&s;ion of labour has been very often taken notice of, the trade of the pin-maker; a workman not edu|cated to this bu&s;ine&s;s (which the divi&s;ion of labour has rendered a di&s;tinct trade), nor acquainted with the u&s;e of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the &s;ame divi&s;ion of labour has probably given occa&s;ion), could &s;carce, perhaps, with his utmo&s;t indu&s;try, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the way in which this bu&s;ine&s;s is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number of branches, of which the greater part are likewi&s;e peculiar trades. One man draws out the wire, another &s;traights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for re|ceiving the head; to make the head requires two or three di&s;tinct operations; to put it on, is a peculiar bu&s;ine&s;s, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by it&s;elf to put them into the paper; and the important bu&s;ine&s;s of making a pin is, in this manner, di|vided into about eighteen di&s;tinct operations, which in &s;ome manu|factories are all performed by di&s;tinct hands, though in others the &s;ame man will &s;ometimes perform two or three of them. I have &s;een a &s;mall manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed, and where &s;ome of them con&s;equently performed two or three di&s;tinct operations. But though they were very poor, and there|fore but indifferently accommodated with the nece&s;&s;ary machinery, they could, when they exerted them&s;elves, make among them about
<PB N="7" REF="18">
twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four thou&s;and pins of a middling &s;ize. Tho&s;e ten per&s;ons, there|fore, could make among them upwards of forty-eight thou&s;and pins in a day. Each per&s;on, therefore, making a tenth part of forty|eight thou&s;and pins, might be con&s;idered as making four thou&s;and eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought &s;eparately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar bu&s;ine&s;s, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thou&s;and eight hundredth part of what they are at pre&s;ent capable of per|forming, in con&s;equence of a proper divi&s;ion and combination of their different operations.</P>
<P>IN every other art and manufacture, the effects of the divi&s;ion of labour are &s;imilar to what they are in this very trifling one; though, in many of them, the labour can neither be &s;o much &s;ub|divided, nor reduced to &s;o great a &s;implicity of operation. The di|vi&s;ion of labour, however, &s;o far as it can be introduced, occa&s;ions, in every art, a proportionable increa&s;e of the productive powers of labour. The &s;eparation of different trades and employments from one another, &s;eems to have taken place, in con&s;equence of this advantage. This &s;eparation too is generally carried furthe&s;t in tho&s;e countries which enjoy the highe&s;t degree of indu&s;try and im|provement; what is the work of one man, in a rude &s;tate of &s;ociety, being generally that of &s;everal, in an improved one. In every im|proved &s;ociety, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer; the manufacturer nothing but a manufacturer. The labour too which is nece&s;&s;ary to produce any one complete manufacture, is almo&s;t always divided among a great number of hands. How many different trades are employed in each branch of the linen and woollen manufactures, from the growers of the flax and the wool, to the

bleachers and &s;moothers of the linen, or to the dyers and dre&s;&s;ers of the cloth! The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit of &s;o many &s;ubdivi&s;ions of labour, nor of &s;o complete a &s;eparation of one bu&s;ine&s;s from another, as manufactures. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate &s;o entirely, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the trade of the carpenter is commonly &s;eparated from that of the &s;mith. The &s;pinner is almo&s;t always a di&s;tinct per&s;on from the weaver; but the ploughman, the harrower, the &s;ower of the &s;eed, and the reaper of the corn, are often the &s;ame. The occa&s;ions for tho&s;e different &s;orts of labour returning with the different &s;ea&s;ons of the year, it is impo&s;&s;ible that one man &s;hould be con&s;tantly employ|ed in any one of them. This impo&s;&s;ibility of making &s;o complete and entire a &s;eparation of all the different branches of labour em|ployed in agriculture, is perhaps the rea&s;on why the improve|ment of the productive powers of labour in this art, does not always keep pace with their improvement in manufactures. The mo&s;t opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their neighbours in agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they are commonly more di&s;tingui&s;hed by their &s;uperiority in the latter than in the former. Their lands are in general better cultivated, and having more la|bour and expence be&s;towed upon them, produce more, in propor|tion to the extent and natural fertility of the ground. But the &s;uperiority of produce is &s;eldom much more than in proportion to the &s;uperiority of labour and expence. In agriculture, the labour of the rich country is not always much more productive than that of the poor; or, at lea&s;t, it is never &s;o much more productive, as it commonly is in manufactures. The corn of the rich country, there|fore, will not always, in the &s;ame degree of goodne&s;s, come cheaper to market than that of the poor. The corn of Poland, in the &s;ame degree of goodne&s;s, is as cheap as that of France, notwith&s;tanding the &s;uperior opulence and improvement of the latter country. The corn of France is, in the corn provinces, fully as good, and in mo&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="20">
years nearly about the &s;ame price with the corn of England, though, in opulence and improvement, France is perhaps in|ferior to England. The lands of England, however, are better cultivated than tho&s;e of France, and the lands of France are &s;aid to be much better cultivated than tho&s;e of Poland. But though the poor country, notwith&s;tanding the inferiority of its culti|vation, can, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, rival the rich in the cheapne&s;s and goodne&s;s of its corn, it can pretend to no &s;uch competition in its manufactures; at lea&s;t if tho&s;e manufactures &s;uit the &s;oil, climate, and &s;ituation of the rich country. The &s;ilks of France are better and cheaper than tho&s;e of England, becau&s;e the &s;ilk manufacture does not &s;uit the climate of England. But the hardware and the coar&s;e woollens of England are beyond all compari&s;on &s;uperior to tho&s;e of France, and much cheaper too in the &s;ame degree of goodne&s;s. In Poland there are &s;aid to be &s;carce any manufactures of any kind, a few of tho&s;e coar&s;er hou&s;ehold manufactures ex|cepted, without which no country can well &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS great increa&s;e of the quantity of work, which the &s;ame number of people are capable of performing, in con&s;equence of the divi&s;ion of labour, is owing to three different circum&s;tances; fir&s;t, to the increa&s;e of dexterity in every particular workman; &s;econdly, to the &s;aving of the time which is commonly lo&s;t in pa&s;&s;ing from one &s;pecies of work to another; and la&s;tly, to the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour, and enable one man to do the work of many.</P>
<P>FIRST, the improvement of the dexterity of the workman ne|ce&s;&s;arily increa&s;es the quantity of the work he can perform, and the divi&s;ion of labour, by reducing every man's bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ome one &s;imple operation, and by making this operation the &s;ole em|ployment of his life, nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;es very much the dexterity
<PB N="10" REF="21">
of the workman. A common &s;mith, who, though accu&s;tomed to handle the hammer, has never been u&s;ed to make nails, if upon &s;ome particular occa&s;ion he is obliged to attempt it, will &s;carce, I am a&s;&s;ured, be able to make above two or three hundred nails in a day, and tho&s;e too very bad ones. A &s;mith who has been accu&s;|tomed to make nails, but who&s;e &s;ole or principal bu&s;ine&s;s has not been that of a nailer, can &s;eldom with his utmo&s;t diligence make more than eight hundred or a thou&s;and nails in a day. I have &s;een &s;everal boys under twenty years of age who had never exer|ci&s;ed any other trade but that of making nails, and who, when they exerted them&s;elves, could make, each of them, upwards of two thou&s;and three hundred nails in a day. The making of a nail, however, is by no means one of the &s;imple&s;t operations. The &s;ame per&s;on blows the bellows, &s;tirs or mends the fire as there is occa&s;ion, heats the iron, and forges every part of the nail: In forging the head too he is obliged to change his tools. The different operations into which the making of a pin, or of a metal button, is &s;ubdivided, are all of them much more &s;imple, and the dex|terity of the per&s;on, of who&s;e life it has been the &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s to perform them, is u&s;ually much greater. The rapidity with which &s;ome of the operations of tho&s;e manufactures are performed, exceeds what the human hand could, by tho&s;e who had never &s;een them, be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of acquiring.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, the advantage which is gained by &s;aving the time commonly lo&s;t in pa&s;&s;ing from one &s;ort of work to another, is much greater than we &s;hould at fir&s;t view be apt to imagine it. It is impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s very quickly from one kind of work to an|other, that is carried on in a different place, and with quite differ|ent tools. A country weaver, who cultivates a &s;mall farm, mu&s;t lo&s;e a good deal of time in pa&s;&s;ing from his loom to the field, and from the field to his loom. When the two trades can be car|ried
<PB N="11" REF="22">
on in the &s;ame workhou&s;e, the lo&s;s of time is no doubt much le&s;s. It is even in this ca&s;e, however, very con&s;iderable. A man commonly &s;aunters a little in turning his hand from one &s;ort of employment to another. When he fir&s;t begins the new work he is &s;eldom very keen and hearty; his mind, as they &s;ay, does not go to it, and for &s;ome time he rather trifles than applies to good purpo&s;e. The habit of &s;auntering and of indolent carele&s;s ap|plication, which is naturally, or rather nece&s;&s;arily acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change his work and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in twenty different ways almo&s;t every day of his life; renders him almo&s;t always &s;loth|ful and lazy, and incapable of any vigorous application even on the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ions. Independent, therefore, of his de|ficiency in point of dexterity, this cau&s;e alone mu&s;t always reduce con&s;iderably the quantity of work which he is capable of perform|ing.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, and la&s;tly, every body mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible how much labour is facilitated and abridged by the application of proper ma|chinery. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to give any example. I &s;hall, therefore, only ob&s;erve that the invention of all tho&s;e machines by which labour is &s;o much facilitated and abridged, &s;eems to have been originally owing to the divi&s;ion of labour. Men are much more likely to di&s;cover ea&s;ier and readier methods of attaining any object when the whole attention of their minds is directed towards that &s;ingle object, than when it is di&s;&s;ipated among a great variety of things. But in con&s;equence of the divi&s;ion of labour, the whole of every man's attention comes naturally to be directed towards &s;ome one very &s;imple object. It is naturally to be expected, there|fore, that &s;ome one or other of tho&s;e who are employed in each particular branch of labour &s;hould &s;oon find out ea&s;ier and readier methods of performing their own particular work wherever the
<PB N="12" REF="23">
nature of it admits of &s;uch improvement. A great part of the machines employed in tho&s;e manufactures in which labour is mo&s;t &s;ubdivided, were originally the inventions of common workmen, who, being each of them employed in &s;ome very &s;imple operation, naturally turned their thoughts towards finding out ea&s;ier and readier methods of performing it. Whoever has been much accu&s;tomed to vi&s;it &s;uch manufactures, mu&s;t frequently have been &s;hown very pretty machines, which were the inventions of common workmen in order to facilitate and quicken their own particular part of the work. In the fir&s;t fire-engines, a boy was con&s;tantly employed to open and &s;hut alternately the communi|cation between the boiler and the cylinder, according as the pi&s;ton either a&s;cended or de&s;cended. One of tho&s;e boys, who loved to play with his companions, ob&s;erved that, by tying a &s;tring from the handle of the valve, which opened this communication, to another part of the machine, the valve would open and &s;hut without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and leave him at liberty to divert him&s;elf with his play-fellows. One of the greate&s;t improvements that has been made upon this machine, &s;ince it was fir&s;t invented, was in this manner the di&s;covery of a boy who wanted to &s;ave his own labour.</P>
<P>ALL the improvements in machinery, however, have by no means been the inventions of tho&s;e who had occa&s;ion to u&s;e the machines. Many improvements have been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the machines, when to make them became the bu&s;ine&s;s of a peculiar trade; and &s;ome by that of tho&s;e who are called philo&s;ophers or men of &s;peculation, who&s;e trade it is, not to do any thing, but to ob&s;erve every thing; and who, upon that account, are often capable of combining together the powers of the mo&s;t di&s;tant and di&s;&s;imilar objects. In the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, philo&s;ophy or &s;peculation becomes, like every other em|ployment,
<PB N="13" REF="24">
the principal or &s;ole trade and occupation of a particular cla&s;s of citizens. Like every other employment too, it is &s;ub|divided into a great number of different branches, each of which affords occupation to a peculiar tribe or cla&s;s of philo&s;ophers; and this &s;ubdivi&s;ion of employment in philo&s;ophy, as well as in every other bu&s;ine&s;s, improves dexterity and &s;aves time. Each indi|vidual becomes more expert in his own peculiar branch, more work is done upon the whole, and the quantity of &s;cience is con|&s;iderably increa&s;ed by it.</P>
<P>IT is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different arts, in con&s;equence of the divi&s;ion of labour, which occa&s;ions in a well governed &s;ociety that univer&s;al opulence which extends it&s;elf to the lowe&s;t ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to di&s;po&s;e of beyond what he him&s;elf has occa&s;ion for; and every other workman being exactly in the &s;ame &s;ituation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the &s;ame thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He &s;upplies them abundantly with what they have occa&s;ion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occa&s;ion for, and a general plenty diffu&s;es it&s;elf through all the different ranks of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>OBSERVE the accommodation of the mo&s;t common artificer or day-labourer in a civilized and thriving country, and you will perceive that the number of people of who&s;e indu&s;try a part, though but a &s;mall part, has been employed in procuring him this accommodation exceeds all computation. The woollen coat, for example, which covers the day-labourer, as coar&s;e and rough as it may appear, is the produce of the joint labour of a great multitude of workmen. The &s;hepherd, the &s;orter of the wool,
<PB N="14" REF="25">
the wool-comber or carder, the dyer, the &s;cribbler, the &s;pinner, the weaver, the fuller, the dre&s;&s;er, with many others, mu&s;t all join their different arts in order to complete even this homely production. How many merchants and carriers, be&s;ides, mu&s;t have been employed in tran&s;porting the materials from &s;ome of tho&s;e workmen to others who often live in a very di&s;tant part of the country! how much commerce and navigation in particu|lar, how many &s;hip-builders, &s;ailors, &s;ail-makers, rope-makers, mu&s;t have been employed in order to bring together the different drugs made u&s;e of by the dyer, which often come from the remote&s;t corners of the world! What a variety of labour too is nece&s;&s;ary in order to produce the tools of the meane&s;t of tho&s;e workmen! To &s;ay nothing of &s;uch complicated machines as the &s;hip of the &s;ailor, the mill of the fuller, or even the loom of the weaver, let us con&s;ider only what a variety of labour is requi&s;ite in order to form that very &s;imple machine, the &s;hears with which the &s;hepherd clips the wool. The miner, the builder of the furnace for &s;melt|ing the ore, the feller of the timber, the burner of the charcoal to be made u&s;e of in the &s;melting hou&s;e, the brick-maker, the brick-layer, the workmen who attend the furnace, the mill|wright, the forger, the &s;mith, mu&s;t all of them join their differ|ent arts in order to produce them. Were we to examine, in the &s;ame manner, all the different parts of his dre&s;s and hou&s;ehold furniture, the coar&s;e linen &s;hirt which he wears next his &s;kin, the &s;hoes which cover his feet, the bed which he lies on, and all the different parts which compo&s;e it, the kitchen grate at which he prepares his victuals, the coals which he makes u&s;e of for that purpo&s;e, dug from the bowels of the earth, and brought to him perhaps by a long &s;ea and a long land carriage, all the other uten&s;ils of his kitchen, all the furniture of his table, the knives and forks, the earthen or pewter plates upon which he &s;erves up and divides his victuals, the different hands employed in preparing his bread
<PB N="15" REF="26">
and his beer, the gla&s;s window which lets in the heat and the light, and keeps out the wind and the rain, with all the knowledge and art requi&s;ite for preparing that beautiful and happy invention, without which the&s;e northern parts of the world could &s;carce have afforded a very comfortable habitation, together with the tools of all the different workmen employed in producing tho&s;e different conveniencies; if we examine, I &s;ay, all the&s;e things, and con&s;ider what a variety of labour is employed about each of them, we &s;hall be &s;en&s;ible that without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and co-operation of many thou&s;ands, the very meane&s;t per&s;on in a civilized country could not be provided, even according to what we very fal&s;ely imagine the ea&s;y and &s;imple manner in which he is commonly accommodated. Com|pared, indeed, with the more extravagant luxury of the great, his accommodation mu&s;t no doubt appear extremely &s;imple and ea&s;y; and yet it may be true perhaps that the accommodation of an European prince does not always &s;o much exceed that of an in|du&s;trious and frugal pea&s;ant, as the accommodation of the latter exceeds that of many an African king, the ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of the lives and liberties of ten thou&s;and naked &s;avages.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the Principle which gives Occa&s;ion to the Divi&s;ion of Labour.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS divi&s;ion of labour, from which &s;o many advantages are derived, is not originally the effect of any human wi&s;dom, which fore&s;ees and intends that general opulence to which it gives occa&s;ion. It is the nece&s;&s;ary, though very &s;low and gradual con|&s;equence of a certain propen&s;ity in human nature which has in view no &s;uch exten&s;ive utility; the propen&s;ity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.</P>
<P>WHETHER this propen&s;ity be one of tho&s;e original principles in human nature, of which no further account can be given; or whether, as &s;eems more probable, it be the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the faculties of rea&s;on and &s;peech, it belongs not to our pre&s;ent &s;ubject to enquire. It is common to all men, and to be found in no other race of animals, which &s;eem to know neither this nor any other &s;pecies of contracts. Two greyhounds in running down the &s;ame hare, have &s;ometimes the appearance of acting in &s;ome &s;ort of concert. Each turns her towards his companion, or endeavours to intercept her when his companion turns her towards him&s;elf. This, however, is not the effect of any contract, but of the acci|dental concurrence of their pa&s;&s;ions in the &s;ame object at that particular time. Nobody ever &s;aw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another with another dog. Nobody ever &s;aw one animal by its ge&s;tures and natural cries &s;ignify to another, this is mine, that yours; I am willing to give this for that. When an animal wants to obtain &s;omething either of a man or of another animal, it has no other means of per&s;ua&s;ion but to gain the favour of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ervice it requires. A puppy fawns upon its dam, and a &s;paniel endeavours by a thou&s;and
<PB N="17" REF="28">
attractions to engage the attention of its ma&s;ter who is at dinner, when it wants to be fed by him. Man &s;ometimes u&s;es the &s;ame arts with his brethren, and when he has no other means of en|gaging them to act according to his inclinations, endeavours by every &s;ervile and fawning attention to obtain their good will. He has not time, however, to do this upon every occa&s;ion. In civi|lized &s;ociety he &s;tands at all times in need of the co-operation and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of great multitudes, while his whole life is &s;carce &s;uf|ficient to gain the friend&s;hip of a few per&s;ons. In almo&s;t every other race of animals each individual, when it is grown up to maturity, is intirely independant, and in its natural &s;tate has oc|ca&s;ion for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of no other living creature. But man has almo&s;t con&s;tant occa&s;ion for the help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail, if he can intere&s;t their &s;elf-love in his favour, and &s;hew them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them. Whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind, propo&s;es to do this. Give me that which I want, and you &s;hall have this which you want, is the meaning of every &s;uch offer; and it is in this manner that we obtain from one an|other the far greater part of tho&s;e good offices which we &s;tand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own intere&s;t. We addre&s;s our&s;elves not to their humanity but to their &s;elf-love, and never talk to them of our own nece&s;&s;ities but of their advantages. Nobody but a beggar chu&s;es to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow citi|zens. Even a beggar does not depend upon it entirely. The charity of well di&s;po&s;ed people, indeed, &s;upplies him with the whole fund of his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. But though this principle ultimately provides him with all the nece&s;&s;aries of life which he has occa&s;ion for, it neither does nor can provide him with them as he has
<PB N="18" REF="29">
occa&s;ion for them. The greater part of his occa&s;ional wants are &s;upplied in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e of other people, by treaty, by barter, and by purcha&s;e. With the money which one man gives him he purcha&s;es food. The old cloaths which another be&s;tows upon him he exchanges for other old cloaths which &s;uit him better, or for lodging, or for food, or for money, with which he can buy either food, cloaths, or lodging, as he has occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>AS it is by treaty, by barter, and by purcha&s;e, that we obtain from one another the greater part of tho&s;e mutual good offices which we &s;tand in need of, &s;o it is this &s;ame trucking di&s;po&s;ition which originally gives occa&s;ion to the divi&s;ion of labour. In a tribe of hunters or &s;hepherds a particular per&s;on makes bows and arrows, for example, with more readine&s;s and dexterity than any other. He frequently exchanges them for cattle or for veni&s;on with his companions; and he finds at la&s;t that he can in this man|ner get more cattle and veni&s;on, than if he him&s;elf went to the field to catch them. From a regard to his own intere&s;t, therefore, the making of bows and arrows grows to be his chief bu&s;ine&s;s, and he becomes a &s;ort of armourer. Another excels in making the frames and covers of their little huts or moveable hou&s;es. He is accu&s;tomed to be of u&s;e in this way to his neighbours, who reward him in the &s;ame manner with cattle and with veni&s;on, till at la&s;t he finds it his intere&s;t to dedicate him&s;elf intirely to this employment, and to become a &s;ort of hou&s;e-carpenter. In the &s;ame manner a third becomes a &s;mith or a brazier, a fourth a tan|ner or dre&s;&s;er of hides or &s;kins, the principal part of the cloathing of &s;avages. And thus the certainty of being able to exchange all that &s;urplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own con&s;umption, for &s;uch parts of the produce of other mens labour as he may have occa&s;ion for, encourages every man to apply him&s;elf to a particular occupation, and to cultivate
<PB N="19" REF="30">
and bring to perfection whatever talent or genius he may po&s;&s;e&s;s for that particular &s;pecies of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE difference of natural talents in different men is, in reality, much le&s;s than we are aware of; and the very different genius which appears to di&s;tingui&s;h men of different profe&s;&s;ions, when grown up to maturity, is not upon many occa&s;ions &s;o much the cau&s;e, as the effect of the divi&s;ion of labour. The difference between the mo&s;t di&s;&s;imilar characters, between a philo&s;opher and a common &s;treet porter, for example, &s;eems to ari&s;e not &s;o much from nature, as from habit, cu&s;tom, and education. When they came into the world, and for the fir&s;t &s;ix or eight years of their exi&s;tence, they were perhaps very much alike, and neither their parents nor play-fellows could perceive any remarkable difference. About that age or &s;oon after, they come to be employed in very different occupations. The difference of talents comes then to be taken notice of, and widens by degrees, till at la&s;t the vanity of the philo&s;opher is willing to acknowledge &s;carce any re&s;em|blance. But without the di&s;po&s;ition to truck, barter and ex|change, every man mu&s;t have procured to him&s;elf every nece&s;&s;ary and conveniency of life which he wanted. All mu&s;t have had the &s;ame duties to perform, and the &s;ame work to do, and there could have been no &s;uch difference of employment as could alone give occa&s;ion to any great difference of talents.</P>
<P>AS it is this di&s;po&s;ition which forms that difference of talents, &s;o remarkable among men of different profe&s;&s;ions, &s;o it is this &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition which renders that difference u&s;eful. Many tribes of animals acknowledged to be all of the &s;ame &s;pecies, derive from nature a much more remarkable di&s;tinction of genius, than what, antecedent to cu&s;tom and education, appears to take place among men. By nature a philo&s;opher is not in genius and di&s;po&s;ition
<PB N="20" REF="31">
half &s;o different from a &s;treet porter, as a ma&s;tiff is from a grey|hound, or a greyhound from a &s;paniel, or this la&s;t from a &s;hep|herd's dog. Tho&s;e different tribes of animals, however, tho' all of the &s;ame &s;pecies, are of &s;carce any u&s;e to one another. The &s;trength of the ma&s;tiff is not, in the lea&s;t, &s;upported either by the &s;wiftne&s;s of the greyhound, or by the &s;agacity of the &s;paniel, or by the docility of the &s;hepherd's dog. The effects of tho&s;e different geniu&s;es and talents, for want of the power or di&s;po&s;ition to barter and exchange, cannot be brought into a common &s;tock, and do not in the lea&s;t contribute to the better accommodation and conveniency of the &s;pecies. Each animal is &s;till obliged to &s;upport and defend it&s;elf, &s;eparately and independantly, and derives no &s;ort of advantage from that variety of talents with which nature has di&s;tingui&s;hed its fellows. Among men, on the con|trary, the mo&s;t di&s;&s;imilar geniu&s;es are of u&s;e to one another; the different produces of their re&s;pective talents, by the general di&s;|po&s;ition to truck, barter, and exchange, being brought, as it were, into a common &s;tock, where every man may purcha&s;e whatever part of the produce of other men's talents he has oc|ca&s;ion for.</P>

<P>THERE are &s;ome &s;orts of indu&s;try, even of the lowe&s;t kind, which can be carried on no where but in a great town. A porter, for example, can find employment and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in no other place. A village is by much too narrow a &s;phere for him; even an ordinary market town is &s;carce large enough to afford him con&s;tant occupation. In the lone hou&s;es and very &s;mall vil|lages which are &s;cattered about in &s;o de&s;art a country as the highlands of Scotland, every farmer mu&s;t be butcher, baker and brewer for his own family. In &s;uch &s;ituations we can &s;carce expect to find even a &s;mith, a carpenter, or a ma&s;on, within le&s;s than twenty miles of another of the &s;ame trade. The &s;cattered families that live at eight or ten miles di&s;tance from the neare&s;t of them, mu&s;t learn to perform them&s;elves a great number of little pieces of work, for which, in more populous countries, they would call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e workmen. Country workmen are almo&s;t every where obliged to apply them&s;elves to all the differ|ent branches of indu&s;try that have &s;o much affinity to one another
<PB N="22" REF="33">
as to be employed about the &s;ame &s;ort of materials. A country carpenter deals in every &s;ort of work that is made of wood: a country &s;mith in every &s;ort of work that is made of iron. The former is not only a carpenter, but a joiner, a cabinet-maker, and even a carver in wood, as well as a wheel-wright, a plough|wright, a cart and waggon maker. The employments of the latter are &s;till more various. It is impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be &s;uch a trade as even that of a nailer in the remote and inland parts of the highlands of Scotland. Such a workman at the rate of a thou&s;and nails a day, and three hundred working days in the year, will make three hundred thou&s;and nails in the year. But in &s;uch a &s;ituation it would be impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;po&s;e of one thou&s;and, that is, of one day's work in the year.</P>
<P>As by means of water-carriage a more exten&s;ive market is opened to every &s;ort of indu&s;try than what land-carriage alone can afford it, &s;o it is upon the &s;ea coa&s;t, and along the banks of navi|gable rivers, that indu&s;try of every kind naturally begins to &s;ub|divide and improve it&s;elf; and it is frequently not till a long time after that tho&s;e improvements extend them&s;elves to the inland parts of the country. A broad-wheeled waggon, attended by two men and drawn by eight hor&s;es, in about &s;ix weeks time carries and brings back between London and Edinburgh near four ton weight of goods. In about the &s;ame time a &s;hip navigated by &s;ix or eight men, and &s;ailing between the ports of London and Leith, fre|quently carries and brings back two hundred ton weight of goods. Six or eight men, therefore, by the help of water-carriage, can carry and bring back in the &s;ame time the &s;ame quantity of goods between London and Edinburgh as fifty broad-wheeled waggons, attended by a hundred men, and drawn by four hundred hor&s;es. Upon two hundred tons of goods, therefore, carried by the cheape&s;t land-carriage from London to Edinburgh, there mu&s;t be charged
<PB N="23" REF="34">
the maintenance of a hundred men for three weeks, and both the maintenance, and, what is nearly equal to the maintenance, the wear and tear of four hundred hor&s;es as well as of fifty great waggons. Whereas upon the &s;ame quantity of goods carried by water, there is to be charged only the maintenance of &s;ix or eight men, and the wear and tear of a &s;hip of two hundred tons burden, together with the value of the &s;uperior ri&s;k or the difference of the in&s;urance between land and water-carriage. Were there no other communication between tho&s;e two places, therefore, but by land-carriage, as no goods could be tran&s;ported from the one to the other except &s;uch who&s;e price was very con&s;iderable in proportion to their weight, they could carry on but a &s;mall part of that commerce which is at pre&s;ent carried on between them, and con|&s;equently could give but a &s;mall part of that encouragement which they at pre&s;ent mutually afford to each other's indu&s;try. There could be little or no commerce of any kind between the di&s;tant parts of the world. What goods could bear the expence of land-carriage between London and Calcutta? Or if there was any &s;o precious as to be able to &s;upport this expence, with what &s;afety could they be tran&s;ported through the territories of &s;o many barbarous nations? Tho&s;e two cities, however, at pre&s;ent carry on together a very con&s;iderable commerce, and, by mutually affording a market, give a good deal of encouragement to each other's indu&s;try.</P>
<P>SINCE &s;uch, therefore, are the advantages of water carriage, it is natural that the fir&s;t improvements of art and indu&s;try &s;hould be made where this conveniency opens the whole world for a market to the produce of every &s;ort of labour, and that they &s;hould always be much later in extending them&s;elves into the in|land parts of the country. The inland parts of the country can for a long time have no other market for the greater part of their
<PB N="24" REF="35">
goods, but the country which lies round about them, and &s;epa|rates them from the &s;ea coa&s;t, and the great navigable rivers. The extent of their market, therefore, mu&s;t for a long time be in proportion to the riches and populou&s;ne&s;s of that country, and con&s;equently their improvement mu&s;t always be po&s;terior to the improvement of that country. In our North American colonies the plantations have con&s;tantly followed either the &s;ea coa&s;t or the banks of the navigable rivers, and have &s;carce any where ex|tended them&s;elves to any con&s;iderable di&s;tance from both.</P>
<P>THE nations that, according to the be&s;t authenticated hi&s;tory, appear to have been fir&s;t civilized, were tho&s;e that dwelt round the coa&s;t of the Mediterranean &s;ea. That &s;ea, by far the greate&s;t inlet that is known in the world, having no tides, nor con&s;equently any waves except &s;uch as are cau&s;ed by the wind only, was, by the &s;moothne&s;s of its &s;urface, as well as by the multitude of its i&s;lands, and the proximity of its neighbouring &s;hores, extreamly favourable to the infant navigation of the world; when from their ignorance of the compa&s;s, men were afraid to quit the view of the coa&s;t, and from the imperfection of the art of &s;hip-building, to abandon them&s;elves to the boi&s;terous waves of the ocean. To pa&s;s beyond the pillars of Hercules, that is, to &s;ail out of the &s;treights of Gibraltar, was, in the antient world, long con&s;idered as a mo&s;t wonderful and dangerous exploit of navigation. It was late before even the Phenicians and Carthaginians, the mo&s;t &s;kilful navigators and &s;hip-builders of tho&s;e old times, attempted it, and they were for a long time the only nations that did at|tempt it.</P>
<P>OF all the countries on the coa&s;t of the Mediterranean &s;ea, Egypt &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t in which either agriculture or manufactures were cultivated and improved to any con&s;iderable
<PB N="25" REF="36">
degree. Upper Egypt extends it&s;elf no where above a few miles from the Nile, and in Lower Egypt that great river breaks it&s;elf into many different canals, which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a little art, &s;oem to have afforded a communication by water carriage, not only between all the great towns, but between all the con|&s;iderable villages, and even to many farm hou&s;es in the country; nearly in the &s;ame manner as the Rhine and the Mae&s;e do in Holland at pre&s;ent. The extent and ea&s;ine&s;s of this inland navigation was probably one of the principal cau&s;es of the early improvement of Egypt.</P>
<P>THE improvements in agriculture and manufactures &s;eem like|wi&s;e to have been of very great antiquity in the provinces of Bengal in the Ea&s;t Indies, and in &s;ome of the ea&s;tern provinces of China; though the great extent of this antiquity is not authenticated by any hi&s;tories of who&s;e authority we, in this part of the world, are well a&s;&s;ured. In Bengal the Ganges and &s;everal other great rivers break them&s;elves into many canals in the &s;ame manner as the Nile does in Egypt. In the ea&s;tern provinces of China too &s;everal great rivers form, by their different branches, a multitude of canals, and by communicating with one another afford an inland naviga|tion much more exten&s;ive than that either of the Nile or the Ganges, or perhaps than both of them put together. It is re|markable that neither the antient Egyptians, nor the Indians, nor the Chine&s;e, encouraged foreign commerce, but &s;eem all to have derived their great opulence from this inland navigation.</P>
<P>ALL the inland parts of Africa, and all that part of A&s;ia which lies any con&s;iderable way north of the Euxine and Ca&s;pian &s;eas, the ancient Scythia, the modern Tartary and Siberia, &s;eem in all ages of the world to have been in the &s;ame barbarous and uncivilized &s;tate in which we find them at pre&s;ent. The &s;ea of
<PB N="26" REF="37">
Tartary is the frozen ocean which admits of no navigation, and though &s;ome of the greate&s;t rivers in the world run through that country, they are at too great a di&s;tance from one another to carry commerce and communication through the greater part of it. There are in Africa none of tho&s;e great inlets &s;uch as the Baltic and Adriatic &s;eas in Europe, the Mediterranean and Eux|ine &s;eas in both Europe and A&s;ia, and the gulphs of Arabia, Per&s;ia, India, Bengal and Siam, in A&s;ia, to carry maritime com|merce into the interior parts of that great continent: and the great rivers of Africa are at too great a di&s;tance from one another to give occa&s;ion to any con&s;iderable inland navigation. The com|merce be&s;ides which any nation can carry on by means of a river which does not break it&s;elf into any great number of branches or canals, and which runs into another territory before it reaches the &s;ea, can never be very con&s;iderable; becau&s;e it is always in the power of the nations who po&s;&s;e&s;s that other territory to ob&s;truct the communication between the upper country and the &s;ea. The navi|gation of the Danube is of very little u&s;e to the different &s;tates of Bavaria, Au&s;tria and Hungary, in compari&s;on of what it would be if any one of them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole of its cour&s;e till it falls into the Black &s;ea.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Of the Origin and U&s;e of Money.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN the divi&s;ion of labour has been once thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed, it is but a very &s;mall part of a man's wants which the produce of his own labour can &s;upply. He &s;upplies the far greater part of them by exchanging that &s;urplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own con|&s;umption, for &s;uch parts of the produce of other men's labour as he has occa&s;ion for. Every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes in &s;ome mea&s;ure a merchant, and the &s;ociety it&s;elf grows to be what is properly a commercial &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BUT when the divi&s;ion of labour fir&s;t began to take place, this power of exchanging mu&s;t frequently have been very much clogged and embarra&s;&s;ed in its operations. One man, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, has more of a certain commodity than he him&s;elf has occa&s;ion for, while another has le&s;s. The former con&s;equently would be glad to di&s;po&s;e of, and the latter to purcha&s;e, a part of this &s;uperfluity. But if this latter &s;hould chance to have nothing that the former &s;tands in need of, no exchange can be made between them. The butcher has more meat in his &s;hop than he him&s;elf can con&s;ume, and the brewer and the baker would each of them be willing to purcha&s;e a part of it. But they have nothing to offer in exchange, except the different productions of their re&s;pec|tive trades, and the butcher is already provided with all the bread and beer which he has immediate occa&s;ion for. No exchange can, in this ca&s;e, be made between them. He cannot be their merchant, nor they his cu&s;tomers; and they are all of them thus mutually le&s;s &s;erviceable to one another. In order to avoid the inconveniency
<PB N="28" REF="39">
of &s;uch &s;ituations, every prudent man in every period of &s;ociety, after the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the divi&s;ion of labour, mu&s;t naturally have endeavoured to manage his affairs in &s;uch a manner, as to have at all times by him, be&s;ides the peculiar produce of his own indu&s;try, a certain quantity of &s;ome one commodity or other, &s;uch as he imagined few people would be likely to refu&s;e in exchange for the produce of their indu&s;try.</P>
<P>MANY different commodities, it is probable, were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively both thought of and employed for this purpo&s;e. In the rude ages of &s;ociety, cattle are &s;aid to have been the common in&s;tru|ment of commerce; and, though they mu&s;t have been a mo&s;t in|convenient one, yet in old times we find things were frequently valued according to the number of cattle which had been given in exchange for them. The armour of Diomed, &s;ays Homer, co&s;t only nine oxen; but that of Glaucus co&s;t a hundred oxen. Salt is &s;aid to be the common in&s;trument of commerce and ex|changes in Aby&s;&s;mia; a &s;pecies of &s;hells in &s;ome parts of the coa&s;t of India; dried cod at Newfoundland; tobacco in Vir|ginia; &s;ugar in &s;ome of our We&s;t India colonies; hides or dre&s;&s;ed leather in &s;ome other countries; and there is at this day a village in Scotland where it is not uncommon, I am told, for a workman to carry nails in&s;tead of money to the baker's &s;hop or the alehou&s;e.</P>
<P>IN all countries, however, men &s;eem at la&s;t to have been deter|mined by irre&s;i&s;table rea&s;ons to give the preference, for this em|ployment, to metals above every other commodity. Metals can not only be kept with as little lo&s;s as any other commodity, &s;carce any thing being le&s;s peri&s;hable than they are, but they can likewi&s;e, without any lo&s;s, be divided into any number of parts, as by fu&s;ion tho&s;e parts can ea&s;ily be reunited again; a
<PB N="29" REF="40">
quality which no other equally durable commodities po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which more than any other quality renders them fit to be the in&s;truments of commerce and circulation. The man who wanted to buy &s;alt, for example, and had nothing but cattle to give in exchange for it, mu&s;t have been obliged to buy &s;alt to the value of a whole ox, or a whole &s;heep at a time. He could &s;eldom buy le&s;s than this, becau&s;e what he was to give for it could &s;eldom be divided without lo&s;s; and if he had a mind to buy more, he mu&s;t, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, have been obliged to buy double or triple the quantity, the value, to wit, of two or three oxen, or of two or three &s;heep. If, on the contrary, in&s;tead of &s;heep or oxen, he had metals to give in exchange for it, he could ea&s;ily proportion the quantity of the metal to the preci&s;e quantity of the commodity which he had immediate occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>DIFFERENT metals have been made u&s;e of by different nations for this purpo&s;e. Iron was the common in&s;trument of com|merce among the antient Spartans; copper among the antient Romans; and gold and &s;ilver among all rich and commercial nations.</P>
<P>THOSE metals &s;eem originally to have been made u&s;e of for this purpo&s;e in rude bars without any &s;tamp or coinage. Thus we are told by Pliny, upon the authority of one Remeus an antient author, that, till the time of Servius Tullius, the Romans had no coined money, but made u&s;e of un&s;tamped bars of copper to purcha&s;e whatever they had occa&s;ion for. The&s;e rude bars, there|fore, performed at this time the function of money.</P>
<P>THE u&s;e of metals in this rude &s;tate was attended with two very con&s;iderable inconveniencies; fir&s;t, with the trouble of weighing them; and, &s;econdly, with the trouble of a&s;&s;aying them.
<PB N="30" REF="41">
In the precious metals, where a &s;mall difference in the quantity makes a great difference in the value, even the bu&s;ine&s;s of weigh|ing, with proper exactne&s;s, requires at lea&s;t very accurate weights and &s;cales. The weighing of gold in particular is an operation of &s;ome nicety. In the coar&s;er metals, indeed, where a &s;mall error would be of little con&s;equence, le&s;s accuracy would, no doubt, be nece&s;&s;ary. Yet we &s;hould find it exce&s;&s;ively trouble&s;ome if every time a poor man had occa&s;ion either to buy or &s;ell a farthing's worth of goods, he was obliged to weigh the farthing. The ope|ration of a&s;&s;aying is &s;till more difficult, &s;till more tedious, and, unle&s;s a part of the metal is fairly melted in the crucible, with proper di&s;&s;olvents, any conclu&s;ion that can be drawn from it, is extreamly uncertain. Before the in&s;titution of coined money, however, unle&s;s they went through this tedious and difficult ope|ration, people mu&s;t always have been liable to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t frauds and impo&s;itions, and in&s;tead of a pound weight of pure &s;ilver, or pure copper, might receive, in exchange for their goods, an adulterated compo&s;ition of the coar&s;e&s;t and cheape&s;t materials, which had, however, in their outward appearance, been made to re&s;emble tho&s;e metals. To prevent &s;uch abu&s;es, to facilitate ex|changes, and thereby to encourage all &s;orts of indu&s;try and com|merce, it has been found nece&s;&s;ary, in all countries that have made any con&s;iderable advances towards improvement, to affix a publick &s;tamp upon certain quantities of &s;uch particular metals, as were in tho&s;e countries commonly made u&s;e of to purcha&s;e goods. Hence the origin of coined money, and of tho&s;e publick offices called mints; in&s;titutions exactly of the &s;ame nature with tho&s;e of the aulnagers and &s;tampma&s;ters of woollen and linen cloth. All of them are equally meant to a&s;certain, by means of a publick &s;tamp, the quantity and uniform goodne&s;s of tho&s;e different commodities when brought to market.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="42">
THE fir&s;t publick &s;tamps of this kind that were affixed to the current metals, &s;eem in many ca&s;es to have been intended to a&s;certain, what it was both mo&s;t difficult and mo&s;t important to a&s;certain, the goodne&s;s or finene&s;s of the metal, and to have re&s;embled the &s;terling mark which is at pre&s;ent affixed to plate and bars of &s;ilver, or the Spani&s;h mark which is &s;ometimes affixed to ingots of gold, and which being &s;truck only upon one &s;ide of the piece, and not covering the whole &s;urface, a&s;certains the fine|ne&s;s, but not the weight of the metal. Abraham weighs to Ephron the four hundred &s;hekels of &s;ilver which he had agreed to pay for the field of Machpelah. They are &s;aid however to be the current money of the merchant, and yet are received by weight and not by tale, in the &s;ame manner as ingots of gold and bars of &s;ilver are at pre&s;ent. The revenues of the antient Saxon kings of England are &s;aid to have been paid, not in money but in kind, that is, in victuals and provi&s;ions of all &s;orts. William the conqueror introduced the cu&s;tom of paying them in money. This money, however, was, for a long time, received at the ex|chequer, by weight and not by tale.</P>
<P>THE inconveniency and difficulty of weighing tho&s;e metals with exactne&s;s gave occa&s;ion to the in&s;titution of coins, of which the &s;tamp, covering entirely both &s;ides of the piece and &s;ometimes the edges too, was &s;uppo&s;ed to a&s;certain not only the finene&s;s, but the weight of the metal. Such coins, therefore, were received by tale as at pre&s;ent, without the trouble of weighing.</P>
<P>THE denominations of tho&s;e coins &s;eem originally to have expre&s;&s;ed the weight or quantity of metal contained in them. In the time of Servius Tullius, who fir&s;t coined money at Rome, the Roman As or pondo contained a Roman pound of good copper. It was divided in the &s;ame manner as our Troyes
<PB N="32" REF="43">
pound, into twelve ounces, each of which contained a real ounce of good copper. The Engli&s;h pound &s;terling, in the time of Edward I. contained a pound, Tower weight, of &s;ilver of a known finene&s;s. The Tower pound &s;eems to have been &s;omething more than the Roman pound, and &s;omething le&s;s than the Troyes pound. This la&s;t was not introduced into the mint of Eng|land till the 18th of Henry VIII. The French livre contained in the time of Charlemagne a pound, Troyes weight, of &s;ilver of a known finene&s;s. The fair of Troyes in Champaign was at that time frequented by all the nations of Europe, and the weights and mea&s;ures of &s;o famous a market were generally known and e&s;teemed. The Scots money pound contained, from the time of Alexander the fir&s;t to that of Robert Bruce, a pound of &s;ilver of the &s;ame weight and finene&s;s with the Engli&s;h pound &s;terling. Engli&s;h, French and Scots pennies too, contained all of them originally a real pennyweight of &s;ilver, the twentieth part of an ounce, and the two hundred and fortieth part of a pound. The &s;hilling too &s;eems originally to have been the denomination of a weight. <HI>When wheat is at twelve &s;hillings the quarter,</HI> &s;ays an antient &s;tatute of Henry III. <HI>then wa&s;tel bread of a farthing &s;hall weigh eleven &s;hillings and four pence.</HI> The pro|portion, however, between the &s;hilling and either the penny on the one hand, or the pound on the other, &s;eems not to have been &s;o con&s;tant and uniform as that between the penny and the pound. During the fir&s;t race of the kings of France, the French &s;ou or &s;hilling appears upon different occa&s;ions to have contained five, twelve, twenty, forty, and forty-eight pennies. Among the antient Saxons a &s;hilling appears at one time to have contained only five pennies, and it is not improbable that it may have been as variable among them as among their neighbours, the antient Franks. From the time of Charlemagne among the French, and from that of William the conqueror among the Engli&s;h, the proportion between the pound, the &s;hilling, and the penny, &s;eems
<PB N="33" REF="44">
to have been uniformly the &s;ame as at pre&s;ent, though the value of each has been very different. For in every country of the world, I believe, the avarice and inju&s;tice of princes and &s;overeign &s;tates, abu&s;ing the confidence of their &s;ubjects, have by degrees dimini&s;hed the real quantity of metal which had been originally contained in their coins. The Roman As, in the latter ages of the Republick, was reduced to the twenty fourth part of its original value, and, in&s;tead of weighing a pound, came to weigh only half an ounce. The Engli&s;h pound and penny contain at pre&s;ent about a third only; the Scots pound and penny about a thirty-&s;ixth; and the French pound and penny about a &s;ixty-&s;ixth part of their original value. By means of tho&s;e ope|rations the princes and &s;overeign &s;tates which performed them were enabled, in appearance, to pay their debts and to fulfil their engagements with a &s;maller quantity of &s;ilver than would otherwi&s;e have been requi&s;ite. It was indeed in appearance only; for their creditors were really defrauded of a part of what was due to them. All other debtors in the &s;tate were allowed the &s;ame privilege, and might pay with the &s;ame nominal &s;um of the new and deba&s;ed coin whatever they had borrowed in the old. Such operations, there|fore, have always proved favourable to the debtor, and ruinous to the creditor, and have &s;ometimes produced a greater and more univer&s;al revolution in the fortunes of private per&s;ons, than could have been occa&s;ioned by a very great publick calamity.</P>
<P>IT is in this manner that money has become in all civilized nations the univer&s;al in&s;trument of commerce, by the intervention of which goods of all kinds are bought and &s;old, or exchanged for one another.</P>
<P>WHAT are the rules which men naturally ob&s;erve in exchanging them either for money or for one another, I &s;hall now proceed
<PB N="34" REF="45">
to examine. The&s;e rules determine what may be called the relative or exchangeable value of goods.</P>
<P>THE word VALUE, it is to be ob&s;erved, has two different mean|ings, and &s;ometimes expre&s;&s;es the utility of &s;ome particular object, and &s;ometimes the power of purcha&s;ing other goods which the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of that object conveys. The one may be called, ''value in ''u&s;e;'' the other, ''value in exchange.'' The things which have the greate&s;t value in u&s;e have frequently little or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, tho&s;e which have the greate&s;t value in exchange have frequently little or no value in u&s;e. Nothing is more u&s;eful than water: but it will purcha&s;e &s;carce any thing; &s;carce any thing can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has &s;carce any value in u&s;e; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in ex|change for it.</P>
<P>IN order to inve&s;tigate the principles which regulate the exchange|able value of commodities, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew,</P>
<P>FIRST, what is the real mea&s;ure of this exchangeable value; or, wherein con&s;i&s;ts the real price of all commodities.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, what are the different parts of which this real price is compo&s;ed or made up.</P>
<P>AND, la&s;tly, what are the different circum&s;tances which &s;ome|times rai&s;e &s;ome or all of the&s;e different parts of price above, and &s;ometimes &s;ink them below their natural or ordinary rate; or, what are the cau&s;es which &s;ometimes hinder the market price, that is, the actual price, of commodities, from coinciding ex|actly with what may be called their natural price.</P>
<P>I SHALL endeavour to explain, as fully and di&s;tinctly as I can, tho&s;e three &s;ubjects in the three following chapters, for which I
<PB N="35" REF="46">
mu&s;t very earne&s;tly entreat both the patience and attention of the reader: his patience in order to examine a detail which may per|haps in &s;ome places appear unnece&s;&s;arily tedious; and his attention in order to under&s;tand what may, perhaps, after the fulle&s;t expli|cation which I am capable of giving of it, appear &s;till in &s;ome degree ob&s;cure. I am always willing to run &s;ome hazard of being tedious in order to be &s;ure that I am per&s;picuous; and after taking the utmo&s;t pains that I can to be per&s;picuous, &s;ome ob&s;curity may &s;till appear to remain upon a &s;ubject which is in its own nature extremely ab&s;tracted.</P>

<P>EVERY man is rich or poor according to the degree in which he can afford to enjoy the nece&s;&s;aries, conveniencies, and amu&s;ements of human life. But after the divi&s;ion of labour has once thoroughly taken place, it is but a very &s;mall part of the&s;e with which a man's own labour can &s;upply him. The far greater part of them he mu&s;t derive from the labour of other people, and he mu&s;t be rich or poor according to the quantity of that labour which he can command, or which he can afford to purcha&s;e. The value of any commodity, therefore, to the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it and who means not to u&s;e or con&s;ume it him&s;elf, but to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purcha&s;e or command. Labour, therefore, is the real mea&s;ure of the exchangeable value of all commodities.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="47">
THE real price of every thing, what every thing really co&s;ts to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of ac|quiring it. What every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it, and who wants to di&s;po&s;e of it or exchange it for &s;omething el&s;e, is the toil and trouble which it can &s;ave to him|&s;elf, and which it can impo&s;e upon other people. What is bought with money or with goods is purcha&s;ed by labour as much as what we acquire by the toil of our own body. That money or tho&s;e goods indeed &s;ave us this toil. They contain the value of a certain quantity of labour which we exchange for what is &s;uppo&s;ed at the time to contain the value of an equal quantity. Labour was the fir&s;t price, the original purcha&s;e money that was paid for all things. It was not by gold or by &s;ilver, but by labour, that all the wealth of the world was originally purcha&s;ed; and its value, to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it and who want to exchange it for &s;ome new productions, is preci&s;ely equal to the quantity of labour which it can enable them to purcha&s;e or command.</P>
<P>BUT though labour be the real mea&s;ure of the exchangeable value of all commodities, it is not that by which their value is commonly e&s;timated. It is often difficult to a&s;certain the pro|portion between two different quantities of labour. The time &s;pent in two different &s;orts of work will not always alone determine this proportion. The different degrees of hard&s;hip endured, and of ingenuity exerci&s;ed mu&s;t likewi&s;e be taken into account. There may be more labour in an hour's hard work than in two hours ea&s;y bu&s;ine&s;s; or in an hour's application to a trade which it co&s;t ten years labour to learn, than in a month's indu&s;try at an ordinary and obvious employment. But it is not ea&s;y to find any accurate mea&s;ure either of hard&s;hip or ingenuity. In exchanging indeed the different productions of different &s;orts of labour for one another, &s;ome allowance is commonly made for both. It is adju&s;ted, how|ever,
<PB N="37" REF="48">
not by any accurate mea&s;ure, but by the higgling and bargaining of the market, according to that &s;ort of rough equality which, though not exact, is &s;ufficient for carrying on the bu&s;ine&s;s of common life.</P>
<P>EVERY commodity be&s;ides, is more frequently exchanged for, and thereby compared with, other commodities than with labour. It is more natural, therefore, to e&s;timate its exchangeable value by the quantity of &s;ome other commodity than by that of the labour which it can purcha&s;e. The greater part of people too under&s;tand better what is meant by a quantity of a particular commodity, than by a quantity of labour. The one is a plain palpable object; the other an ab&s;tract notion, which, though it can be made &s;ufficiently intelligible, is not altogether &s;o natural and obvious.</P>
<P>BUT when barter cea&s;es, and money has become the common in&s;trument of commerce, every particular commodity is more frequently exchanged for money than for any other commodity. The butcher &s;eldom carries his beef or his mutton to the baker, or the brewer, in order to exchange them for bread or for beer; but he carries them to the market, where he exchanges them for money, and afterwards exchanges that money for bread and for beer. The quantity of money which he gets for them regulates too the quantity of bread and beer which he can afterwards pur|cha&s;e. It is more natural and obvious to him, therefore, to e&s;ti|mate their value by the quantity of money, the commodity for which he immediately exchanges them, than by that of bread and beer, the commodities for which he can exchange them only by the intervention of another commodity; and rather to &s;ay that his butcher's meat is worth threepence or fourpence a pound, than that it is worth three or four pounds of bread, or three or four quarts of &s;mall beer. Hence it comes to pa&s;s that the exchange|able
<PB N="38" REF="49">
value of every commodity is more frequently e&s;timated by the quantity of money, than by the quantity either of labour or of any other commodity which can be had in exchange for it.</P>
<P>GOLD and &s;ilver, however, like every other commodity, vary in their value, are &s;ometimes cheaper and &s;ometimes dearer, &s;ometimes of ea&s;ier and &s;ometimes of more difficult purcha&s;e. The quantity of labour which any particular quantity of them can purcha&s;e or command, or the quantity of other goods which it will exchange for, depends always upon the fertility or barrenne&s;s of the mines which happen to be known about the time when &s;uch exchanges are made. The di&s;covery of the abundant mines of America reduced, in the &s;ixteenth century, the value of gold and &s;ilver in Europe to about a third of what it had been before. As it co&s;t le&s;s labour to bring tho&s;e metals from the mine to the market, &s;o when they were brought there they could purcha&s;e or command le&s;s labour; and this revolution in their value, though perhaps the greate&s;t, is by no means the only one of which hi&s;tory gives &s;ome account. But as a mea&s;ure of quantity, &s;uch as the natural foot, fathom, or handful, which is continually varying in its own quan|tity, can never be an accurate mea&s;ure of the quantity of other things; &s;o a commodity which is it&s;elf continually varying in its own value, can never be an accurate mea&s;ure of the value of other commodities. Equal quantities of labour mu&s;t at all times and places be of equal value to the labourer. He mu&s;t always lay down the &s;ame portion of his ea&s;e, his liberty, and his happine&s;s. The price which he pays mu&s;t always be the &s;ame, whatever may be the quan|tity of goods which he receives in return for it. Of the&s;e, indeed, it may &s;ometimes purcha&s;e a greater and &s;ometimes a &s;maller quantity; but it is their value which varies, not that of the labour which pur|cha&s;es them. At all times and places that is dear which it is difficult to come at, or which it co&s;ts much labour to acquire; and that cheap
<PB N="39" REF="50">
which is to be had ea&s;ily, or with very little labour. Labour alone therefore, never varying in its own value, is alone the ultimate and real &s;tandard by which the value of all commodities can at all times and places be e&s;timated and compared. It is their real price; money is their nominal price only.</P>
<P>BUT though equal quantities of labour are always of equal value to the labourer, yet to the per&s;on who employs him they appear &s;ometimes to be of greater and &s;ometimes of &s;maller value. He purcha&s;es them &s;ometimes with a greater and &s;ome|times with a &s;maller quantity of goods, and to him the price of labour &s;eems to vary like that of all other things. It appears to him dear in the one ca&s;e, and cheap in the other. In reality, however, it is the goods which are cheap in the one ca&s;e, and dear in the other.</P>
<P>IN this popular &s;en&s;e, therefore, Labour, like commodities, may be &s;aid to have a real and a nominal price. Its real price may be &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in the quantity of the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life which are given for it; its nominal price, in the quantity of money. The labourer is rich or poor, is well or ill rewarded, in proportion to the real, not to the nominal price of his labour.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tinction between the real and the nominal price of com|modities and labour, is not a matter of mere &s;peculation, but may &s;ometimes be of con&s;iderable u&s;e in practice. The &s;ame real price is always of the &s;ame value; but on account of the variations in the value of gold and &s;ilver, the &s;ame nominal price is &s;ometimes of very different values. When a landed e&s;tate, therefore, is &s;old with a re&s;ervation of a perpetual rent, if it is intended that this rent &s;hould always be of the &s;ame value, it is of importance to the family in who&s;e favour it is re&s;erved, that it &s;hould not con&s;i&s;t in
<PB N="40" REF="51">
a particular &s;um of money. Its value would in this ca&s;e be liable to variations of two different kinds; fir&s;t, to tho&s;e which ari&s;e from the different quantities of gold and &s;ilver which are contained at different times in coin of the &s;ame denomination; and, &s;econdly, to tho&s;e which ari&s;e from the different values of equal quantities of gold and &s;ilver at different times.</P>
<P>PRINCES and &s;overeign &s;tates have frequently fancied that they had a temporary intere&s;t to dimini&s;h the quantity of pure metal contained in their coins; but they &s;eldom have fancied that they had any to augment it. The quantity of metal contained in the coins, I believe, of all nations has, accordingly, been almo&s;t con|tinually dimini&s;hing, and hardly ever augmenting. Such variations therefore tend almo&s;t always to dimini&s;h the value of a money rent.</P>
<P>THE di&s;covery of the mines of America dimini&s;hed the value of gold and &s;ilver in Europe. This diminution, it is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, though, I apprehend, without any certain proof, is &s;till going on gradually, and is likely to continue to do &s;o far a long time. Upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, therefore, &s;uch variations are more likely to dimini&s;h, than to augment the value of a money rent, even though it &s;hould be &s;tipulated to be paid, not in &s;uch a quantity of coined money of &s;uch a denomination, (in &s;o many pounds &s;terling, for example) but in &s;o many ounces either of pure &s;ilver, or of &s;ilver of a certain &s;tandard.</P>
<P>THE rents which have been re&s;erved in corn have pre&s;erved their value much better than tho&s;e which have been re&s;erved in money, even where the denomination of the coin has not been altered. By the 18th of Elizabeth it was enacted, That a third of the rent of all college lea&s;es &s;hould be re&s;erved in corn, to be paid, either in kind, or according to the current prices at the neare&s;t publick
<PB N="41" REF="52">
market. The money ari&s;ing from this corn rent, though originally but a third of the whole, is in the pre&s;ent times, according to Doctor Black&s;tone, commonly near double of what ari&s;es from the other two-thirds. The old money rents of colleges mu&s;t, according to this account, have &s;unk almo&s;t to a fourth part of their antient value; or are worth little more than a fourth part of the corn which they were formerly worth. But &s;ince the reign of Philip and Mary the denomination of the Engli&s;h coin has undergone little or no alteration, and the &s;ame number of pounds, &s;hillings and pence, have contained very nearly the &s;ame quantity of pure &s;ilver. This degradation, therefore, in the value of the money rents of colleges, has ari&s;en altogether from the degradation in the value of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>WHEN the degradation in the value of &s;ilver is combined with the diminution of the quantity of it contained in the coin of the &s;ame denomination, the lo&s;s is frequently &s;till greater. In Scotland, where the denomination of the coin has undergone much greater alterations than it ever did in England, and in France, where it has undergone &s;till greater than it ever did in Scotland, &s;ome antient rents, originally of con&s;iderable value, have in this manner been reduced almo&s;t to nothing.</P>
<P>EQUAL quantities of labour will at di&s;tant times be purcha&s;ed more nearly with equal quantities of corn, the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the labourer, than with equal quantities of gold and &s;ilver, or perhaps of any other commodity. Equal quantities of corn, therefore, will, at di&s;tant times, be more nearly of the &s;ame real value, or enable the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to purcha&s;e or command more nearly the &s;ame quantity of the labour of other people. They will do this, I &s;ay, more nearly than equal quantities of almo&s;t any other commodity; for even equal quantities of corn will not do it exactly. The &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence of the labourer, or the real price of labour, as I &s;hall
<PB N="42" REF="53">
endeavour to &s;how hereafter, is very different upon different occa|&s;ions; more liberal in a &s;ociety advancing to opulence than in one that is &s;tanding &s;till; and in one that is &s;tanding &s;till than in one that is going backwards. Every other commodity, how|ever, will at any particular time purcha&s;e a greater or &s;maller quantity of labour in proportion to the quantity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which it can purcha&s;e at that time. A rent therefore re&s;erved in corn is liable only to the variations in the quantity of labour which a certain quantity of corn can purcha&s;e. But a rent re&s;erved in any other commodity is liable, not only to the variations in the quantity of labour which any particular quantity of corn can purcha&s;e, but to the variations in the quantity of corn which can be purcha&s;ed by any particular quantity of that commodity.</P>
<P>THOUGH the real value of a corn rent, it is to be ob&s;erved however, varies much le&s;s from century to century than that of a money rent, it varies much more from year to year. The money price of labour, as I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how hereafter, does not fluctuate from year to year with the money price of corn, but &s;eems to be every where accommodated, not to the temporary or occa&s;ional, but to the average or ordinary price of that nece&s;&s;ary of life. The average or ordinary price of corn again is regulated, as I &s;hall likewi&s;e endeavour to &s;how hereafter, by the value of &s;ilver, by the richne&s;s or barrenne&s;s of the mines which &s;upply the market with that metal, or by the quantity of labour which mu&s;t be em|ployed, and con&s;equently of corn which mu&s;t be con&s;umed, in order to bring any particular quantity of it from the mine to the market. But the value of &s;ilver, though it &s;ometimes varies greatly from century to century, &s;eldom varies much from year to year, but frequently continues the &s;ame or very nearly the &s;ame for half a century or a century together. The ordinary or average money price of corn, therefore, may, during &s;o long a period,
<PB N="43" REF="54">
continue the &s;ame or very nearly the &s;ame too, and along with it the money price of labour, provided, at lea&s;t, the &s;ociety con|tinues, in other re&s;pects, in the &s;ame or nearly in the &s;ame condition. In the mean time the temporary and occa&s;ional price of corn, may frequently be double, one year, of what it had been the year before, or fluctuate from five and twenty to fifty &s;hillings the quarter, for example. But when corn is at the latter price, not only the nominal, but the real value of a corn rent will be double of what it is when at the former, or will command double the quantity either of labour or of the greater part of other commodities; the money price of labour, and along with it that of mo&s;t other things, continuing the &s;ame during all the&s;e fluc|tuations.</P>
<P>LABOUR, therefore, it appears evidently, is the only univer&s;al, as well as the only accurate mea&s;ure of value, or the only &s;tandard by which we can compare the values of different commodities at all times and at all places. We cannot e&s;timate, it is allowed, the real value of different commodities from century to century by the quantities of &s;ilver which were given for them. We cannot e&s;timate it from year to year by the quantities of corn. By the quantities of labour we can, with the greate&s;t accuracy, e&s;ti|mate it both from century to century and from year to year. From century to century, corn is a better mea&s;ure than &s;ilver, becau&s;e, from century to century, equal quantities of corn will command the &s;ame quantity of labour more nearly than equal quantities of &s;ilver. From year to year, on the contrary, &s;ilver is a better mea&s;ure than corn, becau&s;e equal quantities of it will more nearly command the &s;ame quantity of labour.</P>
<P>BUT though in e&s;tabli&s;hing perpetual rents, or even in letting very long lea&s;es, it may be of u&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h between real and
<PB N="44" REF="55">
nominal price; it is of none in buying and &s;elling, the more common and ordinary tran&s;actions of human life.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time and place the real and the nominal price of all commodities are exactly in proportion to one another. The more or le&s;s money you get for any commodity, in the London market, for example, the more or le&s;s labour it will at that time and place enable you to purcha&s;e or command. At the &s;ame time and place, therefore, money is the exact mea&s;ure of the real exchangeable value of all commodities. It is &s;o, however, at the &s;ame time and place only.</P>
<P>THOUGH at di&s;tant places, there is no regular proportion between the real and the money price of commodities, yet the merchant who carries goods from the one to the other has nothing to con&s;ider but their money price, or the difference between the quantity of &s;ilver for which he buys them, and that for which he is likely to &s;ell them. Half an ounce of &s;ilver at Canton in China may command a greater quantity both of labour and of the nece&s;|&s;aries and conveniencies of life, than an ounce at London. A commodity, therefore, which &s;ells for half an ounce of &s;ilver at Canton may there be really dearer, of more real importance to the man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it there, than one which &s;ells for an ounce at London to the man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it at London. If a London merchant, however, can buy at Canton for half an ounce of &s;ilver, a commodity which he can afterwards &s;ell at London for an ounce, he gains a hundred per cent by the bargain ju&s;t as much as if an ounce of &s;ilver was at London exactly of the &s;ame value as at Canton. It is of no importance to him that half an ounce of &s;ilver at Canton would have given him the command of more labour and of a greater quantity of the nece&s;&s;aries and conve|niencies of life than an ounce can do at London. An ounce at
<PB N="45" REF="56">
London will always give him the command of double the quantity of all the&s;e which half an ounce could have done there, and this is preci&s;ely what he wants.</P>
<P>As it is the nominal or money price of goods, therefore, which finally determines the prudence or imprudence of all purcha&s;es and fales, and thereby regulates almo&s;t the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of common life in which price is concerned, we cannot wonder that it &s;hould have been &s;o much more attended to than the real price.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch a work as this, however, it may &s;ometimes be of u&s;e to compare the different real values of a particular commodity at different times and places, or the different degrees of power over the labour of other people which it may, upon different occa&s;ions, have given to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it. We mu&s;t in this ca&s;e com|pare, not &s;o much the different quantities of &s;ilver for which it was commonly &s;old, as the different quantities of labour which tho&s;e different quantities of &s;ilver could have purcha&s;ed. But the current prices of labour at di&s;tant times and places can &s;carce ever be known with any degree of exactne&s;s. Tho&s;e of corn, though they have in few places been regularly recorded, are in general better known and have been more frequently taken notice of by hi&s;torians and other writers. We mu&s;t generally, therefore, con|tent our&s;elves with them, not as being always exactly in the &s;ame proportion as the current prices of labour, but as being the neare&s;t approximation which can commonly be had to that proportion. I &s;hall hereafter have occa&s;ion to make &s;everal compari&s;ons of this kind.</P>
<P>IN the progre&s;s of indu&s;try, commercial nations have found it convenient to coin &s;everal different metals into money; gold for larger payments, &s;ilver for purcha&s;es of moderate value, and copper
<PB N="46" REF="57">
or &s;ome other coar&s;e metal, for tho&s;e of &s;till &s;maller con&s;ideration. They have always, however, con&s;idered one of tho&s;e metals as more peculiarly the mea&s;ure of value than any of the other two; and this preference &s;eems generally to have been given to the metal which they happened fir&s;t to make u&s;e of as the in&s;trument of commerce. Having once begun to u&s;e it as their &s;tandard, which they mu&s;t have done when they had no other money, they have gene|rally continued to do &s;o even when the nece&s;&s;ity was not the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THE Romans are &s;aid to have had nothing but copper money till within five years before the fir&s;t Punic war, when they fir&s;t began to coin &s;ilver. Copper, therefore, appears to have con|tinued always the mea&s;ure of value in that republick. At Rome all accounts appear to have been kept, and the value of all e&s;tates to have been computed either in <HI>A&s;&s;es</HI> or in <HI>Se&s;tertii.</HI> The <HI>As</HI> was always the denomination of a copper coin. The word <HI>Se&s;|tertius</HI> &s;ignifies two <HI>A&s;&s;es</HI> and a half. Though the <HI>Se&s;tertius,</HI> therefore, was always a &s;ilver coin, its value was e&s;timated in copper. At Rome, one who owed a great deal of money, was &s;aid to have a great deal of other people's copper.</P>
<P>THE northern nations who e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves upon the ruins of the Roman empire, &s;eem to have had &s;ilver money from the fir&s;t beginning of their &s;ettlements, and not to have known either gold or copper coins for &s;everal ages thereafter. There were &s;ilver coins in England in the time of the Saxons; but there was little gold coined till the time of Edward III. nor any copper till that of James I. of Great Britain. In England, therefore, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, I believe, in all other modern nations of Europe, all accounts are kept and the value of all goods and of all e&s;tates is generally computed in &s;ilver: and when we mean to expre&s;s the amount of a per&s;on's fortune, we &s;eldom mention the number
<PB N="47" REF="58">
of guineas, but the number of pounds which we &s;uppo&s;e would be given for it.</P>
<P>IN all countries, I believe, a legal tender of payment could originally be made in the coin of that metal only which was pecu|liarly con&s;idered as the &s;tandard or mea&s;ure of value. In England gold was not con&s;idered as a legal tender for a long time after it was coined into money. The proportion between the values of gold and &s;ilver money was not fixed by any publick law or pro|clamation; but was left to be &s;ettled by the market. If a debtor offered payment in gold, the creditor might either reject &s;uch pay|ment altogether, or accept of it at &s;uch a valuation of the gold as he and his debtor could agree upon. Copper is not at pre&s;ent a legal tender, except in the change of the &s;maller &s;ilver coins. In this &s;tate of things the di&s;tinction between the metal which was the &s;tandard, and that which was not the &s;tandard, was &s;omething more than a nominal di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>IN proce&s;s of time, and as people became gradually more familiar with the u&s;e of the different metals in coin, and con&s;equently better acquainted with the proportion between their re&s;pective values, it has, in mo&s;t countries I believe, been found convenient to a&s;cer|tain this proportion, and to declare by a publick law that a guinea, for example, of &s;uch a weight and finene&s;s, &s;hould exchange for one and twenty &s;hillings, or be a legal tender for a debt of that &s;um. In this &s;tate of things, and during the continuance of any one regulated proportion of this kind, the di&s;tinction between the metal which is the &s;tandard and that which is not the &s;tandard, becomes little more than a nominal di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of any change, however, in this regulated propor|tion, this di&s;tinction becomes, or at lea&s;t &s;eems to become, &s;omething
<PB N="48" REF="59">
more than nominal again. If the regulated value of a guinea, for example, was either reduced to twenty, or rai&s;ed to two and twenty &s;hillings, all accounts being kept and almo&s;t all obli|gations for debt being expre&s;&s;ed in &s;ilver money, the greater part of payments could in either ca&s;e be made with the &s;ame quantity of &s;ilver money as before; but would require very different quan|tities of gold money; a greater in the one ca&s;e, and a &s;maller in the other. Silver would appear to be more invariable in its value than gold. Silver would appear to mea&s;ure the value of gold, and gold would not appear to mea&s;ure the value of &s;ilver. The value of gold would &s;eem to depend upon the quantity of &s;ilver which it would exchange for; and the value of &s;ilver would not &s;eem to depend upon the quantity of gold which it would exchange for. This difference however would be altogether owing to the cu&s;tom of keeping accounts and of expre&s;&s;ing the amount of all great and &s;mall &s;ums rather in &s;ilver than in gold money. One of Mr. Drummond's notes for five and twenty or fifty guineas would, after an alteration of this kind, be &s;till payable with five and twenty or fifty guineas in the &s;ame manner as before. It would, after &s;uch an alteration, be payable with the &s;ame quan|tity of gold as before, but with very different quantities of &s;ilver. In the payment of &s;uch a note, gold would appear to be more invariable in its value than &s;ilver. Gold would appear to mea|&s;ure the value of &s;ilver, and &s;ilver would not appear to mea&s;ure the value of gold. If the cu&s;tom of keeping accounts, and of expre&s;&s;ing promi&s;&s;ory notes and other obligations for money in this manner, &s;hould ever become general, gold, and not &s;ilver, would be con&s;idered as the metal which was peculiarly the &s;tandard or mea&s;ure of value.</P>
<P>IN reality, during the continuance of any one regulated pro|portion between the re&s;pective values of the different metals in
<PB N="49" REF="60">
coin, the value of the mo&s;t precious metal regulates the value of the whole coin. Twelve copper pence contain half a pound, avoirdupois, of copper, of not the be&s;t quality, which, before it is coined, is &s;eldom worth &s;evenpence in &s;ilver. But as by the regulation twelve &s;uch pence are ordered to exchange for a &s;hilling, they are in the market con&s;idered as worth a &s;hilling, and a &s;hilling can at any time be had for them. Even before the late reformation of the gold coin of Great Britain, the gold, that part of it at lea&s;t which circulated in London and its neighbour|hood, was in general le&s;s degraded below its &s;tandard weight than the greater part of the &s;ilver. One and twenty worn and defaced &s;hillings, however, were con&s;idered as equivalent to a guinea, which perhaps, indeed, was worn and defaced too, but &s;eldom &s;o much &s;o. The late regulations have brought the gold coin as near perhaps to its &s;tandard weight as it is po&s;&s;ible to bring the current coin of any nation; and the order, to receive no gold at the publick offices but by weight, is likely to pre&s;erve it &s;o as long as that order is enforced. The &s;ilver coin &s;till continues in the &s;ame worn and degraded &s;tate as before the reformation of the gold coin. In the market, however, one and twenty &s;hillings of this degraded &s;ilver coin are &s;till con&s;idered as worth a guinea of this excellent gold coin.</P>
<P>THE reformation of the gold coin has evidently rai&s;ed the value of the &s;ilver coin which can be exchanged for it.</P>
<P>IN the Engli&s;h mint a pound weight of gold is coined into forty|four guineas and a half, which at one and twenty &s;hillings the guinea, is equal to forty-&s;ix pounds fourteen &s;hillings and &s;ixpence. An ounce of &s;uch gold coin, therefore, is worth 3<HI>l.</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> 10<HI>d.</HI> &frac12; in &s;ilver. In England no duty or &s;eignorage is paid upon the coinage, and he who carries a pound weight or an ounce weight of
<PB N="50" REF="61">
&s;tandard gold bullion to the mint, gets back a pound weight, or an ounce weight of gold in coin, without any deduction. Three pounds &s;eventeen &s;hillings and ten-pence halfpenny an ounce, therefore, is &s;aid to be the mint price of gold in England, or the quantity of gold coin which the mint gives in return for &s;tandard gold bullion.</P>
<P>BEFORE the reformation of the gold coin, the price of &s;tandard gold bullion in the market had for many years been upwards of 3<HI>l.</HI> 18<HI>s.</HI> &s;ometimes 3<HI>l.</HI> 19<HI>s.</HI> and very frequently 4<HI>l.</HI> an ounce; that &s;um it is probable, in the worn and degraded gold coin, &s;eldom containing more than an ounce of &s;tandard gold. Since the reform|ation of the gold coin, the market price of &s;tandard gold bullion &s;eldom exceeds 3<HI>l.</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> 7<HI>d.</HI> an ounce. Before the reformation of the gold coin the market price was always more or le&s;s above the mint price. Since that reformation the market price has been con&s;tantly below the mint price. But that market price is the &s;ame whether it is paid in gold or in &s;ilver coin. The late reformation of the gold coin, therefore, has rai&s;ed not only the value of the gold coin, but likewi&s;e that of the &s;ilver coin in pro|portion to gold bullion, and probably too in proportion to all other commodities; though the price of the greater part of other com|modities being influenced by &s;o many other cau&s;es, the ri&s;e in the value either of gold or &s;ilver coin in proportion to them, may not be &s;o di&s;tinct and &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>IN the Engli&s;h mint a pound weight of &s;tandard &s;ilver bullion is coined into &s;ixty-two &s;hillings, containing, in the &s;ame manner, a pound weight of &s;tandard &s;ilver. Five &s;hillings and two-pence an ounce, therefore, is &s;aid to be the mint price of &s;ilver in England, or the quantity of &s;ilver coin which the mint gives in return for &s;tandard &s;ilver bullion. Before the reformation of the gold coin, the market price of &s;tandard &s;ilver bullion was, upon
<PB N="51" REF="62">
different occa&s;ions, five &s;hillings and four-pence, five &s;hillings and five-pence, five &s;hillings and &s;ixpence, five &s;hillings and &s;even-pence, and very often five &s;hillings and eight-pence an ounce. Five &s;hillings and &s;even-pence, however, &s;eems to have been the mo&s;t common price. Since the reformation of the gold coin, the market price of &s;tandard &s;ilver bullion has fallen occa&s;ionally to five &s;hillings and three-pence, five &s;hillings and four-pence, and five &s;hillings and five-pence an ounce, which la&s;t price it has &s;carce ever exceeded. Though the market price of &s;ilver bullion has fallen con&s;iderably &s;ince the reformation of the gold coin, it has not fallen &s;o low as the mint price.</P>
<P>IN the proportion between the different metals in the Engli&s;h coin, as copper is rated very much above its real value, &s;o &s;ilver is rated &s;omewhat below it. In the market of Europe, in the French coin and in the Dutch coin, an ounce of fine gold ex|changes for about fourteen ounces of fine &s;ilver. In the Engli&s;h coin, it exchanges for about fifteen ounces, that is, for more &s;ilver than it is worth according to the common e&s;timation of Europe. But as the price of copper in bars is not, even in England, rai&s;ed by the high price of copper in Engli&s;h coin, &s;o the price of &s;ilver in bullion is not &s;unk by the low rate of &s;ilver in Engli&s;h coin. Silver in bullion &s;till pre&s;erves its proper proportion to gold; for the &s;ame rea&s;on that copper in bars pre&s;erves its proper proportion to &s;ilver.</P>
<P>UPON the reformation of the &s;ilver coin in the reign of William III. the price of &s;ilver bullion &s;till continued to be &s;omewhat above the mint price. Mr. Locke imputed this high price to the per|mi&s;&s;ion of exporting &s;ilver bullion, and to the prohibition of ex|porting &s;ilver coin. This permi&s;&s;ion of exporting, he &s;aid, rendered the demand for &s;ilver bullion greater than the demand
<PB N="52" REF="63">
for &s;ilver coin. But the number of people who want &s;ilver coin for the common u&s;es of buying and &s;elling at home, is &s;urely much greater than that of tho&s;e who want &s;ilver bullion either for the u&s;e of exportation or for any other u&s;e. There &s;ub&s;i&s;ts at pre|&s;ent a like permi&s;&s;ion of exporting gold bullion and a like prohibi|tion of exporting gold coin; and yet the price of gold bullion has fallen below the mint price. But in the Engli&s;h coin &s;ilver was then, in the &s;ame manner as now, under-rated in proportion to gold; and the gold coin (which at that time too was not &s;up|po&s;ed to require any reformation) regulated then, as well as now, the real value of the whole coin. As the reformation of the &s;ilver coin did not then reduce the price of &s;ilver bullion to the mint price, it is not very probable that a like reformation will do &s;o now.</P>
<P>WERE the &s;ilver coin brought back as near to its &s;tandard weight as the gold, a guinea, it is probable, would, according to the pre&s;ent proportion, exchange for more &s;ilver in coin than it would purcha&s;e in bullion. The &s;ilver coin containing its full &s;tandard weight, there would in this ca&s;e be a profit in melting it down, in order, fir&s;t, to &s;ell the bullion for gold coin, and afterwards to exchange this gold coin for &s;ilver coin to be melted down in the &s;ame manner. Some alteration in the pre&s;ent proportion &s;eems to be the only method of preventing this incon|veniency.</P>
<P>THE inconveniency perhaps would be le&s;s if &s;ilver was rated in the coin as much above its proper proportion to gold as it is at pre&s;ent rated below it; provided it was at the &s;ame time enacted that &s;ilver &s;hould not be a legal tender for more than the change of a guinea; in the &s;ame manner as copper is not a legal tender for more than the change of a &s;hilling. No creditor could in
<PB N="53" REF="64">
this ca&s;e be cheated in con&s;equence of the high valuation of &s;ilver in coin; as no creditor can at pre&s;ent be cheated in con&s;equence of the high valuation of copper. The bankers only would &s;uffer by this regulation. When a run comes upon them they &s;ometimes endeavour to gain time by paying in &s;ixpences, and they would be precluded by this regulation from this di&s;creditable method of evad|ing immediate payment. They would be obliged in con&s;equence to keep at all times in their coffers a greater quantity of ca&s;h than at pre&s;ent; and though this might no doubt be a con&s;iderable in|conveniency to them, it would at the &s;ame time be a con&s;iderable &s;ecurity to their creditors.</P>
<P>THREE pounds &s;eventeen &s;hillings and ten-pence halfpenny (the mint price of gold) certainly does not contain, even in our pre&s;ent excellent gold coin, more than an ounce of &s;tandard gold, and it may be thought, therefore, &s;hould not purcha&s;e more &s;tan|dard bullion. But gold in coin is more convenient than gold in bullion, and though, in England, the coinage is free, yet the gold which is carried in bullion to the mint, can &s;eldom be returned in coin to the owner till after a delay of &s;everal weeks. In the pre&s;ent hurry of the mint, it could not be returned till after a delay of &s;everal months. This delay is equivalent to a &s;mall duty, and renders gold in coin &s;omewhat more valuable than an equal quantity of gold in bullion. If in the Engli&s;h coin &s;ilver was rated according to its proper proportion to gold, the price of &s;ilver bullion would probably fall below the mint price even without any reformation of the &s;ilver coin; the value even of the pre&s;ent worn and defaced &s;ilver coin being regulated by the value of the excellent gold coin for which it can be changed.</P>
<P>A SMALL &s;eignorage or duty upon the coinage of both gold and &s;ilver would probably increa&s;e &s;till more the &s;uperiority of tho&s;e
<PB N="54" REF="65">
metals in coin above an equal quantity of either of them in bul|lion. The coinage would in this ca&s;e increa&s;e the value of the metal coined in proportion to the extent of this &s;mall duty; for the &s;ame rea&s;on that the fa&s;hion increa&s;es the value of plate in propor|tion to the price of that fa&s;hion. The &s;uperiority of coin above bullion would prevent the melting down of the coin, and would di&s;courage its exportation. If upon any publick exigency it &s;hould become nece&s;&s;ary to export the coin, the greater part of it would &s;oon return again of its own accord. Abroad it could &s;ell only for its weight in bullion. At home it would buy more than that weight. There would be a profit, therefore, in bringing it home again. In France a &s;eignorage of about eight per cent. is im|po&s;ed upon the coinage, and the French coin, when exported, is &s;aid to return home again of its own accord.</P>
<P>THE occa&s;ional fluctuations in the market price of gold and &s;ilver bullion ari&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;es as the like fluctuations in that of all other commodities. The frequent lo&s;s of tho&s;e metals from various accidents by &s;ea and by land, the continual wa&s;te of them in gilding and plating, in lace and embroidery, in the tear and wear of coin, and in the tear and wear of plate; require, in all countries which po&s;&s;e&s;s no mines of their own, a continual importation in order to repair this lo&s;s and this wa&s;te. The mer|chant importers, like all other merchants, we may believe, endea|vour, as well as they can, to &s;uit their occa&s;ional importations to what, they judge, is likely to be the immediate demand. With all their attention, however, they &s;ometimes over-do the bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ometimes under-do it. When they import more bullion than is wanted, rather than incur the ri&s;k and trouble of exporting it again, they are &s;ometimes willing to &s;ell a part of it for &s;omething le&s;s than the ordinary or average price. When, on the other hand, they import le&s;s than is wanted, they get &s;omething more than this
<PB N="55" REF="66">
price. But when, under all tho&s;e occa&s;ional fluctuations, the mar|ket price either of gold or &s;ilver bullion continues for &s;everal years together &s;teadily and con&s;tantly, either more or le&s;s above, or more or le&s;s below the mint price; we may be a&s;&s;ured that this &s;teady and con&s;tant, either &s;uperiority or inferiority of price, is the effect of &s;omething in the &s;tate of the coin, which, at that time, renders a certain quantity of coin either of more value or of le&s;s value than the preci&s;e quantity of bullion which it ought to contain. The con&s;tancy and &s;teadine&s;s of the effect, &s;uppo&s;es a propor|tionable con&s;tancy and &s;teadine&s;s in the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THE money of any particular country is, at any particular time and place, more or le&s;s an accurate mea&s;ure of value according as the current coin is more or le&s;s exactly agreeable to its &s;tandard, or contains more or le&s;s exactly the preci&s;e quantity of pure gold or pure &s;ilver which it ought to contain. If in England, for example, forty-four guineas and a half contained exactly a pound weight of &s;tandard gold, or eleven ounces of fine gold and one ounce of alloy, the gold coin of England would be as accurate a mea&s;ure of the actual value of goods at any particular time and place as the nature of the thing would admit. But if, by rubbing and wearing, forty-four guineas and a half generally contain le&s;s than a pound weight of &s;tandard gold; the diminution, however, being greater in &s;ome pieces than in others; the mea&s;ure of value comes to be liable to the &s;ame &s;ort of uncertainly to which all other weights and mea&s;ures are commonly expo&s;ed. As it rarely happens that the&s;e are exactly agreeable to their &s;tandard, the merchant adju&s;ts the price of his goods, as well as he can, not to what tho&s;e weights and mea&s;ures ought to be, but to what, upon an average, he finds by experience, they actually are. In con&s;equence of a like di&s;order in the coin, the price of goods comes, in the &s;ame manner, to be adju&s;ted, not to the quantity of pure gold or &s;ilver which the
<PB N="56" REF="67">
coin ought to contain, but to that which, upon an average, it is found by experience, it actually does contain.</P>
<P>BY the money price of goods, it is to be ob&s;erved, I under&s;tand always the quantity of pure gold or &s;ilver for which they are &s;old, without any regard to the denomination of the coin. Six &s;hillings and eight-pence, for example, in the time of Edward I. I con&s;ider as the &s;ame money price with a pound &s;terling in the pre&s;ent times; becau&s;e it contained as nearly as we can judge the &s;ame quantity of pure &s;ilver.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Of the component Parts of the Price of Commodities.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN that early and rude &s;tate of &s;ociety which preceeds both the accumulation of &s;tock and the appropriation of land, the pro|portion between the quantities of labour nece&s;&s;ary for acquiring different objects &s;eems to be the only circum&s;tance which can afford any rule for exchanging them for one another. If among a nation of hunters, for example, it u&s;ually co&s;ts twice the labour to kill a beaver which it does to kill a deer, one beaver &s;hould naturally exchange for or be worth two deer. It is natural that what is u&s;ually the produce of two days or two hours labour &s;hould be worth double of what is u&s;ually the produce of one day's or one hour's labour.</P>
<P>IF the one &s;pecies of labour &s;hould be more &s;evere than the other, &s;ome allowance will naturally be made for this &s;uperior hard&s;hip;
<PB N="57" REF="68">
and the produce of one hour's labour in the one way may frequently exchange for that of two hours labour in the other.</P>
<P>OR if the one &s;pecies of labour requires an uncommon degree of dexterity and ingenuity, the e&s;teem which men have for &s;uch talents, will naturally give a value to their produce, &s;uperior to what would be due to the time employed about it. Such talents can &s;eldom be acquired but in con&s;equence of long application, and the &s;uperior value of their produce may frequently be no more than a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation for the time and labour which mu&s;t be &s;pent in acquiring them. In the advanced &s;tate of &s;ociety, allowances of this kind, for &s;uperior hard&s;hip and &s;uperior &s;kill, are commonly made in the wages of labour; and &s;omething of the &s;ame kind mu&s;t probably have taken place in its earlie&s;t and rude&s;t period.</P>
<P>IN this &s;tate of things the quantity of labour commonly employed in acquiring or producing any commodity, is the only circum|&s;tance which can regulate the quantity of labour which it ought commonly to purcha&s;e, command, or exchange for.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as &s;tock has accumulated in the hands of particular per&s;ons, &s;ome of them will naturally employ it in &s;etting to work indu&s;trious people, whom they will &s;upply with materials and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, in order to make a profit by the &s;ale of their work, or by what their labour adds to the value of the materials. In ex|changing the complete manufacture either for money, for labour, or for other goods, over and above what may be &s;ufficient to pay the price of the materials, and the wages of the workmen, &s;ome|thing mu&s;t be given for the profits of the undertaker of the work who hazards his &s;tock in this adventure. The value which the workmen add to the materials, therefore, re&s;olves it&s;elf in this
<PB N="58" REF="69">
ca&s;e into two parts, of which the one pays their wages, the other the profits of their employer upon the whole &s;tock of materials and wages which he advanced. He could have no intere&s;t to employ them, unle&s;s he expected from the &s;ale of their work &s;omething more than what was &s;ufficient to replace his &s;tock to him; and he could have no intere&s;t to employ a great &s;tock rather than a &s;mall one, unle&s;s his profits were to bear &s;ome proportion to the extent of his &s;tock.</P>
<P>THE profits of &s;tock, it may perhaps be thought, are only a different name for the wages of a particular &s;ort of labour, the labour of in&s;pection and direction. They are, however, altogether different, are regulated by quite different principles, and bear no proportion to the quantity, the hard&s;hip, or the ingenuity of this &s;uppo&s;ed labour of in&s;pection and direction. They are regulated altogether by the value of the &s;tock employed, and are greater or &s;maller in proportion to the extent of this &s;tock. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for example, that in &s;ome particular place, where the common annual profits of manufacturing &s;tock are ten per cent. there are two different manufactures, in each of which twenty workmen are employed at the rate of fifteen pounds a year each, or at the ex|pence of three hundred a year in each manufactory. Let us &s;up|po&s;e too, that the coar&s;e materials annually wrought up in the one co&s;t only &s;even hundred pounds, while the finer materials in the other co&s;t &s;even thou&s;and. The capital annually employed in the one will in this ca&s;e amount only to one thou&s;and pounds; whereas that employed in the other will amount to &s;even thou&s;and three hundred pounds. At the rate of ten per cent. therefore, the un|dertaker of the one will expect an yearly profit of about one hundred pounds only; while that of the other will expect about &s;even hundred and thirty pounds. But though their profits are &s;o very different, their labour of in&s;pection and direction may be
<PB N="59" REF="70">
either altogether or very nearly the &s;ame. In many great works, almo&s;t the whole labour of this kind is frequently committed to &s;ome principal clerk. His wages properly expre&s;s the value of this labour of in&s;pection and direction. Though in &s;ettling them &s;ome regard is had commonly, not only to his labour and &s;kill, but to the tru&s;t which is repo&s;ed in him, yet they never bear any regular proportion to the capital of which he over&s;ees the manage|ment; and the owner of this capital, though he is thus di&s;charged of almo&s;t all labour, &s;till expects that his profits &s;hould bear a regular proportion to it. In the price of commodities, there|fore, the profits of &s;tock are a &s;ource of value altogether different from the wages of labour, and regulated by quite different prin|ciples.</P>
<P>IN this &s;tate of things, therefore, the quantity of labour com|monly employed in acquiring or producing any commodity, is by no means the only circum&s;tance which can regulate the quantity which it ought commonly to purcha&s;e, command, or exchange for. An additional quantity, it is evident, mu&s;t be due, for the profits of the &s;tock which advanced the wages and furni&s;hed the materials of that labour.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the land of any country has all become private pro|perty, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never &s;owed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the fore&s;t, the gra&s;s of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which, when land was in common, co&s;t only the trouble of gathering them, come to have an additional price fixed upon them. Men mu&s;t then pay for the licence to gather them; and in exchanging them either for money, for labour, or for other goods, over and above what is due, both for the labour of ga|thering them, and for the profits of the &s;tock which employs that
<PB N="60" REF="71">
labour, &s;ome allowance mu&s;t be made for the price of the licence, which con&s;titutes the fir&s;t rent of land. In the price, therefore, of the greater part of commodities the rent of land comes in this manner to con&s;titute a third &s;ource of value.</P>
<P>IN this &s;tate of things, neither the quantity of labour commonly employed in acquiring or producing any commodity, nor the pro|fits of the &s;tock which advanced the wages and furni&s;hed the ma|terials of that labour, are the only circum&s;tances which can regulate the quantity of labour which it ought commonly to purcha&s;e, command, or exchange for. A third circum&s;tance mu&s;t likewi&s;e be taken into con&s;ideration; the rent of the land; and the commo|dity mu&s;t commonly purcha&s;e, command, or exchange for, an additional quantity of labour, in order to enable the per&s;on who brings it to market to pay this rent.</P>
<P>THE real value of all the different component parts of price is in this manner mea&s;ured by the quantity of labour which they can, each of them, purcha&s;e or command. Labour mea&s;ures the value not only of that part of price which re&s;olves it&s;elf into labour, but of that which re&s;olves it&s;elf into rent, and of that which re&s;olves it&s;elf into profit.</P>
<P>IN every &s;ociety the price of every commodity finally re&s;olves it&s;elf into &s;ome one or other, or all of tho&s;e three parts; and in every improved &s;ociety, all the three enter more or le&s;s, as compo|nent parts, into the price of the far greater part of commodities.</P>
<P>IN the price of corn, for example, one part pays the rent of the landlord, another pays the wages or maintenance of the labourers and labouring cattle employed in producing it, and the third pays the profit of the farmer. The&s;e three parts &s;eem either imme|diately
<PB N="61" REF="72">
or ultimately to make up the whole price of corn. A fourth part it may perhaps be thought, is nece&s;&s;ary for replacing the &s;tock of the farmer, or for compen&s;ating the tear and wear of his la|bouring cattle, and other in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry. But it mu&s;t be con&s;idered that the price of any in&s;trument of hu&s;bandry, &s;uch as a labouring hor&s;e, is it&s;elf made up of the &s;ame three parts; the rent of the land upon which he is reared, the labour of tending and rearing him, and the profits of the farmer who advances both the rent of this land, and the wages of this labour. Though the price of the corn, therefore, may pay the price as well as the mainte|nance of the hor&s;e, the whole price &s;till re&s;olves it&s;elf either im|mediately or ultimately into the &s;ame three parts of rent, labour, and profit.</P>
<P>IN the price of flour or meal, we mu&s;t add to the price of the corn, the profits of the miller, and the wages of his &s;er|vants; in the price of bread, the profits of the baker, and the wages of his &s;ervants; and in the price of both, the labour of tran&s;porting the corn from the hou&s;e of the farmer to that of the miller, and from that of the miller to that of the baker, to|gether with the profits of tho&s;e who advance the wages of that labour.</P>
<P>THE price of flax re&s;olves it&s;elf into the &s;ame three parts as that of corn. In the price of linen we mu&s;t add to this price the wages of the flax-dre&s;&s;er, of the &s;pinner, of the weaver, of the bleacher, &amp;c. together with the profits of their re&s;pective em|ployers.</P>
<P>AS any particular commodity comes to be more manufactured, that part of the price which re&s;olves it&s;elf into wages and profit, comes to be greater in proportion to that which re&s;olves it&s;elf into
<PB N="62" REF="73">
rent. In the progre&s;s of the manufacture, not only the number of profits increa&s;e, but every &s;ub&s;equent profit is greater than the foregoing; becau&s;e the capital from which it is derived mu&s;t al|ways be greater. The capital which employs the weavers, for example, mu&s;t be greater than that which employs the &s;pinngers; becau&s;e it not only replaces that capital with its profits, but pays, be&s;ides, the wages of the weavers; and the profits mu&s;t always bear &s;ome proportion to the capital.</P>
<P>IN the mo&s;t improved &s;ocieties, however, there are always a few commodities of which the price re&s;olves it&s;elf into two parts only, the wages of labour, and the profits of &s;tock; and a &s;till &s;maller number in which it con&s;i&s;ts altogether in the wages of labour. In the price of &s;ea-fi&s;h, for example, one part pays the labour of the fi&s;hermen, and the other the profits of the capital employed in the fi&s;hery. Rent very &s;eldom makes any part of it, though it does &s;ometimes, as I &s;hall &s;hew hereafter. It is other|wi&s;e, at lea&s;t through the greater part of Europe, in river fi&s;heries. A &s;almon fi&s;hery pays a rent, and rent, though it cannot well be called the rent of land, makes a part of the price of a &s;almon as well as wages and profit. In &s;ome parts of Scotland a few poor people make a trade of gathering, along the &s;ea &s;hore, tho&s;e little variegated &s;tones commonly known by the name of Scotch Pebbles. The price which is paid to them by the &s;tone-cutter is altogether the wages of their labour; neither rent nor profit make any part of it.</P>
<P>BUT the whole price of every commodity mu&s;t &s;till finally re|&s;olve it&s;elf into &s;ome one or other or all of tho&s;e three parts; as whatever part of it remains after paying the rent of the land, and the price of the whole labour employed in rai&s;ing, manufacturing, and bringing it to market, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be profit to &s;omebody.</P>

As the price or exchangeable value of every particular commo|dity, taken &s;eparately, re&s;olves it&s;elf into &s;ome one or other or all of tho&s;e three parts; &s;o that of all the commodities which compo&s;e the whole annual produce of the labour of every country, taken complexly, mu&s;t re&s;olve it&s;elf into the &s;ame three parts, and be parcelled out among different inhabitants of the country, either as the wages of their labour, the profits of their &s;tock, or the rent of their land. The whole of what is annually either collected or produced by the labour of every &s;ociety, or what comes to the &s;ame thing, the whole price of it, is in this manner originally di&s;tributed among &s;ome of its different members. Wages, profit, and rent, are the three original &s;ources of all revenue as well as of all ex|changeable value. All other revenue is ultimately derived from &s;ome one or other of the&s;e.</P>
<P>WHOEVER derives his revenue from a fund which is his own, mu&s;t draw it either from his labour, from his &s;tock, or from his land. The revenue derived from labour is called wages. That de|rived from &s;tock, by the per&s;on who manages or employs it, is called profit. That derived from it by the per&s;on who does not employ it him&s;elf, but lends it to another, is called the intere&s;t or the u&s;e of money. It is the compen&s;ation which the borrower pays to the lender, for the profit which he has an opportunity of making by the u&s;e of the money. Part of that profit naturally belongs to the borrower, who runs the ri&s;k and takes the trouble of employing it; and part to the lender, who affords him the opportunity of making this profit. The intere&s;t of money is always a derivative revenue, which, if it is not paid from the profit which is made by the u&s;e of the money, mu&s;t be paid from &s;ome other &s;ource of revenue, unle&s;s perhaps the borrower is a &s;pendthrift, who con|tracts a &s;econd debt in order to pay the intere&s;t of the fir&s;t. The revenue which proceeds altogether from land, is called rent, and
<PB N="64" REF="75">
belongs to the landlord. The revenue of the farmer is derived partly from his labour, and partly from his &s;tock. To him, land is only the in&s;trument which enables him to earn the wages of this labour, and to make the profits of this &s;tock. All taxes, and all the revenue which is founded upon them, all &s;alaries, pen&s;ions, and annuities of every kind, are ultimately derived from &s;ome one or other of tho&s;e three original &s;ources of revenue, and are paid either immediately or mediately from the wages of labour, the profits of &s;tock, or the rent of land.</P>
<P>WHEN tho&s;e three different &s;orts of revenue belong to different per&s;ons, they are readily di&s;tingui&s;hed; but when they belong to the &s;ame they are &s;ometimes confounded with one another, at lea&s;t in common language.</P>
<P>A GENTLEMAN who farms a part of his own e&s;tate, after paying the expence of cultivation, &s;hould gain both the rent of the land|lord and the profit of the farmer. He is apt to denominate, how|ever, his whole gain, profit, and thus confounds rent with profit, at lea&s;t in common language. The greater part of our North American and We&s;t Indian planters are in this &s;ituation. They farm, the greater part of them, their own e&s;tates, and accordingly we &s;eldom hear of the rent of a plantation, but frequently of its profit.</P>
<P>COMMON farmers &s;eldom employ any over&s;eer to direct the general operations of the farm. They generally too work a good deal with their own hands, as ploughmen, harrowers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> What remains of the crop after paying the rent, therefore, &s;hould not only replace to them their &s;tock employed in cultivation, together with its ordinary profits, but pay them the wages which are due to them, both as labourers and over&s;eers. Whatever remains,
<PB N="65" REF="76">
however, after paying the rent and keeping up the &s;tock, is called profit. But wages evidently make a part of it. The farmer, by &s;aving the&s;e wages, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily gain them. Wages, therefore, are in this ca&s;e confounded with profit.</P>
<P>AN independent manufacturer, who has &s;tock enough both to purcha&s;e materials and to maintain him&s;elf till he can carry his work to market, &s;hould gain both the wages of a journeyman, who works under a ma&s;ter, and the profit which that ma&s;ter makes by the &s;ale of his work. His whole gains, however, are commonly called profit, and wages are, in this ca&s;e too, confounded with profit.</P>
<P>A GARDENER who cultivates his own garden with his own hands, unites in his own per&s;on the three different characters, of landlord, farmer, and labourer. His produce, therefore, &s;hould pay him the rent of the fir&s;t, the profit of the &s;econd, and the wages of the third. The whole, however, is commonly con&s;idered as the earnings of his labour. Both rent and profit are, in this ca&s;e, confounded with wages.</P>
<P>As in a civilized country there are but few commodities of which the exchangeable value ari&s;es from labour only, rent and profit contributing largely to that of the far greater part of them, &s;o the annual produce of its labour will always be &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e or command a much greater quantity of labour than what was em|ployed in rai&s;ing, preparing, and bringing that produce to market. If the &s;ociety was annually to employ all the labour which it can annually purcha&s;e, as the quantity of labour would increa&s;e greatly every year, &s;o the produce of every &s;ucceeding year would be of va&s;tly greater value than that of the foregoing. But there is no country in which the whole annual produce is employed in maintaining the

indu&s;trious. The idle every where con&s;ume a great part of it; and according to the different proportions in which it is annually divided between tho&s;e two different orders of people, its ordinary or average value mu&s;t either annually increa&s;e, or dimini&s;h, or continue the &s;ame from one year to another.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Of the natural and market Price of Commodities.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE is in every &s;ociety or neighbourhood an ordinary or average rate both of wages and profit in every different em|ployment of labour and &s;tock. This rate is naturally regulated, as I &s;hall &s;how hereafter, partly by the general circum&s;tances of the &s;ociety, their riches or poverty, their advancing, &s;tationary, or declining condition; and partly by the particular nature of each employment.</P>
<P>THERE is likewi&s;e in every &s;ociety or neighbourhood an ordinary or average rate of rent, which is regulated too, as I &s;hall &s;how hereafter, partly by the general circum&s;tances of the &s;ociety or neighbourhood in which the land is &s;ituated, and partly by the natural or improved fertility of the land.</P>
<P>THESE ordinary or average rates may be called the natural rates of wages, profit, and rent, at the time and place in which they commonly prevail.</P>
<P>WHEN the price of any commodity is neither more nor le&s;s than what is &s;ufficient to pay the rent of the land, the wages of the
<PB N="67" REF="78">
labour, and the profits of the &s;tock employed in rai&s;ing, preparing, and bringing it to market, according to their natural rates, the commodity is then &s;old for what may be called its natural price.</P>
<P>THE commodity is then &s;old preci&s;ely for what it is worth, or for what it really co&s;ts the per&s;on who brings it to market; for though in common language what is called the prime co&s;t of any commodity does not comprehend the profit of the per&s;on who is to &s;ell it again, yet if he &s;ells it at a price which does not allow him the ordinary rate of profit in his neighbourhood, he is evidently a lo&s;er by the trade; &s;ince by employing his &s;tock in &s;ome other way he might have made that profit. His profit, be&s;ides, is his revenue, the proper fund of his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. As, while he is preparing and bringing the goods to market, he advances to his workmen their wages, or their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;o he advances to him&s;elf, in the &s;ame manner, his own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, which is generally &s;uitable to the profit which he may rea&s;onably expect from the &s;ale of his goods. Unle&s;s they yield him this profit, therefore, they do not repay him what they may very properly be &s;aid to have really co&s;t him.</P>
<P>THOUGH the price, therefore, which leaves him this profit, is not always the lowe&s;t at which a dealer may &s;ometimes &s;ell his goods, it is the lowe&s;t at which he is likely to &s;ell them for any con&s;iderable time; at lea&s;t where there is perfect liberty, or where he may change his trade as often as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>THE actual price at which any commodity is commonly &s;old is called its market price. It may either be above, or below, or exactly the &s;ame with its natural price.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="79">
THE market price of every particular commodity is regulated by the proportion between the quantity which is actually brought to market, and the demand of tho&s;e who are willing to pay the natural price of the commodity, or the whole value of the rent, labour, and profit, which mu&s;t be paid in order to bring it thither. Such people may be called the effectual demanders, and their de|mand the effectual demand; &s;ince it may be &s;ufficient to effectuate the bringing of the commodity to market. It is different from the ab&s;olute demand. A very poor man may be &s;aid, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, to have a demand for a coach and &s;ix; he might like to have it; but his demand is not an effectual demand, as the commodity can never be brought to market in order to &s;atisfy it.</P>
<P>WHEN the quantity of any commodity which is brought to market falls &s;hort of the effectual demand, all tho&s;e who are wil|ling to pay the whole value of the rent, wages, and profit, which mu&s;t be paid in order to bring it thither, cannot be &s;upplied with the quantity which they want. Rather than want it altogether, &s;ome of them will be willing to give more. A competition will immediately begin among them, and the market price will ri&s;e more or le&s;s above the natural price, according as the greatne&s;s of the deficiency increa&s;es more or le&s;s the eagerne&s;s of this competition. The &s;ame deficiency will generally occa&s;ion a more or le&s;s eager com|petition, according as the acqui&s;ition of the commodity happens to be of more or le&s;s importance to the competitors. Hence the ex|orbitant price of the nece&s;&s;aries of life during the blockade of a town or in a famine.</P>
<P>WHEN the quantity brought to market exceeds the effectual demand, it cannot be all &s;old to tho&s;e who are willing to pay the whole value of the rent, wages and profit, which mu&s;t be paid in order to bring it thither. Some part mu&s;t be &s;old to tho&s;e who
<PB N="69" REF="80">
are willing to pay le&s;s, and the low price which they give for it mu&s;t reduce the price of the whole. The market price will &s;ink more or le&s;s below the natural price, according as the greatne&s;s of the exce&s;s increa&s;es more or le&s;s the competition of the &s;ellers, or according as it happens to be more or le&s;s important to them to get immediately rid of the commodity. The &s;ame exce&s;s in the importation of peri&s;hable, will occa&s;ion a much greater com|petition than in that of durable commodities; in the importation of oranges, for example, than in that of old iron.</P>
<P>WHEN the quantity brought to market is ju&s;t &s;ufficient to &s;upply the effectual demand and no more, the market price naturally comes to be either exactly, or as nearly as can be judged of, the &s;ame with the natural price. The whole quantity upon hand can be di&s;po&s;ed of for this price, and cannot be di&s;po&s;ed of for more. The competition of the different dealers obliges them all to accept of this price, but does not oblige them to accept of le&s;s.</P>
<P>THE quantity of every commodity brought to market naturally &s;uits it&s;elf to the effectual demand. It is the intere&s;t of all tho&s;e who employ their land, labour, or &s;tock, in bringing any com|modity to market, that the quantity never &s;hould exceed the effec|tual demand; and it is the intere&s;t of all other people that it never &s;hould fall &s;hort of it.</P>
<P>IF at any time it exceeds the effectual demand, &s;ome of the component parts of its price mu&s;t be paid below their natural rate. If it is rent, the intere&s;t of the landlords will immediately prompt them to withdraw a part of their land; and if it is wages or profit, the intere&s;t of the labourers in the one ca&s;e, and of their employers in the other, will prompt them to withdraw
<PB N="70" REF="81">
a part of their labour or &s;tock from this employment. The quantity brought to market will &s;oon be no more than &s;ufficient to &s;upply the effectual demand. All the different parts of its price will ri&s;e to their natural rate, and the whole price to its natural price.</P>
<P>IF, on the contrary, the quantity brought to market &s;hould at any time fall &s;hort of the effectual demand, &s;ome of the com|ponent parts of its price mu&s;t ri&s;e above their natural rate. If it is rent, the intere&s;t of all other landlords will naturally prompt them to prepare more land for the rai&s;ing of this commodity; if it is wages or profit, the intere&s;t of all other labourers and dealers will &s;oon prompt them to employ more labour and &s;tock in pre|paring and bringing it to market. The quantity brought thither will &s;oon be &s;ufficient to &s;upply the effectual demand. All the different parts of its price will &s;oon &s;ink to their natural rate, and the whole price to its natural price.</P>
<P>THE natural price, therefore, is, as it were, the central price, to which the prices of all commodities are continually gravitating. Different accidents may &s;ometimes keep them &s;u&s;pended a good deal above it, and &s;ometimes force them down even &s;omewhat below it. But whatever may be the ob&s;tacles which hinder them from &s;ettling in this center of repo&s;e and continuance, they are con&s;tantly tending towards it.</P>
<P>THE whole quantity of indu&s;try annually employed in order to bring any commodity to market, naturally &s;uits it&s;elf in this manner to the effectual demand. It naturally aims at bringing always that preci&s;e quantity thither which may be &s;ufficient to &s;upply, and no more than &s;upply, that demand.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="82">
BUT in &s;ome employments the &s;ame quantity of indu&s;try will in different years produce very different quantities of commodities; while in others it will produce always the &s;ame, or very nearly the &s;ame. The &s;ame number of labourers in hu&s;bandry will, in different years, produce very different quantities of corn, wine, oil, hops, &amp;c. But the &s;ame number of &s;pinners and weavers will every year produce the &s;ame or very nearly the &s;ame quantity of linen and woollen cloth. It is only the average produce of the one &s;pecies of indu&s;try which can be &s;uited in any re&s;pect to the effectual demand; and as its actual produce is frequently much greater and frequently much le&s;s than its average produce, the quantity of the commodities brought to market will &s;ometimes exceed a good deal, and &s;ometimes fall &s;hort a good deal of the effectual demand. Even though that demand therefore &s;hould continue always the &s;ame, their market price will be liable to great fluctuations, will &s;ometimes fall a good deal below, and &s;ometimes ri&s;e a good deal above their natural price. In the other &s;pecies of indu&s;try, the produce of equal quantities of labour being always the &s;ame or very nearly the &s;ame, it can be more exactly &s;uited to the effectual demand. While that demand con|tinues the &s;ame, therefore, the market price of the commodities is likely to do &s;o too, and to be either altogether, or as nearly as can be judged of, the &s;ame with the natural price. That the price of linen and woollen cloth is liable neither to &s;uch frequent nor to &s;uch great variations as the price of corn, every man's ex|perience will inform him. The price of the one &s;pecies of com|modities varies only with the variations in the demand: That of the other varies, not only with the variations in the demand, but with the much greater and more frequent variations in the quantity of what is brought to market in order to &s;upply that demand.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="83">
THE occa&s;ional and temporary fluctuations in the market price of any commodity fall chiefly upon tho&s;e parts of its price which re&s;olve them&s;elves into wages and profit. That part which re&s;olves it&s;elf into rent is le&s;s affected by them. A rent certain in money is not in the lea&s;t affected by them either in its rate or in its value. A rent which con&s;i&s;ts either in a certain proportion or in a certain quantity of the rude produce, is no doubt affected in its yearly value by all the occa&s;ional and temporary fluctuations in the market price of that rude produce: but it is &s;eldom affected by them in its yearly rate. In &s;ettling the terms of the lea&s;e, the landlord and farmer endeavour, according to their be&s;t judge|ment, to adju&s;t that rate, not to the temporary and occa&s;ional, but to the average and ordinary price of the produce.</P>
<P>SUCH fluctuations affect both the value and the rate either of wages or of profit, according as the market happens to be either over-&s;tocked or under-&s;tocked with commodities or with labour; with work done, or with work to be done. A publick mourning rai&s;es the price of black cloth (with which the market is almo&s;t always under-&s;tocked upon &s;uch occa&s;ions) and augments the profits of the merchants who po&s;&s;e&s;s any con&s;iderable quantity of it. It has no effect upon the wages of the weavers. The market is under-&s;tocked with commodities, not with labour; with work done, not with work to be done. It rai&s;es the wages of journey|men taylors. The market is here under-&s;tocked with labour. There is an effectual demand for labour, for more work to be done than can be had. It &s;inks the price of coloured &s;ilks and cloths, and thereby reduces the profits of the merchants who have any con&s;iderable quantity of them upon hand. It &s;inks too the wages of the workmen employed in preparing &s;uch commodities, for which all demand is &s;topped for &s;ix months, perhaps for a
<PB N="73" REF="84">
twelvemonth. The market is here over&s;tocked both with commo|dities and with labour.</P>
<P>BUT though the market price of every particular commodity is in this manner continually gravitating, if one may &s;ay &s;o, towards the natural price, yet &s;ometimes particular accidents, &s;ome|times natural cau&s;es, and &s;ometimes particular regulations of police, may, in many commodities, keep up the market price, for a long time together, a good deal above the natural price.</P>
<P>WHEN by an increa&s;e in the effectual demand, the market price of &s;ome particular commodity happens to ri&s;e a good deal above the natural price, tho&s;e who employ their &s;tocks in &s;upplying that market are generally careful to conceal this change. If it was commonly known, their great profit would tempt &s;o many new rivals to employ their &s;tocks in the &s;ame way that, the effectual demand being fully &s;upplied, the market price would &s;oon be re|duced to the natural price, and perhaps for &s;ome time even below it. If the market is at a great di&s;tance from the re&s;idence of tho&s;e who &s;upply it, they may &s;ometimes be able to keep the &s;ecret for &s;everal years together, and may &s;o long enjoy their extra|ordinary profits without any new rivals. Secrets of this kind however, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, can &s;eldom be long kept; and the extraordinary profit can la&s;t very little longer than they are kept.</P>
<P>SECRETS in manufactures are capable of being longer kept than &s;ecrets in trade. A dyer who has found the means of pro|ducing a particular colour with materials which co&s;t only half the price of tho&s;e commonly made u&s;e of, may, with good manage|ment, enjoy the advantage of his di&s;covery as long as he lives, and even leave it as a legacy to his po&s;terity. His extraordinary
<PB N="74" REF="85">
gains ari&s;e from the high price which is paid for his private labour. They properly con&s;i&s;t in the high wages of that labour. But as they are repeated upon every part of his &s;tock, and as their whole amount bears, upon that account, a regular proportion to it, they are commonly con&s;idered as extraordinary profits of &s;tock.</P>
<P>SUCH enhancements of the market price are evidently the effects of particular accidents, of which, however, the operation may &s;ometimes la&s;t for many years together.</P>
<P>SOME natural productions require &s;uch a &s;ingularity of &s;oil and &s;ituation, that all the land in a great country, which is fit for pro|ducing them, may not be &s;ufficient to &s;upply the effectual demand. The whole quantity brought to market, therefore, may be di&s;|po&s;ed of to tho&s;e who are willing to give more than what is &s;ufficient to pay the rent of the land which produced them, together with the wages of the labour, and the profits of the &s;tock which were em|ployed in preparing and bringing them to market, according to their natural rates. Such commodities may continue to be &s;old at this high price for whole centuries together, and that part of it which re&s;olves it&s;elf into the rent of land is in this ca&s;e the part which is generally paid above its natural rate. The rent of the land which affords &s;uch &s;ingular and e&s;teemed productions, like the rent of &s;ome vineyards in France of a peculiarly happy &s;oil and &s;ituation, bears no regular proportion to the rent of other equally fertile and equally well cultivated land in its neighbourhood. The wages of the labour and the profits of the &s;tock employed in bringing &s;uch commodities to market, on the contrary, are &s;eldom out of their natural proportion to tho&s;e of the other employments of labour and &s;tock in their neighbourhood.</P>
<P>SUCH enhancements of the market price are evidently the effect of natural cau&s;es which may hinder the effectual demand
<PB N="75" REF="86">
from ever being fully &s;upplied, and which may continue, therefore, to operate forever.</P>
<P>A MONOPOLY granted either to an individual or to a trading company has the &s;ame effect as a &s;ecret in trade or manufactures. The monopoli&s;ts, by keeping the market con&s;tantly under&s;tocked, by never fully &s;upplying the effectual demand, &s;ell their commo|dities much above the natural price, and rai&s;e their emoluments, whether they con&s;i&s;t in wages or profit, greatly above their natu|ral rate.</P>
<P>THE price of monopoly is upon every occa&s;ion the highe&s;t which can be got. The natural price, or the price of free competition, on the contrary, is the lowe&s;t which can be taken, not upon every occa&s;ion, indeed, but for any con&s;iderable time together. The one is upon every occa&s;ion the highe&s;t which can be &s;queezed out of the buyers, or which, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, they will con&s;ent to give: The other is the lowe&s;t which the &s;ellers can commonly afford to take, and at the &s;ame time continue their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE exclu&s;ive privileges of corporations, &s;tatutes of apprentice|&s;hip, and all tho&s;e laws which re&s;train, in particular employments, the competition to a &s;maller number than might otherwi&s;e go into them, have the &s;ame tendency, though in a le&s;s degree. They are a &s;ort of enlarged monopolies, and may frequently, for ages to|gether and in whole cla&s;&s;es of employments, keep up the market price of particular commodities above the natural price, and main|tain both the wages of the labour and the profits of the &s;tock employed about them &s;omewhat above their natural rate.</P>
<P>SUCH enhancements of the market price may la&s;t as long as the regulations of police which give occa&s;ion to them.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="87">
THE market price of any particular commodity, though it may continue long above, can &s;eldom continue long below its natural price. Whatever part of it was paid below the natural rate, the per&s;ons who&s;e intere&s;t it affected would immediately feel the lo&s;s, and would immediately withdraw either &s;o much land, or &s;o much labour, or &s;o much &s;tock, from being employed about it, that the quantity brought to market would &s;oon be no more than &s;ufficient to &s;upply the effectual demand. Its market price, therefore, would &s;oon ri&s;e to the natural price. This at lea&s;t would be the ca&s;e where there was perfect liberty.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame &s;tatutes of apprentice&s;hip and other corporation laws indeed, which, when a manufacture is in pro&s;perity, enable the workman to rai&s;e his wages a good deal above their natural rate, &s;ometimes oblige him, when it decays, to let them down a good deal below it. As in the one ca&s;e they exclude many people from his employment, &s;o in the other they exclude him from many employments. The effect of &s;uch regulations, however, is not near &s;o durable in &s;inking the workman's wages below, as in rai&s;ing them above their natural rate. Their operation in the one way may endure for many centuries, but in the other it can la&s;t no longer than the lives of &s;ome of the workmen who were bred to the bu&s;ine&s;s in the time of its pro&s;perity. When they are gone, the number of tho&s;e who are afterwards educated to the trade will natu|rally &s;uit it&s;elf to the effectual demand. The police mu&s;t be as violent as that of Indo&s;tan or antient Egypt (where every man was bound by a principle of religion to follow the occupation of his father, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to commit the mo&s;t horrid &s;acrilege if he changed it for another) which can in any particular employment, and for &s;everal generations together, &s;ink either the wages of labour or the profits of &s;tock below their natural rate.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="88">
THIS is all that I think nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved at pre&s;ent con|cerning the deviations, whether occa&s;ional or permanent, of the market price of commodities from the natural price.</P>
<P>THE natural price it&s;elf varies with the natural rate of each of its component parts, of wages, profit, and rent; and in every &s;ociety this rate varies according to their circum&s;tances, accord|ing to their riches or poverty, their advancing, &s;tationary, or de|clining condition. I &s;hall, in the four following chapters, endea|vour to explain, as fully and di&s;tinctly as I can, the cau&s;es of tho&s;e different variations.</P>
<P>FIRST, I &s;hall endeavour to explain what are the circum&s;tances which naturally determine the rate of wages, and in what manner tho&s;e circum&s;tances are affected by the riches or poverty, by the advancing, &s;tationary, or declining &s;tate of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how what are the circum|&s;tances which naturally determine the rate of profit, and in what manner too tho&s;e circum&s;tances are affected by the like variations in the &s;tate of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THOUGH pecuniary wages and profit are very different in the different employments of labour and &s;tock; yet a certain propor|tion &s;eems commonly to take place between both the pecuniary wages in all the different employments of labour, and the pecu|niary profits in all the different employments of &s;tock. This proportion, it will appear hereafter, depends partly upon the nature of the different employments, and partly upon the different laws and policy of the &s;ociety in which they are carried on.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Of the Wages of Labour.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE produce of labour con&s;titutes the natural recompence or wages of labour.</P>
<P>IN that original &s;tate of things, which precedes both the appro|priation of land and the accumulation of &s;tock, the whole pro|duce of labour belongs to the labourer. He has neither landlord nor ma&s;ter to &s;hare with him.</P>
<P>HAD this &s;tate continued, the wages of labour would have aug|mented with all tho&s;e improvements in its productive powers, to which the divi&s;ion of labour gives occa&s;ion. All things would gradually have become cheaper. They would have been produced by a &s;maller quantity of labour; and as the commodities produced by equal quantities of labour would naturally in this &s;tate of
<PB N="79" REF="90">
things be exchanged for one another, they would have been pur|cha&s;ed likewi&s;e with the produce of a &s;maller quantity.</P>
<P>BUT though all things would have become cheaper in reality, in appearance many things might have become dearer than be|fore, or have been exchanged for a greater quantity of other goods. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for example, that in the greater part of employ|ments the productive powers of labour had been improved to ten|fold, or that a day's labour could produce ten times the quantity of work which it had done originally; but that in a particular em|ployment they had been improved only to double, or that a day's labour could produce only twice the quantity of work which it had done before. In exchanging the produce of a day's labour in the greater part of employments, for that of a day's labour in this par|ticular one, ten times the original quantity of work in them would purcha&s;e only twice the original quantity in it. Any particular quantity in it, therefore, a pound weight, for example, would appear to be five times dearer than before. In reality, however, it would be twice as cheap. Though it required five times the quantity of other goods to purcha&s;e it, it would require only half the quantity of labour either to purcha&s;e or to produce it. The acqui&s;ition, therefore, would be twice as ea&s;y as before.</P>
<P>BUT this original &s;tate of things, in which the labourer enjoyed the whole produce of his own labour, could not la&s;t beyond the fir&s;t introduction of the appropriation of land and the accumulation of &s;tock. It was at an end, therefore, long before the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable improvements were made in the productive powers of labour, and it would be to no purpo&s;e to trace further what might have been its effects upon the recompence or wages of labour.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as land becomes private property, the landlord demands a &s;hare of whatever produce te labourer can either rai&s;e or col|lect
<PB N="80" REF="91">
from it. His rent makes the fir&s;t deduction from the produce of the labour which is employed upon land.</P>
<P>IT &s;eldom happens that the per&s;on who tills the ground has wherewithal to maintain him&s;elf till he reaps the harve&s;t. His maintenance is generally advanced to him from the &s;tock of a ma&s;ter, the farmer who employs him, and who would have no intere&s;t to employ him, unle&s;s he was to &s;hare in the produce of his labour, or unle&s;s his &s;tock was to be replaced to him with a profit. This profit makes a &s;econd deduction from the produce of the labour which is employed upon land.</P>
<P>THE produce of almo&s;t all other labour is liable to the like deduction of profit. In all arts and manufactures the greater part of the workmen &s;tand in need of a ma&s;ter to advance them the materials of their work, and their wages and maintenance till it be compleated. He &s;hares in the produce of their labour, or in the value which it adds to the materials upon which it is be&s;towed; and in this &s;hare con&s;i&s;ts his profit.</P>
<P>IT &s;ometimes happens, indeed, that a &s;ingle independant work|man has &s;tock &s;ufficient both to purcha&s;e the materials of his work, and to maintain him&s;elf till it be compleated. He is both ma&s;ter and workman, and enjoys the whole produce of his own labour, or the whole value which it adds to the materials upon which it is be&s;towed. It includes what are u&s;ually two di&s;tinct revenues, belonging to two di&s;tinct per&s;ons, the profits of &s;tock, and the wages of labour.</P>
<P>SUCH ca&s;es, however, are not very frequent, and in every part of Europe, twenty workmen &s;erve under a ma&s;ter for one that is independant; and the wages of labour are every where under&s;tood
<PB N="81" REF="92">
to be, what they u&s;ually are, when the labourer is one per&s;on, and the owner of the &s;tock which employs him another.</P>
<P>WHAT are the common wages of labour depends every where upon the contract u&s;ually made between tho&s;e two parties, who&s;e intere&s;ts are by no means the &s;ame. The workmen de&s;ire to get as much, the ma&s;ters to give as little as po&s;&s;ible. The former are di&s;po&s;ed to combine in order to rai&s;e, the latter in order to lower the wages of labour.</P>
<P>IT is not, however, difficult to fore&s;ee which of the two parties mu&s;t, upon all ordinary occa&s;ions, have the advantage in the di&s;|pute, and force the other into a compliance with their terms. The ma&s;ters, being fewer in number, cannot only combine more ea&s;ily, but the law authori&s;es their combinations, or at lea&s;t does not prohibit them, while it prohibits tho&s;e of the workmen. We have no acts of parliament again&s;t combining to lower the price of work; but many again&s;t combining to rai&s;e it. In all &s;uch di&s;|putes the ma&s;ters can hold out much longer. A landlord, a far|mer, a ma&s;ter manufacturer, or merchant, though they did not employ a &s;ingle workman, could generally live a year or two upon the &s;tocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t a week, few could &s;ub&s;i&s;t a month, and &s;carce any a year without employment. In the long-run the workman may be as nece&s;&s;ary to his ma&s;ter as his ma&s;ter is to him; but the nece&s;&s;ity is not &s;o immediate.</P>
<P>WE rarely hear, it has been &s;aid, of the combinations of ma&s;ters; though frequently of tho&s;e of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that ma&s;ters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the &s;ubject. Ma&s;ters are always and every where in a &s;ort of tacit, but con&s;tant and uniform combination, not to
<PB N="82" REF="93">
rai&s;e the wages of labour above their actual rate. To violate this combination is every where a mo&s;t unpopular action, and a &s;ort of reproach to a ma&s;ter among his neighbours and equals. We &s;eldom, indeed, hear of this combination, becau&s;e it is the u&s;ual, and one may &s;ay, the natural &s;tate of things which nobody ever hears of. Ma&s;ters too &s;ometimes enter into particular combina|tions to &s;ink the wages of labour even below this rate. The&s;e are always conducted with the utmo&s;t &s;ilence and &s;ecrecy, till the moment of execution, and when the workmen yield, as they &s;ome|times do, without re&s;i&s;tance, though &s;everely felt by them, they are never heard of by other people. Such combinations, however, are frequently re&s;i&s;ted by a contrary defen&s;ive combination of the workmen; who &s;ometimes too, without any provocation of this kind, combine of their own accord to rai&s;e the price of their la|bour. Their u&s;ual pretences are, &s;ometimes, the high price of pro|vi&s;ions; &s;ometimes the great profit which their ma&s;ters make by their work. But whether their combinations be offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive they are always abundantly heard of. In order to bring the point to a &s;peedy deci&s;ion, they have always recour&s;e to the loude&s;t cla|mour, and &s;ometimes to the mo&s;t &s;hocking violence and outrage. They are de&s;perate, and act with the folly and extravagance of de&s;|perate men, who mu&s;t &s;tarve or frighten their ma&s;ters into an im|mediate compliance with their demands. The ma&s;ters upon the&s;e occa&s;ions are ju&s;t as clamorous upon the other &s;ide, and never cea&s;e to call aloud for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the civil magi&s;trate, and the rigorous execution of tho&s;e laws which have been enacted with &s;o+much &s;everity again&s;t the combinations of &s;ervants, labourers, and journeymen. The workmen, accordingly, very &s;eldom derive any advantage from the violence of tho&s;e tumultuous combinations, which, partly from the interpo&s;ition of the civil magi&s;trate, partly from the &s;uperior &s;teadine&s;s of the ma&s;ters, partly from the ne|ce&s;&s;ity which the greater part of the workmen are under of &s;ub|mitting
<PB N="83" REF="94">
for the &s;ake of pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, generally end in no|thing, but the puni&s;hment or ruin of the ringleaders.</P>
<P>BUT though in di&s;putes with their workmen, ma&s;ters mu&s;t generally have the advantage, there is however a certain rate below which it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to reduce, for any con&s;iderable time, the ordinary wages even of the lowe&s;t &s;pecies of labour.</P>
<P>A MAN mu&s;t always live by his work, and his wages mu&s;t at lea&s;t be &s;ufficient to maintain him. They mu&s;t even upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions be &s;omewhat more; otherwi&s;e it would be impo&s;&s;ible to bring up a family, and the race of &s;uch workmen could not la&s;t beyond the fir&s;t generation. Mr. Cantillon &s;eems, upon this ac|count, to &s;uppo&s;e that the lowe&s;t &s;pecies of common labourers mu&s;t every where earn at lea&s;t double their own maintenance, in order that one with another they may be enabled to bring up two children; the labour of the wife, on account of her nece&s;&s;ary at|tendance on the children, being &s;uppo&s;ed no more than &s;ufficient to provide for her&s;elf. But one-half the children born, it is com|puted, die before the age of manhood. The poore&s;t labourers, therefore, according to this account, mu&s;t, one with another, attempt to rear at lea&s;t four children, in order that two may have an equal chance of living to that age. But the nece&s;&s;ary maintenance of four children, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, may be nearly equal to that of one man. The labour of an able-bodied &s;lave, the &s;ame author adds, is computed to be worth double his maintenance; and that of the meane&s;t labourer, he thinks, cannot be worth le&s;s than that of an able-bodied &s;lave. Thus far at lea&s;t &s;eems certain, that, in order to bring up a family, the labour of the hu&s;band and wife together mu&s;t, even in the lowe&s;t &s;pecies of common labour, be able to earn &s;omething more than what is preci&s;ely nece&s;&s;ary for their own maintenance; but in what proportion, whether in that above
<PB N="84" REF="95">
mentioned, or in any other, I &s;hall not take upon me to deter|mine.</P>
<P>THERE are certain circum&s;tances, however, which &s;ometimes give the labourers an advantage, and enable them to rai&s;e their wages con&s;iderably above this rate; evidently the lowe&s;t which is con&s;i&s;tent with common humanity.</P>
<P>WHEN in any country the demand for tho&s;e who live by wages; labourers, journeymen, &s;ervants of every kind, is continually in|crea&s;ing; when every year furni&s;hes employment for a greater number than had been employed the year before, the workmen have no occa&s;ion to combine in order to rai&s;e their wages. The &s;carcity of hands occa&s;ions a competition among ma&s;ters, who bid again&s;t one another in order to get them, and thus voluntarily break through the natural combination of ma&s;ters not to rai&s;e wages.</P>
<P>THE demand for tho&s;e who live by wages, it is evident, cannot increa&s;e but in proportion to the increa&s;e of the funds which are de&s;tined for the payment of wages. The&s;e funds are of two kinds; fir&s;t, the revenue which is over and above what is nece&s;&s;ary for the maintenance; and, &s;econdly, the &s;tock which is over and above what is nece&s;&s;ary for the employment of their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>WHEN the landlord, annuitant, or monied man, has a greater revenue than what he judges &s;ufficient to maintain his own family, he employs either the whole or a part of the &s;urplus in maintaining one or more menial &s;ervants. Increa&s;e this &s;urplus, and he will naturally increa&s;e the number of tho&s;e &s;ervants.</P>
<P>WHEN an independant workman, &s;uch as a weaver or &s;hoe|maker, has got more &s;tock than what is &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e
<PB N="85" REF="96">
the materials of his own work, and to maintain him&s;elf till he can di&s;po&s;e of it, he naturally employs one or more journeymen with the &s;urplus, in order to make a profit by their work. In|crea&s;e this &s;urplus, and he will naturally increa&s;e the number of his journeymen.</P>
<P>THE demand for tho&s;e who live by wages, therefore, nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;es with the increa&s;e of the revenue and &s;tock of every coun|try, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly increa&s;e without it. The increa&s;e of revenue and &s;tock is the increa&s;e of national wealth. The demand for tho&s;e who live by wages, therefore, naturally increa&s;es with the increa&s;e of national wealth, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly increa&s;e with|out it.</P>
<P>IT is not the actual greatne&s;s of national wealth, but its con|tinual increa&s;e, which occa&s;ions a ri&s;e in the wages of labour. It is not, accordingly, in the riche&s;t countries, but in the mo&s;t thriving or in tho&s;e which are growing rich the fa&s;te&s;t, that the wages of labour are highe&s;t. England is certainly, in the pre&s;ent times, a much richer country than any part of North America. The wages of labour, however, are much higher in North America than in any part of England. In the province of New York, common labourers earn three &s;hillings and &s;ixpence currency, equal to two &s;hillings &s;terling, a day; &s;hip carpenters, ten &s;hillings and &s;ixpence currency, with a pint of rum worth &s;ixpence &s;terling, equal in all to &s;ix &s;hillings and &s;ixpence &s;terling; hou&s;e carpenters and bricklayers, eight &s;hillings currency, equal to four &s;hillings and &s;ixpence &s;terling; journeymen taylors, five &s;hillings currency, equal to about two &s;hillings and ten-pence &s;terling. The&s;e prices are all above the London price; and wages are &s;aid to be as high in the other colonies as in New York. The price of provi&s;ions is every where in North America much lower than in England. A dearth has never been known there. In the wor&s;t &s;ea&s;ons, they
<PB N="86" REF="97">
have always had a &s;ufficiency for them&s;elves, though le&s;s for expor|tation. If the money price of labour, therefore, be higher than it is any where in the mother country, its real price, the real com|mand of the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life which it conveys to the labourer, mu&s;t be higher in a &s;till greater proportion.</P>
<P>BUT though North America is not yet &s;o rich as England, it is much more thriving, and advancing with much greater rapidity to the further acqui&s;ition of riches. The mo&s;t deci&s;ive mark of the pro&s;perity of any country is the increa&s;e of the number of its inhabitants. In Great Britain and mo&s;t other European countries they are not &s;uppo&s;ed to double in le&s;s than five hundred years. In the Briti&s;h colonies in North America, it has been found, that they double in twenty or five and twenty years. Nor in the pre&s;ent times is this increa&s;e principally owing to the continual importation of new inhabitants, but to the great multiplication of the &s;pecies. Tho&s;e who live to old age, it is &s;aid, frequently &s;ee there from fifty to a hundred, and &s;ometimes many more, de&s;cend|ants from their own body. Labour is there &s;o well rewarded that a numerous family of children, in&s;tead of being a burthen, is a &s;ource of opulence and pro&s;perity to the parents. The labour of each child, before it can leave their hou&s;e, is computed to be worth a hundred pounds clear gain to them. A young widow with four or five young children, who, among the middling or inferior ranks of people in Europe, would have &s;o little chance for a &s;econd hu&s;band, is there frequently courted as a &s;ort of fortune. The value of children is the greate&s;t of all encouragements to marriage. We cannot, therefore, wonder that the people in North America &s;hould generally marry very young. Notwith&s;tanding the great increa&s;e occa&s;ioned by &s;uch early marriages, there is a continual complaint of the &s;carcity of hands in North America. The demand for labourers, the funds de&s;tined for maintaining them, increa&s;e, it &s;eems, &s;till fa&s;ter than they can find labourers to employ.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="98">
THOUGH the wealth of a country &s;hould be very great, yet if it has been long &s;tationary, we mu&s;t not expect to find the wages of labour very high in it. The funds de&s;tined for the pay|ment of wages, the revenue and &s;tock of its inhabitants, may be of the greate&s;t extent, but if they have continued for &s;everal cen|turies of the &s;ame, or very nearly of the &s;ame extent, the number of labourers employed every year could ea&s;ily &s;upply, and even more than &s;upply, the number wanted the following year. There could &s;eldom be any &s;carcity of hands, nor could the ma&s;ters be obliged to bid again&s;t one another in order to get them. The hands, on the contrary, would, in this ca&s;e, naturally multiply beyond their employment. There would be a con&s;tant &s;carcity of employment, and the labourers would be obliged to bid again&s;t one another in order to get it. If in &s;uch a country the wages of labour had ever been more than &s;ufficient to maintain the labourer and to enable him to bring up a family, the competition of the labourers and the intere&s;t of the ma&s;ters would &s;oon reduce them to this lowe&s;t rate which is con&s;i&s;tent with common humanity. China has been long one of the riche&s;t, that is, one of the mo&s;t fertile, be&s;t cultivated, mo&s;t indu&s;trious and mo&s;t populous countries in the world. It &s;eems, however, to have been long &s;tationary. Marco Polo, who vi&s;ited it more than five hundred years ago, de&s;cribes its cultivation, indu&s;try and populou&s;ne&s;s almo&s;t in the &s;ame terms in which they are de|&s;cribed by travellers in the pre&s;ent times. It had perhaps even long before his time acquired that full complement of riches which the nature of its laws and in&s;titutions permits it to acquire. The accounts of all travellers, incon&s;i&s;tent in many other re&s;pects, agree in the low wages of labour, and in the difficulty which a labourer finds in bringing up a family in China. If by digging the ground a whole day he can get what will purcha&s;e a &s;mall quantity of rice in the evening, he is contented. The condition of artificers is, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till wor&s;e. In&s;tead of waiting indolently in their work|hou&s;es,
<PB N="88" REF="99">
for the calls of their cu&s;tomers, as in Europe, they are continually running about the &s;treets with the tools of their re&s;pective trades, offering their &s;ervice, and as it were begging employment. The poverty of the lower ranks of people in China far &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of the mo&s;t beggarly nations in Europe. In the neighbourhood of Canton many hundred, it is commonly &s;aid, many thou&s;and families have no habitation on the land, but live con&s;tantly in little fi&s;hing boats upon the rivers and canals. The &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which they find there is &s;o &s;canty that they are eager to fi&s;h up the na&s;tie&s;t garbage thrown overboard from any European &s;hip. Any carrion, the carca&s;e of a dead dog or cat, for example, though half putrid and &s;tinking, is as welcome to them as the mo&s;t whole&s;ome food to the people of other countries. Marriage is encouraged in China, not by the profitablene&s;s of children, but by the liberty of de&s;troying them. In all great towns &s;everal are every night expo&s;ed in the &s;treet or drowned like puppies in the water. The performance of this horrid office is even &s;aid to be the avowed bu&s;ine&s;s by which &s;ome people earn their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>CHINA, however, though it may perhaps &s;tand &s;till, does not &s;eem to go backwards. Its towns are nowhere de&s;erted by their inhabitants. The lands which had once been cultivated are no|where neglected. The &s;ame or very nearly the &s;ame annual labour mu&s;t therefore continue to be performed, and the funds de&s;tined for maintaining it mu&s;t not, con&s;equently, be &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hed. The lowe&s;t cla&s;s of labourers, therefore, notwith&s;tanding their &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, mu&s;t &s;ome way or another make &s;hift to continue their race &s;o far as to keep up their u&s;ual numbers.</P>
<P>BUT it would be otherwi&s;e in a country where the funds de&s;tined for the maintenance of labour were &s;en&s;ibly decaying. Every year the demand for &s;ervants and labourers would, in all the different
<PB N="89" REF="100">
cla&s;&s;es of employments, be le&s;s than it had been the year before. Many who had been bred in the &s;uperior cla&s;&s;es, not being able to find employment in their own bu&s;ine&s;s, would be glad to &s;eek it in the lowe&s;t. The lowe&s;t cla&s;s being not only over&s;tocked with its own workmen, but with the overflowings of all the other cla&s;&s;es, the competition for employment would be &s;o great in it, as to reduce the wages of labour to the mo&s;t mi&s;erable and &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the labourer. Many would not be able to find employment even upon the&s;e hard terms, but would either &s;tarve, or be driven to &s;eek a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence either by begging, or by the perpetration perhaps of the greate&s;t enormities. Want, famine, and mortality would immediately prevail in that cla&s;s, and from thence extend them&s;elves to all the &s;uperior cla&s;&s;es, till the number of inhabitants in the country was reduced to what could ea&s;ily be maintained by the revenue and &s;tock which remained in it, and which had e&s;caped either the tyranny or calamity which had de&s;troyed the re&s;t. This perhaps is nearly the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Bengal, and of &s;ome other of the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements in the Ea&s;t Indies. In a fertile country which had before been much depopulated, where &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, con|&s;equently, &s;hould not be very difficult, and where, notwith&s;tanding, three or four hundred thou&s;and people die of hunger in one year, we may be a&s;&s;ured that the funds de&s;tined for the maintenance of the labouring poor are fa&s;t decaying. The difference between the genius of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution which protects and governs North America, and that of the mercantile company which oppre&s;&s;es and domineers in the Ea&s;t Indies, cannot perhaps be better illu&s;|trated than by the different &s;tate of tho&s;e countries.</P>
<P>THE liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it is the nece&s;&s;ary effect, &s;o it is the natural &s;ymptom of increa&s;ing national wealth. The &s;canty maintenance of the labouring poor, on the other hand, is the natural &s;ymptom that things are at a &s;tand, and their &s;tar|ving condition that they are going fa&s;t backwards.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="101">
IN Great Britain the wages of labour &s;eem, in the pre&s;ent times, to be evidently more than what is preci&s;ely nece&s;&s;ary to enable the labourer to bring up a family. In order to &s;atisfy our&s;elves upon this point it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to enter into any tedious or doubtful calculation of what may be the lowe&s;t &s;um upon which it is po&s;&s;ible to do this. There are many plain &s;ymptoms that the wages of labour are nowhere in this country regulated by this lowe&s;t rate which is con&s;i&s;tent with common humanity.</P>
<P>FIRST, in almo&s;t every part of Great Britain there is a di&s;|tinction, even in the lowe&s;t &s;pecies of labour, between &s;ummer and winter wages. Summer wages are always highe&s;t. But on account of the extraordinary expence of fewel, the maintenance of a family is mo&s;t expen&s;ive in winter. Wages, therefore, being highe&s;t when this expence is lowe&s;t, it &s;eems evident that they are not regulated by what is nece&s;&s;ary for this expence; but by the quan|tity and &s;uppo&s;ed value of the work. A labourer, it may be &s;aid indeed, ought to &s;ave part of his &s;ummer wages in order to defray his winter expence; and that through the whole year they do not exceed what is nece&s;&s;ary to maintain his family through the whole year. A &s;lave, however, or one ab&s;olutely dependent on us for immediate &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, would not be treated in this manner. His daily &s;ub&s;i&s;tence would be proportioned to his daily nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, the wages of labour do not in Great Britain fluc|tuate with the price of provi&s;ions. The&s;e vary everywhere from year to year, frequently from month to month. But in many places the money price of labour remains uniformly the &s;ame &s;ometimes for half a century together. If in the&s;e places, there|fore, the labouring poor can maintain their families in dear years, they mu&s;t be at their ea&s;e in times of moderate plenty, and in affluence in tho&s;e of extraordinary cheapne&s;s. The high price of provi&s;ions during the&s;e ten years pa&s;t has not in many parts of the
<PB N="91" REF="102">
kingdom been accompanied with any &s;en&s;ible ri&s;e in the money price of labour. It has, indeed, in &s;ome; owing probably more to the increa&s;e of the demand for labour than to that of the price of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, as the price of provi&s;ions varies more from year to year than the wages of labour, &s;o, on the other hand, the wages of labour vary more from place to place than the price of pro|vi&s;ions. The prices of bread and butcher's meat are generally the &s;ame or very nearly the &s;ame through the greater part of the united kingdom. The&s;e and mo&s;t other things which are &s;old by retail, the way in which the labouring poor buy all things, are generally fully as cheap or cheaper in great towns than in the remoter parts of the country, for rea&s;ons which I &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion to explain hereafter. But the wages of labour in a great town and its neighbourhood are frequently a fourth or a fifth part, twenty or five and twenty per cent higher than at a few miles di&s;tance. Eighteen pence a day may be reckoned the common price of labour in London and its neighbourhood. At a few miles di&s;tance it falls to fourteen and fifteen pence. Ten-pence may be reckoned its price in Edinburgh and its neighbourhood. At a few miles di&s;tance it falls to eight pence, the u&s;ual price of com|mon labour through the greater part of the low country of Scot|land, where it varies a good deal le&s;s than in England. Such a difference of prices, which it &s;eems is not always &s;ufficient to tran&s;port a man from one pari&s;h to another, would nece&s;&s;arily oc|ca&s;ion &s;o great a tran&s;portation of the mo&s;t bulky commodities, not only from one pari&s;h to another, but from one end of the kingdom, almo&s;t from one end of the world to the other, as would &s;oon reduce them more nearly to a level. After all that has been &s;aid of the levity and incon&s;tancy of human nature, it appears evi|dently from experience that a man is of all &s;orts of luggage the mo&s;t
<PB N="92" REF="103">
difficult to be tran&s;ported. If the labouring poor, therefore, can maintain their families in tho&s;e parts of the kingdom where the price of labour is lowe&s;t, they mu&s;t be in affluence where it is highe&s;t.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, the variations in the price of labour not only do not corre&s;pond either in place or time with tho&s;e in the price of provi&s;ions, but they are frequently quite oppo&s;ite.</P>
<P>GRAIN, the food of the common people, is dearer in Scotland than in England, whence Scotland receives almo&s;t every year very large &s;upplies. But Engli&s;h corn mu&s;t be &s;old dearer in Scotland, the country to which it is brought, than in England, the country from which it comes; and in proportion to its quality it cannot be &s;old dearer in Scotland than the Scotch corn that comes to the &s;ame market in competition with it. The quality of grain depends chiefly upon the quantity of flour or meal which it yields at the mill, and in this re&s;pect Engli&s;h grain is &s;o much &s;uperior to the Scotch that, though often dearer in appearance, or in proportion to the mea|&s;ure of its bulk, it is generally cheaper in reality or in proportion to its quality, or even to the mea&s;ure of its weight. The price of labour, on the contrary, is dearer in England than in Scotland. If the labouring poor, therefore, can maintain their families in the one part of the united kingdom, they mu&s;t be in affluence in the other. Oatmeal indeed &s;upplies the common people in Scotland with the greate&s;t and the be&s;t part of their food, which is in general much inferior to that of their neighbours of the &s;ame rank in England. This difference, however, in the mode of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is not the cau&s;e, but the effect of the difference in their wages; though, by a &s;trange mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, I have fre|quently heard it repre&s;ented as the cau&s;e. It is not becau&s;e one man keeps a coach while his neighbour walks a-foot, that the
<PB N="93" REF="104">
one is rich and the other poor; but becau&s;e the one is rich he keeps a coach, and becau&s;e the other is poor he walks a-foot.</P>
<P>DURING the cour&s;e of the la&s;t century, taking one year with another, grain was dearer in both parts of the united kingdom than during that of the pre&s;ent. This is a matter of fact which cannot now admit of any rea&s;onable doubt; and the proof of it is, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more deci&s;ive with regard to Scotland than with regard to England. It is in Scotland &s;upported by the evi|dence of the publick fiars, annual valuations made upon oath, according to the actual &s;tate of the markets, of all the different &s;orts of grain in every different county of Scotland. If &s;uch direct proof could require any collateral evidence to confirm it, I would ob&s;erve that this has likewi&s;e been the ca&s;e in France, and probably in mo&s;t other parts of Europe. With regard to France there is the cleare&s;t proof. But though it is certain that in both parts of the united kingdom grain was &s;omewhat dearer in the la&s;t century than in the pre&s;ent, it is equally certain that labour was much cheaper. If the labouring poor, therefore, could bring up their families then, they mu&s;t be much more at their ea&s;e now. In the la&s;t century, the mo&s;t u&s;ual day-wages of common labour through the greater part of Scotland were &s;ixpence in &s;ummer and five-pence in winter. Three &s;hillings a week, the &s;ame price very nearly, &s;till continues to be paid in &s;ome parts of the High|lands and we&s;tern I&s;lands. Through the greater part of the low country the mo&s;t u&s;ual wages of common labour are now eight|pence a day; ten-pence, &s;ometimes a &s;hilling about Edinburgh, in the countries which border upon England, probably on account of that neighbourhood, and in a few other places where there has lately been a con&s;iderable ri&s;e in the demand for labour, about Gla&s;gow, Carron, Ayr-&s;hire, &amp;c. In England the improvements of agriculture, manufactures and commerce began much earlier
<PB N="94" REF="105">
than in Scotland. The demand for labour, and con&s;equently its price, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have increa&s;ed with tho&s;e improvements. In the la&s;t century, accordingly, as well as in the pre&s;ent, the wages of labour were higher in England than in Scotland. They have ri&s;en too con&s;iderably &s;ince that time, though on account of the greater variety of wages paid there in different places, it is more difficult to a&s;certain how much. In 1614, the pay of a foot &s;oldier was the &s;ame as in the pre&s;ent times, eight pence a day. When it was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed it would naturally be regulated by the u&s;ual wages of common labourers, the rank of people from which foot &s;oldiers are commonly drawn. Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Hales, who wrote in the time of Charles II. computes the nece&s;&s;ary expence of a labourer's family, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix per&s;ons, the father and mother, two children able to do &s;omething, and two not able, at ten &s;hillings a week, or twenty-&s;ix pounds a year. If they can|not earn this by their labour, they mu&s;t make it up, he &s;uppo&s;es, either by begging or &s;tealing. He appears to have enquired very carefully into this &s;ubject. In 1688, Mr. Gregory King, who&s;e &s;kill in political arithmetick is &s;o much extolled by Doctor Dave|nant, computed the ordinary income of labourers and out-&s;ervants to be fifteen pounds a year to a family, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t, one with another, of three and a half per&s;ons. His cal|culation, therefore, though different in appearance, corre&s;ponds very nearly at bottom with that of judge Hales. Both &s;uppo&s;e the weekly expence of &s;uch families to be about twenty-pence a head. Both the pecuniary income and expence of &s;uch families have increa&s;ed con&s;iderably &s;ince that time through the greater part of the kingdom; in &s;ome places more, and in &s;ome le&s;s; though perhaps &s;carce any where &s;o much as &s;ome exaggerated accounts of the pre&s;ent wages of labour have lately repre&s;ented them to the publick. The price of labour, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, cannot be a&s;certained very accurately anywhere, different prices
<PB N="95" REF="106">
being often paid at the &s;ame place and for the &s;ame &s;ort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the ea&s;ine&s;s or hardne&s;s of the ma&s;ters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to deter|mine is what are the mo&s;t u&s;ual; and experience &s;eems to &s;how that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do &s;o.</P>
<P>THE real recompence of labour, the real quantity of the ne|ce&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life which it can procure to the labourer, has, during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century, increa&s;ed perhaps in a &s;till greater proportion than its money price. Not only grain has become &s;omewhat cheaper, but many other things from which the indu&s;trious poor derive an agreeable and whole|&s;ome variety of food, have become a great deal cheaper. Potatoes, for example, do not at pre&s;ent, through the greater part of the kingdom, co&s;t half the price which they u&s;ed to do thirty or forty years ago. The &s;ame thing may be &s;aid of turnips, carrots, cabbages; things which were formerly never rai&s;ed but by the &s;pade, but which are now commonly rai&s;ed by the plough. All &s;ort of garden &s;tuff too has become cheaper. The greater part of the apples and even of the onions con&s;umed in Great Britain were in the la&s;t century imported from Flanders. The great im|provements in the coar&s;er manufactures of both linen and woollen cloth furni&s;h the labourers with cheaper and better cloathing; and tho&s;e in the manufactures of the coar&s;er metals, with cheaper and better in&s;truments of trade, as well as with many agreeable and convenient pieces of hou&s;ehold furniture. Soap, &s;alt, can|dles, leather, and fermented liquors have, indeed, become a good deal dearer; chiefly from the taxes which have been laid upon them. The quantity of the&s;e however which the labouring poor are under any nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;uming, is &s;o very &s;mall that
<PB N="96" REF="107">
the increa&s;e in their price does not compen&s;ate the diminution in that of &s;o many other things. The common complaint that luxury extends it&s;elf even to the lowe&s;t ranks of the people, and that the labouring poor will not now be contented with the &s;ame food, cloathing and lodging which &s;atisfied them in former times, may convince us that it is not the money price of labour only, but its real recompence which has augmented.</P>
<P>Is this improvement in the circum&s;tances of the lower ranks of the people to be regarded as an advantage or as an inconveniency to the &s;ociety? The an&s;wer &s;eems at fir&s;t &s;ight abundantly plain. Servants, labourers and workmen of different kinds, make up the far greater part of every great political &s;ociety. But what improves the circum&s;tances of the greater part can never be re|garded as an inconveniency to the whole. No &s;ociety can &s;urely be flouri&s;hing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and mi&s;erable. It is but equity, be&s;ides, that they who feed, cloath and lodge the whole body of the people, &s;hould have &s;uch a &s;hare of the produce of their own labour as to be them&s;elves tolerably well fed, cloathed and lodged.</P>
<P>POVERTY, though it no doubt di&s;courages, does not always prevent marriage. It &s;eems even to be favourable to generation. A half &s;tarved Highland woman frequently bears more than twenty children, while a pampered fine lady is often incapable of bearing any, and is generally exhau&s;ted by two or three. Bar|renne&s;s, &s;o frequent among women of fa&s;hion, is very rare among tho&s;e of inferior &s;tation. Luxury in the fair &s;ex, while it enflames perhaps the pa&s;&s;ion for enjoyment, &s;eems always to weaken and frequently to de&s;troy altogether the powers of generation.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="108">
BUT poverty, though it does not prevent the generation, is extreamly unfavourable to the rearing of children. The tender plant is produced, but in &s;o cold a &s;oil and &s;o &s;evere a climate, &s;oon withers and dies. It is not uncommon, I have been frequently told, in the Highlands of Scotland for a mother who has borne twenty children not to have two alive. Several officers of great experience have a&s;&s;ured me that &s;o far from recruiting their regi|ment, they have never been able to &s;upply it with drums and fifes from all the &s;oldiers children that were born in it. A greater number of fine children, however, is &s;eldom &s;een anywhere than about a barrack of &s;oldiers. Very few of them, it &s;eems, arrive at the age of thirteen or fourteen. In &s;ome places one half the children born die before they are four years of age; in many places before they are &s;even; and in almo&s;t all places before they are nine or ten. This great mortality, however, will every where be found chiefly among the children of the common people, who cannot afford to tend them with the &s;ame care as tho&s;e of better &s;tation. Though their marriages are generally more fruitful than tho&s;e of people of fa&s;hion, a &s;maller proportion of their children arrive at maturity. In foundling ho&s;pitals, and among the children brought up by pari&s;h charities the mortality is &s;till greater than among tho&s;e of the common people.</P>
<P>EVERY &s;pecies of animals naturally multiplies in proportion to the means of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and no &s;pecies can ever mul|tiply beyond it. But in civilized &s;ociety it is only among the inferior ranks of people that the &s;cantine&s;s of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence can &s;et limits to the further multiplication of the human &s;pecies; and it can do &s;o in no other way than by de&s;troying a great part of the children which their fruitful marriages produce.</P>
<P>THE liberal reward of labour, by enabling them to provide better for their children, and con&s;equently to bring up a greater number,
<PB N="96" REF="109">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="97" REF="110">

<PB N="98" REF="111">
naturally tends to widen and extend tho&s;e limits. It de&s;erves to be remarked too, that it nece&s;&s;arily does this as nearly as po&s;|&s;ible in the proportion which the demand for labour requires. If this demand is continually increa&s;ing, the reward of labour mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily encourage in &s;uch a manner the marriage and multiplication of labourers, as may enable them to &s;upply that continually increa&s;ing demand by a continually increa&s;ing popu|lation. If it &s;hould at any time be le&s;s than what was requi&s;ite for this purpo&s;e, the deficiency of hands would &s;oon rai&s;e it; and if it &s;hould at any time be more, their exce&s;&s;ive multiplication would &s;oon lower it to this nece&s;&s;ary rate. The market would be &s;o much under&s;tocked with labour in the one ca&s;e, and &s;o much over&s;tocked in the other, as would &s;oon force back its price to that proper rate which the circum&s;tances of the &s;ociety required. It is in this manner that the demand for men, like that for any other commodity, nece&s;&s;arily regulates the production of men; quickens it when it goes on too &s;lowly, and &s;tops it when it advances too fa&s;t. It is this demand which regulates and deter|mines the &s;tate of propagation in all the different countries of the world, in North America, in Europe, and in China; which renders it rapidly progre&s;&s;ive in the fir&s;t, &s;low and gradual in the &s;econd, and altogether &s;tationary in the la&s;t.</P>
<P>THE tear and wear of a &s;lave, it has been &s;aid, is at the expence of his ma&s;ter; but that of a free &s;ervant is at his own expence. The tear and wear of the latter, however, is, in reality, as much at the expence of his ma&s;ter as that of the former. The wages paid to journeymen and &s;ervants of every kind mu&s;t be &s;uch as may enable them, one with another, to continue the race of journey|men and &s;ervants, according as the increa&s;ing, dimini&s;hing, or &s;tationary demand of the &s;ociety may happen to require. But though the tear and wear of a free &s;ervant be equally at the expence
<PB N="99" REF="112">
of his ma&s;ter, it generally co&s;ts him much le&s;s than that of a &s;lave. The fund de&s;tined for replacing or repairing, if I may &s;ay &s;o, the tear and wear of the &s;lave, is commonly managed by a negligent ma&s;ter or carele&s;s over&s;eer. That de&s;tined for perform|ing the &s;ame office with regard to the free man, is managed by the free man him&s;elf. The di&s;orders which generally prevail in the oeconomy of the rich, naturally introduce them&s;elves into the management of the former: The &s;trict frugality and par&s;imonious attention of the poor as naturally e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in that of the latter. Under &s;uch different management, the &s;ame pur|po&s;e mu&s;t require very different degrees of expence to execute it. It appears, accordingly, from the experience of all ages and na|tions, I believe, that the work done by freemen comes cheaper in the end than that performed by &s;laves. It is found to do &s;o even at Bo&s;ton, New York, and Philadelphia, where the wages of common labour are &s;o very high.</P>
<P>THE liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it is the effect of increa&s;ing wealth, &s;o it is the cau&s;e of increa&s;ing population. To complain of it is to lament over the nece&s;&s;ary effect and cau&s;e of the greate&s;t publick pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>IT de&s;erves to be remarked, perhaps, that it is in the progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate, while the &s;ociety is advancing to the further acqui&s;ition, rather than when it has acquired its full complement of riches, that the condition of the labouring poor, of the great body of the peo|ple, &s;eems to be the happie&s;t and the mo&s;t comfortable. It is hard in the &s;tationary, and mi&s;erable in the declining &s;tate. The pro|gre&s;&s;ive &s;tate is in reality the chearful and the hearty &s;tate to all the different orders of the &s;ociety. The &s;tationary is dull; the declining, melancholy.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="113">
THE liberal reward of labour, as it encourages the propagation, &s;o it increa&s;es the indu&s;try of the common people. The wages of labour are the encouragement of indu&s;try, which, like every other human quality, improves in proportion to the encouragement it receives. A plentiful &s;ub&s;i&s;tence increa&s;es the bodily &s;trength of the labourer, and the comfortable hope of bettering his condition, and of ending his days perhaps in ea&s;e and plenty, animates him to exert that &s;trength to the utmo&s;t. Where wages are high, ac|cordingly, we &s;hall always find the workmen more active, diligent, and expeditions, than where they are low; in England, for ex|ample, than in Scotland; in the neighbourhood of great towns, than in remote country places. Some workmen, indeed, when they can earn in four days what will maintain them through the week, will be idle the other three. This, however, is by no means the ca&s;e with the greater part. Workmen, on the contrary, when they are liberally paid by the piece, are very apt to over-work them&s;elves, and to ruin their health and con&s;titution in a few years. A carpenter in London, and in &s;ome other places, is not &s;uppo&s;ed to la&s;t in his utmo&s;t vigour above eight years. Some|thing of the &s;ame kind happens in many other trades, in which the workmen are paid by the piece; as they generally are in manu|factures, and even in country labour, wherever wages are higher than ordinary. Almo&s;t every cla&s;s of artificers is &s;ubject to &s;ome peculiar infirmity occa&s;ioned by exce&s;&s;ive application to their pe|culiar &s;pecies of work. Ramuzzini, an eminent Italian phy&s;ician, has written a particular book concerning &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es. We do not reckon our &s;oldiers the mo&s;t indu&s;trious &s;et of people among us. Yet when &s;oldiers have been employed in &s;ome particular &s;orts of work, and liberally paid by the piece, their officers have frequently been obliged to &s;tipulate with the undertaker, that they &s;hould not be allowed to earn above a certain &s;um every day, according to the rate at which they were paid. Till this &s;tipulation was made,
<PB N="101" REF="114">
mutual emulation and the de&s;ire of greater gain, frequently prompt|ed them to over-work them&s;elves, and to hurt their health by exce&s;&s;ive labour. Exce&s;&s;ive application during four days of the week, is frequently the real cau&s;e of the idlene&s;s of the other three, &s;o much and &s;o loudly complained of. Great labour, either of mind or body, continued for &s;everal days together, is in mo&s;t men naturally followed by a great de&s;ire of relaxation, which, if not re&s;trained by force or by &s;ome &s;trong nece&s;&s;ity, is almo&s;t ir|re&s;i&s;table. It is the call of nature, which requires to be relieved by &s;ome indulgence, &s;ometimes of ea&s;e only, but &s;ometimes too of di&s;&s;ipation and diver&s;ion. If it is not complied with, the con&s;e|quences are often dangerous, and &s;ometimes fatal, and &s;uch as almo&s;t always, &s;ooner or later, bring on the peculiar infirmity of the trade. If ma&s;ters would always li&s;ten to the dictates of rea&s;on and humanity, they have frequently occa&s;ion rather to moderate, than to animate the application of many of their workmen. It will be found, I believe, in every &s;ort of trade, that the man who works &s;o moderately, as to be able to work con&s;tantly, not only pre&s;erves his health the longe&s;t, but, in the cour&s;e of the year, executes the greate&s;t quantity of work.</P>
<P>IN cheap years, it is pretended, workmen are generally more idle, and in dear ones more indu&s;trious than ordinary. A plen|tiful &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, therefore, it has been concluded, relaxes, and a &s;canty one quickens their indu&s;try. That a little more plenty than ordinary may render &s;ome workmen idle, cannot well be doubted; but that it &s;hould have this effect upon the greater part, or that men in general &s;hould work better when they are ill fed than when they are well fed, when they are di&s;heartened than when they are in good &s;pirits, when they are frequently &s;ick than when they are generally in good health, &s;eems not very probable. Years of dearth, it is to be ob&s;erved, are generally among the common
<PB N="102" REF="115">
people years of &s;ickne&s;s and mortality, which cannot fail to dimi|ni&s;h the produce of their indu&s;try.</P>
<P>IN years of plenty, &s;ervants frequently leave their ma&s;ters, and tru&s;t their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to what they can make by their own indu&s;try. But the &s;ame cheapne&s;s of provi&s;ions, by increa&s;ing the fund which is de&s;tined for the maintenance of &s;ervants, encourages ma&s;ters, farmers e&s;pecially, to employ a greater number. Farmers upon &s;uch occa&s;ions expect more profit from their corn by maintaining a few more labouring &s;ervants, than by &s;elling it at a low price in the market. The demand for &s;ervants increa&s;es, while the number of tho&s;e who offer to &s;upply that demand dimini&s;hes. The price of labour, therefore, frequently ri&s;es in cheap years.</P>
<P>IN years of &s;carcity, the difficulty and uncertainty of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence make all &s;uch people eager to return to &s;ervice. But the high price of provi&s;ions, by dimini&s;hing the funds de&s;tined for the maintenance of &s;ervants, di&s;po&s;es ma&s;ters rather to dimini&s;h than to increa&s;e the number of tho&s;e they have. In dear years too, poor independant workmen frequently con&s;ume the little &s;tocks with which they had u&s;ed to &s;upply them&s;elves with the materials of their work, and are obliged to become journeymen for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. More people want employment than can ea&s;ily get it; many are willing to take it upon lower terms than ordinary, and the wages of both &s;ervants and journeymen frequently &s;ink in dear years.</P>
<P>MASTERS of all &s;orts, therefore, frequently make better bar|gains with their &s;ervants in dear than in cheap years, and find them more humble and dependant in the former than in the latter. They naturally, therefore, commend the former as more favourable to indu&s;try. Landlords and farmers, be&s;ides, two of the large&s;t cla&s;&s;es of ma&s;ters, have another rea&s;on for being plea&s;ed with dear
<PB N="103" REF="116">
years. The rents of the one and the profits of the other depend very much upon the price of provi&s;ions. Nothing can be more ab&s;urd, however, than to imagine that men in general &s;hould work le&s;s when they work for them&s;elves, than when they work for other people. A poor independant workman will generally be more indu&s;trious than even a journeyman who works by the piece. The one enjoys the whole produce of his own indu&s;try; the other &s;hares it with his ma&s;ter. The one, in his &s;eparate, inde|pendant &s;tate, is le&s;s liable to the temptations of bad company, which in large manufactories &s;o frequently ruin the morals of the other. The &s;uperiority of the independant workman over tho&s;e &s;ervants who are hired by the month or by the year, and who&s;e wages and maintenance are the &s;ame whether they do much or do little, is likely to be &s;till greater. Cheap years tend to increa&s;e the proportion of independant workmen to journeymen and &s;er|vants of all kinds, and dear years to dimini&s;h it.</P>
<P>A FRENCH author of great knowledge and ingenuity, Mr. Me&s;&s;ance, receiver of the tailles in the election of St. Etienne, endeavours to &s;how that the poor do more work in cheap than in dear years, by comparing the quantity and value of the goods made upon tho&s;e different occa&s;ions in three different manufactures; one of coar&s;e woollens carried on at Elbeuf; one of linen, and another of &s;ilk, both which extend through the whole generality of Rouen. It appears from his account, which is copied from the regi&s;ters of the publick offices, that the quantity and value of the goods made in all tho&s;e three manufactures has generally been greater in cheap than in dear years; and that it has always been greate&s;t in the cheape&s;t, and lea&s;t in the deare&s;t years. All the three &s;eem to be &s;tationary manufactures, or which, though their produce may vary &s;omewhat from year to year, are upon the whole nei|ther going backwards nor forwards.</P>

THE manufacture of linen in Scotland, and that of coar&s;e wool|lens in the we&s;t riding of York&s;hire, are growing manufactures, of which the produce is generally, though with &s;ome variations, increa&s;ing both in quantity and value. Upon examining, how|ever, the accounts which have been publi&s;hed of their annual pro|duce, I have not been able to ob&s;erve that its variations have had any &s;en&s;ible connection with the dearne&s;s or cheapne&s;s of the &s;ea|&s;ons. In 1740, a year of great &s;carcity, both manufactures, in|deed, appear to have declined very con&s;iderably. But in 1756, another year of great &s;carcity, the Scotch manufacture made more than ordinary advances. The York&s;hire manufacture, indeed, declined, and its produce did not ri&s;e to what it had been in 1755 till 1766, after the repeal of the American &s;tamp act. In that and the following year it greatly exceeded what it had ever been before, and it has continued to do &s;o ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>THE produce of all great manufactures for di&s;tant &s;ale mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily depend, not &s;o much upon the dearne&s;s or cheapne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;ons in the countries where they are carried on, as upon the circum&s;tances which affect the demand in the countries where they are con&s;umed; upon peace or war, upon the pro&s;perity or de|clen&s;ion of other rival manufactures, and upon the good or bad humour of their principal cu&s;tomers. A great part of the extra|ordinary work, be&s;ides, which is probably done in cheap years, never enters the publick regi&s;ters of manufactures. The men-&s;ervants who leave their ma&s;ters become independant labourers. The wo|men return to their parents, and commonly &s;pin in order to make cloaths for them&s;elves and their families. Even the independant workmen do not always work for publick &s;ale, but are employed by &s;ome of their neighbours in manufactures for family u&s;e. The produce of their labour, therefore, frequently makes no figure in tho&s;e publick regi&s;ters of which the records are &s;ometimes pub|li&s;hed
<PB N="105" REF="118">
with &s;o much parade, and from which our merchants and manufacturers would often vainly pretend to anounce the pro&s;perity or declen&s;ion of the greate&s;t empires.</P>
<P>THOUGH the variations in the price of labour, not only do not always corre&s;pond with tho&s;e in the price of provi&s;ions, but are frequently quite oppo&s;ite, we mu&s;t not, upon this account, ima|gine that the price of provi&s;ions has no influence upon that of labour. The money price of labour is nece&s;&s;arily regulated by two circum&s;tances; the demand for labour, and the price of the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life. The demand for labour, according as it happens to be increa&s;ing, &s;tationary, or declining, or to require an increa&s;ing, &s;tationary, or declining population, determines the quantity of the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life which mu&s;t be given to the labourer; and the money price of labour is determined by what is requi&s;ite for purcha&s;ing this quan|tity. Though the money price of labour, therefore, is &s;ometimes high where the price of provi&s;ions is low, it would be &s;till higher, the demand continuing the &s;ame, if the price of provi&s;ions was high.</P>
<P>IT is becau&s;e the demand for labour increa&s;es in years of &s;udden and extraordinary plenty, and dimini&s;hes in tho&s;e of &s;udden and extraordinary &s;carcity, that the money price of labour &s;ometimes ri&s;es in the one, and &s;inks in the other.</P>
<P>IN a year of &s;udden and extraordinary plenty, there are funds in the hands of many of the employers of indu&s;try, &s;ufficient to maintain and employ a greater number of indu&s;trious people than had been employed the year before; and this extraordinary num|ber cannot always be had. Tho&s;e ma&s;ters, therefore, who want more workmen bid again&s;t one another, in order to get them,
<PB N="106" REF="119">
which &s;ometimes rai&s;es both the real and the money price of their labour.</P>
<P>THE contrary of this happens in a year of &s;udden and extraordinary &s;carcity. The funds de&s;tined for employing indu&s;try are le&s;s than they had been the year before. A con&s;iderable number of people are thrown out of employment, who bid again&s;t one another in order to get it, which &s;ometimes lowers both the real and the money price of labour. In 1740, a year of extraordinary &s;carcity, many people were willing to work for bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In the &s;ucceeding years of plenty, it was more difficult to get labourers and &s;ervants.</P>
<P>THE &s;carcity of a dear year, by dimini&s;hing the demand for la|bour, tends to lower its price, as the high price of provi&s;ions tends to rai&s;e it. The plenty of a cheap year, on the contrary, by increa&s;ing the demand, tends to rai&s;e the price of labour, as the cheapne&s;s of provi&s;ions tends to lower it. In the ordinary varia|tions of the price of provi&s;ions, tho&s;e two oppo&s;ite cau&s;es &s;eem to counter-balance one another; which is probably in part the rea&s;on why the wages of labour are every where &s;o much more &s;teady and permanent than the price of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE increa&s;e in the wages of labour nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;es the price of many commodities, by increa&s;ing that part of it which re&s;olves it&s;elf into wages, and &s;o far tends to dimini&s;h their con|&s;umption both at home and abroad. The &s;ame cau&s;e, however, which rai&s;es the wages of labour, the increa&s;e of &s;tock, tends to increa&s;e its productive powers, and to make a &s;maller quantity of labour produce a greater quantity of work. The owner of the &s;tock which employs a great number of labourers, nece&s;&s;arily en|deavours, for his own advantage, to make &s;uch a proper divi&s;ion and di&s;tribution of employment, that they may be enabled to pro|duce
<PB N="107" REF="120">
the greate&s;t quantity of work po&s;&s;ible. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, he endeavours to &s;upply them with the be&s;t machinery which either he or they can think of. What takes place among the labourers in a particular workhou&s;e, takes place, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, among tho&s;e of a great &s;ociety. The greater their number, the more they naturally divide them&s;elves into different cla&s;&s;es and &s;ubdivi&s;ions of employment. More heads are occupied in inventing the mo&s;t proper machinery for executing the work of each, and it is, there|fore, more likely to be invented. There are many commodities, therefore, which, in con&s;equence of the&s;e improvements, come to be produced by &s;o much le&s;s labour than before, that the in|crea&s;e of its price does not compen&s;ate the diminution of its quan|tity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>Of the Profits of Stock.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE ri&s;e and fall in the profits of &s;tock depend upon the &s;ame cau&s;es with the ri&s;e and fall in the wages of labour, the increa&s;ing or declining &s;tate of the wealth of the &s;ociety; but tho&s;e cau&s;es affect the one and the other very differently.</P>
<P>THE increa&s;e of &s;tock, which rai&s;es wages, tends to lower profit. When the &s;tocks of many rich merchants are turned into the &s;ame trade, their mutual competition naturally tends to lower its profit; and when there is a like increa&s;e of &s;tock in all the dif|ferent trades carried on in the &s;ame &s;ociety, the &s;ame competition mu&s;t produce the &s;ame effect in them all.</P>
<P>IT is not ea&s;y, it has already been ob&s;erved, to a&s;certain what are the average wages of labour even in a particular place, and at a particular time. We can, even in this ca&s;e, &s;eldom determine more than what are the mo&s;t u&s;ual wages. But even this can &s;eldom be done with regard to the profits of &s;tock. Profit is &s;o very fluctuating, that the per&s;on who carries on a particular trade cannot always tell you him&s;elf what is the average of his annual profit. It is affected, not only by every variation of price in the commodities which he deals in, but by the good or bad fortune both of his rivals and of his cu&s;tomers, and by a thou&s;and other
<PB N="109" REF="122">
accidents to which goods when carried either by &s;ea or by land, or even when &s;tored in a warehou&s;e, are liable. It varies, therefore, not only from year to year, but from day to day, and almo&s;t from hour to hour. To a&s;certain what is the average profit of all the different trades carried on in a great kingdom, mu&s;t be much more difficult; and to judge of what it may have been formerly, or in remote periods of time, with any degree of preci&s;ion, mu&s;t be al|together impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>BUT though it may be impo&s;&s;ible to determine, with any degree of preci&s;ion, what are or were the average profits of &s;tock, either in the pre&s;ent, or in antient times, &s;ome notion may be formed of them from the intere&s;t of money. It may be laid down as a maxim, that wherever a great deal can be made by the u&s;e of money, a great deal will commonly be given for the u&s;e of it; and that wherever little can be made by it, le&s;s will commonly be given for it. According, therefore, as the u&s;ual market rate of intere&s;t varies in any country, we may be a&s;&s;ured that the ordinary profits of &s;tock mu&s;t vary with it, mu&s;t &s;ink as it &s;inks, and ri&s;e as it ri&s;es. The progre&s;s of intere&s;t, therefore, may lead us to form &s;ome notion of the progre&s;s of profit.</P>
<P>BY the 37th of Henry VIII, all intere&s;t above ten per cent. was declared unlawful. More, it &s;eems, had &s;ometimes been taken before that. In the reign of Edward VI, religious zeal pro|hibited all intere&s;t. This prohibition, however, like all others of the &s;ame kind, is &s;aid to have produced no effect, and probably rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed the evil of u&s;ury. The &s;tatute of Henry VIII was revived by the 13th of Elizabeth cap. 8, and ten per cent. continued to be the legal rate of intere&s;t till the 21&s;t of James I. when it was re&s;tricted to eight per cent. It was reduced
<PB N="110" REF="123">
to &s;ix per cent. &s;oon after the re&s;toration, and by the 12th of Queen Anne, to five per cent. All the&s;e different &s;tatutary regu|lations &s;eem to have been made with great propriety. They &s;eem to have followed and not to have gone before the market rate of intere&s;t, or the rate at which people of good credit u&s;ually borrowed. Since the time of Queen Anne, five per cent. &s;eems to have been rather above than below the market rate. Before the late war, the government borrowed at three per cent.; and people of good credit in the capital, and in many other parts of the kingdom, at three and a half, four, and four and a half per cent.</P>
<P>SINCE the time of Henry VIII, the wealth and revenue of the country have been continually advancing, and, in the cour&s;e of their progre&s;s, their pace &s;eems rather to have been gradually acce|lerated than retarded. They &s;eem, not only to have been going on, but to have been going on fa&s;ter and fa&s;ter. The wages of labour have been continually increa&s;ing during the &s;ame period, and in the greater part of the different branches of trade and manu|factures the profits of &s;tock have been dimini&s;hing.</P>
<P>IT generally requires a greater &s;tock to carry on any &s;ort of trade in a great town than in a country village. The great &s;tocks employed in every branch of trade, and the number of rich com|petitors, generally reduce the rate of profit in the former below what it is in the latter. But the wages of labour are generally higher in a great town than in a country village. In a thriving town the people who have great &s;tocks to employ, frequently can|not get the number of workmen they want, and therefore bid again&s;t one another in order to get as many as they can, which rai&s;es the wages of labour, and lowers the profits of &s;tock. In the remote parts of the country there is frequently not &s;tock &s;ufficient to employ all the people, who therefore bid again&s;t one another in
<PB N="111" REF="124">
order to get employment, which lowers the wages of labour, and rai&s;es the profits of &s;tock.</P>
<P>IN Scotland, though the legal rate of intere&s;t is the &s;ame as in England, the market rate is rather higher. People of the be&s;t credit there &s;eldom borrow under five per cent. Even private bankers in Edinburgh give four per cent. upon their promi&s;&s;ory notes, of which payment either in whole or in part may be de|manded at plea&s;ure. Private bankers in London give no intere&s;t for the money which is depo&s;ited with them. There are few trades which cannot be carried on with a &s;maller &s;tock in Scotland than in England. The common rate of profit, therefore, mu&s;t be &s;omewhat greater. The wages of labour, it has already been ob&s;erved, are lower in Scotland than in England. The country too is not only much poorer, but the &s;teps by which it advances to a better condition, for it is evidently advancing, &s;eem to be much &s;lower and more tardy.</P>
<P>THE legal rate of intere&s;t in France has not, during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century, been always regulated by the market rate. In 1720 intere&s;t was reduced from the twentieth to the fiftieth penny, or from five to two per cent. In 1724 it was rai&s;ed to the thirtieth penny, or to 3&frac13; per cent. In 1725 it was again rai&s;ed to the twentieth penny, or to five per cent. In 1766, during the admini&s;tration of Mr. Laverdy, it was reduced to the twenty-fifth penny, or to four per cent. The Abbe Terray rai&s;ed it afterwards to the old rate of five per cent. The &s;uppo&s;ed purpo&s;e of many of tho&s;e violent reductions of intere&s;t was to prepare the way for reducing that of the public debts; a purpo&s;e which has &s;ometimes been executed. France is perhaps in the pre&s;ent times not &s;o rich a country as England; and though the legal rate of intere&s;t has
<PB N="112" REF="125">
in France frequently been lower than in England, the market rate has generally been higher; for there, as in other countries, they have &s;everal very &s;afe and ea&s;y methods of evading the law. The profits of trade, I have been a&s;&s;ured by Briti&s;h mer|chants who had traded in both countries, are higher in France than in England; and it is no doubt upon this account that many Briti&s;h &s;ubjects chu&s;e rather to employ their capitals in a country where trade is in di&s;grace, than in one where it is highly re&s;pected. The wages of labour are lower in France than in England. When you go from Scotland to England, the difference which you may remark between the dre&s;s and countenance of the common people in the one country and in the other, &s;ufficiently indicates the dif|ference in their condition. The contra&s;t is &s;till greater when you return from France. France, though no doubt a richer country than Scotland, &s;eems not to be going forward &s;o fa&s;t. It is a common and even a popular opinion in the country that it is going backwards; an opinion which, I apprehend, is ill founded even with regard to France, but which nobody can po&s;&s;ibly entertain with regard to Scotland, who &s;ees the country now and who &s;aw it twenty or thirty years ago.</P>
<P>THE province of Holland, on the other hand, in proportion to the extent of its territory and the number of its people, is a richer country than England. The government there borrow at two per cent. and private people of good credit at three. The wages of labour are &s;aid to be higher in Holland than in England; and the Dutch, it is well known, trade upon lower profits than any people in Europe. The trade of Holland, it has been pre|tended by &s;ome people, is decaying, and it may perhaps be true that &s;ome particular branches of it are &s;o. But the&s;e &s;ymptoms &s;eem to indicate &s;ufficiently that there is no general decay. When
<PB N="113" REF="126">
profit dimini&s;hes, merchants are very apt to complain that trade decays; though the diminution of profit is the natural effect of its pro&s;perity, or of a greater &s;tock being employed in it than before. During the late war the Dutch gained the whole carrying trade of France, of which they &s;till retain a very large &s;hare. The great property which they po&s;&s;e&s;s both in the French and Engli&s;h funds, about forty millions, it is &s;aid, in the latter; (in which I &s;u&s;pect, however, there is a con&s;iderable exaggeration), the great &s;ums which they lend to private people in countries where the rate of intere&s;t is higher than in their own, are circum&s;tances which no doubt demon&s;trate the redundancy of their &s;tock, or that it has increa&s;ed beyond what they can employ with tolerable profit in the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of their own country: but they do not demon&s;trate that that bu&s;ine&s;s has decrea&s;ed. As the capital of a private man, though acquired by a particular trade, may increa&s;e beyond what he can employ in it, and yet that trade continue to increa&s;e too; &s;o may likewi&s;e the capital of a great nation.</P>
<P>IN our North American and We&s;t Indian colonies, not only the wages of labour, but the intere&s;t of money, and con&s;equently the profits of &s;tock are higher than in England. In the different colonies both the legal and the market rate of intere&s;t run from &s;ix to eight per cent. High wages of labour and high profits of &s;tock, however, are things, perhaps, which &s;carce ever go together, except in the peculiar circum&s;tances of new colonies. A new colony mu&s;t always for &s;ome time be more under&s;tocked in proportion to the extent of its territory, and more underpeopled in proportion to the extent of its &s;tock, than the greater part of other countries. They have more land than they have &s;tock to cultivate. What they have, therefore, is applied to the cultivation only of what is mo&s;t fertile and mo&s;t favourably &s;ituated, the lands near the &s;ea &s;hore, and along the banks of navigable rivers. Such land too is frequently purcha&s;ed at a price below the value even of its natural
<PB N="114" REF="127">
produce. Stock employed in the purcha&s;e and improvement of &s;uch lands mu&s;t yield a very large profit, and con&s;equently afford to pay a very large intere&s;t. Its rapid accumulation in &s;o profitable an employment enables the planter to increa&s;e the number of his hands fa&s;ter than he can find them in a new &s;ettlement. Tho&s;e whom he can find, therefore, are very liberally rewarded. As the colony increa&s;es, the profits of &s;tock gradually dimini&s;h. When the mo&s;t fertile and be&s;t &s;ituated lands have been all occupied, le&s;s profit can be made by the cultivation of what is inferior both in &s;oil and &s;ituation, and le&s;s intere&s;t can be afforded for the &s;tock which is &s;o employed. In the greater part of our colonies, accordingly, both the legal and the market rate of intere&s;t have been con&s;ider|ably reduced during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century. As riches, improvement, and population have increa&s;ed, intere&s;t has declined. The wages of labour do not &s;ink with the profits of &s;tock. The demand for labour increa&s;es with the increa&s;e of &s;tock whatever be its profits; and after the&s;e are dimini&s;hed, &s;tock may not only continue to increa&s;e, but to increa&s;e much fa&s;ter than before. It is with indu&s;trious nations who are advancing in the acqui&s;ition of riches, as with indu&s;trious individuals. A great &s;tock, though with &s;mall profits, generally increa&s;es fa&s;ter than a &s;mall &s;tock with great profits. Money, &s;ays the proverb, makes money. When you have got a little, it is often ea&s;y to get more. The great diffi|culty is to get that little. The connection between the increa&s;e of &s;tock and that of indu&s;try, or of the demand for u&s;eful labour, has partly been explained already, but will be explained more fully hereafter in treating of the accumulation of &s;tock.</P>
<P>THE acqui&s;ition of new territory, or of new branches of trade, may &s;ometimes rai&s;e the profits of &s;tock, and with them the in|tere&s;t of money, even in a country which is fa&s;t advancing in the acqui&s;ition of riches. The &s;tock of the country not being &s;ufficient
<PB N="115" REF="128">
for the whole acce&s;&s;ion of bu&s;ine&s;s, which &s;uch acqui&s;itions pre&s;ent to the different people among whom it is divided, is applied to tho&s;e particular branches only which afford the greate&s;t profit. Part of what had before been employed in other trades, is nece&s;&s;a|rily withdrawn from them, and turned into &s;ome of the new and more profitable ones. In all tho&s;e old trades, therefore, the com|petition comes to be le&s;s than before. The market comes to be le&s;s fully &s;upplied with many different &s;orts of goods. Their price nece&s;&s;arily ri&s;es more or le&s;s, and yields a greater profit to tho&s;e who deal in them, who can, therefore, afford to borrow at a higher intere&s;t. For &s;ome time after the conclu&s;ion of the late war, not only private people of the be&s;t credit, but &s;ome of the greate&s;t com|panies in London, commonly borrowed at five per cent. who before that had not been u&s;ed to pay more than four, and four and a half per cent. The great acce&s;&s;ion both of territory and trade, by our acqui&s;itions in North America and the We&s;t Indies, will &s;uf|ficiently account for this, without &s;uppo&s;ing any diminution in the capital &s;tock of the &s;ociety. So great an acce&s;&s;ion of new bu&s;ine&s;s to be carried on by the old &s;tock, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have dimini&s;hed the quantity employed in a great number of particular branches, in which the competition being le&s;s, the profits mu&s;t have been greater. I &s;hall hereafter have occa&s;ion to mention the rea&s;ons which di&s;po&s;e me to believe that the capital &s;tock of Great Britain was not dimini&s;hed even by the enormous expence of the late war.</P>
<P>THE diminution of the capital &s;tock of the &s;ociety, or of the funds de&s;tined for the maintenance of indu&s;try, however, as it lowers the wages of labour, &s;o it rai&s;es the profits of &s;tock, and con&s;equently the intere&s;t of money. By the wages of labour being lowered, the owners of what &s;tock remains in the &s;ociety can bring their goods cheaper to market than before, and le&s;s &s;tock
<PB N="116" REF="129">
being employed in &s;upplying the market than before, they can &s;ell them dearer. Their goods co&s;t them le&s;s, and they get more for them. Their profits, therefore, being augmented at both ends, can well afford a large intere&s;t. The great fortunes &s;o &s;uddenly and &s;o ea&s;ily acquired in Bengal and the other Briti&s;h &s;ettlements in the Ea&s;t Indies, may &s;atisfy us that as the wages of labour are very low, &s;o the profits of &s;tock are very high in tho&s;e ruined countries. The intere&s;t of money is proportionably &s;o. In Bengal, money is frequently lent to the farmers at forty, fifty, and &s;ixty per cent. and the &s;ucceeding crop is mortgaged for the payment. As the profits which can afford &s;uch an intere&s;t mu&s;t eat up almo&s;t the whole rent of the landlord, &s;o &s;uch enormous u&s;ury mu&s;t in its turn eat up the greater part of tho&s;e profits. Before the fall of the Roman republick, a u&s;ury of the &s;ame kind &s;eems to have been common in the provinces, under the ruinous admini&s;tration of their procon&s;uls. The virtuous Brutus lent money in Cyprus at five and forty per cent. as we learn from the letters of Cicero.</P>
<P>IN a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the nature of its &s;oil and climate and its &s;ituation with re&s;pect to other countries allowed it to acquire; which could, therefore, advance no further, and which was not going back|wards, both the wages of labour and the profits of &s;tock would probably be very low. In a country fully peopled in proportion to what either its territory could maintain or its &s;tock employ, the competition for employment would nece&s;&s;arily be &s;o great as to reduce the wages of labour to what was barely &s;ufficient to keep up the number of labourers, and, the country being already fully peopled, that number could never be augmented. In a country fully &s;tocked in proportion to all the bu&s;ine&s;s it had to tran&s;act, as great a quantity of &s;tock would be employed in every particular branch as the nature and extent of the trade would admit. The
<PB N="117" REF="130">
competition, therefore, would everywhere be as great, and con|&s;equently the ordinary profit as low as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps no country has ever yet arrived at this degree of opulence. China &s;eems to have been long &s;tationary, and had probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches which is con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of its laws and in&s;titutions. But this complement may be much inferior to what, with other laws and in&s;titutions, the nature of its &s;oil, climate, and &s;ituation might admit of. A country which neglects or de&s;pi&s;es foreign commerce, and which admits the ve&s;&s;els of foreign nations into one or two of its ports only, cannot tran&s;act the &s;ame quantity of bu&s;ine&s;s which it might do with different laws and in&s;titutions. In a country too, where, though the rich or the owners of large capitals enjoy a good deal of &s;ecurity, the poor or the owners of &s;mall capitals enjoy &s;carce any, but are liable, under the pretence of ju&s;tice, to be pillaged and plundered at any time by the inferior mandarines, the quantity of &s;tock employed in all the different branches of bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;acted within it, can never be equal to what the nature and extent of that bu&s;ine&s;s might admit. In every different branch, the oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h the monopoly of the rich, who, by engro&s;&s;ing the whole trade to them|&s;elves, will be able to make very large profits. Twelve per cent. accordingly is &s;aid to be the common intere&s;t of money in China, and the ordinary profits of &s;tock mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to afford this large intere&s;t.</P>
<P>A DEFECT in the law may &s;ometimes rai&s;e the rate of intere&s;t con&s;iderably above what the condition of the country, as to wealth or poverty, would require. When the law does not enforce the performance of contracts, it puts all borrowers nearly upon the &s;ame footing with bankrupts or people of doubtful credit in

better regulated countries. The uncertainty of recovering his money makes the lender exact the &s;ame u&s;urious intere&s;t which is u&s;ually required from bankrupts. Among the barbarous nations who over|run the we&s;tern provinces of the Roman empire, the performance of contracts was left for many ages to the faith of the contracting parties. The courts of ju&s;tice of their kings &s;eldom intermeddled in it. The high rate of intere&s;t which took place in tho&s;e antient times may perhaps be partly accounted for from this cau&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN the law prohibits intere&s;t altogether, it does not prevent it. Many people mu&s;t borrow, and nobody will lend without &s;uch a con&s;ideration for the u&s;e of their money as is &s;uitable, not only to what can be made by the u&s;e of it, but to the difficulty and danger of evading the law. The high rate of intere&s;t among all Mahometan nations is accounted for by Mr. Monte&s;quieu, not from their poverty, but partly from this, and partly from the dif|ficulty of recovering the money.</P>
<P>THE lowe&s;t ordinary rate of profit mu&s;t always be &s;omething more than what is &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate the occa&s;ional lo&s;&s;es to which every employment of &s;tock is expo&s;ed. It is this &s;urplus only which is neat or clear profit. What is called gro&s;s pro|fit comprehends frequently, not only this &s;urplus, but what is retained for compen&s;ating &s;uch extraordinary lo&s;&s;es. The intere&s;t which the borrower can afford to pay is in proportion to the clear profit only.</P>
<P>THE lowe&s;t ordinary rate of intere&s;t mu&s;t, in the &s;ame manner, be &s;omething more than &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate the occa&s;ional lo&s;&s;es to which lending, even with tolerable prudence, is expo&s;ed. Were it not more, charity or friend&s;hip could be the only motives for lending.</P>

IN a country which had acquired its full complement of riches, where in every particular branch of bu&s;ine&s;s there was the greate&s;t quantity of &s;tock that could be employed in it, as the ordinary rate of clear profit would be very &s;mall, &s;o the u&s;ual market rate of intere&s;t which could be afforded out of it, would be &s;o low as to render it impo&s;&s;ible for any but the very wealthie&s;t people to live upon the intere&s;t of their money. All people of &s;mall or middling fortunes would be obliged to &s;uperintend them&s;elves the employment of their own &s;tocks. It would be nece&s;&s;ary that almo&s;t every man &s;hould be a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, or engage in &s;ome &s;ort of trade. The province of Holland &s;eems to be approach|ing near to this &s;tate. It is there unfa&s;hionable not to be a man of bu&s;ine&s;s. Nece&s;&s;ity makes it u&s;ual for almo&s;t every man to be &s;o, and cu&s;tom every where regulates fa&s;hion. As it is ridiculous not to dre&s;s, &s;o is it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, not to be employed, like other people. As a man of a civil profe&s;&s;ion &s;eems aukward in a camp or a garri&s;on, and is even in &s;ome danger of being de&s;pi&s;ed there, &s;o does an idle man among men of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE highe&s;t ordinary rate of profit may be &s;uch as, in the price of the greater part of commodities, eats up the whole of what &s;hould go to the rent of the land, and leaves only what is &s;uffi|cient to pay the labour of preparing and bringing them to market, according to the lowe&s;t rate at which labour can any where be paid, the bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the labourer. The workman mu&s;t always have been fed in &s;ome way or other while he was about the work; but the landlord may not always have been paid. The profits of the trade which the &s;ervants of the Ea&s;t India Com|pany carry on in Bengal may not perhaps be very far from this rate.</P>
<P>THE proportion which the u&s;ual market rate of intere&s;t ought to bear to the ordinary rate of clear profit, nece&s;&s;arily varies as
<PB N="120" REF="133">
profit ri&s;es or falls. Double intere&s;t is in Great Britain reckoned, what the merchants call, a good, moderate, rea&s;onable profit; terms which I apprehend mean no more than a common and u&s;ual profit. In a country where the ordinary rate of clear profit is eight or ten per cent. it may be rea&s;onable that one half of it &s;hould go to intere&s;t wherever bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on with borrowed money. The &s;tock is at the ri&s;k of the borrower, who, as it were, in&s;ures it to the lender; and four or five per cent. may in the greater part of trades, be both a &s;ufficient profit upon the ri&s;k of this in&s;urance, and a &s;ufficient recompence for the trouble of employing the &s;tock. But the proportion between intere&s;t and clear profit might not be the &s;ame in countries where the ordinary rate of profit was either a good deal lower, or a good deal higher. If it were a good deal lower, one half of it perhaps could not be afforded for intere&s;t; and more might be afforded if it were a good deal higher.</P>
<P>IN countries which are fa&s;t advancing to riches, the low rate of profit may, in the price of many commodities, compen&s;ate the high wages of labour, and enable tho&s;e countries to &s;ell as cheap as their le&s;s thriving neighbours, among whom the wages of labour may be lower.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Of Wages and Profit in the different Employments of Labour and Stock.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE whole of the advantages and di&s;advantages of the dif|ferent employments of labour and &s;tock mu&s;t, in the &s;ame neighbourhood, be either perfectly equal or continually tending to equality. If in the &s;ame neighbourhood, there was any employment either evidently more or le&s;s advantageous than the re&s;t, &s;o many people would crowd into it in the one ca&s;e, and &s;o many would de&s;ert it in the other, that its advantages would &s;oon return to the level of other employments. This at lea&s;t would be the ca&s;e in a &s;ociety where things were left to follow their natural cour&s;e, where there was perfect liberty, and where every man was perfectly free both to chu&s;e what occupation he thought proper, and to change it as often as he thought proper. Every man's intere&s;t would prompt him to &s;eek the advantageous and to &s;hun the di&s;advantageous employment.</P>
<P>PECUNIARY wages and profit, indeed, are every where in Eu|rope extreamly different according to the different employments of labour and &s;tock. But this difference ari&s;es partly from certain circum&s;tances in the employments them&s;elves, which, either really, or at lea&s;t in the imaginations of men, make up for a &s;mall pecuniary gain in &s;ome, and counter-balance a great one in others; and partly from the policy of Europe, which nowhere leaves things at perfect liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="135">
THE particular con&s;ideration of tho&s;e circum&s;tances and of that policy will divide this chapter into two parts.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I. <HI>Inequalities ari&s;ing from the Nature of the Employments them&s;elves.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE five following are the principal circum&s;tances which, &s;o+far as I have been able to ob&s;erve, make up for a &s;mall pecuniary gain in &s;ome employments, and counter-balance a great one in others: fir&s;t, the agreeablene&s;s or di&s;agreeablene&s;s of the employments them&s;elves; &s;econdly, the ea&s;ine&s;s and cheapne&s;s, or the difficulty and expence of learning them; thirdly, the con&s;tancy or incon&s;tancy of employment in them; fourthly, the &s;mall or great tru&s;t which mu&s;t be repo&s;ed in tho&s;e who exerci&s;e them; and, fifthly, the probability or improbability of &s;ucce&s;s in them.</P>
<P>FIRST, The wages of labour vary with the ea&s;e or hard&s;hip, the cleanline&s;s or dirtine&s;s, the honourablene&s;s or di&s;honour|ablene&s;s of the employment. Thus in mo&s;t places, take the year round, a journeyman taylor earns le&s;s than a journeyman weaver. His work is much ea&s;ier. A journeyman weaver earns le&s;s than a journeyman &s;mith. His work is not always ea&s;ier, but it is much cleanlier. A journeyman black&s;mith, though an artificer, &s;eldom earns &s;o much in twelve hours as a collier, who is only a labourer, does in eight. His work is not quite &s;o dirty, is le&s;s dangerous, and is carried on in day-light, and above ground. Honour makes a great part of the reward of all honourable pro|fe&s;&s;ions. In point of pecuniary gain, all things con&s;idered, they are generally under-recompen&s;ed, as I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how by and by. Di&s;grace has the contrary effect. The trade of a
<PB N="123" REF="136">
butcher is a brutal and an odious bu&s;ine&s;s; but it is in mo&s;t places more profitable than the greater part of common trades. The mo&s;t dete&s;table of all employments, that of public executioner, is, in proportion to the quantity of work done, better paid than any common trade whatever.</P>
<P>HUNTING and fi&s;hing, the mo&s;t important employments of mankind in the rude &s;tate of &s;ociety, become in its advanced &s;tate their mo&s;t agreeable amu&s;ements, and they pur&s;ue for plea&s;ure what they once followed from nece&s;&s;ity. In the advanced &s;tate of &s;ociety, therefore, they are all very poor people who follow as a trade, what other people pur&s;ue as a pa&s;time. Fi&s;hermen have been &s;o &s;ince the time of Theocritus. A poacher is every where a very poor man in Great Britain. In countries where the rigour of the law &s;uffers no poachers, the licen&s;ed hunter is not in a much better condition. The natural ta&s;te for tho&s;e employ|ments makes more people follow them than can live comfortably by them, and the produce of their labour, in proportion to its quantity, comes always too cheap to market to afford any thing but the mo&s;t &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the labourers.</P>
<P>DISAGREEABLENESS and di&s;grace affect the profits of &s;tock in the &s;ame manner as the wages of labour. The keeper of an inn or tavern, who is never ma&s;ter of his own hou&s;e, and who is expo&s;ed to the brutality of every drunkard, exerci&s;es neither a very agreeable nor a very creditable bu&s;ine&s;s. But there is &s;carce any common trade in which a &s;mall &s;tock yields &s;o great a profit.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, The wages of labour vary with the ea&s;ine&s;s and cheapne&s;s or the difficulty and expence of learning the bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="137">
WHEN any expen&s;ive machine is erected, the extraordinary work to be performed by it, before it is worn out, it mu&s;t be ex|pected, will replace the capital laid out upon it, with at lea&s;t its ordinary profits. A man educated at the expence of much labour and time to any of tho&s;e employments which require extraordinary dexterity and &s;kill, may be compared to one of tho&s;e expen&s;ive machines. The work which he learns to perform, it mu&s;t be expected, over and above the u&s;ual wages of common labour, will replace to him the whole expence of his education, with at lea&s;t the ordinary profits of an equally valuable capital. It mu&s;t do this too in a rea&s;onable time, regard being had to the very uncertain du|ration of human life, in the &s;ame manner as to the more certain duration of the machine.</P>
<P>THE difference between the wages of &s;killed labour and tho&s;e of common labour, is founded upon this principle.</P>
<P>THE policy of Europe con&s;iders the labour of all mechanicks, artificers, and manufacturers, as &s;killed labour; and that of all country labourers as common labour. It &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e that of the former to be of a more nice and delicate nature than that of the latter. It is &s;o perhaps in &s;ome ca&s;es; but in the greater part it is quite otherwi&s;e, as I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew by and by. The laws and cu&s;toms of Europe, therefore, in order to qualify any per&s;on for exerci&s;ing the one &s;pecies of labour, impo&s;e the nece&s;|&s;ity of an apprentice&s;hip, though with different degrees of rigour in different places. They leave the other free and open to every body. During the continuance of the apprentice&s;hip, the whole labour of the apprentice belongs to his ma&s;ter. In the mean time he mu&s;t, in many ca&s;es, be maintained by his parents or relations, and in almo&s;t all ca&s;es mu&s;t be cloathed by them. Some money too is commonly given to the ma&s;ter for teaching him his trade. They
<PB N="125" REF="138">
who cannot give money, give time, or become bound for more than the u&s;ual number of years; a con&s;ideration which, though it is not always advantageous to the ma&s;ter, on account of the u&s;ual idlene&s;s of apprentices, is always di&s;advantageous to the apprentice. In country labour, on the contrary, the labourer, while he is em|ployed about the ea&s;ier, learns the more difficult parts of his bu&s;ine&s;s, and his own labour maintains him through all the different &s;tages of his employment. It is rea&s;onable, therefore, that in Europe the wages of mechanicks, artificers, and manufacturers, &s;hould be &s;omewhat higher than tho&s;e of common labourers. They are &s;o accordingly, and their &s;uperior gains make them in mo&s;t places be con&s;idered as a &s;uperior rank of people. This &s;uperiority, however, is generally very &s;mall; the daily or weekly earnings of journeymen in the more common &s;orts of manufactures, &s;uch as tho&s;e of plain linen and woollen cloth, computed at an average, are, in mo&s;t places, very little more than the day wages of common labourers. Their employment, indeed, is more &s;teady and uniform, and the &s;uperiority of their earnings, taking the whole year together, may be &s;omewhat greater. It &s;eems evidently, however, to be no greater than what is &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate the &s;uperior expence of their education.</P>
<P>EDUCATION in the ingenious arts and in the liberal profe&s;|&s;ions, is &s;till more tedious and expen&s;ive. The pecuniary re|compence, therefore, of painters and &s;culptors, of lawyers and phy&s;icians, ought to be much more liberal, and it is &s;o accord|ingly.</P>
<P>THE profits of &s;tock &s;eem to be very little affected by the ea&s;i|ne&s;s or difficulty of learning the trade in which it is employed. All the different ways in which &s;tock is commonly employed in great towns &s;eem, in reality, to be almo&s;t equally ea&s;y and
<PB N="126" REF="139">
equally difficult to learn. One branch either of foreign or dome&s;|tick trade, cannot well be a much more intricate bu&s;ine&s;s than another.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, The wages of labour in different occupations vary with the con&s;tancy or incon&s;tancy of employment.</P>
<P>EMPLOYMENT is much more con&s;tant in &s;ome trades than in others. In the greater part of manufactures, a journeyman may be pretty &s;ure of employment almo&s;t every day in the year that he is able to work. A ma&s;on or bricklayer, on the contrary, can work neither in hard fro&s;t nor in foul weather, and his employ|ment at all other times depends upon the occa&s;ional calls of his cu|&s;tomers. He is liable, in con&s;equence, to be frequently without any. What he earns, therefore, while he is employed, mu&s;t not only maintain him while he is idle, but make him &s;ome compen&s;ation for tho&s;e anxious and de&s;ponding moments which the thought of &s;o precarious a &s;ituation mu&s;t &s;ometimes occa&s;ion. Where the computed earnings of the greater part of manufacturers, accord|ingly, are nearly upon a level with the day wages of common la|bourers, tho&s;e of ma&s;ons and bricklayers are generally from one|half more to double tho&s;e wages. Where common labourers earn four and five &s;hillings a week, ma&s;ons and bricklayers frequently earn &s;even and eight; where the former earn &s;ix, the latter often earn nine and ten; and where the former earn nine and ten, as in London, the latter commonly earn fifteen and eighteen. No &s;pecies of &s;killed labour, however, &s;eems more ea&s;y to learn than that of ma&s;ons and bricklayers. Chairmen in London, during the &s;um|mer &s;ea&s;on, are &s;aid &s;ometimes to be employed as bricklayers. The high wages of tho&s;e workmen, therefore, are not &s;o much the recompence of their &s;kill, as the compen&s;ation for the incon&s;tancy of their employment.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="140">
A HOUSE carpenter &s;eems to exerci&s;e rather a nicer and more ingenious trade than a ma&s;on. In mo&s;t places, however, for it is not univer&s;ally &s;o, his day-wages are &s;omewhat lower. His employment, though it depends much, does not depend &s;o en|tirely upon the occa&s;ional calls of his cu&s;tomers; and it is not liable to be interrupted by the weather.</P>
<P>WHEN the trades which generally afford con&s;tant employment, happen in a particular place not to do &s;o, the wages of the work|men always ri&s;e a good deal above their ordinary proportion to tho&s;e of common labour. In London almo&s;t all journeymen ar|tificers are liable to be called upon and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by their ma&s;ters from day to day, and from week to week, in the &s;ame manner as day-labourers in other places. The lowe&s;t order of artificers, journeymen taylors, accordingly earn there half a crown a-day, though eighteen-pence may be reckoned the wages of common labour. In &s;mall towns and country villages, the wages of journeymen taylors frequently &s;carce equal tho&s;e of common labour; but in London they are often many weeks without employment, particularly during the &s;ummer.</P>
<P>WHEN the incon&s;tancy of employment is combined with the hard&s;hip, di&s;agreeablene&s;s and dirtine&s;s of the work, it &s;ometimes rai&s;es the wages of the mo&s;t common labour above tho&s;e of the mo&s;t &s;kilful artificers. A collier working by the piece is &s;uppo&s;ed, at Newca&s;tle, to earn commonly about double, and in many parts of Scotland about three times the wages of common labour. His high wages ari&s;e altogether from the hard&s;hip, di&s;agreeablene&s;s, and dirtine&s;s of his work. His employment may, upon mo&s;t oc|ca&s;ions, be as con&s;tant as he plea&s;es. The coal-heavers in Lon|don exerci&s;e a trade which in hard&s;hip, dirtine&s;s, and di&s;agreeable|ne&s;s, almo&s;t equals that of colliers; and from the unavoidable
<PB N="128" REF="141">
irregularity in the arrivals of coal &s;hips, the employment of the greater part of them is nece&s;&s;arily very incon&s;tant. If colliers, therefore, commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labour, it ought not to &s;eem unrea&s;onable that coal-heavers &s;hould &s;ometimes earn four and five times tho&s;e wages. In the enquiry made into their condition a few years ago, it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid, they could earn from &s;ix to ten &s;hillings a-day. Six &s;hillings are about four times the wages of common labour in London, and in every particular trade, the lowe&s;t common earnings may always be con&s;idered as tho&s;e of the far greater number. How extravagant &s;oever tho&s;e earnings may appear, if they were more than &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate all the di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances of the bu&s;ine&s;s, there would &s;oon be &s;o great a number of competitors as, in a trade which has no exclu&s;ive privilege, would quickly reduce them to a lower rate.</P>
<P>THE con&s;tancy or incon&s;tancy of employment cannot affect the ordinary profits of &s;tock in any particular trade. Whether the &s;tock is or is not con&s;tantly employed depends, not upon the trade, but the trader.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, The wages of labour vary according to the &s;mall or great tru&s;t which mu&s;t be repo&s;ed in the workmen.</P>
<P>THE wages of gold&s;miths and jewellers are every where &s;uperior to tho&s;e of many other workmen, not only of equal, but of much &s;uperior ingenuity; on account of the precious materials with which they are intru&s;ted.</P>
<P>WE tru&s;t our health to the phy&s;ician; our fortune and &s;ome|times our life and reputation to the lawyer and attorney. Such
<PB N="129" REF="142">
confidence could not &s;afely be repo&s;ed in people of a very mean or low condition. Their reward mu&s;t be &s;uch, therefore, as may give them that rank in the &s;ociety which &s;o important a tru&s;t re|quires. The long time and the great expence which mu&s;t be laid out in their education, when combined with this cir|cum&s;tance, nece&s;&s;arily enhance &s;till further the price of their la|bour.</P>
<P>WHEN a per&s;on employs only his own &s;tock in trade, there is no tru&s;t; and the credit which he may get from other people, depends, not upon the nature of his trade, but upon their opi|nion of his fortune, probity, and prudence. The different rates of profit, therefore, in the different branches of trade, cannot ari&s;e from the different degrees of tru&s;t repo&s;ed in the traders.</P>
<P>FIFTHLY, The wages of labour in different employments vary according to the probability or improbability of &s;ucce&s;s in them.</P>
<P>THE probability that any particular per&s;on &s;hall ever be qualified for the employment to which he is educated, is very different in different occupations. In the greater part of mechanick trades, &s;ucce&s;s is almo&s;t certain; but very uncertain in the liberal profe&s;|&s;ions. Put your &s;on apprentice to a &s;hoemaker, there is little doubt of his learning to make a pair of &s;hoes: But &s;end him to &s;tudy the law, it is at lea&s;t twenty to one if ever he makes &s;uch proficiency as will enable him to live by the bu&s;ine&s;s. In a per|fectly fair lottery, tho&s;e who draw the prizes ought to gain all that is lo&s;t by tho&s;e who draw the blanks. In a profe&s;&s;ion where twenty fail for one that &s;ucceeds, that one ought to gain all that &s;hould have been gained by the un&s;ucce&s;sful twenty. The
<PB N="130" REF="143">
coun&s;ellor at law who, perhaps, at near forty years of age, begins to make &s;omething by his profe&s;&s;ion, ought to receive the retribu|tion, not only of his own &s;o tedious and expen&s;ive education, but of that of more than twenty others who are never likely to make any thing by it. How extravagant &s;oever the fees of coun&s;ellors at law may &s;ometimes appear, their real retribution is never equal to this. Compute in any particular place, what is likely to be annually gained, and what is likely to be annually &s;pent, by all the different workmen in any common trade, &s;uch as that of &s;hoemakers or weavers, and you will find that the former &s;um will generally exceed the latter. But make the &s;ame computation with regard to all the coun&s;ellors and &s;tudents of law, in all the different inns of court, and you will find that their annual gains bear but a very &s;mall proportion to their annual expence, even though you rate the former as high, and the latter as low, as can well be done. The lottery of the law, therefore, is very far from being a perfectly fair lottery; and that, as well as many other liberal and honourable profe&s;&s;ions, are, in point of pecuniary gain, evidently under-recompenced.</P>
<P>THOSE profe&s;&s;ions keep their level, however, with other occu|pations, and, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;couragements, all the mo&s;t generous and liberal &s;pirits are eager to crowd into them. Two different cau&s;es contribute to recommend them. Fir&s;t, the de&s;ire of the reputation which attends upon &s;uperior excellence in any of them; and, &s;econdly, the natural confidence which every man has more or le&s;s, not only in his own abilities, but in his own good fortune.</P>
<P>TO excel in any profe&s;&s;ion, in which but few arrive at medio|crity, is the mo&s;t deci&s;ive mark of what is called genius or &s;uperior talents. The publick admiration which attends upon &s;uch di&s;|tingui&s;hed
<PB N="131" REF="144">
abilities, makes always a part of their reward; a greater or &s;maller in proportion as it is higher or lower in degree. It makes a con&s;iderable part of it in the profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ick; a &s;till greater perhaps in that of law; in poetry and philo&s;ophy it makes almo&s;t the whole.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome very agreeable and beautiful talents of which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion commands a certain &s;ort of admiration; but of which the exerci&s;e for the &s;ake of gain is con&s;idered, whether from rea&s;on or prejudice, as a &s;ort of publick pro&s;titution. The pecuniary re|compence, therefore, of tho&s;e who exerci&s;e them in this manner, mu&s;t be &s;ufficient, not only to pay for the time, labour, and expence of acquiring the talents, but for the di&s;credit which attends the employment of them as the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The exor|bitant rewards of players, opera-&s;ingers, opera-dancers, &amp;c. are founded upon tho&s;e two principles; the rarity and beauty of the talents, and the di&s;credit of employing them in this manner. It &s;eems ab&s;urd at fir&s;t &s;ight that we &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e their per&s;ons, and yet reward their talents with the mo&s;t profu&s;e liberality. While we do the one, however, we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity do the other. Should the publick opinion or prejudice ever alter with regard to &s;uch occupations, their pecuniary recompence would quickly dimini&s;h. More people would apply to them, and the competition would quickly reduce the price of their labour. Such talents, though far from being common, are by no means &s;o rare as is imagined. Many people po&s;&s;e&s;s them in great perfection, who di&s;|dain to make this u&s;e of them; and many more are capable of acquiring them, if any thing could be made honourably by them.</P>
<P>THE over-weening conceit which the greater part of men have of their own abilities, is an antient evil remarked by the philo&s;o|phers and morali&s;ts of all ages. Their ab&s;urd pre&s;umption in
<PB N="132" REF="145">
their own good fortune, has been le&s;s taken notice of. It is, how|ever, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more univer&s;al. There is no man living who, when in tolerable health and &s;pirits, has not &s;ome &s;hare of it. The chance of gain is by every man more or le&s;s over-valued, and the chance of lo&s;s is by mo&s;t men under-valued, and by &s;carce any man, who is in tolerable health and &s;pirits, valued more than it is worth.</P>
<P>THAT the chance of gain is naturally overvalued, we may learn from the univer&s;al &s;ucce&s;s of lotteries. The world neither ever &s;aw, nor ever will &s;ee, a perfectly fair lottery; or one in which the whole gain compen&s;ated the whole lo&s;s; becau&s;e the undertaker could make nothing by it. In the &s;tate lotteries the tickets are really not worth the price which is paid by the original &s;ub&s;cribers, and yet commonly &s;ell in the market for twenty, thirty, and &s;ometimes forty per cent. advance. The vain hope of gaining &s;ome of the great prizes is the &s;ole cau&s;e of this demand. The &s;obere&s;t people &s;carce look upon it as a folly to pay a &s;mall &s;um for the chance of gaining ten or twenty thou&s;and pounds; though they know that even that &s;mall &s;um is perhaps twenty or thirty per cent. more than the chance is worth. In a lottery in which no prize exceeded twenty pounds, though in other re&s;pects it approached much nearer to a perfectly fair one than the common &s;tate lot|teries, there would not be the &s;ame demand for tickets. In order to have a better chance for &s;ome of the great prizes, &s;ome people purcha&s;e &s;everal tickets, and others, &s;mall &s;hares in a &s;till greater number. There is not, however, a more certain propo&s;ition in mathematicks than that the more tickets you adventure upon, the more likely you are to be a lo&s;er. Adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery, and you lo&s;e for certain; and the greater the number of your tickets the nearer you approach to this certainty.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="146">
THAT the chance of lo&s;s is frequently undervalued, and &s;carce ever valued more than it is worth, we may learn from the very moderate profit of in&s;urers. In order to make in&s;urance, either from fire or &s;ea ri&s;k, a trade at all, the common premium mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate the common lo&s;&s;es, to pay the expence of management, and to afford &s;uch a profit as might have been drawn from an equal capital employed in any common trade. The per&s;on who pays no more than this, evidently pays no more than the real value of the ri&s;k, or the lowe&s;t price at which he can rea&s;onably expect to in&s;ure it. But though many people have made a little money by in&s;urance, very few have made a great fortune; and from this con&s;i|deration alone it &s;eems evident enough that the ordinary balance of profit and lo&s;s is not more advantageous in this than in other com|mon trades by which &s;o many people make fortunes. Moderate, however, as the premium of in&s;urance commonly is, many people de&s;pi&s;e the ri&s;k too much to care to pay it. Taking the whole kingdom at an average, nineteen hou&s;es in twenty, or rather per|haps ninety-nine in a hundred, are not in&s;ured from fire. Sea ri&s;k is more alarming to the greater part of people, and the pro|portion of &s;hips in&s;ured to tho&s;e not in&s;ured is much greater. Many &s;ail, however, at all &s;ea&s;ons and even in time of war, with|out any in&s;urance. This may &s;ometimes, perhaps, be done without any imprudence. When a great company, or even a great mer|chant, has twenty or thirty &s;hips at &s;ea, they may, as it were, in&s;ure one another. The premium &s;aved upon them all, may more than compen&s;ate &s;uch lo&s;&s;es as they are likely to meet with in the common cour&s;e of chances. The neglect of in&s;urance upon &s;hipping, however, in the &s;ame manner as upon hou&s;es, is, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, the effect of no &s;uch nice calculation, but of mere thoughtle&s;s ra&s;hne&s;s and pre&s;umptuous contempt of the ri&s;k.</P>
<P>THE contempt of ri&s;k and the pre&s;umptuous hope of &s;ucce&s;s, are in no period of life more active than at the age at which young
<PB N="134" REF="147">
people chu&s;e their profe&s;&s;ions. How little the fear of misfortune is then capable of balancing the hope of good luck, appears &s;till more evidently in the readine&s;s of the common people to enli&s;t as &s;oldiers or to go to &s;ea, than in the eagerne&s;s of tho&s;e of better fa&s;hion to enter into what are called the liberal profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>WHAT a common &s;oldier may lo&s;e is obvious enough. With|out regarding the danger, however, young volunteers never enli&s;t &s;o readily as at the beginning of a new war; and though they have &s;carce any chance of preferment, they figure to them&s;elves in their youthful fancies a thou&s;and occa&s;ions of acquiring honour and di&s;tinction which never occur. The&s;e romantick hopes make the whole price of their blood. Their pay is le&s;s than that of common labourers, and in actual &s;ervice their fatigues are much greater.</P>
<P>THE lottery of the &s;ea is not altogether &s;o di&s;advantageous as that of the army. The &s;on of a creditable labourer or artificer may frequently go to &s;ea with his father's con&s;ent; but if he enli&s;ts as a &s;oldier, it is always without it. Other people &s;ee &s;ome chance of his making &s;omething by the one trade: Nobody but him&s;elf &s;ees any of his making any thing by the other. The great admiral is le&s;s the object of publick admiration than the great general, and the highe&s;t &s;ucce&s;s in the &s;ea &s;ervice promi&s;es a le&s;s brilliant fortune and reputation than equal &s;ucce&s;s in the land. The &s;ame difference runs through all the inferior degrees of prefer|ment in both. By the rules of precedency a captain in the navy ranks with a colonel in the army: but he does not rank with him in the common e&s;timation. As the great prizes in the lottery are le&s;s, the &s;maller ones mu&s;t be more numerous. Common &s;ailors, therefore, more frequently get &s;ome fortune and preferment than common &s;oldiers; and the hope of tho&s;e prizes is what principally recommends the trade. Though their &s;kill and dexterity are much
<PB N="135" REF="148">
&s;uperior to that of almo&s;t any artificers, and though their whole life is one continual &s;cene of hard&s;hip and danger, yet for all this dexterity and &s;kill, for all tho&s;e hard&s;hips and dangers, while they remain in the condition of common &s;ailors, they receive &s;carce any other recompence but the plea&s;ure of exerci&s;ing the one and of &s;urmounting the other. Their wages are not greater than tho&s;e of common labourers at the port which regulates the rate of &s;ea|mens wages. As they are continually going from port to port, the monthly pay of tho&s;e who &s;ail from all the different ports of Great Britain, is more nearly upon a level than that of any other workmen in tho&s;e different places; and the rate of the port to and from which the greate&s;t number &s;ail, that is the port of London, regulates that of all the re&s;t. At London the wages of the greater part of the different cla&s;&s;es of workmen are about double tho&s;e of the &s;ame cla&s;&s;es at Edinburgh. But the &s;ailors who &s;ail from the port of London &s;eldom earn above three or four &s;hillings a month more than tho&s;e who &s;ail from the port of Leith, and the difference is frequently not &s;o great. In time of peace, and in the merchant &s;ervice, the London price is from a guinea to about &s;even and twenty &s;hillings the calendar month. A common labourer in London, at the rate of nine or ten &s;hillings a week, may earn in the calendar month from forty to five and forty &s;hillings. The &s;ailor, indeed, over and above his pay, is &s;upplied with provi&s;ions. Their value, however, may not perhaps always exceed the diffe|rence between his pay and that of the common labourer; and though it &s;ometimes &s;hould, the exce&s;s will not be clear gain to the &s;ailor, becau&s;e he cannot &s;hare it with his wife and family, whom he mu&s;t maintain out of his wages at home.</P>
<P>THE dangers and hair-breadth e&s;capes of a life of adventures, in&s;tead of di&s;heartening young people, &s;eem frequently to recom|mend a trade to them. A tender mother, among the inferior
<PB N="136" REF="149">
ranks of people, is often afraid to &s;end her &s;on to &s;chool at a &s;ea|port town, le&s;t the &s;ight of the &s;hips and the conver&s;ation and adventures of the &s;ailors &s;hould entice him to go to &s;ea. The di&s;tant pro&s;pect of hazards, from which we can hope to extricate our&s;elves by courage and addre&s;s, is not di&s;agreeable to us, and does not rai&s;e the wages of labour in any employment. It is otherwi&s;e with tho&s;e in which courage and addre&s;s can be of no avail. In trades which are known to be very unwhole&s;ome, the wages of labour are always remarkably high. Unwhole&s;omene&s;s is a &s;pecies of di&s;agreeablene&s;s, and its effects upon the wages of labour are to be ranked under that general head.</P>
<P>IN all the different employments of &s;tock, the ordinary rate of profit varies more or le&s;s with the certainty or uncertainty of the returns. The&s;e are in general le&s;s uncertain in the inland than in the foreign trade, and in &s;ome branches of foreign trade than in others; in the trade to North America, for example, than in that to Jamaica. The ordinary rate of profit always ri&s;es more or le&s;s with the ri&s;k. It does not, however, &s;eem to ri&s;e in proportion to it, or &s;o as to compen&s;ate it compleatly. Bankruptcies are mo&s;t frequent in the mo&s;t hazardous trades. The mo&s;t hazardous of all trades, that of a &s;muggler, though when the adventure &s;ucceeds it is likewi&s;e the mo&s;t profitable, is the infallible road to bankruptcy. The pre&s;umptuous hope of &s;ucce&s;s &s;eems to act here as upon all other occa&s;ions, and to entice &s;o many adventurers into tho&s;e hazardous trades, that their competition reduces the profit below what is &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate the ri&s;k. To compen&s;ate it compleatly, the common returns ought, over and above the ordi|nary profits of &s;tock, not only to make up for all occa&s;ional lo&s;&s;es, but to afford a &s;urplus profit to the adventurers of the &s;ame nature with the profit of in&s;urers. But if the common returns were &s;uf|ficient
<PB N="137" REF="150">
for all this, bankruptcies would not be more frequent in the&s;e than in other trades.</P>
<P>OF the five circum&s;tances, therefore, which vary the wages of labour, two only affect the profits of &s;tock; the agreeablene&s;s or di&s;agreeablene&s;s of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and the ri&s;k or &s;ecurity with which it is attended. In point of agreeablene&s;s or di&s;agreeablene&s;s, there is little or no difference in the far greater part of the different employments of &s;tock; but a great deal in tho&s;e of labour; and the ordinary profit of &s;tock, though it ri&s;es with the ri&s;k, does not always &s;eem to ri&s;e in proportion to it. It &s;hould follow from all this, that, in the &s;ame &s;ociety or neighbourhood, the average and ordinary rates of profit in the different employments of &s;tock &s;hould be more nearly upon a level than the pecuniary wages of the different &s;orts of labour. They are &s;o accordingly. The dif|ference, between the earnings of a common labourer and tho&s;e of a well employed lawyer or phy&s;ician, is evidently much greater, than that, between the ordinary profits in any two different branches of trade. The apparent difference, be&s;ides, in the profits of different trades, is generally a deception ari&s;ing from our not always di&s;tingui&s;hing what ought to be con&s;idered as wages, from what ought to be con&s;idered as profit.</P>
<P>APOTHECARIES profit is become a bye-word, denoting &s;omething uncommonly extravagant. This great apparent profit, however, is frequently no more than the rea&s;onable wages of labour. The &s;kill of an apothecary is a much nicer and more delicate matter than that of any artificer whatever; and the tru&s;t which is repo&s;ed in him is of much greater importance. He is the phy&s;ician of the poor in all ca&s;es, and of the rich when the di&s;tre&s;s or danger is not very great. His reward, therefore, ought to be &s;uitable to his &s;kill and his tru&s;t, and it ari&s;es generally from the price at
<PB N="138" REF="151">
which he &s;ells his drugs. But the whole drugs which the be&s;t employed apothecary, in a large market town, will &s;ell in a year, may not perhaps co&s;t him above thirty or forty pounds. Though he &s;hould &s;ell them, therefore, for three or four hundred, or at a thou&s;and per cent. profit, this may frequently be no more than the rea&s;onable wages of his labour charged, in the only way in which he can charge them, upon the price of his drugs. The greater part of the apparent profit is real wages di&s;gui&s;ed in the garb of profit.</P>
<P>IN a &s;mall &s;ea-port town, a little grocer will make forty or fifty per cent. upon a &s;tock of a &s;ingle hundred pounds, while a con|&s;iderable whole&s;ale merchant in the &s;ame place will &s;carce make eight or ten per cent. upon a &s;tock of ten thou&s;and. The trade of the grocer may be nece&s;&s;ary for the conveniency of the inhabitants, and the narrowne&s;s of the market may not admit the employment of a larger capital in the bu&s;ine&s;s. The man, however, mu&s;t not only live by his trade, but live by it &s;uitably to the qualifications which it requires. Be&s;ides po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a little capital, he mu&s;t be able to read, write, and account, and mu&s;t be a tolerable judge too of, perhaps, fifty or &s;ixty different &s;orts of goods, their prices, qualities, and the markets where they are to be had cheape&s;t. He mu&s;t have all the knowledge, in &s;hort, that is nece&s;&s;ary for a great merchant, which nothing hinders him from becoming but the want of a &s;ufficient capital. Thirty or forty pounds a year cannot be con&s;idered as too great a recompence for the labour of a per&s;on &s;o accompli&s;hed. Deduct this from the &s;eemingly great profits of his capital, and little more will remain, perhaps, than the ordinary profits of &s;tock. The greater part of the apparent profit is, in this ca&s;e too, real wages.</P>
<P>THE difference between the apparent profit of the retail and that of the whole&s;ale trade, is much le&s;s in the capital than in
<PB N="139" REF="152">
&s;mall towns and country villages. Where ten thou&s;and pounds can be employed in the grocery trade, the wages of the grocer's labour make but a very trifling addition to the real profits of &s;o great a &s;tock. The apparent profits of the wealthy retailer, there|fore, are there more nearly upon a level with tho&s;e of the whole&s;ale merchant. It is upon this account that goods &s;old by retail are generally as cheap and frequently much cheaper in the capital than in &s;mall towns and country villages. Grocery goods, for example, are generally much cheaper; bread and butcher's-meat frequently as cheap. It co&s;ts no more to bring grocery goods to the great town than to the country village; but it co&s;ts a great deal more to bring corn and cattle, as the greater part of them mu&s;t be brought from a much greater di&s;tance. The prime co&s;t of grocery goods, therefore, being the &s;ame in both places, they are cheape&s;t where the lea&s;t profit is charged upon them. The prime co&s;t of bread and butcher's-meat is greater in the great town than in the country village; and though the profit is le&s;s, therefore, they are not always cheaper there, but often equally cheap. In &s;uch articles as bread and butcher's-meat, the &s;ame cau&s;e, which dimini&s;hes apparent profit, increa&s;es prime co&s;t. The extent of the market, by giving employment to greater &s;tocks, dimini&s;hes apparent profit; but by requiring &s;upplies from a greater di&s;tance, it increa&s;es prime co&s;t. This diminution of the one and increa&s;e of the other &s;eem, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, nearly to counter-balance one another; which is probably the rea&s;on that, though the prices of corn and cattle are commonly very different in different parts of the kingdom, tho&s;e of bread and butcher's-meat are generally very nearly the &s;ame through the greater part of it.</P>
<P>THOUGH the profits of &s;tock both in the whole&s;ale and retail trade are generally le&s;s in the capital than in &s;mall towns and country villages, yet great fortunes are frequently acquired from
<PB N="140" REF="153">
&s;mall beginnings in the former, and &s;carce ever in the latter. In &s;mall towns and country villages, on account of the narrowne&s;s of the market, trade cannot always be extended as &s;tock extends. In &s;uch places, therefore, though the rate of a particular per&s;on's profits may be very high, the &s;um or amount of them can never be very great, nor con&s;equently that of his annual accumulation. In great towns, on the contrary, trade can be extended as &s;tock increa&s;es, and the credit of a frugal and thriving man in|crea&s;es much &s;a&s;ter than his &s;tock. His trade is extended in pro|portion to the amount of both, and the &s;um or amount of his profits is in proportion to the extent of his trade, and his annual accumulation in proportion to the amount of his profits. It &s;eldom happens, however, that great fortunes are made even in great towns by any one regular, e&s;tabli&s;hed, and well known branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, but in con&s;equence of a long life of indu&s;try, frugality, and attention. Sudden fortunes, indeed, are &s;ometimes made in &s;uch places by what is called the trade of &s;peculation. The &s;pe|culative merchant exerci&s;es no one regular, e&s;tabli&s;hed, or well known branch of bu&s;ine&s;s. He is a corn merchant this year, and a wine merchant the next, and a &s;ugar, tobacco, or tea merchant the year after. He enters into every trade when he fore&s;ees that it is likely to be more than commonly profitable, and he quits it when he fore&s;ees that its profits are likely to return to the level of other trades. His profits and lo&s;&s;es, therefore, can bear no regu|lar proportion to tho&s;e of any one e&s;tabli&s;hed and well known branch of bu&s;ine&s;s. A bold adventurer may &s;ometimes acquire a con&s;iderable fortune by two or three &s;ucce&s;sful &s;peculations; but is ju&s;t as likely to lo&s;e one by two or three un&s;ucce&s;sful ones. This trade can be carried on no where but in great towns. It is only in places of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive commerce and corre&s;pondence that the intelligence requi&s;ite for it can be had.</P>
<P>THE five circum&s;tances above mentioned, though they occa&s;ion con&s;iderable inequalities in the wages of labour and profits of &s;tock,
<PB N="141" REF="154">
occa&s;ion none in the whole of the advantages and di&s;advantages, real or imaginary, of the different employments of either. The nature of tho&s;e circum&s;tances is &s;uch, that they make up for a &s;mall pecuniary gain in &s;ome, and counter-balance a great one in others.</P>
<P>IN order, however, that this equality may take place in the whole of their advantages or di&s;advantages, three things are re|qui&s;ite even where there is the mo&s;t perfect freedom. Fir&s;t, the employments mu&s;t be well known and long e&s;tabli&s;hed in the neigh|bourhood; &s;econdly, they mu&s;t be in their ordinary, or what may be called their natural &s;tate; and, thirdly, they mu&s;t be the &s;ole or principal employments of tho&s;e who occupy them.</P>
<P>FIRST, this equality can take place only in tho&s;e employments which are well known, and have been long e&s;tabli&s;hed in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>WHERE all other circum&s;tances are equal, wages are generally higher in new than in old trades. When a projector attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h a new manufacture, he mu&s;t at fir&s;t entice his work|men from other employments by higher wages than they can either earn in their own trades, or than the nature of his work would otherwi&s;e require, and a con&s;iderable time mu&s;t pa&s;s away before he can venture to reduce them to the common level. Manufac|tures for which the demand ari&s;es altogether from fa&s;hion and fancy, are continually changing, and &s;eldom la&s;t long enough to be con&s;idered as old e&s;tabli&s;hed manufactures. Tho&s;e, on the con|trary, for which the demand ari&s;es chiefly from u&s;e or nece&s;&s;ity, are le&s;s liable to change, and the &s;ame form or fabrick may continue in demand for whole centuries together. The wages of labour, therefore, are likely to be higher in manufactures of the former,
<PB N="142" REF="155">
than in tho&s;e of the latter kind. Birmingham deals chiefly in ma|nufactures of the former kind; Sheffield in tho&s;e of the latter; and the wages of labour in tho&s;e two different places, are &s;aid to be &s;uitable to this difference in the nature of their manufactures.</P>
<P>THE e&s;tabli&s;hment of any new manufacture, of any new branch of commerce, or of any new practice in agriculture, is always a &s;peculation, from which the projector promi&s;es him&s;elf extraordi|nary profits. The&s;e profits &s;ometimes are very great, and &s;ome|times, more frequently, perhaps, they are quite otherwi&s;e; but in general they bear no regular proportion to tho&s;e of other old trades in the neighbourhood. If the project &s;ucceeds, they are commonly at fir&s;t very high. When the trade or practice becomes thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed and well known, the competition reduces them to the level of other trades.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, this equality in the whole of the advantages and di&s;|advantages of the different employments of labour and &s;tock, can take place only in the ordinary, or what may be called the natural &s;tate of tho&s;e employments.</P>
<P>THE demand for almo&s;t every different &s;pecies of labour, is &s;ometimes greater and &s;ometimes le&s;s than u&s;ual. In the one ca&s;e the advantages of the employment ri&s;e above, in the other they fall below the common level. The demand for country labour is greater at hay-time and harve&s;t, than during the greater part of the year; and wages ri&s;e with the demand. In time of war, when forty or fifty thou&s;and &s;ailors are forced from the merchant &s;ervice into that of the king, the demand for &s;ailors to merchant &s;hips nece&s;&s;arily ri&s;es with their &s;carcity, and their wages upon &s;uch occa&s;ions commonly ri&s;e from a guinea and &s;even and twenty &s;hillings, to forty &s;hillings and three pounds a month. In a de|caying
<PB N="143" REF="156">
manufacture, on the contrary, many workmen, rather than quit their old trade, are contented with &s;maller wages than would otherwi&s;e be &s;uitable to the nature of their employ|ment.</P>
<P>THE profits of &s;tock vary with the price of the commodities in which it is employed. As the price of any commodity ri&s;es above the ordinary or average rate, the profits of at lea&s;t &s;ome part of the &s;tock that is employed in bringing it to market, ri&s;e above their proper level, and as it falls they &s;ink below it. All com|modities are more or le&s;s liable to variations of price, but &s;ome are much more &s;o than others. In all commodities which are pro|duced by human indu&s;try, the quantity of indu&s;try annually em|ployed is nece&s;&s;arily regulated by the annual demand, in &s;uch a manner that the average annual produce may, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible; be equal to the average annual con&s;umption. In &s;ome employments, it has already been ob&s;erved, the &s;ame quantity of in|du&s;try will always produce the &s;ame, or very nearly the &s;ame quan|tity of commodities. In the linen or woollen manufactures, for example, the &s;ame number of hands will annually work up very nearly the &s;ame quantity of linen and woollen cloth. The varia|tions in the market price of &s;uch commodities, therefore, can ari&s;e only from &s;ome accidental variation in the demand. A publick mourning rai&s;es the price of black cloth. But as the demand for mo&s;t &s;orts of plain linen and woollen cloth is pretty uniform, &s;o is likewi&s;e the price. But there are other employments in which the &s;ame quantity of indu&s;try will not always produce the &s;ame quantity of commodities. The &s;ame quantity of indu&s;try, for example, will, in different years, produce very different quantities of corn, wine, hops, &s;ugar, tobacco, &amp;c. The price of &s;uch commodities, therefore, varies not only with the variations of demand, but with the much greater and more frequent variations of quantity, and is con&s;equently ex|treamly fluctuating. But the profit of &s;ome of the dealers mu&s;t
<PB N="144" REF="157">
nece&s;&s;arily fluctuate with the price of the commodities. The ope|rations of the &s;peculative merchant are principally employed about &s;uch commodities. He endeavours to buy them up when he fore|&s;ees that their price is likely to ri&s;e, and to &s;ell them when it is likely to fall.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, This equality in the whole of the advantages and di&s;advantages of the different employments of labour and &s;tock, can take place only in &s;uch as are the &s;ole or principal employments of tho&s;e who occupy them.</P>
<P>WHEN a per&s;on derives his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from one employment, which does not occupy the greater part of his time; in the inter|vals of his lei&s;ure he is often willing to work at another for le&s;s wages than would otherwi&s;e &s;uit the nature of the employ|ment.</P>
<P>THERE &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in many parts of Scotland a &s;et of people called Cotters or Cottagers, though they were more frequent &s;ome years ago than they are now. They are a &s;ort of out-&s;ervants of the landlords and farmers. The u&s;ual reward which they receive from their ma&s;ters is a hou&s;e, a &s;mall garden for pot-herbs, as much gra&s;s as will feed a cow, and, perhaps, an acre or two of bad arable land. When their ma&s;ter has occa&s;ion for their labour, he gives them, be&s;ides, two pecks of oatmeal a week, worth about &s;ixteen-pence &s;terling. During a great part of the year he has little or no occa&s;ion for their labour, and the cultivation of their own little po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is not &s;ufficient to occupy the time which is left at their own di&s;po&s;al. When &s;uch occupiers were more nu|merous than they are at pre&s;ent, they are &s;aid to have been willing to give their &s;pare time for a very &s;mall recompence to any body, and to have wrought for le&s;s wages than other labourers. In an|tient

times they &s;eem to have been common all over Europe. In countries ill cultivated and wor&s;e inhabited, the greater part of landlords and farmers could not otherwi&s;e provide them&s;elves with the extraordinary number of hands, which country labour requires at certain &s;ea&s;ons. The daily or weekly recompence which &s;uch labourers occa&s;ionally received from their ma&s;ters, was evidently not the whole price of their labour. Their &s;mall tenement made a con&s;iderable part of it. This daily or weekly recompence, how|ever, &s;eems to have been con&s;idered as the whole of it, by many writers who have collected the prices of labour and provi&s;ions in antient times, and who have taken plea&s;ure in repre&s;enting both as wonderfully low.</P>
<P>THE produce of &s;uch labour comes frequently cheaper to market than would otherwi&s;e be &s;uitable to its nature. Stockings in many parts of Scotland are knit much cheaper than they can any where be wrought upon the loom. They are the work of &s;ervants and la|bourers, who derive the principal part of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from &s;ome other employment. More than a thou&s;and pair of Shetland &s;tockings are annually imported into Leith, of which the price is from five-pence to &s;even-pence a pair. At Learwick, the &s;mall capital of the Shetland i&s;lands, ten-pence a day, I have been a&s;|&s;ured, is a common price of common labour. In the &s;ame i&s;lands they knit wor&s;ted &s;tockings to the value of a guinea a pair and upwards.</P>
<P>THE &s;pinning of linen yarn is carried on in Scotland nearly in the &s;ame way as the knitting of &s;tockings, by &s;ervants who are chiefly hired for other purpo&s;es. They earn but a very &s;canty &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, who endeavour to get their whole livelihood by either of tho&s;e trades. In mo&s;t parts of Scotland &s;he is a good &s;pinner who can earn twenty-pence a week.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="159">
IN opulent countries the market is generally &s;o exten&s;ive, that any one trade is &s;ufficient to employ the whole labour and &s;tock of tho&s;e who occupy it. In&s;tances of people's living by one employ|ment, and at the &s;ame time deriving &s;ome little advantage from another, occur chiefly in poor countries. The following in&s;tance, however, of &s;omething of the &s;ame kind is to be found in the capital of a very rich one. There is no city in Europe, I believe, in which hou&s;e-rent is dearer than in London, and yet I know no capital in which a furni&s;hed apartment can be hired &s;o cheap. Lodging is not only much cheaper in London than in Paris; it is much cheaper than in Edinburgh of the &s;ame degree of goodne&s;s; and what may &s;eem extraordinary, the dearne&s;s of hou&s;e-rent is the cau&s;e of the cheapne&s;s of lodging. The dearne&s;s of hou&s;e-rent in London, ari&s;es, not only from tho&s;e cau&s;es which render it dear in all great capitals, the dearne&s;s of labour, the dearne&s;s of all the materials of building, which mu&s;t generally be brought from a great di&s;tance, and above all the dearne&s;s of ground-rent, every landlord acting the part of a monopoli&s;t, and frequently exacting a higher rent for a &s;ingle acre of bad land in a town, than can be had for a hundred of the be&s;t in the country; but it ari&s;es in part from the peculiar manners and cu&s;toms of the people, which oblige every ma&s;ter of a family to hire a whole hou&s;e from top to bottom. A dwelling-hou&s;e in England means every thing that is contained under the &s;ame roof. In France, Scotland, and many other parts of Europe, it frequently means no more than a &s;ingle &s;tory. A trade&s;man in London is obliged to hire a whole hou&s;e in that part of the town where his cu&s;tomers live. His &s;hop is upon the ground|floor, and he and his family &s;leep in the garret; and he endeavours to pay a part of his hou&s;e-rent by letting the two middle &s;tories to lodgers. He expects to maintain his family by his trade, and not by his lodgers. Whereas, at Paris and Edinburgh, the people who let lodgings, have commonly no other means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence;
<PB N="147" REF="160">
and the price of the lodging mu&s;t pay, not only the rent of the hou&s;e, but the whole expence of the family.</P>

<HEAD>PART II. <HI>Inequalities occa&s;ioned by the Policy of Europe.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SUCH are the inequalities in the whole of the advantages and di&s;advantages of the different employments of labour and &s;tock, which the defect of any of the three requi&s;ites above mentioned mu&s;t occa&s;ion, even where there is the mo&s;t perfect liberty. But the policy of Europe, by not leaving things at perfect liberty, oc|ca&s;ions other inequalities of much greater importance.</P>
<P>IT does this chiefly in the three following ways. Fir&s;t, by re|&s;training the competition in &s;ome employments to a &s;maller num|ber than would otherwi&s;e be di&s;po&s;ed to enter into them; &s;econdly, by increa&s;ing it in others beyond what it naturally would be; and, thirdly, by ob&s;tructing the free circulation of labour and &s;tock, both from employment to employment and from place to place.</P>
<P>FIRST, The policy of Europe occa&s;ions a very important ine|quality in the whole of the advantages and di&s;advantages of the different employments of labour and &s;tock, by re&s;training the competition in &s;ome employments to a &s;maller number than might otherwi&s;e be di&s;po&s;ed to enter into them.</P>
<P>THE exclu&s;ive privileges of corporations are the principal means it makes u&s;e of for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE exclu&s;ive privilege of an incorporated trade nece&s;&s;arily re&s;trains the competition, in the town where it is e&s;tabli&s;hed, to
<PB N="148" REF="161">
tho&s;e who are free of the trade. To have &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip in the town, under a ma&s;ter properly qualified, is commonly the nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ite for obtaining this freedom. The bye-laws of the corporation regulate &s;ometimes the number of apprentices which any ma&s;ter is allowed to have, and almo&s;t always the number of years which each apprentice is obliged to &s;erve. The intention of both regulations is to re&s;train the competition to a much &s;maller number than might otherwi&s;e be di&s;po&s;ed to enter into the trade. The limitation of the number of apprentices re&s;trains it directly. A long term of apprentice&s;hip re&s;trains it more indirectly, but as effectually, by increa&s;ing the expence of education.</P>
<P>IN Sheffield no ma&s;ter cutler can have more than one apprentice at a time, by a bye-law of the corporation. In Norfolk and Nor|wich no ma&s;ter weaver can have more than two apprentices, under pain of forfeiting five pounds a month to the king. No ma&s;ter hatter can have more than two apprentices any where in England, or in the Engli&s;h plantations, under pain of forfeiting five pounds a month, half to the king, and half to him who &s;hall &s;ue in any court of record. Both the&s;e regulations, though they have been confirmed by a publick law of the kingdom, are evidently dic|tated by the &s;ame corporation &s;pirit which enacted the bye-law of Sheffield. The &s;ilk weavers in London had &s;carce been in|corporated a year when they enacted a bye-law re&s;training any ma&s;ter from having more than two apprentices at a time. It re|quired a particular act of parliament to re&s;cind this bye-law.</P>
<P>SEVEN years &s;eem antiently to have been, all over Europe, the u&s;ual term e&s;tabli&s;hed for the duration of apprentice&s;hips in the greater part of incorporated trades. All &s;uch incorporations were antiently called univer&s;ities; which indeed is the proper Latin name for any incorporation whatever. The univer&s;ity of &s;miths, the univer&s;ity of taylors, &amp;c. are expre&s;&s;ions which we commonly
<PB N="149" REF="162">
meet with in the old charters of antient towns. When tho&s;e par|ticular incorporations which are now peculiarly called univer&s;ities were fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, the term of years which it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tudy, in order to obtain the degree of ma&s;ter of arts, appears evidently to have been copied from the term of apprentice&s;hip in common trades, of which the incorporations were much more antient. As to have wrought &s;even years under a ma&s;ter properly qualified, was nece&s;&s;ary in order to intitle any per&s;on to become a ma&s;ter and to have him&s;elf apprentices in a common trade; &s;o to have &s;tudied &s;even years under a ma&s;ter properly qualified, was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to entitle him to become a ma&s;ter, teacher, or doctor (words antiently &s;ynonimous) in the liberal arts, and to have &s;cholars or apprentices (words likewi&s;e originally &s;ynonimous) to &s;tudy under him.</P>
<P>BY the 5th of Elizabeth, commonly called the Statute of Ap|prentice&s;hip, it was enacted, that no per&s;on &s;hould for the future exerci&s;e any trade, craft, or mi&s;tery at that time exerci&s;ed in England, unle&s;s he had previou&s;ly &s;erved to it an apprentice&s;hip of &s;even years at lea&s;t; and what before had been the bye-law of many particular corporations, became in England the general and public law of all trades carried on in market towns. For though the words of the &s;tatute are very general, and &s;eem plainly to include the whole kingdom, by interpretation its operation has been limited to market-towns, it having been held that in country villages a per&s;on may exerci&s;e &s;everal different trades, though he has not &s;erved a &s;even years apprentice&s;hip to each, they being nece&s;&s;ary for the conveniency of the inhabitants, and the number of people frequently not being &s;ufficient to &s;upply each with a particular &s;ett of hands.</P>
<P>BY a &s;trict interpretation of the words too the operation of this &s;tatute has been limited to tho&s;e trades which were e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="150" REF="163">
in England before the 5th of Elizabeth, and has never been extended to &s;uch as have been introduced &s;ince that time. This limitation has given occa&s;ion to &s;everal di&s;tinctions which, con|&s;idered as rules of police, appear as fooli&s;h as can well be imagined. It has been adjudged, for example, that a coach-maker can nei|ther him&s;elf make nor employ journeymen to make his coach-wheels, but mu&s;t buy them of a ma&s;ter wheel-wright; this latter trade having been exerci&s;ed in England before the 5th of Eli|zabeth. But a wheel-wright, though he has never &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip to a coach-maker, may either him&s;elf make or employ journeymen to make coaches; the trade of a coach-maker not being within the &s;tatute, becau&s;e not exerci&s;ed in England at the time when it was made. The manufactures of Manche&s;ter, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton, are many of them, upon this account, not within the &s;tatute; not having been exerci&s;ed in England before the 5th of Elizabeth.</P>
<P>IN France, the duration of apprentice&s;hips is different in dif|ferent towns and in different trades. In Paris, five years is the term required in a great number; but before any per&s;on can be qualified to exerci&s;e the trade as a ma&s;ter, he mu&s;t, in many of them, &s;erve five years more as a journeyman. During this latter term he is called the companion of his ma&s;ter, and the term it&s;elf is called his companion&s;hip.</P>
<P>IN Scotland there is no general law which regulates univer&s;ally the duration of apprentice&s;hips. The term is different in different corporations. Where it is long, a part of it may generally be redeemed by paying a &s;mall fine. In mo&s;t towns too a very &s;mall fine is &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e the freedom of any corporation. The wea|vers of linen and hempen cloth, the principal manufactures of the country, as well as all other artificers &s;ub&s;ervient to them, wheel-makers, reel-makers, &amp;c. may exerci&s;e their trades in any
<PB N="151" REF="164">
town corporate without paying any fine. In all towns corporate all per&s;ons are free to &s;ell butchers-meat upon any lawful day of the week. Three years is in Scotland a common term of ap|prentice&s;hip even in &s;ome very nice trades, and in general I know of no country in Europe in which corporation laws are &s;o little oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>THE property which every man has in his own labour, as it is the original foundation of all other property, &s;o it is the mo&s;t &s;acred and inviolable. The patrimony of a poor man lies in the &s;trength and dexterity of his hands; and to hinder him from employing this &s;trength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper without injury to his neighbour, is a plain violation of this mo&s;t &s;acred property. It is a manife&s;t encroachment upon the ju&s;t liberty both of the workman, and of tho&s;e who might be di&s;po&s;ed to employ him. As it hinders the one from working at what he thinks proper, &s;o it hinders the other from employing whom they think proper. To judge whether he is fit to be em|ployed, may &s;urely be tru&s;ted to the di&s;cretion of the employers who&s;e intere&s;t it &s;o much concerns. The affected anxiety of the law-giver le&s;t they &s;hould employ an improper per&s;on, is evidently as impertinent as it is oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>THE in&s;titution of long apprentice&s;hips can give no &s;ecurity that in&s;ufficient workman&s;hip &s;hall not frequently be expo&s;ed to publick &s;ale. When this is done it is generally the effect of fraud, and not of inability; and the longe&s;t apprentice&s;hip can give no &s;ecurity again&s;t fraud. Quite different regulations are nece&s;&s;ary to prevent this abu&s;e. The &s;terling mark upon plate, and the &s;tamps upon linen and woollen cloth, give the purcha&s;er much greater &s;ecurity than any &s;tatute of apprentice&s;hip. He generally looks at the&s;e, but never thinks it worth while to enquire whether the workman had &s;erved a &s;even years apprentice&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="165">
THE in&s;titution of long apprentice&s;hips has no tendency to form young people to indu&s;try. A journeyman who works by the piece is likely to be indu&s;trious, becau&s;e he derives a benefit from every exertion of his indu&s;try. An apprentice is likely to be idle, and almo&s;t always is &s;o, becau&s;e he has no immediate intere&s;t to be otherwi&s;e. In the inferior employments, the &s;weets of labour con&s;i&s;t altogether in the recompence of labour. They who are &s;oone&s;t in a condition to enjoy the &s;weets of it, are likely &s;oone&s;t to conceive a reli&s;h for it, and to acquire the early habit of indu&s;try. A young man naturally conceives an aver&s;ion to labour, when for a long time he receives no benefit from it. The boys who are put out apprentices from publick charities are generally bound for more than the u&s;ual number of years, and they generally turn out very idle and worthle&s;s.</P>
<P>APPRENTICESHIPS were altogether unknown to the antients. The reciprocal duties of ma&s;ter and apprentice make a con&s;iderable article in every modern code. The Roman law is perfectly &s;ilent with regard to them. I know no Greek or Latin word (I might venture, I believe, to a&s;&s;ert that there is none) which expre&s;&s;es the idea we now annex to the word Apprentice, a &s;ervant bound to work at a particular trade for the benefit of a ma&s;ter, during a term of years, upon condition that the ma&s;ter &s;hall teach him that trade.</P>
<P>LONG apprentice&s;hips are altogether unnece&s;&s;ary. The arts, which are much &s;uperior to common trades, &s;uch as tho&s;e of making clocks and watches, contain no &s;uch my&s;tery as to require a long cour&s;e of in&s;truction. The fir&s;t invention of &s;uch beautiful ma|chines, indeed, and even that of &s;ome of the in&s;truments employed in making them, mu&s;t, no doubt, have been the work of deep thought and long time, and may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as among the
<PB N="153" REF="166">
happie&s;t efforts of human ingenuity. But when both have been fairly invented and are well under&s;tood, to explain to any young man, in the compleate&s;t manner, how to apply the in&s;truments and how to con&s;truct the machines, cannot well require more than the le&s;&s;ons of a few weeks: perhaps tho&s;e of a few days might be &s;ufficient. In the common mechanick trades, tho&s;e of a few days might certainly be &s;ufficient. The dexterity of hand, indeed, even in common trades, cannot be acquired without much practice and experience. But a young man would practi&s;e with much more diligence and attention, if from the beginning he wrought as a journeyman, being paid in proportion to the little work which he could execute, and paying in his turn for the materials which he might &s;ometimes &s;poil through aukwardne&s;s and inexperience. His education would generally in this way be more effectual, and always le&s;s tedious and expen&s;ive. The ma&s;ter, indeed, would be a lo&s;er. He would lo&s;e all the wages of the apprentice, which he now &s;aves, for &s;even years together. In the end, perhaps, the apprentice him&s;elf would be a lo&s;er. In a trade &s;o ea&s;ily learnt he would have more competitors, and his wages, when he came to be a compleat workman, would be much le&s;s than at pre&s;ent. The &s;ame increa&s;e of competition would reduce the profits of the ma&s;ters as well as the wages of the workmen. The trades, the crafts, the my&s;teries, would all be lo&s;ers. But the public would be a gainer, the work of all artificers coming in this way much cheaper to market.</P>
<P>IT is to prevent this reduction of price, and con&s;equently of wages and profit, by re&s;training that free competition which would mo&s;t certainly occa&s;ion it, that all corporations, and the greater part of cor|poration laws, have been e&s;tabli&s;hed. In order to erect a corporation, no other authority in antient times was requi&s;ite in many parts of Europe, but that of the town corporate in which it was e&s;tabli&s;hed.
<PB N="154" REF="167">
In England, indeed, a charter from the king was likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary. But this prerogative of the crown &s;eems to have been re&s;erved rather for extorting money from the &s;ubject, than for the defence of the common liberty again&s;t &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ive monopolies. Upon paying a fine to the king, the charter &s;eems generally to have been readily granted; and when any particular cla&s;s of artificers or traders thought proper to act as a corporation without a charter, &s;uch adulterine guilds, as they were called, were not always di&s;franchi&s;ed upon that account, but obliged to fine annually to the king for permi&s;&s;ion to exerci&s;e their u&s;urped privileges. The immediate in&s;pection of all corporations, and of the bye-laws which they might think proper to enact for their own government, belonged to the town corporate in which they were e&s;tabli&s;hed; and whatever di&s;|cipline was exerci&s;ed over them, proceeded commonly, not from the king, but from that greater incorporation of which tho&s;e &s;ubordinate ones were only parts or members.</P>
<P>THE government of towns corporate was altogether in the hands of traders and artificers; and it was the manife&s;t intere&s;t of every particular cla&s;s of them, to prevent the market from being over&s;tocked, as they commonly expre&s;s it, with their own particular &s;pecies of indu&s;try; which is in reality, to keep it always under|&s;tocked. Each cla&s;s was eager to e&s;tabli&s;h regulations proper for this purpo&s;e, and, provided it was allowed to do &s;o, was willing to con&s;ent that every other cla&s;s &s;hould do the &s;ame. In con&s;equence of &s;uch regulations, indeed, each cla&s;s was obliged to buy the goods they had occa&s;ion for from every other within the town, &s;omewhat dearer than they otherwi&s;e might have done. But in recompence, they were enabled to &s;ell their own ju&s;t as much dearer; &s;o that &s;o far it was as broad as long, as they &s;ay; and in the dealings of the different cla&s;&s;es within the town with one another, none of them were lo&s;ers by the&s;e regulations. But in their dealings with the
<PB N="155" REF="168">
country they were all great gainers; and in the&s;e latter deal|ings con&s;i&s;ts the whole trade which &s;upports and enriches every town.</P>
<P>EVERY town draws its whole &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and all the materials of its indu&s;try, from the country. It pays for the&s;e chiefly in two ways: fir&s;t, by &s;ending back to the country a part of tho&s;e materials wrought up and manufactured; in which ca&s;e their price is augmented by the wages of the workmen, and the profits of their ma&s;ters or immediate employers: &s;econdly, by &s;ending to it a part both of the rude and manufactured produce, either of other countries, or of di&s;tant parts of the &s;ame country, imported into the town; in which ca&s;e too the original price of tho&s;e goods is augmented by the wages of the carriers of &s;ailors, and by the pro|fits of the merchants who employ them. In what is gained upon the fir&s;t of tho&s;e two branches of commerce, con&s;i&s;ts the advantage which the town makes by its manufactures; in what is gained upon the &s;econd, the advantage of its inland and foreign trade. The wages of the workmen, and the profits of their different em|ployers, make up the whole of what is gained upon both. What|ever regulations, therefore, tend to increa&s;e tho&s;e wages and profits beyond what they otherwi&s;e would be, tend to enable the town to purcha&s;e, with a &s;maller quantity of its labour, the pro|duce of a greater quantity of the labour of the country. They give the traders and artificers in the town an advantage over the landlords, farmers, and labourers in the country, and break down that natural equality which would otherwi&s;e take place in the commerce which is carried on between them. The whole annual produce of the labour of the &s;ociety is annually divided between tho&s;e two different &s;etts of people. By means of tho&s;e regulations a greater &s;hare of it is given to the inhabitants of the town than would otherwi&s;e fall to them; and a le&s;s to tho&s;e of the country.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="169">
THE price which the town really pays for the provi&s;ions and materials annually imported into it, is the quantity of manufactures and other goods annually exported from it. The dearer the latter are &s;old, the cheaper the former are bought. The indu&s;try of the town becomes more, and that of the country le&s;s advantageous.</P>
<P>THAT the indu&s;try which is carried on in towns is, every where in Europe, more advantageous than that which is carried on in the country, without entering into any very nice computations, we may &s;atisfy our&s;elves by one very &s;imple and obvious ob&s;ervation. In every country of Europe we find, at lea&s;t, a hundred people who have acquired great fortunes from &s;mall beginnings by trade and manufactures, the indu&s;try which properly belongs to towns, for one who has done &s;o by that which properly belongs to the country, the rai&s;ing of rude produce by the improvement and cultivation of land. Indu&s;try, therefore, mu&s;t be better rewarded, the wages of labour and the profits of &s;tock mu&s;t evidently be greater in the one &s;ituation than in the other. But &s;tock and labour naturally &s;eek the mo&s;t advantageous employment. They naturally, therefore, re&s;ort as much as they can to the town, and de&s;ert the country.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of a town, being collected into one place, can ea&s;ily combine together. The mo&s;t in&s;ignificant trades carried on in towns have accordingly, in &s;ome place or other, been incorporated; and even where they have never been incorporated, yet the corporation &s;pirit, the jealou&s;y of &s;trangers, the aver&s;ion to take apprentices, or to communicate the &s;ecret of their trade, generally prevail in them, and often teach them, by voluntary a&s;&s;ociations and agree|ments, to prevent that free competition which they cannot pro|hibit by bye-laws. The trades which employ but a &s;mall number of hands, run mo&s;t ea&s;ily into &s;uch combinations. Half a dozen wool-combers perhaps are nece&s;&s;ary to keep a thou&s;and &s;pinners
<PB N="157" REF="170">
and weavers at work. By combining not to take apprentices they can not only engro&s;s the employment, but reduce the whole manu|facture into a &s;ort of &s;lavery to them&s;elves, and rai&s;e the price of their labour much above what is due to the nature of their work.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of the country, di&s;per&s;ed in di&s;tant places, cannot ea&s;ily combine together. They have not only never been incorporated, but the corporation &s;pirit never has prevailed among them. No apprentice&s;hip has ever been thought nece&s;&s;ary to qualify for hu&s;bandry, the great trade of the country. After what are called the fine arts, and the liberal profe&s;&s;ions, however, there is perhaps no trade which requires &s;o great a variety of know|ledge and experience. The innumerable volumes which have been written upon it in all languages, may &s;atisfy us, that among the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t learned nations, it has never been regarded as a matter very ea&s;ily under&s;tood. And from all tho&s;e volumes we &s;hall in vain attempt to collect that knowledge of its various and complicated operations, which is commonly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed even by the common farmer; how contemptuou&s;ly &s;oever the very contemptible authors of &s;ome of them may &s;ometimes affect to &s;peak of him. There is &s;carce any common mechanick trade, on the contrary, of which all the operations may not be as compleatly and di&s;tinctly explained in a pamphlet of a very few pages, as it is po&s;&s;ible for words illu&s;trated by figures to explain them. In the hi&s;tory of the arts, now publi&s;hing by the French academy of &s;ciences, &s;everal of them are actually explained in this manner. The direction of operations, be&s;ides, which mu&s;t be varied with every change of the weather, as well as with many other accidents, requires much more judgement and di&s;cretion, than that of tho&s;e which are always the &s;ame or very nearly the &s;ame.</P>

NOT only the art of the farmer, the general direction of the operations of hu&s;bandry, but many inferior branches of country labour require much more &s;kill and experience than the greater part of mechanick trades. The man who works upon bra&s;s and iron, works with in&s;truments and upon materials of which the temper is always the &s;ame, or very nearly the &s;ame. But the man who ploughs the ground with a team of hor&s;es or oxen, works with in&s;truments of which the health, &s;trength, and temper are very different upon different occa&s;ions. The condition of the materials which he works upon too is as variable as that of the in&s;truments which he works with, and both require to be managed with much judgement and di&s;cretion. The common ploughman, though generally regarded as the pattern of &s;tupidity and ignorance, is &s;eldom defective in this judgement and di&s;cretion. He is le&s;s accu&s;tomed, indeed, to &s;ocial intercour&s;e than the mechanick who lives in a town. His voice and language are more uncouth and more difficult to be under&s;tood by tho&s;e who are not u&s;ed to them. His under&s;tanding, however, being accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider a greater variety of objects, is generally much &s;uperior to that of the other, who&s;e whole attention from morning till night is commonly oc|cupied in performing one or two very &s;imple operations. How much the lower ranks of people in the country are really &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the town, is well known to every man whom either bu&s;ine&s;s or curio&s;ity has led to conver&s;e much with both. In China and Indo&s;tan accordingly both the rank and the wages of country labourers are &s;aid to be &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the greater part of artificers and manufacturers. They would probably be &s;o every where, if corporation laws and the corporation &s;pirit did not pre|vent it.</P>
<P>THE &s;uperiority which the indu&s;try of the towns has every where in Europe over that of the country, is not altogether owing
<PB N="159" REF="172">
to corporations and corporation laws. It is &s;upported by many other regulations. The high duties upon foreign manufactures and upon all goods imported by alien merchants, all tend to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Corporation laws enable the inhabitants of towns to rai&s;e their prices, without fearing to be under-&s;old by the free competition of their own countrymen. Tho&s;e other regulations &s;ecure them equally again&s;t that of foreigners. The enhancement of price occa&s;ioned by both is every where finally paid by the landlords, farmers, and labourers of the country, who have &s;eldom oppo&s;ed the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch monopolies. They have com|monly neither inclination nor fitne&s;s to enter into combinations; and the clamour and &s;ophi&s;try of merchants and manufacturers ea&s;ily per&s;uade them that the private intere&s;t of a part, and of a &s;ub|ordinate part of the &s;ociety, is the general intere&s;t of the whole.</P>
<P>IN Great Britain the &s;uperiority of the indu&s;try of the towns over that of the country, &s;eems to have been greater formerly than in the pre&s;ent times. The wages of country labour ap|proach nearer to tho&s;e of manufacturing labour, and the profits of &s;tock employed in agriculture to tho&s;e of trading and manu|facturing &s;tock, than they are &s;aid to have done in the la&s;t century, or in the beginning of the pre&s;ent. This change may be regarded as the nece&s;&s;ary, though very late con&s;equence of the extraordinary encouragement given to the indu&s;try of the towns. The &s;tock accumulated in them comes in time to be &s;o great, that it can no longer be employed with the antient profit in that &s;pecies of in|du&s;try which is peculiar to them. That indu&s;try has its limits like every other; and the increa&s;e of &s;tock, by increa&s;ing the com|petition, nece&s;&s;arily reduces the profit. The lowering of profit in the town forces out &s;tock to the country, where, by creating a new demand for country labour, it nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;es its wages. It then &s;preads it&s;elf, if I may &s;ay &s;o, over the face of the land, and by
<PB N="160" REF="173">
being employed in agriculture is in part re&s;tored to the country, at the expence of which, in a great mea&s;ure, it had originally been accumulated in the town. That every where in Europe the greate&s;t improvements of the country have been owing to &s;uch overflowings of the &s;tock originally accumulated in the towns, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how hereafter; and at the &s;ame time to de|mon&s;trate, that though &s;ome countries have by this cour&s;e attained to a con&s;iderable degree of opulence, it is in it&s;elf nece&s;&s;arily &s;low, uncertain, liable to be di&s;turbed and interrupted by innumerable accidents, and in every re&s;pect contrary to the order of nature and of rea&s;on. The intere&s;ts, prejudices, laws and cu&s;toms which have given occa&s;ion to it, I &s;hall endeavour to explain as fully and di&s;tinctly as I can in the third and fourth books of this enquiry.</P>
<P>PEOPLE of the &s;ame trade &s;eldom meet together, even for merriment and diver&s;ion, but the conver&s;ation ends in a con&s;piracy again&s;t the publick, or in &s;ome contrivance to rai&s;e prices. It is impo&s;&s;ible indeed to prevent &s;uch meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be con&s;i&s;tent with liberty and ju&s;tice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the &s;ame trade from &s;ometimes a&s;&s;embling together, it ought to do no|thing to facilitate &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies; much le&s;s to render them ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>A REGULATION which obliges all tho&s;e of the &s;ame trade in a particular town to enter their names and places of abode in a publick regi&s;ter, facilitates &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies. It connects indivi|duals who might never otherwi&s;e be known to one another, and gives every man of the trade a direction where to find every other man of it.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="174">
A REGULATION which enables tho&s;e of the &s;ame trade to tax them&s;elves in order to provide for their poor, their &s;ick, their widows and orphans, by giving them a common intere&s;t to manage, renders &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>AN incorporation not only renders them nece&s;&s;ary, but makes the act of the majority binding upon the whole. In a free trade an effectual combination cannot be e&s;tabli&s;hed but by the unanimous con&s;ent of every &s;ingle member of it, and it cannot la&s;t longer than every &s;ingle member of it continues of the &s;ame mind. The majority of a corporation can enact a bye-law with proper penal|ties, which will limit the competition more effectually and more durably than any voluntary combination whatever.</P>
<P>THE pretence that corporations are nece&s;&s;ary for the better government of the trade, is without any foundation. The real and effectual di&s;cipline which is exerci&s;ed over a workman, is not that of his corporation, but that of his cu&s;tomers. It is the fear of lo&s;ing their employment which re&s;trains his frauds and corrects his negligence. An exclu&s;ive corporation nece&s;&s;arily weakens the force of this di&s;cipline. A particular &s;ett of work|men mu&s;t then be employed, let them behave well or ill. It is upon this account that in many large incorporated towns no tolerable workmen are to be found, even in &s;ome of the mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary trades. If you would have your work tolerably executed, it mu&s;t be done in the &s;uburbs, where the workmen having no exclu&s;ive privilege, have nothing but their character to depend upon, and you mu&s;t then &s;muggle it into the town as well as you can.</P>
<P>IT is in this manner that the policy of Europe, by re&s;training the competition in &s;ome employments to a &s;maller number than
<PB N="162" REF="175">
would otherwi&s;e be di&s;po&s;ed to enter into them, occa&s;ions a very important inequality in the whole of the advantages and di&s;ad|vantages of the different employments of labour and &s;tock.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, The policy of Europe, by increa&s;ing the compe|tition in &s;ome employments beyond what it naturally would be, occa&s;ions another inequality of an oppo&s;ite kind in the whole of the advantages and di&s;advantages of the different employments of labour and &s;tock.</P>
<P>IT has been con&s;idered as of &s;o much importance that a proper number of young people &s;hould be educated for certain profe&s;|&s;ions, that, &s;ometimes the publick, and &s;ometimes the piety of private founders have e&s;tabli&s;hed many pen&s;ions, &s;cholar&s;hips, ex|hibitions, bur&s;aries, &amp;c. for this purpo&s;e, which draw many more people into tho&s;e trades than could otherwi&s;e pretend to follow them. In all chri&s;tian countries, I believe, the education of the greater part of churchmen is paid for in this manner. Very few of them are educated altogether at their own expence. The long, tedious and expen&s;ive education, therefore, of tho&s;e who are, will not always procure them a &s;uitable reward, the church being crowded with people who, in order to get employment, are willing to accept of a much &s;maller recompence than what &s;uch an edu|cation would otherwi&s;e have entitled them to; and in this manner the competition of the poor takes away the reward of the rich. It would be indecent, no doubt, to compare either a curate or a chaplain with a journeyman in any common trade. The pay of a curate or chaplain, however, may very properly be con&s;idered as of the &s;ame nature with the wages of a journeyman. They are, all three, paid for their work according to the contract which they may happen to make with their re&s;pective &s;uperiors. Till after the middle of the fourteenth century, five merks, containing
<PB N="163" REF="176">
about as much &s;ilver as ten pounds of our pre&s;ent money, was in England the u&s;ual pay of a curate or &s;tipendiary pari&s;h prie&s;t, as we find it regulated by the decrees of &s;everal different national councils. At the &s;ame period four-pence a day, containing the &s;ame quantity of &s;ilver as a &s;hilling of our pre&s;ent money, was declared to be the pay of a ma&s;ter ma&s;on, and three-pence a day, equal to nine-pence of our pre&s;ent money, that of a journeyman ma&s;on. The wages of both the&s;e labourers, therefore, &s;uppo&s;ing them to have been con&s;tantly employed, were much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the curate. The wages of the ma&s;ter ma&s;on, &s;uppo&s;ing him to have been without employment one-third of the year, would have fully equalled them. By the 12th of Queen Anne, c. 12, it is declared, <Q>That whereas for want of &s;ufficient main|tenance and encouragement to curates, the cures have in &s;everal places been meanly &s;upplied, the bi&s;hop is, therefore, empow|ered to appoint by writing under his hand and &s;eal a &s;ufficient certain &s;tipend or allowance, not exceeding fifty and not le&s;s than twenty pounds a year.</Q> Forty pounds a year is reckoned at pre&s;ent very good pay for a curate, and notwith&s;tanding this act of parliament, there are many curacies under twenty pounds a year. There are journeymen &s;hoe-makers in London who earn forty pounds a year, and there is &s;carce an indu&s;trious workman of any kind in that metropolis who does not earn more than twenty. This la&s;t &s;um indeed does not exceed what is frequently earned by com|mon labourers in many country pari&s;hes. Whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen, it has always been rather to lower them than to rai&s;e them. But the law has upon many occa&s;ions attempted to rai&s;e the wages of curates, and for the dignity of the church, to oblige the rectors of pari&s;hes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they them|&s;elves might be willing to accept of. And in both ca&s;es the law &s;eems to have been equally ineffectual, and has never either been
<PB N="164" REF="177">
able to rai&s;e the wages of curates or to &s;ink tho&s;e of labourers to the degree that was intended; becau&s;e it has never been able to hinder either the one from being willing to accept of le&s;s than the legal allowance, on account of the indigence of their &s;ituation and the multitude of their competitors; or the other from receiving more, on account of the contrary competition of tho&s;e who expected to derive either profit or plea&s;ure from employing them.</P>
<P>THE great benefices and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities &s;upport the honour of the church, notwith&s;tanding the mean circum|&s;tances of &s;ome of its inferior members. The re&s;pect paid to the profe&s;&s;ion too makes &s;ome compen&s;ation even to them for the mean|ne&s;s of their pecuniary recompence. In England, and in all Roman Catholick countries, the lottery of the church is in reality much more advantageous than is nece&s;&s;ary. The example of the churches of Scotland, of Geneva, and of &s;everal other prote&s;tant churches, may &s;atisfy us that in &s;o creditable a profe&s;&s;ion, in which education is &s;o ea&s;ily procured, the hopes of much more moderate benefices will draw a &s;ufficient number of learned, decent and re&s;pectable men into holy orders.</P>
<P>IN profe&s;&s;ions in which there are no benefices, &s;uch as law and phy&s;ick, if an equal proportion of people were educated at the publick expence, the competition would &s;oon be &s;o great, as to &s;ink very much their pecuniary reward. It might then not be worth any man's while to educate his &s;on to either of tho&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ions at his own expence. They would be entirely abandoned to &s;uch as had been educated by tho&s;e publick charities, who&s;e numbers and nece&s;&s;ities would oblige them in general to content them&s;elves with a very mi&s;erable recompence, to the entire degra|dation of the now re&s;pectable profe&s;&s;ions of law and phy&s;ick.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="178">
THAT unpro&s;perous race of men commonly called men of letters, are pretty much in the &s;ituation which lawyers and phy&s;i|cians probably would be in upon the foregoing &s;uppo&s;ition. In every part of Europe the greater part of them have been educated for the church, but have been hindered by different rea&s;ons from entering into holy orders. They have generally, therefore, been educated at the publick expence, and their numbers are every where &s;o great as commonly to reduce the price of their labour to a very paultry recompence.</P>
<P>BEFORE the invention of the art of printing, the only employ|ment by which a man of letters could make any thing by his talents, was that of a publick teacher, or by communicating to other people the curious and u&s;eful knowledge which he had acquired him&s;elf: And this is &s;till &s;urely a more honourable, a more u&s;eful, and in general even a more profitable employment than that other of writing for a book&s;eller, to which the art of printing has given occa&s;ion. The time and &s;tudy, the genius, knowledge and application requi&s;ite to qualify an eminent teacher of the &s;ciences, are at lea&s;t equal to what is nece&s;&s;ary for the greate&s;t practitioners in law and phy&s;ick. But the u&s;ual reward of the emi|nent teacher bears no proportion to that of the lawyer or phy&s;i|cian; becau&s;e the trade of the one is crowded with indigent people, who have been brought up to it at the publick expence; whereas tho&s;e of the other two are incumbered with very few who have not been educated at their own. The u&s;ual recompence, however, of publick and private teachers, &s;mall as it may appear, would undoubtedly be le&s;s than it is, if the competition of tho&s;e yet more indigent men of letters who write for bread was not taken out of the market. Before the invention of the art of printing, a &s;cholar and a beggar &s;eem to have been terms very nearly &s;ynonymous. The different governors of the univer&s;ities before that time appear to have often granted licences to their &s;cholars to beg.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="179">
IN antient times, before any charities of this kind had been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for the education of indigent people to the learned profe&s;|&s;ions, the rewards of eminent teachers appear to have been much more con&s;iderable. I&s;ocrates, in what is called his di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t the &s;ophi&s;ts, reproaches the teachers of his own times with incon|&s;i&s;tency. ''They make the mo&s;t magnificent promi&s;es to their &s;cholars, &s;ays he, and undertake to teach them to be wi&s;e, to be happy, and to be ju&s;t, and in return for &s;o important a &s;ervice they &s;tipulate the paultry reward of four or five minae. They who teach wi&s;dom, continues he, ought certainly to be wi&s;e them&s;elves; but if any man was to &s;ell &s;uch a price, he would be convicted of the mo&s;t evident folly.'' He certainly does not mean here to exaggerate the reward, and we may be a&s;&s;ured that it was not le&s;s than he repre&s;ents it. Four minae were equal to thirteen pounds &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence: five minae to &s;ixteen pounds thirteen &s;hillings and four pence. Something not le&s;s than the large&s;t of tho&s;e two &s;ums, therefore, mu&s;t at that time have been u&s;ually paid to the mo&s;t eminent teachers at Athens. I&s;ocrates him&s;elf demanded ten minae, or thirty-three pounds &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence, from each &s;cholar. When he taught at Athens, he is &s;aid to have had an hundred &s;cholars. I under&s;tand this to be the number whom he taught at one time, or who attended what we would call one cour&s;e of lectures, a number which will not appear extraordinary from &s;o great a city to &s;o famous a teacher, who taught too what was at that time the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable of all &s;ciences, rhetorick. He mu&s;t have made, therefore, by each cour&s;e of lectures, a thou&s;and minae, or 3333<HI>l.</HI> 6<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> A thou|&s;and minae, accordingly, is &s;aid by Plutarch in another place, to have been his Didactron or u&s;ual price of teaching. Many other eminent teachers in tho&s;e times appear to have acquired great for|tunes. Gorgias made a pre&s;ent to the temple of Delphi of his own &s;tatue in &s;olid gold. We mu&s;t not, I pre&s;ume, &s;uppo&s;e that it
<PB N="167" REF="180">
was as large as the life. His way of living, as well as that of Hippias and Protagoras, two other eminent teachers of tho&s;e times, is repre&s;ented by Plato as &s;plendid even to o&s;tentation. Plato him&s;elf is &s;aid to have lived with a good deal of magnificence. Ari&s;totle, after having been tutor to Alexander and mo&s;t munifi|cently rewarded, as it is univer&s;ally agreed, both by him and his father Philip, thought it worth while, notwith&s;tanding, to return to Athens, in order to re&s;ume the teaching of his &s;chool. Teachers of the &s;ciences were probably in tho&s;e times le&s;s common than they came to be in an age or two afterwards, when the competition had probably &s;omewhat reduced both the price of their labour and the admiration for their per&s;ons. The mo&s;t eminent of them, however, appear always to have enjoyed a degree of con&s;ideration much &s;uperior to any of the like profe&s;&s;ion in the pre&s;ent times. The Athenians &s;ent Carneades the academick, and Diogenes the &s;toick, upon a &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y to Rome; and though their city had then declined from its former grandeur, it was &s;till an independent and con&s;iderable republick. Carneades too was a Babylonian by birth, and as there never was a people more jealous of admitting foreigners to publick offices than the Athenians, their con&s;ideration for him mu&s;t have been very great.</P>
<P>THIS inequality is upon the whole, perhaps, rather advantageous than hurtful to the publick. It may &s;omewhat degrade the profe&s;|&s;ion of a publick teacher; but the cheapne&s;s of literary education is &s;urely an advantage which greatly over-balances this trifling incon|veniency. The publick too might derive &s;till greater benefit from it, if the con&s;titution of tho&s;e &s;chools and colleges, in which educa|tion is carried on, was more rea&s;onable than it is at pre&s;ent through the greater part of Europe.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, The policy of Europe, by ob&s;tructing the free circu|lation of labour and &s;tock both from employment to employment,
<PB N="168" REF="181">
and from place to place, occa&s;ions in &s;ome ca&s;es a very inconve|nient inequality in the whole of the advantages and di&s;advantages of their different employments.</P>
<P>THE &s;tatute of apprentice&s;hip ob&s;tructs the free circulation of labour from one employment to another, even in the &s;ame place. The exclu&s;ive privileges of corporations ob&s;truct it from one place to another, even in the &s;ame employment.</P>
<P>IT frequently happens that while high wages are given to the workmen in one manufacture, tho&s;e in another are obliged to content them&s;elves with bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The one is in an ad|vancing &s;tate, and has, therefore, a continual demand for new hands: The other is in a declining &s;tate, and the &s;uper-abundance of hands is continually increa&s;ing. Tho&s;e two manufactures may &s;ometimes be in the &s;ame town, and &s;ometimes in the &s;ame neigh|bourhood, without being able to lend the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to one another. The &s;tatute of apprentice&s;hip may oppo&s;e it in the one ca&s;e, and both that and an exclu&s;ive corporation in the other. In many different manufactures, however, the operations are &s;o much alike, that the workmen could ea&s;ily change trades with one an|other, if tho&s;e ab&s;urd laws did not hinder them. The arts of weaving plain linen and plain &s;ilk, for example, are almo&s;t entirely the &s;ame. That of weaving plain woollen is &s;omewhat different; but the difference is &s;o in&s;ignificant that either a linen or a &s;ilk weaver might become a tolerable workman in a very few days. If any of tho&s;e three capital manufactures, therefore, were decaying, the workmen might find a re&s;ource in one of the other two which was in a more pro&s;perous condition; and their wages would neither ri&s;e too high in the thriving, nor &s;ink too low in the decaying manu|facture. The linen manufacture indeed is, in England, by a particular &s;tatute, open to every body; but as it is not much cul|tivated
<PB N="169" REF="182">
through the greater part of the country, it can afford no general re&s;ource to the workmen of other decaying manufactures, who, wherever the &s;tatute of apprentice&s;hip takes place, have no other choice but either to come upon the pari&s;h, or to work as common labourers, for which, by their habits, they are much wor&s;e qualified than for any &s;ort of manufacture that bears any re&s;em|blance to their own. They generally, therefore, chu&s;e to come upon the pari&s;h.</P>
<P>WHATEVER ob&s;tructs the free circulation of labour from one employment to another, ob&s;tructs that of &s;tock likewi&s;e; the quan|tity of &s;tock which can be employed in any branch of bu&s;ine&s;s depending very much upon that of labour which can be employed in it. Corporation laws, however, give le&s;s ob&s;truction to the free circulation of &s;tock from one place to another than to that of labour. It is every where much ea&s;ier for a wealthy merchant to obtain the privilege of trading in a town corporate, than for a poor artificer to obtain that of working in it.</P>
<P>THE ob&s;truction which corporation laws give to the free circu|lation of labour is common, I believe, to every part of Europe. That which is given to it by the poor laws, &s;o far as I know, is peculiar to England. It con&s;i&s;ts in the difficulty which a poor man finds in obtaining a &s;ettlement, or even in being allowed to exerci&s;e his indu&s;try in any pari&s;h but that to which he belongs. It is the labour of artificers and manufacturers only of which the free cir|culation is ob&s;tructed by corporation laws. The difficulty of obtaining &s;ettlements ob&s;tructs even that of common labour. It may be worth while to give &s;ome account of the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and pre&s;ent &s;tate of this di&s;order, the greate&s;t perhaps of any in the police of England.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="183">
WHEN by the de&s;truction of mona&s;teries the poor had been deprived of the charity of tho&s;e religious hou&s;es, after &s;ome other ineffectual attempts for their relief, it was enacted by the 43d of Elizabeth, c. 2, that every pari&s;h &s;hould be bound to provide for its own poor; and that over&s;eers of the poor &s;hould be annually appointed, who, with the churchwardens, &s;hould rai&s;e by a pari&s;h rate, competent &s;ums for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>BY this &s;tatute the nece&s;&s;ity of providing for their own poor was indi&s;pen&s;ibly impo&s;ed upon every pari&s;h. Who were to be con&s;idered as the poor of each pari&s;h, therefore, became a que&s;tion of &s;ome importance. This que&s;tion, after &s;ome variation, was at la&s;t determined by the 13th and 14th of Charles II. when it was enacted that forty days undi&s;turbed re&s;idence &s;hould gain any per&s;on a &s;ettlement in any pari&s;h; but that within that time it &s;hould be lawful for two ju&s;tices of the peace, upon complaint made by the church-wardens or over&s;eers of the poor, to remove any new inhabitant to the pari&s;h where he was la&s;t legally &s;ettled; unle&s;s he either rented a tenement of ten pounds a year, or could give &s;uch &s;ecurity for the di&s;charge of the pari&s;h where he was then living, as tho&s;e ju&s;tices &s;hould judge &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>SOME frauds, it is &s;aid, were committed in con&s;equence of this &s;tatute; pari&s;h officers &s;ometimes bribing their own poor to go clande&s;tinely to another pari&s;h, and by keeping them&s;elves con|cealed for forty days to gain a &s;ettlement there, to the di&s;charge of that to which they properly belonged. It was enacted, therefore, by the 1&s;t of James II. that the forty days undi&s;turbed re&s;idence of any per&s;on nece&s;&s;ary to gain a &s;ettlement, &s;hould be accounted only from the time of his delivering notice in writing, of the place of his abode and the number of his family, to one of the church|wardens or over&s;eers of the pari&s;h where he came to dwell.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="184">
BUT pari&s;h officers, it &s;eems, were not always more hone&s;t with regard to their own, than they had been with regard to other pari&s;hes, and &s;ometimes connived at &s;uch intru&s;ions, receiving the notice, and taking no proper &s;teps in con&s;equence of it. As every per&s;on in a pari&s;h, therefore, was &s;uppo&s;ed to have an intere&s;t to prevent as much as po&s;&s;ible their being burdened by &s;uch intruders, it was further enacted by the 3d of William III, that the forty days re&s;idence &s;hould be accounted only from the publication of &s;uch notice in writing on Sunday in the church immediately after divine &s;ervice.</P>
<P><Q>AFTER all, &s;ays Doctor Burn, this kind of &s;ettlement, by continuing forty days after publication of notice in writing, is very &s;eldom obtained; and the de&s;ign of the acts is not &s;o much for gaining of &s;ettlements, as for the avoiding of them, by per&s;ons coming into a pari&s;h clande&s;tinely: for the giving of notice is only putting a force upon the pari&s;h to remove. But if a per&s;on's &s;ituation is &s;uch, that it is doubtful whether he is actually removeable or not, he &s;hall by giving of notice compel the pari&s;h either to allow him a &s;ettlement unconte&s;ted, by &s;uf|fering him to continue forty days; or, by removing him, to try the right.</Q></P>
<P>THIS &s;tatute, therefore, rendered it almo&s;t impracticable for a poor man to gain a new &s;ettlement in the old way, by forty days inhabitancy. But that it might not appear to preclude altogether the common people of one pari&s;h from ever e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves with &s;ecurity in another, it appointed four other ways by which a &s;ettlement might be gained without any notice delivered or pub|li&s;hed. The fir&s;t was, by being taxed to pari&s;h rates and paying them; the &s;econd, by being elected into an annual pari&s;h office and &s;erving in it a year; the third, by &s;erving an apprentice&s;hip in the
<PB N="172" REF="185">
pari&s;h; the fourth, by being hired into &s;ervice there for a year, and continuing in the &s;ame &s;ervice during the whole of it.</P>
<P>NOBODY can gain a &s;ettlement by either of the two fir&s;t ways, but by the publick deed of the whole pari&s;h, who are too well aware of the con&s;equences to adopt any new comer who has nothing but his labour to &s;upport him, either by taxing him to pari&s;h rates, or by electing him into a pari&s;h office.</P>
<P>No married man can well gain any &s;ettlement in either of the two la&s;t ways. An apprentice is &s;carce ever married, and it is expre&s;ly enacted, that no married &s;ervant &s;hall gain any &s;ettlement by being hired for a year. The principal effect of introducing &s;ettlement by &s;ervice, has been to put out in a great mea&s;ure the old fa&s;hion of hiring for a year, which before had been &s;o cu&s;tomary in England, that even at this day, if no particular term is agreed upon, the law intends that every &s;ervant is hired for a year. But ma&s;ters are not always willing to give their &s;ervants a &s;ettlement by hiring them in this manner; and &s;ervants are not always willing to be &s;o hired, becau&s;e as every la&s;t &s;ettlement di&s;charges all the fore|going, they might thereby lo&s;e their original &s;ettlement in the places of their nativity, the habitation of their parents and re|lations.</P>
<P>No independent workman, it is evident, whether labourer or artificer, is likely to gain any new &s;ettlement either by apprentice|&s;hip or by &s;ervice. When &s;uch a per&s;on, therefore, carried his in|du&s;try to a new pari&s;h, he was liable to be removed, how healthy and indu&s;trious &s;oever, at the caprice of any churchwarden or over&s;eer, unle&s;s he either rented a tenement of ten pounds a year, a thing impo&s;&s;ible for one who has nothing but his labour to live by; or could give &s;uch &s;ecurity for the di&s;charge of the pari&s;h as
<PB N="173" REF="186">
two ju&s;tices of the peace &s;hould judge &s;ufficient. What &s;ecurity they &s;hall require, indeed, is left altogether to their di&s;cretion; but they cannot well require le&s;s than thirty pounds, it having been enacted, that the purcha&s;e even of a freehold e&s;tate of le&s;s than thirty pounds value, &s;hall not gain any per&s;on a &s;ettlement, as not being &s;ufficient for the di&s;charge of the pari&s;h. But this is a &s;e|curity which &s;carce any man who lives by labour can give; and much greater &s;ecurity is frequently demanded.</P>
<P>IN order to re&s;tore in &s;ome mea&s;ure that free circulation of labour which tho&s;e different &s;tatutes had almo&s;t entirely taken away, the invention of certificates was fallen upon. By the 8th and 9th of William III. it was enacted, that if any per&s;on &s;hould bring a certi|ficate from the pari&s;h where he was la&s;t legally &s;ettled, &s;ub&s;cribed by the churchwardens and over&s;eers of the poor, and allowed by two ju&s;tices of the peace, that every other pari&s;h &s;hould be obliged to receive him; that he &s;hould not be removable merely upon ac|count of his being likely to become chargeable, but only upon his becoming actually chargeable, and that then the pari&s;h which granted the certificate &s;hould be obliged to pay the expence both of his maintenance and of his removal. And in order to give the mo&s;t perfect &s;ecurity to the pari&s;h where &s;uch certificated man &s;hould come to re&s;ide, it was further enacted by the &s;ame &s;tatute, that he &s;hould gain no &s;ettlement there by any means whatever, except either by renting a tenement of ten pounds a year, or by &s;erving upon his own account in an annual pari&s;h office for one whole year; and con&s;equently neither by notice, nor by &s;ervice, nor by apprentice&s;hip, nor by paying pari&s;h rates. By the 12th of Queen Anne too, &s;tat. 1. c. 18. it was further enacted, that neither the &s;ervants nor apprentices of &s;uch certificated man &s;hould gain any &s;ettlement in the pari&s;h where he re&s;ided under &s;uch cer|tificate.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="187">
How far this invention has re&s;tored that free circulation of labour which the preceeding &s;tatutes had almo&s;t entirely taken away, we may learn from the following very judicious ob&s;er|vation of Doctor Burn. <Q>It is obvious, &s;ays he, that there are divers good rea&s;ons for requiring certificates with per&s;ons com|ing to &s;ettle in any place; namely, that per&s;ons re&s;iding under them can gain no &s;ettlement, neither by apprentice&s;hip, nor by &s;ervice, nor by giving notice, nor by paying pari&s;h rates; that they can &s;ettle neither apprentices nor &s;ervants; that if they become chargeable, it is certainly known whither to remove them, and the pari&s;h &s;hall be paid for the removal, and for their maintenance in the mean time; and that if they fall &s;ick, and cannot be removed, the pari&s;h which gave the certificate mu&s;t maintain them: None of all which can be without a cer|tificate. Which rea&s;ons will hold proportionably for pari&s;hes not granting certificates in ordinary ca&s;es; for it is far more than an equal chance, but that they will have the certificated per&s;ons again, and in a wor&s;e condition.</Q> The moral of this ob&s;ervation &s;eems to be, that certificates ought always to be re|quired by the pari&s;h where any poor man comes to re&s;ide, and that they ought very &s;eldom to be granted by that which he pro|po&s;es to leave. <Q>There is &s;omewhat of hard&s;hip in this matter of certificates,</Q> &s;ays the &s;ame very intelligent author in his Hi&s;tory of the poor laws, <Q>by putting it in the power of a pari&s;h officer, to impri&s;on a man as it were for life; however incon|venient it may be for him to continue at that place where he has had the misfortune to acquire what is called a &s;ettlement, or whatever advantage he may propo&s;e to him&s;elf by living el&s;e|where.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH a certificate carries along with it no te&s;timonial of good behaviour, and certifies nothing but that the per&s;on belongs
<PB N="175" REF="188">
to the pari&s;h to which he really does belong, it is altogether di&s;|cretionary in the pari&s;h officers either to grant or to refu&s;e it. A mandamus was once moved for, &s;ays Doctor Burn, to compel the churchwardens and over&s;eers to &s;ign a certificate; but the court of King's Bench rejected the motion as a very &s;trange attempt.</P>
<P>THE very unequal price of labour which we frequently find in England in places at no great di&s;tance from one another, is pro|bably owing to the ob&s;truction which the law of &s;ettlements gives to a poor man who would carry his indu&s;try from one pari&s;h to another without a certificate. A &s;ingle man, indeed, who is healthy and indu&s;trious, may &s;ometimes re&s;ide by &s;ufferance without one; but a man with a wife and family who &s;hould attempt to do &s;o, would in mo&s;t pari&s;hes be &s;ure of being removed, and if the &s;ingle man &s;hould afterwards marry, he would generally be removed likewi&s;e. The &s;carcity of hands in one pari&s;h, therefore, cannot always be relieved by their &s;uper-abundance in another, as it is con&s;tantly in Scotland, and, I believe, in all other countries where there is no difficulty of &s;ettlement. In &s;uch countries, though wages may &s;ometimes ri&s;e a little in the neighbourhood of a great town, or wherever el&s;e there is an extraordinary demand for la|bour, and &s;ink gradually as the di&s;tance from &s;uch places increa&s;es, till they fall back to the common rate of the country; yet we never meet with tho&s;e &s;udden and unaccountable differences in the wages of neighbouring places which we &s;ometimes find in England, where it is often more difficult for a poor man to pa&s;s the artificial boun|dary of a pari&s;h, than an arm of the &s;ea or a ridge of high mountains, natural boundaries which &s;ometimes &s;eparate very di|&s;tinctly different rates of wages in other countries.</P>
<P>To remove a man who has committed no mi&s;demeanour from the pari&s;h where he chu&s;es to re&s;ide, is an evident violation of na|tural
<PB N="176" REF="189">
liberty and ju&s;tice. The common people of England, how|ever, &s;o jealous of their liberty, but like the common people of mo&s;t other countries never rightly under&s;tanding wherein it con|&s;i&s;ts, have now for more than a century together &s;uffered them|&s;elves to be expo&s;ed to this oppre&s;&s;ion without a remedy. Though men of reflection too have &s;ometimes complained of the law of &s;ettlements as a publick grievance; yet it has never been the object of any general popular clamour, &s;uch as that again&s;t general warrants, an abu&s;ive practice undoubtedly, but &s;uch a one as was not likely to occa&s;ion any general oppre&s;&s;ion. There is &s;carce a poor man in England of forty years of age, I will venture to &s;ay, who has not in &s;ome part of his life felt him&s;elf mo&s;t cruelly oppre&s;t by this ill contrived law of &s;ettle|ments.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this long chapter with ob&s;erving, that though anciently it was u&s;ual to rate wages, fir&s;t by general laws extending over the whole kingdom, and afterwards by particular orders of the ju&s;tices of peace in every particular country, both the&s;e prac|tices have now gone intirely into di&s;u&s;e. <Q>By the experience of above four hundred years, &s;ays Doctor Burn, it &s;eems time to lay a&s;ide all endeavours to bring under &s;trict regulations, what in its own nature &s;eems incapable of minute limitation: for if all per&s;ons in the &s;ame kind of work were to receive equal wages, there would be no emulation, and no room left for in|du&s;try or ingenuity.</Q></P>
<P>PARTICULAR acts of parliament, however, &s;till attempt &s;ome|times to regulate wages in particular trades and in particular places. Thus the 8th of George III. prohibits under heavy penalties all ma&s;ter taylors in London, and five miles round it, from giving, and their workmen from accepting, more than two &s;hillings and
<PB N="177" REF="190">
&s;even-pence halfpenny a day, except in the ca&s;e of a general mourn|ing. Whenever the legi&s;lature attempts to regulate the differences between ma&s;ters and their workmen, its coun&s;ellors are always the ma&s;ters. When the regulation, therefore, is in favour of the workmen, it is always ju&s;t and equitable; but it is &s;ometimes other|wi&s;e when in favour of the ma&s;ters. Thus the law which obliges the ma&s;ters in &s;everal different trades to pay their workmen in mo|ney and not in goods, is quite ju&s;t and equitable. It impo&s;es no real hard&s;hip upon the ma&s;ters. It only obliges them to pay that value in money, which they pretended to pay, but did not always really pay, in goods. This law is in favour of the workmen; but the 8th of George III. is in favour of the ma&s;ters. When ma&s;ters combine together in order to reduce the wages of their workmen, they commonly enter into a private bond or agreement, not to give more than a certain wage under a certain penalty. Were the workmen to enter into a contrary combination of the &s;ame kind, not to accept of a certain wage under a certain penalty, the law would puni&s;h them very &s;everely; and if it dealt impartially it would treat the ma&s;ters in the &s;ame manner. But the 8th of George III. enforces by law that very regulation which ma&s;ters &s;ometimes attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h by &s;uch combinations. The com|plaint of the workmen, that it puts the able&s;t and mo&s;t indu|&s;trious upon the &s;ame footing with an ordinary workman, &s;eems perfectly well founded.</P>
<P>IN antient times too it was u&s;ual to attempt to regulate the profits of merchants and other dealers, by rating the price both of provi&s;ions and other goods. The a&s;&s;ize of bread is, &s;o far as I know, the only remnant of this ancient u&s;age. Where there is an exclu&s;ive corporation, it may perhaps be proper to regulate the price of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary of life. But where there is none, the competition will regulate it much better than any a&s;&s;ize. The
<PB N="178" REF="191">
method of fixing the a&s;&s;ize of bread e&s;tabli&s;hed by the 31&s;t of George II. could not be put in practice in Scotland, on account of a defect in the law; its execution depending upon the office of clerk of the market, which does not exi&s;t there. This defect was not remedied till the 3d of George III. The want of an a&s;&s;ize oc|ca&s;ioned no &s;en&s;ible inconveniency, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of one, in the few places where it has yet taken place, has produced no &s;en&s;ible advantage. In the greater part of the towns of Scotland, however, there is an incorporation of bakers who claim exclu&s;ive privileges, though they are not very &s;trictly guarded.</P>
<P>THE proportion between the different rates both of wages and profit in the different employments of labour and &s;tock, &s;eems not to be much affected, as has already been ob&s;erved, by the riches or poverty, the advancing, &s;tationary, or declining &s;tate of the &s;ociety. Such revolutions in the publick welfare, though they affect the general rates both of wages and profit, mu&s;t in the end affect them equally in all different employments. The proportion between them, therefore, mu&s;t remain the &s;ame, and cannot well be altered, at lea&s;t for any con&s;iderable time, by any &s;uch revolutions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>Of the Rent of Land.</HI></HEAD>
<P>RENT, con&s;idered as the price paid for the u&s;e of land, is naturally the highe&s;t which the tenant can afford to pay in the actual circum&s;tances of the land. In adju&s;ting the terms of the lea&s;e, the landlord endeavours to leave him no greater &s;hare of the produce than what is &s;ufficient to keep up the &s;tock from which he furni&s;hes the &s;eed, pays the labour, and purcha&s;es and main|tains the cattle and other in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry, together with the ordinary profits of farming &s;tock in the neighbourhood. This is evidently the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare with which the tenant can content him&s;elf without being a lo&s;er, and the landlord &s;eldom means to leave him any more. Whatever part of the produce, or, what is the &s;ame thing, whatever part of its price, is over and above this &s;hare, he naturally endeavours to re&s;erve to him&s;elf as the rent of his land, which is evidently the highe&s;t the tenant can afford to pay in the actual circum&s;tances of the land. Sometimes, indeed, the liberality, more frequently the ignorance, of the landlord, makes him accept of &s;omewhat le&s;s than this portion; and &s;ometimes too, though more rarely, the ignorance of the tenant makes him undertake to pay &s;omewhat more, or to content him&s;elf with &s;omewhat le&s;s than the ordinary profits of farming &s;tock in the neighbourhood. This portion, however, may &s;till be con&s;idered as the natural rent of land, or the rent for which it is naturally meant that land &s;hould for the mo&s;t part be lett.</P>
<P>THE rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a rea&s;onable profit or intere&s;t for the &s;tock laid out by the land|lord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the ca&s;e upon &s;ome occa&s;ions; for it can &s;carce ever be more than partly
<PB N="180" REF="193">
the ca&s;e. The landlord demands a rent even for unimproved land, and the &s;uppo&s;ed intere&s;t or profit upon the expence of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent. Tho&s;e improvements, be&s;ides, are not always made by the &s;tock of the landlord, but &s;ome|times by that of the tenant. When the lea&s;e comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the &s;ame augmentation of rent, as if they had been all made by his own.</P>
<P>HE &s;ometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement. Kelp is a &s;pecies of &s;ea-weed, which, when burnt, yields an alkaline &s;alt, u&s;eful for making gla&s;s, &s;oap, and for &s;everal other purpo&s;es. It grows in &s;everal parts of Great Britain, particularly in Scotland, upon &s;uch rocks only as lie within the high water mark, which are twice every day covered with the &s;ea, and of which the produce, therefore, was never augmented by human indu&s;try. The landlord, however, who&s;e e&s;tate is bounded by a kelp &s;hore of this kind, demands a rent for it as much as for his corn fields.</P>
<P>THE &s;ea in the neighbourhood of the i&s;lands of Shetland is more than commonly abundant in fi&s;h, which make a great part of the &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence of their inhabitants. But in order to profit by the produce of the water, they mu&s;t have a habitation upon the neighbouring land. The rent of the landlord is in proportion, not to what the farmer can make by the land, but to what he can make both by the land and the water. It is partly paid in &s;ea fi&s;h; and one of the very few in&s;tances in which rent makes a part of the price-of that com|modity, is to be found in that country.</P>
<P>THE rent of land, therefore, con&s;idered as the price paid for the u&s;e of the land, is naturally a monopoly price. It is not at all proportioned to what the landlord may have laid out upon the
<PB N="181" REF="194">
improvement of the land, or to what he can afford to take; but to what the farmer can afford to give.</P>
<P>SUCH parts only of the produce of land can commonly be brought to market of which the ordinary price is &s;ufficient to replace the &s;tock which mu&s;t be employed in bringing them thither, together with its ordinary profits. If the ordinary price is more than this, the &s;urplus part of it will naturally go to the rent of the land. If it is not more, though the commodity may be brought to market, it can afford no rent to the landlord. Whether the price is, or is not more, depends upon the demand.</P>
<P>THERE, are &s;ome parts of the produce of land for which the demand mu&s;t always be &s;uch as to afford a greater price than what is &s;ufficient to bring them to market; and there are others for which it either may or may not be &s;uch as to afford this greater price. The former mu&s;t always afford a rent to the landlord. The latter &s;ometimes may, and &s;ometimes may not, according to different circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>RENT, it is to be ob&s;erved, therefore, enters into the compo|&s;ition of the price of commodities in a different way from wages and profit. High or low wages and profit, are the cau&s;es of high or low price; high or low rent is the effect of it. It is becau&s;e high or low wages and profit mu&s;t be paid, in order to bring a particular commodity to market, that its price is high or low. But it is be|cau&s;e its price is high or low; a great deal more, or very little more, or no more, than what is &s;ufficient to pay tho&s;e wages and profit, that it affords a high rent, or a low rent, or no rent at all.</P>
<P>THE particular con&s;ideration, fir&s;t, of tho&s;e parts of the produce of land which always afford &s;ome rent; &s;econdly, of tho&s;e which
<PB N="182" REF="195">
&s;ometimes may and &s;ometimes may not afford rent; and, thirdly, of the variations which, in the different periods of improvement, naturally take place, in the relative value of tho&s;e two different &s;orts of rude produce, when compared both with one another, and with manufactured commodities, will divide this chapter into three parts.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I. <HI>Of the Produce of Land which always affords Rent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS men, like all other animals, naturally multiply in proportion to the means of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, food is always, more or le&s;s, in demand. It can always purcha&s;e or command a greater or &s;maller quantity of labour, and &s;omebody can always be found who is willing to do &s;omething in order to obtain it. The quantity of labour, indeed, which it can purcha&s;e, is not always equal to what it could maintain, if managed in the mo&s;t oeconomical manner, on account of the high wages which are &s;ometimes given to labour. But it can always purcha&s;e &s;uch a quantity of labour as it can maintain, according to the rate at which that &s;ort of labour is com|monly maintained in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>BUT land, in almo&s;t any &s;ituation, produces a greater quantity of food than what is &s;ufficient to maintain all the labour nece&s;&s;ary for bringing it to market, in the mo&s;t liberal way in which that labour is ever maintained. The &s;urplus too is always more than &s;ufficient to replace the &s;tock which employed that labour, together with its profits. Something, therefore, always remains for a rent to the landlord.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t de&s;art moors in Norway and Scotland produce &s;ome &s;ort of pa&s;ture for cattle, of which the milk and the increa&s;e are
<PB N="183" REF="196">
always more than &s;ufficient, not only to maintain all the labour nece&s;&s;ary for tending them, and to pay the ordinary profit to the farmer or owner of the herd or flock; but to afford &s;ome &s;mall rent to the landlord. The rent increa&s;es in proportion to the good|ne&s;s of the pa&s;ture. The &s;ame extent of ground not only main|tains a greater number of cattle, but as they are brought within a &s;maller compa&s;s, le&s;s labour becomes requi&s;ite to tend them, and to collect their produce. The landlord gains both ways; by the in|crea&s;e of the produce, and by the diminution of the labour which mu&s;t be maintained out of it.</P>
<P>THE rent of land varies with its fertility, whatever be its pro|duce, and with its &s;ituation, whatever be its fertility. Land in the neighbourhood of a town, gives a greater rent than land equally fertile in a di&s;tant part of the country. Though it may co&s;t no more labour to cultivate the one than the other, it mu&s;t always co&s;t more to bring the produce of the di&s;tant land to market. A greater quantity of labour, therefore, mu&s;t be maintained out of it; and the &s;urplus, from which are drawn both the profit of the farmer and the rent of the landlord, mu&s;t be dimini&s;hed. But in remote parts of the country the rate of profit, as has already been &s;hown, is generally higher than in the neighbourhood of a large town. A &s;maller proportion of this dimini&s;hed &s;urplus, therefore, mu&s;t be|long to the landlord.</P>
<P>GOOD roads, canals, and navigable rivers, by dimini&s;hing the expence of carriage, put the remote parts of the country more nearly upon a level with tho&s;e in the neighbourhood of the town. They are upon that account the greate&s;t of all improvements. They encourage the cultivation of the remote, which mu&s;t always be the mo&s;t exten&s;ive circle of the country. They are advantageous to the town, by breaking down the monopoly of the country in its
<PB N="184" REF="197">
neighbourhood. They are advantageous even to that part of the country. Though they introduce &s;ome rival commodities into the old market, they open many new markets to its produce. Mono|poly, be&s;ides, is a great enemy to good management, which can never be univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed but in con&s;equence of that free and univer&s;al competition which forces every body to have recour&s;e to it for the &s;ake of &s;elf-defence. It is not more than fifty years ago that &s;ome of the counties in the neighbourhood of London, peti|tioned the parliament again&s;t the exten&s;ion of the turnpike roads into the remoter counties. Tho&s;e remoter counties, they pre|tended, from the cheapne&s;s of labour, would be able to &s;ell their gra&s;s and corn cheaper in the London market than them&s;elves, and would thereby reduce their rents and ruin their cultivation. Their rents, however, have ri&s;en, and their cultivation has been improved &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>A CORN field of moderate fertility produces a much greater quantity of food for man, than the be&s;t pa&s;ture of equal extent. Though its cultivation requires much more labour, yet the &s;urplus which remains after replacing the &s;eed and maintaining all that labour, is likewi&s;e much greater. If a pound of butcher's meat, therefore, was never &s;uppo&s;ed to be worth more than a pound of bread, this greater &s;urplus would every where be of greater value, and con&s;titute a greater fund both for the profit of the farmer and the rent of the landlord. It &s;eems to have done &s;o univer&s;ally in the rude beginnings of agriculture.</P>
<P>BUT the relative values of tho&s;e two different &s;pecies of food, bread and butcher's-meat, are very different in the different periods of agriculture. In its rude beginnings, the unimproved wilds, which then occupy the far greater part of the country, are all abandoned to cattle. There is more butcher's-meat than bread,

and bread, therefore, is the food for which there is the greate&s;t competition, and which con&s;equently brings the greate&s;t price. At Buenos Ayres, we are told by Ulloa, four reals, one and twenty pence halfpenny &s;terling, was, forty or fifty years ago, the ordinary price of an ox, cho&s;en from a herd of two or three hun|dred. He &s;ays nothing of the price of bread, probably becau&s;e he found nothing remarkable about it. An ox there, he &s;ays, co&s;ts little more than the labour of catching him. But corn can no where be rai&s;ed without a great deal of labour, and in a country which lies upon the river Plate, at that time the direct road from Europe to the &s;ilver mines of Poto&s;i, the money price of labour could not be very cheap. It is otherwi&s;e when cultivation is ex|tended over the greater part of the country. There is then more bread than butcher's-meat. The competition changes its direction, and the price of butcher's-meat becomes greater than the price of bread.</P>
<P>BY the exten&s;ion be&s;ides of cultivation, the unimproved wilds become in&s;ufficient to &s;upply the demand for butcher's-meat. A great part of the cultivated lands mu&s;t be employed in rearing and fattening cattle, of which the price, therefore, mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to pay, not only the labour nece&s;&s;ary for tending them, but the rent which the landlord and the profit which the farmer could have drawn from &s;uch land employed in tillage. The cattle bred upon the mo&s;t uncultivated moors, when brought to the &s;ame market, are, in proportion to their weight or goodne&s;s, &s;old at the &s;ame price as tho&s;e which are reared upon the mo&s;t improved land. The proprietors of tho&s;e moors profit by it, and rai&s;e the rent of their land in proportion to the price of their cattle. It is not more than a century ago that in many parts of the highlands of Scotland, butcher's-meat was as cheap or cheaper than even bread made of oatmeal. The union opened the market of England to the high|land
<PB N="186" REF="199">
cattle. Their ordinary price is at pre&s;ent about three times greater than at the beginning of the century, and the rents of many highland e&s;tates have been tripled and quadrupled in the &s;ame time. In almo&s;t every part of Great Britain a pound of the be&s;t butcher's-meat is, in the pre&s;ent times, generally worth more than two pounds of the be&s;t white bread; and in plentiful years it is &s;ome|times worth three or four pounds.</P>
<P>IT is thus that in the progre&s;s of improvement the rent and profit of unimproved pa&s;ture come to be regulated in &s;ome mea&s;ure by the rent and profit of what is improved, and the&s;e again by the rent and profit of corn. Corn is an annual crop. Butcher's-meat, a crop which requires four or five years to grow. As an acre of land, therefore, will produce a much &s;maller quantity of the one &s;pecies of food than of the other, the inferiority of the quantity mu&s;t be compen&s;ated by the &s;uperiority of the price. If it was more than compen&s;ated, more corn land would be turned into pa&s;ture; and if it was not compen&s;ated, part of what was in pa&s;ture would be brought back into corn.</P>
<P>THIS equality, however, between the rent and profit of gra&s;s and tho&s;e of corn; of the land of which the immediate produce is food for cattle, and of that of which the immediate produce is food for men; mu&s;t be under&s;tood to take place only through the greater part of the improved lands of a great country. In &s;ome par|ticular local &s;ituations it is quite otherwi&s;e, and the rent and profit of gra&s;s are much &s;uperior to what can be made by corn.</P>
<P>THUS in the neighbourhood of a great town, the demand for milk and for forage to hor&s;es, frequently contribute, along with the high price of butcher's-meat, to rai&s;e the value of gra&s;s above what may be called its natural proportion to that of corn. This
<PB N="187" REF="200">
local advantage, it is evident, cannot be communicated to the lands at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>PARTICULAR circum&s;tances have &s;ometimes rendered &s;ome countries &s;o populous, that the whole territory, like the lands in the neighbourhood of a great town, has not been &s;ufficient to produce both the gra&s;s and the corn nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of their inhabitants. Their lands, therefore, have been principally em|ployed in the production of gra&s;s, the more bulky commodity, and which cannot be &s;o ea&s;ily brought from a great di&s;tance; and corn, the food of the great body of the people, has been chiefly imported from foreign countries. Holland is at pre&s;ent in this &s;ituation, and a con&s;iderable part of antient Italy &s;eems to have been &s;o during the pro&s;perity of the Romans. To feed well, old Cato &s;aid, as we are told by Cicero, was the fir&s;t and mo&s;t profitable thing in the management of a private e&s;tate; to feed tolerably well, the &s;econd; and to feed ill, the third. To plough, he ranked only in the fourth place of profit and advantage. Tillage, indeed, in that part of antient Italy which lay in the neighbourhood of Rome, mu&s;t have been very much di&s;couraged by the di&s;tributions of corn which were fre|quently made to the people, either gratuitou&s;ly, or at a very low price. This corn was brought from the conquered provinces, of which &s;everal, in&s;tead of taxes, were obliged to furni&s;h a tenth part of their produce at a &s;tated price, about &s;ixpence a peck, to the republick. The low price at which this corn was di&s;tributed to the people, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have &s;unk the price of what could be brought to the Roman market from Latium, or the antient territory of Rome, and mu&s;t have di&s;couraged its cultivation in that country.</P>
<P>IN an open country too, of which the principal produce is corn, a well enclo&s;ed piece of gra&s;s will frequently rent higher than any
<PB N="188" REF="201">
corn field in its neighbourhood. It is convenient for the mainte|nance of the cattle employed in the cultivation of the corn, and its high rent is, in this ca&s;e, not &s;o properly paid from the value of its own produce, as from that of the corn lands which are culti|vated by means of it. It is likely to fall, if ever the neighbouring lands are compleatly enclo&s;ed. The pre&s;ent high rent of enclo&s;ed land in Scotland &s;eems owing to the &s;carcity of enclo&s;ure, and will probably la&s;t no longer than that &s;carcity. The advantage of en|clo&s;ure is greater for pa&s;ture than for corn. It &s;aves the labour of guarding the cattle, which feed better too when they are not liable to be di&s;turbed by their keeper or his dog.</P>
<P>BUT where there is no local advantage of this kind, the rent and profit of corn, or whatever el&s;e is the common vegetable food of the people, mu&s;t naturally regulate, upon the land which is fit for producing it, the rent and profit of pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>THE u&s;e of the artificial gra&s;&s;es, of turnips, carrots, cabbages, and the other expedients which have been fallen upon to make an equal quantity of land feed a greater number of cattle than when in natural gra&s;s, &s;hould &s;omewhat reduce, it might be expected, the &s;uperiority which, in an improved country, the price of butcher's-meat naturally has over that of bread. It &s;eems ac|cordingly to have done &s;o; and there is &s;ome rea&s;on for believing that, at lea&s;t in the London market, the price of butcher's meat in proportion to the price of bread is a good deal lower in the pre&s;ent times than it was in the beginning of the la&s;t cen|tury.</P>
<P>IN the appendix to the Life of prince Henry, Doctor Birch has given us an account of the prices of butcher's meat as com|monly paid by that prince. It is there &s;aid, that the four quarters
<PB N="189" REF="202">
of an ox weighing &s;ix hundred pounds u&s;ually co&s;t him nine pounds ten &s;hillings or thereabouts; that is, thirty-one &s;hillings and eight pence per hundred pounds weight. Prince Henry died on the 6th of November, 1612, in the nineteenth year of his age.</P>
<P>IN March, 1764, there was a parliamentary enquiry into the cau&s;es of the high price of provi&s;ions at that time. It was then, among other proof to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, given in evidence by a Virginia merchant, that in March, 1763, he had victualled his &s;hips for twenty-four or twenty-five &s;hillings the hundred weight of beef, which he con&s;idered as the ordinary price; whereas, in that dear year he had paid twenty-&s;even &s;hillings for the &s;ame weight and &s;ort. This high price in 1764, is, however, four &s;hillings and eight-pence cheaper than the ordinary price paid by prince Henry; and it is the be&s;t beef only, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, which is fit to be &s;alted for tho&s;e di&s;tant voyages.</P>
<P>THE price paid by prince Henry amounts to 3&frac45;<HI>d.</HI> per pound weight of the whole carca&s;e, coar&s;e and choice pieces taken toge|ther; and at that rate the choice pieces could not have been &s;old by retail for le&s;s than 4&frac12;<HI>d.</HI> or 5<HI>d.</HI> the pound.</P>
<P>IN the parliamentary enquiry in 1764, the witne&s;&s;es &s;tated the price of the choice pieces of the be&s;t beef to be to the con&s;umer 4<HI>d.</HI> and 4&frac14;<HI>d.</HI> the pound; and the coar&s;e pieces in general to be from &s;even farthings to 2&frac12;<HI>d.</HI> and 2&frac34;<HI>d.</HI>; and this they &s;aid was in general one half-penny dearer than the &s;ame &s;ort of pieces had u&s;ually been &s;old in the month of March. But even this high price is &s;till a good deal cheaper than what we can well &s;up|po&s;e, the ordinary retail price to have been in the time of prince Henry.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="203">
DURING the twelve fir&s;t years of the la&s;t century, the average price of the be&s;t wheat at the Wind&s;or market was 1<HI>l.</HI> 18<HI>s.</HI> 3&frac16;<HI>d.</HI> the quarter of nine Winche&s;ter bu&s;hels.</P>
<P>BUT in the twelve years preceeding 1764, including that year, the average price of the &s;ame mea&s;ure of the be&s;t wheat at the &s;ame market was 2<HI>l.</HI> 1<HI>s.</HI> 9&frac12;<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>IN the twelve fir&s;t years of the la&s;t century, therefore, wheat appears to have been a good deal cheaper, and butchers meat a good deal dearer than in the twelve years preceeding 1764, in|cluding that year.</P>
<P>IN all great countries the greater part of the cultivated lands are employed in producing either food for men or food for cattle. The rent and profit of the&s;e regulate the rent and profit of all other cultivated land. If any particular produce afforded le&s;s, the land would &s;oon be turned into corn or pa&s;ture; and if any afforded more, &s;ome part of the lands in corn or pa&s;ture would &s;oon be turned to that produce.</P>
<P>THOSE productions, indeed, which require either a greater original expence of improvement, or a greater annual expence of cultivation, in order to fit the land for them, appear commonly to afford, the one a greater rent, the other a greater profit than corn or pa&s;ture. This &s;uperiority, however, will &s;eldom be found to amount to more than a rea&s;onable intere&s;t or compen&s;ation for this &s;uperior expence.</P>
<P>IN a hop garden, a fruit garden, a kitchen garden, both the rent of the landlord, and the profit of the farmer, are generally greater than in a corn or gra&s;s field. But to bring the ground into
<PB N="191" REF="204">
this condition requires more expence. Hence a greater rent be|comes due to the landlord. It requires too a more attentive and &s;kilful management. Hence a greater profit becomes due to the farmer. The crop too, at lea&s;t in the hop and fruit garden, is more precarious. Its price, therefore, be&s;ides compen&s;ating all occa&s;ional lo&s;&s;es, mu&s;t afford &s;omething like the profit of in&s;u|rance. The circum&s;tances of gardeners, generally mean, and always moderate, may &s;atisfy us that their great ingenuity is not commonly over-recompen&s;ed. Their delightful art is practi&s;ed by &s;o many rich people for amu&s;ement, that little advantage is to be made by tho&s;e who practi&s;e it for profit; becau&s;e the per&s;ons who &s;hould naturally be their be&s;t cu&s;tomers, &s;upply them&s;elves with all their mo&s;t precious productions.</P>
<P>THE advantage which the landlord derives from &s;uch improve|ments &s;eems at no time to have been greater than what was &s;uf|ficient to compen&s;ate the original expence of making them. In the antient hu&s;bandry, after the vineyard, a well watered kitchen garden &s;eems to have been the part of the farm which was &s;up|po&s;ed to yield the mo&s;t valuable produce. But Democritus, who wrote upon hu&s;bandry about two thou&s;and years ago, and who was regarded by the antients as one of the fathers of the art, thought they did not act wi&s;ely who enclo&s;ed a kitchen garden. The profit, he &s;aid, would not compen&s;ate the expence of a &s;tone wall; and bricks (he meant, I &s;uppo&s;e, bricks baked in the &s;un) mouldered with the rain, and the winter &s;torm, and required continual repairs. Columella, who reports this judgement of Democritus, does not controvert it, but propo&s;es a very frugal method of enclo&s;ing with a hedge of thorns and briars, which, he &s;ays, he had found by experience to be both a la&s;ting and an impenetrable fence; but which, it &s;eems, was not commonly known in the time of Democritus. Palladius adopts the opinion of
<PB N="192" REF="205">
Columella, which had before been recommended by Varro. In the judgement of tho&s;e antient improvers, the produce of a kitchen garden had, it &s;eems, been little more than &s;ufficient to pay the extraordinary culture and the expence of watering; for in countries &s;o near the &s;un, it was thought proper, in tho&s;e times as in the pre&s;ent, to have the command of a &s;tream of water, which could be conducted to every bed in the garden. Through the greater part of Europe, a kitchen garden is not at pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;erve a better enclo&s;ure than that recommended by Columella. In Great Britain, and &s;ome other northern countries, the finer fruits cannot be brought to perfection but by the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of a wall. Their price, therefore, in &s;uch countries mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to pay the expence of building and maintaining what they cannot be had without. The fruit-wall frequently &s;urrounds the kitchen garden, which thus enjoys the benefit of an inclo&s;ure which its own produce could &s;eldom pay for.</P>
<P>THAT the vineyard, when properly planted and brought to perfection, was the mo&s;t valuable part of the farm, &s;eems to have been an undoubted maxim in the antient agriculture, as it is in the modern through all the wine countries. But whether it was advantageous to plant a new vineyard, was a matter of di&s;pute among the antient Italian hu&s;bandmen, as we learn from Colu|mella. He decides, like a true lover of all curious cultivation, in favour of the vineyard, and endeavours to &s;how, by a com|pari&s;on of the profit and expence, that it was a mo&s;t advantageous improvement. Such compari&s;ons, however, between the profit and expence of new projects, are commonly very fallacious; and in nothing more &s;o than in agriculture. Had the gain actually made by &s;uch plantations been commonly as great as he imagined it might have been, there could have been no di&s;pute about it. The &s;ame point is frequently at this day a matter of controver&s;y
<PB N="193" REF="206">
in the wine countries. Their writers on agriculture, indeed, the lovers and promoters of high cultivation, &s;eem generally di&s;po&s;ed to decide with Columella in favour of the vineyard. In France the anxiety of the proprietors of the old vineyards to prevent the planting of any new ones, &s;eems to favour their opinion, and to indicate a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in tho&s;e who mu&s;t have the experience, that this &s;pecies of cultivation is at pre&s;ent in that country more profitable than any other. It &s;eems at the &s;ame time, how|ever, to indicate another opinion, that this &s;uperior profit can la&s;t no longer than the laws which at pre&s;ent re&s;train the free cultivation of the vine. In 1731, they obtained an order of council prohibiting both the planting of new vineyards, and the renewal of tho&s;e old ones of which the cultivation had been in|terrupted for two years; without a particular permi&s;&s;ion from the king, to be granted only in con&s;equence of an information from the intendant of the province, certifying that he had exa|mined the land, and that it was incapable of any other culture. The pretence of this order was the &s;carcity of corn and pa&s;ture, and the &s;uper-abundance of wine. But had this &s;uper-abundance been real, it would, without any order of council, have effectually prevented the plantation of new vineyards, by reducing the profits of this &s;pecies of cultivation below their natural proportion to tho&s;e of corn and pa&s;ture. With regard to the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;carcity of corn occa&s;ioned by the multiplication of vineyards, corn is no where in France more carefully cultivated than in the wine provinces, where the land is fit for producing it; as in Burgundy, Guienne, and the Upper Languedoc. The numerous hands employed in the one &s;pecies of cultivation nece&s;&s;arily encourage the other, by affording a ready market for its produce. To dimini&s;h the number of tho&s;e who are capable of paying for it, is &s;urely a mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing expedient for encouraging the cultivation of corn. It is like the
<PB N="194" REF="207">
policy which would promote agriculture by di&s;couraging manu|factures.</P>
<P>THE rent and profit of tho&s;e productions, therefore, which require either a greater original expence of improvement in order to fit the land for them, or a greater annual expence of culti|vation, though often much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of corn and pa&s;ture, yet when they do no more than compen&s;ate &s;uch extraordinary expence, are in reality regulated by the rent and profit of tho&s;e common crops.</P>
<P>IT &s;ometimes happens, indeed, that the quantity of land which can be fitted for &s;ome particular produce, is too &s;mall to &s;upply the effectual demand. The whole produce can be di&s;|po&s;ed of to tho&s;e who are willing to give &s;omewhat more than what is &s;ufficient to pay the whole rent, wages, and profit ne|ce&s;&s;ary for rai&s;ing and bringing it to market, according to their natural rates, or according to the rates at which they are paid in the greater part of other cultivated land. The &s;urplus part of the price which remains after defraying the whole expence of improvement and cultivation may commonly, in this ca&s;e, and in this ca&s;e only, bear no regular proportion to the like &s;urplus in corn or pa&s;ture, but may exceed it in almo&s;t any degree; and the greater part of this exce&s;s naturally goes to the rent of the landlord.</P>
<P>THE u&s;ual and natural proportion, for example, between the rent and profit of wine and tho&s;e of corn and pa&s;ture, mu&s;t be under&s;tood to take place only with regard to tho&s;e vineyards which produce nothing but good common wine, &s;uch as can be rai&s;ed almo&s;t any where upon any light, gravelly, or &s;andy &s;oil, and which has nothing to recommend it but its &s;trength and whole&s;om|ne&s;s.
<PB N="195" REF="208">
It is with &s;uch vineyards only that the common land of the country can be brought into competition; for with tho&s;e of a peculiar quality it is evident that it cannot.</P>
<P>THE vine is more affected by the difference of &s;oils than any other fruit tree. From &s;ome it derives a flavour which no culture or management can equal, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, upon any other. This flavour, real or imaginary, is &s;ometimes peculiar to the produce of a few vineyards; &s;ometimes it extends through the greater part of a &s;mall di&s;trict, and &s;ometimes through a con&s;iderable part of a large province. The whole quantity of &s;uch wines that is brought to market falls &s;hort of the effectual demand, or the demand of tho&s;e who would be willing to pay the whole rent, profit, and wages nece&s;&s;ary for preparing and bringing them thither, according to the ordinary rate, or according to the rate at which they are paid in common vineyards. The whole quantity, therefore, can be di&s;po&s;ed of to tho&s;e who are willing to pay more, which nece&s;|&s;arily rai&s;es their price above that of common wine. The difference is greater or le&s;s according as the fa&s;hionablene&s;s and &s;carcity of the wine render the competition of the buyers more or le&s;s eager. Whatever it be, the greater part of it goes to the rent of the land|lord. For though &s;uch vineyards are in general more carefully cultivated than mo&s;t others, the high price of the wine &s;eems to be, not &s;o much the effect, as the cau&s;e of this careful cultivation. In &s;o valuable a produce the lo&s;s occa&s;ioned by negligence is &s;o great as to force even the mo&s;t carele&s;s to attention. A &s;mall part of this high price, therefore, is &s;ufficient to pay the wages of the extraordinary labour be&s;towed upon their cultivation, and the profits of the extraordinary &s;tock which puts that labour into motion.</P>
<P>THE &s;ugar colonies po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the European nations in the We&s;t Indies, may be compared to tho&s;e precious vineyards. Their
<PB N="196" REF="209">
whole produce falls &s;hort of the effectual demand of Europe, and can be di&s;po&s;ed of to tho&s;e who are willing to give more than what is &s;ufficient to pay the whole rent, profit, and wages nece&s;&s;ary for preparing and bringing it to market, according to the rate at which they are commonly paid by any other produce. In Cochin-china the fine&s;t white &s;ugar commonly &s;ells for three pia&s;tres the quintal, about thirteen &s;hillings and &s;ixpence of our money, as we are told by Mr. Poivre, a very careful ob&s;erver of the agriculture of that country. What is there called the quintal weighs from a hundred and fifty to two hundred Paris pounds, or a hundred and &s;eventy-five Paris pounds at a medium, which reduces the price of the hundred weight Engli&s;h to about eight &s;hillings &s;terling, not a fourth part of what is commonly paid for the brown or mu&s;kavada &s;ugars imported from our colonies, and not a &s;ixth part of what is paid for the fine&s;t white &s;ugar. The greater part of the culti|vated lands in Cochin-china are employed in producing corn and rice, the food of the great body of the people. The re&s;pective prices of corn, rice, and &s;ugar, are there probably in the natural proportion, or in that which naturally takes place in the different crops of the greater part of cultivated land, and which recompences the landlord and farmer, as nearly as can be computed, according to what is u&s;ually the original expence of improvement and the annual expence of cultivation. But in our &s;ugar colonies the price of &s;ugar bears no &s;uch proportion to that of the produce of a rice or corn field either in Europe or in America. It is commonly &s;aid that a &s;ugar planter expects that the rum and the mola&s;&s;es &s;hould defray the whole expence of his cultivation, and that his &s;ugar &s;hould be all clear profit. If this be true, for I pretend not to affirm it, it is as if a corn farmer expected to defray the expence of his cultivation with the chaff and the &s;traw, and that the grain &s;hould be all clear profit. We &s;ee frequently &s;ocieties of merchants in London and other trading towns, purcha&s;e wa&s;te lands in our
<PB N="197" REF="210">
&s;ugar colonies, which they expect to improve and cultivate with profit by means of factors and agents; notwith&s;tanding the great di&s;tance and the uncertain returns, from the defective admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in tho&s;e countries. Nobody will attempt to improve and cultivate in the &s;ame manner the mo&s;t fertile lands of Scotland, Ireland, or the corn provinces of North America; though from the more exact admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in the&s;e countries, more regular returns might be expected.</P>
<P>IN Virginia and Maryland the cultivation of tobacco is pre|ferred, as more profitable, to that of corn. Tobacco might be cultivated with advantage through the greater part of Eu|rope; but in almo&s;t every part of Europe it has become a prin|cipal &s;ubject of taxation, and to collect a tax from every dif|ferent farm in the country where this plant might happen to be cultivated, would be more diffioult, it has been &s;uppo&s;ed, than to levy one upon its importation at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. The cultiva|tion of tobacco has upon this account been mo&s;t ab&s;urdly prohi|bited through the greater part of Europe, which nece&s;&s;arily gives a &s;ort of monopoly to the countries where it is allowed; and as Vir|ginia and Maryland produce the greate&s;t quantity of it, they &s;hare largely, though with &s;ome competitors, in the advantage of this monopoly. The cultivation of tobacco, however, &s;eems not to be &s;o advantageous as that of &s;ugar. I have never even heard of any tobacco plantation that was improved and cultivated by the capital of merchants who re&s;ided in Great Britain, and our tobacco colonies &s;end us home no &s;uch wealthy planters as we &s;ee fre|quently arrive from our &s;ugar i&s;lands. Though from the preference given in tho&s;e colonies to the cultivation of tobacco above that of corn, it would appear that the effectual demand of Europe for tobacco is not compleatly &s;upplied, it probably is more nearly &s;o than that for &s;ugar: And though the pre&s;ent price of tobacco is probably more than &s;ufficient to pay the whole rent, wages, and
<PB N="198" REF="211">
profit nece&s;&s;ary for preparing and bringing it to market, according to the rate at which they are commonly paid in corn land; it mu&s;t not be &s;o much more as the pre&s;ent price of &s;ugar. Our tobacco planters, accordingly, have &s;hewn the &s;ame fear of the &s;uper-abun|dance of tobacco, which the proprietors of the old vineyards in France have of the &s;uper-abundance of wine. By act of a&s;&s;embly they have re&s;trained its cultivation to &s;ix thou&s;and plants, &s;uppo&s;ed to yield a thou&s;and weight of tobacco, for every negro between &s;ixteen and &s;ixty years of age. Such a negro, over and above this quantity of tobacco, can manage, they reckon, four acres of Indian corn. To prevent the market from being over&s;tocked too, they have &s;ometimes, in plentiful years, we are told by Dr. Dougla&s;s, (I &s;u&s;pect he has been ill informed) burnt a certain quantity of tobacco for every negro, in the &s;ame manner as the Dutch are &s;aid to do of &s;pices. If &s;uch violent methods are nece&s;&s;ary to keep up the pre&s;ent price of tobacco, the &s;uperior advantage of its culture over that of corn, if it &s;till has any, will not probably be of long continuance.</P>
<P>IT is in this manner that the rent of the cultivated land, of which the produce is human food, regulates the rent of the greater part of other cultivated land. No particular produce can long afford le&s;s; becau&s;e the land would immediately be turned to another u&s;e: And if any particular produce commonly affords more, it is becau&s;e the quantity of land which can be fitted for it is too &s;mall to &s;upply the effectual demand.</P>
<P>IN Europe corn is the principal produce of land which &s;erves immediately for human food. Except in particular &s;ituations, therefore, the rent of corn land regulates in Europe that of all other cultivated land. Britain need envy neither the vineyards of France nor the olive plantations of Italy. Except in particular
<PB N="199" REF="212">
&s;ituations, the value of the&s;e is regulated by that of corn, in which the fertility of Britain is not much inferior to that of either of tho&s;e two countries.</P>
<P>IF in any country the common and favourite vegetable food of the people &s;hould be drawn from a plant of which the mo&s;t com|mon land, with the &s;ame or nearly the &s;ame culture, produced a much greater quantity than the mo&s;t fertile does of corn, the rent of the landlord, or the &s;urplus quantity of food which would remain to him, after paying the labour and replacing the &s;tock of the farmer together with its ordinary profits, would nece&s;&s;arily be much greater. Whatever was the rate at which labour was com|monly maintained in that country, this greater &s;urplus could always maintain a greater quantity of it, and con&s;equently enable the landlord to purcha&s;e or command a greater quantity of it. The real value of his rent, his real power and authority, his command of the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life with which the labour of other people could &s;upply him, would nece&s;&s;arily be much greater.</P>
<P>A RICE field produces a much greater quantity of food than the mo&s;t fertile corn field. Two crops in the year from thirty to &s;ixty bu&s;hels each, are &s;aid to be the ordinary produce of an acre. Though its cultivation, therefore, requires more labour, a much greater &s;urplus remains after maintaining all that labour. In tho&s;e rice countries, therefore, where rice is the common and favourite vegetable food of the people, and where the cultivators are chiefly maintained with it, a greater &s;hare of this greater &s;urplus &s;hould belong to the landlord than in corn countries. In Carolina, where the planters, as in other Briti&s;h colonies, are gene|rally both farmers and landlords, and where rent con&s;equently is confounded with profit, tho cultivation of rice is found to be more
<PB N="200" REF="213">
profitable than that of corn, though their fields produce only one crop in the year, and though, from the prevalence of the cu&s;toms of Europe, rice is not there the common and favourite vegetable food of the people.</P>
<P>A GOOD rice field is a bog at all &s;ea&s;ons, and at one &s;ea&s;on a bog covered with water. It is unfit either for corn, or pa&s;ture, or vineyard, or, indeed, for any other vegetable produce that is very u&s;eful to men: And the lands which are fit for tho&s;e purpo&s;es, are not fit for rice. Even in the rice countries, therefore, the rent of rice lands cannot regulate the rent of the other cultivated land which can never be turned to that produce.</P>
<P>THE food produced by a field of potatoes is not inferior in quan|tity to that produced by a field of rice, and much &s;uperior to what is produced by a field of wheat. Twelve thou&s;and weight of potatoes from an acre of land is not a greater produce than two thou&s;and weight of wheat. The food or &s;olid nouri&s;hment, in|deed, which can be drawn from each of tho&s;e two plants, is not altogether in proportion to their weight, on account of the watery nature of potatoes. Allowing, however, half the weight of this root to go to water, a very large allowance, &s;uch an acre of pota|toes will &s;till produce &s;ix thou&s;and weight of &s;olid nouri&s;hment, three times the quantity produced by the acre of wheat. An acre of potatoes is cultivated with le&s;s expence than an acre of wheat: the fallow which generally preceeds the &s;owing of wheat, more than compen&s;ating the hoeing and other extraordinary culture which is always given to potatoes. Should this root ever become in any part of Europe, like rice in &s;ome rice countries, the common and favourite vegetable food of the people, &s;o as to occupy the &s;ame proportion of the lands in tillage which wheat and other &s;orts of grain for human food do at pre&s;ent, the &s;ame quantity of culti|vated
<PB N="201" REF="214">
land would maintain a much greater number of people, and the labourers being generally fed with potatoes, a greater &s;urplus would remain after replacing all the &s;tock and main|taining all the labour employed in cultivation. A greater &s;hare of this &s;urplus too would belong to the landlord. Population would increa&s;e, and rents would ri&s;e much beyond what they are at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE land which is fit for potatoes, is fit for almo&s;t every other u&s;eful vegetable. If they occupied the &s;ame proportion of culti|vated land which corn does at pre&s;ent, they would regulate, in the &s;ame manner, the rent of the greater part of other cultivated land.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome parts of Lanca&s;hire it is pretended, I have been told, that bread of oatmeal is a heartier food for labouring people than wheaten bread, and I have frequently heard the &s;ame doctrine held in Scotland. I am, however, &s;omewhat doubtful of the truth of it. The common people in Scotland, who are fed with oat|meal, are in general neither &s;o &s;trong nor &s;o hand&s;ome as the &s;ame rank of people in England, who are fed with wheaten bread. They neither work &s;o well nor look &s;o well; and as there is not the &s;ame difference between the people of fa&s;hion in the two coun|tries, experience would &s;eem to &s;how, that the food of the com|mon people in Scotland is not &s;o &s;uitable to the human con&s;titution as that of their neighbours of the &s;ame rank in England. But it &s;eems to be otherwi&s;e with potatoes. The chairmen, porters, and coalheavers in London, and tho&s;e unfortunate women who live by pro&s;titution, the &s;tronge&s;t men and the mo&s;t beautiful wo|men perhaps in the Briti&s;h dominions, are &s;aid to be, the greater part of them, from the lowe&s;t rank of people in Ireland, who are generally fed with this root. No food can afford a more de|ci&s;ive
<PB N="202" REF="215">
proof of its nouri&s;hing quality, or of its being peculiarly &s;uitable to the health of the human con&s;titution.</P>
<P>IT is difficult to pre&s;erve potatoes through the year, and impo&s;|&s;ible to &s;tore them like corn, for two or three years together. The fear of not being able to &s;ell them before they rot, di&s;courages their cultivation, and is, perhaps, the chief ob&s;tacle to their ever becoming in any great country, like bread, the principal vegetable food of all the different ranks of the people.</P>

<HEAD>PART II. <HI>Of the Produce of Land which &s;ometimes does, and &s;ometimes does not, afford Rent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HUMAN food &s;eems to be the only produce of land which always and nece&s;&s;arily affords &s;ome rent to the landlord. Other &s;orts of produce &s;ometimes may and &s;ometimes may not, ac|cording to different circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>AFTER food, cloathing and lodging are the two great wants of mankind.</P>
<P>LAND in its original rude &s;tate can afford the materials of cloath|ing and lodging to a much greater number of people than it can feed. In its improved &s;tate it can &s;ometimes feed a greater num|ber of people than it can &s;upply with tho&s;e materials, at lea&s;t in the way in which they require them, and are willing to pay for them. In the one &s;tate, therefore, there is always a &s;uper|abundance of tho&s;e materials, which are frequently upon that account of little or no value. In the other there is often a &s;carcity, which nece&s;&s;arily augments their value. In the one &s;tate a great
<PB N="203" REF="216">
part of them is thrown away as u&s;ele&s;s, and the price of what is u&s;ed is con&s;idered as equal only to the labour and expence of fitting it for u&s;e, and can, therefore, afford no rent to the landlord. In the other they are all made u&s;e of, and there is frequently a demand for more than can be had. Somebody is always willing to give more for every part of them than what is &s;ufficient to pay the expence of bringing them to market. Their price, therefore, can always afford &s;ome rent to the landlord.</P>
<P>THE &s;kins of the larger animals were the original materials of cloathing. Among nations of hunters and &s;hepherds, therefore, who&s;e food con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the fle&s;h of tho&s;e animals, every man by providing him&s;elf with food, provides him&s;elf with the mate|rials of more cloathing than he can wear. If there was no foreign commerce, the greater part of them would be thrown away as things of no value. This was probably the ca&s;e among the hunting nations of North America, before their country was di&s;covered by the Europeans, with whom they now exchange their &s;urplus peltry, for blankets, fire-arms, and brandy, which gives it &s;ome value. In the pre&s;ent commercial &s;tate of the known world, the mo&s;t barbarous nations, I believe, among whom land property is e&s;tabli&s;hed, have &s;ome foreign commerce of this kind, and find among their wealthier neighbours &s;uch a demand for all the ma|terials of cloathing, which their land produces, and which can neither be wrought up nor con&s;umed at home, as rai&s;es their price above what it co&s;ts to &s;end them thither. It affords, therefore, &s;ome rent to the landlord. When the greater part of the highland cattle were con&s;umed on their own hills, the exportation of their hides made the mo&s;t con&s;iderable article of the commerce of that country, and what they were exchanged for afforded &s;ome addition to the rent of the highland e&s;tates. The wool of England, which in old times could neither be con&s;umed nor wrought up at home,
<PB N="204" REF="217">
found a market in the then wealthier and more indu&s;trious country of Flanders, and its price afforded &s;omething to the rent of the land which produced it. In countries not better cultivated than Eng|land was then, or than the highlands of Scotland are now, and which had no foreign commerce, the materials of cloathing would evidently be &s;o &s;uper-abundant, that a great part of them would be thrown away as u&s;ele&s;s, and no part could afford any rent to the landlord.</P>
<P>THE materials of lodging cannot always be tran&s;ported to &s;o great a di&s;tance as tho&s;e of cloathing, and do not &s;o readily become an object of foreign commerce. When they are &s;u|per-abundant in the country which produces them, it fre|quently happens, even in the pre&s;ent commercial &s;tate of the world, that they are of no value to the landlord. A good &s;tone quarry in the neighbourhood of London would afford a con&s;ider|able rent. In many parts of Scotland and Wales it affords none. Barren timber for building is of great value in a populous and well|cultivated country, and the land which produces it, affords a con|&s;iderable rent. But in many parts of North America the land|lord would be much obliged to any body who would carry away the greater part of his large trees. In &s;ome parts of the highlands of Scotland the bark is the only part of the wood which, for want of roads and water-carriage, can be &s;ent to market. The timber is left to rot upon the ground. When the materials of lodging are &s;o &s;uper-abundant, the part made u&s;e of is worth only the labour and expence of fitting it for that u&s;e. It affords no rent to the landlord, who generally grants the u&s;e of it to whoever takes the trouble of a&s;king it. The demand of wealthier nations, however, &s;ometimes enables him to get a rent for it. The paving of the &s;treets of London has enabled the owners of &s;ome barren rocks on the coa&s;t of Scotland to draw a rent from what never af|forded
<PB N="205" REF="218">
any before. The woods of Norway and of the coa&s;ts of the Baltick, find a market in many parts of Great Britain which they could not find at home, and thereby afford &s;ome rent to their proprietors.</P>
<P>COUNTRIES are populous, not in proportion to the number of people whom their produce can cloath and lodge, but in pro|portion to that of tho&s;e whom it can feed. When food is pro|vided, it is ea&s;y to find the nece&s;&s;ary cloathing and lodging. But though the&s;e are at hand, it may often be difficult to find food. In &s;ome parts even of the Briti&s;h dominions what is called A Hou&s;e, may be built by one day's labour of one man. The &s;imple&s;t &s;pecies of cloathing, the &s;kins of animals, requires &s;omewhat more labour to dre&s;s and prepare them for u&s;e. They do not, however, require a great deal. Among &s;avage and barbarous nations, a hundredth or little more than a hundredth part of the labour of the whole year, will be &s;ufficient to provide them with &s;uch cloath|ing and lodging as &s;atisfy the greater part of the people. All the other ninety-nine parts are frequently no more than enough to provide them with food.</P>
<P>BUT when by the improvement and cultivation of land the la|bour of one family can provide food for two, the labour of half the &s;ociety becomes &s;ufficient to provide food for the whole. The other half, therefore, or at lea&s;t the greater part of them, can be employed in providing other things, or in &s;atisfying the other wants and fancies of mankind. Cloathing and lodging, hou&s;ehold fur|niture, and what is called Equipage, are the principal objects of the greater part of tho&s;e wants and fancies. The rich man con|&s;umes no more food than his poor neighbour. In quality it may be very different, and to &s;elect and prepare it may require more labour and art; but in quantity it is very nearly the &s;ame. But
<PB N="206" REF="219">
compare the &s;pacious palace and great wardrobe of the one, with the hovel and the few rags of the other, and you will be &s;en&s;ible that the difference between their cloathing, lodging, and hou&s;e|hold furniture, is almo&s;t as great in quantity as it is in quality. The de&s;ire of food is limited in every man by the narrow capacity of the human &s;tomach; but the de&s;ire of the conveniencies and ornaments of building, dre&s;s, equipage, and hou&s;ehold furniture, &s;eems to have no limit or certain boundary. Tho&s;e, therefore, who have the command of more food than they them&s;elves can con&s;ume, are always willing to exchange the &s;urplus, or, what is the &s;ame thing, the price of it, for gratifications of this other kind. What is over and above &s;atisfying the limited de&s;ire, is given for the amu&s;ement of tho&s;e de&s;ires which cannot be &s;atisfied, but &s;eem to be altogether endle&s;s. The poor, in order to obtain food, exert them&s;eves to gratify tho&s;e fancies of the rich, and to obtain it more certainly, they vie with one another in the cheap|ne&s;s and perfection of their work. The number of workmen in|crea&s;es with the increa&s;ing quantity of food, or with the growing improvement and cultivation of the lands; and as the nature of their bu&s;ine&s;s admits of the utmo&s;t &s;ubdivi&s;ions of labour, the quantity of materials which they can work up, increa&s;es in a much greater proportion than their numbers. Hence ari&s;es a demand for every &s;ort of material which human invention can employ, either u&s;efully or ornamentally in building, dre&s;s, equipage, or hou&s;ehold furniture; for the fo&s;&s;ils and minerals contained in the bowels of the earth; the precious metals, and the precious &s;tones.</P>
<P>FOOD is in this manner, not only the original &s;ource of rent, but every other part of the produce of land which afterwards affords rent, derives that part of its value from the improvement of the powers of labour in producing food by means of the improve|ment and cultivation of land.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="220">
THOSE other parts of the produce of land, however, which afterwards afford rent, do not afford it always. Even in improved and cultivated countries, the demand for them is not always &s;uch as to afford a greater price than what is &s;ufficient to pay the la|bour, and replace, together with its ordinary profits, the &s;tock which mu&s;t be employed in bringing them to market. Whether it is or is not &s;uch, depends upon different circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>WHETHER a coal-mine, for example, can afford any rent, depends partly upon its fertility, and partly upon its &s;ituation.</P>
<P>A MINE of any kind may be &s;aid to be either fertile or barren, according as the quantity of mineral which can be brought from it by a certain quantity of labour, is greater or le&s;s than what can be brought by an equal quantity from the greater part of other mines of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>SOME coal-mines advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated, cannot be wrought on account of their barrenne&s;s. The produce does not pay the expence. They can afford neither profit nor rent.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome of which the produce is barely &s;ufficient to pay the labour, and replace, together with its ordinary profits, the &s;tock employed in working them. They afford &s;ome profit to the undertaker of the work, but no rent to the landlord. They can be wrought advantageou&s;ly by nobody but the landlord, who being him&s;elf undertaker of the work, gets the ordinary profit of the capital which he employs in it. Many coal-mines in Scotland are wrought in this manner, and can be wrought in no other. The landlord will allow no body el&s;e to work them without paying &s;ome rent, and no body can afford to pay any.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="221">
OTHER coal-mines in the &s;ame country &s;ufficiently fertile, can|not be wrought on account of their &s;ituation. A quantity of mineral &s;ufficient to defray the expence of working, could be brought from the mine by the ordinary, or even le&s;s than the ordinary quantity of labour: But in an inland country, thinly inhabited, and without either good roads or water-carriage, this quantity could not be &s;old.</P>
<P>COALS are a le&s;s agreeable fewel than wood: they are &s;aid too to be le&s;s whole&s;ome. The expence of coals, therefore, at the place where they are con&s;umed, mu&s;t generally be &s;omewhat le&s;s than that of wood.</P>
<P>THE price of wood again varies with the &s;tate of agriculture, nearly in the &s;ame manner, and exactly for the &s;ame rea&s;on, as the price of cattle. In its rude beginnings, the greater part of every country is covered with wood, which is then a mere incumbrance of no value to the landlord, who would gladly give it to any body for the cutting. As agriculture advances, the woods are partly cleared by the progre&s;s of tillage, and partly go to decay in con&s;equence of the increa&s;ed number of cattle. The&s;e, though they do not increa&s;e in the &s;ame proportion as corn, which is altogether the acqui&s;ition of human indu&s;try, yet multiply under the care and protection of men; who &s;tore up in the &s;ea&s;on of plenty what may maintain them in that of &s;carcity, who through the whole year furni&s;h them with a greater quantity of food than uncultivated nature provides for them, and who by de&s;troying and extirpating their enemies, &s;ecure them in the free enjoyment of all that &s;he provides. Nu|merous herds of cattle, when allowed to wander through the woods, though they do not de&s;troy the old trees, hinder any young ones from coming up, &s;o that in the cour&s;e of a century or two the whole fore&s;t goes to ruin. The &s;carcity of wood then rai&s;es its
<PB N="209" REF="222">
price. It affords a good rent, and the landlord &s;ometimes finds that he can &s;carce employ his be&s;t lands more advantageou&s;ly than in growing barren timber, of which the greatne&s;s of the profit often compen&s;ates the latene&s;s of the returns. This &s;eems in the pre&s;ent times to be nearly the &s;tate of things in &s;everal parts of Great Britain, where the profit of planting is found to be equal to that of either corn or pa&s;ture. The advantage which the landlord derives from planting, can no where exceed, at lea&s;t for any con&s;iderable time, the rent which the&s;e could afford him; and in an inland country which is highly cultivated, it will fre|quently not fall much &s;hort of this rent. Upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t of a well improved country, indeed, if it can conveniently get coals for fewel, it may &s;ometimes be cheaper to bring barren timber for building from le&s;s cultivated foreign countries, than to rai&s;e it at home. In the new town of Edinburgh, built within the&s;e few years, there is not, perhaps, a &s;ingle &s;tick of Scotch timber.</P>
<P>WHATEVER may be the price of wood, if that of coals is &s;uch that the expence of a coal-fire is nearly equal to that of a wood one, we may be a&s;&s;ured, that at that place, and in the&s;e circum&s;tances, the price of coals is as high as it can be. It &s;eems to be &s;o in &s;ome of the inland parts of England, particularly in Oxford&s;hire, where it is u&s;ual, even in the fires of the common people, to mix coals and wood together, and where the difference in the expence of tho&s;e two &s;orts of fewel cannot, therefore, be very great.</P>
<P>COALS, in the coal countries, are every where much below this highe&s;t price. If they were not, they could not bear the expence of a di&s;tant carriage, either by land or by water. A &s;mall quantity only could be &s;old, and the coal ma&s;ters and coal proprietors find it more for their intere&s;t to &s;ell a great quantity at a price &s;ome|what above the lowe&s;t, than a &s;mall quantity at the highe&s;t. The
<PB N="210" REF="223">
mo&s;t fertile coal-mine too, regulates the price of coals at all the other mines in its neighbourhood. Both the proprietor and the undertaker of the work find, the one that he can get a greater rent, the other that he can get a greater profit, by &s;omewhat un|der&s;elling all their neighbours. Their neighbours are &s;oon obliged to &s;ell at the &s;ame price, though they cannot &s;o well afford it, and though it always dimini&s;hes, and &s;ometimes takes away altogether both their rent and their profit. Some works are abandoned al|together; others can afford no rent, and can be wrought only by the proprietor.</P>
<P>THE lowe&s;t price at which coals can be &s;old for any con&s;iderable time, is like that of all other commodities, the price which is barely &s;ufficient to replace, together with its ordinary profits, the &s;tock which mu&s;t be employed in bringing them to market. At a coal-mine for which the landlord can get no rent, but which he mu&s;t either work him&s;elf or let it alone altogether, the price of coals mu&s;t generally be nearly about this price.</P>
<P>RENT, even where coals afford one, has generally a &s;maller &s;hare in their price than in that of mo&s;t other parts of the rude pro|duce of land. The rent of an e&s;tate above ground, commonly amounts to what is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a third of the gro&s;s produce; and it is generally a rent certain and independent of the occa&s;ional variations in the crop. In coal-mines a fifth of the gro&s;s produce is a very great rent; a tenth the common rent, and it is &s;eldom a rent certain, but depends upon the occa&s;ional variations in the produce. The&s;e are &s;o great, that in a country where thirty years purcha&s;e is con&s;idered as a moderate price for the property of a landed e&s;tate, ten years purcha&s;e is regarded as a good price for that of a coal-mine.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="224">
THE value of a coal-mine to the proprietor depends frequently as much upon its &s;ituation as upon its fertility. That of a metallick mine depends more upon its fertility, and le&s;s upon its &s;ituation. The coar&s;e, and &s;till more the precious metals, when &s;eparated from the ore, are &s;o valuable that they can generally bear the expence of a very long land, and of the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;ea-carriage. Their market is not confined to the countries in the neighbourhood of the mine, but extends to the whole world. The copper of Japan makes an article in the commerce of Europe; the iron of Spain in that of Chili and Peru. The &s;ilver of Peru finds its way, not only to Europe, but from Europe to China.</P>
<P>THE price of coals in We&s;tmoreland or Shrop&s;hire can have little effect on their price at Newca&s;tle; and their price in the Lionnois can have none at all. The productions of &s;uch di&s;tant coal-mines can never be brought into competition with one another. But the productions of the mo&s;t di&s;tant metallick mines frequently may, and in fact commonly are. The price, therefore, of the coar&s;e, and &s;till more that of the precious metals, at the mo&s;t fertile mines in the world, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily more or le&s;s affect their price at every other in it. The price of copper in Japan mu&s;t have &s;ome influence upon its price at the copper mines in Europe. The price of &s;ilver in Peru, or the quantity either of labour or of other goods which it will purcha&s;e there, mu&s;t have &s;ome influence on its price, not only at the &s;ilver mines of Europe, but at tho&s;e of China. After the di&s;covery of the mines of Peru, the &s;ilver mines of Europe were, the greater part of them, abandoned. The value of &s;ilver was &s;o much reduced that their produce could no longer pay the expence of working them, or replace, with a profit, the food, cloaths, lodging, and other nece&s;&s;aries which were con&s;umed in that operation. This was the ca&s;e too with the mines of Cuba and St. Domingo, and even with the antient mines of Peru, after the di&s;covery of tho&s;e of Poto&s;i.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="225">
THE price of every metal at every mine, therefore, being regulat|ed in &s;ome mea&s;ure by its price at the mo&s;t fertile mine in the world that is actually wrought, it can at the greater part of mines do very little more than pay the expence of working, and can &s;eldom afford a very high rent to the landlord. Rent, accordingly, &s;eems at the greater part of mines to have but a &s;mall &s;hare in the price of the coar&s;e, and a &s;till &s;maller in that of the precious metals. Labour and profit make up the greater part of both.</P>
<P>A SIXTH part of the gro&s;s produce may be reckoned the average rent of the tin mines of Cornwal, the mo&s;t fertile that are known in the world, as we are told by the Reverend Mr. Borlace, vice-warden of the &s;tannaries. Some, he &s;ays, afford more, and &s;ome do not afford &s;o much. A &s;ixth part of the gro&s;s pro|duce is the rent too of &s;everal very fertile lead mines in Scot|land.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ilver mines of Peru, we are told by Frezier and Ulloa, the proprietor frequently exacts no other acknowledgement from the undertaker of the mine, but that he will grind the ore at his mill, paying him the ordinary multure or price of grinding. The tax of the king of Spain, indeed, amounts to one-fifth of the &s;tandard &s;ilver, which may be con&s;idered as the real rent of the greater part of the &s;ilver mines of Peru, the riche&s;t which are known in the world. If there was no tax, this fifth would naturally belong to the landlord, and many mines might be wrought which cannot be wrought at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e they can|not afford this tax. The tax of the duke of Cornwal upon tin is &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to more than five per cent. or one twentieth part of the value; and whatever may be his proportion it would naturally too belong to the proprietor of the mine, if tin was duty free. But if you add one-twentieth to one &s;ixth, you
<PB N="213" REF="226">
will find that the whole average rent of the tin mines of Corn|wal, is to the whole average rent of the &s;ilver mines of Peru, as thirteen to twelve. The high tax upon &s;ilver too, gives much greater temptation to &s;muggling than the low tax upon tin, and &s;muggling mu&s;t be much ea&s;ier in the precious than in the bulky commodity. The tax of the king of Spain accordingly is &s;aid to be very ill paid, and that of the duke of Cornwal very well. Rent, therefore, it is probable, makes a greater part of the price of tin at the mo&s;t fertile tin mines, than it does of &s;ilver at the mo&s;t fertile &s;ilver mines in the world. After replacing the &s;tock employed in working tho&s;e different mines, together with its ordinary profits, the re&s;idue which remains to the proprietor is greater it &s;eems in the coar&s;e than in the precious metal.</P>
<P>NEITHER are the profits of the undertakers of &s;ilver mines commonly very great in Peru. The &s;ame mo&s;t re&s;pectable and well informed authors acquaint us that when any per&s;on under|takes to work a new mine in Peru, he is univer&s;ally looked upon as a man de&s;tined to bankruptcy and ruin, and is upon that ac|count &s;hunned and avoided by every body. Mining, it &s;eems, is con&s;idered there in the &s;ame light as here, as a lottery in which the prizes do not compen&s;ate the blanks, though the greatne&s;s of &s;ome tempts many adventurers to throw away their fortunes in &s;uch unpro&s;perous projects.</P>
<P>AS the &s;overeign, however, derives a con&s;iderable part of his revenue from the produce of &s;ilver mines, the law in Peru gives every po&s;&s;ible encouragement to the di&s;covery and working of new ones. Whoever di&s;covers a new mine, is entitled to mea&s;ure off two hundred and forty-&s;ix feet in length, according to what he &s;uppo&s;es to be the direction of the vein, and half as much in breadth. He becomes proprietor of this portion of the mine,
<PB N="214" REF="227">
and can work it without paying any acknowledgement to the landlord. The intere&s;t of the duke of Cornwal has given oc|ca&s;ion to a regulation nearly of the &s;ame kind in that antient dutchy. In wa&s;te and uninclo&s;ed lands any per&s;on who di&s;|covers a tin mine, may mark out its limits to a certain extent, which is called bounding a mine. The bounder becomes the real proprietor of the mine, and may either work it him&s;elf, or give it in lea&s;e to another, without the con&s;ent of the owner of the land, to whom, however, a very &s;mall acknowledgement mu&s;t be paid upon working it. In both regulations the &s;acred rights of pri|vate property are &s;acrificed to the &s;uppo&s;ed intere&s;ts of publick revenue.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame encouragement is given in Peru to the di&s;covery and working of new gold mines; and in gold the king's tax amounts only to a twentieth part of the &s;tandard metal. It was once a fifth, as in &s;ilver, but it was found the work could not bear it. If it is rare, however, &s;ay the &s;ame authors, Frezier and Ulloa, to find a per&s;on who has made his fortune by a &s;ilver, it is &s;till much rarer to find one who has done &s;o by a gold mine. This twentieth part &s;eems to be the whole rent which is paid by the greater part of the gold mines in Chili and Peru. Gold too is much more liable to be &s;muggled than even &s;ilver; not only on account of the &s;uperior value of the metal in proportion to its bulk, but on account of the peculiar way in which nature produces it. Silver is very &s;eldom found virgin, but, like mo&s;t other metals, is generally mineralized with &s;ome other body, from which it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate it in &s;uch quantities as will pay for the expence, but by a very laborious and tedious operation, which cannot well be carried on but in workhou&s;es erected for the purpo&s;e, and therefore expo&s;ed to the in&s;pection of the king's officers. Gold, on the contrary, is almo&s;t always found virgin. It is
<PB N="215" REF="228">
&s;ometimes found in pieces of &s;ome bulk; and even when mixed in &s;mall and almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible particles with &s;and, earth, and other extraneous bodies, it can be &s;eparated from them by a very &s;hort and &s;imple operation, which can be carried on in any private hou&s;e by any body who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;mall quantity of mer|cury. If the king's tax, therefore, is but ill paid upon &s;ilver, it is likely to be much wor&s;e paid upon gold; and rent mu&s;t make a much &s;maller part of the price of gold, than even of that of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>THE lowe&s;t price at which the precious metals can be &s;old, or the &s;malle&s;t quantity of other goods for which they can be ex|changed during any con&s;iderable time, is regulated by the &s;ame principles which fix the lowe&s;t ordinary price of all other goods. The &s;tock which mu&s;t commonly be employed, the food, cloaths, and lodging, which mu&s;t commonly be con&s;umed in bringing them from the mine to the market, determine it. It mu&s;t at lea&s;t be &s;ufficient to replace that &s;tock, with the ordinary profits.</P>
<P>THEIR highe&s;t price, however, &s;eems not to be nece&s;&s;arily deter|mined by any thing but the actual &s;carcity or plenty of tho&s;e metals them&s;elves. It is not determined by that of any other commo|dity, in the &s;ame manner as the price of coals is by that of wood, beyond which no &s;carcity can ever rai&s;e it. Increa&s;e the &s;carcity of gold to a certain degree, and the &s;malle&s;t bit of it may become more precious than a diamond, and exchange for a greater quantity of other goods.</P>
<P>THE demand for tho&s;e metals ari&s;es partly from their utility, and partly from their beauty. If you except iron, they are more u&s;eful than, perhaps, any other metal. As they are le&s;s liable to ru&s;t and impurity, they can more ea&s;ily be kept clean; and the uten|&s;ils
<PB N="216" REF="229">
either of the table or the kitchen are often upon that account more agreeable when made of them. A &s;ilver boiler is more cleanly than a lead, copper, or tin one; and the &s;ame quality would render a gold boiler &s;till better than a &s;ilver one. Their principal merit, however, ari&s;es from their beauty, which renders them peculiarly fit for the ornaments of dre&s;s and furniture. No paint or dye can give &s;o &s;plendid a colour as gilding. The merit of their beauty is greatly enhanced by their &s;carcity. With the greater part of rich people, the chief enjoyment of riches con|&s;i&s;ts in the parade of riches, which in their eyes is never &s;o com|pleat as when they appear to po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e deci&s;ive marks of opulence which nobody can po&s;&s;e&s;s but them&s;elves. In their eyes the merit of an object which is in any degree either u&s;eful or beautiful, is greatly enhanced by its &s;carcity, or by the great labour which it requires to collect any con&s;iderable quantity of it, a labour which no body can afford to pay but them&s;elves. Such objects they are willing to purcha&s;e at a higher price than things much more beautiful and u&s;eful, but more common. The&s;e qua|lities of utility, beauty, and &s;carcity, are the original foundation of the high price of tho&s;e metals, or of the great quantity of other goods for which they can every where be exchanged. This value was antecedent to and independant of their being employed as coin, and was the quality which fitted them for that employ|ment. That employment, however, by occa&s;ioning a new de|mand, and by dimini&s;hing the quantity which could be employed in any other way, may have afterwards contributed to keep up or increa&s;e their value.</P>
<P>THE demand for the precious &s;tones ari&s;es altogether from their beauty. They are of no u&s;e, but as ornaments; and the merit of their beauty is greatly enhanced by their &s;carcity, or by the difficulty and expence of getting them from the mine. Wages
<PB N="217" REF="230">
and profit accordingly make up, upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions, almo&s;t the whole of their high price. Rent comes in but for a very &s;mall &s;hare; frequently for no &s;hare; and the mo&s;t fertile mines only afford any con&s;iderable rent. When Tavernier, a jeweller, vi&s;ited the dia|mond mines of Golconda and Vi&s;iapour, he was informed that the &s;overeign of the country, for who&s;e benefit they were wrought, had ordered all of them to be &s;hut up except tho&s;e which yielded the large&s;t and fine&s;t &s;tones. The others, it &s;eems, were to the proprietor not worth the working.</P>
<P>As the price both of the precious metals and of the precious &s;tones is regulated all over the world by their price at the mo&s;t fertile mine in it, the rent which a mine of either can afford to its proprietor is in proportion, not to its ab&s;olute, but to what may be called its relative fertility, or to its &s;uperiority over other mines of the &s;ame kind. If new mines were di&s;covered as much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of Poto&s;i as they were &s;uperior to tho&s;e of Europe, the value of &s;ilver might be &s;o much degraded as to render even the mines of Poto&s;i not worth the working. Before the di&s;covery of the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies, the mo&s;t fertile mines in Europe may have afforded as great a rent to their proprietor as the riche&s;t mines in Peru do at pre&s;ent. Though the quantity of &s;ilver was much le&s;s, it might have exchanged for an equal quantity of other goods, and the proprietor's &s;hare might have enabled him to purcha&s;e or com|mand an equal quantity either of labour or of commodities. The value both of the produce and of the rent, the real revenue which they afforded both to the publick and to the proprietor, might have been the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t abundant mines either of the precious metals or of the precious &s;tones could add little to the wealth of the world. A pro|duce of which the value is principally derived from its &s;carcity, is
<PB N="218" REF="231">
nece&s;&s;arily degraded by its abundance. A &s;ervice of plate, and the other frivolous ornaments of dre&s;s and furniture, could be purcha&s;ed for a &s;maller quantity of labour, or for a &s;maller quantity of com|modities; and in this would con&s;i&s;t the &s;ole advantage which the world could derive from that abundance.</P>
<P>IT is otherwi&s;e in e&s;tates above ground. The value both of their produce and of their rent is in proportion to their ab&s;olute, and not to their relative fertility. The land which produces a certain quantity of food, cloaths and lodging, can always feed, cloath and lodge a certain number of people; and whatever may be the proportion of the landlord, it will always give him a propor|tionable command of the labour of tho&s;e people, and of the com|modities with which that labour can &s;upply him. The value of the mo&s;t barren lands is not dimini&s;hed by the neighbourhood of the mo&s;t fertile. On the contrary, it is generally increa&s;ed by it. The great number of people maintained by the fertile lands afford a market to many parts of the produce of the barren, which they could never have found among tho&s;e whom their own produce could maintain.</P>
<P>WHATEVER increa&s;es the fertility of land in producing food, increa&s;es not only the value of the lands upon which the improve|ment is be&s;towed, but contributes likewi&s;e to increa&s;e that of many other lands, by creating a new demand for their produce. That abundance of food, of which, in con&s;equence of the improvement of land, many people have the di&s;po&s;al beyond what they them|&s;elves can con&s;ume, is the great cau&s;e of the demand both for the precious metals and the precious &s;tones, as well as for every other conveniency and ornament of dre&s;s, lodging, hou&s;hold furniture, and equipage. Food not only con&s;titutes the principal part of the riches of the world, but it is the abundance of food which gives
<PB N="219" REF="232">
the principal part of their value to many other &s;orts of riches. The poor inhabitants of Cuba and St. Domingo, when they were fir&s;t di&s;covered by the Spaniards, u&s;ed to wear little bits of gold as ornaments in their hair and other parts of their dre&s;s. They &s;eemed to value them as we would do any little pebbles of &s;ome|what more than ordinary beauty, and to con&s;ider them as ju&s;t worth the picking up, but not worth the refu&s;ing to any body who a&s;ked them. They gave them to their new gue&s;ts at the fir&s;t reque&s;t, without &s;eeming to think that they had made them any very valu|able pre&s;ent. They were a&s;toni&s;hed to ob&s;erve the rage of the Spaniards to obtain them; and had no notion that there could any where be a country in which many people had the di&s;po&s;al of &s;o great a &s;uperfluity of food, &s;o &s;canty always among them&s;elves, that for a very &s;mall quantity of tho&s;e glittering baubles they would willingly give as much as might maintain a whole family for many years. Could they have been made to under&s;tand this, the pa&s;&s;ion of the Spaniards would not have &s;urpri&s;ed them.</P>

<HEAD>PART III. <HI>Of the Variations in the Proportion between the re&s;pective Values of that Sort of Produce which always affords Rent, and of that which &s;ometimes does and &s;ometimes does not afford Rent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE increa&s;ing abundance of food, in con&s;equence of in|crea&s;ing improvement and cultivation, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e the demand for every part of the produce of land which is not food, and which can be applied either to u&s;e or to ornament. In the whole progre&s;s of improvement, it might therefore be expected, there &s;hould be only one variation in the comparative values of tho&s;e two different &s;orts of produce. The value of that &s;ort which &s;ometimes does and &s;ometimes does not afford rent, &s;hould con|&s;tantly ri&s;e in proportion to that which always affords &s;ome rent.
<PB N="220" REF="233">
As art and indu&s;try advance, the materials of cloathing and lodg|ing, the u&s;eful fo&s;&s;ils and minerals of the earth, the precious metals and the precious &s;tones &s;hould gradually come to be more and more in demand, &s;hould gradually exchange for a greater and a greater quantity of food, or in other words, &s;hould gradually be|come dearer and dearer. This accordingly has been the ca&s;e with mo&s;t of the&s;e things upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions, and would have been the ca&s;e with all of them upon all occa&s;ions, if particular accidents had not upon &s;ome occa&s;ions increa&s;ed the &s;upply of &s;ome of them in a &s;till greater proportion than the demand.</P>
<P>THE value of a free-&s;tone quarry, for example, will nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e with the increa&s;ing improvement and population of the country round about it; e&s;pecially if it &s;hould be the only one in the neighbourhood. But the value of a &s;ilver mine, even though there &s;hould not be another within a thou&s;and miles of it, will not nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e with the improvement of the country in which it is &s;ituated. The market for the produce of a free-&s;tone quarry can &s;eldom extend more than a few miles round about it, and the demand mu&s;t generally be in proportion to the improvement and population of that &s;mall di&s;trict. But the market for the produce of a &s;ilver mine may extend over the whole known world. Unle&s;s the world in general, therefore, be advancing in improvement and population, the demand for &s;ilver might not be at all increa&s;ed by the improvement even of a large country in the neighbourhood of the mine. Even though the world in general were improving, yet, if in the cour&s;e of its improvement, new mines &s;hould be di&s;|covered, much more fertile than any which had been known before, though the demand for &s;ilver would nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e, yet the &s;upply might increa&s;e in &s;o much a greater proportion, that the real price of that metal might gradually fall; that is, any given quantity, a pound weight of it, for example, might gradually
<PB N="221" REF="234">
purcha&s;e or command a &s;maller and a &s;maller quantity of labour, or exchange for a &s;maller and a &s;maller quantity of corn, the prin|cipal part of the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the labourer.</P>
<P>THE great market for &s;ilver is the commercial and civilzed part of the world.</P>
<P>IF by the general progre&s;s of improvement the demand of this market &s;hould increa&s;e, while at the &s;ame time the &s;upply did not increa&s;e in the &s;ame proportion, the value of &s;ilver would gradually ri&s;e in proportion to that of corn. Any given quantity of &s;ilver would exchange for a greater and a greater quantity of corn; or, in other words, the average money price of corn would gradually become cheaper and cheaper.</P>
<P>IF, on the contrary, the &s;upply by &s;ome accident &s;hould increa&s;e for many years together in a greater proportion than the demand, that metal would gradually become cheaper and cheaper; or, in other words, the average money price of corn would, in &s;pite of all improvements, gradually become dearer and dearer.</P>
<P>BUT if, on the other hand, the &s;upply of that metal &s;hould in|crea&s;e nearly in the &s;ame proportion as the demand, it would continue to purcha&s;e or exchange for nearly the &s;ame quantity of corn, and the average money price of corn would, in &s;pite of all improvements, continue very nearly the &s;ame.</P>

<HEAD>Digre&s;&s;ion concerning the Variations in the Value of Silver during the Cour&s;e of the Four la&s;t Centuries.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="period">
<HEAD>FIRST PERIOD.</HEAD>
<P>IN 1350, and for &s;ome time before, the average price of the quarter of wheat in England &s;eems not to have been e&s;timated lower than four ounces of &s;ilver Tower-weight, equal to about twenty &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money. From this price it &s;eems to have fallen gradually to two ounces of &s;ilver, equal to about ten &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money, the price at which we find it e&s;ti|mated in the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, and at which it &s;eems to have continued to be e&s;timated till about 1570.</P>
<P>IN 1350, being the 25th of Edward III, was enacted what is called, The &s;tatute of labourers. In the preamble it complains much of the in&s;olence of &s;ervants, who endeavoured to rai&s;e their wages upon their ma&s;ters. It therefore ordains, that all &s;ervants and labourers &s;hould for the future be contented with the &s;ame wages and liveries (liveries in tho&s;e times &s;ignified, not only cloaths, but provi&s;ions) which they had been accu&s;tomed to receive in the 20th year of the king, and the four preceeding years; that upon this account their livery wheat &s;hould no where be e&s;timated higher than ten-pence a bu&s;hel, and that it &s;hould always be in the option of the ma&s;ter to deliver them either the wheat or the money. Ten-pence a bu&s;hel, therefore, had in the 25th of Edward III, been reckoned a very moderate price of wheat, &s;ince it required a particular &s;tatute to oblige &s;ervants to accept of it in exchange for
<PB N="223" REF="236">
their u&s;ual livery of provi&s;ions; and it had been reckoned a rea|&s;onable price ten years before that, or in the 16th year of the king, the term to which the &s;tatute refers. But in the 16th year of Edward III, ten-pence contained about half an ounce of &s;ilver Tower-weight, and was nearly equal to half a crown of our pre&s;ent money. Four ounces of &s;ilver, Tower-weight, therefore, equal to &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence of the money of tho&s;e times, and to near twenty &s;hillings of that of the pre&s;ent, mu&s;t have been reckoned a moderate price for the quarter of eight bu&s;hels.</P>
<P>THIS &s;tatute is &s;urely a better evidence of what was reckoned in tho&s;e times a moderate price of grain, than the prices of &s;ome par|ticular years, which have generally been recorded by hi&s;torians and other writers on account of their extraordinary dearne&s;s or cheapne&s;s, and from which, therefore, it is difficult to form any judgement concerning what may have been the ordinary price. There are, be&s;ides, other rea&s;ons for believing that in the begin|ning of the fourteenth century, and for &s;ome time before, the com|mon price of wheat was not le&s;s than four ounces of &s;ilver the quarter, and that of other grain in proportion.</P>
<P>IN 1309, Ralph de Born, prior of St. Augu&s;tine's Canterbury, gave a fea&s;t upon his in&s;tallation day, of which William Thorn has pre&s;erved, not only the bill of fare, but the prices of many particulars. In that fea&s;t were con&s;umed, 1&s;t, fifty-three quarters of wheat, which co&s;t nineteen pounds, or &s;even &s;hillings and two|pence a quarter, equal to about one and twenty &s;hillings and &s;ix|pence of our pre&s;ent money: 2dly, Fifty-eight quarters of malt, which co&s;t &s;eventeen pounds ten &s;hillings, or &s;ix &s;hillings a quarter, equal to about eighteen &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money: 3dly, Twenty quarters of oats, which co&s;t four pounds, or four &s;hillings a quarter, equal to about twelve &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money.
<PB N="224" REF="237">
The prices of malt and oats &s;eem here to be higher than their ordi|nary proportion to the price of wheat.</P>
<P>THESE prices are not recorded on account of their extraordinary dearne&s;s or cheapne&s;s, but are mentioned accidentally as the prices actually paid for large quantities of grain con&s;umed at a fea&s;t which was famous for its magnificence.</P>
<P>IN 1262, being the 51&s;t of Henry III, was revived an ancient &s;tatute called, <HI>The A&s;&s;ize of Bread and Ale,</HI> which, the king &s;ays in the preamble, had been made in the times of his progenitors &s;ome|time kings of England. It is probably, therefore, as old at lea&s;t as the time of his grandfather Henry II, and may have been as old as the Conque&s;t. It regulates the price of bread according as the prices of wheat may happen to be, from one &s;hilling to twenty &s;hillings the quarter of the money of tho&s;e times. But &s;tatutes of this kind are generally pre&s;umed to provide with equal care for all deviations from the middle price, for tho&s;e below it as well as for tho&s;e above it. Ten &s;hillings, therefore, containing &s;ix ounces of &s;ilver Tower-weight, and equal to about thirty &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money, mu&s;t upon this &s;uppo&s;ition have been reckoned the middle price of the quarter of wheat when this &s;tatute was fir&s;t enacted, and mu&s;t have continued to be &s;o in the 51&s;t of Henry III. We cannot therefore be very far wrong in &s;uppo&s;ing that the middle price was not le&s;s than one-third of the highe&s;t price at which this &s;tatute regulates the price of bread, or than &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence of the money of tho&s;e times, containing four ounces of &s;ilver Tower-weight.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e different facts, therefore, we &s;eem to have &s;ome rea&s;on to conclude, that about the middle of the fourteenth century, and for a con&s;iderable time before, the average or ordinary price
<PB N="225" REF="238">
of the quarter of wheat was not &s;uppo&s;ed to be le&s;s than four ounces of &s;ilver Tower-weight.</P>
<P>FROM about the middle of the fourteenth to the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, what was reckoned the rea&s;onable and mode|rate, that is the ordinary or average price of wheat, &s;eems to have &s;unk gradually to about one-half of this price; &s;o as at la&s;t to have fallen to about two ounces of &s;ilver Tower-weight, equal to about ten &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money. It continued to be e&s;timated at this price till about 1570.</P>
<P>IN the hou&s;hold book of Henry, the fifth Earl of Northum|berland, drawn up in 1512, there are two different e&s;timations of wheat. In one of them it is computed at &s;ix &s;hillings and eight|pence the quarter; in the other at five &s;hillings and eight-pence only. In 1512, &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence contained only two ounces of &s;ilver Tower-weight, and were equal to about ten &s;hil|lings of our pre&s;ent money.</P>
<P>FROM the 25th of Edward III, to the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth, during the &s;pace of more than two hundred years, &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence, it appears from &s;everal different &s;tatutes, had continued to be con&s;idered as what is called the moderate and rea&s;onable, that is the ordinary or average price of wheat. The quantity of &s;ilver, however, contained in that nominal &s;um was, during the cour&s;e of this period, continually dimini&s;hing, in con|&s;equence of &s;ome alterations which were made in the coin. But the increa&s;e of the value of &s;ilver had, it &s;eems, &s;o far compen&s;ated the diminution of the quantity of it contained in the &s;ame nominal &s;um, that the legi&s;lature did not think it worth while to attend to this circum&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="239">
THUS in 1436 it was enacted, that wheat might be exported without a licence when the price was &s;o low as &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence: And in 1463 it was enacted, that no wheat &s;hould be imported if the price was not above &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence the quarter. The legi&s;lature had imagined, that when the price was &s;o low, there could be no inconveniency in exportation, but that when it ro&s;e higher, it became prudent to allow of impor|tation. Six &s;hillings and eight-pence, therefore, containing about the &s;ame quantity of &s;ilver as thirteen &s;hillings and four-pence of our pre&s;ent money, (one-third part le&s;s than the &s;ame nominal &s;um contained in the time of Edward III.), had in tho&s;e times been con|&s;idered as what is called the moderate and rea&s;onable price of wheat.</P>
<P>IN 1554, by the 1&s;t and 2d of Philip and Mary; and in 1558, by the 1&s;t of Elizabeth, the exportation of wheat was in the &s;ame manner prohibited, whenever the price of the quarter &s;hould exceed &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence, which did not then contain two penny worth more &s;ilver than the &s;ame nominal &s;um does at pre&s;ent. But it had &s;oon been found that to re&s;train the exportation of wheat till the price was &s;o very low, was, in reality, to prohibit it altoge|ther. In 1562, therefore, by the 5th of Elizabeth, the exportation of wheat was allowed from certain ports whenever the price of the quarter &s;hould not exceed ten &s;hillings, containing nearly the &s;ame quantity of &s;ilver as the like nominal &s;um does at pre&s;ent. This price had at this time, therefore, been con&s;idered as what is called the moderate and rea&s;onable price of wheat. It agrees nearly with the e&s;timation of the Northumberland book in 1512.</P>
<P>THAT in France the average price of grain was, in the &s;ame manner, much lower in the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, than in the two centuries preceeding, has
<PB N="227" REF="240">
been ob&s;erved both by Mr. Dupr&egrave; de St. Maur, and by the elegant author of the E&s;&s;ay on the police of grain. Its price, during the &s;ame period, had probably &s;unk in the &s;ame manner through the greater part of Europe.</P>
<P>THIS ri&s;e in the value of &s;ilver in proportion to that of corn, may either have been owing altogether to the increa&s;e of the demand for that metal, in con&s;equence of increa&s;ing improvement and cul|tivation, the &s;upply in the mean time continuing the &s;ame as before: Or, the demand continuing the &s;ame as before, it may have been owing altogether to the gradual diminution of the &s;upply; the greater part of the mines which were then known in the world, being much exhau&s;ted, and con&s;equently the expence of working them much increa&s;ed: Or it may have been owing partly to the one and partly to the other of tho&s;e two circum&s;tances. In the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the &s;ixteenth centuries, the greater part of Europe was approaching towards a more &s;ettled form of go|vernment than it had enjoyed for &s;everal ages before. The increa&s;e of &s;ecurity would naturally increa&s;e indu&s;try and improvement; and the demand for the precious metals, as well as for every other luxury and ornament, would naturally increa&s;e with the increa&s;e of riches. A greater annual produce would require a greater quantity of coin to circulate it; and a greater number of rich people would require a greater quantity of plate and other ornaments of &s;ilver. It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e too, that the greater part of the mines which then &s;up|plied the European market with &s;ilver, might be a good deal ex|hau&s;ted, and have become more expen&s;ive in the working. They had been wrought many of them from the time of the Romans.</P>
<P>IT has been the opinion, however, of the greater part of tho&s;e who have written upon the prices of commodities in antient times, that, from the Conque&s;t, perhaps from the inva&s;ion of
<PB N="228" REF="241">
Julius Cae&s;ar till the di&s;covery of the mines of America, the value of &s;ilver was continually dimini&s;hing. This opinion they &s;eem to have been led into, partly by the ob&s;ervations which they had occa&s;ion to make upon the prices both of corn and of &s;ome other parts of the rude produce of land; and partly by the popular notion, that as the quantity of &s;ilver naturally increa&s;es in every country with the increa&s;e of wealth, &s;o its value dimini&s;hes as its quantity increa&s;es.</P>
<P>IN their ob&s;ervations upon the prices of corn, three different cir|cum&s;tances &s;eem frequently to have mi&s;led them.</P>
<P>FIRST, In antient times almo&s;t all rents were paid in kind; in a certain quantity of corn, cattle, poultry, &amp;c. It &s;ometimes happened, however, that the landlord would &s;tipulate with the tenant, that he &s;hould be at liberty to demand either the annual payment in kind, or a certain &s;um of money in&s;tead of it. The price at which the payment in kind was in this manner exchanged for a certain &s;um of money, is in Scotland called the conver&s;ion price. As the option is always in the landlord to take either the &s;ub&s;tance or the price, it is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the tenant, that the conver&s;ion price &s;hould rather be below than above the average market price. In many places, accordingly, it is not much above one-half of this price. Through the greater part of Scotland this cu&s;tom &s;till continues with regard to poultry, and in &s;ome places with regard to cattle. It might probably have continued to take place too with regard to corn, had not the in&s;titution of the publick fiars put an end to it. The&s;e are annual valu|ations, according to the judgement of an a&s;&s;ize, of the average price of all the different &s;orts of grain, and of all the dif|ferent qualities of each, according to the actual market price in every different county. This in&s;titution rendered it &s;ufficiently &s;afe for the tenant, and much more convenient for the landlord,
<PB N="229" REF="242">
to convert, as they call it, the corn rent at the price of the fiars of each year, rather than at any certain fixed price. But the writers who have collected the prices of corn in antient times, &s;eem fre|quently to have mi&s;taken what is called in Scotland the conver&s;ion price for the actual market price. Fleetwood acknowledges upon one occa&s;ion that he had made this mi&s;take. As he wrote his book, however, for a particular purpo&s;e, he does not think proper to make this acknowledgement till after tran&s;cribing this conver&s;ion price fifteen times. The price is eight &s;hillings the quarter of wheat. This &s;um in 1423, the year at which he begins with it, contained the &s;ame quantity of &s;ilver as &s;ixteen &s;hillings of our pre|&s;ent money. But in 1562, the year at which he ends with it, it con|tained no more than the &s;ame nominal &s;um does at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, They have been mi&s;led by the &s;lovenly manner in which &s;ome antient &s;tatutes of a&s;&s;ize had been &s;ometimes tran&s;cribed by lazy copiers; and &s;ometimes perhaps actually compo&s;ed by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>THE antient &s;tatutes of a&s;&s;ize &s;eem to have begun always with de|termining what ought to be the price of bread and ale when the price of wheat and barley were at the lowe&s;t, and to have proceeded gradually to determine what it ought to be according as the prices of tho&s;e two &s;orts of grain &s;hould gradually ri&s;e above this lowe&s;t price. But the tran&s;cribers of tho&s;e &s;tatutes &s;eem frequently to have though it &s;ufficient to copy the regulation as far as the three or four fir&s;t and lowe&s;t prices; &s;aving in this manner their own labour, and judging, I &s;uppo&s;e, that this was enough to &s;how what proportion ought to be ob&s;erved in all higher prices.</P>
<P>THUS in the a&s;&s;ize of bread and ale, of the 51&s;t of Henry III. the price of bread was regulated according to the different prices of
<PB N="230" REF="243">
wheat, from one &s;hilling to twenty &s;hillings the quarter, of the money of tho&s;e times. But in the manu&s;cripts from which all the different editions of the &s;tatutes, preceeding that of Mr. Ruffhead, were printed, the copiers had never tran&s;cribed this regulation be|yond the price of twelve &s;hillings. Several writers, therefore, being mi&s;led by this faulty tran&s;cription, very naturally concluded that the middle price, or &s;ix &s;hillings the quarter, equal to about eighteen &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money, was the ordinary or average price of wheat at that time.</P>
<P>IN the &s;tatute of Tumbrel and Pillory, enacted nearly about the &s;ame time, the price of ale is regulated according to every &s;ixpence ri&s;e in the price of barley, from two &s;hillings to four &s;hillings the quarter. That four &s;hillings, however, was not con&s;idered as the highe&s;t price to which barley might frequently ri&s;e in tho&s;e times, and that the&s;e prices were only given as an example of the proportion which ought to be ob&s;erved in all other prices, whether higher or lower, we may infer from the la&s;t words of the &s;tatute; <Q>et &s;ic deinceps cre&s;cetur vel diminuetur per &s;ex denarios.</Q> The ex|pre&s;&s;ion is very &s;lovenly, but the meaning is plain enough; <Q>That the price of ale is in this manner to be increa&s;ed or di|mini&s;hed according to every &s;ixpence ri&s;e or fall in the price of barley.</Q> In the compo&s;ition of this &s;tatute the legi&s;lature it&s;elf &s;eems to have been as negligent as the copiers were in the tran&s;cription of the other.</P>
<P>IN an antient manu&s;cript of the Regiam Maje&s;tatem, an old Scotch law book, there is a &s;tatute of a&s;&s;ize, in which the price of bread is regulated according to all the different prices of wheat, from ten-pence to three &s;hillings the Scotch boll, equal to about half an Engli&s;h quarter. Three &s;hillings Scotch, at the time when this a&s;&s;ize is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been enacted, were equal to about nine
<PB N="231" REF="244">
&s;hillings &s;terling of our pre&s;ent money. Mr. Rudiman &s;eems to conclude from this, that three &s;hillings was the highe&s;t price to which wheat ever ro&s;e in tho&s;e times, and that ten-pence, a &s;hilling, or at mo&s;t two &s;hillings, were the ordinary prices. Upon con|&s;ulting the manu&s;cript, however, it appears evidently, that all the&s;e prices are only &s;et down as examples of the proportion which ought to be ob&s;erved between the re&s;pective prices of wheat and bread. The la&s;t words of the &s;tatute are, <Q>reliqua judicabis &s;ecundum prae&s;cripta habendo re&s;pectum ad pretium bladi. You &s;hall judge of the remaining ca&s;es according to what is above written, having a re&s;pect to the price of corn.</Q></P>
<P>THIRDLY, They &s;eem to have been mi&s;led too by the very low price at which wheat was &s;ometimes &s;old in very antient times; and to have imagined, that as its lowe&s;t price was then much lower than in later times, its ordinary price mu&s;t likewi&s;e have been much lower. They might have found, however, that in tho&s;e antient times, its highe&s;t price was fully as much above, as its lowe&s;t price was below any thing that had ever been known in later times. Thus in 1270, Fleetwood gives us two prices of the quarter of wheat. The one is four pounds &s;ixteen &s;hillings of the money of tho&s;e times, equal to fourteen pounds eight &s;hillings of that of the pre&s;ent; the other is &s;ix pounds eight &s;hillings, equal to nineteen pounds four &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money. No price can be found in the end of the fifteenth, or beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, which approaches to the extravagance of the&s;e. The price of corn, though at all times liable to variations, varies mo&s;t in tho&s;e tur|bulent and di&s;orderly &s;ocieties, in which the interruption of all commerce and communication hinders the plenty of one part of the country from relieving the &s;carcity of another. In the di&s;orderly &s;tate of England under the Plantagenets, who governed it from about the middle of the twelfth, till towards the end of the fifteenth
<PB N="232" REF="245">
century, one di&s;trict might be in plenty, while another at no great di&s;tance, by having its crop de&s;troyed either by &s;ome accident of the &s;ea&s;ons, or by the incur&s;ion of &s;ome neighbouring baron, might be &s;uffering all the horrors of a famine; and yet if the lands of &s;ome ho&s;tile lord were interpo&s;ed between them, the one might not be able to give the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the other. Under the vigorous ad|mini&s;tration of the Tudors, who governed England during the latter part of the fifteenth, and through the whole of the &s;ixteenth century, no baron was powerful enough to dare to di&s;turb the publick &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>THE reader will find at the end of this chapter all the prices of wheat which have been collected by Fleetwood from 1202 to 1597, both inclu&s;ive, reduced to the money of the pre&s;ent times, and dige&s;ted according to the order of time, into &s;even divi&s;ions of twelve years each. At the end of each divi&s;ion too, he will find the average price of the twelve years of which it con&s;i&s;ts. In that long period of time, Fleetwood has been able to collect the prices of no more than eighty years, &s;o that four years are wanting to make out the la&s;t twelve years. I have added, therefore, from the accounts of Eton college, the prices of 1598, 1599, 1600, and 1601. It is the only addition which I have made. The reader will &s;ee that from the beginning of the thirteenth till after the middle of the &s;ixteenth century, the average price of each twelve years grows gradually lower and lower; and that towards the end of the &s;ixteenth century it begins to ri&s;e again. The prices, indeed, which Fleetwood has been able to collect, &s;eem to have been tho&s;e chiefly which were remarkable for extraordinary dear|ne&s;s or cheapne&s;s; and I do not pretend that any very certain con|clu&s;ion can be drawn from them. So far, however, as they prove any thing at all, they confirm the account which I have been en|deavouring to give. Fleetwood him&s;elf, however, &s;eems, with mo&s;t other writers, to have believed, that during all this period the
<PB N="233" REF="246">
value of &s;ilver, in con&s;equence of its increa&s;ing abundance, was continually dimini&s;hing. The prices of corn which he him&s;elf has collected, certainly do not agree with this opinion. They agree perfectly with that of Mr. Dupr&egrave; de St. Maur, and with that which I have been endeavouring to explain. Bi&s;hop Fleetwood and Mr. Dupr&egrave; de St. Maur are the two authors who &s;eem to have collected, with the greate&s;t diligence and fidelity, the prices of things in antient times. It is &s;omewhat curious that, though their opinions are &s;o very different, their facts, &s;o far as they relate to the price of corn at lea&s;t, &s;hould coincide &s;o very exactly.</P>
<P>IT is not, however, &s;o much from the low price of corn, as from that of &s;ome other parts of the rude produce of land, that the mo&s;t judicious writers have inferred the great value of &s;ilver in tho&s;e very antient times. Corn, it has been &s;aid, being a &s;ort of manufacture, was, in tho&s;e rude ages, much dearer in proportion than the greater part of other commodities; it is meant, I &s;uppo&s;e, than the greater part of unmanufactured commodities, &s;uch as cattle, poultry, game of all kinds, &amp;c. That in tho&s;e times of poverty and barbari&s;m the&s;e were proportionably much cheaper than corn, is undoubtedly true. But this cheapne&s;s was not the effect of the high value of &s;ilver, but of the low value of tho&s;e commodities. It was not that &s;ilver would in &s;uch times purcha&s;e or repre&s;ent a greater quantity of labour, but that &s;uch commodities would purcha&s;e or repre&s;ent a much &s;maller quantity than in times of more opulence and im|provement. Silver mu&s;t certainly be cheaper in Spani&s;h America than in Europe; in the country where it is produced, than in the country to which it is brought, at the expence of a long carriage both by land and by &s;ea, of a freight and an in&s;urance. One and twenty pence halfpenny &s;terling, however, we are told by Ulloa, was, not many years ago, at Buenos Ayres, the price of an ox
<PB N="234" REF="247">
cho&s;en from a herd of three or four hundred. Sixteen &s;hillings &s;terling, we are told by Mr. Byron, was the price of a good hor&s;e in the capital of Chili. In a country naturally fertile, but of which the far greater part is altogether uncultivated, cattle, poul|try, game of all kinds, &amp;c. as they can be acquired with a very &s;mall quantity of labour, &s;o they will purcha&s;e or command but a very &s;mall quantity. The low money price for which they may be &s;old, is no proof that the real value of &s;ilver is there very high, but that the real value of tho&s;e commodities is very low.</P>
<P>LABOUR, it mu&s;t always be remembered, and not any particular commodity or &s;ett of commodities, is the real mea&s;ure of the value both of &s;ilver and of all other commodities.</P>
<P>BUT in countries almo&s;t wa&s;te, or but thinly inhabited, cattle, poultry, game of all kinds, &amp;c. as they are the &s;pontaneous pro|ductions of nature, &s;o &s;he frequently produces them in much greater quantities than the con&s;umption of the inhabitants requires. In &s;uch a &s;tate of things the &s;upply commonly exceeds the demand. In different &s;tates of &s;ociety, in different &s;tages of improvement, therefore, &s;uch commodities will repre&s;ent, or be equivalent to, very different quantities of labour.</P>
<P>IN every &s;tate of &s;ociety, in every &s;tage of improvement, corn is the production of human indu&s;try. But the average produce of every &s;ort of indu&s;try is always &s;uited, more or le&s;s exactly, to the average con&s;umption; the average &s;upply to the average demand. In every different &s;tage of improvement be&s;ides, the rai&s;ing of equal quantities of corn in the &s;ame &s;oil and climate, will, at an average, require nearly equal quantities of labour; or what comes to the &s;ame thing, the price of nearly equal quantities; the continual in|crea&s;e
<PB N="235" REF="248">
of the productive powers of labour in an improving &s;tate of cultivation, being more or le&s;s counter-balanced by the continually increa&s;ing price of cattle, the principal in&s;truments of agriculture. Upon all the&s;e accounts, therefore, we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that equal quantities of corn will, in every &s;tate of &s;ociety, in every &s;tage of improvement, more nearly repre&s;ent, or be equivalent to, equal quantities of labour, than equal quantities of any other part of the rude produce of land. Corn, accordingly, it has already been ob|&s;erved, is, in all the different &s;tages of wealth and improvement, a more accurate mea&s;ure of value than any other commodity or &s;ett of commodities. In all tho&s;e different &s;tages, therefore, we can judge better of the real value of &s;ilver, by comparing it with corn, than by comparing it with any other commodity, or &s;ett of com|modities.</P>
<P>CORN, be&s;ides, or whatever el&s;e is the common and favourite vegetable food of the people, con&s;titutes, in every civilized country, the principal part of the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the labourer. In con&s;e|quence of the exten&s;ion of agriculture, the land of every country produces a much greater quantity of vegetable than of animal food, and the labourer every where lives chiefly upon the whole&s;ome food that is cheape&s;t and mo&s;t abundant. Butcher's-meat, except in the mo&s;t thriving countries, or where labour is mo&s;t highly rewarded, makes but an in&s;ignificant part of his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: poultry makes a &s;till &s;maller part of it, and game no part of it. In France, and even in Scotland, where labour is &s;omewhat better rewarded than in France, the labouring poor &s;eldom eat butcher's-meat, except upon holidays, and other extraordi|nary occa&s;ions. The money price of labour, therefore, de|pends much more upon the average money price of corn, the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the labourer, than upon that of butcher's-meat, or of any other part of the rude produce of land. The real value of
<PB N="236" REF="249">
gold and &s;ilver, therefore, the real quantity of labour which they can purcha&s;e or command, depends much more upon the quantity of corn which they can purcha&s;e or command, than upon that of butcher's-meat, or any other part of the rude produce of land.</P>
<P>SUCH &s;light ob&s;ervations, however, upon the prices either of corn or of other commodities, would not probably have mi&s;led &s;o many intelligent authors, had they not been agreeable to the popular notion, that as the quantity of &s;ilver naturally increa&s;es in every country with the increa&s;e of wealth, &s;o its value dimini&s;hes as its quantity increa&s;es. This notion, however, &s;eems to be altogether groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>THE quantity of the precious metals may increa&s;e in any country from two different cau&s;es: either, fir&s;t, from the increa&s;ed abun|dance of the mines which &s;upply it; or, &s;econdly, from the increa&s;ed wealth of the people, from the increa&s;ed produce of their annual labour. The fir&s;t of the&s;e cau&s;es is no doubt nece&s;&s;arily connected with the diminution of the value of the precious metals; but the &s;econd is not.</P>
<P>WHEN more abundant mines are di&s;covered, a greater quantity of the precious metals is brought to market, and the quantity of the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life for which they mu&s;t be exchanged being the &s;ame as before, equal quantities of the metals mu&s;t be exchanged for &s;maller quantities of commodities. So far, therefore, as the increa&s;e of the quantity of the precious metals in any country ari&s;es from the increa&s;ed abundance of the mines, it is nece&s;&s;arily connected with &s;ome diminution of their value.</P>
<P>WHEN, on the contrary, the wealth of any country increa&s;es, when the annual produce of its labour becomes gradually greater
<PB N="237" REF="250">
and greater, a greater quantity of coin becomes nece&s;&s;ary in order to circulate a greater quantity of commodities; and the people, as they can afford it, as they have more commodities to give for it, will naturally purcha&s;e a greater and a greater quantity of plate. The quantity of their coin will increa&s;e from nece&s;&s;ity; the quantity of their plate from vanity and o&s;tentation, or from the &s;ame rea&s;on that the quantity of fine &s;tatues, pictures, and of every other luxury and curio&s;ity, is likely to encrea&s;e among them. But as &s;tatuaries and painters are not likely to be wor&s;e rewarded in times of wealth and pro&s;perity, than in times of poverty and depre&s;&s;ion, &s;o gold and &s;ilver are not likely to be wor&s;e paid for.</P>
<P>THE price of gold and &s;ilver, when the accidental di&s;covery of more abundant mines does not keep it down, as it naturally ri&s;es with the wealth of every country, &s;o, whatever be the &s;tate of the mines, it is at all times naturally higher in a rich than in a poor country. Gold and &s;ilver, like all other commodities, na|turally &s;eek the market where the be&s;t price is given for them, and the be&s;t price is commonly given for every thing in the country which can be&s;t afford it. Labour, it mu&s;t be remembered, is the ultimate price which is paid for every thing, and in countries where labour is equally well rewarded, the money price of labour will be in proportion to that of the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the labourer. But gold and &s;ilver will naturally exchange for a greater quantity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in a rich than in a poor country, in a country which abounds with &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, than in one which is but indifferently &s;up|plied with it. If the two countries are at a great di&s;tance, the dif|ference may be very great; becau&s;e though the metals naturally fly from the wor&s;e to the better market, yet it may be difficult to tran&s;port them in &s;uch quantities as to bring their price nearly to a level in both. If the countries are near, the difference will be &s;maller, and may &s;ometimes be &s;carce perceptible; becau&s;e in this
<PB N="238" REF="251">
ca&s;e the tran&s;portation will be ea&s;y. China is a much richer coun|try than any part of Europe, and the difference between the price of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in China and in Europe is very great. Rice in China is much cheaper than wheat is any where in Europe. England is a much richer country than Scotland; but the difference between the money price of corn in tho&s;e two countries is much &s;maller, and is but ju&s;t perceptible. In proportion to the quantity or mea&s;ure, Scotch corn generally appears to be a good deal cheaper than Engli&s;h; but in proportion to its quality, it is certainly &s;ome|what dearer. Scotland receives almo&s;t every year very large &s;up|plies from England, and every commodity mu&s;t commonly be &s;omewhat dearer in the country to which it is brought than in that from which it comes. Engli&s;h corn, therefore, mu&s;t be dearer in Scotland than in England, and yet in proportion to its quality, or to the quantity and goodne&s;s of the flour or meal which can be made from it, it cannot commonly be &s;old higher there than the Scotch corn which comes to market in competition with it.</P>
<P>THE difference between the money price of labour in China and in Europe, is &s;till greater than that between the money price of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; becau&s;e the real recompence of labour is higher in Europe than in China, the greater part of Europe being in an improving &s;tate, while China &s;eems to be &s;tanding &s;till. The mo|ney price of labour is lower in Scotland than in England, becau&s;e the real recompence of labour is much lower; Scotland, though advancing to greater wealth, advancing much more &s;lowly than England. The proportion between the real recompence of labour in different countries, it mu&s;t be remembered, is naturally regu|lated, not by their actual wealth or poverty, but by their advanc|ing, &s;tationary, or declining condition.</P>
<P>GOLD and &s;ilver, as they are naturally of the greate&s;t value among the riche&s;t, &s;o they are naturally of lea&s;t value among the poore&s;t
<PB N="239" REF="252">
nations. Among &s;avages, the poore&s;t of all nations, they are of &s;carce any value.</P>
<P>IN great towns corn is always dearer than in remote parts of the country. This, however, is the effect, not of the real cheap|ne&s;s of &s;ilver, but of the real dearne&s;s of corn. It does not co&s;t le&s;s labour to bring &s;ilver to the great town than to the remote parts of the country; but it co&s;ts a great deal more to bring corn.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome very rich and commercial countries, &s;uch as Hol|land and the territory of Genoa, corn is dear for the &s;ame rea&s;on that it is dear in great towns. They do not produce enough to maintain their inhabitants. They are rich in the indu&s;try and &s;kill of their artificers and manufacturers; in every &s;ort of machinery which can facilitate and abridge labour; in &s;hipping, and in all the other in&s;truments and means of carriage and commerce: but they are poor in corn, which, as it mu&s;t be brought to them from di&s;tant countries, mu&s;t, by an addition to its price, pay for the carriage from tho&s;e countries. It does not co&s;t le&s;s labour to bring &s;ilver to Am&s;terdam than to Dantzick; but it co&s;ts a great deal more to bring corn. The real co&s;t of &s;ilver mu&s;t be nearly the &s;ame in both places; but that of corn mu&s;t be very different. Dimini&s;h the real opulence either of Holland or of the territory of Genoa, while the number of their inhabitants remains the &s;ame; dimini&s;h their power of &s;upplying them&s;elves from di&s;tant countries; and the price of corn, in&s;tead of &s;inking with that diminution in the quantity of their &s;ilver, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily accompany this de|clen&s;ion either as its cau&s;e or as its effect, will ri&s;e to the price of a famine. When we are in want of nece&s;&s;aries we mu&s;t part with all &s;uperfluities, of which the value, as it ri&s;es in times of opulence and pro&s;perity, &s;o it &s;inks in times of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s. It is
<PB N="240" REF="253">
otherwi&s;e with nece&s;&s;aries. Their real price, the quantity of labour which they can purcha&s;e or command, ri&s;es in times of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;inks in times of opulence and pro&s;|perity, which are always times of great abundance; for they could not otherwi&s;e be times of opulence and pro&s;perity. Corn is a nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ilver is only a &s;uperfluity.</P>
<P>WHATEVER, therefore, may have been the increa&s;e in the quan|tity of the precious metals, which, during the period between the middle of the fourteenth and that of the &s;ixteenth century, aro&s;e from the increa&s;e of wealth and improvement, it could have no tendency to dimini&s;h their value either in Great Britain, or in any other part of Europe. If tho&s;e who have collected the prices of things in ancient times, therefore, had, during this pe|riod, no rea&s;on to infer the diminution of the value of &s;ilver, from any ob&s;ervations which they had made upon the prices either of corn or of other commodities, they had &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on to infer it from any &s;uppo&s;ed increa&s;e of wealth and improvement.</P>

<P>BUT how various &s;oever may have been the opinions of the learned concerning the progre&s;s of the value of &s;ilver during this fir&s;t period, they are unanimous concerning it during the &s;econd.</P>
<P>FROM about 1570 to about 1640, during a period of about &s;e|venty years, the variation in the proportion between the value of &s;ilver and that of corn, held a quite oppo&s;ite cour&s;e. Silver &s;unk in its real value, or would exchange for a &s;maller quantity of la|bour than before; and corn ro&s;e in its nominal price, and in&s;tead

of being commonly &s;old for about two ounces of &s;ilver the quarter, or about ten &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money, came to be &s;old for &s;ix and eight ounces of &s;ilver the quarter, or about thirty and forty &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money.</P>
<P>THE di&s;covery of the abundant mines of America, &s;eems to have been the &s;ole cau&s;e of this diminution in the value of &s;ilver in pro|portion to that of corn. It is accounted for accordingly in the &s;ame manner by every body; and there never has been any di&s;pute either about the fact, or about the cau&s;e of it. The greater part of Europe was, during this period, advancing in indu&s;try and im|provement, and the demand for &s;ilver mu&s;t con&s;equently have been increa&s;ing. But the increa&s;e of the &s;upply had, it &s;eems, &s;o far exceeded that of the demand, that the value of that metal &s;unk con&s;iderably. The di&s;covery of the mines of America, it is to be ob&s;erved, does not &s;eem to have had any very &s;en&s;ible effect upon the prices of things in England till after 1570; though even the mines of Poto&s;i had been di&s;covered more than thirty years before.</P>
<P>FROM 1595 to 1620, both inclu&s;ive, the average price of the quarter of nine bu&s;hels of the be&s;t wheat at Wind&s;or market, ap|pears, from the accounts of Eton College, to have been 2l. 1s. 6d. 9/13.

And from this &s;um, neglecting likewi&s;e the fraction, and deducting a ninth, or 4s. 1d. 1/9, for the difference between the price of the be&s;t wheat, and that of the middle wheat, the price of the middle wheat comes out to have been about 1l. 12s. 8d. 8/9, or about &s;ix ounces and one|third of an ounce of &s;ilver.</P>

<HEAD>THIRD PERIOD.</HEAD>
<P>BETWEEN 1630 and 1640, or about 1636, the effect of the di&s;covery of the mines of America in reducing the value of &s;ilver, appears to have been compleated, and the value of that metal &s;eems never to have &s;unk lower in proportion to that of corn than it was about that time. It &s;eems to have ri&s;en &s;omewhat in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century, and it had probably begun to do &s;o even &s;ome time before the end of the la&s;t.</P>
<P>FROM 1637 to 1700, both inclu&s;ive, being the &s;ixty-four la&s;t years of the la&s;t century, the average price of the quarter of nine bu&s;hels of the be&s;t wheat at Wind&s;or market, appears, from the &s;ame accounts, to have been 2 l. 11 s. od. &frac13;; which is only 1 s. od. &frac13; dearer than it had been during the &s;ixteen years before. But in the cour&s;e of the&s;e &s;ixty-four years there happened two events which mu&s;t have produced a much greater &s;carcity of corn than what the cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;ons would otherwi&s;e have occa&s;ioned, and which, therefore, without &s;uppo&s;ing any further reduction in the value of &s;ilver, will much more than account for this very &s;mall enhancement of price.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e events was the civil war, which, by di&s;courag|ing tillage and interrupting commerce, mu&s;t have rai&s;ed the price
<PB N="243" REF="256">
of corn much above what the cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;ons would otherwi&s;e have occa&s;ioned. It mu&s;t have had this effect more or le&s;s at all the different markets in the kingdom, but particularly at tho&s;e in the neighbourhood of London, which require to be &s;upplied from the greate&s;t di&s;tance. In 1648, accordingly, the price of the be&s;t wheat at Wind&s;or market, appears, from the &s;ame accounts, to have been 4 l. 5 s. and in 1649 to have been 4 l. the quarter of nine bu&s;hels. The exce&s;s of tho&s;e two years above 2 l. 10 s. (the average price of the &s;ixteen years preceding 1637) is 3 l. 5 s.; which divided among the &s;ixty-four la&s;t years of the la&s;t century, will alone very nearly account for that &s;mall enhancement of price which &s;eems to have taken place in them. The&s;e, however, though the highe&s;t, are by no means the only high prices which &s;eem to have been occa&s;ioned by the civil wars.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd event was the bounty upon the exportation of corn granted in 1688. The bounty, it has been thought by many people, by encouraging tillage, may, in a long cour&s;e of years, have occa&s;ioned a greater abundance, and con&s;equently a greater cheapne&s;s of corn in the home-market than what would otherwi&s;e have taken place there. But between 1688 and 1700, it had no time to produce this effect. During this &s;hort period its only ef|fect mu&s;t have been, by encouraging the exportation of the &s;urplus produce of every year, and thereby hindering the abundance of one year from compen&s;ating the &s;carcity of another, to rai&s;e the price in the home-market. The &s;carcity which prevailed in Eng|land from 1693 to 1699, both inclu&s;ive, though no doubt prin|cipally owing to the badne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;ons, and, therefore, extend|ing through a con&s;iderable part of Europe, mu&s;t have been &s;ome|what enhanced by the bounty. In 1699, accordingly, the further exportation of corn was prohibited for nine months.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="257">
THERE was a third event which occurred in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame period, and which, though it could not occa&s;ion any &s;carcity of corn, nor, perhaps, any augmentation in the real quantity of &s;ilver which was u&s;ually paid for it, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have occa|&s;ioned &s;ome augmentation in the nominal &s;um. This event was the great degradation of the &s;ilver coin, by clipping and wearing. This evil had begun in the reign of Charles II. and had gone on continually increa&s;ing till 1695; at which time, as we may learn from Mr. Lowndes, the current &s;ilver coin was at an average, near five and twenty per cent. below its &s;tandard value. But the nomi|nal &s;um which con&s;titutes the market price of every commodity is nece&s;&s;arily regulated, not &s;o much by the quantity of &s;ilver, which, according to the &s;tandard, ought to be contained in it, as by that which, it is found by experience, actually is contained in it. This nominal &s;um, therefore, is nece&s;&s;arily higher when the coin is much degraded by clipping and wearing, than when near to its &s;tandard value.</P>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century, the &s;ilver coin has not at any time been more below its &s;tandard weight than it is at pre&s;ent. But though very much defaced, its value has been kept up by that of the gold coin for which it is exchanged. For though before the late re-coinage, the gold coin was a good deal defaced too, it was le&s;s &s;o than the &s;ilver. In 1695, on the contrary, the value of the &s;ilver coin was not kept up by the gold coin; a guinea then commonly exchanging for thirty &s;hillings of the worn and clipt &s;ilver. Before the late re-coinage of the gold, the price of &s;ilver bullion was &s;eldom higher than five &s;hillings and &s;even-pence an ounce, which is but five-pence above the mint price. But in 1695, the common price of &s;ilver bullion was &s;ix &s;hillings and five-pence an ounce, which is fifteen-pence above the mint price. Even be|fore the late re-coinage of the gold, therefore, the coin, gold and
<PB N="245" REF="258">
&s;ilver together, when compared with &s;ilver bullion, was not &s;up|po&s;ed to be more than eight per cent. below its &s;tandard value. In 1695, on the contrary, it had been &s;uppo&s;ed to be near five and twenty per cent. below that value. But in the be|ginning of the pre&s;ent century, that is immediately after the great re-coinage in King William's time, the greater part of the current &s;ilver coin mu&s;t have been &s;till nearer to its &s;tandard weight than it is at pre&s;ent. In the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century too there has been no great publick calamity, &s;uch as the civil war, which could either di&s;courage tillage or interrupt the interior commerce of the country. And though the bounty, which has taken place through the greater part of this century, mu&s;t always rai&s;e the price of corn &s;omewhat higher than it otherwi&s;e would be in the actual &s;tate of tillage; yet, as in the cour&s;e of this century the bounty has had full time to produce all the good effects commonly imputed to it, to en|courage tillage, and thereby to increa&s;e the quantity of corn in the home market, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have done &s;omething to lower the price of that commodity the one way, as well as to rai&s;e it the other. It is by many people &s;uppo&s;ed to have done more; a notion which I &s;hall examine hereafter. In the &s;ixty|four fir&s;t years of the pre&s;ent century accordingly, the average price of the quarter of nine bu&s;hels of the be&s;t wheat at Wind&s;or market, appears, by the accounts of Eton College, to have been 2l. 0s. 6d. 10/32, which is about ten &s;hillings and &s;ixpence, or more than five and twenty per cent. cheaper than it had been during the &s;ixty-four la&s;t years of the la&s;t century; and about nine &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence cheaper than it had been during the &s;ix|teen years preceeding 1636, when the di&s;covery of the abundant mines of America may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have produced its full effect; and about one &s;hilling cheaper than it had been in the twenty-&s;ix years preceeding 1620, before that di&s;covery can well be &s;uppo&s;ed to have produced its full effect. According to this account, the
<PB N="246" REF="259">
average price of middle wheat, during the&s;e &s;ixty-four fir&s;t years of the pre&s;ent century, comes out to have been about thirty-two &s;hillings the quarter of eight bu&s;hels.</P>
<P>THE value of &s;ilver, therefore, &s;eems to have ri&s;en &s;omewhat in proportion to that of corn during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century, and it had probably begun to do &s;o even &s;ome time before the end of the la&s;t.</P>
<P>IN 1687, the price of the quarter of nine bu&s;hels of the be&s;t wheat at Wind&s;or market was 1l. 5s. 2d. the lowe&s;t price at which it had ever been from 1595.</P>
<P>IN 1688, Mr. Gregory King, a man famous for his know|ledge in matters of this kind, e&s;timated the average price of wheat in years of moderate plenty to be to the grower 3s. 6d. the bu&s;hel, or eight and twenty &s;hillings the quarter. The grow|er's price I under&s;tand to be the &s;ame with what is &s;ometimes called the contract price, or the price at which a farmer contracts for a certain number of years to deliver a certain quantity of corn to a dealer. As a contract of this kind &s;aves the farmer the ex|pence and trouble of marketing, the contract price is generally lower than what is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the average market price. Mr. King had judged eight and twenty &s;hillings the quarter to be at that time the ordinary contract price in years of moderate plenty. Before the &s;carcity occa&s;ioned by the late extraordinary cour&s;e of bad &s;ea&s;ons, it was the ordinary contract price in all common years.</P>
<P>IN 1688 was granted the parliamentary bounty upon the ex|portation of corn. The country gentlemen, who then compo&s;ed a &s;till greater proportion of the legi&s;lature than they do at pre&s;ent,
<PB N="247" REF="260">
had felt that the money price of corn was falling. The bounty was an expedient to rai&s;e it artificially to the high price at which it had frequently been &s;old in the times of Charles I. and II. It was to take place, therefore, till wheat was &s;o high as forty-eight &s;hillings the quarter; that is twenty &s;hillings, or 5/7ths dearer than Mr. King had in that very year e&s;timated the grower's price to be in times of moderate plenty. If his calculations de&s;erve any part of the reputation which they have obtained very univer&s;ally, eight and forty &s;hillings the quarter was a price which, without &s;ome &s;uch expedient as the bounty, could not at that time be expected, except in years of extraordinary &s;carcity. But the government of king William was not then fully &s;ettled. It was in no condition to refu&s;e any thing to the country gentlemen, from whom it was at that very time &s;oliciting the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the annual land-tax.</P>
<P>THE value of &s;ilver, therefore, in proportion to that of corn, had probably ri&s;en &s;omewhat before the end of the la&s;t century; and it &s;eems to have continued to do &s;o during the cour&s;e of the greater part of the pre&s;ent; though the nece&s;&s;ary operation of the bounty mu&s;t have hindered that ri&s;e from being &s;o &s;en&s;ible as it otherwi&s;e would have been in the actual &s;tate of tillage.</P>
<P>IN plentiful years the bounty, by occa&s;ioning an extraordinary exportation, nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;es the price of corn above what it otherwi&s;e would be in tho&s;e years. To encourage tillage, by keep|ing up the price of corn even in the mo&s;t plentiful years, was the avowed end of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>IN years of great &s;carcity, indeed, the bounty has generally been &s;u&s;pended. It mu&s;t, however, have had &s;ome effect event upon the prices of many of tho&s;e years. By the extraordinary
<PB N="248" REF="261">
exportation which it occa&s;ions in years of plenty, it mu&s;t fre|quently hinder the plenty of one year from compen&s;ating the &s;carcity of another.</P>
<P>BOTH in years of plenty and in years of &s;carcity, therefore, the bounty rai&s;es the price of corn above what it naturally would be in the actual &s;tate of tillage. If during the &s;ixty-four fir&s;t years of the pre&s;ent century, therefore, the average price has been lower than during the &s;ixty-four la&s;t years of the la&s;t century, it mu&s;t, in the &s;ame &s;tate of tillage, have been much more &s;o, had it not been for this operation of the bounty.</P>
<P>BUT without the bounty, it may be &s;aid, the &s;tate of tillage would not have been the &s;ame. What may have been the effects of this in&s;titution upon the agriculture of the country, I &s;hall endeavour to explain hereafter, when I come to treat particularly of bounties. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve at pre&s;ent, that this ri&s;e in the value of &s;ilver, in proportion to that of corn, has not been peculiar to England. It has been ob&s;erved to have taken place in France during the &s;ame period, and nearly in the &s;ame pro|portion too, by three very faithful, diligent, and laborious col|lectors of the prices of corn, Mr. Dupr&egrave; de St. Maur, Mr. Me&s;&s;ance, and the author of the E&s;&s;ay on the police of grain. But in France, till 1764, the exportation of grain was by law prohibited; and it is &s;omewhat difficult to &s;uppo&s;e that nearly the &s;ame diminution of price which took place in one country, not|with&s;tanding this prohibition, &s;hould in another be owing to the extraordinary encouragement given to exportation.</P>
<P>IT would be more proper perhaps to con&s;ider this variation in the average money price of corn as the effect rather of &s;ome gradual ri&s;e in the real value of &s;ilver in the European market,
<PB N="249" REF="262">
than of any fall in the real average value of corn. Corn, it has already been ob&s;erved, is at di&s;tant periods of time a more accurate mea&s;ure of value than either &s;ilver or perhaps any other commo|dity. When after the di&s;covery of the abundant mines of America, corn ro&s;e to three and four times its former money price, this change was univer&s;ally a&s;cribed, not to any ri&s;e in the real value of corn, but to a fall in the real value of &s;ilver. If during the &s;ixty-four fir&s;t years of the pre&s;ent century, therefore, the average money price of corn has fallen &s;omewhat below what it had been during the greater part of the la&s;t century, we &s;hould in the &s;ame manner impute this change, not to any fall in the real value of corn, but to &s;ome ri&s;e in the real value of &s;ilver in the European market.</P>
<P>THE high price of corn during the&s;e ten or twelve years pa&s;t, indeed, has occa&s;ioned a &s;u&s;picion that the real value of &s;ilver &s;till continues to fall in the European market. This high price of corn, however, &s;eems evidently to have been the effect of the extra|ordinary unfavourablene&s;s of the &s;ea&s;ons, and ought therefore to be regarded, not as a permanent, but as a tran&s;itory and occa&s;ional event. The &s;ea&s;ons for the&s;e ten or twelve years pa&s;t have been unfavourable through the greater part of Europe; and the di&s;|orders of Poland have very much increa&s;ed the &s;carcity in all tho&s;e countries, which in dear years u&s;ed to be &s;upplied from that market. So long a cour&s;e of bad &s;ea&s;ons, though not a very common event, is by no means a &s;ingular one; and whoever has enquired much into the hi&s;tory of the prices of corn in former times, will be at no lo&s;s to recollect &s;everal other examples of the &s;ame kind. Ten years of extraordinary &s;carcity, be&s;ides, are not more wonderful than ten years of extraordinary plenty. The low price of corn from 1741 to 1750, both inclu&s;ive, may very well be &s;et in oppo&s;ition to its high price during the&s;e la&s;t eight or ten years. From 1741 to 1750, the average price of the quarter of
<PB N="250" REF="263">
nine bu&s;hels of the be&s;t wheat at Wind&s;or market, it appears from the accounts of Eton College, was only 1l. 138. 9&frac45;d. which is nearly 6s. 3d. below the average price of the &s;ixty-four fir&s;t years of the pre&s;ent century. The average price of the quarter of eight bu&s;hels of middle wheat, comes out, according to this account, to have been, during the&s;e ten years, only 1l. 6s. 8d.</P>
<P>BETWEEN 1741 and 1750, however, the bounty mu&s;t have hindered the price of corn from falling &s;o low in the home market as it naturally would have done. During the&s;e ten years the quantity of all &s;orts of grain exported, it appears from the cu&s;|tom-hou&s;e books, amounted to no le&s;s than eight millions twenty|nine thou&s;and one hundred and fifty-&s;ix quarters one bu&s;hel. The bounty paid for this amounted to 1,514,9621. 17s. 4&frac12;d. In 1749 accordingly, Mr. Pelham, at that time prime mini&s;ter, ob&s;erved to the Hou&s;e of Commons, that for the three years pre|ceeding a very extraordinary &s;um had been paid as bounty for the exportation of corn. He had good rea&s;on to make this ob&s;er|vation, and in the following year, he might have had &s;till better. In that &s;ingle year the bounty paid amounted to no le&s;s than 324,1761. 10s. 6d. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve how much this forced exportation mu&s;t have rai&s;ed the price of corn above what it otherwi&s;e would have been in the home market.</P>
<P>AT the end of the accounts annexed to this chapter the reader will find the particular account of tho&s;e ten years &s;eparated from the re&s;t. He will find there too the particular account of the preceeding ten years, of which the average is likewi&s;e below, tho' not &s;o much below, the general average of the &s;ixty-four fir&s;t years of the century. The year 1740, however, was a year of extraordinary &s;carcity. The&s;e twenty years preceeding 1750, may very well be &s;et in oppo&s;ition to the twenty preceeding 1770. As
<PB N="251" REF="264">
the former were a good deal below the general average of the century, notwith&s;tanding the intervention of one or two dear years; &s;o the latter have been a good deal above it, notwith&s;tanding the intervention of one or two cheap ones, of 1759, for example. If the former have not been as much below the general average, as the latter have been above it, we ought probably to impute it to the bounty. The change has evidently been too &s;udden to be a&s;cribed to any change in the value of &s;ilver, which is always &s;low and gradual. The &s;uddenne&s;s of the effect can be accounted for only by a cau&s;e which can operate &s;uddenly, the accidental variation of the &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE money price of labour in Great Britain has, indeed, ri&s;en during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century. This, however, &s;eems to be the effect, not &s;o much of any diminution in the value of &s;ilver in the European market, as of an increa&s;e in the demand for labour in Great Britain, ari&s;ing from the great, and almo&s;t univer&s;al pro&s;perity of the country. In France, a country not altogether &s;o pro&s;perous, the money price of labour has, &s;ince the middle of the la&s;t century, been ob&s;erved to &s;ink gradually with the average money price of corn. Both in the la&s;t century and in the pre&s;ent, the day-wages of common labour are there &s;aid to have been pretty uniformly about the twentieth part of the ave|rage price of the &s;eptier of wheat, a mea&s;ure which contains a little more than four Winche&s;ter bu&s;hels. In Great Britain the real recompence of labour, it has already been &s;hown, the real quantity of the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life which are given to the labourer, has increa&s;ed con&s;iderably during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century. The ri&s;e in its money price &s;eems to have been the effect, not of any diminution of the value of &s;ilver in the general market of Europe, but of a ri&s;e in the real
<PB N="252" REF="265">
price of labour in the particular market of Great Britain, owing to the peculiarly happy circum&s;tances of the country.</P>
<P>FOR &s;ome time after the fir&s;t di&s;covery of America, &s;ilver would continue to &s;ell at its former, or not much below its former price. The profits of mining would for &s;ome time be very great, and much above their natural rate. Tho&s;e who imported that metal into Europe, however, would &s;oon find that the whole annual importation could not be di&s;po&s;ed of at this high price. Silver would gra|dually exchange for a &s;maller and a &s;maller quantity of goods. Its price would &s;ink gradually lower and lower till it fell to its natural price; or to what was ju&s;t &s;ufficient to pay, according to their natural rates, the wages of the labour, the profits of the &s;tock, and the rent of the land, which mu&s;t be paid in order to bring it from the mine to the market. In the greater part of the &s;ilver mines of Peru, the tax of the king of Spain, amount|ing to a fifth of the gro&s;s produce, eats up, it has already been ob&s;erved, the whole rent of the land. This tax was originally a half; it &s;oon afterwards fell to a third, and then to a fifth, at which rate it &s;till continues. In the greater part of the &s;ilver mines of Peru this, it &s;eems, is all that remains after replacing the &s;tock of the undertaker of the work, together with its ordinary profits; and it &s;eems to be univer&s;ally acknowledged that the&s;e profits, which were once very high, are now as low as they can well be, con&s;i&s;tently with carrying on the works.</P>
<P>THE tax of the king of Spain was reduced to a fifth part of the regi&s;tered &s;ilver in 1504, one and thirty years before 1535, the date of the di&s;covery of the mines of Poto&s;i. In the cour&s;e of a century, or before 1636, the&s;e mines, the mo&s;t fertile in all America, had time &s;ufficient to produce their full effect, or to reduce the value of &s;ilver in the European market as low as it
<PB N="253" REF="266">
could well fall, while it continued to pay this tax to the king of Spain. A hundred years is time &s;ufficient to reduce any com|modity, of which there is no monopoly, to its natural price, or to the lowe&s;t price at which, while it pays a particular tax, it can continue to be &s;old for any con&s;iderable time together.</P>
<P>THE price of &s;ilver in the European market might perhaps have fallen &s;till lower, and it might have become nece&s;&s;ary either to lower the tax upon it, in the &s;ame manner as that upon gold, or to give up working the greater part of the American mines which are now wrought. The gradual increa&s;e of the demand for &s;ilver, or the gradual enlargement of the market for the pro|duce of the &s;ilver mines of America, is probably the cau&s;e which has prevented this from happening, and which has not only kept up the value of &s;ilver in the European market, but has per|haps even rai&s;ed it &s;omewhat higher than it was about the middle of the la&s;t century.</P>
<P>SINCE the fir&s;t di&s;covery of America, the market for the pro|duce of its &s;ilver mines has been growing gradually more and more exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>FIRST, The market of Europe has become gradually more and more exten&s;ive. Since the di&s;covery of America, the greater part of Europe has been much improved. England, Holland, France, and Germany; even Sweden, Denmark, and Ru&s;&s;ia, have all ad|vanced con&s;iderably both in agriculture and in manufactures. Italy, &s;eems not to have gone backwards. The fall of Italy preceeded the conque&s;t of Peru. Since that time it &s;eems rather to have recovered a little. Spain and Portugal, indeed, are &s;uppo&s;ed to have gone backwards. Portugal, however, is but a very &s;mall part of Europe, and the declen&s;ion of Spain is not, perhaps, &s;o
<PB N="254" REF="267">
great as is commonly imagined. In the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, Spain was a very poor country, even in compari&s;on with France, which has been &s;o much improved &s;ince that time. It was the well known remark of the Emperor Charles V, who had travelled &s;o frequently through both countries, that every thing abounded in France, but that every thing was wanting in Spain. The increa&s;ing produce of the agriculture and manufactures of Europe mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have required a gradual increa&s;e in the quantity of &s;ilver coin to circulate it; and the increa&s;ing number of wealthy individuals mu&s;t have required the like increa&s;e in the quantity of their plate and other ornaments of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, America is it&s;elf a new market for the produce of its own &s;ilver mines; and as its advances in agriculture, indu&s;try, and population, are much more rapid than tho&s;e of the mo&s;t thriving countries in Europe, its demand mu&s;t increa&s;e much more rapidly. The Engli&s;h colonies are altogether a new market, which, partly for coin and partly for plate, requires a continually augmenting &s;upply of &s;ilver through a great continent where there never was any demand before. The greater part too of the Spani&s;h and Portugue&s;e colonies are altogether new markets. New Gra|nada, the Yucatan, Paraguay, and the Brazils were, before di&s;co|vered by the Europeans, inhabited by &s;avage nations, who had neither arts nor agriculture. A con&s;iderable degree of both has now been introduced into all of them. Even Mexico and Peru, though they cannot be con&s;idered as altogether new markets, are certainly much more exten&s;ive ones than they ever were before. After all the wonderful tales which have been publi&s;hed concern|ing the &s;plendid &s;tate of tho&s;e countries in antient times, whoever reads, with any degree of &s;ober judgement, the hi&s;tory of their fir&s;t di&s;covery and conque&s;t, will evidently di&s;cern that, in arts, agri|culture and commerce, their inhabitants were much more ignorant
<PB N="255" REF="268">
than the Tartars of the Ukraine are at pre&s;ent. Even the Peru|vians, the more civilized nation of the two, though they made u&s;e of gold and &s;ilver as ornaments, had no coined money of any kind. Their whole commerce was carried on by barter, and there was accordingly &s;carce any divi&s;ion of labour among them. Tho&s;e who cultivated the ground were obliged to build their own hou&s;es, to make their own hou&s;hold furniture, their own cloaths, &s;hoes, and in&s;truments of agriculture. The few artificers among them are &s;aid to have been all maintained by the &s;overeign, the nobles, and the prie&s;ts, and were probably their &s;ervants or &s;laves. All the ancient arts of Mexico and Peru have never furni&s;hed one &s;ingle manufacture to Europe. The Spani&s;h armies, though they &s;carce ever exceeded five hundred men, and frequently did not amount to half that number, found almo&s;t every where great difficulty in procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The famines which they are &s;aid to have occa&s;ioned almo&s;t wherever they went, in countries too which at the &s;ame time are repre&s;ented as very populous and well cultivated, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate that the &s;tory of this populou&s;ne&s;s and high cultivation is in a great mea&s;ure fabulous. The Spani&s;h colonies are under a government in many re&s;pects le&s;s favourable to agricul|ture, improvement, and population, than that of the Engli&s;h colonies. They &s;eem, however, to be advancing in all the&s;e much more rapidly than any country in Europe. In a fertile &s;oil and happy climate, the great abundance and cheapne&s;s of land, a cir|cum&s;tance common to all new colonies, is, it &s;eems, &s;o great an advantage as to compen&s;ate many defects in civil government. Frezier, who vi&s;ited Peru in 1713, repre&s;ents Lima as containing between twenty-five and twenty-eight thou&s;and inhabitants. Ulloa, who re&s;ided in the &s;ame country between 1740 and 1746, repre|&s;ents it as containing more than fifty thou&s;and. The difference in their accounts of the populou&s;ne&s;s of &s;everal other principal towns in Chili and Peru is nearly the &s;ame; and as there &s;eems to be no
<PB N="256" REF="269">
rea&s;on to doubt of the good information of either, it marks an increa&s;e which is &s;carce inferior to that of the Engli&s;h colonies. America, therefore, is a new market for the produce of its own &s;ilver mines, of which the demand mu&s;t increa&s;e much more rapidly than that of the mo&s;t thriving country in Europe.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, The Ea&s;t-Indies is another market for the produce of the &s;ilver mines of America, and a market which, from the time of the fir&s;t di&s;covery of tho&s;e mines, has been continually taking off a greater and a greater quantity of &s;ilver. Since that time, the direct trade between America and the Ea&s;t-Indies, which is carried on by means of the Acapulco &s;hips, has been continually augmenting, and the indirect intercour&s;e by the way of Europe has been augmenting in a &s;till greater proportion. During the &s;ixteenth century, the Portugue&s;e were the only European nation who carried on any regular trade to the Ea&s;t-Indies. In the la&s;t years of that century the Dutch began to encroach upon this monopoly, and in a few years expelled them from their principal &s;ettlements in India. During the greater part of the la&s;t century tho&s;e two nations divided the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the Ea&s;t-India trade between them; the trade of the Dutch continually augmenting in a &s;till greater proportion than that of the Portugue&s;e declined. The Engli&s;h and French carried on &s;ome trade with India in the la&s;t century, but it has been greatly augmented in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent. The Ea&s;t-India trade of the Swedes and Danes began in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century. Even the Mu&s;|covites now trade regularly with China by a &s;ort of caravans which go over land through Siberia and Tartary to Pekin. The Ea&s;t-India trade of all the&s;e nations, if we except that of the French, which the la&s;t war had well nigh annihilated, has been almo&s;t con|tinually augmenting. The increa&s;ing con&s;umption of Ea&s;t-India goods in Europe is, it &s;eems, &s;o great as to afford a gradual in|crea&s;e
<PB N="257" REF="270">
of employment to them all. Tea, for example, was a drug very little u&s;ed in Europe before the middle of the la&s;t century. At pre&s;ent the value of the tea annually imported by the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India Company, for the u&s;e of their own countrymen, amounts to more than a million and a half a year; and even this is not enough; a great deal more being con&s;tantly &s;muggled into the country from the ports of Holland, from Gottenburg in Sweden, and from the coa&s;t of France too as long as the French Ea&s;t-India Company was in pro&s;perity. The con&s;umption of the porcelain of China, of the &s;piceries of the Moluccas, of the piece goods of Bengal, and of innumerable other articles, has increa&s;ed very nearly in a like proportion. The tunnage accordingly of all the European &s;hipping employed in the Ea&s;t-India trade at any one time during the la&s;t century, was not, perhaps, much greater than that of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India Company before the late reduc|tion of their &s;hipping.</P>
<P>BUT in the Ea&s;t Indies, particularly in China and Indo&s;tan, the value of the precious metals, when the Europeans fir&s;t began to trade to tho&s;e countries, was much higher than in Europe; and it &s;till continues to be &s;o. In rice countries, which generally yield two, &s;ometimes three crops in the year, each of them more plen|tiful than any common crop of corn, the abundance of food mu&s;t be much greater than in any corn country of equal extent. Such countries are accordingly much more populous. In them too the rich, having a greater &s;uper-abundance of food to di&s;po&s;e of beyond what they them&s;elves can con&s;ume, have the means of purcha&s;ing a much greater quantity of the labour of other people. The retinue of a grandee in China or Indo&s;tan accordingly is, by all accounts, much more numerous and &s;plendid than that of the riche&s;t &s;ubjects in Europe. The &s;ame &s;uper-abundance of food, of which they have the di&s;po&s;al, enables them to give a greater quantity of it for all tho&s;e &s;ingular and rare productions which nature furni&s;hes
<PB N="258" REF="271">
but in very &s;mall quantities; &s;uch as the precious metals and the precious &s;tones, the great objects of the competition of the rich. Though the mines, therefore, which &s;upplied the Indian market had been as abundant as tho&s;e which &s;upplied the European, &s;uch commodities would naturally exchange for a greater quantity of food in India than in Europe. But the mines which &s;upplied the Indian market with the precious metals &s;eem to have been a good deal le&s;s abundant, and tho&s;e which &s;upplied it with the precious &s;tones a good deal more &s;o, than the mines which &s;upplied the European. The precious metals therefore would naturally exchange for &s;omewhat a greater quantity of the precious &s;tones, and for a much greater quantity of food in India than in Europe. The money price of diamonds, the greate&s;t of all &s;uperfluities, would be &s;omewhat lower, and that of food, the fir&s;t of all nece&s;&s;aries, a great deal lower in the one country than in the other. But the real price of labour, the real quantity of the nece&s;&s;aries of life which is given to the labourer, it has already been ob&s;erved, is lower both in China and Indo&s;tan, the two great markets of India, than it is through the greater part of Europe. The wages of the labourer will there purcha&s;e a &s;maller quantity of food; and as the money price of food is much lower in India than in Europe, the money price of labour is there lower upon a double account; upon accout both of the &s;mall quantity of food which it will purcha&s;e, and of the low price of that food. But in countries of equal art and indu&s;try, the money price of the greater part of manufactures will be in proportion to the money price of labour; and in manu|facturing art and indu&s;try, China and Indo&s;tan, tho' inferior, &s;eem not to be much inferior to any part of Europe. The money price of the greater part of manufactures, therefore, will naturally be much lower in tho&s;e great empires than it is any where in Europe. Through the greater part of Europe too the expence of land-car|riage increa&s;es very much both the real and nominal price of mo&s;t
<PB N="259" REF="272">
manufactures. It co&s;ts more labour, and therefore more money, to bring fir&s;t the materials, and afterwards the compleat manufacture to market. In China and Indo&s;tan the extent and variety of inland navigations &s;ave the greater part of this labour, and con&s;equently of this money, and thereby reduce &s;till lower both the real and the nominal price of the greater part of their manufactures. Upon all the&s;e accounts, the precious metals are a commodity which it always has been, and &s;till continues to be, extremely advantageous to carry from Europe to India. There is &s;carce any commodity which brings a better price there; or which, in proportion to the quantity of labour and commodities which it co&s;ts in Europe, will purcha&s;e or command a greater quantity of labour and commodities in India. It is more advantageous too to carry &s;ilver thither than gold; becau&s;e in China, and the greater part of the other markets of India, the proportion between fine &s;ilver and fine gold is but as ten to one; whereas in Europe it is as fourteen or fifteen to one. In China, and the greater part of the other markets of India, ten ounces of &s;ilver will purcha&s;e an ounce of gold: in Europe it requires from fourteen to fifteen ounces. In the cargoes, there|fore, of the greater part of European &s;hips which &s;ail to India, &s;ilver has generally been one of the mo&s;t valuable articles. It is the mo&s;t valuable article in the Acapulco &s;hips which &s;ail to Manilla. The &s;ilver of the new continent &s;eems in this manner to be the principal commodity by which the commerce between the two extremities of the old one is carried on, and it is by means of it chiefly that tho&s;e di&s;tant parts of the world are connected with one another.</P>
<P>IN order to &s;upply &s;o very widely extended a market, the quan|tity of &s;ilver annually brought from the mines mu&s;t not only be &s;ufficient to &s;upport that continual increa&s;e both of coin and of plate which is required in all thriving countries; but to repair that
<PB N="260" REF="273">
continual wa&s;te and con&s;umption of &s;ilver which takes place in all countries where that metal is u&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE continual con&s;umption of the precious metals in coin by wearing, and in plate both by wearing and cleaning, is very &s;en|&s;ible; and in commodities of which the u&s;e is &s;o very widely extended, would alone require a very great annual &s;upply. The con&s;umption of tho&s;e metals in &s;ome particular manufactures, though it may not perhaps be greater upon the whole than this gradual con&s;umption, is, however, much more &s;en&s;ible, as it is much more rapid. In the manufactures of Birmingham alone, the quantity of gold and &s;ilver annually employed in gilding and plating, and thereby di&s;qualified from ever afterwards appearing in the &s;hape of tho&s;e metals, is &s;aid to amount to more than fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. We may from thence form &s;ome notion how great mu&s;t be the annual con&s;umption in all the different parts of the world, either in manufactures of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e of Birmingham, or in laces, embroideries, gold and &s;ilver &s;tuffs, the gilding of books, furniture, &amp;c. A con&s;iderable quan|tity too mu&s;t be annually lo&s;t in tran&s;porting tho&s;e metals from one place to another both by &s;ea and by land. In the greater part of the governments of A&s;ia, be&s;ides, the almo&s;t univer&s;al cu&s;tom of concealing trea&s;ures in the bowels of the earth, of which the knowledge frequently dies with the per&s;on who makes the conceal|ment, mu&s;t occa&s;ion the lo&s;s of a &s;till greater quantity.</P>
<P>THE quantity of gold and &s;ilver imported at both Cadiz and Li&s;bon (including not only what comes under regi&s;ter, but what may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;muggled) amounts, according to the be&s;t accounts, to about &s;ix millions &s;terling a year.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="274">
ACCORDING to Mr. Meggens the annual importation of the precious metals into Spain, at an average of &s;ix years; viz. from 1748 to 1753, both inclu&s;ive; and into Portugal, at an average of &s;even years; viz. from 1747 to 1753, both inclu&s;ive; amounted in &s;ilver to 1,101,107 pounds weight; and in gold to 49,940 pounds weight. The &s;ilver, at &s;ixty-two &s;hillings the pound Troy, amounts to 3,413,431 l. 10s. &s;terling. The gold, at forty-four guineas and a half the pound Troy, amounts to 2,333,446l. 14s. &s;terling. Both together amount to 5,746,878l. 4s. &s;terling. The account of what was imported under regi&s;ter, he a&s;&s;ures us is exact. He gives us the detail of the particular places from which the gold and &s;ilver were brought, and of the particular quantity of each metal, which, according to the regi&s;ter, each of them afforded. He makes an allowance too for the quantity of each metal which he &s;uppo&s;es may have been &s;muggled. The great experience of this judicious merchant renders his opinion of con&s;iderable weight.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the eloquent and &s;ometimes well informed author of the philo&s;ophical and political hi&s;tory of the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Europeans in the two Indies, the annual importation of regi&s;tered gold and &s;ilver into Spain, at an average of eleven years; viz. from 1754 to 1764, both inclu&s;ive; amounted to 13,984,185; &frac34; pia&s;tres of ten reals. On account of what may have been &s;muggled, however, the whole annual importation, he &s;up|po&s;es, may have amounted to &s;eventeen millions of pia&s;tres; which at 4s. 6d. the pia&s;tre, is equal to 3,825,000l. &s;terling. He gives the detail too of the particular places from which the gold and &s;ilver were brought, and of the particular quantities of each metal which, according to the regi&s;ter, each of them afforded. He in|forms us too, that if we were to judge of the quantity of gold annually imported from the Brazils into Li&s;bon by the amount of the tax paid to the king of Portugal, which it &s;eems is one-fifth
<PB N="262" REF="275">
of the &s;tandard metal, we might value it at eighteen millions of cruzadoes, or forty-five millions of French livres, equal to about two millions &s;terling. On account of what may have been &s;muggled, however, we may &s;afely, he &s;ays, add to this &s;um an eighth more, or 250,000l. &s;terling, &s;o that the whole will amount to 2,250,000l. &s;terling. According to this account, therefore, the whole annual importation of the precious metals into both Spain and Portugal, amounts to about 6,075,000l. &s;terling.</P>
<P>SEVERAL other very well authenticated accounts, I have been a&s;&s;ured, agree in making this whole annual importation amount at an average to about &s;ix millions &s;terling; &s;ometimes a little more, &s;ometimes a little le&s;s.</P>
<P>THE annual importation of the precious metals into Cadiz and Li&s;bon, indeed, is not equal to the whole annual produce of the mines of America. Some part is &s;ent annually by the Acapulco &s;hips to Manilla; &s;ome part is employed in the contraband trade which the Spani&s;h colonies carry on with tho&s;e of other European nations; and &s;ome part, no doubt, remains in the country. The mines of America, be&s;ides, are by no means the only gold and &s;ilver mines in the world. They are, however, by far the mo&s;t abundant. The produce of all the other mines which are known, is in&s;ignificant, it is acknowledged, in compari&s;on with theirs; and the far greater part of their produce, it is likewi&s;e acknow|ledged, is annually imported into Cadiz and Li&s;bon. But the con&s;umption of Birmingham alone, at the rate of fifty thou&s;and pounds a year, is equal to the hundred and twentieth part of this annual importation at the rate of &s;ix millions a year. The whole annual con&s;umption of gold and &s;ilver therefore in all the different countries of the would where tho&s;e metals are u&s;ed, may perhaps be nearly equal to the whole annual produce. The remainder may
<PB N="263" REF="276">
be no more than &s;ufficient to &s;upply the increa&s;ing demand of all thriving countries. It may even have fallen &s;o far &s;hort of this demand as &s;omewhat to rai&s;e the price of tho&s;e metals in the European market.</P>
<P>THE quantity of bra&s;s and iron annually brought from the mine to the market is out of all proportion greater than that of gold and &s;ilver. We do not, however, upon this account, imagine that tho&s;e coar&s;e metals are likely to multiply beyond the demand, or to become gradually cheaper and cheaper. Why &s;hould we imagine that the precious metals are likely to do &s;o? The coar&s;e metals indeed, though harder, are put to much harder u&s;es, and as they are of le&s;s value, le&s;s care is employed in their pre&s;ervation. The precious metals, however, are not nece&s;&s;arily immortal any more than they, but are liable too to be lo&s;t, wa&s;ted and con&s;umed in a great variety of ways.</P>
<P>THE price of all metals, though liable to &s;low and gradual variations, varies le&s;s from year to year than that of almo&s;t any other part of the rude produce of land; and the price of the precious metals is even le&s;s liable to &s;udden variations than that of the coar&s;e ones. The durablene&s;s of metals is the foundation of this extraordinary &s;teadine&s;s of price. The corn which was brought to market la&s;t year, will be all or almo&s;t all con&s;umed long before the end of this year. But &s;ome part of the iron which was brought from the mine two or three hundred years ago, may be &s;till in u&s;e, and perhaps &s;ome part of the gold which was brought from it two or three thou&s;and years ago. The different ma&s;&s;es of corn which in different years mu&s;t &s;upply the con&s;umption of the world, will always be nearly in proportion to the re&s;pective produce of tho&s;e different years. But the proportion between the different ma&s;&s;es of iron which may be in u&s;e in two different years, will be
<PB N="264" REF="277">
very little affected by any accidental difference in the produce of the iron mines of tho&s;e two years; and the proportion between the ma&s;&s;es of gold will be &s;till le&s;s affected by any &s;uch difference in the produce of the gold mines. Though the produce of the greater part of metallick mines, therefore, varies, perhaps, &s;till more from year to year than that of the greater part of corn fields, tho&s;e vari|ations have not the &s;ame effect upon the price of the one &s;pecies of commodities, as upon that of the other.</P>

<HEAD>Variations in the Proportion between the re&s;pective Values of Gold and Silver.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE the di&s;covery of the mines of America, the value of fine gold to fine &s;ilver was regulated in the different mints of Europe, between the proportions of one to ten and one to twelve; that is, an ounce of fine gold was &s;uppo&s;ed to be worth from ten to twelve ounces of fine &s;ilver. About the middle of the la&s;t century it came to be regulated, between the proportions of one to fourteen and one to fifteen; that is, an ounce of fine gold came to be &s;up|po&s;ed worth between fourteen and fifteen ounces of fine &s;ilver. Gold ro&s;e in its nominal value, or in the quantity of &s;ilver which was given for it. Both metals &s;unk in their real value, or in the quantity of labour which they could purcha&s;e; but &s;ilver &s;unk more than gold. Though both the gold and &s;ilver mines of America exceeded in fertility all tho&s;e which had ever been known before, the fertility of the &s;ilver mines had, it &s;eems, been proportionably &s;till greater than that of the gold ones.</P>
<P>THE great quantities of &s;ilver carried annually from Europe to India, have, in &s;ome of the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements, gradually reduced the value of that metal in proportion to gold. In the mint of
<PB N="265" REF="278">
Calcutta, an ounce of fine gold is &s;uppo&s;ed to be worth fifteen ounces of fine &s;ilver, in the &s;ame manner as in Europe. It is in the mint perhaps rated too high for the value which it bears in the market of Bengal. In China, the proportion of gold to &s;ilver &s;till continues as one to ten. In Japan it is &s;aid to be as one to eight.</P>
<P>THE proportion between the quantities of gold and &s;ilver annually imported into Europe, according to Mr. Meggens's account, is as one to twenty-two nearly; that is, for one ounce of gold there are imported a little more than twenty-two ounces of &s;ilver. The great quantity of &s;ilver &s;ent annually to the Ea&s;t Indies, reduces, he &s;uppo&s;es, the quantities of tho&s;e metals which remain in Europe to the proportion of one to fourteen or fifteen, the proportion of their values. The proportion between their values, he &s;eems to think, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the &s;ame as that between their quantities, and would therefore be as one to twenty-two, were it not for this greater exportation of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>BUT the ordinary proportion between the re&s;pective values of two commodities is not nece&s;&s;arily the &s;ame as that between the quan|tities of them which are commonly in the market. The price of an ox, reckoned at ten guineas, is about three&s;core times the price of a lamb, reckoned at 3 s. 6 d. It would be ab&s;urd, however, to infer from thence, that there are commonly in the market three&s;core lambs for one ox: and it would be ju&s;t as ab&s;urd to infer, becau&s;e an ounce of gold will commonly purcha&s;e from fourteen to fifteen ounces of &s;ilver, that there are commonly in the market only fourteen or fifteen ounces of &s;ilver for one ounce of gold.</P>
<P>THE quantity of &s;ilver commonly in the market, it is probable, is much greater in proportion to that of gold, than the value of a
<PB N="266" REF="279">
certain quantity of gold is to that of an equal quantity of &s;ilver. The whole quantity of a cheap commodity brought to market, is commonly, not only greater, but of greater value, than the whole quantity of a dear one. The whole quantity of bread annually brought to market, is not only greater, but of greater value than the whole quantity of butcher's-meat; the whole quantity of butcher's-meat, than the whole quantity of poultry; and the whole quantity of poultry, than the whole quantity of wild fowl. There are &s;o many more purcha&s;ers for the cheap than for the dear commodity, that, not only a greater quantity of it, but a greater value can commonly be di&s;po&s;ed of. The whole quantity, therefore, of the cheap commodity mu&s;t commonly be greater in proportion to the whole quantity of the dear one, than the value of a certain quantity of the dear one, is to the value of an equal quantity of the cheap one. When we compare the precious metals with one another, &s;ilver is a cheap, and gold a dear commodity. We ought naturally to expect, therefore, that there &s;hould always be in the market, not only a greater quantity, but a greater value of &s;ilver than of gold. Let any man, who has a little of both, com|pare his own &s;ilver with his gold plate, and he will probably find, that, not only the quantity, but the value of the former greatly exceeds that of the latter. Many people, be&s;ides, have a good deal of &s;ilver who have no gold plate, which, even with tho&s;e who have it, is generally confined to watch ca&s;es, &s;nuff-boxes, and &s;uch like trinkets, of which the whole amount is &s;eldom of great value. In the Briti&s;h coin, indeed, the value of the gold preponderates greatly, but it is not &s;o in that of all countries. In the coin of &s;ome coun|tries the value of the two metals is nearly equal. In the Scotch coin, before the union with England, the gold preponderated very little, though it did &s;omewhat, as it appears by the accounts of the mint. In the coin of many countries the &s;ilver preponderates. In France, the large&s;t &s;ums are commonly paid in that metal,
<PB N="267" REF="280">
and it is there difficult to get more gold than what it is nece&s;&s;ary to carry about in your pocket. The &s;uperior value, however, of the &s;ilver plate above that of the gold, which takes place in all countries, will much more than compen&s;ate the preponderancy of the gold coin above the &s;ilver, which takes place only in &s;ome countries.</P>
<P>THOUGH, in one &s;en&s;e of the word, &s;ilver always has been, and probably always will be, much cheaper than gold; yet in another &s;en&s;e, gold may, perhaps, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the European market, be &s;aid to be &s;omewhat cheaper than &s;ilver. A commodity may be &s;aid to be dear or cheap, not only according to the ab&s;olute greatne&s;s or &s;mallne&s;s of its u&s;ual price, but according as that price is more or le&s;s above the lowe&s;t for which it is po&s;&s;ible to bring it to market for any con&s;iderable time together. This lowe&s;t price is that which barely replaces, with a moderate profit, the &s;tock which mu&s;t be employed in bringing the commodity thither. It is the price which affords nothing to the landlord, of which rent makes not any component part, but which re&s;olves it&s;elf altogether into wages and profit. But, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the European market, gold is certainly &s;omewhat nearer to this lowe&s;t price than &s;ilver. The tax of the king of Spain upon gold is only one-twentieth part of the &s;tandard metal, or five per cent.; whereas his tax upon &s;ilver amounts to one-fifth part of it, or to twenty per cent. In the&s;e taxes too, it has already been ob&s;erved, con&s;i&s;ts the whole rent of the greater part of the gold and &s;ilver mines of Spani&s;h America; and that upon gold is &s;till wor&s;e paid than that upon &s;ilver. The profits of the undertakers of gold mines too, as they more rarely make a fortune, mu&s;t, in general, be &s;till more moderate than tho&s;e of the undertakers of &s;ilver mines. The price of Spani&s;h gold, therefore, as it affords both le&s;s rent and le&s;s profit, mu&s;t, in the European market, be &s;omewhat nearer to the lowe&s;t
<PB N="268" REF="281">
price for which it is po&s;&s;ible to bring it thither, than the price of Spani&s;h &s;ilver. The tax of the king of Portugal, indeed, upon the gold of the Brazils, is the &s;ame with that of the king of Spain upon the &s;ilver of Mexico and Peru; or one-fifth part of the &s;tandard metal. It mu&s;t &s;till be true, however, that the whole ma&s;s of American gold comes to the European market, at a price nearer to the lowe&s;t for which it is po&s;&s;ible to bring it thither, than the whole ma&s;s of American &s;ilver. When all expences are computed, it would &s;eem, the whole quantity of the one metal cannot be di&s;po&s;ed of &s;o advantageou&s;ly as the whole quantity of the other.</P>
<P>THE price of diamonds and other precious &s;tones may, perhaps, be &s;till nearer to the lowe&s;t price at which it is po&s;&s;ible to bring them to market, than even the price of gold.</P>
<P>WERE the king of Spain to give up his tax upon &s;ilver, the price of that metal might not, upon that account, &s;ink immediately in the European market. As long as the quantity brought thither continued the &s;ame as before, it would &s;till continue to &s;ell at the &s;ame price. The fir&s;t and immediate effect of this change, would be to increa&s;e the profits of mining, the undertaker of the mine now gaining all that he had been u&s;ed to pay to the king. The&s;e great profits would &s;oon tempt a greater number of people to undertake the working of new mines. Many mines would be wrought which cannot be wrought at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e they cannot afford to pay this tax, and the quantity of &s;ilver brought to market would, in a few years, be &s;o much augmented, probably, as to &s;ink its price about one-fifth below its pre&s;ent &s;tandard. This diminution in the value of &s;ilver would again reduce the profits of mining nearly to their pre&s;ent rate.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="282">
IT is not indeed very probable, that any part of a tax which affords &s;o important a revenue, and which is impo&s;ed too upon one of the mo&s;t proper &s;ubjects of taxation, will ever be given up as long as it is po&s;&s;ible to pay it. The impo&s;&s;ibility of paying it, however, may in time make it nece&s;&s;ary to dimini&s;h it, in the &s;ame manner as it made it nece&s;&s;ary to dimini&s;h the tax upon gold. That the &s;ilver mines of Spani&s;h America, like all other mines, become gradually more expen&s;ive in the working, on account of the greater depths at which it is nece&s;&s;ary to carry on the works, and of the greater expence of drawing out the water and of &s;upplying them with fre&s;h air at tho&s;e depths, is acknowledged by every body who has enquired into the &s;tate of tho&s;e mines.</P>
<P>THESE cau&s;es, which are equivalent to a growing &s;carcity of &s;ilver, (for a commodity may be &s;aid to grow &s;carcer when it becomes more difficult and expen&s;ive to collect a certain quantity of it), mu&s;t, in time, produce one or other of the three following events. The increa&s;e of the expence mu&s;t either, fir&s;t, be com|pen&s;ated altogether by a proportionable increa&s;e in the price of the metal; or, &s;econdly, it mu&s;t be compen&s;ated altogether by a proportionable diminution of the tax upon &s;ilver; or, thirdly, it mu&s;t be compen&s;ated partly by the one, and partly by the other of tho&s;e two expedients. This third event is very po&s;&s;ible. As gold ro&s;e in its price in proportion to &s;ilver, notwith&s;tanding a great diminution of the tax upon gold; &s;o &s;ilver might ri&s;e in its price in proportion to labour and commodities, notwith&s;tanding an equal diminution of the tax upon &s;ilver.</P>
<P>THAT the fir&s;t of the&s;e three events has already begun to take place, or that &s;ilver has, during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century, begun to ri&s;e &s;omewhat in its value in the European market, the facts and arguments which have been alledged above di&s;po&s;e me to
<PB N="270" REF="283">
believe. The ri&s;e, indeed, has hitherto been &s;o very &s;mall, that, after all that has been &s;aid, it may, perhaps, appear to many people uncertain, not only whether this event has actually taken place, but whether the contrary may not have taken place, or whether the value of &s;ilver may not &s;till continue to fall in the European market.</P>

<P>THE increa&s;e of the wealth of Europe, and the popular notion that, as the quantity of the precious metals naturally increa&s;es with the increa&s;e of wealth, &s;o their value dimini&s;hes as their quan|tity increa&s;es, may, be&s;ides, di&s;po&s;e many people to believe that their value &s;till continues to fall in the European market; and the &s;till gradually increa&s;ing price of many parts of the rude produce of land may, perhaps, confirm them &s;till further in this opinion.</P>
<P>THAT the increa&s;e of the quantity of the precious metals in any country, which ari&s;es from the increa&s;e of wealth, has no tendency to dimini&s;h their value, I have endeavoured to &s;how already. Gold and &s;ilver naturally re&s;ort to a rich country, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that all &s;orts of luxuries and curio&s;ities re&s;ort to it; not becau&s;e they are cheaper there than in poorer countries, but becau&s;e they are dearer, or becau&s;e a better price is given for them.

the earth, &amp;c. naturally grow dearer as the &s;ociety advances in wealth and improvement, I have endeavoured to &s;how already. Though &s;uch commodities, therefore, come to exchange for a greater quantity of &s;ilver than before, it will not from thence follow that &s;ilver has become really cheaper, or will purcha&s;e le&s;s labour than before, but that &s;uch commodities have become really dearer, or will purcha&s;e more labour than before. It is not their nominal price only, but their real price which ri&s;es in the progre&s;s of improvement. The ri&s;e of their nominal price is the effect, not of any degradation of the value of &s;ilver, but of the ri&s;e in their real price.</P>

<HEAD>Different Effects of the Progre&s;s of Improvement upon three different Sorts of rude Produce.</HEAD>
<P>THESE different &s;orts of rude produce may be divided into three cla&s;&s;es. The fir&s;t comprehends tho&s;e which it is &s;carce in the power of human indu&s;try to multiply at all.

<HEAD>Fir&s;t Sort.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;ort of rude produce of which the price ri&s;es in the progre&s;s of improvement, is that which it is &s;carce in the power of human indu&s;try to multiply at all. It con&s;i&s;ts in tho&s;e things which nature produces only in certain quantities, and which being of a very peri&s;hable nature, it is impo&s;&s;ible to accumulate together the produce of many different &s;ea&s;ons. Such are the greater part of rare and &s;ingular birds and fi&s;hes, many different &s;orts of game, almo&s;t all wild-fowl, all birds of pa&s;&s;age in particular, as well as many other things. When wealth, and the luxury which accom|panies it, increa&s;e, the demand for the&s;e is likely to increa&s;e with them, and no effort of human indu&s;try may be able to increa&s;e the &s;upply much beyond what it was before this increa&s;e of the demand. The quantity of &s;uch commodities, therefore, remaining the &s;ame, or nearly the &s;ame, while the competition to purcha&s;e them is con|tinually increa&s;ing, their price may ri&s;e to any degree of extrava|gance, and &s;eems not to be limited by any certain boundary. If woodcocks &s;hould become &s;o fa&s;hionable as to &s;ell for twenty guineas a-piece, no effort of human indu&s;try could increa&s;e the number of tho&s;e brought to market, much beyond what it is at pre&s;ent. The high price paid by the Romans, in the time of their greate&s;t grandeur, for rare birds and fi&s;hes, may in this manner ea&s;ily be accounted for. The&s;e prices were not the effects of the low value of &s;ilver in tho&s;e times, but of the high value of &s;uch rarities and curio&s;ities as human indu&s;try could not multiply at plea&s;ure. The real value of &s;ilver was higher at Rome, for &s;ome time before and after the fall of the republic, than it is through the greater part of Europe at pre&s;ent. Three &s;e&s;tertii, equal to about &s;ixpence &s;terling, was the price which the republic paid for the modius or peck of the tithe wheat of Sicily. This price, however,
<PB N="273" REF="286">
was probably below the average market price, the obligation to deliver their wheat at this rate being con&s;idered as a tax upon the Sicilian farmers. When the Romans, therefore, had occa&s;ion to order more corn than the tithe of wheat amounted to, they were bound by capitulation to pay for the &s;urplus at the rate of four &s;e&s;tertii, or eight-pence &s;terling the peck; and this had probably been reckoned the moderate and rea&s;onable, that is, the ordinary or average contract price of tho&s;e times; it is equal to about one and twenty &s;hillings the quarter. Eight and twenty &s;hillings the quarter was, before the late years of &s;carcity, the ordinary contract price of Engli&s;h wheat, which in quality is inferior to the Sicilian, and generally &s;ells for a lower price in the European market. The value of &s;ilver, therefore, in tho&s;e antient times, mu&s;t have been to its value in the pre&s;ent, as three to four inver&s;ely, that is, three ounces of &s;ilver would then have purcha&s;ed the &s;ame quantity of labour and commodities which four ounces will do at pre&s;ent. When we read in Pliny, therefore, that Seius bought a white nightingale, as a pre&s;ent for the empre&s;s Agrippina, at the price of &s;ix thou&s;and &s;e&s;tertii, equal to about fifty pounds of our pre&s;ent money; and that A&s;inius Celer purcha&s;ed a &s;urmullet at the price of eight thou&s;and &s;e&s;tertii, equal to about &s;ixty-&s;ix pounds thirteen &s;hillings and four-pence of our pre&s;ent money, the extravagance of tho&s;e prices, how much &s;oever it may &s;urpri&s;e us, is apt, not|with&s;tanding, to appear to us about one-third le&s;s than it really was. Their real price, the quantity of labour and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which was given away for them, was about one-third more than their nominal price is apt to expre&s;s to us in the pre&s;ent times. Seius gave for the nightingale the command of a quantity of labour and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, equal to what 661. 13s. 4d. would purcha&s;e in the pre&s;ent times; and A&s;inius Celer gave for the &s;urmullet the com|mand of a quantity equal to what 881. 17s. 9&frac13;d. would purcha&s;e. What occa&s;ioned the extravagance of tho&s;e high prices was, not &s;o
<PB N="274" REF="287">
much the abundance of &s;ilver, as the abundance of labour and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, of which tho&s;e Romans had the di&s;po&s;al, beyond what was nece&s;&s;ary for their own u&s;e. The quantity of &s;ilver, of which they had the di&s;po&s;al, was a good deal le&s;s than what the command of the &s;ame quantity of labour and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence would have procured to them in the pre&s;ent times.</P>

<HEAD>Second Sort.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;econd &s;ort of rude produce of which the price ri&s;es in the progre&s;s of improvement, is that which human indu&s;try can mul|tiply in proportion to the demand. It con&s;i&s;ts in tho&s;e u&s;eful plants and animals, which, in uncultivated countries, nature pro|duces with &s;uch profu&s;e abundance, that they are of little or no value, and which, as cultivation advances, are therefore forced to give place to &s;ome more profitable produce. During a long period in the progre&s;s of improvement, the quantity of the&s;e is continually dimini&s;hing, while at the &s;ame time the demand for them is continu|ally increa&s;ing. Their real value, therefore, the real quantity of la|bour which they will purcha&s;e or command, gradually ri&s;es, till at la&s;t it gets &s;o high as to render them as profitable a produce as any thing el&s;e which human indu&s;try can rai&s;e upon the mo&s;t fertile and be&s;t cultivated land. When it has got &s;o high it cannot well go higher. If it did, more land and more indu&s;try would &s;oon be employed to increa&s;e their quantity.</P>
<P>WHEN the price of cattle, for example, ri&s;es &s;o high that it is as profitable to cultivate land in order to rai&s;e food for them, as in order to rai&s;e food for man, it cannot well go higher. If it did, more corn land would &s;oon be turned into pa&s;ture. The exten&s;ion of tillage, by dimini&s;hing the quantity of wild pa&s;ture, dimini&s;hes the quantity of butcher's-meat which the country naturally produces without labour or cultivation, and by increa&s;ing the number of
<PB N="275" REF="288">
tho&s;e who have either corn, or, what comes to the &s;ame thing, the price of corn, to give in exchange for it, increa&s;es the demand. The price of butcher's-meat, therefore, and con&s;e|quently of cattle, mu&s;t gradually ri&s;e till it gets &s;o high that it becomes as profitable to employ the mo&s;t fertile and be&s;t cultivated lands in rai&s;ing food for them as in rai&s;ing corn. But it mu&s;t always be late in the progre&s;s of improvement before tillage can be &s;o far extended as to rai&s;e the price of cattle to this height; and till it has got to this height, if the country is advancing at all, their price mu&s;t be continually ri&s;ing. There are, perhaps, &s;ome parts of Europe in which the price of cattle has not yet got to this height. It had not got to this height in any part of Scotland before the union. Had the Scotch cattle been always confined to the market of Scotland, in a country in which the quantity of land, which can be applied to no other purpo&s;e but the feeding of cattle, is &s;o great in proportion to what can be applied to other purpo&s;es, it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible, perhaps, that their price could ever have ri&s;en &s;o high as to render it profitable to cultivate land for the &s;ake of feed|ing them. In England, the price of cattle, it has already been ob&s;erved, &s;eems, in the neighbourhood of London, to have got to this height about the beginning of the la&s;t century; but it was much later probably before it got to it through the greater part of the remoter counties; in &s;ome of which, perhaps, it may &s;carce yet have got to it. Of all the different &s;ub&s;tances, however, which compo&s;e this &s;econd &s;ort of rude produce, cattle is, perhaps, that of which the price, in the progre&s;s of improvement, ri&s;es fir&s;t to this height.</P>
<P>TILL the price of cattle, indeed, has got to this height, it &s;eems &s;carce po&s;&s;ible that the greater part, even of tho&s;e lands which are capable of the highe&s;t cultivation, can be completely cultivated. In all farms too di&s;tant from any town to carry manure from it,
<PB N="276" REF="289">
that is, in the far greater part of tho&s;e of every exten&s;ive country, the quantity of well-cultivated land mu&s;t be in proportion to the quantity of manure which the farm it&s;elf produces; and this again mu&s;t be in proportion to the &s;tock of cattle which are maintained upon it. The land is manured either by pa&s;turing the cattle upon it, or by feeding them in the &s;table, and from thence carrying out their dung to it. But unle&s;s the price of the cattle be &s;ufficient to pay both the rent and profit of cultivated land, the farmer cannot afford to pa&s;ture them upon it; and he can &s;till le&s;s afford to feed them in the &s;table. It is with the produce of improved and cultivated land only, that cattle can be fed in the &s;table; be|cau&s;e to collect the &s;canty and &s;cattered produce of wa&s;te and un|improved lands would require too much labour and be too ex|pen&s;ive. If the price of the cattle, therefore, is not &s;ufficient to pay for the produce of improved and cultivated land, when they are allowed to pa&s;ture it, that price will be &s;till le&s;s &s;ufficient to pay for that produce when it mu&s;t be collected with a good deal of additional labour, and brought into the &s;table to them. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, therefore, no more cattle can, with profit, be fed in the &s;table than what are nece&s;&s;ary for tillage. But the&s;e can never afford manure enough for keeping con&s;tantly in good condition, all the lands which they are capable of cultivating. What they afford being in&s;ufficient for the whole farm, will naturally be re|&s;erved for the lands to which it can be mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly or conveniently applied; the mo&s;t fertile, or tho&s;e, perhaps, in the neighbourhood of the farm-yard. The&s;e, therefore, will be kept con&s;tantly in good condition and fit for tillage. The re&s;t will, the greater part of them, be allowed to lie wa&s;te, producing &s;carce any thing but &s;ome mi&s;erable pa&s;ture, ju&s;t &s;ufficient to keep alive a few &s;traggling, half-&s;tarved cattle; the farm, though much under&s;tocked in proportion to what would be nece&s;&s;ary for its com|plete cultivation, being very frequently over&s;tocked in proportion to
<PB N="277" REF="290">
its actual produce. A portion of this wa&s;te land, however, after having been pa&s;tured in this wretched manner for &s;ix or &s;even years together, may be ploughed up, when it will yield, perhaps, a poor crop or two of bad oats, or of &s;ome other coar&s;e grain; and then, being entirely exhau&s;ted, it mu&s;t be re&s;ted and pa&s;tured again as before, and another portion ploughed up to be in the &s;ame manner exhau&s;ted and re&s;ted again in its turn. Such accordingly was the general &s;y&s;tem of management all over the low country of Scotland before the union. The lands which were kept con|&s;tantly well manured and in good condition, &s;eldom exceeded a third or a fourth part of the whole farm, and &s;ometimes did not amount to a fifth or a &s;ixth part of it. The re&s;t were never ma|nured, but a certain portion of them was in its turn, notwith|&s;tanding, regularly cultivated and exhau&s;ted. Under this &s;y&s;tem of management, it is evident, even that part of the lands of Scot|land which is capable of good cultivation, could produce but little in compari&s;on of what it may be capable of producing. But how di&s;advantageous &s;oever this &s;y&s;tem may appear, yet before the union the low price of cattle &s;eems to have rendered it almo&s;t unavoid|able. If, notwith&s;tanding a great ri&s;e in their price, it &s;till con|tinues to prevail through a con&s;iderable part of the country, it is owing in many places, no doubt, to ignorance and attachment to old cu&s;toms, but in mo&s;t places to the unavoidable ob&s;tructions which the natural cour&s;e of things oppo&s;es to the immediate or &s;peedy e&s;tabli&s;hment of a better &s;y&s;tem: fir&s;t, to the poverty of the tenants, to their not having yet had time to acquire a &s;tock of cattle &s;ufficient to cultivate their lands more completely, the &s;ame ri&s;e of price which would render it advantageous for them to main|tain a greater &s;tock, rendering it more difficult for them to ac|quire it; and, &s;econdly, to their not having yet had time to put their lands in condition to maintain this greater &s;tock properly, &s;uppo&s;ing they were capable of acquiring it. The increa&s;e of
<PB N="278" REF="291">
&s;tock and the improvement of land are two events which mu&s;t go hand in hand, and of which the one can no where much out-run the other. Without &s;ome increa&s;e of &s;tock, there can be &s;carce any improvement of land, but there can be no con&s;iderable increa&s;e of &s;tock but in con&s;equence of a con&s;iderable improvement of land; becau&s;e otherwi&s;e the land could not maintain it. The&s;e natural ob&s;tructions to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a better &s;y&s;tem, can|not be removed but by a long cour&s;e of frugality and indu&s;try; and half a century or a century more, perhaps, mu&s;t pa&s;s away before the old &s;y&s;tem, which is wearing out gradually, can be completely aboli&s;hed through all the different parts of the country. Of all commercial advantages, however, which Scotland has derived from the union with England, this ri&s;e in the price of cattle is, per|haps, the greate&s;t. It has not only rai&s;ed the value of all highland e&s;tates, but it has, perhaps, been the principal cau&s;e of the im|provement of the low country.</P>
<P>IN all new colonies the great quantity of wa&s;te land, which can for many years be applied to no other purpo&s;e but the feed|ing of cattle, &s;oon renders them extremely abundant, and in every thing great cheapne&s;s is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of great abundance. Though all the cattle of the European colonies in America were originally carried from Europe, they &s;oon multi|plied &s;o much there, and became of &s;o little value, that even hor&s;es were allowed to run wild in the woods without any owner thinking it worth while to claim them. It mu&s;t be a long time after the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch colonies before it can become profitable to feed cattle upon the produce of cultivated land. The &s;ame cau&s;es, therefore, the want of manure, and the di&s;|proportion between the &s;tock employed in cultivation, and the land which it is de&s;tined to cultivate, are likely to introduce there a &s;y&s;tem of hu&s;bandry not unlike that which &s;till continues to
<PB N="279" REF="292">
take place in &s;o many parts of Scotland. Mr. Kalm, the Swedi&s;h travellor, when he gives an account of the hu&s;bandry of &s;ome of the Engli&s;h colonies in North America, as he found it in 1749, ob&s;erves, accordingly, that he can with difficulty di&s;cover there the character of the Engli&s;h nation, &s;o well &s;killed in all the different branches of agriculture. They make &s;carce any manure for their corn fields, he &s;ays; but when one piece of ground has been exhau&s;ted by continual cropping, they clear and cultivate another piece of fre&s;h land; and when that is exhau&s;ted, proceed to a third. Their cattle are allowed to wander through the woods and other uncultivated grounds, where they are half &s;tarved; having long ago extirpated almo&s;t all the annual gra&s;&s;es by cropping them too early in the &s;pring, before they had time to form their flowers, or to &s;hed their &s;eeds. The annual gra&s;&s;es were, it &s;eems, the be&s;t natural gra&s;&s;es in that part of North America; and when the Europeans fir&s;t &s;ettled there, they u&s;ed to grow very thick, and to ri&s;e three or four feet high. A piece of ground which, when he wrote, could not maintain one cow, would in former times, he was a&s;&s;ured, have maintained four, each of which would have given four times the quantity of milk, which that one was capable of giving. The poorne&s;s of the pa&s;ture had, in his opinion, occa&s;ioned the degradation of their cattle, which degenerated &s;en&s;ibly from one generation to another. They were probably not unlike that &s;tunted breed which was common all over Scotland thirty or forty years ago, and which is now &s;o much mended-through the greater part of the low country, not &s;o much by a change of the breed, though that expedient has been employed in &s;ome places, as by a more plentiful method of feeding them.</P>
<P>THOUGH it is late, therefore, in the progre&s;s of improvement before cattle can bring &s;uch a price as to render it profitable to
<PB N="280" REF="293">
cultivate land for the &s;ake of feeding them; yet of all the dif|ferent parts which compo&s;e this &s;econd &s;ort of rude produce, they are perhaps the fir&s;t which bring this price; becau&s;e till they bring it, it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible that improvement can be brought near even to that degree of perfection to which it has arrived in many parts of Europe.</P>
<P>AS cattle are among the fir&s;t, &s;o perhaps veni&s;on is among the la&s;t parts of this &s;ort of rude produce which bring this price. The price of veni&s;on in Great Britain, how extravagant &s;oever it may appear, is not near &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate the expence of a deer park, as is well known to all tho&s;e who have had any experience in the feeding of deer. If it was otherwi&s;e, the feed|ing of deer would &s;oon become an article of common farming; in the &s;ame manner as the feeding of tho&s;e &s;mall birds called Turdi was among the antient Romans. Varro and Columella a&s;&s;ure us that it was a mo&s;t profitable article. The fattening of Ortolans, birds of pa&s;&s;age which arrive lean in the country, is &s;aid to be &s;o in &s;ome parts of France. If veni&s;on continues in fa&s;hion, and the wealth and luxury of Great Britain increa&s;e as they have done for &s;ome time pa&s;t, its price may very probably ri&s;e &s;till higher than it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>BETWEEN that period in the progre&s;s of improvement which brings to its height the price of &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an article as cattle, and that which brings to it the price of &s;uch a &s;uperfluity as veni&s;on, there is a very long interval, in the cour&s;e of which many other &s;orts of rude produce gradually arrive at their highe&s;t price, &s;ome &s;ooner and &s;ome later, according to different circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>THUS in every farm the offals of the barn and &s;tables will maintain a certain number of poultry. The&s;e, as they are fed
<PB N="281" REF="294">
with what would otherwi&s;e be lo&s;t, are a meer &s;ave-all; and as they co&s;t the farmer &s;carce any thing, &s;o he can afford to &s;ell them for very little. Almo&s;t all that he gets is pure gain, and their price can &s;carce be &s;o low as to di&s;courage him from feed|ing this number. But in countries ill cultivated, and, therefore, but thinly inhabited, the poultry, which are thus rai&s;ed without expence, are often fully &s;ufficient to &s;upply the whole demand. In this &s;tate of things, therefore, they are often as cheap as butcher's-meat, or any other &s;ort of animal food. But the whole quantity of poultry, which the farm in this manner produces without expence, mu&s;t always be much &s;maller than the whole quantity of butcher's meat which is reared upon it; and in times of wealth and luxury what is rare, with only nearly equal merit, is always preferred to what is common. As wealth and luxury increa&s;e, therefore, in con&s;equence of improvement and culti|vation, the price of poultry gradually ri&s;es above that of butcher's meat, till at la&s;t it gets &s;o high that it becomes profitable to cul|tivate land for the &s;ake of feeding them. When it has got to this height, it cannot well go higher. If it did, more land would &s;oon be turned to this purpo&s;e. In &s;everal provinces of France, the feeding of poultry is con&s;idered as a very important article in rural oeconomy, and &s;ufficiently profitable to encourage the farmer to rai&s;e a con&s;iderable quantity of Indian corn and buck wheat for this purpo&s;e. A middling farmer will there &s;ometimes have four hundred fowls in his yard. The feeding of poultry &s;eems &s;carce yet to be generally con&s;idered as a matter of &s;o much importance in England. They are certainly, however, dearer in England than in France, as England receives con&s;iderable &s;up|plies from France. In the progre&s;s of improvement, the period at which every particular &s;ort of animal food is deare&s;t, mu&s;t na|turally be that which immediately preceeds the general practice of cultivating land for the &s;ake of rai&s;ing it. For &s;ome time
<PB N="282" REF="295">
before this practice becomes general, the &s;carcity mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;e the price. After it has become general, new methods of feeding are commonly fallen upon, which enable the farmer to rai&s;e upon the &s;ame quantity of ground a much greater quantity of that particular &s;ort of animal food. The plenty not only obliges him to &s;ell cheaper, but in con&s;equence of the&s;e improve|ments he can afford to &s;ell cheaper; for if he could not afford it, the plenty would not be of long continuance. It has been probably in this manner that the introduction of clover, turnips, carrots, cabbages, &amp;c. has contributed to &s;ink the common price of butcher's-meat in the London market &s;omewhat below what it was about the beginning of the la&s;t century.</P>
<P>THE hog, that finds his food among ordure, and greedily devours many things rejected by every other u&s;eful animal, is, like poultry, originally kept as a &s;ave-all. As long as the number of &s;uch ani|mals, which can thus be reared at little or no expence, is fully &s;ufficient to &s;upply the demand, this &s;ort of butcher's-meat comes to market at a much lower price than any other. But when the demand ri&s;es beyond what this quantity can &s;upply, when it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e food on purpo&s;e for feeding and fattening hogs, in the &s;ame manner as for feeding and fatten|ing other cattle, the price nece&s;&s;arily ri&s;es, and becomes propor|tionably either higher or lower than that of other butcher's-meat, according as the nature of the country, and the &s;tate of its agriculture, happen to render the feeding of hogs more or le&s;s expen&s;ive than that of other cattle. In France, according to Mr. Buffon, the price of pork is nearly equal to that of beef. In mo&s;t parts of Great Britain it is at pre&s;ent &s;omewhat higher.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="296">
THE great ri&s;e in the price both of hogs and poultry has in Great Britain been frequently imputed to the diminution of the number of cottagers and other &s;mall occupiers of land; an event which has in every part of Europe been the immediate fore-runner of improvement and better cultivation, but which at the &s;ame time may have contributed to rai&s;e the price of tho&s;e articles, both &s;omewhat &s;ooner and &s;omewhat fa&s;ter than it would otherwi&s;e have ri&s;en. As the poore&s;t family can often maintain a cat or a dog, without any expence, &s;o the poore&s;t occupiers of land can commonly maintain a few poultry, or a &s;ow and a few pigs, at very little. The little offals of their own table, their whey, &s;kimmed milk, and butter-milk, &s;upply tho&s;e animals with a part of their food, and they find the re&s;t in the neighbouring fields without doing any &s;en&s;ible damage to any body. By dimini&s;hing the number of tho&s;e &s;mall occupiers, therefore, the quantity of this &s;ort of provi&s;ions which is thus produced at little or no expence, mu&s;t certainly have been a good deal dimini&s;hed, and their price mu&s;t con&s;equently have been rai&s;ed both &s;ooner and fa&s;ter than it would otherwi&s;e have ri&s;en. Sooner or later, however, in the progre&s;s of improvement, it mu&s;t at any rate have ri&s;en to the utmo&s;t height to which it is capable of ri&s;ing; or to the price which pays the labour and expence of cultivating the land which furni&s;hes them with food as well as the&s;e are paid upon the greater part of other cultivated land.</P>
<P>THE bu&s;ine&s;s of the dairy, like the feeding of hogs and poultry, is originally carried on as a &s;ave-all. The cattle nece&s;&s;arily kept upon the farm, produce more milk than either the rearing of their own young, or the con&s;umption of the farmer's family requires; and they produce mo&s;t at one particular &s;ea&s;on. But of all the productions of land, milk is perhaps the mo&s;t peri&s;hable. In the warm &s;ea&s;on, when it is mo&s;t abundant, it will &s;carce keep
<PB N="284" REF="297">
four and twenty hours. The farmer, by making it into fre&s;h butter, &s;tores a &s;mall part of it for a week: by making it into &s;alt butter, for a year: and by making it into chee&s;e, he &s;tores a much greater part of it for &s;everal years. Part of all the&s;e is re&s;erved for the u&s;e of his own family. The re&s;t goes to market, in order to find the be&s;t price which is to be had, and which can &s;carce be &s;o low as to di&s;courage him from &s;ending thither what|ever is over and above the u&s;e of his own family. If it is very low, indeed, he will be likely to manage his dairy in a very &s;lovenly and dirty manner, and will &s;carce perhaps think it worth while to have a particular room or building on purpo&s;e for it, but will &s;uffer the bu&s;ine&s;s to be carried on amid&s;t the &s;moke, filth, and na&s;tine&s;s of his own kitchen; as was the ca&s;e of almo&s;t all the farmers dairies in Scotland thirty or forty years ago, and as is the ca&s;e of many of them &s;till. The &s;ame cau&s;es which gradually rai&s;e the price of butcher's-meat, the increa&s;e of the demand, and, in con&s;equence of the improvement of the country, the diminution of the quantity which can be fed at little or no expence, rai&s;e, in the &s;ame manner, that of the produce of the dairy, of which the price naturally connects with that of butcher's|meat, or with the expence of feeding cattle. The increa&s;e of price pays for more labour, care, and cleanline&s;s. The dairy be|comes more worthy of the farmer's attention, and the quality of its produce gradually improves. The price at la&s;t gets &s;o high that it becomes worth while to employ &s;ome of the mo&s;t fertile and be&s;t cultivated lands in feeding cattle merely for the purpo&s;e of the dairy; and when it has got to this height, it cannot well go higher. If it did, more land would &s;oon be turned to this purpo&s;e. It &s;eems to have got to this height through the greater part of England, where much good land is commonly employed in this manner. If you except the neighbourhood of a few con&s;iderable towns, it &s;eems not yet to have got to this height any where in Scotland,
<PB N="285" REF="298">
where common farmers &s;eldom employ much good land in rai&s;ing food for cattle merely for the purpo&s;e of the dairy. The price of the produce, though it has ri&s;en very con&s;iderably within the&s;e few years, is probably &s;till too low to admit of it. The inferiority of the quality, indeed, compared with that of the produce of Engli&s;h dairies, is fully equal to that of the price. But this inferiority of quality is, perhaps, rather the effect of this lowne&s;s of price than the cau&s;e of it. Though the quality was much better, the greater part of what is brought to market could not, I apprehend, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of the country, be di&s;po&s;ed of at a much better price; and the pre&s;ent price, it is probable, would not pay the expence of the land and labour nece&s;&s;ary for producing a much better quality. Through the greater part of England, notwith&s;tanding the &s;uperiority of price, the dairy is not reckoned a more profitable employment of land than the rai&s;ing of corn, or the fattening of cattle, the two great objects of agriculture. Through the greater part of Scotland, therefore, it cannot yet be equally profitable.</P>
<P>THE lands of no country, it is evident, can ever be compleatly cultivated and improved, till once the price of every produce, which human indu&s;try is obliged to rai&s;e upon them, has got &s;o high as to pay for the expence of compleat improvement and cultivation. In order to do this, the price of each particular produce mu&s;t be &s;ufficient, fir&s;t, to pay the rent of good corn land, as it is that which regulates the rent of the greater part of other cultivated land; and, &s;econdly, to pay the labour and expence of the farmer as well as they are commonly paid upon good corn land; or, in other words, to replace with the ordinary profits the &s;tock which he employs about it. This ri&s;e in the price of each particular produce, mu&s;t evidently be previous to the improvement and culti|vation of the land which is de&s;tined for rai&s;ing it. Gain is the
<PB N="286" REF="299">
end of all improvement, and nothing could de&s;erve that name of which lo&s;s was to be the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. But lo&s;s mu&s;t be the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of improving land for the &s;ake of a pro|duce of which the price could never bring back the expence. If the compleat improvement and cultivation of the country be, as it mo&s;t certainly is, the greate&s;t of all publick advantages, this ri&s;e in the price of all tho&s;e different &s;orts of rude produce, in&s;tead of being con&s;idered as a publick calamity, ought to be regarded as the nece&s;&s;ary fore-runner and attendant of the greate&s;t of all publick advantages.</P>
<P>THIS ri&s;e too in the nominal or money price of all tho&s;e different &s;orts of rude produce has been the effect, not of any degradation in the value of &s;ilver, but of a ri&s;e in their real price. They have become worth, not only a greater quantity of &s;ilver, but a greater quantity of labour and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence than before. As it co&s;ts a greater quantity of labour and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to bring them to market, &s;o when they are brought thither, they repre&s;ent or are equivalent to a greater quantity.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="3" TYPE="sort">
<HEAD>Third Sort.</HEAD>
<P>THE third and la&s;t &s;ort of rude produce, of which the price naturally ri&s;es in the progre&s;s of improvement, is that in which the efficacy of human indu&s;try, in augmenting the quantity, is either limited or uncertain. Though the real price of this &s;ort of rude produce, therefore, naturally tends to ri&s;e in the progre&s;s of im|provement, yet, according as different accidents happen to render the efforts of human indu&s;try more or le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful in augment|ing the quantity, it may happen &s;ometimes even to fall, &s;ometimes to continue the &s;ame in very different periods of improvement, and &s;ometimes to ri&s;e more or le&s;s in the &s;ame period.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="300">
THERE are &s;ome &s;orts of rude produce which nature has ren|dered a kind of appendages to other &s;orts; &s;o that the quantity of the one which any country can afford, is nece&s;&s;arily limited by that of the other. The quantity of wool or of raw hides, for example, which any country can afford, is nece&s;&s;arily limited by the number of great and &s;mall cattle that are kept in it. The &s;tate of its improvement and the nature of its agriculture, again nece&s;&s;arily determine this number.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame cau&s;es, which in the progre&s;s of improvement, gra|dually rai&s;e the price of butcher's-meat, &s;hould have the &s;ame effect, it may be thought, upon the prices of wool and raw hides, and rai&s;e them too nearly in the &s;ame proportion. It probably would be &s;o, if in the rude beginnings of improvement the market for the latter commodities was confined within as narrow bounds as that for the former. But the extent of their re&s;pective markets is commonly extreamly different.</P>
<P>THE market for butcher's-meat is almo&s;t every where confined to the country which produces it. Ireland, and &s;ome part of Briti&s;h America indeed, carry on a con&s;iderable trade in &s;alt pro|vi&s;ions; but they are, I believe, the only countries in the com|mercial world which do &s;o, or which export to other countries any con&s;iderable part of their butcher's-meat.</P>
<P>THE market for wool and raw hides, on the contrary, is in the rude beginnings of improvement very &s;eldom confined to the country which produces them. They can ea&s;ily be tran&s;ported to di&s;tant countries, wool without any preparation, and raw hides with very little; and as they are the materials of many manufac|tures, the indu&s;try of other countries may occa&s;ion a demand for
<PB N="288" REF="301">
them, though that of the country which produces them might not occa&s;ion any.</P>
<P>IN countries ill cultivated, and therefore but thinly inhabited, the price of the wool and the hide bears always a much greater proportion to that of the whole bea&s;t, than in countries where, improvement and population being further advanced, there is more demand for butcher's-meat. Mr. Hume ob&s;erves, that in the Saxon times, the fleece was e&s;timated at two-fifths of the value of the whole &s;heep, and that this was much above the proportion of its pre&s;ent e&s;timation. In &s;ome provinces of Spain, I have been a&s;&s;ured, the &s;heep is frequently killed merely for the &s;ake of the fleece and the tallow. The carca&s;e is often left to rot upon the ground, or to be devoured by bea&s;ts and birds of prey. If this &s;ometimes happens even in Spain, it happens almo&s;t con&s;tantly in Chili, at Buenos Ayres, and in many other parts of Spani&s;h America, where the horned cattle are almo&s;t con&s;tantly killed merely for the &s;ake of the hide and the tallow. This too u&s;ed to happen almo&s;t con&s;tantly in Hi&s;paniola, while it was infe&s;ted by the Buccaneers, and before the &s;ettlement, improvement and popu|lou&s;ne&s;s of the French plantations (which now extend round the coa&s;t of almo&s;t the whole we&s;tern half of the i&s;land) had given &s;ome value to the cattle of the Spaniards, who &s;till continue to po&s;&s;e&s;s, not only the ea&s;tern part of the coa&s;t, but the whole inland and mountainous part of the country.</P>
<P>THOUGH in the progre&s;s of improvement and population, the price of the whole bea&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ri&s;es, yet the price of the carca&s;e is likely to be much more affected by this ri&s;e than that of the wool and the hide. The market for the carca&s;e, being in the rude &s;tate of &s;ociety confined always to the country which produces it, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be extended in proportion to the improvement
<PB N="289" REF="302">
and population of that country. But the market for the wool and the hides even of a barbarous country often extending to the whole commercial world, it can very &s;eldom be enlarged in the &s;ame proportion. The &s;tate of the whole commercial world can &s;eldom be much affected by the improvement of any particular country; and the market for &s;uch commodities may remain the &s;ame or very nearly the &s;ame, after &s;uch improvements, as before. It &s;hould however in the natural cour&s;e of things rather upon the whole be &s;omewhat extended in con&s;equence of them. If the manufactures, e&s;pecially, of which tho&s;e commodities are the materials, &s;hould ever come to flouri&s;h in the country, the market, though it might not be much enlarged, would at lea&s;t be brought much nearer to the place of growth than before; and the price of tho&s;e materials might at lea&s;t be increa&s;ed by what had u&s;ually been the expence of tran&s;porting them to di&s;tant countries. Though it might not ri&s;e therefore in the &s;ame proportion as that of butcher's-meat, it ought naturally to ri&s;e &s;omewhat, and it ought certainly not to fall.</P>
<P>IN England, however, notwith&s;tanding the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of its woollen manufacture, the price of Engli&s;h wool has fallen very con&s;iderably &s;ince the time of Edward III. There are many authentick records which demon&s;trate that during the reign of that prince (towards the middle of the fourteenth century, or about 1339) what was reckoned the moderate and rea&s;onable price of the tod or twenty-eight pounds of Engli&s;h wool was not le&s;s than ten &s;hillings of the money of tho&s;e times <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Smith's Memoirs of Wool.</NOTE>, containing, at the rate of twenty-pence the ounce, &s;ix ounces of &s;ilver Tower-weight, equal to about thirty &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money. In the pre&s;ent times, one and twenty &s;hillings the tod may be reckoned a good
<PB N="290" REF="303">
price for very good Engli&s;h wool. The money-price of wool, therefore, in the time of Edward III. was to its money-price in the pre&s;ent times as ten to &s;even. The &s;uperiority of its real price was &s;till greater. At the rate of &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence the quar|ter, ten &s;hillings was in tho&s;e ancient times the price of twelve bu&s;hels of wheat. At the rate of twenty-eight &s;hillings the quarter, one and twenty &s;hillings is in the pre&s;ent times the price of &s;ix bu&s;hels only. The proportion between the real prices of ancient and modern times, therefore, is as twelve to &s;ix, or as two to one. In tho&s;e ancient times a tod of wool would have purcha&s;ed twice the quantity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which it will purcha&s;e at pre&s;ent; and con&s;equently twice the quantity of labour, if the real recompence of labour had been the &s;ame in both periods.</P>
<P>THIS degradation both in the real and nominal value of wool could never have happened in con&s;equence of the natural cour&s;e of things. It has accordingly been the effect of violence and artifice: Fir&s;t, of the ab&s;olute prohibition of exporting wool from Eng|land; Secondly, of the permi&s;&s;ion of importing it from all other countries duty free; Thirdly, of the prohibition of exporting it from Ireland to any other country but England. In con&s;equence of the&s;e regulations, the market for Engli&s;h wool, in&s;tead of being &s;omewhat extended in con&s;equence of the improvement of England, has been confined to the home market, where the wool of all other countries is allowed to come into competition with it, and where that of Ireland is forced into competition with it. As the woollen manufactures too of Ireland are fully as much di&s;|couraged as is con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice and fair dealing, the Iri&s;h can work up but a &s;mall part of their own wool at home, and are, therefore, obliged to &s;end a greater proportion of it to Great Britain, the only market they are allowed.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="304">
I HAVE not been able to find any &s;uch authentick records con|cerning the price of raw hides in ancient times. Wool was com|monly paid as a &s;ub&s;idy to the king, and its valuation in that &s;ub&s;idy a&s;certains, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree, what was its ordinary price. But this &s;eems not to have been the ca&s;e with raw hides. Fleet|wood, however, from an account in 1425, between the prior of Burce&s;ter Oxford and one of his canons, gives us their price, at lea&s;t as it was &s;tated, upon that particular occa&s;ion: viz. five ox hides at twelve &s;hillings; five cow hides at &s;even &s;hillings and three-pence; thirty-&s;ix &s;heeps &s;kins of two years old at nine &s;hil|lings; &s;ixteen calves &s;kins at two &s;hillings. In 1425, twelve &s;hil|lings contained about the &s;ame quantity of &s;ilver as four and twenty &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money. An ox hide, therefore, was in this account valued at the &s;ame quantity of &s;ilver as 4s. &frac45;ths of our pre&s;ent money. Its nominal price was a good deal lower than at pre&s;ent. But at the rate of &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence the quarter, twelve &s;hillings would in tho&s;e times have purcha&s;ed fourteen bu&s;hels and four-fifths of a bu&s;hel of wheat, which, at three and &s;ix-pence the bu&s;hel, would in the pre&s;ent times co&s;t 51s. 4d. An ox hide, therefore, would in tho&s;e times have purcha&s;ed as much corn as ten &s;hillings and three-pence would purcha&s;e at pre&s;ent. Its real value was equal to ten &s;hillings and three-pence of our pre&s;ent money. In tho&s;e ancient times, when the cattle were half &s;tarved during the greater part of the winter, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that they were of a very large &s;ize. An ox hide which weighs four &s;tone of &s;ixteen pounds averdupois, is not in the pre&s;ent times reckoned a bad one; and in tho&s;e ancient times would probably have been reckoned a very good one. But at half a crown the &s;tone, which at this moment (February, 1773) I under&s;tand to be the common price, &s;uch a hide would at pre&s;ent co&s;t only ten &s;hillings. Though its nominal price, therefore, is higher in the pre&s;ent than it was in tho&s;e ancient times, its real
<PB N="292" REF="305">
price, the real quantity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which it will purcha&s;e or command, is rather &s;omewhat lower. The price of cow hides, as &s;tated in the above account, is nearly in the common proportion to that of ox hides. That of &s;heep &s;kins is a good deal above it. They had probably been &s;old with the wool. That of calves &s;kins, on the contrary, is greatly below it. In countries where the price of cattle is very low, the calves, which are not intended to be reared in order to keep up the &s;tock, are generally killed very young; as was the ca&s;e in Scotland twenty or thirty years ago. It &s;aves the milk, which their price would not pay for. Their &s;kins, therefore, are commonly good for little.</P>
<P>THE price of raw hides is a good deal lower at pre&s;ent than it was a few years ago; owing probably to the taking off the duty upon &s;eal &s;kins, and to the allowing, for a limited time, the importation of raw hides from Ireland and from the plantations duty free, which was done in 1769. Take the whole of the pre&s;ent century at an average, their real price has probably been &s;omewhat higher than it was in tho&s;e ancient times. The nature of the commodity renders it not quite &s;o proper for being tran|&s;ported to di&s;tant markets as wool. It &s;uffers more by keeping. A &s;alted hide is reckoned inferior to a fre&s;h one, and &s;ells for a lower price. This circum&s;tance mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have &s;ome ten|dency to &s;ink the price of raw hides produced in a country which does not manufacture them, but is obliged to export them; and comparatively to rai&s;e that of tho&s;e produced in a country which does manufacture them. It mu&s;t have &s;ome tendency to &s;ink their price in a barbarous, and to rai&s;e it in an improved and manu|facturing country. It mu&s;t have had &s;ome tendency therefore to &s;ink it in ancient, and to rai&s;e it in modern times. Our tanners be&s;ides have not been quite &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as our clothiers in con|vincing the wi&s;dom of the nation that the &s;afety of the common|wealth
<PB N="293" REF="306">
depends upon the pro&s;perity of their particular manufacture. They have accordingly been much le&s;s favoured. The exportation of raw hides has, indeed, been prohibited, and declared a nui|&s;ance: but their importation from foreign countries has been &s;ubjected to a duty; and though this duty has been taken off from tho&s;e of Ireland and the plantations (for the limited time of five years only) yet Ireland has not been confined to the market of Great Britain for the &s;ale of its &s;urplus hides, or of tho&s;e which are not manufactured at home. The hides of common cattle have but within the&s;e few years been put among the enumerated commo|dities which the plantations can &s;end nowhere but to the mother country; neither has the commerce of Ireland been in this ca&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed hitherto in order to &s;upport the manufactures of Great Britain.</P>
<P>WHATEVER regulations tend to &s;ink the price either of wool or of raw hides below what it naturally would be, mu&s;t, in an improved and cultivated country, have &s;ome tendency to rai&s;e the price of butcher's-meat. The price both of the great and &s;mall cattle, which are fed on improved and cultivated land, mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to pay the rent which the landlord, and the profit which the farmer has rea&s;on to expect from improved and cultivated land. If it is not, they will &s;oon cea&s;e to feed them. Whatever part of this price, therefore, is not paid by the wool and the hide, mu&s;t be paid by the carca&s;e. The le&s;s there is paid for the one, the more mu&s;t be paid for the other. In what manner this price is to be divided upon the different parts of the bea&s;t, is indifferent to the landlords and farmers, provided it is all paid to them. In an improved and cultivated country, therefore, their intere&s;t as landlords and farmers cannot be much affected by &s;uch regula|tions, though their intere&s;t as con&s;umers may, by the ri&s;e in the price of provi&s;ions. It would be quite otherwi&s;e, however, in an
<PB N="291" REF="307">
unimproved and uncultivated country, where the greater part of the lands could be applied to no other purpo&s;e but the feeding of cattle, and where the wool and the hide made the principal part of the value of tho&s;e cattle. Their intere&s;t as landlords and farmers would in this ca&s;e be very deeply affected by &s;uch regulations, and their intere&s;t as con&s;umers very little. The fall in the price of the wool and the hide, would not in this ca&s;e rai&s;e the price of the carca&s;e; becau&s;e the greater part of the lands of the country being applicable to no other purpo&s;e but the feeding of cattle, the &s;ame number would &s;till continue to be fed. The &s;ame quantity of butcher's-meat would &s;till come to market. The demand for it would be no greater than before. Its price, therefore, would be the &s;ame as before. The whole price of cattle would fall, and along with it both the rent and the profit of all tho&s;e lands of which cattle was the principal produce, that is, of the greater part of the lands of the country. The perpetual prohibition of the exportation of wool which is commonly, but very fal&s;ely, a&s;cribed to Edward III, would, in the then circum&s;tances of the country, have been the mo&s;t de&s;tructive regulation which could well have been thought of. It would not only have reduced the actual value of the greater part of the lands of the kingdom, but by reducing the price of the mo&s;t important &s;pecies of &s;mall cattle, it would have retarded very much its &s;ub&s;equent improvement.</P>
<P>THE wool of Scotland fell very con&s;iderably in its price in con|&s;equence of the union with England, by which it was excluded from the great market of Europe, and confined to the narrow one of Great Britain. The value of the greater part of the lands in the &s;outhern counties of Scotland, which are chiefly a &s;heep country, would have been very deeply affected by this event, had not the ri&s;e in the price of butcher's-meat fully compen&s;ated the fall in the price of wool.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="308">
AS the efficacy of human indu&s;try, in increa&s;ing the quantity either of wool or of raw hides, is limited, &s;o far as it depends upon the produce of the country where it is exerted; &s;o it is uncertain &s;o far as it depends upon the produce of other countries. It &s;o far depends, not &s;o much upon the quantity which they produce, as upon that which they do not manufacture; and upon the re&s;traints which they may or may not think proper to impo&s;e upon the ex|portation of this &s;ort of rude produce. The&s;e circum&s;tances, as they are altogether independent of dome&s;tick indu&s;try, &s;o they nece&s;&s;arily render the efficacy of its efforts more or le&s;s uncertain. In multiplying this &s;ort of rude produce, therefore, the efficacy of human indu&s;try is not only limited, but uncertain.</P>
<P>IN multiplying another very important &s;ort of rude produce, the quantity of fi&s;h that is brought to market, it is likewi&s;e both limited and uncertain. It is limited by the local &s;ituation of the country, by the proximity or di&s;tance of its different provinces from the &s;ea, by the number of its lakes and rivers, and by what may be called the fertility or barrenne&s;s of tho&s;e &s;eas, lakes and rivers, as to this &s;ort of rude produce. As population increa&s;es, as the annual produce of the land and labour of the country grows greater and greater, there come to be more buyers of fi&s;h, and tho&s;e buyers too have a greater quantity and variety of other goods, or, what is the &s;ame thing, the price of a greater quantity and variety of other goods, to buy with. But it will generally be im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;upply the great and extended market without employing a quantity of labour greater than in proportion to what had been re|qui&s;ite for &s;upplying the narrow and confined one. A market which, from requiring only one thou&s;and, comes to require annually ten thou&s;and tun of fi&s;h, can &s;eldom be &s;upplied without employing more than ten times the quantity of labour which had before been &s;ufficient to &s;upply it. The fi&s;h mu&s;t generally be &s;ought for at a
<PB N="296" REF="309">
greater di&s;tance, larger ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t be employed, and more ex|pen&s;ive machinery of every kind made u&s;e of. The real price of this commodity, therefore, naturally ri&s;es in the progre&s;s of improvement. It has accordingly done &s;o, I believe, more or le&s;s in every country.</P>
<P>THOUGH the &s;ucce&s;s of a particular day's fi&s;hing may be a very uncertain matter, yet, the local &s;ituation of the country being &s;uppo&s;ed, the general efficacy of indu&s;try in bringing a certain quantity of fi&s;h to market, taking the cour&s;e of a year, or of &s;everal years together, it may perhaps be thought, is certain enough; and it, no doubt, is &s;o. As it depends more, however, upon the local &s;ituation of the country, than upon the &s;tate of its wealth and indu&s;try; as upon this account it may in different countries be the &s;ame in very different periods of improvement, and very different in the &s;ame period; its connection with the &s;tate of improvement is uncertain, and it is of this &s;ort of uncertainty that I am here &s;peaking.</P>
<P>IN increa&s;ing the quantity of the different minerals and metals which are drawn from the bowels of the earth, that of the more precious ones particularly, the efficacy of human indu&s;try &s;eems not to be limited, but to be altogether uncertain.</P>
<P>THE quantity of the precious metals which is to be found in any country is not limited by any thing in its local &s;ituation, &s;uch as the fertility or barrenne&s;s of its own mines. Tho&s;e metals frequently abound in countries which po&s;&s;e&s;s no mines. Their quantity in every particular country &s;eems to depend upon two dif|ferent circum&s;tances; fir&s;t, upon its power of purcha&s;ing, upon the &s;tate of its indu&s;try, upon the annual produce of its land and la|bour, in con&s;equence of which it can afford to employ a greater
<PB N="297" REF="310">
or a &s;maller quantity of labour and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in bringing or purcha&s;ing &s;uch &s;uperfluities as gold and &s;ilver, either from its own mines or from tho&s;e of other countries; and, &s;econdly, upon the fertility or barrenne&s;s of the mines which may happen at any particular time to &s;upply the commercial world with tho&s;e metals. The quantity of tho&s;e metals in the countries mo&s;t remote from the mines, mu&s;t be more or le&s;s affected by this fertility or barren|ne&s;s, on account of the ea&s;y and cheap tran&s;portation of tho&s;e metals, of their &s;mall bulk and great value. Their quantity in China and Indo&s;tan mu&s;t have been more or le&s;s affected by the abundance of the mines of America.</P>
<P>So far as their quantity in any particular country depends upon the former of tho&s;e two circum&s;tances (the power of purcha&s;ing) their real price, like that of all other luxuries and &s;uperfluities, is likely to ri&s;e with the wealth and improvement of the country, and to fall with its poverty and depre&s;&s;ion. Countries which have a great quantity of labour and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to &s;pare, can afford to purcha&s;e any particular quantity of tho&s;e metals at the expence of a greater quantity of labour and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, than countries which have le&s;s to &s;pare.</P>
<P>So far as their quantity in any particular country depends upon the latter of tho&s;e two circum&s;tances (the fertility or barrenne&s;s of the mines which happen to &s;upply the commercial world) their real price, the real quantity of labour and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which they will purcha&s;e or exchange for, will, no doubt, &s;ink more or le&s;s in proportion to the fertility, and ri&s;e in proportion to the barren|ne&s;s of tho&s;e mines.</P>
<P>THE fertility or barrenne&s;s of the mines, however, which may happen at any particular time to &s;upply the commercial world,
<PB N="298" REF="311">
is a circum&s;tance which, it is evident, may have no &s;ort of con|nection with the &s;tate of indu&s;try in a particular country. It &s;eems even to have no very nece&s;&s;ary connection with that of the world in general. As arts and commerce, indeed, gradually &s;pread them&s;elves over a greater and a greater part of the earth, the &s;earch for new mines, being extended over a wider &s;urface, may have &s;omewhat a better chance for being &s;ucce&s;sful, than when confined within narrower bounds. The di&s;covery of new mines, however, as the old ones come to be gradually exhau&s;ted, is a matter of the greate&s;t uncertainty, and &s;uch as no human &s;kill or indu&s;try can en&s;ure. All indications, it is acknowledged, are doubtful, and the actual di&s;covery and &s;ucce&s;sful working of a new mine can alone a&s;certain the reality of its value, or even of its exi&s;tence. In this &s;earch there &s;eem to be no certain limits either to the po&s;&s;ible &s;ucce&s;s, or to the po&s;&s;ible di&s;appointment of human indu&s;try. In the cour&s;e of a century or two, it is po&s;&s;ible that new mines may be di&s;covered more fertile than any that have ever yet been known; and it is ju&s;t equally po&s;&s;ible that the mo&s;t fertile mine then known may be more barren than any that was wrought before the di&s;|covery of the mines of America. Whether the one or the other of tho&s;e two events may happen to take place, is of very little im|portance to the real wealth and pro&s;perity of the world, to the real value of the annual produce of the land and labour of man|kind. Its nominal value, the quantity of gold and &s;ilver by which this annual produce could be expre&s;&s;ed or repre&s;ented, would, no doubt, be very different; but its real value, the real quantity of labour which it could purcha&s;e or command, would be preci&s;ely the &s;ame. A &s;hilling might in the one ca&s;e repre&s;ent no more la|bour than a penny does at pre&s;ent; and a penny in the other might repre&s;ent as much as a &s;hilling does now. But in the one ca&s;e he who had a &s;hilling in his pocket, would be no richer than he who has a penny at pre&s;ent; and in the other he who had a penny
<PB N="299" REF="312">
would be ju&s;t as rich as he who has a &s;hilling now. The cheapne&s;s and abundance of gold and &s;ilver plate, would be the &s;ole advantage which the world could derive from the one event, and the dear|ne&s;s and &s;carcity of tho&s;e trifling &s;uperfluities the only inconveniency it could &s;uffer from the other.</P>

<HEAD>Conclu&s;ion of the Digre&s;&s;ion concerning the Variations in the Value of Silver.</HEAD>
<P>THE greater part of the writers who have collected the money prices of things in antient times, &s;eem to have con&s;idered the low money price of corn, and of goods in general, or, in other words, the high value of gold and &s;ilver, as a proof, not only of the &s;carcity of tho&s;e metals, but of the poverty and barbari&s;m of the country at the time when it took place. This notion is con|nected with the &s;y&s;tem of political oeconomy which repre&s;ents na|tional wealth as con&s;i&s;ting in the abundance, and national poverty in the &s;carcity of gold and &s;ilver; a &s;y&s;tem which I &s;hall endeavour to explain and examine at great length in the fourth book of this enquiry. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve at pre&s;ent, that the high value of the precious metals can be no proof of the poverty or barbari&s;m of any particular country at the time when it took place. It is a proof only of the barrenne&s;s of the mines which happened at that time to &s;upply the commercial world. A poor country, as it cannot afford to buy more, &s;o it can as little afford to pay dearer for gold and &s;ilver than a rich one; and the value of tho&s;e metals, therefore, is not likely to be higher in the former than in the latter. In China, a country much richer than any part of Eu|rope, the value of the precious metals is much higher than in any part of Europe. As the wealth of Europe, indeed, has increa&s;ed greatly &s;ince the di&s;covery of the mines of America, &s;o the value
<PB N="300" REF="313">
of gold and &s;ilver has gradually dimini&s;hed. This diminution of their value, however, has not been owing to the increa&s;e of the real wealth of Europe, of the annual produce of its land and la|bour, but to the accidental di&s;covery of more abundant mines than any that were known before. The increa&s;e of the quantity of gold and &s;ilver in Europe, and the increa&s;e of its manufactures and agri|culture, are two events which, though they have happened nearly about the &s;ame time, yet have ari&s;en from very different cau&s;es, and have &s;carce any natural connection with one another. The one has ari&s;en from a mere accident, in which neither prudence nor policy either had or could have any &s;hare: The other from the fall of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, and from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a government which afforded to indu&s;try, the only encouragement which it requires, &s;ome tolerable &s;ecurity that it &s;hall enjoy the fruits of its own labour. Poland, where the feudal &s;y&s;tem &s;till continues to take place, is at this day as beggarly a country as it was before the di&s;covery of America. The money price of corn, however, has ri&s;en; the real value of the precious metals has fallen in Poland, in the &s;ame manner as in other parts of Europe. Their quantity, therefore, mu&s;t have increa&s;ed there as in other places, and nearly in the &s;ame proportion to the annual produce of its land and labour. This increa&s;e of the quantity of tho&s;e metals, however, has not, it &s;eems, increa&s;ed that annual produce, has neither improved the manufactures and agriculture of the country, nor mended the circum&s;tances of its inhabitants. Spain and Por|tugal, the countries which po&s;&s;e&s;s the mines, are, after Poland, perhaps, the two mo&s;t beggarly countries in Europe. The value of the precious metals, however, mu&s;t be lower in Spain and Portugal than in any other part of Europe; as they come from tho&s;e countries to all other parts of Europe, loaded, not only with a freight and an in&s;urance, but with the expence of &s;muggling, their exportation being either prohibited, or &s;ubjected to a duty. In
<PB N="301" REF="314">
proportion to the annual produce of the land and labour, there|fore, their quantity mu&s;t be greater in tho&s;e countries than in any other part of Europe: Tho&s;e countries, however, are poorer than the greater part of Europe. Though the feudal &s;y&s;tem has been aboli&s;hed in Spain and Portugal, it has not been &s;ucceeded by a much better.</P>
<P>AS the low value of gold and &s;ilver, therefore, is no proof of the wealth and flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the country where it takes place; &s;o neither is their high value, or the low money price either of goods in general or of corn in particular, any proof of its poverty and barbari&s;m.</P>
<P>BUT though the low money price either of goods in general, or of corn in particular, be no proof of the poverty or barbari&s;m of the times, the low money price of &s;ome particular &s;orts of goods, &s;uch as cattle, poultry, game of all kinds, in proportion to that of corn, is a mo&s;t deci&s;ive one. It clearly demon&s;trates, fir&s;t, their great abundance in proportion to that of corn, and con&s;equently the great extent of the land which they occupied in proportion to what was occupied by corn; and, &s;econdly, the low value of this land in proportion to that of corn land, and con&s;equently the un|cultivated and unimproved &s;tate of the far greater part of the lands of the country. It clearly demon&s;trates that the &s;tock and popu|lation of the country did not bear the &s;ame proportion to the ex|tent of its territory, which they commonly do in civilized countries, and that &s;ociety was at that time, and in that country, but in its infancy. From the high or low money price either of goods in general, or of corn in particular, we can infer only that the mines which at that time happened to &s;upply the commercial world with gold and &s;ilver, were fertile or barren, not that the country was rich or poor. But from the high or low money price of &s;ome
<PB N="302" REF="315">
&s;orts of goods in proportion to that of others, we can infer with a degree of probability that approaches almo&s;t to certainty, that it was rich or poor, that the greater part of its lands were improved or unimproved, and that it was either in a more or le&s;s barbarous &s;tate, or in a more or le&s;s civilized one.</P>
<P>ANY ri&s;e in the money price of goods which proceeded altogether from the degradation of the value of &s;ilver, would affect all &s;orts of goods equally, and rai&s;e their price univer&s;ally a third, or a fourth, or a fifth part higher, according as &s;ilver happened to lo&s;e a third, or a fourth, or a fifth part of its former value. But the ri&s;e in the price of provi&s;ions, which has been the &s;ubject of &s;o much rea&s;oning and conver&s;ation, does not affect all &s;orts of provi&s;ions equally. Taking the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century at an average, the price of corn, it is acknowledged, even by tho&s;e who account for this ri&s;e by the degradation of the value of &s;ilver, has ri&s;en much le&s;s than that of &s;ome other &s;orts of provi&s;ions. The ri&s;e in the price of tho&s;e other &s;orts of provi&s;ions, therefore, cannot be owing altogether to the degradation of the value of &s;ilver. Some other cau&s;es mu&s;t be taken into the account, and tho&s;e which have been above a&s;&s;igned, will, perhaps, without having recour&s;e to the &s;uppo&s;ed degradation of the value of &s;ilver, &s;ufficiently explain this ri&s;e in tho&s;e particular &s;orts of provi&s;ions of which the price has actually ri&s;en in proportion to that of corn.</P>
<P>AS to the price of corn it&s;elf, it has, during the &s;ixty-four fir&s;t years of the pre&s;ent century, and before the late extraordinary cour&s;e of bad &s;ea&s;ons, been &s;omewhat lower than it was during the &s;ixty|four la&s;t years of the preceding century. This fact is atte&s;ted, not only by the accounts of Wind&s;or market, but by the publick fiars of all the different counties of Scotland, and by the accounts
<PB N="303" REF="316">
of &s;everal different markets in France, which have been collected with great diligence and fidelity by Mr. Me&s;&s;ance and by Mr. Dupr&egrave; de St. Maur. The evidence is more compleat than could well have been expected in a matter which is naturally &s;o very difficult to be a&s;certained.</P>
<P>AS to the high price of corn during the&s;e la&s;t ten or twelve years, it can be &s;ufficiently accounted for from the badne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;ons, without &s;uppo&s;ing any degradation in the value of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>THE opinion, therefore, that &s;ilver is continually &s;inking in its value, &s;eems not to be founded upon any good ob&s;ervations, either upon the prices of corn, or upon tho&s;e of other provi|&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame quantity of &s;ilver, it may, perhaps, be &s;aid, will in the pre&s;ent times, even according to the account which has been here given, purcha&s;e a much &s;maller quantity of &s;everal &s;orts of provi&s;ions than it would have done during &s;ome part of the la&s;t century; and to a&s;certain whether this change be owing to a ri&s;e in the value of tho&s;e goods, or to a fall in the value of &s;ilver, is only to e&s;tabli&s;h a vain and u&s;ele&s;s di&s;tinction, which can be of no &s;ort of &s;ervice to the man who has only a certain quantity of &s;ilver to go to market with, or a certain fixed revenue in money. I cer|tainly do not pretend that the knowledge of this di&s;tinction will enable him to buy cheaper. It may not, however, upon that account, be altogether u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>IT may be of &s;ome u&s;e to the publick by affording an ea&s;y proof of the pro&s;perous condition of the country. If the ri&s;e in the price of &s;ome &s;orts of provi&s;ions be owing altogether to a fall in the value of &s;ilver, it is owing to a circum&s;tance from which nothing
<PB N="304" REF="317">
can be inferred but the fertility of the American mines. The real wealth of the country, the annual produce of its land and labour, may, notwith&s;tanding this circum&s;tance, be either gra|dually declining, as in Portugal and Poland; or gradually advancing, as in mo&s;t other parts of Europe. But if this ri&s;e in the price of &s;ome &s;orts of provi&s;ions be owing to a ri&s;e in the real value of the land which produces them, to its increa&s;ed fertility, or, in con&s;equence of more extended improvement and good culti|vation, to its having been rendered fit for producing corn, it is owing to a circum&s;tance which indicates in the cleare&s;t manner the pro&s;perous and advancing &s;tate of the country. The land con&s;titutes by far the greate&s;t, the mo&s;t important, and the mo&s;t durable part of the wealth of every exten&s;ive country. It may &s;urely be of &s;ome u&s;e, or, at lea&s;t, it may give &s;ome &s;atisfaction to the publick, to have &s;o deci&s;ive a proof of the increa&s;ing value of by far the greate&s;t, the mo&s;t important, and the mo&s;t durable part of its wealth.</P>
<P>IT may too be of &s;ome u&s;e to the publick in regulating the pecuniary reward of &s;ome of its inferior &s;ervants. If this ri&s;e in the price of &s;ome &s;orts of provi&s;ions be owing to a fall in the value of &s;ilver, their pecuniary reward, provided it was not too large before, ought certainly to be augmented in propor|tion to the extent of this fall. If it is not augmented, their real recompence will evidently be &s;o much dimini&s;hed. But if this ri&s;e of price is owing to the increa&s;ed value, in con&s;equence of the improved fertility of the land which produces &s;uch provi&s;ions, it becomes a much nicer matter to judge either in what proportion any pecuniary reward ought to be augmented, or whether it ought to be augmented at all. The exten&s;ion of improvement and cultivation, as it nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;es more or le&s;s, in proportion to the price of corn, that of every &s;ort of animal food, &s;o it as nece&s;&s;a|rily
<PB N="305" REF="318">
lowers that of, I believe, every &s;ort of vegetable food. It rai&s;es the price of animal food; becau&s;e a great part of the land which produces it, being rendered fit for producing corn, mu&s;t afford to the landlord and farmer the rent and profit of corn land. It lowers the price of vegetable food; becau&s;e by increa&s;ing the fertility of the land, it increa&s;es its abundance. The improve|ments of agriculture too introduce many &s;orts of vegetable food, which, requiring le&s;s land and not more labour than corn, come much cheaper to market. Such are potatoes and maize, or what is called Indian corn, the two mo&s;t important improvements which the agriculture of Europe, perhaps which Europe it&s;elf has received from the great exten&s;ion of its commerce and navi|gation. Many &s;orts of vegetable food be&s;ides, which in the rude &s;tate of agriculture are confined to the kitchen garden, and rai&s;ed only by the &s;pade, come in its improved &s;tate to be intro|duced into common fields, and to be rai&s;ed by the plough: &s;uch as turnips, carrots, cabbages, &amp;c. If in the progre&s;s of im|provement, therefore, the real price of one &s;pecies of food ne|ce&s;&s;arily ri&s;es, that of another as nece&s;&s;arily falls, and it becomes a matter of more nicety to judge how far the ri&s;e in the one may be compen&s;ated by the fall in the other. When the real price of butcher's meat has once got to its height, (which, with regard to every &s;ort, except perhaps that of hogs fle&s;h, it &s;eems to have done through a great part of England, more than a century ago) any ri&s;e which can afterwards happen in that of any other &s;ort of animal food, cannot much affect the circum&s;tances of the inferior ranks of people. The circum&s;tances of the poor through a great part of England cannot &s;urely be &s;o much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by any ri&s;e in the price of poultry, fi&s;h, wild-fowl, or veni&s;on, as they mu&s;t be relieved by the fall in that of potatoes.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on of &s;carcity the high price of corn no doubt di&s;tre&s;&s;es the poor. But in times of moderate plenty, when
<PB N="306" REF="319">
corn is at its ordinary or average price, the natural ri&s;e in the price of any other &s;ort of rude produce cannot much affect them. They &s;uffer more, perhaps, by the artificial ri&s;e which has been occa&s;ioned by taxes in the price of &s;ome manufactured com|modities; as of &s;alt, &s;oap, leather, candles, malt, beer and ale, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Effects of the Progre&s;s of Improvement upon the real Price of Manufactures.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the natural effect of improvement, however, to dimini&s;h gradually the real price of almo&s;t all manufactures. That of the manufacturing workman&s;hip dimini&s;hes perhaps in all of them without exception. In con&s;equence of better machinery, of greater dexterity, and of a more proper divi&s;ion and di&s;tribution of work, all of which are the natural effects of improvement, a much &s;maller quantity of labour becomes requi&s;ite for executing any particular piece of work; and though in con&s;equence of the flouri&s;hing circum&s;tances of the &s;ociety, the real price of labour &s;hould ri&s;e very con&s;iderably, yet the great diminution of the quantity will generally much more than compen&s;ate the greate&s;t ri&s;e which can happen in the price.</P>
<P>THERE are, indeed, a few manufactures, in which the nece&s;&s;ary ri&s;e in the real price of the rude materials will more than com|pen&s;ate all the advantages which improvement can introduce into the execution of the work. In carpenters and joiners work, and in the coar&s;er &s;ort of cabinet work, the nece&s;&s;ary ri&s;e in the real price of barren timber, in con&s;equence of the improvement of land, will more than compen&s;ate all the advantages which can
<PB N="307" REF="320">
be derived from the be&s;t machinery, the greate&s;t dexterity, and the mo&s;t proper divi&s;ion and di&s;tribution of work.</P>
<P>BUT in all ca&s;es in which the real price of the rude materials either does not ri&s;e at all, or does not ri&s;e very much, that of the manufactured commodity &s;inks very con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>THIS diminution of price has, in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent and preceeding century, been mo&s;t remarkable in tho&s;e manu|factures of which the materials are the coar&s;er metals. A better movement of a watch, than about the middle of the la&s;t century could have been bought for twenty pounds, may now perhaps be had for twenty &s;hillings. In the work of cutlers and lock|&s;miths, in all the toys which are made of the coar&s;er metals, and in all tho&s;e goods which are commonly known by the name of Birmingham and Sheffield ware, there has been, during the &s;ame period, a very great reduction of price, though not alto|gether &s;o great as in watch work. It has, however, been &s;uf|ficient to a&s;toni&s;h the workmen of every other part of Europe, who in many ca&s;es acknowledge that they can produce no work of equal goodne&s;s for double, or even for triple the price. There are perhaps no manufactures in which the divi&s;ion of labour can be carried further, or in which the machinery employed admits of a greater variety of improvements, than tho&s;e of which the materials are the coar&s;er metals.</P>
<P>IN the clothing manufacture there has, during the &s;ame period, been no &s;uch &s;en&s;ible reduction of price. The price of &s;uperfine cloth, I have been a&s;&s;ured, on the contrary, has, within the&s;e five and twenty or thirty years, ri&s;en &s;omewhat in proportion to its quality; owing, it was &s;aid, to a con&s;iderable ri&s;e in the price of the material, which con&s;i&s;ts altogether of Spani&s;h wool. That
<PB N="308" REF="321">
of the York&s;hire cloth, which is made altogether of Engli&s;h wool, is &s;aid indeed, during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century, to have fallen a good deal in proportion to its quality. Quality, however, is &s;o very di&s;putable a matter, that I look upon all informations of this kind as &s;omewhat uncertain. In the clothing manu|facture, the divi&s;ion of labour is nearly the &s;ame now, as it was a century ago, and the machinery employed is not very different. There may, however, have been &s;ome &s;mall improvements in both, which may have occa&s;ioned &s;ome reduction of price.</P>
<P>THE reduction, however, will appear much more &s;en&s;ible and undeniable, if we compare the price of this manufacture in the pre&s;ent times with what it was in a much remoter period, towards the end of the fifteenth century, when the labour was probably much le&s;s &s;ubdivided, and the machinery employed much more imperfect than it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>IN 1487, being the 4th of Henry VIIth, it was enacted, that <Q>who&s;oever &s;hall &s;ell by retail a broad yard of the fine&s;t &s;carlet grained, or of other grained cloth of the fine&s;t making, above &s;ixteen &s;hillings, &s;hall forfeit forty &s;hillings for every yard &s;o &s;old.</Q> Sixteen &s;hillings, therefore, containing about the &s;ame quantity of &s;ilver as four and twenty &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money, was, at that time, reckoned not an unrea&s;onable price for a yard of the fine&s;t cloth; and as this is a &s;umptuary law, &s;uch cloth, it is probable, had u&s;ually been &s;old &s;omewhat dearer. A guinea may be reckoned the highe&s;t price in the pre&s;ent times. Even though the quality of the cloths, therefore, &s;hould be &s;up|po&s;ed equal, and that of the pre&s;ent times is mo&s;t probably much &s;uperior, yet, even upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, the money price of the fine&s;t cloth appears to have been con&s;iderably reduced &s;ince the end of the fifteenth century. But its real price has been
<PB N="309" REF="322">
much more reduced. Six &s;hillings and eight-pence was then, and long afterwards, reckoned the average price of a quarter of wheat. Sixteen &s;hillings, therefore, was the price of two quarters and more than three bu&s;hels of wheat. Valuing a quarter of wheat in the pre&s;ent times at eight and twenty &s;hillings, the real price of a yard of fine cloth mu&s;t, in tho&s;e times, have been equal to at lea&s;t three pounds &s;ix &s;hillings and &s;ixpence of our pre&s;ent money. The man who bought it mu&s;t have parted with the command of a quantity of labour and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence equal to what that &s;um would purcha&s;e in the pre&s;ent times.</P>
<P>THE reduction in the real price of the coar&s;e manufacture, though con&s;iderable, has not been &s;o great as in that of the fine.</P>
<P>IN 1463, being the 3d of Edward IVth, it was enacted, that <Q>no &s;ervant in hu&s;bandry, nor common labourer, nor &s;ervant to any artificer inhabiting out of a city or burgh, &s;hall u&s;e or wear in their cloathing any cloth above two &s;hillings the broad yard.</Q> In the 3d of Edward the IVth, two &s;hillings contained very nearly the &s;ame quantity of &s;ilver as four of our pre&s;ent money. But the York&s;hire cloth which is now &s;old at four &s;hillings the yard, is probably much &s;uperior to any that was then made for the wearing of the very poore&s;t order of com|mon &s;ervants. Even the money price of their cloathing, therefore, may, in proportion to the quality, be &s;omewhat cheaper in the pre&s;ent than it was in tho&s;e antient times. The real price is certainly a good deal cheaper. Ten pence was then reckoned what is called the moderate and rea&s;onable price of a bu&s;hel of wheat. Two &s;hillings, therefore, was the price of two bu&s;hels and near two pecks of wheat, which in the pre&s;ent times, at three &s;hillings and &s;ixpence the bu&s;hel, would be worth eight &s;hillings and
<PB N="310" REF="323">
nine-pence. For a yard of this cloth the poor &s;ervant mu&s;t have parted with the power of purcha&s;ing a quantity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence equal to what eight &s;hillings and nine-pence would purcha&s;e in the pre&s;ent times. This is a &s;umptuary law too, re&s;training the luxury and extravagance of the poor. Their cloathing, there|fore, had commonly been much more expen&s;ive.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame order of people are, by the &s;ame law, prohibited from wearing ho&s;e, of which the price &s;hould exceed fourteen-pence the pair, equal to about eight and twenty pence of our pre&s;ent money. But fourteen-pence was in tho&s;e times the price of a bu&s;hel and near two pecks of wheat; which in the pre&s;ent times, at three and &s;ixpence the bu&s;hel, would co&s;t five &s;hillings and three-pence. We &s;hould in the pre&s;ent times con&s;ider this as a very high price for a pair of &s;tockings to a &s;ervant of the poore&s;t and lowe&s;t order. He mu&s;t, however, in tho&s;e times have paid what was really equivalent to this price for them.</P>
<P>IN the time of Edward IVth, the art of knitting &s;tockings was probably not known in any part of Europe. Their ho&s;e were made of common cloth, which may have been one of the cau&s;es of their dearne&s;s. The fir&s;t per&s;on that wore &s;tockings in England is &s;aid to have been Queen Elizabeth. She received them as a pre&s;ent from the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>BOTH in the coar&s;e and in the fine woollen manufacture, the machinery employed was much more imperfect in tho&s;e antient, than it is in the pre&s;ent times. It has &s;ince received three very capital improvements, be&s;ides, probably, many &s;maller ones of which it may be difficult to a&s;certain either the number or the importance. The three capital improvements are; fir&s;t, The exchange of the rock and &s;pindle for the &s;pinning wheel, which,
<PB N="311" REF="324">
with the &s;ame quantity of labour, will perform more than double the quantity of work. Secondly, the u&s;e of &s;everal very ingenious machines which facilitate and abridge in a &s;till greater proportion the winding of the wor&s;ted and woollen yarn, or the proper arrangement of the warp and woof before they are put into the loom; an operation which, previous to the invention of tho&s;e machines, mu&s;t have been extreamly tedious and trouble&s;ome. Thirdly, The employment, of the fulling-mill for thickening the cloth, in&s;tead of treading it in water. Neither wind nor water mills of any kind were known in England &s;o early as the begin|ning of the &s;ixteenth century, nor, &s;o far as I know, in any other part of Europe north of the Alps. They had been intro|duced into Italy &s;ome time before.</P>
<P>THE con&s;ideration of the&s;e circum&s;tances may, perhaps, in &s;ome mea&s;ure explain to us why the real price both of the coar&s;e and of the fine manufacture, was &s;o much higher in tho&s;e antient, than it is in the pre&s;ent times. It co&s;t a greater quantity of labour to bring the goods to market. When they were brought thither, therefore, they mu&s;t have purcha&s;ed or exchanged for the price of a greater quantity.</P>
<P>THE coar&s;e manufacture probably was, in tho&s;e antient times, carried on in England, in the &s;ame manner as it always has been in countries where arts and manufactures are in their infancy. It was probably a hou&s;hold manufacture, in which every different part of the work was occa&s;ionally performed by all the different members of almo&s;t every private family; but &s;o as to be their work only when they had nothing el&s;e to do, and not to be the principal bu&s;ine&s;s from which any of them derived the greater part of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The work which is per|formed in this manner, it has already been ob&s;erved, comes always
<PB N="312" REF="325">
much cheaper to market than that which is the principal or &s;ole fund of the workman's &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The fine manufacture, on the other hand, was not in tho&s;e times carried on in England, but in the rich and commercial country of Flanders; and it was probably conducted then, in the &s;ame manner as now, by people who derived the whole, or the principal part of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from it. It was be&s;ides a foreign manufacture, and mu&s;t have paid &s;ome duty, the antient cu&s;tom of tunnage and poundage at lea&s;t, to the king. This duty, indeed, would not probably be very great. It was not then the policy of Europe to re&s;train, by high duties, the importation of foreign manufactures, but rather to encourage it, in order that merchants might be enabled to &s;upply, at as ea&s;y a rate as po&s;&s;ible, the great men with the con|veniencies and luxuries which they wanted, and which the indu&s;try of their own country could not afford them.</P>
<P>THE con&s;ideration of the&s;e circum&s;tances may, perhaps, in &s;ome mea&s;ure explain to us why, in tho&s;e antient times, the real price of the coar&s;e manufacture was, in proportion to that of the fine, &s;o much lower than in the pre&s;ent times.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="conclusion to chapter">
<HEAD>CONCLUSION <HI>of the</HI> CHAPTER.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL conclude this very long chapter with ob&s;erving that every improvement in the circum&s;tances of the &s;ociety tends either directly or indirectly to rai&s;e the real rent of land, to increa&s;e the real wealth of the landlord, his power of pur|cha&s;ing the labour, or the produce of the labour of other people.</P>
<P>THE exten&s;ion of improvement and cultivation tends to rai&s;e it directly. The landlord's &s;hare of the produce nece&s;&s;arily in|crea&s;es with the increa&s;e of the produce.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="326">
THAT ri&s;e in the real price of tho&s;e parts of the rude pro|duce of land, which is fir&s;t the effect of extended improvement and cultivation, and afterwards the cau&s;e of their being &s;till further extended, the ri&s;e in the price of cattle, for example, tends too to rai&s;e the rent of land directly, and in a &s;till greater proportion. The real value of the landlord's &s;hare, his real com|mand of the labour of other people, not only ri&s;es with the real value of the produce, but the proportion of his &s;hare to the whole produce ri&s;es with it. That produce, after the ri&s;e in its real price, requires no more labour to collect it than before. A &s;maller pro|portion of it will, therefore, be &s;ufficient to replace, with the ordinary profit, the &s;tock which employs that labour. A greater proportion of it mu&s;t, con&s;equently, belong to the landlord.</P>
<P>ALL tho&s;e improvements in the productive powers of labour, which tend directly to reduce the real price of manufactures, tend indirectly to rai&s;e the real rent of land. The landlord exchanges that part of his rude produce, which is over and above his own con&s;umption, or what comes to the &s;ame thing, the price of that part of it, for manufactured produce. Whatever reduces the real price of the latter, rai&s;es that of the former. An equal quantity of the former becomes thereby equivalent to a greater quantity of the latter; and the landlord is enabled to purcha&s;e a greater quantity of the conveniencies, ornaments, or luxuries, which he has occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>EVERY increa&s;e in the real wealth of the &s;ociety, every increa&s;e in the quantity of u&s;eful labour employed within it, tends indirectly to rai&s;e the real rent of land. A certain proportion of this labour naturally goes to the land. A greater number of men and cattle are employed in its cultivation, the produce increa&s;es with the increa&s;e of the &s;tock which is thus employed in rai&s;ing it, and the rent increa&s;es with the produce.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="327">
THE contrary circum&s;tances, the neglect of cultivation and im|provement, the fall in the real price of any part of the rude produce of land, the ri&s;e in the real price of manufactures from the decay of manufacturing art and indu&s;try, the declen&s;ion of the real wealth of the &s;ociety, all tend, on the other hand, to lower the real rent of land, to reduce the real wealth of the landlord, to dimini&s;h his power of purcha&s;ing either the labour, or the produce of the labour of other people.</P>
<P>THE whole annual produce of the land and labour of every country, or what comes to the &s;ame thing, the whole price of that annual produce, naturally divides it&s;elf, it has already been ob&s;erved, into three parts; the rent of land, the wages of labour, and the profits of &s;tock; and con&s;titutes a revenue to three different orders of people; to tho&s;e who live by rent, to tho&s;e who live by wages, and to tho&s;e who live by profit. The&s;e are the three great original and con&s;tituent orders of every civilized &s;ociety, from who&s;e revenue that of every other order is ultimately derived.</P>
<P>THE intere&s;t of the fir&s;t of tho&s;e three great orders, it appears from what has been ju&s;t now &s;aid, is &s;trictly and in&s;eparably con|nected with the general intere&s;t of the &s;ociety. Whatever either pro|motes or ob&s;tructs the one, nece&s;&s;arily promotes or ob&s;tructs the other. When the publick deliberates concerning any regulation of commerce or police, the proprietors of land never can mi&s;lead it, with a view to promote the intere&s;t of their own particular order; at lea&s;t, if they have any tolerable knowledge of that intere&s;t. They are, indeed, too often defective in this tolerable knowledge. They are the only one of the three orders who&s;e revenue co&s;ts them neither labour nor care, but comes to them, as it were, of its own accord, and independent of any plan or project of their own. That indolence which is the natural effect of the ea&s;e and &s;ecurity of their &s;ituation, renders them too
<PB N="315" REF="328">
often, not only ignorant, but incapable of that application of mind which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to fore&s;ee and under&s;tand the con&s;e|quences of any publick regulation.</P>
<P>THE intere&s;t of the &s;econd order, that of tho&s;e who live by wages, is as &s;trictly connected with the intere&s;t of the &s;ociety as that of the fir&s;t. The wages of the labourer, it has already been &s;hewn, are never &s;o high as when the demand for labour is continually ri&s;ing, or when the quantity employed is every year increa&s;ing con&s;iderably. When this real wealth of the &s;ociety becomes &s;tationary, his wages are &s;oon reduced to what is barely enough to enable him to bring up a family, or to continue the race of labourers. When the &s;ociety declines, they fall even below this. The order of proprietors may, perhaps, gain more by the pro&s;perity of the &s;ociety, than that of labourers: but there is no order that &s;uffers &s;o cruelly from its decline. But though the intere&s;t of the labourer is &s;trictly connected with that of the &s;ociety, he is incapa|ble either of comprehending that intere&s;t, or of under&s;tanding its connection with his own. His condition leaves him no time to receive the nece&s;&s;ary information, and his education and habits are commonly &s;uch as to render him unfit to judge even though he was fully informed. In the publick deliberations, therefore, his voice is little heard and le&s;s regarded, except upon &s;ome particular occa&s;ions, when his clamour is animated, &s;et on, and &s;up|ported by his employers, not for his, but their own particular purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>HIS employers con&s;titute the third order, that of tho&s;e who live by profit. It is the &s;tock that is employed for the &s;ake of profit, which puts into motion the greater part of the u&s;eful labour of every &s;ociety. The plans and projects of the employers of &s;tock regulate and direct all the mo&s;t important operations of labour, and
<PB N="316" REF="329">
profit is the end propo&s;ed by all tho&s;e plans and projects. But the rate of profit does not, like rent and wages, ri&s;e with the pro&s;perity, and fall with the declen&s;ion of the &s;ociety. On the contrary, it is naturally low in rich, and high in poor countries, and it is always highe&s;t in the countries which are going fa&s;te&s;t to ruin. The intere&s;t of this third order, therefore, has not the &s;ame connection with the general intere&s;t of the &s;ociety as that of the other two. Merchants and ma&s;ter manufacturers are, in this order, the two cla&s;&s;es of people who commonly employ the large&s;t capitals, and who by their wealth draw to them&s;elves the greate&s;t &s;hare of the publick con&s;ideration. As during their whole lives they are engaged in plans and projects, they have frequently more acutene&s;s of under|&s;tanding than the greater part of country gentlemen. As their thoughts, however, are commonly exerci&s;ed rather about the intere&s;t of their own particular branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, than about that of the &s;ociety, their judgement, even when given with the greate&s;t candour, (which it has not been upon every occa&s;ion), is much more to be depended upon with regard to the former of tho&s;e two objects, than with regard to the latter. Their &s;uperiority over the country gentle|man is, not &s;o much in their knowledge of the publick intere&s;t, as in their having a better knowledge of their own intere&s;t than he has of his. It is by this &s;uperior knowledge of their own intere&s;t that they have frequently impo&s;ed upon his genero&s;ity, and per&s;uaded him to give up both his own intere&s;t and that of the publick, from a very &s;imple but hone&s;t conviction, that their intere&s;t, and not his, was the intere&s;t of the publick. The intere&s;t of the dealers, however, in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in &s;ome re&s;pects different from, and even oppo&s;ite to that of the publick. To widen the market and to narrow the competition, is always the intere&s;t of the dealers. To widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the intere&s;t of the publick; but to narrow the competition mu&s;t always be again&s;t it, and can &s;erve only to enable
<PB N="317" REF="330">
the dealers, by rai&s;ing their profits above what they naturally would be, to levy, for their own benefit, an ab&s;urd tax upon the re&s;t of their fellow citizens. The propo&s;al of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be li&s;tened to with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous, but with the mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious attention. It comes from an order of men, who&s;e intere&s;t is never exactly the &s;ame with that of the publick, who have generally an intere&s;t to deceive and even to oppre&s;s the publick, and who accordingly have, upon many occa&s;ions, both deceived and oppre&s;&s;ed it.

<HEAD>BOOK II. Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN that rude &s;tate of &s;ociety in which there is no divi&s;ion of labour, in which exchanges are &s;eldom made, and in which every man provides every thing for him&s;elf, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that any &s;tock &s;hould be accumulated or &s;tored up beforehand in order to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;ociety. Every man endeavours to &s;upply by his own indu&s;try his own occa&s;ional wants as they occur. When he is hungry, he goes to the fore&s;t to hunt: when his coat is worn out, he cloaths him&s;elf with the &s;kin of the fir&s;t large animal he kills: and when his hut begins to go to ruin, he repairs it, as well as he can, with the trees and the turf that are neare&s;t it.</P>
<P>BUT when the divi&s;ion of labour has once been thoroughly in|troduced, the produce of a man's own labour can &s;upply but a very &s;mall part of his occa&s;ional wants. The far greater part of them are &s;upplied by the produce of other mens labour, which he purcha&s;es with the produce, or, what is the &s;ame thing, with the price of the produce of his own. But this purcha&s;e cannot be made till &s;uch time as the produce of his own labour has not only been compleated, but &s;old. A &s;tock of goods of different kinds,
<PB N="328" REF="340">
therefore, mu&s;t be &s;tored up &s;omewhere &s;ufficient to maintain him, and to &s;upply him with the materials and tools of his work till &s;uch time, at lea&s;t, as both the&s;e events can be brought about. A weaver cannot apply him&s;elf entirely to his peculiar bu&s;ine&s;s, unle&s;s there is beforehand &s;tored up &s;omewhere, either in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or in that of &s;ome other per&s;on, a &s;tock &s;ufficient to maintain him, and to &s;upply him with the materials and tools of his work, till he has not only compleated, but &s;old his web. This accumulation mu&s;t, evidently, be previous to his applying his indu&s;try for &s;o long a time to &s;uch a peculiar bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>AS the accumulation of &s;tock mu&s;t, in the nature of things, be previous to the divi&s;ion of labour, &s;o labour can be more and more &s;ubdivided only in proportion as &s;tock is previou&s;ly more and more accumulated. The quantity of materials which the &s;ame number of people can work up, increa&s;es in a great proportion as labour comes to be more and more &s;ubdivided; and as the operations of each workman are gradually reduced to a greater degree of &s;impli|city, a variety of new machines come to be invented for facilitating and abridging tho&s;e operations. As the divi&s;ion of labour advances, therefore, in order to give con&s;tant employment to an equal num|ber of workmen, an equal &s;tock of provi&s;ions, and a greater &s;tock of materials and tools than what would have been nece&s;&s;ary in a ruder &s;tate of things, mu&s;t be accumulated beforehand. But the number of workmen in every branch of bu&s;ine&s;s generally increa&s;es with the divi&s;ion of labour in that branch, or rather it is the increa&s;e of their number which enables them to cla&s;s and &s;ubdivide them&s;elves in this manner.</P>
<P>AS the accumulation of &s;tock is previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on this great improvement in the productive powers of labour, &s;o that accumulation naturally leads to this improvement. The
<PB N="329" REF="341">
per&s;on who employs his &s;tock in maintaining labour, nece&s;&s;arily wi&s;hes to employ it in &s;uch a manner as to produce as great a quantity of work as po&s;&s;ible. He endeavours, therefore, both to make among his workmen the mo&s;t proper di&s;tribution of employ|ment, and to furni&s;h them with the be&s;t machines which he can either invent or afford to purcha&s;e. His abilities in both the&s;e re&s;pects are generally in proportion to the extent of his &s;tock, or to the number of people whom it can employ. The quantity of indu&s;try, therefore, not only increa&s;es in every country with the increa&s;e of the &s;tock which employs it, but, in con&s;equence of that increa&s;e, the &s;ame quantity of indu&s;try produces a much greater quantity of work.</P>
<P>SUCH are in general the effects of the increa&s;e of &s;tock upon indu&s;try and its productive powers.</P>
<P>IN the following book I have endeavoured to explain the nature of &s;tock, the effects of its accumulation into capitals of different kinds, and the effects of the different employments of tho&s;e capi|tals. This book is divided into five chapters. In the fir&s;t chapter, I have endeavoured to &s;how what are the different parts or branches into which the &s;tock, either of an individual, or of a great &s;ociety, naturally divides it&s;elf. In the &s;econd, I have endeavoured to explain the nature and operation of money con&s;idered as a particu|lar branch of the general &s;tock of the &s;ociety. The &s;tock which is accumulated into a capital, may either be employed by the per&s;on to whom it belongs, or it may be lent to &s;ome other per&s;on. In the third and fourth chapters, I have endeavoured to examine the manner in which it operates in both the&s;e &s;ituations. The fifth and la&s;t chapter treats of the different effects which the different employments of capital immediately produce upon the quantity both of national indu&s;try, and of the annual produce of land and labour.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of the Divi&s;ion of Stock.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN the &s;tock which a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es is no more than &s;ufficient to maintain him for a few days or a few weeks, he &s;eldom thinks of deriving any revenue from it. He con&s;umes it as &s;paringly as he can, and endeavours by his labour to acquire &s;omething which may &s;upply its place before it be con&s;umed alto|gether. His revenue is, in this ca&s;e, derived from his labour only. This is the &s;tate of the greater part of the labouring poor in all countries.</P>
<P>BUT when he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;tock &s;ufficient to maintain him for months or years, he naturally endeavours to derive a revenue from the greater part of it; re&s;erving only &s;o much for his immediate con&s;umption as may maintain him till this revenue begins to come in. His whole &s;tock, therefore, is di&s;tingui&s;hed into two parts. That part which, he expects, is to afford him this revenue is called his capital. The other is that which &s;upplied his immediate con|&s;umption; and which con&s;i&s;ts either, fir&s;t, in that portion of his whole &s;tock which was originally re&s;erved for this purpo&s;e; or, &s;econdly, in his revenue, from whatever &s;ource derived, as it gra|dually comes in; or, thirdly, in &s;uch things as had been purcha&s;ed by either of the&s;e in former years, and which are not yet entirely con&s;umed; &s;uch as a &s;tock of cloaths, hou&s;hold furniture, and the like. In one, or other, or all of the&s;e three articles, con&s;i&s;ts the &s;tock which men commonly re&s;erve for their own immediate con|&s;umption.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="343">
THERE are two different ways in which a capital may be em|ployed &s;o as to yield a revenue or profit to its employer.</P>
<P>FIRST, it may be employed in rai&s;ing, manufacturing, or pur|cha&s;ing goods, and &s;elling them again with a profit. The capital employed in this manner yields no revenue or profit to its employer, while it either remains in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or continues in the &s;ame &s;hape. The goods of the merchant yield him no revenue or profit till he &s;ells them for money, and the money yields him as little till it is again exchanged for goods. His capital is continually going from him in one &s;hape, and returning to him in another, and it is only by means of &s;uch circulation or &s;ucce&s;&s;ive exchanges that it can yield him any profit. Such capitals, therefore, may very properly be called circulating capitals.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, it may be employed in the improvement of land, in the purcha&s;e of u&s;eful machines and in&s;truments of trade, or in &s;uch-like things as yield a revenue or profit without changing ma&s;ters or circulating any further. Such capitals, therefore, may very properly be called fixed capitals.</P>
<P>DIFFERENT occupations require very different proportions be|tween the fixed and circulating capitals employed in them.</P>
<P>THE capital of a merchant, for example, is altogether a circu|lating capital. He has occa&s;ion for no machines or in&s;truments of trade, unle&s;s his &s;hop or warehou&s;e be con&s;idered as &s;uch.</P>
<P>SOME part of the capital of every ma&s;ter artificer or manufac|turer mu&s;t be fixed in the in&s;truments of his trade. This part, however, is very &s;mall in &s;ome, and very great in others. A ma&s;ter
<PB N="332" REF="344">
taylor requires no other in&s;truments of trade but a parcel of needles. Tho&s;e of the ma&s;ter &s;hoemaker are a little, though but a very little, more expen&s;ive. Tho&s;e of the weaver ri&s;e a good deal above tho&s;e of the &s;hoemaker. The far greater part of the capital of all &s;uch ma&s;ter artificers, however, is circulated either in the wages of their workmen, or in the price of their materials, and repaid with a profit by the price of the work.</P>
<P>IN other works a much greater fixed capital is required. In a great iron-work, for example, the furnace for melting the ore, the forge, the &s;litt-mill, are in&s;truments of trade which cannot be erected without a very great expence. In coal-works and mines of every kind, the machinery nece&s;&s;ary both for drawing out the water and for other purpo&s;es, is frequently &s;till more expen&s;ive.</P>
<P>THAT part of the capital of the farmer which is employed in the in&s;truments of agriculture is a fixed; that which is employed in the wages and maintenance of his labouring &s;ervants, is a circu|lating capital. He makes a profit of the one by keeping it in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and of the other by parting with it. The price or value of his labouring cattle is a fixed capital in the &s;ame manner as that of the in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry: Their maintenance is a circulating capital in the &s;ame manner as that of the labouring &s;ervants. The farmer makes his profit by keeping the labouring cattle, and by parting with their maintenance. Both the price and the maintenance of the cattle which are bought in and fattened, not for labour, but for &s;ale, are a circulating capital. The farmer makes his profit by parting with them. A flock of &s;heep or a herd of cattle that, in a breeding country, is bought in, neither for labour nor for &s;ale, but in order to make a profit by their wool, by their milk, and by their increa&s;e, is a fixed capital. The profit is made by keeping them. Their maintenance is a circulating
<PB N="333" REF="345">
capital. The profit is made by parting with it; and it comes back with both its own profit, and the profit upon the whole price of the cattle, in the price of the wool, the milk, and the increa&s;e. The whole value of the &s;eed too is properly a fixed capital. Tho' it goes backwards and forwards between the ground and the granary, it never changes ma&s;ters, and therefore does not properly circulate. The farmer makes his profit, not by its &s;ale, but by its increa&s;e.</P>
<P>THE general &s;tock of any country or &s;ociety is the &s;ame with that of all its inhabitants or members, and therefore naturally divides it&s;elf into the &s;ame three portions, each of which has a di&s;|tinct function or office.</P>
<P>THE Fir&s;t, is that portion which is re&s;erved for immediate con|&s;umption, and of which the characteri&s;tick is, that it affords no revenue or profit. It con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;tock of food, cloaths, hou&s;|hold furniture, &amp;c. which have been purcha&s;ed by their proper con&s;umers, but which are not yet entirely con&s;umed. The whole &s;tock of mere dwelling hou&s;es too &s;ub&s;i&s;ting at any one time in the country, make a part of this fir&s;t portion. The &s;tock that is laid out in a hou&s;e, if it is to be the dwelling hou&s;e of the proprietor, cea&s;es from that moment to &s;erve in the function of a capital, or to afford any revenue to its owner. A dwelling hou&s;e, as &s;uch, con|tributes nothing to the revenue of its inhabitant; and though it is, no doubt, extremely u&s;eful to him, it is as his cloaths and hou&s;hold furniture are u&s;eful to him, which, however, make a part of his expence, and not of his revenue. If it is to be lett to a tenant for rent, as the hou&s;e it&s;elf can produce nothing, the tenant mu&s;t always pay the rent out of &s;ome other revenue which he derives either from labour, or &s;tock, or land. Though a hou&s;e, therefore, may yield a revenue to its proprietor, and thereby &s;erve in the function of a capital to him, it cannot yield any to the
<PB N="334" REF="346">
publick, nor &s;erve in the function of a capital to it, and the revenue of the whole body of the people can never be in the &s;malle&s;t degree increa&s;ed by it. Cloaths, and hou&s;hold furniture, in the &s;ame manner, &s;ometimes yield a revenue, and thereby &s;erve in the func|tion of a capital to particular per&s;ons. In countries where ma&s;|querades are common, it is a trade to lett out ma&s;querade dre&s;&s;es for a night. Uphol&s;terers frequently lett furniture by the month or by the year. Undertakers lett the furniture of funerals by the day and by the week. Many people lett furni&s;hed hou&s;es, and get a rent, not only for the u&s;e of the hou&s;e, but for that of the fur|niture. The revenue, however, which is derived from &s;uch things, mu&s;t always be ultimately drawn from &s;ome other &s;ource of reve|nue. Of all parts of the &s;tock, either of an individual, or of a &s;ociety, re&s;erved for immediate con&s;umption, what is laid out in hou&s;es is mo&s;t &s;lowly con&s;umed. A &s;tock of cloaths may la&s;t &s;everal years: a &s;tock of furniture half a century or a century: but a &s;tock of hou&s;es, well built and properly taken care of, may la&s;t many centuries. Though the period of their total con&s;ump|tion, however, is more di&s;tant, they are &s;till as really a &s;tock re|&s;erved for immediate con&s;umption as either cloaths, or hou&s;hold furniture.</P>
<P>THE Second of the three portions into which the general &s;tock of the &s;ociety divides it&s;elf, is the fixed capital; of which the cha|racteri&s;tick is, that it affords a revenue or profit without circulating or changing ma&s;ters. It con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of the four following articles:</P>
<P>FIRST, of all u&s;eful machines and in&s;truments of trade which facilitate and abridge labour:</P>
<P>SECONDLY, of all tho&s;e profitable buildings which are the means of procuring a revenue, not only to their proprietor who
<PB N="335" REF="347">
letts them for a rent, but to the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them and pays that rent for them; &s;uch as &s;hops, warehou&s;es, workhou&s;es, farmhou&s;es, with all their nece&s;&s;ary buildings, &s;tables, granaries, &amp;c. The&s;e are very different from mere dwelling hou&s;es. They are a &s;ort of in&s;truments of trade, and may be con&s;idered in the &s;ame light:</P>
<P>THIRDLY, of the improvements of land, of what has been profitably laid out in clearing, draining, enclo&s;ing, manuring, and reducing it into the condition mo&s;t proper for tillage and culture. An improved farm may very ju&s;tly be regarded in the &s;ame light as tho&s;e u&s;eful machines which facilitate and abridge labour, and by means of which, an equal circulating capital can afford a much greater revenue to its employer. An improved farm is equally advantageous and more durable than any of tho&s;e machines, fre|quently requiring no other repairs than the mo&s;t profitable applica|tion of the farmer's capital employed in cultivating it:</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, of the acquired and u&s;eful abilities of all the inha|bitants or members of the &s;ociety. The acqui&s;ition of &s;uch talents, by the maintenance of the acquirer during his education, &s;tudy, or apprentice&s;hip, always co&s;ts a real expence, which is a capital fixed and realized, as it were, in his per&s;on. Tho&s;e talents, as they make a part of his fortune, &s;o do they likewi&s;e of that of the &s;ociety to which he belongs. The improved dexterity of a work|man may be con&s;idered in the &s;ame light as a machine or in&s;tru|ment of trade which facilitates and abridges labour, and which, though it co&s;ts a certain expence, repays that expence with a profit.</P>
<P>THE Third and la&s;t of the three portions into which the general &s;tock of the &s;ociety naturally divides it&s;elf, is the circulating capital;
<PB N="336" REF="348">
of which the characteri&s;tick is, that it affords a revenue only by circulating or changing ma&s;ters. It is compo&s;ed likewi&s;e of four parts:</P>
<P>FIRST, of the money by means of which all the other three are circulated and di&s;tributed to their proper u&s;ers and con&s;umers:</P>
<P>SECONDLY, of the &s;tock of provi&s;ions which are in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the butcher, the grazier, the farmer, the corn-merchant, the brewer, &amp;c. and from the &s;ale of which they expect to derive a profit:</P>
<P>THIRDLY, of the materials, whether altogether rude, or more or le&s;s manufactured, of cloaths, furniture, and building, which are not yet made up into any of tho&s;e three &s;hapes, but which remain in the hands of the growers, the manufacturers, the mercers and drapers, the timber-merchants, the carpenters and joiners, the brickmakers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, and la&s;tly, of the work which is made up and compleated, but which is &s;till in the hands of the merchant or manufacturer, and not yet di&s;po&s;ed of or di&s;tributed to the proper u&s;ers and con&s;umers; &s;uch as the fini&s;hed work which we fre|quently find ready made in the &s;hops of the &s;mith, the cabinet-maker, the gold&s;mith, the jeweller, the china-merchant, &amp;c. The circulating capital con&s;i&s;ts, in this manner, of the provi&s;ions, ma|terials, and fini&s;hed work of all kinds that are in the hands of their re&s;pective dealers, and of the money that is nece&s;&s;ary for circulating and di&s;tributing them to tho&s;e who are finally to u&s;e or to con&s;ume them.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="349">
OF the&s;e four parts three, provi&s;ions, materials, and fini&s;hed work, are, either annually, or in a longer or &s;horter period, regu|larly withdrawn from it, and placed either in the fixed capital or in the &s;tock re&s;erved for immediate con&s;umption.</P>
<P>EVERY fixed capital is both originally derived from, and requires to be continually &s;upported by a circulating capital. All u&s;eful machines and in&s;truments of trade are originally derived from a circulating capital, which furni&s;hes the materials of which they are made, and the maintenance of the workmen who make them. They require too a capital of the &s;ame kind to keep them in con|&s;tant repair.</P>
<P>NO fixed capital can yield any revenue but by means of a circu|lating capital. The mo&s;t u&s;eful machines and in&s;truments of trade will produce nothing without the circulating capital which affords the materials they are employed upon, and the maintenance of the workmen who employ them. Land, however improved, will yield no revenue without a circulating capital, which maintains the labourers who cultivate and collect its produce.</P>
<P>TO maintain and augment the &s;tock which may be re&s;erved for immediate con&s;umption, is the &s;ole end and purpo&s;e both of the fixed and circulating capitals. It is this &s;tock which feeds, cloaths, and lodges the people. Their riches or poverty depends upon the abundant or &s;paring &s;upplies which tho&s;e two capitals can afford to the &s;tock re&s;erved for immediate con&s;umption.</P>
<P>SO great a part of the circulating capital being continually with|drawn from it in order to be placed in the other two branches of the general &s;tock of the &s;ociety, it mu&s;t in its turn require continual
<PB N="338" REF="350">
&s;upplies, without which it would &s;oon cea&s;e to exi&s;t. The&s;e &s;up|plies are principally drawn from three &s;ources, the produce of land, of mines, and of fi&s;heries. The&s;e afford continual &s;upplies of pro|vi&s;ions and materials, of which part is afterwards wrought up into fini&s;hed work, and by which are replaced the provi&s;ions, mate|rials, and fini&s;hed work continually withdrawn from the circulating capital. From mines too is drawn what is nece&s;&s;ary for maintain|ing and augmenting that part of it which con&s;i&s;ts in money. For though, in the ordinary cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, this part is not, like the other three, nece&s;&s;arily withdrawn from it, in order to be placed in the other two branches of the general &s;tock of the &s;ociety, it mu&s;t, however, like all other things, be wa&s;ted and worn out at la&s;t, and &s;ometimes too be either lo&s;t or &s;ent abroad, and mu&s;t, therefore, require continual, though, no doubt, much &s;maller &s;upplies.</P>
<P>LAND, mines, and fi&s;heries, require all both a fixed and a cir|culating capital to cultivate them; and their produce replaces with a profit, not only tho&s;e capitals, but all the others in the &s;ociety. Thus the farmer annually replaces to the manufacturer the provi|&s;ions which he had con&s;umed and the materials which he had wrought up the year before; and the manufacturer replaces to the farmer the fini&s;hed work which he had wa&s;ted and worn out in the &s;ame time. This is the real exchange that is annually made between tho&s;e two orders of people, though it &s;eldom happens that the rude produce of the one and the manufactured produce of the other, are directly bartered for one another; becau&s;e it &s;eldom happens that the farmer &s;ells his corn and his cattle, his flax and his wool, to the very &s;ame per&s;on of whom he chu&s;es to purcha&s;e the cloaths, furniture, and in&s;truments of trade which he wants. He &s;ells, therefore, his rude produce for money, with which he can purcha&s;e, wherever it is to be had, the manufactured produce he has occa&s;ion
<PB N="339" REF="351">
for. Land even replaces, in part at lea&s;t, the capitals with which fi&s;heries and mines are cultivated. It is the produce of land which draws the fi&s;h from the waters; and it is the produce of the &s;urface of the earth which extracts the minerals from its bowels.</P>
<P>THE produce of land, mines, and fi&s;heries, when their natural fertility is equal, is in proportion to the extent and proper appli|cation of the capitals employed about them. When the capitals are equal and equally well applied, it is in proportion to their natural fertility.</P>
<P>IN all countries where there is tolerable &s;ecurity, every man of common under&s;tanding will endeavour to employ whatever &s;tock he can command in procuring either pre&s;ent enjoyment or future profit. If it is employed in procuring pre&s;ent enjoyment, it is a &s;tock re&s;erved for immediate con&s;umption. If it is employed in procuring future profit, it mu&s;t procure this profit either by &s;taying with him, or by going from him. In the one ca&s;e it is a fixed, in the other it is a circulating capital. A man mu&s;t be perfectly crazy who, where there is tolerable &s;ecurity, does not employ all the &s;tock which he com|mands, whether it be his own or borrowed of other people, in &s;ome one or other of tho&s;e three ways.</P>
<P>IN tho&s;e unfortunate countries, indeed, where men are continually afraid of the violence of their &s;uperiors, they frequently bury and conceal a great part of their &s;tock, in order to have it always at hand to carry with them to &s;ome place of &s;afety in ca&s;e of their being threatened with any of tho&s;e di&s;a&s;ters to which they con&s;ider them|&s;elves as at all times expo&s;ed. This is &s;aid to be a common practice in Turky, in Indo&s;tan, and, I believe, in mo&s;t other governments
<PB N="340" REF="352">
of A&s;ia. It &s;eems to have been a common practice among our ance&s;|tors during the violence of the feudal government. Trea&s;ure-trove was in tho&s;e times con&s;idered as no contemptible part of the revenue of the greate&s;t &s;overeigns in Europe. It con&s;i&s;ted in &s;uch trea&s;ure as was found concealed in the earth, and to which no particular per&s;on could prove any right. This was regarded in tho&s;e times as &s;o im|portant an object, that it was always con&s;idered as belonging to the &s;overeign, and neither to the finder nor to the proprietor of the land, unle&s;s the right to it had been conveyed to the latter by an expre&s;s clau&s;e in his charter. It was put upon the &s;ame footing with gold and &s;ilver mines, which, without a &s;pecial clau&s;e in the charter, were never &s;uppo&s;ed to be comprehended in the general grant of the lands, though mines of lead, copper, tin, and coal were, as things of &s;maller con&s;equence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of Money con&s;idered as a particular Branch of the general Stock of the Society, or of the Expence of maintaining the National Capital.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT has been &s;hewn in the fir&s;t book, that the price of the greater part of commodities re&s;olves it&s;elf into three parts, of which one pays the wages of the labour, another the profits of the &s;tock, and a third the rent of the land which had been employed in pro|ducing and bringing them to market: that there are, indeed, &s;ome commodities of which the price is made up of two of tho&s;e parts only, the wages of labour, and the profits of &s;tock: and a very few in which it con&s;i&s;ts altogether in one, the wages of labour: but that the price of every commodity nece&s;&s;arily re&s;olves it&s;elf into &s;ome one or other or all of the&s;e three parts; every part of it which goes neither to rent nor to wages, being nece&s;&s;arily profit to &s;ome|body.</P>
<P>SINCE this is the ca&s;e, it has been ob&s;erved, with regard to every particular commodity, taken &s;eparately; it mu&s;t be &s;o with re|gard to all the commodities which compo&s;e the whole annual produce of the land and labour of every country, taken complexly. The whole price or exchangeable value of that annual produce, mu&s;t re&s;olve it&s;elf into the &s;ame three parts, and be parcelled out among the different inhabitants of the country, either as the wages of their labour, the profits of their &s;tock, or the rent of their land.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="354">
BUT though the whole value of the annual produce of the land and labour of every country, is thus divided among and con&s;titutes a revenue to its different inhabitants, yet as in the rent of a pri|vate e&s;tate we di&s;tingui&s;h between the gro&s;s rent and the neat rent, &s;o may we likewi&s;e in the revenue of all the inhabitants of a great country.</P>
<P>THE gro&s;s rent of a private e&s;tate comprehends whatever is paid by the farmer: the neat rent, what remains free to the landlord, after deducting the expence of management, of repairs, and all other nece&s;&s;ary charges; or what, without hurting his e&s;tate, he can afford to place in his &s;tock re&s;erved for immediate con&s;umption, or to &s;pend upon his table, equipage, the ornaments of his hou&s;e and furniture, his private enjoyments and amu&s;ements. His real wealth is in proportion, not to his gro&s;s, but to his neat rent.</P>
<P>THE gro&s;s revenue of all the inhabitants of a great country, comprehends the whole annual produce of their land and labour: the neat revenue, what remains free to them after deducting the expence of maintaining; fir&s;t, their fixed; and, &s;econdly, their circulating capital; or what, without encroaching upon their ca|pital, they can place in their &s;tock re&s;erved for immediate con|&s;umption, or &s;pend upon their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, conveniencies and amu&s;ements. Their real wealth too is in proportion, not to their gro&s;s, but to their neat revenue.</P>
<P>THE whole expence of maintaining the fixed capital, mu&s;t evi|dently be excluded from the neat revenue of the &s;ociety. Neither the materials nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting their u&s;eful machines and in&s;truments of trade, their profitable buildings, &amp;c. nor the pro|duce of the labour nece&s;&s;ary for fa&s;hioning tho&s;e materials into the proper form, can ever make any part of it. The price of that labour may, indeed, make a part of it; as the workmen &s;o
<PB N="343" REF="355">
employed may place the whole value of their wages in their &s;tock re&s;erved for immediate con&s;umption. But in other &s;orts of labour, both the price and the produce go to this &s;tock, the price to that of the workmen, the produce to that of other people, who&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, conveniencies, and amu&s;ements, are augmented by the labour of tho&s;e workmen.</P>
<P>THE intention of the fixed capital is to increa&s;e the productive powers of labour, or to enable the &s;ame number of labourers to perform a much greater quantity of work. In a farm where all the nece&s;&s;ary buildings, fences, drains, communications, &amp;c. are in the mo&s;t perfect good order, the &s;ame number of labourers and labouring cattle will rai&s;e a much greater produce, than in one of equal extent and equally good ground, but not furni&s;hed with equal conveniencies. In manufactures the &s;ame number of hands a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the be&s;t machinery, will work up a much greater quantity of goods than with more imperfect in&s;truments of trade. The expence which is properly laid out upon a fixed capital of any kind, is always repaid with great profit, and increa&s;es the an|nual produce by a much greater value than that of the &s;upport which &s;uch improvements require. This &s;upport, however, &s;till requires a certain portion of that produce. A certain quantity of materials, and the labour of a certain number of workmen, both of which might have been immediately employed to augment the food, cloathing, and lodging, the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and conveniencies of the &s;ociety, are thus diverted to another employment, highly ad|vantageous indeed, but &s;till different from this one. It is upon this account that all &s;uch improvements in mechanicks, as enable the &s;ame number of workmen to perform an equal quantity of work, with cheaper and &s;impler machinery than had been u&s;ual before, are always regarded as advantageous to every &s;ociety. A certain quantity of materials, and the labour of a certain number
<PB N="344" REF="356">
of workmen, which had before been employed in &s;upporting a more complex and expen&s;ive machinery, can afterwards be ap|plied to augment the quantity of work which that or any other machinery is u&s;eful only for performing. The undertaker of &s;ome great manufactory who employs a thou&s;and a-year in the main|tenance of his machinery, if he can reduce this expence to five hundred, will naturally employ the other five hundred in pur|cha&s;ing an additional quantity of materials to be wrought up by an additional number of workmen. The quantity of that work, therefore, which his machinery was u&s;eful only for performing, will naturally be augmented, and with it all the advantage and conveniency which the &s;ociety can derive from that work.</P>
<P>THE expence of maintaining the fixed capital in a great country, may very properly be compared to that of repairs in a private e&s;tate. The expence of repairs may frequently be nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting the produce of the e&s;tate, and con&s;equently both the gro&s;s and the neat rent of the landlord. When by a more proper direction, however, it can be dimini&s;hed without occa&s;ioning any diminution of produce, the gro&s;s rent remains at lea&s;t the &s;ame as before, and the neat rent is nece&s;&s;arily augmented.</P>
<P>BUT though the whole expence of maintaining the fixed capital is thus nece&s;&s;arily excluded from the neat revenue of the &s;ociety, it is not the &s;ame ca&s;e with that of maintaining the circulating ca|pital. Of the four parts of which this latter capital is compo&s;ed, money, provi&s;ions, materials, and fini&s;hed work, the three la&s;t, it has already been ob&s;erved, are regularly withdrawn from it, and placed either in the fixed capital of the &s;ociety, or in their &s;tock re&s;erved for immediate con&s;umption. Whatever portion of tho&s;e con&s;umable goods is not employed in maintaining the former, goes all to the latter, and makes a part of the neat revenue of the
<PB N="345" REF="357">
&s;ociety. The maintenance of tho&s;e three parts of the circulating capital, therefore, withdraws no portion of the annual produce from the neat revenue of the &s;ociety, be&s;ides what is nece&s;&s;ary for maintaining the fixed capital.</P>
<P>THE circulating capital of a &s;ociety is in this re&s;pect different from that of an individual. That of an individual is totally ex|cluded from making any part of his neat revenue, which mu&s;t con|&s;i&s;t altogether in his profits. But though the circulating capital of every individual, makes a part of that of the &s;ociety to which he belongs, it is not upon that account totally excluded from making a part likewi&s;e of their neat revenue. Though the whole goods in a merchant's &s;hop mu&s;t by no means be placed in his own &s;tock re&s;erved for immediate con&s;umption, they may in that of other people, who from a revenue derived from other funds, may regularly replace their value to him together with its profits, without occa&s;ioning any diminution either of his capital or of their's.</P>
<P>MONEY, therefore, is the only part of the circulating capital of a &s;ociety of which the maintenance can occa&s;ion any diminution in their neat revenue.</P>
<P>THE fixed capital, and that part of the circulating capital which con&s;i&s;ts in money, &s;o far as they affect the revenue of the &s;ociety, bear a very great re&s;emblance to one another.</P>
<P>FIRST, as tho&s;e machines and in&s;truments of trade, &amp;c. re|quire a certain expence fir&s;t to erect them and afterwards to &s;upport them, both which expences, though they make a part of the gro&s;s, are deductions from the neat revenue of the &s;ociety; &s;o the &s;tock of money which circulates in any country mu&s;t require a certain
<PB N="346" REF="358">
expence, fir&s;t to collect it, and afterwards to &s;upport it, both which expences, though they make a part of the gro&s;s, are, in the &s;ame manner, deductions from the neat revenue of the &s;ociety. A cer|tain quantity of very valuable materials, gold and &s;ilver, and of very curious labour, in&s;tead of augmenting the &s;tock re&s;erved for immediate con&s;umption, the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, conveniencies, and amu&s;e|ments of individuals, is employed in &s;upporting that great but expen&s;ive in&s;trument of commerce, by means of which every indi|vidual in the &s;ociety has his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, conveniencies, and amu&s;e|ments, regularly di&s;tributed to him in their proper proportions.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, as the machines and in&s;truments of trade, &amp;c. which compo&s;e the fixed capital either of an individual or of a &s;ociety, make no part either of the gro&s;s or of the neat revenue of either; &s;o money, by means of which the whole revenue of the &s;ociety is regularly di&s;tributed among all its different members, makes it&s;elf no part of that revenue. The great wheel of circulation is alto|gether different from the goods which are circulated by means of it. The revenue of the &s;ociety con&s;i&s;ts altogether in tho&s;e goods, and not in the wheel which circulates them. In computing either the gro&s;s or the neat revenue of any &s;ociety, we mu&s;t always, from their whole annual circulation of money and goods, deduct the whole value of the money, of which not a &s;ingle farthing can ever make any part of either.</P>
<P>IT is the ambiguity of language only which can make this pro|po&s;ition appear either doubtful or paradoxical. When properly explained and under&s;tood, it is almo&s;t &s;elf-evident.</P>
<P>WHEN we talk of any particular &s;um of money, we &s;ometimes mean nothing but the metal pieces of which it is compo&s;ed; and &s;ometimes we include in our meaning &s;ome ob&s;cure reference to
<PB N="347" REF="359">
the goods which can be had in exchange for it, or to the power of purcha&s;ing which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it conveys. Thus when we &s;ay, that the circulating money of England has been computed at eighteen millions, we mean only to expre&s;s the amount of the metal pieces, which &s;ome writers have computed or rather have &s;uppo&s;ed to circulate in that country. But when we &s;ay that a man is worth fifty or a hundred pounds a-year, we mean com|monly to expre&s;s not only the amount of the metal pieces which are annually paid to him, but the value of the goods which he can annually purcha&s;e or con&s;ume. We mean commonly to a&s;certain what is or ought to be his way of living, or the quantity and quality of the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life in which he can with propriety indulge him&s;elf.</P>
<P>WHEN, by any particular &s;um of money, we mean not only to expre&s;s the amount of the metal pieces of which it is compo&s;ed, but to include in its &s;ignification &s;ome ob&s;cure reference to the goods which can be had in exchange for them, the wealth or re|venue which it in this ca&s;e denotes, is equal only to one of the two values which are thus intimated &s;omewhat ambiguou&s;ly by the &s;ame word, and to the latter more properly than to the former, to the money's-worth more properly than to the money.</P>
<P>THUS if a guinea be the weekly pen&s;ion of a particular per&s;on, he can in the cour&s;e of the week purcha&s;e with it a certain quantity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, conveniencies, and amu&s;ements. In proportion as this quantity is great or &s;mall, &s;o are his real riches, his real weekly revenue. His weekly revenue is certainly not equal both to the guinea, and to what can be purcha&s;ed with it, but only to one or other of tho&s;e two equal values; and to the latter more pro|perly than to the former, to the guinea's-worth rather than to the guinea.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="360">
IF the pen&s;ion of &s;uch a per&s;on was paid to him, not in gold, but in a weekly bill for a guinea, his revenue &s;urely would not &s;o properly con&s;i&s;t in the piece of paper, as in what he could get for it. A guinea may be con&s;idered as a bill for a certain quantity of nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies upon all the trade&s;men in the neighbourhood. The revenue of the per&s;on to whom it is paid, does not &s;o properly con&s;i&s;t in the piece of gold, as in what he can get for it, or in what he can exchange it for. If it could be ex|changed for nothing, it would, like a bill upon a bankrupt, be of no more value than the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s piece of paper.</P>
<P>THOUGH the weekly, or yearly revenue of all the different in|habitants of any country, in the &s;ame manner, may be, and in reality frequently is paid to them in money, their real riches, how|ever, the real weekly or yearly revenue of all of them taken to|gether, mu&s;t always be great or &s;mall in proportion to the quan|tity of con&s;umable goods which they can all of them purcha&s;e with this money. The whole revenue of all of them taken together is evidently not equal to both the money and the con&s;umable goods; but only to one or other of tho&s;e two values, and to the latter more properly than to the former.</P>
<P>THOUGH we frequently, therefore, expre&s;s a per&s;on's revenue by the metal pieces which are annually paid to him, it is becau&s;e the amount of tho&s;e pieces regulates the extent of his power of purcha&s;ing, or the value of the goods which he can annually af|ford to con&s;ume. We &s;till con&s;ider his revenue as con&s;i&s;ting in this power of purcha&s;ing or con&s;uming, and not in the pieces which convey it.</P>
<P>BUT if this is &s;ufficiently evident even with regard to an indivi|dual, it is &s;till more &s;o with regard to a &s;ociety. The amount of
<PB N="349" REF="361">
the metal pieces which are annually paid to an individual, is often preci&s;ely equal to his revenue, and is upon that account the &s;horte&s;t and be&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of its value. But the amount of the metal pieces which circulate in a &s;ociety, can never be equal to the re|venue of all its members. As the &s;ame guinea which pays the weekly pen&s;ion of one man to-day, may pay that of another to|morrow, and that of a third the day thereafter, the amount of the metal pieces which annually circulate in any country, mu&s;t always be of much le&s;s value than the whole money pen&s;ions annually paid with them. But the power of purcha&s;ing, the goods which can &s;ucce&s;&s;ively be bought with the whole of tho&s;e money pen&s;ions as they are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively paid, mu&s;t always be preci&s;ely of the &s;ame value with tho&s;e pen&s;ions; as mu&s;t likewi&s;e be the revenue of the different per&s;ons to whom they are paid. That revenue, there|fore, cannot con&s;i&s;t in tho&s;e metal pieces, of which the amount is &s;o much inferior to its value, but in the power of purcha&s;ing, in the goods which can &s;ucce&s;&s;ively be bought with them as they cir|culate from hand to hand.</P>
<P>MONEY, therefore, the great wheel of circulation, the great in&s;trument of commerce, like all other in&s;truments of trade, though it makes a part and a very valuable part of the capital, makes no part of the revenue of the &s;ociety to which it belongs; and though the metal pieces of which it is compo&s;ed, in the cour&s;e of their annual circulation, di&s;tribute to every man the revenue which properly belongs to him, they make them&s;elves no part of that revenue.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, and la&s;tly, the machines and in&s;truments of trade, &amp;c. which compo&s;e the fixed capital, bear this further re&s;emblance to that part of the circulating capital which con&s;i&s;ts in money; that as every &s;aving in the expence of erecting and &s;upporting tho&s;e
<PB N="350" REF="362">
machines, which does not dimini&s;h the productive powers of labour, is an improvement of the neat revenue of the &s;ociety; &s;o every &s;aving in the expence of collecting and &s;upporting that part of the cir|culating capital which con&s;i&s;ts in money, is an improvement of exactly the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ufficiently obvious, and it has partly too been explained already, in what manner every &s;aving in the expence of &s;upporting the fixed capital is an improvement of the neat revenue of the &s;ociety. The whole capital of the undertaker of every work is nece&s;|&s;arily divided between his fixed and his circulating capital. While his whole capital remains the &s;ame, the &s;maller the one part, the greater mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the other. It is the circulating capital which furni&s;hes the materials and wages of labour, and puts indu&s;try into motion. Every &s;aving, therefore, in the expence of maintaining the fixed capital, which does not dimini&s;h the productive powers of labour, mu&s;t increa&s;e the fund which puts indu&s;try into motion, and con&s;equently the annual produce of land and labour, the real revenue of every &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;titution of paper in the room of gold and &s;ilver money, replaces a very expen&s;ive in&s;trument of commerce with one much le&s;s co&s;tly, and &s;ometimes equally convenient. Circulation comes to be carried on by a new wheel, which it co&s;ts le&s;s both to erect and to maintain than the old one. But in what manner this opera|tion is performed, and in what manner it tends to increa&s;e either the gro&s;s or the neat revenue of the &s;ociety, is not altogether &s;o obvious, and may therefore require &s;ome further explication.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal different &s;orts of paper money; but the circu|lating notes of banks and bankers are the &s;pecies which is be&s;t known, and which &s;eems be&s;t adapted for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="363">
WHEN the people of any particular country have &s;uch con|fidence in the fortune, probity, and prudence of a particular banker, as to believe that he is always ready to pay upon demand &s;uch of his promi&s;&s;ary notes as are likely to be at any time pre&s;ented to him; tho&s;e notes come to have the &s;ame currency as gold and &s;ilver money, from the confidence that &s;uch money can at any time be had for them.</P>
<P>A PARTICULAR banker lends among his cu&s;tomers his own promi&s;&s;ary notes, to the extent, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, of a hundred thou&s;and pounds. As tho&s;e notes &s;erve all the purpo&s;es of money, his debtors pay him the &s;ame intere&s;t as if he had lent them &s;o much money. This intere&s;t is the &s;ource of his gain. Though &s;ome of tho&s;e notes are continually coming back upon him for payment, part of them continue to circulate for months and years together. Though he has generally in circulation, therefore, notes to the extent of a hundred thou&s;and pounds, twenty thou&s;and pounds in gold and &s;ilver may, frequently, be a &s;ufficient provi&s;ion for an|&s;wering occa&s;ional demands. By this operation, therefore, twenty thou&s;and pounds in gold and &s;ilver perform all the functions which a hundred thou&s;and could otherwi&s;e have performed. The &s;ame exchanges may be made, the &s;ame quantity of con&s;umable goods may be circulated and di&s;tributed to their proper con&s;umers, by means of his promi&s;&s;ary notes, to the value of a hundred thou|&s;and pounds, as by an equal value of gold and &s;ilver money. Eighty thou&s;and pounds of gold and &s;ilver, therefore, can, in this manner, be &s;pared from the circulation of the country; and if different operations of the &s;ame kind, &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, be carried on by many different banks and bankers, the whole circulation may thus be conducted with a fifth part only of the gold and &s;ilver which would otherwi&s;e have been requi&s;ite.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="364">
LET us &s;uppo&s;e, for example, that the whole circulating money of &s;ome particular country amounted, at a particular time, to one million &s;terling, that &s;um being then &s;ufficient for circulating the whole annual produce of their land and labour. Let us &s;uppo&s;e too, that &s;ome time thereafter, different banks and bankers i&s;&s;ued promi&s;&s;ary notes, payable to the bearer, to the extent of one million, re&s;erving in their different coffers two hundred thou&s;and pounds for an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands. There would remain, therefore, in circulation, eight hundred thou&s;and pounds in gold and &s;ilver, and a million of bank notes, or, eighteen hundred thou&s;and pounds of paper and money together. But the annual produce of the land and labour of the country had before required only one million to circulate and di&s;tribute it to its proper con&s;umers, and that annual produce cannot be immediately aug|mented by tho&s;e operations of banking. One million, therefore, will be &s;ufficient to circulate it after them. The goods to be bought and &s;old being preci&s;ely the &s;ame as before, the &s;ame quantity of money will be &s;ufficient for buying and &s;elling them. The channel of circulation, if I may be allowed &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion, will remain preci&s;ely the &s;ame as before. One million we have &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ufficient to fill that channel. Whatever, therefore, is poured into it beyond this &s;um, cannot run in it, but mu&s;t overflow. One million eight hundred thou&s;and pounds are poured into it. Eight hundred thou&s;and pounds, therefore, mu&s;t overflow, that &s;um being over and above what can be employed in the circulation of the country. But though this &s;um cannot be employed at home, it is too valuable to be allowed to lie idle. It will, therefore, be &s;ent abroad, in order to &s;eek that profitable employment which it cannot find at home. But the paper cannot go abroad; becau&s;e at a di&s;tance from the banks which i&s;&s;ue it, and from the country in which payment of it can be exacted by law, it will not be received in common payments. Gold and &s;ilver, therefore, to the
<PB N="353" REF="365">
amount of eight hundred thou&s;and pounds will be &s;ent abroad, and the channel of home circulation will remain filled with a million of paper, in&s;tead of the million of tho&s;e metals which filled it before.</P>
<P>BUT though &s;o great a quantity of gold and &s;ilver is thus &s;ent abroad, we mu&s;t not imagine that it is &s;ent abroad for nothing, or that its proprietors make a pre&s;ent of it to foreign nations. They will exchange it for foreign goods of &s;ome kind or another, in order to &s;upply the con&s;umption either of &s;ome other foreign country or of their own.</P>
<P>IF they employ it in purcha&s;ing goods in one foreign country in order to &s;upply the con&s;umption of another, or in what is called the carrying trade, whatever profit they make will be an addition to the neat revenue of their own country. It is like a new fund, created for carrying on a new trade; dome&s;tick bu&s;ine&s;s being now tran&s;|acted by paper, and the gold and &s;ilver being converted into a fund for this new trade.</P>
<P>IF they employ it in purcha&s;ing foreign goods for home con|&s;umption, they may either, fir&s;t, purcha&s;e &s;uch goods as are likely to be con&s;umed by idle people who produce nothing, &s;uch as foreign wines, foreign &s;ilks, &amp;c.; or, &s;econdly, they may purcha&s;e an additional &s;tock of materials, tools, and provi&s;ions, in order to maintain and employ an additional number of indu&s;trious people, who re-produce, with a profit, the value of their annual con|&s;umption.</P>
<P>SO far as it is employed in the fir&s;t way, it promotes prodigality, increa&s;es expence and con&s;umption without increa&s;ing production, or e&s;tabli&s;hing any permanent fund for &s;upporting that expence, and is in every re&s;pect hurtful to the &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="366">
SO far as it is employed in the &s;econd way, it promotes indu&s;try; and though it increa&s;es the con&s;umption of the &s;ociety, it provides a permanent fund for &s;upporting that con&s;umption, the people who con&s;ume, re-producing, with a profit, the whole value of their annual con&s;umption. The gro&s;s revenue of the &s;ociety, the annual produce of their land and labour, is increa&s;ed by the whole value which the labour of tho&s;e workmen adds to the materials upon which they are employed; and their neat revenue by what remains of this value, after deducting what is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting the tools and in&s;truments of their trade.</P>
<P>THAT the greater part of the gold and &s;ilver which, being forced abroad by tho&s;e operations of banking, is employed in purcha&s;ing foreign goods for home con&s;umption, is and mu&s;t be employed in purcha&s;ing tho&s;e of this &s;econd kind, &s;eems, not only probable, but almo&s;t unavoidable. Though &s;ome particular men may &s;ome|times increa&s;e their expence very con&s;iderably though their revenue does not increa&s;e at all, we may be a&s;&s;ured that no cla&s;s or order of men ever does &s;o; becau&s;e, though the principles of common prudence do not always govern the conduct of every individual, they always influence that of the majority of every cla&s;s or order. But the revenue of idle people, con&s;idered as a cla&s;s or order, cannot, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, be increa&s;ed by tho&s;e operations of banking. Their expence in general, therefore, cannot be much increa&s;ed by them, though that of a few individuals among them may, and in reality &s;ometimes is. The demand of idle people, therefore, for foreign goods, being the &s;ame, or very nearly the &s;ame, as before, a very &s;mall part of the money, which being forced abroad by tho&s;e operations of banking, is employed in purcha&s;ing foreign goods for home con&s;umption, is likely to be employed in purcha&s;ing tho&s;e for their u&s;e. The greater part of it will naturally
<PB N="355" REF="367">
be de&s;tined for the employment of indu&s;try, and not for the main|tenance of idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN we compute the quantity of indu&s;try which the cir|culating capital of any &s;ociety can employ, we mu&s;t always have regard to tho&s;e parts of it only, which con&s;i&s;t in provi&s;ions, mate|rials, and fini&s;hed work: the other, which con&s;i&s;ts in money, and which &s;erves only to circulate tho&s;e three, mu&s;t always be deducted. In order to put indu&s;try into motion, three things are requi&s;ite; materials to work upon, tools to work with, and the wages or recompence for the &s;ake of which the work is done. Money is neither a material to work upon, nor a tool to work with; and though the wages of the workman are commonly paid to him in money, his real revenue, like that of all other men, con&s;i&s;ts, not in the money, but in the money's worth; not in the metal pieces, but in what can be got for them.</P>
<P>THE quantity of indu&s;try which any capital can employ, mu&s;t, evidently, be equal to the number of workmen whom it can &s;upply with materials, tools, and a maintenance &s;uitable to the nature of the work. Money may be requi&s;ite for purcha&s;ing the mate|rials and tools of the work, as well as the maintenance of the workmen. But the quantity of indu&s;try which the whole capital can employ, is certainly not equal both to the money which pur|cha&s;es, and to the materials, tools, and maintenance, which are purcha&s;ed with it; but only to one or other of tho&s;e two values, and to the latter more properly than to the former.</P>
<P>WHEN paper is &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of gold and &s;ilver money, the quantity of the materials, tools, and maintenance, which the whole circulating capital can &s;upply, may be increa&s;ed by the whole value of gold and &s;ilver which u&s;ed to be employed in purcha&s;ing
<PB N="356" REF="368">
them. The whole value of the great wheel of circulation and di&s;tribution, is added to the goods which are circulated and di&s;tributed by means of it. The operation, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re|&s;embles that of the undertaker of &s;ome great work, who, in con&s;e|quence of &s;ome improvement in mechanicks, takes down his old machinery, and adds the difference between its price and that of the new to his circulating capital, to the fund from which he fur|ni&s;hes materials and wages to his workmen.</P>
<P>WHAT is the proportion which the circulating money of any country bears to the whole value of the annual produce circulated by means of it, it is, perhaps, impo&s;&s;ible to determine. It has been computed by different authors at a fifth, at a tenth, at a twentieth, and at a thirtieth part of that value. But how &s;mall &s;oever the proportion which the circulating money may bear to the whole value of the annual produce, as but a part, and fre|quently but a &s;mall part, of that produce, is ever de&s;tined for the maintenance of indu&s;try, it mu&s;t always bear a very con&s;iderable proportion to that part. When, therefore, by the &s;ub&s;titution of paper, the gold and &s;ilver nece&s;&s;ary for circulation is reduced to, perhaps, a fifth part of the former quantity, if the value of only the greater part of the other four-fifths be added to the funds which are de&s;tined for the maintenance of indu&s;try, it mu&s;t make a very con&s;iderable addition to the quantity of that indu&s;try, and, con|&s;equently, to the value of the annual produce of land and labour.</P>
<P>AN operation of this kind has, within the&s;e five and twenty or thirty years, been performed in Scotland, by the erection of new banking companies in almo&s;t every con&s;iderable town, and even in &s;ome country villages. The effects of it have been preci&s;ely tho&s;e above de&s;cribed. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the country is almo&s;t entirely
<PB N="357" REF="369">
carried on by means of the paper of tho&s;e different banking companies, with which purcha&s;es and payments of all kinds are commonly made. Silver very &s;eldom appears, except in the change of a twenty &s;hillings bank note, and gold &s;till &s;eldomer. But though the conduct of all tho&s;e different companies has not been unexceptionable, and has accordingly required an act of parliament to regulate it; the country, notwith&s;tanding, has evidently derived great benefit from their trade. I have heard it a&s;&s;erted, that the trade of the city of Gla&s;gow doubled in about fifteen years after the fir&s;t erection of the banks there; and that the trade of Scotland has more than quadrupled &s;ince the fir&s;t erection of the two publick banks at Edinburgh, of which the one, called The Bank of Scotland, was e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of parliament in 1695, the other, called The Royal Bank, by royal charter in 1727. Whether the trade, either of Scotland in general, or of the city of Gla&s;gow in particular, has really increa&s;ed in &s;o great a proportion, during &s;o &s;hort a period, I do not pretend to know. If either of them has increa&s;ed in this proportion, it &s;eems to be an effect too great to be accounted for by the &s;ole operation of this cau&s;e. That the trade and indu&s;try of Scotland, however, have increa&s;ed very con&s;iderably during this period, and that the banks have contributed a good deal to this increa&s;e, cannot be doubted.</P>
<P>THE value of the &s;ilver money which circulated in Scotland before the union, in 1707, and which immediately after it was brought into the bank of Scotland in order to be re-coined, amounted to 411,117l. ros. 9d. &s;terling. No account has been got of the gold coin; but it appears from the antient accounts of the mint of Scotland, that the value of the gold annually coined &s;omewhat exceeded that of the &s;ilver <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Rudiman's Preface to Ander&s;on's Diplomata, &amp;c. Scotiae.</NOTE>. There were a good many people too upon this occa&s;ion, who, from a diffidence of re|payment,
<PB N="358" REF="370">
did not bring their &s;ilver into the bank of Scotland; and there was, be&s;ides, &s;ome Engli&s;h coin, which was not called in. The whole value of the gold and &s;ilver, therefore, which circulated in Scotland before the union, cannot be e&s;timated at le&s;s than a million &s;terling. It &s;eems to have con&s;tituted almo&s;t the whole circulation of that country; for though the circulation of the bank of Scotland, which had then no rival, was con|&s;iderable, it &s;eems to have made but a very &s;mall part of the whole. In the pre&s;ent times the whole circulation of Scotland cannot be e&s;timated at le&s;s than two millions, of which that part which con&s;i&s;ts in gold and &s;ilver, mo&s;t probably, does not amount to half a million. But though the circulating gold and &s;ilver of Scotland have &s;uffered &s;o great a diminution during this period, its real riches and pro&s;perity do not appear to have &s;uffered any. Its agriculture, manufactures, and trade, on the contrary, the annual produce of its land and labour, have evidently been augmented.</P>
<P>IT is chiefly by di&s;counting bills of exchange, that is, by ad|vancing money upon them before they are due, that the greater part of banks and bankers i&s;&s;ue their promi&s;&s;ory notes. They deduct always, upon whatever &s;um they advance, the legal intere&s;t till the bill &s;hall become due. The payment of the bill, when it becomes due, replaces to the bank the value of what had been advanced, together with a clear profit of the intere&s;t. The banker who advances to the merchant who&s;e bill he di&s;counts, not gold and &s;ilver, but his own promi&s;&s;ory notes, has the advantage of being able to di&s;count to a greater amount, by the whole value of his promi&s;&s;ory notes, which he finds by experience, are commonly in circulation. He is thereby enabled to make his clear gain of intere&s;t on &s;o much a larger &s;um.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="371">
THE commerce of Scotland, which at pre&s;ent is not very great, was &s;till more incon&s;iderable when the two fir&s;t banking com|panies were e&s;tabli&s;hed; and tho&s;e companies would have had but little trade, had they confined their bu&s;ine&s;s to the di&s;counting of bills of exchange. They invented, therefore, another method of i&s;&s;uing their promi&s;&s;ary notes; by granting, what they called, ca&s;h accounts, that is, by giving credit to the extent of a certain &s;um, (two or three thou&s;and pounds, for example), to any individual who could procure two per&s;ons of undoubted credit and good landed e&s;tate to become &s;urety for him, that whatever money &s;hould be advanced to him, within the &s;um for which the credit had been given, &s;hould be repaid upon demand, together with the legal intere&s;t. Credits of this kind are, I believe, commonly granted by banks and bankers in all different parts of the world. But the ea&s;y terms upon which the Scotch banking companies accept of re-payment are, &s;o far as I know, peculiar to them, and have, perhaps, been the principal cau&s;e, both of the great trade of tho&s;e companies, and of the benefit which the country has received from it.</P>
<P>WHOEVER has a credit of this kind with one of tho&s;e companies, and borrows a thou&s;and pounds upon it, for example, may repay this &s;um piece-meal, by twenty and thirty pounds at a time, the company di&s;counting a proportionable part of the intere&s;t of the great &s;um from the day on which each of tho&s;e &s;mall &s;ums is paid in, till the whole be in this manner repaid. All merchants, there|fore, and almo&s;t all men of bu&s;ine&s;s, find it convenient to keep &s;uch ca&s;h accounts with them, and are thereby intere&s;ted to pro|mote the trade of tho&s;e companies, by readily receiving their notes in all payments, and by encouraging all tho&s;e with whom they have any influence to do the &s;ame. The banks, when their cu&s;tomers apply to them for money, generally advance it to them in their own
<PB N="360" REF="372">
promi&s;&s;ary notes. The&s;e the merchants pay away to the manu|facturers for goods, the manufacturers to the farmers for mate|rials and provi&s;ions, the farmers to their landlords for rent, the landlords repay them to the merchants for the conveniencies and luxuries with which they &s;upply them, and the merchants again return them to the banks in order to balance their ca&s;h accounts, or to replace what they may have borrowed of them; and thus almo&s;t the whole money bu&s;ine&s;s of the country is tran&s;acted by means of them. Hence, the great trade of tho&s;e companies.</P>
<P>BY means of tho&s;e ca&s;h accounts every merchant can, without imprudence, carry on a greater trade than he otherwi&s;e could do. If there are two merchants, one in London, and the other in Edinburgh, who employ equal &s;tocks in the &s;ame branch of trade, the Edinburgh merchant can, without imprudence, carry on a greater trade, and give employment to a greater number of people than the London merchant. The London merchant mu&s;t always keep by him a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, either in his own coffers, or in tho&s;e of his banker, who gives him no intere&s;t for it, in order to an&s;wer the demands continually coming upon him for payment of the goods which he purcha&s;es upon credit. Let the ordinary amount of this &s;um be &s;uppo&s;ed five hundred pounds. The value of the goods in his warehou&s;e mu&s;t always be le&s;s by five hundred pounds than it would have been, had he not been obliged to keep &s;uch a &s;um unemployed. Let us &s;uppo&s;e that he generally di&s;po&s;es of his whole &s;tock upon hand, or of goods to the value of his whole &s;tock upon hand, once in the year. By being obliged to keep &s;o great a &s;um unemployed, he mu&s;t &s;ell in a year five hundred pounds worth le&s;s goods than he might otherwi&s;e have done. His annual profits mu&s;t be le&s;s by all that he could have made by the &s;ale of five hundred pounds worth more goods; and the number of people employed in pre|paring his goods for the market, mu&s;t be le&s;s by all tho&s;e that
<PB N="361" REF="373">
five hundred pounds more &s;tock could have employed. The merchant in Edinburgh, on the other hand, keeps no money unemployed for an&s;wering &s;uch occa&s;ional demands. When they actually come upon him, he &s;atisfies them from his ca&s;h account with the bank, and gradually replaces the &s;um borrowed with the money or paper which comes in from the occa&s;ional &s;ales of his goods. With the &s;ame &s;tock, therefore, he can, without imprudence, have at all times in his warehou&s;e a larger quantity of goods than the London merchant; and can thereby both make a greater profit him&s;elf, and give con&s;tant employment to a greater number of indu&s;trious people who prepare tho&s;e goods for the market. Hence the great benefit which the country has derived from this trade.</P>
<P>THE facility of di&s;counting bills of exchange, it may be thought indeed, gives the Engli&s;h merchants a conveniency equivalent to the ca&s;h accounts of the Scotch merchants. But the Scotch merchants, it mu&s;t be remembered, can di&s;count their bills of ex|change as ea&s;ily as the Engli&s;h merchants, and have, be&s;ides, the additional conveniency of their ca&s;h accounts.</P>
<P>THE whole paper money of every kind which can ea&s;ily circu|late in any country never can exceed the value of the gold and &s;ilver, of which it &s;upplies the place, or which (the commerce being &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;ame) would circulate there, if there was no paper money. If twenty &s;hilling notes, for example, are the lowe&s;t paper money current in Scotland, the whole of that cur|rency which can ea&s;ily circulate there cannot exceed the &s;um of gold and &s;ilver, which would be nece&s;&s;ary for tran&s;acting the annual exchanges of twenty &s;hillings value and upwards u&s;ually tran&s;acted within that country. Should the circulating paper at any time exceed that &s;um, as the exce&s;s could neither
<PB N="362" REF="374">
be &s;ent abroad nor be employed in the circulation of the country, it mu&s;t immediately return upon the banks to be exchanged for gold and &s;ilver. Many people would immediately perceive that they had more of this paper than was nece&s;&s;ary for tran&s;acting their bu&s;ine&s;s at home, and as they could not &s;end it abroad, they would immediately demand payment of it from the banks. When this &s;uperfluous paper was converted into gold and &s;ilver, they could ea&s;ily find a u&s;e for it by &s;ending it abroad; but they could find none while it remained in the &s;hape of paper. There would immediately, therefore, be a run upon the banks to the whole extent of this &s;uperfluous paper, and, if they &s;howed any difficulty or backwardne&s;s in payment, to a much greater extent; the alarm, which this would occa&s;ion, nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;ing the run.</P>
<P>OVER and above the expences which are common to every branch of trade; &s;uch as the expence of hou&s;e-rent, the wages of &s;ervants, clerks, accountants, &amp;c.; the expences peculiar to a bank con&s;i&s;t chiefly in two articles: Fir&s;t, in the expence of keep|ing at all times in its coffers, for an&s;wering the occa&s;ional demands of the holders of its notes, a large &s;um of money, of which it lo&s;es the intere&s;t: And, &s;econdly, in the expence of repleni&s;hing tho&s;e coffers as fa&s;t as they are emptied by an&s;wering &s;uch occa|&s;ional demands.</P>
<P>A BANKING company which i&s;&s;ues more paper than can be employed in the circulation of the country, and of which the exce&s;s is continually returning upon them for payment, ought to increa&s;e the quantity of gold and &s;ilver, which they keep at all times in their coffers, not only in proportion to this exce&s;&s;ive increa&s;e of their circulation, but in a much greater proportion; their notes returning upon them much fa&s;ter than in proportion
<PB N="363" REF="375">
to the exce&s;s of their quantity. Such a company, therefore, ought to increa&s;e the fir&s;t article of their expence, not only in proportion to this forced increa&s;e of their bu&s;ine&s;s, but in a much greater proportion.</P>
<P>THE coffers of &s;uch a company too, though they ought to be filled much fuller, yet mu&s;t empty them&s;elves much fa&s;ter than if their bu&s;ine&s;s was confined within more rea&s;onable bounds, and mu&s;t require, not only a more violent, but a more con&s;tant and uninterrupted exertion of expence in order to repleni&s;h them. The coin too, which is thus continually drawn in &s;uch large quantities from their coffers, cannot be employed in the circula|tion of the country. It comes in place of a paper which is over and above what can be employed in that circulation, and is there|fore, over and above what can be employed in it too. But as that coin will not be allowed to lie idle, it mu&s;t, in one &s;hape or another, be &s;ent abroad, in order to find that profitable employ|ment which it cannot find at home; and this continual exportation of gold and &s;ilver, by enhancing the difficulty, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily enhance &s;till further the expence of the bank, in finding new gold and &s;ilver in order to repleni&s;h tho&s;e coffers, which empty them&s;elves &s;o very rapidly. Such a company, therefore, mu&s;t, in proportion to this forced increa&s;e of their bu&s;ine&s;s, increa&s;e the &s;econd article of their expence &s;till more than the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>LET us &s;uppo&s;e that all the paper of a particular bank, which the circulation of the country can ea&s;ily ab&s;orb and employ, amounts exactly to forty thou&s;and pounds; and that for an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands, this bank is obliged to keep at all times in its coffers ten thou&s;and pounds in gold and &s;ilver. Should this bank attempt to circulate forty-four thou&s;and pounds, the four thou&s;and pounds which are over and above what the circulation can ea&s;ily ab&s;orb
<PB N="364" REF="376">
and employ, will return upon it almo&s;t as fa&s;t as they are i&s;&s;ued. For an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands, therefore, this bank ought to keep at all times in its coffers, not eleven thou&s;and pounds only, but fourteen thou&s;and pounds. It will thus gain nothing by the intere&s;t of the four thou&s;and pounds exce&s;&s;ive circulation; and it will lo&s;e the whole expence of continually collecting four thou&s;and pounds in gold and &s;ilver which will be continually going out of its coffers as fa&s;t as they are brought into them.</P>
<P>HAD every particular banking company always under&s;tood and attended to its own particular intere&s;t, the circulation never could have been over&s;tocked with paper money. But every par|ticular banking company has not always under&s;tood or attended to its own particular intere&s;t, and the circulation has frequently been over&s;tocked with paper money.</P>
<P>BY i&s;&s;uing too great a quantity of paper, of which the exce&s;s was continually returning, in order to be exchanged for gold and &s;ilver, the bank of England was for many years together obliged to coin gold to the extent of between eight hundred thou&s;and pounds and a million a year; or at an average, about eight hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds. For this great coinage, the bank (in con&s;e|quence of the worn and degraded &s;tate into which the gold coin had fallen a few years ago) was frequently obliged to purcha&s;e gold bullion at the high price of four pounds an ounce, which it &s;oon after i&s;&s;ued in coin at 3l. 17s. 10d. &frac12; an ounce, lo&s;ing in this manner between two and a half and three per cent. upon the coinage of &s;o very large a &s;um. Though the bank there|fore paid no &s;eignorage, though the government was properly at the expence of the coinage, this liberality of government did not prevent altogether the expence of the bank.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="377">
THE Scotch banks, in con&s;equence of an exce&s;s of the &s;ame kind, were all obliged to employ con&s;tantly agents at London to collect money for them, at an expence which was &s;eldom below one and a half or two per cent. This money was &s;ent down by the waggon, and in&s;ured by the carriers at an additional expence of three quarters per cent. or fifteen &s;hillings on the hundred pounds. Tho&s;e agents were not always able to repleni&s;h the coffers of their employers &s;o fa&s;t as they were emptied. In this ca&s;e the re&s;ource of the banks was, to draw upon their corre&s;pon|dents in London bills of exchange to the extent of the &s;um which they wanted. When tho&s;e corre&s;pondents afterwards drew upon them for the payment of this &s;um, together with the intere&s;t, and a commi&s;&s;ion, &s;ome of tho&s;e banks, from the di&s;tre&s;s into which their exce&s;&s;ive circulation had thrown them, had &s;ometimes no other means of &s;atisfying this draught but by drawing a &s;econd &s;ett of bills either upon the &s;ame, or upon &s;ome other corre&s;pondents in London; and the &s;ame &s;um, or rather bills for the &s;ame &s;um, would in this manner make &s;ometimes more than two or three journies; the debtor, bank, paying always the in|tere&s;t and commi&s;&s;ion upon the whole accumulated &s;um. Even tho&s;e Scotch banks which never di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their extream imprudence, were &s;ometimes obliged to employ this ruinous re&s;ource.</P>
<P>THE gold coin which was paid out either by the bank of England, or by the Scotch banks, in exchange for that part of their paper which was over and above what could be employed in the circulation of the country, being likewi&s;e over and above what could be employed in that circulation, was &s;ometimes &s;ent abroad in the &s;hape of coin, &s;ometimes melted down and &s;ent abroad in the &s;hape of bullion, and &s;ometimes melted down and &s;old to the bank of England at the high price of four pounds
<PB N="366" REF="378">
an ounce. It was the newe&s;t, the heavie&s;t, and the be&s;t pieces only which were carefully picked out of the whole coin, and either &s;ent abroad or melted down. At home, and while they remained in the &s;hape of coin, tho&s;e heavy pieces were of no more value than the light: But they were of more value abroad, or when melted down into bullion, at home. The bank of England, notwith&s;tanding their great annual coinage, found to their a&s;toni&s;hment, that there was every year the &s;ame &s;carcity of coin as there had been the year before; and that notwith&s;tanding the great quantity of good and new coin which was every year i&s;&s;ued from the bank, the &s;tate of the coin, in&s;tead of growing better and better, became every year wor&s;e and wor&s;e. Every year they found them&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of coining nearly the &s;ame quantity of gold as they had coined the year before, and from the con|tinual ri&s;e in the price of gold bullion, in con&s;equence of the continual wearing and clipping of the coin, the expence of this great annual coinage became every year greater and greater. The bank of England, it is to be ob&s;erved, by &s;upplying its own coffers with coin, is indirectly obliged to &s;upply the whole kingdom, into which coin is continually flowing from tho&s;e coffers in a great variety of ways. Whatever coin therefore was wanted to &s;upport this exce&s;&s;ive circulation both of Scotch and Engli&s;h paper money, whatever vacuities this exce&s;&s;ive circulation occa&s;ioned in the nece&s;&s;ary coin of the kingdom, the bank of England was obliged to &s;upply them. The Scotch banks, no doubt, paid all of them very dearly for their own imprudence and inattention. But the bank of England paid very dearly, not only for its own imprudence, but for the much greater imprudence of almo&s;t all the Scotch banks.</P>
<P>THE over trading of &s;ome bold projectors in both parts of the united kingdom, was the original cau&s;e of this exce&s;&s;ive cir|culation of paper money.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="379">
WHAT a bank can with propriety advance to a merchant or undertaker of any kind, is not, either the whole capital with which he trades, or even any con&s;iderable part of that capital; but that part of it only, which he would otherwi&s;e be obliged to keep by him unemployed, and in ready money for an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands. If the paper money which the bank advances never exceeds this value, it can never exceed the value of the gold and &s;ilver, which would nece&s;&s;arily circulate in the country if there was no paper money; it can never exceed the quan|tity which the circulation of the country can ea&s;ily ab&s;orb and employ.</P>
<P>WHEN a bank di&s;counts to a merchant a real bill of exchange drawn by a real creditor upon a real debtor, and which, as &s;oon as it becomes due, is really paid by that debtor; it only advances to him a part of the value which he would otherwi&s;e be obliged to keep by him unemployed, and in ready money for an&s;wer|ing occa&s;ional demands. The payment of the bill, when it becomes due, replaces to the bank the value of what it had advanced, together with the intere&s;t. The coffers of the bank, &s;o far as its dealings are confined to &s;uch cu&s;tomers, re&s;emble a water pond, from which, though a &s;tream is continually running out, yet another is continually running in, fully equal to that which runs out; &s;o that, without any further care or attention, the pond keeps always equally, or very near equally full. Little or no expence can ever be nece&s;&s;ary for repleni&s;hing the coffers of &s;uch a bank.</P>
<P>A MERCHANT, without over-trading, may frequently have occa&s;ion for a &s;um of ready money, even when he has no bills to di&s;count. When a bank, be&s;ides di&s;counting his bills, advances him likewi&s;e upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, &s;uch &s;ums upon his ca&s;h account, and accepts of a piece-meal repayment as the money comes in
<PB N="368" REF="380">
from the occa&s;ional &s;ale of his goods, upon the ea&s;y terms of the banking companies of Scotland; it di&s;pen&s;es him entirely from the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping any part of his &s;tock by him unemployed, and in ready money for an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands. When &s;uch demands actually come upon him, he can an&s;wer them &s;uf|ficiently from his ca&s;h account. The bank, however, in deal|ing with &s;uch cu&s;tomers, ought to ob&s;erve with great attention, whether in the cour&s;e of &s;ome &s;hort period (of four, five, &s;ix, or eight months, for example) the &s;um of the repayments which it commonly receives from them, is, or is not, fully equal to that of the advances which it commonly makes to them. If, within the cour&s;e of &s;uch &s;hort periods, the &s;um of the re|payments from certain cu&s;tomers is, upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions, fully equal to that of the advances, it may &s;afely continue to deal with &s;uch cu&s;tomers. Though the &s;tream which is in this ca&s;e continually running out from its coffers may be very large, that which is continually running into them mu&s;t be at lea&s;t equally large; &s;o that without any further care or attention tho&s;e coffers are likely to be always equally or very near equally full; and &s;carce ever to require any extraordinary expence to repleni&s;h them. If, on the contrary, the &s;um of the repayments from certain other cu&s;tomers falls commonly very much &s;hort of the advances which it makes to them, it cannot with any &s;afety continue to deal with &s;uch cu&s;tomers, at lea&s;t if they continue to deal with it in this manner. The &s;tream which is in this ca&s;e continually running out from its coffers is nece&s;&s;arily much larger than that which is continually running in; &s;o that, unle&s;s they are reple|ni&s;hed by &s;ome great and continual effort of expence, tho&s;e coffers mu&s;t &s;oon be exhau&s;ted altogether.</P>
<P>THE banking companies of Scotland, accordingly, were for a long time very careful to require frequent and regular repay|ments
<PB N="369" REF="381">
from all their cu&s;tomers, and did not care to deal with any per&s;on, whatever might be his fortune or credit, who did not make, what they called, frequent and regular operations with them. By this attention, be&s;ides &s;aving almo&s;t entirely the extraordinary expence of repleni&s;hing their coffers, they gained two other very con&s;iderable advantages.</P>
<P>FIRST, by this attention they were enabled to make &s;ome tolerable judgement concerning the thriving or declining cir|cum&s;tances of their debtors, without being obliged to look out for any other evidence be&s;ides what their own books afforded them; men being for the mo&s;t part either regular or irregular in their repayments, according as their circum&s;tances are either thriving or declining. A private man who lends out his money to perhaps half a dozen or a dozen of debtors, may, either by him&s;elf or his agents, ob&s;erve and enquire both con&s;tantly and carefully into the conduct and &s;ituation of each of them. But a banking company, which lends money to perhaps five hundred different people, and of which the attention is continually occu|pied by objects of a very different kind, can have no regular information concerning the conduct and circum&s;tances of the greater part of its debtors beyond what its own books afford it. In requiring frequent and regular re-payments from all their cu&s;tomers, the banking companies of Scotland had probably this advantage in view.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, by this attention they &s;ecured them&s;elves from the po&s;&s;ibility of i&s;&s;uing more paper money than what the cir|culation of the country could ea&s;ily ab&s;orb and employ. When they ob&s;erved that within moderate periods of time the re-pay|ments of a particular cu&s;tomer were upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions fully equal to the advances which they had made to him, they might
<PB N="370" REF="382">
be a&s;&s;ured that the paper money which they had advanced to him, had not at any time exceeded the quantity of gold and &s;ilver which he would otherwi&s;e have been obliged to keep by him for an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands; and that con&s;equently the paper money which they had circulated by his means had not at any time exceeded the quantity of gold and &s;ilver which would have circulated in the country, had there been no paper money. The frequency, regularity and amount of his re-payments would &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate that the amount of their advances had at no time exceeded that part of his capital which he would otherwi&s;e have been obliged to keep by him unemployed, and in ready money for an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands; that is, for the purpo&s;e of keeping the re&s;t of his capital in con&s;tant employment. It is this part of his capital only which, within moderate periods of time, is continually returning to every dealer in the &s;hape of money, whether paper or coin, and continually going from him in the &s;ame &s;hape. If the advances of the bank had commonly exceeded this part of his capital, the ordinary amount of his re-payments could not, within moderate periods of time, have equalled the ordinary amount of its advances. The &s;tream which, by means of his dealings, was continually running into the coffers of the bank, could not have been equal to the &s;tream which, by means of the &s;ame dealings, was con|tinually running out. The advances of the bank paper, by exceed|ing the quantity of gold and &s;ilver which, had there been no &s;uch advances, he would have been obliged to keep by him for an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands, might &s;oon come to exceed the whole quantity of gold and &s;ilver which (the commerce being &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;ame) would have circulated in the country had there been no paper money; and con&s;equently to exceed the quantity which the cir|culation of the country could ea&s;ily ab&s;orb and employ; and the exce&s;s of this paper money would immediately have returned upon
<PB N="371" REF="383">
the bank in order to be exchanged for gold and &s;ilver. This &s;econd advantage, though equally real, was not perhaps &s;o well under&s;tood by all the different banking companies of Scotland as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>WHEN, partly by the conveniency of di&s;counting bills, and partly by that of ca&s;h accounts, the creditable traders of any country can be di&s;pen&s;ed from the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping any part of their &s;tock by them, unemployed and in ready money, for an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands, they can rea&s;onably expect no further a&s;&s;i&s;tance from banks and bankers, who, when they have gone thus far, cannot, con&s;i&s;tently with their own intere&s;t and &s;afety, go farther. A bank cannot, con&s;i&s;tently with its own intere&s;t, advance to a trader the whole or even the greater part of the circulating capital with which he trades; becau&s;e, though that capital is continually returning to him in the &s;hape of money, and going from him in the &s;ame &s;hape, yet the whole of the re|turns is too di&s;tant from the whole of the out-goings, and the &s;um of his repayments could not equal the &s;um of its advances within &s;uch moderate periods of time as &s;uit the conveniency of a bank. Still le&s;s could a bank afford to advance him any con|&s;iderable part of his fixed capital; of the capital which the un|dertaker of an iron forge, for example, employs in erecting his forge and &s;melting-hou&s;e, his work-hou&s;es and warehou&s;es, the dwelling hou&s;es of his workmen, &amp;c.; of the capital which the undertaker of a mine employs in &s;inking his &s;hafts, in erecting engines for drawing out the water, in making roads and waggon|ways, &amp;c.; of the capital which the per&s;on who undertakes to improve land employs in clearing, draining, enclo&s;ing, manuring and ploughing wa&s;te and uncultivated fields, in building farm-hou&s;es, with all their nece&s;&s;ary appendages of &s;tables, granaries, &amp;c. The returns of the fixed capital are in almo&s;t all ca&s;es much &s;lower than tho&s;e of the circulating capital; and &s;uch expences,
<PB N="372" REF="384">
even when laid out with the greate&s;t prudence and judgement, very &s;eldom return to the undertaker till after a period of many years, a period by far too di&s;tant to &s;uit the conveniency of a bank. Traders and other undertakers may, no doubt, with great propriety, carry on a very con&s;iderable part of their projects with borrowed money. In ju&s;tice to their creditors, however, their own capital ought, in this ca&s;e, to be &s;ufficient to en&s;ure, if I may &s;ay &s;o, the capital of tho&s;e creditors; or to render it ex|treamly improbable that tho&s;e creditors &s;hould incur any lo&s;s, even though the &s;ucce&s;s of the project &s;hould fall very much &s;hort of the expectation of the projectors. Even with this precaution too, the money which is borrowed, and which it is meant &s;hould not be repaid till after a period of &s;everal years, ought not to be borrowed of a bank, but ought to be borrowed upon bond or mortgage, of &s;uch private people as propo&s;e to live upon the intere&s;t of their money, without taking the trouble them&s;elves to employ the capital; and who are upon that account willing to lend that capital to &s;uch people of good credit as are likely to keep it for &s;everal years. A bank, indeed, which lends its money without the expence of &s;tampt paper, or of attornies fees for drawing bonds and mortgages, and which accepts of repayment upon the ea&s;y terms of the banking companies of Scotland; would, no doubt, be a very convenient creditor to &s;uch traders and undertakers. But &s;uch traders and undertakers would, &s;urely, be mo&s;t inconvenient debtors to &s;uch a bank.</P>
<P>IT is now more than five and twenty years &s;ince the paper money i&s;&s;ued by the different banking companies of Scotland was fully equal, or rather was &s;omewhat more than fully equal to what the circulation of the country could ea&s;ily ab&s;orb and employ. Tho&s;e companies, therefore, had &s;o long ago given all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the traders and other undertakers of Scotland
<PB N="373" REF="385">
which it is po&s;&s;ible for banks and bankers, con&s;i&s;tently with their own intere&s;t, to give. They had even done &s;omewhat more. They had over-traded a little, and had brought upon them|&s;elves that lo&s;s, or at lea&s;t that diminution of profit, which in this particular bu&s;ine&s;s never fails to attend the &s;malle&s;t degree of over-trading. Tho&s;e traders and other undertakers, having got &s;o much a&s;&s;i&s;tance from banks and bankers, wi&s;hed to get &s;till more. The banks, they &s;eem to have thought, could extend their credits to whatever &s;um might be wanted, without incurring any other expence be&s;ides that of a few reams of paper. They complained of the contracted views and da&s;tardly &s;pirit of the directors of tho&s;e banks, which did not, they &s;aid, extend their credits in proportion to the exten&s;ion of the trade of the coun|try; meaning, no doubt, by the exten&s;ion of that trade, the exten&s;ion of their own projects beyond what they could carry on, either with their own capital, or with what they had credit to borrow of private people in the u&s;ual way of bond or mort|gage. The banks, they &s;eem to have thought, were in honour bound to &s;upply the deficiency, and to provide them with all the capital which they wanted to trade with. The banks, how|ever, were of a different opinion, and upon their refu&s;ing to extend their credits, &s;ome of tho&s;e traders had recour&s;e to an expedient which, for a time, &s;erved their purpo&s;e, though at a much greater expence, yet as effectually as the utmo&s;t exten&s;ion of bank credits could have done. This expedient was no other than the well-known &s;hift of drawing and re-drawing; the &s;hift to which unfortunate traders have &s;ometimes recour&s;e when they are upon the brink of bankruptcy. The practice of rai&s;ing money in this manner had been long known in England, and during the cour&s;e of the late war, when the high profits of trade afforded a great temptation to over-trading, is &s;aid to have been carried on to a very great extent. From England it was

<P>THE practice of drawing and re-drawing is &s;o well known to all men of bu&s;ine&s;s, that it may perhaps be thought unnece&s;&s;ary to give any account of it. But as this book may come into the hands of many people, who are not men of bu&s;ine&s;s, and as the effects of this practice upon the banking trade are not perhaps generally under&s;tood even by men of bu&s;ine&s;s them|&s;elves, I &s;hall endeavour to explain it as di&s;tinctly as I can.</P>
<P>THE cu&s;toms of merchants, which were e&s;tabli&s;hed when the barbarous laws of Europe did not enforce the performance of their contracts, and which during the cour&s;e of the two la&s;t centuries have been adopted into the laws of all European nations, have given &s;uch extraordinary privileges to bills of exchange, that money is more readily advanced upon them, than upon any other &s;pecies of obligation; e&s;pecially when they are made payable within &s;o &s;hort a period as two or three months after their date. If when the bill becomes due, the acceptor does not pay it as &s;oon as it is pre&s;ented, he becomes from that moment a bankrupt. The bill is prote&s;ted, and returns upon the drawer, who, if he does not immediately pay it, becomes likewi&s;e a bankrupt. If before it came to the per&s;on who pre&s;ents it to the acceptor for pay|ment, it had pa&s;&s;ed through the hands of &s;everal other per&s;ons, who had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively advanced to one another the contents of it either in money or goods, and who, to expre&s;s that each of them had in his turn received tho&s;e contents, had all of them in their order endor&s;ed, that is, written their names upon the back of the bill; each endor&s;er becomes in his turn liable to the owner
<PB N="375" REF="387">
of the bill for tho&s;e contents, and if he fails to pay he becomes too from that moment a bankrupt. Though the drawer, ac|ceptor, and endor&s;ers of the bill &s;hould, all of them, be per&s;ons of doubtful credit; yet &s;till the &s;hortne&s;s of the date gives &s;ome &s;ecurity to the owner of the bill. Though all of them may be very likely to become bankrupts; it is a chance if they all become &s;o in &s;o &s;hort a time. The hou&s;e is crazy, &s;ays a weary traveller to him&s;elf, and will not &s;tand very long; but it is a chance if it falls to-night, and I will venture, therefore, to &s;leep in it to-night.</P>
<P>THE trader A in Edinburgh, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, draws a bill upon B in London, payable two months after date. In reality B in London owes nothing to A in Edinburgh; but he agrees to accept of A's bill, upon condition that before the term of payment he &s;hall redraw upon A in Edinburgh, for the &s;ame &s;um, together with the intere&s;t and a commi&s;&s;ion, another bill, payable likewi&s;e two months after date. B accordingly, before the expiration of the fir&s;t two months, re-draws this bill upon A in Edinburgh; who again, before the expiration of the &s;econd two months, draws a &s;econd bill upon B in London, payable likewi&s;e two months after date; and before the expiration of the third two months, B in London re-draws upon A in Edinburgh an|other bill, payable al&s;o two months after date. This practice has &s;ometimes gone on, not only for &s;everal months, but for &s;everal years together, the bill always returning upon A in Edinburgh, with the accumulated intere&s;t and commi&s;&s;ion of all the former bills. The intere&s;t was five per cent. in the year, and the commi&s;&s;ion was never le&s;s than one half per cent. on each draught. This commi&s;&s;ion being repeated more than &s;ix times in the year, whatever money A might rai&s;e by this ex|pedient mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have co&s;t him &s;omething more than eight
<PB N="376" REF="388">
per cent. in the year, and &s;ometimes a great deal more; when either the price of the commi&s;&s;ion happened to ri&s;e, or when he was obliged to pay compound intere&s;t upon the intere&s;t and commi&s;&s;ion of former bills. This practice was called rai&s;ing money by circulation.</P>
<P>IN a country where the ordinary profits of &s;tock in the greater part of mercantile projects are &s;uppo&s;ed to run between &s;ix and ten per cent.; it mu&s;t have been a very fortunate &s;pe|culation of which the returns could not only repay the enor|mous expence at which the money was thus borrowed for car|rying it on; but afford, be&s;ides, a good &s;urplus profit to the pro|jector. Many va&s;t and exten&s;ive projects, however, were under|taken, and for &s;everal years carried on without any other fund to &s;upport them be&s;ides what was rai&s;ed at this enormous expence. The projectors, no doubt, had in their golden dreams the mo&s;t di&s;tinct vi&s;ion of this great profit. Upon their awaking, however, either at the end of their projects, or when they were no longer able to carry them on, they very &s;eldom, I believe, had the good fortune to find it.</P>
<P>THE bills which A in Edinburgh drew upon B in London, he regularly di&s;counted two months before they were due with &s;ome bank or banker in Edinburgh; and the bills which B in London re-drew upon A in Edinburgh, he as regularly di&s;counted either with the bank of England, or with &s;ome other bankers in Lon|don. Whatever was advanced upon &s;uch circulating bills was, in Edinburgh, advanced in the paper of the Scotch banks, and in London, when they were di&s;counted at the bank of England, in the paper of that bank. Though the bills upon which this paper had been advanced, were all of them repaid in their turn as &s;oon as they became due; yet the value which had been really ad|vanced
<PB N="377" REF="389">
upon the fir&s;t bill, was never really returned to the banks which advanced it; becau&s;e before each bill became due, another bill was always drawn to &s;omewhat a greater amount than the bill which was &s;oon to be paid; and the di&s;counting of this other bill was e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary towards the payment of that which was &s;oon to be due. This payment, therefore, was altogether fictiti|ous. The &s;tream, which by means of tho&s;e circulating bills of exchange, had once been made to run out from the coffers of the banks, was never replaced by any &s;tream which really run into them.</P>
<P>THE paper which was i&s;&s;ued upon tho&s;e circulating bills of exchange, amounted, upon many occa&s;ions, to the whole fund de&s;tined for carrying on &s;ome va&s;t and exten&s;ive project of agri|culture, commerce, or manufactures; and not merely to that part of it which, had there been no paper money, the projector would have been obliged to keep by him, unemployed and in ready money, for an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands. The greater part of this paper was, con&s;equently, over and above the value of the gold and &s;ilver which would have circulated in the country, had there been no paper money. It was over and above, therefore, what the circulation of the country could ea&s;ily ab&s;orb and em|ploy, and, upon that account, immediately returned upon the banks in order to be exchanged for gold and &s;ilver, which they were to find as they could. It was a capital which tho&s;e projectors had very artfully contrived to draw from tho&s;e banks, not only without their knowledge or deliberate con&s;ent, but for &s;ome time, perhaps, without their having the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;u&s;picion that they had really advanced it.</P>
<P>WHEN two people, who are continually drawing and re-drawing upon one another, di&s;count their bills always with the &s;ame banker,
<PB N="378" REF="390">
he mu&s;t immediately di&s;cover what they are about, and &s;ee clearly that they are trading, not with any capital of their own, but with the capital which he advances to them. But this di&s;covery is not al|together &s;o ea&s;y when they di&s;count their bills &s;ometimes with one banker, and &s;ometimes with another, and when the &s;ame two per|&s;ons do not con&s;tantly draw and re-draw upon one another, but occa&s;ionally run the round of a great circle of projectors, who find it for their intere&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t one another in this method of rai&s;ing money, and to render it, upon that account, as difficult as po&s;|&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h between a real and a fictitious bill of exchange; between a bill drawn by a real creditor upon a real debtor, and a bill for which there was properly no real creditor but the bank which di&s;counted it; nor any real debtor but the projector who made u&s;e of the money. When a banker had even made this di&s;covery, he might &s;ometimes make it too late, and might find that he had already di&s;counted the bills of tho&s;e projectors to &s;o great an extent, that by refu&s;ing to di&s;count any more, he would nece&s;&s;arily make them all bankrupts, and thus, by ruining them, might perhaps ruin him&s;elf. For his own intere&s;t and &s;afety, therefore, he might find it nece&s;&s;ary, in this very perilous &s;ituation, to go on for &s;ome time, endeavouring, however, to withdraw gradually, and upon that account making every day greater and greater difficulties about di&s;counting, in order to force tho&s;e projec|tors by degrees to have recour&s;e, either to other bankers, or to other methods of rai&s;ing money; &s;o as that he him&s;elf might, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, get out of the circle. The difficulties, accordingly, which the bank of England, which the principal bankers in London, and which even the more prudent Scotch banks began, after a certain time, and when all of them had already gone too far, to make about di&s;counting, not only alarmed, but enraged in the highe&s;t degree tho&s;e projectors. Their own di&s;tre&s;s, of which this prudent and nece&s;&s;ary re&s;erve of the banks, was, no
<PB N="379" REF="391">
doubt, the immediate occa&s;ion, they called the di&s;tre&s;s of the coun|try; and this di&s;tre&s;s of the country, they &s;aid, was altogether owing to the ignorance, pu&s;illanimity, and bad conduct of the banks, which did not give a &s;ufficiently liberal aid to the &s;pirited undertakings of tho&s;e who exerted them&s;elves in order to beautify, improve, and enrich the country. It was the duty of the banks, they &s;eemed to think, to lend for as long a time, and to as great an extent as they might wi&s;h to borrow. The banks, however, by refu&s;ing in this manner to give more credit to tho&s;e to whom they had already given a great deal too much, took the only method by which it was now po&s;&s;ible to &s;ave either their own credit, or the publick credit of the country.</P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of this clamour and di&s;tre&s;s, a new bank was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in Scotland for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of relieving the di&s;tre&s;s of the country. The de&s;ign was generous; but the execution was imprudent, and the nature and cau&s;es of the di&s;tre&s;s which it meant to relieve, were not, perhaps, well under&s;tood. This bank was more liberal than any other had ever been, both in granting ca&s;h accounts, and in di&s;counting bills of exchange. With regard to the latter, it &s;eems to have made &s;carce any di&s;tinction between real and circulating bills, but to have di&s;counted all equally. It was the avowed principle of this bank to advance, upon any rea|&s;onable &s;ecurity, the whole capital which was to be employed in improvements of which the returns are the mo&s;t &s;low and di&s;tant, &s;uch as the improvements of land. To promote &s;uch improvements was even &s;aid to be the chief of the publick &s;pirited purpo&s;es for which it was in&s;tituted. By its liberality in granting ca&s;h accounts, and in di&s;counting bills of exchange, it, no doubt, i&s;&s;ued great quantities of its bank-notes. But tho&s;e bank-notes being, the greater part of them, over and above what the circulation of the country could ea&s;ily ab&s;orb and employ, returned upon it, in
<PB N="380" REF="392">
order to be exchanged for gold and &s;ilver, as fa&s;t as they were i&s;&s;ued. Its coffers were never well filled. The capital which had been &s;ub&s;cribed to this bank at two different &s;ub&s;criptions, amounted to one hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds, of which eighty per cent. only was paid up. This &s;um ought to have been paid in at &s;everal different in&s;tallments. A great part of the proprietors, when they paid in their fir&s;t in&s;tallment, opened a ca&s;h account with the bank; and the directors, thinking them&s;elves obliged to treat their own proprietors with the &s;ame liberality with which they treated all other men, allowed many of them to borrow upon this ca&s;h account what they paid in upon all their &s;ub&s;equent in&s;tall|ments. Such payments, therefore, only put into one coffer, what had the moment before been taken out of another. But had the coffers of this bank been filled ever &s;o well, its exce&s;&s;ive circulation mu&s;t have emptied them fa&s;ter than they could have been repleni&s;hed by any other expedient but the ruinous one of drawing upon Lon|don, and when the bill became due, paying it, together with intere&s;t and commi&s;&s;ion, by another draught upon the &s;ame place. Its coffers having been filled &s;o very ill, it is &s;aid to have been driven to this re&s;ource within a very few months after it began to do bu&s;ine&s;s. The e&s;tates of the proprietors of this bank were worth &s;everal millions, and by their &s;ub&s;cription to the original bond or contract of the bank, were really pledged for an&s;wering all its engagements. By means of the great credit which &s;o great a pledge nece&s;&s;arily gave it, it was, notwith&s;tanding its too liberal conduct, enabled to carry on bu&s;ine&s;s for more than two years. When it was obliged to &s;top, it had in the circulation about two hundred thou&s;and pounds in bank-notes. In order to &s;up|port the circulation of tho&s;e notes, which were continually return|ing upon it as fa&s;t as they were i&s;&s;ued, it had been con&s;tantly in the practice of drawing bills of exchange upon London, of which the number and value were continually increa&s;ing, and,
<PB N="381" REF="393">
when it &s;topt, amounted to upwards of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds. This bank, therefore, had, in little more than the cour&s;e of two years, advanced to different people upwards of eight hundred thou&s;and pounds at five per cent. Upon the two hundred thou&s;and pounds which it circulated in bank-notes, this five per cent. might, perhaps, be con&s;idered as clear gain, without any other deduction be&s;ides the expence of management. But upon upwards of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds, for which it was continually drawing bills of exchange upon London, it was paying, in the way of intere&s;t and commi&s;&s;ion, upwards of eight per cent. and was con&s;equently lo&s;ing more than three per cent. upon more than three-fourths of all its dealings.</P>
<P>THE operations of this bank &s;eem to have produced effects quite oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e which were intended by the particular per&s;ons who planned and directed it. They &s;eem to have intended to &s;up|port the &s;pirited undertakings, for as &s;uch they con&s;idered them, which were at that time carrying on in different parts of the coun|try; and at the &s;ame time, by drawing the whole banking bu&s;ine&s;s to them&s;elves, to &s;upplant all the other Scotch banks; particularly tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed at Edinburgh, who&s;e backwardne&s;s in di&s;counting bills of exchange had given &s;ome offence. This bank, no doubt, gave &s;ome temporary relief to tho&s;e projectors, and enabled them to carry on their projects for about two years longer than they could otherwi&s;e have done. But it thereby only enabled them to get &s;o much deeper into debt, &s;o that when ruin came, it fell &s;o much the heavier both upon them and upon their creditors. The operations of this bank, therefore, in&s;tead of relieving, in reality aggravated in the long-run the di&s;tre&s;s which tho&s;e projectors had brought both upon them&s;elves and upon their country. It would have been much better for them&s;elves, their creditors and their country, had the greater part of them been obliged to &s;top two years &s;ooner
<PB N="382" REF="394">
than they actually did. The temporary relief, however, which this bank afforded to tho&s;e projectors, proved a real and permanent relief to the other Scotch banks. All the dealers in circulating bills of exchange, which tho&s;e other banks had become &s;o backward in di&s;counting, had recour&s;e to this new bank, where they were re|ceived with open arms. Tho&s;e other banks, therefore, were enabled to get very ea&s;ily out of that fatal circle, from which they could not otherwi&s;e have di&s;engaged them&s;elves without incurring a con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and perhaps too even &s;ome degree of di&s;|credit.</P>
<P>IN the long-run, therefore, the operations of this bank increa&s;ed the real di&s;tre&s;s of the country which it meant to relieve; and effectually relieved from a very great di&s;tre&s;s tho&s;e rivals whom it meant to &s;upplant.</P>
<P>AT the fir&s;t &s;etting out of this bank, it was the opinion of &s;ome people, that how fa&s;t &s;oever its coffers might be emptied, it might ea&s;ily repleni&s;h them by rai&s;ing money upon the &s;ecurities of tho&s;e to whom it had advanced its paper. Experience, I believe, &s;oon convinced them that this method of rai&s;ing money was by much too &s;low to an&s;wer their purpo&s;e; and that coffers which originally were &s;o ill filled, and which emptied them&s;elves &s;o very fa&s;t, could be repleni&s;hed by no other expedient but the ruinous one of drawing bills upon London, and when they became due, paying them by other draughts upon the &s;ame place with accumulated intere&s;t and commi&s;&s;ion. But though they had been able by this method to rai&s;e money as fa&s;t as they wanted it; yet in&s;tead of making a profit, they mu&s;t have &s;uffered a lo&s;s by every &s;uch operation; &s;o that in the long-run they mu&s;t have ruined them&s;elves as a mer|cantile company, though, perhaps, not &s;o &s;oon as by the more expen&s;ive practice of drawing and re-drawing. They could &s;till
<PB N="383" REF="395">
have made nothing by the intere&s;t of the paper, which, being over and above what the circulation of the country could ab&s;orb and employ, returned upon them, in order to be exchanged for gold and &s;ilver, as fa&s;t as they i&s;&s;ued it; and for the payment of which they were them&s;elves continually obliged to borrow money. On the contrary, the whole expence of this borrowing, of employing agents to look out for people who had money to lend, of nego|ciating with tho&s;e people, and of drawing the proper bond or a&s;&s;ign|ment, mu&s;t have fallen upon them, and have been &s;o much clear lo&s;s upon the balance of their accounts. The project of repleni&s;h|ing their coffers in this manner may be compared to that of a man who had a water-pond from which a &s;tream was continually running out, and into which no &s;tream was continually running, but who propo&s;ed to keep it always equally full by employing a number of people to go continually with buckets to a well at &s;ome miles di&s;tance in order to bring water to repleni&s;h it.</P>
<P>BUT though this operation had proved, not only practicable, but profitable to the bank as a mercantile company; yet the country could have derived no benefit from it; but, on the con|trary, mu&s;t have &s;uffered a very con&s;iderable lo&s;s by it. This ope|ration could not augment in the &s;malle&s;t degree the quantity of money to be lent. It could only have erected this bank into a &s;ort of general loan office for the whole country. Tho&s;e who wanted to borrow, mu&s;t have applied to this bank, in&s;tead of applying to the private per&s;ons who had lent it their money. But a bank which lends money, perhaps, to five hundred different people, the greater part of whom its directors can know very little about, is not likely to be more judicious in the choice of its debtors, than a private per&s;on who lends out his money among a few people whom he knows, and in who&s;e &s;ober and frugal conduct he thinks he has good rea&s;on to confide. The debtors of &s;uch a bank, as that who&s;e conduct I have been giving &s;ome
<PB N="384" REF="396">
account of, were likely, the greater part of them, to be chime|rical projectors, the drawers and re-drawers of circulating bills of exchange, who would employ the money in extravagant under|takings, which, with all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance that could be given them, they would probably never be able to complete, and which, if they &s;hould be compleated, would never repay the expence which they had really co&s;t, would never afford a fund capable of main|taining a quantity of labour equal to that which had been em|ployed about them. The &s;ober and frugal debtors of private per&s;ons, on the contrary, would be more likely to employ the money borrowed in &s;ober undertakings which were proportioned to their capitals, and which, though they might have le&s;s of the grand and the marvellous, would have more of the &s;olid and the profitable, which would repay with a large profit what|ever had been laid out upon them, and which would thus afford a fund capable of maintaining a much greater quantity of labour than that which had been employed about them. The &s;ucce&s;s of this operation, therefore, without encrea&s;ing in the &s;malle&s;t degree the capital of the country, would only have transferred a great part of it from prudent and profitable, to imprudent and unprofitable undertakings.</P>
<P>THAT the indu&s;try of Scotland langui&s;hed for want of money to employ it, was the opinion of the famous Mr. Law. By e&s;ta|bli&s;hing a bank of a particular kind, which, he &s;eems to have imagined, might i&s;&s;ue paper to the amount of the whole value of all the lands in the country, he propo&s;ed to remedy this want of money. The parliament of Scotland, when he fir&s;t propo&s;ed his project, did not think proper to adopt it. It was afterwards adopted, with &s;ome variations, by the duke of Orleans, at that time regent of France. The idea of the po&s;&s;ibility of multiplying paper money to almo&s;t any extent, was the real foundation of what is called the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi &s;cheme, the mo&s;t extravagant project both
<PB N="385" REF="397">
of banking and &s;tock-jobbing that, perhaps, the world ever &s;aw. The different operations of this &s;cheme are explained &s;o fully, &s;o clearly, and with &s;o much order and di&s;tinctne&s;s, by Mr. Du Verney, in his Examination of the Political Reflections upon Commerce and Finances of Mr. Du Tot, that I &s;hall not give any account of them. The principles upon which it was founded are explained by Mr. Law him&s;elf, in a di&s;cour&s;e concerning money and trade, which he publi&s;hed in Scotland when he fir&s;t propo&s;ed his project. The &s;plendid, but vi&s;ionary ideas which are &s;et forth in that and &s;ome other works upon the &s;ame principles, &s;till con|tinue to make an impre&s;&s;ion upon many people, and have, perhaps, in part, contributed to that exce&s;s of banking, which has of late been complained of both in Scotland and in other places.</P>
<P>THE bank of England is the greate&s;t bank of circulation in Europe. It was incorporated, in pur&s;uance of an act of parlia|ment, by a charter under the great &s;eal, dated the 27th July, 1694. It at that time advanced to government the &s;um of one million two hundred thou&s;and pounds, for an annuity of one hundred thou|&s;and pounds; or for 96,000 l. a year intere&s;t, at the rate of eight per cent., and 4000 l. a year for the expence of management. The credit of the new government, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the revolution, we may believe, mu&s;t have been very low, when it was obliged to borrow at &s;o high an intere&s;t.</P>
<P>IN 1697 the bank was allowed to enlarge its capital &s;tock by an engraftment of 1,001,171 l. 10 s. Its whole capital &s;tock, there|fore, amounted at this time to 2,201,171 l. 10 s. This engraft|ment is &s;aid to have been for the &s;upport of publick credit. In 1696 tallies had been at forty, and fifty, and &s;ixty per cent. di&s;count, and bank notes at twenty per cent. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James Po&s;tlethwaite's Hi&s;tory of the Publick Revenue, page 301.</NOTE>. During the great recoinage of the &s;ilver, which was going on at this time, the bank had thought proper to di&s;continue the payment of its notes, which nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ioned their di&s;credit.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="398">
IN pur&s;uance of the 7th Anne, c. vii. the bank advanced and paid into the exchequer, the &s;um of 400,000 l.; making in all the &s;um of 1,600,000 l. which it had advanced upon its original annuity of 96,000 l. intere&s;t and 4000 l. for expence of management. In 1708, therefore, the credit of government was as good as that of private per&s;ons, &s;ince it could borrow at &s;ix per cent. intere&s;t, the common legal and market rate of tho&s;e times. In pur&s;uance of the &s;ame act, the bank cancelled exchequer bills to the amount of 1,775,027 l. 17 s. 10&frac12;d. at &s;ix per cent. intere&s;t, and was at the &s;ame time allowed to take in &s;ub&s;criptions for doubling its capital. In 1708, therefore, the capital of the bank amounted to 4,402,343 l.; and it had advanced to government the &s;um of 3,375,027 l. 17 s. 10&frac12;d.</P>
<P>BY a call of fifteen per cent. in 1709, there was paid in and made &s;tock 656,204 l. 1 s. 9 d.; and by another of ten per cent. in 1710,501,448 l. 12 s. 11 d. In con&s;equence of tho&s;e two calls, therefore, the bank capital amounted to 5,559,995 l. 14 s. 8 d.</P>
<P>IN pur&s;uance of the 8th George I. c. xxi. the bank purcha&s;ed of the South Sea Company, &s;tock to the amount of 4,000,000 l.; and in 1722, in con&s;equence of the &s;ub&s;criptions which it had taken in for enabling it to make this purcha&s;e, its capital &s;tock was increa&s;ed by 3,400,000 l. At this time, therefore, the bank had advanced to the publick 9,375,027 l. 17 s. 10&frac12;d.; and its capital &s;tock amounted only to 8,959,995 l. 14 s. 8 d. It was upon this occa&s;ion that the &s;um which the bank had advanced to the publick, and for which it received intere&s;t, began fir&s;t to exceed its capital &s;tock, or the &s;um for which it paid a dividend to the proprietors of bank &s;tock; or, in other words, that the bank began to have an undi|vided capital, over and above its divided one. It has continued to have an undivided capital of the &s;ame kind ever &s;ince. In 1746 the bank had, upon different occa&s;ions, advanced to the pub|lick
<PB N="387" REF="399">
11,686,800 l. and its divided capital had been rai&s;ed by different calls and &s;ub&s;criptions to 10,780,000 l. The &s;tate of tho&s;e two &s;ums has continued to be the &s;ame ever &s;ince. In pur&s;uance of the 4th of George III. c. 25. the bank agreed to pay to government for the renewal of its charter, 110,000 l. without intere&s;t or repayment. This &s;um, therefore, did not increa&s;e either of tho&s;e two other &s;ums.</P>
<P>THE dividend of the bank has varied according to the variations in the rate of the intere&s;t which it has, at different times, received for the money it had advanced to the publick, as well as according to other circum&s;tances. This rate of intere&s;t has gradually been reduced from eight to three per cent. For &s;ome years pa&s;t the bank dividend has been at five and a half per cent.</P>
<P>THE &s;tability of the bank of England is equal to that of the Briti&s;h government. All that it has advanced to the publick mu&s;t be lo&s;t before its creditors can &s;u&s;tain any lo&s;s. No other banking company in England can be e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of parlia|ment, or can con&s;i&s;t of more than &s;ix members. It acts, not only as an ordinary bank, but as a great engine of &s;tate. It receives and pays the greater part of the annuities which are due to the creditors of the publick, it circulates exchequer bills, and it advances to government the annual amount of the land and malt taxes, which are frequently not paid up till &s;ome years thereafter. In tho&s;e dif|ferent operations, its duty to the publick may &s;ometimes have obliged it, without any fault of its directors, to over&s;tock the cir|culation with paper money. It likewi&s;e di&s;counts merchants bills, and has, upon &s;everal different occa&s;ions, &s;upported the credit of the principal hou&s;es, not only of England, but of Hamburgh and Holland. Upon one occa&s;ion it is &s;aid to have advanced for this pur|po&s;e, in one week, about 1,600,000 l.; a great part of it in bullion. I do not, however, pretend to warrant either the greatne&s;s of the &s;um, or the &s;hortne&s;s of the time. Upon other occa&s;ions, this great company has been reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of paying in &s;ixpences.</P>

IT is not by augmenting the capital of the country, but by rendering a greater part of that capital active and productive than would otherwi&s;e be &s;o, that the mo&s;t judicious operations of banking can increa&s;e the indu&s;try of the country. That part of his capital which a dealer is obliged to keep by him unem|ployed, and in ready money for an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands, is &s;o much dead &s;tock, which, &s;o long as it remains in this &s;itu|ation, produces nothing either to him or to his country. The judicious operations of banking, enable him to convert this dead &s;tock into active and productive &s;tock; into materials to work upon, into tools to work with, and into provi&s;ions and &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence to work for; into &s;tock which produces &s;omething both to him and to his country. The gold and &s;ilver money which circulates in any country, and by means of which, the produce of its land and labour is annually circulated and di&s;tributed to the proper con&s;umers, is, in the &s;ame manner as the ready money of the dealer, all dead &s;tock. It is a very valuable part of the capital of the country, which produces nothing to the country. The judicious operations of banking, by &s;ub&s;tituting paper in the room of a great part of this gold and &s;ilver, enables the country to convert a great part of this dead &s;tock into active and produc|tive &s;tock; into &s;tock which produces &s;omething to the country. The gold and &s;ilver money which circulates in any country may very properly be compared to a highway, which, while it circulates and carries to market all the gra&s;s and corn of the country, produces it&s;elf not a &s;ingle pile of either. The judi|cious operations of banking, by providing, if I may be allowed &s;o violent a metaphor, a &s;ort of waggon-way through the air; enable the country to convert, as it were, a great part of its highways into good pa&s;tures and corn fields, and thereby to in|crea&s;e very con&s;iderably the annual produce of its land and labour. The commerce and indu&s;try of the country, however, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, though they may be &s;omewhat augmented, cannot
<PB N="389" REF="401">
be altogether &s;o &s;ecure, when they are thus, as it were, &s;u&s;pended upon the Daedalian wings of paper money, as when they travel about upon the &s;olid ground of gold and &s;ilver. Over and above the accidents to which they are expo&s;ed from the un&s;kilfulne&s;s of the conductors of this paper money, they are liable to &s;everal others, from which no prudence or &s;kill of tho&s;e conductors can guard them.</P>
<P>AN un&s;ucce&s;sful war, for example, in which the enemy got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the capital, and con&s;equently of that trea&s;ure which &s;upported the credit of the paper money, would occa&s;ion a much greater confu&s;ion in a country where the whole circulation was carried on by paper, than in one where the greater part of it was carried on by gold and &s;ilver. The u&s;ual in&s;trument of commerce having lo&s;t its value, no exchanges could be made but either by barter or upon credit. All taxes having been u&s;ually paid in paper money, the prince would not have wherewithal either to pay his troops, or to furni&s;h his magazines; and the &s;tate of the country would be much more irretrievable than if the greater part of its circulation had con&s;i&s;ted in gold and &s;ilver. A prince, anxious to maintain his dominions at all times in the &s;tate in which he can mo&s;t ea&s;ily defend them, ought, upon this account, to guard, not only again&s;t that exce&s;&s;ive multiplication of paper money which ruins the very banks which i&s;&s;ue it; but even againt that multi|plication of it, which enables them to fill the greater part of the circulation of the country with it.</P>
<P>THE circulation of every country may be con&s;idered as divided into two different branches; the circulation of the dealers with one another, and the circulation between the dealers and the con&s;umers. Though the &s;ame pieces of money, whether paper or metal, may be employed &s;ometimes in the one circulation and &s;ometimes in the other, yet as both are con&s;tantly going on at the &s;ame time, each
<PB N="390" REF="402">
requires a certain &s;tock of money of one kind or another, to carry it on. The value of the goods circulated between the different dealers, never can exceed the value of tho&s;e circulated between the dealers and the con&s;umers; whatever is bought by the dealers, being ultimately de&s;tined to be &s;old to the con&s;umers. The circu|lation between the dealers, as it is carried on by whole&s;ale, requires generally a pretty large &s;um for every particular tran&s;action. That between the dealers and the con&s;umers, on the contrary, as it is generally carried on by retail, frequently requires but very &s;mall ones, a &s;hilling, or even a halfpenny, being often &s;ufficient. But &s;mall &s;ums circulate much fa&s;ter than large ones. A Shilling changes ma&s;ters more frequently than a guinea, and a halfpenny more frequently than a &s;hilling. Though the annual purcha&s;es of all the con&s;umers, therefore, are at lea&s;t equal in value to tho&s;e of all the dealers, they can generally be tran&s;acted with a much &s;maller quantity of money; the &s;ame pieces, by a more rapid circulation, &s;erving as the in&s;trument of many more purcha&s;es of the one kind than of the other.</P>
<P>PAPER money may be &s;o regulated, as either to confine it&s;elf very much to the circulation between the different dealers, or to extend it&s;elf likewi&s;e to a great part of that between the dealers and the con&s;umers. Where no bank notes are circulated under ten pounds value, as in London, paper money confines it&s;elf very much to the circulation between the dealers. When a ten pound bank note comes into the hands of a con&s;umer, he is generally obliged to change it at the fir&s;t &s;hop where he has occa&s;ion to purcha&s;e five &s;hillings worth of goods, &s;o that it often returns into the hands of a dealer, before the con&s;umer has &s;pent the fortieth part of the money. Where bank notes are i&s;&s;ued for &s;o &s;mall &s;ums as twenty &s;hillings, as in Scotland, paper money extends it&s;elf to a con&s;iderable part of the circulation between dealers and con&s;umers. Before the act of parliament, which put a &s;top to the circulation of ten and
<PB N="391" REF="403">
five &s;hilling notes, it filled a &s;till greater part of that circulation. In the currencies of North America, paper was commonly i&s;&s;ued for &s;o &s;mall a &s;um as a &s;hilling, and filled almo&s;t the whole of that circulation, In &s;ome paper currencies of York&s;hire, it was i&s;&s;ued even for &s;o &s;mall a &s;um as a &s;ixpence.</P>
<P>WHERE the i&s;&s;uing of bank notes for &s;uch very &s;mall &s;ums is allowed and commonly practi&s;ed, many mean people are both enabled and encouraged to become bankers. A per&s;on who&s;e pro|mi&s;&s;ory note for five pounds, or even for twenty &s;hillings, would be rejected by every body, will get it to be received without &s;cruple when it is i&s;&s;ued for &s;o &s;mall a &s;um as a &s;ixpence. But the frequent bankruptcies to which &s;uch beggarly bankers mu&s;t be liable, may occa&s;ion a very con&s;iderable inconveniency, and &s;ometimes even a very great calamity to many poor people who had received their notes in payment.</P>
<P>IT were better, perhaps, that no bank notes were i&s;&s;ued in any part of the kingdom for a &s;maller &s;um than five pounds. Paper money would then, probably, confine it&s;elf, in every part of the kingdom, to the circulation between the different dealers, as much as it does at pre&s;ent in London, where no bank notes are i&s;&s;ued under ten pounds value; five pounds being, in mo&s;t parts of the kingdom, a &s;um which, though it will purcha&s;e, perhaps, little more than half the quantity of goods, is as much con&s;idered, and is as &s;eldom &s;pent all at once, as ten pounds are amid&s;t the profu&s;e expence of London.</P>
<P>WHERE paper money, it is to be ob&s;erved, is pretty much con|fined to the circulation between dealers and dealers, as at London, there is always plenty of gold and &s;ilver. Where it extends it&s;elf to a con&s;iderable part of the circulation between dealers and con&s;umers,
<PB N="392" REF="404">
as in Scotland, and &s;till more in North America, it bani&s;hes gold and &s;ilver almo&s;t entirely from the country; almo&s;t all the ordinary tran&s;actions of its interior commerce being thus carried on by paper. The &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of ten and five &s;hilling bank notes, &s;ome|what relieved the &s;carcity of gold and &s;ilver in Scotland; and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of twenty &s;hilling notes, would probably relieve it &s;till more. Tho&s;e metals are &s;aid to have become more abundant in America, &s;ince the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of their paper currencies. They are &s;aid, likewi&s;e, to have been more abundant before the in&s;titution of tho&s;e currencies.</P>
<P>THOUGH paper money &s;hould be pretty much confined to the circulation between dealers and dealers, yet banks and bankers might &s;till be able to give nearly the &s;ame a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the indu&s;try and commerce of the country, as they had done when paper money filled almo&s;t the whole circulation. The ready money which a dealer is obliged to keep by him, for an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands, is de&s;tined altogether for the circulation between him&s;elf and other dealers, of whom he buys goods. He has no occa&s;ion to keep any by him for the circulation between him&s;elf and the con&s;umers, who are his cu&s;tomers, and who bring ready money to him, in&s;tead of taking any from him. Though no paper money, therefore, was allowed to be i&s;&s;ued, but for &s;uch &s;ums as would confine it pretty much to the circulation between dealers and dealers; yet partly by di&s;counting real bills of exchange, and partly by lending upon ca&s;h accounts, banks and bankers might &s;till be able to relieve the greater part of tho&s;e dealers from the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping any con&s;iderable part of their &s;tock by them, unemployed and in ready money, for an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands. They might &s;till be able to give the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance which banks and bankers can, with propriety, give to traders of every kind.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="405">
TO re&s;train private people, it may be &s;aid, from receiving in payment the promi&s;&s;ary notes of a banker, for any &s;um whether great or &s;mall, when they them&s;elves are willing to receive them; or, to re&s;train a banker from i&s;&s;uing &s;uch notes, when all his neighbours are willing to accept of them, is a manife&s;t violation of that natural liberty which it is the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of law, not to infringe, but to &s;upport. Such regulations may, no doubt, be con&s;idered as in &s;ome re&s;pect a violation of natural liberty. But tho&s;e exertions of the natural liberty of a few individuals, which might endanger the &s;ecurity of the whole &s;ociety, are, and ought to be, re&s;trained by the laws of all governments; of the mo&s;t free, as well as of the mo&s;t de&s;potical. The obligation of building party walls, in order to prevent the communication of fire, is a violation of natural liberty, exactly of the &s;ame kind with the regulations of the banking trade which are here propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>A PAPER money con&s;i&s;ting in bank notes, i&s;&s;ued by people of undoubted credit, payable upon demand without any condition, and in fact always readily paid as &s;oon as pre&s;ented, is, in every re&s;pect, equal in value to gold and &s;ilver money; &s;ince gold and &s;ilver money can at any time be had for it. Whatever is either bought or &s;old for &s;uch paper, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be bought or &s;old as cheap as it could have been for gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P>THE increa&s;e of paper money, it has been &s;aid, by augmenting the quantity, and con&s;equently dimini&s;hing the value of the whole currency, nece&s;&s;arily augments the money price of commodities. But as the quantity of gold and &s;ilver, which is taken from the currency, is always equal to the quantity of paper which is added to it, paper money does not nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e the quantity of the whole currency. From the beginning of the la&s;t century to the pre&s;ent times, provi&s;ions never were cheaper in Scotland than in
<PB N="394" REF="406">
1759, though, from the circulation of ten and five &s;hilling bank notes, there was then more paper money in the country than at pre&s;ent. The proportion between the price of provi&s;ions in Scot|land and that in England, is the &s;ame now as before the great multiplication of banking companies in Scotland. Corn is, upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions, fully as cheap in England as in France; though there is a great deal of paper money in England, and &s;carce any in France. In 1751 and in 1752, when Mr. Hume publi&s;hed his Political di&s;cour&s;es, and &s;oon after the great multiplication of paper money in Scotland, there was a very &s;en&s;ible ri&s;e in the price of provi&s;ions, owing, probably, to the badne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;ons, and not to the multiplication of paper money.</P>
<P>IT would be otherwi&s;e, indeed, with a paper money con&s;i&s;ting in promi&s;&s;ary notes, of which the immediate payment depended, in any re&s;pect, either upon the good will of tho&s;e who i&s;&s;ued them; or upon a condition which the holder of the notes might not always have it in his power to fulfil; or of which the payment was not exigible till after a certain number of years, and which in the mean|time bore no intere&s;t. Such a paper money would, no doubt, fall more or le&s;s below the value of gold and &s;ilver, according as the difficulty or uncertainty of obtaining immediate payment was &s;uppo&s;ed to be greater or le&s;s; or according to the greater or le&s;s di&s;tance of time at which payment was exigible.</P>
<P>SOME years ago the different banking companies of Scotland were in the practice of in&s;erting into their bank notes, what they called an Optional Clau&s;e, by which they promi&s;ed payment to the bearer, either as &s;oon as the note &s;hould be pre&s;ented, or, in the option of the directors, &s;ix months after &s;uch pre&s;entment, together with the legal intere&s;t for the &s;aid &s;ix months. The directors of &s;ome of tho&s;e banks &s;ometimes took advantage of this optional
<PB N="395" REF="407">
clau&s;e, and &s;ometimes threatened tho&s;e who demanded gold and &s;ilver in exchange for a con&s;iderable number of their notes, that they would take advantage of it, unle&s;s &s;uch demanders would content them&s;elves with a part of what they demanded. The promi&s;&s;ary notes of tho&s;e banking companies con&s;tituted at that time the far greater part of the currency of Scotland, which this uncertainty of payment nece&s;&s;arily degraded below the value of gold and &s;ilver money. During the continuance of this abu&s;e, (which prevailed chiefly in 1762, 1763, and 1764), while the ex|change between London and Carli&s;le was at par, that between London and Dumfries would &s;ometimes be four per cent. again&s;t Dumfries, though this town is not thirty miles di&s;tant from Carli&s;le. But at Carli&s;le, bills were paid in gold and &s;ilver; whereas at Dumfries they were paid in Scotch bank notes, and the uncer|tainty of getting tho&s;e bank notes exchanged for gold and &s;ilver coin had thus degraded them four per cent. below the value of that coin. The &s;ame act of parliament which &s;uppre&s;&s;ed ten and five &s;hilling bank notes, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed likewi&s;e this optional clau&s;e, and thereby re&s;tored the exchange between England and Scotland to its natural rate, or to what the cour&s;e of trade and remittances might happen to make it.</P>
<P>IN the paper currencies of York&s;hire, the payment of &s;o &s;mall a &s;um as a &s;ixpence &s;ometimes depended upon the condition that the holder of the note &s;hould bring the change of a guinea to the per&s;on who i&s;&s;ued it; a condition, which the holders of &s;uch notes might frequently find it very difficult to fulfil, and which mu&s;t have degraded this currency below the value of gold and &s;ilver money. An act of parliament, accordingly, declared all &s;uch clau&s;es unlawful, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, in the &s;ame manner as in Scotland, all promi&s;&s;ary notes, payable to the bearer, under twenty &s;hillings value.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="408">
THE paper currencies of North America con&s;i&s;ted, not in bank notes payable to the bearer on demand, but in a government paper, of which the payment was not exigible till &s;everal years after it was i&s;&s;ued: And though the colony governments paid no intere&s;t to the holders of this paper, they declared it to be, and in fact rendered it, a legal tender of payment for the full value for which it was i&s;&s;ued. But allowing the colony &s;ecurity to be perfectly good, a hundred pounds payable fifteen years hence, for example, in a country where intere&s;t is at &s;ix per cent. is worth little more than forty pounds ready money. To oblige a creditor, therefore, to accept of this as full payment for a debt of a hundred pounds actually paid down in ready money, was an act of &s;uch violent inju&s;tice, as has &s;carce, perhaps, been attempted by the government of any other country which pretended to be free. It bears the evident marks of having originally been, what the hone&s;t and downright Doctor Dougla&s;s a&s;&s;ures us it was, a &s;cheme of fraudulent debtors to cheat their creditors. The government of Pen&s;ylvania, indeed, pretended, upon their fir&s;t emi&s;&s;ion of paper money in 1722, to render their paper of equal value with gold and &s;ilver, by enacting penalties again&s;t all tho&s;e who made any difference in the price of their goods when they &s;old them for a colony paper, and when they &s;old them for gold and &s;ilver; a regulation equally tyrannical, but much le&s;s effectual than that which it was meant to &s;upport. A po&s;itive law may render a &s;hilling a legal tender for a guinea; becau&s;e it may direct the courts of ju&s;tice to di&s;charge the debtor who has made that tender. But no po&s;itive law can oblige a per&s;on who &s;ells goods, and who is at liberty to &s;ell or not to &s;ell, as he plea&s;es, to accept of a &s;hilling as equivalent to a guinea in the price of them. Not|with&s;tanding any regulation of this kind, it appeared by the cour&s;e of exchange with Great Britain, that a hundred pounds &s;terling was occa&s;ionally con&s;idered as equivalent, in &s;ome of the colonies, to a hundred and thirty pounds, and in others to &s;o great a &s;um as
<PB N="397" REF="409">
eleven hundred pounds currency; this difference in the value ari&s;ing from the difference in the quantity of paper emitted in the different colonies, and in the di&s;tance and probability of the term of its final di&s;charge and redemption.</P>
<P>NO law, therefore, could be more equitable than the act of par|liament, &s;o unju&s;tly complained of in the colonies, which declared that no paper currency to be emitted there in time coming, &s;hould be a legal tender of payment.</P>
<P>PENSYLVANIA was always more moderate in its emi&s;&s;ions of paper money than any other of our colonies. Its paper currency accordingly is &s;aid never to have &s;unk below the value of the gold and &s;ilver which was current in the colony before the fir&s;t emi&s;&s;ion of its paper money. Before that emi&s;&s;ion, the colony had rai&s;ed the de|nomination of its coin, and had, by act of a&s;&s;embly, ordered five &s;hillings &s;terling to pa&s;s in the colony for &s;ix and three-pence, and afterwards for &s;ix and eight-pence. A pound colony currency, therefore, even when that currency was gold and &s;ilver, was more than thirty per cent. below the value of a pound &s;terling; and when that currency was turned into paper, it was &s;eldom much more than thirty per cent. below that value. The pretence for rai&s;ing the denomination of the coin, was to prevent the exportation of gold and &s;ilver, by making equal quantities of tho&s;e metals pa&s;s for greater &s;ums in the colony than they did in the mother country. It was found, however, that the price of all goods from the mother country ro&s;e exactly in proportion as they rai&s;ed the denomination of their coin, &s;o that their gold and &s;ilver were exported as fa&s;t as ever.</P>
<P>THE paper of each colony being received in the payment of the provincial taxes, for the full value for which it had been i&s;&s;ued,
<PB N="398" REF="410">
it nece&s;&s;arily derived from this u&s;e &s;ome additional value, over and above what it would have had, from the real or &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;tance of the term of its final di&s;charge and redemption. This additional value was greater or le&s;s, according as the quantity of paper i&s;&s;ued was more or le&s;s above what could be employed in the payment of the taxes of the particular colony which i&s;&s;ued it. It was in all the colonies very much above what could be employed in this manner.</P>
<P>A PRINCE, who &s;hould enact that a certain proportion of his taxes &s;hould be paid in a paper money of a certain kind, might thereby give a certain value to this paper money; even though the term of its final di&s;charge and redemption &s;hould depend altogether upon the will of the prince. If the bank which i&s;&s;ued this paper was careful to keep the quantity of it always &s;omewhat below what could ea&s;ily be employed in this manner, the demand for it might be &s;uch as to make it even bear a premium, or &s;ell for &s;omewhat more in the market than the quantity of gold or &s;ilver currency for which it was i&s;&s;ued. Some people account in this manner for what is called the Agio of the bank of Am&s;terdam, or for the &s;uperiority of bank money over current money; though this bank money, as they pretend, cannot be taken out of the bank at the will of the owner. The greater part of foreign bills of exchange mu&s;t be paid in bank money, that is, by a transfer in the books of the bank; and the directors of the bank, they alledge, are careful to keep the whole quantity of bank money always below what this u&s;e occa&s;ions a demand for. It is upon this account, they &s;ay, that bank money &s;ells for a premium, or bears an agio of four or five per cent. above the &s;ame nominal &s;um of the gold and &s;ilver currency of the country. This account of the bank of Am&s;terdam, however, I have rea&s;on to believe, is altogether chimerical.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="411">
A PAPER currency which falls below the value of gold and &s;ilver coin, does not thereby &s;ink the value of gold and &s;ilver, or occa&s;ion equal quantities of tho&s;e metals to exchange for a &s;maller quantity of goods of any other kind. The propor|tion between the value of gold and &s;ilver and that of goods of any other kind, depends in all ca&s;es, not upon the nature or quantity of any particular paper money, which may be current in any particular country, but upon the richne&s;s or poverty of the mines, which happen at any particular time to &s;upply the great market of the commercial world with tho&s;e metals. It depends upon the proportion between the quantity of labour which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to bring a certain quantity of gold and &s;ilver to market, and that which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to bring thither a certain quantity of any other &s;ort of goods.</P>
<P>IF bankers are re&s;trained from i&s;&s;uing any circulating bank notes, or notes payable to the bearer, for le&s;s than a certain &s;um; and if they are &s;ubjected to the obligation of an im|mediate and unconditional payment of &s;uch bank notes as &s;oon as pre&s;ented, their trade may, with &s;afety to the publick, be rendered in all other re&s;pects perfectly free. The late multiplication of banking companies in both parts of the united kingdom, an event by which many people have been much alarmed, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, increa&s;es the &s;ecurity of the publick. It obliges all of them to be more circum|&s;pect in their conduct, and, by not extending their currency beyond its due proportion to their ca&s;h, to guard them&s;elves again&s;t tho&s;e malicious runs, which the rival&s;hip of &s;o many competitors is always ready to bring upon them. It re&s;trains the circulation of each particular company within a narrower circle, and reduces their circulating notes to a &s;maller number.
<PB N="400" REF="412">
By dividing the whole circulation into a greater number of parts, the failure of any one company, an accident which, in the cour&s;e of things, mu&s;t &s;ometimes happen, becomes of le&s;s con&s;equence to the publick. This free competition too obliges all bankers to be more liberal in their dealings with their cu&s;tomers, le&s;t their rivals &s;hould carry them away. In general, if any branch of trade, or any divi&s;ion of labour, be advantageous to the publick, the freer and more general the competition, it will always be the more &s;o.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Of the Accumulation of Capital, or of productive and unpro|ductive Labour.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE is one &s;ort of labour which adds to the value of the &s;ubject upon which it is be&s;towed: There is another which has no &s;uch effect. The former, as it produces a value, may be called productive; the latter unproductive <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some French authors of great learning and ingenuity have u&s;ed tho&s;e words in a different &s;en&s;e. In the la&s;t chapter of the fourth book, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how that their &s;en&s;e is an improper one.</NOTE> labour. Thus the labour of a manufacturer adds generally to the value of the materials which he works upon, that of his own maintenance, and of his ma&s;ter's profit. The labour of a menial &s;ervant, on the contrary, adds to the value of nothing. Though the manufacturer has his wages advanced to him by his ma&s;ter, he, in reality, co&s;ts him no expence, the value of tho&s;e wages being generally re&s;tored, together with a profit, in the improved value of the &s;ubject upon which his labour is be&s;towed. But the maintenance of a menial &s;ervant never is re&s;tored. A man grows rich by employing a multitude of ma|nufacturers: He grows poor, by maintaining a multitude of menial &s;ervants. The labour of the latter, however, has its value,
<PB N="401" REF="413">
and de&s;erves its reward as well as that of the former. But the labour of the manufacturer fixes and realizes it&s;elf in &s;ome particular &s;ubject or vendible commodity, which la&s;ts for &s;ome time at lea&s;t after that labour is pa&s;t. It is, as it were, a certain quantity of labour &s;tocked and &s;tored up to be employed, if nece&s;&s;ary, upon &s;ome other occa&s;ion. That &s;ubject, or what is the &s;ame thing, the price of that &s;ubject, can afterwards, if nece&s;&s;ary, put into motion a quan|tity of labour equal to that which had originally produced it. The labour of the menial &s;ervant, on the contrary, does not fix or realize it&s;elf in any particular &s;ubject or vendible commodity. His &s;ervices generally peri&s;h in the very in&s;tant of their performance, and &s;eldom leave any trace or value behind them, for which an equal quantity of &s;ervice could afterwards be procured.</P>
<P>THE labour of &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable orders in the &s;ociety is, like that of menial &s;ervants, unproductive of any value, and does not fix or realize it&s;elf in any permanent &s;ubject, or vendible commodity, which endures after that labour is pa&s;t, and for which an equal quantity of labour could afterwards be procured. The &s;overeign, for example, with all the officers both of ju&s;tice and war who &s;erve under him, the whole army and navy, are unproductive labourers. They are the &s;ervants of the publick, and are maintained by a part of the annual produce of the indu&s;try of other people. Their &s;ervice, how honourable, how u&s;eful, or how nece&s;&s;ary &s;oever, produces nothing for which an equal quantity of &s;ervice can afterwards be procured. The protection, &s;ecurity, and defence of the commonwealth, the effect of their labour this year, will not purcha&s;e its protection, &s;ecurity, and defence, for the year to come. In the &s;ame cla&s;s mu&s;t be ranked, &s;ome both of the grave&s;t and mo&s;t important, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t frivolous profe&s;&s;ions: churchmen, lawyers, phy&s;icians, men of letters of all kinds; players, buffoons, mu&s;icians, opera|&s;ingers,
<PB N="402" REF="414">
opera-dancers, &amp;c. The labour of the meane&s;t of the&s;e has a certain value, regulated by the very &s;ame principles which regulate that of every other &s;ort of labour; and that of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful, produces nothing which could afterwards pur|cha&s;e or procure an equal quantity of labour. Like the decla|mation of the actor, the harangue of the orator, or the tune of the mu&s;ician, the work of all of them peri&s;hes in the very in&s;tant of its production.</P>
<P>BOTH productive and unproductive labourers, and tho&s;e who do not labour at all, are all equally maintained by the annual pro|duce of the land and labour of the country. This produce, how great &s;oever, can never be infinite, but mu&s;t have certain limits. According, therefore, as a &s;maller or greater proportion of it is in any one year employed in maintaining unproductive hands, the more in the one ca&s;e and the le&s;s in the other will remain for the productive, and the next year's produce will be greater or &s;maller accordingly; the whole annual produce, if we except the &s;ponta|neous productions of the earth, being the effect of productive la|bour.</P>
<P>THOUGH the whole annual produce of the land and labour of every country, is, no doubt, ultimately de&s;tined for &s;upplying the con&s;umption of its inhabitants, and for procuring a revenue to them; yet when it fir&s;t comes either from the ground, or from the hands of the productive labourers, it naturally divides it&s;elf into two parts. One of them, and frequently the large&s;t, is, in the fir&s;t place, de&s;tined for replacing a capital, or for renewing the pro|vi&s;ions, materials, and fini&s;hed work, which had been withdrawn from a capital; the other for con&s;tituting a revenue either to the owner of this capital, as the profit of his &s;tock; or to &s;ome other per&s;on, as the rent of his land. Thus, of the produce of land,
<PB N="403" REF="415">
one part replaces the capital of the farmer; the other pays his profit and the rent of the landlord; and thus con&s;titutes a revenue both to the owner of this capital, as the profits of his &s;tock; and to &s;ome other per&s;on, as the rent of his land. Of the produce of a great manufacture, in the &s;ame manner, one part, and that always the large&s;t, replaces the capital of the undertaker of the work; the other pays his profit, and thus con&s;titutes a revenue to the owner of this capital.</P>
<P>THAT part of the annual produce of the land and labour of any country which replaces a capital, never is immediately employed to maintain any but productive hands. It pays the wages of pro|ductive labour only. That which is immediately de&s;tined for con|&s;tituting a revenue either as profit or as rent, may maintain in|differently either productive or unproductive hands.</P>
<P>WHATEVER part of his &s;tock a man employs as a capital, he always expects is to be replaced to him with a profit. He employs it, therefore, in maintaining productive hands only; and after having &s;erved in the function of a capital to him, it con&s;titutes a revenue to them. Whenever he employs any part of it in main|taining unproductive hands of any kind, that part is, from that moment, withdrawn from his capital, and placed in his &s;tock re|&s;erved for immediate con&s;umption.</P>
<P>UNPRODUCTIVE labourers, and tho&s;e who do not labour at all, are all maintained by revenue; either, fir&s;t, by that part of the annual produce which is originally de&s;tined for con&s;tituting a re|venue to &s;ome particular per&s;ons, either as the rent of land or as the profits of &s;tock; or, &s;econdly, by that part which, though originally de&s;tined for replacing a capital and for maintaining pro|ductive labourers only, yet when it comes into their hands, what|ever
<PB N="404" REF="416">
part of it is over and above their nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, may be employed in maintaining indifferently either productive or un|productive hands. Thus, not only the great landlord or the rich merchant, but even the common workman, if his wages are con|&s;iderable, may maintain a menial &s;ervant; or he may &s;ometimes go to a play or a puppet-&s;how, and &s;o contribute his &s;hare towards maintaining one &s;et of unproductive labourers; or he may pay &s;ome taxes, and thus help to maintain another &s;et, more honour|able and u&s;eful, indeed, but equally unproductive. No part of the annual produce, however, which had been originally de&s;tined to replace a capital, is ever directed towards maintaining unpro|ductive hands, till after it has put into motion its full comple|ment of productive labour, or all that it could put into motion in the way in which it was employed. The workman mu&s;t have earned his wages by work done, before he can employ any part of them in this manner. That part too is generally but a &s;mall one. It is his &s;pare revenue only, of which productive labourers have &s;eldom a great deal. They generally have &s;ome, however; and in the payment of taxes the greatne&s;s of their number may com|pen&s;ate, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the &s;mallne&s;s of their contribution. The rent of land and the profits of &s;tock are every where, there|fore, the principal &s;ources from which unproductive hands derive their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The&s;e are the two &s;orts of revenue of which the owners have generally mo&s;t to &s;pare. They might both maintain indifferently either productive or unproductive hands. They &s;eem, however, to have &s;ome predilection for the latter. The expence of a great lord feeds generally more idle than indu&s;trious people. The rich merchant, though with his capital he maintains indu|&s;trious people only, yet by his expence, that is, by the employ|ment of his revenue, he feeds commonly the very &s;ame &s;ort as the great lord.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="417">
THE proportion, therefore, between the productive and unpro|ductive hands, depends very much in every country upon the pro|portion between that part of the annual produce, which, as &s;oon as it comes either from the ground or from the hands of the pro|ductive labourers, is de&s;tined for replacing a capital, and that which is de&s;tined for con&s;tituting a revenue, either as rent, or as profit. This proportion is very different in rich from what it is in poor countries.</P>
<P>THUS, at pre&s;ent, in the opulent countries of Europe, a very large, frequently the large&s;t portion of the produce of the land, is de&s;tined for replacing the capital of the rich and independant farmer; the other for paying his profits, and the rent of the landlord. But antiently, during the prevalency of the feudal government, a very &s;mall portion of the produce was &s;ufficient to replace the capital employed in cul|tivation. It con&s;i&s;ted commonly in a few wretched cattle, main|tained altogether by the &s;pontaneous produce of uncultivated land, and which might, therefore, be con&s;idered as a part of that &s;ponta|neous produce. It generally too belonged to the landlord, and was by him advanced to the occupiers of the land. All the re&s;t of the produce properly belonged to him too, either as rent for his land, or as profit upon this paultry capital. The occupiers of land were generally bondmen, who&s;e per&s;ons and effects were equally his pro|perty. Tho&s;e who were not bondmen were tenants at will, and though the rent which they paid was often nominally little more than a quit-rent, it really amounted to the whole produce of the land. Their lord could at all times command their labour in peace, and their &s;ervice in war. Though they lived at a di&s;tance from his hou&s;e, they were equally dependant upon him as his re|tainers who lived in it. But the whole produce of the land un|doubtedly belongs to him, who can di&s;po&s;e of the labour and &s;er|vice of all tho&s;e whom it maintains. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Europe,
<PB N="406" REF="418">
the &s;hare of the landlord &s;eldom exceeds a third, &s;ometimes not a fourth part of the whole produce of the land. The rent of land, however, in all the improved parts of the country, has been tripled and quadrupled &s;ince tho&s;e antient times; and this third or fourth part of the annual produce is, it &s;eems, three or four times greater than the whole had been before. In the progre&s;s of improvement, rent, though it increa&s;es in proportion to the extent, dimini&s;hes in proportion to the produce of the land.</P>
<P>IN the opulent countries of Europe, great capitals are at pre&s;ent employed in trade and manufactures. In the ancient &s;tate, the little trade that was &s;tirring, and the few homely and coar&s;e manufactures that were carried on, required but very &s;mall ca|pitals. The&s;e, however, mu&s;t have yielded very large profits. The rate of intere&s;t was no where le&s;s than ten per cent. and their profits mu&s;t have been &s;ufficient to afford this great intere&s;t. At pre&s;ent the rate of intere&s;t, in the improved parts of Europe, is no where higher than &s;ix per cent. and in &s;ome of the mo&s;t im|proved it is &s;o low as four, three, and two per cent. Though that part of the revenue of the inhabitants which is derived from the profits of &s;tock is always much greater in rich than in poor coun|tries, it is becau&s;e the &s;tock is much greater: in proportion to the &s;tock the profits are generally much le&s;s.</P>
<P>THAT part of the annual produce, therefore, which, as &s;oon as it comes either from the ground or from the hands of the pro|ductive labourers, is de&s;tined for replacing a capital, is not only much greater in rich than in poor countries, but bears a much greater proportion to that which is immediately de&s;tined for con|&s;tituting a revenue either as rent or as profit. The funds de&s;tined for the maintenance of productive labour, are not only much greater in the former than in the latter, but bear a much greater
<PB N="407" REF="419">
proportion to tho&s;e which, though they may be employed to main|tain either productive or unproductive hands, have generally a predilection for the latter.</P>
<P>THE proportion between tho&s;e different funds nece&s;&s;arily deter|mines in every country the general character of the inhabitants as to indu&s;try or idlene&s;s. We are more indu&s;trious than our fore|fathers; becau&s;e in the pre&s;ent times the funds de&s;tined for the maintenance of indu&s;try, are much greater in proportion to tho&s;e which are likely to be employed in the maintenance of idlene&s;s, than they were two or three centuries ago. Our an|ce&s;tors were idle for want of a &s;ufficient encouragement to in|du&s;try. It is better, &s;ays the proverb, to play for nothing, than to work for nothing. In mercantile and manufacturing towns, where the inferior ranks of people are chiefly maintained by the employ|ment of capital, they are in general indu&s;trious, &s;ober, and thriv|ing; as in many Engli&s;h, and in mo&s;t Dutch towns. In tho&s;e towns which are principally &s;upported by the con&s;tant or occa&s;ional re&s;idence of a court, and in which the inferior ranks of people are chiefly maintained by the &s;pending of revenue, they are in general idle, di&s;&s;olute, and poor; as at Rome, Ver&s;ailles, Compiegne, and Fontainbleau. If you except Rouen and Bourdeaux, there is little trade or indu&s;try in any of the parliament towns of France; and the inferior ranks of people being chiefly maintained by the expence of the members of the courts of ju&s;tice, and of tho&s;e who come to plead before them, are in general idle and poor. The great trade of Rouen and Bourdeaux &s;eems to be altogether the effect of their &s;ituation. Rouen is nece&s;&s;arily the entrep&ocirc;t of al|mo&s;t all the goods which are brought either from foreign coun|tries, or from the maritime provinces of France, for the con&s;ump|tion of the great city of Paris. Bourdeaux is in the &s;ame manner the entrep&ocirc;t of the wines which grow upon the banks of the Ga|ronne, and of the rivers which run into it, one of the riche&s;t wine
<PB N="408" REF="420">
countries in the world, and which &s;eems to produce the wine fitte&s;t for exportation, or be&s;t &s;uited to the ta&s;te of foreign nations. Such advantageous &s;ituations nece&s;&s;arily attract a great capital by the great employment which they afford it; and the employment of this capital is the cau&s;e of the indu&s;try of tho&s;e two cities. In the other parliament towns of France, very little more capital &s;eems to be employed than what is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upplying their own con&s;umption; that is, little more than the &s;malle&s;t capital which can be employed in them. The &s;ame thing may be &s;aid of Paris, Madrid, and Vienna. Of tho&s;e three cities, Paris is by far the mo&s;t indu&s;trious; but Paris it&s;elf is the principal market of all the manufactures e&s;tabli&s;hed at Paris, and its own con&s;umption is the principal object of all the trade which it carries on. London, Li&s;bon, and Copenhagen, are, perhaps, the only three cities in Europe, which are both the con&s;tant re&s;idence of a court, and can at the &s;ame time be con&s;idered as trading cities, or as cities which trade not only for their own con&s;umption, but for that of other cities and countries. The &s;ituation of all the three is extremely advantageous, and naturally fits them to be the entrep&ocirc;ts of a great part of the goods de&s;tined for the con&s;umption of di&s;tant places. In a city where a great revenue is &s;pent, to employ with advantage a capital for any other purpo&s;e than for &s;upplying the con&s;umption of that city, is probably more difficult than in one in which the inferior ranks of people have no other maintenance but what they derive from the employment of &s;uch a capital. The idlene&s;s of the greater part of the people who are maintained by the expence of revenue, corrupts, it is probable, the indu&s;try of tho&s;e who ought to be maintained by the employment of capital, and renders it le&s;s advantageous to employ a capital there than in other places. There was little trade or indu&s;try in Edinburgh before the union. When the Scotch parliament was no longer to be a&s;&s;embled in it, when it cea&s;ed to be the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;idence of the principal nobility
<PB N="409" REF="421">
and gentry of Scotland, it became a city of &s;ome trade and indu&s;try. It &s;till continues, however, to be the re&s;idence of the principal courts of ju&s;tice in Scotland, of the boards of cu&s;toms and exci&s;e, &amp;c. A con&s;iderable revenue, therefore, &s;till continues to be &s;pent in it. In trade and indu&s;try it is much inferior to Gla&s;gow, of which the inhabitants are chiefly maintained by the employment of capital. The inhabitants of a large village, it has &s;ometimes been ob&s;erved, after having made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in manufactures, have become idle and poor, in con&s;equence of a great lord's having taken up his re&s;idence in their neighbourhood.</P>
<P>THE proportion between capital and revenue, therefore, &s;eems every where to regulate the proportion between indu&s;try and idlene&s;s. Wherever capital predominates, indu&s;try prevails: Where|ever revenue, idlene&s;s. Every increa&s;e or diminution of capital, therefore, naturally tends to increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the real quantity of indu&s;try, the number of productive hands, and con&s;equently the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, the real wealth and revenue of all its inhabi|tants.</P>
<P>CAPITALS are increa&s;ed by par&s;imony, and dimini&s;hed by pro|digality and mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>WHATEVER a per&s;on &s;aves from his revenue he adds to his capital, and either employs it him&s;elf in maintaining an additional number of productive hands, or enables &s;ome other per&s;on to do &s;o, by lending it to him for an intere&s;t, that is, for a &s;hare of the profits. As the capital of an individual can be increa&s;ed only by what he &s;aves from his annual revenue or his annual gains, &s;o the capital of a &s;ociety, which is the &s;ame with that of all the
<PB N="410" REF="422">
individuals who compo&s;e it, can be increa&s;ed only in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>PARSIMONY and not indu&s;try is the immediate cau&s;e of the increa&s;e of capital. Indu&s;try, indeed, provides the &s;ubject which par&s;imony accumulates. But whatever indu&s;try might acquire, if par&s;imony did not &s;ave and &s;tore up, the capital would never be the greater.</P>
<P>PARSIMONY, by increa&s;ing the fund which is de&s;tined for the maintenance of productive hands, tends to increa&s;e the number of tho&s;e hands who&s;e labour adds to the value of the &s;ubject upon which it is be&s;towed. It tends therefore to increa&s;e the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country. It puts into motion an additional quantity of indu&s;try, which gives an additional value to the annual produce.</P>
<P>WHAT is annually &s;aved is as regularly con&s;umed as what is annually &s;pent, and nearly in the &s;ame time too; but it is con|&s;umed by a different &s;ett of people. That portion of his re|venue which a rich man annually &s;pends, is in mo&s;t ca&s;es con|&s;umed by idle gue&s;ts, and menial &s;ervants, who leave nothing behind them in return for their con&s;umption. That portion which he annually &s;aves, as for the &s;ake of the profit it is im|mediately employed as a capital, is con&s;umed in the &s;ame manner, and nearly in the &s;ame time too, but by a different &s;ett of people, by labourers, manufacturers, and artificers, who re-produce with a profit the value of their annual con&s;umption. His revenue, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, is paid him in money. Had he &s;pent the whole, the food, cloathing, and lodging which the whole could have purcha&s;ed, would have been di&s;tributed among the former &s;ett of people. By &s;aving a part of it, as that part is for the
<PB N="411" REF="423">
&s;ake of the profit immediately employed as a capital either by him&s;elf or by &s;ome other per&s;on, the food, cloathing, and lodging, which may be purcha&s;ed with it, are nece&s;&s;arily re&s;erved for the latter. The con&s;umption is the &s;ame, but the con&s;umers are different.</P>
<P>BY what a frugal man annually &s;aves, he not only affords maintenance to an additional number of productive hands, for that or the en&s;uing year, but, like the founder of a publick workhou&s;e, he e&s;tabli&s;hes as it were a perpetual fund for the maintenance of an equal number in all times to come. The perpetual allotment and de&s;tination of this fund, indeed, is not always guarded by any po&s;itive law, by any tru&s;t-right or deed of mortmain. It is always guarded, however, by a very powerful principle, the plain and evident intere&s;t of every individual to whom any &s;hare of it &s;hall ever belong. No part of it can ever after|wards be employed to maintain any but productive hands, without an evident lo&s;s to the per&s;on who thus perverts it from its proper de&s;tination.</P>
<P>THE prodigal perverts it in this manner. By not confining his expence within his income, he encroaches upon his capital. Like him who perverts the revenues of &s;ome pious foundation to profane purpo&s;es, he pays the wages of idlene&s;s with tho&s;e funds which the frugality of his forefathers had, as it were, con|&s;ecrated to the maintenance of indu&s;try. By dimini&s;hing the funds de&s;tined for the employment of productive labour, he nece&s;&s;arily dimini&s;hes, &s;o far as depends upon him, the quantity of that labour which adds a value to the &s;ubject upon which it is be&s;towed, and, con&s;equently, the value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the whole country, the real wealth and revenue of its inhabitants. If the prodigality of &s;ome was not compen&s;ated by the frugality of others, the conduct of every
<PB N="412" REF="424">
prodigal, by feeding the idle with the bread of the indu&s;trious, tends not only to beggar him&s;elf, but to impoveri&s;h his country.</P>
<P>THOUGH the expence of the prodigal &s;hould be altogether in home-made and no part of it in foreign commodities, its effect upon the productive funds of the &s;ociety would &s;till be the &s;ame. Every year there would &s;till be a certain quantity of food and cloathing, which ought to have maintained productive, employed in maintaining unproductive hands. Every year, therefore, there would &s;till be &s;ome diminution in what would otherwi&s;e have been the value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country.</P>
<P>THIS expence, it may be &s;aid indeed, not being in foreign goods, and not occa&s;ioning any exportation of gold and &s;ilver, the &s;ame quantity of money would remain in the country as before. But if the quantity of food and cloathing, which were thus con&s;umed by unproductive, had been di&s;tributed among productive hands, they would have reproduced, together with a profit, the full value of their con&s;umption. The &s;ame quantity of money would in this ca&s;e equally have remained in the country, and there would be&s;ides have been a reproduction of an equal value of con&s;umable goods. There would have been two values in&s;tead of one.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame quantity of money be&s;ides cannot long remain in any country, in which the value of the annual produce dimini&s;hes. The &s;ole u&s;e of money is to circulate con&s;umable goods. By means of it, provi&s;ions, materials, and fini&s;hed work, are bought and &s;old, and di&s;tributed to their proper con&s;umers. The quantity of money, therefore, which can be annually employed in any country mu&s;t be determined by the value of the con&s;umable goods annually circulated within it. The&s;e mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t either in the
<PB N="413" REF="425">
immediate produce of the land and labour of the country it&s;elf, or in &s;omething which had been purcha&s;ed with &s;ome part of that produce. Their value, therefore, mu&s;t dimini&s;h as the value of that produce dimini&s;hes, and along with it the quantity of money which can be employed in circulating them. But the money which by this annual diminution of produce is annually thrown out of dome&s;tick circulation will not be allowed to lie idle. The intere&s;t of whoever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, requires that it &s;hould be employed. But having no employment at home, it will, in &s;pite of all laws and prohibitions, be &s;ent abroad, and employed in purcha&s;ing con&s;umable goods which may be of &s;ome u&s;e at home. Its annual exportation will in this manner continue for &s;ome time to add &s;omething to the annual con&s;umption of the country beyond the value of its own annual produce. What in the days of its pro&s;|perity had been &s;aved from that annual produce, and employed in purcha&s;ing gold and &s;ilver, will contribute for &s;ome little time to &s;upport its con&s;umption in adver&s;ity. The exportation of gold and &s;ilver is, in this ca&s;e, not the cau&s;e, but the effect of its declen|&s;ion, and may even for &s;ome little time alleviate the mi&s;ery of that declen&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE quantity of money, on the contrary, mu&s;t in every country naturally increa&s;e as the value of the annual produce increa&s;es. The value of the con&s;umable goods annually circulated within the &s;ociety being greater, will require a greater quantity of money to circulate them. A part of the increa&s;ed produce, therefore, will naturally be employed in purcha&s;ing, wherever it is to be had, the additional quantity of gold and &s;ilver nece&s;&s;ary for circulating the re&s;t. The increa&s;e of tho&s;e metals will in this ca&s;e be the effect, not the cau&s;e, of the publick pro&s;perity. Gold and &s;ilver are purcha&s;ed every where in the &s;ame manner. The food, cloathing, and lodging, the revenue and maintenance of
<PB N="414" REF="426">
all tho&s;e who&s;e labour or &s;tock is employed in bringing them from the mine to the market, is the price paid for them in Peru as well as in England. The country which has this price to pay, will never be long without the quantity of tho&s;e metals which it has occa&s;ion for; and no country will ever long retain a quantity which it has no occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>WHATEVER, therefore, we may imagine the real wealth and revenue of a country to con&s;i&s;t in, whether in the value of the annual produce of its land and labour, as plain rea&s;on &s;eems to dictate; or in the quantity of the precious metals which circulate within it, as vulgar prejudices &s;uppo&s;e; in either view of the matter, every prodigal appears to be a publick enemy, and every frugal man a publick benefactor.</P>
<P>THE effects of mi&s;conduct are often the &s;ame as tho&s;e of pro|digality. Every injudicious and un&s;ucce&s;sful project in agricul|ture, mines, fi&s;heries, trade, or manufactures, tends in the &s;ame manner to dimini&s;h the funds de&s;tined for the maintenance of productive labour. In every &s;uch project, though the capital is con&s;umed by productive hands only, yet, as by the injudicious manner in which they are employed, they do not reproduce the full value of their con&s;umption, there mu&s;t always be &s;ome dimi|nution in what would otherwi&s;e have been the productive funds of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>IT can &s;eldom happen, indeed, that the circum&s;tances of a great nation can be much affected either by the prodigality or mi&s;conduct of individuals; the profu&s;ion or imprudence of &s;ome being always more than compen&s;ated by the frugality and good conduct of others.</P>
<P><PB N="415" REF="427">
WITH regard to profu&s;ion, the principle, which prompts to expence, is the pa&s;&s;ion for pre&s;ent enjoyment; which, though &s;ome|times violent and very difficult to be re&s;trained, is in general only momentary and occa&s;ional. But the principle which prompts to &s;ave, is the de&s;ire of bettering our condition, a de&s;ire which, though generally calm and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, comes with us from the womb, and never leaves us till we go into the grave. In the whole interval which &s;eparates tho&s;e two moments, there is &s;carce perhaps a &s;ingle in&s;tant in which any man is &s;o perfectly and compleatly &s;atisfied with his &s;ituation, as to be without any wi&s;h of alteration or improvement of any kind. An augmen|tation of fortune is the means by which the greater part of men propo&s;e and wi&s;h to better their condition. It is the means the mo&s;t vulgar and the mo&s;t obvious; and the mo&s;t likely way of augmenting their fortune, is to &s;ave and accumulate &s;ome part of what they acquire, either regularly and annually, or upon &s;ome extraordinary occa&s;ions. Though the principle of expence, there|fore, prevails in almo&s;t all men upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, and in &s;ome men upon almo&s;t all occa&s;ions, yet in the greater part of men, taking the whole cour&s;e of their life at an average, the principle of frugality &s;eems not only to predominate, but to pre|dominate very greatly.</P>
<P>WITH regard to mi&s;conduct, the number of prudent and &s;uc|ce&s;sful undertakings is every where much greater than that of injudicious and un&s;ucce&s;sful ones. After all our complaints of the frequency of bankruptcies, the unhappy men who fall into this misfortune make but a very &s;mall part of the whole number engaged in trade, and all other &s;orts of bu&s;ine&s;s; not much more perhaps than one in a thou&s;and. Bankruptcy is perhaps the greate&s;t and mo&s;t humiliating calamity which can befal an innocent man. The greater part of men, therefore, are &s;ufficiently care|ful
<PB N="416" REF="428">
to avoid it. Some, indeed, do not avoid it; as &s;ome do not avoid the gallows.</P>
<P>GREAT nations are never impoveri&s;hed by private, though they &s;ometimes are by publick prodigality and mi&s;conduct. The whole, or almo&s;t the whole publick revenue, is in mo&s;t countries employed in maintaining unproductive hands. Such are the people who compo&s;e a numerous and &s;plendid court, a great eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tab|li&s;hment, great fleets and armies, who in time of peace produce nothing, and in time of war acquire nothing which can compen&s;ate the expence of maintaining them, even while the war la&s;ts. Such people, as they them&s;elves produce nothing, are all maintained by the produce of other men's labour. When multiplied, there|fore, to an unnece&s;&s;ary number, they may in a particular year con&s;ume &s;o great a &s;hare of this produce, as not to leave a &s;uf|ficiency for maintaining the productive labourers, who &s;hould re|produce it next year. The next year's produce, therefore, will be le&s;s than that of the foregoing, and if the &s;ame di&s;order &s;hould continue, that of the third year will be &s;till le&s;s than that of the &s;econd. Tho&s;e unproductive hands, who &s;hould be main|tained by a part only of the &s;pare revenue of the people, may con&s;ume &s;o great a &s;hare of their whole revenue, and thereby oblige &s;o great a number to encroach upon their capitals, upon the funds de&s;tined for the maintenance of productive labour, that all the frugality and good conduct of individuals may not be able to compen&s;ate the wa&s;te and degradation of produce occa&s;ioned by this violent and forced encroachment.</P>
<P>THIS frugality and good conduct, however, is upon mo&s;t oc|ca&s;ions, it appears from experience, &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate, not only the private prodigality and mi&s;conduct of individuals, but the publick extravagance of government. The uniform, con&s;tant,
<PB N="417" REF="429">
and uninterrupted effort of every man to better his condition, the principle from which publick and national, as well as private opulence is originally derived, is frequently powerful enough to maintain the natural progre&s;s of things towards improvement, in &s;pite both of the extravagance of government, and of the greate&s;t errors of admini&s;tration. Like the unknown principle of animal life, it frequently re&s;tores health and vigour to the con&s;titution, in &s;pite, not only of the di&s;ea&s;e, but of the ab&s;urd pre&s;criptions of the doctor.</P>
<P>THE annual produce of the land and labour of any nation can be increa&s;ed in its value by no other means, but by increa&s;ing either the number of its productive labourers, or the productive powers of tho&s;e labourers who had before been employed. The number of its productive labourers, it is evident, can never be much increa&s;ed, but in con&s;equence of an increa&s;e of capital, or of the funds de&s;tined for maintaining them. The productive powers of the &s;ame number of labourers cannot be increa&s;ed, but in con|&s;equence either of &s;ome addition and improvement to tho&s;e machines and in&s;truments which facilitate and abridge labour; or of a more proper divi&s;ion and di&s;tribution of employment. In either ca&s;e an additional capital is almo&s;t always required. It is by means of an additional capital only that the undertaker of any work can either provide his workmen with better machinery, or make a more proper di&s;tribution of employment among them. When the work to be done con&s;i&s;ts of a number of parts, to keep every man con|&s;tantly employed in one way, requires a much greater capital than where every man is occa&s;ionally employed in every different part of the work. When we compare, therefore, the &s;tate of a nation at two different periods, and find, that the annual produce of its land and labour is evidently greater at the latter than at the former, that its lands are better cultivated, its manufactures more nume|rous
<PB N="418" REF="430">
and more flouri&s;hing, and its trade more exten&s;ive, we may be a&s;&s;ured that its capital mu&s;t have increa&s;ed during the interval between tho&s;e two periods, and that more mu&s;t have been added to it by the good conduct of &s;ome, than had been taken from it either by the private mi&s;conduct of others, or by the publick extravagance of government. But we &s;hall find this to have been the ca&s;e of almo&s;t all nations, in all tolerably quiet and peaceable times, even of tho&s;e who have not enjoyed the mo&s;t prudent and par&s;imonious governments. To form a right judgement of it, indeed, we mu&s;t compare the &s;tate of the country at periods &s;omewhat di&s;tant from one another. The progre&s;s is frequently &s;o gradual, that, at near periods, the improvement is not only not &s;en&s;ible, but from the declen&s;ion either of certain branches of indu&s;try, or of certain di&s;tricts of the country, things which &s;ometimes happen though the country in general is in great pro&s;perity, there frequently ari&s;es a &s;u&s;picion, that the riches and indu&s;try of the whole are decaying.</P>
<P>THE annual produce of the land and labour of England, for example, is certainly much greater than it was, a little more than a century ago, at the re&s;toration of Charles II. Though at pre&s;ent, few people, I believe, doubt of this, yet during this period, five years have &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed away in which &s;ome book or pamphlet has not been publi&s;hed, written too with &s;uch abilities as to gain &s;ome authority with the publick, and pretending to demon&s;trate that the wealth of the nation was fa&s;t declining, that the country was depopulated, agriculture neglected, manufactures decaying, and trade undone. Nor have the&s;e publications been all party pamphlets, the wretched offspring of fal&s;hood and venality. Many of them have been written by very candid and very intelligent people; who wrote nothing but what they believed, and for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e they believed it.</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="431">
THE annual produce of the land and labour of England again, was certainly much greater at the re&s;toration, than we can &s;uppo&s;e it to have been about an hundred years before, at the acce&s;&s;ion of Elizabeth. At this period too, we have all rea&s;on to believe, the country was much more advanced in improvement, than it had been about a century before, towards the clo&s;e of the di&s;&s;en&s;ions between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter. Even then it was, probably, in a better condition than it had been at the Norman conque&s;t, and at the Norman conque&s;t, than during the confu&s;ion of the Saxon Heptarchy. Even at this early period, it was certainly a more improved country than at the inva&s;ion of Julius Cae&s;ar, when its inhabitants were nearly in the &s;ame &s;tate with the &s;avages in North America.</P>
<P>IN each of tho&s;e periods, however, there was not only much private and publick profu&s;ion, many expen&s;ive and unnece&s;&s;ary wars, great perver&s;ion of the annual produce from maintaining productive to maintain unproductive hands; but &s;ometimes, in the confu&s;ion of civil di&s;cord, &s;uch ab&s;olute wa&s;te and de&s;truction of &s;tock, as might be &s;uppo&s;ed, not only to retard, as it certainly did, the natural accumulation of riches, but to have left the country, at the end of the period, poorer than at the beginning. Thus, in the happie&s;t and mo&s;t fortunate period of them all, that which has pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the re&s;toration, how many di&s;orders and misfortunes have occurred, which, could they have been fore&s;een, not only the impoveri&s;hment, but the total ruin of the country would have been expected from them? The fire and the plague of London, the two Dutch wars, the di&s;orders of the revolution, the war in Ireland, the four expen&s;ive French wars of 1688, 1701, 1742, and 1756, together with the two rebellions of 1715 and 1745. In the cour&s;e of the four French wars, the nation has contracted more than a hundred and forty five millions of debt, over and above all the
<PB N="420" REF="432">
other extraordinary annual expence which they occa&s;ioned, &s;o that the whole cannot be computed at le&s;s than two hundred millions. So great a &s;hare of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, has, &s;ince the revolution, been employed upon different occa&s;ions, in maintaining an extraordinary number of un|productive hands. But had not tho&s;e wars given this particular direction to &s;o large a capital, the greater part of it would naturally have been employed in maintaining productive hands, who&s;e labour would have replaced, with a profit, the whole value of their con&s;umption. The value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, would have been con&s;iderably increa&s;ed by it every year, and every year's increa&s;e would have augmented &s;till more that of the next year. More hou&s;es would have been built, more lands would have been improved, and tho&s;e which had been improved before would have been better cultivated, more manufactures would have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, and tho&s;e which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed before would have been more extended; and to what height the real wealth and revenue of the country might, by this time, have been rai&s;ed, it is not perhaps very ea&s;y even to imagine.</P>
<P>BUT though the profu&s;ion of government mu&s;t, undoubtedly, have retarded the natural progre&s;s of England towards wealth and improvement, it has not been able to &s;top it. The annual produce of its land and labour is, undoubtedly, much greater at pre&s;ent than it was either at the re&s;toration or at the revolution. The capital, therefore, annually employed in cultivating this land, and in maintaining this labour, mu&s;t likewi&s;e be much greater. In the mid&s;t of all the exactions of government, this capital has been &s;ilently and gradually accumulated by the private frugality and good conduct of individuals, by their univer&s;al, continual, and uninterrupted effort to better their own condition. It is this effort,
<PB N="421" REF="433">
protected by law and allowed by liberty to exert it&s;elf in the manner that is mo&s;t advantageous, which has maintained the progre&s;s of England towards opulence and improvement in almo&s;t all former times, and which, it is to be hoped, will do &s;o in all future times. England, however, as it has never been ble&s;&s;ed with a very par&s;imonious government, &s;o par&s;imony has at no time been the characteri&s;tical virtue of its inhabitants. It is the highe&s;t im|pertinence and pre&s;umption, therefore, in kings and mini&s;ters, to pretend to watch over the oeconomy of private people, and to re&s;train their expence either by &s;umptuary laws, or by prohibiting the importation of foreign luxuries. They are them&s;elves always, and without any exception, the greate&s;t &s;pendthrifts in the &s;ociety. Let them look well after their own expence, and they may &s;afely tru&s;t private people with theirs. If their own extravagance does not ruin the &s;tate, that of their &s;ubjects never will.</P>
<P>AS frugality increa&s;es, and prodigality dimini&s;hes the publick capital, &s;o the conduct of tho&s;e, who&s;e expence ju&s;t equals their revenue, without either accumulating or encroaching, neither increa&s;es nor dimini&s;hes it. Some modes of expence, however, &s;eem to contribute more to the growth of publick opulence than others.</P>
<P>THE revenue of an individual may be &s;pent, either in things which are con&s;umed immediately, and in which one day's expence can neither alleviate nor &s;upport that of another; or it may be &s;pent in things more durable, which can therefore be accumulated, and in which every day's expence may, as he chu&s;es, either alleviate, or &s;upport and heighten the effect of that of the following day. A man of fortune, for example, may either &s;pend his revenue in a profu&s;e and &s;umptuous table, and in maintaining a great number of menial &s;ervants, and a multitude of dogs and hor&s;es; or con|tenting
<PB N="422" REF="434">
him&s;elf with a frugal table and few attendants, he may lay out the greater part of it in adorning his hou&s;e or his country villa, in u&s;eful or ornamental buildings, in u&s;eful or ornamental furniture, in collecting books, &s;tatues, pictures; or in things more frivolous, jewels, baubles, ingenious trinkets of different kinds; or, what is mo&s;t trifling of all, in ama&s;&s;ing a great wardrobe of fine clothes, like the favourite and mini&s;ter of a great prince who died a few years ago. Were two men of equal fortune to &s;pend their revenue, the one chiefly in the one way, the other in the other, the magni|ficence of the per&s;on who&s;e expence had been chiefly in durable commodities, would be continually increa&s;ing, every day's expence contributing &s;omething to &s;upport and heighten the effect of that of the following day: That of the other, on the contrary, would be no greater at the end of the period than at the beginning. The former too would, at the end of the period, be the richer man of the two. He would have a &s;tock of goods of &s;ome kind or other, which, though it might not be worth all that it co&s;t, would always be worth &s;omething. No trace or ve&s;tige of the expence of the latter would remain, and the effects of ten or twenty years pro|fu&s;ion would be as compleatly annihilated as if they had never exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>AS the one mode of expence is more favourable than the other to the opulence of an individual, &s;o is it likewi&s;e to that of a nation. The hou&s;es, the furniture, the cloathing of the rich, in a little time, become u&s;eful to the inferior and middling ranks of people. They are able to purcha&s;e them when their &s;uperiors grow weary of them, and the general accommodation of the whole people is thus gradually improved, when this mode of expence becomes univer&s;al among men of fortune. In countries which have long been rich, you will frequently find the inferior ranks of people in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion both of hou&s;es and furniture perfectly good and entire, but of
<PB N="423" REF="435">
which neither the one could have been built, nor the other have been made for their u&s;e. What was formerly a &s;eat of the family of Seymour, is now an inn upon the Bath road. The marriage bed of James the I&s;t of Great Britain, which his Queen brought with her from Denmark, as a pre&s;ent fit for a &s;overeign to make to a &s;overeign, was, a few years ago, the ornament of an alehou&s;e at Dunfermline. In &s;ome ancient cities, which either have been long &s;tationary, or have gone &s;omewhat to decay, you will &s;ometimes &s;carce find a &s;ingle hou&s;e which could have been built for its pre&s;ent inhabitants. If you go into tho&s;e hou&s;es too, you will frequently find many excellent, though antiquated pieces of furniture, which are &s;till very fit for u&s;e, and which could as little have been made for them. Noble palaces, magnificent villas, great collections of books, &s;tatues, pictures, and other curio&s;ities, are frequently both an ornament and an honour, not only to the neighbourhood, but to the whole country to which they belong. Ver&s;ailles is an ornament and an honour to France, Stowe and Wilton to England. Italy &s;till continues to command &s;ome &s;ort of veneration by the number of monuments of this kind which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, though the wealth which produced them has decayed, and the genius which planned them &s;eems to be extingui&s;hed, perhaps from not having the &s;ame employment.</P>
<P>THE expence too, which is laid out in durable commodities, is favourable, not only to accumulation, but to frugality. If a per&s;on &s;hould at any time exceed in it, he can ea&s;ily reform without expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the cen&s;ure of the publick. To reduce very much the number of his &s;ervants, to reform his table from great profu&s;ion to great frugality, to lay down his equipage after he has once &s;et it up, are changes which cannot e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of his neighbours, and which are &s;uppo&s;ed to imply &s;ome ac|knowledgement of preceding bad conduct. Few, therefore, of tho&s;e
<PB N="424" REF="436">
who have once been &s;o unfortunate as to launch out too far into this &s;ort of expence, have afterwards the courage to reform, till ruin and bankruptcy oblige them. But if a per&s;on has, at any time, been at too great an expence in building, in furniture, in books or pictures, no imprudence can be in|ferred from his changing his conduct. The&s;e are things in which further expence is frequently rendered unnece&s;&s;ary by former expence; and when a per&s;on &s;tops &s;hort, he appears to do &s;o, not becau&s;e he has exceeded his fortune, but becau&s;e he has &s;atisfied his fancy.</P>
<P>THE expence, be&s;ides, that is laid out in durable com|modities, gives maintenance, commonly, to a greater number of people, than that which is employed in the mo&s;t profu&s;e ho&s;pitality. Of two or three hundred weight of provi&s;ions, which may &s;ometimes be &s;erved up at a great fe&s;tival, one-half, perhaps, is thrown to the dunghill, and there is always a great deal wa&s;ted and abu&s;ed. But if the expence of this entertainment had been employed in &s;etting to work, ma&s;ons, carpenters, uphol&s;terers, mechanicks, a quantity of provi&s;ions, of equal value, would have been di&s;tributed among a &s;till greater number of people, who would have bought them in penny-worths and pound weights, and not have lo&s;t or thrown away a &s;ingle ounce of them. In the one way, be&s;ides, this expence maintains pro|ductive, in the other unproductive hands. In the one way, therefore, it increa&s;es, in the other, it does not increa&s;e, the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country.</P>
<P>I WOULD not, however, by all this be under&s;tood to mean, that the one &s;pecies of expence always betokens a more liberal or generous &s;pirit than the other. When a man of fortune
<PB N="425" REF="437">
&s;pends his revenue chiefly in ho&s;pitality, he &s;hares the greater part of it with his friends and companions; but when he employs it in purcha&s;ing &s;uch durable commodities, he often &s;pends the whole upon his own per&s;on, and gives nothing to any body without an equivalent. The latter &s;pecies of ex|pence, therefore, e&s;pecially when directed towards frivolous objects, the little ornaments of dre&s;s and furniture, jewels, trinkets, gewgaws, frequently indicates, not only a trifling, but a ba&s;e and &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition. All that I mean is, that the one &s;ort of expence, as it always occa&s;ions &s;ome accumu|lation of valuable commodities, as it is more favourable to private frugality, and, con&s;equently, to the increa&s;e of the publick capital, and as it maintains productive, rather than unproductive hands, conduces more than the other to the growth of publick opulence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Of Stock lent at Intere&s;t.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tock which is lent at intere&s;t is always con&s;idered as a capital by the lender. He expects that in due time it is to be re&s;tored to him, and that in the mean time the bor|rower is to pay him a certain annual rent for the u&s;e of it. The borrower may u&s;e it either as a capital, or as a &s;tock re&s;erved for immediate con&s;umption. If he u&s;es it as a capital, he employs it in the maintenance of productive labourers, who reproduce the value with a profit. He can, in this ca&s;e, both re&s;tore the capital and pay the intere&s;t without alienating or encroaching upon any other &s;ource of revenue. If he u&s;es it as a &s;tock re&s;erved for im|mediate con&s;umption, he acts the part of a prodigal, and di&s;&s;ipates in the maintenance of the idle, what was de&s;tined for the &s;upport of the indu&s;trious. He can, in this ca&s;e, neither re&s;tore the capital nor pay the intere&s;t, without either alienating or encroaching upon &s;ome other &s;ource of revenue, &s;uch as the property or the rent of land.</P>
<P>THE &s;tock which is lent at intere&s;t, is, no doubt, occa&s;ionally em|ployed in both the&s;e ways, but in the former much more frequently than in the latter. The man who borrows in order to &s;pend will &s;oon be ruined, and he who lends to him will generally have occa&s;ion to repent of his folly. To borrow or to lend for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, therefore, is in all ca&s;es, where gro&s;s u&s;ury is out of the que&s;tion, contrary to the intere&s;t of both parties; and though it no doubt happens &s;ometimes that people do both the one and the other; yet, from the regard that all men have for their own intere&s;t, we may be a&s;&s;ured, that it cannot happen &s;o very fre|quently as we are &s;ometimes apt to imagine. A&s;k any rich man
<PB N="427" REF="439">
of common prudence, to which of the two &s;orts of people he has lent the greater part of his &s;tock, to tho&s;e who, he thinks, will employ it profitably, or to tho&s;e who will &s;pend it idly, and he will laugh at you for propo&s;ing the que&s;tion. Even among borrowers, therefore, not the people in the world mo&s;t famous for frugality, the number of the frugal and indu&s;trious &s;urpa&s;&s;es con&s;iderably that of the prodigal and idle.</P>
<P>THE only people to whom &s;tock is commonly lent, without their being expected to make any very profitable u&s;e of it, are country gentlemen who borrow upon mortgage. Even they &s;carce ever borrow merely to &s;pend. What they borrow, one may &s;ay, is commonly &s;pent before they borrow it. They have generally con|&s;umed &s;o great a quantity of goods, advanced to them upon credit by &s;hopkeepers and trade&s;men, that they find it nece&s;&s;ary to borrow at intere&s;t in order to pay the debt. The capital borrowed replaces the capitals of tho&s;e &s;hopkeepers and trade&s;men, which the country gen|tlemen could not have replaced from the rents of their e&s;tates. It is not properly borrowed in order to be &s;pent, but in order to replace a capital which had been &s;pent before.</P>
<P>ALMOST all loans at intere&s;t are made in money, either of paper, or of gold and &s;ilver. But what the borrower really wants, and what the lender really &s;upplies him with, is, not the money, but the money's worth, or the goods which it can purcha&s;e. If he wants it as a &s;tock for immediate con&s;umption, it is tho&s;e goods only which he can place in that &s;tock. If he wants it as a capital for employing indu&s;try, it is from tho&s;e goods only that the indu&s;trious can be furni&s;hed with the tools, materials, and maintenance, nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on their work. By means of the loan, the lender, as it were, a&s;&s;igns to the borrower his right to a certain portion of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, to be employed as the borrower plea&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="440">
THE quantity of &s;tock, therefore, or, as it is commonly ex|pre&s;&s;ed, of money which can be lent at intere&s;t in any country, is not regulated by the value of the money, whether paper or coin, which &s;erves as the in&s;trument of the different loans made in that country, but by the value of that part of the annual produce which, as &s;oon as it comes either from the ground, or from the hands of the productive labourers, is de&s;tined not only for replacing a capital, but &s;uch a capital as the owner does not care to be at the trouble of employing him&s;elf. As &s;uch capitals are commonly lent out and paid back in money, they con&s;titute what is called the monied intere&s;t. It is di&s;tinct, not only from the landed, but from the trading and manufacturing intere&s;ts, as in the&s;e la&s;t the owners them&s;elves employ their own capitals. Even in the monied intere&s;t, however, the money is, as it were, but the deed of a&s;&s;ignment, which conveys from one hand to another tho&s;e capitals which the owners do not care to employ them&s;elves. Tho&s;e capitals may be greater in almo&s;t any proportion, than the amount of the money which &s;erves as the in&s;trument of their conveyance; the &s;ame pieces of money &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively &s;erving for many different loans, as well as for many different purcha&s;es. A, for example, lends to W a thou&s;and pounds, with which W immediately purcha&s;es of B a thou&s;and pounds worth of goods. B having no occa&s;ion for the money him&s;elf, lends the identical pieces to X, with which X immediately purcha&s;es of C another thou&s;and pounds worth of goods. C in the &s;ame manner, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, lends them to Y, who again purcha&s;es goods with them of D. In this manner the &s;ame pieces, either of coin, or of paper, may, in the cour&s;e of a few days, &s;erve as the in&s;trument of three different loans, and of three different purcha&s;es, each of which is, in value, equal to the whole amount of tho&s;e pieces. What the three monied men A, B, and C, a&s;&s;ign to the three borrowers, W, X, Y, is the power of making tho&s;e purcha&s;es. In this power con&s;i&s;t both the value and
<PB N="429" REF="441">
the u&s;e of the loans. The &s;tock lent by the three monied men, is equal to the value of the goods which can be purcha&s;ed with it, and is three times greater than that of the money with which the purcha&s;es are made. Tho&s;e loans, however, may be all perfectly well &s;ecured, the goods purcha&s;ed by the different debtors being &s;o employed, as, in due time, to bring back, with a profit, an equal value either of coin or of paper. And as the &s;ame pieces of money can thus &s;erve as the in&s;trument of different loans to three, or, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, to thirty times their value, &s;o they may likewi&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;erve as the in&s;trument of re|payment.</P>
<P>A CAPITAL lent at intere&s;t may, in this manner, be con&s;idered as an a&s;&s;ignment from the lender to the borrower of a certain con&s;iderable portion of the annual produce; upon condition that the borrower in return &s;hall, during the continuance of the loan, annually a&s;&s;ign to the lender a &s;maller portion, called the intere&s;t; and at the end of it a portion equally con&s;iderable with that which had originally been a&s;&s;igned to him, called the repayment. Though money, either coin or paper, &s;erves generally as the deed of a&s;&s;ignment both to the &s;maller, and to the more con&s;iderable portion, it is it&s;elf altogether different from what is a&s;&s;igned by it.</P>
<P>IN proportion as that &s;hare of the annual produce which, as &s;oon as it comes either from the ground, or from the hands of the productive labourers, is de&s;tined for replacing a capital, increa&s;es in any country, what is called the monied intere&s;t naturally increa&s;es with it. The increa&s;e of tho&s;e particular capitals from which the owners wi&s;h to derive a revenue, without being at the trouble of employing them them&s;elves, naturally accompanies the general increa&s;e of capitals; or in other words, as &s;tock
<PB N="430" REF="442">
increa&s;es, the quantity of &s;tock to be lent at intere&s;t grows gradually greater and greater.</P>
<P>AS the quantity of &s;tock to be lent at intere&s;t increa&s;es, the in|tere&s;t, or the price which mu&s;t be paid for the u&s;e of that &s;tock, nece&s;&s;arily dimini&s;hes, not only from tho&s;e general cau&s;es which make the market price of things commonly dimini&s;h as their quan|tity increa&s;es, but from other cau&s;es which are peculiar to this particular ca&s;e. As capitals increa&s;e in any country, the profits which can be made by employing them nece&s;&s;arily dimini&s;h. It becomes gradually more and more difficult to find within the coun|try a profitable method of employing any new capital. There ari&s;es in con&s;equence a competition between different capitals, the owner of one endeavouring to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that employment which is occupied by another. But upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions he can hope to ju&s;tle that other out of this employment, by no other means but by dealing upon more rea&s;onable terms. He mu&s;t not only &s;ell what he deals in &s;omewhat cheaper, but in order to get it to &s;ell, he mu&s;t &s;ometimes too buy it dearer. The demand for pro|ductive labour, by the increa&s;e of the funds which are de&s;tined for maintaining it, grows every day greater and greater. Labourers ea&s;ily find employment, but the owners of capitals find it difficult to get labourers to employ. Their competition rai&s;es the wages of labour, and &s;inks the profits of &s;tock. But when the profits which can be made by the u&s;e of a capital are in this manner di|mini&s;hed as it were at both ends, the price which can be paid for the u&s;e of it, that is the rate of intere&s;t, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be di|mini&s;hed with them.</P>
<P>MR. Locke, Mr. Law, and Mr. Monte&s;quiou, as well as many other writers, &s;eem to have imagined that the increa&s;e of the quantity of gold and &s;ilver, in con&s;equence of the di&s;covery of
<PB N="431" REF="443">
the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies, was the real cau&s;e of the lowering of the rate of intere&s;t through the greater part of Europe. Tho&s;e metals, they &s;ay, having become of le&s;s value them&s;elves, the u&s;e of any particular portion of them nece&s;&s;arily became of le&s;s value too, and con&s;equently the price which could be paid for it. This notion, which at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;eems &s;o plau&s;ible, has been &s;o fully expo&s;ed by Mr. Hume, that it is, perhaps, unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing more about it. The following very &s;hort and plain argu|ment, however, may &s;erve to explain more di&s;tinctly the fallacy which &s;eems to have mi&s;led tho&s;e gentlemen.</P>
<P>BEFORE the di&s;covery of the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies, ten per cent. &s;eems to have been the common rate of intere&s;t through the greater part of Europe. It has &s;ince that time in different countries &s;unk to &s;ix, five, four, and three per cent. Let us &s;uppo&s;e that in every particular country the value of &s;ilver has &s;unk preci&s;ely in the &s;ame proportion as the rate of intere&s;t; and that in tho&s;e countries, for example, where intere&s;t has been reduced from ten to five per cent. the &s;ame quantity of &s;ilver can now purcha&s;e ju&s;t half the quantity of goods which it could have purcha&s;ed before. This &s;uppo&s;ition will not, I believe, be found any where agreeable to the truth, but it is the mo&s;t favourable to the opinion which we are going to examine; and even upon this &s;uppo&s;ition it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible that the lowering of the value of &s;ilver could have the &s;malle&s;t tendency to lower the rate of intere&s;t. If a hundred pounds are in tho&s;e countries now of no more value than fifty pounds were then, ten pounds mu&s;t now be of no more value than five pounds were then. Whatever were the cau&s;es which lowered the value of the capital, the &s;ame mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have lowered that of the intere&s;t, and exactly in the &s;ame proportion. The pro|portion between the value of the capital and that of the intere&s;t, mu&s;t have remained the &s;ame, though the rate had never been
<PB N="432" REF="444">
altered. By altering the rate, on the contrary, the proportion between tho&s;e two values is nece&s;&s;arily altered. If a hundred pounds now are worth no more than fifty were then, five pounds now can be worth no more than two pounds ten &s;hillings were then. By reducing the rate of intere&s;t, therefore, from ten to five per cent. we give for the u&s;e of a capital, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be equal to one-half of its former value, an intere&s;t which is equal to one-fourth only of the value of the former intere&s;t.</P>
<P>ANY increa&s;e in the quantity of &s;ilver, while that of the com|modities circulated by means of it remained the &s;ame, could have no other effect than to dimini&s;h the value of that metal. The no|minal value of all &s;orts of goods would be greater, but their real value would be preci&s;ely the &s;ame as before. They would be ex|changed for a greater number of pieces of &s;ilver; but the quantity of labour which they could command, the number of people whom they could maintain and employ, would be preci&s;ely the &s;ame. The capital of the country would be the &s;ame, though a greater number of pieces might be requi&s;ite for conveying any equal portion of it from one hand to another. The deeds of a&s;&s;ignment, like the conveyances of a verbo&s;e attorney, would be more cum|ber&s;ome, but the thing a&s;&s;igned would be preci&s;ely the &s;ame as before, and could produce only the &s;ame effects. The funds for maintaining productive labour being the &s;ame, the demand for it would be the &s;ame. Its price or wages, therefore, though no|minally greater, would really be the &s;ame. They would be paid in a greater number of pieces of &s;ilver; but they would purcha&s;e only the &s;ame quantity of goods. The profits of &s;tock would be the &s;ame both nominally and really. The wages of labour are commonly computed by the quantity of &s;ilver which is paid to the labourer. When that is increa&s;ed, therefore, his wages appear to be increa&s;ed, though they may &s;ometimes be no greater than
<PB N="433" REF="445">
before. But the profits of &s;tock are not computed by the num|ber of pieces of &s;ilver with which they are paid, but by the pro|portion which tho&s;e pieces bear to the whole capital employed. Thus in a particular country five &s;hillings a week are &s;aid to be the common wages of labour, and ten per cent. the common profits of &s;tock. But the whole capital of the country being the &s;ame as before, the competition between the different capitals of individuals into which it was divided would likewi&s;e be the &s;ame. They would all trade with the &s;ame advantages and di&s;advantages. The common proportion between capital and profit, therefore, would be the &s;ame, and con&s;equently the common intere&s;t of mo|ney; what can commonly be given for the u&s;e of money being nece&s;&s;arily regulated by what can commonly be made by the u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>ANY increa&s;e in the quantity of commodities annually circulated within the country, while that of the money which circulated them remained the &s;ame, would, on the contrary, produce many other important effects, be&s;ides that of rai&s;ing the value of the money. The capital of the country, though it might nominally be the &s;ame, would really be augmented. It might continue to be expre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame quantity of money, but it would command a greater quantity of labour. The quantity of productive labour which it could maintain and employ would be increa&s;ed, and con|&s;equently the demand for that labour. Its wages would naturally ri&s;e with the demand, and yet might appear to &s;ink. They might be paid with a &s;maller quantity of money, but that &s;maller quantity might purcha&s;e a greater quantity of goods than a greater had done before. The profits of &s;tock would be dimini&s;hed both really and in appearance. The whole capital of the country being aug|mented, the competition between the different capitals of which it was compo&s;ed, would naturally be augmented along with it.
<PB N="434" REF="446">
The owners of tho&s;e particular capitals would be obliged to content them&s;elves with a &s;maller proportion of the produce of that labour which their re&s;pective capitals employed. The intere&s;t of money, keeping pace always with the profits of &s;tock, might, in this man|ner, be greatly dimini&s;hed, though the value of money, or the quantity of goods which any particular &s;um could purcha&s;e, was greatly augmented.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome countries the intere&s;t of money has been prohibited by law. But as &s;omething can every where be made by the u&s;e of money, &s;omething ought every where to be paid for the u&s;e of it. This regulation, in&s;tead of preventing, has been found from expe|rience to increa&s;e the evil of u&s;ury; the debtor being obliged to pay, not only for the u&s;e of the money, but for the ri&s;k which his creditor runs by accepting a compen&s;ation for that u&s;e. He is obliged, if one may &s;ay &s;o, to in&s;ure his creditor from the penalties of u&s;ury.</P>
<P>IN countries where intere&s;t is permitted, the law, in order to prevent the extortion of u&s;ury, generally fixes the highe&s;t rate which can be taken without incurring a penalty. This rate ought always to be &s;omewhat above the lowe&s;t market price, or the price which is commonly paid for the u&s;e of money by tho&s;e who can give the mo&s;t undoubted &s;ecurity. If this legal rate &s;hould be fixed below the lowe&s;t market rate, the effects of this fixation mu&s;t be nearly the &s;ame as tho&s;e of a total prohibition of intere&s;t. The creditor will not lend his money for le&s;s than the u&s;e of it is worth, and the debtor mu&s;t pay him for the ri&s;k which he runs by ac|cepting the full value of that u&s;e. If it is fixed preci&s;ely at the lowe&s;t market price, it ruins with hone&s;t people, who re&s;pect the laws of their country, the credit of all tho&s;e who cannot give the very be&s;t &s;ecurity, and obliges them to have recour&s;e to exorbitant
<PB N="435" REF="447">
u&s;urers. In a country, &s;uch as Great Britain, where money is lent to government at three per cent. and to private people upon good &s;ecurity at four and four and a half; the pre&s;ent legal rate, five per cent. is, perhaps, as proper as any.</P>
<P>THE legal rate, it is to be ob&s;erved, though it ought to be &s;ome|what above, ought not to be much above the lowe&s;t market rate. If the legal rate of intere&s;t in Great Britain, for example, was fixed &s;o high as eight or ten per cent. the greater part of the money which was to be lent, would be lent to prodigals and projectors, who alone would be willing to give this high intere&s;t. Sober people, who will give for the u&s;e of money no more than a part of what they are likely to make by the u&s;e of it, would not venture into the competition. A great part of the capital of the country would thus be kept out of the hands which were mo&s;t likely to make a profitable and advantageous u&s;e of it, and thrown into tho&s;e which were mo&s;t likely to wa&s;te and de&s;troy it. Where the legal rate of intere&s;t, on the contrary, is fixed but a very little above the lowe&s;t market rate, &s;ober people are univer&s;ally preferred, as bor|rowers, to prodigals and projectors. The per&s;on who lends money gets nearly as much intere&s;t from the former as he dares to take from the latter, and his money is much &s;afer in the hands of the one &s;ett of people than in tho&s;e of the other. A great part of the capital of the country is thus thrown into the hands in which it is mo&s;t likely to be employed with advantage.</P>
<P>No law can reduce the common rate of intere&s;t below the lowe&s;t ordinary market rate at the time when that law is made. Not|with&s;tanding the edict of 1766, by which the French king attempted to reduce the rate of intere&s;t from five to four per cent. money continued to be lent in France at five per cent; the law being evaded in &s;everal different ways.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="448">
THE ordinary market price of land, it is to be ob&s;erved, depends every where upon the ordinary market rate of intere&s;t. The per|&s;on who has a capital from which he wi&s;hes to derive a revenue, without taking the trouble to employ it him&s;elf, deliberates whether he &s;hould buy land with it, or lend it out at intere&s;t. The &s;uperior &s;ecurity of land, together with &s;ome other advantages which al|mo&s;t every where attend upon this &s;pecies of property, will generally di&s;po&s;e him to content him&s;elf with a &s;maller revenue from land, than what he might have by lending out his money at intere&s;t. The&s;e advantages are &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate a certain differ|ence of revenue; but they will compen&s;ate a certain difference only; and if the rent of land &s;hould fall &s;hort of the intere&s;t of money by a greater difference, nobody would buy land, which would &s;oon reduce its ordinary price. On the contrary, if the advantages &s;hould much more than compen&s;ate the difference, every body would buy land, which again would &s;oon rai&s;e its ordi|nary price. When intere&s;t was at ten per cent. land was com|monly &s;old for ten and twelve years purcha&s;e. As intere&s;t &s;unk to &s;ix, five, and four per cent. the price of land ro&s;e to twenty, five and twenty, and thirty years purcha&s;e. The market rate of intere&s;t is higher in France than in England; and the common price of land is lower. In England it commonly &s;ells at thirty; in France at twenty years purcha&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Of the different Employment of Capitals.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH all capitals are de&s;tined for the maintenance of productive labour only, yet the quantity of that labour, which equal capitals are capable of putting into motion, varies extreamly according to the diver&s;ity of their employment; as does likewi&s;e the value which that employment adds to the annual pro|duce of the land and labour of the country.</P>
<P>A CAPITAL may be employed in four different ways: either, fir&s;t, in procuring the rude produce annually required for the u&s;e and con&s;umption of the &s;ociety; or, &s;econdly, in manufacturing and preparing that rude produce for immediate u&s;e and con&s;ump|tion; or, thirdly, in tran&s;porting either the rude or manufactured produce from the places where they abound to tho&s;e where they are wanted; or, la&s;tly, in dividing particular portions of either into &s;uch &s;mall parcels as &s;uit the occa&s;ional demands of tho&s;e who want them. In the fir&s;t way are employed the capitals of all tho&s;e who undertake the improvement or cultivation of lands, mines, or fi&s;heries; in the &s;econd, tho&s;e of all ma&s;ter manufacturers; in the third, tho&s;e of all whole&s;ale merchants; and in the fourth, tho&s;e of all retailers. It is difficult to conceive that a capital &s;hould be employed in any way which may not be cla&s;&s;ed under &s;ome one or other of tho&s;e four.</P>
<P>EACH of tho&s;e four methods of employing a capital is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary either to the exi&s;tence or exten&s;ion of the other three, or to the general conveniency of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="450">
UNLESS a capital was employed in furni&s;hing rude produce to a certain degree of abundance, neither manufactures nor trade of any kind could exi&s;t.</P>
<P>UNLESS a capital was employed in manufacturing that part of the rude produce which requires a good deal of preparation before it can be fit for u&s;e and con&s;umption, it either would never be produced, becau&s;e there could be no demand for it; or if it was produced &s;pontaneou&s;ly, it would be of no value in exchange, and could add nothing to the wealth of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>UNLESS a capital was employed in tran&s;porting either the rude or manufactured produce from the places where it abounds to tho&s;e where it is wanted, no more of either could be produced than was nece&s;&s;ary for the con&s;umption of the neighbourhood. The capital of the merchant exchanges the &s;urplus produce of one place for that of another, and thus encourages the indu&s;try and increa&s;es the enjoyments of both.</P>
<P>UNLESS a capital was employed in breaking and dividing certain portions either of the rude or manufactured produce, into &s;uch &s;mall parcels as &s;uit the occa&s;ional demands of tho&s;e who want them, every man would be obliged to purcha&s;e a greater quantity of the goods he wanted, than his immediate occa&s;ions required. If there was no &s;uch trade as a butcher, for example, every man would be obliged to purcha&s;e a whole ox or a whole &s;heep at a time. This would generally be inconvenient to the rich, and much more &s;o to the poor. If a poor workman was obliged to purcha&s;e a month's or &s;ix months provi&s;ions at a time, a great part of the &s;tock which he employs as a capital, in the in&s;truments of his trade, or in the furniture of his &s;hop, and which yields him a revenue, he would be forced to place in that part of his &s;tock which is re&s;erved for
<PB N="439" REF="451">
immediate con&s;umption, and which yields him no revenue. Nothing can be more convenient for &s;uch a per&s;on than to be able to purcha&s;e his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from day to day, or even from hour to hour as he wants it. He is thereby enabled to employ almo&s;t his whole &s;tock as a capital. He is thus enabled to furni&s;h work to a greater value, and the profit which he makes by it in this way much more than compen&s;ates the additional price which the profit of the retailer impo&s;es upon the goods. The prejudices of &s;ome political writers again&s;t &s;hopkeepers and trade&s;men, are altogether without foundation. So far is it from being nece&s;&s;ary either to tax them or to re&s;trict their numbers, that they can never be multiplied &s;o as to hurt the publick, though they may &s;o as to hurt one another. The quantity of grocery goods, for example, which can be &s;old in a particular town, is limited by the demand of that town and neighbourhood. The capital, therefore, which can be employed in the grocery trade cannot exceed what is &s;uf|ficient to purcha&s;e that quantity. If this capital is divided between two different grocers, their competition will tend to make both of them &s;ell cheaper, than if it were in the hands of one only; and if it were divided among twenty, their competition would be ju&s;t &s;o much the greater, and the chance of their combining to|gether, in order to rai&s;e the price, ju&s;t &s;o much the le&s;s. Their competition might perhaps ruin &s;ome of them&s;elves; but to take care of this is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the parties concerned, and it may &s;afely be tru&s;ted to their di&s;cretion. It can never hurt either the con&s;umer, or the producer; on the contrary, it mu&s;t tend to make the retailers both &s;ell cheaper and buy dearer, than if the whole trade was monopolized by one or two per&s;ons. Some of them, perhaps, may &s;ometimes decoy a weak cu&s;tomer to buy what he has no occa&s;ion for. This evil, however, is of too little impor|tance to de&s;erve the publick attention, nor would it nece&s;&s;arily be prevented by re&s;tricting their numbers. It is not the multitude
<PB N="440" REF="452">
of ale-hou&s;es, to give the mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious example, that occa&s;ions a general di&s;po&s;ition to drunkenne&s;s among the common people; but that di&s;po&s;ition ari&s;ing from other cau&s;es nece&s;&s;arily gives em|ployment to a multitude of ale-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>THE per&s;ons who&s;e capitals are employed in any of tho&s;e four ways are them&s;elves productive labourers. Their labour, when properly directed, fixes and realizes it&s;elf in the &s;ubject or vendible commodity upon which it is be&s;towed, and generally adds to its price the value at lea&s;t of their own maintenance and con&s;umption. The profits of the farmer, of the manufacturer, of the merchant, and retailer, are all drawn from the price of the goods which the two fir&s;t produce, and the two la&s;t buy and &s;ell. Equal capitals however, employed in each of tho&s;e four different ways, will put into motion very different quantities of productive labour, and aug|ment too in very different proportions the value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the &s;ociety to which they belong.</P>
<P>THE capital of the retailer replaces, together with its profits, that of the merchant of whom he purcha&s;es goods, and thereby en|ables him to continue his bu&s;ine&s;s. The retailer him&s;elf is the only productive labourer whom it employs. In his profits, con&s;i&s;ts the whole value which its employment adds to the annual produce of the land and labour of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE capital of the whole&s;ale merchant replaces, together with their profits, the capitals of the farmers and manufacturers of whom he purcha&s;es the rude and manufactured produce which he deals in, and thereby enables them to continue their re&s;pective trades. It is by this &s;ervice chiefly that he contributes indirectly to &s;upport the productive labour of the &s;ociety, and to increa&s;e the value of
<PB N="441" REF="453">
its annual produce. His capital employs too the &s;ailors and carriers who tran&s;port his goods from one place to another, and it augments the price of tho&s;e goods by the value, not only of his profits, but of their wages. This is all the productive labour which it immediately puts into motion, and all the value which it immediately adds to the annual produce. Its operation in both the&s;e re&s;pects is a good deal &s;uperior to that of the capital of the retailer.</P>
<P>PART of the capital of the ma&s;ter manufacturer is employed as a fixed capital in the in&s;truments of his trade, and replaces, together with its profits, that of &s;ome other artificer of whom he purcha&s;es them. Part of his circulating capital is employed in purcha&s;ing materials, and replaces, with their profits, the capitals of the farmers and miners of whom he purcha&s;es them. But a great part of it is always, either annually, or in a much &s;horter period, di&s;tributed among the different workmen whom he employs. It augments the value of tho&s;e materials by their wages, and by their ma&s;ters profits upon the whole &s;tock of wages, materials, and in&s;truments of trade employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s. It puts into motion, there|fore, a much greater quantity of productive labour, and adds a much greater value to the annual produce of the land and labour of the &s;ociety, than an equal capital in the hands of any whole|&s;ale merchant.</P>
<P>NO equal capital puts into motion a greater quantity of productive labour than that of the farmer. Not only his labouring &s;ervants, but his labouring cattle, are productive labourers. In agriculture too nature labours along with man; and though her labour co&s;ts no expence, its produce has its value, as well as that of the mo&s;t expen|&s;ive workmen. The mo&s;t important operations of agriculture &s;eem intended, not &s;o much to increa&s;e, though they do that too, as to
<PB N="442" REF="454">
direct the fertility of nature towards the production of the plants mo&s;t profitable to man. A field overgrown with briars and brambles may frequently produce as great a quantity of vegetables as the be&s;t cultivated vineyard or corn field. Planting and tillage fre|quently regulate more than they animate the active fertility of nature; and after all their labour, a great part of the work always remains to be done by her. The labourers and labouring cattle, therefore, employed in agriculture, not only occa&s;ion, like the workmen in manufacturers, the reproduction of a value equal to their own con&s;umption, or to the capital which employs them, together with its owners profits; but of a much greater value. Over and above the capital of the farmer and all its profits, they regu|larly occa&s;ion the reproduction of the rent of the landlord. This rent may be con&s;idered as the produce of tho&s;e powers of nature, the u&s;e of which the landlord lends to the farmer. It is greater or &s;maller according to the &s;uppo&s;ed extent of tho&s;e powers, or, in other words, according to the &s;uppo&s;ed natural or improved fertility of the land. It is the work of nature which remains after deducting or compen&s;ating every thing which can be regarded as the work of man. It is &s;eldom le&s;s than a fourth, and frequently more than a third of the whole produce. No equal quantity of productive labour employed in manufactures can ever occa&s;ion &s;o great a reproduction. In them nature does nothing; man does all; and the reproduction mu&s;t always be in proportion to the &s;trength of the agents that occa&s;ion it. The capital employed in agriculture, therefore, not only puts into motion a greater quantity of productive labour than any equal capital employed in manu|factures, but in proportion too to the quantity of productive labour which it employs, it adds a much greater value to the annual pro|duce of the land and labour of the country, to the real wealth and revenue of its inhabitants. Of all the ways in which a
<PB N="443" REF="455">
capital can be employed, it is by far the mo&s;t advantageous to the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE capitals employed in the agriculture and in the retail trade of any &s;ociety, mu&s;t always re&s;ide within that &s;ociety. Their em|ployment is confined almo&s;t to a preci&s;e &s;pot, to the farm, and to the &s;hop of the retailer. They mu&s;t generally too, though there are &s;ome exceptions to this, belong to re&s;ident members of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE capital of a whole&s;ale merchant, on the contrary, &s;eems to have no fixed or nece&s;&s;ary re&s;idence any-where, but may wander about from place to place, according as it can either buy cheap or &s;ell dear.</P>
<P>THE capital of the manufacturer mu&s;t no doubt re&s;ide where the manufacture is carried on; but where this &s;hall be, is not always nece&s;&s;arily determined. It may frequently be at a great di&s;tance both from the place where the materials grow, and from that where the compleat manufacture is con&s;umed. Lyons is very di&s;|tant both from the places which afford the materials of its manu|factures, and from tho&s;e which con&s;ume them. The people of fa&s;hion in Sicily are cloathed in &s;ilks made in other countries, from the materials which their own produces. Part of the wool of Spain is manufactured in Great Britain, and &s;ome part of that cloth is afterwards &s;ent back to Spain.</P>
<P>WHETHER the merchant who&s;e capital exports the &s;urplus pro|duce of any &s;ociety be a native or a foreigner, is of very little im|portance. If he is a foreigner, the number of their productive labourers is nece&s;&s;arily le&s;s than if he had been a native by one man only; and the value of their annual produce, by the pro|fits
<PB N="444" REF="456">
of that one man. The &s;ailors or carriers whom he employs may &s;till belong indifferently either to his country, or to their country, or to &s;ome third country, in the &s;ame manner as if he had been a native. The capital of a foreigner gives a value to their &s;urplus produce equally with that of a native, by exchanging it for &s;omething for which there is a demand at home. It as effectually replaces the capital of the per&s;on who produces that &s;urplus, and as effectually enables him to continue his bu&s;ine&s;s; the &s;ervice by which the capital of a whole&s;ale merchant chiefly contributes to &s;upport the productive labour, and to augment the value of the annual produce of the &s;ociety to which he belongs.</P>
<P>IT is of more con&s;equence that the capital of the manufacturer &s;hould re&s;ide within the country. It nece&s;&s;arily puts into motion a greater quantity of productive labour, and adds a greater value to the annual produce of the land and labour of the &s;ociety. It may, however, be very u&s;eful to the country, though it &s;hould not re&s;ide within it. The capitals of the Briti&s;h manufacturers who work up the flax and hemp annually imported from the coa&s;ts of the Baltick, are &s;urely very u&s;eful to the countries which produce them. Tho&s;e materials are a part of the &s;urplus produce of tho&s;e countries which, unle&s;s it was annually exchanged for &s;omething which is in demand there, would be of no value, and would &s;oon cea&s;e to be produced. The merchants who export it, replace the capitals of the people who produce it, and thereby encourage them to continue the production; and the Briti&s;h manufacturers replace the capitals of tho&s;e merchants.</P>
<P>A PARTICULAR country, in the &s;ame manner as a particular per&s;on, may frequently not have capital &s;ufficient both to improve and cultivate all its lands, to manufacture and prepare their whole rude produce for immediate u&s;e and con&s;umption, and to tran&s;port
<PB N="445" REF="457">
the &s;urplus part either of the rude or manufactured produce to tho&s;e di&s;tant markets where it can be exchanged for &s;omething for which there is a demand at home. The inhabitants of many different parts of Great Britain have not capital &s;ufficient to im|prove and cultivate all their lands. The wool of the &s;outhern counties of Scotland is, a great part of it, after a long land car|riage through very bad roads, manufactured in York&s;hire, for want of a capital to manufacture it at home. There are many little manufacturing towns in Great Britain, of which the inhabitants have not capital &s;ufficient to tran&s;port the produce of their own indu&s;try to tho&s;e di&s;tant markets where there is demand and con|&s;umption for it. If there are any merchants among them, they are properly only the agents of wealthier merchants who re&s;ide in &s;ome of the greater commercial cities.</P>
<P>WHEN the capital of any country is not &s;ufficient for all tho&s;e three purpo&s;es, in proportion as a greater &s;hare of it is employed in agriculture, the greater will be the quantity of productive labour which it puts into motion within the country; as will likewi&s;e be the value which its employment adds to the annual produce of the land and labour of the &s;ociety. After agriculture, the capital employed in manufactures put into motion the greate&s;t quantity of productive labour, and adds the greate&s;t value to the annual produce. That which is employed in the trade of exportation, has the lea&s;t effect of any of the three.</P>
<P>THE country, indeed, which has not capital &s;ufficient for all tho&s;e three purpo&s;es, has not arrived at that degree of opulence for which it &s;eems naturally de&s;tined. To attempt, however, pre|maturely and with an in&s;ufficient capital, to do all the three, is certainly not the &s;horte&s;t way for a &s;ociety, no more than it would be for an individual, to acquire a &s;ufficient one. The capital of
<PB N="446" REF="458">
all the individuals of a nation, has its limits in the &s;ame manner as that of a &s;ingle individual, and is capable of executing only cer|tain purpo&s;es. The capital of all the individuals of a nation is increa&s;ed in the &s;ame manner as that of a &s;ingle individual, by their continually accumulating and adding to it whatever they &s;ave out of their revenue. It is likely to increa&s;e the fa&s;te&s;t, therefore, when it is employed in the way that affords the greate&s;t revenue to all the inhabitants of the country, as they will thus be enabled to make the greate&s;t &s;avings. But the revenue of all the inhabi|tants of the country is nece&s;&s;arily in proportion to the value of the annual produce of their land and labour.</P>
<P>IT has been the principal cau&s;e of the rapid progre&s;s of our American colonies towards wealth and greatne&s;s, that almo&s;t their whole capitals have hitherto been employed in agriculture. They have no manufactures, tho&s;e hou&s;hold and coar&s;er manufactures excepted which nece&s;&s;arily accompany the progre&s;s of agriculture, and which are the work of the women and children in every pri|vate family. The greater part both of the exportation and coa&s;ting trade of America, is carried on by the capitals of merchants who re&s;ide in Great Britain. Even the &s;tores and warehou&s;es from which goods are retailed in &s;ome provinces, particularly in Vir|ginia and Maryland, belong many of them to merchants who re&s;ide in the mother country, and afford one of the few in&s;tances of the retail trade of a &s;ociety being carried on by the capitals of tho&s;e who are not re&s;ident members of it. Were the Americans, either by combination or by any other &s;ort of violence, to &s;top the im|portation of European manufactures, and, by thus giving a mo|nopoly to &s;uch of their own countrymen as could manufacture the like goods, divert any con&s;iderable part of their capital into this employment, they would retard in&s;tead of accelerating the further increa&s;e in the value of their annual produce, and would ob&s;truct
<PB N="447" REF="459">
in&s;tead of promoting the progre&s;s of their country towards real wealth and greatne&s;s. This would be &s;till more the ca&s;e, were they to attempt, in the &s;ame manner, to monopolize to them&s;elves their whole exportation trade.</P>
<P>THE cour&s;e of human pro&s;perity, indeed, &s;eems &s;earce ever to have been of &s;o long continuance as to enable any great country to acquire capital &s;ufficient for all tho&s;e three purpo&s;es; unle&s;s, perhaps, we give credit to the wonderful accounts of the wealth and cultivation of China, of tho&s;e of antient Egypt, and of the antient &s;tate of Indo&s;tan. Even tho&s;e three countries, the wealthie&s;t, according to all accounts, that ever were in the world, are chiefly renowned for their &s;uperiority in agriculture and manufactures. They do not appear to have been eminent for foreign trade. The antient Egyptians had a &s;uper&s;titious antipathy to the &s;ea; a &s;uper|&s;tition nearly of the &s;ame kind prevails among the Indians; and the Chine&s;e have never excelled in foreign commerce. The greater part of the &s;urplus produce of all tho&s;e three countries &s;eems to have been always exported by foreigners, who gave in exchange for it &s;omething el&s;e for which they found a demand there, frequently gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P>IT is thus that the &s;ame capital will in any country put into motion a greater or &s;maller quantity of productive labour, and add a greater or &s;maller value to the annual produce of its land and labour, according to the different proportions in which it is em|ployed in agriculture, manufactures, and whole&s;ale trade. The difference too is very great, according to the different &s;orts of whole|&s;ale trade in which any part of it is employed.</P>
<P>ALL whole&s;ale trade, all buying in order to &s;ell again by whole|&s;ale, may be reduced to three different &s;orts. The home trade, the foreign trade of con&s;umption, and the carrying trade. The home
<PB N="448" REF="460">
trade is employed in purcha&s;ing in one part of the &s;ame country, and &s;elling in another, the produce of the indu&s;try of that country. It comprehends both the inland and the coa&s;ting trade. The foreign trade of con&s;umption is employed in purcha&s;ing foreign goods for home con&s;umption. The carrying trade is employed in tran&s;|acting the commerce of foreign countries, or in carrying the &s;ur|plus produce of one to another.</P>
<P>THE capital which is employed in purcha&s;ing in one part of the country in order to &s;ell in another the produce of the indu&s;try of that country, generally replaces by every &s;uch operation two di&s;tinct capitals that had both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures of that country, and thereby enables them to con|tinue that employment. When it &s;ends out from the re&s;idence of the merchant a certain value of commodities, it generally brings back in return at lea&s;t an equal value of other commodities. When both are the produce of dome&s;tick indu&s;try, it nece&s;&s;arily replaces by every &s;uch operation two di&s;tinct capitals, which had both been employed in &s;upporting productive labour, and thereby enables them to continue that &s;upport. The capital which &s;ends Scotch manufactures to London, and brings back Engli&s;h corn and manufactures to Edinburgh, nece&s;&s;arily replaces, by every &s;uch operation, two Briti&s;h capitals which had both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures of Great Britain.</P>
<P>THE capital employed in purcha&s;ing foreign goods for home|con&s;umption, when this purcha&s;e is made with the produce of dome&s;tick indu&s;try, replaces too, by every &s;uch operation, two di&s;tinct capitals; but one of them only is employed in &s;upporting dome&s;tick indu&s;try. The capital which &s;ends Briti&s;h goods to Portugal, and brings back Portugue&s;e goods to Great Britain, re|places by every &s;uch operation only one Briti&s;h capital. The other
<PB N="449" REF="461">
is a Portugue&s;e one. Though the returns, therefore, of the foreign trade of con&s;umption &s;hould be as quick as tho&s;e of the home-trade, the capital employed in it will give but one-half the encouragement to the indu&s;try or productive labour of the country.</P>
<P>BUT the returns of the foreign trade of con&s;umption are very &s;eldom &s;o quick as tho&s;e of the home-trade. The returns of the home-trade generally come in before the end of the year, and &s;ometimes three or four times in the year. The returns of the foreign trade of con&s;umption &s;eldom come in before the end of the year, and &s;ometimes not till after two or three years. A capital, therefore, employed in the home-trade will &s;ometimes make twelve operations, or be &s;ent out and returned twelve times, before a capi|tal employed in the foreign trade of con&s;umption has made one. If the capitals are equal, therefore, the one will give four and twenty times more encouragement and &s;upport to the indu&s;try of the country than the other.</P>
<P>THE foreign goods for home-con&s;umption may &s;ometimes be purcha&s;ed, not with the produce of dome&s;tick indu&s;try, but with &s;ome other foreign goods. The&s;e la&s;t, however, mu&s;t have been purcha&s;ed either immediately with the produce of dome&s;tick indu&s;try, or with &s;omething el&s;e that had been purcha&s;ed with it; for the ca&s;e of war and conque&s;t excepted, foreign goods can never be acquired, but in exchange for &s;omething that had been produced at home, either immediately, or after two or more different ex|changes. The effects, therefore, of a capital employed in &s;uch a round about foreign trade of con&s;umption, are, in every re&s;pect, the &s;ame as tho&s;e of one employed in the mo&s;t direct trade of the &s;ame kind, except that the final returns are likely to be &s;till more di&s;tant, as they mu&s;t depend upon the returns of two or three di&s;tinct foreign trades. If the flax and hemp of Riga are pur|cha&s;ed with the tobacco of Virginia, which had been purcha&s;ed
<PB N="450" REF="462">
with Briti&s;h manufactures, the merchant mu&s;t wait for the returns of two di&s;tinct foreign trades before he can employ the &s;ame ca|pital in re-purcha&s;ing a like quantity of Briti&s;h manufactures. If the tobacco of Virginia had been purcha&s;ed, not with Briti&s;h manufactures, but with the &s;ugar and rum of Jamaica which had been purcha&s;ed with tho&s;e manufactures, he mu&s;t wait for the returns of three. If tho&s;e two or three di&s;tinct foreign trades &s;hould happen to be carried on by two or three di&s;tinct merchants, of whom the &s;econd buys the goods imported by the fir&s;t, and the third buys tho&s;e imported by the &s;econd, in order to export them again, each merchant indeed will in this ca&s;e receive the returns of his own capital more quickly; but the final returns of the whole capital employed in the trade will be ju&s;t as &s;low as ever. Whe|ther the whole capital employed in &s;uch a round about trade belong to one merchant or to three, can make no difference with regard to the country, though it may with regard to the particu|lar merchants. Three times a greater capital mu&s;t in both ca&s;es be employed, in order to exchange a certain value of Briti&s;h ma|nufactures for a certain quantity of flax and hemp, than would have been nece&s;&s;ary, had the manufactures and the flax and hemp been directly exchanged for one another. The whole capital em|ployed, therefore, in &s;uch a round about foreign trade of con|&s;umption, will generally give le&s;s encouragement and &s;upport to the productive labour of the country, than an equal capital employed in a more direct trade of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>WHATEVER be the foreign commodity with which the foreign goods for home-con&s;umption are purcha&s;ed, it can occa&s;ion no e&s;&s;ential difference either in the nature of the trade, or in the en|couragement and &s;upport which it can give to the productive labour of the country from which it is carried on. If they are pur|cha&s;ed with the gold of Brazil, for example, or with the &s;ilver
<PB N="451" REF="463">
of Peru, this gold and &s;ilver, like the tobacco of Virginia, mu&s;t have been purcha&s;ed with &s;omething that either was the produce of the indu&s;try of the country, or that had been purcha&s;ed with &s;omething el&s;e that was &s;o. So far, therefore, as the productive labour of the country is concerned, the foreign trade of con&s;umption which is carried on by means of gold and &s;ilver, has all the advantages and all the inconveniencies of any other equally round about foreign trade of con&s;umption, and will replace ju&s;t as fa&s;t or ju&s;t as &s;low the capital which is immediately employed in &s;upporting that productive labour. It &s;eems even to have one advantage over any other equally round about foreign trade. The tran&s;portation of tho&s;e metals from one place to another, on account of their &s;mall bulk and great value, is le&s;s expen&s;ive than that of almo&s;t any other foreign goods of equal value. Their freight is much le&s;s, and their in&s;urance not greater. An equal quantity of foreign goods, therefore, may frequently be purcha&s;ed with a &s;maller quantity of the produce of dome&s;tick indu&s;try, by the intervention of gold and &s;ilver, than by that of any other foreign goods. The demand of the country may frequently, in this manner, be &s;upplied more compleatly and at a &s;maller expence than in any other. Whether, by the con|tinual exportation of tho&s;e metals, a trade of this kind is likely to impoveri&s;h the country from which it is carried on, in any other way, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to examine at great length here|after.</P>
<P>THAT part of the capital of any country which is employed in the carrying trade, is altogether withdrawn from &s;upporting the productive labour of that particular country, to &s;upport that of &s;ome foreign countries. Though it may replace by every operation two di&s;tinct capitals, yet neither of them belong to that particular country. The capital of the Dutch merchant, which carries the corn of Poland to Portugal, and brings back the fruits and wines
<PB N="452" REF="464">
of Portugal to Poland, replaces by every &s;uch operation two capitals, neither of which had been employed in &s;upporting the productive labour of Holland; but one of them in &s;upporting that of Poland, and the other that of Portugal. The profits only return regularly to Holland, and con&s;titute the whole addition which this trade nece&s;&s;arily makes to the annual produce of the land and labour of that country. When, indeed, the carrying trade of any particular country is carried on with the &s;hips and &s;ailors of that country, that part of the capital employed in it which pays the freight, is di|&s;tributed among, and puts into motion a certain number of pro|ductive labourers of that country. Almo&s;t all nations that have had any con&s;iderable &s;hare of the carrying trade have, in fact, carried it on in this manner. The trade it&s;elf has probably de|rived its name from it, the people of &s;uch countries being the carriers to other countries. It does not, however, &s;eem e&s;&s;ential to the nature of the trade that it &s;hould be &s;o. A Dutch merchant may, for example, employ his capital in tran&s;acting the commerce of Poland and Portugal, by carrying part of the &s;urplus produce of the one to the other, not in Dutch, but in Briti&s;h bottoms. It may be pre&s;umed, that he actually does &s;o upon &s;ome particular occa&s;ions. It is upon this account, however, that the carrying trade has been &s;uppo&s;ed peculiarly advantageous to &s;uch a country as Great Britain, of which the defence and &s;ecurity depend upon the number of its &s;ailors and &s;hipping. But the &s;ame capital may employ as many &s;ailors and &s;hipping, either in the foreign trade of con&s;umption, or even in the home-trade, when carried on by coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;els, as it could in the carrying trade. The number of &s;ailors and &s;hipping which any particular capital can employ, does not depend upon the nature of the trade, but partly upon the bulk of the goods in proportion to their value, and partly upon the di&s;tance of the ports between which they are to be car|ried; chiefly upon the former of tho&s;e two circum&s;tances. The coal-trade from Newca&s;tle to London, for example, employs more
<PB N="453" REF="465">
&s;hipping than all the carrying trade of England, though the ports are at no great di&s;tance. To force, therefore, by extraordinary encouragements, a larger &s;hare of the capital of any country into the carrying trade, than what would naturally go to it, will not always nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e the &s;hipping of that country.</P>
<P>THE capital, therefore, employed in the home-trade of any country will generally give encouragement and &s;upport to a greater quantity of productive labour in that country, and increa&s;e the value of its annual produce more than an equal capital employed in the foreign trade of con&s;umption: and the capital employed in this latter trade has in both the&s;e re&s;pects a &s;till greater advantage over an equal capital employed in the carrying trade. The riches, and, &s;o far as power depends upon riches, the power of every country, mu&s;t al|ways be in proportion to the value of its annual produce, the fund from which all taxes mu&s;t ultimately be paid. But the great object of the political oeconomy of every country, is to encrea&s;e the riches and power of that country. It ought, therefore, to give no preference nor &s;uperior encouragement to the foreign trade of con&s;umption above the home-trade, nor to the carrying trade above either of the other two. It ought neither to force nor to allure into either of tho&s;e two channels, a greater &s;hare of the ca|pital of the country than what would naturally flow into them of its own accord.</P>
<P>EACH of tho&s;e different branches of trade, however, is not only advantageous, but nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable, when the cour&s;e of things without any con&s;traint or violence naturally in|troduces it.</P>
<P>WHEN the produce of any particular branch of indu&s;try exceeds what the demand of the country requires, the &s;urplus mu&s;t be
<PB N="454" REF="466">
&s;ent abroad, and exchanged for &s;omething for which there is a demand at home. Without &s;uch exportation, a part of the pro|ductive labour of the country mu&s;t cea&s;e, and the value of its annual produce dimini&s;h. The land and labour of Great Britain produce generally more corn, woollens, and hard ware, than the demand of the home-market requires. The &s;urplus part of them, there|fore, mu&s;t be &s;ent abroad, and exchanged for &s;omething for which there is a demand at home. It is only by means of &s;uch ex|portation, that this &s;urplus can acquire a value &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate the labour and expence of producing it. The neigh|bourhood of the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and the banks of all navigable rivers, are advantageous &s;ituations for indu&s;try, only becau&s;e they facilitate the exportation and exchange of &s;uch &s;urplus produce for &s;ome|thing el&s;e which is more in demand there.</P>
<P>WHEN the foreign goods which are thus purcha&s;ed with the &s;ur|plus produce of dome&s;tick indu&s;try exceed the demand of the home|market, the &s;urplus part of them mu&s;t be &s;ent abroad again, and exchanged for &s;omething more in demand at home. About ninety-&s;ix thou&s;and hog&s;heads of tobacco are annually purcha&s;ed in Virginia and Maryland, with a part of the &s;urplus produce of Briti&s;h indu&s;try. But the demand of Great Britain does not require, perhaps, more than fourteen thou&s;and. If the remaining eighty-two thou&s;and, therefore, could not be &s;ent abroad and ex|changed for &s;omething more in demand at home, the importation of them mu&s;t cea&s;e immediately, and with it the productive labour of all tho&s;e inhabitants of Great Britain, who are at pre&s;ent em|ployed in preparing the goods with which the&s;e eighty-two thou|&s;and hog&s;heads are annually purcha&s;ed. Tho&s;e goods, which are part of the produce of the land and labour of Great Britain, having no market at home, and being deprived of that which they had abroad, mu&s;t cea&s;e to be produced. The mo&s;t round about foreign
<PB N="455" REF="467">
trade of con&s;umption, therefore, may, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, be as nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting the productive labour of the country, and the value of its annual produce, as the mo&s;t direct.</P>
<P>WHEN the capital &s;tock of any country is increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that it cannot be all employed in &s;upplying the con&s;ump|tion, and &s;upporting the productive labour of that particular coun|try, the &s;urplus part of it naturally di&s;gorges it&s;elf into the carrying trade, and is employed in performing the &s;ame offices to other countries. The carrying trade is the natural effect and &s;ymptom of great national wealth: but it does not &s;eem to be the natural cau&s;e of it. Tho&s;e &s;tate&s;men who have been di&s;po&s;ed to favour it with particular encouragements, &s;eem to have mi&s;taken the effect and &s;ymptom for the cau&s;e. Holland, in proportion to the extent of the land and the number of its inhabitants, by far the riche&s;t country in Europe, has, accordingly, the greate&s;t &s;hare of the carrying trade of Europe. England, perhaps the &s;econd riche&s;t country of Europe, is likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed to have a con|&s;iderable &s;hare of it; though what commonly pa&s;&s;es for the carrying trade of England, will frequently, perhaps, be found to be no more than a round about foreign trade of con&s;umption. Such are, in a great mea&s;ure, the trades which carry the goods of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, and of America, to different European markets. Tho&s;e goods are generally purcha&s;ed either immediately with the produce of Briti&s;h indu&s;try, or with &s;omething el&s;e which had been purcha&s;ed with that produce, and the final returns of tho&s;e trades are generally u&s;ed or con&s;umed in Great Britain. The trade which is carried on in Briti&s;h bottoms between the different ports of the Mediterranean, and &s;ome trade of the &s;ame kind car|ried on by Briti&s;h merchants between the different ports of India, make, perhaps, the principal branches of what is properly the carrying trade of Great Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="468">
THE extent of the home-trade and of the capital which can be employed in it, is nece&s;&s;arily limited by the value of the &s;urplus produce of all tho&s;e di&s;tant places within the country which have occa&s;ion to exchange their re&s;pective productions with one another. That of the foreign trade of con&s;umption, by the value of the &s;ur|plus produce of the whole country and of what can be purcha&s;ed with it. That of the carrying trade, by the value of the &s;urplus produce of all the different countries in the world. Its po&s;&s;ible extent, therefore, is in a manner infinite in compari&s;on of that of the other two, and is capable of ab&s;orbing the greate&s;t ca|pitals.</P>
<P>THE con&s;ideration of his own private profit, is the &s;ole motive which determines the owner of any capital to employ it either in agriculture, in manufactures, or in &s;ome particular branch of the whole&s;ale or retail trade. The different quantities of productive labour which it may put into motion, and the different values which it may add to the annual produce of the land and labour of the &s;ociety, according as it is employed in one or other of tho&s;e dif|ferent ways, never enter into his thoughts. In countries, there|fore, where agriculture is the mo&s;t profitable of all employments, and farming and improving the mo&s;t direct roads to a &s;plendid fortune, the capitals of individuals will naturally be employed in the manner mo&s;t advantageous to the whole &s;ociety. The profits of agriculture, however, &s;eem to have no &s;uperiority over tho&s;e of other employments in any part of Europe. Projectors, indeed, in every corner of it, have within the&s;e few years amu&s;ed the pub|lick with mo&s;t magnificent accounts of the profits to be made by the cultivation and improvement of land. Without entering into any particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of their calculations, a very &s;imple ob|&s;ervation may &s;atisfy us that the re&s;ult of them mu&s;t be fal&s;e. We &s;ee every day the mo&s;t &s;plendid fortunes that have been acquired
<PB N="457" REF="469">
in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle life by trade and manufactures, frequently from a very &s;mall capital, &s;ometimes from no capital. A &s;ingle in&s;tance of &s;uch a fortune acquired by agriculture in the &s;ame time, and from &s;uch a capital, has not, perhaps, occurred in Europe during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century. In all the great countries of Europe, however, much good land &s;till remains un|cultivated, and the greater part of what is cultivated is far from being improved to the degree of which it is capable. Agriculture, therefore, is almo&s;t every where capable of ab&s;orbing a much greater capital than has ever yet been employed in it. What cir|cum&s;tances in the policy of Europe have given the trades which are carried on in towns &s;o great an advantage over that which is carried on in the country, that private per&s;ons frequently find it more for their advantage to employ their capitals in the mo&s;t di&s;tant carrying trades of A&s;ia and America, than in the improve|ment and cultivation of the mo&s;t fertile fields in their own neigh|bourhood, I &s;hall endeavour to explain at full length in the two following books.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. 1. <HI>Of the natural Progre&s;s of Opulence.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE great commerce of every civilized &s;ociety, is that carried on between the inhabitants of the town and tho&s;e of the country. It con&s;i&s;ts in the exchange of rude for manufactured pro|duce, either immediately, or by the intervention of money, or of &s;ome &s;ort of paper which repre&s;ents money. The country &s;upplies the town with the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and the materials of ma|nufacture. The town repays this &s;upply by &s;ending back a part of the manufactured produce to the inhabitants of the country. The town, in which there neither is nor can be any reproduction of &s;ub&s;tances, may very properly be &s;aid to gain its whole wealth and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the country. We mu&s;t not, however, upon this account, imagine that the gain of the town is the lo&s;s of the country. The gains of both are mutual and reciprocal, and the divi&s;ion of labour is in this, as in all other ca&s;es, advantageous to all the different per&s;ons employed in the various occupations into which it is &s;ubdivided. The inhabitants of the country purcha&s;e of the town a greater quantity of manufactured goods, with the pro|duce of a much &s;maller quantity of their own labour, than they mu&s;t have employed had they attempted to prepare them them&s;elves. The town affords a market for the &s;urplus produce of the country,
<PB N="460" REF="471">
or what is over and above the maintenance of the cultivators, and it is there that the inhabitants of the country exchange it for &s;ome|thing el&s;e which is in demand among them. The greater the num|ber and revenue of the inhabitants of the town, the more exten&s;ive is the market which it affords to tho&s;e of the country; and the more exten&s;ive that market, it is always the more advantageous to a great number. The corn which grows within a mile of the town, &s;ells there for the &s;ame price with that which comes from twenty miles di&s;tance. But the price of the latter mu&s;t generally, not only pay the expence of rai&s;ing and bringing it to market, but afford too the ordinary profits of agriculture to the farmer. The proprietors and cultivators of the country, therefore, which lies in the neighbourhood of the town, over and above the ordinary profits of agriculture, gain, in the price of what they &s;ell, the whole value of the carriage of the like produce that is brought from more di&s;tant parts, and they &s;ave, be&s;ides, the whole value of this carriage in the price of what they buy. Compare the cultivation of the lands in the neighbourhood of any con&s;iderable town, with that of tho&s;e which lie at &s;ome di&s;tance from it, and you will ea&s;ily &s;atisfy your&s;elf how much the country is benefited by the commerce of the town. Among all the ab&s;urd &s;peculations that have been pro|pagated concerning the balance of trade, it has never been pretended that either the country lo&s;es by its commerce with the town, or the town by that with the country which maintains it.</P>
<P>As &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is, in the nature of things, prior to conveniency and luxury, &s;o the indu&s;try which procures the former, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be prior to that which mini&s;ters to the latter. The cultivation and improvement of the country, therefore, which affords &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, mu&s;t, nece&s;&s;arily, be prior to the increa&s;e of the town, which furni&s;hes only the means of conveniency and luxury. It is the &s;urplus produce of the country only, or what is over and
<PB N="461" REF="472">
above the maintenance of the cultivators, that con&s;titutes the &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence of the town, which can therefore increa&s;e only with the increa&s;e of this &s;urplus produce. The town, indeed, may not always derive its whole &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the country in its neighbourhood, or even from the territory to which it belongs, but from very di&s;tant coun|tries; and this, though it forms no exception from the general rule, has occa&s;ioned con&s;iderable variations in the progre&s;s of opulence in different ages and nations.</P>
<P>THAT order of things which nece&s;&s;ity impo&s;es in general, though not in every particular country, is, in every particular country, promoted by the natural inclinations of man. If human in&s;titu|tions had never thwarted tho&s;e natural inclinations, the towns could no where have increa&s;ed beyond what the improvement and cultivation of the territory in which they were &s;ituated could &s;up|port; till &s;uch time, at lea&s;t, as the whole of that territory was completely cultivated and improved. Upon equal, or nearly equal profits, mo&s;t men will chu&s;e to employ their capitals rather in the improvement and cultivation of land, than either in manufactures or in foreign trade. The man who employs his capital in land, has it more under his view and command, and his fortune is much le&s;s liable to accidents than that of the trader, who is obliged fre|quently to commit it, not only to the winds and the waves, but to the more uncertain elements of human folly and inju&s;tice, by giving great credits in di&s;tant countries to men, with who&s;e cha|racter and &s;ituation he can &s;eldom be thoroughly acquainted. The capital of the landlord, on the contrary, which is fixed in the improvement of his land, &s;eems to be as well &s;ecured as the nature of human affairs can admit of. The beauty of the country be&s;ides, the plea&s;ures of a country life, the tranquillity of mind which it promi&s;es, and wherever the inju&s;tice of human laws does not di&s;turb it, the independency which it really affords, have charms
<PB N="462" REF="473">
that more or le&s;s attract every body; and as to cultivate the ground was the original de&s;tination of man, &s;o in every &s;tage of his exi&s;tence he &s;eems to retain a predilection for this primitive employment.</P>
<P>WITHOUT the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome artificers, indeed, the cul|tivation of land cannot be carried on, but with great incon|veniency and continual interruption. Smiths, carpenters, wheel|wrights, and plough-wrights, ma&s;ons, and bricklayers, tanners, &s;hoemakers, and taylors, are people, who&s;e &s;ervice the farmer has frequent occa&s;ion for. Such artificers too &s;tand, occa&s;ionally, in need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one another; and as their re&s;idence is not, like that of the farmer, nece&s;&s;arily tied down to a preci&s;e &s;pot, they naturally &s;ettle in the neighbourhood of one another, and thus form a &s;mall town or village. The butcher, the brewer, and the baker, &s;oon join them, together with many other artificers and retailers, nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful for &s;upplying their occa&s;ional wants, and who contribute &s;till further to augment the town. The inhabitants of the town and tho&s;e of the country are, mutually, the &s;ervants of one another. The town is a continual fair or market, to which the inhabitants of the country re&s;ort in order to exchange their rude for manufactured produce. It is this commerce which &s;upplies the inhabitants of the town both with the materials of their work, and the means of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The quantity of the fini&s;hed work which they &s;ell to the in|habitants of the country, nece&s;&s;arily regulates the quantity of the materials and provi&s;ions which they buy. Neither their employ|ment nor &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, therefore, can augment, but in proportion to the augmentation of the demand from the country for fini&s;hed work; and this demand can augment only in proportion to the exten&s;ion of improvement and cultivation. Had human in&s;titu|tions, therefore, never di&s;turbed the natural cour&s;e of things, the
<PB N="463" REF="474">
progre&s;&s;ive wealth and increa&s;e of the towns would, in every political &s;ociety, be con&s;equential, and in proportion to the im|provement and cultivation of the territory or country.</P>
<P>IN our North American colonies, where uncultivated land is &s;till to be had upon ea&s;y terms, no manufactures for di&s;tant &s;ale have ever yet been e&s;tabli&s;hed in any of their towns. When an artificer has acquired a little more &s;tock than is nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on his own bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;upplying the neighbouring country, he does not, in North America, attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h with it a manufacture for more di&s;tant &s;ale, but employs it in the purcha&s;e and improvement of uncultivated land. From artificer he be|comes planter, and neither the large wages nor the ea&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which that country affords to artificers, can bribe him rather to work for other people than for him&s;elf. He feels that an artificer is the &s;ervant of his cu&s;tomers, from whom he derives his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; but that a planter who cultivates his own land, and derives his nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the labour of his own family, is really a ma&s;ter, and independent of all the world.</P>
<P>IN countries, on the contrary, where there is either no un|cultivated land, or none that can be had upon ea&s;y terms, every artificer who has acquired more &s;tock than he can employ in the occa&s;ional jobs of the neighbourhood, endeavours to prepare work for more di&s;tant &s;ale. The &s;mith erects &s;ome &s;ort of iron, the weaver &s;ome &s;ort of linen or woollen manufactory. Tho&s;e different manufactures come, in proce&s;s of time, to be gradually &s;ubdivided, and thereby improved and refined in a great variety of ways, which may ea&s;ily be conceived, and which it is therefore unnece&s;&s;ary to explain any further.</P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="475">
IN &s;eeking for employment to a capital, manufactures are, upon equal or nearly equal profits, naturally preferred to foreign commerce, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that agriculture is naturally preferred to manufactures. As the capital of the landlord or farmer is more &s;ecure than that of the manufacturer, &s;o the capital of the manufacturer, being at all times more within his view and command, is more &s;ecure than that of the foreign merchant. In every period, indeed, of every &s;ociety, the &s;urplus part both of the rude and manufactured produce, or that for which there is no demand at home, mu&s;t be &s;ent abroad in order to be exchanged for &s;omething for which there is &s;ome demand at home. But whether the capital, which carries this &s;urplus produce abroad, be a foreign or a dome&s;tick one, is of very little importance. If the &s;ociety has not acquired &s;ufficient capital both to cultivate all its lands, and to manufacture in the com|pleate&s;t manner the whole of their rude produce, there is even a con&s;iderable advantage that it &s;hould be exported by a foreign capital, in order that the whole &s;tock of the &s;ociety may be employed in more u&s;eful purpo&s;es. The wealth of ancient Egypt, that of China and Indo&s;tan, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate that a nation may attain a very high degree of opulence, though the greater part of its exportation trade be carried on by foreigners. The progre&s;s of our North American and We&s;t Indian colonies would have been much le&s;s rapid, had no capital but what belonged to them&s;elves been employed in exporting their &s;urplus produce.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the natural cour&s;e of things, therefore, the greater part of the capital of every growing &s;ociety is, fir&s;t, directed to agriculture, afterwards to manufactures, and la&s;t of all to foreign commerce. This order of things is &s;o very natural, that in every &s;ociety that had any territory, it has
<PB N="465" REF="476">
always, I believe, been in &s;ome degree ob&s;erved. Some of their lands mu&s;t have been cultivated before any con&s;iderable towns could be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and &s;ome &s;ort of coar&s;e indu&s;try of the manufacturing kind mu&s;t have been carried on in tho&s;e towns, before they could well think of employing them&s;elves in foreign commerce.</P>
<P>BUT though this natural order of things mu&s;t have taken place in &s;ome degree in every &s;uch &s;ociety, it has, in all the modern &s;tates of Europe, been, in many re&s;pects, intirely inverted. The foreign commerce of &s;ome of their cities has introduced all their finer manufactures, or &s;uch as were fit for di&s;tant &s;ale; and manufactures and foreign commerce together, have given birth to the principal improvements of agriculture. The manners and cu&s;toms which the nature of their original government in|troduced, and which remained after that government was greatly altered, nece&s;&s;arily forced them into this unnatural and retro|grade order.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the Di&s;couragement of Agriculture in the antient State of Europe after the Fall of the Roman Empire.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN the German and Scythian nations over-ran the we&s;tern provinces of the Roman empire, the confu&s;ions which followed &s;o great a revolution la&s;ted for &s;everal centuries. The rapine and violence which the barbarians exerci&s;ed again&s;t the antient inhabitants, interrupted the commerce between the towns and the country. The towns were de&s;erted, and the country was left uncultivated, and the we&s;tern provinces of Europe, which had enjoyed a con&s;iderable degree of opulence under the Roman empire, &s;unk into the lowe&s;t &s;tate of poverty and barbari&s;m. During the continuance of tho&s;e confu&s;ions, the chiefs and princi|pal leaders of tho&s;e nations, acquired or u&s;urped to them&s;elves the greater part of the lands of tho&s;e countries. A great part of them was uncultivated; but no part of them, whether cultivated or uncultivated, was left without a proprietor. All of them were engro&s;&s;ed, and the greater part by a few great proprietors.</P>
<P>THIS original engro&s;&s;ing of uncultivated lands, though a great, might have been but a tran&s;itory evil. They might &s;oon have been divided again, and broke into &s;mall parcels either by &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion or by alienation. The law of primogeniture hindered them from being divided by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: the introduction of entails pre|vented their being broke into &s;mall parcels by alienation.</P>
<P>WHEN land, like moveables, is con&s;idered as the means only of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and enjoyment, the natural law of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion divides
<PB N="467" REF="478">
it, like them, among all the children of the family; of all of whom the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and enjoyment may be &s;uppo&s;ed equally dear to the father. This natural law of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion accordingly took place among the Romans, who made no more di&s;tinction between elder and younger, between male and female, in the inheritance of lands, than we do in the di&s;tribution of moveables. But when land was con&s;idered as the means, not of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence merely, but of power and protection, it was thought better that it &s;hould de&s;cend undivided to one. In tho&s;e di&s;orderly times, every great landlord was a &s;ort of petty prince. His tenants were his &s;ubjects. He was their judge, and in &s;ome re&s;pects their legi&s;lator in peace, and their leader in war. He made war according to his own di&s;cretion, frequently again&s;t his neighbours, and &s;ometimes again&s;t his &s;ove|reign. The &s;ecurity of a landed e&s;tate, therefore, the protection which its owner could afford to tho&s;e who dwelt on it, depended upon its greatne&s;s. To divide it was to ruin it, and to expo&s;e every part of it to be oppre&s;&s;ed and &s;wallowed up by the incur&s;ions of its neighbours. The law of primogeniture, therefore, came to take place, not immediately, indeed, but in proce&s;s of time, in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of landed e&s;tates, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that it has generally taken place in that of monarchies, though not always at their fir&s;t in&s;titution. That the power, and con&s;equently the &s;ecu|rity of the monarchy, may not be weakened by divi&s;ion, it mu&s;t de&s;cend entire to one of the children. To which of them &s;o im|portant a preference &s;hall be given, mu&s;t be determined by &s;ome general rule, founded not upon the doubtful di&s;tinctions of per|&s;onal merit, but upon &s;ome plain and evident difference which can admit of no di&s;pute. Among the children of the &s;ame family, there can be no indi&s;putable difference but that of &s;cx, and that of age. The male &s;ex is univer&s;ally preferred to the female; and when all other things are equal, the elder every where takes place
<PB N="468" REF="479">
of the younger. Hence the origin of the right of primogeniture, and of what is called lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>LAWS frequently continue in force long after the circum&s;tances, which fir&s;t gave occa&s;ion to them, and which could alone render them rea&s;onable, are no more. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Europe, the proprietor of a &s;ingle acre of land is as perfectly &s;ecure of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as the proprietor of a hundred thou&s;and. The right of primogeniture, however, &s;till continues to be re&s;pected, and as of all in&s;titutions it is the fitte&s;t to &s;upport the pride of family di&s;tinctions, it is &s;till likely to endure for many centuries. In every other re&s;pect, nothing can be more contrary to the real in|tere&s;t of a numerous family, than a right which, in order to enrich one, beggars all the re&s;t of the children.</P>
<P>ENTAILS are the natural con&s;equences of the law of primo|geniture. They were introduced to pre&s;erve a certain lineal &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, of which the law of primogeniture fir&s;t gave the idea, and to hinder any part of the original e&s;tate from being carried out of the propo&s;ed line either by gift, or devi&s;e, or alienation; either by the folly, or by the misfortune of any of its &s;ucce&s;&s;ive owners. They were altogether unknown to the Romans. Neither their &s;ub&s;titutions nor fideicommi&s;&s;es bear any re&s;emblance to entails, though &s;ome French lawyers have thought proper to dre&s;s the modern in&s;titution in the language and form of tho&s;e antient ones.</P>
<P>WHEN great landed e&s;tates were a &s;ort of principalities, entails might not be unrea&s;onable. Like what are called the fundamental laws of &s;ome monarchies, they might frequently hinder the &s;ecurity of thou&s;ands from being endangered by the caprice or extravagance of one man. But in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Europe, when &s;mall as
<PB N="469" REF="480">
well as great e&s;tates derive their &s;ecurity from the laws of their country, nothing can be more compleatly ab&s;urd. They are founded upon the mo&s;t ab&s;urd of all &s;uppo&s;itions, the &s;uppo&s;ition that every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generation of men have not an equal right to the earth, and to all that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; but that the property of the pre&s;ent generation &s;hould be re&s;trained and regulated according to the fancy of tho&s;e who died perhaps five hundred years ago. Entails, however, are &s;till re&s;pected through the greater part of Europe, in tho&s;e countries particularly in which noble birth is a nece&s;&s;ary qualification for the enjoyment either of civil or military honours. Entails are thought nece&s;&s;ary for maintaining this ex|clu&s;ive privilege of the nobility to the great offices and honours of their country; and that order having u&s;urped one unju&s;t ad|vantage over the re&s;t of their fellow citizens, left their poverty &s;hould render it ridiculous, it is thought rea&s;onable that they &s;hould have another. The common law of England, indeed, is &s;aid to abhor perpetuities, and they are accordingly more re&s;tricted there than in any other European monarchy; though even England is not altogether without them. In Scotland more than one-fifth, perhaps more than one-third part of the whole lands of the country, are at pre&s;ent under &s;trict entail.</P>
<P>GREAT tracts of uncultivated land were, in this manner, not only engro&s;&s;ed by particular families, but the po&s;&s;ibility of their being divided again was as much as po&s;&s;ible precluded forever. It &s;eldom happens, however, that a great proprietor is a great improver. In the di&s;orderly times which gave birth to tho&s;e bar|barous in&s;titutions, the great proprietor was &s;ufficiently employed in defending his own territories, or in extending his juri&s;diction and authority over tho&s;e of his neighbours. He had no lei&s;ure to attend to the cultivation and improvement of land. When the e&s;tabli&s;hment of law and order afforded him this lei&s;ure, he often wanted the inclination, and almo&s;t always the requi&s;ite abilities. If
<PB N="470" REF="481">
the expence of his hou&s;e and per&s;on either equalled or exceeded his revenue, as it did very frequently, he had no &s;tock to employ in this manner. If he was an oeconomi&s;t, he generally found it more profitable to employ his annual &s;avings in new purcha&s;es, than in the improvement of his old e&s;tate. To im|prove land with profit, like all other commercial projects, re|quires an exact attention to &s;mall &s;avings and &s;mall gains, of which a man born to a great fortune, even though naturally frugal, is very &s;eldom capable. The &s;ituation of &s;uch a per&s;on naturally di&s;po&s;es him to attend rather to ornament which plea&s;es his fancy, than to profit for which he has &s;o little occa&s;ion. The elegance of his dre&s;s, of his equipage, of his hou&s;e, and hou&s;hold furniture, are objects which from his infancy he has been accu&s;tomed to have &s;ome anxiety about. The turn of mind which this habit natu|rally forms, follows him when he comes to think of the improve|ment of land. He embelli&s;hes perhaps four or five hundred acres in the neighbourhood of his hou&s;e, at ten times the expence which the land is worth after all his improvements; and finds that if he was to improve his whole e&s;tate in the &s;ame manner, and he has little ta&s;te for any other, he would be a bankrupt before he had fini&s;hed the tenth part of it. There &s;till remain in both parts of the united kingdom &s;ome great e&s;tates which have continued without interruption in the hands of the &s;ame family &s;ince the times of feudal anarchy. Compare the pre&s;ent condition of tho&s;e e&s;tates with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the &s;mall proprietors in their neigh|bourhood, and you will require no other argument to convince you how unfavourable &s;uch exten&s;ive property is to improve|ment.</P>
<P>IF little improvement was to be expected from &s;uch great pro|prietors, &s;till le&s;s was to be hoped for from tho&s;e who occupied the land under them. In the antient &s;tate of Europe, the occupiers of land were all tenants at will. They were all or almo&s;t all &s;laves;
<PB N="471" REF="482">
but their &s;lavery was of a milder kind than that known among the antient Greeks and Romans, or even in our We&s;t Indian colo|nies. They were &s;uppo&s;ed to belong more directly to the land than to their ma&s;ter. They could, therefore, be &s;old with it, but not &s;eparately. They could marry, provided it was with the con&s;ent of their ma&s;ter; and he could not afterwards di&s;&s;olve the marriage by &s;elling the man and wife to different per&s;ons. If he maimed or murdered any of them, he was liable to &s;ome penalty, though generally but to a &s;mall one. They were not, however, capable of acquiring property. Whatever they acquired was ac|quired to their ma&s;ter, and he could take it from them at plea&s;ure. Whatever cultivation and improvement could be carried on by means of &s;uch &s;laves, was properly carried on by their ma&s;ter. It was at his expence. The &s;eed, the cattle, and the in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry were all his. It was for his benefit. Such &s;laves could acquire nothing but their daily maintenance. It was properly the proprietor him&s;elf, therefore, that, in this ca&s;e, occupied his own lands, and cultivated them by his own bondmen. This &s;pecies of &s;lavery &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in Ru&s;&s;ia, Poland, Hungary, Bohemia, Mo|ravia, and other parts of Germany. It is only in the we&s;tern and &s;outh-we&s;tern provinces of Europe, that it has gradually been aboli&s;hed altogether.</P>
<P>BUT if great improvements are &s;eldom to be expected from great proprietors, they are lea&s;t of all to be expected when they employ &s;laves for their workmen. The experience of all ages and nations, I believe, demon&s;trates that the work done by &s;laves, though it appears to co&s;t only their maintenance, is in the end the deare&s;t of any. A per&s;on who can acquire no property, can have no other intere&s;t but to eat as much, and to labour as little as po&s;|&s;ible. Whatever work he does beyond what is &s;ufficient to pur|cha&s;e his own maintenance, can be &s;queezed out of him by vio|lence only, and not by any intere&s;t of his own. In antient Italy,
<PB N="472" REF="483">
how much the cultivation of corn degenerated, how unprofitable it became to the ma&s;ter when it fell under the management of &s;laves, is remarked by both Pliny and Columella. In the time of Ari&s;totle it had not been much better in antient Greece. Speak|ing of the ideal republic de&s;cribed in the laws of Plato, to main|tain five thou&s;and idle men (the number of warriors &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ary for its defence) together with their women and &s;ervants, would require, he &s;ays, a territory of boundle&s;s extent and fertility, like the plains of Babylon.</P>
<P>THE pride of man makes him love to domineer, and nothing mortifies him &s;o much as to be obliged to conde&s;cend to per&s;uade his inferiors. Wherever the law allows it, and the nature of the work can afford it, therefore, he will generally prefer the &s;ervice of &s;laves to that of freemen. The planting of &s;ugar and tobacco can afford the expence of &s;lave-cultivation. The rai&s;ing of corn, it &s;eems, in the pre&s;ent times, cannot. In the Engli&s;h colonies, of which the principal produce is corn, the far greater part of the work is done by freemen. The late re&s;olution of the quakers in Pen&s;yl|vania to &s;et at liberty all their negroe &s;laves, may &s;atisfy us that their number cannot be very great. Had they made any con&s;iderable part of their property, &s;uch a re&s;olution could never have been agreed to. In our &s;ugar colonies, on the contrary, the whole work is done by &s;laves, and in our tobacco colonies a very great part of it. The profits of a &s;ugar-plantation in any of our We&s;t Indian colonies are generally much greater than tho&s;e of any other cul|tivation that is known either in Europe or America: And the profits of a tobacco plantation, though inferior to tho&s;e of &s;ugar, are &s;uperior to tho&s;e of corn, as has already been ob&s;erved. Both can afford the expence of &s;lave-cultivation, but &s;ugar can afford it &s;till better than tobacco. The number of negroes accordingly is much greater, in proportion to that of whites, in our &s;ugar than in our tobacco colonies.</P>
<P><PB N="473" REF="484">
TO the &s;lave cultivators of antient times, gradually &s;ucceeded a &s;pecies of farmers known at pre&s;ent in France by the name of Metayers. They are called in Latin Coloni Partiarii. They have been &s;o long in di&s;u&s;e in England that at pre&s;ent I know no Engli&s;h name for them. The proprietor furni&s;hed them with the &s;eed, cattle, and in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry, the whole &s;tock, in &s;hort, nece&s;&s;ary for cultivating the farm. The produce was divided equally between the proprietor and the farmer, after &s;etting a&s;ide what was judged nece&s;&s;ary for keeping up the &s;tock, which was re|&s;tored to the proprietor when the farmer either quitted or was turned out of the farm.</P>
<P>LAND occupied by &s;uch tenants is properly cultivated at the expence of the proprietor, as much as that occupied by &s;laves. There is, however, one very e&s;&s;ential difference between them. Such tenants, being freemen, are capable of acquiring property, and having a certain proportion of the produce of the land, they have a plain intere&s;t that the whole produce &s;hould be as great as po&s;&s;ible, in order that their own proportion may be &s;o. A &s;lave, on the contrary, who can acquire nothing but his maintenance, con&s;ults his own ea&s;e by making the land produce as little as po&s;|&s;ible, over and above that maintenance. It is probable that it was partly upon account of this advantage, and partly upon account of the encroachments which the &s;overeign, always jealous of the great lords, gradually encouraged their villains to make upon their authority, and which &s;eem at la&s;t to have been &s;uch as rendered this &s;pecies of &s;ervitude altogether inconvenient, that tenure in villanage gradually wore out through the greater part of Europe. The time and manner, however, in which &s;o important a revo|lution was brought about, is one of the mo&s;t ob&s;cure points in modern hi&s;tory. The church of Rome claims great merit in it; and it is certain that &s;o early as the twelfth century, Alexander III.
<PB N="474" REF="485">
publi&s;hed a bull for the general emancipation of &s;laves. It &s;eems, however, to have been rather a pious exhortation, than a law to which exact obedience was required from the faithful. Slavery continued to take place almo&s;t univer&s;ally for &s;everal centuries after|wards, till it was gradually aboli&s;hed by the joint operation of the two intere&s;ts above mentioned, that of the proprietor on the one hand, and that of the &s;overeign on the other. A villain enfran|chi&s;ed, and at the &s;ame time allowed to continue in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land, having no &s;tock of his own, could cultivate it only by means of what the landlord advanced to him, and mu&s;t, therefore, have been what the French call a Metayer.</P>
<P>IT could never, however, be the intere&s;t even of this la&s;t &s;pecies of cultivators to lay out in the further improvement of the land, any part of the little &s;tock which they might &s;ave from their own &s;hare of the produce, becau&s;e the lord, who laid out nothing, was to get one-half of whatever it produced. The tithe, which is but a tenth of the produce, is found to be a very great hinderance to improvement. A tax, therefore, which amounted to one half, mu&s;t have been an effectual bar to it. It might be the intere&s;t of a metayer to make the land produce as much as could be brought out of it by means of the &s;tock furni&s;hed by the proprietor: but it could never be his intere&s;t to mix any part of his own with it. In France, where five parts out of &s;ix of the whole kingdom are &s;aid to be &s;till occupied by this &s;pecies of cultivators, the pro|prietors complain that their metayers take every opportunity of employing the ma&s;ters cattle rather in carriage than in cultivation; becau&s;e in the one ca&s;e they get the whole profits to them&s;elves, in the other they &s;hare them with their landlord. This &s;pecies of tenants &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in &s;ome parts of Scotland. They are called &s;teel-bow tenants. Tho&s;e antient Engli&s;h tenants, who are &s;aid by chief Baron Gilbert and Doctor Black&s;tone to have been rather
<PB N="475" REF="486">
bailiffs of the landlord than farmers properly &s;o called, were pro|bably of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>TO this &s;pecies of tenancy &s;ucceeded, though by very &s;low degrees, farmers properly &s;o called, who cultivated the land with their own &s;tock, paying a rent certain to the landlord. When &s;uch farmers have a lea&s;e for a term of years, they may &s;ometimes find it for their intere&s;t to lay out part of their capital in the further improvement of the farm; becau&s;e they may &s;ometimes expect to recover it, with a large profit, before the expiration of the lea&s;e. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion even of &s;uch farmers, however, was long extreamly precarious, and &s;till is &s;o in many parts of Europe. They could before the expiration of their term be legally outed of their lea&s;e, by a new purcha&s;er; in England, even by the fictitious action of a common recovery. If they were turned out illegally by the violence of their ma&s;ter, the action by which they obtained redre&s;s was ex|treamly imperfect. It did not always re-in&s;tate them in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land, but gave them damages which never amounted to the real lo&s;s. Even in England, the country perhaps of Europe where the yeomanry has always been mo&s;t re&s;pected, it was not till about the 14th of Henry the VIIth that the action of ejectment was invented, by which the tenant recovers, not damages only but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and in which his claim is not nece&s;&s;arily concluded by the uncertain deci&s;ion of a &s;ingle a&s;&s;ize. This action has been found &s;o effectual a remedy that, in the modern practice, when the landlord has occa&s;ion to &s;ue for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land, he &s;eldom makes u&s;e of the actions which properly belong to him as landlord, the writ of right or the writ of entry, but &s;ues in the name of his tenant, by the writ of ejectment. In England, therefore, the &s;ecurity of the tenant is equal to that of the proprietor. In England be&s;ides a lea&s;e for life of forty &s;hillings a year value is a freehold, and entitles the le&s;&s;ee to vote for a member of parliament;
<PB N="476" REF="487">
and as a great part of the yeomanry have freeholds of this kind, the whole order becomes re&s;pectable to their landlords on account of the political con&s;ideration which this gives them. There is, I believe, nowhere in Europe, except in England, any in&s;tance of the tenant building upon the land of which he had no lea&s;e, and tru&s;ting that the honour of his landlord would take no advantage of &s;o important an improvement. Tho&s;e laws and cu&s;toms &s;o favourable to the yeomanry, have perhaps contributed more to the pre&s;ent grandeur of England than all their boa&s;ted regulations of commerce taken together.</P>
<P>THE law which &s;ecures the longe&s;t lea&s;es again&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of every kind is, &s;o far as I know, peculiar to Great Britain. It was introduced into Scotland &s;o early as 1449, by a law of James the IId. Its beneficial influence, however, has been much ob&s;tructed by entails; the heirs of entail being generally re&s;trained from letting lea&s;es for any long term of years, frequently for more than one year. A late act of parliament has, in this re&s;pect, &s;omewhat flackened their &s;etters, though they are &s;till by much too &s;trait. In Scotland, be&s;ides, as no lea&s;ehold gives a vote for a member of parliament, the yeomanry are upon this account le&s;s re&s;pectable to their landlords than in England.</P>
<P>IN other parts of Europe, after it was found convenient to &s;ecure tenants both again&s;t heirs and purcha&s;ers, the term of their &s;ecurity was &s;till limited to a very &s;hort period; in France, for example, to nine years from the commencement of the lea&s;e. It has in that country, indeed, been lately extended to twenty &s;even, a period &s;till too &s;hort to encourage the tenant to make the mo&s;t important improvements. The proprietors of land were antiently the legi&s;|lators of every part of Europe. The laws relating to land, there|fore, were all calculated for what they &s;uppo&s;ed the intere&s;t of the proprietor. It was for his intere&s;t, they had imagined, that no
<PB N="477" REF="488">
lea&s;e granted by any of his predece&s;&s;ors &s;hould hinder him from enjoying, during a long term of years, the full value of his land. Avarice and inju&s;tice are always &s;hort-&s;ighted, and they did not fore&s;ee how much this regulation mu&s;t ob&s;truct improvement, and thereby hurt in the long run the real intere&s;t of the landlord.</P>
<P>THE farmers too, be&s;ides paying the rent, were antiently, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, bound to perform a great number of &s;ervices to the landlord, which were &s;eldom either &s;pecified in the lea&s;e, or regulated by any preci&s;e rule, but by the u&s;e and wont of the manor or barony. The&s;e &s;ervices, therefore, being almo&s;t en|tirely arbitrary, &s;ubjected the tenant to many vexations. In Scot|land the abolition of all &s;ervices, not preci&s;ely &s;tipulated in the lea&s;e, has in the cour&s;e of a few years very much altered for the better the condition of the yeomanry of that country.</P>
<P>THE publick &s;ervices to which the yeomanry were bound, were not le&s;s arbitrary than the private ones. To make and maintain the high roads, a &s;ervitude which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, I believe, every where, though with different degrees of oppre&s;&s;ion in different countries, was not the only one. When the king's troops, when his hou&s;hold or his officers of any kind pa&s;&s;ed through any part of the country, the yeomanry were bound to provide them with hor&s;es, carriages, and provi&s;ions, at a price regulated by the purveyor. Great Britain is, I believe, the only monarchy in Europe where the oppre&s;&s;ion of purveyance has been entirely aboli&s;hed. It &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in France and Germany.</P>
<P>THE publick taxes to which they were &s;ubject were as irregular and oppre&s;&s;ive as the &s;ervices. The antient lords, though extreamly unwilling to grant them&s;elves any pecuniary aid to their &s;overeign, ea&s;ily allowed him to tallage, as they called it, their tenants, and
<PB N="478" REF="489">
had not knowledge enough to fore&s;ee how much this mu&s;t in the end affect their own revenue. The taille, as it &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in France, may &s;erve as an example of tho&s;e antient tallages. It is a tax upon the &s;uppo&s;ed profits of the farmer, which they e&s;timate by the &s;tock that he has upon the farm. It is his intere&s;t, therefore, to appear to have as little as po&s;&s;ible, and con&s;equently to employ as little as po&s;&s;ible in its cultivation, and none in its improvement. Should any &s;tock happen to accumulate in the hands of a French farmer, the taille is almo&s;t equal to a prohibition of its ever being employed upon the land. This tax be&s;ides is &s;uppo&s;ed to di&s;honour whoever is &s;ubject to it, and to degrade him below, not only the rank of a gentleman, but that of a burgher, and whoever rents the lands of another becomes &s;ubject to it. No gentleman nor even any burgher that has &s;tock will &s;ubmit to this degradation. This tax, therefore, not only hinders the &s;tock which accumulates upon the land from being employed in its improvement, but drives away all other &s;tock from it. The antient tenths and fifteenths, &s;o u&s;ual in England in former times, &s;eem, &s;o far as they affected the land, to have been taxes of the &s;ame nature with the taille.</P>
<P>UNDER all the&s;e di&s;couragements, little improvement could be expected from the occupiers of land. That order of people, with all the liberty and &s;ecurity which law can give, mu&s;t always improve under great di&s;advantages. The farmer compared with the pro|prietor, is as a merchant who trades with borrowed money com|pared with one who trades with his own. The &s;tock of both may improve, but that of the one, with only equal good conduct, mu&s;t always improve more &s;lowly than that of the other, on account of the large &s;hare of the profits which is con&s;umed by the intere&s;t of the loan. The lands cultivated by the farmer mu&s;t, in the &s;ame manner, with only equal good conduct, be improved more &s;lowly than tho&s;e cultivated by the proprietor; on account of the large
<PB N="479" REF="490">
&s;hare of the produce which is con&s;umed in the rent, and which, had the farmer been proprietor, he might have employed in the further improvement of the land. The &s;tation of a farmer be&s;ides is, from the nature of things, inferior to that of a proprietor. Through the greater part of Europe the yeomanry are regarded as an infe|rior rank of people, even to the better &s;ort of trade&s;men and mechanics, and in all parts of Europe to the great merchants and ma&s;ter manufacturers. It can &s;eldom happen, therefore, that a man of any con&s;iderable &s;tock &s;hould quit the &s;uperior in order to place him&s;elf in an inferior &s;tation. Even in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Europe, therefore, little &s;tock is likely to go from any other pro|fe&s;&s;ion to the improvement of land in the way of farming. More does perhaps in Great Britain than in any other country, though even there the great &s;tocks which are, in &s;ome places, employed in farming, have generally been acquired by farming, the trade, perhaps, in which of all others &s;tock is commonly acquired mo&s;t &s;lowly. After &s;mall proprietors, however, rich and great far|mers are, in every country, the principal improvers. There are more &s;uch perhaps in England than in any other European monarchy. In the republican governments of Holland and of Berne in Switzerland, the farmers are &s;aid to be not inferior to tho&s;e of England.</P>
<P>THE antient policy of Europe was, over and above all this, unfavourable to the improvement and cultivation of land, whether carried on by the proprietor or by the farmer; fir&s;t, by the general prohibition of the exportation of corn without a &s;pecial licence, which &s;eems to have been a very univer&s;al regulation; and &s;econdly, by the re&s;traints which were laid upon the inland commerce, not only of corn but of almo&s;t every other part of the produce of the farm, by the ab&s;urd laws again&s;t engro&s;&s;ers, regrators, and fore|&s;tallers, and by the privileges of fairs and markets. It has already
<PB N="480" REF="491">
been ob&s;erved in what manner the prohibition of the exportation of corn, together with &s;ome encouragement given to the importation of foreign corn, ob&s;tructed the cultivation of antient Italy, naturally the mo&s;t fertile country in Europe, and at that time the &s;eat of the greate&s;t empire in the world. To what degree &s;uch re&s;traints upon the inland commerce of this commodity, joined to the gene|ral prohibition of exportation, mu&s;t have di&s;couraged the cul|tivation of countries le&s;s fertile, and le&s;s favourably circum&s;tanced, it is not perhaps very ea&s;y to imagine.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of Cities and Towns, after the Fall of the Roman Empire.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE inhabitants of cities and towns were, after the fall of the Roman empire, not more favoured than tho&s;e of the country. They con&s;i&s;ted, indeed, of a very different order of people from the fir&s;t inhabitants of the antient republicks of Greece and Italy. The&s;e la&s;t were compo&s;ed chiefly of the proprietors of lands, among whom the publick territory was originally divided, and who found it convenient to build their hou&s;es in the neigh|bourhood of one another, and to &s;urround them with a wall, for the &s;ake of common defence. After the fall of the Roman empire, on the contrary, the proprietors of lands &s;eem generally to have lived in fortified ca&s;tles on their own e&s;tates, and in the mid&s;t of their own tenants and dependants. The towns were chiefly inha|bited by trade&s;men and mechanicks, who &s;eem in tho&s;e days to have been of &s;ervile, or very nearly of &s;ervile condition. The pri|vileges
<PB N="481" REF="492">
which we find granted by antient charters to the inhabitants of &s;ome of the principal towns in Europe, &s;ufficiently &s;how what they were before tho&s;e grants. The people to whom it is granted as a privilege, that they might give away their own daughters in marriage without the con&s;ent of their lord, that upon their death their own children, and not their lord, &s;hould &s;ucceed to their goods, and that they might di&s;po&s;e of their own effects by will, mu&s;t, before tho&s;e grants, have been either altogether, or very nearly in the &s;ame &s;tate of villanage with the occupiers of land in the country.</P>
<P>THEY &s;eem, indeed, to have been a very poor, mean &s;ett of people, who u&s;ed to travel about with their goods from place to place, and from fair to fair, like the hawkers and pedlars of the pre|&s;ent times. In all the different countries of Europe then, in the &s;ame manner as in &s;everal of the Tartar governments of A&s;ia at pre&s;ent, taxes u&s;ed to be levied upon the per&s;ons and goods of travellers, when they pa&s;&s;ed through certain manors, when they went over certain bridges, when they carried about their goods from place to place in a fair, when they erected in it a booth or &s;tall to &s;ell them in. The&s;e different taxes were known in England by the names of pa&s;&s;age, pontage, la&s;tage, and &s;tallage. Sometimes the king, &s;ometimes a great lord, who had, it &s;eems, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, authority to do this, would grant to particular traders, to &s;uch particularly as lived in their own deme&s;nes, a general exemption from &s;uch taxes. Such traders, though in other re&s;pects of &s;er|vile, or very nearly of &s;ervile condition, were upon this account called Free-traders. They in return u&s;ually paid to their pro|tector a &s;ort of annual poll-tax. In tho&s;e days protection was &s;eldom granted without a valuable con&s;ideration, and this tax might, perhaps, be con&s;idered as compen&s;ation for what their patrons might lo&s;e by their exemption from other taxes. At fir&s;t,
<PB N="482" REF="493">
both tho&s;e poll-taxes and tho&s;e exemptions &s;eem to have been altogether per&s;onal, and to have affected only particular indivi|duals, during either their lives, or the plea&s;ure of their protectors. In the very imperfect accounts which have been publi&s;hed from Dome&s;day-book, of &s;everal of the towns of England, mention is frequently made, &s;ometimes of the tax which particular burghers paid, each of them, either to the king, or to &s;ome other great lord, for this &s;ort of protection, and &s;ometimes of the general amount only of all tho&s;e taxes.</P>
<P>BUT how &s;ervile &s;oever may have been originally the condition of the inhabitants of towns, it appears evidently, that they arrived at liberty and independency much earlier than the occupiers of land in the country. That part of the king's revenue which aro&s;e from &s;uch poll-taxes in any particular town, u&s;ed commonly to be lett in farm, during a term of years for a rent certain, &s;ome|times to the &s;heriff of the county, and &s;ometimes to other per&s;ons. The burghers them&s;elves frequently got credit enough to be admitted to farm the revenues of this &s;ort which aro&s;e out of their own town, they becoming jointly and &s;everally an|&s;werable for the whole rent. To lett a farm in this manner was quite agreeable to the u&s;ual oeconomy of, I believe, the &s;overeigns of all the different countries of Europe; who u&s;ed frequently to lett whole manors to all the tenants of tho&s;e manors, they be|coming jointly and &s;everally an&s;werable for the whole rent; but in return being allowed to collect it in their own way, and to pay it into the king's exchequer by the hands of their own bailiff, and being thus altogether freed from the in&s;olence of the king's officers; a circum&s;tance in tho&s;e days regarded as of the greate&s;t impor|tance.</P>
<P><PB N="483" REF="494">
AT fir&s;t, the farm of the town was probably lett to the burghers, in the &s;ame manner as it had been to other farmers, for a term of years only. In proce&s;s of time, however, it &s;eems to have be|come the general practice to grant it to them in fee, that is forever, re&s;erving a rent certain never afterwards to be augmented. The payment having thus become perpetual, the exemptions, in return for which it was made, naturally became perpetual too. Tho&s;e exemptions, therefore, cea&s;ed to be per&s;onal, and could not after|wards be con&s;idered as belonging to individuals as individuals, but as burghers of a particular burgh, which, upon this account, was called a Free-burgh, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that they had been called Free-burghers or Free-traders.</P>
<P>ALONG with this grant, the important privileges above men|tioned, that they might give away their own daughters in marriage, that their children &s;hould &s;ucceed to them, and that they might di&s;po&s;e of their own effects by will, were generally be&s;towed upon the burghers of the town to whom it was given. Whether &s;uch privileges had before been u&s;ually granted along with the freedom of trade, to particular burghers, as individuals, I know not. I reckon it not improbable that they were, though I cannot produce any direct evidence of it. But however this may have been, the principal attributes of villanage and &s;lavery being thus taken away from them, they now, at lea&s;t, became really free in our pre&s;ent &s;en&s;e of the word Freedom.</P>
<P>NOR was this all. They were generally at the &s;ame time erected into a commonality or corporation, with the privilege of having magi&s;trates and a town council of their own, of making bye laws for their own government, of building walls for their own defence, and of reducing all their inhabitants under a &s;ort of military di&s;cipline, by obliging them to watch and ward, that is,
<PB N="484" REF="495">
as antiently under&s;tood, to guard and defend tho&s;e walls again&s;t all attacks and &s;urpri&s;es by night as well as by day. In England they were generally exempted from &s;uit to the hundred and county courts; and all &s;uch pleas as &s;hould ari&s;e among them, the pleas of the crown excepted, were left to the deci&s;ion of their own magi&s;trates. In other countries much greater and more exten&s;ive juri&s;dictions were frequently granted to them.</P>
<P>IT might, probably, be nece&s;&s;ary to grant to &s;uch towns as were admitted to farm their own revenues, &s;ome &s;ort of compul&s;ive juri&s;diction to oblige their own citizens to make payment. In tho&s;e di&s;orderly times it might have been extremely inconvenient to have left them to &s;eek this &s;ort of ju&s;tice from any other tribunal. But it mu&s;t &s;eem extraordinary that the &s;overeigns of all the different countries of Europe, &s;hould have exchanged in this manner for a rent certain, never more to be augmented, that branch of their revenue, which was, perhaps, of all others the mo&s;t likely to be improved, by the natural cour&s;e of things, without either ex|pence or attention of their own: and that they &s;hould, be&s;ides, have in this manner voluntarily erected a &s;ort of independent republicks in the heart of their own dominions.</P>
<P>IN order to under&s;tand this it mu&s;t be remembered, that in tho&s;e days the &s;overeign of perhaps no country in Europe, was able to protect, through the whole extent of his dominions, the weaker part of his &s;ubjects from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the great lords. Tho&s;e whom the law could not protect, and who were not &s;trong enough to defend them&s;elves, were obliged either to have recour&s;e to the protection of &s;ome great lord, and in order to obtain it to become either his &s;laves or va&s;&s;als; or to enter into a league of mutual defence for the common protection of one another. The inhabitants of cities and burghs, con&s;idered as &s;ingle indi|viduals,
<PB N="485" REF="496">
had no power to defend them&s;elves: but by entering into a league of mutual defence with their neighbours, they were capable of making no contemptible re&s;i&s;tance. The lords de&s;pi&s;ed the burghers, whom they con&s;idered not only as of a different order, but as a parcel of emancipated &s;laves, almo&s;t of a different &s;pecies from them&s;elves. The wealth of the burghers never failed to provoke their envy and indignation, and they plundered them upon every occa&s;ion without mercy or remor&s;e. The burghers naturally hated and feared the lords. The king hated and feared them too; but though perhaps he might de&s;pi&s;e, he had no rea&s;on either to hate or fear the burghers. Mutual intere&s;t, therefore, di&s;po&s;ed them to &s;upport the king, and the king to &s;upport them again&s;t the lords. They were the enemies of his enemies, and it was his intere&s;t to render them as &s;ecure and independent of tho&s;e enemies as he could. By granting them magi&s;trates of their own, the privilege of making bye-laws for their own government, that of building walls for their own defence, and that of reducing all their inhabitants under a &s;ort of military di&s;cipline, he gave them all the means of &s;ecurity and independency of the barons which it was in his power to be&s;tow. Without the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ome regular government of this kind, without &s;ome authority to compel their inhabitants to act according to &s;ome certain plan or &s;y&s;tem, no voluntary league of mutual defence could either have afforded them any permanent &s;ecurity, or have enabled them to give the king any con&s;iderable &s;upport. By granting them the farm of their town in fee, he took away from tho&s;e whom he wi&s;hed to have for his friends, and, if one may &s;ay &s;o, for his allies, all ground of jea|lou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion that he was ever afterwards to oppre&s;s them, either by rai&s;ing the farm rent of their town, or by granting it to &s;ome other farmer.</P>
<P>THE princes who lived upon the wor&s;t terms with their barons, &s;eem accordingly to have been the mo&s;t liberal in grants of this
<PB N="486" REF="497">
kind to their burghs. King John of England, for example, appears to have been a mo&s;t munificent benefactor to his towns. Philip the fir&s;t of France lo&s;t all authority over his barons. Towards the end of his reign, his &s;on Lewis, known afterwards by the name of Lewis the Fat, con&s;ulted, according to father Daniel, with the bi&s;hops of the royal deme&s;nes, concerning the mo&s;t proper means of re&s;training the violence of the great lords. Their advice con|&s;i&s;ted of two different propo&s;als. One was to erect a new order of juri&s;diction, by e&s;tabli&s;hing magi&s;trates and a town council in every con&s;iderable town of his deme&s;nes. The other was to form a new militia, by making the inhabitants of tho&s;e towns, under the com|mand of their own magi&s;trates, march out upon proper occa&s;ions to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the king. It is from this period, according to the French antiquarians, that we are to date the in&s;titution of the magi&s;trates and councils of cities in France. It was during the unpro&s;perous reigns of the princes of the hou&s;e of Suabia that the greater part of the free towns of Germany received the fir&s;t grants of their privileges, and that the famous Han&s;eatic league fir&s;t became formidable.</P>
<P>THE militia of the cities &s;eems, in tho&s;e times, not to have been inferior to that of the country, and as they could be more readily a&s;&s;embled upon any &s;udden occa&s;ion, they frequently had the ad|vantage in their di&s;putes with the neighbouring lords. In coun|tries, &s;uch as Italy and Switzerland, in which, on account either of their di&s;tance from the principal &s;eat of government, of the natural &s;trength of the country it&s;elf, or of &s;ome other rea&s;on, the &s;overeign came to lo&s;e the whole of his authority, the cities generally became independent republicks, and conquered all the nobility in their neighbourhood; obliging them to pull down their ca&s;tles in the country, and to live, like other peaceable inhabitants, in the city. This is the &s;hort hi&s;tory of the republick of Berne, as well as
<PB N="487" REF="498">
of &s;everal other cities in Switzerland. If you except Venice, for of that city the hi&s;tory is &s;omewhat different, it is the hi&s;tory of all the con&s;iderable Italian republicks, of which &s;o great a number aro&s;e and peri&s;hed, between the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century.</P>
<P>IN countries &s;uch as France or England, where the authority of the &s;overeign, though frequently very low, never was de&s;troyed altogether, the cities had no opportunity of becoming entirely in|dependent. They became, however, &s;o con&s;iderable that the &s;ove|reign could impo&s;e no tax upon them, be&s;ides the &s;tated farm rent of the town, without their own con&s;ent. They were, therefore, called upon to &s;end deputies to the general a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates of the kingdom, where they might join with the clergy and the barons in granting, upon urgent occa&s;ions, &s;ome extraordinary aid to the king. Being generally too more favourable to his power, their deputies &s;eem, &s;ometimes, to have been employed by him as a counter-balance to the authority of the great lords in tho&s;e a&s;&s;em|blies. Hence the origin of the repre&s;entation of burghs in the &s;tates general of all the great monarchies in Europe.</P>
<P>ORDER and good government, and along with them the liberty and &s;ecurity of individuals, were, in this manner, e&s;tabli&s;hed in cities at a time when the occupiers of land in the country were ex|po&s;ed to every &s;ort of violence. But men in this defencele&s;s &s;tate naturally content them&s;elves with their nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; be|cau&s;e to acquire more might only tempt the inju&s;tice of their op|pre&s;&s;ors. On the contrary, when they are &s;ecure of enjoying the fruits of their indu&s;try, they naturally exert it to better their con|dition, and to acquire not only the nece&s;&s;aries, but the conveniencies and elegancies of life. That indu&s;try, therefore, which aims at &s;omething more than nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, was e&s;tabli&s;hed in cities long before it was commonly practi&s;ed by the occupiers of land
<PB N="488" REF="499">
in the country. If in the hands of a poor cultivator, oppre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ervitude of villanage, &s;ome little &s;tock &s;hould accumulate; he would naturally conceal it with great care from his ma&s;ter, to whom it would otherwi&s;e have belonged, and take the fir&s;t op|portunity of running away to a town. The law was at that time &s;o indulgent to the inhabitants of towns, and &s;o de&s;irous of di|mini&s;hing the authority of the lords over tho&s;e of the country, that if he could conceal him&s;elf there from the pur&s;uit of his lord for a year, he was free for ever. Whatever &s;tock, therefore, accumulated in the hands of the indu&s;trious part of the inhabitants of the country, naturally took refuge in cities, as the only &s;anctuaries in which it could be &s;ecure to the per&s;on that ac|quired it.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of a city, it is true, mu&s;t always ultimately derive their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and the whole materials and means of their indu&s;try from the country. But tho&s;e of a city, &s;ituated near either the &s;ea-coa&s;t or the banks of a navigable river, are not nece&s;&s;arily confined to derive them from the country in their neighbourhood. They have a much wider range, and may draw them from the mo&s;t remote corners of the world, either in exchange for the ma|nufactured produce of their own indu&s;try, or by performing the office of carriers between di&s;tant countries, and exchanging the produce of one for that of another. A city might in this manner grow up to great wealth and &s;plendor, while not only the country in its neighbourhood, but all tho&s;e to which it traded, were in poverty and wretchedne&s;s. Each of tho&s;e countries, perhaps, taken &s;ingly, could afford it but a &s;mall part, either of its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or of its employment; but all of them taken together could afford it both a great &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and a great employment. There were, how|ever, within the narrow circle of the commerce of tho&s;e times, &s;ome countries that were opulent and indu&s;trious. Such was the
<PB N="489" REF="500">
Greek empire as long as it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and that of the Saracens during the reigns of the Aba&s;&s;ides. Such too was Egypt till it was con|quered by the Turks, &s;ome part of the coa&s;t of Barbary, and all tho&s;e provinces of Spain which were under the government of the Moors.</P>
<P>THE cities of Italy &s;eem to have been the fir&s;t in Europe which were rai&s;ed by commerce to any con&s;iderable degree of opulence. Italy lay in the center of what was at that time the improved and civilized part of the world. The Cruzades too, though by the great wa&s;te of &s;tock and de&s;truction of inhabitants which they occa&s;ioned, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have retarded the progre&s;s of the greater part of Europe, were extreamly favourable to that of &s;ome Italian cities. The great armies which marched from all parts to the conque&s;t of the holy land, gave extraordinary encouragement to the &s;hipping of Venice, Genoa, and Pi&s;a, &s;ometimes in tran&s;port|ing them thither, and always in &s;upplying them with provi&s;ions. They were the commi&s;&s;aries, if one may &s;ay &s;o, of tho&s;e armies; and the mo&s;t de&s;tructive frenzy that ever befel the European nations, was a &s;ource of opulence to tho&s;e republics.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of trading cities, by importing the improved manufactures and expen&s;ive luxuries of richer countries, afforded &s;ome food to the vanity of the great proprietors, who eagerly pur|cha&s;ed them with great quantities of the rude produce of their own lands. The commerce of a great part of Europe in tho&s;e times accordingly, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in the exchange of their own rude, for the manufactured produce of more civilized nations. Thus the wool of England u&s;ed to be exchanged for the wines of France, and the fine cloths of Flanders, in the &s;ame manner as the corn of Poland is at this day exchanged for the wines and brandies of France, and for the &s;ilks and velvets of France and Italy.</P>
<P><PB N="490" REF="501">
A TASTE for the finer and more improved manufactures, was in this manner introduced by foreign commerce into countries where no &s;uch works were carried on. But when this ta&s;te became &s;o general as to occa&s;ion a con&s;iderable demand, the merchants, in order to &s;ave the expence of carriage, naturally endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome manufactures of the &s;ame kind in their own country. Hence the origin of the fir&s;t manufactures for di&s;tant &s;ale that &s;eem to have been e&s;tabli&s;hed in the we&s;tern provinces of Europe, after the fall of the Roman empire.</P>
<P>No large country, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, ever did or could &s;ub&s;i&s;t without &s;ome &s;ort of manufactures being carried on in it; and when it is &s;aid of any &s;uch country that it has no manufactures, it mu&s;t always be under&s;tood of the finer and more improved, or of &s;uch as are fit for di&s;tant &s;ale. In every large country, both the cloath|ing and hou&s;hold furniture of the far greater part of the people, are the produce of their own indu&s;try. This is even more univer|&s;ally the ca&s;e in tho&s;e poor countries which are commonly &s;aid to have no manufactures, than in tho&s;e rich ones that are &s;aid to abound in them. In the latter, you will generally find, both in the cloaths and hou&s;hold furniture of the lowe&s;t rank of people, a much greater proportion of foreign productions than in the former.</P>
<P>THOSE manufactures which are fit for di&s;tant &s;ale, &s;eem to have been introduced into different countries in two different ways.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES they have been introduced, in the manner above mentioned, by the violent operation, if one may &s;ay &s;o, of the &s;tocks of particular merchants and undertakers, who e&s;tabli&s;hed them in imitation of &s;ome foreign manufactures of the &s;ame kind. Such manufactures, therefore, are the offspring of foreign
<PB N="491" REF="502">
commerce, and &s;uch &s;eem to have been the antient manufactures of &s;ilks, velvets, and brocades that were introduced into Venice in the beginning of the thirteenth century. Such too &s;eem to have been the manufactures of fine cloths that antiently flouri&s;hed in Flanders, and which were introduced into England in the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth; and &s;uch are the pre&s;ent &s;ilk manu|factures of Lyons and Spital-fields. Manufactures introduced in this manner are generally employed upon foreign materials; being in imitations of foreign manufactures. When the Venetian manufacture flouri&s;hed, there was not a mulberry tree, nor con&s;e|quently a &s;ilkworm in all Lombardy. They brought the materials from Sicily and from the Levant, the manufacture it&s;elf being in imitation of tho&s;e carried on in the Greek empire. Mulberry trees were fir&s;t planted in Lombardy in the beginning of the &s;ix|teenth century, by the encouragement of Ludovico Sforza duke of Milan. The manufactures of Flanders were carried on chiefly with Spani&s;h and Engli&s;h wool. Spani&s;h wool was the material, not of the fir&s;t woollen manufacture of England, but of the fir&s;t that was fit for di&s;tant &s;ale. More than one half the materials of the Lyons manufacture is at this day foreign &s;ilk; when it was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, the whole or very nearly the whole was &s;o. No part of the materials of the Spital-fields manufacture is ever likely to be the produce of England. The &s;eat of &s;uch manufactures, as they are generally introduced by the &s;cheme and project of a few individuals, is &s;ometimes e&s;tabli&s;hed in a maritime city, and &s;ome|times in an inland town, according as their intere&s;t, judgement or caprice happen to determine.</P>
<P>AT other times manufactures for di&s;tant &s;ale grow up naturally, and as it were of their own accord, by the gradual refinement of tho&s;e hou&s;hold and coar&s;er manufactures which mu&s;t at all times be carried on even in the poore&s;t and rude&s;t countries. Such
<PB N="492" REF="503">
manufactures are generally employed upon the materials which the country produces, and they &s;eem frequently to have been fir&s;t refined and improved in &s;uch inland countries as were, not indeed at a very great, but at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;ea coa&s;t, and &s;ometimes even from all water carriage. An inland country naturally fertile and ea&s;ily cultivated, produces a great &s;urplus of provi&s;ions beyond what is nece&s;&s;ary for maintaining the cultivators, and on account of the expence of land carriage, and inconveniency of river navigation, it may frequently be difficult to &s;end this &s;ur|plus abroad. Abundance, therefore, renders provi&s;ions cheap, and encourages a great number of workmen to &s;ettle in the neigh|bourhood, who find that their indu&s;try can there procure them more of the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life than in other places. They work up the materials of manufacture which the land produces, and exchange their fini&s;hed work, or what is the &s;ame thing the price of it, for more materials and provi&s;ions. They give a new value to the &s;urplus part of the rude produce by &s;aving the expence of carrying it to the water &s;ide or to &s;ome di&s;tant market; and they furni&s;h the cultivators with &s;omething in exchange for it that is either u&s;eful or agreeable to them, upon ea&s;ier terms than they could have obtained it before. The cultivators get a better price for their &s;urplus produce, and can purcha&s;e cheaper other conveniencies which they have occa&s;ion for. They are thus both encouraged and enabled to increa&s;e this &s;urplus produce by a further improvement and better cultivation of the land; and as the fer|tility of the land had given birth to the manufacture, &s;o the pro|gre&s;s of the manufacture re-acts upon the land, and increa&s;es &s;till further its fertility. The manufacturers fir&s;t &s;upply the neigh|bourhood, and afterwards, as their work improves and refines, more di&s;tant markets. For though neither the rude produce, nor even the coar&s;e manufacture could, without the greate&s;t difficulty, &s;up|port the expence of a con&s;iderable land carriage, the refined and
<PB N="493" REF="504">
improved manufacture ea&s;ily may. In a &s;mall bulk it frequently contains the price of a great quantity of rude produce. A piece of fine cloth, for example, which weighs only eighty pounds, con|tains in it, the price, not only of eighty pounds weight of wool, but &s;ometimes of &s;everal thou&s;and weight of corn, the maintenance of the different working people, and of their immediate employers. The corn which could with difficulty have been carried abroad in its own &s;hape, is in this manner virtually exported in that of the complete manufacture, and may ea&s;ily be &s;ent to the remote&s;t corners of the world. In this manner have grown up naturally, and as it were of their own accord, the manufactures of Leeds, Halifax, Sheffield, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton. Such manufactures are the offspring of agriculture. In the modern hi&s;tory of Europe, their exten&s;ion and improvement have generally been po&s;terior to tho&s;e which were the offspring of foreign com|merce. England was noted for the manufacture of fine cloths made of Spani&s;h wool, more than a century before any of tho&s;e which now flouri&s;h in the places above mentioned were fit for foreign &s;ale. The exten&s;ion and improvement of the&s;e la&s;t could not take place but in con&s;equence of the exten&s;ion and improvement of agriculture, the la&s;t and greate&s;t effect of foreign commerce, and of the manu|factures immediately introduced by it, and which I &s;hall now pro|ceed to explain.</P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="494" REF="505">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>How the Commerce of the Towns contributed to the Improvement of the Country.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE increa&s;e and riches of commercial and manufacturing towns, contributed to the improvement and cultivation of the countries to which they belonged, in three different ways.</P>
<P>FIRST, by affording a great and ready market for the rude produce of the country, they gave encouragement to its cultivation and further improvement. This benefit was not even confined to the countries in which they were &s;ituated, but extended more or le&s;s to all tho&s;e with which they had any dealings. To all of them they afforded a market for &s;ome part either of their rude or manu|factured produce, and con&s;equently gave &s;ome encouragement to the indu&s;try and improvement of all. Their own country, how|ever, on account of its neighbourhood, nece&s;&s;arily derived the greate&s;t benefit from this market. Its rude produce being charged with le&s;s carriage, the traders could pay the growers a better price for it, and yet afford it as cheap to the con&s;umers as that of more di&s;tant countries.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, the wealth acquired by the inhabitants of cities was frequently employed in purcha&s;ing &s;uch lands as were to be &s;old, of which a great part would frequently be uncultivated. Mer|chants are commonly ambitious of becoming country gentlemen, and when they do, they are generally the be&s;t of all improvers. A merchant is accu&s;tomed to employ his money chiefly in profitable projects; whereas a mere country gentleman is accu&s;tomed to
<PB N="495" REF="506">
employ it chiefly in expence. The one often &s;ees his money go from him and return to him again with a profit: The other when once he parts with it, very &s;eldom expects to &s;ee any more of it. Tho&s;e different habits naturally affect their temper and di&s;po&s;ition in every &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s. A merchant is commonly a bold; a country gentleman, a timid undertaker. The one is not afraid to lay out at once a large capital upon the improvement of his land, when he has a probable pro&s;pect of rai&s;ing the value of it in proportion to the expence. The other, if he has any capital, which is not always the ca&s;e, &s;eldom ventures to employ it in this manner. If he improves at all, it is commonly not with a capital, but with what he can &s;ave out of his annual revenue. Whoever has had the fortune to live in a mercantile town &s;ituated in an un|improved country, mu&s;t have frequently ob&s;erved how much more &s;pirited the operations of merchants were in this way, than tho&s;e of mere country gentlemen. The habits, be&s;ides, of order, oeconomy and attention, to which mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s naturally forms a merchant, render him much fitter to execute, with profit and &s;ucce&s;s, any project of improvement.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, and la&s;tly, commerce and manufactures gradually introduced order and good government, and with them, the liberty and &s;ecurity of individuals, among the inhabitants of the country, who had before lived almo&s;t in a continual &s;tate of war with their neighbours, and of &s;ervile dependency upon their &s;uperiors. This, though it has been the lea&s;t ob&s;erved, is by far the mo&s;t important of all their effects. Mr. Hume is the only writer who, &s;o far as I know, has hitherto taken notice of it.</P>
<P>IN a country which has neither foreign commerce, nor any of the finer manufactures, a great proprietor, having nothing for which he can exchange the greater part of the produce of his lands which is over and above the maintenance of the cultivators, con&s;umes the
<PB N="496" REF="507">
whole in ru&s;tick ho&s;pitality at home. If this &s;urplus produce is &s;uf|ficient to maintain a hundred or a thou&s;and men, he can make u&s;e of it in no other way than by maintaining a hundred or a thou&s;and men. He is at all times, therefore, &s;urrounded with a multitude of retainers and dependants, who having no equivalent to give in return for their maintenance, but being fed entirely by his bounty, mu&s;t obey him, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that &s;oldiers mu&s;t obey the prince who pays them. Before the exten&s;ion of commerce and manufactures in Europe, the ho&s;pitality of the rich and the great, from the &s;overeign down to the &s;malle&s;t baron, exceeded every thing which in the pre&s;ent times we can ea&s;ily form a notion of. We&s;t|min&s;ter hall was the dining room of William Rufus, and might frequently, perhaps, not be too large for his company. It was reckoned a piece of magnificence in Thomas Becket, that he &s;trowed the floor of his hall with clean hay or ru&s;hes in the &s;ea&s;on, in order that the knights and &s;quires, who could not get &s;eats, might not &s;poil their fine cloaths when they fat down on the floor to eat their dinner. The great earl of Warwick is &s;aid to have entertained every day at his different manors, thirty thou&s;and people; and though the number here may have been exaggerated, it mu&s;t, how|ever, have been very great to admit of &s;uch exaggeration. A ho&s;|pitality nearly of the &s;ame kind was exerci&s;ed not many years ago in many different parts of the highlands of Scotland. It &s;eems to be common in all nations to whom commerce and manufactures are little known. I have &s;een, &s;ays Doctor Pocock, an Arabian chief dine in the &s;treets of a town where he had come to &s;ell his cattle, and invite all pa&s;&s;engers, even common beggars, to &s;it down with him and partake of his banquet.</P>
<P>THE occupiers of land were in every re&s;pect as dependent upon the great proprietor as his retainers. Even &s;uch of them as were not in a &s;tate of villanage, were tenants at will, who paid a rent
<PB N="497" REF="508">
in no re&s;pect equivalent to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which the land afforded them. A crown, half a crown, a &s;heep, a lamb, was &s;ome years ago in the highlands of Scotland a common rent for lands which maintained a family. In &s;ome places it is &s;o at this day; nor will money at pre&s;ent purcha&s;e a greater quantity of commodities there than in other places. In a country where the &s;urplus produce of a large e&s;tate mu&s;t be con&s;umed upon the e&s;tate it&s;elf, it will fre|quently be more convenient for the proprietor, that part of it be con&s;umed at a di&s;tance from his own hou&s;e, provided they who con&s;ume it are as dependent upon him as either his retainers or his menial &s;ervants. He is thereby &s;aved from the embarra&s;&s;ment of either too large a company or too large a family. A tenant at will, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es land &s;ufficient to maintain his family for little more than a quit rent, is as dependant upon the proprietor as any &s;ervant or retainer whatever, and mu&s;t obey him with as little re&s;erve. Such a proprietor, as he feeds his &s;ervants and retainers at his own hou&s;e, &s;o he feeds his tenants at their hou&s;es. The &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of both is derived from his bounty, and its continuance depends upon his good plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>UPON the authority which the great proprietors nece&s;&s;arily had in &s;uch a &s;tate of things over their tenants and retainers, was founded the power of the antient barons. They nece&s;&s;arily became the judges in peace, and the leaders in war, of all who dwelt upon their e&s;tates. They could maintain order and execute the law within their re&s;pective deme&s;nes, becau&s;e each of them could there turn the whole force of all the inhabitants again&s;t the inju&s;tice of any one. No other per&s;on had &s;ufficient authority to do this. The king in particular had not. In tho&s;e antient times he was little more than the greate&s;t proprietor in his dominions, to whom for the &s;ake of common defence again&s;t their common ene|mies, the other great proprietors paid certain re&s;pects. To have enforced payment of a &s;mall debt within the lands of a great pro|prietor,
<PB N="498" REF="509">
where all the inhabitants were armed and accu&s;tomed to &s;tand by one another, would have co&s;t the king, had he attempted it by his own authority, almo&s;t the &s;ame effort as to extingui&s;h a civil war. He was, therefore, obliged to abandon the admini&s;|tration of ju&s;tice through the greater part of the country, to tho&s;e who were capable of admini&s;tering it; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on to leave the command of the country militia to tho&s;e whom that militia would obey.</P>
<P>IT is a mi&s;take to imagine that tho&s;e territorial juri&s;dictions took their origin from the feudal law. Not only the highe&s;t juri&s;dictions both civil and criminal, but the power of levying troops, of coin|ing money, and even that of making bye-laws for the government of their own people, were all rights po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed allodially by the great proprietors of land &s;everal centuries before even the name of the feudal law was known in Europe. The authority and juri&s;diction of the Saxon lords in England, appears to have been as great before the conque&s;t, as that of any of the Norman lords after it. But the feudal law is not &s;uppo&s;ed to have become the common law of England till after the conque&s;t. That the mo&s;t exten&s;ive au|thority and juri&s;dictions were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the great lords in France allodially long before the feudal law was introduced into that country, is a matter of fact that admits of no doubt. That au|thority and tho&s;e juri&s;dictions all nece&s;&s;arily flowed from the &s;tate of property and manners ju&s;t now de&s;cribed. Without remount|ing to the remote antiquities of either the French or Engli&s;h monarchies, we may find in much later times many proofs that &s;uch effects mu&s;t always flow from &s;uch cau&s;es. It is not thirty years ago &s;ince Mr. Cameron of Lochiel, a gentleman of Lochabar in Scot|land, without any legal warrant whatever, not being what was then called a lord of regality, nor even a tenant in chief, but a va&s;&s;al of the duke of Argylle, and without being &s;o much as a ju&s;tice of
<PB N="499" REF="510">
peace, u&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding, to exerci&s;e the highe&s;t criminal juri&s;|diction over his own people. He is &s;aid to have done &s;o with great equity, though without any of the formalities of ju&s;tice; and it is not improbable that the &s;tate of that part of the country at that time made it nece&s;&s;ary for him to a&s;&s;ume this authority in order to maintain the publick peace. That gentleman, who&s;e rent never exceeded five hundred pounds a year, carried, in 1745, eight hundred of his own people into the rebellion with him.</P>
<P>THE introduction of the feudal law, &s;o far from extending, may be regarded as an attempt to moderate the authority of the great allodial lords. It e&s;tabli&s;hed a regular &s;ubordination, accompanied with a long train of &s;ervices and duties, from the king down to the &s;malle&s;t proprietor. During the minority of the proprietor, the rent, together with the management of his lands, fell into the hands of his immediate &s;uperior, and, con&s;equently, tho&s;e of all great proprietors into the hands of the king, who was charged with the maintenance and education of the pupil, and who, from his authority as guardian, was &s;uppo&s;ed to have a right of di&s;|po&s;ing of him in marriage, provided it was in a manner not un|&s;uitable to his rank. But though this in&s;titution nece&s;&s;arily tended to &s;trengthen the authority of the king, and to weaken that of the great proprietors, it could not do either &s;ufficiently for e&s;tabli&s;h|ing order and good government among the inhabitants of the country; becau&s;e it could not alter &s;ufficiently that &s;tate of property and manners from which the di&s;orders aro&s;e. The authority of government &s;till continued to be, as before, too weak in the head and too &s;trong in the inferior members, and the exce&s;&s;ive &s;trength of the inferior members was the cau&s;e of the weakne&s;s of the head. After the in&s;titution of feudal &s;ubordi|nation, the king was as incapable of re&s;training the violence of the great lords as before. They &s;till continued to make war ac|cording
<PB N="500" REF="511">
to their own di&s;cretion, almo&s;t continually upon one another, and very frequently upon the king; and the open country &s;till continued to be a &s;cene of violence, rapine, and di&s;order.</P>
<P>BUT what all the violence of the feudal in&s;titutions could never have effected, the &s;ilent and in&s;en&s;ible operation of foreign commerce and manufactures gradually brought about. The&s;e gradually fur|ni&s;hed the great proprietors with &s;omething for which they could exchange the whole &s;urplus produce of their lands, and which they could con&s;ume them&s;elves without &s;haring it either with tenants or retainers. All for our&s;elves, and nothing for other people, &s;eems, in every age of the world, to have been the vile maxim of the ma&s;ters of mankind. As &s;oon, therefore, as they could find a method of con|&s;uming the whole value of their rents them&s;elves, they had no di&s;|po&s;ition to &s;hare them with any other per&s;ons. For a pair of diamond buckles perhaps, or for &s;omething as frivolous and u&s;ele&s;s, they exchanged the maintenance, or what is the &s;ame thing, the price of the maintenance of a thou&s;and men for a year, and with it the whole weight and authority which it could give them. The buckles, however, were to be all their own, and no other human creature was to have any &s;hare of them; whereas in the more antient method of expence they mu&s;t have &s;hared with at lea&s;t a thou&s;and people. With the judges that were to determine the preference, this difference was perfectly deci&s;ive; and thus, for the gratification of the mo&s;t childi&s;h, the meane&s;t and the mo&s;t &s;ordid of all vanities, they gradually bartered their whole power and authority.</P>
<P>IN a country where there is no foreign commerce, nor any of the &s;iner manufactures, a man of ten thou&s;and a year cannot well employ his revenue in any other way than in maintaining, perhaps, a thou&s;and families, who are all of them nece&s;&s;arily at his com|mand. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Europe, a man of ten thou&s;and a year can &s;pend his whole revenue, and he generally does &s;o, with|out
<PB N="501" REF="512">
directly maintaining twenty people, or being able to command more than ten footmen not worth the commanding. Indirectly, perhaps, he maintains as great or even a greater number of people than he could have done by the antient method of expence. For though the quantity of precious productions for which he ex|changes his whole revenue be very &s;mall, the number of workmen employed in collecting and preparing it, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been very great. Its great price generally ari&s;es from the wages of their labour, and the profits of all their immediate employers. By paying that price he indirectly pays all tho&s;e wages and profits, and thus indirectly contributes to the maintenance of all the work|men and their employers. He generally contributes, however, but a very &s;mall proportion to that of each, to very few perhaps a tenth, to many not a hundredth, and to &s;ome not a thou&s;andth nor even a ten thou&s;andth part of their whole annual maintenance. Though he contributes, therefore, to the maintenance of them all, they are all more or le&s;s independant of him, becau&s;e generally they can all be maintained without him.</P>
<P>WHEN the great proprietors of land &s;pend their rents in main|taining their tenants and retainers, each of them maintains entirely all his own tenants and all his own retainers. But when they &s;pend them in maintaining trade&s;men and artificers, they may, all of them taken together, perhaps, maintain as great, or, on account of the wa&s;te which attends ru&s;tick ho&s;pitality, a greater number of people than before. Each of them, however, taken &s;ingly, contributes often but a very &s;mall &s;hare to the maintenance of any individual of this greater number. Each trade&s;man or artificer derives his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the employment, not of one, but of a hundred or a thou&s;and different cu&s;tomers. Though in &s;ome mea&s;ure obliged to them all, therefore, he is not ab&s;olutely dependant upon any one of them.</P>
<P><PB N="502" REF="513">
THE per&s;onal expence of the great proprietors having in this manner gradually increa&s;ed, it was impo&s;&s;ible that the number of their retainers &s;hould not as gradually dimini&s;h, till they were at la&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ed altogether. The &s;ame cau&s;e gradually led them to di&s;mi&s;s the unnece&s;&s;ary part of their tenants. Farms were enlarged, and the occupiers of land, notwith&s;tanding the complaints of depopulation, reduced to the number nece&s;&s;ary for cultivating it according to the imperfect &s;tate of cultivation and improvement in tho&s;e times. By the removal of the unnece&s;&s;ary mouths, and by exacting from the farmer the full value of the farm, a greater &s;urplus, or what is the &s;ame thing, the price of a greater &s;urplus, was obtained for the proprietor, which the merchants and manufacturers &s;oon fur|ni&s;hed him with a method of &s;pending upon his own per&s;on in the &s;ame manner as he had done the re&s;t. The &s;ame cau&s;e continu|ing to operate, he was de&s;irous to rai&s;e his rents above what his lands, in the actual &s;tate of their improvement, could afford. His tenants could agree to this upon one condition only, that they &s;hould be &s;ecured in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, for &s;uch a term of years as might give them time to recover with profit whatever they &s;hould lay out in the further improvement of the land. The expen&s;ive vanity of the landlord made him willing to accept of this condition; and hence the origin of long lea&s;es.</P>
<P>EVEN a tenant at will, who pays the full value of the land, is not altogether dependent upon the landlord. The pecuniary ad|vantages which they receive from one another, are mutual and equal, and &s;uch a tenant will expo&s;e neither his life nor his fortune in the &s;ervice of the proprietor. But if he has a lea&s;e for a long term of years, he is altogether independent; and his landlord mu&s;t not expect from him even the mo&s;t trifling &s;ervice beyond what is either expre&s;&s;ly &s;tipulated in the lea&s;e, or impo&s;ed upon him by the common and known law of the country.</P>
<P><PB N="503" REF="514">
THE tenants having in this manner become independent, and the retainers being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, the great proprietors were no longer capable of interrupting the regular execution of ju&s;tice, or of di&s;|turbing the peace of the country. Having &s;old their birth-right, not like E&s;au for a me&s;s of pottage in time of hunger and nece&s;&s;ity, but in the wantonne&s;s of plenty, for trinkets and baubles fitter to be the play-things of children, than the &s;erious pur&s;uits of men, they became as in&s;ignificant as any &s;ub&s;tantial burgher or trade&s;man in a city. A regular government was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the country as well as in the city, nobody having &s;ufficient power to di&s;turb its operations in the one, any more than in the other.</P>
<P>IT does not, perhaps, relate to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, but I cannot help remarking it, that very old families, &s;uch as have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome con&s;iderable e&s;tate from father to &s;on for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations, are very rare in commercial countries. In countries which have little commerce, on the contrary, &s;uch as Wales or the highlands of Scotland, they are very common. The Arabian hi&s;tories &s;eem to be all full of genealogies, and there is a hi&s;tory written by a Tartar Khan which has been tran&s;lated into &s;everal European languages, and which contains &s;carce any thing el&s;e; a proof that antient families are very common among tho&s;e nations. In countries where a rich man can &s;pend his revenue in no other way than by maintaining as many people as it can main|tain, he is not apt to run out, and his benevolence it &s;eems is &s;eldom &s;o violent as to attempt to maintain more than he can afford. But where he can &s;pend the greate&s;t revenue upon his own per&s;on, he frequently has no bounds to his expence, becau&s;e he frequently has no bounds to his vanity, or to his affection for his own per&s;on. In commercial countries, therefore, riches, in &s;pite of the mo&s;t violent regulations of law to prevent their di&s;&s;i|pation, very &s;eldom remain long in the &s;ame family. Among
<PB N="504" REF="515">
&s;imple nations, on the contrary, they frequently do without any regulations of law; for among nations of &s;hepherds, &s;uch as the Tartars and Arabs, the con&s;umable nature of their property nece&s;|&s;arily renders all &s;uch regulations impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>A REVOLUTION of the greate&s;t importance to the publick hap|pine&s;s, was in this manner brought about by two different orders of people, who had not the lea&s;t intention to &s;erve the public. To gratify the mo&s;t childi&s;h vanity was the &s;ole motive of the great proprietors. The merchants and artificers, much le&s;s ridi|culous, acted merely from a view to their own intere&s;t, and in pur&s;uit of their own pedlar principle of turning a penny wherever a penny was to be got. Neither of them had either knowledge or forefight of that great revolution which the folly of the one, and the indu&s;try of the other was gradually bringing about.</P>
<P>IT is thus that through the greater part of Europe the commerce and manufactures of cities, in&s;tead of being the effect, have been the cau&s;e and occa&s;ion of the improvement and cultivation of the country.</P>
<P>THIS order, however, being contrary to the natural cour&s;e of things, is nece&s;&s;arily both &s;low and uncertain. Compare the &s;low progre&s;s of tho&s;e European countries of which the wealth depends very much upon their commerce and manufactures, with the rapid advances of our North American colonies, of which the wealth is founded altogether in agriculture. Through the greater part of Europe, the number of inhabitants is not &s;up|po&s;ed to double in le&s;s than five hundred years. In &s;everal of our North American colonies, it is found to double in twenty or five and twenty years. In Europe, the law of primogeniture, and per|petuities of different kinds, prevent the divi&s;ion of great e&s;tates,
<PB N="505" REF="516">
and thereby hinder the multiplication of &s;mall proprietors. A &s;mall proprietor, however, who knows every part of his little territory, who views it all with the affection which property, e&s;pecially &s;mall property, naturally in&s;pires, and who upon that account takes plea&s;ure not only in cultivating but in adorning it, is generally of all improvers the mo&s;t indu&s;trious, the mo&s;t intelli|gent, and the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful. The &s;ame regulations, be&s;ides, keep &s;o much land out of the market, that there are always more capitals to buy than there is land to &s;ell, &s;o that what is &s;old always &s;ells at a monopoly price. The rent never pays the intere&s;t of the purcha&s;e money, and is be&s;ides burdened with repairs and other occa&s;ional charges, to which the intere&s;t of money is not liable. To purcha&s;e land is every where in Europe a mo&s;t unprofitable employment of a &s;mall capital. For the &s;ake of the &s;uperior &s;ecu|rity, indeed, a man of moderate circum&s;tances, when he retires from bu&s;ine&s;s, will &s;ometimes chu&s;e to lay out his little capital in land. A man of profe&s;&s;ion too, who&s;e revenue is derived from another &s;ource, often loves to &s;ecure his &s;avings in the &s;ame way. But a young man, who, in&s;tead of applying to trade or to &s;ome profe&s;&s;ion, &s;hould employ a capital of two or three thou&s;and pounds in the purcha&s;e and cultivation of a &s;mall piece of land, might indeed expect to live very happily, and very independently, but mu&s;t bid adieu, forever, to all hope of either great fortune or great illu&s;tration, which by a different employment of his &s;tock he might have had the &s;ame chance of acquiring with other people. Such a per&s;on too, though he cannot a&s;pire at being a proprietor, will often di&s;dain to be a farmer. The &s;mall quantity of land, therefore, which is brought to market, and the high price of what is brought, prevents a great number of capitals from being employed in its cultivation and improvement which would otherwi&s;e have taken that direction. In North America, on the contrary, fifty or &s;ixty pounds is often found a &s;ufficient &s;tock
<PB N="506" REF="517">
to begin a plantation with. The purcha&s;e and improvement of uncultivated land, is there the mo&s;t profitable employment of the &s;malle&s;t as well as of the greate&s;t capitals, and the mo&s;t direct road to all the fortune and illu&s;tration which can be acquired in that country. Such land, indeed, is in North America to be had almo&s;t for nothing, or at a price much below the value of the natural produce; a thing impo&s;&s;ible in Europe, or, indeed, in any country where all lands have long been private property. If landed e&s;tates, however, were divided equally among all the children, upon the death of any proprietor who left a numerous family, the e&s;tate would generally be &s;old. So much land would come to market, that it could no longer &s;ell at a monopoly price. The free rent of the land would go nearer to pay the intere&s;t of the purcha&s;e money, and a &s;mall capital might be employed in pur|cha&s;ing land as profitably as in any other way.</P>
<P>ENGLAND, on account of the natural fertility of the &s;oil, of the great extent of &s;ea coa&s;t in proportion to that of the whole country, and of the many navigable rivers which run through it, and afford the conveniency of water carriage to &s;ome of the mo&s;t inland parts of it, is perhaps as well fitted by nature as any large country in Europe, to be the &s;eat of foreign commerce, of manufactures for di&s;tant &s;ale, and of all the improvements which the&s;e can occa&s;ion. From the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth too, the Engli&s;h legi&s;lature has been peculiarly attentive to the intere&s;ts of commerce and manufactures, and in reality there is no country in Europe, Holland it&s;elf not excepted, of which the law is upon the whole more favourable to this &s;ort of indu&s;try. Commerce and manu|factures have accordingly been continually advancing during all this period. The cultivation and improvement of the country has, no doubt, been gradually advancing too: But it &s;eems to have followed &s;lowly, and at a di&s;tance, the more rapid progre&s;s of
<PB N="507" REF="518">
commerce and manufactures. The greater part of the country mu&s;t probably have been cultivated before the reign of Elizabeth; and a very great part of it &s;till remains uncultivated, and the cultivation of the far greater part much inferior to what it might be. The law of England, however, favours agriculture not only indirectly by the protection of commerce, but by &s;everal direct encouragements. Except in times of &s;carcity, the exportation of corn is not only free, but encouraged by a bounty. In times of moderate plenty, the importation of foreign corn is loaded with duties that amount to a prohibition. The importation of live cattle, except from Ireland, is prohibited at all times, and it is but of late that it was permitted from thence. Tho&s;e who cultivate the land, therefore, have a monopoly again&s;t their countrymen for the two greate&s;t and mo&s;t important articles of land-produce, bread and butcher's meat. The&s;e encouragements, though at bottom, perhaps, as I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how hereafter, altogether illu&s;ory, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate at lea&s;t the good intention of the legi&s;lature to favour agriculture. But what is of much more importance than all of them, the yeomanry of England are rendered as &s;ecure, as independent, and as re&s;pectable as law can make them. No country, therefore, in which the right of primogeniture takes place, which pays tithes, and where perpetuities, though contrary to the &s;pirit of the law, are admitted in &s;ome ca&s;es, can give more encouragement to agriculture than England. Such, however, notwith&s;tanding, is the &s;tate of its cultivation. What would it have been, had the law given no direct encouragement to agriculture be&s;ides what ari&s;es indirectly from the progre&s;s of commerce, and had left the yeomanry in the &s;ame condition as in mo&s;t other countries of Europe? It is now more than two hundred years &s;ince the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth, a period as long as the cour&s;e of human pro&s;perity u&s;ually endures.</P>
<P><PB N="508" REF="519">
FRANCE &s;eems to have had a con&s;iderable &s;hare of foreign com|merce near a century before England was di&s;tingui&s;hed as a com|mercial country. The marine of France was con&s;iderable, according to the notions of the times, before the expedition of Charles the VIIIth to Naples. The cultivation and improvement of France, however, is, upon the whole, inferior to that of England. The law of the country has never given the &s;ame direct encouragement to agriculture.</P>
<P>THE foreign commerce of Spain and Portugal to the other parts of Europe, though chiefly carried on in foreign &s;hips, is very con&s;iderable. That to their colonies is carried on in their own, and is much greater, on account of the great riches and extent of tho&s;e colonies. But it has never introduced any con&s;iderable manufactures for di&s;tant &s;ale into either of tho&s;e countries, and the greater part of both &s;till remains uncultivated. The foreign commerce of Portugal is of older &s;tanding than that of any great country in Europe, except Italy.</P>
<P>ITALY is the only great country of Europe which &s;eems to have been cultivated and improved in every part, by means of foreign commerce and manufactures for di&s;tant &s;ale. Before the inva&s;ion of Charles the VIIIth, Italy, according to Guicciardin, was cultivated not le&s;s in the mo&s;t mountainous and barren parts of the country, than in the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t fertile. The ad|vantageous &s;ituation of the country, and the great number of independent &s;tates which at that time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in it, probably contributed not a little to this general cultivation. It is not impo&s;&s;ible too, notwith&s;tanding this general expre&s;&s;ion of one of the mo&s;t judicious and re&s;erved of modern hi&s;torians, that
<PB N="509" REF="520">
Italy was not at that time better cultivated than England is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE capital, however, that is acquired to any country by com|merce and manufacturers, is all a very precarious and uncertain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, till &s;ome part of it has been &s;ecured and realized in the cultivation and improvement of its lands. A merchant, it has been &s;aid very properly, is not nece&s;&s;arily the citizen of any par|ticular country. It is in a great mea&s;ure indifferent to him from what place he carries on his trade; and a very trifling di&s;gu&s;t will make him remove his capital, and together with it all the indu&s;try which it &s;upports, from one country to another. No part of it can be &s;aid to belong to any particular country, till it has been &s;pread as it were over the face of that country, either in buildings, or in the la&s;ting improvement of lands. No ve&s;tige now remains of the great wealth, &s;aid to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the greater part of the Hans towns, except in the ob&s;cure hi&s;tories of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. It is even uncertain where &s;ome of them were &s;ituated, or to what towns in Europe the Latin names given to &s;ome of them belong. But though the misfortunes of Italy in the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the &s;ixteenth cen|turies greatly dimini&s;hed the commerce and manufactures of the cities of Lombardy and Tu&s;cany, tho&s;e countries &s;till continue to be among the mo&s;t populous and be&s;t cultivated in Europe. The civil wars of Flanders, and the Spani&s;h government which &s;ucceeded them, cha&s;ed away the great commerce of Antwerp, Ghent, and Bruges. But Flanders &s;till continues to be one of the riche&s;t, be&s;t cultivated, and mo&s;t populous provinces of Europe. The ordinary revolutions of war and government ea&s;ily dry up the &s;ources of that wealth which ari&s;es from commerce only. That which ari&s;es from the more &s;olid improvements of
<PB N="510" REF="521">
agriculture, is much more durable, and cannot be de&s;troyed but by tho&s;e more violent convul&s;ions occa&s;ioned by the depredations of ho&s;tile and barbarous nations continued for a century or two together; &s;uch as tho&s;e that happened for &s;ome time before and after the fall of the Roman empire in the we&s;tern provinces of Europe.</P>
