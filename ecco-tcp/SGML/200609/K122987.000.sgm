<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT
From <HI>Daniel De Foe,</HI>
To <HI>Mr. Clark.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT was my fix't Re&s;olution never to foul any Paper, or
take up any Bodys time to Read, or my own, to Write
any thing about the quarrell Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> would fain make
with me; but I am oblidged to &s;peak to it, which &s;hall be
very &s;hort; Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> who denys a pa&s;&s;age Relating to him|&s;elf
in the Hi&s;tory of the Union, would fain Rail and hu&s;s me
into a Recantation of the pa&s;&s;age in publick, and &s;ince he de|&s;ires
it, he &s;hall have all I can po&s;&s;ibly make.</P>
<P>I had once the Honour to meet a Gentleman of Worth, and
a Friend of Mr. <HI>Clarks</HI> upon this affair to whom (Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>
pre&s;ent) I &s;aid, and to Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> I &s;aid at the &s;ame time, that
I would Write to my Friends at <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> from whom I had
my Information, and if they would not &s;tand to it, ju&s;tify,
own, and upon occa&s;ion prove what they had reported of
Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> I would give him any Rea&s;onable Satisfaction,
but if they would he could not expect, I would recant what I
had clear evidence of.</P>
<P>Now being very de&s;irous of giving all Men Satisfaction that
have any Objection to make again&s;t me, I accordingly have
Written to my Friends at <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and no doubt &s;hould
readily have complyed with Mr. <HI>Clark.</HI> But to my great
misfortune they Unamiou&s;ly Write me word, that what I
have Written in my Hi&s;tory is all true, and they are ready to
give ample Te&s;timony of it in my Vindication when ever I
plea&s;e, and have &s;ent me the Name of five Gentlemen of that
City, each of them of equall Reputation, Character and Cre|dite
as Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> him&s;elf (no Reflection I hope upon Mr.
<HI>Clark</HI>) who they &s;ay, particularly Remember the very words.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="2">
What to do in this ca&s;e I cannot tell, and would be glad
Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> would advi&s;e me, I have a very great Re&s;pect, nay
a Veneration and indeed the utmo&s;t regard to the office of a
Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, and I believe I have &s;hown it upon
&s;everal occa&s;ions; but I cannot per&s;wade my &s;elf to oppo&s;e Mr.
<HI>Clark's</HI> &s;ingle Negative, to five clear Affirmatives: Be&s;ides
what if one or more of the five &s;hould be Mini&s;ters too, will
Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> advi&s;e me to take his word and Condemn theirs?
When Truth is brought into &s;uch a &s;traight, I cannot but
think I am oblidged to go by the Number and Reputation of
the Witne&s;&s;es, and there I leave it. If Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> has a mind
to pu&s;h it any further, for he talked much of going to Law
with me, my An&s;wer is Brief, <HI>The Law is open;</HI> and tho' I
am a great way off, yet if he will inform me, what way he
would have me proceed I'll oblidge him as much as po&s;&s;ible in
An&s;wering (tho' at this di&s;tance) all the cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice de|mands,
being fully convinc't of the Truth and Impartiality
of my Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>I had la&s;t Po&s;t a Printed Paper &s;ent me which &s;ome Body (I
really know not who) has Write in my Vindication, I cannot
but thank the Author of that Paper for the good will he has
&s;hown to me, and for his concern for Truth which to me ar|gues
him an hone&s;t Man; And had he left out that needle&s;s
thing called Prai&s;e (which asking his Pardon) the World al|ways
calls Flattery, and I thank God I do not &s;eek, nor can
upon no Terms accept from any Body, had this been left out
I would have &s;et my hand to the Truth of every thing in that
Paper.</P>
<P>I &s;ee but one thing in it requires Explication, <HI>viz.</HI> where
he &s;peaks of my asking Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> pardon, and this I &s;ay needs
Explication; not that it is wrong related, but lea&s;t Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>
or any Body for him &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t that I had own'd, I had
Injur'd him in the Hi&s;tory, and had asked his Pardon&mdash;<HI>The
Ca&s;e is plain,</HI> I did at the Interce&s;&s;ion of two Hone&s;t Gentle|men,
and Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s Friends, they alledging it would be ve|ry
prejudicial to him, agree to alter the Sheet as it was fir&s;t
Printed to leave out his Name, and &s;ome Reflections I had
<PB N="3" REF="3">
made upon his Conduct (I appeal to tho&s;e Gentlemen, I told them
at fir&s;t I would not leave out the Matter of Fact) according to
my promi&s;e, I cau&s;ed the &s;heet to be altered and Re-printed
and gave &s;trict orders to the Printer, that none of the fir&s;t
&s;hould be publi&s;hed, as Mrs. <HI>Ander&s;on</HI> and her Servants, I
doubt not will do me the Ju&s;tice to own: But by the mi&s;take
of her Servants, and without my knowledge, many of the fir&s;t
&s;heets were delivered out, which I re&s;ented very much, and
cau&s;ed the leaf to be torn out of tho&s;e that came to my know|ledge,
<HI>even after the binding,</HI> and when I &s;aw Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> I told
him how it was, and tho' it was not my fault; yet I ask't his
Pardon, for it is a mi&s;take.</P>
<P>But the good Gentleman is plea&s;ed to forget this civility,
and Reproach me with it, after that acknowledgement as a
wilful Act of mine, which obliges me to tell him, I think my
&s;elf acquitted of my Capitulation, and &s;hall in any future Edi|tion
let Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> &s;ee it more plainly.</P>
<P>This I &s;ay by way of Explanation, of the Paper which is
publi&s;hed in my Vindication, I am told Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> is mighty
warm to find the Author of that Paper: Indeed were I the
Author, and had witten it in Vindication of another Per&s;on, I
would for a Muskin of Wine own it to him at the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> of
<HI>Edinburgh</HI>&mdash;The Articles of Per&s;onal Characters afore&s;aid on|ly
accepted, and I mu&s;t &s;ay in Ju&s;tice to the Author, and meer
Dictates of Con&s;cience, <HI>that abating,</HI> what I call Flattery (<HI>a
thing I abhor</HI> (and which I wi&s;h heartily that Gentleman had
left out&mdash;I &s;ee nothing in that Paper, but I believe to be very
true, all that is &s;ugge&s;ted &s;eems ju&s;t and fairly deduced, and
all that is affirm'd, I dare &s;ay can be proved, and Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s
Paper is &s;o well An&s;wered by that Gentleman, that I need
add nothing to it.</P>
<P>As for Scurrilous Treatment, and Abu&s;ive Language upon
me, in which Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> is plea&s;ed to abound, he that loves to
roll him&s;elf in his own Mire, let him do it, Railing never
mended an Argument, many a good one has it marr'd, many
a bad one made wor&s;e; I thank GOD, I have not been u&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="4">
to it, 'tis neither the Sin of my Education, or Inclination;
Le&s;s &s;till is it my Talent, and lea&s;t of all do I value it, when
it flys at me from another; If it moves any thing in me 'tis
my pity, for I take a Man when he is come to Railing to be
but a few &s;teps off, of di&s;traction&mdash;And all Men commi&s;erate
a Lunatick, in &s;hort <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion and ill Language</HI> is below a Gentle|man,
incon&s;i&s;tent with a Wi&s;e Man, remote from a good
Man, the di&s;ea&s;e of a Learned Man, and above all indecent
and unbecoming a Mini&s;ter&mdash;'Tis a breach of good Manners
a Reproach to Letters, a Scandal to Argument, and a Te&s;t of
Human Frailty; on the&s;e accounts, I take no notice of all
Mr. <HI>Clark'</HI>s Gall; 'tis throwing Du&s;t again&s;t the Wind, and it
all flys back in his own Eyes, let him Rail on.</P>
<P>I cannot think it needful to &s;ay any more, if Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> plea&s;es
to Writ Annually, or Monthly, or Daily, he is welcome, I
de&s;ire all my Friends, may let him alone, as I &s;hall; when he has
made an end, he will have done&mdash;and I am very well con|tent,
to let him have the la&s;t word of Flighting, as he had the
fir&s;t.</P>
<P>As to the History of the Union&mdash;what I have written, <HI>I
have written,</HI> there it &s;tands &s;upported by <HI>Truth,</HI> and &s;ufficient
evidence ready to be produced, when Ju&s;tice requires it, and
what can any Hi&s;torian de&s;ire more.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> thinks the World is to be amu&s;ed with his <HI>Ne|gative,</HI>
and with a bare denying the words upon his meer
Reputation, I tell him again, there are Men of equal Repu|tation
(and &s;ince he moves me to it, I do &s;ay) of Superiour
Reputation to him, that do affirm he &s;poke them, and if I
might advi&s;e him for his Reputation, it is my Opinion, he had
better let it alone, than &s;tir in this lay &s;till any further, lea&s;t the
&s;mell of it offend his Neighbours.</P>
