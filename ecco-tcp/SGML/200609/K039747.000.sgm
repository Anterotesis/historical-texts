<HEAD>Farther THOUGHTS
ON
TAR-WATER.</HEAD>
<P>AS the many Experiments that are daily made
of the Virtues of Tar-Water, furni&s;h new
Di&s;coveries and Reflexions, &s;ome of the&s;e I have
thrown together, and offer to the Public in hopes
they may prove u&s;eful.</P>
<P>It is a frequent Complaint, that Tar-Water is
made of bad Tar, being of a reddi&s;h Colour, &s;weeti&s;h
or di&s;agreeably in&s;ipid. But though the Dregs of
Tar are often foul, and make foul Tar-Water, and
though Tar already u&s;ed is often made u&s;e of by un|fair
Dealers a &s;econd, if not a third Time, which
produceth a vile Potion, void of the genuine Flavour
and Virtue of Tar-Water. Yet I apprehend the&s;e
Defects may &s;ometimes be a&s;cribed, rather to the
Ve&s;&s;el wherein the Tar-Water is made, than to the
Tar it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Tar-Water being made in an earthen Ve&s;&s;el un|glazed,
or that hath lo&s;t Part of its Glazing, may
extract (as it is a &s;trong Men&s;truum) from the Clay,
a fade Sweeti&s;hne&s;s, offen&s;ive to the Palate. It &s;hould
&s;eem therefore that the be&s;t Way of making Tar-Water
is in a Stone Jug, or earthen Ve&s;&s;el through|out
<PB N="10" REF="9">
well glazed, and, as it will not fail to extract a
Tincture from any metallic Ve&s;&s;el, it &s;hould be
warmed in a well glazed Pipkin, rather than a
Sauce-pan.</P>
<P>By increa&s;ing the Proportion of Tar to the Water,
and by &s;tirring it longer, Tar-Water may be made
&s;trong enough for a Spoonful to impregnate a large
Gla&s;s, a Thing very u&s;eful on a Road.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who in chronical Di&s;orders, or as a Pre|&s;ervative,
have for a long time drunk Tar-Water,
mu&s;t in acute Ca&s;es drink the more.</P>
<P>Tar-Water mu&s;t be drunk warm in Agues, Small-pox,
Mea&s;les and Fevers, in Colics and Di&s;orders
of the Bowels, in Gout al&s;o, and Rheumati&s;m, in
mo&s;t other Ailments cold or warm, at the Choice of
the Patient.</P>
<P>In Fevers the Patient cannot begin too &s;oon, or
drink too much. By undoubted Experience it is
found to cool the hot, and warm the cold, and to be
a mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful Medicine in Fevers, notwith&s;tand|ing
its great Virtue in Pal&s;ies and Drop&s;ies.</P>
<P>When not long &s;ince an Inflammation attacked
the Throat, Brea&s;t, and Lungs of Children, and
became general in my Neighbourhood, Numbers
were recovered by the U&s;e of Tar-Water, nor did
I hear that any mi&s;carried who u&s;ed it, though many
peri&s;hed who did not.</P>
<P>Nor is it a Medicine le&s;s proper and efficacious in
old Age. At the &s;ame time that this inflammatory
Di&s;temper raged among the Children, a Woman in
her &s;ixty-eighth Year, from violent Cold was &s;eized
at once with Ague, Colic, and Jaundice, of all
which Maladies &s;he was cured in a Fortnight, by
drinking three Pints of warm Tar-water every Day.
Numberle&s;s &s;uch In&s;tances daily occur, which &s;hew
it to be a &s;afe and efficacious Medicine both for old
and young.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
Evacuations by Sweat, which u&s;ually render Pa|tients
very weak and di&s;pirited, have not the &s;ame
bad Effects when produced by Tar-Water, which
I have frequently known to give high Spirits in all
the Stages of a Fever, and under the lowe&s;t Regi|men,
therefore old People and weak Per&s;ons, who
cannot well bear common Evacuations, are be&s;t
cured by Tar-Water, which in &s;ome Sort &s;eemeth
to renew tho&s;e who are worn out with Age and
Infirmities.</P>
<P>Tar-Water is of &s;ingular U&s;e in &s;trengthening the
Stomach and Bowels, and agrees particularly well
with Infants, taken either by them&s;elves or by the
Nur&s;e, and be&s;t by both. Though as it throws the
ill Humours out into the Surface of the Skin, it
may render them for a Time, perhaps, un&s;eemly
with Eruptions, but withal healthy and lively. And
I will venture to &s;ay, that it lays in them the Prin|ciples
of a good Con&s;titution for the re&s;t of their
Lives.</P>
<P>Nor is it only u&s;eful to the Bodies of Infants, it
hath al&s;o a good Effect on their Minds, as tho&s;e who
drink it are ob&s;erved to be remarkably forward and
&s;prightly. Even the mo&s;t heavy, lumpi&s;h, and un|promi&s;ing
Infants, appear to be much improved
by it. A Child there is in my Neighbourhood, of
fine Parts, who at fir&s;t &s;eemed &s;tupid and an Idiot,
but, by con&s;tant U&s;e of Tar-Water, grew lively
and ob&s;erving, and is now noted for Under&s;tand|ing
beyond others of the &s;ame Age.</P>
<P>Infants are ea&s;ily brought to take it by Spoon, and
even grow to a Liking of it, and as their Di&s;orders
ari&s;e chiefly from Indige&s;tion, they receive the great|e&s;t
Benefit from a Medicine &s;o well calculated to
&s;trengthen the Inte&s;tines, and pre&s;erve them from
Fits. In a word, if it were the common Practice
to accu&s;tom Infants from the Beginning to take Tar-Water,
<PB N="12" REF="11">
this would greatly conduce to the Health
both of their Minds and Bodies. There is, I am
verily per&s;uaded, no one Thing in the power of
Art or Nature, that would &s;o generally and effectually
contribute to repair the Con&s;titutions of our Gentry
and Nobility, by &s;trengthning the Children, and
ca&s;ting off in their Infancy tho&s;e Impurities and
Taints, which they often bring into the World.</P>
<P>An Infant may take one Quarter of a Pint in the
Day, warm, by Spoonfuls; le&s;s may do good, and
there is no fear of Exce&s;s. When I con&s;ider the
private Woe of Families, as well as the public
Lo&s;s occa&s;ioned by the Death of &s;uch an incredible
Number of Infants, under two Years of Age, I
cannot but in&s;i&s;t on recommending Tar-Water, both
as a Remedy and Pre&s;ervative in that tender Age,
which cannot bear the common Treatment and
Methods of Phy&s;ic, or with &s;afety take tho&s;e Drugs
which are fitter for grown Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Another Rea&s;on which recommends Tar-Water,
particularly to Infants and Children, is the great
Security it brings again&s;t the Small-pox, to tho&s;e
that drink it, who are ob&s;erved, either never to
take that Di&s;temper, or to have it in the gentle&s;t
Manner.</P>
<P>There is no Di&s;temper more contagious and de|&s;tructive
than the Small-pox, or more generally
dreaded, attended with wor&s;e Symptoms, or that
leaves behind it wor&s;e Effects; I ob&s;erve at the
&s;ame time, that Tar-Water is in no other Ca&s;e a
more &s;afe and &s;ure Remedy than in this; of which
Captain <HI>Drape</HI>'s Certificate, &s;worn to before the
Mayor of <HI>Liverpool,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of &s;everal
principal Per&s;ons of that Town, is a mo&s;t evident
Proof.</P>
<P>That one hundred and &s;eventy Per&s;ons, &s;eized at
once with the Small-pox, deprived of all Conve|niencies,
<PB N="13" REF="12">
and in the wor&s;t Circum&s;tances of a nar|row
Ship and hot Climate, &s;hould all recover by
the &s;ingle Medicine of Tar-Water, except one who
would not drink it, is a matter of Fact, &s;o plain
and convincing, and &s;o well atte&s;ted, as to leave no
Doubt in Minds free from Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, about the
U&s;efulne&s;s and Efficacy of Tar-Water in the Small-pox;
a Point I had been before &s;ufficiently convinced
of, by many In&s;tances in my own Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>It hath been &s;urmi&s;ed by &s;ome celebrated Phy|&s;icians,
that one Day a Specific may be di&s;covered
for the peculiar Venom of the Small-pox. There
&s;eems to be &s;ome Rea&s;on for thinking that Tar-Water
is &s;uch a Specific. I &s;ay this on good Grounds,
having by many Experiments ob&s;erved its Virtue
in curing, as well as in preventing, that cruel Di&s;|temper;
during the whole Cour&s;e of which, it is to
be drank warm; a moderate Gla&s;s (about Half a
Pint) every Hour, in common Ca&s;es, may &s;uffice,
in bad Ca&s;es more may be given; there is no Fear
of Exce&s;s.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who endeavour to di&s;credit this cooling
Cordial, and &s;alutary Medicine, as an Inflamer of
the Blood, do very con&s;i&s;tently decry its U&s;e in the
Small-pox; but there can be nothing more clear,
full, and &s;atisfactory than Captain <HI>Drape</HI>'s Affida|vit,
to convince rea&s;onable People of the great and
&s;urpri&s;ing Efficacy of Tar-Water, in the Cure of
the Small-pox; and con&s;equently of the ground|le&s;ne&s;s
of that Report, which a&s;cribes a heating or
inflaming Quality to it. And yet that groundle&s;s
Report hath hindred many from reaping the Benefit
they might otherwi&s;e have done, from the U&s;e of
this Water, which is of excellent Virtue in all kinds
of inflammatory Di&s;orders, Fevers, Quin&s;ies, Pleu|ri&s;ies,
and &s;uch like of the hot and inflamed Kind,
<PB N="14" REF="13">
whereof the Public as well as my&s;elf have known a
Multitude of Examples.</P>
<P>I ask whether the Fact &s;worn before the Magi|&s;trates
of <HI>Liverpool,</HI> be not a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to
all that is objected, from an inflaming Quality, to
Tar-Water. Can any In&s;tance be produced in the
whole <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> or Hi&s;tory of Phy&s;ic, of
the Virtue of a Medicine tried on greater Numbers,
or under greater Di&s;advantages, or with greater
Succe&s;s, or more credibly atte&s;ted. I wi&s;h for
the common Good of Mankind, that the &s;ame Ex|periment
was tried in our Ho&s;pitals. Probably
the World would &s;oon be relieved from that great
and general Terror of the Small-pox.</P>
<P>When I hear of the Deva&s;tations made by this
Di&s;temper, in great Cities and populous Towns,
how many Lives are lo&s;t, or (as may be &s;aid) thrown
away, which might have been in all likelihood ea&s;ily
pre&s;erved, by the U&s;e of a Medicine, &s;o cheap and
obvious, and in eyery one's power, it &s;eems Matter
of great Concern and A&s;toni&s;hment, and leaves one
at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s at the Motives, that govern hu|man
Actions in Affairs of the greate&s;t moment.
The Experiment may be ea&s;ily made, if an equal
Number of poor Patients in the Small-pox, were put
into two Ho&s;pitals at the &s;ame Time of the Year,
and provided with the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;aries of Diet and
Lodging, and, for further Care, let the one have a
Tub of Tar-Water and an old Woman; the other
Ho&s;pital, what Attendance and Drugs you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>In all ob&s;tinate Sores and Ulcers, I very much re|commend
the drinking of Tar-Water, and wa&s;hing
them with a &s;trong Lotion of it, will ha&s;ten the
Cure.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t painful and dangerous Ca&s;es is
that of a Woman's fore Brea&s;t. How many poor
<PB N="15" REF="14">
Creatures after long langui&s;hing in Mi&s;ery, are
obliged to &s;uffer the mo&s;t &s;evere chirurgical Opera|tions,
often the cutting off the entire Brea&s;t? The
U&s;e of Tar-Water in tho&s;e Ca&s;es hath been attended
with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that I do earne&s;tly recommend
the drinking thereof, both as a Cure and Pre&s;erva|tive,
as a mo&s;t effectual Medicine to remove the
&s;hooting Pains that precede a Cancer, and al&s;o to
cure the Cancer it&s;elf, without Amputation. Can|cerous
and &s;ore Brea&s;ts are &s;uch cruel Ca&s;es, occa|&s;ioned
by &s;o many internal Cau&s;es, as well as out|ward
Accidents, that it is a nece&s;&s;ary Piece of Hu|manity,
to contribute all we can to the Prevention
and Cure thereof.</P>
<P>In the King's Evil, Lepro&s;y, and foule&s;t Ca&s;es,
Tar-Water cannot be too much recommended. The
poor Vagabonds of <HI>Ireland,</HI> are many of them in|fected
and eaten up with the foul Di&s;ea&s;e, which
with them pa&s;&s;eth for a Canker, as they call it.
Several In&s;tances of extraordinary Cures have been
performed on &s;uch Per&s;ons, by drinking Tar-Water
copiou&s;ly, for &s;ome Weeks or Months together,
without Confinement or other Re&s;traint, than that
of a regular cool Diet. It is indeed a Specific, both
for this and all other Taints and Impurities of the
Blood.</P>
<P>An Extract of <HI>Siris</HI> was made, and Accounts of
the Effects of Tar-Water were reprinted in <HI>America,</HI>
in which Continent, as well as in the I&s;lands, much
U&s;e hath been made thereof, particularly by tho&s;e
who po&s;&s;e&s;s great Numbers of Slaves: Of this I have
been informed by Letters, and by Word of Mouth,
from Per&s;ons belonging to tho&s;e Parts, who have
a&s;&s;ured me of the exten&s;ive and &s;ucce&s;sful U&s;e of
this Medicine in many Ca&s;es, and more e&s;pecially
in the mo&s;t inveterate Kinds of the &s;oul Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
I need not &s;ay how dearly they purcha&s;e Health
who obtain it by Salivation, and yet long and &s;e|vere
as that Cour&s;e is, it is often un&s;ucce&s;sful. There
are In&s;tances of &s;uch as having pa&s;&s;ed through it
with much Mi&s;ery and Patience, have been after|wards
cured by the &s;imple U&s;e of Tar-Water.</P>
<P>The King's Evil, &s;o loth&s;om in its Symptoms
and Effects, and withal &s;o difficult, if at all po&s;&s;ible,
to cure by any other Method, is mo&s;t &s;urely and
ea&s;ily cured by the Tar-Water, even when the Pa|tient
is far gone, even when he derives it from his
Ance&s;tors. A Quart <HI>per diem</HI> for a few Months,
I have known to cure the mo&s;t deplorable and
abandoned Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>How many wealthy Families, otherwi&s;e at their
Ea&s;e, are corrupted with this Taint in their Blood?
How many want Heirs and Husbands, through this
odious Malady? A Specific for this Di&s;ea&s;e alone,
would be ju&s;tly e&s;teemed a mo&s;t valuable Secret, and
the plenty and cheapne&s;s of the Medicine ought not
in Rea&s;on to make it le&s;s e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>Salivating, Bleeding, and Purging, are attended
with great Hard&s;hips and Inconveniencies (even
where the Patient recovers) reducing the Strength
and Spirits of tho&s;e who u&s;e them, whereas Tar-Water
greatly adds to both.</P>
<P>In Fractures and Wounds, a Quart or two drank
daily, while the Patient is under Cure, doth very
much a&s;&s;uage the Pain and promote his Recovery,
both as by its bal&s;amic Nature it di&s;po&s;eth the Parts
to heal, and al&s;o as it le&s;&s;ens if not totally prevents
the Fever.</P>
<P>A poor Boy in <HI>Cloyne,</HI> having fallen from a
Tree, broke both Arm and Wri&s;t. This Accident
was concealed or neglected for two or three Weeks;
he was then put under the Care of a skilful Bone|&s;etter,
<PB N="17" REF="16">
who finding the Bones knit and grown
crooked, and that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to break
them again, in order to &s;et them right, and withal
con&s;idering the hot Sea&s;on of the Year (in <HI>July</HI>) he
apprehended his Patient's being thrown into a Fe|ver
that might prove fatal. But the Boy being
made to drink copiou&s;ly of Tar-Water, this pre|vented
or le&s;&s;ened the Fever in &s;uch &s;ort, that the
Bones were broke and &s;et again, and the Cure pro|ceded
as ea&s;ily and &s;peedily as Could be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>I have known &s;everal In&s;tances of Brui&s;es and
Wounds cured by Tar-Water. A Per&s;on in my
Neighbourhood ran over by a Hor&s;e was much
brui&s;ed, and cured only by drinking Tar-Water.
Another knocked down with a Mallet, thereupon
thrown into a violent Fever, and given for dead;
another wounded with an Axe, &s;o that his Life was
thought in danger, were both recovered by the U&s;e
of Tar-Water; which, as it is &s;overeign again&s;t
Gangrenes and Fevers, hath great Succe&s;s in all
Sorts of Wounds, Contu&s;ions, and Fractures, being
taken throughout the whole chirurgical Proce&s;s,
along with what&s;oever other Methods or Remedies
are applied.</P>
<P>Tar-Water operates variou&s;ly. In Drop&s;ies and
Brui&s;es it hath been known to work by purging.
The &s;tronger Kind being u&s;ed as a Wa&s;h, is good
again&s;t ulcerous Eruptions. But in all Ca&s;es where
the Lotion is u&s;ed, I believe the drinking of Tar-Water
might alone &s;uffice, albeit the Sores may be
longer withering and drying away.</P>
<P>There is a certain Age or Time of Life, when the
female Sex runs no &s;mall Risk from the cea&s;ing of
their natural Evacuations. In this Ca&s;e Tar-Water
is a good Pre&s;ervative, purifying the Blood, and
clearing it from that cancerous Tendency, which it
is &s;ometimes &s;ubject to, about that time. I take it
<PB N="18" REF="17">
to be a Specific in all cancerous Ca&s;es, even the
bleeding Cancer, e&s;teemed incurable by Phy&s;icians,
hath been cured by Tar-Water.</P>
<P>In Di&s;ea&s;es peculiar to Women it is of no &s;mall
U&s;e. Several who had &s;uffered much by Accidents
in Child-bearing, have found them&s;elves relieved by
Tar-Water. In all Sorts of Tumours, Wens, and
praeternatural Excre&s;cences, it hath been found an
excellent Remedy.</P>
<P>Many dangerous Symptoms, and even &s;udden
Death are often owing to a Polypus, in &s;ome or
other of the Ve&s;&s;els, through which the Blood cir|culates,
than which it &s;eems there is no inward Cau&s;e
of Death or Di&s;ea&s;e more to be dreaded and guard|ed
again&s;t; how many drop down dead in our
Streets, or at Table, or in the mid&s;t of Bu&s;ine&s;s or
Diver&s;ions? how many are found dead in their Beds?</P>
<P>Tremors, Palpitations of the Heart, irregular
Pul&s;es, Apoplexies, &s;udden Deaths, often proceed
from a &s;low, &s;tagnating, interrupted Motion, or
&s;toppage of the Blood, in its Circulation through
the Body; and there &s;eemeth to be no Cau&s;e &s;o cer|tainly
productive of ob&s;tructed Circulation, as the
Polypus, a Ca&s;e, perhaps, much more frequent
than is commonly imagined. <HI>Morgagni,</HI> the cele|brated
Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Padua,</HI> and mo&s;t eminent Ana|tomi&s;t,
who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have di&s;&s;ected more
human Bodies than any Man living, a&s;&s;ured me,
above thirty Years ago, that in the far greater Part
of &s;uch Bodies, he found Polypu&s;es, if not in the
Ventricles of the Heart or larger Ve&s;&s;els, yet in
&s;ome other Ve&s;&s;el or Cavity; to which he attributes
many Di&s;orders, and which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be form|ed
by the ob&s;tructed Motion of the Blood. To
prevent this, he di&s;&s;uaded from all tight Ligatures,
e&s;pecially in Sleep, unbuttoning the Neck and
Wri&s;t-bands of his Shirt every Night, a Practice he
<PB N="19" REF="18">
had learned (as he &s;aid) from his Ma&s;ter, the famous
<HI>Malpighi.</HI></P>
<P>When the Circulation is once quite &s;topped, no|thing
can re&s;tore it, which would be the &s;ame thing
as re&s;toring a dead Man to Life, and in Proportion,
as the Circulation of the Blood is ob&s;tructed, the
Body is di&s;ordered. Total Ob&s;truction is Death;
partial Ob&s;truction is Di&s;ea&s;e. The Polypus there|fore
is always hurtful, if not mortal. It is, indeed,
matter of &s;erious Reflexion, that we may probably
carry about with us a Principle of Death, always
at work within, and of a Nature &s;o violent and
&s;udden in its Effects, &s;o hard to come at, and &s;o
difficult to &s;ubdue.</P>
<P>It may well be thought at fir&s;t View, a vain Un|dertaking,
to attempt to di&s;&s;olve a fle&s;hy or mem|branous
Sub&s;tance, &s;o latent and inacce&s;&s;ible, by
common Means or Medicines. But, as Tar-Water
hath been undoubtedly known to di&s;&s;olve and di&s;|per&s;e
Wens, and other fle&s;hy or membranous Tu|mours,
in the outward Parts of the Body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Effects of Tar Water, Sect 228, and 229.</NOTE>, having
been drank and circulated with the Blood, it &s;hould
&s;eem by a Parity of Rea&s;on, that it may al&s;o di&s;|&s;olve
and put an End to tho&s;e Concretions that
are formed in the Ventricles of the Heart or Blood
Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;o remove one great Cau&s;e of Apo|plexies
and &s;udden Death; and what cures may
prevent. I have been the longer on this Subject,
for the &s;ake of many who lead &s;ickly Lives, as
well as &s;everal who are &s;natched away by untimely
Death.</P>
<P>Univer&s;ally, in all Ca&s;es where other Methods
fail, I could wi&s;h this of Tar-Water was tried. It
hath been &s;ometimes known, that the mo&s;t inve|terate
Head-aches, and other nervous Di&s;orders,
<PB N="20" REF="19">
that would yield to no other Medicine, have been
cured by a Cour&s;e of Tar-Water, regularly and con|&s;tantly
pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>Where&s;oever pure Blood or Plenty of Spirits are
wanting, it may be concluded from manifold Ex|perience,
that Tar-Water is of &s;ingular Benefit.
Several Per&s;ons have acknowledged them&s;elves to be
much fitter to go through Bu&s;ine&s;s or Study from
the U&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Nor is it only medicinal to human Kind: it is
al&s;o of no &s;mall u&s;e in the Curing of brute Ani|mals.
It hath been tried on &s;everal Kinds, particu|larly
with great Succe&s;s in the late epidemical Di&s;|temper
of our Hor&s;es. And I have been credibly
informed, that being drank in plenty, it hath re|covered
even a glandered Hor&s;e, that was thought
incurable.</P>
<P>And as it is of &s;uch exten&s;ive u&s;e, both to Man
and Bea&s;t, it &s;hould &s;eem, that a Tub of Tar-Wa|ter
con&s;tantly &s;upplied in a Market-Town, would
&s;erve, in &s;ome &s;ort, for an Ho&s;pital. Many other
Drugs are not ea&s;ily got, this is every where plenty
and cheap; many are of a doubtful Nature, this of
known Innocence; others &s;oon peri&s;h, this la&s;ts
for Years, and is not the wor&s;e for keeping. This,
in &s;hort, is a Medicine for the common People,
being a &s;afe and cheap Remedy; for &s;uch as cannot
afford to be long &s;ick, or to make u&s;e of co&s;tly
Medicines.</P>
<P>A Patient who drinks Tar-Water, mu&s;t not be
alarmed at Pu&s;tules or Eruptions in the Skin; the&s;e
are good Symptoms, and &s;hew the Impurities of the
Blood to be ca&s;t out. It is al&s;o not ami&s;s to ob&s;erve,
that, as Tar-Water by its active Qualities, doth
&s;tir the Humours, entering the minute&s;t Capillaries,
and di&s;lodging Ob&s;tructions, it may happen that
this working &s;hall &s;ometimes be felt in the Limbs,
<PB N="21" REF="20">
or di&s;charge it&s;elf in a Fit of the Gout, which, how|ever
di&s;agreeable, proves &s;alutary.</P>
<P>I am credibly informed of &s;everal &s;trange Con|veyances,
which Tar-Water hath found out, where|by
to di&s;charge Impurities from the human Con|&s;titution.
A Per&s;on who had been in a bad &s;tate
of Health above twenty Years, upon a Cour&s;e of
Tar-Water was thrown into a mo&s;t extraordinary
Fit of an Ague, and from that time recovered a
good State of Health. An old Gentleman in the
County of <HI>Cork,</HI> who for a long time had been a
Valetudinarian, afflicted with many Infirmities, be|ing
advi&s;ed to drink Tar-Water, found him&s;elf re|lieved,
but it produced and &s;oon cured a Pthiria&s;is
or lou&s;y Di&s;temper, in which the putrid Humours
having di&s;charged them&s;elves, left him quite &s;ound
and healthy.</P>
<P>In a Cour&s;e of Tar-Water, if any Di&s;order hap|pens
from &s;ome other Cau&s;e, as from Cold, from
the u&s;e of &s;trong Liquors, from a Surfeit, or &s;uch
like Accident, it would not be fair to impute it
to Tar-Water; and yet this hath been &s;ometimes
done.</P>
<P>The Effects of Vomiting occa&s;ioned by Tar-Water
are not to be apprehended. Some are di&s;|couraged
from drinking becau&s;e their Stomachs
cannot bear it. But when it takes a turn towards
working upwards, Nature, by that very way, hath
been often known to carry on the Cure. A worthy
Gentleman, Member of Parliament, came into my
Neighbourhood, in the Autumn of the Year 1750;
he was cachectic and extremely reduced, &s;o that his
Friends thought him near his End. Upon his en|tering
into a Cour&s;e of Tar-Water, it produced a
prodigious Vomiting, which weakened him much
for the pre&s;ent; but per&s;i&s;ting to continue the U&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="21">
thereof for about two Months, he was re&s;tored to
his Health, Strength and Spirits.</P>
<P>Tar-Water is very diuretic, thereby preventing
Stone and Gravel, and carrying off by Urine, tho&s;e
Salts that might otherwi&s;e occa&s;ion Fevers, Rheu|mati&s;ms,
Drop&s;ies, Head-aches, and many other
Di&s;orders, if retained in the Blood. Hence, &s;ome
have apprehended a Diabetes, from the continued
U&s;e thereof, but it is &s;o far from cau&s;ing a Diabetes,
that it hath been known to cure that Di&s;order.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titution of a Patient &s;ometimes requireth
during a Cour&s;e of Tar-Water, that he take Water
and Honey, al&s;o ro&s;ted Apples, &s;tewed Prunes and
other Diet of an opening Kind. A Hint of this is
&s;ufficient. If the Reader now and then meets with
&s;ome Remarks, contained in my former Writings
on this Subject, he may be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider, I
had rather repeat than forget what I think u&s;eful to
be known.</P>
<P>Some, endeavouring to di&s;courage the U&s;e of
Tar-Water in <HI>England,</HI> have given out that it may
indeed be &s;erviceable in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where People live
on &s;uch low Diet as &s;our Milk and Potatoes, but it
cannot be of the &s;ame Service in <HI>England,</HI> where
Men are accu&s;tomed to a more liberal and hearty
Food; and indeed it mu&s;t be owned, that the
Pea&s;ants in this I&s;land, live but poorly, but no
People in <HI>Europe</HI> live better (in the Sen&s;e of Ea|ting
and Drinking) than our Gentry and Citizens;
and from the&s;e the In&s;tances of Cures by Tar-Water
have been chiefly taken. Tho&s;e who would con|fine
its U&s;e to the moi&s;t Air and poor Diet of
<HI>Ireland,</HI> may be a&s;&s;ured that all over <HI>Europe,</HI> in
<HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Germany, Italy, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI>
Tar-Water works the &s;ame Effect. In both <HI>North</HI>
and <HI>South,</HI> in <HI>We&s;t</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> it hath been
<PB N="23" REF="22">
u&s;ed and continues to be u&s;ed with great Succe&s;s.
It hath reached all our Colonies both on the Con|tinent
and the I&s;lands, and many Barrels of Tar-Water
have been &s;ent from <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> to <HI>Batavia;</HI>
of all which I have had authentic Accounts. But
its U&s;e is no where more con&s;picuous than at Sea,
in curing that Plague of &s;ea-faring Per&s;ons, the
Scurvy, as was found in the late Attempt to di&s;cover
a north-we&s;t Pa&s;&s;age; and (as I doubt not) will be
found as oft as it is tried. Every Ship in his Ma|je&s;ty's
Navy &s;hould always have a Ve&s;&s;el of Tar-Water
upon Deck, for the U&s;e of the Sailors, both
in the Scurvy and other Maladies.</P>
<P>It is indeed a Medicine equally calculated for all
Climates, for Sea and Land, for rich and poor,
high and low Livers; being, as hath been el&s;e|where
mentioned, a Cordial which doth not heat;
a peculiar Privilege this, and of excellent U&s;e.
That it is a Cordial, is manife&s;t from its cheering
and enlivening Quality, and that it is not heating,
is as manife&s;t, from its &s;ingular U&s;e in all Ca&s;es
where the Blood is inflamed. As this Medicine
imparts a genial friendly Warmth, &s;uited to the
human Con&s;titution, tho&s;e who pa&s;s through a
Cour&s;e of Tar-Water, would do well not to in|crea&s;e
&s;uch friendly Warmth to an inflaming Heat,
by a wrong Regimen of high-&s;ea&s;oned Food and
&s;trong Liquors, which are not wanted by the Drink|ers
of Tar-Water. There is a certain Degree of
Heat nece&s;&s;ary to the Well-being and Life of Man.
More than this will be unea&s;y, and this Unea&s;ine&s;s
indicates a proper Choice of Diet.</P>
<P>I have my&s;elf drank above a Gallon of Tar-Water
in a few Hours, and been cooled and re|covered
from a Fever by it. So many In&s;tances of
the &s;ame Nature I have known, as would make it
evident to any unprejudiced Per&s;on, that Tar-Water
<PB N="24" REF="23">
is a cooling Medicine; of which Truth I
am as thoroughly convinced, as it is po&s;&s;ible to be
of any Theorem in Phy&s;ic or natural Science.</P>
<P>The Un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s of other Methods, &s;hould
rather be an Encouragement than a Bar to the Trial
of Tar-Water. A young Lady, Daughter to a
worthy Gentleman near <HI>Cork,</HI> had been long af|flicted
with a grievous Pain in her Side, and having
had the be&s;t Advice that could be got, was not
relieved until &s;he drank Tar-Water, which quite
removed her Pain. Some time after &s;he was again
&s;eized with the &s;ame Di&s;order, but returning to the
U&s;e of Tar-Water, &s;he grew well and &s;till con|tinues
&s;o.</P>
<P>A Woman turned out of the Infirmary at <HI>Cork,</HI>
as incurable, becau&s;e &s;he would not &s;ubmit to the
cutting off her Leg, came to, <HI>Cloyne,</HI> where &s;he
continued half a Year drinking Tar-Water, and
living upon Bread and Milk, by which Cour&s;e &s;he
recovered, and went to Service.</P>
<P>There is at pre&s;ent, while I am writing, a mo&s;t
remarkable Ca&s;e here at <HI>Cloyne,</HI> of a poor Soldier
in a Drop&s;y, who&s;e Belly was &s;woln to a mo&s;t im|moderate
Size. He &s;aid he had been five Months
in an Ho&s;pital at <HI>Dublin,</HI> and having tried other
Methods in vain, left it to avoid being tapped. It
is a Fortnight &s;ince he came to <HI>Cloyne,</HI> during which
Time he hath drunk two Quarts of Tar-Water
every Day. His Belly is now quite reduced: his
Appetite and Sleep which were gone are re&s;tored:
he gathers Strength every Moment: and he who
was de&s;paired of, &s;eems to be quite out of Danger,
both to him&s;elf, and to all who &s;ee him. It is re|markable,
that upon drinking the Tar-Water, he
voided &s;everal Worms of a very extraordinary Size.
This Medicine, which is ob&s;erved to make &s;ome
Per&s;ons co&s;tive, is to hydropic Patients a &s;trong
<PB N="25" REF="24">
Purge. The pre&s;ent is but one of &s;everal In&s;tances,
wherein the Drop&s;y hath been cured by Tar-Water;
which I never knew to fail in any Species of that
Malady.</P>
<P>I am very credibly informed, that an aged
Clergyman of <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> being reduced to
the la&s;t Extremity by the Gout in his Stomach, after
having tried &s;trong Liquors, and the Methods
u&s;ual in that Ca&s;e without Succe&s;s, betook him&s;elf
to drink a va&s;t Quantity of warm Tar-Water, &s;till
repleni&s;hing and letting it take its Cour&s;e; by which
it plea&s;ed God to deliver him from the Jaws of
Death.</P>
<P>A Gentleman in the County of <HI>Clare,</HI> near <HI>Ennis,</HI>
had a Fever and Pleuri&s;y, and Inflammation of the
Lungs, being at the la&s;t Extremity, and given over
by two Phy&s;icians, he was advi&s;ed to drink Tar-Water,
which he did, eight Quarts. Next Morn|ing
one of the Doctors asking at what Hour his
Patient died? to his great Surpri&s;e found he was
recovered. This I had from a Parliament-Man his
Neighbour.</P>
<P>When the yellow Fever (as it was called) raged
in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> the Negroes, with a Tub of
Tar-Water in their Quarters, did well: but &s;ome
of the better Sort mi&s;carried, among whom the
Phy&s;ician him&s;elf lay at the Point of Death; but
his Brother recovered him by pouring down his
Throat in Spoonfuls, &s;ome of the &s;ame Liquor that
recovered the Negroes. The Fact was related to
me by a Gentleman who was then in the I&s;land of
<HI>St. Christopher's,</HI> and knew it to be true.</P>
<P>A Phy&s;ician him&s;elf, not long &s;ince a&s;&s;ured me,
he had cured an Ulcer in the Bladder, by ordering
his Patient to drink Tar-Water, when he had tried
all other Methods in vain, and thought the Case
incurable</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25">
But it would be endle&s;s to relate the Effects of
Tar-Water, in de&s;perate Ca&s;es. The Recovery of
Mrs. <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> Daughter to the late Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI>
from a lingering hopele&s;s Di&s;order, was a noted
Ca&s;e, and atte&s;ted to by his Lord&s;hip. I have
even been informed upon good Authority, of two
or three In&s;tances, wherein Per&s;ons have been re|covered
by Tar-Water, after they had Rattles in
the Throat.</P>
<P>In certain Ca&s;es, a &s;maller Quantity of Tar-Water
hath proved ineffectual, when a larger hath
perfected the Cure. A Woman of <HI>Cloyne</HI> got cold
after Child-bearing, which occa&s;ioned a great Pain
in her Thigh, Swelling al&s;o and Redne&s;s; &s;he con|tinued
in great Torment above three Weeks. She
then began to drink Tar-Water, but not drinking
much &s;he did not perceive much good; and when
there was not any Hopes of her Life, &s;he was per|&s;uaded
to try what a Gallon a Day might do; upon
this &s;he grew better, the Swelling broke and ran; no
Dre&s;&s;ing was u&s;ed but Tar, and no Wa&s;hing but
Tar-Water, until &s;he was quite recovered.</P>
<P>In Ailments of an odd and untried Nature, it
may be worth while to try Tar-Water. In Proof
of this many In&s;tances might be given. A Gentle|man
with a wither'd Arm had it re&s;tored by drink|ing
Tar-Water. Another who, by running his
Head again&s;t a Po&s;t, had a Concu&s;&s;ion of the Brain
attended with very bad Symptoms, recovered by
drinking Tar-Water after other Medicines had failed.
In my own Neighbourhood, one had lo&s;t the u&s;e of
his Limbs by Poi&s;on, another had been bitten by a
mad A&s;s; the&s;e Per&s;ons drank Tar-Water, and their
Cure was attributed to it.</P>
<P>When Tar-Water is copiou&s;ly drank in Fevers,
the great Danger to be guarded again&s;t, is an ex|ce&s;&s;ive
Flow of Spirits, which excites the Patient to
<PB N="27" REF="26">
talk and divert him&s;elf with Company, which may
produce a Relap&s;e; of this I have known fatal
Effects.</P>
<P>If in a Cour&s;e of Tar Water the Patient &s;hould
find him&s;elf heated, let him ab&s;tain from or le&s;&s;en
his Do&s;e of &s;pirituous and fermented Liquors; for
Tar-Water alone never heats.</P>
<P>In chronical Di&s;orders it is not advi&s;eable, to
break off a Cour&s;e of Tar-Water at once, but rather
to dimini&s;h the Quantity by Degrees.</P>
<P>The Acid alone hath not the medicinal Virtues
of Tar-Water. This is agreeable to Rea&s;on and
Experience, as well as the Opinion of the able&s;t
Judges. Doctor <HI>Linden</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves,  <Q REND="inline">"that when
the empyreumatic Oil is entirely &s;eparated from
the Acid, it is not in any Shape &s;uperior to any
other di&s;tilled Acids or Vinegars what&s;oever."</Q>
<BIBL><HI>Treati&s;e on Selter Water,</HI> p. 307.</BIBL></P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Something of this Nature hath been long expected, and hoped for, if we may credit that learned Chymi&s;t Dr. <HI>Linden,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"at la&s;t (&s;aith he) the long delayed Wi&s;hes of the mo&s;t eminent Men of the Faculty are fulfilled, in the B. of <HI>C&mdash;yne</HI>'s Di&s;covery."</Q> <BIBL>See <HI>Treati&s;e on Selter Water,</HI> p. 303.</BIBL> Again (&s;peaking of empyreumatic Oils of Plants) he hath the&s;e Words, <Q REND="inline">"There has always prevailed a Notion among the Chymi&s;ts, and particularly with <HI>Paracel&s;us</HI> and his Fol|lowers, that in tho&s;e Oils there lay a great Secret undi&s;|covered.

ESSAY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHETHER the Pro&s;perity that preceded,
or the Calamities that &s;ucceed the South
Sea Project have mo&s;t contributed to our undoing,
is not &s;o clear a Point as it is that we are actually
undone, and lo&s;t to all Sen&s;e of our true Intere&s;t;
nothing le&s;s than this could render it pardonable, to
have Recour&s;e to tho&s;e old fa&s;hioned trite Maxims
concerning Religion, Indu&s;try, Frugality, and pub|lic
Spirit, which are now forgotten, but if revived
and put in practice, may not only prevent our final
Ruin, but al&s;o render us a more happy and flouri&s;h|ing
People than ever.</P>
<P>Religion hath in former Days been cheri&s;hed and
reverenced by wi&s;e Patriots and Lawgivers, as know|ing
it to be impo&s;&s;ible that a Nation &s;hould thrive
and flouri&s;h without Virtue, or that Virtue &s;hould
&s;ub&s;i&s;t: without Con&s;cience, or Con&s;cience without
Religion: in&s;omuch that an Athei&s;t or Infidel was
looked on with Abhorrence, and treated as an
Enemy to his Country. But in the&s;e wi&s;er Times,
a cold Indifference for the national Religion, and
indeed for all Matters of Faith and divine Wor&s;hip,
is thought good Sen&s;e. It is even become fa&s;hion|able
to decry Religion; and that little Talent of
Ridicule is applied to &s;uch wrong Purpo&s;es, that
<PB N="32" REF="30">
a good Chri&s;tian can hardly keep him&s;elf in Coun|tenance.</P>
<P>Liberty is the greate&s;t human Ble&s;&s;ing that a
virtuous Man can po&s;&s;e&s;s, and is very con&s;i&s;tent
with the Duties of a good Subject and a good
Chri&s;tian, but the pre&s;ent Age aboundeth with in|judicious
Patrons of Liberty, who not di&s;tingui&s;h|ing
between that and Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, take the &s;ure&s;t
Method to di&s;credit what they would &s;eem to pro|pagate;
for, in effect, can there be a greater Affront
offered to that ju&s;t Freedom of Thought and
Action, which is the Prerogative of a rational Crea|ture,
or can any Thing recommend it le&s;s to hone&s;t
Minds than under Colour thereof to obtrude Scur|rility
and Profanene&s;s on the World? But it hath
been always ob&s;erved of weak Men, that they
know not how to avoid one Extreme without run|ning
into another.</P>
<P>Too many of this Sort pa&s;s upon vulgar Read|ers
for great Authors, and Men of profound
Thought, not on account of any Superiority either
in Sen&s;e or Stile, both which they po&s;&s;e&s;s in a very
moderate Degree, nor of any Di&s;coveries they have
made in Arts and Sciences, which they &s;eem to be
little acquainted with: but purely becau&s;e they flatter
the Pa&s;&s;ions of corrupt Men, who are plea&s;ed to
have the Clamours of Con&s;cience &s;ilenced, and tho&s;e
great Points of the Chri&s;tian Religion made &s;u&s;|pected,
which withheld them from many Vices of
Plea&s;ure and Intere&s;t, or made them unea&s;y in the
Commi&s;&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>In order to promote that laudable De&s;ign of
effacing all Sen&s;e of Religion from among us, they
form them&s;elves into A&s;&s;emblies, and proceed with
united Coun&s;els and Endeavours; with what Suc|ce&s;s,
and with what Merit towards the Public, the
Effect too plainly &s;hews; I will not &s;ay, the&s;e
<PB N="33" REF="31">
Gentlemen have formed a direct De&s;ign to ruin
their Country, or that they have the Sen&s;e to &s;ee
half the ill Con&s;equences, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
flow from the &s;preading of their Opinions, but the
Nation feels them, and it is high time the Legi&s;|lature
put a &s;top to them.</P>
<P>I am not for placing an invidious Power in the
Hands of the Clergy, or complying with the nar|rowne&s;s
of any mi&s;taken Zealots, who &s;hould in|cline
to per&s;ecute Di&s;&s;enters: but whatever Conduct,
common Sen&s;e, as well as Chri&s;tian Charity obligeth
us to u&s;e, towards tho&s;e who differ from us in &s;ome
Points of Religion, yet the public Safety requireth,
that the avowed Contemners of all Religion &s;hould
be &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ed, and perhaps it may be no
ea&s;y matter to a&s;&s;ign a good Rea&s;on why Bla&s;phemy
again&s;t God &s;hould not be inquired into, and pu|ni&s;hed
with the &s;ame Rigour as Trea&s;on again&s;t the
King.</P>
<P>For though we may attempt to patch up our
Affairs, yet it will be to no Purpo&s;e, the Finger of
God will unravel all our vain Projects, and make
them Snares to draw us into greater Calamities, if
we do not reform that &s;candalous Libertini&s;m which
(whatever &s;ome &s;hallow Men may think) is our
wor&s;t Symptom and the &s;ure&s;t Progno&s;tic of our
Ruin.</P>
<P>Indu&s;try is the natural &s;ure Way to Wealth; this
is &s;o true, that it is impo&s;&s;ible an indu&s;trious free
People &s;hould want the Nece&s;&s;aries and Comforts of
Life, or an idle enjoy them under any Form of
Government. Money is &s;o far u&s;eful to the Public,
as it promoteth Indu&s;try, and Credit having the
&s;ame Effect, is of the &s;ame Value with Money; but
Money or Credit circulating through a Nation
from hand to hand without producing Labour and
Indu&s;try in the Inhabitants, is direct Gaming.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="32">
It is not impo&s;&s;ible for cunning Men to make
&s;uch plau&s;ible Schemes, as may draw tho&s;e who are
le&s;s skilful into their own and the public Ruin.
But &s;urely there is no Man of Sen&s;e and Hone&s;ty,
but mu&s;t &s;ee and own, whether he under&s;tands the
Game or not, that it is an evident Folly for any
People, in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting the old hone&s;t
Methods of Indu&s;try and Frugality, to &s;it down to
a public Gaming-table, and play off their Money
one to another.</P>
<P>The more Methods there are in a State for ac|quiring
Riches without Indu&s;try or Merit, the le&s;s
there will be of either in that State; this is as evi|dent
as the Ruin that attends it. Be&s;ides, when
Money is &s;hifted from hand to hand in &s;uch a
blind fortuitous Manner, that &s;ome Men &s;hall from
nothing in an in&s;tant acquire va&s;t E&s;tates, without
the lea&s;t De&s;ert; while others are as &s;uddenly &s;tript
of plentiful Fortunes, and left on the Pari&s;h by their
own Avarice and Credulity, what can be hoped for
on the one hand, but abandoned Luxury and
Wantonne&s;s, or on the other, but extreme Mad|ne&s;s
and De&s;pair.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, all Project for growing rich by &s;udden
and extraordinary Methods, as they operate violent|ly
on the Pa&s;&s;ions of Men, and encourage them
to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;low moderate Gains that are to be
made by an hone&s;t Indu&s;try, mu&s;t be ruinous to the
Public, and even the Winners them&s;elves will at
length be involved in the public Ruin.</P>
<P>It is an ea&s;y matter to contrive Projects for the
Encouragement of Indu&s;try; I wi&s;h it were as ea&s;y
to per&s;uade Men to put them in Practice. There
is no Country in Europe where there is &s;o much
Charity collected for the Poor, and none where it is
&s;o ill managed. If the Poor-tax was fixed at a
Medium in every Pari&s;h, taken from a Calculation
<PB N="35" REF="33">
of the la&s;t ten Years, and rai&s;ed for &s;even Years by
Act of Parliament, that Sum (if the common
E&s;timate be not very wrong) frugally and pru|dently
laid out in Work-hou&s;es, would for ever
free the Nation from the Care of providing for the
Poor, and at the &s;ame time con&s;iderably improve
our Manufactures. We might by the&s;e means rid
our Streets of Beggars, even the Children, the
maimed and the blind, might be put in a way of
doing &s;omething for their Livelihood. As for the
&s;mall Number of tho&s;e, who by Age or Infirmities
are utterly incapable of all Employment, they
might be maintained by the Labour of others; and
the Public would receive no &s;mall Advantage from
the Indu&s;try of tho&s;e, who are now &s;o great a
Burden and Expence to it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Tax, continued three Years longer,
might be very u&s;efully employed in making high
Roads, and rendering Rivers navigable, two Things
of &s;o much Profit and Ornament to a Nation, that
we &s;eem the only People in <HI>Europe</HI> Who have neg|lected
them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was publi&s;hed before Turnpikes were erected.</NOTE>. So that in the &s;pace of ten Years
the Public may be for ever freed from a heavy Tax,
Indu&s;try encouraged, Commerce facilitated, and
the whole Country improved, and all this only by
a frugal hone&s;t Management, without rai&s;ing one
Peny extraordinary.</P>
<P>The Number of People is both Means and Mo|tives
to Indu&s;try; it &s;hould therefore be of great
u&s;e to encourage Propagation, by allowing &s;ome
Reward or Privilege to tho&s;e who have a certain
Number of Children; and on the other hand, en|acting
that the Public &s;hall inherit half the unin|tailed
E&s;tates of all who die unmarried of either
Sex.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="34">
Be&s;ides the immediate End propo&s;ed by the fore|going
Methods, they furni&s;h Taxes upon Pa&s;&s;en|gers,
and dead Bachelors, which are in no &s;ort
grievous to the Subject, and may be applied towards
clearing the public Debt, which, all Mankind agree,
highly concerneth the Nation in general, both Court
and Country. <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> indeed, mentions it as a Piece
of Policy, that he borrowed Money from his Officers
to be&s;tow it on the Soldiers, which fixed both to
his Intere&s;t; and though &s;omething like this may
pa&s;s for Skill at certain Junctures in civil Govern|ment,
yet if carried too far, it will prove a dan|gerous
Experiment.</P>
<P>There is &s;till Room for Invention or Improve|ment
in mo&s;t Trades and Manufactures, and it is
probable, that Praemiums given on that Account to
ingenious Arti&s;ts, would &s;oon be re-paid an hundred-fold
to the Public. No Colour is &s;o much wore
in <HI>Italy, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> as Black; but our
black Cloth is neither &s;o la&s;ting, nor of &s;o good a
Dye as the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which is the Rea&s;on of their in|gro&s;&s;ing
the Profit of that Trade; this is &s;o true,
that I have known <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants abroad wear
black Cloth of <HI>Holland</HI> them&s;elves, and &s;ell and re|commend
it as better than that of their own
Country. It is commonly &s;aid the Water of <HI>Leyden</HI>
hath a peculiar Property for colouring Black, but it
hath been al&s;o &s;aid and pa&s;&s;ed current, that good
Gla&s;&s;es may be made no where but at <HI>Venice,</HI> and
there only in the I&s;land of <HI>Murano:</HI> which was at|tributed
to &s;ome peculiar Property in the Air; and
we may po&s;&s;ibly find other Opinions of that &s;ort
to be as groundle&s;s, &s;hould the Legi&s;lature think it
worth while to propo&s;e Praemiums in the foregoing,
or in the like Ca&s;es of general Benefit to the Public;
but I remember to have &s;een, about &s;even Years ago,
a Man pointed at in a Coffee-Hou&s;e, who (they &s;aid)
<PB N="37" REF="35">
had fir&s;t introduced the right &s;carlet Dye among us,
by which the Nation in general, as well as many
private Per&s;ons, have &s;ince been great Gainers
though he was him&s;elf a Beggar, who, if this be
true, de&s;erved an honourable Maintenance from the
Public.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o &s;everal Manufactures which we
have from abroad, that may be carried on to as
great Perfection here as el&s;ewhere. If it be con|&s;idered
that more fine Linen is wore in <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
than in any other Country of <HI>Europe,</HI> it will be
difficult to a&s;&s;ign a Rea&s;on why Paper may not be
made here as good, and in the &s;ame Quantity, as in
<HI>Holland,</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Genoa.</HI> This is a Manu|facture
of great Con&s;umption, and would &s;ave much
to the Public. The like may be &s;aid of Tape&s;try,
Lace, and other Manufactures, which is &s;et on foot
in cheap Parts of the Country, would employ many
Hands, and &s;ave Money to the Nation, as well as
bring it from abroad. Projects for improving old
Manufactures, or &s;etting up new ones, &s;hould not
be de&s;pi&s;ed in a trading Country, but the making
them Pretences for Stockjobbing hath been a fatal
Impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>As Indu&s;try dependeth upon Trade, and this, as
well as the public Security, upon our Navigation,
it concerneth the Legi&s;lature to provide, that the
Number of our Sailors do not decrea&s;e, to which it
would very much conduce, if a Law were made
prohibiting the Payment of Sailors in foreign Parts;
for it is u&s;ual with tho&s;e on board Merchant-Men
as &s;oon as they &s;et foot on Shore to receive their
Pay, which is &s;oon &s;pent in riotous Living; and
when they have emptied their Pockets, the Tempta|tion
of a Pi&s;tole pre&s;ent Money, never faileth to
draw them into any foreign Service. To this, (if
I may credit the Information I have had from &s;ome
<PB N="38" REF="36">
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factors abroad) it is chiefly owing, that
the <HI>Venetians, Spaniards,</HI> and others, have &s;o many
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> on board their Ships; &s;ome Merchants
indeed and Ma&s;ters of Ve&s;&s;els may make a Profit
in defrauding tho&s;e poor Wretches when they pay
them in &s;trange Coin (which I have been a&s;&s;ured
often amounts to twelve Pence in the Crown) as well
as in ridding them&s;elves of the Charge of keeping
them when they &s;ell their Ships, or &s;tay long in
Port, but the Public lo&s;e both the Money and the
Men; who, if their Arrears were to be cleared at
home, would be &s;ure to return, and &s;pend them in
their own Country: It is a Shame this Abu&s;e &s;hould
not be remedied.</P>
<P>Frugality of Manners is the Nouri&s;hment and
Strength of Bodies politic. It is that by which
they grow and &s;ub&s;i&s;t, until they are corrupted by
Luxury; the natural Cau&s;e of their Decay and Ruin.
Of this we have Examples in the <HI>Per&s;ians, Lace|daemonians,</HI>
and <HI>Romans:</HI> not to mention many later
Governments which have &s;prung up, continued a
while, and then peri&s;hed by the &s;ame natural Cau&s;es.
But the&s;e are, it &s;eems, of no u&s;e to us; and, in
&s;pite of them, we are in a fair Way of becoming
our&s;elves, another u&s;ele&s;s Example to future Ages.</P>
<P>Men are apt to mea&s;ure national Pro&s;perity by
Riches, it would be righter to mea&s;ure it by the
U&s;e that is made of them. Where they promote
an hone&s;t Commerce among Men, and are Motives
to Indu&s;try and Virtue, they are without doubt of
great Advantage; but where they are made (as too
often happens) an In&s;trument to Luxury, they
enervate and di&s;pirit the brave&s;t People. So ju&s;t is
that Remark of <HI>Machiavel,</HI> that there is no Truth
in the common Saying, Money is the Nerves of
War; and though we may &s;ub&s;i&s;t tolerably for a
Time among corrupt Neighbours, yet if ever we
<PB N="39" REF="37">
have to do with a hardy, temperate, religious Sort
of Men, we &s;hall find to our Co&s;t, that all our
Riches are but a poor Exchange for that Simplicity
of Manners which we de&s;pi&s;e in our Ance&s;tors.
This &s;ole Advantage hath been the main Support of
all the Republics that have made a Figure in the
World; and perhaps it might be no ill Policy in a
Kingdom to form it&s;elf upon the Manners of a
Republic.</P>
<P>Simplicity of Manners may be more ea&s;ily pre|&s;erved
in a Republic than a Monarchy; but if once
lo&s;t, may be &s;ooner recovered in a Monarchy, the
Example of a Court being of great Efficacy, either
to reform or to corrupt a People; that alone were
&s;ufficient to di&s;countenance the wearing of Gold or
Silver, either in Cloaths or Equipage, and it the
&s;ame were prohibited by Law, the &s;aving &s;o much
Bullion would be the &s;malle&s;t Benefit of &s;uch an
In&s;titution; there being nothing more apt to deba&s;e
the Virtue and good Sen&s;e of our Gentry of both
Sexes, than the trifling Vanity of Apparel, which
we have learned from <HI>France,</HI> and which hath had
&s;uch vi&s;ible ill Con&s;equences on the Genius of that
People. Wi&s;er Nations have made it their Care to
&s;hut out this Folly by &s;evere Laws and Penalties, and
its &s;preading among us can forbode no good, if
there be any Truth in the Ob&s;ervation of one of the
Ancients, that the direct Way to ruin a Man is to
dre&s;s him up in fine Cloaths.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied that Luxury of Dre&s;s giveth
a light Behaviour to our Women, which may pa&s;s
for a &s;mall Offence, becau&s;e it is a common one, but
is in truth the Source of great Corruptions. For
this very Offence the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> denounced a
&s;evere Judgment again&s;t the Ladies of his Time.
I &s;hall give the Pa&s;&s;age at length; <Q REND="inline">'Moreover, the
LORD &s;aith, becau&s;e the Daughters of <HI>Zion</HI> are
<PB N="40" REF="38">
haughty, and walk with &s;tretched forth Necks
and wanton Eyes, walking and mincing as they
go, and making a Tinkling with their Feet;
therefore the LORD will &s;mite with a Scab the
Crown of the Head of the Daughters of <HI>Zion,</HI>
and the LORD will di&s;cover their &s;ecret Parts. In
that Day the Lord will take away the Bravery
of their tinkling Ornaments about their Feet, and
their Cauls, and their round Tires like the Moon,
the Chains, and the Bracelets, and the Mufflers,
the Bonnets, and the Ornaments of the Legs, and
the Head-bands, and the Tablets, and the Earrings,
the Rings, and No&s;e jewels, the change|able
Suits of Apparel, and the Mantles, and the
Wimples, and the cri&s;ping Pins, the Gla&s;&s;es, and
the fine Linen, and the Hoods and the Vails.
And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s that in&s;tead of a &s;weet
Smell there &s;hall be a Stink; and in&s;tead of a
Girdle a Rent; and in&s;tead of well-&s;et Hair, Bald|ne&s;s;
and in&s;tead of a Stomacher, a Girding of
Sackcloth; and Burning in&s;tead of Beauty:'</Q> The
Scab, the Stench, and the Burning are terrible
pe&s;tilential Symptoms, and our Ladies would do
well to con&s;ider, they may chance to re&s;emble tho&s;e
of <HI>Zion,</HI> in their Puni&s;hment as well as their
Offence.</P>
<P>But Dre&s;s is not the only Thing to be reformed,
&s;umptuary Laws are u&s;eful in many other Points.
In former Times the natural Plainne&s;s and good
Sen&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> made them le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary. But
ever &s;ince the luxurious Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the
&s;econd, we have been doing violence to our Na|tures,
and are by this time &s;o much altered for
the wor&s;e, that it is to be feared, the very &s;ame
Di&s;po&s;itions that make them nece&s;&s;ary, will for
ever hinder them from being enacted or put in
Execution.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="39">
A private Family in difficult Circum&s;tances, all
Men agree, ought to melt down their Plate, walk
on Foot, retrench the Number of their Servants,
wear neither Jewels nor rich Cloaths, and deny
them&s;elves expen&s;ive Diver&s;ions; and why not the
Public? had any Thing like this been done, our
Taxes had been le&s;s, or which is the &s;ame thing,
we &s;hould have felt them le&s;s. But it is very re|markable,
that Luxury was never at &s;o great a
Height, nor &s;pread &s;o generally through the Na|tion,
as during the Expence of the late Wars, and
the heavy Debt that &s;till lieth upon us.</P>
<P>This Vice draweth after it a Train of Evils
which cruelly infe&s;t the Public; Faction, Ambi|tion,
Envy, Avarice, and that of the wor&s;t kind,
being much more hurtful in its Con&s;equences,
though not &s;o infamous as Penury. It was the
great Art of Cardinal <HI>Richelieu,</HI> by encouraging
Luxury and Expence to impoveri&s;h the <HI>French</HI> No|bility,
and render them altogether dependent on
the Crown, which hath been &s;ince very &s;ucce&s;sfully
effected. The&s;e and many more Con&s;iderations
&s;hew the Nece&s;&s;ity there is for &s;umptuary Laws,
nor can any thing be &s;aid again&s;t them in this
I&s;land, which might not with equal Force be ob|jected

judged the public Benefit of &s;uch In&s;titutions, to be
of far greater Importance than the &s;hort Sufferings
of a few, who &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the Luxury of others.</P>
<P>It is evident, that old Taxes may be better born,
as well as new ones rai&s;ed by &s;umptuary Laws ju|diciou&s;ly
framed, not to damage our Trade, but
retrench our Luxury. It is evident, that for want
of the&s;e, Luxury (which, like the other Fa&s;hions,
never faileth to de&s;cend) hath infected all Ranks of
People, and that this enableth the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI>
to under&s;ell us, to the great Prejudice of our
<PB N="42" REF="40">
Traffic. We cannot but know that in our pre&s;ent
Circum&s;tances, it &s;hould be our Care, as it is our
Intere&s;t to make Poverty tolerable; in &s;hort we
have the Experience of many Ages to convince us,
that a corrupt luxurious People mu&s;t of them&s;elves
fall into Slavery, although no Attempt be made
upon them. The&s;e and the like obvious Reflecti|ons
&s;hould, one would think, have forced any
People in their Sen&s;es upon frugal Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>But we are doomed to be undone. Neither the
plain Rea&s;on of the Thing, nor the Experience of
pa&s;t Ages, nor the Examples we have before our
Eyes, can re&s;train us from imitating, not to &s;ay
&s;urpa&s;&s;ing, the mo&s;t corrupt and ruined People, in
tho&s;e very Points of Luxury that ruined them.
Our Gaming, our Operas, our Maskerades, are,
in spite of our Debts and Poverty, become the
Wonder of our Neighbours. If there be
any Man &s;o void of all Thought and common Sen&s;e,
as not to &s;ee where this mu&s;t end, let him but com|pare
what <HI>Venice</HI> was at the League of <HI>Cambray,</HI>
with what it is at pre&s;ent, and he will be convinced,
how truly tho&s;e fa&s;hionable Pa&s;times are calculated
to depre&s;s and ruin a Nation.</P>
<P>But neither <HI>Venice</HI> nor <HI>Paris,</HI> nor any other
Town in any Part of the World, ever knew &s;uch
an expen&s;ive ruinous Folly as our Maskerade.
This alone is &s;ufficient to inflame and &s;atisfy the &s;e|veral
Appetites for Gaming, Dre&s;&s;ing, Intriguing,
luxurious Eating and Drinking. It is a mo&s;t skil|ful
Abridgment, the very Quinte&s;&s;ence, the ab&s;tract
of all tho&s;e &s;en&s;ele&s;s Vanities, that have ever been
the Ruin of Fools and Dete&s;tation of wi&s;e Men.
And all this under the Notion of an elegant Enter|tainment,
hath been admitted among us; though
it be in truth a Contagion of the wor&s;t Kind.

not to &s;ay, that general Corruption of

towards it, that, if the Wi&s;dom of the Legi&s;lature

no more than by tho&s;e <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Follies,

by an ab&s;olute Prohibition of tho&s;e which have a

headlong into all tho&s;e luxurious Follies, which, it
is evident, have been fatal to other Nations, and
will undoubtedly prove fatal to us al&s;o, if a timely
Stop be not put to them.</P>
<P>Public Spirit, that glorious Principle of all that
is great and good, is &s;o far from being cheri&s;hed
or encouraged, that it is become ridiculous in this
enlightened Age, which is taught to laugh at every
Thing that is &s;erious as well as &s;acred. The &s;ame
athei&s;tical narrow Spirit, centring all our Cares upon
private Intere&s;t, and contracting all our Hopes
within the Enjoyment of this pre&s;ent Life, equally
produceth a Neglect of what we owe to God and
our Country. <HI>Tully</HI> hath long &s;ince ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"that
it is impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e, who have no Belief of
the Immortality of the Soul or a future State
of Rewards and Puni&s;hments, to &s;acrifice their
particular Intere&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions to the public
Good, or have a generous Concern for Po&s;te|rity,"</Q>
and our own Experience confirmeth the
Truth of this Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In order therefore to recover a Sen&s;e of public
Spirit, it is to be wi&s;hed that Men were fir&s;t affect|ed
with a true Sen&s;e of Religion; <HI>pro aris &amp; focis,</HI>
having ever been the great Motive to Courage and
Per&s;everance in a public Cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="43">
It would likewi&s;e be a very u&s;eful Policy, and
warranted by the Example of the wi&s;e&s;t Govern|ments,
to make the natural Love of Fame and Re|putation
&s;ub&s;ervient to promoting that noble Prin|ciple.
Triumphal Arches, Columns, Statues, In|&s;criptions,
and the like Monuments of public Ser|vices,
have in former Times been found great In|centives
to Virtue and Magnanimity, and would
probably have the &s;ame Effects on <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> which
they have had on <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI> And per|haps
a Pillar of Infamy would be found a proper
and exemplary Puni&s;hment in Ca&s;es of &s;ignal pub|lic
Villany, where the Lo&s;s of Fortune, Liberty,
or Life, are not proportioned to the Crime; or,
where the Skill of the Offender, or the Nature of
his Offence, may skreen him from the Letter of
the Law.</P>
<P>Several of the&s;e are to be &s;een at <HI>Genoa, Milan,</HI>
and other Towns of <HI>Italy,</HI> where it is the Cu&s;tom
to demoli&s;h the Hou&s;e of a Citizen, who hath con|&s;pired
the Ruin of his Country, or been guilty of
any enormous Crime towards the Public, and in
place thereof to erect a Monument of the Crime,
and Criminal de&s;cribed, in the blacke&s;t manner.
We have nothing of this &s;ort, that I know, but
that which is commonly called the Monument,
which in the la&s;t Age was erected for an Affair
no way more atrocious than the modern unex|ampled
Attempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>South-Sea</HI> Project.</NOTE> of Men ea&s;y in their Fortunes,
and unprovoked by Hard&s;hips of any &s;ort, in cool
Blood, and with open Eyes to ruin their native
Country. This Fact will never be forgotten, and
it were to be wi&s;hed that with it the public Dete&s;|tation
thereof may be tran&s;mitted to Po&s;terity,
which would in &s;ome mea&s;ure vindicate the Honour
<PB N="46" REF="44">
of the pre&s;ent, and be a u&s;eful Le&s;&s;on to future
Ages.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e noble Arts of Architecture, Sculpture,
and Paintings do not only adorn the Public, but
have al&s;o an Influence on the Minds and Manners
of Men, filling them with great Ideas, and &s;pirit|ing
them up to an Emulation of worthy Actions.
For this Cau&s;e they were cultivated and encourag|ed
by the <HI>Greek</HI> Cities, who vied with each other
in building and adorning their Temples, Theatres,
Porticos, and the like public Works, at the &s;ame
Time that they di&s;couraged private Luxury, the
very Rever&s;e of our Conduct.</P>
<P>To propo&s;e the building a Parliament Hou&s;e,
Courts of Ju&s;tice, Royal Palace, and other public
Edifices, &s;uitable to the Dignity of the Nation, and
adorning them with Paintings and Statues, which
may tran&s;mit memorable Things and Per&s;ons to
Po&s;terity, would probably be laughed at as a vain
Affair, of great Expence, and little U&s;e to the
Public; and it mu&s;t be owned, we have reduced
our&s;elves to &s;uch Straits, that any Propo&s;ition of
Expence-&s;uiteth ill with our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances.
But how proper &s;oever this Propo&s;al may be for
the Times, yet it comes &s;o properly into a Di&s;cour&s;e
of public Spirit, that I could not but &s;ay &s;omething
of it. And at another Time it will not &s;eem un|rea&s;onable,
if we con&s;ider that it is no more than
the wi&s;e&s;t Nations have done before us, that it would
&s;pirit up new Arts, employ many Hands, keep the
Money circulating at home, and la&s;tly, that it would
be a notable In&s;tance of public Spirit, as well as a
Motive to it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame noble Principle may be al&s;o encou|raged
by erecting an Academy of ingenious Men,
who&s;e Employment it would be to compile the
Hi&s;tory of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to make Di&s;cour&s;es pro|per
<PB N="47" REF="45">
to in&s;pire Men with a Zeal for the Public, and
celebrate the Memory of tho&s;e who have been Or|naments
to the Nation, or done it eminent Service.
Not to mention that this would improve our Lan|guage,
and amu&s;e &s;ome bu&s;y Spirits of the Age;
which perhaps would be no ill Policy.</P>
<P>This is not without Example; for to &s;ay nothing
of the <HI>French</HI> Academy, which is pro&s;tituted to
meaner Purpo&s;es, it hath been the Cu&s;tom of the
<HI>Venetian</HI> Senate to appoint one of their Order to con|tinue
the Hi&s;tory of the Republic. This was intro|duced
in the flouri&s;hing State of that People, and is
&s;till in force. We fall &s;hort of other Nations in
the Number of good Hi&s;torians, though no Nation
in Chri&s;tendom hath produced greater Events, or
more worthy to be recorded. The <HI>Athenian</HI> Senate
appointed Orators to commemorate annually, tho&s;e
who died in Defence of their Country, which Solem|nity
was performed at the Monuments erected in Ho|nour
of them by the Public; and the Panegyrics,
compo&s;ed by <HI>I&s;ocrates</HI> and <HI>Pericles,</HI> as well as
many Pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Tully,</HI> inform us with what Plea|&s;ure
the ancient Orators u&s;ed to expatiate in Prai&s;e
of their Country.</P>
<P>Concord and Union among our&s;elves is rather to
be hoped for, as an Effect, of public Spirit, than
propo&s;ed as a Means to promote it. Candid, ge|nerous
Men, who are true Lovers of their Coun|try,
can never be Enemies to one half of their
Countrymen, or carry their Re&s;entment &s;o far as to
ruin the Public for the &s;ake of a Party. Now I
have fallen upon the mention of our Parties, I &s;hall
beg leave to in&s;ert a Remark or two, for the Ser|vice
both of Whig and Tory, without entering
into their re&s;pective Merits. Fir&s;t, it is impo&s;&s;ible
for either Party to ruin the other, without involv|ing
them&s;elves and their Po&s;terity in the &s;ame Ruin.
<PB N="48" REF="46">
Secondly, it is very fea&s;ible for either Paty to get
the better of the other, if they could fir&s;t get the
better of them&s;elves; and in&s;tead of indulging the
little womani&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions of Ob&s;tinacy, Re&s;entment,
and Revenge, &s;teadily promote the true Intere&s;t of
their Country, in tho&s;e great clear Points of Piety,
Indu&s;try, Sobriety of Manners, and an hone&s;t Re|gard
for Po&s;terity; which, all Men of Sen&s;e agree,
are e&s;&s;ential to public Happine&s;s. There would be
&s;omething &s;o great and good in this Conduct, as
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily overbear all Calumny and Oppo|&s;ition.
But that Men &s;hould act rea&s;onably, is ra|ther
to be wi&s;hed than hoped.</P>
<P>I am well aware, that to talk of public Spirit,
and the Means of retrieving it, mu&s;t to narrow &s;or|did
Minds be matter of Je&s;t and Ridicule, how con|formable
&s;oever it be to right Rea&s;on, and the
Maxims of Antiquity. Though one would think,
the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h Man might &s;ee it was their Intere&s;t
to encourage a Spirit in others, by which they, to
be &s;ure, mu&s;t be Gainers. Yet &s;uch is the Corrup|tion
and Folly of the pre&s;ent Age, that a public
Spirit is treated like Ignorance of the World, and
want of Sen&s;e; and all the Re&s;pect is paid to cun|ning
Men, who bend and wre&s;t the public Intere&s;t
to their own private Ends, that in other Times
hath been thought due to tho&s;e who were generous
enough to &s;acrifice their private Intere&s;t to that of
their Country.</P>
<P>Such Practices and &s;uch Maxims as the&s;e mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily ruin a State. But if the contrary
&s;hould prevail, we may hope to &s;ee Men in Power
prefer the public Wealth and Security to their own,
and Men of Money make free Gifts, or lend it
without Intere&s;t to their Country. This, how
&s;trange and incredible &s;oever it may &s;eem to us,
hath been often done in other States. And the
<PB N="49" REF="47">
natural <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Temper con&s;idered, together with
the Force of Example, no one can tell how far a
Propo&s;al for a free Gift may go among the moneyed
Men, when &s;et on foot by the Legi&s;lature, and
encouraged by the Example of two or three Men
of Figure, who have the Spirit to do a generous
Thing, and the Under&s;tanding to &s;ee it is every
private Man's Intere&s;t to &s;upport that of the Public.</P>
<P>If they who have their Fortunes in Money &s;hould
make a voluntary Gift, the Public would be ea&s;ed,
and at the &s;ame time maintain its Credit. Nor
is a generous Love of their Country the only Motive
that &s;hould induce them to this. Common Equity
requires, that all Subjects &s;hould equally &s;hare the
public Burden. And common Sen&s;e &s;hews, that
tho&s;e who are foremo&s;t in the Danger, &s;hould not
be the mo&s;t backward in contributing to prevent it.</P>
<P>Before I leave this Subject, I cannot but take
notice of that mo&s;t infamous Practice of Bribery,
than which nothing can be more oppo&s;ite to public
Spirit, &s;ince every one who takes a Bribe plainly
owns, that he prefers his private Intere&s;t to that of
his Country. This Corruption is become a national
Crime, having infected the lowe&s;t as well as the
highe&s;t among us, and is &s;o general and notorious,
that, as it cannot be matched in former Ages, &s;o it
is to be hoped it will not be imitated by Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>This calls to mind another national Guilt, which
we po&s;&s;e&s;s in a very eminent Degree; there being
no Nation under the Sun, where &s;olemn Perjury
is &s;o common, or where there are &s;uch Temptations
to it. The making Men &s;wear &s;o often in their
own Ca&s;es, and where they have an Intere&s;t to con|ceal
the Truth, hath gradually wore off that awful
Re&s;pect which was once thought due to an Appeal
to Almighty God; in&s;omuch, that Men now a
Days break their Fa&s;t, and a Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Oath
<PB N="50" REF="48">
with the &s;ame Peace of Mind. It is a Policy pe|culiar
to us, the obliging Men to perjure or betray
them&s;elves, and hath had no one good Effect, but
many very ill ones. Sure I am, that other Nations,
without the hundredth Part of our Swearing, con|trive
to do their Bu&s;ine&s;s, at lea&s;t as well as we do.
And perhaps our Legi&s;lature will think it proper to
follow their Example. For whatever Mea&s;ures are
taken, &s;o long as we lie under &s;uch a Load of Guilt,
as national Perjury and national Bribery, it is im|po&s;&s;ible
we can pro&s;per.</P>
<P>This poor Nation hath &s;orely &s;marted of late,
and to ea&s;e the pre&s;ent Smart, a &s;udden Remedy
(as is u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es) hath been thought of.
But we mu&s;t beware not to mi&s;take an Anodyne
for a Cure. Where the Vitals are touched, and the
whole Ma&s;s of Humours vitiated, it is not enough
to ea&s;e the Part pained, we mu&s;t look further, and
apply general Correctives; otherwi&s;e the ill Hu|mour
may &s;oon &s;hew it&s;elf in &s;ome other Part.</P>
<P>The <HI>South-Sea</HI> Affair, how &s;en&s;ible &s;oever, is not
the original Evil, or the great Source of our Mi&s;|fortunes,
it is but the natural Effect of tho&s;e Prin|ciples,
which for many Years have been propagated
with great Indu&s;try. And as a &s;harp Di&s;temper, by
reclaiming a Man from Intemperance, may pro|long
his Life, &s;o it is not impo&s;&s;ible but this pub|lic
Calamity that lies &s;o heavy on the Nation may
prevent its Ruin. It would certainly prove the
greate&s;t of Ble&s;&s;ings, if it &s;hould make all hone&s;t
Men of one Party; if it &s;hould put Religion and
Virtue in Countenance, re&s;tore a Sen&s;e of public
Spirit, and convince Men it is a dangerous Folly to
pur&s;ue private Aims in Oppo&s;ition to the Good of
their Country, if it &s;hould turn our Thoughts from
Cozenage and Stock-jobbing, to Indu&s;try and
frugal Methods of Life; in fine, if it &s;hould re|vive
<PB N="51" REF="49">
and inflame that native Spark of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Worth
and Honour, which hath too long lain &s;mothered
and oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>With this View I have, among &s;o many Projects
for remedying the ill State of our Affairs in a par|ticular
In&s;tance, ventured to publi&s;h the foregoing
general Hints, which as they have been thrown to|gether
from a Zeal for the public Good, &s;o I heartily
wi&s;h they may be regarded neither more nor le&s;s,
than as they are fitted to promote that End.</P>
<P>Though it mu&s;t be owned, that little can be
hoped if we con&s;ider the corrupt degenerate Age we
live in. I know it is an old Folly to make peevi&s;h
Complaints of the Times, and charge the common
Failures of human Nature on a particular Age.
One may neverthele&s;s venture to affirm, that the
pre&s;ent hath brought forth new and portentous Vil|lanies,
not to be paralleled in our own or any other
Hi&s;tory. We have been long preparing for &s;ome
great Cata&s;trophe. Vice and Villany have by
degrees grown reputable among us; our Infidels
have pa&s;&s;ed for fine Gentlemen, and our venal
Traitors for Men of Sen&s;e, who knew the World.
We have made a Je&s;t of public Spirit, and cancelled
all Re&s;pect for whatever our Laws and Religion re|pute
&s;acred. The old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mode&s;ty is quite
worn off, and in&s;tead of blu&s;hing for our Crimes,
we are a&s;hamed only of Piety and Virtue. In &s;hort,
other Nations have been wicked, but we are the
fir&s;t who have been wicked upon Principle.</P>
<P>The Truth is, our Symptoms are &s;o bad, that
notwith&s;tanding all the Care and Vigilance of the
Legi&s;lature, it is to be feared the final Period of our
State approaches. Strong Con&s;titutions, whether
politic or natural, do not feel light Di&s;orders. But,
when they are &s;en&s;ibly affected, the Di&s;temper is for
the mo&s;t part violent and of an ill Progno&s;tic.
<PB N="52" REF="50">
Free Governments like our own were planted by
the <HI>Goths</HI> in mo&s;t Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> and though we
all know what they are come to, yet we &s;eem
di&s;po&s;ed rather to follow their Example, than to
profit by it.</P>
<P>Whether it be in the Order of Things, that civil
States &s;hould have, like natural Products, their
&s;everal Periods of Growth, Perfection, and Decay;
or whether it be an Effect, as &s;eems more probable,
of human Folly, that as Indu&s;try produces Wealth,
&s;o Wealth &s;hould produce Vice, and Vice Ruin.</P>
<P>God grant the Time be not near, when Men &s;hall
&s;ay, <Q REND="inline">'This I&s;land was once inhabited by a religious,
brave, &s;incere People, of plain uncorrupt Manners,
re&s;pecting inbred Worth rather than Titles and
Appearances, A&s;&s;ertors of Liberty, Lovers of their
Country, jealous of their own Rights, and unwill|ing
to infringe the Rights of others; Improvers
of Learning and u&s;eful Arts, Enemies to Luxury,
tender of other Mens Lives, and prodigal of their
own; inferior in nothing to the old <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Ro|mans,</HI>
and &s;uperior to each of tho&s;e People in the
Perfections of the other. Such were our Ance&s;tors
during their Ri&s;e and Greatne&s;s; but they de|generated,
grew &s;ervile Flatterers of Men in
Power, adopted Epicurean Notions, became venal&punc;
corrupt, injurious, which drew upon them the
Hatred of God and Man, and occa&s;ioned their
final Ruin.'</Q></P>

ADDRESSED TO
MAGISTRATES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Preten&s;ions and Di&s;cour&s;e of Men,
throughout the&s;e Kingdoms, would, at fir&s;t
View, lead one to think the Inhabitants were all
Politicians; and yet, perhaps, political Wi&s;dom
hath in no Age, or Country, been more talked of,
and le&s;s under&s;tood. Licence is taken for the End
of Government, and popular Humour for its Origin.
No Reverence for the Law, no Attachment to the
Con&s;titution, little Attention to Matters of Con&s;e|quence,
and great Altercation upon Trifles, &s;uch
idle Projects about Religion and Government, as
if the Public had both to choo&s;e, a general Contempt
of all Authority, divine and human, an Indifference
about the prevailing Opinions, whether they tend to
produce Order or Di&s;order, to promote the Empire
of God or the Devil: The&s;e are the Symptoms that
&s;trongly mark the pre&s;ent Age; and this could
never have been the Ca&s;e, if a Neglect of Religion
had not made Way for it.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="53">
When the <HI>Jews</HI> accu&s;ed <HI>Paul</HI> upon religious
Matters and Points of their Law before <HI>Gallio,</HI> the
<HI>Roman</HI> Magi&s;trate; it is &s;aid, that GALLIO <HI>cared
for none of tho&s;e Things.</HI> And, it is to be feared,
there are not a few Magi&s;trates in this Chri&s;tian
Country who think with the &s;ame Indifference on
the subject of Religion. Herein, neverthele&s;s,
they judge ami&s;s, and are much wanting to their
Duty. For, although it be admitted, that the
Magi&s;trate's peculiar Object, is the temporal Wel|fare
of the State; yet, this will by no Means exclude
a proper Care about the prevailing Notions and
Opinions of Religion, which influence the Lives
and Actions of Men, and have therefore a mighty
Effect on the Public. Mens, Behaviour is the Con|&s;equence
on their Principles. Hence it follows, that
in order to make a State thrive and flouri&s;h, Care
mu&s;t be taken, that good Principles be propagated
in the Minds of tho&s;e who compo&s;e it.</P>
<P>It would be vain to depend on the outward Form,
the Con&s;titution, and Structure of a State; while
the Majority are ever governed by their inward
Ways of thinking, which at Times will break out
and &s;hew them&s;elves paramount to all Laws and In|&s;titutions
what&s;oever. It mu&s;t be great Folly there|fore
to overlook Notion, as Matters of &s;mall Mo|ment
to the State; while Experience &s;hews there
is nothing more important; and that a prevailing
Di&s;order in the Principles and Opinions of its
Members, is ever dangerous to Society, and capable
of producing the greate&s;t public Evils.</P>
<P>Man is an Animal, formidable both from his
Pa&s;&s;ions and his Rea&s;on; his Pa&s;&s;ions often urging
him to great Evils, and his Rea&s;on furni&s;hing
Means to atchieve them. To tame this Animal,
and make him amenable to Order, to inure him
to a Sen&s;e of Ju&s;tice and Virtue, to withhold him
<PB N="57" REF="54">
from ill Cour&s;es by Fear, and encourage him in
his Duty by Hopes; in &s;hort, to fa&s;hion and model
him for Society, hath been the Aim of civil and
religious In&s;titutions, and in all Times, the En|deavour
of good and wi&s;e Men. The apte&s;t
Method for attaining this End, hath been always
judged a proper Education.</P>
<P>If Mens Actions are an Effect of their Principles,
that is, of their Notions, their Belief, their Per|&s;ua&s;ions;
it mu&s;t be admitted, that Principles early
&s;own in the Mind, are the Seeds which produce
Fruit and Harve&s;t in the ripe State of Manhood.
How lightly &s;oever &s;ome Men may &s;peak of No|tions;
yet, &s;o long as the Soul governs the Body,
Mens Notions mu&s;t influence their Actions, more
or le&s;s, as they are &s;tronger or weaker; and to
Good or Evil, as they are better or wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Our Notions and Opinions are a con&s;tant Check
on our Appetites, and Balance to our Pa&s;&s;ions;
and, although they may not in every In&s;tance con|trol
and rule, yet they will never fail, &s;trongly to
affect both the one and the other. What is it that
bridles the impetuous De&s;ires of Men? That re|&s;trains
them when they are driven by the mo&s;t vio|lent
Pa&s;&s;ions? In a word, what is it that renders
this World habitable, but the prevailing Notions
of Order, Virtue, Duty and Providence? Some,
perhaps, may imagine, that the Eye of the Ma|gi&s;trate
alone is &s;ufficient to keep Mankind in Awe,
But, if every Man's Heart was &s;et to do all the
Mi&s;chief his Appetite &s;hould prompt him to, as
often as Opportunity and Secrecy pre&s;ented them|&s;elves,
there could be no Living in the World.</P>
<P>And although too many of tho&s;e intru&s;ted with
civil Power, in the&s;e our Days, may be &s;aid with
GALLIO, to <HI>care for none of tho&s;e Things;</HI> and
many more who would pa&s;s for Men of Judgment
<PB N="58" REF="55">
and Knowledge, may look on Notions early im|bibed,
before their Grounds&punc; and Rea&s;ons are ap|prehended
or under&s;tood, to be but mere Pre|judices;
yet this will detract nothing from their
Truth and U&s;efulne&s;s. To place this Matter in a
due Light, I propo&s;e to &s;hew, that a Sy&s;tem of
&s;alutary Notions, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Sup|port
of every civil Con&s;titution. I &s;hall enforce
this Point, by the Te&s;timony of tho&s;e who are
e&s;teemed the wi&s;e&s;t Men; and I &s;hall make &s;ome
Remarks on the modern prevailing Spirit, and the
Tendency of the Maxims of our Times.</P>
<P>Order is nece&s;&s;ary, not only to the Well-Being,
but to the very Being of a State. Now, Order
and Regularity in the Actions of Men, is not an
Effect of Appetite or Pa&s;&s;ion, but of Judgment;
and the Judgment is governed by Notions or
Opinions. There mu&s;t therefore, of Nece&s;&s;ity, in
every State, be a certain Sy&s;tem of &s;alutary Notions,
a prevailing Set of Opinions, acquired either by
private Rea&s;on and Reflexion, or taught and in|&s;tilled
by the general Rea&s;on of the Public, that
is, by the Law of the Land. True it is, that
where Men either cannot, or will not u&s;e their own
Rea&s;on, think and examine for them&s;elves; in &s;uch
Ca&s;e, the Notions taught or in&s;tilled into their
Minds are embraced rather by the Memory, than
the Judgment. Nor will it be any Objection to
&s;ay, that the&s;e are Prejudices; ina&s;much as they are
therefore, neither the le&s;s u&s;eful, nor the le&s;s true,
although their Proofs may not be under&s;tood by all
Men.</P>
<P>Prejudices are Notions, or Opinions, which the
Mind entertains without knowing the Grounds and

Examination. The fir&s;t Notions which take

Duties &s;ocial, moral, and civil, may therefore be
ju&s;tly &s;tiled Prejudices. The Mind of a young
Creature cannot remain empty; if you do not put
into it that which is good, it will be &s;ure to receive
that which is bad.</P>
<P>Do what you can, there will &s;till be a Bias from
Education; and if &s;o, is it not better this Bias
&s;hould lie towards Things laudable and u&s;eful to
Society? This Bias &s;till operates, although it may
not always prevail. The Notions fir&s;t in&s;tilled, have
the earlie&s;t Influence, take the deepe&s;t Root, and
generally are found to give a Colour and Com|plexion
to the &s;ub&s;equent Lives of Men, ina&s;much
as they are in Truth, the great Source of human
Actions. It is not Gold, or Honour, or Power,
that move Men to act, but the Opinions they en|tertain
of tho&s;e Things. Hence it follows, that if
a Magi&s;trate &s;hould &s;ay, No Matter what Notions
Men embrace, I will take heed to their Actions;
therein he &s;hews his Weakne&s;s; for &s;uch as are
Mens Notions, &s;uch will be their Deeds.</P>
<P>For a Man to do, as he would be done by; to
love his Neighbour as him&s;elf; to honour his Su|periors;
to believe that God &s;cans all his Actions,
and will reward or puni&s;h them; and to think,
that he who is guilty of Fal&s;hood, or Inju&s;tice,
hurts him&s;elf more than any one el&s;e: Are not the&s;e
&s;uch Notions, and Principles, as every wife Gover|nor,
or Legi&s;lator, would covet above all Things,
to have firmly rooted in the Mind of every Indi|vidual
under his Care? This is allowed, even by
the Enemies of Religion, who would fain have it
thought the Offspring of State Policy; honouring
its U&s;efulne&s;s at the &s;ame Time that they di&s;parage
its Truth. What, therefore, cannot be acquired
by every Man's Rea&s;oning, mu&s;t be introduced by
Precept, and riveted by Cu&s;tom; that is to &s;ay, the
<PB N="60" REF="57">
Bulk of Mankind mu&s;t in all civilized Societies,
have their Minds by timely In&s;truction well &s;ea&s;on|ed

the Grounds or Proofs thereof be unknown
to them, will neverthele&s;s influence their Conduct,
and &s;o far render them u&s;eful Members of the State,
But, if you &s;trip Men of the&s;e their Notions, or,
if you will, Prejudices, with regard to Mode&s;ty,
Decency, Ju&s;tice, Charity, and the like; you will
&s;oon find them &s;o many Mon&s;ters, utterly unfit for
human Society.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire it may be con&s;idered, that mo&s;t Men want
Lei&s;ure, Opportunity, or Faculties, to derive Con|clu&s;ions
from their Principles, and e&s;tabli&s;h Morality
on a Foundation of human Science. True it is, (as
St. <HI>Paul</HI> ob&s;erves) that <HI>The invi&s;ible Things of God
from the Creation of the World, are clearly &s;een.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ROM. Ch. i. Ver. 20.</NOTE>
And from thence the Duties of natural Religion
may be di&s;covered. But the&s;e Things are &s;een and
di&s;covered by tho&s;e alone who open their Eyes, and
look narrowly for them. Now, if you look through|out
the World, you &s;hall find but few of the&s;e nar|row
In&s;pectors and Inquirers, very few who make
it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to analy&s;e Opinions and pur&s;ue them
to their rational Source, to examine whence Truths
&s;pring, and how they are inferred. In &s;hort, you
&s;hall find all Men full of Opinions, but Knowledge
only in a few.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible from the Nature and Circum|&s;tances
of human Kind, that the Multitude &s;hould
be Philo&s;ophers, or that they &s;hould know Things
in their Cau&s;es. We &s;ee every Day, that the Rules,
or Conclu&s;ions alone, are &s;ufficient for the Shop|keeper
to &s;tate his Account, the Sailor to navigate
his Ship, or the Carpenter to mea&s;ure his Timber;
<PB N="61" REF="58">
none of which under&s;tand the Theory; that is to
&s;ay, the Grounds and Rea&s;ons either of Arithmetic
or Geometry. Even &s;o in moral, political, and
religious Matters, it is manife&s;t, that the Rules and
Opinions early imbibed at the fir&s;t Dawn of Un|der&s;tanding,
and without the lea&s;t Glimp&s;e of
Science, may yet produce excellent Effects, and be
very u&s;eful to the World: And that in Fact they
are &s;o, will be very vi&s;ible to every one who &s;hall
ob&s;erve what pa&s;&s;eth round about him.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to inculcate, that the Dif|ference
between Prejudices and other Opinions doth
not con&s;i&s;t in this; that the former are fal&s;e, and
the latter true; but in this, that the former are taken
upon Tru&s;t, and the latter acquired by Rea&s;oning.
He, who hath been taught to believe the Immor|tality
of the Soul, may be as right in his Notion,
as he who hath rea&s;oned him&s;elf into that Opinion.
It will then by no means follow, that becau&s;e this
or that Notion is a Prejudice, it mu&s;t be therefore
fal&s;e. The not di&s;tingui&s;hing between Prejudices
and Errors, is a prevailing Over&s;ight among our
modern Free-thinkers.</P>
<P>There may be, indeed, certain mere Prejudices
or Opinions, which having no Rea&s;ons either a&s;|&s;igned
or a&s;&s;ignable, to &s;upport them, are neverthe&s;s
entertained by the Mind, becau&s;e they intruded be|times
into it. Such may be &s;uppo&s;ed fal&s;e, not be|cau&s;e
they were early learned, or learned without
their Rea&s;ons; but becau&s;e there are in truth no
Rea&s;ons to be given for them.</P>
<P>Certainly, if a Notion may be concluded fal&s;e,
becau&s;e it was early imbibed, or becau&s;e it is with
mo&s;t Men an Object of Belief rather than of
Knowledge, one may by the &s;ame Rea&s;oning con|clude
&s;everal Propo&s;itions of <HI>Euclid</HI> to be fal&s;e. A
&s;imple Apprehen&s;ion of Conclu&s;ions as taken in
<PB N="62" REF="59">
them&s;elves without the Deductions of Science, is
what falls to the Share of Mankind in general.
Religious Awe, the Precepts of Parents and
Ma&s;ters, the Wi&s;dom of Legi&s;lators, and the ac|cumulated
Experience of Ages, &s;upply the Place
of Proofs and Rea&s;onings with the Vulgar of all
Ranks: I would &s;ay, that Di&s;cipline, national Con|&s;titution,
and Laws human or divine, are &s;o many
plain Land Marks, which guide them into the
Paths wherein it is pre&s;umed they ought to tread.</P>
<P>From what hath been premi&s;ed, it plainly ap|pears
that in the Bulk of Mankind, there are, and
mu&s;t be Prejudices; that is, Opinions taken upon
Tru&s;t; or, in other Words, that there are Points
of Faith among all Men what&s;oever, as well as
among Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>And, as it is evident, that the unthinking Part
of every Age, Sex, and Condition among us, mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily receive Notions with the Submi&s;&s;ion of
Faith; &s;o it is very rea&s;onable, that they &s;hould
&s;ubmit their Faith to the greate&s;t Authorities human
and divine, the Law and the Go&s;pel. But, if once
all Reverence for the&s;e be de&s;troyed, our Pretenders
to moral Knowledge will have no Authority to
imbue the Multitude with &s;uch Notions as may
control their Appetites. From all which it follows,
that the modern Schemes of our Free-thinkers, who
pretend to &s;eparate Morality from Religion, how
rational &s;oever they may &s;eem to their Admirers,
are, in Truth and Effect, mo&s;t irrational and per|nicious
to civil Society.</P>
<P>Let any one, who thinks at all, con&s;ider the &s;avage
State of undi&s;ciplined Men, who&s;e Minds are
nurtured to no Doctrine, broke by no In&s;truction,
governed by no Principle. Let him at the &s;ame
Time reflect on a Society of Per&s;ons educated in
the Principles of our Church, formed betimes to
<PB N="63" REF="60">
fear God, to reverence their Superiors, to be grate|ful
to their Benefactors, forgiving to their Ene|mies,
ju&s;t and charitable to all Men; and he will
then be able to judge of the Merits of tho&s;e who
are &s;o active to weed out the Prejudices of Edu|cation.</P>
<P>Among the many wild Notions broached in the&s;e
giddy Times, it mu&s;t be owned, that &s;ome of our
Declaimers again&s;t Prejudice have wrought them|&s;elves
into a Sort of E&s;teem for Savages, as a vir|tuous
and unprejudiced People. In Proof of which,
they alledge their being free from many Vices
practi&s;ed in civilized Nations. Now, it is very
true, among Savages there are few In&s;tances to be
found of Luxury, Avarice, or Ambition; not that
the contrary Virtues take place, but becau&s;e the
Opportunities and Faculties for &s;uch Vices, are want|ing.
For the &s;ame Rea&s;on you do not &s;ee them in
Brutes.</P>
<P>What they e&s;teem and admire in tho&s;e Creatures,
is not Innocence, but Ignorance; it is not Virtue,
but Nece&s;&s;ity. Give them but the Means of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing,
and they know no Bounds. For Example:
Supply the Water-drinking Savage with &s;trong
Liquor, and he &s;hall be drunk for &s;everal Days and
Nights together. Again; we admit an unedu|cated
Savage knows not how to &s;upplant a Rival
with the refined Treachery of a Courtier; yet, if
you put his Foe once in his Power, you &s;hall &s;oon
&s;ee what a horrible Reli&s;h and Delight the Mon&s;ter
hath in Cruelty.</P>
<P>Above all others, religious Notions, or if you
will, Prejudices, (&s;ince this, as hath been already
ob&s;erved, detracts nothing from their Truth and
U&s;efulne&s;s) have the mo&s;t Influence, they are the
&s;tronge&s;t Curb from Vice, and the mo&s;t effectual
<PB N="64" REF="61">
Spur to worthy Conduct. And indeed, whether
we con&s;ider the Rea&s;on of Things, or the Practice
of Men in all Times, we &s;hall be &s;atisfied, that
nothing truly great and good can enter into the
Heart of one attached to no Principles of Religion,
who believes no Providence, who neither fears Hell,
nor hopes for Heaven.</P>
<P>Puni&s;hments and Rewards have always had, and
always will have the greate&s;t Weight with Men;
and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of both Kinds are pro|po&s;ed
by Religion, the Duties whereof fall in with
the Views of the civil Magi&s;trate; it undeniably
follows, that nothing can add more Strength to
a good and righteous Government than Religion.
Therefore it mainly concerns Governors to keep an
attentive Eye on the Religion of their Subjects.
And indeed, it is one Le&s;&s;on to Magi&s;trate and
People, Prince and Subject, <HI>Keep my Command|ments
and live, and my Law as the Apple of thine
Eye.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PROV. Ch. vii. Ver. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>Although it is no Con&s;equence from what hath
been &s;aid, that Men &s;hould be debarred the free
U&s;e of Rea&s;on and Inquiry; yet, &s;urely it will
follow, that without good Rea&s;on, a Man &s;hould
not reject tho&s;e Notions which have been in&s;tilled
by the Laws and Education of his Country. And
even they who think they have &s;uch Rea&s;on, have
neverthele&s;s no Right of dictating<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Though a Man's private Judgment be a Rule to him&s;elf, it will not thence follow, that he hath any Right to &s;et up for a Rule to others.</NOTE> to others. It
is true, divine Authority is &s;uperior to all human
Prejudices, In&s;titutions and Regards what&s;oever.
And it is wi&s;e, although at the Risk of Liberty,
or Life, to obey God rather than Man. But our
<PB N="65" REF="62">
modern Reformers of Prejudice, have nothing to
plead<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">No Man can &s;ay he is obliged in Con&s;cience, Honour, or Prudence, to in&s;ult the public Wi&s;dom, or to ridicule the Laws under who&s;e Protection he lives.</NOTE> of that kind.</P>
<P>There is no Magi&s;trate &s;o ignorant as not to
know that Power, phy&s;ical Power, re&s;ides in the
People; but Authority is from Opinion, which
Authority is nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train and direct the
People's Power, and therefore Religion is the great
Stay and Support of a State. Every Religion that
inculcates Virtue, and di&s;courageth Vice, is &s;o far
of public Benefit. The Chri&s;tian Religion doth
noth only this, but further makes every legal Con|&s;titution
&s;acred by commanding our Submi&s;&s;ion
thereto. <HI>Let every Soul be &s;ubject to the higher
Powers,</HI> &s;aith St. PAUL, <HI>for the Powers that be, are
ordained of God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ROM. Ch. xiii. Ver. 1.</NOTE>. And, in effect, for &s;everal Years
pa&s;t, while the Reverence for our Church and Re|ligion
hath been decaying and wearing off from
the Minds of Men, it may be ob&s;erved, that Loy|alty
hath in Proportion lo&s;t ground; and now the
very Word &s;eems quite forgotten. Submi&s;&s;ion
for Con&s;cience, as well as for Wrath, was once
reckoned an u&s;eful Le&s;&s;on; but now, with other
good Le&s;&s;ons, is laid a&s;ide as an ob&s;olete Preju|dice.</P>
<P>That Prince or Magi&s;trate, however great or
powerful, who thinks his own Authority &s;uffi|cient
to make him re&s;pected and obeyed, lies un|der
a woful Mi&s;take, and never fails to feel it &s;ooner
or later. Obedience to all civil Power is rooted in
the religious Fear of God; it is propagated, pre|&s;erved
and nouri&s;hed by Religion. This makes
Men obey, not with Eye-Service, but in Sincerity
of Heart. Human Regards may re&s;train Men
<PB N="66" REF="63">
from open and penal Offences; but the Fear of
God is a Re&s;traint from all Degrees of all Crimes,
however circum&s;tanced. Take away this Stay and
Prop of Duty, this Root of civil Authority; and
all that was &s;u&s;tained by it, or grew from it, &s;hall
&s;oon langui&s;h. The Authority, the very Being of
the Magi&s;trate, will prove a poor and precarious
Thing.</P>
<P>An inward Sen&s;e of the &s;upreme Maje&s;ty of the
King of Kings, is the only Thing that can beget
and pre&s;erve a true Re&s;pect for &s;ubordinate Maje|&s;ty
in all the Degrees of Power, the fir&s;t Link of
Authority being fixed at the Throne of God. But
in the&s;e our Days, that <HI>Maje&s;tas imperii,</HI> that Sa|credne&s;s
of Character, which rooted in a religious
Principle, was the great Guard and Security of
the State, is through Want thereof become the
public Scorn. And indeed, what Hold can the
Prince or Magi&s;trate have on the Con&s;cience of
tho&s;e who have no Con&s;cience? How can he build
on the Principles of &s;uch as have no Principles?
Or how can he hope for Re&s;pect where God him|&s;elf
is neglected?</P>
<P>It is manife&s;t that no Prince upon Earth can
hope to govern well, or even to live ea&s;y and &s;e|cure,
much le&s;s re&s;pected by his People, if he do
not contribute by his Example and Authority, to
keep up in their Minds an awful Sen&s;e of Religion.
As for a moral Sen&s;e and moral Fitne&s;s, or eter|nal
Relations, how in&s;ufficient tho&s;e Things are
for e&s;tabli&s;hing general and ju&s;t Notions of Mora|lity,

which People are taught whether they will or

Truth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> ALCIPHRON, Dial. I. Sect. 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>I &s;hall now add, that it is to be apprehended,
many of tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t forward to bani&s;h
Prejudices, would be the fir&s;t to feel the Want of
them. It is even pitiful to think what would be
come of certain moderate Declaimers on that Arti|cle,
were Prejudice really &s;et a&s;ide, and were all Men
to be weighed in the exact Scale of Merit, and con|&s;idered
in Proportion only to their intrin&s;ic Worth.
Some Prejudices are grounded in Truth, Rea&s;on and
Nature. Such are the Re&s;pects which are paid to
Knowledge, Learning, Age, Hone&s;ty and Cou|rage,
in all civilized Countries. Others are purely
<PB N="70" REF="67">

betimes.</P>
<P>GOD, comprehending within him&s;elf the Be|ginning,
End and Middle of all Things and Times,
exerts his Energy throughout the whole Creation.
He never cea&s;eth to influence by In&s;tinct, by the
Light of Nature, by his declared Will. And it
is the duty of Magi&s;trates and Lawgivers, to culti|vate
and encourage tho&s;e divine Impre&s;&s;ions in the
Minds of all Men under their Care. We are not
to think, it is the Work of God, and therefore not
to be &s;econded by human Care. Far otherwi&s;e, for
that very rea&s;on it claims our utmo&s;t Care and Di|ligence,
it being the indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty of all good
Men, throughout the whole Cour&s;e of their Lives,
to co-operate with the De&s;igns of Providence. In
Religion, as in Nature, God doth &s;omewhat, and
&s;omewhat is to be done on the Part of Man. He
cau&s;es the Earth to bring forth Materials for Food

tremble and fear before GOD.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DAN. Ch. VI. Ver. 26.</NOTE><HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>
likewi&s;e, another Heathen, made a Decree, that

any Thing ami&s;s again&s;t GOD, &s;hould be cut in
Pieces, and their Hou&s;es made a Dunghill.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">DAN. Ch. III. Ver. 29.</NOTE> And
if the&s;e Things were done in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Babylon,</HI>
&s;urely it may be expected, that impious Bla&s;phemers
again&s;t GOD and his Wor&s;hip, &s;hould, at lea&s;t, be
di&s;couraged and put out of Countenance in the&s;e
Chri&s;tian Countries. Now, a con&s;tant Cour&s;e of
Disfavour from Men in Authority, would prove a
mo&s;t effectual Check to all &s;uch Mi&s;creants. When
therefore they are public and bold in their Bla&s;phemies,
this is no &s;mall Reflexion on tho&s;e who
might check them if they would.</P>
<P>It is not &s;o much the Execution of the Laws, as
the Countenance of tho&s;e in Authority, that is
wanting to the Maintenance of Religion. If Men
of Rank and Power, who have a Share in di&s;|tributing
Ju&s;tice, and a Voice in the public Councils,
&s;hall be ob&s;erved to neglect divine Wor&s;hip them|&s;elves,
it mu&s;t needs be a great Temptation for
others to do the &s;ame. But if they, and their Fa|milies,
&s;hould &s;et a good Example, it may be pre|&s;umed
that Men of le&s;s Figure would be di&s;po&s;ed
to follow it. Fa&s;hions are always ob&s;erved to de|&s;cend,
and People are generally fond of being in
the Fa&s;hion: Whence one would be apt to &s;u&s;pect,
the prevailing Contempt of GOD'S Word, and E&s;trangement
from his Hou&s;e, to a Degree that
<PB N="84" REF="81">
was never known in any Chri&s;tian Country, mu&s;t
take its Ri&s;e from the Irreligion and bad Example
of tho&s;e who are &s;tiled <HI>the better Sort.</HI></P>
<P>Offences mu&s;t come, but Woe be to him, by
whom the Offence cometh. A Man who is in|tru&s;ted
with Power and Influence in his Country,
hath much to an&s;wer for, if Religion and Virtue
&s;uffer through Want of his Authority and Coun|tenance.
But in Ca&s;e he &s;hould, by the Vanity
of his Di&s;cour&s;e, his Favour to wicked Men, or
his own apparent Neglect of all religious Duties,
countenance what he ought to condemn, and au|thorize
by his own Example what he ought to puni&s;h;
&s;uch a one, whatever he may pretend, is in Fact
a bad Patriot, a bad Citizen, and a bad Subject, as
well as a bad Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Our Pro&s;pect is very terrible, and the Symptoms
grow &s;tronger every Day. The Morals of a People
are in this, like their Fortunes; when they feel a
national Shock, the wor&s;t doth not &s;hew it&s;elf
immediately. Things make a Shift to &s;ub&s;i&s;t for
a Time, on the Credit of old Notions and dying
Opinions. But the Youth born and brought up
in wicked Times, without any Bias to Good from
early Principle or in&s;tilled Opinion, when they
grow ripe mu&s;t be Mon&s;ters indeed. And it is to
be feared, that Age of Mon&s;ters is not far off.</P>
<P>Whence this Impiety-&s;prings, by what means it
gains ground among us, and how it may be
remedied, are Matters that de&s;erve the Attention
of all tho&s;e who have the Power and the Will to
&s;erve their Country. And although many Things
look like a Prelude to &s;ome general Ruin; although
it is much to be apprehended, we &s;hall be wor&s;e
before we are better; yet who knows what may
en&s;ue, if all Per&s;ons in Power, from the &s;upreme
Executor of the Law, down to a petty Con&s;table,
<PB N="85" REF="82">
would, in their &s;everal Stations, behave them&s;elves
like Men, truly con&s;cious and mindful, that the
Authority they are clothed with, is but a derivative
Ray from the &s;upreme Authority of Heaven?
This may not a little contribute to &s;tem that Tor|rent,
which from &s;mall Beginnings, and under
&s;pecious Pretences, hath grown to &s;uch a Head, and
daily gathers Force more and more to that Degree,
as threatens a general Inundation and De&s;truction
of the&s;e Realms.</P>

Word to the Wi&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>BE not &s;tartled, <HI>Reverend Sirs,</HI> to find your&s;elves
addre&s;&s;ed to by one of a different Communion.
We are indeed (to our Shame be it &s;poken) more
inclined to hate for tho&s;e Articles wherein we differ,
than to love one another for tho&s;e wherein we agree.
But if we cannot extingui&s;h, let us at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pend
our Animo&s;ities, and forgetting our religious Feuds,
con&s;ider our&s;elves in the amiable Light of Country|men
and Neighbours. Let us for once turn our
Eyes on tho&s;e Things, in which we have one com|mon
Intere&s;t. Why &s;hould Di&s;putes about Faith
interrupt the Duties of civil Life? or the different
Roads we take to Heaven prevent our taking the
&s;ame Steps on Earth? Do we not inhabit the &s;ame
Spot of Ground, breathe the &s;ame Air, and live
under the &s;ame Government? why then &s;hould we
not con&s;pire in one and the &s;ame De&s;ign, to pro|mote
the common Good of our Country?</P>
<P>We are all agreed about the U&s;efulne&s;s of Meat,
Drink, and Clothes, and without Doubt, we all
&s;incerely wi&s;h our poor Neighbours were better
&s;upplied with them. Providence and Nature have
<PB N="90" REF="85">
done their Part: no Country is better qualified to
furni&s;h the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, and yet no People
are wor&s;e provided. In vain is the Earth fertile,
and the Climate benign, if human Labour be
wanting. Nature &s;upplies the Materials, which
Art and Indu&s;try improve to the U&s;e of Man, and
it is the Want of this Indu&s;try that occa&s;ions all our
other Wants.</P>
<P>The Public hath endeavoured to excite and
encourage this u&s;eful Virtue. Much hath been
done; but whether it be from the Heavine&s;s of
the Climate, or from the <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Scythian</HI> Blood
that runs in their Veins, or whatever el&s;e may be
the Cau&s;e, there &s;till remains in the Natives of
this I&s;land a remarkable Antipathy to Labour. You,
<HI>Gentlemen,</HI> can alone conquer their innate hereditary
Sloth. Do you then, as you love your Country,
exert your&s;elves.</P>
<P>You are known to have great Influence on the
Minds of your People, be &s;o good as to u&s;e this
Influence for their Benefit. Since other Methods
fail, try what <HI>you</HI> can do. <HI>Be in&s;tant in Sea&s;on, out
of Sea&s;on, reprove, rebuke, exhort.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ch. iv. ver. 2.</NOTE> Make them
thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the Sin and Folly of Sloth.
Shew your Charity in clothing the naked and feed|ing
the hungry, which you may do by the mere
Breath of your Mouths. Give me leave to tell
you, that no Set of Men upon Earth have it in
their Power to do Good on ea&s;ier Terms, with
more Advantage to others, and le&s;s Pains or Lo&s;s
to them&s;elves. Your Flocks are of all others,
mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to follow Directions, and of all others
want them mo&s;t; and indeed what do they not want?</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of an <HI>Iri&s;h Pea&s;ant</HI> is the Cave of
Poverty; within, you &s;ee a Pot and a little Straw;

Dunghill. Their Fields and Gardens are a lively
Counterpart of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s De&s;cription in the Pro|verbs;
<HI>I went,</HI> &s;aith that wi&s;e King, <HI>by the Field
of the &s;lothful, and by the Vineyard of the Man void
of Under&s;tanding, and lo! it was all grown over with
Thorns, and Nettles had covered the Face thereof, and
the Stone Wall thereof was broken down</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. ch. xxiv. ver. 30, 31.</NOTE>. In every
Road the ragged En&s;igns of Poverty are di&s;played;
you often meet Caravans of Poor, whole Families
in a Drove, without Clothes to cover, or Bread to
feed them, both which might be ea&s;ily procured by
moderate Labour. They are encouraged in this
vagabond Life by the mi&s;erable Ho&s;pitality they
meet with in every Cottage, who&s;e Inhabitants
expect the &s;ame kind Reception in their Turn,
when they become Beggars them&s;elves; Beggary
being the la&s;t Refuge of the&s;e improvident Crea|tures.</P>
<P>If I &s;eem to go out of my Province, or to pre|&s;cribe
to tho&s;e who mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to know their
own Bu&s;ine&s;s, or to paint the lower Inhabitants of
this Land in no very plea&s;ing Colours, you will
candidly forgive a well meant Zeal, which obligeth
me to &s;ay Things, rather u&s;eful than agreeable, and
to lay open the Sore in order to heal it.</P>
<P>But whatever is &s;aid mu&s;t be &s;o taken, as not to
reflect on Per&s;ons of Rank and Education, who
are no way inferior to their Neighbours; nor yet
to include all even of the lowe&s;t Sort, though it
may well extend to the Generality, of tho&s;e e&s;pecially
in the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and <HI>Southern</HI> Parts of the Kingdom,

<P>Having long ob&s;erved and bewailed this wretched
State of my Countrymen, and the In&s;ufficiency of
&s;everal Methods &s;et on foot to reclaim them, I have
recour&s;e to <HI>your Reverences,</HI> as the <HI>dernier Re&s;ort.</HI>
Make them to under&s;tand that you have their In|tere&s;t
at heart, that you per&s;uade them to work for
their own Sakes, and that GOD hath ordered Mat|ters
&s;o as that, they who will not work for them|&s;elves,
mu&s;t work for others. The Terrors of
Debt, Slavery, and Famine &s;hould, one would
think, drive the mo&s;t &s;lothful to Labour. Make
them &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e Things, and that the Ends
of Providence and Order of the World require
Indu&s;try in human Creatures. <HI>Man goeth forth to

<P>All Nature will furni&s;h you with Arguments
and Examples again&s;t Sloth, <HI>Go to the Ant thou
Sluggard,</HI> cries <HI>Solomon.</HI> The Ant, the Bee, the
Beetle, and every In&s;ect but the Drone, reads a

Man will not work neither &s;hould he eat</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;&s;. ch. iii. ver. 10.</NOTE>. This
Command was injoined the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> and equal|ly
re&s;pects all <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and indeed all <HI>Mankind;</HI> it
being evident by the Light of Nature, that the
whole Creation works together for Good, and that
no Part was de&s;igned to be u&s;ele&s;s.; as therefore the
<HI>Idle Man</HI> is of no u&s;e, it follows, that he hath no
Right to a Sub&s;i&s;tence. <HI>Let them work,</HI> &s;aith the
<HI>Apo&s;tle, and eat their own Bread</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;&s;. ch. iii. ver. 12.</NOTE>; not Bread got

thee</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxxxviii. ver. 2.</NOTE>; intimating, that to work and enjoy the
Fruits thereof is a great Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>A &s;lothful Man's Imagination is apt to dre&s;s up
Labour in a horrible Mask; but horrible as it is,
Idlene&s;s is more to be dreaded, and a Life of
<PB N="94" REF="89">
Poverty (its nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence) is far more
painful. It was the Advice of <HI>Pythagoras, To choo&s;e
the be&s;t kind of Life,</HI> for that U&s;e would render it
agreeable, reconciling Men even to the roughe&s;t
Exerci&s;e. By Practice, Pains become at fir&s;t ea&s;y,
and in the Progre&s;s plea&s;ant; and this is &s;o true,
that whoever examines Things will find, there can
be no &s;uch Thing as a happy Life without Labour,
and that whoever doth not labour with his Hands,
mu&s;t in his own Defence labour with his Brains.</P>
<P>Certainly, planting and tilling the Earth is an
Exerci&s;e not le&s;s plea&s;ing than u&s;eful; it takes the
Pea&s;ant from his &s;moky Cabin, into the fre&s;h Air
and the open Field, rendering his Lot far more de|&s;irable
than that of the Sluggard, who lies in the
Straw, or &s;its whole Days by the Fire.</P>
<P>Convince your People that not only Plea&s;ure in|vites,
but Nece&s;&s;ity al&s;o drives them to labour. If
you have any Compa&s;&s;ion for the&s;e poor Creatures,
put them in mind how many of them peri&s;hed in
a late memorable Di&s;tre&s;s, through want of that
provident Care again&s;t a hard Sea&s;on, ob&s;ervable
not only in all other Men, but even in irrational
Animals. Set before their Eyes in lively Colours,
their own indigent and &s;ordid Lives, compared
with tho&s;e of other People, who&s;e Indu&s;try hath
procured them hearty Food, warm Clothes, and
decent Dwellings. Make them &s;en&s;ible what a Re|proach
it is, that a Nation which makes &s;o great
Preten&s;ions to Antiquity, and is &s;aid to have
flouri&s;hed many Ages ago in Arts and Learning,
&s;hould in the&s;e our Days turn out a lazy, de&s;titute,
and degenerate Race.</P>
<P>Rai&s;e your Voices, <HI>Reverend Sirs,</HI> exert your
Influence, &s;hew your Authority over the Multitude,
by engaging them to the Practice of an hone&s;t
Indu&s;try, a Duty nece&s;&s;ary to all, and required in all,
<PB N="95" REF="90">
whether <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> or <HI>Roman Catholics,</HI> whether
<HI>Chri&s;tians, Jews,</HI> or <HI>Pagans.</HI> Be &s;o good among
other Points to find room for <HI>This,</HI> than which none
is of more Concern to the Souls and Bodies of your
Hearers, nor con&s;equently de&s;erves to be more
amply, or frequently in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>Many and obvious are the Motives that recom|mend
this Duty. Upon a Subject &s;o copious, you
can never be at a lo&s;s for &s;omething to &s;ay. And
while by the&s;e Means you re&s;cue your Countrymen
from Want and Mi&s;ery, you will have the Sati&s;|faction
to behold your Country it&s;elf improved.
What Plea&s;ure mu&s;t it give you to &s;ee the&s;e wa&s;te
and wild Scenes, the&s;e naked Ditches, and mi&s;erable
Hovels, exchanged for fine Plantations, rich
Meadows, well-tilled Fields, and neat Dwellings;
to &s;ee People well fed, and well clad, in&s;tead of
fami&s;hed, ragged Scarecrows; and tho&s;e very Per|&s;ons
tilling the Fields that u&s;ed to beg in the Streets.</P>
<P>Neither ought the Difficulty of the Enterpri&s;e
to frighten you from attempting it. It mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed a Habit of Indu&s;try is not at once intro|duced;
Neighbour, neverthele&s;s, will emulate
Neighbour, and the Contagion of good Example
will &s;pread as &s;urely as of bad, though perhaps not
&s;o &s;peedily. It may be hoped, there are many that
would be allured by a plentiful and decent Manner
of Life to take Pains, e&s;pecially when they ob&s;erve
it to be attained by the Indu&s;try of their Neigh|bours,
in no Sort better qualified than them&s;elves.</P>
<P>If the &s;ame gentle Spirit of Sloth did not &s;ooth
our Squires as well as Pea&s;ants, one would imagine
there &s;hould be no idle Hands among us. Alas!
how many Incentives to Indu&s;try offer them&s;elves
in this I&s;land, crying aloud to the Inhabitants for
Work? Roads to be repaired, Rivers made navi|gable,
Fi&s;heries on the Coa&s;ts, Mines to be wrought,
<PB N="96" REF="91">
Plantations to be rai&s;ed, Manufactures improved,
and, above all, Lands to be tilled and &s;owed with
all Sorts of Grain.</P>
<P>When &s;o many Circum&s;tances provoke and ani|mate
your People to Labour, when their private
Wants, and the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Public, when the
Laws, the Magi&s;trates, and the very Country calls
upon them, you cannot think it becomes you alone
to be &s;ilent, or hindmo&s;t in every Project for pro|moting
the public Good. Why &s;hould you, who&s;e
Influence is greate&s;t, be lea&s;t active? why &s;hould
you, who&s;e Words are mo&s;t likely to prevail, &s;ay
lea&s;t in the common Cau&s;e?</P>
<P>Perhaps it will be &s;aid the Di&s;couragements at|tending
tho&s;e of your Communion are a Bar again&s;t
all Endeavours for exciting them to a laudable In|du&s;try.
Men are &s;tirred up to labour by the Pro|&s;pect
of bettering their Fortunes, by getting E&s;tates,
or Employments; but tho&s;e who are limited in the
Purcha&s;e of E&s;tates, and excluded from all civil Em|ployments,
are deprived of tho&s;e Spurs to Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>To this it may be an&s;wered, that admitting the&s;e
Con&s;iderations do, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, damp In|du&s;try
and Ambition in Per&s;ons of a certain Rank,
yet they can be no Let to the Indu&s;try of poor
People, or &s;upply an Argument again&s;t endeavouring
to procure Meat, Drink, and Clothes. It is not
propo&s;ed, that you &s;ould per&s;uade the better Sort
to acquire E&s;tates, or qualify them&s;elves for becom|ing
Magi&s;trates; but only that you &s;hould &s;et the
lowe&s;t of the People at Work, to provide them|&s;elves
with Nece&s;&s;aries, and &s;upply the Wants of
Nature.</P>
<P>It will be alledged in Excu&s;e of their Idlene&s;s,
that the Country People want Encouragement to
labour, as not having a Property in the Lands.
There is &s;mall Encouragement, &s;ay you, for them
<PB N="97" REF="92">
to build, or plant upon another's Land, wherein
they have only a temporary Intere&s;t. To which I
an&s;wer, that Life it&s;elf is but temporary; that all
Tenures are not of the &s;ame Kind; that the Ca&s;e
of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the original <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> is equal in this
Re&s;pect; and that the true <HI>Aborigines,</HI> or natural
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> are noted for Want of Indu&s;try in improving
even on their own Lands, whereof they have both
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Property.</P>
<P>How many indu&s;trious Per&s;ons are there in all
civilized Countries, without any Property in Lands,
or any Pro&s;pect of E&s;tates, or Employments?
Indu&s;try never fails to reward her Votaries. There
is no one but can earn a little, and little added to
little makes a Heap. In this fertile and plentiful
I&s;land, none can peri&s;h for Want but the Idle
and Improvident. None who have Indu&s;try, Fru|gality,
and Fore&s;ight, but may get into tolerable,
if not wealthy Circum&s;tances. Are not all Trades
and Manufactures open to tho&s;e of your Commu|nion?
have you not the &s;ame free U&s;e, and may
you not make the &s;ame Advantage of Fairs and
Markets as other Men? do you pay higher Duties,
or are you liable to greater Impo&s;itions than your
fellow Subjects? and are not the public Praemiums
and Encouragements given indifferently to Arti&s;ts
of all Communions? have not, in Fact, tho&s;e of
your Communion a very great Share of the Com|merce
of this Kingdom in their Hands? and is not
more to be got by this than by purcha&s;ing E&s;tates,
or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing civil Employments, who&s;e Incomes are
often attended with large Expences?</P>
<P>A tight Hou&s;e, warm Apparel, and whol&s;om
Food are &s;ufficient Motives to labour. If all had
them, we &s;hould be a flouri&s;hing Nation. And if
tho&s;e who take pains may have them, tho&s;e who
will not take pains are not to be pitied; they are to
<PB N="98" REF="93">
be looked on and treated as Drones, the Pe&s;t and
Di&s;grace of Society.</P>
<P>It will be &s;aid, the Hardne&s;s of the Landlord
cramps the Indu&s;try of the Tenant. But if Rent
be high, and the Landlord rigorous, there is more
need of Indu&s;try in the Tenant. It is well known
that in <HI>Holland</HI> Taxes are much higher, and Rent
both of Land and Hou&s;es far dearer than in <HI>Ireland.</HI>
But this is no Objection or Impediment to the Indu&s;|try
of the People, who are rather animated and &s;pur|red
on to earn a Livelihood by Labour, that is not
to be got without it.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay, it is an ea&s;y Matter to make a
plau&s;ible Di&s;courle on Indu&s;try, and its Advantages;
but what can be expected from poor Creatures, who
are de&s;titute of all Conveniencies for exerting their
Indu&s;try, who have nothing to improve upon, no|thing
to begin the World with? I an&s;wer, they
have their four Quarters, and five Sen&s;es. Is it no|thing
to po&s;&s;e&s;s the bodily Organs found and entire!
That wonderful Machine the Hand, was it formed
to be idle?</P>
<P>Was there but Will to work, there are not want|ing
in this I&s;land either Opportunities or Encourage|ments.
Spinning alone might employ all idle
Hands (Children as well as Parents) being &s;oon
learned, ea&s;ily performed, and never failing of a
Market, requiring neither Wit nor Strength, but
&s;uited to all Ages and Capacities. The Public
provides Uten&s;ils, and Per&s;ons for teaching the U&s;e
of them; but the Public cannot provide a Heart
and Will to be indu&s;trious. The&s;e, I will not deny,
may be found in &s;everal Per&s;ons in &s;ome other Parts
of the Kingdom, and where-ever they are found,
the comfortable Effects &s;hew them&s;elves. But
&s;eldom, very &s;eldom are they found in the&s;e
<HI>Southern</HI> Peeple, who&s;e Indolence figureth a Lion
<PB N="99" REF="94">
in the Way, and is Proof again&s;t all Encouarge|ment.</P>
<P>But you will in&s;i&s;t, how can a poor Man, who&s;e
daily Labour goes for the Payment of his Rent, be
able to provide pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;aries for his Fa|mily,
much le&s;s to lay up a Store for the future.
It mu&s;t be owned, a con&s;iderable Share of the poor
Man's Time and Labour goes towards paying his
Rent. But how are his Wife and Children employ|ed,
or how doth he employ him&s;elf the re&s;t of his
Time? The &s;ame Work tires, but different Works
relieve. Where there is a true Spirit of Indu&s;try,
there will never be wanting &s;omething to do, with|out
Doors, or within, by Candle-light, if not by
Day-light. <HI>Labor ip&s;e Voluptas,</HI> &s;aith the Poet, and
this is verified in Fact.</P>
<P>In <HI>England,</HI> when the Labour of the Field is over,
it is u&s;ual for Men to betake them&s;elves to &s;ome
other Labour of a different kind. In the <HI>Northern</HI>
Parts of that indu&s;trious Land, the Inhabitants
meet, a jolly Crew, at one another's Hou&s;es, where
they merrily and frugally pa&s;s the long and dark
Winter Evenings; &s;everal Families by the &s;ame
Light, and the &s;ame Fire, working at their differ|ent
Manufactures of Wooll, Flax, or Hemp, Com|pany
mean while mutually cheering and provoking
to labour. In certain other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">e. g. <HI>Newport-Pagnel</HI> in <HI>Buckingham&s;hire.</HI></NOTE> Parts you may &s;ee,
on a Summer's Evening, the common Labourers
&s;itting along the Street of a Town or Village,
each at his own Door, with a Cu&s;hion before him
making Bone-lace, and earning more in an Even|ing's
Pa&s;time than an <HI>Iri&s;h Family</HI> would in a whole
Day. Tho&s;e People in&s;tead of clo&s;ing the Day
with a Game on grea&s;y Cards, or lying &s;tretched be|fore
the Fire, pa&s;s their Time much more chear|fully
<PB N="100" REF="95">
in &s;ome u&s;eful Employment, which Cu&s;tom
hath rendered light and agreeable.</P>
<P>But admitting, for the various Rea&s;ons above
alledged, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for our Cottagers to
be rich, yet it is certain they may be clean. Now
bring them to be cleanly, and your Work is half
done. A little Wa&s;hing, &s;crubbing, and rubbing,
be&s;towed on their Per&s;ons and Hou&s;es, would intro|duce
a &s;ort of Indu&s;try, and Indu&s;try in any one
kind is apt to beget it in another.</P>
<P>Indolence in Dirt is a terrible Symptom, which
&s;hews it&s;elf in our lower <HI>lri&s;h</HI> more, perhaps, than
in any People on this Side <HI>The Cape of Good Hope.</HI>
I will venture to add, that look throughout the
Kingdom, and you &s;hall not find a clean Hou&s;e in|habited
by clean People, and yet wanting Nece&s;&s;a|ries;
the &s;ame Spirit of Indu&s;try that keeps Folk
clean, being &s;ufficient to keep them al&s;o in Food
and Raiment.</P>
<P>But alas! our poor <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> are wedded to Dirt up|on
Principle. It is with &s;ome them a Maxim, that
the Way to make Children thrive is to keep them
dirty. And I do verily believe, that the Familiari|ty
with Dirt, contracted and nouri&s;hed from their
Infancy, is one great Cau&s;e of that Sloth which
attends them in every Stage of Life. Were Chil|dren
but brought up in an Abhorrence of Dirt, and
obliged to keep them&s;elves clean, they would
have &s;omething to do, whereas now they do
nothing.</P>
<P>It is pa&s;t all doubt, that tho&s;e who are educated
in a &s;upine Neglect of all Things, either profitable
or decent, mu&s;t needs contract a Sleepine&s;s and In|dolence,
which doth nece&s;&s;arily lead to Poverty,
and every other Di&s;tre&s;s that attends it. <HI>Love not
Sleep,</HI> cries <HI>Solomon, le&s;t thou come to Poverty; open
<PB N="101" REF="96">
thine Eyes and thou &s;halt be &s;atisfied with Bread</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Prov. ch. xx. ver. 13.</NOTE>.
It is therefore greatly to be wi&s;hed, that you would
per&s;uade Parents, to inure their Children betimes to
a Habit of Indu&s;try, as the &s;ure&s;t Way to &s;hun the
Mi&s;eries that mu&s;t otherwi&s;e befal them.</P>
<P>An early Habit, whether of Sloth, or Diligence,
will not fail to &s;hew it&s;elf throughout the whole
Cour&s;e of a Man's Life. <HI>Train up a Child,</HI> &s;aith
the <HI>Wi&s;eman, in the Way he &s;hould go, and when he
is old he will not depart from it</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. ch. xxii. ver. 6.</NOTE>. The fir&s;t Tinc|ture
often leaves &s;o deep a Stain as no Afterthought
or Endeavour can wa&s;h out. Hence Sloth in &s;ome
Minds is Proof again&s;t all Arguments and Exam|ples
what&s;oever, all Motives of Intere&s;t and Duty,
all Impre&s;&s;ions even of Cold and Hunger. This
Habit rooted in the Child, grows up and adheres
to the Man, producing a general Li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s,
and Aver&s;ion from Labour. This I take to be our
great Calamity.</P>
<P>For admitting, that &s;ome of our Squires and
Landlords are Vultures with Iron Bowels, and that
their Hardne&s;s and Severity is a great Di&s;courage|ment
to the Tenant, who will naturally prefer Want
and Ea&s;e before Want and Toil; it mu&s;t at the &s;ame
time be admitted, that neither is the Landlord, ge|nerally
&s;peaking, &s;o hard, nor the Climate &s;o &s;evere,
nor the Soil &s;o ungrateful, as not to an&s;wer the
Husbandman's Labour, where there is a Spirit of
Indu&s;try; the Want of which is the true Cau&s;e of
our national Di&s;tre&s;s. Of this there are many evi|dent
Proofs.</P>
<P>I have my&s;elf known a Man, from the lowe&s;t
Condition of Life, without Friends or Education,
not knowing &s;o much as to write or read, bred to
no Trade or Calling, by pure Dint of Day-labour,
<PB N="102" REF="97">
Frugality, and Fore&s;ight, to have grown wealthy,
even in this I&s;land, and under all the abovementi|oned
Di&s;advantages. And what is done by one, is
po&s;&s;ible to another.</P>
<P>In <HI>Holland</HI> a Child five Years old is maintained
by its own Labour; In <HI>Ireland</HI> many Children of
twice that Age do nothing but &s;teal, or incumber
the Hearth and Dunghill. This &s;hameful Neglect
of Education &s;hews it&s;elf through the whole Cour&s;e
of their Lives, in a matchle&s;s Sloth bred in the ve|ry
Bone, and not to be accounted for by any out|ward
Hard&s;hip or Di&s;couragement whatever. It is
the native Colour, if we may &s;o &s;peak, and Com|plexion
of the People. <HI>Dutch, Engli&s;h, French,</HI> or
<HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> cannot match them.</P>
<P>Mark an <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI> at Work in the Field; if a
Coach, or Hor&s;eman go by, he is &s;ure to &s;u&s;pend
his Labour, and &s;tand &s;taring until they are out of
Sight. A Neighbour of mine made it his Remark
in a Journey from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> that all the
Labourers, of whom he enquired the Road, con|&s;tantly
an&s;wered without looking up, or interrupt|ing
their Work, except one who &s;tood &s;taring and
leaning on his Spade, and him he found to be an
<HI>Iri&s;hman.</HI></P>
<P>It is a &s;hameful Thing and peculiar to this Nati|on,
to &s;ee lu&s;ty Vagabonds &s;trolling about the Coun|try,
and begging without any Pretence to beg.
Ask them why they do not labour to earn their own
Livelihood, they will tell you. They want Em|ployment;
offer to employ them, and they &s;hall re|fu&s;e
your Offer; or, if you get them to work one
Day, you may be &s;ure not to &s;ee them the next. I
have known them tdecline even the lighre&s;t Labour,
that of Hay-making, having at the &s;ame time
neither Clothes for their Backs, nor Food for their
Bellies.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="98">
A &s;ore Leg is an E&s;tate to &s;uch a Fellow, and
this may be ea&s;ily got and continued with &s;mall
Trouble. Such is their Lazine&s;s, that rather than
work they will cheri&s;h a Di&s;temper. This I know
to be true, having &s;een more than one In&s;tance,
wherein the &s;econd Nature &s;o far prevailed over the
fir&s;t, that Sloth was preferred to Health. To the&s;e
Beggars who make much of their Sores, and pro|long
their Di&s;ea&s;es, you cannot do a more thankle&s;s
Office than cure them, except it be to &s;have their
Beards, which conciliate a &s;ort of Reverence to that
Order of Men.</P>
<P>It is indeed a difficult Task to reclaim &s;uch Fel|lows
from their &s;lothful and brutal Manner of Life,
to which they &s;eem wedded with an Attachment
that no temporal Motives can conquer; nor is there,
humanly &s;peaking, any Hopes they will mend, ex|cept
their Re&s;pect for your Le&s;&s;ons, and Fear of
&s;omething beyond the Grave be able to work a
Change in them.</P>
<P>Certainly, if I may advi&s;e, you &s;hould in Return
for the Lenity and Indulgence of the Government,
endeavour to make your&s;elves u&s;eful to the Public;
and this will be&s;t be performed by rou&s;ing your
poor Countrymen from their beloved Sloth. I
&s;hall not now di&s;pute the Truth, or Importance of
other Points, but will venture to &s;ay, that you may
&s;till find Time to inculcate this Doctrine of an
<HI>hone&s;t Indu&s;try,</HI> and that this would by no means be
Time thrown away, if promoting your Country's
Intere&s;t, and re&s;cuing &s;o many unhappy Wretches
of your Communion from Beggary, or the Gallows,
be thought worth your Pains.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem you cannot in your Sermons do
better than inveigh again&s;t Idlene&s;s, that exten&s;ive
Parent of many Mi&s;eries and many Sins; Idlene&s;s
the Mother of Hunger and Si&s;ter of Theft; <HI>Idle|ne&s;s
<PB N="104" REF="99">
which,</HI> the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>Sirach</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>teacheth
many Vices.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame Doctrine is often preached from the
Gallows. And indeed the Poverty, Nakedne&s;s,
and Famine which Idlene&s;s entaileth on her Vota|ries,
do make Men &s;o wretched, that they may
well think it better to die than to live &s;uch Lives.
Hence a Courage for all villanous Undertakings,
which bringing Men to a &s;hameful Death, do then
open their Eyes when they are going to be clo&s;ed
for ever.</P>
<P>If you have any Regard (as it is not to be doubt|ed)
either for the Souls, or Bodies of your People,
or even for your own Intere&s;t and Credit, you can|not
fail to inveigh again&s;t this crying Sin of your
Country. Seeing you are obnoxious to the Laws,
&s;hould you not in Prudence try to reconcile your|&s;elves
to the Favour of the Public; and can you do
this more effectually, than by co-operating with
the public Spirit of the Legi&s;lature, and Men in
Power?</P>
<P>Were this but done heartily, would you but <HI>be
in&s;tant in Sea&s;on, and out of Sea&s;on, reprove, rebuke,
exhort</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ch. iv. ver. 2.</NOTE>, &s;uch is the A&s;cendent you have gained over
the People, that we might &s;oon expect to &s;ee the
good Effects thereof. We might hope <HI>that our
Garners would be &s;oon full, affording all manner of
Store, that our Sheep would bring forth thou&s;ands,
that our Oxen would be &s;trong to labour, that there
would be no breaking in, nor going out,</HI> (no Robbery,
nor Migration nor Bread) <HI>and that there would be no
Complaining in our Streets.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxliv. ver. 13, 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>It &s;tands you upon to act with Vigour in this
Cau&s;e, and &s;hake off the Shackles of Sloth from
your Countrymen, the rather, becau&s;e there be
<PB N="105" REF="100">
&s;ome who &s;urmi&s;e, that your&s;elves have put them
on. Right, or wrong, Men will be apt to judge
of your Doctrines by their Fruits. It will reflect
&s;mall Honour on their Teachers, if in&s;tead of Ho|ne&s;ty
and Indu&s;try tho&s;e of your Communion are
peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the contrary Qualities,
or if the Nation converted by the great and glori|ous
<HI>Saint Patrick,</HI> &s;hould, above ail other Na|tions,
be &s;tigmati&s;ed and marked out as good for
nothing.</P>
<P>I can never &s;uppo&s;e you &s;o much your own Ene|mies,
as to be Friends to this odious Sloth. But
were this once aboli&s;hed, and a laudable Indu&s;try
introduced in its Stead, it may perhaps be asked,
who are to be Gainers? I an&s;wer, <HI>your Reverences</HI>
are like to be great Gainers; for every Peny you
now gain, you will gain a Shilling: you would
gain al&s;o in your Credit: and your Lives would be
more comfortable.</P>
<P>You need not be told, how hard it is to take
from Rags and Penury a tolerable Sub&s;i&s;tence; or
how offen&s;ive to perform the Duties of your Func|tion,
amid&s;t Stench and Na&s;tine&s;s; or how much
Things would change for the better, in Proportion
to the Indu&s;try and Wealth of your Flocks. Duty
as well as Intere&s;t calls upon you to clothe the
Naked, and feed the Hungry, by per&s;uading them
to <HI>eat</HI> (in the Apo&s;tle's Phra&s;e) <HI>their own Bread,</HI> or,
as the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> expre&s;&s;eth it, <HI>the Labour of their
own Hands.</HI> By in&s;piring your Flocks with a Love
of Indu&s;try, you will at once &s;trike at the Root of
many Vices, and di&s;po&s;e them to practi&s;e many
Virtues. This therefore is the readie&s;t Way to im|prove
them.</P>
<P>Con&s;ult your Superiors. They &s;hall tell you the
Doctrine here delivered is a &s;ound Catholic Doctrine,
not limited to <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> but extending to all, and
<PB N="106" REF="101">
admitted by all, whether <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> or <HI>Roman Ca|tholics,
Chri&s;tians</HI> or <HI>Mahometans, Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles.</HI>
And as it is of the greate&s;t Extent, &s;o it is al&s;o of
the highe&s;t Importance. <HI>Saint Paul</HI> expre&s;ly &s;aith,
<HI>That if any provide not for his own, and e&s;pecially for
tho&s;e of his own Hou&s;e, he hath denied the Faith, and
is wor&s;e than an Infidel</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ch. v. ver. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In vain then do you endeavour to make Men
Orthodox in Points of Faith, if at the &s;ame time
in the Eyes of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Apo&s;tles, you &s;uffer
them to be wor&s;e than Infidels, than tho&s;e who
have no Faith at all. There is &s;omething it &s;eems
wor&s;e than even Infidelity; and to incite and &s;ti|mulate
you to put away that cur&s;ed Thing from
among you, is the De&s;ign and Aim of this <HI>Addre&s;s.</HI>
The Doctrine we recommend is an evident Branch
of the Law of Nature; it was taught by Prophets,
inculcated by Apo&s;tles, encouraged and inforced
by Philo&s;ophers, Legi&s;lators, and all wi&s;e States,
in all Ages, and in all Parts of the World. Let
me therefore intreat you to exert your&s;elves, <HI>To be
In&s;tant in Sea&s;on, and out of Sea&s;on, rebuke, reprove,
exhort.</HI> Take all Opportunities to drive the Lion
out of the Way; rai&s;e your Voices, omit no
Occa&s;ion, public or private, of awakening your
wretched Countrymen from their &s;weet Dream of
Sloth.</P>
<P>Many &s;u&s;pect your Religion to be the Cau&s;e of
that notorious Idlene&s;s, which prevails &s;o generally
among the Natives of this I&s;land, as if the <HI>Roman
Catholic</HI> Faith was incon&s;i&s;tent with an hone&s;t
Diligence in a Man's Calling. But whoever con|&s;iders
the great Spirit of Indu&s;try that reigns in
<HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and even beyond the <HI>Alps,</HI> mu&s;t
acknowledge this to be a groundle&s;s Su&s;picion. In
<PB N="107" REF="102">
<HI>Piedmont</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> in the <HI>Milane&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Ve|netian
State,</HI> and indeed throughout all <HI>Lombardy,</HI>
how well is the Soil cultivated, and what Manu|factures
of Silk, Velvet, Paper, and other Com|modities
flouri&s;h? The King of <HI>Sardinia</HI> will &s;uffer
no idle Hands in his Territories, no Beggar to live
by the Sweat of another's Brow; it has even been
made penal at <HI>Turin,</HI> to relieve a &s;trolling Beggar.
To which I might add, that the Per&s;on who&s;e Au|thority
will be of the greate&s;t Weight with you,
even the <HI>Pope</HI> him&s;elf, is at this Day endeavouring
to put new Life into the Trade and Manufactures
of his Country.</P>
<P>Though I am in no Secret of the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI>
yet I will venture to affirm, that neither <HI>Pope,</HI>
nor <HI>Cardinals,</HI> will be plea&s;ed to hear, that tho&s;e of
their Communion are di&s;tingui&s;hed above all others,
by Sloth, Dirt, and Beggary; or be di&s;plea&s;ed at
your endeavouring to re&s;cue them from the Reproach
of &s;uch an infamous Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is as clear as the Sun; what we urge
is inforced by every Motive that can work on a
rea&s;onable Mind. The Good of your Country,
your own private Intere&s;t, the Duty of your Func|tion,
the Cries and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Poor do with
one Voice call for your A&s;&s;i&s;tance. And if it is
on all hands allowed to be right and ju&s;t, if agree|able
both to Rea&s;on and Religion, if coincident
with the Views both of your temporal and &s;piritual
Superiors, it is to be hoped, <HI>this Addre&s;s</HI> may find a
favourable Reception, and that a Zeal for di&s;puted
Points will not hinder your concurring to propagate
&s;o plain and u&s;eful a Doctrine, wherein we are all
agreed.</P>
<P>When a Leak is to be &s;topped, or a Fire extin|gui&s;hed,
do not all Hands co-operate without Di&s;|tinction
of Sect or Party? Or if I am fallen into a
<PB N="108" REF="103">
Ditch, &s;hall I not &s;uffer a Man to help me out,
until I have fir&s;t examined his Creed? Or when I
am &s;ick, &s;hall I refu&s;e the Phy&s;ic, becau&s;e my Phy|&s;ician

<P><HI>Fas e&s;t et ab Ho&s;te doceri.</HI> But in truth, I am no

<P>NOtwith&s;tanding the Differences of our religi|ous

my&s;elf &s;trongly inclined, at this critical Juncture,
to put you in mind, that you have been treat|ed
with a truly Chri&s;tian Lenity under the pre&s;ent

and your Properties &s;ecured by equal Laws,

among us at pre&s;ent, but as &s;oon as their own Ends
are &s;erved, will not fail to abandon you, as they
have always done.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="106">
Is it not evident that your true Intere&s;t con&s;i&s;ts in
lying &s;till, and waiting the Event, &s;ince <HI>Ireland</HI>
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow the Fate of <HI>England;</HI> and that
therefore Prudence and Policy pre&s;cribe Quiet to
the Roman Catholics of this Kingdom, who, in
ca&s;e a Change of Hands &s;hould not &s;ucceed, after
your attempting to bring it about, mu&s;t then expect
to be on a wor&s;e Foot than ever?</P>
<P>But we will &s;uppo&s;e it &s;ucceeds to your Wi&s;h.
What then? Would not this undermine even your
own Intere&s;ts and Fortune, which are often inter|woven
with tho&s;e of your Neighbours? Would
not all tho&s;e, who have Debts or Money, or other
Effects in the Hands of Prote&s;tants, be fellow Suf|ferers
with them? Would not all tho&s;e who hold
under the Acts of Settlement, be as liable as Prote&s;|tants
them&s;elves to be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the old Pro|prietors?
Or, can even tho&s;e who are &s;tiled Pro|prietors,
flatter them&s;elves with Hopes of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
the E&s;tates which they claim, which, in all likeli|hood,
would be given to Favourites, (perhaps to
Foreigners) who are near the Per&s;on, or who fought
the Battles, of their Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Under Prote&s;tant Governments, tho&s;e of your
Communion, have formerly enjoyed a greater Share
of the Lands of this Kingdom, and more ample
Privileges. You bore your Part in the Magi&s;tracy
and the Legi&s;lature, and could complain of no
Hard&s;hips on the Score of your Religion. If the&s;e
Advantages have been &s;ince impaired or lo&s;t, was
it not by the wrong Mea&s;ures your&s;elves took to
enlarge them, in &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Attempts, each
of which left you weaker and in a wor&s;e Condi|tion
than you were before. And this, notwith|&s;tanding
the vaunted Succours of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI>
who&s;e vain Efforts in Conjunction with yours con|&s;tantly
recoiled on your own Heads, even when
<PB N="112" REF="107">
your Numbers and Circum&s;tances were far more
con&s;iderable than they now are.</P>
<P>You all know the&s;e Things to be true. I appeal
to your own Brea&s;ts. Dear bought Experience
hath taught you, and pa&s;t Times in&s;truct the pre|&s;ent.
But perhaps you follow Con&s;cience rather
than Intere&s;t. Will any Men among&s;t you pretend
to plead Con&s;cience again&s;t being quiet, or again&s;t
paying Allegiance and peaceable Submi&s;&s;ion to a
Prote&s;tant Prince, which the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians paid
even to Heathen, and which tho&s;e of your Com|munion,
at this Day, pay to Mahometan and to Ido|latrous
Princes in <HI>Turky</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> and which you
your&s;elves have &s;o often profe&s;&s;ed to pay to our
pre&s;ent gracious Sovereign? Con&s;cience is quite
out of the Ca&s;e. And what Man in his Sen&s;es
would engage in a dangerous Cour&s;e, to which nei|ther
Intere&s;t doth invite, nor Con&s;cience oblige
him?</P>
<P>I heartily wi&s;h, that this Advice may be as well
taken, as it is meant, and that you may maturely
con&s;ider your true Intere&s;t, rather than ra&s;hly repeat
the &s;ame Errors which you have &s;o often repented
of. So recommending you to the merciful Guid|ance
of Almighty God, I &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>MAXIMS
CONCERNING
PATRIOTISM.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fir&s;t Publi&s;hed, A. D. MDCCL.</HEAD>
<P>1. EVERY Man, by con&s;ulting his own Heart,
may ea&s;ily know whether he is or is not a
Patriot. But it is not &s;o ea&s;y for the By&s;tanders.</P>
<P>2. Being loud and vehement either again&s;t a
Court, or for a Court, is no Proof of Patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>3. A Man who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion for Money runs high,
bids fair for being no Patriot. And he likewi&s;e
who&s;e Appetite is keen for Power.</P>
<P>4. A Native than a Foreigner, a married Man
than a Bachelor, a Believer than an Infidel, have
a better Chance for being Patriots.</P>
<P>5. It is impo&s;&s;ible an Epicure &s;hould be a Patriot.</P>
<P>6. It is impo&s;&s;ible a Man who cheats at Cards,
or cogs the Dice, &s;hould be a Patriot.</P>
<P>7. It is impo&s;&s;ible a Man who is fal&s;e to his
Friends and Neighbours &s;hould be true to the Public.</P>
<P>8. Every Knave is a thorough Knave. And a
thorough Knave is a Knave throughout.</P>
<P>9. A Man who hath no Sen&s;e of God or Con|&s;cience:
would you make &s;uch a one Guardian to
your Child? if not, why Guardian to the State?</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="109">
10. A Sot, a Bea&s;t, benummed and &s;tupified by
Exce&s;s, is good for nothing, much le&s;s to make a
Patriot of.</P>
<P>11. A Fop or Man of Plea&s;ure makes but a
&s;curvy Patriot.</P>
<P>12. A &s;ullen, churli&s;h Man, who loves no Body,
will hardly love his Country.</P>
<P>13. The Love of Prai&s;e and E&s;teem may do
&s;omething: but to make a true Patriot there mu&s;t
be an inward Sen&s;e of Duty and Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>14. Hone&s;ty (like other Things) grows from its
proper Seed, good Principles early laid in the
Mind.</P>
<P>15. To be a real Patriot, a Man mu&s;t con&s;ider
his Countrymen as God's Creatures, and him&s;elf as
accountable for his acting towards them.</P>
<P>16. If <HI>pro Aris et Focis</HI> be the Life of Patrioti&s;m,
he who hath no Religion or no Home makes a
&s;u&s;pected Patriot.</P>
<P>17. No Man perjures him&s;elf for the &s;ake of
Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>18. There is an ea&s;y Way of reconciling Male-contents.&mdash;<HI>Sunt
verba &amp; voces quibus hunc lenire
dolorem,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>19. A good Groom will rather &s;troke than &s;trike.</P>
<P>20. He who &s;aith there is no &s;uch Thing as
an hone&s;t Man, you may be &s;ure is him&s;elf a
Knave.</P>
<P>21. I have no Opinion of your bumper Patriots.
Some eat, &s;ome drink, &s;ome quarrel for their
Country. MODERN PATRIOTISM!</P>
<P>22. <HI>Ibycus</HI> is a carking, griping, clo&s;e-fi&s;ted Fellow.
It is odds that <HI>Ibycus</HI> is not a Patriot.</P>
<P>23. We are not to think every clamorous Ha|ranguer,
or every &s;plenetic Repiner again&s;t a Court,
is therefore a Patriot.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="110">
24. A Patriot is one who heartily wi&s;heth the
public Pro&s;perity, and doth not only wi&s;h, but al&s;o
&s;tudy and endeavour to promote it.</P>
<P>25. Game&s;ters, Fops, Rakes, Bullies, Stock-jobbers:
alas! what Patriots?</P>
<P>26. Some Writers have thought it impo&s;&s;ible
that Men &s;hould be brought to laugh at public
Spirit. Yet this hath been done in the pre&s;ent
Age.</P>
<P>27. The Patriot aims at his private Good in
the Public. The Knave makes the Public &s;ub&s;er|vient
to his private Intere&s;t. The former con&s;iders
him&s;elf as Part of a Whole, the latter con&s;iders
him&s;elf as the Whole.</P>
<P>28. There is and ever will be a natural Strife be|tween
Court and Country. The one will get as
much, and the other give as little as it can. How
mu&s;t the Patriot behave him&s;elf?</P>
<P>29. He gives the nece&s;&s;ary. If he gives more,
it is with a View of gaining more to his Country.</P>
<P>30. A Patriot will never barter the public Money
for his private Gain.</P>
<P>31. Moral Evil is never to be committed, phy|&s;ical
Evil may be incurred, either to avoid a greater
Evil, or to procure a good.</P>
<P>32. Where the Heart is right, there is true Pa|trioti&s;m.</P>
<P>33. In your Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s, it is ea&s;ier to meet
with a good Head than a good Heart.</P>
<P>34. A Patriot will admit there may be hone&s;t
Men, and that hone&s;t Men may differ.</P>
<P>35. He that always blames or always prai&s;es is
no Patriot.</P>
<P>36. Were all &s;weet and &s;neaking Courtiers, or
were all four Malecontents; in either Ca&s;e the
Public would thrive but ill.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="111">
37. A Patriot would hardly wi&s;h there was no
Contra&s;t in the State.</P>
<P>38. Ferments of the wor&s;t Kind &s;ucceed to per|fect
Inaction.</P>
<P>39. A Man rages, rails and raves; I &s;u&s;pect his
Patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>40. The fawning Courtier and the &s;urly 'Squire
often mean the &s;ame Thing, each his own Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>41. A Patriot will e&s;teem no Man for being of
his Party.</P>
<P>42. The factious Man is apt to mi&s;take him&s;elf
for a Patriot.</P>

<P>THE QUERIST was fir&s;t printed in the
Year One Thou&s;and Seven Hundred and
Thirty-five; &s;ince which Time, the Face of Things
is &s;omewhat changed. In this Edition, &s;ome Al|terations
have been made. The three Parts are

many omitted, particularly, of tho&s;e relating to the
Sketch or Plan of a national Bank; which it may
be time enough to take again in hand, when the
Public &s;hall &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed to make u&s;e of &s;uch an
Expedient. I had determined with my&s;elf never to
prefix my Name to the Queri&s;t, but in the la&s;t
Edition was over-ruled by a Friend, who was re|markable
for pur&s;uing the public&s; Intere&s;t with as
much Diligence, as others do their own. I appre|hend
the &s;ame Cen&s;ure on this, that I incurred upon
another Occa&s;ion, for meddling out of my pro|fe&s;&s;ion.
Though to feed the Hungry and clothe
the Naked, by promoting an hone&s;t Indu&s;try, will,
perhaps, be deemed no improper Employment for
a Clergyman, who &s;till thinks him&s;elf a Member
of the Commonwealth. As the Sum of human
Happine&s;s is &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t in the Goods of
Mind, Body and Fortune, I would fain make my
Studies of &s;ome U&s;e to Mankind, with regard to

the common Sort are well fed, clothed and lodged?</P>
<P>3. Whether the Drift and Aim of every wi&s;e
State &s;hould not be, to encourage Indu&s;try in its
Members? And, whether tho&s;e, who employ neither
Heads nor Hands for the common Benefit, de&s;erve
not to be expelled like Drones out of a well go|verned
State?</P>
<P>4. Whether the four Elements, and Man's Labour
therein, be not the true Source of Wealth?</P>
<P>5. Whether Money be not only &s;o far u&s;eful, as
it &s;tirreth up Indu&s;try, enabling Men mutually to
participate the Fruits of each others Labour?</P>
<P>6. Whether any other Means, equally conducing
to excite and circulate the Indu&s;try of Mankind,
may not be as u&s;eful as Money?</P>

Power?</P>

whether Action doth not follow Appetite or Will?</P>
<P>10. Whether Fa&s;hion doth not create Appetites;
and whether the prevailing Will of a Nation is not
the Fa&s;hion?</P>
<P>11. Whether the Current of Indu&s;try and Com|merce

<P>16. Whether Cu&s;toms and Fa&s;hions do not &s;up|ply
the Place of Rea&s;on, in the Vulgar of all Ranks?
Whether, therefore, it doth not very much import
that they &s;hould be wi&s;ely framed?</P>
<P>17. Whether the imitating tho&s;e Neighbours in

<P><PB N="121" REF="116">
19. Whether the Bulk of our <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Natives are

<P>20. Whether the creating of Wants be not the

And whether, if our Pea&s;ants were accu&s;tomed to
eat Beef and wear Shoes, they would not be more
indu&s;trious?</P>
<P>21. Whether other Things being given, as Cli|mate,
Soil, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Wealth be not proportioned
to the Indu&s;try, and this to the Circulation of Credit,
be the Credit circulated or transferred by what
Marks or Tokens &s;oever?</P>
<P>22. Whether, therefore, le&s;s Money, &s;wiftly cir|culating,
be not, in effect, equivalent to more
Money &s;lowly circulating? Or, whether, if the
Circulation be reciprocally as the Quantity of Coin,
the Nation can be a Lo&s;er?</P>
<P>23. Whether Money is to be con&s;idered as hav|ing
an intrin&s;ic Value, or as being a Commodity,
a Standard, a Mea&s;ure, or a Pledge, as is variou&s;ly
&s;ugge&s;ted by Writers? And whether the true Idea
of Money, as &s;uch, be not altogether that of a

<P>29. What makes a wealthy People? Whether
Mines of Gold and Silver are capable of doing this?
And whether the Negroes amid&s;t the Gold Sands of

<P>30. Whether there be any Virtue in Gold or
Silver, other than as they &s;et People at Work, or
create Indu&s;try?</P>
<P>31. Whether it be not the Opinion or Will of
the People, exciting them to Indu&s;try, that truly
enricheth a Nation? And whether this doth not
principally depend on the Means for counting, tran&s;|ferring,
and pre&s;erving Power, that is, Property of
all Kinds?</P>
<P>32. Whether if there was no Silver or Gold in
the Kingdom, our Trade might not neverthele&s;s
&s;upply Bills of Exchange, &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the
Demands of Ab&s;entees in <HI>England.</HI> or el&s;ewhere?</P>
<P>33. Whether current Bank-Notes may not be
deemed Money? And whether they are not actually
the greater Part of the Money of this Kingdom?</P>
<P>34. Provided the Wheels move, whether it is
not the &s;ame Thing, as to the Effect of the Ma|chine,
be this done by the Force of Wind, or Water, or
Animals?</P>
<P>35. Whether Power to command the Indu&s;try
of others be not real Wealth? And whether Money
<PB N="123" REF="118">
be not in truth, Tickets or Tokens for convey|ing
and recording &s;uch Power, and whether it be
of great Con&s;equence what Materials the Tickets
are made of?</P>
<P>36. Whether Trade, either foreign or dome&s;tic,
be in truth any more than this Commerce of In|du&s;try?</P>
<P>37. Whether to promote, transfer, and &s;ecure
this Commerce, and this Property in human Labour,
or, in other words, this Power, be not the &s;ole
Means of enriching a People, and how far this may
be done independently of Gold and Silver?</P>
<P>38. Whether it were not wrong to &s;uppo&s;e Land
it&s;elf to be Wealth? And whether the Indu&s;try of
the People is not fir&s;t to be con&s;idered, as that
which con&s;titutes Wealth, which makes even Land
and Silver to be Wealth, neither of which would
have any Value, but as Means and Motives to In|du&s;try?</P>
<P>39. Whether in the Wa&s;tes of <HI>America,</HI> a Man
might not po&s;&s;e&s;s twenty Miles &s;quare of Land, and
yet want his Dinner, or a Coat to his Back?</P>
<P>40. Whether a fertile Land, and the Indu&s;try
of its Inhabitants, would not prove inexhau&s;tible
Funds of real Wealth, be the Counters for convey|ing
and recording thereof what you will, Paper,
Gold, or Silver?</P>
<P>41. Whether a &s;ingle Hint be &s;ufficient to over|come
a Prejudice? And whether even obvious
Truths will not &s;ometimes bear repeating?</P>
<P>42. Whether if human Labour be the true
Source of Wealth, it doth not follow that Idlene&s;s
&s;hould of all Things be di&s;couraged in a wi&s;e State?</P>
<P>43. Whether even Gold, or Silver, if they &s;hould
le&s;&s;en the Indu&s;try of its Inhabitants, would not be
ruinous to a Country? And whether <HI>Spain</HI> be not
an In&s;tance of this?</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="119">
44. Whether the Opinion of Men, and their

<P>45. Whether there is in truth any &s;uch Trea&s;ure
lying dead? And whether it be of great Con&s;e|quence
to the Public, that it &s;hould be real, rather
than notional?</P>
<P>46. Whether in order to under&s;tand the true
Nature of Wealth and Commerce, it would not
be right to con&s;ider a Ship's Crew ca&s;t upon a de|&s;ert
I&s;land, and by degrees forming them&s;elves to
Bu&s;ine&s;s and civil Life, while Indu&s;try begot Credit,
and Credit moved to Indu&s;try?</P>
<P>47. Whether &s;uch Men would not all &s;et them|&s;elves
to Work? Whether they would not &s;ub&s;i&s;t
by the mutual Participation of each other's Indu&s;try?
Whether when one Man had in his Way procured
more than he could con&s;ume, he would not ex|change
his Superfluities to &s;upply his Wants?
Whether this mu&s;t not produce Credit? Whether
to facilitate the&s;e Conveyances, to record and cir|culate
this Credit, they would not &s;oon agree on
certain Tallies, Tokens, Tickets, or Counters?</P>
<P>48. Whether Reflexion in the better Sort might
not &s;oon remedy our Evils? And whether our real
Defect be not in a wrong Way of Thinking?</P>
<P>49. Whether it would not be an unhappy Turn
in our Gentlemen, if they &s;hould take more Thought
to create an Intere&s;t to them&s;elves in this or that
County, or Borough, than to promote the real In|tere&s;t
of their Country?</P>
<P>50. Whether if a Man builds a Hou&s;e he doth
not in the fir&s;t Place provide a Plan which governs
his Work? And &s;hall the Public act without an
End, a View, a Plan?</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="120">
51. Whether by how much the le&s;s particular
Folk think for them&s;elves, the Public be not &s;o
much the more obliged to think for them?</P>
<P>52. Whether &s;mall Gains be not the Way to
great Profit? And if our Trade&s;men are Beggars,
whether they may not thank them&s;elves for it?</P>
<P>53. Whether &s;ome Way might not be found for
making Criminals u&s;eful in public Works, in&s;tead
of &s;ending them either to <HI>America,</HI> or to the other
World?</P>
<P>54. Whether we may not, as well as other Na|tions,
contrive Employment for them? And
whether Servitude, Chains, and hard Labour, for a
Term of Years, would not be a more di&s;couraging,
as well as a more adequate Puni&s;hment for Felons,
than even Death it&s;elf?</P>
<P>55. Whether there are not &s;uch Things in <HI>Hol|land</HI>
as bettering Hou&s;es, for bringing young Gen|tlemen
to Order? And whether &s;uch an In&s;titution
would be u&s;ele&s;s among us?</P>
<P>56. Whether it be true, that the Poor in <HI>Hol|land</HI>
have no Re&s;ource but their own Labour, and
yet there are no Beggars in their Streets?</P>
<P>57. Whether he who&s;e Luxury con&s;umeth foreign
Products, and who&s;e Indu&s;try produceth nothing
dome&s;tic to exchange for them, is not &s;o far forth
injurious to his Country?</P>
<P>58. Whether Nece&s;&s;ity is not to be hearkened
to before Convenience, and Convenience before
Luxury?</P>
<P>59. Whether to provide plentifully for the Poor,
be not feeding the Root, the Sub&s;tance whereof will
&s;hoot upwards into the Branches, and cau&s;e the Top
to flouri&s;h?</P>

either <HI>Sweden</HI> or <HI>Denmark,</HI> and yet, whether tho&s;e
Nations pay ready Money as we do?</P>
<P>525. Whether it be not a Cu&s;tom for &s;ome thou|&s;ands
of <HI>Frenchmen</HI> to go about the Beginning of
<HI>March</HI> into <HI>Spain,</HI> and having tilled the Lands
and gathered the Harve&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> to return home

<P>550. Whether we of this I&s;land are not from
our peculiar Circum&s;tances determined to this very
Commerce above any other, from the Number of
Nece&s;&s;aries and good Things that we po&s;&s;e&s;s within

thrive, where Money is made a Means to Indu&s;try?
But whether Money without this would be a Ble&s;|&s;ing

<P>566. Whether keeping Ca&s;h at home, or &s;end|ing
it abroad, ju&s;t as it mo&s;t &s;erves to promote In|du&s;try,
be not the real Intere&s;t of every Nation?</P>
<P>567. Whether Commodities of all Kinds do not
naturally flow where there is the greate&s;t Demand?
Whether the greate&s;t Demand for a Thing be not
where it is of mo&s;t U&s;e? Whether Money, like
other Things, hath not its proper U&s;e? Whether
this U&s;e be not to circulate? Whether therefore

<P>568. Whether it is not a great Point to know
what we would be at? And whether whole States,

for want of this Knowledge?</P>
<P>569. Whether Gold may not be compared to

Circum&s;tances, the &s;ame Ends are not obtained by
different Means?</P>
<P>571. If we are a poor Nation, abounding with
very poor People, will it not follow, that a far
greater Proportion of our Stock &s;hould be in the
&s;malle&s;t and lowe&s;t Species, than would &s;uit with
<HI>England?</HI></P>
<P>572. Whether, therefore, it would not be high|ly
expedient, if our Money were coined of pecu|liar
Values, be&s;t fitted to the Circum&s;tances and
<PB N="183" REF="178">
U&s;es of our own Country; and whether any other
People could take Umbrage at our con&s;ulting our

and that lies within our&s;elves?</P>
<P>573. Whether every Man doth not know, and
hath not long known, that the Want of a Mint
cau&s;ech many other Wants in this Kingdom?</P>
<P>574. What Harm did <HI>England</HI> &s;u&s;tain about three

Kingdom?</P>
<P>575. What Harm was it to <HI>Spain</HI> that her Pro|vinces

<P>576. Whether it may not be pre&s;umed, that our
not, haying a Privilege, which every other King|dom

for it?</P>
<P>577. Whether it be not the Intere&s;t of <HI>England,</HI>
that we &s;hould cultivate a dome&s;tic Commerce
among our&s;elves? And whether it could give them
any po&s;&s;ible Jealou&s;y, if our &s;mall Sum of Ca&s;h was
contrived to go a little further, if there was a little

Wretches throughput the Towns and Villages of

<P>578. Whether <HI>Great Britain</HI> ought not to pro|mote
the Pro&s;perity of her Colonies, by all Me|thods
con&s;i&s;tent with her own? And whether the
Colonies them&s;elves ought to wi&s;h or aim at it by
others?</P>
<P>579. Whether the remote&s;t Parts from the Me|tropolis,

regarded as the Extremities and Capillaries of

improved by Exerci&s;e?</P>
<P>582. Whether the Sum of the Faculties put into
Act, or in other Words, the united Action of a
whole People doth not con&s;titute the <HI>Momentum</HI> of
a State?</P>
<P>583. Whether &s;uch <HI>Momentum</HI> be not the real
Stock or Wealth of a State; and whether its Cre|dit
be not proportionable thereunto?</P>
<P>584. Whether in every wi&s;e State the Faculties
of the Mind are not mo&s;t con&s;idered?</P>
<P>585. Whether the <HI>Momentum</HI> of a State doth
not imply the whole Exertion of its Faculties, intel|lectual
and corporeal; and whether the latter with|out
the former, could act in concert?</P>
<P>586. Whether the divided Force of Men, act|ing

the Force of a Community, de&s;erves, not to be
well con&s;idered and well under&s;tood?</P>
<P>590. Whether the immediate Mover, the Blood
and Spirits, be not Money, Paper or Metal, and
whether the Soul or Will of the Community, which
is the prime Mover that governs and directs the
Whole, be not the Legi&s;lature?</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="180">

<HEAD>A PROPOSAL
FOR
The better Supplying of Churches in
our foreign Plantations, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH there are &s;everal excellent
Per&s;ons of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e
good Intentions and Endeavours have not been
wanting to propagate the Go&s;pel in foreign Parts,
who have even combined into Societies for that very
Purpo&s;e, and given great Encouragement, not only
for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> but al&s;o,
for the Reformed of other Nations, led by their
Example, to propagate Chri&s;tianity in the <HI>Ea&s;t:</HI>
It is neverthele&s;s acknowledged, that there is at
this Day, but little Sen&s;e of Religion, and a mo&s;t
notorious Corruption of Manners, in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Colonies &s;ettled on the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> and
the I&s;lands. It is al&s;o acknowledged, that the
Go&s;pel hath hitherto made but a very incon&s;iderable
Progre&s;s among the neighbouring <HI>Americans,</HI> who
&s;till continue in much the &s;ame Ignorance and Bar|bari&s;m,
<PB N="192" REF="185">
in which we found them above a hundred
Years ago.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore venture to &s;ubmit my Thoughts
upon a Point, that I have long con&s;idered, to better
Judgments, in Hopes that any Expedient will be
favourably hearkened to, which is propo&s;ed for the
Remedy of the&s;e Evils. Now, in order to effect
this, it &s;hould &s;eem the natural proper Method, to
provide, in the fir&s;t Place, a con&s;tant Supply of
worthy Clergymen for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Churches in tho&s;e
Parts; and in the &s;econd Place, a like con&s;tant
Supply of zealous Mi&s;&s;ionaries, well fitted for pro|pagating
Chri&s;tianity among the Savages.</P>
<P>For though the &s;ure&s;t Means to reform the
Morals, and &s;often the Behaviour of Men, be, to
preach to them the pure uncorrupt Doctrine of the
Go&s;pel, yet it cannot be denied, that the Succe&s;s of
preaching dependeth in good mea&s;ure on the Cha|racter
and Skill of the Preacher: Fora&s;much as
Mankind are more apt to copy Characters than to
practi&s;e Precepts, and fora&s;much as Argument, to
attain its full Strength, doth not le&s;s require the Life
of Zeal, than the Weight of Rea&s;on; and the &s;ame
Doctrine, which maketh great Impre&s;&s;ion, when
delivered with Decency and Addre&s;s, lo&s;eth very
much of its Force by pa&s;&s;ing through aukward or
unskilful Hands.</P>
<P>Now the Clergy &s;ent over to <HI>America</HI> have proved,
too many of them, very meanly qualified both in
Learning and Morals for the Di&s;charge of their
Office. And indeed little can be expected from the
Example or In&s;truction of tho&s;e, who quit their
native Country on no other Motive, than that they
are not able to procure a Livelihood in it, which is
known to be often the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>To this may be imputed the &s;mall Care that hath
been taken to convert the Negroes of our Planta|tions,
<PB N="193" REF="186">
who, to the Infamy of <HI>England,</HI> and Scandal
of the World, continue Heathen under Chri&s;tian
Ma&s;ters, and in Chri&s;tian Countries. Which could
never be, if our Planters were rightly in&s;tructed
and made &s;en&s;ible, that they di&s;appointed their own
Bapti&s;m by denying it to tho&s;e who belong to them:
That it would be of Advantage to their Affairs, to
have Slaves who &s;hould <HI>obey in all Things their
Ma&s;ters according to the Fle&s;h, not with Eye-&s;ervice
as Men-plea&s;ers, but in Singlene&s;s of Heart as fear|ing
God:</HI> That Go&s;pel Liberty con&s;i&s;ts with temporal
Servitude; and that their Slaves would only become
better Slaves by being Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>And though it be allowed that &s;ome of the Clergy
in our Colonies have approved them&s;elves Men of
Merit, it will at the &s;ame time be allowed, that the
mo&s;t zealous and able Mi&s;&s;ionary from <HI>England</HI> mu&s;t
find him&s;elf but ill qualified for converting the
<HI>American</HI> Heathen, if we con&s;ider the Difference of
Language, their wild Way of Living, and above
all, the great Jealou&s;y and Prejudice which &s;avage
Nations have towards Foreigners, or Innovations
introduced by them.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations make it evident, that a
College or Seminary in tho&s;e Parts is very much
wanted; and therefore the providing &s;uch a Semi|nary,
is earne&s;tly propo&s;ed and recommended to all
tho&s;e, who have it in their Power to
contribute to &s;o good a Work. By this, two Ends would be
obtained.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the Youth of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations
might be them&s;elves fitted for the Mini&s;try; and
Men of Merit would be then glad to fill the
Churches of their native Country, which are now
a Drain for the very Dregs and Refu&s;e of ours.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, there are, I am told, many Churches
vacant in our Plantations, and many very ill &s;up|plied;
<PB N="194" REF="187">
nor can all the Vigilance and Wi&s;dom of
that great Prelate, who&s;e peculiar Care it is, pre|vent
this, &s;o long as the afore&s;aid Churches are
&s;upplied from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;upplied they mu&s;t be, with &s;uch as can be
picked up in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> until a Nur&s;ery of
Learning for the Education of the Natives is
founded. This indeed might provide a con&s;tant
Succe&s;&s;ion of learned and exemplary Pa&s;tors; and
what Effect this mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have on their
Flocks, I need not &s;ay.</P>
<P>Secondly, the Children of &s;avage <HI>Americans,</HI>
brought up in &s;uch a Seminary, and well in&s;tructed
in Religion and Learning, might make the able&s;t
and propere&s;t Mi&s;&s;ionaries for &s;preading the Go&s;pel
among their Countrymen; who would be le&s;s apt
to &s;u&s;pect, and readier to embrace a Doctrine re|commended
by Neighbours or Relations, Men of
their own Blood and Language, than if it were pro|po&s;ed
by Foreigners, who would not improbably be
thought to have De&s;igns on the Liberty or Property
of their Converts.</P>
<P>The young <HI>Americans</HI> nece&s;&s;ary for this Purpo&s;e,
may in the Beginning be procured, either by
peaceable Methods from tho&s;e &s;avage Nations,
which border on our Colonies, and are in Friend|&s;hip
with us, or by taking captive the Children of
our Enemies.</P>
<P>It is propo&s;ed to admit into the afore&s;aid College
only &s;uch Savages as are under ten Years of Age,
before evil Habits have taken a deep root; and yet
not &s;o early as to prevent retaining their Mother
Tongue, which &s;hould be pre&s;erved by Intercour&s;e
among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is further propo&s;ed, to ground the&s;e young
<HI>Americans</HI> thoroughly in Religion and Morality,
and to give them a good Tincture of other Learn|ing;
<PB N="195" REF="188">
particularly of Eloquence, Hi&s;tory, and prac|tical
Mathematicks; to which it may not be im|proper
to add &s;ome Skill in Phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>If there were a yearly Supply of ten or a dozen
&s;uch Mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;ent abroad into their re&s;pective
Countries, after they had received the Degree of
Ma&s;ter of Arts in the afore&s;aid College, and Holy
Orders in <HI>England,</HI> (till &s;uch Time as Epi&s;copacy
be e&s;tabli&s;hed in tho&s;e Parts) it is hardly to be doubt|ed,
but, in a little time, the World would &s;ee
good and great Effects thereof.</P>
<P>For, to any con&s;idering Man, the employing
<HI>American</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries for the Conver&s;ion of <HI>America,</HI>
will, of all others, appear the mo&s;t likely Method
to &s;ucceed; e&s;pecially if care be taken, that, dur|ing
the whole Cour&s;e of their Education, an Eye
&s;hould be had to their Mi&s;&s;ion; that they &s;hould
be taught betimes to con&s;ider them&s;elves as trained
up in that &s;ole View, without any other Pro&s;pect
of Provi&s;ion, or Employment; that a Zeal for
Religion, and Love of their Country, &s;hould be
early and con&s;tantly in&s;tilled into their Minds, by
repeated Lectures and Admonitions; that they
&s;hould not only be incited by the common Topics
of Religion and Nature, but farther animated and
inflamed by the great Examples in pa&s;t Ages, of
public Spirit and Virtue, to re&s;cue their Country|men
from their &s;avage Manners, to a Life of Ci|vility
and Religion.</P>
<P>If his Maje&s;ty would graciou&s;ly plea&s;e to grant a
Charter for a College to be erected in a proper
Place for the&s;e U&s;es, it is to be hoped a Fund may
be &s;oon rai&s;ed, by the Contribution of well di&s;|po&s;ed
Per&s;ons, &s;ufficient for building and endowing
the &s;ame. For as the nece&s;&s;ary Expence would be
&s;mall, &s;o there are Men of Religion and Humanity
in <HI>England,</HI> who would be plea&s;ed to &s;ee any De&s;ign
<PB N="196" REF="189">
&s;et forward for the Glory of God and the Good of
Mankind.</P>
<P>A &s;mall Expence would &s;uffice to &s;ub&s;i&s;t and
educate the <HI>American</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries in a plain &s;imple
Manner, &s;uch as might make it ea&s;y for them to
return to the coar&s;e and poor Methods of Life in
u&s;e among their Countrymen; and nothing can
contribute more to le&s;&s;en this Expence, than a ju|dicious
Choice of the Situation, where the Seminary
is to &s;tand.</P>
<P>Many Things ought to be con&s;idered in the
Choice of a Situation. It &s;hould be in a good
Air; in a Place where Provi&s;ions are cheap and
plenty; where an Intercour&s;e might ea&s;ily be kept
up with all Parts of <HI>America</HI> and the I&s;lands; in a
Place of Security, not expo&s;ed to the In&s;ults of
Pirates, Savages, or other Enemies; where there
is no great Trade, which might tempt the Readers
or Fellows of the College to become Merchants,
to the Neglect of their proper Bu&s;ine&s;s; where
there are neither Riches nor Luxury to divert, or
le&s;&s;en their Application, or to make them unea&s;y
and di&s;&s;atisfied with a homely frugal Sub&s;i&s;tence;
la&s;tly, where the Inhabitants, if &s;uch a Place may be
found, are noted for Innocence and Simplicity of
Manners. I need not &s;ay of how great Importance
this Point would be toward forming the Morals of
young Students, and what mighty Influence it mu&s;t
have on the Mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is evident the College long &s;ince projected in
<HI>Barbadoes,</HI> would be defective in many of the&s;e
Particulars; for though it may have its U&s;e among
the Inhabitants, yet a Place of &s;o high Trade, &s;o
much Wealth and Luxury, and &s;uch di&s;&s;olute
Morals, (not to mention the great Price and Scarcity
of Provi&s;ions;) mu&s;t at fir&s;t Sight &s;eem a very im|proper
Situation for a general Seminary intended
<PB N="197" REF="190">
for the forming Mi&s;&s;ionaries, and educating Youth
in Religion and Sobriety of Manners. The &s;ame
Objections lie again&s;t the neighbouring I&s;lands.</P>
<P>And if we con&s;ider the Accounts given of their
Avarice and Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, their Coldne&s;s in the
Practice of Religion, and their Aver&s;ion from
propagating it, (which appears in the withholding
their Slaves from Bapti&s;m) it is to be feared, that
the Inhabitants in the populous Parts of our Plan|tations
on the Continent are not much fitter, than
tho&s;e in the I&s;lands abovementioned, to influence
or a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;uch a De&s;ign. And as to the more remote
and le&s;s frequented Parts, the Difficulty of being
&s;upplied with Nece&s;&s;aries, the Danger of being ex|po&s;ed
to the Inroads of Savages, and above all, the
Want of Intercour&s;e with other Places, render
them improper Situations for a Seminary of Re|ligion
and Learning.</P>
<P>It will not be ami&s;s to in&s;ert here an Ob&s;ervation
I remember to have &s;een in an Ab&s;tract of the
Proceedings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> annexed to the Dean of <HI>Canter|bury</HI>'s
Sermon, before the Society for the Propa|gation
of the Go&s;pel in foreign Parts; that the
&s;avage <HI>Indians,</HI> who live on the Continent, will not
&s;uffer their Children to learn <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Dutch,</HI> le&s;t
they &s;hould be debauched by conver&s;ing with
their <HI>European</HI> Neighbours; which is a melancholy
but &s;trong Confirmation of the Truth of what hath
been now advanced.</P>
<P>A general Intercour&s;e and Corre&s;pondence with
all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies, both on the I&s;lands and
the Continent, and with other Parts of <HI>America,</HI>
hath been before laid down, as a nece&s;&s;ary Circum|&s;tance,
the Rea&s;on whereof is very evident. But
this Circum&s;tance is hardly to be found. For on
the Continent, where there are neither Inns, nor
Carriages, nor Bridges over the Rivers, there is
<PB N="198" REF="191">
no travelling by Land between di&s;tant Places.
And the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Settlements are reputed to extend
along the Sea-coa&s;t for the Space of fifteen hun|dred
Miles. It is therefore plain, there can be
no convenient Communication between them,
otherwi&s;e than by Sea; no Advantage therefore,
in this Point, can be gained by &s;ettling on the
Continent.</P>
<P>There is another Con&s;ideration which equally
regards the Continent and I&s;lands, that the general
Cour&s;e of Trade and Corre&s;pondence lies from all
tho&s;e Colonies to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> alone: Whereas,
for our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to
pitch upon a Place, if &s;uch could be found, which
maintains a con&s;tant Intercour&s;e with all the other
Colonies, and who&s;e Commerce lies chiefly or alto|gether
(not in <HI>Europe,</HI> but) in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>There is but one Spot that I can find, to which
this Circum&s;tance agrees; and that is the I&s;les of
<HI>Bermuda,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>The Summer I&s;lands.</HI> The&s;e
having no rich Commodity or Manufacture, &s;uch as
Sugar, Tobacco, or the like, wherewithal to trade
to <HI>England,</HI> are obliged to become Carriers for
<HI>America,</HI> as the <HI>Dutch</HI> are for <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Ber|mudans</HI>
are excellent Shipwrights and Sailors, and
have a great Number of very good Sloops, which
are always pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing from all Parts of
<HI>America.</HI> They drive a con&s;tant Trade to the
I&s;lands of <HI>Jamaica, Barbadoes, Antego,</HI> &amp;c. with
Butter, Onions, Cabbages, and other Roots and
Vegetables, which they have in great Plenty and
Perfection. They have al&s;o &s;ome &s;mall Manu|factures
of Joiners Work and Matting, which
they export to the Plantations on the Continent.
Hence <HI>Bermudan</HI> Sloops are oftner &s;een in the Ports
of <HI>America,</HI> than any other. And indeed, by the
be&s;t Information I could get, it appears they are the
<PB N="199" REF="192">
only People of all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plantations, who hold
a general Corre&s;pondence with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>And, as the Commerce of <HI>Bermuda</HI> renders it a
very fit Place, wherein to erect a Seminary, &s;o
likewi&s;e doth its Situation, it being placed between
our Plantations on the Continent, and tho&s;e in the
I&s;les, &s;o as equally to re&s;pect both. To
which may be added, that it lies in the Way of Ve&s;&s;els
pa&s;&s;ing from <HI>America</HI> to <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> all which
makes it plain, that the Youth, to be educated in
a Seminary placed in the <HI>Summer I&s;lands,</HI> would
have frequent Opportunities of going thither and
corre&s;ponding with their Friends. It mu&s;t indeed
be owned, that &s;ome will be obliged to go a long
Way to any one Place, which we &s;uppo&s;e re&s;orted
to, from all Parts of our Plantations; but if we
were to look out a Spot the neare&s;t approaching
to an equal Di&s;tance from all the re&s;t, I believe it
would be found to be <HI>Bermuda.</HI> It remains, that
we &s;ee whether it enjoys the other Qualities or Con|ditions
laid down as well as this.</P>
<P><HI>The Summer I&s;lands</HI> are &s;ituated near the Latitude
of thirty three Degrees; no Part of the World
enjoys a purer Air, or a more temperate Climate,
the great Ocean which environs them, at once mo|derating
the Heat of the South Winds, and the
Severity of the North-We&s;t. Such a Latitude on
the Continent might be thought too hot; but the
Air in <HI>Bermuda</HI> is perpetually fanned and kept cool
by Sea-breezes, which render the Weather the mo&s;t
healthy and delightful that could be wi&s;hed, being,
(as is affirmed by Per&s;ons who have long lived there)
of one equal Tenour almo&s;t throughout the whole
Year, like the latter End of a fine <HI>May;</HI> in&s;omuch
that it is re&s;orted to as the <HI>Montpellier</HI> of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e I&s;les (if we may believe the Ac|counts
given of them) le&s;s remarkable for Plenty
<PB N="200" REF="193">
than for Health; there being, be&s;ides Beef, Mut|ton
and Fowl, great Abundance of Fruits, and
Garden-&s;tuff of all Kinds in Perfection: To this,
if we add the great Plenty and Variety of Fi&s;h,
which is every Day taken on their Coa&s;ts, it would
&s;eem, that a Seminary could no where be &s;upplied
with better Provi&s;ions, or cheaper than here.</P>
<P>About forty Years ago, upon cutting down many
tall Cedars that &s;heltered their Orange-trees from
the North-We&s;t Wind, (which &s;ometimes blows
even there, &s;o as to affect that delicate Plant)
great Part of their Orange Plantations &s;uffered; but
other Cedars are &s;ince grown up, and no doubt, a
little Indu&s;try would again produce as great Plenty
of Oranges as ever was there heretofore. I men|tion
this, becau&s;e &s;ome have inferred from the
pre&s;ent Scarcity of that Fruit, for which <HI>Bermuda</HI>
was once &s;o famous, that there hath been a change
in the Soil and Climate for the wor&s;e. But this,
as hath been ob&s;erved, proceeded from another
Cau&s;e, which is now in great mea&s;ure taken away.</P>
<P><HI>Bermuda</HI> is a Clu&s;ter of &s;mall I&s;lands, which lie
in a very narrow Compa&s;s, containing in all, not
quite twenty thou&s;and Acres. This Groupe of I&s;les
is (to u&s;e Mr. <HI>Waller</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ion) walled round
with Rocks, which render them inacce&s;&s;ible to Pi|rates
or Enemies; there being but two narrow
Entrances, both well guarded by Forts. It would
therefore be impo&s;&s;ible to find any where, a more
&s;ecure Retreat for Students.</P>
<P>The Trade of <HI>Bermuda</HI> con&s;i&s;ts only in
Garden&s;tuff, and &s;ome poor Manufactures, principally of
Cedar and the Palmetto-leaf. <HI>Bermuda</HI> Hats are
worn by our Ladies: They are made of a Sort of
Mat, or (as they call it) Platting made of the Pal|metto-leaf,
which is the only Commodity that I
can find exported from <HI>Bermuda</HI> to <HI>Great-Britain;</HI>
<PB N="201" REF="194">
and as there is no Pro&s;pect; of making a Fortune by
this &s;mall Trade, &s;o it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to tempt
the Fellows of the College to engage in it, to the
Neglect of their peculiar Bu&s;ine&s;s, which might
po&s;&s;ibly be the Ca&s;e el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Such as their Trade is, &s;uch is their Wealth;
the Inhabitants being much poorer than the other
Colonies, who do not fail to de&s;pi&s;e them upon
that Account. But if they have le&s;s Wealth, they
have withal le&s;s Vice and expen&s;ive Folly than
their Neighbours. They are repre&s;ented as a con|tented,
plain, innocent Sort of People, free from
Avarice and Luxury, as well as the other Corruptions
that attend tho&s;e Vices.</P>
<P>I am al&s;o informed, that they are more con&s;tant
Attendants on divine Service, more kind and re|&s;pectful
to their Pa&s;tor (when they have one) and
&s;hew much more Humanity to their Slaves, and
Charity to one another, than is ob&s;erved among
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the other Plantations: One Rea&s;on
of this may be, that condemned Criminals, being
employed in the Manufactures of Sugar and To|bacco,
were never tran&s;ported thither. But, what|ever
be the Cau&s;e, the Facts are atte&s;ted by a
Clergyman of good Credit, who lived long among
them.</P>
<P>Among a People of this Character, and in a
Situation thus circum&s;tantiated, it would &s;eem that
a Seminary of Religion and Learning might very
fitly be placed. The Corre&s;pondence with other
Parts of <HI>America,</HI> the Goodne&s;s of the Air, the
Plenty and Security of the Place, the Frugality and
Innocence of the Inhabitants, all con&s;piring to fa|vour
&s;uch a De&s;ign. Thus much at lea&s;t is evident,
that young Students would be there le&s;s liable to
be corrupted in their Morals; and the governing
Part would be ea&s;ier, and better contented with a
<PB N="202" REF="195">
&s;mall Stipend, and a retired academical Life, in a
Corner from whence Avarice and Luxury are ex|cluded,
than they can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the
mid&s;t of a full Trade and great Riches, attended
with all that high Living and Parade which our
Planters affect, and which, as well as all fa&s;hionable
Vices, &s;hould be far removed from the Eyes of
the young <HI>American</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries, who are to lead
a Life of Poverty and Self-denial among their
Countrymen.</P>
<P>After all, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that though
every Thing el&s;e &s;hould concur with our Wi&s;hes,
yet if a Set of good Governors and Teachers be
wanting, who are acquainted with the Methods of
Education, and have the Zeal and Ability requi&s;ite
for carrying on a De&s;ign of this Nature, it would
certainly come to nothing.</P>
<P>An In&s;titution of this Kind &s;hould be &s;et on
Foot by Men of Prudence, Spirit and Zeal, as well
as competent Learning, who &s;hould be led to it
by other Motives than the Nece&s;&s;ity of picking up
a Maintenance. For upon this View, what Man of
Merit can be &s;uppo&s;ed to quit his native Country,
and take up with a poor College Sub&s;i&s;tence in
another Part of the World, where there are &s;o
many con&s;iderable Pari&s;hes actually void, and &s;o
many others ill &s;upplied for want of fitting In|cumbents?
Is it likely, that Fellow&s;hips of fifty
or &s;ixty Pounds a Year &s;hould tempt abler or wor|thier
Men, than Benefices of many Times their Value?</P>
<P>And except able and worthy Men do fir&s;t engage
in this Affair, with a Re&s;olution to exert them&s;elves
in forming the Manners of the Youth, and giving
them a proper Education, it is evident the Mi&s;&s;ion
and the College will be but in a very bad Way.
This Inconvenience &s;eems the mo&s;t difficult to pro|vide
<PB N="204" REF="196">
again&s;t, and, if not provided again&s;t, it will
be the mo&s;t likely to ob&s;truct any De&s;ign of this
Nature. So true it is, that where Ignorance or ill
Manners once take place in a Seminary, they are
&s;ure to be handed down in a Succe&s;&s;ion of illiterate
or worthle&s;s Men.</P>
<P>But this Apprehen&s;ion, which &s;eems &s;o well
grounded, that a College in any Part of <HI>America,</HI>
would either lie unprovided, or be wor&s;e provided
than their Churches are, hath no Place in <HI>Bermuda;</HI>
there being at this Time &s;everal Gentlemen, in all
Re&s;pects very well qualified, and in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
good Preferments, and fair Pro&s;pects at home, who
having &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered the great Benefit that
may ari&s;e to the Church and to Mankind from &s;uch
an Undertaking, are ready to engage in it, and to
dedicate the Remainder of their Lives to the in|&s;tructing
the Youth of <HI>America,</HI> and pro&s;ecuting
their own Studies upon a very moderate Sub&s;i&s;tence
in a Retirement, &s;o &s;weet and &s;o &s;ecure, and every
way &s;o well fitted for a Place of Education and
Study, as <HI>Bermuda.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much the Writer hereof thought him&s;elf
obliged to &s;ay of his A&s;&s;ociates: For him&s;elf, he
can only &s;ay, that as he values no Preferment upon
Earth, &s;o much as that of being employed in
the Execution of this De&s;ign; &s;o he hopes to
make up for other Defects, by the Sincerity of his
Endeavours.</P>
<P>In <HI>Europe,</HI> the Prote&s;tant Religion hath of late
Years con&s;iderably lo&s;t ground, and <HI>America</HI> &s;eems
the likelie&s;t Place, wherein to make up for what
hath been lo&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> provided the proper
Methods are taken: Otherwi&s;e the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mi&s;&s;i|onaries
in the South, and the <HI>French</HI> in the North,
are making &s;uch a Progre&s;s, as may one Day
&s;pread the Religion of <HI>Rome,</HI> and with it the u&s;ual

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">

Hatred to Prote&s;tants, throughout all the &s;avage
Nations in <HI>America;</HI> which would probably end in
the utter Extirpation of our Colonies, on the Safety
whereof depends &s;o much of the Nation's Wealth,
and &s;o con&s;iderable a Branch of his Maje&s;ty's Re|venue.</P>
<P>But if this Scheme were pur&s;ued, it would in
all probability have much greater Influence on the
<HI>Americans,</HI> than the utmo&s;t Endeavours of Popi&s;h
Emi&s;&s;aries can po&s;&s;ibly have; who from the Dif|ference
of Country, Language and Intere&s;t, mu&s;t
lie under far greater Difficulties and Di&s;courage|ments
than tho&s;e, whom we &s;uppo&s;e yearly &s;ent
out from <HI>Bermuda</HI> to preach among their Coun|trymen.</P>
<P>It cannot indeed be denied, that the great Num|ber
of poor Regulars, inured to hard Living, and
brought up in an implicit Obedience to their Su|periors,
hath hitherto given the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
in regard to her Mi&s;&s;ions, great Advantage over
the Reformed Churches. But from what hath been
&s;aid, it is, I think, evident, that this Advantage
may be over-balanced by our employing <HI>American</HI>
Mi&s;&s;ionaries.</P>
<P>Nor is the Honour of the Crown, Nation, and
Church of <HI>England</HI> unconcerned in this Scheme;
which, it is to be hoped, will remove the Reproach,
we have &s;o long lain under, that we fall as far &s;hort
of our Neighbours of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Communion in
Zeal for propagating Religion, as we &s;urpa&s;s them
in the Soundne&s;s and Purity of it. And at the &s;ame
time, that the doing what may be &s;o ea&s;ily done,
takes away our Reproach; it will ca&s;t no &s;mall
Lu&s;tre on his Maje&s;ty's Reign, and derive a Ble&s;&s;ing
from Heaven on his Admini&s;tration and tho&s;e who
live under the Influence thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="200">
Men of narrow Minds have a peculiar Talent at
Objection, being never at a lo&s;s for &s;omething to
&s;ay again&s;t what&s;oever is not of their own propo&s;ing.
And perhaps, it will be &s;aid in Oppo&s;ition to this
Propo&s;al, that if we thought our&s;elves capable of
gaining Converts to the Church, we ought to begin
with Infidels, Papi&s;ts, and Di&s;&s;enters of all De|nominations
at home, and to make Pro&s;elytes of
the&s;e before we think of Foreigners; and that there|fore
our Scheme is again&s;t Duty. And further,
that con&s;idering the great Oppo&s;ition, which is
found on the Part of tho&s;e who differ from us at
home, no Succe&s;s can be expected among Savages
abroad, and that therefore it is again&s;t Rea&s;on and
Experience.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this I &s;ay, that Religion like Light
is imparted without being dimini&s;hed. That what|ever
is done abroad, can be no Hindrance or Lett
to the Conver&s;ion of Infidels or others at home.
That tho&s;e who engage in this Affair, imagine they
will not be mi&s;&s;ed, where there is no want of
Schools or Clergy; but that they may be of &s;ingu|lar
Service in Countries but thinly &s;upplied with
either, or altogether deprived of both: That our
Colonies being of the &s;ame Blood, Language and
Religion, with our&s;elves, are in effect our Country|men.
But that Chri&s;tian Charity, not being limited
by tho&s;e Regards, doth extend to all Mankind.
And this may &s;erve for an An&s;wer to the fir&s;t Point,
that our De&s;ign is again&s;t Duty.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd Point I an&s;wer: That Ignorance
is not &s;o incurable as Error; that you mu&s;t pull
down as well as build, era&s;e as well as imprint, in
order to make Pro&s;elytes at home: Whereas, the
&s;avage <HI>Americans,</HI> if they are in a State purely na|tural,
and unimproved by Education, they are al&s;o
unincumbred with all that Rubbi&s;h of Super&s;tition
<PB N="206" REF="201">
and Prejudice, which is the Effect of a wrong one.
As they are le&s;s in&s;tructed, they are withal le&s;s
conceited and more teachable. And not being
violently attached to any fal&s;e Sy&s;tem of their own,
are &s;o much the fitter to receive that which is true.
Hence it is evident, that Succe&s;s abroad ought not
to be mea&s;ured by that which we ob&s;erve at home,
and that the Inference, which was made from the
Difficulty of the one to the Impo&s;&s;ibility of the
other, is altogether groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>It hath more the Appearance of Rea&s;on to object
(what will po&s;&s;ibly be objected by &s;ome) that this
Scheme hath been already tried to no Purpo&s;e, &s;e|veral
<HI>Indians</HI> having returned to their &s;avage Man|ners
after they had been taught to write and read,
and in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian Religion; a clear
Proof that their natural Stupidity is not to be over|come
by Education.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this, I &s;ay that the Scheme now
propo&s;ed hath never been tried, fora&s;much as a
thorough Education in Religion and Morality, in
divine and human Learning, doth not appear to
have been ever given to any &s;avage <HI>American:</HI> That
much is to be hoped from a Man ripe in Years,
and well grounded in Religion and u&s;eful Know|ledge,
while little or nothing can be expected from
a Youth but &s;lightly in&s;tructed in the Elements of
either: That from the Mi&s;carriage or gro&s;s Stu|pidity
of &s;ome, a general Incapacity of all <HI>Americans</HI>
cannot be fairly inferred: That they &s;hew as much
natural Sen&s;e as other uncultivated Nations: That
the Empires of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> were evident
Proofs of their Capacity, in which there appeared
a Reach of Politics, and a Degree of Art and Po|litene&s;s,
which no <HI>European</HI> People were ever known
to have arrived at without the U&s;e of Letters or of
<PB N="207" REF="202">
Iron, and which &s;ome perhaps have fallen &s;hort of
with both tho&s;e Advantages.</P>
<P>To what hath been &s;aid, it may not be improper
to add, that young <HI>Americans,</HI> educated in an
I&s;land at &s;ome Di&s;tance from their own Country,
will more ea&s;ily be kept under Di&s;cipline till they
have attained a compleat Education, than on the
Continent; where they might find Opportunities
of running away to their Countrymen, and return|ing
to their brutal Cu&s;toms, before they were
thoroughly imbued with good Principles and
Habits.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be acknowledged a difficult
Attempt, to plant Religion among the <HI>Americans,</HI>
&s;o long as they continue their wild and roving
Life. He who is obliged to hunt for his daily Food,
will have little Curio&s;ity or Lei&s;ure to receive In|&s;truction.
It would &s;eem therefore the right Way,
to introduce Religion and civil Life at the &s;ame
Time into that Part of the World: either Attempt
will a&s;&s;i&s;t and promote the other. Tho&s;e therefore
of the young Savages, who upon Trial are found
le&s;s likely to improve by academical Studies, may
be taught Agriculture, or the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Trades.
And when Husbandmen, Weavers, Carpenters,
and the like, have planted tho&s;e u&s;eful Arts among
their &s;avage Countrymen, and taught them to live
in &s;ettled Habitations, to canton out their Land and
till it, to provide vegetable Food of all Kinds, to
pre&s;erve Flocks and Herds of Cattle, to make
convenient Hou&s;es, and to clothe them&s;elves decent|ly:
This will a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;preading the Go&s;pel among
them; this will di&s;po&s;e them to &s;ocial Virtues, and
enable them to &s;ee and to feel the Advantages of a
religious and civil Education.</P>
<P>And that this View of propagating the Go&s;pel
and civil Life among the &s;avage Nations of <HI>America,</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="203">
was a principal Motive which induced the Crown
to &s;end the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies thither, doth ap|pear
from the Charter granted by King <HI>James</HI> I.
to the Adventurers in <HI>Virginia. See</HI> Purchas'<HI>s Pil|grims,
Vol. 4. b.</HI> I. <HI>c.</HI> 9. And it is now but ju&s;t
(what might then &s;eem charitable) that the&s;e poor
Creatures &s;hould receive &s;ome Advantage with re|&s;pect
to their &s;piritual Intere&s;ts, from tho&s;e who
have &s;o much improved their temporal, by &s;ettling
among them.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t true, notwith&s;tanding our pre&s;ent
Corruptions, that there are to be found in no
Country under the Sun Men of better Inclinations,
or greater Abilities for doing Good, than in <HI>Eng|land.</HI>
But it is as true, that Succe&s;s, in many
Ca&s;es, depends not upon Zeal, Indu&s;try, Wealth,
Learning, or the like Faculties, &s;o much as on the
Method, wherein the&s;e are applied. We often &s;ee
a &s;mall Proportion of Labour and Expence in one
Way, bring that about, which in others, a much
greater Share of both could never effect. It hath
been my Endeavour to di&s;cover this Way or
Method in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. What hath been
done, I &s;ubmit to the Judgment of all good and
rea&s;onable Men; who, I am per&s;uaded, will never
reject or di&s;courage a Propo&s;al of this Nature, on
the Score of &s;light Objections, Surmi&s;es, or Diffi|culties,
and thereby render them&s;elves chargeable
with the having prevented tho&s;e good Effects, which
might otherwi&s;e have been produced by it.</P>
<P>For it is, after all, po&s;&s;ible, that unfore&s;een
Difficulties may ari&s;e in the Pro&s;ecution of this
De&s;ign, many Things may retard, and many
Things may threaten to ob&s;truct it; but there is
hardly any Enterpri&s;e or Scheme what&s;oever, for
the public Good, in which Difficulties are not often
&s;hewing them&s;elves, and as often overcome by the
<PB N="209" REF="204">
Ble&s;&s;ing of God, upon the Prudence and Re&s;olution
of the Undertakers; though, for ought that ap|pears,
the pre&s;ent Scheme is as likely to &s;ucceed,
and attended with as few Difficulties, as any of this
Kind can po&s;&s;ibly be.</P>
<P>For to any Man, who con&s;iders the divine Power
of Religion, the innate Force of Rea&s;on and Virtue,
and the mighty Effects often wrought by the con|&s;tant
regular Operation even of a weak and &s;mall
Cau&s;e; it will &s;eem natural and rea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e,
that Rivulets perpetually i&s;&s;uing forth from a
Fountain, or Re&s;ervoir, of Learning and Religion,
and &s;treaming through all Parts of <HI>America,</HI> mu&s;t
in due time have a great Effect, in purging away
the ill Manners and Irreligion of our Colonies, as
well as the Blindne&s;s and Barbarity of the Nations
round them: E&s;pecially, if the Re&s;ervoir be in a
clean and private Place, where its Waters, out of
the Way of any Thing that may corrupt them, re|main
clear and pure; otherwi&s;e they are more likely
to pollute than purify the Places through which they
flow.</P>
<P>The Greatne&s;s of a Benefaction is rather in Pro|portion
to the Number and Want of the Receivers,
than to the Liberality of the Giver. A wi&s;e and
good Man would therefore be frugal in the Manage|ment
of his Charity; that is, contrive it &s;o as that
it might extend to the greate&s;t Wants of the greate&s;t
Number of his Fellow-creatures. Now the greate&s;t
Wants are &s;piritual Wants, and by all Accounts
the&s;e are no where greater than in our we&s;tern Plan|tations,
in many Parts whereof divine Service is
never performed for want of Clergymen; in others,
after &s;uch a Manner and by &s;uch Hands, as &s;can|dalize
even the wor&s;t of their own Pari&s;hioners;
where many <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in&s;tead of gaining Converts,
are them&s;elves degenerated into Heathens, being
<PB N="210" REF="205">
Members of no Church, without Morals, with|out
Faith, without Bapti&s;m. There can be there|fore,
in no Part of the Chri&s;tian World, a great|er
Want of &s;piritual Things than in our Plan|tations.</P>
<P>And, on the other hand, no Part of the Gen|tile
World are &s;o inhuman and barbarous as the &s;a|vage
<HI>Americans,</HI> who&s;e chief Employment and De|light
con&s;i&s;ting in Cruelty and Revenge, their Lives
mu&s;t of all others, be mo&s;t oppo&s;ite, as well to the
Light of Nature, as to the Spirit of the Go&s;pel.
Now to reclaim the&s;e poor Wretches, to prevent
the many Torments and cruel Deaths which they
daily inflict on each other, to contribute in any
&s;ort to put a Stop to the numberle&s;s horrid Crimes
which they commit without Remor&s;e, and in&s;tead
thereof to introduce the Practice of Virtue and
Piety, mu&s;t &s;urely be a Work in the highe&s;t
Degree becoming every &s;incere and charitable
Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who wi&s;h well to Religion and Mankind,
will need no other Motive to forward an Under|taking
calculated for the Service of both: I &s;hall,
neverthele&s;s, beg leave to ob&s;erve, that whoever
would be glad to cover a Multitude of Sins by an
exten&s;ive and well-judged Charity, or whoever,
from an excellent and God-like Temper of Mind,
&s;eeks Opportunities of doing Good in his Genera|tion,
will be plea&s;ed to meet with a Scheme that &s;o
peculiarly puts it in his Power, with &s;mall Trouble
or Expence, to procure a great and la&s;ting Benefit
to the World.</P>
<P>Ten Pounds a Year, would (if I mi&s;take not) be
&s;ufficient to defray the Expence of a young <HI>Ameri|can</HI>
in the College of <HI>Bermuda,</HI> as to Diet, Lodg|ing,
Clothes, Books and Education: And if &s;o,
the Intere&s;t of two hundred Pounds may be a per|petual
<PB N="211" REF="206">
Fund for maintaining one Mi&s;&s;ionary at the
College, for ever; and in this Succe&s;&s;ion, many,
it is to be hoped, may become powerful In&s;tru|ments
for converting to Chri&s;tianity and civil Life
whole Nations, who now &s;it in Darkne&s;s and the
Shadow of Death, and who&s;e cruel brutal Manners
are a Di&s;grace to human Nature.</P>
<P>A Benefaction of this Kind &s;eems to enlarge the
very Being of a Man, extending it to di&s;tant Places
and to future Times; ina&s;much as un&s;een Coun|tries
and after Ages, may feel the Effects of his
Bounty, while he him&s;elf reaps the Reward in the
ble&s;&s;ed Society of all tho&s;e, who, <HI>having turned
many to Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hine as the Stars for ever
end ever.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOHN xvii. 3.</BIBL>
<Q>This is Life Eternal, that they may know thee the only
true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT human Kind were not de&s;igned meer|ly
to &s;ojourn a few Days upon this Earth:
that a Being of &s;uch Excellence as the Soul of
Man, &s;o capable of a nobler Life, and having &s;uch
a high Sen&s;e of Things moral and intellectual, was
not created in the &s;ole View of being impri&s;oned in
an earthly Tabernacle, and partaking a few Pains
and Plea&s;ures which checker this mortal Life, with|out
a&s;piring to any Thing either above or beyond
it, is a fundamental Doctrine as well of natural Re|ligion
as of the Chri&s;tian. It comes at once re|commended
by the Authority of Philo&s;ophers and
Evangeli&s;ts. And that there actually is in the
Mind of Man a &s;trong In&s;tinct and De&s;ire, an Ap|petite
and Tendency towards another and a better
State, incomparably &s;uperior to the pre&s;ent, both
in point of Happine&s;s and Duration, is no more
than every one's Experience and inward Feeling
may inform him. The Satiety and Di&s;reli&s;h at|tending
&s;en&s;ual Enjoyments, the Reli&s;h for Things
of a more pure and &s;piritual Kind, the re&s;tle&s;s Mo|tion
of the Mind, from one terrene Object or Pur|&s;uit
to another, and often a Flight or Endeavour
above them all towards &s;omething unknown, and
perfective of its Nature, are &s;o many Signs and
Tokens of this better State, which in the Stile of
the Go&s;pel is termed Life Eternal.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="211">
And as this is the greate&s;t Good that can befal
us, the very End of our Being, and that alone
which can crown and &s;atisfy our Wi&s;hes, and with|out
which we &s;hall be ever re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y; &s;o
every Man, who knows and acts up to his true In|tere&s;t,
mu&s;t make it his principal Care and Study
to obtain it: And in order to this, he mu&s;t endea|vour
to live &s;uitably to his Calling, and of con&s;e|quence
endeavour to make others obtain it too.
For how can a Chri&s;tian &s;hew him&s;elf worthy of
his Calling, otherwi&s;e than by performing the Du|ties
of it? And what Chri&s;tian Duty is more e&s;|&s;entially
&s;o, than that of Charity? And what Ob|ject
can be found upon Earth more de&s;erving our
Charity, than the Souls of Men? Or, how is it
po&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t beneficent Spirit to do them
better Service, than by promoting their be&s;t and
mo&s;t la&s;ting Intere&s;t, that is, by putting them in
the Way that leads to eternal Life.</P>
<P>What this eternal Life was, or how to come at
it, were Points unknown to the Heathen World.
It mu&s;t be owned, the wi&s;e Men of old, who fol|lowed
the Light of Nature, &s;aw even by that Light,
that the Soul of Man was deba&s;ed, and borne down|wards,
contrary to its natural Bent, by carnal and
terrene Objects; and that, on the other hand, it
was exalted, purged, and in &s;ome &s;ort a&s;&s;imulated
to the Deity, by the Contemplation of Truth and
Practice of Virtue. Thus much in general they
&s;aw or &s;urmi&s;ed. But then about the Way and
Means to know the one, or perform the other, they
were much at a lo&s;s. They were not agreed con|cerning
the true End of Mankind; which, as they
&s;aw, was mi&s;taken in the vulgar Pur&s;uits of Men;
&s;o they found it much more eafy to con&s;ute the Er|rors
of others, than to a&s;certain the Truth them|&s;elves.
Hence &s;o many Divi&s;ions and Di&s;putes
<PB N="217" REF="212">
about a Point which it mo&s;t imported them to know,
in&s;omuch as it was to give the Bias to human Life,
and govern the whole Tenor of their Actions and Conduct.</P>
<P>But when Life and Immortality were brought to
Light by the Go&s;pel, there could remain no Di&s;pute
about the chief End and Felicity of Man, no more
than there could about the Means of obtaining it,
after the expre&s;s Declaration of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord in
the Words of my Text; <HI>This is Life eternal, that
they may know thee the only true God, and Je&s;us
Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI> For the right Under|standing
of which Words we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that by
the Knowledge of God, is not meant a barren Spe|culation,
either of Philo&s;ophers or Schola&s;tic Di|vines,
nor any notional Tenets fitted to produce
Di&s;putes and Di&s;&s;en&s;ions among Men; but, on the
contrary, an holy practical Knowledge, which is
the Source, the Root, or Principle of Peace and
Union, of Faith, Hope, Charity, and univer&s;al Obe|dience.
A Man may frame the mo&s;t accurate No|tions,
and in one Sen&s;e attain the exacte&s;t Know|ledge
of God and Chri&s;t that human Faculties can
reach, and yet, notwith&s;tanding all this, be far from
knowing them in that &s;aving Sen&s;e. For St. <HI>John</HI>
tells us, that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John. iii. 6.</NOTE> <HI>who&s;oever &s;inneth, hath not &s;een Chri&s;t,
nor known him.</HI> And again,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 8.</NOTE> <HI>He that loveth not,
knoweth not God.</HI> To know God as we ought, we
mu&s;t love him; and love him &s;o as withal to love
our Brethren, his Creatures and his Children. I
&s;ay, that Knowledge of God and Chri&s;t, which is
Life eternal, implies univer&s;al Charity, with all the
Duties ingrafted thereon, or en&s;uing from thence,
that is to &s;ay, the Love of God and Man. And
our Lord expre&s;ly &s;aith,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 21.</NOTE> <HI>He that hath my Com|mandments,
<PB N="218" REF="213">
and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.</HI>
From all which it is evident, that this &s;aving Know|ledge
of God is in&s;eparable from the Knowledge
and Practice of his Will; the explicit Declaration
whereof, and of the Means to perform it, are con|tained
in the Go&s;pel, that divine In&s;trument of
Grace and Mercy to the Sons of Men. The Meta|phy&s;ical
Knowledge of God, con&s;idered in his ab|&s;olute
Nature or E&s;&s;ence, is one Thing, and to
know him as he &s;tands related to us as Creator, Re|deemer,
and Sanctifier, is another. The former
Kind of Knowledge (whatever it amounts to) hath
been, and may be, in Gentiles as well as Chri&s;|tians,
but not the latter, which is Life eternal.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, it is a plain Con&s;e|quence,
that whoever is a &s;incere Chri&s;tian cannot
be indifferent about bringing over other Men to
the Knowledge of God and Chri&s;t; but that every
one of us, who hath any Claim to that Title, is
indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged in Duty to God, and in Cha|rity
to his Neighbour, to de&s;ire and promote, &s;o
far as there is Opportunity, the Conver&s;ion of Hea|thens
and Infidels, that &s;o they may become Par|takers
of Life and Immortality. For, <HI>this is Life
eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Je&s;us
Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>In my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e upon which Words; I
&s;hall,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, con&s;ider in general the Obligation that
Chri&s;tians lie under, of bringing other Men to
the Knowledge of the only true God, and of
Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And,</P>
<P>Secondly, I &s;hall con&s;ider it in reference to
this laudable Society, in&s;tituted for the Pro|pagation
of the Go&s;pel. And under each
Head; I propo&s;e to obviate &s;uch Difficulties
as may &s;eem to retard, and intermix &s;uch Re|marks
<PB N="219" REF="214">
as &s;hall appear proper to forward &s;o
good a Work.</P>
<P>Now although it be very evident, that we can
really have neither a ju&s;t Zeal for the Glory of
God, nor a beneficent Love of Man, without wi&s;h|ing
and endeavouring, as occa&s;ion &s;erves, to &s;pread
the glad Tidings of Salvation, and bring tho&s;e who
are benighted in the Shadow of Death, to Life eter|nal,
by the Knowledge of the only true God, and
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent. Yet this
Duty, plain and undoubted as it &s;eems, happens
to be too often overlooked, even by tho&s;e who&s;e
Attention to other Points would make one think
their Neglect of this, not an Effect of lukewarm
Indifference, &s;o much as of certain mi&s;taken Noti|ons
and Suppo&s;itions. Two principal Con&s;idera|tions
occur, which, in this particular, &s;eem to have
&s;lackened the Indu&s;try of &s;ome, otherwi&s;e zealous
and &s;erious Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>One I apprehend to be this, that it is &s;urmi&s;ed,
the Chri&s;tian Religion is in a declining State, which
by many Symptoms &s;eems likely to end either in Po|pery,
or a general Infidelity. And that of cour&s;e
a prudent Per&s;on has nothing to do, but to make
&s;ure of his own Salvation, and to acquie&s;ce in the
general Tendency of Things, without being at any
fruitle&s;s Pains to oppo&s;e what cannot be prevented,
to &s;teer again&s;t the Stream, or re&s;i&s;t a Torrent,
which as it flows, gathers Strength and Rapidity,
and in the End will be &s;ure to overflow, and carry
before it. When a Man of a de&s;ponding and
foreboding Spirit hath been led, by his Ob&s;ervation
of the Ways of the World, and the prevailing Hu|mour
of our Times, to think after this Manner; he
will be inclined to &s;trengthen this his preconceived
Opinion, as is u&s;ual in other the like Ca&s;es, by Mi&s;-application
of holy Scripture: For In&s;tance, by
<PB N="220" REF="215">
tho&s;e Words of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xviii. 8.</NOTE> <HI>When
the Son of Man cometh, &s;hall he find Faith on the
Earth?</HI> which have been applied to this very Pur|po&s;e,
as importing that before the final Judgment,
Chri&s;tian Faith &s;hould be extingui&s;hed upon Earth;
although the&s;e Words do, from the Context, &s;eem
plainly to refer to the De&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and
the ob&s;tinate Blindne&s;s of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who even then
when they felt the Hand of God, &s;hould not ac|knowledge
it, or believe the <HI>Roman</HI> Army to be
the In&s;trument of divine Vengeance, in the Day of
their Vi&s;itation, by him whom they had injuriou&s;ly
treated, rejected, and put to Death.</P>
<P>But, granting the former Sen&s;e might be &s;up|ported
by no ab&s;urd Hypothe&s;is, or no improbable
Gue&s;s; yet &s;hall the Endeavours of Chri&s;tian Men
for propagating the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t be fore&s;talled
by any Suppo&s;itions or Conjectures what&s;oever?
Admitting, I &s;ay, tho&s;e Words regard the future
Advent of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, yet can any one tell how
near or how far off that Advent may be? Are
not the Times and Sea&s;ons foreknown only to God?
And &s;hall we neglect a certain Duty to Day, upon
an uncertain Surmi&s;e of what is to come hereafter?
This Way of thinking might furni&s;h as &s;trong
Rea&s;ons again&s;t Preaching at home, as abroad,
within, as without the Pale of the Church. It
would be as &s;pecious an Argument again&s;t the one as
the other, but in reality can conclude again&s;t neither.
For, as we know not when that &s;uppo&s;ed Time of
general Infidelity is to be, or whether it will be at
all; &s;o, if it were ever &s;o &s;ure, and ever &s;o near, it
would neverthele&s;s become us to take care, that it
may not be an Effect of our own particular Indif|ference
and Neglect.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="216">
But if we take our Notions, not from the uncer|tain
Interpretation of a particular Text, but from
the whole Tenor of the divine Oracles, from the
expre&s;s Promi&s;e and reiterated Predictions of our
ble&s;&s;ed Lord and his Apo&s;tles, we &s;hall believe,
that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. ii. 9, 10, 11.</NOTE> <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t is highly exalted of God, to the
End; that at his Name every Knee &s;hall bow, and

of God the Father.</HI> That<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 25.</NOTE> <HI>he mu&s;t reign till he hath
put all Enemies under his Feet.</HI> That<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxviii. 20.</NOTE> <HI>he is with us
alway, even unto the End of the World.</HI> And that,
the Church of the living God, the Pillar and Ground
of Truth, is &s;o far from being de&s;troyed by human
Means,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xvi. 28.</NOTE> <HI>that the Gates of Hell</HI> (all the infernal
Powers) <HI>&s;hall not prevail again&s;t it.</HI> Let us there|fore
bani&s;h all &s;uch Conceits as may &s;eem to ju&s;tify
our Indolence, as may rea&s;on us out of all Courage
and Vigour in the Race that is &s;et before us; let us
not, I &s;ay, &s;lacken our own Hands, nor enfeeble
our own Knees, by preconceived Fancies and Sup|po&s;itions,
con&s;idering that as the Succe&s;s of all En|terpri&s;es
in great mea&s;ure depends on the Spirit of
the Undertakers, &s;o nothing is more apt to rai&s;e a
Spirit than Hope; nor to depre&s;s it, than De&s;pon|dency.
We ought therefore to &s;hake off every
vain Fear in our &s;piritual Warfare. The Number,
the Pre&s;umption, and the Abilities of tho&s;e, who
take Coun&s;el together again&s;t the Lord and again&s;t
his Anointed, &s;hould not di&s;hearten, but rather ex|cite
and encourage us to &s;tand in the Gap.</P>
<P>Another Con&s;ideration, that may po&s;&s;ibly with|hold
divers &s;incere Believers from contributing their
Endeavours for bringing Men to the Knowledge of
God and Chri&s;t, and thereby to eternal Life, is the
want of Miracles in the pre&s;ent Age. Men natu|rally
<PB N="222" REF="217">
ca&s;t about for Rea&s;ons to countenance the Part
they take. And as the Gift of Miracles was of
mighty Influence and Help to tho&s;e, who were
commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;pread abroad the Light of the
Go&s;pel in its fir&s;t Promulgation, &s;o no Pretence of|fers
it&s;elf more naturally to excu&s;e a Man from exe|cuting
any Purpo&s;e, than the Want of Authority,
which, in the Opinion of Men, cannot be without
a ju&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion, nor this unle&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed
by tho&s;e proper Means and Powers that have been
known to attend it. Now, with regard to this
Defect of Miracles, I &s;hall beg leave to make two
Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is to be ob&s;erved, that if we have not
Miracles, we have other Advantages which make
them le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary now, than in the fir&s;t &s;preading
of the Go&s;pel: Whole Nations have found the Be|nefit
of Chri&s;t's Religion, it is protected by Princes,
e&s;tabli&s;hed and encouraged by Laws, &s;upported by
Learning and Arts, recommended by the Experience
of many Ages, as well as by the Authority and
Example of the wi&s;e&s;t it and mo&s;t knowing Men.
Certainly, if the greate&s;t Part of Mankind are Gen|tiles
or Mahometans, it cannot be denied, that the
mo&s;t knowing, mo&s;t learned, and mo&s;t improved
Nations, profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity; and that even the
Mahometans them&s;elves bear Te&s;timony to the di|vine
Mi&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Whereas therefore,
in the Beginning, a few illiterate Wanderers, of
the meane&s;t of the People, had the Prejudices, the
Learning, and the Power of their own, as well as
other Nations, in one World, the whole World, to
oppo&s;e and overcome: Tho&s;e who at this Day
engage in the Propagation of the Go&s;pel, do it up|on
Terms in many Re&s;pects far more ea&s;y and ad|vantageous.
It is Power again&s;t Weakne&s;s, Civili|ty
again&s;t Barbari&s;m, Knowledge again&s;t Ignorance,
<PB N="223" REF="218">
&s;ome or other, if not all the&s;e Advantages, in the
pre&s;ent Times, attending the Progre&s;s of the Chri&s;|tian
Religion, in whatever Part of the World Men
&s;hall attempt to plant it.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd Place we may reflect, that if we
have not the Gift of Miracles, this is a good Rea|&s;on
why we &s;hould exert more &s;trongly tho&s;e human
Means which God hath put in our Power; and make
our ordinary Faculties, whether of the Head, or the
Hand, or the Tongue, our Intere&s;t, our Credit, or our
Fortune, &s;ub&s;ervient to the great Giver of them;
and chearfully contribute our humble Mite towards
ha&s;tening that Time, wherein<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxxxvi. 9.</NOTE><HI>all Nations whom
thou ha&s;t made, &s;hall come and wor&s;hip before thee, O
Lord, and &s;hall glorify thy Name.</HI> It is at lea&s;t
a plain Ca&s;e, that the Want of Apo&s;tolical Gifts
&s;hould not be pleaded as a Bar to our doing that,
which in no Re&s;pect, either of Difficulty or Danger,
equals, or approaches the Apo&s;tolical Office. What
Pretence can this &s;upply for Mens being quite uncon|cerned
about the Spreading of the Go&s;pel, or the
Salvation of Souls? for Mens forgetting that they
are Chri&s;tians, and related to human Kind? How
can this ju&s;tify their overlooking Opportunities
which lie in their Way, their not contributing
a &s;mall Part of their Fortune towards forwarding a
De&s;ign, wherein they &s;hare neither Pains nor Pe|ril;
the not be&s;towing on it, even the cheap A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of their Speech, Attention, Coun&s;el, or
Countenance, as Occa&s;ion offers? How unlike is
this worldly, &s;elfi&s;h Indifference, to that Account
which St. <HI>Paul</HI> gives of him&s;elf, that<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. x. 33.</NOTE> <HI>he &s;ought
not his own Profit, but the Profit of many, that they
may be &s;aved.</HI> And yet herein he expected the <HI>Co|rinthians</HI>
(and the &s;ame Rea&s;on will hold for us)
<PB N="224" REF="219">
&s;hould be like him; for he &s;ubjoins, <HI>Be ye Followers
of me as I al&s;o am of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Having con&s;idered the Duty in general, I come
now to treat of it with reference to <HI>America,</HI> the
peculiar Province of this venerable Society; which
I &s;uppo&s;e well informed of the State and Progre&s;s
of Religion in that Part of the World, by their
Corre&s;pondencies with the Clergy upon their Mi&s;|&s;ion.
It may neverthele&s;s be expected that one who
had been engaged in a De&s;ign upon this very View,
who hath been upon the Place, and re&s;ided a con&s;i|derable
Time in one of our Colonies, &s;ould have
ob&s;erved &s;omewhat worth reporting. It is to be
hoped, therefore, that one Part of my Audience will
pardon, what the other may perhaps expect, while
I detain them with the Narrative of a few Things
I have ob&s;erved, and &s;uch Reflexions as thereupon
&s;ugge&s;ted them&s;elves; &s;ome Part of which may po&s;|&s;ibly be found to extend to ether Colonies.</P>
<P><HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> with a Portion of the adjacent
Continent, under the &s;ame Government, is inha|bited
by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colony, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly
of Sectaries of many different Denominations, who &s;eem
to have worn off part of that Prejudice, which they
inherited from their Ance&s;tors, again&s;t the national
Church of this Land; though it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged
at the &s;ame Time, that too many of them
have worn off a &s;erious Sen&s;e of all Religion. Se|veral
indeed of the better Sort are accu&s;tomed to
a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves regularly on the Lord's Day
for the Performance of divine Wor&s;hip. But mo&s;t
of tho&s;e, who are di&s;per&s;ed throughout this Colony,
&s;eem to rival &s;ome well-bred People of other Coun|tries,
in a thorough Indifference for all that is &s;|acred,
being equally carele&s;s of outward Wor&s;hip,
and of inward Principles, whether of Faith or
Practice. Of the Bulk of them it may certainly
<PB N="225" REF="220">
be &s;aid, that they live without the Sacraments, not
being &s;o much as baptized: And as for their Morals,
I apprehend there is nothing to be found in them
that &s;hould tempt others to make an Experiment of
their Principles, either in Religion or Government.
But it mu&s;t be owned; the general Behaviour of the
Inhabitants in tho&s;e Towns where Churches and
Meetings have been long &s;ettled, and regularly at|tended,
&s;eems &s;o much better, as &s;ufficiently to &s;hew
the Difference, which a &s;olemn regular Wor&s;hip of
God makes between Per&s;ons of the &s;ame Blood,
Temper, and natural Faculties.</P>
<P>The native <HI>Indians,</HI> who are &s;aid to have been
formerly many Thou&s;ands, within the Compa&s;s of
this Colony, do not at pre&s;ent amount to one
Thou&s;and, including every Age and Sex. And
the&s;e are either all Servants or Labourers for the
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who have contributed more to de&s;troy
their Bodies by the U&s;e of &s;trong Liquors, than by
any means to improve their Minds, or &s;ave their
Souls. This &s;low Poi&s;on, jointly operating with
the Small-Pox, and their Wars (but much more
de&s;tructive than both) hath con&s;umed the <HI>Indians,</HI>
not only in our Colonies, but al&s;o far and wide upon
our Con&s;ines. And having made Havock of them,
is now doing the &s;ame thing by tho&s;e who taught
them that odious Vice.</P>
<P>The Negroes in the Government of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI>
are about half as many more than the <HI>Indians;</HI> and
both together &s;carce amount to a &s;eventh Part of
the whole Colony. The Religion of the&s;e People,
as is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, takes after that of their
Ma&s;ters. Some few are baptized; &s;everal frequent
the different A&s;&s;emblies; and far the greater Part
none at all. An ancient Antipathy to the <HI>Indians,</HI>
whom it &s;eems, our fir&s;t Planters (therein as in cer|tain
other Particulars affecting to imitate <HI>Jews</HI> rather
<PB N="226" REF="221">
than <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>) imagined they had a Right to treat
on the Foot of <HI>Canaanites</HI> or <HI>Amalekites,</HI> together
with an irrational Contempt of the Blacks, as
Creatures of another Species, who had no Right to
be in&s;truced or admitted to the Sacraments, have
proved a main Ob&s;tacle to the Conver&s;ion of the&s;e
poor People.</P>
<P>To this may be added, an erroneous Notion,
that the being baptized, is incon&s;i&s;tent with a State
of Slavery. To undeceive them in this Particular,
which had too much Weight, it &s;eemed a proper
Step, if the Opinion of his Maje&s;ty's Attorney and
Solicitor-General could be procured. This Opi|nion
they charitably &s;ent over, &s;igned with their
own Hands; which was accordingly printed in
<HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> and di&s;per&s;ed throughout the Plan|tations.
I heartily wi&s;h it may produce the intend|ed
Effect. It mu&s;t be owned, our reformed Planters,
with re&s;pect to the Natives and the Slaves, might
learn from tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> how it is
their Intere&s;t and Duty to behave. Both <HI>French</HI>
and <HI>Spaniards</HI> have intermarried with <HI>Indians,</HI> to
the great Strength, Security and Increa&s;e of their
Colonies. They take care to in&s;truct both them
and their Negroes, in the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Religion, to the
Reproach of tho&s;e who profe&s;s a better. They
have al&s;o Bi&s;hops and Seminaries for Clergy; and
it is not found that their Colonies are wor&s;e Sub|jects,
or depend le&s;s on their Mother Country, on
that Account.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem, that the likelie&s;t Step towards
converting the Heathen would be to begin with the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Planters; who&s;e Influence will for ever be
an Ob&s;tacle to propagating the Go&s;pel, till they
have a right Sen&s;e of it them&s;elves, which would
&s;hew them how much it is their Duty to impart it
to others. The Mi&s;&s;ionaries employed by this
<PB N="227" REF="222">
venerable Society have done, and continue to do,
good Service, in bringing tho&s;e Planters to a &s;erious
Sen&s;e of Religion, which, it is hoped, will in Time
extend to others. I &s;peak it knowingly, that the
Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, in tho&s;e Provinces which
go by the Name of <HI>New-England,</HI> &s;ent and &s;up|ported
at the Expence of this Society, have, by their Sobriety of Manners, di&s;creet Behaviour, and
a competent Degree of u&s;eful Knowledge, &s;hewn
them&s;elves worthy the Choice of tho&s;e who &s;ent
them; and particularly in living on a more friendly
Foot with their Brethren of the Separation; who,
on their Part, were al&s;o very much come off from
that Narrowne&s;s of Spirit, which formerly kept
them at &s;uch an unamicable Di&s;tance from us. And
as there is Rea&s;on to apprehend, that Part of <HI>Ame|rica</HI>
could not have been thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, and
provided with &s;uch a Number of proper Per&s;ons,
if one half of them had not been &s;upplied out of
the di&s;&s;enting Seminaries of the Country, who, in
Proportion as they attain to more liberal Improve|ments
of Learning, are ob&s;erved to quit their Pre|judice
towards an epi&s;copal Church; &s;o I verily
think it might increa&s;e the Number of &s;uch u&s;eful
Men, if Provi&s;ion were made to defray their Charges
in coming hither to receive Holy Orders; pa&s;&s;ing
and repa&s;&s;ing the Ocean, and tarrying the nece&s;&s;ary
Time in <HI>London,</HI> requiring an Expence that many
are not able to bear. It would al&s;o be an Encou|ragement
to the Mi&s;&s;ionaries in general, and pro|bably
produce good Effects, if the Allowance of
certain Mi&s;&s;ionaries were augmented, in proportion
to the Services they had done, and the Time they
had &s;pent in their Million. The&s;e Hints I venture
to &s;ugge&s;t, as not unu&s;eful in an Age, wherein all
human Encouragements are found more nece&s;&s;ary,
than at the fir&s;t Propagation of the Go&s;pel. But
<PB N="228" REF="223">
they are, with all due Deference and Re&s;pect,
&s;ubmitted to the Judgment of this venerable Au|dience.</P>
<P>After all, it is hardly to be expected, that &s;o
long as Infidelity prevails at home, the Chri&s;tian
Religion &s;hould thrive and flouri&s;h in our Colonies
abroad. Mankind, it mu&s;t be owned, left to them|&s;elves,
are &s;o much bewildered and benighted, with
re&s;pect to the Origin of that Evil which they feel,
and from which they are at a lo&s;s about the Means
of being freed; that the Doctrines of the lap&s;ed
State of Man, his Reconciliation by Chri&s;t, and
Regeneration by the Spirit, may rea&s;onably be
hoped to find an ea&s;y Admi&s;&s;ion, as bringing with
them Light and Comfort, into a Mind not hardened
by Impenitency, nor fore-clo&s;ed by Pride, nor bi|a&s;ed
by Prejudice. But &s;uch is the Vanity of Man,
that no Prejudice operates more powerfully than
that in Favour of Fa&s;hion; and no Fa&s;hions are &s;o
much followed by our Colonies, as tho&s;e of the
Mother Country, which they often adopt in their
Modes of living, to their great Inconvenience,
without allowing for the Di&s;parity of Circum&s;tance
or Climate. This &s;ame Humour hath made Infi|delity
(as I find it too credibly reported) &s;pread in
&s;ome of our wealthy Plantations; uneducated Men
being more apt to tread in the Steps of Libertines
and Men of Fa&s;hion, than to model them&s;elves by
the Laws and In&s;titutions of their Mother Country,
or the Lives and Profe&s;&s;ions of the virtuous and
religious Part of it.</P>
<P>But this is not all: While tho&s;e abroad are le&s;s
di&s;po&s;ed to receive, &s;ome at home are, perhaps,
le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to propagate the Go&s;pel, from the
&s;ame Cau&s;e. It is to be feared, I &s;ay, that the pre|vailing
Torrent of Infidelity, which &s;taggers the
Faith of &s;ome, may cool the Zeal and damp the
<PB N="229" REF="224">
Spirit of others, who, judging from the Event and
Succe&s;s of tho&s;e who impugn the Church of Chri&s;t,
may po&s;&s;ibly entertain &s;ome Scruple or Surmi&s;e,
whether it may not be, for the pre&s;ent at lea&s;t,
abandoned by Providence, and that human Care
mu&s;t ineffectually interpo&s;e, till it &s;hall plea&s;e God,
<HI>yet once more to &s;hake not the Earth only, but al&s;o the
Heavens.</HI> This Point hath been touched before,
but de&s;erves farther Con&s;ideration: to the End,
that the peculiar Impiety of a profane Age, may
not be a Bar to tho&s;e very Endeavours, which it&s;elf
renders more nece&s;&s;ary, and calls for more loudly
now than ever.</P>
<P>Whatever Men may think, the Arm of the Lord
is not &s;hortened. In all this Prevalency of Athei&s;m
and Irreligion, there is no Advantage gained by
the Powers of Darkne&s;s, either again&s;t God, or
godly Men, but only again&s;t their own wretched
Parti&s;ans. The Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation is a Di&s;|pen&s;ation
of Grace and Favour. The Chri&s;tian
Church a Society of Men intitled to this Grace, on
performing certain Conditions. If this Society is
dimini&s;hed, as tho&s;e who remain true Members of it
&s;uffer no Lo&s;s to them&s;elves, &s;o God lo&s;eth no
Right, &s;uffereth no Detriment, forgoeth no Good;
his Grace re&s;i&s;ted or unfruitful, being no more
lo&s;t to him, than the Light of the Sun &s;hining
on de&s;ert Places, or among People who &s;hut their
Eyes.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this Exce&s;s, this un&s;temmed Torrent of
Profanene&s;s, may po&s;&s;ibly, in the Conclu&s;ion, de|feat
it&s;elf, confirm what it meant to extirpate, and
in&s;tead of de&s;troying, prove a Means of pre&s;erving
our Religion; the evil Fruits and Effects thereof
being &s;o notorious and flagrant, and &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt,
as in all likelihood to be able to open the Eyes,
and rou&s;e the Attention of tho&s;e, who may be blind
<PB N="230" REF="225">
and deaf to every other Argument and Con|&s;ideration.
Or, who knows but the Chri&s;tian
Church corrupted by Pro&s;perity, is to be re&s;tored
and purified by Adver&s;ity? which may prove for
ought we can tell, as &s;alutary in future, as it hath
been in pa&s;t Ages. Many in&s;olent and pre&s;umptu|ous
Foes have &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t the Church of
God; whole Hook neverthele&s;s may be in their
No&s;trils, and his Bridle in their Lips, managing
and governing, even their Rage and Folly, to the
fulfilling of his own wi&s;e Purpo&s;es; and who may
not fail in the End, to deal by them as he did by
the King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> when he had<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. x. 12.</NOTE> <HI>performed his
Work upon</HI> Sion <HI>and upon</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>puni&s;hing their
&s;tout Heart and high Looks.</HI> This pre&s;umptuous
Conqueror was, without knowing it, a Tool or In|strument
in the Hands of that God whom he bla&s;|phemed.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. x. 5, 6, 7.</NOTE> <HI>O</HI> A&s;&s;yrian, <HI>the Rod of mine Anger! I
will &s;end him again&s;t an hypocritical Nation, and
again&s;t the People of my Wrath will I give him a
Charge to take the Spoil, and to take the Prey, and
to tread them down like the Mire of the Streets.
Howbeit he meaneth not &s;o, neither doth his Heart
think &s;o, but it is in his Heart to de&s;troy and cut off
Nations not a few.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much at lea&s;t is evident: It is no new
Thing, that great Enormities &s;hould produce great
Humiliations, and the&s;e again noble Virtues, which
have often recovered both &s;ingle Men, and whole
States, even in a natural and civil Sen&s;e. And if
the Captivities, Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and De&s;olations of the
Jewi&s;h Church, have occa&s;ioned their Return to
God, and rein&s;tated them in his Favour; nay, if it
was actually foretold, whenever they lay under the
Cur&s;e of God, at the Mercy of their Enemies,
<PB N="202" REF="226">
peeled and &s;cattered in a foreign Land, that never|thele&s;s
upon their calling his Covenant to Mind,
and returning to him,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxx. 3.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord their God would
turn their Captivity, and have Compa&s;&s;ion upon them.</HI>
I &s;ay, if Things were &s;o, why may we not in
Rea&s;on hope for &s;omething analogous thereto, in
behalf of the Chri&s;tian Church, It cannot be de|nied,
that there was a great Analogy between the
Jewi&s;h In&s;titutions, and the Doctrines of the
Go&s;pel; for In&s;tance, between the Pa&s;chal Lamb,
and the Lamb of God &s;lain from the Foundation
of the World; between the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Bondage, and
that of Sin; the earthly <HI>Canaan,</HI> and the heavenly;
the fle&s;hly Circumci&s;ion, and the &s;piritual.
In the&s;e and many other Particulars, the Analogy &s;eems &s;o
plain, that it can hardly be di&s;puted. To be con|vinced
that the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Jewi&s;h
Oeconomy were Figures and Shadows of the Evan|gelical,
we need only look into the Epi&s;tle to the
<HI>Hebrews.</HI> May we not therefore, in pur&s;uance
of this &s;ame Analogy, &s;uppo&s;e a &s;imilar Treatment
of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Church?</P>
<P>Let us then &s;ee, on what Terms the former
flood with God, in order to di&s;cover what the latter
may rea&s;onably expect. The &s;olemn Denunciation
to the <HI>Jews</HI> was,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut, xxviii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>If thou &s;hall hearken diligently
unto the Voice of the Lord thy God, to ob&s;erve and
to do all his Commandments, which I command thee

Di&s;obedience, it is added among many other
Threats and Maledictions:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 22, 23.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord &s;hall &s;mite
thee with Bla&s;ting and with Mildew: and thy Heaven

this Land drawn down upon it, by more Ways
than one, the ju&s;t Judgments of Heaven? Surely
we have felt in a Metaphor the fir&s;t of the fore|mentioned
Judgments; and the la&s;t hath been
literally fulfilled upon us. Is it not vi&s;ible that we
are le&s;s knowing, le&s;s virtuous, le&s;s rea&s;onable, in
Proportion as we are le&s;s religious? Are we not
grown drunk and giddy with Vice and Vanity and
Pre&s;umption, and Free-thinking, and Extravagance
of every Kind? to a Degree that we may truly be
&s;aid to be <HI>&s;mitten with Madne&s;s, and Blindne&s;s, and
A&s;toni&s;hment of Heart.</HI></P>
<P>As anciently mo&s;t unchri&s;tian Schi&s;ms and Di&s;|putes,
joined with great Corruption of Manners,
made way for the <HI>Mahometan</HI> in the Ea&s;t, and the
Papal Dominion in the We&s;t; even &s;o here at home
in the la&s;t Century, a weak Reliance upon human
Politics and Power on the one hand, and enthu&s;i|a&s;tic
Rage on the other, together with Carnal|mindedne&s;s
on both, gave occa&s;ion to introduce
Athei&s;m and Infidelity. If the temporal State,
and outward Form of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church was, upon
their Defection, overturned by Invaders; in like
manner, when Chri&s;tians are no longer governed
by the Light of Evangelical Truth, when we re&s;i&s;t
the Spirit of God, are we not to expect, that
<HI>the Heaven above will be as Bra&s;s,</HI> that the divine Grace
will no longer &s;hower down on our obdurate Hearts,
that our Church and Profe&s;&s;ion will be bla&s;ted by
licentious Scorners, tho&s;e Madmen, who in Sport
<HI>&s;catter Firebrands, Arrows, and Death?</HI> As all this
is no more than we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e will
en&s;ue upon our Back&s;liding, &s;o we may, with equal
Rea&s;on, hope it will be remedied upon our Return
to God.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="228">
From what hath been &s;aid it follows, that in
order to propagate the Go&s;pel abroad, it is nece&s;&s;ary
we do it at home, and extend our Charity to do|me&s;tic
Infidels, if we would convert or prevent
foreign ones. So that a View of the declining
State of Religion here at home, of tho&s;e Things
that produced this Declen&s;ion, and of the proper
Methods to repair it, is naturally connected with
the Subject of this Di&s;cour&s;e. I &s;hall therefore beg
your Patience, while I ju&s;t mention a few Remarks
or Hints, too obvious, perhaps, in them&s;elves
to be new or unknown to any pre&s;ent, but too little
vi&s;ible in their Effects, to make one think they are,
by all, much attended to.</P>
<P>Some, preferring Points notional or ritual to the
Love of God and Man, con&s;ider the national
Church only as it &s;tands oppo&s;ed to other Chri&s;tian
Societies. The&s;e generally have a Zeal without
Knowledge, and the Effects are &s;uitable to the
Cau&s;e; they really hurt what they &s;eem to e&s;pou&s;e.
Others more &s;olicitous about the Di&s;covery of
Truth, than the Practice of Holine&s;s, employ
them&s;elves, rather to &s;py out Errors in the Church,
than enforce its Precepts. The&s;e, it is to be feared,
po&s;tpone the great Intere&s;ts of Religion to Points
of le&s;s Concern, in any Eyes but their own. But
&s;urely they would do well to con&s;ider, that an
humble, though confu&s;ed or indi&s;tinct, Faith in the
Bond of Charity, and productive of good Works,
is much more Evangelical than any accurate di&s;put|ing
and conceited Knowledge.</P>
<P>A Church which contains the Fundamentals, and
nothing &s;ubver&s;ive of tho&s;e Fundamentals, is not to
be &s;et at naught by any particular Member; be|cau&s;e
it may not, in every Point, perhaps, cor|re&s;pond
with his Ideas, no not, though he is &s;ure
of being in the right. Probably there never was,
<PB N="234" REF="229">
or will be, an e&s;tabli&s;hed Church in this World,
without vi&s;ible Marks of Humanity upon it. Saint
<HI>Paul</HI> &s;uppo&s;eth, that<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iii. 12.</NOTE> <HI>on the Foundation of Je&s;us
Chri&s;t, there will be human Super&s;tructures of Hay
and Stubble,</HI> Things light and trivial, wrong or
&s;uper&s;titious, which indeed is a natural Con&s;equence
of the Weakne&s;s and Ignorance of Man. But
where that living Foundation is rightly laid in the
Mind, there will not fail to grow and &s;pring from
thence tho&s;e Virtues and Graces, which are the ge|nuine
Effects and Tokens of true Faith, and which
are by no means incon&s;i&s;tent with every Error in
Theory, or every needle&s;s Rite in Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian Religion was calculated for the
Bulk of Mankind, and therefore cannot rea&s;onably
be &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t in &s;ubtle and nice Notions.
From the Time that Divinity was con&s;idered as a
Science, and human Rea&s;on inthroned in the Sanc|tuary
of God, the Hearts of its Profe&s;&s;ors &s;eem to
have been le&s;s under the Influence of Grace. From
that Time have grown many unchri&s;tian Di&s;&s;en|&s;ions
and Controver&s;ies, of Men<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>knowing nothing,
but doting about Que&s;tions and Strifes of Words,
whereof cometh Envy, Strife, Railings, evil Sur|mi&s;es,
perver&s;e Di&s;putings of Men of corrupt Minds
and de&s;titute of Truth.</HI> Doubtle&s;s, the making Re|ligion
a notional Thing, hath been of infinite Di&s;|&s;ervice.
And whereas its holy My&s;teries are rather
to be received with Humility of Faith, than
de|fined and mea&s;ured by the Accuracy of human
Rea&s;on; all Attempts of this Kind, however well
intended, have vi&s;ibly failed in the Event; and
in&s;tead of reconciling Infidels, have, by creating
Di&s;putes and Heats among the Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;|tianity,
given no &s;mall Advantage to its Enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="230">
To conclude, if we proportioned our Zeal to the
Importance of Things: If we could love Men
who&s;e Opinions we do not approve: If we knew
the World more, and liked it le&s;s: If we had a
due Sen&s;e of the divine Perfection and our own
Defects: If our chief Study was the Wi&s;dom from
above, de&s;cribed by St. <HI>Paul:</HI> And if, in order
to all this, that were done in Places of Education,
which cannot &s;o well be done out of them: I &s;ay,
if the&s;e Steps were taken at home, while proper
Mea&s;ures are carrying on abroad, the one would
very much forward or facilitate the other. As it is
not meant, &s;o it mu&s;t not be under&s;tood, that
foreign Attempts &s;hould wait for dome&s;tic Succe&s;s,
but only that it is to be wi&s;hed they may co-operate.
Certainly if a ju&s;t and rational, a genuine and &s;incere,
a warm and vigorous Piety, animated the Mother-Country,
the Influence thereof would &s;oon reach
our foreign Plantations, and extend throughout
their Borders. We &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee Religion &s;hine
forth with new Lu&s;tre and Force, to the Conver&s;ion
of Infidels, both at home and abroad, and to

Corpus autem iners &amp; quietum nihil agit, ergo nec

nihil aliud e&s;t quam continuatio in eodem modo
exi&s;tendi, quae propri&egrave; dici actio non pote&s;t.
Caeter&ugrave;m re&s;i&s;tentiam, quam experimur in &s;i&s;tendo

diver&s;imod&egrave; explicari pote&s;t.</P>
<P>68. Statuamus motum novum in corpore per|cu&s;&s;o
con&s;ervari, &s;ive per vim in&s;itam, qua corpus
quodlibet per&s;everat in &s;tatu &s;uo, vel motus, vel
quietis uniformis in directum: &s;ive per vim im|pre&s;&s;am,
durante percu&s;&s;ione in corpus percu&s;&s;um
receptam ibidemque permanentem, idem erit quoad
rem, differentia exi&s;tente in nominibus tant&ugrave;m.
Similiter, ubi mobile percutiens perdit, &amp; percu&s;|&s;um
acquirit motum, parum refert di&s;putate, utrum
motus acqui&s;itus &s;it idem numero cum motu per|dito,
ducit enim in minutias metaphy&s;icas, &amp;
pror&s;us nominales de identitate. Itaque &s;ive di|camus
motum tran&s;ire &agrave; percutiente in percu&s;&s;um,
&s;ive in percu&s;&s;o motum de novo generari, de&s;trui
autem in percutiente, res eodem recidit. Utro|bique
intelligitur unum corpus motum perdere, al|terum
acquirere, &amp; praeterea nihil.</P>
<P>69. Mentem, quae agitat &amp; continet univer&s;am

negaverim. In philo&s;ophi&acirc; tamen phy&s;ic&acirc;, cau&s;as
&amp; &s;olutiones phaenomen&ocirc;n &agrave; principiis mechanicis
petere oportet. Phy&s;ic&egrave; igitur res explicatur non
a&s;&s;ignando ejus cau&s;am ver&egrave; agentem &amp; incorpo|ream,
&s;ed demon&s;trando ejus connexionem cum
principiis mechanicis: cuju&s;modi e&s;t illud, <HI>actio|nem
&amp; reactionem e&s;&s;e &s;emper contrarias &amp; aequales,</HI> &agrave;
quo, tanquam fonte &amp; principio primario, eruuntur
regulae de motuum communicatione, quae &agrave; neo|tericis,
magno &s;cientiarum bono, jam ante repertae
&s;unt &amp; demon&s;tratae.</P>
<P>70. Nobis &s;atis fuerit, &s;i innuamus principium
illud alio modo declarari potui&s;&s;e. Nam &s;i vera
rerum natura, potius quam ab&s;tracta mathe&s;is &s;pec|tetur,
videbitur rectius dici, in attractione vel
percu&s;&s;ione pa&s;&s;ionem corporum, quam actionem,
e&s;&s;e utrobique aequalem. Exempli gratia, lapis
fune equo alligatus tantum trahitur ver&s;us equum,
quantum equus ver&s;us lapidem: corpus etiam mo|tum
in aliud quie&s;cens impactum, patitur eandem
mutationem cum corpore quie&s;cente. Et quoad
effectum realem, percutiens e&s;t item percu&s;&s;um,
percu&s;&s;umque percutiens. Mutatio autem illa e&s;t
utrobique, tam in corpore equi quam in lapide,
tam in moto quam in quie&s;cente, pa&s;&s;io mera.
E&s;&s;e autem vim, virtutem, aut actionem corpoream
talium effectuum ver&egrave; &amp; propri&egrave; cau&s;atricem non
con&s;tat. Corpus motum in quie&s;cens impingitur,
loquimur tamen activ&egrave;, dicentes illud hoc impel|lere:
nec ab&s;urd&egrave; in mechanicis, ubi ideae mathe|maticae
potius quam verae rerum naturae &s;pectantur.</P>
<P>71. In phy&s;ica, &s;en&s;us &amp; experientia, quae ad
effectus apparentes &s;olummodo pertingunt, locum
habent; in mechanica, notiones ab&s;tractae mathe|maticorum
admittuntur. In philo&s;ophia prima &s;eu
metaphy&s;ica agitur de rebus incorporeis, de cau&s;is,
veritate, &amp; exi&s;tentia rerum. Phy&s;icus &s;eries &s;ive
<PB N="267" REF="260">
&s;ucce&s;&s;iones rerum &s;en&s;ibilium contemplatur, qui|bus
legibus connectuntur, &amp; quo ordine, quid
praecedit tanquam cau&s;a, quid &s;equitur tanquam
effectus animadvertens. Atque hac ratione dici|mus
corpus motum e&s;&s;e cau&s;am mot&ucirc;s in altero,
vel ei motum imprimere, trahere etiam, aut im|pellere.
Quo &s;en&s;u cau&s;ae &s;ecundae corporeae in|telligi
debent, null&acirc; ratione habit&agrave; verae &s;edis virium,
vel potentiarum actricum, aut cau&s;ae realis cui in&s;unt.
Porro, dici po&s;&s;unt cau&s;ae vel principia mechanica,
ultra corpus, figuram, motum, etiam axiomata
&s;cientiae mechanicae primaria, tanquam cau&s;ae
