<HEAD>For the Encouragement of &s;o u&s;eful a Work, it is
thought fit the Publick &s;hould be inform'd of
the Contents of the First Volume, by one who
has with great Care perus'd the <HI>Manu&s;cript.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Author, in his Preface, makes
&s;ome very judicious Reflexions upon
the Original of Arts and Sciences; That at
fir&s;t they con&s;i&s;t of &s;catter'd Theorems and
Practices, which are handed about among&s;t
the Ma&s;ters, and only reveal'd to the <HI>Filii
Artis,</HI> till &s;uch time as &s;ome great Genius
appears, who Collects the&s;e disjointed Propo|&s;itions,
and reduces them into a regular Sy|&s;tem.
That this is the Ca&s;e of that Noble
and U&s;eful Art of <HI>Political Lying,</HI> which in
this la&s;t Age having been enrich'd with &s;e|veral
new Di&s;coveries, ought not to lie any
longer in Rubbi&s;h and Confu&s;ion, but may
ju&s;tly claim a Place in the <HI>Encyclopedia,</HI> e&s;pe|cially
&s;uch as &s;erves for a Model of Educati|on
for an able Politcian; that he propo&s;es to
him&s;elf no &s;mall Stock of Fame in future Ages,
in being the fir&s;t who has undertaken this
De&s;ign; and for the &s;ame Rea&s;on he hopes
the Imperfection of his Work will be excu&s;ed.
He invites all Per&s;ons who have any Talent
that way, or any new Di&s;covery, to commu|nicate
their Thoughts, a&s;&s;uring them that
honorable mention &s;hall be made of them in

<HEAD>The First Volume con&s;i&s;ts of Eleven Chapters.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>In the fir&s;t Chapter of his excellent Trea|ti&s;e,
he rea&s;ons Philo&s;ophically concerning the
Nature of the Soul of Man, and tho&s;e Qua|lities
which render it &s;u&s;ceptible of Lyes. He
&s;uppo&s;es the Soul to be of the Nature of a
<HI>Plano-Cylindrical Speculum,</HI> or Looking-gla&s;s;
that the plain &s;ide was made by God Almigh|ty,
but that the Devil afterwards wrought
the other &s;ide into a Cylindrical Figure. The
plain &s;ide repre&s;ents Objects ju&s;t as they are,
and the Cylindrical &s;ide, by the Rules of
Catoptricks, mu&s;t needs repre&s;ent true Objects
fal&s;e, and fal&s;e Objects true; but the Cylin|drical
&s;ide being much the larger Surface,
takes in a greater Compa&s;s of vi&s;ual Rays.
That upon the Cylindrical &s;ide of the Soul
of Man depends the whole Art and Succe&s;s
of <HI>Political Lying.</HI> The Author, in this Chap|ter,
proceeds to rea&s;on upon the other Qua|lities
of the Mind; As, great Fondne&s;s of the
<HI>Malicious</HI> and the <HI>Miraculous:</HI> The Tendency
of the Soul towards the <HI>Malicious,</HI> &s;prings
from Self-love, or a Plea&s;ure to find Man|kind
more wicked, ba&s;e, or unfortunate, than
our &s;elves. The De&s;ign of the <HI>Miraculous,</HI>
proceeds from the Inactivity of the Soul, or
its Incapacity to be moved or delighted with
any thing that is vulgar or common. The
Author having e&s;tabli&s;h'd the Qualities of the
<PB N="8" REF="6">
MIND, upon which his Art is founded, he
proceeds,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>In his Second Chapter, to Treat of the
Nature of <HI>Political Lying</HI>; which he defines,
to be, <HI>The Art of convincing the People of</HI> Salu|tary
Fal&s;hoods, <HI>for &s;ome good End.</HI> He calls it
an <HI>Art</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from that of telling
Truth, which does not &s;eem to want <HI>Art</HI>;
but then he would have this under&s;tood on|ly
as to the Invention, becau&s;e there is indeed
more Art nece&s;&s;ary to convince the People
of a <HI>Salutary</HI> Truth, than a <HI>Salutary</HI> Fal&s;hood.
Then he proceeds to prove, that there are
<HI>Salutary</HI> Fal&s;hoods, of which he gives a great
many In&s;tances both before and after the
Revolution; and demon&s;trates plainly, that
we could not have carried, on the War &s;o
long, without &s;everal of tho&s;e <HI>Salutary</HI> Fal&s;|hoods.
He gives Rules to calculate the Va|lue
of a <HI>Political Lye,</HI> in Pounds, Shillings,
and Pence. By <HI>Good,</HI> he does not mean that
which is ab&s;olutely &s;o, but what appears &s;o
to the Arti&s;t, which is a &s;ufficient Ground
for him to proceed upon; and. he di&s;tingui&s;hes
the Good, as it commonly, is, into <HI>Bonum
utile, dulce, &amp; hone&s;tum.</HI> He &s;hews you, that
there are <HI>Political Lyes</HI> of a mix'd Nature,
which include all the <HI>Three</HI> in different re&s;pects&punc;
That the <HI>Utile</HI> reigns generally about the
<HI>Exchange,</HI> the <HI>Dulce</HI> and <HI>Hone&s;tum</HI> at the <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI> End of the Town. One Man &s;preads
<PB N="9" REF="7">
a Lye to &s;ell or Buy Stock to greater Advan|tage;
a &s;econd, becau&s;e it is honorable to
&s;erve his Party; and a third, becau&s;e it is
&s;weet to gratify his Revenge. Having ex|plain'd
the &s;everal Terms of his Definition,
he proceeds,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>In his Third Chapter, to treat of the Law|fulne&s;s
of <HI>Political Lying</HI>; which he deduces
from its true and genuine Principles, by en|quiring
into the &s;everal Rights that Man|kind
have to Truth. He &s;hews, that the
People have a Right to private Truth from
their Neighbours, and oeconomical Truth
from their own Family; that they &s;hould
not be abu&s;ed by their Wives, Children, and
Servants; but, that they have no Right at
all to <HI>Political</HI> Truth: That the People may
as well all pretend to be Lords of Mannors
and po&s;&s;e&s;s great E&s;tates, as to have Truth
told them in Matters of Government. The
Author, with great Judgment, &s;tates the &s;e|veral
Shares of Mankind in this Matter of
Truth, according to their &s;everal Capacities,
Dignities, and Profe&s;&s;ions; and &s;hews you,
that Children have hardly any &s;hare at all; in
con&s;equence of which, they have very &s;eldom
any Truth told them. It mu&s;t be own'd,
that the Author, in this Chapter, has &s;ome
&s;eeming Difficulties to an&s;wer and explain
Texts of Scripture, and a Sermon lately
Preach'd before Her Maje&s;ty at <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="10" REF="8">
<P>The Fourth Chapter is wholly employed
in this Que&s;ton, <HI>Whether the Right of Coinage
of Political Lyes be wholly in the Government?</HI>
The Author, who is a true Friend to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Liberty, determines in the Negative, and
an&s;wers all the Arguments of the oppo&s;ite
Party with great Acutene&s;s; That as the Go|vernment
of <HI>England</HI> has a Mixture of De|mocratical
in it, &s;o the Right of Inventing
and Spreading <HI>Political Lyes,</HI> is partly in the
People; and their ob&s;tinate Adherence to this
ju&s;t Privilege has been mo&s;t con&s;picuous, and
&s;hin'd with great Lu&s;tre of late Years: That
it happens very often, that there is no other
Means left to the good People of <HI>England</HI>
to pull down a Mini&s;try and Government
they are weary of, but by exerci&s;ing this
their undoubted Right: That abundance of
<HI>Political Lying</HI> is a &s;ure &s;ign of true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Liberty: That as Mini&s;ters do &s;ometimes
u&s;e Tools to &s;upport their Power, it is but
rea&s;onable that the People &s;hould employ the
&s;ame Weapon to defend them&s;elves, and pull
them down.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>In his Fifth Chapter, he divides <HI>Political
Lyes</HI> into their &s;everal Species and Cla&s;&s;es,
and gives Precepts about the Inventing,
Spreading, and Propagating the &s;everal &s;orts
of them: He begins with the <HI>Rumores,</HI> and
<HI>Libelli famo&s;i,</HI> &s;uch as concern the Reputation
of Men in Power; where he finds Fault
<PB N="11" REF="9">
with the common Mi&s;take, that takes No|tice
only of one &s;ort, <HI>viz.</HI> the Detractory
or Defamatory, whereas in truth there are
three &s;orts, the Detractory, the Additory,
and the Tran&s;latory. The Additory gives
to a Great Man a greater &s;hare of Reputa|tion
than belongs to him, to enable him to
&s;erve &s;ome good End or Purpo&s;e. The De|tractory
or Defamatory, is a Lye which
takes from a Great Man the Reputation that
ju&s;tly belongs to him, for fear he &s;hould u&s;e
it to the Detriment of the Publick. The
Tran&s;latory, is a Lye that transfers the Me|rit
of a Man's good Action to another who
is in him&s;elf more de&s;erving; or, transfers
the Demerit of a bad Action from the true
Author, to a Per&s;on who is in him&s;elf le&s;s de&s;er|ving.
He gives &s;everal In&s;tances of very great
Strokes in all the Three Kinds, e&s;pecially in
the la&s;t, when it was nece&s;&s;ary for the Good
of the Publick to be&s;tow the Valour and Con|duct
of one Man upon another, and that
of many to one Man; nay, even upon a
good Occa&s;ion, a Man may be rob'd of his
Victory by a Per&s;on that did not Command
in the Action. The Re&s;toring and the De|&s;troying
the Publick may be a&s;crib'd to Per|&s;ons
who had no hand in either. The Au|thor
exhorts all Gentlemen Practitioners to
exerci&s;e them&s;elves in the Tran&s;latory, be|cau&s;e
the Exi&s;tence of the Things them|&s;elves
being vi&s;ible, and not demanding any
<PB N="12" REF="10">
Proof, there wants nothing to be put upon
the Publick but a fal&s;e Author or a fal&s;e
Cau&s;e, which is no great Pre&s;umption upon
the Credulity of Mankind, to whom the &s;e|cret
Springs of things are for the mo&s;t part
unknown.</P>
<P>The Author proceeds to give &s;ome Pre|cepts
as to the Additory. That when one
a&s;cribes any thing to a Per&s;on which does not
belong to him, the Lye ought to be calcu|lated
not quite contradictory to his known
Qualities: <HI>Ex. gr.</HI> One would not make the
<HI>French</HI> King pre&s;ent at a Prote&s;tant Conven|ticle;
nor, like Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> re&s;tore the
Overplus of Taxes to her Subjects. One
would not bring in the <HI>Emperor</HI> giving two
Months Pay in Advance to his Troops; nor
the <HI>Dutch</HI> paying more, than their <HI>Quota.</HI>
One would not make the &s;ame Per&s;on zea|lous
for a Standing Army and Publick Li|berty;
nor an Athei&s;t &s;upport the Church;
nor a lewd Fellow a Reformer of Manners;
nor a hot-headed crack-brain'd Coxcomb for|ward
for a Scheme of Moderation. But if
it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that a Per&s;on is to
have &s;ome good adventitious Quality given
him, the Author's Precept is, that it &s;hould
not be done at fir&s;t in <HI>extremo gradu.</HI> For
Example: They &s;hould not make, a Covetous
Man give away all at once, Five thou&s;and
Pounds in a charitable generous way; Twen|ty
or Thirty Pounds may &s;uffice at fir&s;t,
<PB N="13" REF="11">
They &s;hould not introduce a Per&s;on of re|markable
Ingratitude to his Benefactors, re|warding
a poor Man for &s;ome good Office
that was done him thirty Years ago; but
they may allow him to acknowledge a Ser|vice
to a Per&s;on who is capable &s;till to do
him another. A Man who&s;e per&s;onal Cou|rage
is &s;u&s;pected, is not at fir&s;t to drive
whole Squadrons before him; but he may
be allow'd the Merit of &s;ome Squabble, or
throwing a Bottle at his Adver&s;ary's Head.</P>
<P>It will not be allow'd, to make a Great
Man, that is a known De&s;pi&s;er of Religion,
&s;pend whole Days in his Clo&s;et at his Devo|tion;
but, you may with Safety make him
&s;it out publick Prayers with Decency. A
Great Man, who has never been known wil|lingly
to pay a ju&s;t Debt, ought not all of
a &s;udden to be introduc'd making Re&s;ti|tution
of Thou&s;ands he has cheated; let it
&s;uffice at fir&s;t, to pay Twenty Pounds to a
Friend who has lo&s;t his Note.</P>
<P>He lays down the &s;ame Rules in the De|tractory
or Defamatory kind; that they
&s;hould not be quite oppo&s;ite to the Qualities
the Per&s;ons are &s;uppo&s;ed to have. Thus it
will not be found, according to the found
Rules of <HI>P&s;eudology,</HI> to report of a pious and
religious Prince, that he neglects his Devo|tion,
and would introduce Here&s;y; but, you
may report of a merciful Prince, that he has
Pardon'd a Criminal who did not de&s;erve it.
<PB N="14" REF="12">
You will be un&s;ucce&s;sful if you give out of a
Great Man, who is remarkable for his Fru|gality
for the Publick, that he &s;quanders away
the Nation's Money; but, you may &s;afely re|late
that he hoards it: You mu&s;t not affirm
he took a Bribe; but, you may freely cen&s;ure
him for being tardy in his Payments; Be|cau&s;e
though neither may be true, yet the
la&s;t is credible, the fir&s;t not. Of an open|hearted
generous Mini&s;ter you are not to
&s;ay, that he was in an Intrigue to Betray
his Country; but, you may affirm with
&s;ome Probability, that he was in an In|trigue
with a Lady. He warns all Practi|tioners
to take good heed to the&s;e Precepts,
for want of which, many of their Lies, of
late, have prov'd abortive on &s;hort-liv'd.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>In his Sixth Chapter he treats of the <HI>Mi|raculous</HI>;
by which he under&s;tands any thing
that exceeds the common Degrees of Proba|bility.
In re&s;pect of the People, it is divi|ded
into two &s;orts, the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 words">, or the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 words">,
Terrifying Lyes, and Animating or
Encouraging Lyes, both being extremely
u&s;eful on their proper Occa&s;ions. Concern|ing
the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 words">, he gives &s;everal Rules;
one of which is, that terrible Objects &s;hould
not be too frequently &s;hewn to the People,
le&s;t they grow familiar. He &s;ays, it is ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary that the People of <HI>England</HI>
&s;hould be frighted with the <HI>French</HI> King and
<PB N="15" REF="13">
the <HI>Pretender</HI> once a Year; but, that the
Bears &s;hould be chain'd up again till that
time Twelve-month. The want of Ob&s;er|ving
this &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Precept, in bring|ing
out the <HI>Raw-head and Bloody-bones</HI> upon
every trifling Occa&s;ion, has produc'd great
Indifference in the Vulgar of late Years. As
to the Animating or Encouraging Lyes, he
gives the following Rules; That they &s;hould
not far exceed the common degrees of Pro|bability,
and that there &s;hould be variety
of them, and the &s;ame Lye not ob&s;tinately
in&s;i&s;ted upon; that the Promi&s;&s;ory or Prog|no&s;ticating
Lyes &s;hould not be upon &s;hort
Days, for fear the Authors &s;hould have the
Shame and Confu&s;ion to &s;ee them&s;elves &s;pee|dily
contradicted. He examines by the&s;e
Rules, that well-meant, but unfortunate Lye
of the Conque&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> which continued
near twenty Years together; but at la&s;t, by
being too ob&s;tinately in&s;i&s;ted upon, it was
worn threadbare, and became un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>As to the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 words">, or the <HI>Prodigious,</HI>
he has little to advi&s;e, but that their Co|mets,
Whales and Dragons, &s;hould be &s;iza|ble;
their Storms, Tempe&s;ts, and Earth|quakes,
without the reach of a Days Jour|ney
of a Man and a Hor&s;e.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>The Seventh Chapter is wholly taken up
in an Enquiry, Which of the two Parties are
the greate&s;t Arti&s;ts in <HI>Political Lying.</HI> He
<PB N="16" REF="14">
owns the <HI>Tories</HI> have been better believed of
late; but, that the <HI>Whigs</HI> have much the
greater Genius's among&s;t them. He attri|butes
the late ill Succe&s;s of the <HI>Whig-Party</HI>
to their glutting the Market, and retailing
too much of a bad Commodity at once:
When there is too great a Quantity of
Worms, it is hard to catch Gudgeons. He
propo&s;es a Scheme for the Recovery of the
Credit of the <HI>Whig-Party,</HI> which indeed
&s;eems to be &s;omewhat Chimerical, and does
not &s;avour of that &s;ound Judgment the
Author has &s;hown in the re&s;t of the Work
It amounts to this, That the Party &s;hould
agree to vent nothing but Truth for three
Months together, which will give them Cre|dit
for &s;ix Months Lying afterwards. He
owns, that he believes it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible
to find fit Per&s;ons to execute this Scheme.
Towards the end of the Chapter, he in|veighs
&s;everely again&s;t the Folly of Parties,
in retaining &s;uch Scoundrels and Men of
Low Genius's to retail their Lyes; &s;uch as
mo&s;t of the pre&s;ent News-Writers are, who
be&s;ides a &s;trong Bent and Inclination towards
the Profe&s;&s;ion, &s;eem to be wholly ignorant
in the Rules of <HI>P&s;eudology,</HI> and not at all
qualified for &s;o weighty a Tru&s;t.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>In his Eighth Chapter he treats of &s;ome
extraordinary Genius's who have appear'd of
late Years, e&s;pecially in their Di&s;po&s;ition to|wards
<PB N="17" REF="15">
the <HI>Miraculous.</HI> He advi&s;es tho&s;e
hopeful Young-men to turn their Invention
to the Service of their Country, it being
inglorious, at this time, to employ their Ta|lent
in prodigious Fox-Cha&s;es, Hor&s;e-Cour&s;es,
Feats of Activity in Driving of Coaches,
Jumping, Running, Swallowing of Peaches,
Pulling out whole Sets of Teeth to clean, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
when their Country &s;tands &s;o much in need
of their A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Eighth Chapter is a Project for Uni|ting
the &s;everal &s;maller Corporations of Lyars
into one Society. It is too tedious to give
a full Account of the whole Scheme; what
is mo&s;t remarkable is, That this Society ought
to con&s;i&s;t of the Heads of each Party; that
no Lye is to pa&s;s current without their Ap|probation,
they being the be&s;t Judges of the
pre&s;ent Exigencies, and what &s;ort of Lyes
are demanded: That in &s;uch a Corporation
there ought to be Men of all Profe&s;&s;ions,
that the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 words">, and the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 words">, that is,
<HI>Decency</HI> and <HI>Probability,</HI> may be ob&s;erv'd as
much as po&s;&s;ible: That be&s;ides the Per&s;ons
above-mentioned, this Society ought to con|&s;i&s;t
of the hopeful Genius's about the Town
(of which there are great plenty to be pick'd
up in the &s;everal Coffee-hou&s;es) Travellers,
Virtuo&s;o's, Fox-hunters, Jockeys, Attorneys,
Old Sea-men and Soldiers out of the Ho&s;pi|tals
of <HI>Greenwich</HI> and <HI>Chel&s;ea.</HI> To this So|ciety,
<PB N="18" REF="16">
&s;o Con&s;tituted, ought to be committed
the &s;ole Management of <HI>Lying.</HI> That in their
outer Room there ought always to attend

Credulity, a Generation that thrives mightily
in this Soil and Climate: He thinks a &s;ufficient
Number of them may be pick'd up any where
about the <HI>Exchange:</HI> The&s;e are to Circulate
what the other Coin; for no Man &s;preads a

unle&s;s the Ea&s;terly Winds reign. That it
ought to be Penal, for any body to talk of
any thing but the Lye of the Day. That
the Society is to maintain a &s;ufficient Num|ber

furni&s;h Hints and Topicks for Invention;
and a general Corre&s;pondence in all the
Market-Towns, for Circulating their Lyes.
That if any one of die Society were ob&s;erv'd
to blu&s;h, or look out of Countenance, or
want a nece&s;&s;ary Circum&s;tance in telling
the Lye, he ought to be expell'd, and de|clar'd
incapable. Be&s;ides the Roaring Lies,
there ought to be a private Committee for
Whi&s;pers, con&s;tituted of the able&s;t Men of
<PB N="19" REF="17">
the Society. Here the Author makes a Di|gre&s;&s;ion
in Prai&s;e of the <HI>Whig-Party,</HI> for the
right Under&s;tanding and U&s;e of <HI>Proof-Lyes.</HI>
A <HI>Proof-Lye</HI> is like a Proof-Charge for a
Piece of Ordnance, to try a Standard-Credu|lity.
Of &s;uch a nature he takes Tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation
to be in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> a Proof|Article,
which if any one &s;wallows, they are
&s;ure he will dige&s;t every thing el&s;e. There|fore
the <HI>Whig-Party</HI> do wi&s;ely, to try the
Credulity of the People &s;ometimes by <HI>Swin|gers,</HI>
that they may be able to judge to what
heighth they may Charge them afterwards.
Towards the End of this Chapter, he warns
the Heads of Parties again&s;t Believing their
own Lyes; which has prov'd of pernicious
Con&s;equence of late, both a Wi&s;e Party
and a Wi&s;e Nation having regulated their Affairs
upon Lyes of their own Invention. The
Cau&s;es of this he &s;uppo&s;es to be too great a
Zeal and Inten&s;ene&s;s in the Practice of this
<HI>Art,</HI> and a vehement Heat in mutual Con|ver&s;ation,
whereby they per&s;wade one ano|ther,
that what they wi&s;h, and report to be
true, is really &s;o. That all Parties have been
&s;ubject to this Misfortune: The <HI>Jacobites</HI>
have been con&s;tantly infe&s;ted with it; but,
the <HI>Whigs</HI> of late &s;eem ev'n to exceed them
in this ill Habit and Weakne&s;s. To this
Chapter, the Author &s;ubjoins a Calendar of
Lyes proper for the &s;everal Months of the
Year.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="20" REF="18">
<P>The Ninth Chapter treats of the Celerity
and Duration of Lyes. As to the Celerity
of their Motion, the Author &s;ays it is almo&s;t
incredible: He gives &s;everal In&s;tances of Lyes
that have gone fa&s;ter than a Man can ride
Po&s;t: Your <HI>Terrifying Lyes</HI> travel at a prodi|gious
rate, above ten Miles an hour; your
Whi&s;pers move in a narrow Vortex, but ve|ry
&s;wiftly. The Author &s;ays it is impo&s;|&s;ible
to explain &s;everal <HI>Phoenomena</HI> in relation
to the Celerity of Lyes, without the Suppo|&s;ition
of <HI>Synchroni&s;m</HI> and <HI>Combination.</HI> As to
the Duration of Lyes, he &s;ays they are of all
&s;orts, from Hours and Days to Ages; that
there are &s;ome which, like your In&s;ects, die and
revive again in a different Form; that good
Arti&s;ts, like People who build upon a &s;hort
Lea&s;e, will calculate the Duration of a
Lye &s;urely to an&s;wer their purpo&s;e; to la&s;t
ju&s;t as long, and no longer, than the Turn
is &s;erv'd.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>The Tenth Chapter treats of the Chara|cteri&s;ticks
of Lyes; how to know, when,
where, and by whom invented: Your <HI>Dutch,
Engli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Ware, are amply di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd
from one another; an <HI>Exchange-Lye</HI>
from one Coin'd at the other End of the
Town; Great Judgment is to be &s;hewn
as to the Place where the Species is intended
to Circulate: Very low and ba&s;e Coin will
&s;erve for <HI>Wapping:</HI> There are &s;everal Coffee|hou&s;es
<PB N="21" REF="19">
that have their particular Stamps, which
a judicious Practitioner may ea&s;ily know.
All your Great Men have their proper <HI>Phan|tateu&s;ticks.</HI>
The Author &s;ays he has attained,
by Study and Application, to &s;o great Skill
in this Matter, that bring him any Lye, he
can tell who&s;e Image it bears &s;o truly, as
the Great Man him&s;elf &s;hall not have the
face to deny it. The Promi&s;&s;ory Lyes of
Great Men are known by Shouldering, Hug|ging,
Squeezing, Smiling, Bowing; and Lyes
in Matter of Fact, by immoderate Swearing.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>He &s;pends the whole Eleventh Chapter on
one &s;imple Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether a Lye is best
contradicted by Truth, or another Lye.</HI> The
Author &s;ays, that con&s;idering the large Ex|tent
of the Cylindrical Surface of the Soul,
and the great Propen&s;ity to believe Lyes in
the generality of Mankind of late Years, he
thinks the propere&s;t Contradiction to a Lye,
is another Lye: For Example; If it &s;hould be
reported that the Pretender was at <HI>London,</HI>
one would not contradict it by &s;aying he
never was in <HI>England</HI>; but you mu&s;t prove
by Eye-witne&s;&s;es that he came no farther
than <HI>Greenwich,</HI> but then went back again.
Thus if it be &s;pread about that a great Per|&s;on
were dying of &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;e, you mu&s;t
not &s;ay the Truth, that they are in Health,
and never had &s;uch a Di&s;ea&s;e; but, that they
are &s;lowly recovering of it. So there was,
<PB N="22" REF="20">
not long ago, a Gentleman who affirmed,
That the Treaty with <HI>France</HI> for bringing in
Popery and Slavery into <HI>England,</HI> was Sign'd
the 15th of <HI>September</HI>; to which another an|&s;wered
very judiciou&s;ly, not by oppo&s;ing
Truth to his Lye, That there was no &s;uch
Treaty; but that, to his certain Know|ledge,
there were many things in that Treaty
not yet adju&s;ted.</P>
