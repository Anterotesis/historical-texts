<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF NOURJAHAD.</HEAD>
<P>SChemzeddin was in his two and twentieth year when he mounted the throne of Per&s;ia. His great wi&s;dom and extraordinary endowments rendered him the delight of his people, and filled them with expectations of a glorious and happy reign. Among&s;t the number of per&s;ons who &s;tood candidates for the young &s;ultan's favour, in the new admi|ni&s;tration, which was now going to take place, none &s;eemed &s;o likely to &s;ucceed,
<PB N="2" REF="4">
as Nourjahad the &s;on of Namarand. This young man was about the age of Schemzeddin, and had been bred up with him from his infancy. To a very engaging per&s;on was added a &s;weet|ne&s;s of temper, a liveline&s;s of fancy, and a certain agreeable manner of ad|dre&s;s, that engaged every one's affec|tions who approached him. The &s;ultan loved him, and every one looked on Nourjahad as the ri&s;ing &s;tar of the Per&s;ian court, whom his ma&s;ter's par|tial fondne&s;s would elevate to the high|e&s;t pinnacle of honour. Schemzeddin indeed was de&s;irous of promoting his favourite, yet notwith&s;tanding his at|tachment to him, he was not blind to his faults; but they appeared to him only &s;uch as are almo&s;t in&s;eparable from youth and inexperience; and he made no doubt but that Nourjahad, when
<PB N="3" REF="5">
time had a little more &s;ubdued his youthful pa&s;&s;ions, and matured his judgment, would be able to fill the place of his fir&s;t mini&s;ter, with abilities equal to any of his predece&s;&s;ors. He would not, however, even in his own private thoughts, re&s;olve on &s;o important a &s;tep, without fir&s;t con&s;ulting with &s;ome old lords of his court, who had been the con&s;tant friends and coun&s;ellors of the late &s;ultan his father. Accordingly hav|ing called them into his clo&s;et one day, he propo&s;ed the matter to them, and de&s;ired their opinion. But before they delivered it, he could ea&s;ily di&s;cover by the countenances of the&s;e grave and prudent men, that they di&s;approved his choice. What have you to object to Nourjahad, &s;aid the &s;ultan, finding that they all continued &s;ilent, looking at each other? His youth, replied the elde&s;t of
<PB N="4" REF="6">
the coun&s;ellors. That objection, an|&s;wered Schemzeddin, will grow lighter every day. His avarice, cried the &s;e|cond. Thou art not ju&s;t, &s;aid the &s;ul|tan, in charging him with that; he has no &s;upport but from my bounty, nor did he ever yet take advantage of that intere&s;t which he knows he has in me, to de&s;ire an encrea&s;e of it. What I have charged him with, is in his nature not|with&s;tanding, replied the old lord. What ha&s;t thou to urge, cried the &s;ul|tan, to his third advi&s;er? His love of plea&s;ure, an&s;wered he. That, cried Schemzeddin, is as groundle&s;s an accu|&s;ation as the other; I have known him from his childhood, and think few men of his years are &s;o temperate. Yet would he indulge to exce&s;s, if it were in his power, replied the old man. The &s;ultan now addre&s;&s;ed the fourth: What
<PB N="5" REF="7">
fault ha&s;t thou to object to him, cried he? His irreligion, an&s;wered the &s;age. Thou art even more &s;evere, replied the &s;ultan, than the re&s;t of thy bre|thren, and I believe Nourjahad as good a Mu&s;&s;ulman as thy&s;elf. He di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed them coldly from his clo&s;et; and the four coun&s;ellors &s;aw how impolitic a thing it was to oppo&s;e the will of their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>Though Schemzeddin &s;eemed di&s;|plea&s;ed with the remon&s;trances of the old men, they neverthele&s;s had &s;ome weight with him. It is the intere&s;t of Nourjahad, &s;aid he, to conceal his faults from me; the age and experience of the&s;e men doubtle&s;s has furni&s;hed them with more &s;agacity than my youth can boa&s;t of; and he may be in reality what they have repre&s;ented him. This
<PB N="6" REF="8">
thought di&s;quieted the &s;ultan, for he loved Nourjahad as his brother. Yet who knows, cried he, but it may be envy in the&s;e old men? they may be provoked at having a youth rai&s;ed to that honour to which each of them per|haps in his own heart a&s;pires. We can &s;ometimes form a better judgment of a man's real di&s;po&s;ition, from an unguard|ed &s;ally of his own lips, than from a clo&s;e ob&s;ervation of years, where the per&s;on, con&s;cious of being ob&s;erved, is watchful and cautious of every look and expre&s;&s;ion that falls from him. I will found Nourjahad when he lea&s;t &s;u&s;pects that I have any &s;uch de&s;ign, and from his own mouth will I judge him.</P>
<P>It was not long before the &s;ultan had an opportunity of executing his purpo&s;e. Having pa&s;t the evening with his fa|vourite
<PB N="7" REF="9">
at a banquet, where they had both indulged pretty freely, he invited Nourjahad to a walk by moon-light in the gardens of the &s;eraglio. Schemzed|din leaned on his &s;houlder as they ram|bled from one delicious &s;cene to another; &s;cenes rendered &s;till more enchanting by the &s;ilence of the night, the mild lu&s;tre of the moon now at full, and the exha|lations which aro&s;e from a thou&s;and odo|riferous &s;hrubs. The &s;pirits of Nour|jahad were exhilerated by the mirth and fe&s;tivity in which he had pa&s;&s;ed the day. The &s;ultan's favour intoxicated him; his thoughts were di&s;&s;ipated by a variety of agreeable &s;en&s;ations, and his whole &s;oul as it were rapt in a kind of plea&s;ing delirium. Such was the frame of Nour|jahad's mind, when the &s;ultan, with an a&s;&s;umed levity, throwing him&s;elf down on a bank of violets, and familiarly
<PB N="8" REF="10">
drawing his favourite to &s;it by him, &s;aid, <HI>Tell me, Nourjahad, and tell me truly, what would &s;atisfy thy wi&s;hes, if thou wert certain of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing what&s;oever thou &s;hould&s;t de&s;ire?</HI> Nourjahad remaining &s;i|lent for &s;ome time, the &s;ultan, &s;miling, repeated his que&s;tion. My wi&s;hes, an|&s;wered the favourite, are &s;o boundle&s;s, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to tell you directly; but in two words, I &s;hould de&s;ire to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of inexhau&s;tible riches, and to enable me to enjoy them to the utmo&s;t, to have my life prolonged to eternity. Would&s;t thou then, &s;aid Schemzeddin, forego thy hopes of pa|radi&s;e? I would, an&s;wered the favour|ite, make a paradi&s;e of this earthly globe whil&s;t it la&s;ted, and take my chance for the other afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">
The &s;ultan, at hearing the&s;e words, &s;tarted up from his &s;eat, and knitting his brow, Be gone, &s;aid he, &s;ternly, thou art no longer worthy of my love or my confidence: I thought to have promoted thee to the highe&s;t honours, but &s;uch a wretch does not de&s;erve to live. Ambition, though a vice, is yet the vice of great minds; but avarice, and an in&s;atiable thir&s;t for plea&s;ure, de|grades a man below the brutes.</P>
<P>Saying this, he turned his back on Nourjahad, and was about to leave him; when the favourite catching him by the robe, and falling on his knees, Let not my lord's indignation, &s;aid he, be kin|dled again&s;t his &s;lave, for a few light words, which fell from him only in &s;port: I &s;wear to thee, my prince, by our holy prophet, that what I &s;aid is far
<PB N="10" REF="12">
from being the &s;entiments of my heart; my de&s;ire for wealth extends not farther than to be enabled to procure the &s;ober enjoyments of life; and for length of years, let not mine be prolonged a day, beyond that, in which I can be &s;ervice|able to my prince and my country.</P>
<P>It is not, replied the &s;ultan, with a mildne&s;s cha&s;tened with gravity, it is not for mortal eyes to penetrate into the clo&s;e rece&s;&s;es of the human heart; thou ha&s;t atte&s;ted thy innocence by an oath; it is all that can be required from man to man; but remember thou ha&s;t cal|led our great prophet to witne&s;s; him thou can&s;t not deceive, though me thou maye&s;t.</P>
<P>Schemzeddin left him without wait|ing for his reply; and Nourjahad, ex|ceedingly
<PB N="11" REF="13">
mortified that his unguarded declaration had &s;o much le&s;&s;ened him in his ma&s;ter's e&s;teem, retired to his own hou&s;e, which immediately joined the &s;ultan's palace.</P>
<P>He pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the night in tra|ver&s;ing his chamber, being unable to take any re&s;t. He dreaded the thoughts of lo&s;ing the &s;ultan's favour, on which alone he depended for his future ad|vancement; and tormenting him&s;elf all night with apprehen&s;ions of his di&s;grace, he found him&s;elf &s;o indi&s;po&s;ed in the morning, that he was unable to leave his chamber. He &s;pent the day in gloomy reflections without &s;uffering any one to come near him, or taking any repa&s;t: and when night came, wearied with painful thoughts, and want of &s;leep, he threw him&s;elf on his bed. But his
<PB N="12" REF="14">
&s;lumbers were di&s;turbed by perplexing dreams. What had been the &s;ubject of his anxiety when awake, &s;erved now to imbitter and di&s;tract his re&s;t: his fancy repre&s;ented the &s;ultan to him as he had la&s;t &s;een him in the garden, his looks &s;evere, and his words menacing. 'Go wretch, he thought he heard him cry, go &s;eek thy bread in a remote country, thou ha&s;t nothing to expect from me but contempt.'</P>
<P>Nourjahad awoke in agonies: Oh heaven, cried he aloud, that I could now inherit the &s;ecret wi&s;h I was fool enough to di&s;clo&s;e to thee, how little &s;hould I regard thy threats! And thou &s;halt, Oh Nourjahad, replied a voice, po&s;&s;e&s;s the utmo&s;t wi&s;hes of thy &s;oul! Nourjahad &s;tarted up in his bed, and rubbed his eyes, doubting whether he
<PB N="13" REF="15">
was really awake, or whether it was not his troubled imagination which cheated him with this delu&s;ive promi&s;e; when behold! to his unutterable a&s;toni&s;hment, he &s;aw a refulgent light in his chamber, and at his bed's &s;ide &s;tood a youth of more than mortal beauty. The lu&s;tre of his white robes dazzled his eyes; his long and &s;hining hair was incircled with a wreath of flowers that breathed the odours of paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>Nourjahad gazed at him, but had not power to open his mouth. Be not afraid, &s;aid the divine youth, with a voice of ineffable &s;weetne&s;s; I am thy guardian genius, who have carefully watched over thee from thy infancy, though never till this hour have I been permitted to make my&s;elf vi&s;ible to thee. I was pre|&s;ent at thy conver&s;ation in the garden
<PB N="14" REF="16">
with Schemzeddin, I was a witne&s;s to thy unguarded declaration, but found thee afterwards awed by his frowns to retract what thou had&s;t &s;aid: I &s;aw too the rigour of the &s;ultan's looks as he departed from thee, and know that they proceeded from his doubting thy truth. I, though an immortal &s;pirit, am not omni&s;cient; to God only are the &s;ecrets of the heart revealed; &s;peak boldly then, thou highly favoured of our prophet, and know that I have power from Mahomet to grant thy reque&s;t, be it what it will. Would&s;t thou be re|&s;tored to the favour and confidence of thy ma&s;ter, and receive from his friend|&s;hip and genero&s;ity the reward of thy long attachment to him, or do&s;t thou really de&s;ire the accompli&s;hment of that extravagant wi&s;h, which thou did&s;t in
<PB N="15" REF="17">
the openne&s;s of thy heart avow to him la&s;t night?</P>
<P>Nourjahad, a little recovered from his amazement, and encouraged by the con|de&s;cen&s;ion of his cele&s;tial vi&s;itant, bowed his head low in token of ado|ration.</P>
<P>Di&s;gui&s;e to thee, Oh &s;on of paradi&s;e, replied he, were vain and fruitle&s;s; if I di&s;&s;embled to Schemzeddin it was in order to rein&s;tate my&s;elf in his good opinion, the only means in my power to &s;ecure my future pro&s;pects: from thee I can have no rea&s;on to conceal my thoughts; and &s;ince the care of my hap|pine&s;s is con&s;igned to thee my guardian angel; let me po&s;&s;e&s;s that wi&s;h, extra|vagant as it may &s;eem, which I fir&s;t de|clared.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">
Ra&s;h mortal, replied the &s;hining vi|&s;ion, reflect once more, before you re|ceive the fatal boon; for once granted, you will wi&s;h perhaps, and wi&s;h in vain, to have it recalled. What have I to fear, an&s;wered Nourjahad, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of endle&s;s riches and of immortality? Your own pa&s;&s;ions, &s;aid the heavenly youth. I will &s;ubmit to all the evils ari&s;ing from them, replied Nourjahad, give me but the power of gratifying them in their full extent. Take thy wi&s;h then, cried the genius, with a look of di&s;content. The contents of this viol will confer immortality on thee, and to-morrow's &s;un &s;hall behold thee richer than all the kings of the Ea&s;t. Nourjahad &s;tretched his hands out eagerly to receive a ve&s;&s;el of gold, enriched with precious &s;tones, which the angel took from under his mantle. Stop, cried the aerial being,
<PB N="17" REF="19">
and hear the condition, with which thou mu&s;t accept the wondrous gift I am now about to be&s;tow. Know then; that your exi&s;tence here &s;hall equal the date of this &s;ublunary globe; yet to enjoy life all that while, is not in my power to grant. Nourjahad was going to in|terrupt the cele&s;tial, to de&s;ire him to explain this, when he prevented him, by proceeding thus: Your life, &s;aid he, will be frequently interrupted by the temporary death of &s;leep. Doubtle&s;s, replied Nourjahad, nature would lan|gui&s;h without that &s;overeign balm. Thou mi&s;under&s;tande&s;t me, cried the ge|nius; I do not mean that ordinary repo&s;e which nature requires: The &s;leep thou mu&s;t be &s;ubject to, at certain periods, will la&s;t for months, years, nay, for a whole revolution of Saturn at a time, or perhaps for a century. Frightful! cried
<PB N="18" REF="20">
Nourjahad, with an emotion that made him forget the re&s;pect which was due to the pre&s;ence of his guardian angel. He &s;eemed &s;u&s;pended, while the radiant youth proceeded; It is worth con&s;ider|ing, re&s;olve not too ha&s;tily. If the frame of man, replied Nourjahad, in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of things, requires for the &s;upport of that &s;hort &s;pan of life which is allotted to him, a con&s;tant and regular portion of &s;leep, which includes at lea&s;t one third of his exi&s;tence; my life, perhaps, &s;tretched &s;o much beyond its natural date, may require a &s;till greater propor|tion of re&s;t, to pre&s;erve my body in due health and vigour. If this be the ca&s;e, I &s;ubmit to the conditions; for what is thirty or fifty years out of eternity? Thou art mi&s;taken, replied the genius; and though thy rea&s;oning is not unphilo|&s;ophical, yet is it far from reaching the
<PB N="19" REF="21">
true cau&s;e of the&s;e my&s;terious conditions which are offered thee; know that the&s;e are contingencies which depend entirely on thy&s;elf. Let me be&s;eech you, &s;aid Nourjahad, to explain this. If thou walke&s;t, &s;aid the genius, in the paths of virtue, thy days will be crowned with gladne&s;s, and the even tenor of thy life undi&s;turbed by any evil; but if, on the contrary, thou perverte&s;t the good which is in thy power, and &s;ette&s;t thy heart on iniquity, thou wilt thus be occa&s;ionally puni&s;hed by a total privation of thy fa|culties. If this be all, cried Nourjahad, then am I &s;ure I &s;hall never incur the penalty; for though I mean to enjoy all the plea&s;ures that life can be&s;tow, yet am I a &s;tranger to my own heart, if it ever lead me to the wilful commi&s;&s;ion of a crime. The genius &s;ighed. Vouch&s;afe then, proceeded Nourjahad, vouch&s;afe, I
<PB N="20" REF="22">
conjure you, mo&s;t adorable and benign &s;pirit, to fulfil your promi&s;e, and keep me not longer in &s;u&s;pence. Saying this, he again reached forth his hand for the golden ve&s;&s;el, which the genius no longer with-held from him. Hold thy no&s;trils over that viol, &s;aid he, and let the fumes of the liquor which it con|tains a&s;cend to thy brain. Nourjahad opened the ve&s;&s;el, out of which a vapour i&s;&s;ued of a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite fragrance; it formed a thick atmo&s;phere about his head, and &s;ent out &s;uch volatile and &s;harp effluvia, as made his eyes &s;mart exceedingly, and he was obliged to &s;hut them whil&s;t he &s;nuffed up the e&s;&s;ence. He remained not long in this &s;ituation, for the &s;ubtle &s;pirit quickly evaporating, the effects in&s;tantly cea&s;ed, and he open|ed his eyes; but the apparition was va|ni&s;hed, and his apartment in total dark|ne&s;s.
<PB N="21" REF="23">
Had not he &s;till found the viol in his hands, which contained the precious liquor, he would have looked on all this as a dream; but &s;o &s;ub&s;tantial a proof of the reality of what had happened, leaving no room for doubts, he returned thanks to his guardian genius, whom he concluded, though invi&s;ible, to be &s;till within hearing, and putting the golden ve&s;&s;el under his pillow, filled as he was with the mo&s;t delightful ideas, compo&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;leep.</P>
<P>The &s;un was at his meridian height when he awoke next day; and the vi&s;ion of the preceding night immediately re|curring to his memory, he &s;prung ha&s;tily from his bed; but how great was his &s;urprize, how high his tran&s;ports, at &s;ee|ing the accompli&s;hment of the genius's promi&s;e! His chamber was &s;urrounded
<PB N="22" REF="24">
with &s;everal large urns of poli&s;hed bra&s;s, &s;ome of which were filled with gold coin of different value and impre&s;&s;ions; others with ingots of fine gold; and others with precious &s;tones of prodi|gious &s;ize and lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Amazed, enraptured at the &s;ight, he greedily examined his trea&s;ures, and looking into each of the urns one after the other, in one of them he found a &s;croll of paper, with the&s;e words written on it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">I have fulfilled my promi&s;e to thee, Oh Nourjahad. Thy days are without number, thy riches inexhau&s;tible, yet cannot I exempt thee from the evils to which all the &s;ons of Adam are &s;ub|ject. I cannot &s;creen thee from the machinations of envy, nor the rapaci|ou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="23" REF="25">
of power: thy own prudence mu&s;t henceforth be thy guard. There is a &s;ubterraneous cave in thy garden where thou may&s;t conceal thy trea&s;ure: I have marked the place, and thou wilt ea&s;ily find it. Farewel, my charge is at an end.</Q></P>
<P>And well ha&s;t thou acquitted thy&s;elf of this charge, mo&s;t munificent and be|nevolent genius, cried Nourjahad; ten thou&s;and thanks to thee for this la&s;t friendly warning; I &s;hould be a fool indeed if I had not &s;agacity enough to pre&s;erve my&s;elf again&s;t rapaciou&s;ne&s;s or envy; I will prevent the effects of the fir&s;t, by concealing thee, my precious trea&s;ure, thou &s;ource of all felicity, where no mortal &s;hall di&s;cover thee; and for the other, my bounty &s;hall di&s;arm it of its &s;ting. Enjoy thy&s;elf, Nourjahad,
<PB N="24" REF="26">
riot in luxurious delights, and laugh at Schemzeddin's impotent re&s;entment.</P>
<P>He ha&s;tened down into his garden, in order to find the cave, of which he was not long in &s;earch. In a remote corner, &s;tood the ruins of a &s;mall temple, which in former days, before the true religion prevailed in Per&s;ia, had been dedicated to the wor&s;hip of the Gentiles. The ve&s;tiges of this little building were &s;o curious, that they were &s;uffered to re|main, as an ornament, where they &s;tood. It was rai&s;ed on a mount, and according to the cu&s;tom of idolaters, &s;urrounded with &s;hady trees. On a branch of one of the&s;e, Nourjahad perceived hanging a &s;carf of fine white taffety, to which was &s;u&s;pended a large key of burni&s;hed &s;teel.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">
Nourjahad's eager curio&s;ity, &s;oon ren|dered his diligence &s;ucce&s;sful, in finding the door, to which this belonged; it was within-&s;ide the walls of the temple, and under what formerly &s;eemed to have been the altar. He de&s;cended by a few &s;teps into a pretty &s;pacious cavern, and by groping about, for there was &s;carce any light, he judged it large enough to contain his trea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Whether his guardian genius had contrived it purely for his u&s;e, or whe|ther it had been originally made for &s;ome other purpo&s;e, he did not trouble him&s;elf to enquire; but glad to have found &s;o &s;afe a place, in which to depo|&s;ite his wealth, he returned to his hou&s;e;
<PB N="26" REF="28">
and having given orders that no vi&s;itors &s;hould approach him, he &s;hut him&s;elf up in his chamber for the re&s;t of the day, in order to contemplate his own happi|ne&s;s, and without interruption, to lay down plans of various plea&s;ures and de|lights for ages to come.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Nourjahad was rich only in &s;peculation, he really thought that he &s;hould be able to keep his word with the genius. That the employing his wealth to noble and generous purpo&s;es, would have con&s;tituted great part of his happine&s;s; and that without plunging into guilt, he could have gratified the utmo&s;t of his wi&s;hes. But he &s;oon found that his heart had deceived him, and that there is a wide difference be|tween
<PB N="27" REF="29">
the fancied and actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wealth. He was immediately ab|&s;orbed in &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and thought of no|thing but the indulgence of his own appetites. My temper, &s;aid he, as he lay &s;tretched at length on a &s;opha, does not much incline me to take any trouble; I &s;hall therefore never a&s;pire at high em|ployments, nor would I be the &s;ultan of Per&s;ia, if I might; for what addition would that make to my happine&s;s? None at all; it would only di&s;turb my brea&s;t with cares, from which I am now exempt. And which of the real, &s;ub|&s;tantial delights of life, could I then po&s;|&s;e&s;s, that are not now within my power? I will have a magnificent hou&s;e in town, and others in the country, with delicious parks and gardens. What does it &s;ig|nify
<PB N="28" REF="30">
whether or not they are dignified with the names of palaces? or whether I am attended by princes or &s;laves? The latter will do my bu&s;ine&s;s as well, and be more &s;ub&s;ervient to my will. There are three particulars indeed, in which I will exceed my ma&s;ter. In the beau|ties of my &s;eraglio; the delicacies of my table; and the excellence of my mu&s;i|cians. In the former of the&s;e e&s;pecially, King Solomon him&s;elf &s;hall be outdone.

<P>He had tried the weight of the urns one by one; tho&s;e which contained the gold he found &s;o extreamly heavy that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to lift them.

Tho&s;e which held the jewels, he could ea&s;ily carry.

<P>For the three &s;ucceeding days his thoughts were &s;o perplexed and divided, that he knew not which of his favourite &s;chemes he &s;hould fir&s;t enter upon. Sa|tisfied with having the means in his power, he neglected tho&s;e ends for which

In the&s;e thoughts he was &s;o immer&s;ed, that he entirely forgot to pay his court to Schemzeddin; and without any other enjoyment of his riches, than the plea&s;ure of thinking of them, he &s;at for whole days alone, alter|nately improving on, or rejecting, &s;uch &s;y&s;tems of happine&s;s as aro&s;e in his mind.</P>

<P>Nourjahad received this me&s;&s;age with the utmo&s;t indifference; but without daring to &s;hew any mark of di&s;re&s;pect. Tell my lord the &s;ultan, &s;aid he, that I would not have been thus long without pro&s;trating my&s;elf at his feet, but that I was ha&s;tily &s;ent for to vi&s;it a kin&s;man,

The hou&s;e that his goodne&s;s be&s;tows on me, with all grati|tude I thankfully accept, as it will daily remind me that Schemzeddin does not utterly dete&s;t his &s;lave. Saying this, he pre&s;ented the officer with a hand&s;ome diamond, which he took from his finger, and begged him to accept of it as a token of his re&s;pect for him, and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to the &s;ultan's plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="39">
Though Nourjahad had given &s;uch a turn to his acceptance of the hou&s;e, his true rea&s;on was, that having his trea|&s;ure buried in the garden, he thought he could not without great difficulty, and the hazard of a di&s;covery, remove it. Thus had he already, in two in&s;tances, been obliged to depart from truth, in con&s;equence of his ill judged and perni|cious choice.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e which the &s;ultan had given him, was hand&s;ome and commodious; and he thought by enlarging and furni&s;h|ing it magnificently, it would &s;ufficiently an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of his town re&s;i|dence; be&s;ides, as it was a royal grant, he was &s;ure of remaining unmole&s;ted in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="40">
He now bent his thoughts on nothing but in giving a loo&s;e to his appetites, and indulging without controul in every delight which his pa&s;&s;ions or imagination could &s;ugge&s;t to him. As he was not of an active temper, he put the conduct of his plea&s;ures into the hands of one, whom he had lately received into his &s;er|vice. This man, who&s;e name was Ha|&s;em, he found had good &s;en&s;e, and a quickne&s;s of parts, which he thought qualified him for the tru&s;t he repo&s;ed in him. To him he committed the care of regulating his family, and appointed him the director of his hou&s;ehold. In &s;hort, under Ha&s;em's in&s;pection, who on this occa&s;ion di&s;played an admirable ta&s;te, his hou&s;e was &s;oon furni&s;hed with every thing that could charm the &s;en&s;es,
<PB N="39" REF="41">
or captivate the fancy. Co&s;tly furni|ture, magnificent habits, &s;umptuous equipages, and a grand retinue, fully gratified his vanity. By Ha&s;em's dili|gence his &s;eraglio was &s;oon adorned with a number of the mo&s;t beautiful female &s;laves, of almo&s;t every nation, whom he purcha&s;ed at a va&s;t expence. By Ha|&s;em's care, his board was repleni&s;hed with the mo&s;t delicious products of every climate; and by Ha&s;em's management he had a cho&s;en band of the mo&s;t &s;kilful mu&s;icians of the age; and by Ha&s;em's judgement and addre&s;s, he had retained in his hou&s;e &s;ome of the mo&s;t learned and ingenious men of all Per&s;ia, &s;killed in every art and &s;cience. The&s;e were received into his family for the in&s;truc|tion and entertainment of his hours of

reflection, if he &s;hould chance to be vi|&s;ited with any &s;uch.</P>
<P>Behold him now arrived at the height of human felicity; for, to ren|der his happine&s;s incapable of addi|tion, he had di&s;tingui&s;hed among&s;t the beauties of his &s;eraglio, a young maid, &s;o exqui&s;itely charming and ac|compli&s;hed, that he gave her the intire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart; and preferring her to the re&s;t of his women, pa&s;t whole days in her apartment. By Mandana he found him&s;elf equally beloved; a fe|licity very rare among&s;t Ea&s;tern hu&s;|bands; and longing to unbo&s;om him|&s;elf to one, on who&s;e tenderne&s;s and fide|lity he could rely, to her he di&s;clo&s;ed the marvellous &s;tory of his de&s;tiny. His mind thus di&s;burthened of this impor|tant &s;ecret, which he had often longed to
<PB N="41" REF="43">
divulge, but could find none whom he dared to tru&s;t with the di&s;covery, he had not one anxious thought remaining. He gave him&s;elf up to plea&s;ures, he threw off all re&s;traint, he plunged at once into a tide of luxurious enjoyments; he for|got his duty towards God, and neglected all the laws of his prophet. He grew lazy and effeminate; and had not his pride now and then urged him to di&s;|play to the wondering eyes of the public, the magnificence of his &s;tate, he would &s;eldom have been inclined to go out of his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every thing that his &s;oul could wi&s;h, he continued for the &s;pace of three moons, without any inter|ruption, to wallow in voluptuou&s;ne&s;s:
<PB N="42" REF="44">
When one morning ju&s;t as he was pre|paring to &s;et out for a beautiful villa, which Ha&s;em had recommended to him for his rural retirement, and which he purpo&s;ed to buy if it an&s;wered his de|&s;cription, he was prevented by a me&s;|&s;enger from the &s;ultan. It was the &s;ame per&s;on who once before had been &s;ent to him, to forbid him the court. I am &s;orry, my lord, &s;aid he, on entering Nourjahad's apartment, to be a &s;econd time the bearer of unwelcome tidings; but Schemzeddin, hearing of the extra|ordinary grandeur and magnificence in which you live, a magnificence indeed equal to that of the &s;ultan him&s;elf, would needs know whence you derive your wealth, which &s;eems &s;o much to &s;urpa&s;s that of any of his &s;ubjects; and has com|manded
<PB N="43" REF="45">
me to conduct you to his pre|&s;ence, in order to give an account of it.</P>
<P>Nourjahad was exceedingly &s;tartled at this unexpected &s;ummons; but it was in vain to di&s;pute the &s;ultan's orders, and he was forced, though with great reluc|tance, to accompany the officer to the palace of Schemzeddin.</P>
<P>He entered it trembling, fearful to declare a fal&s;ehood to his &s;overeign, yet &s;till more unwilling to confe&s;s the truth.</P>
<P>In this &s;u&s;pence the officer left him, to acquaint the &s;ultan of his arrival. He waited not long before he was admitted to the royal pre&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46">
Whence is it, Nourjahad, &s;aid the &s;ul|tan, that thy imprudence hath drawn on thee the attention of my whole em|pire, in&s;omuch that the repre&s;entations made to me of thy pomp and luxury, now renders it nece&s;&s;ary to enquire into thy riches. They &s;eem indeed to be immen&s;e. Who was that relation that bequeathed them to thee, and wherein do they con&s;i&s;t?</P>
<P>Though Nourjahad had endeavoured to prepare him&s;elf with proper an&s;wers to all tho&s;e que&s;tions, which he naturally expected would be a&s;ked on the occa|&s;ion, he was neverthele&s;s confounded; he could not utter the lies he had framed with the unaba&s;hed look of &s;incerity;
<PB N="45" REF="47">
his &s;peech faltered, and his colour changed. Schemzeddin &s;aw his confu|&s;ion. I perceive, &s;aid he, there is &s;ome my&s;tery in this affair which thou ha&s;t no mind to di&s;cover; I pray heaven that thou ha&s;t u&s;ed no &s;ini&s;ter means to come at the great wealth which I am told thou po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e&s;t! Confe&s;s the truth, and beware of prevaricating with thy prince.</P>
<P>Nourjahad, frightened at the difficul|ties he found him&s;elf involved in, fell at the &s;ultan's feet. If my lord, &s;aid he, will give me a patient hearing, and for|give the pre&s;umption of his &s;ervant, I will unfold &s;uch wonders as will amaze him, and at the &s;ame time utter nothing but the &s;tricte&s;t truth. The &s;ultan
<PB N="46" REF="48">
turned coldly towards him; but by &s;eeming to attend to his explanation, en|couraged him to proceed.</P>
<P>He then gave a faithful relation of the vi&s;ion he had &s;een, with all the con|&s;equences of that miraculous event. Schemzeddin &s;uffered him to conclude his narration without interruption; but in&s;tead of &s;hewing any marks of &s;urprize, or appearing to credit what he &s;aid, looking at him with the utmo&s;t indig|nation, Audacious wretch, cried he, how dare&s;t thou pre&s;ume thus to abu&s;e my patience, and affront my under&s;tanding with the relation of &s;o ridiculous a for|gery? Go tell thy incredible tales to fools and children, but dare not to in&s;ult
<PB N="47" REF="49">
thy &s;overeign with &s;uch outrageous fal&s;ehoods.</P>
<P>Though Nourjahad was terrified at the &s;ultan's anger, he neverthele&s;s per|&s;i&s;ted in his declaration, confirming all he had &s;aid by the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths. The &s;ultan commanded him to be &s;ilent. Thou art mad, &s;aid he; I perceive now that the riches thou ha&s;t acquired, let the means be what they may, have turned thy brain; and I am now more than ever convinced of the &s;ordidne&s;s of thy mind, when the unexpected acqui|&s;ition of a little wealth could thus per|vert thy judgment, and teach thee to impo&s;e on thy ma&s;ter for truth, the mon&s;trous chimeras of thy wild fancy. Thy folly be on thy head; for a little, a

very little time mu&s;t, with the unbound|ed extravagance of which thou art guilty, di&s;&s;ipate what thy friend hath left thee; and when thou art again reduced to thy former &s;tate, thou wilt be glad to &s;ue to my bounty for that which thou did&s;t lately with &s;o much arrogance re|ject. Go, unhappy Nourjahad, con|tinued he, (his voice a little &s;oftened) the remembrance of what thou once wert to me, will not permit me to &s;ee thee fall a victim to thy own de&s;perate folly. Should it be publickly known that thou ha&s;t thus endeavoured by lies and profanation to abu&s;e the credulity of thy prince, thou would&s;t find that thy boa&s;ted immortality would not be proof again&s;t that death, which he &s;hould think him&s;elf obliged, in ju&s;tice to his own
<PB N="49" REF="51">
honour and dignity, to inflict on &s;o bold an impo&s;tor. Hence, mi&s;erable man, pur&s;ued he, retire to thy hou&s;e; and if thou art not quite abondoned, endeavour by a &s;ober and regular conduct to ex|piate thy offences again&s;t heaven and thy &s;overeign; but as a puni&s;hment for thy crime, pre&s;ume not, without my leave, to &s;tir beyond the limits of thy own ha|bitation, on pain of a more rigorous and la&s;ting confinement.</P>
<P>Nourjahad, thunder-&s;truck at this unexpected &s;entence, was unable to re|ply; and the &s;ultan having ordered the captain of his guards to be called, com|mitted his pri&s;oner to his hands; telling him if he &s;uffered Nourjahad to e&s;cape, his head &s;hould an&s;wer it.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52">
Filled with re&s;entment and di&s;content, Nourjahad was conducted back to his own hou&s;e; at all the avenues of which he had the mortification to &s;ee guards po&s;ted, agreeably to the charge given by the &s;ultan.</P>
<P>He retired pen&s;ively to his clo&s;et, where, &s;hutting him&s;elf up, he now for the fir&s;t time repented of his indi&s;cre|tion in the choice he had made.</P>
<P>Unfortunate that I am, cried he, what will riches or length of days avail me, if I am thus to be mi&s;erably immured within the walls of my own dwelling? Would it not have been better for me to have reque&s;ted the genius to re&s;tore me to the favour of my prince? Schem|zeddin

always loved me, and would not fail to have promoted me to wealth and honours; mean while I &s;hould have enjoyed my liberty, which now methinks, as I am debarred of it, appears to me a greater ble&s;&s;ing than any I po&s;&s;e&s;s. Un|happy Nourjahad, what is become of all thy &s;chemes of felicity! He was even weak enough to &s;hed tears, and gave him&s;elf up to vexation for the remainder of the day.</P>
<P>His mind, however, was by plea&s;ure rendered too volatile to &s;uffer any thing to make a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on him; and he had &s;till too many re&s;ources of happine&s;s in his power, to give him&s;elf up to de&s;pair. It is true, &s;aid he, I am debarred of my liberty, but have I not

The incredulous &s;ultan, &s;atisfied with puni&s;hing me, will give him&s;elf no far|ther concern about me, provided I do not attempt to e&s;cape; and thus with|drawn from the public eye, envy will not endeavour to penetrate into the re|ce&s;&s;es of a private dwelling. I will &s;e|cure the fidelity of my &s;ervants, by my liberality towards them.

on his per&s;on, to indulge him&s;elf with an unbounded freedom in his mo&s;t volup|tuous wi&s;hes. He commanded a ban|quet to be prepared for him that night, which exceeded in luxury and profu&s;ion any of the preceding. He ordered all his women, of which he had a great number, adorned with jewels and dre&s;&s;ed in their riche&s;t habits, to attend on him whil&s;t he was at &s;upper, permitting none but Mandana the favour to &s;it down with him. The magnificence of his apart|ments were heightened by a &s;plendid illumination of a thou&s;and torches, com|po&s;ed of odoriferous gums, which ca&s;t a blaze of light that vied with the glo|ries of the &s;un. His mu&s;icians, both vocal and in&s;trumental, were ordered to exert the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of their art, and

to &s;ooth his mind with all the enchant|ing powers of harmony. Him&s;elf attired in robes, &s;uch as the kings of Per&s;ia were u&s;ed to wear, was &s;eated under a canopy of &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ue, which he had put up for the purpo&s;e; and a&s;&s;uming the pomp of an Ea&s;tern monarch, &s;uf|fered the illu&s;ion to take &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind, that if he were not before mad, he now &s;eemed to be very near di&s;traction.</P>
<P>Intoxicated with plea&s;ure, the hi&s;|torian who writes his life, affirms that this night Nourjahad for the fir&s;t time got drunk.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, it is certain that having retired to re&s;t, he &s;lept &s;ounder

<P>He called loud and often, but nobody an&s;wering him, as he was naturally cho|leric, he jumped out of bed, and &s;tep|ping ha&s;tily into the outer chamber, he found that none of the &s;laves were in waiting. Enraged at this neglect, he called &s;everal of his dome&s;tics by their names, one after another; when at length, after he was almo&s;t out of breath with pa&s;&s;ion, a female &s;lave appeared,

<P>The dam&s;el no &s;ooner perceived him, than giving a loud &s;hriek, &s;he was about to run away; when Nourjahad, pro|voked at her behaviour, catching her roughly by the arm, Where is thy mi&s;|tre&s;s, &s;aid he, and whence ari&s;es that terror and amazement in thy counte|nance? Alas! my lord, an&s;wered the &s;lave, pardon my &s;urprize, which is occa|&s;ioned by my &s;eeing you &s;o unex|pectedly.

<P>Ha&s;em, who had run in among&s;t the other dome&s;tics, took upon him to an|&s;wer for the re&s;t. It is not to be won|dered at, my lord, &s;aid he, that your &s;laves &s;eem &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing you thus
<PB N="60" REF="62">
as it were rai&s;ed from the dead; but if they are amazed, their joy doubtle&s;s is equal to their wonder; mine I am &s;ure is unutterable, to behold my lord once more re&s;tored to his faithful &s;ervants, after we had almo&s;t de&s;paired of your ever more unclo&s;ing your eyes.</P>
<P>You talk &s;trangely, &s;aid Nourjahad, a little &s;taggered at what he &s;aw and heard. He ju&s;t then recollected the terms on which he had received the important gift from the genius; and began to &s;u&s;|pect that he had endured one of tho&s;e preternatural &s;lumbers, to which he had &s;ubjected him&s;elf. How long may I have &s;lept, &s;aid he? Four years and twenty days exactly, an&s;wered Ha&s;em; I have rea&s;on to know, for I counted
<PB N="61" REF="63">
the melancholy hours as they pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;eldom quitted your bed-&s;ide. It may be &s;o, &s;aid Nourjahad, I have been &s;ubject to the&s;e trances from a boy, but this has la&s;ted rather longer than u&s;ual. He then commanded all his &s;laves to withdraw, retaining only Ha&s;em, with whom he wanted to have &s;ome di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Tell me now, &s;aid he, (when they were alone) and tell me truly, is all I have heard real, and is Mandana actually dead? Too true, my lord, replied Ha|&s;em, Mandana died in childbed, and dying left her infant &s;on to my care. Is my child alive, &s;aid Nourjahad ea|gerly? He is, my lord, an&s;wered Ha&s;em, and you &s;hall &s;ee him pre&s;ently: Man|dana
<PB N="62" REF="64">
called me to her, continued he, when &s;he found her&s;elf dying.</P>
<P>Ha&s;em, &s;aid &s;he, be careful of your lord; Heaven will one day re&s;tore him to you again. See that you manage his hou&s;ehold with the &s;ame prudence and regularity that you would if he him&s;elf were to in&s;pect into your conduct; for be a&s;&s;ured he will &s;ooner or later exact a ju&s;t account of your proceedings. Here are the keys of his coffers. I ventured to take them from under his pillow, where I knew he kept them. I have hu&s;banded his fortune with oeco|nomy, and have hitherto kept order and harmony in his family: On you it re&s;ts to pre&s;erve it in the &s;ame condition. Nourjahad will not fail to reward your
<PB N="63" REF="65">
diligence and fidelity. It is not expe|dient that any one &s;hould know the con|dition to which he is reduced. His life is governed by a &s;trange fatality. You have nothing to do therefore, but to give out that he is &s;eized with a lingering di&s;temper, which confines him to his bed. Let no impertinent enquirers &s;ee him, and all curio&s;ity about him will &s;oon cea&s;e. The&s;e, proceeded Ha&s;em, were almo&s;t the la&s;t words that my be|loved mi&s;tre&s;s &s;poke. I have punctually complied with her orders. Your condi|tion has been kept a profound &s;ecret from every one but your own family, and they all love you too well to betray their tru&s;t. Your women are all im|mured within the &s;acred walls of your &s;eraglio, and though they murmur at
<PB N="64" REF="66">
their &s;ituation, they fail not to offer up their daily prayers that Heaven would re&s;tore you to them. I will now, con|tinued he, pre&s;ent your &s;on to you; it will be &s;ome con&s;olation to you to &s;ee that charming pledge of Mandana's love. Saying this, he withdrew, but &s;oon re|turned leading in the child, who was as beautiful as a little cherub.</P>
<P>Nourjahad melted into tears at the &s;ight of him, and renewed his complaints for the lo&s;s of his adored Mandana. He &s;aw that the child's age &s;eemed to agree exactly with the account he had re|ceived; and now fully convinced of the truth of his misfortune, Oh Heaven, cried he, cla&s;ping the young boy to his bo&s;om, what would I give that my dear
<PB N="65" REF="67">
Mandana were now here to partake of the plea&s;ure I feel in this infant's care&s;&s;es; gladly would I con&s;ent to have three ages cut off from the number of my years, to have her more precious life re&s;tored. But my felicity would then be too great, and I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the de&s;tiny which I my&s;elf have cho&s;en. Prudent Ha&s;em, &s;aid he, ob&s;erving he looked &s;urpri&s;ed, thou do&s;t wonder at the words which thou ha&s;t heard me &s;peak, but I will not conceal from thee the marvellous &s;tory of my life. Thy &s;idelity and zeal de|&s;erve this confidence; be&s;ides, it is re|qui&s;ite that I &s;hould tru&s;t &s;ome di&s;creet per&s;on with my important &s;ecret, &s;ince Mandana, on who&s;e tenderne&s;s and loy|alty I could depend, is no more.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="68">
Nourjahad then acquainted Ha&s;em with the wonderful my&s;tery of his life. He did not, however, divulge the circum&s;tance of his concealed trea|&s;ure; he judged from his own heart, that it would not be altogether advi&s;able to lay &s;uch a tempting bait in the way even of the mo&s;t virtuous and &s;teady mind; but contented him&s;elf with tell|ing him that his genius con&s;tantly &s;up|plied him with riches, as his occa&s;ions required. Ha&s;em li&s;tened to him with a&s;toni&s;hment; but a&s;&s;ured him, after what had already pa&s;t, he doubted not a tittle of the truth of what he had been told, amazing and almo&s;t incredible as it appeared.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69">
My lord, &s;aid he, you may &s;ecurely rely on my zeal and diligence, &s;o long as you are plea&s;ed to entertain me in your &s;ervice. That I &s;hall do during your life, interrupted Nourjahad: But, re|plied Ha&s;em, what if one of tho&s;e un|merciful long trances &s;hould continue for a length of time much beyond that from which you are but now awakened, and that I &s;hould happen to die before you recover your &s;en&s;es, who knows in that ca&s;e what might be the con&s;e|quences? It is an accident exceedingly to be dreaded, replied Nourjahad; Hea|ven knows to what indignities I might be expo&s;ed, perhaps to be buried alive, and condemned to pa&s;s a century or two in a di&s;mal &s;epulchre. The thought makes me &s;hudder, and I almo&s;t repent
<PB N="68" REF="70">
of having accepted life on &s;uch conditions. As I have no warning, continued he, when tho&s;e fatal &s;lumbers will over|power me, (for who can always be guarded again&s;t the &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion, or what man is &s;o attentive to that imper|tinent monitor within, as to hear his whi&s;pers amid&s;t the hurry of tumultuous plea&s;ures?) As I know not, I &s;ay, when I am to be condemned to that &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, or how long I &s;hall continue in it, I can only conjure thee if I &s;hould happen to be &s;eized with another trance during thy life, (which, con&s;idering my di&s;po&s;ition, is not impo&s;&s;ible) that thou wilt ob&s;erve the &s;ame conduct which thou ha&s;t lately done; and if the angel of death &s;hould &s;ummon thee away be|fore my &s;en&s;es are loo&s;ed from their my&s;|terious
<PB N="69" REF="71">
bands, that thou wilt with thy dying breath, commit the &s;ecret to &s;ome one faithful per&s;on of my family, whom thou thinke&s;t mo&s;t fit to be relied on, for a punctual di&s;charge of their duty. As I &s;hall never part with any of my &s;er|vants, till the inevitable &s;troke of death &s;eparates them from me, and &s;hall con|&s;tantly &s;upply their places with the wor|thie&s;t per&s;ons that can be found, I think I cannot fail of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of people, from among&s;t whom, one at lea&s;t may always be found, in who&s;e &s;ecrecy and truth I may &s;afely confide.</P>
<P>Without doubt, my lord, an&s;wered Ha&s;em, you may by &s;uch wi&s;e mea&s;ures as the&s;e, be always guarded again&s;t the wor&s;t that may befal you.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="72">
Though Nourjahad had, by thus pro|viding again&s;t evil events, exceedingly relieved his mind from the fears by which it was agitated, le&s;t any ill &s;hould happen to him during his &s;lumbers; yet was his heart far from being at ea&s;e. The lo&s;s of Mandana preyed upon his &s;pirits. He had no reli&s;h for the charms of his other women. Mandana's &s;upe|rior loveline&s;s was always pre&s;ent to his eyes: The delicacies of his table grew ta&s;tele&s;s; Mandana's &s;prightly wit was wanting to give a reli&s;h to the fea&s;t. The melodious concerts of mu&s;ic with which he was wont to be &s;o delighted, now only &s;erved to overwhelm him with melancholy: Mandana's enchanting voice was not heard, which u&s;ed to &s;well his heart to rapture.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="73">
In &s;hort, for a time he took plea&s;ure in nothing but the care&s;&s;es and innocent prattle of his little &s;on, whom by his ten|derne&s;s and endearments he had taught to love him.</P>
<P>I am unhappy, my dear Ha&s;em, would he often &s;ay; the lo&s;s of Mandana im|bitters all my joys, and methinks I begin to look forward with di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>My lord, &s;aid Ha&s;em, there is nothing which has befallen you but what is com|mon to all. Every one may naturally expect to &s;ee the death of &s;ome per&s;on or other whom they love; but you who are endowed with &s;o miraculous a life mu&s;t needs look to drop a tear over a thou&s;and graves.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74">
Melancholy reflection, &s;aid Nourjahad! it occurred not to me in this light when I made my choice. I knew indeed I mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity bury hundreds of &s;ucceeding generations; but &s;aid I to my&s;elf, I &s;hall in&s;en&s;ibly contract new amities, as I per|ceive the old ones are likely to be di&s;|&s;olved by the hand of time. My heart, &s;aid I, &s;hall never feel a vacuity, for want of fit objects of de&s;ire. A new beauty will naturally take place of her who&s;e charms begin to decline; thus the ardors of love will be &s;upplied with perpetual fewel; and upon the &s;ame principle will the &s;ocial joys of friend&s;hip be unremitting. I con&s;idered the world as a flower gar|den, the product of which was to delight my &s;en&s;es for a certain &s;ea&s;on. The bloom is not made to la&s;t, thought I,
<PB N="73" REF="75">
but it will be &s;ucceeded by a fre&s;h blow, who&s;e &s;weetne&s;s and variety will equal the former, and intirely obliterate them from my memory. I thought not, alas, that before the &s;pring ended, a cruel bla&s;t might &s;uddenly de&s;troy my faire&s;t flower.</P>
<P>Would you, my lord, &s;aid Ha&s;em, if it were in your power, ab&s;olve your ge|nius from his promi&s;e, &s;eeing your life mu&s;t be perpetually &s;ubject to &s;uch mi&s;|fortunes?</P>
<P>Not &s;o neither, an&s;wered Nourjahad; time is a never-failing remedy for grief; I &s;hall get over this, and be better pre|pared again&s;t the next a&s;&s;ault of evil.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76">
In effect, Nourjahad kept his word, and &s;oon returned to his former way of living.</P>
<P>He had the mortification, however, to find him&s;elf &s;till a pri&s;oner. Ha&s;em told him that the &s;ultan had not yet taken off the re&s;traint, under which he had formerly laid him; and whether it was through forgetfulne&s;s or de&s;ign, the guards &s;till maintained their po&s;ts about his hou&s;e. This Nourjahad was him&s;elf convinced of, by &s;eeing them from his windows.</P>
<P>It is &s;trange, &s;aid he, that Schem|zeddin &s;hould retain his re&s;entment again&s;t me for &s;o long a time; e&s;pecially
<PB N="75" REF="77">
as he might have been convinced of the truth of what I a&s;&s;erted, by the extraor|dinary &s;tate in which I have lain all this while. You forget, my lord, &s;aid Ha|&s;em, that this was an ab&s;olute &s;ecret, no one from under your own roof knowing a word of the matter. Such was Man|dana's la&s;t injunctions, and your faith|ful &s;ervants never divulged a tittle of it.</P>
<P>Did not my friends come to vi&s;it me, &s;aid Nourjahad, during that interval in which I &s;lept? Tho&s;e whom you called your friends, an&s;wered Ha&s;em, came as u&s;ual, during the fir&s;t month of your dormant &s;tate; but being refu&s;ed ad|mittance, under pretence that your health was &s;o much declined, that you were
<PB N="76" REF="78">
not in a condition to receive them, they &s;oon de&s;i&s;ted from their vi&s;its; and find|ing they could no more be entertained with fea&s;ting and jollity, they have never &s;ince inquired after you.</P>
<P>Ungrateful wretches, &s;aid Nourjahad! I ca&s;t them off for ever. Yet it is an irk&s;ome thing to live without friends. You Ha&s;em are a prudent and hone&s;t man, but &s;till you are my &s;ervant; I cannot therefore con&s;ider you on that footing of equality which friend&s;hip requires. There is one man, &s;aid Ha|&s;em, who has &s;hewn him&s;elf grateful and compa&s;&s;ionate; and tho&s;e two virtues never come alone, but are ever found attended with many others. Oh name
<PB N="77" REF="79">
him, &s;aid Nourjahad. It is Zamgrad, replied Ha&s;em, that officer of the &s;ultan's whom you once obliged by a trifling pre&s;ent of a ring; he never fails &s;ending every day to enquire after your welfare. Nay, he has often called him&s;elf, and expre&s;&s;ed an hone&s;t &s;orrow for the ill &s;tate of health to which I told him you were reduced; tenderly blaming the &s;ultan for his rigorous confinement of you.</P>
<P>Worthy Zamgrad, &s;aid Nourjahad, thou, thou alone &s;halt be the cho&s;en friend of my heart; the re&s;t of my worth|le&s;s acquaintance I from this minute di&s;card.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="80">
I will write to Schemzeddin, pur&s;ued he; perhaps he may now relent and re|&s;tore me to my liberty. I long to &s;hift the &s;cene, and remove to &s;ome place where Mandana's image may not be &s;o often revived in my memory. Wert thou not, Ha&s;em, about to procure for me a noble &s;eat in the country, which I was going to take a view of that day on which the good Zamgrad came to carry me before the &s;ultan? If I might but retire thither, I &s;hould think my&s;elf happy.</P>
<P>Alas, my lord, replied Ha&s;em, that fine &s;eat cannot now be your's. You may remember I made only a condi|tional
<PB N="79" REF="81">
agreement with the owner of it, depending on your approbation of the place after your having &s;een it. I recol|lect it, &s;aid Nourjahad, but may it not &s;till be mine? By no means, an&s;wered Ha&s;em; the owner has long &s;ince di&s;|po&s;ed of it to another.</P>
<P>That is unlucky, &s;aid Nourjahad; but we can ea&s;ily find another. Be it your care to look out for one, whil&s;t I endeavour to move the &s;ultan in my fa|vour.</P>
<P>Ha&s;em was not &s;low in executing his ma&s;ter's orders. In three days he told him he had &s;een a villa, which &s;eemed to him to &s;urpa&s;s all the de&s;criptions of
<PB N="80" REF="82">
Eden in its primary &s;tate of beauty. It is but at the di&s;tance of ten leagues from Ormuz, &s;aid he. The hou&s;e and gar|dens are in compleat order, and you may purcha&s;e the whole for fifty thou|&s;and pieces of gold. The &s;ultan him|&s;elf hath not in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion any thing more delightful. I will have it, &s;aid Nourjahad: Get the money ready, you have the keys of my coffers, and they contain more than that &s;um.</P>
<P>My lord, an&s;wered Ha&s;em, when you la&s;t &s;aw them they did contain much more; but you will be plea&s;ed to recol|lect that it is above four years &s;ince, and that your hou&s;ehold has been maintained during that time; which, notwith&s;tand|ing
<PB N="81" REF="83">
I have u&s;ed the utmo&s;t oeconomy, mu&s;t needs have &s;omewhat dimini&s;hed your trea&s;ury. I had forgot, replied Nourjahad, but I will &s;oon &s;upply you with the gold you want.</P>
<P>Accordingly he paid a vi&s;it to the &s;ub|terraneous cave that very night; where finding every thing as he had left it, he loaded him&s;elf with a quantity of gold, &s;ufficient to prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of drawing from his hidden &s;tore of wealth for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>Intent now on the pur&s;uit of his plea|&s;ures, he neglected not applying to the &s;ultan for a repeal, or at lea&s;t a mitiga|tion of his &s;entence. He writ to Schem|zeddin
<PB N="82" REF="84">
a letter in terms full of humility; thinking if he could remove his incre|dulity by convincing him that the extra|ordinary fact he had related, was nothing more than the truth, that the &s;ultan would no longer deny him his liberty. He &s;crupled not to acquaint him, that he had been for more than four years in a profound &s;leep, for the confirmation of which fact, &s;trange as it might &s;eem to his maje&s;ty, he de&s;ired leave to appeal to every one of his own hou&s;ehold, and conjured the &s;ultan to take the trouble of informing him&s;elf more fully from &s;ome of his people, whom he might cau&s;e to be brought into his pre&s;ence and privately examined, as he confe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="83" REF="85">
he did not wi&s;h to have &s;o uncommon an event divulged.</P>
<P>Nourjahad from this expedient had great hopes of obtaining his de&s;ire; but the event turned out contrary to his ex|pectations.</P>
<P>Zamgrad two days after brought him an an&s;wer from the &s;ultan in writ|ing: Nourjahad laid the paper on his head, then ki&s;&s;ing the &s;eals, he broke them open, and read as follows.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>I have not been unmindful of thy motions, and I was plea&s;ed to hear from time to time, that for the&s;e four years pa&s;t, order and decency have been pre|&s;erved
<PB N="84" REF="86">
in thy dwelling. I flattered my|&s;elf that this was owing to thy having returned to a &s;en&s;e of thy duty. But my hope deceived me, when I found that Nourjahad was by a violent malady which &s;eized him (doubtle&s;s the effects of his intemperance) di&s;qualified from indulging in tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es in which he was wont to riot.</P>
<P>This vi&s;itation from heaven, I thought would have produced &s;alutary effects on thy mind, and hoped if the angel of health were again to revi&s;it thy pillow, that thou would&s;t make a different u&s;e of thy recovered &s;trength. How mu&s;t my indignation then be rou&s;ed again&s;t thee, abandoned as thou art to perdi|tion,
<PB N="85" REF="87">
to find thou per&s;i&s;te&s;t in thy enor|mous folly and wickedne&s;s; and conti|nue&s;t to abu&s;e the patience of thy bene|factor and &s;overeign ma&s;ter, with &s;uch unparalleled fal&s;ehoods. A prince le&s;s merciful than my&s;elf, would no longer delay to puni&s;h thee with death: But I give thee thy wretched life. Spend it if thou can&s;t in penitence. Nay, I will &s;o far indulge thee, as to permit thee, for the more perfect recovery of thy health, to retire to thy hou&s;e in the country; but at the peril of thy head pre&s;ume not to &s;tir beyond the bounds of thy own habitation.</P></Q></P>
<P>Nourjahad now too late found his error in endeavouring to force belief
<PB N="86" REF="88">
of a thing which appeared &s;o incredible; and wi&s;hed he had rather availed him&s;elf of the &s;ultan's prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of the &s;tory propagated by his &s;ervants, as he found that would have been the wi&s;er cour&s;e.</P>
<P>What a world is this, &s;aid he to Zam|grad, (after having read the letter) where he who ought to be the rewarder of truth, and the di&s;pen&s;er of ju&s;tice, &s;huts his ears again&s;t conviction, and condemns an innocent man for endea|vouring to &s;et him right? But I will not involve you in the puni&s;hment im|po&s;ed on my imaginary guilt, by requir|ing your belief of what I have in vain
<PB N="87" REF="89">
endeavoured to convince the incredulous Schemzeddin.</P>
<P>I know not, my lord, replied Zam|grad, what has pa&s;&s;ed between the &s;ultan and you; of this only I am certain, that he &s;eems exceedingly enraged again&s;t you. I would it were in my power, from the re&s;pect I bear you, to mitigate his re&s;entment.</P>
<P>I thank thee, gentle Zamgrad, &s;aid Nourjahad; I find thou, of all my numerous acquaintance, art the only man who has &s;hewn any attachment to me. If the friend&s;hip of one labouring under the di&s;plea&s;ure of his prince, be worth thy accepting, I offer thee mine, and
<PB N="88" REF="90">
conjure thee to grant me yours in return. The ba&s;e ingratitude I have already ex|perienced from the re&s;t of my pretended friends, has determined me to di&s;claim all &s;ociety with them: if thou wilt &s;ome|times vi&s;it me in my retirement, thou wilt find Nourjahad not unde&s;erving of thy kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Zamgrad promi&s;ed to &s;ee him as often as he could, and took his leave.</P>
<P>However vexed Nourjahad was at his di&s;appointment, in finding him&s;elf, by being &s;till debarred of his liberty, de|prived for a time at lea&s;t from executing one of his favourite purpo&s;es, that of travelling all over the world, he yet
<PB N="89" REF="91">
contented him&s;elf with the reflection, that this project was only po&s;tponed to another opportunity; and that he &s;hould have time enough for executing his de|&s;ign, after Schemzeddin, and many of his po&s;terity were in their graves. I will not wa&s;te my hours, &s;aid he, in fruitle&s;s langui&s;hment for what I cannot at pre&s;ent attain, but make the mo&s;t of the good which now offers it&s;elf to my acceptance.</P>
<P>He ordered Ha&s;em to pay down the money forthwith, for that fine &s;eat: I will remove thither, &s;aid he, imme|diately; and make my&s;elf &s;ome recom|pence by all the means that art can de|vi&s;e, for that cruel long trance, which
<PB N="90" REF="92">
overpowered me &s;o un&s;ea&s;onably: I hope I &s;hall not be vi&s;ited by another for the&s;e fifty or &s;ixty years at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Ha&s;em's diligence kept pace with his lord's impatience: He got every thing in readine&s;s for his reception at his rural man&s;ion: and to avoid the notice which might be taken of &s;o numerous a &s;era|glio, and &s;uch a train of dome&s;tics, the prudent Ha&s;em advi&s;ed that they &s;hould &s;et out and travel by night. This pre|caution, &s;aid he, will prevent the malice of your enemies from making ill-natured repre&s;entations of your conduct to the &s;ultan; and as you your&s;elf are &s;uppo&s;ed by every body in Ormuz to have la|boured under a long and painful illne&s;s,
<PB N="91" REF="93">
I think, to give colour to this report, it would be mo&s;t advi&s;able for you to be carried in a litter. As Nourjahad loved his ea&s;e, he readily enough con&s;ented to this propo&s;al, and in this manner &s;uf|fered him&s;elf to be conveyed to his new habitation.</P>
<P>On his arrival he found Ha&s;em had not exaggerated in his de&s;cription of this place. The hou&s;e, or rather palace, for &s;uch it might be called, infinitely ex|ceeded his expectations; but above all, the gardens were &s;o delicious, that his &s;en&s;es were ravi&s;hed with delight. He declared that tho&s;e man&s;ions of joy pre|pared for the reception of the faithful, could not exceed them; and forgetting
<PB N="92" REF="94">
that this paradi&s;e was to be his pri&s;on, he ordered that a pavilion of light brocade &s;hould be reared for him in the mid&s;t of his garden, where he purpo&s;ed to enjoy the cool hours of the evening, amid&s;t the noi&s;e of falling waters, and the wild notes of innumerable birds, who had taken up their re&s;idence in this terre&s;trial paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>Behold him now once more, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every thing, for which the heart of man in the wilde&s;t wi&s;hes of Epicurean phrenzy, could pant. He gave the reins to his pa&s;&s;ions; he again became the &s;lave of voluptuous appe|tites: He &s;ubmitted a &s;econd time to the power of beauty; he invented new
<PB N="93" REF="95">
modes of luxury; and his delightful abode became the &s;cene of every licen|tious plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The delicacies and profu&s;ion in which he him&s;elf wallowed, made him forget that there were wants or mi&s;eries among&s;t his fellow-creatures; and as he had but little intercour&s;e with mankind, except with tho&s;e who flattered his fol|lies, or admini&s;tered to his loo&s;e plea|&s;ures, he became hardened to all the &s;ocial affections. He cea&s;ed to relieve the poor, becau&s;e they never came in his way; and with a heart naturally generous and benevolent, he lived only for him|&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="96">
Immer&s;ed in &s;en&s;ual gratifications, he lo&s;t all reli&s;h for any others. The poets and &s;ages whom he entertained in his hou&s;e, began to grow irk&s;ome to him. He derided the wi&s;dom and philo&s;ophy of the latter; and if they attempted to entertain him with learned or grave di&s;|cour&s;es, he laughed at them; and at length thinking their company tedious, he turned them out of his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>His bards would have &s;hared the &s;ame fate, if they had not by a timely addre&s;s rendered their art &s;ub&s;ervient to his depraved inclinations. They com|po&s;ed nothing but pieces filled with adulation on him&s;elf, or light ver&s;es in
<PB N="95" REF="97">
prai&s;e of one or other of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; the&s;e were &s;et to melting airs, and &s;ung accompanied by the lute.</P>
<P>Thus did Nourjahad pa&s;s his days. Every ri&s;ing &s;un beheld &s;ome fre&s;h out|rage on the laws of temperance and de|cency; and the &s;hades of every night de&s;cended on his unatoned offences.</P>
<P>The delightful &s;ea&s;on of the year, winged with plea&s;ures, was now almo&s;t fled, when one of the mo&s;t extravagant projects came into the head of Nourja|had, that ever entered the imagination of man.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="98">
As the gardens of his palace were exceedingly delicious, he vainly fancied that they mu&s;t be very like the regions of paradi&s;e (where all good Mu&s;&s;ulmen are received after death) and that in order to make the re&s;emblance perfectly complete, he would cau&s;e the women of his &s;eraglio to per&s;onate the Houriis; tho&s;e beautiful virgins who are given as a reward to all true believers. He him|&s;elf would needs repre&s;ent Mahomet; and one of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es whom he loved be&s;t, and who was indeed the hand&s;ome&s;t of them, he would have to appear under the name and character of Cadiga, the favourite wife of the great Prophet.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="99">
The idea, wild and profane as it was, was notwith&s;tanding readily adopted by all the people about him, no one pre|&s;uming to di&s;pute his will. Nor were the women on this occa&s;ion much in|clined to do &s;o, as it &s;erved them for a very agreeable amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Some debates however aro&s;e among&s;t them on account of the dre&s;&s;es proper to be worn on this occa&s;ion; as none of them remembered to have read in the Koran what &s;ort of habits the Houriis wore; and &s;ome of the ladies gave it as their opinion that tho&s;e beauties went naked.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="100">
After many di&s;putes on the &s;ubject, however, they &s;truck a &s;ort of medium, and agreed to be attired in loo&s;e robes of the thinne&s;t Per&s;ian gauze, with chap|lets of flowers on their heads.</P>
<P>Nourjahad approved of the invention, and gave orders to Ha&s;em to prepare for this cele&s;tial ma&s;querade, with all po&s;&s;ible diligence; charging him to leave no|thing out, that could render the enter|tainment worthy of Mahomet him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Neither art nor expence were &s;pared on this extraordinary occa&s;ion. He gave commandment that the fountains which adorned his garden &s;hould be &s;o con|trived,
<PB N="99" REF="101">
that in&s;tead of water, they &s;hould pour forth milk and wine; that the &s;ea|&s;ons &s;hould be anticipated, and the early fragrance of the &s;pring &s;hould be united with the more vivid colours of the glowing &s;ummer. In &s;hort, that fruits, blo&s;&s;oms, and flowers, &s;hould at once unite their various beauties, to imbelli&s;h this terre&s;trial paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>The diligence of Ha&s;em was &s;o active, that every thing was got in readine&s;s, even &s;ooner than Nourjahad expected. He de&s;cended into his garden to take a &s;urvey of the&s;e wondrous preparations; and finding all exactly to his mind, he gave orders to his women to hold them|&s;elves
<PB N="100" REF="102">
prepared to act their parts; telling them that on that very evening he would give them a foreta&s;te of the ravi&s;hing plea&s;ures they were to enjoy, in the happy regions of light.</P>
<P>The weather was extremely hot, and Nourjahad, in order to take a view of the magnificent decorations, having fatigued him&s;elf with wandering through his ely&s;ium, retired to his apartment, and threw him&s;elf down on a &s;opha, with intent to take a &s;hort repo&s;e, the better to prepare him&s;elf for the exce&s;&s;es of the night: leaving orders with Ha&s;em and Cadiga to awake him from &s;leep before &s;un&s;et.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="103">
Nourjahad, however, opened his eyes without any one's having rou&s;ed him from his &s;lumbers; when perceiving that the day was almo&s;t clo&s;ed, and finding that his commands had been neglected, he flew into a violent pa&s;&s;ion, &s;u&s;pecting that his women had prevailed on Ha&s;em, to grant them this opportunity whil&s;t he he &s;lept, of indulging them&s;elves in liberties without that re&s;traint to which they were accu&s;tomed in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Enraged at the thought, he re&s;olved to have them called before him, and after &s;everely reprimanding them, and puni&s;hing Ha&s;em proportionally to his fault, to have his women all locked up,
<PB N="102" REF="104">
and po&s;tpone his fe&s;tivity till he was in a better humour to reli&s;h it.</P>
<P>Impatient, and even furious at his di&s;|appointment, he &s;tamped on the floor with his foot; when immediately a black eunuch pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the door. Go, &s;aid he, his words almo&s;t choaked with indignation, go and bid my women one and all ha&s;ten directly into my pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>The &s;lave retired in re&s;pectful &s;ilence; and pre&s;ently after all the ladies of his &s;eraglio entered his apartment. They were, according to the cu&s;tom, covered with vails, but on appearing in their
<PB N="103" REF="105">
lord's pre&s;ence, they threw them off. But, Oh Heaven! what was Nourjahad's anger and a&s;toni&s;hment, when in&s;tead of the beautiful Houriis whom he expected to &s;ee, to behold a train of wrinkled and deformed old hags.</P>
<P>Amazement and rage for a while &s;u&s;|pended the power of &s;peech: When the foremo&s;t of the old women approaching, and offering to embrace him, he thru&s;t her rudely from him: Dete&s;table fiend, &s;aid he, whence this pre&s;umption? where are my &s;laves? Where is Ha&s;em? and the women of my &s;eraglio? The trai|tore&s;&s;es! they &s;hall pay dearly for thus abu&s;ing my indulgence.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="106">
The old women at this all fell upon their faces to the ground; but the fir&s;t who had advanced addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to &s;peak, Avaunt! cried Nourjahad, be|gone wretches, and rid my &s;ight of &s;uch hideous a&s;pects.</P>
<P>Alas, my lord, replied the old woman, have you intirely forgot me? has time left no traces to remind you of your once beloved Cadiga? Cadiga! thou Cadiga? do not provoke me, &s;aid Nour|jahad, or by Allah I'll &s;purn thee with my foot.</P>
<P>The old women now all &s;et up a la|mentable cry, Mi&s;erable wretches that
<PB N="105" REF="107">
we are, &s;aid they, beating their withered brea&s;ts, it had been happy for us if we had all died in our youth, rather than have thus out-lived our lord's affections!</P>
<P>Evil betide ye, &s;aid Nourjahad, who in the name of deformity are ye all? Hereupon the beldames cried out with one voice, Your mi&s;tre&s;&s;es! the once admired and loved partners of your bed, but the relentle&s;s hand of time has made &s;uch cruel ravage on our charms, that we do not wonder thou &s;hould&s;t find it impo&s;&s;ible to recollect us.</P>
<P>Nourjahad now began to &s;u&s;pect that he had been over-powered by a &s;econd
<PB N="106" REF="108">
trance. Why, how long, in the devil's name, have I then flept, &s;aid he?</P>
<P>Forty years and eleven moons, an|&s;wered the lady who called her&s;elf Ca|diga. Thou lie&s;t, I am &s;ure, &s;aid Nour|jahad, for it appears to me but as ye&s;ter|day &s;ince I ordered thee (if thou really art Cadiga) to awake me at a certain hour, that I might enjoy the glorious entertainment prepared for me in the gardens of the Houriis.</P>
<P>I do remember it, &s;aid Cadiga, and we your faithful &s;laves were to per&s;onate tho&s;e beautiful virgins. Alas, alas, we are not now fit to repre&s;ent tho&s;e daugh|ters
<PB N="107" REF="109">
of paradi&s;e! Thou art fitter, &s;aid Nourjahad, to repre&s;ent the furies. I tell thee again, it cannot be many hours &s;ince I fir&s;t fell into a &s;lumber.</P>
<P>It may well &s;eem &s;o, an&s;wered Cadiga, buried as your &s;en&s;es have been in for|getfulne&s;s, and every faculty con&s;igned to oblivion, that the interval of time &s;o pa&s;t mu&s;t be quite annihilated; yet it is mo&s;t certain that you have &s;lept as long as I tell you.</P>
<P>Nourjahad upon this examined the faces of the old women one after the other, but finding them &s;o totally differ|ent from what they once were, he &s;wore that he did not believe a word they &s;aid.
<PB N="108" REF="110">
Thou Cadiga! &s;aid he, the black-browed Cadiga, who&s;e enchanting &s;miles be|guiled all hearts; thou art wonderou&s;ly like her I confe&s;s!</P>
<P>Yet that I am that identical fair one, an&s;wered &s;he, I &s;hall be able to convince you, from a remarkable &s;ignature which I bear on my bo&s;om, and which &s;till remains, though the re&s;t of my per&s;on is &s;o entirely changed.</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he uncovered her brea&s;t, on which the figure of a ro&s;e-bud was delineated by the hand of nature. Nour|jahad well remembered the mark; he had once thought it a beauty, and made it the &s;ubject of an amorous &s;onnet,
<PB N="109" REF="111">
when the bo&s;om of the fair Cadiga was as white and as &s;mooth as alaba&s;ter.</P>
<P>Convinced by this proof, that the&s;e women were really what they pretended to be, Nourjahad could not conceal his vexation. By the Temple of Mecca, &s;aid he, this genius of mine is no better than he &s;hould be, and I begin to &s;u&s;|pect he is little le&s;s than an evil &s;pirit, or he could not thus take delight in per&s;ecuting me for nothing.</P>
<P>Ah, my lord, &s;aid Cadiga, I am not ignorant of the &s;trange fate by which your life is governed. Ha&s;em, your faithful Ha&s;em, communicated the &s;ecret to me with his dying breath. Is Ha&s;em
<PB N="110" REF="112">
dead, cried Nourjahad? He is, my lord, an&s;wered Cadiga, and &s;o is the worthy Zamgrad. What is become of my &s;on, &s;aid Nourjahad? I hope he has not &s;hared the &s;ame fate. It were better that he had, replied Cadiga, for it is now &s;ome five and twenty years &s;ince he ran away from the governor in who&s;e hands the wi&s;e Ha&s;em had placed him for his education; and having in vain endea|voured to prevail on that hone&s;t man to bury you, that giving out you were decea&s;ed, he might take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all your wealth, finding he could not &s;uc|ceed in his unnatural de&s;ign, he took an opportunity of breaking open your ca|binet, and &s;ecuring all the trea&s;ure he could find, &s;tole &s;ecretly away, and has never been heard of &s;ince.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="113">
Ungrateful viper! exclaimed Nour|jahad; and thou cruel genius, thus to imbitter a life, which was thy own voluntary gift; for thou came&s;t to me una&s;ked.</P>
<P>Had not, proceeded Cadiga, my&s;elf and the re&s;t of your women con&s;ented to give up all our jewels to Ha&s;em, who turned them into money, we mu&s;t long ere this have been reduced to want; for your unworthy &s;on &s;tripped you of all your wealth; but Ha&s;em conducted every thing with the &s;ame regularity and care as if you had been awake, di&s;charg|ing &s;uch of your dome&s;tics as he thought unnece&s;&s;ary, and replacing &s;uch as died in your &s;ervice; and it is not many days
<PB N="112" REF="114">
&s;ince the good old man was him&s;elf &s;ummoned away by the angel of death.</P>
<P>Tell me, &s;aid Nourjahad, does Schem|zeddin &s;till live?</P>
<P>He does, replied Cadiga, but bend|ing under the weight of age and infir|mities, he is become &s;o intolerably peevi&s;h that no one dares &s;peak to him. Indeed he is at times &s;o fanta&s;tical and perver&s;e, that it is &s;ecretly whi&s;pered he is not perfectly in his &s;en&s;es. It may very well be, &s;aid Nourjahad, that he is doating by this time, for he cannot be much le&s;s than &s;eventy years old. The genius has in this article been faithful to his promi&s;e; for I, though nearly of the
<PB N="113" REF="115">
&s;ame age, find my&s;elf as vigorous and healthy as ever, but I give him little thanks for this, &s;eeing he has defrauded me of &s;uch an uncon&s;cionable portion of my life.</P>
<P>My lord, &s;aid Cadiga, there is one cir|cum&s;tance which may in &s;ome mea&s;ure reconcile you to what has already hap|pened. You know, by the &s;everity of the &s;ultan, you have been the greate&s;t part of your days a pri&s;oner; which condition, however it might have been alleviated by the plea&s;ures which &s;ur|rounded you, mu&s;t neverthele&s;s have by this time grown exceedingly irk&s;ome, had you all the while been &s;en&s;ible of your re&s;traint; and you would now pro|bably
<PB N="114" REF="116">
have been &s;o palled with the repe|tition of the &s;ame enjoyments, that I know not whether your good genius, has not, in&s;tead of cruelty, &s;hewn an extreme indulgence, in rendering you for &s;uch a number of years uncon&s;cious of your misfortune; e&s;pecially as the &s;ultan, by what I learnt from Ha&s;em, has, notwith&s;tanding the length of time &s;ince he fir&s;t deprived you of your li|berty, never rever&s;ed the barbarous &s;en|tence.</P>
<P>What thou ha&s;t &s;aid, has &s;ome colour, replied Nourjahad, and I am very much inclined to think thou ha&s;t hit upon the truth. Sage Cadiga, pur&s;ued he, what thou ha&s;t lo&s;t in beauty, thou ha&s;t gained
<PB N="115" REF="117">
in wi&s;dom; and though I can no longer regard thee with tenderne&s;s, I will &s;till retain thee in my &s;ervice, and con&s;titute thee governe&s;s over my female &s;laves; for I mu&s;t have my &s;eraglio &s;upplied with a new race of beauties. For the re&s;t of tho&s;e hags, as I do not know of any thing they are now good for, I de|&s;ire to &s;ee them no more. Be gone, &s;aid he to them, I &s;hall give orders to Cadiga concerning you.</P>
<P>When Nourjahad was left alone, he began &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect on his con|dition. How unhappy I am, &s;aid he, thus to find my&s;elf at once deprived of every thing that was dear to me; my two faithful friends, Ha&s;em and Zam|grad,
<PB N="116" REF="118">
all the blooming beauties of my &s;eraglio, who u&s;ed to delight my eyes; but above all, my &s;on, who&s;e ingratitude and cruelty pierces me more deeply than all my other lo&s;&s;es; and that rigid &s;pirit who pre&s;ides over my life, to take ad|vantage of tho&s;e hours of in&s;en&s;ibility, to deprive me of all my comforts! Yet why do I reproach my protector for that? the &s;ame ills might have befallen me, had the progre&s;s of my life been con|ducted by the common laws of nature. I mu&s;t have &s;een the death of my friends, and they might po&s;&s;ibly have been &s;natched from me in a manner equally &s;udden and &s;urpri&s;ing as their lo&s;s now appears.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="119">
My women, had I &s;een them every day, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily by this time have grown old and di&s;gu&s;tful to me; and I &s;hould certainly before now, have di&s;|carded two or three generations of beau|ties. My &s;on too, would, in his heart, have been the &s;ame thankle&s;s and per|fidious creature that he has now &s;hewn him&s;elf, had the eye of watchful autho|rity been con&s;tantly open on his conduct; and there is only this difference perhaps, between me and every other parent, that I have lived to &s;ee my offspring tramp|ling on filial duty, riotou&s;ly &s;eizing on my wealth, leaving my family to poverty, and not &s;o much as be&s;towing a grateful thought on him who gave him being, and by who&s;e &s;poils he is enriched;
<PB N="118" REF="120">
whil&s;t other fathers, deceived by a &s;pe|cious out&s;ide, in the full per&s;ua&s;ion of the piety, ju&s;tice, and affection of their children, have de&s;cended to the grave in peace, whil&s;t their heirs, with as little remor&s;e as my gracele&s;s child, have laughed at their memories.</P>
<P>I &s;ee it is in vain, proceeded he, to e&s;cape the mi&s;eries that are allotted to human life. Fool that I was to &s;ubject my&s;elf to them more by ten thou&s;and fold than any other can po&s;&s;ibly expe|rience! But &s;top, Nourjahad, how weak are thy complaints? thou knowe&s;t the conditions of thy exi&s;tence, and that thou mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity behold the decay and di&s;&s;olution of every thing that is
<PB N="119" REF="121">
mortal; take comfort then, and do not imbitter thy days by melancholy reflec|tions, but re&s;olve for the future to let no events di&s;turb thy peace, &s;eize every fleeting joy as it pa&s;&s;es, and let variety be thy heaven, for thou fee&s;t there is nothing permanent.</P>
<P>As Nourjahad was never u&s;ed, but on occa&s;ions of di&s;tre&s;s, to make u&s;e of his rea&s;on or philo&s;ophy, he no fooner found an alleviation of the evil, than he put them both to flight, as impertinent in|truders. He did not therefore long di&s;turb him&s;elf with di&s;agreeable reflec|tions, but re&s;olved as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to return to tho&s;e plea&s;ures which he
<PB N="120" REF="122">
thought con&s;tituted the felicity of man's life.</P>
<P>He gave him&s;elf but little concern about tho&s;e trea&s;ures of which his &s;on had robbed him, knowing he had an inexhau&s;tible fund of wealth, of which, agreeably to the genius's promi&s;e, he could not be deprived.</P>
<P>From Cadiga he learnt that his hou&s;e at Ormuz was in the &s;ame condition he had left it; Ha&s;em having taken care to place a diligent and faithful &s;ervant there, on whom he might rely with equal &s;ecurity as on him&s;elf; and he had the farther precaution, added Cadiga, not
<PB N="121" REF="123">
long before his death, to &s;olicit, through Zamgrad's means, the &s;ultan's permi&s;|&s;ion for your return thither. This, &s;aid he, may be nece&s;&s;ary in ca&s;e our lord awakes before Schemzeddin's decea&s;e, and &s;hould have a de&s;ire to quit this place, he may do it without the trouble of a fre&s;h application.</P>
<P>And has the &s;ultan granted this, cried Nourjahad?</P>
<P>He has, an&s;wered Cadiga, as a matter of great indulgence: for having, as he &s;aid, heard that your profu&s;ion was un|bounded, finding there were no hopes of reclaiming you, he had determined to confine you for the remainder of your
<PB N="122" REF="124">
life, with this liberty however, that you might make choice either of this palace or your hou&s;e at Ormuz for your pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Fool, cried Nourjahad, he little ima|gines how impotent are his threats, when he &s;peaks of confining me for life! I would however <HI>he</HI> were dead, that I might be rid of this irk&s;ome re&s;traint; but it cannot la&s;t much longer, for the days of Schemzeddin mu&s;t needs draw towards a period. I will not, mean while, be&s;tow any farther thought on him, but avail my&s;elf of that liberty which he has allowed me, and return to Ormuz; for I am weary of this &s;olitude, &s;eeing I have lo&s;t every thing that could render my retirement agreeable.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="125">

<P>Be it &s;o, &s;aid Nourjahad, I leave the conduct of every thing to thee; if I ap|prove of the dam&s;els, I &s;hall not &s;cruple at any price for their purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>The day being come for his return to Ormuz, full of plea&s;ing eagerne&s;s to be|hold the divine creatures which he was told waited his arrival, he &s;et out with a &s;plendid equipage, but had the morti|fication to behold his chariot &s;urrounded by a party of the &s;ultan's guards, with drawn &s;abres in their hands, to repre&s;s
<PB N="125" REF="127">
the curio&s;ity of tho&s;e who might ap|proach the chariot, to gaze at the per&s;on who was conducted in &s;o unu&s;ual a man|ner.</P>
<P>I could well excu&s;e this part of my retinue, &s;aid Nourjahad, as he pa&s;&s;ed along, but there is no re&s;i&s;ting the com|mands of this whim&s;ical old fellow Schemzeddin. Being thus conducted to his hou&s;e, the guards as before po&s;ted them&s;elves round it.</P>
<P>However chagrined Nourjahad was at this circum&s;tance, he was re&s;olved it &s;hould not interrupt his plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>He found the young &s;laves whom Cadiga had prepared all waiting his
<PB N="126" REF="128">
arrival. They were richly cloathed, and &s;tanding together in a row, in a long gallery through which he was to pa&s;s. On his entering, the merchant to whom they belonged, ordered the women to unvail.</P>
<P>Nourjahad examined them one after the other, but none of them plea&s;ed him. One had features too large, and another's were too &s;mall; the com|plexion of this was not brilliant, and the air of that wanted &s;oftne&s;s; this dam&s;el was too tall, and the next was ill pro|portioned.</P>
<P>Do&s;t thou call the&s;e beauties, &s;aid Nourjahad, angrily? By my life they

are a pack of as awkward dam&s;els as ever I beheld.</P>
<P>Surely, my lord, cried the merchant, you do not &s;peak as you think. The&s;e young maids are allowed by all good judges to be the mo&s;t perfect beauties that ever were &s;een in Per&s;ia: The &s;ultan him&s;elf has none equal to them in his &s;eraglio.</P>
<P>I tell thee, man, &s;aid Nourjahad, they are not worthy even to wait on tho&s;e of whom I my&s;elf was formerly ma&s;ter. I know not that, my lord, an&s;wered the merchant, but this I am &s;ure of, that I can have any &s;um which I &s;hall demand for their purcha&s;e. Then thou mu&s;t
<PB N="128" REF="130">
carry them to &s;ome other market, cried Nourjahad, for to me they appear &s;it for nothing but &s;laves.</P>
<P>Cadiga, who was pre&s;ent, now taking Nourjahad a&s;ide, &s;aid, The&s;e, my lord, the&s;e dam&s;els are le&s;s charming than tho&s;e of which you were formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, but the ta&s;te for beauty is quite altered &s;ince that time: You may a&s;&s;ure your|&s;elf that none will be offered to your acceptance that will exceed the&s;e. Were I and my companions, whom you once &s;o much admired, to be re&s;tored to our youth again, we &s;hould not now be looked upon; &s;uch is the fanta&s;tic turn of the age.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="131">
If this be &s;o, &s;aid Nourjahad, I &s;hall be very unfa&s;hionable in my amours; for the pre&s;ent, however, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with &s;ome of the mo&s;t tolerable of the&s;e maidens, till I have time and opportunity of &s;upplying my&s;elf with better.</P>
<P>Saying this, he &s;elected half a dozen of tho&s;e young &s;laves, whom he thought the mo&s;t agreeable, and having paid the merchant what he demanded for them, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Nourjahad having now once more e&s;tabli&s;hed his hou&s;ehold, and perceiving that the&s;e dam&s;els upon a longer ac|quaintance were really amiable, expected
<PB N="130" REF="132">
to find him&s;elf re&s;tored to his former contentment and alacrity of &s;pirits. But in this he was deceived. He was &s;eized with a la&s;&s;itude that rendered his days tire&s;ome. The vacancy he found in his heart was in&s;upportable. Surrounded by new faces, he &s;aw nobody for whom he could entertain either love or friend|&s;hip. This is a comfortle&s;s life, would he exclaim to him&s;elf, yet how often, during the date of my exi&s;tence, mu&s;t this &s;ituation, melancholy as it is, recur to me. A friend &s;hall no &s;ooner be en|deared to me by long experience of kindne&s;s and fidelity, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould regard him; than death will deprive me of him, as it has already done of Ha&s;em and Zamgrad;
<PB N="131" REF="133">
and how many bright eyes am I doomed to &s;ee for ever clo&s;ed, or what is as mor|tifying to behold, their faded lu&s;tre. There is but one way, &s;aid he, to guard again&s;t tho&s;e evils: I will no more con|tract friend&s;hips among&s;t men, nor ever again &s;uffer my mind to be &s;ubdued by female charms. I will confound all di&s;|tinction by variety, nor permit one wo|man to engro&s;s my heart; for I find by &s;ad experience, even after &s;uch an amazing length of time, that the bare idea of my dear Mandana, in&s;pires me with more tenderne&s;s, than ever I expe|rienced from the fonde&s;t blandi&s;hments of all the beauties I have &s;ince po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="134">
Nourjahad endeavoured to bani&s;h tho&s;e melancholy thoughts by others more agreeable; but he had no re&s;ources within him&s;elf. He had nothing to reflect on, from which he could derive any &s;atisfaction. My life, &s;aid he, ap|pears like a dream of plea&s;ure, that has pa&s;&s;ed away without leaving any &s;ub|&s;tantial effects: and I am even already weary of it, though in fact, notwith|&s;tanding my advanced age, I have en|joyed it but a &s;hort time, dating from that period whence my immortality com|menced.</P>
<P>He tried to read to divert his di&s;tem|pered thoughts; but from books he
<PB N="133" REF="135">
could receive no entertainment. If he turned over the pages of philo&s;ophers, morali&s;ts, or expounders of the my&s;|teries of his religion, What have I to do with thy tedious le&s;&s;ons, or dry pre|cepts, &s;aid he? Thou write&s;t to men like thy&s;elf, &s;ubject to mortality; thou teache&s;t them how to live, that they may learn how to die; but what is this to me? as I am not &s;ubject to the latter, thy advice can be of little u&s;e to me in regard to the former.</P>
<P>He had next recour&s;e to the poets; but their works gave him as little plea|&s;ure as the others. Ab&s;orbed as he had been in the gro&s;&s;er plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, he had lo&s;t tho&s;e fine feelings, which con|&s;titute
<PB N="134" REF="136">
that delicate and plea&s;ing per|ception we have, of &s;uch images, as are addre&s;&s;ed to the heart. He knew the fallacy and even e&s;&s;ence of all &s;en&s;ual enjoyments; and to the mo&s;t warm de|&s;criptions of love, and the mo&s;t pathetic pictures of grief he was equally in&s;en|&s;ible.</P>
<P>Poor wretches, &s;aid he, on reading a fine elegy written by a lover on the death of his mi&s;tre&s;s, doomed as thou wert to a &s;hort &s;pan of life, and a narrow circle of enjoyments, thou magnifie&s;t every thing within thy confined &s;phere. One &s;ingle object having engro&s;&s;ed thy whole heart, and in&s;pired thee with tran&s;ports, thou do&s;t immortalize her

<P>When he read of the death of heroes and kings, and the de&s;truction of cities, or the revolution of empires, How cir|cum&s;cribed, &s;aid he, is the knowledge of a paltry hi&s;torian!

<P>The accounts of travellers, de&s;crip|tions of the manners and cu&s;toms of va|rious countries, and books of geography, afforded him a little more entertainment. All the&s;e places, &s;aid he, I &s;hall vi&s;it in my own proper per&s;on, and &s;hall then

<P>Whil&s;t he endeavoured to fill up the vacuity he found in his mind, his time was &s;pent at be&s;t but in a &s;ort of in&s;ipid tranquillity. The voluptuary has no ta&s;te for mental plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>He every now and then returned to his former exce&s;&s;es, but he had not the &s;ame reli&s;h for them as before. Satiety &s;ucceeded every enjoyment. In vain did his &s;laves torture their invention to procure new delights for him. The powers of luxury were exhau&s;ted, and his appetites palled with abundance.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="140">
He grew peevi&s;h, moro&s;e, tyrannical; cruelty took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his brea&s;t; he abu&s;ed his women and beat his &s;laves, and &s;eemed to enjoy no &s;atisfaction but that of tormenting others.</P>
<P>In vain did the prudent Cadiga, who had &s;till &s;ome little influence over him, expo&s;tulate with him on the enormity of his behaviour.</P>
<P>How dare&s;t thou, &s;aid he, pre&s;ume to dictate to thy ma&s;ter, or to cen&s;ure his conduct! To whom am I accountable for my actions? To God and our pro|phet, an&s;wered Cadiga, with a boldne&s;s that provoked Nourjahad's wrath. Thou

lie&s;t, &s;aid he, as I am exempt from death, I never can be brought to judgment, what then have I to fear from the re&s;ent|ment, or hope from the favour of the powers whom thou name&s;t?</P>
<P>But ha&s;t thou no regard, &s;aid Cadiga, for the laws of &s;ociety, nor pity for the &s;ufferings of thy fellow creatures, whom thou make&s;t to groan every day under thy cruelty?</P>
<P>Fooli&s;h woman, &s;aid Nourjahad, do&s;t thou talk to me of laws, who think my|&s;elf bound by none. Civil and religious laws are &s;o interwoven, that you cannot pluck out a &s;ingle thread without &s;poil|ing the whole texture, and if I cut the
<PB N="140" REF="142">
woof, thinke&s;t thou that I will &s;pare the weft, when I can do it with impunity? The privilege of immortality which I enjoy, would be be&s;towed on me to lit|tle purpo&s;e, if I were to &s;uffer the weak prejudices of religion, in which I am no way concerned, to check me in any of my pur&s;uits. And what can the feeble laws of man do? My life they cannot reach. Yet thou art a pri&s;oner notwith&s;tanding, an&s;wered Cadiga. True, replied Nour|jahad, but even in my confinements I have &s;urfeited with delights. Schem|zeddin's death mu&s;t &s;oon give me that liberty, which con&s;idering the race of uncontrouled freedom I have before me, I do not now think worth attempting. I &s;hall then expatiate freely all over the
<PB N="141" REF="143">
globe; mean while I tell thee, woman, I am weary of the dull round of reiter|ated enjoyments which are provided for me; my &s;en&s;ual appetites are cloyed, I have no ta&s;te for intellectual plea&s;ures, and I mu&s;t have recour&s;e to tho&s;e which gratify the malevolent pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Thou art not fit to live, cried Cadiga, with a warmth of which &s;he had cau&s;e to repent; for Nourjahad, enraged at her reply, plucked a poniard from his girdle, Go tell thy prophet &s;o, &s;aid he, and plunged it into the &s;ide of the un|fortunate &s;lave, who fell at his feet wel|tering in blood.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="144">
The brutal Nourjahad, &s;o far from being moved with this &s;pectacle, turned from her with indifference, and quitting the chamber, entered the apartments of his women, to whom with barbarous mirth he related what he had done.</P>
<P>Though he had now lo&s;t all reli&s;h for delicate plea&s;ures, or even for the more gro&s;s enjoyments of &s;en&s;e, he neverthe|le&s;s indulged him&s;elf in them to exce&s;s; and knowing he was not accountable to any one for the death of his &s;lave, he thought no more of Cadiga; but after a day &s;pent in extravagant debauchery &s;unk to repo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145">
But his eyes were opened to a differ|ent &s;cene from that on which he had clo&s;ed them. He no &s;ooner awoke than he perceived a man &s;itting at his bed's|foot, who &s;eemed to be plunged in &s;or|row; he leaned pen&s;ively on his arm, holding a handkerchief before his eyes.</P>
<P>What mockery is this, &s;aid Nourjahad, did&s;t thou &s;uppo&s;e me dead, and art thou come to mourn over me?</P>
<P>Not &s;o, my lord, replied the man, I knew that you &s;till lived; but the &s;ultan is dead, the good Schemzeddin is no more! I am glad of it, replied Nour|jahad, I &s;hall now obtain my liberty. Who then is to reign in Ormuz?
<PB N="144" REF="146">
Doubtle&s;s, my lord, an&s;wered the man, the prince Schemerzad, the elde&s;t &s;on of Schemzeddin. Thou rave&s;t, cried Nourjahad, Schemzeddin has no &s;on. Pardon me, my lord, &s;aid the man, the &s;ultana Nourmahal was delivered of this prince the very hour on which the un|fortunate Cadiga died by your hand. Thou art in&s;olent, replied Nourjahad, to mention that circum&s;tance; but if &s;o, we have indeed got a very young &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or to the throne. My lord, an&s;wered the man, Schemerzad is allowed to be one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed and wi&s;e young princes in all Per&s;ia. That is marvellous, cried Nourjahad, bur&s;ting into a fit of laughter, a &s;ultan of four and twenty hours old mu&s;t needs be
<PB N="145" REF="147">
wonderou&s;ly wi&s;e and accompli&s;hed. Nay, my lord, replied the man, the prince is this day exactly twenty years of age.</P>
<P>(Nourjahad, on hearing this, looked in the face of the man, whom, from his dre&s;s, &s;uppo&s;ing he had been one of his &s;laves, he had not regarded before, but now perceived he was a &s;tranger.) Twenty years old! cried he, &s;tarting up, thou do&s;t not tell me &s;o! Mo&s;t certain, &s;aid the man. Schemzeddin was &s;o far advanced in years before the birth of the prince, that he de&s;paired of ever having a child; yet had the righ|teous monarch the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee his beloved &s;on arrive at manhood, and
<PB N="146" REF="148">
adorned with &s;uch virtues as made him worthy to fill his father's throne. When did the old &s;ultan die, cried Nourjahad? His funeral ob&s;equies were performed la&s;t night, an&s;wered the man, and the people of Ormuz have not yet wiped the tears from their eyes. It &s;hould &s;eem then, &s;aid Nourjahad, that I have &s;lept about twenty years! if &s;o, prithee, who art thou? for I do not remember ever to have &s;een thy face before.</P>
<P>My name, an&s;wered the &s;tranger, is Cozro, and I am the brother of Cadiga, that faithful creature whom thy ungo|verned fury deprived of life. How dare&s;t thou mention her again, cried Nourjahad, art thou not afraid to &s;hare
<PB N="147" REF="149">
the &s;ame fate thy&s;elf for thy pre&s;ump|tion?</P>
<P>I do not value my life, an&s;wered Cozro; having acquitted my&s;elf well of my duty here, I am &s;ure of my reward in tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed man&s;ions, where avarice, luxury, cruelty and pride, can never enter. Strike then, Nourjahad, if thou dare&s;t; di&s;mi&s;s me to endle&s;s and unin|terrupted joys, and live thy&s;elf a prey to remor&s;e and di&s;appointment, the &s;lave of pa&s;&s;ions never to be gratified, and a &s;port to the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune.</P>
<P>Nourjahad was confounded at the un|daunted air with which Cozro pro|nounced the&s;e words; he trembled
<PB N="148" REF="150">
with indignation, but had not courage to &s;trike the unarmed man who thus in|&s;ulted him; wherefore, di&s;&s;embling his anger, I &s;ee, &s;aid he, that thou partake&s;t of thy &s;i&s;ter Cadiga's &s;pirit; but an&s;wer me, How came&s;t thou hither, and in what condition are the re&s;t of my family? I will tell thee, an&s;wered Cozro. When Cadiga found her&s;elf dying, &s;he &s;ent for me: I was then a page to one of the emirs of Schemzeddin's court. She made me kneel by her bed-&s;ide and take a &s;olemn oath, to perform with fidelity and &s;ecrecy what &s;he &s;hould enjoin me. She then told me the &s;ecret of your life, and conjured me to watch and attend you carefully. I have hitherto, &s;aid &s;he, had the conduct of his hou&s;e; do you
<PB N="149" REF="151">
&s;upply my place, and do not let Nour|jahad, when he awakes from his trance, be &s;en&s;ible of the lo&s;s of the unfortunate Cadiga.</P>
<P>She then called in your principal &s;laves, and delivering to me in their pre&s;ence the keys with which you had entru&s;ted her, &s;he told them they were henceforth to obey me, as they had done her. Tell my lord, &s;aid &s;he to me, that I forgive him the death which his cruelty inflicted on a woman who loved him to the late&s;t minute of her life. In pronouncing the&s;e words, &s;he expired.</P>
<P>I knew not till then, pur&s;ued Cozro, that thou had&s;t been the murderer of
<PB N="150" REF="152">
my &s;i&s;ter; but &s;he was no &s;ooner dead, than the &s;laves informed me of the man|ner of her death. My re&s;entment again&s;t thee was proportioned to the horror of thy guilt; and had I thrown my&s;elf at the feet of Schemzeddin, and implored ju&s;tice on thy crimes, neither thy riches nor thy immortality would have availed thee, but thou would&s;t have been con|demned by a perpetual decree, to have langui&s;hed out thy wretched exi&s;tence in a vile dungeon.</P>
<P>And what hindered thee, cried Nour|jahad, from pur&s;uing thy revenge, &s;ee|ing I was not in a condition to re&s;i&s;t thee? My reverence for the oath I had
<PB N="151" REF="153">
taken, an&s;wered Cozro, and fear of of|fending the Almighty!</P>
<P>Nourjahad, at this reply, was &s;truck with a &s;ecret awe which he could not repel; he remained &s;ilent whil&s;t Cozro proceeded.</P>
<P>I obtained permi&s;&s;ion of the ma&s;ter whom I &s;erved, to leave him, and en|tered immediately on my new employ|ment; but I found I had undertaken a difficult ta&s;k. Thou had&s;t rendered thy|&s;elf &s;o odious to thy women, that not one of them retained the &s;malle&s;t degree of love or fidelity towards thee. In &s;pite of my vigilance they made thy hated &s;eraglio the &s;cene of their unlaw|ful
<PB N="152" REF="154">
plea&s;ures; and at length having bribed the cunuchs who guarded them, they all in one night fled from thy de|te&s;ted walls, taking with them the &s;laves who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in their purpo&s;e. Pernicious &s;pirit, exclaimed Nourjahad, are the&s;e the fruits I am to reap from thy fatal indulgence! The re&s;t of your &s;ervants, pur&s;ued Cozro, I endeavoured to keep within the bounds of their duty. And how did&s;t thou &s;ucceed, cried Nourjahad? But ill, replied Cozro; they all declared that nothing could have in|duced them to &s;tay &s;o long with a ma&s;|ter of &s;o capricious and tyrannical a hu|mour, but the luxury and idlene&s;s in which thou permitted&s;t them to live; and finding I managed your affairs with
<PB N="153" REF="155">
oeconomy, they one after the other left your hou&s;e; neither promi&s;es nor threats having power to prevent tho&s;e who &s;tayed longe&s;t in thy &s;ervice, from fol|lowing the example of the fir&s;t who de|&s;erted thee; &s;o that I alone of all thy numerous hou&s;ehold have remained faithful to thee: I, who of all others, had the mo&s;t rea&s;on to abhor thee! But I have now acquitted my&s;elf of the tru&s;t which was repo&s;ed in me, and I leave thee as one condemned to wander in an unknown land, where he is to &s;eek out for new a&s;&s;ociates, and to endeavour by the power of gold, to bribe that re|gard from men, which his own worth cannot procure for him.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="156">
Unfortunate wretch that I am, cried Nourjahad, pierced to the quick with what he had ju&s;t been told, what benefit have I hitherto received from my long life, but that of feeling by mi&s;erable experience, the ingratitude and frailty of man's nature. How tran&s;itory have been all my plea&s;ures! the recollection of them dies on my memory, like the departing colours of the rainbow, which fades under the eye of the beholder, and leaves not a trace behind. Whil&s;t on the other hand, every affliction with which I have been vi&s;ited, has imprinted a deep and la&s;ting wound on my heart, which not even the hand of time it&s;elf has been able to heal.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="157">
What have thy misfortunes been, &s;aid Cozro, that are not common to all the race of man? Oh, I have had innumer|able griefs, &s;aid Nourjahad. After a &s;hort enjoyment (during my fatal &s;lum|bers) the grave robbed me of Mandana, whil&s;t &s;he was yet in the bloom of youth and beauty. I lamented her death, tears and heavine&s;s of heart were my portion for many days. Yet remem|bering that &s;orrow would not recall the dead, I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be comforted, and &s;ought for con&s;olation in the &s;ociety of my other women, and the fond and innocent care&s;&s;es of an infant &s;on, whom Mandana left me. Joy and tranquillity revi&s;ited my dwelling, and new plea&s;ures courted my acceptance; but they again
<PB N="156" REF="158">
eluded my gra&s;p, and in one night (for &s;o it appeared to me) my &s;on like an un|natural viper, forgetting all my tender|ne&s;s, plundered and de&s;erted me. The two faithful friends in whom I mo&s;t con|fided, had clo&s;ed their eyes for ever; and the beauties of my &s;eraglio, whom I had la&s;t beheld fre&s;h and charming as the lillies of the field, I now &s;aw de|formed with wrinkles and bending un|der the infirmities of age.</P>
<P>Yet the&s;e afflictions I &s;urmounted, and re&s;olved once more to be happy. And wert thou &s;o, interrupted Cozro? No, replied Nourjahad, the treacherous joys deceived me; yet I &s;till looked forward with hope, but now awake
<PB N="157" REF="159">
to fre&s;h di&s;appointment. I find my&s;elf abandoned by tho&s;e who&s;e fal&s;e profe&s;|&s;ions of love had lulled me into &s;ecurity, and I rou&s;e my&s;elf like a &s;avage bea&s;t in the de&s;art, who&s;e paths are &s;hunned by all the children of men.</P>
<P>Nourjahad could not conclude this &s;peech without a groan, that &s;eemed to rend his heart.</P>
<P>As thou art, &s;aid Cozro, exempt from puni&s;hment hereafter, do&s;t thou think al&s;o to e&s;cape the mi&s;eries of this life? Mi&s;taken man, know, that the righteous Being, who&s;e ordinances thou defye&s;t, will even here take vengeance on thy crimes. And if thou wilt look back on
<PB N="158" REF="160">
thy pa&s;t life, thou wilt find (for I have heard thy &s;tory) that every one of tho&s;e &s;everal ills of which thou complaine&s;t, were &s;ent as &s;courges to remind thee of thy duty, and inflicted immediately after the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome notorious breach of it.</P>
<P>The death of Mandana was preceded by a brutal fit of drunkenne&s;s, by which, contrary to the laws of our prophet, thou &s;uffered&s;t thy&s;elf to be overtaken. Then it was thy good genius, to puni&s;h thee, plunged thee into that temporary death, from which thou did&s;t awake to grief and di&s;appointment: But thou made&s;t no u&s;e of the admonition, but did&s;t permit thy&s;elf to be again &s;wallowed
<PB N="159" REF="161">
up by intemperance; and not content to tread the ordinary paths of vice, thou turned&s;t out of the road, to the commi&s;|&s;ion of a crime, to which thou could&s;t have no temptation, but the pride and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of thy heart. Thy pro|fanation of our holy religion, in pre&s;um|ing to per&s;onate our great prophet, and make thy concubines repre&s;ent the vir|gins of paradi&s;e, was immediately cha&s;|ti&s;ed as it de&s;erved, by a &s;econd time depriving thee of tho&s;e faculties, which thou did&s;t pro&s;titute to &s;uch vile pur|po&s;es.</P>
<P>The ills with which thou founde&s;t thy&s;elf &s;urrounded on awaking from thy trance, &s;erved to no other purpo&s;e than
<PB N="160" REF="162">
to &s;tir up thy re&s;entment again&s;t the power who governed thy life. And in|&s;tead of reforming thy wickedne&s;s, thou &s;oughte&s;t out new ways of rendering thy|&s;elf &s;till more obnoxious to the wrath of Heaven. In the wantonne&s;s of thy cruelty, thou &s;tained&s;t thy hand in blood; and that &s;ame night, were thy eyelids &s;ealed up by the avenging hand of thy watchful genius, and thy depraved &s;en&s;es con&s;igned for twenty years to oblivion! See then, continued Cozro, if a life which is to be a continued round of crimes and puni&s;hments in alternate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is a gift worthy to be de&s;ired by a wi&s;e man? for a&s;&s;ure thy&s;elf, Oh Nourjahad, that by the immutable laws of heaven one is to be a con&s;tant conco|mitant

of the other, and that either in this world or the next, vice will meet its ju&s;t reward.</P>
<P>Alas, replied Nourjahad, thou ha&s;t awakened in me a remor&s;e of which I was never &s;en&s;ible before; I look back with &s;hame on the dete&s;ted u&s;e I have made of tho&s;e extraordinary gifts vouch|&s;afed me by my guardian &s;pirit.</P>
<P>What &s;hall I do, Oh Cozro, to expi|ate the offences I have committed? For though I have no dread of puni&s;hment hereafter, yet does that aetherial &s;park within, in&s;pire me with &s;uch horror for my former crimes, that all the vain de|lights which this world can afford me,
<PB N="162" REF="164">
will not re&s;tore my mind to peace, till by a &s;eries of good actions I have atoned for my pa&s;t offences.</P>
<P>If thou art &s;incere in thy re&s;olutions, replied Cozro, the means, thou knowe&s;t, are amply in thy power. Thy riches will enable thee to diffu&s;e ble&s;&s;ings among&s;t mankind, and thou wilt find more true luxury in that, than in all the gratifications wherewith thou ha&s;t in|dulged thy appetites.</P>
<P>It &s;hall be &s;o, replied Nourjahad; my trea&s;ures &s;hall be open to thee, thou ve|nerable old man, and do thou make it thy bu&s;ine&s;s to find out proper objects,
<PB N="163" REF="165">
whereon charity and benevolence may exert their utmo&s;t powers.</P>
<P>Enquire out every family in Ormuz whom calamity hath overtaken, and provided they did not bring on their di&s;|tre&s;&s;es by their own wilful mi&s;conduct, re&s;tore them to pro&s;perity. Seek out the helple&s;s and the innocent; and by a timely &s;upply of their wants, &s;ecure them again&s;t the attacks of poverty, or temptations of vice. Search for &s;uch as you think have talents which will ren|der them u&s;eful to &s;ociety; but who, for want of the goods of fortune, are con|demned to ob&s;curity; relieve their ne|ce&s;&s;ities, and enable them to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es for which nature de&s;igned

them. Find out merit wherever it lies concealed, whether with-held from the light by diffidence, chained down and clogged by adver&s;ity, ob&s;cured by ma|lice, or overborn by power; lift it up from the du&s;t, and let it &s;hine con&s;pi|cuous to the world.</P>
<P>Glorious ta&s;k! cried Cozro; happy am I in being the cho&s;en in&s;trument of Nourjahad's bounty, and &s;till more happy &s;hall he be in &s;eeing the accompli&s;hment of his good de&s;igns.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not &s;top here, &s;aid Nour|jahad; I will have ho&s;pitals built for the reception of the aged and the &s;ick; and my tables &s;hall be &s;pread for the refre&s;h|ment
<PB N="165" REF="167">
of the weary traveller. No vir|tuous action &s;hall pa&s;s by me unreward|ed, and no breach of the laws of tem|perance, ju&s;tice, or mercy, &s;hall e&s;cape unreproved. My own example, &s;o far as it can influence, &s;hall henceforth coun|tenance the one, and di&s;courage the other.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be the purpo&s;e of thy heart, &s;aid Cozro, and pro&s;perous be the days of thy life!</P>
<P>Nourjahad now found the anxiety un|der which he had but a little before la|boured, exceedingly relieved. My mind, &s;aid he, is much more at ea&s;e than it was; let us not delay to put our de|&s;ign
<PB N="166" REF="168">
in execution. I will lead you to the place where my trea&s;ure is con|cealed, which I never yet di&s;covered to any one. Saying this, he took Cozro by the hand, and conducted him to the cave.</P>
<P>Thou &s;ee&s;t here, &s;aid he, riches which can never be exhau&s;ted; thou maye&s;t perceive that I have not yet &s;unk a third part of one of the&s;e urns which contain my wealth; yet have I with mon&s;trous profu&s;ion lavi&s;hed away im|men&s;e &s;ums. Five more &s;uch urns as the&s;e are yet untouched. Tho&s;e &s;ix which thou &s;ee&s;t on the right hand, con|tain wedges of the fine&s;t gold, which mu&s;t be equal in value to the others.
<PB N="167" REF="169">
The&s;e &s;ix, which are ranged on the left, are filled with precious &s;tones, who&s;e worth mu&s;t be ine&s;timable: The wealth of Ormuz would not purcha&s;e a &s;ingle handful. Judge then, my friend, if I need be &s;paring in my liberality.</P>
<P>Cozro expre&s;&s;ed his a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;ight of the&s;e wonders. If thou would&s;t be advi&s;ed by me, &s;aid he, thou would&s;t &s;ecretly remove from Ormuz, and carry thy trea&s;ures with thee. Thou maye&s;t depo&s;it part of them in each of the different countries through which thou pa&s;&s;e&s;t in thy progre&s;s all over the earth. By this means thou maye&s;t have it in thy power to di&s;tribute with more ea&s;e thy bounty wherever thou goe&s;t;
<PB N="168" REF="170">
and be always provided with riches in what part &s;oever of the world thou &s;halt chu&s;e for a time to take up thy re&s;idence. Thy long abode in this city will draw ob&s;ervations on thee &s;ooner or later; and thy per&s;on's not having undergone any change from length of time, will bring on thee the &s;u&s;picion of magic; for tradition will not fail to in|form po&s;terity of thy &s;trange hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>You coun&s;el well, replied Nourjahad; as I am now at liberty, I will retire from Ormuz. You, my dear Cozro, &s;hall accompany me; your prudent coun&s;el &s;hall be my guide; and when I &s;hall be deprived of you by death, I will &s;till
<PB N="169" REF="171">
endeavour to follow your wi&s;e pre|cepts.</P>
<P>Come, continued he, I am in ha&s;te to enter on my new cour&s;e of life, let us both go into the city and try to find out proper objects on which to exert our charity. I &s;hall pa&s;s without ob&s;erva|tion, and unknown, as few of my co|temporaries can now be living, and I will not leave the country which gave me birth, without fir&s;t making it feel the effects of that beneficence which thou ha&s;t awakened in my heart.</P>
<P>De&s;erving of prai&s;e as thou art, &s;aid Cozro, thou for the pre&s;ent mu&s;t &s;up|pre&s;s thy ardor to do good; for though
<PB N="170" REF="172">
by the death of Schemzeddin thou art no longer a pri&s;oner, thou art not never|thele&s;s yet at liberty to leave thy hou&s;e. Why not? an&s;wered Nourjahad, who is there now to prevent me?</P>
<P>The young &s;ultan, replied Cozro, deeply afflicted for the death of his fa|ther, and out of a pious regard to his memory, has given &s;trict command|ment, that all his &s;ubjects &s;hould ob&s;erve a &s;olemn mourning for him, during the &s;pace of twenty days; in which time all the &s;hops, and places of public re&s;ort (except the mo&s;ques) are to be &s;hut up, and no bu&s;ine&s;s of any kind tran&s;acted; nor are any per&s;ons to be &s;een in the &s;treets, excepting tho&s;e who vi&s;it the
<PB N="171" REF="173">
&s;ick, and the &s;laves who mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be employed to carry provi&s;ions, on pain of the &s;ultan's heavy di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This edict was publi&s;hed ye&s;terday, and the people of Ormuz all love the memory of Schemzeddin, and the per&s;on of their pre&s;ent &s;ultan too well, not to pay an exact obedience to it.</P>
<P>If &s;o, &s;aid Nourjahad, I will not by my example encourage others to infringe their duty; yet as the relieving of the poor is in it&s;elf meritorious, I would not wi&s;h to be with-held from doing it &s;o long as twenty days: How many vir|tuous people may be during that time pining for want! more e&s;pecially as this
<PB N="172" REF="174">
prohibition mu&s;t cut off all intercour&s;e between man and man, and deprive many poor wretches of the charitable &s;uccour they might otherwi&s;e receive. I think therefore that thou, Cozro, in thy &s;lave's habit, may&s;t go forth un&s;u&s;pected; and by privately &s;eeking out, and alle|viating the mi&s;eries of our fellow citi|zens, do an act of more real benefit, than can re&s;ult from the &s;tricte&s;t conformity to this pageant of &s;orrow, which many in their hearts I am &s;ure mu&s;t con|demn.</P>
<P>Cozro approving of the&s;e &s;entiments, readily agreed to the expedient, and taking a large pur&s;e of gold with him to di&s;tribute as occa&s;ion might &s;erve, imme|diately
<PB N="173" REF="175">
diately &s;et out in order to execute his lord's commands.</P>
<P>Nourjahad now entered on a total re|formation in his way of living. He ro&s;e at day break, and &s;pent the morning in &s;tudy or meditation. Luxury and in|temperance were bani&s;hed from his board; his table was &s;pread with the plaine&s;t di&s;hes, and he wholly ab&s;tained from exce&s;s in wine. His &s;lumbers were &s;weet, and he found his health more vigorous.</P>
<P>I will no more, &s;aid he, en&s;lave my&s;elf to the power of beauty. I have lived to &s;ee the decay of a whole &s;eraglio of the faire&s;t faces in Per&s;ia, and have &s;ighed
<PB N="174" REF="176">
for the ingratitude of the next generation that &s;ucceeded them. I will not then &s;eek out for tho&s;e de&s;troyers of my quiet, for who&s;e death or infidelity I mu&s;t for ever complain. Mandana was the only woman who ever really de&s;erved my love; could I recal her from the grave, and endue her with the &s;ame privilege of which I am my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, I would confine my&s;elf to her arms alone; but &s;ince that is impo&s;&s;ible, I will devote my&s;elf to the charms of virtue, which of all things &s;he mo&s;t re&s;embled.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Nourjahad was thus re&s;olving to correct the errors of his pa&s;t life, his virtue was not merely in &s;peculation. He never laid him down to re&s;t, without
<PB N="175" REF="177">
the &s;atisfaction of having made &s;ome one the better for him. Cozro, who con|&s;tantly &s;pent the day in enquiring out and relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, failed not to return every night to give an account of his charitable mi&s;&s;ion, and to infu&s;e into his ma&s;ter's bo&s;om, the (till now unfelt) joy which &s;prings from righteous deeds.</P>
<P>The heart of Nourjahad was expand|ed, and glowed with compa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e &s;ufferings which Cozro feelingly de|&s;cribed as the lot of &s;o many of his fellow creatures. As charity and benevolence ro&s;e in his brea&s;t, he found his pride &s;ub&s;ide. He was con&s;cious of his own unworthine&s;s. He kneeled, he prayed,
<PB N="176" REF="178">
he humbled him&s;elf before the Almighty, and returned thanks to God for enabling him to &s;uccour the unfortunate.</P>
<P>In this happy frame of mind he con|tinued for eighteen days; there wanted but two more to the expiration of the mourning for the &s;ultan, when Nour|jahad was to be at full liberty to pur&s;ue in his own per&s;on the dictates of his re|formed, and now truly generous and benevolent heart.</P>
<P>He was &s;itting alone in his apartment, waiting the arrival of Cozro, in the plea&s;ing expectation of receiving &s;ome fre&s;h opportunity of doing good. The hour of his u&s;ual return was already
<PB N="177" REF="179">
pa&s;t, and Nourjahad began to fear &s;ome accident had happened to him; but he little knew that a black cloud hung over him, which was ready to pour down all its malignity on his own head.</P>
<P>As he mu&s;ed on what might be the occa&s;ion of Cozro's long &s;tay, he heard a loud knocking at his door. It was immediately opened by one of his &s;laves, and a man, who by his habit he knew to be one of the cady's officers, rudely entered his chamber.</P>
<P>How comes it, &s;aid the &s;tranger, that thou ha&s;t had the temerity, in contempt of our &s;overeign lord's commands, to
<PB N="178" REF="180">
employ thy emi&s;&s;ary about the city at a time when thou knowe&s;t that &s;o &s;trict an injunction has been laid on all people to keep within their hou&s;es, none being permitted to &s;tir abroad but for the ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ities of life, or in ca&s;es of imminent danger?</P>
<P>Far be it from me, replied Nourjahad, to di&s;obey our mighty &s;ultan's orders; but I under&s;tood that &s;laves had per|mi&s;&s;ion to go unque&s;tioned on their ma&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s. And what bu&s;ine&s;s, an&s;wered the man, can thy &s;lave have from morning to night in &s;o many differ|ent quarters of the city?</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="181">
Nourjahad, who did not care to be him&s;elf the trumpeter of his own good deeds, he&s;itated to give an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Ha, ha, cried the &s;tranger, I &s;ee plainly there is &s;omething dangerous in thy my&s;tery, and that the money which thy &s;lave has been di&s;tributing among&s;t &s;uch a variety of people, is for a pur|po&s;e very different from that which he pretends. A likely matter it is indeed that a private man &s;hould be&s;tow in charity &s;uch &s;ums as Cozro acknow|ledges he has within the&s;e few days di&s;|tributed!</P>
<P>Yet nothing is more certain, replied Nourjahad, than that Cozro has &s;poke
<PB N="180" REF="182">
the truth. We &s;hall &s;ee that, replied the officer, in a tone of in&s;olence; Cozro is already in pri&s;on, and my orders are to conduct thee to him.</P>
<P>Nourjahad, exceedingly troubled at hearing this, replied, He was ready to go with him; and the officer led him out of his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It was now late at night; they pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;treets without meeting any one, and &s;oon reached the place wherein Cozro was confined. It was the pri&s;on where &s;uch per&s;ons were &s;hut up as were accu&s;ed of trea&s;on again&s;t the &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="183">
Here he found the unfortunate Cozro in a dungeon. Alas, cried he, as &s;oon as his ma&s;ter entered, why do I &s;ee thee here? Say rather, my dear Cozro, replied Nourjahad, what &s;trange fata|lity has brought <HI>thee</HI> to this di&s;mal place?</P>
<P>I can give no other account, an&s;wered Cozro, but that in returning home this night, I was &s;eized on in the &s;treet by &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;oldiers who were em|ployed to patrol about the city, to &s;ee that the &s;ultan's orders were punctually ob&s;erved; and being que&s;tioned con|cerning my bu&s;ine&s;s, I told them that I had been relieving the wants of indigent people, and &s;aving even from peri&s;hing,
<PB N="182" REF="184">
&s;ome poor wretches who had not where|withal to buy food.</P>
<P>That is an idle errand, replied one of them, and might have been deferred till the term of mourning was expired; however, if you will give me a piece of gold, I will let you pa&s;s for this time, otherwi&s;e both you and your employer may happen to repent of having tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed the &s;ultan's commands. I made no &s;cruple, pur&s;ued Cozro, to take out my pur&s;e, in which there were ten &s;e|quins left. I gave one of them to the &s;oldier, but the rapacious wretches &s;ee|ing I had more money, were not con|tent with this, but in&s;i&s;ted on my giving the whole among&s;t them. I refu&s;ed;
<PB N="183" REF="185">
&s;ome angry words en&s;ued; one of the mi&s;creants &s;truck me, and I returned the blow. Enraged at this, they hurried me before the cady, to whom they ac|cu&s;ed me of having di&s;obeyed the edict, and a&s;&s;aulted the &s;ultan's officers in the di&s;charge of their duty. I was not heard in my defence, having four witne&s;&s;es again&s;t me, but was immediately dragged to this horrid pri&s;on; and the &s;ultan him&s;elf, they &s;ay, is to take cognizance of my offence.</P>
<P>Oh, Heaven, cried Nourjahad, to what mi&s;chiefs does not the love of gold ex|po&s;e us! See, my friend, into what mi&s;|fortunes thou art plunged by the &s;ordid avarice of tho&s;e vile &s;oldiers. But why,
<PB N="184" REF="186">
why did&s;t thou he&s;itate to give up that paltry &s;um which thou had&s;t in thy pur&s;e, to obtain thy liberty? I do not repent what I have done, an&s;wered Cozro, and &s;hall contentedly &s;uffer the penalty I have incurred, &s;ince it was in &s;o good a cau&s;e.</P>
<P>If the &s;ultan is ju&s;t, replied Nour|jahad, the puni&s;hment ought only to fall on me, who alone am guilty, &s;ince what thou did&s;t was by my command.</P>
<P>Here the officer who had conducted Nourjahad to pri&s;on, and who was pre|&s;ent at this di&s;cour&s;e, interpo&s;ed, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Nourjahad, Thou ha&s;t not as yet been accu&s;ed to the &s;ultan,
<PB N="185" REF="187">
&s;aid he, and it is not too late to extricate even thy &s;lave from this trouble&s;ome affair; it is but making a hand&s;ome pre|&s;ent to the cady, and I will undertake this matter will go no farther. I am willing to do &s;o, replied Nourjahad, eagerly; name your demand, and you &s;hall have it. Provided I am allowed to go home to my own hou&s;e, I will fetch the money; and if you are afraid of my e&s;caping, you your&s;elf may bear me company.</P>
<P>I will not con&s;ent to it, replied Cozro; neither liberty nor life are worth pur|cha&s;ing on ba&s;e conditions. I will &s;ub|mit my cau&s;e to Schemerzad's ju&s;tice; the cau&s;e of uprightne&s;s and truth; my
<PB N="186" REF="188">
own innocence &s;hall be my &s;upport, and I will dare the wor&s;t that fraud and ma|lice can &s;ugge&s;t again&s;t me.</P>
<P>In vain did Nourjahad urge him to accept the profered terms; he remained inflexible to all the arguments he could u&s;e to per&s;uade him; wherefore, finding him determined, he was obliged to de|&s;i&s;t; and Cozro, after pa&s;&s;ing the re|mainder of the night in quiet and pro|found &s;leep, though without any other bed than the bare earth, was at dawn of day called forth to appear before the &s;ultan.</P>
<P>The reflections Nourjahad made on the re&s;olute behaviour of Cozro, &s;erved
<PB N="187" REF="189">
not a little to fortify his mind. How noble mu&s;t this man's &s;oul be, &s;aid he, which &s;ets him thus above the reach of adver&s;ity? and with what contempt he looks down on the glorious pro&s;pects he has before him, when put in the balance with his integrity. Surely it is not in this life he places his happine&s;s, &s;ince he is &s;o ready to forego the plea|&s;ures he might enjoy with me, in that participation of wealth and liberty which I have promi&s;ed him. How &s;uperior is my &s;ervant to me, who but for his example, &s;hould now &s;ink under my fears; but he has re&s;ources which I have not. Alas, why did I barter my hopes of paradi&s;e for the vain, the tran&s;itory,
<PB N="188" REF="190">
the fallacious joys which this vile world be&s;tows! Already I have tried them; what do they in&s;pire but &s;atiety and di&s;|gu&s;t. I never experienced true content|ment, but during the time, &s;hort as it is, &s;ince I abjured tho&s;e follies in which I once delighted: And I am now per|&s;uaded, that after having pa&s;t a few, a very few years more in the enjoyment of &s;uch gratifications as I have not yet had an opportunity of ta&s;ting, that I &s;hall grow even weary of the light, and wi&s;h to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to that place, where we are told no &s;orrows can approach.</P>
<P>Nourjahad was buried in the&s;e re|flections, when he was rou&s;ed by the
<PB N="189" REF="191">
return of Cozro. The glimmering light which a lamp afforded, &s;truck full on the face of his friend (for he no longer con&s;idered him as a &s;ervant) and he re|joiced to &s;ee Cozro's chearful counte|nance, by which he judged that he had nothing to fear.</P>
<P>I am come, &s;aid Cozro, approaching Nourjahad, and ki&s;&s;ing his hand, to bid thee adieu, for from this day, we are to be for ever divided! It is that thought only which makes our &s;eparation griev|ous: Had I hopes of ever beholding thy face in the man&s;ions of light, I &s;hould go to death with the &s;ame alacrity with which I clo&s;e my eyes in &s;lumber.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192">
Good Heaven, cried Nourjahad, doe&s;t thou talk of death? Can it be, is it po&s;|&s;ible that thy life is in danger?</P>
<P>What is the life, about which thou art anxious? replied Cozro; our being here is but a &s;hadow; that only is real exi&s;tence which the ble&s;&s;ed enjoy after their &s;hort travel here. And know, Oh Nourjahad, I would not yield up my expectations of the humble&s;t place in paradi&s;e for the &s;overeign rule of the whole earth, though my days were to be extended to the date of thy life, and every wi&s;h of my &s;oul gratified to the utmo&s;t. Think then, with how little reluctance I &s;hall leave a world, wherein
<PB N="191" REF="193">
I am &s;ure of meeting nothing but op|pre&s;&s;ion, treachery, and di&s;appointment, where mercy is con&s;trued into trea&s;on, and charity is called &s;edition!</P>
<P>And art thou then doomed to die? &s;aid Nourjahad, pale and trembling at the thought, though convinced it was a predicament in which he could never &s;tand.</P>
<P>I am, an&s;wered Cozro, my offence was found capital. Di&s;obedience to the &s;ultan's edict alone, incurred a heavy puni&s;hment; but my crime was, by the malice of my accu&s;ers, &s;o highly aggra|vated, that the penalty became death.
<PB N="192" REF="194">
They charged me with having di&s;tri|buted money for evil purpo&s;es, among&s;t per&s;ons di&s;affected to the &s;tate, and with having beat and abu&s;ed tho&s;e officers who fir&s;t detected me. In vain did I offer all the pleas that truth could &s;ug|ge&s;t; my enemies, exa&s;perated at lo&s;ing the &s;um which they hoped to have ex|torted from you, &s;wore to the facts of which I was accu&s;ed, and the rigid &s;ul|tan condemned me to death. What thy fate is to be, I know not; but &s;ince it is thy misfortune to be doomed to perpe|tual life, better purcha&s;e thy freedom on any terms, than be condemned to langui&s;h for years in a pri&s;on, for &s;uch probably will be thy lot.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="195">
Oh that I could die with thee! &s;aid Nourjahad, mi&s;erable that I am, thus to be deprived of thy coun&s;el and friend|&s;hip, at a time when I &s;o much &s;tood in need of them; but wherefore, my friend, why &s;hould we &s;ubmit to the tyranny of the &s;ultan? though thou art condemned, there may yet be found means to deliver thee. The keeper of the pri&s;on will gladly &s;et a price on thy liberty; a hun|dred thou&s;and pieces of gold &s;hall be thy ran&s;om; and I &s;hall think my&s;elf rich by the purcha&s;e! And what is to become of thee, replied Cozro? I will buy my own freedom at the &s;ame rate, an&s;wered Nourjahad, and we will both fly from Ormuz together. And leave
<PB N="194" REF="196">
your trea&s;ures behind you, cried Cozro, for it will be impo&s;&s;ible to convey from hence &s;uch a va&s;t ma&s;s of riches without di&s;covery.</P>
<P>I value them no longer, &s;aid Nour|jahad; they can never yield me any per|manent enjoyment. The &s;aving thy life is the only good turn I now expect from them. That once accompli&s;hed, I &s;hall de&s;ire to retain no more of them than what will &s;upport me above want, and I will leave the re&s;t to be for ever hid in the bo&s;om of the earth, where they now lie, that they may never more become a &s;nare to others as they have been to me.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="197">
Prai&s;ed be our holy prophet, &s;aid Cozro, that has at length endued the heart of Nourjahad with wi&s;dom. Pur|&s;ue the purpo&s;es of thy &s;oul; effect thy own freedom as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, &s;ince no comfort can vi&s;it thee in the gloom of this frightful pri&s;on; but tempt not Cozro back to a life which he de&s;pi&s;es. I tell thee again, there is nothing in this world to be put in competition with the glories I have in pro&s;pect in that &s;tate to which I am now ha&s;tening. Why then, Nourjahad, would&s;t thou retard my fe|licity, or wi&s;h me to hazard, for the &s;ake of delu&s;ive plea&s;ures, tho&s;e tran|&s;cendent joys which await the vir|tuous.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="198">
The energy with which Cozro deli|vered him&s;elf, pierced Nourjahad to the inmo&s;t &s;oul. A holy ardor was kindled in his brea&s;t, which he had never felt before; he found his faculties enlarged, his mind was tran&s;ported above this world; he felt as it were unimbodied, and an involuntary adjuration bur&s;t from his lips. <Q REND="inline">Oh, holy prophet, &s;aid he, take, take back the gift, that I in the ignorance and pre&s;umption of my heart &s;o vainly &s;ought, and which too late I find a puni&s;hment in&s;tead of a ble&s;&s;ing! I contemn riches, and for ever ca&s;t them from me; &s;uffer me then to yield up my life; for there can be no true hap|pine&s;s but in beholding thee, Oh Ma|homet,
<PB N="197" REF="199">
face to face, in the never|fading fields of paradi&s;e!</Q></P>
<P>Saying this, he pro&s;trated him&s;elf on the ground, and continued for &s;ome time in mental prayer.</P>
<P>Cozro ob&s;erved an awful &s;ilence whil&s;t he continued in this po&s;ture. When Nourjahad aro&s;e from the earth, May our great prophet, &s;aid Cozro, hear your prayers; and were he even now to grant them, all the favours he has al|ready be&s;towed on you would be poor and contemptible to this la&s;t be&s;t boon. Farewel, &s;aid he, I mu&s;t now leave thee, I was only permitted to come and bid thee adieu. May the Supreme grant
<PB N="198" REF="200">
thy petition, then &s;hall we again meet in the man&s;ions of happy &s;pirits. Nour|jahad embraced him, and Cozro with|drew.</P>
<P>Being now left at liberty to his own thoughts, he made bitter reflections on the &s;trangene&s;s of his fate. Fool, fool that I was, cried he aloud, beating his brea&s;t, to prefer &s;o ra&s;h, &s;o impious a petition to the prophet, as to de&s;ire the everla&s;ting laws of nature to be over|turned, to gratify my mad luxurious wi&s;hes. I thought the life of man too &s;hort for the enjoyment of tho&s;e various and unbounded plea&s;ures which wealth could procure; but it is long &s;ince I have found my error. Well did my guardian
<PB N="199" REF="201">
&s;pirit &s;ay I &s;hould repent of the gift I had implored, when it &s;hould be too late. I do indeed repent; but Oh, thou benign intelligence, if thou ha&s;t remain|ing any favour for thy incon&s;iderate un|happy charge, de&s;cend once more to my relief, and if po&s;&s;ible re&s;tore me to that &s;tate, for which I was de&s;igned by my creator; a poor mortal, liable to, and now longing for the friendly &s;troke of death.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce pronounced the&s;e words, when his pri&s;on doors flew open; a refulgent light fla&s;hed in, which illu|minated the whole dungeon, and he be|held his guardian genius &s;tanding be|fore him, exactly as he had appeared to
<PB N="200" REF="202">
him before. Thy prayers are heard, &s;aid he, Oh &s;on of frailty, and thy peni|tence is accepted in the &s;ight of the Mo&s;t High. I am &s;ent down again by our prophet to rea&s;&s;ume that gift which thou art now &s;atisfied mu&s;t make thee mi&s;erable. Yet examine thy heart once more before I pronounce thy irrevocable doom; &s;ay, art thou willing again to be|come &s;ubject to the common lot of mor|tals?</P>
<P>Mo&s;t willing, replied Nourjahad; yet I wonder not, my &s;eraphic guide, that thou &s;hould&s;t doubt the &s;tability of my mind; but in this la&s;t purpo&s;e of it I am &s;ure I &s;hall remain un&s;haken.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="203">
If &s;o, replied the &s;hining vi&s;ion, thy guardian angel con&s;igns thee to the arms of death, with much more joy than he conferred on thee riches and immortality. Thou ha&s;t nothing more to do, than to pro&s;trate thy&s;elf with thy face to the earth. Remain this evening in fervent prayer, and await what &s;hall befal thee to-morrow.</P>
<P>Nourjahad made no reply, but falling with his face to the ground, he &s;oon found the dungeon re&s;tored to its former gloom, the light and the guardian &s;pi|rit vani&s;hing together in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="204">
He continued in devout prayer till night; when the keeper of the pri&s;on entered his dungeon to bring him &s;ome refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>The &s;ultan, &s;aid he, purpo&s;es to examine you to-morrow, and much I fear you will have as rigorous a &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed on you, as that which has been already executed on Cozro. Is he then dead, cried Nourjahad, mournfully? He is, replied the keeper; it is but an hour &s;ince I &s;aw him deprived of breath; but he received the blow with &s;uch an heroic firmne&s;s, that thou would&s;t have thought he rather enjoyed a triumph, than &s;uffered an ignominious death.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="205">
Happy, happy Cozro! cried Nour|jahad; thou art now beyond the reach of misfortune, whil&s;t I, perhaps, may be doomed to &s;u&s;tain for years a wretched life.</P>
<P>Thy life, &s;aid the keeper, may be nearer a period than thou art aware of. The &s;ultan is covetous, and &s;urrounded by needy favourites, whom the report of your immen&s;e wealth has made eager for your de&s;truction; for you cannot be ignorant, that &s;hould you die, involved as it is &s;aid you are, in Cozro's guilt, your trea&s;ures would be confi&s;cated to the &s;ultan. From this circum&s;tance I have heard it whi&s;pered, your head is already devoted; and this perhaps was
<PB N="204" REF="206">
the true cau&s;e of Cozro's death, and will give the better colour to your's. It is not, however, added he, even yet too late to prevent the danger; had not your &s;lave been ob&s;tinate, he might now have been alive, and out of the reach of harm. You have the &s;ame means of pre&s;erva|tion in regard to your own per&s;on, &s;till in your power; and if you will make it worth my while to run the ri&s;que, I will this night &s;et you at liberty.</P>
<P>And do&s;t thou think, &s;aid Nourjahad, that I have profited &s;o little by the ex|ample of my noble friend, as to accept of thy offer, fordid and treacherous as thou art? If thou art ba&s;e enough to betray thy tru&s;t for gold, know that the
<PB N="205" REF="207">
mind of Nourjahad is above receiving a favour from &s;uch a wretch. As for my wealth, let the &s;ultan take it; my only wi&s;h is to part with that and my life al&s;o.</P>
<P>That wi&s;h may &s;peedily be accom|pli&s;hed, &s;aid the keeper, in an angry tone, and to-morrow perhaps you may repent of your folly, when you find your&s;elf condemned to follow your noble friend to the other world. Nour|jahad made no reply; and the keeper &s;ullenly departed.</P>
<P>Nourjahad &s;pent the night in prayers and meditation; he found peace and tranquillity re&s;tored to his brea&s;t, and
<PB N="206" REF="208">
perfectly re&s;igned to the will of the pro|phet, he waited the event of the next day with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>In the morning the keeper of the pri|&s;on entered to him. Follow me, &s;aid he; thou art going to appear before the &s;ultan, who him&s;elf is to be thy judge; a rigorous one thou wilt find him, but thy folly be on thy own head, who did&s;t proudly refu&s;e the profer I made thee of liberty and life.</P>
<P>Lead on, &s;aid Nourjahad, it is not for &s;uch men as thou art, to cen&s;ure a con|duct, to which thou do&s;t not know the motive.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="209">
He was now carried out of the dun|geon, and ordered to a&s;cend a chariot, in which the captain of the &s;ultan's guards was already placed, to receive his pri&s;oner. The chariot was &s;urround|ed by &s;oldiers; and in this manner he was conducted to the pre&s;ence of the &s;ultan.</P>
<P>Schemerzad was &s;eated on a throne, in the hall of his palace, wherein he was u&s;ed to di&s;tribute ju&s;tice. The emirs, and great officers of his court, were &s;tanding round him.</P>
<P>Nourjahad &s;tood before him with his eyes bent to the ground; and however awed he might be at the pre&s;ence of his
<PB N="208" REF="210">
royal ma&s;ter, and the augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly which &s;urrounded him, yet the dignity of con&s;cious innocence, and the perfect reliance he had on the Supreme Judge of <HI>his</HI> judge, rendered him &s;uperior to every thing. His deportment was mo|de&s;t and re&s;pectful, yet did he di&s;cover no &s;ymptom of fear.</P>
<P>The &s;ultan made a &s;ign for every one pre&s;ent to withdraw, but one per&s;on who &s;tood on the lower &s;tep of his throne, and whom Nourjahad judged to be his prime vi&s;ier.</P>
<P>What ha&s;t thou to &s;ay, pre&s;umptuous man, &s;aid Schemerzad, in a &s;tern voice, what excu&s;e can&s;t thou offer for daring,
<PB N="209" REF="211">
in contempt of my edict, to employ thy agent (during the time &s;et apart for mourning) in going about the city from day to day; o&s;tentatiou&s;ly di&s;playing thy ill-timed liberality among&s;t my &s;ub|jects; endeavouring, as I am informed, to conciliate their affections, for pur|po&s;es dangerous to me, and the &s;afety of my crown. What ha&s;t thou to offer in an&s;wer to this charge?</P>
<P>Nourjahad pro&s;trated him&s;elf to the ground. Mighty &s;ultan, &s;aid he, I have nothing to offer in extenuation of my fault, with regard to the fir&s;t part of the charge. I acknowlege that I di&s;tributed money among&s;t your maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and that at a time too when every act (but
<PB N="210" REF="212">
tho&s;e of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity) was inter|dicted. I offer not to palliate this breach of my duty.&mdash;</P>
<P>Audacious wretch, interrupted the &s;ultan, to what end was thy profu&s;ion employed?</P>
<P>To obtain a ble&s;&s;ing from heaven, an&s;wered Nourjahad; and by relieving the wants and afflictions of others, to make &s;ome atonement for my own riotous and intemperate abu&s;e of that wealth, which ought to have been em|ployed to better purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Would&s;t thou per&s;uade me then, cried Schemerzad, that charity was thy mo|tive!
<PB N="211" REF="213">
It was, illu&s;trious &s;ultan, replied Nourjahad; I have &s;poke the truth, and to convince your maje&s;ty that I have no &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns again&s;t the ever &s;acred per&s;on of my &s;overeign, I will now vo|luntarily yield up that trea&s;ure to thee, which had I been vile enough to have &s;o employed, would have bought the fidelity of more than half thy &s;ubjects, though every man of them had &s;tood near the heart, and throne of Schemer|zad.</P>
<P>The undaunted manner in which Nourjahad &s;poke the&s;e words, made Schemerzad &s;hake on his imperial &s;eat; but quickly rea&s;&s;uming the maje&s;ty of
<PB N="212" REF="214">
his &s;tation, Do then as thou ha&s;t &s;poken, &s;aid he, and I will believe thee.</P>
<P>If your maje&s;ty will permit me, &s;aid Nourjahad, to go to my hou&s;e, and will &s;end a proper per&s;on with me, I will de|liver up into his hands all my wealth, reque&s;ting no more than will &s;upply my wants &s;o long as heaven permits me to live.</P>
<P>I will not tru&s;t thee out of my &s;ight, &s;aid Schemerzad; thou maye&s;t as well in&s;truct &s;ome one in my pre&s;ence where to find the riches of which I hear thou art po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and I will &s;end for them.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="215">
Nourjahad then informed the &s;ultan of the &s;ubterraneous cave in his garden; and delivering him the key, told him he would there find all the wealth of which he was ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Schemerzad immediately di&s;patched his vi&s;ier, ordering him to have the riches he &s;hould find, immediately con|veyed to his trea&s;ury. He then com|manded Nourjahad to retire into a &s;a|loon, that was &s;eparated from the hall only by a curtain, and there wait the return of the vi&s;ier; before whom, the &s;ultan &s;aid he had &s;ome farther que&s;tions to put to him.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="216">
As the gardens of Nourjahad joined to tho&s;e belonging to the royal palace, the vi&s;ier was not long in going and re|turning. Nourjahad heard him talk to Schemerzad, and &s;traight he was called on to come forth, and &s;tand before the &s;ultan: But Schemerzad now acco&s;ted him in a voice like thunder. Perfidious and in&s;olent &s;lave, &s;aid he, art thou not afraid of in&s;tant death falling on thee, for daring thus to fal&s;ify before thy &s;o|vereign lord and ma&s;ter? Say, before thou art cut off by torture from the face of the earth, where thou ha&s;t concealed thy wealth! for well thou knowe&s;t, there is nothing contained in that cave, which
<PB N="215" REF="217">
thou pretende&s;t with &s;o much care to lock up.</P>
<P>Nothing! replied Nourjahad, in amazement. By the head of our pro|phet, when I la&s;t was there, it contained more than would purcha&s;e thy whole empire a thou&s;and times over. It was but the very day on which I was dragged to pri&s;on, that I &s;aw it; the key has never &s;ince been out of my pocket; who then could po&s;&s;ibly have conveyed away my trea&s;ure?</P>
<P>As Nourjahad applied him&s;elf to the vi&s;ier whil&s;t he &s;poke, that mini&s;ter thinking him&s;elf reflected on by his words, replied &s;cornfully, Thou thinke&s;t
<PB N="216" REF="218">
perhaps it is I who have robbed thee, and that I have framed this &s;tory to de|ceive the &s;ultan, and ruin thee. I do not &s;ay &s;o, an&s;wered Nourjahad; but this I am &s;ure of, that no human being but thy&s;elf knew where to find my trea|&s;ure. Some daemon, perhaps, replied the vi&s;ier, with an air of contempt, has removed it thence.</P>
<P>Nourjahad now recollecting &s;uddenly, that his guardian &s;pirit had probably re|claimed this, as well as the other gift, replied coolly, It is not at all unlikely; a certain genius, who watches over my motions, has undoubtedly carried away my wealth.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="219">
Do not think, &s;aid the &s;ultan, that affecting to be out of thy &s;en&s;es, &s;hall pre&s;erve thee from my wrath.</P>
<P>Your maje&s;ty, &s;aid the vi&s;ier, had be&s;t order that his head be in&s;tantly &s;truck off, for daring to impo&s;e on your credu|lity, and abu&s;e your clemency in &s;uffer|ing him to out-live that &s;lave, who ob|&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to di&s;cover his ma&s;ter's riches.</P>
<P>Did Cozro do &s;o? cried Nourjahad: He did, an&s;wered the vi&s;ier; but we will &s;ee whether thou wilt per&s;evere in the denial, and to the late&s;t minute of thy life pre&s;erve the firmne&s;s of thy &s;lave.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="220">
And who is it that thou calle&s;t a &s;lave, thou mini&s;ter of cruelty? &s;aid Nourjahad boldly: The &s;oul of Cozro rai&s;ed him infinitely more above thee, than the rank of the &s;ultan of Per&s;ia lifts him above the meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects.&mdash;My lord, pur&s;ued he, throwing him&s;elf at Schemerzad's feet, I have no other plea to offer for my life; I call Heaven to witne&s;s I have &s;poken nothing but the truth; the &s;evere&s;t tortures you can in|flict on me will extort no more. I was willing to make a voluntary &s;acrifice of my riches: I am now as ready to yield my life.</P>
<P>Art thou not then afraid to die? &s;aid Schemerzad.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="221">
No, mighty &s;ultan, an&s;wered Nour|jahad, I look upon death to a virtuous man, as the greate&s;t good the Almighty can be&s;tow!</P>
<P>The &s;ultan, in&s;tead of making any reply, clapped his hands; and Nour|jahad &s;uppo&s;ing it was a &s;ignal to have him &s;eized and carried to execution, ro&s;e up, and &s;tood with an intrepidity in his looks, that &s;hewed how little he was af|fected with the near pro&s;pect of death.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of the &s;laves whom he ex|pected to &s;ee coming to lay hold on him, he beheld &s;tanding clo&s;e to the throne of Schemerzad, his guardian genius, ju&s;t in
<PB N="220" REF="222">
the &s;ame cele&s;tial form in which he had twice before appeared to him!</P>
<P>Awed and amazed, Nourjahad &s;tarted back, and gazed at the heavenly vi&s;ion. Not daring to tru&s;t his &s;en&s;es, he re|mained mute, and motionle&s;s, for &s;ome minutes; but he was rou&s;ed from his deep attention, by a loud bur&s;t of laugh|ter, which broke at once from the &s;ul|tan, the vi&s;ier, and the guardian genius.</P>
<P>This new and extraordinary incident threw Nourjahad into fre&s;h a&s;toni&s;h|ment; when, without giving him time to recover him&s;elf, the angelic youth, &s;natching from his head a circlet of
<PB N="221" REF="223">
flowers intermixed with precious &s;tones, which encompa&s;&s;ed his brows, and &s;haded a great part of his forehead; and at the &s;ame time throwing off a head of arti|ficial hair which flowed in golden ring|lets down his &s;houlders; a fine fall of brown hair which was concealed under it &s;ucceeded, dropping in light curls on his neck and blu&s;hing cheeks; and Nourjahad, in the per&s;on of his &s;eraphic guide, di&s;covered his beloved and beau|tiful Mandana!</P>
<P>Whatever tran&s;ports the &s;ight of her would at another time have in&s;pired in the brea&s;t of Nourjahad, his faculties were now too much ab&s;orbed in wonder, to leave room for any other pa&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="222" REF="224">
Wherefore, not daring to approach her, the &s;ultan, willing to put an end to his &s;u&s;pence, cried out, Look up, Nour|jahad, rai&s;e thy eyes to thy ma&s;ter's face, no longer the angry Schemerzad, thy offended prince, but the real Schem|zeddin, thy friend and kind protector.</P>
<P>Nourjahad, who before, out of re|&s;pect and awful di&s;tance, had not ven|tured to look in the &s;ultan's face, now fixed his eyes earne&s;tly upon him. By the life of Schemerzad, &s;aid he, if I were not certain that all this is illu&s;ion, and that thy illu&s;trious father, my royal and once beloved ma&s;ter, is dead, thou art &s;o very like him, that I &s;hould &s;wear that thou wert the real &s;ultan Schem|zeddin
<PB N="223" REF="225">
him&s;elf; &s;uch at thy years was his countenance and features.</P>
<P>The &s;ultan at this bur&s;t into a &s;econd fit of laughter. And for whom, &s;aid the vi&s;ier, (who had by this time taken off his turban, and a fal&s;e beard which he wore) for whom would&s;t thou take me?</P>
<P>By Mahomet, cried Nourjahad, fall|ing back a &s;tep or two, I &s;hould take thee for my old friend Ha&s;em, if I were not convinced that the good man died above twenty years ago.</P>
<P>It is time, &s;aid the &s;ultan, de&s;cending from his throne, and taking Nourjahad
<PB N="224" REF="226">
by the hand, it is now time to undeceive thee, and explain to thee the my&s;tery of all tho&s;e extraordinary events, which &s;eem to have bewildered thy &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>Know then, Nourjahad, that the ad|venture of thy guardian genius was all a deception, and a piece of machinery of my contrivance. You are now con|vinced, by the evidence of your own eyes, that your cele&s;tial intelligence was no other than this young dam&s;el.</P>
<P>I had a mind to make trial of thy heart, and for this purpo&s;e made choice of this charming virgin, for whom I own I had entertained a pa&s;&s;ion, but found I could not gain her affections. She had
<PB N="225" REF="227">
&s;een you from the windows of the wo|mens apartments, walking with me in the gardens of the &s;eraglio, and had conceived a tenderne&s;s for you, which &s;he frankly confe&s;&s;ed to me, declaring at the &s;ame time, &s;he would never give her love to any other. Though &s;he was my &s;lave, I would not put a con&s;traint upon her inclinations; but told her, if &s;he would a&s;&s;i&s;t me faithfully in a de&s;ign I had formed, I would reward her, by be&s;towing her on you.</P>
<P>She readily a&s;&s;ented to my propo&s;al, and having previou&s;ly prepared every thing for my purpo&s;e, I equipped her as you &s;ee.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="228">
It was not difficult for me to introduce her into your chamber, by a private door which you know communicates between your apartments, and certain lodgings in my palace.</P>
<P>I my&s;elf &s;tood at the door, whil&s;t &s;he entered as you &s;lept, and contrived to throw that light into your chamber, which di&s;clo&s;ed to you the wonderful vi&s;ion. I overheard all your di&s;cour&s;e, and could &s;carce contain my laughter, when you &s;o greedily received that mar|vellous e&s;&s;ence from Mandana; which you &s;uppo&s;ed would confer immortality; but which was in reality nothing more than a &s;oporific drug, of &s;o potent a
<PB N="227" REF="229">
nature, that the fumes of it alone, were capable of throwing the per&s;on who &s;melt to them into a profound &s;leep. It had quickly this effect on you; and I took that opportunity of conveying into your chamber tho&s;e coffers which you thought contained &s;uch immen&s;e trea|&s;ures; but which in truth were as great counterfeits as your guardian angel. The &s;uppo&s;ed precious &s;tones, were no|thing more than fal&s;e gems, which I procured from a &s;kilful lapidary, who had given them &s;uch an extraordinary poli&s;h and lu&s;tre, that they might well pa&s;s for jewels of ine&s;timable value, on one better &s;killed in tho&s;e matters than you were.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="230">
The ingots of gold were all ba&s;e metal, which I got from the &s;ame arti&s;t. Nothing, in &s;hort, was real, but the money, part of which I was very willing to &s;acrifice to my experiment; though, as I have managed it, the large&s;t &s;ums which thou in thy extravagance ha&s;t expended, were returned into my coffers.</P>
<P>As I naturally &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;o long as the money la&s;ted you would not have recour&s;e to the other trea&s;ures, I was not afraid of having the fraud detected. The cave, which was an accidental cir|cum&s;tance, but of which I had long known, was by my contrivance made the repo&s;itory of thy riches.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="231">
When thou wert &s;ettled in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of thy imaginary felicity, thou may&s;t remember that Ha&s;em was fir&s;t recommended to thy &s;ervice; Mandana too was among&s;t other &s;laves pre&s;ented to thy view. No wonder that her charms captivated thy heart. Her love to thee was as pure as it was fervent; but thy boundle&s;s wi&s;hes were not to be re|&s;trained; and forgetting all the rational principles that thou did&s;t at fir&s;t lay down to regulate thy conduct, thou gave&s;t thy&s;elf up to all manner of vile exce&s;&s;es, and did&s;t &s;hew the depravity of the human heart, when unre&s;trained by divine laws.</P>
<P>It was now time, I thought, to puni&s;h thee, and to &s;hew thee the vanity of all
<PB N="230" REF="232">
earthly enjoyments. By opiates infu&s;ed into thy wine that night on which thou did&s;t deba&s;e thy&s;elf by drunkenne&s;s, I threw thee into a &s;ound &s;leep; and though it la&s;ted not much longer than the u&s;ual term of ordinary repo&s;e, it yet gave me an opportunity of making &s;uch farther di&s;po&s;itions, as I thought nece&s;|&s;ary for the carrying on of my de&s;ign.</P>
<P>I laid hold of this juncture to with|draw Mandana from thy arms, promi&s;ing however to re&s;tore her to thee, if I found thee ever worthy of her.</P>
<P>I believe it is needle&s;s to inform you, that the confinement I laid you under was for no other end than to cut off all
<PB N="231" REF="233">
intercour&s;e between you and any others than tho&s;e of your own hou&s;ehold, every one of whom were of my placing about you, even to the ladies of your &s;eraglio, who were no others than the prettie&s;t &s;laves I could find, among&s;t tho&s;e who attended on my own women.</P>
<P>Every one entru&s;ted with my &s;ecret, were tied down by the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths to keep it inviolably; and this with a promi&s;e of reward, &s;erved, as the event has &s;hewn, to &s;ecure their fidelity.</P>
<P>There was not an action of thy life but I was made acquainted with; and whil&s;t thou did&s;t triumph in the joys of my &s;ucce&s;sful illu&s;ion, I &s;ometimes
<PB N="232" REF="234">
pitied thy weakne&s;s, and &s;ometimes laughed at thy extravagance.</P>
<P>That magnificent palace of which thou thoughte&s;t thy&s;elf ma&s;ter, was one which I had borrowed for the purpo&s;e from an emir who was in my &s;ecret, and who was him&s;elf often pre&s;ent in di&s;gui&s;e among&s;t your &s;laves, a witne&s;s to your extravagancies. I will not encrea&s;e thy confu&s;ion by reminding thee of the in|ordinate exce&s;&s;es thou wert guilty of in thy retirement. Thou can&s;t not have forgot the project of creating for thy&s;elf an earthly paradi&s;e. This was the &s;e|cond cri&s;is I laid hold on to puni&s;h thee; and by tearing thee from thy impious plea&s;ures, to remind thee that crimes
<PB N="233" REF="235">
cannot be committed with impunity. A &s;econd &s;leep, procured as the former was, but of &s;omewhat a longer duration, gave me full opportunity to make a total change in the face of thy affairs. Ha&s;em (whom thou did&s;t &s;uppo&s;e to be dead) remained &s;till &s;ecretly concealed in thy hou&s;e, to be as it were the grand &s;pring to move all the re&s;t of thy dome&s;|tics. The hags whom thou had&s;t im|po&s;ed upon thee for the decayed beau|ties of thy &s;eraglio, were really a &s;et of notable old dames, whom he had tutored for the purpo&s;e: Thy former mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who were in&s;ignificant &s;laves, were di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed. She who per&s;onated the feigned Cadiga, acted her part to admiration, and with the artful contrivance of hav|ing
<PB N="234" REF="236">
a ro&s;e-bud painted on her brea&s;t, a mark which your young favourite really bore from nature, &s;he had cunning and addre&s;s enough to impo&s;e her&s;elf on you for the very Cadiga whom you formerly loved.</P>
<P>I believe, proceeded the &s;ultan, you are by this time convinced, that there was nothing &s;upernatural in the &s;everal events of your life, and that you were in reality nothing more than the dupe of your own folly and avarice.</P>
<P>Thou may&s;t remember after this pe|riod, that, &s;ated with voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, thy licentious heart began to grow har|dened; and from rioting without con|troul in plea&s;ures, which, however cri|minal
<PB N="235" REF="237">
in them&s;elves, carry at lea&s;t with them the excu&s;e of temptation, thou wantonly did&s;t &s;tir up, and indulge the latent cruelty of thy nature. Thy un|governed pa&s;&s;ions led thee to an act of blood! thou pierced&s;t with thy poniard the hone&s;t creature who remon&s;trated with thee on thy evil works; but Hea|ven did not, however, permit thee to deprive her of life.</P>
<P>See, Nourjahad, of what the heart of man is capable, when he &s;huts his eyes again&s;t the precepts of our holy prophet. Thou &s;tood&s;t as it were alone in the creation, and &s;elf-dependent for thy own happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, thou look|ed&s;t not for rewards or puni&s;hments in that invi&s;ible world, from which thou
<PB N="236" REF="238">
thoughte&s;t thy&s;elf by thy own voluntary act excluded.</P>
<P>This la&s;t barbarous deed, however, called aloud for cha&s;ti&s;ement; and thou wa&s;t for the third time deceived with a belief that thou had&s;t &s;lept a number of years, in which many mortifying revolu|tions had happened in thy family.</P>
<P>I was now re&s;olved to be my&s;elf an eye-witne&s;s of thy behaviour, and to try if there was any &s;park of virtue remain|ing in thy &s;oul which could po&s;&s;ibly be rekindled.</P>
<P>I di&s;gui&s;ed my&s;elf in the habit of a &s;lave; and having altered my face, and my voice, I pre&s;ented my&s;elf to thee under the name of Cozro. Thou know|e&s;t
<PB N="237" REF="239">
what pa&s;&s;ed between us on thy fir&s;t awaking from thy compelled &s;lumbers, and that I heard and &s;aw with what in|difference thou received&s;t the news of my &s;uppo&s;ed death. But I will not re|proach thee with ingratitude&mdash;let the memory of <HI>that</HI> be buried with the re&s;t of thy errors.</P>
<P>I had &s;oon the &s;atisfaction to find that thou wa&s;t as it were a new man. The natural goodne&s;s of thy di&s;po&s;ition, thy rea&s;on, thy experience of the deceitful|ne&s;s of wordly enjoyments, joined to the remor&s;e which thou could&s;t not help feeling, for a &s;eries of vice and folly, at length rouzed thee to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of what thou owed&s;t to the dignity of thy own nature, and to the duties incumbent on
<PB N="238" REF="240">
thee towards the re&s;t of thy fellow-crea|tures.</P>
<P>I now di&s;covered, with joy, that thou had&s;t intirely dive&s;ted thy&s;elf of that in|&s;atiable love of plea&s;ure, to which thou had&s;t before addicted thy&s;elf, and that thou no longer did&s;t regard wealth, but as it enabled thee to do good. There was but one trial more remained. If, &s;aid I, his repentance be &s;incere, and he has that heroi&s;m of mind which is in&s;e|parable from the truly virtuous, he will not &s;hrink at death; but, on the con|trary, will look upon it as the only means by which he can obtain tho&s;e refined enjoyments &s;uited to the divine part of his nature, and which are as much &s;u|perior
<PB N="239" REF="241">
in their e&s;&s;ence, as they are in their duration to all the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I made the trial&mdash;The glorious vic|tory, Oh Nourjahad, is thine! By thy contempt of riches, thou ha&s;t proved how well thou de&s;erved&s;t them; and thy readine&s;s to die, &s;hews how fit thou art to live.&mdash;</P>
<P>In the &s;pace of fourteen moons (for it is no longer &s;ince I fir&s;t impo&s;ed on thy credulity the belief of thy miraculous &s;tate) thou ha&s;t had the experience of four times &s;o many years. Such a&s;&s;uredly would be the vici&s;&s;itudes of thy life, had&s;t thou in reality po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed what thou did&s;t in imagination. Let this dream of exi&s;tence then be a le&s;&s;on to thee for the
<PB N="240" REF="242">
future, never to &s;uppo&s;e that riches can en&s;ure happine&s;s; that the gratification of our pa&s;&s;ions can &s;atisfy the human heart; or that the immortal part of our nature, will &s;uffer us to ta&s;te unmixed felicity, in a world which was never meant for our final place of abode. Take thy amiable Mandana to thee for a wife, and receive the fixed confidence and love of Schemzeddin.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory &s;ays that Nourjahad was from that minute rai&s;ed to be the fir&s;t man in power next to the &s;ultan; that his wi&s;dom and virtue proved an orna|ment and &s;upport to the throne of Per|&s;ia during the cour&s;e of a long and pro&s;|perous life; and that his name was fa|mous throughout the Ea&s;tern world.</P>
