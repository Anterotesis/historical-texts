<Q>Not for your &s;akes do I this, &s;aith the Lord God, be it known unto you: be a&s;hamed and confounded for your own ways, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</Q></HEAD>
<P>_IT is now &s;ome years &s;ince this nation entered into war again&s;t a powerful neighbour, in defence of rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;ecured to us by &s;acred and recent treaties, but treacherou&s;ly invaded and wre&s;t|ed from us. At the &s;ame time, a powerful combination of the mightie&s;t &s;tates in <HI>Europe,</HI> has been formed again&s;t an heroic prince, who is the glory of this age, and will be the wonder of po&s;terity; in who&s;e pre&s;ervation, we are deeply intere&s;ted, not only becau&s;e he is the ally of our gracious &s;overeign, but
<PB N="2" REF="3">
chiefly becau&s;e he is a main patron of that pure, reformed religion, which it is our hap|pine&s;s to have e&s;tabli&s;hed in our land; and which, zeal for truth, and concern for the pre&s;ent and eternal good of mankind ought to make us wi&s;h to continue and to &s;pread. Both we and our allies have had &s;ome expe|rience of the uncertainties of war, but far greater experience of the goodne&s;s of that God, who hath ble&s;&s;ed our arms with &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ignal, and almo&s;t unparalleled. This has re|joiced the heart of our good king; but he has not a&s;cribed it to the wi&s;dom of his own councils, or to the power of his numerous fleets and armies. Glorying in his allegiance to the <HI>king of kings,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 Tim. vi. 15.</NOTE> exulting in the light of his countenance, piou&s;ly acknowledging, that all his victories are the unde&s;erved gift of the <HI>only potentate</HI> of heaven and earth, and that his power alone can give him continued &s;ucce&s;s; he has called upon all his &s;ubjects in every
<PB N="3" REF="4">
part of his <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominions, to give thanks this day, with one heart, to him who is high|er than the highe&s;t, for that national pro&s;pe|rity which he has be&s;towed upon us. It be|comes us to accompany the expre&s;&s;ions of our fervent gratitude, with &s;incere and earne&s;t prayers, that God would continue to give us &s;ucce&s;s in war, while war mu&s;t la&s;t; and that he would &s;oon e&s;tabli&s;h peace on an equal, honourable, and permanent foundation. In this &s;ituation, I do not know any terms in which I can addre&s;s you more &s;uitably, either to the pious intention of our &s;overeign, or to the duty that is incumbent upon our&s;elves, than tho&s;e of the text: <HI>Not for your &s;akes do I this, &s;aith the Lord God, be it known unto you: be a&s;hamed and confounded for your own ways, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>IN the preceeding part of the chapter, the prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> had foretold, that the heathen nations, who had formerly oppre&s;&s;ed the chil|dren of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>; when they were &s;cattered a|mong
<PB N="4" REF="5">
them, &s;hould oppre&s;s them no more, but &s;hould be them&s;elves de&s;troyed; that the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;hould live in peace, and enjoy plenty in their own land; and that they &s;hould likewi&s;e enjoy the riche&s;t &s;piritu|al ble&s;&s;ings. He frequently, however, in the cour&s;e of this prediction, reminds them of their own ob&s;tinate wickedne&s;s; a&s;&s;ures them, that all this goodne&s;s was entirely unde&s;erv|ed, was the very oppo&s;ite of what their con|duct merited; and informs them, that it ought therefore to excite them to a deep repentance, and a thorough reformation. That the&s;e con|&s;iderations might make the deeper impre&s;&s;ion on them, he exhibits them in one view, in the words which we have read: from which I will take occa&s;ion to excite you to the duties which our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances demand, by pur&s;uing the following method.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I WILL turn your attention to <HI>this,</HI> which the Lord hath <HI>done</HI> for us; to the na|tional
<PB N="5" REF="6">
&s;ucce&s;&s;es, which ought this day to fill our hearts with gratitude to him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I WILL point out, how much the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are enhanced, and how much our gratitude ought to be inflamed by this circum&s;tance, that we were &s;o far from de|&s;erving them, as, on the contrary, to merit the &s;evere&s;t judgments. <HI>Not for your &s;akes do I this, &s;aith the Lord God, be it known unto you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I WILL &s;hew, how &s;trongly the&s;e public ble&s;&s;ings, be&s;towed upon us in our pre|&s;ent &s;ituation, &s;hould urge us to reformation. <HI>Be a&s;hamed and confounded for your own ways, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I WILL turn your attention to tho&s;e national &s;ucce&s;&s;es, which God hath be|&s;towed upon us, and which ought this day to fill our hearts with gratitude to him.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">GOD has, in all ages, given &s;ome nations much greater advantages than others. Each nation is apt to be partial to it&s;elf; but, after making all rea&s;onable allowances for this par|tiality, we may ju&s;tly &s;ay, that few nations have been &s;o highly favoured of heaven, in a free con&s;titution of government, in mild and equitable laws, and in purity of religion, as that in which we live. God has been, for ages pa&s;t, be&s;towing upon us, one national ble&s;&s;ing after another, often by means which &s;eemed to have a contrary tendency, 'till he has, at la&s;t, accumulated on us all that can render a people great and happy. It would require the whole day to enumerate, in the briefe&s;t manner, the publick ble&s;&s;ings which we now enjoy, or reap the happy con&s;equen|ces of. Your patience would be fatigued with hearing a rehear&s;al only of the ble&s;&s;ings of the pre&s;ent au&s;picious reign. I will therefore confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e, which are the peculiar &s;ubjects of this day's public thank&s;giving.
<PB N="7" REF="8">
Were I to de&s;cend to a particular detail even of them, I &s;hould convert a &s;ermon into an hi&s;tory of one of the mo&s;t &s;plendid periods of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> glory.</P>
<P>OUR &s;ucce&s;&s;es in the pre&s;ent war are li|mited within the compa&s;s of a very few years; but they are &s;o many and &s;o great, that they would have rendered a whole long reign illu|&s;trious. In every quarter of the world, the arms of <HI>Britain</HI> and its allies have been em|ployed; and wherever they have been em|ployed, they have been crowned with vic|tory. Our fleets have overcome, and our ar|mies have triumphed. Scarce had we time to rejoice in one &s;ucce&s;s, 'till it was almo&s;t driven out of our memory by a greater. We formed large expectations from the &s;pirit of our king, from the wi&s;dom and integrity of his mini&s;ters, and from the &s;kill and bravery of our commanders: but &s;ay, let any <HI>Briton</HI> &s;ay, did ever your mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes ri&s;e &s;o high as our real &s;ucce&s;s? We have exhau&s;ted the
<PB N="8" REF="9">
trea&s;ures of our enemies, and broken their power; but our riches are not dimini&s;hed, our force is not weakened. We have defeat|ed their de&s;igns to annoy us, and we have de|&s;tre&s;&s;ed them in their very gates. We began the war to defend our own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; we have not only defended them, but we have won from our enemies &s;trong fortre&s;&s;es, fer|tile i&s;lands, rich &s;ettlements, and va&s;t conti|nents. Our acqui&s;itions are not merely fit to gratify wild ambition, but are u&s;eful for the enlargement of our commerce, for the increa&s;e of our riches, for the &s;ecurity of the lives of our fellow-&s;ubjects in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> colonies, and for extending the pure, reformed religion over large tracts of country. They are won from a nation, which is our rival in power and trade, and the enemy of our religion and liberty; which has often attempted to &s;et a popi&s;h pretender, the de&s;cendant of a tyrant, who derives his claim from the principles of &s;lavery, upon the throne of the&s;e kingdoms; and which is at pre&s;ent engaged in a confede|racy,
<PB N="9" REF="10">
to extirpate the prote&s;tant religion from <HI>Germany,</HI> and to oppre&s;s that hero, whom God hath rai&s;ed for its defence.</P>
<P>BUT if the number, the quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the important nature of our &s;ucce&s;&s;es do not enough excite your joy and your gratitude, attend to the circum&s;tances, which render them more a&s;toni&s;hing.</P>
<P>WHEN this war began, <HI>Britain</HI> had but one ally; and he was by his &s;ituation incapa|ble of aiding her with a naval force, and by his circum&s;tances at that time, unable to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance in any way. <HI>Britain</HI> was de&s;erted by her ancient friends, for whom &s;he had ne|ver &s;pared her blood or trea&s;ure, who owed their very being to her un&s;haken faithfulne&s;s. They were even &s;o ungrateful as to join with <HI>France,</HI> and laboured to oppre&s;s our only al|ly. Our enemies had, in the mid&s;t of peace, advanced far in making preparations for wa|ging war with advantage. <HI>Britain,</HI> faithful to treaty, and void of &s;u&s;picion that tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions
<PB N="10" REF="11">
would be attacked, which were &s;ecured by its &s;acred ties, had taken no &s;teps for its own defence. It had its armies to &s;end to its di&s;tant colonies, when they had need to be already in the field. And for &s;ome time we &s;eemed to &s;uffer by that want of prepara|tion, which un&s;u&s;picious hone&s;ty had occa&s;i|oned.</P>
<P>ARMIES were &s;ent to our colonies; and they were cut to pieces. Fleets were &s;ent on one &s;ervice; but the &s;ea&s;on for it was expired: they were &s;ent on another; but cowardice or infatuation &s;eized them. We were threaten|ed with an inva&s;ion at home; we were de|ceived by the threats, and left part of our fo|reign dominions an ea&s;y prey to our rapaci|ous enemies. Our brave ally was hemmed in, on every hand, by many armies, each of which &s;eemed more than &s;ufficient to &s;wal|low him up. Endeavouring to extricate him|&s;elf from pre&s;&s;ing difficulties, he &s;everal times
<PB N="11" REF="12">
lo&s;t part of his little army, whom he could ill &s;pare; and &s;uffered defeats, which made all, but his own great &s;oul, give him up for lo&s;t. An illu&s;trious prince, who in his youth had chaced rebellion from our land, was not able, with the wi&s;dom of maturer age, to protect the electoral dominions of his royal father from the cruel ravages of our enemies, or to hinder them from &s;eizing them as their pro|perty. God &s;eemed to fight again&s;t us. The whole nation was &s;unk into feeblene&s;s and de&s;pondence. Wi&s;e coun&s;els were nece&s;&s;ary; but faction ob&s;tructed them. Vigour was re|qui&s;ite; but indolence and effeminacy had &s;eized every heart.</P>
<P>To the&s;e de&s;perate circum&s;tances we were once reduced; but from them our glory &s;prung. Danger bani&s;hed faction; wi&s;e coun&s;els were concerted, and vigorous mea&s;ures were re&s;olv|ed on. Abilities appeared both in the coun|cil,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
and in the camp, which &s;eemed to de&s;erve an opportunity of &s;aving a nation from de|&s;truction, in order to di&s;play them. Former mi&s;takes gave ri&s;e to the be&s;t propo&s;als. For|mer misbehaviours were &s;ucceeded by won|ders of conduct and of courage. Our generals and our allies were reduced to difficulties, on|ly that they might &s;urmount them with the greater glory. A de&s;perate &s;ituation &s;eemed only de&s;igned to render a victory more cer|tain and complete. Our very lo&s;&s;es removed circum&s;tances, which would have ob&s;tructed our gaining greater advantages. <HI>Five have chaced an hundred, and an hundred have put ten thou&s;and to flight.</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Lev. xxvi. 8.</NOTE> And let us not forget that, while our country has been carrying on war with &s;ucce&s;s &s;o unparalleled, we have never once felt the dangers or lo&s;&s;es of war. While others have been expo&s;ed to its fury, our per|&s;ons and our fortunes have been &s;ecure. O|thers
<PB N="13" REF="14">
have hazarded their lives; but we have enjoyed the &s;weets of peace, in the mid&s;t of war. And to the profounde&s;t quiet, the rich|e&s;t plenty has been &s;uperadded. Our cam|paigns have abounded in conque&s;t; and our &s;ea&s;ons have excelled in fertility.</P>
<P>CAN you con&s;ider all this, my friends, and not rejoice? I will not check your joy. But let it not be light or di&s;&s;ipated; let it not re&s;t in the mere view of the advantages, which our country has gained. I will not attempt to le&s;|&s;en your regard or your veneration for tho&s;e, to whom we owe the&s;e illu&s;trious tran&s;actions. The brave hero, the dear friend, the belov|ed kin&s;man, who have &s;hed their blood in their country's cau&s;e, demand a tear from e|very <HI>Briton.</HI> The bold &s;ailor, the daring &s;ol|dier, the intrepid commander, the wi&s;e &s;tate&s;|man, the gracious &s;overeign, who have been the in&s;truments of our glory, de&s;erve our gra|titude
<PB N="14" REF="15">
and our prayers. But who is the fir&s;t cau&s;e of all? <HI>I do this,</HI> &s;aith the Lord, our God. Could &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;es have fallen to our &s;hare, if the <HI>Lord of ho&s;ts</HI> had not fought with us? Who is &s;o blind, as not to perceive his pro|vidence in the &s;urpri&s;ing turns of &s;ucce&s;s? Who is it that could have di&s;concerted our be&s;t laid &s;chemes by a cro&s;s accident, and has not? <HI>Who ruleth the raging of the &s;ea,</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxxxix. 9.</NOTE> and has hin|dred it from &s;wallowing up our navies? Who has &s;teeled the &s;ailor's and the &s;oldier's heart again&s;t the attacks of fear? Who has be&s;tow|ed upon us generals po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of greater milita|ry &s;kill in early youth, than mo&s;t can acquire in a whole life-time? Who has given us com|manders, who exert the valour and activity of health and youth, amid&s;t the di&s;courage|ments of excruciating pain, or the di&s;heart|ening infirmities of old age? Who has rai&s;ed up, in the&s;e degenerate days, a mini&s;ter, actu|ated by the di&s;intere&s;ted and incorruptible and &s;teady principles of an old republican? Who
<PB N="15" REF="16">
has ca&s;t into this age, and engaged on our &s;ide a prince greater than any whom hi&s;tory has recorded? Who has enabled him to &s;tand alone again&s;t the united power of mighty em|pires? Who has been a &s;hield to him in the heat of many battles, when <HI>a thou&s;and have fallen at his &s;ide, and ten thou&s;and at his right hand?</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xci. 7.</NOTE> Who has pre&s;erved the life of our gracious king, ever an important, but at the pre&s;ent juncture a mo&s;t important life? It is only God. <HI>Our help is in the name of the Lord.</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxxiv. 8.</NOTE> To him let us a&s;cribe our ble&s;&s;ings: to him let us this day give hearty prai&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">II. To excite us &s;till more to this; to en|hance our mercies, and to inflame our grati|tude, let us con&s;ider, in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, as was propo&s;ed, that we were &s;o far from de|&s;erving &s;o &s;ignal ble&s;&s;ings, as, on the contrary, to merit the &s;evere&s;t judgments. <HI>Not for your &s;akes do I this, &s;aith the Lord God, be it known unto you.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">THAT God, who&s;e ju&s;tice will never per|mit him to puni&s;h either an individual or a nation, except they de&s;erve it, is &s;o abundant in goodne&s;s, that he very often be&s;tows ble&s;|&s;ings, both on individuals and on nations, when they are mo&s;t unde&s;erving. Did he not, could <HI>Britain</HI> be, at this day, &s;o pro&s;perous and happy? Our &s;ucce&s;&s;es and our ble&s;&s;ings are almo&s;t unequalled: but is our virtue un|equalled too?</P>
<P>I INTEND not to load our national cha|racter with every kind of vice. I hope truth will not permit it. This is a day of gladne&s;s, and forbids me to bring forth all our real abo|minations into light. I will not affect to di&s;|&s;emble that we have many national virtues. I will mention, to the honour of our coun|try, the high &s;en&s;e of liberty, and manly gene|ro&s;ity of &s;entiment, which we po&s;&s;e&s;s; our faithfulne&s;s in our alliances; our &s;crupulous adherence to treaties. I will own, that, far from &s;tirring up unju&s;t war, we are even back|ward
<PB N="17" REF="18">
to engage in that which is nece&s;&s;ary: that, when the mon&s;ter war mu&s;t be let loo&s;e, we are at pains to re&s;train it from exerting its utmo&s;t fury; that we hate barbarity in the field and exerci&s;e humanity to pri&s;oners. I will ac|knowlege that the cau&s;e for which we fight is ju&s;t and glorious, the defence of our own rights, the protection of the faith of treaties, the curb|ing of boundle&s;s ambition, and the &s;upport of a firm patron of the prote&s;tant religion.</P>
<P>BUT can we in all this find merit adequate to &s;uch pro&s;perity? Or is there nothing to counterballance our virtues? A ju&s;t cau&s;e is a ground for our hopes and prayers, but gives us no right to &s;ucce&s;s. The highe&s;t national virtue is only what we owe in &s;tricte&s;t duty to the almighty king of nations; is but an im|perfect return of gratitude for the public mer|cies tran&s;mitted to us by our ance&s;tors. But mu&s;t not the mo&s;t favourable judgment deter|mine that we are far from an&s;wering the calls of duty and of gratitude? We enjoy the be&s;t
<PB N="18" REF="19">
con&s;titution of government under heaven; do we prize it &s;ufficiently? are we enough thank|ful to God for it? do we &s;tudy to promote general union and harmony? do we never turn our liberty into licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and di&s;|content and faction? do the governed &s;how continually that public &s;pirit, which would unite them in pur&s;uing the public intere&s;t, without obliging the rulers to u&s;e corruption? or is there no in&s;tance in which this engine is employed to induce men to what is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the common good? We enjoy chri&s;tianity in its pure&s;t form. We are free from <HI>the commandments of men,</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Matth. xv. 9.</NOTE> from the im|po&s;itions of bigots, and from the vain traditi|ons of artful or weak mortals. But do none among us therefore affect a freedom al&s;o from <HI>the commandments of God,</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Mat. xv. 6.</NOTE> and from <HI>the faith which was once delivered unto the &s;aints?</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Jude 3.</NOTE> Has the purity of the go&s;pel protected our land from infidelity? We are delivered from that burden of u&s;ele&s;s ceremonies, which once di|verted
<PB N="19" REF="20">
the care of men from the real duties of religion; but has removal of them con|centered and invigorated our endeavours to practi&s;e genuine piety and virtue? Is our practice of religion purer and more blamele&s;s than that of our neighbours, who retain popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition? Do we &s;how a deeper &s;en&s;e of God and a greater reverence of his name? Are we more con&s;tant in our attendance on his wor&s;hip, or more fervent in our manner of performing it? I fear the rever&s;e is true, to our confu&s;ion. Our commerce is exten|&s;ive; but is it always carried on with fairne&s;s and equity? We enjoy plenty; but do none abu&s;e it as food to luxury and debauchery, as materials of extravagance, as means of per|petual di&s;&s;ipation? Have our &s;oldiers and our &s;ailors, on who&s;e valour our defence immedi|ately depends, that religious tru&s;t in God, which alone can render valour rational? Our public ble&s;&s;ings have been long continued with us; but have we even yet learned to improve
<PB N="20" REF="21">
them? We have &s;ometimes been threatened with the lo&s;s of them; but has the fear of lo|&s;ing them awakened us to u&s;e them pro|perly?</P>
<P>Do not the&s;e &s;ins naturally demand judg|ments for the puni&s;hment of them, the rever&s;e of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, from the abu&s;e of which they have &s;prung? But God heaps new ble&s;|&s;ings upon us, and gives us new &s;ecurity for tho&s;e which we have long enjoyed. Can we recollect that his goodne&s;s is &s;o unde&s;erved, and yet feel no gratitude in our hearts? Can the highe&s;t gratitude equal the occa&s;ion? Does not the remembrance of our unworthine&s;s properly belong to the duty of this day, when it tends &s;o &s;trongly to inflame our gratitude? It likewi&s;e tends to give it a right direction, to keep it from &s;pending it&s;elf in a tran&s;ient rapture, to render it &s;o &s;edate and fixed, that it may remain in the heart, and produce la&s;t|ing fruits.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="21" REF="22">III. THIS brings us to the <HI>la&s;t</HI> thing pro|po&s;ed, to &s;hew how &s;trongly the&s;e public ble&s;&s;ings, be&s;towed upon us in our pre&s;ent &s;i|tuation, urge us to reformation.</P>
<P>WE de&s;erve judgments; God &s;howers down his riche&s;t ble&s;&s;ings on us; they cannot be rewards of our righteou&s;ne&s;s; for what purpo&s;e then are they be&s;towed, but to be motives to repentance and obedience?</P>
<P>COMPARE God's continued ble&s;&s;ings be|&s;towed on us, with the continued provocati|ons which we have given him in return; and &s;ay, can we have the &s;malle&s;t &s;park of ingenu|ity, if we be not <HI>a&s;hamed and confounded for our own ways?</HI> Do the&s;e &s;ins, which abound a|mong us, become that nation, whom God ap|pears to have cho&s;en for his peculiar favour|ite? We had indulged heinous &s;ins; yet God ble&s;&s;ed us. Should not ingenuity have moved us, whenever he began to ble&s;s us, to blu&s;h
<PB N="22" REF="23">
for our former misbehaviours towards him, and to turn immediately to the mo&s;t dutiful and exemplary obedience of his laws? He has gone on to ble&s;s us hitherto, and we have hitherto gone on to &s;in again&s;t him. Will we not at length be &s;truck with &s;hame, and for|&s;ake our &s;ins? An ingenuous mind is mo&s;t effectually touched with returns of good for evil; there is no genero&s;ity in that &s;oul, which is inacce&s;&s;ible to their impre&s;&s;ions. God &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e by his dealings with us, that the &s;ons of <HI>Britain</HI> are liberal minds. Will we &s;how that we are unworthy of the character, by continuing ob&s;tinate in our &s;ins, in &s;pite of all the good that he can do us? This were in|deed to prove our&s;elves da&s;tardly &s;pirits, in&s;en|&s;ible of every thing but the rod, incapable of be|ing reclaimed, except by the &s;evere&s;t judgments.</P>
<P>BUT if we have not ingenuity enough to be &s;oothed into our duty, let us con&s;ider that God's unde&s;erved favours, if they be mi&s;im|proved, will aggravate our guilt, and may

provoke him yet to change the face of things. Hitherto we and our confederates have been &s;ucce&s;sful; but the war is not ended. Our Illu&s;trious ally is yet &s;urrounded by all the &s;ame mighty powers, whom, in the begin|ning of the war, we reckoned able to ruin him by a &s;ingle battle. It is only the memory of the miracles of providence, which God has wrought for him, that hinders us from being &s;till of the &s;ame opinion. His foes are not exhau&s;ted, but he is weakened. His precious life is continually expo&s;ed to greater danger than the meane&s;t &s;oldier. Good God &s;hield him from every weapon! for &s;hould he fall, the con&s;equences are too dreadful for us to bear to dwell upon them! That nation again&s;t whom we are engaged in war, has large re|&s;ources, and its king has ab&s;olute power to render them effectual. Our enemies may be rendered de&s;perate; and what invincible ef|forts will not de&s;pair &s;ometimes produce? They already threaten to carry the &s;eat of
<PB N="24" REF="25">
war into our own country. We have been alarmed with the fears of it; but we have hitherto dwelt in &s;afety. As long as the war continues we are in danger. Should they be allowed to execute their threatenings, then we &s;hould know indeed, what a judgment it is to be engaged in war. But tho' we &s;hould e&s;cape the di&s;a&s;ters which ari&s;e from the vici&s;&s;itudes of war, are there not a thou&s;and ways, in which God may bla&s;t in an in&s;tant all the mercies, which he has heaped upon us? And may not ingratitude for ble&s;&s;ings &s;o &s;ignal, and impenitence towards &s;o bountiful a God, ju&s;t|ly provoke him to vi&s;it us with a &s;ad rever&s;e?</P>
<P>BUT tho' he &s;hould continue our national pro&s;perity, tho' he &s;hould, <HI>not for our righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, but for the wickedne&s;s</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Deut. ix. 5.</NOTE> of our enemies, or to accompli&s;h &s;ome great good purpo&s;e of his own, drive them &s;till before us; yet be a&s;|&s;ured that every individual among us, who is not rou&s;ed by our public advantages to an in|genuous

&s;hame for his own per&s;onal &s;ins, and to &s;incere reformation from them, will be pu|ni&s;hed hereafter for his ingratitude. The per|&s;onal &s;ins of the &s;everal individuals compo&s;e the national wickedne&s;s. It is only the refor|mation of each particular per&s;on, that can re|form the nation. It is incumbent on each of us to take care of his own part. Every one &s;hares in our publick ble&s;&s;ings; to every one they &s;hould be arguments for repentance and obedience; and they will aggravate the future puni&s;hment of every particular per&s;on, by whom they are not thus improved.</P>
<P>IN a word, the ble&s;&s;ings which God has be&s;towed on our country are great and &s;in|gular: They demand our heartie&s;t thankful|ne&s;s to him: They demand it the rather, be|cau&s;e they are unde&s;erved: They call upon us to be ill-de&s;erving no longer: They will ag|gravate our future ill-de&s;ert: God will pu|ni&s;h it, if not in this life, yet certainly in ano|ther. I will conclude with God's addre&s;s to

the people of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> which is equally applica|ble to us, and which contains the &s;um of what I have been &s;aying: <HI>What nation is there &s;o great, who hath God &s;o nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things, that we call upon him for? And what nation is like this people, for whom God doth great things and terrible? Only take heed to thy&s;elf and keep thy &s;oul diligently, le&s;t thou forget the things which thine eyes have &s;een, and le&s;t they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life.</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Deut. iv. 7. 9. 2.
