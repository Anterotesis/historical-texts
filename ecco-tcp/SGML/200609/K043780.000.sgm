<HEAD>REASONS
Humbly Offer'd
By the Company exerci&s;ing the
Trade and Mi&s;tery of UPHOL|DERS,
again&s;t Part of the
BILL, <HI>For the better Viewing,
Searching and Examining Drugs,
Medicines, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEING call'd upon by &s;everal Retailers
and Di&s;pen&s;ers of Drugs and Medicines
about Town, to u&s;e our Endeavours a|gain&s;t
the Bill now depending, <HI>for Viewing,</HI> &amp;c.
In Regard of our common Intere&s;t and in Gra|titude
to the &s;aid Retailers and Di&s;pen&s;ers of
Medicines (which we have always found to be
<PB N="2" REF="4">
very effectual) we pre&s;ume to lay the following
Rea&s;ons before the Publick, again&s;t the &s;aid Bill.</P>
<P>That the Company of Upholders <HI>are far
from being aver&s;e to the giving of Drugs and
Medicines in general,</HI> provided they may be of
&s;uch Qualities as we require, and admini&s;ter'd
by &s;uch Per&s;ons in whom our Company ju&s;tly
repo&s;e the greate&s;t Confidence: And provided
they tend to the Encouragement of Trade, and
the Con&s;umption of the Woolen Manufacture
of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>We beg Leave to ob&s;erve, that <HI>there hath
been no Complaint from any of the Nobility, Gen|try
and Citizens whom we have attended.</HI> Our
Practice, which con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in outward Ap|plications,
having been always &s;o effectual, that
none of our Patients have been oblig'd to un|dergo
a &s;econd Operation. Excepting one Gen|tlewoman;
who, after her fir&s;t Burial, having,
burthen'd her Husband with a new Brood of
po&s;thumous Children, her &s;econd Funeral was
by us perform'd without any further Charges to
<PB N="3" REF="5">
the &s;aid Husband of the deceas'd. And we hum|bly
hope, that one &s;ingle In&s;tance of this Kind
(a Misfortune owing meerly to the Avarice of
a Sexton in cutting off a Ring) will not be im|puted,
to any Want of Skill, or Care in our
Company.</P>
<P>We humbly conceive, that this <HI>Power, by
this Bill lodged in the Cen&s;ors of the College of
Phy&s;icians,</HI> to re&s;train any of His Maje&s;ty's Sub|jects
from di&s;pen&s;ing, and well-di&s;po&s;ed Per|&s;ons
from taking what Medicines they plea&s;e, <HI>is
a manife&s;t Encroachment on the Liberty and Pro|perty
of the Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>As the Company exerci&s;ing the Trade and
Mi&s;tery of Upholders, have an undi&s;puted Right
in and upon the Bodies of all and every the
Subjects of the Kingdom; we conceive the pa&s;|&s;ing
of this Bill, though not ab&s;olutely depri|ving
them of their &s;aid Right, might keep them
out of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by unrea&s;onable Delays, to the
great Detriment of our Company and their nu|merous
Families.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">
We hope it will be con&s;ider'd that there are
Multitudes of nece&s;&s;itous Heirs and penurious
Parents, Per&s;ons in pinching Circum&s;tances,
with numerous Families of Children, Wives that
have lived long, many robu&s;t aged Women
with great Jointures, elder Brothers with bad
Under&s;tandings, &s;ingle Heirs of great E&s;tates,
whereby the Collateral Line are for ever exclu|ded,
Rever&s;ionary Patents, and Rever&s;ionary
Promi&s;es of Preferments, Lea&s;es upon Single
Lives, and Play-debts upon joint Lives, and
that the Per&s;ons &s;o agrieved have no Hope of
being &s;peedily relieved any other Way, than by
the di&s;pen&s;ing of Drugs and Medicines in the
Manner they now are; Burying alive being
judg'd repugnant to the know Laws of this
Kingdom.</P>
<P>That there are many of the Decea&s;ed, who
by certain mechanical Motions and Powers are
carried about Town, who would have been put
into our Hands long before this Time by any
other well-ordered Government; by want of a
<PB N="5" REF="7">
due Police in this Particular, our Company
have been great Sufferers.</P>
<P>That frequent Funerals contribute to pre&s;erve
the Genealogies of Families, and the Honours
conferred by the Crown, (which are no where
&s;o well illu&s;trated as on this &s;olemn Occa&s;ion;)
to maintain nece&s;&s;itous Clergy, to enable the
Clerks to appear in decent Habits to officiate
on <HI>Sundays,</HI> to feed the great Retinue of &s;ober
and melancholy Men who appear at the &s;aid
Funerals, and who mu&s;t &s;tarve without con|&s;tant
and regular Employment. Moreover we
de&s;ire it may be remember'd, that by the pa&s;&s;ing
of this Bill the Nobility and Gentry will have
their old Coaches lie upon their Hands, which
are now employed by our Company.</P>
<P>And we further hope that frequent Funerals
will not be di&s;couraged (as is by this Bill pro|po&s;ed)
it being the only Method left of <HI>carry|ing</HI>
&s;ome People to Church.</P>
<P>We are afraid that by the Hard&s;hips of this
<PB N="6" REF="8">
Bill our Company will be reduced to leave
their Bu&s;ine&s;s here, and <HI>practi&s;e at</HI> York <HI>and</HI>
Bri&s;tol, <HI>where the free U&s;e of bad Medicines
will be &s;till allowed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is therefore hoped that no &s;pecious Pretence
what&s;oever will be thought &s;ufficient to introduce
an Arbitrary and unlimited Power for People to
live</HI> (in Defiance of Art) as long as they can
by the Cour&s;e of Nature, to the Prejudice of
our Company, and the Decay of Trade.</P>
<P>That as our Company are like to &s;uffer in
&s;ome mea&s;ure by the Power given to Phy&s;icians
to di&s;&s;ect the Bodies of Malefactors, we hum|bly
hope that the Manufacture of Ca&s;es for
Skeletons will be re&s;erved &s;olely to the Coffin|makers.</P>
<P>We likewi&s;e humbly pre&s;ume that the Inte|re&s;ts
of the &s;everal Trades and Profe&s;&s;ions which
depend upon ours, may be regarded; &s;uch as
that of the Makers of Hear&s;es, Coaches, Cof|fins,
Epitaphs, and Bell-ropes; Stone-cutters,
<PB N="7" REF="9">
Feather-men and Bell-ringers; and e&s;pecially
the Manufacturers of Crapes; and the Makers
of Snuff, who u&s;e great Quantities of old-Coffins,
and who, con&s;idered in the Con&s;umpti|on
of their Drugs, employ by far the greate&s;t
Number of Hands of any Manufacture of the
Kingdom.</P>
