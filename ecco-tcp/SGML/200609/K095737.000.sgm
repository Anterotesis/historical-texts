<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY pen, wearied of tracing &s;ucce&s;&s;ive pictures of human crimes and human ca|lamity, pur&s;ues its ta&s;k with reluctance; while my heart &s;prings forward to that fairer epocha which now beams upon the friends of liberty&mdash;that epocha when the French republic has ca&s;t a&s;ide her di&s;mal &s;hroud, &s;tained with the blood of the patriot, and bathed with the tears of the mourner; and pre&s;ents the ble&s;&s;ed images of ju&s;tice and humanity healing the deep wounds of her afflicted bo&s;om: when the laws of mercy are but the echo
<PB N="2" REF="3">
of the public opinion, of that loud cry for the triumph of innocence, of that horror of tyranny which hangs upon every lip, and thrills at every heart. The generous affections, the tender &s;ympa|thies &s;o long repre&s;&s;ed by the congealing &s;tupefaction of terror, bur&s;t forth with uncontrolable energy; and the enthu&s;ia&s;m of humanity has taken place of the gloomy terror of de&s;pair, as &s;uddenly as, when the ma&s;&s;y ice di&s;&s;olves in the re|gions of the north, &s;ummer awakens her clear rills, her fre&s;h foliage and her lux|uriant flowers. Not to have &s;uffered per&s;ecution during the tyranny of Robe&s;|pierre, is now to be di&s;graced; and it is expected of all tho&s;e who have e&s;caped that they &s;hould a&s;&s;ign &s;ome good rea&s;on, or offer &s;ome &s;atisfactory apology for their &s;u&s;picious exemption from impri&s;onment. An ecrou<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An extract from the Jailor's Regi&s;ter.</NOTE> is con&s;idered as a certificate
<PB N="3" REF="4">
of <HI>civi&s;m,</HI> and is a nece&s;&s;ary introduction to good &s;ociety. But happy, thrice hap|py is he who has been immured in a dungeon, and has been unfortunate be|yond the common lot! To him the &s;ocial circle li&s;tens with attention, for him the tender beauty wakes her &s;ofte&s;t &s;mile&mdash;for him await all private and public honours; he may lay claim to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the highe&s;t offices of the &s;tate, and may a&s;pire in proportion as he has &s;uffered. The tide of &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion has indeed run &s;o high, that it has been ob&s;erved to produce a &s;ort of affectation of complaint in ordinary minds; and as it was &s;aid in the depart|ments after the taking of the Ba&s;tile, that every Pari&s;ian who came into the coun|try, declared him&s;elf one of the con|querors, and mo&s;t of them had even &s;eized De Launy by the &s;houlder, &s;o at pre&s;ent if we were to lend our belief to
<PB N="4" REF="5">
all tho&s;e who tell us they were on the fatal li&s;t de&s;tined for the guillotine on the 11th of Thermidor, the day after Ro|be&s;pierre's execution, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that his appointed hecatomb for that day con&s;i&s;ted, in&s;tead of his ordinary &s;acri|fice, of half Paris at lea&s;t. But after all the cruelties that have pa&s;&s;ed, how &s;oothing is the moment when pity becomes the fa&s;hion, and when tyranny is &s;o execrated that to have been its victim is glory! The tears of compa&s;&s;ion now flow even for tho&s;e objects whom once to commi&s;e|rate was death. A republican may now, un&s;u&s;pected of royali&s;m, lament the fate of the innocent and intere&s;ting &s;ufferer at the Temple; &s;he, who&s;e birth-day was a day of triumph, who&s;e cradle was &s;trewed with flowers, and who now, im|mured within a living tomb, remains the &s;ole &s;urvivor of her unfortunate family. The pro&s;pect of her &s;peedy relea&s;e from
<PB N="5" REF="6">
captivity gives perhaps as general plea|&s;ure at Paris as at Vienna. This &s;ympa|thy is not confined to tho&s;e per&s;ons who wi&s;h to replace her family upon the throne; for cruelty is no longer the order of the day, and the mo&s;t deter|mined lover of democracy may now, without offending again&s;t its laws, pro|fe&s;s his pity for a blooming beauty con|fined in gloomy towers, although &s;he happens to be a prince&s;s. That fair mourner, while &s;he waits the hour of li|berty and happine&s;s, is no longer enclo&s;ed in di&s;mal &s;olitude within the walls of her apartment. For &s;ome weeks pa&s;t &s;he has &s;pent as much of the day as &s;he choo&s;es in the gardens of the Temple, and her confinement has been cheered by the &s;ociety of an amiable and accom|pli&s;hed lady, madame de Chatrenne, to whom &s;he is much attached, and who cheats the hours of their length by teach|ing her Italian and drawing. She often
<PB N="6" REF="7">
enquires after her unhappy family, of who&s;e fate, except that of her father, &s;he is altogether ignorant; but every enquiry &s;he makes concerning them, madame de Chatrenne is obliged to an&s;wer in con|formity to the orders &s;he has received from the committee of general &s;afety, by telling her, "this is a &s;ecret of &s;tate." And &s;urely it is merciful to conceal from her events which have pa&s;&s;ed, till &s;he is placed in a &s;ituation where her tears will be wiped away with the tenderne&s;s of a&s;&s;iduous attention, and the &s;ympathy of congenial &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Paris once more rea&s;&s;umes a gay a&s;|pect, the poor again have bread, and the rich again di&s;play the appendages of wealth. The proce&s;&s;ions of death which once darkened the &s;treets, are now &s;uc|ceeded by carriages elegant in &s;implicity, though not decorated with the blazonry of arms, or the lace of liveries. The cheerfulne&s;s habitual to pari&s;ian phy&s;iog|nomy,
<PB N="7" REF="8">
again lights up its reviving look; and the quick &s;tep, the joyous &s;mile, the &s;mart repartee, the airy ge&s;ture, have &s;ucceeded the di&s;mal re&s;erve, and the trembling circum&s;pection which &s;o ill &s;uited the national character. With the carele&s;s &s;implicity of children who after the rigours of &s;chool ha&s;ten to their &s;ports; the Pari&s;ians, &s;haking off the hideous remembrance of the pa&s;t, fly to the &s;cenes of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Thuilleries and the Champs-Ely|l&eacute;es are again crowded with the &s;pright|ly circles &s;eated on each &s;ide of their broad alleys, and beneath the &s;hade of their maje&s;tic trees. At the period of great &s;carcity of bread, when crowds a&s;|&s;embled every morning at the doors of the bakers &s;hops, the people called it going <HI>&agrave; la queue.</HI> Tho&s;e <HI>queues,</HI> or ranks, in &s;earch of bread have long &s;ince cea&s;ed, and are &s;ucceeded by <HI>queues</HI> in &s;earch of plea&s;ure. There is a <HI>queue</HI> every even|ing
<PB N="8" REF="9">
at every theatre; and the late per&s;e|cution of the roman catholic church having produced the u&s;ual effect of per|&s;ecution, there is a <HI>queue</HI> at the churches every &s;unday to hear ma&s;s. For &s;ome time during the &s;pring, there was a vio|lent &s;chi&s;m at Paris between tho&s;e who cho&s;e to make a holiday of &s;unday, and tho&s;e who ob&s;erved the decadi as a fe&s;ti|val. The town was nearly equally di|vided between what were called the <HI>Da|minicans,</HI> and the <HI>Decadi&s;ts.</HI> One half of the trade&s;men &s;hut up their &s;hops, and one half of the mechanics refu&s;ed to work on one day, the other half on the other. At length the matter has been compromi&s;ed in the manner mo&s;t agree|able to a people &s;o fond of amu&s;ement as the Pari&s;ians, by making merry both on &s;unday and decadi. Each day is become a holiday, on which churches, theatres, and public gardens are alike crowded, and all the world appears &s;atisfied.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">
The women indulge in their dre&s;s the full extent of female caprice, as well as extravagance. This day the peruque blonde<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A light-haired periwig.</NOTE> converts the dark-complexioned nymph into a fair beauty; tomorrow &s;he rea&s;&s;umes her jetty locks, and thus varies her attractions.</P>
<Q><L>How many pictures of one nymph we view,</L>
<L>All how unlike each other, all how true!</L></Q>
<P>Some lances were &s;hivered lately be|tween the lovers of the Mar&s;eillois hymn, and the <HI>amateurs</HI> of the reveil du peu|ple; but ho&s;tilities have now cea&s;ed in the &s;ame manner as between &s;unday and de|cadi, by making it a rule to &s;ing both.</P>
<P>In the mean time literature and the arts, covered with fack-cloth and a&s;hes during the reign of our jacobin vandals, again revive, the national library offers every other day its trea&s;ures of literature to the public, and its long galleries and ample tables are filled with per&s;ons of
<PB N="10" REF="11">
both &s;exes, who, amid&s;t the &s;ilence which is there ob&s;erved, enjoy the charms of meditation, or the plea&s;ure of &s;tudy.</P>
<P>The noble gallery of the national mu&s;eum filled with the ma&s;ter-pieces of art, is crowded three times a decade with citizens of all cla&s;&s;es, the poor as well as the rich; who cannot fail to humanize their &s;ouls, as well as improve their ta&s;te by &s;uch contemplation. The celebrated &s;culptured hor&s;es of Marly now decorate the entrance of the Champs-Ely&s;&eacute;es; the porticoes of the Louvre are filled with &s;tatues; the public walks are pre&s;erved with attentive care; and Paris, &s;o lately be&s;meared with blood&mdash;Paris, the refuge of barbari&s;m, and the den of carnage, once more excites the ideas of ta&s;te, ele|gance, refinement, and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But whither am I wandering? Before we reach tho&s;e fair and cheerful regions, we mu&s;t pa&s;s through the nethermo&s;t aby&s;s <Q><PB N="11" REF="12">
<L>Of Chaos, and his dark pavilion &s;pread</L>
<L>Wide on the wa&s;teful deep; with him enthroned</L>
<L>Sat fable-ve&s;ted Night, and by them &s;tand</L>
<L>Orcus and Ades; and the dreaded name</L>
<L>Of Demogorgon; Rumour next, and Chance,</L>
<L>And Tumult and Confu&s;ion all embroiled,</L>
<L>And Di&s;cord with a thou&s;and various mouths&mdash;</L>
<L>Alone, and without guide, half-lo&s;t, I &s;eek the readie&s;t path.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the conclu&s;ion of my la&s;t letter I mentioned that plan of &s;preading deva&s;|tation, through the wide territory of the Vend&eacute;e, which had entered into the councils of the committee of public &s;afety. The &s;ad ta&s;k remains of relat|ing how &s;ucce&s;sfully they accompli&s;hed their purpo&s;e. The character of the Vendean has been always repre&s;ented as &s;imple, humane and ru&s;tic; the dupe of the prie&s;t, and the &s;lave of the noble. Had the convention, in&s;tead of &s;ending the &s;word, &s;ent peace; in&s;tead of bayo|nets and &s;oldiers, had they di&s;patched apo&s;tles with mi&s;&s;als of republicani&s;m,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
there is little doubt but this numerous and valuable part of community would long &s;ince have formed an integral part of the republic. "The&s;e people," one of the mountain deputies, Dubois Cranc&eacute;, ob&s;erves, in &s;peaking of the Vendeans, "are the mo&s;t re&s;pectable I have ever known; they attend to ju&s;tice and rea|&s;on, when you &s;peak to them with mild|ne&s;s and humanity." Chodieu, who was another of the jacobinical mi&s;&s;ionaries, tells us, that "nothing was wanting but to &s;pread in&s;truction through that coun|try, to open the eyes of the people, and unma&s;k and puni&s;h tho&s;e who mi&s;led them." And Lequinio, who had &s;o far de&s;troyed his "prejudices" and his &s;hame as to write a hi&s;tory to the convention of the ma&s;&s;acres he was about to commit near Rochelle, and of his familiar revels with the executioner, informs us that had di&s;creet and rational men been &s;ent to preach the doctrines of liberty, to de|velop
<PB N="13" REF="14">
the principles of moral and politi|cal philo&s;ophy, to invite the people to enquiry, to enlighten their minds and in|tere&s;t their feelings, that fanatici&s;m which had hitherto kept them in ignorance would have di&s;appeared, and the love of liberty would have taken place of their attachment to the deba&s;ing &s;y&s;tem under which they had lived.</P>
<P>The evidence of this man will not be &s;u&s;pected of partiality to that unhappy race, when we find him with all the fri|gid compo&s;ure of a calculator rea&s;oning hypothetically, that, if the population which remains amounted only to thirty or forty thou&s;and &s;ouls&mdash;certainly the quicke&s;t way to fini&s;h the war would be to cut their throats. "So," adds he, "I thought at fir&s;t, but the population is immen&s;e, it amounts to four hundred thou&s;and men.&mdash;If there be no hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in any other mode, without doubt we mu&s;t cut the throats of the whole,
<PB N="14" REF="15">
did they amount to five hundred thou|&s;and men; I however am far from thinking it nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;but&mdash;we mu&s;t make no pri&s;oners, and wherever we find men armed or unarmed, if there ap|pear any ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition, &s;hoot them without any farther examination!"</P>
<P>When a man, who writes philo&s;ophi|cal works to de&s;troy prejudices<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lequinio is the author of a philo&s;ophical work intitled "Prejudices De&s;troyed."</NOTE>, tells us, that the be&s;t practical mode of de|&s;troying them is to de&s;troy tho&s;e who cheri&s;h them, he in&s;tructs us only in the art of the executioner. It is melancholy to &s;ee into what mon&s;ters men may be transformed by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power, or the grovelling pa&s;&s;ion of fear. Le|quinio weighs with calmne&s;s the advan|tage or di&s;advantage of butchering five hundred thou&s;and men; and Garat and Lindet, men of temperate and philo&s;o|phical
<PB N="15" REF="16">
minds, become actors in the 31&s;t of May.</P>
<P>It is pretended that the plan of the committee was in reality that of the ge|neral extermination of the inhabitants of the Vend&eacute;e. Lequinio hints at this de|&s;ign &s;everal times, and often deliberates how far it would be advantageous in cer|tain circum&s;tances to continue the &s;y&s;tem of de&s;truction; and a writer whom I have already mentioned, Vilate, a con|fident of Barrere, Robe&s;pierre, St. Ju&s;t, and other con&s;pirators, tells us, that it was a &s;erious object of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with the&s;e great legi&s;lators, how to dimini&s;h the population of France in the &s;horte&s;t given time. Rou&s;&s;eau a&s;&s;erts, that it is the perfection of a &s;tate, when every ci|tizen has enough, and no one too much; and the provident policy of the&s;e reform|ers, it &s;eems, amounted to this conclu|&s;ion, "that as in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of pro|perty, which was but in few hands, the
<PB N="16" REF="17">
majority could be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion but of a little, and where this inequality of for|tune exi&s;ted, there could be no equality of rights, the only way of de&s;troying this inequality was to let the government &s;eize on the whole; that in order to exe|cute this plan all the great capitali&s;ts mu&s;t be &s;acrificed, that the re&s;t might be induced to yield up their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions more readily; that a certain depopulation be|came al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary, in order that France might furni&s;h from its own produce enough to feed its inhabitants; and that even after the extirpation of the people of fortune, tho&s;e incumbrances of the &s;oil, if the population &s;hould &s;till exceed the produce, means mu&s;t be found, to u&s;e Barrere's words, "to &s;weep away the rubbi&s;h," &s;o that a certain number only &s;hould remain. In the mean time the conventional arms were every where un|&s;ucce&s;sful. This ill &s;ucce&s;s was proba|bly at fir&s;t, as I have already mentioned,
<PB N="17" REF="18">
a part of the plan of the committee of public &s;afety, in order to complete the ruin of the party of the Gironde; and tho&s;e who were eye witne&s;&s;es of the events that took place furni&s;h us with addi|tional cau&s;es that fini&s;h the di&s;covery of all tho&s;e my&s;teries of which Philippeaux complains.</P>
<P>"The generals of this army," &s;ays Lequinio, a man not at all to be &s;u&s;pect|ed of affection to the cau&s;e of the royal|i&s;ts from what has ju&s;t been &s;aid, "have from the beginning made this war an object of &s;peculation and particular inte|re&s;t." Their immen&s;e pay and funds for extraordinary expences, their calcu|lations on the produce of pillage, the li|cence they gave the &s;oldiers to excu&s;e their own rapacity, increa&s;ed the love of plunder, and de&s;troyed all di&s;cipline. This habit of pillage not only introduced di&s;order into the army, but prompted to the commi&s;&s;ion of every other crime.
<PB N="18" REF="19">
"The mo&s;t &s;hocking barbarities," &s;ays Lequinio, "pre&s;ented them&s;elves at every corner. We have &s;een republican foldiers &s;hoot or &s;tab rebel women in the public roads. We have &s;een others car|rying infants torn from the brea&s;t, on the ends of their bayonets, or the pikes that had pierced with the &s;ame blow the child and the mother.</P>
<P>"All the&s;e horrors," adds Lequinio, "have &s;harpened re&s;entment, and in|crea&s;ed the number of the malcontents, who were compelled to acknowledge that our troops often di&s;played le&s;s virtue than the rebels, of whom &s;ome, it is true, com|mitted ma&s;&s;acres; but the chiefs had al|ways the policy to preach virtue, and to affect a &s;ort of indulgence and genero|&s;ity towards our pri&s;oners." His col|league Chodieu declares al&s;o, "however gro&s;s and &s;uper&s;titious our governors have been plea&s;ed to paint our brethren, we might have ea&s;ily &s;ucceeded in bring|ing
<PB N="19" REF="20">
them within the pale of liberty." The Vendeans, it is certain, &s;pared no|thing to draw over the republicans to their &s;ide, and &s;ent them back on their &s;imple parole not to bear arms again&s;t the king or religion. The convention an&s;wered this humane policy by their proclamation to rob and ma&s;&s;acre; and all who came in the way of their troops were robbed and ma&s;&s;acred.</P>
<P>Municipalities, with their civil officers in republican co&s;tume, and who were re|ceived with all the appearances of frater|nity, have been murdered the hour after. Cavaliers armed and equipped, who had travelled many miles to &s;urrender them|&s;elves, had been &s;hot without mercy. That &s;uch a conduct &s;hould increa&s;e the armies of the royali&s;ts was natural; and however well inclined a part of the in|habitants might have been to republican principles, driven to de&s;pair by the atro|cious and barbarous policy of the con|vention,
<PB N="20" REF="21">
they were compelled to take an active part with the royali&s;ts.</P>
<P>In order to exterminate the inhabi|tants of the Vend&eacute;e, it was nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;troy their abodes. Towns and vil|lages were delivered to the flames; the peopled &s;treets and the in&s;ulated cottages were doomed alike to deva&s;tation; and &s;o great was the fury of tho&s;e me&s;&s;engers of de&s;truction, which Lequinio calls "les &eacute;garements des patriotes," that they de|&s;troyed immen&s;e quantities of corn and forage, not only driving the inhabitants to the nece&s;&s;ity of increa&s;ing the royali&s;t army from want, but depriving them|&s;elves of tho&s;e re&s;ources which were ne|ce&s;&s;ary to their own exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The&s;e are not the tales of the cruel|ties of Roman emperors and tyrants in the hi&s;tory of martyrs. They are hor|rors which have pa&s;&s;ed at our very doors, and of which we daily &s;aw the witne&s;&s;es and &s;ufferers; and &s;ome of the great ac|tors
<PB N="21" REF="22">
in tho&s;e &s;cenes of ruin and de&s;ola|tion, till their crimes were expiated by their puni&s;hment after the events of the fir&s;t of Prairial, continued to live among&s;t us; they paraded our &s;treets, they &s;at in our a&s;&s;emblies, they rai&s;ed their auda|cious fronts in the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>It was not only to the &s;avage &s;oldier that the execution of this plan of exter|mination was committed: the conven|tion entru&s;ted to its own members the &s;uperintendence of this deva&s;tating &s;y&s;|tem. We have &s;een the fidelity with which it was executed by Collot d'Her|bois at Lyons. The Vend&eacute;e was not yet &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed, and Carrier was &s;ent thither&mdash;Carrier! "at the name of Carrier," &s;ays the eloquent reporter of the Robe&s;pierrian corre&s;pondence, "the &s;moking chart of the Vend&eacute;e unrolls it|&s;elf beneath our eyes. Thou&s;ands of &s;alamanders from amid&s;t the furnaces of the Vend&eacute;e feed the fire which con&s;umes
<PB N="22" REF="23">
the republic. You hear the crackling of the flame which devours both manu|factures and hamlets, cities and men; the ruins of ca&s;tles mingle with the wrecks of cottages; melancholy and deplorable equality, which exi&s;ts only in de&s;olation! I &s;ee by the glare of the blaze, tho&s;e who have kindled it, darting acro&s;s the burn|ing beams of falling hou&s;es, like birds of prey, on the trea&s;ures they contain. Even the a&s;ylum of patrioti&s;m is not re&s;pected; the enemies taken with arms in their hands, and tho&s;e who lay them down, are precipitated into the &s;ame gulph; the common foe, and the friend who leads our &s;oldiers to victory, who pro|cures them by &s;ure indications the means of nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, peri&s;h alike; and the &s;ame re&s;pect is paid to the pa|triot and the rebel."</P>
<P>If we cannot hear the name of Carrier without the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;ations of horror, will not our judgment look &s;omewhat
<PB N="23" REF="24">
further than this ferocious in&s;trument of guilt? The <HI>whole</HI> of the committee of public &s;afety were his direct accomplices, and who will ab&s;olve the convention? Carrier's in&s;tructions arrive. "We have received your letter," &s;ay the committee, "which gives us true &s;atisfaction. We conjure thee to go to Nantes immedi|ately. We &s;end thee a decree which charges thee to purge that city. It mu&s;t be emptied without delay. Liberty ne|ver trifles. We can be humane when we are conquerors." What &s;ervices Carrier had already rendered to the com|mittee, does not appear; but they found in him, no doubt, a mind &s;ufficiently ca|pacious for wickedne&s;s to &s;erve their purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Carrier arrived at Nantes the 9th of October. The prologue to the tragedy had already been delivered. Gentin, the &s;ecretary of the national commi&s;&s;ion, had already written to the intrepid moun|taineers
<PB N="24" REF="25">
forming the committee of in|&s;pection at Nantes: "Republican bre|thren, the repre&s;entatives &s;end me the inclo&s;ed pieces, which I ha&s;ten to con|vey to you. Examine, and &s;trike hard and quick, like true revolutioni&s;ts, other|wi&s;e I &s;hall not be plea&s;ed.

<P>Such are the fir&s;t in&s;tructions for Nantes. Without its walls murder had already begun its work; the peaceable inhabitants of a village near Cli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">in, with the in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry in their
<PB N="25" REF="26">
hands, were ma&s;&s;acred by Lu&s;ignan, a general of brigade, with other pea&s;ants who had been employed for &s;ome weeks in &s;upplying Nantes with provi&s;ions. In the adjoining communes, near a thou|&s;and men and women had been &s;hot without examination, and without trial; and of the&s;e ma&s;&s;acres two commi&s;&s;aries only had been the &s;uperintendants and directors. Carrier remained but a day or two at Nantes. He neverthele&s;s &s;taid long enough to open his commi&s;&s;ion, which con&s;i&s;ted in the mo&s;t atrocious in|vectives and execrations again&s;t the in|habitants, and particularly again&s;t the trade&s;men and merchants; declaring that, if he did not receive li&s;ts of charges again&s;t the latter, he would in a &s;hort time arre&s;t the whole, and then &s;hoot and guillotine one per&s;on in ten. After hav|ing made them this paternal vi&s;it, and given his in&s;tructions, he took his leave
<PB N="26" REF="27">
for a few days to go and electrify the city of Rennes.</P>
<P>It was at this period that the com|mittee of public &s;afety, through the or|gan of Barrere, publi&s;hed the happy ac|compli&s;hment of their prophetic decree, that the "Vend&eacute;e exi&s;ted no longer." At Paris, as no one dared to doubt of the infallibility of the committee, or &s;u&s;|pect its veracity, we imagined that the royali&s;ts had been completely cru&s;hed, becau&s;e the committee informed the convention that the Vend&eacute;e exi&s;ted no more. We learned, however, very &s;oon, what this annihilation of the Vend&eacute;e meant. It was not altogether one of tho&s;e agreeable figures of rhetoric with which Barrere was wont to harangue the convention, &s;ince there was &s;ome truth in the declaration, which we did not di&s;|cover at the fir&s;t glance: for the great army of the royali&s;ts had indeed evacu|ated
<PB N="27" REF="28">
the &s;eat of the war in the Vend&eacute;e, if that could be called an evacuation which was a triumphal march acro&s;s the Loire. This pa&s;&s;age was accompli&s;hed without any lo&s;s, and the royali&s;t army remained on the northern &s;ide without mole&s;tation for three days; after which they began their march towards the &s;ea coa&s;ts, acro&s;s the departments which form the ea&s;tern part of the province of Brittany.</P>
<P>It might have been expected that their pa&s;&s;age would have been oppo&s;ed, or their march hara&s;&s;ed: and that this did not happen was another of Philip|peaux's my&s;teries; but the royali&s;ts were &s;uffered to take uninterrupted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country as far as Laval, having &s;urrounded four thou&s;and men who were &s;ent in pur&s;uit of them, and whom they cut in pieces; the &s;ans-culotte general Olignier, who was ordered to march again&s;t the royali&s;ts, and protect the pa|triots,
<PB N="28" REF="29">
having thought it more prudent to keep at ten leagues di&s;tance.</P>
<P>From Laval they marched to Vitri, a place which was r&egrave;pre&s;ented as a mo&s;t advantageous and formidable pa&s;s, of which al&s;o they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as the conventional generali&s;&s;imo had effected its evacuation, though he had every means of re&s;i&s;tance, and might have &s;topped the march of the enemy, &s;ince the place was fortified, had a garri&s;on of four thou&s;and men, and was provi&s;ioned for more than a month. This place, which the inhabitants, after the departure of the garri&s;on, would have defended, if they had not been forbidden, was taken; and the royali&s;ts, after defeating &s;ome other corps which were &s;ent &s;ucce&s;&s;ively again&s;t them, marched on without fur|ther re&s;i&s;tance to the coa&s;ts through Avranches to Grandville.</P>
<P>Grandville is a &s;ea-port town on that
<PB N="29" REF="30">
part of the coa&s;t which fronts the i&s;lands of Jer&s;ey and Guern&s;ey, &s;tretching north and &s;outh, and forming a right angle with the coa&s;t that goes towards St. Ma|loes and Bre&s;t, of which the famous mountain of St. Michel is the point. It is the only port on that coa&s;t; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it would have given the royali&s;ts the advantage of immediate communication with their allies, the emi|grants and the Engli&s;h, and the means of &s;ecuring the mo&s;t effective &s;uccour.</P>
<P>As they had pa&s;&s;ed through a large tract of country with &s;o little interrup|tion, they did not expect much re&s;i&s;t|ance where the means of making it were &s;o few; and therefore concluded they could repul&s;e the garri&s;on of Grandville which had marched out to meet them, and make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of that im|portant place as ea&s;ily as they had gained the re&s;t. They took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;uburbs; but when they prepared to &s;cale
<PB N="30" REF="31">
the walls, they found a re&s;i&s;tance which they had little expected. The fir&s;t hero that fell was the mayor in the habit of his office, who had taken the command of the principal po&s;t. The royali&s;t ar|tillery made great ravages, and the hou&s;es in the &s;uburbs afforded the a&s;&s;ailants con&s;iderable &s;helter. The be&s;ieged &s;et fire to the&s;e hou&s;es, and the attack be|came &s;till more de&s;perate; the royali&s;ts were often driven down the ramparts, and the rocks that overhung the town &s;treamed with blood.</P>
<P>This battle la&s;ted near thirty hours; and I have been told by one of my ac|quaintance who fought on the republi|can &s;ide, that the &s;pectacle was truly &s;ublime. Not only every man, but every woman and every child, was that day a warrior: the artillery was &s;erved by the children, who, forming chains from the ar&s;enal to the ramparts, conveyed the ammunition, while the women were
<PB N="31" REF="32">
employed in a&s;&s;i&s;ting their hu&s;bands, brothers, and fathers, and preventing the flames of the hou&s;es in the &s;uburbs from communicating to tho&s;e in the town.</P>
<P>The royali&s;ts were at length repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s by this handful of repub|licans, and all the important advantages which they rea&s;onably expected from this expedition failed. They were forced to retreat back to the Loire, and in this retreat they might have been completely cut off: but the cowardly and deba&s;ing genius of fans-culotti&s;m again pre&s;ided; for Ro&s;&s;ignol kept at &s;even leagues di&s;tance with his army at the moment of the perilous pa&s;&s;age at Dol; and when the royali&s;ts had effected it, he brought up his troops, who were completely routed, and driven back to Rennes.</P>
<P>The royali&s;t army in their retreat laid fiege to Angers, which was defended
<PB N="32" REF="33">
bravely by the garri&s;on, and the inhabi|tants, in the ab&s;ence of Ro&s;&s;ignol. At Meaux, the royali&s;ts were defeated with great lo&s;s by We&s;terman. Having di|vided them&s;elves into two columns, they attempted to pa&s;s the Loire at Chateau|briant and Ancenis; but their good for|tune fled when the &s;ans-culotte general had cea&s;ed to command. At Ancenis they were again routed with great &s;laughter, and the pa&s;&s;age of the Loire was effected with a very con&s;iderable lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The republicans were thus delivered from an apprehen&s;ion of &s;eeing the roy|ali&s;ts at Paris, which, from the trea&s;on or ignorance of the generals, they had at one moment fully expected. While We&s;terman was pur&s;uing the advantages he had gained on the north &s;ide of the Loire, the army in the we&s;t defeated the royali&s;ts at Sallais, near Chollet; where the heroic Barra, a youth of thirteen years
<PB N="33" REF="34">
of age, was killed. The i&s;land of Noir|moutier, the key of the in&s;urgent depart|ments on the &s;ide of the &s;ea, which had &s;erved not only as a dep&ocirc;t, but al&s;o as the place of retreat for tho&s;e who, though attached to the cau&s;e of royalty, did not like to &s;hare its dangers, was at|tacked; and after a &s;evere conflict, in which the conventional troops had to contend with the waves as well as the fire of the enemy, the town was taken, and great quantities of &s;tores fell into their hands.</P>
<P>After the capture of the i&s;land, the ge|nerals and repre&s;entatives, Bourbotte and Turreau, ordered it to be &s;urrounded; and a &s;trict examination brought forth a great number of prie&s;ts and other roy|ali&s;ts, men and women, chiefly of high rank&mdash;the e&s;&s;ence, as they were called, of the catholic army, who had hid them|&s;elves in the woods and the rocks from the fury of the conventional &s;oldiers. The&s;e

unhappy fugitives were dragged to the tree of liberty, with general Delbec at their head, where in pre&s;ence of the army they were coolly murdered.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THE inhabitants of Nantes had not long to meditate on the horrors which were approaching, for Carrier returns.</P>
<P>The convention had already decreed, that every city which either gave pro|tection to the rebels, or did not repel them with all the means in its power, &s;hould be razed to the ground, and the property of its inhabitants be confi&s;cated to the pro|fit of the republic. To exterminate "the royali&s;ts of the Vend&eacute;e" it was nece&s;&s;ary to conquer them; but here the peace|able inhabitants of cities were to be de|&s;troyed, and the evidence of the crime was only to be found in the con&s;cience of the executioner. Nantes, &s;eated on the Loire, which empties it&s;elf into the &s;ea &s;ome leagues beyond it, was one of
<PB N="36" REF="37">
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and mo&s;t commer|cial cities in France. Its inhabitants were rich, and, what is not always the concomitant of riches, were di&s;tingui&s;hed for their di&s;intere&s;tne&s;s and patrioti&s;m. They had beheld with the &s;ame horror as every other friend to liberty the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the con&s;pirators of the 31&s;t of May, and the tyrants had marked their per&s;ons for vengeance, and their im|men&s;e property for pillage.</P>
<P>A revolutionary committee was fir&s;t appointed to examine into this "ari&s;to|cracy of commerce and wealth;" and this committee, as might have been expected, was compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who&s;e characters &s;tood highe&s;t, in the e&s;timation of the re|pre&s;entatives, for cruelty or wickedne&s;s. To give this committee its proper energy, a company of revolutionary &s;oldiers was formed, who were to be the &s;birri of the committee, and who&s;e occupation was &s;ufficiently marked by the name they a&s;|&s;umed,
<PB N="37" REF="38">
which was that of the company of Marat. Thus armed with the decrees of the convention, and having troops of murderers of various denominations at his command, in revolutionary com|mittees, popular &s;ocieties, admini&s;trative bodies, and Marati&s;t &s;oldiers, Carrier be|gan his operations in Nantes on the prie&s;ts who were condemned to bani&s;hment. Tho&s;e men were waiting to undergo the puni&s;hment to which the law condemned them, for ob&s;tinate per&s;everance in hone&s;t ignorance; a puni&s;hment which it is a&s;|&s;erted the circum&s;tances of the times re|quired. As the law was pronounced, it does not appear that the convention had authori&s;ed Carrier to change the &s;en|tence. This, however, he undertook; the prie&s;ts were put on board a lighter which had a &s;ous-pape, or fal&s;e bottom, and then conducted into the middle of the Loire; where, except two who e&s;|caped by &s;wimming, they were all
<PB N="38" REF="39">
drowned. Carrier wrote an account of this expedition to the convention, and, with a kind of &s;elf-complacent exulta|tion, claimed merit for the novelty and effect of the mea&s;ure.&mdash;"Quel torrent re|volutionnaire que la Loire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What a revolutionary torrent is the Loire!</NOTE>!" The con|vention applauded the idea, and ordered Carrier's di&s;patches to be in&s;erted in their gazette, the bulletin.</P>
<P>The committee of public &s;afety, though it might think the drowning of refractory prie&s;ts a plea&s;ant thing, were not perhaps aware that Carrier would take advantage of their good humour. Unfortunately for the inhabitants of Nantes, Carrier mi&s;con&s;trued their ap|probation as an invitation to proceed in his career; and having, with his &s;word drawn, at the tribune harangued the ja|cobins of Nantes on their duties, ex|plaining and enforcing the in&s;tructions
<PB N="39" REF="40">
he had him&s;elf received, in order to in|flame them with the &s;ame revolutionary zeal, he began to extend his plan of operations. The revolutionary com|mittee had determined that a great con|&s;piracy exi&s;ted in Nantes, and that the rich, who were ari&s;tocrates <HI>par privilege,</HI> were the con&s;pirators. They ordered accordingly all per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected of having been concerned in this con&s;piracy to be arre&s;ted, and to be &s;ent to Paris to be tried; decreeing, that whoever re&s;i&s;ted &s;hould be &s;hot, whoever fled &s;hould be declared an emigrant, and ordering all tho&s;e who&s;e names were publi&s;hed to &s;ur|render them&s;elves in three days; forbid|ding every one, wives, &s;i&s;ters, or daugh|ters, under &s;evere penalties, to &s;olicit their relea&s;e. Three hundred and thirty-two per&s;ons were arre&s;ted on this pretence. About one hundred of them we &s;aw brought to Paris in waggons, bound like felons, for the re&s;t had peri&s;hed from the
<PB N="40" REF="41">
exce&s;&s;ive cruelties which they had under|gone; and we were made to believe that the&s;e men, who were di&s;tingui&s;hed in Nantes for their probity and patrioti&s;m, were rebels of the Vend&eacute;e whom the re|pre&s;entative had &s;ent up to treat the Pa|ri&s;ians with a <HI>&s;pectacle,</HI> knowing their pre&s;ent ta&s;te for bloody &s;ights; and it was expected that they would have been &s;hot in the plain of Sablons, under the direction of Collot; but this never took place.</P>
<P>In the mean while Carrier &s;welled the <HI>revolutionary</HI> torrent at Nantes with other noyades, of which it appears that there were twenty-three expeditions. The&s;e noyades, or drowning &s;cenes, were at fir&s;t &s;hrouded in the darkne&s;s of night; but familiarity with crimes having worn off all &s;hame, they were afterwards exe|cuted in open day. There was al&s;o &s;ome appearance of regard for the &s;ufferings of the&s;e unhappy victims in the beginning,
<PB N="41" REF="42">
&s;ince they were left ignorant of the fate that awaited them till the moment of execution; believing that they were only going to be transferred to Belle-I&s;le, an i&s;land at the mouth of the river. There was &s;omething like mercy al&s;o in the con&s;truction of the drowning-boats, &s;ince the drawing of a bar of iron in|gulphed the victims in an in&s;tant; and Carrier, in his fir&s;t di&s;patches to the con|vention, had the mode&s;ty as well as the ingenuity of his prototype Anicetus, who, hi&s;tory &s;ays, propo&s;ed this mode to Nero, and furni&s;hed him with excu&s;es for drowning his mother<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The freedman Anicet us furni&s;hed an expedient. He propo&s;ed to con&s;truct a ve&s;&s;el, which when at &s;ea &s;hould &s;uddenly open in the middle, by which means Agrippina would in&s;tantly peri&s;h. That a number of accidents happened at &s;ea; and that if Agrippina lo&s;t her life in a &s;hipwreck, who would be &s;o malicious as to call that a crime which was the fault of the winds and waves?&mdash;See Morceaux Choi&s;is de Tacite, par M. d'Alembert.</NOTE>. But the
<PB N="42" REF="43">
crimes of the&s;e mon&s;ters being at length naturalized into manners, they grew weary of common murders, and invented new modes of de&s;truction. Other ve&s;&s;els were fitted up for the reception of pri&s;oners, which had various conveniences, among others a <HI>&s;alle &agrave; manger</HI> (a dining-room), where Carrier and his committee &s;ome|times fea&s;ted. In the&s;e ve&s;&s;els the pri|&s;oners were confined till a noyade was to take place. At one time eight hun|dred per&s;ons of both &s;exes, and of dif|ferent ages, from fifteen to four&s;core, were precipitated into the river. Where the love of life di&s;covered it&s;elf in the&s;e unfortunate victims by clinging to the barges, when in the &s;truggle their hands became untied, the murderers amu&s;ed them&s;elves with cutting them with their &s;abres, or knocking them on the head with their poles. Some of tho&s;e victims were de&s;tined to die a thou&s;and deaths; innocent young women were unclothed
<PB N="43" REF="44">
in the pre&s;ence of the mon&s;ters; and, to add a deeper horror to this infernal act of cruelty, were tied to young men, and both were cut down with &s;abres, or thrown into the river; and this kind of murder was called a republican marriage.</P>
<P>The&s;e noyades, where &s;imple drown|ing was the only &s;uffering, might be con|&s;idered as happy deliverances compared with the &s;ufferings of tho&s;e that remained in pri&s;on. The wretched pri&s;oners were heaped on each other in &s;uch numbers, that the air became ab&s;olutely pe&s;tilen|tial, and the keepers were employed con|tinually in removing the dead.</P>
<P>Delicate women, the wives and daugh|ters of tho&s;e who were made pri&s;oners in the royali&s;t army, expo&s;ed to the in|clemency of the winter in the damp of a dungeon, crowded together upon their &s;traw in order to &s;helter them&s;elves from the cold; and many a heart-breaking family &s;cene pre&s;ented it&s;elf to tho&s;e
<PB N="44" REF="45">
who&s;e humanity led them to take away the children of royali&s;ts under thirteen years of age, which the law permitted. A mother with four daughters, of which one was under fourteen, formed one of the&s;e groups. A citizen of Nantes went into the dungeon to &s;ee if there was any object on which he might exerci&s;e his charity. He took up this young girl, crawling for weakne&s;s at her mother's feet, with the intention of conveying her home; while her &s;i&s;ters, being a few years older, were doomed to peri&s;h. But to peri&s;h together now &s;eemed their only con&s;olation; they refu&s;ed to part; and &s;ome degree of violence was u&s;ed to force away the child, who &s;oon after the mur|der of her family died of a broken heart.</P>
<P>But noyades were not the only mode of murder: the fu&s;illades were introduced at Nantes as they had been practi&s;ed at Lyons. Men, women in a &s;tate of preg|nancy, boys and girls were killed with
<PB N="45" REF="46">
the bayonet, or &s;hot without di&s;crimina|tion, and without the formality of a &s;en|tence; and the executions were &s;o mul|tiplied, that the national guard were em|ployed for &s;ix weeks in burying the per|&s;ons whom they had ma&s;&s;acred. Among the multitudes de&s;tined to die, &s;ome have as it were returned to life, and given us their hi&s;tory; a few e&s;caped by &s;wim|ming; others recovered after having been &s;hot. A young married woman of rank, who was put into a fu&s;illade with her hu&s;band, although &s;he received three balls in her body, was found alive the next morning by tho&s;e who came to throw the dead into the pits. She had &s;ufficient &s;trength to implore their mercy, and they had the humanity to refer her ca&s;e to the commi&s;&s;ary. The commi&s;&s;ary at fir&s;t ordered the &s;entence to be again put into execution: but falling at his feet &s;he repre&s;ented the inju&s;tice and cruelty of making her undergo a &s;econd death,
<PB N="46" REF="47">
and that the un&s;kilfulne&s;s or negligence of the executioners ought not to &s;ubject her again to puni&s;hment. The commi&s;|&s;ary was &s;oftened, and con&s;ented that her life &s;hould be &s;pared, provided &s;he wouldb ecome a &s;ick nur&s;e in the ho&s;|pitals, where the per&s;on who related the anecdote to me &s;aw her employed.</P>
<P>Some &s;light forms were ob&s;erved in the execution of the decrees of the con|vention in the beginning of the&s;e ma&s;|&s;acres, and the ferocity of Carrier was &s;ometimes checked by the repre&s;enta|tions of the con&s;tituted authorities, and &s;ometimes arre&s;ted by the oppo&s;ition of the judges. Carrier had named two wretches to the office of head execution|ers, who had <HI>general</HI> orders for drowning whenever they had lei&s;ure. The public accu&s;er, who, though a timid old man, had oppo&s;ed a &s;econd general noyade which the&s;e ruffians were about to make, was &s;ent for by Carrier, who &s;aid to him,
<PB N="47" REF="48">
"It is you then, you old wretch, who take upon you to oppo&s;e my orders! Take notice, that if the pri&s;ons be not emptied in two hours, I will guillotine you and the whole commi&s;&s;ion." The poor old man was affrighted, fell &s;ick in&s;tantly, and died imprecating cur&s;es on Carrier.</P>
<P>After this le&s;&s;on to the judges, no one thought of re&s;i&s;ting Carrier's revolution|ary impul&s;e. The royali&s;ts who were made pri&s;oners, and tho&s;e who laid down their arms, came into Nantes and met with the &s;ame fate. Pregnant women, who were under the protection of a &s;pe|cial decree, were murdered, and more than &s;ix hundred children, formally ex|cepted by the law as being under the age of fifteen, were drowned, notwith&s;tanding the ob&s;ervation hazarded by the pre&s;i|dent of the tribunal, who was an&s;wered by the mon&s;ter, "All, all without ex|ception;
<PB N="48" REF="49">
there can be no difficulty in the ca&s;e."</P>
<P>Even the&s;e are but &s;light offences com|pared to certain atrocities that are al|leged again&s;t him; the tyrants of an|tiquity are "quite &s;horn of their beams;" Caligula, Nero, and all that antient hi&s;|tory records of &s;trange murders, is ob|&s;cured in our remembrance by the cruelty of Carrier. Former tyrants and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins when compared to him appear but <HI>mo|der&eacute;s</HI>; and Caligula's famous exclama|tion re&s;pecting the people of Rome is lo&s;t in the affliction of Carrier, when he regretted to his colleague Laingelot, who pa&s;&s;ed through Nantes in his way to Bre&s;t, the limits by which he was con|fined in the execution of national ju&s;tice, having only the Loire for the extent of his operations: "Oh, what a happy fel|low will you be," he adds, "happier far than I am! You will have the <HI>&s;ea</HI> for your
<PB N="49" REF="50">
expeditions, and a fleet of <HI>&s;hips</HI> at your command!"</P>
<P>This revolutionary, or rather counter-revolutionary, impul&s;e was not confined to Nantes. The country around was &s;ub|jected to the &s;ame horrors. Whole com|munes were extirpated; and the peace|able inhabitants of different places, whom the murderers had a&s;&s;embled together, and who had never taken arms or given encouragement to the rebels, were ma&s;|&s;acred without di&s;tinction; women and children, magi&s;trates dre&s;&s;ed in their &s;carfs, going out to meet and welcome the conventional troops; thou&s;ands of citizens under arre&s;t, in&s;urgents who had &s;urrendered them&s;elves, pea&s;ants work|ing in the fields, all fell alike the victims of this de&s;olating fury.</P>
<P>The &s;cent of blood was become &s;o in|&s;tinctive with tho&s;e revolutionary mi&s;|&s;ionaries in the Vend&eacute;e, that though none of them could rai&s;e them&s;elves to
<PB N="50" REF="51">
Carrier's &s;ublimity of wickedne&s;s, there were many who, according to his own declaration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"Vous voyez," dit Carrier, "que cette d&eacute;cla|ration ne s'applique pas &agrave; moi, mais &agrave; tous les repr&eacute;|&s;entans du peuple dans la Vend&eacute;e."</P>
<P>"You &s;ee," &s;ays Carrier, "that this declaration is applicable not to me, but to all the repre&s;entatives of the people in the Vend&eacute;e."</P></NOTE>, practi&s;ed very &s;ucce&s;sfully as <HI>amateurs.</HI></P>
<P>Of the various calamities inflicted on this unhappy country, my imagination, melancholy as it is, could never furni&s;h me with images &s;trong enough to paint the horror, nor can any beneficial effect be produced on the mind by dwelling on evils &s;o terrible; &s;ince I believe that the heart grows hard, that the feelings become deadened, by the long contem|plation of &s;o wide a wa&s;te of ruin.

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE committee of public &s;afety, having &s;ecured its permanence in the dictator&s;hip through the complai&s;ance of the convention, which with loud and lively applau&s;es renewed its powers, for the &s;ake of form, at the end of each month as they expired, grew bolder in its pro|jects, and, not &s;atisfied with revolution|izing the republic after their own manner, a&s;&s;erted that their neighbours ought al&s;o to be made happy by ta&s;ting the <HI>&s;weets</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>ine&s;timable</HI> liberty. It had ge|nerally been under&s;tood, that the pre&s;ent war was the war only of the Engli&s;h mi|ni&s;ter; and that the people of England, though well wi&s;hers to the cau&s;e of freedom, were not &s;ufficiently powerful to coun|teract the de&s;igns of the admini&s;tration.
<PB N="53" REF="54">
As long as this opinion of the apathy of the Engli&s;h prevailed, we had lived in tolerable &s;ecurity; for it was difficult to per&s;uade the French, notwith&s;tanding the experience they had of the late war, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> free people would twice wa&s;te its trea|&s;ure and its &s;trength, in &s;o &s;hort a period, again&s;t nations &s;truggling into freedom. The trea&s;on of Toulon, however, awak|ened the French from their dream of the <HI>bonhommie</HI> of the Briti&s;h nation towards them; and nothing was now talked of but the cowardly and ferocious Engli&s;h, and marching to Carthage.</P>
<P>In this language more was meant than was obvious to a common ob&s;erver; for it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the committee of government to work up the people to a &s;trong degree of national hatred, in or|der to carry into effect a plan of inva&s;ion which they were meditating, although its impracticability had been demon&s;trated by tho&s;e with whom they advi&s;ed, and who
<PB N="54" REF="55">
were more conver&s;ant on the &s;ubject than them&s;elves; and at length they received the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t &s;atisfactory evidence that the Engli&s;h were not at all inclined to make the experiment to which they were invited. In the mean time the crimes of the Engli&s;h government were the &s;tand|ing order of the day at the jacobins; and had it not been for the &s;pur given to malignity by the&s;e declamatory ha|rangues, nothing could have been more amu&s;ing than their &s;tyle.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of the&s;e performers in politics was the tragedian of Lyons. "We are now entering," &s;ays Collot, "into the con&s;cience of Pitt, into that volcano which vomits forth every crime. We have traver&s;ed this mortiferous and pe&s;tilential lava; let us now march up to the crater, I mean the Engli&s;h government. If this government was not inherently bad, Pitt could not have found the means
<PB N="55" REF="56">
of being &s;o abominable. I would not put this government into competition with that of France. This would be comparing the exce&s;s of every vice, with the a&s;&s;emblage of every virtue; a government," adds this orator, ju&s;t returned from Lyons reeking with the blood of thou&s;ands of innocent vic|tims, "&s;uch as Heaven ought to have given to all nature; while the other is vicious, wanting all the virtues which we e&s;teem, and filled with every thing that is held in abhorrence among&s;t us."</P>
<P>Although Robe&s;pierre had for certain rea&s;ons thrown off his pack, the jacobins, in pur&s;uit of the crimes of the Engli&s;h government, he did not permit any of them without cha&s;ti&s;ement to follow too clo&s;e. One orator propo&s;ed &s;ending in|&s;tantly a hundred cannon to e&s;tabli&s;h liberty on the banks of the Thames; and, as a preparatory &s;tep, to put to death all
<PB N="56" REF="57">
the remains of the Bri&s;&s;otine faction, and all the <HI>toads of the mar&s;h</HI> who were endea|vouring to creep up the <HI>mountain.</HI> Such were the denominations of the &s;eventy-three impri&s;oned deputies, and tho&s;e of the republicans who &s;till remained in the convention. As Robe&s;pierre had not been con&s;ulted, there was an audacity in the propo&s;ition which provoked his warme&s;t indignation. He admitted that the propo&s;ition was extraordinarily po|pular, and revolutionary to the twentieth degree; but, as a puni&s;hment for its ra&s;hne&s;s, he condemned the &s;peaker to an exclu&s;ion from the &s;ociety; as well as another member who took up his de|fence, and talked of the de&s;poti&s;m of opinion. Robe&s;pierre immediately mark|ed him on the &s;pot with the &s;eal of re|probation, by declaring, as a proof of the culprit's criminality, that, when a jury|man of the revolutionary tribunal, he had
<PB N="57" REF="58">
given his verdict in favour of Miranda, who was known to be the great and firm &s;upport of the Bri&s;&s;otine faction.</P>
<P>The jacobins were a&s;toni&s;hed that &s;o well-informed a nation as the Engli&s;h &s;hould be reduced to &s;o pitiable a con|dition as that of being ruled by mon|&s;ters and volcanos; and this wonder grew till Robe&s;pierre, who had hitherto kept &s;ilence except when a member be|came ultra-revolutionary, told them they were all in the wrong. "It is to no purpo&s;e," &s;ays he, "to talk to the En|gli&s;h about their government, or attempt to make them better; for you are all very much deceived if you think that either the morals or under&s;tanding of the Engli&s;h nation are at all to be compared with the French. They are two hun|dred years behind you, and hate you with a very con&s;tant and perfect hatred. If therefore you wi&s;h to inform them, you mu&s;t accommodate your&s;elves to
<PB N="58" REF="59">
their incapacity, and adapt your lan|guage to their comprehen&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It appears that Voltaire was of a different opi|nion from Robe&s;pierre. "The Italians," &s;ays he, "till the time of Muratori, have never been think|ers; the French have thought only by halves; but the Engli&s;h, becau&s;e their wings have never been clipt, have flown to heaven and become the precep|tors of the world, &amp;c."</P>
<P>Had Voltaire lived at this period, and e&s;caped the guillotine, he would perhaps have applied to Robe&s;|pierre the ob&s;ervation he made on Marat, who had ju&s;t then written a great book in order to demoli&s;h the Newtonian philo&s;ophy, and make a revolution in all &s;ciences, particularly the &s;cience of anatomy; "that he was more fitted to calumniate mankind, than to analy&s;e them."</P>
<P>It is not in the heat of revolutions that the true characters of their actors can be appreciated, and perhaps calumny never &s;ported with reputations more &s;trangely than during the political conflicts which have happened in France. <HI>Robe&s;pierre</HI> and <HI>patrioti&s;m</HI> have been &s;ynonymous terms; Marat lo&s;t his own name in that of <HI>the friend of the people</HI>; and the new term for robbery and pilfering was <HI>bri&s;&s;ot-er.</HI> Of the extent of Robe&s;pierre's patrioti&s;m the evi|dence has been written in the blood of the innume|rable victims of his tyranny. Marat is now con&s;i|dered as a mi&s;chievous madman; but his character has never been well analy&s;ed, except in a &s;ketch which Bri&s;&s;ot has drawn of him in a work written during his la&s;t captivity, which I have read in ma|nu&s;cript, and from which I &s;hall tran&s;cribe the por|trait of Marat. See Appendix, No. II. I take this opportunity of mentioning that this po&s;thumous work of Bri&s;&s;ot, which will &s;oon be publi&s;hed for the benefit of his amiable widow and her children, is written with the mo&s;t affecting &s;implicity, candour, and truth. It is the hi&s;tory of an hone&s;t man, who was devoted to liberty from his earlie&s;t years, and who&s;e life was one continued &s;truggle in its cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It appears from this work, that Bri&s;&s;ot had been from his youth a republican in his political principles, and a &s;ceptic in religion. He was one of the &s;ubverters of the French monarchy; but with the &s;ame firmne&s;s with which he had rejected the millions offered to him by the court, he refu&s;ed to participate in the crimes which &s;tained the republic, and preferred being their victim. His &s;ceptical er|rors in religion he &s;hared in common with all men of letters in France; who univer&s;ally con&s;ider infi|delity as in&s;eparably connected with philo&s;ophy, and who&s;e ignorance in matters of religion is only equal|led by their arrogance in rejecting what they have not examined. Bri&s;&s;ot's Memoirs are replete with anecdotes of celebrated characters, both in France and England: they are written in the manner of Rou&s;&s;eau's Confe&s;&s;ions: the writer develops him&s;elf to the world, and takes the &s;ame liberty with his acquaintance.</P>
<P>The French republic has already rein&s;tated the memory of Bri&s;&s;ot. Already his name is pronoun|ced with reverence, as one of the founders of that republic, as the benefactor and the martyr of his country.</P></NOTE>."</P>
<P>Robe&s;pierre put an end to this jaco|binical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, &s;o kindly meant for the information of their unhappy neighbours,
<PB N="59" REF="60">
upon &s;eeing new dangers pre&s;&s;ing round him which it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to make the order of the day. He had
<PB N="60" REF="61">
arrived to &s;uch a point of de&s;poti&s;m in the &s;ociety, that tho&s;e who had any cou|rage were di&s;po&s;ed to revolt, and tho&s;e who were cowards were in a con&s;tant
<PB N="61" REF="62">
&s;tate of terror. He had fa&s;hioned the &s;ociety to his own purpo&s;es by an <HI>epura|tion,</HI> in which all tho&s;e who were not deemed to have opinions conformable to his own, or energy &s;ufficient to execute great de&s;igns, were excluded. But it was not without murmur that he was &s;uffered to bear his faculties &s;o imperiou&s;ly: there were &s;ome who looked back to their high e&s;tate with &s;hame, that &s;o contemp|tible a tyrant &s;hould have outrun their popularity.</P>
<P>Among the follies of the day were the reports of Barrere; who, as he was pro|fe&s;&s;edly the lacquey of the tyrants, was appointed to be their trumpeter at the tribune. His reports were &s;o extravagant, and &s;o full of fal&s;ehood, that they at length became proverbial; and when we meant to expre&s;s our di&s;approbation of any thing at once &s;illy and atrocious, we were accu&s;tomed to ob&s;erve that it was a

"For a free people to have peace," &s;ays he, "the only way is to exterminate all de&s;pots. The French republic can only &s;ecure peace by dictating that peace to the world; then it will be la&s;ting. Let us take a view of the forces in array again&s;t us&mdash;Look at them&mdash;there are the Engli&s;h&mdash;the Iri&s;h&mdash;the Scotch&mdash;the Hanoverians" (He might have added the Shetlanders, and the people of the I&s;le of Man)&mdash;"Au&s;trians, Bohemians, Hungarians, Flemi&s;h"&mdash;(He might have enumerated the people of the Black Fore&s;t, and the prince of Fur&s;tenburg)&mdash;"Neapolitans, Piedmonte&s;e, Italians, and Papi&s;ts, &amp;c." In this mode of enumerating, Barrere might have counted enemies

and a plain man, who had no great &s;kill in tho&s;e matters, would have fallen into the &s;ame error as the ho&s;t, who being called up on a dark night by a Spani&s;h traveller, and informed that don John-Jerome-Franci&s;co-Pedro, with a mul|titude of other chri&s;tian names, &s;ur|names, and titles, was arrived, an&s;wered from his chamber-window, that they mu&s;t go on to the town at a few miles di&s;tance, for that he had not room for a twentieth part of the company.</P>
<P>The commune of Paris, who had hi|therto met with no oppo&s;ition to the va|riety of reformation which they had pro|po&s;ed, who had co-operated in the over|throw of government on the 31&s;t of May, and who had &s;ince, of their own autho|rity, annihilated the religion of the country, conceived that they might with equal facility take the regulation of both church and &s;tate into their own hands, and di&s;burthen the convention of the

weight. They thought that tho&s;e who had contributed to gain the victory ought to &s;hare in the &s;poils; they beheld with unea&s;ine&s;s the growing influence of their accomplices in the convention, and re|&s;olved not to &s;uffer the continuance of this u&s;urpation without remon&s;trance. The ambitious members of the com|mune were not &s;upported upon this oc|ca&s;ion by their allies the jacobins; for Peyreira, Proly, and Defieux, who had hitherto influenced that club, had now objects in view more gratifying to their feelings than di&s;putes about the divi&s;ion of &s;upreme power, &s;ince they had gain|ed a &s;ufficient portion to enable them to conduct the operations of that &s;hare of the government which they had taken under their more immediate protection, which was the regulation of the finances.</P>
<P>Robe&s;pierre, who&s;e aim was permanent authority, did not &s;uffer the depredations of his jacobin agents to pa&s;s unnoticed.
<PB N="65" REF="66">
He found that the &s;tability of his govern|ment would be endangered if &s;uch en|croachments on his admini&s;tration were &s;uffered to continue; and accordingly took a revolutionary mea&s;ure, and put them into pri&s;on as dilapidators of the public fortune. Among the&s;e dilapida|tors were the mo&s;t active per&s;ecutors of the fallen party of the Gironde. The chiefs of the municipality, who had hi|therto been the agents of Robe&s;pierre, were alarmed at the impri&s;onment of their co-adjutors, the chiefs of the jaco|bins; and did not well brook returning to their primitive in&s;ignificancy, and leaving their accomplices in tranquil po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the power they had helped them to u&s;urp. The fir&s;t &s;ymptom of rebellion was the denunciation which Hebert made again&s;t Barrere at the ja|cobins'. It was not &s;ufficient to lull the nation into de&s;poti&s;m by promi&s;ing it the free&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible con&s;titutions;
<PB N="66" REF="67">
the conque&s;t of all the kingdoms of the world, and kings brought in fetters to Paris, were al&s;o promi&s;ed with as much facility to the good people of the repub|lic, as the knight of La Mancha di&s;po&s;ed of governments and i&s;lands to his tru&s;ty &s;quire. Among other &s;plendid a&s;&s;ur|ances, Barrere had proclaimed from the tribune, that the war in the Vend&eacute;e &s;hould be fini&s;hed on the 1&s;t of Novem|ber. To &s;ave his credit, the prophet appeared at the tribune at the ap|pointed time; and becau&s;e the royal|i&s;ts were marching victoriou&s;ly from the Vend&eacute;e acro&s;s the country, to the northern coa&s;ts, he confidently a&s;&s;ured the convention that the Vend&eacute;e exi&s;ted no longer. Hebert's a&s;&s;ertion was well founded, that at the moment when Bar|rere pronounced their de&s;truction they were in greater force than ever; but as to doubt the reports, the infallibility, or the rea&s;oning of the committee of pub|lic &s;afety was an act of trea&s;on again&s;t
<PB N="67" REF="68">
the republic, this crime of Hebert was not forgotten. The commune of Paris perceived that the committee of public &s;afety had obtained an ab&s;olute power over the convention, and took mea&s;ures to provide again&s;t it, by adverti&s;ing a &s;y&s;tem directly oppo&s;ite to that of the committee, which they judged would be more acceptable to the people, and e&s;ta|bli&s;h their own popularity. They, who had been the contrivers of every in&s;ur|rection; who had prompted to every mur|der, and had demanded at the bar of the convention that <HI>terror</HI> &s;hould continue to be the order of the day; that all prie&s;ts whatever &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from all functions civil and <HI>military</HI>; that the pri&s;oners of the Temple, the children of the late king, &s;hould be &s;ent to the common pri&s;ons on the ground of equality, and that all per&s;ons who had gone to their country hou&s;es &s;hould be ordered, on pain of being &s;u&s;|pected,
<PB N="68" REF="69">
to come into town, in order pro|bably to be ma&s;&s;acred more conveniently; became at once mild and tender-hearted. "There exi&s;ts," &s;ays Chaumette<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chaumette was at the beginning of the revolu|tion a &s;hop-boy, and afterwards a hackney-writer. Hebert was a candle-&s;nuffer at one of the theatres; and afterwards a receiver of the entrance money; from which place he was driven for his di&s;hone&s;ty.</NOTE>, the procureur of the commune, "a con&s;pi|racy to divide patriots. <HI>We</HI> and the mountain-members of the convention have been from the beginning of the re|volution the firme&s;t &s;upports of liberty, and it is al&s;o again&s;t us that calumny di|rects its principal efforts.

unju&s;tly torn from him; the hu&s;band that of his wife, and the brother that of his brother. Let us teach tyrants that man is the citizen of his country, and not the &s;lave of de&s;poti&s;m." The procureur in con&s;equence demanded that ten mem|bers of each revolutionary committee &s;hould be called to the general council, to labour conjointly with the committee of public &s;afety, and that two members only &s;hould remain in each committee to watch over the execution of the mea|&s;ures to be taken. The &s;en&s;ibility of the committee of public &s;afety was le&s;s awakened than that of the commune by Chaumette's pathetic eloquence. One of the members talked of Brutus and his &s;ons, and another remarked on the dan|ger of rival powers, and invited the convention to annul the decree of the commune. The convention, finding one tyranny &s;ufficiently burden&s;ome, imme|diately obeyed; and the commune, like
<PB N="70" REF="71">
the re&s;t of the republic, &s;ubmitted to the yoke.</P>
<P>The commune was not the only rival with which Robe&s;pierre had to contend; for though a feeling of common danger had produced between men who were di&s;cordant in every thing but wicked|ne&s;s, an alliance&mdash;when that danger was pa&s;t, there was no tie remaining by which they might continue to be united. It is the puni&s;hment of tyrants and villains to live in continual terror of each other; and this was the fate of tho&s;e who had con|&s;pired to overturn the republic, and who had de&s;troyed tho&s;e virtuous friends of liberty by whom it was founded. Robe&s;|pierre feared, that the &s;ame means which he, with the aid of the commune of Pa|ris, had employed again&s;t the Gironde, might be again put in practice to over|throw him&s;elf; and as he &s;aw that the commune a&s;pired to independence, and had already given &s;igns of an ambitious
<PB N="71" REF="72">
&s;pirit, he dreaded le&s;t &s;ome rival might &s;tart up, who, with more genero&s;ity and larger promi&s;es, might pu&s;h him from his &s;eat. This rival he &s;aw in the per|&s;on of Danton, who, with greater talents than Robe&s;pierre, and with a mind &s;omewhat le&s;s atrocious, had from natu|ral indolence neglected to cultivate that &s;ort of popularity which would &s;oon have rai&s;ed him to be the chief of this cabal. Of this party were Camille De&s;moulins, the author of the libel again&s;t the Gi|ronde, which was publi&s;hed at the time as an addre&s;s from Paris to the depart|ments; Fabre d'Eglantine, who was an intriguer, with more addre&s;s and le&s;s ho|ne&s;ty than Camille; La Croix, who was a wretch covered with crimes&mdash;venal, ba&s;e, and treacherous; a compound of the mo&s;t &s;hocking vices; who had been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively paid by the court and the foreign powers, and who&s;e &s;ervices were at the di&s;po&s;al of tho&s;e who could be&s;t
<PB N="72" REF="73">
reward them. There were others of le&s;s note, &s;uch as Philippeaux, who had been a mountaineer of the lower region, and who, though &s;haring in the iniquity of his party, had been le&s;s active than the re&s;t in the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes. He had incurred the &s;u&s;picion of hone&s;ty from the account he publi&s;hed of the iniquity of the war in the we&s;tern de|partments; but he &s;trongly contended for his &s;hare in the general villany, as the friend of Marat, and the murderer of the Gironde. The&s;e men had only hinted di&s;approbation at the exce&s;s of the tyranny which was then exerci&s;ed. But Robe&s;pierre collected the whi&s;pers of the party before any plan was actually arranged, and declared loudly, though my&s;teriou&s;ly, both in the convention and the jacobins', that the republic was in danger from the combinations of &s;edi|tious and perver&s;e men; whom he re|pre&s;ented as new men, patriots of ye&s;ter|day,
<PB N="73" REF="74">
who were eager to lay hold of the pillars of the revolution, and, by climbing to the height of the moun|tain, precipitate tho&s;e who had hitherto &s;at there with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s. The height of the mountain, was another figure for the &s;ummit of his kingdom, where many of tho&s;e whom he was about to accu&s;e had long a&s;pired to the loftie&s;t &s;eats, which it was impo&s;&s;ible all could obtain;
<Q><L>Devil with devil damned</L>

but here, as the &s;upremacy was to be un|divided, no two parties could exi&s;t on equal terms at the &s;ame time. The par|ty of Danton had lo&s;t much of its influ|ence with the people by the indolence of the chief, and the rapacity of the &s;ubal|terns; while Robe&s;pierre had neglected no means to obtain that dominion on which he had per&s;everingly bent his
<PB N="74" REF="75">
mind. Under Robe&s;pierre's banners the great majority of the committee had enli&s;ted; but his &s;worn and &s;acred allies were St. Ju&s;t and Couthon, who&s;e &s;ouls were of adamantine temper. Barrere had not yet taken all his degrees in atro|city, being only their lacquey, and hav|ing nothing very original in wickedne&s;s, except the phra&s;eology he made u&s;e of in its ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>Robe&s;pierre now thought that it was nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;afety to be di&s;encum|bered of the faction of the commune, and the faction of Danton. It was not difficult to bring a thou&s;and charges again&s;t them, of which one alone before the great tribunal of national ju&s;tice would have been &s;ufficient to have directed the &s;word of national vengeance; but as the accu&s;ers could proffer none of tho&s;e charges without criminating them&s;elves, they had recour&s;e to the expedient of their being accomplices of the faction

The convention, therefore, was in&s;tructed by St. Ju&s;t, that a con&s;piracy was framed by foreigners, who were about to commit a number of horrible things, &s;tarve, plunder, and murder the good people of the republic; that this faction had already overthrown religion and morality, and was about to form a new &s;ect of immorality, and the love of &s;en&s;ual enjoyments, from which innocence and virtue had every thing to dread; that the great directors of the&s;e machi|nations

criminals &s;hould be confined in pri&s;on till the peace, when they were to be bani&s;hed for ever; the convention decreed, that &s;ix popular commi&s;&s;ions &s;hould be form|ed to try tho&s;e per&s;ons &s;peedily, and &s;horten the labour of the revolutionary tribunal. Other decrees of the &s;ame co|lour pa&s;&s;ed at this period, &s;uch as mak|ing the per&s;on who &s;hould conceal a con|&s;pirator liable to the &s;ame puni&s;hment.

<P>Had the vengeance or jealou&s;y of the tyrants been directed only again&s;t their own accomplices; had only their a&s;&s;o|ciates in wickedne&s;s, their Heberts and their Dantons fallen, though the accu|&s;ations on which their condemnation was founded were ab&s;urd and ground|le&s;s, there was no one who would not have rejoiced at tho&s;e &s;teps towards na|tional

deliverance. But the&s;e acts of ju&s;tice were very rare, while tho&s;e of murder were increa&s;ing every day. Among the ma&s;s of victims which at this period were &s;acrificed were the farmers|general of France. The&s;e men had never been favourites with the people at any period; their profe&s;&s;ion was in it&s;elf un|popular, though I have never heard that any of the per&s;ons who &s;uffered had been guilty of any acts of oppre&s;&s;ion not al|lowed by the law. The&s;e men were ac|cu&s;ed of various crimes, but none wore a more heinous appearance than a plot which, it was a&s;&s;erted, they had formed again&s;t the health of the citizens in pre|paring and vending bad &s;nuff. There was little hope that, when the guillotine was the mini&s;ter of finance, farmers-ge|neral could e&s;cape: all were guilty of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing riches; all therefore peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>The municipality of Sedan was led to death <HI>en ma&s;s,</HI> at the &s;ame period. They
<PB N="79" REF="80">
were accu&s;ed of being partizans of La Fayette at the epocha of the 10th of Au|gu&s;t. Ignorant of the events which had been pa&s;&s;ing in Paris, and under mili|tary con&s;traint, they had for a few days &s;upported La Fayette's preten&s;ions; but they &s;oon di&s;covered their error, and ac|cepted the amne&s;ty that was offered them. No new cau&s;e of impeachment could be brought again&s;t them except their great wealth, on account of which they were &s;ent to the tribunal at Paris; where forty of them were condemned to die. Sedan was famous for its manufactories, and the&s;e men were the proprietors of the chief e&s;tabli&s;hments. Their wealth, while it circulated throughout Europe, fur|ni&s;hed food to thou&s;ands who were now reduced to want, and their own hitherto opulent families were devoted to beg|gary and ruin.</P>
<P>The tyranny of the&s;e mon&s;ters was not the only evil with which the people of
<PB N="80" REF="81">
France had to &s;truggle. Famine was pre&s;&s;ing on with ha&s;ty &s;trides. The law of the maximum had not only driven away the foreign merchant, but al&s;o kept at a di&s;tance the dealer, who was accu&s;|tomed to provide for the daily returning wants of the inhabitants. The grazier no longer drove his oxen to Paris, where the maximum, on entering the barriers, dimini&s;hed half their value; nor could the butcher furni&s;h meat, when the maxi|mum allowed him but half the purcha&s;e money of the cattle. Des caremes ci|viques<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Patriotic Lents.</NOTE>, and other revolutionary mea|&s;ures of the like &s;ort, were recommended to the fa&s;ting multitude; but one wag, more indignant than the re&s;t, painted well the &s;tate of want and cruelty to which Paris was then abandoned, by writing on the pede&s;tal of the &s;tatue which was placed on the &s;pot of the pub|lic

<P>This melancholy period was the full completion of that prophetic moment when Vergniaud poured out his eloquent &s;oul again&s;t tho&s;e murderers, in his fa|mous &s;peech on the trial of Lewis XVI. "And ye, indu&s;trious citizens, who have made the revolution; ye, who&s;e &s;acri|fices are multiplied every day in propor|tion to the wants of your country; what will become of you? What will be your re&s;ources? What hands will wipe away your tears? Who will give comfort to your families? Will you go and &s;eek for your pretended friends? Ah, rather fly from them! I will tell you what they will an&s;wer, when you &s;hall a&s;k them for bread. They will &s;ay, "Go to the charnel-hou&s;es, and tear from the earth the palpitating limbs of the corp&s;es which
<PB N="82" REF="83">
we have there heaped together." Blood and corp&s;es&mdash;the&s;e are all they will have to offer you! "You &s;hudder, my fel|low citizens; O! my country, I call thee to witne&s;s the efforts which I make to &s;natch thee from the horrible cri&s;is into which the&s;e men would plunge thee!" But his prophetic &s;pirit failed, when he a&s;&s;ured his auditors that tho&s;e days of mourning would never arrive. "Tho&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins are too cowardly," &s;ays he; "tho&s;e little Mariuses, grovelling in the mud of the mar&s;h, where fled that con|&s;pirator, who had at lea&s;t &s;ome virtues." Vergniaud was mi&s;taken: the modern chiefs had indeed le&s;s courage than Ma|rius, but the citizens of Paris were more cowardly than the citizens of Rome.</P>

<L>And nature wears a veil of deadly hue.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t acts of Maignet, upon his arrival in the department of Vau|clu&s;e, was the de&s;truction of the village of Bedouin, &s;ituated in a country of the mo&s;t romantic beauty, and where the benign climate fo&s;ters all the rich productions of &s;ummer, and forms a &s;triking contra&s;t to the eternal &s;nows which cover the mountain of Ventoux, at the foot of which the village is placed.</P>
<P>A &s;mall tree of liberty which had
<PB N="87" REF="88">
been planted on a &s;olitary &s;pot near Bedouin, was, during the night, torn from the ground by &s;ome wretches who knew that this incident would furni&s;h a pretext for pillage and deva&s;tation. At break of day the very per&s;ons who were the perpetrators of this act, one of whom was the pre&s;ident of the popular &s;ociety, &s;ounded a general alarm, and accu&s;ed the guiltle&s;s inhabitants of Bedouin of the &s;acrilege committed again&s;t the hal|lowed &s;ymbol of freedom.</P>
<P>Revolutionary troops were in&s;tantly &s;ummoned to carry fire and &s;word through the village and territory of Be|douin. A municipal commi&s;&s;ion was im|mediately organized by Maignet, which pre&s;ented it&s;elf wherever there was the hope of &s;poil, &s;preading every where de&s;olation and death. Five hundred habitations were delivered to the flames; the fruits of the harve&s;t were con&s;umed, and the mandate of Maignet, fatal as the
<PB N="88" REF="89">
fabled wand of an evil magician, &s;truck the rich and luxuriant &s;oil with &s;udden &s;terility. The flouri&s;hing manufactures of Bedouin &s;hared the fate of its de&s;ola|ted fields; and all that was &s;aved from the general wreck were the trea&s;ures &s;pread by the fruitful &s;ilk worm upon the tops of the trees by which it is nouri&s;hed. A tribunal of blood was formed by the order of Maignet; every day the de|&s;tined number of victims were marked by the public accu&s;er; and the inhabi|tants, who were unable to name the guilty per&s;ons, were all involved in one pro&s;cription. Tho&s;e who e&s;caped the knife of the guillotine &s;ought for &s;helter in the depths of caverns, after the conflagration of their habitations, on the ruins of which placards were fixed, forbidding any per&s;on to approach the &s;pot.

Bedouin who had flown to the frontier even before the requi&s;ition in order to de|fend their country, in vain di&s;patch &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive letters, enquiring with fond &s;oli|citude after their parents. Tho&s;e gal|lant young &s;oldiers will return to their native village, their brows bound with the laurels of valour. Alas! they will find their native village but one &s;ad heap of ruins!&mdash;in vain they will call upon the tender names of father, of mother, of &s;i&s;ter:&mdash;a melancholy voice will &s;eem to i&s;&s;ue from the earth that covers them, and &s;igh, <HI>they are no more!</HI> For tho&s;e victorious warriors no car of triumph is prepared; no mother's tears of tran&s;port &s;hall hail the ble&s;&s;ed mo|ment of their return; no father &s;hall cla&s;p them to his bo&s;om with exulting joy, proud of their heroic deeds. Ah, no! their toils, their dangers, and their generous &s;acrifices &s;hall find no recom|pen&s;e in the &s;weetne&s;s of dome&s;tic af|fection,

<P>The village of Bedouin was too con|fined a &s;phere for the de&s;troying genius of Maignet. His thir&s;t of blood was not yet allayed, his ta&s;te for de&s;olation was not yet gratified. A wider &s;cene of ruin fired his imagination, and his crea|tive genius furni&s;hed the committee of public &s;afety with a model for the law of the 22d of Prairial, which bani&s;hed all judicial forms from the revolutionary tribunal of Paris. Maignet, after the de&s;truction of Bedouin, cau&s;ed what he termed a popular commi&s;&s;ion to be erect|ed at Orange, for the purpo&s;e of trying all the counter-revolutioni&s;ts of the de|partments of Vauclu&s;e, and the mouth of the Rhone, without any written evi|dence,
<PB N="91" REF="92">
and without a jury. "Twelve or fifteen thou&s;and per&s;ons are impri&s;oned in tho&s;e departments," &s;ays Maignet, in a letter to Couthon; "if I were to exe|cute the decree which orders all con&s;pi|rators to be brought to Paris, it would require an army to conduct them, and they mu&s;t be billeted like &s;oldiers upon the road." Maignet therefore obtained the &s;anction of the committee of public &s;afety, which was given without the con&s;ent of the convention, to his plan of forming a popular commi&s;&s;ion at Orange.</P>
<P>The committee of public &s;afety named the judges, who by their conduct ju&s;tified the di&s;cernment with which they were cho&s;en, and proceeded with revo|lutionary rapidity in their work of death. "You know," &s;ays the &s;ecretary of the commi&s;&s;ion, in a letter to Payan, "the &s;ituation of Orange; the guillotine is placed in the front of the <HI>mountain,</HI> and it &s;eems as if the heads in falling paid it
<PB N="92" REF="93">
the homage it de&s;erves." Sometimes however the majority of the judges of Orange complain in their letters of two of their colleagues, who&s;e con&s;ciences had not altogether attained the height of the revolution. Faurety, the pre&s;ident of the commi&s;&s;ion, &s;ays in a letter to Payan, "Ragot, Feruex and my&s;elf are <HI>au pas</HI>;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The military expre&s;&s;ion of marching <HI>au pas,</HI> to the beat of the drum, became a &s;ort of cant term much in u&s;e during the tyranny of Robe&s;pierre; and adherence to the principles and doctrines of the day was &s;ignified by &s;aying je &s;uis <HI>au pas.</HI></NOTE> Roman Fouvo&s;a is a good creature, but an adherer to forms, and a little off the revolutionary point which he ought to touch. Meillerit, my fourth colleague, is good for nothing, ab&s;olutely good for nothing in the place he occupies; he is &s;ometimes di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ave counter-revo|lutionary prie&s;ts; he mu&s;t have <HI>proofs,</HI> as at the ordinary tribunals of the antient &s;y&s;|tem."&mdash;Tho&s;e trouble&s;ome &s;cruples of
<PB N="93" REF="94">
two of the judges were however &s;o com|pletely over-ruled by the majority of their colleagues, that the departments of Vau|clu&s;e and the mouth of the Rhone be|came the &s;cenes of the mo&s;t horrible out|rages again&s;t humanity. Multitudes had already peri&s;hed by the murderous com|mi&s;&s;ion of Orange, and multitudes in the gloom of pri&s;ons awaited the &s;ame fate, when the fall of Robe&s;pierre &s;topped the torrent of human blood.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the ma&s;s of far-&s;pread evil, amid&s;t the groans of general calamity, no doubt many a &s;igh of private &s;orrow has never reached the ear of &s;ympathy, and many a victim has fallen unpitied and unknown.

Petrarch, the tender, the immortal Petrarch, had trod tho&s;e very valleys, had climbed tho&s;e very rocks, had wandered in tho&s;e very woods&mdash;and the two young per&s;ons, who both under&s;tood Italian, when they read together the melodious &s;trains of that di|vine poet, found them&s;elves tran&s;ported into new regions, and forgot for a while that revolutionary government exi&s;ted.

<P>Young de M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> con&s;idered the de|fence of his country as a &s;acred duty which he was bound to fulfil. He in&s;tant|ly prepared to depart. He bid adieu to his father and Adelaide with tears wrung from a bleeding heart, and tore him|&s;elf away with an effort which it required the exertion of all his fortitude to &s;u&s;|tain. After having pa&s;&s;ed the cleft which enclo&s;ed the valley, he again turned back to gaze once more on the &s;pot which contained all his trea&s;ure. Adelaide, after his departure, had no con&s;olation but in the &s;ad yet dear indulgence of tender recollections; in &s;hedding tears over the paths they had trod, over the books they had read together. Alas, this unfortu|nate young lady had far other pangs to &s;uffer than the tender repinings of ab|&s;ence from a beloved object! Some weeks

after the departure of her lover, the departments of Vauclu&s;e and the Mouth of the Rhone were de&s;olated by Maig|net.

this terrible calamity, which filled up the mea&s;ure of her afflictions, her rea&s;on entirely for&s;ook her.

Some of the &s;oldiers propo&s;ed conducting her al&s;o to the tribunal; but the leader of the band, whether touched by her di&s;tre&s;s, or fearful that her de&s;pair would be trouble&s;ome on the way, per&s;uaded them to leave her behind. She was dragged from her uncle, and locked in a chamber, from whence her &s;hrieks were heard by the unfortunate old man till he had pa&s;&s;ed the narrow cleft of the valley, which he was de&s;tined to behold no more. His &s;ufferings were acute, but they were not of long duration. The day of his arrival at Orange, he was led before the popular commi&s;&s;ion, together

She was con&s;tantly followed in her ramblings by her faithful &s;ervant, who never lo&s;t &s;ight of her a &s;ingle moment, and who re|tains in her memory many a mournful complaint of her di&s;ordered mind, many a wild expre&s;&s;ion of de&s;pair. She often retired to a &s;mall nook near the torrent, where her uncle had placed a &s;eat, and where he u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours of the day. Sometimes &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf on the bench; then &s;tarted up, and, throwing her&s;elf on her knees before the &s;pot where her uncle u&s;ed to &s;it,
<PB N="106" REF="107">
bathed it with floods of tears. "Dear old man," &s;he would cry, "your aged head!&mdash;They might have left me a lock of his grey hairs.

<P>The acute affliction with which young de M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> heard of the murder of his father was &s;till aggravated by the tidings he received from Marianne of the &s;ituation of his beloved Adelaide. Her image was for ever pre&s;ent to his mind; and, unable to &s;upport the bitter|ne&s;s of tho&s;e pangs which her idea ex|cited, he again found means to obtain leave of ab&s;ence for a few weeks, and ha&s;tened to the valley. He found the habitation de&s;erted&mdash;all was dark and
<PB N="107" REF="108">
&s;ilent: he flew through the apartments, calling upon the name of Adelaide, but no voice an&s;wered his call.</P>
<P>He left the hou&s;e, and walked with ha&s;ty &s;teps along the valley. As he pa&s;&s;ed a cavern of the rocks, he heard the moans of Adelaide&mdash;he ru&s;hed into the cavern&mdash;&s;he was &s;eated upon its flinty floor, and Marianne was &s;itting near.&mdash;Adelaide ca&s;t up her eyes as he entered, and looked at him earne&s;tly&mdash;he knelt by her &s;ide, and pre&s;&s;ed her hand to his bo&s;om&mdash;"I don't know you," &s;aid Ade|laide.&mdash;"Not know me!" he cried, "not know Charles!"&mdash;"If you <HI>are</HI> Charles," &s;he re&s;umed &s;ullenly, "you're come too late&mdash;'tis all over!&mdash;Poor old man!" &s;he cried, ri&s;ing ha&s;tily from the ground, and cla&s;ping her hands together, "don't you &s;ee his blood on my clothes?

<P>Such were the ravings of the di&s;order|ed imagination of this unfortunate young lady, and which were &s;ometimes inter|rupted by long intervals of &s;ilence, and &s;ometimes by an agony of tears. Her lover watched over her with the mo&s;t tender and unwearied a&s;&s;iduity; but his cares were ineffectual. The life of Ade|laide was near its clo&s;e. The convul|&s;ive pangs of her mind, the extraordi|nary fatigues &s;he had &s;uffered in her wan|derings, the want of any nouri&s;hment except bread and water, &s;ince &s;he ob&s;ti|nately refu&s;ed all other food, had re|duced her frame to a &s;tate of incurable weakne&s;s and decay.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time before &s;he expired, &s;he recovered her rea&s;on, and employed her la&s;t remains of &s;trength in the attempt to con&s;ole her wretched lover. She &s;poke

to him of a happier world, where they &s;hould meet again, and where tyrants &s;hould oppre&s;s no more&mdash;&s;he gra&s;ped his hand&mdash;&s;he fixed her eyes on his&mdash;and died.</P>
<P>With the gloomy &s;ilence of de&s;pair, with feelings that were denied the relief of tears, and were beyond the utterance of complaint, this unfortunate young man prepared with his own hands the grave of her he loved, and him&s;elf covered her corp&s;e with earth.</P>
<P>The la&s;t offices paid by religion to the dead, the hallowed taper, the lifted cro&s;s, the &s;olemn requiem, had long &s;ince vani&s;hed, and the municipal officer re|turned the du&s;t to du&s;t with unceremo|nious &s;peed.

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<P>AT the fearful climax of revolutionary government which we have now reach|ed, we find no &s;oothing objects which can repo&s;e the weary eye, or cheer the &s;inking heart. An hi&s;torical &s;ketch of this period is no common picture of hu|man nature, tinctured with the blended hues of vice and virtue: it is like the &s;a|vage &s;cenery of Salvator, where all is wildly horrible, and every figure on the canva&s;s is a murderer. We are forced to wander through &s;ucce&s;&s;ive evils; to turn our eyes from the popular commi&s;|&s;ion of Orange to the revolutionary tri|bunal of Arras, from the crimes of Maig|net to the atrocities of Lebon.</P>
<P>This revolutionary chief took his place in the national convention as the &s;econd
<PB N="113" REF="114">
&s;uppl&eacute;ant of the department of Calais, a few weeks after the memorable 31&s;t of May. It appears that the committee of public &s;afety had penetration enough to di&s;cern his extraordinary capacity for evil, &s;ince he had appeared a very &s;hort time at the convention, when he was &s;ent upon mi&s;&s;ion, with full plenitude of revo|lutionary powers, into the department of the Pas du Calais, of which he was a repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>Lebon &s;eems to have determined to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf, and merit the ap|plau&s;e of his employers, by exerci&s;ing new modes of oppre&s;&s;ion, and trying new experiments of cruelty. One of his pre|liminary &s;trokes of tyranny was that of dragging in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion the multitude he had arre&s;ted, from their re&s;pective pri|&s;ons, and obliging them to appear be|fore the popular &s;ociety, placed on an elevated &s;eat, where the men were ex|po&s;ed to all the indignities his agents
<PB N="114" REF="115">
could inflict, and the women to the coar&s;e&s;t ribaldry and the mo&s;t barbarous in&s;ults. The&s;e examinations were the u&s;ual prelude to an accu&s;ation before the revolutionary tribunal which he e&s;tabli&s;h|ed at Arras, and a &s;ection of which he &s;ent, for the &s;ake of expedition in his work of death, to Cambray. The judges and jury of tho&s;e tribunals were compo&s;|ed of his own relations and his creatures; and, together with the executioner, they lived in his hou&s;e, and dined at his table.</P>
<P>In the mean time he cau&s;ed the fol|lowing in&s;cription to be written over the door of his apartment: "Ceux qui en|treront ici pour &s;oliciter l'&eacute;largi&s;&s;ement des pri&s;onniers, n'en &s;ortiront que pour &ecirc;tre mis en arre&s;tation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e who enter here to &s;olicit the relea&s;e of pri&s;oners, &s;hall only go out to be them&s;elves put in confinement.</NOTE>." Thus did this unrelenting tyrant &s;eek to repre&s;s the ge|nerous
<PB N="115" REF="116">
efforts of friend&s;hip, and congeal the tears of &s;ympathy by the &s;en&s;e of per|&s;onal danger.</P>
<P>The large and populous city of Arras &s;oon wore the a&s;pect of an unpeopled de|&s;ert. No cheerful &s;ounds were heard in the &s;treets: all was &s;olitary and &s;ilent. The town appeared widowed of its in|habitants; the few who remained at li|berty having found them&s;elves, when they ventured to go out, expo&s;ed "to meet the rudene&s;s and &s;willed in&s;olence" of Lebon and his inebriated jury, who paraded the &s;treets armed with &s;abres and pi&s;tols, in&s;ulting, and often arre&s;ting, per&s;ons with who&s;e countenance or figure they happened to be di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The mountain-leaders had all a con|genial thir&s;t for blood; but while others contented them&s;elves with i&s;&s;uing man|dates for its being &s;hed, Lebon was un|&s;atisfied unle&s;s he beheld it flow. At the hour of execution he u&s;ed to appear
<PB N="116" REF="117">
at a balcony of the theatre, near which the &s;caffold was placed, and &s;ip his cof|fee while the heads of his victims were falling. Sometimes he ordered the mi|litary bands to play revolutionary airs during the executions. Sometimes he apo&s;trophized the per&s;ons who were about to die; and the la&s;t &s;ounds which met their ear were the outrages again&s;t humanity which i&s;&s;ued from his polluted lips.</P>
<P>The former marquis de Vieux-fort was tied to the fatal plank, with the knife &s;u&s;pended over his head, when Lebon appeared upon the balcony of the theatre, commanded the executioner to &s;top, and obliged the unfortunate &s;ufferer to re|main in that &s;ituation while he read to the people a new&s;paper he had ju&s;t re|ceived, and which contained the account of a recent victory. He then, addre&s;&s;|ing him&s;elf to mon&s;ieur de Vieux-fort, told him to carry to the other world his
<PB N="117" REF="118">
de&s;pair at the&s;e tidings of &s;ucce&s;s, and at length ordered him to die.</P>
<P>Among the multitudes who were &s;a|crificed to the barbarous caprices of Le|bon, &s;ome were put to death upon pre|tences &s;o trivial, that nothing can perhaps furni&s;h a &s;tronger proof of the ab&s;olute, the unblu&s;hing tyranny he exerci&s;ed, than the daring effrontery with which he in&s;ulted the under&s;tanding as well as the feelings of the people, in the motives he alleged for inflicting the puni&s;hment of death.</P>
<P>The former marquis of Viefville, an old and gallant officer, had retired to end his days in privacy at a &s;olitary &s;pot call|ed Steenmonde, in the department of the North. To this retreat he was accom|panied by his daughter, an only child, who watched over the infirmities of his advanced age with unwearied tender|ne&s;s, and who&s;e filial piety &s;hed a ray of happine&s;s on tho&s;e years which have no
<PB N="118" REF="119">
plea&s;ure in them. This venerable old man and his amiable daughter were the objects of general re&s;pect and e&s;teem. But virtue, which was a tacit reproach to the mon&s;ters who then deva&s;tated this unfortunate country, was as offen&s;ive to them as the light of day to the &s;ullen bird of darkne&s;s. It happened that this family had for twelve years pa&s;t been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a parrot, whom different per&s;ons had taught its mimic le&s;&s;ons. The e&s;tate of the marquis was &s;ituated on the limits of the German empire; part of his grounds belonged to that territory, and the parrot had been in|&s;tructed to cry "Vive l'empereur!" and al&s;o to call the "petit Louis," the name of a young child who lived in the hou&s;e. The agents of Lebon received intelli|gence, that tho&s;e forbidden words had been uttered by the parrot; the bird was denounced, &s;eized as a criminal of importance, and depo&s;ited in the hou&s;e
<PB N="119" REF="120">
of a revolutionary commi&s;&s;ary, where the feathered culprit repeated the guilty &s;ounds. The tidings &s;pread through the city, of the arre&s;t of an audacious coun|ter-revolutionary parrot, who boldly cried "Vive le roi!" and who, it was a&s;&s;ert|ed, had even carried his effrontery to &s;uch a length as to exclaim, "Vivent les pr&ecirc;tres! Vivent les nobles!" So far we may &s;mile at the ab&s;urdities of our tyrants; but that di&s;po&s;ition is con|verted into feelings of indignant horror, when we learn that an act of accu&s;ation was immediately i&s;&s;ued again&s;t M. Vief|ville, his daughter, and her waiting-wo|man, who were dragged from their retire|ment, and led before the revolutionary tribunal.</P>
<P>The jury unanimou&s;ly declared that tho&s;e per&s;ons were convicted of being the authors or accomplices of a con&s;pi|racy again&s;t liberty and the French peo|ple; and of unlawful re&s;i&s;tance to revo|lutionary
<PB N="120" REF="121">
and republican government; having a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly taught a parrot to ut|ter the dete&s;table phra&s;e of "Vive le roi! vive l'empereur! vivent nos pr&ecirc;|tres! et vivent les nobles!" and, by &s;o doing, having provoked the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of royalty and of tyranny; for which rea&s;ons they were condemned to die.</P>
<P>The old man &s;ummoned all his for|titude, and went to the &s;caffold with the calmne&s;s of innocence; often lifting up his head, which was bowed down with age, to gaze upon his admirable daugh|ter, who met death with the &s;ame cou|rage, and who &s;eemed to forget her own &s;ituation in that of her beloved parent.</P>
<P>Such are the crimes which cannot but excite horror in tho&s;e who have lived at a di&s;tance from their &s;anguinary influ|ence, but the reflection on which, to tho&s;e who have been witne&s;&s;es of their enormity, renders exi&s;tence hateful.&mdash;<PB N="121" REF="122">
Such are the mon&s;ters into which men are transformed by unlimited power; whether arrayed in imperial purple, and &s;urrounded by pretorian guards; or wearing for a diadem a <HI>jacobin cap,</HI> and followed by an executioner and a <HI>revo|lutionary</HI> jury.</P>
<P>A pea&s;ant of d'Achicourt, a village near Arras, came to &s;ell her butter in the town. As &s;he walked along a &s;treet, &s;he met a cart filled with victims who were going to execution.&mdash;"Voil&agrave;," &s;aid this poor creature with na&iuml;vet&eacute;, "voil&agrave; des gens qui meurent pour bien peu de cho&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e people there die for very little.</NOTE>!" She was in&s;tantly &s;eized, and led to the tribunal of Lebon. During her trial &s;he held in her arms her infant of three months old, whom &s;he &s;uckled. When &s;he heard her &s;entence of death, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">What! for that one word I &s;aid, will you part the child and its mother?</NOTE>"Quoi!" &s;aid &s;he, "quoi, pour un mot
<PB N="122" REF="123">
que j'ai dit, vous allez &s;&eacute;parer l'enfant d'avec la mere!" When &s;he received the fatal &s;troke, the &s;treams of maternal nouri&s;hment i&s;&s;ued rapidly from her bo|&s;om, and, mingled with her blood, bathed her executioner.</P>
<P>Among the numerous victims of Le|bon, none excited more general &s;ympathy than the family of mon&s;ieur de Mayoul, a former noble, who lived at Arras with his wife, his two daughters, and an infant &s;on. Mon&s;ieur de Mayoul was altogether confined to his hou&s;e by the gout; and his daughters, two elegant and accom|pli&s;hed young women, who both touched the piano-forte with admirable &s;kill, en|deavoured to make the talents they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ub&s;ervient to the amu&s;ement of their infirm parent, and e&s;tabli&s;hed con|certs at their hou&s;e every week; when he was &s;oothed with the plea&s;ures of mu&s;ic. Sometimes they &s;ought to vary his amu&s;e|ments
<PB N="123" REF="124">
by dancing in his pre&s;ence with their companions; and the motive of filial piety which animated the diver&s;ions of tho&s;e amiable young women, excited in the &s;pectators a &s;entiment like that of Sterne, when, at the pea&s;ant's cottage, he fancied he &s;aw "Religion mingling in the dance."</P>
<P>Two of mon&s;ieur de Mayoul's &s;ons had emigrated; but the family continued to live undi&s;turbed, and un&s;u&s;pected of having had any previous knowledge of that circum&s;tance. It happened that ge|neral Cu&s;tine, in pa&s;&s;ing through Arras, had &s;hewn &s;ome civilities to madame de Mayoul and her daughters. When Cu&s;|tine had peri&s;hed, and when Lebon ar|rived at Arras, this circum&s;tance was im|puted to the family of Mayoul as a crime. It was a&s;&s;erted that they were notorious ari&s;tocrates, and al&s;o that the young ladies had danced and &s;ung the very day when the news arrived of the defeat of one of
<PB N="124" REF="125">
the republican armies. Upon this pre|text, madame de Mayoul, her two daughters, and a female &s;ervant were arre&s;ted, and thrown into pri&s;on. They were accu&s;ed of being the authors, or ac|complices, of a con&s;piracy framed again&s;t the liberty of the French people, of being the enemies of revolutionary government, of having held a&s;&s;emblies at their hou&s;e in order to rejoice at the &s;ucce&s;s of the armies of the tyrants, and of having ap|proved of the emigration of the two young Mayouls.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e accu&s;ations they were or|dered to appear before the revolutionary tribunal; but notwith&s;tanding the num|ber of judicial a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations which took place at that period, the young ladies, with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s not merely of in|nocence, but of the motives of filial duty which had con&s;ecrated their amu&s;ements, fondly believed they had nothing to fear.
<PB N="125" REF="126">
But madame de Mayoul was well aware of their danger.</P>
<P>The night preceding their appearance at the tribunal, after having been rigor|ou&s;ly &s;earched by the jailors, they were not, as was u&s;ual, thrown into a dungeon, but were allowed the indulgence of pa&s;&s;|ing the night in the &s;ociety of their fel|low pri&s;oners. One of tho&s;e pri&s;oners relates, that madame de Mayoul, ad|dre&s;&s;ing her children, &s;aid to them, "You know, my dear, my tender friends! you know that my fir&s;t care in your educa|tion has been to excite in your minds &s;uch &s;entiments as might &s;ecure you the e&s;teem of others, and the happine&s;s of &s;elf-ap|probation."&mdash;"Ah yes," interrupted her daughters, "we have only been taught virtue by your precepts and your exam|ple." "I may die then," re&s;umed ma|dame de Mayoul, "with the &s;atisfaction of thinking that I have never given you any improper coun&s;el, and that my fel|low
<PB N="126" REF="127">
citizens will believe I am altogether incapable of having led you to rejoice at the misfortunes of your country in the lo&s;s of a battle." "Never, never!" they exclaimed, "you and we are alike incapable of &s;uch conduct&mdash;we call upon the world to witne&s;s our innocence&mdash;it is impo&s;&s;ible we can fail to ju&s;tify our&s;elves from &s;uch an inculpation&mdash;and we &s;hall be re&s;tored to liberty." "Ah, my chil|dren," re&s;umed madame de Mayoul, "in&s;tead of indulging that &s;oothing hope, this is the moment to &s;ummon all your fortitude, and prepare for the wor&s;t&mdash;for re&s;igning&mdash;" "Is it po&s;&s;ible," they cried, "that a calumny &s;o ab&s;urd, &s;o atrocious, can expo&s;e us to the pangs of &s;eeing our mother peri&s;h?&mdash;We think not of our|&s;elves&mdash;how could we wi&s;h to &s;urvive you?" and throwing them&s;elves upon their mother's neck, they bathed her with their tears.</P>
<P>Madame de Mayoul then told them, that
<PB N="127" REF="128">
the only hope &s;he had left, was, that &s;he alone &s;hould peri&s;h, and that they would not be involved in the &s;ame pro&s;cription.&mdash;"But if," &s;he continued, "they &s;hould carry their barbarity to that exce&s;s, with|out con&s;ideration for your youth, and for the authority which I may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have over your minds; if you mu&s;t indeed &s;hare my fate&mdash;then, my dear children, my beloved friends, arm your|&s;elves with my fortitude;&mdash;place all your confidence, as I do mine, in eternal ju&s;|tice.

<P>In &s;uch conver&s;ation this unfortunate

family pa&s;&s;ed the night&mdash;their la&s;t night! The next morning they were led to the tribunal, and from thence to the &s;caffold. They died with the &s;erenity of virtue, and with the hope of immortality.</P>
<P>The unfortunate mon&s;ieur de Mayoul, bereaved of all that endeared exi&s;tence, is bending with &s;orrow to the grave.

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the execution of the faction of Danton and that of the commune had taken place, both of which had been con|demned on the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and ill-founded accu&s;ations, as I have already related, the decemvirs found no longer any oppo&s;i|tion to their tyranny, but &s;aw the lives and fortunes of the people of France laid abjectly at their feet. But in&s;tead of employing their power to any u&s;eful pur|po&s;e, or even to that of giving &s;tability to their own government by favouring the weak after having overthrown the mighty; they became more profu&s;e in the wa&s;te of blood, and atrocious without motive or end. Whether the tyrants &s;u&s;pected the fidelity of their tribunal,
<PB N="130" REF="131">
or whether they thought that the bu&s;ine&s;s of death was not readily enough di&s;|patched, tho&s;e &s;ix commi&s;&s;ions which I have before mentioned were al&s;o put into activity. The pri&s;oners in general rejoiced at this in&s;titution; for they had the credulity to think that the evidence of civi&s;m which &s;ome could exhibit, and the exemption from any po&s;itive counter|revolutionary charge which others could prove, would obtain their releafe by the&s;e commi&s;&s;ions, without undergoing the for|mality of a hearing before the tribunal; and as the&s;e commi&s;&s;ions were not in|ve&s;ted with the power of life and death, every one was anxious to gain an audi|ence. The admini&s;trators of police, and the revolutionary committees, were or|dered to procure printed lists, which in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive columns di&s;played the paren|tage, birth, and education, principles, conduct, and connections of every pri|&s;oner under their re&s;pective care, toge|ther
<PB N="131" REF="132">
with the motives of their arre&s;t, and the opinions entertained of them by their accu&s;ers. Each pri&s;oner was to undergo a &s;ort of political interrogatory before the commi&s;&s;ion; and as mo&s;t of them had been long confined, and &s;o many contradictory principles and &s;tand|ards of patrioti&s;m had &s;ucceeded each other &s;ince their captivity began <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> pri|&s;oner mu&s;t have had more than common &s;agacity to have an&s;wered his catechi&s;t agreeably to the fa&s;hion of the day. For, had be declared his belief in the divinity of rea&s;on, and a&s;&s;erted that prie&s;ts were impo&s;tors, he would have been imme|diately condemned as a <HI>Chaumetti&s;t:</HI> or, had he profe&s;&s;ed his patriotic faith in a black wig, dirty &s;hirt, and pantaloons, he would have been &s;entenced as a con|&s;pirator of the <HI>Hebert faction.</HI> Indeed, to the great majority of pri&s;oners, which con&s;i&s;ted of people of former rank, this Babyloni&s;h language was unknown in al|mo&s;t
<PB N="132" REF="133">
all its dialect; and their interro|gatory was altogether u&s;ele&s;s, their fate being previou&s;ly decided. A friend of mine &s;aw one day in the hands of a re|volutionary commi&s;&s;ary, one of tho&s;e blank li&s;ts which he was going to fill up. "We have," &s;ays he, "in our <HI>pigeon-hou&s;e,</HI>" meaning the mai&s;on d'arr&ecirc;t of his &s;ection, "about one hundred and twelve old birds and young; of the&s;e, about twenty or thirty we &s;hall &s;end to the <HI>little window,</HI> and the re&s;t &s;hall &s;et out on their <HI>travels.</HI>" Such were the cant terms for death and bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>The operations of the popular com|mi&s;&s;ions were altogether unknown till af|ter the 10th of Thermidor, when their papers and li&s;ts of &s;entences were found among the manu&s;cripts of the tyrants. Some per&s;ons, on whom only &s;entence of deportation had been pa&s;&s;ed by the com|mi&s;&s;ion, were afterwards condemned by the committee of public &s;afety to death:
<PB N="133" REF="134">
&s;uch was the Male&s;&s;i family, the father, mother, and two daughters, who&s;e &s;tory I have related. Their crime was &s;tated in the papers of the commi&s;&s;ion, and they were &s;entenced to be bani&s;hed for being "exce&s;&s;ively fanatical, and connected with prie&s;ts; which connection <HI>might</HI> pro|pagate the &s;pirit of counter-revolution." Some were condemned for being enemies of the revolution, others for being of the ca&s;t of nobility; &s;ome for what they had done, others for what they had not done; "n'ayant jamais rien fait pour la revolution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Having never done any thing for the revolution.</NOTE>." One gentleman whom I knew, was doomed to bani&s;hment for having a&s;ked with &s;ome impatience, a &s;econd time, for his certificate at the &s;ection&mdash;"redemandant une &s;econde fois avec de menaces<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A&s;king for it a &s;econd time with menaces.</NOTE>." The two
<PB N="134" REF="135">
young St. Chamands, beautiful girls of fifteen and nineteen years of age, ex|nobles, were condemned to deportation for <HI>their oppo&s;ition to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil and religious liberty</HI>; "beaucoup prononc&eacute;es en fanati&s;me, et contre la libert&eacute;, <HI>quoique tr&egrave;s jeunes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strong fanatics, and enemies to liberty, although &s;o young.</NOTE>." And al&s;o the family of Sourdeville, con&s;i&s;ting of a mother and two daughters, who&s;e only crime, as &s;tated by the judges, was, that madame Sourdeville was "the mother of an emigrant, an ex-noble, and ari&s;|tocrate, having her hu&s;band and another &s;on &s;truck by the &s;word of the law;" and the two young ladies were likewi&s;e con|demned with her, for &s;tanding in the rela|tion of &s;i&s;ter and daughter to the unfortu|nate father and brother who had peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Robe&s;pierrian faction having thus &s;eized on all the admini&s;trative powers,
<PB N="135" REF="136">
which they di&s;pen&s;ed with their own hands; having cru&s;hed the chiefs of the other factions, and terrified their ad|herents into the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;ilence, had arrived at the &s;ummit of their am|bition; at a point where a few months before the mo&s;t extravagant imagination would &s;carcely have placed them, and believed that their power was &s;ettled on a ba&s;is which could never be &s;haken. The departments al&s;o being now under the influence of the &s;ame terror as the city of Paris; the great in&s;trument of its in&s;truction and di&s;cipline, the revolution|ary army, was broken as u&s;ele&s;s and cumber&s;ome. The chief of this army, Ron&s;in, who had been one of the con|ductors of the war in the Vend&eacute;e under the title of general mini&s;ter, or mini&s;ter general, had peri&s;hed in what was called in the dialect of the time the Hebert <HI>batch</HI>; accu&s;ed of alienating the affec|tions of his troops from the committee
<PB N="136" REF="137">
of public &s;afety; which was probably true, &s;ince there was another faction in great vigour at that moment, which was the war faction, or the party of Bouchotte, and his &s;ecretaries Vincent and others, who peri&s;hed at the &s;ame time as Hebert; this faction being not a little dangerous to the de&s;poti&s;m of the augu&s;t decem|virate. The revolutionary army, which was now broken, had fulfilled its mi&s;&s;ion agreeably to its in&s;titution and in&s;truc|tions, though it does not appear that the numerous and wanton acts of cruelty which it committed were either ap|proved or &s;anctioned by the convention; on the contrary, &s;ome very &s;evere ani|madver&s;ions were there made upon its conduct, and &s;ome &s;trong accu&s;ations were brought again&s;t it, which were con|firmed by the mo&s;t authentic evidence.</P>
<P>The execution of the Danton faction, and the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of this army, were fol|lowed by other mea&s;ures equally revo|lutionary,
<PB N="137" REF="138">
in which we were our&s;elves included; for it was at this period, the beginning of April, that the law took place which bani&s;hed nobles and foreign|ers from Paris, and which ordered all &s;u&s;pected of con&s;piracy to be &s;ent from all parts of the republic to be tried at Paris. As it was &s;aid of Greece, that you could not move a &s;tep without treading on a hi&s;tory, &s;o it might now have been &s;aid of Paris, that you could not pa&s;s along a &s;treet without viewing &s;ome ob|ject of horror. Our bani&s;hment there|fore, had it not been attended with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of what was pa&s;&s;ing in the &s;cene we had left, would have been bli&s;s, compared to our re&s;idence in town.</P>
<P>Nothing perhaps contributed to mi&s;|lead the people of Europe &s;o much, with re&s;pect to the &s;tate of the French nation at this period, as the intelligence which was conveyed to them by the public papers. It required a more intimate
<PB N="138" REF="139">
knowledge of French affairs than foreign|ers in general could find the means of obtaining, to reconcile the intelligence given in tho&s;e new&s;papers with the atro|cities which they heard were committed. While pillage and murder, under the name of confi&s;cation and puni&s;hment, blackened every part of the republic; the papers pre&s;ented us with the mo&s;t elegant and philo&s;ophical reports on agriculture, literature, and the fine arts. But for the long catalogue of victims which clo&s;ed the evening paper, we might, even in our retreat at Marly, have fancied that the reign of philo&s;ophy had begun, and that, where there was ap|parently &s;o earne&s;t a de&s;ire to civilize and &s;uccour mankind, there could not be &s;o mon&s;trous an a&s;&s;emblage of trea&s;on, atrocity, and carnage.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e intere&s;ting and in&s;truc|tive reports, which tended to &s;often the hideou&s;ne&s;s of the general outline, were
<PB N="139" REF="140">
made by men who had not the means or the courage to &s;tem the torrent, who &s;ighed in &s;ecret over its ravages, and em|ployed their moments in doing &s;ome|thing which might tend to re&s;cue their country from the barbari&s;m into which it was ha&s;tening. I particularly allude to the reports of Gregoire on the im|provement of the language, on the pub|lic libraries, and on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of national gardens throughout the republic.</P>
<P>Sometimes the decemvirs them&s;elves relaxed from their habitual ferocity, and a report e&s;caped from their lips, in which there was neither con&s;piracy nor murder. Barrere, in a momentary caprice of virtue, pronounced a di&s;cour&s;e on the means of rooting out mendicity from the republic, replete with humanity and ideas of general benevolence.</P>
<P>Barrere, however, &s;oon made the <HI>amende honorable</HI> to the &s;y&s;tem he had abandoned for a moment, by delivering
<PB N="140" REF="141">
immediately after his famous decree, "to make no Engli&s;h or Hanoverian pri&s;on|ers," calling on the army, who happily for Gallic honour refu&s;ed to hear him, "When victory &s;hall put the Engli&s;h in your power, &s;trike; let no one return to the land of Great Britain, nor one remain on the free &s;oil of France." It is not ge|nerally known, that the reward held out to him for this act of boldne&s;s was, that although he had been a Feuillant, a Girondi&s;t, and of all parties in their turn; he was, immediately upon this report, thought worthy by Robe&s;pierre to be ad|mitted into the &s;anctum &s;anctorum of the patriots, and was enrolled a <HI>jacobin.</HI></P>
<P>The chief him&s;elf, who affected to &s;tand aloof, and never to mingle per&s;on|ally in the wars of the le&s;&s;er factions, but re&s;erved him&s;elf for high exploits, having acknowledged the exi&s;tence of the &s;upreme being in the overthrow of the commune and the Dantoni&s;ts, con|de&s;cended
<PB N="141" REF="142">
to give the convention a long lecture on theology in his report on na|tional fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned Voltaire's ob&s;ervation, that athei&s;m might prove a greater &s;courge to mankind than &s;an|guinary &s;uper&s;tition; but probably a greater &s;courge than either is powerful hypocri&s;y. We can guard our rea&s;on again&s;t &s;ophi&s;try or violence, but from the tribute which hypocri&s;y pays to vir|tue, of wearing her &s;emblance, we are more ea&s;ily deceived. It was probably on account of the great danger of this vice to &s;ociety, that the &s;aviour of man|kind, while he looked on failings with indulgence, and on crimes with pardon, poured forth all the anathema of indig|nation and vengeance again&s;t hypocri&s;y. The trembling criminal whom the law condemned to death, &s;aw mercy beam|ing in his eye, and the weeping peni|tent found reconciliation at his feet,
<PB N="142" REF="143">
while he placed an eternal line of demar|cation between the hypocritical Sanhe|drim and the Almighty.</P>
<P>While Robe&s;pierre behind the &s;cenes was i&s;&s;uing daily mandates for murder, we &s;ee him on the &s;tage the herald of mercy and of peace&mdash;we &s;ee him af|fecting to pour the balm of con&s;olation into the wounds which he was him&s;elf inflicting; and, like the unrelenting inqui&s;itor, recommending to mercy the wretch whom he was delivering to tor|ture. "Con&s;ult," &s;ays this fini&s;hed actor, "only the good of the country, and the intere&s;ts of mankind. Every in&s;titution, every doctrine which con&s;oles and ele|vates the mind, &s;hould be cheri&s;hed; re|ject all tho&s;e which tend to degrade and corrupt it. Re-animate, exalt every generous &s;entiment, every &s;ublime moral idea, which your enemies have &s;ough to obliterate; draw together by the charm of friend&s;hip, and the ties of
<PB N="143" REF="144">
virtue, tho&s;e men whom they have at|tempted to &s;eparate. Who gave thee a mi&s;&s;ion to proclaim to the people that the Divinity exi&s;ts not? Oh thou, who art enamoured of this &s;terile doctrine, but who never wa&s;t enamoured of thy country! what advantage do&s;t thou find in per&s;uading mankind that a blind fatality pre&s;ides over their de&s;tiny, &s;trik|ing guilt and virtue as chance directs; and that the human &s;oul is but a fleeting breath, extingui&s;hed at the gates of the tomb?</P>
<P>"Will man be in&s;pired with more pure and elevated &s;entiments by the idea of annihilation, than by that of immorta|lity? Will it produce more re&s;pect for his fellow creatures, and for him&s;elf? more attachment to his country? &s;tronger re|&s;i&s;tance to tyranny? greater contempt of death? You, who regret a virtuous friend, you love to think that the nobler part of his being has e&s;caped from
<PB N="144" REF="145">
death! You, who weep over the grave of a child, or of a wife, does <HI>he</HI> bring you con&s;olation who tells you that all which remains of them is but du&s;t? Unhappy victim, who expire&s;t under the &s;troke of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, thy la&s;t &s;igh is an appeal to eternal ju&s;tice! the tyrant turns pale upon his triumphal car at the &s;ight of inno|cence upon the &s;caffold. Would virtue have this a&s;cendancy if the tomb placed on the &s;ame level the oppre&s;&s;or and the oppre&s;&s;ed? Wretched &s;ophi&s;t! by what right do&s;t thou wre&s;t the &s;ceptre of rea&s;on from the hands of innocence, to intru&s;t it to tho&s;e of guilt? to throw a funereal veil over nature, to aggravate misfor|tune, to &s;ooth vice, to depre&s;s virtue, and degrade the human race?</P>
<P>"In proportion to the degree of genius and &s;en&s;ibility with which man is endued, he clings to tho&s;e ideas which aggrandize his being, and elevate his heart; and the doctrine of &s;uch men becomes that
<PB N="145" REF="146">
of the univer&s;e. Ah! &s;urely tho&s;e ideas mu&s;t have their foundation in truth! At lea&s;t I cannot conceive how nature could have &s;ugge&s;ted fictions to mankind more u&s;eful than realities; and if the exi&s;tence of God, if the immortality of the &s;oul, were but dreams, they would &s;till be the mo&s;t &s;ublime conceptions of the hu|man mind!"</P>
<P>Though we were not deceived as to the habitual character of Robe&s;pierre, we imagined that the overthrow of all the rival factions might have &s;oftened in &s;ome mea&s;ure his obdurate heart. Every pri&s;oner fondly looked forward to the fe&s;tival of the &s;upreme being as the epocha of liberty, or at lea&s;t of mercy.</P>
<P>"All the virtues," &s;ays Robe&s;pierre, "&s;hall contend for the right of prece|dency at our fe&s;tivals. Let us in&s;titute the fe&s;tival of glory; not of that glory which ravages and en&s;laves the world, but of that which enlightens, comforts,
<PB N="146" REF="147">
and gives it freedom; of that which, next to their country, is the chief object of wor&s;hip to generous minds. Let us in&s;titute another fe&s;tival more affecting &s;till; the fe&s;tival of misfortune. Wealth and power are the idols of &s;laves: let <HI>us</HI> honour misfortune; misfortune, which humanity cannot cha&s;e from the earth, but which it can &s;often and cheer. Thou al&s;o &s;halt receive our homage, divine friend&s;hip! thou who did&s;t here|tofore unite the hero and the &s;age; thou who give&s;t additional &s;trength to the lovers of their country; for whom traitors, a&s;&s;ociated for the purpo&s;es of guilt, have worn only the hypocritical marks of pretended re&s;pect; divine friend|&s;hip! among&s;t republican Frenchmen thy power &s;hall be acknowledged, and thy altars revered!"</P>
<P>However well Robe&s;pierre performed the hypocrite, he had not &s;ufficient ad|dre&s;s to pre&s;erve the character; for hu|manity,
<PB N="147" REF="148">
and misfortune, and glory, and friend&s;hip, enlightening and con&s;oling the world; and all the mockery and &s;how of the fe&s;tival, with all the hopes and expectations of the unfortunate pri|&s;oners, vani&s;hed into thin air. The fe&s;|tival, as has been related, took place on the 20th of Prairial; and on the 22d the law for condemnation <HI>in ma&s;s,</HI> without witne&s;s or defence, pa&s;&s;ed the conven|tion, and the work of death went on with redoubled &s;peed.</P>
<P>Had the tyrants who were thus &s;uc|ce&s;sful in their u&s;urpation, after cru&s;hing their immediate rivals, e&s;tabli&s;hed a more humane &s;y&s;tem of government, of which they would have been the protectors, the world might &s;till have remained ignorant at lea&s;t of the exce&s;s of their crimes; and might have attributed their &s;everity to the perilous circum&s;tances in which they were placed, by the coale&s;ced powers without, and the intrigues of the
<PB N="148" REF="149">
royal and ari&s;tocratical party within. In this ca&s;e, none of tho&s;e atrocious acts which the fall of Robe&s;pierre has unveil|ed would have been known, and what is now the &s;ubject of general horror would have been regarded only as nece&s;&s;ary evil.</P>
<P>The hi&s;torian, therefore, who &s;hould have taken the public acts, or the papers relating the tran&s;actions of the day, as the ba&s;is of his information, would have deceived him&s;elf and po&s;terity. And even now the ta&s;k will be difficult to tran&s;mit with accuracy and impartiality the hi&s;|tory of that extraordinary epocha; which furni&s;hes a mo&s;t awful and &s;tupendous monument of all that is &s;ublime, and ba&s;e; of all that is mo&s;t virtuous, and mo&s;t vile; of all that can excite mankind to the daring and heroic act, and of all that can make man with unutterable hor|ror fly from man as from a pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>The moment, however, was now ap|proaching when humanity was to be
<PB N="149" REF="150">
avenged of its tyrants for that long &s;cene of multiplied crimes, of which what pen can make the recapitulation? <Q REND="inline">There are times,</Q> Voltaire ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline">of horrors and of madne&s;s among man|kind, as there are times of pe&s;tilence; and this contagion has made the tour of the world.</Q> France has ju&s;t &s;een one of the&s;e epochas, which are the a&s;to|ni&s;hment, the terror, and the &s;hame of human nature. Happily they are rare in any hi&s;tory; and in the cour&s;e of the or|dinary calamities which are the &s;courge of civil &s;ociety, tho&s;e epochas may be con&s;idered as mortal maladies, amid&s;t that crowd of habitual infirmities which are in&s;eparable from our organization.</P>
<P>"When we dare reflect," &s;ays the il|lu&s;trious advocate of humanity, Servan, "on all that has ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, and repeat with a &s;igh, <HI>I al&s;o am a man,</HI> we know not at what we ought mo&s;t to blu&s;h&mdash;the crimes which human nature can commit,

<P>"We have &s;een what a wicked man would have blu&s;hed at fore&s;eeing, and what a good man would have feared to imagine; we have &s;een what tho&s;e who have committed would not have believ|ed in the hi&s;tory of others; we have &s;een in one moment, and as it were by a thun|der-bolt, the whole of France become only one frightful chaos, or rather one va&s;t conflagration; every principle, con|&s;ecrated by nece&s;&s;ity in every place, at all periods, and in every heart, &s;purned at or annihilated; the overthrow of every cu&s;tom, nay of prejudices and even ha|bits; the almo&s;t total exchange of pro|perty, which is more a&s;toni&s;hing than its ruin; beggary taking place of wealth, and wealth not daring to put it&s;elf into the place of beggary; in the mid&s;t of which, a band of villains, but a handful com|pared

<P>Though Danton was de&s;troyed, his party was &s;till numerous in the conven|tion; and it was a&s;&s;erted, that had he ap|peared at the tribune when he was ac|cu&s;ed, and denounced Robe&s;pierre, he would have &s;ent his rival to the &s;caffold. Robe&s;pierre, who was con&s;cious that he had not &s;ubdued the &s;pirit, though he had taken off the head, of the faction, thought, like Cae&s;ar, that nothing was done while any thing remained unfini&s;h|ed.

<P>The committees of public and general &s;afety, which were the committees of government, were ab&s;olute in their ad|mini&s;tration, and the convention had dwindled into the mo&s;t contemptible in|&s;ignificance. The deputies met to hear a report for the &s;ake of form, to clap their hands on the re-election of their tyrants when the periods arrived, or huzza at a carmagnol of Barrere; and were &s;ent away at four o'clock to dinner, to call again the next morning at twelve.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155">
Although Robe&s;pierre had &s;ucceeded in breaking them into this &s;ubordination, he had not &s;o entirely checked the ambi|tion of his fellow riders; for there were &s;ome, who, though better di&s;&s;emblers than the members of the late commune, beheld with as un&s;atisfied an eye the &s;tretches which Robe&s;pierre's faction were mak|ing; and which they &s;aw would pu&s;h them from their &s;eats, as they had aided him in removing others.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep towards the acqui&s;ition of ab&s;olute power was the concentration of all authority in the committee of pub|lic &s;afety. Robe&s;pierre had filled the vacant places in the commune with his own creatures, and the jacobins were his devoted &s;ubjects. All that remained, therefore, was to annihilate the powers of the committee of general &s;afety, which took care of the lives and properties of the citizens, while the other was charged with the external affairs and the gene|ral

To this propo&s;ition the members of the committee of general &s;afety did not di&s;|cover any readine&s;s to a&s;&s;ent; and though Robe&s;pierre had reigned with uncon|trolled &s;way &s;ince the death of the Gi|ronde, his a&s;cendancy over his a&s;&s;ociates had not reached &s;o far as to prevail with them to bend their necks, like the herd of the convention and the people, to his yoke.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;truggles had made a formal divi&s;ion at this period in the two com|mittees, which had con&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome time of two parties; but who&s;e coali|tion had been cemented hitherto by crimes and by blood. Robe&s;pierre's party in the committee of public &s;afety was compo&s;ed of St. Ju&s;t, Couthon, and Barrere; in that of general fafety, of David, Vadier, and &s;ome others; and though the&s;e committees were at ho&s;tili|ties

with each other, the intere&s;t of the ruffians was too clo&s;ely united to bring their quarrel before the public. The ambition of Robe&s;pierre embarra&s;&s;ed them much, and it was more than once propo&s;ed that recour&s;e &s;hould be had to the poniard. This plan, which was highly reli&s;hed by many members of the committee, was vehemently oppo&s;ed by a citizen, who, having been admitted into their councils, was often an in&s;tru|ment in the hands of providence of le&s;|&s;ening individual horrors, and of &s;aving many from de&s;truction. He repre&s;ented to them all the evils that would nece&s;&s;a|rily re&s;ult from &s;uch an act of premature violence; that they might indeed kill the tyrant, but that they would infallibly be the victims them&s;elves; that he would be con&s;idered by the people as a martyr, and they would be reputed his murder|ers; while forbearance and temporizing would pu&s;h him on to &s;ome act of in

<P>ROBESPIERRE, finding the com|mittee &s;o little inclined to pay him that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive homage which was yielded to him by the re&s;t of France, ab&s;ented him|&s;elf both from them and the conven|tion during &s;ome weeks; and began to prepare for open ho&s;tilities, with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the jacobins, the revolution|ary tribunal, and the regenerated com|mune. The united &s;trength of the&s;e bo|dies was very formidable, and the con|vention had nothing to oppo&s;e to them but the po&s;&s;ibility of exciting rebellion again&s;t the con&s;tituted authorities; for the military force was in the hands of Henriot, who was the devoted &s;lave of Robe&s;pierre; and the civil and revolu|tionary concerns of the &s;ections of Paris
<PB N="159" REF="160">
centred in the commune, the directors of which were of his immediate appoint|ment. The jacobins bore &s;way over the whole, and he was the ab&s;olute monarch of the jacobins.</P>
<P>When Robe&s;pierre thought that his plan was &s;ufficiently matured, he appear|ed at the tribune of the convention, which he had not entered for &s;ome time, and made a vehement harangue on the op|pre&s;&s;ion which was exerci&s;ed over him|&s;elf, and again&s;t the operations of the committees; promi&s;ing the convention, that he would propo&s;e the only means fitted to &s;ave the country.</P>
<P>His &s;peech excited much agitation; the members appeared to li&s;ten to him with &s;en&s;ations &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the in|habitants of &s;ome great city, who hear the murmurs of the earthquake, and feel the ground &s;hake beneath them, but are ignorant where the gulph will open, and what part, or if the whole, will be &s;wal|lowed

up. The convention, although alarmed, and doubtful how to act, yet &s;eeing the pro&s;pect of irremediable ruin before their eyes through the thin cover|ing which the tyrant had thrown over his de&s;igns, a&s;&s;umed &s;ufficient courage to debate on the prominent parts of his &s;peech, which they ordered to be printed.</P>
<P>Having opened him&s;elf thus far to the convention, Couthon explained the &s;peech more fully at the jacobins' in the evening. There he denounced the two committees of government as traitors, and in&s;i&s;ted that the per&s;ons who com|po&s;ed tho&s;e committees &s;hould be ex|cluded from the &s;ociety. The pre&s;ident of the revolutionary tribunal was the next commentator on Robe&s;pierre's &s;peech, and pronounced without any re|&s;erve, that the convention &s;hould be pu|rified al&s;o; which implied the entire di&s;|&s;olution of the repre&s;entative body.</P>
<P>This purification was not to be con|fined
<PB N="161" REF="162">
to the convention; for the con|&s;piracy again&s;t the republic had, to borrow the language of the&s;e regenera|tors, its authors and accomplices in every quarter of Paris. The fate of one de&s;cription of tho&s;e con&s;pirators was &s;o certain, that their graves were literally dug before their eyes, and graves of no ordinary extent. The&s;e were the multi|tude of pri&s;oners who were waiting a more formal, but not le&s;s certain death, before the revolutionary tribunal. It had been propo&s;ed to build a &s;caffolding in the great hall of the Palais, re&s;embling the hall of We&s;tmin&s;ter, where two or three hundred might be tried at once, in&s;tead of <HI>fifty</HI> or <HI>&s;ixty</HI> as was the pre&s;ent mode. But it was now thought the great ends of national ju&s;tice might be better an&s;wered by what was called emptying the pri&s;ons at once; and that, as the &s;en|tence of the&s;e con&s;pirators was already pa&s;&s;ed, the formality of their appear|ance
<PB N="162" REF="163">
at a tribunal might be di&s;pen&s;ed with. For &s;ome days therefore labourers had been employed in &s;everal pri&s;ons of Paris, in making large excavations in their re|&s;pective court-yards; and it was not con|cealed from many of the pri&s;oners by their keepers, and even by the admini|&s;trators of the police, how they were to be filled up. We cannot he&s;itate in believing this new in&s;tance of atrocity, when we compare the revolutionary lan|guage held by the chiefs on the nece&s;&s;ity of quick expedients to get rid of traitors, together with the changes made ju&s;t at this period in the keepers of the various pri&s;ons; &s;ince tho&s;e who had mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for firmne&s;s of nerve in the commi&s;&s;ion of murders, had &s;ucceeded the ordinary ruffians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The jailor mo&s;t celebrated for his atrocities was Benoit, who had been an executioner under the orders of Collot d'Herbois at Lyons, and who at this period was appointed keeper of the Luxem|bourg. His ferocious manners formed a lamentable contra&s;t with the gentlene&s;s of the <HI>good</HI> Benoit whom I have mentioned in my former letters. I &s;hall &s;ubjoin an article concerning him, which I have ju&s;t received from the gentleman who has tran&s;lated tho&s;e letters into the German language. See Appendix, No. III.</NOTE>;
<PB N="163" REF="164">
and al&s;o, what is more certain evidence, the information of many of the pri|&s;oners, who, confined in different pri&s;ons, agree in relating the &s;ame facts. There is al&s;o little doubt that the nobles and &s;trangers, who by the law of the fifteenth of Germinal were di&s;per&s;ed through the various communes of the republic, under the eye of tyrants, who were in|formed of their re&s;idence by the deca|dary returns of the &s;everal municipali|ties which they inhabited, would have &s;hared the fate of the pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The convention in the mean time ob&s;erved their u&s;ual &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;ilence, although they well knew that certain
<PB N="164" REF="165">
portions of them were de&s;ignated, li&s;ts of pro&s;cription having been di&s;covered from the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e who were to co-operate in the bloody work. One was found by accident among the papers of Vilate, one of the revolutionary jury, who, being refractory on &s;ome particular point, had been arre&s;ted.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;tate of &s;tupefaction which had led the convention to &s;ee former ma&s;&s;es torn from their body, &s;eemed &s;till to benumb their faculties. Robe|&s;pierre, who&s;e &s;ece&s;&s;ion from the com|mittees had not rendered him le&s;s the ma&s;ter of their operations, flattered him|&s;elf that the ta&s;k was now perfectly ea&s;y; for, independent of his irre&s;i&s;tible pha|lanxes, the jacobins, the revolutionary committees, the regenerated commune, and the military force of Paris, the ter|ror which he had infu&s;ed into the con|vention came powerfully to his aid.</P>
<P>The hours of the tyrant were never|thele&s;s
<PB N="165" REF="166">
numbered, and the moment ap|proached when he was to make his ac|count with eternal ju&s;tice. The attack of Robe&s;pierre upon his colleagues on the morning of the 8th of Thermidor, and the commentary made by his accom|plices at the jacobins' the &s;ame evening, rou&s;ed the convention from their di&s;|honourable lethargy, and they became bold from de&s;peration.</P>
<P>The eventful day at length arrived, and both parties took their places in the hall of the convention with an air of affected calmne&s;s, while &s;ome ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of the day went on; for no one even of the pro&s;cribed members &s;eemed anxious to become the Curtius of the re&s;t, al|though the next meeting of the jaco|bins, or the next motion of the munici|pality, might have decided the arre&s;t of the whole of the convention, except Robe&s;pierre's faction. But St. Ju&s;t hav|ing a&s;cended the tribune, and begun a
<PB N="166" REF="167">
&s;peech in the &s;ame whining tone which Robe&s;pierre had u&s;ed the preceding day, complaining of the bad treatment he had received, and of the trea&s;on of his colleagues in the committee; Tallien, and Billaud Varennes, the former of whom was on the li&s;t of pro&s;cription, and the latter Robe&s;pierre's rival in the committee, overpowered his voice by their denunciations again&s;t the perfi|dious and horrible de&s;igns of the tyrants, which they unveiled to the convention. Robe&s;pierre, who was ignorant of this counter con&s;piracy, though he &s;aw a di&s;po&s;ition the preceding day to mu|tiny, was &s;truck as with a thunderbolt. He made at length &s;ome attempts to &s;peak; but his voice was drowned in the denunciations poured forth again&s;t him. Tallien in&s;i&s;ted on his arre&s;t: but the convention, under the impre&s;&s;ion of its habitual terror, contented it&s;elf with pronouncing that of his inferior agents;
<PB N="167" REF="168">
and it was not till Robe&s;pierre had mounted the tribune, and, with the air of a chief, called the convention a band of robbers, that Vadier, one of his former accomplices, obtained the vote of accu|&s;ation, by turning evidence again&s;t him. Robe&s;pierre, &s;eeing him&s;elf be&s;et on every &s;ide, threw a look of piercing indigna|tion towards his brother mountaineers, and reproached them for their cowardice. Hearing cur&s;es poured down upon him from every quarter, and &s;eeing that his kingdom was departed from him, he call|ed out in the fury of de&s;peration to be led to death; which the convention virtually decreed, in an unanimous vote of accu|&s;ation again&s;t him. His colleagues St. Ju&s;t, Couthon, Le Bas, and his own brother, were arre&s;ted at the &s;ame time, and after &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance were led away to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Thus far the convention had been &s;ucce&s;sful; for all parties had concurred
<PB N="168" REF="169">
in the humiliation of a tyrant, by whom all had been equally oppre&s;&s;ed. But the &s;cene which the city pre&s;ented was truly alarming. The jacobins, hearing of the in&s;urrection again&s;t Robe&s;pierre, imme|diately a&s;&s;embled. The commune, which was ordered to the bar of the convention, in&s;tead of obeying, rang the toc&s;in to call the citizens to arms. Henriot, the com|mander of the military force, who had been arre&s;ted and led to the committee of general &s;afety, was relea&s;ed, and pa|rading the &s;treets on hor&s;eback, while the cannoneers under his orders had loaded their pieces. Robe&s;pierre with his colleagues was delivered from pri&s;on by the admini&s;trators of the police, and, being in&s;talled at the hotel de ville, had outlawed the whole convention.</P>
<P>Had the con&s;pirators acted with ordi|nary &s;agacity; had they immediately marched their cannon again&s;t the con|vention, which for &s;ome hours was only
<PB N="169" REF="170">
guarded by a &s;mall number of armed citizens, the triumph of Robe&s;pierre and the municipality would have been com|plete. But, happily for humanity, they wa&s;ted tho&s;e moments in deliberations and harangues; whil&s;t the convention, taking courage at the goodne&s;s of its cau&s;e, and in the hope of &s;ome &s;parks of remaining virtue in the people, di&s;covered a di&s;po&s;ition to defend them&s;elves, and in a &s;hort time thou&s;ands &s;lew to their aid. The hall of the jacobins was cleared by the energy of Legendre; and &s;even deputies were named as generals for the conventional cau&s;e again&s;t the commune, who were now declared to be in a &s;tate of rebellion, and put out of the law. Such at this moment was the &s;tate of Paris, when the commander of the mi|litary force, Henriot, appeared in the court of the convention, and ordered it to &s;urrender. But he came too late: the convention was now prepared for de|fence,
<PB N="170" REF="171">
and an&s;wered his &s;ummons by put|ting him out of the law as well as his employers.</P>
<P>This "hors la loi" has the &s;ame effect on a Frenchman as if it were the cry of the pe&s;tilence: the object becomes civil|ly excommunicated, and a &s;ort of con|tamination is apprehended if you pa&s;s through the air which he has breathed. Such was the effect which this decree produced upon the cannoneers, who had planted their artillery again&s;t the con|vention: without receiving any further in&s;tructions, except hearing that the com|mune were "hors la loi," they in&s;tantly turned their pieces. Henriot, &s;eeing this unexpected re&s;i&s;tance, and finding that the &s;ections meant to deliberate before they put the convention to death, &s;lunk back to the commune, who were al&s;o in a profound &s;tate of deliberation. In the mean time the convention had &s;ent deputies into every quarter of the
<PB N="171" REF="172">
town, to rally the citizens around the a&s;|&s;embly; and they &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that in a few hours the convention had an hundred thou&s;and men to march again&s;t the commune. The hotel de ville was now be&s;ieged in its turn; and might have made a formidable re&s;i&s;tance, had not the cannoneers of that quarter al&s;o heard of the "hors la loi," and refu&s;ed to fire their pieces; while the immen&s;e multitude that were idly a&s;&s;embled in the place de Greve before the hotel, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the carriages of the artillery to &s;erve as ladders, from which they could &s;tare into the windows, and crowds were mounted on the cannon to enjoy the &s;pectacle. The con&s;pirators now, aban|doned, and, like Nero, having no friend or enemy at hand to di&s;patch them, had no means of e&s;caping from ignominy but by a voluntary death, which they had not the courage to give them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Catiline, it is &s;aid, was found at a con|&s;iderable

di&s;tance from his friends, mingled among&s;t his enemies, with a countenance bold and daring in death. It is &s;omewhat remarkable, that nearly two years &s;ince a writer, drawing the parallel, or rather the di&s;&s;imilitude of character between Catiline and Robe&s;|pierre, ob&s;erved, that whenever the de|ci&s;ive moment of conte&s;t &s;hould ari&s;e between the parties which were formed after the 10th of Augu&s;t, Robe&s;pierre would peri&s;h; not plunged into the ranks of his foes, but be &s;truck by &s;ome ig|noble hand, and die from a wound in his back.</P>
<P>The con&s;pirators, &s;eeing that all re&s;i&s;t|ance was fruitle&s;s, hid them&s;elves or took to flight. Robe&s;pierre was found in an apartment of the hotel, and was &s;ternly reminded by a gendarme that a &s;upreme being really exi&s;ted. Robe&s;pierre held a knife in his hand, but had not courage to u&s;e it; the gendarme fired at him with a
<PB N="173" REF="174">
pi&s;tol, and broke his jaw-bone; he fell, without uttering a word. His brother threw him&s;elf out of a window, and broke his thigh by the fall. Henriot had given his a&s;&s;ociates the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances that he was &s;ecure of the military force of Pa|ris; and Coffinhal, a judge of the revolu|tionary tribunal, when he &s;aw that all was lo&s;t, poured forth the mo&s;t bitter invec|tives again&s;t Henriot for having thus de|ceived them; and at length &s;eizing him, in a fit of rage and de&s;pair, threw him out of a window. Henriot concealed him&s;elf a &s;hort time in a common-&s;ewer, from whence he was dragged after having lo&s;t an eye. The&s;e criminals, with their ac|complices, were brought, &s;ome on biers and others on foot, to the convention; from whence they were all &s;ent to the Conciergerie, except Robe&s;pierre, who was carried into the anti-chamber of the committee of public &s;afety, where tho&s;e who attended him told me he lay &s;tretch|ed
<PB N="174" REF="175">
motionle&s;s on a table four hours, with his head bound up, and his eyes &s;hut; making no an&s;wer to the taunting que&s;|tions that were put to him, but pinch|ing his thighs with convul&s;ive agony, and &s;ometimes looking round when he ima|gined no one was near. He underwent the operation of dre&s;&s;ing his wounds, in order to prolong his exi&s;tence a few hours; after which he was &s;ent, with the re&s;t of his a&s;&s;ociates, to the tribunal. The identification of their per&s;ons was all that was nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince they were <HI>hors la loi,</HI> and the &s;entence of execution again&s;t them was demanded by their for|mer friend, Fouquier Tainville.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 10th of Thermi|dor (the 28th of July 1794), the&s;e crimi|nals were led to the &s;caffold. The frantic joy which the Pari&s;ians di&s;covered on this occa&s;ion was equal to the pu&s;illani|mous &s;tupor into which they had been hitherto plunged. The maledictions
<PB N="175" REF="176">
that accompanied the tyrants on their way to execution were not, as u&s;ual, the clamour of hireling furies; they proceed|ed with hone&s;t indignation from the lips of an oppre&s;&s;ed people, and bur&s;t invo|luntarily from the heart of the fatherle&s;s and the widow. The&s;e mon&s;ters were made to drink the cup of bitterne&s;s to the very dregs. Many of them were &s;o disfi|gured by wounds and brui&s;es, that it was difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h their per&s;ons, and little attention had been paid to alleviate the&s;e intermediate &s;ufferings. In the ma&s;s peri&s;hed Robe&s;pierre, his co-adjutors Couthon and St. Ju&s;t; Henriot, the com|mander of the military force of Paris; the mayor of Paris; the national agent; the pre&s;ident of the jacobins; the pre&s;ident of the revolutionary tribunal; the &s;ans|culotte preceptor of the young dauphin; and the agents of the&s;e leaders, to the number of twenty-two. The following day the members of the commune of
<PB N="176" REF="177">
Paris, to the amount of &s;eventy-two, were beheaded on the place de Greve; and twelve, on the day after, completed the li&s;t of the chiefs of the pre&s;ent con&s;piracy.</P>
<P>The bar of the convention, which had hitherto been the echo of the tyrants, ap|plauding every barbarous mea&s;ure, and &s;anctioning every atrocious deed, now re&s;ounded with gratulation and triumph upon the victory, and a&s;&s;urances, &s;ince it was gained, that tho&s;e who offered the addre&s;s would have &s;hed the la&s;t drop of blood to have obtained it; or, according to the accu&s;tomed phra&s;e, "have made a rampart of their bodies." This incon|&s;i&s;tency on the part of the Pari&s;ians will not appear &s;urpri&s;ing, when we reflect that the city was divided into two par|ties&mdash;the murderers, who were now over|thrown, and tho&s;e who were to have been murdered, and who now exulted in their deliverance.</P>

<P>The inhabitants of tho&s;e <HI>living &s;epul|chres,</HI> the pri&s;ons of Paris, felt with mo&s;t ec&s;tacy this happy revolution. Hope had entirely for&s;aken them; they had re|&s;igned them&s;elves in fixed de&s;pair to that fate, which they believed to be inevi|table.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners knew that &s;ome extra|ordinary &s;cenes were pa&s;&s;ing in the city; for in all the pri&s;ons they had been or|dered to retire to re&s;t one hour earlier than u&s;ual, and to leave their doors un|locked; and at the &s;ame time they ob|&s;erved

while &s;ome relaxation from their habi|tual &s;everity &s;ucceeded the extraordinary precautions and rigour of the preceding day.</P>
<P>They were not however long held in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. In &s;ome of the pri&s;ons the new&s;paper of the pa&s;t evening was pro|cured at an enormous price: but who could rate too high the purcha&s;e which brought the tidings of deliverance? In &s;ome of the pri&s;ons, the citizens who were obliged to perform the painful office of guards within their gloomy courts, contrived to tell the pri&s;oners in mono&s;yllables breathed in whi&s;pers (for all intercour&s;e between the guards and the pri&s;oners was &s;ternly prohibited), that the hour of hope and mercy beamed upon their &s;ufferings. In other pri&s;ons they were informed of what was pa&s;&s;ing, by women who di&s;played upon the roofs of hou&s;es, which overlooked at a di&s;tance
<PB N="180" REF="181">
the pri&s;on walls, the names of Robe&s;|pierre and his a&s;&s;ociates, written in &s;uch broad characters that the pri&s;oners with the aid of gla&s;&s;es could read them plainly; and after pre&s;enting the name, the gene|rous informer &s;hewed by expre&s;&s;ive ge&s;|tures, that the head of him who bore that name had fallen.</P>
<P>A military gentleman who was con|fined in the pri&s;on of the Abbey told me, that, after having pa&s;&s;ed the night of the 27th of July, in the immediate ex|pectation of being ma&s;&s;acred, all his fears were in&s;tantly relieved by a very &s;light circum&s;tance. The pri&s;oners had long been denied the con&s;olation of any inter|view with their friends; the utmo&s;t pri|vilege allowed them was that of writing upon the direction of the packets of li|nen, when they were &s;ent to their hou&s;es to be wa&s;hed, or received from thence, after a very &s;trict examination, "Je me
<PB N="181" REF="182">
porte bien<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am well.</NOTE>." The wife of this gentle|man, to whom &s;he was tenderly attached, u&s;ed every day to write with an aching heart upon the packet, "Je me porte bien." On the morning of the 28th of July, the packet arrived as u&s;ual; but one mono&s;yllable and one note of ad|miration were added to the direction: "Ah, que je me porte bien<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ah, how well I am!</NOTE>!" With an emotion of tran&s;port which told him his misfortunes were at an end, he read tho&s;e little words, and hailed the ble&s;&s;ed augur.</P>
<P>During many hours the fall of the tyrant was repeated with cautious timi|dity through the dreary man&s;ions of con|finement, and the pri&s;oners related to each other the eventful tale, as if they feared that
<Q><L>More than echoes talked along the walls.</L></Q>
Even the minds of tho&s;e who were at li|berty,
<PB N="182" REF="183">
were too &s;trongly fettered by ter|ror to bear the &s;udden expan&s;ion of joy; and the gentleman who fir&s;t brought the tidings to my family that Robe&s;pierre was arre&s;ted, after having been blamed for his imprudence in mentioning &s;uch a circum&s;tance before &s;ome &s;trangers who were pre&s;ent, &s;aid in a tone of re&s;entment, "This is the fourth family which I have endeavoured to make happy by this news; and in&s;tead of being thanked for the intelligence, all are afraid to hear it."</P>
<P>At length, however, the clouds of doubt, mi&s;tru&s;t, and apprehen&s;ion va|ni&s;hed, the clear &s;un&s;hine of joy beamed upon every heart, and every eye was bathed in tears of exultation. Yet tho&s;e overwhelming emotions were empoi&s;on|ed by bitter regrets. Every individual had to lament &s;ome victim to whom he was bound by the ties of nature, of grati|tude, or of affection; and many were doomed to mourn over a friend, a father,
<PB N="183" REF="184">
or a hu&s;band, whom a month, a week, a day would have &s;natched from death. With peculiar pangs tho&s;e victims were regretted, who were led to execution, to the number of nearly &s;ixty, on the 27th of July, without guards, the military having been called to the aid of the con|vention on the arre&s;t of Robe&s;pierre. It was recollected when too late, it was re|echoed through Paris with a general feeling of remor&s;e, that one word might have re&s;cued tho&s;e la&s;t martyrs of tyranny from death, and that yet they were &s;uf|fered to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>If any private individual had from the gallery, or at the bar of the convention, demanded a re&s;pite, there is no doubt it would immediately have been granted. The heart dilates at the idea of that &s;ub|lime happine&s;s which he would have prepared for him&s;elf, who &s;hould thus have re&s;cued the innocent. What evil could malignity or misfortune have in|flicted
<PB N="184" REF="185">
upon a mind, which could have re|pelled them with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch an action? But tyranny, like "guilt, makes cowards of us all;" every man trembled for him&s;elf; the event of the day yet hung in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and the &s;uf|ferers were left to die.</P>
<P>Soon after the execution of Robe&s;|pierre, the committee of general &s;afety appointed a deputation of its members to vi&s;it the pri&s;ons, and &s;peak the words of comfort to the pri&s;oners; to hear from their own lips the motives of their cap|tivity, and to change the bloody rolls of pro&s;cription into regi&s;ters of promi&s;ed freedom. In the mean time orders for liberty arrived in glad &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and the pri&s;ons of Paris, &s;o lately the abodes of hopele&s;s mi&s;ery, now exhibited &s;cenes which an angel of mercy might have contemplated with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;ons relea&s;ed from the Luxembourg were mon&s;. and madame
<PB N="185" REF="186">
Bitauby, two days after the fall of Robe|&s;pierre. When they departed, the pri|&s;oners, to the amount of nine hundred per&s;ons, formed a lane to &s;ee them pa&s;s; they embraced them, they bathed them with tears, they overwhelmed them with benedictions, they hailed with tran&s;port the moment which gave them&s;elves the earne&s;t of returning freedom: but the &s;oul has emotions for which the lips have no utterance, and the feelings of &s;uch moments may be imagined, but cannot be defined.</P>
<P>Crowds of people were con&s;tantly a&s;|&s;embled at the gates of the pri&s;ons, to enjoy the luxury of &s;eeing the pri&s;oners &s;natched from their living tombs, and re&s;tored to freedom: that very people, who had beheld in &s;tupid &s;ilence the daily work of death, now melted in tears over the &s;ufferers, and filled the air with acclamations at their relea&s;e.</P>
<P>Among a multitude of affecting &s;cenes

which pa&s;&s;ed at tho&s;e pri&s;on-doors, where the wife, after a &s;eparation like that of death, again embraced her hu&s;band&mdash;where children clung upon the necks of their long-lo&s;t parents&mdash;none were more intere&s;ting than the unbounded tran&s;|ports of a little boy of &s;ix years of age, the &s;on of mon&s;. de F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, when his father met him at the gate, and while he pre&s;&s;ed him in his arms with an emotion which choked his voice. This child was particularly remarked, having en|gaged the affections of many per&s;ons in the neighbourhood by his behaviour dur|ing his father's long confinement. He had never failed to come every day bounding along the terrace of the Lux|embourg, till he approached the walls of the pri&s;on; and when he reached the &s;entinel, he always pulled off his hat very re&s;pectfully, and, looking up in his face with a &s;upplicating air, enquired, <HI>Citoyen, vous me permettrez de &s;aluer mon</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="188">
<HI>papa</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Citizen, you will give me leave to ki&s;s my hand to my papa?</NOTE>? and unle&s;s when he &s;poke to tho&s;e "who never had a &s;on," his petition was generally granted. He then u&s;ed to ki&s;s his hands again and again to his fa|ther, and play over his &s;portive tricks before him, while the parent's tears fol|lowed each other in &s;wift &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>All the little artifices which affection had prompted to cheat the watchful &s;eve|rity of unrelenting jailors, and &s;often the agonies of &s;eparation by the charm of mutual intercour&s;e, were now di&s;clo&s;ed. And it was found that love and friend|&s;hip had been more vigilant than &s;u&s;pi|cion it&s;elf; had eluded its wakeful eye; and, in &s;pite of triple bolts, and guards, and &s;pies, had poured forth tho&s;e effu|&s;ions of tenderne&s;s, tho&s;e a&s;&s;urances of fidelity not to be &s;haken by the frown of tyrants, which cheered the gloom of the pri&s;on, and awakened in the heart
<PB N="188" REF="189">
of the captive tho&s;e luxurious feelings that ari&s;e when <Q><L>&mdash;&s;weet remembrance &s;ooths</L>
<L>With virtue's kinde&s;t looks the aching brea&s;t,</L>
<L>And turns our tears to rapture.</L></Q> Sometimes pieces of paper carele&s;sly torn, and &s;ent at different periods wrapped round fruit or vegetables, when the &s;cat|tered &s;craps were rejoined by the pri|&s;oner, communicated the tidings he was mo&s;t anxious to hear. Sometimes a tender billet was found inclo&s;ed within a roa&s;ted fowl; and when the period arrived at which no nouri&s;hment was &s;uffered to be &s;ent to the pri&s;oners, the fainting frame was occa&s;ionally revived by rich and cordial wines, which were conveyed on the pretence of &s;ickne&s;s, labelled as bottles of medicine. But one of the pious frauds mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully employed was the agency of a dog. His ma&s;ter was confined in the pri&s;on of the Lux|embourg,
<PB N="189" REF="190">
and the faithful animal con|trived every day to get into the pri&s;on, and penetrate as far as his chamber, when he u&s;ed to overwhelm him with care&s;&s;es, and &s;eem to participate in his di&s;tre&s;s. His wife, who was at liberty, but deprived of all intercour&s;e with her hu&s;band, u&s;ed to care&s;s the dog upon his return from the pri&s;on with the &s;ame kind of emotion with which Werter gazed upon the little ragged boy whom he &s;ent to &s;ee Charlotte when he was pre|vented from &s;eeing her him&s;elf. At length the idea &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf to the lady of inclo&s;ing a billet within the dog's collar; &s;he contrived to give her hu&s;band &s;ome intimation of her &s;cheme, which &s;he immediately put in practice. From that period the four-legged courier, fur|ni&s;hed with his invi&s;ible packet, march|ed boldly forward every day at the ap|pointed hour through ho&s;ts of foes, and, in defiance of revolutionary edicts, laid
<PB N="190" REF="191">
his di&s;patches and his per&s;on at his ma&s;|ter's feet.</P>
<P>Paris was now converted into a &s;cene of enthu&s;ia&s;tic plea&s;ure. The theatres, the public walks, the &s;treets, re&s;ounded with the &s;ongs of rejoicing; the people indulged them&s;elves in all the frolic gai|ety which belongs to their character; and all the world knows that joy is no where &s;o joyous as at Paris, which &s;eems the natural region of Plea&s;ure, who, though &s;cared away for a while by &s;ullen ty|rants, &s;oon returns upon her light wing, like the wandering dove, and appears to find on no other &s;pot her proper place of re&s;t.</P>
<P>Upon the fall of Robe&s;pierre, the ter|rible &s;pell which bound the land of France was broken; the &s;hrieking whirl|winds, the black precipices, the bottom|le&s;s gulphs, &s;uddenly vani&s;hed; and re|viving nature covered the wa&s;tes with flowers, and the rocks with verdure.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="192">
All the fountains of public pro&s;perity and public happine&s;s were indeed poi&s;on|ed by that malignant genius, and there|fore the &s;treams have &s;ince occa&s;ionally run bitter; but the waters are regaining their purity, are returning to their natu|ral channels, and are no longer di&s;turb|ed and &s;ullied in their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, in a &s;hort time, &s;end you an account of the events which have &s;uc|ceeded the fall of Robe&s;pierre, and which wind up the &s;ingular drama of re|volutionary government conformably to the mo&s;t rigid rules of poetical ju&s;tice; or rather let me &s;ay, that we &s;ee heaven calming the doubts of human weakne&s;s on its my&s;terious ways, by the triumph of innocence and the expiation of guilt.</P>
<P>The eventful &s;cenes of the la&s;t winter will lead us to the pre&s;ent moment at which revolutionary government cea&s;es, and a new con&s;titution is pre&s;ented to the people of France. The ve&s;&s;el of

the &s;tate, built with toil and trouble, and cemented with blood, will &s;oon be launch|ed.

<OPENER><DATELINE>At the Pri&s;on of the Force, <DATE>December 5th, O. S. 5th Nivo&s;e.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t read the evening paper. I find my name in the decree of accu&s;ation propo&s;ed by Robe&s;pierre; in a few mo|ments, perhaps, I &s;hall be thrown into the dungeons of the Conciergerie. I know not on what grounds an indictment can be found again&s;t me, after four months having elap&s;ed &s;ince the trial of my fa|ther, during which time I have been in no re&s;pect inculpated; and I &s;hall find no difficulty in proving my innocence
<PB N="196" REF="196">
again&s;t any accu&s;ation whatever. Never|thele&s;s, the minds of the jury are &s;ome|times <HI>&s;o ea&s;ily and &s;o &s;uddenly convinced,</HI> that I feel it is my duty to throw a few lines on paper to fill up what I may omit at the tribunal. I am trying to conjec|ture what may be imputed to me. I owe it to my &s;on, to my wife, to my friends, and may at lea&s;t an un&s;ullied reputation be an heritage which no tribunal can take away! And fir&s;t, I find my name joined with tho&s;e of Biron and Dietrich. [Here he ob&s;erves that his connections with either were of too &s;light a nature to be imputed by the tyrants to him as a crime; though he con&s;iders them both as men of character and integrity. He then continues:] It is probably on the &s;ubject of my diplomatic career at the epocha prior to the war, when I was &s;ent on a &s;ecret mi&s;&s;ion to the duke of Brun&s;|wick, that I am about to be que&s;tioned. The nature of this la&s;t negotiation would
<PB N="197" REF="197">
have impo&s;ed &s;ilence on me for ever, if powerful rea&s;ons and imperious nece&s;&s;ity did not oblige me to break it at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter Narbonne, whom I know but &s;lightly, and with whom I never had any other connection than that of which I am going to &s;peak, &s;ent to me at Stra&s;|bourg, where I was at the end of Novem|ber 1791, and informed me that the king was de&s;irous of &s;ending me to the duke of Brun&s;wick to propo&s;e to him to take the command in chief of the French ar|mies. On the fir&s;t view, this project ex|cited only doubts and objections in my mind. Narbonne was pre&s;&s;ing, and &s;eem|ed anxious for the regeneration of the army, and the &s;olid e&s;tabli&s;hment of the con&s;titution. He gave me, as well as his colleague the mini&s;ter of foreign affairs, Le&s;&s;art, proofs and indications by which I believed, and was bound to believe, that Lewis the &s;ixteenth was equally &s;olicitous on this account. I never &s;aw Le&s;&s;art but
<PB N="198" REF="198">
two or three times; he appeared to adopt, though with le&s;s warmth, the project of Narbonne, and begged me to compo&s;e a memorial on this &s;ubject, detailing the different con&s;iderations which I had pre|&s;ented. When I &s;poke of the impo&s;&s;ibi|lity of &s;ucceeding in &s;uch a negotiation, Narbonne denied this, and agreed only in admitting that there might be &s;ome difficulties.</P>
<P>When I &s;poke of the impre&s;&s;ion it might po&s;&s;ibly make on the public, and the influence it would have on the cau&s;e of liberty, he an&s;wered that the be&s;t pa|triots were in raptures at the project, and that its &s;ucce&s;s alone, by giving us con|&s;ideration abroad, and order in the army; would prevent a war, and &s;ecure us again&s;t any fear of foreign inva&s;ion, on account of the reputation and great ta|lents of the duke of Brun&s;wick. I at length wrote the memorial which the two mini&s;ters had reque&s;ted. I pre&s;ented
<PB N="199" REF="199">
in a forcible manner the almo&s;t in&s;ur|mountable difficulties which re&s;ulted from the political and military character of the duke of Brun&s;wick, from his quality as prince of the empire, as chief of the elde&s;t branch of the hou&s;e of Hanover, the ally of that of Pru&s;&s;ia. I al&s;o ob&s;erved, that whoever &s;hould undertake &s;uch a mi&s;|&s;ion ought to be authorized to &s;peak of affairs foreign to this &s;pecial propo&s;ition; and I concluded by &s;aying, that if I un|dertook it, I was almo&s;t certain of return|ing without having made the lea&s;t pro|gre&s;s in this delicate bu&s;ine&s;s; and that I was determined not to hazard &s;uch a propo&s;ition, if there was any danger of its being received in a manner injurious to the dignity of the national character, and without that re&s;pect and attention which could alone ju&s;tify its being made.</P>
<P>My memorial was read in the council, and Lewis the &s;ixteenth and his mini&s;ters
<PB N="200" REF="200">
decided on my departure. The mini&s;ters of foreign affairs and of war, for I never &s;aw but tho&s;e two, gave me the informa|tion.</P>
<P>Had I had thirty or fifty years of ex|perience, which I think I have &s;ince ac|quired, I &s;hould have held fa&s;t to my ob|jections, and &s;hould have remained at home; but being only twenty-three years of age, I departed; determined never|thele&s;s to pre&s;erve the circum&s;pect con|duct I had pre&s;cribed my&s;elf. It will be &s;een by my four di&s;patches from Brun&s;|wick annexed, that the kind reception which the duke gave me, his conver&s;a|tion, which was intere&s;ting, and &s;ome|times &s;ufficiently philo&s;ophic to induce me to think that he approved of many things in the French revolution, led me to make overtures. It will be ob&s;erved al&s;o, that having fore&s;een the little pro|bability of &s;ucce&s;s in this enterpri&s;e, I
<PB N="201" REF="201">
broke &s;ilence only becau&s;e I had the cer|tainty of producing an impre&s;&s;ion, at which I my&s;elf was a&s;toni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are well acquainted with the duke of Brun&s;wick, will readily per|ceive that my recital is exact, and will find his character in tho&s;e conver&s;ations; but a circum&s;tance which I ought not to have related at that time determined me more &s;trongly to open to him the &s;ubject of my mi&s;&s;ion. I was on the point of leaving Brun&s;wick without having &s;po|ken of any thing but the general intere&s;ts of France with re&s;pect to the empire, when I heard the calumnious reports which were &s;pread relative to the mini&s;ter Segur at Berlin; accu&s;ations of perfidious projects, of corrupted and &s;candalous mea&s;ures unworthy of a free people, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s ought to be founded only on its &s;trength and its virtue. My &s;ilence would al&s;o have expo&s;ed me to tho&s;e
<PB N="202" REF="202">
vile &s;u&s;picions, and I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed for a man who was labouring in the &s;ame &s;pirit, and practi&s;ing the &s;ame manoeuvres at Brun&s;wick in a &s;ubordinate commi&s;|&s;ion, and of having only worn the ma&s;k on account of the bad &s;ucce&s;s of Segur: I went therefore directly to the point, in order to clear up the whole.</P>
<P>It will be &s;een that the propo&s;ition was received <HI>more than decently</HI> (plus que d&eacute;cemment), and that the an&s;wers of the duke left me room to return, and to dwell on it with probability of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Soon after appeared that vitiated poli|tical &s;y&s;tem, and which I am far from the &s;elf-reproach of not having oppo&s;ed, which armed all the princes of Europe again&s;t us, and drew us &s;ome months af|ter into a general war.</P>
<P>A few decrees adopted by the legi&s;la|tive a&s;&s;embly with re&s;pect to foreign pow|ers, de&s;troyed the hopes which I &s;till re|tained;
<PB N="203" REF="203">
and I wrote, that no further ideas mu&s;t be entertained of &s;ucce&s;s. Such was the conclu&s;ion of this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Le&s;&s;art and Narbonne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See their letters, which I received at Berlin.</NOTE> had written to me in the mo&s;t flattering manner on the opening and progre&s;s of the nego|tiation; and I an&s;wered them, as may be &s;een by my di&s;patches, that having &s;een the duke of Brun&s;wick again after fifteen days ab&s;ence, I had found him totally changed in his di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons then &s;aid, that the object of this mi&s;&s;ion was to operate a change of dyna&s;ty in France in favour of the duke of Brun&s;wick. This report, I am told, had circulated in England, and aro&s;e in the beginning from the divi&s;ions between Lameth and Narbonne. In tho&s;e kinds of quarrels every means of doing injury are employed with too much indifference. This &s;ecret and concealed project has
<PB N="204" REF="204">
&s;ince been imputed to Narbonne. The idea never came into my mind; and be|&s;ides I believed, and had every rea&s;on to believe my&s;elf &s;ufficiently &s;ecure again&s;t any apprehen&s;ion of this &s;ort, by the agreement and formal con&s;ent of Lewis the &s;ixteenth, and perhaps &s;till more by the equal adherence of the two mini&s;ters Nar|bonne and Le&s;&s;art, who were enemies, and who would not have failed to take advantage of &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion to have op|po&s;ed and ruined each other, if there had been any foundation for &s;o doing. As for my&s;elf, could I have been the in&s;tru|ment of &s;o abominable a project as that of giving new ma&s;ters to my country! Could I traffic with its throne, or its li|berty, to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of my own ambition, or that of any one in the world! I &s;hudder at the thought; and knowing no other foundation for the report than the idle a&s;&s;ertions of men whom the pa|triots have long &s;ince pro&s;cribed, I do
<PB N="205" REF="205">
not imagine that &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion can be formed again&s;t me in their minds.</P>
<P>The order to go to Berlin, and replace Segur, met me at Brun&s;wick. Our affairs were there ruined. I was therefore placed in a mo&s;t difficult and critical &s;ituation. I thought however, that being already as it were in the place, at an epocha already too long delayed, it was my duty to go. A circum&s;pect yet open conduct was my &s;afeguard amid&s;t this &s;tormy career. But the political &s;y&s;tem of that period, which did not fail to gain &s;oon a con&s;iderable a&s;cendancy, and which from the fir&s;t days of the admini&s;tration of Dumourier drew on the declaration of war again&s;t Au&s;tria, left it altogether impo&s;&s;ible for me to be|gin any important negotiation with &s;uc|ce&s;s. I refer for what remains, to my di&s;patches, where it will be &s;een that I had to &s;ucceed a man who&s;e mi&s;&s;ion was for peace; that the new admini&s;tration
<PB N="206" REF="206">
had changed the &s;y&s;tem; that the ac|knowledged di&s;po&s;itions of the Pru&s;&s;ian cabinet, which I had carefully ob&s;erved and minuted, impo&s;ed on me as my &s;e|vere&s;t ta&s;k to combat with our own go|vernment, and to de&s;troy and refute a thou&s;and fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, a thou&s;and fal&s;e hopes. But my di&s;patches contain every thing, ab&s;olutely every thing: I can only add &s;ome private letters, by which I endeavoured to &s;hew the impo&s;|&s;ibility of gaining any attention to vari|ous arguments which were pointed out to me with great confidence, and various means by which they flattered them&s;elves that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia would adopt our new political &s;y&s;tem. I did not conceal a &s;ingle moment what the intentions and &s;teps of the cabinet of Berlin were; and I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed on my return to hear Dumourier, who had overwhelmed me with compliments on my mode of

<P>I ALSO &s;aw the experiments which Marat publi&s;hed on light and fire, and which had excited my curio&s;ity. The independent character which that man, &s;ince become &s;o noted, di&s;played, in|duced me to &s;eek his acquaintance, and we became intimately connected. Marat related to me certain circum&s;tances of his life, which increa&s;ed my e&s;teem for him. He held him&s;elf forth as the apo&s;tle of liberty, and had written when in Eng|land, in 1775, a work on this &s;ubject, which was entitled <HI>The chains of &s;lavery.</HI> In this publication he unma&s;ked the cor|ruption of the court and of the admi|ni&s;tration. The work he told me had made a great noi&s;e in England, and that he had been rewarded by valuable pre|&s;ents, and by his admi&s;&s;ion into corpora|tions, and the freedom of &s;everal cities. He &s;poke to me of his connection with
<PB N="211" REF="211">
the celebrated Kau man; of his pro|digious &s;ucce&s;s in practice; which was &s;o great, that on his <HI>debut</HI> at Paris he was paid thirty-&s;ix livres every vi&s;it, and had not time &s;ufficient for all the con&s;ulta|tions to which he was called. Though he was very well lodged, I did not &s;ee that &s;ort of luxury which might have been the re&s;ult of the wealth that was &s;howered on him. But I have already ob|&s;erved that I was habitually credulous; and it is only in going over the differ|ent circum&s;tances of my connection with this dete&s;table man, in bringing into one point of view the part which he has acted in this revolution, that I have been con|vinced of the quackery which through his whole life directed and veiled his actions and his writings.</P>
<P>Marat told me, that having made great di&s;coveries in natural philo&s;ophy, he quitted practice, which at Paris was the profe&s;&s;ion only of a quack, and unworthy
<PB N="212" REF="212">
of him&s;elf. But while he renounced his profe&s;&s;ion he &s;old from time to time re|medies and bottles, the efficacy of which he warranted, and he was very careful to name the price. I recollect that, a wart on my hand having &s;truck his eye, he &s;ent me a bottle of very limpid water, for which I thanked him, and a&s;ked him the price, which was twelve livres. I made no u&s;e of the remedy. Marat had given me &s;ome mi&s;tru&s;t, if not of his &s;ucce&s;s, at lea&s;t of his medical knowledge. He told me one day, that, in order to cure him&s;elf of the colic, he wanted to have his belly opened, but that, happily for him, the &s;urgeon had not the complai&s;ance to comply with his de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Marat was &s;o entirely full of him&s;elf, of his di&s;coveries, and of the glory which he fancied he de&s;erved, that he did not appear to me to feel the &s;lighte&s;t impre&s;|&s;ion of beauty, and he was certainly little calculated to plea&s;e. Neverthele&s;s, he
<PB N="213" REF="213">
had found the &s;ecret of exciting an at|tachment in madame la marqui&s;e de L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, a woman who&s;e elegant mind rendered her conver&s;ation highly in|tere&s;ting. Being &s;eparated from her hu&s;|band, who was overwhelmed with debts, and di&s;honoured by a cour&s;e of infamous conduct, &s;he put her&s;elf under the care of Marat; who did not confine his at|tentions to her as a phy&s;ician, but was ambitious of &s;ucceeding the hu&s;band. This union for a long time a&s;toni&s;hed me. The lady was &s;oft, amiable, and good; and there was nothing &s;o di&s;gu&s;t|ing, violent, and &s;avage in dome&s;tic life as Marat.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t do him the ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve, that the rigour which he exerci&s;ed again&s;t others, he exerci&s;ed al&s;o on him&s;elf. In|&s;en&s;ible of the plea&s;ures of the table, and the enjoyments of life, he con&s;ecrated all his time and his money to philo|&s;ophical experiments. Employed night
<PB N="214" REF="214">
and day in repeating them, he would have been contented with bread and water, in order to have the plea&s;ure of humbling at &s;ome future day the academy of &s;ciences. This was the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of his ambition. Enraged at the aca|demicians, who had treated his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays with contempt, he thir&s;ted with the de|&s;ire of vengeance, and to overturn the fir&s;t of their idols, Newton; for which purpo&s;e he employed him&s;elf wholly in experiments de&s;tined to de&s;troy his prin|ciples of optics. To combat and over|throw the reputation of celebrated men, was his ruling pa&s;&s;ion: &s;uch was the motive which dictated the fir&s;t of his works, his treati&s;e on <HI>the principles of man,</HI> which appeared in 1775, in three vo|lumes, and which Voltaire burle&s;qued in his que&s;tions on the Encyclopaedia.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem of Helvetius was then in the greate&s;t vogue, and it was again&s;t Helvetius that Marat wi&s;hed to enter the
<PB N="215" REF="215">
li&s;ts. Certainly Voltaire was in the right to ridicule &s;ome of the propo&s;itions and extravagancies of Marat, but he did not do him ju&s;tice in other points of view.</P>
<P>The academicians, for in&s;tance, were violently animated again&s;t his experi|ments on light, on fire, and on electricity; and I have never &s;een any of them di&s;|tingui&s;h or acknowledge what was new or valuable in his experiments; nor did they wi&s;h his name even to be pro|nounced, &s;o fearful were they of con|tributing even by their critici&s;ms to his celebrity. I own that this inju&s;tice on the part of the cla&s;s of experimental phi|lo&s;ophers has always di&s;gu&s;ted me; and this was what dictated a chapter in my treati&s;e on truth, on academical preju|dice, page 353, which I compo&s;ed at the end of a long and warm di&s;pute I had with the geometrician La P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, which chapter is a faithful recital of this di&s;pute. La P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> might po&s;&s;ibly be in the right,
<PB N="216" REF="216">
and I might an&s;wer with too much har&s;h|ne&s;s; but I could not bear the in&s;olence and de&s;poti&s;m with which they treated a philo&s;opher, becau&s;e he did not like them&s;elves wear a gown.</P>
<P>I followed Marat's experiments for three years; and I thought that &s;ome e&s;|teem was due to a man who had buried him&s;elf in &s;olitude to enlarge the bounds of &s;cience: not indeed that this was his fir&s;t view; for he regarded only him&s;elf, he &s;peculated on the &s;ciences only for his own glory, and was anxious to rai&s;e his reputation on the wreck of that of others.</P>
<P>He had not failed to ob&s;erve, that journali&s;ts were privileged di&s;tributors of fame; but his vanity, in&s;olence, and arrogance, had made him totally neglect|ed by tho&s;e who&s;e good offices he &s;ought after. He knew that I was connected with many among&s;t them; and I believe it is to this circum&s;tance that I was indebted for that kind of attachment
<PB N="217" REF="217">
which he profe&s;&s;ed for me for &s;o many years. He was continually &s;ending to me extracts from his works, and criti|ci&s;ms written on them with his own hand. I never could have conceived that any one could have had the impudence to be&s;tow &s;o many prai&s;es on him&s;elf; but con&s;idering him only as a per&s;on &s;uf|fering under literary oppre&s;&s;ion, I ex|erted my&s;elf in making his works known, and I often &s;ucceeded. He never thanked me; and the rea&s;on was, that in &s;pite of my e&s;teem for his knowledge and his di&s;coveries, I did not fully &s;hare in the admiration which he complai&s;antly felt for him&s;elf; and being &s;ometimes in doubt as to the truth of his propo&s;itions, I undertook to &s;often his exaggerations, e&s;pecially in the prai&s;ing parts. This mo|de&s;ty which I felt on his account he never forgave.</P>
<P>As I earne&s;tly wi&s;hed for his &s;ucce&s;s, I continued to bring him new acquaint|ance
<PB N="218" REF="218">
to &s;ee his experiments. I know not by what fatality, every one left his hou&s;e very well plea&s;ed with his philo|&s;ophical feats, and very ill &s;atisfied with the philo&s;opher. He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with difficulty, his ideas were confu&s;ed; and as his vanity was ea&s;ily awakened by the &s;lighte&s;t oppo&s;ition, or the lea&s;t &s;ign of contempt or indifference, he became &s;uddenly enraged, and his fury ro&s;e to &s;uch a height, that his ideas were di&s;ordered, and he lo&s;t his recollection. I &s;aw one day a &s;triking in&s;tance of this inflammability: Volta, &s;o celebrated for his experiments on electricity, was very curious to &s;ee tho&s;e which Marat an|nounced as overturning the theory of Franklin; but &s;carcely had he repeated a few of them, and heard one or two objections, than, &s;u&s;pecting Volta's in|credulity, he in&s;ulted him gro&s;sly, in|&s;tead of an&s;wering his objections.</P>
<P>He was however con&s;cious of his
<PB N="219" REF="219">
difficulty in &s;peaking, and of his want of temper in conver&s;ation, which were the rea&s;on why he &s;ought the acquaintance of a literary man who had abilities for &s;peak|ing, and who could di&s;play his theory for him; after which he would have appear|ed in his temple like a god, to receive the incen&s;e of &s;imple mortals.</P>
<P>He made me this propo&s;ition &s;everal times. I objected on account of my timi|dity, and my ignorance in experimental philo&s;ophy. He promi&s;ed to initiate me in a &s;hort time into the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e my&s;teries of his di&s;coveries. I con&s;tant|ly per&s;i&s;ted in my refu&s;al, becau&s;e I did not wi&s;h to be any man's &s;econd; becau&s;e I never had any very &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for that branch of knowledge; becau&s;e I did not think my&s;elf &s;ufficiently &s;killed in making experiments; and in fine, be|cau&s;e my feelings led me rather to &s;hun Marat, than become more intimately connected with him. Curio&s;ity, and the
<PB N="220" REF="220">
wi&s;h to procure information, had made me &s;eek his acquaintance; the de&s;ire of being u&s;eful to him, becau&s;e he &s;eemed oppre&s;&s;ed, had induced me to keep up that acquaintance; but he had never in|&s;pired me with any of tho&s;e &s;entiments that con&s;titute the delight of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>It was from a &s;entiment of humanity that I procured him the &s;ale of his books, and little che&s;ts of in&s;truments; from the earne&s;tne&s;s which he di&s;covered in collecting the little profit of his works, I judged that he was in di&s;tre&s;s, although he had too much pride to ac|knowledge it. Alas! this &s;ervice, which I did him gratuitou&s;ly, has &s;ince fur|ni&s;hed him matter for treating me with the mo&s;t atrocious in&s;ults in one of his numbers. So far was I from withholding the money for his works, that I would have &s;hared my pur&s;e with him, had I then been provided for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have at all times done ju&s;tice to
<PB N="221" REF="221">
Marat, and I will continue to do &s;o, though I owe to him a part of the per|&s;ecutions which I am now &s;uffering. He was indefatigable in labour, and had great addre&s;s in making experiments; a tribute which I heard Franklin once render him, who was enchanted with his experiments on light. I cannot &s;ay &s;o much on tho&s;e for fire and electri|city. Marat thought he had made di&s;|coveries which overthrew the &s;y&s;tem of Franklin; but Franklin was not the dupe of his quackery. Le Roy, the academician, who was named commi&s;|&s;ary to examine his di&s;coveries on light, agreed that tho&s;e which he had made on the pri&s;m were ingenious, and that Ma|rat had a &s;ingular talent in making them. His report was in many re&s;pects favour|able, but &s;ome of the academicians forced him to &s;uppre&s;s it.</P>
<P>Marat was mo&s;t earne&s;tly &s;olicitous to obtain an eulogium from the academy
<PB N="222" REF="222">
of &s;ciences, and this earne&s;tne&s;s &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of a &s;tratagem which co&s;t him immen&s;e labour. He undertook mak|ing a new tran&s;lation of Newton's Prin|cipia on optics. This was a new mode of de&s;troying the &s;y&s;tem; for I have no doubt but that he made alterations in tran&s;lating it. He wi&s;hed the acade|my to give their approbation of this tran&s;lation; but his name would have excited their &s;u&s;picions, and led them to examine the work with more &s;everity. In order to avoid &s;u&s;picion, he propo&s;ed to many of his friends, to lend him their name; and he &s;ucceeded with Bau&s;&s;&eacute;e, the grammarian, a weak and ea&s;y man, who was not aware of Marat's manoeuvres. With Bau&s;&s;&eacute;e's name, the commi&s;&s;aries of the academy did not he&s;itate to give, without reading, their approba|tion and prai&s;es to the work of their ene|my. I cannot tell what advantage he reaped from it; for this tran&s;lation is un|known,
<PB N="223" REF="223">
though it is magnificently print|ed. Marat made me a pre&s;ent of a copy of it on vellum paper in the beginning of the revolution.</P>
<P>At this period Marat was poor, and lived wretchedly; and though &s;ince my return from America I have not con|ver&s;ed with him, I do not think that he has changed his principles. He is accu&s;ed of venality and corruption; but I have never forborne repeating, that he was above corruption. Marat had but one &s;ingle pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;that of being fore|mo&s;t in the career which he was running. Anxiety for fame was his di&s;ea&s;e, for he had not that of avarice. He was of a bilious habit, and pa&s;&s;ionate in his di&s;|po&s;ition, ob&s;tinate in his &s;entiments, and per&s;evering in his conduct. We may judge of his per&s;everance from one trait&mdash;that although he was under the greate&s;t embarra&s;&s;ment in &s;peaking, he has never|thele&s;s exhibited him&s;elf in every tri|bune.
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages">
<PB N="226" REF="224">
never impo&s;ed on me, for I had &s;een him too nearly. He was violent, but not courageous; under de&s;poti&s;m he was afraid of the Ba&s;tille, and &s;ince the reign of liberty he has been always in fear of pri&s;ons. I &s;hall mention two traits on this head to &s;hew his character.</P>
<P>Marat in 1780 was a candidate for the prize given by the oeconomical &s;o|ciety of Berne on the que&s;tion of the re|form of the criminal law. This &s;ociety delayed every year pronouncing its judg|ment. In 1782, I adverti&s;ed my collec|tion of criminal laws in ten volumes. Marat begged me to in&s;ert the memoir which he had addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;ociety. There was a boldne&s;s in this e&s;&s;ay which might prove di&s;agreeable to government. I a&s;ked Marat if he, wi&s;hed his name to appear. "By no means," an&s;wered he, "for the Ba&s;tille is there, and I do not much like to be &s;hut up:" and he left me to run the chance, as my name was at the head of the collection.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="225">
I met him one day in the Thuilleries, in 1786 or 87: it was a long time &s;ince I had &s;een him. We talked of his works, I a&s;ked him why he was &s;o bent on pur|&s;uing natural philo&s;ophy, when he had again&s;t him all the academies and all the philo&s;ophers. I advi&s;ed him to con|&s;ecrate his labours to politics. "It is time." I ob&s;erved to him, "to think of over|turning de&s;poti&s;m: join your labours to mine, and to tho&s;e enlightened men who have &s;worn its overthrow, and this un|dertaking will cover you with glory." Marat an&s;wered, that he would rather con|tinue his experiments in peace, becau&s;e philo&s;ophy did not lead to the Ba&s;tille; and he made me under&s;tand very plainly, that the French people were not &s;uffi|ciently ripe, nor &s;ufficiently courageous, to &s;upport a revolution.</P>
<P>When the Ba&s;tille was overthrown, Marat was no longer afraid of it, and quitted his cave. He even pretended at
<PB N="228" REF="226">
this period, that all the honours of this glorious revolution belonged to him&s;elf; and making up &s;ome &s;ort of &s;tory about a colonel of dragoons whom he had ar|re&s;ted on the Pont-Neuf, he entreated me to print it in the Patriote Fran&ccedil;ois. He be&s;towed &s;o many extravagant prai&s;es on him&s;elf in the account, that I could not carry my complai&s;ance &s;o far. I there|fore &s;truck out the prai&s;es, and publi&s;hed the fact; which Marat never forgave. As he de&s;paired of finding journali&s;ts who would flatter him, he undertook a jour|nal him&s;elf, which I adverti&s;ed with an eu|logium, in order to get him &s;ub&s;cribers: and in doing him this &s;ervice, which I never refu&s;ed to any of my brother jour|nali&s;ts, I thought I did &s;ervice to the public. Good God! how great was my error! and what was my &s;urpri&s;e, when I read &s;ome of his numbers! How was it po&s;&s;ible that a writer who had any re&s;pect for him&s;elf could become &s;o degraded as
<PB N="229" REF="227">
to make u&s;e of a &s;tyle &s;o vile, &s;candal|ous, and atrocious!</P>
<P>I own that I thought Marat a mean writer, an incon&s;i&s;tent logician, incredu|lous as to morals, ambitious, an enemy to all men of talents; but I did not think that he would violate every principle, every law, &s;o far as to calumniate the mo&s;t virtuous men, and preach ma&s;&s;acre and pillage ..... I &s;top here ..... And I fini&s;h with this reflection: Whatever in|jury Marat may have done me, I for+give; but I can never forgive him for having corrupted the morals of the peo|ple, and having in&s;pired them with a ta&s;te for blood; for without morals and without humanity there is no republic.</P>
<P>I have thought it right to enlarge with re&s;pect to this man, becau&s;e he is better known from that part of his life preced|ing the revolution than that which fol|lowed. Since 1789, he has been con|&s;tantly
<PB N="230" REF="228">
on &s;tilts; before that period, you &s;aw him at home, and more like him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of the provocations of Marat, I have never thought it right to reveal to the world the circum&s;tances which I have ju&s;t related. Per&s;onal di&s;cu&s;&s;ions have always been di&s;agreeable to me, and &s;eemed to me only fitted to &s;erve the pur|po&s;es of the enemies of the revolution.</P>

<P>WE find innumerable te&s;timonies in favour of this incomparable man. A per&s;on of ordinary humanity would have refu&s;ed &s;o di&s;agreeable a po&s;t, but Benoit was a <HI>hero in humanity.</HI> His noble &s;oul calculated only the quantity of good which he might be able to do in this &s;itu|ation in preference to any other, and the evil which he could prevent; both of which were attended with imminent danger to him&s;elf. He was not indeed expre&s;sly cho&s;en for this function; but being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place of con|cierge at the palace of the Luxembourg before the revolution, he was continued in his employment. Benoit is a native of Switzerland; he was born in a beautiful little village named Chamberlen, in the county of Neufchatel, at the di&s;tance of a league and a half from the town. I have had the &s;atisfaction to relate to his
<PB N="232" REF="230">
&s;i&s;ter, an hone&s;t farmer's wife of Cham|berlen, all the good that was &s;aid and written about her brother, and I tran&s;|lated tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages from mi&s;s Williams's letters. She wept for joy, and exclaimed with enthu&s;ia&s;m and exultation, that &s;he would relate to every one in her village all the good things that were &s;aid of her brother. As a mark of her gratitude, &s;he brought me from her home her apron|full of excellent <HI>moyel,</HI> a &s;ort of fruit the name of which I am unacquainted with.</P>
<P>I take occa&s;ion to add, that this excel|lent per&s;on was carried at length before the revolutionary tribunal, for the ex|erci&s;e of &s;ome act of humanity towards one of the mi&s;erable victims under his care. He e&s;caped; and, by one of tho&s;e &s;ingular providential occurrences which &s;eemed to have no direction but that of chance, I was the happy in&s;trument of his being &s;aved. The commi&s;&s;ary who arre&s;ted him, and upon who&s;e report
<PB N="233" REF="231">
and evidence his fate was &s;u&s;pended, happened to be my vi&s;itor at the moment; and I did not forget at this critical period the obligations my family owed to Benoit. The commi&s;&s;ary re|&s;pected my repre&s;entations and my en|treaties; the report and the evidence were &s;oftened, and Benoit's life was pre|&s;erved; which would otherwi&s;e have been forfeited, for he had in truth been guilty of the act of humanity with which he was charged.</P>
<P>Benoit is a prote&s;tant. He told us, when we were fir&s;t his pri&s;oners, that he had been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee us every Sunday at church; and we probably owed part of the &s;uperior kind treatment we ex|perienced to this con&s;ideration.
