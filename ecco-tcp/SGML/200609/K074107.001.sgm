<HEAD>SERMON I. RELIGION INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH ORDINARY LIFE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM cxvi. 9.</BIBL>
<Q>I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MAN is a being of a compound nature; he con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;oul and a body. By the former he is allied to God and angels; by the latter to earth and earthly <HI>things.</HI> In con&s;equence of this, he is capable of two different &s;orts of <HI>enjoyments,</HI> &s;ubjected to two di&s;tinct cla&s;&s;es of <HI>de&s;ires,</HI> and lives at once in two di&s;&s;imilar &s;tates. From the body ari&s;e appetites for worldly <HI>things,</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ure in them;</HI> from the &s;oul, de&s;ires of things &s;pi|ritual and eternal, and a reli&s;h for them. We live an animal or a natural life, and we live at the &s;ame time a rational or &s;piritual life. Thus
<PB N="2" REF="9">
by the very con&s;titution of our nature, our attention is drawn different ways, our views are directed to contrary objects, and we are engaged in di&s;&s;imilar employments. By con|cern about the one, we may become negligent of the other.</P>
<P>THE things of this world are the objects of &s;en&s;e; they are continually &s;oliciting our no|tice; they force them&s;elves into our view; they affect us &s;trongly. By the&s;e means they are very apt to render us regardle&s;s of &s;piritual and eternal things, which can be perceived only by faith, which make but a weak impre&s;&s;ion on the thoughtle&s;s, which cannot influence our conduct, except we &s;et our&s;elves voluntarily and de&s;ignedly to meditate upon them. While we are intent on our occupations for the &s;up|port of the animal life, we may very readily fall into neglect with re&s;pect to that occupa|tion which belongs to us as rea&s;onable and im|mortal creatures. We &s;hould guard again&s;t this with a care proportioned to the danger of our becoming guilty of it.</P>
<P>THE &s;cripture perpetually inculcates upon us, that the eternal happine&s;s of our &s;ouls, and the practice of holine&s;s by which it is &s;ecured, ought to be our principal concern, and to en|gage us more earne&s;tly than any of the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions
<PB N="3" REF="10">
and enjoyments which can profit us only in the pre&s;ent life, or any of tho&s;e worldly employments which are &s;ub&s;ervient to the attainment of them. The lea&s;t reflection is &s;ufficient to convince us of the propriety and the importance of this conduct. To tho&s;e who at all think &s;eriou&s;ly, the difficulty lies only in <HI>pre&s;erving</HI> a commanding impre&s;&s;ion of the nece&s;&s;ity of this conduct, and putting it in practice, amid&s;t the bu&s;y &s;cenes and the diffi|pations of common life. The&s;e frequently obliterate the conviction, and efface the &s;enti|ments, which are produced by the mo&s;t affect|ing repre&s;entations of the &s;uperior value of &s;piritual and eternal things, exhibited in an hour of retirement and devotion.</P>
<P>IT is of great moment, therefore, to acquire a &s;triking &s;en&s;e of the manner in which a con|cern for the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls, and appli|cation to the duties of religion, may be inter|mingled with our whole worldly employment, and exerted in the various circum&s;tances of or|dinary life. For di&s;cour&s;ing on this &s;ubject, we may naturally take occa&s;ion from the words now read; <HI>I will walk,</HI> &s;ays David, <HI>before the Lord in the land of the living.</HI> To <HI>walk before the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xvii. 1. xxiv. 40. xlviii. 15. 1 Kings iii. 6. 2 Kings xx. 3 Pro. lv. 13.</NOTE>, and, To <HI>walk with the</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="11">
<HI>Lord</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. v. 22. 24. vi. 9. Mich. vi. 8. Mal. ii. 6.</NOTE>, are beautiful expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed in &s;crip|ture, on purpo&s;e to convey this very view of religion: and the former of them conveys it the more explicitly in this place, by the p&s;almi&s;t's having added, <HI>in the land of the living.</HI> By the&s;e la&s;t words he no doubt de|&s;igned to expre&s;s the con&s;tancy of that obe|dience to God, which he promi&s;ed in return for the mercies acknowledged in this p&s;alm; he meant to intimate that he would per&s;i&s;t in it to the end of his life: but they likewi&s;e na|turally imply, that he would incorporate his religion with his whole ordinary life, and make it to run through all the occupations in which he might ever be employed in common with other men, and to blend it&s;elf with all the tran&s;actions relative to the pre&s;ent world, in which he might be at any time engaged. It is certain that the &s;criptures always &s;uppo&s;e religion to be connected with common life, and de&s;igned for influencing us in all the affairs of it: they never repre&s;ent it as a thing which may be laid a&s;ide when we come into the world, or for which we have no occa&s;ion while we are bu&s;ied in the labour of our &s;tations.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="12">TO con&s;ider religion in this important point of view, as what ought to mix with all our &s;ecular employments, and give a tincture and complection to all tho&s;e actions which have the mo&s;t intimate relation to the pre&s;ent ani|mal life, is what I now propo&s;e.</P>
<P>BY &s;etting religion in this light, I do not mean to affirm, that it contains no duties di&s;|tinct from the right conduct of our ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, or that there are no exerci&s;es belong|ing to it, which are ab&s;tracted from common life. There are times and &s;ea&s;ons appropriated to particular religious duties, into which no concern about our ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be allowed to intrude. There are a&s;&s;emblies called together for partaking in the &s;acraments, for public wor&s;hip, and for hearing the word, where we mu&s;t be intent on the&s;e exerci&s;es alone, and whence we mu&s;t exclude all worldly thoughts and cares. There are exerci&s;es of devotion which mu&s;t be performed in the &s;e|cre&s;y and &s;tillne&s;s of retirement; prayer, the reading of the &s;criptures, meditation on the principles of religion and the obligations of our &s;everal duties, &s;elf-examination, confe&s;&s;ion of our &s;ins, and re&s;olutions of amendment. We are not truly religious, if we allow concern for our temporal intere&s;ts and diligence in our worldly bu&s;ine&s;s to lead us into the neglect
<PB N="6" REF="13">
of the&s;e. They have not an immediate rela|tion to the employments of our &s;tations, but they are con&s;i&s;tent with them: they &s;u&s;pend them for a little, but they can be performed without any inconvenient interruption of them. The&s;e duties of religion enter not directly into common life, nor are intimately incorporated with its functions; they are rather in appear|ance ab&s;tracted from them: but they are in reality &s;ub&s;ervient to the right di&s;charge of them. They form impre&s;&s;ions which may influence us in life; they revive &s;entiments which, without them, the hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s would di&s;&s;ipate; they invigorate principles of conduct which the avocations of the world would enfeeble, but which the good man mu&s;t act upon every day. Without attendance on the&s;e duties of religion, we could have no good &s;entiments or principles to carry into the world with us: but we attend upon them to no purpo&s;e, if we carry not into the world with us, if we maintain not amid&s;t all the bu&s;tle of the world, the good &s;entiments and principles which they are fitted to infu&s;e. The church and the clo&s;et are the places where the&s;e duties are performed; but the world is the place where we mu&s;t di&s;play the effects which they produce, and exert the temper of holine&s;s which they cheri&s;h. The &s;piritual life mu&s;t be recruited by the exerci&s;es of re|tirement
<PB N="7" REF="14">
and retreat: but when it is recruited by the&s;e, as the nouri&s;hment adap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to it, it is in the world that it mu&s;t &s;hew its vigour: its functions mu&s;t mix them&s;elves with all tho&s;e of the animal life; our employment for eternity mu&s;t be interwoven with all our occu|pations for time.</P>
<P>IN the &s;equel I &s;hall, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> point out the importance of this view of religion; and, <HI>&s;e|condly,</HI> explain it.</P>
<P>FIRST, <HI>I &s;hall</HI> point out the importance of con&s;idering religion as connected with all the parts of our ordinary life.</P>
<P>THERE is no mi&s;take about the nature of religion more dangerous than an opinion that it is incon&s;i&s;tent, or even unconnected, with the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of life: this opinion will produce different effects on differ|ent per&s;ons; but all the effects which it can produce, will be pernicious.</P>
<P>IF it be entertained, it will infallibly lead the generality to neglect religion altogether. Pre&s;ent things are &s;o con&s;tantly in our view, the wants and the demands of the natural life are felt &s;o &s;trongly, that mo&s;t men will be ingro&s;&s;ed by them, if they apprehend that,
<PB N="8" REF="15">
without neglecting them, they cannot &s;ecure future and un&s;een things. Did all men per|ceive clearly, that they may <HI>walk with God</HI> while they are mixing in the &s;ocieties and employments of men, and that they may mo&s;t effectually promote their eternal happine&s;s while they are occupied in the bu&s;ine&s;s of their temporal vocations, many would endeavour to <HI>work out their &s;alvation</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. ii. 12.</NOTE>, who &s;carcely think of it, becau&s;e they imagine it unconnected with their ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, or incompatible with their worldly pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>SOME however have &s;o deep a &s;en&s;e of the importance of their eternal intere&s;ts, and &s;o &s;trong a &s;olicitude to &s;ecure them, that an opinion of their incon&s;i&s;tence with the bu&s;ine&s;s and pur&s;uits of life will drive them into the oppo&s;ite extreme. Under the influence of this mi&s;take many have &s;ecluded them&s;elves from the world, withdrawn from all the occupations of life, and given up them&s;elves to idlene&s;s, contemplation, and &s;olitary devotion. The life of &s;uch per&s;ons may be harmle&s;s, but it is u&s;ele&s;s: it may be freer from vice than the lives of others, but it is le&s;s virtuous; they have not been expo&s;ed to the &s;ame temptations with others; their innocence has in many ca&s;es
<PB N="9" REF="16">
ari&s;en only from their want of opportunity for committing &s;in, not from &s;trength of mind, or the vigour of virtuous principles. Were a life of monki&s;h indolence nece&s;&s;ary or con|ducive to the improvement and &s;alvation of our &s;ouls, God would not have placed us in a world where we have &s;o many wants that cannot be &s;atisfied without diligent application to a variety of occupations. An active and bu&s;y life is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with all that God requires of us, for plea&s;ing him or for obtaining eternal happine&s;s. Holine&s;s pre|&s;erved uncorrupted, and exerci&s;ed vigorou&s;ly, in active life, is much worthier than the in|offen&s;ive blamele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the mere reclu&s;e. You &s;hould yield your active &s;ervice unto God. You cannot plea&s;e him more effectually, than by following your &s;everal vocations, by en|gaging in the ordinary employments of life, by pur&s;uing them with indu&s;try, and being conver&s;ant about them in a right manner. You do not &s;erve God, you do not labour for eternity, you do not take care of your &s;ouls, only when you are meditating, or reading, or hearing, or praying, or partaking of the Lord's &s;upper; but al&s;o as effectually, though the&s;e pur|po&s;es be not perhaps &s;o directly in your thoughts when you are going about your worldly bu&s;ine&s;s in a virtuous manner, when you are hone&s;tly and con&s;cientiou&s;ly doing the work of your &s;tations.
<PB N="10" REF="17">
You may live to God, and yet live in the world. To renounce the world and fly to &s;o|litude, is to renounce the &s;tation which God has allotted us, and abandon the opportunities of doing good and becoming good, which he has given us.</P>
<P>MEN may entertain the mi&s;take of which we are &s;peaking, without running into either of the extremes now mentioned. They may regard religion as &s;omething wholly ab&s;tracted from life, and yet may engage in the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of life, without neglecting religion altogether. In this ca&s;e they will take up with a fal&s;e &s;pecies of religion: they will be concerned, perhaps anxiou&s;ly concerned, for their &s;alvation, but they will pur&s;ue it in an improper manner. They imagine that the &s;tate of their &s;ouls depends only on &s;ome for|mal tran&s;actions with God, on &s;ome &s;olitary and &s;ecret exertions of the will and the affec|tions in dedicating them&s;elves to him, and accepting of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and that it is no wi&s;e affected by the manner in which they carry on their ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s. They think that they may be religious, though they be immoral; that they may provide for eternity, though they neglect the duties of time; that they may be in a &s;tate of grace, though they be bad hu&s;bands, bad wives, unnatural parents,
<PB N="11" REF="18">
undutiful children, unfaithful &s;ervants, unkind and quarrel&s;ome neighbours, or di&s;hone&s;t dealers. They regard the graces of the &s;pirit as totally di&s;tinct from the moral virtues; the conduct which God approves, as perfectly different from that behaviour which is u&s;eful to mankind. They make an unnatural divorce between reli|gion and morality. In the place of true holi|ne&s;s they &s;ub&s;titute an ab&s;urd and unprofitable &s;uper&s;tition. Alas, my brethren, they deceive them&s;elves! If they act according to this idea, their religion will have no greater influ|ence upon their conduct, than if they made no pretences to religion; and therefore it will have no more influence upon their eternal &s;al|vation. Genuine religion is wholly practical: grace is but the principle of virtue and good works. Your religion can be of no value, I &s;hould rather &s;ay, you have no real religion, if it do not enter into life with you, if it do not pervade and animate all your actions.</P>
<P>A VERY great part of that conduct by which your eternal happine&s;s may be promoted, con&s;i&s;ts in tran&s;acting your ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s in a proper and virtuous manner. There is &s;carcely an action of your lives &s;o in&s;ignificant as not either to promote or to ob&s;truct your &s;alvation. The mo&s;t trivial and common actions may be performed right, or they
<PB N="12" REF="19">
may be performed wrong. We &s;hould all, therefore, maintain an uninterrupted care to perform all the actions of our lives aright. If we maintain this care, we &s;hall forward our everla&s;ting happine&s;s, by the very &s;ame actions by which we obtain or enjoy pre&s;ent things. Many of the common actions of life are far from being trivial or unimportant in a religious and moral view. It is by living in &s;ociety, and employing our&s;elves in the ordinary bu&s;i|ne&s;s of it, that we can find opportunity for many of our mo&s;t important duties, for many of the principal functions of the &s;piritual and chri&s;tian life: and by &s;eizing the&s;e opportu|nities, and u&s;ing them properly, we &s;hall mo&s;t effectually provide for eternity. It is from the ordinary occurrences of life, that we find oc|ca&s;ion for the principal exertions of tho&s;e vir|tues which regard either our&s;elves, our neigh|bour, or our God: and the&s;e virtues compre|hend the whole of our duty, and con&s;titute that holine&s;s which is the nece&s;&s;ary preparation for heaven.</P>
<P>THE ob&s;ervations which have been hitherto made, abundantly &s;hew the importance of that view of religion which I am endeavouring to give you; they likewi&s;e explain it in &s;ome mea&s;ure: for the more particular explication of it, which was the <HI>&s;econd</HI> thing propo&s;ed, let
<PB N="13" REF="20">
us briefly point out, how the <HI>three</HI> great branches of our duty now mentioned, inter|weave them&s;elves with the ordinary actions and employments of life.</P>
<P>1. THERE are many duties which we owe properly to our&s;elves, for practi&s;ing which we find the opportunity in the cour&s;e of ordinary life.</P>
<P>As long as we dwell in the&s;e earthly taber|nacles, &s;ome fore&s;ight and diligence about the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of the pre&s;ent life, is unavoidable. God doth not forbid it: he hath not made it incon&s;i&s;tent with the pur&s;uit of future happine&s;s. None would wi&s;h to &s;tarve or to be naked: God doth not require you to court the&s;e hard&s;hips. You may be diligent; you ought to be diligent in your callings: God not only allows, but commands you to be dili|gent; <HI>not &s;lothful in bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 11.</NOTE>, is a precept of divine authority; there are many &s;imilar pre|cepts: God promi&s;es his ble&s;&s;ing to diligence, and gives frequent encouragement to it. That man &s;ins, and ob&s;tructs his own progre&s;s to heaven, who is idle in his &s;tation. Religion renders indu&s;try a duty towards our&s;elves, en|forced by the authority of God: by reflecting
<PB N="14" REF="21">
on this obligation to it, and allowing it to have &s;ome influence upon us, we &s;hall convert every exertion of indu&s;try in our trade or pro|fe&s;&s;ion into an act of obedience to God: and if, while we are prompted to indu&s;try by the in|&s;tincts and pro&s;pects of the animal life, com|mon to all men, we be al&s;o impelled to it by a regard to the commandment of God, this additional motive cannot fail to quicken our indu&s;try, to increa&s;e it, and to render it more &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>GOD requires that the immediate objects of your indu&s;try &s;hould not engro&s;s your whole hearts; that you &s;hould not imagine the attain|ment of them &s;ufficient to make you happy; that amid&s;t your labour for them you &s;hould maintain a &s;en&s;e that there are things of in|finitely greater con&s;equence, to be either ob|tained or lo&s;t. Religion requires you to carry the&s;e &s;entiments through life with you: they will not enfeeble your indu&s;try, they will only re&s;train it from forced and unnatural ex|ertions; they will be no hindrance to its regu|lar and healthful motions, they will only pre|vent its running into di&s;torted and convul&s;ive agitations; they will not de&s;troy that eagerne&s;s which gives &s;pirit and per&s;erverance to your endeavours, they will only extingui&s;h that anxiety, &s;olicitude, and carefulne&s;s, which,
<PB N="15" REF="22">
while they make you neglect eternal things, often render you at the &s;ame time incapable of pur&s;uing pre&s;ent things in the mo&s;t effectual manner, and create immediate vexation of &s;pirit, for which no &s;ucce&s;s can make amends. In a word, &s;uch &s;entiments carried through life, and acted upon, will only &s;anctify your in|du&s;try, and render it conducive to your future happine&s;s, while it continues as &s;ub&s;ervient as ever, or even becomes more &s;ub&s;ervient to your pre&s;ent intere&s;t.</P>
<P>WE are &s;o formed as to be capable of enjoy|ment in tho&s;e earthly things which we po&s;&s;e&s;s. God doth not contradict our con&s;titution by his laws; he doth not require us to become in&s;en|&s;ible even to the lowe&s;t plea&s;ures. All men eat and drink: they are among the mo&s;t com|mon actions of your lives; yet religion is con|cerned in them. If, in eating and drinking&punc; you are luxurious, intemperate, or debauched, you &s;wallow down poi&s;on to your immortal &s;ouls: but if you eat and drink temperately and in moderation, without overvaluing or re|pining for the plea&s;ures which you have not, or abu&s;ing tho&s;e which you have, avoiding &s;en&s;uality and exce&s;s; if you eat and drink in that degree which promotes the health and &s;trength of the body, which renders it fitter for the &s;ervice of the &s;oul, which is decent,

<P>IT is a duty which we owe to our&s;elves, to pre&s;erve &s;obriety of mind, compo&s;ure of &s;pirit, a freedom from all violent pa&s;&s;ions, humility, and &s;elf-government. It is in the ordinary employments of life that we find both temptations to violate this temper, and occa|&s;ions for exerci&s;ing it: it is only by maintain|ing it amid&s;t all the occurrences of common life, and all the calls, and vici&s;&s;itudes, and tumults of bu&s;ine&s;s, that we can obey tho&s;e divine precepts which enjoin it. You are engaged in the pur&s;uit of &s;ome con&s;iderable advantage: you have now an opportunity of curbing the violence of your de&s;ires, of keep|ing them from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing your whole &s;ould: this is incumbent on you, and by this you &s;hall prepare your&s;elves for that happy &s;tate which excludes every ungoverned pa&s;&s;ion. In the cour&s;e of your occupations you meet with unexpected incidents, &s;udden turns, per|plexities, and intricacies: you are called to avoid being di&s;compo&s;ed by them; this will be a preparation for the &s;uperior regions of per|fect

&s;erenity and peace, at the &s;ame time that it prevents pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s, and even fits you for the mo&s;t proper management of your world|ly bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>IN this world, objects frequently occur which tend to draw us off from the path of life. They meet us in the &s;cenes of bu&s;ine&s;s, and in the hours of relaxation and amu&s;ement, in company, in &s;olitude, in every &s;ituation. Continual circum&s;pection and watchfulne&s;s again&s;t their drawing us into the ways of death, by &s;educing us into &s;in, is a duty which we owe to our own &s;ouls: and it is a duty which we mu&s;t put in practice every day, and every hour, in every place, and in every condition. We mu&s;t carry this temper through life with us, we mu&s;t pre&s;erve and exerci&s;e it in all the various circum&s;tances in which at any time we &s;tand, el&s;e we cannot per&s;i&s;t &s;tedfa&s;tly in the narrow way that leads to heaven.</P>
<P>2. IN like manner, in the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of our lives we &s;hall find the mo&s;t frequent and the be&s;t opportunities of performing our &s;everal duties to our fellow-men. Religion re|quires us to embrace the&s;e opportunities: and by embracing them, and performing the duties &s;uitable to them, we &s;hall &s;erve God, and
<PB N="18" REF="25">
plea&s;e him, and contribute to the &s;alvation of our own &s;ouls.</P>
<P>YOU &s;pend the day in merchandize, in la|bour, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of your calling whatever it is: you mu&s;t carry your religion along with you; you mu&s;t exerci&s;e it all the time you are thus employed. You may do your work either hone&s;tly and uprightly, or the contrary. If you deceive tho&s;e with whom you have deal|ings, or defraud them, or injure them, you injure your own &s;ouls much more, you move a &s;tep forward to de&s;truction. But if in every part of your bu&s;ine&s;s without exception, you act ju&s;tly and equitably, and deal with inte|grity and faithfulne&s;s; you <HI>walk before the Lord,</HI> while you &s;eem to be only bu&s;y in your worldly calling; you advance in your journey towards heaven, while you &s;eem to be only going round in the circle of employments which belong to this mortal &s;tate. The &s;hop, the exchange, the occupations of active life, form the only theatre on which the virtues of ju&s;tice, fidelity, and hone&s;ty can be practi&s;ed; and without con&s;tantly practi&s;ing the&s;e, you can have no religion. The&s;e virtues tend to &s;ecure the confidence of men, and to promote your worldly pro&s;perity; and by the uniform practice of them, you likewi&s;e <HI>lay up for your&s;elves trea&s;ures in heaven, where neither</HI>

<P>IN the train of life, in the intercour&s;e of &s;ociety and bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ome per&s;on does you un|de&s;igned harm, or an intended injury. This is the time when you have it in your power to exerci&s;e, and by exerci&s;ing to improve, pa|tience, meekne&s;s, forbearance, forgivene&s;s, kindne&s;s. It is only by exerci&s;ing them in &s;uch circum&s;tances, by making them to run through all the actions to which &s;uch circum|&s;tances give occa&s;ion, that you can &s;hew your|&s;elves to <HI>be the children of the Highe&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke vi. 35.</NOTE>, and heirs of the kingdom of life. If, on the occa|&s;ions mentioned, you, on the contrary, indulge bitterne&s;s, anger, wrath, malice, revenge; if you give way to the expre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e di&s;|po&s;itions in the communications of company, or the connexions of bu&s;ine&s;s; you &s;how your|&s;elves alienated from the gentle &s;pirit of true religion, and you render your&s;elves fit for the &s;ociety of tho&s;e fallen angels in whom male|volent pa&s;&s;ions reign.</P>

in which you are called to make candid and favourable con&s;tructions, to vindicate a&s;per&s;ed innocence, to clear up mi&s;con&s;tructed virtues, to agologize for exaggerated failings, to <HI>&s;peak the truth in love</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 15.</NOTE>. You have opportunity for the&s;e duties every day: it is in the relaxations of &s;ociety, in the turns of common conver&s;a|tion, that you find the opportunity; and they are e&s;&s;ential and important duties of religion. If in&s;tead of performing them, you, in your gaye&s;t meetings, and mo&s;t unre&s;erved talk, defame, &s;lander, revile, or backbite, you need make no preten&s;ions to true religion in your clo&s;ets or at church. <HI>If any man among you,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle James, <HI>&s;eem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jam. i. 26.</NOTE>.

<P>IN the cour&s;e of your employments, by the events which ca&s;t up in the train of your or|dinary bu&s;ine&s;s, you have opportunities of re|turning good to your benefactors, of doing

<P>I CANNOT mention particularly all the ways in which true holine&s;s will enter into &s;ocial life, and exert it&s;elf towards others, in all the varied &s;cenes and complicated &s;ituations which turn up in the cour&s;e of ordinary bu&s;i|ne&s;s. In addition to the in&s;tances already given, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve in general, that every act of proper behaviour which we &s;how as parents, as children, as ma&s;ters, as &s;er|vants,

<HEAD>SERMON II. RELIGION INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH ORDINARY LIFE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM cxvi. 9.</BIBL>
<Q>I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>RELIGION con&s;idered in its ju&s;t extent, contains two &s;orts of duties, the duties of piety, and tho&s;e which regard the actions of the natural and &s;ocial life. Both are e&s;&s;ential to it. But men &s;how a &s;trong propen&s;ity to con&s;ider the former as unconnected with life, and the latter as unconnected with religion, and by a mi&s;conception of both &s;orts equally, though in different re&s;pects, to di&s;unite religion from the occupations of common life. It pro|ceeds from a partial view of both the&s;e; and it tends to render our practice of both defective.</P>
<P>MEN confine their idea of piety to the acts of immediate wor&s;hip; they con&s;ider it not as what &s;hould, as what can enter into common
<PB N="24" REF="31">
life; they think that they &s;erve God, only when they are wor&s;hipping him, and di&s;en|gaged from their worldly employments. Con|ceiving religion in &s;o fal&s;e and contracted a light, they nece&s;&s;arily regard the actions of the natural and &s;ocial life, as without the verge of religion, as not requiring or admitting any regulation or direction from its influence.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of the&s;e partial and imper|fect conceptions, &s;ome have withdrawn from the bu&s;ine&s;s of life, that they might give up them&s;elves wholly to devotion, or have be|come negligent in their lawful calling, as inter|rupting their application to religion; and many more, intent on their worldly employments and intere&s;ts, and regarding all acts of devotion as encroaching upon the&s;e, neglect them to|tally, or croud them into as little time as po&s;|&s;ible: <HI>God is not in all their thoughts</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. x. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PERSONS of a &s;erious turn, and &s;en&s;ible of the importance of piety, will apply to what they con&s;ider as belonging to it. But if they imagine acts of immediate wor&s;hip to be all that belongs to it, their application will be of little value. They will be punctual in per|forming the&s;e: but they will think that when they have performed the&s;e, they have done all
<PB N="25" REF="32">
that piety requires, and are abundantly reli|gious; and too often they imagine that, if they &s;pend &s;ome hours of the day in devotion, they may do, through the re&s;t of it, whatever they plea&s;e, whatever their vicious pa&s;&s;ions prompt them to; at lea&s;t they are not &s;uffi|ciently careful to avoid doing &s;o. Thus their religion becomes a mere round of external &s;er|vices, attended perhaps with tran&s;ient and un|meaning emotions of &s;oul, but not a prepara|tion for the right conduct of life; and they bear in them&s;elves that character of corruption, which the apo&s;tle a&s;&s;igns to the men of the la&s;t days, <HI>having a form of godline&s;s, but denying the power thereof</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 Tim. iii. 5</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHETHER men have a regard to religion, or have not, if the actions of the natural and &s;ocial life be con&s;idered as without the pro|vince of religion, the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence will be, that men &s;hall think them&s;elves at li|berty to perform them, not according to the rules of religion. Whenever we look upon the ordinary actions of common life as indif|ferent, whenever we forget that there is either virtue or vice in almo&s;t every one of them, we are in great danger of indulging vice and contracting guilt in the performance of them. Whenever we allow our&s;elves to imagine that
<PB N="26" REF="33">
the&s;e actions have no influence on our &s;alvation, we &s;hall be ready to do them in &s;uch a man|ner as mu&s;t ob&s;truct our &s;alvation.</P>
<P>OF the three cla&s;&s;es of duties which are in|cumbent upon us, tho&s;e which regard our|&s;elves, and tho&s;e which regard other men, are too often con&s;idered as little connected with religion, and are, for that rea&s;on, reckoned &s;uch as may be in &s;ome mea&s;ure neglected without great danger to our &s;alvation. I have therefore &s;hown that our habitual behaviour, both towards our&s;elves and towards others, in the various &s;ituations of common life, nece&s;&s;a|rily implies good or evil, and promotes or ob|&s;tructs our everla&s;ting happine&s;s. The other cla&s;s of duties, tho&s;e which regard God, and are comprehended under the name of piety, are, on the contrary, often con&s;idered as un|connected with the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of life. In oppo&s;ition to this mi&s;take, I now proceed to &s;how, That we mu&s;t carry piety along with us through the whole cour&s;e of our lives, that we mu&s;t exerci&s;e godline&s;s in all our occupa|tions; el&s;e we can have no true religion, nor be fit for the enjoyment of God in heaven.</P>
<P>WE may acquire &s;ome lively impre&s;&s;ions of God, in retirement, or in the ordinances of wor&s;hip; but if the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions do not re|main
<PB N="27" REF="34">
with us and actuate us, when we enter into the world, and all the time we are con|ver&s;ant in the world, they are of no moment. Religious affections may be nouri&s;hed in the retreats of devotion, as a child is fed within doors: but it is in the open air, and by the bu&s;tle of exerci&s;e, that the child acquires and &s;hows health, vigour, and agility; and it is in the field of the world, and by being intro|duced into its &s;everal occupations, that the re|ligious affections obtain and di&s;play &s;trength, firmne&s;s, and energy. It is in the world they are put to the trial, it is there we find oppor|tunities for exerting them, and it is by being exerted there that they are improved into a commanding temper of piety.</P>
<P>THERE is no &s;ituation in life, which gives not &s;cope for &s;ome exerci&s;e of godline&s;s, and which requires it not, if we would not be wanting to our duty. Piety or a regard to God, is a vital &s;pirit which may run through, and ought to run through, all the virtues which re&s;pect either our&s;elves or others, to animate, to model, and direct them. It is not excluded from any place or condition which admits any virtue whatever; it cannot be di&s;|pen&s;ed with from any &s;uch place or condition, but that virtue lo&s;es much of its lu&s;tre, and is even in danger of peri&s;hing.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="35">LOVE to God is an affection which does not &s;pend it&s;elf in &s;ilent admiration, or warm feelings: it is fit to enter into life, and to act in life. We are commanded to KEEP our|&s;elves <HI>in the love of God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jude, ver. 21.</NOTE>: it is a temper which may po&s;&s;e&s;s us as con&s;tantly, and influence us as regularly, as affection to a parent or a friend. It &s;hould influence us through life, in the whole of our behaviour, in a manner &s;imilar to that in which affection to a parent or a friend, operates on &s;uch parts of our behaviour as have a re&s;pect to them. Love to God does not di&s;play it&s;elf &s;o much, or a&s;certain its &s;in|cerity and ardour &s;o unexceptionably, by any emotions inwardly felt, or by any raptures of devotion, as by its effects upon our actions; by making us delight to obey and plea&s;e God in every part of our behaviour; by making us willing to relinqui&s;h what we mo&s;t fondly de|&s;ire, or to incur what we mo&s;t vehemently dread, rather than offend him in committing any &s;in, or neglecting any duty; by alluring us to the imitation of all tho&s;e moral attri|butes which render God the object of our love; and by cheri&s;hing benevolence, and drawing out beneficence to all men, who are the chil|dren of our Father in heaven. Love to God will find opportunities for &s;ome of the&s;e exer|ci&s;es
<PB N="29" REF="36">
of it, in all our worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, in all the actions and events of common life: and if any man neglect the&s;e exerci&s;es of it, whenever he finds opportunity for them, <HI>how dwelleth the love of God in him</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 17.</NOTE>? His heart is void of it, though liveline&s;s of imagination or a con&s;ti|tutional warmth of affection may lead him to pre&s;ume that his love to God is ardent.</P>
<P>REVERENCE of God is not more analogous to the love of God, in it&s;elf, than in its ef|fects upon our ordinary conduct. It is not exerci&s;ed only when we &s;et our&s;elves to con|template and celebrate his greatne&s;s: we may be, and we ought to be, <HI>in the fear of the Lord all the day long</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiii. 17.</NOTE>. If we have any reverence of God, it will &s;how it&s;elf every hour in our mo&s;t common behaviour; in the &s;hade of &s;olitude, amid&s;t the temptations of &s;ociety, the cares of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the relaxation of amu&s;ements, in every &s;ituation, it will make us to <HI>&s;tand in awe, and not &s;in</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. iv. 4.</NOTE>; it will prompt us to act in a manner worthy of the pre&s;ence, the maje&s;ty, and the perfections of God.</P>
<P>GRATITUDE is due to God for the ble&s;&s;ings which we receive from him. The events of ordinary life furni&s;h us with con&s;tant &s;ubjects
<PB N="30" REF="37">
of gratitude. You eat your daily food; you find your&s;elves in health; you receive the price of your labour; you obtain &s;omething which you de&s;ired; you pro&s;per in your way: your duty in all the&s;e &s;ituations, the apo&s;tle Paul points out, <HI>In every thing give thanks; be grateful, for this is the will of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, concerning you</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. v. 18.</NOTE>. The exerci&s;e of grati|tude is not confined to profe&s;&s;ed acknowledg|ments of the mercies which we have received, in prai&s;e and thank&s;giving, in private or pub|lic devotion. The world al&s;o is a field for the exerci&s;e of gratitude. It is exerci&s;ed when|ever it implants in the heart a new motive to ab&s;tinence from &s;in and hatred of it, whenever it warms the &s;oul with additional alacrity in doing good, and makes us take greater plea&s;ure in it. The&s;e exerci&s;es of gratitude &s;hould be diffu&s;ed through life, as much as the ble&s;&s;ings are, which demand our gratitude; they &s;hould influence us as often as we are engaged in any action which can imply either good or evil: and what one action of our lives does not im|ply them?</P>
<P>COMMON life is the acknowledged &s;phere of re&s;ignation to the will of God. Piety exerting it&s;elf in re&s;ignation, is the proper root, and
<PB N="31" REF="38">
the only firm &s;upport of many of tho&s;e duties to our&s;elves, the operation of which through the occurrences of common life, either has been already delineated, or may ea&s;ily be traced; compo&s;ure, for in&s;tance, amid&s;t the tumults and fluctuations of the world, tranquillity in the uncertainty of its pro&s;pects, contentment and &s;elf-enjoyment under its di&s;appointments, fortitude in the view of its dangers. If the&s;e virtues are nipt off from piety, they become puny, and wither, and die. They mu&s;t be practi&s;ed through life; but they cannot be practi&s;ed except the exertions of a pious tem|per be twi&s;ted, as it were, with all the acts of them, to give them &s;trength. All the events of life, are uncertain; we are often in adver|&s;ity, our favourite de&s;igns are di&s;appointed, our deare&s;t comforts are taken from us, we be|come intere&s;ted about trifles, and they fail us: we cannot perform the duties which we owe to our&s;elves in the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, without deriving aid from piety. The&s;e are the &s;ea&s;ons which de|mand the practice of re&s;ignation, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and tru&s;t in God: the&s;e are the &s;ea&s;ons in which we mu&s;t put forth all our &s;trength to retain and exerci&s;e the&s;e pious principles, el&s;e we &s;hall fall into the &s;ins of peevi&s;hne&s;s, di&s;|content, repining, murmuring, anxiety, and &s;olicitude.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="39">PIETY requires &s;ubjection to the authority of God, as well as &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his providence. A &s;en&s;e of his authority will produce a con&s;tant di&s;po&s;ition to obey his laws. But his laws are nothing el&s;e but rules for the particulars of our behaviour in all the various circum&s;tances of human life: there is not a &s;ituation in which we can be placed, that is without the verge of their direction; there is not a &s;ituation in which our conduct will not be affected by our having a regard to God's &s;upreme authority, or by our failing in that regard.</P>
<P>GOD is not an unconcerned &s;pectator of the behaviour of rea&s;onable beings; he trieth their hearts, he weigheth all their actions, he approveth, or he di&s;approveth them. A &s;en&s;e of this, a prevailing re&s;pect to his judgment, a contempt of the opinions of all the world when oppo&s;ed to it, is an important part of piety, and a part of it for exerci&s;ing which the &s;tate of this world gives continual opportunity. In this world, we &s;ee vice practi&s;ed, and hear it ju&s;tified; we find virtue neglected, and even turned into ridicule: the immediate plea&s;ures and advantages of &s;in di&s;gui&s;e its horrors; the the pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;&s;es and inconveniencies to which virtue &s;ometimes expo&s;es men, eclip&s;e its beauty; corrupt fa&s;hion &s;eems to alter the mea|&s;ures of right and wrong behaviour; the promi&s;|cuous

<P>IN a word, all the affections which belong to a temper of piety, unite their force to re&s;train us from doing evil, and to excite us to do good, in all the varied &s;ituations of common life.

<P>THE go&s;pel having brought us acquainted with the Son of God, requires faith in him. Faith in Chri&s;t may be con&s;idered, either as a firm belief of what he has taught us, or as a dependence on his atonement and mediation
<PB N="36" REF="43">
for our acceptance with God, notwith&s;tanding the demerit of our &s;ins and the imperfection of our holine&s;s. Con&s;idered in both lights, faith is a principle fit to run through our whole lives, and to mix with all the mo&s;t ordinary actions of them.</P>
<P>ALL the truths which Chri&s;t hath taught us in the go&s;pel, are motives to the practice of holine&s;s; they are con&s;tantly propo&s;ed in &s;crip|ture, as incitements both to holine&s;s in general, and to the &s;everal particular virtues. The faith which the go&s;pel requires, is not a more <HI>a&s;&s;ent</HI> to the&s;e truths: it implies &s;uch a lively impre&s;&s;ion, and &s;uch a permanent &s;en&s;e of them, as may form our whole temper to holine&s;s, and influence all our actions. A temper of holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;trength of good affect|ions, and in purity from vicious pa&s;&s;ions: good affections are excited when their objects are brought into our view, and placed in a &s;trik|ing light; they are &s;trengthened when their objects are brought often into view, and atten|tively con&s;idered: the truths of religion &s;et the&s;e objects of good affections in the mo&s;t &s;triking lights, and a firm belief of the truths of religion keeps the&s;e objects con&s;tantly in our view, and fixes our attention upon them; and thus renders the good affections habitually prevalent in our hearts. It is this &s;ame belief
<PB N="37" REF="44">
likewi&s;e that pre&s;ents to our minds all tho&s;e con&s;iderations which tend to counteract vicious pa&s;&s;ions, and to purify us gradually from them. Every action proceeds from &s;ome motive, with|out which neither would the action be done, nor that affection which is its immediate prin|ciple be &s;upported: every good action proceeds from &s;ome religious motive, from &s;ome truth urging us to the practice of it; it is faith that &s;ugge&s;ts this motive, and it mu&s;t &s;ugge&s;t it in the moment in which the action is to be done. True faith keeps all the principles of religion, which can in any way influence our conduct, which can either re&s;train us from doing evil or prompt us to do good, in a continual rea|dine&s;s to occur to us, whenever we have occa|&s;ion for them. We have occa&s;ion for them in every &s;ituation in which we have occa&s;ion to act. Faith therefore mu&s;t attend us, and &s;ug|ge&s;t the principles of religion as motives to action, in every place, and in every one of our various occupations.

<P>FAITH con&s;idered as a dependence upon Chri&s;t, &s;eems not to mingle &s;o congenially with the ordinary actions of life: yet it is truly fit to mingle with them in a very great degree. Whenever we reflect that we have committed any &s;in, and feel remor&s;e for it, (and, in the pre&s;ent frail &s;tate of man, how often mu&s;t this happen to every &s;en&s;ible heart?) it is faith exerting it&s;elf in dependence upon Chri&s;t, that mitigates our &s;orrow, and re&s;tores our chearfulne&s;s.

from &s;inking beneath the &s;en&s;e of our imperfection and guilt. It is dependence upon Chri&s;t, that encourages us to amend what we know to be wrong in our&s;elves, and in our former conduct; for it is dependence upon him, that makes us to feel that it &s;hall not be in vain: and while we are imperfect creatures, a great part of right conduct mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in en|deavours to do the &s;everal actions of life better than we have done them in former in&s;tances. In general, hopes and fears of futurity not only ari&s;e in the hours of reflection, but often influence us in the actions of life; and in a Chri&s;tian, hope and fear can never be wholly &s;eparated from exerci&s;es of faith towards Je&s;us, who <HI>delivereth us from the wrath to come</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. i. 10.</NOTE>, and <HI>through</HI> whom <HI>eternal life is the gift of God</HI> to us <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE go&s;pel reveals to us the Holy Spirit al&s;o, and requires us to exerci&s;e dependence on the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he is &s;ent on purpo&s;e to impart. To be convinced that this dependence &s;hould run through our whole lives, and mingle with all our actions, and to under&s;tand how it may do &s;o, we need only recollect the end for which the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit is given. It is given for our &s;anctification; it is given to be a principle of purity, and virtue, and activity

in well-doing. Through the whole cour&s;e of our life, and in all its occupations, we have opportunities of avoiding evil and of doing good; and whenever we exert our&s;elves in either, it &s;hould be with dependence on the aids of the Divine Spirit. We &s;hould have an habitual tru&s;t in the&s;e, &s;imilar to that habitual &s;en&s;e which good men entertain of the de|pendence of their nature and all their powers upon God. If we have &s;uch tru&s;t, it will lead us, not only to recogni&s;e, at &s;tated times, the Holy Spirit as the author of our virtues, and to pray to God for his aids; but al&s;o to look up to him in the very moment of action, and, by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;ence and &s;upport of &s;o powerful an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, to invigo|rate our&s;elves in every hour of languor, and to encourage our&s;elves in every moment of temp|tation and difficulty, that we may, without wearine&s;s or intermi&s;&s;ion, put forth all the &s;trength which he imparts to us, in re&s;i&s;ting all the attacks of &s;in, and practi&s;ing every vir|tue, as we find the opportunity. It is this habitual and active improvement of the divine aids, that the apo&s;tle recommends to the Ga|latians; <HI>This I &s;ay then, Walk in the Spirit</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 16.</NOTE>: the expre&s;&s;ion implies, that we &s;hould have the whole tenour of our ordinary behaviour regulated by the influence of the Spirit of God.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="48">THUS I have endeavoured to repre&s;ent re|ligion to you, in its connexion with ordinary life. I have &s;hown the importance of this view of it; and I have explained it, by point|ing out the opportunities which ordinary life affords for the practice of religion, and by tracing the influence of religion on our beha|viour in the&s;e &s;everal opportunities. Religion con&s;i&s;ts not in our withdrawing from the oc|cupations of the pre&s;ent world, but in our being conver&s;ant in them after a virtuous man|ner. The apo&s;tle Paul, in de&s;cribing that goodne&s;s which the go&s;pel was revealed on pur|po&s;e to enforce, reduces it to the three heads of virtue which we have now illu&s;trated, <HI>that we live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly,</HI> and he adds, <HI>in this pre&s;ent world</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 12.</NOTE>: the addition is not vain, it &s;ugge&s;ts the very idea which I have made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to unfold; it inti|mates that we have no religion, no Chri&s;tianity, if we do not carry it into the world with us, and exerci&s;e it in all the circum&s;tances of life. The apo&s;tle James gives us the &s;ame view of religion, though in a different manner of ex|pre&s;&s;ion; <HI>Pure religion and undefiled before God even the Father, is this, To vi&s;it the fatherle&s;s and the widow in their affliction, and to keep him&s;elf un&s;potted from the world</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jam. i. 27.</NOTE>: the world
<PB N="42" REF="49">
contains temptations to vice, and it pre|&s;ents opportunities of doing good in all the ways of virtuous exertion; both occur at all times and in all conditions; and pure religion con&s;i&s;ts in guarding again&s;t the former, and embracing and improving the latter, when|ever they occur. When our Saviour was mo&s;t &s;olicitous for the happine&s;s of his di&s;ciples; when he had the mo&s;t immediate view of the dangers to which they were expo&s;ed in a world that <HI>hated them,</HI> as it had <HI>before hated him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xvii. 14.</NOTE>, when he declared that they were <HI>not of the world</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 16.</NOTE>; even then he &s;aid to his Father, <HI>I pray not that thou &s;hould&s;t take them out of the world, but that thou &s;hould&s;t keep them from the evil</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 15.</NOTE>. It was by being &s;ent forth into the world, and acting in it, that they could be u&s;eful, and that they could become happy.</P>
<P>THE example of our Saviour, as well as the intimations of &s;cripture, &s;ets religion in this point of view. Through all the early part of his life, he laboured in Jo&s;eph's vo|cation, as a carpenter: he left it not till the &s;ea&s;on came when he was called to enter on another vocation, incon&s;i&s;tent with it, and which required all his time. Even after that, he &s;till lived in the world, mixed in &s;ociety,
<PB N="43" REF="50">
conver&s;ed with men, <HI>was in all points tempted like as we are</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. ii. 20.</NOTE>; and in this &s;ituation continued to be <HI>without &s;in</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. iv. 16.</NOTE>, exhibited an example of every virtue in perfection, and by that exam|ple &s;hewed mankind, in what manner reli|gion &s;hould exert it&s;elf in the &s;everal occur|rences of common life. It is for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, that the lives and actions of good men are recorded in &s;cripture; it is to let us &s;ee, how they exerci&s;ed their religion in the &s;cenes of action and in &s;ecular employment: and the wi&s;dom of God, by delivering a great part of the &s;cripture in the form of hi&s;tory, has provided for recording &s;o great a number and variety of examples, that in them we may ob&s;erve the operation of religion in al|mo&s;t every po&s;&s;ible condition and juncture of human life. If you be not religious and vir|tuous in active life, in whatever &s;tation you fill, in whatever occupation you follow, it is your own fault, not the fault of your &s;itua|tion: religion and virtue may be incorporated: with the bu&s;ine&s;s of every lawful calling; the&s;e have actually been incorporated together in the practice of many of your fellow-men. The &s;pirit of true religion, and the &s;pirit of worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, are not repugnant, like a drop of water and a drop of oil, which repel
<PB N="44" REF="51">
each other, and refu&s;e to mingle; they may be rendered like two drops of mercury, which run together and form one drop. The im|provement and happine&s;s of our &s;ouls is mo&s;t effectually promoted when all our worldly oc|cupations are rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to it: our pre&s;ent intere&s;ts will likewi&s;e be be&s;t &s;ecured when all our endeavours after them are regu|lated by religion and virtue.</P>
<P>WHEN the boundaries between religion and ordinary life are mi&s;placed, both mu&s;t be un|duly contracted. They are not like two ter|ritories &s;eparated by a preci&s;e limit, but like territories which, be&s;ides the parts that lie in this manner di&s;tinct, have many fields in common, or connected by mutual &s;ervitudes, &s;o that they can be cultivated and improved only by united efforts. It is &s;ometimes &s;aid, that God has re&s;erved the Lord's day for him|&s;elf and his &s;ervice, and that he has given us the other &s;ix days of the week for our&s;elves. This manner of &s;peaking is inaccurate, and has too much a tendency to di&s;gui&s;e the connexion between religion and common life. The Lord's day, God has in &s;ome &s;en&s;e re&s;erved peculiarly to him&s;elf; on it we ought to ab&s;tain from our worldly occupations: but its exerci&s;es are not unrelated to the&s;e occupations, they are de|&s;igned to prepare us for the right and virtu|ous
<PB N="45" REF="52">
management of them, and &s;hould be per|formed with this view. The other &s;ix days, God has allowed us for our worldly occupa|tions; but not exclu&s;ively of &s;erving him: for in the&s;e very occupations we ought to &s;erve God every hour of all the &s;ix days. We do &s;erve him in them, whenever we carry them on in a virtuous manner. By thus carrying them on, we promote our &s;alvation, though we &s;hould not at all times explicitly intend to promote it by them. But it will render our worldly occupations the more &s;ub&s;ervient to our &s;alvation, for it will contribute to our practi&s;ing them aright, that throughout the whole cour&s;e of them we pre&s;erve a &s;olicitude for our &s;alvation, and frequently exert actual de&s;ires of promoting it by means of the labours of our &s;tation. Thus &s;hall we be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an habitual good intention; thus &s;hall we ap|ply a good intention to our mo&s;t indifferent actions, and direct them all to laudable and worthy ends.</P>
<P>SOME have apologized for the multiplica|tion of ceremonies in religion, by a&s;&s;erting that this multiplies the opportunities of &s;erv|ing God, and the means of promoting our &s;alvation. The apology is frivolous: the ob|&s;ervance of ceremonies is neither &s;erving God nor a means of our &s;alvation, except the cere|monies
<PB N="46" REF="53">
be of divine appointment; and if they were, yet &s;till the multiplication of ceremo|nies, would multiply our dangers of neglect|ing his will and falling into &s;in, would in|crea&s;e the difficulty of religion, would render many things nece&s;&s;ary which might have been &s;afely omitted if God had not required them by po&s;itive precepts, and would thus prove a &s;nare to our &s;ouls. But the ordinary actions of life mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be done: and by &s;etting our|&s;elves to do them all with a regard to God, and with a view to the improvement and &s;al|vation of our &s;ouls, we &s;hall, without incur|ring any new danger or inconvenience, mul|tiply the means of our &s;alvation, increa&s;e the number of our virtues, and avoid many vices: we &s;hall render our whole exi&s;tence one con|tinued act of goodne&s;s, religion, and obedi|ence; and we &s;hall be, in all the &s;ituations and occurrences of life, plea&s;ing to him whom we are made to plea&s;e, and in plea&s;ing whom our happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>TO conclude, we are at pre&s;ent in a &s;tate of di&s;cipline for eternity: every event, every circum&s;tance of this &s;tate gives us opportunity for the practice of &s;ome virtue; and it is by acting virtuou&s;ly in every circum&s;tance of this &s;tate, that we can be improved in holine&s;s, and become fit for heaven. Our commone&s;t ac|tions
<PB N="47" REF="54">
are tho&s;e in which we think religion lea&s;t concerned, and on which we are apt to be&s;tow the lea&s;t attention: but of our com|mone&s;t actions we ought rather to take the greate&s;t care; for they are mo&s;t frequently re|peated; they will therefore form the &s;tronge&s;t habits; they will mo&s;t promote our improve|ment and our happine&s;s, if they be con&s;tantly performed right; but they will mo&s;t ob&s;truct it, if we indulge our&s;elves in a cu&s;tom of per|forming them wrong.</P>

<P>THE duties which are incumbent upon us, may be very properly divided into two cla&s;&s;es; &s;uch as are incumbent upon all men, and &s;uch as are incumbent upon parti|cular ranks of men.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome in&s;tances, the duties of the latter kind are totally di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the for|mer kind. Peculiar circum&s;tances in the &s;itu|ation of certain cla&s;&s;es of men, give them opportunities for the exerci&s;e of particular vir|tues, and the practice of particular duties, for which there is no &s;cope in other &s;ituations. Thus the duties of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion are incumbent only upon &s;ubjects, not at all upon the &s;u|preme
<PB N="50" REF="56">
magi&s;trates: and on the other hand, all the virtues which regard the exerci&s;e of civil authority, are peculiar to the rulers of nations; private per&s;ons have no opportunity of practi&s;|ing them.</P>
<P>BUT in mo&s;t ca&s;es, the duties of the man, and the duties of the man of a certain cha|racter, are in &s;ome mea&s;ure coincident. Our duties are always corre&s;pondent to our &s;itua|tions: but the &s;ituations of all men agree in many of the mo&s;t important particulars, and therefore give all men opportunities for the practice of many of the mo&s;t important duties. All the great in&s;tances of piety, charity, ju&s;tice, and temperance, are indi&s;pen&s;ibly incumbent on every one that is born of a woman, on the magi&s;trate and the &s;ubject, on the mini&s;ter and the people, on the high and the low, on the rich and the poor, on the old and the young. But &s;till the &s;ituation of every cla&s;s contains &s;ome peculiar circum&s;tances, which render &s;e|veral duties of univer&s;al obligation peculiarly incumbent on per&s;ons of that cla&s;s, either lay|ing them under &s;pecial obligations to them, or requiring particular exerci&s;es of them. Such duties may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as peculiar du|ties of that &s;tation which in this manner de|mands them. It were ea&s;y to multiply ex|amples: the text affords one. All men &s;hould

be ju&s;t; the obligation of ju&s;tice is ab&s;olutely indi&s;pen&s;ible; the violation of it expo&s;es a man to dete&s;tation and in&s;amy: yet even this virtue, who&s;e obligation is to all men &s;o &s;a|cred and inviolable, is declared to be peculiarly the duty of rulers: God had &s;aid to Mo&s;es, <HI>Judges and officers &s;halt thou make thee in all thy gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee throughout thy tribes;</HI> he had declared what &s;hould be their bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>They &s;hall judge the people with ju&s;t judgment:</HI> then addre&s;&s;ing each of them, as if they had been already appointed to the office, he cautions them again&s;t the common perver&s;ion of ju&s;tice, <HI>Thou &s;halt not wre&s;t judg|ment, thou &s;halt not re&s;pect per&s;ons, neither take a gift;</HI> and to intimate the great importance of ju&s;tice in their public character, he repeats the charge to practi&s;e it, in the text, <HI>That which is altogether ju&s;t &s;hall thou follow.</HI> In the original, the manner of expre&s;&s;ion is em|phatical, thou &s;halt practi&s;e &s;trict ju&s;tice, thou &s;halt practice ju&s;tice diligently, thou &s;halt practice ju&s;tice con&s;tantly.

<P>THE <HI>general</HI> duties of men are, for obvious rea&s;ons, the mo&s;t frequent &s;ubjects of di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit. But the practice of tho&s;e duties which are <HI>peculiarly</HI> incumbent on par|ticular cla&s;&s;es of men, is often of as great im|portance

to their own character and to the in|tere&s;ts of &s;ociety, and as nece&s;&s;ary for their ob|taining the approbation of God, as the practice of their general duties; and failures in what belongs to our di&s;tingui&s;hing rank and pro|fe&s;&s;ion, are as great blemi&s;hes, are attended with as pernicious con&s;equences, and will be as &s;everely puni&s;hed by God, as any other vices. They likewi&s;e are, on this account, very proper &s;ubjects of di&s;cour&s;e, e&s;pecially when &s;uitable occa&s;ions invite us to the con&s;ideration of them.

The pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, then, will give a propriety to our endeavouring to &s;hew, That &s;trict and inflexible ju&s;tice is peculiarly the virtue of all judges, magi&s;trates, and rulers, and to point out the rea&s;ons why this virtue con&s;titutes the immediate decorum of their character.</P>

<P>EVERY &s;tation, even the lowe&s;t, requires &s;ome peculiar duties from tho&s;e who occupy it; for every &s;tation contains &s;ome circum&s;tances peculiar to it&s;elf, and is de&s;igned to an&s;wer &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;e, which cannot be an&s;wer|ed without ob&s;erving certain congruous rules. The mechanic mu&s;t perform &s;ome things, not required from other men, in order to render his occupation as u&s;eful to &s;ociety as it ought to be. By failing to perform the&s;e things, he becomes faulty in his own trade. To be faulty in one's own trade, is, in the &s;en&s;e of every man, to be doubly faulty: but in the meaner profe&s;&s;ions, it does not engage our at|tention much, becau&s;e their ends are not of di|&s;tingui&s;hed importance.</P>
<P>THE higher employments, as well as the lower, are directly calculated for certain ends,
<PB N="54" REF="60">
to promote which certain virtues are peculiarly requi&s;ite. To fail in the exerci&s;e of the&s;e vir|tues defeats the very end of the office, and is incon&s;i&s;tent with its functions. The higher offices in &s;ociety are in&s;tituted for momentous ends; the defeating of the&s;e ends produces great and exten&s;ive mi&s;chiefs; and therefore the vices which defeat them, are, in men who hold the&s;e offices, regarded with &s;ingular ab|horrence. The dignity of the office, and the importance of its end, mix with our &s;enti|ments, excite a &s;en&s;e of ab&s;olute impropriety and indecency in the vices directly &s;ubver&s;ive of it, and make us con&s;ider the oppo&s;ite vir|tues in a peculiar point of view, with a parti|cular modification of our approbation, as con|&s;tituting the decorum of character in men of that profe&s;&s;ion. Every profe&s;&s;ion of public importance in &s;ociety, has a corre&s;pondent de|corum of character belonging to it; and this decorum always con&s;i&s;ts in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e virtues which are mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially nece&s;|&s;ary for the right exerci&s;e of that profe&s;&s;ion.

<P>OF all the virtues, ju&s;tice is the mo&s;t inti|mately nece&s;&s;ary for performing the functions,

and an&s;wering the end of the judge's office.&mdash;All virtue properly belongs to him: it becomes the man who is exalted above others by his rank, authority, or power, to be <HI>more excellent than his neighbour</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xii. 26.</NOTE>; and univer&s;al virtue is the true excellence of man. Every vice is ba&s;e, and introduces &s;ome degree of meanne&s;s into the character: but every &s;ort of meanne&s;s is un&s;uitable to tho&s;e per|&s;ons who&s;e rank in&s;pires re&s;pect, who&s;e autho|rity is the object of veneration, and cannot be &s;upported without properly affecting the opi|nions and &s;entiments of tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to it.&mdash;Many particular virtues are, in different re&s;pects, peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of the authority of rulers, and to the right per|formance of the duties of their &s;tation; and the oppo&s;ite vices ob&s;truct this end, and are, for that rea&s;on, un&s;eemly in the ruler.&mdash;Tem|perance, &s;elf-government, &s;edate recollection of &s;oul, correctne&s;s and dignity of conduct, be|come rulers; levity, di&s;&s;ipation, gaity, or gid|dine&s;s of demeanour, love of plea&s;ure, and every &s;en&s;ual exce&s;s, mi&s;become them: tho&s;e virtues are &s;uitable, and the&s;e vices perfectly un&s;uitable, to the elevation of their rank, to the gravity of their character, to the &s;olemnity of their office, to the intention and application of mind
<PB N="56" REF="62">
which it requires. The littlene&s;s of the&s;e vices, joined with the idea of men who repre|&s;ent the public, and ought to &s;u&s;tain its honour, forms an incongruous mixture, which is ne|ce&s;&s;arily ungraceful, and cannot fail to give di&s;gu&s;t to the &s;pectator.&mdash;In like manner, piety is a becoming ingredient in the character, and an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of the &s;tation of tho&s;e to whom any part of the government is com|mitted; and every kind and degree of impiety is unfit and unbecoming in them. They are the guardians of the peace and order of &s;ociety, and con&s;equently ought to be the guardians and and friends of religion, without which that peace and order cannot be pre&s;erved. Their rank will give force to an example of piety ex|hibited by them, and by rendering the practice of it more general among their inferiors, they will multiply tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which religion confers upon &s;ociety. Religion will be the mo&s;t powerful principle of that impartial and &s;teady ju&s;tice which &s;ociety has a right to ex|pect from its judges: an inward temper of fervent piety will &s;et God continually before them, in the very light in which the P&s;almi&s;t repre&s;ents him, <HI>&s;tanding in the congregation of the mighty, judging among the Gods,</HI> &s;aying to them, <HI>Judge not unju&s;tly, accept not the per&s;ons of the wicked; defend the poor and fatherle&s;s,</HI>

A &s;oul <HI>having covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. xviii. 21.</NOTE>, full of genero&s;ity, &s;uperior to all the allure|ments of riches, is nece&s;&s;ary for giving his character the proper elevation, for &s;ecuring him again&s;t all danger of corruption, and for e&s;ta|bli&s;hing a general confidence in his integrity.&mdash;But &s;till even the&s;e virtues are more <HI>indirectly</HI> &s;ub&s;ervient to the end of the judge's office, than ju&s;tice is. Other virtues promote that end by the intervention of &s;omething el&s;e, to which they contribute; ju&s;tice promotes it immedi|ately,
<PB N="58" REF="64">
without the intervention of any thing el&s;e. The exerci&s;e of ju&s;tice it&s;elf, is the proximate means of an&s;wering the purpo&s;es of government and judgment: one of the princi|pal ways in which other virtues promote the&s;e purpo&s;es, is, by &s;upporting or contributing to the &s;teady and vigorous exerci&s;e of incorrupt|ible ju&s;tice. Inju&s;tice, directly and of it&s;elf, defeats the&s;e purpo&s;es, and is in every in&s;tance ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with them: other vices ob&s;truct them, &s;ometimes very &s;trongly, but always more remotely and indirectly, often by preparing the way to inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>IN a word, magi&s;trates and judges are &s;et over men for this very end, to do judgment and ju&s;tiee; as their office is of divine appoint|ment, they are charged to pur&s;ue this end, by God him&s;elf; every deviation from ju&s;tice, is perfectly rever&s;ing the end of their appoint|ment: ju&s;tice is therefore their peculiar vir|tue, the immediate decorum of their charac|ter.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Rulers and judges have, from their office, opportunity for many exertions of ju&s;tice, wholly peculiar to them&s;elves. On this account al&s;o, ju&s;tice may be con&s;idered as in a &s;pecial manner the virtue of their charac|ter and &s;tation.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="65">EVERY private per&s;on has opportunity for many exertions of the virtue of ju&s;tice. All the parts of our intercour&s;e with others, give us opportunities for ab&s;taining from hurting them, for rendering every man his due in re|&s;pect of property, reputation, and honour, for performing promi&s;es, for executing faithfully what has been committed to our tru&s;t. The uniform practice of the&s;e &s;everal offices of ju&s;tice, entitles private per&s;ons to the cha|racter of ju&s;t and hone&s;t men: a failure in any one of them, would in &s;ome mea&s;ure forfeit that character.</P>
<P>RULERS have, in common with other men, opportunities for all the&s;e duties; for their connexions with mankind, by means of outward things, are the &s;ame with tho&s;e of other men. But the mo&s;t blamele&s;s practice of the&s;e duties, is not &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a ruler, a ju&s;t and righteous man. Many other exerci&s;es of ju&s;tice are as indi&s;pen&s;ibly incum|bent upon <HI>him,</HI> as any of the&s;e is upon <HI>other</HI> men. To him it belongs, to procure ju&s;tice for tho&s;e who cannot procure it to them&s;elves, to execute ju&s;tice between man and man, and between individuals and &s;ociety. The poor man, who cannot him&s;elf re&s;i&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion of the great, the peaceable man, who is har|ra&s;&s;ed by the encroachments of the man of

violence, the orphan, who&s;e rights are in|vaded by him that hath no bowels, claim the protection of the judge, and can obtain redre&s;s only by bringing their cau&s;e under his cogni|zance. Differences ari&s;ing from the ignorance or the &s;elf-partiality of per&s;ons well di&s;po&s;ed, can be determined only by the &s;uperior know|ledge and unbia&s;&s;ed ju&s;tice of the judge. When individuals are injured, or the public di&s;turbed, by crimes, it is to the integrity of the judge that they mu&s;t look up for help. It belongs to his office, to determine equally in every ca&s;e, to vindicate violated rights, to fru&s;trate unrighteous demands, to puni&s;h de|&s;tructive crimes. How exten&s;ive, then, is the &s;phere of <HI>public</HI> ju&s;tice, which is peculiar to the ruler and the judge? In every in&s;tance of public ju&s;tice, he mu&s;t make con&s;cience of doing what is right; el&s;e he forfeits the cha|racter of a ju&s;t and hone&s;t man, in the very &s;ame way as another per&s;on would forfeit it by being convicted of a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of private ju&s;tice. He mu&s;t be &s;uperior to all influence from the favour or di&s;plea&s;ure of men, and from every motive of intere&s;t: in his <HI>public</HI> character, he mu&s;t refu&s;e to feel, what it is amiable to feel and to comply with in <HI>private</HI> life, the &s;ugge&s;tions of natural affection, the attractions of blood, the tenderne&s;s of friend|&s;hip, the impul&s;e of gratitude, the emotions

of compa&s;&s;ion: he mu&s;t not allow either ad|miration of a per&s;on's general worth, or indig|nation again&s;t his habitual ba&s;ene&s;s, &s;entiments which in ordinary life it is glorious to cheri&s;h, to mingle with his decrees: the moment he is &s;eated on his tribunal, he mu&s;t <HI>know no man after the fle&s;h</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 16.</NOTE>, he mu&s;t ob&s;tinately ab&s;tain from con&s;idering any man in any other light, but that preci&s;e light in which he appears in the pre&s;ent cau&s;e. <HI>Ye &s;hall do</HI> NO <HI>unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s in judgment; thou &s;hall not re&s;pect the per|&s;on of the</HI> FOOR, <HI>nor honour the per&s;on of the</HI> MIGHTY: <HI>but in righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;halt thou judge thy neighbour</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lev. xix. 15.</NOTE>.

<P>THIRDLY, <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> may be con&s;idered as in a peculiar manner belonging to rulers, judges, and magi&s;trates, becau&s;e they are under pecu|liar obligations to it.</P>
<P>IT will be found on examination that our all-wi&s;e Creator has, in forming human nature, enforced every virtue by &s;anctions who&s;e &s;trength is preci&s;ely in proportion to the degree in which that virtue is nece&s;&s;ary to human life and &s;o|ciety.
<PB N="62" REF="68">
Ju&s;tice is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;afety of human life, and to the very exi&s;tence of &s;ociety; the univer&s;al violation of it would multiply po&s;itive pains and &s;ufferings upon mankind, and prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of their union. Accordingly the practice of ju&s;tice is &s;ecured by the mo&s;t powerful motives. It is one of tho&s;e virtues which con&s;cience makes us feel to be of &s;acred and inviolable obligation: the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of it by others, excites our abhorrence and dete&s;tation; the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a trangre&s;&s;ion of it by our&s;elves, produces remor&s;e and &s;elf-condemnation; in both ca&s;es our &s;entiments are attended with a &s;en&s;e of me|rited di&s;grace and puni&s;hment.&mdash;Different ex|erci&s;es of the &s;ame virtue are, in con&s;equence of this con&s;titution of our nature, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">elt to be more or le&s;s &s;trictly obligatory in proportion to the degree of their nece&s;&s;ity in human life. All men are indi&s;pen&s;ably bound to every act of ju&s;tice that comes within their &s;phere. But &s;ome exerci&s;es of ju&s;tice are more nece&s;&s;ary than others, and therefore of &s;tricter obligation. Not to perceive the &s;uperiority of their obliga|tion, not to condemn tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of them more &s;everely, not to abhor them more vio|lently, not to a&s;cribe to them more atrocious guilt and higher demerit, would demon&s;trate a perver&s;ion of our &s;entiments, a depravation of our con&s;cience.&mdash;The &s;ame virtues, and
<PB N="63" REF="69">
the &s;ame exerci&s;es of them, are more e&s;&s;ential to the &s;upport of &s;ociety, in &s;ome characters than in others: and it is a con&s;equence of the &s;tructure of our nature already pointed out, that on the former they are felt, by every un|corrupted heart, to be proportionably more &s;acredly obligatory.</P>
<P>THESE principles, which have a plain foundation in the con&s;titution of human na|ture, are &s;ufficient for evincing that magi&s;|trates and judges are under peculiar obligations to ju&s;tice. All inju&s;tice is de&s;tructive to &s;o|ciety; but it is far more de&s;tructive when it is practi&s;ed by rulers, than if it were practi&s;ed only by private per&s;ons. Ju&s;tice in all men is beneficial to &s;ociety, but in judges it is more beneficial.</P>
<P>EVERY act of inju&s;tice brings po&s;itive hurt on the per&s;on who is affected by it; but an un|ju&s;t judgment hurts with the cutting aggrava|tions of its being done under form of law, and of its impeaching the per&s;on whom it in|jures, as if he had been injurious. Private per&s;ons are connected only with a few, and therefore only a few can be hurt by their in|ju&s;tice; but the inju&s;tice of a judge is of more exten&s;ive con&s;equence, it hurts all who are &s;ubject to his juri&s;diction. Private inju&s;tice
<PB N="64" REF="70">
may be checked or redre&s;&s;ed by the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of the judge; but if the judge be un|righteous, by whom &s;hall his inju&s;tice be re|&s;trained? The danger is &s;o great and &s;o obvi|ous that in every &s;tate &s;uperior tribunals are appointed for correcting and curbing the in|ju&s;tice of the inferior. But if the &s;upreme tri|bunal be corrupted, the evil is without a re|medy: then the oppre&s;&s;ed complain in vain, they &s;igh in &s;ecret, and are afraid to &s;eek re|dre&s;s; then the injured man who had the boldne&s;s to &s;eek redre&s;s for his violated rights, has the mortification to find the violation rati|fied, and doubled by his efforts to avoid it; then he who endeavoured to defend him&s;elf from a &s;light wrong, &s;ees his endeavours plunge him into ruin; then <HI>the wicked lifts up his horn on high</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxxv. 4, 5.</NOTE>, he ravages at his will, <HI>the land and all its inhabitants thereof are di&s;&s;olved</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;. 3.</NOTE>, <HI>the foundations of the earth are out of cour&s;e</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxxxii. 5.</NOTE>. Even to &s;eek redre&s;s again&s;t the iniquity of a &s;ubordinate judge, is often grievous; the weak may be cru&s;hed, the poor may be beggared by the inju&s;tice of the meane&s;t magi&s;trate; they are unable to pro&s;ecute their cau&s;e, though it be unque&s;tionably good; they mu&s;t &s;it down ruined, that they may avoid deeper ruin. The very &s;u&s;picion of inju&s;tice in judges, is of per|nicious
<PB N="65" REF="71">
con&s;equence: it deprives men of that &s;en&s;e of &s;ecurity, which is nece&s;&s;ary to the comfort of life, and is one of happie&s;t effects of a free con&s;titution of government; it fills them with habitual apprehen&s;ion that their mo&s;t perfect rights may be invaded; it makes them dread to vindicate them when they are invaded; it dejects and torments their &s;ouls with all tho&s;e terrors which are incident to the &s;ubjects of de&s;poti&s;m; it impre&s;&s;es them with the gloomy idea that all things are precarious. Say every feeling heart, are not the uncertain|ties, the anxieties, the perplexities of this &s;ituation real and grievous &s;ufferings?</P>
<P>JUSTICE is of the greate&s;t advantage, as well as of the utmo&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, to &s;ociety. The univer&s;al practice of it is one of the lead|ing features in the fiction of the golden age; the happine&s;s of that period, the poets place principa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly in this, that crimes and injuries were unknown. The imperfection and de|pravity of makind render it impo&s;&s;ible that that fiction &s;hould be realized. Incorruptible ju&s;|tice in all the rulers of a nation, puts &s;ociety in the &s;tate which approaches neare&s;t to it. In that &s;tate, injuries may be done, but they meet with quick and certain redre&s;s; crimes may be committed, but they pa&s;s not with impunity, though they &s;hould be committed
<PB N="66" REF="72">
by the greate&s;t: every per&s;on feels that all his rights are &s;afe, that if they be attacked by the wickedne&s;s of individuals, they will be pro|tected by the integrity of the judge; the &s;en&s;e of this &s;ecurity keeps every heart at ea&s;e, marks every face with &s;erenity, and fills every life with comfort.&mdash;If then the nece&s;&s;ity and the e&s;&s;ential utility of a virtue, be the mea|&s;ure of the &s;trictne&s;s of its obligation, what obligation can be &s;tricter than the obligation of rulers to be ju&s;t?</P>
<P>JUSTICE is incumbent on private per&s;ons only by virtue of its own obligation; yet on them it is indi&s;pen&s;ibly incumbent: it is in|cumbent on judges by the &s;ame obligation; but on them it is incumbent al&s;o by other ob|ligations. It is incumbent by the obligation of fidelity: the execution of ju&s;tice is a tru&s;t committed to them. It is, in effect, the po|&s;itive charge of &s;ociety to every judge, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, it is the expre&s;s charge of God him&s;elf to every judge when divine providence rai&s;es him to his office, <HI>Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e heed what ye do; for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment: wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed and do it; for there is&punc; no iniquity with the Lord, nor re&s;pect of per&s;ons, nor taking of gifts</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. xix. 6, 7.</NOTE>. <HI>Thus &s;hall ye do</HI>

<P>THE actual &s;entiments of mankind own the conclu&s;ion, that ju&s;tice is of peculiar obliga|tion upon judges, and confirm the rea&s;oning by which we have evinced it. Ju&s;tice un|corrupted, and even un&s;u&s;pected, is deemed &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the character of a judge, that a per&s;on who di&s;regarded any of its private of|fices, would, by the univer&s;al voice of man|kind, be pronounced for that rea&s;on unfit to &s;u&s;tain the character of a judge. In a judge, every &s;pecies of fraud and inju&s;tice would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eclared more un&s;uitable, more atrocious, more inexcu&s;able, than in another. Were his pri|vate ju&s;tice perfectly unblamable, habitual unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in his judicial capacity would bla&s;t his reputation; a &s;ingle in&s;tance of wilful unrighteou&s;ne&s;s would indelibly fix &s;ome &s;tain
<PB N="68" REF="74">
upon his name. The terrors of his power, or re&s;pect for his rank and office, may move men to condemn in &s;ilence, and to behave with great external deference, and may hinder him from di&s;covering how low he &s;tands in the e&s;timation of the worthy: but they cannot &s;uppre&s;s the &s;entiments of the hone&s;t heart: even re&s;pect for the office changes its nature, and, in&s;tead of communicating it&s;elf to the per&s;on who holds it, inflames our indignation again&s;t him for abu&s;ing and di&s;gracing it. Former ages have afforded in&s;tances of judges notoriou&s;ly arbitrary and unju&s;t: they were abhorred by their contemporaries; and the im|partiality of hi&s;tory has &s;tigmatized them, I may &s;ay, with deeper infamy than the vile&s;t criminal that ever they condemned. There have been periods when &s;uch judges have been &s;ought for, &s;upported, and encouraged, by the tyranny of governors, or by the factious mad|ne&s;s of the people: but the&s;e periods are and ever will be branded as the mo&s;t di&s;graceful and infamous periods in the hi&s;tory of human &s;ociety.</P>
<P>IF now, my brethren, it has been proved, that ju&s;tice is the immediate and proximate in|&s;trument of accompli&s;hing the very end of the office of rulers, magi&s;trates, and judges, that they alone have opportunity for many impor|tant
<PB N="69" REF="75">
exerci&s;es of ju&s;tice,&mdash;and that they lie un|der peculiar obligations to it,&mdash;may we not fairly conclude, that ju&s;tice is peculiarly their virtue, the immediate, the proper, the mo&s;t indi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">en&s;ible decorum of their character? If this maxim be ju&s;t, the con&s;equence is obvi|ous and undeniable, that all magi&s;trates and judges ought to adhere to ju&s;tice with perfect inflexibility, and to practice it with the ut|mo&s;t diligence, and the mo&s;t &s;erupulous ex|actne&s;s. This con&s;equence demands not the attention only of a few. It fixes the duty, not only of perpetual judges, nor only of temporary magi&s;trates, but al&s;o of all who are of juries in public trials, or arbitrators in pri|vate differences. Every man may be, mo&s;t men actually actually are, &s;ometimes in a &s;ituation where ju&s;tice is, in the peculiar man|ner that has been de&s;cribed, incumbent on them: whenever they are, they render them|&s;elves ba&s;e, if they allow their ju&s;tice to be bia&s;&s;ed.</P>

<BIBL>GEN. iii. 15.</BIBL>
<Q>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy &s;eed and her &s;eed: it &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE prophecy contained in the&s;e words, is the fir&s;t opening of Chri&s;tianity, the fir&s;t intimation of the Me&s;&s;iah, the fir&s;t pro|mi&s;e of redemption to fallen mankind. It is on this account remarkable. It is remarkable al&s;o in re&s;pect of its occa&s;ion, and of the man|ner in which it was pronounced.</P>
<P>GOD created our fir&s;t parents in perfect in|nocence, and de&s;igned them for immortality. The &s;ame goodne&s;s which determined him to create them, and to give them &s;o noble a na|ture, di&s;po&s;ed him likewi&s;e to make ample
<PB N="72" REF="77">
provi&s;ion for their &s;upport and their comfort. He placed them in the garden of Eden, which his own hand had adorned, and in which he had planted <HI>every tree plea&s;ant to the &s;ight and good for food</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. ii. 9.</NOTE>. He gave them liberty to fea&s;t on all the variety of fruits which it con|tained: and, for trial of their obedience, for|bad the fruit of only one tree in the mid&s;t of the garden, but forbad them that, with this expre&s;s threatening, <HI>In the day that thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 17.</NOTE>. Unthankful for the abundance which God had allowed them, regardle&s;s of his prohibition, unawed by his threatening, fir&s;t Eve &s;olicited by the &s;er|pent, and next Adam &s;educed by his wife, did eat the one forbidden kind of fruit.</P>
<P>THAT it was the devil, who tempted Eve, is acknowledged by all. It is the general opi|nion, either that he entered into one of the &s;erpents of the field, actuated its body, gave it &s;peech, and made it his in&s;trument in the temptation; or el&s;e that he a&s;&s;umed the form of one of them, and appeared in its likene&s;s. Had either of the&s;e been the ca&s;e, Eve could &s;carcely have failed to be &s;urpri&s;ed and terri|fied: the &s;erpents of the field were familiar to her: when &s;he heard one of them &s;peaking,
<PB N="73" REF="78">
and &s;peaking rationally, &s;he would have im|mediately run away, and knowing him to be only one of the brutes, &s;he would not have ea&s;ily allowed her&s;elf to be by him per&s;uaded out of her obedience to God.</P>
<P>SOME are therefore of opinion, that the de|vil did not, on this occa&s;ion, either employ any of the brute &s;erpents, or appear in the form of any of them. That he did, &s;eems in|deed to be implied in the words with which the hi&s;tory is introduced, <HI>Now the &s;erpent was more &s;ubtle than any bea&s;t of the field</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. iii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. But it &s;eeems to be implied in them only as they &s;tand in our tran&s;lation: the original may with equal propriety be rendered, <HI>Now there was a &s;erpent more &s;ubtle than any bea&s;t, or than all the bea&s;ts of the field</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As the words taken by them&s;elves bear this tran&s;lation, &s;o their con&s;truction with the &s;equ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">, &s;eems to require it. If we follow the common ver&s;ion, by the &s;erpent who was thus &s;ubtle, we mu&s;t under&s;tand the &s;erpentine kind in general, and then the next verb <GAP DESC="foreign"> will have no nominative: <HI>And he &s;aid unto the woman, Yea hath God &s;aid, Ye &s;hall not eat of every tree of the garden?</HI> Who &s;aid this to the woman? Not &s;urely the &s;erpentine kind in general; but it alone had been mentioned before. It mu&s;t have been &s;ome one individual &s;erpent that &s;aid &s;o; but no &s;uch had been &s;o much as hinted at. Accordingly they who follow this interpretation are forced to allow an ellip&s;is of the nominative, making Mo&s;es to &s;ay. &ldquo;The &s;erpentine kind was more &s;ubtle than any bea&s;t of the field, and the devil, &s;peaking out of (or a&s;&s;uming the form of) one individual of that kind, &s;aid unto the woman,&rdquo; &amp;c. This is extremely har&s;h and violent.</NOTE>: not one of the bea&s;ts
<PB N="74" REF="79">
of the field, but a being far more intelligent than any of them, than of them all together, a being of an higher order, the devil. In the account of the creation which Mo&s;es had be|fore given, he had no occa&s;ion to mention the devil: but being now to relate a tran&s;action in which the devil was the fir&s;t mover, he very properly introduces it with an intimation, that there is &s;uch a being as the devil. But why does he call the devil a &s;erpent, if he neither a&s;&s;umed the form of one, nor u&s;ed one as his in&s;trument? He might very properly call him a &s;erpent, without any regard to his form, on account of his &s;ubtlety. It is common to expre&s;s a rational being by the name of &s;ome animal to who&s;e qualities his di&s;po&s;ition bears a re&s;emblance; there are in&s;tances of it in parts of &s;cripture not the mo&s;t figurative <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. iii. 7. xii. 34. xxiii. 33. Luke iii. 7. xiii. 32.2 Tim. iv. 17.</NOTE>; the &s;er|pent has been con&s;idered in all ages as an em|blem of malice and of cunning; the &s;cripture in&s;inuates this very rea&s;on for giving the name to the devil; he is <HI>that old &s;erpent called the devil and Satan, which</HI> DECEIVETH <HI>the whole world</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. xii. 9.</NOTE>. He might be called a &s;erpent, like|wi&s;e, on account of his own angelic form. All the names of intellectual things and &s;pi|ritual beings are figurative, being taken from tho&s;e material and &s;en&s;ible things which bear
<PB N="75" REF="80">
an analogy to them. Seraphs were &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;emble the winged fiery &s;erpent in their form, and had their name from them, on ac|count of this re&s;emblance: the <HI>fiery &s;erpents</HI> which <HI>the Lord &s;ent among the people</HI> of I&s;rael in the wilderne&s;s, are called <HI>&s;erpents &s;eraphim</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"> Num. xxi. 6.</NOTE>; and the <HI>&s;erpent of bra&s;s</HI> made by Mo&s;es on that occa&s;ion, is called &s;imply a <HI>&s;eraph</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"> ver. 8.</NOTE>. The devil probably appeared to Eve in the form of a &s;eraph, &s;he took him for an angel of light, conver&s;ed with him as &s;uch, and therefore li&s;tened to him without &s;urprize, without &s;u&s;picion, and was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded by him. It was this &s;erpent, metaphorically &s;o called, that tempted Eve: it is this one individual &s;erpent, the devil, not the whole &s;erpentine kind, nor any particular &s;pecies of it, that is &s;poken of through the whole of this hi&s;tory. This &s;uppo&s;ition agrees perfectly with the whole tenour of the hi&s;tory, and cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ars it from many difficulties in which the other &s;uppo&s;itions have involved it.</P>
<P>SOON after our fir&s;t parents had &s;inned, they heard the voice of Jehovah <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. iii. 8.</NOTE>. They had often heard it; and always hitherto it had been plea&s;ant to them. But now it was ter|rible; they endeavoured to hide them&s;elves.
<PB N="76" REF="81">
God found them out, and extorted a confe&s;|&s;ion from them, that they had di&s;obeyed their maker. Fir&s;t Adam owned that he had eaten, but accu&s;ed the woman of having given him the fruit. Next Eve confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he had eaten, but laid the blame upon the &s;erpent: <HI>the &s;erpent,</HI> that &s;erpent, probably pointing to him, or ca&s;ting her eye upon him, <HI>beguiled me, and I did eat</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 9&mdash;13.</NOTE>. This &s;erpent, the temp|ter, was pre&s;ent: either detained by the power of God; or of choice, exulting in his &s;uc|ce&s;s, eager to overhear the doom of the de|luded pair, to enjoy his victory, and to triumph over them.</P>
<P>BEHOLD now God appearing in the Sche|chinah! the two apo&s;tate parents of the hu|man race, and the Seraph who had tempted them to apo&s;tacy, &s;tand before him. He &s;its in judgment, and pa&s;&s;es a &s;eparate &s;entence upon each. He pa&s;&s;es &s;entence fir&s;t upon the Tempter <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 14, 15.</NOTE>. This was fit in order to check his exultation: it made him feel that, in re|ducing them to mi&s;ery, he had reduced him|&s;elf to greater mi&s;ery. If we con&s;ider the &s;en|tence as pa&s;&s;ed on the brute &s;erpents, it is trif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ing and liable to endle&s;s difficulties: but if we con&s;ider it as re&s;pecting only the devil,
<PB N="77" REF="82">
it has great propriety and dignity, and every part of it is expre&s;&s;ed with very &s;triking beauty. He appeared now, as he had appeared while tempting Eve, in the &s;eraphic form; and all the expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed in the judgment pro|nounced again&s;t him, have a double reference to that &s;eraphic form, and to the &s;erpentine form which it re&s;embles. <HI>And the Lord God &s;aid unto the &s;erpent;</HI> not unto the &s;erpents of the field, but unto the &s;erpent who now &s;tood before him, the &s;ame individual being who is &s;poken of through the whole hi&s;tory: to him &s;olely, the whole &s;entence is directed, without the mo&s;t di&s;tant intimation that any part of it regarded the &s;erpents of the field. <HI>Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t done this; Thou;</HI> not a brute &s;erpent; a brute &s;erpent neither did, nor could have done it; but the one &s;eraphic &s;erpent the devil; he it was who had beguiled Eve. Therefore, &s;ays God, <HI>Thou,</HI> the &s;ame indivi|dual &s;erpent, the devil, <HI>art cur&s;ed above all cattle, and above every bea&s;t of the field:</HI> thou art devoted to a puni&s;hment which, far &s;u|perior as thine original nature was to theirs, &s;hall render thee more vile, abject, and mi&s;e|rable, than the meane&s;t of the brutes, more an object of God's di&s;plea&s;ure, and of the hatred of all good beings, than any other creature is. <HI>Upon thy belly &s;halt thou go:</HI> this is not meant again&s;t the brute &s;erpents; it is not true of

all of them, for flying &s;erpents, it is &s;aid, con|tinued to exi&s;t after this; of the other &s;erpents it would have been impertinent, for to them going on their bellies was e&s;&s;ential from the creation. It was directed only to the &s;educer; and, if it be explained according to the u&s;age of &s;cripture &s;tile, it will appear in re&s;pect of him to have great truth and propriety. It was directed to him in his &s;eraphic form, which re&s;embled the &s;erpentine; the manner of expre&s;&s;ion is cho|&s;en with a view to that re&s;emblance, and inti|mates his puni&s;hment in allu&s;ion to it; it inti|mates that he was now as much degraded as if his &s;eraphic form were converted into that of a groveling &s;erpent, as if from flying on high, he were reduced to creep upon his belly. This figurative expre&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t one per|fectly &s;imilar to it, is u&s;ed el&s;ewhere in &s;crip|ture, and had become proverbial, to &s;ignify a reduction to the lowe&s;t affliction and humi|liation: it is very deep affliction which the P&s;almi&s;t intends to de&s;cribe, when he &s;ays, <HI>Our &s;oul is bowed down to the du&s;t, our belly cleaveth unto the earth</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xliv. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>; it is what in the pre|ceding ver&s;es he had called, <HI>affliction, oppre&s;|&s;ion,</HI> being <HI>killed all day long, counted as &s;heep for the &s;laughter, ca&s;t off</HI> by God <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 22, 23, 24.</NOTE>. Its &s;imple meaning in this cur&s;e is, Thou &s;halt be de|graded
<PB N="79" REF="84">
from all thine original dignity and ce|le&s;tial glory, thou &s;halt lo&s;e all the preroga|tives of thy nature, thou &s;halt be ca&s;t down to &s;hame, and infamy, and reduced to an abject and vile condition. <HI>And du&s;t &s;halt thou eat all the days of thy life:</HI> the meaning is not, Thou &s;halt feed wholly upon du&s;t, but, Thou &s;halt lick up du&s;t together with thy food: &s;till the allu&s;ion to &s;erpents, whom the devil's &s;eraphic form re&s;embled, is beautifully kept up. But it is not a &s;entence pronounced again&s;t brute &s;erpents; it was true before of them, that they licked up du&s;t along with their food; and this is not peculiar to them, it is common to them with all animals that feed from off the ground.

perhaps, by deceiving the woman, to bring on them immediate death, and extingui&s;h the whole &s;pecies at once, and they would readily fear this: but God promi&s;es that the woman &s;hall have &s;eed.

The import of this promi&s;e has been illu&s;trated by po&s;terior prophe&s;ies, and &s;till more by the event, &s;o that it is made to &s;hine to us like <HI>the day-&s;tar.</HI> With regard both to the &s;ucceeding prophe&s;ies, and the de&s;criptions of the event, &s;ome are expre&s;&s;ed in terms &s;imilar to tho&s;e u&s;ed here, on purpo&s;e to &s;how that they belong to the &s;ame &s;ubject; and others are expre&s;&s;ed in very different terms, either in proper words or in di&s;&s;imilar meta|phors, that by comparing them all together, we may the better apprehend the preci&s;e mean|ing of all the terms, and under&s;tand the whole &s;ubject more perfectly.

a promi&s;e of the Redeemer, which is com|monly ob&s;erved in it, but al&s;o, which is not &s;o commonly ob&s;erved, to repre&s;ent in brief, but with great exactne&s;s, the whole religious and moral &s;tate of this world; from the fall of man to the con&s;ummation of all things.</P>
<P>IN what remains of this di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall illu&s;trate the &s;everal particulars of this pro|mi&s;e; and then make &s;ome reflections on it.</P>
<P>FIRST, It is here intimated that the wo|man &s;hould have &s;eed; and it is intimated in &s;uch a manner as to imply an accurate predic|tion of the miraculous birth of the Redeemer.</P>
<P>OUR fir&s;t parents probably apprehended, and the Tempter hoped, that God would con|demn them to immediate death. While they were trembling under this apprehen&s;ion, they hear God declare that the woman &s;hall have &s;eed: this was comfortable to them; it im|plied that their lives were to be prolonged. At the time, they would perhaps conceive the&s;e words to mean only any de&s;cendant from them. That Eve expected the per&s;on thus promi&s;ed, in Cain her elde&s;t &s;on, is by &s;ome thought to be intimated by what &s;he &s;aid at his birth, which they render, <HI>I have gotten a man, the</HI>

<HI>Lord</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. iv. 1.</NOTE>. It was even merciful in God to give them only an ob&s;cure and general intimation of the great Deliverer: had they known that he was not to appear till after &s;o many ages, it might have &s;unk them in dejection.</P>
<P>BUT however ob&s;cure their conception of him may have been, this intimation is very preci&s;e; it is an exact de&s;cription of a wonder|ful event, of the extraordinary and miraculous conception of the Saviour of mankind. The po&s;terity is always reckoned after the man; this expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>the &s;eed of the woman,</HI> is with|out a parallel in &s;cripture; the mo&s;t learned Jews hold it to be wholly unaccountable. But <HI>their minds</HI> are, as the apo&s;tle affirms <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iii. 14, 15.</NOTE>, <HI>blinded,</HI> and there is <HI>a vail upon their hearts, in the read|ing of the old te&s;tament;</HI> el&s;e, &s;ingular as the expre&s;&s;ion is, it needed not appear inexplicable to them: for they have in their own &s;crip|tures, a prediction expre&s;&s;ed indeed in different words, but which in &s;en&s;e perfectly coincides with it, and explains it. <HI>Behold,</HI> &s;ays I&s;aiah <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. vii. 14.</NOTE>, <HI>a virgin &s;hall conceive, and bear a &s;on.</HI> That per&s;on who was born of a virgin is with the &s;tricte&s;t propriety called <HI>the &s;eed of the woman;</HI> he is, what no other ever was or &s;hall be, the &s;eed of the woman only, not of the man.
<PB N="86" REF="91">
The expre&s;&s;ion would indeed be improper and inexplicable, if there were not &s;uch an event corre&s;ponding to it; and if there be &s;uch an event, this &s;ingular expre&s;&s;ion was doubtle&s;s cho&s;en on purpo&s;e to mark its peculiarity.</P>
<P>IT is in the go&s;pel that we find that won|derful event. Je&s;us of Nazar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">th was born of the virgin Mary, having been conceived of the Holy Gho&s;t. Matthew mentions this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. i. 18, 20.</NOTE>. Luke gives a particular account of it <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. i. 26. 38.</NOTE>. Paul takes notice of it in terms which point out Je&s;us as the per&s;on de&s;igned in this fir&s;t proph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">y: <HI>When the fulne&s;s of the time was come, God &s;ent forth his &s;on made of a woman</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> 4.</NOTE>.

<P>SECONDLY, It is foretold in this predic|tion, that there &s;hould be a perpetual oppo&s;i|tion between this per&s;on and the devil. Satan was already the declared enemy of mankind;
<PB N="87" REF="92">
and one born of a woman is, by the appoint|ment of God him&s;elf, to enter the li&s;ts with him, and war again&s;t him. <HI>I will put enmity,</HI> &s;ays God, <HI>between thee and the woman, and between thy &s;eed and her &s;eed.</HI> Satan probably hoped that the matter was ab&s;olutely deter|mined, and our fir&s;t parents <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">inally and irre|trievably ruined, by the overthrow which he had already given them; and they feared that it was &s;o: it mu&s;t have yielded them &s;ome com|fort, even to know that there was &s;till room for a conte&s;t.</P>
<P>THESE words are addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;ame &s;erpent who had been &s;poken of all along. Being thus addre&s;&s;ed to o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e, they cannot re|fer to all the brute &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rpents.

The devil who had deceived Eve, the prince of the apo&s;tate &s;pirits, is the &s;erpent here meant. By his &s;eed, we mu&s;t under&s;tand &s;uch progeny as an angel can have.

formed by his influence, and they bear his image; and on this account they are in &s;crip|ture called <HI>the children of the devil,</HI> and as &s;uch oppo&s;ed to good men, who are named <HI>the chil|dren of God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> John iii. 9, 10.</NOTE>. The&s;e are the parties on one &s;ide of this conte&s;t.</P>
<P>THE parties on the other &s;ide are <HI>the wo|man and her &s;eed.</HI> It is Je&s;us Chri&s;t who is meant by <HI>the &s;eed</HI> of the woman; the manner of expre&s;&s;ion points to him: he is the princi|pal in this oppo&s;ition to the devil. The wo|man her&s;elf is al&s;o mentioned: Eve could ne|ver certainly think without dete&s;tation of the devil, who had &s;o maliciou&s;ly deceived her. But by the woman is not meant Eve alone; Chri&s;t was not the &s;eed of Eve exclu&s;ive of Adam; his virgin mother was equally de|&s;cended from them both. The woman is not mentioned here, becau&s;e &s;he was to bear any peculiar enmity to Satan; her enmity is com|mon to all of her po&s;terity who re&s;emble her in dete&s;ting the devil and his works: but &s;he is mentioned, becau&s;e it was &s;he that had been deceived by Satan, and, perhaps chiefly, to give occa&s;ion for predicting him who was pe|culiarly <HI>the &s;eed of the woman:</HI> accordingly in the following clau&s;es, the mention of the wo|man
<PB N="89" REF="94">
is entirely dropt, and only her &s;eed &s;poken of. Good men are indeed, under Chri&s;t, engaged in this conte&s;t; but their being engaged in it, is not directly intimated by the expre&s;&s;ions here u&s;ed; it is only re|motely and by a metonymy implied, as they may be con&s;idered, according to the repre&s;en|tations of &s;cripture in other places, as members of Chri&s;t, and fighting in his &s;trength.</P>
<P>IT is here foretold then, that there would be a perpetual and irreconcileable oppo&s;ition between the devil, evil &s;pirits, and wicked men on the one hand, and Chri&s;t on the other hand. From the moment of the fall, it has been &s;o, in every &s;en&s;e in which the predic|tion can be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>IN the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, it intimates a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> conte&s;t between the&s;e parties; and in this &s;en&s;e it was literally fulfilled. Devils and wicked men have from the beginning exerted them&s;elves in propagating idolatry and vice, and overwhelming the world with mi&s;ery. That the Son of God was per&s;onally engaged, even before his incarnation, in counteracting their de&s;igns, there are many hints in &s;crip|ture; his <HI>goings forth have been from of old, from the days of the age; and he continued to give them until the time that &s;he who was a|bearing</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="95">
<HI>had borne</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the true &s;en&s;e of Mic. v. 2, 3.</NOTE>. But after &s;he had borne, after the Son of God had become the &s;eed of the woman, there was a per&s;onal conte&s;t in the propere&s;t &s;en&s;e. The devil him&s;elf tempted Chri&s;t in the wilderne&s;s; and by his in&s;tru|ments he laboured ince&s;&s;antly to defeat his views, to rai&s;e prejudices again&s;t his per&s;on, his doctrine, his actions, and his miracles. Herod endeavoured to murder him in his in|fancy. The Jews per&s;ecuted him all his days, and at la&s;t crucified him. In &s;o doing, they &s;howed that they were, as our Saviour on this very account calls them, <HI>&s;erpents</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxiii. 33.</NOTE>, <HI>a genera|tion of vipers</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. iii. 7. xii. 34. Luke iii. 7.</NOTE>, <HI>of</HI> their <HI>father the devil</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">John viii. 41&mdash;44.</NOTE>: they did his works, and they were in&s;tigated by him. By the &s;ame in&s;tigation Judas betrayed Chri&s;t to death; Satan had <HI>entered into him</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Luke xxii. 3. John xiii. 2. 27.</NOTE>, and moved him to it. On the other hand, Je&s;us Chri&s;t re&s;i&s;ted the devil, and, during the whole of his life in the fle&s;h, oppo&s;ed his de&s;igns and intere&s;ts, ca&s;ting out unclean &s;pirits, healing tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which &s;in had brought into the world, combating the vices of wicked men, and, till his hour was come, eluding and de|feating their malicious attempts again&s;t him|&s;elf. Since his exaltation he is invi&s;ible, but he is repre&s;ented in &s;cripture as the head of the
<PB N="91" REF="96">
church, con&s;tantly employing his power for promoting true religion, virtue, and happi|ne&s;s: and the devil is repre&s;ented as the ruler of the kingdom of darkne&s;s, and, along with wicked men, intent upon, and active in op|po&s;ing him and promoting the contrary views.</P>
<P>BUT the words of the prediction need not be re&s;tricted to &s;uch a per&s;onal conduct. The devil is here &s;poken of as the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ad of the apo|&s;ta&s;y, who had become a rebel again&s;t God, &s;et up a kingdom in direct oppo&s;ition to God's kingdom, a kingdom of wickedne&s;s, and la|boured to &s;pread &s;in and mi&s;ery; and his off|&s;pring are con&s;idered as acting under him in carrying on his plan: when the&s;e per&s;ons are therefore in this way mentioned, the cau&s;e in which they are engaged may, by a very common figure, be under&s;tood. Chri&s;t is here predicted preci&s;ely as the Head of man's recovery: from the moment of the fall, he was, by divine appointment, the governor of God's kingdom here below, the kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s and felicity: and therefore, though he alone be mentioned, both they who are the &s;ubjects of his kingdom, and the cau&s;e which is its great object, may, by the &s;ame figure, be intended. By this very figure, all good is a&s;cribed to God, and all evil to the devil: this implies the &s;ame idea which we &s;uppo&s;e in the text;
<PB N="92" REF="97">
and this is the common language of &s;cripture. The&s;e two kingdoms, the kingdom of Satan, and the kingdom of God of which Chri&s;t is the immediate governour, are contrary and irreconcileable in every point, in their na|tures, in their views, and in the principles which their re&s;pective votaries act upon. It is here predicted, That neither of the two &s;hould ab&s;olutely prevail in the pre&s;ent world, that there &s;hould be a perpetual &s;truggle be|tween them. The prediction has been pre|ci&s;ely accompli&s;hed. It is an exact de&s;cription of the pre&s;ent mixed &s;tate of things, in which good and evil, virtue and vice, happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, though in different proportions, yet &s;till are blended together, and counteract each other.</P>
<P>IT has been accompli&s;hed in the character and condition of every individual of the hu|man race. Every human character is imper|fect and mixed. Since the fall there has not been a &s;ingle mere man either uniformly good or uniformly bad. The wor&s;t men are not wholly de&s;titute of all good qualities, and the be&s;t are not altogether free from vice. In &s;ome men, very great virtues have been united with very great vices.

<P>IT has been accompli&s;hed likewi&s;e in the general &s;tate of the world.

The pre|ceding di&s;cour&s;e was, therefore, introduced by &s;howing, That it regards, not the brute &s;erpents, neither the whole kind, nor any par|ticular &s;pecies of them, but &s;olely the devil, who had tempted Eve, and who is called the &s;erpent on account of his malicious cunning, and probably too on account of his own &s;era|phic form. It is thought to have re&s;embled the &s;erpentine; and, if it did, it gave a natural
<PB N="100" REF="105">
occa&s;ion both for the name by which the devil is here mentioned, and for the metaphorical ex|pre&s;&s;ions employed in the &s;entence pronounced again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t part of that &s;entence intimates the condition to which the devil was immediately condemned, and, in metaphorical but expre&s;&s;ive terms, de&s;cribes it as abject, vile, and mi&s;erable. The &s;econd part of it declares what would then<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">forth be the condition of the devil in re|lation to mankind; and it contains a prophetical delineation, general, but very preci&s;e, of the religious and moral &s;tate of this lower world, from the fall of man to the con&s;ummation of all things. It is delivered in the&s;e words, <HI>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy &s;eed and her &s;eed: it &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel.</HI> The particulars of this prediction are four; I pro|po&s;ed to explain them in their order.</P>
<P>FIRST, It is here intimated that our fir&s;t parents, in&s;tead of being &s;ubjected to immediate death, &s;hould have po&s;terity: the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>the &s;eed of the woman</HI> runs through all the clau&s;es of the text; and it is an expre&s;&s;ion which naturally implies the miraculous con|ception of the great Deliverer, which points to, and had an exact completion in Je&s;us
<PB N="101" REF="106">
Chri&s;t, who being born of the virgin Mary, was the &s;eed of the woman only, not of the man.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, It is here declared that there would be a perpetual oppo&s;ition between the promi&s;ed Deliverer of mankind, and the devil, who had &s;educed them into apo&s;ta&s;y: <HI>I will put enmity,</HI> &s;ays God, <HI>between thee and the woman, and between thy &s;eed and her &s;eed.</HI> The&s;e words may &s;ignify a per&s;onal conte&s;t be|tween that Deliverer on the one hand, and evil &s;pirits and wicked men on the other: and &s;uch a conte&s;t there was, e&s;pecially after that Deliverer had become <HI>the &s;eed of the woman,</HI> in the days of Chri&s;t's fle&s;h. The words may likewi&s;e &s;ignify a &s;truggle between the two op|po&s;ite cau&s;es, the cau&s;e of virtue and happine&s;s, of which Chri&s;t is by God's appointment the head, and the cau&s;e of wickedne&s;s and mi&s;ery, which is patroni&s;ed by the devil, and e&s;pou&s;ed by vicious men. Con&s;idered in this light, they contain an accurate de&s;cription of the mixt &s;tate of things, which has actually taken place in this lower world, ever &s;ince the fall. Virtues and vices, good and bad qualities, are united in the character, and plea&s;ures and pains, en|joyments and &s;ufferings, are blended in the condition of every individual of the human &s;pecies. In every age, in every nation, in
<PB N="102" REF="107">
every &s;ociety, good and bad men live promi&s;|cuou&s;ly together, &s;haring in the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ings, involved in the &s;ame calamities, but actuated by oppo&s;ite principles, and engaged in contrary cour&s;es. I formerly explained the&s;e two parts of the prediction.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, We are here a&s;&s;ured that the i&s;&s;ue of this conte&s;t &s;hall be fatal to the devil and his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS part of the prediction is expre&s;&s;ed in terms which might agree to the brute &s;erpents; <HI>It,</HI> the &s;eed of the woman, <HI>&s;hall brui&s;e thy head.</HI> But it refers not to them: to have foretold that men &s;hould now and then kill a &s;erpent by cru&s;hing its head, would have been trivial and unworthy of the occa&s;ion. It has a much more important meaning. The terms are only borrowed from brute &s;erpents, to be metapho|rically applied to the &s;eraph who had beguiled Eve. The metaphor is per&s;picuous and &s;trong. It is in the head of the &s;erpent that its poi&s;on lies; and the cru&s;hing of its head immediately and mo&s;t certainly kills it. The figurative ex|pre&s;&s;ion here u&s;ed has, therefore, this plain meaning; That the de&s;cendant of the woman, now promi&s;ed, &s;hall obtain a complete victory over the devil, deprive him of his power to hurt, aboli&s;h his dominion and influence, and finally puni&s;h and de&s;troy him.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="108">HE had &s;ucceeded in deceiving the woman; &s;he now appeared weak and wretched in his eyes: but this very woman, it is foretold, &s;hall be his de&s;truction; from her a per&s;on is to &s;pring, who &s;hall reduce him to greater weakne&s;s and deeper wretchedne&s;s. He had hoped to become ab&s;o|lute lord of this lower world: but, as it was declared in the preceding clau&s;e, that his u&s;urped dominion over it would be always incomplete, it is here foretold that this dominion &s;hall be at la&s;t totally overthrown. Our fir&s;t parents could not but under&s;tand his de&s;igns again&s;t them, &s;o far as to perceive that he had &s;educed them into &s;in, and that he had intended to &s;ubject them to death, and to deprive them of the happine&s;s for which they were made. When, therefore, his de&s;truction, by means of the woman's &s;eed, was predicted, they mu&s;t have &s;een that the prediction implied an a&s;|&s;urance, that his malicious contrivances again&s;t mankind would be defeated, their &s;in forgiven, and them&s;elves delivered from death and re|&s;tored to happine&s;s. It led them to expect a redeemer in human nature, who would recover them from that &s;tate into which, through the temptation of the devil, they had fallen.</P>
<P>THIS part of the prediction has not re|ceived its full accompli&s;hment: it regards the final i&s;&s;ue of the conte&s;t proclaimed in the
<PB N="104" REF="109">
preceding clau&s;e, and which was to continue through the whole of the pre&s;ent &s;tate: till that conte&s;t, therefore, be concluded, till the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things come to an end, the ac|compli&s;hment of this promi&s;e mu&s;t remain in|complete. But it has been already fulfilled in &s;ome part; it is fulfilled in every advantage which Chri&s;t obtains over the devil, and in every advantage which the cau&s;e of virtue gains over the cau&s;e of vice: &s;o far it is illu&s;trated by the event. At the &s;ame time, in other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, we have many de&s;criptions of the i&s;&s;ue of that conte&s;t, and of the manner in which it &s;hall be brought about, which render this fir&s;t intimation of it much clearer to us, than it could be to our fir&s;t parents. Some of the&s;e de&s;criptions are expre&s;&s;ed in &s;o plain an al|lu&s;ion to the text, as to direct us to regard the &s;ubject of them as intended by it, and fulfill|ing it; and others are expre&s;&s;ed in terms fit for throwing light on tho&s;e which are employed here, and rendering their meaning ea&s;ily intel|ligible.</P>
<P>GOD promi&s;es that in the <HI>per&s;onal</HI> con|te&s;t, which had been ju&s;t now foretold be|tween Chri&s;t on the one &s;ide, and devils and wicked men on the other &s;ide, Chri&s;t &s;hould have the advantage, and at la&s;t ob|tain a complete victory.&mdash;Already he hath
<PB N="105" REF="110">
had great advantage. In every a&s;&s;ault which the devil made upon him per&s;onally, in his &s;tate of incarnation, Chri&s;t was conqueror. When the devil tempted him, he baffled all his temptations. He ca&s;t multitudes of devils out of tho&s;e who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them; and gave his di&s;ciples al&s;o power to ca&s;t them out in his name; thus depriving evil &s;pirits of their dominion over mankind, and rendering them &s;ub&s;ervient to the glory of his miracles. In reference to this kind of miracles he &s;ays, <HI>I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke x. 18.</NOTE>. The terms in which he expre&s;&s;es the powers granted to his de&s;ciples, are remarkably ana|logous to tho&s;e of the text, and point out the&s;e miracles as fulfilments of it, <HI>Behold I give unto you power to tread on &s;erpents and &s;corpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing &s;hall by any means hurt you</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 19.</NOTE>.

In &s;pight of all oppo&s;ition, Chri&s;t fini&s;hed the
<PB N="106" REF="111">
work given him to do on earth; he adhered to truth and goodne&s;s to the end: and when he died a martyr to them, he triumphed over the devil and all his agents, by ri&s;ing again from the dead, and a&s;cending into heaven. His a&s;cen&s;ion, the &s;cripture a&s;&s;ures us, was the celebration of his triumph, his acce&s;&s;ion to the kingdom here foretold. It a&s;&s;ures us that, <HI>when he a&s;cended up on high, he led captivity captive</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 8.</NOTE>; that <HI>having</HI> by <HI>his cro&s;s &s;poiled prin|cipalities and powers, he made a &s;hew of them openly triumphing over them it</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 14, 15.</NOTE>; and that he is <HI>&s;et at God's right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but al&s;o in that which is to come</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. i. 20, 21.</NOTE>.&mdash;But it is at the end of the world, that Chri&s;t's victory will be complete.

<P>GOD here foretells likewi&s;e, That the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of Chri&s;t, the cau&s;e of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall all along gain &s;ome advantages over the oppo&s;ite <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of Satan, the cau&s;e of idolatry and vice, and &s;hall finally triumph over it.&mdash;In conformity to this prediction, idolatry and ignorance of God have never pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">vailed &s;o uni|ver&s;ally, but that &s;ome &s;aint rays of religious knowledge have now and then &s;hone forth in one part of the world or another. When they were too weak to lead men off from the prac|tices of fal&s;e religion, they notwith&s;tanding often expo&s;ed its ab&s;urdity, and &s;ubjected it to ju&s;t contempt.

<P><PB N="110" REF="115">CHRIST'S victory over the devil, implies al&s;o the prevalence of virtue over vice.

Every part of the cur&s;e pronounced on the tempter, &s;poke comfort to our fir&s;t parents. God gave them this comfort, that they might not de&s;pond. He prevented their fear of in|&s;tant death; he a&s;&s;ured them, not only that they &s;hould live to have po&s;terity, but that among them there &s;hould be one great per&s;on, the Redeemer of his race, and that, through him, mankind &s;hould at la&s;t triumph, and their &s;educer be utterly de&s;troyed. God &s;uf|fered not him&s;elf to be an object of mere ter|ror to &s;inful man for a &s;ingle day: in the very hour of the provocation he allowed not mankind to con&s;ider them&s;elves as rejected by him. He gave them hope, that they might have a &s;trong motive to return to him by re|pentance, and to &s;tudy to regain his favour. To us, Chri&s;tians, he has given &s;tronger hope, by a fuller revelation of our redemption already accompli&s;hed: in this hope let us re|joice, and let our alacrity in endeavouring to plea&s;e God, be in proportion to the brightne&s;s of our hope.</P>
<P>2. WHAT has been &s;aid, may confirm our faith in Chri&s;t, and his go&s;pel. The pro|phecy which we have con&s;idered, is an inti|mation of the mo&s;t marvellous events: and

they have come to pa&s;s. They are the re|ver&s;e of what the devil, with all his know|ledge, looked for; and of what, with all his cunning, he intended by his machinations: yet they were exactly foretold in the very be|ginning of the world. Who could have fore|&s;een them at that time, but God? They are his appointment. Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the deliverer here predicted; to him every character of the deliverer belongs: he was born of a virgin; he is in direct and irreconcileable oppo&s;ition to the devil and his cau&s;e; he hath already greatly broken the power of Satan, and hath revealed to us in what manner he will totally de&s;troy it; and he hath &s;uffered and died in accom|pli&s;hing this great de&s;ign. On him we may &s;afely depend, as the promi&s;ed &s;eed, the re|&s;torer of the lo&s;t world, the conqueror over Satan, &s;in, and death.</P>
<P>3. WHAT has been &s;aid, tends to give us a ju&s;t conception of the &s;tate of things in this pre&s;ent world. It is obviou&s;ly a mixt and im|perfect &s;tate, and it has many appearances of irregularity and confu&s;ion. In it no character is wholly con&s;i&s;tent or of a piece. In it vir|tuous and vicious men are intermingled, and connected together by many ties. In it nei|ther is virtue uniformly rewarded, nor vice uniformly puni&s;hed; in innumerable in&s;tances
<PB N="122" REF="127">
good and evil are promi&s;cuou&s;ly di&s;tributed to the righteous and the wicked; and in many in&s;tances the wicked flouri&s;h and pro&s;per, while the righteous are un&s;ucce&s;sful and af|flicted. The&s;e appearances of di&s;order have been remarked in all ages; they have been urged by &s;ome as objections again&s;t the ju&s;tice of divine Providence, and they have &s;ometimes perplexed the mo&s;t mode&s;t and &s;erious enquirers into the ways of God. But this very &s;tate of things, the text informs us, is the appoint|ment of God him&s;elf; in the very beginning of the world, he declared that he had ap|pointed it. Being his appointment, it is un|alterable; in vain we fret and murmur at it; his &s;overeign will demands our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Being his appointment, it mu&s;t be wi&s;e, and ju&s;t, and gracious; the text &s;hows it to be eminently &s;uch. It was when the parents of the human race had merited in&s;tant death, by which the &s;pecies mu&s;t have been totally extir|pated, that God appointed this &s;tate of things: it was a gracious mitigation of their doom; it &s;hould be received by us as a favour and indul|gence. It was when our all &s;eemed to be ir|retrievably lo&s;t, that God appointed this &s;tate: it is a &s;ubject of gratitude and joy, rather than of regret and murmuring; ab&s;olute de&s;truction mu&s;t have been the portion of mankind, if God had not mercifully allowed them a new

&s;truggle again&s;t their &s;educer. The allowance is greatly merciful; by it God gives every in|dividual a new trial, and a trial with the un|&s;peakable advantage of its being under the con|duct of the great Deliverer, for immortal hap|pine&s;s and glory. The &s;eeming di&s;orders of the world are but the means of our trial; if we behave aright, they &s;hall contribute to our triumph. Great as they may be, they &s;hall not be perpetual; evil &s;hall be overthrown, good &s;hall prevail; this is not our final &s;tate: it &s;hall be &s;ucceeded by an everla&s;ting &s;tate, in which virtue and felicity &s;hall reign pure and unmixt.</P>

All men belong either to the one or to the other. This is the great di&s;tinction of mankind. Let us examine carefully, to which cla&s;s we belong. Are we yet engaged in the apo&s;ta&s;y from God? The devil is the head of that apo&s;ta&s;y. Are we yet impenitent in &s;in? Sin is the work of the devil; and they who do his work, are his &s;eed, and &s;hall be de&s;troyed with him.

<P>To compare the character, the office, and the actions of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as repre&s;ented in the hi&s;tory of the New Te&s;tament, with the prophecies concerning him in the Old, mu&s;t be an employment highly agreeable to every inqui&s;itive per&s;on who has a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the importance of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation.

<P>THE prophecies concerning the Me&s;&s;iah form a connected &s;eries.

<P>IT is a remarkable prophecy of the Saviour of the world, the promi&s;e which God made to Abraham, <HI>In thy &s;eed &s;hall all the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> In this di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall explain this prophecy, and &s;how that it was accompli&s;hed in Je&s;us of Nazareth.</P>
<P>IT gives intimation of three things:</P>

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THAT his undertaking &s;hould be highly beneficial to men, and render them <HI>ble&s;&s;ed;</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THAT the ble&s;&s;ings re&s;ulting from his undertaking, &s;hould not be confined to one nation, but extended to, <HI>all the nations of the earth.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="128" REF="133">IMMEDIATELY after the fall, God pro|mi&s;ed the Redeemer under the title of <HI>the</HI> SEED <HI>of the woman</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. iii. 15.</NOTE>, here he calls him the SEED of Abraham. The &s;imilitude of expre&s;&s;ion was intended to &s;how, that both predictions relate to the &s;ame per&s;on, that the author of ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s, now promi&s;ed to Abraham, is the &s;ame with the head of man's recovery, announced to our fir&s;t parents. In the fir&s;t promi&s;e, the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>the &s;eed of the woman</HI> intimates the &s;ingular manner in which the Redeemer &s;hould be conceived and born: the expre&s;&s;ion here u&s;ed gives no &s;uch intimation; it leaves this character of the Redeemer on the &s;ame footing on which that promi&s;e had put it; but in the ca&s;e of Abraham there was &s;omething peculiar; I&s;aac, from whom the Redeemer was to &s;pring, was born miraculou&s;ly of Sarah after &s;he was in the ordinary cour&s;e of nature incapable of having a child.

became nece&s;&s;ary to point out, from which of the&s;e the Saviour &s;hould &s;pring.

<P>To a&s;certain and limit, in this manner, the expectation of the Redeemer from time to time, was every way worthy of the divine wi&s;dom.&mdash;It was nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving the expectation of this great per&s;on in the world.

<P>THE determination of the Redeemer's origin was al&s;o of great importance both for &s;etting a&s;ide the preten&s;ions of impo&s;tors, and for giving evidence to the true Redeemer when he &s;hould ari&s;e.

<P>THE expre&s;&s;ion is general, it determines not the kind or degree of happine&s;s which the Redeemer would confer upon mankind; yet Abraham could not be at a lo&s;s to di&s;cern this.

to ignorant, weak, corrupt, guilty, and mortal creatures. Of him who confers them, it might be foretold with the greate&s;t rea&s;on, that in him men &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t promi&s;e it had been intimated that, in conquering Satan, the Redeemer &s;hould be a &s;ufferer; it had been &s;aid, <HI>Thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel.</HI> In the text it is only &s;aid that <HI>in him,</HI> that is, by means of him, the ble&s;&s;ing &s;hould come: but in what particular way he &s;hould procure it, the words give no intima|tion. They were connected, however, with a very remarkable event. God had commanded Abraham, <HI>Take now thy &s;on, thine only &s;on I&s;aac, whom thou love&s;t, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxii. 2.</NOTE>. Abraham had &s;et out, and, on the third day of his journey, was ju&s;t preparing to obey the hard command, when the angel of the Lord &s;topped his uplifted hand, pre&s;erved his &s;on, and provided another &s;acrifice. In appro|bation and reward of this in&s;tance of faith and obedience, the promi&s;e in the text was given, and confirmed by an oath. It is commonly allowed, that that whole tran&s;action was in|tended to give Abraham information of the death and &s;acrifice of the Redeemer, and was under&s;tood by him to typify and prefigure
<PB N="139" REF="144">
the&s;e: there is rea&s;on for allowing it. But whether in that tran&s;action Abraham perceived the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t, or not; whether they who lived before Chri&s;t's appearance, appre|hended its meaning &s;o far as to learn from it, that he was to die a &s;acrifice, or not; yet we who live after the event, can by its light per|ceive and do know that the whole tran&s;action was a type of the &s;ufferings and &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t. To us it is a proof, that this method of redemption was fore&s;een and foreordained by God. Between Abraham, at God's command, offering I&s;aac, the &s;on whom he loved, in &s;a|crifice, and God giving his only begotten and well-beloved &s;on to be a &s;acrifice for our &s;ins; between God's requiring I&s;aac, the very heir of the promi&s;e, the fir&s;t born of the covenant, to be offered, and his requiring Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great &s;ubject of that promi&s;e, the head of the covenant, to be made a propitiation for the &s;ins of the world; the &s;imilitude and corre&s;pond|ence is &s;o perfect as to leave no room for our doubting that the one was intended to be pro|phetical of the other. The conformity be|tween the types under the Old Te&s;tament, and the events of the New, happened not by chance; but was purpo&s;ely contrived to &s;hew us Chri&s;|tians, that the grand de&s;ign of man's redemp|tion which we &s;ee now accompli&s;hed, was ever in the view of God, was always carrying on,
<PB N="140" REF="145">
and ran through all the di&s;pen&s;ations of re|vealed religion.

The &s;ufferings to which he delivered him up, and by which he made <HI>the atonement</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. v. 11.</NOTE>, were clear|ly foretold in the cour&s;e of the prophecies: and in the New Te&s;tament we have the hi&s;tory of the &s;ufferings which Je&s;us underwent, and de&s;criptions of the efficacy of his &s;acrifice, ex|actly agreeable to the prophecies.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, It is foretold in the text, that the ble&s;&s;ings in this manner purcha&s;ed by the Redeemer, &s;hould extend to all nations.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t promi&s;e this was not expre&s;&s;ed; it was not nece&s;&s;ary; the fir&s;t parents of the whole human race were alike connected with all the kindreds of their po&s;terity. But now, when one nation was pointed out, from which the Redeemer was to &s;pring, there was great need to give intimation that he was not in|tended for the benefit of that nation only, but of all nations. This was the more nece&s;|&s;ary becau&s;e, along with the promi&s;e given to to Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob, that the Re|deemer was to &s;pring from them, there was
<PB N="141" REF="146">
con&s;tantly a promi&s;e al&s;o given them, of a temporal inheritance, of the land of Canaan <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xii. 1, 2. xv. 13&mdash;21. xvii. 8. xxii. 17. xxvi. 3, 4. xxviii. 13, 14, 15.</NOTE>, which was peculiar to their po&s;terity, and in which other nations had no intere&s;t. This might have led them to interpret the promi&s;e of the Saviour, as likewi&s;e peculiar to them|&s;elves. Their e&s;tabli&s;hment in the land of Ca|naan was made &s;ub&s;ervient to the great de|&s;ign of the redemption of the world, by pre|&s;erving among them the knowledge of the one true God, and by giving &s;cope to a long &s;eries of prophecies concerning that di&s;pen&s;ation of his grace. Finding them&s;elves in this manner &s;e|lected by God, and privileged above other nations, they would the more readily con|clude, that the Redeemer was de&s;igned for them alone. For preventing the mi&s;take, this early intimation that he was to be the Saviour of all nations, was highly proper: by many &s;ucceeding prophecies the &s;ame information was inculcated upon them. All this did not prevent their falling into the mi&s;take; but it rendered it inexcu&s;able.</P>
<P>BEFORE the Saviour came, they had per|&s;uaded them&s;elves, in oppo&s;ition to the infor|mation of all the prophets, that he was to be the temporal deliverer only of their nation. Had
<PB N="142" REF="147">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t been an impo&s;tor, he would have accommodated his preten&s;ions to their concep|tions; indeed he mu&s;t have been under the &s;ame prejudice; it could never have entered into his thoughts to form a de&s;ign totally repugnant to the notions which &s;o univer&s;ally and &s;o deeply po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all his countrymen. He &s;hewed him&s;elf to be no impo&s;tor, he &s;hewed him&s;elf to be the promi&s;ed Redeemer, by the very pre|ten&s;ions which he made. To the contracted notions of the Jews, they were diametrically oppo&s;ite; but they agreed exactly to the de|clarations of the prophets, and fulfilled them. He appeared, not as the deliverer of the Jews, but as the Saviour of the world: the angels proclaimed his birth to be <HI>good tidings of great joy, which &s;hould be unto all people</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 10.</NOTE>: in his life-time, he gave many intimations that he was intended for all nations: and after his re|&s;urrection, he expre&s;ly commanded his di&s;ciples to <HI>go into all the world, teach all nations,</HI> and <HI>preach the go&s;pel to every creature</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark xvi. 15. Matt. xxviii. 19.</NOTE>. They did &s;o: their own minds were purified from the prejudices of their nation; they &s;aw that the gentiles as well as the Jews had acce&s;s to &s;alvation and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s by faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; they <HI>perceived of a truth, that God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, but in</HI> EVERY NATION <HI>he</HI>

<P>FROM ob&s;erving that, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, calamities befall good and bad men indi&s;|criminately, the irreligious have concluded, that God takes no concern about the behaviour of men, and that <HI>is is</HI> therefore <HI>vain to &s;erve him</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. iii. 14.</NOTE>: and from ob&s;erving that a &s;trict adhe|rence to virtue is, in &s;ome ca&s;es, the direct cau&s;e of &s;uffering or lo&s;s, they have affected to conclude farther, that it is even folly to be virtuous. The great reward which God has promi&s;ed to good men in the future life, is doubtle&s;s &s;ufficient to render it our highe&s;t

wi&s;dom to adhere to virtue, whatever &s;uffer|ings it may bring upon us in the pre&s;ent life. But earthly things take &s;o fa&s;t an hold of the minds of men, that &s;ufferings for religion mu&s;t always have &s;ome tendency to prevent their looking forward to the heavenly reward, with faith firm enough to &s;u&s;tain their forti|tude, and &s;ecure their &s;ted&s;a&s;tne&s;s. On this ac|count the &s;cripture often calls &s;uch &s;ufferings, by way of eminence, <HI>temptations.</HI></P>
<P>IT is in the time of per&s;ecution chiefly, that men are expo&s;ed to temptations of this kind: but they are not totally exempt from them at any time. There will always be particular &s;ituations in which religion ob&s;tructs mens worldly intere&s;t; in which we may forfeit &s;ome immediate advantage, or incur &s;omething trouble&s;ome or di&s;agreeable, by inflexible and uncomplying virtue: and there will be many more &s;ituations, in which we may be appre|hen&s;ive of the&s;e con&s;equences. Though we be under no temptation to renounce our reli|gion altogether, we may be very &s;trongly tempted to what is incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;ome of its particular laws. Dread of incurring the ridicule of the world, the di&s;plea&s;ure of friends, the re&s;entment of the powerful, the lo&s;s of a favourable opportunity for gain, are often pleaded by men in every age, as ex|cu&s;es
<PB N="153" REF="157">
for acknowledged deviations from the &s;trict line of integrity and innocence. Never therefore can it be un&s;ea&s;onable to exhort Chri&s;tians to con&s;tancy in virtuous practice, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ufferings, lo&s;&s;es, and inconveniences in which it may involve them, or to urge upon them for this purpo&s;e, the &s;ame arguments which the &s;acred writers pro|po&s;ed, for the confirmation of the fir&s;t Chri&s;|tians enduring per&s;ecution for the &s;ake of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>IN this earthly &s;tate, all men without ex|ception are &s;ubjected to &s;uffering and affliction. Far from con&s;idering this as unfavourable to the cau&s;e of virtue or religion, the &s;acred wri|ters deduce from this very topic, an argument for re&s;olution, patience, and con&s;tancy under the peculiar &s;ufferings to which religion and virtue &s;ometimes expo&s;e good men. To &s;up|port the Chri&s;tians of that age under per&s;ecu|tion for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, they remind them, that all mankind, as well as they, are obnoxi|ous to many &s;ufferings. <HI>We know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, in for|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ying the Romans again&s;t <HI>the &s;ufferings of this pre&s;ent time</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">. 18.</NOTE>. The Corinthians al&s;o were in

danger of &s;uffering for religion. They dreaded that their refu&s;ing all communion with the Pa|gans in their idolatrous fea&s;ts, might provoke their re&s;entment and rai&s;e a per&s;ecution: per|haps they had experienced this in &s;ome degree. The go&s;pel notwith&s;tanding required them to per&s;i&s;t in their refu&s;al: compliance with any appendage of Pagan wor&s;hip, would have been an apo&s;ta&s;y from the faith of Chri&s;t, and from the &s;ervice of the one living God. The apo&s;|tle exhorts them to inflexible re&s;olution, <HI>let him that thinketh he &s;tandeth, take heed le&s;t he fall;</HI> and enforceth the exhortation by this argu|ment, <HI>there hath no temptation taken you, but &s;uch as is common to man.</HI> The &s;ufferings which you have incurred by your &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s, and all the &s;ufferings which by it you can in|cur, are only &s;uch as are ordinary in the life of man: therefore you ought to meet them with fortitude, to bear them with patience, and not allow your&s;elves to be moved by them to deviate from the purity of the go&s;pel in a point &s;o e&s;&s;ential. The force of the argument cannot but be felt, as &s;oon as it is propo&s;ed. Yet its impre&s;&s;ion may be &s;trengthened by its being deliberately unfolded, by our con&s;ider|ing attentively in what particular ways the common troubles of human life urge us to &s;ubmit chearfully to tho&s;e troubles which the good man may &s;ometimes incur by doing his

They urge us to this conduct, by the example of &s;uffering which they exhibit,&mdash;by leading us to conclude that, if we had not been expo&s;ed to &s;ufferings for virtue, other af|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">ctions would have been allotted to us,&mdash;by convincing us that by deviating from virtue we can obtain no &s;ecurity again&s;t falling into the like &s;ufferings,&mdash;and by &s;tamping vanity upon all pre&s;ent outward things.</P>
<P>FIRST, The afflictions and &s;orrows which are common, and even univer&s;al in human life, excite us to con&s;tancy under &s;ufferings for religion and a good con&s;cience, by the very example of &s;uffering which they exhibit.

<P>IF the generality pa&s;&s;ed through life with|out &s;eeing any evil days, you might have &s;ome excu&s;e for thinking it hard that you alone &s;hould be &s;ubjected to affliction, e&s;pecially that you &s;hould be &s;ubjected to it by a &s;trict adhe|rence to your duty.

our&s;elves to die like Chri&s;tians.

By the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, of which the go&s;pel a&s;&s;ures us, virtue is always in our own power: through the vanity of the world, all things earthly and temporal are in the power of innumerable accidents.

If by committing &s;in, if by &s;werving from &s;teady virtue, you could be certain to extricate your&s;elves from the fear of &s;uffering, yet the choice would be di&s;advantageous, pernicious, and ruinous.</P>
<P>IN every light, therefore, it is a powerful argument for con&s;tancy in religion, that it can expo&s;e us to no lo&s;s, hard&s;hip, or affliction,

<HEAD>SERMON VIII. THE OLD AGE OF THE RIGHTEOUS, HONOURABLE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PROV. xvi. 31.</BIBL>
<Q>The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is a ju&s;t aphori&s;m, and beautifully expre&s;&s;ed. Old age is, in a figurative and poetical manner, de&s;cribed by one of its concomitants, and by one which does not di|rectly imply any of its infirmities, but rather is in its very appearance venerable, <HI>the hoary head,</HI> the grey hairs. As hairs are an orna|ment to the head, the wi&s;e man, by an elegant allu&s;ion to them, calls old age <HI>a crown of glory,</HI> encircling the head, adorning it, and chal|lenging re&s;pect. Grey hairs indicate the de|cay of nature; but they are notwith&s;tanding an honourable crown, if the man who wears them, <HI>be found in the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The plain meaning of the maxim is, That the old
<PB N="186" REF="189">
age of good men is truly venerable, and entitles them to e&s;teem and honour.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall briefly il|lu&s;trate this maxim; and then deduce &s;ome practical reflections from it.</P>
<P>FIRST, I &s;hall illu&s;trate the maxim which Solomon delivers in the text, That good men, who have been allowed a long life, and have &s;pent it in piety and virtue, are honourable in their old age, de&s;erve, and even command e&s;teem.</P>
<P>NATURE it&s;elf intimates that reverence is due to old age, and has always, both in the rude&s;t and in the mo&s;t civilized nations, led men very gene|rally to give it reverence. When the young failed in re&s;pect to the old, or treated them with con|tempt, it has ever been con&s;idered as a certain mark of great degeneracy of manners. The wi&s;e men of all countries have acknowleged that years give one kind of <HI>&s;uperiority,</HI> and have inculcated reverence corre&s;pondent to it. To enforce the &s;ubjection of the younger to the elder, has been a part of the policy of all well regulated &s;tates; and in &s;ome &s;tates, this &s;ubjection has been carried very far, and in&s;i&s;ted upon in its utmo&s;t extent, as indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the order and pro&s;perity of &s;ociety.
<PB N="187" REF="190">
In the republic of I&s;rael, God made it the &s;ub|ject of an expre&s;s law; <HI>Thou &s;halt ri&s;e up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God; I am the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lev. xix. 32.</NOTE>. Elihu followed the dictates of nature and of decency, when he <HI>waited till Job and his three friends had &s;poken, becau&s;e they were elder than he</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job. xxxii. 4.</NOTE>; and he &s;poke the language of both, when he &s;aid, <HI>I am young, and ye are very old, wherefore I was afraid and dur&s;t not &s;how you mine opinion: I &s;aid, Days &s;hould &s;peak, and multitude of years &s;hould teach wi&s;dom</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 6, 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OLD age, thus venerable on its own ac|count, cannot fail to become much more ve|nerable when it is <HI>found in the way of righteou&s;|ne&s;s. The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xii. 26.</NOTE>. True goodne&s;s in the greate&s;t orna|ment of human nature; it is the propere&s;t ob|ject of approbation, and the ju&s;te&s;t foundation for e&s;teem; it entitles every per&s;on who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es it, to love and honour. It mu&s;t there|fore be a great ornament to old age, and render it truly re&s;pectable and venerable. When the reverence due to a character of true goodne&s;s, is added to the reverence due to old age, very high veneration mu&s;t be the re&s;ult.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="191">BUT for the more particular illu&s;tration of Solomon's maxim, for the fuller proof that the old age of the virtuous is honourable, let us con&s;ider their old age&mdash;in relation to the life which has preceded it,&mdash;in its own nature,&mdash;and in re&s;pect of the pro&s;pects which it opens.</P>
<P>1. THE old age of the virtuous is honour|able on account of the life which has preceded it. It is the termination of a wi&s;e, a well|&s;pent, and a u&s;eful life. Such a life was ho|nourable, and it reflects great glory on the per|&s;on who has accompli&s;hed it.</P>
<P>IN a religious and virtuous old man, we be|hold one who has long been expo&s;ed to the temptations of the world, and has overcome them. His virtues have been often put to the trial, and they have &s;tood the trial. Every period of human life has its peculiar difficulties; the man who entered early on a religious and virtuous cour&s;e, and went forward in it uni|formly to old age, has &s;urmounted all the&s;e difficulties. In a long life there never fail to be vici&s;&s;itudes of pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity, of joy and &s;orrow; it is honourable, through all the&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes, to have remained &s;tedfa&s;t in the love and practice of goodne&s;s. Sincere good|ne&s;s is always approved by God, who knows the heart: but goodne&s;s mu&s;t be tried, before
<PB N="189" REF="192">
its &s;incerity can be fully a&s;certained in the eyes of men. We ju&s;tly behold with plea&s;ure, the promi&s;ing beginnings of goodne&s;s in the young; but the mo&s;t promi&s;ing beginnings &s;ometimes fail, the blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">om is bla&s;ted, the fruit comes not to maturity: on this account, we can &s;carcely avoid mixing &s;ome degree of diffidence and re|&s;erve with our approbation of the virtues of the young. But the virtuous old man has fully approved him&s;elf to men, as well as to God; by many proofs he has rendered it unque&s;tion|able, that his goodne&s;s is true and genuine: we may proclaim his virtues with perfect con|fidence. Like a veteran, he has long encoun|tered all the dangers of the Chri&s;tian warfare; in many conflicts his re&s;olution has been di&s;play|ed, his &s;teadine&s;s manife&s;ted, and his invio|lable attachment to God and goodne&s;s ju&s;tified. His integrity is proved by the multitude of his triumphs; and they are triumphs full of the true&s;t glory.</P>
<P>BY trials, a man's virtue not only &s;hows it|&s;elf genuine, but al&s;o becomes confirmed, vi|gorous, and eminent. It is by exerci&s;e that every virtue is improved. The &s;ame temptations which endanger our virtues by their a&s;&s;aults, &s;trengthen them when they are re&s;i&s;ted. A long life contains many trials; and by every trial in which a man conquers, he is made bet|ter.
<PB N="190" REF="193">
If we devote our&s;elves to the practice of goodne&s;s in our earlie&s;t years, and then<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eforth per&s;i&s;t con&s;tantly in it, we mu&s;t make great progre&s;s before we reach old age. A virtuous old per&s;on is a per&s;on of improved and exalted goodne&s;s. All that honour and glory which belongs to goodne&s;s, he claims in its highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>AGAIN, A virtuous old age is the termina|tion of a life which has been filled up with worthy and u&s;eful actions. When a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">as begun early to do good, and lived to old ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> doing good, his &s;ervices to God and to man|kind mu&s;t be numerous. He has had many opportunities of virtuous practice; if he has carefully improved them, to what honour is he not intitled? Every day a good man lives, he has greater glory than he had the day b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|fore; for he has done greater good. A long life of piety and virtue has contained a great multitude of good actions; each of the&s;e ac|tions &s;ends forth a ray of glory, which is r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|flected back upon him who did it; and when all the &s;cattered rays are collected, and, as it were, twi&s;ted into a crown to encircle his hoary head, how glorious is that crown? With what lu&s;tre mu&s;t it &s;hine? How rich and how various an effulgence mu&s;t it diffu&s;e around him? The &s;parkling of the diamond is
<PB N="191" REF="194">
dimne&s;s in compari&s;on. The veneration due to virtuous old age, is the aggregate of all our approbations of the many virtuous and u&s;eful actions with which the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cedent life abound|ed; and this veneration is heightened and &s;weetened by the emotions of love and gratitude for the advantages which mankind have derived from &s;o long a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ries of good offices.</P>
<P>2. THE old age of the virtuous is honour|able in it&s;elf, as well as in its relation to their pa&s;t life.</P>
<P>THIS appears in &s;ome mea&s;ure from what has been already &s;aid. The character which a pious and virtuous old per&s;on exhibits to our view, is that of goodne&s;s, genuine, improved, and u&s;eful; of all characters the mo&s;t re&s;pect|able. This character was acquired by the conduct of the whole life, and therefore na|turally turns our eye backward to its cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e: but when we con&s;ider it as already formed, as now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in its maturity, and actuating the aged per&s;on in all his motions, it is, in it&s;elf, and without regard to the life which preceded it, a glorious ornament. In the earlier pe|riods of life, the tenour of a man's virtue is &s;ometimes interrupted, and its brightne&s;s tar|ni&s;hed, by the impetuo&s;ity of the pa&s;&s;ions, and the faults into which they precipitate him. Age
<PB N="192" REF="195">
calms the mind, frees it from turbulent and unruly pa&s;&s;ions, compo&s;es it into a holy &s;e|renity, and makes all the virtues of the heart to &s;hine forth, like the &s;un in the cleare&s;t day, unob&s;cured by the clouds of vice.</P>
<P>BUT not to enlarge on this, In old age, virtue is naturally accompanied by wi&s;dom and prudence, derived from long experience; and by its union with the&s;e, its lu&s;tre is aug|mented. <HI>Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ecclus. xxv. 6.</NOTE>. Ex|perience is the mo&s;t powerful teacher; in youth men mu&s;t be in a great mea&s;ure de&s;titute of its lights; and in con&s;equence of this, in &s;ome ca&s;es they mu&s;t be ignorant, and in other ca&s;es they mu&s;t misjudge: it is when they are ad|vanced in life, that their knowledge becomes exten&s;ive, their &s;entiments ju&s;t, and their maxims &s;olid. In early life, the violence of the pa&s;&s;ions often hurries men on ra&s;hly to ac|tion, without allowing them either lei&s;ure or inclination to li&s;ten to the voice of rea&s;on and the &s;ugge&s;tions of prudence. It is when years have rendered the pa&s;&s;ions le&s;s head&s;trong, and the judgment more mature, that rea&s;on is heard, and wi&s;dom acquired. In all the &s;a|vage nations the old men have, from a fixt
<PB N="193" REF="196">
opinion of their wi&s;dom, the greate&s;t weight in all public coun&s;els. The experience of age qualifies men for in&s;tructing, for advi&s;ing, for directing. When men are de&s;titute of piety and virtue, their experience is often only &s;kill|fulne&s;s in vice; all their wi&s;dom is but cun|ning, and their maxims but the rules of de|ceit; at the be&s;t, their prudence is confined to the things of this world. By communicat|ing their &s;entiments to the younger, if they do not corrupt them, they will in&s;truct them only in what regards their temporal intere&s;ts, and the conduct of civil life. But when a man has grown old in goodne&s;s, his maxims even for the pre&s;ent life are corrected, and his prudence &s;anctified, by religion: and his prudence is not confined to earthly things, his experience is great in religious matters like|wi&s;e; he has &s;piritual wi&s;dom, and is fit to lead others forward in the paths of righteou&s;|ne&s;s. He knows the various frailties of hu|man nature, for he has long experienced them; and he can pre&s;cribe the propere&s;t remedies for removing or alleviating them. He has had opportunity of ob&s;erving the &s;everal wiles of Satan, and deceits of &s;in; and is acquainted with the be&s;t defences again&s;t them. He has long &s;tudied the ways of God towards man; he under&s;tands the language of the various di&s;|pen&s;ations of Providence; and he can teach
<PB N="194" REF="197">
others how to improve them. He has learned the true value of things, and found the vanity of the world; and can check tho&s;e gay idea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;anguine hopes of youth, which, when they are indulged without any check, over|whelm men with bitter di&s;appointment. It is honourable for a man to be knowing in a u&s;eful bu&s;ine&s;s: the virtuous old man has the honour of being knowing in that bu&s;ine&s;s which is the mo&s;t important to every man. We re&s;pect tho&s;e who are able to direct and coun&s;el us: the aged &s;aint is able to direct and coun&s;el us in our chief concern, the improvement of our immortal &s;ouls: the re&s;pect which we owe him, is proportioned to the moment of this object.</P>
<P>IN old age, the &s;trength nece&s;&s;arily decays, the body becomes weak and feeble, infirmities are multiplied. It is only the mo&s;t worthle&s;s, or the mo&s;t thoughtle&s;s, that can on this ac|count de&s;pi&s;e an aged per&s;on. From all of other characters, the infirmities of age will command the tendere&s;t &s;ympathy; and this &s;ympathy, far from extingui&s;hing re&s;pect, will mix with it, &s;often its feelings, and make it to &s;hew its power by the mo&s;t attentive care to avoid whatever could give unea&s;ine&s;s to the aged per&s;on, and by the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous en|deavours to mitigate his di&s;tre&s;&s;es and promote his comfort. When the infirmities of age are
<PB N="195" REF="198">
ha&s;tened or increa&s;ed by a life of debauchery and vice, they do render a per&s;on de&s;picable: but the bodies of good men are worn out in the practice of virtue, in the &s;ervice of God and mankind, and the improvement of their own &s;ouls. Their infirmities them&s;elves are therefore honourable; they are like the wounds which the &s;oldier has received in fighting bravely for his country, and in which he glories. They lead us only to regret the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">railty of nature, which permits not the world longer to enjoy a de&s;erving man. When amid&s;t the infirmities of age, a per&s;on affects the levities, or betrays a remaining attachment to the impurities of youth, it is at once ridi|culous and &s;hocking; all re&s;pect vani&s;hes; we can &s;carcely help giving full &s;cope to indigna|tion and contempt: but his corruption, not his decrepitude, is the object of the&s;e &s;enti|ments; the contrary &s;entiments are tho&s;e which virtue in&s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">es. Under the infirmi|ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s of old age, no wonder that the vici|ous &s;ink: but they give the virtuous an op|portunity of &s;hewing the triumphs of religion and goodne&s;s, in a new and &s;triking light: a per&s;on &s;upporting the&s;e infirmities with pa|tience, amid&s;t them all pre&s;erving compo&s;ure, &s;erenity, and chearfulne&s;s,&mdash;is he more vene|rable, or more amiable?

po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing religion in &s;uch power, and exerting it with &s;uch &s;plendour.</P>
<P>THE old age of good men is honourable in re&s;pect of the pro&s;pects which attend it. The&s;e are the principal cau&s;es of that firmne&s;s and chearfulne&s;s under their infirmities, which, we have ju&s;t now &s;een, procures them reverence; and the&s;e reflect honour upon them in other ways.</P>
<P>OLD age is the termination of this mortal life; but to good men it is the immediate pre|lude to immortality.

<P>IT in&s;tructs the young in the duty which they owe to their elders.

proceeds from depravity of heart, and is at|tended with degeneracy of manners. It is to di&s;regard the order of nature, which gives pre-eminence to age; it is to find fault with age for wanting what the con&s;titution of things cannot permit it to have: <HI>the glory of young men is their &s;trength; but the beauty of old men is the grey head</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xx. 29.</NOTE>.

God thus trains us up in re&s;pect to our elders, and forms us in&s;en&s;ibly to that reverence which is due to old age, e&s;pecially when it is found adorned with piety and virtue: and he requires us to pay it this reverence. <HI>Ye younger, &s;ubmit your&s;elves unto the elder</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 5.</NOTE>, is the injunction of an in&s;pired apo&s;tle.

<P>BEFORE we enter on a more particular in|ve&s;tigation of the&s;e cau&s;es, it will be proper to premi&s;e one ob&s;ervation.

Yet it will be unavoidable often to &s;peak of them by names which imply approbation or di&s;approbation, e&s;pecially the latter. The rea&s;on is that, as all tempers are mo&s;t obvious in their exce&s;&s;es, and as &s;ome are very apt to run into exce&s;s, we have in many in&s;tances no name for the temper it&s;elf as di|&s;tingui&s;hed from the abu&s;e of it. We mu&s;t be on our guard again&s;t deception from this im|perfection of language, and endeavour, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to conceive every temper that &s;hall be mentioned, as in it&s;elf indifferent, however readily it may on the one hand degenerate into vice, or however ea&s;ily it may on the other hand be improved into virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="218">No man is altogether de&s;titute of any pa&s;|&s;ion or affection belonging to human nature: but no man has all his pa&s;&s;ions balanced again&s;t one another with perfect exactne&s;s; and no two men have them all proportioned to one another preci&s;ely in the &s;ame degree. Here is a fruitful &s;ource of varieties of temper. What|ever pa&s;&s;ion is predominant, gives a corre&s;pon|dent ca&s;t to the whole &s;oul, and produces a &s;uit|able complexion.</P>
<P>SOME of our pa&s;&s;ions and affections are mo&s;t directly &s;ub&s;ervient to our own private in|tere&s;t; and &s;ome of them have other men for their objects: when tho&s;e of the former &s;ort prevail, the temper will be &s;elfi&s;h and con|tracted; when tho&s;e of the latter cla&s;s are pre|dominant, the temper will be open and &s;ocial. Many di&s;tinct affections belong to each of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es; and every affection belonging to either of them, produces a turn of temper congruous to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>WE daily meet with characters, both good and bad, which are founded in, and derive their peculiar complexion from an original and natural turn to tho&s;e affections, whether &s;enti|ments or de&s;ires, which are properly &s;elfi&s;h. Some, for in&s;tance, are prone to pride; it a&s;|&s;umes very different forms according to the
<PB N="217" REF="219">
cau&s;es by which it is produced, and the ex|pre&s;&s;ions to which it mo&s;t directly tends; and every form of it gives ri&s;e to a corre&s;pondent particularity of temper: hence the &s;tately, the haughty, the arrogant, the in&s;olent, the con|ceited, the vain, the dignified turn of mind, and many others, which language cannot mark with preci&s;ion, but which the di&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rning eye readily di&s;tingui&s;hes when they occur in the commerce of the world. Tempers as various, take their ri&s;e from an oppo&s;ite propen&s;ity of &s;oul to humility. A love of honours, power, preheminence, di&s;tinction, forms the temper of &s;ome; indifference about all the&s;e, is a &s;triking feature in other characters. A high reli&s;h and a great fondne&s;s for what is plea&s;ant, forms the ba&s;is of &s;ome characters; and in&s;en|&s;ibility to the impre&s;&s;ions of plea&s;ure, that of others. Some men are naturally turned to the love of riches, others to the neglect of them.</P>
<P>WHEN the malevolent pa&s;&s;ions have a ten|dency to predominate in the &s;oul, they occa&s;ion all tho&s;e diver&s;ities of temper, to which we ap|ply the epithets, &s;our, &s;ullen, moro&s;e, &s;evere, captious, peevi&s;h, pa&s;&s;ionate, ill-humoured, and the like.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, the prevalence of the be|nevolent and kind affections of the heart, pro|duces

a great variety of tempers, &s;ome of which we term the &s;weet, the gentle, the mild, the &s;oft, the courteous, the tender, the &s;ympa|thi&s;ing, the affectionate, the generous.</P>
<P>EVERY affection a&s;&s;umes different forms, according to the different &s;ituations in which its object is placed; it exerts it&s;elf in de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, in hope or fear, in joy or &s;orrow: but every man has not, by his con&s;titution, an equal propen&s;ity to all the&s;e exertions of affec|tion. Some are prone to de&s;ire; this renders them naturally keen, eager, or enterpri&s;ing, and apt to become anxious and &s;olicitous: others are more turned to aver&s;ion, and in con&s;e|quence of this are naturally cautious, wary, circum&s;pect, and liable to care, fretfulne&s;s, and di&s;gu&s;t. Hope is predominant in &s;ome men, and fear in others: the former produces a tem|per of elation, confidence, and greater enter|pri&s;e than would have ari&s;en from the preva|lence of de&s;ire alone: the latter produces a temper, cowardly, timid, dejected, &s;u&s;picious, or foreboding. There is not perhaps any af|fection in the operation of which the oppo&s;ite tempers now mentioned, may be &s;een more &s;trongly contra&s;ted, than the love of money: in one per&s;on, this principle &s;hows it&s;elf by pu&s;hing for great advantages, embarking in exten&s;ive undertakings, and running every ri&s;k

This difference accounts, in &s;ome degree, for a diver|&s;ity of character which we may often ob&s;erve: there are per&s;ons who have borne ob&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">urity, po|verty, and even affliction, with great com|po&s;ure and equanimity, but have been exce&s;|&s;ively elated and di&s;&s;ipated by pro&s;perity; their natural chearfulne&s;s relieved the former, but being encouraged by the latter, ran into an extreme: on the other hand, there are per&s;ons who can bear pro&s;perity with great moderation, but are perfectly &s;unk by adver&s;ity; their na|tural propen&s;ity is to &s;orrow; when it is irri|tated by di&s;tre&s;s, it overwhelms them: when

<P>THUS all the affections and pa&s;&s;ions, ac|cording as one or another of them is predo|minant, tinge the whole &s;oul with their own peculiar hue.</P>
<P>WE may ob&s;erve farther, that very great diver&s;ities of temper may proceed from the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion, only by its being predominant in different manners. The pa&s;&s;ionate temper, and the peevi&s;h, are extremely different; yet they both proceed from the predominance of the very &s;ame principle, &s;udden anger. Deliberate anger produces in tho&s;e who have a propen&s;ity to it, many di&s;tinctions of temper unlike to both the&s;e. Whatever be the varieties of which any pa&s;&s;ion is &s;u&s;ceptible in re&s;pect of its cau&s;es, its objects, its feeling, or its tendencies, the temper founded in that pa&s;&s;ion will be &s;u&s;cep|tible of all the &s;ame varieties.</P>
<P>IT may be remarked likewi&s;e, that &s;ome tempers proceed from the weakne&s;s of a parti|cular di&s;po&s;ition, more properly than from a predominance of the contrary. Courage, &s;o far as it is con&s;titutional, proceeds merely from the ab&s;ence of fear. Impudence is not the prevalence of any po&s;itive affection, but only
<PB N="221" REF="223">
the want of &s;hame. A re&s;erved temper, at lea&s;t in many in&s;tances, belongs to this head; the per&s;on is not actuated by tho&s;e principles which lead others to a free communication of their &s;entiments and de&s;igns. That a di&s;tinc|tion of temper &s;hould ari&s;e from a defect in one mental principle, cannot be &s;urpri&s;ing: &s;ome vices are altogether negative, they con&s;i&s;t not in any bad affection, they indicate only the want of a good one; &s;ome virtues, in like manner, are not po&s;itive exertions of laudable affections, but ari&s;e from the re&s;traint and pro|per government of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions as tend to vice. The human &s;oul is a complicated ma|chine; its &s;tate and character are not determined by any one part of it, but re&s;ult from the balancings, the relations, and the harmonious adju&s;tment of all the parts. A want or a re|lative weakne&s;s in any one of the numerous parts of a clock, affects the &s;oundne&s;s of the whole machine.</P>
<P>THIS principle &s;ugge&s;ts another ob&s;erva|tion. The &s;everal pa&s;&s;ions and affections are, in different men, combined in an infinite va|riety of ways; and every particular combina|tion of them produces a di&s;tinct temper. Per|haps every temper, when it is analy&s;ed with the utmo&s;t accuracy, will be found, not to ari&s;e from the prevalence of a &s;ingle affection,
<PB N="222" REF="224">
but to derive its form in &s;ome degree from the union of &s;everal. Thus in a compounded co|lour, different ingredients are mixed, and may be ob&s;erved on attention; though one be &s;o much predominant as to give it its common denomination. Thus fainter traces of &s;everal di&s;po&s;itions, are often di&s;cernible in a counte|nance, which yet receives its principal expre&s;|&s;ion and general form from one affection. But in &s;ome tempers, the union of different prin|ciples is more obvious, and their influence more equal, than in others. To produce a temper turned to ridicule, both a prevalence of the malevolent pa&s;&s;ions, and a propen&s;ity to chearfulne&s;s, mu&s;t concur; without the latter, the temper would lead to mere invective and bitter railing. The united prevalence of joy and benevolent affection, forms a peculiarity of temper, different from what would re&s;ult from the prevalence of either of the&s;e alone: if there be any of your acquaintance marked with this amiable peculiarity, you will know it by finding their mirth con&s;tantly intended to promote your plea&s;ure, and by a winning readine&s;s and alacrity accompanying all their good offices. In a mode&s;t temper, humility and a &s;en&s;e of propriety meet in almo&s;t equal mea&s;ures. Affability is a temper which can|not be formed but by the union of many &s;enti|ments and affections which will be ea&s;ily di&s;|covered
<PB N="223" REF="225">
by attention to its appearances and ex|ertions. Some affections are apter to mingle together into one temper, than others: but no affections are &s;o oppo&s;ite as not &s;ometimes to be conjoined, to mitigate the contrarieties of each other, and then to be blended into one turn of &s;oul. Hence ari&s;e tho&s;e heterogeneous and ab&s;urd bia&s;&s;es which we now and then meet with, and wonder at as &s;ingularities.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e ways, the predominance of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ions and affections, or of others, is a &s;ource of many varieties of temper; of more indeed than language has di&s;tinct names for expre&s;&s;ing, though we can di&s;cern each of them, when we meet with it in life.</P>
<P>BUT it is not only by the prevalence of &s;ome of them in compari&s;on with the re&s;t, that the pa&s;&s;ions produce diver&s;ities of temper among mankind: the general tone al&s;o of all the pa&s;&s;ions occa&s;ions a &s;uitable peculiarity. A mu&s;ical in&s;trument acquires different tones by having all its &s;trings wound up to different keys. The pa&s;&s;ions of different per&s;ons are as it were wound up to a variety of keys, and thence their &s;ouls de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ive di&s;tinct tones of tem|per. In &s;ome men, all the pa&s;&s;ions are high and &s;trong, bri&s;k and lively. Had the&s;e men no one pa&s;&s;ion more dominant than the re&s;t,
<PB N="224" REF="226">
this general vivacity of the pa&s;&s;ions would produce a peculiarity of temper congruous to it&s;elf. It is the cau&s;e of tho&s;e di&s;tinctions of temper which can be characterized by &s;en&s;ibi|lity, ardour, activity, vehemence, violence, impetuo&s;ity. In other men, all the pa&s;&s;ions are weak and languid. This renders the tem|per, in a degree proportioned to their dullne&s;s, in&s;en&s;ible, in&s;ipid, &s;luggi&s;h, indolent, cool, or compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>IN order to perceive in its full extent the influence of the general tone of the pa&s;&s;ions on the formation of the temper, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve that it may be combined with any predomi|nant pa&s;&s;ion. Whatever peculiarity of temper a per&s;on derives from the prevalence of one pa&s;&s;ion, a high tone of all the pa&s;&s;ions will render more &s;triking and more &s;trongly marked, than it would have otherwi&s;e been. It is in men of warm pa&s;&s;ions, that the natu|ral temper &s;hows it&s;elf with the greate&s;t force, and mo&s;t preci&s;ely di&s;criminated from all other turns of mind. When the pa&s;&s;ions are feeble, the temper of the &s;oul, whatever be the pa&s;&s;ion of which it holds, may be compared to tho&s;e faces, which having little characteri&s;tical or di&s;tinctive, the painter finds difficulty in tak|ing off. The tone of the pa&s;&s;ions admits many gradations; it is the immediate cau&s;e of as
<PB N="225" REF="227">
many particularities of temper: every grada|tion of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible, may be united with any one predominant pa&s;&s;ion; and every different conjunction will occa&s;ion a new ca&s;t of mind. Tempers ari&s;ing from the predomi|nance of the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion, are, in many in|&s;tances, &s;o much diver&s;ified by the tone of the pa&s;&s;ions, as to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, even in com|mon language, by peculiar names. The joy|ous temper is di&s;tinct from the chearful; the affectionate from the gentle; the prevailing pa&s;&s;ion is the &s;ame, but its tone is different.</P>
<P>THOUGH the pa&s;&s;ions be the mo&s;t imme|diate cau&s;es of the varieties of temper, and though on that account they required our fir&s;t and principal notice in explaining the&s;e varieties, yet it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, not only that the under&s;tanding has &s;ome influence on every pe|culiarity of temper, but al&s;o that &s;ome peculi|arities of it cannot be at all explained without taking into the account, the turn and degree of the under&s;tanding; nay, that &s;ome peculiari|ties of temper are occa&s;ioned almo&s;t wholly by the form of the intellectual powers. Some men have a propen&s;ity to ob&s;erve accurately, without any formed de&s;ign, whatever comes in their way; this propen&s;ity lays the founda|tion of an attentive turn: the habit of ob&s;erv|ing things confirms that turn: a heedle&s;s tem|per
<PB N="226" REF="228">
ari&s;es from the want of this propen&s;ity. Some men can ea&s;ily remove their attention from one object, and immediately employ it with as great clo&s;ene&s;s on another; &s;ome can|not readily di&s;engage their thoughts from what has once engro&s;&s;ed them: the influence of the&s;e oppo&s;ite ca&s;ts of under&s;tanding, on the temper, is very con&s;picuous: in the man who can ob&s;erve all the proprieties of quickly varying &s;ituations, in the man who can adapt him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to di&s;&s;imilar companies, or in the man who can apply without di&s;traction and with equal ardor to a multiplicity of oc|cupations, you &s;ee the operation of the for|mer; and you will as clearly perceive the ope|ration of the latter in the contrary characters, which frequently occur in great variety, Some men have rea&s;oning minds; whatever object is before them, they place it in every attitude, they view it in every light, they in|ve&s;tigate all its con&s;equences: this turn of un|der&s;tanding lays the foundation of a con&s;iderate, provident temper; the contrary turn, of a thoughtle&s;s, ra&s;h, improvident temper. There is a credulous, and there is a &s;ceptical temper; they are founded in oppo&s;ite turns of under|&s;tanding: but the&s;e oppo&s;ite turns generally imply the &s;ame intellectual weakne&s;s, an in|capacity of perceiving the force of evidence quickly and preci&s;ely: this incapacity leads
<PB N="227" REF="229">
one man to admit all the evidence that is pro|po&s;ed to him, by hindering him from per|ceiving its defects; and it leads another to re|ject all the evidence that is offered, by render|ing him in&s;en&s;ible of its &s;trength. On this account, what we often remark as &s;urpri&s;ing and unaccountable, that credulity and incre|dulity are found in the &s;ame characters, both in very high degrees, that the greate&s;t &s;cep|tics and infidels on &s;ome &s;ubjects, &s;how the weake&s;t ea&s;ine&s;s of faith on others, is natural, and even unavoidable. A &s;ound di&s;cernment of the real force of evidence would prevent both extremes. When the under&s;tanding is clear and deci&s;ive, it lays the foundation of a firm and determined temper: an inability to form a clear opinion, produces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">icklene&s;s and incon&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>FOR explaining the variety of tempers, it will be proper to make another ob&s;ervation. The &s;ame temper may, in different men, pro|ceed from different cau&s;es. It was formerly ob&s;erved that &s;ome men are compo&s;ed in ad|ver&s;ity, but elated by pro&s;perity, and others moderate in pro&s;perity, but dejected by adver|&s;ity, and that the difference may often be ac|counted for, from the predominance of chear|fulne&s;s in the former, and of &s;orrow in the latter: when it proceeds from this cau&s;e, the
<PB N="228" REF="230">
elation of the former &s;hows it&s;elf in giddine&s;s and levity, and the dejection of the latter, in melancholy. But the difference proceeds in many in&s;tances from another cau&s;e: when pride is predominant in the con&s;titution, ad|ver&s;ity may be no more than it requires to check, to moderate, and to re&s;train it within proper bounds; pro&s;perity inflames it, and gives it &s;cope in in&s;olence and arrogance: on the contrary, when there is a &s;trong propen|&s;ity to humility, it may need pro&s;perity to counteract it; adver&s;ity &s;inks it into depre&s;&s;ion, meanne&s;s, or pu&s;illanimity. In &s;ome in&s;tances both cau&s;es operate, and impre&s;s on the cha|racter traces &s;uitable to each. Eagerne&s;s of temper may ari&s;e from a great predominance of one pa&s;&s;ion, or it may ari&s;e from a high tone of all the pa&s;&s;ions. A grave temper we &s;hould at fir&s;t &s;ight be apt to impute, in every in&s;tance, to the want of a propen&s;ity to joy; yet it is often found without any predominance of &s;orrow: in &s;ome ca&s;es it proceeds from a moderate tone of all the pa&s;&s;ions, in others from a thoughtful, con&s;iderate turn of mind; there are ca&s;es in which it has cau&s;es different from all the&s;e. One cau&s;e of a re&s;erved tem|per was mentioned already, the want of tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions which lead men to communicate their &s;entiments: but it may proceed from very different principles, from mode&s;ty, for
<PB N="229" REF="231">
in&s;tance, or from &s;u&s;piciou&s;ne&s;s, or from &s;ul|lenne&s;s, or from pride. The &s;ource of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ic|klene&s;s and incon&s;tancy is &s;ometimes weak|ne&s;s of judgment; &s;ometimes timidity; and &s;ometimes the keenne&s;s of all the pa&s;|&s;ions, hurrying a man continually into new pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uits according as they happen to be ex|cited in their turns. A temper of ra&s;hne&s;s and precipitation may proceed from an impro|vident judgment, from the ab&s;ence of fear and caution, or from the violence of any pa&s;&s;ion. But &s;till, though tempers thus proceeding from different cau&s;es, are often &s;o &s;imilar as to come under the &s;ame common denomina|tion, yet they are not preci&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly the &s;ame. They are confounded by the generality, but a judicious eye can di&s;tingui&s;h them. They are like tho&s;e faces which have a &s;trong re&s;em|blance in their general ca&s;t, but differ con&s;i|derably in their particular features. There is a peculiarity in each, congruous to its own cau&s;e. To di&s;cern this peculiarity, and to perceive the cau&s;e from which it is derived, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for our forming a right judgment concerning a per&s;on's temper. When the cau&s;es of &s;imilar tempers are very analo|gous, the di&s;tinction of the&s;e tempers may be very delicate, and will require great acutene&s;s to perceive it. But it is often obvious enough; &s;imilar tempers &s;ometimes ari&s;e from
<PB N="230" REF="232">
very unlike cau&s;es, nay from &s;uch as are op|po&s;ite; when they do, the dulle&s;t can di&s;cri|minate them: a temper of firmne&s;s ari&s;es from a clear perception of the rea&s;ons of a cer|tain conduct; ob&s;tinacy may ari&s;e from an in|capacity of perceiving the&s;e rea&s;ons; both im|ply con&s;tancy; but none will be at a lo&s;s to di&s;cern the difference between them. Gene|rally, however, the principles which produce &s;imilar tempers, have &s;ome analogy, &s;ome fit|ne&s;s to coale&s;ce. When they have, &s;ome de|gree of them all often appears in the temper, though a greater degree of one of them gives it the predominant tinge.</P>
<P>As &s;imilar tempers may proceed from di&s;&s;i|milar cau&s;es, &s;o even oppo&s;ite tempers may proceed from the &s;ame cau&s;e. Under a former head, we have already found an example of this; we have found the &s;ceptical temper, and the credulous, ultimately re&s;olved into the &s;ame imbecility of under&s;tanding, an inability of clearly di&s;cerning the real force of evidence. This inability likewi&s;e gives ri&s;e to an ob&s;ti|nate temper in &s;ome, to a wavering temper in others: one is immoveable in all his de&s;igns, becau&s;e he is incapable of di&s;cerning the &s;trength of tho&s;e rea&s;ons which &s;hould per|&s;uade him to alter them; another is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ickle in them all, becau&s;e he cannot &s;ee the weakne&s;s

<P>SUCH are the general cau&s;es of the diver|&s;ity of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rs among mankind.

<P>2. A PROPER &s;en&s;e of the endle&s;s variety of tempers in the human &s;pecies, would lead us to make greater allowance for the &s;entiments and conduct of others, than we often do. To our&s;elves we often arrogate indulgence, on ac|count of our peculiar temper, much greater than can be rea&s;onable: to others, we generally give no indulgence on account of the peculia|rity of tempers. Did we con&s;ider, how dif|ficult it is to govern the natural temper, did we reflect how imperfectly we often govern our own, and how often it betrays us into what is faulty; and were we at the &s;ame time di&s;po&s;ed to judge and to act equitably with re|&s;pect to others; we could not fail to make great allowances even for the real faults into which their temper leads them. Great as they may be in the &s;ight of God, our judgment of them &s;hould be mild, and our conduct in con|&s;equence of them, indulgent and forbearing; we may find in our&s;elves, &s;ometimes an excu&s;e for them, always an extenuation of them. But
<PB N="235" REF="237">
we, on the contrary, often form an unfavour|able opinion of others, entertain hatred of them, or treat them ill, merely for &s;uch differences in their natural temper as are really free from vice. The grave and the melancholy are apt to reckon the mo&s;t innocent chearfulne&s;s and mirth profane and ungodly. The gay and chearful too readily charge the &s;erious with grimace and hypocri&s;y. The man of openne&s;s &s;huns him who is naturally re&s;erved, as art|ful, cunning, and de&s;igning. Examples might ea&s;ily be multiplied.

Would you find fault with others, becau&s;e the features of their faces are not the &s;ame with tho&s;e of your own? The tempers of men are as various as their faces; they can no more eradicate the peculiarity of their tempers, than de&s;troy the di&s;tinction of their looks. They cannot but do the very &s;ame action in different manners. By atten|tion to this one principle, how many dif|ferences, animo&s;ities, di&s;likes, mi&s;con&s;tructions, and ill offices would be prevented among men? how much would the virtues of forbearance, candour, and mutual love, be promoted?</P>

<HEAD>SERMON X. THE NECESSITY OF GOVERNING THE NATURAL TEMPER.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PROV. xxv. 28.</BIBL>
<Q>He that hath no rule over his own &s;pirit, is like a city that is broken down and without walls.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, I explained the origin and the nature of the variety of tempers which is found among mankind. In this di&s;|cour&s;e, I propo&s;e to evince the nece&s;&s;ity of our governing, each his own peculiar temper.</P>
<P>Is it, then, needful to evince the nece&s;&s;ity of a man's governing his own temper? Every man acknowledges that all others ought to govern their tempers, and complains of them when they do not. By this, every man ac|knowledges that the government of the temper is a duty of indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation. Yet there is very great need to enforce it; for every man almo&s;t pleads a privilege to neglect it in his
<PB N="238" REF="240">
own particular ca&s;e. As long as men do this, it never will be practi&s;ed. It is not our own|ing a duty to be incumbent upon others, but our perceiving it to be incumbent upon our|&s;elves, that will lead us to the performance of it. That we may perceive, how much it is the duty of every one of us, to govern his own temper, let us attend to the ill effects of neglecting to govern it. They are pointed out by an expre&s;&s;ive figure in the text: <HI>He that hath no rule over his own &s;pirit, is like a city that is broken down and without walls;</HI> he has no &s;ecurity again&s;t abandoning him&s;elf to every vice. This is an alarming motive to the government of the temper. If the neglect of it has any tendency to vice, it mu&s;t have a very &s;trong tendency. The influence of our particular temper runs through our whole life&punc; and mixes with every action of it; the con&s;e|quences of an ungoverned temper mu&s;t there|fore be very exten&s;ive; the whole of our con|duct mu&s;t be vitiated. This ob&s;ervation &s;ets the importance of governing the temper in a very &s;triking light; if it be at all a duty, it is a momentous duty. For evincing that it is a duty, it will be &s;ufficient to &s;how, that the neglect of it leads to vice; and in &s;howing this with the fulle&s;t evidence, there will be little difficulty.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="241">EVERY natural temper is innocent in it&s;elf; it may likewi&s;e be made conducive to virtue: but every temper is, at the &s;ame time, apt to degenerate into &s;ome vice. To make the tem|per &s;ub&s;ervient to virtue, or even to pre&s;erve it innocent, attention, and care in re&s;training and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">odelling it, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; ju&s;t as the &s;oil requires culture in order to its pro|ducing a crop of u&s;eful grain: but as the ground, whenever it is not cultivated, runs into wildne&s;s, and nouri&s;hes u&s;ele&s;s or noxious weeds; &s;o, that our natural temper may lead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s into the vices &s;uited to it, and occa&s;ion us all the mi&s;ery involved in them, nothing is nece&s;&s;ary but to leave it to it&s;elf, to neglect to rule it. Our becoming abandoned to <HI>the&s;e</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ices at lea&s;t, is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the neglect.

<P>THERE is not a &s;ingle vice to which &s;ome turn of temper does not directly tend; and therefore there is not a &s;ingle vice into which one man or another will not be led, by neg|lecting to govern his natural temper.

the human &s;pecies. Some have been led by particular cau&s;es, into cour&s;es of vice, from which their natural temper was abhor|rent; but the greate&s;t part addict them&s;elves to the vices which mo&s;t fall in with it. There is &s;ome vice which ea&s;ily falls in with every turn of temper, and unavoidably ari&s;es from the indulgence of it.</P>
<P>NEED I point out minutely, the vices to which the indulgence of a contracted and &s;elfi&s;h temper naturally leads? Will it not be readily acknowledged by all, that vice is the certain con&s;equence of the indulgence? It will be only difficult for the generality to form a con|ception of a contracted temper &s;o carefully cor|rected as not to include vice in the very idea of it. Selfi&s;hne&s;s is a term which we never u&s;e in a favourable &s;en&s;e; a certain proof that a propen&s;ity to it is very apt to become vicious. The &s;elfi&s;h affections are various; they turn to different objects: but it requires the &s;tricte&s;t government to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">vent a temper founded on the prevalence of any of them, from degenerat|ing into the corre&s;pondent vice, ambition, or vanity, or avarice, or &s;en&s;uality and the love of plea&s;ure. The&s;e are all the names of vices, and of vices which, when they ri&s;e to a great height, and are indulged without controul, render the characters dete&s;table, in which they
<PB N="241" REF="243">
are the leading principles. We regard <HI>prid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> with a &s;omewhat le&s;s unfavourable eye, than any of the &s;elfi&s;h <HI>de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ires;</HI> we allow that there are &s;pecies of it which are innocent, or even virtuous; but &s;ome epithet mu&s;t be applied to mark them: it is an affection &s;o apt to become vicious, and &s;o frequently found in a faulty form, that pride without an epithet always denotes a vice. To its exce&s;&s;es, names are ap|propriated, expre&s;&s;ive of the greate&s;t ba&s;ene&s;s. A man naturally turned to pride, without go|verning his temper, becomes haughty, or ar|rogant, or in&s;olent. One &s;uperciliou&s;ly d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pi&s;es tho&s;e with whom he lives; the &s;tateline&s;s of his carriage proclaims how much he r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ckons them below him; he di&s;dains to take notice of them. Another is perpetually claiming ex|travagant re&s;pect; he is not &s;atisfied with his own opinion of his &s;uperiority; he demands that you &s;hould own it; he anxiou&s;ly di&s;plays it; he makes a &s;how of his riches before the poor man, and of his pomp before the mean; if you refu&s;e him homage, if you yield it in any degree of moderation, you a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters">nt him, and he becomes your enemy. One affects affa|bility and lowline&s;s, but he forces you to fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l that he thinks he is conde&s;cending very far in treating you as his equal. Another is over|bearing, he reckons you much his inferior, he thinks you dependent upon him, perhaps he
<PB N="242" REF="244">
&s;tudies to render you dependent, at any rate he treats you as if you were, he mortifies you with all the petulance of in&s;ult. Such cha|racters are dete&s;table; and they ari&s;e infallibly from ungoverned pride. Even humility, of all the private affections the mo&s;t approveable, if it predominated in the temper, and were put under no regulation, would &s;ink into a feeble, a mean, and an abject &s;pirit, which is blame|able in it&s;elf, and chills every great and worthy effort of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>IT is &s;till le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to enter into a long detail of the dete&s;table vices which &s;pring from a temper founded in a propen&s;ity to any of the malevolent pa&s;&s;ions. It will univer&s;ally be confe&s;&s;ed that &s;uch tempers, if not very car|fully corrected, mu&s;t produce characters de|&s;ervedly odious. They lead to vices which &s;pread mi&s;ery through &s;ociety, and which over|whelm the per&s;on him&s;elf with greater mi&s;ery than he brings upon tho&s;e around him. Ha|bitual peevi&s;hne&s;s, producing fretfulne&s;s on every the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ion, putting one out of humour with every per&s;on and every thing, creating ince&s;&s;ant unea&s;ine&s;s to tho&s;e who are connected with him, eating out the enjoyment of life, is the natural effect of a temper founded on a propen&s;ity to anger, though accompanied with the weake&s;t tone of pa&s;&s;ion. The &s;ame
<PB N="243" REF="245">
propen&s;ity joined to a higher tone of pa&s;&s;ion, leads to vices of a &s;till more pernicious tendency, to licentious reproaches, extravagant menaces, vehemence, rage, and fury; it hara&s;&s;es infe|riors and dependents, it provokes and alien|ates the deare&s;t friends, it &s;tains conver&s;ation with rudene&s;s and brutality, in a moment it precipitates into injuries which can never be repaired, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d into crimes which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ntail bitter repentance on the whole &s;ucceeding part of life. But when the propen&s;ity is, not to &s;hort fits of pa&s;&s;ion frequently recurring, but to perma|nent and deliberate anger, the indulgence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> produces the blacke&s;t vices: it renders the whole behaviour captious and perver&s;e, it in|fects every action with har&s;hne&s;s and bitterne&s;s, it &s;ettles into malice, it grows up into envy, it exerts it&s;elf in revenge, it breaks forth into rancour, it degenerates into cruelty, it employs power in creating mi&s;ery and &s;preading de&s;o|lation, it takes occa&s;ion even from religion for per&s;ecution and bloody ma&s;&s;acre.</P>
<P>BUT alas, even tho&s;e be&s;t of tempers in which the kind affections prevail, will be pro|ductive of very de&s;tructive vices, if they are not governed with care. Every day we meet with per&s;ons who have become vicious by in|dulging a temper of this kind. One man is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ociable; he indulges his love of company,
<PB N="244" REF="246">
and he becomes di&s;&s;ipated, and neglects every material duty of life; he falls into ill com|pany, and he is corrupted. Another is &s;oft in his nature, and cannot bear to di&s;oblige; he falls in with vicious men, to oblige them he grants whatever they are plea&s;ed to a&s;k, he con&s;ents to what he knows to be wrong, he &s;inneth with them. Good nature, it is even commonly ob&s;erved, expo&s;es a per&s;on to dan|gerous temptations. A &s;ympathizing temper often degenerates into weakne&s;&s;es greatly blame|able: genero&s;ity of temper readily &s;hoots up into prodigality and ruinous extravagance: and the warm and affectionate heart needs to be held in with a &s;teady rein, el&s;e it will ru&s;h for|ward into unlawful te&s;timonies of kindne&s;s, and unrighteous acts of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>IN whatever way our temper mo&s;t di&s;po&s;es the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ions and affections to exert them|&s;elves, it will, without regulation, prove the &s;ource of peculiar vices. When the propen|&s;ity to de&s;ire renders the temper ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n and eager, if we lay it under no re&s;traint, if we be not at pains both to direct it to proper objects, and to moderate the degree of it, it mu&s;t engage us in trifling and vicious pur&s;uits; in re&s;pect of the object of our pur&s;uit, whether plea&s;ure, profit, or power, it mu&s;t render us craving and in&s;atiable, ever un&s;atisfied with what we
<PB N="245" REF="247">
have obtained, wi&s;hing and plotting for more; and in re&s;pect of the means of pro&s;ecution, it mu&s;t render us impetuous and violent, re|gardle&s;s of the bounds of right, impatient of every delay and oppo&s;ition; we &s;hall fret and rage at the di&s;appointment of wi&s;hes which ought never to have been formed, and the inefficacy of means which ought never to have been employed. Is the oppo&s;ite pro|pen&s;ity to aver&s;ion indulged? Every thing wears a gloomy a&s;pect, and is viewed on its darke&s;t &s;ide: we act as if we were re&s;olved ne|ver to be plea&s;ed; we &s;earch for occa&s;ions of di&s;gu&s;t, regret, and unea&s;ine&s;s, and we find them in every object; every gentle affection is bani&s;hed from the brea&s;t; di&s;content, fretful|ne&s;s, and ill humour become habitual. A temper of confidence ea&s;ily degenerates into pre|&s;umption; it engages a man in impracticable enterpri&s;es, and makes him &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s in them; it makes him look on impo&s;&s;ibilities as merely difficulties; he hopes, and he &s;trains every nerve to overcome them, he attempts even the mo&s;t unlawful means; he is plunged into di&s;appointment when he lea&s;t thinks of it, hurried into all the vices which di&s;appoint|ment produces in the &s;anguine, and over|whelmed with angui&s;h proportioned to the ele|vation of his former hopes. Another gives full &s;cope to the timidity of his natural di&s;po|&s;ition;
<PB N="246" REF="248">
he dares not attempt any thing that is worthy, the &s;lighte&s;t danger can terrify him into the ba&s;e&s;t conduct; he falls into all the &s;ins and into all the mi&s;eries which belong to the cowardly, the &s;u&s;picious, the jealous, the cunning, the de&s;ponding. The &s;orrowful ca&s;t of mind, become exce&s;&s;ive, renders even a man's virtues forbidding, and di&s;po&s;es him to vices which can only torment him. A chearful temper is amiable: but when it is ungoverned, it is the &s;ource of many vicious characters; the man who abandons him&s;elf to di&s;&s;olute mirth and jollity, without regard to the propriety of &s;ub|jects or of &s;ituations; the per&s;on who trifles in uncea&s;ing levity, incapable of &s;erious thought or of a moment's &s;edate behaviour; the in&s;ig|nificant, fluttering in a continual round of gay amu&s;ements, at lei&s;ure for none of the duties of life; the wretch who runs from plea&s;ure to plea&s;ure, and gives him&s;elf up to fal&s;e and riotous joys; all the&s;e characters and many more, &s;pring in a great mea&s;ure from chear|fulne&s;s of temper indulged without controul.</P>
<P>WHEN the general tone of the pa&s;&s;ions is high, it expo&s;es a man to all the vices in their turn, which can ari&s;e from the exce&s;s of any pa&s;&s;ion, and mo&s;t to tho&s;e which ari&s;e from the &s;trength of his ruling pa&s;&s;ion.

<P>IT will not be nece&s;&s;ary for our purpo&s;e, to examine what are the vices congenial to every one of the varieties of temper, which were for|merly pointed out as ari&s;ing from the &s;everal mental powers, either &s;eparately or differently combined together. From the in&s;tances al|ready produced, it is &s;ufficiently plain, that every turn of temper leads naturally to &s;ome vice or another. To the&s;e in&s;tances let us how|ever &s;ubjoin a very few more. Courage may very readily degenerate into fiercene&s;s; re&s;erve into &s;ullenne&s;s; and openne&s;s of temper into &s;uch unwarine&s;s as betrays the &s;ecrets or the intere&s;ts of the deare&s;t friend.

Credulity lays a man open to many means of &s;eduction; and a tendency to doubt may grow up into &s;uch &s;ceptici&s;m as &s;hall enervate every principle of virtue, and annihilate every motive to the practice of it.

firm and &s;teady temper is manly; but if it be ungoverned and undirected, it may produce ob&s;tinacy, rendering a man inflexible in his wor&s;t actions and de&s;igns, irreclaimable in all his vices. The oppo&s;ite temper can &s;carcely, by any pains, be kept from producing &s;ome de|gree of ficklene&s;s and incon&s;tancy, which is it|&s;elf a blemi&s;h; and if no pains be taken to fix it, it will render a per&s;on contemptible and little, incapable of that per&s;evering goodne&s;s, which alone can be either u&s;eful to men or acceptable to God.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame temper, it may be farther ob|&s;erved, will lead a man, with equal readine&s;s, into oppo&s;ite vices in oppo&s;ite &s;ituations. There is an example very common, and very com|monly taken notice of. The &s;ame littlene&s;s of mind renders a man in&s;olent in pro&s;perity, and abject in adver&s;ity. A man of this turn obtains a fortune, and becomes rude to his &s;u|periors, contemptuous to his equals, and op|pre&s;&s;ive to his inferiors; he runs into all ex|travagance, he di&s;&s;ipates his fortune, and he is mean and &s;hamele&s;s in his poverty.

<P>THAT vice, be it what it will, to which our particular temper directly leads us, is an enemy already advanced to the gates of the heart; and if it finds the heart <HI>like a city without walls,</HI> it enters at its plea&s;ure, we can make no re&s;i&s;tance.

<PB N="251" REF="253">
does not merely become en&s;laved to one vice; in con&s;equence of this, he is open to every vice, and certainly &s;hall be led into very many vices. Every ruling &s;in will require from the man who lives in the indulgence of it, the commi&s;&s;ion of many others, for its &s;upport, for its gratification, or for di&s;gui&s;ing and con|cealing it: and if that &s;in has by its &s;uitable|ne&s;s to an ungoverned natural temper, ob|tained dominion over us, it will not be in our power to ab&s;tain from any of the&s;e others, whenever they become nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e pur|po&s;es. This might be illu&s;trated and confirmed by a long detail; but it is not needful to pro|duce many in&s;tances; it lies open to the ob|&s;ervation of every man, in the daily cour&s;e of the world. Few vices at their fir&s;t approach &s;mile &s;o &s;weetly, or &s;o much put on the look of innocence, as the love of plea&s;ure: but let a man, by giving a loo&s;e to his natural tem|per, be once abandoned to the love of plea&s;ure, and the vices are innumerable by which he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be contaminated; it quickly brings on a di&s;reli&s;h of every enjoyment and of every &s;entiment &s;uperior to the gratifications of &s;en&s;uality and the &s;ugge&s;tions of appetite; no office of kindne&s;s, no exertion in doing good mu&s;t be expected from the &s;en&s;uali&s;t; the labour of performing it would break in upon the indolence and de&s;troy the gaiety of the

This very tyrant got po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of David's heart for a little while, and it led him fir&s;t meanly to attempt impo&s;ing a &s;purious offspring on his valiant, faithful, and zealous &s;ervant, and afterwards ba&s;ely to lay a &s;nare for his life, and expo&s;e him to certain de&s;truction in bravely &s;erving him; if it could produce deeds &s;o foul in a &s;hort period of u&s;ur|pation, what a &s;eries of crimes will it not produce when it is quietly &s;ettled on the throne for life? Vanity is, perhaps, in it&s;elf one of the mo&s;t harmle&s;s of the vicious pa&s;|&s;ions, it is reckoned the object rather of ridi|cule, than of indignation; but let it predomi|nate in the temper, and be indulged without re&s;erve, it will lead to vices well de&s;erving of our mo&s;t &s;erious indignation; it will prompt

a man to fal&s;hood and lies in order to rai&s;e ad|miration of his abilities or his exploits; it will hurry him on to an expence of o&s;tentation which his fortune cannot bear, to meanne&s;s and inju&s;tice for &s;upporting it, and to every wile, however unlawful, for hiding the po|verty which it has produced; it will make him betray a tru&s;t, &s;acrifice the rights of others, or venture on the ba&s;e&s;t actions, when by &s;o doing he can di&s;play his importance to the great, or catch the applau&s;es of the multi|tude; it will &s;educe him to deny the mo&s;t momentous truths, to laugh at the mo&s;t &s;a|cred obligations, to propagate the mo&s;t perni|cious maxims, that he may appear &s;uperior to the vulgar. Genero&s;ity is an amiable temper: but the man who has allowed the genero&s;ity of his nature to lead him into profu&s;ion, will &s;oon become guilty of all the vices which &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary for retrieving his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed cir|cum&s;tances, and will find his heart embittered again&s;t mankind, by the ingratitude of tho&s;e on whom he injudiciou&s;ly lavi&s;hed his favours.

<P>BUT it de&s;erves to be particularly remarked, that as &s;oon as the mi&s;government of natural temper has &s;ubjected a man to one predominant or ruling vice, he is no longer proof again&s;t even &s;uch vices as are in them&s;elves mo&s;t oppo|&s;ite to that very temper. To a per&s;on who is under the dominion of any one vice, mere temper is not a &s;ecurity again&s;t any crime. Every one's ob&s;ervation will &s;upply him with in&s;tances of per&s;ons who, being engaged in one vicious cour&s;e, have by it been led into &s;ins mo&s;t contrary to their nature, and at the thought of which they would have &s;huddered, if their darling &s;in had not demanded them, and produced in&s;en&s;ibility to their ba&s;ene&s;s; with in&s;tances of the &s;oft and gentle being brought to act with cruelty, and even to venture upon murder; of the benevolent and kind-hearted labouring to bring ruin upon tho&s;e who hap|pened to &s;tand in the way of &s;ome unlawful project; of the generous, in the pro&s;ecution of &s;ome bad de&s;ign, &s;tooping to the mo&s;t &s;or|did

actions; of the candid and open betrayed into &s;chemes of artifice, di&s;&s;imulation, and fal&s;hood; of the timid ru&s;hing forward into the mo&s;t dangerous crimes. Hence a reflection which is often made, and is &s;o obvious as to occur to the lea&s;t di&s;cerning, of a per&s;on who has become addicted to any vice, that it has changed his very nature.</P>
<P>THUS the man who abandons him&s;elf to that one vice which ari&s;es from the corruption of his natural temper, is from that moment in danger of every &s;in. Every predominant vice requires as great a number of other vices to be &s;ub&s;ervient to it in the cour&s;e of a wicked life, as the mini&s;ters whom any tyrant can &s;tand in need of, to be the in&s;truments of his cruelty, rapacity, and lu&s;ts. In con&s;equence of indulging that vice which &s;uits his particu|lar temper, the &s;inner becomes polluted with many acts of almo&s;t all &s;ins, and depraved by confirmed habits of very many &s;ins. By be|ing <HI>like a city without walls,</HI> de&s;titute of de|fence again&s;t any &s;in, he becomes <HI>like a city broken down,</HI> reduced to ruins, de&s;olated, un|inhabited, and uninhabitable; and, as the prophet foretold of ancient Babylon, <HI>wild bea&s;ts of the de&s;ert lie there, and their hou&s;es</HI> are <HI>full of doleful creatures, and owls dwell there, and &s;atyrs dance there, and the wild bea&s;ts of</HI>

<P>AFTER the detail which has been given of the con&s;equences of our neglecting to govern our natural temper, can it be nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e many words for di&s;&s;uading us from the neg|lect? Can any of you think of pleading your temper as an excu&s;e for any vice? Do you not &s;ee that becau&s;e your temper leans to that par|ticular vice, you ought for that very rea&s;on to guard again&s;t it with the greater anxiety and care? On that &s;ide your danger is mo&s;t im|minent, and therefore to that &s;ide your quicke&s;t and your mo&s;t con&s;tant vigilance &s;hould be di|rected. Can you imagine that God requires you not to employ all the care that is nece&s;&s;ary for governing your natural temper? To ima|gine it, were to &s;uppo&s;e that he gives every man allowance to live in the practice of &s;ome one &s;in; for every peculiarity of temper in|dulged without controul, it has been clearly &s;hewn, terminates naturally and inevitably, in a corre&s;pondent vice. Nay, to imagine it, were to &s;uppo&s;e that God has granted unlimited permi&s;&s;ion to commit all &s;ins in &s;ome particu|lar
<PB N="257" REF="259">
&s;ituations: for there is no &s;in, which the predominant vice &s;pringing from the indul|gence of a man's natural temper, may not at times demand. Such imaginations are ab&s;urd and impious; and therefore it mu&s;t be true, that God requires each of us to <HI>rule his own &s;pirit,</HI> to re&s;train and regulate the prevailing bias of his nature. The work is difficult, very difficult: but &s;ince it is a nece&s;&s;ary and im|portant work, its difficulty ought only to aug|ment our care and diligence in performing it. Its difficulty will be no excu&s;e for our neglect|ing it; it only renders it a very &s;ub&s;tantial part of our probation and moral di&s;cipline. In &s;pite of our greate&s;t care and our mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous application, the natural temper will, I fear, &s;tart forth now and then into vice; the mer|ciful God, who <HI>knoweth our frame, and re|membereth that we are du&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. ciii. 14.</NOTE>, will doubtle&s;s reckon this among the infirmities of our na|ture, to which he extends his paternal pity; but it will be only with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who &s;incerely exert them&s;elves in oppo&s;ing and &s;ub|duing it: tho&s;e who be&s;tow no pains upon it, he will hold to be without excu&s;e, and to them he will impute all the corruption and all the crimes which ari&s;e from the mi&s;govern|ment of their temper. In this as in every
<PB N="258" REF="260">
other ca&s;e, God's mercy is great to the failings of the upright, but he &s;howeth no mercy to any wicked tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. Can you think without horror, of the ba&s;ene&s;s of tho&s;e mul|tiplied vices with which the habitual mi&s;go|vernment of your natural temper mu&s;t in time over&s;pread your &s;ouls? Can you think without terror of the accumulated guilt of all the&s;e vices, and of the puni&s;hment to which they mu&s;t expo&s;e you? Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and actuated by the&s;e emotions, be rou&s;ed to every exertion for removing the faulty propen&s;ity of your nature. It is like a &s;ubtle poi&s;on pervading all the powers of your &s;ouls, mixing it&s;elf with all your &s;entiments and actions, and infecting them; it envenoms the foundation, and viti|ates all the i&s;&s;ues of life. While you neglect to govern your natural temper, all your en|deavours to avoid or to mortify the vices which &s;pring from it, will be but like lopping off a few twigs, which the vigour of the root will enable quickly to grow again, perhaps &s;tronger and more luxuriant than before: it is only by &s;etting your&s;elves at once to govern it, to rec|tify all its perver&s;ities, that you can <HI>lay the axe to the root of the tree,</HI> and effectually kill all the branches. Thus &s;hall we in the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t effectual manner, by the grace of God, render our hearts pure, our conduct blame|le&s;s, con&s;i&s;tent, and uniform, and our&s;elves

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT men's natural tempers are by a multitude of cau&s;es rendered infinitely various; and that every man's governing his own temper is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to prevent his being by it precipitated, not only into the vices which &s;uit it mo&s;t, but al&s;o, by means of them, into almo&s;t every vice, and con&s;equently is his indi&s;pen&s;ible duty, has been already &s;hewn, in two di&s;|cour&s;es. It remains on this &s;ubject, and &s;hall be the bu&s;ine&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;e, to &s;hew, how this duty ought to be performed; to explain, what is implied in the government of the na|tural temper, or in a man's having <HI>rule over his own &s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="263">IT implies not, that a man de&s;troy his pe|culiar temper. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of govern|ment, not to exterminate the &s;ubjects, but to direct, to animate, and to re&s;train them pro|perly. To extirpate one's natural temper, is impo&s;&s;ible. It is a di&s;tingui&s;hing character, impre&s;&s;ed on every &s;oul by the hand of the Almighty, which the power of man can no more era&s;e, than it can e&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ace the di&s;tinctive characters of the &s;everal kinds of plants and animals, and reduce them all to one kind.</P>
<P>IF it were po&s;&s;ible for a man to de&s;troy his peculiar temper, it would not be nece&s;&s;ary, it would be even pernicious. It is for the be&s;t purpo&s;es, that the all-wi&s;e God hath di&s;tri|buted among mankind &s;o great a diver&s;ity of tempers: could we de&s;troy that diver&s;ity, all the&s;e purpo&s;es would be defeated. The beau|tiful variety which at pre&s;ent prevails among the human &s;pecies, would di&s;appear; an in|&s;ipid &s;amene&s;s of character would &s;ucceed. Men would no longer be di&s;po&s;ed to different pur&s;uits and manners of acting, nor fitted for uniting clo&s;ely in &s;ociety: all would act in the &s;ame manner, each would be fit only for &s;oli|tude or for independence; all the delights and all the benefits of &s;ocial connexion and &s;ocial commerce would be at an end.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="264">AMONG all the varieties of temper which men po&s;&s;e&s;s, there is not one incon&s;i&s;tent with virtue, there is not one which duty requires us to endeavour to extirpate. We are apt to con|&s;ider &s;ome turns of natural temper as in them|&s;elves virtuous or vicious. The rea&s;on is, that the affections from who&s;e predominance &s;ome tempers re&s;ult, are naturally friendly to virtue, and lead to it when they are cheri&s;hed; and tho&s;e in the predominance of which other tempers con&s;i&s;t, tend mo&s;t directly to vice, and lead to it whenever they are indulged. The former tempers, &s;uch for in&s;tance as hold of the benevolent affections, are in them&s;elves de&s;irable and amiable; the latter, &s;uch for example as proceed from anger, or from any of the &s;elfi&s;h principles, are di&s;agreeable, ren|der the practice of &s;ome virtues difficult, and put men in great danger of becoming vicious. Our pronene&s;s to run into the mi&s;take is the greater, becau&s;e the names given to tempers of the one kind often imply their improve|ment into virtue, and the names given to tho&s;e of the other kind expre&s;s that turpitude which belongs to them only when they have degenerated into vice. But as the former, con&s;idered only as natural bia&s;&s;es, have no real virtue, &s;o the latter, con&s;idered in the &s;ame light, are not really vicious. It is an unhap|pine&s;s to be marked with them, but it is not
<PB N="264" REF="265">
&s;inful in it&s;elf. They are very liable to abu&s;e; and the abu&s;e of them is &s;inful: but the be&s;t natural temper may likewi&s;e be abu&s;ed; and the abu&s;e of it too is &s;inful.</P>
<P>BUT though it be neither po&s;&s;ible nor ne|ce&s;&s;ary to <HI>extirpate</HI> the natural temper, it is both po&s;&s;ible and nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>govern</HI> it. We every day meet with per&s;ons who, from good breed|ing, or from prudence, can di&s;gui&s;e their tem|per and keep it from &s;hewing it&s;elf, not on one occa&s;ion, but on many occa&s;ions and through a long cour&s;e of time; could not, then, better principles enable them to correct it? We ac|tually &s;ee &s;ome per&s;ons who have corrected very bad natural tempers, to a great degree: their clo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t intimate friends perceive little &s;tarts of them on particular emergences; but the general tenor of their behaviour retains no ve&s;tige of their con&s;titutional fault of tem|per; mo&s;t of their acquaintance can &s;carcely believe that ever they were &s;ubject to it. A phy&s;iognomi&s;t pretended to di&s;cover by his art, that the great Athenian philo&s;opher Socrates was addicted to vices &s;o oppo&s;ite to his whole conduct and character, that all who knew him were di&s;po&s;ed to ridicule the preten&s;ions of the phy&s;iognomi&s;t as ab&s;urd: but, to their a&s;toni&s;hment, Socrates declared, that he was, by his con&s;titutional bia&s;s, prone to all the vices
<PB N="265" REF="266">
which had been imputed to him, and that it was only by philo&s;ophy that he had got the better of them. Would it not be &s;hameful, if many Chri&s;tians could not make a &s;imilar declaration? By the power of Chri&s;tian prin|ciples, the government of the natural temper may certainly be carried to a great height of perfection. Let us con&s;ider what it implies, and carefully &s;et our&s;elves to practi&s;e it. The government of our peculiar temper may be com|prehended in three particulars,&mdash;that we re&s;train it from breaking out into &s;in,&mdash;that we render it &s;ub&s;ervient to the practice of virtue,&mdash;and that we incorporate it with all our virtues.</P>
<P>1. THE fir&s;t object of a man's care, in <HI>ruling his own &s;pirit,</HI> is to re&s;train his natural bias, &s;o that it may not become vicious, or lead him into &s;in. The lea&s;t that can be incumbent on us, is to keep it within &s;uch bounds that it may continue innocent: but even this will be very difficult. The natural temper may be compared to a con&s;titutional pronene&s;s to any bodily di&s;temper, which it is po&s;&s;ible to pre|vent from actually breaking out into that di&s;|temper, or at lea&s;t from breaking out into other than &s;hort and moderate fits of it, con|&s;i&s;tent with an habitual &s;tate of health: but this can be obtained only by con&s;tant attention to the con&s;titution, by unintermitted care to
<PB N="266" REF="267">
ob&s;erve a regimen fit to counteract it; if it be in the lea&s;t degree neglected the di&s;temper will break out with violence, and become mortal. In like manner, to prevent our natural temper from bringing us under the dominion of tho&s;e fins which are &s;uitable to it, will require the mo&s;t inten&s;e and unwearied diligence in oppo&s;ing every irregular tendency, and re&s;training every blameable exertion of that temper, in avoiding every action which can confirm it, and every object and opinion which can increa&s;e its faulty bias, and in pur&s;uing &s;uch a conduct, cheri&s;hing &s;uch opinions, and dwelling upon &s;uch ob|jects, as are fit to wear off that bias. Dili|gence in all this, is nece&s;&s;ary for our avoiding every vice, but it is peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary for our avoiding that ruling vice to which our con&s;titution makes us to lean mo&s;t &s;trongly.</P>
<P>EVERY pa&s;&s;ion and affection is weak and pli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ble in the moment of its birth. Had we al|ways recollection enough to ob&s;erve, and re&s;o|lution enough to check its fir&s;t tendency to ir|regularity, our victory over it would be ea&s;y. But if we let &s;lip this favourable moment, it will &s;oon be able to carry us wherever it plea&s;es. <HI>When thou fitte&s;t to eat,</HI> &s;ays Solomon, <HI>put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxii. 1, 2.</NOTE>.

Good men fall into other &s;ins, only before a violent temptation, or by being very much off their guard: but the be&s;t men, by the lea&s;t failure in circum&s;pection, or on a very weak temptation, &s;ometimes fall into particular acts of tho&s;e &s;ins which &s;uit their natural temper; the temptation to them is ever pre&s;ent, it lurks within, it is in the heart it&s;elf. We &s;hould not for this rea&s;on give indulgence to &s;uch &s;ins, or &s;uffer our&s;elves to think favourably of them: whenever we fall into them, we &s;hould repent deeply: that we may not have occa&s;ion often to repent of them, we &s;hould direct our &s;tricte&s;t attention to them, and employ our mo&s;t &s;trenuous endeavours again&s;t them, and thus, if human infirmity permits not our avoid|ing them wholly, render our commi&s;&s;ion of them le&s;s frequent every day. A propen&s;ity to them is the weak part of the fortre&s;s; it needs a double guard. To pre&s;erve us from the&s;e vices, is one of the chief purpo&s;es for which the grace of God is given; a victory over them, is one of the greate&s;t triumphs of divine grace in the heart of man: grace to conquer them &s;hould be one of the greate&s;t &s;ub|jects of our prayers; and we &s;hould improve the grace of God to this purpo&s;e, with the ut|mo&s;t diligence. The generality neglect to go|vern their natural temper, even &s;o far as to re&s;train it from becoming vicious, or productive
<PB N="274" REF="275">
of vicious actions: but the government of the temper, the ruling of a man's <HI>own &s;pirit,</HI> im|plies much more than this.</P>
<P>2. IT implies, that every man render his temper &s;ub&s;ervient to the practice of virtue and holine&s;s. As every natural temper, even the mo&s;t amiable, may degenerate into vice, &s;o on the contrary, every temper, even that which becomes mo&s;t di&s;agreeable by the &s;malle&s;t cor|ruption of it, may be made to contribute to the virtue of the heart. To make our natural temper to contribute to this, is an important part of our duty in governing it: it is the bu|&s;ine&s;s of government, not only to re&s;train the &s;ubjects from crimes, but al&s;o to encourage them in right practice, and to direct and regulate their &s;everal occupations.</P>
<P>EVERY natural temper properly managed and improved, may give us an advantage, ei|ther for the practice of &s;ome particular vir|tue, or for the general &s;ecurity of our virtue.&mdash;Some turns of temper are naturally and &s;trongly allied to virtue. It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, becau&s;e it is &s;o plain, that all the tempers which are founded in a predominance of the kind affections, are directly favourable to the love of mankind, to all the important virtues of benevolence and charity, and render the practice of every &s;ocial duty ea&s;y and plea|&s;ant;
<PB N="275" REF="276">
or that they introduce a habit of &s;oul congruous to the love of God, as well as to that inward &s;erenity which characterizes every grace, and renders it doubly amiable.</P>
<P>OTHER turns of temper are, as it were, neutral between virtue and vice: in perceiving how the&s;e may be rendered &s;erviceable to vir|tue, there is little difficulty. The keen and eager temper, in which de&s;ire is the chief in|gredient, when directed to holine&s;s as its ob|ject, will render a man &s;pirited in the practice of it, and &s;u&s;ceptible of a &s;trong impul&s;e from its joys and rewards. The contrary temper, in which aver&s;ion prevails, tends to cheri&s;h a deep abhorrence of &s;in, which is one of the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t permanent &s;ecurities again&s;t the indulgence of it. Both the&s;e tempers may become equally conducive to holine&s;s, by prompting us, the one to avoid evil, the other to do good. The temper of confidence which hope produces, will encourage the heart to a&s;pire after the mo&s;t excellent attainments, and to attempt the mo&s;t arduous improvements in virtue. It &s;eems to have been eminently the temper of the apo&s;tle Paul; in the &s;chool of Gamaliel, it led him to <HI>profit in the Jews religion above many</HI> his <HI>equals in</HI> his <HI>own na|tion</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. i. 14.</NOTE>; in the Chri&s;tian church, it made him

The oppo&s;ite temper, like|wi&s;e, of caution and timidity has &s;o many pe|culiar advantages, is &s;o friendly to circum|&s;pection and watchfulne&s;s, and con&s;equently to that holine&s;s which, without the&s;e, cannot be &s;teadily and blamele&s;sly practi&s;ed in this &s;tate of trial and difficulty, that the wi&s;e man &s;ays, <HI>Happy is the man that feareth alway</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxviii. 14.</NOTE>. When a chearful heart is united to a virtuous cha|racter, it favours the improvement of it, it is its ornament, it gives a grace to all its exer|tions, it renders it amiable and attractive. Neither is the contrary temper without its own advantages; when it is duly regulated, it pro|duces a &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in religion, which is ve|nerable and commanding, and proves a pre|&s;ervative again&s;t many &s;ins. A high tone of the pa&s;&s;ions, a &s;en&s;ibility, ardour, or activity of &s;pirit, prepares the &s;oul for entering into the raptures of devotion, for feeling the fer|vours of godly zeal, for &s;hewing eminent ala|crity in every duty. This temper led John
<PB N="277" REF="278">
to &s;in, on one occa&s;ion, by wi&s;hing for fire from heaven to con&s;ume the Samaritans <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke ix. 54.</NOTE>, and on another occa&s;ion, by intriguing for one of the chief places in the kingdom of Chri&s;t <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xx. 21.

A temper oppo&s;ite to this, may be improved into a &s;ettled compo&s;ure and calm equability in the love and practice of holine&s;s. A re&s;olute &s;pirit will render it the ea&s;ier to be &s;teadfa&s;t in in our adherence to goodne&s;s. A pliable and variable temper is, to a certain degree, requi&s;ite for our being ready to correct what we have done ami&s;s. But it is unnece&s;&s;ary to enter far|ther into particulars on this head.</P>
<P>IT is more needful to ob&s;erve, becau&s;e it is not &s;o obvious, that even tho&s;e turns of temper which are mo&s;t nearly allied to vice, and which are with the greate&s;t difficulty kept from running into it, may notwith&s;tanding be rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to virtue. Pride, for in|&s;tance, may be improved into true dignity of character, into a noble and habitual di&s;dain of every thought and action that is mean or
<PB N="278" REF="279">
ba&s;e. An ambitious temper needs only to be fixed upon its propere&s;t objects, in order to animate us in the indefatigable pur&s;uit of that genuine honour which re&s;ults from the appro|bation of God and from the glories of heaven, and which will be be&s;towed only on the righteous, and in proportion to their righteou&s;|ne&s;s. A temper which, by being neglected, would become blameably &s;elfi&s;h and contracted, will, by being governed, become eminently conducive to prudence, and an incitement to diligence in that cour&s;e of holine&s;s which is our real wi&s;dom and our be&s;t intere&s;t. Even that temper in which the malevolent affec|tions tend to preponderate, the &s;our, the mo|ro&s;e, the ira&s;cible, may be rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to our virtue and improvement: if it be curbed &s;o &s;trongly as not to lead us to hurt others, or to wi&s;h for their hurt, it will exert it&s;elf in a keen indignation again&s;t vice, in a rigorous purity of heart, in a blamele&s;s &s;everity of manners; and it will make us inacce&s;&s;ible to many temptations which have great power over &s;oft, and gentle, and &s;ocial minds.</P>
<P>THUS every temper may be rendered pro|ductive of &s;ome advantages for the practice of virtue; and it is our duty to con&s;ider what are the advantages which our particular temper gives us, and to improve them with care.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="280">3. WE ought not only to render our pecu|liar temper &s;ub&s;ervient to virtue, but al&s;o to incorporate it with all our virtues.</P>
<P>WHETHER a man's character be good or bad, his natural temper will run through it, if it be not violently hindered, and will tinge it with a corre&s;pondent complexion. Both the particular vices to which different &s;inners addict them&s;elves, and the particular manners in which they practi&s;e the &s;ame vices, are in a great mea&s;ure determined by their different tempers. The grace of God does not extin|gui&s;h the diver&s;ity of tempers; it only purifies and rectifies each of them. There is a great variety in the make of human bodies, even &s;uch as have nothing faulty or di&s;proportioned; one is formed for &s;trength, another for agility; the beauty of one con&s;i&s;ts in dignity, that of another in elegance: there are &s;till greater varieties in men's inward characters, even when all of them are virtuous. In di&s;po&s;itions and manners no-wi&s;e blameable, there may be great di&s;&s;imilitude. Characters equally good are yet never the very &s;ame. No virtue is wholly wanting in any good character: but one virtue or another predominates according to the original propen&s;ity of the &s;oul, and directs and &s;hapes the exertion of all the re&s;t; and according to the &s;ame propen&s;ity, any one virtue is exer|ci&s;ed and practi&s;ed in a different manner and
<PB N="280" REF="281">
&s;tile by different men. Survey the good cha|racters with which you are acquainted; you will find them di&s;tingui&s;hed in both the&s;e re|&s;pects; no two of them are perfectly alike. All the good men who&s;e lives the &s;cripture has recorded, di&s;play different forms of holine&s;s derived from their di&s;&s;imilar tempers. Job is characterized by patience; Mo&s;es by meekne&s;s; David is high-&s;pirited, his devotion is fervent, his virtues are all heroic; Solomon has a &s;ofter &s;oul, turned for exerci&s;ing virtue in the mild arts of peace; John and Paul are both warm, fervent, and affectionate, but the warmth of the former is &s;weet and gentle, that of the latter bold and enterprizing. To the influ|ence of the natural temper informing and fa&s;hioning the whole character and conduct, are owing all the varieties of characters truly virtuous: without that influence they could differ only in the <HI>degree</HI> of their goodne&s;s; in all other re&s;pects they would be preci&s;ely &s;imilar.</P>
<P>As every man thus derives from nature a di&s;tinct per&s;onal character, he ought to adhere to it, and to pre&s;erve its peculiar decorum. He can pre&s;erve it only by maintaining his own natural temper &s;o far as it is innocent, and acting always in conformity to it. We ought to comply with and follow our own
<PB N="281" REF="282">
particular and proper nature in the ca&s;t of our whole behaviour; to violate it, will always be of bad con&s;equence. Equability, con&s;i&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nce, and uniformity in the whole tenor of our lives is of very great importance; but it can|not be obtained, if we endeavour to put on the nature of another man, and to throw off our own. In whatever in&s;tances we attempt it, our behaviour cannot be natural or grace|ful; that will always become every man mo&s;t, which is mo&s;t his own. Every depar|ture from a man's own per&s;onal character is an affectation which will be either ridiculous or di&s;gu&s;ting. It is like the painting of the face, it di&s;gui&s;es the genuine complexion of the &s;oul. It is like altering the natural ca&s;t of the body by running into di&s;torted attitudes and motions. It is as if, in ancient games, the brawny wre&s;tler had engaged only in the cour&s;e, and the man who was fitted for the race had endeavoured to &s;ignalize him&s;elf by feats of &s;trength. A man naturally &s;edate and grave, attempting gaiety and frolic, be|comes an aukward bu&s;&s;oon; and a man natu|rally chearful, putting on gravity and &s;eve|verity, becomes no le&s;s aukwardly moro&s;e; each of them con&s;idered at one time, forms a perfect contra&s;t to him&s;elf as he appears at another time. The man of a mild, gentle, timorous, flexible &s;pirit, by choo&s;ing a walk

in life which &s;uits him, will be truly amia|ble; but &s;hould he &s;et up for a bold reformer, or intrude into a bu&s;tling &s;phere, or ru&s;h for|ward into dangerous enterpri&s;es, he would quickly lo&s;e him&s;elf, and betray his weakne&s;s. In a word, as every violation of a man's pecu|liar temper is, in its own way, di&s;agreeable, ungraceful, and pernicious, it is an important part of the government of the temper, to per|form all our duties, and to cultivate and ex|erci&s;e all our virtues in congruity to it, and thus to maintain the decency of our per&s;onal and di&s;tinctive character.</P>
<P>To conclude this &s;ubject; if we would <HI>rule</HI> our <HI>own &s;pirit,</HI> if we would govern our natural temper, let us re&s;train it from degenerating into vice, or leading us into &s;in: let us take every advantage which it can give us for the improvement of our hearts, and the practice of our duty: by pre&s;erving it and adhering to it &s;o far as it is not vicious, let us render our whole character natural and uniform, and all our conduct graceful and con&s;i&s;tent. The means of governing our peculiar temper are the &s;ame with the means of performing every other duty, re&s;olution, congruous exerci&s;es, watchfulne&s;s, and prayer. But all the&s;e means we mu&s;t in this ca&s;e employ with peculiar care and diligence, becau&s;e it is a matter of peculiar difficulty to controul and regulate our predo|minant

di&s;po&s;ition. Its importance is, how|ever, in proportion to its difficulty. If we can effectually accompli&s;h this, it will render it the ea&s;ier to &s;ubdue all our other irregular pa&s;&s;ions. They act in &s;ubordination to it, and derive a great part of their &s;trength from it; and to &s;ubdue it, is like cutting off the gene|ral, who was the &s;pirit of the battle, and on who&s;e fall the army breaks and takes to flight. By cheri&s;hing our natural temper when re|fined from all perver&s;ity, we &s;hall facilitate the practice of virtue, we &s;hall render our vir|tues truly our own, con&s;i&s;tent, becoming, and graceful; we &s;hall obtain that inward tran|quillity, &s;atisfaction, and &s;elf-enjoyment which attends a natural &s;tate and behaviour; and when we are removed from this world, we &s;hall find in our <HI>Father's hou&s;e man&s;ions</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 2.</NOTE> pe|culiarly adapted to our character, and &s;hall be fit to fill our proper place in the heavenly &s;o|ciety, to the beauty, perfection, harmony, and happine&s;s of which a variety of characters, &s;tations, and employments doubtle&s;s will con|tribute.</P>

I propo&s;e to illu&s;trate this temper, by pointing out the &s;everal particulars which are implied in it.</P>
<P>1. THE p&s;almi&s;t's temper implies a lively &s;en&s;e of the &s;upreme importance of holine&s;s. A

The&s;e views of holine&s;s impre&s;&s;ed him with &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of its importance, as naturally dictated this earne&s;t wi&s;h, <HI>that</HI> his <HI>ways were directed to keep</HI> God's <HI>&s;tatutes.</HI> And when he had formed this wi&s;h, he hugged it in his very heart; he exulted in the pro&s;pect of the inward peace, &s;elf-complacence, and joy, which the accompli&s;hment of it would give him; and by this pro&s;pect he cheri&s;hed his wi&s;h and in|crea&s;ed its ardour; <HI>then &s;hall I not be a&s;hamed, when I have re&s;pect unto all thy commandments: I will prai&s;e thee with uprightne&s;s of heart, when I &s;hall have learned thy righteous judgments</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 6, 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN whatever light we con&s;ider holine&s;s, we may well be &s;en&s;ible of its importance. When we con&s;ider it merely in relation to the &s;enti|ments of our own hearts, it is of &s;uch un|&s;peakable
<PB N="288" REF="288">
con&s;equence, that, if we be de&s;titute of it, if we be con&s;cious of our having lived in the violation of its laws, we cannot approve our&s;elves, but mu&s;t be a&s;hamed and de&s;pi&s;e our&s;elves, in every moment of &s;erious reflec|tion. Holine&s;s is of indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation, for it is the law of the God who made us, the Sovereign of heaven and earth. It is the health of the &s;oul, the balm of adver&s;ity, the orna|ment of pro&s;perity, the greate&s;t good of man, the happine&s;s both of the pre&s;ent life and of the future. The wi&s;e man e&s;timates matters ju&s;tly when he declares that to <HI>fear God, and keep his commandments, is the whole</HI> duty <HI>of man</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccl. xii. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT many of us &s;eem to form a very dif|ferent judgment. If we ever think of the im|portance of keeping God's law, we think of it very &s;eldom and very &s;lightly: the thought &s;inks not &s;o deep as to touch the heart; it cer|tainly continues not &s;o long nor recurs &s;o often as to make a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on the heart. Far from regarding holine&s;s as our chief, and, in compari&s;on, our only concern, we &s;eem to think it le&s;s our concern than any thing be|&s;ides. A moment of guilty plea&s;ure, a few pence, the gratification of any appetite or pa&s;|&s;ion, &s;eems to be, in our opinion, of greater

No wond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r then that we are &s;o indifferent, whether we do right or wrong, whether we improve or corrupt our&s;elves. Without a deep and permanent &s;en&s;e of the importance of virtue, as our dig|nity, our duty, and our intere&s;t, we cannot be &s;olicitous to cultivate and practi&s;e it.</P>
<P>2. THE temper which the p&s;almi&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;es in the text, implies a &s;ettled love of goodne&s;s and hatred of iniquity. This is the natural con&s;equence of the former part of this temper. A ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the importance of ho|line&s;s cannot fail to attach our hearts to it; and it will not &s;uffer us to be cold or lukewarm in our attachment. <HI>Thy word,</HI> &s;ays our p&s;al|mi&s;t, <HI>is very pure, therefore thy &s;ervant loveth it. I hate vain thoughts, but thy law do I love. My &s;oul hath kept thy te&s;timonies, and I love them exceedingly</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 140. 113. 163. 167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE wor&s;t of men cannot help approving virtue and di&s;approving vice: but the approba|tion and di&s;approbation of the wicked are only cool perceptions of the under&s;tanding. In the good man, the&s;e perceptions are improved into warm &s;entiments of the heart, are made to
<PB N="290" REF="290">
grow up into lively affections of love and ha|tred. A &s;trong conception of the beauty of holine&s;s, of the excellent nature and the happy con&s;equences of virtue enamours his &s;oul, and makes him to feel all that David felt when he &s;aid, <HI>O how love I thy law! it is my me|ditation all the day. How &s;weet are thy words unto my ta&s;te! yea, &s;weeter than honey to my mouth. Through thy precepts I get under&s;tand|ing: therefore I hate every fal&s;e way. There|fore I love thy commandments above gold, yea, above fine gold. Therefore I e&s;teem all thy pre|cepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every fal&s;e way</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 97. 103, 104. 127, 128.</NOTE>. Hatred of &s;in is in&s;eparable from the love of holine&s;s; it is its counterpart, it is a different exertion of the very &s;ame affection. The more warmly we are affected by the excellence of virtue, the &s;tronger &s;en&s;e we mu&s;t have of the ba&s;ene&s;s of vice, the greater mu&s;t be our abhorrence of it, the keener our indignation again&s;t it. A &s;trong affection to any object alway implies aver&s;ion to its contrary. If virtue be the darling of the heart, vice mu&s;t be its dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>THESE principles rooted and cheri&s;hed in the &s;oul, will nece&s;&s;arily promote virtuous &s;o|licitude. Actuated by them, we cannot but
<PB N="291" REF="291">
regret deeply every failure in our duty, every &s;tain and depravity of our temper; we mu&s;t long for deliverance from every remain of the body of &s;in; we mu&s;t be intent upon holine&s;s, and fired with a noble ardour in the practice of it.</P>
<P>3. THIS leads us on to ob&s;erve, that the temper expre&s;&s;ed in the text, includes a vigo|rous, con&s;tant, and prevailing de&s;ire to keep God's &s;tatutes. This is indeed the leading feature in that temper, it is the mo&s;t obvious language of David's wi&s;h. It will naturally &s;pring from a &s;en&s;e of the importance of holi|ne&s;s, and from love to it on account of its im|portance: and it is only when it &s;prings from the&s;e that it can have either vigour or &s;tability. When a wi&s;h that we were holy, &s;prings up &s;uddenly, as is too often the ca&s;e, only from an occa&s;ional fit of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, from accidental experience of &s;ome of the inconveniences of our vices, from the pre&s;ent depre&s;&s;ion of adver&s;ity, or from a momentary dread of the wrath of God, as from a &s;eed dropt by chance in an improper or unprepared &s;oil; no wonder that it is weak and puny, and quickly withers; for it has no &s;ound and healthy root. It mu&s;t grow out of a warm love to goodne&s;s, el&s;e it cannot thrive. That it may thrive, and yield its proper fruits, it mu&s;t be both &s;trong and con&s;tant.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="292">RARE and tran&s;ient wi&s;hes for holine&s;s, however ardent, will be of &s;mall avail. There are few of us, perhaps, who do not &s;ometimes wi&s;h, and wi&s;h earne&s;tly too, that we were better than we are. It is only the &s;inner who is abandoned in his way, that never forms this wi&s;h. It now and then &s;tarts up in the thoughtle&s;s &s;ons of plea&s;ure, in the mid&s;t of their di&s;&s;ipation; though it &s;tays not long enough to pre&s;erve them from going again into <HI>the hou&s;e of a &s;trange woman</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. vii. 5. 8.</NOTE>, or from <HI>&s;eeking for mixt wine</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxii. 30.</NOTE>, on the next oc|ca&s;ion. It &s;ometimes &s;teals into the heart of the bu&s;y worldling, though the cares of life bani&s;h it before it can excite him to <HI>labour</HI> &s;trenuou&s;ly <HI>for the meat which endureth unto everla&s;ting life</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John vi. 27.</NOTE>. Sinners of every cla&s;s can|not help &s;ometimes wi&s;hing, their own &s;ouls know it, &s;or deliverance from the power of &s;in. Nay, all who have not proceeded far and per&s;i&s;ted long in &s;in, are at times w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ung with angui&s;h, and in the bitterne&s;s of their &s;ouls groan heavily for reformation. But all their wi&s;hes and their groans are u&s;ele&s;s, becau&s;e they are not permanent and habitual.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, our de&s;ires of virtue and improvement will not be &s;ufficient, though
<PB N="293" REF="293">
they be con&s;tant, if they are not likewi&s;e &s;trong. A man may feel pretty con&s;tantly a faint de&s;ire of doing good; but becau&s;e it is faint, it is therefore ineffectual. We &s;ome|times feel &s;uch a de&s;ire, even while we are committing &s;in. At the very time when op|portunity invites, when temptation &s;olicits, when appetite or pa&s;&s;ion prompts to an act of &s;in, we yet do not run into it with full com|placence; there are de&s;ires and wi&s;hes on the other &s;ide; they &s;truggle again&s;t the commi&s;&s;ion of the &s;in: but they are vanqui&s;hed by the &s;uperior &s;trength of &s;in&s;ul inclination: yet they do not yield in &s;ilence; they complain, as it were, of the violence which they &s;uffer; they make us to feel great reluctance again&s;t the &s;in, even while they yield. When the act of &s;in is over, the virtuous de&s;ires revive: we are pierced with grief; we wi&s;h that we had not done it; we wi&s;h and pray that we may be more re&s;olute hereafter. But corrupt inclination &s;oon begins again to ri&s;e; it &s;trug|gles again&s;t the nobler wi&s;h for virtue: the&s;e oppo&s;ite de&s;ires po&s;&s;e&s;s the heart by turns; they &s;ometimes even occupy it together, and di&s;tract it. But on a new trial, the vicious de&s;ire puts forth all its &s;trength: the virtuous wi&s;h is over|whelmed; in every trial it fails, for it has not vigour enough to actuate us uniformly, in oppo&s;ition to vicious principles.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="294">DAVID'S concern to practi&s;e and improve in holine&s;s, was at once vigorous, and &s;teady. He explicitly declares both its vehemence and its con&s;tancy; <HI>Behold, I have longed after thy precepts. My &s;oul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times. I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 40. 20. 131.</NOTE>.

<P>4. THE temper of &s;olicitude to keep God's &s;tatutes, which David expre&s;&s;es in the text, implies a firm re&s;olution to keep them. That he was re&s;olved, he t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lls us explicitly when he &s;ays almo&s;t immediately after, <HI>I will keep thy &s;tatutes</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 8.</NOTE>. <HI>I have cho&s;en the way of truth. I</HI>
<PB N="295" REF="295">
<HI>will keep thy precepts with my whole heart</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 30. 69.</NOTE>. Throughout the p&s;alm, he repeatedly declares his re&s;olution, in a great variety of terms. The de&s;ire of being virtuous, naturally pro|duces a re&s;olution to practi&s;e virtue; and by this re&s;olution the de&s;ire is, in its turn, con|firmed.</P>
<P>WE do not &s;incerely de&s;ire a thing, at mo&s;t our de&s;ire of it is very weak, if we at the &s;ame time re&s;olve not to do any thing for ob|taining it. A &s;trong de&s;ire of what in any mea&s;ure depends upon our own endeavours, quickly converts it&s;elf into a re&s;olution to pur|&s;ue it: the de&s;ire is the re&s;olution in its be|ginning; the re&s;olution is the de&s;ire ri&s;en to maturity. When even tran&s;ient wi&s;hes that they were better men, are accidentally excited in the wicked, they always produce, at lea&s;t for a moment, &s;ome de&s;ign of becoming better men. The de&s;ign proves abortive, becau&s;e the wi&s;hes were only tran&s;ient. But were we earne&s;tly and habitually de&s;irous of becoming holy, we would be likewi&s;e &s;incerely and con|&s;tantly determined to practi&s;e holine&s;s. With|out a re&s;olution to do all we can to keep God's &s;tatutes, an ardent de&s;ire to keep them would be an ab&s;olute ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="296">As &s;oon as the re&s;olution is formed, it &s;up|ports and &s;trengthens the de&s;ire. It pre&s;ents the object of the de&s;ire in a new form fit to draw out that de&s;ire with redoubled force; it &s;ets it before us as what we have re&s;olved that we will by any means obtain. <HI>I have &s;aid that I would keep thy words. I have &s;worn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righte|ous judgments</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 57, 106.</NOTE>. The p&s;almi&s;t's prayer in the text, expre&s;&s;es a &s;oul already re&s;olved to practi&s;e virtue, and in con&s;equence of this con|cerned and &s;olicitous to execute the re&s;olution. His re&s;olution was hearty and permanent; and therefore his &s;olicitude was vehement and la&s;t|ing. But too often our re&s;olutions are neither vigorous nor habitual; and our &s;olicitude mu&s;t partake in their infirmity and languor. When a favourable opportunity of committing &s;ome darling &s;in occurs, when a &s;trong temptation to it pre&s;ents it&s;elf, we di&s;cover that we have never made a determined choice of the ways of virtue, that we have been but half re&s;olved to walk in them, that re&s;olution has never taken fa&s;t hold of us. For if our re&s;olution be at all remembered in the hour of difficulty, we find it feeble and impotent; it &s;uffers it|&s;elf to be explained away; we per&s;uade our|&s;elves that it was not nece&s;&s;ary to have formed
<PB N="297" REF="297">
it with &s;o great rigour and &s;everity, and that in this in&s;tance we may venture to counteract it. Enervated by the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions of corrupt pa&s;&s;ion, our good re&s;olutions yield; they vani&s;h; and with them vani&s;hes every de&s;ire to do our duty. This de&s;ire is again awakened; our re&s;olutions are renewed; and renewed &s;till again: but &s;till again they fail, and are for|gotten in the day of trial. Such fluctuation makes it plain that our re&s;olution was not firm. It &s;prang not from a &s;table love of goodne&s;s, nor from a predominant de&s;ire to practi&s;e it: and for that rea&s;on it begets no &s;olicitude to carry it into execution. A hearty re&s;olution would be an unalterable choice of God's <HI>te&s;ti|monies</HI> as our employment and our <HI>heritage for ever</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 111.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>5. THE p&s;almi&s;t's temper which we are de&s;cribing, implies a prevailing bias of the whole &s;oul towards virtuous practice. He de|clares explicitly that this was included in his temper; <HI>I have inclined mine heart to perform thy &s;tatutes alway, even unto the end</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 112.</NOTE>. It is not enough that the <HI>will</HI> be fixt in a determi|nation to practi&s;e holine&s;s; the whole <HI>heart</HI> likewi&s;e, all the affections and &s;prings of action, mu&s;t acquire a continual bent and tendency
<PB N="298" REF="298">
towards the practice of it. Till they have ac|quired this bent, our de&s;ire of practi&s;ing holi|ne&s;s cannot &s;ettle into an uninterrupted &s;oli|citude, but mu&s;t often fail of producing its effect. The inclination of the heart to virtue ari&s;es partly from the reduction of vicious pa&s;|&s;ions, and partly from the vigour of good af|fections.</P>
<P>WHILE vicious pa&s;&s;ions retain &s;o great a &s;trength as to render us often violently prone to &s;in, they will often likewi&s;e make us to look upon our duty with aver&s;ion or regret; they will extingui&s;h for a time the <HI>de&s;ire</HI> of performing it, even though we be determined to perform it; and in the place of that de&s;ire, they will in&s;pire wi&s;hes that we could in this in&s;tance di&s;pen&s;e with obedience to the law of God. Few of us, I fear, have made &s;o great a progre&s;s in virtue, as not &s;ometimes to feel corrupt inclination &s;truggling in this manner again&s;t our be&s;t principles and re&s;olutions. We are, perhaps, determined not to indulge it: but it is &s;o &s;trong that it almo&s;t overcomes us; it is by a &s;ort of force that principle and re&s;o|lution re&s;train us, unwilling and reluctant, from proceeding to the full indulgence of it. It is well if they re&s;train us by any means. God knows that in many ca&s;es they cannot. But their needing to re&s;train us by force, by
<PB N="299" REF="299">
&s;o violent an exertion of their power, is a proof of the imperfection of our holine&s;s. Our heart is not yet enough formed to virtue, el&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">inful pa&s;&s;ion could not re&s;i&s;t &s;o &s;toutly.

But in the per&s;on who is re&s;olved and &s;olicitous to ad|here to virtue, and habitually actuated by this re&s;olution and &s;olicitude, irregular inclinations will be &s;o often ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and &s;o much accu&s;|tomed to &s;ubmit, that whenever the virtuous principle begins to exert it&s;elf, they will, after a few languid efforts, yield without great re|luctance; in like manner as the mo&s;t m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ttle|&s;ome hor&s;e, by being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nured to the bit, readily obeys the gentle&s;t motion of the &s;kilful ri|der.</P>

<P>THE weakne&s;s and the corruption of our nature render the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for our practi&s;ing holine&s;s. A &s;en&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity is &s;ufficient to produce ardent de|&s;ires of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and earne&s;t wi&s;hes for it, in every per&s;on who regards and is attached to holine&s;s as his main concern. Had we in|deed no hope of obtaining it, our wi&s;hes mu&s;t be weak and tran&s;ient: de&s;ire vani&s;hes when we know it to be impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould be fulfilled; it &s;oon becomes languid when its accompli&s;hment appears to be totally uncertain.

In every per&s;on who is not wholly de&s;titute of holine&s;s, &s;ome degree of this &s;olicitude mu&s;t take place.

<P>IN every &s;ituation, that man's concern, who glows with virtuous ardour, will be, not what is agreeable to his humour and inclina|tion, and what will procure him plea&s;ure or advantage, but &s;olely what is right and good.

<Q>And they were both righteous before God, walk|ing in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blamele&s;s.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the&s;e words, which contain the character given by the evangeli&s;t, of the parents of John the Bapti&s;t, the moral precepts of the law are by many thoughts to be meant by <HI>or|dinances,</HI> and the po&s;itive and ritual precepts, by <HI>commandmets:</HI> and in re&s;pect of both, Za|charias and Elizabeth are pronounced <HI>righteous before God,</HI> and <HI>blamele&s;s</HI> in the &s;ight of men. In this light, the words intimate. That a re|gard to ritual duties really in&s;tituted by God, as well as to moral virtue, is nece&s;&s;ary to a worthy and blamele&s;s character. But though the expre&s;&s;ions &s;hould not be con&s;idered as in|tended

to mark this di&s;tinction, it being cer|tain that they are often u&s;ed promi&s;cuou&s;ly in &s;cripture, yet the text will naturally enough &s;ugge&s;t the &s;ame intimation; for none who attends to the nature of the Mo&s;aical di&s;pen|&s;ation, abounding with ceremonies appointed by the immediate authority of God, can ima|gine that a Jew and a Jewi&s;h prie&s;t would have been re&s;pected as bearing a blamele&s;s cha|racter, without the punctual ob&s;ervance of all the ritual duties of his religion.</P>
<P>THAT moral duties are <HI>the weightier matters of the law</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxiii. 23.</NOTE>, and of higher and more indi&s;pen|&s;ible obligation than any po&s;itive and external duty, none but the &s;uper&s;titious will deny. It is &s;o plain and &s;o certain a truth, that even the &s;uper&s;titious generally rather act in contra|diction to it, than explicitly deny it. But on this obvious and important truth, error may be grafted. By this principle, &s;ome who pro|fe&s;s to believe the go&s;pel, think them&s;elves authori&s;ed to pronounce, that a regard to ex|ternal wor&s;hip and ritual duties, is not at all e&s;&s;ential to a good and worthy character; and to be&s;tow the highe&s;t applau&s;e on per&s;ons who&s;e benevolence and moral integrity they reckon unexceptionable, without any abatement for their totally neglecting all the po&s;itive appoint|ments
<PB N="311" REF="310">
of Chri&s;tianity. Nay a punctual ob|&s;ervance of the&s;e, they would perhaps con&s;ider as taking &s;omething from the character, as implying weakne&s;s and &s;uper&s;tition, if not hy|pocri&s;y. This judgment is pronounced by &s;uch per&s;ons as think them&s;elves at liberty to neg|lect po&s;itive duties, provided they adhere to moral virtue. The principles of conduct which we adopt for our&s;elves, always influence our &s;entiments of others.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of the influence of oppo&s;ite principles of conduct, the generality of Chri&s;|tians form a very different judgment. I &s;peak not of the &s;uper&s;titious, who de&s;pi&s;e morality, and fooli&s;hly re&s;t in outward rites as the whole of religion: it is natural for them to reckon a &s;crupulous ob&s;ervance of rites, a compen&s;a|tion for moral goodne&s;s in other men, as well as in them&s;elves. But even they whom all except the impious will acquit from the charge of &s;uper&s;tition; they who, both in principle and in practice, acknowledge the great &s;upe|riority of moral to po&s;itive duties, but yet e&s;teem the&s;e latter al&s;o of high obligation; nay all who have a genuine and deep &s;en&s;e of re|ligion, not only judge a regard to its po&s;itive in&s;titutions ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to complete a worthy character; but even pa&s;s a &s;everer cen|&s;ure on a total di&s;regard to the&s;e, or a very
<PB N="312" REF="311">
great neglect of them, than on &s;ome tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of moral obligation, and reckon it a more certain &s;ign of an unprincipled and gracele&s;s character.</P>
<P>THIS judgment &s;eems, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the acknowledged preference due to moral duties: the unbelieving and un|godly a&s;cribe it, without he&s;itation, to &s;uper|&s;tition: and as it is adopted by &s;erious Chri&s;|tians in general, and even &s;upported by the declarations of &s;cripture and the &s;pirit of re|vealed religion, they con&s;idently urge it as a proof, That revealed religion and po&s;itive precepts nece&s;&s;arily fo&s;ter &s;uper&s;tition, and lead men to undervalue morality. It will be u&s;e|ful, therefore, to account for this judgment without re&s;olving it into &s;uper&s;tition; to &s;hew that it is ju&s;t and well founded, and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;uperiority of moral virtue, to all po&s;itive duties; to evince that notwith|&s;tanding this &s;uperiority, a <HI>great</HI> neglect of the latter, is really ba&s;er and more blameable than <HI>&s;ome</HI> defects in the former. It will tend to invali|date a plau&s;ible objection again&s;t the genius, and con&s;equently the divinity of Chri&s;tianity, and to correct &s;entiments which many Chri&s;tians have, e&s;pecially in this age, heedle&s;sly borrowed from infidelity. With a view to the&s;e important purpo&s;es, I &s;hall, in the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, en|dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">our to prove, That a total di&s;regard to the
<PB N="313" REF="312">
po&s;itive and external duties of religion, or a very great neglect of them, is ju&s;tly reckoned more blameable, and a &s;tronger evidence of an unprincipled character, than even &s;ome tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions of moral obligation: and afterwards I &s;hall apply the &s;ubject to the direction of our practice.</P>
<P>I BEGIN with ob&s;erving that po&s;itive in&s;ti|tutions in general, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from parti|cular rites, have really the nature of moral commandments. No one particular mode of external wor&s;hip is of moral obligation; but to wor&s;hip God externally is a duty of moral obligation, &s;uitable to our compound frame and our embodied &s;tate, and &s;o obviou&s;ly di&s;|cernible by the light of nature, that it has been acknowledged by the univer&s;al practice of mankind in every age and every nation. But the man who totally and con&s;tantly neglects po&s;itive duties, does not at all wor&s;hip God externally; and con&s;equently tran&s;gre&s;&s;es a moral obligation, and is ju&s;tly c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;urable as, in that re&s;pect, immoral and vicious.</P>
<P>BESIDES, even particular po&s;itive precepts, as &s;oon as they are given by God, have &s;ome|thing moral in their nature. Suppo&s;e the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ites which are enjoined by them, perfectly indif|ferent before they were enjoined; yet from
<PB N="314" REF="313">
that moment they cea&s;e to be indifferent. The divine authority is interpo&s;ed for the ob&s;ervance of them. To neglect them, is no longer to forbear an indifferent action, or to do a thing in one way rather than in another, which has naturally no greater propriety: it is very dif|ferent; it is to di&s;obey God, it is to de&s;pi&s;e his authority, it is to re&s;i&s;t his will. Can any man believe a God, and not acknowledge that di&s;obedience to him and contempt of his au|thority is immoral, and far from the lea&s;t heinous &s;pecies of immorality? To condemn the per&s;on, therefore, who neglects the external wor&s;hip of God and the po&s;itive in&s;titutions of his will, and to condemn him for this neglect more &s;everely than for &s;ome other vices, is not weakne&s;s, is not &s;uper&s;tition, is not to give rites the preference to moral virtue: it is only to proportion our &s;entiments to the compara|tive moment of different moral virtues; it is only to pronounce that obedience to the great Lawgiver of the univer&s;e is a very &s;acred and important virtue; it is only to judge con&s;i&s;t|ently with the belief of a God.</P>
<P>To render this &s;till plainer, it may be ob|&s;erved, that po&s;itive duties are <HI>expre&s;&s;ions</HI> of af|fections and di&s;po&s;itions morally good. The heart is the &s;eat both of virtue and of vice: but every virtue and every vice &s;eated in the
<PB N="315" REF="314">
heart, nece&s;&s;arily exerts it&s;elf in corre&s;pondent outward actions. We perceive only the&s;e ac|tions; from them we infer the virtue or vice of the heart; and we be&s;tow upon the cha|racter a degree of approbation or of di&s;appro|bation &s;uited to the virtue or the vice which we have found rea&s;on to infer. Our exact ob|&s;ervance of po&s;itive rites owned by us to be of divine appointment, &s;hews in general a temper of &s;ubjection and obedience to God; the neg|lect of &s;uch rites &s;hews the want or the weak|ne&s;s of this temper. Every particular religious rite is fit al&s;o for expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome particular good affection; thank&s;giving is an exertion of gratitude, prayer of dependence, interce&s;&s;ion of benevolence: and if the good affection be vigorous in the heart, it will break forth into &s;uch exertion. The neglect therefore of all external wor&s;hip and po&s;itive duties, indicates the want, and great remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in them pro|claims the weakne&s;s, of all the good affections which would have been exerci&s;ed in perform|ing them; and the man who indulges him&s;elf in that remi&s;&s;ne&s;s or neglect, we with rea&s;on con&s;ider as void of the&s;e affections. They are among the mo&s;t amiable affections in human nature; they &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to the mo&s;t dete&s;table vices: on the per&s;on, therefore, who, either by his neglect of the po&s;itive in&s;titutions and external duties of religion, or by any
<PB N="316" REF="315">
other means, &s;hews him&s;elf to be de&s;titute of the&s;e affections, not to pa&s;s a heavy cen&s;ure, would demon&s;trate a great perver&s;ion of judg|ment. For to be de&s;titute of the&s;e affections, is a deeper depravity than that which is fixed upon the character by &s;ome immediate tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions of moral laws. When we cen&s;ure it more &s;everely than &s;uch tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, we only look beyond the outward action which indi|cates it, and which is neither good nor evil, con&s;idered merely in it&s;elf; we ab&s;tract from &s;uch circum&s;tances of the action as are not e&s;|&s;ential, we con&s;ider it &s;imply as a <HI>&s;ign</HI> of in|ward moral temper; and we e&s;timate the cha|racter according to that inward temper, which alone can be of importance in determining it.</P>
<P>FARTHER, all po&s;itive in&s;titutions of di|vine appointment, are <HI>means</HI> of cultivating moral virtue. Be the rites them&s;elves what they will, their being enjoined by God, ren|ders them proper trials of our obedience to him, and renders our ob&s;ervance of them the means of cheri&s;hing a &s;en&s;e of his authority, and of improving a principle of &s;ubjection to it. A principle of &s;ubjection to the authority of God, is one of the firme&s;t &s;upports of all goodne&s;s and virtue: and po&s;itive in&s;titutions are the mo&s;t direct means of cultivating it; for the ob&s;ervance of them proceeds &s;olely from
<PB N="317" REF="316">
the principle of obedience; but in every moral virtue, other principles are conjoined with this. All the rites appointed by God, are likewi&s;e direct and very powerful means of improving many particular virtuous affections, all the affections which are naturally exerci&s;ed in performing them. Neglect of the means demon&s;trates, in every ca&s;e, indifference about the end. Di&s;regard to external wor&s;hip and po&s;itive in&s;titutions, &s;hews the want of all con|cern for moral improvement. But uncon|cernedne&s;s for moral improvement is not the defect of a &s;ingle virtue, is not a &s;ingle vice; it is a corruption and degeneracy of the whole &s;oul, and therefore mu&s;t appear highly de|te&s;table to every per&s;on of &s;ound and unbia&s;&s;ed judgment, much more highly dete&s;table than &s;ome tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of a &s;ingle moral law.</P>
<P>AGAIN, when men indulge them&s;elves in the neglect of po&s;itive duties, their acts of neg|lect are more frequent, more con&s;tant, and bear a greater proportion to their acts of per|formance, than the acts of immediate immo|rality which, even in very vicious per&s;ons, fall under the notice of ob&s;ervers. But it is un|que&s;tionably ju&s;t to pa&s;s a &s;everer cen&s;ure on a long and uninterrupted multitude of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, though each of them, taken by it|&s;elf, be not very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">einous, than on a few acts
<PB N="318" REF="317">
of vice, each of which &s;ingly is greater than any one of the others. This con&s;ideration actually has great influence on the judgment now under examination: for on the one hand, it is only the total or the very great neglect of po&s;itive in&s;titutions, that men pronounce incon&s;i&s;tent with all principle and goodne&s;s; &s;maller degrees of neglect we treat with greater indulgence, than almo&s;t any immediate tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of moral law: and on the other hand, when a man lives in the frequent or the con|tinual practice of any direct immorality, we con&s;ider him as abandoned to that vice, and never fail to blame his conduct more highly than we blame any neglect of po&s;itive in&s;ti|tutions.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be added, that the neglect of po|&s;itive duties is more obvious to &s;pectators, than many tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of moral obligation. The&s;e latter are &s;ometimes indefinite and ambiguous; the actions from which we infer a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, are in &s;ome degree equivocal, and capable of different con&s;tructions: but the neglect of a po&s;itive in&s;titution, is an act ab&s;olutely deter|minate, which can neither be palliated nor ex|plained away. Men therefore pa&s;s their cen|&s;ure upon it without he&s;itation: and the a&s;|&s;urance and readine&s;s with which they pa&s;s it|gives their judgment greater firmne&s;s and force,
<PB N="319" REF="318">
and more appearance of &s;everity, than the judg|ments have, which they pronounce with he|&s;itation, concerning tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of moral obligation, more indeterminate or equivocal.</P>
<P>FINALLY, with re&s;pect to almo&s;t every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of moral obligation, there is &s;ome natural pa&s;&s;ion, which directly and univer&s;ally proves a temptation to it. We of cour&s;e think of this temptation along with the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and a &s;en&s;e of its &s;trength, and of the difficulty of re&s;i&s;ting it, mitigates our cen&s;ure. Any vicious pa&s;&s;ion may, accidentally and in a par|ticular in&s;tance, oppo&s;e the ob&s;ervance of a po|&s;itive in&s;titution: but there is no one natural pa&s;&s;ion which &s;tands directly and in all ca&s;es in oppo&s;ition to the performance of po&s;itive duties. Con&s;equently there is no univer&s;al temptation to the total or habitual neglect of them, in the view of mankind, when they pa&s;s their cen&s;ure on the per&s;on who indulges him&s;elf in that neglect: and therefore they pa&s;s it without mitigation or abatement.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations duly weighed will be &s;ufficient to vindicate the &s;evere judgment pa&s;&s;ed by the bulk of Chri&s;tians, concerning the character of tho&s;e per&s;ons who habitually or totally di&s;regard the po&s;itive in&s;titutions of religion.

This judgment proceeds not from &s;uper&s;tition; it is founded in nature, it is confirmed by the cleare&s;t principles of &s;ound rea&s;on. It is not they who reckon a regard to po&s;itive in&s;titu|tions e&s;&s;ential to a good and unblemi&s;hed cha|racter, that judge weakly, but they who reckon that regard of no importance.

Your religion does bind you to hold the contrary judgment; and in doing &s;o, it perfectly coin|cides

with rea&s;on: it fo&s;ters not &s;uper&s;tition; it prohibits irreligion: it &s;ets not morality a&s;ide; but it completes it, and makes a provi&s;ion for its &s;upport, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in our pre&s;ent embodied &s;tate. The high regard which Chri&s;|tianity demands to external wor&s;hip, can be no pre&s;umption that it is an impo&s;ture: on the contrary, its entire coincidence with rea&s;on in demanding this regard, con&s;i&s;tently with the acknowledged &s;uperiority of moral virtue, and even in &s;ub&s;ervience to it, is a mark of its de|&s;cent from that God who endued men with rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE ob&s;ervations which we have made in this di&s;cour&s;e, tend no le&s;s to direct our prac|tice, than to regulate our judgment, with re|&s;pect to the moral and the po&s;itive precepts of religion. They &s;erve to re&s;train us from both the extremes to which mankind have always &s;hewn a propen&s;ity.</P>
<P>THEY warn us, on the one hand, again&s;t indulging our&s;elves in the neglect of the po&s;i|tive appointments of Chri&s;tianity, under a pre|tence of adhering &s;olely to morality. They demon&s;trate this neglect, &s;o incompatible with the whole tenor of the go&s;pel, to be, on &s;up|po&s;ition of the truth of the go&s;pel, no le&s;s in|compatible with rea&s;on, and a heinous viola|tion
<PB N="322" REF="321">
of morality it&s;elf. Moral duties are far more excellent than po&s;itive: whenever, in a particular &s;ituation, we cannot perform both, unque&s;tionably we ought to prefer the former; but whenever there is no &s;uch incon&s;i&s;tence, it is equally unque&s;tionable that the obligation of the latter is &s;acred and indi&s;pen&s;ible. Such incon&s;i&s;tence is very rare: how &s;eldom does our &s;ituation enable us hone&s;tly to &s;ay, that we could not have attended upon external wor|&s;hip without neglecting &s;ome moral duty? How &s;eldom is the &s;uperiority of virtue to ex|ternal rites at all applicable to our &s;ituation, or capable of being pleaded as an excu&s;e for our omitting the&s;e? The omi&s;&s;ion generally pro|ceeds from very di&s;&s;imilar cau&s;es; from in&s;en|&s;ibility to the authority of God's laws, from weakne&s;s of the religious affections, from in|difference about &s;piritual improvement, indif|ference about improvement in that very mo|rality, for which we pretend &s;o ardent a zeal. No doubt there may be ju&s;t rea&s;ons for omit|ting a po&s;itive duty at a particular time. But what then? Will this excu&s;e our omitting it when there is no ju&s;t rea&s;on? There may be rea&s;ons al&s;o for omitting a particular exerci&s;e of moral virtue: peculiar circum&s;tances may make that cea&s;e to be our duty at one time, which is our duty at other times. Will it therefore follow that moral virtue may be neg|lected
<PB N="323" REF="322">
when no &s;uch peculiar circum&s;tances exi&s;t? In the former ca&s;e it is, as really as in the latter, a point of con&s;cience whether the rea&s;ons which actually move us to the omi&s;&s;ion, are ju&s;t and valid. For the frequent omi&s;&s;ion of po&s;itive duties, much more for the habitual and con&s;tant neglect of them, there cannot po&s;|&s;ibly be any ju&s;t or valid rea&s;on: it is ab&s;olutely inexcu&s;able; it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the belief of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>BUT let us be likewi&s;e careful to guard again&s;t the oppo&s;ite extreme. While we &s;hun irreligion, let us with equal caution avoid &s;uper&s;tition. Though a regard to po&s;itive duties be nece&s;&s;ary for completing a worthy character, yet a regard to them alone will con|tribute very little to worthine&s;s of character. To perform them without a religious temper, is ba&s;e hypocri&s;y; to perform them without moral improvement, is unprofitable &s;uper&s;ti|tion; to reckon the performance of them a compen&s;ation for the neglect of any virtue, an atonement for any vice, is de&s;tructive imprety. All the principles from which we have been rea&s;oning, imply the &s;uperiority of moral vir|tue; it is from the indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation and the excellence of this, that we have de|duced all our proofs of the &s;acred obligation of po&s;itive in&s;titutions. As they who <HI>di&s;regard</HI>
<PB N="324" REF="323">
the&s;e, neglect the nece&s;&s;ary means and the na|tural expre&s;&s;ions of religion, &s;o they who <HI>re&s;t</HI> in them, de&s;pi&s;e its principle and its &s;ub&s;tance. While we are not negligent in ob&s;erving any in&s;titution of our religion, let us be diligent in practi&s;ing every virtue.</P>
<P>RELIGION is of a complex nature. It in|cludes things of different kinds; it includes articles of faith, and rules of practice; it in|cludes precepts of a moral, and precepts of a po&s;itive kind: all the&s;e are e&s;&s;ential to it, and each of them has its proper place and dig|nity. We ought not to &s;eparate them; we ought not unduly to exalt one, and depre&s;s the re&s;t. The Phari&s;ees, in our Saviour's time, undervalued and neglected moral duties, and hoped to expiate the neglect by a very &s;cru|pulous compliance not only with po&s;itive pre|cepts of divine appointment, but al&s;o with &s;uper&s;titions of their own invention. For this our Saviour often reproved them with great &s;everity. The contrary extreme he had &s;carce|ly an opportunity of reproving profe&s;&s;edly; none of the Jews imagined it lawful to neg|lect the ritual of their religion; it is among Chri&s;tians that this incon&s;i&s;tent ab&s;urdity has been introduced by the contagion of infidelity. Yet in reproving the Phari&s;ees, he has &s;uf|ficiently put us on our guard again&s;t this ex|treme.
<PB N="325" REF="324">
While he declares the &s;uperior excel|lence of moral virtue, and inculcates the careful practice of it, as indi&s;pen&s;ible, he is far from vilifying po&s;itive duties of God's ap|pointment, he incul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ates the ob&s;ervance of them al&s;o, as truly nece&s;&s;ary.

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>EPH. v. 16.</BIBL>
<Q>Redeeming the time.&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is the prerogative of man's rea&s;onable nature, to be capable of looking backward to the pa&s;t, and forward to the future. It is this capacity that qualifies us for forming &s;ome judgment of the future, and for directing our conduct in it, by the experience which we have acquired in time pa&s;t. Our acting this part is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the prudent ma|nagement of our worldly bu&s;ine&s;s. It is equally nece&s;&s;ary in religion; and, as &s;ub&s;ervient to re|ligious prudence, it is incomparably more im|portant, becau&s;e religion is our principal con|cern.</P>
<P>To reflect on the pa&s;t part of our lives, ex|tending our thoughts at the &s;ame time to the
<PB N="328" REF="326">
future part of them; and from that reflection, to collect maxims for the regulation of our fu|ture conduct, is a very powerful means of re|ligious improvement. It is to <HI>redeem the time,</HI> that we may <HI>walk circum&s;pectly, not as &s;ools, but as wi&s;e.</HI> It is an exerci&s;e which we ought to perform frequently, but which we are very apt to neglect. For preventing the neglect, we &s;hould take advantage of the &s;everal di|&s;tinctions of time, and at the end of each of them recollect our demeanour through the cour&s;e of it, for our direction in the next. It is an excellent advice to this purpo&s;e, which an ancient philo&s;opher gave to his &s;cholars; At the end of every day, to recollect all the actions of it, that if they had done any thing ami&s;s, they might amend it next day, and that if they had done any thing well, they might enjoy the comfort of it. When a heathen re|commended this to be practi&s;ed every day, may not they blu&s;h to call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, who practi&s;e it &s;carcely any day? Such daily recollection, uniformly per&s;i&s;ted in, could not fail to produce the happie&s;t effects. A little time only could indeed, by the generality, be be&s;towed upon it every day: but, if it were practi&s;ed every day, a very little time would &s;oon become &s;ufficient for it. Even in this ca&s;e however, it would not be &s;uperfluous, at the end of larger periods of our time, particularly
<PB N="329" REF="327">
of the years which divide our lives, to &s;urvey at greater lei&s;ure the manner in which we have employed them; to con&s;ider more deliberately how we may render the occurrences of them &s;ub&s;ervient to our improvement; and to re|&s;olve more explicitly that we will render them &s;ub&s;ervient to it. But the more negligent we have been in daily recollection, the more ne|ce&s;&s;ary it is that we &s;hould deliberately reflect upon our conduct at &s;tated times.</P>
<P>ONE year is ju&s;t expired; only a few days of another year are yet elap&s;ed. If we have begun this year with the practice now men|tioned, it is well. If we have not, it is not yet too late: we are yet alive, though even in the&s;e few days many of our fellow-men, and &s;ome it may be of our neighbours, have been &s;natched away by death. Let us &s;eize the opportunity while we have it: how &s;oon it may be lo&s;t, God only knows. While we yet live, let us look back upon our pa&s;t con|duct, that we may learn to <HI>redeem the time.</HI> Thus the apo&s;tle exhorted the Ephe&s;ians; and thus he exhorteth every one of us. The Ephe&s;ians had but lately heard the go&s;pel preached, having, for the greate&s;t part of their lives, been heathens, <HI>dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, wherein they walked, according to the cour&s;e of</HI>
<PB N="330" REF="328">
<HI>this world</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. ii. 1, 2.</NOTE>: the apo&s;tle con&s;iders all that part of their lives as lo&s;t, and directs them to <HI>re|deem</HI> it, to buy it back. Though we were born Chri&s;tians, we al&s;o have lo&s;t a great part of our pa&s;t time, <HI>having a name that we lived, we have been dead</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 1.</NOTE>: let us too buy back our time.</P>
<P>THERE is a &s;en&s;e, in which every man would gladly buy back his pa&s;t time. When old age has come upon us, when feeblene&s;s has run through our frame, when di&s;ea&s;e racks us, who would not willingly recover the &s;ea&s;on of youth, health, and vigour? The &s;en&s;uali&s;t, when plea&s;ure begins to lo&s;e its reli&s;h, or when he can no longer find opportunity and means of gratification, wi&s;hes that he could recall the opportunities and the enjoyments which he once had, and ta&s;te his &s;en&s;uality anew. The worldling would rejoice, if he could recall his former opportunities of making gain. The &s;or|rowful and the un&s;ucce&s;sful periods of life, we would readily abandon: but all the hours which have been chearful, pro&s;perous, or &s;uc|ce&s;sful, we would be de&s;irous of redeeming, and living over again. In &s;uch ways to <HI>re|deem the time,</HI> would be only to have it in our power again to mi&s;-&s;pend it, or at be&s;t to em|ploy
<PB N="331" REF="329">
it for mere worldly purpo&s;es. To redeem it in &s;uch ways, is impo&s;&s;ible: time once pa&s;t is irrecoverable; the very late&s;t moments of the la&s;t year, and of ye&s;terday, are already as much beyond our reach, as the years and days which were before the flood. The only way in which we can <HI>redeem the time,</HI> is to employ the future better than we have employed the pa&s;t; it is, from the experience of the pa&s;t, to learn to act more wi&s;ely for the time to come, correcting the faults which we have formerly committed, pur&s;uing the improvements which we have hitherto neglected, and u&s;ing the opportunities which we have often carele&s;sly let &s;lip.</P>
<P>FOR our thus redeeming the time, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to look back to the pa&s;t, with a re&s;o|lution to apply it to the direction of the fu|ture. That we therefore may thus redeem the time, let us in the beginning of this year, review our pa&s;t time, and particularly our pa&s;t year, on purpo&s;e to learn how we may make a better u&s;e of our time, in the pre&s;ent year, and in all our future years. That we may review it with the greater di&s;tinctne&s;s, and with the greater advantage, let us con&s;ider our pa&s;t time:</P>
<P>FIRST, In re&s;pect of it&s;elf;</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="330">SECONDLY, In re&s;pect of the events which it brought along with it; and</P>
<P>THIDLY, In re&s;pect of the manner in which we have employed it.</P>
<P>FIRST, Let us con&s;ider our pa&s;t time in re&s;pect of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>TIME con&s;idered &s;imply in it&s;elf, is a tru&s;t committed to us by God; and it is a mo&s;t important tru&s;t, and committed to us for the mo&s;t important of all purpo&s;es, for providing for eternity, for avoiding the mi&s;ery of hell, and for obtaining the everla&s;ting joys of hea|ven. Our time is &s;hort; it is likewi&s;e &s;o un|certain that we know not but it may expire in a &s;ingle hour: its &s;hortne&s;s and uncertainty render it a tru&s;t the more important; for &s;till it is the only &s;ea&s;on allowed us for &s;ecuring our everla&s;ting intere&s;ts. Being &s;o important, time ought not to be wa&s;ted. Whenever the care of our &s;ouls is neglected, time is wa&s;ted, about whatever el&s;e it has been employed. Plea&s;ure is alluring; innocent plea&s;ure we are not required to refu&s;e: riches are convenient; by hone&s;t means we are allowed to pur&s;ue them: honour and power are de&s;irable; we are not forbidden to a&s;pire after them with mo|deration. But in the pur&s;uit neither of plea|&s;ure,
<PB N="333" REF="331">
nor of riches, nor of power and honour, ought our whole time to be employed: it ought to be employed chiefly in &s;eeking after the delights, the trea&s;ures, the dignities, the glories of immortality.</P>
<P>TO which of the&s;e pur&s;uits has your pa&s;t time, to which of them has your la&s;t year been devoted?

&mdash;Or, it may be, you have retired from bu&s;ine&s;s, or had intervals of lei&s;ure. The&s;e gave you opportunity for entering into your|&s;elves, for con&s;idering your ways, for &s;trength|ening virtuous principles, for deepening reli|gious impre&s;&s;ions in your hearts.

Improve it always for the&s;e purpo&s;es.&mdash;You have lived from year to year in affluence, or you have been pro&s;perous la&s;t year, and found your wealth increa&s;ed.

of your darling children. This year the &s;ame happine&s;s may continue. It is one of the &s;weete&s;t joys of human life. It calls for the fervours of thank&s;giving, the ardours of &s;ocial love, and the chearfulle&s;t alertne&s;s in practi&s;ing all our duties.&mdash;But la&s;t year has wounded the hearts of &s;ome of you with pun|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nt &s;orrow for the unkindne&s;s of relations, the cruelty of acquaintance, the death of the re|vered parent, the &s;upporting hu&s;band, the &s;oothing wife, the plea&s;ant child, or the be|loved friend.

<P>2.

Every year and every day of our lives expo&s;es us to temptations: and to reflect on the temptations to which we have hitherto been expo&s;ed, will both enable us to form a ju&s;t judgment concerning the pa&s;t, and &s;erve for our direction in the future. Our tempta|tions have been either re&s;i&s;ted or complied with: from con&s;idering deliberately, whether we have re&s;i&s;ted them or complied with them, we may derive great advantage. Have we re|&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="341" REF="339">
them? Have we avoided the vices into which they would have led us? Have we per|&s;i&s;ted in practi&s;ing the duties which they &s;oli|cited us to neglect? So far we have been conquerors; and may rejoice in our victory: we have improved the time; let us continue to improve it. It will be &s;hameful to fall at length before the enemy whom we have often vanqui&s;hed, and to fall before him after, by frequent victories, he has been weakened, and we have been &s;trengthened. Yet even our for|mer victories may contribute to our falling: they may render us confident, pre&s;umptuous, and negligent. Guard again&s;t this abu&s;e of your &s;ucce&s;s. Let the difficulty which you experienced in re&s;i&s;ting former temptations, pre|&s;erve you vigilant, and ever mindful of the nece&s;&s;ity of caution and exertion. Whatever were the means which contributed to your &s;uc|ce&s;s in pa&s;t in&s;tances, employ the &s;ame means in every future hour of trial.&mdash;But of the temp|tations which have a&s;&s;aulted us, how many have prevailed again&s;t us! What have the&s;e been? Into what &s;ins have they betrayed us? By what means did they &s;educe us? The exa|mination of the&s;e particulars will be unplea|&s;ant: it will force upon us an humiliating &s;en&s;e of our own weakne&s;s; it will fill us with re|mor&s;e for our guilt. But without &s;ubmitting to it, we mu&s;t continue to be vanqui&s;hed in
<PB N="342" REF="340">
every trial, to degenerate more and more, and become the &s;laves of &s;in. Tho&s;e periods of time in which we have corrupted our&s;elves by yielding to temptations, we have very great need to redeem. We can redeem them, only by re&s;i&s;ting the&s;e temptations when they again attack us, and by re&s;i&s;ting every temptation for the future, more &s;trenuou&s;ly than we have re&s;i&s;ted any in time pa&s;t. To this, the recol|lection and the permanent &s;en&s;e of our former defeats will be &s;ub&s;ervient, by rendering us diffident of our&s;elves, circum&s;pect, dependent on the grace of God, <HI>in&s;tant in prayer</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 12.</NOTE> for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, careful to fly from temptations, &s;u&s;|picious of the arts by which we have been for|merly beguiled, jealous of the inadvertencies by which we have given &s;in an advantage again&s;t us.</P>
<P>EVERY place is full of temptations, every &s;ea&s;on abounds with them. Every man, ac|cording to his peculiar circum&s;tances, has his own temptations, again&s;t which he is chiefly concerned to defend him&s;elf: his &s;ituation either puts him in danger of committing &s;ome particular &s;ins, or expo&s;es him to &s;ome parti|cular mode of &s;eduction. By reflecting on the variety of our pa&s;t conditions, each of us may
<PB N="343" REF="341">
bring to his remembrance the temptations to which he in particular has been expo&s;ed. Youth and high health contain temptations to levity, to di&s;&s;ipation, to unlawful plea&s;ure, to thought|le&s;&s;ne&s;s about death and eternity. Sickne&s;s puts us in danger of peevi&s;hne&s;s, murmuring, and impatience. A bu&s;y life is apt to render men worldly-minded, intent upon earthly things, regardle&s;s of God and religion. A life of idlene&s;s, or even of lei&s;ure, leads men into exce&s;&s;ive or unlawful amu&s;ement, and into all the vices which &s;pring from the want of good employment. A &s;tate of pro&s;perity and a&s;|fluence contains temptations to pride, in&s;olence, pre&s;umption, luxury, in&s;en&s;ibility to the mi|&s;eries of mankind. Poverty leads to di&s;con|tent, anxiety, complaints again&s;t Providence, abjectne&s;s of &s;pirit, or di&s;hone&s;ty. The temp|tations belonging to the &s;everal &s;ituations in which you have hitherto been placed, each of you for him&s;elf &s;hould recollect; that, if you have re&s;i&s;ted them, you may know how to re|&s;i&s;t them &s;till, and thus improve your future time; that if you have yielded to them, you may henceforth redeem the time, by no longer yielding to them.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, We may con&s;ider our pa&s;t time in re&s;pect of the manner in which we have employed it. It was impo&s;&s;ible to exclude this
<PB N="344" REF="342">
view of it altogether, under the former head; for events are what give occa&s;ion for particular in&s;tances of behaviour, and our behaviour has always a congruity to the &s;ituations in which we are placed: but it will throw new light on the &s;ubject, and give farther direction for our <HI>redeeming the time,</HI> to &s;urvey the pa&s;t part of it, as either <HI>well-employed,</HI> or <HI>ill-employed,</HI> or <HI>trifled away.</HI></P>
<P>1. OUR pa&s;t time and our la&s;t year may have been <HI>well-employed.</HI> Let each of us examine him&s;elf, what part of it he has employed well. The bu&s;ine&s;s of this life is to make preparation for the next. Whatever time we have &s;pent in the practice of any virtue, has been well &s;pent; it has been &s;pent for the great purpo&s;e of our being. While we are practi&s;ing any virtue, we are going directly forward towards heaven: <HI>the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>the way everla&s;ting</HI> is the &s;ame. The hours which we have em|ployed in &s;incere devotion, in praying to God, in prai&s;ing him, in adoring the perfections of his nature, in humbling our&s;elves before him, confe&s;&s;ing our &s;ins, exerci&s;ing repentance and exciting our&s;elves to amendment under a &s;en&s;e of his immediate and awful pre&s;ence; the hours in which our hearts have been truly en|gaged in the&s;e duties, in &s;ecret, in our fami|lies, or in the public a&s;&s;emblies of Chri&s;tians;
<PB N="345" REF="343">
the hours in which we have been indulging the &s;ilent workings of love, reverence, re&s;ig|nation towards God, or cheri&s;hing the&s;e pious affections by meditation and retirement from the world: all the&s;e hours have been well-em|ployed; they have been employed in &s;trength|ening and in exerci&s;ing the fir&s;t and noble&s;t of the virtues, the great principles of all right conduct, tho&s;e principles which alone can pre|&s;erve us &s;tedfa&s;t in good practice. The hours which we employed in &s;erious con&s;ideration of the great truths of our holy religion, of our &s;tate and our obligations, of the vanity of earthly things, of the frailty of life, of our latter end, of the important concerns of eter|nity: the&s;e have been well-employed; they have contributed to excite us to our principal bu&s;ine&s;s. The hours which you have &s;pent in controlling any of your appetites and pa&s;&s;ions: the hour in which you re&s;i&s;ted the allurements of plea&s;ure; the hour in which you &s;topped your ears again&s;t the licentious je&s;t or the <HI>cor|rupt communication</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;. iv. 29.

a ri&s;ing inclination to exce&s;s, recollected your|&s;elves, and made your e&s;cape from the com|pany which was running into riot: the hour in which you repre&s;&s;ed the motions of anger, the effu&s;ions of peevi&s;hne&s;s, the &s;ugge&s;tions of envy, the impul&s;es of malice or revenge: all the&s;e hours have been well-employed, employed in purifying your hearts from di&s;po&s;itions which would render you unfit for heaven, and trea|&s;ure up mi&s;ery and angui&s;h for you.

I will add, that the hours which you have &s;pent in your lawful calling, whatever it be, the hours in which you have carried on your ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s diligently, hone&s;tly, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly, have been well|&s;pent, and have promoted your eternal &s;alva|tion.&mdash;That part of your time which has been employed in &s;uch ways as the&s;e, &s;tands in little need of being <HI>redeemed;</HI> it has not been lo&s;t.

<P>2.

<P>3. A GREAT part of our pa&s;t time has been trifled away. It too needs to be redeemed. If it has not been abu&s;ed to bad purpo&s;es, yet it has not been u&s;ed to any good purpo&s;e. Whatever part of our time has contributed nothing to the improvement of our &s;ouls,
<PB N="350" REF="348">
though it has not been employed in corrupt|ing them; whatever part has not promoted our &s;alvation, though it has not directly coun|teracted it, has been trifled away. A very great part of our time is nece&s;&s;arily &s;pent in &s;uch a manner as can have no influence on our preparation for eternity. So far as this is nece&s;&s;ary, it is not blameable: it is but one in|&s;tance of the imperfection of our nature. In|fancy and childhood is the age of trifling: rea|&s;on is dormant; the &s;en&s;e of good and evil is but beginning to &s;hew it&s;elf; the faculties are too imperfectly opened for a ju&s;t concep|tion of things &s;piritual and eternal. Through all the periods of life, a con&s;iderable propor|tion of our time mu&s;t be &s;pent in &s;leep, in ex|erci&s;e, relaxation, and amu&s;ement, needful for the health and vigour of the body, as well as for the &s;oundne&s;s and alacrity of the mind. How great a part of your pa&s;t time has thus elap&s;ed? If in the&s;e things you have not ex|ceeded the bounds of moderation, it has pa&s;&s;ed innocently: but &s;till it has been no-wi&s;e &s;ub|&s;ervient to the important purpo&s;es of eternity. Since, then, &s;o great a part of our time has &s;lipped away, and mu&s;t continue to &s;lip away, without promoting the&s;e purpo&s;es, can we be too diligent in making the be&s;t u&s;e of tho&s;e parts of it which are capable of promoting them? But which of us can &s;ay, that we have
<PB N="351" REF="349">
&s;pent no more time than was nece&s;&s;ary, in the&s;e ways, or that we have wa&s;ted none of it in li&s;tle&s;s indolence, counting the tedious hours, and wi&s;hing that they would pa&s;s more &s;wiftly? What is the whole life of many, but one un|interrupted &s;eries of thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, levity, and di&s;&s;ipation? Does this become creatures who, amid&s;t all the avocations of this &s;hort life, mu&s;t make preparation for eternity? Re|deem the time which you have thus &s;auntered away, by henceforth &s;pending no more of your time unprofitably, than is ab&s;olutely un|avoidable. The hu&s;bandman or the artificer reckons only upon his working-days for mak|ing provi&s;ion for his family. The indu&s;trious merchant looks upon the hours as lo&s;t, that are diverted from his trade. Let your time be employed as con&s;tantly as po&s;&s;ible, in &s;ome profitable bu&s;ine&s;s, that you may avoid the folly and the temptations of idlene&s;s. Never indulge your&s;elves in relaxation and amu&s;e|ment, when you have a call to any u&s;eful office. Render your very relaxations, as far as their nature can permit, indirectly &s;ub&s;er|vient to your &s;alvation, by taking care that they be always &s;uch as render you fitter for tho&s;e employments which directly promote it.</P>
<P>I HAVE now endeavoured to a&s;&s;i&s;t and direct you in reviewing your pa&s;t time, &s;o that you
<PB N="352" REF="350">
may <HI>redeem</HI> it; that you may more than ever employ it for its proper end; that you may improve the opportunities which you have formerly neglected, and improve tho&s;e better which you have improved well already; that you may re&s;i&s;t the temptations to which you have formerly yielded, and continue to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e which you have hitherto re&s;i&s;ted; that you may per&s;i&s;t in employing your time well, in tho&s;e in&s;tances in which you have been ac|cu&s;tomed to employ it well; and that, by your future circum&s;pection and diligence, you may in &s;ome mea&s;ure retrieve tho&s;e parts of it which you have either mi&s;-&s;pent or trifled away.

excellence of his own character and office, <HI>&s;ay|ing, I am the light of the world</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 12.</NOTE>. The Pha|ri&s;ees cen&s;ured this as vain-glorious boa&s;ting, characteri&s;tical of an impo&s;tor; <HI>Thou beare&s;t record of thy&s;elf, thy record is not true</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 13.</NOTE>. He an&s;wers in the text, <HI>Though I bear record of my&s;elf, yet my record is true.</HI> The an&s;wer is not applicable only to that one occa&s;ion: it naturally implies this general &s;entiment; that Chri&s;t Je&s;us propo&s;ed and urged the evidences of his mi&s;&s;ion in a manner which, far from le&s;&s;ening their weight, makes an addition to it.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;carcely any te&s;t of truth, le&s;s am|biguous than this, That it becomes more unde|niable, the more &s;everely it is examined, and the more various the lights in which it is viewed. Chri&s;tianity has many features per|ceivable at fir&s;t &s;ight, which intimate its di|vine original: but every new atttitude in which it can be placed, di&s;covers additional marks of its divinity. The &s;trength of its &s;everal evidences con&s;idered in them&s;elves, has been often and fully di&s;played. The <HI>manner</HI> in which the&s;e evidences were at fir&s;t propo&s;ed, has not been &s;o commonly attended to. That that manner contains many &s;eparate pre&s;ump|tions of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, it &s;hall be the bu&s;ine&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;e to evince.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="354">IN pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to examine di&s;tinctly, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the man|ner in which Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles propo&s;ed the evidences of the go&s;pel <HI>originally;</HI> and <HI>&s;e|condly,</HI> the manner in which they propo&s;ed them in con&s;equence of <HI>oppo&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> LET us attend to the manner in which Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles propo&s;ed the evi|dences of the go&s;pel originally, that is, in ad|dre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e who had not yet &s;hewn preju|dices, or rai&s;ed objections again&s;t the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>IN this &s;ituation, they &s;imply <HI>exhibited</HI> the evidences of their mi&s;&s;ion, without either il|lu&s;trating their &s;trength by rea&s;oning, or &s;tudi|ou&s;ly preventing objections again&s;t them. They publi&s;hed doctrines really excellent; but they did not affect on every occa&s;ion, either to a&s;|&s;ert that they are excellent, or to affirm that their excellence proves their divinity. They wrought miracles actually attended with all the circum&s;tances which could contribute to their credibility, and to their force; but they were not at pains to &s;how by arguments, in what manner, or how much, the &s;everal circum|&s;tances contributed to the one purpo&s;e or to the other. In many in&s;tances, they di&s;covered their knowledge of the hearts of men, and they predicted future events; but they left
<PB N="358" REF="355">
men to conclude of them&s;elves from the&s;e in|&s;tances, that they had a divine mi&s;&s;ion; they &s;carcely ever drew the inference. They proved Je&s;us to be the Me&s;&s;iah, from ancient prophe|cies: but they proved it in the &s;imple&s;t man|ner; &s;ometimes by only appealing to the Old Te&s;tament in general; often by barely quoting a particular pa&s;&s;age; always without ju&s;tifying the application by &s;ubtile rea&s;oning. That this was uniformly their manner, in propo&s;ing the evidences of their mi&s;&s;ion originally, or to tho&s;e who did not directly &s;how a &s;pirit of op|po&s;ition, might be proved by a large detail of in&s;tances from the New Te&s;tament; but that would be tedious, and in this auditory it is not nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>BUT does not this repre&s;entation of their manner give countenance to an objection which has been urged again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, that it was not, in its fir&s;t publication, founded upon argument? It does not give countenance, &s;o much as in appearance, to this objection in the mo&s;t important &s;en&s;e of it: it implies not in the remote&s;t manner that Chri&s;tianity is not founded on, or, to &s;peak more properly, &s;upported by, ju&s;t and rational evidence; for the ob&s;ervations which we have made, relate not at all to the matter of the evidence, but merely to the manner of propo&s;ing it. But
<PB N="359" REF="356">
does it not give a colour for affirming at lea&s;t, that the evidence of the go&s;pel was propo&s;ed in an improper and imperfect manner? If it give a <HI>colour</HI> for this objection, it gives no more. This manner is no real pre&s;umption again&s;t the truth of Chri&s;tianity; on the con|trary, it is a &s;trong pre&s;umption for it.</P>
<P>IT is no pre&s;umption again&s;t the truth of Chri&s;tianity: for that manner was neither im|proper nor imperfect; it was &s;ufficient for producing belief, in the circum&s;tances in which it was u&s;ed. If the go&s;pel, in its fir&s;t publication, was not &s;upported by <HI>argument,</HI> it was notwith&s;tanding &s;upported by <HI>evidence.</HI> Evidence is different from rea&s;oning: evidence perceived is the immediate cau&s;e of belief; rea&s;oning is but one means of bringing men to perceive the evidence; and it is a means which is far from being nece&s;&s;ary in every ca&s;e. The &s;tronge&s;t conviction po&s;&s;ible is produced by &s;imple intuition. The evidence of natural and moral truths, and in general of all matters of fact, requires not a proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, in order to its being perceived: a fact is exhibited, and from it a conclu&s;ion concerning another fact is directly inferred: the natural con&s;titution of the mind determines us to make the inference, and to adopt it, without any compari&s;on of ideas. The evi|dences
<PB N="360" REF="357">
of the go&s;pel are facts, miracles for in|&s;tance, the perception of which leads the mind naturally to infer the truth of the go&s;pel. The facts are perceived without rea&s;oning; and when they are perceived, the conclu&s;ion is like|wi&s;e deduced without rea&s;oning. Natural evi|dence is, by the original formation of the &s;oul, adapted to the under&s;tanding; there are prin|ciples of belief e&s;&s;ential to man, on which it lays hold, and by means of which it pro|duces immediate conviction in the unperverted. Chri&s;t exhibited evidence in a way fit for ope|rating on the natural principles of belief; he made men to perceive the facts from which the truth of his mi&s;&s;ion directly followed: this was enough; it is the very method by which men are daily convinced in &s;imilar ca&s;es.</P>
<P>EVIDENCE of every kind admits rea&s;on|ing: the evidence of our religion is capable of copious illu&s;trations and defences by argu|ment. But it is in no ca&s;e nece&s;&s;ary in order to conviction, that a per&s;on attend to all the rea&s;onings of which the &s;ubject is &s;u&s;ceptible. If he perceive the evidence without them, it would be altogether &s;uperfluous. It de&s;erves to be remarked al&s;o, that the evidences of the go&s;pel do not appear in the very &s;ame light to us, in which they appeared to tho&s;e to whom they were originally propo&s;ed. Our &s;ituation
<PB N="361" REF="358">
differs from theirs in many circum&s;tances; and it is from the&s;e circum&s;tances that mo&s;t of the rea&s;onings ari&s;e, which have been introduced into the defence of Chri&s;tianity. For our con|viction, rea&s;oning may be nece&s;&s;ary: but it by no means follows, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for convincing <HI>them;</HI> their &s;ituation gave not the &s;ame occa&s;ion for it. To them the evidence was directly exhibited; if it was real and na|tural evidence, it would produce belief in them.</P>
<P>THEIR conviction would likewi&s;e be en|tirely rational. We are apt to regard nicety in canva&s;&s;ing evidence, and &s;crupulo&s;ity in ad|mitting it, with too favourable an eye. What renders a&s;&s;ent irrational, is its being yielded to improper evidence, not its being yielded readi|ly to &s;uch as is proper. A&s;&s;ent is always ra|tional, when it is yielded to real and ju&s;t evi|dence: the more readily it is yielded, it is the more rational. To be impo&s;ed upon by in|&s;ufficient evidence, &s;hows a defect of under&s;tand|ing: not to perceive natural evidence quickly, without a multitude of arguments and illu&s;tra|tions, &s;hews an equal defect. The &s;tomach is &s;ound when it dige&s;ts ea&s;ily by its own force: the eye is good when it perceives objects clearly without artificial a&s;&s;i&s;tances: true vigour of under&s;tanding is entirely &s;imilar. To tho&s;e who
<PB N="362" REF="359">
gave no &s;igns of their being di&s;tempered with incredulity, the evidences of Chri&s;tianity were &s;imply exhibited: this is no pre&s;umption again&s;t Chri&s;tianity; it was &s;ufficient for producing firm and rational belief in &s;uch.</P>
<P>THIS manner is in &s;everal ways a very &s;trong pre&s;umption for Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>FAR from implying that no real evidence was given, it nece&s;&s;arily implies that the evi|dence was &s;trong. The &s;tronge&s;t evidence in every kind operates mo&s;t quickly on the un|der&s;tanding: if evidence be weak or doubtful, its force cannot be at all perceived without the aid of rea&s;oning and illu&s;tration. It is certain that the evidence of the go&s;pel was at fir&s;t merely exhibited; it is equally certain that many were in fact convinced by the fir&s;t pro|po&s;al of it; it is therefore undeniable that its evidence was not only real, but al&s;o &s;trong. Men are very credulous, they often believe without ju&s;t evidenee: we confe&s;s it. But it is only when the want of evidence is concealed by &s;pecious rea&s;oning, or by &s;ome other arti|fice. This was not the ca&s;e in the original publication of the go&s;pel. If there had been any defect in its evidence, the defect mu&s;t have been perceived, for no means at all were u&s;ed to hide it. If the evidence had not been
<PB N="363" REF="360">
&s;trong, it could not po&s;&s;ibly have produced be|lief, for it was barely &s;hown. Very certain truths have been rejected, becau&s;e the proof of them was not &s;ufficiently urged: but there never was a fal&s;ehood &s;ucce&s;sfully inculcated by a naked and artle&s;s exhibition of pretended evidence.</P>
<P>AGAIN, This manner was the fitte&s;t po&s;|&s;ible for convincing the unprejudiced. The more &s;imply evidence can be propo&s;ed, con|&s;i&s;tently with clearne&s;s, the better it an&s;wers its end. Whenever rea&s;oning is not nece&s;&s;ary, it burdens the evidence, and perplexes the un|der&s;tanding. This is in a peculiar manner true of matters of fact, which we are naturally formed for inferring immediately, at a &s;ingle &s;tep; and it holds e&s;pecially when the bulk of mankind are addre&s;&s;ed. Propo&s;e to an ordi|nary man evidence really &s;uited to the nature of the &s;ubject; he a&s;&s;ents without he&s;itation: enter upon the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions which ing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nuity has introduced into every &s;ubject; he under&s;tands you not. Every man is m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">de capable of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ing convinced by real evidence; but many can|not comprehend the &s;ubt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ties of di&s;putation. Chri&s;tianity was intended for the u&s;e of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> generality, not for the entertainment of the curious. If its evidence was real, &s;imply to pre&s;ent it would mo&s;t effectually produce be|lief
<PB N="364" REF="361">
in an ordinary man: if it was not fit for producing belief when thus propo&s;ed, it was not adapted to the bulk of mankind. God has &s;uited its evidence to their powers; Chri&s;t has propo&s;ed it in the manner fitte&s;t for convincing them: by this it is declared, not ob&s;curely, that the go&s;pel is the offspring of the &s;ame wi&s;|dom which fixed the human con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THIS manner is likewi&s;e mo&s;t &s;uitable to the character of a divine teacher. It &s;ets Je&s;us in direct oppo&s;ition to impo&s;tors. They mag|nify &s;lender evidence: they can produce no better, and therefore they labour to per&s;uade men by every art, that what they have pro|duced is con&s;iderable. It becomes a teacher truly &s;ent from God, to give, on the con|trary, evidence of his mi&s;&s;ion, fit in its own nature for producing belief; and, con&s;cious of its inherent &s;trength, to propo&s;e it without &s;how. In Mahomet we find the former man|ner, in Chri&s;t the latter, in perfection: that looks very like impo&s;ture; this bears the un|equivocal features of truth. When a man a&s;|&s;erts at every turn, that his arguments are &s;trong, it is at lea&s;t &s;u&s;picious: one who has no de&s;ign to bias the judgment, propo&s;es his rea&s;ons, and leaves them to make their &s;trength to be felt. Simplicity of manner is always an
<PB N="365" REF="362">
indication of truth; and Je&s;us po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it in the highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>THIS &s;hows likewi&s;e that he was con&s;cions of his title to the character which he claimed. A per&s;on who knows that he intends to de|ceive, is naturally &s;u&s;picious. But Je&s;us di&s;|covers no anxiety to fore&s;ee and prevent dif|ficulties; and his apo&s;tles relate things as they knew them to be, without any appearance of concern about the con&s;equences. This is that hone&s;t confidence which flows naturally from integrity, which a deceiver never can put on: it proves them to be what they &s;aid they were.</P>
<P>SIMPLICITY of manner is moreover an indication of genuine dignity. Mahomet af|fected dignity; but it was of a fal&s;e kind, and it was totally mi&s;placed. He haughtily di&s;|dained to give evidence of his mi&s;&s;ion: to have given it, was ab&s;olutely incumbent on him. At the &s;ame time he made an o&s;tentation of evidence: it was in avoiding this, that true greatne&s;s would have appeared: this betrayed a littlene&s;s of mind; it &s;howed his dignity to be affected at other times, only to hide the want of evidence. Je&s;us a&s;&s;umed a high character: but his manner &s;howed that it belonged to him; it was a plain expre&s;&s;ion of it: he &s;u&s;tained it with natural ea&s;e, and unaffected maje&s;ty: he
<PB N="366" REF="363">
gave evidence very readily; he di&s;dained only to di&s;play it with parade and o&s;tentation: <HI>Truly this was the Son of God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxvii. 54.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>THUS the manner in which the evidences of the go&s;pel were originally propo&s;ed, contains many pre&s;umptions of its truth. They are &s;o &s;trong that, if you &s;uppo&s;e it fal&s;e, it mu&s;t appear unaccountable that ever that manner &s;hould have been adopted, and impo&s;&s;ible that ever it could have &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>BUT proper as this manner was, it did not &s;ecure Chri&s;tianity from oppo&s;ition. Vice and prejudice &s;ugge&s;ted many objections again&s;t its evidences; they were propo&s;ed to Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles; and they induced them to depart from their ordinary manner of &s;imply exhibit|ing evidence, and to adopt a different manner, the examination of which was the <HI>&s;econd</HI> part of our de&s;ign.</P>
<P>IN what manner, then, did Chri&s;t &s;upport his claim, when he addre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e who formed objections, or li&s;tened to them? He a&s;&s;erted his mi&s;&s;ion, and avowed his character, in the mo&s;t peremptory and explicit terms. In con|futing mens cavils, in illu&s;trating what had
<PB N="367" REF="364">
occa&s;ioned them, in correcting their mi&s;takes, in in&s;tilling ju&s;ter principles, he often gave a more ample exhibition of excellent doctrine: he a&s;&s;erted likewi&s;e that the go&s;pel is excel|lent; and he urged its excellence as a proof of its divinity. He reminded tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed him, of the miracles which he had wrought; he affirmed expre&s;sly and frequently, that they were wrought on purpo&s;e to prove his mi&s;&s;ion, and e&s;tabli&s;h his doctrine. It was denied that his miracles had force enough to prove that he came from God; they were even a&s;cribed to magic: he demon&s;trated the ab&s;urdity of the charge, and vindicated their force by clear and &s;olid argument. He moreover &s;howed in &s;everal in|&s;tances, that his miracles were direct evidences of the principal doctrines of his religion, as being actual, experienced exertions of the very powers which the&s;e doctrines a&s;cribed to him, or of the mo&s;t &s;imilar powers that could be rendered objects of &s;en&s;e. He often appealed in expre&s;s terms to particular ancient predic|tions, and &s;howed that they were fulfilled in him&s;elf. The Jews had formed a very inade|quate idea of the Me&s;&s;iah, and were hindered from perceiving that Je&s;us was he, by their overlooking &s;ome whole predictions, and &s;ome capital circum&s;tances in other predictions, con|cerning him: our Saviour pointed out the&s;e, and rea&s;oned from them, in order to perfect
<PB N="368" REF="365">
their idea of the Me&s;&s;iah, and remove their prejudices again&s;t him&s;elf. They ob&s;erved in Je&s;us &s;ome characters incon&s;i&s;tent with the conception of the Me&s;&s;iah, which they thought they had derived from the prophets: he &s;howed, that the&s;e characters were truly con&s;i&s;tent with the prophetical de&s;criptions of the Me&s;&s;iah, nay often that they were plainly included in them. They mi&s;&s;ed in him &s;ome characters which they a&s;cribed to the Me&s;&s;iah: he proved, &s;ometimes that he him&s;elf really had th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e characters, and at other times that their ex|pectation of finding them in the Me&s;&s;iah, pro|ceeded only from their ignorance of the true meaning of the prophecies. The oppo&s;ition which was made to him, led him not only to illu&s;trate and urge the evidences of his mi&s;&s;ion &s;eparately, but al&s;o to collect them together, and di&s;play their united force. Time will not allow me, either to produce examples of the&s;e &s;everal particulars, or to &s;how how clo&s;ely and with how great propriety the apo&s;tles imi|tated their ma&s;ter in all of them. We pro|ceed therefore to enquire, what advantages Chri&s;tianity has derived from this alteration in the manner of propo&s;ing its evidences.</P>
<P>BY means of this alteration, the truth of Chri&s;tianity is rendered more immediately evi|dent, and the defence of it ea&s;ier and &s;horter;
<PB N="369" REF="366">
for by it con&s;iderable difficulties are avoided, and plau&s;ible objections prevented. By claim|ing a divine mi&s;&s;ion &s;o frequently and &s;o ex|plicitly, Chri&s;t rendered it indi&s;putable that he intended his whole doctrine to &s;tand on the authority of a divine revelation. This has a very great and exten&s;ive influence on the man|ner of examining the truth of Chri&s;tianity: it makes it plain, that very many of the mo&s;t &s;pe|cious arguments of in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">idels are really nothing at all to the purpo&s;e; that no objection again&s;t any particular doctrines of Chri&s;tianity is of weight in the que&s;tion, except it &s;how that they cannot po&s;&s;ibly be true; that therefore the only que&s;tion is, whether Chri&s;t had in fact a divine mi&s;&s;ion, and that this can be le|gitimately determined in no other way but by a clo&s;e examination of the po&s;itive evidence produced. If this evidence is not directly con|futed, his authority is alone &s;ufficient for proving that any doctrine which in its nature may be true, is true; it demands our unre&s;erved a&s;|&s;ent to whatever he really taught. By his ex|pre&s;s declarations of the intention of his mi|racles, he has rendered their connexion with his doctrine obvious; no man can hone&s;tly overlook it, or repre&s;ent them as mere un|meaning acts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">kill or power. The fre|quency of his appeals to prophecy, removes all manner of difficulty in determining, whether he
<PB N="370" REF="367">
claimed the high character of the Me&s;&s;iah, or only that of an ordinary prophet. Every dif|ficulty in revelation is magnified by infidels, into an objection again&s;t it: Chri&s;tianity &s;tands clear of many difficulties by the manner of its publication; to a certain degree it is what in|fidels would wi&s;h: is this no indication of its truth? It is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, becau&s;e it could be accompli&s;hed, without forfeiting other great advantages, by no po&s;&s;ible means except the delicate and &s;ingular conjunction of contrary manners, which Je&s;us introduced.</P>
<P>As the manner in which he &s;upported his mi&s;&s;ion on occa&s;ion of oppo&s;ition, prevents &s;ome objections, &s;o it removes others. It gives us his own account of the nature and force of the evidences which he produced, and his own an&s;wers to &s;everal objections again&s;t them. Infidels have never confuted the&s;e; they have &s;carcely attempted it. Is this recon|cileable to candour? Is it not an acknowledg|ment of weakne&s;s? They ought to have begun with this; by neglecting it, they have left a &s;trong enemy behind, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a for|tre&s;s which they found impregnable; and in con&s;equence of this, all their advances are in|&s;ecure, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;es are but apparent. The rea&s;onings of Je&s;us &s;tand unan&s;wered; in them Chri&s;tians may re&s;t with the fulle&s;t a&s;&s;ur|ance;
<PB N="371" REF="368">
and in them they find, not only mo|dels for defences of their religion, but al&s;o principles directly applicable to the confutation of many of the objections which have been more lately rai&s;ed again&s;t it.</P>
<P>THE manner which Chri&s;t adopted when he met with oppo&s;ition, gives a new proof of the &s;trength of the evidence which he pro|duced. In convincing many when it was &s;im|ply exhibited, its &s;trength was exerted, and it was di&s;played by the exertion. But prejudice or indi&s;po&s;ition of mind often hinders the &s;tronge&s;t evidence from convincing all. In this ca&s;e, the &s;trength of the evidence can be &s;hown only by rea&s;oning; and by rea&s;oning it may be &s;hown that it ought to have convinced all. The evidence which Chri&s;t offered was examined; and by the examination, its &s;trength was ju&s;tified. That mu&s;t be truth, which has evidence capable of a full vindica|tion by &s;olid argument.</P>
<P>THREE are many who cannot be convinced by the mere exhibition of evidence. The di&s;|tempered need medicine as well as food. Some are either inattentive, or prejudiced, or prone to doubt, or &s;o fond of rea&s;oning as to demand it in every ca&s;e. The&s;e can be convinced only by an argumentative di&s;play of evidence.
<PB N="372" REF="369">
Chri&s;t often met with &s;uch&punc; he adapted his manner to them; he u&s;ed the natural means of bringing them to believe. He did all that could be done for the conviction even of the mo&s;t incredulous. Is not credit due to the teacher who never declined u&s;ing any proper means of conviction? Is it no evidence of truth, that the go&s;pel was capable of being &s;upported by every kind of means?</P>
<P>BUT is there nothing in all this contrary to that &s;implicity which was remarked in his original manner, as a &s;trong indication of his divine character and mi&s;&s;ion? Are there not a&s;&s;ertions of his mi&s;&s;ion and dignity, appeals to the evidences which he had produced, pro|fe&s;&s;ed di&s;plays of them, and threatenings again&s;t tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;ted them? But all the&s;e without exception were occa&s;ioned by oppo&s;i|tion: this gives a full account of them. In this &s;ituation, they had entire propriety; they were even no more than ju&s;tly varied expre&s;|&s;ions of the very characters which &s;hone forth in his original manner.</P>
<P>To hear and an&s;wer objections readily, when men rai&s;ed them; to vindicate the evi|dences of his mi&s;&s;ion by rea&s;oning, when their force was called in que&s;tion, was even nece&s;|&s;ary for &s;howing, that he was &s;incere in claim|ing

<P>OSTENTATION is incon&s;i&s;tent with true dignity: but to illu&s;trate evidence after it has been mi&s;under&s;tood; to enforce it by rea&s;on|ing, on tho&s;e who have not felt its force; to claim whatever is at the &s;ame time proved to be due; is not o&s;tentation: it is truly the natural ea&s;e and conde&s;cen&s;ion, which is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to genuine dignity, that pride finds it nece&s;&s;ary to put it on.

<P>IT may be added, that the nature of all Chri&s;t's rea&s;onings is expre&s;&s;ive both of con|&s;cious truth and of real greatne&s;s. His rea|&s;onings are calculated, always for convincing, never for making a &s;how of ingenuity: they contain nothing either mean, or weak, or ar|tificial: they are all conci&s;e, direct, clear, and cogent. Impo&s;tors affect to di&s;dain an&s;wering objections, or, in&s;tead of &s;olving them by ar|gument, they elude them by mere confident a&s;&s;ertions, by artifice, or by declamation&punc; in ju&s;tifying the evidences of his mi&s;&s;ion, no le&s;s than in originally pre&s;enting them, Chri&s;t is a perfect contra&s;t to impo&s;tors.

<P>THUS, by Chri&s;t's vindication of his mi&s;|&s;ion the features of divinity ob&s;ervable in his original manner, are only thrown into a new attitude. In the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite &s;ituations, he pre&s;erved the character uniform and con&s;i&s;tent&punc; he only varied the expre&s;&s;ions of it, as the ca&s;e required.

Neither Chri&s;t nor his apo&s;tles had an opportunity of attaining it by natural means: they mu&s;t have owed it, therefore, to &s;upernatural cau&s;es; they mu&s;t have been, as they affirmed them|&s;elves to be, per&s;ons commi&s;&s;ioned and in|&s;pired by God.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e &s;trong pre&s;umptions of truth and divinity tend directly to confirm our faith in the go&s;pel. Faith will always ope|rate on the heart and life, in proportion to its &s;trength.

<HEAD>SERMON XVI. THE ADVANTAGES OF THE VIRTUOUS FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF EXTERNAL GOOD.</HEAD>

<Q>A little that a righteous man hath, is better tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the riches of many wicked.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OF the different cour&s;es by which man|kind pur&s;ue happine&s;s, it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged fair to give that the preference, which confers the greate&s;t happine&s;s when all circum&s;tances are &s;uppo&s;ed equal. If it can be proved that the righteous are happier than the wicked in the &s;ame &s;ituation, it will fol|low undeniably that virtue is much more fa|vourable than vice to our intere&s;t in the pre|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nt world; and that, without taking the re|wards of eternity into the account, virtue ought to be the choice of every prudent man. But even this is not all that can be &s;aid with truth in behalf of virtue: my text puts the ca&s;e much &s;tronger; <HI>A little that a righteous</HI>
<PB N="380" REF="376">
<HI>man hath, is better than the riches of many wicked:</HI> a &s;mall portion of the good things of the world, gives the virtuous man more real enjoyment, not than the &s;ame portion, but more than affluence, than riches, nay than the riches of many joined together, can yield to the vicious.</P>
<P>WERE we fully convinced of this, it mu&s;t recommend virtue very &s;trongly, for it would urge us to the practice of it from a regard to our pre&s;ent happine&s;s. In order to convince us of this &s;alatury truth, I &s;hall illu&s;trate and confirm the p&s;almi&s;t's maxim, by &s;hewing,</P>
<P>FIRST, That a good man has <HI>greater</HI> en|joyment from a little, than the wicked can have from the large&s;t fortune; and</P>
<P>SECONDLY, That he has more <HI>durable</HI> en|joyment.</P>
<P>FIRST, A good man has <HI>greater</HI> enjoy|ment, purer and more &s;olid &s;atisfaction, from a little, than the wicked can have from the large&s;t fortune.</P>
<P>IT will &s;carcely be denied by any per&s;on who at all reflects, either that outward po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions can make us happy only &s;o far as we
<PB N="381" REF="377">
enjoy them, or that the foundation of enjoy|ment mu&s;t be laid in our&s;elves. That health of body and freedom from acute pain or &s;evere di&s;temper, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for our de|riving plea&s;ure from the greate&s;t abundance of external things, is acknowledged by all. Why is not the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;ound and healthful temper of mind as univer&s;ally acknowledged? How fooli&s;hly do men e&s;timate the requi&s;ites to happine&s;s! The body is only the in&s;tru|ment, by means of which the &s;oul receives plea&s;ure from outward things: the health of that is confe&s;&s;ed to be nece&s;&s;ary for our enjoy|ing them; with what con&s;i&s;tence can it be de|nied that the health of this is at lea&s;t as nece&s;|&s;ary? It cannot be denied without contradict|ing the plaine&s;t experience. Who is there that cannot recollect the time, when grief for the death of a beloved friend, regret for the lo&s;s of &s;omething valuable, anxiety for what he longed to po&s;&s;e&s;s, or dread of an impending danger, rendered tho&s;e things, not in&s;ipid only, but di&s;agreeable and loath&s;ome, which, in a different &s;tate of mind, would have given him the highe&s;t plea&s;ure? Needs there a clearer evidence, that the immediate and principal foundation of enjoyment lies in the inward temper? If the temper of mind fits us for en|joyment, a little will give us great &s;atisfaction: but if our temper be irregular and unhealthy,
<PB N="382" REF="378">
it will &s;poil our reli&s;h for every object, and render us incapable of extracting any real &s;ati&s;|faction from the greate&s;t affluence.</P>
<P>VICE produces a temper which is very un|favourable to our enjoyment. It de&s;troys the con&s;titution, and breaks the vigour of the &s;oul. It &s;ubjects it to the mo&s;t unea&s;y feelings and the mo&s;t painful pa&s;&s;ions. <HI>The whole head is &s;ick, and the whole heart faint; from the &s;ole of the foot even unto the head, there is no &s;ound|ne&s;s in it, but wounds, and brui&s;es, and pu|trifying &s;ores</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. i. 5, 6.</NOTE>. To a &s;oul in this manner exulcerated and di&s;ea&s;ed, what enjoyment can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;e from the greate&s;t wealth? The perturba|tions with which vice fills the &s;oul, are more incompatible with enjoyment, than any di&s;|temper which can afflict the body. The burn|ing fever does not render us more incapable of ta&s;ting plea&s;ure, than in&s;atiable de&s;ires and boi&s;terous pa&s;&s;ions. Agitated by them, the &s;oul boileth, it to&s;&s;eth, it cannot re&s;t. The agonies of the &s;tone do not more corrode the body, than careful anxiety, fretting peevi&s;h|ne&s;s, pining di&s;content, wa&s;ting envy, fell re|venge, gnawing remor&s;e, and their kindred agonies, the genuine progeny of vice, corrode the mind. The tortures which they inflict,
<PB N="383" REF="379">
force us to nau&s;eate the be&s;t things in life. As the ravenous wolf devours the harmle&s;s lamb, and converts it into its own &s;ub&s;tance, they &s;wallow up all the &s;en&s;ations of the &s;oul, and by the mixture even of &s;uch as are mo&s;t plea&s;ant, become the more excruciating. Ob|jects which might afford the &s;weete&s;t gratifi|cation, they render bitterer than gall. When a man's mind is in the power of every vicious pa&s;&s;ion, all things provoke or deject him, and by heightening his inward mi&s;ery, increa&s;e his incapacity of enjoyment. Is our neighbour fortunate? His pro&s;perity is only fewel thrown into the fire which rages in our &s;ouls. Is he unfortunate? His calamities give us joy; but it is a poi&s;oned joy which &s;wells our hearts into greater naughtine&s;s and malignity. Does the world cen&s;ure us? Con&s;cience is rou&s;ed; it ratifies the cen&s;ure; it &s;tings with redoubled force; we are exa&s;perated into fury; we are rai&s;ed into madne&s;s. Does the world commend us? Our heart tells us that we de&s;erve it not; it can give us no &s;incere plea&s;ure; the feeling of our demerit is &s;trengthened by being contra&s;ted with the opinion of the world; we de&s;pi&s;e our&s;elves and abhor our&s;elves the more. A vicious temper finds occa&s;ion of di&s;quiet and di&s;gu&s;t in every &s;ituation. It deprives a man of that internal &s;erenity and peace which is the &s;ole foundation of happine&s;s. What are <HI>the</HI>
<PB N="384" REF="380">
<HI>riches of many wicked,</HI> what are all the king|doms of the earth able to avail the man who is wretched in him&s;elf? The fierce&s;t &s;hocks of thunder, winds, and rains cannot produce more dreadful convul&s;ions in the frame of na|ture, than tho&s;e into which tumultuous, ex|orbitant, and jarring pa&s;&s;ions throw the &s;oul: they ravage all its enjoyments. Vice lets in upon the &s;oul an inundation of torments, which overwhelms it, as the flood of old overwhelmed the earth, when God <HI>opened the windows of heaven, and broke up the fountains of the great deep,</HI> when <HI>the waters prevailed, and increa&s;ed greatly upon the earth,</HI> and killed <HI>all fle&s;h that moved upon the earth, and de&s;troyed every liv|ing &s;ub&s;tance that was upon the face of the ground</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. vii. 11. 18. 21. 23.</NOTE>. All is chaos and di&s;order; all is uproar and di&s;&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, virtue e&s;tabli&s;hes a tem|per in the &s;oul, which fits us for taking plea|&s;ure in whatever we po&s;&s;e&s;s. It di&s;pells the black clouds which overca&s;t the vicious heart, and intercept the comfort which might ari&s;e from outward things: they are &s;cattered by its brightne&s;s; they fly away before it as the &s;hadows of the night before the ri&s;ing &s;un; they leave the &s;oul open and clear like the &s;erene&s;t
<PB N="385" REF="381">
heavens. Like the &s;overeign voice of God, who&s;e offspring it is, virtue calms tho&s;e in|ward &s;torms which would di&s;turb our peace; it commands the boi&s;terous winds which tear the wicked brea&s;t, to cea&s;e; it quells the com|motion which &s;in had rai&s;ed, and made to overflow the wicked like a wide breaking in of waters, and to de&s;ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">te all their plea&s;ures. As righteous Noah found refuge in the ark from all the &s;pouting cataracts of heaven, and all the gu&s;hing fountains of the deep, &s;o the good man, in the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rentiy which his virtue has e&s;tabli&s;hed, finds &s;ecurity again&s;t the inunda|tion of pains by which the enjoyments of the &s;inner are &s;wept away. By directing all our pa&s;&s;ions to their proper objects, and by mode|rating their impetuo&s;ity, virtue &s;trikes at the root of every corrupt lu&s;t, and every pertur|bation fatal to our enjoyment. So far as it prevails, it cures the &s;oul of di&s;&s;atisfaction and di&s;ea&s;e. No importunate appetite, no vexa|tious pa&s;&s;ion, no &s;ickening remor&s;e, no &s;hud|dering dread, no terrifying forebodings of fu|ture mi&s;ery wound the peace of the righteous, or render his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions un&s;atisfying. Virtue cheri&s;hes the mo&s;t plea&s;ant affections, content|ment, love, chearfulne&s;s, joy, hope; and by their influence it &s;weetens the ordinary com|forts of human life, and keeps the &s;oul in a proper habit for turning all things to the be&s;t
<PB N="386" REF="382">
advantage. It produces a natural and regular motion of all our powers. Above all, it pro|motes the active operation of kind and devout affections, which give a &s;oundne&s;s and vigour to the mind, more favourable than the greate&s;t flow of bodily health, to an exqui&s;ite reli&s;h of life and its mo&s;t common ble&s;&s;ings. A tem|per &s;o delightful as that which virtue e&s;ta|bli&s;hes, has power enough to overcome the bitterne&s;s of &s;orrow: much abler mu&s;t it be to improve all our &s;ources of enjoyment, and heighten all the plea&s;ures which naturally i&s;&s;ue from them. The temper of the good man fits him for enjoying all the happine&s;s of others, and for ta&s;ting &s;atisfaction from the compa&s;&s;ion with which he regards their pains. If the world approves him, he has its approbation without abatement; it is confirmed by his own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of worth: and the joy which attends this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, cannot be extin|gui&s;hed by the cen&s;ure of the ignorant and the malicious; in exerting it&s;elf to ri&s;e above that cen&s;ure, it is often brightened and rendered the more exhilarating. A virtuous temper lays the mind open to every &s;atisfaction that comes in its way, prepares it for embracing and en|joying it; and it renders the man &s;o well di&s;|po&s;ed, &s;o happy in him&s;elf, that almo&s;t every object throws &s;ome &s;atisfaction in his way.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="383">THUS the temper of the mind is the very foundation of enjoyment: vice &s;poils this tem|per; virtue alone can pre&s;erve it &s;ound. In the &s;ame outward circum&s;tances, therefore, it is plain that the enjoyment of the good man will be far &s;uperior. But very little reflection is nece&s;&s;ary to convince us that from the &s;ame principles it follows undeniably, that even in the mo&s;t unequal circum&s;tances, even when the wicked are &s;uppo&s;ed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ave the greate&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters">uence, and the righteous to po&s;&s;e&s;s but a little, the latter have much g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">ment than the form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r.</P>
<P>WE are very a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t to confound tho&s;e external things which are only the materials of enjoy|ment, with enjoyment it&s;elf. They are how|ever totally di&s;tinct. Every day's experience proves that a man may have many external things in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, from which he derives no real enjoyment. Every per&s;on is forced to make this ob&s;ervation on &s;ome occa&s;ions. In the pre&s;ent argument, it is of great importance to attend to the di&s;tinction. Riches are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters">|able only &s;o far as they yield enjoym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nt. They can therefore be of little value to the wicked man, who&s;e temper renders him &s;o incapable of enjoying them. His &s;oul is di&s;ea&s;ed: though he had alone the riches of many wealthy men, they could give him little &s;incere delight. They
<PB N="388" REF="384">
may purcha&s;e objects the fitte&s;t for gratifying the &s;en&s;es: but by the&s;e, his &s;en&s;es are not gratified. They may procure for him all the elegances of life: but his inward habit &s;ophi&s;ti|cates the plea&s;ure which they ought to give him. How different is the condition of the good man? He may po&s;&s;e&s;s very little; but his inward temper &s;ecures to him the full en|joyment of whatever he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth. A very little is &s;ufficient for the nece&s;&s;aries of life; and if he have only the nece&s;&s;aries of life, he can derive from them, more &s;olid plea&s;ure, even of &s;en&s;e, than the wicked derive from all their riches. In reality there is not &s;o great a difference as there &s;eems to be, between the homely plea&s;ure of the poore&s;t cottager and the &s;plendid luxury of the greate&s;t monarch. There is generally more chearfulne&s;s and contentment in the cottage than in the palace. This is, at the very lowe&s;t, a demon&s;tration that the poor have more real &s;atisfaction and enjoyment, than the rich can ea&s;ily believe to be compatible with their &s;ituation. Neverthele&s;s a few ob|vious remarks may enable the rich to form a conception of it. It is confe&s;&s;ed that by con|tinual u&s;e, the mo&s;t &s;umptuous enjoyments lo&s;e their reli&s;h: they become common and familiar; they are in time de&s;pi&s;ed by tho&s;e who had at fir&s;t the quicke&s;t ta&s;te of them. Cu&s;tom brings down the enjoyment of the
<PB N="389" REF="385">
prince almo&s;t to a level with that of the pea|&s;ant. The rich find their accu&s;tomed plea|&s;ures &s;o in&s;ipid, that they are continually &s;earch|ing for new delights: but the poor remain contented with the &s;ame &s;imple fare, and, with|out a wi&s;h for variety, repeat it day after day with undimini&s;hed reli&s;h; an evidence, that the &s;imple&s;t things give the mo&s;t real and la&s;t|ing plea&s;ure. It is felt by the luxurious them|&s;elves. Amid&s;t all the variations of enter|tainment which they introduce, they never ba|ni&s;h from their tables bread and water, the nece&s;&s;aries of life, the con&s;tant viands of the poor. In the&s;e plain productions of nature, they find &s;olider &s;atisfaction than in all the refined inventions of the epicure. When at &s;ome times, whetted with hunger, and unable to procure their ordinary delicacies, they have been obliged to take up with homely fare, it gave them a higher gratification than they found at other times in all their dainties. By acknowledging that it did, they unintentionally give their &s;uffrage for the reality of the poor man's enjoyment. You will &s;ay, It was ow|ing only to the accidental keenne&s;s of their ap|petite. Granted. But this confirms our ar|gument. They commonly prevent their ap|petites; and by doing &s;o, they nece&s;&s;arily pre|vent their plea&s;ure, which ari&s;es chiefly from &s;atisfying appetite. The poor man has al|ways
<PB N="390" REF="386">
this advantage: he runs not before his appetites; he eats and drinks, only to &s;atisfy them; and from their being &s;atisfied he de|rives that enjoyment every day, which is &s;o unu&s;ual to the luxurious. His &s;en&s;es being neither palled nor vitiated, he u&s;es the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ar&s;e&s;t food with more exqui&s;ite reli&s;h, than the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|pered, debauch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d palate of the voluptuous can admit. But if the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">al plea&s;ures of the poor and the rich be in them&s;elves &s;o nearly upon a level, the poor man who, by being virtuous, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es inward tranquillity, mu&s;t have great advantage for enjoyment, above a rich man who is wicked and &s;elf-tormented. The plea|&s;ure of the former is pure; all the plea&s;ures of the latter are wofully &s;ophi&s;ticated. <HI>Better is a dry mor&s;el, and quietne&s;s of &s;pirit therewith, than a hou&s;e full of &s;acrifices with</HI> the inward <HI>trouble</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvii. 1. xv. 16.</NOTE> which vice produces. If the righteous man have only the nece&s;&s;aries of life, they are better than all the trea&s;ures of the wicked. But there are very few who have not more than the nece&s;&s;aries of life.

<P>INSATIABLE de&s;ires, in common with every irregular and faulty pa&s;&s;ion, ob&s;truct our en|joyment of outward things by &s;poiling the in|ward temper: they likewi&s;e ob&s;truct in it a way peculiar to them&s;elves. It is not the le&s;s true for being trite, That our natural wants are few and ea&s;ily &s;upplied, but that no abun|dance can &s;upply the extravagance and mul|titude of artificial wants which ari&s;e in the ungoverned mind. <HI>He that loveth &s;ilver, &s;hall not be &s;atisfied with &s;ilver,</HI> let him have ever &s;o much, <HI>nor he that loveth abundance, with increa&s;e</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. v. 10.</NOTE>, be it ever &s;o great. <HI>In the fulne&s;s of his &s;ufficiency he &s;hall be in &s;traits</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job. xx. 22.</NOTE>.

his de&s;ire gathers &s;trength proportioned to their fancied value: and the con&s;tant habit of indulging it rai&s;es it to a degree of vehemence far exceeding even his own opinion of the value of its objects.

Exorbitant de&s;ire is a drop&s;y of the &s;oul: it parches it with a thir&s;t which, far from being allayed, is inflamed by every draught; it cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;atisfied; the more &s;tudiou&s;ly it is indulged, the more im|portunately it cries, Give, give. Incapable of gratification from its own objects, it like|wi&s;e renders a man unfit for deriving gratifi|cation from other objects.

The greater the abundance which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, the more frequent the gratifications which his &s;ituation affords to his de&s;ires, the more incapable he is of real enjoyment. A pitiable, wretched &s;tate! But a &s;tate into which the want of &s;elf-government nece&s;&s;arily plunges men! You may every day ob&s;erve it realized in the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the rich and the voluptuous, perpetually running from place to place, and from entertainment to entertain|ment; weary of the pre&s;ent; impatient for the future; but &s;ick of it al&s;o, the moment they have begun to ta&s;te it.

As in a healthful body the nouri&s;hment di&s;tributed regularly to all the members, renders the whole well-proportioned, vigorous, and agile; &s;o in the virtuous &s;oul, the proper gratification be|ing allowed to every natural pa&s;&s;ion, it contri|butes its part to enjoyment and happine&s;s.</P>

You readily think of avarice: it forbids the application of riches to any of the nece&s;&s;ary ends of life; it pro&s;cribes every po&s;&s;ible u&s;e of wealth; the more a covetous man has, the more anxious his trouble in pre&s;erving it, the more excru|ciating his dread of lo&s;ing it, the more parch|ing and unquenchable his thir&s;t for greater riches.

Intem|perance! it is the very organ of &s;en&s;ual plea|&s;ure; plea&s;ure is its direct aim and end; if any of the vices can improve our enjoyment of outward things, it mu&s;t be intemperance.

That it gives him likewi&s;e more durable enjoyment, &s;hall be proved hereafter. Without virtue, what is life? A dreary wa&s;te, a barren de&s;ert. What is all that the world can be&s;tow, but vanity, pain, and bitterne&s;s? But to the virtuous, poverty is wealth. Where virtue is not, di&s;&s;atisfaction and wretch|edne&s;s prevail. Where virtue dwells, there is &s;incere plea&s;ure and true enjoyment. Behold the bla&s;ting, poi&s;onous influence of vice: let your regard to intere&s;t, to pre&s;ent intere&s;t, urge you to abandon it.

<P>THE practice of virtue pre&s;erves and im|proves the capacity of enjoyment; the practice of wickedne&s;s impairs it. As every vice tends to unfit us for the true enjoyment of outward things, the greater and the more numerous our vices are, our enjoyment mu&s;t be the le&s;s. They may become &s;o many and &s;o great as to render the ample&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions perfectly in&s;ipid. In wicked men, vicious habits never fail to

As bodily di&s;temper, from &s;mall beginnings, increa&s;es till it prove mortal, as one di&s;ea&s;e neglected is the cau&s;e of many others; &s;o the vices of the depraved heart daily acquire new &s;trength by indul|gence; they propagate many more; they in|fect the temper and di&s;order the con&s;titution with a growing multitude of tormenting pa&s;|&s;ions; they root guilt, remor&s;e, and terror deeper in the &s;oul. When the government of the pa&s;&s;ions is neglected, when the authority of con&s;cience is &s;lighted, when a &s;acred regard to the will of God is ca&s;t away, every tempta|tion will precipitate a man into new &s;ins, and every new &s;in will be the &s;ource of many griefs. However weak, however few his &s;in|ful habits be at fir&s;t, however little they di&s;|turb his enjoyment, they will increa&s;e, and in the end de&s;troy it. Whatever good quali|ties he once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, they will be gradually choaked by his &s;preading vices; they will wither and decay; his capacity of enjoyment will be bla&s;ted in the &s;ame proportion. The man who never thinks of rectifying the de|pravities of his temper, but goes on to indulge them without controul, mu&s;t at la&s;t become abandoned, and in&s;u&s;ceptible of genuine &s;ati&s;|faction.

<P>THE health of the body, as well as the temper of the mind, is requi&s;ite for our find|ing plea&s;ure in outward things.

<P>IT is not only by pre&s;erving the capacity of enjoyment that virtue prolongs our &s;atisfac|tion; it is not only by impairing this capacity that vice ha&s;tens its extinction: virtue likewi&s;e gives a greater probability than vice, for the continuance of tho&s;e outward things which are the materials and means of enjoyment.

<P>ON the one hand, That good men have not in fact all the enjoyment which virtue natu|rally tends to produce, is owing wholly to vice, and to the infirmities which vice has brought upon their &s;ouls. From vice &s;till lurking in their hearts, it proceeds that the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t men are &s;ometimes p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">yed upon by tho&s;e painful pa&s;&s;ions which eat out the &s;weetne&s;s of the mo&s;t pro&s;perous condition. From vice imperfectly &s;ubdued, it proceeds that their de|&s;ires
<PB N="418" REF="413">
are at times immoderate, and plunge them into di&s;&s;atisfaction amid&s;t real abundance. From the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of vice which they have com|mitted, and of which they are not certain that they have yet obtained forgivene&s;s, it proceeds that their enjoyment is &s;ometimes overca&s;t by remor&s;e, and doubt, and fear. If they ta&s;te not all the joys of beneficence, it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the imperfection of their kind af|fections, or to vicious pa&s;&s;ions which counter|act their exerci&s;e, preventing their doing all the good that they have it in their power to do. If they do not con&s;tantly delight them|&s;elves in the God of their mercies, it is becau&s;e the weakne&s;s of their piety or the influence of &s;en&s;ible things hinders them from pre&s;erving a continual &s;en&s;e of him as the giver of all good. If they wa&s;te their means of enjoyment by frivolous expence or injudicious &s;how, or even profu&s;e liberality, it is owing to &s;ome weak|ne&s;s or imprudence which, though compatible with a character virtuous upon the whole, is not totally innocent. If they &s;ink under the lo&s;s of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the cau&s;e will be found in &s;ome remaining undue attachment to the comforts of ea&s;y circum&s;tances, or to &s;uppo&s;ed rank in life, which completer virtue would teach them to de&s;pi&s;e, and to &s;acrifice without a &s;igh to the will of God. In every ca&s;e, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">njoyment of the virtuous falls &s;hort of what
<PB N="419" REF="414">
we have de&s;cribed, only becau&s;e their virtues are imperfect, and not altogether refined from the alloy of vice. Being occa&s;ioned by this, its falling &s;hort is &s;o far from being an objec|tion again&s;t the tendency of virtue to &s;ecure to us the full enjoyment of outward things, that it turns out to be a new and irrefragable demon&s;tration of the malignant nature of vice. Its influence is &s;o &s;ubtle and &s;o pernicious, that a &s;mall mixture of it &s;ophi&s;ticates the joys of the mo&s;t exalted virtue.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, To what is it owing, that the wicked have any enjoyment in all that they po&s;&s;e&s;s? Not to their wickedne&s;s: its real tendency is preci&s;ely &s;uch as has been de|&s;cribed: but to this, that the very wor&s;t of men have &s;ome good qualities, &s;ome imperfect degrees of virtue. By pre&s;erving &s;ome mea&s;ure of health and &s;oundne&s;s in their &s;ouls, the&s;e give them &s;ome capacity of enjoyment. The&s;e &s;et &s;ome bounds to their appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, and prevent their de&s;ires from becoming ab&s;o|lutely in&s;atiable. From reflection upon the&s;e, they derive &s;ome kind of &s;elf-approbation and hearts-ea&s;e. Their partial goodne&s;s dilutes the poi&s;on of their many vices; it produces both mitigation and intermi&s;&s;ion of their wretched|ne&s;s; but it cannot prevent their being often inwardly tormented when the world perceives
<PB N="420" REF="415">
it not; it cannot prevent their plea&s;ures from being &s;ecretly tainted with the bitterne&s;s of corrupt affections and remor&s;e. That they are capable of reli&s;hing even the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, they owe to their virtues; that their plea&s;ures are any-wi&s;e impaired, they owe wholly to their vices. Their virtues, &s;lender as they are, gain them admi&s;&s;ion likewi&s;e to nobler plea|&s;ures. Very few are &s;o depraved, as to exer|ci&s;e no compa&s;&s;ion, humanity, or benevolence. Many who cannot be reckoned truly virtuous, perform acts of genero&s;ity or mercy, from which they derive great &s;atisfaction. They cloath their very luxury and profu&s;ion with the garb of &s;ocial virtue, and in this di&s;gui&s;e re|gard them with complacence. Kind affections are &s;o highly beatifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, that, even when they are much deba&s;ed, they diffu&s;e &s;erenity upon the &s;oul. But their being deba&s;ed renders it impo&s;&s;ible that the plea&s;ure communicated by them to the wicked, who exerci&s;e them but in|&s;tinctively and ca&s;ually, can ever ri&s;e to an equality with the pure and con&s;tant joy of which the uniform exertion of them, from principle, from con&s;cience, from love of good|ne&s;s, is productive to the &s;incerely virtuous. In the wicked, the&s;e amiable affections, being imperfectly formed, and mixed with other di&s;|po&s;itions odious and di&s;gu&s;ting in their nature, his character is heterogeneous and mon&s;trous,

unfit for yielding him, upon reflection, that full &s;atisfaction and delight, by which the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of con&s;i&s;tent and growing virtue at|tunes the good man's &s;oul to every plea&s;ing &s;entiment. Whatever enjoyment, then, the wicked actually have, it proves not that vice can ever become conducive to enjoyment; it proves only the power of virtue to be &s;o great, that the lowe&s;t degree, the incomplete&s;t kind of it, can in &s;ome mea&s;ure counteract the ten|dency of vice to plunge the corrupt and the guilty into perfect mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>THUS, in every light in which it can be viewed, the P&s;ami&s;t's maxim, <HI>A little that a righteous man hath, is better than the riches of many wicked,</HI> however paradoxical it may &s;eem at fir&s;t hearing, approves it&s;elf as a prin|ciple of mo&s;t unque&s;tionable certainty.

The good man's reli&s;h for enjoyment improves continually; the &s;inner's is &s;peedily impaired: the conduct of the former is conducive to the pre&s;ervation of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; the conduct of the latter in many ways endangers the lo&s;s of them: in behalf of the former, the divine Providence is engaged&punc; but <HI>the face of the Lord</HI>

<HEAD>SERMON XVIII. THE POWER OF VIRTUOUS RESOLUTIONS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM cxix. 106.</BIBL>
<Q>I have &s;worn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SOLEMN re&s;olutions and vows have al|ways been con&s;idered as powerful means of enabling men to ab&s;tain from vice and to practi&s;e virtue. Philo&s;ophers, as well as di|vines, have acknowledged their influence, and recommended it to their di&s;ciples, to form them with care. Fal&s;e religions, as well as the true religion, enjoin them, in order to de|termine their votaries to &s;teadine&s;s in tho&s;e practices which they inculcate upon them.</P>
<P>IN common life, experience &s;hews that an explicit, determined re&s;olution has often very great power. In religion, experience &s;eems rather to proclaim that the be&s;t re&s;olutions are generally weak and ineffectual: the one hour
<PB N="428" REF="423">
men re&s;olve to practi&s;e holine&s;s; and the next hour they for&s;ake it, as if they had never in|tended to practi&s;e it. We cannot, however, fairly conclude from this incon&s;tancy, that it is of no avail to form virtuous re&s;olutions. In whatever degree the frailty of human nature and the temptations of the world may render them in fact abortive; it is evident from their natural tendency, that they are among the be&s;t means of reformation from &s;in, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d of confirmation and improvement in holine&s;s. The text will naturally lead us to unfold their tendency, and to evince their power. <HI>I have &s;worn,</HI> &s;ays David, <HI>and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.</HI> He had already agreed to keep them; he had &s;trengthened his re&s;olution by interpo&s;ing an oath, a &s;olemn vow: he would not have formed it with &s;o great care and &s;olemnity if he had not been convinced that it would con|tribute much to regulate his conduct; and the manner of his reflecting upon it &s;hows a deep &s;en&s;e of the obligation which it laid him under to fulfil. In this di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall ex|amine the nature of that influence which vir|tuous re&s;olutions have in fixing our temper and regulating our practice; and afterwards deduce &s;ome practical improvement from the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>WHAT then is the nature of that influence and power which may ju&s;tly be a&s;cribed to virtuous
<PB N="429" REF="424">
re&s;olutions? Mi&s;take concerning it, is one of the principal cau&s;es of the inefficacy of &s;uch re|&s;olutions. We expect from them, effects which they cannot po&s;&s;ibly produce; and therefore mi&s;s the fruits which might be reaped from the due improvement of them. A re&s;olution, even the firme&s;t and the &s;tronge&s;t, cannot directly or immediately extirpate vice and implant holine&s;s. It is an internal act of goodne&s;s; the repetition of it will form a cor|re&s;pondent habit; but the only habit corre|&s;pondent to it, is the habit of re&s;olving well. Virtuous re&s;olutions, frequently renewed with &s;incerity, will accu&s;tom us to renew them with le&s;s reluctance, with greater ea&s;e and readine&s;s. But they cannot, by their imme|diate operation, without other means, clean&s;e the heart in an in&s;tant f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">om vicious habits and &s;in|ful inclinations, or rear a virtuous temper. A re&s;olution, however &s;ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mn, is only a deter|mination of the will. But God has not put our di&s;po&s;itions and our habits &s;o ab&s;olutely in our power, that we can form or de&s;troy them by merely willing it. To become pure and virtuous is a far more arduous ta&s;k. God has appointed it to be our exerci&s;e&punc; our work, our labour throughout this &s;tate of trial. He has ordained that it &s;hould not be accompli&s;hed without con&s;tant exertion, diligence, and care. His grace could doubtle&s;s transform the &s;oul,
<PB N="430" REF="425">
in a moment, from wickedne&s;s to perfect purity: but he has adapted the e&s;tabli&s;hed me|thods of his grace to the principles of the hu|man con&s;titution; enabling even tho&s;e to whom it is mo&s;t liberally communicated, to mortify their depraved affections and to acquire the virtues of the Chri&s;tian temper, only by &s;low advances and imperceptible &s;teps, in con|&s;equence of continual circum&s;pection, unre|mitted activity in well-doing, and frequent and fervent prayer. As in the natural world, the plant is rai&s;ed to maturity only by a regu|lar proce&s;s of vegetation, in con&s;equence of &s;kilful culture and the nouri&s;hing dews of heaven; &s;o in the &s;piritual world, the &s;eeds of virtue can be ripened into a &s;olid temper only by a continued cour&s;e of virtuous practice, animated by the power of divine grace. It is by exciting us to &s;uch practice, by prompting us to a &s;eries of good actions, that re&s;olutions contribute to our improvement: and becau&s;e they excite and prompt us in many ways, they are powerful in&s;truments of our improve|ment.</P>
<P>1. A RESOLUTION of virtue lays us un|der an <HI>obligation</HI> to be virtuous. In the lan|guage of &s;cripture, it <HI>binds the &s;oul with a bond</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Num, xxx. 2.</NOTE>. A re&s;olution to do any thing, though
<PB N="431" REF="426">
formed with perfect &s;ecre&s;y, produces an obli|gation to do it, without fulfilling which we cannot thoroughly approve our&s;elves. If we have ra&s;hly re&s;olved to do what it is not fit to do, we are di&s;&s;atisfied with our imprudence in re&s;olving: if what we re&s;olved upon was pro|per and worthy, to depart from it forces us to de&s;pi&s;e our&s;elves for our ficklene&s;s and incon|&s;tancy; and pierces us with a mortifying con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that our weakne&s;s renders us contemptible in the eyes of the world. If you know a per&s;on who&s;e character in common life is, that he &s;eldom under&s;tands his own mind, that he alters his intention almo&s;t every hour, that he never keeps one purpo&s;e &s;o long as to have time to execute it, that he re|&s;olves and promi&s;es, but quickly changes &s;ides; that he cannot be depended upon in any bu&s;i|ne&s;s of moment; you know likewi&s;e that it is far from an e&s;timable character, that it is univer&s;ally de&s;picable, that it is incompatible with every degree of a manly &s;pirit. To carry this wavering and un&s;teadine&s;s into religion, is far more cen&s;urable. The importance of reli|gion and the ba&s;ene&s;s of living in the violation of its laws, prevent the breach of religious re|&s;olution from being regarded as a contemptible imbecility; they render it a dete&s;table crime. To <HI>depart from evil, and do good</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxxiv. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>, is the
<PB N="432" REF="427">
proper bu&s;ine&s;s of man. To re&s;olve upon it, is our highe&s;t wi&s;dom; it is nece&s;&s;ary to our pre&s;ent peace and to our future happine&s;s. In proportion to its importance, is the ba&s;ene&s;s and the ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ominy of incon&s;tancy in pur&s;uing this cour&s;e after we have re&s;olved upon it. Having decreed the only path of life, having determined to walk in it, can any levity be &s;o degrading, can any irre&s;olution be &s;o di&s;|graceful, as to be allured by trifling plea&s;ures or advantages, or prevailed upon by momen|tary pains, to de&s;ert this path, and to per&s;i&s;t in wandering from it, though we meet di&s;qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t and di&s;appointment at every &s;tep, and know that without a &s;peedy return, the end mu&s;t be everla&s;ting death? <HI>After vows</HI> of &s;uch high importance, of &s;o intere&s;ting tendency, <HI>it is a &s;nare,</HI> it is full of danger <HI>to make enquiry</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xx. 25.</NOTE>, once to admit the thought of retracting them. Can you know your&s;elves guilty of it, with|out confu&s;ion and &s;elf-abhorrence? Can you be guilty of it, and not feel your&s;elves ju&s;tly abominable in the &s;ight of God? <HI>When thou vowe&s;t a vow unto God, defer not to pay it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or he hath no plea&s;ure in fools</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. v. 4.</NOTE>. By thus laying us under an obligation, the violation of which mu&s;t produce a mortifying &s;en&s;e of ba&s;ene&s;s and demerit, virtuous re&s;olutions cannot fail to promote &s;teady per&s;everance in virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="428">A VIRTUOUS re&s;olution impels us to vir|tue, by rendering it an <HI>object</HI> and <HI>aim</HI> to us. Let a pur&s;uit be no wi&s;e intere&s;ting in it&s;elf, yet when we have determined to engage in it, we are no longer indifferent: this very deter|mination is &s;ufficient to impre&s;s it upon us as an end which we mu&s;t now attain. Religion is &s;upremely intere&s;ting to every human crea|ture, though he &s;hould never re&s;olve to prac|ti&s;e it. But giddine&s;s or the avocations of worldly care hinder many from thinking of it as their concern, as a bu&s;ine&s;s with which they ought to charge them&s;elves. Inattention to our concern in the practice of religion, is the mo&s;t general cau&s;e of the neglect of it. Again&s;t that inattention, the mo&s;t direct and efficacious antidote is a &s;erious, deliberate, firm re&s;olution that religion &s;hall be the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of our lives. This &s;ets it in our eye, as what mu&s;t be practi&s;ed, as what mu&s;t not be on any account neglected, as the center in which all our thoughts, and views, and exer|tions mu&s;t ultimately terminate: this gives the whole &s;oul a prevailing and habitual bias to it, and predi&s;po&s;es us to re&s;i&s;t every temp|tation to vice, and to embrace every opportu|nity for virtue. Of the&s;e native con&s;equences of a fixt determination, David gives many bright delineations from his own experience. <HI>I have &s;worn that I will keep thy righteous judg|ments:</HI>
<PB N="434" REF="429">
therefore <HI>I will perform it: my &s;oul is continually in my hand, yet do I not forget thy law; the wicked have laid a &s;nare for me, yet I erred not from thy precepts: thy te&s;timonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: I have inclined mine heart to perform thy &s;tatutes al|way, even unto the end</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. cxix. 109, 110, 111, 112.</NOTE>. <HI>I have cho&s;en the way of truth:</HI> What was the effect? <HI>Thy judg|ments have I laid before me,</HI> as the model of my whole conduct; <HI>I have &s;tuck unto thy te&s;|timonies; I will run the way of thy command|ments</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 30, 31, 32&punc;</NOTE>. Such are the genuine &s;entiments and workings of a &s;oul under the power of a &s;trong purpo&s;e of univer&s;al holine&s;s. It is natural for tho&s;e who have never re&s;olved on virtuous practice, to waver between good and evil. But a firm re&s;olution fixes the will in the choice of good; and as long as it is thus fixt, how can our actions, which are the immediate effects of the exertion of the will, be evil? Till the re&s;olution is decayed or forgotten, we cannot give full con&s;ent to any vice: it will be not only a con&s;tant monitor of our obliga|tion to adhere &s;teadfa&s;tly to virtue, but likewi&s;e a con&s;tant incitement to fulfil the obligation, and a counterpoi&s;e to the power of &s;in. Temp|tations &s;olicit in the &s;ame manner as formerly; depraved appetites and pa&s;&s;ions crave their
<PB N="435" REF="430">
wonted indulgence: but they find a &s;trong re|&s;i&s;tance to their impul&s;e; they find the will determined on the contrary cour&s;e; they find the &s;oul bent to per&s;everance in it: before they can prevail, they mu&s;t conquer this re|&s;i&s;tance; and before they can conquer it, re&s;o|lution mu&s;t have lo&s;t its force. The man who remains deeply impre&s;&s;ed with his re&s;olution to obey all God's laws, whenever he feels him&s;elf in danger of a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, readily checks him&s;elf by recollecting, that it is in|con&s;i&s;tent with the conduct which he has re|&s;olved to pur&s;ue. To every effort of irregular inclination, he can oppo&s;e the firm determina|tion of the will; to every temptation to &s;in, he is prepared to an&s;wer, I am re&s;olved again&s;t it. Can it fail to be a great advantage, to have the heart thus &s;teadily turned to virtue, and &s;et upon the practice of it? I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;olutions regarding common life, the advantage is uni|ver&s;ally acknowledged and experienced. We &s;cruple not to di&s;&s;uade a man from many things which he <HI>de&s;igns;</HI> but when we know that he is ab&s;olutely <HI>determined</HI> on any point, we confe&s;s it to be in vain to endeavour to di&s;|&s;uade him. And why &s;hould not re&s;olutions in religion have equal influence? Only be|cau&s;e we are not careful to render them equally firm.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="431">FROM the habitual bent to virtue, as its object and its aim, which an explicit re&s;olu|tion of pur&s;uing it impre&s;&s;es on the &s;oul, there ari&s;es another great advantage. If it were po&s;|&s;ible that a man &s;hould employ him&s;elf in vir|tuous actions without any previous re&s;olution of being virtuous, yet the&s;e actions could im|prove only the particular virtue of which they were immediate exertions. Acts of ab&s;tinence would improve the habit of temperance, but could add no &s;trength to the habits of ju&s;tice, benevolence, and piety: acts of ju&s;tice or of charity would promote a ju&s;t or charitable &s;pirit, but could contribute nothing towards forming the other parts of a holy temper. His progre&s;s would re&s;emble the imperfect opera|tions of human art, in which only one mem|ber of the work is &s;haped or poli&s;hed at once, the other members remaining, in the mean time, rude and without form: while he were intent&punc; on improving one of the virtues of a good character, he could make no improve|ment in any of the other virtues. But when a firm re&s;olution has devoted us to the practice of univer&s;al holine&s;s, it gives the &s;oul a fixt bias and permanent propen&s;ity to every part of holine&s;s: we apply our&s;elves to every duty which there is an opportunity of performing, as a branch of the general plan which we have determined to execute; and in con&s;equence of
<PB N="437" REF="432">
this, by performing it, we carry forward that whole plan. Every good action undertaken in accompli&s;hment of a re&s;olution of univer&s;al holine&s;s, whatever be the particular nature of that action, &s;trengthens the re&s;olution, con|firms the general bias re&s;ulting from it, and by doing &s;o, renders us better di&s;po&s;ed, not only to the virtue from which it directly pro|ceeds, but to all the virtues which come within the compa&s;s of our re&s;olution. We advance in the improvement of our hearts, in a manner &s;imilar to the perfect operation of God, who in every one of his works forms the rudiments of all the parts at once, and by one proce&s;s extending its influence to them all, rears them together to perfection: firmly re|&s;olved to do whatever we know to be our duty, we acquire the beginnings of all the vir|tues at once; by every good action of our lives, we rai&s;e them all to a greater degree of vigour; we are &s;ecure again&s;t the danger of re&s;ting &s;a|tisfied with partial goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>THUS, a re&s;olution of holine&s;s &s;incerely formed and carefully pre&s;erved, has great power to render us holy, by fixing holine&s;s as an end which we mu&s;t pur&s;ue, by pre&s;enting it to our view as our proper bu&s;ine&s;s, by pre|di&s;po&s;ing the mind alike to all the parts of it,
<PB N="438" REF="433">
and by rendering the exertions of every virtue the means of cultivating univer&s;al goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>3. A VIRTUOUS re&s;olution contributes to our practi&s;ing virtue, by rendering the practice of it <HI>agreeable</HI> to us. This is the natural con&s;equence of that habitual bias which re&s;o|lution impre&s;&s;es on the &s;oul. Many things, no-wi&s;e painful in them&s;elves, become di&s;a|greeable to us merely becau&s;e we undertake them with reluctance, becau&s;e they run coun|ter to our pre&s;ent bent and inclination. The very &s;ame things will be accompli&s;hed with ea&s;e, and even pro&s;ecuted with plea&s;ure at an|other time, when they are undertaken of choice, and coincide with inclination. A re|&s;olution renders that our choice which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for fulfilling it, removes our back|wardne&s;s to engage in it, prevents the unea&s;i|ne&s;s which this backwardne&s;s would occa&s;ion in performing it, and makes it to fall in with the prevailing propen&s;ity of the &s;oul. In common life a thou&s;and things appear im|practicable when we fir&s;t think of them, which neverthele&s;s we execute with facility as &s;oon as a firm re&s;olution has &s;et our hearts upon them. A determined mind can &s;upport the harde&s;t labour and &s;urmount the greate&s;t difficulties with alacrity and &s;atisfaction. Ir|regular inclinations and corrupt affections ren|der
<PB N="439" REF="434">
us aver&s;e to the re&s;traints which religion impo&s;es on them: we engage in it with re|luctance; and therefore every &s;tep is difficult and unplea&s;ant. A hearty re&s;olution, if it cannot de&s;troy our reluctance, provides a coun|terbalance to it: it determines our fixt choice to holine&s;s; it makes us habitually &s;olicitous to become holy; it renders us intent on prac|ti&s;ing it: we enter into it wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">h &s;pirit; we ex|ert our&s;elves with vigour; and we feel plea|&s;ure in the exertion.

<P>4. A VIRTUOUS re&s;olution has great in|fluence on our improvement, by putting us on the diligent u&s;e of all the <HI>means</HI> nece&s;&s;ary for fulfilling the re&s;olution. We &s;hould reckon it labour lo&s;t, to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tow a thought on the means of acquiring what we have no intention to pur&s;ue. It may be very valuable: but w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> have never propo&s;ed it to our&s;elves as an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nd; to what purpo&s;e then enquire, how it may be attained? But as &s;oon as we have determined on the end, our thought is naturally turned to the proper means of promoting it. The end is &s;o intimately connected with the means &s;ub&s;ervient to it, that, while that continues in our view, no effort is &s;trong enough to pre|vent all attention to the&s;e: it renders us eagerly inqui&s;itive about them; it &s;ugge&s;ts them to our notice; it forces us to dwell upon them; it makes us forward to apply them; and pre&s;erves us active and indefatigable in the application of them. Such being the acknowledged tendency of a fixt re&s;olution,
<PB N="441" REF="436">
the re&s;olution of virtue cannot fail to direct our &s;olicitous concern to the means of becom|ing virtuous: <HI>wherewith &s;hall a young man clean&s;e his way</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> cxix. 9.</NOTE>? is the que&s;tion which it impelled David to propo&s;e with earne&s;tne&s;s; and it will lead every man who has formed it with equal &s;incerity, often to propo&s;e the &s;ame que&s;tion to him&s;elf with the like earne&s;t|ne&s;s, and to enforce his attention to it with the greate&s;t care. The means of holine&s;s, it is not difficult to di&s;cover; they are clearly revealed to us: careful &s;tudy of the divine law, fervent prayer for the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, circum&s;pect vigilance again&s;t evil, unwearied diligence in every good action which opportu|nity permits; the&s;e are the direct and immediate in&s;truments of virtuous improvement. That a virtuous re&s;olution in&s;tigates to the u&s;e of the&s;e, almo&s;t every man may be convinced from his own experience; for there is &s;carcely any man who has never formed one good re&s;o|lution. Recollect then: for &s;ome little time after you had formed it, did you not feel &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition to attend to what you ought to do in order to fulfil it, to implore the grace of God for your a&s;&s;i&s;tance in keeping it, to be upon your guard again&s;t what tempted you to the violation of it, to exert your&s;elves in &s;ome virtuous actions for which your &s;ituation gave an opportunity? Perhaps the di&s;po&s;ition was
<PB N="442" REF="437">
of &s;hort continuance; with the generality it is, alas, of very &s;hort continuance: but if it la&s;ted only for a day, it is &s;ufficient for a&s;cer|taining the natural tendency and the proper influence of virtuous re&s;olution. But if this be its genuine tendency, what rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, why you are not always in this good di&s;po&s;ition, but that you &s;uffer your re&s;olutions to wear off and lo&s;e their power? Did you, by frequently renewing them, pre&s;erve them in undecayed vigour, they would operate con|tinually in the &s;ame manner, and with equal efficacy. It is plain from the experience of the &s;aints. David never recollects his holy purpo&s;es, or thinks of the &s;ubject of them, but they prompt him to u&s;e &s;ome of the means of holine&s;s. <HI>Thou ha&s;t commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently: O that my ways were di|rected to keep thy &s;tatutes</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxix. 4, 5.</NOTE><HI>!

<P>V. FINALLY, Virtuous re&s;olution in&s;ti|gates us to virtue, by &s;ugge&s;ting the <HI>motives</HI> to it, keeping them in our view, and fixing our attention on them. When a man is once determined, he not only repre&s;ents to him&s;elf in the &s;tronge&s;t light, all the rea&s;ons which moved him to determine, but is at pains to &s;earch out rea&s;ons for adhering to his re&s;olu|tion, which never occurred to him when he was forming it. He will not be diverted from the execution of it, by much &s;tronger arguments than would have been &s;ufficient to prevent his entering into it. He is ingenious in finding topics to ju&s;tify it; he is anxious to confute every objection again&s;t his per&s;i&s;ting in it; and, if the re&s;olution happen to be impro|per, he will often &s;atisfy him&s;elf with the poore&s;t &s;ophi&s;ms and the &s;illie&s;t eva&s;ions, rather than abandon it. What effect is then &s;o great as not to be ju&s;tly expected from a &s;ettled re|&s;olution to practi&s;e holine&s;s? While it re|mains in force, it will lead us to meditate often
<PB N="444" REF="439">
upon all the motives to holine&s;s; it will keep them perpetually in our view. But they can|not be perpetually in our view, without excit|ing us to perpetual diligence in holine&s;s. They are &s;o weighty and of &s;uch eternal con&s;equence, that nothing but inattention to them can pre|vent their governing the world. They are derived from every topic which can intere&s;t us: they are addre&s;&s;ed to every principle which can actuate us. Duty, honour, utility; en|joyment in life, and comfort in the hour of death; pre&s;ent peace, and eternal happine&s;s; con&s;cience, gratitude, hope, and fear; all con|&s;pire in urging us to holine&s;s. Before their combined force all the mo&s;t &s;pecious pleas of vice mu&s;t vani&s;h. In this one p&s;alm, in what profu&s;ion are they &s;ugge&s;ted? in what &s;triking lights are they placed? with what force, and with what efficacy does David inculcate them upon him&s;elf? I remind you only of a few examples: <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord. They al&s;o do no iniquity. Then &s;hall I not be a&s;hamed, when I have re&s;pect unto all thy com|mandments.

By rendering &s;uch views of virtue familiar, by keeping them continually pre&s;ent to the mind, a re&s;olution, if it be but vigorous and &s;teady, mu&s;t urge us to virtue, with a force almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>THUS I have endeavoured to de&s;cribe the power of virtuous re&s;olutions, and to point out the &s;ources from which it is derived: by producing an obligation which we mu&s;t fulfil in order to avoid the humiliating &s;en&s;e of in|con&s;i&s;tency of character: by fixing holine&s;s as an end which we mu&s;t pur&s;ue, and impre&s;&s;ing an habitual bias to it: by conquering our re|luctance to the practice of it, and rendering it agreeable: by prompting us to the diligent u&s;e of all means of improvement in it: and
<PB N="446" REF="441">
by forcing all the &s;tronge&s;t incitements to it, continually into our thoughts: they turn the heart to holine&s;s, collect all the &s;trength of the &s;oul in this one de&s;ign, and in&s;tigate, &s;upport, a&s;&s;i&s;t, and invigorate all its efforts to accom|pli&s;h it. The practical improvement of this &s;ubject is obvious.</P>
<P>1. SINCE virtuous re&s;olutions are &s;uch power|ful in&s;truments of virtuous practice and improve|ment, we ought to form them with the greate&s;t &s;incerity, firmne&s;s, and care. The neglect of this is one of the principal cau&s;es of the corrup|tion of the world. Men go on in wickedne&s;s becau&s;e have they never re&s;olved to abandon it: they are at no pains to be virtuous becau&s;e they have never &s;eriou&s;ly thought of it. For a man's living in &s;in, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that he make a formal choice of it: it is enough that he has not re&s;olved again&s;t it; the &s;trength of temptation and the power of corrupt pa&s;&s;ions will precipitate him into it. But for our prac|ti&s;ing holine&s;s, for our per&s;i&s;ting in it, not|with&s;tanding all its difficulties, notwith&s;tand|ing the depre&s;&s;ions of infirmity, the im|pul&s;e of corruption, and the allurements of temptation, it is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary that we devote our&s;elves to it, and engage our&s;elves in it, by a fixed choice and re&s;olution. This is the point from which &s;teady virtue always
<PB N="447" REF="442">
takes its ri&s;e. In tho&s;e who are recovered to virtue after &s;ome time &s;pent in open vice, the re&s;olution to change their cour&s;e mu&s;t be very deliberate, formal, and explicit. But even when men have, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God on a religious education, been earlie&s;t and mo&s;t im|perceptibly initiated into virtue, their virtue is owing to a real choice of it, in&s;tilled from the fir&s;t, and habitually pre&s;erved and acted upon. If our be&s;t re&s;olutions cannot &s;ecure perfect pu|rity and immoveable con&s;tancy, &s;hall we con|clude that re&s;olution has no power? The con|clu&s;ion would contradict the plaine&s;t experi|ence of human life. We &s;hould conclude only, that our religious re&s;olutions are too feeble, that the difficulties of religion, and the weakne&s;s and corrupt propen&s;ities of man, require their being formed with the greate&s;t &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and rai&s;ed to the greate&s;t vi|gour, and maintained in unexhau&s;ted force. If our goodne&s;s be defective, if our &s;ins be many, notwith&s;tanding all our pains to enter into, and to inculcate upon our&s;elves re&s;olutions of univer&s;al holine&s;s, we mu&s;t have been void of goodne&s;s, and profligate in &s;in, if we had never made one re&s;olution to the contrary. It were folly not to avail our&s;elves of the great ad|vantages which re&s;olution gives for uniform and &s;teadfa&s;t virtue. If it be undertaken early, it will prevent a great deal of corruption, and
<PB N="448" REF="443">
labour, and remor&s;e, and mi&s;ery; it will &s;pread the happie&s;t influence over all the periods of life. When we are capable of chu&s;ing our occupation for this world, it is high time that we make the more important choice of our occupation for the other world. If we are de&s;igned for eternity, and if without virtue it is impo&s;&s;ible to be happy in eternity, we can|not too &s;peedily, or with too great deliberation and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, devote our&s;elves to the pur&s;uit of all that is <HI>true,</HI> and <HI>venerable,</HI> and <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> and <HI>pure,</HI> and <HI>lovely</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. iv. 8.</NOTE>. This is the plan and mo|del of life, which every man ought to pre|&s;cribe to him&s;elf, which he &s;hould be deter|mined to ob&s;erve and execute, alone and in company, in pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity, in every po&s;&s;ible &s;ituation. Chri&s;tianity demands it from all its profe&s;&s;ors. It requires it to be done in a manner the fitte&s;t for adding to its efficacy. It has in&s;tituted two &s;acraments for the pur|po&s;e. It has enforced the frequent ob&s;ervance of one of them, by making it the &s;ubject of Chri&s;t's dying precept. It has provided, that as many as have not ca&s;t off all regard to the voice of their expiring Saviour, &s;hall form and often renew the firm re&s;olution of univer&s;al ho|line&s;s, with the utmo&s;t deliberation and &s;o|lemnity; with their &s;ouls for a con&s;iderable time kept inten&s;ely bent upon it; with a bright
<PB N="449" REF="444">
di&s;play, full in their view, of every motive to the exact fulfilment of it; with their faith and honour, for the execution, plighted to their fellow-chri&s;tians; in a &s;triking act of im|mediate wor&s;hip, which gives it all the autho|rity and energy of a religious vow, and is an appointed, and therefore, a powerful means, of drawing down abundant &s;howers of cele&s;tial grace, to nouri&s;h and invigorate it, and to rai&s;e from it the precious fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>2. HAVING &s;incerely re&s;olved to practi&s;e univer&s;al holine&s;s, let us diligently and faith|fully fulfil the re&s;olution. From the power of re&s;olution this may rea&s;onably be expected. We daily find men unalterably con&s;tant in re|&s;olutions of &s;mall importance. We find them inflexibly ob&s;tinate in evil purpo&s;es. Strange that we &s;hould be irre&s;olute only in that in which it is of &s;upreme importance to be re&s;o|lute and unmoveable! that in religion alone we &s;uffer the force of re&s;olution to be &s;ubdued by every foe! By allowing it to langui&s;h with|out producing its effect, by neglecting to act upon it, by fainting in the accompli&s;hment of it, we fru&s;trate one of the mo&s;t powerful in|&s;truments which religion contains for the re|formation of our lives and the improvement of our hearts; and we render our&s;elves in a great mea&s;ure incapable of being profited by any of

the re&s;t. Excellent as it is, it is but a means of holine&s;s; it derives all its value from its &s;ub&s;ervience to this end; it is labour lo&s;t if it fail of promoting it. It is only for the &s;ake of the execution, that the formation of holy purpo&s;es is enjoined. God will not accept of purpo&s;es in&s;tead of practice; he will not be &s;atisfied with inefficient promi&s;es. His voice is, <HI>Vow and pay unto the Lord your God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxxvi. 11.</NOTE>.

<P>ALL the varieties that can occur in hu|man life, fall under two general heads, pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity. Some &s;pend the greate&s;t part of their time in one of the&s;e &s;tates, and &s;ome in the other; but every man has experience of both. Both may be im|proved &s;o as to promote the great end of life, our education for eternity; for each inculcates peculiar le&s;&s;ons, and puts us upon congruous exerci&s;es, which tend to form our hearts to virtue, and to produce &s;uch habits as may pre|pare us for the enjoyment of pure and perfect happine&s;s. But adver&s;ity has been always found the more &s;ucce&s;sful teacher of the two. Its di&s;cipline is indeed &s;evere: de&s;irous of pre|&s;ent
<PB N="454" REF="448">
ea&s;e, we naturally fly from it; and when it overtakes us, we u&s;e every endeavour to e&s;cape from its gra&s;p as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Its in&s;truc|tions are, however, &s;o important, that the per&s;on who e&s;timates them ju&s;tly, will reckon its future &s;alutary effects &s;ufficient motives to patience and re&s;ignation under the pre&s;ent evil.</P>
<P>IF neverthele&s;s a method could be di&s;co|vered, by which we might obtain the benefits of adver&s;ity without being &s;ubjected to its pains; a method by which the pro&s;perous, without relinqui&s;hing their pro&s;perity, might learn to &s;teer their cour&s;e through life, with that &s;edatene&s;s which re&s;ults from afflictions well improved; who would be &s;o incon&s;iderate, &s;o indifferent to his own greate&s;t good, as not eagerly to embrace it? Who would not rejoice in the opportunity of becoming wi&s;e and vir|tuous at &s;o cheap a rat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">? Yet this very op|portunity is every day pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ted to men, and every day neglected by them. Ob&s;ervation of the afflictions of others, has the &s;ame tendency with experience of our own. So much is our nature formed for &s;ocial connections, that the condition of others becomes in &s;ome degree our own, and fills our hearts either with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ym|pathetic joy, or with compa&s;&s;ionate grief. The happie&s;t of mankind may, as often as they plea&s;e, contemplate the calamities of their
<PB N="455" REF="449">
neighbours; and from the well directed con|templation of them derive almo&s;t the &s;ame ad|vantages as from bearing calamity them&s;elves. But the very cau&s;es which render us unwilling to be our&s;elves afflicted, often prevent our fixing our attention on the afflictions of other men: they depre&s;s our &s;pirits, they excite un|ea&s;y feelings, they occa&s;ion pre&s;ent di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction. The &s;orrow indeed, which they pro|duce, is not pure or unallayed; by the wi&s;e and gracious con&s;titution of human nature, there is an attraction in di&s;tre&s;s, which en|gaging our benevolence, draws us towards tho&s;e who labour under it, even when we can only commi&s;erate, but have it not in our power to bring them relief: yet &s;cenes of gaiety have often force enough to divert us from hearkening to this propen&s;ity; their fa&s;|cination overcomes the attraction of di&s;tre&s;s: they elevate our hearts, they dilate them with chearful &s;en&s;ations, they introduce a train of plea&s;ant emotions, they give pre&s;ent &s;atisfac|tion; and therefore we think it more eligible to witne&s;s them, to a&s;&s;ociate with &s;uch as revel in them, than to conver&s;e with the children of &s;orrow, and to fix a &s;teady eye upon the calamities of human life. When the&s;e compel us to behold them, when their &s;triking cir|cum&s;tances, or our own relation to the per&s;ons whom they have befallen, irre&s;i&s;tibly arre&s;t
<PB N="456" REF="450">
our notice, we too often view them but in|&s;tinctively; we gaze upon them, and &s;hed a tear; but we indulge none of tho&s;e u&s;eful re|flections which would have a permanent in|fluence upon our temper and our conduct. If &s;uch reflections happen to ari&s;e &s;pontaneou&s;ly, we quickly bani&s;h them as intruders; we &s;hrink back from the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s which they would introduce, and &s;eek relief in mirth and di&s;&s;ipation. This is to prefer the &s;atisfaction of the pre&s;ent moment, to the la&s;ting improve|ment of the heart. It may be more agreeable to view the glitter of pro&s;perity, and to partake in the laughter and levity of the pro&s;perous; but it is incomparably more u&s;eful to enter into the &s;orrows of the afflicted, to ponder the evils of life, and to pur&s;ue the thoughts which a &s;e|rious view of them in&s;pires. This is the judgement which the wi&s;e man pronounces in my text; <HI>It is better to go to the hou&s;e of mourn|ing, than to go to the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting:</HI> for that he means, con&s;idering the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others, not enduring our own, is evident from what he adds, <HI>For that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart.</HI> He has par|ticularly in his eye the la&s;t evil incident to man; he points at the benefit that the living may derive from meditation on the in&s;tances of mortality which &s;urround them, and in which affection often gives them a melancholy in|tere&s;t;
<PB N="457" REF="451">
but we need not &s;uppo&s;e that he ex|cludes the benefit which wi&s;e &s;pectators may receive from con&s;idering other evils, in which likewi&s;e they are concerned only by &s;ympathy with the &s;ufferers.</P>
<P>SOLOMON was deeply &s;killed in human life, he was acquainted with all the circum&s;tances by which it is diver&s;ified, he under&s;tood the nature and the tendency of all the events which fill it up; and he had learned to mea|&s;ure the u&s;efulne&s;s of things, not by their fit|ne&s;s to gratify inclination, or to give imme|diate plea&s;ure, but by their efficacy in forming the heart, and promoting &s;piritual improve|ment. On this principle it is, that his wi&s;|dom, guided by God's unerring Spirit, declares, That <HI>to go to the hou&s;e of mourning,</HI> to be willingly and familiarly conver&s;ant with &s;cenes of &s;orrow and &s;uffering, <HI>is better than to go to the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting,</HI> to be engro&s;&s;ed by objects of fe&s;tivity, jollity, pomp, or &s;plendour. To the gayer part of mankind, to tho&s;e in every &s;tation who give a loo&s;e to levity and thought|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, this maxim will doubtle&s;s &s;eem a pa|radox; but it is a truth of the mo&s;t unque&s;|tionable certainty, and the mo&s;t capital im|portance. It is better, becau&s;e it is more u&s;e|ful; and it is more u&s;eful, becau&s;e it is likely to have a more beneficial influence on our
<PB N="458" REF="452">
temper and our conduct; becau&s;e it is more conducive to our religious and moral culture, and our real happine&s;s. That in this deci&s;ive point of view, <HI>the hou&s;e of mourning</HI> is prefer|able to <HI>the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting,</HI> I undertake to evince, by a compari&s;on of both, in re&s;pect of the general temper and di&s;po&s;ition which they form, in re&s;pect of the &s;entiments which they &s;ugge&s;t, and in re&s;pect of the affections which they draw out into exerci&s;e, and render habi|tual.</P>
<P>FIRST, As to the general temper which they form: <HI>to go to the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting,</HI> tends to produce levity and di&s;&s;ipation; but <HI>to go to the hou&s;e of mourning,</HI> fixes the &s;oul in a temper of &s;edatene&s;s, &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>A VERY little recollection will convince you, that a run of good &s;ucce&s;s, a train of gay avocations, or a cour&s;e of amu&s;ements, &s;eldom fail to render men, in &s;ome degree, light and volatile, thoughtle&s;s and unreflecting. They leave neither inclination nor capacity for the labours which attend a clo&s;e application to any &s;ubject. They benumb the under&s;tand|ing, enervate the affections, relax all the powers of the &s;oul, and throw it into an in|&s;ignificant flutter. The jollity which &s;cenes of fe&s;tivity excite, is of a di&s;&s;olving, debili|tating
<PB N="459" REF="453">
nature. It is a &s;welling, rather than an elevation of heart. It is a fever, not a bri&s;k and healthful circulation. It is apter to divert us from virtuous offices altogether, than to render us chearful and active in performing them. Intoxicated with it, we are too giddy to be able to ponder the moment of our actions; too much off our guard to elude the deceitful|ne&s;s of &s;in, and the in&s;inuations of temptation; too incon&s;iderate for embracing opportunities of doing good; and too effeminate for exert|ing our&s;elves in order to improve them. <HI>I &s;aid of laughter, it is mad; and of mirth, what doth it</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccl. ii. 2.</NOTE>? It yields no manly enjoyment, and it unfits us for virtue and religion. The im|provident, unthinking temper which it fo&s;ters, is one of the principal cau&s;es of tho&s;e vices which have over-run the world. It is only in the &s;edate and recollected &s;oul, that virtue can flouri&s;h and grow up to vigour and matu|rity.</P>
<P>THIS is the very character which attention to di&s;tre&s;s is directly calculated to form. Di&s;|tre&s;s is indeed a gloomy object. When the unprincipled or the ungoverned mind fir&s;t en|ters into the contemplation of it, it may be &s;unk into melancholy, rai&s;ed into violent agi|tations
<PB N="460" REF="454">
of grief, or broken into peevi&s;hne&s;s and di&s;content, very unfriendly to virtue, as oppo&s;ite to its benign exertions, as even the profu&s;e&s;t mirth and levity can be to the &s;o|lemnity of its duties. But if the &s;oul be at all prepared&punc; for meeting the &s;hocks of &s;or|row, familiarity with the &s;ufferings of the af|flicted will produce no more than a moderate concern, a nece&s;&s;ary degree of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. It will not lift up the pa&s;&s;ions into tempe&s;tuous billows; it will only collect them into &s;obriety of mind. A proper &s;en&s;e of the calamities in|cident to man &s;wallows up all trivial emotions, and occupies the whole &s;oul with one import|ant feeling. It becomes recollected in it&s;elf; it acquires an attentive frame; it is well di&s;|po&s;ed to caution, circum&s;pection, and con&s;i|deration. It is this happy temper that attunes the heart to virtue. The man in whom it prevails, is always &s;olicitous to act aright, and always capable of acting aright. He is fit for &s;elf-government, &s;teadine&s;s, and con&s;i&s;t|ency of conduct. He has a defence again&s;t every temptation to &s;in; for he is enough ma&s;|ter of him&s;elf to perceive its tendency, and to detect its in&s;ignificance. He can calmly ex|amine the value of every object, and canvas the claim of every vice. In vain does fancy throw a fal&s;e colouring over it; he is proof again&s;t the deceit; his rea&s;on is awake to di&s;|cern

the artificial varni&s;h, and his con&s;cience is active to rai&s;e a dete&s;tation of its natural de|formity. He is prepared for de&s;pi&s;ing all tho&s;e &s;light allurements which &s;educe the thoughtle&s;s from the diligent practice of holi|ne&s;s, and from per&s;evering efforts to reach the perfection of their nature.</P>
<P>SUCH is the general temper to which we &s;hall be formed by going to <HI>the hou&s;e of mourn|ing:</HI> and when we con&s;ider this temper as fun|damental to religion, as e&s;&s;ential to purity, blamele&s;&s;ne&s;s, con&s;tancy, and uniformity of character; this alone is &s;ufficient to con&s;train us, however much inclination may oppo&s;e the conce&s;&s;ion, in our judgment, in our con&s;ci|ence to acknowledge that it is far better to vi&s;it the comfortle&s;s abodes of poverty and pain, of di&s;ea&s;e and death, forbidding as they &s;eem to be; than to frequent places of the gaye&s;t entertainment, the loude&s;t mirth, or the mo&s;t inviting and agreeable amu&s;ements. <HI>The heart,</HI> the delight, <HI>of the wi&s;e is the hou&s;e of mourn|ing;</HI> and that only <HI>of fools in the hou&s;e of mirth</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccl. vii. 4.</NOTE>.</P>

<PB N="462" REF="456">
re&s;pect of the &s;entiments which it &s;ugge&s;ts. The latter diverts us from meditation on any &s;ubjects of a &s;erious or important nature; the former forces into our view the mo&s;t important, the mo&s;t deeply intere&s;ting &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>GAIETY does not penetrate the heart &s;o deeply as concern; but it in &s;ome &s;en&s;e en|gro&s;&s;es it more entirely. It in a great mea&s;ure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ulls the thinking powers a&s;leep, &s;u&s;pends the exerci&s;e of thought, and unhinges the train of our ideas. It breaks the bands by which our pre&s;ent perceptions draw others into our view. It annihilates the gale which carries us forward, in a regular direction from &s;entiment to &s;enti|ment. The mind is like a &s;hip becalmed, incapable of motion; or it is the &s;port of light and un&s;teady breezes &s;hifting every moment from point to point; it can make no progre&s;s, it can only roll in its pre&s;ent place; it cannot advance in any cour&s;e of regular meditation. Gay ideas can introduce none but gay ideas. Their agreeable titillation indi&s;po&s;es us for every thought except what regards the enjoy|ment of the pre&s;ent, or the anticipation of a future amu&s;ement. All tho&s;e religious princi|ples which can either re&s;train from vice or in|&s;tigate to virtue, &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid the circles of levity and di&s;&s;ipation: if they &s;hould happen to enter into them, they would be received
<PB N="463" REF="457">
with coldne&s;s, or turned out as impertinent intruders.</P>
<P>BUT all that we meet with in <HI>the hou&s;e of mourning,</HI> naturally &s;ugge&s;ts many of the mo&s;t important ideas; and the &s;adne&s;s of heart which it in&s;pires prepares us for feeling all their force. The contemplation of di&s;tre&s;s not only inclines us to attention, but calls up the mo&s;t u&s;eful objects on which we can be|&s;tow our attention. It almo&s;t con&s;trains us to recollect and to ponder &s;ome of tho&s;e awful truths, and awakening con&s;iderations, which are the &s;tronge&s;t motives to the right di&s;|charge of every duty. When we enter by &s;ympathy, into the &s;orrows of others, though the heart embraces the painful &s;en&s;ation which they have produced, and enjoys a &s;weet &s;ati&s;|faction in it, yet it avoids clinging too clo&s;ely to it. It runs &s;pontaneou&s;ly into &s;uch views as may relieve or vary its unea&s;ine&s;s without extingui&s;hing the &s;oft emotion in which it is involved. Both our pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition and the objects which engage our notice, lead us naturally into &s;uch tracks of thinking as are analogous and congruous to &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and concern. It is only from &s;uch that we can find relief. Should gay ideas be accidentally forced upon us, in&s;tead of mitigating our &s;or|row, they would imbitter it; their continu|ance

would render it in&s;upportable; we &s;hould run eage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly into graver reflections as the only means of alleviating it. Sorrow creates a &s;ort of appetite for pain; it cau&s;es us to reject chear|fulne&s;s with loathing and di&s;gu&s;t. It delights in being indulged; it is more effectually &s;oothed by the &s;erious thoughts to which we are prompted by it&s;elf; and for this rea&s;on it determines us to dwell upon them. There is not a &s;ingle &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s in which we can ob&s;erve our fellow-men, our neighbours or our friends, that does not naturally lead us to u&s;e|ful meditations.

Di&s;tre&s;s puts it in our power to improve our kind affections, not only by indulging their inward workings, but al&s;o by putting them forth into act. We can often a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who labour under it; we can often extenuate or relieve their &s;ufferings by our advice or by our timely &s;uccour; we

can always give them that con&s;olation which re&s;ults from the &s;en&s;e of our &s;ympathizing with their pains. By accu&s;toming our&s;elves thus to give them ea&s;e, we &s;hall advance in that brotherly love which of is &s;o great im|portance in the Chri&s;tian temper, that our Saviour has made it the di&s;tinctive characteri&s;tic of his genuine di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>CONSIDERATION of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which are common in human life, and which many around us labour under, is no le&s;s fit for ex|citing and improving pious affections to that God who <HI>maketh &s;ore, and bindeth up;</HI> who <HI>woundeth, and his hands make whole</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job v. 18.</NOTE>.

When pro&s;perity is &s;o intoxicating, if we en|joy it unimpaired, can we e&s;cape its baneful influence, without &s;etting our&s;elves to ponder the adver&s;ities under which others groan? If we &s;aw nothing around us but the glitter of pro&s;perity, we could &s;carcely fail to lo&s;e all &s;en&s;e of God. It is when they fix their eyes on the calamities of which the world is &s;o full, which many of their neighbours feel, and to which they al&s;o are obnoxious; that the pro|&s;perous are awakened to &s;obriety of mind, re|called to them&s;elves, and to the acknowledge|ment of a God, <HI>in who&s;e hand is the breath of all mankind</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xii. 10.</NOTE>, who <HI>taketh away,</HI> and none <HI>can hinder him,</HI> nor <HI>&s;ay unto him, what do&s;t thou</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Chap. ix. 12.</NOTE>.

Religion is the only a&s;ylum of the afflicted; and therefore famili|arity with affliction cannot fail to in&s;tigate every man of prudence to &s;ecure its protection in the day of trouble, by having recour&s;e to it while the candle of the Lord yet &s;hines upon him. You would think your &s;ituation di&s;mal, if you found your&s;elves, your families, and your friends, in a dreary wilderne&s;s, without a mor&s;el of bread, without a drop of water, without a guide, without defence or refuge from the wild bea&s;ts that howled on every &s;ide. You would be incon&s;olable, if you &s;hould awake, with all who are deare&s;t to you, in a leaky ve&s;&s;el, without a pilot, in a tempe&s;tuous,

To the man who is a &s;tranger to religion, who lives without God, who has no regard to him nor intere&s;t in him, this world is a drearier wil|derne&s;s, and a more tempe&s;tuous ocean. Amid&s;t numberle&s;s calamities, which he &s;ees every moment raging all around him, and which he has neither power nor prudence to avert from him&s;elf, he has no director, no guardian, no hope, no con&s;olation. That man alone is ble&s;&s;ed, who can &s;ay unto God, <HI>Neverthele&s;s I am continually with thee: thou ha&s;t holden me by my right hand: thou &s;halt guide me with thy coun&s;el, and afterward re|ceive me to glory</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxxxiii. 23, 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CONSIDERATION of adver&s;ity tends al&s;o to form our hearts to re&s;olution, fortitude, and patience. Pro&s;perity enervates the &s;oul; con|tinued gaiety and di&s;&s;ipation render it too deli|cate to bear the &s;lighte&s;t &s;hock.

of di&s;tre&s;s will contribute to it not a lit|tle; it will prepare us for bearing our own troubles, and it will &s;hew us the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;trengthening our&s;elves to bear them. To be|fall us unexpectedly, doubles the &s;everity of every affliction. By being &s;eriou&s;ly contem|plated beforehand, it is rendered familiar to us, its a&s;pect becomes le&s;s formidable, we have time to excite our courage, and to collect all the vigour of our &s;ouls for encountering it. If we frequently turn our eyes to the dark &s;ide of human life, we cannot avoid di&s;cerning that the lot of every man is inevitably checquered with &s;orrow. By the irrever&s;ible &s;entence of God, the whole creation is <HI>&s;ubjected to vanity</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 20.</NOTE>. <HI>To every thing there is a &s;ea&s;on, and a time to every purpo&s;e under heaven; a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccl. iii. 1, 2, 4.</NOTE>. It is in vain to expect exemption from calamity. All that we can do, is to re|concile our&s;elves to it as much as po&s;&s;ible, to prepare our&s;elves for bearing it whenever it &s;hall come, and on the foundation of pious re|&s;ignation, to build up fortitude, that we may not repine at <HI>the cha&s;tening of the Lord, nor faint when we are rebuked of him</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 5.</NOTE>. That it would be inexcu&s;eable to faint, attention to
<PB N="479" REF="473">
the calamities of others is &s;ufficient to convince us: we may &s;ee &s;ome &s;ubjected to heavier ca|lamities than we endure, or have rea&s;on to apprehend.</P>
<P>So different, &s;o contrary are the tendencies of <HI>the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting</HI> and <HI>the hou&s;e of mourning.</HI> The former di&s;&s;olves the &s;oul in levity, di&s;|pels all profitable thoughts, and gives no &s;cope to the exerci&s;e of any good affection: the latter compo&s;es the mind into &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and recol|lection, &s;ugge&s;ts the mo&s;t important and in|&s;tructive truths, and draws out and improves the noble&s;t virtues. Our duty, therefore, is clear with re&s;pect to both.</P>
<P>SINCE the gaieties and the enjoyments of life tend rather to corrupt than to improve the heart, we ought to be very moderate in the indulgence of them. If at any time it appear difficult to fix the preci&s;e point where modera|tion ends, it is much &s;afer to ab&s;tain unnece&s;|&s;arily, than to incur a po&s;&s;ibility of exceeding. To make mirth, and jollity, and plea&s;ure, and amu&s;ement, the bu&s;ine&s;s of our lives; for the &s;ake of them, to neglect the call of any duty; to be&s;tow on them the hour which we have an inviting opportunity of employing to worthier purpo&s;es; is indi&s;putably to exceed. The mo&s;t innocent of the kind &s;hould be indulged but
<PB N="480" REF="474">
rarely, and for a &s;hort time, as nece&s;&s;ary re|laxations. De&s;picable is the life that is wa&s;ted in thoughtle&s;s di&s;&s;ipation and fe&s;tivity. It is remarked to the di&s;honour of the rich man mentioned in the go&s;pel, that he <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ared &s;ump|tuou&s;ly every day</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xvi. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">9.</NOTE>. <HI>She that liveth in plea|&s;ure, is dead while &s;he liveth</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Tim. v. 6.</NOTE>. Life is given us for infinitely more important purpo&s;es. To be intoxicated with the love of plea&s;ure; to be unhappy in the want of gay entertainments; by the u&s;e of them to contract a di&s;reli&s;h for the bu&s;ine&s;s of life and the occupations of re|ligion; to run into &s;uch of them as are in the lea&s;t degree unlawful in their nature; is alike below the dignity, and contrary to the duty of creatures who are rea&s;onable and immortal. But from tho&s;e who are con&s;tantly at ea&s;e, it will require the mo&s;t careful circum&s;pection always to avoid it. It will require &s;uch a jealous vigilance over them&s;elves, as Job ex|erci&s;ed over his &s;ons: <HI>when the days of their fea&s;ting were gone about, he &s;ent and &s;anctified them, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job &s;aid, it may be that my &s;ons have &s;inned, and cur&s;ed God in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> hearts</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ob i. 5.</NOTE>. In &s;ea&s;ons of the highe&s;t fe&s;tivity, let us beware of abandoning our&s;elves to levity: let a &s;en&s;e of God, mixing with our relaxa|tions, pre&s;erve them moderate and innocent.</P>
<P><PB N="481" REF="475">LET our enjoyment of our own pro&s;perity be accompanied by a tender &s;en&s;ibility to the &s;ufferings of others. We are not required to dwell in <HI>the hou&s;e of mourning:</HI> but in many ways we are called upon to pay it frequent vi&s;its. For this very end, compa&s;&s;ion is made one of the &s;tronge&s;t movements of the human heart. In compa&s;&s;ionating di&s;tre&s;s, we ta&s;te a &s;olemn, &s;erious plea&s;ure, deeper and more la&s;t|ing than all the joys of mirth.

To be unpitied in di&s;tre&s;s, to be neglected by neighbours, to be for&s;aken by former friends, &s;trikes a dagger into the wounded heart. It was with angui&s;h of &s;oul that Job exclaimed, <HI>my brethren have dealt de|ceitfully as a brook, and as the &s;tream of brooks they pa&s;s away; which are blacki&s;h by rea&s;on of the ice, and wherein the &s;now is hid; what time they wax warm, they vani&s;h; when it is hot, they are con&s;umed out of their place</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job vi. 15, 16, 17.</NOTE>.

The being involved in a common danger, is generally a bond of the &s;tricte&s;t union. If credit be due to hi&s;tory, the fierce&s;t animals have &s;ometimes laid a&s;ide their fiercene&s;s, and ab|&s;tained from their prey, when along with it they were &s;urprized into a &s;ituation of immi|nent di&s;tre&s;s.

The &s;ame &s;oothing pity, the &s;ame kind attention, which this hour would pour balm into our neighbour's wounds, we our&s;elves may need the next.
