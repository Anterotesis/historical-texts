<P>PERHAPS it may be nece&s;&s;ary to in|form
the Public, that not long &s;ince an
Examination of the Fifteenth and Six|teenth
Chapters of the Hi&s;tory of the Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire was publi&s;hed
by Mr. Davis. He &s;tyles him&s;elf a Bachelor
of Arts, and a Member of Baliol College in the
Univer&s;ity of Oxford. His title-page is a de|claration
of war, and in the pro&s;ecution of his
religious cru&s;ade, he a&s;&s;umes a privilege of
di&s;regarding the ordinary laws which are re|&s;pected
in the mo&s;t ho&s;tile tran&s;actions between
civilized men or civilized nations. Some of
the har&s;he&s;t epithets in the Engli&s;h language
are repeatedly applied to the hi&s;torian, a part
<PB N="2" REF="4">
of who&s;e work Mr. Davis has cho&s;en for the
object of his critici&s;m. To this author Mr.
Davis imputes the crime of betraying the con|fidence
and &s;educing the faith of tho&s;e readers,
who may heedle&s;sly &s;tray in the flowery paths
of his diction, without perceiving the poi&s;onous
&s;nake that lurks concealed in the gra&s;s. <HI>Latet
anguis in herb&acirc;.</HI> The Examiner has a&s;&s;umed the
province of reminding them of <Q REND="inline">the unfair
proceedings of &s;uch an in&s;idious friend, who
offers the deadly draught in a golden cup,
that they may be le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the danger<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Davis, Preface, p. ii.</NOTE>.
In order to which, Mr. Davis has &s;elected
&s;everal of the more notorious in&s;tances of his
mi&s;repre&s;entations and errors; reducing them
to their re&s;pective heads, and &s;ubjoining a
long li&s;t of almo&s;t incredible inaccuracies:
and &s;uch &s;triking proofs of &s;ervile plagiari&s;m,
as the world will be &s;urpri&s;ed to meet with
in an author who puts in &s;o bold a claim to
originality and exten&s;ive reading<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Preface, p. iii.</NOTE>?</Q> Mr.
Davis pro&s;ecutes this attack through an octavo
volume of not le&s;s than two hundred and eighty-four
pages with the &s;ame implacable &s;pirit, per|petually
charges his adver&s;ary with perverting
the ancients, and tran&s;cribing the moderns;
and incon&s;i&s;tently enough imputes to him the
oppo&s;ite crimes of art and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, of gro&s;s
<PB N="3" REF="5">
ignorance and of wilful fal&s;ehood. The Exa|miner
clo&s;es his work<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 282, 283.</NOTE> with a &s;evere reproof of
tho&s;e feeble critics who have allowed any &s;hare
of knowledge to an odious antagoni&s;t. He pre|&s;umes
to pity and to condemn the fir&s;t hi&s;torian
of the pre&s;ent age, for the generous approba|tion
which he had be&s;towed on a writer who is
content that Mr. Davis &s;hould be his enemy,
whil&s;t he has a right to name Dr. Robert&s;on
for his friend.</P>
<P>When I delivered to the world the Fir&s;t Vo|lume
of an important Hi&s;tory, in which I had
been obliged to connect the progre&s;s of Chri&s;|tianity
with the civil &s;tate and revolutions of
the Roman Empire, I could not be ignorant
that the re&s;ult of my inquiries might offend the
intere&s;t of &s;ome and the opinions of others. If
the whole work was favourably received by the
Public, I had the more rea&s;on to expect that
this obnoxious part would provoke the zeal
of tho&s;e who con&s;ider them&s;elves as the
Watchmen of the Holy City. The&s;e expecta|tions
were not di&s;appointed; and a fruitful
crop of An&s;wers, Apologies, Remarks, Exa|minations,
&amp;c. &s;prung up with all convenient
&s;peed. As &s;oon as I &s;aw the adverti&s;ement, I
generally &s;ent for them; for I have never af|fected,
indeed I have never under&s;tood, the
<PB N="4" REF="6">
&s;toical apathy, the proud contempt of criti|ci&s;m,
which &s;ome authors have publicly pro|fe&s;&s;ed.
Fame is the motive, it is the reward,
of our labours; nor can I ea&s;ily comprehend
how it is po&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould remain cold
and indifferent with regard to the attempts
which are made to deprive us of the mo&s;t va|luable
object of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, or at lea&s;t of
our hopes. Be&s;ides this &s;trong and natural
impul&s;e of curio&s;ity, I was prompted by the
more laudable de&s;ire of applying to my own,
and the public, benefit, the well-grounded cen|&s;ures
of a learned adver&s;ary; and of correcting
tho&s;e faults which the indulgence of vanity and
friend&s;hip had &s;uffered to e&s;cape without ob&s;er|vation.
I read with attention &s;everal critici&s;ms
which were publi&s;hed again&s;t the Two la&s;t Chap|ters
of my Hi&s;tory, and unle&s;s I much deceive
my&s;elf, I weighed them in my own mind with|out
prejudice and without re&s;entment. After
I had clearly &s;atisfied my&s;elf that their principal
objections were founded on mi&s;repre&s;entation or
mi&s;take, I declined with &s;incere and di&s;inte|re&s;ted
reluctance the odious ta&s;k of controver&s;y,
and almo&s;t formed a tacit re&s;olution of com|mitting
my intentions, my writings, and my
adver&s;aries to the judgment of the Public, of
who&s;e favourable di&s;po&s;ition I had received the
mo&s;t flattering proofs.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">
The rea&s;ons which ju&s;tified my &s;ilence were
obvious and forcible: the re&s;pectable nature of
the &s;ubject it&s;elf, which ought not to be lightly
violated by the rude hand of controver&s;y; the
inevitable tendency of di&s;pute, which &s;oon de|generates
into minute and per&s;onal altercation;
the indifference of the Public for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion
of &s;uch que&s;tions as neither relate to the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
nor the amu&s;ement of the pre&s;ent age. I
calculated the po&s;&s;ible lo&s;s of temper and the
certain lo&s;s of time, and con&s;idered, that while
I was laboriou&s;ly engaged in a humiliating ta&s;k,
which could add nothing to my own reputa|tion,
or to the entertainment of my readers, I
mu&s;t interrupt the pro&s;ecution of a work which
claimed my whole attention, and which the
Public, or at lea&s;t my friends, &s;eemed to re|quire
with &s;ome impatience at my hands. The
judicious lines of Dr. Young &s;ometimes offered
them&s;elves to my memory, and I felt the truth
of his ob&s;ervation, That every author lives or
dies by his own pen, and that the unerring
&s;entence of Time a&s;&s;igns its proper rank to every
compo&s;ition and to every critici&s;m, which it
pre&s;erves from oblivion.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have con&s;ulted my own ea&s;e, and
perhaps I &s;hould have acted in &s;tricter confor|mity
to the rules of prudence, if I had &s;till
per&s;evered in patient &s;ilence. But Mr. Davis
may, if he plea&s;es, a&s;&s;ume the merit of extort|ing
<PB N="6" REF="8">
from me the notice which I had refu&s;ed to
more honourable foes. I had declined the
con&s;ideration of their <HI>literary Objections</HI>; but he
has compelled me to give an an&s;wer to his <HI>crimi|nal
Accu&s;ations.</HI> Had he confined him&s;elf to the
ordinary, and indeed ob&s;olete charges of impi|ous
principles, and criminal intentions, I &s;hould
have acknowledged with readine&s;s and plea&s;ure
that the religion of Mr. Davis appeared to be
very different from mine. Had he contented
him&s;elf with the u&s;e of that &s;tyle which decency
and politene&s;s have bani&s;hed from the more
liberal part of mankind, I &s;hould have &s;miled,
perhaps with &s;ome contempt, but without the
lea&s;t mixture of anger or re&s;entment. Every
animal employs the note, or cry, or howl,
which is peculiar to its &s;pecies; every man ex|pre&s;&s;es
him&s;elf in the dialect the mo&s;t congenial
to his temper and inclination, the mo&s;t fami|liar
to the company in which he has lived, and
to the authors with whom he is conver&s;ant;
and while I was di&s;po&s;ed to allow that Mr.
Davis had made &s;ome proficiency in Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
Studies, I &s;hould have con&s;idered the
difference of our language and manners as an
un&s;urmountable bar of &s;eparation between us.
Mr. Davis has overleaped that bar, and forces
me to contend with him on the very dirty
ground which he has cho&s;en for the &s;cene of
<PB N="7" REF="9">
our combat. He has judged, I know not with
how much propriety, that the &s;upport of a cau&s;e,
which would di&s;claim &s;uch unworthy a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
depended on the ruin of my moral and literary
character. The different mi&s;repre&s;entations,
of which he has drawn out the ignominious ca|talogue,
would materially affect my credit as
an hi&s;torian, my reputation as a &s;cholar, and
even my honour and veracity as a gentleman.
If I am indeed incapable of under&s;tanding
what I read, I can no longer claim a place
among tho&s;e writers who merit the e&s;teem and
confidence of the Public. If I am capable of
wilfully perverting what I under&s;tand, I no
longer de&s;erve to live in the &s;ociety of tho&s;e
men, who con&s;ider a &s;trict and inviolable ad|herence
to truth, as the foundation of every
thing that is virtuous or honourable in human
nature. At the &s;ame time, I am not in&s;en&s;ible
that his mode of attack has given a tran&s;ient
plea&s;ure to my enemies, and a tran&s;ient unea&s;i|ne&s;s
to my friends. The &s;ize of his volume,
the boldne&s;s of his a&s;&s;ertions, the acrimony of
his &s;tyle, are contrived with tolerable &s;kill to
confound the ignorance and candour of his
readers. There are few who will examine the
truth or ju&s;tice of his accu&s;ations; and of tho&s;e
per&s;ons who have been directed by their edu|cation
to the &s;tudy of eccle&s;ia&s;tical antiquity,
<PB N="8" REF="10">
many will believe, or will affect to believe;
that the &s;ucce&s;s of their champion has been
equal to his zeal, and that the <HI>&s;erpent</HI> pierced
with an hundred wounds lies expiring at his
feet. Mr. Davis's book <HI>will</HI> cea&s;e to be read
(perhaps the grammarians may already reproach
me for the u&s;e of an improper ten&s;e); but the
oblivion towards which it &s;eems to be ha&s;ten|ing,
will afford the more ample &s;cope for the
artful practices of tho&s;e, who may not &s;cruple
to affirm, or rather to in&s;inuate, that Mr.
Gibbon was publickly convicted of fal&s;ehood
and mi&s;repre&s;entation; that the evidence pro|duced
again&s;t him was unan&s;werable; and that
his &s;ilence was the effect and the proof of con|&s;cious
guilt. Under the hands of a malicious
&s;urgeon, the &s;ting of a wa&s;p may continue to
fe&s;ter and inflame, long after the vexatious
little in&s;ect has left its venom and its life in the
wound.</P>
<P>The defence of my own honour is undoubt|edly
the fir&s;t and prevailing motive which urges
me to repel with vigour an unju&s;t and unpro|voked
attack; and to undertake a tedious
vindication, which, after the perpetual re|petition
of the vaine&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting
of the pronouns, will only prove that <HI>I</HI>
am innocent; and that Mr. Davis, in his
charge, has very frequently &s;ub&s;cribed his
<PB N="9" REF="11">
own condemnation. And yet I may pre&s;ume
to affirm, that the Public have &s;ome intere&s;t in
this controver&s;y. They have &s;ome intere&s;t to
know whether the writer whom they have ho|noured
with their favour is de&s;erving of their
confidence, whether they mu&s;t content them|&s;elves
with reading the Hi&s;tory of the Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire as a <HI>tale amu&s;ing
enough,</HI> or whether they may venture to receive
it as a fair and authentic hi&s;tory. The general
per&s;ua&s;ion of mankind, that where <HI>much</HI> has
been po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted, <HI>&s;omething</HI> mu&s;t be true,
may contribute to encourage a &s;ecret &s;u&s;picion,
which would naturally diffu&s;e it&s;elf over the
whole body of the work. Some of tho&s;e friends
who may now tax me with imprudence for
taking this public notice of Mr. Davis's book,
have perhaps already condemned me for &s;ilently
acquie&s;cing under the weight of &s;uch &s;erious,
&s;uch direct, and &s;uch circum&s;tantial imputa|tions.</P>
<P>Mr. Davis, who in the la&s;t page of his<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 284.</NOTE> Work
appears to have recollected that mode&s;ty is an
amiable and u&s;eful qualification, affirms, that
his plan required only that he &s;hould con&s;ult
the authors to whom he was directed by my
references; and that the judgment of riper
<PB N="10" REF="12">
years was not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to enable him to
execute with &s;ucce&s;s the pious labour to which
he had devoted his pen. Perhaps before we
&s;eparate, a moment to which I mo&s;t &s;ervently
a&s;pire, Mr. Davis may find that a mature judg|ment
is indi&s;pen&s;ably requi&s;ite for the &s;ucce&s;sful
execution of <HI>any</HI> work of literature, and more
e&s;pecially of critici&s;m. Perhaps he will di&s;|cover,
that a young &s;tudent who ha&s;tily con|&s;ults
an unknown author, on a &s;ubject with
which he is unacquainted, cannot always be
guided by the mo&s;t accurate reference to the
knowledge of the &s;en&s;e, as well as to the &s;ight
of the pa&s;&s;age which has been quoted by his
adver&s;ary. Abundant proofs of the&s;e maxims
will hereafter be &s;ugge&s;ted. For the pre&s;ent,
I &s;hall only remark, that it is my intention to
pur&s;ue in my defence the order, or rather
the cour&s;e, which Mr. Davis has marked out
in his Examination; and that I have num|bered
the &s;everal articles of my impeachment
according to the mo&s;t natural divi&s;ion of the
&s;ubject. And now let me proceed on this
ho&s;tile march over a dreary and barren de&s;ert,
where thir&s;t, hunger, and intolerable weari|ne&s;s,
are much more to be dreaded, than the
arrows of the enemy.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">QUOTA|TIONS IN GENERAL.</NOTE>
<P><Q REND="inline">The remarkable mode of quotation which
Mr. Gibbon adopts mu&s;t immediately &s;trike
every one who turns to his notes. He &s;ome|times
only mentions the author, perhaps the
book; and often leaves the reader the toil
of finding out, or rather gue&s;&s;ing at the pa&s;|&s;age.
The policy, however, is not without
its de&s;ign and u&s;e. By endeavouring to de|prive
us of the means of comparing him with
the authorities he cites, he flattered him&s;elf,
no doubt, that he might &s;afely have recour&s;e
to <HI>mi&s;repre&s;entation</HI><NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Davis, Preface, p. ii.</NOTE>.</Q> Such is the &s;tyle of
Mr. Davis; who in another place<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 230.</NOTE> mentions
this mode of quotation <Q REND="inline">as a good artifice to
e&s;cape detection;</Q> and applauds, with an
agreeable irony, his own labours in turning
over a <HI>few</HI> pages of the Theodo&s;ian Code.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not de&s;cend to animadvert on the rude
and illiberal &s;train of this pa&s;&s;age, and I will
frankly own that my indignation is lo&s;t in a&s;to|ni&s;hment.
The Fifteenth and Sixteenth Chap|ters
of my Hi&s;tory are illu&s;trated by three
hundred and eighty-three Notes; and the
nakedne&s;s of a few Notes, which are not ac|companied
by any quotation, is amply com|pen&s;ated
by a much greater number, which
contain two, three, or perhaps four di&s;tinct
<PB N="12" REF="14">
references; &s;o that upon the whole my &s;tock
of quotations which &s;upport and ju&s;tify my
facts cannot amount to le&s;s than eight hundred
or a thou&s;and. As I had often felt the incon|venience
of the loo&s;e and general method of
quoting which is &s;o fal&s;ely imputed to me, I
have carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed the <HI>books,</HI> the <HI>chap|ters,</HI>
the <HI>&s;ections,</HI> the <HI>pages</HI> of the authors to
whom I referred, with a degree of accuracy and
attention, which might claim &s;ome gratitude,
as it has &s;eldom been &s;o regularly practi&s;ed by
any hi&s;torical writers. And here I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s
&s;ome obligation to Mr. Davis, who, by
&s;taking my credit and his own on a circum|&s;tance
&s;o obvious and palpable, has given me
&s;o early an opportunity of &s;ubmitting the merits
of our cau&s;e, or at lea&s;t of our characters, to
he judgment of the Public. Hereafter,
when I am &s;ummoned to defend my&s;elf
again&s;t the imputation of mi&s;quoting the text,
or mi&s;repre&s;enting the &s;en&s;e of a Greek or La|tin
author, it will not be in my power to com|municate
the knowledge of the languages, or
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the books, to tho&s;e readers
who may be de&s;titute either of one or of the
other, and the part which <HI>they</HI> are obliged to
take between a&s;&s;ertions equally &s;trong and per|emptory,
may &s;ometimes be attended with
doubt and he&s;itation. But in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance,
<PB N="13" REF="15">
every reader who will give him&s;elf the
trouble of con&s;ulting the Fir&s;t Volume of my
Hi&s;tory, is a competent judge of the que&s;tion.
I exhort, I &s;olicit him to run his eye down
the coloumns of Notes, and to count <HI>how many</HI>
of the quotations are minute and particular,
<HI>how few</HI> are vague and general. When he has
&s;atisfied him&s;elf by this ea&s;y computation,
there <HI>is</HI> a word which may naturally &s;ugge&s;t it|&s;elf;
an epithet, which I &s;hould be &s;orry either
to de&s;erve or u&s;e; the boldne&s;s of Mr. Davis's
a&s;&s;ertion, and the confidence of my appeal will
tempt, nay, perhaps, will force him to apply
that epithet either to one or to the other of the
adver&s;e parties.</P>
<P>I have confe&s;&s;ed that a critical eye may di&s;|cover
<HI>&s;ome</HI> loo&s;e and general references; but as
they bear a very <HI>incon&s;iderable</HI> proportion to the
whole ma&s;s, they cannot &s;upport, or even ex|cu&s;e
a fal&s;e and ungenerous accu&s;ation, which
mu&s;t reflect di&s;honour either on the object or
on the author of it. If the examples in which
I have occa&s;ionally deviated from my ordinary
practice were &s;pecified and examined, I am
per&s;uaded that they might always be fairly attri|buted
to &s;ome one of the following rea&s;ons.
1. In &s;ome <HI>rare</HI> in&s;tances, which I have never
attempted to conceal, I have been obliged to
adopt quotations which were expre&s;&s;ed with
le&s;s accuracy than I could have wi&s;hed. 2. I
may have accidentally recollected the &s;en&s;e of a
<PB N="14" REF="16">
pa&s;&s;age which I had formerly read, without
being able to find the place, or even to tran|&s;cribe
from memory the preci&s;e words. 3. The
whole tract (as in a remarkable in&s;tance of the
&s;econd Apology of Ju&s;tin Martyr) was &s;o &s;hort,
that a more particular de&s;cription was not re|quired.
4. The form of the compo&s;ition &s;up|plied
the want of a local reference; the pre|ceding
mention of the <HI>year</HI> fixed the pa&s;&s;age of
of the annali&s;t, and the reader was guided to
the proper &s;pot in the commentaries of Grotius,
Vale&s;ius or Godefroy, by the more accurate cita|tion
of their original author. 5. The idea which
I was de&s;irous of communicating to the reader,
was &s;ometimes the general re&s;ult of the author
or treati&s;e that I had quoted; nor was it po&s;|&s;ible
to confine, within the narrow limits of a
particular reference, the &s;en&s;e or &s;pirit which
was mingled with the whole ma&s;s. The&s;e mo|tives
are either laudable or at lea&s;t innocent.
In two of the&s;e exceptions my ordinary mode
of citation was &s;uperfluous; in the other three
it was impracticable.</P>
<P>In quoting a compari&s;on which Tertullian
had u&s;ed to expre&s;s the rapid increa&s;e of the
Marcionites, I expre&s;sly declared that I was
obliged to quote it from memory<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Gibbon's Hi&s;tory, p. 551. I &s;hall u&s;ually refer to the third edition, unle&s;s there are any various readings.</NOTE> If I have
been guilty of comparing them to <HI>bees</HI> in&s;tead
of <HI>wa&s;ps,</HI> I can however mo&s;t &s;incerely di&s;claim
<PB N="15" REF="17">
the &s;agacious &s;u&s;picion of Mr. Davis<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 144.</NOTE>, who
imagines that I was tempted to amend the
&s;imile of Tertullian from an improper partiality
for tho&s;e odious Heretics.</P>
<P>A re&s;cript of Diocletian, which declared <HI>the</HI>
old law (not <HI>an</HI> old law<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 593.</NOTE>), had been alleged by
me on the re&s;pectable authority of Fra-Paolo.
The Examiner, who thinks that he has turned
over the pages of the Theodo&s;ian Code, in|forms<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 230.</NOTE> his reader that it may be found, l. vi.
tit. xxiv. leg. 8.; he will be &s;urpri&s;ed to learn
that this re&s;cript could not be <HI>found</HI> in a code
where it does not exi&s;t, but that it may di&s;tinctly
be read in the &s;ame number, the &s;ame title, and
the &s;ame book of the CODE OF JUSTINIAN. He
who is &s;evere &s;hould at lea&s;t be ju&s;t: yet I
&s;hould probably have di&s;dained this minute ani|madver&s;ion,
unle&s;s it had &s;erved to di&s;play the
general ignorance of the critic in the Hi&s;tory
of the Roman Juri&s;prudence. If Mr. Davis
had not been an ab&s;olute &s;tranger, the mo&s;t
treacherous guide could not have per&s;uaded

<NOTE PLACE="marg">ERRORS OF THE PRESE.</NOTE>
<P>Few objects are below the notice of Mr.
Davis, and his critici&s;m is never &s;o formidable
as when it is directed again&s;t the guilty cor|rector
of the pre&s;s, who on &s;ome occa&s;ions has
&s;hewn him&s;elf negligent of my fame and of his
own. Some errors have ari&s;en from the omi&s;|&s;ion
of letters; from the confu&s;ion of cyphers,
which perhaps were not very di&s;tinctly marked
in the original manu&s;cript. The <HI>two</HI> of the
Roman, and the <HI>eleven</HI> of the Arabic, numerals
have been unfortunately mi&s;taken for each
other; the &s;imilar forms of a 2 and a 3, a 5
and a 6, a 3 and a 8, have improperly been
tran&s;po&s;ed; Antolycus for Autolycus, Idolatria
for Idololatria, Hol&s;terius for Hol&s;tenius, had
e&s;caped my own ob&s;ervation, as well as
the diligence of the per&s;on who was em|ployed
to revi&s;e the &s;heets of my Hi&s;tory.
The&s;e important errors, from the indulgence
of a deluded Public, have been multiplied in
the numerous impre&s;&s;ions of three different
editions; and for the pre&s;ent I can only lament
my own defects, whil&s;t I deprecate the wrath of
Mr. Davis, who &s;eems ready to infer that I
cannot either read or write. I &s;incerely ad|mire
his patient indu&s;try, which I de&s;pair of
being able to imitate; but if a future edition
&s;hould ever be required, I could wi&s;h to ob|tain,
on any rea&s;onable terms, the &s;ervices of

<P>The nature of my &s;ubject had led me to

their fir&s;t <HI>appearance</HI> to the eyes of other na|tions;
and I cannot avoid tran&s;cribing the &s;hort
pa&s;&s;age in which I had introduced them.
<Q REND="inline">The Jews, who under the A&s;&s;yrian and Per|&s;ian

the curio&s;ity and wonder of other na|tions<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 537.</NOTE>.</Q> This &s;imple abridgment &s;eems in its
turn to have excited the wonder of Mr. Davis,
who&s;e &s;urpri&s;e almo&s;t renders him eloquent.
<Q REND="inline"><PB N="19" REF="21">What a &s;trange a&s;&s;emblage,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">is
here. It is like Milton's Chaos, without

afford us, but a deal of boyi&s;h co|louring
to the prejudice of much good hi&s;|tory<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 5.</NOTE>.</Q> If I rightly under&s;tand Mr. Davis's
language, he cen&s;ures, as a piece of confu&s;ed
declamation, the pa&s;&s;age which he has pro|duced
from my hi&s;tory; and if I collect the
angry critici&s;ms which he has &s;cattered over
twenty pages of controver&s;y<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 2&mdash;22.</NOTE>, I think I can
di&s;cover that there is hardly a period, or even
a word, in this unfortunate pa&s;&s;age, which has
obtained the approbation of the Examiner.</P>
<P>As nothing can e&s;cape his vigilance, he cen|&s;ures
me for including the twelve tribes of I&s;|rael
under the common appellation of JEWS<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 3.</NOTE>,
and for extending the name of ASSYRIANS to
the &s;ubjects of the Kings of Babylon<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 2.</NOTE>; and
again cen&s;ures me, becau&s;e &s;ome facts which
are affirmed or in&s;inuated in my text, do not
agree with the &s;trict and proper limits which he has
a&s;&s;igned to tho&s;e national denominations. The
name of <HI>Jews</HI> has indeed been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the
&s;cepter of the tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and, in the times
which precede the captivity, it is u&s;ed in the more
<PB N="20" REF="22">
general &s;en&s;e with &s;ome &s;ort of impropriety;
but &s;urely I am not peculiarly charged with a
fault which has been con&s;ecrated by the con|&s;ent
of twenty centuries, the practice of the
be&s;t writers, ancient as well as modern (&s;ee
Jo&s;ephus and Prideaux, even in the titles of
their re&s;pective works), and by the u&s;age of mo|dern
languages, of the Latin, the Greek, and,
if I may credit Reland, of the Hebrew it&s;elf
(&s;ee Pale&s;tin, l. i. c. 6.). With regard to
the other word, that of A&s;&s;yrians, mo&s;t a&s;|&s;uredly
I will not lo&s;e my&s;elf in the labyrinth
of the A&s;iatic monarchies before the age of
Cyrus; nor indeed is any more required for
my ju&s;tification, than to prove that Babylon
was con&s;idered as the capital and royal &s;eat of
A&s;&s;yria. If Mr. Davis were a man of learn|ing,
I might be moro&s;e enough to cen&s;ure his
ignorance of ancient geography, and to over|whelm
him under a load of quotations, which
might be collected and tran&s;cribed with very
little trouble: But as I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;uppo&s;e that he
has received a cla&s;&s;ical education, I might have
expected him to have read the fir&s;t book of
Herodotus, where that hi&s;torian de&s;cribes, in
the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t elegant terms, the &s;itu|ation
and greatne&s;s of Babylon: <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="21" REF="23">
(Clio, c. 178.) I may be &s;urpri&s;ed
that he &s;hould be &s;o little conver&s;ant with the
Cyropoedia of Xenophon, in the whole cour&s;e
of which the King of Babylon, the adver&s;ary
of the Medes and Per&s;ians, is repeatedly men|tioned
by the &s;tyle and title of THE ASSYRIAN, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">
(l. ii. p. 102, 103, Edit. Hutchin&s;on.) But
there remains &s;omething more: and Mr. Davis
mu&s;t apply the &s;ame reproaches of <HI>inaccuracy,</HI>
<HI>if not ignorance,</HI> to the Prophet I&s;aiah, who,
in the name of Jehovah, announcing the down|fal
of Babylon and the deliverance of I&s;rael,
declares with an oath; <Q REND="inline">And as I have pur|po&s;ed
the thing &s;hall &s;tand: to cru&s;h the
ASSYRIAN in my land, and to trample him
on my mountains. Then &s;hall his yoke de|part
from off them; and his burthen &s;hall
be removed from off their &s;houlders.</Q> (I&s;aiah,
xiv. 24, 25. Lowth's new tran&s;lation. See
likewi&s;e the Bi&s;hop's note, p. 98.)</P>
<P>The jealou&s;y which Mr. Davis affects for the
honour of the Jewi&s;h people will not &s;uffer him
to allow that they were <HI>&s;laves</HI> to the conquerors
of the Ea&s;t; and while he acknowledges that
they were tributary and dependent, he &s;eems
de&s;irous of introducing, or even inventing,
&s;ome milder expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;tate of va&s;&s;al|age
<PB N="22" REF="24">
and <HI>&s;ub&s;ervience</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Davis. p. 6.</NOTE>; from whence Tacitus a&s;|&s;umed
the words of <HI>de&s;pecti&s;&s;ima pars &s;ervientium.</HI>
Has Mr. Davis never heard of the di&s;tinction
of civil and political &s;lavery? Is he ignorant
that even the natural and victorious &s;ubjects of
an A&s;iatic de&s;pot have been de&s;ervedly marked
with the opprobrious epithet of &s;laves by every
writer acquainted with the name and advan|tage
of freedom? Does he not know that un|der
&s;uch a government, the yoke is impo&s;ed
with double weight on the necks of the van|qui&s;hed,
as the rigour of tyranny is aggra|vated
by the abu&s;e of conque&s;t. From the
fir&s;t inva&s;ion of Judaea by the arms of the A&s;|&s;yrians,
to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the Per&s;ian mo|narchy
by Alexander, there elap&s;ed a period
of above four hundred years, which included
about twelve ages or generations of the human
race. As long as the Jews a&s;&s;erted their in|dependence,
they repeatedly &s;uffered every ca|lamity
which the rage and in&s;olence of a vic|torious
enemy could inflict; the throne of David
was overturned, the temple and city were re|duced
to a&s;hes, and the whole land, a circum|&s;tance
perhaps unparalleled in hi&s;tory, remained
three-&s;core and ten years without inhabitants,
and without cultivation. (2 Chronicles, xxxvi.
21.) According to an in&s;titution which has
<PB N="23" REF="25">
long prevailed in A&s;ia, and particularly in the
Turki&s;h government, the mo&s;t beautiful and
ingenious youths were carefully educated in
the palace, where &s;uperior merit &s;ometimes
introduced the&s;e fortunate <HI>&s;laves</HI> to the favour
of the conqueror, and to the honours of the
&s;tate. (See the book and example of Daniel.)
The re&s;t of the unhappy Jews experienced the
hard&s;hips of captivity and exile in di&s;tant lands,
and while individuals were oppre&s;&s;ed, the na|tion
&s;eemed to be di&s;&s;olved or annihilated. The
gracious edict of Cyrus was offered to all tho&s;e
who wor&s;hipped the God of I&s;rael in the temple
of Jeru&s;alem; but it was accepted by no more
than forty-two thou&s;and per&s;ons of either &s;ex
and of every age, and of the&s;e about thirty
thou&s;and derived their origin from the Tribes
of Judah, of Benjamin, and of Levi. (See Ez|ra,
i. Nehemiah, vii. and Prideaux's Connec|tions,
vol. i. p. 107. fol. Edit. London, 1718.)
The incon&s;iderable band of exiles, who returned
to inhabit the land of their fathers, cannot be
computed as the hundred and fiftieth part of
the mighty people, that had been numbered by
the impious ra&s;hne&s;s of David. After a &s;ur|vey,
which did not comprehend the Tribes of
Levi and Benjamin, the Monarch was a&s;&s;ured
that he reigned over <HI>one million five hundred and
&s;eventy thou&s;and men</HI> that drew &s;word (2 Chro|nicles,
<PB N="24" REF="26">
xxi. 1&mdash;6), and the country of Judaea
mu&s;t have contained near &s;even millions of free
inhabitants. The progre&s;s of re&s;toration is
always le&s;s rapid than that of de&s;truction; Je|ru&s;alem,
which had been ruined in a few
months, was rebuilt by the &s;low and inter|rupted
labours of a whole century; and the
Jews, who gradually multiplied in their na|tive
&s;eats, enjoyed a &s;ervile and precarious ex|i&s;tence,
which depended on the capricious will
of their ma&s;ter. The books of Ezra and Ne|hemiah
do not afford a very plea&s;ing view of
their &s;ituation under the Per&s;ian Empire; and
the book of E&s;ther exhibits a mo&s;t extraordi|nary
in&s;tance of the degree of e&s;timation in
which they were held at the Court of Su&s;a. A
Mini&s;ter addre&s;&s;ed his King in the following
words, which may be con&s;idered as a Com|mentary
on the <HI>de&s;pecti&s;&s;ima pars &s;ervientium</HI> of
the Roman hi&s;torian; <Q REND="inline">And Haman &s;aid to
King Aha&s;uerus, there is a certain people
&s;cattered abroad, and di&s;per&s;ed among the
people in all the provinces of thy kingdom;
and their laws are diver&s;e from all people,
neither keep they the King's laws; therefore
it is not for the King's profit to &s;uffer them.
If it plea&s;e the King let it be written that
they may be de&s;troyed; and I will pay ten
thou&s;and talents of &s;ilver to the hands of
<PB N="25" REF="27">
tho&s;e that have the charge of the bu&s;ine&s;s to
bring it to the King's trea&s;uries. And the
King took his ring from his hand, and gave
it to Haman, the &s;on of Hammedatha the
Agagite, the Jews enemy. And the King
&s;aid unto Haman, The &s;ilver is given unto
thee: the people al&s;o, to do with them as
it &s;eemeth good to thee.</Q>  (E&s;ther, iii. 8&mdash;11.)
This trifling favour was a&s;ked by the Mini&s;ter,
and granted by the Monarch, with an ea&s;y in|difference,
which expre&s;&s;ed their contempt for
the lives and fortunes of the Jews; the bu&s;ine&s;s
pa&s;&s;ed without difficulty through the forms of
office; and had E&s;ther been le&s;s lovely, or le&s;s
beloved, a &s;ingle day would have con&s;ummated
the univer&s;al &s;laughter of a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive people,
to whom no legal defence was allowed, and
from whom no re&s;i&s;tance &s;eems to have been
dreaded. I am a &s;tanger to Mr. Davis's poli|tical
principles; but I &s;hould think that the
epithet of <HI>&s;laves,</HI> and of <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed</HI> &s;laves, may,
without inju&s;tice, be applied to a captive na|tion,
over who&s;e heads the &s;word of tyranny
was &s;u&s;pended by &s;o &s;lender a thread.</P>
<P>The policy of the Macedonians was very
different from that of the Per&s;ians; and yet
Mr. Davis, who reluctantly confe&s;&s;es that the
Jews were oppre&s;&s;ed by the former, does not
under&s;tand how long they were favoured and
<PB N="26" REF="28">
protected by the latter<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Davis. p. 4.</NOTE>. In the &s;hock of tho&s;e
revolutions which divided the empire of Alex|ander,
Judaea, like the other provinces, expe|rienced
the tran&s;ient ravages of an advancing
or retreating enemy, who led away a multitude
of captives. But in the age of Jo&s;ephus, the
Jews &s;till enjoyed the privileges granted by the
Kings of A&s;ia and Egypt, who had fixed nu|merous
colonies of that nation in the new cities
of Alexandria, Antioch, &amp;c. and placed them
in the &s;ame honourable condition (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">)
as the Greeks and Macedonians them|&s;elves.
(Jo&s;eph. Antiquat. l. xii. c. 1. 3.
p. 585. 596. Vol. i. edit. Havercamp.) Had
they been treated with le&s;s indulgence, their
&s;ettlement in tho&s;e celebrated cities, the &s;eats of
commerce and learning, was enough to introduce
them to the knowledge of the world, and to ju&s;tify
my <HI>ab&s;urd</HI> propo&s;ition, that they emerged from
ob&s;curity under the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Alexander.</P>
<P>Under the reign of tho&s;e princes who oc|cupy
the interval between Alexander and Au|gu&s;tus,
the Jews a&s;&s;erted their civil and reli|gious
rights again&s;t Antiochus Epiphanes, who
had adopted new maxims of tyranny, and the age
of the Machabees is perhaps the mo&s;t glorious
period of the Hebrew annals. Mr. Davis,
who on this occa&s;ion is bewildered by the &s;ub|tlety
of Tacitus, does not comprehend why
<PB N="27" REF="29">
the hi&s;torian &s;hould a&s;cribe the independence
of the Jews to three <HI>negative</HI> cau&s;es, <Q REND="inline">Mace|donibus
invalidis, Parthis nondum adultis,
et Romani procul aberant.</Q> To the under|&s;tanding
of the critic, Tacitus might as well
have ob&s;erved that the Jews were not de&s;troyed
by a plague, a famine, or an earthquake; and
Mr. Davis cannot &s;ee, for his own part, any
rea&s;on why they might not have elected Kings
of their own two or three hundred years be|fore<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 8.</NOTE>. Such indeed was not the rea&s;on of Ta|citus;
he probably con&s;idered that every na|tion,
depre&s;&s;ed by the weight of a foreign
power, naturally ri&s;es towards the &s;urface, as
&s;oon as the pre&s;&s;ure is removed; and he
might think that, in a &s;hort and rapid hi&s;tory
of the independence of the Jews, it was &s;uffi|cient
for him to &s;hew that the ob&s;tacles did not
exi&s;t, which, in an earlier or in a later period,
would have checked their efforts. The curi|ous
reader, who has lei&s;ure to &s;tudy the Jewi&s;h
and Syrian hi&s;tory, will di&s;cover that the
throne of the A&s;monaean Princes was con|firmed
by the two great victories of the Parthians
over Demetrius Nicator, and Antiochus Sidetes
(See Jo&s;eph. Antiquitat. Jud. l. xiii. c. 5, 6.
8, 9. Ju&s;tin, xxxvi. 1. xxxviii. 10. with U&s;her
and Prideaux, before Chri&s;t 141 and 130); and
the expre&s;&s;ion of Tacitus, the more clo&s;ely it is
examined, will be the more rationally admired.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30">
My Quotations<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 537. Note 1, 2.</NOTE> are the object of Mr. Da|vis's
critici&s;m<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 10, 11. 20.</NOTE>, as well as the Text of this &s;hort,
but obnoxious pa&s;&s;age. He corrects the error
of my memory, which had &s;ugge&s;ted <HI>&s;ervitutis</HI>
in&s;tead of <HI>&s;ervientium</HI>; and &s;o natural is the al|liance
between truth and moderation, that on
this occa&s;ion he forgets his character, and can|didly
acquits me of any malicious de&s;ign to
mi&s;repre&s;ent the words of Tacitus. The other
references, which are contained in the fir&s;t and
&s;econd Notes of my Fifteenth Chapter, are
connected with each other, and can only be
mi&s;taken after they have been forcibly &s;epa|rated.
The &s;ilence of Herodotus is a fair evi|dence
of the ob&s;curity of the Jews, who had
e&s;caped the eyes of &s;o curious a traveller. The
Jews are fir&s;t mentioned by Ju&s;tin, when he
relates the &s;iege of Jeru&s;alem by Antiochus Si|detes;
and the conque&s;t of Judaea, by the
arms of Pompey, engaged Diodorus and Dion
to introduce that &s;ingular nation to the ac|quaintance
of their readers. The&s;e epochs,
which are within &s;eventy years of each other,
mark the age in which the Jewi&s;h people,
emerging from their ob&s;curity, began to act a
part in the &s;ociety of nations, and to excite
the curio&s;ity of the Greek and Roman hi&s;to|rians.
For that purpo&s;e only, I had appealed
to the authority of Diodorus Siculus, of Ju&s;tin,
or rather of Trogus Pompeius, and of Dion
<PB N="29" REF="31">
Ca&s;&s;ius. If I had de&s;igned to inve&s;tigate the
Jewi&s;h Antiquities, rea&s;on, as well as faith,
mu&s;t have directed my inquiries to the Sacred

from that vehement writer, which excited the
horror of every humane reader, and which
even Mr. Davis will not explicitly defend, has
furni&s;hed him with a few critical cavils<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 29&mdash;33.</NOTE>.
Happy &s;hould I think my&s;elf, if the materials
of my Hi&s;tory could be always expo&s;ed to the

<PB N="31" REF="33">
my&s;elf with appealing to the impartial
Reader, whether my Ver&s;ion of this Pa&s;&s;age is
not as fair and as faithful as the more literal
tran&s;lation which Mr. Davis has exhibited in
an oppo&s;ite column. I &s;hall only ju&s;tify two
expre&s;&s;ions which have provoked his indigna|tion.
1. I had ob&s;erved that the zealous Afri|can
pur&s;ues the infernal de&s;cription in a long
variety of affected and unfeeling wittici&s;ms;
the in&s;tances of Gods, of Kings, of Magi|&s;trates,
of Philo&s;ophers, of Poets, of Trage|dians
introduced into my Tran&s;lation. Tho&s;e
which I had omitted relate to the Dancers, the
Charioteers, and the Wre&s;tlers; and it is al|mo&s;t
impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s tho&s;e conceits which
are connected with the language and manners
of the Romans. But the reader will be <HI>&s;uffi|ciently</HI>
&s;hocked, when he is informed that Ter|tullian
alludes to the improvement which the
agility of the Dancers, the <HI>red</HI> livery of the
Charioteers, and the attitudes of the Wre&s;tlers,
would derive from the effects of fire. <Q REND="inline">Tunc

non in Gymna&s;iis, &s;ed in igne jacu|lati.</Q>
2. I cannot refu&s;e to an&s;wer Mr.
Davis's very particular que&s;tion, Why I appeal
to Tertullian for the condemnation of the
wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t virtuous of the Pagans? <HI>Becau&s;e</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="34">
I am inclined to be&s;tow that epithet on Trajan
and the Antonines, Homer and Euripides,
Plato and Ari&s;totle, who are all manife&s;tly in|cluded
within the fiery de&s;cription which I had
produced.</P>
<P>I am accu&s;ed of mi&s;quoting Tertullian ad
Scapulam<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 35, 36.</NOTE>, as an evidence that Martyrdoms
were lately introduced into Africa<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 609, Note 172.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides
Tertullian, I had quoted from Ruinart (Acta
Sincera, p. 84.) the Acts of the Scyllitan Mar|tyrs;
and a very moderate knowledge of Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
Hi&s;tory would have informed Mr.
Davis, that the two authorities thus connected
e&s;tabli&s;h the propo&s;ition a&s;&s;erted in my Text.
Tertullian, in the above-mentioned Chapter,
&s;peaks of one of the Procon&s;uls of Africa, Vi|gellius
Saturninus, <Q REND="inline">qui <HI>primus hic</HI> gladium in
nos egit;</Q> the Acta Sincera repre&s;ent the
&s;ame Magi&s;trate as the Judge of the Scyllitan
Martyrs, and Ruinart, with the con&s;ent of the
be&s;t Critics, a&s;cribes their &s;ufferings to the
per&s;ecution of Severus. Was it my fault if
Mr. Davis was incapable of &s;upplying the in|termediate
ideas?</P>
<P>Is it likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould ju&s;tify
the frequent u&s;e which I have made of Tertul|lian?
His copious writings di&s;play a lively and
intere&s;ting picture of the primitive Church,
<PB N="33" REF="35">
and the &s;cantine&s;s of original materials &s;carcely
left me the liberty of choice. Yet as I was
&s;en&s;ible, that the Montani&s;m of Tertullian is
the convenient &s;creen, which our orthodox
Divines have placed before his errors, I have,
with peculiar caution, confined my&s;elf to tho&s;e
works which were compo&s;ed in the more early
and &s;ounder part of his life.</P>
<P>As a collateral ju&s;tification of my frequent
appeals to this African Pre&s;byter, I had intro|duced,
in the third edition of my Hi&s;tory, two
pa&s;&s;ages of Jerom and Prudentius, which prove
that Tertullian was the ma&s;ter of Cyprian, and
that Cyprian was the ma&s;ter of the Latin
Church<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 566. N. 72.</NOTE>. Mr. Davis a&s;&s;ures me, however,
that I &s;hould have done better not to have
<Q REND="inline">added this note<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 145.</NOTE>, as I have only accumu|lated
my inaccuracies.</Q> One inaccuracy he
had indeed detected, an error of the pre&s;s, Hie|ronym.
de Viris illu&s;tribus, c. 53 for 63; but
this advantage is dearly purcha&s;ed by Mr. Da|vis.

the original words of Cyprian, has a braver and

the Works of Jerom, mi&s;took the Ver&s;ion of

My reference to Prudentius, Hymn. xiii. 100.

believed that my critics would continue
to read till they came to a full &s;top. I &s;hall

my cau&s;e, or at lea&s;t of the innocence and fair|ne&s;s

<P>But, <Q REND="inline">if I had looked into the pa&s;&s;age, and
found that Sulpicius Severus there expre&s;sly
<PB N="36" REF="38">
tells us, that the Apocalyp&s;e was the work

Unfortunate indeed would have been my

it to be the work of an Apo&s;tle. Such
indeed was the opinion of Severus him&s;elf,

with folly or impiety for rejecting this &s;acred

<P>If the rules of grammar and of logic autho|ri&s;e,

obvious interpretation. From a fair compari|&s;on

that the former contained the <HI>greater

the controverted hi&s;tory of that famous book;
but I am called upon<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">By Mr. Davis, p. 41. and by Dr. Chel&s;um, Remarks, p. 57.</NOTE> to defend my Remark
that the Apocalyp&s;e was tacitly excluded from the
&s;acred canon by the council of Laodicea (Ca|non
LX.) To defend my Remark, I need
only &s;tate the fact in a &s;imple, but more parti|cular
manner. The a&s;&s;embled Bi&s;hops of A&s;ia,
after enumerating all the books of the Old and
New Te&s;tament which &s;hould be read in
churches, omit the Apocalyp&s;e, and the Apo|calyp&s;e
alone; at a time when it was rejected
or que&s;tioned by many pious and learned Chri&s;|tians,
who might deduce a very plau&s;ible ar|gument
from the &s;ilence of the Synod.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the Council of Trent re&s;olved to
pronounce &s;entence on the Canon of Scripture,
<PB N="38" REF="40">
the opinion which prevailed, after &s;ome debate,
was to declare the Latin Vulgate authentic and
<HI>almo&s;t</HI> infallible; and this &s;entence, which was
guarded by formidable Anathemas, &s;ecured all
the books of the Old and New Te&s;tament
which compo&s;ed that ancient ver&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">che &s;i

was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the majority of the Theologians
urged, with confidence and &s;ucce&s;s, that it was
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to receive the Vulgate as
authentic and in&s;pired, unle&s;s they wi&s;hed to
abandon the victory to the Lutherans, and the

rea&s;on as the mo&s;t powerful argument which
influenced the debates of the Council: But
Mr. Davis, jealous of the honour of a Synod

affirms that Fra-Paolo has given another
more &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on on which the&s;e Popi&s;h
Bi&s;hops built their determination, That after
dividing the books under their con&s;ideration
into three cla&s;&s;es; of tho&s;e which had been al|ways

had formerly been doubted, but which by
u&s;e and cu&s;tom had acquired canonical autho|rity;

certified; the Apocalyp&s;e was judiciou&s;ly
placed by the Fathers of the Council in the
&s;econd of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The Italian pa&s;&s;age which, for that purpo&s;e,
Mr. Davis had alleged at the bottom of his page,
is indeed taken from the text of Fra-Paolo: but

<P N="1">1. I had remarked, without any malicious in|tention,
that one of the &s;eventeen Chri&s;tians

of robbery<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 654, N. 75.</NOTE>. Mr. Davis<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 61, 62, 63.

A &s;imple narrative of this fact, in the
relation of which Mr. Davis has <HI>really</HI> &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed
&s;everal material circum&s;tances, will af|ford
the cleare&s;t ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>Eu&s;ebius had pre&s;erved an original letter
from Diony&s;ius Bi&s;hop of Alexandria to Fabius
Bi&s;hop of Antioch, in which the former re|lates
the circum&s;tances of the per&s;ecution which
had lately afflicted the capital of Egypt. He
allows a rank among the martyrs to one Ne|me&s;ion,
an Egyptian, who was fal&s;ely or ma|liciou&s;ly
accu&s;ed as a companion of robbers.
Before the Centurion he ju&s;tified him&s;elf from
<PB N="43" REF="45">
this calumny, which did not relate to him:
but being charged as a Chri&s;tian, he was
brought in chains before the Governor. That
unju&s;t magi&s;trate, after inflicting on Neme&s;ion
<HI>a double mea&s;ure of &s;tripes and tortures,</HI> gave or|ders
that he &s;hould be <HI>burnt with the robbers.</HI>
(Diony&s;. apud Eu&s;eb. l. vi. c. 41.)</P>
<P>It is evident that Diony&s;ius repre&s;ents the
religious &s;ufferer as innocent of the criminal
accu&s;ation which had been fal&s;ely brought
again&s;t him. It is not le&s;s evident, that what|ever
might be the opinion of the Centurion,
the &s;upreme magi&s;trate con&s;idered Neme&s;ion
as guilty, and that he affected to &s;hew, by the
mea&s;ure of his tortures, and by the compa|nions
of his execution, that he puni&s;hed him,
not only as a Chri&s;tian, but as a robber.
The evidence again&s;t Neme&s;ion, and that
which might be produced in his favour, are
equally lo&s;t; and the que&s;tion (which fortu|nately
is of little moment) of his guilt or in|nocence
re&s;ts &s;olely on the oppo&s;ite judgments
of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil &s;uperiors. I could
ea&s;ily perceive that both the Bi&s;hop and the
Governor were actuated by different pa&s;&s;ions
and prejudices towards the unhappy &s;ufferer;
but it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to decide which of
the two was the mo&s;t likely to indulge his pre|judices
and pa&s;&s;ions at the expence of truth.
In this doubtful &s;ituation, I conceived that
I had acted with the mo&s;t unexceptionable
<PB N="44" REF="46">
caution, when I contented my&s;elf with ob|&s;erving
that Neme&s;ion was <HI>accu&s;ed</HI>; a circum|&s;tance
of a public and authentic nature, in

<P N="2">2. Mr. Davis<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 64, 65.</NOTE> charges me with fal&s;ifying

To &s;upport this charge, he produces &s;ome part
of a chapter of Eu&s;ebius, the Engli&s;h in his

fir&s;t favoured the Chri&s;tians with a view of
popularity, yet afterwards, being addicted
to magic, and every other impiety, HE ex|erted
him&s;elf in per&s;ecuting the Chri&s;tians, in
a more &s;evere and de&s;tructive manner than
his predece&s;&s;ors had done before him.</Q></P>
<P>If it were in my power to place the volume
and chapter of Eu&s;ebius (Hi&s;t. Eccle&s;. l. viii.
c. 14.) before the eyes of every reader, I &s;hould
<PB N="45" REF="47">
be &s;atisfied and &s;ilent. I &s;hould not be under
the nece&s;&s;ity of prote&s;ting, that in the pa&s;&s;age
quoted, or rather abridged, by my adver&s;ary,
the &s;econd member of the period, which alone
contradicts my account of Maxentius, has not
the mo&s;t di&s;tant reference to that odious tyrant.
After di&s;tingui&s;hing the mild conduct which
<HI>he</HI> affected towards the Chri&s;tians, Eu&s;ebius
proceeds to animadvert with becoming &s;erverity
on the general vices of his reign; the rapes,
the murders, the oppre&s;&s;ion, the promi&s;cuous
ma&s;&s;acres, which I had faithfully related in
their proper place, and which the Chri&s;tians,
not in their religious, but in their civil capa|city,
mu&s;t occa&s;ionally have &s;hared with the
re&s;t of his unhappy &s;ubjects. The Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Hi&s;torian then makes a tran&s;ition to <HI>another
tyrant,</HI> the cruel Maximin, who carried away
from his friend and ally Maxentius the prize of
&s;uperior wickedne&s;s; for HE was addicted to
magic arts, and was a cruel per&s;ecutor of the
Chri&s;tians. The evidence of words and facts,
the plain meaning of Eu&s;ebius, the concurring
te&s;timony of Caecilius or Lactantius, and the
&s;uperfluous authority of Ver&s;ions and Commen|tators,
e&s;tabli&s;h beyond the reach of doubt or
cavil, that Maximin, and not Maxentius, is
&s;tigmatized as a per&s;ecutor, and that Mr. Davis
alone has de&s;erved the reproach of <HI>fal&s;ifying</HI> the
te&s;timony of Eu&s;ebius.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48">
Let him examine the chapter on which he

occa&s;ion of my blunder, That it was the con&s;e|quence
of my looking no farther than Dodwell

his reference. Perhaps the Hi&s;torian

<P>Mr. Davis, who talks &s;o familiarly of the

Some chronological fragments, which had &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively

corrupt and mutilated &s;tate, in the compila|tions
of Syncellus and Cedrenus. They have
<PB N="47" REF="49">
been collected, and di&s;po&s;ed by the labour and
ingenuity of Jo&s;eph Scaliger; but that proud
Critic, always ready to applaud his own &s;uc|ce&s;s,
did not flatter him&s;elf, that he had re|&s;tored
the hundredth part of the genuine Chro|nicle
of Eu&s;ebius. <Q REND="inline">Ex eo <HI>(Syncello)</HI> omnia

Latin by Jerom, with the freedom, or rather
licence, which that voluminous Author, as well

In the per&s;ecution of Aurelian, which has &s;o

the work of Eu&s;ebius from that of
Jerom, by comparing the expre&s;&s;ions of the

The former affirms, that, towards
the end of his reign, Aurelian was moved
by &s;ome councils to excite a per&s;ecution

affirm, that the following in&s;tance is the only
one that bears the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;imilitude to
what Mr. Gibbon relates as above on the
authority of Ju&s;tin. What I find in Ju&s;tin

hu&s;band, becau&s;e he is an abandoned repro|bate,
le&s;t &s;he &s;hould partake of his &s;ins. Her

his rage in this manner on one Ptolemaeus,
a teacher of Chri&s;tianity, and who had con|verted
her, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Mr. Davis then proceeds
to relate the &s;everities inflicted on Ptolemaeus,
who made a frank and in&s;tant profe&s;&s;ion of his

this.</P>
<P>His demand may be ea&s;ily &s;atisfied, and I need
only for that purpo&s;e tran&s;cribe and tran&s;late
the words of Ju&s;tin, which <HI>immediately</HI> pre|cede
the Greek quotation alleged at the bottom
of my adver&s;ary's page. I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of two

<P>In &s;tating the toleration of Chri&s;tianity du|ring
the greate&s;t part of the reign of Diocle|tian,
I had ob&s;erved<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 676. N. 133, 134.</NOTE>, that the principal eunuchs
of the palace, who&s;e names and offices were
particularly &s;pecified, enjoyed, with their wives
and children, the free exerci&s;e of the Chri&s;tian
religion. Mr. Davis twice affirms<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 75, 76.</NOTE>, in the
mo&s;t deliberate manner, that this pretended
fact, which is a&s;&s;erted on the &s;ole authority,
is contradicted by the po&s;itive evidence, of Lac|tantius.
In both the&s;e <HI>effirmations</HI> Mr. Davis
is inexcu&s;ably mi&s;taken.</P>
<P N="1">1. When the &s;torms of per&s;ecution aro&s;e, the
Prie&s;ts, who were offended by the &s;ign of the
Cro&s;s, obtained leave of the Emperor, that the
profane, the Chri&s;tians, who accompanied him
to the Temple, &s;hould be compelled to offer
&s;acrifice; and this incident is mentioned by
the Rhetorician, to whom I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent
refu&s;e the name of Lactantius. The act of
idolatry, which at the expiration of eighteen
years was required of the officers of Dioletian,
is a manife&s;t proof that their religious freedom
had hitherto been inviolate, except in the &s;ingle
in&s;tance of waiting on their ma&s;ter to the

Temple; a &s;ervice le&s;s criminal, than the pro|fane
compliance for which the Mini&s;ter of the

Prophet of I&s;rael.</P>
<P N="2">2. The reference which I made to Lac|tantius
expre&s;sly pointed out this exception to
their freedom. But the proof of the toleration
which they enjoyed, was built on a different
te&s;timony, which my di&s;ingenuous adver&s;ary has
concealed; an ancient and curious in&s;truction,
compo&s;ed by Bi&s;hop Theonas, for the u&s;e of
Lucian and the other Chri&s;tian eunuchs of the
palace of Diocletian. This authentic piece was
publi&s;hed in the Spicilegium of Dom Luc
d'Acheri; as I had not the opportunity of con|&s;ulting
the original, I was contented with quot|ing
it on the faith of Tillemont, and the refer|ence

<P N="1">1. Mr. Davis<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 11.</NOTE> had imputed to me as a

rebellion which inflamed the Jews, from the
reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 622.</NOTE>,
whil&s;t the pa&s;&s;age of that Hi&s;torian is confined
to an in&s;urrection in Cyprus and Cyrene,
which broke out within that period. The
Reader who will ca&s;t his eye on the Note
(ch. xvi. note 1.) which is &s;upported by
that quotation from Dion, will di&s;cover that it
related only to <HI>this</HI> particular fact. The ge|neral
po&s;ition, which is indeed too notorious
to require any proof, I had carefully ju&s;tified
in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame paragraph; partly by
another reference to Dion Ca&s;&s;ius, partly by an
allu&s;ion to the well-known Hi&s;tory of Jo&s;e|phus,
and partly by <HI>&s;everal</HI> quotations from the

<P N="2"><PB N="55" REF="57">
2. The pa&s;&s;age of Dion, which I am accu&s;ed
of endeavouring to conceal, might perhaps
have remained invi&s;ible, even to the piercing
eye of Mr. Davis, if <HI>I</HI> had not carefully re|ported
it in its proper place: and it was in
my power to report it, without being guilty of
any <HI>incon&s;iderate contradiction.</HI> I had ob&s;erved,
that, in the large hi&s;tory of Dion Ca&s;&s;ius, Xi|philin
had not been able to di&s;cover the name

in which Marcia, the favourite Concubine of
Commodus, is celebrated as the Patrone&s;s of
the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> Mr. Davis has tran&s;cribed my
quotation, but <HI>he</HI> has concealed the important
words which I now di&s;tingui&s;h by Italics (ch.
xvi. note 106. Dion Ca&s;&s;ius, <HI>or rather his ab|breviator
Xiphilin,</HI> l. lxxii. p. 1206.) The re|ference
is fairly made and cautiou&s;ly qualified;
I am already &s;ecure from the imputations of
fraud or incon&s;i&s;tency; and the opinion which
attributes the la&s;t-mentioned pa&s;&s;age to the Ab|breviator,
rather than to the original Hi&s;torian,
may be &s;upported by the mo&s;t unexception|able
authorities. I &s;hall protect my&s;elf by the&s;e
of Reimar (in his Edition of Dion Ca&s;&s;ius,
tom. ii. p. 1207. note 34.), and of Dr. Lard|ner;

latter, in his Collection of Jewi&s;h and Heathen

<P><Q REND="inline">This paragraph I rather think to be Xi|philin's
than Dion's. The &s;tyle at lea&s;t is

or <HI>Judai&s;m</HI>; but never u&s;eth the word <HI>Chri&s;|tians.</HI>
Another thing that may make us
doubt whether this ob&s;ervation be entirely
Dion's, is the phra&s;e, "it is related (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">)."
For at the beginning of the reign
of Commodus, he &s;ays, "The&s;e things,

any adulteration.</Q> For my own part,
I mu&s;t, in my private opinion, a&s;cribe even
the &s;en&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age to Xiphilin. The
<HI>Monk</HI> might eagerly collect and in&s;ert an anec|dote
which related to the dome&s;tic hi&s;tory of the

have appeared an object of very little moment

<P>I almo&s;t he&s;itate whether I &s;hould take any

Smyrnaeans, which I cited according to the

the Apo&s;tolical Fathers, publi&s;hed at Am&s;ter|dam,
1724, in two volumes in folio. The

<Q REND="inline">I have known, and I believe, that after his

he &s;aid unto them, Take, handle me, and
&s;ee that I am not an incorporeal daemon or

The faith of the Apo&s;tles confuted the
impious error of the Gno&s;tics, which attributed
only the <HI>appearances</HI> of a human body to the
Son of God: and it was the great object of
Ignatius, in the la&s;t moments of his life, to
&s;ecure the Chri&s;tians of A&s;ia from the &s;nares of
tho&s;e dangerous Heretics. According to the
tradition of the modern Greeks, Ignatius was
the child whom Je&s;us received into his arms
(See Tillemont Mem. Eccle&s;. tom. ii. part ii.
p. 43.); yet as he could hardly be old enough
to remember the re&s;urrection of the Son of
God, he mu&s;t have derived his knowledge
<HI>either</HI> from our pre&s;ent Evangeli&s;ts, <HI>or</HI> from
&s;ome Apocryphal Go&s;pel, <HI>or</HI> from &s;ome un|written
tradition.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="62" REF="64">
1. The Go&s;pels of St. Luke and St. John
would undoubtedly have &s;upplied Ignatius with
the mo&s;t invincible proofs of the reality of the
body of Chri&s;t, when he appeared to the
Apo&s;tles after his re&s;urrection: but neither of
tho&s;e Go&s;pels contain the characteri&s;tic words
of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, and the important cir|cum&s;tance
that either Peter, or <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who were
with Peter, touched the body of Chri&s;t and
believed. Had the Saint de&s;igned to quote
the Evangeli&s;t on a very nice &s;ubject of contro|ver&s;y,
he would not &s;urely have expo&s;ed him|&s;elf
by an inaccurate, or rather by a fal&s;e re|ference,
to the ju&s;t reproaches of the Gno&s;tics.
On this occa&s;ion, therefore, Ignatius did not
employ, as he might have done, again&s;t the
Heretics, the certain te&s;timony of the Evan|geli&s;ts.</P>
<P N="2">2. Jerom, who cites this remarkable pa&s;&s;age
from the Epi&s;tle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans
(See Catalog. Script. Eccle&s;. in Ignatio, tom. i.

that it was taken from the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> which he him|&s;elf
had lately tran&s;lated: and <HI>this,</HI> from the
compari&s;on of two other pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;ame

to have been the Hebrew Go&s;pel, which

Jerom mentions another Copy of this Hebrew

which was extant in the library formed at Cae|&s;area,

(Hi&s;t. Eccle&s;. l. iii. c. 36.), that <HI>he</HI> is ignorant

<P>The learning and judgment of Mo&s;heim
had been of frequent u&s;e in the cour&s;e of my

in proper expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude. My vexa|tious
Adver&s;ary is always ready to &s;tart from
his ambu&s;cade, and to hara&s;s my march by a
mode of attack, which cannot ea&s;ily be recon|ciled
with the laws of honourable war. The
greate&s;t part of the Mi&s;repre&s;entations of Mo|&s;hiem,
which Mr. Davis has imputed to me<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 95&mdash;97. 104&mdash;107. 114&mdash;132.</NOTE>,
are of &s;uch a nature, that I mu&s;t indeed be
humble, if I could per&s;uade my&s;elf to be&s;tow a
moment of &s;erious attention on them. <HI>Whether</HI>
Mo&s;heim could prove that an ab&s;olute com|munity
of goods was not e&s;tabli&s;hed among the
fir&s;t Chri&s;tians of Jeru&s;alem; <HI>whether</HI> he &s;u&s;|pected
the purity of the Epi&s;tles of Ignatius;
<HI>whether</HI> he cen&s;ured Dr. Middleton with tem|per

<HI>whether</HI> he corroborates the <HI>whole</HI> of my de|&s;cription
of the prophetic office; <HI>whether</HI> he
&s;peaks with approbation of the humanity
of Pliny, and <HI>whether</HI> he attributed the
&s;ame &s;en&s;e to the <HI>malefica</HI> of Suetonius, and
the <HI>exitiabilis</HI> of Tacitus. The&s;e que&s;tions,
<PB N="65" REF="67">
even as Mr. Davis has &s;tated them, lie open
to the judgment of every reader, and the &s;uper|fluous
ob&s;ervations which I could make, would
be an abu&s;e of their time and of my own. As
little &s;hall I think of con&s;uming their patience,
by examining whether Le Clerc and Mo&s;heim
<HI>labour</HI> in the interpretation of &s;ome texts of the
Fathers, and particularly of a pa&s;&s;age of Ire|naeus,
which &s;eem to favour the preten&s;ions of
the Roman Bi&s;hop. The material part of the
pa&s;&s;age of Irenaeus con&s;i&s;ts of about <HI>four lines</HI>;
and in order to &s;hew that the interpretations of
Le Clerc and Mo&s;heim are not <HI>laboured,</HI> Mr.
Davis abridges them as much as po&s;&s;ible in the
&s;pace of <HI>twelve pages.</HI> I know not whether the
peru&s;al of my Hi&s;tory will ju&s;tify the &s;u&s;picion
of Mr. Davis, that I am &s;ecretly inclined to
the intere&s;t of the Pope: but I cannot di&s;cover
how the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e can be affected, if Ire|naeus
in the &s;econd, or Palavicini in the &s;even|teenth
century, were tempted, by any private
views, to countenance in their writings the
&s;y&s;tem of eccle&s;ia&s;tical dominion, which has been
pur&s;ued in every age by the a&s;piring Bi&s;hops of
the Imperial city. Their conduct followed the
revolutions of the Chri&s;tian Republic, but the
&s;ame &s;pirit animated the haughty brea&s;ts of
Victor the Fir&s;t, and of Paul the Fifth.</P>
<P>There &s;till remain one or two of the&s;e im|puted
Mi&s;repre&s;entations, which appear, and
<PB N="66" REF="68">
indeed only appear, to merit a little more at|tention.
In &s;tating the opinion of Mo&s;heim
with regard to the progre&s;s of the Go&s;pel, Mr.
Davis boldly declares, <Q REND="inline">that I have <HI>altered the
truth</HI> of Mo&s;heim's hi&s;tory, that I might
have an opportunity of contradicting the be|lief
and wi&s;hes of the Fathers<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 127.</NOTE>.</Q> In other
words, I have been guilty of uttering a mali|cious
fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>I had endeavoured to mitigate the &s;anguine
expre&s;&s;ion of the Fathers of the &s;econd century,
who had too ha&s;tily diffu&s;ed the light of Chri&s;ti|anity
over every part of the globe, by ob|&s;erving,
as an undoubted fact, <Q REND="inline">that the Bar|barians
of Scythia and Germany, who &s;ub|verted
the Roman Monarchy, were involved
in the errors of Pagani&s;m; and that even
the conque&s;t of Iberia, of Armenia, or of
Aethiopia, was not attempted with any de|gree
of &s;ucce&s;s, till the &s;cepter was in the
hands of an orthodox Emperor<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 611, 612.</NOTE>.</Q> I had
referred the curious reader to the fourth cen|tury
of Mo&s;heim's General Hi&s;tory of the
Church: Now Mr. Davis has di&s;covered, and
can prove, from that excellent work, <Q REND="inline">that
Chri&s;tianity, not long after its fir&s;t ri&s;e, had
been introduced into the le&s;s as well as
greater Armenia; that part of the Goths,
<PB N="67" REF="69">
who inhabited Thracia, Mae&s;ia, and Dacia,
had received the Chri&s;tian religion long be|fore
this century; and that Theophilus, their
Bi&s;hop, was pre&s;ent at the Council of
Nice<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 126, 127.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, the reference was made to
a popular work of Mo&s;heim, for the &s;atisfac|tion
of the reader, that he might obtain the ge|neral
view of the progre&s;s of Chri&s;tianity in the
fourth century, which I had gradually acquired
by &s;tudying with &s;ome care the Eccle&s;ia&s;tic
Antiquities of the Nations beyond the limits of
the Roman Empire. If I had rea&s;onably &s;up|po&s;ed
that the re&s;ult of our common inquiries
mu&s;t be the &s;ame, &s;hould I have de&s;erved a
very har&s;h cen&s;ure for my un&s;u&s;pecting confi|dence?
Or if I had declined the invidious ta&s;k
of &s;eparating a few immaterial errors, from a
ju&s;t and judicious repre&s;entation, might not
my re&s;pect for the name and merit of Mo&s;heim,
have claimed &s;ome indulgence? But I di&s;dain
tho&s;e excu&s;es, which only a candid adver&s;ary
would allow. I can meet Mr. Davis on the
hard ground of controver&s;y, and retort on his
own head the charge of concealing a part of the
truth. He him&s;elf has dared to &s;uppre&s;s the
words of my text, which immediately followed
his quotation. <Q REND="inline">Before that time the various
<PB N="68" REF="70">
accidents of war and commerce might indeed
diffu&s;e an imperfect knowledge of the Go&s;pel
among the tribes of Caledonia, and among
the borderers of the Rhine, the Danube,
and the Euphrates;</Q> and Mr. Davis has
likewi&s;e &s;uppre&s;ed one of the ju&s;tificatory Notes
on this pa&s;&s;age, which expre&s;sly points out the
time and circum&s;tances of the fir&s;t Gothic con|ver&s;ions.
The&s;e exceptions, which I had cau|tiou&s;ly
in&s;erted, and Mr. Davis has cautiou&s;ly
concealed, are &s;uperfluous for the provinces of
Thrace, Mae&s;ia, and the Le&s;&s;er Armenia, which
were contained within the precincts of the Ro|man
Empire. They allow an ample &s;cope for
the more early conver&s;ion of &s;ome independent
di&s;tricts of Dacia and the Greater Armenia,
which bordered on the Danube and Euphrates;
and the entire &s;en&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age, which Mr.
Davis fir&s;t mutilates and then attacks, is per|fectly
con&s;i&s;tent with the original text of the
learned Mo&s;heim.</P>
<P>And yet I will fairly confe&s;s, that after a
nicer inquiry into the epoch of the Armenian
Church, I am not &s;atisfied with the accuracy of
my own expre&s;&s;ion. The a&s;&s;urance that the
fir&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and the fir&s;t Archbi&s;hop,
Tiridates, and St. Gregory the Illuminator,
were &s;till alive &s;everal years after the death of
Con&s;tantine, inclined me to believe, that the
conver&s;ion of Armenia was po&s;terior to the au|&s;picious
<PB N="69" REF="71">
Revolution, which had given the &s;cep|ter
of Rome to the hands of an orthodox Em|peror.
But I had not enough con&s;idered the
two following circum&s;tances. 1. I might have
recollected the dates a&s;&s;igned by Mo&s;es of Cho|rene,
who, on this occa&s;ion, may be regarded
as a competent witne&s;s. Tiridates a&s;cended
the throne of Armenia in the third year of Dio|cletian
(Hi&s;t. Armeniae, l. ii. c. 79. p. 207.),
and St. Gregory, who was inve&s;ted with the
Epi&s;copal character in the &s;eventeenth year of
Tiridates, governed almo&s;t thirty years the
Church of Armenia, and di&s;appeared from the
world in the forty-&s;ixth year of the reign of the
&s;ame Prince. (Hi&s;t. Armeniae, l. ii. c. 88.
p. 224, 225.) The con&s;ecration of St. Gre|gory
mu&s;t therefore be placed A. D. 303, and
the conver&s;ion of the King and kingdom was
&s;oon atchieved by that &s;ucce&s;sful mi&s;&s;ionary.
2. The unju&s;t and inglorious war which Maxi|min
undertook again&s;t the Armenians, the an|cient
faithful allies of the Republic, was evi|dently
derived from a motive of &s;uper&s;titious
zeal. The hi&s;torian Eu&s;ebius (Hi&s;t. Eccle&s;.
l. ix. c. 8. p. 448. edit. Cantab.) con&s;iders the
pious Armenians as a nation of Chri&s;tians, who
bravely defended them&s;elves from the ho&s;tile
oppre&s;&s;ion of an idolatrous tyrant. In&s;tead of
maintaining <Q REND="inline">that the conver&s;ion of Armenia
was not attempted with any degree of &s;ucce&s;s
<PB N="70" REF="72">
till the &s;cepter was in the hands of an ortho|dox
Emperor,</Q> I ought to have ob&s;erved,
that the &s;eeds of the faith were deeply &s;own
during the &s;ea&s;on of the la&s;t and greate&s;t per&s;e|cution,
that many Roman exiles might a&s;&s;i&s;t
the labours of Gregory, and that the renowned
Tiridates, the hero of the Ea&s;t, may di&s;pute
with Con&s;tantine the honour of being the fir&s;t
Sovereign who embraced the Chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P>In a future edition, I &s;hall rectify an expre&s;|&s;ion
which, in &s;trictne&s;s, can only be applied to
the kingdoms of Iberia and Aethiopia. Had
the error been expo&s;ed by Mr. Davis him&s;elf, I
&s;hould not have been a&s;hamed to correct it;
but <HI>I am</HI> a&s;hamed at being reduced to contend
with an adver&s;ary who is unable to di&s;cover, or
to improve his own advantages.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting any inquiry from
whence the public might have gained in&s;truc|tion,
and him&s;elf credit, Mr. Davis chu&s;es to
perplex his readers with &s;ome angry cavils
about the progre&s;s of the Go&s;pel in the &s;econd
century. What does he mean to e&s;tabli&s;h or to
refute? Have I denied, that before the end of
that period Chri&s;tianity was very widely diffu&s;ed
both in the Ea&s;t and in the We&s;t? Has not
Ju&s;tin Martyr affirmed, without exception or
limitation, that it was already preached to
<HI>every</HI> nation on the face of the earth? Is that
propo&s;ition true at pre&s;ent? Could it be true in
<PB N="71" REF="73">
the time of Ju&s;tin? Does not Mo&s;heim acknow|ledge
the exaggeration? <Q REND="inline">Demus, nec enim

<P>The high e&s;teem which Mr. Davis expre&s;&s;es
for the writings of Mo&s;heim, would alone con|vince
how little he has read them, &s;ince he
mu&s;t have been perpetually offended and di&s;|gu&s;ted
by a train of thinking, the mo&s;t repug|nant
to his own. His jealou&s;y, however, for
the honour of Mo&s;heim, provokes him to ar|raign

that my &s;tyle, which on this occa&s;ion was more

<P>The a&s;&s;ertion of Mo&s;heim, which did not
&s;eem to be ju&s;tified<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 676, Note 132.</NOTE> by the authority of Lac|tantius,
was, that the wi&s;e and daughter of Di|ocletian,
Pri&s;ca and <HI>Valeria,</HI> had been pri|vately
<HI>baptized.</HI> Mr. Davis is &s;ure that the
words of Mo&s;heim, <Q REND="inline">Chri&s;tianis &s;acris clam

of bapti&s;m; and he is equally &s;ure, that the re|ference
to Mo&s;heim does not lead us to di&s;|cover
even the name of Valeria. In both
the&s;e a&s;&s;urances he is gro&s;sly mi&s;taken; but it
is the misfortune of controver&s;y, that an error
may be committed in three or four words,
which cannot be rectified in le&s;s than thirty or
forty lines.</P>
<P N="1">1. The true and the &s;ole meaning of the
Chri&s;tian initiation, one of the familiar and fa|vourite

<P N="2">2. But Mr. Davis cannot di&s;cover in the

words of a reference, without giving him&s;elf
the trouble of going to the end of the page or

<P>As I could not readily procure the works of

and indefatigable Tillemont, a pa&s;&s;age in
the Life of Gregory Thaumaturgus, or the
Wonder-worker, which affirmed that when the
Saint took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Epi&s;copal See, he
found only SEVENTEEN <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in the city of

(Mem. Eccle&s;. Tom. iv. p. 677. 691. Edit.

my obligation, appeared &s;ynonymous to the
word <HI>Dioce&s;e,</HI> the whole territory intru&s;ted to
the pa&s;toral care of the Wonder-worker, and
I added the epithet of <HI>exten&s;ive</HI>; becau&s;e I was
appri&s;ed that Neo-Cae&s;area was the capital of
the Polemoniac Pontus, and that the whole
kingdom of Pontus, which &s;tretched above
five hundred miles along the coa&s;t of the Eux|ine,
was divided between &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen
Bi&s;hops. (See the Georgraphia Eccle&s;ia&s;tica of
Charles de St. Paul, and Lucas Ho&s;tenius,
p. 249, 250, 251.) Thus far I may not be
thought to have de&s;erved any cen&s;ure; but the
omi&s;&s;ion of the &s;ub&s;equent part of the &s;ame
pa&s;&s;age, which imports that at his death the
Wonder-worker left no more than <HI>&s;eventeen
Pagans,</HI> may &s;eem to wear a partial and &s;u&s;pi|cious
a&s;pect.</P>
<P>Let me therefore fir&s;t ob&s;erve, as &s;ome evi|dence
of an impartial di&s;po&s;ition, that I <HI>ea&s;ily</HI>
admitted, as the cool ob&s;ervation of the philo|&s;ophic
Lucian, the angry and intere&s;ted com|plaint
of the fal&s;e prophet Alexander, that
Pontus was filled with Chri&s;tians. This com|plaint
was made under the reigns of Marcus or
of Commodus, with whom the impo&s;tor &s;o
admirably expo&s;ed by Lucian was contempo|rary:
and I had contented my&s;elf with remark|ing
that the numbers of Chri&s;tians mu&s;t have
<PB N="77" REF="79">
been very unequally di&s;tributed in the &s;everal
parts of Pontus, &s;ince the dioce&s;e of Neo-Cae|&s;area
contained, above &s;ixty years afterwards,
only &s;eventeen Chri&s;tians. Such was the in|con&s;iderable
flock which Gregory began to feed
about the year two hundred and forty, and the
real or fabulous conver&s;ions a&s;cribed by that

<Q REND="inline">I appeal to my reader, Whether this
anachroni&s;m does not plainly prove that
our Hi&s;torian never looked into Pagi's
Chronology, though he has not he&s;itated to
make a pompous reference to him in his
note<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Davis, p. 140.</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P>I cannot help ob&s;erving, that either Mr.
Davis's Dictionary is extremely confined, or
that in his Philo&s;ophy all &s;ins are of equal
magnitude. Every error of fact or language,
every in&s;tance where he does not know to re|concile
the original and the reference, he ex|pre&s;&s;es
by the gentle word of mi&s;repre&s;entation.
An inaccurate appeal to the &s;entiment of Pagi,
on a &s;ubject where I mu&s;t have been perfectly
di&s;intere&s;ted, might have been &s;tyled a lap&s;e of
memory, in&s;tead of being cen&s;ured as the effect of
vanity and ignorance. Pagi is neither a difficult
nor an uncommon writer, nor could I hope to
derive much additional fame from a <HI>pompous</HI>
quotation of his writings which I had never &s;een.</P>
<P>The words employed by Mr. Davis, of <HI>fact,</HI>
of <HI>record,</HI> of <HI>anachroni&s;m,</HI> are un&s;kilfully cho|&s;en,
and &s;o unhappily applied, as to betray a
very &s;hameful ignorance, either of the Engli&s;h
language, or of the nature of this Chronologi|cal
Que&s;tion. The date of Pliny's govern|ment
of Bithynia is not a fact recorded by any
ancient writer, but an opinion which modern
<PB N="79" REF="81">
critics have variou&s;ly formed, from the con&s;i|deration
of pre&s;umptive and collateral evidence.
Cardinal Baronius placed the con&s;ul&s;hip of
Pliny one year too late; and, as he was per|&s;uaded
the old practice of th republic &s;till
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted, he naturally &s;uppo&s;ed that Pliny
obtained his province immediately after the
expiration of his con&s;ul&s;hip. He therefore
&s;ends him into Bithynia in the year which,
according to his erroneous computation, co|incided
with the year one hundred and four,
(Baron. Annal. Eccle&s;. A. D. 103. N^o 1.
104. N^o 1), or, according to the true chro|nology,
with the year one hundred and
two, of the Chri&s;tian Aera. This mi&s;take of
Baronius, Pagi, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his
friend Cardinal Noris, undertakes to correct.
From an accurate parallel of the Annals of
Trajan and the Epi&s;tles of Pliny, he deduces
his proofs that Pliny remained at Rome &s;everal
years after his Con&s;ul&s;hip: by his own inge|nious,
though &s;ometimes fanciful theory, of
the imperial Quinquennalia, &amp;c. Pagi at la&s;t
di&s;covers that Pliny made his entrance into
Bithynia in the year one hundred and ten.
<Q REND="inline">Plinius igitur anno Chri&s;ti CENTESIMO DE|CIMO
Bithyniam intravit.</Q> Pagi, tom. i.
p. 100.</P>
<P>I will be more indulgent to my adver&s;ary
than he has been to me. I will admit, that he
<PB N="80" REF="82">
has <HI>looked into Pagi</HI>; but I mu&s;t add, that he
has only looked into that accurate Chronologer.
To rectify the errors, which, in the cour&s;e of a
laborious and original work, had e&s;caped the
diligence of the Cardinal, was the arduous ta&s;k
which Pagi propo&s;ed to execute: and for the
&s;ake of per&s;picuity, he di&s;tributes his critici&s;ms
according to the particular dates, whether ju&s;t
or faulty, of the Chronology of Baronius him|&s;elf.
Under the year 102, Mr. Davis con|fu&s;edly
&s;aw a long argument about Pliny and
Bithynia, and without conde&s;cending to read
the Author whom he <HI>pompou&s;ly</HI> quotes, this
ha&s;ty Critic imputes to him the opinion which
he had &s;o laboriou&s;ly de&s;troyed.</P>

fallen dead and lifele&s;s to the ground: they

for a moment could perplex the ignorant, or

Mr. Davis has produced as the evidence of my
&s;hameful <HI>plagiari&s;ms,</HI> may be &s;et in its true
light by three or four &s;hort and general reflex|ions.</P>
<P N="1">I. Mr. Davis has di&s;po&s;ed, in two columns,
the pa&s;&s;ages which he thinks proper to &s;elect
from my Two la&s;t Chapters, and the corre|&s;ponding
pa&s;&s;ages from Middleton, Barbeyrac,
Beau&s;obre, Dodwell, &amp;c. to the mo&s;t import|ant
of which he had been regularly guided by
my own quotations. According to the opi|nion
which he has conceived of literary pro|perty,
to <HI>agree</HI> is to <HI>follow,</HI> and to <HI>follow</HI> is to
<HI>&s;teal.</HI> He celebrates his own &s;agacity with loud

the pa&s;&s;ages which Mr. Gibbon has
purloined, <HI>he</HI> would appear as naked as the
proud and gaudy Daw in the Fable, when
each bird had plucked away its own plumes.
In&s;tead of being angry with Mr. Davis for the
parallel which he has extended to &s;o great a
<PB N="82" REF="84">
length, I am under &s;ome obligation to his
indu&s;try for the copious proofs which he has
furni&s;hed the reader, that my repre&s;entation of
&s;ome of the mo&s;t important facts of Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
Antiquity, is &s;upported by the authority or
opinion of the mo&s;t ingenious and learned of
the modern writers. The Public may not,
perhaps, be very eager to a&s;&s;i&s;t Mr. Davis in
his favourite amu&s;ement of <HI>depluming</HI> me.
They may think that if the materials which
compo&s;e my Two la&s;t Chapters are curious and
valuable, it is of little moment to whom they
properly belong. If my readers are &s;atisfied
with the form, the colours, the new arrangement
which I have given to the labours of my pre|dece&s;&s;ors,
they may perhaps con&s;ider me not
as a contemptible Thief, but as an hone&s;t and
indu&s;trious Manufacturer, who has fairly pro|cured
the raw materials, and worked them up
with a laudable degree of &s;kill and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">II. About two hundred years ago, the Court
of Rome di&s;covered that the &s;y&s;tem which had
been erected by ignorance mu&s;t be defended
and countenanced by the aid, or at lea&s;t by the
abu&s;e, of &s;cience. The gro&s;&s;er legends of the
middle ages were abandoned to contempt, but
the &s;upremacy and infallibility of two hundred
Popes, the virtues of many thou&s;and Saints,
and the miracles which they either performed
<PB N="83" REF="85">
or related, have been laboriou&s;ly con&s;ecrated
in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Annals of Cardinal Baro|nius.
A Theological Barometer might be
formed, of which the Cardinal and our coun|tryman
Dr. Middleton &s;hould con&s;titute the
oppo&s;ite and remote extremities, as the former
&s;unk to the lowe&s;t degree of credulity, which
was compatible with learning, and the latter
ro&s;e to the highe&s;t pitch of &s;ceptici&s;m, in any
wi&s;e con&s;i&s;tent with Religion. The interme|diate
gradations would be filled by a line of
eccle&s;ia&s;tical critics, who&s;e rank has been fixed
by the circum&s;tances of their temper and &s;tu|dies,
as well as by the &s;pirit of the church or
&s;ociety to which they were attached. It would
be amu&s;ing enough to calculate the weight of
prejudice in the air of Rome, of Oxford, of
Paris, and of Holland; and &s;ometimes to ob|&s;erve
the irregular tendency of Papi&s;ts towards
freedom, &s;ometimes to remark the unnatural
gravitation of Prote&s;tants towards &s;lavery. But
it is u&s;eful to borrow the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;o many
learned and ingenious men, who have viewed
the fir&s;t ages of the Church in every light, and
from every &s;ituation. If we &s;kilfully combine
the pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices, the ho&s;tile motives
and intentions, of the &s;everal theologians, we
may frequently extract knowledge from cre|dulity,
moderation from zeal, and impartial
<PB N="84" REF="86">
truth from the mo&s;t di&s;ingenuous controver&s;y.
It is the right, it is the duty of a critical hi&s;to|rian
to collect, to weigh, to &s;elect the opinions
of his predece&s;&s;ors; and the more diligence he
has exerted in the &s;earch, the more rationally
he may hope to add &s;ome improvement to the
&s;tock of knowledge, the u&s;e of which has been
common to all.</P>
<P N="3">III. Be&s;ides the ideas which may be &s;ug|ge&s;ted
by the &s;tudy of the mo&s;t learned and
ingenious of the moderns, the hi&s;torian may
be indebted to them for the occa&s;ional com|munication
of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the ancients,
which might otherwi&s;e have e&s;caped his know|ledge
or his memory. In the con&s;ideration of
any exten&s;ive &s;ubject, none will pretend to have
read all that has been written, or to recollect
all that they have read: nor is there any di&s;|grace
in recurring to the writers who have pro|fe&s;&s;edly
treated any que&s;tions, which in the
cour&s;e of a long narrative we are called upon
to mention in a &s;light and incidental manner.
If I touch upon the ob&s;cure and fanciful theo|logy
of the Gno&s;tics, I can accept without a
blu&s;h the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the candid Beau&s;obre;
and when, amid&s;t the fury of contending par|ties,
I trace the progre&s;s of eccle&s;ia&s;tical domi|nion,
I am not a&s;hamed to confe&s;s my&s;elf the
grateful di&s;ciple of the impartial Mo&s;heim.
<PB N="85" REF="87">
In the next Volume of my Hi&s;tory, the Reader
and the Critic mu&s;t prepare them&s;elves to &s;ee
me make a &s;till more liberal u&s;e of the labours
of tho&s;e indefatigable workmen who have dug
deep into the mine of antiquity. The Fathers
of the fourth and fifth centuries are far more
voluminous than their predece&s;&s;ors; the writings
of Jerom, of Augu&s;tin, of Chry&s;o&s;tom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
cover the walls of our libraries. The &s;malle&s;t
part is of the hi&s;torical kind: yet the treati&s;es
which &s;eem the lea&s;t to invite the curio&s;ity of the
reader, frequently conceal very u&s;eful hints, or
very valuable facts. The polemic who in|volves
him&s;elf and his antagoni&s;ts in a cloud of
argumentation, &s;ometimes relates the origin
and progre&s;s of the here&s;y which he confutes;
and the preacher who declaims again&s;t the
luxury, de&s;cribes the manners, of the age;
and &s;ea&s;onably introduces the mention of &s;ome
public calamity, that he may a&s;cribe it to the
ju&s;tice of offended Heaven. It would &s;urely
be unrea&s;onable to expect that the hi&s;torian
&s;hould peru&s;e enormous volumes, with the un|certain
hope of extracting a few intere&s;ting lines,
or that he &s;hould &s;acrifice whole days to the
momentary amu&s;ement of his Reader. For|tunately
for us both, the diligence of eccle&s;i|&s;ia&s;tical
critics has facilitated our inquiries: the
compilations of Tillemont might alone be con|&s;idered
<PB N="86" REF="88">
as an immen&s;e repertory of truth and
fable, of almo&s;t all that the Fathers have pre|&s;erved,
or invented, or believed; and if we
equally avail our&s;elves of the labours of con|tending
&s;ectaries, we &s;hall often di&s;cover, that
the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ages which the prudence of one of
the di&s;putants would have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed or di&s;|gui&s;ed,
are placed in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous
light by the active and intere&s;ted zeal of his
adver&s;ary. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, what is the
duty of a faithful hi&s;torian, who derives from
&s;ome modern writer the knowledge of &s;ome
ancient te&s;timony, which he is de&s;irous of in|troducing
into his own narrative? It is his
duty, and it has been my invariable practice,
to con&s;ult the original; to &s;tudy with attention
the words, the de&s;ign, the &s;pirit, the context,
the &s;ituation of the pa&s;&s;age to which I had
been referred; and before I appropriated it to
my own u&s;e, to ju&s;tify my own declaration,
<Q REND="inline">that I had carefully examined all the origi|nal
materials that could illu&s;trate the &s;ubject
which I had undertaken to treat.</Q> If this
important obligation has &s;ometimes been im|perfectly
fulfilled, I have only omitted what it
would have been impracticable for me to per|form.
The greate&s;t city in the world is &s;till
de&s;titute of that u&s;eful in&s;titution, a public li|brary;
and the writer who has undertaken to
<PB N="87" REF="89">
treat any large hi&s;torical &s;ubject, is reduced to
the nece&s;&s;ity of purcha&s;ing, for his private u&s;e,
a numerous and valuable collection of the books

an accidental quotation of ten lines, he
&s;hould load him&s;elf with a u&s;ele&s;s and expen|&s;ive
&s;eries of ten volumes. In a very few in|&s;tances,
where I had not the opportunity of

animadverting on the decency of the&s;e expre&s;|&s;ions,

&s;hall content my&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that as I
had frequently quoted Eu&s;ebius, or Cyprian,

this in&s;tance, I only made my reference to Til|lemont,

po&s;&s;e&s;s, the works of Athana&s;ius. The pro|gre&s;s
of my undertaking has &s;ince directed me
to peru&s;e the Hi&s;torical Apologies of the Arch|bi&s;hop
of Alexandria, who&s;e life is a very in|tere&s;ting
part of the age in which he lived;
and if Mr. Davis &s;hould have the curio&s;ity to
look into my Second Volume, he will find that
I make a free and frequent appeal to the writ|ings

pre&s;ented, there intervened a dark and doubt|ful
period of four&s;core years; and, even if the
Epi&s;tles of Ignatius &s;hould be approved by the
<PB N="89" REF="91">
critic, they could not be very &s;erviceable to
the hi&s;torian. From the middle of the &s;econd
to the beginning of the fourth century, we
gain our knowledge of the &s;tate and progre&s;s
of Chri&s;tianity from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Apologies
which were occa&s;ionally compo&s;ed by Ju&s;tin,
Athenagoras, Tertullian, Origen, <HI>&amp;c</HI>; from
the Epi&s;tles of Cyprian; from a few <HI>&s;incere</HI> acts
of the Martyrs; from &s;ome moral or contro|ver&s;ial
tracts, which indirectly explain the events
and manners of the times; from the rare and
accidental notice which profane writers have
taken of the Chri&s;tian &s;ect; from the decla|matory
Narrative which celebrates the deaths
of the per&s;ecutors; and from the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Hi&s;tory of Eu&s;ebius, who has pre&s;erved &s;ome
valuable fragments of more early writers.
Since the revival of letters, the&s;e original ma|terials
have been the common fund of critics
and hi&s;torians: nor has it ever been imagined,
that the ab&s;olute and exclu&s;ive property of a
pa&s;&s;age in Eu&s;ebius or Tertullian was acquired
by the fir&s;t who had an opportunity of quoting
it. The learned work of Mo&s;heim, <HI>de Rebus
Chri&s;tianis ante Con&s;tantinum,</HI> was printed in the
year 1753; and if I were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the pa|tience
and di&s;ingenuity of Mr. Davis, I would
engage to find all the ancient te&s;timonies that
he has alleged, in the writings of Dodwell or
<PB N="90" REF="92">
Tillemont, which were publi&s;hed before the
end of the la&s;t century. But if I were animated
by any malevolent intentions again&s;t Dodwell
or Tillemont, I could as ea&s;ily, and as unfairly,
fix on <HI>them</HI> the guilt of Plagiari&s;m, by pro|ducing
the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ages tran&s;cribed or tran&s;|lated
at full length in the Annals of Cardinal
Baronius. Let not critici&s;m be any longer di&s;|graced
by the practice of &s;uch unworthy arts.
In&s;tead of admitting &s;u&s;picions as fal&s;e as they
are ungenerous, condour will acknowledge,
that Mo&s;heim or Dodwell, Tillemont or Baro|nius,
enjoyed the &s;ame right, and often were
under the &s;ame obligation, of quoting the pa&s;|&s;ages
which they had read, and which were in|di&s;pen&s;ably
requi&s;ite to confirm the truth and
&s;ub&s;tance of their &s;imilar narratives. Mr. Davis
is &s;o far from allowing me the benefit of this
common indulgence, or rather of this common
right, that he &s;tigmatizes with the name of
<HI>Plagiari&s;m</HI> a clo&s;e and literal agreement with
Dodwell in the account of &s;ome parts of the
per&s;ecution of Diocletian, where a few chap|ters
of Eu&s;ebius and Lactantius, perhaps of
Lactantius alone, are the &s;ole materials from
whence our knowledge could be derived, and
where, if I had not tran&s;cribed, I mu&s;t have
invented. He is even bold enough (<HI>bold</HI> is not
the <HI>proper</HI> word) to conceive &s;ome hopes of
<PB N="91" REF="93">
per&s;uading his readers, that in Hi&s;torian who
has employed &s;everal years of his life, and
&s;everal hundred pages, on the Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire, had never read Oro&s;ius,
or the Augu&s;tan Hi&s;tory; and that he was
forced to borrow, at &s;econd-hand, his quota|tions
from the Theodo&s;ian Code. I cannot
profe&s;s my&s;elf very de&s;irous of Mr. Davis's ac|quaintance;
but if he will take the trouble of
calling at my hou&s;e any afternoon when I am
<HI>not</HI> at home, my &s;ervant &s;hall &s;hew him my
library, which he will find tolerably well fur|ni&s;hed
with the u&s;eful authors, ancient as well
as modern, eccle&s;ia&s;tical as well as profane,
who have <HI>directly</HI> &s;upplied me with the mate|rials
of my Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The peculiar rea&s;ons, and they are not of the
mo&s;t flattering kind, which urged me to repel
the furious and feeble attack of Mr. Davis,
have been already mentioned. But &s;ince I am
drawn thus reluctantly into the li&s;ts of contro|ver&s;y,
I &s;hall not retire till I have &s;aluted, ei|ther
with &s;tern defiance or gentle courte&s;y,
the theological champions who have &s;ignalized
their ardour to break a lance again&s;t the &s;hield

judgment and learning than could rea&s;onably
be expected from the unfini&s;hed &s;tudies of a

Dr. Randolph, Pre&s;ident of Chri&s;t Church

<NOTE PLACE="marg">DR. WAT|SON.</NOTE>
<P>When Dr. Wat&s;on gave to the Public his
Apology for Chri&s;tianity, in a Series of Let|ters,
he addre&s;&s;ed them to the Author of the
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, with
a ju&s;t confidence that he had con&s;idered this
important object in a manner not unworthy of
his antagoni&s;t or of him&s;elf. Dr. Wat&s;on's
mode of thinking bears a liberal and philo&s;o|phic
ca&s;t; his thoughts are expre&s;&s;ed with
&s;pirit, and that &s;pirit is always tempered by
politene&s;s and moderation. Such is the man
whom I &s;hould be happy to call my friend,
and whom I &s;hould not blu&s;h to call my an|tagoni&s;t.
But the &s;ame motives which might
tempt me to accept, or even to &s;olicit, a pri|vate
and amicable conference, di&s;&s;uaded me
from entering into a public controver&s;y with a
Writer of &s;o re&s;pectable a character; and I em|braced
the earlie&s;t opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing to
Dr. Wat&s;on him&s;elf, how &s;incerely I agreed
<PB N="94" REF="96">
with him in thinking, <Q REND="inline">That as the world is
now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the opinion of us both upon
the &s;ubject in que&s;tion, it may be perhaps
as proper for us both to leave it in this
&s;tate<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Wat&s;on's Apology for Chri&s;tianity, p. 200.</NOTE>.</Q> The nature of the ingenious Pro|fe&s;&s;or's
Apology contributed to &s;trengthen the
in&s;uperable reluctance to engage in ho&s;tile al|tercation
which was common to us both, by
convincing me, that &s;uch an altercation was
unnece&s;&s;ary as well as unplea&s;ant. He very
ju&s;tly and politely declares, that a con&s;ider|able
part, near &s;eventy pages, of his &s;mall vo|lume
are not directed to me<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 202&mdash;268.</NOTE>, but to a &s;et of
men whom he places in an odious and con|temptible
light. He leaves to other hands the
defence of the leading Eccle&s;ia&s;tics, even of
the primitive church; and without being <HI>very</HI>
anxious, either to &s;often their vices and indi&s;|cretion,
or to aggravate the cruelty of the
Heathen Per&s;ecutors, he pa&s;&s;es over in &s;ilence
the greate&s;t part of my Sixteenth Chapter. It
is not &s;o much the purpo&s;e of the Apologi&s;t to
examine the facts which have been advanced
by the Hi&s;torian, as to remove the impre&s;&s;ions
which may have been formed by many of his
Readers; and the remarks of Dr. Wat&s;on con&s;i&s;t
more properly of general argumentation than of
<PB N="95" REF="97">
particular critici&s;m. He fairly owns, that I
have expre&s;sly allowed the full and irre&s;i&s;tible
weight of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> great cau&s;e of the &s;ucce&s;s of
Chri&s;tianity<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Wat&s;on's Apology for Chri&s;tianity, p. 5.</NOTE>, and he is too candid to deny
that the five <HI>&s;econdary</HI> cau&s;es, which I had at|tempted
to explain, operated with <HI>&s;ome</HI> degree
of active energy towards the accompli&s;hment
of that great event. The only que&s;tion which
remains between us, relates to the <HI>degree</HI> of
the weight and effect of tho&s;e &s;econdary cau&s;es;
and as I am per&s;uaded that our philo&s;ophy is
not of the dogmatic kind, we &s;hould &s;oon ac|knowledge
that this preci&s;e degree cannot be
a&s;certained by rea&s;oning, nor perhaps be ex|pre&s;&s;ed
by words. In the cour&s;e of this en|quiry,
&s;ome incidental difficulties have ari&s;en,
which I had &s;tated with impartiality, and which
Dr. Wat&s;on re&s;olves with ingenuity and tem|per.
If in &s;ome in&s;tances he &s;eems to have
mi&s;apprehended my &s;entiments, I may he&s;itate
whether I &s;hould impute the fault to my own
want of clearne&s;s or to his want of attention,
but I can never entertain a &s;u&s;picion that Dr.
Wat&s;on would de&s;cend to employ the di&s;inge|nuous
arts of vulgar controver&s;y.</P>
<P>There is, however, one pa&s;&s;age, and one pa&s;|&s;age
only, which mu&s;t not pa&s;s without &s;ome
<PB N="96" REF="98">
explanation; and I &s;hall the more eagerly em|brace
this occa&s;ion to illu&s;trate what I had &s;aid,
as the mi&s;con&s;truction of my true meaning
&s;eems to have made an involuntary, but unfa|vourable,
impre&s;&s;ion on the liberal mind of Dr.
Wat&s;on. As I endeavour <HI>not</HI> to palliate the
&s;everity, but to di&s;cover the motives, of the
Roman Magi&s;trates. I had remarked, <Q REND="inline">it
was in vain that the oppre&s;&s;ed Believer
a&s;&s;erted the unalienable rights of con|&s;cience
and private judgment. Though his
&s;ituation might excite the pity, his argu|ments
could never reach the under&s;tanding,
either of the philo&s;ophic or of the believing
part of the Pagan world<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 625.</NOTE>.</Q> The humanity
of Dr. Wat&s;on takes fire on the &s;uppo&s;ed pro|vocation,
and he a&s;ks me with unu&s;ual quick|ne&s;s,
<Q REND="inline">How, Sir, are the arguments for liberty
of con&s;cience &s;o exceedingly inconclu&s;ive,
that you think them incapable of reaching
the under&s;tanding even of philo&s;ophers<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Wat&s;on, p. 185.</NOTE>?</Q>
He continues to ob&s;erve, that a captious ad|ver&s;ary
would embrace with avidity the op|portunity
this pa&s;&s;age <HI>affords</HI> of blotting my
character with the odious &s;tain of being a Per|&s;ecutor;
a &s;tain which no learning can wipe
out, which no genius or ability can render
<PB N="97" REF="99">
amiable; and though he him&s;elf does not en|tertain
&s;uch an opinion of my principles, his
ingenuity tries in vain to provide me with the
means of e&s;cape.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t lament that I have not been &s;ucce&s;&s;|ful
in the explanation of a very &s;imple notion
of the &s;pirit both of philo&s;ophy and of poly|thei&s;m,
which I have repeatedly inculcated.
The arguments which a&s;&s;ert the rights of con|&s;cience
are not inconclu&s;ive in them&s;elves, but
the under&s;tanding of the Greeks and Romans
was fortified again&s;t their evidence by an in|vincible
prejudice. When we li&s;ten to the voice
of Bayle, of Locke, and of genuine rea&s;on, in
favour of religious toleration, we &s;hall ea&s;ily
perceive that our mo&s;t forcible appeal is made
to our mutual feelings. If the Jew was al|lowed
to argue with the Inqui&s;itor, he would
reque&s;t that for a moment they might ex|change
their different &s;ituations, and might
&s;afely a&s;k his Catholic Tyrant, whether the fear
of death would compel <HI>him</HI> to enter the &s;yna|as
gogue, to receive the mark of circumci&s;ion,
and to partake of the pa&s;chal lamb. As &s;oon
as the ca&s;e of per&s;ecution was brought home to
the brea&s;t of the Inqui&s;itor, he mu&s;t have &s;ound
&s;ome difficulty in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the dictates of
natural equity, which would in&s;inuate to his
con&s;cience, that he could have no right to in|flict
<PB N="98" REF="100">
tho&s;e puni&s;hments which, under &s;imilar
circum&s;tances, he would e&s;teem it as his duty
to encounter. But this argument could not
reach the under&s;tanding of a Polythei&s;t, or of
an ancient Philo&s;opher. The former was ready,
whenever he was &s;ummoned, or indeed with|out
being &s;ummoned, to fall pro&s;trate before
the altars of any Gods who were adored in any
part of the world, and to admit a vague per|&s;ua&s;ion
of the <HI>truth</HI> and divinity of the mo&s;t
different modes of religion. The Philo&s;opher,
who con&s;idered them, at lea&s;t in their literal
&s;en&s;e, as equally <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and ab&s;urd, was not
a&s;hamed to di&s;gui&s;e his &s;entiments, and to
frame his actions according to the laws of his
country, which impo&s;ed the &s;ame obligation
on the philo&s;ophers and the people. When
Pliny declared, that whatever was the opinion
of the Chri&s;tians, their ob&s;tinacy de&s;erved pu|ni&s;hment,
the ab&s;urd cruelty of Pliny was
excu&s;ed in his own eye, by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
that, in the &s;ituation of the Chri&s;tians, he would
not have refu&s;ed the religious compliance which
he exacted. I &s;hall not repeat, that the Pa|gan
wor&s;hip was a matter, not of <HI>opinion,</HI>
but of <HI>cu&s;tom</HI>; that the toleration of the Ro|mans
was confined to nations or families who
followed the practice of their ance&s;tors; and
that in the fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity their per|&s;ecution
<PB N="99" REF="101">
of the individuals who departed from
the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion was neither moderated
by pure rea&s;on, nor inflamed by exclu&s;ive zeal.
But I only de&s;ire to appeal from the ha&s;ty ap|prehen&s;ion
to the more deliberate judgment of
Dr. Wat&s;on him&s;elf. Should there &s;till remain
any difference of opinion between us, I &s;hall be
&s;atisfied, if he will con&s;ider me as a &s;incere,
though perhaps un&s;ucce&s;sful, lover of truth,
and as a firm friend to civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical
freedom.</P>

<P>Far be it from me, or from any faithful
Hi&s;torian, to impute to re&s;pectable &s;ocieties
the faults of &s;ome individual members. Our
two Univer&s;ities mo&s;t undoubtedly contain the
&s;ame mixture, and mo&s;t probably the &s;ame
proportions, of zeal and moderation, of rea&s;on
and &s;uper&s;tition. Yet there is much le&s;s dif|ference
between the &s;moothne&s;s of the Ionic
and the roughne&s;s of the Doric dialect, than
may be found between the poli&s;hed &s;tyle of Dr.
Wat&s;on, and the coar&s;e language of Mr. Davis,
Dr. Chel&s;um, or Dr. Randolph. The &s;econd
of the&s;e Critics, Dr. Chel&s;um of Chri&s;t Church,
is unwilling that the world &s;hould forget that
<HI>he</HI> was the fir&s;t who &s;ounded to arms, that <HI>he</HI>
was the fir&s;t who furni&s;hed the antidote to the
poi&s;on, and who, as early as the month of
October of the year 1776, publi&s;hed his <HI>Stric|tures</HI>
on the Two la&s;t Chapters of Mr. Gibbon's
<PB N="100" REF="102">
Hi&s;tory. The &s;ucce&s;s of a pamphlet, which
he mode&s;tly &s;tyles imperfect and ill-dige&s;ted,
encouraged him to re&s;ume the controver&s;y.
In the beginning of the pre&s;ent year, his Re|marks
made their &s;econd appearance, with &s;ome
alteration of form, and a large increa&s;e of
bulk; and the author, who &s;eems to fight un|der
the protection of two epi&s;copal banners,
has prefixed, in the front of his volume, his
name and titles, which in the former edition he
had le&s;s honourably &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. His confidence
is fortified by the alliance and communications
of a <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hed</HI> Writer, Dr. Randolph, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
who, on a proper occa&s;ion, would, no doubt,
be ready to bear as honourable te&s;timony to
the merit and reputation of Dr. Chel&s;um. The
two friends are indeed &s;o happily united by art
and nature, that if the author of the Remarks
had not pointed out the valuable communica|cations
of the Margaret Profe&s;&s;or, it would
have been impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate their re&s;pective
property. Writers who po&s;&s;e&s;s any freedom of
mind, may be known from each other by the
peculiar character of their &s;tyle and &s;entiments;
but the champions who are inli&s;ted in the &s;er|vice
of Authority, commonly wear the uniform
of the regiment. Oppre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame
yoke, covered with the &s;ame trappings, they
heavily move along, perhaps not with an equal
pace, in the &s;ame beaten track of prejudice and
<PB N="101" REF="103">
preferment. Yet I &s;hould expo&s;e my own in|ju&s;tice,
were I ab&s;olutely to confound with
Mr. Davis the two Doctors in Divinity, who
are joined in one volume. The three Critics
appear to be animated by the &s;ame implacable
re&s;entment again&s;t the Hi&s;torian of the Roman
Empire; they are alike di&s;po&s;ed to &s;upport
the &s;ame opinions by the &s;ame arts; and if in
the language of the two latter the di&s;regard of
politene&s;s is &s;omewhat le&s;s gro&s;s and indecent,
the difference is not of &s;uch a magnitude as to
excite in my brea&s;t any lively &s;en&s;ations of
gratitude. It was the misfortune of Mr. Davis
that he undertook to <HI>write</HI> before he had <HI>read.</HI>
He &s;et out with the &s;tock of authorities which
he found in my quotations, and boldly ven|tured
to play his reputation again&s;t mine. Per|haps
he may now repent of a lo&s;s which is not
ea&s;ily recovered; but if I had not &s;urmounted
my almo&s;t in&s;uperable reluctance to a public
di&s;pute, many a reader might &s;till be dazzled
by the vehemence of his a&s;&s;ertions, and might
&s;till believe that Mr. Davis had detected &s;e|veral
wilful and important mi&s;repre&s;entations
in my Two la&s;t Chapters. But the confederate
Doctors appear to be &s;cholars of a higher form
and longer experience; they enjoy a certain
rank in their academical world; and as their
zeal is enlightened by &s;ome rays of knowledge,
&s;o their de&s;ire to ruin the credit of their adver|&s;ary
<PB N="102" REF="104">
is occa&s;ionally checked by the apprehen|&s;ion
of injuring their own. The&s;e re&s;traints,
to which Mr. Davis was a &s;tranger, have con|fined
them to a very narrow and humble path
of hi&s;torical critici&s;m; and if I were to correct,
according to their wi&s;hes, all the particular
facts again&s;t which they have advanced any ob|jections,
the&s;e corrections, admitted in their

of Jo&s;ephus, I may deem my&s;elf &s;ecure behind
the &s;hield of learned and pious critics (See in
particular Le Clerc, in his Ars Critica, part
iii. &s;ect. i. c. 15. and Lardner's Te&s;timonies,
Vol. i. p. 150, &amp;c.), who have condemned
this pa&s;&s;age: and I think it very natural that
Dr. Chel&s;um &s;hould embrace the contrary opi|nion,
which is not de&s;titute of able advocates.
The pa&s;&s;ages of Irenaeus and Theophilus were
thoroughly &s;ifted in the controver&s;y about the
duration of Miracles; and as the Works of Dr.
Middleton may be found in every library, &s;o
it is not impo&s;&s;ible that a diligent &s;earch may
&s;till di&s;cover &s;ome remains of the writings of
his adver&s;aries. In mentioning the confe&s;&s;ion
of the Syrians of Pale&s;tine, that they had received
from Egypt the rite of circumci&s;ion, I had &s;im|ply
alleged the te&s;timony of Herodotus, without
expre&s;sly adopting the &s;entiment of Mar&s;ham.
But I had always imagined, that in the&s;e doubt|ful
and indifferent que&s;tions, which have been &s;o|lemnly
argued before the tribunal of the Public,
every &s;cholar was at liberty to chu&s;e his &s;ide,
without a&s;&s;igning his rea&s;ons; nor can I yet
per&s;uade my&s;elf, that either Dr. Chel&s;um, or
my&s;elf, are likely to enforce, by any new argu|ments,
the opinions which we have re&s;pectively
followed. The only novelty for which I can
perceive my&s;elf indebted to Dr. Chel&s;um, is
the very extraordinary Sceptici&s;m which he in|&s;inuates
concerning the time of Herodotus,
<PB N="105" REF="107">
who, according to the chronology of &s;ome, flou|ri&s;hed
during the time of the Jewi&s;h captivity<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Chel&s;um, p. 15.</NOTE>.
Can it be nece&s;&s;ary to inform a Divine, that
the captivity which la&s;ted &s;eventy years, ac|cording
to the prophecy of Jeremiah, was ter|minated
in the year 536 before Chri&s;t, by the
edict which Cyrus publi&s;hed in the fir&s;t year of
his reign (Jeremiah, xxv. 11, 12. xxix. 10.
Ezra, i. 1. &amp;c. U&s;her and Prideaux, under the
years 606 and 536.)? Can it be nece&s;&s;ary to in|form
a man of letters, that Herodotus was
fifty-three years old at the commencement of
the Peloponne&s;ian war (Aulus Gellius, Noct.
Attic. xv. 23. from the Commentaries of Pam|phila),
and con&s;equently that he was born in
the year before Chri&s;t 484, fifty-two years
after the end of the Jewi&s;h captivity? As this
well atte&s;ted fact is not expo&s;ed to the &s;lighte&s;t
doubt or difficulty, I am &s;omewhat curious to
learn the names of tho&s;e unknown authors,
who&s;e chronology Dr. Chel&s;um has allowed as
the &s;pecious foundation of a probable hypothe|&s;is.
The Author of the Remarks, does not
&s;eem indeed to have cultivated, with much care
or &s;ucce&s;s, the province of literary hi&s;tory; as
a very moderate acquaintance with that u&s;eful
branch of knowledge would have &s;aved him
from a po&s;itive mi&s;take, much le&s;s excu&s;able
<PB N="106" REF="108">
than the doubt which he entertains about the
time of Herodotus. He &s;tyles Suidas <Q REND="inline">a

the <HI>tenth</HI> century<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Chel&s;um. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>.</Q> I admit the period
which he a&s;&s;igns to Suidas; and which is well
a&s;certained by Dr. Bentley (See his Reply to
Boyle, p. 22, 23.) We are led to fix this
epoch by the chronology which this <HI>Heathen</HI>
writer has deduced from Adam, to the death of
the emperor John Zimi&s;ces, A. D. 975: and a
crowd of pa&s;&s;ages might be produced, as the
una&s;werable evidence of his Chri&s;tianity. But
the mo&s;t unan&s;werable of all is the very date,
which is not di&s;puted between us. The philo|&s;ophers
who flouri&s;hed under Ju&s;tinian (See
Agathias, l. ii. p. 65, 66.), appear to have
been the la&s;t of the Heathen writers: and the
ancient religion of the Greeks was annihilated
almo&s;t four hundred years before the birth of
Suidas.</P>
<P>After this animadver&s;ion, which is not in|tended

important parts of Dr. Chel&s;um's Remarks,

to the reproaches of the Pagans, by their

<P>On this occa&s;ion Dr. Chel&s;um is extremely

&s;tory of Marcellus, not from Ruinart, but

it highly improbable that Origen &s;hould dare to

he mu&s;t yet &s;urely have been with-held from

The experience both of ancient
and modern controver&s;y, has indeed convinced
me that this rea&s;oning, ju&s;t and natural as it
may &s;eem, is totally inconclu&s;ive, and that the
generality of di&s;putants, e&s;pecially in religious
conte&s;ts, are of a much more daring and intre|pid
&s;pirit. For the truth of this remark, I &s;hall
content my&s;elf with producing a recent and very
&s;ingular example, in which Dr. Chel&s;um him|&s;elf
is per&s;onally intere&s;ted. He charges<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 188.</NOTE> me
with pa&s;&s;ing over in <Q REND="inline">&s;ilence the important
and un&s;u&s;pected te&s;timony of a Heathen hi|&s;torian
(Dion Ca&s;&s;ius) to the per&s;ecution of
Domitian; and he affirms, that I have pro|duced
that te&s;timony &s;o far only as it relates
to Clemens and Domitilla; yet in the very
&s;ame pa&s;&s;age, follows immediately, that on
a like accu&s;ation MANY OTHERS were al&s;o
condemned. Some of them were put to
<PB N="109" REF="115">
death, others &s;uffered the confi&s;cation of
their goods<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 645.</NOTE>.</Q> Although I &s;hould not be
a&s;hamed to undertake the apology of Nero or
Domitian, if I thought them innocent of any
particular crime with which zeal or malice had
unju&s;tly branded their memory; yet I &s;hould
indeed blu&s;h, if, in favour of tyranny, or even
in favour of virtue, I had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the truth
and evidence of hi&s;torical facts. But the
Reader will feel &s;ome &s;urprize, when he has
convinced him&s;elf that, in the three editions of
my Fir&s;t Volume, after relating the death of
Clemens, and the exile of Domitilla, I continue
to allege the ENTIRE TESTIMONY of Dion, in
the following words: <Q REND="inline">and &s;entences either
of death, or of confi&s;cation, were pronounced
again&s;t a GREAT NUMBER OF PERSONS who
were involved in the SAME accu&s;ation. The
guilt imputed to their charge, was that of
Athei&s;m and Jewi&s;h manners; a &s;ingular
a&s;&s;ociation of ideas which cannot with any
propriety be applied except to the Chri&s;tians,
as they were ob&s;curely and imperfectly
viewed by the magi&s;trates and writers of
that period.</Q> Dr. Chel&s;um has not been
deterred, by the fear of detection, from this
&s;candalous mutilation of the popular work of a
living adver&s;ary. But Cel&s;us had been dead
<PB N="110" REF="116">
above fifty years before Origen publi&s;hed his
Apology; and the copies of an ancient work,
in&s;tead of being in&s;tantaneou&s;ly multiplied by
the operation of the pre&s;s, were &s;eparately and
&s;lowly tran&s;cribed by the labour of the hand.</P>
<P>If any modern Divine &s;hould &s;till maintain
that the fidelity of Origen was &s;ecured by mo|tives
more honourable than the fear of detec|tion,
he may learn from Jerom the difference
of the <HI>gymna&s;tic</HI> and <HI>dogmatic</HI> &s;tyles. Truth is
the object of the one, Victory of the other;
and the &s;ame arts which would di&s;grace the
&s;incerity of the teacher, &s;erve only to di&s;play
the &s;kill of the di&s;putant. After ju&s;tifying his
own practice by that of the orators and philo|&s;ophers,
Jerom defends him&s;elf by the more

<P>Yet Dr. Chel&s;um may &s;till a&s;k, and he has
a right to a&s;k, why in this particular in&s;tance I
&s;u&s;pect the pious Origen of mutilating the ob|jections
of his adver&s;ary. From a very obvi|ous,
and, in my opinion, a very deci&s;ive cir|cum&s;tance.
Cel&s;us was a Greek philo&s;opher,
the friend of Lucian; and I thought that al|though
he might &s;upport error by &s;ophi&s;try, he
would not write non&s;en&s;e in his own language.
I renounce my &s;u&s;picion, if the mo&s;t attentive
reader is able to under&s;tand the de&s;ign and pur|port
of a pa&s;&s;age which is given as a formal
quotation from Cel&s;us, and which begins with
the following words: <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">,
&amp;c. (Origen contr. Cel&s;um, l. viii.
p. 425. edit. Spencer, Cantab. 1677.) I have
carefully in&s;pected the original, I have availed
my&s;elf of the learning of Spencer, and even
Bouhereau (for I &s;hall always di&s;claim the ab|&s;urd
and affected pedantry of u&s;ing without
&s;cruple a Latin ver&s;ion, but of de&s;pi&s;ing the
aid of a French tran&s;lation), and the ill &s;ucce&s;s
of my efforts has countenanced the &s;u&s;picion to
which I &s;till adhere, with a ju&s;t mixture of
doubt and he&s;itation. Origen very boldly de|nies,
<PB N="112" REF="118">
that any of the Chri&s;tians have affirmed
what is imputed to them by Cel&s;us, in this un|intelligible
quotation; and it may ea&s;ily be cre|dited,
that none had maintained what none
can comprehend. Dr. Chel&s;um has produced
the words of Origen; but on this occa&s;ion
there is a &s;trange ambiguity in the language of
the modern Divine<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Chel&s;um, p. 118.</NOTE>, as if he wi&s;hed to in&s;inu|ate
what he dared not affirm; and every reader
mu&s;t conclude, from his &s;tate of the que&s;tion,
that Origen expre&s;sly denied the truth of the
<HI>accu&s;ation</HI> of Cel&s;us, who had <HI>accu&s;ed</HI> the Chri|&s;tians
of declining to a&s;&s;i&s;t their fellow-&s;ubjects
in the military defence of the empire, a&s;&s;ailed
on every &s;ide by the arms of the Barbarians.</P>
<P>Will Dr. Chel&s;um ju&s;tify to the world, can
he ju&s;tify to his own feelings, the abu&s;e which
he has made even of the privileges of the Gym|na&s;tic
&s;tyle? Carele&s;s and ha&s;ty indeed mu&s;t
have been his peru&s;al of Origen, if he did not
perceive that the ancient Apologi&s;t, who makes
a &s;tand on &s;ome incidental que&s;tion, admits
the accu&s;ation of his adver&s;ary, that the Chri|&s;tians
<HI>refu&s;ed</HI> to bear arms even at the com|mand
of their Sovereign. "<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">" (Origen, l. viii. p. 427.)
He endeavours to palliate this undutiful refu|&s;al,
by repre&s;enting that the Chri&s;tians had
<PB N="113" REF="119">
their peculiar camps, in which they ince&s;&s;antly
combated for the &s;afety of the emperor and
the empire by lifting up their right hands&mdash;in
prayer. The Apologi&s;t &s;eems to hope that his
country will be &s;atisfied with this &s;piritual aid,
and dexterou&s;ly confounding the colleges of
Roman prie&s;ts with the multitudes which &s;welled
the Catholic Church, he claims for his bre|thren,
in all the provinces, the exemption
from military &s;ervice, which was enjoyed by
the &s;acerdotal order. But as this excu&s;e might
not readily be allowed, Origen looks forwards
with a lively faith to that au&s;picious Revolu|tion,
which Cel&s;us had rejected as impo&s;&s;ible,
when all the nations of the habitable earth, re|nouncing
their pa&s;&s;ions and their arms, &s;hould
embrace the pure doctrines of the Go&s;pel, and
lead a life of peace and innocence under the
immediate protection of Heaven. The faith
of Origen &s;eems to be principally founded on
the predictions of the Prophet Zephaniah (See
iii. 9, 10.); and he prudently ob&s;erves, that
the Prophets often &s;peak &s;ecret things (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">,
p. 426.) which may be under|&s;tood
by tho&s;e who can under&s;tand them; and
that if this &s;tupendous change cannot be ef|fected
while we retain our bodies, it may be
accompli&s;hed as &s;oon as we &s;hall be relea&s;ed
from them. Such is the rea&s;oning of Origen:
though I have not followed the order, I have
<PB N="114" REF="120">
faithfully pre&s;erved the &s;ub&s;tance of it; which
fully ju&s;tifies the truth and propriety of my
ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The execution of Marcellus, the Centurion,
is naturally connected with the Apology of
Origen, as the former declared by his actions,
what the latter had affirmed in his writings,
that the con&s;cience of a devout Chri&s;tian would
not allow him to bear arms, even at the com|mand
of his Sovereign. I had repre&s;ented this
religious &s;cruple as <HI>one</HI> of the motives which
provoked Marcellus, on the day of a public
fe&s;tival, to throw away the en&s;igns of his of|fice;
and I pre&s;umed to ob&s;erve, that &s;uch
an act of de&s;ertion would have been puni&s;hed
in any government according to martial or
even civil law. Dr. Chel&s;um<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Chel&s;um, p. 114&mdash;117.</NOTE> very <HI>bluntly</HI>
accu&s;es me of mi&s;repre&s;enting the &s;tory, and of
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e circum&s;tances which would
have defended the Centurion from the unju&s;t
imputation thrown by me upon his conduct.
The di&s;pute between the Advocate for Mar|cellus
and my&s;elf, lies in a very narrow com|pa&s;s;
as the whole evidence is comprized in a
&s;hort, &s;imple, and, I believe, authentic nar|rative.</P>
<P N="1">1. In another place I ob&s;erved, and even
pre&s;&s;ed the ob&s;ervation, <Q REND="inline">that the innume|rable
Deities and rites of Polythei&s;m were
<PB N="115" REF="121">
clo&s;ely interwoven with every circum&s;tance
of bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure, of public or of private
life;</Q> and I had particularly &s;pecified how
much the Roman di&s;cipline was connected with
the national &s;uper&s;tition. A &s;olemn oath of
fidelity was repeated every year in the name of
the Gods and of the genius of the Emperor,
public and daily &s;acrifices were performed at the
head of the camp, the legionary was continually
tempted, or rather compelled to join in the ido|latrous
wor&s;hip of his fellow-&s;oldiers, and had
not any &s;cruples been entertained of the law|fulne&s;s
of war, it is not ea&s;y to under&s;tand how
any &s;erious Chri&s;tian could inli&s;t under a ban|ner
which has been ju&s;tly termed the <HI>rival of
the Cro&s;s.</HI> "Vexilla aemula Chri&s;ti." (Ter|tullian
de Corona Militis, c. xi.) With regard
to the &s;oldiers, who before their conver&s;ion
were already engaged in the military life, fear,
habit, ignorance, nece&s;&s;ity might bend them to
&s;ome acts of occa&s;ional conformity; and as
long as they ab&s;tained from ab&s;olute and in|tentional
idolatry, their behaviour was excu&s;ed
by the indulgent, and cen&s;ured by the more
rigid ca&s;ui&s;ts. (See the whole Treati&s;e <HI>De Co|ron&acirc;
Militis.</HI>) We are ignorant of the adven|tures
and character of the Centurion Marcellus,
how long he had conciliated the profe&s;&s;ion of
arms and of the Go&s;pel, whether he was only a
Catechumen, or whether he was initiated by
<PB N="116" REF="122">
the Sacrament of Bapti&s;m. We are likewi&s;e at
a lo&s;s to a&s;certain the particular act of idolatry
which &s;o &s;uddenly and &s;o forcibly provoked his
pious indignation. As he declared his faith in
the mid&s;t of a public entertainment given on
the birth-day of Galerius, he mu&s;t have been
&s;tartled by &s;ome of the &s;acred and convivial
rites (Convivia i&s;ta profana reputans) of
prayers, or vows, or libations, or, perhaps, by
the offen&s;ive circum&s;tance of eating the meats
which had been offered to the idols. But the
&s;cruples of Marcellus were not confined to
the&s;e accidental impurities; they evidently
reached the e&s;&s;ential duties of his profe&s;&s;ion;
and when before the tribunal of the magi|&s;trates,
he avowed his faith at the hazard of
his life, the Centurion declared, as his cool
and determined per&s;ua&s;ion, that it does not
become a Chri&s;tian man, who is the &s;oldier of
the Lord Chri&s;t, to bear arms for any object
of earthly concern. <Q REND="inline">Non enim decebat
Chri&s;tianum hominem mole&s;tiis &s;ecularibus
militare, qui Chri&s;to Domino militat.</Q> A
formal declaration, which clearly di&s;engages
from each other the different que&s;tions of war
and idolatry. With regard to both the&s;e
que&s;tions, as they were under&s;tood by the pri|mitive
Chri&s;tians, I wi&s;h to refer the Reader
to the &s;entiments and authorities of Mr. Moyle,
a bold and ingenious critic, who read the Fa|thers
<PB N="117" REF="123">
as their judge, and not as their &s;lave,
and who has refuted, with the mo&s;t patient
candour, all that learned prejudice could &s;ug|ge&s;t
in favour of the &s;illy &s;tory of the thunder|ing
legion. (See Moyle's Works, Vol. ii.
p. 84&mdash;88. 111&mdash;116. 163&mdash;212. 298&mdash;302.
327&mdash;341.) And here let me add, that the
pa&s;&s;age of Origen, who in the name of his bre|thren
di&s;claims the duty of military &s;ervice, is
under&s;tood by Mr. Moyle in its true and ob|vious
&s;ignification.</P>
<P N="2">2. I know not where Dr. Chel&s;um has im|bibed
the principles of logic or morality which
teach him to approve the conduct of Marcel|lus,
who threw down his rod, his belt, and
his arms, at the head of the legion, and pub|licly
renounced the military &s;ervice, <HI>at the very
time</HI> when he found him&s;elf obliged to offer &s;a|crifice.
Yet &s;urely this is a very fal&s;e notion
of the condition and duties of a Roman Cen|turion.
Marcellus was bound, by a &s;olemn
oath, to &s;erve with fidelity till he &s;hould be
regularly di&s;charged; and according to the
&s;entiments which Dr. Chel&s;um a&s;cribes to him,
he was not relea&s;ed from this oath by any mi&s;|taken
opinion of the unlawfulne&s;s of war. I
would propo&s;e it as a ca&s;e of con&s;cience to any
philo&s;opher, or even to any ca&s;ui&s;t in Europe,
Whether a particular order, which cannot
be reconciled with virtue or piety, di&s;&s;olves the
<PB N="118" REF="124">
ties of a general and lawful obligation? And
whether, if they had been con&s;ulted by the
Chri&s;tian Centurion, they would not have di|rected
him to increa&s;e his diligence in the execu|tion
of his military functions, to refu&s;e to yield to
any act of idolatry, and patiently to expect the
con&s;equences of &s;uch a refu&s;al? But in&s;tead of
obeying the mild and moderate dictates of re|ligion,
in&s;tead of di&s;tingui&s;hing between the
duties of the &s;oldier and of the Chri&s;tian, Mar|cellus,
with imprudent zeal, ru&s;hed forwards
to &s;eize the crown of martyrdom. He might
have privately confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf guilty to the
tribune or praefect under whom he &s;erved: he
cho&s;e on the day of a public fe&s;tival to di&s;turb
the order of the camp. He in&s;ulted without
nece&s;&s;ity the religion of his Sovereign and of
his country, by the epithets of contempt which
he be&s;towed on the Roman Gods. <Q REND="inline">Deos
ve&s;tros ligneos et lapideos, adorare contemno,
quae &s;unt idola &s;urda et muta.</Q> Nay more:
at the head of the legion, and in the face of
the &s;tandards, the Centurion Marcellus openly
renounced his allegiance to the Emperors. <Q REND="inline">Exhoc

From this moment I no longer &s;erve
YOUR EMPERORS, are the important words of
Marcellus, which his advocate has not thought
proper to tran&s;late. I again make my appeal
to any lawyer, to any military man, Whether,
<PB N="119" REF="125">
under &s;uch circum&s;tances, the pronoun <HI>your</HI>
has not a &s;editious and even trea&s;onable im|port?
And whether the officer who &s;hould
make this declaration, and at the &s;ame time
throw away his &s;word at the head of the regi|ment,
would not be condemned for mutiny
and de&s;ertion by any court-martial in Europe?
I am the rather di&s;po&s;ed to judge favourably of
the conduct of the Roman government, as I
cannot di&s;cover any de&s;ire to take advantage
of the indi&s;cretion of Marcellus. The Com|mander
of the Legion &s;eemed to lament that
it was not in his power to di&s;&s;emble this ra&s;h
action. After a delay of more than three
months, the Centurion was examined before
the Vice-praefect, his &s;uperior Judge, who offer|ed
him the faire&s;t opportunities of explaining
or qualifying his &s;editious expre&s;&s;ions, and at
la&s;t condemned him to lo&s;e his head; not &s;im|ply
becau&s;e he was a Chri&s;tian, but becau&s;e he
had violated his military oath, thrown away
his belt, and publicly bla&s;phemed the Gods
and the Emperors. Perhaps the impartial
reader will confirm the &s;entence of the Vice-Praefect
Agricolanus, <Q REND="inline">Ita &s;e habent facta

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the plaine&s;t evidence, Dr.

object to the u&s;e of arms; <Q REND="inline">becau&s;e it is

of war altogether, whole legions of

I have not yet di&s;covered, in the Author or
Authors of the Remarks, many traces of a
clear and enlightened under&s;tanding, yet I can|not
&s;uppo&s;e them &s;o de&s;titute of every rea&s;oning
principle, as to imagine that they here allude
to the conduct of the Chri&s;tians who embraced
the profe&s;&s;ion of arms after their religion had
obtained a public e&s;tabli&s;hment. Whole legi|ons
of Chri&s;tians &s;erved under the banners of
Con&s;tantine and Ju&s;tinian, as whole regiments
of Chri&s;tians are now inli&s;ted in the &s;ervice of
France or England. The repre&s;entation which
I had given, was confined to the principles and
practice of the Church of which Origen and
Marcellus were members, before the &s;en&s;e of
public and private intere&s;t had reduced the
lofty &s;tandard of Evangelical perfection to the
ordinary level of human nature. In tho&s;e pri|mitive
times, where are the Chri&s;tian legions
that &s;erved in the Imperial armies? Our Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
Pompeys may &s;tamp with their foot,
but no armed men will ari&s;e out of the earth,
except the gho&s;ts of the Thundering and the

Thebaean legions, the former renowned for a
Miracle, and the latter for a Martyrdom.
Either the two Prote&s;tant Doctors mu&s;t acqui|e&s;ce
under &s;ome imputations which are better
under&s;tood than expre&s;&s;ed, or they mu&s;t pre|pare,
in the full light and freedom of the eigh|teenth
century, to undertake the defence of
two ob&s;olete legends, the lea&s;t ab&s;urd of which
&s;taggered the well-di&s;ciplined credulity of a
Franci&s;can Friar. (See Pagi Critic. ad Annal.

different was the &s;pirit and ta&s;te of the learned

<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHARAC|TER AND CREDIT OF EUSE|BIUS.</NOTE>
<P>A grave and pathetic complaint is introduced
by Dr. Chel&s;um, into his preface<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">P. ii, iii.</NOTE>, that Mr.
Gibbon, who has often referred to the Fathers
of the Church, &s;eems to have entertained a ge|neral
di&s;tru&s;t of tho&s;e re&s;pectable witne&s;&s;es.
The Critic is &s;candalized at the epithets of
&s;canty and <HI>&s;u&s;picious,</HI> which are applied to the
materials of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory; and if he
cannot impeach the truth of the former, he
cen&s;ures in the mo&s;t angry terms the inju&s;tice
of the latter. He a&s;&s;umes, with peculiar
zeal, the defence of Eu&s;ebius, the venerable
parent of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, and labours to
re&s;cue his character from the <HI>gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;en|tation,</HI>
on which Mr. Gibbon has openly in|&s;i&s;ted<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Chel&s;um and Randolph, p. 220&mdash;238.</NOTE>. He ob&s;erves, as if he &s;agaciou&s;ly
fore&s;aw the objection, <Q REND="inline">That it will not be
&s;ufficient here to alledge a few in&s;tances of
apparent credulity in &s;ome of the Fathers,
in order to fix a general charge of <HI>&s;u&s;picion</HI>
on all.</Q> But it <HI>may</HI> be &s;ufficient to allege
a clear and fundamental principle of hi&s;torical
as well as legal Critici&s;m, that whenever we
are de&s;titute of the means of comparing the
te&s;timonies of the oppo&s;ite parties, the evidence
<PB N="123" REF="129">
of <HI>any</HI> witne&s;s, however illu&s;trious by his rank
and titles, is ju&s;tly to be <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> in his own
cau&s;e. It is unfortunate enough, that I &s;hould
be engaged with adver&s;aries, whom their ha|bits
of &s;tudy and conver&s;ation appear to have
left in total ignorance of the principles which
univer&s;ally regulate the opinions and practice
of mankind.</P>
<P>As the ancient world was not di&s;tracted by
the fierce conflicts of ho&s;tile &s;ects, the free and
eloquent writers of Greece and Rome had
few opportunities of indulging their pa&s;&s;ions,
or of exerci&s;ing their impartiality in the rela|tion
of religious events. Since the origin of
Theological Factions, &s;ome Hi&s;torians, Am|mianus
Marcellinus, Fra-Paolo, Thuanus,
Hume, and perhaps a few others, have de|&s;erved
the &s;ingular prai&s;e of holding the ba|lance
with a &s;teady and equal hand. Inde|pendent
and unconnected, they contemplated
with the &s;ame indifference, the opinions and
intere&s;ts of the contending parties; or, if they
were &s;eriou&s;ly attached to a particular &s;y&s;tem,
they were armed with a firm and moderate
temper, which enabled them to &s;uppre&s;s their
affections, and to &s;acrifice their re&s;entments.
In this &s;mall, but <HI>venerable</HI> Synod of Hi&s;to|rians,
Eu&s;ebius cannot claim a &s;eat. I had
acknowledged, and I &s;till think, that his cha|racter
<PB N="124" REF="130">
was le&s;s tinctured with credulity than
that of mo&s;t of his contemporaries; but as his
enemies mu&s;t admit that he was &s;incere and
earne&s;t in the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, &s;o the
warme&s;t of his admirers, or at lea&s;t of his
readers, mu&s;t di&s;cern, and will probably ap|plaud,
the religious zeal which di&s;graces or
adorns every page of his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory.
This laborious and u&s;eful work was publi&s;hed
at a time, between the defeat of Licinius and
the Council of Nice, when the re&s;entment of
the Chri&s;tians was &s;till warm, and when the
Pagans were a&s;toni&s;hed and di&s;mayed by the
recent victory and conver&s;ion of the great Con|&s;tantine.
The materials, I &s;hall dare to repeat
the invidious epithets of &s;canty and &s;u&s;picious,
were extracted from the accounts which the
Chri&s;tians them&s;elves had given of their <HI>own</HI>
&s;ufferings, and of the cruelty of their enemies.
The Pagans had &s;o long and &s;o contemptuou&s;ly
neglected the ri&s;ing greatne&s;s of the Church,
that the Bi&s;hop of Cae&s;area had little either to
hope or to fear from the writers of the oppo&s;ite
party; almo&s;t all of that <HI>little</HI> which did exi&s;t,
has been accidentally lo&s;t, or purpo&s;ely de|&s;troyed;
and the candid enquirer may vainly
wi&s;h to compare with the Hi&s;tory of Eu&s;ebius,
&s;ome Heathen narrative of the per&s;ecutions of
Decius and Diocletian. Under the&s;e circum|&s;tances,
it is the duty of an impartial judge to
<PB N="125" REF="131">
be coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner, who is incapabale of
making any defence for him&s;elf; and it is the
fir&s;t office of a coun&s;el to examine with di&s;tru&s;t
and <HI>&s;u&s;picion,</HI> the intere&s;ted evidence of the ac|cu&s;er.
Rea&s;on ju&s;tifies the &s;u&s;picion, and it is
confirmed by the con&s;tant experience of modern
Hi&s;tory, in almo&s;t every in&s;tance where we
have an opportunity of comparing the mutual
complaints and apologies of the religious fac|tions,
who have di&s;turbed each other's happi|ne&s;s
in this world, for the &s;ake of &s;ecuring it
in the next.</P>
<P>As we are deprived of the means of contra&s;t|ing
the adver&s;e relations of the Chri&s;tians and
Pagans; it is the more incumbent on us to
improve the opportunities of trying the narra|tives
of Eu&s;ebius, by the original, and &s;ome|times
occa&s;ional te&s;timonies of the more ancient
writers of his own party. Dr. Chel&s;um<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 653. Chel&s;um, p. 204&mdash;207.</NOTE> has
ob&s;erved, that the celebrated pa&s;&s;age of Ori|gen,
which has &s;o much thinned the ranks of
the army of Martyrs, mu&s;t be confined to the
per&s;ecutions that had already happened. I
cannot di&s;pute this &s;agacious remark, but I
&s;hall venture to add, that this pa&s;&s;age more
immediately relates to the religious tempe&s;ts
which had been excited in the time and coun|try
of Origen; and &s;till more particularly to
<PB N="126" REF="132">
the city of Alexandria, and to the per&s;ecution
of Severus, in which young Origen &s;ucce&s;sfully
exhorted his father, to &s;acrifice his life and
fortune for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t. From &s;uch
unque&s;tionable evidence, I am authori&s;ed to
conclude, that the number of holy victims who
&s;ealed their faith with their blood was not, on
this occa&s;ion, very con&s;iderable: but I cannot
reconcile this fair conclu&s;ion with the po&s;itive
declaration of Eu&s;ebius, (l. vi. c. 2. p. 258)
that at Alexandria, in the per&s;ecution of Seve|rus,
an innumerable, at lea&s;t an indefinite mul|titude
(<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">) of Chri&s;tians were honoured with
the Crown of Martyrdom. The advocates for
Eu&s;ebius may exert their critical &s;kill in prov|ing
that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>many</HI> and <HI>few,</HI> are
&s;ynonymous and convertible terms, but they
will hardly &s;ucceed in dimini&s;hing &s;o palpable
a contradiction, or in removing the &s;u&s;picion
which deeply fixes it&s;elf on the hi&s;torical cha|racter
of the Bi&s;hop of Cae&s;area. This unfor|tunate
experiment taught me to read, with
becoming caution, the loo&s;e and declamatory
&s;tyle which <HI>&s;eems</HI> to magnify the multitude of
Martyrs and Confe&s;&s;ors, and to aggravate the
nature of their &s;ufferings. From the &s;ame
motives I &s;elected, with careful ob&s;ervation,
the more certain account of the number of
per&s;ons who actually &s;uffered death in the pro|vince
<PB N="127" REF="133">
of Pale&s;tine, during the whole eight years
of the la&s;t and mo&s;t rigorous per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the rea&s;onable grounds of &s;u&s;picion,
which &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves to every liberal mind,
again&s;t the credibility of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Hi&s;torians, and of Eu&s;ebius, their venerable
leader, I had taken notice of two very remark|able
pa&s;&s;ages of the Bi&s;hop of Cae&s;area. He
frankly, or at lea&s;t indirectly, declares, that in
treating of the la&s;t per&s;ecution, <Q REND="inline">he has re|lated
whatever might redound to the glory,
and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all that could tend to the
di&s;grace, of Religion<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 699.</NOTE>.</Q> Dr. Chel&s;um, who,
on this occa&s;ion, mo&s;t lamentably exclaims
that we &s;hould hear Eu&s;ebius, before we utter|ly
condemn him, has provided, with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of his worthy colleague, an elaborate
defence for their common patron; and as if he
were &s;ecretly con&s;cious of the weakne&s;s of the
cau&s;e, he has contrived the re&s;ource of in|trenching
him&s;elf in a very muddy &s;oil, behind
three &s;everal fortifications, which do not ex|actly
&s;upport each other. The advocate for
the &s;incerity of Eu&s;ebius maintains: 1&s;t, That
he never made &s;uch a declaration: 2dly, That
he had a right to make it: and, 3dly, That
he did not ob&s;erve it. The&s;e &s;eparate and

fair Interpreter; nor &s;hall I refu&s;e to re&s;t the
proof of my fidelity on the tran&s;lation of tho&s;e
two pa&s;&s;ages of Eu&s;ebius, which Dr. Chel&s;um
produces in his favour<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">P. 228. 231.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline">But it is not our

We therefore have not been induced to

who were &s;unk of their own accord in the

the judgment and candour of my readers, if I
added a &s;ingle reflection on the clear and ob|vious

a privilege of a &s;till more dangerous and

our ideas of the duties and the privileges of an

<PB N="131" REF="141">
is alleged, that <Q REND="inline">every writer has a right to
chu&s;e his &s;ubject, for the particular benefit
of his reader; that he has explained his own

according to it, not as a complete hi&s;torian
of the times, but rather as a <HI>didactic</HI> writer,
who&s;e main object is to make his work like
the Scriptures them&s;elves, PROFITABLE FOR

of the Church, the plan is at lea&s;t ex|cu&s;able,
perhaps peculiarly proper; and that
he has conformed him&s;elf to the principal
duty of an hi&s;torian, while, according to his
immediate de&s;ign, he has not particularly
related any of the tran&s;actions which could
tend to the di&s;grace of religion<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Chel&s;um, p. 229, 230, 231.</NOTE>.</Q> The
hi&s;torian mu&s;t indeed be generous, who will
conceal, by his own di&s;grace, that of his coun|try,
or of his religion. Whatever &s;ubject he
has cho&s;en, whatever per&s;ons he introduces, he
owes to him&s;elf, to the pre&s;ent age, and to
po&s;terity, a ju&s;t and perfect delineation of all
that may be prai&s;ed, of all that may be ex|cu&s;ed,
and of all that mu&s;t be cen&s;ured. If he
fails in the di&s;charge of his important office, he
partially violates the &s;acred obligations of truth,
and di&s;appoints his readers of the in&s;truction
<PB N="132" REF="142">
which they might have derived from a fair
parallel of the vices and virtues of the mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious
characters. Herodotus might range
without controul in the &s;pacious walks of the
Greek and Barbaric domain, and Thucydides
might confine his &s;teps to the narrow path of
the Peloponne&s;ian war; but tho&s;e hi&s;torians
would never have de&s;erved the e&s;teem of po&s;te|rity,
if they had de&s;ignedly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed or tran|&s;iently
mentioned tho&s;e facts which could tend
to the di&s;grace of Greece or of Athens. The&s;e
unalterable dictates of con&s;cience and rea&s;on
have been <HI>&s;eldom</HI> que&s;tioned, though they have
been &s;eldom ob&s;erved; and we mu&s;t &s;incerely
join in the hone&s;t complaint of Melchior Ca|nus,
<Q REND="inline">that the lives of the philo&s;ophers have
been compo&s;ed by Laertius, and tho&s;e of
the Cae&s;ars by Suetonius, with a much
&s;tricter and more &s;evere regard for hi&s;toric
truth, than can be found in the lives of

Catholic writers.</Q> (See Loci Communes,
l. xi. p. 650, apud Clericum, Epi&s;tol. Critic. v.

truth is of far more pernicious con&s;equence in
eccle&s;ia&s;tical than in civil hi&s;tory. If Laertius
had concealed the defects of Plato, or if Sue|tonius
had di&s;gui&s;ed the vices of Augu&s;tus, we
&s;hould have been deprived of the knowledge
<PB N="133" REF="143">
of &s;ome curious, and perhaps in&s;tructive facts,
and our idea of tho&s;e celebrated men might
have been more favourable than they de&s;erved;
but I cannot di&s;cover any practical inconve|niencies
which could have been the re&s;ult of
our ignorance. But if Eu&s;ebius had fairly and
circum&s;tantially related the &s;candalous di&s;&s;en|tions
of the Confe&s;&s;ors; if he had &s;hewn that
their virtues were tinctured with pride and
ob&s;tinacy, and that their lively faith was not
exempt from &s;ome mixture of enthu&s;ia&s;m; he
would have armed his readers again&s;t the ex|ce&s;&s;ive
veneration for tho&s;e holy men, which
imperceptibly degenerated into religious wor|&s;hip.
The &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e <HI>didactic</HI> hi&s;tories,
by concealing or palliating every circum&s;tance
of human infirmity, was one of the mo&s;t effi|cacious
means of con&s;ecrating the memory, the
bones, and the writings of the &s;aints of the pre|vailing
party; and a great part of the errors
and corruptions of the Church of Rome may
fairly be a&s;cribed to this criminal di&s;&s;imulation
of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;torians. As a Prote&s;tant
Divine, Dr. Chel&s;um mu&s;t abhor the&s;e corrup|tions;
but as a Chri&s;tian, he &s;hould be careful
le&s;t his apology for the prudent choice of Eu&s;e|bius
&s;hould &s;ix an indirect cen&s;ure on the un|re&s;erved
&s;incerity of the four Evangeli&s;ts. In|&s;tead
of confining their narrative to tho&s;e things
<PB N="134" REF="144">
which are virtuous and of good report, in&s;tead of
following the plan which is here recommended
as <HI>peculiarly proper</HI> for the affairs of the Church,
the in&s;pired writers have thought it their duty
to relate the mo&s;t minute circum&s;tances of the
fall of St. Peter, without con&s;idering whether
the behaviour of an Apo&s;tle, who thrice de|nied
his Divine Ma&s;ter, might redound to the
honour or to the di&s;grace of Chri&s;tianity. If
Dr. Chel&s;um &s;hould be frightened by this un|expected
con&s;equence, if he &s;hould be de&s;irous
of &s;aving his faith from <HI>utter &s;hipwreck,</HI> by
throwing over-board the u&s;ele&s;s lumber of me|mory
and reflection, I am not enough his ene|my
to impede the &s;ucce&s;s of his hone&s;t endea|vours.</P>
<P>The didactic method of writing hi&s;tory is &s;till
more profitably exerci&s;ed by Eu&s;ebius in ano|ther
work, which he has intitled, The Life of
Con&s;tantine, his gracious patron and benefac|tor.
Prie&s;ts and poets have enjoyed in every
age a privilege of flattery; but if the actions
of Con&s;tantine are compared with the perfect
idea of a royal &s;aint, which, under his name,
has been delineated by the zeal and gratitude
of Eu&s;ebius, the mo&s;t indulgent reader will
confe&s;s, that when I &s;tyled him a <HI>courtly Bi|&s;hop</HI><NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">.</NOTE>, I could only be re&s;trained by my re&s;pect
<PB N="135" REF="145">
for the epi&s;copal character from the u&s;e of a
much har&s;her epithet. The other appellation
of a <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate declaimer,</HI> which &s;eems to have
&s;ounded &s;till more offen&s;ive in the tender ears
of Dr. Chel&s;um<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Chel&s;um, p. 234.</NOTE>, was not applied by me to
Eu&s;ebius, but to Lactantius, or rather to the
author of the hi&s;torical declamation, <HI>De mor|tibus
per&s;ecutorum</HI>; and indeed it is much more
properly adapted to the Rhetorician, than to
the Bi&s;hop. Each of tho&s;e authors was alike
&s;tudious of the glory of Con&s;tantine; but each
of them directed the torrent of his invectives
again&s;t the tyrant, whether Maxentius or Lici|nus,
who&s;e recent defeat was the actual theme
of popular and Chri&s;tian applau&s;e. This &s;imple
ob&s;ervation may &s;erve to extingui&s;h a very
trifling objection of my critic, That Eu&s;ebius
has not repre&s;ented the tyrant Maxentius under
the character of a Per&s;ecutor.</P>
<P>Without &s;crutinizing the con&s;iderations of
intere&s;t which might &s;upport the integrity of
Baronius and Tillemont, I may fairly ob&s;erve,
that both tho&s;e learned Catholics have ac|knowledged
and condemned the di&s;&s;imulation
of Eu&s;ebius, which is partly denied, and partly
ju&s;tified, by my adver&s;ary. The honourable
reflection of Baronius well de&s;erves to be tran|&s;cribed.

the unfortunate declaration of his partial de|&s;ign,
perhaps he had a right to make it; but
at lea&s;t his accu&s;er mu&s;t admit, that he has
&s;aved his honour by not keeping his word;

OF MANNERS AND PRINCIPLES among
the Chri&s;tians, &s;o FORCIBLY LAMENTED by Eu|&s;ebius<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Chel&s;um, p. 226, 227.</NOTE>. He has indeed indulged him&s;elf in a
&s;train of <HI>loo&s;e</HI> and <HI>indefinite</HI> cen&s;ure, which may
generally be ju&s;t, and which cannot be per|&s;onally
<PB N="137" REF="147">
offen&s;ive, which is alike incapable of
wounding or of correcting, as it &s;eems to have
no fixed object or certain aim. Juvenal might
have read his &s;atire again&s;t women in a circle
of Roman ladies, and each of them might have
li&s;tened with plea&s;ure to the amu&s;ing de&s;crip|tion
of the various vices and follies, from
which &s;he her&s;elf was &s;o perfectly free. The
morali&s;t, the preacher, the eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;to|rian,
enjoy a &s;till more ample latitude of in|vective;
and as long as they ab&s;tain from any
particular cen&s;ure, they may &s;ecurely expo&s;e,
and even exaggerate, the &s;ins of the multitude.
The precepts of Chri&s;tianity &s;eem to inculcate
a &s;tyle of mortification, of aba&s;ement, of &s;elf|contempt;
and the hypocrite who a&s;pires to
the reputation of a &s;aint, often finds it conve|nient
to affect the language of a penitent. I
&s;hould doubt whether Dr. Chel&s;um is much
acquainted with the comedies of Moliere. If
he has ever read that inimitable ma&s;ter of hu|man
life, he may recollect whether Tartu&s;&s;e
was very much inclined to confe&s;s his real guilt,
when he exclaimed,

<P>It is not my intention to compare the cha|racter
of Tartuffe with that of Eu&s;ebius; the
former pointed his invectives again&s;t him&s;elf,
the latter directed them again&s;t the times in
which he had lived: but as the prudent Bi&s;hop
of Cae&s;area did not &s;pecify any place or per&s;on
for the object of his cen&s;ure, he cannot ju&s;tly
be accu&s;ed, even by his friends, of violating
the <HI>profitable</HI> plan of his <HI>didactic</HI> hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The extreme caution of Eu&s;ebius, who de|clines
any mention of tho&s;e who were tempted
and who fell during the per&s;ecution, has coun|tenanced
a &s;u&s;picion that he him&s;elf was one of
tho&s;e unhappy victims, and that his tenderne&s;s
for the wounded fame of his brethren aro&s;e
from a ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion of his own di&s;grace.
In one of my notes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 699, N. 178.</NOTE>, I had ob&s;erved, that he
was charged with the guilt of &s;ome criminal
compliances, in his own pre&s;ence, and in the
Council of Tyre. I am therefore accountable
for the reality only, and not for the truth, of
the accu&s;ation: but as the two Doctors, who
<PB N="139" REF="149">
on this occa&s;ion unite their forces, are angry
and clamorous in a&s;&s;erting the innocence of the
Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;torian<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Chel&s;um and Randolph, p. 236, 237, 238.</NOTE>, I &s;hall advance one
&s;tep farther, and &s;hall maintain, that the charge
again&s;t Eu&s;ebius, though not legally proved,
is &s;upported by a rea&s;onable &s;hare of pre|&s;umptive
evidence.</P>
<P>I have often wondered why our orthodox
Divines &s;hould be &s;o earne&s;t and zealous in the
defence of Eu&s;ebius; who&s;e moral character
cannot be pre&s;erved, unle&s;s by the &s;acrifice of
a more illu&s;trious, and, as I really believe, of
a more innocent victim. Either the Bi&s;hop of
Cae&s;area, on a very important occa&s;ion, vio|lated
the laws of Chri&s;tian charity and civil
ju&s;tice, or we mu&s;t fix a charge of calumny,
almo&s;t of forgery, on the head of the great
Athana&s;ius, the &s;tandard-bearer of the Ho|moou&s;ian
cau&s;e, and the firme&s;t pillar of the
orthodox doctrine. In the Council of Tyre,
he was accu&s;ed of murdering, or at lea&s;t of
mutilating, a Bi&s;hop, whom he produced at
Tyre alive and unhurt (Athana&s;. tom. i.
p. 783. 786.); and of &s;acrilegiou&s;ly breaking
a con&s;ecrated chalice, in a village where nei|ther
church, nor altar, nor chalice, could po&s;|&s;ibly
have exi&s;ted. (Athana&s;. tom. i. p. 731,
<PB N="140" REF="150">
732. 802.) Notwith&s;tanding the cleare&s;t proofs
of his innocence, Athana&s;ius was oppre&s;&s;ed by
the Arian faction; and Eu&s;ebius of Cae&s;area,
the venerable father of eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory,
conducted this iniquitous pro&s;ecution from a
motive of per&s;onal enmity. (Athana&s;. tom. i.
p. 728. 795. 797.) Four years afterwards, a
national council of the Bi&s;hops of Egypt, forty-nine
of whom had been pre&s;ent at the Synod of
Tyre, addre&s;&s;ed an epi&s;tle or manife&s;to in fa|vour
of Athana&s;ius to all the Bi&s;hops of the
Chri&s;tian world. In this epi&s;tle they a&s;&s;ert,
that &s;ome of the Confe&s;&s;ors, who accompanied
them to Tyre, had accu&s;ed Eu&s;ebius of Cae&s;a|rea
of an act relative to idolatrous &s;acrifice.
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> (Atha|na&s;.
tom. i. p. 728.) Be&s;ides this &s;hort and
authentic memorial, which e&s;caped the know|ledge
or the candour of our confederate Doc|tors,
a con&s;onant but more circum&s;tantial nar|rative
of the accu&s;ation of Eu&s;ebius may be
found in the writings of Epiphanius (Haere&s;.
lxviii. p. 723, 724.), the learned Bi&s;hop of
Salamis, who was born about the time of the
Synod of Tyre. He relates, that, in one of the
&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Council, Potamon, Bi&s;hop of
Heracica in Egypt, addre&s;&s;ed Eu&s;ebius in the
following words: <Q REND="inline">How now, Eu&s;ebius, can
<PB N="141" REF="151">
this be borne, that you &s;hould be &s;eated as
a judge, while the innocent Athana&s;ius
is left &s;tanding as a criminal? Tell me,
continued Potamon, were we not in pri&s;on
together during the per&s;ecution? For my
own part, I lo&s;t an eye for the &s;ake of the
truth; but I cannot di&s;cern that <HI>you</HI> have
lo&s;t any one of your members. You bear
not any marks of your &s;ufferings for Je&s;us
Chri&s;t; but here you are, full of life, and
with all the parts of your body &s;ound and
entire. How could you contrive to e&s;cape
from pri&s;on, unle&s;s you &s;tained your con|&s;cience,
either by actual guilt or by a cri|minal
promi&s;e to our per&s;ecutors.</Q> Eu&s;e|bius
immediately broke up the meeting, and
di&s;covered by his anger, that he was confound|ed
or provoked by the reproaches of the Con|fe&s;&s;or
Potamon.</P>
<P>I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf, if I were capable of
magnifying, for a pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, the autho|rity
of the witne&s;s whom I have produced. Po|tamon
was mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly actuated by a &s;trong
prejudice again&s;t the per&s;onal enemy of his Pri|mate;
and if the tran&s;action to which he al|luded
had been of a private and doubtful kind,
I would not take any ungenerous advantage
of the re&s;pect which my Reverend Adver&s;aries
mu&s;t entertain for the character of a Confe&s;&s;or.
<PB N="142" REF="152">
But I cannot di&s;tru&s;t the veracity of Potamon,
when he confined him&s;elf to the a&s;&s;ertion of a
fact, which lay within the compa&s;s of his per|&s;onal
knowledge: and collateral te&s;timony (&s;ee
Photius, p. 296, 297.) atte&s;ts, that Eu&s;ebius
was long enough in pri&s;on to a&s;&s;i&s;t his friend,
the Martyr Pamphilus, in compo&s;ing the fir&s;t
five books of his Apology for Origen. If we
admit that Eu&s;ebius was impri&s;oned, he mu&s;t
have been di&s;charged, and his di&s;charge mu&s;t
have been either honourable, or criminal, or
innocent. If his patience vanqui&s;hed the cruelty
of the Tyrant's Mini&s;ters, a &s;hort relation of his
own confe&s;&s;ion and &s;ufferings would have formed
an u&s;eful and edifying Chapter in his Didactic
Hi&s;tory of the Per&s;ecution of Pale&s;tine; and
the Reader would have been &s;atisfied of the
veracity of an Hi&s;torian who valued truth above
his life. If it had been in his power to ju&s;tify,
or even to excu&s;e, the manner of his di&s;charge
from pri&s;on, it was his intere&s;t, it was his duty,
to prevent the doubts and &s;u&s;picions which
mu&s;t ari&s;e from his &s;ilence under the&s;e delicate
circum&s;tances. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e urgent
rea&s;ons, Eu&s;ebius has ob&s;erved a profound, and
perhaps a prudent, &s;ilence: though he fre|quently
celebrates the merit and martyrdom
of his friend Pamphilus (p. 371. 394. 419. 427.
Edit. Cantab.), he never in&s;inuates that he was
<PB N="143" REF="153">
his companion in pri&s;on; and while he copi|ou&s;ly
de&s;cribes the eight years per&s;ecution in
Pale&s;tine, he never repre&s;ents him&s;elf in any
other light than of a &s;pectator. Such a con|duct
in a Writer, who relates with a vi&s;ible &s;a|tisfaction
the honourable events of his own life,
if it be not ab&s;olutely con&s;idered as an evi|dence
of con&s;cious guilt, mu&s;t excite, and may
ju&s;tify, the &s;u&s;picions of the mo&s;t candid Critic.</P>
<P>Yet the firmne&s;s of Dr. Randolph is not
&s;haken by the&s;e rational &s;u&s;picions; and he
conde&s;cends, in a magi&s;terial tone, to inform
me, <Q REND="inline">That it is highly improbable, from the
general well-known deci&s;ion of the Church
in &s;uch ca&s;es, that had his apo&s;tacy been
known, he would have ri&s;en to tho&s;e high
honours which he attained, or been admitted
at all indeed to any other than lay-com|munion.</Q>
This weighty objection did not
&s;urprize me, as I had already &s;een the &s;ub&s;tance
of it in the Prolegomena of Vale&s;ius; but I
&s;afely di&s;regarded a difficulty which had not
appeared of any moment to the national coun|cil
of Egypt; and I &s;till think that an hundred
Bi&s;hops, with Athana&s;ius at their head, were
as competent judges of the di&s;cipline of the
fourth Century, as even the Lady Margaret's
Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity in the Univer&s;ity of Ox|ford.
As a work of &s;upererogation, I have
<PB N="144" REF="154">
con&s;ulted, however, the Antiquities of Bing|ham
(&s;ee l. iv. c. 3. &s;. 6, 7. vol. i. p. 144, &amp;c.
fol. Edit.), and found, as I expected, that
much real learning had made him cautious and
mode&s;t. After a careful examination of the
facts and authorities already known to me, and
of tho&s;e with which I was &s;upplied by the di|ligent
Antiquarian, I am per&s;uaded that the
theory and the practice of di&s;cipline were not
invariably the &s;ame, that particular examples
cannot always be reconciled with general
rules, and that the &s;tern laws of ju&s;tice often
yielded to motives of policy and convenience.
The temper of Jerom towards tho&s;e whom he
con&s;idered as Heretics was fierce and unfor|giving;
yet the Dialogue of Jerom again&s;t the
Luciferians, which I have read with infinite
plea&s;ure (tom. ii. p. 135&mdash;147. Edit. Ba&s;il.
1536.), is the &s;ea&s;onable and dextrous per|formance
of a State&s;man, who felt the expe|diency
of &s;oothing and reconciling a numerous
party of offenders. The mo&s;t rigid di&s;cipline,
with regard to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tics who had fallen
in time of per&s;ecution, is expre&s;&s;ed in the 10th
Canon of the Council of Nice; the mo&s;t re|markable
indulgence was &s;hewn by the Fathers
of the &s;ame Council to the <HI>lap&s;ed,</HI> the degraded,
the &s;chi&s;matic Bi&s;hops of Lycopolis. Of the
penitent &s;inners, &s;ome might e&s;cape the &s;hame
<PB N="145" REF="155">
of a public conviction or confe&s;&s;ion, and others
might be exempted from the rigour of cle|rical
puni&s;hment. If Eu&s;ebius incurred the
guilt of a &s;acrilegious promi&s;e (for we are free
to accept the milder alternative of Potamon),
the proofs of this criminal tran&s;action might
be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the influence of money or fa|vour;
a &s;ea&s;onable journey into Egypt might
allow time for the popular rumours to &s;ub&s;ide.
The crime of Eu&s;ebius might be protected by
the impunity of many Epi&s;copal Apo&s;tates
(&s;ee Philo&s;torg. l. ii. c. 15. p. 21. Edit. Go|thofred.);
and the Governors of the Church
very rea&s;onably de&s;ired to retain in their &s;er|vice
the mo&s;t learned Chri&s;tian of the Age.</P>

<P>WHILE the &s;heets of this Vindication
were in the pre&s;s, I was informed that
an anonymous pamphlet, under the title of <HI>A
Few Remarks,</HI> &amp;c. had been publi&s;hed again&s;t
my Hi&s;tory in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t &s;ummer.
The unknown writer has thought proper to di|&s;tingui&s;h
him&s;elf by the emphatic, yet vague,
appellation of A GENTLEMAN: but I mu&s;t la|ment
that he has not con&s;idered, with becoming
attention, the duties of that re&s;pectable charac|ter.
I am ignorant of the motives which can
urge a man of a liberal mind, and liberal man|ners,
to attack without provocation, and with|out
tenderne&s;s, any work which may have con|tributed
to the information, or even to the
amu&s;ement of the public. But I am well con|vinced,
that the author of &s;uch a work, who
boldly gives his name and his labours to the
world, impo&s;es on his adver&s;aries the fair and
honourable obligation of encountering him in
open day-light, and of &s;upporting the weight
of their a&s;&s;ertions by the credit of their names.
<PB N="148" REF="158">
The effu&s;ions of wit, or the productions of rea|&s;on,

and the guilty blu&s;h of detection.</P>
<P>After this remark, which I cannot make
without &s;ome degree of concern, I &s;hall frankly
declare, that it is not my wi&s;h or my inten|tion

the mind of my Adver&s;ary. He fondly

Pilate<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. 100.</NOTE>), which can &s;carcely find a
&s;helter in the gloom of an Italian convent; and
the re&s;entment which he points again&s;t me,
might frequently be extended to the mo&s;t en|lightened
of the PROTESTANT, or, in his opi|nion,
of the HERETICAL critics. His ob&s;erva|tions
are divided into a number of unconnected
paragraphs, each of which contains &s;ome quo|tation
from my Hi&s;tory, and the angry, yet
commonly trifling expre&s;&s;ion of his di&s;approba|tion

and di&s;plea&s;ure. Tho&s;e &s;entiments I can|not
hope to remove; and as the religious opi|nions
of this <HI>Gentleman</HI> are principally founded
on the infallibility of the Church<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Remarks p. 15.</NOTE>, they are
not calculated to make a very deep impre&s;&s;ion
on the mind of an Engli&s;h reader. The view of
<HI>facts</HI> will be materially affected by the conta|gious

The devout Papi&s;t, who has implored
on his knees the interce&s;&s;ion of St. Cyprian,
will &s;eldom pre&s;ume to examine the actions of
the Saint by the rules of hi&s;torical evidence and
of moral propriety. In&s;tead of the homely
likene&s;s which I had exhibited of the Bi&s;hop of
Carthage, my Adver&s;ary has &s;ub&s;tituted a life
of Cyprian<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 72&mdash;88.</NOTE>, full of what the French call
<HI>onction,</HI> and the Engli&s;h, <HI>canting</HI> (See Jortin's

only reply, that tho&s;e who are di&s;&s;atisfied with

<P>It would be an <HI>endle&s;s</HI> di&s;cu&s;&s;ion (<HI>endle&s;s</HI> in

cavils which &s;tart up and expire in every page
<PB N="150" REF="160">
of this critici&s;m, on the inexhau&s;tible topic of
opinions, characters, and intentions. Mo&s;t of
the in&s;tances which are here produced, are of
&s;o brittle a &s;ub&s;tance that they fall in pieces as
&s;oon as they are touched: and I &s;earched for
&s;ome time before I was able to di&s;cover an ex|ample
of &s;ome moment where the <HI>Gentleman</HI>
had fairly &s;taked his veracity again&s;t &s;ome po|&s;itive
fact a&s;&s;erted in the two la&s;t Chapters of
my Hi&s;tory. At la&s;t I perceived that he has
ab&s;olutely denied<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. 90, 91.</NOTE> that any thing can be ga|thered
from the Epi&s;tles of St. Cyprian, or from
his treati&s;e <HI>De Unitate Eccle&s;iae,</HI> to which I had
referred, to ju&s;tify my account of the &s;piritual
pride and licentious manners of &s;ome of the
Confe&s;&s;ors<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 661, Note 91.</NOTE>. As the <HI>numbers</HI> of the Epi&s;tles
are not the &s;ame in the edition of Pamelius and
in that of Fell, the Critic may be excu&s;ed for
mi&s;taking my quotations, if he will acknow|ledge
that he was ignorant of eccle&s;ia&s;tical
hi&s;tory, and that he never heard of the troubles
excited by the &s;piritual pride of the Confe&s;&s;ors,
who u&s;urped the privilege of giving letters of
communion to penitent &s;inners. But my re|ference
to the treati&s;e <HI>De Unitate Eccle&s;iae</HI> was
clear and direct; the treati&s;e it&s;elf contains
only ten pages, and the following words might
be di&s;tinctly read by any per&s;on who under|&s;tood
the Latin language. "Nec qui&s;quam
<PB N="151" REF="161">
miretur, dilecti&s;&s;imi fratres, etiam de confe&s;&s;o|ribus
quo&s;dam ad i&s;ta procedere, inde quoque
aliquos tam nefanda tam gravia peccare. Ne|que
enim confe&s;&s;io immunem facit ab in&s;idiis
diaboli; aut contra tentationes, et pericula, et
incur&s;us atque impetus &s;eculares adhuc in &s;e|culo

<HI>&s;tupra,</HI> et <HI>adulteria</HI> po&s;tmodum videremus, quae
nunc in quibu&s;dam videntes ingemi&s;cimus et
dolemus." This formal declaration of Cyprian,
which is followed by &s;everal long periods of
admonition and cen&s;ure, is alone &s;ufficient to
expo&s;e the &s;candalous vices of &s;ome of the Con|fe&s;&s;ors,
and the di&s;ingenuous behaviour of my
concealed adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>After this example, which I have fairly
cho&s;en as one of the mo&s;t &s;pecious and import|ant
of his objections, the candid Reader would
excu&s;e me, if from this moment I declined <HI>the
Gentleman</HI>'s acquaintance. But as two topics
have occurred, which are intimately connected
with the &s;ubject of the preceding &s;heets, I &s;hall
in&s;ert them in this place, and de&s;ire that they
may be read as the conclu&s;ion of the fourth
article of my an&s;wers to Mr. Davis, and of the
fir&s;t article of my reply to the confederate Doc|tors,
Chel&s;um and Randolph.</P>

<P>I &s;tand accu&s;ed, though not indeed by Mr.
Davis, for profanely depreciating the <HI>promi&s;ed</HI>
Land, as well as the <HI>cho&s;en</HI> People. The Gentle|man
without a name has placed this charge
in the front of his battle<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. 1.</NOTE>, and if my memory
does not deceive me, it is one of the few re|marks
in Mr. Apthorpe's book, which have
any immediate relation to my Hi&s;tory. They
&s;eem to con&s;ider as a reproach, and as an un|ju&s;t
reproach, the idea which I had given of
Pale&s;tine, as of a territory &s;carcely &s;uperior to
Wales in extent and fertility<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 30.</NOTE>; and they
&s;trangely convert a geographical ob&s;ervation
into a theological error. When I recollect
that the imputation of a &s;imilar error was em|ployed
by the implacable Calvin, to precipi|tate
and to ju&s;tify the execution of Servetus,
I mu&s;t applaud the felicity of this country, and
of this age, which has di&s;armed, if it could
not mollify, the fiercene&s;s of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cri|tici&s;m
(&s;ee Dictionnaire Critique de Chauffepi&eacute;,
tom. iv. p. 223).</P>
<P>As I had compared the narrow extent of
Phoenicia and Pale&s;tine with the important ble&s;|fings
which tho&s;e celebrated countries had dif|fu&s;ed
over the re&s;t of the earth, their minute &s;ize
<PB N="153" REF="163">
became an object not of cen&s;ure but of prai&s;e.
<Q>Ingentes animos angu&s;to in pectore ver&s;ant.</Q>
The preci&s;e mea&s;ure of Pale&s;tine was taken
from Templeman's Survey of the Globe: he
allows to Wales 7011 &s;quare Engli&s;h miles, to
the Morea, or Peloponne&s;us, 7220, to the Se|ven
United Provinces 7546, and to Judaea or
Pale&s;tine 7600. The difference is not very
con&s;iderable, and if any of the&s;e countries has
been magnified beyond its real &s;ize, A&s;ia is
more liable than Europe to have been affected
by the inaccuracy of Mr. Templeman's maps.
To the authority of this modern &s;urvey, I &s;hall
only add the ancient and weighty te&s;timony of
Jerom, who pa&s;&s;ed in Pale&s;tine above thirty
years of his life. From Dan to Ber&s;hebah, the
two fixed and proverbial boundaries of the Holy
Land, he reckons no more than one hundred
and &s;ixty miles (Hieronym. ad Dardanum,
tom. iii. p. 66), and the breadth of Pale&s;tine
cannot by any expedient be &s;tretched to one
half of its length (&s;ee Reland, Pale&s;tin. l. ii.
c. 5. p. 421).</P>
<P>The degrees and limits of fertility cannot
be a&s;certained with the &s;trict &s;implicity of geo|graphical
mea&s;ures. Whenever we &s;peak of
the productions of the earth in different cli|mates,
our ideas mu&s;t be relative, our expre&s;|&s;ions
vague and doubtful; nor can we always
<PB N="154" REF="164">
di&s;tingui&s;h between the gifts of Nature and
the rewards of Indu&s;try. The Emperor Fre|derick
II. the enemy and the victim of the
Clergy, is accu&s;ed of &s;aying, after his return
from his Cru&s;ade, that the God of the Jews
would have de&s;pi&s;ed his promi&s;ed land, if he
had once &s;een the fruitful realms of Sicily
and Naples (&s;ee Giannone I&s;toria Civile del
Regno di Napoli, tom. ii. p. 245). This raillery,
which malice has perhaps fal&s;ely imputed to
Frederick, is incon&s;i&s;tent with truth and piety;
yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the &s;oil of Pale|&s;tine
does not contain that inexhau&s;tible, and
as it were &s;pontaneous principle of &s;ecundity
which under the mo&s;t unfavourable circum|&s;tance
has covered with rich harve&s;ts the banks
of the Nile, the fields of Sicily, or the plains
of Poland. The Jordan is the only navigable
river of Pale&s;tine: a con&s;iderable part of the
narrow &s;pace is occupied, or rather lo&s;t, in the
<HI>Dead Sea,</HI> who&s;e horrid a&s;pect in&s;pires every
&s;en&s;ation of di&s;gu&s;t, and countenances every
tale of horror. The di&s;tricts which border on
Arabia partake of the &s;andy quality of the ad|jacent
de&s;ert. The face of the country, except
the &s;ea-coa&s;t and the valley of the Jordan, is
covered with mountains, which appear for the
mo&s;t part as naked and barren rocks; and in
the neighbourhood of Jeru&s;alem there is a real
<PB N="155" REF="165">
&s;carcity of the two elements of earth and wa|ter
(&s;ee Maundrel's Travels, p. 65, and Re|land
Pale&s;tin. tom. i. p. 238&mdash;395). The&s;e
di&s;advantages, which now operate in their
fulle&s;t extent, were formerly corrected by the
labours of a numerous people, and the active
protection of a wi&s;e government. The hills
were cloathed with rich beds of artificial mould,
the rain was collected in va&s;t ci&s;terns, a &s;up|ply
of fre&s;h water was conveyed by pipes and
aqueducts to the dry lands, the breed of cattle
was encouraged in tho&s;e parts which were not
adapted for tillage, and almo&s;t every &s;pot was
compelled to yield &s;ome production for the u&s;e
of the inhabitants. (See the &s;ame te&s;timonies
and ob&s;ervations of Maundrel and Reland).<Q><L>&mdash;Pater ip&s;e colendi</L>
<L>Haud facilem e&s;&s;e viam voluit, primu&s;que per artem</L>
<L>Movit agros; curis acuens mortalia corda</L>
<L>Nec torpere gravi pa&s;&s;us SUA REGNA veterno.</L></Q> Such are the u&s;eful victories which have been
atchieved by MAN on the lofty mountains of
Switzerland, along the rocky coa&s;t of Genoa,
and upon the barren hills of Pale&s;tine; and
&s;ince Wales has flouri&s;hed under the influence
of Engli&s;h freedom, that rugged country has
&s;urely acquired &s;ome &s;hare of the &s;ame indu&s;|trious
merit and the &s;ame artificial fertility.

Tho&s;e Critics who interpret the compari&s;on of
Pale&s;tine and Wales as a tacit libel on the for|mer,
are them&s;elves guilty of an unju&s;t &s;atire
again&s;t the latter of tho&s;e countries. Such is
the inju&s;tice of Mr. Apthorpe and of the ano|nymous
<HI>Gentleman:</HI> but if Mr. Davis (as we

<P>Yet I &s;hall not attempt to conceal a formi|dable
army of Chri&s;tians and even of Martyrs,
which is ready to inli&s;t under the banners of the
confederate Doctors, if they will accept their
&s;ervice. As a &s;pecimen of the extravagant
legends of the middle age, I had produced the
in&s;tance of ten thou&s;and Chri&s;tian &s;oldiers &s;up|po&s;ed
to have been crucified on Mount Ararat,
by the order either of Trajan or Hadrian<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, p. 654. note 74.</NOTE>.
For the mention and for the confutation of this
&s;tory, I had appealed to a Papi&s;t and a Pro|te&s;tant,
to the learned Tillemont (Mem. Ec|cle&s;ia&s;t.
tom. ii. part ii. p. 438), and to the
diligent Geddes (Mi&s;cellanies, vol. ii. p. 203),
and when Tillemont was not afraid to &s;ay that
there are few hi&s;tories which appear more fa|bulous,
<PB N="157" REF="167">
I was not a&s;hamed of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the <HI>Fa|ble</HI>
with &s;ilent contempt. We may trace the de|grees
of fiction as well as tho&s;e of credibility, and
the impartial Critic will not place on the &s;ame
level the bapti&s;m of Philip and the donation of
Con&s;tantine. But in con&s;idering the crucifix|ion
of the ten thou&s;and Chri&s;tian &s;oldiers, we
are not reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of weighing
any internal probabilities, or of di&s;proving any
external te&s;timonies. This legend, the ab|&s;urdity
of which mu&s;t &s;trike every <HI>rational</HI> mind,
&s;tands naked and un&s;upported by the authority
of any writer who lived within a thou&s;and years
of the age of Trajan, and has not been able to
obtain the poor &s;anction of the uncorrupted
Martyrologies which were framed in the mo&s;t
credulous period of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory.
The two Prote&s;tant Doctors will probably re|ject
the un&s;ub&s;tantial pre&s;ent which has been
offered them; yet there is one of my adver&s;a|ries,
the <HI>annonymous Gentleman,</HI> who boldly de|clares
