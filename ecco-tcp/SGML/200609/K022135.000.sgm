<HEAD>ESSAY I. Of the different Species of PHILOSOPHY.</HEAD>
<P>MORAL Philo&s;ophy, or the Science of hu|man Nature, may be treated after two different Manners; each of which has its peculiar Merit, and may contribute to the Entertainment, In&s;truction, and Reformation of Man|kind. The one con&s;iders Man chiefly as born for Action; and as influenc'd in his Actions by Ta&s;te and Sentiment; pur&s;uing one Object and avoiding an|other, according to the Value, which the&s;e Objects &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and according to the Light, in which they pre&s;ent them&s;elves. Virtue, of all Objects, is the mo&s;t valuable and lovely; and accordingly this Species of Philo&s;ophers paint her in the mo&s;t amiable Colours, borrowing all Helps from Poetry and Elo|quence, and treating their Subject in an ea&s;y and ob|vious Manner, &s;uch as is be&s;t fitted to plea&s;e the Ima|gination, and engage the Affections. They &s;elect the
<PB N="2" REF="5">
mo&s;t &s;triking Ob&s;ervations and In&s;tances from com|mon Life; place oppo&s;ite Characters in a proper Con|tra&s;t; and alluring us into the Paths of Virtue, by the Views of Glory and of Happine&s;s, direct our Steps into the&s;e Paths, by the &s;ounde&s;t Precepts and mo&s;t illu&s;trious Examples. They make us <HI>feel</HI> the Diffe|rence betwixt Vice and Virtue; they excite and regu|late our Sentiments; and &s;o they can but bend our Hearts to the Love of Probity and true Honour, they think, that they have fully attain'd the End of all their Labours.</P>
<P>THE other Species of Philo&s;ophers treat Man ra|ther as a rea&s;onable than an active Being, and endea|vour to form his Under&s;tanding more than cultivate his Manners. They regard Mankind as a Subject of Speculation; and with a narrow Scrutiny examine human Nature, in order to find tho&s;e Principles, which regulate our Under&s;tandings, excite our Senti|ments, and make us approve or blame any particular Object, Action, or Behaviour. They think it a Re|proach to all Literature, that Philo&s;ophy &s;hould not yet have fixt, beyond Controver&s;y, the Foundation of Morals, Rea&s;oning, and Critici&s;m; and &s;hould for ever talk of Truth and Fal&s;hood, Vice and Virtue, Beauty and Deformity, without being able to deter|mine the Source of the&s;e Di&s;tinctions. While they attempt this arduous Ta&s;k, they are deter'd by no
<PB N="3" REF="6">
Difficulties; but proceeding from particular In&s;tances to general Principles, they &s;till pu&s;h on their Enqui|ries to Principles more general, and re&s;t not &s;atisfy'd till they arrive at tho&s;e original Principles, by which, in every Science, all human Curio&s;ity mu&s;t be bound|ed. Tho' their Speculations &s;eem ab&s;tract and even unintelligible to common Readers, they plea&s;e them|&s;elves with the Approbation of the Learned and the Wi&s;e; and think they are &s;ufficiently compen&s;ated for the Labours of their whole Lives, if they can di&s;|cover &s;ome hidden Truths which may contribute to the In&s;truction of Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>'TIS certain, that the ea&s;y and obvious Philo&s;ophy will always, with the Generality of Mankind, have the Preference to the accurate and ab&s;tru&s;e; and by many will be recommended, not only as more agree|able, but more u&s;eful than the other. It enters more into common Life; moulds the Heart and Affec|tions; and by touching tho&s;e Principles, which actu|ate Men, reforms their Conduct, and brings them nearer that Model of Perfection, which it de&s;cribes. On the contrary, the ab&s;tru&s;e Philo&s;ophy, being founded on a Turn of Mind that cannot enter into Bu&s;ine&s;s and Action, vani&s;hes when the Philo&s;opher leaves the Shade and comes into open Day; nor can its Precepts and Principles ea&s;ily retain any Influence over our Con|duct and Behaviour. The Feelings of our Sentiments,
<PB N="4" REF="7">
the Agitation of our Pa&s;&s;ions, the Vehemence of our Affections, di&s;&s;ipate all its Conclu&s;ions, and reduce the profound Philo&s;opher to a mere Plebeian.</P>
<P>THIS al&s;o mu&s;t be confe&s;t, that the mo&s;t durable, as well as ju&s;te&s;t Fame has been acquired by the ea&s;y Philo&s;ophy, and that ab&s;tract Rea&s;oners &s;eem hitherto to have enjoy'd only a momentary Reputation, from the Caprice or Ignorance of their own Age, but have not been able to &s;upport their Renown with more equitable Po&s;terity. 'Tis ea&s;y for a profound Philo|&s;opher to commit a Mi&s;take in his &s;ubtile Rea&s;onings; and one Mi&s;take is the nece&s;&s;ary Parent of another, while he pu&s;hes on his Con&s;equences, and is not de|ter'd from embracing any Conclu&s;ion, by its unu&s;ual Appearance, or its Contradiction to popular Opinion: But a Philo&s;opher, who propo&s;es only to repre&s;ent the common Sen&s;e of Mankind in more beautiful and more engaging Colours, if by Accident he commits a Mi&s;take, goes no farther; but renewing his Appeal to common Sen&s;e, and the natural Sentiments of the Mind, returns into the right Path, and &s;ecures him|&s;elf from any dangerous Illu&s;ions. The Fame of <HI>Ci|cero</HI> flouri&s;hes at pre&s;ent; but that of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> is ut|terly decay'd. <HI>La Bruyere</HI> pa&s;&s;es the Seas, and &s;till encrea&s;es in Renown: But the Glory of <HI>Malebranche</HI> is confin'd to his own Nation and to his own Age.
<PB N="5" REF="8">
And <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> perhaps, will be read with Plea&s;ure, when <HI>Locke</HI> &s;hall be entirely forgotten<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is not intended any way to detract from the Merit of Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> who was really a great Philo&s;opher, and a ju&s;t and mo|de&s;t Rea&s;oner. 'Tis only meant to &s;hew the common Fate of &s;uch ab&s;tract Philo&s;ophy.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE mere Philo&s;opher is a Character, which is commonly but little acceptable in the World, as be|ing &s;uppos'd to contribute nothing either to the Ad|vantage or Plea&s;ure of Society; while he lives re|mote from Communication with Mankind, and is wrapt up in Principles and Notions equally remote from their Comprehen&s;ion. On the other hand, the mere Ignorant is &s;till more de&s;pis'd; nor is any thing e&s;teem'd a &s;urer Sign of an illiberal Genius, in an Age and Nation where the Sciences flouri&s;h, than to be en|tirely void of all Ta&s;te and Reli&s;h for tho&s;e noble En|tertainments. The mo&s;t perfect Character is &s;uppos'd to lie betwixt tho&s;e Extremes; retaining an equal A|bility and Ta&s;te for Books, Company, and Bu&s;ine&s;s; pre&s;erving in Conver&s;ation that Di&s;cernment and De|licacy, which ari&s;e from polite Letters, and in Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, that Probity and Accuracy, which are the natu|ral Re&s;ult of a ju&s;t Philo&s;ophy. In order to diffu&s;e and cultivate &s;o accompli&s;ht a Character, nothing can be more u&s;eful than Compo&s;itions of the ea&s;y Style and Manner, which draw not too much from Life, re|quire
<PB N="6" REF="9">
no deep Application or Rece&s;s to be compre|hended, and &s;end back the Student among Mankind fall of noble Sentiments and wi&s;e Precepts, applicable to every Emergence of human Life. By means of &s;uch Compo&s;itions, Virtue becomes amiable, Science agreeable, Company in&s;tructive, and Retirement en|tertaining.</P>
<P>MAN is a rea&s;onable Being; and as &s;uch, receives from Science his proper Food and Nouri&s;hment: But &s;o narrow are the Bounds of human Under&s;tanding, that little Satisfaction can be hop'd for, in this Par|ticular, either from the Extent or Security of his Ac|qui&s;itions. Man is a &s;ociable, no le&s;s than a rea&s;ona|nable Being: But neither can he always enjoy Com|pany agreeable and amu&s;ing, or pre&s;erve the proper Reli&s;h of them. Man is al&s;o an active Being; and from that Di&s;po&s;ition, as well as from the various Nece&s;&s;ities of human Life, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to Bu&s;ine&s;s and Occupation: But the Mind requires &s;ome Relaxation, and cannot always &s;upport its Bent to Care and Indu&s;|try. It &s;eems, then, that Nature has pointed out a mixt kind of Life as mo&s;t &s;uitable to human Race, and &s;ecretly admoni&s;h'd them to allow none of the&s;e By|a&s;&s;es to <HI>draw</HI> too much, &s;o as to incapacitate them for other Occupations and Entertainments. Indulge your Pa&s;&s;ion for Science, &s;ays &s;he; but let your Science be human, and &s;uch as may have a direct Reference to
<PB N="7" REF="10">
Action and Society. Ab&s;tru&s;e Thought and profound Re&s;earches I prohibit, and will &s;everely puni&s;h, by the pen&s;ive Melancholy, which they introduce, by the endle&s;s Uncertainty, in which they involve you, and by the cold Reception, which your pretended Di&s;coveries will meet with, when communicated. Be a Philo&s;opher; but amid&s;t all your Philo&s;ophy, be &s;till a Man.</P>
<P>WERE the Generality of Mankind contented to prefer the ea&s;y Philo&s;ophy to the ab&s;tract and profound, without throwing any Blame or Contempt on the lat|ter, it might not be improper, perhaps, to comply with this general Opinion, and allow every Man to enjoy, without Oppo&s;ition, his own Ta&s;te and Senti|ment. But as the Matter is often carry'd farther, even to the ab&s;olute rejecting all profound Rea&s;onings or what is commonly call'd <HI>Metaphy&s;ics,</HI> we &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider what can rea&s;onably be pleaded in their Behalf.</P>
<P>WE may begin with ob&s;erving, that one con&s;ide|rable Advantage, which re&s;ults from the accurate and ab&s;tract Philo&s;ophy, is, its Sub&s;erviency to the ea&s;y and humane, which, without the former, can never attain a &s;ufficient Degree of Exactne&s;s, in its Senti|ments, Precepts, or Rea&s;onings. All polite Letters are nothing but Pictures of human Life in various At|titades
<PB N="8" REF="11">
and Situations; and in&s;pire us with different Sentiments of Prai&s;e or Blame, Admiration or Ridi|cale, according to the Qualities of the Object, which they &s;et before us. An Arti&s;t mu&s;t be better qualify'd to &s;acceed in this Undertaking, who, be&s;ides a deli|cate Ta&s;te and a quick Apprehen&s;ion, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an accu|rate Knowledge of the internal Fabric, the Opera|tions of the Under&s;tanding, the Workings of the Pa&s;|&s;ions, and the various Species of Sentiments, which di&s;criminate Vice and Virtue. However painful this inward Search or Enquiry may appear, it becomes, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, requi&s;ite to tho&s;e, who would de|&s;cribe with Succe&s;s the obvious and outward Appear|ances of Life and Manners. The Anatomi&s;t pre&s;ents to the Eye the mo&s;t hideous and di&s;agreeable Objects; but his Science is highly u&s;eful to the Painter in de|lineating even a <HI>Venus</HI> or an <HI>Helen.</HI> While the latter employs all the riche&s;t Colours of his Art, and gives his Figures the mo&s;t graceful and engaging Airs; he mu&s;t &s;till carry his Attention to the inward Structure of the human Body, the Po&s;ition of the Mu&s;cles, the Fa|bric of the Bones, and the U&s;e and Figure of every Part or Organ. Accuracy is, in every Ca&s;e, advan|tageous to Beauty, and ju&s;t Rea&s;oning to delicate Sen|timents. In vain would we exalt the one, by depre|ciating the other.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12">
BESIDES, we may ob&s;erve, in every Art or Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, even tho&s;e which mo&s;t concern Life or Action, that a Spirit of Accuracy, however acquir'd, carries all of them nearer their Perfection, and renders them more &s;ub&s;ervient to the Intere&s;ts of Society. And tho' a Philo&s;opher may live remote from Bu&s;ine&s;s and Employment, the Genius of Philo&s;ophy, if carefully cultivated by &s;everal, mu&s;t gradually diffu&s;e it&s;elf thro' the whole Society, and be&s;tow a &s;imilar Accuracy on every Art and Calling. The Politician will acquire greater Fore&s;ight and Subtilty, in the &s;ubdividing and ballancing of Power; the Lawyer more Method and finer Principles in his Rea&s;onings; and the General more Regularity in his Di&s;cipline, and more Caution in his Plans and Operations. The Stability of mo|dern Governments above the antient, and the Accu|racy of modern Philo&s;ophy, have improv'd and pro|bably will &s;till improve, by &s;imilar Gradations.</P>
<P>WERE there no Advantage to be reap'd from the&s;e Studies beyond the Gratification of an innocent Cu|rio&s;ity, yet ought not even this to be de&s;pis'd; as being one Acce&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e few &s;afe and harmle&s;s Plea|&s;ures, which are be&s;tow'd on human Race. The &s;weet|e&s;t and mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive Path of Life leads thro' the Avenues of Science and Learning; and whoever can either remove any Ob&s;tructions in this Way, or open up any new Pro&s;pect, ought &s;o far to be
<PB N="10" REF="13">
e&s;teem'd a Benefactor to Mankind. And tho' the&s;e Re&s;earches may appear painful and fatiguing; 'tis with &s;ome Minds as with &s;ome Bodies, which, being endow'd with vigorous and florid Health, require &s;e|vere Exerci&s;e, and reap a Plea&s;ure from what, to the Generality of Mankind, may &s;eem burthen&s;ome and laborious. Ob&s;curity, indeed, is painful to the Mind as well as to the Eye; but to bring Light from Ob|&s;curity, by whatever Labour, mu&s;t needs be delight|ful and rejoicing.</P>
<P>BUT this Ob&s;curity, in the profound and ab&s;tract Philo&s;ophy, is objected to, not only as painful and di&s;agreeable, but as the inevitable Source of Uncer|tainty and Error. Here indeed lie the ju&s;te&s;t and mo&s;t plaufible Objection again&s;t a con&s;iderable Part of Metaphy&s;ics, that they are not properly a Science, but ari&s;e either from the fruitle&s;s Efforts of human Va|nity, which would penetrate into Subjects utterly in|acce&s;&s;ible to the Under&s;tanding, or from the Craft of popular Super&s;titions, which, being unable to de|fend them&s;elves on fair Ground, rai&s;e the&s;e entangling Brambles to cover and protect their Weakne&s;s. Chac'd from the open Country, the&s;e Robbers fly into the Fore&s;t, and lie in wait to break in upon every un|guarded Avenue of the Mind, and over-whelm it with religious Fears and Prejudices. The &s;loute&s;t Antago|ni&s;t, if he remits his Watch a Moment, is oppre&s;t:
<PB N="11" REF="14">
And many, thro' Cowardice and Folly, open the Gates to the Enemies, and willingly receive them with Reverence and Submi&s;&s;ion, as their legal Sove|reigns.</P>
<P>BUT is this a ju&s;t Cau&s;e why Philo&s;ophers &s;hould de&s;i&s;t from &s;uch Re&s;earches, and leave Super&s;tition &s;till in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Retreat? Is it not rea&s;onable to draw a direct contrary Conclu&s;ion, and perceive the Nece&s;&s;ity of carrying the War into the mo&s;t &s;ecret Rece&s;&s;es of the Enemy? In vain do we hope, that Men, from frequent Di&s;appointments, will at la&s;t a|bandon &s;uch airy Sciences, and di&s;cover the proper Province of human Rea&s;on. For be&s;ides, that many Per&s;ons find too &s;en&s;ible an Intere&s;t in perpetually re|calling &s;uch Topics; be&s;ides this, I &s;ay, the Motive of blind De&s;pair can never rea&s;onably have place in the Sciences; &s;ince, however un&s;ucce&s;sful former At|tempts may have prov'd, there is &s;till room to hope, that the Indu&s;try, Good-fortune, or improv'd Saga|city of &s;ucceeding Generations may reach Di&s;coveries unknown to former Ages. Each adventurous Genius will &s;till leap at the arduous Prize, and find him&s;elf &s;timulated, rather than di&s;courag'd, by the Failures of his Predece&s;&s;ors; while he hopes, that the Glory of atchieving &s;o hard an Adventure is re&s;erv'd for him alone. The only Method of freeing Learning, at|once, from the&s;e ab&s;tru&s;e Que&s;tions, is to enquire &s;e|riou&s;ly
<PB N="12" REF="15">
into the Nature of human Under&s;tanding, and &s;hew, from an exact Analy&s;is of its Powers and Ca|pacity, that it is, by no means, fitted for &s;uch remote and ab&s;tru&s;e Subjects. We mu&s;t &s;ubmit to this Fa|tigue, in order to live at Ea&s;e ever after: And mu&s;t cultivate true Metaphy&s;ics with &s;ome Care, in order to de&s;troy the fal&s;e and adulterate. Indolence, which, to &s;ome Per&s;ons, affords a Safeguard again&s;t this de|ceitful Philo&s;ophy, is, with others, over-ballanc'd by Curio&s;ity; and De&s;pair, which, at &s;ome Moments, prevails, may give place afterwards to &s;anguine Hopes and Expectations. Accurate and ju&s;t Rea&s;oning is the only catholic Remedy, fitted for all Per&s;ons and all Di&s;po&s;itions, and is alone able to &s;ubvert that ab&s;tru&s;e Philo&s;ophy and metaphy&s;ical Jargon, which, being mixt up with popular Super&s;tition, renders it, in a manner, impenetrable to carele&s;s Rea&s;oners, and gives it the Air of Science and Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>BESIDE this Advantage of rejecting, after deliberate Enquiry, the mo&s;t uncertain and di&s;agreeable Part of Learning, there are many po&s;itive Advantages, which re&s;ult from an accurate Scrutiny into the Powers and Fa|culties of human Nature. 'Tis remarkable concerning the Operations of the Mind, that tho' mo&s;t intimately pre&s;ent to us, yet whenever they become the Object of Reflection, they &s;eem involv'd in Ob&s;curity, nor can the Eye readily find tho&s;e Lines and Boundaries, which di&s;criminate and di&s;tingui&s;h them. The Objects are
<PB N="13" REF="16">
too fine to remain long in the &s;ame A&s;pect or Situa|tion; and mu&s;t be apprehended, in an In&s;tant, by a &s;uperior Subtilty and Penetration, deriv'd from Nature, and improv'd by Habit and Reflection. It becomes, therefore, no incon&s;iderable Part of Science barely to know the different Operations of the Mind, to &s;epa|rate them from each other, to cla&s;s them under their proper Divi&s;ions, and to correct all that &s;eeming Di&s;|order, in which they lie involv'd, when made the Ob|ject of Reflection and Enquiry. This Ta&s;k of order|ing and di&s;tingui&s;hing, which has no Merit, when per|form'd with regard to external Bodies, the Objects of our Sen&s;es, ri&s;es in its Value, when directed towards the Operations of the Mind, in proportion to the Dif|ficulty and Labour, which we meet with in perform|ing it. And if we can go no farther than this mental Geography or Delineation of the di&s;tinct Parts and Powers of the Mind, 'tis at lea&s;t a Satisfaction to go &s;o far; and the more contemptible this Science may ap|pear (and it is by no means contemptible) the more contemptible &s;till mu&s;t the Ignorance of it appear, in all Pretenders to Learning and Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>NOR can there remain any Su&s;picion, that this Sci|ence is uncertain and chimerical; unle&s;s we &s;hould en|tertain &s;uch a Sceptici&s;m, as is entirely &s;ubver&s;ive of all Speculation, and even Action. It cannot be doubt|ed, that the Mind is endow'd with &s;everal Powers and
<PB N="14" REF="17">
Faculties, that the&s;e Powers are totally di&s;tinct from each other, that what is really di&s;tinct to the imme|diate Perception may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by Reflection; and con&s;equently, that there is a Truth and Fal&s;hood in all Propo&s;itions on this Subject, and a Truth and Fal&s;hood, which lies not beyond the Compa&s;s of hu|man Under&s;tanding. There are many obvious Di|&s;tinctions of this kind, &s;uch as tho&s;e betwixt the Will and Under&s;tanding, the Imagination and Pa&s;&s;ions, which fall within the Comprehen&s;ion of every human Creature; and the finer and more philo&s;ophical Di|&s;tinctions are no le&s;s real and certain, tho' more diffi|cult to be comprehended. Some In&s;tances, e&s;pecially late ones, of Succe&s;s in the&s;e Enquiries, may give us a ju&s;ter Notion of the Certainty and Solidity of this Branch of Learning. And &s;hall we e&s;teem it worthy the Labour of a Philo&s;opher to give us a true Sy&s;tem of the Planets, and adju&s;t the Po&s;ition and Order of tho&s;e remote Bodies; while we affect to overlook tho&s;e, who, with &s;o much Succe&s;s, delineate and de&s;cribe the Parts of the Mind, in which we are &s;o intimately concern'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>That Faculty, by which we di&s;cern Truth and Fal&s;hood, and that by which we perceive Vice and Virtue had long been confounded with each other, and all Morality was &s;uppos'd to be built on eternal and immutable Relations, which to every in|telligent Mind were equally invariable as any Propo&s;ition con|cerning Quantity or Number. But a <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hutche&s;on.</HI></NOTE> late Philo&s;opher has taught us, by the mo&s;t convincing Arguments, that Morality is nothing in the ab&s;tract Nature of Things, but is entirely relative to the Sentiment or mental Ta&s;te of each particular Being; in the &s;ame Manner as the Di&s;tinctions of &s;weet and bitter, hot and cold, ari&s;e from the particular Feeling of each Sen&s;e or Organ. Moral Perceptions therefore, ought not to be cla&s;s'd with the Opera|tions of the Under&s;tanding, but with the Ta&s;tes or Sentiments.</P>
<P>It had been u&s;ual with Philo&s;ophers to divide all the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind into two Cla&s;&s;es, the &s;elfi&s;h and benevolent, which were &s;uppos'd to &s;tand in con&s;tant Oppo&s;ition and Contrariety; nor was it thought that the latter could ever attain their proper Object but at the Expence of the former. Among the &s;elfi&s;h Pa&s;|&s;ions were rank'd Avarice, Ambition, Revenge: Among the be|nevolent, natural Affection, Friend&s;hip, public Spirit. Philo&s;o|phers may now <NOTE N="&sect;">See <HI>Butler</HI>'s Sermons.</NOTE> perceive the Impropriety of this Divi&s;ion. It has been prov'd, beyond all Controver&s;y, that even the Pa&s;&s;ions, commonly e&s;teem'd &s;elfi&s;h, carry the Mind beyond Self, directly to the Object; that tho' the Satisfaction of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions gives us Enjoyment, yet the Pro&s;pect of this Enjoyment is not the Cau&s;e of the Pa&s;&s;ion, but on the contrary the Pa&s;&s;ion is antece|dent to the Enjoyment, and without the former, the latter could never po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t; that the Ca&s;e is preci&s;ely the &s;ame with the Pa&s;&s;ions, denominated benevolent, and con&s;equently that a Man is no more intere&s;ted when he &s;eeks his own Glory than when the Happine&s;s of his Friend is the Object of his Wi&s;hes; nor is he any more di&s;intere&s;ted when he &s;acrifices his Ea&s;e and Quiet to public Good than when he labours for the Gratification of Ava|rice and Ambition. Here therefore is a con&s;iderable Adju&s;tment in the Boundaries of the Pa&s;&s;ions, which had been confounded by the Negligence or Inaccuracy of former Philo&s;ophers.

This la&s;t Conclu&s;ion, &s;urely, is not de&s;irable, nor ought it to be embrac'd too ra&s;hly.

<HEAD>ESSAY II. Of the ORIGIN of IDEAS.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY one will readily allow, that there is a con&s;iderable Difference betwixt the Perceptions of the Mind, when a Man feels the Pain of exce&s;&s;ive Heat or the Plea&s;ure of moderate Warmth, and when he afterwards recalls to his Memory this Sen&s;ation, or anticipates it by his Imagination. The&s;e Faculties may mimick or copy the Perceptions of the Sen&s;es; but they never can reach entirely the Force and Vi|vacity of the original Sentiment. The utmo&s;t we &s;ay of them, even when they operate with greate&s;t Vigour, is, that they repre&s;ent their Object in &s;o lively a Man|ner, that we could <HI>almo&s;t</HI> &s;ay we feel or &s;ee it: But, except the Mind be di&s;order'd by Di&s;ea&s;e or Madne&s;s, they never can arrive at &s;uch a pitch of Vivacity as to render the&s;e Perceptions altogether undi&s;tingui&s;hable. All the Colours of Poetry, however &s;plendid, can ne|ver paint natural Objects in &s;uch a manner as to make the De&s;cription be taken for a real Land&s;kip. The
<PB N="22" REF="24">
mo&s;t lively Thought is &s;till inferior to the dulle&s;t Sen|&s;ation.</P>
<P>WE may ob&s;erve a like Di&s;tinction to run thro' all the other Perceptions of the Mind. A Man, in a Fit of Anger, is actuated in a very different Manner from one, who only thinks of that Emotion. If you tell me, that any Per&s;on is in Love, I ea&s;ily under&s;tand your Meaning, and form a ju&s;t Conception of his Si|tuation; but never can mi&s;take that Conception for the real Di&s;orders and Agitations of the Pa&s;&s;ion. When we reflect on all our pa&s;t Sentiments and Affec|tions, our Thought is a faithful Mirror, and copies its Objects truly; but the Colours it employs are faded and dead, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e, in which our origi|nal Perceptions were cloth'd. It requires no nice Di&s;cernment nor metaphy&s;ical Head to mark the Di|&s;tinction betwixt them.</P>
<P>HERE therefore we may divide all the Perceptions of the Mind into two Cla&s;&s;es or Species, which are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by their different Degrees of Force and Vivacity. The le&s;s forcible and lively are commonly denominated THOUGHTS or IDEAS. The other Spe|cies want a Name in our Language, and in mo&s;t o|thers; I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e it was not requi&s;ite for any, but philo&s;ophical Purpo&s;es, to rank them under a ge|neral Term or Appellation. Let us, therefore, u&s;e a little Freedom, and call them IMPRESSIONS, employ|ing
<PB N="23" REF="25">
that Word in a Sen&s;e &s;omewhat different from the u&s;ual. By the Term, <HI>Impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> then, we mean all our more lively Perceptions, when we hear, or &s;ee, or feel, or love, or hate, or de&s;ire, or will. And Im|pre&s;&s;ions are contradi&s;tingui&s;h'd from Ideas, which are the le&s;s lively Perceptions we are con&s;cious of, when we reflect on any of the&s;e Sen&s;ations or Movements above mention'd.</P>
<P>NOTHING, at fir&s;t View, may &s;eem more un|bounded than the Thought of Man, which not only e&s;capes all human Power and Authority, but is not even re&s;train'd within the Limits of Nature and Re|ality. To form Mon&s;ters, and join incongruous Shapes and Appearances co&s;ts it no more Trouble than to con|ceive the mo&s;t natural and familiar Objects. And while the Body is confin'd to one Planet, along which it creeps with Pain and Difficulty; the Thought can in an In&s;tant tran&s;port us into the mo&s;t di&s;tant Regions of the Univer&s;e; or even beyond the Univer&s;e, into the unbounded Chaos, where Nature is &s;uppos'd to lie in total Confu&s;ion. What never was &s;een, nor heard of may yet be conceiv'd; nor is any thing beyond the Power of Thought, except what implies an ab&s;o|late Contradiction.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Thought &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s this unbounded Liberty, we &s;hall find, upon a nearer Examination, that it is really confin'd within very narrow Limits,
<PB N="24" REF="26">
and that all this creative Power of the Mind amounts to no more than the compounding, tran&s;po&s;ing, aug|menting, or dimini&s;hing the Materials afforded us by the Sen&s;es and Experience. When we think of a gol|den Mountain, we only join two con&s;i&s;tent Ideas, <HI>Gold,</HI> and <HI>Mountain,</HI> with which we were formerly acquainted. A virtuous Hor&s;e we can conceive; be|cau&s;e, from our own Feeling, we can conceive Vir|tue, and this we may unite to the Figure and Shape of a Hor&s;e, which is an Animal familiar to us. In &s;hort all the Materials of thinking are deriv'd either from our outward or inward Sentiment: The Mixture and Compo&s;ition of the&s;e belongs alone to the Mind and Will. Or to expre&s;s my&s;elf in more philo&s;ophical Language, all our Ideas or more feeble Perceptions are Copies of our Impre&s;&s;ions or more lively ones.</P>
<P>TO prove this, the two following Arguments will, I hope, be &s;ufficient. Fir&s;t, When we analy&s;e our Thoughts or Ideas, however compounded or &s;ublime, we always find, that they re&s;olve them&s;elves into &s;uch &s;imple Ideas as were copy'd from a precedent Feeling or Sentiment. Even tho&s;e Ideas, which, at fir&s;t View, &s;eem the mo&s;t wide of this Origin, are found, upon a narrower Scratiny, to be deriv'd from it. The Idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wi&s;e, and good Being, ari&s;es from reflecting on the Opera|tions of our own Mind, and augmenting tho&s;e Quali|ties
<PB N="25" REF="27">
of Goodne&s;s and Wi&s;dom, without Bound or Li|mit. We may pro&s;ecute this Enquiry to what Length we plea&s;e; where we &s;hall always find, that every Idea we examine is copy'd from a &s;imilar Impre&s;&s;ion. Tho&s;e, who would a&s;&s;ert, that this Po&s;ition is not ab|&s;olutely univer&s;al and without Exception, have only one, and that an ea&s;y Method of re&s;uting it, by pro|ducing that Idea, which, in their Opinion, is not de|riv'd from this Source. It will then be incumbent on us, if we would maintain our Doctrine, to produce the Impre&s;&s;ion or lively Perception, that corre&s;ponds to it.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. If it happen, from a Defect of the Organ, that a Man is not &s;u&s;ceptible of any Species of Sen&s;ations, we always find, that he is as little &s;u&s;cep|tible of the corre&s;pondent Ideas. A blind Man can form no Notion of Colours; a deaf Man of Sounds. Re&s;tore either of them that Sen&s;e, in which he is de|ficient; by opening this new Inlet for his Sen&s;ations, you al&s;o open an Inlet for the Ideas, and he finds no Difficulty of conceiving the&s;e Objects. The Ca&s;e is the &s;ame if the Object, proper for exciting any Sen&s;a|tion, has never been apply'd to the Organ. A <HI>Lap|lander</HI> or <HI>Negro</HI> has no Notion of the Reli&s;h of Wine. And tho' there are few or no In&s;tances of a like Defi|ciency in the Mind, where a Per&s;on has never felt or is altogether incapable of a Sentiment or Pa&s;&s;ion, that belongs to his Species; yet we find the &s;ame Ob&s;erva|tion
<PB N="26" REF="28">
to take place in a le&s;&s;er Degree. A Man of mild Manners can form no Notion of inveterate Revenge or Cruelty; nor can a &s;elfi&s;h Heart ea&s;ily conceive the Heights of Friend&s;hip and Genero&s;ity. 'Tis readily allow'd, that other Beings may po&s;&s;e&s;s many Sen&s;es, of which we can have no Conception; becau&s;e the Ideas of them have never been introduc'd to us in the only Manner, by which an Idea can have acce&s;s to the Mind, <HI>viz.</HI> by the actual Feeling and Sen&s;ation.</P>
<P>THERE is, however, one contradictory Phaenome|non, which may prove, that 'tis not ab&s;olutely im|po&s;&s;ible for Ideas to go before their corre&s;pondent Im|pre&s;&s;ions. I believe it will readily be allow'd, that the &s;everal di&s;tinct Ideas of Colours, which enter by the Eyes, or tho&s;e of Sounds, which are convey'd by the Hearing, are really different from each other; tho', at the &s;ame time, re&s;embling. Now if this be true of different Colours, it mu&s;t be no le&s;s &s;o, of the different Shades of the &s;ame Colour; and each Shade produces a di&s;tinct Idea, independent of the re&s;t. For if this &s;hould be deny'd, 'tis po&s;&s;ible, by the continual Gradation of Shades, to run a Colour in&s;en&s;ibly into what is mo&s;t remote from it; and if you will not al|low any of the Means to be different, you cannot, without Ab&s;urdity, deny the Extremes to be the &s;ame. Suppo&s;e, therefore, a Per&s;on to have enjoy'd his Sight for thirty Years, and to have become perfectly well
<PB N="27" REF="29">
acquainted with Colours of all kinds, excepting one particular Shade of Blue, for In&s;tance, which it never has been his fortune to meet with. Let all the diffe|rent Shades of that Colour, except that &s;ingle one, be plac'd before him, de&s;cending gradually from the deepe&s;t to the lighte&s;t; 'tis plain, that he will perceive a Blank, where that Shade is wanting, and will be &s;en|&s;ible, that there is a greater Di&s;tance in that Place be|twixt the contiguous Colours than in any other. Now I a&s;k, whether 'tis po&s;&s;ible for him, from his own Imagination, to &s;upply this Deficiency, and rai&s;e up to him&s;elf the Idea of that particular Shade, tho' it had never been convey'd to him by his Sen&s;es? I believe there are few but will be of Opinion that he can; and this may &s;erve as a Proof, that the &s;imple Ideas are not always, in every In&s;tance, deriv'd from the corre&s;pondent Impre&s;&s;ions; tho' this In&s;tance is &s;o particular and &s;ingular, that 'tis &s;carce worth our ob|&s;erving, and does not merit, that for it alone we &s;hould alter our general Maxim.</P>
<P>HERE, therefore, is a Propo&s;ition, which not only &s;eems, in it&s;elf, &s;imple and intelligible; but, if pro|perly employ'd, might render every Di&s;pute equally intelligible, and bani&s;h all that Jargon, which has &s;o long taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of metaphy&s;ical Rea&s;onings, and drawn &s;uch Di&s;grace upon them: All Ideas, e&s;pecially ab&s;tract ones, are naturally faint and ob&s;cure: The Mind has but a &s;lender Hold of them: They are apt
<PB N="28" REF="30">
to be confounded with other re&s;embling Ideas: And when we have often employ'd any Term, tho' without a di&s;tinct Meaning, we are apt to imagine it has a de|terminate Idea, annex'd to it. On the contrary, all Impre&s;&s;ions, that is, all Sen&s;ations, either outward or inward, are &s;trong and &s;en&s;ible: The Limits betwixt them are more exactly determin'd: Nor is it ea&s;y to fall into any Error or Mi&s;take with regard to them. When therefore we entertain any Su&s;picion, that a philo&s;ophical Term is employ'd without any Meaning or Idea (as is but too frequent) we need but enquire, <HI>from what Impre&s;&s;ion is that &s;uppos'd Idea deriv'd?</HI> And if it be impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;ign any, this will &s;erve to confirm our Su&s;picion. By bringing Ideas into &s;o clear a Light, we may rea&s;onably hope to remove all Di&s;pute, that may ari&s;e, concerning their Nature and Reality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>'Tis probable, that no more was meant by tho&s;e, who de|ny'd innate Ideas, than that all our Ideas were Copies of our Impre&s;&s;ions; tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that the Terms they employ'd were not cho&s;en with &s;uch Caution, nor &s;o exactly de|fin'd as to prevent all Mi&s;takes about their Doctrine.

If by innate be meant, cotemporary to our Birth, the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">|pute &s;eems to be frivolous; nor is it worth while to enquire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> what time Thinking begins, whether before, at, or after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Birth.

Now in this Sen&s;e I would de&s;ire to know, what can be meant by a&s;&s;erting, that Self-Love, or Re&s;entment of Inju|ries, or the Pa&s;&s;ion betwixt the Sexes is not innate?</P>
<P>But admitting the&s;e Terms, <HI>Impre&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Ideas,</HI> in the Sen&s;e above explain'd, and under&s;tanding by <HI>innate</HI> what is original or copy'd from no pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">ent Perception, then may we a&s;&s;ert, that all our Impre&s;&s;ions are innate, and our Ideas not innate.</P>
<P>To be ingenuous.

ESSAY III. Of the CONNEXION of IDEAS.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS evident, that there is a Principle of Con|nexion betwixt the different Thoughts or I|deas of the Mind, and that in their Appearance to the Memory or Imagination, they introduce each other with a certain Degree of Method and Regularity. In our more &s;erious Thinking or Di&s;cour&s;e, this is &s;o ob|&s;ervable, that any particular Thought, which breaks in upon this regular Tract or Chain of Ideas, is im|mediately remark'd and rejected. And even in our wilde&s;t and mo&s;t wandering Reveries, nay in our very Dreams, we &s;hall find, if we reflect, that the Imagi|nation run not altogether at Adventures, but that there was &s;till a Connexion upheld among the different Ideas, which &s;ucceeded each other. Were the loo&s;e&s;t and free&s;t Conver&s;ation to be tran&s;crib'd, there would immediately be ob&s;erv'd &s;omething, which connected it in all its Tran&s;itions. Or where this is wanting, the Per&s;on, who broke the Thread of Di&s;cour&s;e, might
<PB N="32" REF="33">
&s;till inform you, that there had &s;ecretly revolv'd in his Mind a Succe&s;&s;ion of Thought, which had gradually led him away from the Subject of Conver&s;ation. A|mong&s;t the Languages of different Nations, even where we cannot &s;u&s;pect the lea&s;t Connexion or Communi|cation, 'tis found, that the Words, expre&s;&s;ive of the mo&s;t compound Ideas, do yet nearly corre&s;pond to each other: A certain Proof, that the &s;imple Ideas, which they expre&s;s, were bound together by &s;ome univer&s;al Principle, which had an equal Influence on all Mankind.</P>
<P>THO' it be too obvious to e&s;cape our Ob&s;ervation, that different Ideas are connected together; I do not find, that any Philo&s;opher has attempted to enumerate or cla&s;s all the Principles of Connexion; a Subject, however, that &s;eems very worthy of our Curio&s;ity. To me, there appears to be only three Principles of Connexion among Ideas, <HI>viz. Re&s;emblance, Contiguity</HI> in Time or Place, and <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> or <HI>Effect.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the&s;e Principles &s;erve to connect Ideas will not, I believe, be much doubted. A Picture naturally leads our Thoughts to the Original<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Re&s;emblance.</NOTE>: The Mention of one Apartment in a Building naturally introduces an Enquiry or Di&s;cour&s;e concerning the others<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Contiguity.</NOTE>: And if
<PB N="33" REF="34">
we think of an Wound, we can &s;carce forbear reflecting on the Pain, which follows it<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Cau&s;e and Effect.</NOTE>. But that this Enu|meration is compleat, and that there are no other Prin|ciples of Connexion, except the&s;e, may be difficult to prove to the Satisfaction of the Reader, or even to a Man's own Satisfaction. All we can do, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, is to run over &s;everal In&s;tances, and examine carefully the Principle, that binds the different Thoughts to each other, never &s;toping till we ren|der the Principle as general as po&s;&s;ible. The more in&s;tances we examine, and the more Care we employ, the more A&s;&s;urance &s;hall we acquire, that the Enu|meration which we form from the Whole, is com|pleat and entire. In&s;tead of entering into a Detail of this kind, which would lead us into many u&s;ele&s;s Sub|tilities, we &s;hall con&s;ider &s;ome of the Effects of this Connexion upon the Pa&s;&s;ions and Imagination; where we may open up a Field of Speculation more en|tertaining, and perhaps more in&s;tructive, than the other.</P>
<P>AS Man is a rea&s;onable Being, and is continually in Pur&s;uit of Happine&s;s, which he hopes to find in the Gratification of &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion or Affection, he &s;el|dom acts or &s;peaks or thinks without a Purpo&s;e and Intention. He has &s;till &s;ome Object in View; and however improper the Means may &s;ometimes be,
<PB N="34" REF="35">
which he chu&s;es for the Attainment of his End, he ne|ver lo&s;es View of an End, nor will he &s;o much as throw away his Thoughts or Reflections, where he hopes not to reap any Satisfaction from them.</P>
<P>IN all Compo&s;itions of Genius, therefore, 'tis re|qui&s;ite that the Writer have &s;ome Plan or Object; and tho he may be hurry'd from this Plan by the Ve|hemence of Thought, as in an Ode, or drop it care|le&s;ly, as in an Epi&s;tle or E&s;&s;ay, there mu&s;t appear &s;ome Aim or Intention, in his fir&s;t &s;etting out, if not in the Compo&s;ition of the whole Work. A Produc|tion without a De&s;ign would re&s;emble more the Rav|ings of a Madman, than the &s;ober Efforts of Genius and Learning.</P>
<P>As this Rule admits of no Exception, it follows, that in narrative Compo&s;itions, the Events or Actions, which the Writer relates, mu&s;t be connected together, by &s;ome Bond or Tye: They mu&s;t be related to each other in the Imagination, and &s;orm a kind of <HI>Unity,</HI> which may bring them under one Plan or View, and which may be the Object or End of the Writer in his fir&s;t Undertaking.</P>
<P>THIS connecting Principle among the &s;everal E|vents, which form the Subject of a Poem or Hi&s;tory
<PB N="35" REF="36">
may be very different, according to the different De|&s;igns of the Poet or Hi&s;torian. <HI>Ovid</HI> has &s;orm'd his Plan upon the connecting Principle of Re&s;emblance. Every fabulous Transformation, produc'd by the mi|raculous Power of the Gods, falls within the Compa&s;s of his Work. There needs but this one Circum&s;tance in any Event to bring it under his original Plan or In|tention.</P>
<P>AN Annali&s;t or Hi&s;torian, who &s;hould undertake to write the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Europe</HI> during any Century, would be influenc'd by the Connexion of Contiguity in Time or Place. All Events, which happen in that Portion of Space, and Period of Time, are compre|hended in his De&s;ign, tho' in other re&s;pects different and unconnected. They have &s;till a Species of Unity, amid&s;t all their Diver&s;ity.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t u&s;ual Species of Connexion among the different Events, which enter into any narrative Com|po&s;ition, is that of Cau&s;e and Effect; while the Hi|&s;torian traces the Series of Actions according to their natural Order, remounts to their &s;ecret Springs and Principles, and delineates their mo&s;t remote Con&s;e|quences. He chu&s;es for his Subject a certain Portion of that great Chain of Events, which compo&s;e the Hi&s;tory of Mankind: Each Link in this Chain he en|deavours to touch in his Narration: Sometimes, un|avoidable

Ignorance renders all his Attempts fruitle&s;s: Sometimes, he &s;upplies by Conjecture what is want|ing in Knowledge: And always, he is &s;en&s;ible, that the more unbroken the Chain is, which he pre&s;ents to his Readers, the more perfect is his Production.

of Life, a Man's Actions have a Dependance on each other, but al&s;o during the whole Period of his Dura|tion, from the Cradle to the Grave; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;trike off one Link, however minute, in this regu|lar Chain, without affecting the whole Series of E|vents, which follow. The Unity of Action, there|fore, which is to be found in Biography or Hi&s;tory, differs from that of Epic Poetry, not in Kind, but in Degree. In Epic Poetry, the Connexion among the Events is more clo&s;e and &s;en&s;ible: The Narration is not carry'd on thro' &s;uch a Length of Time: And the Actors ha&s;ten to &s;ome remarkable Period, which &s;atisfies the Curio&s;ity of the Reader. This Conduct of the Epic Poet depends on that particular Situation of the <HI>Imagination</HI> and of the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> which is &s;uppos'd in that Production. The Imagination, both of Writer and Reader, is more enliven'd, and the Pa&s;&s;ions more enflam'd than in Hi&s;tory, Biography, or any Species of Narration, that confine them&s;elves to &s;trict Truth and Reality. Let us con&s;ider the Effect of the&s;e two Circum&s;tances, of an enliven'd Imagination and en|flam'd Pa&s;&s;ions, which belong to Poetry, e&s;pecially the Epic Kind, above any other Species of Compo|&s;ition; and let us &s;ee for what Rea&s;on they require a &s;tricter and clo&s;er Unity in the Fable.</P>
<P>FIRST. All Poetry, being a Species of Painting, approches us nearer to the Objects than any other Species of Narration, throws a &s;tronger Light upon
<PB N="38" REF="39">
them, and delineates more di&s;tinctly tho&s;e minute Cir|cum&s;tances, which, tho' to the Hi&s;torian they &s;eem &s;uperfluous, &s;erve mightily to enliven the Imagery, and gratify the Fancy. If it be not nece&s;&s;ary, as in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> to inform us each time the Hero buckles his Shoes, and ties his Garters, 'twill be requi&s;ite, per|haps, to enter into a greater Detail than in the <HI>Hen|riade</HI>; where the Events are run over with &s;uch Ra|pidity, that we &s;carce have Leizure to become ac|quainted with the Scene or Action. Were a Poet, therefore, to comprehend in his Subject any great Compa&s;s of Time or Series of Events, and trace up the Death of <HI>Hector</HI> to its remote Cau&s;es, in the Rape of <HI>Helen,</HI> or the Judgment of <HI>Paris</HI>; he mu&s;t draw out his Poem to an immea&s;urable Length, in order to fill this large Canvas with ju&s;t Painting and Imagery. The Reader's Imagination, enflam'd with &s;uch a Se|ries of poetical De&s;criptions, and his Pa&s;&s;ions, agitated by a continual Sympathy with the Actors, mu&s;t flag long before the Period of the Narration, and mu&s;t &s;ink into La&s;&s;itude and Di&s;gu&s;t, from the repeated Violence of the &s;ame Movements.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. That an Epic Poet mu&s;t not trace the Cau&s;es to any great Di&s;tance, will farther appear, if we con&s;ider another Rea&s;on, which is drawn from a Property of the Pa&s;&s;ions &s;till more remarkable and &s;in|gular. 'Tis evident, that, in a ju&s;t Compo&s;ition, all the Affections, excited by the different Events, de|&s;crib'd
<PB N="39" REF="40">
and repre&s;ented, add mutual Force to each|other; and that, while the Heroes are all engag'd in one common Scene, and each Action is &s;trongly con|nected with the whole, the Concern is continually awake, and the Pa&s;&s;ions make an ea&s;y Tran&s;ition from one Object to another. The &s;trong Connexion of the Events, as it &s;acilitates the Pa&s;&s;age of the Thought or Imagination from one to another, facilitates al&s;o the Transfu&s;ion of the Pa&s;&s;ions, and pre&s;erves the Af|fection &s;till in the &s;ame Channel and Direction. Our Sympathy and Concern for <HI>Eve</HI> prepares the Way for a like Sympathy with <HI>Adam:</HI> The Affection is pre|&s;erv'd almo&s;t entire in the Tran&s;ition; and the Mind &s;eizes immediately the new Object as &s;trongly related to that which formerly engag'd its Attention. But were the Poet to make a total Digre&s;&s;ion from his Sub|ject, and introduce a new Actor, no way connected with the Per&s;onages, the Imagination, feeling a Breach in the Tran&s;ition, would enter coldly into the new Scene; would kindle by &s;low Degrees; and in return|ing to the main Subject of the Poem, would pa&s;s, as it were, upon foreign Ground, and have its Concern to excite anew, in order to take Party with the prin|cipal Actors. The &s;ame Inconvenience follows in a le&s;&s;er Degree, where the Poet traces his Events to too great a Di&s;tance, and binds together Actions, which, tho' not altogether disjoin'd, have not &s;o &s;trong a Connexion as is requi&s;ite to forward the Tran&s;ition of the Pa&s;&s;ions. Hence ari&s;es the Artifice of oblique
<PB N="40" REF="41">
Narration, employ'd in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Aeneid</HI>; where the Hero is introduc'd, at fir&s;t, near the Period of his De&s;igns, and afterwards &s;hows us, as it were in Per|&s;pective, the more di&s;tant Events and Cau&s;es. By this means, the Reader's Curio&s;ity is immediately excited: The Events follow with Rapidity, and in a very clo&s;e Connexion: And the Concern is pre&s;erv'd alive, and continually encrea&s;es, by means of the near Relation of the Objects, from the Beginning to the End of the Narration.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Rule takes place in dramatic Poetry; nor is it ever permitted, in a regular Compo&s;ition, to introduce an Actor, who has no Connexion, or but a &s;mall one, with the principal Per&s;onages of the Fable. The Spectator's Concern mu&s;t not be diverted by any Scenes, disjoin'd and &s;eparate from the re&s;t. This breaks the Cour&s;e of the Pa&s;&s;ions, and prevents that Communication of the &s;everal Emotions, by which one Scene adds Force to another, and transfu&s;es the Pity and Terror it excites upon each &s;ucceeding Scene, 'till the whole produces that Rapidity of Move|ment, which is peculiar to the Theatre. How mu&s;t it extingui&s;h this Warmth of Affection to be enter|tain'd, on a &s;udden, with a new Action and new Per&s;onages, no way related to the former; to find &s;o &s;en&s;ible a Breach or Vacuity in the Cour&s;e of the Pa&s;|&s;ions, by means of this Breach in the Connexion of Ideas; and in&s;tead of carrying the Sympathy of one
<PB N="41" REF="42">
Scene into the following, to be oblig'd, every Mo|ment, to excite a new Concern, and take Party in a new Scene of Action?</P>
<P>BUT tho' this Rule of Unity of Action be common to dramatic and epic Poetry; we may &s;till ob&s;erve a Difference betwixt them, which may, perhaps, de|&s;erve our Attention. In both the&s;e Species of Com|po&s;ition, tis requi&s;ite the Action be one and &s;imple, in order to pre&s;erve the Concern or Sympathy en|tire and undiverted: But in epic or narrative Poetry, this Rule is al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;h'd upon another Foundation, <HI>viz.</HI> the Nece&s;&s;ity, that is incumbent on every Writ|er, to form &s;ome Plan or De&s;ign, before he enter on any Di&s;cour&s;e or Narration, and to comprehend his Subject in &s;ome general A&s;pect or united View, which may be the con&s;tant Object of his Attention. As the Author is entirely lo&s;t in dramatic Compo&s;itions, and the Spectator &s;uppo&s;es him&s;elf to be really pre&s;ent at the Actions repre&s;ented; this Rea&s;on has no Place with regard to the Stage; but any Dialogue or Con|ver&s;ation may be introduc'd, which, without Impro|bability, might have pa&s;s'd in that determinate Portion of Space, repre&s;ented by the Theatre. Hence in all our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Comedies, even tho&s;e of <HI>Congreve,</HI> the Unity of Action is never &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd; but the Poet thinks it &s;ufficient, if his Per&s;onages be any way related to each other, by Blood, or by living in the &s;ame Family; and he afterwards introduces them in
<PB N="42" REF="43">
particular Scenes, where they di&s;play their Humours and Characters, without much forwarding the main Action. The double Plots of <HI>Terence</HI> are Licences of the &s;ame Kind; but in a le&s;&s;er Degree. And tho' this Conduct be not perfectly regular, it is not wholly un&s;uitable to the Nature of Comedy, where the Movements and Pa&s;&s;ions are not rais'd to &s;uch a height as in Tragedy; at the &s;ame time, that the Fiction or Repre&s;entation palliates, in &s;ome Degree, &s;uch Li|cences. In a narrative Poem, the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition or De&s;ign confines the Author to one Subject; and any Digre&s;&s;ions of this Nature would, at fir&s;t View, be rejected, as ab&s;urd and mon&s;trous. Neither <HI>Boccace, la Fontaine,</HI> nor any Author of that Kind, tho' Plea|&s;antry be their chief Object, have ever indulg'd them.</P>
<P>TO return to the Compari&s;on of Hi&s;tory and epic Poetry, we may conclude, from the foregoing Rea|&s;onings, that as a certain Unity is requi&s;ite in all Productions, it cannot be wanting to Hi&s;tory more than to any other; that in Hi&s;tory, the Connexion among the &s;everal Events, which unites them into one Body, is the Relation of Cau&s;e and Effect, the &s;ame which takes place in epic Poetry; and that in the latter Compo&s;ition, this Connexion is only re|quir'd to be clo&s;er and more &s;en&s;ible, on account of the lively Imagination and &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ions, which
<PB N="43" REF="44">
mu&s;t be touch'd by the Poet in his Narration. The <HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI> War is a proper Subject for Hi&s;tory, the Siege of <HI>Athens</HI> for an epic Poem, and the Death of <HI>Alcibiades</HI> for a Tragedy.</P>
<P>AS the Difference, therefore, betwixt Hi&s;tory and epic Poetry con&s;i&s;ts only in the Degrees of Connexion, which bind together tho&s;e &s;everal Events, of which their Subject is compos'd, 'twill be difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, by Words, to determine exactly the Bounds, which &s;eparate them from each other. That is a Matter of Ta&s;te more than of Rea&s;oning; and perhaps, this Unity may often be di&s;covered in a Sub|ject, where, at fir&s;t View, and from an ab&s;tract Con|&s;ideration, we &s;hould lea&s;t expect to find it.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that <HI>Homer,</HI> in the Cour&s;e of his Narration, exceeds the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition of his Subject; and that the Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> which caus'd the Death of <HI>Hector,</HI> is not the &s;ame with that which pro|duc'd &s;o many Ills to the <HI>Greeks.</HI> But the &s;trong Connexion betwixt the&s;e two Movements, the quick Tran&s;ition from one to the other, the Contra&s;te<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contra&s;te or Contrariety is a Species of Connexion among I|deas, which may, perhaps, be con&s;ider'd as a Species of Re&s;em|blance. Where two Objects are contrary, the one de&s;troys the other, <HI>i. e.</HI> is the Cau&s;e of its Annihilation, and the Idea of the Annihilation of an Object implies the Idea of its former Exi&s;t|ence.</NOTE> be|twixt the Effects of Concord and Di&s;cord among&s;t the
<PB N="44" REF="45">
Princes, and the natural Curio&s;ity we have to &s;ee <HI>Achilles</HI> in Action, after &s;o long Repo&s;e; all the&s;e Cau&s;es carry on the Reader, and produce a &s;ufficient Unity in the Subject.</P>
<P>IT may be objected to <HI>Milton,</HI> that he has trac'd up his Cau&s;es to too great a Di&s;tance, and that the Rebellion of the Angels produces the Fall of Man by a Train of Events, which is both very long and very ca&s;ual. Not to mention that the Creation of the World, which he has related at Length, is no more the Cau&s;e of that Cata&s;trophe, than of the Battle of <HI>Phar&s;alia,</HI> or any other Event, that has ever hap|pen'd. But if we con&s;ider, on the other hand, that all the&s;e Events, the Rebellion of the Angels, the Creation of the World, and the Fall of Man, <HI>re&s;emble</HI> each other, in being miraculous and out of the com|mon Cour&s;e of Nature; that they are &s;uppos'd to be <HI>contiguous</HI> in Time; and that being detach'd from all other Events, and being the only original Facts, which Revelation di&s;covers, they &s;trike the Eye at once, and naturally recall each other to the Thought or Imagi|nation: If we con&s;ider all the&s;e Circum&s;tances, I &s;ay, we &s;hall find, that the&s;e Parts of the Action have a &s;ufficient Unity to make them be comprehended in one Fable or Narration. To which we may add, that the Rebellion of the Angels and the Fall of Man have a peculiar Re&s;emblance as being Counterparts to each other, and pre&s;enting to the Reader, the &s;ame Moral, of Obedience to our Creator.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46">
THESE loo&s;e Hints I have thrown together, in or|der to excite the Curio&s;ity of Philo&s;ophers, and beget a Su&s;picion at lea&s;t, if not a full Per&s;ua&s;ion, that this Subject is very copious, and that many Operations of the human Mind depend on the Connexion or A&s;&s;o|ciation of Ideas, which is here explain'd. Particularly, the Sympathy betwixt the Pa&s;&s;ions and Imagination will, perhaps, appear remarkable; while we ob&s;erve that the Affections, excited by one Object, pa&s;s ea&s;ily to another connected with it; but transfu&s;e them&s;elves with Difficulty, or not at all, along different Objects, which have no manner of Connexion together. By introducing, into any Compo&s;ition, Per&s;onages and Actions, foreign to each other, an injudicious Author lo&s;es that Communication of Emotions, by which alone he can intere&s;t the Heart, and rai&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ions to their proper Height and Period. The full Expli|cation of this Principle and all its Con&s;equences would lead us into Rea&s;onings too profound and too copious for the&s;e E&s;&s;ays. 'Tis &s;ufficient for us, at pre&s;ent, to have e&s;tabli&s;h'd this Conclu&s;ion, that the three con|necting Principles of all Ideas are the Relations of <HI>Re|&s;emblance, Contiguity,</HI> and <HI>Cau&s;ation.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ESSAY IV. SCEPTICAL DOUBTS concerning the OPE|RATIONS of the UNDERSTANDING.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the Objects of human Rea&s;on or Enquiry may naturally be divided into two Kinds, <HI>viz. Relations of Ideas</HI> and <HI>Matters of Fact.</HI> Of the fir&s;t Kind are the Propo&s;itions in Geometry, Algebra, and Arithmetic; and in &s;hort, every Propo&s;ition, that is either intuitively or demon&s;tratively certain. <HI>That the Square of the Hypothenu&s;e is equal to the Squares of the two Sides,</HI> is a Propo&s;ition, that expre&s;&s;es a Rela|tion betwixt the&s;e Figures. <HI>That three times five is equal to the half of thirty,</HI> expre&s;&s;es a Relation betwixt the&s;e Numbers. Propo&s;itions of this Kind are di&s;co|verable by the mere Operation of Thought, without Dependance on what is any where exi&s;tent in the Uni|ver&s;e. Tho' there never were a true Circle or Tri|angle in Nature, the Propo&s;itions, demon&s;trated by
<PB N="48" REF="48">
<HI>Euclid,</HI> would for ever retain all their Truth and Evidence.</P>
<P>MATTERS of Fact, which are the &s;econd Objects of human Rea&s;on, are not a&s;certain'd to us in the &s;ame Manner; nor is our Evidence of their Truth, how|ever great, of a like Nature with the foregoing. The contrary of every Matter of Fact is &s;till po&s;&s;ible; be|cau&s;e it can never imply a Contradiction, and is con|ceiv'd by the Mind with equal Di&s;tinctne&s;s and Fa|cility, as if ever &s;o conformable to Truth and Reality. <HI>That the Sun will not ri&s;e To-morrow</HI> is no le&s;s intelli|gible a Propo&s;ition, and implies no more Contradic|tion, than the Affirmation, <HI>that it will ri&s;e.</HI> We &s;hould in vain, therefore, attempt to demon&s;trate its Fal&s;hood. Were it demon&s;tratively fal&s;e, it would imply a Contradiction, and could never be di&s;tinctly conceiv'd by the Mind.</P>
<P>IT may, therefore, be a Subject, worthy Curio&s;ity, to enquire what is the Nature of that Evidence, which a&s;&s;ures us of any real Exi&s;tence and Matter of Fact, beyond the pre&s;ent Te&s;timony of our Sen&s;es, or the Records of our Memory. This Part of Philo&s;ophy, 'tis ob&s;ervable, has been little cultivated, either by the Antients or Moderns; and therefore our Doubts and Errors, in the Pro&s;ecution of &s;o important an En|quiry, may be the more excu&s;able, while we mare
<PB N="49" REF="49">
thro' &s;uch difficult Paths, without any Guide or Di|rection. They may even prove u&s;eful, by exciting Curio&s;ity, and de&s;troying that implicite Faith and Se|curity, which is the Bane of all Rea&s;oning and free Enquiry. The Di&s;covery of Defects in the common Philo&s;ophy, if any &s;uch there be, will not, I pre&s;ume, be a Di&s;couragement, but rather an Incitement, as is u&s;ual, to attempt &s;omething more full and &s;atisfactory, than has yet been propos'd to the Public.</P>
<P>ALL Rea&s;onings concerning Matter of Fact &s;eem to be founded on the Relation of <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> and <HI>Effect.</HI> By Means of that Relation alone can we go beyond the Evidence of our Memory and Sen&s;es. If you were to a&s;k a Man, why he believes any Matter of Fact, which is ab&s;ent; for In&s;tance, that his Friend is in the Country, or in <HI>France</HI>; he would give you a Rea|&s;on; and this Rea&s;on would be &s;ome other Fact; as a Letter receiv'd from him, or the Knowledge of his former Re&s;olutions and Promi&s;es. A Man, finding a Watch or any other Machine in a de&s;ert I&s;land, would conclude, that there had once been Men in that I&s;land. All our Rea&s;onings concerning Fact are of the &s;ame Nature. And here 'tis con&s;tantly &s;uppos'd, that there is a Connexion betwixt the pre&s;ent Fact and that in|fer'd from it. Were there nothing to bind them to|gether, the Inference would be altogether precarious. The hearing of an articulate Voice and rational Di&s;|cour&s;e
<PB N="50" REF="50">
in the Dark a&s;&s;ures us of the Pre&s;ence of &s;ome Per&s;on: Why? Becau&s;e the&s;e are the Effects of the human Make and Fabric, and clo&s;ely connected with it. If we anatomize all the other Rea&s;onings of this Nature, we &s;hall find, that they are founded on the Relation of Cau&s;e and Effect, and that this Relation is either near or remote, direct or collateral. Heat and Light are collateral Effects of Fire, and the one Effect may ju&s;tly be infer'd from the other.</P>
<P>IF we would &s;atisfy our&s;elves, therefore, concern|ing the Nature of that Evidence, which a&s;&s;ures us of all Matters of Fact, we mu&s;t enquire how we arrive at the Knowledge of Cau&s;es and Effects.</P>
<P>I SHALL venture to affirm, as a general Propo&s;i|tion, which admits of no Exception, that the Know|ledge of this Relation of Cau&s;e and Effect is not, in any In&s;tance, attain'd by Rea&s;onings <HI>a priori</HI>; but ari&s;es entirely from Experience, when we find, that particular Objects are con&s;tantly conjoin'd with each other. Let any Object be pre&s;ented to a Man of ever &s;o &s;trong natural Rea&s;on and Abilities; if that Object be entirely new to him, he will never be able, by the mo&s;t accurate Examination of its &s;en&s;ible Quali|ties, to di&s;cover any of its Cau&s;es or Effects. <HI>Adam,</HI> tho' his rational Faculties be &s;uppos'd, at the very fir&s;t, ever &s;o perfect, could not have infer'd from the
<PB N="51" REF="51">
Fluidity and Tran&s;parency of Water, that it would &s;uffocate him, or from the Light and Warmth of Fire, that it would con&s;ume him. No Object ever di&s;covers, by the Qualities, which appear to the Sen&s;es, either the Cau&s;es, which produc'd it, or the Effects, which will ari&s;e from it; nor can our Rea&s;on, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by Experience, ever draw any Inferences concerning real Exi&s;tence and Matter of Fact.</P>
<P>THIS Propo&s;ition, <HI>that Cau&s;es and Effects are di&s;|coverable, not by Rea&s;on, but by Experience,</HI> will rea|dily be admitted with regard to &s;uch Objects, as we remember, to have been once altogether unknown to us; &s;ince we mu&s;t be con&s;cious of the utter Inability we then lay under of foretelling what would ari&s;e from them. Pre&s;ent two &s;mooth Pieces of Marble to a Man, who has no Tincture of natural Philo&s;ophy; and whatever Degree of Sen&s;e or Rea&s;on he may be endow'd with, he will never di&s;cover, that they will adhere together in &s;uch a Manner as to require great Force to &s;eparate them in a direct Line, while they make &s;o &s;mall Re&s;i&s;tance to a lateral Pre&s;&s;ure. Such Events, as bear little Analogy to the common Cour&s;e of Nature, are al&s;o readily acknowledged to be known only by Experience; nor does any Man imagine that the Explo&s;ion of Gunpowder, or the Attraction of a Load&s;tone could ever be di&s;cover'd by Arguments <HI>a priori.</HI> In like manner, when an Effect is &s;uppos'd
<PB N="52" REF="52">
to depend upon an intricate Machinery or &s;ecret Struc|ture, of Parts, we make no Difficulty to attribute all our Knowledge of it to Experience. Who will a&s;&s;ert, that he can give the ultimate Rea&s;on, why Milk or Bread is proper Nouri&s;hment for a Man, not for a Lyon or a Tyger?</P>
<P>BUT the &s;ame Truth may not appear, at fir&s;t View, to have the &s;ame Evidence with regard to Events, which have become familiar to us from our fir&s;t Ap|pearance in the World, which bear a clo&s;e Analogy to the whole Cour&s;e of Nature, and which are &s;up|pos'd to depend on the &s;imple Qualities of Objects, without any &s;ecret Structure of Parts. We are apt to imagine, that we could di&s;cover the&s;e Effects, by the mere Operations of our Rea&s;on, without Experience. We fancy, that, were we brought, of a &s;udden, into this World, we could at fir&s;t have infer'd, that one Billiard-ball would communicate Motion to another upon Impul&s;e; and that we needed not to have waited for the Event, in order to pronounce with Cer|tainty concerning it. Such is the Influence of Cu&s;|tom, that, where it is &s;tronge&s;t, it not only covers our natural Ignorance, but even conceals it&s;elf, and &s;eems not to take place, merely becau&s;e it is found in the highe&s;t Degree.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="53">
BUT to convince us, that all the Laws of Nature and all the Operations of Bodies, without Exception, are known only by Experience, the following Reflec|tions may, perhaps, &s;uffice. Were any Object pre|&s;ented to us, and were we requir'd to pronounce con|cerning the Effect, that will re&s;ult from it, without con&s;ulting pa&s;t Ob&s;ervation; after what Manner, I be&s;eech you, mu&s;t the Mind proceed in this Opera|tion? It mu&s;t invent or imagine &s;ome Event, which it a&s;cribes to the Object as its Effect; and 'tis plain this Invention mu&s;t be entirely arbitrary. It can ne|ver po&s;&s;ibly find the Effect in the &s;uppos'd Cau&s;e, by the mo&s;t accurate Scrutiny and Examination. For the Effect is totally different from the Cau&s;e, and con&s;e|quently can never be di&s;cover'd in it. Motion in the &s;econd Billiard-ball is a quite di&s;tinct Event from Mo|tion in the fir&s;t; nor is there any thing in the one to &s;ugge&s;t the &s;malle&s;t Hint of the other. A Stone or Piece of Metal rais'd into the Air, and left without any Support, immediately falls: But to con&s;ider the Matter <HI>a priori</HI>; is there any thing we di&s;cover in this Situation, which can beget the Idea of a down|ward, rather than an upward, or any other Motion, in the Stone or Metal?</P>

where we con&s;ult not Experience; &s;o mu&s;t we al&s;o e&s;teem the &s;uppos'd Tye or Connexion betwixt the Cau&s;e and Effect, which binds them together, and renders it impo&s;&s;ible, that any other Effect could re|&s;ult from the Operation of that Cau&s;e.

May not both the&s;e Balls remain at ab&s;olute Re&s;t? May not the fir&s;t Ball return in a &s;trait Line, or leap off from the &s;econd in any Line or Direction? All the&s;e Suppo&s;itions are con&s;i&s;tent and conceivable. Why then &s;hould we give the Preference to one, which is no more con&s;i&s;tent nor conceivable than the re&s;t?

<P>IN a word, then, every Effect is a di&s;tinct Event from its Cau&s;e.

And even after it is &s;ugge&s;ted, the Conjunction of it with the Cau&s;e mu&s;t appear equally arbitrary; &s;ince there are always many other Effects, which, to Rea&s;on, mu&s;t &s;eem fully as con&s;i&s;tent and natural. 'Twould,
<PB N="55" REF="55">
therefore, be in vain for us to pretend to determine any &s;ingle Event, or infer any Cau&s;e or Effect, with|out the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Ob&s;ervation and Experience.</P>
<P>HENCE we may di&s;cover the Rea&s;on, why no Phi|lo&s;opher, that has been rational and mode&s;t, has ever pretended to a&s;&s;ign the ultimate Cau&s;es of any of the Operations of Nature, or to &s;how di&s;tinctly the Actions of that Power, which produces any &s;ingle Ef|fect in the Univer&s;e. 'Tis confe&s;s'd, that the utmo&s;t Effort of human Rea&s;on is, to reduce the Principles, productive of natural Phaenomena, to a greater Sim|plicity, and to re&s;olve the many particular Effects into a few general Cau&s;es, by Means of Rea&s;onings from Analogy, Experience, and Ob&s;ervation. But as to the Cau&s;es of the&s;e general Cau&s;es, we &s;hould in vain attempt their Di&s;covery; nor &s;hall we ever be able to &s;atisfy our&s;elves, by any particular Explication of them. The&s;e ultimate Springs and Principles are to|tally &s;hut up from human Curio&s;ity and Enquiry. E|la&s;ticity, Gravity, Cohe&s;ion of Parts, Communica|tion of Motion by Impul&s;e; the&s;e are probably the ul|timate Cau&s;es and Principles we &s;hall ever di&s;cover in Nature; and we may e&s;teem our&s;elves &s;ufficiently happy, if, by accurate Enquiry and Rea&s;oning, we can trace up the particular Phaenomena to, or near to, the&s;e general Principles. The mo&s;t perfect Philo&s;o|phy of the natural Kind does only &s;tave off our Igno|rance
<PB N="56" REF="56">
a little longer: As perhaps the mo&s;t perfect Phi|lo&s;ophy of the moral or metaphy&s;ical Kind &s;erves only to di&s;cover larger Portions of our Ignorance. Thus the Ob&s;ervation of human Ignorance and Weakne&s;s is the Re&s;ult of all our Philo&s;ophy, and meets us, at every Turn, in &s;pite of our Endeavours to conquer, or avoid it.</P>
<P>NOR is Geometry, when taken into the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of natural Philo&s;ophy, ever able to remedy this De|fect, or lead us into the Knowledge of ultimate Cau&s;es, by all that Accuracy of Rea&s;oning, for which it is &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated. Every Part of mix'd Mathema|tics &s;till upon the Suppo&s;ition, that certain Laws are e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Nature in her Operations; and ab&s;tract Rea&s;onings are employ'd, either to a&s;&s;i&s;t Experience in the Di&s;covery of the&s;e Laws, or to de|termine their Influence in particular In&s;tances, where it depends upon any preci&s;e Degrees of Di&s;tance and Quantity. Thus 'tis a Law of Motion, di&s;cover'd by Experience, that the Moment or Force of any Body in Motion is in the compound Ratio or Proportion of its &s;olid Contents and its Velocity; and con&s;equently, that a &s;mall Force may remove the greate&s;t Ob&s;tacle or rai&s;e the greate&s;t Weight, if by any Contrivance or Machinery we can encrea&s;e the Velocity of that Force, &s;o as to make it an Overmatch for its Antagoni&s;t. Geometry a&s;&s;i&s;ts us in the Application of this Law, by
<PB N="57" REF="57">
giving us the ju&s;t Dimen&s;ions of all the Parts and Fi|gures, which can enter into any Species of Machine; but &s;till the Di&s;covery of the Law it&s;elf is owing merely to Experience, and all the ab&s;tract Rea&s;onings in the World could never lead us one Step towards the Knowledge of it. When we rea&s;on <HI>a priori,</HI> and con|&s;ider merely any Object or Cau&s;e, as it appears to the Mind, independent of all Ob&s;ervation, it never could &s;ugge&s;t to us the Notion of any di&s;tinct Object, &s;uch as its Effect; much le&s;s, &s;how us the in&s;eparable and inviolable Connexion betwixt them. A Man mu&s;t be very &s;agacious, who could di&s;cover by Rea|&s;oning, that Cry&s;tal is the Effect of Heat and Ice of Cold, without being previou&s;ly acquainted with the Operations of the&s;e Qualities.</P>

<P>BUT we have not, as yet, attain'd any tolerable Satisfaction with regard to the Que&s;tion fir&s;t propos'd. Each Solution &s;till gives ri&s;e to a new Que&s;tion as diffi|cult as the foregoing, and leads us on to farther En|quiries. When it is a&s;k'd, <HI>What is the Nature of all our Rea&s;onings concerning Matter of Fact?</HI> the proper An&s;wer &s;eems to be, that they are founded on the Relation of Cau&s;e and Effect.

<PB N="58" REF="58">
our &s;ifting and examining Humour, and a&s;k, <HI>What is the Foundation of all our Conclu&s;ions from Experience?</HI> this produces a new Que&s;tion, which may be of more difficult Solution and Explication. Philo&s;ophers, that give them&s;elves Airs of &s;uperior Wi&s;dom and Suffi|ciency, have a hard Ta&s;k, when they encounter Per|&s;ons of inqui&s;itive Di&s;po&s;itions, who pu&s;h them from every Corner, to which they retreat, and who are &s;ure at la&s;t to bring them to &s;ome dangerous Dilemma. The be&s;t Expedient to prevent this Confu&s;ion is to be mode&s;t in our Preten&s;ions; and even to di&s;cover the Difficulty our&s;elves before it is objected to us. By this Means, we may make a kind of Merit of our very Ignorance.</P>
<P>I SHALL content my&s;elf, in this E&s;&s;ay, with an ea&s;y Ta&s;k, and &s;hall pretend only to give a negative An&s;wer to the Que&s;tion here propos'd. I &s;ay then, that even after we have Experience of the Operations of Cau&s;e and Effect, our Conclu&s;ions from that Ex|perience are <HI>not</HI> founded on Rea&s;oning or any Proce&s;s of the Under&s;tanding. This An&s;wer we mu&s;t endea|vour, both to explain, and to defend.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t certainly be allow'd, that Nature has kept us at a great Di&s;tance from all her Secrets, and has afforded us only the Knowledge of a few &s;uperficial Qualities of Objects, while &s;he conceals from us tho&s;e
<PB N="59" REF="59">
Powers and Principles, on which the Influence of the&s;e Objects entirely depends. Our Sen&s;es inform us of the Colour, Weight, and Con&s;i&s;tence of Bread; but neither Sen&s;es nor Rea&s;on ever can inform us of tho&s;e Qualities, which fit it for the Nouri&s;hment and Support of a human Body. Sight or Feeling convey an Idea of the actual Motion of Bodies; but as to that wonderful Force or Power, which would carry on a moving Body for ever in a continu'd Change of Place, and which Bodies never lo&s;e but by communicating it to others; of this we cannot from the mo&s;t di&s;tant Conception. But notwith&s;tanding this Ignorance of natural Powers and Principles, we always pre&s;ume, where we &s;ee like &s;en&s;ible Qualities, that they have like &s;ecret Powers, and lay our Account, that Effects, &s;imilar to tho&s;e, which we have experienc'd, will fol|low from them. If a Body of like Colour and Con|&s;i&s;tence with that Bread, which we have formerly eat, be pre&s;ented to us, we make no Scruple of repeating the Experiment, and expect, with Certainty, like Nouri&s;hment and Support. Now this is a Proce&s;s of the Mind or Thought, of which I would willingly know the Foundation. 'Tis allow'd on all hands, that there is no known Connexion betwixt the &s;en&s;ible Qualities and the &s;ecret Powers; and con&s;equently, that the Mind is not led to form &s;uch a Conclu&s;ion con|cerning their con&s;tant and regular Conjunction, by any thing it knows of their Nature. As to pa&s;t <HI>Ex|perience,</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="60">
it can be allow'd to give <HI>direct</HI> and <HI>certain</HI> Information only of tho&s;e preci&s;e Objects, and that preci&s;e Period of Time, which fell under its Cogni|zance: But why this Experience &s;hould be extended to future Times, and to other Objects, which, for aught we know, may be only in Appearance &s;imilar; this is the main Que&s;tion I would in&s;i&s;t on. The Bread I formerly eat nouri&s;h'd me; that is, a Body, of &s;uch &s;en&s;ible Qualities, was, at that Time, endow'd with &s;uch &s;ecret Powers: But does it follow, that other Bread mu&s;t al&s;o nouri&s;h me at another Time, and that like &s;en&s;ible Qualities mu&s;t always be at|tended with like &s;ecret Powers? The Con&s;equence &s;eems no way nece&s;&s;ary. At lea&s;t, it mu&s;t be acknow|leg'd, that there is here a Con&s;equence drawn by the Mind; that there is a certain Step taken; a Proce&s;s of Thought, and an Inference, which wants to be ex|plain'd. The&s;e two Propo&s;itions are far from being the &s;ame, <HI>I have found that &s;uch an Object has always been attended with &s;uch an Effect,</HI> and <HI>I fore&s;ee, that other Objects, which are, to Appearance, &s;imilar, will be attended with &s;imilar Effects.</HI> I &s;hall allow, if you plea&s;e, that the one Propo&s;ition may ju&s;tly be infer'd from the other: I know in fact, that it always is in|fer'd. But if you in&s;i&s;t, that the Inference is made by a Chain of Rea&s;oning, I de&s;ire you may produce that Rea&s;oning. The Connexion betwixt the&s;e Propo&s;i|tions is not intuitive. There is requir'd a Medium, which may enable the Mind to draw &s;uch an Inference
<PB N="61" REF="61">
if indeed it be drawn by Rea&s;oning and Argument. What that Medium is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, pa&s;&s;es my Com|prehen&s;ion; and 'tis incumbent on tho&s;e to produce it, who a&s;&s;ert, that it really exi&s;ts, and is the Origin of all our Conclu&s;ions concerning Matter of Fact.</P>
<P>THIS negative Argument mu&s;t certainly, in Proce&s;s of Time, become altogether convincing, if many pe|netrating and able Philo&s;ophers &s;hall turn their En|quiries this Way; and no one be ever able to di&s;cover any connecting Propo&s;ition or intermediate Step, which &s;upports the Under&s;tanding in this Conclu&s;ion. But as the Que&s;tion is yet new, every Reader may not tru&s;t &s;o far to his own Penetration, as to conclude, be|cau&s;e an Argument e&s;capes his Re&s;earch and Enquiry, that therefore it does not really exi&s;t. For this Rea|&s;on it may be requi&s;ite to venture upon a more difficult Ta&s;k; and enumerating all the Branches of human Knowledge, endeavour to &s;how, that none of them can afford &s;uch an Argument.</P>
<P>ALL Rea&s;onings may be divided into two Kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> demon&s;trative Rea&s;onings, or tho&s;e concerning Relations of Ideas, and moral or probable Rea&s;onings, or tho&s;e concerning Matter of Fact and Exi&s;tence. That there are no demon&s;trative Arguments in the Ca&s;e, &s;eems evident; &s;ince it implies no Contradic|tion, that the Cour&s;e of Nature may change, and
<PB N="62" REF="62">
that Objects &s;eemingly like tho&s;e we have experienc'd may be attended with different or contrary Effects. May I not clearly and di&s;tinctly conceive, that a Body falling from the Clouds, and which, in all other re|&s;pects, re&s;embles Snow, has yet the Ta&s;te of Salt or Feeling of Fire? Is there any more intelligible Pro|po&s;ition than to affirm, that all the Trees flouri&s;h in <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January,</HI> and decay in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June?</HI> Now whatever is intelligible, and can be di&s;tinctly conceiv'd, implies no Contradiction, and can never be prov'd fal&s;e by any demon&s;trative Arguments or ab|&s;tract Rea&s;onings <HI>a priori.</HI></P>
<P>IF we be, therefore, engag'd by Arguments to put tru&s;t in pa&s;t Experience, and make it the Standard of our future Judgment, the&s;e Arguments mu&s;t be pro|bable only, or &s;uch as regard Matter of Fact and real Exi&s;tence, according to the Divi&s;ion above mention'd. But that there are no Arguments of this Kind, mu&s;t appear, if our Explication of that Species of Rea&s;on|ing be admitted as &s;olid and &s;atisfactory. We have &s;aid, that all Arguments concerning Exi&s;tence are founded on the Relation of Cau&s;e and Effect; that our Knowledge of that Relation is deriv'd entirely from Experience; and that all our experimental Conclu|&s;ions proceed upon the Suppo&s;ition, that the future will be conformable to the pa&s;t. To endeavour, therefore, the Proof of this la&s;t Suppo&s;ition by pro|bable
<PB N="63" REF="63">
Arguments, or Arguments regarding Exi&s;tence, mu&s;t be evidently going in a Circle, and taking that for granted, which is the very Point in Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>IN Reality, all Arguments from Experience are founded on the Similarity, which we di&s;cover among natural Objects, and by which we are induc'd to ex|pect Effects &s;imilar to tho&s;e, which we have found to follow from &s;uch Objects. And tho' none but a Fool or Madman will ever pretend to di&s;pute the Autho|rity of Experience, or to reject that great Guide of human Life; it may &s;urely be allow'd a Philo&s;opher to have &s;o much Curio&s;ity, at lea&s;t, as to examine the Principle of human Nature, which gives this mighty Authority to Experience, and makes us draw Advantage from that Similarity, which Nature has plac'd among different Objects. From Cau&s;es, which <HI>appear</HI> &s;imilar, we expect &s;imilar Effects. This is the Sum of all our experimental Conclu&s;ions. Now it &s;eems evident, that if this Conclu&s;ion were form'd by Rea&s;on, it would be as perfect at fir&s;t, and upon one In&s;tance, as after ever &s;o long a Cour&s;e of Experience. But the Ca&s;e is far otherwi&s;e. Nothing &s;o like as Eggs; yet no one, on account of this apparent Simi|larity, expects the &s;ame Ta&s;te and Reli&s;h in all of them. 'Tis only after a long Cour&s;e of uniform Ex|periments in any Kind, that we attain a firm Reliance and Security with regard to a particular Event. Now
<PB N="64" REF="64">
where is that Proce&s;s of Rea&s;oning, which from one In&s;tance draws a Conclu&s;ion, &s;o different from that which it infers from a hundred In&s;tances, that are no way different from that &s;ingle In&s;tance? This Que&s;tion I propo&s;e as much for the Sake of Information, as with an Intention of rai&s;ing Difficulties. I cannot find, I cannot imagine any &s;uch Rea&s;oning. But I keep my Mind &s;till open to In&s;truction, if any one will vouch&s;afe to be&s;tow it on me.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be &s;aid, that from a Number of uni|form Experiments, we <HI>infer</HI> a Connexion betwixt the &s;en&s;ible Qualities and the &s;ecret Powers; this, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;eems the &s;ame Difficulty, couch'd in diffe|rent Terms. The Que&s;tion &s;till recurs, On what Proce&s;s of Argument this <HI>Inference</HI> is founded? Where is the Medium, the interpo&s;ing Ideas, which join Pro|po&s;itions &s;o very wide of each other? 'Tis confe&s;s'd, that the Colour, Con&s;i&s;tence, and other &s;en&s;ible Qua|lities of Bread appear not, of them&s;elves, to have any Connexion with the &s;ecret Powers of Nouri&s;hment and Support. For otherwi&s;e we could infer the&s;e &s;ecret Powers from the fir&s;t Appearance of the&s;e &s;en&s;ible Qualities, without the Aid of Experience, contrary to the Sentiment of all Philo&s;ophers; and contrary to plain Matter of Fact. Here then is our natural State of Ignorance with regard to the Powers and Influence of all Objects. How is this remedy'd by Experience?
<PB N="65" REF="65">
It only &s;hews us a Number of uniform Effects, re&s;ult|ing from certain Objects, and teaches us, that tho&s;e particular Objects, at that particular Time, were en|dow'd with &s;uch Powers and Forces. When a new Object of &s;imilar &s;en&s;ible Qualities is produc'd, we ex|pect &s;imilar Powers and Forces, and lay our Account with a like Effect. From a Body of a like Colour and Con&s;i&s;tence with Bread, we look for like Nouri&s;hment and Support. But this &s;urely is a Step or Progre&s;s of the Mind, which wants to be explain'd. When a Man &s;ays, <HI>I have found, in all pa&s;t In&s;tances, &s;uch &s;en|&s;ible Qualities, conjoin'd with &s;uch &s;ecret Powers:</HI> And when he &s;ays, <HI>&s;imilar &s;en&s;ible Qualities will always be conjoin'd with &s;imilar &s;ecret Powers</HI>; he is not guilty of a Tautology, nor are the&s;e Propo&s;itions in any re|&s;pect the &s;ame. You &s;ay the one Propo&s;ition is an In|ference from the other. But you mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the Inference is not intuitive; neither is it demon&s;tra|tive: Of what Nature is it then? To &s;ay it is experi|mental is begging the Que&s;tion. For all Inferences from Experience &s;uppo&s;e, as their Foundation, that the future will re&s;emble the pa&s;t, and that &s;imilar Pow|ers will be conjoin'd with &s;imilar &s;en&s;ible Qualities. If there be any Su&s;picion, that the Cour&s;e of Nature may change, and that the pa&s;t may be no Rule for the future, all Experience becomes u&s;ele&s;s, and can give ri&s;e to no Inferences or Conclu&s;ions. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, that any Arguments from Experience can
<PB N="66" REF="66">
prove this Re&s;emblance of the pa&s;t to the future; &s;ince all the&s;e Arguments are founded on the Suppo|&s;ition of that Re&s;emblance. Let the Cour&s;e of Things be allow'd hitherto never &s;o regular; that alone, with|out &s;ome new Argument or Inference, proves not, that, for the future, it will continue &s;o. In vain do you pretend to have learnt the Nature of Bodies from your pa&s;t Experience. Their &s;ecret Nature, and con|&s;equently, all their Effects and Influence may change, without any Change in their &s;en&s;ible Qualities. This happens &s;ometimes, and with regard to &s;ome Objects: Why may it not happen always, and with regard to all Objects? What Logic, what Proce&s;s of Argument &s;ecures you again&s;t this Suppo&s;ition? My Practice, you &s;ay, refutes my Doubts. But you mi&s;take the Purport of my Que&s;tion. As an Agent, I am quite &s;atisfy'd in the Point: But as a Philo&s;opher, who has &s;ome Share of Curio&s;ity, I will not &s;ay Sceptici&s;m, I want to learn the Foundation of this Inference. No Reading, no Enquiry has yet been able to remove my Difficulty, or give me Satisfaction in a Matter of &s;uch va&s;t Importance. Can I do better than propo&s;e the Difficulty to the Public, even tho', perhaps, I have &s;mall Hopes of obtaining a Solution? We &s;hall at lea&s;t, by this Means, be &s;en&s;ible of our Ignorance, if we do not augment our Knowledge.</P>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s, that a Man is guilty of unpardo|nable Arrogance, who concludes, becau&s;e an Argu|ment
<PB N="67" REF="67">
has e&s;cap'd his own Inve&s;tigation and Enquiry, that therefore it does not really exi&s;t. I mu&s;t al&s;o confe&s;s, that tho' all the Learned, for &s;everal Ages, &s;hould have employ'd their Time in fruitle&s;s Search upon any Subject, it may &s;till perhaps, be ra&s;h to conclude po&s;itively, that the Subject mu&s;t, therefore, pa&s;s all human Comprehen&s;ion. Even tho' we ex|amine all the Sources of our Knowledge, and conclude them unfit for &s;uch a Subject, there may &s;till remain a Su&s;picion, that the Enumeration is not compleat, or the Examination not accurate. But with regard to the pre&s;ent Subject, there are &s;ome Con&s;iderations, which &s;eem to remove all this Accu&s;ation of Arro|gance or Su&s;picion of Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>'TIS certain, that the mo&s;t ignorant and &s;tupid Pea|&s;ants, nay Infants, nay even brute Bea&s;ts improve by Experience, and learn the Qualities of natural Ob|jects, by ob&s;erving the Effects, which re&s;ult from them. When a Child has felt the Sen&s;ation of Pain from touching the Flame of a Candle, he will be care|ful not to put his Hand near any Candle; but will expect a &s;imilar Effect from a Cau&s;e, which is &s;imilar to its &s;en&s;ible Qualities and Appearance. If you a&s;|&s;ert, therefore, that the Under&s;tanding of the Child is led into this Conclu&s;ion by any Proce&s;s of Argument or Ratiocination, I may ju&s;tly require you to produce that Argument; nor have you any Pretext to refu&s;e &s;o
<PB N="68" REF="68">
equitable a Demand. You cannot &s;ay, that the Ar|gument is ab&s;tru&s;e, and may po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape your Search and Enquiry; &s;ince you confe&s;s, that it is ob|vious to the Capacity of a mere Infant. If you he&s;i|tate, therefore, a Moment, or if, after Reflection, you produce any intricate and profound Argument, you, in a Manner, give up the Que&s;tion, and confe&s;s, that it is not Rea&s;oning, which engages us to &s;uppo&s;e the pa&s;t re&s;embling the future, and to expect &s;imilar Ef|fects from Cau&s;es, which are, to Appearance, &s;imilar. This is the Propo&s;ition, which I intended to enforce by the pre&s;ent E&s;&s;ay. If I be right, I pretend to have made no mighty Di&s;covery. And if I be wrong, I mu&s;t acknowledge my&s;elf to be indeed a very backward Scholar; &s;ince I cannot now di&s;cover an Argument, which, it &s;eems, was perfectly familiar to me, long before I was out of my Cradle.</P>

The Academics talk always of Doubts and Su&s;pen&s;e of Judgment, of Danger in ha&s;ty Determi|nations, of confining to very narrow Bounds the En|quiries of the Under&s;tanding, and of renouncing all Speculations that lie not within the Limits of common Life and Practice. Nothing, therefore, can be more contrary than &s;uch a Philo&s;ophy to the &s;upine Indo|lence of the Mind, its ra&s;h Arrogance, its lofty Pre|ten&s;ions, and its &s;uper&s;titious Credulity. Every Pa&s;|&s;ion is mortify'd by it, except the Love of Truth; and that Pa&s;&s;ion never is, nor can be carry'd to too high a Degree. 'Tis &s;urpri&s;ing, therefore, that this Philo&s;ophy, which, in almo&s;t every In&s;tance, mu&s;t be harmle&s;s and innocent, &s;hould be the Subject of &s;o much groundle&s;s Reproach and Obloquy. But, per|haps, the very Circum&s;tance, which renders it &s;o in|nocent, is what chiefly expo&s;es it to the public Hatred
<PB N="71" REF="71">
and Re&s;entment. By flattering no irregular Pa&s;&s;ion, it gains few Partizans: By oppo&s;ing &s;o many Vices and Follies, it rai&s;es to it&s;elf abundance of Enemies, who &s;tigmatize it as libertine, prophane, and irre|ligious.</P>
<P>NOR need we fear, that this Philo&s;ophy, while it endeavours to limit our Enquiries to common Life, &s;hould ever undermine the Rea&s;onings of common Life, and carry its Doubts &s;o far as to de&s;troy all Ac|tion, as well as Speculation. Nature will always maintain her Rights, and prevail in the End over any ab&s;tract Rea&s;oning what&s;oever. Tho' we &s;hould con|clude, for In&s;tance, as in the foregoing E&s;&s;ay, that, in all Rea&s;onings from Experience, there is a Step taken by the Mind, which is not &s;upported by any Argument or Proce&s;s of the Under&s;tanding; there is no Danger, that the&s;e Rea&s;onings, on which almo&s;t all Knowledge depends, will ever be affected by &s;uch a Di&s;covery. If the Mind be not engag'd by Argu|ment to make this Step, it mu&s;t be induc'd by &s;ome other Principle of equal Weight and Authority; and that Principle will pre&s;erve its Influence as long as hu|man Nature remains the &s;ame. What that Principle is, may well be worth the Pains of Enquiry.</P>

<P>THIS Principle is CUSTOM or HABIT.

We only point out a Principle of human Nature, which is univer|&s;ally acknowledg'd, and which is well known by its Effects. Perhaps, we can pu&s;h our Enquiries no far|ther, or pretend to give the Cau&s;e of this Cau&s;e; but mu&s;t re&s;t contented with it as the ultimate Principle, which we can a&s;&s;ign, of all our Conclu&s;ions from Ex|perience. 'Tis &s;ufficient Satisfaction, that we can go &s;o far; without repining at the Narrowne&s;s of our Fa|culties, becau&s;e they will carry us no farther.

are determin'd by Cu&s;tom alone to expect the one from the Appearance of the other. This Hypothe&s;is &s;eems even the only one, which explains the Diffi|culty, why we draw an Inference from a thou&s;and In|&s;tances, which we are not able to draw from one In|&s;tance, that is, in no re&s;pect, different from them. Rea&s;on is incapable of any &s;uch Variation. The Con|clu&s;ions it draws from con&s;idering one Circle are the &s;ame, which it would form upon &s;urveying all the Circles in the Univer&s;e. But no Man, having &s;een only one Body move after being impell'd by another, could infer, that every other Body will move after a like Impul&s;e. All Inferences from Experience, there|fore, are Effects of Cu&s;tom, not of Rea&s;oning<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Nothing is more u&s;ual than for Writers even on <HI>moral, political,</HI> or <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> Subjects, to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI> and to &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e Species of Argumentation are entirely different from each other. The former are taken for the mere Re&s;ult of our intellectual Faculties, which, by con|&s;idering <HI>a priori</HI> the Nature of Things, and examining the Ef|fects, that mu&s;t follow from their Operation, e&s;tabli&s;h particular Principles of Science and Philo&s;ophy. The latter are &s;uppos'd to be deriv'd entirely from Sen&s;e and Ob&s;ervation, by which we learn what has actually re&s;ulted from the Operation of particular Ob|jects, and are thence able to infer what will, for the future, re|&s;ult from them. Thus, for In&s;tance, the Limitations and Re|&s;traints of civil Government and a legal Con&s;titution may be de|fended, either from <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> which, reflecting on the great Frailty and Corruption of human Nature, teaches, that no Man can &s;afely be tru&s;ted with unlimited Authority; or from <HI>Experience</HI> and Hi&s;tory, which inform us of the enormous Abu&s;es, that Am|bition, in every Age and Country, has been found to make of &s;o imprudent a Confidence.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Di&s;tinction betwixt Rea&s;on and Experience is main|tain'd in all our Deliberations concerning the Conduct of Life; while the experienc'd State&s;man, General, Phy&s;ician, or Mer|chant is tru&s;ted and follow'd; and the unpractic'd Novice, with whatever natural Talents endow'd, neglected and de&s;pis'd. Tho' it be allow'd, that Rea&s;on may form very plau&s;ible Conjectures with regard to the Con&s;equences of &s;uch a particular Conduct in &s;uch particular Circum&s;tances; 'tis &s;till &s;uppos'd imperfect, with|out the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Experience, which is alone able to give Stability and Certainty to the Maxims, deriv'd from Study and Reflection.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding that this Di&s;tinction be thus univer&s;ally receiv'd, both in the active and &s;peculative Scenes of Life, I &s;hall not &s;cruple to pronounce, that, in my Opinion, it is, at the Bottom, erroneous, or at lea&s;t, &s;uperficial.</P>
<P>If we examine tho&s;e Arguments, which, in any of the Sci|ences above mentioned, are &s;uppos'd to be the mere Effects of Rea|&s;oning and Reflection, they will all be found to terminate, at la&s;t, in &s;ome general Principle or Conclu&s;ion, for which we can a&s;&s;ign no Rea&s;on but Ob&s;ervation and Experience. The only Dif|ference betwixt them and tho&s;e Maxims, which are vulgarly e&s;teem'd the Re&s;ult of pure Experience, is, that the former can|not be e&s;tabli&s;h'd without &s;ome Proce&s;s of Thought, and &s;ome Reflection on what we have ob&s;erv'd, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h its Circum&s;tances, and trace its Con&s;equences: Whereas in the latter the experienc'd Event is exactly and fully &s;imilar to that which we infer as the Re&s;ult of any particular Situation. The Hi&s;tory of a <HI>Tiberius</HI> or a <HI>Nero</HI> makes us dread a like Tyranny were our Monarchs freed from the Re&s;traints of Laws and Senates: But the Ob&s;ervation of any Fraud or Cruelty in private Life is &s;ufficient, with the Aid of a little Thought, to give us the &s;ame Appre|hen&s;ion; while it &s;erves as an In&s;tance of the general Corruption of human Nature, and &s;hows us the Danger we mu&s;t incur by repo&s;ing an entire Confidence in Mankind. 'Tis Experience, in both Ca&s;es, which is ultimately the Foundation of our Inference and Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is no Man &s;o young and unexperienc'd, as not to have form'd, from Ob&s;ervation, many general and ju&s;t Maxims con|cerning human Affairs and the Conduct of Life; but it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that, when he comes to put the&s;e in Practice, he will be extremely liable to Error, till Time and farther Experience, both enlarge the&s;e Maxims, and teach him their proper U&s;e and Application. In every Situation or Incident, there are many particular and &s;eemingly minute Circum&s;tances, which the Man of greate&s;t Talents is, at fir&s;t, apt to overlook, tho' on them the Ju&s;tne&s;s of his Conclu&s;ions, and con&s;equently, the Prudence of his Conduct, entirely depend. Not to mention, that, to a young Beginner, the general Ob&s;ervations and Maxims occur not always on the proper Occa&s;ions, nor can be immediately apply'd with due Calmne&s;s and Di&s;tinction. The Truth is, an unexperienc'd Rea&s;oner could be no Rea&s;oner at all, were he ab&s;olutely unex|perienc'd; and when we a&s;&s;ign that Character to any one, we mean it only in a comparative Sen&s;e, and &s;uppo&s;e him po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of Experience in a &s;maller and more imperfect Degree.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="75">CUSTOM, then, is the great Guide of human Life. 'Tis that Principle alone, which renders our Expe|rience
<PB N="76" REF="76">
u&s;eful to us, and makes us expect for the fu|ture a &s;imilar Train of Events with tho&s;e which have
<PB N="77" REF="77">
appear'd in the pa&s;t. Without the Influence of Cu&s;|tom, we &s;hould be entirely ignorant of every Matter of Fact, beyond what is immediately pre&s;ent to the Memory and Sen&s;es. We &s;hould never know how to adju&s;t Means to Ends, or to employ our natural Powers in the Production of any Effect. There would be an End at once of all Action, as well as of the chief Part of Speculation.</P>
<P>BUT here it may be proper to remark, that tho' our Conclu&s;ions from Experience carry us beyond our Memory and Sen&s;es, and a&s;&s;ure us of Matters of Fact, which happen'd in the mo&s;t di&s;tant Places and mo&s;t remote Ages; yet &s;ome Fact mu&s;t always be pre&s;ent to the Sen&s;es or Memory, from which we may fir&s;t proceed in drawing the&s;e Conclu&s;ions. A Man, who &s;hould find in a de&s;ert Country the Remains of pomp|ous Buildings, would conclude, that the Country had, in antient Times, been cultivated by civiliz'd Inha|bitants; but did nothing of this Nature occur to him, he could never be able to form &s;uch an Inference. We learn the Events of former Ages from Hi&s;tory; but then we mu&s;t peru&s;e the Volumes, in which this In&s;truction is contain'd, and thence carry up our Infe|rences from one Te&s;timony to another, till we arrive at the Eye-witne&s;&s;es and Spectators of the&s;e di&s;tant Events. In a word, if we proceed not upon &s;ome Fact, pre&s;ent to our Memory or Sen&s;es, our Rea&s;on|ings would be merely hypothetical; and however the
<PB N="78" REF="78">
particular Links might be connected with each other, the whole Chain of Inferences would have nothing to &s;upport it, nor could we ever, by its Means, arrive at the Knowledge of any real Exi&s;tence. If I a&s;k, why you believe any particular Matter of Fact, which you re|late, you mu&s;t tell me &s;ome Rea&s;on; and this Rea&s;on will be &s;ome other Fact, connected with it: But as you cannot proceed after this Manner, <HI>in infinitum,</HI> you mu&s;t at la&s;t terminate in &s;ome Fact, which is pre&s;ent to your Memory or Sen&s;es; or mu&s;t allow, that your Belief is entirely without Foundation.</P>
<P>WHAT then is the Conclu&s;ion of the whole Matter? A &s;imple one; tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, pretty remote from the common Theories of Philo&s;ophy. All Be|lief of Matter of Fact or real Exi&s;tence is deriv'd merely from &s;ome Object, pre&s;ent to the Memory or Sen&s;es, and a cu&s;tomary Conjunction betwixt that and any other Object. Or in other Words; having found, in many In&s;tances, that any two Kinds of Objects, Flame and Heat, Snow and Cold, have always been conjoin'd together; if Flame or Snow be pre&s;ented anew to our Sen&s;es; the Mind is carry'd by Cu&s;tom to expect Heat or Cold, and to <HI>believe,</HI> that &s;uch a Qua|lity does exi&s;t, and will di&s;cover it&s;elf upon a nearer Approach. This Belief is the nece&s;&s;ary Re&s;ult of placing the Mind in &s;uch Circum&s;tances. 'Tis an Operation of the Soul, when we are &s;o &s;ituated, as
<PB N="79" REF="79">
unavoidable as to feel the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love, when we receive Benefits, or Hatred, when we meet with In|juries. All the&s;e Operations are a Species of natural In&s;tincts, which no Rea&s;on or Proce&s;s of the Thought and Under&s;tanding is able, either to produce, or to prevent.</P>
<P>AT this Point, 'twould be very allowable for us to &s;top our philo&s;ophical Re&s;earches. In mo&s;t Que&s;tions, we can never make a &s;ingle Step farther; and in all Que&s;tions, we mu&s;t terminate here at la&s;t, after our mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s and curious Enquiries. But &s;till our Cu|rio&s;ity will be pardonable, perhaps commendable, if it carry us on to &s;till farther Re&s;earches, and make us examine more accurately the Nature of this <HI>Belief,</HI> and of the <HI>cu&s;tomary Conjunction,</HI> whence it is deriv'd. By this Means, we may meet with &s;ome Explications and Analogies, that will give Satisfaction; at lea&s;t to &s;uch as love the ab&s;tract Sciences, and can be enter|tain'd with Speculations, which, however accurate, may &s;till retain a Degree of Doubt and Uncertainty. As to Readers of a different Ta&s;te; the remaining Part of this E&s;&s;ay is not calculated for them, and the following E&s;&s;ays may well be under&s;tood, tho' it be neglected.</P>

<P>THERE is nothing more free than the Imagination of Man; and tho' it cannot exceed that original Stock of Ideas, which is furni&s;h'd by our internal and exter|nal Sen&s;es, it has unlimited Power of mixing, com|pounding, &s;eparating and dividing the&s;e Ideas, to all the Varieties of Fiction and Vi&s;ion. It can feign a Train of Events, with all the Appearance of Reality, a&s;cribe to them a particular Time and Place, conceive them as exi&s;tent, and paint them out to it&s;elf with every Circum&s;tance, that belongs to any hi&s;torical Fact, which it believes with the greate&s;t Certainty. Wherein, therefore, con&s;i&s;ts the Difference betwixt &s;uch a Fiction and Belief? It lies not merely in any peculiar Idea, which is annex'd to a Conception, that commands our a&s;&s;ent, and which is wanting to every known Fiction. For as the Mind has Authority over all its Ideas, it could voluntarily annex this par|ticular Idea to any Fiction, and con&s;equently be able to believe whatever it plea&s;es; contrary to what we find by daily Experience. We can, in our Conception, join the Head of a Man to the Body of a Hor&s;e; but it is not in our Power to believe, that &s;uch an Animal has ever really exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>IT follows, therefore, that the Difference betwixt <HI>Fiction</HI> and <HI>Belief</HI> lies in &s;ome Sentiment or Feeling,
<PB N="81" REF="81">
which is annex'd to the latter, not to the former, and which depends not on the Will, nor can be com|manded at Plea&s;ure. It mu&s;t be excited by Nature, like all other Sentiments; and mu&s;t ari&s;e from the particular Situation, in which the Mind is plac'd at any particular Juncture. Whenever any Object is pre&s;ented to the Memory or Sen&s;es, it immediately, by the Force of Cu&s;tom, carries the Imagination to conceive that Object, which is u&s;ually conjoin'd to it; and this Conception is attended with a Feeling or Sen|timent, different from the loo&s;e Reveries of the Fancy. Herein con&s;i&s;ts the whole Nature of Belief. For as there is no Matter of Fact we believe &s;o firmly, that we cannot conceive the contrary, there would be no Difference betwixt the Conception a&s;&s;ented to, and that which is rejected, were it not for &s;ome Sentiment, that di&s;tingui&s;hes the one from the other. If I &s;ee a Billiard-Ball moving towards another, on a &s;mooth Table, I can ea&s;ily conceive it to &s;top upon Contact. This Conception implies no Contradiction; but &s;till it feels very differently from that Conception, by which I repre&s;ent to my&s;elf the Impul&s;e, and the Com|munication of Motion from one Ball to another.</P>
<P>WERE we to attempt a Definition or De&s;cription of this Sentiment, we &s;hould, perhaps, find it a very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible Ta&s;k; in the &s;ame Manner as if we &s;hould endeavour to define the Feeling of
<PB N="82" REF="82">
Cold or Pa&s;&s;ion of Anger, to &s;uch as never had an Ex|perience of the&s;e Sentiments. BELIEF is the true and proper Name of this Feeling; and no one is ever at a lo&s;s to know the Meaning of that Term; becau&s;e every Man is every Moment con&s;cious of the Senti|timent, repre&s;ented by it. It may not, however, be improper to attempt a <HI>De&s;cription</HI> of this Sentiment; in hopes we may, by that means, arrive at &s;ome Ana|logies, that may afford a more perfect Explication of it. I &s;ay then, that Belief is nothing but a more vivid, lively, forcible, firm, &s;teady Conception of an Object, than what the Imagination alone is ever able to attain. This Variety of Terms, which may &s;eem &s;o unphilo&s;ophical, is intended only to expre&s;s that Act of the Mind, which renders Realities, or what is taken for &s;uch, more pre&s;ent to us than Fictions, cau&s;es them to weigh more in the Thought, and gives them a &s;uperior Influence on the Pa&s;&s;ions and Imagi|nation. Provided we agree about the Thing, 'tis needle&s;s to di&s;pute about the Terms. The Imagina|tion has the Command over all its Ideas, and can join and mix and vary them, in all the Ways po&s;&s;ible. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> may conceive fictitious Objects with all the Circum+&s;tances of Place and Time.

But as it is impo&s;&s;ible that that Faculty of Imagination can ever, of it&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> teach Belief; 'tis evident, that Belief con&s;i&s;ts not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the peculiar Nature or Order of Ideas, but in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="83" REF="83">
<HI>Manner</HI> of their Conception, and in their <HI>Feeling</HI> to the Mind. I confe&s;s, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible perfectly to explain this Feeling or Manner of Conception. We may make u&s;e of Words, that expre&s;s &s;omething near it. But its true and proper Name, as we ob&s;erv'd be|fore, is <HI>Belief</HI>; which is a Term, that every one &s;uf|ficiently under&s;tands in common Life. And in Phi|lo&s;ophy, we can go no farther than a&s;&s;ert, that <HI>Belief</HI> is &s;omething felt by the Mind, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the Ideas of the Judgment from the Fictions of the Imagination. It gives them more Force and Influ|ence; makes them appear of greater Importance; inforces them in the Mind, and renders them the go|verning Principle of all our Actions. I hear at pre|&s;ent, for In&s;tance, a Per&s;on's Voice, whom I am ac|quainted with; and this Sound comes as from the next Room. This Impre&s;&s;ion of my Sen&s;es imme|diately conveys my Thoughts to the Per&s;on, along with all the &s;urrounding Objects. I paint them out to my&s;elf as exi&s;ting at pre&s;ent, with the &s;ame Qua|lities and Relations, that I formerly knew them po&s;|&s;e&s;t of. The&s;e Ideas take &s;a&s;ter hold of my Mind, than Ideas of an inchanted Ca&s;tle. They are very different to the Feeling, and have a much greater In|fluence of every Kind, either to give Plea&s;ure or Pain, Joy or Sorrow.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="84">
LET us, then, take in the whole Compa&s;s of this Doctrine, and allow, that the Sentiment of Belief is nothing but a Conception of an Object more inten&s;e and &s;teady than what attends the mere Fictions of the Imagination, and that this <HI>Manner</HI> of Conception ari&s;es from a cu&s;tomary Conjunction of the Object with &s;omething pre&s;ent to the Memory or Sen&s;es: I believe it will not be difficult, upon the&s;e Suppo&s;itions, to find other Operations of the Mind analogous to it, and to trace up the&s;e Phaenomena to Principles &s;till more general.</P>
<P>WE have already ob&s;erv'd, that Nature has e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Connexions among particular Ideas, and that no &s;ooner one occurs to our Thoughts than it intro|duces its correlative, and carries our Attention towards it, by a gentle and in&s;en&s;ible Movement. The&s;e Principles of Connexion or A&s;&s;ociation we have re|duc'd to three, <HI>viz. Re&s;emblance, Contiguity,</HI> and <HI>Cau&s;ation</HI>; which are the only Bonds, that unite our Thoughts together, and beget that regular. Train of Reflection or Di&s;cour&s;e, which, in a greater or le&s;&s;er Degree, takes place among&s;t all Mankind. Now here ari&s;es a Que&s;tion, on which the Solution of the pre&s;ent Difficulty will depend. Does it happen, in all the&s;e Relations, that when one of the Objects is pre|&s;ented to the Sen&s;es or Memory, the Mind is not only carry'd to the Conception of the Correlative, but reaches a &s;teadier and &s;tronger Conception of it than
<PB N="85" REF="85">
what otherwi&s;e it would have been able to attain? This &s;eems to be the Ca&s;e with that Belief, which a|ri&s;es from the Relation of Cau&s;e and Effect. And if the Ca&s;e be the &s;ame with the other Relations or Principles of A&s;&s;ociation, we may e&s;tabli&s;h this as a general Law, that takes place in all the Operations of the Mind.</P>
<P>WE may, therefore, ob&s;erve, as the fir&s;t Experi|ment to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, that upon the Appear|ance of the Picture of an ab&s;ent Friend, our Idea of him is evidently enliven'd by the <HI>Re&s;emblance,</HI> and that every Pa&s;&s;ion, which that Idea occa&s;ions, whether of Joy or Sorrow, acquires new Force and Vigour|&s;n producing this Effect, there concur both a Relation and a pre&s;ent Impre&s;&s;ion. Where the Picture bears him no Re&s;emblance, or at lea&s;t was not intended for him, it never &s;o much as conveys our Thought to him: And where it is ab&s;ent, as well as the Per&s;on; tho' the Mind may pa&s;s from the Thought of the one to that of the other; it feels its Idea to be rather weaken'd than enliven'd by that Tran&s;ition. We take a Plea&s;ure in viewing the Picture of a Friend, when 'tis &s;et before us; but when 'tis remov'd, rather chu&s;e to con&s;ider him directly, than by Reflexion in an image, which is equally di&s;tant and ob&s;cure.</P>

The Devotees of that &s;trange Super&s;tition u&s;ually plead in Excu&s;e of the Mummeries, with which they are upbraided, that they feel the good Effect of tho&s;e ex|ternal Motions, and Po&s;tures, and Actions, in en|livening their Devotion and quickning their Fervour, which otherwi&s;e would decay away, if directed en|tirely to di&s;tant and immaterial Objects.

NO one can doubt but Cau&s;ation has the &s;ame In|fluence as the other two Relations of Re&s;emblance and Contiguity. Super&s;titious People are fond of the Re|licts of Saints and holy Men, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, that they &s;eek after Types or Images, in order to en|liven their Devotion, and give them a more intimate and &s;trong Conception of tho&s;e exemplary Lives, which they de&s;ire to imitate. Now 'tis evident one of the be&s;t Relicts a Devotee could procure would be the Handywork of a Saint; and if his Cloaths and Fur|niture are ever to be con&s;ider'd in this Light, 'tis be|cau&s;e they were once at his Di&s;po&s;al, and were mov'd and affected by him; in which Re&s;pect they are to be con&s;ider'd as imperfect Effects, and as connected with him by a &s;horter Chain of Con&s;equences than any of tho&s;e, by which we learn the Reality of his Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the Son of a Friend, who had been long dead or ab&s;ent, were pre&s;ented to us; 'tis evident, that this Object would in&s;tantly revive its correlative Idea, and recall to our Thoughts all our pa&s;t Inti|macies and Familiarities in more lively Colours than they would otherwi&s;e have appear'd to us. This is another Phaenomenon, which &s;eems to prove the Prin|ciple above mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="89">
WE may ob&s;erve, that in the&s;e Phaenomena the Belief of the correlative Object is always pre-&s;uppos'd; without which the Relation could have no Effect in inlivening the Idea. The Influence of the Picture &s;uppo&s;es, that we <HI>believe</HI> our Friend to have once ex|i&s;ted. Contiguity to Home can never excite our Ideas of Home, unle&s;s we <HI>believe</HI> that it really exi&s;ts. Now I a&s;&s;ert, that this Belief, where it reaches beyond the Memory or Sen&s;es, is of a &s;imilar Nature, and ari&s;es from &s;imilar Cau&s;es, with the Tran&s;ition of Thought and Vivacity of Conception here explain'd. When I throw a Piece of dry Wood into a Fire, my Mind is immediately carry'd to conceive, that its augments, not extingui&s;hes the Flame. This Tran&s;ition of Thought from the Cau&s;e to the Effect proceeds not from Rea|&s;on. It derives its Origin altogether from Cu&s;tom and Experience. And as it fir&s;t begins from an Object, pre&s;ent to the Sen&s;es, it renders the Idea or Concep|tion of Flame more &s;trong and lively than any loo&s;e, floating Reverie of the Imagination. That Idea ari&s;es immediately. The Thought pa&s;&s;es in&s;tantly to it, and conveys to it all that Force of Conception, which is deriv'd from the Impre&s;&s;ion pre&s;ent to the Sen&s;es. When a Sword is level'd at my Brea&s;t, does not the Idea of Wound and Pain &s;trike me more &s;trongly, than when a Gla&s;s of Wine is pre&s;ented to me, even tho' by Accident this Idea &s;hould be pre|&s;ented
<PB N="90" REF="90">
after the Appearance of the latter Object? But what is there in this whole Matter to cau&s;e &s;uch a &s;trong Conception, but only a pre&s;ent Object and a cu&s;tomary Tran&s;ition to the Idea of another Object, which we have been accu&s;tom'd to conjoin with the former? This is the whole Operation of the Mind in all our Conclu&s;ions concerning Matter of Fact and Exi&s;tence; and 'tis a Satisfaction to find &s;ome Analo|gies, by which it may be explain'd. The Tran&s;ition from a pre&s;ent Object does in all Ca&s;es give Strength and Solidity to the related Idea.</P>
<P>HERE is a kind of pre-e&s;tabli&s;h'd Harmony betwixt the Cour&s;e of Nature and the Succe&s;&s;ions of our Ideas; and tho' the Powers and Forces, by which the former is govern'd, be wholly unknown to us, yet our Thoughts and Conceptions have &s;till, we find, gone on in the &s;ame Train with the other Works of Nature. Cu&s;tom is that admirable Principle, by which this Corre&s;pon|dence has been effected; &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the Sub&s;i&s;t|ence of our Species, and the Regulation of our Con|duct, in every Circum&s;tance and Occurrence of hu|man Life. Had not the Pre&s;ence of an Object in|&s;tantly excited the Idea of tho&s;e Objects, commonly conjoin'd with it, all our Knowledge mu&s;t have been limited to the narrow Sphere of our Memory and Sen&s;es; and we &s;hould never have been able to adju&s;t Means to Ends, nor employ our natural Powers, ei|ther to the producing of Good, or avoiding of Evil.

<P>I SHALL add, as a farther Confirmation of the foregoing Theory, that as this Operation of the Mind, by which we infer like Effects from like Cau&s;es, and <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the Sub&s;i&s;tence of all hu|man Creatures, it is not probable it could be tru&s;ted to the fallacious Deductions of our Rea&s;on, which is &s;low in its Operations, appears not, in any Degree, during the fir&s;t Years of Infancy, and at be&s;t is, in every Age and Period of human Life, extremely liable to Error and Mi&s;take.

As Nature has taught us the U&s;e of our Limbs, without giving us the Knowledge of the Mu&s;cles and Nerves, by which they are actuated; &s;o has &s;he implanted in us an In|&s;tinct, that carries forward the Thought in a corre&s;|pondent Cour&s;e to that which &s;he has e&s;tabli&s;h'd a|mong external Objects; tho' we are ignorant of tho&s;e Powers and Forces, on which this regular Cour&s;e and Succe&s;&s;ion of Objects totally depends.</P>

<P>THO there be no &s;uch Thing as <HI>Chance</HI> in the World; our Ignorance of the real Cau&s;e of any Event has the &s;ame Influence on the Under&s;tand|ing, and begets a like Species of Belief or Opinion.</P>
<P>THERE is certainly a Probability, which ari&s;es from a Superiority of Chances on any Side; and according as this Superiority encrea&s;es, and &s;urpa&s;&s;es the oppo|&s;ite Chances, the Probability receives a proportionable Encrea&s;e, and begets &s;till a higher Degree of Belief or A&s;&s;ent to that Side, in which we di&s;cover the Superi|ority.
<PB N="94" REF="93">
If a Dye were mark'd with one Figure or Number of Spots on four Sides, and with another Fi|gure or Number of Spots on the two remaining Sides, 'twould be more probable, that the former &s;hould turn up than the latter; tho' if it had a thou&s;and Sides mark'd in the &s;ame Manner, and only one oppo&s;ite Side, the Probability would be much higher, and our Belief or Expectation of the Event more &s;teady and &s;ecure. This Proce&s;s of the Thought or Rea&s;oning may &s;eem trivial and obvious; but to tho&s;e, who con|&s;ider it more narrowly, it may, perhaps, afford Mat|ter for very curious Speculation.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems evident, that when the Mind looks for|ward to di&s;cover the Event, which may re&s;ult from the Throw of &s;uch a Dye, it con&s;iders the turning up of each particular Side as alike probable; and this is the very Nature of Chance to render all the particular Events, comprehended in it, entirely equal. But finding a greater Number of Sides concur in the one Event than in the other, the View is carry'd more frequently to that Event, and meets it oftner, in re|volving the various Po&s;&s;ibilities or Chances, on which the ultimate Re&s;ult depends. This Concurrence of the &s;everal Views in one particular Event begets im|mediately, by an inexplicable Contrivance of Nature, the Sentiment of Belief, and gives that Event the Ad|vantage over its Antagoni&s;t, which is &s;upported by a le&s;&s;er Number of Views, and recurs le&s;s frequently
<PB N="95" REF="94">
to the Mind. If we allow, that Belief is nothing but a firmer and &s;tronger Conception of an Object than what attends the mere Fictions of the Imagination, this Operation may, perhaps, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be ac|counted for. The Concurrence of the&s;e &s;everal Views or Glimp&s;es imprints its Idea more &s;trongly on the Imagination; gives it &s;uperior Force and Vigour; renders its Influence on the Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections more &s;en&s;ible; and in a word, begets that Reliance or Security, which con&s;titutes the Nature of Belief and Opinion.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;e is the &s;ame with the Probability of Cau&s;es as with that of Chance. There are &s;ome Cau&s;es, which are entirely uniform and con&s;tant in producing a particular Effect; and no In&s;tance has ever yet been found of any Failure or Irregularity in their Opera|tion. Fire has always burnt, and Water &s;uffocated every human Creature: The Production of Motion by Impul&s;e and Gravity is an univer&s;al Law, that has hi|therto admitted of no Exception. But there are other Cau&s;es which have been found more irregular and un|certain; nor has Rhubarb prov'd always a Purge, or Opium a Soporific to every one, who has taken the&s;e Medicines. 'Tis true; when any Cau&s;e fails of pro|ducing its u&s;ual Effect, Philo&s;ophers a&s;cribe not this to any Irregularity in Nature; but &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ome &s;ecret Cau&s;es, in the particular Structure of Parts,
<PB N="96" REF="95">
have prevented the Operation. Our Rea&s;onings, however, and Conclu&s;ions concerning the Event are the &s;ame as if this Principle had no Place. Being de|termin'd by Cu&s;tom to transfer the pa&s;t to the future, in all our Inferences; where the pa&s;t has been entirely regular and uniform, we expect the Event with the greate&s;t A&s;&s;urance, and leave no room for any con|trary Suppo&s;ition. But where different Effects have been &s;ound to follow from Cau&s;es, which are <HI>to Ap|pearance</HI> exactly &s;imilar, all the&s;e various Effects mu&s;t occur to the Mind in transferring the pa&s;t to the fu|ture, and enter into our Con&s;ideration, when we de|termine the Probability of the Event. Tho' we give the Preference to that which has been found mo&s;t u|&s;ual, and believe that this Effect will exi&s;t, we mu&s;t not overlook the other Effects, but mu&s;t give each of them a particular Weight and Authority, in Propor|tion as we have found it to be more or le&s;s frequent. 'Tis more probable, in every Place of <HI>Europe,</HI> that there will be Fro&s;t &s;ometime in <HI>January,</HI> than that the Weather will continue fre&s;h throughout that whole Month; tho' this Probability varies according to the different Climates, and approaches to a Certainty in the more northern Kingdoms. Here then it &s;eems evident that when we transfer the pa&s;t to the future, in order to determine the Effect that will re&s;ult from any Cau&s;e, we transfer all the different Events, in the &s;ame Proportion as they have appear'd in the pa&s;t, and conceive one to have exi&s;ted a hundred Times,
<PB N="97" REF="96">
for In&s;tance, another ten Times, and another once. As a great Number of Views do here concur in one Event, they fortify and confirm it to the Imagination, beget that Sentiment we call <HI>Belief,</HI> and give it the Preference above its Antagoni&s;t, which is not &s;up|ported by an equal Number of Experiments, and oc|curs not &s;o frequently to the Thought in transferring the pa&s;t to the future. Let any one try to account for this Operation of the Mind upon any of the receiv'd Sy&s;tems of Philo&s;ophy, and he will be &s;en&s;ible of the Difficulty. For my part, I &s;hall think it &s;ufficient, if the pre&s;ent Hints excite the Curio&s;ity of Philo&s;o|phers, and make them &s;en&s;ible how extremely defec|tive all receiv'd Theories are, in treating of &s;uch cu|rious and &s;uch &s;ublime Subjects.</P>

<P>THE great Advantage of the mathematical Sci|ences above the moral con&s;i&s;ts in this, that the Ideas of the former, being &s;en&s;ible, are always clear and determinate, the &s;malle&s;t Di&s;tinction betwixt them is immediately perceptible, and the &s;ame Terms are &s;till expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ame Ideas, without Ambiguity or Variation. An Oval is never mi&s;taken for a Cir|cle, nor an Hyperbola for an Ellip&s;is. The I&s;oceles and Scalenum are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by Boundaries more exact than Vice and Virtue, Right and Wrong. If any Term be defin'd in Geometry, the Mind readily, of it&s;elf, &s;ub&s;titutes, on all Occa&s;ions, the Definition for the Term defin'd: Or even when no Definition is
<PB N="100" REF="98">
employ'd, the Object it&s;elf may be pre&s;ented to the Sen&s;es, and by that Means be &s;teadily and clearly ap|prehended. But the finer Sentiments of the Mind, the Operations of the Under&s;tanding, the various Agi|tations of the Pa&s;&s;ions, tho' really in them&s;elves di&s;tinct, ea&s;ily e&s;cape us, when &s;urvey'd by Reflection; nor is it in our Power to recall the original Object, as often as we have occa&s;ion to contemplate it. Ambiguity, by this Means, is gradually introduc'd into our Rea|&s;onings: Similar Objects are readily taken to be the &s;ame: And the Conclu&s;ion becomes, at la&s;t, very wide of the Premi&s;es.</P>
<P>ONE may &s;afely, however, affirm, that if we con|&s;ider the&s;e Sciences in a proper Light, their Advantages and Di&s;advantages do very nearly compen&s;ate each o|ther, and reduce both of them to a State of Equality. If the Mind with greater Facility retains the Ideas of Ge|ometry clear and determinate, it mu&s;t carry on a much longer and more intricate Chain of Rea&s;oning, and com|pare Ideas much wider of each other, in order to reach the ab&s;tru&s;er Truths of that Science. And if more Ideas are apt, without extreme Care, to fall into Ob|&s;curity and Confu&s;ion, the Inferences are always much &s;horter in the&s;e Di&s;qui&s;itions, and the intermediate Steps, that lead to the Conclu&s;ion, much fewer th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> in the Sciences, which treat of Quantity and Number.

&s;imple as not to con&s;i&s;t of more Parts, than are to be found in any moral Rea&s;oning, which runs not into Chimera and Conceit. If we can trace the Principles of the human Mind thro' a few Steps, we may be very well &s;atisfy'd with our Progre&s;s; con&s;idering how &s;oon Nature throws a Bar to all our Enquiries concerning Cau&s;es, and reduces us to an Acknowledgment of our Ignorance. The chief Ob&s;tacle, therefore, to our Improvement in the moral or metaphy&s;ical Sciences is the Ob&s;curity of the Ideas, and Ambiguity of the Terms. The principal Difficulty in the Mathematics in the Length of Inferences and Compa&s;s of Thought, requi&s;ite to the forming any Conclu&s;ion. And per+haps, our Progre&s;s in natural Philo&s;ophy is mo&s;tly re|tarded by the Want of proper Experiments and Phe|nomena, which often are di&s;cover'd by Chance, and cannot always be found, when requi&s;ite, even by the mo&s;t diligent and prudent Enquiry. A moral Philo|&s;ophy &s;eems hitherto to have received le&s;s Improve|ments than either Geometry or Phy&s;ics, we may con|clude, that, if there be any Difference in this Re&s;pect among&s;t the&s;e Sciences, the Difficulties, which ob|&s;truct the Progre&s;s of the former, require the greate&s;t Care and Capacity to be &s;urmounted.</P>
<P>THERE are no Ideas, that occur in Metaphy&s;ics, more ob&s;cure and uncertain, than tho&s;e of <HI>Power, Force, E|nergy,</HI> or <HI>nece&s;&s;ary Connexion,</HI> which it is every Mo|ment

nece&s;&s;ary for us to treat of in all our Di&s;qui&s;itions. We &s;hall, therefore, endeavour, in this E&s;&s;ay, to fix, if po&s;&s;ible, the preci&s;e Meaning of the&s;e Terms, and thereby remove &s;ome Part of that Ob&s;curity, which is &s;o much complain'd of in this Species of Philo&s;o|phy.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems a Propo&s;ition, which will not admit of much Di&s;pute, that all our Ideas are nothing but Co|pies of our Impre&s;&s;ions, or in other Words, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for us to <HI>think</HI> of any Thing, which we have not antecedently <HI>felt,</HI> either by our external or internal Sen&s;es.

Complex Ideas may, perhaps, be well known by Definition, which is nothing but an Enumeration of tho&s;e Parts or &s;imple Ideas, that compo&s;e them. But when we have pu&s;h'd up Definitions to the mo&s;t &s;imple Ideas, and find &s;till &s;ome Ambiguity and Ob&s;curity; what Re|&s;ource are we then po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of?

View? Produce the Impre&s;&s;ions or original Sentiments, from which the Ideas are copy'd. The&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions are all &s;trong and &s;en&s;ible. They admit not of Ambiguity and Ob&s;curity. They are not only plac'd in a full Light them&s;elves, but may throw Light on their corre&s;pondent Ideas, which lie in Ob|&s;curity. And by this Means, we may, perhaps, at|tain a new Micro&s;cope or Species of Optics, by which, in the moral Sciences, the mo&s;t minute and mo&s;t &s;im|ple Ideas, may be &s;o enlarg'd as to fall readily under our Apprehen&s;ion, and be equally known with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Objects, that can be the Subjects of our Di&s;qui&s;ition and Enquiry.</P>
<P>To be fully acquainted, therefore, with the Idea of Power or nece&s;&s;ary Connexion, let us examine its Im|pre&s;&s;ion; and in order to find that with greater Certain|ty, let us &s;earch for all the Sources, from which it may po&s;&s;ibly be deriv'd.</P>

This Influence of the Will we know by Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.

The Operations and mutual Influence of Bodies are, perhaps, &s;ufficient to prove, that they al&s;o are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of it. However this may be, the Idea of Power mu&s;t certainly be al|low'd to be an Idea of Reflection, &s;ince it ari&s;es from reflecting on the Operations of our own Minds, and on the Command, which is exercis'd by Will over the Organs of the Body and Faculties of the Mind.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall proceed to examine this Preten&s;ion, and &s;hall endeavour to avoid, as far as we are able, all Jargon and Confu&s;ion, in treating of &s;uch &s;ubtile and &s;uch profound Subjects.</P>
<P>I ASSERT, then, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place, that the Influ|ence of Volition over the Organs of the Body, is a Fact, which, like all other natural Operations, could be known only by Experience, and could never be fore&s;een from any apparent Energy or Power in the Cau&s;e, which connects it with the Effect, and renders the one a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of the other. The Motions of our Body follow upon the Command of our Will. This we are every Moment con&s;cious of: But the Means, by which this is effected; the Ener|gy, by which the Will performs &s;o extraordinary an
<PB N="107" REF="105">
Operation; this we are &s;o far from being immediately con&s;cious of, that it mu&s;t for ever e&s;cape our mo&s;t di|ligent Search and Enquiry.</P>
<P>FOR <HI>fir&s;t</HI>; Is there any Principle in all Nature more my&s;terious than the Union of the Soul with the Body; by which a &s;uppos'd &s;piritual Sub&s;tance acquires &s;uch an Influence over a material one, that the mo&s;t refin'd Thought is able to actuate the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Body? Were we empower'd, by a &s;ecret Wi&s;h, to remove Moun|tains, or controul the Planets in their Orbits; this exten&s;ive Authority over Matter would not be more extraordinary, nor more beyond the Bounds of our Comprehen&s;ion. But if by Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s we per|ceiv'd any Power or Energy in the Will, we mu&s;t know this Power; we mu&s;t know its Connexion with the Effect; we mu&s;t know the &s;ecret Union of Soul and Body, and the Nature of both the&s;e Sub&s;tances; by which the one is able to operate, in &s;o many In|&s;tances, upon the other.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We are not able to move all the Organs of the Body with a like Authority; tho' we cannot a&s;|&s;ign any other Rea&s;on, be&s;ides Experience, for &s;o re|markable a Difference betwixt the one and the other. Why has the Will an Influence over the Tongue and Fingers, and not over the Heart or Liver? This Que|&s;tion would never embarra&s;s us, were we con&s;cious
<PB N="108" REF="106">
of a Power in the former Ca&s;e, and not in the latter. We &s;hould, then, perceive, independent of Expe|rience, why the Authority of Will over the Organs of the Body is circum&s;crib'd within &s;uch particular Li|mits. Being in that Ca&s;e fully acquainted with the Power or Force, by which it operates, we &s;hould al&s;o know, why its Influence reaches preci&s;ely to &s;uch Boundaries, and no farther.</P>
<P>A MAN, &s;truck &s;uddenly with a Pal&s;y in the Leg or Arm, or who had newly lo&s;t tho&s;e Members, fre|quently endeavours, at fir&s;t, to move them, and em|ploy them to their u&s;ual Offices. Here he is as much con&s;cious of Power to command &s;uch Limbs, as a Man in perfect Health is to actuate any Member, which remains in its natural State and Condition. But Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s never deceives. Con&s;equently, neither in the one Ca&s;e nor the other, are we ever con&s;cious of any Power. We only learn the Influence of our Will from Experience. And Experience only teaches us, how one Event con&s;tantly follows another, with|out in&s;tructing us in the &s;ecret Connexion, which binds them together, and renders them in&s;eparable.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> We learn from Anatomy, that the imme|diate Object of Power in voluntary Motion, is not the Member it&s;elf, which is mov'd, but certain Mu&s;cles, and Nerves, and animal Spirits, and perhaps, &s;ome|thing
<PB N="109" REF="107">
&s;till more minute and more unknown, thro' which the Motion is &s;ucce&s;&s;ively propagated, 'ere it reach the Member it&s;elf, who&s;e Motion is the imme|diate Object of Volition. Can there be a more certain Proof, that the Power, by which this whole Opera|tion is perform'd, &s;o far from being directly and fully known by an inward Sentiment or Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, is, to the la&s;t degree, my&s;terious and unintelligible? Here the Mind wills a certain Event: Immediately, another Event, unknown to our&s;elves, and totally different from that intended, is produc'd: This Event pro|duces another, equally unknown: Till at la&s;t, thro' a long Succe&s;&s;ion, the de&s;ir'd Event is produc'd. But if the original Power were felt, it mu&s;t be known: Were it known, its Effect mu&s;t al&s;o be known; &s;ince all Power is relative to its Effect. And <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> if the Effect be not known, the Power cannot be known or felt. How indeed can we be con&s;cious of a Power to move our Limbs, when we have no &s;uch Power; but only that to move certain animal Spirits, which, tho' they produce at la&s;t the Motion of our Limbs, yet operate in a Manner, that is altogether beyond our Comprehen&s;ion?</P>
<P>WE may, therefore, conclude from the whole, I hope, without any Temerity, tho' with A&s;&s;urance; that our Idea of Power is not copy'd from any Senti|ment

or Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Power within our&s;elves, when we give ri&s;e to animal Motion, or apply our Limbs to their proper U&s;e and Office. That their Motion follows the Command of the Will is a Matter of common Experience, like other natural Events: But the Power or Energy, by which this is effected, like that in other natural Events, is unknown and in|conceivable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be pretended, that the Re&s;i&s;tance, which we meet with in Bodies, obliging us frequently to exert our Force, and call up all our Power; this gives us the Idea of Force and Power.

<P>SHALL we then a&s;&s;ert, that we are con&s;cious of a Power or Energy in our own Minds, when, by an Act or Command of our Will, we rai&s;e up a new Idea, fix the Mind to a Contemplation of it, turn it on all

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It mu&s;t be allow'd, that when we know a Power, we know that very Circum&s;tance in the Cau&s;e, by which it is enabled to produce the Effect: For the&s;e are &s;uppos'd to be &s;ynonimous. We mu&s;t, there|fore, know both the Cau&s;e and Effect, and the Re|lation betwixt the one and the other. But do we pre|tend to be acquainted with the Nature of the human Soul and the Nature of an Idea, or the Aptitude of the one to produce the other? This is a real Creation; a Production of &s;omething out of nothing: Which implies a Power &s;o great, that it may &s;eem, at fir&s;t Sight, beyond the Reach of any Being, le&s;s than infi|nite. At lea&s;t, it mu&s;t be own'd, that &s;uch a Power is not felt, nor known, nor even conceivable by the Mind. We only feel the Event, <HI>viz.</HI> the Exi&s;tence of an Idea, con&s;equent to a Command of the Will: But the Manner, by which this Operation is per|&s;orm'd; the Power, by which it is produc'd; is en|tirely beyond our Comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Command of the Mind over it&s;elf is limited, as well as its Command over the Body; and
<PB N="112" REF="110">
the&s;e Limitations are not known by Rea&s;on, or any Contemplation of the Nature of the Cau&s;e and the Effect; but only by Experience and Ob&s;ervation, as in all other natural Events and in the Operation of external Objects. Our Authority over our Sentiments and Pa&s;&s;ions is much weaker than that over our I|deas; and even the latter Authority is circum&s;crib'd within very narrow Limits. Will any one pretend to a&s;&s;ign the ultimate Rea&s;on of the&s;e Limits, or &s;now why the Power is deficient in one Ca&s;e and not in an|other?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> This Self-command is very different at different Times. A Man in Health po&s;&s;effes more of it, than one langui&s;hing with Sickne&s;s. We are more Ma&s;ters of our Thoughts in the Morning than in the Evening: Fa&s;ting, than after a full Meal. Can we give any Rea&s;on for the&s;e Variations, except Expe|rience? Where then is the Power, of which we pre|tend to be con&s;cious? Is there not here &s;ome &s;ecret Mechani&s;m or Structure of Parts, either in a &s;piritual or material Sub&s;tance or both, upon which the Effect depends, and which being altogether unknown to us, renders the Power or Energy of the Will equally un|known and incomprehen&s;ible?</P>
<P>VOLITION is &s;urely an Act of the Mind, with which we are &s;ufficiently acquainted. Reflect upon it.
<PB N="113" REF="111">
Con&s;ider it on all Sides. Do you find any thing in it like this creative Power, by which it rai&s;es from no|thing a new Idea, and by a kind of FIAT, imitates the Omnipotence of its Maker, if I may be allow'd &s;o to &s;peak, who call'd forth into Exi&s;tence all the various Scenes of Nature? So far from being con&s;cious of this Energy in the Will, it requires as certain Expe|rience, as that which we are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of in the Ca&s;e, to convince us, that &s;uch extraordinary Effects do ever re&s;ult from a &s;imple Act of Volition.</P>
<P>THE Generality of Mankind never find any Diffi|culty in accounting for the more common and fa|miliar Operations of Nature; &s;uch as the De&s;cent of heavy Bodies, the Growth of Plants, the Generation of Animals, or the Nouri&s;hment of Bodies by Food; but &s;uppo&s;e, that, in all the&s;e Ca&s;es, they perceive the very Force and Energy of the Cau&s;e, by which it is connected with its Effect, and is for ever infallible in its Operation. They acquire, by long Habit, &s;uch a Turn of Mind, that, upon the Appearance of the Cau&s;e, they immediately expect with A&s;&s;urance its u|&s;ual Attendant, and hardly conceive it po&s;&s;ible, that any other Event could re&s;ult from it. 'Tis only on the Di&s;covery of extraordinary Phaenomena, &s;uch as Earthquakes, Pe&s;tilences, and Prodigies of any Kind, that they find them&s;elves at a Lo&s;s to a&s;&s;ign a proper Cau&s;e, and to explain the Manner, in which the Ef|fect
<PB N="114" REF="112">
is produc'd by it. 'Tis u&s;ual for Men, in &s;uch Difficulties, to have recour&s;e to &s;ome invi&s;ible, intel|ligent Principle, (<HI>qua&s;i Deus ex machina</HI>) as the im|mediate Cau&s;e of that Event, which &s;urpri&s;es them, and which, they think, cannot be accounted for from the common Powers of Nature. But Philo&s;ophers, who carry their Scrutiny a little farther, immediately perceive, that, even in the mo&s;t familiar Events, the Energy of the Cau&s;e is as unintelligible as in the mo&s;t extraordinary and unu&s;ual, and that we only learn by Experience the frequent CONJUNCTION of one Object with another, without being ever able to comprehend any thing like CONNEXION betwixt them. Here then many Philo&s;ophers think them&s;elves oblig'd by Rea&s;on to have recour&s;e, on all Occa&s;ions, to the &s;ame Prin|ciple, which the Vulgar never appeal to but in Ca&s;es, that appear miraculous and &s;upernatural. They ac|knowledge Mind and Intelligence to be, not only the ultimate and original Cau&s;e of all Things, but the im|mediate and &s;ole Cau&s;e of every Event, that appears in Nature. They pretend, that tho&s;e Objects, which are commonly denominated <HI>Cau&s;es,</HI> are in Reality no|thing but <HI>Occa&s;ions</HI>; and that the true and direct Prin|ciple of every Effect is not any Power or Force in Na|ture, but a Volition of the &s;upreme Being, who wills, that &s;uch particular Objects &s;hould be for ever conjoin'd with each other. In&s;tead of &s;aying, that one Billiard-Ball moves another, by a Force, which it has deriv'd
<PB N="115" REF="113">
from the Author of Nature; 'tis the Deity him&s;elf, they &s;ay, who, by a particular Volition, moves the &s;econd Ball, being determin'd to this Operation by the Impul&s;e of the fir&s;t Ball; in Con&s;equence of tho&s;e general Laws, which he has laid down to him&s;elf in the Government of the Univer&s;e. But Philo&s;ophers, advancing &s;till in their Enquiries, di&s;cover, that, as we are totally ignorant of the Power, on which de|pends the mutual Operation of Bodies, we are no le&s;s ignorant of that Power, on which depends the Operation of Mind on Body, or of Body on Mind; nor are we able, either from our Sen&s;es or Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, to a&s;&s;ign the ultimate Principle, in the one Ca&s;e more than in the other. The &s;ame Igno|rance, therefore, reduces them to the &s;ame Conclu|&s;ion. They a&s;&s;ert, that the Deity is the immediate Cau&s;e of the Union betwixt Soul and Body, and that they are not the Organs of Sen&s;e, which, being agi|tated by external Objects, produce Sen&s;ations in the Mind; but that 'tis a particular Volition of our om|nipotent Maker, which excites &s;uch a Sen&s;ation, in Con&s;equence of &s;uch a Motion in the Organ. In like manner, it is not any Energy in the Will, that pro|duces local Motion in our Members: 'Tis God him|&s;elf, who is pleas'd to &s;econd our Will, in it&s;elf impo|tent, and to command that Motion, which we erro|neou&s;ly attribute to our own Power and Efficacy. Nor do Philo&s;ophers &s;top at this Conclu&s;ion. They &s;ome|times
<PB N="116" REF="114">
apply the &s;ame Inferences to the Mind it&s;elf, in its internal Operations. Our mental Vi&s;ion or Con|ception of Ideas is nothing but a Revelation made to us by our Maker. When we voluntarily turn our Thoughts to any Object, and rai&s;e up its Image in the Fancy; it is not the Will, which creates that Idea: 'Tis the univer&s;al Creator of all Things, who di&s;co|vers it to the Mind, and renders it pre&s;ent to us.</P>
<P>THUS, according to the&s;e Philo&s;ophers, every Thing is full of God. Not contented with the Principle, that nothing exi&s;ts but by his Will, that nothing po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es any Power but by his Conce&s;&s;ion: They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Nature, and all created Beings of every Power, in or|der to render their Dependance on the Deity &s;till more &s;en&s;ible and immediate. They con&s;ider not, that by this Theory they dimini&s;h, in&s;tead of magnifying, the Grandeur of tho&s;e Attributes, which they affect &s;o much to celebrate. It argues &s;urely more Power in the Deity to delegate a certain Degree of Power to his inferior Creatures than to operate every Thing by his immediate Volition. It argues more Wi&s;dom to con|trive at fir&s;t the Fabric of the World with &s;uch perfect Fore&s;ight, that, of it&s;elf, and by its own proper Ope|ration, it may &s;erve all the Purpo&s;es of Providence, than if the great Creator were oblig'd every Moment to adju&s;t its Parts, and animate by his Breath all the Wheels of that &s;tupendous Machine.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="115">
BUT if we would have a more philo&s;ophical Con|futation of this Theory, perhaps the two following Reflections may &s;uffice.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It &s;eems to me, that this Theory, of the u|niver&s;al Energy and Operation of the &s;upreme Being, is too bold ever to carry Conviction with it to a Man, who is &s;ufficiently appriz'd of the Weakne&s;s of human Rea&s;on, and the narrow Limits, to which it is con|fin'd in all its Operations. Tho' the Chain of Argu|ments, that lead to it, were ever &s;o conclu&s;ive and lo|gical, there mu&s;t ari&s;e a &s;trong Supicion, if not an ab|&s;olute A&s;&s;urance, that it has led us quite beyond the Reach of our Faculties, when it e&s;tabli&s;hes Conclu|&s;ions &s;o extraordinary, and &s;o remote from common Life and Experience. We are got into Fairy-land, long ere we have reach'd the la&s;t Steps of our Theory; and <HI>there</HI> we have no Rea&s;on to tru&s;t our common Methods of Argument, or think that our u&s;ual Analo|gies and Probabilities have any Weight or Authority. Our Line is too &s;hort to fathom &s;uch immen&s;e Aby&s;&s;es. And however we may flatter our&s;elves, that we are guided in every Step we take by a kind of Veri&s;imili|tude and Experience; we may be a&s;&s;ur'd, that this fancy'd Experience has no Authority, when we thus apply it to Subjects, that lie entirely out of the Sphere
<PB N="118" REF="116">
of Experience. But on this we &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to touch afterwards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay XII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I cannot perceive any Force in the Ar|guments, on which this Theory is founded. We are ignorant, 'tis true, of the Manner, in which Bodies operate on each other: Their Force or Energy is en|tirely incomprehen&s;ible. But are we not equally ig|norant of the Manner or Force, by which a Mind, even the &s;upreme Mind, operates either on it&s;elf or on Body? Whence, I be&s;eech you, do we acquire any Idea of it? We have no Sentiment or Con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this Power in our&s;elves: We have no Idea of the &s;upreme Being, but what we learn from Reflection on our own Faculties. Were our Igno|rance, therefore, a good Rea&s;on for our rejecting any Thing, we &s;hould be led into that Principle of refu&s;ing all Energy to the &s;upreme Being as much as to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Matter. We &s;urely comprehend as little the Operations of the one as of the other. Is it more diffi|cult to conceive, that Motion may ari&s;e from Impul&s;e, than that it may ari&s;e from Volition? All we know is our profound Ignorance in both Ca&s;es<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I need not examine at length the <HI>vis inertioe,</HI> which is &s;o much talk'd of in the new Philo&s;ophy, and which is a&s;crib'd to Matter. We find by Experience, that a Body at Re&s;t or in Mo|tion continues for ever in its pre&s;ent State, till put from it by &s;ome new Cau&s;e: And that a Body impell'd takes as much Mo|tion from the impelling Body as it acquires it&s;elf. The&s;e are Facts. When we call this a <HI>vis inertiae,</HI> we only mark the&s;e Facts, without pretending to have any Idea of the inert Power; in the &s;ame Manner as when we talk of Gravity, we mean cer|tain Effects without comprehending that active Power. It was never the Meaning of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> to rob Matter of all Force or Energy; tho' &s;ome of his Followers have endeavour'd to e&s;ta|bli&s;h that Theory upon his Authority. On the contrary that great Philo&s;opher had recour&s;e to an etherial active Matter to ex|plain his univer&s;al Attraction; tho' he was &s;o cautious and mo|de&s;t as to allow, that it was a mere Hypothe&s;is, not to be in&s;i&s;ted on, without more Experiments. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that there is &s;ome|thing in the Fate of Opinions a little extraordinary. <HI>Des-Cartes</HI> in&s;inuated that Doctrine of the univer&s;al and &s;ole Efficacy of the Deity, without in&s;i&s;ting on it. <HI>Malebranche</HI> and other <HI>Carte&s;ians</HI> made it the Foundation of all their Philo&s;ophy. It had, however, no Authority in <HI>England. Locke, Clarke,</HI> and <HI>Cudworth,</HI> never &s;o much as take notice of it, but &s;uppo&s;e all along, that Matter has a real, tho' &s;ubordinate and deriv'd Power. By what Means has it become &s;o prevalent among our modern Metaphy&s;icians?</NOTE>.</P>

<P>BUT to ha&s;ten to a Conclu&s;ion of this Argument, which is already drawn out to too great a Length: We have &s;ought, in vain, for an Idea of Power or ne|ce&s;&s;ary Connexion in all the Sources, from which we could &s;uppo&s;e it to be deriv'd. It appears, that, in
<PB N="120" REF="118">
&s;ingle In&s;tances of the Operation of Bodies, we never can, by our outmo&s;t Scrutiny, di&s;cover any Thing but one Event following another, without being able to comprehend any Force or Power, by which the Cau&s;e operates, or any Connexion betwixt it and its &s;uppos'd Effect. The &s;ame Difficulty occurs in con|templating the Operations of Mind on Body; where we ob&s;erve the Motion of the latter to follow upon the Volition of the former; but are not able to ob&s;erve or conceive the Tye, which binds them together, or the Energy, by which the Mind produces this Effect. The Authority of the Will over our own Faculties and Ideas is not a whit more comprehen&s;ible: So that upon the whole, there appears not, thro' all Nature, any one In&s;tance of Connexion, that is conceivable by us: All Events &s;eem entirely loo&s;e and &s;eparate. One Event follows another; but we never can ob&s;erve any Tye betwixt them: They &s;eem <HI>conjoin'd,</HI> but never <HI>connected.</HI> And as we can have no Idea of any Thing, that never appear'd to our outward Sen&s;e or inward Sentiment, the nece&s;&s;ary Conclu&s;ion <HI>&s;eems</HI> to be, that we have no Idea of Connexion or Power at all, and that the&s;e Words are ab&s;olutely without any Meaning, when employ'd either in philo&s;ophical Rea&s;onings, or common Life.</P>
<P>BUT we have &s;till one Method of avoiding this Conclu&s;ion, and one Source, which we have not yet
<PB N="121" REF="119">
examin'd. When any natural Object or Event is pre|&s;ented, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for us, by any Sagacity or Pe|netration, to di&s;cover, or even conjecture, without Experience, what Event will re&s;ult from it, or to carry our Fore&s;ight beyond tho&s;e Objects, which are immediately pre&s;ent to the Memory and Sen&s;es. Even after one In&s;tance or Experiment, where we have ob&s;erv'd a particular Event to follow upon an|other, we are not entitled to form a general Rule, or foretel what will happen in like Ca&s;es; it being ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd an unpardonable Ra&s;hne&s;s and Temerity to judge of the whole Cour&s;e of Nature from one &s;ingle Experiment, however accurate or certain. But when one particular Species of Events has always, in all In|&s;tances, been conjoin'd with another, we make no longer any Scruple to foretell the one upon the Ap|pearance of the other, and to employ that Rea&s;oning, which can alone a&s;&s;ure us of any Matter of Fact or Exi&s;tence. We then call the one Object, <HI>Cau&s;e</HI>; and the other, <HI>Effect:</HI> We &s;uppo&s;e, that there is &s;ome Connexion betwixt them; &s;ome Power in the one, by which it infallibly produces the other, and operates with the greate&s;t Certainty and &s;tronge&s;t Ne|ce&s;&s;ity.</P>

IT appears, then, that this Idea of a nece&s;&s;ary Con|nexion among&s;t Objects or Events ari&s;es from a Num|ber of &s;imilar In&s;tances of the con&s;tant Conjunction of the&s;e Events, and can never be &s;ugge&s;ted by any one of the&s;e In&s;tances, &s;urvey'd in all po&s;&s;ible Lights and Po&s;itions. But what is there in a Number of In&s;tances, different from every &s;ingle In&s;tance, which is &s;uppos'd to be exactly &s;imilar? Nothing but this, that after a Repetition of &s;imilar In&s;tances, the Mind is carry'd by Habit, upon the Appearance of one Event, to expect its u&s;ual Attendant, and to believe, that it will exi&s;t. This Connexion, therefore, which we <HI>feel</HI> in the Mind, or cu&s;tomary Tran&s;ition of the Imagination from one Object to its u&s;ual Attendant, is the only Sentiment or Impre&s;&s;ion, from which we form the Idea of Power or nece&s;&s;ary Connexion. Nothing farther is in the Ca&s;e. Contemplate the Subject on all Sides, you will never find any other Origin of this Idea. There is no other Difference betwixt one In|&s;tance, from which we never can receive the Idea of Connexion, and a Number of &s;imilar In&s;tances, by which it is &s;ugge&s;ted. The fir&s;t Time a Man &s;aw the Communication of Motion by Impul&s;e, as by the Shock of two Billiard-balls, he could not pronounce that the one Effect was <HI>connected</HI>; but only that it was <HI>conjoin'd,</HI> with the other. After he has ob&s;erv'd &s;e|veral
<PB N="123" REF="121">
In&s;tances of this Nature, he then pronounces them to be <HI>connected.</HI> What Alteration has happen'd to give ri&s;e to this new Idea of <HI>Connexion?</HI> Nothing but this, that he now <HI>feels</HI> the&s;e Events to be <HI>connected</HI> in his Imagination, and can readily foretell the Ex|i&s;tence of the one from the Appearance of the other. When, therefore, we &s;ay, that one Object is connected with another, we mean only, that they have acquir'd a Connexion in our Thoughts, and give ri&s;e to this Inference, by which they become Proofs of each o|ther's Exi&s;tence. A Conclu&s;ion, which is &s;omewhat extraordinary; but which &s;eems founded on &s;ufficient Evidence. Nor will its Evidence be weakned by any general Diffidence of the Under&s;tanding, or &s;ceptical Su&s;picion concerning every Conclu&s;ion, that is new and extraordinary. No Conclu&s;ion can be more agreeable to Sceptici&s;m than &s;uch as make Di&s;coveries concern|ing the Weakne&s;s and narrow Limitations of human Rea&s;on and Capacity.</P>
<P>AND what &s;tronger In&s;tance can be produc'd of the &s;urprizing Ignorance and Weakne&s;s of the Under&s;tand|ing, than the pre&s;ent? For &s;urely, if there be any Relation among Objects, which it imports us to know perfectly, 'tis that of Cau&s;e and Effect. On this are founded all our Rea&s;onings concerning Matter of Fact

or Exi&s;tence. By Means of it alone we attain any A&s;&s;urance concerning Objects, that are remov'd from the pre&s;ent Te&s;timony of our Memory and Sen&s;es. The only immediate Utility of all Science is to teach us, how to controul and regulate future Events by their Cau&s;es. Our Thoughts and Enquiries are, there|fore, every Moment employ'd concerning this Re|lation. And yet &s;o imperfect are the Ideas we form concerning it, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to give any ju&s;t De|finition of Cau&s;e, except what is drawn from &s;ome|thing extraneous and foreign to it. Similar Objects are always conjoin'd with &s;imilar. Of this we have Experience. Suitable to this Experience, therefore, we may define a Cau&s;e to be <HI>an Object, follow'd by another, and where all the Objects, &s;imilar to the fir&s;t, are follow'd by Objects, &s;imilar to the &s;econd.</HI> The Ap|pearance of a Cau&s;e does always convey the Mind, by a cu&s;tomary Tran&s;ition, to the Idea of the Effect. Of this al&s;o we have Experience. We may, there|fore, &s;uitable to this Experience, form another Defi|nition of Cau&s;e, and call it, <HI>an Object, follow'd by an|other, and who&s;e Appearance always conveys the Thought to that other.</HI> But tho' both the&s;e Definitions be drawn from Circum&s;tances, foreign to the Cau&s;e, we cannot remedy this Inconvenience, or attain any more perfect Definition, which may point out that Circum&s;tance in the Cau&s;e, which gives it a Connexion with its Effect.
<PB N="125" REF="123">
We have no Idea of this Connexion; nor even any Notion what it is we de&s;ire to know, when we endea|vour at a Conception of it. We &s;ay, for In&s;tance, that the Vibration of this String is the Cau&s;e of this particular Sound. But what do we mean by that Af|firmation? We either mean, <HI>that this Vibration is fol|low'd by this Sound, and that all &s;imilar Vibrations have been follow'd by &s;imilar Sounds:</HI> Or, <HI>that this Vibra|tion is follow'd by this Sound, and that upon the Ap|pearance of the one, the Mind anticipates the Sen&s;es, and forms immediately an Idea of the other.</HI> We may con|&s;ider the Relation of Cau&s;e and Effect in either of the&s;e two Lights; but beyond the&s;e, we have no Idea of it.</P>
<P>To recapitulate, therefore, the Rea&s;onings of this E&s;&s;ay: Every Idea is copy'd from &s;ome preceding Im|pre&s;&s;ion or Sentiment; and where we cannot find any Impre&s;&s;ion, we may be certain there is no Idea. In all &s;ingle In&s;tances of the Operation of Bodies or Minds, there is nothing that produces any Impre&s;&s;ion, nor con&s;equently can &s;ugge&s;t any Idea of Power or nece&s;&s;ary Connexion. But when many uniform In|&s;tances appear, and the &s;ame Object is always follow'd by the &s;ame Event; we then begin to entertain the Notion of Cau&s;e and Connexion. We then <HI>feel</HI> a
<PB N="126" REF="124">
new Sentiment or Impre&s;&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> a cu&s;tomary Con|nexion in the Thought or Imagination betwixt one Object and its u&s;ual Attendant; and this Sentiment is the Original of that Idea we &s;eek for. For as this Idea ari&s;es from a Number of &s;imilar In&s;tances, and not from any &s;ingle In&s;tance; it mu&s;t ari&s;e from that Circum&s;tance, in which the Number of In&s;tances dif|fer from every individual In&s;tance. But this cu&s;to|mary Connexion or Tran&s;ition of the Imagination is the only Circum&s;tance, in which they differ. In every other particular, they are alike. The fir&s;t In|&s;tance we &s;aw of Motion, communicated by the Shock of two Billiard-balls (to return to this obvious In&s;tance) is exactly &s;imilar to any one, that may, at pre&s;ent, occur to us; except only, that we could not, at fir&s;t, <HI>infer</HI> the one Event from the other; which we are enabled to do at pre&s;ent, after &s;o long a Cour&s;e of uniform Experience. I know not, if the Reader will readily apprehend this Rea&s;oning. I am afraid, that, &s;hould I multiply Words about it, or throw it into a greater Variety of Lights, it would only become more ob&s;cure and intricate. In all ab&s;tract Rea|&s;onings, there is one Point of View, which, if we can happily hit, we &s;hall go farther towards il|lu&s;trating the Subject, than by all the Eloquence and copious Expre&s;&s;ion of the World.

<P>IT might rea&s;onably be expected, that, in Que|&s;tions, which have been canva&s;s'd and di&s;puted with great Eagerne&s;s &s;ince the fir&s;t Origin of Science and Philo&s;ophy, the Meaning of all the Terms, at lea&s;t, &s;hould have been agreed upon among the Di&s;|putants; and our Enquiries, in the Cour&s;e of two thou&s;and Years, been able to pa&s;s from Words to the true and real Subject of the Controver&s;y. For how ea&s;y may it &s;eem to give exact Definitions of the Terms employ'd in Rea&s;oning, and make the&s;e Defi|nitions, not the mere Sound of Words, the Object of future Scrutiny and Examination! But if we con&s;ider the Matter more narrowly, we &s;hall be apt to draw a quite oppo&s;ite Conclu&s;ion. From that Circum&s;tance alone, that a Controver&s;y has been long kept afoot,
<PB N="130" REF="127">
and remains &s;till undecided, we may pre&s;ume, that there is &s;ome Ambiguity in the Expre&s;&s;ion, and that the Di&s;putants affix different Ideas to the Terms em|ploy'd in the Controver&s;y. For as the Faculties of the Soul are &s;uppos'd to be naturally alike in all Men; otherwi&s;e nothing could be more fruitle&s;s than to rea&s;on or di&s;pute together; 'twere impo&s;&s;ible, if they affix'd the &s;ame Ideas to their Terms, they could &s;o long form different Opinions of the &s;ame Subject; e&s;pecially when they communicate their Views, and each Party turn them&s;elves on all Sides, in Search of Arguments, which may give them the Victory over their Antagoni&s;ts. 'Tis true; if they attempt the Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of Que&s;tions, that lie entirely beyond the Reach of human Capacity, &s;uch as tho&s;e concerning the Origin of Worlds, or the Oeconomy of the in|tellectual Sy&s;tem or Region of Spirits, they may long beat the Air in their fruitle&s;s Conte&s;ts, and never ar|rive at any determinate Conclu&s;ion. But if the Que|&s;tion regard any Subject of common Life and Expe|rience; nothing, one would think, could pre&s;erve the Di&s;pute &s;o long undecided, but &s;ome ambiguous Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, which keep the Antagoni&s;ts &s;till at a Di|&s;tance, and hinder them from grappling with each other.</P>
<P>THIS has been the Ca&s;e in the long-di&s;puted Que|&s;tion concerning Liberty and Nece&s;&s;ity; and to &s;o re|markable
<PB N="131" REF="128">
a Degree, that, If I be not much mi&s;taken, we &s;hall find all Mankind, both learned and ignorant, to have been always of the &s;ame Opinion with regard to that Subject, and that a few intelligible Definitions would immediately have put an end to the whole Con|trover&s;y. I own, that this Di&s;pute has been &s;o much canva&s;s'd on all hands, and has led Philo&s;ophers into &s;uch a Labyrinth of ob&s;cure Sophy&s;try, that 'tis no Wonder, if a &s;en&s;ible and polite Reader indulge his Ea&s;e &s;o far as to turn a deaf Ear to the Propo&s;al of &s;uch a Que&s;tion, from which he can expect neither In&s;truction nor Entertainment. But the State of the Argument here propo&s;ed may, perhaps, &s;erve to re|new his Attention, as it has more Novelty, promi&s;es, at lea&s;t, &s;ome Deci&s;ion of the Controver&s;y, and will not much di&s;turb his Ea&s;e, by any intricate or ob&s;cure Rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>I HOPE, therefore, to make appear, that all Men have ever agreed in the Doctrines both of Nece&s;&s;ity, and of Liberty, according to any rea&s;onable Sen&s;e, that can be put on the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions; and that the whole Controver&s;y has hitherto turn'd merely upon Words. We &s;hall begin with examining the Doctrine of Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>'Tis univer&s;ally allow'd, that Matter, in all its Operations, is actuated by a nece&s;&s;ary Force, and that
<PB N="132" REF="129">
every Effect is &s;o preci&s;ely determin'd by the Nature and Energy of its Cau&s;e, that no other Effect, in &s;uch particular Circum&s;tances, could po&s;&s;ibly have re&s;ulted from the Operation of that Cau&s;e. The Degree and Direction of every Motion is, by the Laws of Nature, pre&s;crib'd with &s;uch Exactne&s;s, that a living Creature may as &s;oon ari&s;e from the Shock of two Bodies, as Motion in any other Degree or Direction, than what is actually produc'd by it. Would we, therefore, form a ju&s;t and preci&s;e Idea of <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> we mu&s;t con|&s;ider, whence that Idea ari&s;es, when we apply it to the Operation of Bodies.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems evident, that, if all the Scenes of Nature were &s;hifted continually in &s;uch a Manner, that no two Events bore any Re&s;emblance to each other, but every Object was entirely new, without any Similitude to whatever had been &s;een before, we &s;hould never, in that Ca&s;e, have attain'd the lea&s;t Idea of Nece&s;&s;ity, or of a Connexion among&s;t the&s;e Objects. We might &s;ay, upon &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition, that one Object or E|vent has follow'd another; not that one was produc'd by the other. The Relation of Cau&s;e and Effect mu&s;t be utterly unknown to Mankind. Inference and Rea|&s;oning concerning the Operations of Nature would, from that Moment, be at an End; and the Memory and Sen&s;es remain the only Canals, by which the Knowledge of any real Exi&s;tence could po&s;&s;ibly have acce&s;s to the Mind. Our Idea, therefore, of Nece&s;|&s;ity
<PB N="133" REF="130">
and Cau&s;ation ari&s;es entirely from that Unifor|mity, ob&s;ervable in the Operations of Nature; where &s;imilar Objects are con&s;tantly conjoin'd together, and the Mind is determin'd by Cu&s;tom to infer the one from the Appearance of the other. The&s;e two Cir|cum&s;tances form the whole of that Nece&s;&s;ity, which we a&s;cribe to Matter. Beyond the con&s;tant <HI>Conjunc|tion</HI> of &s;imilar Objects, and the con&s;equent <HI>Inference</HI> from one to the other, we have no Notion of any Ne|ce&s;&s;ity or Connexion.</P>
<P>IF it appear, therefore, that all Mankind have ever allow'd, without any Doubt or He&s;itation, that the&s;e two Circum&s;tances, take place in the voluntary Actions of Men, and in the Operations of the Mind; it mu&s;t follow, that all Mankind have ever agreed in the Doctrine of Nece&s;&s;ity, and that they have hitherto di&s;puted, merely for Want of under&s;tanding each other.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t Circum&s;tance, the con&s;tant and regu|lar Conjunction of &s;imilar Events; we may po&s;&s;ibly &s;atisfy our&s;elves by the following Con&s;iderations. It is univer&s;ally acknowledg'd, that there is a great Uniformity among&s;t the Actions of Men, in all Na|tions and Ages, and that human Nature remains &s;till the &s;ame, in its Principles and Operations. The &s;ame Motives produce always the &s;ame Actions: The &s;ame
<PB N="134" REF="131">
Events follow from the &s;ame Cau&s;es. Ambition, Avarice, Self-love, Vanity, Friend&s;hip, Genero&s;ity, public Spirit; the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, mix'd in various De|grees, and di&s;tributed thro' Society, have been, from the Beginning of the World, and &s;till are, the Sources of all the Actions and Enterprizes, that have ever been ob&s;erv'd among&s;t Mankind. Would you know the Sentiments, Inclinations, and Cour&s;e of Life of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans?</HI> Study well the Temper and Actions of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> You cannot be much mi&s;taken in transferring to the former <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of the Ob&s;ervations you have made with regard to the latter. Mankind are &s;o much the &s;ame, in all Times and Places, that Hi&s;tory informs us of nothing new or &s;trange in this particular. Its chief U&s;e is only to di&s;|cover the con&s;tant and univer&s;al Principles of human Nature, by &s;hewing Men in all Varieties of Circum|&s;tances and Situations, and furni&s;hing us with Mate|rials, from which we may form our Ob&s;ervations, and become acquainted with the regular Springs of human Action and Behaviour. The&s;e Records of Wars, In|trigues, Factions, and Revolutions are &s;o many Col|lections of Experiments, by which the Politician or moral Philo&s;opher fixes the Principles of his Science; in the &s;ame Manner as the Phy&s;ician or natural Phi|lo&s;opher becomes acquainted with the Nature of Plants, Minerals, and other external Objects, by the Experiments, which he forms concerning them. Nor are the Earth, Water, and other Elements, examin'd
<PB N="135" REF="132">
by <HI>Ari&s;tctle,</HI> and <HI>Hypocrates,</HI> more like tho&s;e, which at pre&s;ent lie under our Ob&s;ervation, than the Men, de&s;crib'd by <HI>Polybius</HI> and <HI>Tacitus,</HI> are to tho&s;e who now govern the World.</P>
<P>SHOULD a Traveller, returning from a far Coun|try, bring us an Account of Men, entirely different from any we were ever acquainted with; Men, who were entirely dive&s;ted of Avarice, Ambition, or Re|venge; who knew no Plea&s;ure but Friend&s;hip, Gene|ro&s;ity, and public Spirit; we &s;hould immediately, from the&s;e Circum&s;tances, detect the Fal&s;hood, and prove him a Liar, with the &s;ame Certainty as if he had &s;tuff'd his Narration with Stories of Centaurs and Dragons, Miracles and Prodigies. And if we would explode any Forgery in Hi&s;tory, we cannot make u&s;e of a more convincing Argument, than to prove, that the Actions, a&s;crib'd to any Per&s;on, are directly con|trary to the Cour&s;e of Nature, and that no human Motives, in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, could ever induce him to &s;uch a Conduct. The Veracity of <HI>Quintus Curtius</HI> is as &s;u&s;picious, when he de&s;cribes the &s;uper|natural Courage of <HI>Alexander,</HI> by which he was hur|ry'd on &s;ingly to attack Multitudes, as when he de|&s;cribes his &s;upernatural Force and Activity, by which he was able to re&s;i&s;t them. So readily and univer&s;ally do we acknowledge a Uniformity in human Motives and Actions as well as in the Operations of Body.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="133">
HENCE likewi&s;e the Benefit of that Experience, acquir'd by a long Life and a Variety of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Company, in order to in&s;truct us in the Principles of human Nature, and regulate our future Conduct, as well as Speculation. By Means of this Guide, we mount up to the Knowledge of Mens Inclinations and Motives, from their Actions, Expre&s;&s;ions, and even Ge&s;tures; and again, de&s;cend to the Interpreta|tion of their Actions from the Knowledge of their Motives and Inclinations. The general Ob&s;ervations, trea&s;ur'd up by a Cour&s;e of Practice and Experience, give us the Clue of human Nature, and teach us to unravel all its Labyrinths and Intricacies. Pretexts and Appearances no longer deceive us. Public De|clarations pa&s;s for the &s;pecious Colouring of a Cau&s;e: And tho' Virtue and Honour be allow'd their proper Weight and Authority, that perfect Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, &s;o often pretended, is never expected in Multitudes and Parties; &s;eldom in their Leaders; and &s;carcely even in Individuals of any Rank or Station. But were there no Uniformity in human Actions, and were every Experiment we could form of this Kind irregular and anomolous, 'twere impo&s;&s;ible to collect any general Ob&s;ervations concerning Mankind; and no Experience, however accurately dige&s;ted by Re|flection, would ever &s;erve to any Purpo&s;e. Why is the antient Hu&s;bandman more &s;kilful in his Calling than the young Beginner, but becau&s;e there is a cer|tain

Uniformity in the Operation of the Sun, Rain, and Earth, towards the Production of Vegetables; and Experience teaches the old Practitioner the Rules, by which this Operation is govern'd and directed?</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t not, however, expect, that this Unifor|mity of human Actions &s;hould be carry'd &s;uch a Length, as that all Men, in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances, &s;hould always act preci&s;ely in the &s;ame Manner, with|out any Allowance for the Diver&s;ity of Characters, Prejudices, and Opinions. Such a Uniformity, in every Particular, is found in no Part of Nature.

<P>ARE the Manners of Men different in different Ages and Countries? We learn thence the great Force of Cu&s;tom and Education, which mold the human Mind from its Infancy, and form it into a fix'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd Character. Is the Behaviour and Conduct of the one Sex very unlike that of the other? 'Tis from thence we become acquainted with the different Characters, which Nature has impre&s;s'd upon the Sexes, and which &s;he pre&s;erves with Con&s;tancy and Regularity. Are the Actions of the &s;ame Per&s;on much diver&s;ify'd in the different Periods of his Life, from Infancy to old
<PB N="138" REF="135">
Age? This affords Room for many general Ob&s;erva|tions concerning the gradual Change of our Senti|ments and Inclinations, and the different Maxims, which prevail in the different Ages of human Crea|tures. Even the Characters which are peculiar to each Individual, have a Con&s;tancy and Uniformity in their Influence, otherwi&s;e our Acquaintance with the Per&s;ons, and our Ob&s;ervations of their Conduct could never teach us their Di&s;po&s;itions, nor &s;erve to direct our Behaviour with regard to them.</P>
<P>I GRANT it po&s;&s;ible to find &s;ome Actions, which &s;eem to have no regular or uniform Connexion with any known Motives, and are Exceptions to all the Mea&s;ures of Conduct, which have ever been e&s;tabli&s;h'd for the Government of Men. But if we would wil|lingly know, what Judgment &s;hould be form'd of &s;uch irregular and extraordinary Actions; we may con&s;ider the Sentiments that are commonly enter|tain'd with regard to tho&s;e irregular Events, which appear in the Cour&s;e of Nature, and the Operations of external Objects. All Cau&s;es are not conjoin'd to their u&s;ual Effects, with like Con&s;tancy and Unifor|mity. An Artificer, who handles only dead Matter, may be di&s;appointed of his Scope and Aim as well as the Politician, who directs the Conduct of &s;en&s;ible and intelligent Agents.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="136">
THE Vulgar, who take Things according to their fir&s;t Appearance, attribute the Uncertainty of Events to &s;uch an Uncertainty in the Cau&s;es as makes them often fail of their u&s;ual Influence; tho' they meet with no Ob&s;tacle nor Impediment in their Operation. But Philo&s;ophers, ob&s;erving, that almo&s;t in every Part of Nature there is contain'd a va&s;t Variety of Springs and Principles, which are hid, by rea&s;on of their Mi|nutene&s;s or Remotene&s;s, find, that 'tis at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible the Contrariety of Events may not proceed from any Contingency in the Cau&s;e, but from the &s;ecret Ope|ration of contrary Cau&s;es. This Po&s;&s;ibility is con|verted into Certainty by farther Ob&s;ervation, when they remark, that, upon an exact Scrutiny, a Con|trariety of Effects always betrays a Contrariety of Cau&s;es, and proceeds from their mutual Hindrance and Oppo&s;ition. A Pea&s;ant can give no better Rea|&s;on for the &s;topping of any Clock or Watch than to &s;ay it commonly does not go right: But an Artizan ea&s;ily perceives, that the &s;ame Force in the Spring or Pendulum has always the &s;ame Influence on the Wheels; but fails of its u&s;ual Effect, perhaps by Rea|&s;on of a Grain of Du&s;t, which puts a &s;top to the whole Movement. From the Ob&s;ervation of &s;everal parallel In&s;tances, Philo&s;ophers form a Maxim, that the Con|nexion betwixt all Cau&s;es and Effects is equally nece&s;|&s;ary, and that its &s;eeming Uncertainty in &s;ome In|&s;tances
<PB N="140" REF="137">
proceeds from the &s;ecret Oppo&s;ition of con|trary Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>THUS for In&s;tance, in the human Body, when the u&s;ual Symptoms of Health or Sickne&s;s di&s;appoint our Expectations; when Medicines operate not with their wonted Powers; when irregular Events follow from any particular Cau&s;es; the Philo&s;opher and Phy&s;ician are not &s;urpriz'd at the Matter, nor are ever tempted to deny, in general, the Nece&s;&s;ity and Uniformity of tho&s;e Principles, by which the animal Ceconomy is conducted. They know, that a human Body is a mighty complicated Machine: That many &s;ecret Powers lurk in it, which are altogether beyond our Comprehen&s;ion: That to us it mu&s;t often appear very uncertain in its Operations: And that therefore the irregular Events, which outwardly di&s;cover them|&s;elves, can be no Proof, that the Laws of Nature are not ob&s;erv'd with the greate&s;t Strictne&s;s and Regula|rity in its internal Operations and Government.</P>
<P>THE Philo&s;opher, if he be con&s;i&s;tent, mu&s;t apply the &s;ame Rea&s;onings to the Actions and Volitions of intelligent Agents. The mo&s;t irregular and unex|pected Re&s;olutions of Men may frequently be ac|counted for by tho&s;e who know every particular Cir|cum&s;tance of their Character and Situation. A Per&s;on of an obliging Di&s;po&s;ition gives a peevi&s;h An&s;wer:

But he has the Tooth-ake, or has not din'd. A &s;tu|pid Fellow di&s;covers an uncommon Alacrity in his Carriage: But he has met with a &s;udden Piece of Good-fortune. Or even when an Action, as &s;ome|times happens, cannot be particularly accounted for, either by the Per&s;on him&s;elf or by others; we know, in general, that the Characters of Men are, to a cer|tain Degree, incon&s;tant and irregular. This is, in a Manner, the con&s;tant Character of human Nature; tho' it be applicable, in a more particular Manner, to &s;ome Per&s;ons, who have no fix'd Rule for their Con|duct, but proceed in a continu'd Cour&s;e of Caprice and Incon&s;tancy. The internal Principles and Mo|tives may operate in a uniform Manner, notwith&s;tand|ing the&s;e &s;eeming Irregularities; in the &s;ame Manner as the Winds, Rain, Clouds, and other Variations of the Weather are &s;uppos'd to be govern'd by &s;teady Principles; tho' not ea&s;ily di&s;coverable by human Sa|gacity and Enquiry.</P>
<P>THUS it appears, not only that the Conjunction betwixt Motives and voluntary Actions is as regular and uniform, as that betwixt the Cau&s;e and Effect in any Part of Nature; but al&s;o that this regular Con|junction has been univer&s;ally acknowledg'd among&s;t Mankind, and has never been the Subject of Di&s;pute, either in Philo&s;ophy or common Life. Now as it is from pa&s;t Experience, that we draw all Inferences
<PB N="142" REF="139">
concerning the future, and as we conclude, that Ob|jects will always be conjoin'd together, which we find always to have been conjoin'd; it may &s;eem &s;uper|fluous to prove, that this experienc'd Uniformity in human Actions is the Source of all the <HI>In&s;erences</HI> we form concerning them. But in order to throw the Argument into a greater Variety of Lights, we &s;hall al&s;o in&s;i&s;t, tho' briefly, on this latter Topic.</P>
<P>THE mutual Dependance of Men is &s;o great, in all Societies, that &s;carce any human Action is en|tirely compleat in it&s;elf, or is perform'd without &s;ome Reference to the Actions of others, which are requi|&s;ite to make it an&s;wer fully the Intention of the Actor. The poore&s;t Artificer, who labours alone, expects at lea&s;t the Protection of the Magi&s;trate, to en&s;ure the Enjoyment of the Fruits of his Labour. He al&s;o ex|pects, that, when he carries his Goods to Market, and offers them at a rea&s;onable Price, he &s;hall find Buyers; and &s;hall be able, by the Money he acquires, to en|gage others to &s;upply him with tho&s;e Commodities, which are requi&s;ite for his Sub&s;i&s;tence. In Propor|tion as Mens Dealings are more exten&s;ive, and their Intercour&s;e with others more complicated, they al|ways comprehend, in their Schemes of Life, a greater Variety of voluntary Actions, which they expect, from their proper Motives, to co-operate with their own. In all the&s;e Conclu&s;ions, they take their Mea|&s;ures
<PB N="143" REF="140">
from pa&s;t Experience, in the &s;ame Manner as in their Rea&s;onings concerning external Objects; and firmly believe, that Men, as well as all the Elements, are to continue, in their Operations, the &s;ame, which they have ever found them. A Manufacturere reckons upon the Labour of his Servants, for the Execution of any Work, as much as upon the Tools he employs, and would be equally &s;urpriz'd, in the one Ca&s;e, were his Expectations di&s;appointed, as in the other. In &s;hort, this experimental Inference and Rea&s;oning con|cerning the Actions of others enters &s;o much into hu|man Life, that no Man, while awake, is ever a Mo|ment without employing it. Have we not Rea&s;on, therefore, to affirm, that all Mankind have always agreed in the Doctrine of Nece&s;&s;ity, according to the foregoing Definition and Explication of it?</P>
<P>NOR have Philo&s;ophers ever entertain'd a different Opinion from the People in this Particular. For not to mention, that almo&s;t every Action of their Life &s;uppo&s;es it; there are even few of the &s;peculative Parts of Learning, to which it is not e&s;&s;ential. What would become of <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> had we not a Dependance on the Veracity of the Hi&s;torian, according to the Ex|perience we have had of Mankind? How could <HI>Poli|tics</HI> be a Science, if Laws and Forms of Government had not a uniform and regular Influence upon Society? Where would be the Foundation of <HI>Morals,</HI> if par|ticular
<PB N="144" REF="141">
Characters had no certain nor determinate Power to produce particular Sentiments, and if the&s;e Sentiments had no con&s;tant Operation on Actions? And with what Pretext could we employ our <HI>Critici&s;m</HI> upon any Poet or polite Author, if we could not pro|nounce the Conduct and Sentiments of his Actors, ei|ther natural or unnatural, to &s;uch Characters, and in &s;uch Circum&s;tances? It &s;eems almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, there|fore, to engage, either in Science or Action of any Kind, without acknowledging the Doctrine of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, and this <HI>Inference</HI> from Motives to voluntary Actions; from Characters to Conduct.</P>
<P>AND indeed, when we con&s;ider how aptly <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> Evidence link together, and form only one Chain of Argument betwixt them, we &s;hall make no Scruple to allow, that they are of the &s;ame Nature, and deriv'd from the &s;ame Principles. A Pri&s;oner, who has neither Money nor Intere&s;t, di&s;covers the Impo&s;&s;ibility of his E&s;cape, as well from the Ob&s;ti|nacy of the Goaler, as from the Walls and Bars, with which he is &s;urrounded; and in all Attempts for his Freedom, chu&s;es rather to work upon the Stone and Iron of the one, than upon the inflexible Nature of the other. The &s;ame Pri&s;oner, when conducted to the Scaffold, fore&s;ees his Death as certainly from the Con&s;tancy and Fidelity of his Guards as from the Ope|ration
<PB N="145" REF="142">
of the Ax or Wheel. His Mind runs along a certain Train of Ideas: The Refu&s;al of the Soldiers to con&s;ent to his E&s;cape; the Action of the Execu|tioner; the Separation of the Head and Body; Bleed|ing, convul&s;ive Motions, and Death. Here is a con|nected Chain of natural Cau&s;es and voluntary Actions; but the Mind feels no Difference betwixt them, in pa&s;&s;ing from one Link to another: nor is le&s;s certain of the future Event than if it were connected with the Objects pre&s;ent to the Memory or Sen&s;es, by a Train of Cau&s;es, cemented together by what we are pleas'd to call a <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> Nece&s;&s;ity. The &s;ame experienc'd Union has the fame Effect on the Mind, whether the united Objects be Motives, Volitions, and Actions; or Figure and Motion. We may change the Names of Things; but their Nature and their Operation on the Under&s;tanding never change.</P>
<P>I HAVE frequently con&s;ider'd, what could po&s;&s;ibly be the Rea&s;on, why all Mankind, tho' they have ever, without He&s;itation, acknowledged the Doctrine of Nece&s;&s;ity, in their whole Practice and Rea&s;oning, have yet di&s;cover'd &s;uch a Reluctance to acknowledge it in Words, and have rather &s;hewn a Propen&s;ity, in all Ages, to profe&s;s the contrary Opinion. The Matter, I think, may be accounted for, after the following Manner. If we examine the Operations of Bodies and the Production of Effects from their Cau&s;es,
<PB N="146" REF="143">
we &s;hall find, that all our Faculties can never carry us farther in our Knowledge of this Relation, than barely to ob&s;erve, that particular Objects are <HI>con&s;tantly conjoin'd</HI> together, and that the Mind is carry'd, by a <HI>cu&s;tomary Tran&s;ition,</HI> from the Appearance of the one to the Belief of the other. But tho' this Conclu&s;ion concerning human Ignorance be the Re&s;ult of the &s;tricte&s;t Scrutiny and Examination of this Subject, Men &s;till entertain a &s;trong Propen&s;ity to believe, that they penetrate farther into the Powers of Nature, and perceive &s;omething like a nece&s;&s;ary Connexion betwixt the Cau&s;e and the Effect. When again they turn their Reflections towards the Operations of their own Minds, and <HI>feel</HI> no &s;uch Connexion of the Mo|tive and the Action; they are apt, from thence, to &s;uppo&s;e, that there is a Difference betwixt the Effects, re&s;ulting from material and brute Force, and tho&s;e which ari&s;e from Thought and Intelligence. But be|ing once convinc'd, that we know nothing farther of Cau&s;ation of any Kind, than merely the <HI>con&s;tant Con|junction</HI> of Objects, and the con&s;equent <HI>Inference</HI> of the Mind from one to another, and finding, that the&s;e two Circum&s;tances are univer&s;ally acknowledged to have place in voluntary Actions; we may thence be more ea&s;ily led to own the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity, common to all Cau&s;es. And tho' this Rea&s;oning may contradict the Sy&s;tems of many Philo&s;ophers, in a&s;cribing Nece&s;&s;ity to the Determinations of the Will, we &s;hall find, upon Reflection, that they di&s;&s;ent from it in Words only,
<PB N="147" REF="144">
not in their real Sentiments. Nece&s;&s;ity, according to the Sen&s;e in which it is here taken, has never yet been rejected, nor can ever, I think, be rejected, by any Philo&s;opher. It may only, perhaps, be pretend|ed, that the Mind can perceive, in the Operations of Matter, &s;ome farther Connexion betwixt the Cau&s;e and Effect; and a Connexion, which has not Place in the voluntary Actions of intelligent Beings. Now whether it be &s;o or not, can only appear upon Exami|nation, and it is incumbent on the&s;e Philo&s;ophers to make good their A&s;&s;ertion, by defining or de&s;cribing that Nece&s;&s;ity, and pointing it out to us, in the Ope|rations of material Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>IT would &s;eem, indeed, that Men begin at the wrong End of this Que&s;tion concerning Liberty and Nece&s;&s;ity, when they enter upon it by examining the Faculties of the Soul, the Influence of the Under|&s;tanding, and the Operations of the Will. Let them fir&s;t di&s;cu&s;s a more &s;imple Que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> the Opera|tions of Body and of brute unintelligent Matter; and try if they can there form any Idea of Cau&s;ation and Nece&s;&s;ity, except that of a con&s;tant Conjunction of Objects, and &s;ub&s;equent Inference of the Mind from one to another. If the&s;e Circum&s;tances form, in re|ality, the whole of that Nece&s;&s;ity, which we can con|ceive in Matter, and if the&s;e Circum&s;tances be al&s;o univer&s;ally acknowledg'd to take place in the Opera|tions of the Mind, the Di&s;pute is at an End; or, at lea&s;t,
<PB N="148" REF="145">
mu&s;t be own'd to be thenceforward merely verbal. But as long as we will ra&s;hly &s;uppo&s;e, that we have &s;ome farther Idea of Nece&s;&s;ity and Cau&s;ation in the Operations of external Objects; at the &s;ame time, that we can find nothing farther, in the volun|tary Actions of the Mind; there is no Po&s;&s;ibility of bringing the Di&s;pute to any determinate I&s;&s;ue, while we proceed upon &s;o erroneous a Suppo&s;ition. The only Method of undeceiving us, is, to mount up higher; to examine the narrow Extent of our Know|ledge, when apply'd to material Cau&s;es; and to con|vince our&s;elves, that all we know of them, is, the con&s;tant Conjunction and Inference above-mention'd. We may, perhaps, find, that 'tis with Difficulty we are induc'd to fix &s;uch narrow Limits to human Un|der&s;tanding: But we can afterwards find no Difficulty, when we come to apply this Doctrine to the Actions of the Will. For as 'tis evident, that the&s;e have a regu|lar and con&s;tant Conjunction with Motives and Cir|cum&s;tances and Characters, and as we always draw Inferences from the one to the other, we mu&s;t be oblig'd to acknowledge, in Words, that Nece&s;&s;ity, which we have already avow'd, in every Deliberation and Reflection of our Lives, and in every Step of our Conduct and Behaviour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Prevalence of the Doctrine of Liberty may be accounted for, from another Cau&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> a fal&s;e Sen&s;ation or &s;eeming Ex|perience which we have, or may have of Liberty or Indifference, in many of our Actions. The Nece&s;&s;ity of any Action, whether of Matter or of Mind, is not, properly &s;peaking, a Quality in the Agent, but in any thinking or intelligent Being, who may con|&s;ider the Action; and it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the Determination of his Thought to infer the Exi&s;tence of that Action from &s;ome pre|ceding Objects, as Liberty, when oppos'd to Nece&s;&s;ity, is no|thing but the Want of that Determination, and a certain Loo&s;e|ne&s;s or Indifference, which we feel, in pa&s;&s;ing or not pa&s;&s;ing, from the Idea of one Object to that of any &s;ucceeding one. Now we may ob&s;erve, that, tho' in <HI>reflecting</HI> on human Actions we &s;eldom feel &s;uch a Loo&s;ene&s;s or Indifference, but are commonly able to infer them with con&s;iderable Certainty from their Mo|tives, and from the Di&s;po&s;itions of the Agent; yet it frequently happens, that, in <HI>performing</HI> the Actions them&s;elves, we are &s;en|&s;ible of &s;omething like it: And as all re&s;embling Objects are rea|dily taken for each other, this has been employ'd as a demon|&s;trative and even an intuitive Proof of human Liberty. We feel, that our Actions are &s;ubject to our Will, on mo&s;t Occa&s;ions; and imagine we feel, that the Will it&s;elf is &s;ubject to nothing, becau&s;e, when by a Denial of it we are provok'd to try, we feel that it moves ea&s;ily every Way, and produces an Image of it&s;elf, (or a <HI>Velle&iuml;ty,</HI> as it is call'd in the Schools) even on that Side, on which it did not &s;ettle. This Image, or faint Motion, we per|&s;uade our&s;elves, could, at that Time, have been compleated into the Thing it&s;elf; becau&s;e, &s;hould that be deny'd, we find, upon a &s;econd Trial, that, at pre&s;ent, it can. We con&s;ider not, that the fanta&s;tical De&s;ire of &s;howing Liberty is here the Motive of our Actions. And it &s;eems certain, that however we may ima|gine we feel a Liberty within our&s;elves, a Spectator can com|monly infer our Actions from our Motives and Character; and even where he cannot, he concludes in general, that he might, were he perfectly acquainted with every Circum&s;tance of our Si|tuation and Temper, and the mo&s;t &s;ecret Springs of our Com|plexion and Di&s;po&s;ition. Now this is the very E&s;&s;ence of Nece&s;|&s;ity, according to the foregoing Doctrine.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="146">
BUT to proceed in this reconciling Project with re|gard to the Doctrine of Liberty and Nece&s;&s;ity, the mo&s;t contentious Que&s;tion, of Metaphy&s;ics, the mo&s;t contentious Science; it will not require many Words to prove, that all Mankind have ever agreed in the
<PB N="150" REF="147">
 Doctrine of Liberty as well as in that of Nece&s;&s;ity, and that the whole Di&s;pute, in this re&s;pect al&s;o, has been hi|therto merely verbal. For what is meant by Liberty, when apply'd to voluntary Actions? We cannot &s;urely mean, that Actions have &s;o little Connexion with Mo|tives, Inclinations, and Circum&s;tances, that the one does not follow, with a certain Degree of Uniformity, from the other, and that the one affords no Inference, from which we can conclude the Exi&s;tence of the other. For the&s;e are plain and acknowledged Matters of Fact. By Liberty, then, we can only mean, <HI>a Power of acting or not acting, according to the Deter|minations of the Will</HI>; that is, if we chu&s;e to remain at re&s;t, we may; if we chu&s;e to move, we al&s;o may. Now this hypothetical Liberty is univer&s;ally allow'd to belong to every Body, who is not a Pri&s;oner, and in Chains. Here then is no Subject of Di&s;pute.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="148">
WHATEVER Definition we may give of Liberty, we &s;hould be careful to ob&s;erve two requi&s;ite Circum|&s;tances; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that it be con&s;i&s;tent with plain Matter of Fact; <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that it be con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf. If we ob&s;erve the&s;e Circum&s;tances, and render our De|finition intelligible, I am per&s;uaded that all Mankind will be found of one Opinion with regard to it.</P>
<P>'TIS univer&s;ally allow'd, that nothing exi&s;ts with|out a Cau&s;e of its Exi&s;tence, and that Chance, when &s;trictly examin'd, is a mere negative Word, and means not any real Power, which has, any where, a Being in Nature. But 'tis pretended that &s;ome Cau&s;es are nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;ome are not nece&s;&s;ary. Here then is the admirable Advantage of Definitions. Let any one <HI>define</HI> a Cau&s;e, without comprehending, as a Part of the Definition, a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary Connexion</HI> with its Effect; and let him &s;hew di&s;tinctly the Origin of the Idea, ex|pre&s;s'd by the Definition; and I &s;hall frankly give up the whole Controver&s;y. But if the foregoing Expli|cation of the Matter be receiv'd, this mu&s;t be ab&s;o|lutely impracticable. Had not Objects a regular and con&s;tant Conjunction with each other, we &s;hould never have entertain'd any Notion of Cau&s;e and Effect; and this con&s;tant Conjunction produces that Inference of the Under&s;tanding, which is the only Connexion, that we can have any Comprehen&s;ion of. Whoever
<PB N="152" REF="149">
attempts a Definition of Cau&s;e, exclu&s;ive of the&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances, will be oblig'd, either to employ unin|telligible Terms, or &s;uch as are &s;ynonimous to the Term which he endeavours to define<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus if a Cau&s;e be defin'd, <HI>that which produces any thing</HI>; 'tis ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that <HI>producing</HI> is &s;ynonimous to <HI>cau&s;ing.</HI> In like manner, if a Cau&s;e be defin'd, <HI>that by which any thing exi&s;ts</HI>; this is liable to the &s;ame Objection.

<P>THERE is no Method of Rea&s;oning more common, and yet none more blameable, than in philo&s;ophical De|bates, to endeavour the Refutation of any Hypothe&s;is, by a Pretext of its dangerous Con&s;equences to Reli|gion and Morality. When any Opinion leads into Ab&s;urdities, 'tis certainly fal&s;e; but 'tis not certain an Opinion is fal&s;e, becau&s;e 'tis of dangerous Con&s;e|quence. Such Topics, therefore, ought entirely to

be forborn, as &s;erving nothing to the Di&s;covery of Truth, but only to make the Per&s;on of an Antagoni&s;t odious. This I ob&s;erve in general, without pretend|ing to draw any Advantage from it. I &s;ubmit frankly to an Examination of this Kind, and &s;hall venture to affirm, that the Doctrines, both of Nece&s;&s;ity and Li|berty, as above explain'd, are not only con&s;i&s;tent with Morality and Religion, but are ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to them. And fir&s;t, of Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>NECESSITY may be defin'd two Ways, conform|able to the two Definitions of <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> of which it makes an e&s;&s;ential Part. It con&s;i&s;ts either in the con|&s;tant Union and Conjunction of like Objects, or in the Inference of the Under&s;tanding from one Object to another. Now Nece&s;&s;ity, in both the&s;e Sen&s;es, (which, indeed, are, at the Bottom, the &s;ame) has univer&s;ally, tho' tacitly, in the Schools, in the Pulpit, and in common Life, been allow'd to belong to the Will of Man; and no one has ever pretended to deny, that we can draw Inferences concerning human Ac|tions, and that tho&s;e Inferences are founded on the experienc'd Union of like Actions, with like Motives, Inclinations, and Circum&s;tances. The only Particu|lar, in which any one can differ, is, that either, per|haps, he will refu&s;e to give the Name of Nece&s;&s;ity to this Property of human Actions: But as long as the Meaning is under&s;tood, I hope the Word can do no
<PB N="154" REF="151">
Harm: Or that he will maintain it po&s;&s;ible to di&s;co|ver &s;omething farther in the Operations of Matter. But this, it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, can be of no Con|&s;equence to Morality or Religion, whatever it may be to natural Philo&s;ophy or Metaphy&s;ics. We may be mi&s;taken in a&s;&s;erting, that there is no Idea of any o|ther Nece&s;&s;ity or Connexion in the Actions of Body: But &s;urely we here a&s;cribe nothing to the Actions of the Mind, but what every one does, and mu&s;t readily allow of. We change no Circum&s;tance in the re|ceiv'd orthodox Sy&s;tem with regard to the Will, but only in that with regard to material Objects and Cau&s;es. Nothing therefore can be more innocent, at lea&s;t, than this Doctrine. All Laws being founded on Rewards and Puni&s;hments, 'tis &s;uppos'd as a funda|mental Principle, that the&s;e Motives have a regular and uniform Influence on the Mind, and both produce the good and prevent the evil Actions. We may give to this Influence, what Name we plea&s;e; but as 'tis u|&s;ually conjoin'd with the Action, it mu&s;t be e&s;teem'd a <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> and be look'd upon as an In&s;tance of that Nece&s;&s;ity, which we would e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>THE only proper Object of Hatred or Vengeance, is a Per&s;on, or Creature, endow'd with Thought and Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; and when any criminal or injurious Actions excite that Pa&s;&s;ion, 'tis only by their Rela|tion to the Per&s;on, or Connexion with him. Actions
<PB N="155" REF="152">
are, by their very Nature, temporary and peri&s;hing; and where they proceed not from &s;ome <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> in the Characters and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Per&s;on, who per|form'd them, they can neither redound to his Honour, if good, nor Infamy, if evil. The Actions them|&s;elves may be blameable; they may be contrary to all the Rules of Morality and Religion: But the Per|&s;on is not re&s;pon&s;ible for them; and as they proceeded from nothing in him, that is durable and con&s;tant, and leave nothing of that Nature behind them, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible he can, upon their Account, become the Object of Puni&s;hment or Vengeance. According to the Principle therefore, which denies Nece&s;&s;ity, and con&s;equently Cau&s;es, a Man is as pure and untainted, after having committed the mo&s;t horrid Crimes, as at the fir&s;t Moment of his Birth, nor is his Character any way concern'd in his Actions; &s;ince they are not de|riv'd from it, and the Wickedne&s;s of the one can never be us'd as a Proof of the Depravity of the other.</P>
<P>MEN are not blam'd for &s;uch Actions as they per|form ignorantly and ca&s;ually, whatever may be the Con&s;equences. Why? but becau&s;e the Principles of the&s;e Actions are only momentary, and terminate in them alone. Men are le&s;s blam'd for &s;uch evil Ac|tions as they perform ha&s;tily and unpremeditately, than from &s;uch as proceed from Thought and Deliberation.
<PB N="156" REF="153">
For what Rea&s;on? but becau&s;e a ha&s;ty Temper, tho' a con&s;tant Cau&s;e or Principle in the Mind, operates only by Intervals, and infects not the whole Charac|ter. Again, Repentance wipes off every Crime, if attended with a Reformation of Life and Manners. How is this to be accounted for? but by a&s;&s;erting, that Actions render a Per&s;on criminal, merely as they are Proofs of criminal Pa&s;&s;ions or Principles in the Mind; and when, by any Alteration of the&s;e Prin|ciples, they cea&s;e to be ju&s;t Proofs, they likewi&s;e cea&s;o to be criminal. But except upon the Doctrine of Nece&s;&s;ity, they never were ju&s;t Proofs, and con&s;e|quently never were criminal.</P>
<P>IT will be equally ea&s;y to prove, and from the &s;ame Arguments, that <HI>Liberty,</HI> according to that Definition above-mentioned, in which all Men agree, is al&s;o e&s;|&s;ential to Morality, and that no human Actions, where it is wanting, is &s;u&s;ceptible of any moral Qua|lities, or can be the Object either of Approbation or Di&s;like. For as Actions are the Objects of our moral Sentiments, &s;o far only as they are Indications or Proofs of the internal Character, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Affec|tions; 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they can give ri&s;e either to Prai&s;e or Blame, where they proceed not from the&s;e Prin|ciples, but are deriv'd altogether from external Force and Violence.</P>

I PRETEND not to have obviated or remov'd all Objections to this Theory, with regard to Nece&s;&s;ity and Liberty.

It may be &s;aid, for In&s;tance, that if voluntary Actions be &s;ubjected to the &s;ame Laws of Nece&s;&s;ity with the Operations of Matter, there is a continu'd Chain of nece&s;&s;ary Cau&s;es, pre-ordain'd and pre-determin'd, reaching from the original Cau&s;e of all, to every &s;in|gle Volition of every human Creature.

The ultimate Author of all our Voli|tions is the Creator of the World, who fir&s;t be&s;tow'd Motion on this immen&s;e Machine, and plac'd all Be|ings in that particular Po&s;ition, whence every &s;ub&s;e|quent Event, by an inevitable Nece&s;&s;ity, mu&s;t re&s;ult. Human Actions, therefore, can either have no Turpi|tude at all, as proceeding from &s;o good a Cau&s;e; or if they can have any moral Turpitude, they mu&s;t in|volve our Creator in the &s;ame Guilt, while he is ac|knowledged to be their ultimate Cau&s;e and Author. For as a Man, who fired a Mine, is an&s;werable for all the Con&s;equences, whether the Train he employ'd be long or &s;hort; &s;o wherever a continu'd Chain of ne|ce&s;&s;ary Cau&s;es are fix'd, that Being, either finite or
<PB N="158" REF="155">
infinite, who produces the fir&s;t, is likewi&s;e the Author of all the re&s;t, and mu&s;t both bear the Blame, and acquire the Prai&s;e, which belongs to them. Our cleare&s;t and mo&s;t unalterable Ideas of Morality e&s;ta|bli&s;h this Rule, upon unque&s;tionable Rea&s;ons, when we examine the Con&s;equences of any human Action; and the&s;e Rea&s;ons mu&s;t &s;till have greater Force, when apply'd to the Volitions and Intentions of a Being, in|finitely wi&s;e and powerful. Ignorance or Impotence may be pleaded for &s;o limited a Creature as Man; but tho&s;e Imperfections have no Place in our Creator. He fore&s;aw, he ordain'd, he intended all tho&s;e Actions of Men, which we &s;o ra&s;hly pronounce criminal. And we mu&s;t conclude, therefore, either that they are not criminal, or that the Deity, not Man, is re&s;pon&s;ible for them. But as either of the&s;e Po&s;itions is ab&s;urd and impious, it follows, that the Doctrine, from which they are deduc'd, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be true, as being liable to all the &s;ame Objections. An ab&s;urd Con&s;e|quence, if nece&s;&s;ary, proves the original Doctrine to be ab&s;urd; in the &s;ame Manner, that criminal Actions render criminal the original Cau&s;e, if the Connexion betwixt them be nece&s;&s;ary and inevitable.</P>
<P>THIS Objection con&s;i&s;ts of two Parts, which we &s;hall examine &s;eparately; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that if human Actions
<PB N="159" REF="156">
can be trac'd up, by a nece&s;&s;ary Chain, to the Deity, they can never be criminal; on account of the infinite Goodne&s;s and Perfection of that Being, from whom they are deriv'd, and who can intend nothing but what is altogether good and right. Or <HI>Secondly,</HI> if they be criminal, we mu&s;t retract tho&s;e Attributes of Good|ne&s;s and Perfection, which we a&s;cribe to the Deity, and mu&s;t acknowledge him to be the ultimate Author of Guilt and moral Turpitude in all his Creatures.</P>
<P>THE An&s;wer to the fir&s;t Objection &s;eems obvious and convincing. There are many Philo&s;ophers, who, after an exact Scrutiny of all the Phaenomena of Na|ture, conclude, that the WHOLE, con&s;ider'd as one Sy&s;tem, is, in every Period of its Exi&s;tence, order'd with perfect Benevolence and Goodne&s;s; and that the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible Happine&s;s will, in the End, re&s;ult to every created Being, without any Mixture of po&s;itive or ab&s;olute Ill and Mi&s;ery. Every phy&s;ical Ill, &s;ay they, makes an e&s;&s;ential Part of this benevolent Sy|&s;tem, and could not po&s;&s;ibly be remov'd, even by the Deity him&s;elf, con&s;ider'd as a wi&s;e Agent, without giving Entrance to greater Ill, or excluding greater Good, which will re&s;ult from it. From this Theory, &s;ome Philo&s;ophers, and the antient <HI>Stoics</HI> among the re&s;t, deriv'd a Topic of Con&s;olation, under all Afflic|tions, while they taught their Pupils, that tho&s;e Ills,
<PB N="160" REF="157">
they labour'd under, were, in reality, Goods to the Univer&s;e; and that to an enlarg'd View, which could comprehend the whole Sy&s;tem of Nature, every E|vent became an Object of Joy and Exultation. But tho' this Topic be &s;pecious and &s;ublime, it was &s;oon found in Practice weak and ineffectual. You would &s;urely more irritate, than appea&s;e a Man, lying under the racking Pains of the Gout, by preaching up to him the Rectitude of tho&s;e general Laws, which pro|duc'd the malignant Humours in his Body, and led them, thro' the proper Canals, to the Nerves and Si|news, where they now excite &s;uch acute Torments. The&s;e enlarg'd Views may, for a Moment, plea&s;e the Imagination of a &s;peculative Man, who is plac'd in Ea&s;e and Security; but neither can they dwell with Con&s;tancy on his Mind, even tho' undi&s;turb'd by the Emotions of Pain or Pa&s;&s;ion; much le&s;s can they maintain their Ground, when attack'd by &s;uch pow|erful Antagoni&s;ts. The Affections take a narrower and more natural Survey of their Object; and by an Oeconomy, more &s;uitable to the Infirmity of human Minds, regard alone the Objects around us, and are actuated by &s;uch Events as appear good or ill to the private Sy&s;tem. The Ca&s;e is the &s;ame with <HI>moral</HI> as with <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> Ill; nor can it rea&s;onably be &s;uppos'd, that tho&s;e remote Con&s;iderations, which are found of &s;o little Efficacy with regard to the one, will have a
<PB N="161" REF="158">
more powerful Influence with regard to the other. The Mind of Man is &s;o form'd by Nature, that, upon the Appearance of certain Characters, Di&s;po&s;itions, and Actions, it immediately feels the Sentiment of Ap|probation or Blame; nor are there any Feelings or Emotions more e&s;&s;ential to its Frame and Con&s;titution. The Characters, which engage its Approbation, are chiefly &s;uch as contribute to the Peace and Security of human Society; as the Characters, which excite Blame, are chiefly &s;uch as tend to its Detriment and Di&s;turbance: Whence we may rea&s;onably pre&s;ume, that the moral Sentiments ari&s;e, either mediately or immediately, from a Reflection on the&s;e oppo&s;ite Intere&s;ts. What tho' philo&s;ophical Meditations e&s;ta|bli&s;h a different Opinion or Conjecture, that every Thing is right with regard to the WHOLE, and that the Qualities, which di&s;turb Society, are, in the main, as beneficial, and are as &s;uitable to the primary Intention of Nature, as tho&s;e which more directly promote its Happine&s;s and Welfare? Are &s;uch re|mote and uncertain Speculations able to counter|balance the Sentiments, which ari&s;e from the natu|ral and immediate View of the Objects? A Man, who is robb'd of a con&s;iderable Sum; does he find his Vexation for the Lo&s;s a whit dimini&s;h'd by the&s;e &s;ublime Reflections? Why then &s;hould his moral Re&s;entment again&s;t the Crime be &s;uppos'd
<PB N="162" REF="159">
incompatible with them? Or why &s;hould not the Acknowledgment of a real Di&s;tinction betwixt Vice and Virtue be reconcileable to all &s;peculative Sy|&s;tems of Philo&s;ophy, as well as that of a real Di|&s;tinction betwixt per&s;onal Beauty and Deformity? Both the&s;e Di&s;tinctions are founded on the natural Sentiments of the human Mind: And the&s;e Senti|ments are not to be controul'd or alter'd by any philo&s;ophical Theory or Speculation what&s;oever.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> Objection admits not of &s;o ea&s;y and &s;atisfactory an An&s;wer; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to explain di&s;tinctly, how the Deity can be the mediate Cau&s;e of all the Actions of Men, without being the Au|thor of Sin and moral Turpitude. The&s;e are My|&s;teries, which mere natural and una&s;&s;i&s;ted Rea&s;on is very unfit to handle; and whatever Sy&s;tem it em|braces, it mu&s;t find it&s;elf involv'd in inextricable Difficulties, and even Contradictions, at every Step it takes with regard to &s;uch Subjects. To reconcile the Indifference and Contingency of human Actions with Pre&s;cience; or to defend ab&s;olute Decrees, and yet free the Deity from being the Author of Sin, has been found hitherto to exceed all the Skill of Philo&s;ophy. Happy, if &s;he be thence &s;en&s;ible of her Temerity when &s;he pries into the&s;e &s;ublime My&s;teries; and leaving a Scene &s;o full of Ob|&s;curities

and Perplexities, return, with &s;uitable Mo|de&s;ty, to her true and proper Province, the Exa|mination of common Life; where &s;he will find Difficulties enow to employ her Enquiries, with|out launching into &s;o boundle&s;s an Ocean of Doubts, Uncertainties and Contradictions!</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY IX. Of the REASON of ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>ALL our Rea&s;onings concerning Matter of Fact are founded on a Species of ANALOGY, which leads us to expect from any Cau&s;e the &s;ame Events, which we have ob&s;erv'd to re&s;ult from &s;imilar Cau&s;es. Where the Cau&s;es are entirely &s;imilar, the Analogy is perfect, and the Inference, drawn from it, is regarded as certain and conclu&s;ive; nor does any Man ever en|tertain a Doubt, where he &s;ees a Piece of Iron, that it will have Weight and Cohe&s;ion of Parts; as in all other In&s;tances, which have ever fallen under his Ob&s;ervation. But where the Objects have not &s;o ex|act
<PB N="166" REF="162">
a Similarity, the Analogy is le&s;s perfect, and the Inference is le&s;s conclu&s;ive; tho' &s;till it has &s;ome Force, in Proportion to the Degrees of Similarity and Re&s;emblance. The Anatomical Ob&s;ervations, form'd upon one Animal, are, by this Species of Rea&s;oning, extended to all Animals; and 'tis certain, that when the Circulation of the Blood, for In&s;tance, is prov'd clearly to have place in one Creature, as a Frog or Fi&s;h, it forms a &s;trong Pre&s;umption, that the &s;ame Principle has place in all of them. The&s;e analogical Ob&s;ervations may be carry'd farther, even to this Science, of which we are now treating; and any Theory, by which we explain the Operations of the Under&s;tanding or the Origin and Connexion of the Pa&s;&s;ions, in Man, will acquire additional Authority, if we find, that the &s;ame Theory is requi&s;ite to ex|plain the &s;ame Phaenomena, in all other Animals. We &s;hall make Trial of this, with regard to the Hypothe&s;is, by which, in the foregoing E&s;&s;ays, we have endeavour'd to account for all experimental Rea&s;onings; and 'tis hop'd, that this new Point of View will &s;erve to confirm all our former Ob&s;er|vations.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> It &s;eems evident, that Animals, as well as Men, learn many Things from Experience, and infer,
<PB N="167" REF="163">
that the &s;ame Events will always follow from the &s;ame Cau&s;es. By this Principle, they become ac|quainted with the more obvious Properties of exter|nal Objects, and gradually, from their Birth, trea&s;ure up a Knowledge of the Nature of Fire, Water, Earth, Stones, Heights, Depths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and of the Effects that re&s;ult from their Operation. The Ignorance and Inexperience of the Young, is here plainly di|&s;tingui&s;hable from the Cunning and Sagacity of the Old, who have learnt, by long Ob&s;ervation, to avoid what hurt them, and to pur&s;ue what gave Ea&s;e or Plea&s;ure. A Hor&s;e, that has been accu&s;tom'd to the Field, becomes acquainted with the proper Height, which he can leap, and will never attempt what ex|ceeds his Force and Ability. An old Greyhound will tru&s;t the more fatiguing Part of the Chace to the younger, and will place him&s;elf &s;o as to meet the Hare in her Doubles; nor are the Conjectures, which he forms on this Occa&s;ion founded on any Thing but his Ob&s;ervation and Experience.</P>
<P>THIS is &s;till more evident from the Effects of Di&s;|cipline and Education on all Animals, who, by the proper Application of Rewards and Puni&s;hments, may be taught any Cour&s;e of Action, the mo&s;t contrary to their natural In&s;tincts and Propen&s;ities. Is it not
<PB N="168" REF="164">
Experience, which renders a Dog apprehen&s;ive of Pain, when you menace him, or lift up the Whip to beat him? Is it not even Experience, which makes him an&s;wer to his Name, and infer, from &s;uch an arbitrary Sound, that you mean him, rather than any of his Fellows, and intend to call him, when you pronounce it in a certain Manner, and with a certain Tone and Accent?</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e Ca&s;es, we may ob&s;erve, that the Ani|mal infers &s;ome Fact beyond what immediately &s;trikes his Sen&s;es; and that this Inference is altogether founded on pa&s;t Experience, while the Creature ex|pects from the pre&s;ent Object the &s;ame Events, which it has always found in its Ob&s;ervation to re&s;ult from &s;imilar Objects.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, that this Inference of the Animal can be founded on any Proce&s;s of Argu|ment or Rea&s;oning, by which he concludes, that like Events mu&s;t follow like Objects, and that the Cour&s;e of Nature will always be regular in its Operations. For if there be in reality any Arguments of this Na|ture, they &s;urely lie too ab&s;tru&s;e for the Ob&s;ervation of &s;uch imperfect Under&s;tandings; &s;ince it may well employ the utmo&s;t Care and Attention of a philo|&s;ophic Genius to di&s;cover and ob&s;erve them. Ani|mals,
<PB N="169" REF="165">
therefore, are not guided in the&s;e Inferences by Rea&s;oning: Neither are Children: Neither are the Generality of Mankind, in their ordinary Actions and Conclu&s;ions: Neither are Philo&s;ophers them&s;elves, who, in all the active Parts of Life, are, in the main, the &s;ame with the Vulgar, and are govern'd by the &s;ame Maxims. Nature mu&s;t have provided &s;ome other Principle, of more ready, and more ge|neral U&s;e and Application; nor can an Operation of &s;uch immen&s;e Con&s;equence in Life, as that of in|ferring Effects from Cau&s;es, be tru&s;ted to the un|certain Proce&s;s of Rea&s;oning and Argumentation. Were this doubtful with regard to Men, it &s;eems to admit of no Que&s;tion with regard to the Brute-Creation; and the Conclu&s;ion being once firmly e&s;tabli&s;h'd in one, we have a &s;trong Pre&s;umption, from all the Rules of Analogy, that it ought to be univer&s;ally admitted, without any Exception or Re|&s;erve. 'Tis Cu&s;tom alone, which engages Animals, from every Object, that &s;trikes their Sen&s;es, to infer its u&s;ual Attendant, and carries their Imagination, from the Appearance of the one, to conceive the other, in that &s;trong and lively Manner, which we denominate <HI>Belief.</HI> No other Explication can be
<PB N="170" REF="166">
given of this Operation, in all the higher, as well as lower Cla&s;&s;es of &s;en&s;itive Beings, that fall under our Notice and Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Animals learn many Parts of their Knowledge from Ob&s;ervation, there are al&s;o many Parts of it, which they derive from the original Hand of Nature, which mu&s;t exceed the Share of Capacity they po&s;&s;e&s;s on ordinary Occa&s;ions, and in which they improve, little or nothing, by the longe&s;t Practice and Experience. The&s;e we denominate INSTINCTS, and are &s;o apt to admire, as &s;omething very extraordinary, and in|explicable by all the Di&s;qui&s;itions of human Un|der&s;tanding. But our Wonder will, perhaps, cea&s;e or dimini&s;h; when we con&s;ider, that the experi|mental Rea&s;oning it&s;elf, which we po&s;&s;e&s;s in com|mon with Bea&s;ts, and on which the whole Con|duct of Life depends, is nothing but a Species of In&s;tinct or mechanical Power, that acts in us unknown to our&s;elves, and in its chief Opera|tions; is not directed by any &s;uch Relations or Compari&s;ons of Ideas, as are the proper Ob|jects of our intellectual Faculties. Tho' the In|&s;tinct be different, yet &s;till 'tis an In&s;tinct, which teaches a Man to avoid the Fire; as much as
<PB N="171" REF="167">
that, which teaches a Bird, with &s;uch Exactne&s;s, the Art of Incubation, and the whole Oeconomy and Order of its Nur&s;ery.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY X. Of MIRACLES.</HEAD>

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is in Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI>'s Writings an Argu|ment again&s;t the <HI>real Pre&s;ence,</HI> which is as conci&s;e and elegant, and &s;trong as any Argument can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppos'd again&s;t a Doctrine, that is &s;o little worthy of a &s;erious Refutation. 'Tis acknow|ledg'd on all hands, &s;ays that learned Prelate, that the Authority, either of the Scripture or of Tradition, is founded merely on the Te&s;timony of the Apo&s;tles, who were Eye-witne&s;&s;es to tho&s;e Miracles of our Sa|viour, by which he prov'd his divine Mi&s;&s;ion. Our Evidence, then, for the Truth of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Re|ligion is le&s;s than the Evidence for the Truth of our Sen&s;es; becau&s;e, even in the fir&s;t Authors of our Re|ligion, it was no greater; and 'tis evident it mu&s;t di|mini&s;h
<PB N="174" REF="169">
in pa&s;&s;ing from them to their Di&s;ciples; not can any one be &s;o certain of the Truth of their Te&s;ti mony as of the immediate Objects of his Sen&s;es. But a weaker Evidence can never de&s;troy a &s;tronger; und therefore, were the Doctrine of the real Pre&s;ence ever &s;o clearly reveal'd in Scripture, 'twere directly con|trary to the Rules of ju&s;t Rea&s;oning to give our A&s;&s;ent to it. It contradicts Sen&s;e, tho' both the Scripture and Tradition, on which it is &s;uppos'd to be built, carry not &s;uch Evidence with them as Sen&s;e; when they are con&s;ider'd merely as external Evidences, and are not brought home to every one's Brea&s;t, by the immediate Operation of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>NOTHING is &s;o convenient as a deci&s;ive Argu|ment of this Kind, which mu&s;t at lea&s;t <HI>&s;ilence</HI> the mo&s;t arrogant Bigotry and Super&s;tition, and free one from their impertinent Sollicitations. I flatter my&s;elf, that I have di&s;cover'd an Argument of a like Nature, which, if ju&s;t, will, with the Wi&s;e and Learned, be an everla&s;ting Check to all Kinds of &s;uper&s;titious De|lu&s;ion, and con&s;equently, will be u&s;eful as long as the World endures. For &s;o long, I pre&s;ume, will the Accounts of Miracles and Prodigies be found in all prophane Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>THO' Experience be our only Guide in rea&s;oning concerning Matters of Fact; it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd,
<PB N="175" REF="170">
that this Guide is not altogether infallible, but in &s;ome Ca&s;es is apt to lead us into Errors and Mi&s;takes. One, who, in our Climate, &s;hould expect better Wea|ther in any Week of <HI>June</HI> than in one of <HI>December,</HI> would rea&s;on ju&s;tly and conformable to Experience; but 'tis certain, that he may happen, in the Event, to find him&s;elf mi&s;taken. However, we may ob&s;erve, that, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, he would have no Cau&s;e to com|plain of Experience; becau&s;e it commonly informs us beforehand of the Uncertainty, by that Contrariety of Events, which we may learn from a diligent Ob&s;er|vation. All Effects follow not with a like Certainty from their &s;uppos'd Cau&s;es. Some Events are found, in all Countries and all Ages, to have been con&s;tantly conjoin'd together: Others are found to have been more variable, and &s;ometimes to di&s;appoint our Ex|pectations; &s;o that in our Rea&s;onings concerning Matter of Fact, there are all imaginable Degrees of A&s;&s;urance, from the highe&s;t Certainty to the lowe&s;t Species of moral Evidence.</P>
<P>A WISE Man, therefore, proportions his Belief to the Evidence. In &s;uch Conclu&s;ions as are founded on an infallible Experience, he expects the Event with the la&s;t Degree of A&s;&s;urance, and regards his pa&s;t Ex|perience as a full <HI>Proof</HI> of the future Exi&s;tence of that Event. In other Ca&s;es, he proceeds with more Cau|tion: He weighs the oppo&s;ite Experiments: He con|&s;iders
<PB N="176" REF="171">
which Side is &s;upported by the greate&s;t Number of Experiments: To that Side he inclines, with Doubt and He&s;itation; and when at la&s;t he fixes his Judg|ment, the Evidence exceeds not what we properly call <HI>Probability.</HI> All Probability, then, &s;uppo&s;es an Op|po&s;ition of Experiments and Ob&s;ervations; where the one Side is found to over-balance the other, and to produce a Degree of Evidence, proportion'd to the Superiority. A hundred In&s;tances or Experiments on one Side, and fifty on another, afford a very doubt|ful Expectation of any Event; tho' a hundred uni|form Experiments, with only one contradictory one, does rea&s;onably beget a very &s;trong Degree of A&s;&s;u|rance. In all Ca&s;es, we mu&s;t balance the oppo&s;ite Experiments, where they are oppo&s;ite, and deduct the le&s;&s;er Number from the greater, in order to know the exact Force of the &s;uperior Evidence.</P>
<P>To apply the&s;e Principles to a particular In&s;tance; we may ob&s;erve, that there is no Species of Rea&s;oning more common, more u&s;eful, and even nece&s;&s;ary to human Life, than that deriv'd from the Te&s;timony of Men, and the Reports of Eye-witne&s;&s;es and Specta|tors. This Species of Rea&s;oning, perhaps, one may deny to be founded on the Relation of Cau&s;e and Ef|fect. I &s;hall not di&s;pute about a Word. 'Twill be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that our A&s;&s;urance in any Argu|ment of this Kind is deriv'd from no other Principle
<PB N="177" REF="172">
than our Ob&s;ervation of the Veracity of human Te&s;ti|mony, and of the u&s;ual Conformity of Facts to the Reports of Witne&s;&s;es. It being a general Maxim, that no Objects have any di&s;coverable Connexion to|gether, and that all the Inferences we can draw from one to another are founded merely on our Experience of their con&s;tant and regular Conjunction; 'tis evident we ought not to make an Exception to this Maxim in Favour of human Te&s;timony, who&s;e Connexion with any Events &s;eems, in it&s;elf, as little nece&s;&s;ary as any other. Did not Mens Imagination naturally follow their Memory; had they not commonly an Inclina|tion to Truth and a Sentiment of Probity; were they not &s;en&s;ible to Shame, when detected in a Fal&s;hood: Were not the&s;e, I &s;ay, di&s;cover'd by <HI>Experience</HI> to be Qualities, inherent in human Nature, we &s;hould never repo&s;e the lea&s;t Confidence in human Te&s;timony. A Man delirious, or noted for Fal&s;hood and Villany, has no Manner of Weight or Authority with us.</P>
<P>AND as the Evidence, deriv'd from Witne&s;&s;es and human Te&s;timony, is founded on pa&s;t Experience, &s;o it varies with the Experience, and is regarded ei|ther as a <HI>Proof</HI> or a <HI>Probability,</HI> according as the Conjunction betwixt any particular Kind of Report and any Kind of Objects has been found to be con|&s;tant or variable. There are a Number of Circum|&s;tances to be taken into Con&s;ideration in all Judg|ments
<PB N="178" REF="173">
of this Kind; and our ultimate Standard, by which we determine all Di&s;putes, that may ari&s;e con|cerning them, is always deriv'd from Experience and Ob&s;ervation. Where this Experience is not intirely uniform on any Side, 'tis attended with an unavoidable Contrariety in our Judgments, and with the &s;ame Op|po&s;ition and mutual De&s;truction of Arguments as in every other Kind of Evidence. We frequently he&s;i|tate concerning the Reports of others. We balance the oppo&s;ite Circum&s;tances, that cau&s;e any Doubt or Uncertainty; and when we di&s;cover a Superiority on any Side, we incline to it; but &s;till with a Diminu|tion of A&s;&s;urance, in proportion to the Force of its Antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS Contrariety of Evidence, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, may be deriv'd from &s;everal different Cau&s;es; from the Oppo&s;ition of contrary Te&s;timony; from the Cha|racter or Number of the Witne&s;&s;es; from the Manner of their delivering their Te&s;timony; or from the U|nion of all the&s;e Circam&s;tances. We entertain a Su&s;pi|cion concerning any Matter of Fact, when the Witne&s;&s;es contradict each other; when they are but few, or of a &s;u&s;picious Character; when they have an Intere&s;t in what they affirm; when they deliver their Te&s;timony with Doubt and He&s;itation, or on the contrary, with too violent A&s;&s;everations. There are many other Par|iculars of the &s;ame Kind, which may dimini&s;h or de|&s;troy
<PB N="179" REF="174">
the Force of any Argument, deriv'd from hu|man Te&s;timony.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, for In&s;tance, that the Fact, which the Te&s;timony endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h, partakes of the Ex|traordinary and the Marvellous; in that Ca&s;e, the Evidence, re&s;ulting from the Te&s;timony, receives a Diminution, greater or le&s;s, in proportion as the Fact is more or le&s;s unu&s;ual. The Rea&s;on, why we place any Credit in Witne&s;&s;es and Hi&s;torians is not from any <HI>Connexion</HI> we perceive <HI>a priori</HI> betwixt Te&s;timony and Reality, but becau&s;e we are accu&s;tom'd to find a Con|formity betwixt them. But when the Fact atte&s;ted is &s;uch a one as has &s;eldom fallen under our Ob&s;ervation, here is a Conte&s;t of two oppo&s;ite Experiences; of which the one de&s;troys the other as far as its Force goes, and the Superior can only operate on the Mind by the Force, which remains. The very &s;ame Prin|ciple of Experience, which gives us a certain Degree of A&s;&s;urance in the Te&s;timony of Witne&s;&s;es, gives us al&s;o, in this Ca&s;e, another Degree of A&s;&s;urance again&s;t the Fact, which they endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h; from which Contradiction there nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;es a Counter|poize, and mutual De&s;truction of Belief and Au|thority.</P>
<P>BUT in order to increa&s;e the Probability again&s;t the Te&s;timony of Witne&s;&s;es, let us &s;uppo&s;e, that the Fact,
<PB N="180" REF="175">
which they affirm, in&s;tead of being only marvellous, is really miraculous; and &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o, that the Te|&s;timony, con&s;ider'd apart, and in it&s;elf, amounts to an entire Proof; in that Ca&s;e there is Proof again&s;t Proof, of which the &s;tronge&s;t mu&s;t prevail, but &s;till with a Diminution of its Force, in proportion to that of its Antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>A MIRACLE is a Violation of the Laws of Na|ture; and as a firm and inalterable Experience has e&s;tabli&s;h'd the&s;e Laws, the Proof again&s;t a Miracle, from the very Nature of the Fact, is as entire as any Argument from Experience can po&s;&s;ibly be imagin'd, Why is it more than probable, that all Men mu&s;t die; that Lead cannot, of it&s;elf, remain &s;u&s;pended in the Air; that Fire con&s;umes Wood, and is extingui&s;h'd by Water; unle&s;s it be that the&s;e Events are found agreeable to the Laws of Nature, and there is re|quir'd a Violation of the&s;e Laws, or in other Words, a Miracle, to prevent them? Nothing is e&s;teem'd a Miracle if it ever happen in the common Cour&s;e of Nature. 'Tis no Miracle that a Man in &s;eeming good Health &s;hould die of a &s;udden; becau&s;e &s;uch a Kind of Death, tho' more unu&s;ual than any other, has yet been frequently ob&s;erv'd to happen. But 'tis a Mi|racle, that a dead Man &s;hould come to Life; becau&s;e that has never been ob&s;erv'd, in any Age or Country. There mu&s;t, therefore, be an uniform Experience
<PB N="181" REF="176">
again&s;t every miraculous Event, otherwi&s;e the Event would not merit that Appellation. And as an uniform Experience amounts to a Proof, there is here a direct and full <HI>Proof,</HI> from the Nature of the Fact, again&s;t the Exi&s;tence of any Miracle; nor can &s;uch a Proof be de&s;troy'd, or the Miracle render'd credible, but by an oppo&s;ite Proof, that is &s;uperior<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sometimes an Event may not, <HI>in it&s;elf, &s;eem</HI> to be contrary to the Laws of Nature, and yet, if it were real, it might, by rea|&s;on of &s;ome Circum&s;tances, be denominated a Miracle, becau&s;e, <HI>in Fact,</HI> it is contrary to the&s;e Laws. Thus if a Per&s;on, claim|ing a divine Authority, &s;hould command a &s;ick Per&s;on to be well, a healthful Man to fall down dead, the Clouds to pour Rain, the Winds to blow, in &s;hort, &s;hould order many natural Events, which immediately follow upon his Command; the&s;e might ju&s;tly be e&s;teem'd Miracles, becau&s;e they are really, in this Ca&s;e, contrary to the Laws of Nature. For if any Su&s;picion remain, that the Event and Command concurr'd by Accident, there is no Miracle and no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Laws of Nature. If this Su|&s;picion be remov'd, there is evidently a Miracle, and a Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Laws; becau&s;e nothing can be more contrary to Nature than that the Voice or Command of a Man &s;hould have &s;uch an Influence.

This alters not its Nature and E&s;&s;ence. The rai&s;ing of a Hou&s;e or Ship into the Air is a vi|&s;ible Miracle. The rai&s;ing a Feather, when the Wind wants ever &s;o little of a Force requi&s;ite for that Purpo&s;e, is as real a Mi|racle, tho' not &s;o &s;en&s;ible with regard to us.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>IN the foregoing Rea&s;oning we have &s;uppos'd, that the Te&s;timony, upon which a Miracle is founded, may po&s;&s;ibly amount to an entire Proof, and that the Fal&s;hood of that Te&s;timony would be a kind of Pro|digy.

SECONDLY. We may ob&s;erve in human Nature a Principle, which, if &s;trictly examin'd, will be found to dimini&s;h extremely the A&s;&s;urance we might have, from human Te&s;timony, in any Kind of Prodigy. The Maxim, by which we commonly conduct our&s;elves in our Rea&s;onings, is, that the Objects, of which we have no Experience, re&s;emble tho&s;e, of which we have; that what we have found to be mo&s;t u&s;ual is always mo&s;t probable; and that where there is any Oppo&s;ition of Arguments we ought to give the Pre|ference to &s;uch of them as are founded on the greate&s;t Number of pa&s;t Ob&s;ervations. But tho' in proceed|ing by this Rule, we readily reject any Fact, that is unu&s;ual and incredible in an ordinary Degree; yet in advancing farther, the Mind ob&s;erves not always the &s;ame Rule; but when any Thing is affirm'd utterly ab&s;urd and miraculous, it rather the more readily ad|mits &s;uch a Fact, upon account of that very Circum|&s;tance, which ought to de&s;troy all its Authority. The Pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Surprize</HI> and <HI>Wonder,</HI> ari&s;ing from Miracles, being an agreeable Emotion, gives a &s;en&s;ible Ten|dency towards the Belief of tho&s;e Events, from which it is deriv'd. And this goes &s;o far, that even tho&s;e who cannot enjoy this Plea&s;ure immediately, nor can believe tho&s;e miraculous Events, of which they are inform'd, yet love to partake of the Satisfaction at Second-hand, or by Rebound, and place a Pride and Delight in exciting the Admiration of others.</P>

WITH what Greedine&s;s are the miraculous Accounts of Travellers receiv'd, their De&s;criptions of Sea and Land-Mon&s;ters, their Relations of wonderful Adven|tures, &s;trange Men, and uncouth Manners?

A Religioni&s;t may be an Enthu&s;ia&s;t, and imagine he &s;ees what has no Reality: He may know his Narration to be fal&s;e, and yet per&s;evere in it, with the be&s;t Intentions in the World, for the &s;ake of promot|ing &s;o holy a Cau&s;e: Or even where this Delu&s;ion has no Place, Vanity, excited by &s;o &s;trong a Temptation, operates on him more powerfully than on the re&s;t of Mankind in any other Circum&s;tances; and Self-In|tere&s;t with equal Force.

This is our natural Way of thinking even with regard to the mo&s;t common and mo&s;t credible Events. For In&s;tance: There is no Kind of Report, which ri&s;es &s;o ea&s;ily, and &s;preads &s;o quickly, e&s;pecially in Country-places and Provincial Towns, as tho&s;e concerning Marriages; in&s;omuch as two young Per&s;ons of equal.

<P>THIRDLY. It forms a very &s;trong Pre&s;umption a|gain&s;t all &s;upernatural and miraculous Relations, that
<PB N="187" REF="182">
they are always found chiefly to abound among&s;t ig|norant and barbarous Nations; or if a civiliz'd Peo|ple has ever given Admi&s;&s;ion to any of them, that People will be found to have receiv'd them from ig|norant and barbarous Ance&s;tors, who tran&s;mitted them with that inviolable Sanction and Authority, which al|ways attends antient and receiv'd Opinions. When we peru&s;e the fir&s;t Hi&s;tories of all Nations, we are apt to imagine our&s;elves tran&s;ported into &s;ome new World, where the whole Frame of Nature is disjointed, and every Element performs its Operations in a different Manner, from what it does at pre&s;ent. Battles, Re|volutions, Pe&s;tilences, Famines, and Deaths are ne|ver the Effects of tho&s;e natural Cau&s;es, which we ex|perience. Prodigies, Omens, Oracles, Judgments quite ob&s;cure and over-&s;hadow the few natural Events, that are intermingled with them. But as the&s;e grow thinner every Page, in Proportion as we advance nearer the enlighten'd Ages of Science and Knowledge, we &s;oon learn, that there is nothing my&s;terious or &s;upernatural in the Ca&s;e, but that all proceeds from the u&s;ual Pro|pen&s;ity of Mankind towards the Marvellous and Ex|traordinary, and that tho' this Inclination may at In|tervals receive a Check from Sen&s;e and Learning, it can never be thoroughly extirpated from human Na|ture.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="183">
<HI>'Tis &s;trange,</HI> a judicious Reader is apt to &s;ay, upon the Peru&s;al of the&s;e wonderful Hi&s;torians, <HI>that &s;uch prodigious Events never happen in our Days.</HI> But 'tis nothing &s;trange, I hope, that Men &s;hould lye in all Ages. You mu&s;t &s;urely have &s;een In&s;tances enow of that Frailty. You have your&s;elf heard many &s;uch prodigious Relations &s;tarted, which being treated with Scorn by all the Wi&s;e and Judicious, have at la&s;t been abandon'd, even by the Vulgar. Be a&s;&s;ur'd, that tho&s;e renown'd Lyes, which have &s;pread and flouri&s;h'd to &s;uch a mon&s;trous Height, aro&s;e from like Begin|nings; but being &s;own on a more proper Soil, &s;hot up at la&s;t into Prodigies almo&s;t equal to tho&s;e, which they relate.</P>
<P>'Twas a wi&s;e Policy in that cunning Impo&s;tor, <HI>Alex|ander,</HI> who, tho' now forgotten, was once &s;o famous, to lay the fir&s;t Scene of his Impo&s;tures in <HI>Paphlagonia,</HI> where, as <HI>Lucian</HI> tells us, the People were extremely ignorant and &s;tupid, and ready to &s;wallow even the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Delu&s;ion. People at a Di&s;tance, who are weak enough to think the Matter at all worth Enquiry, have no Opportunity of receiving better Information. The Stories come magnify'd to them by a hundred Circum&s;tances. Fools are indu&s;trious to propagate the Delu&s;ion; while the Wi&s;e and Learned are contented, in general, to deride its Ab&s;urdity, without informing them&s;elves of the particular Facts, by which it may be
<PB N="189" REF="184">
di&s;tinctly refuted. And thus the Impo&s;tor above-men|tioned was enabled to proceed, from his ignorant <HI>Paphlagonians,</HI> to the inli&s;ting of Votaries, even a|mong the <HI>Grecian</HI> Philo&s;ophers, and Men of the mo&s;t eminent Rank and Di&s;tinction in <HI>Rome.</HI> Nay could engage the Attention of that &s;age Emperor, <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI>; &s;o far as to make him tru&s;t the Succe&s;s of a military Expedition to his delu&s;ive Prophecies.</P>
<P>THE Advantages are &s;o great of &s;tarting an Im|po&s;ture among&s;t an ignorant People, that even tho, the Delu&s;ion &s;hould be too gro&s;s to impo&s;e on the Ge|nerality of them (<HI>which, tho' &s;eldom, is &s;ometimes the Ca&s;e</HI>) it has a much better Chance of &s;ucceeding in re|mote Countries, than if the fir&s;t Scene had been laid in a City renown'd for Arts and Knowledge. The mo&s;t ignorant and barbarous of the&s;e Barbarians carry the Report abroad. None of their Countrymen have large enough Corre&s;pondence or &s;ufficient Credit and Authority to contradict and beat down the Delu&s;ion. Men's Inclination to the Marvellous has full Opportu|nity to di&s;play it&s;elf. And thus a Story &s;hall pa&s;s for certain at a thou&s;and Miles Di&s;tance, which is univer|&s;ally exploded in the Place where it was fir&s;t &s;tarted. But had <HI>Alexander</HI> fix'd his Re&s;idence at <HI>Athens,</HI> the Philo&s;ophers of that renown'd Mart of Learning, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">mmediately &s;pread, thro' the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">heir Sen&s;e of the Matter, which, being &s;upported by

But, tho' much to be wi&s;h'd, it does not always happen, that every <HI>Alexander</HI> meets with a <HI>Lucian,</HI> ready to expo&s;e and detect his Im|po&s;tures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may here, perhaps, be objected, that I proceed ra&s;hly, and form my Notions of <HI>Alexander</HI> merely from the Account, given of him by <HI>Lucian,</HI> a profe&s;s'd Enemy.

<P>I MAY add as a fourth Rea&s;on, which dimini&s;hes the Authority of Prodigies, that there is no Te&s;ti|mony for any, even tho&s;e which have not been ex|pre&s;sly detected, that is not oppos'd by an infinite Number of Witne&s;&s;es; &s;o that not only the Miracle de&s;troys the Credit of the Te&s;timony, but even the Te&s;timony de&s;troys it&s;elf. To make this the better under&s;tood, let us con&s;ider, that, in Matters of Re|ligion, whatever is different is contrary, and that 'tis
<PB N="191" REF="186">
impo&s;&s;ible the Religions of antient <HI>Rome,</HI> of <HI>Turkey,</HI> of <HI>Siam,</HI> and of <HI>China</HI> &s;hould all of them be e&s;tabli&s;h'd on any &s;olid Foundation. Every Miracle, therefore, pretended to have been wrought in any of the&s;e Re|ligions (and all of them abound in Miracles) as its di|rect Scope is to e&s;tabli&s;h the particular Sy&s;tem, to which it is attributed; &s;o it has the &s;ame Force, tho' more indirectly, to overthrow every other Sy&s;tem. In de&s;troying a Rival-Sy&s;tem, it likewi&s;e de&s;troys the Credit of tho&s;e Miracles, on which that Sy&s;tem was e&s;tabli&s;h'd; &s;o that all the Prodigies of different Re|ligions are to be regarded as contrary Facts, and the Evidences of the&s;e Prodigies, whether weak or &s;trong, as oppo&s;ite to each other. According to this Method of Rea&s;oning, when we believe any Miracle of <HI>Ma|homet</HI> or any of his Succe&s;&s;ors, we have for our War|rant the Te&s;timony of a few barbarous <HI>Arabians:</HI> and on the other &s;ide, we are to regard the Authority of <HI>Titas Livius, Platarch, Tacitus,</HI> and in &s;hort of all the Authors and Witne&s;&s;es, <HI>Grecian, Chine&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Roman Catholic,</HI> who have related any Miracles in their par|ticular Religion; I &s;ay, we are to regard their Te&s;ti|mony in the &s;ame Light as if they had mention'd that <HI>Mahometan</HI> Miracle, and had in expre&s;s Terms con|tradicted it, with the &s;ame Certainty as they have for the Miracles they relate. This Argument may ap|pear over-&s;ubtile and refin'd; but is not in Reality different from the Rea&s;oning of a Judge, who &s;up|po&s;es,
<PB N="192" REF="187">
that the Credit of two Witne&s;&s;es, maintaining a Crime again&s;t any one, is de&s;troy'd by the Te&s;ti|mony of two others, who affirm him to have been two hundred Leagues di&s;tant, at the &s;ame In&s;tant when the Crime is &s;aid to have been committed.</P>
<P>ONE of the be&s;t atte&s;ted Miracles in all prophane Hi&s;tory is that which <HI>Tacitus</HI> reports of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> who cur'd a blind Man in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> by Means of his Spittle, and a lame Man by the mere Touch of his Foot; in Obedience to a Vi&s;ion of the God, <HI>Serapis,</HI> who had enjoin'd them to have recour&s;e to the Em|peror, for the&s;e miraculous and extraordinary Cures, The Story may be &s;een in that fine Hi&s;torian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

The Gravity, So|lidity, Age, and Probity of &s;o great an Emperor, who, thro' the whole Coar&s;e of his Life, convers'd in a familiar Way with his Friends and Courtiers, and never affected tho&s;e extraordinary Airs of Divinity, a&s;&s;um'd by <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Demetrius.</HI> The Hi&s;torian, a contemporary Writer, noted for Candour and Ve|racity, and withal, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t penetrating Genius, perhaps, of all Antiquity; and &s;o free from
<PB N="193" REF="188">
eny Tendency to Super&s;tition and Credulity, that he even lies under the contrary Imputation, of Athei&s;m and Prophanene&s;s: The Per&s;ons, from who&s;e Te&s;ti|mony he related the Miracle, of e&s;tabli&s;h'd Character for Judgment and Veracity, as we may well &s;uppo&s;e; Eye-witne&s;&s;es of the Fact, and confirming their Verdict, after the <HI>Flavian</HI> Family were de&s;poil'd of the Em|pire, and could no longer give any Reward, as the Price of a Lye. <HI>Utrumque, qui interfuere, nunc quo|que memorant, po&s;tquam nullum mendacis pretium.</HI> To which if we add the public Nature of the Fact, as re|lated, it will appear, that no Evidence can well be &s;uppos'd &s;tronger for &s;o gro&s;s and &s;o palpable a Fal&s;|hood.</P>
<P>THERE is al&s;o a very memorable Story related by <HI>Cardinal de Retz,</HI> and which may well de&s;erve our Con&s;ideration. When that intriguing Politician fled into <HI>Spain,</HI> to avoid the Per&s;ecution of his Enemies, he pa&s;s'd thro' <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Arragon,</HI> where he was &s;hewn, in the Cathedral Church, a Man, who had &s;erv'd twenty Years as a Door-keeper of the Church, and was well known to every Body in Town, that had ever paid their Devotions at that Cathedral. He had been &s;een, for &s;o long a Time, wanting a Leg; but recover'd that Limb by the rubbing of holy Oil upon the Stump; and when the Cardinal examin'd it, he found it to be a true natural Leg, like the other.
<PB N="194" REF="189">
This Miracle was vouch'd by all the Canons of the Church; and the whole Company in Town was ap|pealed to for a Confirmation of the Fact; whom the Cardinal found, by their zealous Devotion, to be thorough Believers of the Miracle. Here the Re|later was al&s;o contemporary to the &s;uppos'd Prodigy, of an incredulous and libertine Character as well as of great Genius, the Miracle of &s;o <HI>&s;ingular</HI> a Nature as could &s;carce admit of a Counterfeit, and the Witne&s;&s;es very numerous, and all of them, in a Manner, Spec|tators of the Fact, to which they gave their Te&s;timony. And what adds mightily to the Force of the Evidence, and may double our Surprize on this Occa&s;ion, is, that the Cardinal him&s;elf, who relates the Story, &s;eems not to give any Credit to it, and con&s;equently cannot be &s;u&s;pected of any Concurrence in the holy Fraud. He con&s;ider'd ju&s;tly, that it was not requi&s;ite, in order to reject a Fact of this Nature, to be able accurately to di&s;prove the Te&s;timony, and to trace its Fal&s;hood, thro' all the Circum&s;tances of Knavery and Credulity, which produc'd it. He knew, that as this was com|monly altogether impo&s;&s;ible, at any &s;mall Di&s;tance of Time and Place; &s;o was it extremely difficult, even where one was immediately pre&s;ent, by Rea&s;on of the Bigotry, Ignorance, Cunning, and Roguery of a great Part of Mankind. He therefore concluded, like a ju&s;t Rea&s;oner, that &s;uch an Evidence carry'd Fal&s;hood upon the very Face of it, and that a Miracle,
<PB N="195" REF="190">
&s;upported by any human Te&s;timony, was more pro|perly a Subject of Deri&s;ion than of Argument.</P>
<P>THERE &s;urely never was &s;o great a Number of Mi|racles a&s;crib'd to one Per&s;on, as tho&s;e, which were lately &s;aid to have been wrought in <HI>France</HI> upon the Tomb of <HI>Abb&eacute; Paris,</HI> the famous <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;t,</HI> with who&s;e Sanctity the People were &s;o long deluded. The curing of the Sick, giving Hearing to the Deaf, and Sight to the Blind were every where talk'd of, as the u&s;ual Effects of that holy Sepulchre. But what is more extraordinary; many of the Miracles were imme|diately prov'd, upon the Spot, before Judges of un|que&s;tion'd Integrity, atte&s;ted by Witne&s;&s;es of Credit and Di&s;tinction, in a learned Age, and on the mo&s;t eminent Theatre, that is now in the World. Nor is this all: A Relation of them was publi&s;h'd, and di|&s;pers'd every where; nor were the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> tho' a learned Body, &s;upported by the civil Magi&s;trate, and determin'd Enemies to tho&s;e Opinions, in who&s;e Fa|vour the Miracles were &s;aid to have been wrought, ever able di&s;tinctly to refute or detect them. Where &s;hall we find &s;uch a Number of Circum&s;tances, agreeing to the Corroboration of one Fact? And what have we to oppo&s;e to &s;uch a Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es, but the ab&s;olute Impo&s;&s;ibility or miraculous Nature of the Events, which they relate? And this &s;urely, in the Eyes of all rea&s;onable People, will alone be regarded as a &s;uf|ficient Refutation.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="191">
Is the Con&s;equence ju&s;t; becau&s;e &s;ome human Te|&s;timony has the utmo&s;t Force and Authority in &s;ome Ca&s;es, when it relates the Battles of <HI>Philippi</HI> or <HI>Phar|&s;alia,</HI> for In&s;tance; that therefore all Kinds of Te&s;ti|mony mu&s;t, in all Ca&s;es, have equal Force and Au|thority? Suppo&s;e the <HI>Cae&s;arean</HI> and <HI>Pompeian</HI> Factions had, each of them, challeng'd the Victory in the&s;e Battles, and the Hi&s;torians of each Party had uni|formly a&s;crib'd the Advantage to their own Side; how could Mankind, at this Di&s;tance, have been able to determine betwixt them? The Contrariety is equally &s;trong betwixt the Miracles related by <HI>Herodotus</HI> or <HI>Plutarch,</HI> and tho&s;e related by <HI>Mariana, Bede,</HI> or any monki&s;h Hi&s;torian.</P>

But what greater Temp|tation than to appear a Mi&s;&s;ionary, a Prophet, an Am|ba&s;&s;ador from Heaven? Who would not encounter many Dangers and Difficulties, to attain &s;o &s;ublime a Character? Or if, by the Help of Vanity and a heated Imagination, a Man has fir&s;t made a Convert of him|&s;elf, and enter'd &s;eriou&s;ly into the Delu&s;ion; who

<P>THE &s;malle&s;t Spark may here kindle into the great|e&s;t Flame; becau&s;e the Materials are always prepar'd for it. The <HI>avidum genus auricularum,</HI> &s;wallow greedily, without Examination, whatever &s;ooths Su|per&s;tition, and promotes Wonder.</P>
<P>How many Stories of this Nature have, in all Ages, been detected and exploded in their Infancy? How many more have been celebrated for a Time, and have afterwards &s;unk into Neglect and Oblivion? Where &s;uch Reports, therefore, fly about, the Solu|tion of the Phaenomenon is obvious; and we judge in Conformity to regular Experience and Ob&s;ervation, when we account for it by the known and natural Principles of Credulity and Delu&s;ion. And &s;hall we, rather than have Recour&s;e to &s;o natural a Solution, allow of a miraculous Violation of the mo&s;t known and mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd Laws of Nature?</P>
<P>I NEED not mention the Difficulty of detecting a Fal&s;hood in any private or even public Hi&s;tory, at the Time and Place, where it is &s;aid to happen; much more where the Scene is remov'd to ever &s;o &s;mall a Di&s;tance. Even a Court of Judicature, with all the Authority, Accuracy, and Judgment, which they can
<PB N="198" REF="193">
employ, find them&s;elves often at a lo&s;s to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt Truth and Fal&s;hood in the mo&s;t recent Ac|tions. But the Matter never comes to any I&s;&s;ue, if tru&s;ted to the common Method of Altercation and De|bate and flying Rumours; e&s;pecially when Men's Pa&s;&s;ions have taken party on either Side.</P>
<P>IN the Infancy of new Religions, the Wi&s;e and Learned commonly e&s;teem the Matter too incon&s;ide|rable to de&s;erve their Attention or Regard: And when afterwards they would willingly detect the Cheat, in order to undeceive the deluded Multitude, the Sea&s;on is now gone, and the Records and Witne&s;&s;es, who might clear up the Matter, have peri&s;h'd beyond Re|covery.</P>
<P>NO Means of Detection remain, but tho&s;e which mu&s;t be drawn from the very Te&s;timony it&s;elf of the Reporters: And the&s;e, tho' always &s;ufficient with the Judicious and Knowing, are commonly too fine to fall under the Comprehen&s;ion of the Vulgar.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, then, it appears, that no Te&s;ti|mony for any Kind of Miracle can ever po&s;&s;ibly a|mount to a Probability, much le&s;s to a Proof; and that even &s;uppo&s;ing it amounted to a Proof, 'twould be oppos'd by another Proof, deriv'd from the very Nature of the Fact, which it would endeavour to e&s;ta|bli&s;h.
<PB N="199" REF="194">
'Tis Experience only, which gives Authority to human Te&s;timony; and 'tis the &s;ame Experience, which a&s;&s;ures us of the Laws of Nature. When, there|fore, the&s;e two Kinds of Experience are contrary, we have nothing to do but &s;ubtract the one from the other, and embrace an Opinion, either on the one Side or the other, with that A&s;&s;urance, which ari&s;es from the Remainder. But according to the Principle here ex|plain'd, this Subtraction, with regard to all popular Religions, amounts to an entire Annihilation; and therefore we may e&s;tabli&s;h it as a Maxim, that no hu|man Te&s;timony can have &s;uch Force as to prove a Mi|racle, and make it a ju&s;t Foundation for any &s;uch Sy|&s;tem of Religion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I beg the Limitation here made may be remark'd, when I &s;ay, that a Miracle can never be prov'd, &s;o as to be the Founda|tion of a Sy&s;tem of Religion. For I own, that otherwi&s;e, there may po&s;&s;ibly be Miracles, or Violations of the u&s;ual Cour&s;e of Na|ture, of &s;uch a Kind as to admit of Proof from human Te&s;timony; tho', perhaps, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to find any &s;uch in all the Records of Hi&s;tory. Thus &s;uppo&s;e, all Authors, in all Lan|guages, agree, that from the fir&s;t of <HI>January</HI> 1600, there was a total Darkne&s;s over the whole Earth for eight Days: Suppo&s;e that the Tradition of this extraordinary Event, is &s;till &s;trong and lively among the People: That all Travellers, who return from foreign Countries, bring us Accounts of the &s;ame Tradition, without the lea&s;t Variation or Contradiction; 'tis evident, that our pre&s;ent Philo&s;ophers, in&s;tead of doubting of that Fact, ought to receive it for certain, and ought to &s;earch for the Cau&s;es, whence it might be deriv'd.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e, that all the Hi&s;torians, who treat of <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould agree, that on the fir&s;t of <HI>January</HI> 1600, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> died; that both before and after her Death &s;he was &s;een by her Phy&s;icians and the whole Court, as is u&s;ual with Per&s;ons of her Rank; that her Succe&s;&s;or was acknowledg'd and proclaim'd by the Parliament; and that, after having been interr'd a Month, &s;he again appear'd, took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Throne, and govern'd <HI>England</HI> for three Years: I mu&s;t confe&s;s I &s;hould be &s;urpriz'd at the Concurrence of &s;o many odd Circum&s;tances, but &s;hould not have the lea&s;t Inclination to believe &s;o miraculous an Event. I &s;hould not doubt of her pretended Death, and of tho&s;e other public Circum&s;tances, that follow'd it: I &s;hould only a&s;&s;ert it to have been pretended, and that it neither was, nor po&s;&s;ibly could be real. You would in vain object to me the Difficulty, and almo&s;t Im|po&s;&s;ibility of deceiving the World in an Affair of &s;uch Con&s;e|quence; the Wi&s;dom and Integrity of that renown'd Queen; with the little or no Advantage &s;he could reap from &s;o poor an Artifice: All this might a&s;toni&s;h me; but I would &s;till reply, that the Knavery and Folly of Men are &s;uch common Phaeno|mena, that I &s;hould rather believe the mo&s;t extraordinary Events to ari&s;e from their Concurrence than admit &s;o &s;ingle a Violation of the Laws of Nature.</P>
<P>But &s;hould this Miracle be a&s;crib'd to any new Sy&s;tem of Re|ligion; Men, in all Ages, have been &s;o much impos'd on by ri|diculous Stories of that Kind; that this very Circum&s;tance would be a full Proof of a Cheat, and &s;ufficient, with all Men of Sen&s;e, not only to make them reject the Fact, but even reject it without farther Examination. Tho' the Being, to whom the Miracle is a&s;crib'd, be, in this Ca&s;e, Almighty, it does not, upon that Ac|count, become a whit more probable; &s;ince 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for us to know the Attributes or Actions of &s;uch a Being, otherwi&s;e than from the Experience, which we have, of his Productions, in the u&s;ual Cour&s;e of Nature. This &s;till reduces us to pa&s;t Ob|&s;ervation, and obliges us to compare the In&s;tances of the Viola|tions of Truth in the Te&s;timony of Men with tho&s;e of the Vio|lation of the Laws of Nature by Miracles, in order to judge which of them is mo&s;t likely and probable. As the Violations of Truth are more common in the Te&s;timony concerning religious Miracles than in that concerning any other Matter of Fact; this mu&s;t di|mini&s;h very much the Authority of the former Te&s;timony, and make us form a general Re&s;olution never to lend any Attention to it, with whatever &s;pecious Pretext it may be cover'd.</P></NOTE>.</P>

Friends or di&s;guis'd Enemies to the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> who have undertaken to defend it by the Principles of human Rea&s;on. Our mo&s;t holy Religion is founded on <HI>Faith,</HI> not on Rea&s;on; and 'tis a &s;ure Method of expo&s;ing it to put it to &s;uch a Trial as it is, by no Means, fitted to endure.

Here then we are fir&s;t to con&s;ider a Book, pre&s;ented to us by a barbarous and ignorant People, wrote in an Age when they were

&s;till more barbarous, and in all Probability long after the Facts it relates; corroborated by no concurring Te&s;timony, and re&s;embling tho&s;e fabulous Accounts, which every Nation gives of its Origin. Upon read|ing this Book, we find it full of Prodigies and Mi|racles. It gives an Account of a State of the World and of human Nature entirely different from the pre|&s;ent: Of our Fall from that State: Of the Age of Man, extended to near a thou&s;and Years: Of the De|&s;truction of the World by a Deluge: Of the arbitrary Choice of one People, as the Favourites of Heaven; and that People, the Countrymen of the Author: Of their Deliverance from Bondage by Prodigies the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing imaginable: I de&s;ire any one to lay his Hand upon his Heart, and after &s;erious Con&s;ideration declare, whether he thinks, that the Fal&s;hood of &s;uch a Book, &s;upported by &s;uch a Te&s;timony, would be more extraordinary and miraculous than all the Mi|racles it relates; which is, however, nece&s;&s;ary to make it be receiv'd, according to the Mea&s;ures of Probability above e&s;tabli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>WHAT we have &s;aid of Miracles may be apply'd, without any Variation, to Prophecies; and indeed, all Prophecies are real Miracles, and as &s;uch only, can be admitted as Proofs of any Revelation.

<HEAD>ESSAY XI. Of the PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES of NATURAL RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS lately engag'd in Conver&s;ation with a Friend, who loves &s;ceptical Paradoxes; where, tho' he advanc'd many Principles, which I can by no means approve of, yet as they &s;eem to be curious, and bear &s;ome relation to the Chain of Rea&s;oning carry'd on thro' the&s;e E&s;&s;ays, I &s;hall here copy them from my Memory as accurately as I can, in order to &s;ubmit them to the Judgment of the Reader.</P>
<P>OUR Conver&s;ation began with my admiring the &s;ingular good Fortune of Philo&s;ophy, which, as it re|quires entire Liberty, above all other Privileges, and flouri&s;hes chiefly from the free Oppo&s;ition of Senti|ments and Argumentation, receiv'd its fir&s;t Birth in an Age and Country of Freedom and Toleration, and
<PB N="206" REF="200">
was never cramp'd, even in its mo&s;t extravagant Prin|ciples, by any Creeds, Confe&s;&s;ions, or penal Statutes. For except the Bani&s;hment of <HI>Protagoras,</HI> and the Death of <HI>Socrates,</HI> which la&s;t Event proceeded partly from other Motives, there are &s;carce any In&s;tances to be met with, in antient Hi&s;tory, of this bigotted Jea|lou&s;y and Per&s;ecution, with which the pre&s;ent Age is &s;o much infe&s;ted. <HI>Epicurus</HI> liv'd at <HI>Athens</HI> to an ad|vanc'd Age, in Peace and Tranquility: <HI>Epicureans</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luciani <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> were even admitted to receive the &s;acerdotal Charac|ter, and to officiate at the Altar, in the mo&s;t &s;acred Rites of their Religion: And the public Encourage|ment<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> of Pen&s;ions and Salaries was afforded equally, by the wi&s;e&s;t of all the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. &amp; Dio.</NOTE>, to the Profe&s;&s;ors of every Sect of Philo&s;ophy. How requi|&s;ite &s;uch kind of Treatment was to Philo&s;ophy, in its fir&s;t Origin, will ea&s;ily be conceiv'd, if we reflect, that even at pre&s;ent, when it may be &s;uppos'd more hardy and robu&s;t, it bears with much Difficulty the Inclemency of the Sea&s;ons, and tho&s;e har&s;h Winds of Calumny and Per&s;ecution, which blow upon it.</P>
<P>YOU admire, &s;ays my Friend, as the &s;ingular Good-Fortune of Philo&s;ophy, what &s;eems to re&s;ult from the natural Cour&s;e of things, and to be unavoidable in every Age and Nation. This pertinacious Bigotry, of which you complain, as &s;o fatal to Philo&s;ophy, is
<PB N="207" REF="201">
really her Offspring, who after allying with Super|&s;tition, &s;eparates him&s;elf intirely from the Intere&s;t of his Parent, and becomes her mo&s;t inveterate Enemy and Per&s;ecutor. Speculative Dogmas and Principles of Religion, the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ions of &s;uch furious Di&s;pute, could not po&s;&s;ibly be conceiv'd or admitted in the early Ages of the World; when Mankind, be|ing wholly illiterate, form'd an Idea of Religion, more &s;uitable to their weak Apprehen&s;ion, and com|pos'd their &s;acred Tenets chiefly of &s;uch Tales and Stories as were the Objects of traditional Belief, more than of Argument or Di&s;putation. After the fir&s;t Alarm, therefore, was over, which aro&s;e from the new Paradoxes and Principles of the Philo&s;ophers; they &s;eem, ever after, during the Ages of Antiquity, to have liv'd in great Harmony with the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Su|per&s;titions, and to have made a fair Partition of Man|kind betwixt them; the former claiming all the Learned and the Wi&s;e, and latter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the Vul|gar and Illiterate.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems then, &s;ays I, that you leave Politics en|tirely out of the Que&s;tion; and never &s;uppo&s;e, that a wi&s;e Magi&s;trate can ju&s;tly be jealous of certain Tenets of Philo&s;ophy, &s;uch as tho&s;e of <HI>Epicurus,</HI> which deny|ing a divine Exi&s;tence, and con&s;equently a Providence and a future State, &s;eem to loo&s;en, in a great Mea&s;ure,
<PB N="208" REF="202">
the Ties of Morality, and may be &s;uppos'd, for that Rea&s;on, pernicious to the Peace of civil Society.</P>
<P>I KNOW, reply'd he, that in Fact the&s;e Per&s;ecu|tions never, in any Age, proceeded from calm Rea|&s;on, or any Experience of the pernicious Con&s;equences of Philo&s;ophy; but aro&s;e entirely from Pa&s;&s;ion and Prejudice. But what if I &s;hould advance farther, and a&s;&s;ert, that if <HI>Epicurus</HI> had been accus'd before the People, by any of the <HI>Sycophants</HI> or Informers of tho&s;e Days, he could ea&s;ily have defended his Cau&s;e, and prov'd his Principles of Philo&s;ophy to be as &s;alutary as tho&s;e of his Adver&s;aries, who endeavour'd, with &s;uch Zeal, to &s;ubject him to the public Hatred and Jea|lou&s;y?</P>
<P>I WISH, &s;ays I, you would try your Eloquence upon &s;o extraordinary a Topic, and make a Speech for <HI>Epicu|rus,</HI> which might &s;atisfy, not the Mob of <HI>Athens,</HI> if you will allow that antient and polite City to have contain'd any Mob, but the more philo&s;ophical Part of his Audience, &s;uch as might be &s;uppos'd capable of comprehending his Arguments.</P>
<P>THE Matter would not be difficult, upon &s;uch Conditions, reply'd he: And if you plea&s;e, I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf <HI>Epicurus</HI> for a Moment, and make you &s;tand for the <HI>Athenian</HI> People, and &s;hall give you &s;uch

But &s;o far as in me lies, I will prevent this Abu&s;e. We &s;hall not here di&s;pute concerning the Origin and Government of Worlds. We &s;hall only enquire how far &s;uch Que|&s;tions concern the public Intere&s;t. And if I can per|&s;uade you, that they are entirely indifferent to the Peace of Society and Security of Government, I hope you will pre&s;ently &s;end us back to our Schools, there to examine at lei&s;ure the Que&s;tion the mo&s;t &s;ublime, but, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t &s;peculative, of all Philo&s;ophy.</P>

YOUR religious Philo&s;ophers, not &s;atisfy'd with the Tradition of your Forefathers, and Doctrines of your Prie&s;ts (in which I willingly acquie&s;ce) indulge a ra&s;h Curio&s;ity, in trying how far they can e&s;tabli&s;h Re|ligion upon the Principles of Rea&s;on; and they there|by <HI>excite,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;atisfying the Doubts, which na|turally ari&s;e from a diligent and &s;crutinous Enquiry.

I &s;hall not examine the Ju&s;tne&s;s of this Argument. I &s;hall allow it to be as &s;olid as my Antagoni&s;ts and Accu&s;ers can de&s;ire. 'Tis &s;ufficient, if I can prove, from this very Rea&s;oning, that the Que&s;tion is entirely &s;peculative, and that when, in my philo&s;ophical Di&s;qui&s;itions, I deny a Providence and a future State, I undermine not the Foundations of Society and Government, but advance Principles, which they them&s;elves, upon their own Topics, if they argue con&s;i&s;tently, mu&s;t allow to be &s;olid and &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>YOU then, who are my Accu&s;ers, have acknow|ledged, that the chief or &s;ole Argument for a divine Exi&s;tence (which I never que&s;tion'd) is deriv'd from the Order of Nature; where there appears &s;uch Marks
<PB N="211" REF="205">
of Intelligence and De&s;ign, that you think it extrava|gant to a&s;&s;ign for its Cau&s;e, either Chance, or the blind and unguided Force of Matter. You allow, that this is an Argument, drawn from Effects to Cau&s;es. You infer, from the Order of the Work, that there mu&s;t have been Project and Forethought in the Workman. If you cannot make out this Point, you allow, that your Conclu&s;ion fails; and you pretend not to e&s;tabli&s;h the Conclu&s;ion in a greater Latitude than the Phae|nomena of Nature will ju&s;tify. The&s;e are your Con|ce&s;&s;ions. I de&s;ire you to mark the Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>WHEN we infer any particular Cau&s;e from an Ef|fect, we mu&s;t proportion the one to the other, and can never be allow'd to a&s;cribe to the Cau&s;e any Qua|lities, but what are exactly &s;ufficient to produce the Effect. A Body of ten Ounces rais'd in any Scale may &s;erve as a Proof, that the counter-ballancing Weight exceeds ten Ounces; but can never afford a Rea&s;on, that it exceeds a hundred.

THE &s;ame Rule holds, whether the Cau&s;e a&s;&s;ign'd be brute uncon&s;cious Matter or a rational intelligent Be|ing.

Flattery to &s;upply the Defects of Argument and Rea|&s;oning. So far as the Traces of any Attributes, at pre&s;ent, appear, &s;o far may we conclude the&s;e Attri|butes to exi&s;t.

I acknowledge, that, in the pre&s;ent Order of Things, Virtue is attended with more Peace of Mind than Vice; and meets with a more favourable Reception from the World. I am &s;en&s;ible, that, according to the pa&s;t Experience of Mankind, Friend&s;hip is the chief Joy of human Life, and Moderation the only Source of Tranquillity and Happine&s;s. I never ba|lance betwixt the virtuous and the vicious Cour&s;e of Life; but am &s;en&s;ible, that, to a well-di&s;pos'd Mind, every Advantage is on the Side of the former: And what can you &s;ay more, allowing all your Suppo&s;i|tions and Rea&s;onings?

Experience of Events.

You &s;eem not to remember, that all your Rea&s;onings on this Subject can only be drawn from Effects to Cau&s;es; and that every Argument, deduc'd from Cau&s;es to Ef|fects, mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be a gro&s;s Sophy&s;m; &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible for you to know any thing of the Cau&s;e, but what you have antecedently, not infer'd, but di&s;co|ver'd to the full, in the Effect.</P>

THUS I bring the Di&s;pute, O <HI>Athenians,</HI> to a &s;hort I&s;&s;ue with my Antagoni&s;ts. The Cour&s;e of Nature lies open to my Contemplation as well as theirs. The experienc'd Train of Events is the great Standard, by which we all regulate our Conduct. Nothing el&s;e can be appeal'd to, in the Field, or in the Senate.

'Tis uncertain; becau&s;e the Subject lies entirely beyond the Reach of human Experience. 'Tis u&s;ele&s;s; becau&s;e our Know|ledge of this Cau&s;e being deriv'd entirely from the Cour&s;e of Nature, we can never, according to any Rules of ju&s;t Rea&s;oning, return back from the Cau&s;e with any new Inferences, or making Additions to the common and experienc'd Cour&s;e of Nature, e&s;tabli&s;h any new Principles of Conduct and Behaviour.</P>

my Favour, by embracing tho&s;e Principles, to which, you know, I have always expre&s;s'd a particular At|tachment. But allowing you to make Experience (as indeed I think you ought) the only Standard of your Judgment concerning this, and all other Que&s;tions of Fact; I doubt not but it may be po&s;&s;ible, from the very &s;ame Experience you appeal to, to refute this Rea&s;oning, which you have put into the Mouth of <HI>Epicurus.</HI> If you &s;aw, for In&s;tance, a half-fini&s;h'd Building, &s;urrounded with Heaps of Bricks and Stones and Mortar, and all the In&s;truments of Ma&s;onry; could you not <HI>infer</HI> from the Effect, that it was a Work of De&s;ign and Contrivance? And could you not return again, from this infer'd Cau&s;e, to infer new Additions to the Effect, and conclude, that the Build|ing would &s;oon be fini&s;h'd, and receive all the farther Improvements, which Art could be&s;tow upon it? If you &s;aw, upon the Sea-&s;hore, the Print of one human Foot, you would conclude, that a Man had pa&s;s'd that Way, and that he had al&s;o left the Traces of the other Foot, tho' effac'd by the rolling of the Sands or Inundation of the Waters. Why then do you refu&s;e to admit the &s;ame Method of Rea&s;oning with regard to the Order of Nature? Con&s;ider the World and the pre&s;ent Life only as an imperfect Building, from which you can infer a &s;uperior Intelligence; and arguing from that &s;uperior Intelligence, which can leave no|thing imperfect; why may you not infer a more fi|ni&s;h'd

Scheme or Plan, which will receive its Com|pletion in &s;ome di&s;tant Period of Space or Time? Are not the&s;e Methods of Rea&s;oning exactly parallel? And under what Pretext, can you embrace the one, while you reject the other?</P>
<P>THE infinite Difference of the Subjects, reply'd he, is a &s;ufficient Foundation for this Difference in my Arguments and Conclu&s;ions. In Works of <HI>human</HI> Art and Contrivance, 'tis allowable to advance from the Effect, to the Cau&s;e, and returning back from the Cau&s;e, form new Inferences concerning the Effect, and examine the Alterations, which it has probably undergone, or may &s;till undergo. But what is the Foundation of this Method of Rea&s;oning? Plainly this; that Man is a Being, whom we know by Expe|rience, who&s;e Motives and De&s;igns we are acquainted with, and who&s;e Projects and Inclinations have a cer|tain Connexion and Coherence, according to the Laws, which Nature has e&s;tabli&s;h'd for the Government of &s;uch a Creature. When, therefore, we find, that any Work has proceeded from the Skill and Indu&s;try of Man; as we are otherwi&s;e acquainted with the Nature of the Animal; we can draw a hundred Infe|rences concerning what may be expected from him; and the&s;e Inferences will all be founded on Experience and Ob&s;ervation. But did we know Man only from the &s;ingle Work or Production, which we examine,
<PB N="223" REF="217">
'twere impo&s;&s;ible for us to argue in this Manner; be|cau&s;e our Knowledge of all the Qualities, which we a&s;cribe to him, being in that Ca&s;e deriv'd from the Production, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they could point to any thing farther, or be the Foundation of any new Infe|rences. The Print of a Foot in the Sand can only prove, when con&s;ider'd alone, that there was &s;ome Pigure adapted to it, by which it was produc'd: But the Print of a human Foot proves likewi&s;e, from our other Experience, that there was probably another Foot, which al&s;o left its Impre&s;&s;ion, tho' e&s;&s;ac'd by Time or other Accidents. Here we mount from the Effect to the Cau&s;e; and de&s;cending again from the Cau&s;e, infer Alterations in the Effect; but this is not a Continuation of the &s;ame &s;imple Chain of Rea&s;oning. We comprehend in this Ca&s;e a hundred other Experiences and Ob&s;ervations, concerning the <HI>u&s;ual</HI> Figure and Members of that Species of Ani|mal, without which this Method of Argument mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd as altogether fallacious and &s;ophi&s;tical.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;e is not the &s;ame with our Rea&s;onings from the Works of Nature. The Deity is known to us only by his Productions, and is a &s;ingle Being in the Univer&s;e, not comprehended under any Species or Genus, from who&s;e experienc'd Attributes or Qua|lities, we can by Analogy, infer any Attribute or Qua|lity in him. As the Univer&s;e &s;hows Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, we infer Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s: As it
<PB N="224" REF="218">
&s;hows a particular Degree of the&s;e Perfections, we infer a particular Degree of them, preci&s;ely adapted to the Effect we examine. But farther Attributes or farther Degrees of the &s;ame Attributes, we can never be authoriz'd to infer or &s;uppo&s;e, by any Rules of ju&s;t Rea&s;oning. Now without &s;ome &s;uch Licence of Sup|po&s;ition, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for us to argue from the Cau&s;e, or infer any Alteration in the Effect, beyond what has immediately fallen under our Ob&s;ervation. Greater Good produc'd by this Being mu&s;t &s;till prove a greater Degree of Goodne&s;s: More impartial Di&s;tribution of Rewards and Puni&s;hments mu&s;t proceed from a &s;upe|rior Regard to Ju&s;tice and Equity. Every &s;uppos'd Addition to the Works of Nature makes an Addition to the Attributes of the Author of Nature; and con|&s;equently, being altogether un&s;upported by any Rea|&s;on or Argument, can never be admitted but as mere Conjecture and Hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>IN general, it may, I think, be e&s;tabli&s;h'd as a Maxim, that where any Cau&s;e is known only by its particular Effects, it mu&s;t be impo&s;&s;ible to infer any new Effects from that Cau&s;e; &s;ince the Qualities, which are requi&s;ite to produce the&s;e new Effects, along with the former, mu&s;t either be different, or &s;uperior, or of more exten&s;ive Operation, than tho&s;e which &s;imply produc'd the Effect, whence alone the Cau&s;e

is &s;uppos'd to be known to us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To &s;ay that the new Effects proceed only from a Continu|ation of the &s;ame Energy, which is already known from the fir&s;t Effects, will not remove the Difficulty. For even granting this to be the Ca&s;e, (which can &s;eldom be &s;uppos'd) the very Continuation and Exertion of a like Energy (for 'tis impo&s;&s;ible it can be ab&s;olutely the &s;ame) I &s;ay, this Exertion of a like Energy in a different Period of Space and Time is a very arbitrary Suppo&s;ition, and what there cannot po&s;&s;ibly be any Traces of in the Effects, from which all our Knowledge of the Cau&s;e is originally deriv'd. Let the <HI>infer'd</HI> Cau&s;e be exactly proportion'd (as it &s;hould be) to the known Ef|fect; and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible it can po&s;&s;e&s;s any Qualities, from which new or different Effects can be <HI>infer'd.</HI></NOTE>. We can never, therefore, have any Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e the Exi&s;tence of the&s;e Qualities.</P>
<P>THE great Source of our Mi&s;take in this Subject, and of the unbounded Licence of Conjecture, which we indulge, is, that we tacitly con&s;ider our&s;elves, as in the Place of the &s;upreme Being, and conclude, that he will, on every Occa&s;ion, ob&s;erve the &s;ame Conduct, which we our&s;elves, in his Situation, would have em|brac'd as rea&s;onable and eligible. But be&s;ides, that the ordinary Cour&s;e of Nature may convince us, that almo&s;t every Thing is regulated by Principles and Maxims very different from ours; be&s;ides this, I &s;ay, it mu&s;t evidently appear contrary to all Rules of Ana|logy to rea&s;on from the Intentions and Projects of

Men to tho&s;e of a Being &s;o different, and &s;o much &s;u|perior.

But this Method of Rea&s;oning never can take place with regard to a Being, &s;o remote and incomprehen&s;ible, who bears le&s;s Ana|logy to any other Being in the Univer&s;e than the Sun to a waxen Taper, and who di&s;covers him&s;elf only by &s;ome faint Traces or Outlines, beyond which we have no Authority to a&s;cribe to him any Attribute or Per|fection. What we imagine to be a &s;uperior Perfec|tion may really be a Defect. Or were it ever &s;o much a Perfection, the a&s;cribing it to the &s;upreme Being, where it appears not to have been really exerted, to the full, in his Works, &s;avours more of Flattery and Panegyric, than of ju&s;t Rea&s;oning and &s;ound Philo&s;o|phy.

There is no Enthu&s;ia&s;m among Philo&s;ophers; their Doctrines are not very alluring to the People; and no Re&s;traint can be put upon their Rea&s;onings, but what mu&s;t be of dangerous Con&s;e|quence to the Sciences, and even to the State, by paving the Way for Per&s;ecution and Oppre&s;&s;ion in Points, wherein the Generality of Mankind are more deeply intere&s;ted and concern'd.</P>
<P>BUT there occurs to me, (continu'd I) with regard to your main Topic a Difficulty, which I &s;hall ju&s;t propo&s;e to you, without in&s;i&s;ting on it, le&s;t it lead into Rea&s;onings of too nice and delicate a Nature. In a Word, I much doubt, whether it be po&s;&s;ible for a Cau&s;e to be known only by its Effect (as you have all along &s;uppos'd) or to be of &s;o &s;ingular and particular a Nature as to have no Parallel and no Similarity with any other Cau&s;e or Object, that has ever fallen under our Ob&s;ervation. 'Tis only when two <HI>Species</HI> of Ob|jects are found to be con&s;tantly conjoin'd, that we can infer the one from the other; and were an Effect pre&s;ented, which was entirely &s;ingular, and could not
<PB N="229" REF="223">
be comprehended under any known <HI>Species</HI>; I do not &s;ee, that we could form any Conjecture or Inference at all concerning its Cau&s;e. If Experience and Ob|&s;ervation and Analogy be, indeed, the only Guides we can rea&s;onably follow in Inferences of this Nature; both the Effect and Cau&s;e mu&s;t bear a Similarity and Re&s;emblance to other Effects and Cau&s;es, which we know, and which we have found, in many In&s;tances, to be conjoin'd with each other. I leave it to your own Reflections to pro&s;ecute the Con&s;equences of this Principle. I &s;hall ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that as the Antago|ni&s;ts of <HI>Epicurus</HI> always &s;uppo&s;e the Univer&s;e, an Ef|fect quite &s;ingular and unparallel'd, to be the Proof of a Deity, a Cau&s;e no le&s;s &s;ingular and unparallel'd; your Rea&s;onings, upon that Suppo&s;ition, &s;eem, at lea&s;t, to merit our Attention. There is, I own, &s;ome Dif|ficulty, how we can ever return from the Cau&s;e to the Effect, and rea&s;oning from our Ideas of the former, infer any Alteration on, or Addition to, the latter.</P>

<P>THERE is not a greater Number of philo&s;o|phical Rea&s;onings, di&s;play'd upon any Subject, than tho&s;e to prove the Exi&s;tence of a Deity, and re|fute the Fallacies of <HI>Athei&s;ts</HI>; and yet the mo&s;t reli|gious Philo&s;ophers &s;till di&s;pute whether any Man can be &s;o blinded as to be a &s;peculative Athei&s;t. How &s;hall we reconcile the&s;e Contradictions? The Knight-Errants, who wander'd about to clear the World of Dragons and Giants, never entertain'd the lea&s;t Doubt concerning the Exi&s;tence of the&s;e Mon&s;ters.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sceptic</HI> is another Enemy of Religion, who naturally provokes the Indignation of all Divines and
<PB N="232" REF="225">
graver Philo&s;ophers; tho' 'tis certain no one ever met with any &s;uch ab&s;urd Creature, or convers'd with a Man, who had no Opinion or Principle concerning any Subject, either of Action or Speculation. This begets a very natural Que&s;tion; What is meant by a Sceptic? And how far it is po&s;&s;ible to pu&s;h the&s;e phi|lo&s;ophical Principles of Doubt and Uncertainty?</P>
<P>THERE is a Species of Sceptici&s;m, <HI>antecedent</HI> to all Study and Philo&s;ophy, which is much inculcated by <HI>Des Cartes</HI> and others, as a &s;overeign Pre&s;ervative a|gain&s;t Error and precipitate Judgment. It recom|mends an univer&s;al Doubt, not only of all our former Opinions and Principles, but al&s;o of our very Facul|ties; of who&s;e Veracity, &s;ay they, we mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, by a Chain of Rea&s;oning, deduc'd from &s;ome original Principle, which cannot po&s;&s;ibly be fal|lacious or deceitful. But neither is there any &s;uch o|riginal Principle, which has a Prerogative above others, that are &s;elf-evident and convincing: Or if there were, could we advance a Step beyond it, but by the U&s;e of tho&s;e very Faculties, of which we are &s;uppos'd to be already diffident. The <HI>Carte&s;ian</HI> Doubt, therefore, were it ever po&s;&s;ible, to be attain'd by any human Creature (as it plainly is not) would be altogether in|curable; and no Rea&s;oning could ever bring us to a State of A&s;&s;urance and Conviction upon any Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="226">
IT mu&s;t, however, be confe&s;s'd, that this Species of Sceptici&s;m, when more moderate, may be under|&s;tood in a very rea&s;onable Sen&s;e, and is a nece&s;&s;ary Preparative to the Study of Philo&s;ophy, by pre&s;erving a proper Impartiality in our Judgments, and weaning our Minds from all tho&s;e Prejudices, which we may have imbib'd from Education or ra&s;h Opinion. To begin with clear and &s;elf-evident Principles, to ad|vance by timorous and &s;ure Steps, to review frequently our Conclu&s;ions, and examine accurately all their Con&s;equences; tho' by this Means we &s;hall make both a &s;low and a &s;hort Progre&s;s in our Sy&s;tems; is the only Method, by which we can ever hope to reach Truth, and attain a proper Stability and Certainty in our Determinations.</P>
<P>THERE is another Species of Sceptici&s;m, <HI>con&s;equent</HI> to Science and Enquiry; where Men are &s;uppos'd to have di&s;cover'd, either the ab&s;olute Fallaciou&s;ne&s;s of their Mental Faculties, or their Unfitne&s;s to reach any fix'd Determination in all tho&s;e curious Subjects of Speculation, about which they are commonly em|ploy'd. Even our very Sen&s;es are brought into Di&s;|pute by this Species of Philo&s;ophers; and the Maxims of common Life are &s;ubjected to the &s;ame Doubt as the mo&s;t profound Principles or Conclu&s;ions of Meta|phy&s;ics and Theology. As the&s;e paradoxical Tenets (if they may be call'd &s;o) are to be met with in &s;ome
<PB N="234" REF="227">
Philo&s;ophers, and the Refutation of them in &s;everal, they naturally excite our Curio&s;ity, and make us en|quire into the Arguments, on which they may be founded.</P>
<P>I NEED not in&s;i&s;t upon the more trite Topics, em|ploy'd by the Sceptics in all Ages, again&s;t the Evi|dence of <HI>Sen&s;e</HI>; &s;uch as tho&s;e deriv'd from the Im|perfection and Fallaciou&s;ne&s;s of our Organs, on num|berle&s;s Occa&s;ions; the crooked Appearance of an Oar in Water; the various A&s;pects of Objects, according to their different Di&s;tances; the double Images, that ari&s;e from the pre&s;&s;ing one Eye with the Finger; with many other Appearances of a like Nature. The&s;e &s;ceptical Topics, indeed, are only &s;ufficient to prove, that the Sen&s;es alone are not implicitely to be de|pended on; but that we mu&s;t correct their Evidence by Rea&s;on, and by Con&s;iderations, deriv'd from the Nature of the Medium, the Di&s;tance of the Object, and the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Organ, in order to render them, within their Sphere, the proper <HI>Criteria</HI> of Truth and Fal&s;hood. There are other more pro|found Arguments again&s;t the Sen&s;es, which admit not of &s;o ea&s;y a Solution.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems evident, that Men are carry'd, by a na|tural In&s;tinct or Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to repo&s;e Faith in their Sen&s;es; and that, without any Rea&s;oning, or even al|mo&s;t
<PB N="235" REF="228">
before the U&s;e of Rea&s;on, we always &s;uppo&s;e an external Univer&s;e, which depends not on our Percep|tion, but would exi&s;t, tho' we and every &s;en&s;ible Crea|ture were ab&s;ent or annihilated. Even the Animal Creation are govern'd by a like Opinion, and pre&s;erve this Belief of external Objects, in all their Thoughts, De&s;igns, and Actions.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems al&s;o evident, that when Men follow this blind and powerful In&s;tinct of Nature, they always &s;up|po&s;e the very Images, pre&s;ented by the Sen&s;es, to be the external Objects, and never entertain any Su&s;pi|cion, that the one are nothing but Repre&s;entations of the other. This very Table, which we &s;ee white, and which we feel hard, is believ'd to exi&s;t, indepen|dent of our Perception, and to be &s;omething external to our Mind, which perceives it. Our Pre&s;ence be|&s;tows not Being on it: Our Ab&s;ence annihilates it not. It pre&s;erves its Exi&s;tence, uniform and entire, inde|pendent of the Situation of intelligent Beings, who perceive or contemplate it.</P>
<P>BUT this univer&s;al and primary Opinion of all Men is &s;oon de&s;troy'd by the &s;lighte&s;t Philo&s;ophy, which teaches us, that nothing can ever be pre&s;ent to the Mind but an Image or Perception, and that the Sen&s;es are only the Inlets, thro' which the&s;e Images are receiv'd, without being ever able to produce any immediate In|tercour&s;e
<PB N="236" REF="229">
betwixt the Mind and the Object. The Table we &s;ee &s;eems to dimini&s;h as we remove farther from it: But the real Table, which exi&s;ts, indepen|dent of us, &s;uffers no Alteration: It was, therefore, nothing but its Image, which was pre&s;ent to the Mind. The&s;e are the obvious Dictates of Rea&s;on; and no Man, who reflects, ever doubted, that the Exi&s;tences, which we con&s;ider, when we &s;ay, <HI>this Hou&s;e</HI> and <HI>that Tree,</HI> are nothing but Perceptions in the Mind, and fleeting Copies or Repre&s;entations of other Exi&s;tences, which remain uniform and independent.</P>
<P>SO far, then, are we nece&s;&s;itated by Rea&s;oning to depart from, or contradict the primary In&s;tincts of Nature, and embrace a new Sy&s;tem with regard to the Evidence of our Sen&s;es. But here Philo&s;ophy finds it&s;elf extremely embarra&s;s'd, when it would ju&s;tify this new Sy&s;tem, and obviate the Cavils and Objec|tions of the Sceptics. It can no longer plead the in|fallible and irre&s;i&s;tible In&s;tinct of Nature: For that led us to a quite different Sy&s;tem, which is acknow|ledg'd fallible and even erroneous. And to ju&s;tify this pretended philo&s;ophical Sy&s;tem, by a Chain of clear and convincing Argument, or even any Appear|ance of Argument, exceeds the Power of all human Capacity.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="230">
BY what Argument can it be prov'd, that the Per|ceptions of the Mind mu&s;t be caus'd by external Ob|jects, entirely different from, tho' re&s;embling them (if that be po&s;&s;ible) and could not ari&s;e either from the Energy of the Mind it&s;elf, or from the Sugge&s;tion of &s;ome invi&s;ible and unknown Spirit, or from &s;ome other Cau&s;e &s;till more unknown to us? 'Tis acknow|ledg'd, that, in fact, many of the&s;e Perceptions ari&s;e not from any thing external, as in Dreams, Madne&s;s, and other Di&s;ea&s;es. And nothing can be more inex|plicable than the Manner, in which Body &s;hould &s;o operate upon Mind as ever to convey an Image of it|&s;elf to a Sub&s;tance &s;uppos'd of &s;o different, and even contrary a Nature.</P>
<P>'TIS a Que&s;tion of Fact, whether the Perceptions of the Sen&s;es be produc'd by external Objects, re|&s;embling them: How &s;hall this Que&s;tion be deter|min'd? By Experience &s;urely, as all other Que&s;tions of a like Nature. But here Experience is, and mu&s;t be entirely &s;ilent. The Mind has never any thing pre&s;ent to it but the Perceptions, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly reach any Experience of their Connexion with Objects. The Suppo&s;ition of &s;uch a Connexion is, therefore, without any Foundation in Rea&s;oning.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="231">
To have recour&s;e to the Veracity of the &s;upreme Being, in order to prove the Veracity of our Sen&s;es, is &s;urely making a very unexpected Circuit. If his Veracity were at all concern'd in this Matter, our Sen&s;es would be entirely infallible; becau&s;e it is not po&s;&s;ible he can ever deceive. Not to mention, that if the external World be once call'd in doubt, we &s;hall be at a lo&s;s to find Arguments, by which we may prove the Exi&s;tence of that Being or any of his Attri|butes.</P>
<P>This therefore is a Topic, in which the profounder and more philo&s;ophical Sceptics will always triumph, when they endeavour to introduce an univer&s;al Doubt into all Subjects of human Knowledge and Enquiry. Do you follow the In&s;tincts and Propen&s;ities of Nature, may they &s;ay, in a&s;&s;enting to the Veracity of Sen&s;e? But the&s;e lead you to believe, that the very Percep|tion or &s;en&s;ible Image is the external Object. Do you di&s;claim this, in order to embrace a more rational Principle, that the Perceptions are only Repre&s;enta|tions of &s;omething external? You here depart from your natural Propen&s;ities and more obvious Senti|ments; and yet are not able to &s;atisfy your Rea&s;on, which can never find any convincing Argument from Experience to prove, that the Perceptions are con|nected with any external Objects.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="232">
THERE is another Sceptical Topic of a like Na|ture, deriv'd from the mo&s;t profound Philo&s;ophy; which might merit our Attention were it requi&s;ite to dive &s;o deep, in order to di&s;cover Arguments and Rea&s;onings, that can &s;erve &s;o little any &s;erious Purpo&s;e or Intention. 'Tis univer&s;ally allow'd by modern Enquirers, that all the &s;en&s;ible Qualities of Objects, &s;uch as hard, &s;oft, hot, cold, white, black, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are merely &s;econdary, and exi&s;t not in the Objects them|&s;elves, but are Perceptions in the Mind, without any external Archetype or Model, which they repre&s;ent. If this be allow'd, with regard to &s;econdary Qualities, it mu&s;t al&s;o follow with regard to the &s;uppos'd pri|mary Qualities of Exten&s;ion and Solidity; nor can the latter be any more entitled to that Denomination than the former. The Idea of Exten&s;ion is entirely ac|quir'd from the Sen&s;es of Sight and Feeling; and if all the Qualities, perceiv'd by the Sen&s;es, be in the Mind, not in the Object, the &s;ame Conclu&s;ion mu&s;t reach the Idea of Exten&s;ion, which is wholly depen|dent on the &s;en&s;ible Ideas or the Ideas of &s;econdary Qualities. Nothing can &s;ave us from this Conclu&s;ion, but the a&s;&s;erting, that the Ideas of tho&s;e primary Qua|lities are attain'd by <HI>Ab&s;traction</HI>; which, if we ex|amine accurately, we &s;hall find to be unintelligible, and even ab&s;urd. An Exten&s;ion, that is neither tan|gible nor vi&s;ible, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be conceiv'd: and a tangible or vi&s;ible Exten&s;ion, which is neither hard
<PB N="240" REF="233">
nor &s;oft, black nor white, is equally beyond the Reach of human Conception. Let any Man try to conceive a Triangle in general, which is neither <HI>I&s;o|celes,</HI> nor <HI>Scalenum,</HI> nor has any particular Length nor Proportion of Sides; and he will &s;oon perceive the Ab&s;urdity of all the &s;chola&s;tic Notions with regard to Ab&s;traction and general Ideas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Argument is drawn from Dr. <HI>Berkeley</HI>; and indeed mo&s;t of the Writings of that ingenious Author form the be&s;t Le&s;&s;ons of Sceptici&s;m, which are to be found either among the antient or modern Philo&s;ophers, <HI>Bayle</HI> not excepted.

Thus when the Term, Hor&s;e, is pronounc'd, we im|mediately figure to our&s;elves the Idea of a black or a white Animal of a particular Size or Figure: But as that Term is al&s;o us'd to be apply'd to Animals of other Figures and Sizes, the&s;e Ideas, tho' not actually pre&s;ent to the Imagination, are ea&s;ily recall'd, and our Rea&s;oning and Conclu&s;ion proceed in the &s;ame Way, as if they were actually pre&s;ent. If this be admitted (as &s;eems rea&s;onable) it follows that all the Ideas of Quantity, upon which Mathema|ticians rea&s;on, are nothing but particular, and &s;uch as are &s;ug|ge&s;ted by the Sen&s;es and Imagination, and con&s;equently, cannot be infinitely divi&s;ible. In general, we may pronounce, that the Ideas of <HI>greater, le&s;s,</HI> or <HI>equal,</HI> which are the chief Objects of Geometry, are far from being &s;o exact or determinate as to be the Foundation of &s;uch extraordinary Inferences.

and Sentiments; with many other Topics of that Kind. 'Tis needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t farther on this Head. The&s;e Objections are but weak. For as in common Life, we rea&s;on every Moment concerning Fact and Exi&s;tence, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t, with|out continually employing this Species of Argument, any popular Objections, deriv'd from thence, mu&s;t be in&s;ufficient to de&s;troy that Evidence. The great Subverter of <HI>Pyrrhoni&s;m</HI> or the exce&s;&s;ive Principles of Sceptici&s;m, is Action, and Employment, and the Oc|cupations of common Life. They may flouri&s;h and triumph in the Schools; where it is, indeed, difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible to refute them. But as &s;oon as they leave the Shade, and by the Pre&s;ence of the real Ob|jects, which actuate our Pa&s;&s;ions and Sentiments, are put in Oppo&s;ition to the more powerful Principles of our Nature, they vani&s;h, like Smoak, and leave the mo&s;t determin'd Sceptic in the &s;ame Condition as other Mortals.</P>
<P>THE Sceptic, therefore, had better keep in his proper Sphere, and di&s;play tho&s;e <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> Objec|tions, which ari&s;e from more profound Re&s;earches. Here he &s;eems to have ample Matter of Triumph; while he ju&s;tly in&s;i&s;ts, that all our Evidence for any Matter of Fact, which lies beyond the Te&s;timony of Sen&s;e or Memory, is deriv'd entirely from the Rela|tion of Cau&s;e and Effect; that we have no other Idea
<PB N="247" REF="240">
of this Relation than that of two Objects, which have been frequently <HI>conjoin'd</HI> together; that we have no Arguments to convince us, that Objects, which have, in our Experience, been frequently conjoin'd, will likewi&s;e, in other In&s;tances, be conjoin'd in the &s;ame Manner; and that nothing leads us to this Inference but Cu&s;tom or a certain In&s;tinct of our Nature, which 'tis indeed difficult to re&s;i&s;t; but which, like other In&s;tincts, may al&s;o be fallacious and deceitful. While the Sceptic in&s;i&s;ts upon the&s;e Topics, he &s;hows his Force, or rather, indeed, his own and our Weakne&s;s; and &s;eems, for the Time, at lea&s;t, to de&s;troy all A&s;&s;ur|ance and Conviction. The&s;e Arguments might be di&s;|play'd at a greater Length, if any durable Good or Benefit to Society could ever be expected to re&s;ult from them.</P>
<P>FOR here is the chief and mo&s;t confounding Ob|jection to <HI>exce&s;&s;ive</HI> Sceptici&s;m, that no durable Good can ever re&s;ult from it; while it remains in its full Force and Vigour. We need only a&s;k &s;uch a Sceptic, <HI>What his Meaning is? And what he propo&s;es by all the&s;e curious Re&s;earches?</HI> He is immediately at a &s;tand, and knows not what to an&s;wer. A <HI>Copernican</HI> or <HI>Ptolemaic,</HI> who &s;upports, each his different Sy&s;tem of A&s;tronomy, may hope to produce a Conviction, which will remain, con&s;tant and durable, with his Audience.
<PB N="248" REF="241">
A <HI>Stoic</HI> or <HI>Epicurean</HI> di&s;plays Principles, which may not only be durable, but which have a mighty Effect on Conduct and Behaviour. But a <HI>Pyrrhonian</HI> cannot propo&s;e, that his Philo&s;ophy will have any con&s;tant Influence on the Mind: Or if it had, that its Influ|ence would be beneficial to Society. On the contrary, he mu&s;t acknowledge, if he will acknowledge any thing, that all human Life mu&s;t immediately peri&s;h, were his Principles univer&s;ally and &s;teadily to prevail. All Di&s;cour&s;e, all Action mu&s;t immediately cea&s;e; and Men remain in a total Lethargy, till the Nece&s;|&s;ities of Nature, un&s;atisfy'd, put an end to their mi|&s;erable Exi&s;tence. 'Tis true; &s;o fatal an Event is very little to be dreaded. Nature is always too &s;trong for Principle. And tho' a <HI>Pyrrhonian</HI> may throw him&s;elf or others into a momentary Amazement and Confu&s;ion by his profound Rea&s;onings; the fir&s;t and mo&s;t trivial Event in Life will immediately put to flight all his Doubts and Scruples, and leave him the &s;ame, in every Point of Action and Speculation, with the Philo&s;ophers of every other Sect, or with tho&s;e who never concern'd them&s;elves with any philo&s;ophical Re&s;earches. When he awakes from his Dream, he will be the fir&s;t to join in the Laugh again&s;t him&s;elf, and to confe&s;s, that all his Objections are mere Amu&s;e|ments, and can have no other Tendency than to &s;how us the whim&s;ical Condition of Mankind, who mu&s;t
<PB N="249" REF="242">
act and rea&s;on and believe; tho' they are not able, by their mo&s;t diligent Enquiry, to &s;atisfy them&s;elves concerning the Foundation of the&s;e Operations, or to remove the Objections that may be rais'd again&s;t them.</P>

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is, indeed, a more <HI>mitigated</HI> Sceptici&s;m or <HI>academical</HI> Philo&s;ophy, which may be both durable and u&s;eful, and which may, in Part, be the Re&s;ult of this <HI>Pyrrhoni&s;m,</HI> or <HI>exce&s;&s;ive</HI> Sceptici&s;m, when its un|di&s;tingui&s;h'd Doubts are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, corrected by common Sen&s;e and Reflection. The greate&s;t Part of Mankind are naturally apt to be affirmative and dog|matical in their Opinions; and while they &s;ee Objects only on one Side, and have no Idea of any counter|balancing Arguments, they throw them&s;elves precipi|tately into the Principles, which they are inclin'd to; nor have they any Indulgence for tho&s;e who entertain oppo&s;ite Sentiments. To he&s;itate or balance per|plexes their Under&s;tanding, checks their Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;u&s;pends their Actions. They are, therefore, im|patient till they get out of a State of Mind, which to them is &s;o unea&s;y; and they think they can never re|move them&s;elves far enough from it, by the Violence
<PB N="250" REF="243">
of their Affirmations and Ob&s;tinacy of their Belief. But could &s;uch dogmatical Rea&s;oners become &s;en&s;ible of the &s;trange Infirmities of human Under&s;tanding, even in its mo&s;t perfect State, and when mo&s;t exact and cautious in its Determinations; &s;uch a Reflection would naturally in&s;pire them with more Mode&s;ty and Re&s;erve, and dimini&s;h their fond Opinion of them|&s;elves, and their Prejudice again&s;t Antagoni&s;ts. The Illiterate may reflect on the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Learned, who, amid&s;t all the Advantages of Study and Reflec|tion, are commonly &s;till mode&s;t and re&s;erv'd in their Determinations: And if any of the Learned are in|clin'd, from their natural Temper, to Haughtine&s;s and Ob&s;tinacy, a &s;mall Tincture of <HI>Pyrrhoni&s;m</HI> may abate their Pride, by &s;howing them, that the few Advantages, which they may have attain'd over their Fellows, are but incon&s;iderable, if compar'd with the univer&s;al Perplexity and Confu&s;ion, which is inherent in human Nature. In general, there is a Degree of Doubt, and Caution, and Mode&s;ty, which, in all kinds of Scrutiny and Deci&s;ion, ought for ever to ac|company a ju&s;t Rea&s;oner.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Species of <HI>mitigated</HI> Sceptici&s;m, which may be of Advantage to Mankind, and which may be the natural Re&s;ult of the <HI>Pyrrhonian</HI> Doubts and Scruples, is the Limitation of our Enquiries to &s;uch
<PB N="251" REF="244">
Subjects as are be&s;t adapted to the narrow Capacity of human Under&s;tanding. The <HI>Imagination</HI> of Man is naturally &s;ublime, delighted with whatever is remote and extraordinary, and running, without Controul, into the mo&s;t di&s;tant Parts of Space and Time, to avoid the Objects, which Cu&s;tom has render'd too familiar to it. A correct <HI>Judgment</HI> ob&s;erves a contrary Me|thod; and avoiding all di&s;tant and high Enquiries, confines it&s;elf to common Life, and to &s;uch Subjects as fall under daily Practice and Experience; leaving the more &s;ublime Topics to the Embelli&s;hment of Poets and Orators, or the Arts of Prie&s;ts and Politi|cians. To bring us to &s;o &s;alutary a Determination, nothing can be more &s;erviceable, than to be once thoroughly convinc'd of the Force of the <HI>Pyrrhonian</HI> Doubt, and of the Impo&s;&s;ibility of any Thing, but the &s;trong Power of natural In&s;tinct, to free us from it. Tho&s;e, who have a Propen&s;ity to Philo&s;ophy, will &s;till continue their Re&s;earches; becau&s;e they re|flect, that, be&s;ide the immediate Plea&s;ure, attending &s;uch an Occupation, philo&s;ophical Deci&s;ions are no|thing but the Reflections of common Life, metho|diz'd and corrected. But they will never be tempted to go beyond common Life, &s;o long as they con&s;ider the Imperfection of tho&s;e Faculties they employ, their narrow Reach, and their inaccurate Operations. While we cannot give a &s;atisfactory Rea&s;on, why
<PB N="252" REF="245">
we believe, after a thou&s;and Experiments, that a Stone will fall, or Fire burn; can we ever &s;atisfy our&s;elves concerning any Determinations we may form with regard to the Origin of Worlds, and the Situation of Nature, from, and to Eternity?</P>
<P>THIS narrow Limitation, indeed, of our Enquiries, is, in every Re&s;pect, &s;o rea&s;onable, that it &s;uffices to make the &s;lighte&s;t Examination of the natural Powers of the human Mind, and compare them to their Ob|jects, in order to recommend it to us. We &s;hall then find what are the proper Subjects of Science and En|quiry.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems to me, that the only Object of the ab|&s;tract Sciences or of Demon&s;tration is Quantity and Number, and that all Attempts to extend this more perfect Species of Knowledge beyond the&s;e Bounds are mere Sophi&s;try and Illu&s;ion. As the component Parts of Quantity and Number are entirely &s;imilar, their Relations become intricate and involv'd; and nothing can be more curious, as well as u&s;eful, than to trace, by a Variety of Mediums, their Equality or Inequality, thro' their different Appearances. But as all other Ideas are clearly di&s;tinct and different from each other, we can never advance farther, by all our Scrutiny, than to ob&s;erve this Diver&s;ity, and, by an
<PB N="253" REF="246">
obvious Reflection, pronounce one Thing not to be another. Or if there be any Difficulty in the&s;e De|ci&s;ions, it proceeds entirely from the undetermin'd Meaning of Words, which is corrected by ju&s;ter De|finitions. That <HI>the Square of the Hypotenu&s;e is equal to the Squares of the other two Sides,</HI> cannot be known, let the Terms be ever &s;o exactly defin'd, without a Train of Rea&s;oning and Enquiry. But to convince us of the Truth of this Propo&s;ition, <HI>that where there is no Property, there can be no Inju&s;tice,</HI> 'tis only nece&s;|&s;ary to define the Terms, and explain Inju&s;tice to be a Violation of Property. This Propo&s;ition is, indeed, nothing but a more imperfect Definition. 'Tis the &s;ame Ca&s;e with all tho&s;e pretended &s;yllogi&s;tical Rea|&s;onings, which may be found in every other Branch of Learning, except the Sciences of Quantity and Number; and the&s;e may &s;afely, I think, be pro|nounc'd the only proper Objects of Knowledge and Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>ALL other Enquiries of Men regard only Matter of Fact and Exi&s;tence; and the&s;e are evidently incapable of Demon&s;tration. Whatever <HI>is may not be.</HI> No Negation of a Fact can involve a Contradiction. The Non-exi&s;tence of any Being, without Exception, is as clear and di&s;tinct an Idea as its Exi&s;tence. The Propo&s;ition, which affirms it not to be, is no le&s;s con|ceivable
<PB N="254" REF="247">
and intelligible, than that which affirms it to be. The Ca&s;e is different with the Sciences, pro|perly &s;o call'd. Every fal&s;e Propo&s;ition is there con|fus'd and unintelligible. That the Cube Root of 64 is equal to the half of 10, is a fal&s;e Propo&s;ition, and can never be di&s;tinctly conceiv'd. But that <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> or the Angel <HI>Gabriel,</HI> or any Being never exi&s;ted, may be a fal&s;e Propo&s;ition, but &s;till is perfectly con|ceivable, and implies no Contradiction.</P>
<P>THE Exi&s;tence, therefore, of any Being can only be prov'd by Arguments from its Cau&s;e or its Effect; and the&s;e Arguments are founded entirely on Expe|rience. If we rea&s;on <HI>a priori,</HI> any Thing may ap|pear able to produce any Thing. The Falling of a Peeble may, for aught we know, extingui&s;h the Sun; or the Wi&s;h of a Man controul the Planets in their Orbits. 'Tis only Experience, that teaches us the Nature and Bounds of Cau&s;e and Effect, and enables us to infer the Exi&s;tence of one Object from that of another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That impious Maxim of the antient Philo&s;ophy, <HI>Ex nihilo, nihil fit,</HI> by which the Creation of Matter was excluded, cea&s;es to be a Maxim, according to this Philo&s;ophy. Not only the Will of the &s;upreme Being may create Matter; but, for aught we can know <HI>a priori,</HI> the Will of any other Being might create it, or any other Cau&s;e, that the mo&s;t whim&s;ical Imagination can a&s;&s;ign.</NOTE>. Such is the Foundation of moral Rea&s;on|ing, which forms the greate&s;t Part of human Know|ledge,
<PB N="255" REF="248">
and is the Source of all human Action and Behaviour.</P>
<P>MORAL Rea&s;onings are either concerning particu|lar or general Facts. All Deliberations in Life regard the former; as al&s;o all Di&s;qui&s;itions in Hi&s;tory, Chro|nology, Geography, and A&s;tronomy.</P>
<P>THE Sciences, which treat of general Facts, are Politics, natural Philo&s;ophy, Phy&s;ic, Chymi&s;try, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where the Qualities, Cau&s;es, and Effects of a whole Species of Objects are enquired into.</P>
<P>DIVINITY or Theology, as it proves the Exi&s;t|ence of a Deity, and the Immortality of Souls, is compos'd partly of Rea&s;onings concerning particular, and partly concerning general Facts. It has a Foun|dation in <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> &s;o far as it is &s;upported by Expe|rience. But its be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olid Foundation is <HI>Faith</HI> and divine Revelation.</P>
<P>MORALS and Critici&s;m are not &s;o properly Objects of the Under&s;tanding as of Ta&s;te and Sentiment. Beauty, whether moral or natural, is felt, more pro|perly than perceiv'd. Or if we rea&s;on concerning it, and endeavour to fix its Standard, we regard a new Fact, <HI>viz.</HI> the general Ta&s;te of Mankind, or &s;ome &s;uch Fact, which may be the Object of Rea&s;oning and Enquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="249">
WHEN we run over Libraries, per&s;uaded of the&s;e Principles, what Havoc mu&s;t we make? If we take in hand any Volume; of Divinity or School Meta|phy&s;ics, for In&s;tance; let us a&s;k, <HI>Does it contain any ab&s;tract Rea&s;onings concerning Quantity or Number?</HI> No. <HI>Does it contain any experimental Rea&s;onings con|cerning Matters of Fact or Exi&s;tence?</HI> No. Commit it then to the Flames: For it can contain nothing but Sophi&s;try and Illu&s;ion.</P>
