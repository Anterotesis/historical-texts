<LG>
<L>'_T WERE well, my <HI>Laelius,</HI> if I could pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>That prudent Coun&s;el which I had from You:</L>
<L>To quit the Mu&s;e before her Spirits &s;ink,</L>
<L>For&s;ake my Rhymes, and wa&s;h my Hands of Ink.</L>
<L>But, &s;pite of all the Precepts You impart,</L>
<L>This Itch of Scribbling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Parody of a Line in a late Poem.</NOTE> <HI>clings about my Heart.</HI></L>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<L>'Tis a Di&s;ea&s;e above the Doctor's Skill,</L>
<L>Too &s;tubborn to be cur'd with <HI>Drop</HI> or <HI>Pill.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND yet, believe me, I have often try'd</L>
<L>To take your fav'rite Maxim for my Guide.</L>
<L><HI>Nil admirari</HI> dwells upon your Tongue:</L>
<L>So <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ings, and I approve his Song.</L>
<L>But like <HI>Medea,</HI> frantic in her Love,</L>
<L>I cannot practi&s;e what I thus approve.</L>
<L>Too fond of Ver&s;e, I wa&s;te my precious Time</L>
<L>In Sounds, and Similies, and worthle&s;s Rhyme;</L>
<L>Mad as the Prie&s;t, who, in poetic Rage,</L>
<L>With Floods of Non&s;en&s;e deluges the Stage:</L>
<L>What tho' you damn one Offspring of his Brain?</L>
<L>Prolific Dullne&s;s quickly &s;pawns again:</L>
<L>This Mon&s;ter cru&s;h'd, another &s;trait appears,</L>
<L>Head after Head the &s;prouting Hydra rears;</L>
<L>De&s;pi&s;ing all the Cen&s;ures of the Town,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Per&s;on's Judgment, but his own;</L>
<PB N="3" REF="4">
<L>For tho' pronounc'd a Fool by all the Pit,</L>
<L>He impudently thinks him&s;elf a Wit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A SOBER Countryman, as Stories &s;ay,</L>
<L>Would vi&s;it <HI>Bedlam</HI> on a certain Day;</L>
<L>Where, as he pitied a poor Wretch's Ca&s;e,</L>
<L>The merry Madman laugh'd him in the Face,</L>
<L>And cry'd, Alas! your Judgment's very bad,</L>
<L>Believe me, 'tis not I, but You, are mad!</L>
<L>Mankind are run di&s;tracted ev'ry where,</L>
<L>All but a few, who keep their Sen&s;es <HI>Here.</HI></L>
<L>You &s;ee our Madman, tho' prodigious ill,</L>
<L>Was happy in his own Opinion &s;till.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOR lives a Wretch, &s;o wretched in the Town,</L>
<L>But has &s;ome darling Plea&s;ure of his own,</L>
<L>Which he calls Happine&s;s. 'Tis my Delight,</L>
<L>My Plea&s;ure, and my Happine&s;s, to write;</L>
<L>For Happine&s;s we various Ways explore;</L>
<L>Some think it plac'd in Wealth, and &s;ome in Pow'r;</L>
<PB N="4" REF="5">
<L>Others believe in Luxury it lies,</L>
<L>In Women &s;ome, and &s;ome in Butterflies.</L>
<L>All other Gifts of Fortune are confin'd,</L>
<L>But Plea&s;ure's free, and common as the Wind:</L>
<L>The Cobler feels it often as the Peer;</L>
<L>One's drown'd in Politics, and one in Beer:</L>
<L>One's pleas'd with Honours, one with being drunk,</L>
<L><HI>This</HI> fondly courts a Ribband, <HI>that</HI> a Punk.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THERE are who fix their Plea&s;ure in a Race,</L>
<L>Who&s;e Acres le&s;&s;en, as their Steeds increa&s;e;</L>
<L>Some place their Joys in ancient Coins, and &s;ome</L>
<L>Admire the curious Bu&s;ts of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome:</HI></L>
<L>Others in Painting all their Fortune wa&s;te,</L>
<L>While dunning Trade&s;men cur&s;e their lavi&s;h Ta&s;te.</L>
<L>So much they honour the illu&s;trious Dead,</L>
<L>They wrong the Living of their daily Bread.</L>
<L>In Building &s;ome con&s;ume a va&s;t E&s;tate,</L>
<L>And only leave their Heirs the Walls to eat;</L>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<L>The&s;e for a Supper many Hundreds pay,</L>
<L>While tho&s;e in Mu&s;ic tune their Wealth away.</L>
<L>Thus diff'rent as our Faces are our Views;</L>
<L>Yet each this Harlot <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> pur&s;ues;</L>
<L>This common Strumpet is by all ador'd,</L>
<L>She's Mi&s;tre&s;s to the Fidler, and the Lord.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ONE, whom her Charms unluckily delight,</L>
<L>Courts her at Gaming-tables ev'ry Night:</L>
<L>No matter what her &s;aucy Favours co&s;t,</L>
<L>He will enjoy her till his Fortune's lo&s;t;</L>
<L>Carele&s;s of what his Wife and Chidren do:</L>
<L>Let Wife and Children &s;tarve, what's that to You?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YOU may condemn our Game&s;ters, if you plea&s;e:</L>
<L>But is he more ridiculous than the&s;e,</L>
<L>Who count their glitt'ring Dirt e&s;&s;ential Bli&s;s?</L>
<L><HI>Umidius</HI> has no other Joy but this.</L>
<L>For Gold he &s;tudies, &s;trives, and toils, and &s;weats;</L>
<L>For Gold he &s;wears, and lyes, and jobs, and cheats.</L>
<PB N="6" REF="7">
<L>Full fifty thou&s;and Pounds he has in Store,</L>
<L>And yet he covets fifty thou&s;and more.</L>
<L>No wild Profu&s;ion wa&s;tes his u&s;ele&s;s Hoard;</L>
<L>No Soups, or <HI>French</HI> Rago&ucirc;s, adorn his Board:</L>
<L>But, left &s;uch Diet &s;hould provoke his Lu&s;t,</L>
<L>He dines, like <HI>Seneca,</HI> upon a Cru&s;t;</L>
<L>And thinks the <HI>Turks</HI> Religion mo&s;t divine,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e it has forbid them drinking Wine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ANOTHER, who <HI>Lucullus</HI> would excel</L>
<L>In the luxurious Arts of eating well,</L>
<L>Plump as a Swine of <HI>Epicurus</HI> looks,</L>
<L>His God his Belly, and his Glory Cooks.</L>
<L>So many Di&s;hes on his Board appear,</L>
<L>'Twould &s;urfeit you to read his Bill of Fare:</L>
<L>And of one Dinner the Expence &s;o large,</L>
<L>Not <HI>Peter</HI> often could &s;upport the Charge.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE gay <HI>Adonis,</HI> of a diff'rent Mind,</L>
<L>Counts Love the <HI>Summum Bonum</HI> of Mankind.</L>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
<L>Love is the great Employment of his Life,</L>
<L>A Pa&s;&s;ion very plea&s;ing to a Wife:</L>
<L>But Wife he is determin'd to have none;</L>
<L>For our penurious Laws allow but one.</L>
<L>Of willing Nymphs he keeps a mighty Store;</L>
<L>Not <HI>Solomon</HI> him&s;elf had many more:</L>
<L>The&s;e are his Happine&s;s, tho' Goats may be</L>
<L>Much happier Animals, perhaps, than <HI>he.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ACTEON rides the Fields with rapid Pace;</L>
<L>He feels no Happine&s;s, but in a Chace:</L>
<L>To him the Genius of his Hounds is known,</L>
<L>And <HI>Jowler's</HI> Nature, better than his own.</L>
<L>Ask him if <HI>Jowler</HI> &s;trives to &s;tarve her Young?</L>
<L>He'll wonder at the Folly of your Tongue:</L>
<L>Yet he, more cruel, wickedly inclines</L>
<L>To &s;tarve the native I&s;&s;ue of his Loins.</L>
<L>Go to thy Dogs, inhuman, thoughtle&s;s Elf!</L>

<L>'Tis plain, however, 'tis not in a Wife.</L>

<LG>
<L>BIBLUS, with thir&s;ty Throat, and firy Face,</L>
<L>Has fix'd his chiefe&s;t Plea&s;ure in a Gla&s;s;</L>
<L>Drinking and Dozing are his dear Delight;</L>
<L>All Day he dozes, and he drinks all Night:</L>
<L>His Wife and he alternate Watches keep;</L>

<L>Dextrous as Racers on <HI>Olympian</HI> Plains,</L>

<L>CHREMES, devoutly mad, for&s;akes his Wife,</L>
<L>His Friends and Children, for a future Life:</L>
