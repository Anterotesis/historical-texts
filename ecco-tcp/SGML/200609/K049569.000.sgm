<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>TO write any thing tolerable about <HI>Fevers,</HI> or any thing wor&s;e than what has already been advanced by &s;ome one or other on the Head, is perhaps no ea&s;ie matter. The ridiculous manner of accounting for their Cau&s;es and Symptoms, u&s;ed by &s;ome Pretenders to <HI>Medicine</HI> and <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> has perhaps contributed (in its way) to that contempt, to which (with &s;uch Expence of <HI>Satyr</HI> and <HI>Wit</HI>) they and their Art have been expos'd.</P>
<P>I have not the Arrogance to think the few following Sheets, will conduce
<PB REF="3">
any thing to wipe it off; But of this I'm &s;ure, if this <HI>Theory</HI> prove Fal&s;e, the choices behind are fewer by one of the true Kind, which endea|vours to account from their Appear|ances from <HI>Mechanick</HI> Principles.</P>
<P>The Wi&s;er part of Mankind are now per&s;waded, That this Machine we carry about, is nothing but an In|finity of Branching and Winding Canals, fill'd with Liquors of differ|ent Natures; and I am mightily out in my Conjunctures, if for the Fu|ture any be heard about <HI>Theories</HI> of <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> or the manner of the Operation of Medicines, who do not rea&s;on from the&s;e <HI>Data,</HI> and their ne|ce&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences. And &s;eeing <HI>Continual Fevers,</HI> are only a Com|plication of Symptoms, which natu|rally follow upon a general Ob&s;tructi|on of the&s;e Canals (or the <HI>Glands</HI> which they con&s;titute) and the nece&s;&s;a|ry Effects thereof, as I reckon; None,
<PB REF="4">
I hope, will be angry I have call'd &s;uch a manner of Accounting for them <HI>New,</HI> &s;eeing for any thing I know (as to the main thereof) it is really &s;o.</P>
<P>For the &s;tructure of the <HI>Glands,</HI> and the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Secretion,</HI> the Foundation is <HI>Bellini</HI>'s, but I hope it has lo&s;t nothing in my hands. I have added &s;omethings, extended others, and made all plain and con&s;equential.</P>
<P>As to the other things here occa&s;i|onally explain'd, which, adding what <HI>Bellini</HI> had advanc'd about <HI>Blood-Letting,</HI> make up the great and prin|cipal Operations, perform'd by Medi|cines on Animal Bodies; I have very frankly borrow'd what of them I found for my purpo&s;e, from <HI>Borelli,</HI> the fore&s;aid <HI>Bellini,</HI> and another Gentleman whom I reckon the Orna|ment of his Profe&s;&s;ion and Our Coun|trey: But for the mo&s;t part, pointing at Place and Per&s;on. And I &s;hall
<PB REF="5">
reckon my &s;elf no more a <HI>Plagiary</HI> for this, than a Lawyer is to be ac|counted one for quoting his <HI>Code,</HI> or <HI>Pandects.</HI></P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of entering upon tho&s;e thoughts, was the noi&s;e and bu&s;tle has been made among us about <HI>Vomiting in Fevers,</HI> about a Year ago: I En|deavour'd to &s;atisfie my &s;elf &s;o as you may &s;ee, and had the Vanity to think there might be &s;ome as great Fools as I, If I be mi&s;taken it's not the fir&s;t time</P>
<P>I have not been over nice in ran|ging the Particulars here contain'd, tho&s;e who read the whole will &s;ee their dependance, and for others I was not at the pains to lay in.</P>
<P>The Language is that which mo&s;t ea&s;ily dropt from my Pen at fir&s;t wri|ting, the Roughne&s;s of &s;ome terms of Art I cou'd not avoid, and the purity of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue is neither the growth of our Country, nor of my
<PB REF="6">
occa&s;ions, if it be intelligible it is all (and perhaps &s;ome may &s;ay more than) I de&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>I neither expect nor de&s;ire any re|putation from the&s;e Papers, for I &s;uf|ficiently know how few &s;uch things oblige. Be&s;ides, I'm dreadfully af|fraid few will Read them, and not over many under&s;tand them, for want of the nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications, of a moderate attention, and a &s;mattering of the Mathematicks. The fir&s;t is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, but for the latter they may even have a &s;trong Faith, tho both for them and my &s;elf, I cou'd wi&s;h it were joyn'd with Knowledge.</P>
<P>As for Cen&s;ure, I am in no great dread of it; For I &s;hall lye Secure (be|cau&s;e conceal'd) and &s;ee its adver&s;aries (if it have the honour to provoke any) &s;hoot at rovers. If any &s;hall take the pains to confute what I have here ad|vanc'd, he may do it very &s;afely for his humble Servant, If he bungle it,
<PB REF="7">
he'll do me an honour, by &s;hewing it is not &s;uch as every Body is able to di&s;|prove; If he do it to purpo&s;e he'll do me a kindne&s;s, by freeing me from my errors. I de&s;ign for the future to meddle no more with it, than if it had dropt from the Clouds.</P>
<P>In fine, all my pre&s;ent concern is for the Book&s;eller; If he ben't a lo&s;er, (which misfortune wou'd be the mo&s;t effectual confutation) it is indiffer|ent to me, whether it peri&s;h by a parti|cular, or the general conflagration.</P>

<P>And generally I &s;hould think either the above mention'd &s;udden changes (which may happen a Thou&s;and other ways different from the Sea&s;on) or a direct conti|nu'd fit of violent Cold, or exce&s;&s;es in Eating or Drinking; one or all of the&s;e, have a large &s;hare in mo&s;t of our Continal Fevers.</P>

<P>The mo&s;t common and gene|rally obtaining Opinion about Fe|vers is, that they are more imme|diately produc'd by &s;ome <HI>Morbifick</HI> matter; (like a Poi&s;on) which mixing and circulating with the ma&s;s of the Blood, Produces all tho&s;e frightful Symtoms which we feel. This Opinion is &s;ufficiently confuted, <HI>Prop.</HI> 222. 223. 224. 2<HI>dae. part.</HI> of <HI>Borelli</HI>'s Book <HI>De mot. Animal.</HI> whither I refer the reader; only adding (to what he has there
<PB N="33" REF="40">
adduced) this one Argument.</P>
<P>When any Corrupt Matter is mix'd with the Blood, &s;o as to vitiate the whole ma&s;s, (as Vine|gar among Water) the way of Curing &s;uch a vitiation is either by forming new <HI>Glands</HI> to derive the vitious part of the mixture; or by draining the whole mixture good and bad, and Sub&s;tituting new pure Blood in it's place: Or la&s;tly, by di&s;po&s;ing the already form'd <HI>Glands</HI> to &s;ecern the corrupted part.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e is ridiculous.</P>
<P>Some thing like the &s;econd is done, when the Blood is really vitiate in the whole; as inveterate Poxes, but that cure cannot here have a place as &s;hall be afterwards &s;hewn.</P>
<P>As to the third way; let us con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="34" REF="41">1. How hard it is to think (when the whole Ma&s;s is &s;uppos'd corrupted) that the vitious part, all at once, or, in the &s;pace of a few Hours (in which time we know, after a <HI>Cri&s;e,</HI> Fevers commonly leave People) &s;hould be intirely evacuated. This is not like the actions of Nature, which works lei|&s;urely and by degrees.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us con&s;ider, whence all the <HI>Glands</HI> (at lea&s;t the greater part of them) &s;hould be &s;o alter'd (&s;eeing their configurations are &s;o different, and naturally they &s;e|cern &s;o different Liquors) as, all at one time to &s;eparate the &s;ame <HI>Morbifick</HI> matter. And,</P>
<P N="3">3. How at the <HI>Cri&s;e</HI> only, and at no other time, they &s;hould be &s;o di&s;pos'd.</P>
<P>It will be very hard in any other <HI>Theory</HI> (in this more particularly) &s;ave ours, to account for the&s;e
<PB N="35" REF="42">
things without recurring to mira|cles, or the ab&s;urd <HI>Metaphorick</HI> Terms of Sympathy, Antipathy and the like. The&s;e then, with what <HI>Borelli</HI> has brought again&s;t this Opinion in the forecited places, are abundantly &s;ufficient to &s;how the ridiculou&s;ne&s;s thereof.</P>
<P>But there are &s;everal Phy&s;icians, who ob&s;erving, that, in Fevers, there was (by a Vomit) a tough vi&s;cid matter thrown out of the &s;tomach, have thought this matter, generated there, and mixing with the Ma&s;s of the Blood, might be a con&s;iderable Part of the cau&s;e of <HI>Fevers</HI>; at lea&s;t might con&s;iderably augment the &s;ame; and have from thence brought Arguments for the nece&s;&s;ity of Vomiting in Fevers.</P>
<P>This Opinion &s;uppo&s;es the&s;e things,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Quantity of the <HI>Morbifick</HI> matter excern'd by a
<PB N="36" REF="43">
Vomit, before the Admini&s;tration thereof, was exi&s;tent in the cavity of the Stomach, after the &s;ame manner that other things are, which are deriv'd into the Ma&s;s of the Blood, el&s;e it could never get thither. This I &s;hall con&s;ider when I come to &s;peak of the Ope|ration and effects of Vomiting.</P>
<P N="2">2. That it is at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible, this <HI>Morbifick</HI> matter may be de|riv'd into the Ma&s;s of Blood; let us at pre&s;ent con&s;ider this.</P>
<P>I know no way any thing of any tolerable con&s;i&s;tence, can get into the Ma&s;s of the Blood; but by the <HI>Lacteal Veins.</HI> It is true, from the &s;udden effects of &s;ome Spirits, Medicines, and &s;trong Meats, we are certain, that the more refin'd parts of the&s;e, may get into the <HI>Brain,</HI> without going the tedious Circle of the <HI>Lacteals</HI>: But this is done by the Reciprocal

<P>To decide the matter, I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e my Reader to have con|&s;ider'd the 2 la&s;t <HI>prop.</HI> (<HI>Ex ijs quae ad &s;eparationes</HI>) which <HI>Beilini</HI> has in his <HI>Preface</HI> to his Book <HI>De &V;ri|nis &amp; Pul&s;ibus,</HI> &amp;c. and the 27. 28. and 40. of his la&s;t Book <HI>De Motu Cordis,</HI> &amp;c. where the con&s;truction of the <HI>Glands</HI> and the manner of &s;eparations are demon&s;tratively unfolded, which I take to be the noble&s;t di&s;covery (in the&s;e matters) of this age.

<P>To the&s;e I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. As to the Second; The <HI>Peritaltik</HI> motion being recipro|cal, it adds as much (to the mo|tion of the <HI>Chylous</HI> matter) in it's de&s;cent towards the <HI>Rectum,</HI> as it takes away, in its a&s;cent towards the Stomach; and &s;o cannot &s;erve that end, the <HI>Plicae</HI> and circumvo|lutions of the&s;e <HI>Inte&s;tines</HI> (which we have con&s;ider'd) being only to
<PB N="57" REF="64">
be rely'd on, for this purpo&s;e. As to the <HI>Valv's,</HI> we know they all open toward the <HI>Rectum,</HI> and &s;erve only to &s;top the a&s;cent of the <HI>Faeces</HI> in the Peri&s;taltick motion, and &s;o cannot retard the motion of the <HI>Chylous</HI> matter.</P>
<P N="3">3. As to the Third; We like|wi&s;e know, that all the&s;e Medica|ments are di&s;&s;olv'd into a thin Li|quor by heat (as <HI>Turpentine,</HI> But|ter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) Be&s;ides that only the mo&s;t &s;pritious and lea&s;t vi&s;cid parts enter the Blood; which is not &s;aid of our <HI>Morbifick</HI> matter.</P>
<P N="4">4. As to the la&s;t; There is a great difference betwixt a Liquor immediately after it is &s;eparated, and when it has Stagnated &s;ome|time in the Con&s;ervatory of the <HI>Gland</HI>; for then the Aqueous and more humid Parts evaporate; and by its &s;tagnation it acquires an in|eptitude to motion: And tho the
<PB N="58" REF="65">
Blood flows very ea&s;ily in the <HI>Ar|terys</HI> and <HI>Veins</HI>; yet I defy any to cau&s;e extrava&s;at Blood enter its Ve&s;&s;els again. But more particu|larly, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the <HI>Liver</HI> to be a very large Ve&s;&s;el, and (if it were evolv'd) to make an <HI>Ar|tery</HI> many Thou&s;and times longer than that of the Canal of the &s;mall <HI>Inte&s;tines,</HI> or <HI>Te&s;ticulus Humanus</HI> either; and &s;o it is no wonder it &s;eparate a vi&s;cid matter; the mo|tion of the Blood there being very &s;mall: But &s;till I a&s;&s;ert it is not near &s;o vicid as our <HI>Morbifick</HI> mat|ter. As to the <HI>Phlegm,</HI> we know it is not naturally produc'd; and the <HI>Morbifick</HI> matter it &s;elf (again&s;t which we di&s;pute) might be as well objected; for it is only the Stagnation, Corruption and Eva|poration of the Humidity, which occa&s;ions both; the &s;ame might be &s;aid of the Purulent matter which

pa&s;&s;es by <HI>&V;rine,</HI> but that we know it proceeds from an <HI>&V;lcer</HI> in the <HI>Kidney</HI> or Neck of the <HI>Bladder,</HI> and is not di&s;cerned with the <HI>&V;rine.</HI></P>
<P>Having dwelt thus long on the Opinions of others, I come now to con&s;ider the proper remedies of Fevers which I reduce to, 1. <HI>Blood letting,</HI> 2. <HI>Vomiting,</HI> 3. <HI>Purging,</HI> And, 4. The <HI>Medicaments</HI> which encrea&s;e the le&s;s <HI>Sen&s;ible Evacuati|ons</HI>; under which head I compre|hend Sweating, Per&s;piration, and the like.</P>
<P>I do not here con&s;ider bli&s;tering and outward Applications; &s;eeing (in my Opinion) they are only u&s;eful to remove the accidental effects, and not the cau&s;e of Fevers, without which they cannot be &s;aid to be truly cur'd.</P>

Stomach, whereby they are brought into motion, and con&s;e|quently derive great Plenty of their <HI>Liquidum</HI> into the places, which makes &s;uch contractions as &s;queez the&s;e <HI>Glands</HI> of the matter, which produces the&s;e fits of Vo|miting: Be&s;ides that the &s;ame cau&s;e may (upon other <HI>Fibres</HI>) produce the antecedent Sickne&s;s which we feel in Sea-Vomits. 3. By a Vomit of warm water (for example) there are often produced &s;everal fits of Vomiting; and yet we all know there is no <HI>vis Stimu|lans</HI> in it; So that all it can do, is, that by its warmth (which is a kind of a <HI>Fotus</HI>) it elicits the matter from the <HI>Glands</HI> of the Stomach, which occa&s;ions this Vomiting. I cou'd add a great deal more to confirm this propo&s;ition, but I think this &s;ufficient. I &s;ay,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="67" REF="74">3<HI>ly.</HI> That the <HI>Morbifick</HI> matter (excern'd by Vomiting) is not exi&s;t|ent in the Cavity of the Stomach, (at lea&s;t in &s;uch Plenty at it is ex|cern'd by a forc'd Vomite) before the admini&s;tration thereof. 1, This is an evident Corollary from the former <HI>Prop.</HI> The Vomite does not Act (at lea&s;t after the fir&s;t one or two fits) by it's own <HI>vis ctimulans</HI>; There is (in Vomiting) produc'd a violent contraction of the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Stomach, the <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> of the <HI>Addomen</HI> and <HI>Diaphragm,</HI> which mu&s;t be occa&s;ioned &s;omeway. There is nothing (in Vomiting) which can occa&s;ion this, but either the <HI>vis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">timulans Vomitorii,</HI> or of the ex|cern'd <HI>Morbifick</HI> matter; and &s;ince (as has been already proved) it can not be the former, it mu&s;t of nece&s;|&s;ity be the latter: Wherefore if the <HI>Morbifick</HI> matter were already ex|i&s;tent in the cavity of the Stomach,
<PB N="68" REF="75">
the Vomite were of little u&s;e after one or two Fits; which is contrary to experience. 2. If this <HI>Morbifick</HI> matter were already in the cavity of the Stomach, it is not po&s;&s;ible but that one or two plentifull fits of Vomiting would eject all that is there; &s;o that afterward there &s;hould none be thrown out how|ever violent the con&s;equent fits were, which is likewi&s;e contrary to experience. The force of the <HI>Mu&s;|cular Fibres</HI> of the Stomach, The <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> and <HI>Dia|phragm</HI> (which two la&s;t Mon&s;ieur <HI>Chirac,</HI> Profe&s;&s;or of Medicine at <HI>Montpellier,</HI> by an ea&s;y experiment, has &s;hewn to concur principally in Vomiting. <HI>vide, The Preface of Tournfort's Histoire des Plants qui Nai&s;&s;ent aux environs de Paris</HI>) is at lea&s;t equal to 260000 <HI>lib.</HI> weight; (the force, of the <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> and <HI>Diaphragm</HI> being
<PB N="69" REF="76">
more than that of 248000 <HI>libs.</HI> and of the Stomach, not inferior to that of 12000 pounds) which force if it be not &s;ufficient to drive out all that is exi&s;tent in the cavity of the Stomach (however Vi&s;cid the matter be) I leave every one to judge. 3. Suppo&s;ing the <HI>Mor|bifick</HI> matter already in the cavity of the Stomach; It is Impo&s;&s;ible to give an account of the different effects of different Vomits: For Ex|ample, why an <HI>Antimonial</HI> Vomit does excern this <HI>Morbifick</HI> matter more plentifully than Whey or warm Water. For if before the In|ge&s;tion of either, the <HI>Morbifick</HI> matter is already in the Stomach, then the only thing left for them to do, is, to excite the Act of Vo|miting: But it is certain they may be both brought to be equal in that, <HI>i. e.</HI> they may be both brough to excite an equal unmber of fits of
<PB N="70" REF="77">
Vomiting; and that with equal violence (by taking their Quan|titys in a reciprocal proportion to their Vomitive Faculties) And yet their effects be very different, otherwi&s;e I omit (for avoiding tendiou&s;ne&s;s) the other arguments I can aduce to confirm this propo|&s;ition.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>ly.</HI> The whole deduction and Connection of this operation is thus: the Particles of the Vomitory by their <HI>Incuncation</HI> into the Orific<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the <HI>Emi&s;aries</HI> of the <HI>Glands,</HI> adja|cent to the &s;urface of the Stomach, do dilate the &s;ame (which by &s;ome extrin&s;ick cau&s;e) had been contract|ed and after the &s;ame manner do di&s;&s;olve (at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree) the Cohe&s;ion of the &s;tagnant <HI>Morbifick</HI> matter, and render it more Fluid; and con&s;equently, its re&s;i&s;tance le&s;s: Now the natural and con&s;tant action of the <HI>Glands</HI> being Secre|tion;
<PB N="71" REF="78">
and the <HI>Impedimentum</HI> (by the dilatation of the Orifice and attenuation of the Fluid) being totally taken away, or (at lea&s;t) made le&s;s than the natural <HI>Momen|tum</HI> of the <HI>Glands</HI>; The matter mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arly flow into the Ca|vity of the Stomach, till it be ac|cumulated in &s;uch a Quantity (which not being to be done in an in&s;tant, mu&s;t require &s;ome time) as is &s;ufficient (by the united loath|&s;omene&s;s and the <HI>vis &s;timulans</HI> of it and the Vomitory) to vellicate and force the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Stomach, <HI>Abdomen</HI> and <HI>Diaphragm</HI> (by the communication of the <HI>Nerves</HI> of the fir&s;t with the two la&s;t) into a vio|lent contraction, and thereby throw all out by the <HI>O&s;ophagus,</HI> which brings all to quiet again, Till there be a new, a &s;ufficient quanti|ty exerned from the&s;e <HI>Glands</HI> to re|produce the fore&s;aid Contraction:
<PB N="72" REF="79">
And thus there happens a fit of Vomiting and Quiet alternately, till either all the <HI>Morbifick</HI> matter be thrown out, or the force of the Vomit &s;o diluted, that it's no lon|ger able to elicit the <HI>Morbifick</HI> mat|ter from the <HI>Glands.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e Primary effects of Vomiting, there are two others, which ought not (tho le&s;s principal) to be omitted. The fir&s;t is, that in a &s;trong Vomit, or in one which requires &s;ome con|&s;iderable time before it operate, there often pa&s;&s;es &s;ome part there|of from the Stomach into the <HI>Inte|&s;tines,</HI> and occa&s;ions a gentle Purge, by di&s;&s;olving the <HI>Faeces,</HI> and velli|cating the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the <HI>Inte&s;tines,</HI> as &s;hall be more particularly &s;hown when we &s;peak of <HI>Purging.</HI> How|ever the effects of this, Purge very &s;eldom, or never go beyond the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI> For all gentle Purges (of which this is one) are confined
<PB N="73" REF="80">
within the&s;e. The &s;econd is, that the &s;trong contraction in &s;o many <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> Canals, which are at Work in Vomiting, and the violent concu&s;&s;ion which is produc'd over the whole Body, by a power (as has been &s;aid) which is not inferiour to that of two Hundred and Sixty Thou|&s;and weight, may and often does, take away the Ob&s;tructions in ma|ny other Canals, than tho&s;e which are more immediately concerned about the Stomach and <HI>O&s;ophagus,</HI> as we evidently &s;ee by that va&s;t Sweat which always breaks out after plentiful fits of Vomiting. From the&s;e I deduce,</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly.</HI> The Advantages of Vo|miting in the <HI>Cure</HI> of Fevers; which are, 1. The taking away the Ob&s;tructions of the <HI>Glands</HI> of the Stomach and (&s;ometimes of the <HI>Inte&s;tines,</HI> which is the princi|pal
<PB N="74" REF="81">
u&s;e of Vomiting; and how great a &s;tep this is toward the Cure of Fevers, every one will &s;ee who con&s;iders, that in Fevers oc|ca&s;ion'd by Intemperance, the Sto|mach is the Scene where this great Mi&s;chief is both contriv'd, and put into Execution; the Ob&s;tructi|on of the <HI>Glands</HI> thereof, being the fir&s;t and principal Cau&s;e of the&s;e Fevers; And in Fevers occa&s;ion'd by Cold, the Stomach and <HI>Inte|&s;tines</HI> being mo&s;t Expos'd, and lea&s;t Defended from the Cold Air, receives its fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Im|pre&s;&s;ions; which two (as formerly was &s;aid) have the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable &s;hare in the cau&s;e of our Con|tinual Fevers: And therefore it is, that Vomiting (being timeou&s;ly and plentifully us'd) very often prevents &s;uch Fevers. 2. Another Advantage of Vomiting is, That by the &s;trong Contraction of the
<PB N="75" REF="82">
<HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> Canals and the violent Concu&s;&s;ions of the whole Body thereby produced, the Ob&s;tructions of many other <HI>Glands</HI> are remov'd, as has been ju&s;t now &s;hown.) So that this with the former (removing &s;o con&s;ide|rable a part of the Cau&s;e, enables Nature to perform the re&s;t very ea|&s;ily. 3. A Third Convenience (if not Advantage) of Vomiting, is, That it is le&s;s dangerous than many of the Medicaments that are taken inwardly; The effects of this is confin'd to the <HI>Primae viae</HI>; (by which I always mean that wind|ing Canal, which is continued from the Mouth to the <HI>Sphincter ani,</HI>) and is con&s;equently le&s;s dan|gerous than tho&s;e which run the Circle of the Blood; For it is not to be doubted, that all Alterative Medicines have more or le&s;s dan|ger in them (from the effect of
<PB N="76" REF="83">
their Stimulations upon the <HI>Nerves,</HI> their Fermentations with the Blood, their Separating, or Pro|moting the Natural Cohe&s;ions of the Liquors of the Body, and their many other unknown Producti|ons.) That which goes the lea&s;t way, mu&s;t therefore have the lea&s;t danger: Now &s;ince it is certain, that Vomiting does not go out of the Stomach and <HI>Intestines</HI> (where the Canals are &s;trong and wide, and the Fluids are vi&s;cid and gro&s;s) there mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be le&s;s danger in it, than in the&s;e which enter into narrower and weaker Canals fill'd with more Fluid and finer Liquors. It is true indeed, there is &s;ome hazard from the bur&s;ting of the Capillary Ve&s;|&s;els of the internal Surfaces, by the violent Concu&s;&s;ions of the Body, occa&s;ioned by Vomiting; but this is ea&s;ily prevented by Blood-let|ting,
<PB N="77" REF="84">
which ought always to pre|ceed the plentiful u&s;e of vomito|ries in all Di&s;ea&s;es. Be&s;ides, &s;ome|times the violence of Vomit, is too great for the &s;trength of the Patient; but this is rather the fault of the Phy&s;ician than the Phy&s;ick: For the Strength, and (con&s;e|quently the violence of Vomits, as of all other Medicines) ought to be adju&s;ted by this Proportion, <HI>Viz.</HI> They ought to be in a compound|ed Proportion of the &s;trength of the Patient, and the danger of the Continuance of the Di&s;ea&s;e. If this were ob&s;erved, none cou'd ever Err in the Admini&s;tration of Medicines.</P>
<P N="3">III. Come we now to that which we call'd the Third proper Remedy of Fevers, to wit, <HI>Purg|ing</HI>; In explaining of which, I &s;hall, 1. Shew that Vomitive and Purgative Medicines differ only in
<PB N="78" REF="85">
degrees of the &s;ame Quality. 2. I &s;hall give a &s;hort account of the &s;everal &s;teps, and of the manner of this Operation. And, 3. Con|&s;ider its u&s;e in the Cure of Fevers. I &s;ay then,</P>
<P N="1">1. That Vomitive and Purga|tive Medicines, differ only in the degrees of the &s;ame Quality, <HI>i. e.</HI> Purgative Medicines, by encrea|&s;ing their force va&s;tly, and confin|ing it to a le&s;&s;er Quantity, either of a Fluid or &s;olid Body, become Vo|mitive, and Vomitive Medicines (if diluted) become Purgative. This will be evident from the&s;e Con&s;iderations. 1. We find by Experience, a &s;trong Purge never mi&s;&s;es (if either it be very &s;trong, or the Patient not very &s;trong) to Vomit, and the weaker part of a Vomit, which e&s;capes into the <HI>In|te&s;tines,</HI> does frequently Purge us. 2. The &s;ame Medicines (for ex|ample,
<PB N="79" REF="86">
<HI>Vinum Emeticum,</HI>) taken by the Mouth, will provoke Vo|miting, which giv'n by way of <HI>Gli&s;ter,</HI> will Purge: The &s;ame obtains in all &s;trong <HI>Emeticks.</HI> In &s;hort, all &s;trong Medicines of ei|ther kind con&s;tantly produce both the&s;e Effects. The rea&s;on of all which is this; If the Medica|ment of either kind be &s;o &s;trong as immediately to vellicate and &s;timulate the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Sto|mach, to dilate the Orifice, and attenuate the matter contain'd in the <HI>Glands</HI> thereof, it produces Vomiting; if it act but gently, &s;o as only to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Natural Mo|tion of Dige&s;tion, it goes by the <HI>Inte&s;tines,</HI> and di&s;&s;olves the Cohe|&s;ion of the <HI>Faeces,</HI> and finding there more &s;en&s;ible <HI>Fibres,</HI> is able to bring them into violent Motions, which produce Purging, as &s;hall be ju&s;t now &s;how'n. 3. It is im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="80" REF="87">
in any other <HI>Theory,</HI> to ac|count how the&s;e two different Medicines &s;hou'd upon the &s;ame Parts produce different Effects; For both the&s;e Medicines are ta|ken by the Mouth, go down the <HI>O&s;ophagus,</HI> and enter into the Sto|mach either in the form of a <HI>Li|quid,</HI> or are there by it reduc'd in|to a <HI>Liquid</HI>; and con&s;equently are brought in to contact with, and Operate on the &s;ame <HI>Fibres, Glands</HI> and <HI>Membranes</HI>; and yet produce (by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance) two different effects. It is &s;imply im|po&s;&s;ible to explain the manner of this, without &s;aying the one acts more powerfully and forceably, and makes more violent Contra|ctions, and con&s;equently is thrown up the mo&s;t patent way; the other more gently and &s;oftly, and has thereby time to &s;eek out the le&s;s obvious pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="81" REF="88">2<HI>dly</HI>: The account of the &s;eve|ral &s;teps, and of the manner of this Operation, is thus; Purgative Me|dicines, being receiv'd into the Mouth, and admitted into the Sto|mach, their particles vellicate and &s;timulate the <HI>Fibres</HI> thereof, and thereby encrea&s;e the dige&s;tive fa|culties, <HI>i. e.</HI> bring the <HI>Mu&s;cular Fi|bres</HI> of the &s;tomach, the <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> and <HI>Diaphragm</HI> into more frequent contractions than ordinary, till they are admited in|to the <HI>Inte&s;tines,</HI> the <HI>Fibres</HI> and <HI>Glands</HI> of which being more &s;en&s;i|ble than tho&s;e of the Stomach (who&s;e parts by the frequent rough Contacts; of one again&s;t another, and of the gro&s;s Bodies which are often thrown into it, are as it were dead'ned) they ea&s;ily move and bring into frequent and forceable contractions, whereby the&s;e <HI>Glands</HI> are &s;queez'd of a
<PB N="82" REF="89">
Fluid which lubricates the Pa&s;|&s;ages; and mixing with the fecu|lent matter of the <HI>Inte&s;tines</HI> (which is rendered Fluid by the &s;ame active and Stimulating quality of the Purgative medicine) renders it yet more Fluid, by which (and by the more than ordinary contracti|ons of the <HI>Inte&s;tines</HI>) it pa&s;&s;es more plentifully and ea&s;ily into the <HI>Re|ctum,</HI> and is thence ejected. This is the u&s;e of the more gentle Purges which only clean&s;e the <HI>In|te&s;tines.</HI> But tho&s;e of more force (be&s;ides all the&s;e) do (as to the greater and more &s;pirituous part) enter into the Ma&s;s of the Blood by the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> and mixing there|with produce many unnatural fer|mentations therein, &s;eparating or promoting the natural Cohe&s;ions of the Liquors of the Body, and acca&s;ioning many other unknown effects, as has been formerly &s;aid:
<PB N="83" REF="90">
And likewi&s;e there, vellicating the &s;piral <HI>Fibres</HI> of the <HI>Arteries</HI> and <HI>Veins,</HI> bring the&s;e into more force|able contractions, and thereby promote the Circulation of the Blood and make it run with grea|ter Velocity and force; and by this means in a &s;hort time wa&s;h away any ob&s;tructions that either hap|pen to be in the more direct <HI>Arte|ries,</HI> or the more complicated ones which con&s;titute the <HI>Glands,</HI> en|crea&s;e the in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, and purifie the Blood of all the gro&s;&s;er and more noxious parts, by the <HI>Ductus Cholodochus</HI> and <HI>Pancre|aticus</HI> which void them&s;elves into the <HI>Inte&s;tines.</HI> All the&s;e effects of the more powerful Purgatives are Vi&s;ible; for &s;ometime after one has taken &s;uch a &s;trong Purge, we find the Pul&s;e mightily encreas'd, the Per&s;piration augmented, the Spi|rits, or <HI>Liquidum Nervorum</HI> &s;pent,
<PB N="84" REF="91">
&s;pent, the vi&s;ible Excretions by Siege and Urine much greater, and the Body weak'ned; e&s;pecial|ly after a few days of &s;uch a cour&s;e. Whereby it is evident the&s;e Medi|cines mu&s;t operate after the man|ner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">w explained. From hence it is clear,</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> That the advantages of Purging in the cure of Fevers are very great, upon the&s;e two con&s;i|derations: 1. If the Purge be more gentle &s;o that it only &s;erve to clean&s;e the <HI>Inte&s;tines,</HI> it partly takes away the ob&s;truction of the <HI>Glands</HI> of the Stomach, and totally that of the <HI>Glands</HI> of the <HI>Inte&s;tines,</HI> which is a con&s;iderable &s;tep to|wards the cure. But, 2. If the Purge be more violent, &s;o that it enter in any plenty into the Ma&s;s of the Blood, it conduces &s;o much toward the removal of the ob&s;tru|ctions of mo&s;t of the other <HI>Glands,</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="92">
that nature is able to perform the re&s;t very ea&s;ily her &s;elf. But alas! this la&s;t ca&s;e has &s;o much danger, and &s;o many inconveniencies in it, as render it as un&s;afe, as otherwi&s;e (if the&s;e could be remov'd) it would be u&s;eful. <HI>Bellini</HI> in his Book <HI>De &V;rinis &amp; Pul&s;ibus, page</HI> 222. has demon&s;trated that in vio|lent Purges there is a greater dan|ger by far than in Blood-letting. His words are, <Q REND="inline"><HI>Quia vero quic|quid e&s;t &s;u&s;picionis in mi&s;&s;ione Sanguinis ad &s;olum fermentati|onem non naturalem, quae po&s;&s;ibilis per ip&s;am e&s;t in reliquo Sanguine, redigitur, &amp; hoc uno de nomine periculo non vacat; &s;i igitur hujus mali &s;u&s;picione careret purgatio, illa potius adhibenda, quam venae &s;ectio; cum purgatio ejus loco cae|troquin e&s;&s;e po&s;&s;it: &s;ed res e con|ver&s;o &s;e habet, &s;u&s;picio enim ejus mali a mi&s;&s;ione Sanguinis e&s;t &s;u&s;|picio</HI>

That vio|lent Purges have a great deal of real danger in them ab&s;olutely, without re&s;pect to other remedies; and indeed the&s;e unatural Fer|mentations and changes of the Co|he&s;ion of the Fluids in&s;tead of pro|moting the cure, often encrea&s;es the cau&s;e of Fevers, to wit the ob|&s;truction of the <HI>Arteries</HI> which
<PB N="87" REF="94">
con&s;titute the <HI>Glands.</HI> 2. That vio|lent Purges are re&s;pectively much more dangerous than Blood-let|ting, wherefore this la&s;t is a more &s;afe, and con&s;equently a more u&s;e|ful expedient in the cure of Fevers than the former. And I &s;ay, 3. That violent Purges are a much more dangerous remedy in Fevers, than Vomitings are; For Vomits extend no further than the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI> where the Canals are &s;trong and wide, the Fluid vi&s;cid and Gro&s;s, But violent Purges reach all the &s;lender Ve&s;&s;els and Noble Li|quors of the Body, where the dan|ger of any Con&s;iderable alteration is extreamly great. Wherefore up|on this account, I &s;ay, that the danger of Violent Purges is to that of Vomiting, as the length of the Canals of the whole Circuit of the Blood, is to the length of the Ca|nals of the <HI>Primae Viae.</HI> And how
<PB N="88" REF="95">
much longer the fir&s;t is than the latter, I leave the Reader to con|&s;ider. Be&s;ides all the&s;e, there are &s;o many other known and evident dangers in violent Purges, that the only part of Purging which is &s;afe (in curing Fevers) is <HI>Gli&s;tering,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>Lotiones Alvi,</HI> or rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> either of the&s;e, only that gentle Purge which is the concomitant of every plentiful Vomiting.</P>
<P N="4">IV. We are come now to the la&s;t proper Remedy of Fevers, which was the <HI>Medicaments which encrea&s;e the le&s;s &s;en&s;ible evacuations.</HI> But all that can be pertinently &s;aid on this head; is &s;o learnedly and accurately already handled in a Treati&s;e entituled, <HI>Archibaldi Pu|carnij Di&s;&s;ertatio de Curatione febri|um quae per Evacuationes in&s;tituitur,</HI> that thither I &s;hall refer the Rea|der, only adding the rea&s;on why &s;uch Medicaments Admini&s;tred in
<PB N="89" REF="96">
the begining of Fevers, do rather encrea&s;e than cure them, which is this: In an Ob&s;truction of the <HI>Glands,</HI> the Blood in the Compli|cated <HI>Arteries</HI> which con&s;titutes the &s;ame, &s;tagnates up to the next Branching thereof, neare&s;t the Heart, and thereby a con&s;iderable length thereof becomes ob&s;tructed and unpa&s;&s;able; the only way this ob&s;truction can be remov'd is by the force of the Blood, which in every Pul&s;e or contraction of the heart, wa&s;hes off a particle of the &s;ame till the whole be dig'd away; as &s;hall be &s;hown. Now the <HI>Ar|teries</HI> which con&s;titute the <HI>Glands,</HI> whereby the in&s;en&s;ible evacuati|ons are naturally &s;ecern'd, being in the begining of the Fever &s;o much ob&s;tructed; It is &s;imply impo&s;&s;ible for &s;uch Medicaments to carry the&s;e ob&s;tructions off as they are ju&s;t now; they mu&s;t rather force

<P N="1">1. That pure Mercury, or Quick&s;ilver, con&s;i&s;ts of parts (I mean tho&s;e of the fir&s;t compo&s;ition,

<P>This has been &s;uppos'd by all who have written any thing tole|rable about the Nature of this Mi|neral; it is true indeed, &s;ome have &s;uppos'd it &s;o, becau&s;e they &s;aw that dividing Mercury upon a plain (even by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Mi|cro&s;cope) &s;till the upper part re|tain'd its Sphericity, which they could not &s;o ea&s;ily ob&s;erve in other Fluids: But the true Rea&s;on of this is, The great Gravity of the Mer|cury, in re&s;pect of other Fluids, and the uniform pre&s;&s;ure of the Medium. For all Fluids will re|tain their Sphericity till their
<PB N="95" REF="102">
Quantity be &s;o dimini&s;h'd (either by their being another Heteroge|neous &s;pecifically lighter Body in|cluded in them, or by their Gravi|ty decrea&s;ing at a greater rate than their Surfaces) that they are of e|qual Gravity with unequal Porti|on of the Medium they are in, and then they will receive any Figure the Motion of the Medium can imprint on them. However the divi&s;ions of Mercury mu&s;t be very &s;mall before it can be reduc'd to this State; but that it can at la&s;t be brought to it, is evident from the mixing and pounding of Quick|&s;ilver among common water, in which we know a part of the Quick-&s;ilver is lo&s;t, by the Dimi|nution of its weight, and the di&s;|colouring and effects of this Wa|ter.</P>
<P>But the true Rea&s;on why the former Suppo&s;ition is to be made,
<PB N="96" REF="103">
is, becau&s;e from it &s;ome of the Phe|nomena of Mercury may be ac|counted for.</P>
<P>For, from thence it is evident, why Mercury (tho' the heavie&s;t known Fluid) ri&s;es with fewer de|grees of Heat in an Alembick, than any other. 1. It's parts (of the fir&s;t Compo&s;ition) being ex|ceedingly &s;mall, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;maller than &s;uch parts of any other Fluid, it mu&s;t ri&s;e &s;ooner than they; becau&s;e the Gravity of its Particles has a le&s;&s;er Proportion to their Surfaces, than the Gravity of the Particles of any other Fluid has to their Sur|faces; for the Gravities of Bodies decrea&s;e in a Triplicate Proporti|on, whereas their Surfaces decrea&s;e only in a Duplicate one. Thus &s;uppo&s;ing (for Example) the Dia|meter of a Particle of Mercury (of the fir&s;t Compo&s;ition) to be to the Diameter of a Particle of Water
<PB N="97" REF="104">
(of the &s;ame Compo&s;ition.) As 2 to 300; (and we may ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;e the Odds infinitely greater,) their Surfaces will be as 4 to 90000. And their So|lidities, <HI>i. e.</HI> their Gravities, as 8 to 27000000. This upon Suppo&s;ition their Specifick Gravities were equal; but &s;uppo&s;ing (at the large&s;t) the Specifick Gravity of Mercury to that of Water, as 15 to 1. The real Gra|vities of &s;uch Particles will be to one another, as 120 to 27000000: Whence it is evident, that not only the <HI>ratio</HI> of 8 to 4 or 2 to 1. is much le&s;s than that of 27000000 to 90000 or 300 to 1. And therefore upon &s;uch Suppo&s;i|tion it will follow, That the Gravi|ties of &s;uch Particles of Mercury, wou'd be much le&s;s than that of &s;uch Particles of Water: And that the Surfaces of the&s;e Particles of Mercury, wou'd be much larger, in re&s;pect of their Gravities, than that of the like Particles of Water, in re&s;pect of their Gravities; and con&s;equently the Mer|cury wou'd ri&s;e in the Alembick with much Fewer degrees of Heat, than the Water upon this account. But,

2. The Particles of Mercury are per|fectly Spherical and Equal; (for all Homogeneous Bodies mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of Particles <HI>Similes &amp; aequales</HI> in the <HI>Eu|clidean Sen&s;e, Vide Def.</HI> 1. 6. <HI>&amp;</HI> 9. 11. <HI>Euclid.</HI>) and con&s;equently can only touch in points, and thereby their Sublimation will become more ea&s;ie.

Now the Force and Value of &s;uch a contact as this of 9 Points, is le&s;s (<HI>Cae|teris paribus,</HI>) than that of other &s;olid Bodies generated by the Circum|rotation of what ever Figure, Regular, or Irregular, Right-lin'd, or Curve|lin'd: For, The Contacts of Circles is the Mea&s;ure of the Contacts, of all other Figures what&s;oever; and tho in &s;ome Curves their Contacts in &s;ome Points, may be le&s;s than that of Circles, (<HI>vide Scholium Lem.</HI> 11. <HI>Princip.

<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> That the only Effect of the Sublimations, and other Preparations of Mercury, is the dividing it into the&s;e parts of the fir&s;t Compo&s;itioN, which are Spherical, <HI>Per &s;uppo&s;.</HI> 1.

Now be|&s;ides the&s;e divi&s;ions into Spherical Particles, the Saline Bodies which are mix'd with the Mercury in the&s;e Pre|parations keep the&s;e a&s;under and dis|join'd, like &s;o many congeal'd little Bullets &s;eparated by the Fixation of &s;ome Liquor. This is (as I &s;uppo&s;e) the whole effect of the&s;e Preparati|ons; as is evident from what Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> and all other <HI>Chymi&s;ts</HI> have found; to wit, That from all the Tran&s;mutations, and Preparations of Mercury they cou'd elicite the &s;ame
<PB N="101" REF="108">
uniform heavy Fluid; which cou'd ne|ver happen if there were any other (be&s;ides the now mention'd) effect produc'd by the&s;e Preparations: For by what means &s;oever you di&s;&s;olve this congeal'd Seperation, the greater Gravity of Mercury brings its Parti|cles into their former Union, and thereby reduces them into the &s;ame Fluid Quick-&s;ilver. Be&s;ides the&s;e two Suppo&s;itions, it is to be ob&s;erv'd,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the chief Ingredients in Mercurial Preparations are (be&s;ides it &s;elf) common and Armoniack Salts, and their Spirits, the Spirit and Oyl of <HI>Niter, Vitriol</HI> and its Spirit, and the like (which afterward we &s;hall call by the General Name of <HI>Saline Bodies,</HI>) All which (we know) are endued with a va&s;t power to vellicate and &s;timu|late the more &s;en&s;ible parts of Ani|mal Bodies, and (con&s;equently) to produce Vomitings and Purging (of them&s;elves) according to their Quan|tity, and the degrees of their Natural force.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the only effect of repeated Sublimations in the&s;e Preparations, is,
<PB N="102" REF="109">
the divi&s;ion of the Mercury into &s;mal|ler Particles, and the freeing of the&s;e from the Gro&s;&s;er and more Noxious parts of the&s;e <HI>Saline Bodies</HI>; for Mer|cury &s;ublimating more quickly and ea|&s;ily than the&s;e other <HI>Saline Bodies,</HI> mu&s;t in repeated Sublimations have a grea|ter proportion to the <HI>Saline</HI> Mixture than in the fir&s;t Sublimations, and con|&s;equently the &s;ub&s;equent Sublimations mu&s;t have le&s;s of tho&s;e <HI>Saline Bodies</HI> than the <HI>Antecedent,</HI> whereby the Pre|paration will become &s;weeter and le&s;s vellicating.

<P>The&s;e things premis'd, I come to explain,</P>
<P N="2">II. The manner of the Operation of Mercurial Medicines; In perform|ing which, I di&s;tingui&s;h two Ca&s;es. 1. Either the Medicine is taken in|wardly. Or, 2. It is apply'd out|wardly; under which head I compre|hend both Mercurial Inunctions and Pla&s;terings. As to the 1. After the Medicine is taken by the Mouth, it
<PB N="103" REF="110">
de&s;ends into the Stomach, and there the Saline parts of the Compo&s;ition vellicat the <HI>Fibres</HI> thereof, which oc|ca&s;ion tho&s;e Gripes are felt upon the taking the&s;e Medicines: And if the Salin Particles have a con&s;iderable &s;hare in the Compo&s;ition, they &s;o powerfully &s;timulat the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Stomach, as to bring it into the&s;e Contractions which produce Vomit|ing, as has been formerly explain'd: The Mercury it &s;elf, with &s;ome of the remainder of the Saline Particles &s;lip|ing into the <HI>Inte&s;tines,</HI> do likewi&s;e vellicat the&s;e, and occa&s;ion a Gentle Purge; which Effect, tho' it be con|&s;tant (in the fir&s;t days after taking the&s;e Medicines) yet it is never &s;o violent as that of other Purgatives; becau&s;e mo&s;t of it's force is &s;pent in the &s;tomach. Now that both the Vomiting and Purging produc'd by the&s;e Medicines, are owing to the &s;a|line parts of the compo&s;ition, is evi|dent from the nature of Mercury, and the effect produc'd in it by the Chy|mical preparations thereof ju&s;t now explain'd: For Mercury con&s;i&s;ting of
<PB N="104" REF="111">
&s;pherical Particles, and by &s;uch prepa|rations being only divided into the&s;e, of them&s;elves (as being &s;pherical) the&s;e particles cou'd never occa&s;ion the &s;timulatitions, which (as has been formerly &s;hown) are nece&s;&s;ary to pro|duce the&s;e effects. The only thing they can contribute towards them is, that by their exce&s;&s;ive gravity and &s;mallne&s;s they are capable to di&s;&s;olve the Cohe&s;ion of the more vi&s;cuous Fluids of the &s;tomach and <HI>Inte&s;tines</HI> and con&s;equently make them flow more ea&s;ily, when the <HI>Mu&s;cular Fibres</HI> of the&s;e parts are otherwi&s;e brought into contractions. Be&s;ides, we &s;ee that the forementioned effects, are mo&s;tly produc'd by tho&s;e compo&s;itions in which mo&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Saline Bodies</HI> enter. As in the corro&s;ive Sublimate, the White and Yellow Precipitate: But in the others which pa&s;s many Sub|limations, (as the Sweet Sublimate, and the <HI>Panacea Mercurialis</HI>) we judge of their goodne&s;s as they produce lea&s;t of the&s;e effects. I a&s;cribe the Sweating produc'd by a do&s;e of &s;ome of the&s;e compo&s;itions, partly to the
<PB N="105" REF="112">
violence of the Vomitting, and partly to the Saline Particles which enter the compo&s;ition; and that &s;mall &s;alivation, to the Imediate action of the&s;e <HI>Saline Bo|dies</HI> upon the Salivary <HI>Glands,</HI> and not to the Mercury it &s;elf. All the&s;e will be evident to any who have &s;een the &s;udden effects of the&s;e Medi|cines, which have not had &s;ufficient time, neither to enter nor circulate with the Blood, &s;o as to be able to produce the mentioned <HI>Sweating</HI> or &s;a|livation after the ordinary manner.

<P>The Mercury being free'd (by the action of the &s;tomach and the heat of the Liquors contain'd in the &s;ame and in the <HI>Inte&s;tines</HI>) of mo&s;t of the &s;aline part of the compo&s;ition, enters the Blood by the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> and is with it carried about through the Canals
<PB N="106" REF="113">
where either it, or any Liquor (of the Body) generated by it, Flows, (the &s;mall remainder of the&s;e Saline Par|ticles, which adheres to the Mercury after the action of the Stomach and <HI>In|te&s;tines,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ting the propagation of the motion, by the velicating the &s;ides of the Canals) And having the &s;ame Celerity, but a much greater weight, it has con&s;equently a greater force, and produces a &s;tronger <HI>Ictus,</HI> and thereby (when once any con&s;iderable quantity thereof has enter'd the Blood) it (by it's great force and the &s;mallne&s;s of its particles) di&s;olves the unatural Cohe&s;i|ons of all the Liquors, renders them more Fluid, and active, and likewi&s;e digs out all the Ob&s;tructions of the impa&s;&s;able Canals like &s;o many little Bullets &s;hot again&s;t a mud Wall, every little Bullet breaks down a part till the whole be levelled; and this it is the more able to perform, both be|cau&s;e it is exceeding weighty, and makes therefore a greater and more forceable <HI>Ictus,</HI> and becau&s;e it's parti|cles are exceeding &s;mall, and are there|fore to be con&s;ider'd as &s;o many ex|ceeding

And that there are Canals through which the Globules of the Blood cannot freely pa&s;s, we are convinc'd from Micro&s;|copial Experiments. Thus all the Liquors of the Body being attenuated, and con&s;equently their celerity and force rendered greater, and all the Canals &s;cour'd, and render'd pa&s;&s;able, the whole <HI>Glands</HI> of the Body are &s;et a work, and throw out the more noxious and le&s;s Fluid parts of their Liquors (by rea&s;on the particles of the Mercury either di&s;&s;olve, or carry before them all the gro&s;s particles which re&s;i&s;t them) and thereby the Per&s;piration, Urine, Salivation, are encreas'd, the quantity of the Fluids le&s;&s;en'd, and the whole Body emaciat|ed, till there be nothing left but pure and u&s;eful Liquors, and clear and pa&s;|&s;able Canals.

<P>But there is another Effect of Mer|curial Medicines, which is noways to be forgotten; for be&s;ides the&s;e men|tion'd Effects, it di&s;troys that corro|&s;ive Faculty of the Liquors which bur&s;ts the &s;uperficial Ve&s;&s;els, and pro|duces tho&s;e con&s;tant pains, Scabs, Ul|cers, and the like, which we feel; For, &s;uppo&s;ing an Ob&s;truction in any Ve&s;&s;el (either by the corro&s;ivene&s;s or Vi&s;ci|dity of the Liquor, or from &s;ome extrin&s;ick cau&s;e) the Liquor Stag|nates and Coagulates there, and by the force of the fluent part of that Li|quor, and by the Corro&s;ivene&s;s of the &s;tagnated part, the Ve&s;&s;els are Mi&s;e|rably di&s;tended, and their parts dila|cerated, which occa&s;ions con&s;tant pain in that part; or they bur&s;t, and the Liquor putrifying, occa&s;ions a Botch, Scab, or Ulcer, more or le&s;s Danger|ous and painful, as the corro&s;ivene&s;s
<PB N="109" REF="116">
of the &s;tangnated and putrifying Fluid is greater or le&s;&s;er.

<P>But here it may be objected, that the grand effect (as mo&s;t People be|lieve) of Mercurial Medicines is Sali|vation, and that really the Salivary <HI>Glands</HI> &s;ecern more of their Fluid pro|portionally than any other <HI>Glands</HI> of the Body, which is contrary to the 5. <HI>Prop.</HI> about Secretion.

<P N="1"><PB N="110" REF="117">1. That the principal effect of Mer|cury, is the attenuating the Fluids, the clearing the Canals, and the de|&s;troying the Corro&s;ivene&s;s of the Ob&s;tructions, and that &s;alivation has no more title to be the principal ef|fect of Mercury, than in&s;en&s;ible per|&s;piration.

But 3. The rea|&s;on why we &s;eem to &s;ecern more by the &s;alivary <HI>Glands</HI> proportionally than by any or mo&s;t others, are the&s;e, 1.

they &s;ecern more likewi&s;e; and it will be found &s;o when ever the thing is examined after <HI>Sanctorius</HI>'s method; but that &s;ecretion not being vi&s;ible, makes the matter doubted. 2.

The true account of the Matter is this, The <HI>Saliva</HI> be|ing a tough ropy Sub&s;tance, cannot be thru&s;t out &s;o fa&s;t as the Mercury car|ries it forward, e&s;pecially &s;eeing it &s;eperates only the mo&s;t Glutinous
<PB N="112" REF="119">
parts of this <HI>Saliva,</HI> whence all the Salivary <HI>Glands</HI> begin to &s;well untill there be &s;uch a quantity accumulated, as together with the force of the Mercury, and of the &s;ucceeding Fluid is able to bur&s;t the Orifices of the <HI>Glands</HI>: And it is ob&s;ervable, the Sali|vation continues only &s;o long as any of the <HI>Glands</HI> are found &s;well'd. Whence it is evident that this plenti|ful Salivation depends upon this, That the Fluid is as it were laid up in &s;tore to be deriv'd more plentifully after|wards, whereas in the other <HI>Glands,</HI> the Fluid being thiner, is &s;ecern'das fa&s;t as it is driv'n forward: And hence it comes to pa&s;s, that we think the <HI>Saliva</HI> &s;ecern'd, is much greater in Quantity than what is deriv'd from the other <HI>Glands.</HI> If we take in all the&s;e Con&s;iderations together, they will account for the plentiful Salivati|on by Mercury.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the &s;econd Ca&s;e: In Mer|curial Inunctions the vi&s;cid Matter, in which the Quick-&s;ilver is wrought and pounded, &s;erves only to keep the &s;mall Particles thereof &s;eparated and
<PB N="113" REF="120">
a&s;under, and to apply them to the Skin, till by frequent rough Frictions the &s;malle&s;t Particles of the Mercury are forced through the &s;ides of the Cuticular <HI>Arteries</HI> into the Blood, and when once they are got thither they are in the E&s;tate ju&s;t now Mention'd, and operate after the manner already explain'd. And indeed this were the &s;horte&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t cour&s;e of rai&s;ing a <HI>Flux de Bouche,</HI> if Mercury cou'd be adju&s;ted to the Strength and Con&s;ti|tion of the Patient, (for the Quantity of Mercury, which will kill one, will not produce the de&s;ign'd effect of Sa|livation in another) by this Method, as exactly as by Admini&s;tring it gradual|ly in Do&s;es, by the Mouth. But it can|not be done &s;o, and therefore the lat|ter cour&s;e is the more &s;afe.</P>
<P>Mercurial Plai&s;ters apply'd outward|ly to heal Scabs; or inveterate Ulcers, operate thus; The Coro&s;ive &s;aline mix|ture, if there by any part thereof in the Compo&s;ition, eats away and cor|rodes the putrid Matter, which &s;ears up the Mouths of the Ve&s;&s;els; &s;o that the Mercurial Particles get ea&s;ily into
<PB N="114" REF="121">
them, where they both clear the Ve&s;|&s;el of the Ob&s;tructions, and de&s;troy the pointedne&s;s of the Particles of the Fluid, which two things did concur to make the Ulcer &s;ore. If there be no Saline Body in the Application, then the Mercury mu&s;t be forc'd in by Friction, into the Ma&s;s of the Blood, to produce the de&s;ign'd effect.</P>
<P>Thus from a few ea&s;ie and evident <HI>Po&s;tulates,</HI> I have giv'n an intelligible account of the Manner of the Operati|on, and of the Effects of Mercurial Me|dicines, when the Mercury enters in a|ny Quantity into the ma&s;s of the Blood, and from thence it will be ea&s;ily un|der&s;tood, that when the quantity is le&s;s, the Effects will be proportionally le&s;&s;er: Sore that it will be needle&s;s to explain all the &s;everal degrees there|of by detail. But &s;eeing it is evident from <HI>Leuvenhoeck</HI>'s Ob&s;ervations in the la&s;t mention'd <HI>Phil. Tran&s;.</HI> That the force of the Blood is able to wa&s;h away &s;ome Ob&s;tructions: let us take a gro&s;s e&s;timat of the Proportion of the Efficacy of the Blood a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mer|cury, to the Efficacy of the Blood of it &s;elf and una&s;&s;i&s;ted to take a|way
<PB N="115" REF="122">
Ob&s;tructions. Fir&s;t, Then we mu&s;t con&s;ider, if in&s;tead of the ordi|nary Liquors there pa&s;s'd nothing but Mercury in the Canals of the Body, the weight of Blood being to that of Mer|cury, as 1032 to 14593, or as 1 to 13 at lea&s;t, and their Velocities being the &s;ame, Mercury wou'd at lea&s;t be 13 times more able to remove the Ob|&s;truction than the Blood of &s;elf: But it is certain (if the Ob&s;truction ren|ders the Canal impa&s;&s;ible,) there can no Particle of the Mercury get away; and (when there is any quantity there|of got into the Blood) there are &s;till &s;ome new Particles thereof coming up, &s;o that after &s;ome time (they having a greater <HI>Momentum</HI> than the <HI>Globules</HI> of the Blood, and thereby getting through it up to the Ob&s;truction) we may con&s;ider there will be little or no|thing &s;ave Mercurial Particles at, or near the Ob&s;truction, driven again&s;t it, by the whole force of the Blood; So, that as to the Ob&s;truction it &s;elf, it is very near the &s;ame, as if the whole Canals run Mercury. However, let us take the Proportion only as 1 to 10, &s;o that upon this account the Blood
<PB N="116" REF="123">
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by any con&s;iderable quantity of Mercury, will be 10 times more able to remove the Ob&s;truction than the Blood una&s;&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> Let us con&s;ider, the <HI>Globules</HI> of the Blood are Ela&s;tick (for they often lo&s;e their Figure in &s;trait Canals, and recover it again, as <HI>Leuvenhoeck</HI> has &s;hown, which is the Definition of E|la&s;ticity) and tho&s;e of Mercury are not, or very little &s;o: And con&s;e|quently upon this account, the Effica|cy of the <HI>Globules</HI> of Blood will be hugely dimini&s;h'd, Let us &s;uppo&s;e it loo&s;es &frac14; of its Efficacy (which is a liberal allowance) and then the Pro|portion will be &frac34; to 10, or 3 to 40.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly.</HI> Let us ob&s;erve, That the <HI>Globules</HI> of the Blood, and Mercury driven again&s;t the Ob&s;truction, and at every Pul&s;e digging away a part of the &s;ame, may be con&s;idered as <HI>Cunei,</HI> now <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> the Force or Efficacy of <HI>Cunei</HI> is reciprocally proportional to the Angles, their Edges make. But in &s;pheres the le&s;&s;er or greater degree
<PB N="117" REF="124">
of Curvity, is to be con&s;ider'd as the&s;e Angles, when the&s;e &s;pheres are con&s;i|der'd as <HI>Cunei</HI>: And the degrees of Curvity in &s;pheres (as in Circles) are reciprocally as their <HI>Radii.</HI> Suppo&s;ing then the Diameter or <HI>Radius</HI> of a Par|ticle of Mercury is to that of a <HI>Globule</HI> of Blood, as, 1 to 100 (and there can be Rea&s;ons given, &s;ome of which I have formerly hinted, why the Odds may be &s;uppos'd much greater) then the force of the Mercury, and the Blood, to that of the Blood una&s;&s;i&s;ted, to remove Ob&s;tructions, will be as 4000 to 3. La&s;tly, let us con&s;ider, that by the force of the Mercury, the Li|quors of the Body are exceedingly at|tenuated and render'd more moveable, and are thereby capacitated to receive a &s;tronger Impre&s;&s;ion, &s;o that they both move more quickly and with greater force, as is evident from the Pul&s;e of tho&s;e who are under a <HI>Flux de Bouche</HI> who&s;e Pul&s;e is little le&s;s fre|quent and &s;trong, than the Pul&s;e of tho&s;e in a Fever. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the Proportion, both of the frequency of their Pul&s;e, and of its &s;trength to that
<PB N="118" REF="125">
of an ordinary one, as 3 to 2, (and this is certainly much le&s;s than the truth.) Then it will be as 3 to 2 upon the account of its greater force, and again as 3 to 2 upon the account of its greater frequency, that is as 9 to 4. So that now upon this la&s;t, and all the former accounts, the proportion of the Efficacy of the Blood a&s;&s;i&s;ted by any con&s;iderable quantity of Mercury, to that of the Blood una&s;&s;i&s;ted, to re|move an Ob&s;truction, will be as 36000 to 12 or as 3000 to 1. So that the fir&s;t will be 3000 times more effectual for that end than the latter. But if any &s;hou'd &s;till think we have made too li|beral Allowances for the Mercury, let us rebate the Proportion one third part; yet &s;till the Blood a&s;&s;i&s;ted by any con&s;iderable quantity of Mercury will be able to do as much toward the re|moval of an Ob&s;truction in one day, as the Blood una&s;&s;i&s;ted in three years almo&s;t.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there are a great many ca&s;es in which the Blood una&s;&s;i&s;ted, is &s;o far from being able to remove the Ob|&s;truction, that it will continually en|crea&s;e
<PB N="119" REF="126">
the &s;ame: For if the Ob&s;truction proceed from a Depravation of the Liquors of the Body, as in <HI>Rheumati&s;ms,</HI> or if &s;ome corroding matter, be forc'd into the Liquors, &s;o as to be able to vitiate the &s;ame, as in Poxes, Pe&s;ts, and Poi&s;ons, it is demon&s;trable, that (without &s;ome external a&s;&s;i&s;tance, ei|ther by Diet or Medicines) the Malady, in&s;tead of mending by length of time, will encrea&s;e. But if the Ob&s;truction proceed from &s;ome external injury, as in Brui&s;es, Wounds, Colds, and (per|haps all continual) Fevers, the Li|quors (&s;till per&s;i&s;ting in their Natural and Whole&s;ome E&s;tate,) may do much to drive away the &s;ame by length of time; but &s;till the &s;ooner, and more &s;afely if they be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by convenient Medicines. I come to,</P>
<P N="3">III. The Advantage and U&s;efulne&s;s of Mercurial Medicines.</P>
<P N="1">And, 1. They are u&s;eful for de|&s;troying the Vi&s;cidity and Thickne&s;s, the Corro&s;ivene&s;s and Pointedne&s;s, of the Particles of the whole Liquors of the Body, rendring them Fluid and
<PB N="120" REF="127">
moveable, Innocent and Harmle&s;s, if before they were otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. They are evidently u&s;eful for re|moving all Ob&s;tructions, Ulcers, Scabs, Botches, Swellings, con&s;tant Pains, (all which are but the effects of &s;ome kind of Ob&s;truction or other) of what|ever Nature or Kind, by adju&s;ting on|ly their Quantities rightly, but that is the Work of an able Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>Now for an&s;wer to the Que&s;tion which gave occa&s;ion to this Di&s;cour&s;e: Mercurial Medicines were exceeding|ly u&s;eful and wou'd an&s;wer the whole de&s;ign in Curing Fevers, were it not upon the&s;e two Accounts. 1. Before they cou'd be effectual for this purpo&s;e, they ought to be Admini&s;tred in a large quantity, which never mi&s;&s;es (by the violence and force of the Motion of the Blood thereby occa&s;ion'd) to in|duce a new Fever in the Patient of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">|&s;elf, &s;o that in&s;tead of Curing the for|mer Fever, it wou'd double it, and make the danger double, which by no means is to be done; the Patient hav|ing enough a do to wre&s;tle with one. But, 2. It requires &s;o long time to
<PB N="121" REF="128">
bring the effects of Mercurial Reme|dies to any height, that the Patient (in &s;o long a &s;pace) wou'd be Cur'd by the force of Nature, or kill'd by the Vio|lence of the Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o that upon this account they are rendred u&s;ele&s;s. Be|&s;ides there are a Thou&s;and other In|conveniencies which render this Me|thod in its full force, altogether im|practicable.</P>
<P>After all, I remember to have been told (&s;ome time ago) by that Eminent Phy&s;ician of our Countrey, (whom I have thrice already mention'd) That People who have been &s;everely flux'd, &s;eldom fall into dangerous Fevers, and that in Fevers of Children occa&s;i|on'd by Worms, Mercury, if di&s;creet|ly us'd, is always, and in &s;ome Fevers of riper years, is often, very &s;ucce&s;s|ful. The Rea&s;on of both which is very evident from our Doctrine.</P>
<P>For, in tho&s;e who have been &s;evere|ly Flux'd, the Blood is &s;o purify'd, and render'd &s;o Fluid, and all the Ca|nals are &s;o cleans'd and &s;cour'd, that if at any time there &s;hou'd happen
<PB N="122" REF="129">
&s;uch Ob&s;tructions as occa&s;ion Fevers, Nature is able in a &s;hort time to drive them away, &s;eeing they mu&s;t rather happen from &s;ome external cau&s;e, than from within, where all is clear and pa&s;&s;able.</P>
<P>As for Fevers occa&s;ion'd by Worms among the Fluids in the Bodies of young Per&s;ons, (which by the way is an Argument omitted for our Theory of continual Fervers, as is likewi&s;e the <HI>Febris Variolarum,</HI> both which are occa&s;ion'd by Ob&s;tructi|ons, as is evident from the botches which break out upon the latter, and as &s;hall be ju&s;t now &s;hown of the former) For here a little Worm being forc'd into &s;ome of the capil|lary <HI>Arteries,</HI> where it can neither get back nor forward, totally oc|cludes the pa&s;&s;age of the Blood, and thereby occa&s;ions a Fever after the manner already explain'd. Now the Rea&s;on why the natural force of the Blood is not able to remove &s;uch an Ob&s;truction is, becau&s;e a living Creature makes it, which will
<PB N="123" REF="130">
not be mouldred away after the manner of Coagulated Blood; But will require the greater weight and force the Mercury to kill it fir&s;t, and then both the Mercury and Blood concuring, wa&s;h it away.</P>
