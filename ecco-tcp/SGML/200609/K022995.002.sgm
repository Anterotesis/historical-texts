Mr. POPE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE this moment receiv'd the fa|vour
of yours of the 8th in&s;tant; and
will make you a true excu&s;e, (tho' per|haps
no very good one) that I defer'd the
troubling you with a letter, when I &s;ent
back your Papers, in hopes of &s;eeing you
at <HI>Binfield</HI> before this time. If I had met
with any fault in your performance, I
&s;hould freely now (as I have done too pre|&s;umptuou&s;ly
in conver&s;ation with you) tell
<PB N="4" REF="4">
you my opinion; which I have frequently
ventur'd to give you, rather in compliance
with your de&s;ires than that I could think it
rea&s;onable. For I am not yet &s;atisfied upon
what grounds I can pretend to judge of
Poetry, who never have been practic'd in
the Art. There may po&s;&s;ible be &s;ome hap|py
genius's, who may judge of &s;ome of
the natural beauties of a Poem, as a man
may of the proportions of a building,
without having read <HI>Vitruvius,</HI> or knowing
any thing of the rules of architecture: But
this, tho' it may &s;ometimes be in the right,
mu&s;t be &s;ubject to many mi&s;takes, and is
certainly but a &s;uperficial knowledge;
without entring into the art, the methods,
and the particular excellencies of the whole
compo&s;ure, in all the parts of it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides my want of skill I have another
rea&s;on why I ought to &s;u&s;pect my &s;elf, by
rea&s;on of the great affection I have for
you, which might give too much bia&s;s, to
be kind to every thing that comes from
you; but after all, I mu&s;t &s;ay (and I do it
with an old-fa&s;hion'd &s;incerity) that I en|tirely
approve of your Tran&s;lation of tho&s;e
Pieces of <HI>Homer,</HI> both as to the ver&s;ifica|tion
and the true &s;en&s;e that &s;hines thro' the
whole; nay I am confirm'd in my former
application to you, and give me leave to
renew it upon this occa&s;ion, that you
<PB N="5" REF="5">
wou'd proceed in tran&s;lating that incompa|rable
Poet, to make him &s;peak good <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI>
to dre&s;s his admirable characters in
your proper, &s;ignificant, and expre&s;&s;ive con|ceptions,
and to make his works as u&s;eful
and in&s;tructive to this degenerate age, as
he was to our friend <HI>Horace,</HI> when he
read him at <HI>Proene&s;te, Qui, quid &s;it pul|chrum,
quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</HI> &amp;c.
I break off with that <HI>quid non?</HI> with which
I confe&s;s I am charm'd.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter I intreat you to
&s;end this pre&s;ently to be added to the Mi&s;|cellanies,
and I hope it will come time
enough for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I have nothing to &s;ay of my Nephew
B.'s ob&s;ervations, for he &s;ent them to me
&s;o late, that I had not time to con&s;ider
them; I dare &s;ay he endeavour'd very
faithfully (tho' he told me very ha&s;tily) to
execute your commands.</P>
<P>All I can add is, that if your exce&s;s of mo|de&s;ty
&s;hou'd hinder you from publi&s;hing this
<HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> I &s;hall only be &s;orry that I have no

<P>I Send you <HI>Dennis</HI>'s remarks on the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On Critici&s;m.</NOTE> <HI>E&s;|&s;ay,</HI>
which equally abound in ju&s;t Cri|tici&s;ms
and fine Railleries: The few ob&s;er|vations
in my hand in the margins, are
what a mornings lei&s;ure permitted me
to make, purely for your peru&s;al. For I
am of opinion that &s;uch a Critic as you
will find him by the latter part of his
book, is but one way to be properly an|&s;wer'd,
and that way I wou'd not take
after what he informs me in his preface,
that he is at this time per&s;ecuted by For|tune.
This I knew not before; if I had,
his name had been &s;par'd in the E&s;&s;ay,
for that only rea&s;on. I can't conceive
what ground he has for &s;o exce&s;&s;ive a re|&s;entment;
nor imagine how tho&s;e <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>But <HI>Appius</HI> reddens at each word you &s;peak,</L> <L>And &s;tares tremendous with a threatning eye,</L> <L>Like &s;ome fierce Tyrant in old Tape&s;try.</L></Q></NOTE> three
lines can be call'd a reflection on his <HI>Per|&s;on,</HI>
which only de&s;cribe him &s;ubject a little
to Anger on &s;ome occa&s;ions. I have heard
of combatants &s;o very furious, as to fall
<PB N="7" REF="7">
down them&s;elves with that very blow which
they de&s;ign'd to lay heavy on their anta|goni&s;ts.
But if Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s rage proceeds
only from a zeal to di&s;courage young and
unexperienc'd writers from &s;cribling, he
&s;hou'd frighten us with his Ver&s;e not Pro&s;e:
for I have often known, that when all
the precepts in the world would not re|claim
a &s;inner, &s;ome very &s;ad example has
done the bu&s;ine&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Thought we find afterwards put into Ver&s;e in the <HI>Dunciad, Book</HI> 1.</NOTE>. Yet to give this man
his due, he has objected to one or two
lines with rea&s;on, and I will alter 'em in
ca&s;e of another edition; I will make my
enemy do me a kindne&s;s where he meant
an injury, and &s;o &s;erve in&s;tead of a friend.
What he ob&s;erves at the bottom of page
20th of his reflections, was objected to by
your &s;elf, and had been mended but for
the ha&s;te of the pre&s;s: 'Tis right <HI>Hiber|nian,</HI>
and I confe&s;s it what the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> call
a <HI>Bull</HI> in the expre&s;&s;ion, tho' the &s;en&s;e be
manife&s;t enough: Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s Bulls are
&s;eldom in the expre&s;&s;ion, they are always
in the &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall certainly never make the lea&s;t
reply to him, not only becau&s;e you advi&s;e
me, but becau&s;e I have ever been of opi|nion,
that if a book can't an&s;wer for it&s;elf
<PB N="8" REF="8">
to the publick, 'tis to no &s;ort of purpo&s;e
for its author to do it. If I am wrong in
any &s;entiment of that E&s;&s;ay, I prote&s;t &s;in|cerely,
I don't de&s;ire all the world &s;hould
be deceiv'd (which wou'd be of very ill
con&s;equence) meerly that I my &s;elf may be
thought right, (which is of very little con|&s;equence).
I'd be the fir&s;t to recant, for
the benefit of others, and the glory of my
&s;elf; for (as I take it) when a man owns
him&s;elf to have been in an error, he does
but tell you in other words, that he is wi&s;er
than he was. But I have had an advan|tage
by the publi&s;hing that book of <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s</HI>'s
which otherwi&s;e I &s;hould never have
known: It has been the occa&s;ion of ma|king
me friends, and open abetters, of &s;e|veral
gentlemen of known &s;en&s;e and wit;
and of proving to me what I have till
now doubted, that my writings are taken
&s;ome notice of by the world in general,
or I &s;hould never be attack'd thus in par|ticular.
I have read that 'twas a cu&s;tom
among the <HI>Romans,</HI> while a General rode
in triumph, to have common &s;oldiers in
the &s;treets that rail'd at him and reproach'd
him; to put him in mind, that tho' his
&s;ervices were in the main approved and
rewarded, yet he had faults enough to keep
him humble.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9">
You will &s;ee by this, that whoever &s;ets
up for wit in the&s;e days ought to have the
con&s;tancy of a primitive chri&s;tian, and be
prepar'd to &s;uffer martyrdom in the cau&s;e
of it. But &s;ure this is the fir&s;t time that
a Wit was attack'd for his <HI>Religion,</HI> as you'll
find I am mo&s;t zealou&s;ly in this treati&s;e:
and you know Sir, what alarms I have had
from the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the en&s;uing Letters.</NOTE> oppo&s;ite &s;ide on this account.
Have I not rea&s;on to cry out with the poor
fellow in <HI>Virgil,</HI>
<Q><L>Quid jam mi&s;ero mihi denique re&s;tat?</L>
<L>Cui neque apud <HI>Danaos</HI> u&s;quam locus, &amp; &s;uper
ip&s;i</L>
<L><HI>Dardanidae</HI> infen&s;i poenas cum Sanguine po&s;|cunt!</L></Q></P>
<P>'Tis however my happine&s;s that you, Sir,
are impartial,
<Q><L><HI>Jove</HI> was alike to <HI>Latian</HI> and to <HI>Phrygian,</HI></L>
<L>For you well know, that Wit's of no Religion.</L></Q></P>
<P>The manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> which Mr. <HI>D.</HI> takes to
pieces &s;everal particular lines, detach'd from
their natural places, may &s;hew how ea&s;y
it is to a caviller to give a new &s;en&s;e, or
<PB N="10" REF="10">
a new non&s;ence to any thing. And in|deed
his con&s;tructions are not more wre&s;t|ed
from the genuine meaning, than theirs
who objected to the heterodox parts, as they
call'd 'em.</P>
<P>Our friend the <HI>Abb&egrave;</HI> is not of that &s;ort,
who with the utmo&s;t candour and free|dom,
has mode&s;tly told me what others
thought, and &s;hewn him&s;elf one (as he
very well expre&s;&s;es it) rather of a <HI>Number</HI>
than a <HI>Party.</HI> The only difference between
us in relation to the Monks, is, that he
thinks mo&s;t &s;orts of learning flouri&s;h'd a|mong
'em, and I am of opinion that only
&s;ome &s;ort of learning was barely kept alive
by 'em: he believes, that in the mo&s;t na|tural
and obvious &s;en&s;e, that line (<HI>A &s;econd
deluge Learning over-run</HI>) will be under|&s;tood
of Learning in general; and I fancy
'twill be under&s;tood only (as 'tis meant) of
polite Learning, Critici&s;m, Poetry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which
is the only learning concern'd in the &s;ubject
of the E&s;&s;ay. It is true, that the <HI>Monks</HI>
did pre&s;erve what learning there was about
<HI>Nicholas</HI> the Fifth's time; but tho&s;e who
&s;ucceeded fell into the depth of Barba|rism,
or at lea&s;t &s;tood at a &s;tay while others
ro&s;e from thence, in&s;omuch that even <HI>Era&s;|mus</HI>
and <HI>Reuchlin</HI> could hardly laugh them
out of it. I am highly oblig'd to the <HI>Ab|be</HI>'s
zeal in my commendation, and good|ne&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="11">
in not concealing what he thinks my
error. And his te&s;tifying &s;ome e&s;teem for
the book, ju&s;t at a time when his brethren
rais'd a clamour again&s;t it, is an in&s;tance
of great genero&s;ity and candor, which I

<P>IN your la&s;t you informed me of the
mi&s;taken zeal of &s;ome people, who
&s;eem to make no le&s;s their bu&s;ine&s;s to
per&s;uade men they are erroneous, than Do|ctors
do that they are &s;ick; only that they
may magnify their own cure, and triumph
over an imaginary di&s;temper. The Simile
objected to in my E&s;&s;ay.<Q><L>(Thus wit, like faith, by each man is apply'd</L>
<L>To one &s;mall Sect, and all are damn'd be&s;ide.)</L></Q> Plainly concludes at this &s;econd line, where

(which is meant by <HI>that ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> and <HI>that
&s;un</HI>) for how can the &s;un of <HI>faith</HI> be &s;aid
<PB N="12" REF="12">
to <HI>&s;ublime the &s;outhern wits,</HI> and to <HI>ripen the
genius's of the northern climates?</HI> I fear the&s;e
gentlemen under&s;tand grammer as little as
they do critici&s;im; and perhaps out of good
nature to the Monks, are willing to take
from 'em the cen&s;ure of ignorance, and to
have it to them&s;elves. The word <HI>They</HI>
refers (as I am &s;ure I meant, and as I
thought every one mu&s;t have known) to
tho&s;e critics there &s;poken of, who are par|tial
to &s;ome perticular &s;ett of writers, to
the prejudice of all others. And the very
&s;imile it &s;elf, if twice read, may convince
them, that the cen&s;ure here of damning
lies not on our Church at all, unle&s;s they
call our Church <HI>one &s;mall Sect</HI> and the
cautious words, (<HI>by each man</HI>) manife&s;tly
&s;how it a general reflection on all &s;uch
(whoever they are) who entertain tho&s;e
narrow rnd limited notions of the mercy
of the Almighty; which the Reform'd mi|ni&s;ters
and Presbyterians are as guilty of as
any people living.</P>
<P>Yet after all, I promi&s;e you Sir, if the
alteration of a word or two will gratify any
man of &s;ound faith tho' weak under&s;tand|ing,
I will (tho' it were from no other
principal than that of common good na|ture)
comply with it. And if you plea&s;e
but to particularize the &s;pot where their
objection lies, (for it is in a very narrow
<PB N="13" REF="13">
compa&s;s) that &s;tumbling-block, tho' it be
but a little pebble, &s;hall be removed out
of their way. If the heat of the&s;e good
di&s;putants (who I am afraid being bred up
to wrangle in the &s;chools, cannot get rid
of the humor all their lives) &s;hou'd pro|ceed
&s;o far as to per&s;onal reflections upon
me, I a&s;&s;ure you notwith&s;tanding I will
do, or &s;ay nothing, however provok'd (for
&s;ome people can no more provoke than
oblige) that is unbecoming the character
of a true Catholick. I will &s;et before me
the example of that great man, and great
Saint <HI>Era&s;mus</HI>; who in the mid&s;t of ca|lumny
proceeded with all the calmne&s;s of
innocence, and the unrevenging &s;pirit of
primitive chri&s;tianity. However I wou'd
advi&s;e them to &s;uffer the mention of <HI>him</HI>
to pa&s;s unregarded, le&s;t I &s;hou'd be forc'd
to do that for his reputation which I
wou'd never do for my own; I mean, to
vindicate &s;o great a light of our Church
from the malice of pa&s;t times, and the ig|norance
of the pre&s;ent, in a language which
the Trifle about Critici&s;m is writen. I wi&s;h
the&s;e gentlemen wou'd be contented with
finding fault with me only, who will &s;ub|mit
to 'em right or wrong, as far as I on|ly
am concern'd; I have a greater regard
to the quiet of mankind than to di&s;turb it
<PB N="14" REF="14">
for things of &s;o little con&s;equence as my
credit and my &s;en&s;e. A little humility can
do a Poet no hurt, and a little Charity
wou'd do a Prie&s;t none: For as St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>

<P>THE concern which you more than
&s;eem to be affected with for my
reputation, by the &s;everal accounts you have
&s;o obligingly given of what reports and
cen&s;ures the holy Vandals have thought fit
to pa&s;s upon me, makes me de&s;irous of
telling &s;o good a friend my whole thoughts
of this matter; and of &s;etting before you
in a clear light the true &s;tate of it.</P>
<P>I have ever believ'd the be&s;t piece of
&s;ervice one cou'd do to our religion, was
openly to expre&s;s our dete&s;tation and &s;corn
of all tho&s;e mean artifices and <HI>Pioe fraudes,</HI>
which it &s;tands &s;o little in need of, and
which have laid it under &s;o great a &s;can|dal
among&s;t its enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15">
Nothing has been &s;o much a &s;carecrow
to them, as that too peremptory and &s;eem|ingly-uncharitable
a&s;&s;ertion of an utter <HI>Im|po&s;&s;ibility</HI>
of <HI>Salvation</HI> to all but our&s;elves;
<HI>invincible</HI> ignorance excepted, which in|deed
&s;ome people define under &s;o great li|mitations
and with &s;uch exclu&s;ions, that
it &s;eems as if that word were rather in|vented
as a &s;alvo, or expedient, not to be
thought too bold with the thunder-bolts
of God (which are hurl'd about &s;o freely
on almo&s;t all mankind by the hands of
eccle&s;ia&s;ticks) than as a real exception to
almo&s;t-univer&s;al damnation. For be&s;ides
the &s;mall number of the truly faithful in
our Church, we mu&s;t again &s;ubdivide;
the <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;t</HI> is damn'd by the <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> the
<HI>Je&s;uit</HI> by the <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Scoti&s;t</HI> by the
<HI>Thomi&s;t,</HI> and &s;o forth.</P>
<P>There may be Errors I grant, but I can't
think'em of &s;uch con&s;equenceas to de&s;troy
utterly the charity of mankind; the very
greate&s;t bond in which we are ingag'd by
God to one another. Therefore I own to
you, I was glad of any opportunity to ex|pre&s;s
my di&s;like of &s;o &s;hocking a &s;entiment
as tho&s;e of the religion I profe&s;s are com|monly
charg'd with; and I hop'd, a &s;light
in&s;inuation, introduc'd &s;o ea&s;ily by a ca|&s;ual
&s;imilitude only, cou'd never have gi|ven
offence; but on the contrary mu&s;t
<PB N="16" REF="16">
needs have done good; in a nation and
time, wherein we are the &s;maller party
and con&s;equently mo&s;t mi&s;repre&s;ented, and
mo&s;t in need of vindication.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, I took occa&s;ion to
mention the <HI>Super&s;tition</HI> of &s;ome ages after
the &s;ubver&s;ion of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> which
is too manife&s;t a truth to be deny'd, and
does in no &s;ort reflect upon the pre&s;ent
profe&s;&s;ors of our faith who are free from
it. Our &s;ilence in the&s;e points may with
&s;ome rea&s;on make our adver&s;aries think we
allow and per&s;i&s;t in tho&s;e biggotries; which
yet in reality all good and &s;en&s;ible Men
de&s;pi&s;e, tho' they are per&s;uaded not to
&s;peak again&s;t 'em; I can't tell why, &s;ince
now, 'tis no way the intere&s;t even of the
wor&s;t of our Prie&s;thood (as it might have
been then) to have them &s;mother'd in &s;i|lence:
For as the oppo&s;ite Sects are now
prevailing, 'tis too late to hinder our Church
from being &s;lander'd; 'tis our bu&s;ine&s;s now
to &s;how it is &s;lander'd unju&s;tly, and to
vindicate our &s;elves from being thought
abettors of what they charge us with.
This can't &s;o well be brought about with
&s;erious faces; we mu&s;t laugh with them
at what de&s;erves it; and then we need not
doubt of being clear'd, ev'n in their opi|nions.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="17">
As to particulars; you cannot but have
ob&s;erv'd that at fir&s;t the whole objection
again&s;t the &s;imile of wit and faith lay to
the word <HI>They</HI>: When that was beyond
contradiction removed (the very Grammar
&s;erving to confute 'em) then the objection
lies again&s;t the <HI>Simile it&s;elf</HI>; or if that &s;i|mile
will not be objected to (&s;en&s;e and
common rea&s;on being indeed a little &s;tub|born,

mu&s;t become a crime (as if <HI>Religion</HI> and

fault (if he has any) is not want of

his reputation a By-way, and not openly
to object to the place they are really gall'd

whom their tribe oppre&s;s'd and per&s;ecuted
&s;hou'd be vindicated after an age of ob|loquy
by one of their own people, willing
to utter an hone&s;t truth in behalf of the
dead, whom no man &s;ure will flatter,
and to whom few will do ju&s;tice. Others,
you know were as angry that I mention'd
Mr. <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> with honour who as he never
refus'd to any one of merit of any party
the prai&s;e due to him, &s;o hone&s;tly de&s;erv'd
it from all others, tho' of ever &s;o diffe|rent
intere&s;ts or &s;entiments. May I be
ever guilty of this &s;ort of liberty, and la|titude
of principle! which gives us the
hardine&s;s of &s;peaking well of tho&s;e whom
envy oppre&s;&s;es ev'n after death. As I
wou'd always &s;peak well of my living
friends when they are ab&s;ent, nay becau&s;e

they are ab&s;ent; &s;o would I much more

nothing made a more ridiculous figure

than old age to the &s;haking down this

is a &s;ort of early old age; it teaches us a
diffidence in our earthly &s;tate and in&s;pires
us with the thoughts of a future, better
than a thou&s;and volumes of philo&s;iphers

to tho&s;e props of our vanity, our
&s;trength and youth, that we think of for|tifying
our our &s;elves within, when there is &s;o
little dependance upon our out-works.
Youth at the very be&s;t is but a betrayer
of human life in a gentler and &s;moother
manner than age: 'Tis like a &s;tream that
nouri&s;hes a plant upon a bank, and cau&s;es
it to flouri&s;h and blo&s;&s;om to the &s;ight, but
at the &s;ame time is undermining it at the
root in &s;ecret. My youth has dealt more
fairly and openly with me, it has afforded
&s;everal Pro&s;pects of my danger, and given
me an advantage not very common to
young men, that the attractions of the
<PB N="31" REF="31">
world have not dazzle me very much;
and I begin where mo&s;t people end, with
a full conviction of the emptine&s;s of all
&s;orts of ambition, and the un&s;atisfactory
nature of all human plea&s;ure. When a
&s;mart fit of &s;ickne&s;s tells me this &s;curvy
tenement of my body will fall in a little
time, I am e'en as unconcern'd as was that
hone&s;t <HI>Hiberniam,</HI> who being in bed in the
great &s;torm &s;ome years ago, and told the
hou&s;e would tumble over his head, made
an&s;wer, What care I for the hou&s;e? I
am only a lodger. I fancy 'tis the be&s;t
time todie when one is in the be&s;t hu|mour,
and &s;o exce&s;&s;ively weak as I now
am I may &s;ay with con&s;cience, that I am
not at all unea&s;y at the thought that ma|ny
men whome I never had any e&s;teem
for, are likely to enjoy this world after me.
When I reflect what an incon&s;iderable little
attom every &s;ingle man is, with re&s;pect to
the whole creation, methinks 'tis a &s;hame
to be concern'd at the removal of &s;uch a
trivial animal as I am. The morning af|ter
my Exit, the &s;un will ri&s;e as bright as

&s;pring as green, the world will proceed in
its old cour&s;e, people will laugh as hear|tily,

little uncharitable, (<Q REND="inline">"that he might fear

that diminutives are as often in the <HI>Latin</HI>

<P>YOU have at length comply'd with
the reque&s;t I have often made you,
for you have &s;hown me, I mu&s;t confe&s;s,
&s;everal of my faults in the &s;ight of tho&s;e

<PB N="39" REF="39">
many things that would give me &s;hame,
if I were not more de&s;irous to be thought
hone&s;t than prudent: &s;o many things freely
thrown out, &s;uch lengths of unre&s;erv'd
friend&s;hip, thoughts ju&s;t warm from the
brain, without any poli&s;hing or dre&s;s, the
very di&s;habille of the under&s;tanding. You
have prov'd your &s;elf more tender of an|other's
embroyo's than the fonde&s;t mothers
are of their own, for you have pre&s;erv'd
every thing that I mi&s;carry'd of. Since I

afraid of writing to you than ever, at this
carele&s;s rate, becau&s;e I &s;ee my evil works
may again ri&s;e in judgment again&s;t me:
Yet in another re&s;pect I &s;hall be le&s;s afraid,
&s;ince this has given me &s;uch a proof of
the extreme indulgence you afford to my
&s;lighte&s;t thoughts. The revi&s;al of the&s;e let|ters
has been a kind of examination of
con&s;cience to me; &s;o fairly and faithfully
have I &s;et down in 'em from time to time
the true and undi&s;tingui&s;h'd &s;tate of my
mind. But I find that the&s;e, which were
intended as sketches of my friend&s;hip, give
as imperfect images of it, as the little
land&s;capes we commonly &s;ee in black
and white, do of a beautiful country;
they can repre&s;ent but a very &s;mall part
of it, and that depriv'd of the life and lu&s;tre
of nature. I perceive that the more I en|deavour'd

to render manife&s;t the real affe|ction

but injure it by repre&s;enting le&s;s and le&s;s
of it: as gla&s;&s;es which are de&s;ign'd to make
an object very clear, generally contract
it. Yet as when people have a full
idea of a thing, fir&s;t, upon their own

refre&s;h the Remembrance, and are not di&s;|plea&s;ing

you had of my e&s;teem for you,
is the rea&s;on that you do not di&s;like my
letters.</P>
<P>They will not be of any great &s;ervice
(I find) in the de&s;ign I mentioned to you:
I believe I had better &s;teal from a richer

have kept as carefully as I would Letters

more value than titles of honour.) You
have &s;ome cau&s;e to apprehend this u&s;age
from me, if what &s;ome &s;ay be true, that
I am a great Borrower; however I have
hitherto had the luck that none of my
creditors have challeng'd me for it: and
tho&s;e who &s;ay it are &s;uch, who&s;e writings
no man ever borrow'd from, &s;o have the
lea&s;t rea&s;on to complain: Their works are
granted on all hands to be but too much

other men: I verily believe theirs were ne|ver
corrected by any man: But indeed if
mine have not, 'twas not my fault, I have
endeavour'd my utmo&s;t that they &s;hould.

<P>THough any thing you write is &s;ure

own your la&s;t letter made me unea&s;y: You
really u&s;e a &s;tyle of compliment, which I
expect as little as I de&s;erve it. I know 'tis
a common opinion that a young &s;cribler
is as ill pleas'd to hear truth as a young
Lady. From the moment one &s;ets up for
an author, one mu&s;t be treated as ceremo|niou&s;ly,
that is as unfaithfully,
<Q>As a King's Favourite, or as a King.</Q>
This proceeding, join'd to that natural va|nity
which fir&s;t makes a man an author,
is certainly enough to render him a cox|comb
for life. But I mu&s;t grant it is but
a ju&s;t judgement upon Poets, that they who&s;e
chief pretence is Wit, &s;hou'd be treated ju&s;t
as they them&s;elves treat Fools, that is, be
cajoll'd with prai&s;es. And I believe, Poets
are the only poor fellows in the world
whom any body will flatter.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="44">
I would not be thought to &s;ay this as if
the obliging letter you &s;ent me de&s;erv'd this

<P>As to the wonderful di&s;coveries, and
all the good news you are pleas'd to

are in the Secret treat common news,
groundle&s;s reports of things at a di&s;tance
which I who look into the true &s;prings of the
affair at home, in my own brea&s;t, know to
have no foundation at all. For <HI>Fame</HI> tho' it

as to warrant our lo&s;s of time here:
It can never make up lie down contentedly
on a death-bed (as &s;ome of the ancients
are &s;aid to have done with that thought).
You Sir have your &s;elf taught me, that an
ea&s;y &s;ituation at that hour, can proceed
from no ambition le&s;s noble than that of
an eternal felicity, which is unattainable by
the &s;tronge&s;t endeavours of the Wit, but
may be gain'd by the &s;incere intentions of
the Heart only. As in the next world,
&s;o in this, the only &s;olid ble&s;&s;ings are owing
to the goodne&s;s of the mind, not the ex|tent
<PB N="45" REF="45">
of the capacity: Friend&s;hip here is an
emanation from the &s;ame &s;ource as Beati|tude
there: the &s;ame benevolence and grate|ful
di&s;po&s;ition that qualifies us for the one,
if extended farther, makes us partakers of

&s;ociety and good-will of worthy men, which
I look upon as no ill earne&s;t and fore-ta&s;te

<P>I Have receiv'd your letter, and am glad

not but the Pro&s;e will require as much

<P>You gave me leave once to take the
liberty of a friend, in advi&s;ing you not to
content your &s;elf with one half of the

<P>YOUR la&s;t is the more obliging, as it
hints at &s;ome little niceties in my
conduct, which your candor and affection
prompt you to recommend to me, and
which (&s;o trivial as things of this nature
&s;eem) are vet of no &s;light con&s;equence, to
people whom every body talks of, and
every body as he plea&s;es. 'Tis a &s;ort of
Tax that attends an e&s;tate in <HI>Parna&s;|&s;us,</HI>
which is often rated much higher
than in proportion to the &s;mall po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
an author holds. For indeed an au|thor
who is once come upon the town,
is enjoy'd without being thank'd for the
plea&s;ure, and &s;ometimes ill-treated by tho&s;e
very per&s;ons that fir&s;t debauch'd him. Yet
to tell you the bottom of my heart, I
am no way di&s;pleas'd that I have offend|ed
the violent of all Parties already; and
at the &s;ame time I a&s;&s;ure you con&s;cien|tiou&s;ly,
I feel not the lea&s;t malevolence
or re&s;entment again&s;t any of tho&s;e who
mi&s;repre&s;ent me, or are di&s;&s;atisfied with
me. This frame of mind is &s;o ea&s;y, that
I am perfectly content with my condi|tion</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="53">
As I hope and would flatter my &s;elf,
that you know me and my thoughts &s;o
entirely as never to be mi&s;taken in either,
&s;o 'tis a plea&s;ure to me that you gue&s;s'd &s;o
right in regard to the Author of that
<HI>Guardian</HI> you mention'd. But I am &s;orry
to find it has taken air that I have &s;ome
hand in tho&s;e Papers, becau&s;e I write &s;o
very few as neither to de&s;erve the credit of
&s;uch a report with &s;ome people, nor the
di&s;repute of it with others. An hone&s;t
<HI>Jacobite</HI> &s;poke to me the &s;en&s;e or non-&s;en&s;e
of the weak part of his Party ve|ry
fairly, that the good people took it
ill of me, that I writ with <HI>Steele,</HI> tho'
upon never &s;o indifferent &s;ubjects&mdash;This I know you will laugh at as well as I
do: yet I doubt not but many little ca|lumniators
and per&s;ons of &s;ower di&s;po&s;i|tions
will take occa&s;ion hence to be&s;patter
me. I confe&s;s I &s;corn narrow &s;ouls, of all
parties, and if I renounce my rea&s;on in
religious matters, I'll hardly do it in any
other.</P>
<P>I can't imagine whence it comes to pa&s;s
that the few <HI>Guardians</HI> I have written are
&s;o generally known for mine: that in par|ticular
which you mention I never di&s;co|ver'd
to any man but the publi&s;her, till ve|ry
lately: yet almo&s;t every body I met told
me of it.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="54">
The true rea&s;on that Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> laid down
the Paper, was a quarrel between him and
<HI>Jacob Ton&s;on.</HI> He &s;tood ingag'd to his
book&s;eller, in articles of Penalty, for all
the <HI>Guardians:</HI> and by de&s;i&s;ting two days
and altering the title of the paper to that
of the <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> was quit of his obliga|tion:
the&s;e papers being printed by <HI>Buck|ley.</HI></P>
<P>As to his taking a more Politick turn, I
cannot any way enter into that &s;ecret, nor
have I been let into it, any more than into
the re&s;t of his politicks. Tho' 'tis &s;aid, he
will take into the&s;e papers al&s;o &s;everal &s;ub|jects
of the politer kind, as before: But I
a&s;&s;ure you as to my &s;elf, I have quite done
with 'em, for the future. The little I
have done, and the great re&s;pect I bear
Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> as a Man of Wit, has render'd
me a &s;u&s;pected Whig to &s;ome of the vio|lent,
but (as old <HI>Dryden</HI> &s;aid before me)
'Tis not the Violent I de&s;ign to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I generally employ the mornings in paint|ing

The be&s;t way I know of overco|ming
Calumny and Mi&s;con&s;truction, is by
a vigorous per&s;everance in every thing we
know to be right, and a total neglect of
all that can en&s;ue from it. 'Tis partly
from this maxim that I depend upon your
friend&s;hip, becau&s;e I believe it will do ju|&s;tice

<P>I Have been lying in wait for my own
imagination, this week and more, and
watching what thoughts came up in
the whirl of the fancy, that were worth
communicating to you in a letter. But I
am at length convinc'd that my rambling
head can produce nothing of that &s;ort; &s;o
I mu&s;t e'en be contented with telling you

would rather you &s;hould pardon me than
e&s;teem me, &s;ince one is an act of goodne&s;s

<P>You can't wonder my thoughts are &s;carce
con&s;i&s;tent, when I tell you how they are
di&s;tracted. Ev'ry hour of my life, my

I am above the &s;tars, with a thou&s;and
&s;y&s;tems round about me, looking forward
into a va&s;t Aby&s;s, and lo&s;ing my whole

mighty Incon&s;i&s;tency! Sickne&s;s and Pain is
the lot of one half of us; Doubt and Fear
the portion of the other! What a bu&s;tle we
make about pa&s;&s;ing our time, when all our
&s;pace is but a point? What aims and am|bitions
are crowded into this little in&s;tant

whole extent of Being no more, in the

us, are yet as long-lived and po&s;&s;e&s;s as wide

him with an eye to all Space, and all
Eternity. Who knows what plots, what
atchievements a mite may perform in his
kingdom of a grain of du&s;t, within his life
of &s;ome minutes? and of how much le&s;s

<P>YOur letter found me very bu&s;y in my
grand undertaking, to which I mu&s;t
wholly give my &s;elf up for &s;ome time, un|le&s;s
when I &s;natch an hour to plea&s;e my
&s;elf with a di&s;tant conver&s;ation with you
<PB N="59" REF="59">
and a few others, by writing. 'Tis no com|fortable
pro&s;pect to be reflecting, that &s;o
long a &s;iege as that of <HI>Troy</HI> lies upon my
hands, and the campagne above half over,
before I have made any progre&s;s, Indeed
the <HI>Greek</HI> fortification upon a nearer ap|proach
does not appear &s;o formidable as it
did, and I am almo&s;t apt to flatter my &s;elf,
that <HI>Homer</HI> &s;ecretly &s;eems inclin'd to a cor|re&s;pondence
with me, in letting me into
a good part of his intentions. There are
indeed, a &s;ort of underling auxiliars to the
difficulty of a work, call'd Commentators
and Critics, who wou'd frighten many peo|ple
by their number and bulk, and perplex
our progre&s;s under pretence of fortifying
their author. The&s;e lie very low in the
trenches and ditches they them&s;elves have
digg'd, encompa&s;s'd with dirt of their own
heaping up, but I think there may be
found a method of coming at the main
works by a more &s;peedy and gallant way
than by mining under ground, that is, by
u&s;ing the Poetical Engines, Wings, and fly|ing
over their heads.</P>
<P>While I am engag'd in the fight, I find
you are concern'd how I &s;hall be paid, and
are &s;ollicitous that I may not have the ill
fate of many di&s;carded Generals, to be fir&s;t
envy'd and malign'd, then perhaps prais'd,
and la&s;tly neglected. The former (the con|&s;tant
<PB N="60" REF="60">
attendant upon all great and lau|dable
enterprizes) I have already experi|enc'd.
Some have &s;aid I am not a Ma&s;ter
in the <HI>Greek,</HI> who either are &s;o them&s;elves
or are not: If they are not, they can't
tell; and if they are, they can't without
having catechiz'd me. But if they can
read (for I know &s;ome Critics can, and
others cannot) there are fairly lying be|fore
them &s;ome &s;pecimens of my tran|&s;lation
from this Author in the <HI>Mi&s;cel|lanics,</HI>
which they are heartily welcome
to. I have met with as much malignity
another way, &s;ome calling me a Tory,
becau&s;e the heads of that party have been
di&s;tingui&s;hingly favourable to me; &s;ome
a Whig becau&s;e I have been favour'd with
yours, Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI>'s, and Mr. <HI>Craggs</HI> his
friend&s;hip, and of late with my Lord <HI>Hal|lifax</HI>'s
Patronage. How much more natu|ral
a conclu&s;ion might be form'd, by any
good-natur'd man, that a per&s;on who has
been well us'd by all &s;ides, has been offen|&s;ive
to none. This mi&s;erable age is &s;o &s;unk
between animo&s;ities of Party and tho&s;e of
Religion, that I begin to fear, mo&s;t men
have politicks enough to make (thro' vio|lence)
the be&s;t Scheme of Government a
bad one; and faith enough to hinder their
own Salvation. I hope for my own part,
never to have more of either than is con|&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="61" REF="61">
with common ju&s;tice and charity, and
always as much as becomes a chri&s;tian and

me one evening at <HI>Button</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e (as

a Cabal with Dean <HI>Swift</HI> and others to
write again&s;t the <HI>Whig-Intere&s;t,</HI> and in par|ticular
to undermine his own reputation,
and that of his friends <HI>Steel</HI> and <HI>Addi&s;on.</HI>
But Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> never open'd his lips to
my face, on this or any like occa&s;ion,
tho' I was almo&s;t every night in the &s;ame
room with him, nor ever offer'd me any
indecorum. Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> came to me a
night or two after <HI>Philips</HI> had talk'd in
this idle manner, and a&s;&s;ur'd me of his di&s;|belief
of what had been &s;aid, of the friend|&s;hip
we &s;hould always maintain, and de|&s;ir'd
I would &s;ay nothing further of it.
My Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> did me the honour to
&s;tir in this matter, by &s;peaking to &s;everal
people to obviate a fal&amp;&s;e a&s;per&s;ion, which
might have done me no &s;mall prejudice

he could, &s;ecretly to continue the report
with the <HI>Hanover</HI> Club, and kept in his
hands the Sub&s;criptions paid for me to him,
as Secretary to that Club. The heads of it
have &s;ince given him to under&s;tand, that
they take it ill; but (upon the terms I
ought to be with a man whom I think a
&s;coundrel) I wou'd not even ask him for
this money, but commi&s;&s;ion'd one of the
<HI>Players,</HI> his equals, to receive it. This is
the whole matter; but as to the &s;ecret
grounds of <HI>Philips</HI>'s malignity, they will
make a very plea&s;ant Hi&s;tory when we
meet. Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> and &s;ome others have
been much diverted with it, and mo&s;t of
the Gentlemen of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Club have
made it the &s;ubject of their ridicule on their

am daily more and more convinc'd of; and
indeed I have for &s;ome years pa&s;t, look'd
upon all of 'em no better than amu&s;ements.
To make them the ultimate end of our
pur&s;uit, is a mi&s;erable and &s;hort ambition,
which will drop from us at ev'ry little di&s;|appointment
here, and even in ca&s;e of no
di&s;appointments here, will infallibly de&s;ert
us hereafter. The utmo&s;t fame they are
capable of be&s;towing, is never worth the
pains they co&s;t us, and the time they lo&s;e
us. If you attain the top of your de&s;ires
that way, all tho&s;e who envy you will do
you harm; and of tho&s;e who admire you,
few will do you good. The un&s;ucce&s;sful
writers are your declared enemies, and pro|bably
the &s;ucce&s;sful your &s;ecret ones: For
tho&s;e hate not more to be excell'd, than
the&s;e to be rivall'd. And at the up&s;hot,
after a life of perpetual application, to re|flect
that you have been doing nothing for
your &s;elf, and that the &s;ame or le&s;s In|du&s;try
might have gain'd you a Friend&s;hip
that can never deceive or end, a &s;atisfaction
which praise cannot be&s;tow, nor vanity feel,
and a glory which (tho' in one re&s;pect like
&s;ame, not to be had 'till after death,) yet
<PB N="68" REF="68">
&s;hall be felt and enjoy'd to eternity. The&s;e,
dear Sir, are unfeignedly my &s;entiments,
whenever I think at all; for half the things
that employ our heads de&s;erve not the name
of thoughts, they are only &s;tronger dreams
or impre&s;&s;ions upon the imagination: Our
&s;chemes of government, our &s;y&s;tems of phi|lo&s;ophy,
our golden worlds of poetry, are all
but &s;o many &s;hadowy images, and airy pro&s;|pects,
which ari&s;e to us but &s;o much the
livelier and more frequent, as we are more
o'erca&s;t with the darkne&s;s, and di&s;turb'd
with the fumes of human vanity.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thing that makes old men wil|ling
to leave this world, makes me willing
to leave poetry, long-habit, and wearine&s;s
of the &s;ame track. <HI>Homer</HI> will work a
cure upon me; fifteen thou&s;and ver&s;es are
equivalent to four&s;core years, to make one
old in Rhime: And I &s;hou'd be &s;orry and

like a waggoner's hor&s;e, in the &s;ame road,
and &s;o leave my <HI>Bells</HI> to the next &s;illy ani|mal

makes a mean figure in the eyes of rea&s;on,
who is mea&s;uring &s;yllables and coupling
rhimes, when he &s;hou'd be mending his own
Soul, and &s;ecuring his own immortality. If

<P>I Have no better excu&s;e to offer you, that

<P>I find by dear experience, we live in an

in the right &s;o very violently, may be of
wor&s;e con&s;equence than to be ea&s;ily and qui|etly

well, that I am &s;atisfied but few can wi&s;h
me &s;o; but if tho&s;e few are &s;uch as tell me
they do, I am content, for they are the be&s;t
people I know: While you believe me what
I profe&s;s as to Religion, I can bear any thing
the bigotted may &s;ay; while Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI>

hone&s;t and moral of each party think me no
ill man, I can ea&s;ily &s;upport it, tho' the mo&s;t
violent and mad of all parties ro&s;e up to
throw dirt at me.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t expect an hundred attacks upon
the publication of my <HI>Homer.</HI> Whoever in
our times would be a profe&s;&s;or of learning
above his fellows, ought at the very fir&s;t to
enter the world with the con&s;tancy and re|&s;olution

It is certainly to be lamented, that
if any man does but endeavour to di&s;tingui&s;h

is immediately treated as a common enemy,
in&s;tead of being look'd upon as a common

no man ever ro&s;e to any degree of prefection
in writing, but through ob&s;tinacy and an in|veterate
re&s;olution again&s;t the &s;tream of man|kind:
So that if the world has receiv'd any
benefit from the labours of the Learned, it
was in its own de&s;pite. For when fir&s;t they
e&s;&s;ay their parts, all people in general are
prejudiced again&s;t new beginners; and when
they have got a little above contempt, then
&s;ome particular per&s;on who were before un|fortunate
in their own attempts, are &s;worn
foes to them only becau&s;e they &s;ucceed.&mdash;Upon the whole, one may &s;ay of the be&s;t
writers, that they pay a &s;evere fine for their
fame, which it is always in the power of the

I fancy no friend&s;hip is &s;o likely to prove
la&s;ting as ours, becau&s;e I am pretty &s;ure
there never was a friend&s;hip of &s;o ea&s;ie a
nature. We neither of us demand any
mighty things from each other; what Va|nity
we have expects its gratification from
other people. It is not I, that am to tell
you what an Arti&s;t you are, nor is it you
that are to tell me what a Poet I am;
but 'tis from the world abroad we hope,
(piou&s;ly hope) to hear the&s;e things. At
home we follow our bu&s;ine&s;s, when we
have any; and think and talk mo&s;t of each
other when we have none. 'Tis not unlike
the happy friend&s;hip of a &s;tay'd man and
his wife, who are &s;eldom &s;o fond as to hin|der
the bu&s;ine&s;s, of the hou&s;e from going
on all day, or &s;o indolent as not to find
con&s;olation in each other every evening.
Thus well-meaning couples hold in amity
to the la&s;t, by not expecting too much from
human nature; while romantick friend|&s;hips,
like violent loves, begin with di&s;|quiets,
proceed to jealou&s;ies, and conclude
in animo&s;ities. I have liv'd to &s;ee the fierce

<P>WHatever &s;tudies on the one hand, or

The Ta&s;k I undertook<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Tran&s;lation of <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Iliad.</HI></NOTE>, tho' of weight

<P>I find &s;till more rea&s;on to complain of

I have been forced to write to him
in &s;o high a &s;tyle, that were my epi&s;tle in|tercepted,
it would rai&s;e no &s;mall admira|tion

remove &s;uch and &s;uch mountains, alter the

in &s;ome fear of a country Ju&s;tice. To di&s;|arm
me indeed may be but prudential, con|&s;idering
what armies I have at pre&s;ent on

for all that I can tell, they may be as for|midable

&s;eem proper forces to &s;end again&s;t tho&s;e in

<P>I Have been acquainted by one of my
friends who omits no opportunities of
gratifying me, that you have lately been
pleas'd to &s;peak of me in a manner which
nothing but the real re&s;pect I have for
you can de&s;erve. May I hope that &s;ome
late malevolencies have lo&s;t their effect?
Indeed it is neither for me, nor my ene|mies,
to pretend to tell you whether I am
your friend or not; but it you would judge
by probabilities, I beg to know which of
your poetical acquaintance has &s;o little In|tere&s;t
in pretending to be &s;o? Methinks
no man &s;hould que&s;tion the real friend&s;hip
of one who de&s;ires no real &s;ervice: I am
only to get as much from the <HI>Whigs,</HI> as I
got by the <HI>Tories,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Civility;
being neither &s;o proud as to be in&s;en&s;ible
of any good office, nor &s;o humble, as not
<PB N="85" REF="85">
to dare heartily to de&s;pi&s;e any man who
does me an inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I will not value my &s;elf upon having
ever guarded all the degrees of re&s;pect for
you; for (to &s;ay the truth) all the world
&s;peaks well of you, and I &s;hould be under
a nece&s;&s;ity of doing the &s;ame, whether I
car'd for you or not.</P>
<P>As to what you have &s;aid of me, I &s;hall
never believe that the Author of <HI>Cato</HI> can
&s;peak one thing and think another. As a
proof that I account you &s;incere, I beg a
favour of you: It is, that you would look
over the two fir&s;t books of my tran&s;lation
of <HI>Homer,</HI> which are now in the hands of
my Lord <HI>Halifax.</HI> I am &s;en&s;ible how much
the reputation of any poetical work will
depend upon the character you give it:
'tis therefore &s;ome evidence of the tru&s;t I
repo&s;e in your good will, when I give you
this opportunity of &s;peaking ill of me with
ju&s;tice, and yet expect you will tell me your
true&s;t thoughts, at the &s;ame time that you
tell others your mo&s;t favourable ones.</P>
<P>I have a farther reque&s;t, which I mu&s;t
pre&s;s with earne&s;tne&s;s, My Book&s;eller is
reprinting the <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m,</HI> to which
you have done too much honour in your
<HI>Spectator</HI> of N^o 253. The period in that
paper, where you &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I have admitted
&s;ome &s;trokes of ill nature into that E&s;&s;ay,"</Q>
<PB N="86" REF="86">
is the only one I could wi&s;h omitted of all
you have written: but I wou'd not de&s;ire
it &s;hould be &s;o, unle&s;s I had the merit of
removing your objection: I beg you but to
point out tho&s;e &s;trokes to me, and you
may be a&s;&s;ured they &s;hall be treated with|out mercy.</P>
<P>Since we are upon proofs of &s;incerity
(which I am pretty confident will turn to
the advantage of us both in each others
opinion) give me leave to name another
pa&s;&s;age in the &s;ame <HI>Spectator,</HI> which I wi&s;h

<P>As to any anxiety I have concerning the

<P>THE Farce of the <HI>What-d'ye-call-it,</HI>
has occa&s;ioned many different &s;pecu|lations
in the town. Some look'd upon it as
meer je&s;t upon the tragic poets, others as a
&s;atire upon the late war. Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI>
hearing none of the words, and &s;eeing the
action to be tragical, was much a&s;toni&s;hed
to find the audience laugh; and &s;ays, the
Prince and Prince&s;s mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be un|der
no le&s;s amazement on the &s;ame account.
Several templers, and others of the more
<PB N="91" REF="91">
vociferous kind of criticks, went with a re|&s;olution
to hi&s;s, and confe&s;t they were forced
to laugh &s;o much, that they forgot the de|&s;ign
they came with. The Court in gene|ral
has in a very particular manner come
into the je&s;t, and the three fir&s;t Nights,
(notwith&s;tanding two of them were court-nights)
were di&s;tingui&s;h'd by very full audi|ences
of the fir&s;t quality. The common
people of the pit and gallery, receiv'd it
at fir&s;t with great gravity and &s;edatene&s;s,
&s;ome few with tears; but after the third
day they al&s;o took the hint, and have ever
&s;ince been very loud in their claps. There
are &s;till &s;ome &s;ober men who cannot be of
the general opinion, but the laughers are
&s;o much the majority, that one or two
criticks &s;eem determined to undeceive the
town at their proper co&s;t, by writing grave

<P>Ye&s;terday Mr. <HI>Steel</HI>'s affair was decided:
I am &s;orry I can be of no other opinion

writings of late. But certainly he has not

much even from his own party in the point

a&s;&s;ure you of the continuance of that e&s;teem

his Mutes too, a &s;ett of Nodders, Winkers,

The new Tran&s;lator of <HI>Homer</HI> is the hum|ble&s;t

<PB N="121" REF="121">
have the Advantage of Poets; you are
Ma&s;ter of an Art that mu&s;t pro&s;per and
grow rich, as long as people love, or are
proud of them&s;elves, or their own per&s;ons.
However, you have &s;tay'd long enough, me|thinks,
to have painted all the numberle&s;s

to be Hi&s;torical, I recommend to your

To the end you may be obliged (as Dr. P.

to come into <HI>England</HI> to copy the

<P>I long to &s;ee you a Hi&s;tory Painter. You

do &s;omething for the Publick; and be not
confined, like the re&s;t, to draw only &s;uch

as a piece of Gratitude from you, to make
them truly known to all nations, in the ac|count

I hope you think more warmly than

<P>As to your enquiry about your Hou&s;e,

<P>I Have long had it in my thoughts to
trouble you with a Letter, but was
di&s;couraged for want of &s;omething that I
could think worth &s;ending fifteen hundred
Miles. <HI>Italy</HI> is &s;uch an exhau&s;ted Subject,
that, I dare &s;ay, you'd ea&s;ily forgive my
&s;aying nothing of it; and the imagination
of a Poet, is a thing &s;o nice and delicate,
that it is no ea&s;y matter to find out Images
capable of giving Plea&s;ure to one of the
few, who (in any Age) have come up to
that Character. I am neverthele&s;s lately
return'd from an I&s;land, where I pa&s;&s;ed three
or four Months, which, were it &s;et out in
its true Colours, might methinks amu&s;e
you agreeably enough for a minute or two.
The I&s;land <HI>Inarime,</HI> is an Epitome of the
whole Earth, containing within the compa&s;s
of eighteen Miles, a wonderful variety of
Hills, Vales, ragged Rocks, fruitful Plains,
and barren Mountains, all thrown together
in a mo&s;t romantic Confu&s;ion. The Air is
<PB N="126" REF="126">
in the hotte&s;t Sea&s;on, con&s;tantly refre&s;hed
by cool breezes from the Sea. The Vales
produce excellent Wheat and <HI>Indian</HI> Corn,
but are mo&s;tly covered with Vineyards, in|termixt
with Fruit-trees. Be&s;ides the com|mon
kinds, as Cherries, Apricots, Pea|ches,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> they produce Oranges, Limes,
Almonds, Pomegranates, Figs, Water Me|lons,
and many other Fruits unknown to
our Climates, which lie every where open
to the Pa&s;&s;enger. The Hills are the greater
part covered to the top with Vines, &s;ome
with Che&s;nut Groves, and others with
thickets of Myrtle and Lenti&s;cus. The
Fields in the Northern &s;ide are divided by
hedge-rows of Myrtle. Several Fountains
and Rivulets add to the Beauty of this Land|&s;cape,
which is likewi&s;e &s;et off by the va|riety
of &s;ome barren Spots, and naked Rocks.
But that which crowns the Scene, is a large
Mountain, ri&s;ing out of the middle of the
I&s;land (once a terrible <HI>Volcano,</HI> by the An|cients
called <HI>Mons Epomeus</HI>) its lower parts
are adorned with Vines, and other Fruits,
the middle affords Pa&s;ture to flocks of Goats
and Sheep, and the top is a &s;andy pointed
Rock, from which you have the fine&s;t Pro|&s;pect
in the World, &s;urveying at one view,
be&s;ides &s;everal plea&s;ant I&s;lands lying at your
Feet, a tract of <HI>Italy</HI> about three hundred
Miles in length, from the Promontory of
<PB N="127" REF="127">
<HI>Antium,</HI> to the Cape of <HI>Palinurus.</HI> The
greater part of which, hath been &s;ung by
<HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> as making a con&s;iderable
part of the Travels and Adventures of their
two Heroes. The I&s;lands <HI>Caprea, Prochyta,</HI>
and <HI>Parthenope,</HI> together with <HI>Cajeta, Cumae,</HI>
<HI>Monte Mi&s;eno,</HI> the Habitations of <HI>Circe,</HI>
the <HI>Syrens,</HI> and the <HI>Le&s;trygones,</HI> the Bay
of <HI>Naples,</HI> the Promontory of <HI>Minerva,</HI> and
the whole <HI>Campagnia felice,</HI> make but a
part of this noble Land&s;cape; which would
demand an Imagination as warm, and num|bers
as flowing as your own, to de&s;cribe it.
The Inhabitants of this delicious I&s;le, as
they are without Riches and Honours, &s;o
are they without the Vices and Follies that
attend them; and were they but as much
&s;trangers to Revenge, as they are to Ava|rice
or Ambition, they might in fact an&s;wer
the poetical Notions of the Golden Age.
But they have got, as an alloy to their Hap|pine&s;s,
an ill habit of murdering one
another on &s;light Offences. We had an
In&s;tance of this the &s;econd Night after our
Arrival; a Youth of eighteen, being &s;hot
dead by our Door: And yet by the &s;ole &s;ecret
of minding our own Bu&s;ine&s;s, we found
a means of living &s;ecurely among the&s;e
dangerous People. Would you know how
we pa&s;s the time at <HI>Naples?</HI> Our chief En|tertainment
is the Devotion of our Neigh|bours.
<PB N="128" REF="128">
Be&s;ides the gayety of their Churches
(where Folks go to &s;ee what they call <HI>una
bella Devotione</HI> (i. e.) a &s;ort of Religious
Opera) they make Fireworks almo&s;t every
Week, out of Devotion; the Streets are
often hung with Arras, out of Devotion;
and (what is &s;till more &s;trange) the Ladies
invite Gentlemen to their Hou&s;es, and treat
them with Mu&s;ick and Sweetmeats, out of
Devotion; in a word, were it not for this
Devotion of its Inhabitants, <HI>Naples</HI> would
have little el&s;e to recommend it, be&s;ide the
Air and Situation. Learning is in no very
thriving &s;tate here, as indeed no where el&s;e
in <HI>Italy.</HI> However, among many pretenders,
&s;ome Men of ta&s;te are to be met with. A

that being to vi&s;it <HI>Salvini</HI> at <HI>Florence,</HI> he
found him reading your <HI>Homer.</HI> He liked
the Notes extreamly, and could find no

thought it approached too near a Paraphra&s;e;
which &s;hews him not to be &s;ufficiently ac|quainted

<P>The Hi&s;tory of my Tran&s;plantation

Po&s;terity (which no doubt will be made

<P>I Had pleas'd my&s;elf &s;ooner in writing
to you, but that I have been your Suc|ce&s;&s;or
in a Fit of Sickne&s;s, and am not yet
&s;o much recovered, but that I have thoughts
of u&s;ing your <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;es.</NOTE> Phy&s;icians. They are as
grave Per&s;ons as any of the Faculty, and
(like the Antients) carry their own Medi|caments
about with them. But indeed the
Moderns are &s;uch lovers of Raillery, that
nothing is grave enough to e&s;cape them.
Let 'em laugh, but People will &s;ill have
their Opinions: As they think our Doctors
A&s;&s;es to them, we'll think them A&s;&s;es to
our Doctors.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="135">
I am glad you are &s;o much in a better
&s;tate of Health, as to allow me to je&s;t
about it. My concern, when I heard of
your Danger, was &s;o very &s;erious, that I
almo&s;t take it ill Dr. <HI>Evans</HI> &s;hould tell you
of it, or you mention it. I tell you fairly,
if you and a few more &s;uch people were to
leave the World, I would not give &s;ix-pence
to &s;tay in it.</P>
<P>I am not &s;o much concern'd as to the
point, whether you are to live fat or lean:
Mo&s;t Men of Wit or Hone&s;ty are u&s;ually
decreed to live very lean; &s;o I am inclined
to the opinion that 'tis decreed you &s;hall:
However be comforted, and reflect that
you'll make the better Bu&s;to for it.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;omething particular in you, not to
be &s;atisfied with &s;ending me your own
Books, but to make your Acquaintance
continue the frolick. Mr. <HI>Wharton</HI> forc'd
me to take <HI>Gorboduc,</HI> which has &s;ince done
me great credit with &s;everal people, as it
has done <HI>Dryden</HI> and <HI>Oldham</HI> &s;ome di&s;|kindne&s;s,
in &s;hewing there is as much diffe|rence
between their <HI>Gorbuduc,</HI> and this,
as between Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> and King <HI>George.</HI>
It is truly a <HI>&s;candal,</HI> that Men &s;hould
write with contempt of a Piece which
they never once &s;aw, as tho&s;e two Poets
did, who were ignorant even of the Sex,

<P>TO convince you how little pain I
give my&s;elf, in corre&s;ponding with
Men of good Nature, and good Under&s;tand|ing,
you &s;ee I omit to an&s;wer your Letters

<PB N="138" REF="137">
therefore you are ever moved on my ac|count
by that Spirit; which I take to be
as &s;amiliar to you as a Quotidian Ague,
I mean the Spirit of Goodne&s;s, pray never
&s;tint it, in any fear of obliging me to a Ci|vility
beyond my natural Inclination: I dare
tru&s;t you, Sir, not only with my Folly
when I write, but with my Negligence
when I do not; and expect equally your
pardon for either.</P>
<P>If I knew how to entertain you thro' the
re&s;t of this Paper, it &s;hould be &s;potted and
diver&s;ified with Conceits all over; you
&s;hould be put out of breath with Laughter
at each Sentence, and pau&s;e at each Period,
to look back over how much Wit you had
pa&s;s'd. But I have found by experience,
that people now a-days regard Writing as
little as they do Preaching: The mo&s;t we
can hope is to be heard, ju&s;t with Decency
and Patience, once a week, by Folks in the
Country: Here in Town we hum over a
piece of fine Writing, and we whi&s;tle at a
Sermon. The Stage is the only place we
&s;eem alive at; there indeed we &s;tare, and
roar, and clap hands for K. <HI>George</HI> and the
Government. As for all other Virtues but
this Loyalty, they are an ob&s;olete Train,
&s;o ill-dre&s;s'd, that Men, Women, and Chil|dren
hi&s;s 'em out of all good Company.
Humility knocks &s;o &s;neakingly at the door,
<PB N="139" REF="138">
that every Footman out-raps it, and makes
it give way to the free Entrance of Pride,
Prodigality, and Vain-glory.</P>
<P>My Lady <HI>Scudamore,</HI> from having ru&s;ti|cated
in your Company too long, really
behaves her&s;elf &s;candalou&s;ly among&s;t us: She
pretends to open her eyes for the &s;ake of
&s;eeing the Sun, and to &s;leep becau&s;e it is
Night; drinks Tea at nine in the Morn|ing,
and is thought to have &s;aid her Prayers
before; talks without any manner of &s;hame
of good Books, and has not &s;een <HI>Cibber</HI>'s
Play of the <HI>Non-juror.</HI> I rejoyced the other
day to &s;ee a Libel on her Toilette, which
gives me &s;ome hope that you have at lea&s;t
a Ta&s;te of Scandal left you, in defect of all
other Vices.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, I heartily wi&s;h
you well; but as I cannot entirely de&s;ire
the ruin of all the Joys of this City, &s;o all
that remains is to wi&s;h you wou'd keep

<P>YOU'LL think me very full of my &s;elf,
when after a long Silence (which
<PB N="140" REF="139">
however to &s;ay truth has rather been em|ploy'd
to contemplate of you, than to for|get
you) I begin to talk of my own Works.
I find it is in the Fini&s;hing a Book, as in
concluding a Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, one al|was
thinks it will be very &s;oon, and finds
it very late. There are many unlook'd-for
Incidents to retard the Clearing <HI>any publick
Account,</HI> and &s;o I &s;ee it is in mine. I have
plagued my &s;elf, like great Mini&s;ters, with
undertaking too much for one Man, and
with a De&s;ire of doing more than was expect|ed
from me, have done le&s;s than I ought.</P>
<P>For having de&s;ign'd Four very laborious
and uncommon &s;orts of Indexes to <HI>Homer,</HI>
I'm forced, for want of time, to publi&s;h
two only; the de&s;ign of which you will own
to be pretty, tho' far from being fully exe|cuted.
I've al&s;o been oblig'd to leave un|fini&s;h'd
in my de&s;k the Heads of two E&s;&s;ays,
one on the <HI>Theology</HI> and <HI>Morality</HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI>
and another on the <HI>Oratory</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI> and
<HI>Virgil.</HI> So they mu&s;t wait for future Edi|tions,
or peri&s;h; and (one way or other, no
great matter which) <HI>dabit Deus his quoque
finem.</HI></P>
<P>I think of you every day, I a&s;&s;ire you,
even without &s;uch good Memorials of you
as your Si&s;ters, with whom I &s;ometimes talk
of you, and find it one of the mo&s;t agree|able
of all Subjects to them. My Lord
<PB N="141" REF="140">
<HI>Digby</HI> mu&s;t be perpetually remember'd by
all who ever knew him, or knew his Chil|dren.
There needs no more than an ac|quaintance
with your Family, to make all
Elder Sons wi&s;h they had Fathers to their
lives end.</P>
<P>I can't touch upon the &s;ubject of filial
Love, without putting you in mind of an
old Woman, who has a &s;incere, hearty, old|fa&s;hion'd
re&s;pect for you, and con&s;tantly
blames her Son for not having writ to you
oftner, to tell you &s;o.</P>
<P>I very much wi&s;h (but what &s;ignifies my
wi&s;hing? my Lady <HI>Scudamore wi&s;hes,</HI> your
Si&s;ters wi&s;h) that you were with us, to com|pare
the beautiful Contra&s;te this Sea&s;on affords
us, of the Town and the Country. No Ideas
you could form in the Winter can make you
imagine what <HI>Twickenham</HI> is (and what
your Friend Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> of <HI>Twickenham</HI> is)
in this warmer Sea&s;on. Our River glitters
beneath an unclouded Sun, at the &s;ame time
that its Banks retain the Verdure of Showers:
Our Gardens are offering their fir&s;t No&s;egays;
our Trees, like new Acquaintance brought
happily together, are &s;tretching their Arms
to meet each other, and growing nearer and
nearer every hour: The Birds are paying
their thank&s;giving Songs for the new Ha|bitations
I have made 'em: My Building
ri&s;es high enough to attract the eye and
<PB N="142" REF="141">
curio&s;ity of the Pa&s;&s;enger from the River,
where, upon beholding a mixture of Beauty
and Ruin, he enquires what hou&s;e is falling,
or what Church is ri&s;ing? So little ta&s;te
have our common Tritons of <HI>Vitruvius</HI>;
whatever delight the true, un&s;een, poetical
Gods of the River may take, in reflecting on
their Streams my <HI>Tu&s;can</HI> Porticos, or <HI>Ionic</HI>
Pila&s;ters.</P>
<P><HI>But</HI> (to de&s;cend from all this Pomp of
Style) the be&s;t account I can give of what
I am building, is, that it will afford me a
few plea&s;ant Rooms for &s;uch a Friend as
your&s;elf, or a cool &s;ituation for an hour or
two for Lady <HI>Scudamore,</HI> when &s;he will do
me the honour (at this Publick Hou&s;e on
the Road) to drink her own Cyder.</P>
<P>The moment I am writing this, I am
&s;urprized with the account of the Death of
a Friend of mine; which makes all I have
here been talking of a meer Je&s;t! Build|ings,
Gardens, Writings, Plea&s;ures, Works,
of whatever &s;tuff Man can rai&s;e! none of

<P>YOUR Doctor is going to the <HI>Bath,</HI>
and &s;tays a Fortnight or more: Per|haps
you would be comforted to have a
Sight of him, whether you need him or
not. I think him as good a Doctor as any
for one that is ill, and a better Doctor than
any one for one that is well. He would
do admirably for Mrs. <HI>Mary Digby:</HI> She
needed only to follow his Hints, to be in
eternal bu&s;ine&s;s and amu&s;ement of mind,
and even as active as &s;he could de&s;ire. But
indeed I fear &s;he would out-walk him: For
(as Dean <HI>Swift</HI> ob&s;erv'd to me the very fir&s;t
time I &s;aw the Doctor) <HI>He is a Man that can
do every thing, but walk.</HI> His Brother, who
is lately come into <HI>England,</HI> goes al&s;o to the
<HI>Bath</HI>; and is a more extraordinary Man than
he, worth your going thither on purpo&s;e to
know him. The Spirit of <HI>Philanthropy,</HI> &s;o
long dead to our World, is reviv'd in him:
He is a Philo&s;opher all of fire; &s;o warmly,
nay &s;o wildly in the right, that he forces all
others about him to be &s;o too, and draws
them into his own <HI>Vortex.</HI> He is a Star that
<PB N="146" REF="145">
looks as if it were all Fire, but is all Benig|nity,
all gentle and beneficial Influence.
If there be other men in the world that
would &s;erve a Friend, yet He is the only one
I believe that could make even an Enemy
&s;erve a Friend.</P>
<P>As all human Life is chequer'd and mixed
with Acqui&s;itions and Lo&s;&s;es (tho' the latter
are more certain and irremediable, than the
former la&s;ting or &s;atisfactory) &s;o at the time
I have gain'd the acquaintance of one wor|thy
Man I have lo&s;t another, a very ea&s;y,
humane, and gentlemanly Neighbour, Mr.
<HI>Stonor.</HI> It's certain the Lo&s;s of one of this
Character puts us naturally upon &s;etting a
greater Value on the few that are left, tho'
the degree of our E&s;teem may be different.
Nothing, &s;ays <HI>Seneca,</HI> is &s;o melancholy a

us to the thought of our own death,
as the reflection and pro&s;pect of one Friend

<P>YOUR making a &s;ort of Apology for
your not writing, is a very genteel
reproof to me. I know I was to blame,
but I know I did not intend to be &s;o, and
(what is the happie&s;t Knowledge in the
World) I know you will forgive me: For
&s;ure nothing is more &s;atisfactory than to
be certain of &s;uch a Friend as will overlook
one's failings, &s;ince every &s;uch in&s;tance is
a Conviction of his Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>If I am all my life to dwell in In|tentions,
and never ri&s;e to Actions, I have
but too much need of that gentle di&s;po&s;i|tion
which I experience in you. But I hope
better things of my&s;elf, and fully purpo&s;e
to make you a vi&s;it this Summer at <HI>Sher|bourn.</HI>
I'm told you are all upon removal
very &s;peedily, and that Mrs. <HI>Mary Digby</HI>
talks in a Letter to Lady <HI>Scudamore,</HI> of
&s;eeing my Lord <HI>Bathur&s;t</HI>'s Wood in her
way. How much I wi&s;h to be her Guide
thro' that enchanted Fore&s;t, is not to be
expre&s;t: I look upon my&s;elf as the Magi|cian
appropriated to the place, without
whom no mortal can penetrate into the
Rece&s;&s;es of tho&s;e &s;acred Shades. I could
pa&s;s whole Days, in only de&s;cribing to
<PB N="150" REF="149">
her the future, and as yet vi&s;ionary Beau|ties,
that are to ri&s;e in tho&s;e Scenes:
The Palace that is to be built, the Pa|villions
that are to glitter, the Colonnades
that are to adorn them: Nay more, the
meeting of the <HI>Thames</HI> and the <HI>Severn,</HI>
which (when the noble Owner has finer
Dreams than ordinary) are to be led into
each others Embraces thro' &s;ecret Caverns
of not above twelve or fifteen Miles, till
they ri&s;e and openly celebrate their Mar|riage
in the mid&s;t of an immen&s;e Amphi|theatre,
which is to be the Admiration of
Po&s;terity a hundred Years hence. But till
the de&s;tin'd time &s;hall arrive that is to
manife&s;t the&s;e Wonders, Mrs. <HI>Digby</HI> mu&s;t
content her&s;elf with &s;eeing what is at

in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Objects that attract this part of

Women of Quality are all turn'd
Followers of the <HI>Camp</HI> in <HI>Hyde-Park</HI>
this Year, whither all the Town re&s;ort to
magnificent Entertainments given by the
Officers, &amp;c. The <HI>Scythian</HI> Ladies that
dwelt in the Waggons of War, were not
more clo&s;ely attached to the Luggage.
The Matrons, like tho&s;e of <HI>Sparta,</HI> attend
their Sons to the Field, to be the Witne&s;&s;es

with all their Charms di&s;play'd, provoke the

to all my Contemporaries, and won't &s;o

<P>THE &s;ame rea&s;on that hinder'd your

&s;ince the willing Confinement I have lain
under here with my Mother, (whom it is
natural and rea&s;onable I &s;hould rejoice with

your Ab&s;ence from <HI>London,</HI> for I could

you to a &s;ick Room hither from the fir&s;t

I know your love of Ea&s;e &s;o well, that you
might be in danger of being too Quiet to
enjoy Quiet, and too Philo&s;ophical to be a
Philo&s;opher; were it not for the Ferment
Lord <HI>B.</HI> will put you into. One of his Lord|&s;hip's
Maxims is, that a total Ab&s;tinence
from Intemperance or Bu&s;ine&s;s, is no more
<HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> than a total Con&s;opition of the
Sen&s;es is <HI>Repo&s;e</HI>; one mu&s;t <HI>Feel</HI> enough of

I'll engage you &s;hall be fit for his Lord&s;hip

Folly will laugh you into all the Cu&s;toms

which I hope will be far from
you. I am telling the wor&s;t that can come

Folly is many an hone&s;t Man's, nay every

is &s;omething better, though at her advanc'd
Age every Day is a Climacterick. There
was join'd to this an Indi&s;po&s;ition of my own,
which I ought to look upon as a &s;light one,
compar'd with my Mother's, (becau&s;e my

<P>The Article you enquire of, is of as little

namely the Railing Papers about the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI>
If the Book has Merit, (and &s;ince you like it,

<P>I wi&s;h I had nothing to trouble me more;
an hone&s;t Mind is not in the power of any

be &s;ome Guilt or Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, which is
incon&s;i&s;tent with its own Principles. Not

<P>I've had an Occa&s;ion to make the&s;e Re|flections

one that concerns my Morals, and (which I

a Life as you have been long accu&s;tomed to

Pyes and Plum-broth) whereof frequent

That feeding the Hungry, and giving Alms
to the Poor, do yet make a Part of good
Hou&s;e-keeping, in a Latitude not more re|mote

And la&s;tly, that Prayers and Roa&s;t-beef
actually make &s;ome People as happy, as a

I a&s;&s;ure you, Men, Women, and Children

Rapine for Ju&s;tice, Time-&s;erving for
Fortitude, and Luxury for Temperance.
Whatever you may fancy where you live

Comick Poet, and our Friend, <HI>Wycherly.</HI>
He had often told me, as I doubt not he did
all his Acquaintance, that he would Marry
as &s;oon as his life was de&s;pair'd of. Accord|ingly
a few days before his Death he un|derwent
the Ceremony; and join'd together
tho&s;e two Sacraments which wi&s;e Men &s;ay
&s;hould be the la&s;t we receive; For if you ob|&s;erve,
Matrimony is plac'd after Extreme
<PB N="168" REF="165">
Unction in our Catechi&s;m, as a kind of Hint
of the Order of Time in which they are to
be taken. The old Man then lay down,
&s;atisfy'd in the Con&s;cience of having,
by this one Act paid his ju&s;t Debts, obliged
a Woman who (he was told) had Merit, and
&s;hewn an heroick re&s;entment of the ill u&s;age
of his next Heir. Some hundred pounds
which he had with the Lady, di&s;charg|ed
tho&s;e Debts; a Jointure of four hundred
a year made her a Recompen&s;e; and the
Nephew he left to comfort him&s;elf as well
as he could, with the mi&s;erable Remains of
a mortgaged E&s;tate. I &s;aw our Friend
twice after this was done, le&s;s peevi&s;h in
his Sickne&s;s than he u&s;ed to be in his Health;
neither much afraid of Dying, nor (which in

<P>I Am ju&s;t return'd from the Country'
whither Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI> accompanied me, and
pa&s;s'd a Week in the Fore&s;t. I need not tell
you how much a Man of his Turn entertain'd
me; but I mu&s;t acquaint you there is a Vi|vacity
and Gaiety of Di&s;po&s;ition almo&s;t pe|culiar
to him, which make it impo&s;&s;ible to
part from him without that unea&s;ine&s;s which
<PB N="170" REF="167">
generally &s;ucceeds all our plea&s;ures. I have
been ju&s;t taking a &s;olitary walk by Moon|&s;hine,
full of reflections on the tran&s;itory na|ture
of all human delights; and giving my
Thoughts a loo&s;e in the contemplation of
tho&s;e Satisfactions which probably we may
hereafter ta&s;te in the Company of &s;eparate
Spirits, when we &s;hall range the Walks a|bove,
and perhaps gaze on this World at as
va&s;t a di&s;tance as we now do on tho&s;e
Worlds. The plea&s;ures we are to enjoy in
that Conver&s;ation mu&s;t undoubtedly be of
a nobler kind, and (not unlikely) may pro|ceed
from the Di&s;coveries each &s;hall commu|nicate
to another, of God and of Nature;
for the Happine&s;s of Minds can &s;urely be
nothing but Knowledge.</P>
<P>The highe&s;t Gratification we receive here
from Company is <HI>Mirth,</HI> which at the be&s;t
is but a fluttering unquiet Motion, that
beats about the brea&s;t for a few Moments,
and after leaves it void and empty.</P>
<P>Keeping good Company, even the be&s;t,
is but a le&s;s &s;hameful Art of lo&s;ing Time.</P>
<P>What we here call <HI>Science</HI> and <HI>Study,</HI> are
little better: The greater number of Arts
to which we apply our&s;elves are mere Grop|ing
in the Dark; and even the &s;earch of our
mo&s;t important Concerns in a future being,
is but a needle&s;s, anxious, and uncertain
ha&s;te to be knowing, &s;ooner than we can,
<PB N="171" REF="168">
what without all this &s;ollicitude we &s;hall
know a little later. We are but <HI>Curious
Impertinents</HI> in the ca&s;e of Futurity. 'Tis
not our bu&s;ine&s;s to be gue&s;&s;ing what the State
of Souls &s;hall be, but to be doing what may
make our own State happy; We cannot be
Knowing, but we can be Virtuous.</P>
<P>If this be my Notion of a great part of
that high Science, Divinity; you will be &s;o
civil as to imagine I lay no mighty Stre&s;s up|on
the re&s;t. Even of my darling Poetry I
really make no other u&s;e, than Hor&s;es of the
Bells that gingle about their Ears (tho' now
and then they to&s;s their Heads as if they
were proud of 'em) only to Jogg on a little
more merrily.</P>
<P>Your Ob&s;ervations on the narrow concep|tions
of Mankind in the point of Friend|&s;hip,
confirm me in what I was &s;o fortu|nate
as at my fir&s;t knowledge of you to
hope, and &s;ince &s;o amply to experience. Let
me take &s;o much decent Pride and Dignity
upon me, as to tell you, that but for Opini|ons
like the&s;e, which I di&s;cover'd in your
Mind, I had never made the Trial I have
done; which has &s;ucceeded &s;o much to mine,
and I believe not le&s;s to your Satisfaction:
For if I know you right, your Plea&s;ure is
greater in obliging me, than I can feel on my
part, till it falls in my power to oblige you.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="169">
Your Remark, that the Variety of opini|on
in Politicks or Religion is often rather
a Gratification, than Objection, to people
who have Sen&s;e enough to con&s;ider the beau|tiful
order of Nature in her Variations;
makes me think you have not con&s;trued
<HI>Joannes Secundus</HI> wrong, in the Ver&s;e which
precedes that which you quote: <HI>Bene nota
Fides,</HI> as I take it, does no way &s;ignify the
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholic Religion, tho' <HI>Secundus</HI>
was of it. I think it was a generous thought,
and one that flow'd from an exalted mind,
that it was not improbable but God might
be delighted with the various methods of
wor&s;hipping him, which divided the whole
World. I am pretty &s;ure You and I &s;hould
no more make good <HI>Inqui&s;itors</HI> to the mo|dern
Tyrants in Faith, than we could have
been qualify'd for <HI>Lictors</HI> to <HI>Procru&s;tes,</HI> when
he converted refractory Members with the
Rack. In a word, I can only repeat to you
what I think I have formerly &s;aid; that I as
little fear God will damn a Man who has
Charity, as I hope that any Prie&s;t cans &s;ave
him without it.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>March 20, 1715-16.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Find that a real concern is not only a
Hindrance to Speaking, but to Writing
too: The more time we give our &s;elves to
think over one's own, or a Friends unhappi|ne&s;s,
the more unable we grow to expre&s;s the
grief that proceeds from it. It is as natural
to delay a Letter, at &s;uch a Sea&s;on as this,
as to retard a melancholy Vi&s;it to a Per&s;on
one cannot relieve. One is a&s;hamed in
that Circum&s;tance, to pretend to entertain
people with trifling, in&s;ignificant affectations
of Sorrow on the one hand, or un&s;ea&s;onable
and forced Gayeties on the other. 'Tis a
kind of profanation of things &s;acred; to
treat &s;o &s;olemn a matter as a generous vo|luntary
Suffering, with Compliments or
Heroic Gallantries. Such a Mind as
your's has no need of being Spirited up in|to
Honour, or like a weak Woman, Prai&s;ed
into an opinion of its own Virtue. 'Tis
enough to do and &s;uffer what we ought;
and Men &s;hould know, that the noble pow|er
of Suffering bravely is as far above that
of Enterprizing greatly, as an unblemi&s;h'd
Con&s;cience and inflexible Re&s;olution are a|bove
<PB N="174" REF="171">
an accidential Flow of Spirits, or a &s;ud|den
Tide of Blood. If the whole Religious
Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mankind be included in Re&s;igna|tion
to our Maker, and Charity to our Fel|low
Creatures; there are now &s;ome People
who give us the Opportunity of affording as
bright an Example in practi&s;ing the one, as
them&s;elves have given an infamous In&s;tance
of the Violation of the other. Whoever is
really brave, has always this Comfort when
he is oppre&s;t, that he knows him&s;elf to be
&s;uperior to tho&s;e who injure him: For the
greate&s;t Power on Earth can no &s;ooner do
him that Injury, but the brave Man can
make him&s;elf greater by forgiving it.</P>
<P>If it were generous to &s;eek for allevia|ting
Con&s;olations in a Calamity of &s;o much
Glory, one might &s;ay that to be ruin'd thus
in the Gro&s;s, with a whole People, is but
like peri&s;hing in the General Conflagra|tion,
where nothing we can value is left
behind us.</P>
<P>Methinks in our pre&s;ent Condition, the
mo&s;t heroic thing we are left capable of
doing, is to endeavour to lighten each other's
Load, and (oppre&s;t as we are) to &s;uccour
&s;uch as are yet more oppre&s;t. If there are
too many who cannot be a&s;&s;i&s;ted but by
what we cannot give, our Money, there are
yet others who may be relieved by our Coun|&s;el,
by our Countenance, and even by our
<PB N="175" REF="172">
Chearfulne&s;s. The Misfortunes of private
Families, the Mi&s;under&s;tandings of People
whom Di&s;tre&s;&s;es make &s;u&s;picious, the Cold|ne&s;&s;es
of Relations whom Change of Religi|on
may di&s;-unite, or the Nece&s;&s;ities of half|ruin'd
E&s;tates render unkind to each other;
the&s;e at lea&s;t may be &s;often'd in &s;ome de|grees,
by a general well-manag'd Humanity
among our&s;elves, if all tho&s;e who have your
Principles of Belief, had al&s;o your Sen&s;e and
Conduct. But indeed mo&s;t of 'em have
given lamentable <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This was written in the Year of the Affair of <HI>Pre&s;ton.</HI></NOTE> proofs of the contrary;
and 'tis to be apprehended that they who
want Sen&s;e, are only religious thro' weakne&s;s,
and good-natur'd thro' Shame: The&s;e are
narrow-minded Creatures that never deal
in E&s;&s;entials; their Faith never looks be|yond
Ceremonials, nor their Charity be|yond
Relations. As poor as I am, I would
gladly relieve any di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, con&s;cientious
<HI>French</HI> Refugee at this in&s;tant: What mu&s;t
my Concern then be, when I perceive
&s;o many Anxieties now tearing tho&s;e Hearts
which I have de&s;ired a place in, and Clouds
of Melancholy ri&s;ing on tho&s;e Faces which
I have long look'd upon with Affection? I
begin already to feel both what &s;ome ap|prehend,
and what others are yet too &s;tu|pid
<PB N="176" REF="173">
to apprehend. I grieve with the Old,
for &s;o many additional Incoveniencies, and
Chagrins, more than their &s;mall Remain of
Life &s;eem'd de&s;tin'd to undergo; and with the
Young, for &s;o many of tho&s;e Gayeties and
Plea&s;ures (the Portion of Youth) which they
will by this means be depriv'd of. This
brings into my mind one or other of tho&s;e
I love be&s;t, and among them the Widow and
Fatherle&s;s, late of&mdash;As I am certain
no People living had an earlier and truer
Sen&s;e of others Misfortunes, or a more gene|rous

own; &s;o I earne&s;tly wi&s;h, that whatever
part they mu&s;t bear may be render'd as &s;up|portable
to them as it is in the power of
any Friend to make it.</P>
<P>But I know you have prevented me in
this Thought, as you always will any
thing that's good, or generous: I find by a
Letter of your Lady's (which I have &s;een)
that their Ea&s;e and Tranquility is part
of your Care. I believe there's &s;ome Fata|lity
in it, that you &s;hould always, from time
to time, be doing tho&s;e particular things that
make me enamour'd of you,</P>
<P>I write this from <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Fore&s;t, of which
I am come to take my la&s;t look. We here
bid our Neighbours adieu, much as tho&s;e
who go to be hang'd do their Fellow-Pri&s;oners,
who are condemn'd to follow

them a few weeks after. I parted from
hone&s;t Mr. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> with tenderne&s;s; and
from old Sir <HI>William Trumball</HI> as from a
venerable Prophet, foretelling with lifted
hands the Mi&s;eries to come, from which he
is ju&s;t going to be remov'd him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Perhaps, now I have learnt &s;o far as
<Q>&mdash;Nos dulcia linquimus arva,</Q></P>
<P>My next Le&s;&s;on may be
<Q>Nos Patriam fugimus&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Let that, and all el&s;e be as Heaven plea&s;es!
I have provided ju&s;t enough to keep me a
Man of Honour. I believe you and I &s;hall
never be a&s;ham'd of each other. I know
I wi&s;h my Country well, and if it undoes

<P>IF a Regard both to Publick and Private
Affairs may plead a lawful Excu&s;e in
behalf of a negligent Corre&s;pondent, I have
really a very good Title to it: I cannot &s;ay
<PB N="178" REF="175">
whether 'tis a Felicity or Unhappine&s;s, that
I am obliged at this time to give up my
whole Application to <HI>Homer</HI>; when without
that Employment, my Thoughts mu&s;t turn
upon what is le&s;s agreeable, the Violence, Mad|ne&s;s
and Re&s;entment of modern War-makers,
which are likely to prove (to &s;ome People at
lea&s;t) more fatal, than the &s;ame Qualities in
<HI>Achilles</HI> did to his unfortunate Country|men.</P>
<P>Tho' the change of my Scene of Life,
from <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Fore&s;t to the Side of the
<HI>Thames,</HI> be one of the grand <HI>Aera's</HI> of my
days, and may be called a notable Period
in &s;o incon&s;iderable a Hi&s;tory? yet you can
&s;carce imagine any Hero pa&s;&s;ing from one
Stage of Life to another, with &s;o much
Tranquility, &s;o ea&s;y a Tran&s;ition, and &s;o
laudable a Behaviour. I am become &s;o truly
a Citizen of the World (according to <HI>Pla|to</HI>'s
Expre&s;&s;ion) that I look with equal In|difference
on what I have lo&s;t, and on what
I have gained. The Times and Amu&s;ements
pa&s;t are not more like a Dream to me, than
tho&s;e which are pre&s;ent: I lie in a refre&s;h|ing
kind of Inaction, and have one Comfort
at lea&s;t from Ob&s;curity, that the <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI>
helps me to <HI>&s;leep</HI> the better. I now and
then reflect upon the Enjoyment of my
Friends, whom I fancy I remember much
as &s;eparate Spirits do us, at tender Intervals,
<PB N="179" REF="176">
neither interrupting their own Employ|ments
nor altogether carele&s;s of ours, but
in general con&s;tantly wi&s;hing us well, and
hoping to have us one day in their Com|pany.</P>
<P>To grow indifferent to the World is to
grow Philo&s;ophical, or Religious; (which|&s;oever
of tho&s;e Turns we chance to take)
and indeed the World is &s;uch a thing as
one that thinks pretty much, mu&s;t either
laugh at, or be angry with: but if we
laugh at it, they &s;ay we are proud; and if
we are angry with it, they &s;ay we are ill|natur'd.
So the mo&s;t politic Way is to &s;eem
always better pleas'd than one can be,
greater Admirers, greater Lovers, and in
&s;hort greater Fools, than we really are:
So &s;hall we live comfortably with our Fami|lies,
quietly with our Neighbours, favour'd
by our Ma&s;ters, and happy with our Mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es.
I have filled my Paper, and &s;o adieu.</P>

I am forced to make a fair Compo&s;ition with

<P>YOUR kind Letter has overtaken me

am pleas'd to date this from a place &s;o
well known to Mrs. <HI>Blount,</HI> where I write
as if I were dictated by her Ance&s;tors,
who&s;e faces are all upon me. I fear none
&s;o much as Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Gui&s;e,</HI> who be|ing

me, as her own Sir <HI>John</HI> was to demoli&s;h
Duke <HI>Lanca&s;tere.</HI> I date &s;ay your Lady
will recollect his Figure. I look'd upon
the Man&s;ion, Walls, and Terraces; the

made to command a variety of Vallies
and ri&s;ing Woods; with a Veneration mixt
with a Plea&s;ure, that repre&s;ented her to

Only I don't remember to have read, that
any of tho&s;e venerable and holy Per&s;ona|ges

Sons and Daughters. You mu&s;t mode&s;tly be

Piety be &s;o Romantick, I &s;hall turn Her|mit

<P>YOUR very kind and obliging man|ner
of enquiring after me, among the
fir&s;t concerns of Life, at your Re&s;u&s;citation,
&s;hould have been &s;ooner an&s;wer'd and ac|knowledg'd.
I &s;incerely rejoice at your re|covery
from an Illne&s;s which gave me le&s;s
pain than it did you, only from my Igno|rance
of it. I &s;hould have el&s;e been &s;eri|ou&s;ly
and deeply affected, in the thought of
your danger by a Fever. I think it a fine
and a natural thought, which I lately read
in a private Letter of <HI>Montaigne,</HI> giving an
account of the la&s;t Words of an intimate
Friend of his: <Q REND="inline">'Adieu my Friend! the pain
I feel will &s;oon be over, but I grieve for
<PB N="187" REF="184">
that you are to feel, which is to la&s;t you
for life.'</Q></P>
<P>I joyn with your Family in giving God
thanks for lending us a worthy Man &s;ome
what longer. The Comforts you receive
from their Attendance put me in mind of
what old <HI>Fletcher</HI> of <HI>Saltoune</HI> &s;aid one day
to me. <Q REND="inline">'Alas, I have nothing to do but to
dye; I am a poor Individual; no Crea|ture
to wi&s;h, or to fear, for my life or
death: 'Tis the only rea&s;on I have to re|pent
being a &s;ingle Man; now I grow old,
I am like a Tree without a Prop, and
without young Trees of my own &s;hedding,
to grow round me, for Company and De|fence.'</Q></P>
<P>I hope the Gout will &s;oon go after the
Fever, and all evil things remove far from
you. But pray tell me, when will you move
towards us? If you had an Interval to get
hither, I care not what fixes you afterwards,
except the Gout. Pray come, and never &s;tir
from us again. Do away your dirty Acres,
ca&s;t 'em to dirty People, &s;uch as in the
Scripture Phra&s;e <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s the Land.</HI> Shake off
your Earth like the noble Animal in <HI>Milton,</HI></P>
<Q><L>The tawny Lyon, pawing to get free</L>
<L>His hinder Parts, be &s;prings as broke from Bonds,</L>
<L>And rampant &s;hakes his brinded Main: the Ounce,</L>
<L>The Lizard and the Tiger, as the Mole</L>
<L>Ri&s;ing, the crumbled Earth above them threw</L><L>In Hillocks!</L></Q>
<P><PB N="188" REF="185">
But I believe <HI>Milton</HI> never thought, the&s;e
fine Ver&s;es of his &s;hould be apply'd to a
Man &s;elling a parcel of dirty acres; tho'
in the main I think it may have &s;ome re|&s;emblance;

<P>Believe, dear Sir, I truly love and value

<P>YOU may truly do me the Ju&s;tice to

with all which, I cannot deny but I have a
mixture of Envy to you all, for loving
one another &s;o well; and for enjoying the
&s;weets of that life, which can only be ta&s;ted
by people of good will.</P>
<Q><L>They from all Shades the Darkne&s;s can exclude,</L>
<L>And from a De&s;art bani&s;h Solitude.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Torbay</HI> is a Paradi&s;e, and a Storm is but
an amu&s;ement to &s;uch people. If you
drink Tea upon a Promontory that over|hangs
the Sea, it is preferable to an A&s;&s;em|bly;
and the whi&s;tling of the Wind better
Mu&s;ick to contented and loving Minds, than
the Opera to the Spleenful, Ambitious, Di&s;|eas'd,
Di&s;ta&s;ted, and Di&s;tracted Souls, which
this World affords; nay, this World affords

<P>I take that Period to be very Sublime, and to
include more than a hundred Sentences that
might be writ to expre&s;s Di&s;traction, Hurry,
Multiplication of Nothings, and all the fati|guing
perpetual Bu&s;ine&s;s of having no Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to

&s;eriou&s;ly (and of late I have met with &s;o many
Occa&s;ions of thinking &s;eriou&s;ly, that I begin
never to think otherwi&s;e) I cannot but think
the&s;e things very idle; as idle, as if a Bea&s;t
of Burden &s;hou'd go on jingling his Bells,
without bearing any thing valuable about
him, or ever &s;erving his Ma&s;ter.<Q><L>Life's vain Amu&s;ements, amid&s;t which we awell;</L>
<L>Not weigh'd, or under&s;tood by the grim God of Hell!</L></Q></P>
<P>Said a heathen Poet; as he is tran&s;lated
by a Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hop, who has, fir&s;t by
his Exhortations, and &s;ince by his Example,
taught me to <HI>think</HI> as becomes a Rea&s;onable
Creature.&mdash;But he is gone! He carry'd a|way
more Learning than is left in this Nation
behind him: but he left us more in the noble
Example of bearing Calamity well. 'Tis
true, we want Literature very much; but
pray God we don't want Patience more! if
the&s;e Precedents are to prevail.</P>
<P>I remember I promis'd to write to you,
as &s;oon as I &s;hould hear you were got home.
You mu&s;t look on this as the fir&s;t Day I've
been my&s;elf, and pa&s;s over the mad Interval
un-imputed to me. How punctual a Cor|re&s;pondent
I &s;hall hence-forward be able,

<P>YOU &s;hew your &s;elf a ju&s;t Man and a
Friend in tho&s;e Gue&s;&s;es and Suppo&s;i|tions
you make at the po&s;&s;ible rea&s;ons of my
Silence; every one of which is a true one.
As to forgetfulne&s;s of you or yours, I a&s;&s;ure
you, the promi&s;cuous Conver&s;ations of the
Town &s;erve only to put me in mind of bet|ter,
and more quiet, to be had in a Corner
of the World (undi&s;turb'd, innocent, &s;erene,
and &s;en&s;ible) with &s;uch as you. Let no Ac|ce&s;s
of any Di&s;tru&s;t make you think of me
differently in a cloudy day from what you
do in the mo&s;t &s;un-&s;hiny Weather. Let the
young Ladies be a&s;&s;ured I make nothing new
in my Gardens without wi&s;hing to &s;ee the
print of their Fairy Steps in every part of
'em. I have put the la&s;t Hand to my works
of this kind, in happily fini&s;hing the &s;ubter|raneous
Way and Grotto; I there found a
Spring of the cleare&s;t Water, which falls
in a perpetual Rill, that ecchoes thro' the
Cavern day and night. From the Ri|ver
<HI>Thames,</HI> you &s;ee thro' my Arch up a
Walk of the Wilderne&s;s to a kind of open
<PB N="192" REF="189">
Temple, wholly compos'd of Shells in the
Ru&s;tic Manner; and from that di&s;tance un|der
the Temple you look down thro' a &s;lop|ing
Arcade of Trees, and &s;ee the Sails on the
River pa&s;&s;ing &s;uddenly and vani&s;hing, as
thro' a Per&s;pective Gla&s;s. When you &s;hut
the Doors of this Grotto, it becomes on the
in&s;tant, from a luminous Room, a <HI>Camera
ob&s;cura</HI>; on the Walls of which all the Ob|jects
of the River, Hills, Woods, and Boats,
are forming a moving Picture in their vi&s;ible
Radiations: And when you have a mind to
light it up, it affords you a very different Scene:
It is fini&s;hed with &s;hells inter&s;per&s;ed with
Pieces of Looking-gla&s;s in angular forms;
and in the Cieling is a Star of the &s;ame Ma|terial,
at which when a Lamp (of an orbi|cular
Figure of thin Alaba&s;ter) is hung in the
Middle, a thou&s;and pointed Rays glitter and
are reflected over the Place. There are con|nected
to this Grotto by a narrower Pa&s;&s;age
two Porches, with Niches and Seats; one
toward the River, of &s;mooth Stones, full of
light and open; the other toward the Arch
of Trees, rough with Shells, Flints and Iron
Ore. The Bottom is paved with &s;imple
Pebble, as the adjoining Walk up the Wil|derne&s;s
to the Temple, is to be Cockle-&s;hells,
in the natural Ta&s;te, agreeing not ill with
the little dripping Murmur, and the Aquatic
Idea of the whole Place. It wants nothing
<PB N="193" REF="190">
to compleat it but a good Statue with an
In&s;cription, like that beautiful antique one
which you know I am &s;o fond of,<Q><L>Hujus Nympha loci, &s;acri cu&s;todia fontis</L>

<L>Ah bathe in Silence, or in &s;ilence lave.</L></Q></P>
<P>You'll think I have been very Poetical in
this De&s;cription, but it is pretty near the
Truth. I wi&s;h you were here to bear

has been in my Pocket in con&s;tant wearing,
till that, and the Pocket, and the Suit, are
worn out; by which means, I have read it
forty times, and I find by &s;o doing, that I
have not enough con&s;ider'd, and reflected
upon many others you have obliged me
with; for true Friend&s;hip, as they &s;ay of good

<P>I have had a Fever, a &s;hort one, but a
violent: I am now well. So it &s;hall take up
no more of this Paper.</P>
<P>I begin now to expect you in Town,
to make the Winter to come more tolera|ble

Heaven, when we wander in a Paradi&s;aical
Scene of Nature among Groves and Gardens:
but at this Sea&s;on, we are like our poor fir&s;t
Parents turn'd out of that agreeable tho' &s;oli|tary
life, and forc'd to look about for more
people to help to bear our labours, to get in|to
warmer Hou&s;es, and hive together in Ci|ties.</P>
<P>I hope you are long &s;ince perfectly re&s;tor'd,
and ri&s;en from your Gout, happy in the
delights of a contented Family, &s;miling at

Storms, laughing at Greatne&s;s, and merry
over a Chri&s;tmas-fire, exerci&s;ing all the
Functions of an old Patriarch in Charity and
Ho&s;pitality. I will not tell Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> what I
think &s;he is doing; for I conclude it is her
opinion, that he only ought to know it for
whom it is done: and &s;he will allow her&s;elf
to be far enough advanc'd above a fine Lady,
not to de&s;ire to &s;hine before Men.</P>
<P>Your Daughters perhaps may have &s;ome
other thoughts, which even their Mother
mu&s;t excu&s;e them for, becau&s;e &s;he is a Mo|ther.
I will not however &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e
thoughts get the better of their Devotions,
but rather excite 'em, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the warmth
of them; while their Prayer may be, that
they may rai&s;e up and breed as irreproach|able
a young Family as their Parents have
done. In a Word, I fancy you all well,
ea&s;y, and happy, ju&s;t as I wi&s;h you; and
next to that I wi&s;h you all with me.</P>
<P>Next to God, is a good Man: Next in
dignity, and next in value. <HI>Minui&s;ti eum
paullo minus ab Angelis.</HI> If therefore I wi&s;h
well to the good and the de&s;erving, and de|&s;ire
They only &s;hould be my companions

<HEAD>To J. GAY, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Dec. 16, 1731.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a&s;toni&s;hed at the Complaints occa|&s;ion'd
by a late <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> to the <HI>Earl</HI> of
<HI>Burlington</HI>; and I &s;hould be afflicted were
there the lea&s;t ju&s;t Ground for 'em. Had
the Writer attack'd <HI>Vice,</HI> at a Time when
it is not only tolerated but triumphant,
and &s;o far from being conceal'd as a <HI>De|fect,</HI>
that it is proclaimed with O&s;tenta|tion
as a <HI>Merit</HI>; I &s;hould have been ap|prehen&s;ive
of the Con&s;equence: Had he
&s;atirized Game&s;ters of a hundred thou|&s;and
pounds Fortune, acquired by &s;uch Me|thods
as are in daily practice, and almo&s;t
univer&s;ally encouraged: Had he overwarm|ly
defended the <HI>Religion of his Country,</HI> a|gain&s;t
&s;uch Books as come from every Pre&s;s,
are publickly vended in every Shop, and
greedily bought by almo&s;t every Rank of
Men; or had he called our excellent <HI>Weekly
Writings</HI> by the &s;ame Names which they
openly be&s;tow on the greate&s;t Men <HI>in</HI> the Mi|ni&s;try,
and <HI>out</HI> of the Mini&s;try, for which
they are all unpuni&s;hed, and mo&s;t rewarded:
<PB N="238" REF="234">
In any of the&s;e Ca&s;es, indeed, I might have
judged him too pre&s;umptious, and perhaps
have trembled for his Ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>I could not but hope better for this &s;mall
and mode&s;t Epi&s;tle, which attacks <HI>no one
Vice</HI> what&s;oever; which deals only in <HI>Folly</HI>
and not Folly in general, but a &s;ingle Spe|cies
of it; that only Branch, for the oppo|&s;ite
Excellency to which, the noble Lord to
whom it is written mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be cele|brated.
I fancied it might e&s;cape Cen&s;ure,
e&s;pecially &s;eeing how tenderly the&s;e Follies
are treated, and really le&s;s accu&s;ed, than
Apologized for.<Q><L>Yet hence the Poor are cloath'd, the Hungry fed,</L>
<L>Health to him&s;elf, and to his Infants Bread</L>
<L>The Lab'rer bears.</L></Q> Is this &s;uch a <HI>Crime,</HI> that to impute it to a
Man mu&s;t be a grievous Offence? 'Tis an
<HI>Innocent Folly,</HI> and much more <HI>Beneficent</HI>
than the want of it; for <HI>Ill Ta&s;te</HI> employs
more hands, and diffu&s;es Expence more
than a <HI>Good</HI> one. Is it a <HI>Moral</HI> Defect? No,
it is but a <HI>Natural</HI> one; a <HI>Want of Ta&s;te.</HI>
It is what the be&s;t good Man living may be
liable to: The worthie&s;t Peer may live ex|emplary
in an ill-favour'd Hou&s;e, and the
be&s;t reputed Citizen be plea&s;ed with a vile
Garden. I thought (I &s;ay) the Author had
<PB N="239" REF="235">
the common Liberty to ob&s;erve a Defect,
and to compliment a Friend for a Quality
that di&s;tingui&s;hes him: which I know not
how any Quality &s;hould do, if we were not
to remark that it was wanting in others.</P>
<P>But they &s;ay the Satire is <HI>Per&s;onal.</HI> I
thought it could not be &s;o, becau&s;e all its
Reflections are on <HI>Things.</HI> His Reflections
are not on the <HI>Man,</HI> but his Hou&s;e, Garden,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nay, he reflects (as one may &s;ay) the
<HI>Per&s;ons</HI> of the Gladiator, Amphitheatre, the
Nile, and the Triton: He is only &s;orry to
&s;ee them (as he might be to &s;ee any of his
<HI>Friends</HI>) ridiculous, by being in the wrong
Place, and in bad Company. Some fancy,
that to &s;ay a thing is <HI>Per&s;onal,</HI> is the &s;ame as
to &s;ay it is <HI>Inju&s;t,</HI> not con&s;idering that no|thing
can be <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> that is not <HI>Per&s;onal.</HI> I
am afraid that <Q REND="inline">"all &s;uch Writings and Di&s;|cour&s;es
as <HI>touch no Man,</HI> will <HI>mend no
Man.</HI>"</Q> The Good Natured, indeed, are
apt to be alarmed at any thing like Satire; and
the <HI>Guilty</HI> readily concur with the <HI>Weak</HI> for
a plain Rea&s;on, becau&s;e the Vicious look
upon Folly as their <HI>Frontier:</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;Jam &s;troximus ardet</L>
<L>Ucalegon&mdash;</L></Q>
No wonder tho&s;e who know Ridicule be|longs
to them, find an inward Con&s;olation
<PB N="240" REF="236">
in removing it from them&s;elves as far as they
can; and it is never &s;o far, as when they
can get it fixed on the <HI>be&s;t Characters.</HI> No
wonder tho&s;e who are Food for Satiri&s;ts
&s;hould rail at them as Creatures of Prey;
every Bea&s;t born for our U&s;e would be ready
to call a Man &s;o.</P>
<P>I know no Remedy, unle&s;s people in our
Age would as little frequent the Theatres,
as they begin to do the Churches; unle&s;s
Comedy were for&s;aken, Satire &s;ilent, and
every man left to do what &s;eems good in his
own Eyes, as if there were no King, no
Prie&s;t, no Poet in <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>But I find my&s;elf obliged to touch a
Point, on which I mu&s;t be more &s;erious; it
well de&s;erves I &s;hould: I mean the malicious
Application of the Character of <HI>Timon,</HI> which
I will boldly &s;ay, they would impute to the
Per&s;on the mo&s;t different in the World from
a <HI>Man-hater,</HI> and the Per&s;on who&s;e <HI>Ta&s;te</HI>
and <HI>Encouragement</HI> of <HI>Wit</HI> have often been
&s;hewn in the <HI>righte&s;t Place.</HI> The Author
of that Epi&s;tle mu&s;t certainly think &s;o, if
he has the &s;ame Opinion of his own Merit
as Authors generally have; for he has been
favoured by this very Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Why, in God's Name, mu&s;t a <HI>Portrait,</HI>
apparently collected from twenty different
Men, be apply'd to one only? Has it his
<HI>Eye?</HI> No, it is very unlike. Has it his <HI>No&s;e</HI>
<PB N="241" REF="237">
or <HI>Mouth?</HI> No, they are totally differing.
What then, I be&s;eech you? Why, it has the
<HI>Mole on his Chin.</HI> Very well; but mu&s;t the
Picture thereof be his, and has no other
man that blemi&s;h?</P>
<P>Could there be a more melancholy In|&s;tance
how much the Ta&s;te of the Publick is
vitiated, and turns the mo&s;t &s;alutary and &s;ea|&s;onable
Phy&s;ick into Poi&s;on, than if amid&s;t
the Blaze of thou&s;and bright Qualities in a
Great Man, they &s;hould only remark there is
a <HI>Shadow</HI> about him, as what Eminence is
without? I am confident the Author was
incapable of imputing any &s;uch to One,
who&s;e whole Life (to u&s;e his own Expre&s;&s;ion
in Print of him) is <HI>a continued Series</HI> of good
and generous Actions.</P>
<P>I know no man who would be more con|cerned,
if he gave the lea&s;t Pain or Offence
to any innocent Per&s;on; and none who
would be le&s;s concerned, if the Satire were
challenged by any one at whom he would
really aim it. If ever that happens, I dare
engage he will own it, with all the Free|dom
of one who&s;e <HI>Cen&s;ures</HI> are <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> and who
&s;ets his <HI>Name</HI> to them.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>March 7, 1731.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Clamour rais'd about my Epi&s;tle
to you, could not give me &s;o much
pain, as I receiv'd plea&s;ure in &s;eeing the
general Zeal of the world in the cau&s;e of a
great Man who is Beneficient, and the par|ticular
Warmth of your Lord&s;hip in that
of a private Man who is innocent.</P>
<P>It was not the <HI>Poem</HI> that de&s;erv'd this
from you; for as I had the Honour to be
your Friend, I cou'd not treat you quite like
a Poet: But &s;ure the <HI>Writer</HI> de&s;erv'd more
Candor, even from tho&s;e who knew him
not, than to promote a Report, which in re|gard
to that Noble Per&s;on was <HI>Impertinent</HI>;
in regard to me, <HI>Villainous.</HI> Yet I had no
great Cau&s;e to wonder, that a Character be|longing
to <HI>twenty</HI> &s;hou'd be applied to <HI>one</HI>;
&s;ince, by that means <HI>nineteen</HI> wou'd e&s;cape
the Ridicule.</P>
<P>I was too well content with my Know|ledge
of that Noble Per&s;on's Opinion in this
Affair, to trouble the publick about it. But
<PB N="243" REF="239">
&s;ince Malice and Mi&s;take are &s;o long a dy|ing,
I have taken the opportunity of a third
Edition to declare <HI>His Belief,</HI> not only of <HI>My
Innocence,</HI> but of <HI>Their Malignity,</HI> of the for|mer
of which my own Heart is as con&s;ci|ous,
as I fear &s;ome of theirs mu&s;t of the
latter. His Humanity feels a Concern for
the Injury done to <HI>Me,</HI> while His Greatne&s;s
of Mind can bear with Indifference the In|&s;ult
offer'd to <HI>Him&s;elf.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alludes to the Letter the Duke of <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> wrote to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> on this occa&s;ion, a Copy of which, together with Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s to his Grace, we hope to procure for the next Volume.</NOTE></P>
<P>However, my Lord, I own, that Critics of
<HI>this Sort</HI> can intimidate me, nay half incline
me to write no more: That wou'd be making
the Town a Compliment which I think it
de&s;erves; and which &s;ome, I am &s;ure, wou'd
take very kindly. This way of Satire is dan|gerous,
as long as Slander rais'd by Fools of
the lowe&s;t Rank can find any countenance
from tho&s;e of a Higher. Even from the
Conduct &s;hewn on this Occa&s;ion, I have
learnt there are &s;ome who wou'd rather be
<HI>wicked</HI> than <HI>ridiculous</HI>; and therefore it
may be &s;afer to attack <HI>Vices</HI> than <HI>Follies.</HI>
I will therefore leave my Betters in the
quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their <HI>Idols,</HI> their <HI>Groves,</HI>
and their <HI>High Places</HI>; and change my
<PB N="244" REF="240">
Subject from their <HI>Pride</HI> to their <HI>Mean|ne&s;s,</HI>
from their <HI>Vanities</HI> to their <HI>Mi&s;eries:</HI>
And as the only certain way to avoid Mi&s;|con&s;tructions,
to le&s;&s;en Offence, and not to
multiply illnatur'd Applications, I may pro|bably,
in my next, make u&s;e of <HI>Real</HI>
Names and not of Fictitious Ones.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This he did in his next Piece, which was the Epi&s;tle to the Lord <HI>Bathur&s;t</HI> of the u&s;e of Riches.</NOTE></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Hamp&s;tead, <DATE>July 17, 1734^o</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Little doubt of your kind Concern for
me, nor of that of the Lady you men|tion.
I have nothing to repay my Friends
with at pre&s;ent, but prayers and good
wi&s;hes. I have the &s;atisfaction to find that
I am as officiou&s;ly &s;erv'd by my Friends, as
he that has thou&s;ands to leave in Legacies;
be&s;ides the A&s;&s;urance of their Sincerity.
<PB N="245" REF="241">
God Almighty has made my bodily di&s;tre&s;s
as ea&s;y as a thing of that nature can be:
I have found &s;ome relief, at lea&s;t &s;ometimes,
from the Air of this Place. My Nights are
bad, but many poor Creatures have wor&s;e.</P>
<P>As for you, my good Friend, I think &s;ince
our fir&s;t acquaintance there has not been
any of tho&s;e little Su&s;picions or Jealou&s;ies
that often affect the &s;incere&s;t Friend&s;hips;
I am &s;ure not on my &s;ide. I mu&s;t be &s;o
&s;incere as to own, that tho' I could not help
valuing you for tho&s;e Talents which the
World prizes, yet they were not the Foun|dation
of my Friend&s;hip: They were quite
of another &s;ort; nor &s;hall I at pre&s;ent offend
you by enumerating them: And I make it
my la&s;t Reque&s;t, that you continue that no|ble
<HI>Di&s;dain</HI> and <HI>Abhorrence</HI> of Vice, which
you &s;eem naturally endu'd with, but &s;till
with a due regard to your own &s;afety; and
&s;tudy more to reform than cha&s;ti&s;e, tho'
the one often cannot be effected without the
other.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Bathur&s;t</HI> I have always honour'd for
every good Quality, that a Per&s;on of his
Rank ought to have: Pray give my Re&s;pects
and kinde&s;t Wi&s;hes to the Family. My Ve|ni&s;on
Stomach is gone, but I have tho&s;e a|bout
me, and often with me, who will
be very glad of his Pre&s;ent. If it is left
<PB N="246" REF="242">
at my Hou&s;e it will be tran&s;mitted &s;afe to
me.</P>
<P>A Recovery in my Ca&s;e, and at my Age,
is impo&s;&s;ible; the kinde&s;t Wi&s;h of my
Friends is <HI>Euthana&s;ia.</HI> Living or dying,
I &s;hall always be</P>
