<P>THE general de&s;ign of the following &s;heets is to
inli&s;t Imagination under the banner of Science; and to
lead her votaries from the loo&s;er analogies, which dre&s;s out
the imagery of poetry, to the &s;tricter, ones which form the
ratiocination of philo&s;ophy. While their particular de&s;ign
is to induce the ingenious to cultivate the knowledge of
Botany, by introducing them to the ve&s;tibule of that de|lightful
&s;cience, and recommending to their attention the
immortal works of the celebrated Swedi&s;h Naturali&s;t,
LINNEUS.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Poem, or Economy of Vegetation, the phy|&s;iology
of Plants is delivered; and the operation of the
Elements, as far as they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to affect the
growth of Vegetables. In the &s;econd Poem, or Loves of
the Plants, the Sexual Sy&s;tem of Linneus is explained,
with the remarkable properties of many particular plants.</P>

<HEAD>APOLOGY.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be proper here to apologize for many of the
&s;ub&s;equent conjectures on &s;ome articles of natural philo&s;ophy, as
not being &s;upported by accurate inve&s;tigation or conclu&s;ive experi|ments.
Extravagant theories however in tho&s;e parts of philo&s;ophy,
where our knowledge is yet imperfect, are not without their u&s;e;
as they encourage the execution of laborious experiments, or the
inve&s;tigation of ingeniou&s; deductions, to confirm or refute them.
And &s;ince natural objects are allied to each other by many affinities,
every kind of theoretic di&s;tribution of them add&s; to our knowledge
by developing &s;ome of their analogies.</P>
<P>The Ro&s;icrucian doctrine of Gnomes, Sylphs, Nymphs, and
Salamanders, was thought to afford a proper machinery for a
Botanic poem; as it is probable, that they were originally the
names of hieroglyphic figures repre&s;enting the elements.</P>
<P>Many of the important operations of Nature were &s;hadowed or
allegorized in the heathen mythology, as the fir&s;t Cupid &s;pringing
from the Egg of Night, the marriage of Cupid and P&s;yche, the Rape
of Pro&s;erpine, the Congre&s;s of Jupiter and Juno, Death and Re&s;u&s;|citation
of Adonis, &amp;c. many of which are ingeniou&s;ly explained in
the works of Bacon, Vol. V. p. 47. 4th Edit. London, 1778. The
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
Egyptians were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many di&s;coveries in philo&s;ophy and che|mi&s;try
before the invention of letters; the&s;e were then expre&s;&s;ed in
hieroglyphic paintings of men and animals; which after the di&s;|covery
of the alphabet were de&s;cribed and animated by the poets,
and became fir&s;t the deities of Egypt, and afterwards of Greece and
Rome. Allu&s;ions to tho&s;e fables were therefore thought proper orna|ments
to a philo&s;ophical poem, and are occa&s;ionally introduced
either as repre&s;ented by the poets, or pre&s;erved on the numerous
gems and medallions of antiquity.</P>

<L>I. "NYMPHS OF PRIMEVAL FIRE! YOUR ve&s;tal train<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Nymphs of primeval fire.</HI> l. 97. The fluid matter of heat is perhaps the mo&s;t exten|sive element in nature; all other bodies are immer&s;ed in it, and are pre&s;erved in their pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;olidity or fluidity by the attraction of their particles to the matter of heat. Since all known bodies are contractible into le&s;s &s;pace by depriving them of &s;ome portion of their heat, and as there is no part of nature totally deprived of heat, there is rea&s;on to believe that the particles of bodies do not touch, but are held towards each other by their &s;elf-attraction, and recede from each other by their attraction to the ma&s;s of heat which &s;urrounds them; and thus exi&s;t in an equilibrium between the&s;e two powers. If more of the matter of heat be applied to them, they recede further from each other, and become fluid; if &s;till more be applied, they take an aerial form, and are termed Ga&s;&s;es by the modern chemi&s;ts. Thus when water is heated to a certain degree, it would in&s;tantly a&s;&s;ume the form of &s;team, but for the pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo|sphere, which prevents this change from taking place &s;o ea&s;ily; the &s;ame is true of quick&s;ilver, diamonds, and of perhaps all other bodies in Nature; they would fir&s;t become fluid, and then aeriform by appropriated degrees of heat. On the contrary, this ela&s;tic matter of heat, termed Calorique in the new nomenclature of the French Academicians, is liable to become con&s;olidated it&s;elf in its combinations with &s;ome bodies, as perhaps in nitre, and probably in combu&s;tible bodies as &s;ulphur and char|coal. See note on l. 232, of this Canto. Modern philo&s;ophers have not yet been able to decide whether light and heat be different fluids, or modifications of the &s;ame fluid, as they have many properties in common.

See l. 419. of this Canto.</P>
<P>The external cru&s;t of the earth, as far as it has been expo&s;ed to our view in mines or mountains, countenances this opinion; &s;ince the&s;e have evidently for the mo&s;t part had their origin from the &s;hells of fi&s;hes, the decompo&s;ition of vegetables, and the recrements of other animal materials, and mu&s;t therefore have been formed progre&s;&s;ively from &s;mall beginnings. There are likewi&s;e &s;ome apparently u&s;ele&s;s or incomplete appendages to plants and animals, which &s;eem to &s;hew they have gradually undergone changes from their original &s;tate; &s;uch as the &s;tamens without anthers, and &s;tyles without &s;tigmas of several plants, as mentioned in the note on Curcuma, Vol. II. of this work. Such as the halteres, or rudiments of wings of &s;ome two-winged in&s;ects; and the paps of male animals; thus &s;wine have four toes, but two of them are imperfectly formed, and not long enough for u&s;e.

Mr. Her&s;chel has given a very &s;ublime and curious account of the con&s;truction of the heavens with his di&s;covery of &s;ome thou&s;and nebulae, or clouds of &s;tars; many of which are much larger collections of &s;tars, than all tho&s;e put together, which are vi&s;ible to our naked eyes, added to tho&s;e which form the galaxy, or milky zone, which &s;urrounds us. He ob&s;erves that in the vicinity of the&s;e clu&s;ters of stars there are proportionally fewer &s;tars than in other parts of the heavens; and hence he concludes, that they have attracted each other, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that infinite &s;pace was at fir&s;t equally &s;prinkled with them; as if it had at the beginning been filled with a fluid ma&s;s, which had coagulated. Mr. Her&s;chel has further &s;hewn, that the whole &s;idereal sy&s;tem is gradually moving round &s;ome centre, which may be an opake ma&s;s of matter, Philos. Trans. V. LXXIV. If all the&s;e Suns are moving round &s;ome great central body; they mu&s;t have had a projectile force, as well as a centripetal one; and may thence be suppo&s;ed to have emerged or been projected from the material, where they were produced. We can have no idea of a natural power, which could project a Sun out of Chaos, ex|cept by comparing it to the explo&s;ions or earthquakes owing to the &s;udden evolution of aqueous or of other more ela&s;tic vapours; of the power of which under immea&s;urable degrees of heat, and compre&s;&s;ion, we are yet ignorant.</P>
<P>It may be objected, that if the &s;tars had been projected from a Chaos by explo&s;ions, that they mu&s;t have returned again into it from the known laws of gravitation; this how|ever would not happen, if the whole of Chaos, like grains of gunpowder, was exploded at the &s;ame time, and di&s;per&s;ed through infinite &s;pace at once, or in quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in every po&s;&s;ible direction. The &s;ame objection may be &s;tated again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of the planets having been thrown from the fun by explo&s;ions; and the &s;econdary planets from the primary ones; which will be &s;poken of more at large in the &s;econd Canto, but if the planets are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been projected from their &s;uns, and the &s;econdary from the primary ones, at the beginning of their cour&s;e; they might be &s;o influenced or diverted by the attractions of the &s;uns, or &s;un, in their vicinity, as to prevent their tendency to return into the body, from which they were projected.</P>
<P>Is the&s;e innumerable and immen&s;e &s;uns thus ri&s;ing out of Chaos are &s;uppo&s;ed to have thrown out their attendant planets by new explo&s;ions, as they a&s;cended; and tho&s;e their re&s;pective &s;atellites, filling in a moment the immen&s;ity of &s;pace with light and motion, a grander idea cannot be conceived by the mind of man.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="105"></L>

Mr. Cavendi&s;h has &s;hewn, that the gas called inflam|mable air, is at lea&s;t ten times lighter than common air; Mr. Lavoi&s;ier contends, that it is one of the component parts of water, and is by him called hydrogene. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to afford their principal nouri&s;hment to vegetables and thence to animals, and is perpetually ri&s;ing from their decompo&s;ition; this &s;ource of it in hot climates, and in &s;ummer months, is &s;o great as to exceed e&s;timation. Now if this light gas pa&s;&s;es through the atmo&s;phere, without combining with it, it mu&s;t compo&s;e another atmo&s;phere over the aerial one; which mu&s;t expand, when the pre&s;&s;ure above it is thus taken away, to inconceivable tenuity.</P>
<P>If this &s;upernatural ga&s;&s;eous atmo&s;phere floats upon the aerial one, like ether upon water, what mu&s;t happen? l. it will flow from the line, where it will be produced in the greate&s;t quantities, and become much accumulated over the poles of the earth; 2. the common air, or lower &s;tratum of the atmo&s;phere, will be much thinner over the poles than at the line; becau&s;e if a gla&s;s globe be filled with oil and water, and whirled upon its axis, the centrifugal power will carry the heavier fluid to the circumference, and the lighter will in con&s;equence be found round the axis. 3. There may be a place at &s;ome certain latitude between the poles and the line on each &s;ide the equator, where the inflammable &s;upernatant atmo&s;phere may end, owing to the greater centrifugal force of the heavier aerial atmo&s;phere. 4. Between the termination of the aerial and the beginning of the ga&s;&s;eous atmo&s;phere, the airs will occa&s;ionally be intermixed, and thus become inflam|mable by the electric &s;park; the&s;e circum&s;tances will a&s;&s;i&s;t in explaining the phenomena of fire-balls, northern lights, and of &s;ome variable winds, and long continued rains.</P>

The duration of twilight differs in different &s;ea&s;ons and in different latitudes; in England the &s;horte&s;t twilight is about the beginning of October and of March; in more northern latitudes, where the &s;un never finks more than 18 degrees, below the horizon, the twilight continues the whole night.

This mu&s;t fir&s;t produce by its coldne&s;s a conden&s;ation of the vapour there exi&s;ting, or a vacuum, and thus occa&s;ion parts of the earth's cru&s;t or &s;hell to be forced down by the pre&s;&s;ure of the incumbent at|mo&s;phere. Afterwards the water being &s;uddenly rai&s;ed into &s;team produces all the explo&s;ive effects of earthquakes.

<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e eruptions occa&s;ioned by the &s;team of water, there &s;eems to be a perpetual effu&s;ion of other vapours, more noxious and (as far as it is yet known) perhaps greatly more expan&s;ile than water from the Volcanos in various parts of the world. As the&s;e Volcanos are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;piracula or breathing holes to the great &s;ubterraneous fires, it is probable that the e&s;cape of ela&s;tic vapours from them is the cau&s;e, that the earth|quakes of modern days are of &s;uch &s;mall extent compared to tho&s;e of antient times, of which ve&s;tiges remain in every part of the world, and on this account may be &s;aid not only to be innocuous, but u&s;eful.</P></NOTE></L>

The air, like all other bad conductors of electricity, is known to be a bad conductor of heat; and thence prevents the heat acquired from the &s;un's rays by the earth's &s;urface from being &s;o &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated, in the &s;ame manner as a blanket, which may be con&s;idered as a &s;ponge filled with air, prevents the e&s;cape of heat from the per&s;on wrapped in it. This &s;eems to be one cau&s;e of the great degree of cold on the tops of mountains, where the rarity of the air is greater, and it therefore be|comes a better conductor both of heat and electricity. See note on Barometz, Vol. II. of this work.</P>
<P>There is however another cau&s;e to which the great coldne&s;s of mountains and of the higher regions of the atmo&s;phere is more immediately to be a&s;cribed, explained by Dr. Darwin in the Philos. Tran&s;. Vol. LXXVIII. who has there proved by experiments with the air-gun and air-pump, that when any portion of the atmo&s;phere becomes mechanically expanded, it ab&s;orbs heat from the bodies in its vicinity. And as the air which creeps along the plains, expands it&s;elf by a part of the pre&s;&s;ure being taken off when it a&s;cends the &s;ides of mountains; it at the &s;ame time attracts heat from the &s;ummits of tho&s;e mountains, or other bodies which happen to be immer&s;ed in it, and thus produces cold. Hence he concludes that the hot air at the bottom of the Andes becomes temperate by its own rarefaction when it a&s;cents to the city of Quito; and by its further rarefaction becomes cooled to the freezing point when it a&s;cends to the &s;nowy regions on the &s;um|mits of tho&s;e mountains. To this al&s;o he attributes the great degree of cold experienced by the aeronauts in their balloons; and which produces hail in &s;ummer at the height of only two or three miles in the atmo&s;phere.</P></NOTE></L>

I have often been induced to believe from ob&s;ervation, that the twilight of the evenings is lighter than that of the mornings at the &s;ame di&s;tance from noon. Some may a&s;cribe this to the greater height of the atmo&s;phere in the even|ings having been rarefied by the &s;un during the day; but as its den&s;ity mu&s;t at the &s;ame time be dimini&s;hed, its power of refraction would continue the &s;ame. I &s;hould rather &s;uppo&s;e that it may be owing to the pho&s;phore&s;cent quality (as it is called) of almo&s;t all bodies; that is, when they have been expo&s;ed to the &s;un they continue to emit light for a con&s;iderable time afterwards. This is generally believed to ari&s;e either from &s;uch bodies giving out the light which they had previou&s;ly ab&s;orbed; or to the continuance of a &s;low combu&s;tion which the light they had been previou&s;ly expo&s;ed to had excited.

It appears from the&s;e experiments, that almo&s;t all inflammable bodies po&s;&s;e&s;s this quality in a greater or le&s;s degree; white paper or linen thus examined after having been expo&s;ed to the &s;un&s;hine, is luminous to an extraordinary degree; and if a per&s;on &s;hut up in a dark room, puts one of his hands out into the &s;un's light for a &s;hort time and then retracts it, he will be able to &s;ee that hand di&s;tinctly, and not the other. The&s;e experiments &s;eem to countenance the idea of light being ab&s;orbed and again emitted from bodies when they are removed into darkne&s;s. But Beccari further pretended, that &s;ome calcareous compo&s;itions when expo&s;ed to red, yellow, or blue light, through coloured gla&s;&s;es, would on their being brought into a dark room emit coloured lights. This mi&s;taken fact of Beccari's, Mr. Wil&s;on decidedly refutes; and among many other curious experiments di&s;covered, that if oy&s;ter-&s;hells were thrown into a common fire and calcined for about half an hour, and then brought to a per&s;on who had previou&s;ly been &s;ome minutes in a dark room, that many of them would exhibit beautiful iri&s;es of pri&s;matic colours, from whence probably aro&s;e Beccari's mi&s;take. Mr. Wil&s;on from hence contends, that the&s;e kinds of pho&s;phori do not emit the light they had previou&s;ly received, but that they are &s;et on fire by the &s;un's rays, and continue for &s;ome time a &s;low combu&s;tion after they are withdrawn from the light.

putting one finger on the back near its head, and another of the oppo&s;ite hand into the
water near its tail. In their native country they are &s;aid to exceed twenty feet in length,
and kill any man who approaches them in an ho&s;tile manner. It is not only to e&s;cape its
enemies that this &s;urprizing power of the fi&s;h is u&s;ed, but al&s;o to take its prey; which
it does by benumbing them and then devouring them before they have time to recover,
or by perfectly killing them; for the quantity of the power &s;eemed to be determined by
the will or anger of the animal; as it &s;ometimes &s;truck a fi&s;h twice before it was &s;uf|ficiently

the more electricity can be conden&s;ed on one of its &s;urfaces, till it becomes &s;o thin as to

power of attraction is known to decrea&s;e as the &s;quares of the di&s;tances, to which this cir|cum&s;tance

For many ages it is probable fire was e&s;teemed a dangerous enemy, known only by its dreadful deva&s;tations; and that many lives mu&s;t have been lo&s;t, and many dangerous burns and wounds mu&s;t have afflicted tho&s;e who fir&s;t dared to &s;ubject it to the u&s;es of life. It is &s;aid that the tall monkies of Borneo and Sumatra lie down with plea&s;ure ruond any accidental fire in their woods; and are arrived to that degree of rea&s;on, that knowledge of cau&s;ation, that they thru&s;t into the remaining fire the half-burnt ends of the branches to prevent its going out. One of the nobles of the cultivated people of Otaheita, when Captain Cook treated them with tea, catched the boiling water in his hand from the cock of the tea-urn, and bellowed with pain, not conceiving that water could become hot, like red fire.</P>
<P>Tools of &s;teel con&s;titute another important di&s;covery in con&s;equence of fire; and contributed perhaps principally to give the European nations &s;o great &s;uperiority over the American world. By the&s;e two agents, fire and tools of &s;teel, mankind became able to cope with the vegetable kingdom, and conquer provinces of fore&s;ts, which in uncul|tivated countries almo&s;t exclude the growth of other vegetables, and of tho&s;e animals which are nece&s;&s;ary to our exi&s;tence. Add to this, that the quantity of our food is al&s;o increa&s;ed by the u&s;e of fire, for &s;ome vegetables become &s;alutary food by means of the heat u&s;ed in cookery, which are naturally either noxious or difficult of dige&s;tion; as potatoes, kidney-beans, onions, cabbages.

The phenomena of chemical explo&s;ions cannot be accounted for without the &s;uppo&s;ition, that &s;ome of the bodies employed contain concentrated or &s;olid heat combined with them, to which the French Chemi&s;ts have given the name of Calorique. When air is expanded in the air-pump, or water evaporated into &s;team, they drink up or ab&s;orb a great quantity of heat; from this analogy, when gunpowder is ex|ploded it ought to ab&s;orb much heat, that is, in popular language, it ought to produce a great quantity of cold. When vital air is united with phlogi&s;tic matter in re&s;piration, which &s;eems to be a &s;low combu&s;tion, its volume is le&s;&s;ened; the carbonic acid, and per|haps pho&s;phoric acid are produced; and heat is given out; which according to the ex|periments of Dr. Crawford would &s;eem to be depo&s;ited from the vital air. But as the vital air in nitrous acid is conden&s;ed from a light ela&s;tic gas to that of a heavy fluid, it mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s heat than before. And hence a great part of the heat, which is given out in firing gunpowder, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, mu&s;t re&s;ide in the &s;ulphur or charcoal.</P>
<P>Mr. Lavoi&s;ier has &s;hewn, that vital air, or Oxygene, loo&s;es le&s;s of its heat when it becomes one of the component parts of nitrous acid, than in any other of its combinations; and is hence capable of giving out a great quantity of heat in the explo&s;ion of gunpowder; but as there &s;eems to be great analogy between the matter of heat, or Calorique, and the electric matter; and as the wor&s;t conductors of electricity are believed to contain the greate&s;t quantity of that fluid; there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that the wor&s;t conductors of heat may contain the mo&s;t of that fluid; as &s;ulphur, wax, &s;ilk, air, gla&s;s.

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>And clo&s;e an airy ocean.</HI> l. 242. Gunpowder is plainly de&s;cribed in the works of Roger Bacon before the year 1267. He de&s;cribes it in a curious manner, mentioning the &s;ulphur and nitre, but conceals the charcoal in an anagram. The words are, &s;ed tamen &s;alis petrae <HI>lure mope can ubre,</HI> et &s;ulphuris; et &s;ic facies tonitrum, et corru&s;ca|tionem, &s;i &s;cias, artificium. The words lure mope can ubre are an anagram of carbonum pulvere. Biograph. Britan. Vol. I. Bacon de Secretis Operibus, Cap. XI. He adds, that he thinks by an artifice of this kind Gideon defeated the Midianites with only three hundred men. Judges, Chap. VII. Chamb. Dict. art. Gunpowder. As Bacon does not claim this as his own invention, it is thought by many to have been of much more antient di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The permanently ela&s;tic fluid generated in the firing of gunpowder is calculated by Mr. Robins to be about 244 if the bulk of the powder be I. And that the heat gene|rated at the time of the explo&s;ion occa&s;ions the rarefied air thus produced to occupy about 1000 times the &s;pace of the gunpowder. This pre&s;&s;ure may therefore be called equal to 1000 atmo&s;pheres or &s;ix tons upon a &s;quare inch. As the &s;uddenne&s;s of this explo&s;ion mu&s;t contribute much to its power, it would &s;eem that the chamber of powder, to produce its greate&s;t effect, &s;hould be lighted in the centre of it; which I believe is not attended to in the manufacture of mu&s;kets or pi&s;tols.</P>
<P>From the cheapne&s;s with which a very powerful gunpowder is likely &s;oon to be manufactured from aerated marine acid, or from a new method of forming nitrous acid by means of mangone&s;e or other calciform ores, it may probably in time be applied to move machinery, and &s;uper&s;ede the u&s;e of &s;team.</P>
<P>There is a bitter invective in Don Quixot again&s;t the inventors of gun-powder, as it levels the &s;trong with the weak, the knight ca&s;ed in &s;teel with the naked &s;hepherd, tho&s;e who have been trained to the &s;word, with tho&s;e who are totally un&s;kilful in the u&s;e of it; and throws down all the &s;plendid di&s;tinctions of mankind.

The invention of the &s;team-engine for rai&s;ing water by the pre&s;&s;ure of the air in con&s;equence of the conden&s;ation of &s;team, is properly a&s;cribed to Capt. Savery; a plate and de&s;cription of this machine is given in Harris's Lexicon Technicum, art. Engine. Though the Marquis of Worce&s;ter in his Century of Inventions printed in the year 1663 had de&s;cribed an engine for rai&s;ing water by the explo&s;ive power of &s;team long before Savery's. Mr. De&s;egulier affirms, that Savery bought up all he could procure of the books of the Marquis of Worce&s;ter, and de&s;troyed them, profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf then to have di&s;covered the power of &s;team by accident, which &s;eems to have been an unfounded &s;lander. Savery applied it to the rai&s;ing of water to &s;upply hou&s;es and gardens, but could not accompli&s;h the draining of mines by it. Which was after|wards done by Mr. Newcomen and Mr. John Cowley at Dartmouth, in the year 1712, who added the pi&s;ton.</P>
<P>A few years ago Mr. Watt of Gla&s;gow much improved this machine, and with Mr. Boulton of Birmingham has applied it to variety of purpo&s;es, &s;uch as rai&s;ing water from mines, blowing bellows to fu&s;e the ore, &s;upplying towns with water, grinding corn and many other purpo&s;es. There is rea&s;on to believe it may in time be applied to the row|ing of barges, and the moving of carriages along the road. As the &s;pecific levity of air is too great for the &s;upport of great burthens by balloons, there &s;eems no probable method of flying conveniently but by the power of &s;team, or &s;ome other explo&s;ive material; which another half century may probable di&s;cover.

Yet if we may compare the parts of nature with each other, there are &s;ome circum&s;tances of her economy which &s;eem to contribute more to the general &s;cale of happine&s;s than others. Thus the nouri&s;hment of animal bodies is derived from three &s;ources: 1. the milk given from the mother to the off&s;pring; in this excellent contrivance the mother has plea&s;ure in affording the &s;u&s;te|nance to the child, and the child has plea&s;ure in receiving it. 2. Another &s;ource of the food of animals includes &s;eeds or eggs; in the&s;e the embryon is in a torpid or in&s;en&s;ible &s;tate, and there is along with it laid up for its early nouri&s;hment a &s;tore of provi&s;ion, as the fruit belonging to &s;ome &s;eeds, and the oil and &s;tarch belonging to others; when the&s;e are con&s;umed by animals the unfeeling &s;eed or egg receives no pain, but the animal receives plea&s;ure which con&s;umes it. Under this article may be included the bodies of animals which die naturally. 3. But the la&s;t method of &s;upporting animal bodies by the de&s;truction of other living animals, as lions preying upon lambs, the&s;e upon living vege|tables, and mankind upon them all, would appear to be a le&s;s perfect part of the economy of nature than tho&s;e before mentioned, as contributing le&s;s to the &s;um of general happi|ne&s;s.</P></NOTE></L>

The &s;tory of Hercules &s;eems of great antiquity, as appears from the &s;implicity of his dre&s;s and armour, a lion's &s;kin and a club; and from the nature of many of his exploits, the de&s;truction of wild bea&s;ts and robbers. This part of the hi&s;tory of Hercules &s;eems to have related to times before the invention of the bow and arrow, or of &s;pinning flax. Other &s;tories of Hercules are perhaps of later date, and appear to be allegorical, as his conquering the river-god Achilous, and bringing Cerberus up to day light; the former might refer to his turning the cour&s;e of a river, and draining a mora&s;s, and the latter to his expo&s;ing a part of the &s;uper&s;tition of the times. The &s;trangling the lion and tearing his jaws a&s;under, are de&s;cribed from a &s;tatue in the Mu&s;eum Florentinum, and from an antique gem; and the gra&s;ping Anteus to death in his arms as he lifts him from the earth, is de&s;cribed from another antient cameo. The famous pillars of Hercules have been variou&s;ly explained. Pliny a&s;&s;erts that the natives of Spain and of Africa believed that the mountains of Abyla and Calp&egrave; on each &s;ide of the &s;traits of Gibraltar were the pillars of Hercules; and that they were reared by the hands of that god, and the &s;ea admitted between them. Plin. Hi&s;t. Nat. p. 46. Edit. Manut. Venet. 1609.</P>
<P>If the pa&s;&s;age between the two continents was opened by an earthquake in antient times, as this allegorical &s;tory would &s;eem to countenance, there mu&s;t have been an im|men&s;e current of water at fir&s;t run into the Mediterranean from the Atlantic; &s;ince there is at pre&s;ent a &s;trong &s;tream &s;ets always from thence into the Mediterranean. Whatever may be the cau&s;e, which now con&s;tantly operates, &s;o as to make the &s;urface of the Mediterranean lower than that of the Atlantic, it mu&s;t have kept it very much lower before a pa&s;&s;age for the water through the &s;treights was opened. It is probable before &s;uch an event took place, the coa&s;ts and i&s;lands of the Mediterranean extended much further into that &s;ea, and were then for a great extent of country, de&s;troyed by the floods occa&s;ioned by the new ri&s;e of water, and have &s;ince remained beneath the &s;ea.

<L>VII. 1. NYMPHS! YOUR fine hands ethereal floods ama&s;s<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Ethereal floods ama&s;s.</HI> l. 335. The theory of the accumulation of the electric fluid by means of the gla&s;s-globe and cu&s;hion is difficult to comprehend. Dr. Franklin's idea of the pores of the gla&s;s being opened by the friction, and thence rendered capable of attracting more electric fluid, which it again parts with, as the pores contract again, feems analogous in &s;ome mea&s;ure to the heat produced by the vibration, or conden&s;ation of bodies, as when a nail is hammered or filed till it becomes hot, as mentioned in ad|ditional Notes, No. VII. Some philo&s;ophers have endeavoured to account for this phe|nomenon by &s;uppo&s;ing the exi&s;tence of two electric fluids which may be called the vitreous and re&s;inous ones, in&s;tead of the plus and minus of the &s;ame ether, But its accumulation on the rubbed gla&s;s bears great analogy to its accumulation on the &s;urface of the Leyden bottle, and can not perhaps be explained from any known mechanical or chemical principle.

This great di&s;covery taught us to defend hou&s;es and &s;hips and temples from lightning, and al&s;o to under&s;tand, <HI>that people are always perfectly &s;afe in a room during a thunder &s;torm if they keep them&s;elves at three or four feet di&s;tance from the walls;</HI> for the matter of lightning in pa&s;&s;ing from the clouds to the earth, or from the earth to the clouds, runs through the walls of a hou&s;e, the trunk of a tree, or other elevated object; except there be &s;ome moi&s;ter body, as an animal in con|tact with them, or nearly &s;o; and in that ca&s;e the lightning leaves the wall or tree, and pa&s;&s;es through the animal; but as it can pa&s;s through metals with &s;till greater facility, it will leave animal bodies to pa&s;s through metallic ones.</P>

<L>YOUR VIRGIN TRAINS the tran&s;ient HEAT di&s;part,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Tran&s;ient heat di&s;part.</HI> l. 401. Dr. Crawford in his ingenious work on animal heat has endeavoured to prove, that during the combination of the pure part of the atmo&s;phere with the phlogi&s;tic part of the blood, that much of the matter of the heat is given out from the air; and that this is the great and perpetual &s;ource of the heat of animals; to which we may add that the pho&s;phoric acid is probably produced by this combination; by which acid the colour of the blood is changed in the lungs from a deep crim&s;on to a bright &s;carlet. There &s;eems to be however another &s;ource of animal heat, though of a &s;imilar nature; and that is from the chemical combinations produced in all the glands; &s;ince by whatever cau&s;e any glandular &s;ecretion is increa&s;ed, as by friction or topical imflam|mation, the heat of that part becomes increa&s;ed at the &s;ame time; thus after the hands have been for a time immer&s;ed in &s;now, on coming into a warm room, they become red and hot, without any increa&s;ed pulmonary action. BESIDES THIS there would &s;eem to be another material received from the air by re&s;piration; which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to life, that the embryon mu&s;t learn to breath almo&s;t within a minute after its birth, or it dies. The perpetual nece&s;&s;ity of breathing &s;hews, that the material thus acquired is per|petually con&s;uming or e&s;caping, and on that account requires perpetual renovation. Per|haps the &s;pirit of animation it&s;elf is thus acquired from the atmo&s;phere, which if it be &s;uppo&s;ed to be finer or more &s;ubtle than the electric matter, could not long be retained in our bodies, and mu&s;t therefore require perpetual renovation.</P></NOTE></L>

W. winds con&s;i&s;t of regions of air brought from the &s;outh, which appear to acquire a we&s;terly direction as they advance. The &s;urface of the earth nearer the pole moves &s;lower than it does in our latitude; whence the regions of air brought from thence, move &s;lower, when they arrive hither, than the earth's &s;urface with which they now become in contact; that is they acquire an apparent ea&s;terly direction, as the earth moves from we&s;t to ea&s;t fa&s;ter than this new part of its atmo&s;phere. The S. W. winds on the contrary con&s;i&s;t of regions of air brought from the &s;outh, where the &s;urface of the earth moves fa&s;ter than in our latitude; and have therefore a we&s;terly direction when they arrive hither by their moving fa&s;ter than the &s;urface of the earth, with which they are in contact; and in general the nearer to the we&s;t and the greater the velocity of the&s;e winds the warmer they &s;hould be in re&s;pect to the &s;ea&s;on of the year, &s;ince they have been brought more expeditiou&s;ly from the South, than tho&s;e winds which have le&s;s we&s;terly direction, and have thence been le&s;s cooled in their pa&s;&s;age.</P>

The principal injury done to vegetation by fro&s;t is from the expan&s;ion of the water contained in the ve&s;&s;els of plants. Water converted into ice occupies a greater &s;pace than it did before, as appears by the bur&s;ting of bottles filled with water at the time of their freezing. Hence fro&s;t de&s;troys tho&s;e plants of our i&s;land fir&s;t, which are mo&s;t &s;ucculent; and the mo&s;t &s;ucculent parts fir&s;t of other plants; as their leaves and la&s;t year's &s;hoots; the ve&s;&s;els of which are di&s;tended and bur&s;t by the ex|pan&s;ion of their freezing fluids, while the drier or more re&s;inous plants, as pines, yews, laurels, and other ever-greens, are le&s;s liable to injury from cold. The trees in vallies are on this account more injured by the vernal fro&s;ts than tho&s;e on eminencies, becau&s;e their early &s;ucculent &s;hoots come out &s;ooner. Hence fruit trees covered by a &s;ix-inch coping of a wall are le&s;s injured by the vernal fro&s;ts becau&s;e their being &s;hielded from &s;howers and the de&s;cending night-dews has prevented them from being moi&s;t at the time of their being frozen: which circum&s;tance has given occa&s;ion to a vulgar error among&s;t gardeners, who &s;uppo&s;e fro&s;t to de&s;cend.</P>
<P>As the common heat of the earth in this climate is 48 degrees, tho&s;e tender trees which will bear bending down, are ea&s;ily &s;ecured from the fro&s;t by &s;preading them upon the ground, and covering them with &s;traw or fern.

The buds and bulbs of plants con&s;titute what is termed by Linneus the Hybernaculum, or winter cradle of the embryon vegetable. The buds ari&s;e from the bark on the branches of trees, and the bulbs from the caudex of bulbous-rooted plants, or the part from which the fibres of the root are produced, they are de|fended from too much moi&s;ture, and from fro&s;ts, and from the depredations of in&s;ects by various contrivances, as by &s;cales, hairs, re&s;inous varni&s;hes, and by acrid rinds.</P>
<P>The buds of trees are of two kinds, either flower-buds or leaf buds; the former of the&s;e produce their &s;eeds and die; the latter produce other leaf buds or flower buds and die. So that all the buds of trees may be con&s;idered as annual plants, having their em|bryon produced during the preceeding &s;ummer. The &s;ame &s;eems to happen with re&s;pect to bulbs; thus a tulip produces annually one flower-bearing bulb, &s;ometimes two, and &s;everal leaf-bearing bulbs; and then the old root peri&s;hes.

The fluid matter of heat, or Calorique, in which all bodies are immer&s;ed, is as nece&s;&s;ary to vegetable as to animal exi&s;tence. It is not yet determin|able whether heat and light be different materials, or modifications of the &s;ame materials, as they have &s;ome properties in common. They appear to be both of them equally ne|ce&s;&s;ary to vegetable health, &s;ince without light green vegetables become fir&s;t yellow, that is, they lo&s;e the blue colour, which contributed to produce the green; and afterwards they al&s;o lo&s;e the yellow and become white; as is &s;een in cellery blanched or etiolated for the table by excluding the light from it.</P>
<P>The upper &s;urface of leaves, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be their organ of re&s;piration, &s;eems to require light as well as air; &s;ince plants which grow in windows on the in&s;ide of hou&s;es are equally &s;ollicitous to turn the upper &s;ide of their leaves to the light. Vegetables at the &s;ame time ex&s;ude or per&s;pire a great quantity from their leaves, as animals do from their lungs; this per&s;pirable matter as it ri&s;es from their fine ve&s;&s;els, (perhaps much finer than the pores of animal &s;kins,) is divided into inconcievable tenuity; and when acted upon by the Sun's light appears to be decompo&s;ed; the hydrogene becomes a part of the vegetable, compo&s;ing oils or re&s;ins; and the Oxygene combined with light or calo|rique a&s;cends, producing the pure part of the atmo&s;phere or vital air. Hence during the light of the day vegetables give up more pure air than their re&s;piration injures; but not &s;o in the night, even though equally expo&s;ed to warmth. This &s;ingle fact would &s;eem to &s;hew, that light is e&s;&s;entially different from heat; and it is perhaps by its combination with bodies, that their combined or latent heat is &s;et at liberty, and becomes &s;en&s;ible.

<P>Since by the late di&s;coveries or opinions of the Chemi&s;ts there is rea&s;on to believe that water is decompo&s;ed in the ve&s;&s;els of vegetables; and that the Hydrogene or inflam|mable air, of which it in part con&s;i&s;ts, contributes to the nouri&s;hment of the plant, and to the production of its oils, ro&s;ins, gums, &s;ugar, &amp;c. and la&s;tly as electricity decompo&s;es water into the&s;e two airs termed Oxygene and Hydrogene, there is a powerful analogy to induce us to believe that it accelerates or contributes to the growth of vegetation, and like heat may po&s;&s;ibly enter into combination with many bodies, or form the ba&s;is of &s;ome yet unanali&s;ed acid.</P></NOTE></L>

There are many rea&s;ons to believe from the accounts of travellers and navigators, that the i&s;lands of ice in the higher northern latitudes as well as the Glaciers on the Alps continue perpetually to increa&s;e in bulk. At certain times in the ice-mountains of Switzerland there happen cracks which have &s;hewn the great thickne&s;s of the ice, as &s;ome of the&s;e cracks have mea&s;ured three or four hundred ells deep. The great i&s;lands of ice in the northern &s;eas near Hud&s;on's bay have been ob|&s;erved to have been immer&s;ed above one hundred fathoms beneath the &s;urface of the &s;ea, and to have ri&s;en a fifth or &s;ixth part above the &s;urface, and to have mea&s;ured between three and four miles in circumference. Phil. Trans. No. 465. Sect. 2.</P>
<P>Dr. Li&s;ter endeavoured to &s;hew that the ice of &s;ea-water contains &s;ome &s;alt and per|haps le&s;s air than common ice, and that it is therefore much more difficult of &s;olution; whence he accounts for the perpetual and great increa&s;e of the&s;e floating i&s;lands of ice. Philos. Trans. No. 169.</P>
<P>As by a famous experiment of Mr. Boyles it appears that ice evaporates very fa&s;t in &s;evere fro&s;ty weather when the wind blows upon it; and as ice in a thawing &s;tate is known to contain &s;ix times more cold than water at the &s;ame degree of &s;en&s;ible coldne&s;s, it is ea&s;y to under&s;tand that winds blowing over i&s;lands and continents of ice perhaps much below nothing on Farenheit's &s;cale, and coming from thence into our latitude mu&s;t bring great degrees of cold along with them. If we add to this the quantity of cold pro|duced by the evaporation of the water as well as by the &s;olution of the ice, we cannot doubt but that the northern ice is the principle &s;ource of the coldne&s;s of our winters, and that it is brought hither by the regions of air blowing from the north, and which take an apparent ea&s;terly direction by their coming to a part of the &s;urface of the earth which moves fa&s;ter than the latitude they come from. Hence the increa&s;e of the ice in the polar regions by increa&s;ing the cold of our climate adds at the &s;ame time to the bulk of the Glaciers of Italy and Switzerland.</P>
<P>If the nations who inhabit this hemi&s;phere of the globe, in&s;tead of de&s;troying their &s;ea-men and exhau&s;ting their wealth in unnece&s;&s;ary wars, could be induced to unite their labours to navigate the&s;e immen&s;e ma&s;&s;es of ice into the more &s;outhern oceans, two great advantages would re&s;ult to mankind, the tropic countries would be much cooled by their &s;olution, and our winters in this latitude would be rendered much milder for perhaps a century or two, till the ma&s;&s;es of ice became again enormous.</P>

If the nucleus of the earth was thrown out from the &s;un by an explo&s;ion along with as large a quantity of &s;urrounding hot vapour as its attraction would occa&s;ion to accompany it, the ponderous &s;emi-fluid nucleus would take a &s;pherical form&punc; the attraction of its own parts, which would become an oblate &s;pheroid from its diurnal revolution.

The nucleus of the earth, &s;till covered with water, received perpetual increa&s;e by the immen&s;e quantities of &s;hells and coralloids either annually produced and relinqui&s;hed, or left after the death of the animals. The&s;e would gradually by their different degrees of cohe&s;ion be &s;ome of them more and others le&s;s removable by the influence of &s;olar tides, and gentle tropical breezes, which then mu&s;t have probably extended from one pole to the other; for it is &s;uppo&s;ed the moon was not yet produced, and that no &s;torms or unequal winds had yet exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Hence then the primeval i&s;lands had their gradual origin, were rai&s;ed but a few feet above the level of the &s;ea, and were not expo&s;ed to the great or &s;udden variations of heat and cold, as is &s;o well explained in Mr. Whithur&s;t's Theory of the Earth, chap. xvi. Whence the paradi&s;e of the &s;acred writers, and the golden age of the profane ones, &s;eems to have had a real exi&s;tence. As there can be no rainbow, when the heavens are covered with clouds, becau&s;e the &s;un-beams are then precluded from falling upon the rain-drops oppo&s;ite to the eye of the &s;pectator, the rainbow is a mark of gentle or partial &s;howers. Mr. Whitehur&s;t has endeavoured to &s;how that the primitive i&s;lands were only moi&s;tened by nocturnal dews and not by &s;howers, as occurs at this day to the Delta of Egypt; and is thence of opinion, that the rainbow had no exi&s;tence till after the production of mountains and continents. As the &s;alt of the &s;ea has been gradually accumulating, being wa&s;hed down into it from the recrements of animal and vegetable bodies, the &s;ea mu&s;t originally have been as fre&s;h as river water; and as it is not yet &s;aturated with &s;alt, mu&s;t become annually more &s;aline.

As the earth before the exi&s;tence of earthquakes was nearly level, and the greate&s;t part of it covered with &s;ea; when the fir&s;t great fires began deep in the internal parts of it, tho&s;e parts would become much expanded; this expan&s;ion would be gradually extended, as the heat increa&s;ed, through the whole terraqueous globe of 7000 miles diameter; the cru&s;t would thence in many places open into fi&s;&s;ures, which by admitting the &s;ea to flow in upon the fire, would produce not only a quantity of &s;team beyond calculation by its expan&s;ion, but would al&s;o by its decompo&s;ition produce inflammable air and vital air in quantities beyond conception, &s;ufficient to effect tho&s;e violent explo&s;ions, the ve&s;tiges of which all over the world excite our admiration and our &s;tudy; the difficulty of under&s;tanding how &s;ubterraneous fires could exi&s;t without the pre&s;ence of air has di&s;appeared &s;ince Dr. Prie&s;tley's di&s;coveries of &s;uch great quantities of pure air which con&s;titute all the acids, and con&s;equently exi&s;t in all &s;aline bodies, as &s;ea-&s;alt, nitre, lime-&s;tone, and in all calciform ores, as mangane&s;e, calamy, ochre, and other mineral &s;ub&s;tances.

<P>In the&s;e fir&s;t tremendous ignitions of the globe, as the continents were heaved up, the vallies, which now hold the &s;ea, were formed by the earth &s;ub&s;iding into the cavities made by the ri&s;ing mountains; as the &s;team, which rai&s;ed them conden&s;ed; which would thence not have any caverns of great extent remain beneath them, as &s;ome philo&s;ophers have imagined. The earthquakes of modern days are of very &s;mall extent indeed compared to tho&s;e of antient times, and are ingeniou&s;ly compared by M.

If the moon had no atmo&s;phere at the time of its elevation from the earth; or if its atmo&s;phere was afterwards &s;tolen from it by the earth's attraction; the water on the moon would ri&s;e quickly into vapour; and the cold produced by a certain quantity of this evaporation would congeal the remainder of it. Hence it is not probable that the moon is at pre&s;ent inhabited, but as it &s;eems to have &s;uffered and to continue to &s;uffer much by volcanos, a &s;ufficient quantity of air may in proce&s;s of time be generated to produce an atmo&s;phere; which may prevent its heat from &s;o ea&s;ily e&s;caping, and its water from &s;o ea&s;ily evaporating, and thence become fit for the production of vegetables and animals.</P>
<P>That the moon po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es little or no atmo&s;phere is deduced from the undimini&s;hed lu&s;tre of the &s;tars, at the in&s;tant when they emerge from behind her di&s;k. That the ocean of the moon is frozen, is confirmed from there being no appearance of lunar tides; which, if they exi&s;ted, would cover the part of her di&s;k neare&s;t the earth.

On &s;uppo&s;ition that the moon was thrown from the earth by the explo&s;ion of water or the generation of other vapours of greater power, the re|maining part of the globe would recede from its orbit in one direction as the moon receded in another, and that in proportion to the re&s;pective momentum of each, and would afterwards revolve round their common centre of gravity.</P>
<P>If the moon ro&s;e from any part of the earth except exactly at the line or poles, the &s;hock would tend to turn the axis of the earth out of its previous direction.

Nitre is found in Bengal naturally cry&s;tallized, and is &s;wept by brooms from earths and &s;tones, and thence called &s;weepings of nitre. It has lately been found in large quantities in a natural ba&s;on of calcareous earth at Molfetta in Italy, both in thin &s;trata between the calcareous beds, and in efflore&s;cences of various beautiful leafy and hairy forms. An account of this nitre-bed is given by Mr. Zimmerman and abridged in Rozier's Journal de Phy&s;ique Fevrier. 1790. This acid appears to be produced in all &s;ituations where animal and vegetable matters are com|pleatly decompo&s;ed, and which are expo&s;ed to the action of the air as on the walls of &s;tables, and &s;laughter-hou&s;es; the cry&s;tals are pri&s;ms furrowed by longitudinal groves.</P>
<P>Dr. Prie&s;tley di&s;covered that nitrous air or gas which he obtained by di&s;&s;olving metals in nitrous acid, would combine rapidly with vital air, and produce with it a true nitrous acid; forming red clouds during the combination; the two airs occupy only the &s;pace before occupied by one of them, and at the &s;ame time heat is given out from the new combination. This dimunition of the bulk of a mixture of nitrous gas and vital air, Dr. Prie&s;tley ingeniou&s;ly u&s;ed as a te&s;t of the purity of the latter; a di&s;covery of the greate&s;t importance in the analy&s;is of airs.</P>
<P>Mr. Cavendi&s;h has &s;ince demon&s;trated that two parts of vital air or oxygene, and one part of phlogi&s;tic air or azote, being long expo&s;ed to electric &s;hocks, unite, and produce nitrous acid. Philos. Trans. Vols. LXXV. and LXXVIII.</P>
<P>Azote is one of the mo&s;t abundant elements in nature, and combined with calorique or heat, it forms azotic gas or phlogi&s;tic air, and compo&s;es two thirds of the atmo&s;phere; and is one of the principal component parts of animal bodies, and when united to vital air or oxygene produces the nitrous acid. Mr. Lavoi&s;ier found that 211/2 parts by weight of azote, and 431/2 parts of oxygene produced 64 parts of nitrous gas, and by the further addition of 36 parts of oxygene nitrous acid was produced Trait&eacute; de Chimie. When two airs become united &s;o as to produce an unela&s;tic liquid much calorique or heat is of nece&s;&s;ity expelled from the new combination, though perhaps nitrous acid and oxygenated marine acid admit more heat into their combinations than other acids.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>III. "HENCE du&s;ky IRON &s;leeps in dark abodes,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Hence du&s;ky Iron.</HI> l. 183. The production of iron from the decompo&s;ition of vege|table bodies is perpetually pre&s;ented to our view; the waters oozing from all mora&s;&s;es are chalybeate, and depo&s;it their ochre on being expo&s;ed to the air, the iron acquiring a calciform &s;tate from its union with oxygene or vital air. Where thin mora&s;&s;es lie on beds of gravel the latter are generally &s;tained by the filtration of &s;ome of the chalybeate water through them. This formation of iron from vegetable recrements is further evinced by the fern leaves and other parts of vegetables, &s;o frequently found in the centre of the knobs or nodules of &s;ome iron-ores.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the&s;e nodules there is a nucleus of whiter iron-earth &s;urrounded by many concentric &s;trata of darker and lighter iron-earth alternately. In one, which now lies before me, the nucleus is a pri&s;m of a triangular form with blunted angles, and about half an inch high, and an inch and half broad; on every &s;ide of this are concentric &s;trata of &s;imilar iron-earth alternately browner and le&s;s brown; each &s;tratum is about a tenth of an inch in thickne&s;s and there are ten of them in number. To what known cau&s;e can this exactly regular di&s;tribution of &s;o many earthy &s;trata of different colours &s;urrounding the nucleus be a&s;cribed? I dont know that any mineralogi&s;ts have attempted an explanation of this wonderful phenomenon. I &s;u&s;pect it is owing to the polarity of the central nucleus. If iron-filings be regularly laid on paper by means of a &s;mall &s;ieve, and a magnet be placed underneath, the filings will di&s;po&s;e them&s;elves in concentric curves with vacant intervals between them. Now if the&s;e iron-filings are conceived to be &s;u&s;pended in a fluid, who&s;e &s;pecific gravity is &s;imilar to their own, and a magnetic bar was introduced as an axis into this fluid, it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that the iron filings would di&s;po&s;e them&s;elves into concentric &s;pheres, with intervals of the circumnatant fluid between them, exactly as is &s;een, in the&s;e nodules of iron-earth. As all the lavas con&s;i&s;t of one fourth of iron, (Kirvan's Mineral) and almo&s;t all other known bodies, whether of animal or vegetable origin, po&s;&s;e&s;s more or le&s;s of this property, may not the di&s;tribu|tion of a great portion of the globe of the earth into &s;trata of greater or le&s;s regularity be owing to the polarity of the whole?</P></NOTE></L>

The circum&s;tances which render iron more valuable to mankind than any other metal are, 1. its property of being rendered hard to &s;o great a degree and thus con&s;tituting &s;uch excellent tools. It was the di&s;covery of this property of iron, Mr. Locke thinks, that gave &s;uch pre-eminence to the European world over the American one. 2. Its power of being welded; that is, when two pieces are made very hot and applied together by hammering, they unite compleatly, unle&s;s any &s;cale of iron in|tervenes; and to prevent this it is u&s;ual for &s;miths to dip the very hot bar in &s;and, a little of which fu&s;es into fluid gla&s;s with the &s;cale and is &s;queezed out from between the uniting parts by the force of hammering. 3. Its power of acquiring magneti&s;m.</P>
<P>It is however to be wi&s;hed that gold or &s;ilver were di&s;covered in as great quantity as iron, &s;ince the&s;e metals being inde&s;tructible by expo&s;ure to air, water, fire or any com|mon acids would &s;upply whole&s;ome ve&s;&s;els for cookery, &s;o much to be de&s;ired, and &s;o difficult to obtain, and would form the mo&s;t light and durable coverings for hou&s;es, as well as inde&s;tructible fire-grates, ovens, and boiling ve&s;&s;els.

<L>"La&s;t MICHELL's hands with touch of potent charm<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>La&s;t Michell's hands.</HI> 1. 193. The di&s;covery of the magnet &s;eems to have been in very early times; it is mentioned by Plato, Lucretius, Pliny, and Galen, and is &s;aid to have taken its name of magnes from Magne&s;ia, a &s;ea-port of antient Lybia.</P>
<P>As every piece of iron which was made magnetical by the touch of a magnet became it&s;elf a magnet, many attempts were made to improve the&s;e artificial magnets, but with|out much &s;ucce&s;s till Servingdon Savary, E&s;q. made them of <HI>hardened</HI> &s;teel bars, which were &s;o powerful that one of them weighing three pounds averdupois would lift another of the &s;ame weight. Philos. Trans.</P>
<P>After this Dr. Knight made very &s;ucce&s;&s;ful experiments on this &s;ubject, which, though he kept his method &s;ecret, &s;eems to have excited others to turn their attention to magneti&s;m. At this time the Rev. Mr. Michell invented an equally efficacious and more expeditious way of making &s;trong artificial magnets, which he publi&s;hed in the end of the year 1750, in which he explained his method of what he called <Q>the double touch,</Q> and which, &s;ince Mr. Knight's method has been known, appears to be &s;omewhat dif|ferent from it.</P>
<P>This method of rendering bars of hardened &s;teel magnetical con&s;i&s;ts in holding verti|cally two or more magnetic bars nearly parallel to each other with their oppo&s;ite poles very near each other, (but neverthele&s;s &s;eparated to a &s;mall di&s;tance,) the&s;e are to be &s;lided over a line of bars laid horizontally a few times backward and forward. See Michell on Magneti&s;m, al&s;o a detailed account in Chamber's Dictionary.</P>
<P>What Mr. Michell propo&s;ed by this method was to include a very &s;mall portion of the horizontal bars, intended to be made magnetical, between the joint forces of two or more bars already magnetical, and by &s;liding them from end to end every part of the line of bars became &s;ucce&s;&s;ively included, and thus bars po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very &s;mall degree of magneti&s;m to begin with, would in a few times &s;liding backwards and forwards make the other ones much more magnetical than them&s;elves, which are then to be taken up and u&s;ed to touch the former, which are in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to be laid down horizontally in a line.</P>
<P>There is &s;till a great field remains for future di&s;coveries in magneti&s;m both in re&s;pect to experiment and theory; the latter con&s;i&s;ts of vague conjectures the more probable of which are perhaps tho&s;e of Elpinus, as they a&s;&s;imulate it to electricity. One conjecture I &s;hall add, viz. that the polarity of magneti&s;m may be owing to the earth's rotatory motion. If heat, electricity, and magneti&s;m are &s;uppo&s;ed to be fluids of different gravities, heat being the heavie&s;t of them, electricity the next heavy, and mag|neti&s;m the lighte&s;t, it is evident that by the quick revolution of the earth the heat will be accumulated mo&s;t over the line, electricity next beneath this, and that the magneti&s;m will be detruded to the poles and axis of the earth, like the atmo&s;pheres of common air and of inflammable gas, as explained in the note on Canto I. l. 123.</P>
<P>Electricity and heat will both of them di&s;place magneti&s;m, and this &s;hews that they may gravitate on each other; and hence when too great a quantity of the electric fluid becomes accumulated at the poles by de&s;cending &s;nows, or other unknown cau&s;es, it may have a tendency to ri&s;e towards the tropics by its centrifugal force, and produce the northern lights.

In&s;omuch that all the light is reflected which falls on any of its interior &s;urfaces at a greater angle of incidence than 24 &frac12; degrees; whereas an artificial gem of gla&s;s does not reflect any light from its hinder &s;urface, unle&s;s that &s;urface is inclined in an angle of 41 degrees. Hence the diamond reflects half as much more light as a factitious gem in &s;imilar circum|&s;tances; to which mu&s;t be added its great tran&s;parency, and the excellent poli&s;h it is capable of. The diamond had neverthele&s;s been placed at the head of cry&s;tals or precious &s;tones by the mineralogi&s;ts, till Bergman ranged it of late in the combu&s;tible cla&s;s of bodies, becau&s;e by the focus of Villette's burning mirror it was evaporated by a heat not much greater than will melt &s;ilver, and gave out light.

The purer air or ether in the antient mythology was repre|&s;ented by Jupiter, and the inferior air by Juno; and the conjunction of the&s;e deities was &s;aid to produce the vernal &s;howers, and procreate all things, as is further &s;poken of in Canto III. 1. 204. It is now di&s;covered that pure air, or oxygene, uniting with variety of ba&s;es forms the various kinds of acids; as the vitriolic acid from pure air and &s;ulphur; the nitrous acid from pure air and phlogi&s;tic air, or azote; and carbonic acid, (or fixed air,) from pure air and charcoal. Some of the&s;e affinities were perhaps portrayed by the Magi of Egypt, who were probably learned in chemi&s;try, in their hieroglyphic pictures before the invention of letters, by the loves of Jupiter with terre&s;trial ladies.

The granite rocks and the lime&s;tone rocks have been cracked to very great depths at the time they were rai&s;ed up by &s;ubterranean fires; in the&s;e cracks are found mo&s;t of the metallic ores, except iron and perhaps mangane&s;e, the former of which is generally found in horizontal &s;trata, and the latter generally near the &s;urface of the earth.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;o convenient a te&s;t for the di&s;covery of iron by the magnet, have long &s;ince found it in all vegetable and animal matters; and of late Mr. Scheele has di&s;covered the exi&s;tence of mangane&s;e in vegetable a&s;hes. Scheele, 56 mem. Stock. 1774. Kirwan. Min. 353. Which accounts for the production of it near the &s;urface of earth, and thence for its calciform appearance, or union with vital air. Bergman has likewi&s;e &s;hewn, that the lime&s;tones which become blui&s;h or dark coloured when calcined, po&s;&s;e&s;s a mixture of mangane&s;e, and are thence preferable as a cement to other kinds of lime. 2. Bergman, 229. Which impregnation with mangane&s;e has probably been re|ceived from the decompo&s;ition of &s;uperincumbent vegetable matters.</P>
<P>The&s;e cracks or perpendicular caverns in the granite or lime&s;tone pa&s;s to unknown depths; and it is up the&s;e channels that I have endeavoured to &s;hew that the &s;team ri&s;es which becomes afterwards conden&s;ed and produces the warm &s;prings of this i&s;land, and other parts of the world. (See note on Fucus, Vol. II.) And up the&s;e cracks I &s;uppo&s;e certain vapours ari&s;e, which either alone, or by meeting with &s;omething de&s;cending into them from above, have produced mo&s;t of the metals; and &s;everal of the materials in which they are bedded. Thus the ponderous earth, Barytes, of Derby&s;bire, is found in the&s;e cracks, and is &s;tratified frequently with lead-ore, and frequently &s;urrounds it. This ponderous earth has been found by Dr. Hoepfner in a granite in Switzerland, and may have thus been &s;ublimed from immen&s;e depths by great heat, and have obtained its car|bonic or vitriolic acid from above. Annales de Chimie. There is al&s;o rea&s;on to con|clude that &s;omething from above is nece&s;&s;ary to the formation of many of the metals: at Hawk&s;tone in Shrop&s;hire, the &s;eat of Sir Richard Hill, there is an elevated rock of &s;iliceous &s;and which is coloured green with copper in many places high in the air; and I have in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a &s;pecimen of lead formed in the cavity of an iron nodule, and another of lead amid &s;par from a crack of a coal-&s;tratum; all which countenance the modern pro|duction of tho&s;e metals from de&s;cending materials. To which &s;hould be added, that the highe&s;t mountains of granite, which have therefore probably never been covered with marine productions on account of their early elevation, nor with vegetable or animal matters on account of their great coldne&s;s, contain no metallic ores, whil&s;t the lower ones contain copper and tin in their cracks or veins, both in Saxony, Sile&s;ia, and Cornwall.

<P>The tran&s;mutation of one metal into another, though hitherto undi&s;covered by the alchymi&s;ts, does not appear impo&s;&s;ible; &s;uch tran&s;mutations have been &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t in nature, thus lapis calaminaris may have been produced from the de&s;truction of lead-ore, as it is generally found on the top of the veins of lead, where it has been calcined or united with air, and becau&s;e ma&s;&s;es of lead-ore are often found intirely inclo&s;ed in it. So &s;ilver is found mixed in almo&s;t all lead-ores, and &s;ometimes in &s;eperate filaments within the cavities of lead-ore, as I am informed by Mr. Michell, and is thence probably a partial tran&s;mutation of the lead to &s;ilver, the rapid progre&s;s of modern chemi&s;try having &s;hewn the analogy between metallic calces and acids, may lead to the power of trans|muting their ba&s;es: a di&s;covery much to be wi&s;hed.</P></NOTE></L>

We were here at once &s;urpri&s;ed and terrified by a &s;ight &s;urely one of the mo&s;t magnificent in the world. In that va&s;t expan&s;e of de&s;ert, from W. to N. W. of us, we &s;aw a number of prodigious pillars of &s;and at dif|ferent di&s;tances, at times moving with great celerity, at others &s;talking on with a maje&s;tic &s;lowne&s;s; at intervals we thought they were coming in a very few minutes to overwhelm us; and &s;mall quantities of &s;and did actually more than once reach us. Again they would retreat &s;o as to be almo&s;t out of &s;ight, their tops reaching to the very clouds. There the tops often &s;eparated from the bodies; and the&s;e, once di&s;joined, di&s;per&s;ed in the air, and did not appear more. Sometimes they were broken in the middle, as if &s;truck with large cannon-&s;hot. About noon they began to advance with con&s;iderable &s;wiftne&s;s upon us, the wind being very &s;trong at north. Eleven of them ranged along &s;ide of us about the di&s;tance of three miles. The greate&s;t diameter of the large&s;t appeared to me at that di&s;tance as if it would mea&s;ure ten feet. They retired from us with a wind at S. E. leaving an impre&s;&s;ion upon my mind to which I can give no name, though &s;urely one ingredient in it was fear, with a con&s;iderable deal of wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment. It was in vain to think of flying; the &s;wifte&s;t hor&s;e, or fa&s;te&s;t &s;ailing &s;hip, could be of no u&s;e to carry us out of this danger; and the full per&s;ua&s;ion of this rivetted me as if to the &s;pot where I &s;tood.</P>
<P>The &s;ame appearance of moving pillars of &s;and pre&s;ented them&s;elves to us this day in form and di&s;po&s;ition like tho&s;e we had &s;een at Waadi Halboub, only they &s;eemed to be more in number and le&s;s in &s;ize. They came &s;everal times in a direction clo&s;e upon us, that is, I believe, within le&s;s than two miles. They began immediately after &s;un ri&s;e like a thick wood and almo&s;t darkened the &s;un. His rays &s;hining through them for near an hour, gave them an appearance of pillars of fire. Our people now became de&s;perate, the Greeks &s;hrieked out and &s;aid it was the day of judgment; I&s;mael pronounced it to be hell; and the Turcorories, that the world was on fire.</P><BIBL>Bruce's Travels, Vol. IV. p. 553,&mdash;555.</BIBL></Q>
<P>From this account it would appear, that the eddies of wind were owing to the long range of broken rocks, which bounded one &s;ide of the &s;andy de&s;ert, and bent the currents of air, which &s;truck again&s;t their &s;ides; and were thus like the eddies in a &s;tream of water, which falls again&s;t oblique ob&s;tacles. This explanation is probably the true one, as the&s;e whirl-winds were not attended with rain or lightening like the tornadoes of the We&s;t-Indies.</P></NOTE></L>

It is re|markable that the cypre&s;s groves in the antient greek writers, as in Theocritus, were dedicated to Venus; and afterwards became funereal emblems. Which was probably occa&s;ioned by the Cypre&s;s being an accompaniment of Venus in the annual proce&s;&s;ions, in which &s;he was &s;uppo&s;ed to lament over the funeral of Adonis; a ceremony which obtained over all the ea&s;tern world from great antiquity, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be referred to by Ezekiel, who accu&s;es the idolatrous woman of weeping for Thammus.</P></NOTE></L>

The clouds con&s;i&s;t of conden&s;ed vapour, the particles of which are too &s;mall &s;eparately to overcome the tenacity of the air, and which therefore do not de&s;cend. They are in &s;uch &s;mall &s;pheres as to repel each other, that is, they are applied to each other by &s;uch very &s;mall &s;urfaces, that the attraction of the particles of each drop to its own centre is greater than its attraction to the &s;urface of the drop in its vicinity; every one has ob&s;erved with what difficulty &s;mall &s;pherules of quick&s;ilver can be made to unite, owing to the &s;ame cau&s;e; and it is common to &s;ee on riding through &s;hallow water on a clear day, numbers of very &s;mall &s;pheres of water as they are thrown from the hor&s;es feet run along the &s;urface for many yards before they again unite with it. In many ca&s;es the&s;e &s;pherules of water, which compo&s;e clouds, are kept from uniting by a &s;urplus of electric fluid; and fall in violent &s;howers as &s;oon as that is withdrawn from them, as in thunder &s;torms. See note on Canto l. 1. 554.</P>
<P>If in this &s;tate a cloud becomes frozen, it is torn to pieces in its de&s;cent by the friction of the air, and falls in white flakes of &s;now. Or the&s;e flakes are rounded by being rubbed together by the winds, and by having their angles thawed off by the warmer air beneath as they de&s;cend; and part of the water produced by the&s;e angles thus di&s;&s;olved is ab&s;orbed into the body of the hail&s;tone, as may be &s;een by holding a lump of &s;now over a candle, and there becomes frozen into ice by the quantity of cold which the hail&s;tone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es beneath the freezing point, or which is produced by its quick evaporation in falling; and thus hail&s;tones are often found of greater or le&s;s den&s;ity according as they con&s;i&s;t of a greater portion of &s;now or ice. If hail&s;tones con&s;i&s;ted of the large drops of &s;howers frozen in their de&s;cent, they would con&s;i&s;t of pure tran&s;parent ice.</P>
<P>As hail is only produced in &s;ummer, and is always attended with &s;torms, &s;ome philo|&s;ophers have believed that the &s;udden departure of electriclty from a cloud may effect &s;omething yet unknown in this phenomenon; but it may happen in &s;ummer independent of electricity, becau&s;e the aqueous vapour is then rai&s;ed higher in the atmo&s;phere, whence it has further to fall, and there is warmer air below for it to fall through.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="15"></L>

Where the attraction of the body to the particles of water is greater than the attractions of tho&s;e particles to each other, it becomes &s;pread upon their &s;urface, or &s;lides down them in actual contact; as on the broad parts of the blades of moi&s;t gra&s;s: where the attraction of the &s;urface to the water is le&s;s than the attraction of the particles of water to each other, the dew &s;tands in drops; as on the points and edges of gra&s;s or gor&s;e, where the &s;urface pre&s;ented to the drop being &s;mall it attracts it &s;o little as but ju&s;t to &s;upport it without much changing its globular form: where there is no attraction between the vegetable &s;urface and the dew drops, as on cabbage leaves, the drop does not come into contact with the leaf, but hangs over it repelled, and retains it natural form, com|po&s;ed of the attraction and pre&s;&s;ure of its own parts, and thence looks like quick&s;ilver, reflecting light from both its &s;urfaces. Nor is this owing to any oiline&s;s of the leaf, but &s;imply to the poli&s;h of its &s;urface, as a light needle may be laid on water in the &s;ame manner without touching it; for as the attractive powers of poli&s;hed &s;urfaces are greater when in actual contact, &s;o the repul&s;ive power is greater before contact.</P></NOTE></L>

Mi&s;ts are clouds re&s;ting on the ground, they generally come on at the beginning of night, and either fill the moi&s;t vallies, or hang on the &s;ummits of hills, according to the degree of moi&s;ture previou&s;ly di&s;&s;olved, and the education of heat from them. The air over rivers during the warmth of the day &s;u&s;pends much moi&s;ture, and as the changeful &s;urface of rivers occa&s;ions them to cool &s;ooner than the land at the approach of evening, mi&s;ts are mo&s;t frequently &s;een to begin over rivers, and to &s;pread them&s;elves over moi&s;t grounds, and fill the vallies, while the mi&s;ts on the tops of mountains are more properly clouds, conden&s;ed by the coldne&s;s of their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>On a&s;cending up the &s;ide of a hill from a mi&s;ty valley, I have ob&s;erved a beautiful coloured halo round the moon when a certain thickne&s;s of mi&s;t was over me, which cea&s;ed to be vi&s;ible as &s;oon as I emerged out of it; and well remember admiring with other &s;pectators the &s;hadow of the three &s;pires of the cathedral church at Lichfield, the moon ri&s;ing behind it, apparently broken off, and lying di&s;tinctly over our heads as if horizontally on the &s;urface of the mi&s;t, which aro&s;e about as high as the roof of the church. There are &s;ome curious remarks on &s;hadows or reflections &s;een on the &s;urface of mi&s;ts from high mountains in Ulloa's Voyages. The dry mi&s;t of &s;ummer 1783, was probably occa&s;ioned by volcanic eruption, as mentioned in note on Chunda, Vol. II. and therefore more like the atmo&s;phere of &s;moke which hangs on &s;till days over great cities.</P>
<P>There is a dry mi&s;t, or rather a dimini&s;hed tran&s;parence of the air, which according to Mr. Sau&s;&s;ure accompanies fair weather, while great tran&s;parence of air indicates rain. Thus when large rivers two miles broad, &s;uch as at Liverpool, appear narrow, it is &s;aid to progno&s;ticate rain; and when wide, fair weather. This want of tran&s;parence of the air in dry weather, may be owing to new combinations or decompo&s;itions of the vapours di&s;&s;olved in it, but wants further inve&s;tigation.

The phenomena of the tides have been well inve&s;tigated and &s;ati&s;factorily explained by Sir I&s;aac Newton and Dr. Halley from the reciprocal gravitations of the earth, moon, and &s;un. As the earth and moon move round a centre of motion near the earth's &s;urface, at the &s;ame time that they are proceeding in their annual orbit round the &s;un, it follows that the water on the &s;ide of the earth neare&s;t this centre of motion between the earth and moon will be more attracted by the moon, and the waters on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the earth will be le&s;s attracted by the moon, than the central parts of the earth. Add to this that the centrifugal force of the water on the &s;ide of the earth furthe&s;t from the centre of the motion, round which the earth and moon move, (which, as was &s;aid before, is near the &s;urface of the earth) is greater than that on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the earth, From both the&s;e cau&s;es it is ea&s;y to comprehend that the water will ri&s;e on two &s;ides of the earth, viz. on that neare&s;t to the moon, and its oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and that it will be flattened in con&s;equence at the quadratures, and thus produce two tides in every lunar day, which con&s;i&s;ts of about twenty-four hours and forty-eight minutes.</P>
<P>The&s;e tides will be al&s;o affected by the &s;olar attraction when it coincides with the lunar one, or oppo&s;es it, as at new and full moon, and will al&s;o be much influenced by the oppo&s;ing &s;hores in every part of the earth.</P>
<P>Now as the moon in moving round the centre of gravity between it&s;elf and the earth de&s;cribes a much larger orbit than the earth de&s;cribes round the &s;ame centre, it follows that the centrifugal motion on the &s;ide of the moon oppo&s;ite to the earth mu&s;t be much greater than the centrifugal motion of the &s;ide of the earth oppo&s;ite to the moon round the &s;ame centre, And &s;econdly, as the attraction of the earth exerted on the moon's &s;urface next to the earth is much greater than the attraction of the moon exerted on the earth's &s;urface, the tides on the lunar &s;ea, (if &s;uch there be,) &s;hould be much greater than tho&s;e of our ocean. Add to this that as the &s;ame face of the moon always is turned to the earth, the lunar tides mu&s;t be permanent, and if the &s;olid parts of the moon be &s;pherical, mu&s;t always cover the pha&s;is next to us. But as there are evidently hills and vales and volcanos on this &s;ide of the moon, the con&s;equence is that the moon has no ocean, or that it is frozen.</P></NOTE></L>

The &s;piral form of many &s;hells &s;eem to have afforded a more frugal manner of covering the long tail of the fi&s;h with calcareous armour; &s;ince a &s;ingle thin partition between the adjoining circles of the fi&s;h was &s;ufficient to defend both &s;ur|faces, and thus much cretaceous matter is &s;aved; and it is probable that from this &s;piral form they are better enabled to feel the vibrations of the element in which they exi&s;t. See note on Canto IV. l. 162. This cretaceous matter is formed by a mucous &s;ecretion from the &s;kin of the fi&s;h, as is &s;een in crab-fi&s;h, and others which annually ca&s;t their &s;hells, and is at fir&s;t a &s;oft mucous covering, (like that of a hen's egg, when it is laid a day or two too &s;oon,) and which gradually hardens. This may al&s;o be &s;een in common &s;hell &s;nails, if a part of their &s;hell be broken it becomes repaired in a &s;imilar manner with mucus, which by degrees hardens into &s;hell.</P>
<P>It it probable the calculi or &s;tones found in other animals may have a &s;imilar origin, as they are formed on mucous membranes, as tho&s;e of the kidney and bladder, chalk-&s;tones in the gout, and gall-&s;tones; and are probably owing to the inflammation of the membrane where they are produced, and vary according to the degree of inflammation of the membrane which forms them, and the kind of mucous which it naturally produces. Thus the &s;helly matter of different &s;hell-fi&s;h differs, from the cour&s;er kinds which form the &s;hells of crabs, to the finer kinds which produces the mother-pearl.</P>
<P>The beautiful colours of &s;ome &s;hells originate from the thinne&s;s of the laminae of which they con&s;i&s;t, rather than to any colouring matter, as is &s;een in mother-pearl, which reflects different colours according to the obliquity of the light which falls on it. The beautiful pri&s;matic colours &s;een on the Labrodore &s;tone are owing to a &s;imilar cau&s;e, viz. the thinne&s;s of the laminae of which it con&s;i&s;ts, and has probably been formed from mother-pearl &s;hells.</P>
<P>It is curious that &s;ome of the mo&s;t common fo&s;&s;il &s;hells are not now known in their recent &s;tate, as the cornua ammonis; and on the contrary, many &s;hells which are very plentiful in their recent &s;tate, as limpets, &s;ea-ears, volutes, cowries, are very rarely found fo&s;&s;il.

Water in de&s;cending down elevated &s;ituations if the outlet for it below is not &s;ufficient for its emi&s;&s;ion acts with a force equal to the height of the column, as is &s;een in an experimental machine called the philo&s;ophical bellows, in which a few pints of water are made to rai&s;e many hundred pounds. To this cau&s;e is to be a&s;cribed many large promontories of ice being occa&s;ionally thrown down from the glaciers; rocks have likewi&s;e been thrown from the &s;ides of mountains by the &s;ame cau&s;e, and large portions of earth have been removed many hundred yards from their &s;ituations at the foot of mountains. On in&s;pecting the locomotion of about thirty acres of earth with a &s;mall hou&s;e near Bilder's Bridge in Shrop&s;hire, about twenty years ago, from the foot of a mountain towards the river, I well remember it bore all the marks of having been thus lifted up, pu&s;hed away, and as it were crumpled into ridges, by a column of water contained in the mountain.</P>
<P>From water being thus confined in high columns between the &s;trata of mountainous countries it has often happened that when wells or perforations have been made into the earth, that &s;prings have ari&s;en much above the &s;urface of the new well. When the new bridge was building at Dublin Mr. G. Semple found a &s;pring in the bed of the river where he meant to lay the foundation of a pierre, which, by fixing iron pipes into it, he rai&s;ed many feet. Treati&s;e on Building in Water, by G. Semple. From having ob&s;erved a valley north-we&s;t of St. Alkmond's well near Derby, at the head of which that &s;pring of water once probably exi&s;ted, and by its current formed the valley, (but which in after times found its way out in its pre&s;ent &s;ituation,) I &s;u&s;pect that St. Alkmond's well might by building round it be rai&s;ed high enough to &s;upply many &s;treets in Derby with &s;pring-water which are now only &s;upplied with river-water.

When from any peculiar &s;ituations of land in re&s;pect to &s;ea the tropic becomes more heated, when the &s;un is vertical over it, than the line, the periodical winds called mon&s;oons are produced, and the&s;e are attended by rainy &s;ea&s;ons; for as the air at the tropic is now more heated than at the line it a&s;cends by decrea&s;e of its &s;pecific gravity, and floods of air ru&s;h in both from the South We&s;t and North Ea&s;t, and the&s;e being one warmer than the other the rain is precipitated by their mixture as ob&s;erved by Dr. Hutton. See additional notes, No. XXV. All late travellers have as|cribed the ri&s;e of the Nile to the mon&s;oons which deluge Nubia and Aby&s;&s;inia with rain. The whirling of the a&s;cending air was even &s;een by Mr. Bruce in Aby&s;&s;inia; he &s;ays, <Q>every morning a &s;mall cloud began to whirl round, and pre&s;ently after the whole heavens became covered with clouds,</Q> by this vortex of a&s;cending air the N. E. winds and the S. W. winds, which flow in to &s;upply the place of the a&s;cending column, became mixed more rapidly and depo&s;ited their rain in greater abundance.</P>
<P>Mr. Volney ob&s;erves that the time of the ri&s;ing of the Nile commences about the 19th of June, and that Aby&s;&s;inia and the adjacent parts of Africa are deluged with rain in May, June, and July, and produce a ma&s;s of water which is three months in draining off. The Abbe Le Pluche ob&s;erves that as Sirius, or the dog-&s;tar, ro&s;e at the time of the commencement of the flood its ri&s;ing was watched by the a&s;tronomers, and notice given of the approach of inundation by hanging the figure of Anubis, which was that of a man with a dog's head, upon all their temples.

Thus Lower Egypt is a flat country warmed by the &s;un more than the higher lands of one &s;ide of it, and than the Mediterranean on the other; and hence the winds which blow over it acquire greater warmth, which ever way they come, than they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before, and in con&s;equence have a tendency to acquire and not to part with their vapour like the north-ea&s;t winds of this country.

The bath at Buxton being of 82 degrees of heat is called a warm bath, and is &s;o compared with common &s;pring-water which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es but 48 degrees of heat, but is neverthele&s;s a cold bath compared to the heat of the body which is 98. On going into this bath there is therefore always a chill perceived at the fir&s;t immer&s;ion, but after having been in it a minute the chill cea&s;es and a &s;en&s;ation of warmth &s;ucceeds though the body continues to be immer&s;ed in the water. The cau&s;e of this curious phenomenon is to be looked for in the laws of animal &s;en&s;ation and not from any properties of heat. When a per&s;on goes from clear day-light into an ob&s;cure room for a while it appears gloomy, which gloom however in a little time cea&s;es, and the de|ficiency of light becomes no longer perceived. This is not &s;olely owing to the enlarge|ment of the iris of the eye, &s;ince that is performed in an in&s;tant, but to this law of &s;en|&s;ation, that when a le&s;s &s;timulus is applied (within certain bounds) the &s;en&s;ibility increa&s;es. Thus at going into a bath as much colder than the body as that of Buxton, the diminu|tion of heat on the &s;kin is at fir&s;t perceived, but in about a minute the &s;en&s;ibility to heat increa&s;es and the nerves of the &s;kin are equally excited by the le&s;&s;ened &s;timulus. The &s;en&s;ation of warmth at emerging from a cold-bath, and the pain called the hot-ach, after the hands have been immer&s;ed in &s;now, depend on the &s;ame principle, viz. the increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;kin after having been previou&s;ly expo&s;ed to a &s;timulus le&s;s than u&s;ual.</P></NOTE></L>

Mr. Lavoi&s;ier and others of the French &s;chool have mo&s;t ingeniou&s;ly endeavoured to &s;hew that water con&s;i&s;ts of pure air, called by them oxygene, and of inflammable air, called hydrogene, with as much of the matter of heat, or calorique, as is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve them in the form of gas. Gas is di&s;tingui&s;hed from &s;team by its pre&s;erving its ela&s;ticity under the pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere, and in the greate&s;t degrees of cold yet known. The hi&s;tory of the progre&s;s of this great di&s;covery is detailed in the Memoires of the Royal Academy for 1781, and the experimental proofs of it are delivered in Lavoi&s;ier's Elements of Chemi&s;try.

<L>From each chill leaf the &s;ilvery drops repel,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>From each chill leaf.</HI> l. 439. The upper &s;ide of the leaf is the organ of vegetable re&s;piration, as explained in the additional notes, No XXXVII, hence the leaf is liable to injury from much moi&s;ture on this &s;urface, and is de&s;troyed by being &s;meared with oil, in the&s;e re&s;pects re&s;embling the lungs of animals or the &s;piracula of in&s;ects. To prevent the&s;e injuries &s;ome leaves repel the dew-drops from their upper &s;urfaces as tho&s;e of cabbages; other vegetables clo&s;e the upper furfaces of their leaves together in the night or in wet weather, as the &s;en&s;itive plant; others only hang their leaves downwards &s;o as to &s;hoot the wet from them, as kidney-beans, and many trees. See note on. 1. 18 of this Canto.</P></NOTE></L>
<L>And clo&s;e the timorous floret's golden bell.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Golden bell.</HI> l. 440. There are mu&s;cles placed about the foot&s;talks of the leaves or leaflets of many plants, for the purpo&s;e of clo&s;ing their upper &s;urfaces together, or of bending them down &s;o as to &s;hoot off the &s;howers or dew-drops, as mentioned in the preceeding note. The claws of the petals or of the divi&s;ions of the calyx of many flowers are furni&s;hed in a &s;imilar manner with mu&s;cles, which are exerted to open or clo&s;e the corol and calyx of the flower as in tragopogon, anemone. This action of opening and clo&s;ing the leaves or flowers does not appear to be produced &s;imply by <HI>irritation</HI> on the mu&s;cles them&s;elves, but by the connection of tho&s;e mu&s;cles with a <HI>&s;en&s;itive</HI> &s;en&s;orium or brain exi&s;ting in each individual bud or flower. 1&s;t. Becau&s;e many flowers clo&s;e from the defect of &s;timulus, not by the exce&s;s of it, as by darkne&s;s, which is the ab&s;ence of the &s;timulus of light; or by cold, which is the ab&s;ence of the &s;timulus of heat. Now the defect of heat, or the ab&s;ence of food, or of drink, affects our <HI>&s;en&s;ations,</HI> which had been previou&s;ly accu&s;tomed to a greater quantity of them; but a mu&s;cle cannot be &s;aid to be &s;timulated into action by a defect of &s;timulus. 2. Becau&s;e the mu&s;cles around the foot&s;talks of the &s;ubdivi&s;ions of the leaves of the &s;en&s;itive plant are exerted when any injury is offered to the other extremity of the leaf, and &s;ome of the &s;tamens of the flowers of the cla&s;s Syngene&s;ia contract them&s;elves when others are irritated. See note on Chondrilla, Vol. II. of this work.</P>
<P>From this circum&s;tance the contraction of the mu&s;cles of vegetables &s;eems to depend on a di&s;agreeable <HI>&s;en&s;ation</HI> in &s;ome di&s;tant part, and not on the <HI>irritation</HI> of the mu&s;cles them&s;elves. Thus when a particle of du&s;t &s;timulates the ball of the eye, the eye-lids are in&s;tantly clo&s;ed, and when too much light pains the retina, the mu&s;cles of the iris contract its aperture, and this not by any connection or con&s;ent of the nerves of tho&s;e parts, but as an effort to prevent or to remove a di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, which evinces that vegetables are endued with &s;en&s;ation, or that each bud has a common &s;en&s;orium, and is furni&s;hed with a brain or a central place where its nerves were connected.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="440"></L>

The practice of flooding lands long in u&s;e in China has been but lately introduced into this country. Be&s;ides the &s;upplying water to the herbage in dryer &s;ea&s;ons, it &s;eems to defend it from fro&s;t in the early part of the year, and thus doubly advances the vegetation. The waters which ri&s;e from &s;prings pa&s;&s;ing through marl or lime&s;tone are replete with calcareous earth, and when thrown over mora&s;&s;es they depo&s;it this earth and incru&s;t or con&s;olidate the mora&s;s.

<P>The water of many &s;prings contains much azotic gas, or phlogi&s;tic air, be&s;ides car|bonic gas, or fixed air, as that of Buxton and Bath; this being &s;et at liberty may more readily contribute to the production of nitre by means of the putre&s;cent matters which it is expo&s;ed to by being &s;pread upon the &s;urface of the land; in the &s;ame manner as frequently turning over heaps of manure facilitates the nitrous proce&s;s by impri&s;oning atmo&s;pheric air in the inter&s;tices of the putre&s;cent materials. Water ari&s;ing by land|floods brings along with it much of the mo&s;t &s;oluble parts of the manure from the higher lands to the lower ones. River-water in its clear &s;tate and tho&s;e &s;prings which are called &s;oft are le&s;s beneficial for the purpo&s;e of watering lands, as they contain le&s;s earthy or &s;aline matter; and water from di&s;&s;olving &s;now from its &s;low &s;olution brings but little earth along with it, as may be &s;een by the comparative clearne&s;s of the water of &s;now-floods.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="520"></L>

The common air of the atmo&s;phere appears by the analy&s;is of Dr. Prie&s;tley and other philo&s;ophers to con&s;i&s;t of about three parts of an ela&s;tic fluid unfit for re&s;piration or combu&s;tion, called azote by the French &s;chool, and about one fourth of pure vital air fit for the &s;upport of animal life and of combu&s;tion, called oxygene. The principal &s;ource of the azote is probably from the decompo&s;ition of all vegetable and animal matters by putrefaction and combu&s;tion; the principal &s;ource of vital air or oxygene is perhaps from the decompo&s;ition of water in the organs of vegetables by means of the &s;un's light. The difficulty of injecting vegetable ve&s;&s;els &s;eems to &s;hew that their per&s;pirative pores are much le&s;s than tho&s;e of animals, and that the water which con&s;titutes their per&s;piration is &s;o divided at the time of its exclu&s;ion that by means of the &s;un's light it becomes decompo&s;ed, the inflammable air or hydrogene, which is one of its con&s;tituent parts, being retained to form the oil, re&s;in, wax, honey, &amp;c. of the vegetable economy; and the other part, which united with light or heat becomes vital air or oxygene gas, ri&s;es into the atmo&s;phere and repleni&s;hes it with the food of life.</P>
<P>Dr. Prie&s;tley has evinced by very ingenious experiments that the blood gives out phlogi&s;ton, and receives vital air, or oxygene-gas by the lungs.

I &s;aw from the S. E. a haze come in colour like the purple part of a rainbow, but not &s;o compre&s;&s;ed or thick; it did not occupy twenty yards in breadth, and was about twelve feet high from the ground. It was a kind of a blu&s;h upon the air, and it moved very rapidly, for I &s;carce could turn to fall upon the ground with my head to the northward, when I felt the heat of its current plainly upon my face. We all lay flat upon the ground, as if dead, till Idris told us it was blown over. The meteor, or purple haze, which I &s;aw was indeed pa&s;&s;ed; but the light air that &s;till blew was of heat to threaten &s;uffocation. For my part I found di&s;tinctly in my brea&s;t, that I had imbibed a part of it; nor was I free of an a&s;thmatic &s;en&s;ation till I had been &s;ome months in Italy.</Q> <BIBL>Bruce's Travels.

<P>It is difficult to account for the narrow track of this pe&s;tilential wind, which is &s;aid not to exceed twenty yards, and for its &s;mall elevation of twelve feet. A whirlwind will pa&s;s forwards, and throw down an avenue of trees by its quick revolution as it pa&s;&s;es, but nothing like a whirling is de&s;cribed as happening in the&s;e narrow &s;treams of air, and whirlwinds a&s;cend to greater heights. There &s;eems but one known manner in which this channel of air could be effected, and that is by electricity.</P>
<P>The volcanic origin of the&s;e winds is mentioned in the note on Chunda in Vol. II. of this work; it mu&s;t here be added, that Profe&s;&s;or Vairo at Naples found, that during the eruption of Ve&s;uvius perpendicular iron bars were electric; and others have ob&s;erved &s;uffocating damps to attend the&s;e eruptions. Ferber's Travels in Italy, p. 133. And la&s;tly, that a current of air attends the pa&s;&s;age of electric matter, as is &s;een in pre&s;enting an electrized point to the flame of a candle. In Mr. Bruce's account of this &s;imoom, it was in its cour&s;e over a quite dry de&s;ert of &s;and, (and which was in con&s;equence unable to conduct an electric &s;tream into the earth beneath it,) to &s;ome moi&s;t rocks at but a few miles di&s;tance; and thence would appear to be a &s;tream of electricity from a volcano attended with noxious air; and as the bodies of Mr. Bruce and his attendants were in&s;ulated on the &s;and, they would not be &s;en&s;ible of their increa&s;ed electricity, as it pa&s;&s;ed over them; to which it may be added, that a &s;ulphurous or &s;uffocating &s;en&s;ation is &s;aid to accompany fla&s;hes of lightning, and even &s;trong &s;parks of artificial electricity. In the above account of the &s;imoom, a great redne&s;s in the air is &s;aid to be a certain &s;ign of its approach, which may be occa&s;ioned by the eruption of flame from a di&s;tant volcano in the&s;e exten&s;ive and impenetrable de&s;erts of &s;and.

<L>And crown'd with fame your TORRICELL, and BOYLE;<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Torricell and Boyle.</HI> l. 128. The pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere was di&s;covered by Torricelli, a di&s;ciple of Galileo, who had previou&s;ly found that the air had weight. Dr. Hook and M. Du Hamel a&s;cribe the invention of the air-pump to Mr Boyle, who however confe&s;&s;es he had &s;ome hints concerning its con&s;truction from De Guerick. The vacancy at the &s;ummit of the barometer is termed the Torricellian vacuum, and the exhau&s;ted receiver of an air pump the Boylean vacuum, in honour of the&s;e two philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>The mi&s;t and de&s;cending dew which appear at fir&s;t exhau&s;ting the receiver of an air-pump, are explained in the Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXVIII. from the cold produced by the expan&s;ion of air. For a thermometer placed in the receiver &s;inks &s;ome degrees, and in a very little time, as &s;oon as a &s;ufficient quantity of heat can be acquired from the &s;urrounding bodies, the dew becomes again taken up. See additional notes, No. VII. Mr. Sau&s;&s;ure ob&s;erved on placing his hygrometer in a receiver of an air-pump, that though on beginning to exhau&s;t it the air became mi&s;ty, and parted with its moi&s;ture, yet the hair of his hygrometer contracted, and the in&s;trument pointed to greater dryne&s;s. This unexpected occurrence is explained by M. Monge (Annales de Chymie, Tom. V.) to depend on the want of the u&s;ual pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere to force the aqueous particles into the pores of the hair; and M. Sau&s;&s;ure &s;uppo&s;es, that his ve&s;icular vapour requires more time to be redi&s;&s;olved, than is nece&s;&s;ary to dry the hair of his thermometer. E&s;&s;ais &s;ur l'Hygrom. p. 226. but I &s;u&s;pect there is a le&s;s hypothetical way of under&s;tanding it; when a colder body is brought into warm and moi&s;t air, (as a bottle of &s;pring-water for in&s;tance,) a &s;team is quickly collected on its &s;urface; the contrary occurs when a warmer body is brought into cold and damp air, it continues free from dew &s;o long as it continues warm; for it warms the atmo&s;phere around it, and renders it capable of receiving in&s;tead of parting with moi&s;ture. The moment the air becomes rarefied in the receiver of the air-pump it becomes colder, as appears by the thermometer, and depo&s;its its vapour; but the hair of Mr. Sau&s;&s;ure's hygrometer is now warmer than the air in which it is immer&s;ed, and in con&s;equence becomes dryer than before, by warming the air which immediately &s;urrounds it, a part of its moi&s;ture evaporating along with its heat.</P></NOTE></L>

The &s;ame of Dr. Prie&s;tley is known in every part of the earth where &s;cience has penetrated. His various di&s;coveries re&s;pecting the analy&s;is of the atmo&s;phere, and the production of variety of new airs or ga&s;&s;es, can only be clearly under&s;tood by reading his Experiments on Airs, (3 vols. octavo, John&s;on, London.) the following are among&s;t his many di&s;coveries. 1. The di&s;covery of nitrous and dephlogi&s;ticated airs. 2. The exhibition of the acids and alkalies in the form of air. 3. A&s;certaining the purity of re&s;pirable air by nitrous air. 4. The re&s;toration of vitiated air by vegetation. 5. The influence of light to enable vegetables to yield pure air. 6. The conver&s;ion by means of light of animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, that would otherwi&s;e become putrid and offen&s;ive, into nouri&s;hment of vegetables. 7. The u&s;e of re&s;piration by the blood parting with phlogi&s;ton, and imbibing dephlo|gi&s;ticated air.</P>
<P>The experiments here alluded to are, 1. Concerning the production of nitrous gas from di&s;&s;olving iron and many other metals in nitrous acid, which though fir&s;t di&s;covered by Dr. Hales (Static. E&s;&s;. Vol. I. p. 224) was fully inve&s;tigated, and applied to the important purpo&s;e of di&s;tingui&s;hing the purity of atmo&s;pheric air by Dr. Prie&s;tley. When about two mea&s;ures of common air and one of nitrous gas are mixed together a red efferve&s;cence takes place, and the two airs occupy about one fourth le&s;s &s;pace than was previou&s;ly occupied by the common air alone.</P>
<P>2. Concerning the green &s;ub&s;tance which grows at the bottom of re&s;ervoirs of water, which Dr. Prie&s;tley di&s;covered to yield much pure air when the &s;un &s;hone on it. His method of collecting this air is by placing over the green &s;ub&s;tance, which he believes to be a vegetable of the genus conferva, an inverted bell-gla&s;s previou&s;ly filled with water, which &s;ub&s;ides as the air ari&s;es; it has &s;ince been found that all vegetables give up pure air from their leaves, when the &s;un &s;hines upon them, but not in the night, which may be owing to the &s;leep of the plant.</P>
<P>3. The third refers to the great quantity of pure air contained in the calces of metals. The calces were long known to weigh much more than the metallic bodies before calcination, in&s;omuch that 100 pounds of lead will produce 112 pounds of minium; the ore of mangane&s;e, which is always found near the &s;urface of the earth, is replete with pure air, which is now u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of bleaching. Other metals when expo&s;ed to the atmo&s;phere attract the pure air from it, and become calces by its combination, as zinc, lead, iron; and increa&s;e in weight in proportion to the air, which they imbibe.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="166"></L>

Dr. Prie&s;tley's di&s;covery of the production of pure air from &s;uch variety of &s;ub&s;tances will probably &s;oon be applied to the improvement of the diving bell, as the &s;ub&s;tances which contain vital air in immen&s;e quantities are of little value as mangane&s;e and minium. See additional notes, No. XXXIII. In every hundred weight of minium there is combined about twelve pounds of pure air, now as &s;ixty pounds of water are about a cubic foot, and as air is eight hundred times lighter than water, five hundred weight of minium will produce eight hundred cubic feet of air or about &s;ix thou&s;and gallons. Now, as this is at lea&s;t thrice as pure as atmo&s;pheric air, a gallon of it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;erve for three minutes re&s;piration for one man. At pre&s;ent the air can not be &s;et at liberty from minium by viriolic acid without the application of &s;ome heat, this is however very likely &s;oon to be di&s;covered, and will then enable adventurers to journey beneath the ocean in large inverted &s;hips or diving balloons.</P>
<P>Mr. Boyle relates, that Cornelius Drebelle contrived not only a ve&s;&s;el to be rowed under water, but al&s;o a liquor to be caried in that ve&s;&s;el, which would &s;upply the want of fre&s;h air. The ve&s;&s;el was made by order of James I. and carried twelve rowers be&s;ides pa&s;&s;engers. It was tried in the river Thames, and one of the per&s;ons who was in that &s;ubmarine voyage told the particulars of the experiments to a per&s;on who related them to Mr. Boyle.

Mr. Day peri&s;hed in a diving bell, or diving boat, of his own con&s;truction at Plymouth in June 1774, in which he was to have continued for a wager twelve hours one hundred feet deep in water, and probably peri&s;hed from his not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the hydro&s;tatic knowledge that was nece&s;&s;ary. See note on Ulva, Vol. II. of this work. See Annual Regi&s;ter for 1774. p. 245.</P>
<P>Mr. Spalding was profe&s;&s;ionally ingenious in the art of con&s;tructing and managing the diving bell, and had practi&s;ed the bu&s;ine&s;s many years with &s;ucce&s;s. He went down accompanied by one of his young men twice to view the wreck of the Imperial Ea&s;t-Indiaman at the Ki&s;h bank in Ireland. On de&s;cending the third time in June, 1783, they remained about an hour under water, and had two barrels of air &s;ent down to them, but on the &s;ignals from below not being again repeated, after a certain time, they were drawn up by their a&s;&s;i&s;tants and both found dead in the bell. Annual Regi&s;ter for 1783, p. 206. The&s;e two unhappy events may for a time check the ardor of adventurers in traver&s;ing the bottom of the ocean, but it is probable in another half century it may be &s;afer to travel under the ocean than over it, &s;ince Dr. Prie&s;tley's di&s;covery of procuring pure air in &s;uch great abundance from the calces of metals.</P></NOTE></L>

<P>A compleat cylinder of the bark about an inch in height was cut off from the branch of a pear tree again&s;t a wall in Mr. Howard's garden at Lichfield about five years ago, the circumci&s;ed part is now not above half the diameter of the branch above and below it, yet this branch has been full of fruit every year &s;ince, when the other branches of the tree bore only &s;paringly.

Another branch has the bark taken off not quite all round with much the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>The theory of this curious vegetable fact has been e&s;teemed difficult, but receives great light from the foregoing account of the individuallity of buds. A flower-bud dies, when it has perfected its &s;eed, like an annual plant, and hence requires no place on the bark for new roots to pa&s;s downwards; but on the contrary leaf-buds, as they advance into &s;hoots, form new buds in the axilla of every leaf, which new buds require new roots to pa&s;s down the bark, and thus thicken as well as elongate the branch, now if a wire or &s;tring be tied round the bark, many of the&s;e new roots cannot de&s;cend, and thence more of the buds will be converted into flower-buds.</P></NOTE></L>

The theory of this I &s;uppo&s;e to depend on the difficulty with which the leaf-&s;hoots can protrude the roots nece&s;&s;ary for their new progeny of buds upwards along the bended branch to the earth contrary to their natural habits or powers, whence more flower-&s;hoots are produced which do not require new roots to pa&s;s along the bark of the bended branch, but which let their offspring, the &s;eeds, fall upon the earth and &s;eek roots for them&s;elves.</P></NOTE></L>

This &s;pider is called by Linneus Arenea avicularia, with a convex orbicular thorax, the center tran&s;ver&s;ely excavated, he adds that it catches &s;mall birds as well as in&s;ects, and has the venemous bite of a &s;erpent.

<P>The &s;imilitude of this flower to this great &s;pider &s;eems to be a vegetable contrivance to prevent the humming-bird from plundering its honey.

<Q><L>Etherial Forms! you cha&s;e the &s;hooting &s;tars,</L>
<L>Or yoke the vollied lightnings to your cars.</L>
<BIBL>CANTO I. 1. 115.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THERE &s;eem to be three concentric &s;trata of our incumbent atmo&s;phere; in
which, or between them, are produced four kinds of meteors; lightning, &s;hooting &s;tars,
fire-balls, and northern lights. Fir&s;t, the lower region of air, or that which is den&s;e enough
to re&s;i&s;t by the adhe&s;ion of its particles the de&s;cent of conden&s;ed vapour, or clouds, which
may extend from one to three or four miles high. In this region the common lightning is
produced from the accumulation or defect of electric matter in tho&s;e floating fields of vapour
either in re&s;pect to each other, or in re&s;pect to the earth beneath them, or the di&s;&s;olved
vapour above them, which is con&s;tantly varying both with the change of the form of the
clouds, which thus evolve a greater or le&s;s &s;urface; and al&s;o with their ever-changing
degree of conden&s;ation. As the lightning is thus produced in den&s;e air, it proceeds but
a &s;hort cour&s;e on account of the greater re&s;i&s;tance which it encounters, is attended with
a loud explo&s;ion, and appears with a red light.</P>
<P>2. The &s;econd region of the atmo&s;phere I &s;uppo&s;e to be that which has too little
tenacity to &s;upport conden&s;ed vapour or clouds; but which yet contains invi&s;ible vapour,
or water in aerial &s;olution. This aerial &s;olution of water differs from that di&s;&s;olved in the
matter of heat, as it is supported by its adhe&s;ion to the particles of air, and is not pre|cipitated
by cold. In this &s;tratum it &s;eems probable that the meteors called &s;hooting
&s;tars are produced; and that they con&s;i&s;t of electric &s;parks, or lightning, pa&s;&s;ing from
one region to another of the&s;e invi&s;ible fields of aero-aqueous &s;olution. The height of
the&s;e &s;hooting &s;tars has not yet been a&s;certained by &s;ufficient ob&s;ervation; Dr. Blagden
thinks their &s;ituation is lower down in the atmo&s;phere than that of fireballs, which he
conjectures from their &s;wift apparent motion, and a&s;cribes their &s;mallne&s;s to the more
minute divi&s;ion of the electric matter of which they are suppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t, owing to
<PB N="2" REF="231">
the geater re&s;i&s;tance of the den&s;er medium through which they pa&s;s, than that in which
the fire-balls exi&s;t. Mr. Brydone ob&s;erved that the shooting stars appeared to him to be
as high in the atmo&s;phere, when he was near the summit of mount Etna, as they do
when ob&s;erved from the plain. Phil. Tran. Vol. LXIII.</P>
<P>As the stratum of air, in which shooting stars are suppo&s;ed to exi&s;t is much rarer
than that in which lightning re&s;ides, and yet much den&s;er than that in which fire|balls
are produced, they will be attracted at a greater di&s;tance than the former, and
at a le&s;s than the latter. From this rarity of the air so small a sound will be pro|duced
by their explo&s;ion, as not to reach the lower parts of the atmo&s;phere; their
quantity of light from their greater di&s;tance being small, is never seen through den&s;e
air at all, and thence does not appear red, like lightning or fire balls. There are
no apparent clouds to emit or to attract them, becau&s;e the con&s;tituent parts of the&s;e
aero-aqueous regions may po&s;&s;e&s;s an abundance or deficiency of electric matter and yet
be in perfect reciprocal solution. And la&s;tly their apparent train of light is probably owing
only to a continuance of their impre&s;&s;ion on the eye; as when a fire-stick is whirled in
the dark it gives the appearance of a compleat circle of fire: for the&s;e white trains of
shooting stars quickly vani&s;h, and do not seem to set any thing on fire in their pa&s;&s;age,
as seems to happen in the tran&s;it of fire-balls.</P>
<P>3. The second region or stratum of air terminates I suppo&s;e where the twilight cea&s;es
to be refracted, that is, where the air is 3000 times rarer than at the surface of the earth;
and where it seems probable that the common air ends, and is &s;urrounded by an atmo|&s;phere
of inflammable gas tenfold rarer than it&s;elf. In this region I believe fire-balls
&s;ometimes to pa&s;s, and at other times the northern lights to exi&s;t. One of the&s;e fire-balls
or draco volans, was ob&s;erved by Dr. Pringle and many others on Nov. 26, 1758, which
was afterwards e&s;timated to have been a mile and a half in circumference, to have been
about one hundred miles high, and to have moved towards the north with a velocity of
near thirty miles in a &s;econd of time. This meteor had a real tail many miles long,
which threw off &s;parks in its cour&s;e, and the whole exploded with a sound like di&s;tant
thunder. Philo&s;. Tran&s;. Vol. LI.</P>
<P>Dr. Blagden has related the hi&s;tory of another large meteor, or fire-ball, which was
&s;een the 18th of Augu&s;t, 1783, with many ingenious ob&s;ervations and conjectures.
This was e&s;timated to be between 60 and 70 miles high, and to travel 1000 miles at the
rate of about twenty miles in a &s;econd. This fire-ball had likewi&s;e a real train of light
left behind it in its pa&s;&s;age, which varied in colour; and in &s;ome part of its cour&s;e gave
off &s;parks or explo&s;ions where it had been brighte&s;t; and a du&s;ky red streak remained
vi&s;ible perhaps a minute. Philo&s;. Tran&s;. Vol. LXXIV.</P>
<P>The&s;e fire-balls differ from lightning, and from &s;hooting &s;tars in many remarkable
circum&s;tances; as their very great bulk, being a mile and a half in diameter; their tra|velling
1000 miles nearly horizontally; their throwing off sparks in their pa&s;&s;age; and
changing colours from bright blue to du&s;ky red; and leaving a train of fire behind them,
continuing about a minute. They differ from the northern lights in not being diffu&s;ed,
but pa&s;&s;ing from one point of the heavens to another in a defined line; and this in a
region above the crepu&s;cular atmo&s;phere, where the air is 3000 times rarer than at the
<PB N="3" REF="232">
&s;urface of the earth. There has not yet been even a conjecture which can account for
the&s;e appearances!&mdash;One I &s;hall therefore hazard; which, if it does not inform, may
amu&s;e the reader.</P>
<P>In the note on l. 123, it was &s;hewn that there is probably a &s;upernatant &s;tratum of
inflammable gas or hydrogene, over the common atmo&s;phere; and who&s;e den&s;ity at the
&s;urface where they meet, mu&s;t be at lea&s;t ten times le&s;s than that upon which it &s;wims;
like chemical ether floating upon water, and perhaps without any real contact. 1. In
this region, where the aerial atmo&s;phere terminates and the inflammable one begins, the
quantity of tenacity or re&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t be almo&s;t inconceivable; in which a ball of elec|tricity
might pa&s;s 1000 miles with greater ea&s;e than through a thou&s;andth part of an
inch of gla&s;s. 2. Such a ball of electricity pa&s;&s;ing between inflammable and common air
would &s;et fire to them in a line as it pa&s;&s;ed along; which would differ in colour accord|ing
to the greater proportionate commixture of the two airs; and from the same cau&s;e
there might occur greater degrees of inflammation, or branches of fire, in &s;ome parts of
its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>As the&s;e fire-balls travel in a defined line, it is pretty evident from the known laws of
electricity, that they mu&s;t be attracted; and as they are a mile or more in diameter, they
mu&s;t be emitted from a large &s;urface of electric matter; becau&s;e large nobs give larger
&s;parks, le&s;s diffu&s;ed, and more brightly luminous, than le&s;s ones or points, and re&s;i&s;t
more forceably the emi&s;&s;ion of the electric matter. What is there in nature can attract
them at &s;o great a di&s;tance as 1000 miles, and so forceably as to detach an electric &s;park
of a mile diameter? Can volcanos at the time of their eruptions have this effect, as they
are generally attended with lightning? Future ob&s;ervations mu&s;t di&s;cover the&s;e &s;ecret
operations of nature! As a stream of common air is carried along with the pa&s;&s;age of
electric aura from one body to another; it is ea&s;y to conceive, that the common air and
the inflammable air between which the fire-ball is &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s, will be partially
intermixed by being thus agitated, and &s;o far as it becomes intermixed it will take fire,
and produce the linear flame and branching &s;parks above de&s;cribed. In this circum&s;tance
of their being attracted, and thence pa&s;&s;ing in a defined line, the fire-balls &s;eem to differ
from the coru&s;cations of the aurora borealis, or northern lights, which probably take
place in the &s;ame region of the atmo&s;phere; where the common air exi&s;ts in extreme
tenuity, and is covered by a &s;till rarer &s;phere of inflammable gas, ten times lighter than
it&s;elf.</P>
<P>As the electric &s;treams, which con&s;titute the&s;e northern lights, &s;eem to be repelled or
radiated from an accumulation of that fluid in the north, and not attracted like the fire|balls;
this accounts for the diffu&s;ion of their light, as well as the &s;ilence of their pa&s;&s;age;
while their variety of colours, and the permanency of them, and even the breadth of
them in different places, may depend on their &s;etting on fire the mixture of inflammable
and common air through which they pa&s;s; as &s;eems to happen in the tran&s;it of the
fire-balls.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="233">
It was ob&s;erved by Dr. Prie&s;tley that the electric &s;hock taken through inflammable air
was red, in common air it is bluei&s;h; to the&s;e circum&s;tances perhaps &s;ome of the colours
of the northern lights may bear analogy; though the den&s;ity of the medium through
which light is &s;een mu&s;t principally vary its colour, as is well explained by Mr. Morgan.
Phil. Tran&s;. Vol. LXXV. Hence lightning is red when &s;een through a dark cloud, or
near the horizon; becau&s;e the more refrangible rays cannot permeate so den&s;e a medium.
But the &s;hooting &s;tars con&s;i&s;t of white light, as they are generally &s;een on clear nights,
and nearly vertical: in other &s;ituations their light is probably too faint to come to us.
But as in &s;ome remarkable appearances of the northern lights, as in March, 1716, all
the pri&s;matic colours were &s;een quickly to &s;ucceed each other, the&s;e appear to have been
owing to real combu&s;tion; as the den&s;ity of the interpo&s;ed medium could not be &s;uppo&s;ed
to change &s;o frequently; and therefore the&s;e colours mu&s;t have been owing to different
degrees of heat according to Mr. Morgan's theory of combu&s;tion. In Smith's Optics,
p. 69. the pri&s;matic colours, and optical deceptions of the northern lights are de&s;cribed
by Mr. Cotes.</P>
<P>The Torricellian vacuum, if perfectly free from air, is &s;aid by Mr. Morgan and
others to be a perfect non-conductor. This circum&s;tance therefore would preclude the
electric &s;treams from ri&s;ing above the atmo&s;phere. But as Mr. Morgan did not try to
pa&s;s an electric &s;hock through a vacuum, and as air, or &s;omething containing air, sur|rounding
the tran&s;it of electricity may be nece&s;&s;ary to the production of light, the con|clu&s;ion
may perhaps still be dubious. If however the streams of the northern lights were
suppo&s;ed to ri&s;e above our atmo&s;phere, they would only be vi&s;ible at each extremity of
their cour&s;e; where they emerge from, or are again immerged into the atmo&s;phere; but
not in their journey through the vacuum; for the ab&s;ence of electric light in a vacuum is
&s;ufficiently proved by the common experiment of &s;haking a barometer in the dark; the
electricity, produced by the friction of the mercury in the gla&s;s at its top, is luminous if
the barometer has a little air in it; but there is no light if the vacuum be complete.</P>
<P>The aurora borealis, or northern dawn, is very ingeniou&s;ly accounted for by Dr.
Franklin on principles of electricity. He premi&s;es the following electric phenomena:
1. that all new fallen snow has much po&s;itive electricity standing on its &s;urface. 2. That
about twelve degrees of latitude round the poles are covered with a cru&s;t of eternal ice,
which is impervious to the electric fluid. 3. That the den&s;e part of the atmo&s;phere ri&s;es
but a few miles high; and that in the rarer parts of it the electric fluid will pa&s;s to almo&s;t
any di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Hence he suppo&s;es there mu&s;t be a great accumulation of po&s;itive electric matter on the
fre&s;h fallen &s;now in the polar regions; which, not being able to pa&s;s through the cru&s;t of
ice into the earth, mu&s;t ri&s;e into the rare air of the upper parts of our atmo&s;phere, which
will the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;t its pa&s;&s;age; and pa&s;&s;ing towards the equator de&s;cend again into the
den&s;er atmo&s;phere, and thence into the earth in silent streams. And that many of the
appearances attending the&s;e lights are optical deceptions, owing to the situation of the
eye that beholds them; which makes all a&s;cending parallel lines appear to converge to a
point.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="234">
The idea, above explained in note on l. 123, of the exi&s;tence of a sphere of inflam|mable
gas over the aerial atmo&s;phere would much favour this theory of Dr. Franklin;
becau&s;e in that ca&s;e the den&s;e aerial atmo&s;phere would ri&s;e a much le&s;s height in the
polar regions, dimini&s;hing almo&s;t to nothing at the pole it&s;elf; and thus give an
ea&s;ier pa&s;&s;age to the a&s;cent of the electric fluid. And from the great difference in
the &s;pecific gravity of the two airs, and the velocity of the earth's rotation, there
mu&s;t be a place between the poles and the equator, where the superior atmo&s;phere
of inflammable gas would terminate; which would account for the&s;e &s;treams of the
aurora borealis not appearing near the equator; add to this that it is probable the electric
fluid may be heavier than the magnetic one; and will thence by the rotation of the
earth's surface a&s;cend over the magnetic one by its centrifugal force; and may thus be
induced to ri&s;e through the thin &s;tratum of aerial atmo&s;phere over the poles. See note
on Canto II. l. 193. I &s;hall have occa&s;ion again to mention this great accumulation of
inflammable air over the poles; and to conjecture that the&s;e northern lights may be pro|duced
by the union of inflammable with common air, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
electric &s;park to throw them into combu&s;tion.</P>
<P>The antiquity of the appearance of northern lights has been doubted; as none were
recorded in our annals &s;ince the remarkable one on Nov. 14, 1574, till another remark|able
one on March 6, 1716, and the three following nights, which were &s;een at the
same time in Ireland, Ru&s;&s;ia, and Poland, extending near 30 degrees of longitude and
from about the 50th degree of latitude over almo&s;t all the north of Europe. There is
however rea&s;on to believe them of remote antiquity though inaccurately de&s;cribed; thus

<Q>Through all the city, for the &s;pace of almo&s;t forty days, there were &s;een hor&s;emen run|ning
in the air, in cloth of gold, and armed with lances, like a band of &s;oldiers; and
troops of hor&s;emen in array encountering and running one again&s;t another, with &s;hak|ing
of &s;hields and multitude of pikes, and drawing of &s;words, and ca&s;ting of darts, and
glittering of golden ornaments and harne&s;s.</Q></P>

<P>THE manner in which the rainbow is produced was in some mea&s;ure under&s;tood
before Sir I&s;aac Newton had di&s;covered his theory of colours. The fir&s;t per&s;on who
expre&s;&s;ly &s;hewed the rainbow to be formed by the reflection of the sunbeams from drops
of falling rain was Antonio de Dominis. This was afterwards more fully and di&s;tinctly
explained by Des Cartes. But what cau&s;ed the diver&s;ity of its colours was not then un|der&s;tood;
it was re&s;erved for the immortal Newton to di&s;cover that the rays of light con|si&s;ted
of &s;even combined colours of different refrangibility, which could be &s;eperated at
plea&s;ure by a wedge of gla&s;s. Pemberton's View of Newton.</P>
<P>Sir I&s;aac Newton di&s;covered that the pri&s;matic &s;pectrum was compo&s;ed of &s;even colours
in the following proportions, violet 80, indigo 40, blue 60, green 60, yellow 48, orange 27,
red 45. If all the&s;e colours be painted on a circular card in the proportions above men|tioned,
and the card be rapidly whirled on its center, they produce in the eye the &s;en&s;a|tion
of white. And any one of the&s;e colours may be imitated by painting a card with
the two colours which are contiguous to it, in the &s;ame proportions as in the &s;pectrum,
and whirling them in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>My ingenious friend, Mr. Galton of Birmingham, a&s;certained in this manner by a set
of experiments the following propo&s;itions; the truth of which he had preconceived from
the above data.</P>
<P>1. Any colour in the pri&s;matic &s;pectrum may be imitated by a mixture of the two
colours contiguous to it.</P>
<P>2. If any three succe&s;&s;ive colours in the pri&s;matic &s;pectrum are mixed, they compo&s;e
only the &s;econd or middlemo&s;t colour.</P>
<P>3. If any four succe&s;&s;ive colours in the pri&s;matic &s;pectrum be mixed, a tint similar to
a mixture of the &s;econd and third colours will be produced, but not preci&s;ely the &s;ame,
becau&s;e they are not in the &s;ame proportion.</P>
<P>4. If beginning with any colour in the circular &s;pectrum, you take of the &s;econd
colour a quantity equal to the fir&s;t, second, and third; and add to that the fifth colour,
equal in quantity to the fourth, fifth, and &s;ixth; and with the&s;e combine the &s;eventh
colour in the proportion it exi&s;ts in the &s;pectrum, white will be produced. Becau&s;e the
fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third, compo&s;e only the &s;econd; and the fourth, fifth, and &s;ixth, com|po&s;e
only the fifth; therefore if the &s;eventh be added, the &s;ame effect is produced, as if
all the &s;even were employed.</P>
<P>5. Beginning with any colour in the circular &s;pectrum, if you take a tint compo&s;ed of
a certain proportion of the &s;econd and third, (equal in quantity to the fir&s;t, &s;econd, third,
and fourth,) and add to this the &s;ixth colour equal in quantity to the fifth, &s;ixth, and
&s;eventh, white will be produced.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="236">
From the&s;e curious experiments of Mr. Galton many phenomena in the chemical
changes of colours may probably become better under&s;tood; e&s;pecially if, as I &s;uppo&s;e,
the &s;ame theory mu&s;t apply to tran&s;mitted colours, as to reflected ones. Thus it is well
known, that if the gla&s;s of mangone&s;e, which is a tint probably compo&s;ed of violet and
indigo, be mixed in a certain proportion with the gla&s;s of lead, which is yellow; that the
mixture becomes tran&s;parent. Now from Mr. Galton's experiments it appears, that in
reflected colours such a mixture would produce white, that is, the same as if all the colours
were reflected. And therefore in tran&s;mitted colours the &s;ame circum&s;tances mu&s;t pro|duce
tran&s;parency, that is, the same as if all the colours were tran&s;mitted. For the
particles, which con&s;titute the gla&s;s of mangone&s;e will tran&s;mit red, violet, indigo, and blue;
and tho&s;e of the gla&s;s of lead will tran&s;mit orange, yellow, and green; hence all the
primary colours by a mixture of the&s;e gla&s;&s;es become tran&s;mitted, that is, the gla&s;s
becomes tran&s;parent.</P>
<P>Mr. Galton has further ob&s;erved that five succe&s;&s;ive pri&s;matic colours may be com|bined
in &s;uch proportions as to produce but one colour, a circum&s;tance which might be
of con&s;equence in the art of painting. For if you begin at any part of the circular
spectrum above de&s;cribed, and take the fir&s;t, second, and third colours in the proportions
in which they exi&s;t in the &s;pectrum; the&s;e will compo&s;e only the &s;econd colour equal in
quantity to the fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third; add to the&s;e the third, fourth, and fifth in the
proportion they exi&s;t in the &s;pectrum, and the&s;e will produce the fourth colour equal in
quantity to the third, fourth, and fifth. Con&s;equently this is preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing, as
mixing the &s;econd and fourth colours only; which mixture would only produce the third
colour. Therefore if you combine the fir&s;t, &s;econd, fourth, and fifth in the proportions
in which they exi&s;t in the &s;pectrum, with double the quantity of the third colour, this
third colour will be produced. It is probable that many of the unexpected changes in
mixing colours on a painter's ea&s;le, as well as in more fluid chemical mixtures, may
depend on the&s;e principles rather than on a new arrangement or combination of their
minute particles.</P>
<P>Mr. Galton further ob&s;erves, that white may univer&s;ally be produced by the com|bination
of one pri&s;matic colour, and a tint intermediate to two others. Which tint may
be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a name compounded of the two colours, to which it is intermediate.
Thus white is produced by a mixture of red with blue-green. Of orange with indigo|blue.
Of Yellow with violet-indigo. Of green with red-violet. Of blue with Orange-red.
Of indigo with yellow-orange. Of violet with green-yellow. Which he further remarks
exactly coincides with the theory and facts mentioned by Dr. Robert Darwin of Shrew&s;|bury
in his account of ocular &s;pectra; who has &s;hewn that when one of the&s;e contra&s;ted
colours has been long viewed, a &s;pectrum or appearance of the other becomes vi&s;ible in
the fatigued eye. Philo&s;. Tran&s;. Vol. LXXVI. for the year 1786.</P>
<P>The&s;e experiments of Mr. Galton might much a&s;&s;i&s;t the copper-plate printers of
callicoes and papers in colours; as three colours or more might be produced by two
copper-plates. Thus &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome yellow figures were put on by the fir&s;t plate, and
upon &s;ome parts of the&s;e yellow figures and on other parts of the ground blue was laid
on by another copper-plate. The three colours of yellow, blue, and green might be
produced; as green leaves with yellow and blue flowers.</P>

<P>THE rays from the ri&s;ing and &s;etting &s;un are refracted by our &s;pherical atmo&s;phere,
hence the mo&s;t refrangible rays, as the violet, indigo, and blue are reflected in greater
quantities from the morning and evening &s;kies; and the lea&s;t refrangible ones, as red
and orange, are la&s;t &s;een about the &s;etting &s;un. Hence Mr. Beguelin ob&s;erved that the
&s;hadow of his finger on his pocket-book was much bluer in the morning and evening,
when the &s;hadow was about eight times as long as the body from which it was projected.
Mr. Melville ob&s;erves, that the blue rays being more refrangible are bent down in the
evenings by our atmo&s;phere, while the red and orange being le&s;s refrangible continue to
pa&s;s on and tinge the morning and evening clouds with their colours. See Prie&s;tley's
Hi&s;tory of Light and Colours, p. 440. But as the particles of air, like tho&s;e of water,
are them&s;elves blue, a blue &s;hadow may be &s;een at all times of the day, though much
more beautifully in the mornings and evenings, or by means of a candle in the middle
of the day. For if a &s;hadow on a piece of white paper is produced by placing your finger
between the paper and a candle in the day light, the &s;hadow will appear very blue; the
yellow light of the candle upon the other parts of the paper apparently deepens the blue
by its contra&s;t; the&s;e colours being oppo&s;ite to each other, as explained in note II.</P>
<P>Colours are produced from clouds or mi&s;ts by refraction, as well as by reflection.
In riding in the night over an unequal country I ob&s;erved a very beautiful coloured
halo round the moon, whenever I was covered with a few feet of mi&s;t, as I a&s;cended
from the vallies; which cea&s;ed to appear when I ro&s;e above the mi&s;t. This I &s;uppo&s;e
was owing to the thinne&s;s of the stratum of mi&s;t, in which I was immer&s;ed; had it been
thicker, the colours refracted by the &s;mall drops, of which a fog con&s;i&s;ts, would not
have pa&s;&s;ed through it down to my eye.</P>
<P>There is a bright &s;pot seen on the cornea of the eye, when we face a window, which
is much attended to by portrait painters; this is the light reflected from the &s;pherical
surface of the poli&s;hed cornea, and brought to a focus; if the ob&s;erver is placed in this
focus, he &s;ees the image of the window; if he is placed before or behind the focus, he
only sees a luminous &s;pot, which is more luminous and of le&s;s extent, the nearer he
approaches to the focus. The luminous appearance of the eyes of animals in the du&s;ky
corners of a room, or in holes in the earth, may ari&s;e in &s;ome in&s;tances from the same
principle; viz. the reflection of the light from the spherical cornea; which will be coloured
red or blue in &s;ome degree by the morning, evening, or meridian light; or by the objects
from which that light is previou&s;ly reflected. In the cavern at Colebrook Dale, where
the mineral tar ex&s;udes, the eyes of the hor&s;e, which was drawing a cart from within
<PB N="9" REF="238">
towards the mouth of it, appeared like two balls of pho&s;phorus, when he was above 100
yards off, and for a long time before any other part of the animal was vi&s;ible. In this
ca&s;e I su&s;pect the luminous appearance to have been owing to the light, which had entered
the eye, being reflected from the back surface of the vitreous humour, and thence emerg|ing
again in parallel rays from the animals eye, as it does from the back surface of the
drops of the rainbow, and from the water-drops which lie, perhaps without contact, on
cabbage leaves, and have the brilliancy of quick&s;ilver. This accounts for this luminous
appearance being be&s;t seen in tho&s;e animals which have large apertures in their iris, as in
cats and hor&s;es, and is the only part vi&s;ible in ob&s;cure places, becau&s;e this is a better re|flecting
surface than any other part of the animal. If any of the&s;e emergent rays from the
animals eye can be suppo&s;ed to have been reflected from the choroid coat through the
semi-tran&s;parent retina, this would account for the coloured glare of the eyes of dogs or
cats and rabits in dark corners.</P>

<BIBL>CANTO I. l. 134.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THERE have been many theories invented to account for the tails of comets. Sir
I&s;aac Newton thinks that they con&s;i&s;t of rare vapours rai&s;ed from the nucleus of the comet,
and &s;o rarefied by the sun's heat as to have their general gravitation dimini&s;hed, and that
they in con&s;equence a&s;cend oppo&s;ite to the &s;un, and from thence reflect the rays of light.
Dr. Halley compares the light of the tails of comets to the &s;treams of the aurora berealis,
and other electric effluvia. Philo&s;. Tran&s;. No. 347.</P>
<P>Dr. Hamilton ob&s;erves that the light of &s;mall &s;tars are &s;een undimini&s;hed through
both the light of the tails of comets, and of the aurora borealis, and has further illu&s;trated
their electric analogy, and adds that the tails of comets con&s;i&s;t of a lucid &s;elf-&s;hining &s;ub|&s;tance
which has not the power of refracting or reflecting the rays of light. E&s;&s;ays.</P>
<P>The tail of the comet of 1744 at one time appeared to extend above 16 degrees from
its body, and mu&s;t have thence been above twenty three millions of miles long. And
the comet of 1680, according to the calculations of Dr. Halley on November the 11th,
was not above one &s;emi-diameter of the earth, or le&s;s than 4000 miles to the northward
of the way of the earth; at which time had the earth been in that part of its orbit, what
might have been the con&s;equence! no one would probably have &s;urvived to have
regi&s;tered the tremendous effects.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="239">
The comet of 1531, 1607, and 1682 having returned in the year 1759, according to
Dr. Halley's prediction in the Philo&s;. Tran&s;. for 1705, there &s;eems no rea&s;on to doubt
that all the other comets will return after their proper periods. A&s;tronomers have in
general acquie&s;ced in the conjecture of Dr. Halley, that the comets of 1532, and 1661
are one and the &s;ame comet, from the &s;imilarity of the elements of their orbits, and were
therefore induced to expect its return to its perihelium 1789. As this comet is liable to
be di&s;turbed in its a&s;cent from the &s;un by the planets Jupiter and Saturn, Dr. Ma&s;kelyne
expected its return to its perihelium in the beginning of the year 1789, or the latter end
of the year 1788, and certainly &s;ometime before the 27th of April, 1789, which pre|diction
has not been fulfilled. Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXVI.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE V.&mdash;SUN'S RAYS.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Or give the sun's phlogi&s;tic orb to roll. </L><BIBL>CANTO I. l. 136.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE di&s;pute among philo&s;ophers about phlogi&s;ton is not concerning the exi&s;tence of
an inflammable principle, but rather whether there be one or more inflammable principles.
The di&s;ciples of Stahl, which till lately included the whole chemical world, believed in
the identity of phlogi&s;ton in all bodies which would flame or calcine. The di&s;ciples of
Lavoi&s;ier pay homage to a plurality of phlogi&s;tons under the various names of charcoal,
sulphur, metals, &amp;c. Whatever will unite with <HI>pure</HI> air, and thence compo&s;e an acid, is
e&s;teemed in this ingenious theory to be a different kind of phlogi&s;tic or inflammable body.
At the same time there remains a doubt whether the&s;e inflammable bodies, as metals,
&s;ulphur, charcoal, &amp;c. may not be compounded of the &s;ame phlogi&s;ton along with &s;ome
other material yet undi&s;covered, and thus an unity of phlogi&s;ton exi&s;t, as in the theory of
Stahl, though very differently applied in the explication of chemical phenomena.</P>
<P>Some modern philo&s;ophers are of opinion that the &s;un is the great fountain from
which the earth and other planets derive all the phlogi&s;ton which they po&s;&s;es; and that
this is formed by the combination of the &s;olar rays with all opake bodies, but particularly
with the leaves of vegetables, which they suppo&s;e to be organs adapted to ab&s;orb them.
And that as animals receive their nouri&s;hment from vegetables they al&s;o obtain in a
&s;econdary manner their phlogi&s;ton from the &s;un. And la&s;tly as great ma&s;&s;es of the mineral
kingdom, which have been found in the thin cru&s;t of the earth which human labour has
penetrated, have evidently been formed from the recrements of animal and vegetable
bodies, the&s;e al&s;o are suppo&s;ed thus to have derived their phlogi&s;ton from the sun.</P>
<P>Another opinion concerning the &s;un's rays is, that they are not luminous till they
arrive at our atmo&s;phere; and that there uniting with &s;ome part of the air they produce
<PB N="11" REF="240">
combu&s;tion, and light is emitted, and that an etherial acid, yet undi&s;covered, is formed
from this combu&s;tion.</P>
<P>The more probable opinion is perhaps, that the &s;un is a phlogi&s;tic ma&s;s of matter,
who&s;e &s;urface is in a &s;tate of combu&s;tion, which like other burning bodies emits light
with immen&s;e velocity in all directions; that the&s;e rays of light act upon all opake
bodies, and combining with them either di&s;place or produce their elementary heat, and
become chemically combined with the phlogi&s;tic part of them; for light is given out
when phlogi&s;tic bodies unite with the oxygenous principle of the air, as in combu&s;tion,
or in the reduction of metallic calxes; thus in pre&s;enting to the flame of a candle a letter|wafer,
(if it be coloured with red-lead,) at the time the red-lead becomes a metallic drop,
a fla&s;h of light is perceived. Dr. Alexander Wil&s;on very ingeniou&s;ly endeavours to prove
that the sun is only in a &s;tate of combu&s;tion on its &s;urface, and that the dark &s;pots &s;een on
the di&s;k are excavations or caverns through the luminous cru&s;t, some of which are 4000
miles in diameter. Phil. Trans. 1774. Of this I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to speak again.</P>

<P>M. DE MAIRAN in a paper publi&s;hed in the Hi&s;toire de l'Academic de Sciences,
1765, has endeavoured to &s;hew that the earth receives but a &s;mall part of the heat which
it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, from the &s;un's rays, but is principally heated by fires within it&s;elf. He thinks
the &s;un is the cau&s;e of the vici&s;&s;itudes of our &s;ea&s;ons of &s;ummer and winter by a very
&s;mall quantity of heat in addition to that already re&s;iding in the earth, which by emana|tions
from the centre to the circumference renders the &s;urface habitable, and without
which, though the &s;un was con&s;tantly to illuminate two thirds of the globe at once,
with a heat equal to that at the equator, it would &s;oon become a ma&s;s of &s;olid ice. His
rea&s;onings and calculations on this &s;ubject are too long and too intricate to be in|serted
here, but are equally curious and ingenious and carry much conviction along with
them.</P>
<P>The opinion that the center of the earth con&s;i&s;ts of a large ma&s;s of burning lava, has
been e&s;pou&s;ed by Boyle, Boerhave, and many other philo&s;ophers. Some of whom con|&s;idering
its &s;uppo&s;ed effects on vegetation and the formation of minerals have called it a
&s;econd &s;un. There are many arguments in &s;upport of this opinion. 1. Becau&s;e the
power of the &s;un does not extend much beyond ten feet deep into the earth, all below
being in winter and &s;ummer always of the &s;ame degree of heat, viz. 48, which being
<PB N="12" REF="241">
much warmer than the milde&s;t fro&s;t, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;u&s;tained by &s;ome internal di&s;tant
fire. Add to this however that from experiments made &s;ome years ago by Dr. Franklin
the &s;pring-water at Philadelphia appeared to be of 52&deg; of heat, which &s;eems further to
confirm this opinion, &s;ince the climates in North America are &s;uppo&s;ed to be colder
than tho&s;e of Europe under &s;imilar degrees of latitude. 2. Mr. De Luc in going 1359
feet perpendicular into the mines of Hartz on July the 5th, 1778, on a very fine day found
the air at the bottom a little warmer than at the top of the &s;haft. Phil. Tran&s;. Vol.
LXIX. p. 488. In the mines in Hungary, which are 500 cubits deep, the heat becomes
very trouble&s;ome when the miners get below 480 feet depth. <HI>Morinus de Locis &s;ubter.</HI>
p. 131. But as &s;ome other deep mines as mentioned by Mr. Kirwan are &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s but
the common heat of the earth; and as the cru&s;t of the globe thus penetrated by human
labour is &s;o thin compared with the whole, no certain deduction can be made from the&s;e
facts on either &s;ide of the que&s;tion. 3. The warm-&s;prings in many parts of the earth at
great di&s;tance from any Volcanos &s;eem to originate from the conden&s;ation of vapours
ari&s;ing from water which is boiled by &s;ubterraneous fires, and cooled again in their pas|&s;age
through a certain length of the colder &s;oil; for the theory of chemical &s;olution will
not explain the equality of their heat at all &s;ea&s;ons and through &s;o many centuries. See
note on Fucus in Vol. II. See a letter on this &s;ubject in Mr. Pilkinton's View of Derby|&s;hire
from Dr. Darwin. 4. From the &s;ituations of volcanos which are always found
upon the &s;ummit of the highe&s;t mountains. For as the&s;e mountains have been lifted up
and lo&s;e &s;everal of their uppermo&s;t &s;trata as they ri&s;e, the lowe&s;t &s;trata of the earth yet
known appear at the tops of the highe&s;t hills; and the beds of the Volcanos upon the&s;e
hills mu&s;t in con&s;equence belong to the lowe&s;t &s;trata of the earth, con&s;i&s;ting perhaps of
granite or ba&s;altes, which were produced before the exi&s;tance of animal or vegetable
bodies, and might con&s;titute the original nucleus of the earth, which I have &s;uppo&s;ed
to have been projected from the &s;un, hence the volcanos them&s;elves appear to be &s;pira|cula
or chimneys belonging to great central fires. It is probably owing to the e&s;cape of
the ela&s;tic vapours from the&s;e &s;piracula that the modern earthquakes are of &s;uch &s;mall ex|tent
compared with tho&s;e of remote antiquity, of which the ve&s;tiges remain all over the
globe. 5. The great &s;ize and height of the continents, and the great &s;ize and depth of
the South-&s;ea, Atlantic, and other oceans, evince that the fir&s;t earthquakes, which pro|duced
the&s;e immen&s;e changes in the globe, mu&s;t have been occa&s;ioned by central fires.
6. The very di&s;tant and expeditious communication of the &s;hocks of &s;ome great earth|quakes.
The earthquake at Li&s;bon in 1755 was perceived in Scotland, in the Peak of
Derby&s;hire, and in many other di&s;tant parts of Europe. The percu&s;&s;ions of it travelled
with about the velocity of &s;ound, viz. about thirteen miles in a minute. The earthquake
in 1693 extended 2600 leagues. (Gold&s;mith's Hi&s;tory.) The&s;e phenomena are ea&s;ily ex|plained
if the central parts of the earth con&s;i&s;t of a fluid lava, as a percu&s;&s;ion on one part
of &s;uch a fluid ma&s;s would be felt on other parts of its confining vault, like a &s;troke on a
fluid contained in a bladder, which however gentle on one &s;ide is perceptible to the hand
placed on the other; and the velocity with which &s;uch a concu&s;&s;ion would travel would
be that of &s;ound, or thirteen miles in a minute. For further information on this part of
the &s;ubject the reader is referred to Mr. Michell's excellent Treati&s;e on Earthquakes in the
<PB N="13" REF="242">
Philos. Tran&s;. Vol. LI. 7. That there is a cavity at the center of the earth is made pro|bable
by the late experiments on the attraction of mountains by Mr. Ma&s;kerlyne, who &s;up|po&s;ed
from other con&s;iderations that the den&s;ity of the earth near the &s;urface &s;hould be
five times le&s;s than its mean den&s;ity. Phil. Trans. Vol. LXV. p. 498. But found from
the attraction of the mountain Schehallien, that it is probable, the mean den&s;ity of the
earth is but double that of the hill. Ibid. p. 532. Hence if the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition be well
founded there would appear to be a cavity at the centre of con&s;iderable magnitude, from
whence the immen&s;e beds and mountains of lava, toad&s;tone, ba&s;altes, granite, &amp;c. have
been protruded. 8. The variation of the compa&s;s can only be accounted for by &s;up|po&s;ing
the central parts of the earth to con&s;i&s;t of a fluid ma&s;s, and that part of this fluid
is iron, which requiring a greater degree of heat to bring it into fu&s;ion than gla&s;s or other
metals, remains a &s;olid, and the vis inertiae of this fluid ma&s;s with the iron in it, occa&s;ions
it to perform &s;ewer revolutions than the cru&s;t of &s;olid earth over it, and thus it is gradu|ally
left behind, and the place where the floating iron re&s;ides is pointed to by the direct
or retrograde motions of the magnetic needle. This &s;eems to have been nearly the
opinion of Dr. Halley and Mr. Euler.</P>

<Q><L>Or &s;phere on &s;phere in widening waves expand,</L>
<L>And glad with genial warmth the incumbent land. </L><BIBL>CANTO I. l. 143.</BIBL></Q>
<P>A CERTAIN quantity of heat &s;eems to be combined with all bodies be&s;ides the
&s;en&s;ible quantity which gravitates like the electric fluid among&s;t them. This combined
heat or latent heat of Dr. Black, when &s;et at liberty by fermentation, inflammation,
cry&s;tallization, freezing, or other chemical attractions producing new <HI>combinations,</HI> pa&s;&s;es
as a fluid element into the &s;urrounding bodies. And by thawing, diffu&s;ion of neutral
&s;alts in water, melting, and other chemical &s;olutions, a portion of heat is attracted from
the bodies in vicinity and enters into or becomes combined with the new &s;olutions.</P>
<P>Hence a combination of metals with acids, of e&s;&s;ential oils and acids, of alcohol and
water, of acids and water, give out heat; whil&s;t a <HI>&s;olution</HI> of &s;now in water or in acids,
and of neutral &s;alts in water, attract heat from the &s;urrounding bodies. So the acid of
nitre mixed with oil of cloves unites with it and produces a mo&s;t violent flame; the &s;ame
acid of nitre poured on &s;now in&s;tantly di&s;&s;olves it and produces the greate&s;t degree of cold
yet known, by which at Peter&s;burgh quick&s;ilver was fir&s;t frozen in 1760.</P>
<P>Water may be cooled below 32&deg; without being frozen, if it be placed on a &s;olid floor
and &s;ecured from agitation, but when thus cooled below the freezing point the lea&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="243">
agitation turns part of it &s;uddenly into ice, and when this &s;udden freezing takes place a
thermometer placed in it in&s;tantly ri&s;es as &s;ome heat is given out in the act of congelation,
and the ice is thus left with the &s;ame <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> degree of cold as the water had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
before it was agitated, but is neverthele&s;s now combined with le&s;s <HI>latent</HI> heat.</P>
<P>A cubic inch of water thus cooled down to 32&deg; mixed with an equal quantity of boil|ing
water at 212&deg; will cool it to the middle number between the&s;e two, or to 122. But
a cubit inch of ice who&s;e &s;en&s;ible cold al&s;o is but 32, mixed with an equal quantity of
boiling water, will cool it &s;ix times as much as the cubic inch of cold water above|mentioned,
as the ice not only gains its &s;hare of the &s;en&s;ible or gravitating heat of the
boiling water but attracts to it&s;elf al&s;o and combines with the quantity of latent heat
which it had lo&s;t at the time of its congelation.</P>
<P>So boiling water will acquire but 212&deg; of heat under the common pre&s;&s;ure of the at|mo&s;phere,
but the &s;team rai&s;ed from it by its expan&s;ion or by its &s;olution in the atmo|&s;phere
combines with and carries away a prodigious quantity of heat which it again parts
with on its conden&s;ation; as is &s;een in common di&s;tillation where the large quantity of
water in the worm-tub is &s;o &s;oon heated. Hence the evaporation of ether on a ther|mometer
&s;oon &s;inks the mercury below freezing, and hence a warmth of the air in winter
frequently &s;ucceeds a &s;hower.</P>
<P>When the matter of heat or calorique is &s;et at liberty from its combinations, as by
inflammation, it pa&s;&s;es into the &s;urrounding bodies, which po&s;&s;e&s;s different capacities of
acquiring their &s;hare of the loo&s;e or &s;en&s;ible heat; thus a pint mea&s;ure of cold water at 48&deg;
mixed with a pint of boiling water at 212&deg; will cool it to the degree between the&s;e two
numbers, or to 154&deg;, but it requires two pint mea&s;ures of quick&s;ilver at 48&deg; of heat to
cool one pint of water as above. The&s;e and other curious experiments are adduced by
Dr. Black to evince the exi&s;tance of combined or latent heat in bodies, as has been ex|plained
by &s;ome of his pupils, and well illu&s;trated by Dr. Crawford. The world has
long been in expectation of an account of his di&s;coveries on this &s;ubject by the celebrated
author him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As this doctrine of elementary heat in its fluid and combined &s;tate is not yet univer|&s;ally
received, I &s;hall here add two arguments in &s;upport of it drawn from different &s;ources,
viz. from the heat given out or ab&s;orbed by the mechanical conden&s;ation or expan&s;ion of
the air, and perhaps of other bodies, and from the analogy of the various phenomena of
heat with tho&s;e of electricity.</P>
<P>I. If a thermometer be placed in the receiver of an air-pump, and the air ha&s;tily ex|hau&s;ted,
the thermometer will &s;ink &s;ome degrees, and the gla&s;s become &s;teamy; the
&s;ame occurs in ha&s;tily admitting a part of the air again. This I &s;uppo&s;e to be produced
by the expan&s;ion of part of the air, both during the exhau&s;tion and re-admi&s;&s;ion of it;
and that the air &s;o expanded becomes capable of attracting from the bodies in its vicinity
a part of their heat, hence the vapours contained in it and the gla&s;s receiver are for a
time colder and the &s;team is precipitated. That the air thus parts with its moi&s;ture from
the cold occa&s;ioned by its rarefaction and not &s;imply by the rarefaction it&s;elf is evident,
becau&s;e in a minute or two the &s;ame rarefied air will again take up the dew depo&s;ited on
the receiver; and becau&s;e water will evaporate &s;ooner in rare than in den&s;e air.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="244">
There is a curious phenomenon &s;imilar to this ob&s;erved in the fountain of Hiero con|&s;tructed
on a large &s;cale at the Chemnicen&s;ian mines in Hungary. In this machine the air
in a large ve&s;&s;el is compre&s;&s;ed by a column of water 260 feet high, a &s;top-cock is then
opened, and as the air i&s;&s;ues out with great vehemence, and thus becomes immediately
greatly expanded, &s;o much cold is produced that the moi&s;ture from this &s;tream of air is
precipitated in the form of &s;now, and ice is formed adhering to the no&s;el of the cock.
This remarkable circum&s;tance is de&s;cribed at large with a plate of the machine in Philos.
Trans. Vol. LII. for 1761.</P>
<P>The following experiment is related by Dr. Darwin in the Philos. Trans. Vol.
LXXVIII. Having charged an air-gun as forcibly as he well could the air-cell and &s;yringe
became exceedingly hot, much more &s;o than could be a&s;cribed to the friction in working
it; it was then left about half an hour to cool down to the temperature of the air, and a
thermometer having been previou&s;ly fixed again&s;t a wall, the air was di&s;charged in a con|tinual
&s;tream on its bulb, and it &s;unk many degrees. From the&s;e three experiments
of the &s;team in the exhau&s;t&eacute;d receiver being depo&s;ited and re-ab&s;orbed, when a part of the
air is exhau&s;ted or re-admitted, and the &s;now produced by the fountain of Hiero, and
the extraordinary heat given out in charging, and the cold produced in di&s;charging an
air-gun, there is rea&s;on to conclude that when air is mechanically compre&s;&s;ed the
elementary fluid heat is pre&s;&s;ed out of it, and that when it is mechanically expanded the
&s;ame fluid heat is re-ab&s;orbed from the common ma&s;s.</P>
<P>It is probable all other bodies as well as air attract heat from their neighbours when
they are mechanically expanded, and give it out when they are mechanically conden&s;ed.
Thus when a vibration of the particles of hard bodies is excited by friction or by per|cu&s;&s;ion,
the&s;e particles mutually recede from and approach each other reciprocally; at
the times of their rece&s;&s;ion from each other, the body becomes enlarged in bulk, and is
then in a condition to attract heat from tho&s;e in its vicinity with great and &s;udden power;
at the times of their approach to each other this heat is again given out, but the bodies
in contact having in the mean while received the heat they had thus lo&s;t, from other
bodies behind them, do not &s;o &s;uddenly or &s;o forcibly re-ab&s;orb the heat again from the
body in vibration; hence it remains on its &s;urface like the electric fluid on a rubbed gla&s;s
globe, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, becau&s;e there is no good conductor to take it up again.
Hence at every vibration more and more heat is acquired and &s;tands loo&s;e upon the &s;ur|face;
as in filing metals or rubbing gla&s;s tubes; and thus a &s;mith with a few &s;trokes on
a nail on his anvil can make it hot enough to light a brim&s;tone-match; and hence in
&s;triking flint and &s;teel together heat enough is produced to vitrify the parts thus &s;trucken
off, the quantity of which heat is again probably increa&s;ed by the new chemical com|bination.</P>
<P>II. The analogy between the phenomena of the electric fluid and of heat furni&s;hes
another argument in &s;upport of the exi&s;tence of heat as a gravitating fluid. 1. They are
both accumulated by friction on the excited body. 2. They are propagated ea&s;ily or
with difficalty along the &s;ame cla&s;&s;es of bodies; with ea&s;e by metals, with le&s;s ea&s;e by
water; and with difficulty by re&s;ins, bees-wax, &s;ilk, air, and gla&s;s. Thus gla&s;s canes
or canes of &s;ealing-wax may be melted by a blow-pipe or a candle within a quarter of an
<PB N="16" REF="245">
inch of the fingers which hold them, without any inconvenient heat, while a pin or
other metallic &s;ub&s;tance applyed to the flame of a candle &s;o readily conducts the heat as
immediately to burn the fingers. Hence clothes of &s;ilk keep the body warmer than clothes
of linen of equal thickne&s;s, by confining the heat upon the body. And hence plains are
&s;o much warmer than the &s;ummits of mountains by the greater den&s;ity of the air con|fining
the acquired heat upon them. 3. They both give out light in their pa&s;&s;age
through air, perhaps not in their pa&s;&s;age through a vacuum. 4. They both of them
fu&s;e or vitrify metals. 5. Bodies after being electrized if they are mechanically ex|tended
will receive a greater quantity of electricity, as in Dr. Franklin's experiment of
the chain in the tankard; the &s;ame &s;eems true in re&s;pect to heat as explained above.
6. Both heat and electricity contribute to &s;u&s;pend &s;team in the atmo&s;phere by producing
or increa&s;ing the repul&s;ion of its particles. 7. They both gravitate, when they have
been accumulated, till they find their equilibrium.</P>
<P>If we add to the above the many chemical experiments which receive an ea&s;y and ele|gant
explanation from the &s;uppo&s;ed matter of heat, as employed in the works of Bergman
and Lavoi&s;ier, I think we may rea&s;onably allow of its exi&s;tence as an element, occa&s;ionally
combined with other bodies, and occa&s;ionally exi&s;ting as a fluid, like the electric fluid
gravitating among&s;t them, and that hence it may be propagated from the central fires
of the earth to the whole ma&s;s, and contribute to pre&s;erve the mean heat of the earth,
which in this country is about 48 degrees but variable from the greater or le&s;s effect of
the &s;un's heat in different climates, &s;o well explained in Mr. Kirwan's Treati&s;e on the
Temperature of different Latitudes. 1787, Elm&s;ly. London.</P>

<P>THE gigantic &s;tatue of Memnon in his temple at Thebes had a lyre in his hands, which
many credible writers a&s;&s;ure us, &s;ounded when the ri&s;ing &s;un &s;hone upon it. Some philo|&s;ophers
have &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;un's light po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a mechanical impul&s;e, and that the &s;ounds
abovementioned might be thence produced. Mr. Michell con&s;tructed a very tender hori|zontal
balance, as related by Dr. Prie&s;tley in his hi&s;tory of light and colours, for this pur|po&s;e,
but &s;ome experiments with this balance which I &s;aw made by the late Dr. Powel,
who threw the focus of a large reflector on one extremity of it, were not conclu&s;ive
eitherway, as the copper leaf of the balance approached in one experiment and receded
in another.</P>
<P>There are however methods by which either a rotative or alternating motion may be
produced by very moderate degrees of heat. If a &s;traight gla&s;s tube, &s;uch as are u&s;ed for
barometers, be &s;u&s;pended horizontally before a fire, like a roa&s;ting &s;pit, it will revolve by
intervals; for as gla&s;s is a bad conductor of heat the &s;ide next the fire becomes heated
&s;ooner than the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and the tube becomes bent into a bow with the external
part of the curve towards the fire, this curve then falls down and produces a fourth part
of a revolution of the gla&s;s tube, which thus revolves with intermediate pau&s;es.</P>
<P>Another alternating motion I have &s;een produced by &s;u&s;pending a gla&s;s tube about eight
inches long with bulbs at each end on a centre like a &s;cale beam. This curious machine
is filled about one third part with pure&s;t &s;pirit of wine, the other two thirds being a
vacuum, and is called a pul&s;e-gla&s;s, if it be placed in a box before the fire, &s;o that either
bulb, as it ri&s;es, may become &s;haded from the fire, and expo&s;ed to it when it de&s;cends, an
alternate libration of it is produced. For &s;pirit of wine in vacuo emits &s;team by a very
&s;mall degree of heat, and this &s;team forces the &s;pirit beneath it up into the upper bulb,
which therefore de&s;cends. It is probable &s;uch a machine on a larger &s;cale might be of
u&s;e to open the doors or windows of hot-hou&s;es or mellon-frames, when the air within
them &s;hould become too much heated, or might be employed in more important me|chanical
purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>On travelling through a hot &s;ummer's day in a chai&s;e with a box covered with leather
on the fore-axle-tree, I ob&s;erved, as the &s;un &s;hone upon the black leather, the box began
to open its lid, which at noon ro&s;e above a foot, and could not without great force be
pre&s;&s;ed down; and which gradually clo&s;ed again as the &s;un declined in the evening. This
I &s;uppo&s;e might with &s;till greater facility be applied to the purpo&s;e of opening melon|frames
or the &s;a&s;hes of hot-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;tatue of Memnon was overthrown and &s;awed in two by Camby&s;es to di&s;cover
its internal &s;tructure, and is &s;aid &s;till to exi&s;t. See Savary's Letters on Egypt. The trun|cated

<P>THERE are eighteen &s;pecies of Lampyris or glow-worm, according to Linneus,
&s;ome of which are found in almo&s;t every part of the world. In many of the &s;pecies
the females have no wings, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to be di&s;covered by the winged males by
their &s;hining in the night. They become much more lucid when they put them&s;elves
in motion, which would &s;eem to indicate that their light is owing to their re&s;piration; in
which proce&s;s it is probable pho&s;phoric acid is produced by the combination of vital air
with &s;ome part of the blood, and that light is given out through their tran&s;parent bodies
by this &s;low internal combu&s;tion.</P>
<P>There is a fire-fly of the beetle-kind de&s;cribed in the Dict. Rai&s;onn&eacute; under the name
of Acudia, which is &s;aid to be two inches long, and inhabits the We&s;t-Indies and South
America; the natives u&s;e them in&s;tead of candles, putting from one to three of them
under a gla&s;s. Madam Merian &s;ays, that at Surinam the light of this fly is &s;o great,
that &s;he &s;aw &s;ufficiently well by one of them to paint and fini&s;h one of the figures of
them in her work on in&s;ects. The large&s;t and olde&s;t of them are &s;aid to become four
inches long, and to &s;hine like a &s;hooting &s;tar as they fly, and are thence called Lantern|bearers.
The u&s;e of this light to the in&s;ect it&s;elf &s;eems to be that it may not fly again&s;t
objects in the night; by which contrivance the&s;e in&s;ects are enabled to procure their
&s;u&s;tenance either by night or day, as their wants may require, or their numerous enemies
permit them; whereas &s;ome of our beetles have eyes adapted only to the night, and if

<P>In &s;ome &s;eas, as particularly about the coa&s;t of Malabar, as a &s;hip floats along, it &s;eems

<P>KUNCKEL, a native of Hamburgh, was the fir&s;t who di&s;covered to the world
the proce&s;s for producing pho&s;phorus; though Brandt and Boyle were likewi&s;e &s;aid to
have previou&s;ly had the art of making it. It was obtained from &s;al microco&s;micum by
evaporation in the form of an acid, but has &s;ince been found in other animal &s;ub&s;tances,
as in the a&s;hes of bones, and even in &s;ome vegetables, as in wheat flour. Keir's chemical
Dict. This pho&s;phoric acid is like all other acids united with vital air, and requires
to be treated with charcoal or phlogi&s;ton to deprive it of this air, it then becomes a kind
of animal &s;ulphur, but of &s;o inflammable a nature, that on the acce&s;s of air it takes fire
&s;pontaneou&s;ly, and as it burns becomes again united with vital air, and re-a&s;&s;umes its
form of pho&s;phoric acid.</P>
<P>As animal re&s;piration &s;eems to be a kind of &s;low combu&s;tion, in which it is probable
that pbo&s;phoric acid is produced by the union of pho&s;phorus with the vital air, &s;o it is
al&s;o probable that pho&s;phoric acid is produced in the excretory or re&s;piratory ve&s;&s;els of
luminous in&s;ects, as the glow-worm and fire-fly, and &s;ome marine in&s;ects. From the
&s;ame principle I &s;uppo&s;e the light from putrid fi&s;h, as from the heads of hadocks, and
from putrid veal, and from rotten wood in a certain &s;tate of their putrefaction, is pro|duced,
and pho&s;phorus thus &s;lowly combined with air is changed into pho&s;phoric acid.
The light from the Bolognian &s;tone, and from calcined &s;hells, and from white paper,
and linen after having been expo&s;ed for a time to the &s;un's light, &s;eem to produce either
the pho&s;phoric or &s;ome other kind of acid from the &s;ulphurous or phlogi&s;tic matter
which they contain. See note on Beccari's &s;hells. l. 180.</P>
<P>There is another proce&s;s &s;eems &s;imilar to this &s;low combu&s;tion, and that is <HI>bleaching.</HI> By the warmth and light of the &s;un the water &s;prinkled upon linen or cotton cloth &s;eems
to be decompo&s;ed, (if we credit the theory of M. Lavoi&s;ier,) and a part of the vital air
thus &s;et at liberty and uncombined and not being in its ela&s;tic form, more ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olves
the colouring or phlogi&s;tic matter of the cloth, and produces a new acid, which is it&s;elf
colourle&s;s, or is wa&s;hed out of the cloth by water. The new proce&s;s of bleaching con|firms
a part of this theory, for by uniting much vital air to marine acid by di&s;tilling it
from mangane&s;e, on dipping the cloth to be bleached in water repleat with this &s;uper|aerated
marine acid, the colouring matter di&s;appears immediately, &s;ooner indeed in cotton
than in linen. See note XXXIV.</P>
<P>There is another proce&s;s which I &s;u&s;pect bears analogy to the&s;e above-mentioned,
and that is the rancidity of animal fat, as of bacon; if bacon be hung up in a warm
kitchen, with much &s;alt adhering on the out&s;ide of it, the fat part of it &s;oon becomes
<PB N="20" REF="249">
yellow and rancid; if it be wa&s;hed with much cold water after it has imbibed the &s;alt,
and ju&s;t before it is hung up, I am well informed, that it will not become rancid, or in
very &s;light degrees. In the former ca&s;e I imagine the &s;alt on the &s;urface of the bacon
attracts water during the cold of the night, which is evaporated during the day, and
that in this evaporation a part of the water becomes decompo&s;ed, as in bleaching, and its
vital air uniting with greater facility in its unela&s;tic &s;tate with the animal fat, produces
an acid, perhaps of the pho&s;phoric kind, which being of a fixed nature lies upon the
bacon, giving it the yellow colour and rancid ta&s;te. It is remarkable that the &s;uper|aerated
marine acid does not bleach living animal &s;ub&s;tances, at lea&s;t it did not whiten a

<P>THE expan&s;ive force of &s;team was known in &s;ome degree to the antients, Hero of
Alexandria de&s;cribes an application of it to produce a rotative motion by the re-action of
&s;team i&s;&s;uing from a &s;phere mounted upon an axis, through two &s;mall tubes bent into

the &s;phere was &s;upplied with &s;team by a pipe communicating with a pan of boiling water,
and entering the &s;phere at one of its poles.</P>
<P>A french writer about the year 1630 de&s;cribes a method of rai&s;ing water to the upper
part of a hou&s;e by filling a chamber with &s;team, and &s;uffering it to conden&s;e of it&s;elf, but
it &s;eems to have been mere theory, as his method was &s;carcely practicable as he de&s;cribes
it. In 1655 the Marquis of Worce&s;ter mentions a method of rai&s;ing water by fire in his
Century of Inventions, but he &s;eems only to have availed him&s;elf of the expan&s;ive force
and not to have known the advantages ari&s;ing from conden&s;ing the &s;team by an injection
of cold water. This latter and mo&s;t important improvement &s;eems to have been made
by Capt. Savery &s;ometime prior to 1698, for in that year his patent for the u&s;e of that
invention was confirmed by act of parliament. This gentleman appears to have been the
fir&s;t who reduced the machine to practice and exhibited it in an u&s;eful form. This
method con&s;i&s;ted only in expelling the air from a ve&s;&s;el by &s;team and conden&s;ing the
&s;team by an injection of cold water, which making a vacuum, the pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo|&s;phere
forced the water to a&s;cend into the &s;team-ve&s;&s;el through a pipe of 24 to 26 feet
<PB N="21" REF="250">
high, and by the admi&s;&s;ion of den&s;e &s;team from the boiler, forcing the water in the &s;team|ve&s;&s;el
to a&s;cend to the height de&s;ired. This con&s;truction was defective becau&s;e it required
very &s;trong ve&s;&s;els to re&s;i&s;t the force of the &s;team, and becau&s;e an enormous quantity of
&s;team was conden&s;ed by coming in contact with the cold water in the &s;team-ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>About or &s;oon after that time M. Papin attempted a &s;team-engine on &s;imilar principles
but rather more defective in its con&s;truction.</P>
<P>The next improvement was made very &s;oon afterwards by Me&s;&s;rs. Newcomen and
Cawley of Dartmouth, it con&s;i&s;ted in employing for the &s;team-ve&s;&s;el a hollow cylinder,
&s;hut at bottom and open at top, furni&s;hed with a pi&s;ton &s;liding ea&s;ily up and down in it,
and made tight by oakum or hemp, and covered with water. This pi&s;ton is &s;u&s;pended
by chains from one end of a beam, moveable upon an axis in the middle of its length,
to the other end of this beam are &s;u&s;pended the pump-rods.</P>
<P>The danger of bur&s;ting the ve&s;&s;els was avoided in this machine, as however high the
water was to be rai&s;ed it was not nece&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e the den&s;ity of the &s;team but only
to enlarge the diameter of the cylinder.</P>
<P>Another advantage was, that the cylinder not being made &s;o cold as in Savary's
method, much le&s;s &s;team was lo&s;t in filling it after each conden&s;ation.</P>
<P>The machine however &s;till remained imperfect, for the cold water thrown into the
cylinder acquired heat from the &s;team it conden&s;ed, and being in a ve&s;&s;el exhau&s;ted of
air it produced &s;team it&s;elf, which in part re&s;i&s;ted the action of the atmo&s;phere on the
pi&s;ton; were this remedied by throwing in more cold water the de&s;truction of &s;team in
the next filling of the cylinder would be proportionally increa&s;ed. It has therefore in
practice been found advi&s;eable not to load the&s;e engines with columns of water weighing
more than &s;even pounds for each &s;quare inch of the area of the pi&s;ton. The bulk of
water when converted into &s;team remained unknown until Mr. J. Watt, then of
Gla&s;gow, in 1764, determined it to be about 1800 times more rare than water. It &s;oon
occurred to Mr. Watt that a perfect engine would be that in which no &s;team &s;hould be
conden&s;ed in filling the cylinder, and in which the &s;team &s;hould be &s;o perfectly cooled as
to produce nearly a perfect vacuum.</P>
<P>Mr. Watt having a&s;certained the degree of heat in which water boiled in vacuo, and
under progre&s;&s;ive degrees of pre&s;&s;ure, and in&s;tructed by Dr. Black's di&s;covery of latent
heat, having calculated the quantity of cold water nece&s;&s;ary to conden&s;e certain quantities
of &s;team &s;o far as to produce the exhau&s;tion required, he made a communication from
the cylinder to a cold ve&s;&s;el previou&s;ly exhau&s;ted of air and water, into which the &s;team
ru&s;hed by its ela&s;ticity, and became immediately conden&s;ed. He then adapted a cover to
the cylinder and admitted &s;team above the pi&s;ton to pre&s;s it down in&s;tead of air, and
in&s;tead of applying water he u&s;ed oil or grea&s;e to fill the pores of the oakum and to lubri|cate
the cylinder.</P>
<P>He next applied a pump to extract the injection water, the conden&s;ed &s;team, and the
air, from the conden&s;ing ve&s;&s;el, every &s;troke of the engine.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="251">
To prevent the cooling of the cylinder by the contact of the external air, he &s;ur|rounded
it with a ca&s;e containing &s;team, which he again protected by a covering of
matters which conduct heat &s;lowly.</P>
<P>This con&s;truction pre&s;ented an ea&s;y means of regulating the power of the engine, for
the &s;team being the acting power, as the pipe which admits it from the boiler is more
or le&s;s opened, a greater or &s;maller quantity can enter during the time of a &s;troke, and
con&s;equently the engine can act with exactly the nece&s;&s;ary degree of energy.</P>
<P>Mr. Watt gained a patent for his engine in 1768, but the further per&s;ecution of his
de&s;igns were delayed by other avocations till 1775, when in conjunction with Mr. Boulton
of Soho near Birmingham, numerous experiments were made on a large &s;cale by their
united ingenuity, and great improvements added to the machinery, and an act of parlia|ment
obtained for the prolongation of their patent for twenty-five years, they have &s;ince
that time drained many of the deep mines in Cornwall, which but for the happy union
of &s;uch genius mu&s;t immediately have cea&s;ed to work. One of the&s;e engines works a
pump of eighteen inches diameter, and upwards of 100 fathom or 600 feet high, at the
rate of ten to twelve &s;trokes of &s;even feet long each, in a minute, and that with one fifth
part of the coals which a common engine would have taken to do the &s;ame work. The
power of this engine may be ea&s;ier comprehended by &s;aying that it rai&s;ed a weight equal
to 81000 pounds 80 feet high in a minute, which is equal to the combined action of 200
good hor&s;es. In Newcomen's engine this would have required a cylinder of the
enormous diameter of 120 inches or ten feet, but as in this engine of Mr. Watt and
Mr. Boulton the &s;team acts, and a vacuum is made, alternately above and below the
pi&s;ton, the power exerted is double to what the &s;ame cylinder would otherways pro|duce,
and is further augmented by an inequality in the length of the two ends of the
lever.</P>
<P>The&s;e gentlemen have al&s;o by other contrivances applied their engines to the turning
of mills for almo&s;t every purpo&s;e, of which that great pile of machinery the Albion
Mill is a well known in&s;tance. Forges, &s;litting mills, and other great works are erected
where nature has furni&s;hed no running water, and future times may boa&s;t that this
grand and u&s;eful engine was invented and perfected in our own country.</P>
<P>Since the above article went to the pre&s;s the Albion Mill is no more; it is &s;uppo&s;ed
to have been &s;et on fire by intere&s;ted or malicious incendaries, and is burnt to the
ground. Whence London has lo&s;t the credit and the advantage of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the
mo&s;t powerful machine in the world!</P>

<Q><L>In phalanx firm the fiend of Fro&s;t a&s;&s;ail. </L><BIBL>CANTO I. l. 446.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE cau&s;e of the expan&s;ion of water during its conver&s;ion into ice is not yet well
a&s;certained, it was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been owing to the air being &s;et at liberty in the act
of congelation which was before di&s;&s;olved in the water, and the many air bubbles in ice
were thought to countenance this opinion. But the great force with which ice expands
during its congelation, &s;o as to bur&s;t iron bombs and coehorns, according to the experi|ments
of Major Williams at Quebec, invalidates this idea of the cau&s;e of it, and may
&s;ometime be brought into u&s;e as a means of breaking rocks in mining, or projecting
cannon-balls, or for other mechanical purpo&s;es, if the means of producing congelation
&s;hould ever be di&s;covered to be as ea&s;y as the means of producing combu&s;tion.</P>
<P>Mr. de Mairan attributes the increa&s;e of bulk of frozen water to the different arrange|ment
of the particles of it in cry&s;tallization, as they are con&s;tantly joined at an angle of
60 degrees; and mu&s;t by this di&s;po&s;ition he thinks occupy a greater volume than if they
were parallel. He found the augmentation of the water during freezing to amount to
one-fourteenth, one-eighteenth, one-nineteenth, and when the water was previou&s;ly
purged of air to only one-twenty-&s;econd part. He adds that a piece of ice, which was
at fir&s;t only one-fourteenth part &s;pecifically lighter than water, on being expo&s;ed &s;ome
days to the fro&s;t became one-twelfth lighter than water. Hence he thinks ice by being
expo&s;ed to greater cold &s;till increa&s;es in volume, and to this attributes the bur&s;ting of ice
in ponds and on the glaciers. See Lewis's Commerce of Arts, p. 257. and the note on
Mu&s;chus in the other volume of this work.</P>
<P>This expan&s;ion of ice well accounts for the greater mi&s;chief done by vernal fro&s;ts at|tended
with moi&s;ture, (as by hoar-fro&s;ts,) than by the dry fro&s;ts called black fro&s;ts. Mr.
Lawrence in a letter to Mr. Bradley complains that the dale-mi&s;t attended with a fro&s;t on
may-day had de&s;troyed all his tender fruits; though there was a &s;harper fro&s;t the night
before without a mi&s;t, that did him no injury; and adds, that a garden not a &s;tone's
throw from his own on a higher &s;ituation, being above the dale-mi&s;t, had received no
damage. Bradley, Vol. II. p. 232.</P>
<P>Mr. Hunter by very curious experiments di&s;covered that the living principle in fi&s;h,
in vegetables, and even in eggs and &s;eeds, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a power of re&s;i&s;ting congelation.
Phil. Tran&s;. There can be no doubt but that the exertions of animals to avoid
the pain of cold may produce in them a greater quantity of heat, at lea&s;t for a time,
but that vegetables, eggs, or &s;eeds, &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch a quality is truly wonderful.
Others have imagined that animals po&s;&s;e&s;s a power of preventing them&s;elves from becom|ing
much warmer than 98 degrees of heat, when immer&s;ed in an atmo&s;phere above that
degree of heat. It is true that the increa&s;ed exhalation from their bodies will in &s;ome
mea&s;ure cool them, as much heat is carried off by the evaporation of fluids, but this
is a chemical not an animal proce&s;s. The experiments made by tho&s;e who continued
<PB N="24" REF="253">
many minutes in the air of a room heated &s;o much above any natural atmo&s;pheric heat,
do not &s;eem conclu&s;ive, as they remained in it a le&s;s time than would have been neces|&s;ary
to have heated a ma&s;s of beef of the &s;ame magnitude, and the circulation of the blood
in living animals, by perpetually bringing new &s;upplies of fluid to the &s;kin, would prevent
the external &s;urface from becoming hot much &s;ooner than the whole ma&s;s. And thirdly,
there appears no power of animal bodies to produce cold in di&s;ea&s;es, as in &s;carlet fever, in
which the increa&s;ed action of the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin produces heat and contributes to ex|hau&s;t
the animal power already too much weakened.</P>
<P>It has been thought by many that fro&s;ts meliorate the ground, and that they are in
general &s;alubrious to mankind. In re&s;pect to the former it is now well known that ice or
&s;now contain no nitrous particles, and though fro&s;t by enlarging the bulk of moi&s;t clay
leaves it &s;ofter for a time after the thaw, yet as &s;oon as the water exhales, the clay becomes
as hard as before, being pre&s;&s;ed together by the incumbent atmo&s;phere, and by its &s;elf|attraction,
called <HI>&s;etting</HI> by the potters. Add to this that on the coa&s;ts of Africa, where
fro&s;t is unknown, the fertility of the &s;oil is almo&s;t beyond our conceptions of it. In
re&s;pect to the general &s;alubrity of fro&s;ty &s;ea&s;ons the bills of mortality are an evidence in
the negative, as in long fro&s;ts many weakly and old people peri&s;h from debility occa&s;ioned
by the cold, and many cla&s;&s;es of birds and other wild animals are benumbed by the cold
or de&s;troyed by the con&s;equent &s;carcity of food, and many tender vegetables peri&s;h from
the degree of cold.</P>
<P>I do not think it &s;hould be objected to this doctrine that there are moi&s;t days attended
with a bri&s;k cold wind when no vi&s;ible ice appears, and which are yet more di&s;agreeable
and de&s;tructive than fro&s;ty weather. For on the&s;e days the cold moi&s;ture, which is de|po&s;ited
on the &s;kin is there evaporated and thus produces a degree of cold perhaps greater
than the milder fro&s;ts. Whence even in &s;uch days both the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations and
in&s;alubrious effects belong to the cau&s;e abovementioned, viz. the inten&s;ity of the cold.
Add to this that in the&s;e cold moi&s;t days as we pa&s;s along or as the wind blows upon us,
a new &s;heet of cold water is as it were perpetually applied to us and hangs upon our
bodies, now as water is 800 times den&s;er than air and is a much better conductor of heat,
we are &s;tarved with cold like tho&s;e who go into a cold bath, both by the great number of
particles in contact with the &s;kin and their greater facility of receiving our heat.</P>
<P>It may neverthele&s;s be true that &s;nows of long duration in our winters may be le&s;s in|jurious
to vegetation than great rains and &s;horter fro&s;ts, for two rea&s;ons. 1. Becau&s;e great
rains carry down many thou&s;and pounds worth of the be&s;t part of the manure off the lands
into the &s;ea, whereas &s;now di&s;&s;olves more gradually and thence carries away le&s;s from the
land; any one may di&s;tingui&s;h a &s;now-flood from a rain-flood by the tran&s;parency of the
water. Hence hills or fields with con&s;iderable inclination of &s;urface &s;hould be ploughed
horizontally that the furrows may &s;tay the water from &s;howers till it depo&s;its its mud.
2. Snow protects vegetables from the &s;everity of the fro&s;t, &s;ince it is always in a &s;tate of
thaw where it is in contact with the earth; as the earth's heat is about 48&deg; and the heat of
thawing &s;now is 32&deg; the vegetables between them are kept in a degree of heat about 40,
by which many of them are pre&s;erved. See note on Mu&s;chus, Vol. II. of this work.</P>

<HEAD>ELECTRIC POINTS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was an idle di&s;pute whether knobs or points were preferable on the top of
conductors for the defence of hou&s;es. The de&s;ign of the&s;e conductors is to permit the
electric matter accumulated in the clouds to pa&s;s through them into the earth in a &s;maller
continued &s;tream as the cloud approaches, before it comes to what is termed &s;triking
di&s;tance; now as it is well known that accumulated electricity will pa&s;s to points at a
much greater di&s;tance than it will to knobs there can be no doubt of their preference;
and it would &s;eem that the finer the point and the le&s;s liable to become ru&s;ty the better,
as it would take off the lightening while it was &s;till at a greater di&s;tance, and by that
means pre&s;erve a greater extent of building; the very extremity of the point &s;hould be of
pure &s;ilver or gold, and might be branched into a kind of bru&s;h, &s;ince one &s;mall point can
not be &s;uppo&s;ed to receive &s;o great a quantity as a thicker bar might conduct into the
earth.</P>
<P>If an in&s;ulated metallic ball is armed with a point, like a needle, projecting from one
part of it, the electric fluid will be &s;een in the dark to pa&s;s off from this point, &s;o long as
the ball is kept &s;upplied with electricity. The rea&s;on of this is not difficult to comprehend,
every part of the electric atmo&s;phere which &s;urrounds the in&s;ulated ball is attracted to
that ball by a large &s;urface of it, whereas the electric atmo&s;phere which is near the ex|tremity
of the needle is attracted to it by only a &s;ingle point, in con&s;equence the particles
of electric matter near the &s;urface of the ball approach towards it and pu&s;h off by their
greater gravitation the particles of electric matter over the point of the needle in a con|tinued
&s;tream.</P>
<P>Something like this happens in re&s;pect to the diffu&s;ion of oil on water from a pointed
cork, an experiment which was many years ago &s;hewn me by Dr. Franklin; he cut a
piece of cork about the &s;ize of a letter-wafer and left on one edge of it a point about a
&s;ixth of an inch in length projecting as a tangent to the circumference. This was dipped
in oil and thrown on a pond of water and continued to revolve as the oil left the point
for a great many minutes. The oil de&s;cends from the floating cork upon the water
being diffu&s;ed upon it without friction and perhaps without contact; but its going off at
the point &s;o forcibly as to make the cork revolve in a contrary direction &s;eems analogous
to the departure of the electric fluid from points.</P>
<P>Can any thing &s;imilar to either of the&s;e happen in re&s;pect to the earth's atmo&s;phere

<HEAD>FAIRY-RINGS.</HEAD>
<P>There is a phenomenon &s;uppo&s;ed to be electric which is yet unaccounted for, I
mean the Fairy-rings, as they are called, &s;o often &s;een on the gra&s;s. The numerous
fla&s;hes of lightning which occur every &s;ummer are, I believe, generally di&s;charged on
the earth, and but &s;eldom (if ever) from one cloud to another. Moi&s;t trees are the
mo&s;t frequent conductors of the&s;e fla&s;hes of lightning, and I am informed by purcha&s;ers
of wood that innumerable trees are thus cracked and injured. At other times larger
parts or prominences of clouds gradually &s;inking as they move along, are di&s;charged on
the moi&s;ture parts of gra&s;&s;y plains. Now this knob or corner of a cloud in being
attracted by the earth will become nearly cylindrical, as loo&s;e wool would do when
drawn out into a thread, and will &s;trike the earth with a &s;tream of electricity perhaps
two or ten yards in diameter. Now as a &s;tream of electricity di&s;places the air it pa&s;&s;es
through, it is plain no part of the gra&s;s can be burnt by it, but ju&s;t the external ring of
this cylinder where the gra&s;s can have acce&s;s to the air, &s;ince without air nothing can be
calcined. This earth after having been &s;o calcined becomes a richer &s;oil, and either fun|gu&s;es
or a bluer gra&s;s for many years mark the place. That lightning di&s;places the air in
its pa&s;&s;age is evinced by the loud crack that &s;ucceeds it, which is owing to the &s;ides of the
aerial vacuum clapping together when the lightning is withdrawn. That nothing will
calcine without air is now well under&s;tood from the acids produced in the burning of
phlogi&s;tic &s;ub&s;tances, and may be agreeably &s;een by &s;u&s;pending a paper on an iron prong
and putting it into the centre of the blaze of an iron-furnace; it may be held there
&s;ome &s;econds and may be again withdrawn without its being burnt, if it be pa&s;&s;ed
quickly into the flame and out again through the external part of it which is in contact
with the air. I know &s;ome circles of many yards diameter of this kind near Foremark
in Derby&s;hire which annually produce large white fungu&s;es and &s;tronger gra&s;s, and
have done &s;o, I am informed, above thirty years. This increa&s;ed fertility of the ground
by calcination or charring, and its continuing to operate &s;o many years is well worth the
attention of the farmer, and &s;hews the u&s;e of paring and burning new turf in agri|culture,
which produces its effect not &s;o much by the a&s;hes of the vegetable fibres as by
charring the &s;oil which adheres to them.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ituations, whether from eminence or from moi&s;ture, which were proper once
to attract and di&s;charge a thunder-cloud, are more liable again to experience the &s;ame.
Hence many fairy-rings are often &s;een near each other either without inter&s;ecting each
other, as I &s;aw this &s;ummer in a garden in Nottingham&s;hire, or inter&s;ecting each other

<HEAD>NOTE XIV.&mdash;BUDS AND BULBS.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Where dwell my vegetative realms benumb'd</L>
<L>In buds impri&s;on'd, or in bulbs intomb'd. </L><BIBL>CANTO I. l. 465.</BIBL></Q>
<P>A TREE is properly &s;peaking a family or &s;warm of buds, each bud being an in|dividual
plant, for if one of the&s;e buds be torn or cut out and planted in the earth with
a gla&s;s cup inverted over it to prevent its exhalation from being at fir&s;t greater than its
power of ab&s;orption, it will produce a tree &s;imilar to its parent; each bud has a leaf,
which is its lungs, appropriated to it, and the bark of the tree is a congeries of the roots
of the&s;e individual buds, whence old hollow trees are often &s;een to have &s;ome branches
flouri&s;h with vigour after the internal wood is almo&s;t intirely decayed and vani&s;hed.
According to this idea Linneus has ob&s;erved that trees and &s;hrubs are roots above
ground, for if a tree be inverted leaves will grow from the root-part and roots from the
trunk-part. Phil. Bot. p. 39. Hence it appears that vegetables have two methods of pro|pagating
them&s;elves, the oviparous as by &s;eeds, and the viviparous as by their buds and
bulbs, and that the individual plants, whether from &s;eeds or buds or bulbs, are all annual
productions like many kinds of in&s;ects as the &s;ilk-worm, the parent peri&s;hing in the
autumn after having produced an embryon, which lies in a torpid &s;tate during the winter,
and is matured in the &s;ucceeding &s;ummer. Hence Linneus names buds and bulbs the
winter-cradles of the plant or hybernacula, and might have given the &s;ame term to
&s;eeds. In warm climates few plants produce buds, as the vegetable life can be com|pleated
in one &s;ummer, and hence the hybernacle is not wanted; in cold climates al&s;o
&s;ome plants do not produce buds, as philadelphus, &s;rangula, viburnum, ivy, heath,
wood-night&s;hade, rue, geranium.</P>
<P>The bulbs of plants are another kind of winter-cradle, or hybernacle, adhering to
the de&s;cending trunk, and are found in the perennial herbaceous plants which are too
tender to bear the cold of the winter. The production of the&s;e &s;ubterraneous winter
lodges, is not yet perhaps clearly under&s;tood, they have been di&s;tributed by Linneus
according to their forms into &s;caly, &s;olid, coated, and jointed bulbs, which however
does not elucidate their manner of production. As the buds of trees may be truly
e&s;teemed individual annual plants, their roots con&s;tituting the bark of the tree, it follows
that the&s;e roots (viz. of each individual bud) &s;pread them&s;elves over the la&s;t years bark,
making a new bark over the old one, and thence de&s;cending cover with a new bark the
old roots al&s;o in the &s;ame manner. A &s;imilar circum&s;tance I &s;uppo&s;e to happen in
&s;ome herbaceous plants, that is, a new bark is annually produced over the old root, and
thus for &s;ome years at lea&s;t the old root or caudex increa&s;es in &s;ize and puts up new
&s;tems. As the&s;e roots increa&s;e in &s;ize the central part I &s;uppo&s;e changes like the in|ternal
wood of a tree and does not po&s;&s;e&s;s any vegetable life, and therefore gives out no
fibres or rootlets, and hence appears bitten off, as in valerian, plantain, and devil's-bit.
And this decay of the central part of the root I &s;uppo&s;e has given occa&s;ion to the belief
of the root-fibres drawing down the bulb &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on by Mr. Milne in his
Botanical Dictionary, Art. Bulb.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="257">
From the ob&s;ervations and drawings of various kinds of bulbous roots at different
times of their growth, &s;ent me by a young lady of nice ob&s;ervation, it appears probable
that all bulbous roots properly &s;o called peri&s;h annually in this climate: Bradley, Miller,
and the Author of Spectacle de la Nature, ob&s;erve that the tulip annually renews its
bulb, for the &s;talk of the old flower is found under the old dry coat but on the out&s;ide

other &s;mall new bulbs produced between the coats of this large one but from the

weeks intirely decayed; on di&s;&s;ecting this mon&s;ter, the middle de&s;cending bulb was found
by its proce&s;s to adhere to the caudex and to the old flower-&s;tem, and the &s;ide ones
were &s;eparated from the flower-&s;tem by a few &s;hrivelled coats but adhered to the caudex.
Whence &s;he concludes that the&s;e la&s;t were off-&s;ets or leaf-bulbs which &s;hould have been
&s;een between the coats of the new flower-bulb if it had been left to grow in the earth,
and that the middle one would have been the new flower-bulb. In &s;ome years (perhaps
in wet &s;ea&s;ons) the flori&s;ts are &s;aid to lo&s;e many of their tulip-roots by a &s;imilar proce&s;s,
the new leaf-bulbs being produced beneath the old ones by an elongation of the caudex
without any new flower-bulbs.</P>
<P>By repeated di&s;&s;ections &s;he ob&s;erves that the leaf-bulbs or off-&s;ets of tulip, crocus,
gladiolus, fritillary, are renewed in the &s;ame manner as the flowering-bulbs, contrary to
the opinion of many writers; this new leaf-bulb is formed on the in&s;ide of the coats
from whence the leaves grow, and is more or le&s;s advanced in &s;ize as the outer coats and
leaves are more or le&s;s &s;hrivelled. In examining tulip, iris, hyacinth, hare-bell, the new
bulb was invariably found <HI>between</HI> the flower-&s;tem and the ba&s;e of the innermo&s;t leaf of
tho&s;e roots which had flowered, and <HI>inclo&s;ed by</HI> the ba&s;e of the innermo&s;t leaf in tho&s;e
roots which had not flowered, in both ca&s;es adhering to the caudex or fle&s;hy circle from
which the root-fibres &s;pring.</P>
<P>Hence it is probable that the bulbs of hyacinths are renewed annually, but that this
is performed from the caudex within the old bulb, the outer coat of which does not &s;o
&s;hrivel as in crocus and fritillary and hence this change is not &s;o apparent. But I
believe as &s;oon as the flower is advanced the new bulbs may be &s;een on di&s;&s;ection, nor
does the annual increa&s;e of the &s;ize of the root of cyclamen and of aletris capen&s;is mili|tate
again&s;t this annual renewal of them, &s;ince the leaf-bulbs or off-&s;ets, as de&s;cribed
above, are increa&s;ed in &s;ize as they are annually renewed. See note on orchis, and on
anthoxanthum, in Vol. II. of this work.</P>

<Q><L>From the deep craters of his realms of fire</L>
<L>The whirling &s;un this ponderous planet hurld. </L><BIBL>CANTO II. l. 14.</BIBL></Q>
<P>DR. ALEXANDER WILSON, Profe&s;&s;or of A&s;tronomy at Gla&s;gow, publi&s;hed
a paper in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions for 1774, demon&s;trating that the &s;pots in the
&s;un's di&s;k are real cavities, excavations through the luminous material, which covers the
other parts of the &s;un's &s;urface. One of the&s;e cavities he found to be about 4000 miles
deep and many times as wide. Some objections were made to this doctrine by M. De
la Laude in the Memoirs of the French Academy for the year 1776, which however
have been ably an&s;wered by Profe&s;&s;or Wil&s;on in reply in the Philo&s;. Tran&s;, for 1783.
Keil ob&s;erves, in his A&s;tronomical Lectures, p. 44, <Q>We frequently &s;ee &s;pots in the
&s;un which are larger and broader not only than Europe or Africa, but which even equal,
if they do not exceed, the &s;urface of the whole terraqueous globe.</Q> Now that the&s;e
cavities are made in the &s;un's body by a proce&s;s of nature &s;imilar to our earthquakes
does not &s;eem improbable on &s;everal accounts. 1. Becau&s;e from this di&s;covery of Dr.
Wil&s;on it appears that the internal parts of the &s;un are not in a &s;tate of inflammation or
of ejecting light, like the external part or luminous ocean which covers it; and hence
that a greater degree of heat or inflammation and con&s;equent expan&s;ion or explo&s;ion
may occa&s;ionally be produced in its internal or dark nucleus. 2. Becau&s;e the &s;olar &s;pots
or cavities are frequently increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed in &s;ize. 3. New ones are often pro|duced.
4. And old ones vani&s;h. 5. Becau&s;e there are brighter or more luminous parts
of the &s;un's di&s;k, called faculae by Scheiner and Hevelius, which would &s;eem to be vol|canos
in the &s;un, or, as Dr. Wil&s;on calls them, <Q>eructations of matter more luminous
than that which covers the &s;un's &s;urface.</Q> 6. To which may be added that all the
planets added together with their &s;atellites do not amount to more than one &s;ix hundred
and fiftieth part of the ma&s;s of the &s;un according to Sir I&s;aac Newton.</P>
<P>Now if it could be &s;uppo&s;ed that the planets were originally thrown out of the &s;un
by larger &s;un-quakes than tho&s;e frequent ones which occa&s;ion the&s;e &s;pots or excavations
above-mentioned, what would happen? I. According to the ob&s;ervations and opinion
of Mr. Her&s;chel the &s;un it&s;elf and all its planets are moving forwards round &s;ome other
centre with an unknown velocity, which may be of opake matter corre&s;ponding with the
very antient and general idea of a chaos. Whence if a ponderous planet, as Saturn,
could be &s;uppo&s;ed to be projected from the &s;un by an explo&s;ion, the motion of the &s;un
it&s;elf might be at the &s;ame time di&s;turbed in &s;uch a manner as to prevent the planet
from falling again into it. 2. As the &s;un revolves round its own axis its form mu&s;t
be that of an oblate &s;pheroid like the earth, and therefore a body projected from its
&s;urface perpendicularly upwards from that &s;urface would not ri&s;e perpendicularly from
the &s;un's centre, unle&s;s it happened to be projected exactly from either of its poles or
<PB N="30" REF="259">
from its equator. Whence it may not be nece&s;&s;ary that a planet if thus projected from
the &s;un by explo&s;ion &s;hould again fall into the &s;un. 3. They would part from the &s;un's
&s;urface with the velocity with which that &s;urface was moving, and with the velocity
acquired by the explo&s;ion, and would therefore move round the &s;un in the &s;ame direction
in which the &s;un rotates on its axis, and perform eliptic orbits. 4. All the planets would
move the &s;ame way round the &s;un, from this fir&s;t motion acquired at leaving its &s;urface,
but their orbits would be inclined to each other according to the di&s;tance of the part,
where they were thrown out, from the &s;un's equator. Hence tho&s;e which were ejected
near the &s;un's equator would have orbits but little inclined to each other, as the primary
planets; the plain of all who&s;e orbits are inclined but &s;even degrees and a half from each
other. Others which were ejected near the &s;un's poles would have much more eccentric
orbits, as they would partake &s;o much le&s;s of the &s;un's rotatory motion at the time they
parted from his &s;urface, and would therefore be carried further from the &s;un by the
velocity they had gained by the explo&s;ion which ejected them, and become comets.
5. They would all obey the &s;ame laws of motion in their revolutions round the &s;un;
this has been determined by a&s;tronomers, who have demon&s;trated that they move through
equal areas in equal times. 6. As their annual periods would depend on the height they
ro&s;e by the explo&s;ion, the&s;e would differ in them all. 7. As their diurnal revolutions
would depend on one &s;ide of the exploded matter adhering more than the other at the
time it was torn off by the explo&s;ion, the&s;e would al&s;o differ in the different planets, and
not bear any proportion to their annual periods. Now as all the&s;e circum&s;tances coincide
with the known laws of the planetary &s;y&s;tem, they &s;erve to &s;trengthen this conjecture.</P>
<P>This coincidence of &s;uch a variety of circum&s;tances induced M. de Buffon to &s;uppo&s;e
that the planets were all &s;truck off from the &s;un's &s;urface by the impact of a large comet,
&s;uch as approached &s;o near the &s;un's di&s;k, and with &s;uch amazing velocity, in the year
1680, and is expected to return in 2255. But Mr. Buffon did not recollect that the&s;e
comets them&s;elves are only planets with more eccentric orbits, and that therefore it mu&s;t
be a&s;ked, what had previou&s;ly &s;truck off the&s;e comets from the &s;un's body? 2. That if
all the&s;e planets were &s;truck off from the &s;un at the &s;ame time, they mu&s;t have been &s;o
near as to have attracted each other and have formed one ma&s;s: 3. That we &s;hall want
new cau&s;es for &s;eparating the &s;econdary planets from the primary ones, and mu&s;t there|fore
look out for &s;ome other agent, as it does not appear how the impul&s;e of a comet
could have made one planet roll round another at the time they both of them were
driven off from the &s;urface of the &s;un.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be a&s;ked, why new planets are not frequently ejected from the &s;un? it
may be an&s;wered, that after many large earthquakes many vents are left for the ela&s;tic
vapours to e&s;cape, and hence, by the pre&s;ent appearance of the &s;urface of our earth,
earthquakes prodigiou&s;ly larger than any recorded in hi&s;tory have exi&s;ted; the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances
may have affected the &s;un, on who&s;e &s;urface there are appearances of vol|canos,
as de&s;cribed above. Add to this, that &s;ome of the comets, and even the georgium
&s;idus, may, for ought we know to the contrary, have been emitted from the &s;un in more
<PB N="31" REF="260">
modern days, and have been diverted from their cour&s;e, and thus prevented from re|turning
into the &s;un, by their approach to &s;ome of the older planets, which is &s;omewhat
countenanced by the opinion &s;everal philo&s;ophers have maintained, that the quantity of
matter of the &s;un has decrea&s;ed. Dr. Halley ob&s;erved, that by comparing the proportion
which the periodical time of the moon bore to that of the &s;un in former times, with the
proportion between them at pre&s;ent, that the moon is found to be &s;omewhat accelerated
in re&s;pect to the &s;un. Pemberton's View of Sir I&s;aac Newton, p. 247. And &s;o large is
the body of this mighty luminary, that all the planets thus thrown out of it would make
&s;carcely any perceptible diminution of it, as mentioned above. The cavity mentioned
above, as mea&s;ured by Dr. Wil&s;on of 4000 miles in depth, not penetrating an hundredth
part of the &s;un's &s;emi-diameter; and yet, as its width was many times greater than its
depth, was large enough to contain a greater body than our terre&s;trial world.</P>
<P>I do not mean to conceal, that from the laws of gravity unfolded by Sir I&s;aac Newton,
&s;uppo&s;ing the &s;un to be a &s;phere and to have no progre&s;&s;ive motion, and not liable it&s;elf
to be di&s;turbed by the &s;uppo&s;ed projection of the planets from it, that &s;uch planets mu&s;t
return into the &s;un. The late Rev. William Ludlam, of Leice&s;ter, who&s;e genius never
met with reward equal to its merits, in a letter to me, dated January, 1787, after having
&s;hewn, as mentioned above, that planets &s;o projected from the &s;un would return to it,
adds, <Q>That a body as large as the moon &s;o projected, would di&s;turb the motion of the
earth in its orbit, is certain; but the calculation of &s;uch di&s;turbing forces is difficult.
The body in &s;ome circum&s;tances might become a &s;atellite, and both move round their
common centre of gravity, and that centre be carried in an annual orbit round the
&s;un.</Q></P>
<P>There are other circum&s;tances which might have concurred at the time of &s;uch &s;up|po&s;ed
explo&s;ions, which would render this idea not impo&s;&s;ible. I. The planets might be
thrown out of the &s;un at the time the &s;un it&s;elf was ri&s;ing from chaos, and be attracted
by other &s;uns in their vicinity ri&s;ing at the &s;ame time out of chaos, which would prevent
them from returning into the &s;un. 2. The new planet in its cour&s;e or a&s;cent from the &s;un,
might explode and eject a &s;atellite, or perhaps more than one, and thus by its cour&s;e
being affected might not return into the &s;un. 3. If more planets were ejected at the
&s;ame time from the &s;un, they might attract and di&s;turb each others cour&s;e at the time
they left the body of the &s;un, or very &s;oon afterwards, when they would be &s;o much
nearer each other.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XVI.&mdash;CALCAREOUS EARTH.</HEAD>
<Q><L>While Ocean wrap'd it in his azure robe.</L> <BIBL>CANTO II. 1. 34.</BIBL></Q>
<P>FROM having ob&s;erved that many of the highe&s;t mountains of the world con&s;i&s;t of
lime-&s;tone replete with &s;hells, and that the&s;e mountains bear the marks of having been
lifted up by &s;ubterraneous fires from the interior parts of the globe; and as lime-&s;tone
replete with &s;hells is found at the bottom of many of our deepe&s;t mines &s;ome philo|&s;ophers
have concluded that the nucleus of the earth was for many ages covered with
water which was peopled with its adapted animals; that the &s;hells and bones of the&s;e
animals in a long &s;eries of time produced &s;olid &s;trata in the ocean &s;urrounding the ori|ginal
nucleus.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;trata con&s;i&s;t of the accumulated exuviae of &s;hell-fi&s;h, the animals peri&s;hed
age after age but their &s;hells remained, and in progre&s;&s;ion of time produced the amazing
quantities of lime-&s;tone which almo&s;t cover the earth. Other marine animals called
coralloids rai&s;ed walls and even mountains by the congeries of their calcareous habita|tions,
the&s;e perpendicular corralline rocks make &s;ome parts of the Southern Ocean highly
dangerous, as appears in the journals of Capt. Cook. From contemplating the immen&s;e
&s;trata of lime-&s;tone, both in re&s;pect to their extent and thickne&s;s, formed from the&s;e
&s;hells of animals, philo&s;ophers have been led to conclude that much of the water of the
&s;ea has been converted into calcareous earth by pa&s;&s;ing through their organs of dige&s;tion.
The formation of calcareous earth &s;eems more particularly to be an animal proce&s;s as the
formation of clay belongs to the vegetable economy; thus the &s;hells of crabs and other
te&s;taceous fi&s;h are annually reproduced from the mucous membrane beneath them; the
&s;hells of eggs are fir&s;t a mucous membrane, and the calculi of the kidneys and tho&s;e
found in all other parts of our &s;y&s;tem which &s;ometimes contain calcareous earth, &s;eem
to originate from inflamed membranes; the bones them&s;elves con&s;i&s;t of calcareous earth
united with the pho&s;phoric or animal acid, which may be &s;eparated by di&s;&s;olving the
a&s;hes of calcined bones in the nitrous acid; the various &s;ecretions of animals, as their
&s;aliva and urine, abound likewi&s;e with calcareous earth, as appears by the incru&s;tations
about the teeth and the &s;ediments of urine. It is probable that animal mucus is a pre|vious
proce&s;s towards the formation of calcareous earth; and that all the calcareous
earth in the world which is &s;een in lime-&s;tones, marbles, &s;pars, alaba&s;ters, marls, (which
make up the greate&s;t part of the earth's cru&s;t, as far as it has yet been penetrated,) have
been formed originally by animal and vegetable bodies from the ma&s;s of water, and that
by the&s;e means the &s;olid part of the terraqueous globe has perpetually been in an
increa&s;ing &s;tate and the water perpetually in a decrea&s;ing one.</P>
<P>After the mountains of &s;hells and other recrements of aquatic animals were elevated
above the water the upper heaps of them were gradually di&s;&s;olved by rains and dews
and oozing through were either perfectly cry&s;tallized in &s;maller cavities and formed
<PB N="33" REF="262">
calcareous &s;par, or were imperfectly cry&s;tallized on the roofs of larger cavities and pro|duced
&s;talactites; or mixing with other undi&s;&s;olved &s;hells beneath them formed marbles,
which were more or le&s;s cry&s;tallized and more or le&s;s pure; or la&s;tly, after being di&s;&s;olved,
the water was exhaled from them in &s;uch a manner that the external parts became &s;olid,
and forming an arch prevented the internal parts from approaching each other &s;o near as
to become &s;olid, and thus chalk was produced. I have &s;pecimens of chalk formed at the
root of &s;everal &s;talactites, and in their central parts; and of other &s;talactites which are
hollow like quills from a &s;imilar cau&s;e, viz. from the external part of the &s;talactite harden|ing
fir&s;t by its evaporation, and thus either attracting the internal di&s;&s;olved particles to
the cru&s;t, or preventing them from approaching each other &s;o as to form a &s;olid body.
Of the&s;e I &s;aw many hanging from the arched roof of a cellar under the high &s;treet in
Edinburgh.</P>
<P>If this di&s;&s;olved lime&s;tone met with vitriolic acid it was converted into alaba&s;ter,
parting at the &s;ame time with its fixable air. If it met with the fluor acid it became fluor;
if with the &s;iliceous acid, flint; and when mixed with clay and &s;and, or either of them,
acquires the name of marl. And under one or other of the&s;e forms compo&s;es a great
part of the &s;olid globe of the earth.</P>
<P>Another mode in which lime&s;tone appears is in the form of round granulated par|ticles,
but &s;lightly cohering together; of this kind a bed extends over Lincoln heath,
perhaps twenty miles long by ten wide. The form of this calcareous &s;and, its angles
having been rubbed off, and the flatne&s;s of its bed, evinces that that part of the country
was &s;o formed under water, the particles of &s;and having thus been rounded, like all other
rounded pebbles. This round form of calcareous &s;and and of other larger pebbles is
produced under water, partly by their being more or le&s;s &s;oluble in water, and hence the
angular parts become di&s;&s;olved, fir&s;t, by their expo&s;ing a larger &s;urface to the action of the
men&s;truum, and &s;econdly, from their attrition again&s;t each other by the &s;treams or tides,
for a great length of time, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively as they were collected, and perhaps when &s;ome of
them had not acquired their harde&s;t &s;tate.</P>
<P>This calcareous &s;and has generally been called ketton-&s;tone and believed to re&s;emble
the &s;pawn of fi&s;h, it has acquired a form &s;o much rounder than &s;iliceous &s;and from its
being of &s;o much &s;ofter a texture and al&s;o much more &s;oluble in water. There are
other &s;oft calcareous &s;tones called tupha which are depo&s;ited from water on mo&s;&s;es, as at
Matlock, from which mo&s;s it is probable the water may receive &s;omething which induces
it the readier to part with its earth.</P>
<P>In &s;ome lime-&s;tones the living animals &s;eem to have been buried as well as their &s;hells
during &s;ome great convul&s;ion of nature, the&s;e &s;hells contain a black coaly &s;ub&s;tance
within them, in others &s;ome phlogi&s;ton or volatile alcali from the bodies of the dead
animals remains mixed with the &s;tone, which is then called liver-&s;tone as it emits a
&s;ulphurous &s;mell on being &s;truck, and there is a &s;tratum about &s;ix inches thick extends a
con&s;iderable way over the iron ore at Wingerworth near Che&s;terfield in Derby&s;hire
which &s;eems evidently to have been formed from the &s;hells of fre&s;h-water mu&s;cles</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="263">
There is however another &s;ource of calcareous earth be&s;ides the aquatic one above
de&s;cribed and that is from the recrements of land animals and vegetables as found in
marls, which con&s;i&s;t of various mixtures of calcareous earth, &s;and, and clay, all of
them perhaps principally from vegetable origin.</P>
<P>Dr. Hutton is of opinion that the rocks of marble have been &s;oftened by fire into
a fluid ma&s;s, which he thinks under immen&s;e pre&s;&s;ure might be done without the e&s;cape
of their carbonic acid or fixed air. Edinb. Tran&s;act. Vol. I. If this ingenious idea be
allowed it might account for the purity of &s;ome white marbles, as during their fluid
&s;tate there might be time for their partial impurities, whether from the bodies of the
animals which produced the &s;hells or from other extraneous matter, either to &s;ublime
to the uppermo&s;t part of the &s;tratum or to &s;ub&s;ide to the lowermo&s;t part of it. As a
confirmation of this theory of Dr. Hutton's it may be added that &s;ome calcareous
&s;tones are found mixed with lime, and have thence lo&s;t a part of their fixed air or
carbonic gas, as the bath-&s;tone, and on that account hardens on being expo&s;ed to the
air, and mixed with &s;ulphur produces calcareous liver of &s;ulphur. Falconer on Bath|water.

many yards deep a ma&s;s of vegetation. This fact is curiou&s;ly verified by an account
given many years ago by the Earl of Cromartie, of which the following is a &s;hort
ab&s;tract.</P>
<P>In the year 1651 the EARL OF CROMARTIE being then nineteen years of age &s;aw a
plain in the pari&s;h of Lockburn covered over with a firm &s;tanding wood, which was &s;o
old that not only the trees had no green leaves upon them but the bark was totally
thrown off, which he was there informed by the old countrymen was the univer&s;al
manner in which fir-woods terminated, and that in twenty or thirty years the trees
would ca&s;t them&s;elves up by the roots. About fifteen years after he had occa&s;ion to
travel the &s;ame way and ob&s;erved that there was not a tree nor the appearance of a
root of any of them; but in their place the whole plain where the wood &s;tood was
<PB N="35" REF="264">
covered with a flat green mo&s;s or mora&s;s, and on a&s;king the country people what was
become of the wood he was informed that no one had been at the trouble to carry it
away, but that it had all been overturned by the wind, that the trees lay thick over each
other, and that the mo&s;s or bog had overgrown the whole timber, which they added was
occa&s;ioned by the moi&s;ture which came down from the high hills above it and &s;tagnated
upon the plain, and that nobody could yet pa&s;s over it, which however his Lord&s;hip was
&s;o incautious as to attempt and &s;lipt up to the arm-pits. Before the year 1699 that whole
piece of ground was become a &s;olid mo&s;s wherein the pea&s;ants then dug turf or peat,
which however was not yet of the be&s;t &s;ort. Philos. Trans. No. 330. Abridg. Vol. V.
p. 272.</P>
<P>Mora&s;&s;es in great length of time undergo variety of changes, fir&s;t by elutriation, and
afterwards by fermentation, and the con&s;equent heat. 1. By water perpetually oozing
through them the mo&s;t &s;oluble parts are fir&s;t wa&s;hed away, as the e&s;&s;ential &s;alts, the&s;e
together with the &s;alts from animal recrements are carried down the rivers into the
&s;ea, where all of them &s;eem to decompo&s;e each other except the marine &s;alt. Hence
the a&s;hes of peat contain little or no vegetable alcali and are not u&s;ed in the countries,
where peat con&s;titutes the fuel of the lower people, for the purpo&s;e of wa&s;hing linen.
The &s;econd thing which is always &s;een oozing from mora&s;&s;es is iron in &s;olution, which
produces chalybeate &s;prings, from whence depo&s;itions of ochre and variety of iron ores.
The third elutriation &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t of vegetable acid, which by means unknown
appears to be converted into all other acids. 1. Into marine and nitrous acids as
mentioned above. 2. Into vitriolic acid which is found in &s;ome mora&s;&s;es &s;o plentifully
as to pre&s;erve the bodies of animals from putrefaction which have been buried in them,
and this acid carried away by rain and dews and meeting with calcareous earth produces
gyp&s;um or alaba&s;ter, with clay it produces alum, and deprived of its vital air produces
&s;ulphur. 3. Fluor acid which being wa&s;hed away and meeting with calcareous earth
produces fluor or cubic &s;par. 4. The &s;iliceous acid which &s;eems to have been dis|&s;eminated
in great quantity either by &s;olution in water or by &s;olution in air, and appears
to have produced the &s;and in the &s;ea uniting with calcareous earth previou&s;ly di&s;&s;olved
in that element, from which were afterwards formed &s;ome of the grit-&s;tone rocks by
means of a &s;iliceous or calcareous cement. By its union with the calcareous earth of
the mora&s;s other &s;trata of &s;iliceous &s;and have been produced; and by the mixture of
this with clay and lime aro&s;e the beds of marl.</P>
<P>In other circum&s;tances, probably where le&s;s moi&s;ture has prevailed, mora&s;&s;es &s;eem to
have undergone a fermentation, as other vegetable matter, new hay for in&s;tance is liable
to do from the great quantity of &s;ugar it contains. From the great heat thus produced
in the lower parts of immen&s;e beds of mora&s;s the phlogi&s;tic part, or oil, or a&s;phaltum,
becomes di&s;tilled, and ri&s;ing into higher &s;trata becomes again conden&s;ed forming coal|beds
of greater or le&s;s purity according to their greater or le&s;s quantity of inflammable
matter; at the &s;ame time the clay beds become purer or le&s;s &s;o, as the phlogi&s;tic part is
more or le&s;s completely exhaled from them. Though coal and clay are frequently pro|duced
in this manner, yet I have no doubt, but that they are likewi&s;e often produced by
<PB N="36" REF="265">
elutriation; in &s;ituations on declivities the clay is wa&s;hed away down into the valleys,
and the phlogi&s;tic part or coal left behind; this circum&s;tance is &s;een in many valleys near
the beds of rivers, which are covered recently by a whiti&s;h impure clay, called water|clay.

<P>LORD CROMARTIE has furni&s;hed another curious ob&s;ervation on mora&s;&s;es in the
paper above referred to. In a mo&s;s near the town of Eglin in Murray, though there is
no river or water which communicates with the mo&s;s, yet for three or four feet of depth
in the mo&s;s there are little &s;hell-fi&s;h re&s;embling oy&s;ters with living fi&s;h in them in great
quantities, though no &s;uch fi&s;h are found in the adjacent rivers, nor even in the water
pits in the mo&s;s, but only in the &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance of the mo&s;s. This curious fact not
only accounts for the &s;hells &s;ometimes found on the &s;urface of coals, and in the clay
above them; but al&s;o for a thin &s;tratum of &s;hells which &s;ometimes exi&s;ts over iron-ore.</P>

<P>AS iron is formed near the &s;urface of the earth, it becomes expo&s;ed to &s;treams of
water and of air more than mo&s;t other metallic bodies, and thence becomes combined
with oxygene, or vital air, and appears very frequently in its calciform &s;tate, as in variety
of ochres. Mangane&s;e, and zinc, and &s;ometimes lead, are al&s;o found near the &s;urface of
the earth, and on that account become combined with vital air and are exhibited in their
calciform &s;tate.</P>
<P>The avidity with which iron unites with oxygene, or vital air, in which proce&s;s
much heat is given out from the combining materials, is &s;hewn by a curious experiment
of M. Ingenhouz. A fine iron wire twi&s;ted &s;pirally is fixed to a cork, on the point of the
&s;pire is fixed a match made of agaric dipped in &s;olution of nitre; the match is then
ignited, and the wire with the cork put immediately into a bottle full of vital air, the
match fir&s;t burns vividly, and the iron &s;oon takes fire and con&s;umes with brilliant &s;parks
till it is reduced to &s;mall brittle globules, gaining an addition of about one third of its
weight by its union with vital air. Annales de Chymic. Trait&eacute; de Chimie, per
Lavoi&s;ier, c. iii.</P>

<HEAD>STEEL.</HEAD>
<P>It is probably owing to a total deprivation of vital air which it holds with &s;o great
avidity, that iron on being kept many hours or days in ignited charcoal becomes con|verted
into &s;teel, and thence acquires the faculty of being welded when red hot long
before it melts, and al&s;o the power of becoming hard when immer&s;ed in cold water;
both which I &s;uppo&s;e depend on the &s;ame cau&s;e, that is, on its being a wor&s;e conductor
of heat than other metals; and hence the &s;urface both acquires heat much &s;ooner, and
lo&s;es it much &s;ooner, than the internal parts of it, in this-circum&s;tance re&s;embling gla&s;s.</P>
<P>When &s;teel is made very hot, and &s;uddenly immerged in very cold water, and moved
about in it, the &s;urface of the &s;teel becomes cooled fir&s;t, and thus producing a kind of
ca&s;e or arch over the internal part, prevents that internal part from contracting quite &s;o
much as it otherwi&s;e would do, whence it becomes brittler and harder, like the gla&s;s|drops
called Prince Rupert's drops, which are made by dropping melted gla&s;s into cold
water. This idea is countenanced by the circum&s;tance that hardened &s;teel is &s;pecifically
lighter than &s;teel which is more gradually cooled. (Nichol&s;on's Chemi&s;try, p. 313.)
Why the brittlene&s;s and hardne&s;s of &s;teel or gla&s;s &s;hould keep pace or be companions to
each other may be difficult to conceive.</P>
<P>When a &s;teel &s;pring is forcibly bent till it break, it requires le&s;s power to bend it
through the fir&s;t inch than the &s;econd, and le&s;s through the &s;econd than the third; the
&s;ame I &s;uppo&s;e to happen if a wire be di&s;tended till it break by hanging weights to it;
this &s;hews that the particles may be forced from each other to a &s;mall di&s;tance by le&s;s
power, than is nece&s;&s;ary to make them recede to a greater di&s;tance; in this circum&s;tance
perhaps the attraction of cohe&s;ion differs from that of gravitation, which exerts its power
inver&s;ely as the &s;quares of the di&s;tance. Hence it appears that is the innermo&s;t particles
of a &s;teel bar, by cooling the external &s;urface fir&s;t, are kept from approaching each other
&s;o nearly as they otherwi&s;e would do, that they become in the &s;ituation of the particles
on the convex &s;ide of a bent &s;pring, and can not be forced further from each other except
by a greater power than would have been nece&s;&s;ary to have made them recede thus far.
And &s;econdly, that if they be forced a little further from each other they &s;eparate; this
may be exemplified by laying two magnetic needles parallel to each other, the contrary
poles together, then drawing them longitudinally from each other, they will &s;lide with
&s;mall force till they begin to &s;eparate, and will then require a &s;tronger force to really
&s;eparate them. Hence it appears, that hardne&s;s and brittlene&s;s depend on the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tance,
that the particles are removed to a greater di&s;tance from each other and thus
re&s;i&s;t any power more forcibly which is applied to di&s;place them further, this con&s;titutes
hardne&s;s. And &s;econdly, if they are di&s;placed by &s;uch applied force they immediately
&s;eparate, and this con&s;titutes brittlene&s;s.</P>
<P>Steel may be thus rendered too brittle for many purpo&s;es, on which account arti&s;ts
have means of &s;oftening it again, by expo&s;ing it to certain degrees of heat, for the con|&s;truction
of different kinds of tools, which is called tempering it. Some arti&s;ts plunge
large tools in very cold water as &s;oon as they are compleatly ignited, and moving it about,
<PB N="38" REF="267">
take it out as &s;oon as it cea&s;es to be luminous beneath the water; it is then rubbed
quickly with a file or on &s;and to clean the &s;urface, the heat which the metal &s;till retains
&s;oon begins to produce a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of colours; if a hard temper be required, the piece
is dipped again and &s;tirred about in cold water as &s;oon as the yellow tinge appears, if
it be cooled when the purple tinge appears it becomes fit for gravers' tools u&s;ed in work|ing
upon metals; if cooled while blue it is proper for &s;prings. Nichol&s;on's Chemi&s;try,

<HEAD>MODERN PRODUCTION OF IRON.</HEAD>
<P>The recent production of iron is evinced from the chalybeate waters which flow
from mora&s;&s;es which lie upon gravel-beds, and which mu&s;t therefore have produced
iron after tho&s;e gravel-beds were rai&s;ed out of the &s;ea. On the &s;outh &s;ide of the road
between Cheadle and Okeymoor in Stafford&s;hire, yellow &s;tains of iron are &s;een to pene|trate
the gravel from a thin mora&s;s on its &s;urface. There is a fi&s;&s;ure eight or ten feet
wide, in a gravel-bed on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the hollow road a&s;cending the hill about a
mile from Trentham in Stafford&s;hire, leading toward Drayton in Shrop&s;hire, which
fi&s;&s;ure is filled up with nodules of iron-ore. A bank of &s;ods is now rai&s;ed again&s;t this
fi&s;&s;ure to prevent the loo&s;e iron nodules from falling into the turnpike road, and thus
this natural curio&s;ity is at pre&s;ent concealed from travellers. A &s;imilar fi&s;&s;ure in a bed
of marl, and filled up with iron nodules and with &s;ome large pieces of flint, is &s;een on
the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the hollow road a&s;cending the hill from the turnpike hou&s;e about a
mile from Derby in the road towards Burton. And another &s;uch fi&s;&s;ure filled with iron
nodes, appears about half a mile from Newton-Solney in Derby&s;hire, in the road to
Burton, near the &s;ummit of the hill. The&s;e collections of iron and of flint mu&s;t have
been produced po&s;terior to the elevation of all tho&s;e hills, and were thence evidently of
vegetable or animal origin. To which &s;hould be added, that iron is found in general in
beds either near the &s;urface of the earth, or &s;tratified with clay coals or argillaceous grit,
which are them&s;elves productions of the modern world, that is, from the recrements of
vegetables and air-breathing animals.</P>
<P>Not only iron but manganc&s;e, calamy, and even copper and lead appear in &s;ome
in&s;tances to have been of recent production. Iron and mangane&s;e are detected in all
vegetable productions, and it is probable other metallic bodies might be found to exi&s;t
in vegetable or animal matters, if we had te&s;ts to detect them in very minute quantities.
Mangane&s;e and calamy are found in beds like iron near the &s;urface of the earth, and in
a calciform &s;tate, which countenances their modern production. The recent production
of calamy, one of the ores of zinc, appears from its frequently incru&s;ting calcareous &s;par
in its de&s;cent from the &s;urface of the earth into the uppermo&s;t fi&s;&s;ures of the lime&s;tone
mountains of Derby&s;hire. That the calamy has been carried by its &s;olution or diffu&s;ion
in water into the&s;e cavities, and not by its a&s;cent from below in form of &s;team, is evinced
from its not only forming a cru&s;t over the dogtooth &s;par, but by its afterwards di&s;&s;olving
or de&s;troying the &s;parry cry&s;tal. I have &s;pecimens of calamy in the form of dogtooth
&s;par, two inches high, which are hollow, and &s;tand half an inch above the dimini&s;hed
<PB N="39" REF="268">
&s;parry cry&s;tal on which they were formed, like a &s;heath a great deal too big for it; this
&s;eems to &s;hew, that this proce&s;s was carried on in water, otherwi&s;e after the calamy had
incru&s;ted its &s;par, and di&s;&s;olved its &s;urface, &s;o as to form a hollow cavern over it, it could
not act further upon it except by the interpo&s;ition of &s;ome medium. As the&s;e &s;pars and
calamy are formed in the fi&s;&s;ures of mountains they mu&s;t both have been formed after
the elevation of tho&s;e mountains.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the recent production of copper, it was before ob&s;erved in note on
Canto II. l. 394, that the &s;ummit of the grit-&s;tone mountain at Hawk&s;tone in Shrop&s;hire,
is tinged with copper, which from the appearance of the blue &s;tains &s;eems to have
de&s;cended to the parts of the rock beneath. I have a calciform ore of copper con&s;i&s;ting
of the hollow cru&s;ts of cubic cells, which has evidently been formed on cry&s;tals of fluor,
which it has eroded in the &s;ame manner as the calamy erodes the calcareous cry&s;tals,
from whence may be deduced in the &s;ame manner, the aqueous &s;olution or diffu&s;ion, as
well as the recent production of this calciform ore of copper.</P>
<P>Lead in &s;mall quantities is &s;ometimes found in the fi&s;&s;ures of coal-beds, which fis|&s;ures
are previou&s;ly covered with &s;par; and &s;ometimes in nodules of iron-ore. Of the
former I have a &s;pecimen from near Caulk in Derby&s;hire, and of the latter from Cole|brook
Dale in Shrop&s;hire. Though all the&s;e facts &s;hew that &s;ome metallic bodies are
formed from vegetable or animal recrements, as iron, and perhaps mangane&s;e and
calamy, all which are found near the &s;urface of the earth; yet as the other metals are
found only in fi&s;&s;ures of rocks, which penetrate to unknown depths, they may be wholly
or in part produced by a&s;cending &s;teams from &s;ubterraneous fires, as mentioned in note
on Canto II. l. 394.</P>

<HEAD>SEPTARIA OF IRON-STONE.</HEAD>
<P>Over &s;ome lime works at Wal&s;all in Stafford&s;hire, I ob&s;erved &s;ome years ago a &s;tratum
of iron earth about &s;ix inches thick, full of very large cavities; the&s;e cavities were evi|dently
produced when the material pa&s;&s;ed from a &s;emifluid &s;tate into a &s;olid one; as the
frit of the potters, or a mixture of clay and water is liable to crack in drying; which is
owing to the further contraction of the internal part, after the cru&s;t is become hard.
The&s;e hollows are liable to receive extraneous matter, as I believe gyp&s;um, and &s;ome|times
&s;par, and even lead; a curious &s;pecimen of the la&s;t was pre&s;ented to me by Mr.
Darby of Colebrook Dale, which contains in its cavity &s;ome ounces of lead-ore. But
there are other &s;eptaria of iron-&s;tone which &s;eem to have had a very different origin, their
cavities having been formed in cooling or congealing from an ignited &s;tate, as is inge|niou&s;ly
deduced by Dr. Hutton from their internal &s;truture. Edinb. Tran&s;act. Vol. I.
p. 246. The volcanic origin of the&s;e curious &s;eptaria appears to me to be further evinced
from their form and the places where they are found. They con&s;i&s;t of oblate &s;pheroids
and are found in many parts of the earth totally detached from the beds in which they
lie, as at Ea&s;t Lothian in Scotland. Two of the&s;e, which now lie before me, were found
with many others immer&s;ed in argillaceous &s;hale or &s;hiver, &s;urrounded by broken lime|&s;tone
mountains at Bradbourn near A&s;hbourn in Derby&s;hire, and were pre&s;ented to
<PB N="40" REF="269">
me by Mr. Buxton, a gentleman of that town. One of the&s;e is about fifteen inches in
its equatorial diameter, and about &s;ix inches in its polar one, and contains beautiful &s;tar|like
&s;eptaria incru&s;ted and in part filled with calcareous &s;par. The other is about eight
inches in its equatorial diameter, and about four inches in its polar diameter, and is quite
&s;olid, but &s;hews on its internal &s;urface marks of different colours, as if a beginning &s;epa|ration
had taken place. Now as the&s;e &s;eptaria contain fifty per cent, of iron, according
to Dr. Hutton, they would &s;often or melt into a &s;emifluid globule by &s;ubterraneous fire
by le&s;s heat than the lime&s;tone in their vicinity; and if they were ejected through a hole
or fi&s;&s;ure would gain a circular motion along with their progre&s;&s;ive one by their greater
friction or adhe&s;ion to one &s;ide of the hole. This whirling motion would produce the
oblate &s;pheroidical form which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which as far as I know can not in any
other way be accounted for. They would then harden in the air as they ro&s;e into the
colder parts of the atmo&s;phere; and as they de&s;cended into &s;o &s;oft a material as &s;hale or
&s;hiver, their forms would not be injured in their fall; and their pre&s;ence in materials &s;o
different from them&s;elves becomes accounted for.</P>
<P>About the tropics of the large &s;eptarium above mentioned, are circular eminent lines,
&s;uch as might have been left is it had been coar&s;ely turned in a lathe. The&s;e lines &s;eem
to con&s;i&s;t of a fluid matter, which &s;eems to have ex&s;uded in circular zones, as their edges
appear blunted or retracted; and the &s;eptarium &s;eems to have &s;plit ea&s;ier in &s;uch &s;ections
parallel to its equator. Now as the cru&s;t would fir&s;t begin to cool and harden after its
ejection in a &s;emifluid &s;tate, and the equatorial diameter would become gradually enlarged
as it ro&s;e in the air; the internal parts being &s;ofter would &s;lide beneath the polar cru&s;t,
which might crack and permit part of the &s;emifluid to ex&s;ude, and it is probable the
adhe&s;ion would thus become le&s;s in &s;ections parallel to the equator. Which further
confirms this idea of the production of the&s;e curious &s;eptaria. A new-ca&s;t cannon ball
red-hot with its cru&s;t only &s;olid, if it were &s;hot into the air would propably bur&s;t in its
pa&s;&s;age; as it would con&s;i&s;t of a more fluid material than the&s;e &s;eptaria; and thus
by di&s;charging a &s;hower of liquid iron would produce more dreadful combu&s;tion, if u&s;ed
in war, than could be effected by a ball, which had been cooled and was heated again:
&s;ince in the latter ca&s;e the ball could not have its internal parts made hotter than the
cru&s;t of it, without fir&s;t loo&s;ing its form.</P>

<HEAD>1. SILICEOUS ROCKS.</HEAD>
<P>THE great ma&s;&s;es of &s;iliceous &s;and which lie in rocks upon the beds of lime&s;tone, or
which are &s;tratified with clay, coal, and iron-ore, are evidently produced in the decom|po&s;ition
of vegetable or animal matters, as explained in the note on mora&s;&s;es. Hence
the impre&s;&s;ions of vegetable roots and even whole trees are often found in &s;and-&s;tone, as
well as in coals and iron-ore. In the&s;e &s;and-rocks both the &s;iliceous acid and the cal|careous
ba&s;e &s;eem to be produced from the materials of the mora&s;s; for though the
prefence of a &s;iliceous acid and of a calcareous ba&s;e have not yet been &s;eparately exhibited
from flints, yet from the analogy of flint to fluor, and gyp&s;um, and marble, and from
the conver&s;ion of the latter into flint, there can be little doubt of their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;iliceous &s;and-rocks are either held together by a &s;iliceous cement, or have a
greater or le&s;s portion of clay in them, which in &s;ome acts as a cement to the &s;iliceous
cry&s;tals, but in others is in &s;uch great abundance that in burning them they become an
imperfect porcelain and are then u&s;ed to repair the roads, as at Che&s;terfield in Derby&s;hire;
the&s;e are called argillaceous grit by Mr. Kirwan. In other places a calcareous matter
cements the cry&s;tals together; and in other places the &s;iliceous cry&s;tals lie in loo&s;e &s;trata
under the marl in the form of white &s;and; as at Normington about a mile from Derby.</P>
<P>The lowe&s;t beds of &s;iliceous &s;and-&s;tone produced from mora&s;&s;es &s;eem to obtain their
acid from the mora&s;s, and their calcareous ba&s;e from the lime&s;tone on which it re&s;ts.
The&s;e beds po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;iliceous cement, and from their greater purity and hardne&s;s are
u&s;ed for cour&s;e grinding-&s;tones and &s;cyth &s;tones, and are &s;ituated on the edges of lime|&s;tone
countries, having lo&s;t the other &s;trata of coals, or clay, or iron, which were origi|nally
produced above them. Such are the &s;and-rocks incumbent on lime&s;tone near
Matlock in Derby&s;hire. As the&s;e &s;iliceous &s;and-rocks contain no marine productions
&s;cattered among&s;t them, they appear to have been elevated, torn to pieces, and many
fragments of them &s;cattered over the adjacent country by explo&s;ions, from fires within
the mora&s;s from which they have been formed; and which di&s;&s;ipated every thing in|flammable
above and beneath them, except &s;ome &s;tains of iron, with which they are in
&s;ome places &s;potted. If the&s;e &s;and-rocks had been accumulated beneath the &s;ea, and
elevated along with the beds of lime&s;tone on which they re&s;t, &s;ome ve&s;tiges of marine
&s;hells either in their &s;iliceous or calcareous &s;tate mu&s;t have been di&s;cerned among&s;t
them.</P>

<HEAD>2. SILICEOUS TREES.</HEAD>
<P>In many of the&s;e &s;and-rocks are found the impre&s;&s;ions of vegetable roots, which &s;eem
to have been the mo&s;t unchangeable parts of the plant, as &s;hells and &s;hark's teeth are
found in chalk-beds from their being the mo&s;t unchangeable parts of the animal. In
other in&s;tances the wood it&s;elf is penetrated, and whole trees converted into flint; &s;peci|mens
of which I have by me, from near Covenery, and from a gravel-pit in Shrop&s;hire
near Child's Archal in the road to Drayton. Other poli&s;hed &s;pecimens of vegetable
flints abound in the cabinets of the curious, which evidently &s;hew the concentric circles
of woody fibres, and their inter&s;tices filled with whiter &s;iliceous matter, with the branch|ing
off of the knots when cut horizontally, and the parallel lines of wood when cut
longitudinally, with uncommon beauty and variety. Of the&s;e I po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome beautiful
&s;pecimens, which were pre&s;ented to me by the Earl of Uxbridge.</P>
<P>The colours of the&s;e &s;iliceous vegetables are generally brown, from the iron, I &s;uppo&s;e,
or mangane&s;e, which induced them to cry&s;tallize or to fu&s;e more ea&s;ily. Some of the
cracks of the wood in drying are filled with white flint or calcedony, and others of them
remain hollow, lined with innumerable &s;mall cry&s;tals tinged with iron, which I &s;uppo&s;e
had a &s;hare in converting their calcareous matter into &s;iliceous cry&s;tals, becau&s;e the
cry&s;tals called Peak-diamonds are always found bedded in an ochreous earth; and tho&s;e
called Bri&s;tol-&s;tones are &s;ituated on lime&s;tone coloured with iron. Mr. F. French pre&s;ented
me with a congeries of &s;iliceous cry&s;tals, which he gathered on the crater (as he &s;uppo&s;es)
of an extingui&s;hed volcano at Cromach Water in Cumberland. The cry&s;tals are about
an inch high in the &s;hape of dogtooth or calcareous &s;par, covered with a dark ferruginous
matter. The bed on which they re&s;t is about an inch in thickne&s;s, and is &s;tained with
iron on its under&s;urface. This curious fo&s;&s;il &s;hews the tran&s;mutation of calcareous earth
into &s;iliceous, as much as the &s;iliceous &s;hells which abound in the cabinets of the curious.
There may &s;ometime be di&s;covered in this age of &s;cience, a method of thus impregnating
wood with liquid flint, which would produce pillars for the &s;upport, and tiles for the
covering of hou&s;es, which would be uninflammable and endure as long as the earth
beneath them.</P>
<P>That &s;ome &s;iliceous productions have been in a fluid &s;tate without much heat at the
time of their formation appears from the vegetable flints above de&s;cribed not having quite
lo&s;t their organized appearance; from &s;hells, and coralloids, and entrochi being converted
into flint without loo&s;ing their form; from the ba&s;on of calcedony round Gie&s;ar in
Iceland; and from the experiment of Mr. Bergman, who obtained thirteen regular formed
cry&s;tals by &s;uffering the powder of quartz to remain in a ve&s;&s;el with fluor acid for two
years; the&s;e cry&s;tals were about the &s;ize of &s;mall peas, and were not &s;o hard as quartz.
Opu&s;c. de Terr&acirc; Silice&acirc;, p. 33. Mr. Achard procured both calcareous and &s;iliceous
cry&s;tals, one from calcareous earth, and the other from the earth of alum, both di&s;&s;olved
in water impregnated with fixed air; the water filtrating very &s;lowly through a porous
bottom of baked clay. See Journal de Phy&s;ique, for January, 1778.</P>

<HEAD>3. AGATES, ONYXES, SCOTS-PEBBLES.</HEAD>
<P>In &s;mall cavities of the&s;e &s;and-rocks, I am informed, the beautiful &s;iliceous nodules are
found which are called Scot's-pebbles; and which on being cut in different directions
take the names of agates, onyxes, &s;ardonyxes, &amp;c. according to the colours of the lines
or &s;trata which they exhibit. Some of the nodules are hollow and filled with cry&s;tals,
others have a nucleus of le&s;s compact &s;iliceous matter which is generally white, &s;urrounded
with many concentric &s;trata coloured with iron, and other alternate &s;trata of white agate
or calcedony, &s;ometimes to the number of thirty.</P>
<P>I think the&s;e nodules bear evident marks of their having been in perfect fu&s;ion by
either heat alone, or by water and heat, under great pre&s;&s;ure, according to the ingenious
theory of Dr. Hutton; but I do not imagine, that they were injected into cavities from
materials from without, but that &s;ome vegetables or parts of vegetables containing
more iron or mangane&s;e than others, facilitated the compleat fu&s;ion, thus de&s;troying
the ve&s;tiges of vegetable organization, which were con&s;picuous in the &s;iliceous trees
above mentioned. Some of the&s;e nodules being hollow and lined with cry&s;tals, and
others containing a nucleus of white &s;iliceous matter of a loo&s;er texture, &s;hew they
were compo&s;ed of the materials then exi&s;ting in the cavity; which con&s;i&s;ting before of
loo&s;e &s;and, mu&s;t take up le&s;s &s;pace when fu&s;ed into a &s;olid ma&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;iliceous nodules re&s;emble the nodules of iron-&s;tone mentioned in note on
Canto II. l. 179, in re&s;pect to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a great number of concentric &s;pheres
coloured generally with iron, but they differ in this circum&s;tance, that the concentric
&s;pheres generally obey the form of the external cru&s;t, and in their not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a chaly|beate
nucleus. The &s;talactites formed on the roofs of caverns are often coloured in
concentric &s;trata, by their coats being &s;pread over each other at different times; and &s;ome
of them, as the cupreous ones, po&s;&s;e&s;s great beauty from this formation; but as the&s;e are
nece&s;&s;arily more or le&s;s of a cylindrical or conic form, the nodules or globular flints
above de&s;cribed cannot have been con&s;tructed in this manner. To what law of nature
then is to be referred the production of &s;uch numerous concentric &s;pheres? I &s;u&s;pect to
the law of congelation.</P>
<P>When &s;alt and water are expo&s;ed to &s;evere fro&s;ty air, the &s;alt is &s;aid to be precipitated
as the water freezes; that is, as the heat, in which it was di&s;&s;olved, is withdrawn; where
the experiment is tried in a bowl or ba&s;on, this may be true, as the &s;urface freezes fir&s;t,
and the &s;alt is found at the bottom. But in a fluid expo&s;ed in a thin phial, I found by
experiment, that the extraneous matter previou&s;ly di&s;&s;olved by the heat in the mixture
was not &s;imply &s;et at liberty to &s;ub&s;ide, but was detruded or pu&s;hed backward as the ice
was produced. The experiment was this: about two ounces of a &s;olution of blue
vitriol were accidentally frozen in a thin phial, the gla&s;s was cracked and fallen to pieces,
the ice was di&s;&s;olved, and I found a pillar of blue vitriol &s;tanding erect on the bottom
of the broken bottle. Nor is this power of congelation more extraordinary, than that
by its powerful and &s;udden expan&s;ion it &s;hould bur&s;t iron &s;hells and coehorns, or throw

out the plugs with which the water was &s;ecured in them above one hundred and thirty
yards, according to the experiments at Quebec by Major Williams. Edinb. Tran&s;act.
Vol. II. p. 23.</P>
<P>In &s;ome &s;iliceous nodules which now lie before me, the external cru&s;t for about the
tenth of an inch con&s;i&s;ts of white agate, in others it is much thinner, and in &s;ome much
thicker; corre&s;ponding with this cru&s;t there are from twenty to thirty &s;uperincumbent
&s;trata, of alternately darker and lighter colour; whence it appears, that the external cru&s;t
as it cooled or froze, propelled from it the iron or mangane&s;e which was di&s;&s;olved in it;
this receded till it had formed an arch or vault &s;trong enough to re&s;i&s;t its further pro|tru&s;ion;
then the next inner &s;phere or &s;tratum as it cooled or froze, propelled forwards
its colouring matter in the &s;ame manner, till another arch or &s;phere produced &s;ufficient
re&s;i&s;tance to this frigorific expul&s;ion. Some of them have detruded their colouring
matter quite to the centre, the rings continuing to become darker as they are nearer it;
in others the chalybeate arch &s;eems to have &s;topped half an inch from the centre, and
become thicker by having attracted to it&s;elf the irony matter from the white nucleus,
owing probably to its cooling le&s;s precipitately in the central parts than at the &s;urface of
the pebble.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar detru&s;ion of a marly matter in circular arches or vaults obtains in the &s;alt
mines in Che&s;hire; from whence Dr. Hutton very ingeniou&s;ly concludes, that the &s;alt
mu&s;t have been liquified by heat; which would &s;eem to be be much confirmed by the
above theory. Edinb. Tran&s;act. Vol. I. p. 244.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this account of Scots-pebbles without ob&s;erving that &s;ome of them
on being &s;awed longitudinally a&s;under, &s;eem &s;till to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome ve&s;tiges of the cylindrical
organization of vegetables; others po&s;&s;e&s;s a nucleus of white agate much re&s;embling &s;ome
bulbous roots with their concentric coats, or the knots in elm-roots or crab-trees; &s;ome
of the&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e were formed in the manner above explained, during the congelation
of ma&s;&s;es of melted flint and iron; others may have been formed from a vegetable
nucleus, and retain &s;ome ve&s;tiges of the organization of the plant.</P>

<HEAD>4. SAND OF THE SEA.</HEAD>
<P>The great abundance of &s;iliceous &s;and at the bottom of the ocean may in part be
wa&s;hed down from the &s;iliceous rocks above de&s;cribed, but in general I &s;uppo&s;e it derives
its acid only from the vegetable and animal matter of mora&s;&s;es, which is carried down by
floods or by the atmo&s;phere, and becomes united in the &s;ea with its calcareous ba&s;e from
&s;hells and coralloids, and thus a&s;&s;umes its cry&s;talline form at the bottom of the ocean, and is
there intermixed with gravel or other matters wa&s;hed from the mountains in its vicinity.</P>

<HEAD>5. CHERT, OR PETROSILEX.</HEAD>
<P>The rocks of marble are often alternately intermixed with &s;trata of chert, or coar&s;e
flint, and this in beds from one to three feet thick, as at Ilam and Matlock, or of le&s;s
than the tenth of an inch in thickne&s;s, as a mile or two from Bakewell in the road to
<PB N="45" REF="274">
Buxton. It is difficult to conceive in what manner ten or twenty &s;trata of either lime|&s;tone
or flint, of different &s;hades of white and black, could be laid quite regularly over
each other from &s;ediments or precipitations from the &s;ea; it appears to me much ea&s;ier
to comprehend, by &s;uppo&s;ing with Dr. Hutton, that both the &s;olid rocks of marble and
the flint had been fu&s;ed by great heat, (or by heat and water,) under immen&s;e pre&s;&s;ure;
by its cooling or congelating the colouring matter might be detruded, and form parallel
or curvilinean &s;trata, as above explained.</P>
<P>The colouring matter both of lime&s;tone and flint was probably owing to the fle&s;h of
peculiar animals, as well as the &s;iliceous acid, which converted &s;ome of the lime&s;tone into
flint; or to &s;ome &s;trata of &s;hell-fi&s;h having been overwhelmed when alive with new
materials, while others dying in their natural &s;ituations would lo&s;e their fle&s;hy parts,
either by its putrid &s;olution in the water or by its being eaten by other &s;ea-in&s;ects. I have
&s;ome calcareous fo&s;&s;il &s;hells which contain a black coaly matter in them, which was
evidently the body of the animal, and others of the &s;ame kind filled with &s;par in&s;tead of
it. The Labradore &s;tone has I &s;uppo&s;e its colours from the nacre or mother-pearl &s;hells,
from which it was probably produced. And there is a &s;tratum of calcareous matter
about &s;ix or eight inches thick at Wingerworth in Derby&s;hire over the iron-beds, which
is replete with &s;hells of fre&s;h-water mu&s;cles, and evidently obtains its dark colour from
them, as mentioned in note XVI. Many nodules of flint re&s;emble in colour as well as
in form the &s;hell of the echinus or &s;ea-urchin; others re&s;emble &s;ome coralloids both
in form and colour; and M. Arduini found in the Monte de Pancra&s;io, red flints
branching like corals, from whence they &s;eem to have obtained both their form and
their colour. Ferber's Travels in Italy, p. 42.</P>

<HEAD>6. NODULES OF FLINT IN CHALK-BEDS.</HEAD>
<P>As the nodules of flint found in chalk-beds po&s;&s;e&s;s no marks of having been rounded
by attrition or &s;olution, I conclude that they have gained their form as well as their dark
colour from the fle&s;h of the &s;hell-fi&s;h from which they had their origin; but which have
been &s;o compleatly fu&s;ed by heat, or heat and water, as to obliterate all ve&s;tiges of the
&s;hell, in the &s;ame manner as the nodules of agate and onyx were produced from parts of
vegetables, but which had been &s;o completely fu&s;ed as to obliterate all marks of their
organization, or as many iron-nodules have obtained their form and origin from peculiar
vegetables.</P>
<P>Some nodules in chalk-beds con&s;i&s;t of &s;hells of echini filled up with chalk, the animal
having been di&s;&s;olved away by putre&s;cence in water, or eaten by other &s;ea-in&s;ects; other
&s;hells of echini, in which I &s;uppo&s;e the animal's body remained, are converted into flint
but &s;till retain the form of the &s;hell. Others, I &s;uppo&s;e as above, being more completely
fu&s;ed, have become flint coloured by the animal fle&s;h, but without the exact form either
of the fle&s;h or &s;hell of the animal. Many of the&s;e are hollow within and lined with
cry&s;tals, like the Scot's-pebbles above de&s;cribed; but as the colouring matter of animal
<PB N="46" REF="275">
bodies differs but little from each other compared with tho&s;e of vegetables, the&s;e flints
vary le&s;s in their colours than tho&s;e above mentioned. At the &s;ame time as they cooled
in concentric &s;pheres like the Scot's-pebbles, they often po&s;&s;e&s;s faint rings of colours, and
always break in concholoid forms like them.</P>
<P>This idea of the production of nodules of flint in chalk-beds is countenanced from
the iron which generally appears as the&s;e flints become decompo&s;ed by the air; which
by uniting with the iron in their compo&s;ition reduces it from a vitre&s;cent &s;tate to that of
calx, and thus renders it vi&s;ible. And &s;econdly, by there being no appearance in chalk-beds
of a &s;tring or pipe of &s;iliceous matter connecting one nodule with another, which
mu&s;t have happened if the &s;iliceous matter, or its acid, had been injected from without
according to the idea of Dr. Hutton. And thirdly, becau&s;e many of them have very
large cavities at their centres, which &s;hould not have happened had they been formed by
the injection of a material from without.</P>
<P>When &s;hells or chalk are thus converted from calcareous to &s;iliceous matter by the
fle&s;h of the animal, the new flint being heavier than the &s;hell or chalk occupies le&s;s &s;pace
than the materials it was produced from; this is the cau&s;e of frequent cavities within
them, where the whole ma&s;s has not been completely fu&s;ed and pre&s;&s;ed together. In
Derby&s;hire there are ma&s;&s;es of coralloid and other &s;hells which have become &s;iliceous,
and are thus left with large vacuities &s;ometimes within and &s;ometimes on the out&s;ide of
the remaining form of the &s;hell, like the French mill&s;tones, and I &s;uppo&s;e might &s;erve
the &s;ame purpo&s;e; the gravel of the Derwent is full of &s;pecimens of this kind.</P>
<P>Since writing the above I have received a very ingenious account of chalk-beds from
Dr. MENISH of Chelm&s;ford. He di&s;tingui&s;hes chalk-beds into three kinds; &s;uch as have
been rai&s;ed from the &s;ea with little di&s;turbance of their &s;trata, as the cliffs of Dover and
Margate, which he terms <HI>intire</HI> chalk. Another &s;tate of chalk is where it has &s;uffered
much derangement, as the banks of the Thames at Grave&s;end and Dartford. And a
third &s;tate where fragments of chalk have been rounded by water, which he terms
<HI>alluvial</HI> chalk. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;ituations of chalk he ob&s;erves, that the flint lies in
&s;trata horizontally, generally in di&s;tinct nodules, but that he has ob&s;erved two in&s;tances
of &s;olid plates or &s;trata of flint, from an inch to two inches in thickne&s;s, interpo&s;ed
between the chalk-beds; one of the&s;e is in a chalk-bank by the road &s;ide at Berkham&s;tead,
the other in a bank on the road from Chatham leading to Canterbury. Dr. Meni&s;h has
further ob&s;erved, that many of the echini are cru&s;hed in their form, and yet filled with
flint, which has taken the form of the cru&s;hed &s;hell, and that though many flint nodules
are hollow, yet that in &s;ome echini the &s;iliceum &s;eems to have enlarged, as it pa&s;&s;ed from
a fluid to a &s;olid &s;tate, as it &s;wells out in a protuberance at the mouth and anus of the
&s;hell, and that though the&s;e &s;hells are &s;o filled with flint yet that in many places the &s;hell
it&s;elf remains calcareous. The&s;e &s;trata of nodules and plates of flint &s;eem to countenance
their origin from the fle&s;h of a &s;tratum of animals which peri&s;hed by &s;ome natural
violence, and were buried in their &s;hells.</P>

<HEAD>7. ANGLES OF SILICEOUS SAND.</HEAD>
<P>In many rocks of &s;iliceous &s;and the particles retain their angular form, and in &s;ome
beds of loo&s;e &s;and, of which there is one of con&s;iderable purity a few yards beneath the
marl at Normington about a mile &s;outh of Derby. Other &s;iliceous &s;ands have had their
angles rounded off, like the pebbles in gravel-beds. The&s;e &s;eem to owe their globular
form to two cau&s;es; one to their attrition again&s;t each other, when they may for centuries
have lain at the bottom of the &s;ea, or of rivers; where they may have been progre&s;&s;ively
accumulated, and thus progre&s;&s;ively at the &s;ame time rubbed upon each other by the
da&s;hing of the water, and where they would be more ea&s;ily rolled over each other by the
their gravity being &s;o much le&s;s than in air. This is evidently now going on in the river
Derwent, for though there are no lime&s;tone rocks for ten or fifteen miles above Derby,
yet a great part of the river-gravel at Derby con&s;i&s;ts of lime&s;tone nodules, who&s;e angles
are quite worn off in their de&s;cent down the &s;tream.</P>
<P>There is however another cau&s;e which mu&s;t have contributed to round the angles
both of calcareous and &s;iliceous fragments; and that is, their &s;olubility in water; calca|reous
earth is perpetually found &s;u&s;pended in the waters which pa&s;s over it; and the
earth of flints was ob&s;erved by Bergman to be contained in water in the proportion of
one grain to a gallon. Kirwan's Mineralogy, p. 107. In boiling water, however, it is
&s;oluble in much greater proportion, as appears from the &s;iliceous earth &s;ublimed in the
di&s;tillation of fluor acid in gla&s;s ve&s;&s;els; and from the ba&s;ons of calcedony which &s;ur|rounded
the jets of hot water near mount Heccla in Iceland. Troil on Iceland. It is
probable mo&s;t &s;iliceous &s;ands or pebbles have at &s;ome ages of the world been long expo&s;ed
to aqueous &s;teams rai&s;ed by &s;ubterranean fires. And if fragments of &s;tone were long
immer&s;ed in a fluid men&s;trum, their angular parts would be fir&s;t di&s;&s;olved, on account of
their greater &s;urface.</P>
<P>Many beds of &s;iliceous gravel are cemented together by a &s;iliceous cement, and are
called breccia; as the plumb-pudding &s;tones of Hartford&s;hire, and the walls of a &s;ubter|raneous
temple excavated by Mr. Curzon, at Hagley near Rugely in Stafford&s;hire; the&s;e
may have been expo&s;ed to great heat as they were immer&s;ed in water; which water under
great pre&s;&s;ure of &s;uperincumbent materials may have been rendered red-hot, as in Papin's
dige&s;ter; and have thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed powers of &s;olution with which we are unacquainted.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>8. BASALTES AND GRANITES.</HEAD>
<P>Another &s;our&s;e of &s;iliceous &s;tones is from the granite, or ba&s;altes, or porphyries, which
are of different hardne&s;&s;es according to the materials of their compo&s;ition, or to the fire
they have undergone; &s;uch are the &s;tones of Arthur's-hill near Edinburgh, of the Giant's
Cau&s;way in Ireland, and of Charnwood Fore&s;t in Leice&s;ter&s;hire; the uppermo&s;t &s;tratum
of which la&s;t &s;eems to have been cracked either by its elevation, or by its ha&s;tily cooling
after ignition by the contact of dews or &s;nows, and thus breaks into angular fragments,
&s;uch as the &s;treets of London are paved with; or have had their angles rounded by
<PB N="48" REF="277">
attrition or by partial &s;olution; and have thus formed the common paving &s;tones or
bowlers; as well as the gravel, which is often rolled into &s;trata amid the &s;iliceous &s;and|beds,
which are either formed or collected in the &s;ea.</P>
<P>In what manner &s;uch a ma&s;s of cry&s;tallized matter as the Giant's Cau&s;way and &s;imilar
columns of ba&s;altes, could have been rai&s;ed without other volcanic appearances, may be a
matter not ea&s;y to comprehend; but there is another power in nature be&s;ides that of
expan&s;ile vapour which may have rai&s;ed &s;ome materials which have previou&s;ly been in
igneous or aqueous &s;olution; and that is the act of congelation. When the water in
the experiments above related of Major Williams had by congelation thrown out the
plugs from the bomb-&s;hells, a column of ice ro&s;e from the hole of the bomb &s;ix or eight
inches high. Other bodies I &s;u&s;pect increa&s;e in bulk which cry&s;tallize in cooling, as iron
and type-metal. I remember pouring eight or ten pounds of melted brim&s;tone into
a pot to cool and was &s;urprized to &s;ee after a little time a part of the fluid beneath
break a hole in the congealed cru&s;t above it, and gradually ri&s;e into a promontory &s;everal
inches high; the ba&s;altes has many marks of fu&s;ion and of cry&s;tallization and may
thence, as well as many other kinds of rocks, as of &s;par, marble, petro&s;ilex, ja&s;per, &amp;c.
have been rai&s;ed by the power of congelation, a power who&s;e quantity has not yet
been a&s;certained, and perhaps greater and more univer&s;al than that of vapours expanded
by heat. The&s;e ba&s;altic columns ri&s;e &s;ometimes out of mountains of granite it&s;elf, as
mentioned by Dr. Beddoes, (Phil. Tran&s;act. Vol. LXXX.) and as they &s;eem to con&s;i&s;t
of &s;imilar materials more completely fu&s;ed, there is &s;till greater rea&s;on to believe them
to have been elevated in the cooling or cry&s;tallization of the ma&s;s. See note XXIV.</P>

<P>THE philo&s;ophers, who have attended to the formation of the earth, have ac|knowledged
two great agents in producing the various changes which the terraqueous
globe has undergone, and the&s;e are water and fire. Some of them have perhaps a&s;cribed
too much to one of the&s;e great agents of nature, and &s;ome to the other. They have
generally agreed that the &s;tratification of materials could only be produced from &s;ediments
or precipitations, which were previou&s;ly mixed or di&s;&s;olved in the &s;ea; and that whatever
effects were produced by fire were performed afterwards.</P>
<P>There is however great difficulty in accounting for the univer&s;al &s;tratification of the
&s;olid globe of the earth in this manner, &s;ince many of the materials, which appear in
&s;trata, could not have been &s;u&s;pended in water; as the nodules of flint in chalk-beds,
the exten&s;ive beds of &s;hells, and la&s;tly the &s;trata of coal, clay, &s;and, and iron-ore,
which in mo&s;t coal-countries lie from five to &s;even times alternately &s;tratified over each
other, and none of them are &s;oluble in water. Add to this if a &s;olution of them or a
mixture of them in water could be &s;uppo&s;ed, the cau&s;e of that &s;olution mu&s;t cea&s;e before
a precipitation could commence.</P>
<P>1. The great ma&s;&s;es of lava, under the various names of granite, porphyry, toad&s;tone,
moor-&s;tone, rag, and &s;late, which con&s;titute the old word, may have acquired the &s;trati|fication,
which &s;ome of them appear to po&s;&s;e&s;s, by their having been formed by &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
eruptions of a fluid ma&s;s, which at different periods of antient time aro&s;e from
volcanic &s;hafts and covered each other, the &s;urface of the interior ma&s;s of lava would
cool and become &s;olid before the &s;uperincumbent &s;tratum was poured over it; to the
&s;ame cau&s;e may be a&s;cribed their different compo&s;itions and textures, which are &s;carcely
the &s;ame in any two parts of the world.</P>
<P>2. The &s;tratifications of the great ma&s;&s;es of lime&s;tone, which were produced from
&s;ea-&s;hells, &s;eem to have been formed by the different times at which the innumerable
&s;hells were produced and depo&s;ited. A colony of echini, or madrepores, or cornua
ammonis, lived and peri&s;hed in one period of time; in another a new colony of either
&s;imilar or different &s;hells lived and died over the former ones, producing a &s;tratum of
more recent &s;hell over a &s;tratum of others which had began to petrify or to become
marble; and thus from unknown depths to what are now the &s;ummits of mountains
the lime&s;tone is di&s;po&s;ed in &s;trata of varying &s;olidity and colour. The&s;e have afterwards
undergone variety of changes by their &s;olution and depo&s;ition from the water in which
they were immer&s;ed, or from having been expo&s;ed to great heat under great pre&s;&s;ure,
according to the ingenious theory of Dr. Hutton, Edinb. Tran&s;act. Vol. I. Sec
Note XVI.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="279">
3. In mo&s;t of the coal-countries of this i&s;land there are from five to &s;even beds of
coal &s;tratified with an equal number of beds, though of much greater thickne&s;s, of clay
and &s;and&s;tone, and occa&s;ionally of iron-ores. In what manner to account for the
&s;tratification of the&s;e materials &s;eems to be a problem of greater difficulty. Philo&s;ophers
have generally &s;uppo&s;ed that they have been arranged by the currents of the &s;ea;
but con&s;idering their in&s;olubility in water, and their almo&s;t &s;imilar &s;pecific gravity, an
accumulation of them in &s;uch di&s;tinct beds from this cau&s;e is altogether inconceiveable,
though &s;ome coal-countries bear marks of having been at &s;ome time immer&s;ed beneath
the waves and rai&s;ed again by &s;ubterranean fires.</P>
<P>The higher and lower parts of mora&s;&s;es were nece&s;&s;arily produced at different periods
of time, &s;ee Note XVII. and would thus originally be formed in &s;trata of different
ages. For when an old wood peri&s;hed, and produced a mora&s;s, many centuries would
elap&s;e before another wood could grow and peri&s;h, again upon the &s;ame ground, which
would thus produce a new &s;tratum of mora&s;s over the other, differing indeed principally
in its age, and perhaps, as the timber might be different, in the proportions of its
component parts.</P>
<P>Now if we &s;uppo&s;e the lowermo&s;t &s;tratum of a mora&s;s become ignited, like fermenting
hay, (after whatever could be carried away by &s;olution in water was gone,) what would
happen? Certainly the inflammable part, the oil, &s;ulphur, or bitumen, would burn
away, and be evaporated in air; and the fixed parts would be left, as clay, lime, and
iron; while &s;ome of the calcareous earth would join with the &s;iliceous acid, and produce
&s;and, or with the argillaceous earth, and produce marl. Thence after many centuries
another bed would take fire, but with le&s;s degree of ignition, and with a greater body of
mora&s;s over it, what then would happen? The bitumen and &s;ulphur would ri&s;e and
might become conden&s;ed under an impervious &s;tratum, which might not be ignited, and
there form coal of different purities according to its degree of fluidity, which would
permit &s;ome of the clay to &s;ub&s;ide through it into the place from which it was
&s;ublimed.</P>
<P>Some centuries afterwards another &s;imilar proce&s;s might take place, and either thicken
the coal-bed, or produce a new clay-bed, or marl, or &s;and, or depo&s;it iron upon it,
according to the concomitant circum&s;tances above mentioned.</P>
<P>I do not mean to contend that a few ma&s;&s;es of &s;ome materials may not have been
rolled together by currents, when the mountains were much more elevated than at
pre&s;ent, and in con&s;equence the rivers broader and more rapid, and the &s;torms of rain
and wind greater both in quantity and force. Some gravel-beds may have been thus
wa&s;hed from the mountains; and &s;ome white clay wa&s;hed from mora&s;&s;es into valleys
beneath them; and &s;ome ochres of iron di&s;&s;olved and again depo&s;ited by water; and
&s;ome calcareous depo&s;itions from water, (as the bank for in&s;tance on which &s;tand the
hou&s;es at Matlock-bath;) but the&s;e are of &s;mall extent or con&s;equence compared to
the primitive rocks of granite or porpyhry which form the nucleus of the earth, or to
the immen&s;e &s;trata of lime&s;tone which cru&s;t over the greate&s;t part of this granite or
porphyry; or la&s;tly to the very exten&s;ive beds of clay, marl, &s;and&s;tone, coal, and iron,
<PB N="51" REF="280">
which were probably for many millions of years the only parts of our continents and
i&s;lands, which were then elevated above the level of the &s;ea, and which on that account
became covered with vegetation, and thence acquired their later or &s;uperincumbent
&s;trata, which con&s;titute, what &s;ome have termed, the new world.</P>
<P>There is another &s;ource of clay, and that of the fine&s;t kind, from decompo&s;ed
granite, this is of a &s;nowy white and mixed with &s;hining particles of mica, of this kind
is an earth from the country of Cherokees. Other kinds are from le&s;s pure lavas;
Mr. Ferber a&s;&s;erts that the &s;ulphurous &s;teams from Mount Ve&s;uvius convert the lava
into clay.</P>
<P><Q>The lavas of the antient Solfatara volcano have been undoubtedly of a vitreous
nature, and the&s;e appear at pre&s;ent argillaceous. Some fragments of this lava are but
half or at one &s;ide changed into clay, which either is vi&s;cid or ductile, or hard and
&s;toney. Clays by fire are deprived of their coherent quality, which cannot be re&s;tored
to them by pulverization, nor by humectation. But the &s;ulphureous Solfatara &s;teams
re&s;tore it, as may be ea&s;ily ob&s;erved on the broken pots wherein they gather the &s;al
ammoniac; though very well baked and burnt at Naples they are mollified again by the
acid &s;teams into a vi&s;cid clay which keeps the &s;ormer fire-burnt colour. <BIBL>Travels in

<Q><L>Smear'd her huge dragons with metallic hues,</L>
<L>With golden purples, and cobaltic blues; </L><BIBL>CANTO II l. 287.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE fine bright purples or ro&s;e colours which we &s;ee on china cups are not
producible with any other material except gold, mangane&s;e indeed gives a purple but of
a very different kind.</P>
<P>In Europe the application of gold to the&s;e purpo&s;es appears to be of modern invention.
Ca&s;&s;ius's di&s;covery of the precipitate of gold by tin, and the u&s;e of that precipitate for
colouring gla&s;s and enamels, are now generally known, but though the precipitate with
tin be more &s;ucce&s;&s;ful in producing the ruby gla&s;s, or the colourle&s;s gla&s;s which
becomes red by &s;ub&s;equent ignition, the tin probably contributing to prevent the gold
from &s;eparating, (which it is very liable to do during the fu&s;ion; yet, for enamels, the
precipitates made by alcaline &s;alts an&s;wer equally well, and give a finer red, the colour
produced by the tin precipitate being a blui&s;h purple, but with the others a ro&s;e red.
I am informed that &s;ome of our be&s;t arti&s;ts prefer aurum fulminans, mixing it, before
it has become dry, with the white compo&s;ition or enamel flux; when once it is divided
by the other matter, it is ground with great &s;afety, and without the lea&s;t danger of
explo&s;ion, whether moi&s;t or dry. The colour is remarkably improved and brought forth
by long grinding, which accordingly makes an e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tance in the proce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="281">
The precipitates of gold, and the colcothar or other red preparations of iron, are
called <HI>tender</HI> colours. The heat mu&s;t be no greater than is ju&s;t &s;ufficient to make the
enamel run upon the piece, for if greater, the colours will be de&s;troyed or changed to a
different kind. When the vitreous matter has ju&s;t become fluid it &s;eems as if the
coloured metallic calx remained barely <HI>intermixed</HI> with it, like a coloured powder of
exqui&s;ite tenuity &s;u&s;pended in water: but by &s;tronger fire the calx is <HI>di&s;&s;olved,</HI> and
metallic colours are altered by <HI>&s;olution</HI> in gla&s;s as well as in acids or alcalies.</P>
<P>The Saxon mines have till very lately almo&s;t exclu&s;ively &s;upplied the re&s;t of Europe
with cobalt, or rather with its preparations, zaffre and &s;malt, for the exportation of the
ore it&s;elf is there a capital crime. Hungary, Spain, Sweden, and &s;ome other parts of the
continent, are now &s;aid to afford cobalts equal to the Saxon, and &s;pecimens have been
di&s;covered in our own i&s;land, both in Cornwall and in Scotland; but hitherto in no
great quantity.</P>
<P>Calces of cobalt and of copper differ very materially from tho&s;e above mentioned in
their application for colouring enamels. In tho&s;e the calx has previou&s;ly acquired the
intended colour, a colour which bears a red heat without injury, and all that remains is
to fix it on the piece by a vitreous flux. But the blue colour of cobalt, and the green
or blui&s;h green of copper, are <HI>produced</HI> by vitrification, that is, by <HI>&s;olution</HI> in the gla&s;s, and
a &s;trong fire is nece&s;&s;ary for their perfection. The&s;e calces therefore, when mixed with
the enamel flux, are melted in crucibles, once or oftener, and the deep coloured opake
gla&s;s, thence re&s;ulting, is ground into unpalpable powder, and u&s;ed for enamel. One
part of either of the&s;e calces is put to ten, &s;ixteen, or twenty parts of the flux, according
to the depth of colour required. The heat of the enamel kiln is only a full red, &s;uch as
is marked on Mr. Wedgwood's thermometer 6 degrees. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary that
the flux be &s;o adju&s;ted as to melt in that low heat. The u&s;ual materials are flint, or
flint-gla&s;s, with a due proportion of red-led, or borax, or both, and &s;ometimes a little tin
calx to give opacity.</P>
<P><HI>Ka-o-lin</HI> is the name given by the Chine&s;e to their porcelain clay, and <HI>pe-tun-t&s;e</HI> to the
other ingredient in their China ware. Specimens of both the&s;e have been brought into
England, and found to agree in quality with &s;ome of our own materials. Kaolin is the
very &s;ame with the clay called in Cornwall and the petunt&s;e is a granite &s;imilar
to the Corni&s;h moor&s;tone. There are differences, both in the Chine&s;e petunt&s;es, and
the Engli&s;h moor&s;tones; all of them contain micaceous and quartzy particles, in greater
or le&s;s quantity, along with felt&s;pat, which la&s;t is the e&s;&s;ential ingredient for the
porcelain manufactory. The only injurious material commonly found in them is iron,
which di&s;colours the ware in proportion to its quantity, and which our moor&s;tones are
perhaps more frequently tainted with than the Chine&s;e. Very fine porcelain has been
made from Engli&s;h materials but the nature of the manufacture renders the proce&s;s pre|carious
and the profit hazardous; for the &s;emivitrification, which con&s;titutes porcelain,
is nece&s;&s;arily accompanied with a degree of &s;oftne&s;s, or &s;emifu&s;ion, &s;o that the ve&s;&s;els are
liable to have their forms altered in the kiln, or to run together with any accidental
augmentations of the fire.

<Q><L>Or bid Mortality rejoice or mourn</L>
<L>O'er the fine forms of Portland's my&s;tic urn. </L><BIBL>CANTO II. l 321.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE celebrated funereal va&s;e, long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Barberini family, and lately
purcha&s;ed by the Duke of Portland for a thou&s;and guineas, is about ten inches high and
&s;ix in diameter in the broade&s;t part. The figures are of mo&s;t exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip in
bas relief of white opake gla&s;s, rai&s;ed on a ground of deep blue gla&s;s, which appears
black except when held again&s;t the light. Mr. Wedgwood is of opinion from many
circum&s;tances that the figures have been made by cutting away the external cru&s;t of
white opake gla&s;s, in the manner the fine&s;t cameo's have been produced, and that it
mu&s;t thence have been the labour of a great many years. Some antiquarians have
placed the time of its production many centuries before the chri&s;tian aera; as &s;culpture
was &s;aid to have been declining in re&s;pect to its excellence in the time of Alexander the
Great. See an account of the Barberini or Portland va&s;e by M. D'Hancarville, and by
Mr. Wedgwood.</P>
<P>Many opinions and conjectures have been publi&s;hed concerning the figures on this
celebrated va&s;e. Having carefully examined one of Mr. Wedgwood's beautiful copies
of this wonderful production of art, I &s;hall add one more conjecture to the number.</P>
<P>Mr. Wedgwood has well ob&s;erved that it does not &s;eem probable that the Portland
va&s;e was purpo&s;ely made for the a&s;hes of any particular per&s;on decea&s;ed, becau&s;e many
years mu&s;t have been nece&s;&s;ary for its production. Hence it may be concluded, that the
&s;ubject of its embelli&s;hments is not private hi&s;tory but of a general nature. This &s;ubject
appears to me to be well cho&s;en, and the &s;tory to be finely told; and that it repre&s;ents
what in antient times engaged the attention of philo&s;ophers, poets, and heroes, I mean a
part of the Eleu&s;inian my&s;teries.</P>
<P>The&s;e my&s;teries were invented in Aegypt, and afterwards tran&s;ferred to Greece, and
flouri&s;hed more particularly at Athens, which was at the &s;ame time the &s;eat of the fine
arts. They con&s;i&s;ted of &s;cenical exhibitions repre&s;enting and inculcating the expectation
of a future life after death, and on this account were encouraged by the government,
in&s;omuch that the Athenian laws puni&s;hed a di&s;covery of their &s;ecrets with death.
Dr. Warburton has with great learning and ingenuity &s;hewn that the de&s;cent of Aeneas
into hell, de&s;cribed in the Sixth Book of Virgil, is a poetical account of the repre&s;en|tations
of the future &s;tate in the Eleu&s;inian my&s;teries. Divine Legation, Vol. I. p, 210.</P>
<P>And though &s;ome writers have differed in opinion from Dr. Warburton on this
&s;ubject, becau&s;e Virgil has introduced &s;ome of his own heroes into the Ely&s;ian fields, as
Deiphobus, Palinurus, and Dido, in the &s;ame manner as Homer had done before him,
yet it is agreed that the received notions about a future &s;tate were exhibited in the&s;e
my&s;teries, and as the&s;e poets de&s;cribed tho&s;e received notions, they may be &s;aid, as far as
the&s;e religious doctrines were concerned, to have de&s;cribed the my&s;teries.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="284">
Now as the&s;e were emblematic exhibitions they mu&s;t have been as well adapted to
the purpo&s;es of &s;culpture as of poetry, which indeed does not &s;eem to have been un|common,
&s;ince one compartment of figures in the &s;heild of Aeneas repre&s;ented the regions
of Tartarus. Aen. Lib. X. The proce&s;&s;ion of torches, which according to M. De St.
Croix was exhibited in the&s;e my&s;teries, is &s;till to be &s;een in ba&s;&s;o relievo, di&s;covered by
Spon and Wheler. Memoires &s;ur le My&s;teres par De St. Croix. 1784. And it is very
probable that the beautiful gem repre&s;enting the marriage of Cupid and P&s;yche, as de|&s;cribed
by Apulcus, was originally de&s;criptive of another part of the exhibitions in the&s;e
my&s;teries, though afterwards it became a common &s;ubject of antient art. See Divine
Legat. Vol. I. p. 323. What &s;ubject could have been imagined &s;o &s;ublime for the
ornaments of a funereal urn as the mortality of all things and their re&s;u&s;citation? Where
could the de&s;igner be &s;upplied with emblems for this purpo&s;e, before the Chri&s;tian aera,
but from the Eleu&s;inian my&s;teries?</P>
<P>1. The exhibitions of the my&s;teries were of two kinds, tho&s;e which the people were
permitted to &s;ee, and tho&s;e which were only &s;hewn to the initiated. Concerning the
latter, Ari&s;tides calls them  <Q>the mo&s;t &s;hocking and mo&s;t ravi&s;hing repre&s;entations.</Q> And
Stoboeus a&s;&s;erts that the initiation into the grand my&s;teries exactly re&s;embles death.
Divine Legat. Vol. I. p. 280, and p. 272. And Virgil in his entrance to the &s;hades
below, among&s;t other things of terrible form, mentions death. Aen. VI. This part of
the exhibition &s;eems to be repre&s;ented in one of the compartments of the Portland
va&s;e.</P>
<P>Three figures of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip are placed by the &s;ide of a ruined column
who&s;e capital is fallen off, and lies at their feet with other di&s;jointed &s;tones, they &s;it on
loo&s;e piles of &s;tone beneath a tree, which has not the leaves of any evergreen of this
climate, but may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be an elm, which Virgil places near the entrance of the
infernal regions, and adds, that a dream was believed to dwell under every leaf of it.
Aen. VI. l. 281. In the mid&s;t of this group reclines a female figure in a dying attitude,
in which extreme languor is beautifully repre&s;ented, in her hand is an inverted torch, an
antient emblem of extingui&s;hed life, the elbow of the &s;ame arm re&s;ting on a &s;tone &s;upports
her as &s;he &s;inks, while the other hand is rai&s;ed and thrown over her drooping head, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure &s;u&s;taining it and gives with great art the idea of fainting la&s;&s;itude. On
the right of her &s;its a man, and on the left a woman, both &s;upporting them&s;elves on their
arms, as people are liable to do when they are thinking inten&s;ely. They have their
backs towards the dying figure, yet with their faces turned towards her, as if &s;eriou&s;ly
contemplating her &s;ituation, but without &s;tretching out their hands to a&s;&s;i&s;t her.</P>
<P>This central figure then appears to me to be an hieroglyphic or Eleu&s;inian emblem of
MORTAL LIFF, that is, the lethum, or death, mentioned by Virgil among&s;t the terrible
things exhibited at the beginning of the my&s;teries. The inverted torch &s;hews the
figure to be emblematic, if it had been de&s;igned to repre&s;ent a real per&s;on in the act of
dying there had been no nece&s;&s;ity for the expiring torch, as the dying figure alone would
have been &s;ufficiently intelligible;&mdash;it would have been as ab&s;urd as to have put an
inverted torch into the hand of a real per&s;on at the time of his expiring. Be&s;ides if this

figure had repre&s;ented a real dying per&s;on would not the other figures, or one of them at
lea&s;t, have &s;tretched out a hand to &s;upport her, to have ea&s;ed her fall among loo&s;e &s;tones,
or to have &s;moothed her pillow? The&s;e circum&s;tances evince that the figure is an
emblem, and therefore could not be a repre&s;entation of the private hi&s;tory of any par|ticular
family or event.</P>
<P>The man and woman on each &s;ide of the dying figure mu&s;t be con&s;idered as emblems,
both from their &s;imilarity of &s;ituation and dre&s;s to the middle figure, and their being
grouped along with it. The&s;e I think are hieroglyphic or Eleu&s;inian emblems of
HUMANKIND, with their backs toward the dying figure of MORTAL LIFE, unwilling to
a&s;&s;ociate with her, yet turning back their &s;erious and attentive countenances, curious
indeed to behold, yet &s;orry to contemplate their latter end. The&s;e figures bring &s;trongly
to one's mind the Adam and Eve of &s;acred writ, whom &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed to have
been allegorical or hieroglyphic per&s;ons of Aegyptian origin, but of more antient date,
among&s;t whom I think is Dr. Warburton. According to this opinion Adam and Eve
were the names of two hieroglyphic figures repre&s;enting the early &s;tate of mankind;
Abel was the name of an hieroglyphic figure repre&s;enting the age of pa&s;turage, and Cain
the name of another hieroglyphic &s;ymbol repre&s;enting the age of agriculture, at which
time the u&s;es of iron were di&s;covered. And as the people who cultivated the earth and
built hou&s;es would increa&s;e in numbers much fa&s;ter by their greater production of food,
they would readily conquer or de&s;troy the people who were &s;u&s;tained by pa&s;turage, which
was typified by Cain &s;laying Abel.</P>
<P>2. On the other compartment of this celebrated va&s;e is exhibited an emblem of
immortality, the repre&s;entation of which was well known to con&s;titute a very principal
part of the &s;hews at the Eleu&s;inian my&s;teries, as Dr. Warburton has proved by variety
of authority. The habitation of &s;pirits or gho&s;ts after death was &s;uppo&s;ed by the
antients to be placed beneath the earth, where Pluto reigned, and di&s;pen&s;ed rewards or
puni&s;hments. Hence the fir&s;t figure in this group is of the MANES or GHOST, who
having pa&s;&s;ed through an open portal is de&s;cending into a du&s;ky region, pointing his
toe with timid and un&s;teady &s;tep, feeling as it were his way in the gloom. This portal
Aeneas enters, which is de&s;cribed by Virgil,&mdash;patet atri janua ditis, Aen. VI. l. 126; as
well as the ea&s;y de&s;cent,&mdash;facilis de&s;cen&s;us Averni. Ib. The darkne&s;s at the entrance
to the &s;hades is humorou&s;ly de&s;cribed by Lucian. Div. Legat. Vol. I. p. 241. And the
horror of the gates of hell was in the time of Homer become a proverb; Achilles &s;ays
to Uly&s;&s;es, "I hate a liar wor&s;e than the gates of hell;" the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion is u&s;ed in
I&s;aiah, ch. xxxviii. v. 10. The MANES or GHOST appears lingering and fearful, and
wi&s;hes to drag after him a part of his mortal garment, which however adheres to the
&s;ide of the portal through which he has pa&s;&s;ed. The beauty of this allegory would have
been expre&s;&s;ed by Mr. Pope, by "We feel the ruling pa&s;&s;ion &s;trong in death."</P>
<P>A little lower down in the group the manes or gho&s;t is received by a beautiful female,
a &s;ymbol of IMMORTAL LIFE. This is evinced by her fondling between her knees a
large and playful &s;erpent, which from its annually renewing its external &s;kin has from
great antiquity, even as early as the fable of Prometheus, been e&s;teemed an emblem of
<PB N="56" REF="288">
renovated youth. The &s;tory of the &s;erpent acquiring immortal life from the a&s;s of
Prometheus, who carried it on his back, is told in Bacon's Works, Vol. V. p. 462.
Quarto edit. Lond. 1778. For a &s;imilar purpo&s;e a &s;erpent was wrapped round the
large hieroglyphic egg in the temple of Dio&s;curi, as an emblem of the renewal of life
from a &s;tate of death. Bryant's Mythology, Vol II. p. 359. &s;ec. edit. On this account
al&s;o the &s;erpent was an attendant on Ae&s;culapius, which &s;eems to have been the name of
the hieroglyphic figure of medicine. This &s;erpent &s;hews this figure to be an emblem,
as the torch &s;hewed the central figure of the other compartment to be an emblem, hence
they agreeably corre&s;pond, and explain each other, one repre&s;enting MORTAL LIFE, and
the other IMMORTAL LIFE.</P>
<P>This emblematic figure of immortal life &s;its down with her feet towards the figure of
Pluto, but, turning back her face towards the timid gho&s;t, &s;he &s;tretches forth her hand,
and taking hold of his elbow, &s;upports his tottering &s;teps, as well as encourages him to
advance, both which circum&s;tances are thus with wonderful ingenuity brought to the
eye. At the &s;ame time the &s;pirit loo&s;ely lays his hand upon her arm, as one walking in
the dark would naturally do for the greater certainty of following his conductre&s;s, while
the general part of the &s;ymbol of IMMORTAL LIFE, being turned toward the figure of
Pluto, &s;hews that &s;he is leading the phantom to his realms.</P>
<P>In the Pamphili gardens at Rome, Per&s;eus in a&s;&s;i&s;ting Andromeda to de&s;cend from the
rock takes hold of her elbow to &s;teady or &s;upport her &s;tep, and &s;he lays her hand loo&s;ely
on his arm as in this figure. Admir. Roman. Antiq.</P>
<P>The figure of PLUTO can not be mi&s;taken, as is agreed by mo&s;t of the writers who
have mentioned this va&s;e; his gri&s;ley beard, and his having one foot buried in the earth,
denotes the infernal monarch. He is placed at the lowe&s;t part of the group, and re&s;ting
his chin on his hand, and his arm upon his knee, receives the &s;tranger-&s;pirit with
inqui&s;itive attention; it was before ob&s;erved that when people think attentively they
naturally re&s;t their bodies in &s;ome ea&s;y attitude, that more animal power may be employed
on the thinking faculty. In this group of figures there is great art &s;hewn in giving an
idea of a de&s;cending plain, viz. from earth to Ely&s;ium, and yet all the figures are in
reality on an horizontal one. This wonderful deception is produced fir&s;t by the de&s;cend|ing
&s;tep of the manes or gho&s;t; &s;econdly, by the arm of the &s;itting figure of immortal life
being rai&s;ed up to receive him as he de&s;cends; and la&s;tly, by Pluto having one foot
&s;unk into the earth.</P>
<P>There is yet another figure which is concerned in conducting the manes or gho&s;t to
the realms of Pluto, and this is LOVE. He precedes the de&s;cending &s;pirit on expanded
wings, lights him with his torch, and turning back his beautiful countenance beckons
him to advance. The antient God of love was of much higher dignity than the modern
Cupid. He was the fir&s;t that came out of the great egg of night, (He&s;iod. Theog.
V. CXX. Bryant's Mythol. Vol. II. p. 348.) and is &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s the keys of the
&s;ky, &s;ea, and earth. As he therefore led the way into this life, he &s;eems to con&s;titute a
proper emblem for leading the way to a &s;uture life. See Bacon's works. Vol. I. p. 568.
and Vol. III. p. 582. Quarto edit.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="289">
The introduction of love into this part of the my&s;teries requires a little further expla|nation.
The P&s;yche of the Aegyptians was one of their mo&s;t favourite emblems, and
repre&s;ented the &s;oul, or a future life; it was originally no other than the aurelia, or
butterfly, but in after times was repre&s;ented by a lovely female child with the beautiful
wings of that in&s;ect. The aurelia, after its fir&s;t &s;tage as an eruca or caterpillar, lies for
a &s;ea&s;on in a manner dead, and is inclo&s;ed in a &s;ort of coffin, in this &s;tate of darkne&s;s it
remains all the winter, but at the return of &s;pring it bur&s;ts its bonds and comes out
with new life, and in the mo&s;t beautiful attire. The Aegyptians thought this a very
proper picture of the &s;oul of man, and of the immortality to which it a&s;pired. But as
this was all owing to divine Love, of which EROS was an emblem, we find this per&s;on
frequently introduced as a concomitant of the &s;oul in general or P&s;yche. (Bryant's
Mythol. Vol. II. p. 386.) EROS, or divine Love, is for the &s;ame rea&s;on a proper attendant
on the manes or &s;oul after death, and much contributes to tell the &s;tory, that is, to
&s;hew that a &s;oul or manes is de&s;igned by the de&s;cending figure. From this figure of
Love M. D'Hancarville imagines that Orpheus and Eurydice are typified under the
figure of the manes and immortal life as above de&s;cribed. It may be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer,
fir&s;t, that Orpheus is always repre&s;ented with a lyre, of which there are prints of four
different gems in Spence's Polymetis, and Virgil &s;o de&s;cribes him, Aen. VI. cythar&acirc;.
fretus. And &s;econdly, that it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that Eurydice was fondling and
playing with a &s;erpent that had &s;lain her. Add to this that Love &s;eems to have been an
inhabitant of the infernal regions, as exhibited in the my&s;teries, for Claudian, who
treats more openly of the Eleu&s;inian my&s;teries, when they were held in le&s;s veneration,
invokes the deities to di&s;clo&s;e to him their &s;ecrets, and among&s;t other things by what
torch Love &s;oftens Pluto.</P>

<P>In this compartment there are two trees, who&s;e branches &s;pread over the figures,
one of them has &s;moother leaves like &s;ome evergreens, and might thence be &s;uppo&s;ed to
have &s;ome allu&s;ion to immortality, but they may perhaps have been de&s;igned only as
ornaments, or to relieve the figures, or becau&s;e it was in groves, where the&s;e my&s;teries
were originally celebrated. Thus Homer &s;peaks of the woods of Pro&s;erpine, and
mentions many trees in Tartarus, as pre&s;enting their fruits to Tantalus; Virgil &s;peaks
of the plea&s;ant groves of Ely&s;ium; and in Spence's Polymetis there are prints of two
antient gems, one of Orpheus charming Cerberus with his lyre, and the other of Hercules
binding him in a cord, each of them &s;tanding by a tree. Polymet. p. 284. As however
the&s;e trees have all different foliage &s;o clearly marked by the arti&s;t, they may have had
&s;pecific meanings in the exhibitions of the my&s;teries, which have not reached po&s;terity,
of this kind &s;eem to have been the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and the tree of
life, in &s;acred writ, both which mu&s;t have been emblematic or allegorical. The ma&s;ks,
<PB N="58" REF="290">
hanging to the handles of the va&s;e, &s;eem to indicate that there is a concealed meaning in
the figures be&s;ides their general appearance. And the prie&s;te&s;s at the bottom, which I
come now to de&s;cribe, &s;eems to &s;hew this concealed meaning to be of the &s;acred or
Eleu&s;inian kind.</P>
<P>3. The figure on the bottom of the va&s;e is on a larger &s;cale than the others, and le&s;s
finely fini&s;hed, and le&s;s elevated, and as this bottom part was afterwards cemented to the
upper part, it might be executed by another arti&s;t for the &s;ake of expedition, but there
&s;eems no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that it was not originally de&s;igned for the upper part of it as
&s;ome have conjectured. As the my&s;teries of Ceres were celebrated by female prie&s;ts, for
Porphyrius &s;ays the antients called the prie&s;te&s;&s;es of Ceres, Meli&s;&s;ai, or bees, which were
emblems of cha&s;tity. Div. Leg. Vol. I. p. 235. And as, in his Satire again&s;t the &s;ex,
Juvenal &s;ays, that few women are worthy to be prie&s;te&s;&s;es of Ceres. Sat. VI. the figure
at the bottom of the va&s;e would &s;eem to repre&s;ent a PRIESTESS or HIEROPHANT, who&s;e
office it was to introduce the initiated, and point out to them, and explain the
exhibitions in the my&s;teries, and to exclude the uninitiated, calling out to them, " Far,
far retire, ye profane!" and to guard the &s;ecrets of the temple. Thus the introductory
hymn &s;ung by the hierophant, according to Eu&s;ebius, begins, "I will declare a &s;ecret to
the initiated, but let the doors be &s;hut again&s;t the profane." Div. Leg. Vol. I. p. 177.
The prie&s;te&s;s or hierophant appears in this figure with a clo&s;e hood, and dre&s;&s;ed in linen,
which &s;its clo&s;e about her; except a light cloak, which flutters in the wind. Wool,
as taken from &s;laughtered animals, was e&s;teemed profane by the prie&s;ts of Aegypt, who
were always dre&s;&s;ed in linen. Apuleus, p. 64. Div. Leg. Vol. I. p. 318. Thus Eli
made for Samuel a linen ephod. Samuel i. 3.</P>
<P>Secrecy was the foundation on which all my&s;teries re&s;ted, when publicly known they
cea&s;ed to be my&s;teries; hence a di&s;covery of them was not only puni&s;hed with death by
the Athenian law; but in other countries a di&s;grace attended the breach of a &s;olemn
oath. The prie&s;te&s;s in the figure before us has her finger pointing to her lips as an
emblem of &s;ilence. There is a figure of Harpocrates, who was of Aegyptian origin, the
&s;ame as Orus, with the lotus on his head, and with his finger pointing to his lips not
pre&s;&s;ed upon them, in Bryant's Mythol. Vol. II. p. 398, and another female figure
&s;tanding on a lotus, as if ju&s;t ri&s;en from the Nile, with her finger in the &s;ame attitude,
the&s;e &s;eem to have been repre&s;entations or emblems of male and female prie&s;ts of
the &s;ecret my&s;teries. As the&s;e &s;ort of emblems were frequently changed by arti&s;ts for
their more elegant exhibition, it is po&s;&s;ible the foliage over the head of this figure may
bear &s;ome analogy to the lotus above mentioned.</P>
<P>This figure of &s;ecrecy &s;eems to be here placed, with great ingenuity, as a caution to
the initiated, who might under&s;tand the meaning of the emblems round the va&s;e, not
to divulge it. And this circum&s;tance &s;eems to account for there being no written ex|planation
extant, and no tradition concerning the&s;e beautiful figures handed down to us
along with them.</P>
<P>Another explanation of this figure at the bottom of the va&s;e would &s;eem to confirm
the idea that the ba&s;&s;o relievos round its &s;ides are repre&s;entations of a part of the

my&s;teries, I mean that it is the head of ATIS. Lucian &s;ays that Atis was a young man
of Phrygia, of uncommon beauty, that he dedicated a temple in Syria to Rhea, or
Cybele, and fir&s;t taught her my&s;teries to the Lydians, Phrygians, and Samothracians,
which my&s;teries he brought from India. He was afterwards made an eunuch by Rhea,
and lived like a woman, and a&s;&s;umed a feminine habit, and in that garb went over the
world teaching her ceremonies and my&s;teries. Dict. par M. Danet, art. Atis. As this
figure is covered with clothes, while tho&s;e on the &s;ides of the va&s;e are naked, and has a
Phrygian cap on the head, and as the form and features are &s;o &s;oft, that it is difficult to
&s;ay whether it be a male or female figure, there is rea&s;on to conclude, 1. that it has
reference to &s;ome particular per&s;on of &s;ome particular country; 2. that this per&s;on is
Atis, the fir&s;t great hierophant, or teacher of my&s;teries, to whom M. De la Chau&s;&s;e &s;ays
the figure it&s;elf bears a re&s;emblance. Mu&s;eo. Capitol. Tom. IV. p. 402.</P>
<P>In the Mu&s;eum Etru&s;cum, Vol. I. plate 96, there is the head of Atis with feminine
features, clothed with a Phrygian cap, and ri&s;ing from very broad foliage, placed on a
kind of term &s;upported by the paw of a lion. Goreus in his explanation of the figure
&s;ays that it is placed on a lion's foot becau&s;e that animal was &s;acred to Cybele, and that
it ri&s;es from very broad leaves becau&s;e after he became an eunuch he determined to
dwell in the groves. Thus the foliage, as well as the cap and feminine features, confirm
the idea of this figure at the bottom of the va&s;e repre&s;enting the head of Atis the fir&s;t
great hierophant, and that the figures on the &s;ides of the va&s;e are emblems from the
antient my&s;teries.</P>
<P>I beg leave to add that it does not appear to have been uncommon among&s;t the
antients to put allegorical figures on funeral va&s;es. In the Pamphili palace at Rome
there is an elaborate repre&s;entation of Life and of Death, on an antient &s;arcophagus. In
the fir&s;t Prometheus is repre&s;ented making man, and Minerva is placing a butterfly, or
the foul, upon his head. In the other compartment Love extingui&s;hes his torch in the
bo&s;om of the dying figure, and is receiving the butterfly, or P&s;yche, from him, with a
great number of complicated emblematic figures grouped in very bad ta&s;te. Admir.

<Q><L>Whence &s;able Coal his ma&s;&s;y couch extends,</L>
<L>And &s;tars of gold the &s;parkling Pyrite blends. </L><BIBL>CANTO II. l. 349.</BIBL></Q>
<P>TO elucidate the formation of coal-beds I &s;hall here de&s;cribe a fountain of fo&s;&s;il tar,
or petroleum, di&s;covered lately near Colebrook Dale in Shrop&s;hire, the particulars of
which were &s;ent me by Dr. Robert Darwin of Shrew&s;bury.</P>
<P>About a mile and a half below the celebrated iron-bridge, con&s;tructed by the late
Mr. DARBY near Colebrook Dale, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river Severn, as the workmen
in October 1786 were making a &s;ubterranean canal into the mountain, for the more
ea&s;y acqui&s;ition and conveyance of the coals which lie under it, they found an oozing of
liquid bitumen, or petroleum; and as they proceeded further cut through &s;mall cavities
of different &s;izes from which the bitumen i&s;&s;ued. From ten to fifteen barrels of this
fo&s;&s;il tar, each barrel containing thirty-two gallons, were at fir&s;t collected in a day,
which has &s;ince however gradually dimini&s;hed in quantity, &s;o that at pre&s;ent the product
is about &s;even barrels in fourteen days.</P>
<P>The mountain, into which this canal enters, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;iliceous &s;and, in which
however a few marine productions, apparently in their recent &s;tate, have been found,
and are now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. WILLIAM REYNOLDS of Ketly Bank. About
three hundred yards from the entrance into the mountain, and about twenty-eight yards
below the &s;urface of it, the tar is found oozing from the &s;and-rock above into the top
and &s;ides of the canal.</P>
<P>Beneath the level of this canal a &s;haft has been &s;unk through a grey argillaceous
&s;ub&s;tance, called in this country clunch, which is &s;aid to be a pretty certain indication
of coal; beneath this lies a &s;tratum of coal, about two or three inches thick, of an
inferior kind, yielding little flame in burning, and leaving much a&s;hes; below this is a
rock of a harder texture; and beneath this are found coals of an excellent quality; for
the purpo&s;e of procuring which with greater facility the canal, or horizontal aperture, is
now making into the mountain. July, 1788.</P>
<P>Beneath the&s;e coals in &s;ome places is found &s;alt water, in other parts of the adjacent
country there are beds of iron-&s;tone, which al&s;o contain &s;ome bitumen in a le&s;s fluid
&s;tate, and which are about on a level with the new canal, into which the fo&s;&s;il tar oozes,
as above de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>There are many intere&s;ting circum&s;tances attending the &s;ituation and accompaniments
of this fountain of fo&s;&s;il tar, tending to develop the manner of its production. 1. As the
canal pa&s;&s;ing into the mountain runs over the beds of coals, and under the re&s;ervoir
of petroleum, it appears that a <HI>natural di&s;tillation</HI> of this fo&s;&s;il in the bowels of the earth
mu&s;t have taken place at &s;ome early period of the world, &s;imilar to the artificial di&s;tillation
<PB N="61" REF="294">
of coal, which has many years been carried on in this place on a &s;maller &s;cale above
ground. When this re&s;ervoir of petroleum was cut into, the &s;lowne&s;s of its ex&s;udation
into the canal was not only owing to its vi&s;cidity, but to the pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere,
or to the nece&s;&s;ity there was that air &s;hould at the &s;ame time in&s;inuate it&s;elf into the &s;mall
cavities from which the petroleum de&s;cended. The exi&s;tence of &s;uch a di&s;tillation at
&s;ome antient time is confirmed by the thin &s;tratum of coal beneath the canal, (which
covers the hard rock,) having been deprived of its fo&s;&s;il oil, &s;o as to burn without flame,
and thus to have become a natural coak, or fo&s;&s;il charcoal, while the petroleum di&s;tilled
from it is found in the cavities of the rock above it.</P>
<P>There are appearances in other places, which favour this idea of the natural di&s;tillation
of petroleum, thus at Matlock in Derby&s;hire a hard bitumen is found adhering to the
&s;par in the clefts of the lime-rocks in the form of round drops about the &s;ize of peas;
which could perhaps only be depo&s;ited there in that form by &s;ublimation.</P>
<P>2. The &s;econd deduction, which offers it&s;elf, is, that the&s;e beds of coal have been
<HI>expo&s;ed to a con&s;iderable degree of heat,</HI> &s;ince the petroleum above could not be &s;eparated,
as far as we know, by any other means, and that the good quality of the coals beneath
the hard rock was owing to the impermeability of this rock to the bituminous vapour,
and to its pre&s;&s;ure being too great to permit its being removed by the ela&s;ticity of that
vapour. Thus from the degree of heat, the degree of pre&s;&s;ure, and the permeability of
the &s;uperincumbent &s;trata, many of the phenomena attending coal-beds receive an ea&s;y
explanation, which much accords with the ingenious theory of the earth by Dr. Hutton.
Trans. of Edinb. Vol. I.</P>
<P>In &s;ome coal works the fu&s;ion of the &s;trata of coal has been &s;o &s;light, that there
remains the appearance of ligneus fibres, and the impre&s;&s;ion of leaves, as at Bovey near
Exeter, and even &s;eeds of vegetables, of which I have had &s;pecimens from the collieries
near Pole&s;worth in Warwick&s;hire. In &s;ome, where the heat was not very inten&s;e and
the incumbent &s;tratum not permeable to vapour, the fo&s;&s;il oil has only ri&s;en to the
upper part of the coal-bed, and has rendered that much more inflammable than the
lower parts of it, as in the collieries near Beaude&s;ert, the &s;eat of the EARL OF UXBRIDGE
in Stafford&s;hire, where the upper &s;tratum is a perfect cannel, or candle-coal, and the
lower one of an inferior quality. Over the coal-beds near Sir H. HARPUR's hou&s;e in
Derby&s;hire a thin lamina of a&s;phaltum is found in &s;ome places near the &s;urface of the
earth, which would &s;eem to be from a di&s;tillation of petroleum from the coals below,
the more fluid part of which had in proce&s;s of time exhaled, or been con&s;olidated by its
ab&s;orption of air. In other coal-works the upper part of the &s;tratum is of a wor&s;e kind
than the lower one, as at Alfreton and Denbigh in Derby&s;hire, owing to the &s;uper|cumbent
&s;tratum having permitted the exhalation of a great part of the petroleum;
whil&s;t at Widdrington in Northumberland there is fir&s;t a &s;eam of coal about &s;ix inches
thick of no value, which lies under about four fathom of clay, beneath this is a white
free&s;tone, then a hard &s;tone, which the workmen there call a whin, then two fathoms
of clay, then another white &s;tone, and under that a vein of coals three feet nine inches
<PB N="62" REF="295">
thick, of a &s;imilar nature to the Newca&s;tle coal. Phil. Trans. Abridg. Vol. VI. plate II.
p. 192. The &s;imilitude between the circum&s;tances of this colliery, and of the coal
beneath the fountain of tar above de&s;cribed, renders it highly probable that this upper
thin &s;eam of coal has &s;uffered a &s;imilar di&s;tillation, and that the inflammable part of it
had either been received into the clay above in the form of &s;ulphur, which when burnt
in the open air would produce alum; or had been di&s;&s;ipated for want of a receiver,
where it could be conden&s;ed. The former opinion is perhaps in this cafe more probable
as in &s;ome other coal-beds, of which I have procured accounts, the &s;urface of the coal
beneath clunch or clay is of an inferior quality, as at We&s;t Hallum in Nottingham&s;hire.
The clunch probably from hence acquires its inflammable part, which on calcination
becomes vitriolic acid. I gathered pieces of clunch converted partially into alum at a
colliery near Bil&s;ton, where the ground was &s;till on fire a few years ago.</P>
<P>The heat, which has thus pervaded the beds of mora&s;s, &s;eems to have been the
effect of the fermentation of their vegetable materials; as new hay &s;ometimes takes fire
even in &s;uch very &s;mall ma&s;&s;es from the &s;ugar it contains, and &s;eems hence not to have
been attended with any expul&s;ion of lava, like the deeper craters of volcanos &s;ituated in
beds of granite.</P>
<P>3. The marine &s;hells found in the loo&s;e &s;and-rock above this re&s;ervoir of petroleum,
and the coal-beds beneath it, together with the exi&s;tence of &s;ea-&s;alt beneath the&s;e coals,
prove that the&s;e coal beds have been <HI>at the bottom of the &s;ea,</HI> during &s;ome remote period
of time, and were afterwards rai&s;ed into their pre&s;ent &s;ituation by &s;ubterraneous expan|&s;ions
of vapour. This doctrine is further &s;upported by the marks of violence, which
&s;ome coal-beds received at the time they were rai&s;ed out of the &s;ea, as in the collieries at
Mendip in Somer&s;et&s;hire. In the&s;e there are &s;even &s;trata of coals, equitant upon each
other, with beds of clay and &s;tone intervening; among&s;t which clay are found &s;hells and
fern branches. In one part of this hill the &s;trata are di&s;joined, and a quantity of
heterogeneous &s;ub&s;tances fill up the cha&s;m which di&s;joins them, on one &s;ide of this
cha&s;m the &s;even &s;trata of coal are &s;een corre&s;ponding in re&s;pect to their reciprocal thick|ne&s;s
and goodne&s;s with the &s;even &s;trata on the other &s;ide of the cavity, except that they
have been elevated &s;everal yards higher. Phil. Tran&s;. No. 360. abridg. Vol. V. p. 237.</P>
<P>The cracks in the coal-bed near Ticknall in Derby&s;hire, and in the &s;and-&s;tone rock
over it, in both of which &s;pecimens of lead-ore and &s;par are found, confirm this opinion
of their having been forcibly rai&s;ed up by &s;ubterraneous fires. Over the colliery at
Brown-hills near Lichfield, there is a &s;tratum of gravel on the &s;urface of the ground;
which may be adduced as another proof to &s;hew that tho&s;e coals had &s;ome time been
beneath the &s;ea, or the bed of a river. Neverthele&s;s, the&s;e arguments only apply to the
collieries above mentioned, which are few compared with tho&s;e which bear no marks of
having been immer&s;ed in the &s;ea.</P>
<P>On the other hand the production of coals from mora&s;&s;es, as de&s;cribed in note XX.
is evinced from the vegetable matters frequently found in them, and in the &s;trata over
them; as fern-leaves in nodules of iron-ore, and from the bog-&s;hells or fre&s;h water
<PB N="63" REF="296">
mu&s;cles &s;ometimes found over them, of both which I have what I believe to be &s;peci|mens;
and is further proved from &s;ome parts of the&s;e beds being only in part trans|formed
to coal; and the other part &s;till retaining not only the form, but &s;ome of the
properties of wood; &s;pecimens of which are not unfrequent in the cabinets of the curious,
procured from Loch Neigh in Ireland, from Bovey near Exeter, and other places; and
from a famous cavern called the Temple of the Devil, near the town of Altorf in Fran|conia,
at the foot of a mountain covered with pine and &s;avine, in which are found large
coals re&s;embling trees of ebony; which are &s;o far mineralized as to be heavy and com|pact;
and &s;o to efflore&s;ce with pyrites in &s;ome parts as to crumble to pieces; yet from
other parts white a&s;hes are produced on calcination, from which <HI>fixed alcali</HI> is procured;
which evinces their vegetable origin. (Dict. Rai&s;onn&eacute;, art. Charbon.) To the&s;e may
be added another argument from the oil which is di&s;tilled from coals, and which is
analogous to vegetable oil, and does not exi&s;t in any bodies truly mineral. Keir's
Chemical Dictionary, art. Bitumen.</P>
<P>Whence it would appear, that though mo&s;t collieries with their attendant &s;trata
of clay, &s;and-&s;tone, and iron, were formed on the places where the vegetables grew,
from which they had their origin; yet that other collections of vegetable matter were
wa&s;hed down from eminences by currents of waters into the beds of rivers, or the
neighbouring &s;eas, and were there accumulated at different periods of time, and under|went
a great degree of heat from their fermentation, in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e beds
of mora&s;s which had continued on the plains where they were produced. And that by
this fermentation many of them had been rai&s;ed from the ocean with &s;and and &s;ea-&s;hells
over them; and others from the beds of rivers with accumulations of gravel upon them.</P>

Newca&s;tle. If the&s;e parts of the compo&s;ition be le&s;s di&s;tinct, or if only two of them be
vi&s;ible to the eye, it is termed porphyry, trap, whin&s;tone, moor&s;tone, &s;late. And if it
appears in a regular angular form, it is called ba&s;altes. The affinity of the&s;e bodies has
lately been further well e&s;tabli&s;hed by Dr. Beddoes in the Phil. Tran&s;. Vol. LXXX.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all e&s;teemed to have been volcanic productions that have undergone different
degrees of heat; it is well known that in Papin's dige&s;ter water may be made red hot by
confinement, and will then di&s;&s;olve many bodies which otherwi&s;e are little or not at all
acted upon by it. From hence it may be conceived, that under immen&s;e pre&s;&s;ure of
&s;uperincumbent materials, and by great heat, the&s;e ma&s;&s;es of lava may have undergone
a kind of aqueous &s;olution, without any tendency to vitrification, and might thence have
a power of cry&s;tallization, whence all the varieties above mentioned from the different
proportion of the materials, or the different degrees of heat they may have undergone in
this aqueous &s;olution. And that the uniformity of the mixture of the original earths,
as of lime, argil, &s;ilex, magne&s;ia, and barytes, which they contain, was owing to their
boiling together a longer or &s;horter time before their elevation into mountains. See
note XIX. art. 8.</P>
<P>The &s;eat of volcanos &s;eems to be principally, if not entirely, in the&s;e &s;trata of granite;

All the lavas from Ve&s;uvius contain one fourth part of iron, (Kirwan's Min.) and
all the five primitive earths, viz. calcareous, argillaceous, &s;iliceous, barytic, and magne&s;ian
earths, which are al&s;o evidently produced now daily from the recrements of animal and
vegetable bodies. What is to be thence concluded? Has the granite &s;tratum in very
antient times been produced like the pre&s;ent calcareous and &s;iliceous ma&s;&s;es, according
to the ingenious theory of Dr. Hutton, who &s;ays new continents are now forming at the
bottom of the &s;ea to ri&s;e in their turn, and that thus the terraqueous globe has been,
and will be, eternal? Or &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e that this internal heated ma&s;s of granite,
which forms the nucleus of the earth, was a part of the body of the &s;un before it was
&s;eparated by an explo&s;ion? Or was the fun originally a planet, inhabited like ours, and a
&s;atellite to &s;ome other greater fun, which has long been extingui&s;hed by diffu&s;ion of its
light, and around which the pre&s;ent &s;un continues to revolve, according to a conjecture
of the celebrated Mr. Her&s;chell, and which conveys to the mind a mo&s;t &s;ublime idea
of the progre&s;&s;ive and increa&s;ing excellence of the works of the Creator of all things?</P>
<P>For the more ea&s;y comprehen&s;ion of the facts and conjectures concerning the &s;ituation
and production of the various &s;trata of the earth, I &s;hall here &s;ubjoin a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ection
of the globe, but without any attempt to give the proportions of the parts, or the
number of them, but only their re&s;pective &s;ituation over each other, and a geological
recapitulation.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>GEOLOGICAL RECAPITULATION.</HEAD>
<P>1. The earth was projected along with the other primary planets from the &s;un,
which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be on fire only on its &s;urface, emitting light without much internal
heat like a ball of burning camphor.</P>
<P>2. The rotation of the earth round its axis was occa&s;ioned by its greater friction or
adhe&s;ion to one &s;ide of the cavity from which it was ejected; and from this rotation it
acquired its &s;pheroidical form. As it cooled in its a&s;cent from the &s;un its nucleus
became harder; and its attendant vapours were conden&s;ed, forming the ocean.</P>
<P>3. The ma&s;&s;es or mountains of granite, porphery, ba&s;alt, and &s;tones of &s;imilar &s;tructure,
were a part of the original nucleus of the earth; or con&s;i&s;t of volcanic productions
&s;ince formed.</P>
<P>4. On this nucleus of granite and ba&s;altes, thus covered by the ocean, were formed
the calcareous beds of lime&s;tone, marble, chalk, &s;par, from the exuviae of marine animals;
with the flints, or chertz, which accompany them. And were &s;tratified by their having
been formed at different and very di&s;tant periods of time.</P>
<P>5. The whole terraqueous globe was bur&s;t by central fires; i&s;lands and continents
were rai&s;ed, con&s;i&s;ting of granite or lava in &s;ome parts, and of lime&s;tone in others; and
great vallies were &s;unk, into which the ocean retired.</P>
<P>6. During the&s;e central earthquakes the moon was ejected from the earth, cau&s;ing
new tides; and the earth's axis &s;uffered &s;ome change in its inclination, and its rotatory
motion was retarded.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="300">
7. On &s;ome parts of the&s;e i&s;lands and continents of granite or lime&s;tone were
gradually produced exten&s;ive mora&s;&s;es from the recrements of vegetables and of land
animals; and from the&s;e mora&s;&s;es, heated by fermentation, were produced clay, marle,
&s;and&s;tone, coal, iron, (with the ba&s;es of variety of acids;) all which were &s;tratified by
their having been formed at different, and very di&s;tant periods of time.</P>
<P>8. In the elevation of the mountains very numerous and deep fi&s;&s;ures nece&s;&s;arily
were produced. In the&s;e fi&s;&s;ures many of the metals are formed partly from de&s;cending
materials, and partly from a&s;cending ones rai&s;ed in vapour by &s;ubterraneous fires. In
the fi&s;&s;ures of granite or porphery quartz is formed; in the fi&s;&s;ures of lime&s;tone
calcareous &s;par is produced.</P>
<P>9. During the&s;e fir&s;t great volcanic fires it is probable the atmo&s;phere was either
produced, or much increa&s;ed; a proce&s;s which is perhaps now going on in the moon;
Mr. Her&s;chell having di&s;covered a volcanic crater three miles broad burning on her di&s;k.</P>
<P>10. The &s;ummits of the new mountains were cracked into innumerable lozenges
by the cold dews or &s;nows falling upon them when red hot. From the&s;e &s;ummits,
which were then twice as high as at pre&s;ent, cubes and lozenges of granite, and ba&s;alt,
and quartz in &s;ome countries, and of marble and flints in others, de&s;cended gradually
into the valleys, and were rolled together in the beds of rivers, (which were then &s;o large
as to occupy the whole valleys, which they now only inter&s;ect;) and produced the
great beds of gravel, of which many valleys con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>11. In &s;everal parts of the earth's &s;urface &s;ub&s;equent earthquakes, from the fermen|tation
of mora&s;&s;es, have at different periods of time deranged the po&s;ition of the matters
above de&s;cribed. Hence the gravel, which was before in the beds of rivers, has in
&s;ome places been rai&s;ed into mountains, along with clay and coal &s;trata which were
formed from mora&s;&s;es and wa&s;hed down from eminences into the beds of rivers or the
neighbouring &s;eas, and in part rai&s;ed again with gravel or marine &s;hells over them;
but this has only obtained in few places compared with the general di&s;tribution of
&s;uch materials. Hence there &s;eem to have exi&s;ted two &s;ources of earthquakes, which
have occurred at great di&s;tance of time from each other; one from the granite beds in
the central parts of the earth, and the other from the mora&s;&s;es on its &s;urface. All the
&s;ub&s;equent earthquakes and volcanos of modern days compared with the&s;e are of &s;mall
extent and in&s;ignificant effect.</P>
<P>12. Be&s;ides the argillaceous &s;and-&s;tone produced from mora&s;&s;es, which is &s;tratified
with clay, and coal, and iron, other great beds of &s;iliceous &s;and have been formed in the
&s;ea by the combination of an unknown acid from mora&s;&s;es, and the calcareous matters
of the ocean.</P>
<P>13. The warm waters which are found in many countries, are owing to &s;team
ari&s;ing from great depths through the fi&s;&s;ures of lime&s;tone or lava, elevated by &s;ub|terranean
fires, and conden&s;ed between the &s;trata of the hills over them; and not from
any decompo&s;ition of pyrites or mangane&s;e near the &s;urface of the earth.</P>
<P>14. The columns of ba&s;altes have been rai&s;ed by the congelation or expan&s;ion of
granite beds in the act of cooling from their &s;emi-vitreous fu&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XXV.&mdash;EVAPORATION.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Aquatic nymphs! you lead with viewle&s;s march</L>
<L>The winged vapour up the aerial arch. </L><BIBL><HI>CANTO III.</HI> l. 13.</BIBL></Q>
<P>1. THE atmo&s;phere will di&s;&s;olve a certain quantity of moi&s;ture as a chemical men|&s;truum,
even when it is much below the freezing point, as appears from the diminution
of ice &s;u&s;pended in fro&s;ty air, but a much greater quantity of water is evaporated and
&s;u&s;pended in the air by means of heat, which is perhaps the univer&s;al cau&s;e of fluidity,
for water is known to boil with le&s;s heat in vacuo, which is a proof that it will evaporate
fa&s;ter in vacuo, and that the air therefore rather hinders than promotes its evaporation
in higher degrees of heat. The quick evaporation occa&s;ioned in vacuo by a &s;mall degree
of heat is agreeably &s;een in what is termed a pul&s;e-gla&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ts of an exhau&s;ted
tube of gla&s;s with a bulb at each end of it and with about two thirds of the cavity filled
with alcohol, in which the &s;pirit is in&s;tantly &s;een to boil by the heat of the finger-end
applied on a bubble of &s;team in the lower bulb, and is conden&s;ed again in the upper
bulb by the lea&s;t conceivable comparative coldne&s;s.</P>
<P>2. Another circum&s;tance evincing that heat is the principal cau&s;e of evaporation is
that at the time of water being converted into &s;team, a great quantity of heat is taken
away from the neighbouring bodies. If a thermometer be repeatedly dipped in ether, or
in rectified &s;pirit of wine, and expo&s;ed to a bla&s;t of air, to expedite the evaporation by
perpetually removing the &s;aturated air from it, the thermometer will pre&s;ently &s;ink below
freezing. This warmth, taken from the ambient bodies at the time of evaporation by
the &s;team, is again given out when the &s;team is conden&s;ed into water. Hence the water
in a worm-tub during di&s;tillation &s;o &s;oon becomes hot; and hence the warmth ac|companying
the de&s;cent of rain in cold weather.</P>
<P>3. The third circum&s;tance, &s;hewing that heat is the principal cau&s;e of evaporation, is,
that &s;ome of the &s;team becomes again conden&s;ed when any part of the heat is withdrawn.
Thus when warmer &s;outh-we&s;t winds replete with moi&s;ture &s;ucceed the colder north|ea&s;t
winds all bodies that are den&s;e and &s;ub&s;tantial, as &s;tone walls, brick floors, &amp;c. ab&s;orb
&s;ome of the heat from the pa&s;&s;ing air, and its moi&s;ture becomes precipitated on them,
while the north-ea&s;t winds become warmer on their arrival in this latitude, and are
thence di&s;po&s;ed to take up more moi&s;ture, and are termed drying winds.</P>
<P>4. Heat &s;eems to be the principal cau&s;e of the &s;olution of many other bodies, as
common &s;alt, or blue vitriol di&s;&s;olved in water, which when expo&s;ed to &s;evere cold are
precipitated, or carried, to the part of the water la&s;t frozen; this I ob&s;erved in a phial
filled with a &s;olution of blue vitriol which was frozen; the phial was bur&s;t, the ice
<PB N="68" REF="302">
thawed, and a blue column of cupreous vitriol was left &s;tanding upright on the bottom
of the broken gla&s;s, as de&s;cribed in note XIX.</P>
<P>II. Hence water may either be di&s;&s;olved in air, and may then be called an aerial
&s;olution of water; or it may be di&s;&s;olved in the fluid matter of heat, according to the
theory of M. Lavoi&s;ier, and may then be called &s;team. In the former ca&s;e it is probable
there are many other vapours which may precipitate it, as marine acid gas, or fluor acid
gas. So alcaline gas and acid gas di&s;&s;olved in air precipitate each other, nitrous gas pre|cipitates
vital air from its azote, and inflammable gas mixed with vital air ignited by an
electric &s;park either produces or precipitates the water in both of them. Are there any
&s;ubtle exhalations occa&s;ionally diffu&s;ed in the atmo&s;phere which may thus cau&s;e rain?</P>
<P>1. But as water is perhaps many hundred times more &s;oluble in the fluid matter of
heat than in air, I &s;uppo&s;e the education of this heat, by whatever means it is occa&s;ioned,
is the principal cau&s;e of devaporation. Thus if a region of air is brought from a
warmer climate, as the S. W. winds, it becomes cooled by its contact with the earth in
this latitude, and parts with &s;o much of its moi&s;ture as was di&s;&s;olved in the quantity of
calorique, or heat, which it now loo&s;es, but retains that part which was &s;u&s;pended by its
attraction to the particles of air, or by aerial &s;olution, even in the mo&s;t &s;evere fro&s;ts.</P>
<P>2. A &s;econd immediate cau&s;e of rain is a &s;tream of N. E. wind de&s;cending from a
&s;uperior current of air, and mixing with the warmer S. W. wind below; or the rever&s;e
of this, viz. a &s;uperior current of S. W. wind mixing with an inferior one of N. E.
wind; in both the&s;e ca&s;es the whole heaven becomes in&s;tantly clouded, and the moi&s;ture
contained in the S. W. current is precipitated. This cau&s;e of devaporation has been
ingeniou&s;ly explained by Dr. Hutton in the Tran&s;act. of Edinburgh, Vol. I. and &s;eems
to ari&s;e from this circum&s;tance; the particles of air of the N. E. wind educe part of
the heat from the S. W. wind, and therefore the water which was di&s;&s;olved by that
quantity of <HI>heat</HI> is precipitated; all the other part of the water, which was &s;u&s;pended
by its attraction to the particles of air, or di&s;&s;olved in the remainder of the heat, continues unprecipitated.</P>
<P>3. A third method by which a region of air becomes cooled, and in con&s;equence
depo&s;its much of its moi&s;ture, is from the mechanical expan&s;ion of air, when part of the
pre&s;&s;ure is taken off. In this ca&s;e the expanded air becomes capable of receiving or
attracting more of the matter of heat into its inter&s;tices, and the vapour, which was
previou&s;ly di&s;&s;olved in this heat, is depo&s;ited, as is &s;een in the receiver of an air-pump,
which becomes dewy, as the air within becomes expanded by the education of part of it.
See note VII. Hence when the mercury in the barometer &s;inks without a change of
the wind the air generally becomes colder. See note VII. on Elementary Heat. And it
is probably from the varying pre&s;&s;ure of the incumbent air that in &s;ummer days &s;mall
black clouds are often thus &s;uddenly produced, and again &s;oon vani&s;h. See a paper in
Philos. Tran&s;. Vol. LXXVIII. intitled Frigorific Experiments on the Mechanical Ex|pan&s;ion
of Air.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="303">
4. Another portion of atmo&s;pheric water may po&s;&s;ibly be held in &s;olution by the
electric fluid, &s;ince in thunder &s;torms a precipitation of the water &s;eems to be either the
cau&s;e or the con&s;equence of the eduction of the electricity. But it appears more pro|bable
that the water is conden&s;ed into clouds by the eduction of its heat, and that then
the &s;urplus of electricity prevents their coale&s;cence into larger drops, which immediately
&s;ucceeds the departure of the lightning.</P>
<P>5. The immediate cau&s;e why the barometer &s;inks before rain is, fir&s;t, becau&s;e a region
of warm air, brought to us in the place of the cold air which it had di&s;placed, mu&s;t
weigh lighter, both &s;pecifically and ab&s;olutely, if the height of the warm atmo&s;phere be
&s;uppo&s;ed to be equal to that or the preceeding cold one. And &s;econdly, after the drops
of rain begin to fall in any column of air, that column becomes lighter, the falling drops
only adding to the pr&s;&s;ure of the air in proportion to the re&s;i&s;tance which they meet
with in pa&s;&s;ing through that fluid.</P>
<P>If we could &s;uppo&s;e water to be di&s;&s;olved in air without heat, or in very low degrees
of heat, I &s;uppo&s;e the air would become heavier, as happens in many chemical &s;olution,
but if water di&s;&s;olved in the matter of heat, or calorique, be mixed with an aerial &s;olutions,
of water, there can be no doubt but an atmo&s;phere con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch a mixture mu&s;t
become lighter in proportion to the quantity of calorique. On the &s;ame circum&s;tance
depends the vi&s;ible vapour produced from the breath of animals in cold weather, or
from a boiling kettle; the particles of cold air, with which it is mixed, &s;teal a part
of its heat, and become them&s;elves rai&s;ed in temperature, whence part of the water
is precipitated in vi&s;ible vapour, which, if in great quantity &s;inks to the ground; if in
&s;mall quantity, and the &s;urrounding air is not previou&s;ly &s;aturated, it &s;preads it&s;elf till it
becomes again di&s;&s;olved.</P>

<P>THE &s;urface of the earth con&s;i&s;ts of &s;trata many of which were formed originally
beneath the &s;ea, the mountains were afterwards forced up by &s;ubterraneous fires, as
appears from the fillures in the rocks of which they con&s;i&s;t the quantity of volcanic
productions all over the world, and the numerous remains of craters of volcanos in
mountainous countries. Hence the &s;trata which compo&s;e the &s;ides of mountains lie
&s;lanting downwards, and one or two or more of the external &s;trata not reaching to the
&s;ummit when the mountain was rai&s;ed up, the &s;econd or third &s;tratum or a more inferior
one is there expo&s;ed to day; this may be well repre&s;ented by forceably thru&s;ting a
blunt in&s;trument through &s;everal &s;heets of paper, a bur will &s;tand up with the lowermo&s;t
&s;heet &s;tanding highe&s;t in the center of it. On this uppermo&s;t &s;tratum, which is colder as
it is more elevated, the dews are conden&s;ed in large quantities; and &s;liding down pa&s;s
under the fir&s;t or &s;econd or third &s;tratum which compo&s;e the &s;ides of the hill; and either
form a mora&s;s below, or a weeping rock, by oozing out in numerous places, or many
of the&s;e le&s;s currents meeting together bur&s;t out in a more copious rill.</P>
<P>The &s;ummits of mountains are much colder than the plains in their vicinity, owing
to &s;everal cau&s;es; 1. Their being in a manner in&s;ulated or cut off from the common
heat of the earth, which is always of 48 degrees, and perpetually counteracts the effects
of external cold beneath that degree. 2. From their &s;urfaces being larger in proportion
to their &s;olid contents, and hence their heat more expeditiou&s;ly carried away by the
ever-moving atmo&s;phere. 3. The increa&s;ing rarity of the air as the mountain ri&s;es.
All tho&s;e bodies which conduct electricity well or ill, conduct the matter of heat likewi&s;e
well or ill. See note VII. Atmo&s;pheric air is a bad conductor of electricity and thence
confines it on the body where it is accumulated, but when it is made very rare, as in the
exhau&s;ted receiver, the electric aura pa&s;&s;es away immediately to any di&s;tance. The
&s;ame circum&s;tance probably happens in re&s;pect to heat, which is thus kept by the den&s;er
air on the plains from e&s;caping, but is di&s;&s;ipated on the hills where the air is thinner.
4. As the currents of air ri&s;e up the &s;ides of mountains they become mechanically
rarefied, the pre&s;&s;ure of the incumbent column le&s;&s;ening as they a&s;cend. Hence the
expanding air ab&s;orbs heat from the mountain as it a&s;cends, as explained in note VII.
5. There is another, and perhaps more powerful cau&s;e, I &s;u&s;pect, which may occa&s;ion
the great cold on mountains, and in the higher parts of the atmo&s;phere, and which has
not yet been attended to; I mean that the fluid matter of heat may prodably gravitate
round the earth, and form an atmo&s;phere on its &s;urface, mixed with the aerial atmo&s;phere,
which may dimini&s;h or become rarer, as it recedes from the earth's &s;urface, in a greater
proportion than the air dimini&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="305">
6. The great conden&s;ation of moi&s;ture on the &s;ummits of hills has another cau&s;e,
which is the da&s;hing of moving clouds again&s;t them, in mi&s;ty days this is often &s;een
to have great effect on plains, where an eminent tree by ob&s;tructing the mi&s;t as it
moves along &s;hall have a much greater quantity of moi&s;ture drop from its leaves than
falls at the &s;ame time on the ground in its vicinity. Mr. White, in his Hi&s;tory of
Selborne gives an account of a large tree &s;o &s;ituated, from which a &s;tream flowed during
a moving mi&s;t &s;o as to fill the cart-ruts in a lane otherwi&s;e not very moi&s;t, and ingeniou&s;ly
adds, that trees planted about ponds of &s;tagnant water contribute much by the&s;e means
to &s;upply the re&s;ervoir. The &s;pherules which con&s;titute a mi&s;t or cloud are kept from
uniting by &s;o &s;mall a power that a little agitation again&s;t the leaves of a tree, or the
greater attraction of a flat moi&s;t &s;urface, conden&s;es or precipitates them.</P>
<P>If a leaf has its &s;urface moi&s;tened and particles of water &s;eparate from each other
as in a mi&s;t be brought near the moi&s;tened &s;urface of a leaf, each particle will be attracted
more by that plain &s;urface of water on the leaf than it can be by the &s;urrounding
particles of the mi&s;t, becau&s;e globules only attract each other in one point, whereas a
plain attracts a globule by a greater extent of its &s;urface.</P>
<P>The common cold &s;prings are thus formed on elevated grounds by the conden&s;ed
vapours, and hence are &s;tronger when the nights are cold after hot days in &s;pring, than
even in the wet days of winter. For the warm atmo&s;phere during the day has di&s;&s;olved
much more water than it can &s;upport in &s;olution during the cold of the night, which is
thus depo&s;ited in large quantities on the hills, and yet &s;o gradually as to &s;oak in between
the &s;trata of them, rather than to &s;lide off over their &s;urfaces like &s;howers of rain.
The common heat of the internal parts of the earth is a&s;certained by &s;prings which
ari&s;e from &s;trata of earth too deep to be affected by the heat of &s;ummer or the fro&s;ts of
winter. Tho&s;e in this country are of 48 degrees of heat, tho&s;e about Philidelphia were &s;aid
by Dr. Franklin to be 52; whether this variation is to be accounted for by the difference
of the &s;un's heat on that country, according to the ingenious theory of Mr. Kirwan, or to
the vicinity of &s;ubterranean fires is not yet, I think, decided. There are however &s;ub|terraneous
&s;treams of water not exactly produced in this manner, as &s;treams i&s;&s;uing from
fi&s;&s;ures in the earth, communicating with the craters of old volcanoes; in the Peak of
Derby&s;hire are many hollows, called &s;wallows, where the land floods &s;ink into the
earth, and come out at &s;ome miles di&s;tant, as at Ilam near A&s;hborne. See note on
Fica, Vol. II.</P>
<P>Other &s;treams of cold water ari&s;e from beneath the &s;now on the Alps and Andes,
and other high mountains, which is perpetualy thawing at its under &s;urface by the
common heat of the earth, and gives ri&s;e to large rivers. For the origin of warm &s;prings

<P>It is &s;aid that this animal fore&s;ees tempe&s;tuous weather, and &s;inking to the bottom of

<P>There is a kind of Nautilus, called by Linneus, Argonauta, who&s;e &s;hell has but one
cell; of this animal Pliny affirms, that having exonerated its &s;hell by throwing out the
water, it &s;wims upon the &s;urface, extending a web of wonderful tenuity, and bending back
two of its arms and rowing with the re&s;t, makes a &s;ail, and at length receiving the water
dives again. Plin. IX. 29. Linneus adds to his de&s;cription of this animal, that like the
the Crab Diogenes or Bernhard, it occupies a hou&s;e not its own, as it is not connected
to its &s;hell, and is therefore foreign to it; who could have given credit to this if it had
not been atte&s;ted by &s;o many who have with their own eyes &s;een this argonaut in the
act of &s;ailing? Sy&s;t. Nat. p. 1161.</P>
<P>The Nautilus, properly &s;o named by Linneus, has a &s;hell con&s;i&s;ting of many cham|bers,
of which cups are made in the Ea&s;t with beautiful painting and carving on the
mother-pearl. The animal is &s;aid to inhabit only the uppermo&s;t or open chamber, which
is larger than the re&s;t; and that the re&s;t remain empty except that the pipe, or &s;iphun|culus,
which communicates from one to the other of them is filled with an appendage of
the animal like a gut or &s;tring. Mr. Hook in his Philos. Exper. p. 306, imagines this to
be a dilatable or compre&s;&s;ible tube, like the air-bladders of fi&s;h, and that by contracting
or permitting it to expand, it renders its &s;hell boyant or the contrary. See Note on Ulva,
Vol. II.</P>
<P>The Pinna, or Sea-wing, is contained in a two-valve &s;hell, weighing &s;ometimes fifteen
pounds, and emits a beard of fine long glo&s;&s;y &s;ilk-like fibres, by which it is &s;u&s;pended to
the rocks twenty or thirty feet beneath the &s;urface of the &s;ea. In this &s;ituation it is &s;o
&s;ucce&s;sfully attacked by the eight-footed Polypus, that the &s;pecies perhaps could not exi&s;t
<PB N="73" REF="307">
but for the exertions of the Cancer Pinnotheris, who lives in the &s;ame &s;hell as a guard
and companion. Amoen. Academ. Vol. II. p. 48. Lin. Sy&s;t. Nat. Vol. I. p. 1159, and
p. 1040.</P>
<P>The Pinnotheris, or Pinnophylax, is a &s;mall crab naked like Bernard the Hermit, but
is furni&s;hed with good eyes, and lives in the &s;ame &s;hell with the Pinna; when they want
food the Pinna opens its &s;hell, and &s;ends its faithful ally to forage; but if the Cancer
&s;ees the Polypus, he returns &s;uddenly to the arms of his blind ho&s;te&s;&s;s, who by clo&s;ing the
&s;hell avoids the fury of her enemy; otherwi&s;e, when it has procured a booty, it brings it
to the opening of the &s;hell, where it is admitted, and they divide the prey. This was
ob&s;erved by Ha&s;lequi&s;t in his voyage to Pale&s;tine.</P>
<P>The By&s;&s;us of the antients, according to Ari&s;totle, was the beard of the Pinna above
mentioned, but &s;eems to have been u&s;ed by other writers indi&s;criminately for any &s;pun
material, which was e&s;teemed finer or more valuable than wool. Reaumur &s;ays the
threads of this By&s;&s;us are not le&s;s fine or le&s;s beautiful than the &s;ilk, as it is &s;pun by the
&s;ilk-worm; the Pinna on the coa&s;ts of Italy and Provence (where it is fi&s;hed up by iron|hooks
fixed on long poles) is called the &s;ilk-worm of the &s;ea. The &s;tockings and gloves
manufactured from it, are of exqui&s;ite finene&s;s, but too warm for common wear, and are
thence e&s;teemed u&s;eful in rhumati&s;m and gout. Dict. Rai&s;onn&eacute; art. Pinne-marine. The
warmth of the By&s;&s;us, like that of &s;ilk, is probably owing to their being bad conductors
of heat, as well as of electricity. When the&s;e fibres are broken by violence, this animal
as well as the mu&s;cle has the power to reproduce them like the common &s;piders, as was
ob&s;erved by M. Adan&s;on. As raw &s;ilk, and raw cobwebs, when &s;wallowed, are liable to
produce great &s;ickne&s;s (as I am informed) it is probable the part of mu&s;cles, which
&s;ometimes di&s;agrees with the people who eat them, may be this &s;ilky web, by which
they attach them&s;elves to &s;tones. The large kind of Pinna contains &s;ome mother-pearl
of a reddi&s;h tinge, according to M. d'Argenville. The &s;ub&s;tance &s;old under the name
of Indian weed, and u&s;ed at the bottom of fi&s;h-lines, is probably a production of this
kind, which however is &s;carcely to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the eye from the tendons of a
rat's tail, after they have been &s;eparated by putrefaction in water, and well cleaned and
rubbed; a production, which I was once &s;hewn as a great curio&s;ity; it had the upper|mo&s;t
bone of the tail adhering to it, and was &s;aid to have been u&s;ed as an ornament
in a lady's hair.</P>

<L>Of Oil effu&s;ive lull the waves to &s;leep. </L><BIBL><HI>CANTO III.</HI> l. 87.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THERE is rea&s;on to believe that when oil is poured upon water, the two &s;urfaces
do not touch each other, but that the oil is &s;u&s;pended over the water by their mutual
repul&s;ion. This &s;eems to be rendered probable by the following experiment: if one
drop of oil be droped on a ba&s;on of water, it will immediately diffu&s;e it&s;elf over the whole,
for there being no friction between the two &s;urfaces, there is nothing to prevent its
&s;preading it&s;elf by the gravity of the upper part of it, except its own tenacity, into a pellicle
<PB N="75" REF="309">
of the greate&s;t tenuity. But if a &s;econd drop of oil be put upon the former, it does not
&s;pread it&s;elf, but remains in the form of a drop, as the other already occupied the whole
&s;urface of the ba&s;on, and there is friction in oil pa&s;&s;ing over oil, though none in oil
pa&s;&s;ing over water.</P>
<P>Hence when oil is diffu&s;ed on the &s;urface of water gentle breezes have no influence in
rai&s;ing waves upon it; for a &s;mall quantity of oil will cover a very great &s;urface of water,
(I &s;uppo&s;e a &s;poonful will diffu&s;e it&s;elf over &s;ome acres) and the wind blowing upon this
carries it gradually forwards; and there being no friction between the two &s;urfaces the
water is not affected. On which account oil has no effect in &s;tilling the agitation of the
water after the wind cea&s;es, as was found by the experiments of Dr. Franklin.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance lately brought into notice by Dr. Franklin had been mentioned by
Pliny, and is &s;aid to be in u&s;e by the divers for pearls, who in windy weather taken down
with them a little oil in their mouths, which they occa&s;ionally give out when the in|equality
of the &s;upernatant waves prevents them from &s;eeing &s;ufficiently di&s;tinctly for their
purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The wonderful tenuity with which oil can be &s;pread upon water is evinced by a
few drops projected from a bridge, where the eye is properly placed over it, pa&s;&s;ing
through all the pri&s;matic colours as it diffu&s;es it&s;elf. And al&s;o from another curious ex|periment
of Dr. Franklin's: he cut a piece of cork to about the &s;ize of a letter-wafer,
leaving a point &s;tanding off like a tangent at one edge of the circle. This piece of cork
was then dipped in oil and thrown into a large pond of water, and as the oil flowed off at
the point, the cork-wafer continued to revolve in a contrary direction for &s;everal minutes.
The oil flowing off all that time at the pointed tangent in coloured &s;treams. In a &s;mall
pond of water this experiment does not &s;o well &s;ucceed, as the circulation of the cork
&s;tops as &s;oon as the water becomes covered with the pellicle of oil. See Additional
Note, No. XIII. and Note on Fucus, Vol. II.</P>
<P>The ea&s;e with which oil and water &s;lide over each other is agreeably &s;een if a phial be
about half filled with equal parts of oil and water, and made to o&s;cillate &s;u&s;pended by a
&s;tring, the upper &s;urface of the oil and the lower one of the water will always keep
&s;mooth; but the agitation of the &s;urfaces where the oil and water meet, is curious; for
their &s;pecific gravities being not very different, and their friction on each other nothing,
the highe&s;t &s;ide of the water, as the phial de&s;cends in its o&s;cillation, having acquired a
greater momentum than the lowe&s;t &s;ide (from its having de&s;cended further) would ri&s;e
the highe&s;t on the a&s;cending &s;ide of the o&s;cillation, and thence pu&s;hes the then uppermo&s;t
part of the water among&s;t the oil.</P>

<P>ON the coa&s;t of Norway there is an exten&s;ive vortex, or eddy, which lies between the
i&s;lands of Mo&s;koe and Mo&s;kenas, and is called Mo&s;koe&s;trom, or Mael&s;trom; it occupies
&s;ome leagues in circumference, and is &s;aid to be very dangerous and often de&s;tructive
to ve&s;&s;els navigating the&s;e &s;eas. It is not ea&s;y to under&s;tand the exi&s;tence of a
con&s;tant de&s;cending &s;tream without &s;uppo&s;ing it mu&s;t pa&s;s through a &s;ubterranean
cavity to &s;ome other part of the earth or ocean which may lie beneath its level; as the
Mediterranean &s;eems to lie beneath the level of the Atlantic ocean, which therefore
<PB N="77" REF="311">
con&s;tantly flows into it through the Straits; and the waters of the Gulph of Mexico
lie much above the level of the &s;ea about the Floridas and further northward, which
gives ri&s;e to the Gulph-&s;tream, as de&s;cribed in note on Ca&s;&s;ia in Vol. II.</P>
<P>The Mael&s;trom is &s;aid to be &s;till twice in about twenty-four hours when the tide is
up, and mo&s;t violent at the oppo&s;ite times of the day. This is not difficult to account
for, &s;ince when &s;o much water is brought over the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, if &s;uch exi&s;ts,
as compleatly to fill it and &s;tand many feet above it, le&s;s di&s;turbance mu&s;t appear on the
&s;urface. The Mael&s;trom is de&s;cribed in the Memoires of the Swedi&s;h Academy of
Sciences, and Pontoppiden's Hi&s;t. of Norway, and in Univer&s;al Mu&s;eum for 1763,
p. 131.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why eddies of water become hollow in the middle is becau&s;e the water
immediately over the centre of the well, or cavity, falls fa&s;ter, having le&s;s friction to
oppo&s;e its de&s;cent, than the water over the circumference or edges of the well. The
circular motion or gyration of eddies depends on the obliquity of the cour&s;e of the
&s;tream, or to the friction or oppo&s;ition to it being greater on one &s;ide of the well than
the other; I have ob&s;erved in water pa&s;&s;ing through a hole in the bottom of a trough,
which was always kept full, the gyration of the &s;tream might be turned either way by
increa&s;ing the oppo&s;ition of one &s;ide of the eddy with ones finger, or by turning the
&s;pout, through which the water was introduced, a little more obliquely to the hole on
one &s;ide or on the other. Lighter bodies are liable to be retained long in eddies of
water, while tho&s;e rather heavier than water are &s;oon thrown out beyond the circum|ference
by their acquired momentum becoming greater than that of the water. Thus if
equal portions of oil and water be put into a phial, and by means of a &s;tring be whirled
in a circle round the hand, the water will always keep at the greater di&s;tance from the
centre, whence in the eddies formed in rivers during a flood a per&s;on who endeavours
to keep above water or to &s;wim is liable to be detained in them, but on &s;uffering him&s;elf
to &s;ink or dive he is &s;aid readily to e&s;cape. This circulation of water in de&s;cending
through a hole in a ve&s;&s;el Dr. Franklin has ingeniou&s;ly applied to the explanation of
hurricanes or eddies of air.</P>

<P>THE common heat of the interior parts of the earth being always 48 degrees, both in
winter and &s;ummer, the &s;now which lies in contact with it is always in a thawing &s;tate;
Hence in ice-hou&s;es the external parts of the collection of ice is perpetually thawing and
thus pre&s;erves the internal part of it; &s;o that it is nece&s;&s;ary to lay up many tons for the
pre&s;ervation of one ton. Hence in Italy con&s;iderable rivers have their &s;ource from
beneath the eternal glaciers, or mountains of &s;now and ice.</P>
<P>In our country when the air in the cour&s;e of a fro&s;t continues a day or two at very
near 32 degrees, the common heat of the earth thaws the ice on its &s;urface, while the
thermometer remains at the freezing point. This circum&s;tance is often ob&s;ervable in
the rimy mornings of &s;pring; the thermometer &s;hall continue at the freezing point,
yet all the rime will vani&s;h, except that which happens to lie on a bridge, a board, or on
a cake of cow-dung, which being thus as it were in&s;ulated or cut off from &s;o free a com|munication
with the common heat of the earth by means of the air under the bridge, or
wood, or dung, which are bad conductors of heat, continues &s;ome time longer unthawed.
Hence when the ground is covered thick with &s;now, though the fro&s;t continues, and the
&s;un does not &s;hine, yet the &s;now is ob&s;erved to decrea&s;e very &s;en&s;ibly. For the common
heat of the earth melts the under &s;urface of it, and the upper one evaporates by its
&s;olution in the air. The great evaporation of ice was ob&s;erved by Mr. Boyle, which
experiment I repeated &s;ome time ago. Having &s;u&s;pended a piece of ice by a wire and
weighed it with care without touching it with my hand, I hung it out the whole of a
clear fro&s;ty night, and &s;ound in the morning it had lo&s;t nearly a fifth of its weight.
Mr. N. Wallerius has &s;ince ob&s;erved that ice at the time of its congelation evaporates
fa&s;ter than water in its fluid form; which may be accounted for from the heat given out
at the in&s;tant of freezing; (Sau&s;&s;ure's E&s;&s;ais &s;ur Hygromet. p. 249.) but this effect is
only momentary.</P>
<P>Thus the vegetables that are covered with &s;now are &s;eldom injured; &s;ince, as they
lie between the thawing &s;now, which has 32 degrees of heat, and the covered earth
which has 48, they are pre&s;erved in a degree of heat between the&s;e; viz. in 40 degrees of
heat. Whence the mo&s;s on which the rein-deer feed in the northern latitudes vegetates

<L>And Eurus &s;teas his ice-winds from the pole. </L><BIBL><HI>CANTO IV.</HI> l. 15</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE theory of the winds is yet very imperfect, in part perhaps owing to the want
of ob&s;ervations &s;ufficiently numerous of the exact times and places where they begin and
cea&s;e to blow, but chiefly to our yet imperfect knowledge of the means by which great
regions of air are either &s;uddenly produced or &s;uddenly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The air is perpetually &s;ubject to increa&s;e or diminution from its combination with
other bodies, or its evolution from them. The vital part of the air, called oxygene, is
continually produced in this climate from the per&s;piration of vegetables in the &s;un&s;hine,
and probably from the action of light on clouds or on water in the tropical climates,
where the &s;un has greater power, and may exert &s;ome yet umknown laws of luminous
combination. Another part of the atmo&s;phere, which is called azote, is perpetually &s;et
at liberty from animal and vegetable bodies by putrefaction or combu&s;tion, from many
&s;prings of water, from volatile alcali, and probably from fixed alcali, of which there is an
exhau&s;tle&s;s &s;ource in the water of the ocean. Both the&s;e component parts of the air are
perpetually again dimini&s;hed by their contact with the &s;oil, which covers the &s;urface
of the earth, producing nitre. The oxygene is dimini&s;hed in the production of all acids,
of which the carbonic and muriatic exi&s;t in great abundance. The azote is dimini&s;hed
in the growth of animal bodies, of which it con&s;titutes an important part, and in its
combinations with many other natural productions.</P>
<P>They are both probably dimini&s;hed in immen&s;e quantities by uniting with the
inflammable air, which ari&s;es from the mud of rivers and lakes at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, when
the atmo&s;phere is light: the oxgene of the air producing water, and the azote producing
volatile alcali by their combinations with this inflammable air. At other &s;ea&s;ons of the
year the&s;e principles may again change their combinations, and the atmo&s;pheric air be
reproduced.</P>
<P>Mr. Lavoi&s;ier found that one pound of charcoal in burning con&s;umed two pounds
nine ounces of vital air, or oxygene. The con&s;umption of vital air in the proce&s;s of
making red lead may readily be reduced to calculation; a &s;mall barrel contains about
twelve hundred weight of this commodity, 1200 pounds of lead by calcination ab&s;orb
about 144 pounds of vital air; now as a cubic foot of water weighs 1000 averdupois
ounces, and as vital air is above 800 times lighter than water, it follows that every barrel
of red lead contains nearly 2000 cubic feet of vital air. If this can be performed in
miniature in a &s;mall oven, what may not be done in the immen&s;e elaboratories of
nature!</P>
<P>The&s;e great elaboratories of nature include almo&s;t all her fo&s;&s;il as well as her animal

<P>In this account the fixed air was previou&s;ly extracted from the lime&s;tones by acids,
and the heat applied was much le&s;s than was nece&s;&s;ary to extract all the air from the
bodies employed. Add to this the known quantities of air which are combined with the
calciform ores, as the ochres of iron, mangane&s;e, calamy, grey ore of lead, and &s;ome idea
may be formed of the great production of air in volcanic eruptions, as mentioned in
note on Chunda, Vol. II. and of the perpetual ab&s;orptions and evolutions of whole
oceans of air from every part of the earth.</P>
<P>But there would &s;eem to be an officina aeris, a &s;hop where air is both manufactured
and de&s;troyed in the greate&s;t abundance within the polar circles, as will hereafter be &s;poken
of. Can this be effected by &s;ome yet unknown law of the congelation of aqueous or
&s;aline fluids, which may &s;et at liberty their combined heat, and convert a part both of
the acid and alcali of &s;ea-water into their component airs? Or on the contrary can the
electricity of the northern lights convert inflammable air and oxygene into water, whil&s;t
the great degree of cold at the poles unites the azote with &s;ome other ba&s;e? Another
officina aeris, or manufacture of air, would &s;eem to exi&s;t within the tropics or at the
line, though in a much le&s;s quantity than at the poles, owing perhaps to the action of
the &s;un's light on the moi&s;ture &s;u&s;pended in the air, as will al&s;o be &s;poken of hereafter;
but in all other parts of the earth the&s;e ab&s;orptions and evolutions of air in a greater or
le&s;s degree are perpetually going on in inconceivable abundance; increa&s;ed probably, and
dimini&s;hed at different &s;ea&s;ons of the year by the approach or retroce&s;&s;ion of the &s;un's
light; future di&s;coveries mu&s;t elucidate this part of the &s;ubject. To this &s;hould be added
<PB N="81" REF="315">
that as heat and electricity, and perhaps magneti&s;m, are known to di&s;place air, that it is
not impo&s;&s;ible but that the increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed quantities of the&s;e fluids diffu&s;ed in
the atmo&s;phere may increa&s;e its weight a well as its bulk; &s;ince their &s;pecific attractions
or affinities to matter are very &s;trong, they probably al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s general gravitation to the
earth; a &s;ubject which wants further inve&s;tigation. See Note XXVI.</P>

<P>The velocity of the &s;urface of the earth in moving round its axis dimini&s;hes from the
equator to the poles. Whence if a region of air in this country &s;hould be &s;uddenly
removed a few degrees towards the north it mu&s;t con&s;titute a we&s;tern wind, becau&s;e
from the velocity it had previou&s;ly acquired in this climate by its friction with the earth
it would for a time move quicker than the &s;urface of the country it was removed to;
the contrary mu&s;t en&s;ue when a region of air is tran&s;ported from this country a few
degrees &s;outhward, becau&s;e the velocity it had acquired in this climate would be le&s;s
than that of the earth's &s;urface where it was removed to, whence it would appear to
con&s;titute a wind from the ea&s;t, while in reality the eminent parts of the earth would
be carried again&s;t the too &s;low air. But if this tran&s;portation of air from &s;outh to north
be performed gradually, the motion of the wind will blow in the diagonal between
&s;outh and we&s;t. And on the contrary if a region of air be gradually removed from
north to &s;outh it would al&s;o blow diagonally between the north and ea&s;t, from whence we
may &s;afely conclude that all our winds in this country which blow from the north or ea&s;t,
or any point between them, con&s;i&s;t of regions of air brought from the north; and that
all our winds blowing from the &s;outh or we&s;t, or from any point between them, are
regions of air brought from the &s;outh.</P>
<P>It frequently happens during the vernal months that after a north-ea&s;t wind has
pa&s;&s;ed over us for &s;everal weeks, during which time the barometer has &s;tood at above
30 &frac12; inches, it becomes &s;uddenly &s;ucceeded by a &s;outh-we&s;t wind, which al&s;o continues
&s;everal weeks, and the barometer &s;inks to nearly 28 &frac12; inches. Now as two inches of
the mercury in the barometer balance one-fifteenth part of the whole atmo&s;phere, an
important que&s;tion here pre&s;ents it&s;elf, <HI>what is become of all this air.</HI></P>
<P>1. This great quantity of air can not be carried in a &s;uperior current towards the
line, while the inferior current flows towards the poles, becau&s;e then it would equally
affect the barometer, which &s;hould not therefore &s;ub&s;ide from 30 &frac12; inches to 28 &frac12; for
&s;ix weeks together.</P>
<P>2. It cannot be owing to the air having lo&s;t all the moi&s;ture which was previou&s;ly
di&s;&s;olved in it, becau&s;e the&s;e warm &s;outh-we&s;t winds are replete with moi&s;ture, and the
cold north-ea&s;t winds, which weigh up the mercury in the barometer to 31 inches,
con&s;i&s;t of dry air.</P>
<P>3. It can not be carried over the polar regions and be accumulated on the meridian
oppo&s;ite to us in its pa&s;&s;age towards the line, as &s;uch an accumulation would equal
one-fifteenth of the whole atmo&s;phere, and can not be &s;uppo&s;ed to remain in that
&s;ituation for &s;ix weeks together,</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="316">
4. It can not depend on the exi&s;tence of tides in the atmo&s;phere, &s;ince it mu&s;t then
corre&s;pond to lunar periods. Nor to accumulations of air from the &s;pecific levity of
the upper regions of the atmo&s;phere, &s;ince its degree of fluidity mu&s;t corre&s;pond with its
tenuity, and con&s;equently &s;uch great mountains of air can not be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t for
&s;o many weeks together as the &s;outh-we&s;t winds &s;ometimes continue.</P>
<P>5. It remains therefore that there mu&s;t be at this time a great and &s;udden ab&s;orption
of air in the polar circle by &s;ome unknown operation of nature, and that the &s;outh
wind runs in to &s;upply the deficiency. Now as this &s;outh wind con&s;i&s;ts of air brought
from a part of the earth's &s;urface which moves fa&s;ter than it does in this climate it
mu&s;t have at the &s;ame time a direction from the we&s;t by retaining part of the velocity
it had previou&s;ly acquired. The&s;e &s;outh-we&s;t winds coming from a warmer country,
and becoming colder by their contact with the earth of this climate, and by their
evpan&s;ion, (&s;o great a part of the &s;uperincumbent atmo&s;phere having vani&s;hed,) pre|cipitate
their moi&s;ture; and as they continue for &s;everal weeks to be ab&s;orbed in the
polar circle would &s;eem to receive a perpetual &s;upply from the tropical regions, e&s;pecially
over the line, as will hereafter be &s;poken of.</P>
<P>It may &s;ometimes happen that a north-ea&s;t wind having pa&s;&s;ed over us may be
bent down and driven back before it has acquired any heat from the climate, and may
thus for a few hours or a day have a &s;outh-we&s;t direction, and from its de&s;cending
from a higher region of the atmo&s;phere may po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater degree of cold than an
inferior north-ea&s;t current of air.</P>
<P>The extreme cold of Jan. 13, 1709, at Paris came on with a gentle &s;outh wind,
and was dimini&s;hed when the wind changed to the north, which is accounted for by
Mr. Homberg from a reflux of air which had been flowing for &s;ome time from the
north. Chemical E&s;&s;ays by R. Wat&s;on, Vol. V. p. 182.</P>
<P>It may happen that a north-ea&s;t current may for a day or two pa&s;s over us and
produce ince&s;&s;ant rain by mixing with the inferior &s;outh-we&s;t current; but this as
well as the former is of &s;hort duration, as its friction will &s;oon carry the inferior current
along with it, and dry or fro&s;ty weather will then &s;ucceed.</P>

<P>The north-ea&s;t winds of this country con&s;i&s;t of regions of air from the north,
travelling &s;ometimes at the rate of about a mile in two minutes during the vernal
months for &s;everal weeks together from the polar regions toward the &s;outh, the
mercury in the barometer &s;tanding above 30. The&s;e winds con&s;i&s;t of air greatly
cooled by the evaporation of the ice and &s;now over which it pa&s;&s;es, and as they become
warmer by their contact with the earth of this climate are capable of di&s;&s;olving more
moi&s;ture as they pa&s;s along, and are thence attended with fro&s;ts in winter and with dry
hot weather in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>1. This great quantity of air can not be &s;upplied by &s;uperior currents pa&s;&s;ing in a
contrary direction from &s;outh to north, becau&s;e &s;uch currents mu&s;t as they ari&s;e into

in &s;ome part of their pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>2. The whole atmo&s;phere mu&s;t have increa&s;ed in quantity, becau&s;e it appears by
the barometer that there exi&s;ts one-fifteenth part more air over us for many weeks
together, which could not be thus accumulated by difference of temperature in re&s;pect
to heat, or by any aero&s;tatic laws at pre&s;ent known, or by any lunar influence.</P>
<P>From whence it would appear that immen&s;e ma&s;&s;es of air were &s;et at liberty from
their combinations with &s;olid bodies, along with a &s;ufficient quantity of combined heat,
within the polar circle, or in &s;ome region to the north of us; and that they thus per|petually
increa&s;e the quantity of the atmo&s;phere; and that this is again at certain times
re-ab&s;orbed, or enters into new combinations at the line or tropical regions. By which
wonderful contrivance the atmo&s;phere is perpetually renewed and rendered fit for the

<P>The &s;outh-ea&s;t winds of this country con&s;i&s;t of air from the north which had pa&s;&s;ed
by us, or over us, and before it had obtained the velocity of the earth's &s;urface in this
climate had been driven back, owing to a deficiency of air now commencing at the
polar regions. Hence the&s;e are generally dry or freezing winds, and if they &s;ucceed
north-ea&s;t winds &s;hould progno&s;ticate a change of wind from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t;
the barometer is generally about 30. They are &s;ometimes attended with cloudy
weather, or rain, owing to their having acquired an increa&s;ed degree of warmth and
moi&s;ture before they became retrograde; or to their being mixed with air from the
&s;outh.</P>
<P>2. Sometimes the&s;e &s;outh-ea&s;t winds con&s;i&s;t of a vertical eddy of north-ea&s;t air,
without any mixture of &s;outh-we&s;t air; in that ca&s;e the barometer continues above 30,
and the weather is dry or fro&s;ty for four or five days together.</P>
<P>It &s;hould here be ob&s;erved, that air being an ela&s;tic fluid mu&s;t be more liable to eddies
than water, and that the&s;e eddies mu&s;t extend into cylinders or vortexes of greater
diameter, and that if a vertical eddy of north-ea&s;t air be of &s;mall diameter or has pa&s;&s;ed
but a little way to the &s;outh of us before its return, it will not have gained the velocity
of the earth's &s;urface to the &s;outh of us, and will in con&s;equence become a &s;outh-ea&s;t
wind.&mdash;But if the vertical eddy be of large diameter, or has pa&s;&s;ed much to the &s;outh of
us, it will have acquired velocity from its friction with the earth's &s;urface to the &s;outh

cold.</P>

<P>There &s;eem to be three &s;ources of the north-we&s;t winds of this hemi&s;phere of the
earth. 1. When a portion of &s;outhern air, which was pa&s;&s;ing over us, is driven back
by accumulation of new air in the polar regions. In this cafe I &s;uppo&s;e they are gene|rally
moi&s;t or rainy winds, with the barometer under 30, and if the wind had previou&s;ly
been in the &s;outh-we&s;t, it would &s;eem to progno&s;ticate a change to the north-ea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="318">
2. If a current of north wind is pa&s;&s;ing over us but a few miles high, without any
ea&s;terly direction; and is bent down upon us, it mu&s;t immediately po&s;&s;e&s;s a we&s;terly
direction, becau&s;e it will now move fa&s;ter than the &s;urface of the earth where it arrives;
and thus becomes changed from a north-ea&s;t to a north-we&s;t wind. This de&s;cent of a
north-ea&s;t current of air producing a north-we&s;t wind may continue &s;ome days with
clear or freezing weather, as it may be &s;imply owing to a vertical eddy of north-ea&s;t
air, as will be &s;poken of below. It may otherwi&s;e be forced down by a current of
&s;outh-we&s;t wind pa&s;&s;ing over it, and in this ca&s;e it will be attended with rain for a few
days by the mixture of the two airs of different degrees of heat; and will progno&s;ticate a
change of wind from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t if the wind was previou&s;ly in the north-ea&s;t
quarter.</P>
<P>3. On the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of North America the north-we&s;t winds bring fro&s;t, as the
north-ea&s;t winds do in this country, as appears from variety of te&s;timony. This &s;eems
to happen from a vertical &s;piral eddy made in the atmo&s;phere between the &s;hore and the
ridge of mountains which form the &s;pine or back-bone of that continent. If a current
of water runs along the hypothenu&s;e of a triangle an eddy will be made in the included
angle, which will turn round like a water-wheel as the &s;tream pa&s;&s;es in contact with
one edge of it. The &s;ame mu&s;t happen when a &s;heet of air flowing along from the
north-ea&s;t ri&s;es from the &s;hore in a &s;traight line to the &s;ummit of the Apalachian
mountains, a part of the &s;tream of north-ea&s;t air will flow over the mountains, another
part will revert and circulate &s;pirally between the &s;ummit of the country and the ea&s;tern
&s;hore, continuing to move toward the &s;outh; and thus be changed from a north-ea&s;t to
a north-we&s;t wind.</P>
<P>This vertical &s;piral eddy having been in contact with the cold &s;ummits of the&s;e
mountains, and de&s;cending from higher parts of the atmo&s;phere will lo&s;e part of its
heat, and thus con&s;titute one cau&s;e of the greater coldne&s;s of the ea&s;tern &s;ides of North
America than of the European &s;hores oppo&s;ite to them, which is &s;aid to be equal to
twelve degrees of north latitude, which is a wonderful fact, not otherwi&s;e ea&s;y to be
explained, &s;ince the heat of the &s;prings at Philadelphia is &s;aid to be 52, which is greater
than the medium heat of the earth in this country.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of vertical eddies, or great cylinders of air rolling on the &s;urface of
the earth, is agreeable to the ob&s;ervations of the con&s;tructors of windmills; who on
this idea place the area of the fails leaning backwards, inclined to the horizon; and
believe that then they have greater power than when they are placed quite perpen|dicularly.
The &s;ame kind of rolling cylinders of water obtain in rivers owing to the
friction of the water again&s;t the earth at their bottoms; as is known by bodies having
been ob&s;erved to float upon their &s;urfaces quicker than when immer&s;ed to a certain
depth. The&s;e vertical eddies of air probably exi&s;t all over the earth's &s;urface, but
particularly at the bottom or &s;ides of mountains; and more &s;o probably in the cour&s;e
of the &s;outh-we&s;t than of the north-ea&s;t winds; becau&s;e the former fall from an emi|nence,
as it were, on a part of the earth where there is a deficiency of the quantity of
air; as is &s;hewn by the &s;inking of the barometer: whereas the latter are pu&s;hed or
<PB N="85" REF="319">
&s;queezed forward by an addition to the atmo&s;phere behind them, as appears by the ri&s;ing
of the barometer.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>TRADE-WINDS.</HEAD>
<P>A column of heated air becomes lighter than before, and will therefore a&s;cend, by the
pre&s;&s;ure of the cold air which &s;urrounds it, like a cork in water, or like heated &s;moke in
a chimney.</P>
<P>Now as the &s;un pa&s;&s;es twice over the equator for once over either tropic, the equator
has not time to become cool; and on this account it is in general hotter at the line than
at the tropics; and therefore the air over the line, except in &s;ome few in&s;tances hereafter
to be mentioned, continues to a&s;cend at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, pre&s;&s;ed upwards by regions
of air brought from the tropics.</P>
<P>This air thus brought from the tropics to the equator, would con&s;titute a north wind
on one &s;ide of the equator, and a &s;outh wind on the other; but as the &s;urface of the earth
at the equator moves quicker than the &s;urface of the earth at the tropics, it is evident that
a region of air brought from either tropic to the equator, and which had previou&s;ly only
acquired the velocity of the earth's &s;urface at the tropics, will now move too flow for the
earth's &s;urface at the equator, and will thence appear to move in a direction contrary to
the motion of the earth. Hence the trade-winds, though they con&s;i&s;t of regions of air
brought from the north on one &s;ide of the line, and from the &s;outh on the other, will
appear to have the diagonal direction of north-ea&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t winds.</P>
<P>Now it is commonly believed that there are &s;uperior currents of air pa&s;&s;ing over the&s;e
north-ea&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t currents in a contrary direction, and which de&s;cending near
the tropics produce vertical whirlpools of air. An important que&s;tion here again pre|&s;ents
it&s;elf, <HI>What becomes of the moi&s;ture which this heated air ought to depo&s;it, as it cools
in the upper regions of the atmo&s;phere in its journey to the tropics?</HI> It has been &s;hewn by
Dr. Prie&s;tley and Mr. Ingenhouz that the green matter at the bottom of ci&s;terns, and the
fre&s;h leaves of plants immer&s;ed in water, give out con&s;iderable quantities of vital air in
the &s;un-&s;hine; that is, the per&s;pirable matter of plants (which is water much divided in
its egre&s;s from their minute pores) becomes decompo&s;ed by the &s;un's light, and converted
into two kinds of air, the vital and inflammable airs. The moi&s;ture contained or di&s;|&s;olved
in the a&s;cending heated air at the line mu&s;t exi&s;t in great tenuity; and by being
expo&s;ed to the great light of the &s;un in that climate, the water may be decompo&s;ed, and
the new airs &s;pread on the atmo&s;phere from the line to the poles.</P>
<P>1. From there being no con&s;tant depo&s;ition of rains in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of the trade-winds,
it would appear that the water ri&s;ing at the line is decompo&s;ed in its a&s;cent.</P>
<P>2. From the ob&s;ervations of M. Bougner on the mountain Pinchinca, one of the
Cordelieres immediately under the line, there appears to be no conden&s;ible vapour above
three or four miles high. Now though the atmo&s;phere at that height may be cold to a
very con&s;iderable degree; yet its total deprivation of conden&s;ible vapour would &s;eem to
&s;hew, that its water was decompo&s;ed; as there are no experiments to evince that any de|gree
of cold hitherto known has been able to deprive air of its moi&s;ture; and great
<PB N="86" REF="320">
abundance of &s;now is depo&s;ited from the air that flows to the polar regions, though it is
expo&s;ed to no greater degrees of cold in its journey thither than probably exi&s;ts at four
miles height in the atmo&s;phere at the line.</P>
<P>3. The hygrometer of Mr. Sau&s;&s;ure al&s;o pointed to dryne&s;s as he a&s;cended into rarer
air; the &s;ingle hair of which it was con&s;tructed, contracting from deficiency of moi&s;ture.
E&s;&s;ais &s;ur l'Hygromet. p. 143.</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations it appears either that rare and cold air requires more moi&s;ture
to &s;aturate it than den&s;e air; or that the moi&s;ture becomes decompo&s;ed and converted
into air, as it a&s;cends into there cold and rare regions of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>4. There &s;eems &s;ome analogy between the circum&s;tance of air being produced or
generated in the cold parts of the atmo&s;phere both at the line and at the poles.</P>

<HEAD>MONSOONS AND TORNADOES.</HEAD>
<P>1. In the Arabian and Indian &s;eas are winds, which blow fix months one way, and
&s;ix months the other, and are called Mon&s;oons; by the accidental di&s;po&s;itions of land
and &s;ea it happens, that in &s;ome places the air near the tropic is &s;uppo&s;ed to become
warmer when the &s;un is vertical over it, than at the line. The air in the&s;e places con|&s;equently
a&s;cends pre&s;&s;ed upon one &s;ide by the north-ea&s;t regions of air, and on the other
&s;ide by the &s;outh-we&s;t regions of air. For as the air brought from the &s;outh has pre|viou&s;ly
obtained the velocity of the earth's &s;urface at the line, it moves fa&s;ter than the
earth's &s;urface near the tropic where it now arrives, and becomes a &s;outh-we&s;t wind,
while the air from the north becomes a north-ea&s;t wind as before explained. The&s;e two
winds do not &s;o quietly join and a&s;cend as the north-ea&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t winds, which
meet at the line with equal warmth and velocity and form the trade-winds; but as they
meet in contrary directions before they a&s;cend, and cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed accurately to ba|lance
each other, a rotatory motion will be produced as they a&s;cend like water falling
through a hole, and an horizontal or &s;piral eddy is the con&s;equence; the&s;e eddies are more
or le&s;s rapid, and are called Tornadoes in their mo&s;t violent &s;tate, rai&s;ing water from the
ocean in the we&s;t or &s;and from the de&s;erts of the ea&s;t, in le&s;s violent degrees they only
mix together the two currents of north-ea&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t air, and produce by this
means ince&s;&s;ant rains, as the air of the north-ea&s;t acquires &s;ome of the heat from the
&s;outh-we&s;t wind, as explained in Note XXV. This circum&s;tance of the eddies produced
by the mon&s;oon-winds was &s;een by Mr. Bruce in Aby&s;&s;inia; he relates that for many
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive mornings at the commencement of the rainy mon&s;oon, he ob&s;erved a cloud
of apparently &s;mall dimen&s;ions whirling round with great rapidity, and in a few minutes
the heavens became covered with dark clouds with con&s;equent great rains. See Note on
Canto III. l. 125.</P>
<P>2. But it is not only at the place where the air a&s;cends at the northern extremity of
the rainy mon&s;oon, and where it forms tornadoes, as ob&s;erved above by Mr. Bruce, but
over a great tract of country &s;everal degrees in length in certain parts as in the Arabian
&s;ea, a perpetual rain for &s;everal months de&s;cends, &s;imilar to what happens for weeks to|gether
in our own climate in a le&s;s degree during the &s;outh-we&s;t winds. Another important
<PB N="87" REF="321">
que&s;tion pre&s;ents it&s;elf here, <HI>If the climate to which this &s;outh-we&s;t wind arrives,
is not colder than that it comes from, why &s;hould it depo&s;it its moi&s;ture during its whole
journey? if it be a colder climate, why does it come thither?</HI> The tornadoes of air
above de&s;cribed can extend but a little way, and it is not ea&s;y to conceive that a &s;u|perior
cold current of air can mix with an inferior one, and thus produce &s;howers over
ten degrees of country, &s;ince at about three miles high there is perpetual fro&s;t; and what
can induce the&s;e narrow and &s;hallow currents to flow over each other &s;o many hundred
miles?</P>
<P>Though the earth at the northren extremity of this mon&s;oon may be more heated by
certain circum&s;tances of &s;ituation than at the line, yet it &s;eems probable that the interme|diate
country between that and the line, may continue colder than the line (as in other
parts of the earth) and hence that the air coming from the line to &s;upply this a&s;cent or
de&s;truction of air at the northern extremity of the mon&s;oon will be cooled all the way in
its approach, and in con&s;equence depo&s;it its water. It &s;eems probable that at the northern
extremity of this mon&s;oon, where the tornadoes or hurricanes exi&s;t, that the air not only
a&s;cends but is in part converted into water, or otherwi&s;e dimini&s;hed in quantity, as no
account is given of the exi&s;tence of any &s;uperior currents of it.</P>
<P>As the &s;outh-we&s;t winds are always attended with a light atmo&s;phere, an incipient
vacancy, or a great diminution of air mu&s;t have taken place to the northward of them in
all parts of the earth wherever they exi&s;t, and a depo&s;ition of their moi&s;ture &s;ucceeds
their being cooled by the climate they arrive at, and not by a contrary current of cold air
over them, &s;ince in that ca&s;e the barometer would not &s;ink. They may thus in our own
country be termed mon&s;oons without very regular periods.</P>
<P>3. Another cau&s;e of TORNADOES independent of the mon&s;oons is ingeniou&s;ly ex|plained
by Dr. Franklin; when in the tropical countries a &s;tratum of inferior air becomes
&s;o heated by its contact with the warm earth, that its expan&s;ion is increa&s;ed more
than is equivalent to the pre&s;&s;ure of the &s;tratum of air over it; or when the &s;uperior
&s;tratum becomes more conden&s;ed by cold than the inferior one by pre&s;&s;ure, the upper
region will de&s;cend and the lower one a&s;cend. In this &s;ituation if one part of the atmos|phere
be hotter from &s;ome fortuitous circum&s;tances, or, has le&s;s pre&s;&s;ure over it, the
lower &s;tratum will begin to a&s;cend at this part, and re&s;emble water falling through a hole
as mentioned above. If the lower region of air was going forwards with con&s;iderable
velocity, it will gain an eddy by ri&s;ing up this hole in the incumbent heavy air, &s;o that
the whirlpool or tornado has not only its progre&s;&s;ive velocity, but its circular one al&s;o,
which thus lifts up or overturns every thing within its &s;piral whirl. By the weaker
whirlwinds in this country the trees are &s;ometimes thrown down in a line of only twenty
or forty yards in breadth, making a kind of avenue through a country. In the We&s;t
Indies the &s;ea ri&s;es like a cone in the whirl, and is met by black clouds produced by the
cold upper air and the warm lower air being rapidly mixed; whence are produced the
great and &s;udden rains called water-&s;pouts; while the upper and lower airs exchange
their plus or minus electricity in perpetual lightenings.</P>

<P>The &s;ea being a tran&s;parent ma&s;s is le&s;s heated at its &s;urface by the &s;un's rays than
the land, and its continual change of &s;urface contributes to pre&s;erve a greater uniformity
in the heat of the air which hangs over it. Hence the &s;urface of the tropical i&s;lands is
more heated during the day than the &s;ea that &s;urrounds them, and cools more in the
night by its greater elevation: whence in the afternoon when the lands of the tropical
i&s;lands have been much heated by the &s;un, the air over them a&s;cends pre&s;&s;ed upwards by
the cooler air of the incircling ocean, in the morning again the land becoming cooled
more than the &s;ea, the air over it de&s;cends by its increa&s;ed gravity, and blows over the

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>1. There are various irregular winds be&s;ides tho&s;e above de&s;cribed, which con&s;i&s;t of
horizontal or vertical eddies of air owing to the inequality of the earth's &s;urface, or the
juxtapo&s;ition of the &s;ea. Other irregular winds have their origin from increa&s;ed evapora|tion
of water, or its &s;udden devaporation and de&s;cent in &s;howers; others from the partial
expan&s;ion and conden&s;ation of air by heat and cold; by the accumulation or defect of
electric fluid, or to the air's new production or ab&s;orption occa&s;ioned by local cau&s;es
not yet di&s;covered. See Notes VII. and XXV.</P>
<P>2. There &s;eem to exi&s;t only two original winds: one con&s;i&s;ting of air brought from
the north, and the other of air brought from the &s;outh. The former of the&s;e winds has
al&s;o generally an apparent direction from the ea&s;t, and the latter from the we&s;t, ari&s;ing
from the different velocities of the earth's &s;urface. All the other winds above de&s;cribed
are deflections or retrogre&s;&s;ions of &s;ome parts of the&s;e currents of air from the north or
&s;outh.</P>
<P>3. One fifteenth part of the atmo&s;phere is occa&s;ionally de&s;troyed, and occa&s;ionally re|produced
by unknown cau&s;es. The&s;e cau&s;es are brought into immediate activity over a
great part of the &s;urface of the earth at nearly the &s;ame time, but always act more power|ful
to the northward than to the &s;outhward of any given place; and would hence &s;eem
to have their principal effect in the polar circles, exi&s;ting neverthele&s;s though with le&s;s
power toward the tropics or at the line.</P>
<P>For when the north-ea&s;t wind blows the barometer ri&s;es, &s;ometimes from 28 &frac12; inches
to 30 &frac12;, which &s;hews a great new generation of air in the north; and when the &s;outh|we&s;t
wind blows the barometer &s;inks as much, which &s;hews a great de&s;truction of air in
the north. But as the north-ea&s;t winds &s;ometimes continue for five or &s;ix weeks, the
newly-generated air mu&s;t be de&s;troyed at tho&s;e times in the warmer climates to the &s;outh
of us, or circulate in &s;uperior currents, which has been &s;hewn to be improbable from its
not depo&s;iting its water. And as the &s;outh-we&s;t winds &s;ometimes continue for &s;ome
weeks, there mu&s;t be a generation of air to the &s;outh at tho&s;e times, or &s;uperior currents,
which la&s;t has been &s;hewn to be improbable.</P>
<P>4. The north-ea&s;t winds being generated about the poles are pu&s;hed forwards towards
the tropics or line, by the pre&s;&s;ure from behind, and hence they become warmer, as
<PB N="89" REF="323">
explained in Note VII. as well as by their coming into contact with a warmer part of
the earth which contributes to make the&s;e winds greedily ab&s;orb moi&s;ture in their pa&s;&s;age.
On the contrary, the &s;outh-we&s;t winds, as the atmo&s;phere is &s;uddenly dimini&s;hed in the
polar regions, are drawn as it were into an incipient vacancy, and become therefore
expanded in their pa&s;&s;age, and thus generate cold, as explained in Note VII. and are
thus induced to part with their moi&s;ture, as well as by their contact with a colder
part of the earth's &s;urface. Add to this, that the difference in the &s;ound of the north-ea&s;t
and &s;outh-we&s;t winds may depend on the former being pu&s;hed forwards by a pre&s;&s;ure
behind, and the latter falling as it were into a partial or incipient vacancy before;
whence the former becomes more conden&s;ed, and the latter more rarefied as it pa&s;&s;es.
There is a whi&s;tle, termed a lark-call, which con&s;i&s;ts of a hollow cylinder of tin-plate,
clo&s;ed at each end, about half an inch in diameter and a quarter of an inch high, with
oppo&s;ite holes about the &s;ize of a goo&s;e-quill through the centre of each end; if this lark-whi&s;tle
be held between the lips the &s;ound of it is manife&s;tly different when the breath
is forceably blown through it from within outwards, and when it is &s;ucked from
without inwards. Perhaps this might be worthy the attention of organ-builders.</P>
<P>5. A &s;top is put to this new generation of air, when about a fifteenth of the whole is
produced, by its increa&s;ing pre&s;&s;ure; and a &s;imilar boundary is fixed to its ab&s;orption or
de&s;truction by the decrea&s;e of atmo&s;pheric pre&s;&s;ure. As water requires more heat to
convert it into vapour under a heavy atmo&s;phere than under a light one, &s;o in letting off
the water from muddy fi&s;h-ponds great quantities of air-bubbles are &s;een to a&s;cend from
the bottom, which were previou&s;ly confined there by the pre&s;&s;ure of the water. Similar
bubbles of inflammable air are &s;een to ari&s;e from lakes in many &s;ea&s;ons of the year,
when the atmo&s;phere &s;uddenly becomes light.</P>
<P>6. The increa&s;ed ab&s;orptions and evolutions of air mu&s;t, like its &s;imple expan&s;ions,
depend much on the pre&s;ence or ab&s;ence of heat and light, and will hence, in re&s;pect
to the times and places of its production and de&s;truction, be governed by the approach
or retroce&s;&s;ion of the &s;un, and on the temperature, in regard to heat, of various latitudes,
and parts of the &s;ame latitude, &s;o well explained by Mr. Kirwan.</P>
<P>7. Though the immediate cau&s;e of the de&s;truction or reproduction of great ma&s;&s;es
of air at certain times, when the wind changes from north to &s;outh, or from &s;outh to
north can not yet be a&s;certained; yet as there appears greater difficulty in accounting for
this change of wind for any other known cau&s;es, we may &s;till &s;u&s;pect that there exi&s;ts in
the arctic and antarctic circles a BEAR or DRAGON yet unknown to philo&s;ophers, which
at times &s;uddenly drinks up, and as &s;uddenly at other times vomits out one-fifteenth
part of the atmo&s;phere: and hope that this or &s;ome future age will learn how to govern
and dome&s;ticate a mon&s;ter which might be rendered of &s;uch important &s;ervice to mankind.</P>

<HEAD>INSTRUMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>IF along with the u&s;ual regi&s;ters of the weather ob&s;ervations were made on the
winds in many parts of the earth with the three following in&s;truments, which might be
con&s;tructed at no great expence, &s;ome u&s;eful information might be acquired.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="324">
1. To mark the hour when the wind changes from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t, and the
contrary. This might be managed by making a communication from the vane of a
weathercock to a clock; in &s;uch a manner, that if the vane &s;hould revolve quite round,
a tooth on its revolving axis &s;hould &s;top the clock, or put back a &s;mall bolt on the edge
of a wheel revolving once in twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>2. To di&s;cover whether in a year more air pa&s;&s;ed from north to &s;outh, or the con|trary.
This might be effected by placing a windmill-&s;ail of copper about nine inches
diameter in a hollow cylinder about &s;ix inches long, open at both ends, and fixed on an
eminent &s;ituation exactly north and &s;outh. Thence only a part of the north-ea&s;t and
&s;outh-we&s;t currents would affect the &s;ail &s;o as to turn it; and if its revolutions were
counted by an adapted machinery, as the &s;ail would turn one way with the north
currents of air, and the contrary one with the &s;outh currents, the advance of the
counting finger either way would &s;hew which wind had prevailed mo&s;t at the end of
the year.</P>
<P>3. To di&s;cover the rolling cylinders of air, the vane of a weathercock might be &s;o
&s;u&s;pended as to dip or ri&s;e vertically, as well as to have its horizontal rotation.</P>

<HEAD>RECAPITULATION.</HEAD>
<P>NORTH-EAST WINDS con&s;i&s;t of air flowing from the north, where it &s;eems to be

over us, driven back by a new accumulation of air in the north. The&s;e continue but
a day or two, and are attended with rain. See Note XXV.</P>
<P>SOUTH-WEST WIND con&s;i&s;ts of air flowing from the &s;outh, and &s;eems occa&s;ionally
ab&s;orbed at its arrival to the more northern latitudes. It has a real direction from the
we&s;t owing to its not having lo&s;t in its journey the greater velocity it had acquired from
the earth's &s;urface from whence it came. The&s;e winds are analogous to the mon&s;oons
between the tropics, and frequently continue for four or &s;ix weeks together, with a
low barometer and rainy weather. 2. They &s;ometimes con&s;i&s;t of north-ea&s;t air, which
had pa&s;&s;ed by us or over us, which becomes retrograde by a commencing deficiency of
air in the north. The&s;e winds continue but a day or two, attended with &s;everer fro&s;t
with a &s;inking barometer; their cold being increa&s;ed by their expan&s;ion, as they return,
into an incipient vacancy.</P>
<P>NORTH-WEST WINDS con&s;i&s;t, fir&s;t, of &s;outh-we&s;t winds, which have pa&s;&s;ed over us,
bent down and driven back towards the &s;outh by newly generated northern air. They
continue but a day or two, and are attended with rain or clouds. 2. They con&s;i&s;t of

acquired a greater velocity than the earth's &s;urface; are fro&s;ty or fair. 3. They con&s;i&s;t of

<P>EAST WINDS con&s;i&s;t of air brought ha&s;tily from the north, and not impelled farther

<HEAD>Application of the preceding Theory to &s;ome Extracts from a Journal of the
Weather.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 1, 1790. The barometer &s;unk &s;uddenly, and the wind, which had been &s;ome
days north-ea&s;t with fro&s;t, changed to &s;outh-ea&s;t with an ince&s;&s;ant though moderate
fall of &s;now. A part of the northern air, which had pa&s;&s;ed by us I &s;uppo&s;e, now
became retrograde before it had acquired the velocity of the earth's &s;urface to the &s;outh
of us, and being attended by &s;ome of the &s;outhern air in its journey, the moi&s;ture of the
latter became conden&s;ed and frozen by its mixture mith the former.</P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 2, 3. The wind changed to north-we&s;t and thawed the &s;now. A part of the
&s;outhern air, which had pa&s;&s;ed by us or over us, with the retrograde northern air above
de&s;cribed, was now in its turn driven back, before it had lo&s;t the velocity of the &s;urface
of the earth to the &s;outh of us, and con&s;equently became a north-we&s;t wind; and not
having lo&s;t the warmth it brought from the &s;outh produced a thaw.</P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 4, 5. Wind changed to north-ea&s;t with fro&s;t and a ri&s;ing barometer. The air
from the north continuing to blow, after it had driven back the &s;outhern air as above
de&s;cribed, became a north-ea&s;t wind, having le&s;s velocity than the &s;urface of the earth in
this climate, and produced fro&s;t from its coldne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="326">
<HI>Dec.</HI> 6, 7. Wind now changed to the &s;outh-we&s;t with ince&s;&s;ant rain and a &s;inking
barometer. From unknown cau&s;es I &s;uppo&s;e the quantity of air to be dimini&s;hed in the
polar regions, and the &s;outhern air cooled by the earth's &s;urface, which was previou&s;ly
frozen, depo&s;its its moi&s;ture for a day or two; afterwards the wind continued &s;outh-we&s;t
without rain, as the &s;urface of the earth became warmer.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 18, 1785. There has been a long fro&s;t; a few days ago the barometer &s;unk
to 29 &frac12;, and the fro&s;t became more &s;evere. Becau&s;e the air being expanded by a part of
the pre&s;&s;ure being taken off became colder. This day the mercury ro&s;e to 30, and the
fro&s;t cea&s;ed, the wind continuing as before between north and ea&s;t. <HI>March</HI> 19. Mercury
above 30, weather &s;till milder, no fro&s;t, wind north-ea&s;t. <HI>March</HI> 20. The &s;ame, for
the mercury ri&s;ing &s;hews that the air becomes more compre&s;&s;ed by the weight above&punc;
and in con&s;equence gives out warmth.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 4, 5. Fro&s;t, wind north-ea&s;t, the wind changed in the middle of the day to the
north-we&s;t without rain, and has done &s;o for three or four days, becoming again north-ea&s;t
at night. For the &s;un now giving greater degrees of heat, the air a&s;cends as the
&s;un pa&s;&s;es the zenith, and is &s;upplied below by the air on the we&s;tern &s;ide as well as on
the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the zenith during the hot part of the day; whence for a few hours, on
the approach of the hot part of the day, the air acquires a we&s;terly direction in this
longitude. If the north-we&s;t wind had been cau&s;ed by a retrograde motion of &s;ome
&s;outhern air, which had pa&s;&s;ed over us, it would have been attended with rain or clouds.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 10. It rained all day ye&s;terday, the wind north-we&s;t, this morning there was a
&s;harp fro&s;t. The evaporation of the moi&s;ture, (which fell ye&s;terday) occa&s;ioned by the
continuance of the wind, produced &s;o much cold as to freeze the dew.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 12. Frequent &s;howers with a current of colder wind preceding every &s;hower.
The &s;inking of the rain or cloud pre&s;&s;ed away the air from beneath it in its de&s;cent,
which having been for a time &s;haded from the &s;un by the floating cloud, became cooled
in &s;ome degree.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 20. The barometer &s;unk, the wind became &s;outh-we&s;t, and the whole heaven
was in&s;tantly covered with clouds. A part of the incumbent atmo&s;phere having
vani&s;hed, as appeared by the &s;inking of the barometer, the remainder became expanded
by its ela&s;ticity, and thence attracted &s;ome of the matter of heat from the vapour inter|mixed
with it, and thus in a few minutes a total devaporation took place, as in ex|hau&s;ting
the receiver of an air-pump. See note XXV. At the place where the air is
de&s;troyed, currents both from the north and &s;outh flow in to &s;upply the deficiency, (for
it has been &s;hewn that there are no other proper winds but the&s;e two) and the mixture
of the&s;e winds produces &s;o &s;udden conden&s;ation of the moi&s;ture, both by the coldne&s;s of
the northern air and the expan&s;ion of both of them, that lightning is given out, and an
incipient tornado takes place; whence thunder is &s;aid frequently to approach again&s;t the
wind.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 28, 1732. Barometer was at 31, and <HI>Dec.</HI> 30, in the &s;ame year, it was at
28 2-tenths. Medical E&s;&s;ays, Edinburgh, Vol. II. p. 7. It appears from the&s;e journals
that the mercury at Edinburgh varies &s;ometimes nearly three inches, or one tenth of
<PB N="93" REF="327">
the whole atmo&s;phere. From the journals kept by the Royal Society at London it
appears &s;eldom to vary more than two inches, or one-fifteenth of the whole atmo&s;phere.
The quantity of the variation is &s;aid &s;till to decrea&s;e nearer the line, and to increa&s;e in
the more northern latitudes; which much confirms the idea that there exi&s;ts at certain
times a great de&s;truction or production of air within the polar circle.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 2, 1732. The we&s;terly winds in the journal in the Medical E&s;&s;ays, Vol. II.
above referred to, are frequently marked with the number three to &s;hew their greater
velocity, whereas the ea&s;terly winds &s;eldom approach to the number two. The greater
velocity of the we&s;terly winds than the ea&s;terly ones is well known I believe in every
climate of the world; which may be thus explained from the theory above delivered.
1. When the air is &s;till, the higher parts of the atmo&s;phere move quicker than tho&s;e
parts which touch the earth, becau&s;e they are at a greater di&s;tance from the axis of
motion. 2. The part of the atmo&s;phere where the north or &s;outh wind comes from
is higher than the part of it where it comes to, hence the more elevated parts of the
atmo&s;phere continue to de&s;cend towards the earth as either of tho&s;e winds approach.
3. When &s;outhern air is brought to us it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a we&s;terly direction al&s;o, owing to
the velocity it had previou&s;ly acquired from the earth's &s;urface; and if it con&s;i&s;ts of air
from the higher parts of the atmo&s;phere de&s;cending nearer the earth, this we&s;terly
velocity becomes increa&s;ed. But when northern air is brought to us, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an
apparent ea&s;terly direction al&s;o, owing to the velocity which it had previou&s;ly acquired
from the earth's &s;urface being le&s;s than that of the earth's &s;urface in this latitude; now if
the north-ea&s;t wind con&s;i&s;ts of air de&s;cending from higher parts of the atmo&s;phere, this
deficiency of velocity will be le&s;s, in con&s;equence of the &s;ame cau&s;e, viz. The higher
parts of the atmo&s;phere de&s;cending, as the wind approaches, increa&s;es the real velocity of
the we&s;tern winds, and decrea&s;es the apparent velocity of the ea&s;tern ones.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 22. Wind changed from &s;outh-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t. There is a popular prog|no&s;tication
that if the wind changes from the north towards the &s;outh pa&s;&s;ing through
the ea&s;t, it is more likely to continue in the &s;outh, than if it pa&s;&s;es through the we&s;t,
which may be thus accounted for. If the north-ea&s;t wind changes to a north-we&s;t
wind, it &s;hews either that a part of the northern air de&s;cends upon us in a &s;piral eddy,
or that a &s;uperior current of &s;outhern air is driven back; but if a north-ea&s;t wind be
changed into a &s;outh-ea&s;t wind it &s;hews that the northern air is become retrograde, and
that in a day or two, as &s;oon as that part of it has pa&s;&s;ed, which has not gained the
velocity of the earth's &s;urface in this latitude, it will become a &s;outh wind for a few
hours, and then a &s;outh-we&s;t wind.</P>
<P>The writer of this imperfect &s;ketch of anemology wi&s;hes it may incite &s;ome per&s;on of
greater leizure and ability to attend to this &s;ubject, and by comparing the various meteo|rological
journals and ob&s;ervations already publi&s;hed, to con&s;truct a more accurate and
methodical treati&s;e on this intere&s;ting branch of philo&s;ophy.</P>

<Q><L>And wed the enamoured Oxygene to Light. </L><BIBL><HI>CANTO IV.</HI> l. 34.</BIBL></Q>
<P>WHEN points or hairs are put into &s;pring-water, as in the experiments of Sir B.
Thomp&s;on, (Philo&s;. Tran&s;. Vol. LXXVII.) and expo&s;ed to the light of the &s;un, much
air, which loo&s;ely adhered to the water, ri&s;es in bubbles, as explained in note on Fucus,
Vol. II. A &s;till greater quantity of air, and of a purer kind, is emitted by Dr. Prie&s;tley's
green matter, and by vegetable leaves growing in water in the &s;un-&s;hine, according to
Mr. Ingenhouze's experiments; both which I &s;u&s;pect to be owing to a decompo&s;ition of
the water per&s;pired by the plant, for the edge of a capillary tube of great tenuity may be
con&s;idered as a circle of points, and as the oxygene, or principle of vital air, may be ex|panded
into a gas by the &s;un's light; the hydrogene or inflammable air may be detained
in the pores of the vegetable.</P>
<P>Hence plants growing in the &s;hade are white, and become green by being expo&s;ed to
the &s;un's light; for their natural colour being blue, the addition of hydrogene adds
yellow to this blue, and <HI>tans</HI> them green. I &s;uppo&s;e a &s;imilar circum&s;tance takes place
in animal bodies; their per&s;pirable matter as it e&s;capes in the &s;un-&s;hine becomes decom|po&s;ed
by the edges of their pores as in vegetables, though in le&s;s quantity, as their per|&s;piration
is le&s;s, and by the hydrogene being retained the &s;kin becomes <HI>tanned</HI> yellow.
In proof of this it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that both vegetable and animal &s;ub&s;tances become
bleached white by the &s;un-beams when they are dead, as cabbage-&s;talks, bones, ivory,
tallow, bees-wax, linen and cotton cloth; and hence I &s;uppo&s;e the copper-coloured
natives of &s;unny countries might become etiolated or blanched by being kept from their
infancy in the dark, or removed for a few generations to more northerly climates.</P>
<P>It is probable that on a &s;unny morning much pure air becomes &s;eparated from the
dew by means of the points of vegetables on which it adheres, and much inflammable
air imbibed by the vegetable, or combined with it; and by the &s;un's light thus decom|po&s;ing
water the effects of it in bleaching linen &s;eems to depend (as de&s;cribed in
Note X.): the water is decompo&s;ed by the light at the ends or points of the cotton or
thread, and the vital air unites with the phlogi&s;tic or colouring matters of the cloth,
and produces a new acid, which is either it&s;elf colourle&s;s or wa&s;hes out, at the &s;ame
time the inflammable part of the water e&s;capes. Hence there &s;eems a rea&s;on why cotton
bleaches &s;o much &s;ooner than linen, viz. becau&s;e its fibres are three or four times
&s;horter, and therefore protrude &s;o many more points, which &s;eem to facilitate the
liberation of the vital air from the inflammable part of the water.</P>
<P>Bee's wax becomes bleached by expo&s;ure to the &s;un and dews in a &s;imilar manner as
metals become calcined or ru&s;ty, viz. by the water on their &s;urface being decompo&s;ed;
and hence the inflammable material which cau&s;ed the colour becomes united with vital
air forming a new acid, and is wa&s;hed away.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="329">
Oil clo&s;e &s;topped in a phial not full, and expo&s;ed long to the &s;un's light, becomes
bleached, as I &s;uppo&s;e, by the decompo&s;ition of the water it contains; the inflammable
air ri&s;ing above the &s;urface, and the vital air uniting with the colouring matter of the oil.
For it is remarkable, that by &s;hutting up a phial of bleached oil in a dark drawer, it in a
little time becomes coloured again.</P>
<P>The following experiment &s;hews the power of light in &s;eparating vital air from
another ba&s;is, viz. from azote. Mr. Scheel inverted a gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el filled with colourle&s;s
nitrous acid into another gla&s;s containing the &s;ame acid, and on expo&s;ing them to the
&s;un's light, the inverted gla&s;s became partly filled with pure air, and the acid at the &s;ame
time became coloured. Scheel in Crell's Annal. 1786. But if the ve&s;&s;el of colourle&s;s
nitrous acid be quite full and &s;topped, &s;o that no &s;pace is left for the air produced to ex|pand
it&s;elf into, no change of colour takes place. Prie&s;tley's Exp. VI. p. 344. See Keir's
very excellent Chemical Dictionary, p. 99. new edition.</P>
<P>A &s;un-flower three feet and half high according to the experiment of Dr. Hales, per|&s;pired
two pints in one day (Vegetable Statics.) which is many times as much in pro|portion
to its &s;urface, as is per&s;pired from the &s;urface and lungs of animal bodies; it
follows that the vital air liberated from the &s;urfaces of plants by the &s;un&s;hine mu&s;t much
exceed the quantity of it ab&s;orbed by their re&s;piration, and that hence they improve the air
in which they live during the light part of the day, and thus blanched vegetables will
&s;ooner become <HI>tanned into green</HI> by the &s;un's light, than etiolated animal bodies will be|come
<HI>tanned yellow</HI> by the &s;ame means.</P>
<P>It is hence evident, that the curious di&s;covery of Dr. Prie&s;tley, that his green vegetable
matter and other aquatic plants gave out vital air when the &s;un &s;hone upon them, and
the leaves of other plants did the &s;ame when immer&s;ed in water, as ob&s;erved by Mr.
Ingenhouze, refer to the per&s;piration of vegetables not to their re&s;piration. Becau&s;e Dr.
Prie&s;tley ob&s;erved the pure air to come from both &s;ides of the leaves and even from the
&s;talks of a water-flag, whereas one &s;ide of the leaf only &s;erves the of the office of lungs, and
certainly not the &s;talks. Exper. on Air, Vol. III. And thus in re&s;pect to the circum|&s;tance
in which plants and animals &s;eemed the furthere&s;t removed from each other, I
mean in their &s;uppo&s;ed mode of re&s;piration, by which one was believed to purify the air
which the other had injured, they &s;eem to differ only in degree, and the analogy between
them remains unbroken.</P>
<P>Plants are &s;aid by many writers to grow much fa&s;ter in the night than in the day; as
is particularly ob&s;ervable in &s;eedlings at their ri&s;ing out of the ground. This probably
is a con&s;equence of their &s;leep rather than of the ab&s;ence of light; and in this I &s;uppo&s;e
they al&s;o re&s;emble animal bodies.</P>

<Q><L>While in bright veins the &s;ilvery &s;ap a&s;cends.</L> <BIBL><HI>CANTO IV.</HI> l. 419.</BIBL></Q>
<P>AS buds are the viviparous offspring of vegetables, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary that
they &s;hould be furni&s;hed with placental ve&s;&s;els for their nouri&s;hment, till they acquire
lungs or leaves for the purpo&s;e of elaborating the common juices of the earth into nutri|ment.
The&s;e ve&s;&s;els exi&s;t in bulbs and in &s;eeds, and &s;upply the young plant with a
&s;weet juice till it acquires leaves, as is &s;een in converting barley into malt, and appears
from the &s;weet ta&s;te of onions and potatoes, when they begin to grow.</P>
<P>The placental ve&s;&s;els belonging to the buds of trees are placed about the roots of
mo&s;t, as the vine; &s;o many roots are furni&s;hed with &s;weet or mealy matter as fern-root,
bryony, carrot, turnip, potatoe, or in the alburnum or &s;ap-wood as in tho&s;e trees which
produce manna, which is depo&s;ited about the month of Augu&s;t, or in the joints of &s;ugar
cane, and gra&s;&s;es; early in the &s;pring the ab&s;orbent mouths of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els drink up
moi&s;ture from the earth, with a &s;accharine matter lodged for that purpo&s;e during the
preceding autumn, and pu&s;h this nutritive fluid up the ve&s;&s;els of the alburnum to every
individual bud, as is evinced by the experiments of Dr. Hales, and of Mr. Walker in the
Edinburgh Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;act. The former ob&s;erved that the &s;ap from the &s;tump
of a vine, which he had cut off in the beginning of April, aro&s;e twenty-one feet high in
tubes affixed to it for that purpo&s;e, but in a few weeks it cea&s;ed to bleed at all, and Dr.
Walker marked the progre&s;s of the a&s;cending &s;ap, and found likewi&s;e that as &s;oon as
the leaves became expanded the &s;ap cea&s;ed to ri&s;e; the a&s;cending juice of &s;ome trees is &s;o
copious and &s;o &s;weet during the &s;ap-&s;ea&s;on that it is u&s;ed to make wine, as the birch,
betula, and &s;ycamore, acer p&s;eudo-platinus, and particularly the palm.</P>
<P>During this a&s;cent of the &s;ap-juice each individual leaf-bud expands its new leaves, and
&s;hoots down new roots, covering by their intertexture the old bark with a new one;
and as &s;oon as the&s;e new roots (or bark) are capable of ab&s;orbing &s;ufficient juices from
the earth for the &s;upport of each bud, and the new leaves are capable of performing their
office of expo&s;ing the&s;e juices to the influence of the air; the placental ve&s;&s;els cea&s;e
to act, coale&s;ce, and are tran&s;formed from &s;ap-wood, or alburnum, into inert wood;
&s;erving only for the &s;upport of the new tree, which grows over them.</P>
<P>Thus from the pith of the new bud of the hor&s;e-che&s;nut five ve&s;&s;els pa&s;s out through
the circle of the placental ve&s;&s;els above de&s;cribed, and carry with them a minuter circle
of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els; the&s;e five bundles of ve&s;&s;els unite after their exit, and form the foot|&s;talk
or petiole of the new five-fingered leaf, to be &s;poken of hereafter. This &s;tructure
is well &s;een by cutting off a leaf of the hor&s;e-che&s;nut (Ae&s;culus Hippoca&s;tanum) in
September before it falls, as the buds of this tree are &s;o large that the flower may be &s;een
in them with the naked eye.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="331">
After a time, perhaps about mid&s;ummer, another bundle of ve&s;&s;els pa&s;&s;es from the
pith through the alburnum or &s;ap-ve&s;&s;els in the bo&s;om of each leaf, and unites by the
new bark with the leaf, which becomes either a flower-bud or a leaf-bud to be expanded
in the en&s;uing &s;pring, for which purpo&s;e an apparatus of placental ve&s;&s;els are produced
with proper nutriment during the progre&s;s of the &s;ummer and autumn, and thus
the vegetable becomes annually increa&s;ed, ten thou&s;and buds often exi&s;ting on one tree,
according to the e&s;timate of Linneus. Phil. Bot.</P>
<P>The va&s;cular connection of vegetable buds with the leaves in who&s;e bo&s;oms they are
formed is confirmed by the following experiment, (<HI>Oct.</HI> 20, 1781.) On the extremity
of a young bud of the Mimo&s;a (&s;en&s;itive plant) a &s;mall drop of acid of vitriol was put by
means of a pen, and, after a few &s;econds, the leaf in who&s;e axilla it dwelt clo&s;ed and
opened no more, though the drop of vitriolic acid was &s;o &s;mall as apparently only to
injure the &s;ummit of the bud. Does not this &s;eem to &s;hew that the leaf and its bud
have connecting ve&s;&s;els though they ari&s;e at different times and from different parts of
the medulla or pith? And, as it exi&s;ts previou&s;ly to it, that the leaf is the parent of
the bud?</P>
<P>This placentation of vegetable buds is clearly evinced from the &s;weetne&s;s of the
ri&s;ing &s;ap, and from its cea&s;ing to ri&s;e as &s;oon as the leaves are expanded, and thus
compleats the analogy between buds and bulbs. Nor need we wonder at the length
of the umbilical cords of buds &s;ince that mu&s;t corre&s;pond with their &s;ituation on
the tree, in the &s;ame manner as their lymphatics and arteries are proportionally
elongated.</P>
<P>It does not appear probable that any umbilical artery attends the&s;e placental ab|&s;orbents,
&s;ince, as there &s;eems to be no &s;y&s;tem of veins in vegetables to bring back
the blood from the extremities of their arteries, (except their pulmonary veins,) there
could not be any vegetable fluids to be returned to their placenta, which in vege|tables
&s;eems to be &s;imply an organ for nutrition, whereas the placenta of the animal
foetus &s;eems likewi&s;e to &s;erve as a re&s;piratory organ like the gills of fi&s;hes.</P>

<Q><L>And refluent blood in milky eddies bends.</L> <BIBL><HI>CANTO IV.</HI> l. 420.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE individuality of vegetable buds was &s;poken of before, and is confirmed by the
method of rai&s;ing all kinds of trees by Mr. Barnes. (Method of propagating Fruit Trees.
1759. Lond. Baldwin.) He cut a branch into as many pieces as there were buds or
leaves upon it, and wiping the two wounded ends dry he quickly applied to each a
cement, previou&s;ly warmed a little, which con&s;i&s;ted principally of pitch, and planted them
in the earth. The u&s;e of this cement I &s;uppo&s;e to con&s;i&s;t in its preventing the bud from
bleeding to death, though the author a&s;cribes it to its anti&s;ceptic quality.</P>
<P>The&s;e buds of plants, which are thus each an individual vegetable, in many circum|&s;tances
re&s;emble individual animals, but as animal bodies are detached from the earth,
and move from place to place in &s;earch of food, and take that food at con&s;iderable
intervals of time, and prepare it for their nouri&s;hment within their own bodies after
it is taken, it is evident they mu&s;t require many organs and powers which are not
nece&s;&s;ary to a &s;tationary bud. As vegetables are immoveably fixed to the &s;oil from
whence they draw their mouri&s;hment ready prepared, and this uniformly not at returning
intervals, it follows that in examining their anatome we are not to look for mu&s;cles of
locomotion, as arms and legs; nor for organs to receive and prepare their nouri&s;hment,
as a &s;tomach and bowels; nor for a re&s;ervoir for it after it is prepared, as a general &s;y&s;tem
of veins, which in locomotive animals contains and returns the &s;uperfluous blood
which is left after the various organs of &s;ecretion have been &s;upplied, by which con|trivance
they are enabled to live a long time without new &s;upplies of food.</P>
<P>The parts which we may expect to find in the anatome of vegetables corre&s;pondent
to tho&s;e in the animal economy are, 1. A &s;y&s;tem of ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els to imbibe the
moi&s;ture of the earth &s;imilar to the lacteal ve&s;&s;els, as in the roots of plants; and another
&s;y&s;tem of ab&s;orbents &s;imilar to the lymphatics of animal bodies, opening its mouths
on the internal cells and external &s;urfaces of vegetables; and a third &s;y&s;tem of ab|&s;orbent
ve&s;&s;els corre&s;pondent with tho&s;e of the placentation of the animal foetus. 2. A
pulmonary &s;y&s;tem corre&s;pondent to the lungs or gills of quadrupeds and fi&s;h, by
which the fluid ab&s;orbed by the lacteals and lymphatics may be expo&s;ed to the in|fluence
of the air, this is done by the green leaves of plants, tho&s;e in the air re|&s;embling
lungs, and tho&s;e in the water re&s;embling gills; and by the petals of flowers.
3. Arterial &s;y&s;tems to convey the fluid thus elaborated to the various glands of the
vegetable for the purpo&s;es of its growth, nutrition, and various &s;ecretions. 4. The
various glands which &s;eparate from the vegetable blood the honey, wax, gum, re&s;in,
&s;tarch, &s;ugar, e&s;&s;ential oil, &amp;c. 5. The organs adapted for their propagation or re|production.
6. Mu&s;cles to perform &s;everal motions of their parts.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="333">
I. The exi&s;tence of that branch of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of vegetables which re&s;embles
the lacteals of animal bodies, and imbibes their nutriment from the moi&s;t earth, is
evinced by their growth &s;o long as moi&s;ture is applied to their roots, and their quickly
withering when it is withdrawn.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e ab&s;orbents in the roots of plants there are others which open their
mouths on the external &s;urfaces of the bark and leaves, and on the internal &s;urfaces of
all the cells, and between the bark and the alburnum or &s;ap-wood; the exi&s;tence of
the&s;e is &s;hewn, becau&s;e a leaf plucked off and laid with its under &s;ide on water will not
wither &s;o &s;oon as if left in the dry air,&mdash;the &s;ame if the bark alone of a branch which
is &s;eparated from a tree be kept moi&s;t with water,&mdash;and la&s;tly, by moi&s;tening the
alburnum or &s;ap-wood alone of a branch detached from a tree it will not &s;o &s;oon wither
as if left in the dry air. By the following experiment the&s;e ve&s;&s;els were agreeably vi&s;ible
by a common magnifying gla&s;s, I placed in the &s;ummer of 1781 the foot&s;talks of &s;ome
large fig-leaves about an inch deep in a decoction of madder, (rubia tinctorum,) and
others in a decoction of logwood, (haematoxylum campechen&s;e,) along with &s;ome &s;prigs
cut off from a plant of picris, the&s;e plants were cho&s;en becau&s;e their blood is white,
after &s;ome hours, and on the next day, on taking out either of the&s;e and cutting off
from its bottom about a quarter of an inch of the &s;talk an internal circle of red points
appeared, which were the ends of ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els coloured red with the decoction,
while an external ring of arteries was &s;een to bleed out ha&s;tily a milky juice, and at once
evinced both the ab&s;orbent and arterial &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els have been called
by Grew, and Malphigi, and &s;ome other philo&s;ophers, bronchi, and erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed
to be air-ve&s;&s;els. It is probable that the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, when cut through, may effu&s;e their
fluids, and receive air, their &s;ides being too &s;tiff to collap&s;e; &s;ince dry wood emits air|bubles
in the exhau&s;ted receiver in the &s;ame manner as moi&s;t wood.</P>
<P>The &s;tructure of the&s;e vegetable ab&s;orbents con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;piral line, and not of a ve&s;&s;el
interrupted with valves like the animal lymphatics, &s;ince on breaking almo&s;t any tender
leaf and drawing out &s;ome of the fibres which adhere longe&s;t this &s;piral &s;tructure
becomes vi&s;ible even to the naked eye, and di&s;tinctly &s;o by the u&s;e of a common lens.
See Grew, Plate 51.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;tructure it is ea&s;y to conceive how a vermicular or peri&s;taltic motion of
the ve&s;&s;el beginning at the lowe&s;t part of it, each &s;piral ring &s;ucce&s;&s;ively contracting it&s;elf
till it fills up the tube, mu&s;t forcibly pu&s;h forwards its contents, as from the roots of
vines in the bleeding &s;ea&s;on; and if this vermicular motion &s;hould begin at the upper
end of the ve&s;&s;el it is as ea&s;y to &s;ee how it mu&s;t carry its contained fluid in a contrary
direction. The retrograde motion of the vegetable ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els is &s;hewn by cutting
a forked branch from a tree, and immer&s;ing a part of one of the forks in water, which
will for many days prevent the other from withering; or it is &s;hewn by planting a
willow branch with the wrong end upwards. This &s;tructure in &s;ome degree obtains in
the e&s;ophagus or throat of cows, who by &s;imilar means convey their food fir&s;t downwards
<PB N="100" REF="334">
and afterward upwards by a retrograde motion of the annular mu&s;cles or cartilages for
the purpo&s;e of a &s;econd ma&s;tication of it.</P>
<P>II. The fluids thus drank up by the vegetable ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els from the earth, or
from the atmo&s;phere, or from their own cells and inter&s;tices, are carried to the foot-&s;talk
of every leaf, where the ab&s;orbents belonging to each leaf unite into branches, forming
&s;o many pulmonary arteries, and are thence di&s;per&s;ed to the extremities of the leaf, as
may be &s;een in cutting away &s;lice after &s;lice the foot&s;talk of a hor&s;e-che&s;nut in September
before the leaf falls. There is then a compleat circulation in the leaf, a pulmonary vein
receiving the blood from the extremities of each artery on the upper &s;ide of the leaf,
and joining again in the foot&s;talk of the leaf the&s;e veins produce &s;o many arteries, or
aortas, which di&s;per&s;e the new blood over the new bark, elongating its ve&s;&s;els, or pro|ducing
its &s;ecretions; but as a re&s;ervoir of blood could not be wanted by a vegetable bud
which takes in its nutriment at all times, I imagine there is no venous &s;y&s;tem, no veins
properly &s;o called, which receive the blood which was to &s;pare, and return it into the
pulmonary or arterial &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The want of a &s;y&s;tem of veins was countenanced by the following experiment; I cut
off &s;everal &s;tems of tall &s;purge, (Euphorbia helio&s;copia) in autumn, about the centre of
the plant, and ob&s;erved tenfold the quantity of milky juice ooze from the upper than
from the lower extremity, which could hardly have happened if there had been a venous
&s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els to return the blood from the roots to the leaves.</P>
<P>Thus the vegetable circulation, complete in the lungs, but probably in the other
part of the &s;y&s;tem deficient in re&s;pect to a &s;y&s;tem of returning veins, is carried forwards
without a heart, like the circulation through the livers of animals where the blood
brought from the inte&s;tines and me&s;entery by one vein is di&s;per&s;ed through the liver by
the vena portarum, which a&s;&s;umes the office of an artery. See Note XXXVII.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time &s;o minute are the ve&s;&s;els in the intertexture of the barks of plants,
which belong to each individual bud, that a general circulation may po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t,

<P>There is however another part of the circulation of vegetable juices vi&s;ible to the
naked eye, and that is in the corol or petals of flowers, in which a part of the blood of
the plant is expo&s;ed to the influence of the air and light in the &s;ame manner as in the
foliage, as will be mentioned more at large in Notes XXXVII and XXXIX.</P>

propel the juice upwards, which they drink up from the earth, with great violence; I
&s;uppo&s;e with much greater than is exerted by the lacteals of animals, probably owing to
the greater minutene&s;s of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els in vegetables and the greater rigidity of their coats.

be produced by capillary attraction, as that could only rai&s;e a fluid nearly to the upper

to ri&s;e 21 feet above it. What then can this power be owing to? Doubtle&s;s to the living

<HEAD>NOTE XXXVII.&mdash;VEGETABLE RESPIRATION.</HEAD>
<Q><L>While &s;pread in air the leaves re&s;piring play. </L><BIBL><HI>CANTO IV.</HI> l. 421.</BIBL></Q>
<P>I. THERE have been various opinions concerning the u&s;e of the leaves of plants
in the vegetable oeconomy. Some have contended that they are per&s;piratory organs;
this does not &s;eem probable from an experiment of Dr. Hales, Veg. Stat. p. 30. He
found by cutting off branches of trees with apples on them, and taking off the leaves, that
an apple exhaled about as much as two leaves, the &s;urfaces of which were nearly equal
to the apple; whence it would appear that apples have as good a claim to be termed per|&s;piratory
organs as leaves. Others have believed them excretory organs of excremen|tious
juices; but as the vapour exhaled from vegetables has no ta&s;te, this idea is no more
probable than the other; add to this that in moi&s;t weather, they do not appear to per|&s;pire
or exhale at all.</P>
<P>The internal &s;urface of the lungs or air-ve&s;&s;els in men, are &s;aid to be equal to the ex|ternal
&s;urface of the whole body, or about fifteen &s;quare feet; on this &s;urface the blood
is expo&s;ed to the influence of the re&s;pired air through the medium however of a thin pel|licle;
by this expo&s;ure to the air it has its colour changed from deep red to bright &s;carlet,
and acquires &s;omething &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of life, that we can live &s;carcely a
minute without this wonderful proce&s;s.</P>
<P>The analogy between the leaves of plants and the lungs or gills of animals &s;eems to
embrace &s;o many circum&s;tances, that we can &s;carcely withhold our a&s;&s;ent to their per|forming
&s;imilar offices.</P>
<P>1. The great &s;urface of the leaves compared to that of the trunk and branches of trees
is &s;uch, that it would &s;eem to be an organ well adapted for the purpo&s;e of expo&s;ing the
vegetable juices to the influence of the air; this however we &s;hall &s;ee afterwards is pro|bably
performed only by their upper &s;urfaces, yet even in this ca&s;e the &s;urface of the
leaves in general bear a greater proportion to the &s;urface of the tree, than the lungs of
animals to their external &s;urfaces.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="336">
2. In the lungs of animal, the blood after having been expo&s;ed to the air in the ex|tremities
of pulmonary artery, is changed in colour from deep red to bright &s;carlet, and
certainly in &s;ome of its e&s;&s;ential properties; it is then collected by the pulmonary vein
and returned to the heart. To &s;hew a &s;imilarity of circum&s;tance in the leaves of plants
the following experiment was made, June 24, 1781: A &s;talk with leaves and &s;eed-ve&s;&s;els
of large &s;purge (Euphorbia helio&s;copia) had been &s;everal days placed in a decoction
of madder (Rubia tinctorum) &s;o that the lower part of the &s;tem, and two of the undermo&s;t
leaves were immer&s;ed in it. After having wa&s;hed the immer&s;ed leaves in clear water, I
could readily di&s;cern the colour of the madder pa&s;&s;ing along the middle rib of each leaf.
This red artery was beautifully vi&s;ible both on the under and upper &s;urface of the leaf;
but on the upper &s;ide many red branches were &s;een going from it to the extremities of
the leaf, which on the other &s;ide were not vi&s;ible except by looking through it again&s;t
the light. On this under &s;ide a &s;y&s;tem of branching ve&s;&s;els carrying a pale milky fluid
were &s;een coming from the extremities of the leaf, and covering the whole under&s;ide of
it, and joining into two large veins, one on each &s;ide of the red artery in the middle rib
of the leaf, and along with it de&s;cending to the foot&s;talk or petiole. On &s;litting one of
the&s;e leaves with &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and having a common magnifying lens ready, the milky blood
was &s;een oozing out of the returning veins on each &s;ide of the red artery in the middle
rib, but none of the red fluid from the artery.</P>
<P>All the&s;e appearances were more ea&s;ily &s;een in a leaf of Picris treated in the &s;ame
manner; for in this milky plant the &s;tems and middle rib of the leaves are &s;ometimes
naturally coloured reddi&s;h, and hence the colour of the madder &s;eemed to pa&s;s further
into the ramifications of their leaf-arteries, and was there beautifully vi&s;ible with the
returning branches of milky veins on each &s;ide.</P>
<P>3. From the&s;e experiments the upper &s;urface of the leaf appeared to be the immediate
organ of re&s;piration, becau&s;e the coloured fluid was carried to the extremities of the leaf
by ve&s;&s;els mo&s;t con&s;picuous on the upper &s;urface, and there changed into a milky fluid,
which is the blood of the plant, and then returned by concomitant veins on the under
&s;urface, which were &s;een to ooze when divided with &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and which in Picris, parti|cularly
render the under &s;urface of the leaves greatly whiter than the upper one.</P>
<P>4. As the upper &s;urface of leaves con&s;titutes the organ of re&s;piration, on which the
&s;ap is expo&s;ed in the terminations of arteries beneath a thin pellicle to the action of the
atmo&s;phere, the&s;e &s;urfaces in many plants &s;trongly repel moi&s;ture, as cabbage-leaves,
whence the particles of rain lying over their &s;urfaces without touching them, as ob&s;erved
by Mr. Melville (E&s;&s;ays Literary and Philo&s;op. Edinburgh) have the appearance of glo|bules
of quick&s;ilver. And hence leaves laid with the upper &s;urfaces on water, wither as
&s;oon as in the dry air, but continue green many days, if placed with the under &s;urfaces
on water, as appears in the experiments of Mons. Bonnet (U&s;age des Fevilles.) Hence
&s;ome aquatic plants, as the Water-lily (Nymphoea) have the lower &s;ides of their leaves
floating on the water, while the upper &s;urfaces remain dry in the air.</P>
<P>5. As tho&s;e in&s;ects, which have many &s;piracula, or breathing apertures, as wa&s;ps
and flies, are immediately &s;uffocated by pouring oil upon them, I carefully covered with
<PB N="103" REF="337">
oil the &s;urfaces of &s;everal leaves of Phlomis, of Portugal Laurel, and Bal&s;ams, and though
it would not regularly adhere, I found them all die in a day or two.</P>
<P>Of aquatic leaves, &s;ee Note on Trapa and on Fucus, in Vol. II. to which mu&s;t be added
that many leaves are furni&s;hed with mu&s;cles about their foot&s;talks, to turn their upper
&s;urfaces to the air or light, as Mimo&s;a and Hedy&s;arum gyrans. From all the&s;e analogies
I think there can be no doubt but that leaves of trees are their lungs, giving out a phlo|gi&s;tic
material to the atmo&s;phere, and ab&s;orbing oxygene or vital air.</P>
<P>6. The great u&s;e of light to vegetation would appear from this theory to be by di&s;en|gaging
vital air from the water which they per&s;pire, and thence to facilitate its union
with their blood expo&s;ed beneath the thin &s;urface of their leaves; &s;ince when pure air is
thus applied, it is probable, that it can be more readily ab&s;orbed. Hence in the curious
experiments of Dr. Prie&s;tley and Mr. Ingenhouze, &s;ome plants purified air le&s;s than
others, that is, they per&s;pired le&s;s in the &s;un&s;hine; and Mr. Scheele found that by putting
peas into water, which about half-covered them, that they converted the vital air into
fixed air, or carbonic acid gas, in the &s;ame manner as in animal re&s;piration. See Note
XXXIV.</P>
<P>7. The circulation in the lungs or leaves of plants is very &s;imilar to that of fi&s;h. In
fi&s;h the blood after having pa&s;&s;ed through their gills does not return to the heart as from
the lungs of air-breathing animals, but the pulmonary vein taking the &s;tructure of an
artery after having received the blood from the gills, which there gains a more florrid
colour, di&s;tributes it to the other parts of their bodies. The &s;ame &s;tructure occurs in the
livers of fi&s;h, whence we &s;ee in tho&s;e animals two circulations independent of the power
of the heart, viz. that beginning at the termination of the veins of the gills, and branching
through the mu&s;cles; and that which pa&s;&s;es through the liver; both which are carried
on by the action of tho&s;e re&s;pective arteries and veins. Monro's Phy&s;iology of Fi&s;h, p. 19.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e of the fluids in the roots, leaves, and buds of vegetables &s;eems to be per|formed
in a manner &s;imilar to both the&s;e. Fir&s;t the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the roots and
&s;urfaces unite at the foot&s;talk of the leaf; and then, like the Vena Portarum, an artery
commences without the intervention of a heart, and &s;preads the &s;ap in its numerous rami|fications
on the upper &s;urface of the leaf; here it changes its colour and properties, and
becomes vegetable blood; and is again collected by a pulmonary vein on the under &s;ur|face
of the leaf. This vein, like that which receives the blood from the gills of fi&s;h,
a&s;&s;umes the office and name of an artery, and branching again di&s;per&s;es the blood up|ward
to the bud from the foot&s;talk of the leaf, and downward to the roots; where it is
all expended in the various &s;ecretions, the nouri&s;hment and growth of the plant, as fa&s;t as
it is prepared.</P>
<P>II. The organ of re&s;piration already &s;poken of belongs particularly to the &s;hoots or
buds, but there is another pulmonary &s;y&s;tem, perhaps totally independent of the green
foliage, which belongs to the fructification only, I mean the corol or petals. In this
there is an artery belonging to each petal, which conveys the vegetable blood to its ex|tremities,
expo&s;ing it to the light and air under a delicate membrane covering the internal
&s;urface of the petal, where it often changes its colour, as is beautifully &s;een in &s;ome party-coloured
<PB N="104" REF="338">
poppies; though it is probable &s;ome of the iride&s;cent colours of flowers may be
owing to the different degrees of tenuity of the exterior membrane of the leaf refracting
the light like &s;oap-bubbles, the vegetable blood is then returned by corre&s;pondent vege|table
veins, exactly as in the green foliage; for the purpo&s;es of the important &s;ecretions
of honey, wax, the finer e&s;&s;ential oil, and the prolific du&s;t of the anthers.</P>
<P>1. The va&s;cular &s;tructure of the corol as above de&s;cribed, and which is vi&s;ible to the
naked eye, and its expo&s;ing the vegetable juices to the air and light during the day,
evinces that it is a pulmonary organ.</P>
<P>2. As the glands which produce the prolific du&s;t of the anthers, the honey, wax, and
frequently &s;ome odoriferous e&s;&s;ential oil, are generally attached to the corol, and always
fall off and peri&s;h with it, it is evident that the blood is elaborated or oxygenated in this
pulmonary &s;y&s;tem for the purpo&s;e of the&s;e important &s;ecretions.</P>
<P>3. Many flowers, as the Colchicum, and Hamamelis ari&s;e naked in autumn, no green
leaves appearing till the en&s;uing &s;pring; and many others put forth their flowers and
complete their impregnation early in the &s;pring before the green foliage appears, as
Mezereon, cherries, pears, which &s;hews that the&s;e corols are the lungs belonging to the
fructification.</P>
<P>4. This organ does not &s;eem to have been nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of the &s;tamens
and pi&s;tils, &s;ince the calyx of many flowers, as Tragopogon, performs this office; and in
many flowers the&s;e petals them&s;elves are &s;o tender as to require being &s;hut up in the calyx
during the night, for what other u&s;e then can &s;uch an apparatus of ve&s;&s;els be de&s;igned?</P>
<P>5. In the Helleborus-niger, Chri&s;tmas-ro&s;e, after the &s;eeds are grown to a certain &s;ize,
the nectaries and &s;tamens drop off, and the beautiful large white petals change their
colour to a deep green, and gradually thus become as calyx inclo&s;ing and defending the
ripening &s;eeds, hence it would &s;eem that the white ve&s;&s;els of the corol &s;erved the office of
expo&s;ing the blood to the action of the air, for the purpo&s;es of &s;eparating or producing
the honey, wax, and prolific du&s;t, and when the&s;e were no longer wanted, that the&s;e
ve&s;&s;els coale&s;ced like the placental ve&s;&s;els of animals after their birth, and thus cea&s;ed to
perform that office and lo&s;t at the &s;ame time their white colour. Why &s;hould they loo&s;e
their white colour, unle&s;s they at the &s;ame time lo&s;t &s;ome other property be&s;ides that of
defending the &s;eed-ve&s;&s;el, which they &s;till continue to defend?</P>
<P>6. From the&s;e ob&s;ervations I am led to doubt whether green leaves be ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to the progre&s;s of the fruit-bud after the la&s;t year's leaves are fallen off. The
green leaves &s;erve as lungs to the &s;hoots and fo&s;ter the new buds in their bo&s;oms,
whether the&s;e buds be leaf-buds or fruit-buds; but in the early &s;pring the fruit-buds
expand their corols, which are their lungs, and &s;eem no longer to require green leaves;
hence the vine bears fruit at one joint without leaves, and puts out a leaf-bud at another
joint without fruit. And I &s;uppo&s;e the green leaves which ri&s;e out of the earth in the
&s;pring from the Colchicum are for the purpo&s;e of producing the new bulb, and its pla|centa,
and not for the giving maturity to the &s;eed. When currant or goo&s;berry trees
lo&s;e their leaves by the depredation of in&s;ects the fruit continues to be formed, though
le&s;s &s;weet and le&s;s in &s;ize.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="339">
7. From the&s;e facts it appears that the flower-bud after the corol falls off, (which is its
lungs,) and the &s;tamens and nectary along with it, becomes &s;imply an uterus for the
purpo&s;e of &s;upplying the growing embryon with nouri&s;hment, together with a &s;y&s;tem
of ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els which bring the juices of the earth to the foot&s;talk of the fruit,
and which there changes into an artery for the purpo&s;e of di&s;tributing the &s;ap for the
&s;ecretion of the &s;accharine or farinaceous or ace&s;cent materials for the u&s;e of the
embryon. At the &s;ame time as all the ve&s;&s;els of the different buds of trees ino&s;culate
or communicate with each other, the fruit becomes &s;weeter and larger when the green
leaves continue on the tree, but the mature flowers them&s;elves, (the &s;ucceeding fruit
not con&s;idered) perhaps &s;uffer little injury from the green leaves being taken off, as
&s;ome flori&s;ts have ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>8. That the ve&s;&s;els of different vegetable buds ino&s;culate in various parts of their
circulation is rendered probable by the increa&s;ed growth of one bud, when others in
its vicinity are cut away; as it thus &s;eems to receive the nouri&s;hment which was before
divided among&s;t many.</P>

<Q><L>Love out their hour and leave their lives in air.</L> <BIBL><HI>CANTO IV.</HI> l. 456.</BIBL></Q>
<P>FROM the accurate experiments and ob&s;ervations of Spallanzani it appears that
in the Spartium Junceum, ru&s;h-broom, the very minute &s;eeds were di&s;cerned in the pod
at lea&s;t twenty days before the flower is in full bloom, that is twenty days before fecunda|tion.
At this time al&s;o the powder of the anthers was vi&s;ible, but glued fa&s;t to their &s;um|mits.
The &s;eeds however at this time, and for ten days after the blo&s;&s;om had fallen off,
appeared to con&s;i&s;t of a gelatinous &s;ub&s;tance. On the eleventh day after the falling of the
blo&s;&s;om the &s;eeds became heart-&s;hape, with the ba&s;is attached by an appendage to the pod,
and a white point at the apex; this white point was on pre&s;&s;ure found to be a cavity in|cluding
a drop of liquor.</P>
<P>On the 25th day the cavity which at fir&s;t appeared at the apex was much enlarged and
&s;till full of liquor, it al&s;o contained a very &s;mall &s;emi-tran&s;parent body, of a yellowi&s;h
colour, gelatinous, and fixed by its two oppo&s;ite ends to the &s;ides of the cavity.</P>
<P>In a month the &s;eed was much enlarged and its &s;hape changed from a heart to a
kidney, the little body contained in the cavity was increa&s;ed in bulk and was le&s;s
tran&s;parent, and gelatinous, but there yet appeared no organization.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="340">
On the 40th day the cavity now grown larger was quite filled with the body, which
was covered with a thin membrane; after this membrane was removed the body appeared
of a bright green, and was ea&s;ily divided by the point of a needle into two portions,
which manife&s;tly formed the two lobes, and within the&s;e attached to the lower part the
exceedingly &s;mall plantule was ea&s;ily perceived.</P>
<P>The foregoing ob&s;ervations evince, 1. That the &s;eeds exi&s;t in the ovarium many
days before fecundation. 2. That they remain for &s;ome time &s;olid, and then a cavity
containing a liquid is formed in them. 3. That after fecundation a body begins to
appear within the cavity fixed by two points to the &s;ides, which in proce&s;s of time proves
to be two lobes containing a plantule. 4. That the ripe &s;eed con&s;i&s;ts of two lobes
adhering to a plantule, and &s;urrounded by a thin membrane which is it&s;elf covered with
a hu&s;k or cuticle. Spalanzani's Di&s;&s;ertations, Vol. II. p. 253.</P>
<P>The analogy between &s;eeds and eggs has long been ob&s;erved, and is confirmed by the
mode of their production. The egg is known to be formed within the hen long before
its impregnation; C. F. Wolf a&s;&s;erts that the yolk or the egg is nouri&s;hed by the ve&s;&s;els
of the mother, and that it has from tho&s;e its arterial and venous branches, but that after
impregnation the&s;e ve&s;&s;els gradually become impervious and obliterated, and that new
ones are produced from the fetus and di&s;per&s;ed into the yolk. Haller's Phy&s;iolog.
Tom. VIII. p. 94. The young &s;eed after fecundation, I &s;uppo&s;e, is nouri&s;hed in a
&s;imilar manner from the gelatinous liquor, which is previou&s;ly depo&s;ited for that purpo&s;e;
the uterus of the plant producing or &s;ecreting it into a re&s;ervoir or amnios in which the
embryon is lodged, and that the young embryon is furni&s;hed with ve&s;&s;els to ab&s;orb a
part of it, as in the very early embryon in the animal uterus.</P>
<P>The &s;pawn of frogs and of fi&s;h is delivered from the female before its impregnation.
M. Bonnet &s;ays that the male &s;alamander darts his &s;emen into the water, where it
forms a little whiti&s;h cloud which is afterwards received by the &s;woln anus of the
female, and &s;he is fecundated.&mdash;He adds that marine plants approach near to the&s;e ani|mals,
as the male does not project a fine powder but a liquor which in like manner forms
a little cloud in the water.&mdash;And further adds, who knows but the powder of the &s;tamina
of certain plants may not make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on certain germs belonging to the ani|mal
kingdom! Letter XLIII. to Spalanzani, Oevres Philo&s;.</P>
<P>Spalanzani found that the &s;eminal fluid of frogs and dogs even when diluted with
much water retained its prolific quality. Whether this quality be &s;imply a &s;timulus
exciting the egg into animal action, which may be called a vivifying principle, or whether
part of it be actually conjoined with the egg is not yet determined, though the latter
&s;eems more probable from the frequent re&s;emblance of the fetus to the male parent. A
conjunction however of both the male and female influence &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary for the
purpo&s;e of reproduction throughout all organized nature, as well in hermaphrodite
in&s;ects, micro&s;copic animals, and polypi, and exi&s;ts as well in the formation of the
buds of vegetables as in the production of their &s;eeds, which is ingeniou&s;ly conceived
and explained by Linneus. After having compared the flower to the larva of a butterfly,
<PB N="107" REF="341">
con&s;i&s;ting of petals in&s;tead of wings, calyxes in&s;tead of wing-&s;heaths, with the organs of
reproduction, and having &s;hewn the u&s;e of the farina in fecundating the egg or &s;eed,
he proceeds to explain the production of the bud. The calyx of a flower, he &s;ays, is
an expan&s;ion of the outer bark, the petals proceed from the inner bark or rind, the
&s;tamens from the alburnum or woody circle, and the &s;tyle from the pith. In the pro|duction
and impregnation of the &s;eed a commixture of the &s;ecretions of the &s;tamens and
&s;tyle are nece&s;&s;ary; and for the production of a bud he thinks the medulla or pith bur&s;ts
its integuments and mixes with the woody part or alburnum, and the&s;e forcing their
pa&s;&s;age through the rind and bark con&s;titute the bud or viviparous progeny of the
vegetable. Sy&s;tem of Vegetables tran&s;lated from Linneus, p. 8.</P>
<P>It has been &s;uppo&s;ed that the embryon vegetable after fecundation, by its living
activity or &s;timulus exerted on the ve&s;&s;els of the parent plant, may produce the fruit or
&s;eed-lobes, as the animal fetus produces its placenta, and as vegetable buds may be
&s;uppo&s;ed to produce their umbilical ve&s;&s;els or roots down the bark of the tree. This in
re&s;pect to the production of the fruit &s;urrounding the &s;eeds of trees has been a&s;&s;imilated
to the gall-nuts on oak-leaves, and to the bedeguar on briars, but there is a powerful
objection to this doctrine, viz. that the fruit of figs, all which are female in this country,
grow nearly as large without fecundation, and therefore the embryon has in them no
&s;elf-living principle.</P>

The odoriferous e&s;&s;ential oils of &s;everal flowers &s;eem to have been de&s;igned for their

con&s;equence of the &s;ize of the particles of their blood, or of the tenuity of the exterior
membrane of the petal. The u&s;e of the prolific du&s;t is now well a&s;certained, the wax
which covers the anthers prevents this du&s;t from receiving moi&s;ture, which would make
it bur&s;t prematurely and thence prevent its application to the &s;tigma, as &s;ometimes
happens in moi&s;t years and is the cau&s;e of deficient fecundation both of our fields and
orchards.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ality of the production of honey in the vegetable world, and the very
complicated apparatus which nature has con&s;tructed in many flowers, as well as the
acrid or deleterious juices &s;he has furni&s;hed tho&s;e flowers with (as in the Aconite) to
protect this honey from rain and from the depredations of in&s;ects, &s;eem to imply that
this fluid is of very great importance in the vegetable economy; and al&s;o that it was
nece&s;&s;ary to expo&s;e it to the open air previous to its reab&s;orption into the vegetable
ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>In the animal &s;y&s;tem the lachrymal gland &s;eparates its fluid into the open air for the
purpo&s;e of moi&s;tening the eye, of this fluid the part which does not exhale is ab&s;orbed
by the puncta lachrymalia and carried into the no&s;trils; but as this is not a nutritive
fluid the analogy goes no further than its &s;ecretion into the open air and its reab&s;orption
into the &s;y&s;tem; every other &s;ecreted fluid in the animal body is in part ab&s;orbed again
into the &s;y&s;tem, even tho&s;e which are e&s;teemed excrementitious, as the urine and
per&s;pirable matter, of which the latter is &s;ecreted, like the honey, into the external air.
That the honey is a nutritious fluid, perhaps the mo&s;t &s;o of any vegetable production,
appears from its great &s;imilarity to &s;ugar, and from its affording &s;u&s;tenance to &s;uch
numbers of in&s;ects, which live upon it &s;olely during &s;ummer, and lay it up for their
winter provi&s;ion. The&s;e proofs of its nutritive nature evince the nece&s;&s;ity of its re|ab&s;orption
into the vegetable &s;y&s;tem for &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This purpo&s;e however has as yet e&s;caped the re&s;earches of philo&s;ophical botani&s;ts.
M. Pontedera believes it de&s;igned to lubricate the vegetable uterus, and compares the
horn-like nectaries of &s;ome flowers to the appendicle of the caecum inte&s;tinum of animals.
Antholog. p. 49.) Others have &s;uppo&s;ed that the honey, when reab&s;orbed, might
&s;erve the purpo&s;e of the liquor amnii, or white of the egg, as a nutriment for the young
embryon or fecundated &s;eed in its early &s;tate of exi&s;tence. But as the nectary is found
equally general in male flowers as in female ones; and as the young embryon or &s;eed
grows before the petals and nectary are expanded, and after they fall off; and, thirdly,
as the nectary &s;o &s;oon falls off after the fecundation of the pi&s;tillum; the&s;e &s;eem to be
in&s;urmountable objections to both the above-mentioned opinions.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of uncertainty conjectures may be of u&s;e &s;o far as they lead to further
experiment and inve&s;tigation. In many tribes of in&s;ects, as the &s;ilk-worm, and perhaps
in all the moths and butterflies, the male and female parents die as &s;oon as the eggs are
<PB N="109" REF="343">
impregnated and excluded; the eggs remaining to be perfected and hatched at &s;ome
future time. The &s;ame thing happens in regard to the male and female parts of flowers;
the anthers and filaments, which con&s;titute the male parts of the flower, and the &s;tigma
and &s;tyle, which con&s;titute the female part of the flower, fall off and die as &s;oon as the
&s;eeds are impregnated, and along with the&s;e the petals and nectary. Now the moths and
butterflies above-mentioned, as &s;oon as they acquire the pa&s;&s;ion and the apparatus for
the reproduction of their &s;pecies, loo&s;e the power of feeding upon leaves as they did
before, and become nouri&s;hed by what?&mdash;by honey alone.</P>
<P>Hence we acquire a &s;trong analogy for the u&s;e of the nectary or &s;ecretion of honey
in the vegetable economy, which is, that the male parts of flowers, and the female parts,
as &s;oon as they leave their fetus-&s;tate, expanding their petals, (which con&s;titute their
lungs,) become &s;en&s;ible to the pa&s;&s;ion, and gain the apparatus for the reproduction of
their &s;pecies, and are fed and nouri&s;hed with honey like the in&s;ects above de&s;cribed;
and that hence the nectary begins its office of producing honey, and dies or cea&s;es to
produce honey at the &s;ame time with the birth and death of the &s;tamens and the pi&s;tils;
which, whether exi&s;ting in the &s;ame or in different flowers, are &s;eparate and di&s;tinct
animated beings.</P>
<P>Previous to this time the anthers with their filaments, and the &s;tigmas with their
&s;tyles, are in their fetus-&s;tate &s;u&s;tained by their placental ve&s;&s;els, like the unexpanded
leaf-bud; with the &s;eeds exi&s;ting in the vegetable womb yet unimpregnated, and the
du&s;t yet unripe in the cells of the anthers. After this period they expand their petals,
which have been &s;hewn above to con&s;titute the lungs of the flower; the placental
ve&s;&s;els, which before nouri&s;hed the anthers and the &s;tigmas, coale&s;ce or cea&s;e to nouri&s;h
them; and they now acquire blood more oxygenated by the air, obtain the pa&s;&s;ion and
power of reproduction, are &s;en&s;ible to heat, and cold, and moi&s;ture, and to mechanic
&s;timulus, and become in reality in&s;ects fed with honey, &s;imilar in every re&s;pect except
their being attached to the tree on which they were produced.</P>
<P>Some experiments I have made this &s;ummer by cutting out the nectaries of &s;everal
flowers of the aconites before the petals were open, or had become much coloured, &s;ome
of the&s;e flowers near the &s;ummit of the plants produced no &s;eeds, others lower down
produced &s;eeds; but they were not &s;ufficiently guarded from the farina of the flowers in
their vicinity; nor have I had opportunity to try if the&s;e &s;eeds would vegetate.</P>
<P>I am acquainted with a philo&s;opher, who contemplating this &s;ubject thinks it not
impo&s;&s;ible, that the fir&s;t in&s;ects were the anthers or &s;tigmas of flowers; which had-by
&s;ome means loo&s;ed them&s;elves from their parent plant, like the male flowers of Valli&s;neria;
and that many other in&s;ects have gradually in long proce&s;s of time been formed
from the&s;e; &s;ome acquiring wings, others fins, and others claws, from their cea&s;ele&s;s
efforts to procure their food, or to &s;ecure them&s;elves from injury. He contends, that
none of the&s;e changes are more incomprehen&s;ible than the tran&s;formation of tadpoles
into frogs, and caterpillars into butterflies.</P>
<P>There are parts of animal bodies, which do not require oxygenated blood for the
purpo&s;e of their &s;ecretions, as the liver; which for the production of bile takes its blood
<PB N="110" REF="344">
from the me&s;enteric veins, after it mu&s;t have lo&s;t the whole or a great part of its oxyge|nation,
which it had acquired in its pa&s;&s;age through the lungs. In like manner the
pericarpium, or womb of the flower, continues to &s;ecrete its proper juices for the pre&s;ent
nouri&s;hment of the newly animated embryon-&s;eed; and the &s;accharine, ace&s;cent, or
&s;tarchy matter of the fruit or &s;eed-lobes for its future growth; in the &s;ame manner as
the&s;e things went on before fecundation; that is, without any circulation of juices in the
petals, or production of honey in the nectary; the&s;e having peri&s;hed and fallen off with
the male and female apparatus for impregnation.</P>
<P>It is probable that the depredations of in&s;ects on this nutritious fluid mu&s;t be injurious
to the products of vegetation, and would be much more &s;o, but that the plants have
either acquired means to defend their honey in part, or have learned to make more than
is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for their own economy. In the &s;ame manner the honey-dew on
trees is very injurions to them; in which di&s;ea&s;e the nutritive fluid, the vegetable-&s;ap-juice,
&s;eems to be ex&s;uded by a retrograde motion of the cutaneous lymphatics, as in
the &s;weating &s;ickne&s;s of the la&s;t century. To prevent the depredation of in&s;ects on honey
a wealthy man in Italy is &s;aid to have poi&s;oned his neighbour's bees perhaps by mixing
ar&s;nic with honey, again&s;t which there is a mo&s;t flowery declamation in Quintilian.
No. XIII. As the u&s;e of the wax is to pre&s;erve the du&s;t of the anthers from moi&s;ture,
which would prematurely bur&s;t them, the bees which collect this for the con&s;truction of
the combs or cells, mu&s;t on this account al&s;o injure the vegetation of a country where
they too much abound.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to conjecture why it was nece&s;&s;ary that this &s;ecretion of honey &s;hould be
expo&s;ed to the open air in the nectary or honey-cup, for which purpo&s;e of great an
apparatus for its defence from in&s;ects and from &s;howers became nece&s;&s;ary. This diffi|culty
increa&s;es when we recollect that the &s;ugar in the joints of gra&s;s, in the &s;ugar-cane,
and in the roots of beets, and in ripe fruits is produced without the expo&s;ure to the
air. On &s;uppo&s;ition of its &s;erving for nutriment to the anthers and &s;tigmas it may thus
acquire greater oxygenation for the purpo&s;e of producing greater powers of &s;en&s;ibility, ac|cording
to a doctrine lately advanced by a French philo&s;opher, who has endeavoured to
&s;hew that the oxygene, or ba&s;e of vital air, is the con&s;tituent principle of our power of
&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>From this provi&s;ion of honey for the male and female parts of flowers, and from
the provi&s;ion of &s;ugar, &s;tarch, oil, and mucilage, in the fruits, &s;eed-cotyledons, roots, and
buds of plants laid up for the nutriment of the expanding fetus, not only a very
numerous cla&s;s of in&s;ects, but a great part of the larger animals procure their food; and
thus enjoy life and plea&s;ure without producing pain to others, for the&s;e &s;eeds or eggs
with the nutriment laid up in them are not yet endued with &s;en&s;itive life.</P>
<P>The &s;ecretions from various vegetable glands hardened in the air produce gums,
re&s;ins, and various kinds of &s;accharine, &s;aponaceous, and wax-like &s;ub&s;tances, as the
gum of cherry or plumb-trees, gum tragacanth from the a&s;tragalus tragacantha, camphor
from the laurus camphora, elemi from amyris elemifera, aneme from hymenoea courbaril,
turpentine from pi&s;tacia terebinthus, bal&s;am of Mecca from the buds of amyris opobal|&s;amum,
<PB N="111" REF="345">
branches of which are placed in the temples of the Ea&s;t on account of their
fragrance, the wood is called xylobal&s;amum, and the fruit carpobal&s;amum; aloe from a
plant of the &s;ame name; myrrh from a plant not yet de&s;cribed; the remarkably ela&s;tic
re&s;in is brought into Europe principally in the form of fla&s;ks, which look like black leather,
and are wonderfully ela&s;tic, and not penetrable by water, rectified ether di&s;&s;olves it; its
flexibility is encrea&s;ed by warmth and de&s;troyed by cold; the tree which yields this juice
is the jatropha ela&s;tica, it grows in Guaiana and the neighbouring tracts of America;
its juice is &s;aid to re&s;emble wax in becoming &s;oft by heat, but that it acquires no ela&s;ticity
till that property is communicated to it by a &s;ecret art, after which it is poured into
moulds and well dried and can no longer be rendered fluid by heat. Mr. de la Borde
phy&s;ician at Cayenne has given this account. Manna is obtained at Naples from the
fraxinus ornus, or manna-a&s;h, it partly i&s;&s;ues &s;pontaneou&s;ly, which is preferred, and
partly ex&s;udes from wounds made purpo&s;ely in the month of Augu&s;t, many other
plants yield manna more &s;paringly; &s;ugar is properly made from the &s;accharum officinale,
or &s;ugar-cane, but is found in the roots of beet and many other plants; American wax
is obtained from the myrica cerifera, candle-berry myrtle, the berries are boiled in water
and a green wax &s;eparates, with luke warm water the wax is yellow: the &s;eed of croton
&s;ebiferum are lodged in tallow; there are many other vegetable ex&s;udations u&s;ed in the
various arts of dyeing, varni&s;hing, tanning, lacquering, and which &s;upply the &s;hop of
the druggi&s;t with medicines and with poi&s;ons.</P>
<P>There is another analogy, which would &s;eem to a&s;&s;ociate plants with animals, and
which perhaps belongs to this Note on Glandulation, I mean the &s;imilarity of their
dige&s;tive powers. In the roots of growing vegetables, as in the proce&s;s of making malt,
the farinaceous part of the &s;eed is converted into &s;ugar by the vegetable power of
dige&s;tion in the &s;ame manner as the farinaceous matter of &s;eeds are converted into &s;weet
chyle by the animal dige&s;tion. The &s;ap-juice which ri&s;es in the vernal months from the
roots of trees through the alburnum or &s;ap-wood, owes its &s;weetne&s;s I &s;uppo&s;e to a
&s;imilar dige&s;tive power of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem of the young buds. This exi&s;ts in many
vegetables in great abundance as in vines, &s;ycamore, birch, and mo&s;t abundantly in the
palm-tree, (I&s;ert's Voyage to Guinea,) and &s;eems to be a &s;imilar fluid in all plants, as
chyle is &s;imilar in all animals.</P>
<P>Hence as the dige&s;ted food of vegetables con&s;i&s;ts principally of &s;ugar, and from that
is produced again their mucilage, &s;tarch, and oil, and &s;ince animals are &s;u&s;tained by
the&s;e vegetable productions, it would &s;eem that the &s;ugar-making proce&s;s carried on in
vegetable ve&s;&s;els was the great &s;ource of life to all organized beings. And that if our
improved chemi&s;try &s;hould ever di&s;cover the art of making &s;ugar from fo&s;&s;ile or aerial
matter without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of vegetation, food for animals would then become as
plentiful as water, and mankind might live upon the earth as thick as blades of gra&s;s,
with no re&s;traint to their numbers but the want of local room.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem that roots fixed in the earth, and leaves innumerable waving in the
air were nece&s;&s;ary forthe decompo&s;ition of water, and the conver&s;ion of it into &s;accharine
<PB N="112" REF="346">
matter, which would have been not only cumberous but totally incompatible with the
locomotion of animal bodies. For how could a man or quadruped have carried on his
head or back a fore&s;t of leaves, or have had long branching lacteal or ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els
terminating in the earth? Animals therefore &s;ub&s;i&s;t on vegetables; that is, they take
the matter &s;o far prepared, and have organs to prepare it further for the purpo&s;es of
higher animation, and greater &s;en&s;ibility. In the &s;ame manner the apparatus of green
leaves and long roots were found inconvenient for the more animated and &s;en&s;itive parts
of vegetable-flowers, I mean the anthers and &s;tigmas, which are therefore &s;eparate beings,
endued with the pa&s;&s;ion and power of reproduction, with lungs of their own, and fed with
honey, a food ready prepared by the long roots and green leaves of the plant, and pre|&s;ented
to their ab&s;orbent mouths.</P>
<P>From this outline a philo&s;opher may catch a glimp&s;e of the general economy of na|ture;
and like the mariner ca&s;t upon an unknown &s;hore, who rejoiced when he &s;aw the
print of a human foot upon the &s;and, he may cry out with rapture, "A GOD DWELLS

<HEAD>The following is an Addition to the Note on Coal, No. XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>FROM this account of the production of coals from mora&s;&s;es it would appear,
that coal-beds are not to be expected beneath ma&s;&s;es of lime-&s;tone. Neverthele&s;s I have
been lately informed by my friend Mr. Michell of Thornhill, who I hope will &s;oon favour
the public with his geological inve&s;tigations, that the beds of chalk are the uppermo&s;t of
all the lime&s;tones; and that they re&s;t on the granulated lime&s;tone, called ketton-&s;tone;
which I &s;uppo&s;e is &s;imilar to that which covers the whole country from Leadenham to
Sleaford, and from Sleaford to Lincoln; and that, thirdly, coal-delphs are frequently
found beneath the&s;e two uppermo&s;t beds of lime&s;tone.</P>
<P>Now as the beds of chalk and of granulated lime&s;tone may have been formed by
alluviation, on or beneath the &s;hores of the &s;ea, or in vallies of the land; it would &s;eem,
that &s;ome coal countries, which in the great commotions of the earth had been &s;unk
beneath the water, were thus covered with alluvial lime&s;tone, as well as others with
alluvial ba&s;altes, or common gravel-beds. Very exten&s;ive plains which now con&s;i&s;t of
alluvial materials, were in the early times covered with water; which has &s;ince dimini&s;hed,
as the &s;olid parts of the earth have increa&s;ed. For the &s;olid parts of the earth con&s;i&s;ting
chiefly of animal and vegetable recrements mu&s;t have originally been formed or pro|duced
from the water by animal and vegetable proce&s;&s;es; and as the &s;olid parts of the
earth may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be thrice as heavy as water, it follows that thrice the quantity
of water mu&s;t have vani&s;hed compared with the quantity of earth thus produced. This
may account for many immen&s;e beds of alluvial materials, as gravel, rounded &s;and,
granulated lime&s;tone, and chalk, covering &s;uch exten&s;ive plains as Lincoln-heath, having
become dry without the &s;uppo&s;ition of their having been again elevated from the ocean.
At the &s;ame time we acquire the knowledge of one of the u&s;es or final cau&s;es of the
organized world, not indeed very flattering to our vanity, that it converts water into
earth, forming i&s;lands and continents by its recrements or exuviae.</P>

<P><HI>Expiring groans,</HI> p. 98. l. 451. Mr. Savery or Mr. Volney in their Travels through
Egypt has given a curious de&s;cription of one of the pyramids, with the opero&s;e method
of clo&s;ing them, and immuring the body, (as they &s;uppo&s;ed) for &s;ix thou&s;and years.
And has endeavoured from thence to &s;hew, that, when a monarch died, &s;everal of his
favourite courtiers were inclo&s;ed alive with the mummy in the&s;e great ma&s;&s;es of &s;tone-work;
and had food and water conveyed to them, as long as they lived, proper apertures
being left for this purpo&s;e, and for the admi&s;&s;ion of air, and for the exclu&s;ion of any thing offen&s;ive.</P>
<P><HI>Unfolds his larva-form.</HI> p. 197. l. 458. The flower bur&s;ts forth from its larva, the
herb, naked and perfect like a butterfly from its chry&s;olis; winged with its corol;
wing-&s;heathed by its calyx; con&s;i&s;ting alone of the organs of reproduction. The males,
or &s;tamens, have their anthers replete with a prolific powder containing the vivifying
fovilla: in the females, or pi&s;tils, exi&s;ts the ovary, terminated by the tubular &s;tigma.
When the anthers bur&s;t and &s;hed their bags of du&s;t, the male fovilla is received by the pro|lific
lymph of the &s;tigma, and produces the &s;eed or egg, which is nouri&s;hed in the ovary.

<P><HI>Wound them ye Sylphs!</HI> p. 198. 1. 463. It is cu&s;tomary to debark oak-trees in the
&s;pring, which are intended to be felled in the en&s;uing autumn; becau&s;e the bark comes
off ea&s;ier at this &s;ea&s;on, and the &s;ap-wood, or alburnum, is believed to become harder
and more durable, if the tree remains till the end of &s;ummer. The trees thus &s;tripped of
their bark put forth &s;hoots as u&s;ual with acorns on the 6th 7th and 8th joint, like vines;
but in the branches I examined, the joints of the debarked trees were much &s;horter than
tho&s;e of other oak-trees; the acorns were more numerous; and no new buds were pro|duced
above the joints which bore acorns. From hence it appears that the branches of
debarked oak-trees produce fewer leaf-buds, and more flower-buds, which la&s;t circum|&s;tance
I &s;uppo&s;e mu&s;t depend on their being &s;ooner or later debarked in the vernal
months. And, &s;econdly, that the new buds of debarked oak-trees continue to obtain
moi&s;ture from the alburnum after the &s;ea&s;on of the a&s;cent of &s;ap in other vegetables
cea&s;es; which in this unnatural &s;tate of the debarked tree may act as capillary tubes,
like the alburnum of the &s;mall debarked cylinder of a pear-tree abovementioned; or may
continue to act as placental ve&s;&s;els, as happens to the animal embryon in ca&s;es of &s;uper|fetation;
when the fetus continues a month or two in the womb beyond its u&s;ual time,
of which &s;ome in&s;tances have been recorded, the placenta continues to &s;upply perhaps
the double office both of nutrition and of re&s;piration.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="349">
<HI>With new prolific power.</HI> p. 199. l. 467. About Mid&s;ummer the new buds are
formed, but it is believed by &s;ome of the Linnean &s;chool, that the&s;e buds may in their
early &s;tate be either converted into flower-buds or leaf-buds according to the vigour of
the vegetating branch. Thus if the upper part of a branch be cut away, the buds near
the extremity of the remaining &s;tem, having a greater proportional &s;upply of nutriment,
or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a greater facility of &s;hooting their roots, or ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, down the bark,
will become leaf-buds, which might otherwi&s;e have been flower-buds. And the con|trary

<P><HI>Clo&s;ed in the &s;tyle.</HI> p. 199. l. 469. <Q><P>I conceive the medulla of a plant to con&s;i&s;t of a
bundle of nervous fibres, and that the propelling vital power &s;eparates their uppermo&s;t
extremities. The&s;e, diverging, penetrate the bark, which is now gelatinous, and become
multiplied in the new gem, or leaf-bud. The a&s;cending ve&s;&s;els of the bark being thus
divided by the nervous fibres, which perforate it, and the a&s;cent of its fluids being thus
impeded, the bark is extended into a leaf. But the flower is produced, when the pro|tru&s;ion
of the medulla is greater than the retention of the including cortical part; whence
the &s;ub&s;tance of the bark is expanded in the calyx; that of the rind, (or interior bark,)
in the corol; that of the wood in the &s;tamens, that of the medulla in the pi&s;til. Vege|tation
thus terminates in the production of new life, the ultimate medullary and cortical
fibres being collected in the &s;eeds.</P> <BIBL>Linnei Sy&s;tema Veget. p. 6. edit, 14.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><HI>Diana's trees,</HI> p. 206. l. 552. The chemi&s;ts and a&s;tronomers from the earlie&s;t antiquity
have u&s;ed the &s;ame characters to repre&s;ent the metals and the planets, which were mo&s;t
probably outlines or ab&s;tracts of the original hieroglyphic figures of Egypt. The&s;e
afterwards acquired niches in their temples, and repre&s;ented Gods as well as metals and
planets; whence &s;ilver is called Diana, or the moon, in the books of alchemy.</P>
<P>The proce&s;s for making Diana's &s;ilver tree is thus de&s;cribed by Lemeri. Di&s;&s;olve
one ounce of pure &s;ilver in acid of nitre very pure and moderately &s;trong; mix this
&s;olution with about twenty ounces of di&s;tilled water; add to this two ounces of mercury,
and let it remain at re&s;t. In about four days there will form upon the mercury a tree
of &s;ilver with branches imitating vegetation.</P>
<P>1. As the mercury has a greater affinity than &s;ilver with the nitrous acid, the &s;ilver
becomes precipitated; and, being deprived of the nitrous oxygene by the mercury, &s;inks
down in its metallic form and lu&s;tre. 2. The attraction between &s;ilver and mercury,
which cau&s;es them readily to amalgamate together, occa&s;ions the precipitated &s;ilver to
adhere to the &s;urface of the mercury in preference to any other part of the ve&s;&s;el. 3. The
attraction of the particles of the precipitated &s;ilver to each other cau&s;es the beginning
branches to thicken and elongate into trees and &s;hrubs rooted on the mercury. For
other circum&s;tances concerning this beautiful experiment &s;ee Mr. Keir's Chemical
Dictionary, art. Arbor Dianae; a work perhaps of greater utility to mankind than the
lo&s;t Alexandrian Library; the continuation of which is &s;o eagerly expected by all, who
are occupied in the arts, or attached to the &s;ciences.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE I.....METEORS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are four &s;trata of the atmo&s;phere, and four kinds of meteors. 1. Lightning
is electric, exi&s;ts in vi&s;ible clouds, its &s;hort cour&s;e, and red light. 2. Shooting &s;tars
exi&s;t in invi&s;ible vapour, without &s;ound, white light, have no luminous trains. 3. Twi-light;
fire-balls move thirty miles in a &s;econd, and are about &s;ixty miles high, have
luminous trains, occa&s;ioned by an electric &s;park pa&s;&s;ing between the aerial and inflam|mable
&s;trata of the atmo&s;phere, and mixing them and &s;etting them on fire in its pa&s;&s;age;
attracted by volcanic eruptions; one thou&s;and miles through &s;uch a medium re&s;i&s;ts le&s;s
than the tenth of an inch of gla&s;s. 4. Northern lights not attracted to a point but dif|fu&s;ed;
their colours; pa&s;&s;age of electric fire in vacuo dubious; Dr. Franklin's theory of
of northern lights countenanced in part by the &s;uppo&s;ition of a &s;uperior atmo&s;phere of
inflammable air; antiquity of their appearance; de&s;cribed in Maccabees.</P>

of &s;alt and of blue vitriol in the matter of heat. II. Other vapours may precipitate
&s;team and form rain. 1. Cold the principal cau&s;e of devaporation; hence the &s;team
di&s;&s;olved in heat is precipitated, but that di&s;&s;olved in air remains even in fro&s;ts; &s;outh-we&s;t
wind. 2. North-ea&s;t winds mixing with &s;outh-we&s;t winds produce rain; becau&s;e
the cold particles of air of the north-ea&s;t acquire &s;ome of the matter of heat from the
&s;outh-we&s;t winds. 3. Devaporation from mechanical expan&s;ion of air, as in the receiver
of an air-pump; &s;ummer-clouds appear and vani&s;h; when the barometers &s;ink without
change of wind the weather becomes colder. 4. Solution of water in electric fluid
dubious. 5. Barometer &s;inks from the le&s;&s;ened gravity of the air, and from the rain
having le&s;s pre&s;&s;ure as it falls; a mixture of a &s;olution of water in calorique with an
aerial &s;olution of water is lighter than dry air; breath of animals in cold weather why

conductor of heat; 4. by the air on mountains being mechanically rarefied as it a&s;cends;
5. gravitation of the matter of heat; 6. the da&s;hing of clouds again&s;t hills; of fogs

winds driven back. <HI>North-we&s;t winds</HI> con&s;i&s;t of &s;outh-we&s;t winds driven back; north-we&s;t
winds of America bring fro&s;t; owing to a vertical &s;piral eddy of air between the

vapour above three or four miles high at the line. <HI>Mon&s;oons and tornadoes;</HI>
&s;ome places at the tropic become warmer when the &s;un is vertical than at the line; hence
the air a&s;cends, &s;upplied on one &s;ide by the north-ea&s;t winds, and on the other by the
&s;outh-we&s;t; whence an a&s;cending eddy or tornado, rai&s;ing water from the &s;ea, or &s;and

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE general de&s;ign of the following &s;heets is to inli&s;t Imagination
under the banner of Science, and to lead her votaries from the
loo&s;er analogies, which dre&s;s out the imagery of poetry, to the
&s;tricter ones, which form the ratiocination of philo&s;ophy. While
their particular de&s;ign is to induce the ingenious to cultivate the
knowledge of BOTANY; by introducing them to the ve&s;tibule of that
delightful &s;cience, and recommending to their attention the immortal
works of the Swedi&s;h Naturali&s;t LINNEUS.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Poem, or Economy of Vegetation, the phy&s;iology of
Plants is delivered; and the operation of the Elements, as far as they
may be &s;uppo&s;ed to affect the growth of Vegetables. But the pub|lication
of this part is deferred to another year, for the purpo&s;e of
repeating &s;ome experiments on vegetation, mentioned in the notes.
In the &s;econd poem, or LOVES OF THE PLANTS, which is here pre|&s;ented
to the Reader, the Sexual Sy&s;tem of LINNEUS is explained,
with the remarkable properties of many particular plants.</P>
<P>The author has withheld this work, (excepting a few pages) many
years from the pre&s;s, according to the rule of Horace, hoping to
have rendered it more worthy the acceptance of the public,&mdash;but
finds at length, that he is le&s;s able, from di&s;u&s;e, to correct the
poetry; and, from want of leizure, to amplify the annotations.</P>
<P>In this &s;econd edition, the plants Amaryllis, Orchis, and Cannabis
are in&s;erted with two additional prints of flowers; &s;ome alterations
are made in Glorio&s;a, and Tulipa; and the de&s;cription of the Salt|mines
in Poland is removed to the fir&s;t poem on the Economy of
Vegetation.</P>

<PB REF="366">
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>LINNEUS has divided the vegetable world into 24 Cla&s;&s;es;
the&s;e Cla&s;&s;es into about 120 Orders; the&s;e Orders contain
about 2000 Families, or Genera; and the&s;e Families about 20,000
Species; be&s;ides the innumerable Varieties, which the accidents of
climate or cultivation have added to the&s;e Species.</P>
<P>The Cla&s;&s;es are di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other in this ingenious
&s;y&s;tem, by the number, &s;ituation, adhe&s;ion, or reciprocal proportion
of the males in each flower. The Orders, in many of the&s;e Cla&s;&s;es,
are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the number, or other circum&s;tances of the females.
The Families, or Genera, are characterized by the analogy of all the
parts of the flower or fructification. The Species are di&s;tingui&s;hed
by the foliage of the plant; and the Varieties by any accidental cir|cum&s;tance
of colour, ta&s;te, or odour; the &s;eeds of the&s;e do not al|ways
produce plants &s;imilar to the parent; as in our numerous fruit-trees
and garden flowers; which are propagated by grafts or layers.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t eleven Cla&s;&s;es include the plants, in who&s;e flowers both
the &s;exes re&s;ide; and in which the Males or Stamens are neither
united, nor unequal in height when at maturity; and are therefore
di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other &s;imply by the number of males in each
flower, as is &s;een in the annexed PLATE, copied from the Dictionaire
Botanique of M. BULLIARD, in which the numbers of each divi&s;ion
refer to the Botanic Cla&s;&s;es.</P>

<P><PB N="v" REF="368">
The five &s;ub&s;equent Cla&s;&s;es are di&s;tingui&s;hed not by the number

The Orders of the fir&s;t thirteen Cla&s;&s;es are founded on the number
of Females, or Pi&s;tils, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names, ONE FEMALE,
<HI>Monogynia.</HI> Two FEMALES, <HI>Digynia.</HI> THREE FEMALES, <HI>Trigynia.
&amp;c.</HI> as is &s;een in No. 1. which repre&s;ents a plant of one male, one
female; and in the fir&s;t Figure of No. xi. which repre&s;ents a flower
with twelve males, and three females; (for, where the pi&s;tils have
no apparent &s;tyles, the &s;ummits, or &s;tigmas, are to be numbered) and
in the fir&s;t Figure of No. xii. which repre&s;ents a flower with twenty
males and many females; and in the la&s;t Figure of the &s;ame No.
which has twenty males and one female; and in No. xiii. which
repre&s;ents a flower with many males and many females.</P>
<P>The Cla&s;s of Two POWERS, is divided into two natural Orders;
into &s;uch as have their &s;eeds naked at the bottom of the calyx, or
flower cup; and &s;uch as have their &s;eeds covered; as is &s;een in No.
xiv. Fig. 3. and 5.</P>
<P>The Cla&s;s of FOUR POWERS, is divided al&s;o into two Orders; in
one of the&s;e the &s;eeds are inclo&s;ed in a &s;ilicule, as in <HI>Shepherd's pur&s;e.</HI>
No. xiv. Fig. 5. In the other they are inclo&s;ed in a &s;ilique, as in
<HI>Wall-flower.</HI> Fig. 4.</P>
<P>In all the other Cla&s;&s;es, excepting the Cla&s;&s;es Confederate Males,
and Clande&s;tine Marriage, as the character of each Cla&s;s is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by the &s;ituations of the males; the character of the Orders
is marked by the numbers of them. In the Cla&s;s ONE BROTHER|HOOD,
No. xvi. Fig. 3. the Order of ten males is repre&s;ented. And
in the Cla&s;s Two BROTHERHOODS, No. xvii. Fig. 2. the Order
ten males is repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>In the Cla&s;s CONFEDERATE MALES, the Orders are chiefly dis|tingui&s;hed
by the fertility or barrenne&s;s of the florets of the di&s;k, or
ray of the compound flower.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="370">
And in the Cla&s;s of CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE, the four Orders
are termed FFRNS, MOSSES, FLAGS, and FUNGUSSES.</P>
<P>The Orders are again divided into Genera, or Families, which are
all natural a&s;&s;ociations, and are de&s;cribed from the general re&s;emblances
of the parts of fructification, in re&s;pect to their number, form, &s;itua|tion,
and reciprocal proportion. The&s;e are the Calyx, or Flower|cup,
as &s;een in No. iv. Fig. 1. No. x. Fig. 1. and 3. No. xiv. Fig.
1. 2. 3. 4. Second, the Corol, or Blo&s;&s;om, as &s;een in No. i. ii. &amp;c.
Third, the Males, or Stamens; as in No. iv. Fig. 1. and No. viii.
Fig. 1. Fourth, the Females, or Pi&s;tils; as in No. i. No. xii. Fig.
1. No. xiv. Fig. 3. No. xv. Fig. 3. Fifth, the Pericarp or Fruit|ve&s;&s;el;
as No. xv. Fig. 4. 5. No. xvii. Fig. 2. Sixth, the Seeds.</P>
<P>The illu&s;trious author of the Sexual Sy&s;tem of Botany, in his pre|face
to his account of the Natural Orders, ingeniou&s;ly imagines, that
one plant of each Natural Order was created in the beginning; and
that the intermarriages of the&s;e produced one plant of every Genus,
or Family; and that the intermarriages of the&s;e Generic, or Family
plants, produced all the Species: and la&s;tly, that the intermarriages
of the individuals of the Species produced the Varieties.</P>
<P>In the following POEM, the name or number of the Cla&s;s or
Order of each plant is printed in italics; as "<HI>Two</HI> brother &s;wains."
"<HI>One</HI> Hou&s;e contains them." and the word "<HI>&s;ecret.</HI>" expre&s;&s;es the
Cla&s;s of Clande&s;tine Marriage.</P>
<P>The Reader, who wi&s;hes to become further acquainted with this
delightful field of &s;cience, is advi&s;ed to &s;tudy the words of the Great

The males are generally united at the bottom in two &s;ets, whence Linneus has named the cla&s;s "two brotherhoods." In the Geni&s;ta, however, they are united in but one &s;et. The flowers of this cla&s;s are called papilionaccous, from their re&s;emblance to a butterfly, as the pea-blo&s;&s;om. In the Spartium Scoparium, or common broom, I have lately ob&s;erved a curious circum&s;tance, the males or &s;tamens are in two &s;ets, one &s;et ri&s;ing a quarter of an inch above the other; the upper &s;et does not arrive at their maturity &s;o &s;oon as the lower, and the &s;tigma, or head of the female, is produced among&s;t the upper or immature &s;et; but as &s;oon as the pi&s;til grows tall enough to bur&s;t open the keel-leaf, or hood of the flower, it bends it&s;elf round in an in&s;tant, like a French horn, and inserts its head, or &s;tigma, among&s;t the lower or mature &s;et of males. The pi&s;til, or female, continues to grow in length; and in a few days the &s;tigma arrives again among&s;t the upper &s;et, by the time they become mature. This wonderful contrivance is readily &s;een by opening the keel-leaf of the flowers of broom before they bur&s;t &s;pontaneou&s;ly. See note on Collin&s;onia, Glorio&s;a, Draba.</P></NOTE></L>

The males, or anthers, touch each other. The uncommon beauty of this flower occa&s;ioned Linneus to give it a name &s;ignifying the twelve heathen gods; and Dr. Mead to affix his own name to it. The pi&s;til is much longer than the &s;tamens, hence the flower-&s;talks have their elegant bend, that the &s;tigma may hang downwards to receive the fecundating du&s;t of the anthers. And the petals are &s;o beautifully turned back to prevent the rain or dew drops from &s;liding down and wa&s;hing off this du&s;t prematurely; and at the &s;ame time expo&s;ing it to the light and air. As &s;oon as the &s;eeds are &s;ormed, it erects all the flower- &s;talks to prevent them from &s;alling out; and thus loses the beauty of its figure. Is this a mechanical effect, or does it indicate a vegetable &s;torg&eacute; to pre&s;erve its offspring? See note on Ilex, and Glorio&s;a.</P>
<P>In the Meadia, the Borago, Cyclamen, Solanum, and many others, the filaments are very &s;hort compared with the &s;tyle. Hence it became nece&s;&s;ary, 1&s;t, to furni&s;h the &s;tamens with long anthers. 2d. I'o lengthen and bend the peduncle or flower-&s;talk, that the flower might hang downwards. 3d.

We may rea&s;on upon this by ob&s;erving, that all this apparatus might have been &s;pared, if the filaments alone had grown longer; and that thence in the&s;e flowers that the filaments are the most unchangeable parts; and that thence their comparative length, in re&s;pect to the &s;tyle, would afford a mo&s;t permanent mark of their generic character.</P></NOTE></L>

One male and one female inhabit this flower; but there are be&s;ides four imperfect males, or filaments without anthers upon them, called by Lin|neus eunuchs. The flax of our country has ten filaments, and but five of them are ter|minated with anthers; the Portugal flax has ten perfect males, or females; the Verbena of our country has four males; that of Sweden has but two; the genus Albuca, the Bignonia Catalpa, Gratiola, and hemlock-leaved Geranium have only half their filaments crowned with anthers. In like manner the florets, which form the rays of the flowers of the order fru&s;traneous polygamy of the cla&s;s &s;yngene&s;ia, or confederate males, as the &s;un|flower, are furni&s;hed with a &s;tyle only, and no &s;tigma: and are thence barren.

<P>There is a curious circum&s;tance belonging to the cla&s;s of in&s;ects which have two wings, or diptera, analogous to the rudiments of &s;tamens above de&s;cribed; viz. two little knobs are found placed each on a &s;talk or peduncle, generally under a little arched &s;cale; which appear to be rudiments of hinder wings; and are called by Linneus, halteres, or poi&s;ers, a term of his introduction.

<L>The fell SILENE and her &s;i&s;ters fair,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Silene.</HI> l. 139. Catchfly. Three females and ten males inhabit each flower; the vi&s;cous material, which &s;urrounds the &s;talks under the flowers of this plant, and of the Cucubulus Otites, is a curious contrivance to prevent various in&s;ects from plundering the honey, or devouring the &s;eed. In the Dionaea Mu&s;cipula there is a &s;till more won|derful contrivance to prevent the depredations of in&s;ects: The leaves are armed with long teeth, like the antennae of in&s;ects, and lie &s;pread upon the ground round the &s;tem; and are &s;o irritable, that when an in&s;ect creeps upon them, they fold up, and cru&s;h or pierce it to death. The la&s;t profe&s;&s;or Linneus, in his Supplementum Plantarum, gives the fol|lowing account of the Arum Mu&s;civorum. The flower has the &s;mell of carrion; by which the flies are invited to lay their eggs in the chamber of the flower, but in vain en|deavour to e&s;cape, being prevented by the hairs pointing inwards; and thus peri&s;h in the flower, whence its name of fly-eater. P. 411. in the Dyp&s;acus is another contrivance for this purpo&s;e, a ba&s;on of water is placed round each joint of the &s;tem. In the Dro&s;era is another kind of fly-trap. See Dyp&s;acus and Dro&s;era; the flowers of Sil&eacute;ne and Cuc&uacute;|balus are clo&s;ed all day, but are open and give an agreeable odour in the night. See Cerea.

Some of the bell-flowers clo&s;e their apertures at night, or in rainy or cold weather, as the convolvulus, and thus protect their included &s;tamens and pi&s;tils. Other bell-flowers hang their apertures downwards, as many of the lilies; in tho&s;e the pi&s;til, when at maturity, is longer than the &s;tamens; and by this pendant attitude of the bell, when the anthers bur&s;t, their du&s;t falls on the &s;tigma; and the&s;e are at the &s;ame time &s;heltered as with an umbrella from rain and dews. But, as a free expo&s;ure to the air is nece&s;&s;ary for their fecundation, the &s;tyle and filaments in many of the&s;e flowers continue to grow longer after the bell is open, and hang down below its rim. In others, as in the mar|tagon, the bell is deeply divided, and the divi&s;ions are reflected upwards, that they may not prevent the acce&s;s of air, and at the &s;ame time afford &s;ome &s;helter from perpendicular rain or dew. Other bell-flowers, as the hemerocallis and amaryllis, have their bells nodding only, as it were, or hanging obliquely toward the horizon; which, as their &s;tems are &s;lender, turn like a weathercock from the wind; and thus very effectually pre&s;erve their inclo&s;ed &s;tamens and anthers from the rain and cold. Many of the&s;e flowers, both before and after their &s;ea&s;on of fecundation, erect their heads perpen|dicular to the horizon, like the Meadia, which cannot be explained from meer mechani&s;m.</P>
<P>The Amaryllis formo&s;i&s;&s;ima is a flower of the la&s;t mentioned kind, and affords an agreeable example of <HI>art</HI> in the vegetable economy. 1.

The &s;hrubs and trees, which have prickles or thorns, are grateful food to many animals, as goo&s;berry, and gor&s;e; and would be quickly devoured, if not thus armed; the &s;tings &s;eem a protection again&s;t &s;ome kinds of in&s;ects, as well as the naked mouths of quadrupeds. Many plants lo&s;e their thorns by cultivation, as wild animals lo&s;e their ferocity; and &s;ome of them their horns. A curi|ous circum&s;tance attends the large hollies in Needwood-fore&s;t, they are armed with thorny leaves about eight feet high, and have &s;mooth leaves above; as if they were con|&s;cious that hor&s;es and cattle could not reach their upper branches.

<L>Fair LONICERA prints the dewy lawn,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Lonicera.</HI> l. 243. Caprifolium. Honey&s;uckle. Five males, one female. Nature has in many flowers u&s;ed a wonderful apparatus to guard the nectary, or honey-gland, from infects. In the honey-&s;uckle the petal terminates in a long tube like a cornucopiae, or horn of plenty; and the honey is produced at the bottom of it. In Aconitum, monks|hood, the nectaries &s;tand upright like two horns covered with a hood, which abounds with &s;uch acrid matter that no infects penetrate it. In Helleborus, hellebore, the many nectaries are placed in a circle, like little pitchers, and add much to the beauty of the flower. In the Columbine, Aquilegia, the nectary is imagined to be like the neck and body of a bird, and the two petals &s;tanding upon each &s;ide to repre&s;ent wings; whence its name of columbine, as if re&s;embling a ne&s;t of young pigeons fluttering whil&s;t their parent feeds them. The importance of the nectary in the economy of vegetation is ex|plained at large in the note on part the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Many infects are provided with a long and pliant probo&s;cis for the purpo&s;e of acquiring this grateful food, as a variety of bees, moths, and butterflies: but the Sphinx Con|volvuli, or unicorn moth, is furni&s;hed with the mo&s;t remarkable probo&s;cis in this climate. It carries it rolled up in concentric circles under its chin, and occa&s;ionally extends it to above three inches in length. This trunk con&s;i&s;ts of joints and mu&s;cles, and &s;eems to have more ver&s;atile movements than the trunk of the elephant; and near its termination is &s;plit into two capillary tubes. The excellence of this contrivance for robbing the flowers of their honey, keeps this beautiful in&s;ect fat and bulky; though it flies only in the evening, when the flowers have clo&s;ed their petals, and are thence more difficult of acce&s;s; at the &s;ame time the brilliant colours of the moth contribute to its &s;afety, by making it mi&s;taken by the late &s;leeping birds for the flower it re&s;ts on.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e there is a curious contrivance attending the Ophrys, commonly called the Bee-orchis, and the Fly-orchis, with &s;ome kinds of the Delphinium, called Bee|lark&s;purs, to pre&s;erve their honey; in the&s;e the nectary and petals re&s;emble in form and colour the in&s;ects, which plunder them: and thus it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, they often e&s;cape the&s;e hourly robbers, by having the appearance of being pre-occupied.

Thus the flowers of the male Val|li&s;neria are produced under water, and when ripe detach them&s;elves from the plant, and ri&s;ing to the &s;urface are wafted by the air to the female flowers.

<P>This curious &s;tem is &s;ometimes pu&s;hed out of the ground in its horizontal &s;ituation by &s;ome of the inferior branches of the root, &s;o as to give it &s;ome re&s;emblance to a Lamb &s;tanding on four legs; and has been &s;aid to de&s;troy all other plants in its vicinity.

<P>The thick downy clothing of &s;ome vegetables &s;eems de&s;igned to protect them from the injuries of cold, like the wool of animals. Tho&s;e bodies, which are bad conductors of electricity, are al&s;o bad conductors of heat, as gla&s;s, wax, air. Hence either of the two former of the&s;e may be melted by the flame of a blow-pipe very near the fingers which hold it without burning them; and the la&s;t, by being confined on the &s;urface of animal bodies, in the inter&s;tices of their fur or wool, prevents the e&s;cape of their natural warmth; to which &s;hould be added, that the hairs them&s;elves are imperfect conductors. The fat or oil of whales, and other northern animals, &s;eems de&s;igned for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e of preventing the too &s;udden e&s;cape of the heat of the body in cold climates. Snow protects vegetables which are covered by it from cold, both becau&s;e it is a bad conductor of heat it&s;elf, and contains much air in its pores.

Animals fed with madder for the purpo&s;e of the&s;e experiments were found upon di&s;&s;ection to have thinner gall. Comment. de rebus. Lip&s;iae. This circum&s;tance is worth further attention. The colouring materials of vege|tables, like tho&s;e which &s;erve the purpo&s;e of tanning, varni&s;hing, and the various medi|cal purpo&s;es, do not &s;eem e&s;&s;ential to the life of the plant; but &s;eem given it as a defence again&s;t the depredations of in&s;ects or other animals, to whom the&s;e materials are nau&s;eous or deleterious. To in&s;ects and many &s;maller animals their colours contribute to conceal them from the larger ones which prey upon them. Caterpillars which feed on leaves are generally green; and earth-worms the colour of the earth which they inhabit; Butter|flies, which frequent flowers, are coloured like them; &s;mall birds which frequent hedges have greeni&s;h backs like the leaves, and light coloured bellies like the &s;ky, and are hence le&s;s vi&s;ible to the hawk, who pa&s;&s;es under them or over them. Tho&s;e birds which are much among&s;t flowers, as the gold-finch (Fringilla carduelis), are furni&s;hed with vivid colours. The lark, partridge, hare, are the colour of the dry vegetables or earth on which they re&s;t. And frogs vary their colour with the mud of the &s;treams which they frequent; and tho&s;e which live on trees are green. Fi&s;h, which are generally &s;u&s;pended in water, and &s;wallows, which are generally &s;u&s;pended in air, have their backs the co|lour of the di&s;tant ground, and their bellies of the &s;ky. In the colder climates many of the&s;e become white during the exi&s;tence of the &s;nows.

<L>Her buoyant &s;kiff intrepid ULVA guides,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Ulva.</HI> l. 407. Clande&s;tine marriage. This kind of &s;ea-weed is buoyed up by bladders of air, which are formed in the duplicatures of its leaves; and forms immen&s;e float|ing fields of vegetation; the young ones, branching out from the larger ones, and borne on &s;imilar little air-ve&s;&s;els. It is al&s;o found in the warm baths of Patavia; where the leaves are formed into curious cells or labyrinths for the purpo&s;e of floating on the water. See ulva labyrinthi-formis Lin. Spec. Plant. The air contained in the&s;e cells was found by Dr. Prie&s;tley to be &s;ometimes purer than common air, and &s;ometimes le&s;s pure; the air-bladders of fi&s;h &s;eem to be &s;imilar organs, and &s;erve to render them buoyant in the water. In &s;ome of the&s;e, as in the Cod and Haddock, a red membrane, con&s;i&s;ting of a great number of leaves or duplicatures, is &s;ound within the air-bag, which probably &s;ecretes this air from the blood of the animal. (Monro. Phy&s;iol. of Fi&s;h. p. 28.) To determine whether this air, when fir&s;t &s;eparated from the blood of the animal or plant, be dephlogi&s;ticated air, is worthy inquiry. The bladder-&s;ena (Colutea), and bladder-nut (Staphylaea), have their &s;eed-ve&s;&s;els di&s;tended with air; the Ketmia has the upper joint of the &s;tem immediately under the receptacle of the flower much di&s;tended with air; the&s;e &s;eem to be analogous to the air-ve&s;&s;el at the broad end of the egg, and may probably become le&s;s pure as the &s;eed ripens: &s;ome, which I tried, had the purity of the &s;urround|ing atmo&s;phere. The air at the broad end of the egg is probably an organ &s;erving the purpo&s;e-of re&s;piration to the young chick, &s;ome of who&s;e ve&s;&s;els are &s;pread upon it like a placenta, or permeate it. Many are of opinion that even the placenta of the human &s;etus, and cotyledons of quadropeds, are re&s;piratory organs rather than nutritious ones.</P>
<P>The air in the hollow &s;tems of gra&s;&s;es, and of &s;ome umbelli&s;erous plants, bears analogy to the air in the quills, and in &s;ome of the bones of birds; &s;upplying the place of the pith, which shrivels up after it has performed its office of protruding the young &s;tem or feather. Some of the&s;e cavities of the bones are &s;aid to communicate with the lungs in birds. Phil. Tran&s;.</P>
<P>The air-bladders of fi&s;h are nicely adapted to their intended purpo&s;e; for though they render them buoyant near the &s;urface without the labour of u&s;ing their fins, yet, when they re&s;t at greater depths, they are no inconvenience, as the increa&s;ed pre&s;&s;ure of the water conden&s;es the air which they contain into le&s;s &s;pace. Thus, if a cork or bladder of air was immer&s;ed a very great depth in the ocean, it would be &s;o much compre&s;&s;ed, as to become &s;pecially as heavy as the water, and would remain there. It is probable the unfortunate Mr. Day, who was drowned in a diving-&s;hip of his own con&s;truction, milcarried from not attending to this circum&s;tance; it is probable the quantity of air he took down with him, if he de&s;cended much lower than he expected, was conden&s;ed into &s;o &s;mall a &s;pace as not to render the &s;hip buoyant when he endeavoured to a&s;cend.</P></NOTE></L>

<P>Not &s;o; for &s;ublime &s;entiments are often better expre&s;&s;ed in

left wounded on the field after the lo&s;s of the battle, and his friend
&s;ays to him, "Oh, could you but fly!" what can be more &s;ublime
than his an&s;wer, "Why then, I would not fly." No mea&s;ure of
ver&s;e, I imagine, could add dignity to this &s;entiment. And it would

<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Next to the mea&s;ure of the language, the principal di&s;tinction
appears to me to con&s;i&s;t in this: that Poetry admits of but few words
expre&s;&s;ive of very ab&s;tracted ideas, whereas Pro&s;e abounds with
them. And as our ideas derived from vi&s;ible objects are more dis|tinct
than tho&s;e derived from the objects of our other &s;en&s;e, the
words expre&s;&s;ive of the&s;e ideas belonging to vi&s;ion make up the
principal part of poetic language. That is, the Poet writes princi|pally

The word renown'd does not pre&s;ent the idea of a vi&s;ible object to
the mind, and is thence pro&s;aic. But change this line thus,
<Q>And Kennet &s;wift, where &s;ilver Graylings <HI>play.</HI></Q>

<P>In poetry the per&s;onification or allegoric figure is generally
indi&s;tinct, and therefore does not &s;trike us &s;o forcibly as to make us
attend to its improbability; but in painting, the figures being all
<PB N="52" REF="433">
much more di&s;tinct, their improbability becomes apparent, and &s;eizes
our attention to it. Thus the per&s;on of Concealment is very indis|tinct,
and therefore does not compel us to attend to its improbability,
in the following beautiful lines of Shake&s;pear:
<Q><L>&mdash;She never told her love;</L>
<L>But let Concealment, like a worm i' th' bud,</L>
<L>Feed on her dama&s;k cheek.&mdash;</L></Q>
But in the&s;e lines below the per&s;on of Rea&s;on obtrudes it&s;elf into our
company, and becomes di&s;agreeable by its di&s;tinctne&s;s, and cones|quent
improbability.</P>

<P>Allegoric figures are on this account in general le&s;s manageable
in painting and in &s;tatuary than in poetry: and can &s;eldom be intro|duced
in the two former arts in company with natural figures, as is
evident from the ridiculous effect of many of the paintings of Rubens
in the Luxemburgh gallery; and for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e their im|probability

Mrs. Angelica Kauffman, well appri&s;ed of this circum&s;tance, has
introduced no mortal figures among&s;t her Cupids and her Graces. And
the great Roubiliac, in his unrivalled monument of Time and Fame
&s;truggling for the trophy of General Fleming, has only hung up a
medallion of the head of the hero of the piece. There are however
&s;ome allegoric figures, which we have &s;o often heard de&s;cribed or
&s;een delineated, that we almo&s;t forget that they do not exi&s;t in
common life; and hence view them without a&s;toni&s;hment; as the
figures of the heathen mythology, of angels, devils, death and time;
and almo&s;t believe them to be realities, even when they are mixed
with repre&s;entations of the natural forms of man. Whence I con|clude,
that a certain degree of probability is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent us
from revolting with di&s;ta&s;te from unnatural images; unle&s;s we are

<P>Is this rea&s;oning about degrees of probability ju&s;t?&mdash;When Sir
Jo&s;hua Reynolds, who is unequalled both in the theory and practice
of his art, and who is a great ma&s;ter of the pen as well as the pencil,
has a&s;&s;erted in a di&s;cour&s;e delivered to the Royal Academy, December
11, 1786, that <Q>the higher &s;tyles of painting, like the higher kinds
of the Drama, do not aim at any thing like deception; or have
any expectation, that the &s;pectators &s;hould think the events there
repre&s;ented are really pa&s;&s;ing before them.</Q> And he then accu&s;es
Mr. Fielding of bad judgment, when he attempts to compliment
Mr. Garrick in one of his novels, by introducing an ignorant man,
mi&s;taking the repre&s;entation of a &s;cene in Hamlet for a reality; and
<PB N="54" REF="435">
thinks, becau&s;e he was an ignorant man, he was le&s;s liable to make
&s;uch a mi&s;take.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a metaphy&s;ical que&s;tion, and requires more attention than
Sir Jo&s;hua has be&s;towed upon it.&mdash;You will allow, that we are per|fectly
deceived in our dreams; and that even in our waking reveries,
we are often &s;o much ab&s;orbed in the contemplation of what pa&s;&s;es
in our imaginations, that for a while we do not attend to the lap&s;e
of time or to our own locality; and thus &s;uffer a &s;imilar kind of de|ception
as in our dreams. That is, we believe things pre&s;ent before
our eyes, which are not &s;o.</P>
<P>There are two circum&s;tances, which contribute to this compleat
deception in our dreams. Fir&s;t, becau&s;e in &s;leep the organs of &s;en&s;e
are clo&s;ed or inert, and hence the trains of ideas a&s;&s;ociated in our
imaginations are never interrupted or di&s;&s;erered by the irritations of
external objects, and can not therefore be contra&s;ted with our &s;en|&s;ations.
On this account, though we are affected with a variety of
pa&s;&s;ions in our dreams, as anger, love, joy; yet we never experience
&s;urprize.&mdash;For &s;urprize is only produced when any external irrita|tions
&s;uddenly obtrude them&s;elves, and di&s;&s;ever our pa&s;&s;ing trains of
ideas.</P>
<P>Secondly, becau&s;e in &s;leep there is a total &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of our volun|tary
power, both over the mu&s;cles of our bodies, and the ideas of our
minds; for we neither walk about, nor rea&s;on in compleat &s;leep.
Hence, as the trains of ideas are pa&s;&s;ing in our imaginations in dreams,
we cannot compare them with our previous knowledge of things, as
we do in our waking hours; for this is a voluntary exertion; and
thus we cannot perceive their incongruity.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="436">
Thus we are deprived in &s;leep of the only two means by which we
can di&s;tingui&s;h the trains of ideas pa&s;&s;ing in our imaginations, from
tho&s;e excited by our &s;en&s;ations; and are led by their vivacity to be|lieve
them to belong to the latter. For the vivacity of the&s;e trains
of ideas, pa&s;&s;ing in the imagination, is greatly increa&s;ed by the cau&s;es
above-mentioned; that is, by their not being di&s;turbed or di&s;&s;evered
either by the appul&s;es of external bodies, as in &s;urprize; or by our
voluntary exertions in comparing them with our previous knowledge
of things, as in rea&s;oning upon them.</P>

<P>Now to apply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>When by the art of the Painter or Poet a train of ideas is &s;ug|ge&s;ted
to our imaginations, which intere&s;ts us &s;o much by the pain
or plea&s;ure it affords, that we cea&s;e to attend to the irritations of
common external objects, and cea&s;e al&s;o to u&s;e any voluntary efforts
to compare the&s;e intere&s;ting trains of ideas with our previous know|ledge
of things, a compleat reverie is produced: during which time,
however &s;hort, if it be but for a moment, the objects them&s;elves
appear to exi&s;t before us. This, I think, has been called by an in|genious
critic "the ideal pre&s;ence" of &s;uch objects. (Elements of
Critici&s;m by Lord Kaimes). And in re&s;pect to the compliment in|tended
by Mr. Fielding to Mr. Garrick, it would &s;eem that an ig|norant
Ru&s;tic at the play of Hamlet, who has &s;ome previous belief
in the appearance of Gho&s;ts, would &s;ooner be liable to fall into re|verie,
and continue in it longer, than one who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more know|ledge

the&s;e di&s;tinctly before the eye, &s;o as to produce (as above-mentioned)
the ideal pre&s;ence of the object, in which the great Shake&s;pear par|ticularly
excells.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it is not of any con&s;equence whether the repre&s;entations
corre&s;pond with nature?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not if they &s;o much intere&s;t the reader or &s;pectator as to in|duce
the reverie above de&s;cribed. Nature may be &s;een in the market|place,
or at the card-table; but we expect &s;omething more than this
in the play-hou&s;e or picture-room. The further the arti&s;ts recedes
from nature, the greater novelty he is likely to produce; if he ri&s;es
above nature, he produces the &s;ublime; and beauty is probably a
&s;election and new combination of her mo&s;t agreeable parts. Your|&s;elf
will be &s;en&s;ible of the truth of this doctrine by recollecting over
<PB N="57" REF="438">
in your mind the works of three of our celebrated arti&s;ts. Sir Jo&s;hua
Reynolds has introduced &s;ublimity even into its protraits; we admire
the repre&s;entation of per&s;ons, who&s;e reality we &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed
by unnoticed. Mrs. Angelica Kauffman attracts our eyes with
beauty, which I &s;uppo&s;e no where exi&s;ts; certainly few Grecian faces
are &s;een in this country. And the daring pencil of Fu&s;eli tran&s;ports
us beyond the boundaries of nature, and ravi&s;hes us with the charm
of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting novelty. And Shake&s;pear, who excells in all
the&s;e together, &s;o far captivates the &s;pectator, as to make him un|mindful
of every kind of violation of Time, Place, or Exi&s;tence.
As at the fir&s;t appearance of the Gho&s;t of Hamlet, <Q>his ear mu&s;t
be dull as the fat weed, which roots it&s;elf on Lethe's brink,</Q> who
can attend to the improbality of the exhibition. So in many &s;cenes
of the Tempe&s;t we perpetually believe the action pa&s;&s;ing before our
eyes, and relap&s;e with &s;omewhat of di&s;ta&s;te into common life at the
intervals of the repre&s;entation.</P>

On the river Derwent near Matlock in Derby&s;hire, Sir RICHARD ARKWRIGHT has erected his curious and magnificent machinery for &s;pinning cotton; which had been in vain attempted by many ingenious arti&s;ts before him. The cotton-wool is fir&s;t picked from the pods and &s;eeds by women. It is then c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">rded by <HI>cylindrical cards</HI> which move again&s;t each other, with different ve|locities.

After the di&s;covery of letters, the facts of A&s;tronomy and Chemi&s;try became recorded in written language, though the antient hieroglyphic characters for the planets and metals continue in u&s;e at this day.

<P>THE mon&s;ters of your Botanic Garden are as &s;ur|pri&s;ing
as the bulls with brazen feet, and the fire-breathing
dragons, which guarded the He&s;perian fruit; yet are they
not di&s;gu&s;ting, nor mi&s;chievous: and in the manner you have
chained them together in your exhibition, they &s;ucceed each other
amu&s;ingly enough, like prints of the London Cries, wrapped upon
rollers, with a gla&s;s before them. In this at lea&s;t they re&s;emble the
mon&s;ters in Ovid's Metamorpho&s;es; but your &s;imilies, I &s;uppo&s;e,
are Homeric?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>The great Bard well under&s;tood how to make u&s;e of this
kind of ornament in Epic Poetry. He brings his valiant heroes
into the field with much parade, and &s;ets them a fighting with great
fury; and then, after a few thru&s;ts and parries, he introduces a long
&s;tring of &s;imilies. During this the battle is &s;uppo&s;ed to continue;
and thus the time nece&s;&s;ary for the action is gained in our imagina|tions;
<PB N="93" REF="474">
and a degree of probability produced, which contributes to
the temporary deception or reverie of the reader.</P>
<P>But the &s;imilies of Homer have another agreeable characteri&s;tic;
they do not quadrate, or go upon all fours (as it is called), like the
more formal &s;imilies of &s;ome modern writers; any one re&s;embling
feature &s;eems to be with him a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for the introduction
of this kind of digre&s;&s;ion; he then proceeds to deliver &s;ome agree|able
poetry on this new &s;ubject, and thus converts every &s;imile into
a kind of &s;hort epi&s;ode.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then a &s;imile &s;hould not very accurately re&s;emble the &s;ubject?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; it would then become a philo&s;ophical analogy, it would
be ratiocination in&s;tead of poetry: it need only &s;o far re&s;emble the
&s;ubject, as poetry it&s;elf ought to re&s;emble nature. It &s;hould have
&s;o much &s;ublimity, beauty, or novelty, as to intere&s;t the reader;
and &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed in picture&s;que language, &s;o as to bring the
&s;cenery before his eye; and &s;hould la&s;tly bear &s;o much veri-&s;imili|tude
as not to awaken him by the violence of improbability or in|congruity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>May not the reverie of the reader be di&s;&s;ipated or di&s;turbed

<PB N="94" REF="475">
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly; he will endeavour to rou&s;e him&s;elf from a di&s;agree|able
reverie, as from the night-mare. And from this may be dis|covered
the line of boundary between the Tragic and the Horrid:
which line, however, will veer a little this way or that, according to
the prevailing manners of the age or country, and the peculiar a&s;&s;o|ciations
of ideas, or idio&s;yncracy of mind, of individuals. For in|&s;tance,
if an arti&s;t &s;hould repre&s;ent the death of an officer in battle,
by &s;hewing a little blood on the bo&s;om of his &s;hirt, as if a bullet
had there penetrated, the dying figure would affect the beholder
with pity; and if fortitude was at the &s;ame time expre&s;&s;ed in his
countenance, admiration would be added to our pity. On the con|trary,
if the arti&s;t &s;hould chu&s;e to repre&s;ent his thigh as &s;hot away
by a cannon ball, and &s;hould exhibit the bleeding fle&s;h and &s;hattered

from a butcher's &s;hop, or a &s;urgeon's operation-room, and we &s;hould

<P>The Painters have been more guilty in this re&s;pect than the
Poets; the cruelty of Apollo in flaying Marcias alive is a favourite

have di&s;graced the modern ones. It requires little genius to
exhibit the mu&s;cles in convul&s;ive action either by the pencil or
the chiffel, becau&s;e the inter&s;tices are deep, and the lines &s;trongly
defined: but tho&s;e tender gradations of mu&s;cular action, which
con&s;titute the graceful attitudes of the body, are difficult to con|ceive
or to execute, except by a ma&s;ter of nice di&s;cernment and
cultivated ta&s;te.</P>

<P>We mu&s;t not confound our &s;en&s;ations at the contemplation of
real mi&s;ery with tho&s;e which we experience at the &s;cenical repre|&s;entations
of tragedy. The &s;pectators of a &s;hipwreck may be at|tracted
by the dignity and novelty of the object; and from the&s;e
may be &s;aid to receive plea&s;ure; but not from the di&s;tre&s;s of the &s;uf|ferers.
An ingenious writer, who has critici&s;ed this dialogue in the
Engli&s;h Review for Augu&s;t, 1789, adds, that one great &s;ource of our
plea&s;ure from &s;cenical di&s;tre&s;s ari&s;es from our, at the &s;ame time,
generally contemplating one of the noble&s;t objects of nature, that

of Virtue triumphant over every difficulty and oppre&s;&s;ion, or &s;upport|ing
its votary under every &s;uffering: or, where this does not occur,
that our minds are relieved by the ju&s;tice of &s;ome &s;ignal puni&s;hment
awaiting the delinquent. But, be&s;ides this, at the exhibition of a good
tragedy, we are not only amu&s;ed by the dignity, and novelty, and
beauty, of the objects before us; but, if any di&s;tre&s;&s;ful circum&s;tances
occur too forcible for our &s;en&s;ibility, we can voluntarily exert our|&s;elves,
and recollect, that the &s;cenery is not real: and thus not only
the pain, which we had received from the apparent di&s;tre&s;s, is
le&s;&s;ened, but a new &s;ource of plea&s;ure is opened to us, &s;imilar to that
which we frequently have felt on awaking from a di&s;tre&s;&s;ful
dream; we are glad that it is not true. We are at the &s;ame time
unwilling to relinqui&s;h the plea&s;ure which we receive from the other
intere&s;ting circum&s;tances of the drama; and on that account quickly
permit our&s;elves to relap&s;e into the delu&s;ion; and thus alternately
believe and di&s;believe, almo&s;t every moment, the exi&s;tence of the
objects repre&s;ented before us.</P>

The &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies or hi&s;ories belonging to &s;ome vegetables have been truly ridiculous; thus the Druids are &s;aid to have cropped the Mi&s;letoe with a golden axe or &s;ickle; and the Bryony, or Mandrake, was &s;aid to utter a &s;cream when its root was drawn from the ground; and that the ani|mal which drew it up became di&s;ea&s;ed and &s;oon died: on which account, when it was wanted for the purpo&s;es of medicine, it was u&s;ual to loo&s;en and remove the earth about the root, and then to tie it by means of a cord to a dog's tail, who was whipped to pull it up, and was then &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;uffer for the impiety of the action.

But, at the &s;ame time, many of our mu&s;cular motions, and many of our ideas, continue to be excited into action in con&s;equence of internal irritations and of internal &s;en&s;a|tions; for the heart and arteries continue to beat, and we experience variety of pa&s;&s;ions, and even hunger and thir&s;t in our dreams. Hence I conclude, that our nerves of &s;en&s;e are not torpid or inert during &s;leep; but that they are only precluded from the perception of external objects, by their external organs being rendered unfit to tran&s;mit to them the appu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">es of external bodies, during the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the power of volition; thus the eye-lids are clo&s;ed in &s;leep, and I &s;uppo&s;e the tympanum of the ear is not &s;tretched, becau&s;e they are deprived of the voluntary exertions of the mu&s;cles appropriated to the&s;e pur|po&s;es; and it is probable &s;omething &s;imilar happens to the external apparatus of our other organs of &s;en&s;e, which may render them unfit for their office of perception during &s;leep: for milk put into the mouths of &s;leeping babes occa&s;ions them to &s;wallow and &s;uck; and, if the eye-lid is a little opened in the day-light by the exertions of di&s;turbed &s;leep, the per&s;on dreams of being much dazzled.

<P>The odours of many flowers, &s;o delightful to our &s;en&s;e of &s;mell, as well as the dis|greeable &s;cents of others, are owing to the exhalation of their e&s;&s;ential oils. The&s;e e&s;&s;ential oils have greater or le&s;s volatility, and are all inflammable; many of them are poi&s;ons to us, as the&s;e of Laurel and Tobacco; others po&s;&s;e&s;s a narcotic quality, as is evinced by the oil of cloves in&s;tantly relieving &s;light tooth-achs; from oil of cinnamon relieving the h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ccup; and bal&s;am of peru relieving the pain of &s;ome ulcers. They are all deleterious to certain in&s;ects, and hence their u&s;e in the vegetable economy being produced in flowers or leaves to protect them from the depredations of their voracious enemies. One of the e&s;&s;ential oils, that of turpentine, is recommended, by M. de Thoffe, for the purpo&s;e of de&s;troying in&s;ects which infect both vegetables and animals. Having ob&s;erved that the trees were attacked by multitudes of &s;mall in&s;ects of different colours (pucins ou purrons), which injured their young branches, he de&s;troyed them all intinaely in the following manner: he put into a bowl a few handfuls of earth, on which he poured a &s;mall quantity of oil of turpentine; he then beat the whole toge|ther with a &s;patula, p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">uring on it water till it became of the con&s;i&s;tence of &s;oup; with this mixture he moi&s;tened the ends of the branches, and both the in&s;ects and their eggs were de&s;troyed, and other in&s;ects kept aloof by the &s;cent of the turpentine. He adds, that he de&s;troyed the fleas of his puppies by once bathing them in warm water impreg|nated with oil of turpentine. Mem. d'Agriculture, An. 1787, Trime&s;t. Printemp. p. 109.

<L>With blu&s;hes bright as morn fair ORCHIS charms,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Orchis.</HI> l. 259. The Orchis morio in the circum&s;tance of the parent-root &s;hrivelling up and dying, as the young one increa&s;es, is not only analogous to other tuberous or knobby roots, but al&s;o to &s;ome bulbous roots, as the tulip. The manner of the pro|duction of herbaceous plants from their various perennial roots, &s;eems to want further inve&s;tigation, as their analogy is not yet clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed. The caudex, or true root, in the orchis lies above the knob; and from this part the fibrous roots and the new knob are produced. In the tulip the caudex lies below the bulb; from whence proceed the fibrous roots and the new bulbs; and I &s;u&s;pect the tulip-root, after it has flowered, dies like the orchis-root; for the &s;tem of the la&s;t year's tulip lies on the out&s;ide, and not in the center of the new bulb; which I am informed does not happen in the three or four fir&s;t years when rai&s;ed from feed, when it only produces a &s;tem, and &s;lender leaves without flowering. In the tulip-root, di&s;&s;ected in the early &s;pring, ju&s;t before it begins to &s;hoot, a perfect flower is &s;een in its center; and between the fir&s;t and &s;econd coat the large next year's bulb is, I believe, produced; between the &s;econd and third coat, and between this and the fourth coat, and perhaps further, other le&s;s and le&s;s bulls are vi&s;ible, all adjoining to the caudex at the bottom of the mother-bulb; and which, I am told, require as many years before they will flower, as the number of the coats with which they are covered. This annual reproduction of the tulip-root induces &s;ome flori&s;ts to believe that tulip-roots never die naturally, as they lo&s;e &s;o few of them; whereas the hyacinth-roots, I am informed, will not la&s;t above five or &s;even years after they have flowered.</P>
<P>The hyacinth-root differs from the tulip-root, as the &s;tem of the la&s;t year's flower is always found in the center of the root, and the new off-&s;ets ari&s;e from the caudex below the bulb, but not beneath any of the concentric coats of the root, except the external one: hence Mr. Eaton, an ingenious flori&s;t of Derby, to whom I am indebted for mo&s;t of the ob&s;ervations in this note, concludes, that the hyacinth-root does not peri&s;h an|nually after it has flowered like the tulip. Mr. Eaton gave me a tulip root which had been &s;et too deep in the earth, and the caudex had elongated it&s;elf near an inch, and the new bulb was formed above the old one, and detached from it, in&s;tead of adher|ing to its &s;ide.</P>
<P>The caudex of the ranunculus, cultivated by the flori&s;ts, lies above the claw-like root; in this the old root or claws die annually, like the tulip and orchis, and the new claws, which are &s;een above the old ones, draw down the caudex lower into the earth. The &s;ame is &s;aid to happen to Scabio&s;a, or Devil's bit, and &s;ome other plants, as vale|rian and greater plantain; the new fibrous roots ri&s;ing round the caudex above the old ones, the inferior end of the root becomes &s;tumped, as if cut off, after the old fibrous are decayed, and the caudex is drawn down into the earth by the&s;e new roots. See Arum and Tulipa.</P></NOTE></L>

And as the &s;ea-&s;alt &s;eems to have its origin from the de&s;truction of vegetable and animal bodies, wa&s;hed down by rains, and carried by rivers into lakes or &s;eas; it would &s;eem that this &s;ource of &s;ea-&s;alt had not &s;o long exi&s;ted in that country. There is, however, a more &s;atisfactory way of explaining this circum&s;tance; which is, that the American lakes lie above the level of the ocean, and are hence perpetually de&s;alited by the rivers which run through them; which is not the ca&s;e with the Mediterranean, into which a current from the main ocean perpetually pa&s;&s;es.</P></NOTE></L>

(Amaen. Acad. 149.) among&s;t these emigrant &s;eeds. The fact is truly wonderful, and cannot be accounted for but by the exi&s;tence of under currents in the depths of the ocean; or from vortexes of water pa&s;&s;ing from one country to another through caverns of the earth.</P>
<P>Sir Hans Sloane has given an account of four kinds of &s;eeds, which are frequently thrown by the &s;ea upon the coa&s;ts of the i&s;lands of the northern parts of Scotland. Phil. Tran&s;. abridged, Vol. III. p. 540. which &s;eeds are natives of the West Indies, and &s;eem to be brought thither by the gulf-&s;tream de&s;erbed below. One of the&s;e is called, by Sir H. Sloane, Pha&s;eolus maximus perennis, which is often al&s;o thrown on the coa&s;t of Kerry in Ireland; another is called, in Jamaica, Hor&s;e-eye-bean; and a third is called Niker in Jamaica. He adds, that the Lenticula marina, or Sargo&s;&s;o, grows on the rocks about Jamaica, is carried by the winds and current towards the coa&s;t of Florida, and thence into the North-American ocean, where it lies very thick on the &s;urface of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Thus a rapid current pa&s;&s;es from the gulf of Florida to the N. E. along the coa&s;t of North-America, known to &s;eamen by the name of the GULF-STREAM. A chart of this was publi&s;hed by Dr. Francklin in 1768, from the information principally of Capt. Folger. This was confirmed by the ingenious experiments of Dr. Blagden, published in 1781, who found that the water of the Gulf-&s;tream was from &s;ix to eleven degrees warmer than the water of the &s;ea through which it ran; which mu&s;t have been occa|&s;ioned by its being brought from a hotter climate. He a&s;cribes the origin of this current to the power of the trade-winds, which, blowing always in the &s;ame direction, carry the waters of the Atlantic ocean to the we&s;tward, till they are &s;topped by the oppo&s;ing con|tinent on the we&s;t of the Gulf of Mexico, and are thus accumulated there, and run down the Gulf of Florida. Philo&s;. Tran&s;. V. 71, p. 335. Governor Pownal has given an elegant map of this Gulf-&s;tream, tracing it from the Gulf of Florida north|ward as &s;ar as Cape Sable in Nova Scotia, and then acro&s;s the Atlantic ocean to the coa&s;t of Africa between the Canary-i&s;lands and Senegal, increasing in breadth&punc; as it runs, till it occupies five or &s;ix degrees of latitude. The Governer likewi&s;e a&s;cribes this current to the force of the trade-winds <HI>protruding</HI> the waters we&s;tward, till they are oppo&s;ed by the continent, and accumulated in the Gulf of Mexico. He very ingeni|ou&s;ly ob&s;erves, that a great eddy mu&s;t be produced in the Atlantic ocean between this Gulf-stream and the we&s;terly current protruded by the tropical winds, and in this eddy are found the immen&s;e fields of floating vegetables, called Sarago&s;a weeds, and Gulf|weeds, and &s;ome light woods, which circulate in the&s;e va&s;t eddies, or are occa&s;ionally driven out of them by the winds. Hydraulic and Nautical Ob&s;ervations by Governor Pownal, 1787. Other currents are mentioned by the Governor in this ingeniou work, as tho&s;e in the Indian Sea, northward of the line, which are a&s;cribed to the influence of the Mon&s;oons. It is probable, that in proce&s;s of time the narrow tract of land on the we&s;t of the Gulf of Mexico may be worn away by this elevation of water da&s;hing again&s;t it, by which this immen&s;e current would cea&s;e to exi&s;t, and a wonderful change take place in the Gulf of Mexico and We&s;t Indian i&s;lands, by the &s;ub&s;iding of the &s;ea, which might probably lay all tho&s;e i&s;lands into one, or join them to the continent.</P></NOTE></L>

<P>POETRY has been called a &s;i&s;ter-art both to Painting and to Mu&s;ic; I wi&s;h to know, what are the
particulars of their relation&s;hip?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has been already ob&s;erved, that the principal part of the
language of poetry con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e words, which are expre&s;&s;ive of
the ideas, which we originally receive by the organ of &s;ight; and
in this it nearly indeed re&s;embles painting; which can expre&s;s it&s;elf
in no other way, but by exciting the ideas or &s;en&s;ations belonging
to the &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion. But be&s;ides this e&s;&s;ential &s;imilitude in the
language of the poetic pen and pencil, the&s;e two &s;i&s;ters re&s;emble
each other, if I may &s;o &s;ay, in many of their habits and manners.
The painter, to produce a &s;trong effect, makes a few parts of his
picture large, di&s;tinct, and luminous, and keeps the remainder in
&s;hadow, or even beneath its natural &s;ize and colour, to give emi|nence
to the principal figure. This is &s;imilar to the common
<PB N="134" REF="515">
manner of poetic compo&s;ition, where the &s;ubordinate characters are
kept down, to elevate and give con&s;equence to the hero or heroine
of the piece.</P>
<P>In the &s;outh aile of the cathedral church at Lichfield, there is an
antient monument of a recumbent figure; the head and neck of
which lie on a roll of matting in a kind of niche or cavern in the
wall; and about five feet di&s;tant horizontally in another opening or
cavern in the wall are &s;een the feet and ankles, with &s;ome folds of
garment, lying al&s;o on a matt; and though the intermediate &s;pace is
a &s;olid &s;tone-wall, yet the imagination &s;upplies the deficiency, and
the whole figure &s;eems to exi&s;t before our eyes. Does not this re|&s;emble
one of the arts both of the painter and the poet? The former
often &s;hows a mulcular arm amid&s;t a group of figures, or an im|pa&s;&s;ioned
face; and, hiding the remainder of the body behind other
objects, leaves the imagination to compleat it. The latter, de&s;cribing
a &s;ingle feature or attitude in picture&s;que words, produces before the
mind an image of the whole.</P>
<P>I remember &s;eeing a print, in which was repre&s;ented a &s;hrivelled
hand &s;tretched through an iron grate, in the &s;tone floor of a pri&s;on|yard,
to reach at a me&s;s of porrage, which affected me with more
horrid ideas of the di&s;tre&s;s of the pri&s;oner in the dungeon below,
than could have been perhaps produced by an exhibition of the
whole per&s;on. And in the following beautiful &s;cenery from the
Mid&s;ummer-night's dream, (in which I have taken the liberty to
alter the place of a comma), the de&s;cription of the &s;wimming &s;tep and
prominent belly bring the whole figure before our eyes with the
di&s;tinctne&s;s of reality.</P>
<Q><L>When we have laugh'd to &s;ee the &s;ails conceive,</L>
<L>And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;</L>
<PB N="135" REF="516">
<L>Which &s;he with pretty and with &s;wimming gate,</L>
<L>Following her womb, (then rich with my young &s;quire),</L>
<L>Would imitate, and &s;ail upon the land.</L></Q>
<P>There is a third &s;i&s;ter-feature, which belongs both to the pictorial
and poetic art; and that is the making &s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions vi&s;ible,
as it were, to the &s;pectator; this is done in both arts by de&s;cribing
or portraying the effects or changes which tho&s;e &s;entiments or
pa&s;&s;ions produce upon the body. At the end of the unaltered play
of Lear, there is a beautiful example of poetic painting; the old
King is introduced as dying from grief for the lo&s;s of Cordelia;
at this cri&s;is, Shake&s;pear, conceiving the robe of the king to be held
together by a cla&s;p, repre&s;ents him as only &s;aying to an attendant
courtier in a faint voice, "Pray, Sir, undo this button,&mdash;thank you,
Sir," and dies. Thus by the art of the poet, the oppre&s;&s;ion at the
bo&s;om of the dying King is made vi&s;ible, not de&s;cribed in words.</P>

<P>What are the features, in which the&s;e Si&s;ter-arts do not re|&s;emble
each other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>The ingenious Bi&s;hop Berkeley, in his Treati&s;e on Vi&s;ion, a
work of great ability, has evinced, that the colours, which we &s;ee,
are only a language &s;ugge&s;ting to our minds the ideas of &s;olidity and
exten&s;ion, which we had before received by the &s;en&s;e of touch.
Thus when we view the trunk of a tree, our eye can only acquaint
us with the colours or &s;hades; and from the previous experience of
the &s;en&s;e of touch, the&s;e &s;ugge&s;t to us the cylindrical form, with the
prominent or depre&s;&s;ed wrinkles on it. From hence it appears, that
<PB N="136" REF="517">
there is the &s;tricte&s;t analogy between colours and &s;ounds; as they
are both but languages, which do not repre&s;ent their corre&s;pondent
ideas, but only &s;ugge&s;t them to the mind from the habits or a&s;&s;oci|ations
of previous experience. It is therefore rea&s;onable to conclude,
that the more artificial arrangements of the&s;e two languages by the
poet and the painter bear a &s;imilar analogy.</P>
<P>But in one circum&s;tance the Pen and the Pencil differ widely from
each other, and that is the quantity of Time which they can in|clude
in their re&s;pective repre&s;entations. The former can unravel a
long &s;eries of events, which may con&s;titute the hi&s;tory of days or
years; while the latter can exhibit only the actions of a moment.
The Poet is happier in de&s;cribing &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;cenes; the Painter in
repre&s;enting &s;tationary ones: both have their advantages.</P>
<P>Where the pa&s;&s;ions are introduced, as the Poet, on one hand, has
the power gradually to prepare the mind of his reader by previous
climacteric circumstances; the Painter, on the other hand, can throw
&s;tronger illumination and di&s;tinctne&s;s on the principal moment or
catastrophe of the action; be&s;ides the advantage he has in u&s;ing an
univer&s;al language, which can be <HI>read</HI> in an in&s;tant of time. Thus
where a great number of figures are all &s;een together, &s;upporting or
contra&s;ting each other, and contributing to explain or aggrandize
the principal effect, we view a picture with agreeable &s;urprize, and
contemplate it with uncea&s;ing admiration. In the repre&s;entation of
the &s;acrifice of Jephtha's Daughter, a print done from a painting of
Ant. Coypel, at one glance of the eye we read all the intere&s;ting
pa&s;&s;ages of the la&s;t act of a well-written tragedy; &s;o much poetry is
there conden&s;ed into a moment of time.</P>

<P>Will you now oblige me with an account of the relation&s;hip
between Poetry, and her other &s;i&s;ter, Mu&s;ic?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="137" REF="518">
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the poetry of our language I don't think we are to look for
any thing analogous to the notes of the gamut; for, except perhaps
in a few exclamations or interrogations, we are at liberty to rai&s;e
or &s;ink our voice an octave or two at plea&s;ure, without altering the
&s;en&s;e of the words. Hence, if either poetry or pro&s;e be read in me|lodious
tones of voice, as is done in recitativo, or in chaunting, it
mu&s;t depend on the &s;peaker, not on the writer: for though words
may be &s;elected which are le&s;s har&s;h than others, that is, which
have fewer &s;udden &s;tops or abrupt con&s;onants among&s;t the vowels,
or with fewer &s;ibilant letters, yet this does not con&s;titute melody,
which con&s;i&s;ts of agreeable &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of notes referrable to the
gamut; or harmony, which con&s;i&s;ts of agreeable combinations of
them. If the Chine&s;e language has many words of &s;imilar articula|tion,
which yet signify different ideas, when &s;poken in a higher or
lower mu&s;ical note, as &s;ome travellers affirm, it mu&s;t be capable of
much finer effect, in re&s;pect to the audible part of poetry, than any
language we are acquainted with.</P>
<P>There is however another affinity, in which poetry and mu&s;ic
more nearly re&s;emble each other than has generally been under&s;tood,
and that is in their mea&s;ure or time. There are but two kinds
of time acknowledged in modern mu&s;ic, which are called <HI>triple
time,</HI> and <HI>common time.</HI> The former of the&s;e is divided by bars,
each bar containing three crotchets, or a proportional number of
their &s;ubdivi&s;ions into quavers and &s;emiquavers. This kind of time
is analogous to the mea&s;ure of our heroic or iambic ver&s;e. Thus the
two following couplets are each of them divided into five bars
of <HI>triple time,</HI> each bar con&s;i&s;ting of two crotchets and two quavers;
nor can they be divided into bars analogous to <HI>common time</HI> without
the bars interfering with &s;ome of the crotchets, &s;o as to divide them.</P>
<Q><L>3/4 Soft-warbling beaks &verbar; in each bright blo&s; &verbar; &s;om move,</L>
<L>And vo &verbar; cal ro&s;ebuds thrill &verbar; the inchanted grove, &verbar;</L></Q>
<P><PB N="138" REF="519">
In the&s;e lines there is a quaver and a crochet alternately in every
bar, except in the la&s;t, in which <HI>the in</HI> make two &s;emiquavers; the <HI>e</HI>
is &s;uppo&s;ed by Grammarians to be cut off, which any one's ear will
readily determine not to be true.</P>
<Q><L>3/4 Life buds or breathes &verbar; from Indus to &verbar; the poles,</L>
<L>And the &verbar; va&s;t &s;urface kind &verbar; les, as it rolls. &verbar;</L></Q>
<P>In the&s;e lines there is a quaver and a crotchet alternately in the
&s;ir&s;t bar; a quaver, two crotchets, and a quaver, make the &s;econd bar.
In the third bar there is a quaver, a crotchet, and a re&s;t after the
crotchet, that is, after the word <HI>poles,</HI> and two quavers begin the
next line. The fourth bar con&s;i&s;ts of quavers and crotchets alter|nately.
In the la&s;t bar there is a quaver, and a re&s;t after it, viz.
after the word <HI>kindles;</HI> and then two quavers and a crotchet. You
will clearly perceive the truth of this, if you prick the mu&s;ical cha|racters
above mentioned under the ver&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>common time</HI> of mu&s;icians is divided into bars, each of which
contains four crotchets, or a proportional number of their &s;ubdivi&s;ion
into quavers and &s;emiquavers. This kind of mu&s;ical time is analo|gous
to the dactyle ver&s;es of our language, the mo&s;t popular in&s;tances
of which are in Mr. An&s;tie's Bath-Guide. In this kind of ver&s;e the
bar does not begin till after the fir&s;t or &s;econd &s;yllable; and where
the ver&s;e is quite complete, and written by a good ear, the&s;e fir&s;t &s;yl|lables
added to the la&s;t complete the bar, exactly in this al&s;o corre|&s;ponding
with many pieces of mu&s;ic;
<Q><L>2/4 Yet &verbar; if one may gue&s;s by the &verbar; &s;ize of his calf, Sir,</L>

<P><PB N="139" REF="520">
In the&s;e lines each bar con&s;i&s;ts of a crotchet, two quavers, another
crotchet, and two more quavers: which are equal to four crotchets,
and, like many bars of <HI>common time</HI> in mu&s;ic, may be &s;ubdivided into
two in beating time without di&s;turbing the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The following ver&s;es from Shen&s;tone belong likewi&s;e to common
time:
<Q><L>2/4 A &verbar; river or a &s;ea &verbar;</L>
<L>Was to him a di&s;h &verbar; of tea,</L>
<L>And a king &verbar; dom bread and butter.</L></Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t and &s;econd bars con&s;i&s;t each of a crotchet, a quaver, a
crotchet, a quaver, a crotchet. The third bar con&s;i&s;ts of a quaver,
two crotchets, a quaver, a crotchet. The la&s;t bar is not complete
without adding the letter A, which begins the fir&s;t line, and then it
con&s;i&s;ts of a quaver, a crotchet, a quaver, a crotchet, two quavers.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the crotchets in triple time are in general
played by mu&s;icians slower than tho&s;e of common time, and hence
minuets are generally pricked in triple time, and country dances ge|nerally
in common time. So the ver&s;es above related, which are
analogous to <HI>triple time,</HI> are generally read &s;lower than tho&s;e analo|gous
to <HI>common time;</HI> and are thence generally u&s;ed for graver com|po&s;itions.
I &s;uppo&s;e all the different kinds of ver&s;es to be found in
our odes, which have any mea&s;ure at all, might be arranged <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word">
one or other of the&s;e two mu&s;ical times; allowing a note or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word">
&s;ometimes to precede the commencement of the bar, and occa&s;ional
re&s;ts, as in mu&s;ical compo&s;itions: if this was attended to by tho&s;e
who &s;et poetry to mu&s;ic, it is probable the &s;ound and &s;en&s;e would
oftener coincide. Whether the&s;e mu&s;ical times can be applied to the
lyric and heroic ver&s;es of the Greek and Latin poets, I do not pre|tend
to determine; certain it is, that the dactyle ver&s;e of our lan|guage,
when it is ended with a double rhime, much re&s;embles the
mea&s;ure of Homer and Virgil, except in the length of the lines.</P>

Sir I&s;aac Newton has ob&s;erved, that the breadths of the &s;even primary

the &s;even mu&s;ical notes of the gamut, or to the intervals of the eight
&s;ounds contained in an octave, that is, proportional to the following

<P>Newton's Optics, Book I, part 2. prop. 3 and 6. Dr. Smith, in his
Harmonics, has an explanatory note upon this happy di&s;covery, as he
terms it, of Newton. Sect. 4. Art. 7.</P>
<P>From this curious coincidence, it has been propo&s;ed to produce a
luminous mu&s;ic, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ucce&s;&s;ions or combinations of colours,
analogous to a tune in respect to the proportions above mentioned.
This might be performed by a &s;trong light, made by means of Mr.
Argand's lamps, pa&s;&s;ing through coloured gla&s;&s;es, and falling on
a defined part of a wall, with moveable blinds before them, which
might communicate with the keys of a harp&s;ichord; and thus pro|duce
at the &s;ame time vi&s;ible and audible mu&s;ic in uni&s;on with each
other.</P>
<P>The execution of this idea is &s;aid by Mr. Guyot to have been at|tempted
by Father Caffel without much &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="522">
If this &s;hould be again attempted, there is another curious coinci|dence
between &s;ounds and colours, di&s;covered by Dr. Darwin of
Shrew&s;bury, and explained in a paper on what he calls <HI>Ocular Spectra,</HI>
in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, Vol. LXXVI. which might much
facilitate the execution of it. In this treati&s;e the Doctor has demon|&s;trated,
that we &s;ee certain colours, not only with greater ea&s;e and
di&s;tinctne&s;s, but with relief and plea&s;ure, after having for &s;ome time
contemplated other certain colours; as green after red, or red after
green; orange after blue, or blue after orange; yellow after violet,
or violet after yellow. This he &s;hews ari&s;es from the <HI>ocular &s;pectrum</HI>
of the colour la&s;t viewed coinciding with the <HI>irritation</HI> of the colour
now under contemplation. Now as the plea&s;ure we receive from
the &s;en&s;ation of melodious notes, independent of the previous a&s;&s;o|ciations
of agreeable ideas with them, mu&s;t ari&s;e from our hearing
&s;ome proportions of &s;ounds after others more ea&s;ily, di&s;tinctly, or
agreeably; and as there is a coincidence between the proportions of
the primary colours, and the primary &s;ounds, if they may be &s;o
called; he argues, that the &s;ame laws mu&s;t govern the &s;en&s;ations of
both. In this circum&s;tance, therefore, con&s;i&s;ts the &s;i&s;terhood of Mu&s;ic
and Painting; and hence they claim a right to borrow metaphors
from each other; mu&s;icians to &s;peak of the brilliancy of &s;ounds,
and the light and &s;hade of a concerto; and painters of the harmony
of colours, and the tone of a picture. Thus it was not quite &s;o ab|&s;urd,
as was imagined, when the blind man a&s;ked if the colour
&s;carlet was like the &s;ound of a trumpet. As the coincidence or op|po&s;ition
of the&s;e <HI>ocular &s;pectra,</HI> (or colours which remain in the eye
after having for &s;ome time contemplated a luminous object) are
more ea&s;ily and more accurately a&s;certained, now their laws have
been inve&s;tigated by Dr. Darwin, than the <HI>relicts</HI> of evane&s;cent &s;ounds
upon the ear; it is to be wi&s;hed that &s;ome ingenious mu&s;ician would
further cultivate this curious field of &s;cience: for if visible mu&s;ic
can be agreeably produced, it would be more ea&s;y to add &s;entiment
to it by the repre&s;entations of groves and Cupids, and &s;leeping
<PB N="142" REF="523">
nymphs amid the changing colours, than is commonly done by the
words of audible mu&s;ic.</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mentioned the greater length of the ver&s;es of Homer and
Virgil. Had not the&s;e poets great advantage in the &s;uperiority of
their languages compared to our own?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is probable, that the introduction of philo&s;ophy into a
country mu&s;t gradually affect the language of it; as philo&s;ophy con|ver&s;es
in more appropriated and ab&s;tracted terms; and thus by de|grees
eradicates the abundance of metaphor, which is u&s;ed in the
more early ages of &s;ociety. Otherwi&s;e, though the Greek compound
words have more vowels in proportion to their con&s;onants than the
Engli&s;h ones, yet the modes of compounding them are le&s;s general;
as may be &s;een by variety of in&s;tances given in the preface of the
Tran&s;lators, prefixed to the SYSTEM OF VEGETABLES by the Lich|field
Society; which happy property of our own language rendered
that tran&s;lation of Linneus as expre&s;&s;ive and as conci&s;e, perhaps more
&s;o than the original.</P>
<P>And in one re&s;pect, I believe, the Engi&s;h language &s;erves the pur|po&s;e
of poetry better than the antient ones, I mean in the greater
ea&s;e of producing per&s;onifications; for as our nouns have in general
no genders affixed to them in pro&s;e-compo&s;itions, and in the habits
of conver&s;ation, they become ea&s;ily per&s;onified only by the addition
of a ma&s;culine or feminine pronoun, as,
<Q><L>Pale Melancholy &s;its, and round <HI>her</HI> throws</L>
<L>A death-like &s;ilence, and a dread repo&s;e.</L>
<BIBL>Pope's Abelard.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="524">
And &s;econdly, as mo&s;t of our nouns have the article <HI>a</HI> or <HI>the</HI> prefixed
to them in pro&s;e-writing and in conver&s;ation, they in general become
per&s;oni&s;ied even by the omi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e articles; as in the bold
figure of Shipwreck in Mi&s;s Seward's Elegy on Capt. Cook:
<Q><L>But round the &s;teepy rocks and dangerous &s;trand</L>
<L>Rolls the white &s;urf, and SHIPWRECK guards the land.</L></Q></P>
<P>Add to this, that if the ver&s;es in our heroic poetry be &s;horter than
tho&s;e of the ancients, our words likewi&s;e are &s;horter; and in re&s;pect
to their mea&s;ure or time, which has erroneou&s;ly been called melody
and harmony, I doubt, from what has been &s;aid above, whether we
are &s;o much inferior as is generally believed;&s;ince many pa&s;&s;ages,
which have been &s;tolen from antient poets, have been tran&s;lated into
our language without lo&s;ing any thing of the beauty of the ver|&s;ification.</P>

<P>It may be difficult to mark the exact boundary of what &s;hould

&s;ingle words, on the contrary, taken from other authors, cannot con|vict
a writer of plagiari&s;m; they are lawful game, wild by nature,
the property of all who can capture them;&mdash;and perhaps a few
common flowers of &s;peech may be gathered, as we pa&s;s over our

neighbour's inclo&s;ure, without &s;tigmatizing us with the title of
thieves; but we mu&s;t not therefore plunder his cultivated fruit.</P>
<P>The four lines at the end of the plant Upas are imitated from Dr.
Young's Night Thoughts. The line in the epi&s;ode adjoined to Ca&s;&s;ia,
"The &s;alt tear mingling with the milk he &s;ips," is from an intere&s;t|ing
and humane pa&s;&s;age in Langhorne's Ju&s;tice of Peace. There are

<L>Refulgent CEREA!&mdash;at the du&s;ky hour<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Cerea.</HI> l. 15. Cactus grandi&s;lorus, or Cercus. Twenty males, one female. This flower is a native of Jamaica and Veracrux. It expands a most exqui&s;itely beautiful corol, and emits a mo&s;t fragrant odour for a few hours in the night, and then clo&s;es to open no more. The flower is nearly a foot in diameter; the in&s;ide of the calyx of a &s;plendid yellow, and the numerous petals of a pure white: it begins to open about &s;even or eight o'clock in the evening, and cl&s;o&s;es before &s;un-ri&s;e in the morning. Martyn's Letters, p. 294. The Ci&s;tus labdiniferus, and many other flowers, lo&s;e their petals after having been a few hours expanded in the day-time; for in the&s;e plants the &s;tigma is &s;oon impregnated by the numerous anthers: in many flowers of the Ci&s;tus lubdiniferus I ob|&s;erved two or three of the &s;tamens were perpetually bent into contact with the pi&s;til.</P>
<P>The Nyctanthes, called Arabian Ja&s;mine, is another flower, which expands a beau|tiful corol, and gives out a mo&s;t delicate perfume during the night, and not in the day, in its native country, whence its name; botanical philo&s;ophers have not yet explained this wonderful property; perhaps the plant &s;leeps during the day as &s;ome animals do; and its odoriferous glands only emit their fragrance during the expan&s;ion of the petals; that is, during its waking hours: the Geranium tri&s;le has the &s;ame property of giving up its fragrance only in the night. The flowers of the Cucurbita lagenaria are &s;aid to clo&s;e when the &s;un &s;hines upon them. In our climate many flowers, as tragopogon, and hibi&s;cus, clo&s;e their flowers before the hotte&s;t part of the day comes on; and the flowers of &s;ome &s;pecies of cucubalus, and Silene, vi&s;cous campion, are clo&s;ed all day; but when the &s;un leaves them they expand, and emit a very agreeable &s;cent; whence &s;uch plants are termed noctiflora.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="15"></L>

Linneus fir&s;t ob&s;erved the Tropaeolum Majus to emit &s;parks or &s;la&s;hes in the mornings before &s;un-ri&s;e, during the months of June or July, and al&s;o during the twilight in the evening, but not after total darkne&s;s came on; the&s;e &s;ingular &s;cintillations were &s;hewn to her father and other philo&s;ophers; and Mr. Wilcke, a cele|brated electrician, believed them to be electric. Lin. Spec. Plantar. p. 490. Swedi&s;h Acts for the year 1762. Pulteney's View of Linncus, p. 220. Nor is this more won|derful than that the electric eel and torpedo &s;hould give voluntary &s;hocks of electricity; and in this plant perhaps, as in tho&s;e animals, it may be a mode of defence, by which it harra&s;&s;es or de&s;troys the night-flying in&s;ects which infe&s;t it; and probably it may emit the &s;ame &s;parks during the day, which mu&s;t be then invi&s;ible. This curious &s;ubject de&s;erves further inve&s;tigation. See Dictamnus. The cea&s;ing to &s;hine of this plant after twilight might induce one to conceive, that it ab&s;orbed and emitted light, like the Bolognian Pho&s;phorus, or calcined oy&s;ter-&s;hells, &s;o well explained by Mr. B. Wil&s;on, and by T. B. Beccari. Exper. on Pho&s;phori, by B. Wil&s;on. Dod&s;ley. The light of the evening, at the &s;ame di&s;tance from noon, is much greater, as I have repeatedly ob|&s;erved, than the light of the morning: this is owing, I &s;uppo&s;e, to the pho&s;phore&s;cent quality of almo&s;t all bodies, in a greater or le&s;s degree, which thus ab&s;orb light during the &s;un-&s;hine, and continue to emit it again for &s;ome time afterwards, though not in &s;uch quantity as to produce apparent &s;cintillations. The nectary of this plant grows from what is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the calyx; but this &s;uppo&s;ed calyx is coloured; and per|haps, from this circum&s;tance of its bearing the nectary, &s;hould rather be e&s;teemed a part of the coral.

<P>The difficulty of rai&s;ing the Orchis from &s;eed has, perhaps, been a principal rea&s;on of its not being cultivated in this country as an article of food.

Vol. VI. p. 120. It is probable either of the&s;e me|thods may &s;ucceed with the&s;e and other bulbous-rooted plants, as &s;nowdrops, and might render their cultivation profitable in this climate.

The arguments which tend to &s;hew that the warm &s;prings of this country are produced from &s;team rai&s;ed by deep &s;ubterraneous fires, and after|wards conden&s;ed between the &s;trata of the mountains, appear to me much more con|clu&s;ive, than the idea of their being warmed by chemical combinations near the &s;urface of the earth: for, 1&s;t, their heat has kept accurately the &s;ame perhaps for many centu|ries, certainly as long as we have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of good thermometers; which cannot be well explained, without &s;uppo&s;ing that they are fir&s;t in a boiling &s;tate. For as the heat of boiling water is 212, and that of the internal parts of the earth 48, it is ea&s;y to under&s;tand, that the &s;team rai&s;ed from boiling water, after being conden&s;ed in &s;ome mountain, and pa&s;&s;ing from thence through a certain &s;pace of the cold earth, mu&s;t be cooled always to a given degree; and it is probable the di&s;tance from the exit of the &s;pring, to the place where the &s;team is conden&s;ed, might be gue&s;&s;ed by the degree of its warmth.</P>

A &s;pecies of Fucus, or of Con&s;erva, &s;oon appears in all ba&s;ons which contain water. Dr. Prie&s;tley found that great quantities of pure dephlogi&s;ticated air were given up in water at the points of this vegetable, particu|larly in the &s;un&s;hine, and that hence it contributed to pre&s;erve the water in re&s;ervoirs from becoming putrid. The minute divi&s;ions of the leaves of &s;ubaquatic plants, as men|tioned in the note on Trapa, and of the gills of fi&s;h, &s;eem to &s;erve another purpo&s;e be|&s;ides that of increa&s;ing their &s;urface, which has not, I believe, been attended to, and that is to facilitate the &s;eparation of the air, which is mechanically mixed or chemically di&s;|&s;olved in water by their points or edges; this appears on immer&s;ing a dry hairy leaf in water fre&s;h from a pump; innumerable globules like quick&s;ilver appear on almo&s;t every point; for the extremities of the&s;e points attract the particles of water le&s;s forcibly than tho&s;e particles attract each other; hence the contained air, who&s;e ela&s;ticity was but ju&s;t balanced by the attractive power of the &s;urrounding particles of water to each other, finds at the point of each fibre a place where the re&s;i&s;tance to its expan&s;ion is le&s;s; and in con&s;equence it there expands, and becomes a bubble of air. It is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that the rays of the &s;un&s;hine, by being refracted and in part reflected by the two &s;urfaces of the&s;e minute air-bubbles, mu&s;t impart to them much more heat than to the tran&s;parent water; and thus facilitate their a&s;cent by further expanding them; that the points of vegetables attract the particles of water le&s;s than they attract each other, is &s;een by the &s;pherical form of dew-drops on the points of gra&s;s.

<L>Emerging TRAPA lifts her pearly head;<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Trapa.</HI> l. 200. Four males, one female. The lower leaves of this plant grow under water, and are divided into minute capillary ramifications; while the upper leaves are broad and round, and have air-bladders in their foot&s;talks to &s;upport them above the &s;urface of the water. As the a&euml;rial leaves of vegetables do the office of lungs, by ex|po&s;ing a large &s;urface of ve&s;&s;els with their contained fluids to the influence of the air; &s;o the&s;e aquatic leaves an&s;wer a &s;imilar purpo&s;e like the gills of fi&s;h; and perhaps gain from water or give to it a &s;imilar material. As the material thus nece&s;&s;ary to life &s;eems to abound more in air than in water, the &s;ubaquatic leaves of this plant, and of &s;i&s;ym|brium, coenanthe, ranunculus aquatilis, water crowfoot, and &s;ome others, are cut into fine divi&s;ions to increa&s;e the &s;urface; whil&s;t tho&s;e above water are undivided. So the plants on high mountains have their upper leaves more divided, as pimpinella, petro&s;e|linum, and others, becau&s;e here the air is thinner, and thence a larger &s;urface of contact is required. The &s;tream of water al&s;o pa&s;&s;es but once along the gills of fi&s;h, as it is &s;ooner deprived of its virtue; whereas the air is both received and ejected by the action of the lungs of land-animals. The whale &s;eems to be an exception to the above, as he receives water and &s;pouts it out again from an organ, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be a re&s;piratory one. As &s;pring-water is nearly of the &s;ame degree of heat in all climates, the aquatic plants, which grow in rills or fountains, are found equally in the torrid, temperate, and frigid zones, as water-cre&s;s, water-par&s;nip, ranunculus, and many others.</P>
<P>In warmer climates the watery grounds are u&s;efully cultivated, as with rice; and the roots of &s;ome aquatic plants are &s;aid to have &s;upplied food, as the antient Lotus in Egypt, which &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Nymphaea.&mdash;In Siberia the roots of the Butomus, or flowering ru&s;h, are eaten, which is well worth further enquiry, as they grow &s;pontane|ou&s;ly in our ditches and rivers, which at pre&s;ent produce no e&s;culent vegetables; and might thence become an article of u&s;eful cultivation.

<P>The &s;padix of this plant is frequently quite white, or coloured, and the leaves liable to be &s;treaked with white, and to have black or &s;carlet blotches on them.

<P>When the petals of the tulip become &s;triped with many colours, the plant lo&s;es almo&s;t half of its height; and the method of making them thus break into colours is by tran|&s;planting them into a meagre or &s;andy &s;oil, <HI>after they have previou&s;ly enjoyed a richer &s;oil:</HI> hence it appears, that the plant is weakened when the flower becomes variegated.

The Harmattan is a &s;ingular wind blowing from the in|terior parts of Africa to the Atlantic ocean, &s;ometimes for a few hours, &s;ometimes for &s;everal days without regular periods. It is always attended with a fog or haze, &s;o den&s;e as to render tho&s;e objects invi&s;ible which are at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile; the &s;un appears through it only about noon, and then of a dilute red, and very minute par|ticles &s;ub&s;ide from the mi&s;ty air &s;o as to make the gra&s;s, and the &s;kins of negroes appear whiti&s;h. The extreme dryne&s;s which attends this wind or fog, without dews, withers and quite dries the leaves of vegetables; and is &s;aid of Dr. Lind at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons to be fatal and malignant to mankind; probably after much preceding wet, when it may be|come loaded with the exhalations from putrid mar&s;hes; at other &s;ea&s;ons it is &s;aid to check epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, to cure fluxes, and to heal ulcers and cutaneous eruptions; which is probably effected by its yielding no moi&s;ture to the mouths of the external ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, by which the action of the other branches of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem is increa&s;ed to &s;upply the deficiency, <HI>Account of the Harmattan.

<P>The Rev. Mr. Sterling gives an account of a darkne&s;s for &s;ix or eight hours at Detroit in America, on the 19th of October, 1762, in which the &s;un appeared as red as blood, and thrice its u&s;ual &s;ize: &s;ome rain falling, covered white paper with dark drops, like &s;ulphur or dirt, which burnt like wet gunpowder, and the air had a very &s;ulphureous &s;mell. He &s;uppo&s;es this to have been emitted from &s;ome di&s;tant earthquake or volcano. Philo&s;. Tran&s;. V. LIII. p. 63.</P>
<P>In many circum&s;tances this wind &s;eems much to re&s;emble the dry fog which covered mo&s;t parts of Europe for many weeks in the &s;ummer of 1780, which has been &s;uppo&s;ed to have had a volcanic origin, as it &s;ucceeded the violent eruption of Mount Heela, and its neighbourhood. From the &s;ub&s;idence of a white powder, it &s;eems probable that the Harmattan has a &s;imilar origin, from the unexplored mountains of Africa. Nor is it improbable, that the epidemic coughs, which occa&s;ionally traver&s;e immen&s;e tracts of country, may be the products of volcanic eruptions; nor impo&s;&s;ible, that at &s;ome future time contagious mia&s;mata may be thus emitted from &s;ubterraneous furnaces, in &s;uch abundance as to contaminate the whole atmo&s;phere, and depopulate the earth!</P></NOTE></L>

The fruit of the fig is not a &s;eed-ve&s;&s;el, but a recep|tacle inclo&s;ing the flower within it. As the&s;e trees bear &s;ome male and others female flowers, immured on all &s;ides by the fruit, the manner of their fecundation was very un|intelligible, till Tourne&s;ort and Pontedera di&s;covered, that a kind of gnat produced in the male figs carried the &s;ecundating du&s;t on its wings, (Cynips P&s;enes Sy&s;t. Nat. 919.), and, penetrating the female fig, thus impregnated the flowers; for the evidence of this wonderful fact, &s;ee the word Caprification, in Milne's Botanical Dictionary. The figs of this country are all female, and their &s;eeds not prolific; and therefore they can only be propagated by layers and &s;uckers.</P>
<P>Monsieur de la Hire has &s;hewn in the Memoir. de l'Academ. de Science, that the &s;ummer figs of Paris, in Provence, Italy, and Malta, have all perfect &s;tamina, and ripen not only their fruits, but their &s;eed; from which &s;eed other fig-trees are rai&s;ed; but that the &s;tamina of the autumnal figs are abortive, perhaps owing to the want of due warmth. Mr. Milne, in his Botanical Dictionary (art. Caprification), &s;ays, that the cultivated fig-trees have a few male flowers placed above the female within the &s;ame co|vering or receptacle; which in warmer climates perform their proper office, but in colder ones become abortive. And Linneus ob&s;erves, that &s;ome figs have the navel of the receptacle open; which was one rea&s;on that induced him to remove this plant from the cla&s;s Clande&s;tine Marriage to the cla&s;s Polygamy. Lin. Spec. Plant.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e circum&s;tances I &s;hould conjecture, that tho&s;e female fig-flowers, which are clo&s;ed on all &s;ides in the fruit or receptacle without any male ones, are mon&s;ters, which have been propagated for their fruit, like barberries, and grapes without &s;eeds in them; and that the Caprification is either an antient proce&s;s of imaginary u&s;e, and blindly followed in &s;ome countries, or that it may contribute to ripen the fig by de|crea&s;ing its vigour, like cutting off a circle of the bark from the branch of a pear-tree. Tournefort &s;eems inclined to this opinion; who &s;ays, that the figs in Provence and at Paris ripen &s;ooner, if their buds be pricked with a &s;traw dipped in olive-oil. Plumbs and pears punctured by &s;ome in&s;ects ripen &s;ooner, and the part round the puncture is &s;weeter. Is not the honey-dew produced by the puncture of in&s;ects? will not wounding the branch of a pear-tree, which is too vigorous, prevent the blo&s;&s;oms from falling off; as from &s;ome fig-trees the fruit is &s;aid to fall off unle&s;s they are wounded by caprification? I had la&s;t &s;pring &s;ix young trees of the I&s;chia fig with fruit on them in pots in a &s;love; on removing them into larger boxes, they protruded very vigorous &s;hoots, and the fig all fell off; which I a&s;cribed to the increa&s;ed vigour of the plants.</P></NOTE></L>

<P>P. 7. <HI>Additional note to Curcuma.</HI> The&s;e anther-le&s;s filaments &s;eem to be an endea|vour
of the plant to produce more &s;tamens, as would appear from &s;ome experiments of
M. Reynier, in&s;tituted for another purpo&s;e: he cut away the &s;tamens of many flowers,
with de&s;ign to prevent their &s;ecundity, and in many in&s;tances the flower threw out new
filaments from the wounded part of different lengths; but did not produce new anthers.
The experiments were made on the geum rivale, different kinds of mallows, and the
aechinops ritro. Critical Review for March, 1788.</P>
<P>P. 8. <HI>Addition to the note on Iris.</HI> In the Per&s;ian Iris the end of the lower petal is
purple, with white edges and orange &s;treaks, creeping, as it were, into the mouth of the
flower like an in&s;ect; by which deception in its native climate it probably prevents a
&s;imilar in&s;ect from plundering it of its honey: the edges of the lower petal lap over
tho&s;e of the upper one, which prevents it from opening too wide on fine days, and fa|cilitates
its return at night; whence the rain is excluded, and the air admitted. See Po|lymorpha,
Rubia, and Cypripedia in Vol. I.</P>
<P>P. 12. <HI>Additional note on Chondrilla.</HI> In the natural &s;tate of the expanded flower of
the barberry, the &s;tamens lie on the petals; under the concave &s;ummits of which the
anthers &s;helter them&s;elves, and in this &s;ituation remain perfectly rigid; but on touch|ing
the in&s;ide of the filament near its ba&s;e with a fine bri&s;tle, or blunt needle, the
&s;tamen in&s;tantly bends upwards, and the anther, embracing the &s;tigma, &s;heds its du&s;t.

<P>P. 15. <HI>Addition to the note on Silene.</HI> I &s;aw a plant of the Dionaea Mu&s;cipula, Fly-trap
of Venus, this day, in the collection of Mr. Boothby at A&s;hbourn-Hall, Derby|&s;hire,
Aug. 20th, 1788; and on drawing a &s;traw along the middle of the rib of the
leaves as they lay upon the ground round the &s;tem, each of them, in about a &s;econd of
time, clo&s;ed and doubled it&s;elf up, cro&s;&s;ing the thorns over the oppo&s;ite edge of the leaf,
like the teeth of a &s;pring rap-trap: of this plant I was savoured with an elegant co|loured
drawing, by Mi&s;s Maria Jack&s;on of Tarporly, in Che&s;hire, a Lady who adds
much botanical knowledge to many other elegant acquirements.</P>

In the Apocynum Andro&s;aemifolium, one kind of Dog's bane, the anthers converge
over the nectaries, which con&s;i&s;t of five glandular oval corpu&s;cles &s;urrounding the germ;
and at the &s;ame time admit air to the nectaries at the inter&s;tice between each anther.
But when a fly inserts its probo&s;cis between the&s;e anthers to plunder the honey, they
converge clo&s;er, and with &s;uch violence as to detain the fly, which thus generally pe|ri&s;hes.
This account was related to me by R. W. Darwin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of El&s;ton, in
Nottingham&s;hire, who &s;howed me the plant in flower, July 2d, 1788, with a fly thus
held fa&s;t by the end of its probo&s;cis, and was well &s;een by a magnifying lens, and which
in vain repeatedly &s;truggled to di&s;engage it&s;elf, till the converging anthers were &s;eparated
by means of a pin: on &s;ome days he had ob&s;erved that almo&s;t every flower of this ele|gant
plant had a fly in it thus entangled; and a few weeks afterwards favoured me with
his further ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P><Q>My Apocynum is not yet out of flower. I have often vi&s;ited it, and have frequently
found four or five flies, &s;ome alive, and &s;ome dead, in its flowers; they are generally
caught by the trunk or probo&s;cis, &s;ometimes by the trunk and a leg; there is one at
pre&s;ent only caught by a leg: I don't know that this plant &s;leeps, as the flowers re|main
open in the night; yet the flies frequently make their e&s;cape. In a plant of
Mr. Ordino's, an ingenious gardener at Newark, who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great collection
of plants, I &s;aw many flowers of an Apocynum with three dead flies in each; they
are a thin-bodied fly, and rather le&s;s than the common hou&s;e-fly; but I have &s;een two
or three other &s;orts of flies thus arre&s;ted by the plant. Aug. 12, 1788.</Q></P>
<P>P. 18. <HI>Additional note on Ilex.</HI> The efficient cau&s;e which renders the hollies
prickly in Needwood Fore&s;t only as high as the animals can reach them, may ari&s;e from
the lower branches being con&s;tantly cropped by them, and thus &s;hoot forth more luxu|riant
&s;oliage: it is probable the &s;hears in garden-hollies may produce the &s;ame effect,
which is equally curious, as prickles are not thus produced on other plants.</P>
<P>P. 41. <HI>Additional note on Ulva.</HI> M. Hubert made &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the air
contained in the cavities of the bambou. The &s;tems of the&s;e canes were from 40 to 50
feet in height, and 4 or 5 inches in diameter, and might contain about 30 pints of
ela&s;tic air. He cut a bambou, and introduced a lighted candle into the cavity, which
was extinguished immediately on its entrance. He tried this about 60 times in a cavity
of the bambou, containing about two pints. He introduced mice at different times into
the&s;e cavities, which &s;eemed to be &s;omewhat affected, but &s;oon recovered their agility.
The &s;tem of the bambou is not hollow till it ri&s;es more than one foot from the earth;
the divi&s;ions between the cavities are convex downwards. Ob&s;erv. &s;ur la Physique par

<P>P. 136. <HI>Addition to the note on Tropaeolum.</HI> In Sweden a very curious phenomenon
has been ob&s;erved on certain fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">wers, by M. Haggren, Lecturer in Natural Hi&s;tory.
One evening he perceived a faint fla&s;h of light repeatedly dart from a Marigold; &s;ur|prized
at &s;uch an uncommon appearance, he re&s;olved to examine it with attention; and,
to be a&s;&s;ured that it was no deception of the eye, he placed a man near him, with orders
to make a signal at the moment when he ob&s;erved the light. They both &s;aw it con|stantly
at the &s;ame moment.</P>
<P>The light was mo&s;t brilliant on Marigolds, of an orange or flame colour; but &s;carcely
vi&s;ible on pale ones.</P>
<P>The fla&s;h was frequently &s;een on the &s;ame flower two or three times in quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
but more commonly at intervals of &s;everal minutes; and when &s;everal &s;lowers in the &s;ame
place emitted their light together, it could be ob&s;erved at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance.</P>
<P>This phaenomenon was remarked in the months of July and Aug&s;t, at &s;un-&s;et, and
for half an hour after, when the atmo&s;phere was clear; but after a rainy day, or when
the air was loaded with vapours, nothing of it was &s;een.</P>
<P>The following flowers emitted fla&s;hes, more or le&s;s vivid, in this order:</P>
<P>1. The Marigold, (<HI>Calendula Officinalis</HI>).</P>
<P>2. Garden Na&s;turtion, (Tropaeolum majus).</P>
<P>3. Orange Lily, (Lilium bulbiferum).</P>
<P>4. The Indian Pink, (Tagetes patula et crecta).</P>
<P>Sometimes it was al&s;o ob&s;erved on the Sun-flowers, (H linthus annuus). But bright
yellow, or flame colour, &s;eemed in general nece&s;&s;ary for the production of this light; for
it was never &s;een on the flowers of any other colour.</P>
<P>To di&s;cover whether &s;ome little in&s;ects, or pho&s;phoric worms, might not be the cause
of it, the flowers were carefully examined even with a micro&s;cope, without any &s;uch
being &s;ound.</P>
<P>From the rapidity of the fla&s;h, and other circum&s;tances, it might be conjectured, that
there is &s;omething of electricity in this phaenomenon. It is well known, that when the
<PB N="188" REF="571">
<HI>pi&s;til</HI> of a flower is impregnated, the <HI>pollen</HI> bur&s;ts away by its ela&s;ticity, with which elec|tricity
may be combined. But M. Haggren, after having ob&s;erved the fla&s;h from the
Orange-lily, the <HI>anthers</HI> of which are a con&s;iderable &s;pace di&s;tant from the <HI>petals,</HI> found
that the light proceeded from the <HI>petals</HI> only; whence he concludes, that this electric
light is caused by the <HI>pollen,</HI> which in flying off is &s;cattered upon the <HI>petals.</HI> Ob&s;er.

<HEAD>De&s;cription of the Poi&s;on-Tree in the I&s;land of JAVA. Tran&s;lated from the original Dutch
of N. P. Foer&s;ch.</HEAD>
<P>THIS de&s;tructive tree is called in the Malayan language <HI>Bohon-Upas,</HI> and has been
de&s;cribed by naturali&s;ts; but their accounts have been &s;o tinctured with the <HI>mar|vellou,</HI>
that the whole narration has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be an ingenious fiction by the ge|nerality
of readers. Nor is this in the lea&s;t degree &s;urpri&s;ing, when the circum&s;tances
which we &s;hall faithfully relate in this de&s;cription are con&s;idered.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge, that I long doubted the exi&s;tence of this tree, until a &s;tricter
enquiry convinced me of my error. I &s;hall now only relate &s;imple unadorned facts, of
which I have been an eye-witne&s;s. My readers may depend upon the fidelity of this
account. In the year 1774 I was &s;tationed at Batavia, as a &s;urgeon, in the &s;ervice of the
Dutch Ea&s;t-India Company. During my re&s;idence there I received &s;everal different ac|counts
of the Bohon Upas, and the violent effects of its poi&s;on. They all then &s;eemed
incredible to me, but rai&s;ed my curio&s;ity in &s;o high a degree, that I re&s;olved to inve&s;ti|gate
this &s;ubject thoroughly, and to tru&s;t only to my own ob&s;ervations. In con&s;equence
of this re&s;olution, I applied to the Governor-General, Mr. Petrus Albertus van der Parra,
for a pa&s;s to travel through the country: my reque&s;t was granted; and, having procured
<PB N="189" REF="572">
every information, I &s;et out on my expedition. I had procured a recommendation from
an old Malayan prie&s;t to another prie&s;t, who lives on the neare&s;t inhabitable &s;pot to the
tree, which is about fifteen or sixteen miles di&s;tant. The letter proved of great &s;ervice
to me in my undertaking, as that prie&s;t is appointed by the Emperor to re&s;ide there, in
order to prepare for eternity the &s;ouls of tho&s;e who for different crimes are &s;entenced to
approach the tree, and to procure the poi&s;on.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bohon-Upas</HI> is &s;ituated in the i&s;land of <HI>Java,</HI> about twenty-&s;even leagues from
<HI>Batavia,</HI> fourteen from <HI>Soura Charta,</HI> the &s;eat of the Emperor, and between eighteen
and twenty leagues from <HI>Tinkjoe,</HI> the pre&s;ent re&s;idence of the Sultan of Java. It is &s;ur|rounded
on all &s;ides by a circle of high hills and mountains; and the country round it,
to the di&s;tance of ten or twelve miles from the tree, is entirely barren. Not a tree, nor
a &s;hrub, nor even the lea&s;t plant or gra&s;s is to be &s;een. I have made the tour all around
this dangerous &s;pot, at about eighteen miles di&s;tant from the centre, and I found the
a&s;pect of the country on all &s;ides equally dreary. The ea&s;ie&s;t a&s;cent of the hills is from
that part where the old eccle&s;ia&s;lick dwells. From his hou&s;e the criminals are &s;ent for
the poi&s;on, into which the points of all warlike in&s;truments are dipped. It is of high
value, and produces a con&s;iderable revenue to the Emperor.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Account of the manner in which the Poi&s;on is procured.</HEAD>
<P>The poi&s;on which is procured from this tree is a gum that i&s;&s;ues out between the bark
and the tree it&s;elf, like the <HI>camphor.</HI> Malefactors, who for their crimes are &s;entenced
to die, are the only per&s;ons who fetch the poi&s;on; and this is the only chance they have
of &s;aving their lives. After &s;entence is pronounced upon them by the judge, they are
a&s;ked in court, whether they will die by the hands of the executioner, or whether they
will go to the Upas tree for a box of poi&s;on? They commonly prefer the latter pro|po&s;al,
as there is not only &s;ome chance of pre&s;erving their lives, but al&s;o a certainty, in
ca&s;e of their &s;afe return, that a provi&s;ion will be made for them in future by the Em|peror.
They are al&s;o permitted to a&s;k a favour from the Emperor, which is generally
of a triffing nature, and commonly granted. They are then provided with a &s;ilver or
tortoi&s;e&s;hell box, in which they are to put the poi&s;onous gum, and are properly in|&s;tructed
how to proceed while they are upon their dangerous expedition. Among other
particulars, they are always told to attend to the direction of the winds; as they are to
go towards the tree before the wind, &s;o that the effluvia from the tree are always blown
from them. They are told, likewi&s;e, to travel with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch, as that is the
only method of in&s;uring a &s;afe return. They are afterwards &s;ent to the hou&s;e of the old
prie&s;t, to which place they are commonly attended by their friends and relations. Here
they generally remain &s;ome days, in expectation of a favourable breeze. During that
time the eccle&s;ia&s;tic prepares them for their future fate by prayers and admonitions.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="573">
When the hour of their departure arrives, the prie&s;t puts them on a long leather-cap,
with two gla&s;&s;es before their eyes, which comes down as far as their brea&s;t; and al&s;o
provides them with a pair of leather-gloves. They are then conducted by the prie&s;t,
and their friends and relations, about two miles on their journey. Here the prie&s;t re|peats
his in&s;tructions, and tells them where they are to look for the tree. He &s;hews
them a hill, which they are told to a&s;cend, and that on the other &s;ide they will find a
rivulet, which they are to follow, and which will conduct them directly to the Upas.
They now take leave of each other; and, amid&s;t prayers for their &s;ucce&s;s, the delin|quents
ha&s;ten away.</P>
<P>The worthy old eccle&s;ia&s;tic has a&s;&s;ured me, that during his re&s;idence there, for up|wards
of thirty years, he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed above &s;even hundred criminals in the manner
which I have de&s;cribed; and that &s;carcely two out of twenty have returned. He &s;hewed
me a catalogue of all the unhappy &s;ufferers, with the date of their departure from his
hou&s;e annexed; and a li&s;t of the offences for which they had been condemned: to
which was added, a li&s;t of tho&s;e who had returned in &s;afety. I afterwards &s;aw another
li&s;t of the&s;e culprits, at the jail-keeper's at <HI>Soura-Charta,</HI> and found that they perfectly
corre&s;ponded with each other, and with the different informations which I afterwards
obtained.</P>
<P>I was pre&s;ent at &s;ome of the&s;e melancholy ceremonies, and de&s;ired different delin|quents
to bring with them &s;ome pieces of the wood, or a &s;mall branch, or &s;ome leaves
of this wonderful tree. I have al&s;o given them &s;ilk cords, de&s;iring them to mea&s;ure its
thickne&s;s. I never could procure more than two dry leaves that were picked up by one
of them on his return; and all I could learn from him, concerning the tree it&s;elf, was,
that it flood on the border of a rivulet, as de&s;cribed by the old prie&s;t; that it was of a
middling &s;ize; that five or &s;ix young trees of the &s;ame kind &s;tood clo&s;e by it; but
that no other &s;hrub or plant could be &s;een near it; and that the ground was of a
browni&s;h &s;and, full of &s;tones, almo&s;t impracticable for travelling, and covered with
dead bodies. After many conver&s;ations with the old Malayan prie&s;t, I que&s;tioned him
about the fir&s;t di&s;covery, and a&s;ked his opinion of this dangerous tree; upon which he
gave me the following an&s;wer:</P>
<P><Q>We are told in our new Alcoran, that, above an hundred years ago, the country
around the tree was inhabited by a people &s;trongly addicted to the &s;ins of Sodom and
Gomorrha; when the great prophet Mahomet determined not to &s;uffer them to lead
&s;uch dete&s;table lives any longer, he applied to God to puni&s;h them: upon which God
cau&s;ed this tree to grow out of the earth, which de&s;troyed them all, and rendered the
country for ever uninhabitable.</Q></P>
<P>Such was the Malayan opinion. I &s;hall not attempt a comment; but mu&s;t ob&s;erve,
that all the Malayans con&s;ider this tree as an holy in&s;trument of the great prophet to
puni&s;h the &s;ins of mankind; and, therefore, to die of the poi&s;on of the Upas is generally
<PB N="191" REF="574">
con&s;idered among them as an honourable death. For that rea&s;on I al&s;o ob&s;erved, that
the delinquents, who were going to the tree, were generally dre&s;&s;ed in their be&s;t apparel.</P>
<P>This however is certain, though it may appear incredible, that from fifteen to
eighteen miles round this tree, not only no human creature can exi&s;t, but that, in that
&s;pace of ground, no living animal of any kind has ever been di&s;covered. I have al&s;o
been a&s;&s;ured by &s;everal per&s;ons of veracity, that there are no fi&s;h in the waters, nor
has any rat, mou&s;e, or any other vermin, been &s;een there; and when any birds fly &s;o
near this tree that the effuvia reaches them, they fall a &s;acrifice to the effects of the
poi&s;on. This circum&s;tance has been a&s;certained by different delinquents, who, in their
return, have &s;een the birds drop down, and have picked them up <HI>dead,</HI> and brought
them to the old eccle&s;ia&s;tick.</P>
<P>I will here mention an in&s;tance, which proves them a fact beyond all doubt, and which
happened during my &s;tay at Java.</P>
<P>In the year 1775 a rebellion broke out among the &s;ubjects of the Ma&s;&s;ay, a &s;ove|reign
prince, who&s;e dignity is nearly equal to that of the Emperor. They refu&s;ed to
pay a duty impo&s;ed upon them by their &s;overeign, whom they openly oppo&s;ed. The
Ma&s;&s;ay &s;ent a body of a thou&s;and troops to di&s;per&s;e the rebels, and to drive them, with
their families, out of his dominions. Thus four hundred families, con&s;i&s;ting of above
&s;ixteen hundred &s;ouls, were obliged to leave their native country. Neither the Emperor
nor the Sultan would give them protection, not only becau&s;e they were rebels, but al&s;o
through &s;ear of di&s;plea&s;ing their neighbour, the Ma&s;&s;ay. In this di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation,
they had no other re&s;ource than to repair to the uncultivated parts round the Upas, and
reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion of the Emperor to &s;ettle there. Their reque&s;t was granted, on
condition of their fixing their abode not more than twelve or fourteen miles from the
tree, in order not to deprive the inhabitants already &s;ettled there at a greater di&s;tance of
their cultivated lands. With this they were obliged to comply; but the con&s;equence
was, that in le&s;s than two months their number was reduced to about three hundred.
The chiefs of tho&s;e who remained returned to the Ma&s;&s;ay, informed him of their lo&s;&s;es,
and intreated his pardon, which induced him to receive them again as &s;ubjects, thinking
them &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed for their mi&s;conduct. I have &s;een and conver&s;ed with &s;everal
of tho&s;e who &s;urvived &s;oon after their return. They all had the appearance of per&s;ons
tainted with an infectious di&s;order; they looked pale and weak, and from the account
which they gave of the lo&s;s of their comrades, of the &s;ymptoms and circum&s;tances
which attended their di&s;&s;olution, &s;uch as convul&s;ions, and other &s;igns of a violent death,
I was fully convinced that they fell victims to the poi&s;on.</P>
<P>This violent effect of the poi&s;on at &s;o great a di&s;tance from the tree, certainly appears
&s;urpri&s;ing, and almo&s;t incredible; and e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that it is po&s;&s;ible for
delinquents who approach the tree to return alive. My wonder, however, in a great
mea&s;ure, cea&s;ed, after I had made the following ob&s;ervations:</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="575">
I have &s;aid before, that malefactors are in&s;tructed to go to the tree with the wind,
and to return again&s;t the wind. When the wind continues to blow from the &s;ame
quarter while the delinquent travels thirty, or &s;ix and thirty miles, if he be of a good
con&s;titution, he certainly &s;urvives. But what proves the mo&s;t de&s;tructive is, that there
is no dependence on the wind in that part of the world for any length of time.&mdash;There
are no regular land-winds; and the &s;ea-wind is not perceived there at all, the &s;ituation
of the tree being at too great a di&s;tance, and &s;urrounded by high mountains and uncul|tivated
fore&s;ts. Be&s;ides, the wind there never blows a fre&s;h regular gale, but is com|monly
merely a current of light, &s;oft breezes, which pa&s;s through the different openings
of the adjoining mountains. It is al&s;o frequently difficult to determine from what part
of the globe the wind really comes, as it is divided by various ob&s;tructions in its pa&s;&s;age,
which ea&s;ily change the direction of the wind, and often totally de&s;troy its effects.</P>
<P>I, therefore, impute the di&s;tant effects of the poi&s;on, in a great mea&s;ure, to the con|&s;tant
gentle winds in tho&s;e parts, which have not power enough to di&s;per&s;e the poi&s;onous
particles. If high winds are more frequent and durable there, they would certainly
weaken very much, and even de&s;troy the obnoxious effluvia of the poi&s;on; but without
them, the air remains infected and pregnant with the&s;e poi&s;onous vapours.</P>
<P>I am the more convinced of this, as the worthy eccle&s;ia&s;tick a&s;&s;ured me, that a dead
calm is always attended with the greate&s;t danger, as there is a continual per&s;piration
i&s;&s;uing from the tree, which is &s;een to ri&s;e and &s;pread in the air, like the putrid &s;team of
a mar&s;hy cavern.</P>

<HEAD>Experiments made with the Gum of the UPAS-TREE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1776, in the month of February, I was pre&s;ent at the execution of thir|teen
of the Emperor's concubines, at <HI>Soura-Charta,</HI> who were convicted of infidelity
to the Emperor's bed. It was in the forenoon, about eleven o'clock, when the fair cri|minals
were led into an open &s;pace within the walls of the Emperor's palace. There
the judge pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence upon them, by which they are doomed to &s;uffer death by a
lancet poi&s;oned with Upas. After this the Alcoran was pre&s;ented to them, and they
were, according to the law of their great prophet Mahomet, to acknowledge and to
affirm by oath, that the charges brought again&s;t them, together with the &s;entence and
their puni&s;hment, were fair and equitable. This they did, by laying their right hand
upon the Alcoran, their left hands upon their brea&s;t, and their eyes lifted towards
heaven; the judge then held the Alcoran to their lips, and they ki&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>The&s;e ceremonies over, the executioner proceeded on his bu&s;ine&s;s in the following
manner:&mdash;Thirteen po&s;ts, each about five feet high, had been previou&s;ly erected. To
the&s;e the delinquents were fa&s;tened, and their brea&s;ts &s;tripped naked. In this &s;ituation
they remained a &s;hort time in continual prayers, attended by &s;everal prie&s;ts, until a &s;ignal
<PB N="193" REF="576">
was given by the judge to the executioner; on which the latter produced an in&s;trument,
much like the &s;pring lancet u&s;ed by farriers for bleeding hor&s;es. With this in&s;trument,
it being poi&s;oned with the gum of the Upas, the unhappy wretches were lanced in the
middle of their brea&s;ts, and the operation was performed upon them all in le&s;s than two
minutes.</P>
<P>My a&s;toni&s;hment was rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t degree, when I beheld the &s;udden effects
of that poi&s;on, for in about five minutes after they were lanced, they were taken with
a <HI>tremor,</HI> attended with a <HI>&s;ub&s;ultus tendinum,</HI> after which they died in the greate&s;t agonies,
crying out to God and Mahomet for mercy. In &s;ixteen minutes by my watch, which I
held in my hand, all the criminals were no more. Some hours after their death, I ob|&s;erved
their bodies full of livid &s;pots, much like tho&s;e of the <HI>Petech<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ae,</HI> their faces &s;welled,
their colour changed to a kind of blue, their eyes looked yellow, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>About a fortnight after this, I had an opportunity of &s;eeing &s;uch another execution
at Samarang. Seven Malayans were executed there with the &s;ame in&s;trument, and
in the &s;ame manner; and I found the operation of the poi&s;on, and the &s;pots in their
bodies exactly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances made me de&s;irous to try an experiment with &s;ome animals, in
order to be convinced of the real effects of this poi&s;on; and as I had then two young
puppies, I thought them the fitte&s;t objects for my purpo&s;e. I accordingly procured with
great difficulty &s;ome grains of Upas. I di&s;&s;olved half a grain of that gum in a &s;mall
quantity of arrack, and dipped a lancet into it. With this poi&s;oned in&s;trument I made
an inci&s;ion in the lower mu&s;cular part of the belly in one of the puppies. Three minutes
after it received the wound the animal began to cry out mo&s;t piteou&s;ly, and ran as la&s;t as
po&s;&s;ible from one corner of the room to the other. So it continued during &s;ix minutes,
when all its &s;trength being exhau&s;ted, it fell upon the ground, was taken with convul|&s;ions,
and died in the eleventh minute. I repeated this experiment with two other pup|pies,
with a cat, and a fowl, and found the operation of the poi&s;on in all of them the
&s;ame: none of the&s;e animals &s;urvived above thirteen minutes.</P>
<P>I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to try al&s;o the effect of the poi&s;on given inwardly, which I
did in the following manner. I di&s;&s;olved a quarter of a grain of the gum in half an
ounce of arrack, and made a dog of &s;even months old drink it. In &s;even minutes
a retching en&s;ued, and I ob&s;erved, at the &s;ame time, that the animal was delirious, as it
ran up and down the room, fell on the ground, and tumb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ed about; then it ro&s;e again,
cried out very loud, and in about half an hour after was &s;eized with convul&s;ions, and
died. I opened the body, and found the &s;tomach very much inflamed, as the inte&s;tines
were in &s;ome parts, but not &s;o much as the &s;tomach. There was a &s;mall quantity of
coagulated blood in the &s;tomach; but I could di&s;cover no orifice from which it could
have i&s;&s;ued; and therefore &s;uppo&s;ed it to have been &s;queezed cut of the lungs, by the
animal's &s;training while it was vomiting.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="577">
From the&s;e experiments I have been convinced that the gum of the Upas is the
mo&s;t dangerous and mo&s;t violent of all vegetable poi&s;ons; and I am apt to believe that
it greatly contributes to the unhealthine&s;s of that i&s;land. Nor is this the only evil
attending it: hundreds of the natives of Java, as well as Europeans, are yearly de&s;troyed
and treacherou&s;ly murdered by that poi&s;on, either internally or externally. Every man
of quality or fa&s;hion has his dagger or other arms poi&s;oned with it; and in times of war
the Malayans poi&s;on the &s;prings and other waters with it; by this treacherous practice
the Dutch &s;uffered greatly during the la&s;t war, as it occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of half their
army. For this rea&s;on, they have ever &s;ince kept fi&s;h in the &s;prings of which they drink
the water; and &s;entinels are placed near them, who in&s;pect the waters every hour, to
&s;ee whether the fi&s;h are alive. If they march with an army or body of troops into an
enemy's country, they always carry live fi&s;h with them, which they throw into the
water &s;ome hours before they venture to drink it; by which means they have been able
to prevent their total de&s;truction.</P>
<P>This account, I flatter my&s;elf, will &s;atisfy the curio&s;ity of my readers, and the few
facts which I have related will be con&s;idered as a certain proof of the exi&s;tence of this
pernicious tree, and its penetrating effects.</P>
<P>If it be a&s;ked why we have not yet any more &s;atisfactory accounts of this tree, I can
only an&s;wer, that the object to mo&s;t travellers to that part of the world con&s;i&s;ts more in
commercial pur&s;uits than in the &s;tudy of Natural Hi&s;tory and the advancement of
Sciences. Be&s;ides, Java is &s;o univer&s;ally reputed an unhealthy i&s;land, that rich travellers
&s;eldom make any long &s;tay in it; and other want money, and generally are too igno|rant
of the language to travel, in order to make enquiries. In future, tho&s;e who vi&s;it
this i&s;land will probably now be induced to make it an object of their re&s;earches, and
will furni&s;h us with a fuller de&s;cription of this tree.</P>
<P>I will therefore only add, that there exi&s;ts al&s;o a &s;ort of Cajoe-Upas on the coa&s;t of
Maca&s;&s;ar, the poi&s;on of which operates nearly in the &s;ame manner, but is not half &s;o
violent or malignant as that of Java, and of which I &s;hall likewi&s;e give a more circum|&s;tantial
account in a de&s;cription of that i&s;land.&mdash;<HI>London Magazine.</HI></P>
