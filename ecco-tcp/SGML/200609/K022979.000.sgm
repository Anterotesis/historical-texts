<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE ESSAY ON MAN was intended to have been compri&s;ed in Four Books:</P>
<P>The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> of which, the Author has given us under that title, in four Epi&s;tles.
The <HI>Second</HI> was to have con&s;i&s;ted of the &s;ame number: 1. Of the extent and li|mits
of human Rea&s;on. 2. Of tho&s;e Arts and Sciences, and of the parts of them,
which are u&s;eful, and therefore attainable, together with tho&s;e which are unu&s;eful, and
therefore unattainable. 3. Of the Nature, Ends, U&s;e, and Application of the diffe|rent
Capacities of Men. 4. Of the U&s;e of Learning, of the Science of the World,
and of Wit: concluding with a Satyr again&s;t the Mi&s;application of them, illu&s;trated by
Pictures, Characters, and Examples.</P>
<P>The <HI>Third</HI> Book regarded Civil Regimen, or the Science of Politics, in which the
&s;everal forms of a Republic were to have been examined and explained; together with the
&s;everal Modes of Religious Wor&s;hip, as far forth as they affect Society; between which,
the Author always &s;uppo&s;ed there was the mo&s;t intere&s;ting relation and clo&s;e&s;t con|nection;
&s;o that this part would have treated of Civil and Religious Society in their full
extent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fourth</HI> and la&s;t Book concerned private Ethics or practical Morality, con&s;idered
in all the Circum&s;tances, Orders, Profe&s;&s;ions, and Stations of human Life.</P>
<P>The Scheme of all this had been maturely dige&s;ted, and communicated to the L.
Bolinbroke. Dr Swift, and one or two more, and was intended for the only work of
his riper Years: But was, partly thro' ill health, partly thro' di&s;couragements from
the depravity of the times, and partly on prudential and other con&s;iderations, inter|rupted,
po&s;tponed, and, la&s;tly, in a manner laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>But as this was the Author's favourite Work, which more exactly reflected the Image
of his &s;trong capacious Mind, and as we can have but a very imperfect idea of it from the
<HI>disjecta membra Poetae</HI> that now remain, it may not be ami&s;s to be a little more particu|lar
concerning each of the&s;e projected books.</P>
<P>The FIRST, as it treats of Man in the ab&s;tract, and con&s;iders him in general under
every of his relations, becomes the foundation, and furni&s;hes out the &s;ubjects, of the
<HI>three</HI> following; &s;o that</P>
<P>The SECOND Book takes up again the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>Second</HI> Epi&s;tles of the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Book,
and treats of man in his intellectual Capacity at large, as has been explained above. Of
this, only a &s;mall part of the conclu&s;ion (which, as we &s;aid, was to have contained
a Satyr again&s;t the mi&s;application of Wit and Learning) may be found in the <HI>Fourth</HI>
Book of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> and up and down, occa&s;ionally, in the other <HI>three.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="4">
The <HI>Third</HI> Book, in like manner, rea&s;&s;umes the &s;ubject of the <HI>Third</HI> Epi&s;tle of the
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> which treats of Man in his Social, Political, and Religious Capacity. But this
part the Poet afterwards conceived might be be&s;t executed in an EPIC POEM; as the
Action would make it more animated, and the Fable le&s;s invidious; in which all the great
Principles of true and fal&s;e Governments and Religions &s;hould be chiefly delivered in
feigned Examples. In pur&s;uance of this de&s;ign, he plan'd out a Poem on the &s;ubject
of the fabulous BRUTUS, the great Grand&s;on of Aeneas: who&s;e fir&s;t and predominant
principle he makes to be Benevolence; from this Ruling Pa&s;&s;ion ari&s;es a &s;trong de&s;ire
to redeem the remains of his countrymen, then captives among&s;t the Greeks, from
&s;lavery and mi&s;ery, and to e&s;tabli&s;h their freedom and felicity on a ju&s;t form of
Civil Government. He had &s;een how fal&s;e Policy, and Super&s;titions and Vices proceed|ing
from it, had cau&s;ed the ruin of Troy; and he was enabled to avoid the <HI>one</HI> by the
lights his countrymen, whom he had now gathered from their di&s;per&s;ion, could afford
him from their ob&s;ervations on the various policies of the Grecian Cities; and to reform
the <HI>other</HI> by the Wi&s;dom he him&s;elf had gained in Italy, where Evander, as we are told
by Virgil, had reformed the reigning Super&s;titions:
<Q><L><HI>Rex Evandrus ait: non haec &s;ollemnia nobis</HI></L>
<L><HI>Vana &s;uper&s;titio veterumque ignara Deorum</HI></L>
<L><HI>Impo&s;uit&mdash;</HI></L></Q>
Thus qualified for the office of Legi&s;lation, he puts to &s;ea with a number of brave follow|ers;
enters the Atlantic Ocean; and after various traver&s;es (each of which produces &s;ome
new le&s;&s;on of Politics) he arrives in Britain, where having &s;urmounted many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
difficulties, which bring him &s;till nearer and nearer to the point the poet aims at, he at
length e&s;tabli&s;hes for his Trojans that perfect form of Civil Government which it was
our author's purpo&s;e to recommend. The poem opens (of which very few lines of
the introduction only were written) with Brutus at the Straits of Calp&eacute;, in &s;ight of the
<HI>ne plus ultra</HI> on Hercules's Pillars, debating in councel whether he &s;hould enter the
great ocean.</P>
<P>The FOURTH and la&s;t Book pur&s;ues the &s;ubject of the <HI>Fourth</HI> Epi&s;tle of the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> and
treats of <HI>Ethics,</HI> or practical Morality; and would have con&s;i&s;ted of many members; of
of which the four following Epi&s;tles were detached Portions: the <HI>two fir&s;t,</HI> on the <HI>Cha|racters
of Men and Women</HI> being the <HI>introductory</HI> part of this concluding Book.</P>

<HEAD>EPISTLE I.</HEAD>

<DIV2 TYPE="argument">
<PB REF="2">
<HEAD>ARGUMENT of the FIRST EPISTLE.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Characters</HI> of MEN.</HEAD>
<P>THAT it is not &s;ufficient for this knowledge to con&s;ider Man in the <HI>Ab&s;|tract</HI>:
<HI>Books</HI> will not &s;erve the purpo&s;e, nor yet our own <HI>Experience</HI> &s;ingly,
&vers; 1. General maxims, unle&s;s they be form'd upon <HI>both,</HI> will be but no|tional,
&vers; 10. Some Peculiarity in every man, characteri&s;tic to him&s;elf,
yet varying from him&s;elf, &vers; 15. Difficulties ari&s;ing from our own Pa&s;&s;i|ons,
Fancies, Faculties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &vers; 31. The &s;hortne&s;s of Life, to ob&s;erve in,
and the uncertainty of the <HI>Principles of action</HI> in men, to ob&s;erve by, &vers;
37, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Our <HI>own</HI> Principle of action often bid from our&s;elves, &vers; 41.
Some few Characters plain, but in general confounded, di&s;&s;embled, or incon|&s;i&s;tent,
&vers; 51. The &s;ame man utterly different in different place and &s;ea|&s;ons,
&vers; 71. Unimaginable weakne&s;&s;es in the greate&s;t, &vers; 70, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> No|thing
con&s;tant and certain but <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Nature,</HI> &vers; 95. No judging
of the <HI>Motives</HI> from the actions; the &s;ame actions proceeding from con|trary
Motives, and the &s;ame Motives influencing contrary actions, &vers; 100.
II. Yet to form <HI>Characters,</HI> we can only take the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t actions</HI> of a
man's life, and try to make them <HI>agree:</HI> The utter uncertainty of this,
from <HI>Nature</HI> it&s;elf, and from <HI>Policy,</HI> &vers; 120. <HI>Characters</HI> given according
to the <HI>rank</HI> of men of the world, &vers; 135. And &s;ome rea&s;on for it, &vers; 140.
<HI>Education</HI> alters the <HI>Nature,</HI> or at lea&s;t <HI>Character</HI> of many, &vers; 149.
<HI>Actions, Pa&s;&s;ions, Opinions, Manners, Humours,</HI> or <HI>Principles</HI> all &s;ub|ject
to change. No judging by <HI>Nature, from</HI> &vers; 158 to 178. III. It only
remains to find (if we can) his <HI>RULING PASSION</HI>: That will certainly
influence all the re&s;t, and can reconcile the &s;eeming or real incon&s;i&s;tency of
all his actions, &vers; 175. In&s;tanced in the extraordinary character of <HI>Clo|dio,</HI>
&vers; 179. A caution again&s;t mi&s;taking <HI>&s;econd qualities</HI> for <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> which
will de&s;troy all po&s;&s;ibility of the knowledge of mankind, &vers; 210. Examples
of the &s;trength of the <HI>Ruling Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> and its continuation to the la&s;t
breath, &vers; 222, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P>EPISTLE I.] This Epi&s;tle is divided into three principal parts or members: The Fir&s;t
[from &vers; 1 to 99.] treats of the difficulties in coming at the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and true <HI>Chara|cters
of Men.</HI>&mdash;The Second [from &vers; 98 to 173.] of the <HI>wrong means</HI> which both <HI>Philo|&s;ophers</HI>
and <HI>Men of the World</HI> have employed in &s;urmounting tho&s;e difficulties. And the
Third [from &vers; 174 to the end] treats of the <HI>right means</HI> with directions for the ap|plication
of them.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 1. <L><HI>Yes, you de&s;pi&s;e the man,</HI> &amp;c.]</L></Q> The Epi&s;tle is introduced [from &vers; 1 to 15]
in ob&s;erving, that the <HI>Knowledge of Men</HI> is neither to be gained by Books nor Experi|ence
alone, but by the joint u&s;e of both; for that the <HI>Maxims</HI> of the <HI>Philo&s;opher,</HI> and
the <HI>Conclu&s;ions</HI> of the <HI>Man of the World</HI> can, &s;eparately, but &s;upply a vague and &s;uper|ficial
knowledge: And often not &s;o much, as tho&s;e <HI>Maxims</HI> are founded in the ab&s;tract
<HI>notions</HI> of the writer; and the&s;e <HI>conclu&s;ions</HI> are drawn from the uncertain <HI>conjectures</HI> of
the ob&s;erver: But when the writer joins his <HI>&s;peculation</HI> to the <HI>experience</HI> of the ob&s;erver,
his <HI>notions</HI> are rectified into <HI>principles</HI>; and when the ob&s;erver regulates his <HI>experience</HI>
on the <HI>general principles</HI> of the writer, his <HI>conjectures</HI> advance into <HI>&s;cience.</HI> Such is the
rea&s;oning of this introduction; which be&s;ides its propriety to the general &s;ubject
of the Epi&s;tle, has a peculiar relation to each of its parts or members: For the
<HI>cau&s;es of the difficulty</HI> in coming at the knowledge and characters of men, explained
in the Fir&s;t, will &s;hew the importance of what is here delivered, of the <HI>joint</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="2" REF="6">
of &s;peculation and practice to &s;urmount it; and the <HI>wrong means</HI> which both <HI>philo&s;o|phers</HI>
and <HI>men of the world</HI> have employed in overcoming tho&s;e difficulties di&s;cour&s;ed of
in the Second, have their &s;ource here deduced, which is &s;een to be a <HI>&s;eparate</HI> adherence
of each to his own method of &s;tudying men, and a mutual contempt of the others.
La&s;tly, the <HI>right means</HI> delivered in the Third, will be of little u&s;e in the application,
without the direction here delivered: For tho' <HI>ob&s;ervation</HI> di&s;covered a <HI>ruling pa&s;&s;ion,</HI>
yet, without a <HI>philo&s;ophic</HI> knowledge of the human mind, we may ea&s;ily mi&s;take a
<HI>&s;econdary</HI> and <HI>&s;ub&s;idiary</HI> pa&s;&s;ion for the <HI>principal,</HI> and &s;o be never the nearer in the
Knowledge of Men. But the elegant and ea&s;y <HI>Form</HI> of the <HI>introduction</HI> equals the Pro|priety
of its <HI>matter</HI>; for the Epi&s;tle being addre&s;&s;ed to a noble per&s;on, di&s;tingui&s;hed for
his knowledge of the World, it opens, as it were, in the mid&s;t of a familiar conver&s;e,
which lets us at once into his character; where the poet, by affecting <HI>only</HI> to ridicule
the u&s;ele&s;s Knowledge of Men confined to Books, and under the appearance of extolling
only that acquired by the World, artfully in&s;inuates how equally defective this may be,
when conducted on the &s;ame narrow principle: Which is too often the ca&s;e, as <HI>men of
the world</HI> are more than ordinarily prejudiced in favour of their own ob&s;ervations for
the &s;ake of the ob&s;erver, and, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, le&s;s indulgent to the di&s;coveries of
others.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7"><Q REND="inline">VER. 15. <L><HI>There's &s;ome peculiar,</HI> &amp;c.]</L></Q> The poet enters on the Fir&s;t divi&s;ion of his
&s;ubject, <HI>the difficulties of coming at the Knowledge and true Characters of Men.</HI> The
I. cau&s;e of this difficulty, which he pro&s;ecutes from &vers; 14 to 19. is the great <HI>diver&s;ity
of Characters,</HI> of which, to abate our wonder, and not di&s;courage our inquiry, he only
de&s;ires we would <HI>grant</HI> him
<Q><L><HI>&mdash; but as many &s;orts of Mind as Mo&s;s.</HI></L></Q>
Hereby artfully in&s;inuating, that if Nature has varied the mo&s;t worthle&s;s vegetable into
above three hundred &s;pecies, we need not wonder at the like diver&s;ity in the human
mind: And if a variety in that vegetable has been thought of importance enough to
employ the lei&s;ure of a &s;erious enquirer, much more will the &s;ame quality in this
ma&s;ter-piece of Nature de&s;erve our &s;tudy and attention.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 19. <L><HI>That each from other differs, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> A &s;econd cau&s;e of this difficulty [from
&vers; 18 to 21.] is <HI>Man's incon&s;tancy,</HI> whereby not only one man differs from another,
but each man from him&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 21. <L><HI>Add Nature's, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> A third cau&s;e [from &vers; 20 to 23.] is that <HI>ob&s;curity</HI>
thrown over the Characters of men, thro' the &s;trife and conte&s;t between <HI>nature</HI> and
<HI>cu&s;tom,</HI> between <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>appetite,</HI> between <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>opinion.</HI> And as mo&s;t men,
<PB N="4" REF="8">
either thro' <HI>education, temperature,</HI> or <HI>profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> have their Characters warp'd by <HI>cu&s;tom,</HI>
<HI>appetite,</HI> and <HI>opinion,</HI> the ob&s;curity ari&s;ing from thence almo&s;t univer&s;al.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 23. <L><HI>Our depths who fathoms, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> A fourth cau&s;e from &vers; 20 to 25. is deep
<HI>di&s;&s;imulation,</HI> and re&s;tle&s;s <HI>caprice,</HI> whereby the &s;hallows of the mind are as difficult to
be <HI>found,</HI> as the depths of it to be <HI>fathom'd.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 25. <L><HI>On human actions, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> A fifth cau&s;e [from &vers; 24 to 31.] is the &s;udden
change of his <HI>Principle of action,</HI> either on the point of its being laid open and de|tected,
or thro' mere incon&s;tancy.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 31. <L><HI>Yet more; the difference, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> Hitherto the poet hath &s;poken of the cau&s;es
of difficulty ari&s;ing from the <HI>ob&s;eurity of the Object</HI>; he now comes to tho&s;e which pro|ceed
from <HI>defects in the Ob&s;erver.</HI> The Fir&s;t of which, and a &s;ixth cau&s;e of difficulty,
he &s;hews [from &vers; 30 to 57.] is the perver&s;e <HI>manners, affections,</HI> and <HI>imagination</HI> of the
ob&s;erver, whereby the Characters of others are rarely &s;een either in their true <HI>light,</HI>
<HI>complexion,</HI> or <HI>proportion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="9">
<Q REND="inline">VER. 37. <L><HI>Nor will Life's &s;tream for Ob&s;ervation, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The Second of the&s;e, and &s;eventh
cau&s;e of difficulty [from &vers; 36 to 41.] is the <HI>&s;hortne&s;s of human life,</HI> which will not
&s;uffer the ob&s;erver to &s;elect and weigh out his knowledge, but ju&s;t to &s;natch it as it
rolls rapidly by him down the current of Time.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 41. <L><HI>Oft in the Pa&s;&s;ions', &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> We come now to the eighth and la&s;t cau&s;e,
which very properly concludes the account, as, in a &s;ort, it &s;ums up all the difficulties
in one [from &vers; 40 to 51.] namely, that very often the <HI>man him&s;elf is ignorant of his
own motive of action</HI>; the cau&s;e of which ignorance our author has admirably explain'd:
When the mind (&s;ays he) is now quite tired out by the long conflict of oppo&s;ite mo|tives,
it withdraws its attention, and &s;uffers the <HI>will</HI> to be &s;eized upon by the fir&s;t that
afterwards obtrudes it&s;elf, without taking notice what that motive is. This is finely
illu&s;trated by what he &s;uppo&s;es the general cau&s;e of dreams; where the fancy ju&s;t let
loo&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it&s;elf of the <HI>la&s;t image</HI> which it meets with on the confines between &s;leep
and waking, and on that eracts all its vi&s;ionary operation; yet this image is, with great
difficulty, recollected; and never, but when &s;ome accident happens to interrupt our
fir&s;t &s;lumbers: Then (which proves the truth of the hypothe&s;is) we are &s;ometimes able to
trace the workings of the Fancy backwards, from image to image, in a chain, till we
come to that from whence they all aro&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="10">
<Q REND="inline">VER. 51. <L><HI>True, &s;ome are open, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> But now in an&s;wer to all this, an <HI>objector,</HI> as
the author &s;hews [from &vers; 50 to 61.] may &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"That the&s;e difficulties &s;eem to be aggra|vated:
For many Characters are &s;o plainly marked, that no man can mi&s;take them:
And not &s;o only in the more <HI>open</HI> and <HI>frank,</HI> but in the very <HI>clo&s;e&s;t</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>reclu&s;e</HI>
likewi&s;e."</Q> Of each of which the objector gives an in&s;tance, whereby it appears, that
the forbidding clo&s;ene&s;s and concealed hypocri&s;y in the one, are as con&s;picuous to all
mankind, as the gracious openne&s;s and frank plain-dealing of the other. &mdash; The
Reader &s;ees this objection is more particularly level'd at the doctrine of &vers; 23.
<Q><L><HI>Our</HI> depths <HI>who fathoms, and our</HI> &s;hallows <HI>finds?</HI></L></Q>
for it here endeavours to prove, that both are equally explorable.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="11">
<Q REND="inline">VER. 63. <L><HI>But the&s;e plain Characters, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> To this objection, therefore, our au|thor
replies [from &vers; 60 to 67.] that indeed the fact may be true in the in&s;tances
given, but that &s;uch <HI>plain characters</HI> are extremely rare: And for the truth of this,
he not only appeals to experience, but explains the cau&s;es of it: 1. The Fir&s;t of
which is, the <HI>vivacity of the Imagination</HI>; for that when the bias of the Pa&s;&s;ions is
enough determined to mark out the Character, yet then, as the vigour of the Fancy
generally ri&s;es in proportion to the &s;trength of the Appetites, the one no &s;ooner directs
the bias, than the other rever&s;es it,
<Q><L><HI>Tho'</HI> &s;trong <HI>the bent, yet</HI> quick <HI>the turns of mind.</HI></L></Q>
2. A Second cau&s;e is the <HI>contrariety of Appetites,</HI> which drawing &s;everal ways, as <HI>Avarice</HI>
and <HI>Luxury, Ambition</HI> and <HI>Indolence, &amp;c.</HI> they mu&s;t needs make the &s;ame Character in|con&s;i&s;tent
to it&s;elf, and con&s;equently inexplicable to the ob&s;erver,

<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 66. <L><HI>Or Affectations, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> 3. A Third cau&s;e is <HI>Affectation,</HI> that a&s;pires to qua|lities,
which neither <HI>nature</HI> nor <HI>education</HI> has given us, and which, con&s;equently, nei|ther
<HI>art</HI> nor <HI>u&s;e</HI> will ever render graceful or becoming. On this account it is, he well
ob&s;erves, that <HI>Affectation rever&s;es the &s;oul</HI>; other <HI>natural pa&s;&s;ions</HI> may indeed turn it
from that bias which the <HI>ruling one</HI> has given it; but the <HI>affected pa&s;&s;ions</HI> di&s;tort all its
faculties, and cramp all its operations; &s;o that it acts with the &s;ame con&s;traint that a
tumbler walks upon his hands.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 69. <L><HI>Unthought of frailties, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> 4. A Fourth cau&s;e lies in the <HI>Inequalities <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">

find them going together, and therefore as

This does not a little contribute to our
confounding Characters; for they are, in
reality, very different and di&s;tinct; &s;o

<HI>Pride</HI> without ambition or vanity; and
Cicero had <HI>Vanity</HI> without pride or am|bition.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 1. <L><HI>Nothing &s;o true, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The
reader perhaps may be di&s;appointed to find
that this <HI>Epi&s;tle,</HI> which propo&s;es the &s;ame
&s;ubject with the preceding, is conducted
on very different rules of method; for
in&s;tead of being di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;ame lo|gical
connection, and filled with the like
philo&s;ophical remarks, it is wholly taken
up in drawing a great variety of capital
Characters: But if he would reflect,
that the <HI>two Sexes</HI> make but <HI>one Spe|cies,</HI>
and con&s;equently, that the Cha|racters
of both mu&s;t be &s;tudied and ex|plained
on the &s;ame principles, he would
&s;ee, that when the poet had done this
in the preceding Epi&s;tle, his bu&s;ine&s;s here
was, not to repeat what he had already
delivered, but only to verify and illu|&s;trate
his doctrine, by every <HI>view</HI> of that
perplexity of Nature, which his philo&s;o|phy
only can explain. If the reader there|fore
will but be at the pains to &s;tudy
the&s;e Characters with any degree of at|tention,
as they are here ma&s;terly drawn,
one important particular (for which the
poet has artfully prepared him by the in|troduction)
will very forcibly &s;trike his
ob&s;ervation; and that is, that all the great
&s;trokes in the &s;everal Characters of <HI>Wo|men</HI>
are not only infinitely perplexed and
di&s;cordant, like tho&s;e in <HI>Men,</HI> but ab&s;o|lutely
incon&s;i&s;tent, and in a much higher
degree <HI>contradictory.</HI> As &s;trange as this
may appear, yet he will &s;ee that the poet
has all the while &s;trictly follow'd Nature,
who&s;e ways, we find by the former Epi|&s;tle
<PB N="25" REF="29">
are not a little my&s;terious; and a
my&s;tery this might have remained, had
not our author explained it at &vers; 207.
where he &s;huts up his <HI>Characters</HI> with this
philo&s;ophical reflexion:
<Q><L><HI>In Men, we</HI> various ruling Pa&s;&s;ions <HI>find,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In Women,</HI> two <HI>almo&s;t divide the kind;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tho&s;e only fix'd they fir&s;t or la&s;t obey,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The love of Plea&s;ure, and the love of Sway.</HI></L></Q>
If this account be true, we &s;ee the per|petual
nece&s;&s;ity (which is not the ca&s;e in
<HI>Men</HI>) that <HI>Women</HI> lye under of <HI>di&s;gui&s;ing</HI>
their <HI>ruling Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> Now the variety of
arts employed to this purpo&s;e mu&s;t needs
draw them into infinite contradictions in
tho&s;e <HI>Actions</HI> from whence their general
and obvious Character is denominated:
To verify this ob&s;ervation, let the reader
examine all the Characters here drawn,
and try whether with this key he cannot
di&s;cover that all their Contradictions ari&s;e
from a de&s;ire to hide the <HI>ruling Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>But this is not the wor&s;t. The poet
afterwards [from &vers; 219 to 248.] takes no|tice
of another mi&s;chief ari&s;ing from this
nece&s;&s;ity of hiding their ruling Pa&s;&s;ions;
which is, that generally the end of each
is defeated even there where they are
mo&s;t violently pur&s;ued: For the nece&s;&s;ity
of hiding them inducing an habitual di&s;&s;i|pation
of mind, Rea&s;on, who&s;e office it
is to regulate the <HI>ruling Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> lo&s;es
all its force and direction; and the&s;e un|happy
victims to their principles, tho'
with their attention &s;till <HI>fixed</HI> upon them,
are ever pro&s;ecuting the means de&s;tructive
of their end, and thus become ridiculous
in youth, and mi&s;erable in old age.</P>
<P>Let me not omit to ob&s;erve the great
beauty of the conclu&s;ion: It is an Enco|mium
on the Lady to whom the Epi&s;tle
is addre&s;&s;ed, and artfully turns upon the
fact which makes the &s;ubject of the Epi|&s;tle,
the <HI>contradiction of a Woman's Chara|cter,</HI>
in which contradiction he &s;hews that
all the lu&s;tre of the be&s;t Character con&s;i&s;ts.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 5. <L><HI>How many pictures</HI>]</L></Q> The
poet's purpo&s;e here is to &s;hew, that the

illu&s;trates by &s;o happy a <HI>Similitude,</HI> that

in the cour&s;e of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, I have
given many in&s;tances, and &s;hall here ex|plain
in what it con&s;i&s;ts; it is this, that
the <HI>Similitudes</HI> in his didactic poems, of
which he is not &s;paring, and which are
highly poetical, are always cho&s;en with
&s;uch exqui&s;ite di&s;cernment of Nature, as
not only to illu&s;trate the particular point
he is upon, but to e&s;tabli&s;h the general
principles he would inforce; &s;o, in the
in&s;tance before us, he compares the in|con&s;tancy
and contradiction in the Cha|racters
of Women, to the change of
colours in the Chameleon; yet 'tis ne|verthele&s;s
the great principle of this poem
to &s;hew that the general Characteri&s;tic of
the Sex, as to the Ruling Pa&s;&s;ion, which
they all have, is more uniform than that in
Man: Now for this purpo&s;e, all Nature
could not have &s;upplied &s;uch another il|lu&s;tration
as this of the Chameleon; for
tho' it in&s;tantaneou&s;ly a&s;&s;umes much of
the colour of every &s;ubject on which it
chances to be placed, yet, as the mo&s;t
accurate <HI>Virtuo&s;i</HI> have ob&s;erved, it has
two native colours of its own, which,
amid&s;t all the&s;e charges are never totally
di&s;charged, but, tho' often di&s;coloured
by the neighbourhood of adventitious
ones, &s;till make the foundation, and give
a tincture to all tho&s;e which, from thence,
it occa&s;ionally a&s;&s;umes.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 157. <L><HI>Yet Cloe &s;ure, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The
purpo&s;e of the poet in this Character is
important: It is to &s;hew that the poli|tic
or prudent government of the pa&s;|&s;ions
is not enough to make a Chara|cter
amiable, nor even to &s;ecure it from
being ridiculous, if the end of that go|vernment
be not pur&s;ued, which is the
free exerci&s;e of the &s;ocial appetites after
the &s;elfi&s;h ones have been &s;ubdued; For
that if, tho' rea&s;on govern, the heart be
never con&s;ulted, we intere&s;t our&s;elves as
little in the fortune of &s;uch a Character,

And the civil di&s;mi&s;&s;ion he gives them by
the continuance of the &s;ame metaphor, in

The poet concludes his Epi&s;tle with a fine
<HI>Moral,</HI> that de&s;erves the &s;erious attention

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 1. <L><HI>Who &s;hall decide, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The addre&s;s of the <HI>Introduction</HI> [from &vers; 1 to 21.]
is remarkable: The poet repre&s;ents-him&s;elf and the noble Lord his friend, as in a
conver&s;ation, philo&s;ophi&s;ing on the <HI>final cau&s;e</HI> of <HI>Riches:</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="45">
<HI>You</HI> (&s;ays our author)
<Q><L><HI>&mdash; hold the word from Jove to Momus giv'n,</HI></L>
<LG>
<L><HI>But I, who think more highly of our kind, &amp;c.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Opine that Nature, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG></Q>
As much as to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"You, my Lord, hold the &s;ubject we are upon as fit only for
<HI>Satyr</HI>; I, on the contrary, e&s;teem it a ca&s;e of Philo&s;ophy and profound <HI>Ethics:</HI>
But as we both agree in the main <HI>Principle,</HI> that <HI>Riches were not given for the re|ward
of Virtue, but for very different purpo&s;es</HI> [See <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Man,</HI> Ep. IV.] let us
<PB N="42" REF="46">
compromi&s;e the matter, and con&s;ider the &s;ubject jointly, both under your idea and
mine, <HI>i. e. Satyrically</HI> and <HI>Philo&s;ophically.</HI>"</Q> &mdash; And this, in fact, we &s;hall find to
be the true character of this poem, which is a <HI>Species</HI> peculiar to it&s;elf, and partaking
equally of the nature of his <HI>Ethic Epi&s;tles</HI> and his <HI>Satyrs,</HI> as the be&s;t pieces of
<HI>Lucian</HI> aro&s;e from a combination of the Dialogues of <HI>Plato,</HI> and the Scenes of <HI>Ari&s;to|phanes.</HI>
This it will be nece&s;&s;ary to carry with us, if we would &s;ee either the <HI>Wit</HI>
or the <HI>Rea&s;oning</HI> of this Epi&s;tle in their true light.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 21. <L><HI>What Nature wants, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> Having thus &s;ettled the terms of the <HI>Debate,</HI>
before he comes to the <HI>main Que&s;tion,</HI> the <HI>U&s;e of Riches,</HI> it was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cu&s;s a
<PB N="43" REF="47">
<HI>previous</HI> one, whether indeed they are upon the whole, <HI>u&s;eful to mankind or not</HI>; [which
he does from &vers; 20 to 77.] It is commonly ob&s;erved, &s;ays he [from &vers; 21 to 35.]
<HI>That Gold mo&s;t commodiou&s;ly &s;upplies the wants of Nature:</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Let us fir&s;t con&s;ider the
propo&s;ition in <HI>general,</HI> both in <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Expre&s;&s;ion</HI>; 1. As it regards the <HI>Supply</HI>;
and this we &s;hall find to be very <HI>unequal:</HI> 2. As it regards the <HI>Wants</HI>; and the&s;e,
we &s;hall &s;ee, are very <HI>ambiguous</HI>; under that term, all our fanta&s;tic and imaginary
as well as real wants being comprized. Hitherto the u&s;e is not very apparent. Let
us in the &s;econd place, therefore, con&s;ider the propo&s;ition in <HI>particular,</HI> or how
Gold &s;upplies the <HI>wants of Nature</HI> both in private and public life: 1. As to <HI>private</HI>;
<PB N="44" REF="48">
it aids us, indeed, to &s;upport life; but it, at the &s;ame times, hires the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in:
2. As to <HI>Society</HI>; it may procure Friend&s;hips and extend Trade; but it allures Rob|bers
and corrupts our acquaintance. 3. As to <HI>Government</HI>; it pays the Guards ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for the &s;upport of public liberty; but it may, with the &s;ame ea&s;e, bribe a
Senate to overturn it."</Q></P>
<P>The matter therefore being thus problematical, the poet, in&s;tead of formally ba|lancing
between the <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Ill,</HI> chu&s;es to leave this <HI>previous Que&s;tion undetermined,</HI>
(as <HI>Tacitus</HI> had done before him; where, &s;peaking of the ancient <HI>Germans,</HI> he &s;ays,
<HI>Argentum et aurum propitii aut irati Dii negaverint dubito</HI>;) and falls at once upon what
he e&s;teems the <HI>principal</HI> of the&s;e abu&s;es, <HI>public Corruption.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="49">
For having in the la&s;t in&s;tance, of the <HI>U&s;e of Riches</HI> in Government, &s;poken of <HI>ve|nal
Senates,</HI> he goes on to lament the mi&s;chief as de&s;perate and remedile&s;s; <HI>Gold,</HI>
by its power to corrupt with <HI>Secrecy,</HI> defeating all the efforts of public Spirit, whe|ther
exerted in the Courage of Heroes, or in the Wi&s;dom of Patriots.</P>
<P>'Tis true indeed, continues the poet [from &vers; 34 to 51.] the very weight of the
Bribery has &s;ometimes detected the Corruption:
<Q><L><HI>From the crack'd bag the dropping Guinea</HI> &s;poke<HI>, &amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
But this inconvenience was &s;oon repaired, by the invention of <HI>Paper credit:</HI> Who&s;e
dreadful effects on public Liberty he de&s;cribes in all the colouring of his poetry,
heightened by the warme&s;t concern for virtue; which now makes him willing to
give up, as it were, the <HI>previous que&s;tion,</HI> in a pa&s;&s;ionate wi&s;h [from &vers; 49 to 59.] for
the return of that incumbrance attendant on public Corruption, before the &s;o <HI>common</HI>
u&s;e of money.</P>
<P>And plea&s;ed with this flattering Idea, he goes on [from &vers; 58 to 77.] to &s;hew the
other advantages that would accrue from <HI>Riches only in kind</HI>; which are, that neither
<HI>Avarice</HI> could contrive to hoard, nor <HI>Prodigality</HI> to lavi&s;h, in &s;o mad and boundle&s;s a
manner as they do at pre&s;ent. Here he &s;hews particularly, in a fine ironical de&s;cri|ption
of the embarras on <HI>Gaming,</HI> how effectually it would eradicate that execrable
practice.</P>
<P>But this whole <HI>Digre&s;&s;ion</HI> [from &vers; 34 to 79.] has another very uncommon beauty;
<PB N="46" REF="50">
for, at the &s;ame time that it ari&s;es naturally from the <HI>la&s;t</HI> con&s;ideration in the debate
of the <HI>previous Que&s;tion,</HI> it artfully denounces, in our entrance on the <HI>main Que&s;tion,</HI>
the principal topics intended to be employed for the dilucidation of it, namely AVA|RICE,
PROFUSION, and PUBLIC CORRUPTION.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="52">
<Q REND="inline">VER. 77. <L><HI>Since then, my Lord, on &s;uch a World, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> Having thus ironically de&s;cribed
the incumbrance which the want of money would occa&s;ion to all criminal exce&s;&s;es in
the u&s;e of Riches, particularly to <HI>Gaming,</HI> which being now become of public con|cern,
he affects much regard to:
<Q><L><HI>Oh filthy check to all indu&s;trious &s;kill,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To &s;poil the Nation's la&s;t great trade, Quadrille!</HI></L></Q>
he concludes the <HI>previous Que&s;tion</HI> without deciding it, in the &s;ame <HI>ironical</HI> manner,
<Q><L><HI>Since then, my Lord, on &s;uch a World we fall,</HI></L>
<L><HI>What &s;ay you? Say? Why take it, Gold and all.</HI></L></Q>
That is, &s;ince for the&s;e great purpo&s;es we mu&s;t have <HI>Money,</HI> let us now <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly</HI> in|quire
into its <HI>true U&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 79. <L><HI>What Riches give us, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> He examines therefore in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place [from
&vers; 80 to 99.] I. <HI>Of what U&s;e Riches are to our&s;elves.</HI><Q><L><HI>What Riches give us let us then enquire?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Meat, Fire, and Cloaths. What more? Meat, Cloaths, and Fire.</HI></L></Q> The mere <HI>turn</HI> of the expre&s;&s;ion here &s;hews, without further rea&s;oning, that all the
infinite ways of &s;pending <HI>on our&s;elves,</HI> contrived in the in&s;olence of Wealth, by tho&s;e
who would <HI>more than live,</HI> are only the&s;e <HI>three</HI> things diver&s;ified throughout every wea|ried
mode of Luxury and Wantonne&s;s.</P>
<P>Yet as little as this is, adds the poet, [from &vers; 81 to 85.] it is only to be had by the
<HI>moderate u&s;e</HI> of Riches; <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Profu&s;ion</HI> not allowing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the mo&s;t
exorbitant wealth even this little:
<Q><L><HI>Alas! 'tis more than</HI> Turner <HI>finds they give.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Alas! 'tis more than, all his vi&s;ions pa&s;t,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Unhappy</HI> Wharton <HI>waking found at la&s;t.</HI></L></Q>
But what is it you would expect them to give? continues the poet [from &vers; 84 to 91.]
Would you have them capable of <HI>re&s;toring</HI> tho&s;e <HI>real</HI> ble&s;&s;ings, which men have <HI>lo&s;t</HI> by
their <HI>Vices</HI> or their <HI>Villanies</HI>; or of <HI>&s;atisfying</HI> tho&s;e <HI>imaginary</HI> ones, which they have
<HI>gotten</HI> by their <HI>irregular Appetites</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI>; <HI>the&s;e,</HI> &s;ure, the bad or fooli&s;h man can|not
<PB N="49" REF="53">
have the face to demand; and <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> by the wi&s;e provi&s;ion of Nature, Riches are
incapable of giving if he had.</P>
<P>But now admit, pur&s;ues our author [from &vers; 90 to 97.] that wealth might, in &s;ome
ca&s;es alleviate the unmerited mi&s;eries of life, by procuring medicines both for the mind
and body; yet it is not to be thought it &s;hould operate like a charm, while only worn
about one: Yet this, the&s;e <HI>poor men of pelf</HI> expect from it, while <HI>Avarice,</HI> on the one
hand, witholds them from giving at all, even to the <HI>Doctor</HI> in extremity; or <HI>Vanity</HI>
diverts the donation from a <HI>Friend</HI> in life, to the Endowment of a <HI>Cat</HI> or <HI>College</HI> at
their death. It is true, <HI>Riches</HI> might give the greate&s;t of all ble&s;&s;ings, a <HI>virtuous con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s</HI>
of our having employ'd them as became the <HI>&s;ub&s;titutes of Providence,</HI>
<Q><L><HI>To ea&s;e or emulate the care of Heav'n,</HI> <BIBL>&vers; 230.</BIBL></L></Q>
in acts of BENEFICENCE and CHARITY; and this <HI>U&s;e</HI> is next to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="54">
<Q REND="inline">VER. 97. <L><HI>To &s;ome indeed, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> For now the poet comes, in the Second place, to
examine, II. <HI>Of what u&s;e Riches are to others</HI>; which he teaches, as is his way through|out
this poem, by the <HI>abu&s;e</HI> that &s;tands oppo&s;ed to it: Thus he &s;hews [from &vers; 96 to
107.] that with regard to acts of <HI>Beneficence,</HI> the utmo&s;t Heaven will grant to tho&s;e
who &s;o greatly abu&s;e its ble&s;&s;ings, is either to enrich &s;ome favourite <HI>Ba&s;tard,</HI> and &s;o
perpetuate their vice and infamy; or el&s;e, contrary to their intent, a legitimate <HI>Son
they hated,</HI> and &s;o expo&s;e to public &s;corn and ridicule, the defeat of their unnatural cru|elty.
But with regard to acts of <HI>Charity,</HI> they are given up to &s;o reprobate a &s;en&s;e,
as to believe they are then &s;econding the de&s;igns of Heaven, when they pur&s;ue the
indigent with imprecations, or leave them in the mid&s;t of their di&s;tre&s;&s;es unrelieved, as
the common enemies of God and Man.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="55">
<Q REND="inline">VER. 107. <L><HI>Yet to be ju&s;t, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> Having thus &s;hewn the <HI>true u&s;e</HI> of Riches in a
de&s;cription of the <HI>abu&s;e,</HI> and how that u&s;e is perpetually defeated by <HI>Profu&s;ion</HI> and
<HI>Avarice,</HI> it was natural to enquire into the &s;pring and original of the&s;e vices; as the
<HI>abu&s;e</HI> they occa&s;ion, mu&s;t be well under&s;tood, before it can be corrected. The
di&s;po&s;ition, therefore, of his &s;ubject now calls upon him to come to the <HI>Philo|&s;ophy</HI>
of it: And he examines particularly into the <HI>Motives</HI> of <HI>Avarice:</HI> But what is
very ob&s;ervable, he, all along, &s;atyrically, intermixes with the <HI>real motives,</HI> &s;everal
<HI>imaginary</HI>; and tho&s;e as wild as imagination could conceive. This, which at fir&s;t &s;ight
might &s;eem to vitiate the purpo&s;e of his <HI>philo&s;ophical inquiry,</HI> is found, when duly con|&s;idered,
to have the highe&s;t art of de&s;ign. His bu&s;ine&s;s, the reader &s;ees, was to prove
that the <HI>real motives</HI> had the highe&s;t extravagancy: Nothing could more conduce to
this end, than the &s;etting them by, and comparing them with, the mo&s;t extravagant
that the fancy it&s;elf could invent; in which &s;ituation it was &s;een, that the <HI>real</HI> were
full as wild as the <HI>fictitious.</HI> To give the&s;e images all the force they were capable of,
he fir&s;t de&s;cribes [from &vers; 118 to 123.] the <HI>real</HI> and a different <HI>imaginary</HI> motive in
<PB N="52" REF="56">
the <HI>&s;ame per&s;on:</HI> and then [from &vers; 122 to 133.] an <HI>imaginary</HI> one, and a <HI>real,</HI> the very
&s;ame with the imaginary in <HI>different per&s;ons.</HI> This addre&s;s the poet him&s;elf alludes to
&vers; 155.
<Q><L><HI>Le&s;s mad the wilde&s;t whim&s;y we can frame, &amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
Let me ob&s;erve, that this has &s;till a further beauty, ari&s;ing from the <HI>nature</HI> of the
poem, which (as we have &s;hewn) is partly <HI>&s;atyrical,</HI> and partly <HI>philo&s;ophical.</HI>&mdash;With
regard to the <HI>particular</HI> beauties of this di&s;po&s;ition, I &s;hall only take notice of one;
where the poet introduces the <HI>fictitious</HI> motive of Blunt's avarice, by a wizard's pro|phecy:
<Q><L><HI>At length Corruption, like a gen'ral flood</HI></L>
<L><HI>(So long by watchful mini&s;ters with&s;tood)</HI></L>
<L><HI>Shall deluge all; and</HI> Av'rice <HI>creeping on</HI></L>
<L><HI>Spread like a low-born mi&s;t, and blot the Sun, &amp;c.</HI></L>
<L><HI>See Britain &s;unk in lucre's &s;ordid charms,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And France reveng'd on Anne and Edward's arms.</HI></L></Q>
For it was the poet's purpo&s;e, in this poem, to &s;hew, that the <HI>main</HI> and <HI>principal abu&s;e</HI>
of Riches ari&s;es from AVARICE.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="59">
<Q REND="inline">VER. 151. <L><HI>All this is madne&s;s, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> But now the <HI>Sage,</HI> who has confined him&s;elf
to <HI>books,</HI> which pre&s;cribe the <HI>government of the pa&s;&s;ions</HI>; and never looked out upon the
world, where he might &s;ee them let loo&s;e, and, like Milton's devils, <HI>riding the air in
whirlwind,</HI> cries out, <HI>all this is madne&s;s.</HI> True, replies the poet [from &vers; 151 to 177.]
but this madne&s;s is a common one, and only to be prevented by a &s;evere attention to
the rule laid down in the <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI>

<Q><L><HI>The</HI> ruling Pa&s;&s;ion<HI>, be it what it will,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The</HI> ruling Pa&s;&s;ion <HI>conquers Rea&s;on &s;till.</HI></L></Q>
But then (continues he) as wild as this pa&s;&s;ion appears by the &s;way of its overbearing
bias, it would be &s;till more &s;en&s;ele&s;s had it no bias at all. You have &s;een us here
intermix with the <HI>real,</HI> the mo&s;t <HI>fanta&s;tical</HI> and extravagant that imagination could
form; yet even the&s;e are le&s;s extravagant than a <HI>ruling Pa&s;&s;ion without a con&s;tant aim.</HI>
Would you know the rea&s;on? then li&s;ten to this important truth: <Q REND="inline">"'Tis HEAVEN

Mi&s;er's cruelty to others, naturally introduces the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> by a &s;atyrical apology, &s;hew|ing
that he is full as cruel to him&s;elf: The explanation of which extraordinary phe|nomenon
brings the author into the <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> of his &s;ubject; and this ending in an
ob&s;ervation of Avarice and Profu&s;ion's correcting and reconciling one another, as
naturally introduces the <HI>third,</HI> which proves the truth of the ob&s;ervation from <HI>fact.</HI>
And thus the <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> of his <HI>&s;ubject</HI> &s;tanding between his <HI>Precepts</HI> and <HI>Examples,</HI>
gives &s;trength and light to both, and receives it reflected back again from both.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t gives us two examples [from &vers; 176 to 219.] of the&s;e oppo&s;ite <HI>ruling Pa&s;|&s;ions,</HI>

of wit or worth</HI>; from &s;uch as could <HI>rea&s;on</HI> them&s;elves [as we &s;ee by &vers; 183, <HI>&amp; &s;eqq.</HI>

capable of doing; he therefore chu&s;es &s;uch an in&s;tance, as proves, that a man with

that the poet's precepts for the <HI>true u&s;e of money,</HI> are of more <HI>general</HI> &s;er|vice
than a bad heart will give an indifferent head leave to conceive. This was a truth
of the greate&s;t importance to inculcate: He therefore [from &vers; 249 to 297.] exalts the
character of a <HI>very private</HI> man, one Mr. J. Kyrle, of Hereford&s;hire: And, in end|ing
his de&s;cription, &s;truck as it were with admiration at a &s;ublimity of his own crea|ting,
and warmed with &s;entiments of a Gratitude he had rai&s;ed in him&s;elf in behalf of

<Q><L><HI>And what? no monument, in&s;cription, &s;tone?</HI></L>
<L><HI>His race, his form, his name almo&s;t unknown.</HI></L></Q>
Then, tran&s;ported with indignation at a contrary object, he exclaims,

<L><HI>Should'ring God's altar a vile image &s;tands,</HI></L>

And this he illu&s;trates [from &vers; 299 to 339.] in de&s;cribing the unhappy deaths of the

has beautifully contra&s;ted. The mi&s;erable end of the&s;e two extraordinary per&s;ons na|turally
leads the poet into this humane reflexion, however ludicrou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed,
<Q><L><HI>Say, for &s;uch worth, are other worlds prepar'd?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Or are they both, in this, their own reward?</HI></L></Q>

<PB N="66" REF="70">
and importance of a Profe&s;&s;or ready addre&s;s'd to plunge him&s;elf into the very depths of

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P>EPISTLE IV.] The extremes of <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Profu&s;ion</HI> being treated of in the fore|going
Epi&s;tle; this takes up one particular branch of the latter, the <HI>Vanity of Expence</HI>
in people of Wealth and Quality; and is therefore a corollary to the preceding. It is
equally remarkable for exactne&s;s of method with the re&s;t. But the nature of the &s;ub|ject,
which is le&s;s philo&s;ophical, makes it capable of being analy&s;ed in a much nar|rower
compa&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 1. <L><HI>'Tis &s;trange, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The poet's introduction [from &vers; 1 to 39.] con&s;i&s;ts of
a very curious <HI>remark,</HI> ari&s;ing from his intimate knowledge of nature, together with
an <HI>illu&s;tration</HI> of it, taken from his ob&s;ervations on life. It is this, that the Prodigal
no more <HI>enjoys</HI> his Profu&s;ion, than the Mi&s;er his Rapacity. It was generally thought,
that <HI>Avarice</HI> only <HI>kept</HI> without enjoyment; but the poet here fir&s;t acquaints us with
a circum&s;tance in human life much more to be lamented, viz. that <HI>Profu&s;ion</HI> too can
<HI>communicate</HI> without it; whereas <HI>Enjoyment</HI> was thought to be as peculiarly the reward
of the <HI>beneficent</HI> pa&s;&s;ions (of which this &s;eems to have the appearance) as <HI>want</HI> of en|joyment
was the puni&s;hment of the <HI>&s;elfi&s;h.</HI>&mdash;The phaenomenon ob&s;erved is odd enough.
But if we look more narrowly into this matter, we &s;hall find, that Prodigality, when
in pur&s;uit of <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> is only a <HI>Mode of Vanity,</HI> and con&s;equently as &s;elfi&s;h a pa&s;&s;ion as even
Avarice it&s;elf, and it is of the ordonance and con&s;titution of all &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions, when
growing to exce&s;s, to defeat their own end, which is <HI>Self-enjoyment.</HI> But be&s;ides the
accurate philo&s;ophy of this ob&s;ervation, there is a fine <HI>Morality</HI> contained in it; namely
that <HI>ill-got</HI> Wealth is not only as unrea&s;onably, but as <HI>uncomfortably</HI> &s;quandered as it
was raked together; which the poet him&s;elf further in&s;inuates in &vers; 15.
<Q><L><HI>What brought Sir Vi&s;to's</HI> ill-got wealth <HI>to wa&s;te &mdash;</HI></L></Q>
He then illu&s;trates this ob&s;ervation by divers examples in every branch of <HI>wrong Ta&s;te</HI>;
and to &s;et their ab&s;urdities in the &s;tronge&s;t light, he, in conclu&s;ion, contra&s;ts them
<PB N="76" REF="80">
with &s;everal in&s;tances of the <HI>true,</HI> in the noble Lord to whom the Epi&s;tle is addre&s;&s;ed.
This di&s;po&s;ition is productive of various beauties: for, by this means, the <HI>Introduction</HI>
becomes an <HI>epitome</HI> of the body of the Epi&s;tle; which, as we &s;hall &s;ee, con&s;i&s;ts of ge|neral
reflections on <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> and particular examples of <HI>bad</HI> and <HI>good.</HI> And his
friend's Example concluding the Introduction, leads the poet gracefully into the &s;ub|ject
it&s;elf; for this Lord, here celebrated for his good Ta&s;te, was now at hand
to deliver the fir&s;t and fundamental percept of it him&s;elf, which gives authority
and dignity to all that follow.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="83">
<Q REND="inline">VER. 39. <L><HI>Oft have you hinted to your brother Peer,</HI></L><L><HI>A certain truth&mdash;</HI>]</L></Q>and in this artful manner begins the body of the Epi&s;tle.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t part of it, [from &vers; 38 to 95.] delivers rules for attaining to the MAGNI|FICENT
in ju&s;t expence; which is the &s;ame in Building and Planting, that the SUB|LIME
is in Painting and Poetry; and, con&s;equently, the qualities nece&s;&s;ary for the
attainment of both mu&s;t have the &s;ame relation.</P>
<P>1. The fir&s;t and <HI>fundamental,</HI> he &s;hews [from &vers; 38 to 47.] to be SENSE.<Q><L>Good Sen&s;e<HI>, which only is the gift of Heav'n,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And, tho' no Science, fairly worth the Seven.</HI></L></Q> And for <HI>that</HI> rea&s;on; not only as it is the foundation and parent of them all, and the
con&s;tant regulator and director of their operations, or, as the poet better expre&s;&s;es it,
<HI>&mdash; of every Art the Soul</HI>; but likewi&s;e as it alone can, in ca&s;e of need, very often
&s;upply the offices of every one of them.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="84">
<Q REND="inline">VER. 47. <L><HI>To build, to plant, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> 2. The next quality, for dignity and u&s;e, is
TASTE, and but the next: For, as the poet truly ob&s;erves, there is <HI>&mdash; &s;omething
previous ev'n to Ta&s;te &mdash; 'tis Sen&s;e</HI>; and this, in the order of things: For <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> is a ta&s;te
and true conception of <HI>Nature</HI>; and <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> is a &s;en&s;e or true conception of <HI>beautiful
Nature</HI>; but we mu&s;t fir&s;t know the <HI>E&s;&s;ences</HI> of things, before we can judge truly of
their <HI>Qualities.</HI> The bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> therefore, in the pur&s;uit of <HI>Magnificence,</HI> is,
as the poet &s;hews us [from &vers; 46 to 65.] 1. [to &vers; 51.] to catch or lay hold on <HI>Nature,</HI>
where &s;he appears mo&s;t in her charms. 2. [to &vers; 57.] To adorn her, when taken, as
be&s;t &s;uits her dignity and quality; that is, to dre&s;s her in the light and mode&s;t habit of
a virgin, not load her with the gaudy ornaments of a pro&s;titute. This rule ob&s;erved,
will prevent a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion in the following, which is, not to let all its beauties be
&s;een at once, but in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; for that advantage is in&s;eparable from a graceful and
well-dre&s;&s;ed per&s;on. 3. [to &vers; 65.] To take care that the ornaments be well &s;uited to
<HI>that part,</HI> which it is your purpo&s;e to adorn; and, as in dre&s;&s;ing out a <HI>mode&s;t Fair,</HI>
(which is the poet's own compari&s;ion) the colours are proportioned to her complexion;
the &s;tuff, to the embonpoint of her per&s;on; and the fa&s;hion, to her air and &s;hape;

the Gardens of <HI>Villario,</HI> and the Groves of <HI>Sabinus</HI> (which are the in&s;tances

mi&s;taken for it, and <HI>ornamented</HI> as beautiful Nature &s;hould be: The&s;e ornaments, there
fore, being de&s;titute of all real &s;upport, mu&s;t be continually &s;ubject to change. Some|times
the owner him&s;elf will grow weary of them (as in the ca&s;e of <HI>Villario</HI>) and find

filling it
<Q><L><HI>&mdash; with imitating fools.</HI></L></Q>
For men are apt to take the example next at hand; and apte&s;t of all to take a bad one.
No fear of that, replies the poet [from &vers; 172 to 177.] Nothing ab&s;urd or wrong
is exempt from the juri&s;diction of Time, which is always &s;ure to do full ju&s;tice on it,
<Q><L><HI>Another age &s;hall &s;ee the golden Ear</HI></L>

The imagery is here taken from <HI>Painting,</HI>
in the judicious execution of the <HI>Pencil,</HI>
and in the happy improvement of it by <HI>time.</HI>
To under&s;tand what is meant by <HI>&s;upporting</HI>
(which is a term of art common both to
<HI>Planting</HI> and <HI>Painting</HI>) we mu&s;t con&s;ider
what things make the natural defect or

the&s;e are, the having a di&s;agreable flat|ne&s;s,
and the not having a <HI>proper termi|nation.</HI>

away the one, and gives what is wanting
of the other.<Q><L><HI>&mdash; The parts unite.</HI></L></Q> The utmo&s;t which art can do, when it does
its full office, is to give the work a <HI>con&s;ent</HI>
of parts; but it is <HI>time</HI> only that can
make the <HI>union</HI> here &s;poken of, there
being the &s;ame difference between the&s;e,
as between a &s;imple <HI>Contract,</HI> and a <HI>Con|&s;ummation.</HI>
So in painting, the &s;kill
of the <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> can go no further, in the
chromatic part, than to &s;et tho&s;e colours
together, which have a natural friend&s;hip
and &s;ympathy for each other: But no|thing
but <HI>time</HI> can unite and incorporate
their tints.<Q><L><HI>And &s;trength of Shade contends with
&s;trength of Light.</HI></L></Q> And now the work becomes a <HI>very</HI> pi|cture;
which the poet informs us of, in
the &s;ublime way of poetical in&s;truction,
by &s;etting that picture before our eyes;
and not merely a picture, but a <HI>perfect</HI>
one, in which the lights and &s;hades, not
only bear a <HI>proportion</HI> to one another
in their force (which is implied in the
word <HI>contends</HI>) but are both at their
<HI>height</HI> (which the word <HI>&s;trength</HI> &s;ignifies.)

&s;hades and lights &s;hould be great and broad,

the Ornament it&s;elf pretends to
&s;cience, and would ju&s;tify its u&s;e by

the ancients, was &s;acred, and full

abhorrence which it is wont to do in us;
but, on the contrary, very agreeable &s;en|&s;ations,
corre&s;pondent to tho&s;e foreign a&s;|&s;ociations.
Hence, and more e&s;pecially
becau&s;e the Serpent was the peculiar <HI>Sym|bol

&s;o widely mi&s;take, it is no wonder that
tho&s;e who pretend to none, I mean the
verbal Critics, &s;hould a little <HI>hallucinate</HI>
in this matter. I remember, when the
&s;hort Latin in&s;cription on Shake&s;pear's
monument was fir&s;t &s;et up, and in the
very &s;tyle of elegant and &s;imple anti|quity,
the News-papers were full of the&s;e
&s;mall Critics; in which, the only ob&s;er|vation
that looked like learning, was
founded in this ignorance of Ta&s;te and
Antiquity. One of the&s;e Critics objected
to the word <HI>Mors</HI> (in the in&s;cription)
becau&s;e the Roman writers of the pu|re&s;t
times &s;crupled to employ it; but,
in its &s;tead, u&s;ed an improper, that is, a
