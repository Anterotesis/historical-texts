<L>Who with her&s;elf, and others from her Birth,</L>
<L>Finds all her Life one Warfare upon Earth;</L>

<L>The wi&s;e&s;t Fool much Time has ever made:</L>
<L>From Lovele&s;s Youth to unre&s;pected Age,</L>

<L>La&s;t Night her Lord was all that's good and great;</L>
<L>A Knave this Morning, and his Will a Cheat.</L>
<L>Strange! by the Means defeated of the Ends.</L>
<L>By Spirit, robb'd of Power; by Warmth, of Friends;</L>
