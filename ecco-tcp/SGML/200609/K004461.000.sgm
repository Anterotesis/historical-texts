<BIBL>TITUS 1. 7. <HI>fir&s;t Clau&s;e.</HI></BIBL>
<Q> A BISHOP MUST BE BLAMELESS, AS THE STEWARD OF GOD.&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN forming general conclu&s;ions from particular in&s;tances, e&s;pecially when our experience of the&s;e in&s;tances has not been uniform, great caution is nece&s;&s;ary, on every &s;ub|ject, to pre&s;erve us from mi&s;takes. But a peculiar degree of caution is nece&s;&s;ary in forming general maxims concerning <HI>characters</HI>; becau&s;e the circum&s;tances on which characters de|pend, are both more complicated, and more uncertain in their operation, than the cau&s;es of <HI>natural effects.</HI> On this account, ob&s;ervations mu&s;t be made on a very great number of indivi|duals, before we can judge with accuracy concerning the cha|racter of the nation or the profe&s;&s;ion, to which the&s;e individu|als belong: and even after we have made the mo&s;t exten&s;ive ob&s;ervations, we ought &s;till to remember, that the maxim, which we form, far from being an univer&s;al truth, will nece&s;|&s;arily be liable to numberle&s;s exceptions.</P>
<P>IT is however undeniable, that there are few &s;ubjects, on which men judge, either more ra&s;hly, or more dogmatically, than on the characters both of nations and of particular profe&s;|&s;ions. They impute the faults, which they have ob&s;erved in a few individuals, to a whole nation or order. They often al&s;o embrace the groundle&s;s prejudice &s;o clo&s;ely, that, when they afterwards di&s;cover many other individuals, who appear to be
<PB N="2" REF="3">
free from the blemi&s;h, which they had expected to find in them, they &s;uppo&s;e them to be tainted with it notwith&s;tand|ing, and take it for granted, that it would become obvious in proper circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>IN no in&s;tance has this &s;hameful prejudice been indulged more freely, than in forming a di&s;advantageous idea of the clergy in general, on account of the vices of &s;ome, who have been members of that &s;ociety. And, becau&s;e mini&s;ters are the public teachers of chri&s;tianity, the vices imputed to them in a body, without evidence, have been con&s;idered as throwing a reflexion on the truth or the efficacy of the religion which it is their bu&s;ine&s;s to publi&s;h. The charge has been commonly en|forced by loo&s;e and popular declamation, fit to make an im|pre&s;&s;ion on the imagination of the thoughtle&s;s, and, by con&s;e|quence, to gain their pa&s;&s;ions to the party; but ab&s;olutely in|&s;ufficient to convince the impartial and inqui&s;itive. If there be any difficulty in confuting the accu&s;ations, that are com|monly brought again&s;t our order, and again&s;t the go&s;pel on our account, it ari&s;es, not from the &s;trength of the arguments, by which they are &s;upported, but from the total want of argu|ment.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t natural and direct method of proving, that the clergy de&s;erve the di&s;agreeable character, which is &s;ometimes a&s;cribed to them, would doubtle&s;s be, to examine the temper and conduct of the &s;everal individuals, and to &s;hew, from an intimate knowledge of them, that the majority are really guil|ty of the vices imputed to the order. A candid enquirer would likewi&s;e choo&s;e, before he pronounced &s;entence concern|ing their character on the whole, to compare them with the individuals of other profe&s;&s;ions, and to &s;ee what proportion the virtues and the vices of the <HI>clergy</HI> bear to tho&s;e of the <HI>laity.</HI> It will &s;carce be pretended, that this &s;pecies of proof has been attempted by tho&s;e, who are &s;o liberal in their declamations a|gain&s;t the vices of the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel.&mdash;But tho' they could produce this proof in it's greate&s;t &s;trength, it would
<PB N="3" REF="4">
&s;till be difficult to &s;hew, that the faults of mini&s;ters can be ju&s;t|ly charged on the chri&s;tian religion, to the rules of which, it is manife&s;t, the&s;e faults are ab&s;olutely contrary. The moral tendency of the doctrines of the go&s;pel, and the purity and &s;u|blimity of its precepts ought always to pre&s;erve it free from blame, on account of the vices of any, who profe&s;s to believe it. Before the&s;e vices be imputed to the go&s;pel, it &s;hould cer|tainly be &s;hown, that there is &s;ome doctrine, or precept, or ex|ample, recommended in &s;cripture, which gives countenance to them.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the method of proof, which we have mentioned, be the mo&s;t natural and direct, upon a &s;ubject of this kind, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that another &s;pecies of rea&s;oning may be likewi&s;e u&s;ed. All arguments concerning matter of fact are ultimately founded on experience; but it is not nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e in every argument to experience of in&s;tances preci&s;ely &s;imilar to that which we infer. It is often &s;ufficient, that the pre&s;ent argument be &s;upported by &s;ome general max|ims, which are clearly deducible from experience. We may conclude that a man, who is intru&s;ted with ab&s;olute power, will probably abu&s;e it, not only from in&s;tances of tyrants, who have abu&s;ed it, but al&s;o from the more general ob&s;ervation of examples which occur of corruption and in&s;olence in private life. In like manner could it be fairly proved, that there are circum&s;tances e&s;&s;ential to the mini&s;terial office, which, accord|ing to our general ob&s;ervation of human nature, have a direct and primary tendency to produce certain vices in tho&s;e, who exerci&s;e that office; and &s;hould it be inferred from this, that the&s;e vices will be characteri&s;tical of the order, and that the religion, which in&s;titutes the office, is the occa&s;ion of them; we could not ju&s;tly refu&s;e to admit the inference. This me|thod of proof has been attempted by a late author, in an <HI>E&s;&s;ay on national characters.</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>The character, which he draws, is this; " 'Tis a trite, but not alto|gether a fal&s;e maxim, that "Prie&s;ts of all religions are the &s;ame;" and tho' the character of the profe&s;&s;ion will not, in every in&s;tance, prevail over the per&s;onal character, yet it is &s;ure always to predominate with the greater num|ber. For as Chymi&s;ts ob&s;erve, that &s;pirits, when rai&s;ed to a certain height, are all the &s;ame, from whatever materials they he extracted; &s;o the&s;e men, being elevated above humanity, acquire a uniform character, which is entire|ly their own, and which, in my opinion, is, generally &s;peaking, not the mo&s;t amiable, that is to be met with in human &s;ociety. It is, in mo&s;t points, op|po&s;ite to that of a &s;oldier; as is the way of life, from which it is derived.</P>
<P>Tho' all mankind have a &s;trong propen&s;ity to religion at certain times and in certain di&s;po&s;itions; yet are there few or none, who have it to that degree, and with that con&s;tancy, which is requi&s;ite to &s;upport the character of this profe&s;&s;ion. It mu&s;t, therefore, happen, that clergymen, being drawn from the common ma&s;s of mankind, as people are to other employments, by the views of profit, the greate&s;t part, tho' no athei&s;ts or freethinkers, will find it nece&s;&s;ary, on particular occa&s;ions, to feign more devotion than they are, at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t time, po&s;&s;e&s;t of, and to maintain the appearance of fervour and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, even when jaded with the exerci&s;es of their religion, or when they have their minds engaged in the common occupations of life. They mu&s;t not, like the re&s;t of the world, give &s;cope to their natural movements and &s;entiments: they mu&s;t &s;et a guard over their looks and words and acti|ons; and in order o &s;upport the veneration paid them by the ignorant vul|gar, they mu&s;t not only keep a remarkable re&s;erve, but mu&s;t promote the &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;tition, by a continued grimace and hypocri&s;y. This di&s;&s;imula|tion often de&s;troys the candour and ingenuity of their tempers, and makes an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> in their characters.</P>
<P>If by chance any of them be po&s;&s;e&s;t of a temper more &s;u&s;ceptible of de|votion, than u&s;ual, &s;o that he has but LITTLE occa&s;ion for hypocri&s;y to &s;up|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rt the character or his profe&s;ion; 'tis &s;o natural for him to over-rate this adv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ntage, and to think it atones for every violation of morality, that fre|quently he is not more virtuous than the hypocrite. And tho' few dare open|ly avow the&s;e exploded opinions, "that every thing is lawful to the &s;aints, an that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y alone have a property in their goods;" yet may we ob&s;erve, that the&s;e princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ples link in every bo&s;om, and repre&s;ent a zeal for religious ob&s;er|vances as &s;o great a merit, that it may compen&s;ate for many vices and enor|mities. This ob&s;ervation is &s;o common, that all prudent men are on their guard, when they meet with any extraordinary appearance of religion; tho' at the &s;ame t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">me, they confe&s;s, that there are many exceptions to this gene|ral rule, and that probity and &s;uper&s;tition are far from being incompatible.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t men are ambitious; but the ambition of other men may commonly be &s;atisfied, by excelling in their particular profe&s;&s;ion, and thereby promoting the in ere&s;ts of &s;ociety. The ambition of the clergy can often be &s;atisfied only by promoting ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition and implicit faith and pious frauds. And having got what Archimedes only wanted (viz. another world, on which he could fix his engines) no wonder they move this world at their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t men have an over-weening conceit of them&s;elves, but tho&s;e have a peculiar temptation to that vice, who are regarded with &s;uch veneration, and are even deem'd &s;acred, by the ignorant multitude.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t men are apt to bear a particular regard for the members of their own profe&s;&s;ion; but as a lawyer, or phy&s;ician, or merchant does, each of them, follow out his bu&s;ine&s;s apart, the intere&s;ts of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions are not &s;o clo&s;e|ly united as the intere&s;ts of clergymen of the &s;ame religion; where the whole body gains by the veneration, paid to their common tenets, and by the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>Few men can bear contradiction with patience; but the clergy too often proceed even to a degree of fury on this article: becau&s;e all their credit and livelihood depend upon the belief, which their opinions meet with; and they alone pretend to a divine and &s;upernatural authority, or have any colour for repre&s;enting their antagoni&s;ts as impious and prophane. The Odium Theo|logicum, or theological hatred, is noted even to a proverb, and means that degree of rancour, which is the mo&s;t furious and implacable.</P>
<P>Thus many of the vices of human nature are, by &s;ixt moral cau&s;es, inflam|ed in that profe&s;&s;ion; and tho' &s;everal individuals e&s;cape the contagion, yet all wi&s;e governments will be on their guard again&s;t the attempts of a &s;ociety, who will for ever combine into one faction, and while it acts as a &s;ociety, will for ever be actuated by ambition, pride, and a per&s;ecuting &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The temper of religion is grave and &s;erious; and this is the character re|quir'd of prie&s;ts, which confines them to &s;trict rules of decency, and common|ly prevents irregularity and intemperance among&s;t them. The gaiety, much le&s;s the exce&s;&s;es of plea&s;ure, is not permitted in that body; and this virtue is, perhaps, the only one they owe to their profe&s;&s;ion. In religions, indeed, founded on &s;peculative principles, and where public di&s;cour&s;es make a part of religious &s;ervice, it may al&s;o be &s;uppo&s;ed that the clergy will have a con|&s;iderable &s;hare in the learning of the times; tho' 'tis certain that their ta&s;te in eloquence will always be better than their &s;kill in rea&s;oning and philo&s;ophy. But whoever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the other noble virtues of humanity, meekne&s;s, and moderation, as very many of them, no doubt, do, is beholden for them to na|ture or reflexion, not to the genius of his calling." <BIBL>Hume's E&s;&s;ays Moral and Political, E&s;&s;ay 24.</BIBL></P>
<P>THIS is a repre&s;entation chiefly of the MORAL character of the clergy; and to that the following di&s;cour&s;e is wholly confined. But as an in&s;inuation is likewi&s;e made to the di&s;advantage of their INTELLECTUAL character, it will be proper to remark, that this in&s;inuation is, both of little weight, and, in a great mea&s;ure, without foundation.&mdash;It is of little weight; for ta&s;te is more general among all men, than &s;kill in philo&s;ophy. A greater num|ber can judge of beauty, than of truth. Many are moved by the eloquence of a di&s;cour&s;e, who cannot examine the ju&s;tne&s;s of the rea&s;oning. We meet much oftener with a degree of imagination, and &s;en&s;ibility of temper, &s;ufficient to form a good &s;peaker, than with the penetration, which is nece&s;&s;ary for in|ve&s;tigating the cau&s;es of things, and inventing ju&s;t theories. It can be no reflexion on the clergy, that ta&s;te is more univer&s;al, than philo&s;ophical geni|us, in their profe&s;&s;ion, as well as in all other profe&s;&s;ions. Their ta&s;te will na|turally be better in eloquence, than in other arts, becau&s;e their office leads them to apply e&s;pecially to that.&mdash;In every &s;en&s;e, in which it can be con&s;idered as a reflexion on our order, the in&s;inuation is entirely groundle&s;s. Were mankind per&s;uaded, that we are unacquainted with the rules of ju&s;t rea&s;oning, and only qualified for popular declamation on principles taken for granted without enquiry; this might perhaps incline them to li&s;ten to tho&s;e, who tell them that the truths of religion, which we teach, are mere fables, de&s;titute of evidence, tho' we he not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a degree of rea&s;on, &s;ufficient for detecting the fallacious arguments produced in &s;upport of them; it might prepare them for expecting wonderful di&s;coveries in the writings of infidels, and prejudice them again&s;t our vindications of religion. I will not &s;ay, that this author made the in&s;inuation with a de&s;ign to promote this end, becau&s;e he has not informed us what is his de&s;ign. But I will &s;ay, this end can be really promoted by nothing le&s;s, than a proof that the clergy are weak rea|&s;oners, in compari&s;on with the re&s;t of mankind; and I will venture to affirm, that neither the nature of their employment, nor experience of their real character, gives rea&s;on for repre&s;enting them in this light. Their profe&s;&s;ion turns their attention to eloquence, but does not divert it from ju&s;t rea&s;oning. Their public functions lead them to employ all their powers of per&s;ua&s;ion, in inculcating truth and goodne&s;s on their hearers; their &s;tudies lead them al&s;o to examine mo&s;t que&s;tions of importance, to enquire into the ab&s;tru&s;e&s;t truths, and to detect the mo&s;t &s;ubtle errors. Corruptions of religion, interwoven with the tenets of a fal&s;e philo&s;ophy, have &s;ometimes retarded the improve|ment of &s;cience; but it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of mini&s;ters to teach only pure religi|on; it is a perver&s;ion of their office to &s;upport corruptions of religion, and the effects of this perver&s;ion cannot ju&s;tly be imputed to the genuine &s;pirit of the office. In fact, the clergy have never been remarkably defective in the knowledge of philo&s;ophy. There have been periods, in which the philo|&s;ophy of the times was almo&s;t wholly confined to them. When the &s;chola&s;tic philo&s;ophy prevailed aniver&s;ally, they di&s;covered as great &s;ubtlety, as men of other profe&s;&s;ions. As great a proportion of the clergy, as of any other cla&s;s, have excelled in the knowlege, both of nature, and of the human mind. It is natural for freethinkers to reckon the rea&s;onings of the clergy, concerning religion, weak and inconclu&s;ive, becau&s;e they are contradictory to their own; but we are not afraid to de&s;ire the world to compare the writings of men of our order, with tho&s;e of the mo&s;t admired infidels, in re&s;pect either of the truth of the principles, from which they argue, or of the &s;trength and clo&s;e|ne&s;s of the arguments.</P></NOTE> Declining the direct proof of the
<PB N="4" REF="5">
vices, commonly imputed to the clergy, from immediate ex|perience,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
he has drawn a character for them (tho' he admits of
<PB N="6" REF="7">
very many exceptions in individuals) which is by no means a|miable, a character, which includes many of the blacke&s;t vices in human nature; and he has endeavoured to prove, that this character naturally re&s;ults from the very genius of the mini&s;te|rial calling.</P>
<P>THAT candour, which the go&s;pel recommends, and which ought always to prevail in the heart of a mini&s;ter of the go|&s;pel, forbids me to attempt detracting from the real merit or abilities of this author. He is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very con&s;iderable &s;hare of genius and penetration. This will gain him attenti|on from the inqui&s;itive; and will render his rea&s;onings on e|very &s;ubject, more &s;pecious than tho&s;e of many others, and on that account more dangerous, when, at any time, he happens to mi&s;take. Is is not, then, worth while, my reverend fathers
<PB N="7" REF="8">
and brethren, to enquire, whether his charge be ju&s;t? Will it be un&s;uitable to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to examine fairly and impartially, what is the natural influence of the mini&s;terial of|fice upon the characters of tho&s;e, who exerci&s;e it?</P>
<P>THE ungainly portrait, that has been drawn for the mini|&s;ters of the go&s;pel, &s;ugge&s;ted this inve&s;tigation to my thoughts. When I found my&s;elf obliged, by the authority of my &s;uperi|ors, to appear in this place, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, I willing|ly cho&s;e this &s;ubject. It affords me an opportunity of con&s;i|dering the mini&s;terial character and office, in a point of view, in which they have not been frequently regarded. It frees me from the nece&s;&s;ity of even <HI>&s;eeming</HI> to give directions to tho&s;e, from whom it becomes me rather to receive in&s;truction; for the very nature of the de&s;ign confines me to enquiry. At the &s;ame time, it will appear, that the enquiry is far from being merely &s;peculative, or unimproving, and that it has, on the contrary, the mo&s;t intimate connexion with practice. I enter on it, with a &s;incere de&s;ire to vindicate our &s;acred function from reproach; and will conduct it with an eye e&s;pecially to that author, to whom I have referred already. Prie&s;ts of the temper which he de&s;cribes, would unite in the bittere&s;t invec|tives again&s;t an antagoni&s;t, who has attacked the whole bo|dy of the clergy, in a manner &s;o unre&s;erved. But that is not the temper of the mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I know well, that my reverend hearers would not excu&s;e me, if I made the lea&s;t approach to rancour, or unbecoming warmth again&s;t him, if I oppo&s;ed him in any other &s;pirit, than <HI>the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s,</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 1.</NOTE> or if I con&s;idered my &s;ubject in any other manner, than with that impartiality, which will be ob&s;erved by tho&s;e, who &s;eek only to di&s;cover truth.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays in my text, <HI>A bi&s;hop mu&s;t be blame|le&s;s, as the &s;teward of God.</HI> It will be evident that the&s;e words lead naturally to the propo&s;ed enquiry, if we attend to the
<PB N="8" REF="9">
manner, in which they are introduced, e&s;pecially if we con&s;i|der, at the &s;ame time, the import of the words them&s;elves in the original. The apo&s;tle reminds <HI>Titus, ver.</HI> 5. that he had left him in <HI>Crete</HI> for this purpo&s;e, that he might ordain elders or pre&s;byters in every city; men blamele&s;s, free not only from gro&s;s and &s;candalous wickedne&s;s, but from every &s;pecies of vice; for the word here u&s;ed has a re&s;pect to the judgment of God, and not merely to the &s;entiments of men.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See 1 Cor. i. 22. Col. i. 22.</NOTE> In my text, he &s;hows that, when he required pre&s;byters to be blame|le&s;s, he enjoined only what the very nature of their office de|mands. A pre&s;byter i, by his office, <HI>a bi&s;hop,</HI> that is, <HI>an over|&s;eer</HI>; and, according to the language of the new te&s;tament, as appears from the only place, where the term is u&s;ed in &s;uch a way, that its meaning can be preci&s;ely determined, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. 2S.</NOTE> <HI>an o|ver&s;eer of all the flock, of the church of God.</HI> On this account, he <HI>mu&s;t be blamele&s;s:</HI> &s;teddy and univer&s;al virtue, as far as it can be attained by human nature, is a qualification, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the exerci&s;e of his office. To render the nece&s;&s;ity of this character &s;till more evident, the apo&s;tle adds, <HI>as the &s;teward of God.</HI> He repre&s;ents the chri&s;tian church as the fa|mily of God, and informs us, that mini&s;ters are appointed to di&s;pen&s;e, to the &s;everal members of it, that &s;piritual food, by which they may be nouri&s;hed to eternal life. As he el&s;ewhere characterizes them more explicitely, they are <HI>&s;tewards of the my&s;teries of God,</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 1.</NOTE> teachers, not of their own opinions, but of the doctrines of the chri&s;tian revelation. The import of the text is, therefore, plainly this; <Q REND="inline">the mo&s;t exalted and blame|le&s;s virtue is requi&s;ite, from the very nature of their office, in tho&s;e, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to teach religion, and to over|&s;ee the morals of the people.</Q> Does not this a&s;&s;ertion of the apo&s;tle imply, that the mini&s;terial office has a tendency upon the whole to form a good and virtuous character? Could his maxim be true, if that very office had an unalterable tendency to inflame many of the ba&s;e&s;t vices of human nature, and to produce a character which every good man mu&s;t regard with
<PB N="9" REF="10">
indignation? May not we, then, with &s;ufficient propriety, take occa&s;ion from this text to enquire, what is that temper, which our employment, as mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, tends to cultivate in our &s;ouls?</P>
<P>IN pro&s;ecuting this &s;ubject, I will, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> enquire how far a tendency in the mini&s;terial office, to form a character in &s;ome re&s;pects di&s;agreeable, or even a character expo&s;ed to the dan|ger of becoming vicious, could rea&s;onably affect either the cre|dit of that office, or the excellence of the chri&s;tian religion, in which the office is founded.</P>

<P N="1">I. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I WILL enquire, how far a tendency in the mi|ni&s;terial office, to form a character in &s;ome re&s;pects di&s;agreea|ble, or a character expo&s;ed to the danger of becoming vicious, could rea&s;onably affect either the credit of that office, or the excellence of the chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P>IT is not unu&s;ual to draw, from an argument, a conclu&s;ion totally different from that, which it really proves; and, by means of the ambiguity of words, or the confu&s;ion of men's i|deas, the fallacy often e&s;capes detection, and it is taken for granted that a propo&s;ition is proved, for which, in fact, there has not been a &s;ingle argument propo&s;ed. Attempts have been &s;ometimes made to &s;hew that the occupation of mini&s;ters tends to pre ent their acquiring that artificial poli&s;h, which adds gracefulne&s;s to the behaviour of the higher ranks of man|kind: and when plau&s;ible evidence for this trivial charge has been produced, men have triumphed, as if they had demon|&s;trated
<PB N="10" REF="11">
a very different propo&s;ition, that the character of our profe&s;&s;ion is po&s;itively di&s;agreeable, contemptible or ridiculous. In like manner, when men have produced &s;uch arguments as &s;eem to make it probable, that the turn of character and man|ners, which is promoted by the genius of the mini&s;terial of|fice, will be unfit to engage the <HI>liking</HI> of the generality, or will be <HI>di&s;agreeable</HI> in &s;ome &s;ituations, they have taken it for granted, that the&s;e arguments prove with equal force, that this turn of character and manners is likewi&s;e po&s;itively <HI>vicious,</HI> and unfit to gain the inward <HI>e&s;teem,</HI> or the moral <HI>approbation</HI> of men.</P>
<P>A MODERATE degree of under&s;tanding might pre&s;erve a per&s;on from being deceived by &s;ophi&s;ms &s;o palpable. But per&s;ons of good under&s;tanding are often not &s;o ready to exert a very &s;mall degree of reflection, as to receive every thing, without examination, which can gratify their own pride, or afford them mirth, by repre&s;enting others as proper objects of contempt or ridicule. For this rea&s;on the&s;e arguments, or o|thers equally inconclu&s;ive, have in fact occa&s;ioned a great part of the contempt, which has been poured out upon the clergy. It will not, therefore, be unnece&s;&s;ary to remark, tho' the re|mark be extremely obvious, that a character not only may be agreeable, when many agreeable qualities are wanting in it, becau&s;e the mere ab&s;ence of them gives no po&s;itive di&s;gu&s;t; but al&s;o may be really di&s;agreeable, or unfit to engage a gene|ral liking, and yet be &s;o far from vicious, that it &s;hall, on the contrary, command the moral approbation, and force the good opinion, and even the veneration of mankind.</P>
<P>AS characters and actions may be con&s;idered in various lights, they may gratify a &s;pectator, by &s;entiments totally di|&s;tinct and different. The&s;e &s;entiments are very apt to be con|founded, becau&s;e they are all agreeable; but every man, who de&s;ires to think with accuracy, mu&s;t be at pains to pre&s;erve them &s;eparate. A <HI>liking</HI> to a character, is very different from
<PB N="11" REF="12">
the <HI>approbation</HI> or <HI>e&s;teem</HI> of it. The former &s;entiment is excit|ed chiefly by the more trivial accompli&s;hments of the man; the latter, only by &s;uch as are important. The qualities, which mo&s;t effectually engage the liking of the generality, are of too low an order to be regarded as being even a-kin to the moral virtues: nay there are &s;ome vices, which, becau&s;e they diffu&s;e a certain ea&s;e, and gaiety, and &s;prightline&s;s over the temper and behaviour, are very apt to obtain the liking even of tho&s;e, in whom a moment of reflection produces abhorrence of their ba&s;ene&s;s. But it is only &s;olid virtue, rooted deep in the temper, and exerted regularly in the conduct, that can ei|ther gain or pre&s;erve the real, inward approbation and e&s;teem of mankind. It likewi&s;e de&s;erves to be remarked, that a man's own turn of character has great influence in determining the objects of his liking, who will be tho&s;e chiefly, who&s;e manners re&s;emble his own; and therefore this &s;entiment will be varia|ble and precarious. Approbation is more permanent and uni|ver&s;al, and le&s;s dependent on the peculiarities of temper; it is often be&s;towed unwillingly by men, on tho&s;e, to whom their own con&s;ciences tell them, to their angui&s;h, that them&s;elves bear no &s;imilitude.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE now, my fathers and brethren, that &s;ome per|&s;on &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, in writing or in conver&s;ation, that our of|fice deprives us of opportunities for acquiring that exterior poli&s;h of manners, which is very acceptable to the generality, and indeed graceful in it&s;elf. This is really the whole amount of &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;uperficial reflexion, which are often thrown out again&s;t us. The author, whom we have principally in our eye, does not expre&s;sly urge this in&s;ignificant accu&s;ation; yet he &s;eems to in&s;inuate, not only that we are obnoxious to it, but al&s;o that it doth detract from the credit of our office: for he mentions good breeding and openne&s;s of behaviour, as one of the amiable qualities, which enter into the character of a &s;oldier, and are naturally derived from his way of life; and he tells us that the character of a clergyman, as well as his way of life, is, in mo&s;t points, oppo&s;ite to that of a &s;oldier.&mdash;
<PB N="12" REF="13">
Need we be much concerned to enquire, whether the charge be true or fal&s;e? If we &s;hould acknowlege it, do you think, that either the importance of our office, or the excellence of our religion, would &s;uffer by the acknowlegement? Nay might not the mini&s;terial character be, neverthele&s;s, agreeable, and fit to procure even the liking of the generality? For might not it contain tho&s;e amiable inward qualities, of which external politene&s;s is only either the expre&s;&s;ion, or the mimick|ry, and from which openne&s;s and ea&s;e of behaviour deriveth all its merit?</P>
<P>SUPPOSE again, that it &s;hould be a&s;&s;erted, that the cha|racter, which naturally re&s;ults from our office, is very gene|rally <HI>di&s;agreeable</HI>; mu&s;t we take it for granted immediately, that this character is <HI>vicious?</HI> May not we rea&s;onably a&s;k, before we admit this conclu&s;ion, to whom, and in what parti|cular manner, it is di&s;agreeable? It is a&s;&s;erted by others, and it is not di&s;&s;embled by our&s;elves, that our office tends to form us to a grave and &s;erious temper, that it di&s;courages the gaiety of plea&s;ure, and unthinking levity of behaviour, that it con|fines us to &s;trict rules of decency, that it leads us to &s;et a guard over our looks and words and actions, and re&s;trains us from giving &s;cope to our natural movements and &s;entiments, when|ever they are either &s;inful or unbecoming.&mdash;I do not know but there are &s;ome particular &s;ea&s;ons, at which the generality would di&s;like a man of this character, and &s;hun his company. But it would be only when they were di&s;po&s;ed to exceed the limits of right and innocence. And could it inferred, from his being di&s;agreeable to them in this &s;ituation, that his cha|racter is vicious, or even that they, who di&s;like him, do not really approve and e&s;teem him notwith&s;tanding? I doubt not but a per&s;on of the character, which we have de&s;cribed, will be, in all &s;ituations, di&s;agreeable to many. He bears no re&s;em|blance, in his manners, to the gay, the di&s;&s;ipated, and the vo|luptuous; and his pre&s;ence would lay them under an unea&s;y re&s;traint. They will always <HI>di&s;like</HI> him: but is it certain,
<PB N="13" REF="14">
that even they will always di&s;approve him? Or if they &s;hould, would it be of mighty con&s;equence? For could he be more agreeable to them, without becoming le&s;s virtuous? Admit, then, that our office naturally produces a turn of character, which is di&s;agreeable in &s;ome re&s;pects: will either the credit of that office, or the excellence of our religion &s;uffer by this charge, if we be able to vindicate our calling from a tendency to form a temper, that is really vicious, or morally evil?</P>
<P>FARTHER, brethren, is it ab&s;olutely certain, that every &s;ort of tendency in the mini&s;terial function, to produce &s;ome real vices in tho&s;e who exerci&s;e it, will nece&s;&s;arily detract from its credit, or be incon&s;i&s;tent with the perfect purity of the go&s;|pel? An a&s;&s;ertion or in&s;inuation of this nature is plau&s;ible in|deed: yet it may be proved, that it ought not to be admitted, but under &s;everal limitations.&mdash;Were it the direct, and pri|mary tendency of our profe&s;&s;ion, to form a vicious character, or to inflame &s;ome heinous vices, this would certainly reflect di&s;honour on it. This would render ours an unlawful calling, becau&s;e we could not exerci&s;e it, without doing what is wrong. Were there, for in&s;tance, any e&s;&s;ential part of our office, which we could not execute, without impo&s;ing <HI>cunningly devi&s;ed fa|bles</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 1. 16.</NOTE> on the credulity of mankind, or fo&s;tering a &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;tition among them, or offering violence to their con&s;ci|ences, our employment would be &s;o far ab&s;olutely immoral. This would al&s;o reflect di&s;honour on our religion; for that re|ligion could not be true, or holy, or divine, which it were im|po&s;&s;ible to teach, without committing &s;in. Let it be clearly proved, that &s;omething unlawful mu&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> be practi&s;ed, in teaching the doctrines, or inculcating the duties of genuine, <HI>uncorrupted chri&s;tianity:</HI>&mdash;by this, indeed, but by nothing le&s;s than this, our office and our religion will be expo&s;ed to cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>IF any per&s;on &s;hould di&s;cover that, tho' our office tend <HI>pri|marily</HI> to form and improve a virtuous character, it has a remote
<PB N="14" REF="15">
and <HI>&s;econdary</HI> tendency to produce vicious di&s;po&s;itions, in tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;t its original impul&s;e; we may give him liberty to a|vail him&s;elf of the di&s;covery, as much as he can with rea&s;on. The amount of the di&s;covery is only this, that the be&s;t things may be abu&s;ed, that what is naturally calculated for the wor|thie&s;t purpo&s;e may be perverted, and, after it is perverted, ren|dered &s;ub&s;ervient to an unworthy and contrary end. This is, indeed, an univer&s;al truth. Rea&s;on is a noble faculty, implan|ted in our nature, on purpo&s;e to enable us to di&s;tingui&s;h truth from fal&s;ehood: but a &s;uperior degree of rea&s;on has been of|ten employed to di&s;gui&s;e plain truths, and to render errors plau&s;ible. Natural affection is an amiable in&s;tinct, de&s;igned to prompt the parent to provide for the helple&s;s infant, and to &s;ubmit to all the fatigues, which may be nece&s;&s;ary for in&s;tilling knowledge and virtue into the opening mind: yet it frequent|ly degenerates into a vicious fondne&s;s, which occa&s;ions the death or prevents the education of the child. The primary end of ingenuous &s;hame and regard to reputation plainly is the prevention of infamous vices: but does not this very princi|ple often lead men to commit one act of wickedne&s;s in order to conceal another, which they have already perpetrated in &s;e|cret? In a word, nothing can have &s;o &s;trong a tendency to pro|mote a good end, but it may be perverted to &s;erve a bad, or even a contrary purpo&s;e. Are we, then, to judge of things, by their primary and e&s;&s;ential tendency, or by that accidental direction, which they acquire when they have been abu&s;ed? By the former, certainly. If it is not &s;ufficient, that the pri|mary tendency of a thing be good, if it is nece&s;&s;ary likewi&s;e, that it be incapable of perver&s;ion or abu&s;e; there will be nothing good or wi&s;e in art or nature; there will be no &s;i|tuation or employment in the world &s;afe or lawful, for there is none, from which men may not take occa&s;ion to fall into vicious conduct. And is it fair or rea&s;onable to in&s;i&s;t, that more is requi&s;ite for the vindication of the pa&s;toral office, than of any thing be&s;ides? Are tho&s;e vices to be charged on the of|fice,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
which &s;pring only from the abu&s;e of it? Are they not ra|ther to be imputed &s;olely to the fault of individuals?</P>
<P>WHEN therefore any per&s;on a&s;&s;erts, that there are circum|&s;tances in the pa&s;toral office, which tend to inflame any parti|cular vice, it is incumbent on him to di&s;tingui&s;h carefully be|tween the primary and the accidental tendency of the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances. If the tendency be but accidental, to urge it to the di&s;advantage of the office, is, either inadvertently or art|fully, to confound things totally di&s;tinct, and thus to render a fal&s;ehood plau&s;ible, or to give a harmle&s;s truth an unfavourable a&s;pect: it is like hurting a man's reputation by an in&s;inuation, which will very probably be mi&s;under&s;tood, and which could do no hurt, except it were mi&s;under&s;tood.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;aid, that there are certain vices, of which mi|ni&s;ters are often guilty, and into which they are led by their profe&s;&s;ion. Suppo&s;e it were alleged, as an in&s;tance of this, that when mini&s;ters are con&s;cious of their wanting &s;ome virtue, which the decorum of their character requires, they are apt to affect the outward appearance of that virtue. Such mini&s;ters are, no doubt guilty of hypocri&s;y. It may be affirmed too, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, that their profe&s;&s;ion is the occa&s;ion of this hypocri|&s;y; becau&s;e their being con&s;cious that their profe&s;&s;ion requires the virtue, which they affect, is their motive in making fal&s;e pretences to it. But is it not plain that, in this ca&s;e, the &s;pi|rit of the office leads them <HI>naturally,</HI> not to <HI>affect</HI> the virtue, but really to <HI>cultivate</HI> it? It can be &s;aid to lead to hypocri&s;y, only by <HI>accident,</HI> by being perverted from its original and proper aim: And its being thus perverted, far from implying that it has an immoral tendency, &s;ets the &s;trength of its ten|dency to virtue in the cleare&s;t light; for it &s;hows, that the mi|ni&s;terial office prompts men &s;o powerfully to the culture of vir|tue, that even they who re&s;i&s;t its impul&s;e, and over whom it has the lea&s;t power, mu&s;t palliate their want of real virtue, to them&s;elves and others, by an hypocritical &s;how of goodne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">
THERE are &s;ome vices, which bear a general re&s;emblance to certain virtues: &s;uper&s;tition, for in&s;tance, mimics piety; ran|cour calls it&s;elf zeal; moro&s;ene&s;s would pa&s;s for a &s;erious tem|per. Men of all profe&s;&s;ions often indulge the vice, while they flatter them&s;elves that they are cultivating the virtue, for which it is mi&s;taken. We impute it to their weakne&s;s, and pity their want of true moral di&s;cernment. Suppo&s;e that a clergyman &s;hould in like manner, &s;ub&s;titute &s;ome &s;pecious vice in the place of a particular virtue, which eminently &s;uits the genius of his profe&s;&s;ion: ought we to impute this vice to the pro|fe&s;&s;ion? Mu&s;t not we, on the contrary, impute it wholly to the infirmity of the individual, and to the general deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in? If this can account for &s;imilar in&s;tances among other ranks of men, with what colour of rea&s;on can we urge the vice, as a proof of an immoral tendency in the mini&s;terial calling?</P>
<P>THERE are certain ends naturally de&s;irable to mankind, in whatever &s;tation they be placed. Every &s;tation furni&s;hes a man with <HI>lawful</HI> means of promoting the&s;e ends; but in every &s;tation, a man has it likewi&s;e in his power to pur&s;ue them by <HI>unlawful</HI> means.&mdash;Be&s;ides tho&s;e ends, which we may <HI>innocently</HI> aim at, there are others, which it is <HI>wrong</HI> to pur|&s;ue, but which the corrupt affections of mankind will often lead them to pur&s;ue; and different wrong ends will be mo&s;t likely to attract different cla&s;&s;es of men.&mdash;In the pre|&s;ent degenerate &s;tate of mankind, many will pur&s;ue unlawful ends, or &s;eek to promote &s;uch ends as are lawful in them&s;elves, by unju&s;tifiable means. They have the vicious bent, which occa&s;ions this, independent of their particular profe&s;&s;ion; but it determines the form, which the vice a&s;&s;umes. It is in this way that every &s;tation and profe&s;&s;ion has it peculiar temptati|ons, and expo&s;es tho&s;e, who occupy it, to peculiar dangers.&mdash;Now &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;tation, in which mini&s;ters are placed, has, in like manner, its peculiar temptations; that mini&s;ters may find in their employment unlawful means of attaining a lawful end, or that they may render their &s;acred functions &s;ub|&s;ervient
<PB N="17" REF="18">
to a wrong end: is this any more than happens in o|ther profe&s;&s;ions? If this can expo&s;e the mini&s;try to cen&s;ure, mu&s;t it not equally expo&s;e every other occupation? Can it, then, be fairly urged to the di&s;advantage of this one office, in compari&s;on with others? If this tendency to vice be but &s;e|condary and accidental in other callings, mu&s;t it not be e&s;teem|ed &s;uch al&s;o in our vocation? If, in other employments, the fault be chargeable only on the individuals, who are guilty, pray, why &s;hould not individual clergymen likewi&s;e be alone an&s;werable for yielding to the temptations, which ari&s;e from their peculiar bu&s;ine&s;s?&mdash;The office of a clergyman is found|ed in the go&s;pel: but can the go&s;pel be blamed, becau&s;e this office has its peculiar temptations? Before you determine that it can, &s;top for a moment, and ob&s;erve the con&s;equences. O|ther &s;tations are appointed in the cour&s;e of ordinary provi|dence; and their peculiar temptations would reflect the &s;ame di&s;honour upon it. If the common temptations of life be not &s;ufficient to overturn the belief of a God and a providence, tho&s;e, which are peculiar to the pa&s;toral office, cannot affect the truth or the excellence of the go&s;pel. Let none therefore throw blame on the chri&s;tian mini&s;try, on account of its &s;up|plying &s;ome temptations to vice, or on the go&s;pel, becau&s;e it has e&s;tabli&s;hed an office, which is liable to abu&s;e, but tho&s;e who have already embraced athei&s;m, and denied the con&s;titu|tion of the world to be wi&s;e and good.&mdash;Mankind are at pre|&s;ent, by the univer&s;al appointment of God, in a &s;tate of trial and exerci&s;e. There is no circum&s;tance in life, but gives us opportunities of acting either virtuou&s;ly or viciou&s;ly. It is on|ly by putting it in our power to act viciou&s;ly, if we choo&s;e, that any &s;ituation can exerci&s;e or improve our virtuous affecti|ons. Exerci&s;e is afforded to our temper, not only by the ge|neral circum&s;tances of life, common to all men, but likewi&s;e by the peculiar circum&s;tances of particular profe&s;&s;ions. There are peculiar circum&s;tances in the mini&s;terial office, as well as in every other, which may give exerci&s;e to our virtues, and im|prove them, but may likewi&s;e, as is indeed a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence, prove occa&s;ions of vice. To a&s;&s;ert this is only to &s;ay,
<PB N="18" REF="19">
that mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are in a &s;tate of probation and di&s;|cipline, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as other men, that their employment, as well as other employments, contains circum&s;tances fit to draw out virtuous principles, and to give them exerci&s;e: and this &s;urely can derogate nothing from the excellence of their office.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e that the vices of a wicked mini&s;ter ri&s;e high|er, in particular in&s;tances, and become more atrocious than tho&s;e of others: this is &s;o far from nece&s;&s;arily implying an im|moral tendency in his office, that, on the contrary, it may re|ally proceed from the &s;trength of its virtuous tendency; for the greater the advantage, which this office affords for virtu|ous practice, the greater will be the depravity nece&s;&s;ary for a|bu&s;ing them, and the more heinous and inveterate the corrup|tion, which will &s;pring from the abu&s;e.&mdash;As the &s;ame vicious principle may a&s;&s;ume different forms, and be exerted in diffe|rent ways, &s;ome forms and exertions of it are often more de|te&s;tible and pernicious than others. If, then, &s;ome vicious principle &s;hould a&s;&s;ume its blacke&s;t form, in the practice of a clergyman, who fo&s;ters it; and if it &s;hould appear to be deter|mined to that form, by the circum&s;tances of his occupation; can we arraign the &s;pirit of his office on this account? This were to judge of that office only by the abu&s;e of it. But do not all men admit it for a maxim, that tho&s;e things are gene|rally the be&s;t in them&s;elves, the corruption of which is the wor&s;t?</P>
<P>SUPPOSE again, that the employment of a mini&s;ter con|tains circum&s;tances, which will lead to vicious conduct, if the greate&s;t caution be not exerci&s;ed: this would not nece&s;&s;arily prove even that vice will be more common among mini&s;ters than among other ranks of men; much le&s;s would it prove, that the &s;pirit of the office is, on the whole, friendly to vice; for it may contain other circum&s;tances, which prompt &s;trongly
<PB N="19" REF="20">
to exert the nece&s;&s;ary caution, to re&s;i&s;t the importunities of vice, and to cultivate every virtue. The mini&s;terial office may, from its being abu&s;ed and perverted, by the weakne&s;s or cor|ruption of tho&s;e who exerci&s;e it, or from various circum&s;tances in this &s;tate of probation, in which it is to be executed, &s;up|ply temptations, which have a direct and powerful tendency to excite a pa&s;&s;ion or inclination, who&s;e indulgence will lead the negligent into vicious conduct. If this could throw a re|flexion on the &s;pirit of that office, or on the chri&s;tian religion, which has in&s;tituted it, how could we vindicate the ordinary &s;ituations, in which God places us, or the general plan of his. providence towards us in the pre&s;ent world? Many objects in nature excite pa&s;&s;ions, which crave gratification often when it is vicious to gratify them. Were man formed for following thoughtle&s;sly the pre&s;ent inclination, the&s;e objects would infal|libly lead him into vice. But we mu&s;t take the whole of hu|man nature into the account; man is endued with a moral principle, a principle of reflection, who&s;e proper bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to re&s;train inclination, whenever it cannot be indulged lawful|ly. His &s;tate is &s;uited to his whole nature. The temptati|ons of life are de&s;igned to give him opportunities of exerting reflection, of acting with moral attention to his conduct, and are fit to &s;trengthen, by this means, the principle of reflection, and improve a habit of &s;elf-government, which is the great &s;ecurity of virtue. They who will not exerci&s;e reflection, and employ care, in controuling their inclinations, fall before temptations, thro' their own fault, are hardened in vice by means of them, and thus render them &s;ub&s;ervient to a con|trary end, from that which God has de&s;igned and fitted them to an&s;wer. This is the general con&s;titution of the world, yet the Creator is wi&s;e, and good, and perfect. The office of a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter, in like manner, &s;upplies temptations, with which many comply, and which it requires a great de|gree of care and attention to re&s;i&s;t; yet that office may be de&s;igned for the virtuous improvement of tho&s;e who occupy it, its &s;pirit may tend &s;trongly to promote that improvement;
<PB N="20" REF="21">
and the religion, which in&s;titutes that office, may be holy and divine, for it is indeed analogous to the whole plan of providence.</P>
<P>I WILL make one &s;uppo&s;ition more, and that as favou|rable to our adver&s;aries as they can rea&s;onably de&s;ire. I will &s;uppo&s;e that the office of a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter expo&s;es him to greater danger of acting viciou&s;ly than other men. Even this &s;uppo&s;ition will not avail them much. In this ca&s;e our &s;tation would indeed be hazardous to our&s;elves: as a few &s;oldiers are &s;ometimes forced to defend a de&s;perate po&s;t, in order to pre&s;erve a whole army from de&s;truction, &s;o we &s;hould be expo|&s;ed to an imminent danger of lo&s;ing our own &s;ouls, in promot|ing the &s;alvation of others. But even this would not prove, that our office has an immoral tendency, in any &s;en&s;e, which could affect the credit of our religion. It would be only ana|logous to what happens in the cour&s;e of nature, that &s;ome &s;i|tuations &s;upply &s;tronger and more numerous temptations than others; and therefore it could never prove, that the go&s;pel is not derived from the author of nature.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations appeared to be nece&s;&s;ary for remov|ing the confu&s;ion, in which the charge again&s;t the &s;pirit of our profe&s;&s;ion has been commonly involved, and for enabling us to detect &s;ome of the artifices, by which it has been rendered plau&s;ible, and &s;eemingly important. The &s;um is this. If the enemies of our order only prove, that our office tends to form a character, in which &s;ome agreeable qualities are wanting, or even a character po&s;itively di&s;agreeable in &s;ome re&s;pects; or if they prove, that &s;ome circum&s;tances in it may be perverted into occa&s;ions of vice, or that it pre&s;ents peculiar temptations, which it will require great caution to avoid complying with, they allege nothing, which can ju&s;tly affect either the &s;pirit of our office, or the religion, by which it is e&s;tabli&s;hed. If they can prove no more, they attack us with in&s;ufficient weapons; we may expo&s;e our bo&s;oms to their pointle&s;s arrows, without receiving the &s;lighte&s;t hurt. They &s;how their inclination to an|noy

us; and the undi&s;cerning and the prejudiced may take it for granted, that they have given a mortal wound to religion and its mini&s;ters. But the candid and the con&s;iderate will &s;oon perceive that, in order to accompli&s;h their de&s;ign, they mu&s;t evince, that the <HI>original</HI> and <HI>prevailing</HI> tendency of our office is immoral, that &s;omething vicious is nece&s;&s;ary in order to pro|mote its genuine end, and to di&s;charge its real duties. To di&s;|cover whether this has ever been evinced, or can indeed be e|vinced, is the intention of the &s;equel.</P>
<P N="2">II. WITH this view we propo&s;ed, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> to enquire, whether that character, which the mini&s;terial office tends to form, be virtuous or vicious on the whole.</P>
<P>OUR office is charged expre&s;sly, only with &s;ome particu|lar vices: but the&s;e are &s;o heinous and &s;o numerous, and &s;of|tened by the mixture of &s;o few virtues, that, were the charge &s;upported with &s;ufficient evidence, it would imply, that the na|tural character of a clergyman is, upon the whole vicious and dete&s;tible. I doubt not however but it will appear, by every kind of evidence, of which the &s;ubject can be &s;uppo&s;ed capa|ble, that a character, in all re&s;pects virtuous, is the natural re|&s;ult of our profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>MAY it not be a&s;&s;erted, in the fir&s;t place, with con&s;idera|ble evidence, that the clergy in general are, in fact, equal, nay, &s;uperior to other cla&s;&s;es of men, in whatever de&s;erves the name of moral virtue? And if this be true, will it not form an argument in favour of the genius of our calling? For if it real|ly led to vice, it could &s;carce fail to corrupt the greater num|ber. It is not ea&s;y to prove beyond di&s;pute, what depends upon &s;o many in&s;tances, what requires the ob&s;ervation of many ages and nations; nor is it po&s;&s;ible, on this occa&s;ion, to enter on a long detail from hi&s;tory, to &s;upport the a&s;&s;ertion: but let a|ny per&s;on examine with impartiality, and he will find that, in every &s;tate of things, mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel have had their full proportion of the virtue of the times. In the be&s;t and the mo&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="23">
virtuous ages, there have been more of this order eminent for virtue, in proportion to the number of tho&s;e who belong to it, than of any other. In the mo&s;t degenerate times, in times when religion has been mo&s;t perverted from its true de&s;ign, the morals of the clergy have been higher than on a level with tho&s;e of the laity. If there be any period, in which it has been otherwi&s;e, let our adver&s;aries point it out.&mdash;We own they have great advantages on their &s;ide.&mdash;The mini&s;terial of|fice leads to privacy and retreat; the abu&s;es of it often carry a man into public life. On this account, the vices of tho&s;e clergymen, who have departed from the genius of their office, are con&s;picuous, and liable to be expo&s;ed by the torch of hi&s;|tory: but they, who have been &s;teddily actuated by its genu|ine &s;pirit, have pa&s;&s;ed thro life in virtuous ob&s;curity, revered by tho&s;e who knew them, their memory honoured for a gene|ration or two, but totally unregarded by hi&s;tory, which con|fines it&s;elf to the actions of the higher ranks of men, or to tho&s;e actions, which had an influence on the revolutions of go|vernment, or on the general &s;tate of civil affairs.&mdash;It will like|wi&s;e de&s;erve attention, that in &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hments of religion, many clergymen have not been confined to the proper functi|ons of their office, but have devoted them&s;elves chiefly to &s;e|cular affairs, perfectly foreign to it. It is not in the&s;e, that we can expect to find the genuine character of the order; for the pa&s;toral office cannot po&s;&s;ibly exert its influence on a man, who is &s;carce at all employed in the duties of it. The temper of &s;uch a per&s;on mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be formed, principally by tho&s;e &s;ecular occupations, in which he is mo&s;t conver&s;ant. Yet it is from clergymen in this &s;ituation, that per&s;ons are readie&s;t to take their idea of the whole body; becau&s;e they are mo&s;t ex|po&s;ed to ob&s;ervation.&mdash;Our adver&s;aries derive another ad|vantage from the unequal manner, in which the comparative importance of different virtues and vices is ordinarily e&s;timat|ed. Temperance, piety, and the other virtues, which will na|turally predominate in the character of a clergyman, are depre&s;|&s;ed far below their genuine dignity; and at the &s;ame time ma|ny vices, frequent among the other ranks of men, but rarely to
<PB N="23" REF="24">
be found among the clergy, are regarded with a more favour|able eye than their real deformity de&s;erves. This perver&s;ion of moral &s;entiment, if it be not guarded again&s;t, will nece&s;&s;arily dimini&s;h the merit of the clergyman, and rai&s;e that of the man of the world, and thus di&s;gui&s;e their true proportion to each other.&mdash;But let our adver&s;aries take no more advantage from the&s;e or other circum&s;tances, than them&s;elves can approve as fair; let them examine what has been the real character of the clergy, not by &s;electing a few in&s;tances on one &s;ide only, but by making a complete and impartial induction; let them make the &s;ame allowance in this ca&s;e, that they would reckon rea&s;on|able in other ca&s;es; let them form their judgment chiefly from tho&s;e clergymen, who have been employed only in the proper duties of their calling; at lea&s;t let them di&s;tingui&s;h, in others, between the vices, which belong to them as clergymen, and tho&s;e, which have &s;prung from their adventitious occupations; let the &s;everal virtues, and their oppo&s;ite vices be valued, I will not &s;ay, according to the chri&s;tian &s;tandard, but accord|ing to that &s;tandard, which the unperverted &s;entiments of man|kind have fixed, and the be&s;t heathen morali&s;ts have acknow|leged; let them tell us hone&s;tly the re&s;ult of their enquiry. If they &s;hould find, that mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel have been, up|on the whole, more blamele&s;s, more virtuous than the re&s;t of mankind, that they have for the mo&s;t part, fallen in late&s;t with a prevailing corruption of manners, that they have often op|po&s;ed its progre&s;s, and been lea&s;t infected with it, that &s;ome|times the majority of them have totally e&s;caped the contagion of vice, which raged among other ranks; they cannot deny that the mini&s;terial office has a &s;trong tendency to promote the practice of univer&s;al virtue.</P>
<P>THAT the re&s;ult of their enquiry will be what we have &s;uppo&s;ed, I pronounce with the greater confidence, becau&s;e it &s;eems to be really acknowleged by all mankind. It is an un|deniable matter of fact, that the general &s;en&s;e of mankind pro|claims vice to be peculiarly &s;candalous, and virtue to be pecu|liarly
<PB N="24" REF="25">
requi&s;ite in a clergyman. They, who pay little regard to the laws of morality in their own conduct, demand the mo&s;t &s;potle&s;s virtue in the teachers of religion. Every deviation from &s;trict virtue, every in&s;tance of vice in men of this profe&s;&s;ion, has always excited greater and more general indignation, than &s;imilar faults in others. Whence does this univer&s;al &s;entiment ari&s;e? It can ari&s;e from no cau&s;e, which is not obvious to the very &s;en&s;es of mankind; for circum&s;tances, which cannot be di&s;covered without clo&s;e attention and deep penetration, will never affect the generality: their &s;entiments and judgments are produced only by plain matters of fact. And from what cau&s;e can their &s;entiment on this &s;ubject ari&s;e, but actual experience of the &s;uperior virtue of chri&s;tian mini&s;ters? Familiar objects never &s;trike us &s;trongly. Vices, which we are accu&s;tomed to witne&s;s, we &s;oon learn to behold without a great degree of horror. Were a vicious mini&s;ter very common, men mu&s;t have long ago regarded him with as little indignation as other vi|cious men. They are peculiarly &s;hocked with vice in a cler|gyman, for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e they do not find it &s;o frequent|ly in men of this character as in others.</P>
<P>BUT this &s;entiment of the peculiar un&s;uitablene&s;s of vice to the profe&s;&s;ion of a clergyman de&s;erves to be con&s;idered far|ther; for not only do mankind, by means of it, give te&s;timo|ny that virtue is more general among mini&s;ters than among o|thers, but it likewi&s;e contains a <HI>direct</HI> proof, that the genius of our calling is eminently favourable to virtue. It &s;uppo&s;es that all the world is &s;en&s;ible, that mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel have, from the very nature of their office, peculiar advantages for being virtuous. If this were not taken for granted, men could never deem vice peculiarly atrocious in a clergyman, they could never exact uniform virtue more rigorou&s;ly from him than from any other per&s;on. When the &s;ituation, in which a man is pla|ced, lays him under &s;trong temptations to vice, we make al|lowance for it, in our cen&s;ure of him. We excu&s;e, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the &s;allies of youth, becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions are violent at that time of life. We give &s;ome indulgence to the peevi&s;h|ne&s;s
<PB N="25" REF="26">
of old age, becau&s;e the infirmities incident to that period are powerful temptations to ill humour. We pity, rather than blame a wretch, who, overcome by torture, betrays his friend. The judgment is natural, nece&s;&s;ary, and well founded. The vices, on which we are di&s;po&s;ed to pa&s;s a heavy cen&s;ure, are tho&s;e, which a man commits without any inducement from his &s;ituation, tho&s;e, which he is under a &s;trong obligation to avoid, and has great advantages for avoiding. When all men, there|fore, perceive vice to be incongruous to the character of a cler|gyman, is not this a confe&s;&s;ion, that his &s;acred function has a pe|culiar fitne&s;s for forming him to virtue? Believers and infidels agree in the &s;entiments, on which our argument is founded, and therefore mu&s;t equally perceive its force. The natural &s;entiments even of tho&s;e, who are mo&s;t forward to cen&s;ure the &s;pirit of our office, pronounce vice peculiarly odious, and vir|tue peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary in a clergyman; and the&s;e &s;entiments; ari&s;ing &s;pontaneou&s;ly and irre&s;i&s;tibly in their hearts, are a much &s;tronger proof of their being con&s;cious of the moral tendency of the chri&s;tian mini&s;try, than any refined arguments, formed at lei&s;ure, can be of the contrary. Let them either acknow|ledge, that our office urges us powerfully to all virtue, of let them regard tho&s;e vices, which they charge upon it, as more venial and excu&s;able, as le&s;s worthy of di&s;approbation in a clergyman, than in another.</P>
<P>BEFORE I leave this topic, allow me to make one ob&s;er|vation, which &s;eems to be of importance in e&s;timating the re|al character of a clergyman. It is the judgment of human na|ture, that every vice has a &s;ingular atrocity in him; this judg|ment could not be formed, except vice were comparatively rare in that profe&s;&s;ion, and likewi&s;e ab&s;olutely repugnant to its genuine &s;pirit; yet this very judgment has contributed not a little to be&s;tow plau&s;ibility on the a&s;&s;ertion, that the &s;pirit of our profe&s;&s;ion is immoral, an a&s;&s;ertion, to which it is altogether contradictory. The con&s;equence of this judgment has been that, while very <HI>high degrees</HI> of vice are overlooked in other men, or, at mo&s;t, are &s;lightly blamed, the <HI>lea&s;t appearance</HI> of e|very
<PB N="26" REF="27">
vice in a clergyman is immediately remarked and &s;evere|ly condemned. By this means, a few &s;mall vices in him appear both greater and more numerous, than many atrocious vices in another, becau&s;e they are more certainly ob&s;erved and more heavily cen&s;ured. A per&s;on is highly di&s;approved, when he bears the character of a clergyman, who would have been noways cen&s;ured, if he had belonged to any other order. Thus the very tendency of the mini&s;terial office to promote virtue has led men, fir&s;t to think mini&s;ters more vicious, in compari|&s;on with others, than they really are, and next, in con&s;equence of this, to charge the office it&s;elf with a tendency to vice. We own, that mankind do us no inju&s;tice in reckoning vice more heinous in us, than in others; but the judgment &s;uppo&s;es the &s;pirit of our office to be eminently favourable to virtue; and therefore a per&s;on cannot fairly avail him&s;elf of it, who denies this, and is examining the real characters of clergymen, in or|der to determine, whether the &s;pirit of their office be moral or immoral; he ought to e&s;timate <HI>their</HI> actions only by that &s;tan|dard, which he applies to the actions of <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER, it is worth while to ob&s;erve, that they who cen&s;ure the &s;pirit of our profe&s;&s;ion mo&s;t &s;everely, acknowlege its tendency to be moral in one re&s;pect. There is one virtue, &s;trict decency and temperance, which they own that we natu|rally derive from our employment. They in&s;inuate, indeed, that it is the only one. But if it be evident, that this one vir|tue nece&s;&s;arily promotes other virtues, and gives us advanta|ges for cultivating them, it cannot be denied that our calling, by its immediate influence on this one, will indirectly, but re|ally tend to form the other parts of a virtuous temper.&mdash;Decency and temperance implies, at lea&s;t, &s;trict ab&s;tinence from all the exce&s;&s;es of plea&s;ure, from the di&s;&s;ipation of gay and thoughtle&s;s mirth, and from all tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of any of our pa&s;&s;ions, which are unbecoming. In con&s;equence of this ab&s;tinence, the &s;en&s;ual appetites and infer or pa&s;&s;ions, which are always vicious, when they become exce&s;&s;ive, and which in others are apt to become exce&s;&s;ive, by being indulg|ed
<PB N="27" REF="28">
without controul, will, almo&s;t unavoidably, be pre&s;erved weak and moderate in a clergyman. This is one important ingredient in a virtuous character.&mdash;But this is not all. They, who are di&s;po&s;ed to regard intemperance and levity with the mo&s;t favourable eye, can &s;carce deny, that they often prove occa&s;ions of leading men into vices much more heinous. There is no crime &s;o atrocious, but a man brutified by exce&s;s, or di&s;|&s;ipated by giddine&s;s may occa&s;ionally perpetrate. The ba&s;e&s;t cour&s;es have been taken, in order to procure gratification to pampered appetites. The frequent returns of levity and in|temperance may produce repeated acts of any vice, and the&s;e repeated acts will, by degrees, render the wor&s;t di&s;po&s;itions habitual. Our office, therefore, by confining us to &s;trict rules of decency, pre&s;erves us from a &s;ituation, which would put us in imminent hazard of committing many acts of vice, and of contracting many evil habits. By this means, it has a peculi|ar tendency to produce a general purity of heart, which un|doubtedly confers very con&s;iderable worth upon the character.&mdash;A &s;trict regard to decency will likewi&s;e influence our temper in another way. It implies a con&s;tant re&s;traint of vicious prin|ciples, concern that our conduct be right and unblameable, and regard to the authority and dictates of the moral faculty. Now there is a natural a&s;&s;ociation among our principles of ac|tion, by means of which any one of them prepares the mind for receiving any other, that has the &s;ame direction. On this account, a regard to decency mu&s;t have a tendency to intro|duce into the &s;oul, ju&s;tice, veracity, humility, meekne&s;s, pati|ence, forbearance, and, in a word, all the virtues, which, like it&s;elf, hold of controul, and are included in the idea of &s;elf-go|vernment. The direct principle of all the&s;e is the &s;ame with that of decency, a &s;en&s;e of duty, a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the law of con|&s;cience. As every principle is &s;trengthened by being habitu|ally exerted, the authority of con&s;cience will be confirmed by our regard to decency; it will be enabled to controul every wrong affection with greater ea&s;e; and, by being accu&s;tomed to &s;ubmit to its government in one in&s;tance, we &s;hall be better
<PB N="28" REF="29">
di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmit to it in all. Indeed men are often &s;urpri&s;ing|ly ab&s;urd and incon&s;i&s;tent in their conduct; one pa&s;&s;ion may be perfectly ungoverned, while another is re&s;trained. On this account, we cannot affirm, that a regard to decency will <HI>nece&s;|&s;arily</HI> produce all the virtues of &s;elf-government: but it cer|tainly <HI>tends</HI> to have a favourable influence upon them: and our office, by almo&s;t <HI>certainly</HI> producing that, will <HI>probably</HI> pro|mote the&s;e others.&mdash;The principal ob&s;truction to the preva|lence of good affections ari&s;es from the &s;trength of &s;ome vici|ous pa&s;&s;ions, which oppo&s;e their exerci&s;e. A regard to decen|cy, by contributing <HI>directly</HI> to weaken the&s;e vicious pa&s;&s;ions, will lay the mind open to the influence of worthy affections, and will thus give us great advantages for acquiring all tho&s;e amiable virtues, which con&s;i&s;t in the exerci&s;e of them.&mdash;If, therefore, &s;trict decency and temperance re&s;ult naturally from our profe&s;&s;ion, it mu&s;t have, at lea&s;t, an indirect tendency to promote all other virtues. The conce&s;&s;ions of our adver&s;aries, however &s;mall they may appear, imply that our profe&s;&s;ion has a real tendency to promote univer&s;al virtue.</P>
<P>THESE general arguments, drawn from the real charac|ters of the generality of clergymen; from the natural judg|ment of mankind, that virtue is peculiarly incumbent on them; and from the influence of that partial virtue, which is allowed by all to re&s;ult naturally from our profe&s;&s;ion, appeared too im|portant to be wholly omitted, becau&s;e they not only are con|clu&s;ive in them&s;elves, but al&s;o throw con&s;iderable light on the whole of this &s;ubject.&mdash;But the mo&s;t direct proof of the tendency of our office, to form us to a temper of univer&s;al vir|tue, &s;till remains. It ari&s;es from the nature of that office.</P>
<P>As moral cau&s;es have doubtle&s;s a very great influence on the characters of men, &s;o all profe&s;&s;ions, it is allowed, contain fixt moral principles, which tend to produce a corre&s;pondent character, and have often force enough to alter the di&s;po&s;ition, that was received from nature. Now we may learn with cer|tainty, the tendency of the moral principles, e&s;&s;ential to any
<PB N="29" REF="30">
profe&s;&s;ion, by examining the nature of that profe&s;&s;ion, its end, and the proper means of promoting that end. If we &s;urvey the mini&s;terial office in this manner, we &s;hall find, that it has an e&s;&s;ential tendency to promote a virtuous temper.</P>
<P>THE bu&s;ine&s;s of a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel is, in brief, to teach religion. The tendency of his office will, therefore, be altogether determined by the nature of the religion, which he teaches. Chri&s;tianity includes all the principles of natural re|ligion, and &s;uperadds the revelation of a &s;tupendous di&s;pen&s;a|tion of providence, for the redemption and reformation of an apo&s;tate world, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The truths of natural theo|logy, e&s;pecially as they are illu&s;trated and refined in &s;cripture, center in this, that to <HI>fear God, and keep his commandments is the whole of man</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. xii. 13.</NOTE>. The peculiar doctrines of revelation <HI>teach us, that denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 12.</NOTE>. Both are propo&s;ed in the &s;crip|tures, the only rule of our teaching, with an expre&s;s de&s;ign to form us to the love of God and of man, to make us <HI>perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed unto all good works</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 17.</NOTE>. Religious princi|ples are con&s;tantly repre&s;ented as arguments for all virtue, and addre&s;&s;ed to our hopes, to our fears, to our gratitude, to our honour, to our propen&s;ity to imitation, to every affection of the human heart, that can have any influence on conduct. At the &s;ame time, in the &s;criptures, all the parts of virtue, all the duties of life are illu&s;trated in the ju&s;te&s;t, and the mo&s;t practi|cal manner. Our employment is, to promote the belief and the practice of this religion; to recommend goodne&s;s, by pu|bli&s;hing truth; to explain virtue, and enforce it by all po&s;&s;ible motives. Can &s;uch employment tend to form us to any other temper, than that virtue, which we inculcate upon others?</P>
<P>IT is certainly fir&s;t of all requi&s;ite in a teacher, that he un|der&s;tand the &s;ubject of his teaching, and that, for this purpo&s;e, he &s;tudy it with care. Our profe&s;&s;ion will, therefore, naturally
<PB N="30" REF="31">
lead us to the diligent and con&s;tant &s;tudy of all the doctrines and duties of religion; it will urge us to <HI>know the holy &s;criptures</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">ver. 15.</NOTE>, to <HI>meditate upon them,</HI> to <HI>give our&s;elves wholly to them</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1. Tim. iv. 15.</NOTE>, that we may be <HI>able to teach others</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">2. Tim. ii. 2.</NOTE>. If, then, religious or moral con&s;iderations, if precepts, or arguments, if maxims, or &s;entiments, examples, or rules of virtue have really <HI>any</HI> force, they mu&s;t exert it <HI>mo&s;t</HI> in purifying, refining, and exalting the tempers of tho&s;e, who&s;e whole bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to attend to them. Since mini&s;ters mu&s;t often think on all the&s;e, that they may un|der&s;tand them, and that they may inculcate them upon others; the con&s;equence will be, that, if they are, like other men, &s;ub|ject to the law of habit, incitements to virtue will occur to their thoughts more ea&s;ily and frequently, than to the thoughts of others, and urge them more powerfully to a &s;uitable behavi|our.</P>
<P>A GREAT part of the vice, with which other men are infected, ari&s;es from the temptations, to which they are expo&s;|ed in the cour&s;e of their worldly bu&s;ine&s;s. Each of them has a temporal vocation, the direct end of which does not coin|cide with that of their &s;piritual calling, and which therefore &s;ometimes leads them off from the duties of the latter. But mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel have no worldly bu&s;ine&s;s: the nature of their office, as well as the authority of &s;cripture, to which they are indi&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to &s;ubmit, forbids them to <HI>entan|gle</HI> them&s;elves <HI>with the affairs of this life</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 4.</NOTE>; and, by con&s;e|quence, pre&s;erves them, while they continue in their proper province, from tho&s;e temptations, which produce the greate&s;t part of the wickedne&s;s of the world. Our occupation is, to en|force a &s;en&s;e of virtue and religion upon others; and every attempt of this kind is an act of virtue, which tends directly to our own improvement. Every effort, which we make in our <HI>particular</HI> vocation, promotes the end of our <HI>general</HI> calling.</P>

OUR office leads us to ob&s;erve our fellow-creatures in all tho&s;e &s;ituations, in which either virtuous principles, or the &s;en&s;e of vice produce the mo&s;t con&s;picuous effects, and tend mo&s;t &s;trongly to alarm a &s;pectator, and to force him to attend to the oppo&s;ite natures of good and evil.

<P>TO enumerate all the peculiar inducements, which the mi|ni&s;ters of Je&s;us have to pure and exalted virtue, were indeed to explain all the circum&s;tances of the pa&s;toral office. From the few ob&s;ervations, which we have made already, it appears evident, that that office tends to promote virtue, in tho&s;e who exerci&s;e it, by many moral cau&s;es e&s;&s;ential to it, and fit to work on the mo&s;t univer&s;al and unque&s;tionable principles of human nature.</P>
<P>BUT tho' our office has plainly an e&s;&s;ential and unalterable tendency to purify and refine the heart, yet we will acknow|lege,&mdash;
<PB N="34" REF="35">
we reckon our&s;elves noways concerned to di&s;&s;emble it,&mdash;it highly imports us to con&s;ider it very often,&mdash;that our pro|fe&s;&s;ion will not form us infallibly to virtue; nay that, if we al|low it to fail of producing this its primary and mo&s;t natural ef|fect, the very circum&s;tances, which give us &s;o many advanta|ges for virtue, will render us more deeply and more ob&s;tinate|ly wicked than the re&s;t of mankind.&mdash;By the original con|&s;titution of our nature, habit, which &s;trengthens our <HI>active</HI> prin|ciples, weakens all <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> impre&s;&s;ions. The more frequently that we con&s;ider or feel motives to virtue, without being really excited to the practice of virtue, the feebler will be their influ|ence upon us, the greater our in&s;en&s;ibility, the more imminent our danger of never yielding to their force. This is an alarm|ing truth to all human creatures, but to mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel more alarming than to others. We mu&s;t revolve and preach the truths and duties of religion &s;o frequently, that if they do not influence us early to &s;incere and &s;tedfa&s;t virtue, they mu&s;t quickly become familiar and lo&s;e their power. Moral and divine con&s;iderations mu&s;t pa&s;s &s;o continually tnro' our minds, that in a very &s;hort time they will make no impre&s;&s;ion on us. A per|&s;on whom our profe&s;&s;ion does not render virtuous, will become more &s;uddenly and more de&s;perately obdurate in wickedne&s;s, than any other man.&mdash;Nothing contributes more to &s;trength|en any principle, than an oppo&s;ition, which doth not effectu|ally re&s;train it. Our profe&s;&s;ion contains the mo&s;t powerful in|ducements to virtue; the&s;e will, at lea&s;t, make a vigorous <HI>op|po&s;ition</HI> to all vicious principles of action; but if the oppo&s;i|tion do not &s;ubdue them, they will collect all their force in or|der to &s;urmount it, and they will be &s;trengthened and confirm|ed by the violent effort. As a &s;luice, which cannot &s;tem a tor|rent altogether, only renders the inundation greater, and greater &s;till the longer it keeps it back; ju&s;t &s;o vicious pa&s;&s;ions, which are too violent to be wholly re&s;trained by the fen es, which our profe&s;&s;ion rai&s;es again&s;t them, will produce the mo&s;t dreadful deluge of wickedne&s;s, whenever their fury can b eak down the&s;e &s;ences. If a pa&s;tor be really vicious, he will, almo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
<PB N="35" REF="36">
be &s;ingularly vicious. Nothing le&s;s than a total de|pravation of &s;oul can be the effect of a man's re&s;i&s;ting the &s;trict obligations to virtue, and abu&s;ing the &s;ignal advantages for cultivating it, which the pa&s;toral office affords.&mdash;In the&s;e and, perhaps, in &s;ome other ways, our office may heighten vice in tho&s;e, who refu&s;e to be actuated by its genuine &s;pirit. But this conce&s;&s;ion will avail our antagoni&s;ts nothing. Were this a &s;ufficient proof, that our office tends naturally to vice, it would likewi&s;e be a proof, that all con&s;ideration of our du|ty, or of arguments for the practice of it has a natural tendency to render us vicious; for it is certain, that the oftener any man reflects on his duty, and the &s;tronger his &s;en&s;e of its ob|ligation is, if he be not really excited to the practice of it, the le&s;s chance there is of his ever practi&s;ing it, the more harden|ed in vice he will become in time, and the more impetuou&s;ly ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions will rage within him.</P>
<P>BOTH from the former arguments, and from the &s;urvey that we have taken of the nature of our office, it is plain, that it tends primarily and mo&s;t naturally to virtue. It promotes, not one virtue, but a temper, which di&s;po&s;es the mind to the culture of every virtue. It is the abu&s;e of it that leads to vice; and the abu&s;e leads &s;o &s;trongly to vice, only becau&s;e the office it&s;elf has a powerful influence on virtue. If this <HI>general</HI> examination of the genius of our calling be not <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for vindicating it from the a&s;per&s;ions of our adver&s;aries, it is not|with&s;tanding highly <HI>proper</HI> for producing in our&s;elves, my re|verend fathers and brethren, a &s;en&s;e of the &s;trength of tho&s;e obligations to virtue which we ly under.</P>
<P N="3">III. WE will now enquire, <HI>thirdly,</HI> how far our office has really a tendency to produce or to inflame tho&s;e particular vices, which &s;ome have repre&s;ented as characteri&s;tical of our order.</P>
<P>THIS is the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the late author, to whom we have referred, has unwarily admitted &s;ome fallaci|ous
<PB N="36" REF="37">
principles, and wrong &s;uppo&s;itions into the rea&s;oning, by which he &s;upports the charge. The&s;e render his arguments &s;pecious, and make tho&s;e inducements to vice appear to ari&s;e from the original and prevailing &s;pirit of our profe&s;&s;ion, which are really but the partial effects of &s;ome of its circum&s;tances, or accidental temptations ari&s;ing from the abu&s;e of it. And, be|cau&s;e the&s;e failacies run thro all the parts of his rea&s;oning, it will be proper, before we examine the particular vices, which he derives from the genius of our calling, to make a few ob&s;er|vations on the general method, in which he traces out the ten|dency of that calling.</P>
<P>IF we &s;hould allow that he has given a true account of the tendency of tho&s;e circum&s;tances in our profe&s;&s;ion, which he mentions yet we might in&s;i&s;t with rea&s;on, that he has applied the character, which re&s;ults from them, by far too generally. He ju&s;tly blames the undi&s;tingui&s;hed judgments of the vulgar, who comprehend every individual of a nation, without excep|tion, in the &s;ame national character. He ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that all that can be a&s;&s;erted with truth is, that &s;ome particular qua|lities will be more frequently met with among &s;ome cla&s;&s;es of people than others. Has he pre&s;erved this nece&s;&s;ary caution and delicacy in determining the character of the clergy? He indeed &s;ays, there are exceptions. I will not enquire, how far he can &s;eriou&s;ly admit exceptions, with re&s;pect to &s;ome particu|lars, con&s;i&s;tently with the manner in which his rea&s;oning is pur&s;ued. But certainly it was wrong to combine all the vices, which he mentions, into one character, and to a&s;cribe it to mo&s;t individuals of our order. The &s;ame temptation will not prevail with all; but only with tho&s;e to who&s;e con&s;titution it is adapted. Every day's experience proves, that that may be an irre&s;i&s;tible temptation to one man, which makes no impre&s;&s;ion on another. Tho', therefore, the genius of our calling were &s;uch as it is de&s;cribed, it could only be inferred, that &s;ome of the vices, which are enumerated, will belong to one clergy|man, others to another, but not that all the&s;e vices will be u|nited
<PB N="37" REF="38">
in the temper of any con&s;iderable number. The circum|&s;tances, which operate on the character are &s;o various, and on that account, the influence of each of them is &s;o precarious, and the turn of mind, from which each derives its force is &s;o uncertain, that we ought to rea&s;on on this &s;ubject with a pe|culiar degree of diffidence.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to &s;elect a few circum&s;tances in any profe&s;&s;ion, which, con&s;idered by them&s;elves, may appear to have an im|moral tendency; but we cannot thence infer that the profe&s;&s;i|on hath an immoral tendency upon the whole; for the influ|ence of the&s;e may be overballanced by other circum&s;tances e|qually e&s;&s;ential to it. Were we to e&s;timate the character, which any profe&s;&s;ion forms, by the &s;eparate view of &s;ome circum&s;tan|ces belonging to it, we might repre&s;ent it in a very unfavour|able light. The character of a &s;oldier is reckoned &s;o amiable by this author, that he judges it the fitte&s;t to be oppo&s;ed to ours, in order to &s;et off its deformity. But it is a &s;oldier's bu|&s;ine&s;s, to fight and kill, at the command of his &s;uperiors, with|out examining the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e. Were it fair to attend to this circum&s;tance alone, we might &s;ay that his employment nece&s;&s;arily renders him cruel, arbitrary, a contemner of right, and an ab&s;olute pe&s;t in &s;ociety. Such preci&s;ely is the rea&s;on|ing, by which this author would prove, that our office nece&s;&s;a|rily inflames many of the blacke&s;t vices of human nature. He has, by &s;ome over&s;ight, omitted many circum&s;tances e&s;&s;ential to it, which have the mo&s;t powerful influence on virtue; he has fixed on a few circum&s;tances, &s;ome of them really foreign to our office, and others of them but ca&s;ually and remotely con|nected with it; he has con&s;idered the effects, which the&s;e would produce, if they con&s;tituted the whole of our office; and, I will venture to &s;ay, he has exaggerated both the&s;e ef|fects, and the cau&s;es, from which they are repre&s;ented as pro|ceeding. In this re&s;pect his rea&s;oning is fallacious, being built on an in&s;ufficient foundation.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39">
WHEN it appears that any circum&s;tance in a profe&s;&s;ion, viewed in one light, tends to vice, we cannot always conclude, that even this circum&s;tance tends to vice upon the whole; be|cau&s;e it may as naturally, or more naturally, produce other ef|fects of an oppo&s;ite kind. It is the office of a judge to pro|nounce &s;entence exactly according to law, without regard to the ties of relation, to compa&s;&s;ion, or to worthine&s;s of charac|ter. By con&s;idering this circum&s;tance in one point of view, we might be inclined to think, that this office naturally bani|&s;hes from the heart, pity, genero&s;ity, friend&s;hip, the love of re|lations, and all the amiable offspring of benevolence. But this will not be its natural effect; for this unbia&s;&s;ed regard to right, in oppo&s;ition to all inducements from affection, is fit to cheri&s;h an attachment to publick happine&s;s, for promoting which all the rules of ju&s;tice are calculated; and, by giving con&s;tant ex|erci&s;e to the &s;en&s;e of virtue, it &s;trengthens this &s;en&s;e, and ena|bles it to controul all vicious di&s;po&s;itions, and to lay the mind open, by this means, to the operation of every generous, and kind, and worthy affection. But this author has con&s;idered tho&s;e circum&s;tances in our profe&s;&s;ion, of which he takes notice, only in one point of view; he has ob&s;erved only &s;ome of their con&s;equences on the character, but has unluckily overlooked others, more e&s;&s;ential and important, and of a perfectly con|trary nature. If this be true, his arguments will be inconclu|&s;ive, and that may be but a very <HI>partial</HI> tendency, which they would repre&s;ent as the <HI>prevailing</HI> &s;pirit of our office.</P>
<P>THIS author begins his character of our profe&s;&s;ion, by a|dopting a trite maxim, which, he &s;ays, is not altogether fal&s;e, that <HI>prie&s;ts of all religions are the &s;ame.</HI> I think, it may be ea&s;i|ly proved, that this maxim cannot be true. It nece&s;&s;arily &s;up|po&s;es, that the way of life and the occupation of prie&s;ts of all religions is perfectly the &s;ame. Different cau&s;es can produce the &s;ame or &s;imilar effects, only by means of tho&s;e qualities, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s in common. Every circum&s;tance in an occupati|on has &s;ome influence upon the character. Characters, there|fore,
<PB N="39" REF="40">
perfectly uniform, cannot be the re&s;ult of occupations, which do not coincide in all re&s;pects. Politene&s;s and the good qualities related to it make up the character, which this au|thor derives from the profe&s;&s;ion of a <HI>modern</HI> &s;oldier. He quotes a &s;aying of an ancient writer, who was perfectly acquainted with life and manners, that <HI>it is not in the power even of the gods, to make a polite &s;oldier.</HI> Yet the way of life of an <HI>an|cient</HI> &s;oldier included almo&s;t all the circum&s;tances, from which he derives the politene&s;s of a <HI>modern</HI> &s;oldier. The very &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, therefore, may produce perfectly contrary charac|ters, in different periods, by means of a difference in the pre|vailing manners of the world. It is &s;trange, that an author of uncommon penetration, who had remarked, in this in&s;tance, that a &s;mall change, in the cu&s;toms of common life, could e|ven rever&s;e the &s;pirit of one profe&s;&s;ion, &s;hould immediately af|ter produce a maxim, which &s;uppo&s;es that the greate&s;t change, in religious principles and cu&s;toms, cannot make any alterati|on in the character of prie&s;ts.&mdash;Prie&s;ts, being the mini&s;ters of religion, mu&s;t derive, from their office, a character corre|&s;pondent to the nature of that religion, in which they mini&s;ter. But &s;urely the nature of <HI>all</HI> religions is not perfectly the &s;ame. This author acknowleges in another place,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Natural hi&s;tory of religion, page 2, 25, 34.</NOTE> that no two nations, and &s;carce any two men have agreed preci&s;ely in the &s;ame religious &s;entiments; that polythei&s;m of every kind is, mo&s;t properly, a &s;ort of &s;uper&s;titious athei&s;m, &s;imilar to a be|lief of elves and fairies, which it is great complai&s;ance to dig|nify with the name of religion.

<HI>God,</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxiii. 23.

Can a pagan prie&s;t, wholly employed in the ab&s;urd rites of the former, derive <HI>from his office</HI> the &s;ame character, to which a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter will be naturally formed, by teaching the doctrines, and inculcating the duties of the latter? What one principle almo&s;t is common to their functions? The prote&s;tant religion is very different from popery, both in its form, and in its &s;pirit. The office of a popi&s;h prie&s;t is, in con&s;equence of this, very different from that of a prote&s;tant mini&s;ter. The one is continually recommending in&s;ignificant ceremonies, as a compen&s;ation for real goodne&s;s; the other is perpetually in|culcating, that nothing can compen&s;ate the want of it. Can the&s;e employments promote the very &s;ame turn of character? It can &s;carce be &s;aid, that prie&s;ts of the&s;e two religions agree in the acknowlegement of the &s;criptures; for in popery the &s;criptures are made void by legends and traditions. But, if they agree in this, the only part of their character, which they can, on this account, derive in common, from their office, is either that, which re&s;ults from the general tendency of revela|tion, the love of God and man, or tho&s;e virtues, which are re|commended particularly to the mini&s;ters of religion. And what are the&s;e? The &s;cripture commands them to be <HI>apt to teach, blamele&s;s, holy, godly, vigilant, &s;ober, temperate, not given to wine, mode&s;t, of good behaviour, ju&s;t, not covetous, not &s;trikers, not brawlers, not &s;elf-willed, not &s;oon angry, patient, forbearing, gen|tle, meek, peaceable, benevolent, given to ho&s;pitality, lovers of good men</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">1  Tim. iii. 2, 3. chap. vi. 11, 2 Tim. ii. 22, 24.

But then their character will be, in every re&s;pect, the rever&s;e of what this author has drawn for them.&mdash;In a word, becau&s;e different religions are unlike in many cir|cum&s;tances, fit to operate on the character, prie&s;ts of all religi|ons cannot be the &s;ame.</P>

IT is not very ea&s;y to determine with certainty, what place the fal&s;e maxim, which we have mentioned, really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in this author's rea&s;oning; whether it be one of the principles, which he u&s;es in a&s;certaining the tendency of the &s;acerdotal of|fice; or whether it be the conclu&s;ion which he draws from cir|cum&s;tances, &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to that office, in all the vari|ous forms of religion.</P>
<P>IF it be a principle, on which the rea&s;oning proceeds, it ought to have been clearly proved, before it was adopted; for, if it be really fal&s;e or doubtful, every argument built upon it is de&s;titute of evidence, however plau&s;ible it may appear to tho&s;e, who take the principle for granted. If it be con&s;idered in this light, there is but one argument produced for proving it. <Q REND="inline">Prie&s;ts of all religions are the &s;ame, for as chymi&s;ts ob|&s;erve, that &s;pirits, when rai&s;ed to a certain height, are all the &s;ame, from whatever materials they be extracted; &s;o the&s;e men, being elevated above humanity, acquire an u|niform character which is entirely their own.</Q> Do you think that this compari&s;on be&s;tows any evidence upon the ma|xim?

To produce this as an argu|ment, would be unworthy of this ingenious philo&s;opher, who is well acquainted with the rules of rea&s;oning; who can ea&s;ily di&s;cern the fallacy of very &s;pecious arguments; who is even &s;crupulous in allowing men to rea&s;on from one &s;ubject to ano|ther, in which the lea&s;t circum&s;tance of &s;imilarity is wanting<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on a particular providence, &amp;c. page 230.</NOTE>. It is a mere metaphor, an allu&s;ion to a fact, &s;o wholly di&s;&s;imi|lar, that it has almo&s;t too much the appearance of a turn of wit, to be admitted as an appo&s;ite image in the more &s;erious

kinds of poetry. On this account, I am inclined to think, that the maxim in que&s;tion was intended, not for a principle in the rea&s;oning, but for the conclu&s;ion deducible from it.</P>
<P>BUT if the author really de&s;igned to infer, from the nature of our office, that prie&s;ts of all religions agree in the character, which he de&s;cribes, he ought not to &s;uppo&s;e this conclu&s;ion in determining the nature of that office. This is plainly rea&s;on|ing in a circle. Yet many of his arguments re&s;t on this &s;uppo|&s;ition, and will be inconclu&s;ive without it. Could this man|ner of rea&s;oning be allowed, it is obvious that great advantage might be derived from it. By means of it, all the ba&s;e&s;t cor|ruptions of religion come to be regarded as e&s;&s;ential parts of it; every thing, which, in con&s;equence of the corruption of reli|gion, has ever been attempted by its mini&s;ters, in the mo&s;t de|generate &s;tate of things, for &s;upporting or promoting that cor|ruption, comes to be repre&s;ented as a nece&s;&s;ary part of the pa|&s;toral office, tho it be in fact repugnant to the very nature and de&s;ign of it.</P>
<P>BUT if we would examine fairly and impartially, what is the tendency of the pa&s;toral office, with re&s;pect to any virtue or vice, we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>office</HI> it&s;elf from the <HI>abu&s;es</HI> of it. In order to this, we mu&s;t take our account of it only from the &s;criptures; we mu&s;t con&s;ider the end, for which they declare that it was appointed, the employment on which they put chri&s;tian mini&s;ters for promoting that end, and the rules, which they pre&s;cribe concerning the manner of executing their em|ployment. An infidel cannot ju&s;tly proceed in any other way; for whether the &s;criptures have any real authority or not, it is only in them, that the in&s;titution of this office, or the manner of executing it, is &s;aid to be contained. Whatever is not, by the &s;criptures, incumbent on a clergyman, is <HI>foreign</HI> to his of|fice, at lea&s;t; and may be <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent</HI> with it, however general|ly it be practi&s;ed. An enquirer mu&s;t fir&s;t di&s;cover, in this man|ner, what our office really is; and then he mu&s;t con&s;ider all
<PB N="43" REF="44">
the circum&s;tances of it together, trace out all the natural effects of each, ballance the good and the bad effects of the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tance, and weigh the tendencies of different circum&s;tances again&s;t one another, before he can expect to determine its ge|nuine &s;pirit. This will be, indeed, a difficult and complex induction; but philo&s;ophers know well, that an induction e|qually &s;evere is requi&s;ite, before a certain conclu&s;ion can be e|&s;tabli&s;hed, in &s;ubjects of a le&s;s intricate nature, than the for|mation of human characters. Whether the author, who&s;e ar|guments we are examining, has ob&s;erved this method; whe|ther, in e&s;timating our character, he has not, on the contrary, fixed on &s;ome circum&s;tances in our profe&s;&s;ion, con&s;idered even the&s;e but in one light, pointed out only &s;ome of their effects upon the character, unduly exaggerated particulars, and argu|ed from circum&s;tances foreign to the office of a chri&s;tian mini&s;|ter, nay wholly contradictory it; I will appeal to the impar|tial; I will appeal to his own candour, after he has reviewed his arguments, by the acknowleged rules of rea&s;oning. It will appear in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from the following examination, of tho&s;e vices, which our office is &s;aid to have a fixt and unalter|able tendency to promote. They are <HI>hypocri&s;y, &s;uper&s;tition, am|bition, vanity, party-&s;pirit, rancour.</HI> Truly a black catalogue of the mo&s;t diabolic vices! Had one of us drawn &s;uch a charac|ter for the laity in general, or for any particular profe&s;&s;ion, would not it have been cited as an in&s;tance of <HI>prie&s;tly fury?</HI> But de&s;titute, as we are repre&s;ented to be, of the noble virtues of <HI>humanity, meekne&s;s</HI> and <HI>moderation,</HI> we will content our&s;elves with &s;ubmitting our cau&s;e coolly to the cognizance of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>DO tho&s;e abominable vices, which have been mentioned indeed compo&s;e the genuine character of the mini&s;ters of Je|&s;us? Are the&s;e the natural re&s;ult of their profe&s;&s;ion? Say, chri&s;tians, when you look around you, and ob&s;erve the mini&s;|ters, who come within your knowledge, do you really find <HI>the&s;e</HI> to be the qualities, which are predominant in the temper and conduct of the greate&s;t part of them?&mdash;Would you be
<PB N="44" REF="45">
di&s;po&s;ed to give greater <HI>indulgence</HI> to the&s;e vices in a mini&s;ter than in another? Or would not your hearts condemn them as <HI>un&s;uitable</HI> to his profe&s;&s;ion? If the&s;e vices re&s;ulted nece&s;&s;arily from our office, would it not follow, that mankind mu&s;t be di&s;|po&s;ed to excu&s;e <HI>them</HI> in mini&s;ters, on account of the difficul|ty of their avoiding them? But can our adver&s;aries &s;ay, that hypocri&s;y, ambition, pride, rancour, or any other vice in that horrid catalogue, by which they de&s;cribe the &s;pirit of our cal|ling, is regarded with a more favourable eye in one of us, than in men of a different occupation? The weak may not perceive &s;ome exertions of the&s;e principles to be vicious, the prejudiced may mi&s;take them for virtuous: but whenever they are at all di&s;approved as wrong, are not they, as well as other vices, con|demned with &s;ingular &s;everity in a clergyman? Doth not the common &s;en&s;e of mankind thus declare that our office tends to promote the virtue, oppo&s;ite to the&s;e, as well as other virtues? Some vices are reckoned more indecent in a clergyman than others: but <HI>all</HI> vices are reckoned more indecent in him, than in any other man. Some virtues are e&s;teemed more indi&s;pen|&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary than others, but <HI>every</HI> virtue is e&s;teemed more requi&s;ite in this profe&s;&s;ion than in other profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THERE are two circum&s;tances in our profe&s;&s;ion, which, it is &s;aid, nece&s;&s;arily form us to <HI>hypocri&s;y</HI>&mdash;One is the obliga|tion, which it lays us under to ob&s;erve &s;trict decency.&mdash;Decen|cy con&s;i&s;ts in ab&s;taining from all behaviour, that is either vici|ous or offen&s;ive. The mo&s;t natural principle of this ab&s;tinence is virtue; and our office obliges us to decency, only by oblig|ing us to blamele&s;s virtue. Did it exert its full influence upon our character, we &s;hould not &s;tand in need of di&s;&s;imulation, in order to appear virtuous. Indeed it cannot be expected, in the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate, that this office will exert its full in|fluence univer&s;ally, or produce that exalted virtue, which it demands, in all who exerci&s;e it. On this account many mi|ni&s;ters may have an inducement from their profe&s;&s;ion, to en|deavour in particular in&s;tances, to conceal vices and imperfec|tions,
<PB N="45" REF="46">
which really belong to them. Yet &s;till this is but a &s;e|condary tendency, by which the profe&s;&s;ion cannot be fairly characterized; a tendency too, which reflects honour upon it, becau&s;e it proceeds only from the &s;trength of its original ten|dency to virtue.&mdash;And is that conduct, which even this &s;e|condary tendency produces, ab&s;olutely blameable? Can it be allowed, that all re&s;erve is criminal hypocri&s;y? Is every man obliged in hone&s;ty to di&s;cover to others all the faults, of which he is con&s;cious in him&s;elf? Is it not <HI>right</HI> to conceal our vices from the knowledge of others, by all lawful means? Will it not in &s;ome mea&s;ure prevent the infection of our bad example? Certainly it is not criminal for a per&s;on to endeavour to reform him&s;elf from any vice, which he has contracted. Yet this can be done, only by &s;etting a guard over his word and actions, and ab&s;taining from giving &s;cope to tho&s;e wrong pa&s;&s;ions, which continue to &s;ollicit him very powerfully. May not a mini&s;|ter ab&s;tain from the practice of vices, to which he is di&s;po&s;ed, from a &s;en&s;e of duty, or from a de&s;ire to extirpate them by de|grees; or may not he ab&s;tain from things which he knows to be lawful, in charitable indulgence to the weakne&s;s of others, or from a regard to character, without any fault, without be|ing liable to the charge of hypocri&s;y, without incurring any danger of de&s;troying the candour and ingenuity of his temper, or making an irreparable breach in his character? Is not the conduct rather laudable?&mdash;Indeed if a clergyman be ob&s;tinate|ly wicked, he will be expo&s;ed to a temptation, from his office, to <HI>blameable</HI> hypocri&s;y. In every profe&s;&s;ion, the vicious are often induced to affect an appearance of virtue, in order to pro|mote their de&s;igns. The pa&s;toral office will not render every in|dividual really virtuous. But it cannot be executed by a per&s;on who is known to be vicious. It is, therefore, probable that a vicious mini&s;ter will put on a fal&s;e &s;how of goodne&s;s. But &s;hall the whole order be, for this rea&s;on, charged with affecting a continued grimace, in order to &s;upport the veneration of the ignorant vulgar, and promote the &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;tition? Ab|&s;urd <HI>corruptions</HI> of religion there have been, which were intend|ed
<PB N="46" REF="47">
for promoting a &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;tition, and which could not be &s;upported without an implicit veneration of the prie&s;t: but to argue from the&s;e, is to confound the vile&s;t perver&s;ions of religion with chri&s;tianity, the ba&s;e&s;t pro&s;titutions of the pa&s;to|ral office with the office it&s;elf. Where do the &s;criptures enjoin a clergyman to promote a &s;uper&s;titious &s;pirit? The clergyman, who aims at it, pur&s;ues a wrong end, &s;ugge&s;ted to him by his corrupt pa&s;&s;ions, not by his office, to which it is altogether fo|reign; and the &s;ame corrupt pa&s;&s;ions lead him to pervert his of|fice, that it may become &s;ub&s;ervient to this end. For what part of the pa&s;toral function is the blind veneration of the ignorant vulgar requi&s;ite? Indeed we cannot execute our office, with|out being careful to de&s;erve e&s;teem; virtue alone de&s;erves it; our office, therefore, prompts us &s;trongly to virtue. If any of us attempt to &s;upply the want of virtue, by affected grimace, in order to procure e&s;teem, he u&s;es unlawful means of accom|pli&s;hing a lawful end; he is guilty of ba&s;e hypocri&s;y, the temp|tation to which ari&s;es indeed from his office, but ari&s;es &s;olely from its rendering virtue nece&s;&s;ary for the execution of it. If any of us weakly mi&s;take grimace for the genuine dignity of virtue, he confounds a vice with a good quality, to which it bears &s;ome general re&s;emblance. But how does the mini&s;teri|al office contribute to the mi&s;take? Do any of the duties of that office, de&s;cribed in &s;cripture, or does the example of our Saviour, who <HI>came eating and drinking</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Matth. xi. 19.</NOTE>, or the example of his apo&s;tles lead into it? It ari&s;es only from the weakne&s;s of men, which produces &s;imilar in&s;tances of &s;elf-deceit in all pro|fo&s;&s;ions.&mdash;We may add, that our danger of being &s;e|duced into hypocritical grimace cannot ju&s;tly make the cha|racter of our order appear in a di&s;advantageous light, when it is compared with the character of other ranks of men. The weakne&s;s of our nature may render that corruption of religion and of our office, from which the temptation to hypocri&s;y ari&s;|es, very frequent; but the &s;ame cau&s;e will as frequently in|troduce di&s;hone&s;t views, and di&s;hone&s;t artifices, of different
<PB N="47" REF="48">
kinds, into other profe&s;&s;ions. When the pa&s;toral office is actu|ally perverted from its real end, to promote the purpo&s;es of a corrupt religion, the temptation to hypocri&s;y may be very &s;trong, &s;o as actually to prevail with many of our order; but the perver&s;ions of other profe&s;&s;ions afford temptations, to tho&s;e &s;pecies of di&s;hone&s;ty and craft which &s;uit them, as irre&s;i&s;tible and as univer&s;ally prevalent. The hypocri&s;y, which ari&s;es from our compliance with the&s;e temptations is highly blameable and pernicious, but it is not generally ba&s;er or more de&s;tructive than the various frauds and artifices, which are practi&s;ed by bad men in other callings.&mdash;On the whole, our office leads primarily to real virtue, not to an affected appearance of it; it very naturally produces a grave and &s;erious tem|per, and a cautious attention to our deportment, which may be di&s;agreeable to the gay and di&s;&s;ipated, and which they may uncharitably charge with hypocri&s;y, becau&s;e of its contrariety to their own manners, but which is totally di&s;tinct from vicious grimace; corruptions of religion may pervert our office &s;o far as to lead us to pur&s;ue ends, which cannot be accompli&s;hed without affected grimace, but the temptation to it is to be im|puted, not to our office, or to religion, but to the corruption of both, and to the weakne&s;s and fault of individuals; and whatever degree of grimace may really prevail among the cler|gy, it cannot ju&s;tly expo&s;e them to peculiar di&s;approbation, becau&s;e many kinds of di&s;hone&s;t art, as odious to the full as this, are equally general among other ranks of men.</P>
<P>IT is likewi&s;e &s;aid, that our office promotes hypocri&s;y, by leading us to be employed in the exerci&s;es of religion oftener than we can be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the real &s;pirit of devotion.&mdash;It leads us, indeed, to be frequently employed in the exerci&s;es of religion. The natural tendency of this is, to improve a temper of piety in our &s;ouls; for every habit is formed and &s;trengthened by frequent exerci&s;e. Mini&s;ters will &s;ometimes find their devotion languid, when they are called to exerci&s;e it. But the more con&s;tantly an affection is exerted, the &s;tronger and more habitual it is rendered by this means, the le&s;s will a
<PB N="48" REF="49">
per&s;on be indi&s;po&s;ed for exerting it. If, therefore, our office leads us to be more con&s;tant in the exerci&s;es of devotion, than other men, it will nece&s;&s;arily render us le&s;s &s;ubject, than others, to fits of languor. They who have not originally a higher or more con&s;tant &s;pirit of devotion, than the generality of man|kind, will naturally acquire it, by being engaged in our pro|fe&s;&s;ion. It cannot be denied, that our employment has an e&s;&s;ential and &s;trong tendency to form us to eminent and con|&s;tant piety, the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and the mo&s;t excellent of all vir|tues, without ab&s;urdly &s;uppo&s;ing, either that frequent acts of any virtue have no tendency to promote a habit of that virtue, or that the &s;trength of a habit has no tendency to lead us to act frequently upon it.&mdash;But it is &s;aid, that our office obli|ges us to affect devotion often, when we are already jaded with the exerci&s;es of it, or when our minds are engaged in worldly occupations. Suppo&s;e that it &s;ometimes called us to devotion, when we are in this &s;ituation. Is it nece&s;&s;arily unlawful to at|tempt to exert a good affection, when a per&s;on is ill di&s;po&s;ed to it? If the attempt proceed from a &s;en&s;e of duty, it is &s;urely virtuous. And it is remarked by philo&s;ophers<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Bacon de Aug. Scient. lib. 7. cap. 3.</NOTE>, that one of the mo&s;t proper &s;ea&s;ons for exerting a principle, &s;o as to im|prove it, is when we are wor&s;t di&s;po&s;ed. Then a &s;trong effort will be nece&s;&s;ary to overcome the oppo&s;ition ari&s;ing from our reluctance; and by this effort the principle will acquire great|er &s;trength, than if it had been exerci&s;ed more ea&s;ily<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hume's Di&s;&s;ert, on the Pa&s;&s;ions pag. 176.</NOTE>. When other men find them&s;elves indi&s;po&s;ed for devotion, they may be tempted to neglect it; by neglecting it they will become more indi&s;po&s;ed; and are thus in danger of becoming, by de|grees, habitually impious; but a clergyman, being under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity, from his office, to exerci&s;e it, is led, by this means, to take one of the fitte&s;t opportunities for cultivating a temper of real piety.&mdash;As our affections ari&s;e directly from ju&s;t con|ceptions of their objects, we can &s;eldom be &s;o aver&s;e from the exerci&s;e of any affection, that it cannot be produced by due
<PB N="49" REF="50">
attention to its object. Our office leads us to frequent medi|tation on that God, who is the object of devotion, and on all tho&s;e &s;ubjects, which can render our &s;entiments of his perfecti|ons vigorous and lively. It thus affords us the proper and di|rect mean of rou&s;ing pious affections, when they are languid. And &s;ince our office thus fixes us in contemplation of God, and obliges us frequently to exerci&s;e devout affections towards him, we mu&s;t be gro&s;sly faulty, if we be, at any time, &s;o ill-di&s;po&s;ed, as to approach to him with feigned devotion. By the&s;e advantages, which our profe&s;&s;ion gives us, piety may be rendered &s;o habitually predominant in our temper, that it &s;hall eagerly &s;eize every opportunity of acting, and that we &s;hall be able to exerci&s;e &s;incere devotion, in circum&s;tances, in which they, who are &s;eldom employed in religious duties, judging of us by them&s;elves, may think it impo&s;&s;ible, and cen&s;ure our wor&s;hip as hypocritical.&mdash;But is there no danger that we may be contented with going the round of religious exerci&s;es, without being at pains to excite the inward affections, which ought to animate them? And if we &s;hould, will not this pro|duce hypocri&s;y? Undoubtedly. Mere formal wor&s;hip, fre|quently gone about, tends to make us think that we are alrea|dy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e inward affections from which our wor&s;hip &s;hould have proceeded, and thus prevents our &s;etting our&s;elves to cultivate them, and confirms us in hypocri&s;y. This danger ari&s;es from the very con&s;titution of human nature, and extends to all external actions, which may &s;ometimes proceed from o|ther principles than the virtue, to which they corre&s;pond, and will, in that ca&s;e, di&s;gui&s;e our want of that virtue from us. If mini&s;ters, notwith&s;tanding the peculiar advantages, which their profe&s;&s;ion gives them for cultivating a temper of real pi|ety, engage in devotion without exciting that temper into act, they will be in greater danger, than others, of becoming in|&s;en&s;ible of their want of piety, and will more quickly contract a &s;trong habit of hypocri&s;y, by rea&s;on of their frequent calls to devotion. But is this habit really wor&s;e, than a want of all appearance of religion, which the&s;e men would have infallibly
<PB N="50" REF="51">
run into, from the &s;ame degeneracy of mind, in any profe&s;&s;ion, which did not give them frequent calls to devotion? Or tho it were, can our profe&s;&s;ion be ju&s;tly blamed for requiring tho&s;e acts of devotion, from the wrong performance of which that habit &s;prings? If it could, it mu&s;t follow, that <HI>all</HI> exerci&s;e of devotion is not only u&s;ele&s;s but highly dangerous. Nay, on this principle, all good external actions mu&s;t be cen&s;ured, as tending to corrupt the character, becau&s;e they may be perfor|med, when they do not proceed from their natural principle, and becau&s;e, when they are thus performed, they will rather ob&s;truct, than promote the improvement of that principle.&mdash;But, after all, a clergyman can really be in no <HI>peculiar</HI> danger from the <HI>public</HI> exerci&s;es of religion, becau&s;e in them all the people profe&s;s to join; and yet they alone appear to be intend|ed by this author. He &s;eems to have had tho&s;e prie&s;ts in his eye, who are almo&s;t con&s;tantly employed in running over forms of devotion, in a language which the people do not under&s;tand. But is it fair to draw an argument from them, to clergymen, who, by their office, only pre&s;ide in the&s;e exerci&s;es of devotion in which all the people are as much concerned as they? He &s;eems likewi&s;e to confound mechanical warmth and exta&s;y, which mu&s;t needs be tran&s;ient, with calm and rational piety, which may actuate the mind as habitually, and uninterrupted|ly, and be as much in readine&s;s to exert it&s;elf, whenever an occa&s;ion offers, as gratitude, friend&s;hip, or any other affection of the human heart.&mdash;In a word, our profe&s;&s;ion is &s;ingularly fit to form us to &s;incere and exalted piety, by obliging us to fre|quency in tho&s;e exerci&s;es of devotion, by the right performance of which alone a temper of piety can be formed, and by giving us great advantages for performing them aright; we may in|deed perform them in a wrong manner, it may require &s;trict at|tention to avoid it, if we do not be&s;tow this attention, we may become hypocritical in our devotions; but the fault will be chargeable, not on our office, but on our&s;elves, who have re|&s;i&s;ted its primary and natural impul&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="52">
TO conclude this head, the prevailing tendency of tho&s;e functions, in which we are employed, is to promote virtue and piety; they will tempt the ob&s;tinately vicious to hypocri&s;y, but they could not cea&s;e to tempt them to this, without cea&s;ing to urge powerfully to univer&s;al goodne&s;s. Tho&s;e only will be|come hypocrites by being engaged in our profe&s;&s;ion, who would have been either di&s;hone&s;t or abandoned, if they had followed another occupation.</P>
<P>ANOTHER of the vices imputed to our office is <HI>&s;uper|&s;tition,</HI> leading us to regard an appearance of religion, or zeal for religious ob&s;ervances, as a full compen&s;ation for all vices and violations of morality.&mdash;But is there any &s;pirit, again&s;t which the &s;criptures, the only rule of our in&s;tructions, guard mankind with greater care? Can we teach the religion of <HI>Je|&s;us,</HI> without making it a great part of our bu&s;ine&s;s to warn our people again&s;t this vile perver&s;ion of devotion? What circum|&s;tance can there be, then, in our profe&s;&s;ion, that puts us in pe|culiar danger of &s;uper&s;tition? This author really mentions none. In&s;tead of &s;upporting his charge, in&s;tead of attempting to prove, that &s;uper&s;tition is one of tho&s;e characters, which are entirely our own, he ob&s;erves that all mankind almo&s;t have a &s;trong propen&s;ity to it; an ob&s;ervation, which is incon&s;i&s;tent with its being peculiar to the clergy. Our office, indeed, naturally tends to form us to a temper of devotion; but from the warmth of genuine devotion, &s;uper&s;tition never can ari&s;e. On the con|trary, it is plain from the nature of the di&s;po&s;itions them&s;elves, as well as from the declarations of &s;cripture, that reverence, and love of God, gratitude to him, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his provi|dence, regard to his authority, and to his judgment of us, and all the other parts of real piety lead to univer&s;al virtue, and cannot be completed without producing it. All mankind ap|pear to be &s;en&s;ible of this. They will allow a per&s;on to be re|ally ju&s;t or temperate, tho' &s;ome other virtues be plainly want|ing in his character. But if a man want any virtue, and have an appearance of piety, they determine that his piety is in&s;in|cere
<PB N="52" REF="53">
and hypocritical; con&s;cious that, if it were genuine, it could not &s;ail to produce every moral virtue.&mdash;If men be apt to &s;u&s;pect the probity of tho&s;e, who put on an extraordinary appearance of religion, their judgment may be ea&s;ily account|ed for. For it is too obvious to e&s;cape their notice, that real piety is attended with little &s;how; and it is an ob&s;ervation, which all men make in numberle&s;s other ca&s;es, that whenever a man affects any good quality, which he does not really po&s;|&s;e&s;s, he is &s;ure to overact his part.&mdash;But we need not dwell on this article of the charge; for the author, in&s;tead of pro|ducing any evidence for it, indulges him&s;elf in remarks, which only tend to depreciate all religion, by confounding it with &s;u|per&s;tition. An examination of this point, tho' it be important in it&s;elf, is foreign to our pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THE clergy have been often accu&s;ed of <HI>ambition,</HI> and the accu&s;ation has been moulded into many different forms. This author choo&s;es to repre&s;ent them as a &s;et of men, who&s;e ambi|tion can be &s;atisfied, only by promoting ignorance, and &s;uper|&s;tition, and implicit faith, and pious frauds, that, by argu|ments drawn from another world, they may move this world at their plea&s;ure; whereas the ambition of other men may com|monly be &s;atisfied, by excelling in their particular profe&s;&s;ion, and thereby promoting the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety.&mdash;Is this a fair compari&s;on of our character with that of others? Is it not plainly a compari&s;on of laudable ambition in them, with the greate&s;t corruption of that principle in us? But is the ambiti|on of other men always of the prai&s;e-worthy kind? Is it this that has prompted individuals to rai&s;e them&s;elves by &s;upplant|ing better men, by fraud, by perfidy, by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, by eve|ry the mo&s;t &s;hocking crime? Is it this that has di&s;tracted king|doms with faction and rebellion, and filled the world with war and blood&s;hed? Will it be &s;aid, that the ambition of the laity has never appeared in this form, or produced the&s;e effects? And is not this the form of it, which ought, in ju&s;t argument, to have been oppo&s;ed to wrong turned ambition in a clergy|man?
<PB N="53" REF="54">
On the other hand, will it be a&s;&s;erted, that our office does not &s;ugge&s;t to us a laudable object of ambition, which will bear to be compared with the de&s;ires of others, to &s;erve man|kind, by excelling in their own profe&s;&s;ions? Our office, bre|thren, <HI>naturally</HI> propo&s;es to us only one object of ambition, the noble&s;t indeed that can be propo&s;ed, to be <HI>workers toge|ther with God, and with Chri&s;t,</HI> in recommending <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> to mankind<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 20. 21. chap. vi. 1.</NOTE>, and thus promoting the mo&s;t valuable inte|re&s;ts of &s;ociety. It is the <HI>direct</HI> end of our office, to excite man|kind, by the di&s;coveries of a future world, which rea&s;on and revelation make, to that conduct, which alone can promote their true happine&s;s, both in time and in eternity. If we mi&s;|apply the&s;e engines, to move men at our plea&s;ure, or to render them &s;ub&s;ervient to our de&s;igns, we ba&s;ely deviate from the end of our vocation, and, in&s;tead of it, pur&s;ue an oppo&s;ite, an unworthy, and pernicious end. And &s;hall that be imputed to our office, which is contradictory to its whole de&s;ign?&mdash;But may not our office contribute, in &s;ome way to this conduct? Mo&s;t men are prone to prefer pre&s;ent and temporal, to &s;piritual and eternal objects, and to pur&s;ue them by whatever means they can. Many, who were not of our order, have often pro|&s;tituted religion, by making it a tool for promoting their &s;ecu|lar ends. The vice is not, therefore, peculiar to our order. To be employed in the functions of our office will never lead a man to form the&s;e worldly de&s;igns, which can be accompli&s;hed by a pro&s;titution of religion; the&s;e are &s;ugge&s;ted by the vici|ou&s;ne&s;s of his own temper, or by his being engaged in foreign occupations, and would not probably have been formed, if he had confined him&s;elf to his proper bu&s;ine&s;s. Indeed when am|bitious views are, from the&s;e cau&s;es, once formed by a clergy|man, he will endeavour to promote them by tho&s;e religious in|&s;truments, which his office affords, more readily than by any others, becau&s;e they are mo&s;t directly in his eye. His office obliges him to apply them to the mo&s;t glorious purpo&s;e; this
<PB N="54" REF="55">
is an argument for its excellence: his wickedne&s;s prompts him to mi&s;apply them to bad purpo&s;es; this is wholly his own fault. Ought the world to have been deprived of the only means by which virtue and happine&s;s can be obtained, becau&s;e the abu&s;e of them may &s;ometimes be pernicious? This vice cannot, therefore, ju&s;tly be imputed to the genius of our cal|ling; for it has no primary or e&s;&s;ential tendency to promote it; on the contrary it has a very remote, indirect, and accidental influence upon it; it will &s;upply a temptation to it very &s;el|dom, never except by rea&s;on of the previous corruption either of individuals, or of the &s;pirit of religion; the vice will not be generally characteri&s;tical of our order, except in the mo&s;t degenerate &s;tate of things; on this account, and likewi&s;e be|cau&s;e ambition often a&s;&s;umes the &s;ame form in the re&s;t of man|kind, and becau&s;e other forms of it are equally dete&s;tible and pernicious, particular in&s;tances of clergymen applying religion to &s;elfi&s;h or worldly purpo&s;es cannot, with any rea&s;on, render the character of the profe&s;&s;ion peculiarly odious.&mdash;If we promote ignorance, and &s;uper&s;tition, and implicit faith, and pious frauds, for any end, we u&s;e the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable means. But it is impo&s;&s;ible, that our office can, in the remot|e&s;t manner, prompt us to u&s;e them. The method, by which its genuine end can be promoted, is the <HI>manife&s;tation of the truth</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv. 2.</NOTE>; our bu&s;ine&s;s is <HI>rightly to divide the word of truth</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 15.</NOTE> to all, to diffu&s;e religious and moral knowledge to the utmo&s;t of our power. Is this the &s;ame with promoting ignorance and error? Say, all the world, is it not perfectly the rever&s;e? Our office tends &s;o directly to make us <HI>apt to teach</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iii. 2. 2 Tim. ii. 24.</NOTE>, that it cannot even afford a temptation to the conduct of which we are accu&s;ed, 'till it be fir&s;t perverted to the very oppo&s;ite of what it ought to be. It cannot put it in our power to pur&s;ue this conduct, except all the re&s;t of mankind be, in one way or ano|ther, as degenerate as our&s;elves.&mdash;What then could lead a per&s;on to charge our office with a tendency, ab&s;olutely contra|dictory
<PB N="55" REF="56">
to its genuine &s;pirit? There is one religion, the prie&s;ts of which pur&s;ue this unnatural conduct. Chri&s;tianity was gra|dually corrupted from its genuine purity, during &s;everal ages of ignorance and barbarity, by a mixture of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;ur|dities of pagani&s;m. The mon&s;trous medley could not bear ex|amination, and, therefore, the prie&s;ts of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> church be|took them&s;elves to the only means, by which it could be pro|tected from contempt or indignation. But is it candid to tran&s;|fer their character, to other chri&s;tian mini&s;ters, who&s;e conduct is avowedly the contrary? This were to take it for granted, that prie&s;ts of all religions are the &s;ame, not only <HI>without</HI> evi|dence, but really in <HI>contradiction</HI> to the evidence of actual ex|perience. This character &s;prung, not from the office of teach|ing religion, but from men's having cea&s;ed to teach true reli|gion: it can be a&s;cribed only to tho&s;e cau&s;es, which pro|duced the corruption of religion, and, by that means nece&s;&s;a|rily changed the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;acred function, and rever&s;ed the natural character of the clergy.</P>
<P>IT is affirmed, likewi&s;e, that we lie under a peculiar temp|tation, from our office, to <HI>vanity,</HI> and an overweening conceit of our&s;elves, becau&s;e we are regarded with veneration, and are even deemed &s;acred, by the ignorant multitude.&mdash;There are few &s;ituations, from which men may not take occa&s;ion for criminal vanity; for there are few, which do not give per&s;ons &s;ome real or imaginary advantage; and every opinion of ad|vantage, however trivial, <HI>may</HI> produce an high conceit of our|&s;elves. But the more important, or the more exalted any &s;ta|tion is, the &s;tronger its temptations to this vice. Our office has plainly very con&s;iderable dignity; the provinces of the phi|lo&s;opher and the orator are united in it; it is de&s;igned for the noble&s;t end, for training men to virtue, and fitting them for e|ternal happine&s;s. It is by its excellence alone, that it leads us to &s;et a value on our&s;elves; and it has this tendency in com|mon with every thing, which has any degree of worth.&mdash;But it is not every kind of &s;elf-e&s;teem, that can be reckoned faulty.
<PB N="56" REF="57">
A ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of any real and important advantage is not blam|ed in others, and cannot be blameable in us. It mu&s;t be own|ed, however, that all men are very prone to an exce&s;s of pride, and very ready to expre&s;s it in an improper manner. Vanity, o&s;tentation, arrogance, in&s;olence are highly cen&s;urable, both in mini&s;ters, and in others. But the cen&s;ure is due &s;olely to the individuals, who abu&s;e the advantages of their &s;ituation, to fo|&s;ter the&s;e vices in their &s;ouls. The fault will be peculiarly chargeable on individuals in our profe&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e it gives us &s;trong inducements to avoid it. The very dignity of our of|fice will fill a man of an ingenuous &s;pirit with deep humility, when he compares it with his own unworthine&s;s. <HI>Who is &s;uf|ficient for the&s;e things</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. ii. 16.</NOTE>?

And can we always avoid reflecting, that the humble and <HI>low|ly Je&s;us</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Mat. xi. 29.</NOTE> is our founder? If we cannot, will not his example have &s;ome tendency to form <HI>this mind in us, which was al&s;o in him</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Philip. ii. 5.</NOTE>?&mdash;The principle of &s;ympathy is very powerful. By means of it we enter into all the &s;entiments of others. The good opinion of the world cannot fail to have a con&s;iderable in|fluence on our judgment of our&s;elves. But have mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel any peculiar &s;ecurity for veneration or re&s;pect? It is plain, that many profe&s;&s;ions are, in the general e&s;timation of the world, more reputable than theirs. It will be difficult to point out any &s;et of men, on whom greater reproach and contempt has been poured out, <HI>for their work's &s;ake,</HI> than the teachers of religion. Undi&s;tingui&s;hed reflexions on this order are thrown out without re&s;erve, and hearkened to with plea&s;ure, by many, who would regard general cen&s;ures of any other body in the gro&s;s, as an evidence of prejudice and ill-breeding. If, there|fore, general reproach and ridicule have any tendency to mor|tify the vanity of mankind, the clergy, at lea&s;t in the pre&s;ent age, are furni&s;hed with a peculiar antidote again&s;t vanity.&mdash;
<PB N="57" REF="58">
All the veneration, which we can expect on account of our of|fice, it is in&s;inuated, is that of the ignorant multitude. We will not complain of the &s;everity of this in&s;inuation; we hope that our profe&s;&s;ion may give us a right, while we maintain a charac|ter becoming it, to the re&s;pect of the mo&s;t knowing. It will prompt us more &s;trongly to vanity, by this means; but if we allow that pa&s;&s;ion to have any other effect, than to give us a new rea&s;on for endeavouring to de&s;erve their e&s;teem, it will be wholly our own fault. If we cannot expect the e&s;teem of the di&s;cerning, we can &s;carce have an irre&s;i&s;tible temptation to vanity, from the veneration of the ignorant, except we be form|ed very differently from all other men, who are mo&s;t apt to be elated with the approbation of the mo&s;t knowing judges. And, truly, in the pre&s;ent age, we cannot certainly obtain the veneration even of the ignorant; they, who oppo&s;e religion, or inveigh again&s;t its mini&s;ters, are formidable rivals to us. The&s;e are not generally like this author. His infidelity will proba|bly rob him of &s;ome part of the attention and regard, which his philo&s;ophical genius, and ta&s;te would have otherwi&s;e com|manded from the curious and intelligent. But almo&s;t all the re&s;t owe their reputation &s;olely to their irreligion, and mu&s;t have been neglected or contemned, even by the mo&s;t ignorant and carele&s;s reader, if they had attempted to write on any other &s;ubject.</P>
<P>OUR office is, al&s;o, cen&s;ured, becau&s;e it leads us to bear a <HI>great regard</HI> to the members of our own profe&s;&s;ion, and to have a <HI>particular concern</HI> for the intere&s;ts of our own body.&mdash;But can this be culpable? Becau&s;e our power to do good is very limit|ed, becau&s;e our beneficence would become u&s;ele&s;s, if it were di&s;&s;ipated equally among all mankind, God has wi&s;ely formed our con&s;titution in &s;uch a manner, that benevolence ri&s;es in ve|ry different degrees towards different per&s;ons. The human heart is &s;o &s;trongly turned to love, that we eagerly take occa|&s;ion for exerci&s;ing a peculiar degree of this affection, not on|ly from relation, per&s;onal qualities, or favours received, but al|&s;o from more trivial circum&s;tances, a name, a neighbourhood,
<PB N="58" REF="59">
or the like. This con&s;titution of nature, nece&s;&s;arily leads men to love tho&s;e of their own profe&s;&s;ion, and to be concerned for the intere&s;t of the &s;ociety, to which they belong. Was this ever before cen&s;ured as vicious? To neglect this were highly blameable. It is chiefly by particular kind affections, that men are linked together in &s;ociety.&mdash;If the intere&s;ts of clergymen of the &s;ame religion be really united more clo&s;ely, than the in|tere&s;ts of tho&s;e of other profe&s;&s;ions, our office has a direct ten|dency, by this circum&s;tance, to prompt us &s;trongly to one &s;pe|cies of benevolence and public &s;pirit, and thus is peculiarly fit to promote one of the mo&s;t amiable virtues. The intere&s;ts of men of other profe&s;&s;ions not only are <HI>di&s;tinct,</HI> becau&s;e each carries on his bu&s;ine&s;s apart, but often <HI>interfere,</HI> and by this means, the love, which they ought to bear to one another, is extingui&s;hed. Ought it not to be mentioned to the honour of our profe&s;&s;ion, in&s;tead of being objected to it, as a reproach, that it does not expo&s;e us to this danger?&mdash;All particular attachments may, indeed, be carried too far, and ob&s;tract the exerci&s;e of other &s;o|cial virtues; love to a family may render a man negligent of the good of his country: even patrioti&s;m may make a man too carele&s;s about the intere&s;ts of the kind. But is that con&s;tituti|on of our nature, which makes us capable of the&s;e attachments to be blamed on this account? In like manner, if &s;ome clergy|men pervert that ju&s;t benevolence, which they owe to their &s;o|ciety, into a narrow party-&s;pirit, di&s;po&s;ing them to &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts of the laity, or leading them to aim at the &s;upport of their own peculiar tenets, or at the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of antago|ni&s;ts, in&s;tead of the <HI>real</HI> intere&s;t of the order, which always coin|cides with the intere&s;t of truth and virtue, and, by con&s;equence, with the intere&s;t of mankind; is the office to be therefore cen&s;ured? It gives occa&s;ion to this mi&s;conduct, only by con|taining a circum&s;tance, which has a direct tendency to promote an amiable virtue, but which is capable of being abu&s;ed by the folly or perver&s;ene&s;s of men.&mdash;At the &s;ame time, our office tends &s;trongly to prevent the abu&s;es, which might ari&s;e from an exce&s;&s;ive attachment to our own &s;ociety. We teach a religion
<PB N="59" REF="60">
which repre&s;ents us and all mankind as connected together by every endearing relation, which can excite the tendere&s;t love, and by every &s;imilarity of condition, which can improve our love by &s;ympathy and fellow-feeling. Our office &s;ets frequent|ly in our view the general connections of the children of men; and it unites us with mankind by peculiar ties. It intere&s;ts us in their mo&s;t important concerns, it engages us in the mo&s;t af|fectionate intercour&s;e with their very &s;ouls. Benevolence can be cheri&s;hed only by tho&s;e exerci&s;es of beneficence, for which the circum&s;tances of men give opportunity. A mini&s;ter has all the &s;ame opportunites of doing good, with another man; and, if he really execute his office, he mu&s;t have many peculiar to him&s;elf; for he can &s;eldom &s;pend a day, without being led to inform the ignorant, to comfort the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, to confirm the wavering, to cultivate the &s;eeds of goodne&s;s in the minds of men. Such employment is certainly fit to melt the heart into love, and to make it to overflow, in &s;treams of good-will to the whole human race.&mdash;When this author repre&s;ented the clergy as a &s;eparate body, wholly unconnected with &s;ociety, I am apt to think, that he had in his eye only one &s;et of clergymen, tho&s;e prie&s;ts, whom the law of celibacy, and a mona&s;tic life cut off from all the ordinary relations to mankind. Indeed they are &s;carce a part of &s;ociety, they have an <HI>independent</HI> intere&s;t, by which they are firmly united among them&s;elves, by which they are often prompted to con&s;pire in oppo&s;ing the intere&s;t of &s;ociety, and for promoting which their religion is evidently framed. But is it fair to a&s;cribe a character, which &s;prings from <HI>peculiarities</HI> in their &s;ituation, to clergymen of other pro|fe&s;&s;ions, who are joined with &s;ociety by all the &s;ame tender cha|rities, with other men? To &s;peak the truth, by means of the&s;e, the intere&s;t of individual clergymen is &s;o much interwoven with that of the re&s;t of mankind, that they are in con&s;iderable danger of bearing too <HI>little</HI> regard to the members of their own body, and of becoming the tools of the laity in promoting de|&s;igns, which a concern for the intere&s;ts of their own &s;ociety <HI>ought</HI> to urge them to oppo&s;e.</P>

But indeed a &s;pirit of bitter zeal has not been peculiar to the clergy; it has infected all ranks among the laity, in al|mo&s;t every age of the chri&s;tian church. What has been the cau&s;e of this? And does not it affect the credit of the go&s;pel it&s;elf?&mdash;In order to an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions, we may ob|&s;erve, that chri&s;tianity, as it is exhibited in the &s;criptures, is a &s;y&s;tem, not of curious &s;peculations, or intricate di&s;putes, but of plain and &s;imple facts, fit to affect the heart and influence the practice. It is propo&s;ed, not with a view to exerci&s;e the ingenuity of men, but expre&s;ly as <HI>a doctrine according to godli|ne&s;s</HI>; and it is repre&s;ented in that manner, which fits it mo&s;t for promoting this important end. As the principles of com|mon &s;en&s;e, which the powerful hand of the God of nature has impre&s;&s;ed indelibly upon the human &s;oul, influence the ac|tions of tho&s;e, who have never made them an object of refle|ction or enquiry, in ordinary life; &s;o the principles of true reli|gion, which the &s;ame God has revealed in the go&s;pel, firmly embraced and thorowly dige&s;ted, will exert their full force up|on the religious and moral conduct of tho&s;e, who are noways qualified to an&s;wer all the difficulties, or even to comprehend all the ab&s;tru&s;e que&s;tions, that may be rai&s;ed in relation to them. But men are prone to refinement on every &s;ubject, to nice di&s;qui&s;itions concerning the manner of things, and to contentions with tho&s;e who receive not their theories, or ad|vance others repugnant to them. Even the mo&s;t obvious and irre&s;i&s;tible dictates of common &s;en&s;e have been called in que&s;ti|on by the &s;ubtlety of philo&s;ophers; and, had nature left it in our power not to act upon them, till the&s;e di&s;putes were de|termined, the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary functions of life would have been &s;u&s;pended, and immediate ruin would have en&s;ued. Now, brethren, the chri&s;tian religion has been treated like every thing el&s;e; it has been made a &s;ubject of endle&s;s cavil and di|&s;putation. Men have &s;et them&s;elves to refine upon its &s;imple tenets; and, in&s;tead of repre&s;enting it in a manner fit to ope|rate upon the principles of action, they have reduced theology to a &s;y&s;tem of &s;ubtle controver&s;ies. We are &s;o prone to di&s;pu|tation,
<PB N="62" REF="63">
that the greate&s;t ignorance, to which mankind can be reduced, does not prevent it altogether. But the introduction of this evil into religion was immen&s;ely forwarded by the uni|ver&s;al authority, obtained by that &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy, which <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> had e&s;tabli&s;hed, in declared oppo&s;ition to all his prede|ce&s;&s;ors, and which, in conformity to the &s;pirit of its author, was wholly calculated for wrangling and altercation, and ab&s;o|lutely untolerating to all who oppo&s;ed it. The &s;pirit of this fal&s;e philo&s;ophy diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over religion, as well as over every o|ther &s;ubject, filled it with innumerable &s;ubtle que&s;tions, and, by this means, rendered it unfit to influence the practice: for the manner of repre&s;enting any doctrine, with a view to guard it &s;tudiou&s;ly again&s;t the cavils of adver&s;aries, will ever be very different from the manner, in which it mu&s;t be repre&s;ented, in order to move the heart. A &s;y&s;tem of principles of any kind, which &s;pends it&s;elf in di&s;putes, mu&s;t be barren of works, and u&s;ele&s;s with re&s;pect to practice.

Thus chri&s;tianity has been perverted, by a fal&s;e philo&s;ophy, from its real nature and de&s;ign; and from this perve &s;ion have ari&s;en religious heats and animo&s;ities, and a bitter and per&s;e|cuting &s;pirit.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tles fore&s;aw this depravation of religion, and put both mini&s;ters and people on their guard again&s;t it, warning them to <HI>beware, le&s;t any man</HI> &s;hould <HI>&s;poil</HI> them <HI>thro philo&s;ophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chri&s;t</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 8.</NOTE>; not to <HI>give heed to fables, which mini&s;ter que&s;tions rather than godly edifying</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 1. 4.</NOTE>; to <HI>avoid fooli&s;h and unlearned que&s;tions, knowing that they engender &s;trifes and contentions,</HI> and <HI>are unprofitable and vain</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 23.

<HI>di&s;putings of men of corrupt minds</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 3, 4.</NOTE>. But chri&s;tians have not been &s;o wi&s;e as to regard the&s;e warnings. They have deviated from the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, they have corrupted it, into a di&s;putatious theology, by foreign mixtures; and hence male|volent pa&s;&s;ions have ari&s;en. But can they be imputed to the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, when they have been introduced by men's contradicting its &s;pirit? Can we be infected with them by teaching the go&s;pel, when their cau&s;e is plainly teaching &s;ome|thing el&s;e, in&s;tead of the go&s;pel? They are a gro&s;s abu&s;e of the go&s;pel. But there is nothing incapable of being abu&s;ed. They have been very frequent in the chri&s;tian church. Per|haps God permitted them, for the exerci&s;e and probation of chri&s;tians, that, as they have much greater advantages than o|ther men, they might likewi&s;e have &s;ome peculiar temptati|ons.&mdash;When <HI>religious</HI> di&s;putes ari&s;e, they will naturally be managed with greater warmth, than que&s;tions on other &s;ub|jects, by rea&s;on of their &s;uperior importance, and the convicti|on of each party that their &s;entiments alone are agreeable to the will of God. But this warmth will not be peculiar to the clergy; the people will engage in the di&s;pute with equal acri|mony. If there be in&s;tances, in which the clergy have inflamed the people, it is certain too, that, in &s;ome in&s;tances, the clergy have been urged to fiery zeal, by the art of de&s;igning laymen; and that, in &s;ome in&s;tances, they have laboured to curb the fu|ry, and to cure the bigotry of the people, by illu&s;trating and enforcing the principles of toleration and free enquiry. Nay, uncommon ardor &s;eizes not the friends of religion alone, in que&s;tions where it is concerned, but the oppo&s;ers of religion likewi&s;e. Warmed with the moment of the &s;ubject, they too urge their arguments without a &s;trict regard to the rules of modera|tion. Is not the author, to whom we have &s;o often referred, an example of it? Would he have rea&s;oned on any other &s;ubject, in the manner, in which he has rea&s;oned concerning the cha|racter of the mini&s;ters of religion? Had he been perfectly free
<PB N="64" REF="65">
from that zeal, which he imputes to us, and from the preju|dice, which it occa&s;ions, I am per&s;uaded, that his benevolence of heart would have rejected with indignation the general re|flexions, which he has thrown out again&s;t the clergy, and that his &s;trength of under&s;tanding would have enabled him to per|ceive, that they prove nothing to the di&s;advantage of the pa&s;|toral office, or of the chri&s;tian religion. Wrong-turned zeal has &s;ometimes excited the clergy to call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;ecular arm for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of their antagoni&s;ts; is not this author, do you think, under the influence of &s;ome degree of the &s;ame &s;pirit, when, in imitation of their conduct, he endea|vours to alarm &s;ociety again&s;t the attempts of the body of the clergy, as nece&s;&s;arily factious, ambitious and per&s;ecuting?&mdash;Thus the <HI>odium theologicum</HI> is not peculiar to prie&s;ts, it ari&s;es not from the particular genius of their calling, the corrupt pa&s;&s;ions of all men often take occa&s;ion, from the importance of religion, to inflame it, in que&s;tions where religion is anyways concerned. Fully convinced of the truth of their own opinions, they are too apt to indulge intemperate zeal, under the ap|pearance of the love of truth.&mdash;But have clergymen no temp|tations to this vice from which other men are free? Perhaps they have. If religion be already perverted, if the credit of pe|culiar tenets be &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of the intere&s;ts of reli|gion, which always coincide with the intere&s;ts of virtue; they will, in that &s;ituation, but only in that, have a temptation to &s;upport their peculiar tenets with intemperate zeal, becau&s;e their own credit and their livelihood will depend upon the be|lief, which their opinions meet with. But could either depend &s;o much on this, if the people were not fired with a bigotted attachment to certain peculiar tenets, and di&s;po&s;ed to de&s;ert or per&s;ecute their teachers, when they differ from them? Into the corruption of the people, therefore, that temptation mu&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be ultimately re&s;olved, which, on a &s;uperfi|cial view, &s;eems to ari&s;e from the pa&s;toral office. In truth, re|ligion is fir&s;t corrupted thro the weakne&s;s or wickedne&s;s of men; this corruption enters into the characters of all who profe&s;s it;
<PB N="65" REF="66">
both together pervert the pa&s;toral office from its genuine &s;pi|rit; and the perver&s;ion of it increa&s;es that corruption from which it &s;prung.&mdash;If a man enter into the pa&s;toral of|fice &s;ired with a &s;pirit of di&s;putation or wrong-turned zeal, the fault is chargeable only on his natural temper or his edu|cation. But if he enter into it without this &s;pirit, the office will give him &s;ome advantages for avoiding it. It is acknow|leged that, in other &s;ubjects, an acquaintance with the vari|ous opinions of learned men, and with the arguments by which each &s;upports his own, tends to &s;ecure a man from unrea&s;onable dogmati&s;m. If it has the &s;ame tendency in religion, a clergy|man mu&s;t have an inducement to moderation, from his office. His office leads him al&s;o to &s;tudy the &s;criptures, in which meek|ne&s;s and all the kindred virtues are enforced by every method, by examples, by precepts, by promi&s;es, and their oppo&s;ite vi|ces are expo&s;ed, prohibited, and &s;everely threaten'd: and this &s;urely has &s;ome tendency to &s;weeten the temper and humanize the heart.&mdash;In a word, my brethren, a &s;pirit of bitter zeal &s;prings not from religion, nor from the office of the teach|ers of religion, but from a corruption of both; from a corrup|tion, however, to which human nature is &s;o prone, that it will require the greate&s;t vigilance, both of mini&s;ters, and of the people, to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from its infection.</P>
<P>I HOPE it is by this time evident, that this author has ha&s;tily thrown off a portrait for the mini&s;ters of religion, which does, by no means, expre&s;s their genuine features; and that the charge, which he brings again&s;t the &s;pirit of our office, has been rendered in any degree plau&s;ible, only by fixing on &s;ome &s;eparate circum&s;tances of our profe&s;&s;ion, by omitting &s;ome of their mo&s;t natural effects upon the character, and by exagge|rating the re&s;t; nay by a&s;cribing circum&s;tances to our office, which are not only foreign, but even repugnant to it; by con|founding the temptations, which may ari&s;e from the corrup|tions of it or of the go&s;pel, with the direct and e&s;&s;ential ten|dency of both; and by comparing the highe&s;t degree of the
<PB N="66" REF="67">
vices, to which the&s;e temptations may &s;ollicit us, with the low|e&s;t degree of the vices, into which other men may be led by their particular &s;ituation. If the vices, to which clergymen are mo&s;t expo&s;ed, be compared with the &s;ame degree of the vices to which men of other profe&s;&s;ions are liable, the former will not appear to be more odious than the latter. It cannot be pretended that the peculiar temptations of the pa&s;toral office are more generally complied with, than the common temptati|ons of our earthly &s;tate or the peculiar temptations of other pro|fe&s;&s;ions. There is, therefore, no rea&s;on for repre&s;enting the character of the clergy as peculiarly di&s;agreeable in compari|&s;on with other characters. There is &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on for cen|&s;uring the &s;pirit of our office, or the go&s;pel, by which it is in|&s;tituted. In the preceeding enquiry, we have not di&s;&s;embled any real temptation to the vices charged upon us, which can ari&s;e from our profe&s;&s;ion. But it has appeared that, whatever the&s;e temptations be, they ari&s;e from it only <HI>&s;econdarily</HI> and <HI>indirectly</HI>; from the corruptions of our office, not from the office it&s;elf, who&s;e <HI>primary</HI> and <HI>prevailing</HI> tendency is only to virtue. It has appeared, that, if our functions be performed aright, they will naturally and &s;trongly promote &s;incere and manly piety, completed by univer&s;al virtue; and will lead to warm and diffu&s;ive benevolence, fit not only to check all angry pa&s;&s;ions, and all de&s;igns hurtful to mankind, but to prompt us likewi&s;e to uninterrupted a&s;&s;iduity in producing the happine&s;s of others, by in&s;tilling the mo&s;t important know|lege, and recommending the pure&s;t virtue.</P>
<P>IF this be the character, which the mini&s;terial office tends to form in the &s;everal individuals of our &s;ociety, it will be un|nece&s;&s;ary to prove, by any additional arguments, that no go|vernment can have rea&s;on to dread the attempts of the &s;ociety it&s;elf, while its members retain the true &s;pirit of their profe&s;&s;i|on. As long as they are actuated by it, they mu&s;t agree in con&s;idering all mankind as united into one great &s;ociety, un|der the &s;upreme government of God, and in regarding them|&s;elves
<PB N="67" REF="68">
as members of this &s;y&s;tem, connected with all the parts of it, employed to promote the order, and enforce the laws of this mo&s;t ancient and univer&s;al polity, by doing their utmo&s;t to render all, to whom their influence can reach, wi&s;e and virtu|ous and happy. They mu&s;t totally apo&s;tatize from this &s;pirit, before they can form them&s;elves into a <HI>faction,</HI> eager to e&s;ta|bli&s;h any &s;eparate intere&s;t, any intere&s;t di&s;tinct from that of truth, goodne&s;s, and mankind. They mu&s;t contract a &s;pirit <HI>op|po&s;ite</HI> to that, which re&s;ults from the <HI>true</HI> genius of their call|ing, before they can concur in giving &s;cope to <HI>ambition, pride,</HI> or a <HI>per&s;ecuting &s;pirit.</HI> Society can have no rea&s;on to be more jealous of their attempts, than of the attempts of every other cla&s;s of men; for they are not more apt to degenerate from the virtuous &s;pirit of their profe&s;&s;ion, and to promote faction or per&s;ecution, than other men are to become vicious, and to form de&s;igns, and pur&s;ue mea&s;ures, equally de&s;tructive of the peace and order of civil government. A peculiar jealou&s;y of the clergy, and a de&s;ire to depre&s;s them will always indicate a prevailing corruption of manners, a di&s;affection to religion, an indifference about the practice of real virtue, and about the e|ternal happine&s;s of mankind, in the &s;ocieties or individuals, who entertain that jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>IT was remarked, in the beginning of this di&s;cour&s;e, that the enquiry, which we propo&s;ed for the &s;ubject of it, is of a very practical nature. It &s;ugge&s;ts important in&s;tructions, both to <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> and to the <HI>people.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. EVERY part of the inve&s;tigation, now attempted, forces reflections into our view, which merit the attention of all the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel.

<P>THE <HI>office of a bi&s;hop</HI> is, indeed, <HI>a good,</HI> a worthy <HI>work</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">chap. iii. 1.</NOTE>. It has the &s;tronge&s;t tendency to adorn the characters of tho&s;e, who exerci&s;e it, with univer&s;al holine&s;s, the true beauty, the only excellence of the human &s;oul. It gives us the noble&s;t op|portunities of &s;aving our&s;elves, by doing all that we can to promote the &s;alvation of others. The advantages which we en|joy, demand from us the pure&s;t and the &s;ublime&s;t virtue. The voice of mankind, the nature of our office, the credit of our re|ligion call upon us to guard carefully again&s;t every &s;in, and to &s;tudy to excell others in every amiable quality. In gratitude, in duty, in intere&s;t, in honour, by every po&s;&s;ible tie, we are in|di&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to be <HI>blamele&s;s,</HI> to have our &s;ouls deeply tinctured with all real goodne&s;s, and to render our whole lives an uninterrupted &s;eries of con&s;picuous holine&s;s. Every degree of vice in us is &s;ingularly atrocious, not only in the opinion of the world, but in the eye of unbia&s;&s;ed rea&s;on, and in the uner|ring judgment of God; and will be puni&s;hed with the greate&s;t &s;everity: and what would be e&s;teemed only a defect of virtue in others, will ever be accounted a po&s;itive and heinous vice in us. In vain &s;hall any mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel expect to derive e&s;teem from the dignity of his calling, if he do not walk wor|thy of it. Its dignity ari&s;es from its holine&s;s. A vicious mi|ni&s;ter will deba&s;e it more, in the opinion of the world, than all the groundle&s;s cen&s;ures of its enemies. Nay, brethren, to our vices their reflexions may ju&s;tly be imputed; for our vices alone put it in their power to cen&s;ure the genius of our pro|fe&s;&s;ion, to revile our order, or to bla&s;pheme the go&s;pel for our &s;akes; our vices alone di&s;po&s;e mankind to li&s;ten, in any de|gree, to their a&s;per&s;ions, or hinder them from rejecting them with indignation.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="70">
BY improving the advantages, which our occupation gives us, we may, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, which will never be wanting to us but thro our own fault, attain the highe&s;t de|gree of virtue: but by mi&s;improving them, we &s;hall &s;ink into the lowe&s;t degeneracy. As meat, which is extremely nouri&s;h|ing to the healthful, may inflame dangerous di&s;tempers in the weak, &s;o advantages for cultivating virtue, which have the mo&s;t powerful influence on the well-di&s;po&s;ed, will contribute to harden the wicked in their vices. The danger of our fal|ling &s;hort of that exalted virtue, which our advantages render indi&s;pen&s;ible, and the danger of our peri&s;hing for ever, which will nece&s;&s;arily &s;pring from our falling &s;hort of it, have ap|peared &s;o great to many pious per&s;ons of our pro&s;e&s;&s;ion, that they have not &s;crupled to expre&s;s their fears, that a &s;maller proportion of our order, than of other ranks of men, &s;hall ob|tain &s;alvation. Certainly, we cannot be too careful to impre&s;s upon our&s;elves the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of both the&s;e dangers, which the &s;trictne&s;s of our obligations and our &s;ignal advantages ren|der very great. It is infinitely hazardous for a vicious man to enter into the pa&s;toral office; it is infinitely hazardous for us to neglect the immediate application of its advantages to the improvement of our own hearts; for, if the peculiar means of holine&s;s, which it affords, do not very quickly excite the mini|&s;ters of the go&s;pel to virtue, there is &s;carce a chance for their reformation. Where can they find means of reformation, more efficacious than tho&s;e, with which they have already refu&s;ed to comply? It is of great importance, that every per&s;on, who a&s;pires to this &s;acred office, &s;hould devote him&s;elf early to pie|ty and virtue, that he may be qualified to improve its opportu|nities, and to avoid its dangers. It is of everla&s;ting importance to his own &s;oul. Every man, who finds him&s;elf de&s;titute of the &s;eeds of exalted and uniform goodne&s;s, ought to relinqui&s;h all thoughts of engaging in a profe&s;&s;ion, to which his vices, of whatever kind they are, will be a reproach and ignominy. Whoever has entered into the pa&s;toral office ought to give up
<PB N="70" REF="71">
him&s;elf to the practice of its duties, and, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to confine him&s;elf to them, that he may not lo&s;e the advantages for cultivating virtue, which this office puts in his power. He ought to be extremely attentive to the manner, in which he exerci&s;es his &s;acred functions, that he may avoid the heinous vice, which will infallibly ari&s;e from the negligent or the im|proper exerci&s;e of them, and attain that improvement of heart, which will be promoted by the diligent and right performance of the duties of his holy calling.</P>
<P>SOME vices, as intemperance, impiety, exce&s;&s;ive di&s;&s;ipati|on, are &s;o un&s;uitable to our profe&s;&s;ion, that they will be indulg|ed only by the abandoned; they demon&s;trate a total deprava|tion of heart, a mind lo&s;t to all the principles of goodne&s;s. In the mo&s;t degenerate &s;tate of things, the&s;e vices will not be ve|ry frequent in our &s;ociety; the lea&s;t approach to them is uni|ver&s;ally reckoned &s;candalous. We &s;hould guard again&s;t the&s;e, becau&s;e they will infallibly render our characters odious, and all our labours u&s;ele&s;s. However &s;lightly they may be di&s;ap|proved in others, let us remember, not only that they are highly blameable in their own nature, but al&s;o that the world will ever regard them with indignation in a clergyman, that even the perverted judgment of tho&s;e, who practi&s;e them, will pronounce them dete&s;tible in him, that even they, who &s;ollicit him to commit them, and &s;eem to like his gaiety, will de&s;pi&s;e him in their hearts. Let not the example or corrupted &s;enti|ments of the world, let not an affectation of &s;pirit and free|dom, let not the fear of being reckoned au&s;tere, moro&s;e, or &s;tubborn, let not any inducement prevail with us to admit the lowe&s;t degree of the&s;e vices into our character or practice. The virtues oppo&s;ite to the&s;e are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve us from univer&s;al infamy; let us take care that we have not the appearance of them only, but that we really po&s;&s;e&s;s the virtues them&s;elves, and excell in them. They are enforced upon us by the &s;pirit of our profe&s;&s;ion in its full &s;trength; they are in|culcated by <HI>all</HI> the moral principles, by which our employment operates on the temper.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="72">
THERE are &s;ome other vices, which have not &s;o <HI>manife&s;t</HI> a repugnance to our profe&s;&s;ion, or which may even appear to &s;pring from a common and probable abu&s;e of it. But for that very rea&s;on, we have greater need to be upon our guard again&s;t them. Intemperate zeal, and its kindred vices will in&s;inuate them&s;elves more imperceptibly than tho&s;e which were mention|ed before, will di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves more artfully, will more ea&s;ily elude the ob&s;ervation of the ignorant, or, perhaps, will be even con&s;ecrated by them. In general the vices, which we are in greate&s;t danger of indulging, are tho&s;e which admit of the faire&s;t pretexts, and which are mo&s;t apt to be confounded with &s;ome virtuous principle; our profe&s;&s;ion does not afford all the motives to ab&s;tinence from the&s;e, which it affords to ab&s;ti|nence from other vices, tho it affords all that their nature will allow. If we attend to the exhortations, which the in&s;pired writers addre&s;s to mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, we &s;hall find that they much oftener give us warning again&s;t the vices of this cla&s;s, than again&s;t others; thus plainly intimating that we are obnoxious chiefly to the&s;e. To avoid every degree of the&s;e will require the greate&s;t circum&s;pection. The&s;e will be more frequent in our &s;ociety, than other vices. The&s;e alone can, with any <HI>plau&s;ibility,</HI> be charged on the &s;pirit of our office. If we indulge our&s;elves in the&s;e, their prevalence will furni&s;h our more di&s;cerning enemies with the mo&s;t &s;pecious arguments a|gain&s;t us. In&s;tead of entertaining re&s;entment again&s;t them, let us turn their cen&s;ures to our own advantage. The mini&s;terial office has not &s;uch a tendency to any vice, as can ju&s;tly expo&s;e its &s;pirit to reproach; but the vices, which are imputed to it, may notwith&s;tanding be tho&s;e, which a wicked or a carele&s;s mi|ni&s;ter will mo&s;t probably indulge. Let us not be &s;atisfied with a conviction, that our <HI>office</HI> does not de&s;erve cen&s;ure; but let every individual take care, that <HI>he</HI> may not de&s;erve it. Adver|&s;aries of penetration will be &s;ure to attack us on the &s;ide, where we are weake&s;t. Let us take warning; let us employ particu|lar attention there; let us beware of every thing, that can lead
<PB N="72" REF="73">
us into the vices, which they impute to us. Our office has its peculiar temptations; let us not di&s;gui&s;e them from our&s;elves; let us rather be &s;ollicitous to di&s;cover them: they cannot reflect di&s;honour on that office, or on religion; yet they may &s;ome|times put our virtue to a very difficult and hazardous trial; they will overcome us, and &s;educe us into vice, if we be not vi|gilant and circum&s;pect. But, if thro the grace of God, whom we &s;erve in the go&s;pel, we &s;trenuou&s;ly re&s;i&s;t them, we &s;hall ac|quire &s;trong habits of &s;incere piety, unfeigned humility, diffu|&s;ive benevolence, meekne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, charity, and every a|miable virtue, which can adorn our &s;tation, or our religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE enquiry, in which we have been engaged, like|wi&s;e &s;ugge&s;ts u&s;eful in&s;tructions to the laity.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent age, and in this nation, infidelity has erected its &s;tandard, and many have enli&s;ted in its &s;ervice. If there be any among the&s;e, who think that they have rejected the go&s;pel, after a fair examination of its evidences, we will pray fervently to God, that he may have mercy upon them, and bring them <HI>to the knowlege of the truth</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 4.</NOTE>. We will be&s;eech them, for their own &s;akes, to take care that they have been really <HI>unprejudiced</HI> in their enquiries. Prejudices <HI>again&s;t</HI> reli|gion may in&s;inuate them&s;elves as imperceptibly, as prejudices <HI>for</HI> it; and they are, at lea&s;t, as highly blameable. If God has really given a revelation of his will to mankind, every degree of unfairne&s;s in examining its evidence, will be highly vicious in the judgment of rea&s;on and natural con&s;cience, and will evidently de&s;erve the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment. But, without pretending to judge of mens &s;ecret intentions, we may &s;urely &s;ay that, when men attack religion, either in public or pri|vate, either in conver&s;ation or from the pre&s;s, by throwing out undi&s;tingui&s;hed reflexions again&s;t the clergy; when they exaggerate the failings of individual clergymen, and charge them on the whole body; when they attempt to reproach

the &s;pirit of the mini&s;terial office, by partial or wrong repre|&s;entations of its nature; when they labour to overturn religi|on, by rai&s;ing a groundle&s;s prejudice again&s;t the teachers of it; this affords a pre&s;umption of prejudice, tho perhaps un|&s;u&s;pected by them&s;elves, which, when it is pointed out to them, may ju&s;tly excite them to review the temper and care, with which they have enquired into religion. If an infidel be not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with blameable prejudice, he will certainly confine him&s;elf, in his attacks again&s;t religion, to direct argu|ments, carefully avoiding every topic, which may weaken its <HI>influence,</HI> without deciding concerning its <HI>truth.</HI> Let illiberal reflexions again&s;t the clergy be left to the tribe of <HI>vulgar</HI> infi|dels, who have not perhaps penetration enough to di&s;cover, that they do not amount to a full confutation of chri&s;tianity. Let tho&s;e ab&s;tain from them, who are capable of perceiving, that many mini&s;ters may be extremely vicious, and yet the of|fice, which they hold, may have a virtuous tendency, and the go&s;pel may be true.</P>
<P>MY &s;ubject leads me al&s;o to addre&s;s the <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> people. It leads me to warn you, my friends, not to allow any man to <HI>beguile you with enticing words, by &s;light and cunning craftine&s;s, whereby many lie in wait to deceive</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 4. Eph. iv. 14.</NOTE>. It leads me to <HI>exhort you that ye &s;hould earne&s;tly contend for the faith, which was once deliver|ed unto the &s;aints; for there are</HI> many <HI>crept</HI> into chri&s;tian coun|tries, who <HI>deny the only Lord God, and our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Jude. 3, 4.</NOTE>. Let not example, let not inconclu&s;ive cavils, let not un&s;ub&s;tan|tial turns of wit prevail with you to <HI>deny the Lord that bought</HI> you<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. ii. 1.</NOTE>, in oppo&s;ition to your rational conviction. You may adopt &s;ome of the maxims of infidels, without perceiving their con&s;equences; you may be infected with their <HI>&s;pirit.</HI> while you reject their <HI>principles.</HI> This is &s;hameful incon&s;i&s;tence; but e|very day's experience evinces that men may fall into it. Infi|dels have no prejudice again&s;t mini&s;ters of go&s;pel, except on

account of their being the teachers of chri&s;tianity; they re|proach <HI>them,</HI> only that they may wound <HI>religion.</HI> But do not &s;ome of you join in de&s;pi&s;ing, ridiculing, or reproaching the chri&s;ti|an <HI>mini&s;try,</HI> tho you acknowlege the truth of the chri&s;tian <HI>religi|on?</HI> The conduct of infidels is extremely fooli&s;h, becau&s;e their rea&s;oning is evidently fallacious. But your conduct is infinite|ly more ab&s;urd; you promote the de&s;igns of unbelievers again&s;t your&s;elves; you incon&s;iderately contribute to the &s;ucce&s;s of a cau&s;e, which you abhor. It has been often ob&s;erved, that mo|dern dei&s;ts have derived from tho&s;e very &s;criptures, which they reject, ju&s;ter opinions in natural religion, than the wi&s;e&s;t hea|thens were able to form, by una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on, and that the go&s;|pel has thus in&s;en&s;ibly refined the principles even of its ene|mies. But it may be ob&s;erved with equal truth, that the pre|valence of infidelity has greatly corrupted the <HI>&s;entiments</HI> and <HI>practice</HI> even of tho&s;e, who&s;e <HI>faith</HI> it could not directly &s;ubvert. Be on your guard, therefore, again&s;t the contagion of its &s;pirit.&mdash;Indeed, you have a right to expect exemplary holine&s;s from your mini&s;ters; vice in them may ju&s;tly excite your in|dignation; and your expre&s;&s;ing your di&s;approbation of it, in every proper manner, may prevent it from becoming frequent. Be &s;ure however, to find fault only with real vices. Confine your cen&s;ures to the individuals, who are guilty. In your cen|&s;ures, even of them, remember &s;till, that they are weak and fal|lible creatures like your&s;elves, expo&s;ed to all the temptations of this &s;tate of trial. But let not the faults of a few be imput|ed to all. Do not, on account of them, de&s;pi&s;e or reproach the office. Blame vicious mini&s;ters for behaving <HI>un&s;uitably</HI> to their profe&s;&s;ion; but remember, that this very judgment implies the <HI>excellence</HI> of that profe&s;&s;ion. While you believe the go&s;pel, you ought to pre&s;erve a high regard for the office of teaching it; you ought to <HI>e&s;teem</HI> tho&s;e, who are employed in it, <HI>very highly in love for their work's &s;ake,</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. v. 13.</NOTE>. If you de&s;pi&s;e the <HI>order</HI> in ge|neral, you de&s;pi&s;e their <HI>work,</HI> you de&s;pi&s;e the <HI>go&s;pel</HI>; for the

<P>YOU, brethren, as well as mini&s;ters, enjoy great advanta|ges for the practice of holine&s;s, by the go&s;pel. Your obliga|tions and your dangers are very &s;imilar to ours. It is your bu|&s;ine&s;s to &s;tudy and to practi&s;e that religion, which it is our bu|&s;ine&s;s to teach and inculcate on you. Let your &s;en&s;e of the ad|vantages, which it affords, animate you to blamele&s;s holine&s;s. Let your &s;en&s;e of the danger of your mi&s;improving the&s;e ad|vantages excite your vigilance and caution.
