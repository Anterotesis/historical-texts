<P>MR. POPE, in his la&s;t illne&s;s, amu&s;ed him&s;elf, amid&s;t the care of his higher concerns, in preparing a corrected and complete Edition of his Writings<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">&mdash;"I own the late encroachments upon my con|&s;titution make me willing to &s;ee the end of all further care about me or my works. I would re&s;t for the one in a full re&s;ignation of my Being to be di&s;po&s;ed of by the Father of all Mercy; and for the other (though indeed a trifle, yet a trifle may be &s;ome ex|ample) I would commit them to the candour of a &s;en|&s;ible and reflecting judge, rather than to the malice of every &s;hort-&s;ighted and malevolent critic, or inad|vertent and cen&s;orious Reader. And no hand can &s;et them in &s;o good a light, &amp;c." <BIBL>Let. <HI>cxx.</HI> to Mr. W.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>; and, with his u&s;ual delicacy, was even &s;o|licitous to prevent any &s;hare of the offence they might occa&s;ion, from falling on the Friend whom he had engaged to give them to the Public<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">&mdash;"I al&s;o give and bequeath to the &s;aid Mr. War|burton, the property of all &s;uch of my Works already printed as he hath written or &s;hall write Commenta|ries or Notes upon, and which I have not otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of or alienated; and as he &s;hall publi&s;h WITHOUT FUTURE ALTERATIONS."&mdash;<BIBL>His la&s;t Will and Te&s;tament.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="11">
In di&s;charge of this tru&s;t, the Public has here a complete Edition of his Works; ex|ecuted in &s;uch a manner, as, I am per&s;uad|ed, would have been to his &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The Editor hath not, for the &s;ake of profit, &s;uffered the Author's Name to be made cheap by a <HI>Sub&s;cription;</HI> nor his Works to be defrauded of their due Ho|nours by a vulgar or inelegant Impre&s;&s;ion; nor his memory to be di&s;graced by any pieces unworthy of his talents or virtue. On the contrary, he hath, at a very great expen&s;e, ornamented this Edition with all the advantages which the be&s;t Arti&s;ts in Paper, Printing, and Sculpture could be|&s;tow upon it.</P>
<P>If the Public hath waited longer than the deference due to it &s;hould have &s;uf|fered, it was owing to a rea&s;on which the Editor need not make a &s;ecret. It was his regard to the family-intere&s;ts of his de|cea&s;ed Friend. Mr. Pope, at his death, left large impre&s;&s;ions of &s;everal parts of his Works, un&s;old; the property of which was adjudged to belong to his Execu|tors; and the Editor was willing they &s;hould have time to di&s;po&s;e of them to the
<PB N="v" REF="12">
be&s;t advantage, before the publication of this Edition (which hath been long pre|pared) &s;hould put a &s;top to the &s;ale.</P>
<P>But it may be proper to be a little more particular concerning the &s;uperiority of this Edition above all the preceding; &s;o far as Mr. Pope him&s;elf was concerned. What the Editor hath done, the Reader mu&s;t collect for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The FIRST Volume, and the original poems in the SECOND, are here printed from a copy corrected throughout by the Author him&s;elf, even to the very preface: Which, with &s;everal additional notes in his own hand, he delivered to the Editor a little before his death. The Juvenile tran&s;lations, in the other part of the SE|COND Volume, it was never his inten|tion to bring into this Edition of his Works, on account of the levity of &s;ome, the freedom of others, and the little im|portance of any. But the&s;e being the pro|perty of other men, the Editor had it not in his power to follow the Author's in|tention.</P>
<P>The THIRD Volume, all but the <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Man</HI> (which, together with the <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="13">
<HI>on Critici&s;m,</HI> The Author, a little before his death, had corrected and publi&s;hed in Quarto, as a &s;pecimen of his projected Edi|tion) was printed by him in his la&s;t ill|ne&s;s (but never publi&s;hed) in the manner it is now given. The di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Epi|&s;tle on the Characters of Men</HI> is quite al|tered; <HI>that</HI> on the <HI>Characters of Women,</HI> much enlarged; and the <HI>Epi&s;tles on Riches and Ta&s;te</HI> corrected and improved. To the&s;e advantages of the THIRD Volume, mu&s;t be added a great number of fine ver&s;es taken from the Author's Manu&s;cript-copies of the&s;e poems, communicated by him for this purpo&s;e to the Editor. The&s;e, when he fir&s;t publi&s;hed the poems to which they belong, he thought proper, for va|rious rea&s;ons, to omit. Some from the Ma|nu&s;cript-copy of the <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Man,</HI> which tended to di&s;credit <HI>fate,</HI> and to recom|mend the <HI>moral government</HI> of God, had, by the Editor's advice, been re&s;tored to their places in the la&s;t Edition of that Poem. The re&s;t, together with others of the like &s;ort from his Manu&s;cript-copy of the other <HI>Ethic Epi&s;tles,</HI> are here in&s;erted
<PB N="vii" REF="14">
at the bottom of the page, under the title of <HI>Variations.</HI></P>
<P>The FOURTH Volume contains the <HI>Sa|tires;</HI> with their <HI>Prologue,</HI> the <HI>Epi&s;tle to Dr. Arbuthnot;</HI> and <HI>Epilogue,</HI> the two poems intitled MDCCXXXVIII. The <HI>Pro|logue</HI> and <HI>Epilogue</HI> are here given with the like advantages as the <HI>Ethic Epi&s;tles</HI> in the foregoing Volume, that is to &s;ay, with the <HI>Variations,</HI> or additional ver&s;es from the Author's Manu&s;cripts. The <HI>Epi|logue</HI> to the <HI>Satires</HI> is likewi&s;e inriched with many and large notes now fir&s;t printed from the Author's own Manu&s;cript.</P>
<P>The FIFTH Volume contains a correcter and completer Edition of the <HI>Dunciad</HI> than hath been hitherto publi&s;hed; of which, at pre&s;ent I have only this further to add, That it was at my reque&s;t he laid the plan of a fourth Book. I often told him, It was pity &s;o fine a poem &s;hould re|main di&s;graced by the meanne&s;s of its &s;ub|ject, the mo&s;t <HI>in&s;ignificant</HI> of all Dunces, bad Rymers and malevolent Cavillers: That he ought to rai&s;e and enoble it by pointing his Satire again&s;t the mo&s;t <HI>per|nicious</HI> of all, Minute-philo&s;ophers and
<PB N="viii" REF="15">
Free-thinkers. I imagined, too, it was for the intere&s;ts of Religion to have it known, that &s;o great a Genius had a due abhorrence of the&s;e pe&s;ts of Virtue and Society. He came readily into my opinion; but, at the &s;ame time, told me it would create him many Enemies. He was not mi&s;taken. For tho' the terror of his pen kept them for &s;ome time in re|&s;pect, yet on his death they ro&s;e with un|re&s;trained fury in numerous Coffee-hou&s;e tales, and Grub-&s;treet libels. The plan of this admirable Satire was artfully contrived to &s;hew, that the follies and defects of a fa&s;hionable EDUCATION naturally led to, and nece&s;&s;arily ended in, FREE-THINK|ING; with de&s;ign to point out the only remedy adequate to &s;o fatal an evil. It was to advance the &s;ame ends of virtue and religion, that the Editor prevailed on him to alter every thing in his <HI>moral writings</HI> that might be &s;u&s;pected of hav|ing the lea&s;t glance towards <HI>Fate</HI> or NA|TURALISM; and to add what was proper to convince the world, that he was warm|ly on the &s;ide of <HI>moral Government</HI> and a <HI>revealed Will.</HI> And it would be inju&s;tice
<PB N="ix" REF="16">
to his memory not to declare that he em|braced the&s;e occa&s;ions with the mo&s;t un|feigned plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The SIXTH Volume con&s;i&s;ts of Mr. Pope's mi&s;cellaneous pieces in ver&s;e and pro&s;e. Among&s;t the <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> &s;everal fine poems make now their fir&s;t appearance in his Works. And of the <HI>Pro&s;e,</HI> all that is good, and nothing but what is exqui&s;itely &s;o, will be found in this Edition.</P>
<P>The SEVENTH, EIGHTH, and NINTH Volumes con&s;i&s;t entirely of his <HI>Letters.</HI> The more valuable, as they are the only true models which we, or perhaps any of our neighbours have, of <HI>familiar Epi&s;tles.</HI> This collection is now made more com|plete by the addition of &s;everal new pieces. Yet, excepting a &s;hort explanatory letter to Col. M. and the <HI>Letters</HI> to Mr. A. and Mr. W. (the latter of which are given to &s;hew the Editor's inducements, and the engagements he was under, to intend the care of this Edition) excepting the&s;e, I &s;ay, the re&s;t are all here publi&s;hed from the Author's own printed tho' not pub|li&s;hed, copies delivered to the Editor.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="17">
On the whole, the Advantages of this Edition, above the preceding, are the&s;e, That it is the fir&s;t complete collection which has ever been made of his ori|ginal Writings; That all his principal poems, of early or later date, are here given to the public with his la&s;t corrections and improvements; That a great num|ber of his ver&s;es are here fir&s;t printed from the Manu&s;cript-copies of his principal poems of later date; That many new notes of the Author's are here added to his Poems; and la&s;tly, that &s;everal pieces, both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, make now their fir&s;t appearance before the Public.</P>
<P>The Author's life de&s;erves a ju&s;t Vo|lume; and the Editor intends to give it. For to have been one of the fir&s;t Poets in the world is but his &s;econd prai&s;e. He was in a higher Cla&s;s. He was one of the <HI>noble&s;t works of God.</HI> He was an <HI>hone&s;t Man</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>" A wit's a feather, and a chief's a rod,</L>
<L>" An hone&s;t Man's the noble&s;t work of God.</L></Q></NOTE>. A Man, who alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more real virtue than, in very corrupt times, needing a Satiri&s;t like him, will &s;ometimes fall to the &s;hare of multitudes.
<PB N="xi" REF="18">
In this hi&s;tory of his life<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">It will be printed in the &s;ame form with this and every future edition of his works, &s;o as to make a part of them.</NOTE>, will be con|tained a large account of his <HI>writ|ings;</HI> a critique on the nature, force, and extent of his <HI>genius,</HI> exemplified from the&s;e writings; and a vindication of his <HI>moral character</HI> exemplified by his more di&s;tingui&s;hed virtues; his filial piety, his di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hips, his reverence for the con&s;titution of his country, his love and admiration of VIRTUE, and, (what was the nece&s;&s;ary effect) his hatred and contempt of VICE, his exten&s;ive cha|rity to the indigent, his warm benevo|lence to mankind, his &s;upreme veneration of the Deity, and, above all, his &s;incere belief of Revelation. Nor &s;hall his faults be concealed. It is not for the intere&s;ts of his Virtues that they &s;hould. Nor indeed could they be concealed if we were &s;o minded, for they <HI>&s;hine</HI> thro' his Virtues; no man being more a dupe to the &s;pecious appearances of Virtue in others. In a word I mean not to be his Panegyri&s;t, but his Hi&s;torian. And may I, when Envy
<PB N="xii" REF="19">
and Calumny take the &s;ame advantage of my ab&s;ence (for, while I live, I will freely tru&s;t it to my <HI>Life</HI> to confute them) may I find a Friend as careful of my hone&s;t fame as I have been of His! Together with his Works, he hath bequeathed me his DUNCES. So that as the property is transferred, I could wi&s;h they would now let his memory alone. The veil which Death draws over the Good is &s;o &s;acred, that to throw dirt upon the Shrine &s;can|dalizes even Barbarians. And though Rome permitted her Slaves to calumniate her be&s;t Citizens on the day of Triumph, yet the &s;ame petulancy at their Funeral would have been rewarded with execra|tion and a gibbet.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Am inclined to think that both the writers of books, and the readers of them, are gene|rally not a little unrea&s;onable in their expectations. The fir&s;t &s;eem to fancy that the world mu&s;t ap|prove whatever they produce, and the latter to imagine that authors are obliged to plea&s;e them at any rate. Methinks, as on the one hand, no &s;ingle man is born with a right of controuling the opi|nions of all the re&s;t; &s;o on the other, the world has no title to demand, that the whole care and time of any particular per&s;on &s;hould be &s;acrificed to its entertainment. Therefore I cannot but be|lieve that writers and readers are under equal ob|ligations, for as much fame, or plea&s;ure, as each affords the other.</P>
<P>Every one acknowledges, it would be a wild notion to expect perfection in any work of man: and yet one would think the contrary was taken for granted, by the judgment commonly pa&s;t up|on Poems. A Critic &s;uppo&s;es he has done his part, if he proves a writer to have failed in an expre&s;|&s;ion, or erred in any particular point: and can it then be wondered at, if the Poets in general &s;eem re&s;olved not to own them&s;elves in any error? For
<PB N="ii" REF="23">
as long as one &s;ide will make no allowances, the other will be brought to no acknowledgements<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In the former editions it was thus&mdash;<HI>For as long as one &s;ide de&s;pi&s;es a well meant endeavour, the other will not be &s;atisfied with a moderate approbation.</HI>&mdash;But the Author altered it, as the&s;e words were rather a con&s;equence from the conclu&s;ion he would draw, than the conclu&s;ion it&s;elf, which he has now in|&s;erted.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I am afraid this extreme zeal on both &s;ides is ill-placed; Poetry and Critici&s;m being by no means the univer&s;al concern of the world, but only the affair of idle men who write in their clo|&s;ets, and of idle men who read there.</P>
<P>Yet &s;ure upon the whole, a bad Author de|&s;erves better u&s;age than a bad Critic: for a Writer's endeavour, for the mo&s;t part, is to plea&s;e his Readers, and he fails merely through the mi&s;for|tune of an ill judgment; but &s;uch a Critic's is to put them out of humor; a de&s;ign he could ne|ver go upon without both that and an ill temper.</P>
<P>I think a good deal may be &s;aid to extenuate the fault of bad Poets. What we call a Genius, is hard to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a man him&s;elf, from a &s;trong inclination: and if his genius be ever &s;o great, he cannot at fir&s;t di&s;cover it any other way, than by giving way to that prevalent propen&s;ity which renders him the more liable to be mi&s;taken. The only method he has, is to make the experi|ment by writing, and appealing to the judgment of others: now if he happens to write ill (which is certainly no &s;in in it&s;elf) he is immediately made
<PB N="iii" REF="24">
an object of ridicule. I wi&s;h we had the huma|nity to reflect that even the wor&s;t authors might, in their endeavour to plea&s;e us, de&s;erve &s;omething at our hands. We have no cau&s;e to quarrel with them but for their ob&s;tinacy in per&s;i&s;ting to write; and this too may admit of alleviating circum&s;tances. Their particular friends may be either ignorant, or in&s;incere; and the re&s;t of the world in general is too well bred to &s;hock them with a truth, which generally their Book&s;ellers are the fir&s;t that inform them of. This happens not till they have &s;pent too much of their time, to apply to any profe&s;&s;ion which might better fit their talents; and till &s;uch talents as they have are &s;o far di&s;credited as to be but of &s;mall &s;ervice to them. For (what is the harde&s;t ca&s;e imaginable) the reputation of a man generally depends upon the fir&s;t &s;teps he makes in the world, and people will e&s;tabli&s;h their opinion of us, from what we do at that &s;ea&s;on when we have lea&s;t judgment to direct us.</P>
<P>On the other hand, a good Poet no &s;ooner com|municates his works with the &s;ame de&s;ire of in|formation, but it is imagined he is a vain young creature given up to the ambition of fame; when perhaps the poor man is all the while trembling with the fear of being ridiculous. If he is made to hope he may plea&s;e the world, he falls under very unlucky circum&s;tances: for, from the mo|ment he prints, he mu&s;t expect to hear no more truth, than if he were a Prince, or a Beauty. If

he has not very good &s;en&s;e (and indeed there are twenty men of wit, for one man of &s;en&s;e) his living thus in a cour&s;e of flattery may put him in no &s;mall danger of becoming a Coxcomb: if he has, he will con&s;equently have &s;o much diffidence as not to reap any great &s;atisfaction from his prai&s;e; &s;ince, if it be given to his face, it can &s;carce be di|&s;tingui&s;hed from flattery, and if in his ab&s;ence, it is hard to be certain of it. Were he &s;ure to be commended by the be&s;t and mo&s;t knowing, he is as &s;ure of being envied by the wor&s;t and mo&s;t ig|norant, which are the majority; for it is with a fine Genius as with a fine fa&s;hion, all tho&s;e are di&s;|plea&s;ed at it who are not able to follow it: and it is to be feared that e&s;teem will &s;eldom do any man &s;o much good, as ill-will does him harm. Then there is a third cla&s;s of people who make the large&s;t part of mankind, tho&s;e of ordinary or indifferent capacities; and the&s;e (to a man) will hate, or &s;u&s;pect him: a hundred hone&s;t Gentle|men will dread him as a Wit, and a hundred in|nocent Women as a Satiri&s;t. In a word, what|ever be his fate in Poetry, it is ten to one but he mu&s;t give up all the rea&s;onable aims of life for it. There are indeed &s;ome advantages accruing from a Genius to Poetry, and they are all I can think of: the agreeable power of &s;elf-amu&s;ement when a man is idle or alone; the privilege of being admitted into the be&s;t company; and the free|dom of &s;aying as many carele&s;s things as other
<PB N="v" REF="28">
people, without being &s;o &s;everely remarked up|on.</P>
<P>I believe, if any one, early in his life, &s;hould contemplate the dangerous fate of authors, he would &s;carce be of their number on any con&s;ider|ation. The life of a Wit is a warfare upon earth; and the pre&s;ent &s;pirit of the learned world is &s;uch, that to attempt to &s;erve it (any way) one mu&s;t have the con&s;tancy of a martyr, and a re&s;olution to &s;uffer for its &s;ake. I could wi&s;h people would believe what I am pretty certain they will not, that I have been much le&s;s concerned about Fame than I dur&s;t declare till this occa&s;ion, when me|thinks I &s;hould find more credit than I could here|tofore: &s;ince my writings have had their fate already, and it is too late to think of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the reader in their favour. I would plead it as &s;ome merit in me, that the world has never been prepared for the&s;e Trifles by Prefaces, bya&s;&s;ed by recommendations, dazled with the names of great Patrons, wheedled with fine rea&s;ons and pretences, or troubled with excu&s;es. I confe&s;s it was want of con&s;ideration that made me an author; I writ becau&s;e it amu&s;ed me; I corrected becau&s;e it was as plea&s;ant to me to correct as to write; and I pub|li&s;hed becau&s;e I was told I might plea&s;e &s;uch as it was a credit to plea&s;e. To what degree I have done this, I am really ignorant; I had too much fondne&s;s for my productions to judge of them at fir&s;t, and too much judgment to be plea&s;ed with

them at la&s;t. But I have rea&s;on to think they can have no reputation which will continue long, or which de&s;erves to do &s;o: for they have always fallen &s;hort not only of what I read of others, but even of my own Ideas of Poetry.</P>
<P>If any one &s;hould imagine I am not in earne&s;t, I de&s;ire him to reflect, that the Ancients (to &s;ay the lea&s;t of them) had as much Genius as we: and that to take more pains, and employ more time, cannot fail to produce more complete pieces. They con&s;tantly apply'd them&s;elves not only to that art, but to that &s;ingle branch of an art, to which their talent was mo&s;t powerfully bent; and it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives to correct and fini&s;h their works for po&s;terity. If we can pretend to have u&s;ed the &s;ame indu&s;try, let us expect the &s;ame im|mortality: Tho' if we took the &s;ame care, we &s;hould &s;till lie under a farther misfortune: they writ in languages that became univer&s;al and ever|la&s;ting, while ours are extremely limited both in extent and in duration. A mighty foundation for our pride! when the utmo&s;t we can hope, is but to be read in one I&s;land, and to be thrown a&s;ide at the end of one Age.</P>
<P>All that is left us is to recommend our produc|tions by the imitation of the Ancients: and it will be found true, that, in every age, the highe&s;t cha|racter for &s;en&s;e and learning has been obtain'd by tho&s;e who have been mo&s;t indebted to them. For, to &s;ay truth, whatever is very good &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t
<PB N="vii" REF="30">
have been common &s;en&s;e in all times; and what we call Learning, is but the knowledge of the &s;en&s;e of our predece&s;&s;ors. Therefore they who &s;ay our thoughts are not our own, becau&s;e they re&s;emble the Ancients, may as well &s;ay our faces are not our own, becau&s;e they are like our Fathers: And indeed it is very unrea&s;onable, that people &s;hould expect us to be Scholars, and yet be angry to find us &s;o.</P>
<P>I fairly confe&s;s that I have &s;erv'd my&s;elf all I could by reading; that I made u&s;e of the judg|ment of authors dead and living; that I omitted no means in my power to be inform'd of my er|rors, both by my friends and enemies: But the true rea&s;on the&s;e pieces are not more correct, is owing to the con&s;ideration how &s;hort a time they, and I, have to live: One may be a&s;hamed to con&s;ume half one's days in bringing &s;en&s;e and rhyme together; and what Critic can be &s;o unrea|&s;onable, as not to leave a man time enough for any more &s;erious employment, or more agreeable amu&s;e|ment?</P>
<P>The only plea I &s;hall u&s;e for the favour of the public, is, that I have as great a re&s;pect for it, as mo&s;t authors have for them&s;elves; and that I have &s;acrificed much of my own &s;elf-love for its &s;ake, in preventing not only many mean things from &s;eeing the light, but many which I thought tolerable. I would not be like tho&s;e Authors, who forgive them|&s;elves &s;ome particular lines for the &s;ake of a whole
<PB N="viii" REF="31">
Poem, and <HI>vice ver&s;a</HI> a whole Poem for the &s;ake of &s;ome particular lines. I believe no one qualifica|tion is &s;o likely to make a good writer, as the power of rejecting his own thoughts; and it mu&s;t be this (if any thing) that can give me a chance to be one. For what I have publi&s;hed, I can only hope to be pardon'd; but for what I have burn'd, I de&s;erve to be prais'd. On this account the world is under &s;ome obligation to me, and owes me the ju&s;tice in return, to look upon no ver&s;es as mine that are not in&s;erted in this collection. And per|haps nothing could make it worth my while to own what are really &s;o, but to avoid the imputa|tion of &s;o many dull and immoral things, as partly by malice, and partly by ignorance, have been a|&s;cribed to me. I mu&s;t farther acquit my&s;elf of the pre&s;umption of having lent my name to recom|mend any Mi&s;cellanies, or Works of other men; a thing I never thought becoming a per&s;on who has hardly credit enough to an&s;wer for his own.</P>
<P>In this office of collecting my pieces, I am al|together uncertain, whether to look upon my&s;elf as a man building a monument, or burying the dead.</P>
<P>If Time &s;hall make it the former, may the&s;e Poems (as long as they la&s;t) remain as a te&s;timony, that their Author never made his talents &s;ub&s;ervi|ent to the mean and unworthy ends of Party or Self-intere&s;t; the gratification of public prejudices, or private pa&s;&s;ions; the flattery of the unde&s;erv|ing,
<PB N="ix" REF="32">
or the in&s;ult of the unfortunate. If I have written well, let it be con&s;ider'd that 'tis what no man can do without good &s;en&s;e, a quality that not only renders one capable of being a good writer, but a good man. And if I have made any ac|qui&s;ition in the opinion of any one under the no|tion of the former, let it be continued to me under no other title than that of the latter.</P>
<P>But if this publication be only a more &s;olemn funeral of my Remains, I de&s;ire it may be known that I die in charity, and in my &s;en&s;es; without any murmurs again&s;t the ju&s;tice of this age, or any mad appeals to po&s;terity. I declare I &s;hall think the world in the right, and quietly &s;ubmit to every truth which time &s;hall di&s;cover to the prejudice of the&s;e writings; not &s;o much as wi&s;hing &s;o irrational a thing, as that every body &s;hould be deceived merely for my credit. However, I de&s;ire it may then be con&s;idered, That there are very few things in this collection which were not written under the age of five and twenty: &s;o that my youth may be made (as it never fails to be in Executions) a ca&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion. That I was never &s;o concerned about my works as to vindicate them in print, be|lieving, if any thing was good, it would defend it|&s;elf, and what was bad could never be defended. That I u&s;ed no artifice to rai&s;e or continue a repu|tation, depreciated no dead author I was obliged to, bribed no living one with unju&s;t prai&s;e, in&s;ulted no adver&s;ary with ill language; or when I could

not attack a Rival's works, encouraged reports again&s;t his Morals. To conclude, if this volume peri&s;h, let it &s;erve as a warning to the Critics, not to take too much pains for the future to de&s;troy &s;uch things as will die of them&s;elves; and a <HI>Me|mento mori</HI> to &s;ome of my vain contemporaries the Poets, to teach them that, when real merit is want|ing, it avails nothing to have been encouraged by the great, commended by the eminent, and fa|voured by the public in general.</P>

I'll therefore make this Pre|face a general confe&s;&s;ion of all my thoughts of my own Poetry, re&s;olving with the &s;ame freedom to

expo&s;e my&s;elf, as it is in the power of any other to expo&s;e them. In the fir&s;t place I thank God and nature, that I was born with a love to poetry; for nothing more conduces to fill up all the inter|vals of our time, or, if rightly u&s;ed, to make the whole cour&s;e of life entertaining: <HI>Cantantes licet u&s;que (minus via laedet.)</HI> 'Tis a va&s;t happine&s;s to po&s;&s;e&s;s the plea&s;ures of the head, the only plea|&s;ures in which a man is &s;ufficient to him&s;elf, and the only part of him which, to his &s;atisfaction, he can employ all day long. The Mu&s;es are <HI>amicae omnium horarum;</HI> and, like our gay acquaintance, the be&s;t company in the world as long as one ex|pects no real &s;ervice from them. I confe&s;s there was a time when I was in love with my&s;elf, and my fir&s;t productions were the children of &s;elf love upon innocence. I had made an Epic Poem, and Panegyrics on all the Princes in Europe, and thought my&s;elf the greate&s;t genius that ever was. I can't but regret tho&s;e delightful vi&s;ions of my childhood, which, like the fine colours we &s;ee when our eyes are &s;hut, are vani&s;hed for ever. Many tryals and &s;ad experience have &s;o undeceived me by degrees, that I am utterly at a lo&s;s at what rate to value my&s;elf. As for fame I &s;hall be glad of any I can get, and not repine at any I mi&s;s; and as for vanity, I have enough to keep me from hang|ing my&s;elf, or even from wi&s;hing tho&s;e hanged who would take it away. It was this that made me write. The &s;en&s;e of my faults made me cor|rect;
<PB N="xii" REF="35">
be&s;ides that it was as plea&s;ant to me to cor|rect as to write.</P>
<P><HI>At p.</HI> vii. <HI>l.</HI> 9. In the fir&s;t place I own that I have u&s;ed my be&s;t endeavours to the fini&s;hing the&s;e pieces. That I made what advantage I could of the judgment of authors dead and living; and that I omitted no means in my power to be informed of my errors by my friends and by my enemies. And that I expect no favour on account of my youth, bu&s;ine&s;s, want of health, or any &s;uch idle excu&s;es. But the true rea&s;on they are not yet more correct is owing to the con&s;ideration how &s;hort a time they and I have to live. A man that can ex|pect but &s;ixty years may be a&s;hamed to employ thirty in mea&s;uring &s;yllables and bringing &s;en&s;e and rhime together. We &s;pend our youth in pur&s;uit of riches or fame, in hopes to enjoy them when we are old; and when we are old, we find it is too late to enjoy any thing. I therefore hope the Wits will pardon me, if I re&s;erve &s;ome of my time to &s;ave my &s;oul; and that <HI>&s;ome</HI> wi&s;e men will be of my opinion, even if I &s;hould think a part of it better &s;pent in the enjoyments of life than in plea&s;ing the critics.</P>

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE ON PASTORAL POETRY<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Written at
&s;ixteen years of age.
<BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are not, I believe, a greater num|ber of any &s;ort of ver&s;es than of tho&s;e which are called Pa&s;torals; nor a &s;maller, than of tho&s;e which are truly &s;o. It therefore &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome account of this kind of Poem, and it is my de&s;ign to comprize in this &s;hort paper the &s;ub&s;tance of tho&s;e numerous di&s;&s;ertations the Critics have made on the &s;ubject, without omitting any of their rules in my own favour. You will al&s;o find &s;ome points reconciled, about which they &s;eem to differ, and a few remarks, which, I think, have e&s;caped their ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The original of Poetry is a&s;cribed to that Age which &s;ucceeded the creation of the world: and as the keeping of flocks &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t employment of mankind, the mo&s;t ancient &s;ort of poetry was probably <HI>pa&s;toral</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Fontenelle's Di&s;c. on Pa&s;torals.</BIBL> <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is natural to
<PB N="38" REF="63">
imagine, that the lei&s;ure of tho&s;e ancient &s;hepherds admitting and inviting &s;ome diver&s;ion, none was &s;o proper to that &s;olitary and &s;edentary life as &s;ing|ing; and that in their &s;ongs they took occa&s;ion to celebrate their own felicity. From hence a Poem was invented, and afterwards improved to a per|fect image of that happy time; which by giving us an e&s;teem for the virtues of a former age, might recommend them to the pre&s;ent. And &s;ince the life of &s;hepherds was attended with more tran|quillity than any other rural employment, the Poets cho&s;e to introduce their Per&s;ons, from whom it received the name of Pa&s;toral.</P>
<P>A Pa&s;toral is an imitation of the action of a &s;hepherd, or one con&s;idered under that character. The form of this imitation is dramatic, or narra|tive, or mixed of both<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hein&s;ius in Theocr.</BIBL> <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>; the fable &s;imple, the manners not too polite nor too ru&s;tic: the thoughts are plain, yet admit a little quickne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion, but that &s;hort and flowing: the expre&s;&s;ion humble, yet as pure as the language will afford; neat, but not florid; ea&s;y, and yet lively. In &s;hort, the fable, manners, thoughts, and expre&s;&s;ions are full of the greate&s;t &s;implicity in nature.</P>
<P>The complete character of this poem con&s;i&s;ts in &s;implicity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rapin de Carm. Pa&s;t. p. 2.</BIBL> <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>, brevity, and delicacy; the two fir&s;t of which render an eclogue natural, and the la&s;t delightful.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="64">
If we would copy Nature, it may be u&s;eful to take this Idea along with us, that Pa&s;toral is an image of what they call the golden age. So that we are not to de&s;cribe our &s;hepherds as &s;hep|herds at this day really are, but as they may be conceived then to have been; when the be&s;t of men followed the employment. To carry this re&s;emblance yet farther, it would not be ami&s;s to give the&s;e &s;hepherds &s;ome &s;kill in a&s;tronomy, as far as it may be u&s;eful to that &s;ort of life. And an air of piety to the Gods &s;hould &s;hine through the Poem, which &s;o vi&s;ibly appears in all the works of antiquity: and it ought to pre&s;erve &s;ome reli&s;h of the old way of writing; the connection &s;hould be loo&s;e, the narrations and de&s;criptions &s;hort<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rapin, Reflex. &s;ur l'Art Poet. d'Ari&s;t. p. 2. Refl. xxvii.</BIBL> <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>, and the periods conci&s;e. Yet it is not &s;ufficient, that the &s;entences only be brief, the whole Eclogue &s;hould be &s;o too. For we cannot &s;uppo&s;e Poetry in tho&s;e days to have been the bu&s;ine&s;s of men, but their
recreation at vacant hours.</P>
<P>But with a re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent age, nothing more conduces to make the&s;e compo&s;ures natural, than when &s;ome Knowledge in rural affairs is di&s;|covered<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pref. to Virg. Pa&s;t. in Dryd. Virg.</BIBL> <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. This may be made to appear rather done by chance than on de&s;ign, and &s;ometimes is be&s;t &s;hewn by inference; le&s;t by too much &s;tudy to &s;eem natural, we de&s;troy that ea&s;y &s;implicity from whence ari&s;es the delight. For what is in|viting
<PB N="40" REF="65">
in this &s;ort of poetry proceeds not &s;o much from the Idea of that bu&s;ine&s;s, as of the tranquil|lity of a country life.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t therefore u&s;e &s;ome illu&s;ion to render a Pa&s;toral delightful; and this con&s;i&s;ts in expo&s;ing the be&s;t &s;ide only of a &s;hepherd's life, and in con|cealing its mi&s;eries<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Fontenelle's Di&s;c. of Pa&s;torals.</BIBL> <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. Nor is it enough to introduce &s;hepherds di&s;cour&s;ing together in a natural way; but a regard mu&s;t be had to the &s;ubject; that it contain &s;ome particular beauty in it&s;elf, and that it be different in every Eclogue. Be&s;ides, in each of them a de&s;igned &s;cene or pro&s;pect is to be pre|&s;ented to our view, which &s;hould likewi&s;e have its variety<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">See the forementioned Preface. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. This variety is obtained in a great de|gree by frequent compari&s;ons, drawn from the mo&s;t agreeable objects of the country; by inter|rogations to things inanimate; by beautiful di|gre&s;&s;ions, but tho&s;e &s;hort; &s;ometimes by in&s;i&s;ting a little on circum&s;tances; and la&s;tly, by elegant turns on the words, which render the numbers extremely &s;weet and plea&s;ing. As for the num|bers them&s;elves, though they are properly of the heroic mea&s;ure, they &s;hould be the &s;moothe&s;t, the mo&s;t ea&s;y and flowing imaginable.</P>
<P>It is by rules like the&s;e that we ought to judge of Pa&s;toral. And &s;ince the in&s;tructions given for any art are to be delivered as that art is in perfec|tion, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be derived from tho&s;e
<PB N="41" REF="66">
in whom it is acknowledged &s;o to be. It is there|fore from the practice of Theocritus and Virgil (the only undi&s;puted authors of Pa&s;toral) that the Cri|tics have drawn the foregoing notions concerning it.</P>
<P>Theocritus excels all others in nature and &s;im|plicity. The &s;ubjects of his Idyllia are purely pa|&s;toral; but he is not &s;o exact in his per&s;ons, hav|ing introduced reapers <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>&THgr;&Egr;&Rgr;&Igr;&Sgr;&Tgr;&Agr;&Igr; <HI>Idyl.</HI> x. and &Agr;&Lgr;&Igr;&Egr;&Igr;&Sgr; Idyl. xxi.</BIBL> <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> and fi&s;hermen as well as &s;hepherds. He is apt to be too long in his de&s;cri|ptions, of which that of the Cup in the fir&s;t pa|&s;toral is a remarkable in&s;tance. In the manners he &s;eems a little defective, for his &s;wains are &s;ometimes abu&s;ive and immode&s;t, and perhaps too much in|clining to ru&s;ticity; for in&s;tance, in his fourth and fifth Idyllia. But 'tis enough that all others learnt their excellencies from him, and that his Dialect alone has a &s;ecret charm in it, which no other could ever attain.</P>
<P>Virgil, who copies Theocritus, refines upon his original: and in all points where judgment is principally concerned, he is much &s;uperior to his ma&s;ter. Though &s;ome of his &s;ubjects are not pa|&s;toral in them&s;elves, but only &s;eem to be &s;uch; they have a wonderful variety in them, which the Greek was a &s;tranger to<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rapin Refl. on Ari&s;t. part ii. refl. xxvii.&mdash;Pref. to the Ecl. in Dryden's Virg.</BIBL> <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. He exceeds him in regularity and brevity, and falls &s;hort of him in
<PB N="42" REF="67">
nothing but &s;implicity and propriety of &s;tyle; the fir&s;t of which perhaps was the fault of his age, and the la&s;t of his language.</P>
<P>Among the moderns, their &s;ucce&s;s has been greate&s;t who have mo&s;t endeavoured to make the&s;e ancients their pattern. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable Ge|nius appears in the famous Ta&s;&s;o, and our Spen|&s;er. Ta&s;&s;o in his Aminta has as far excelled all the Pa&s;toral writers, as in his Gieru&s;alemme he has out-done the Epic poets of his country. But as this piece &s;eems to have been the original of a new &s;ort of poem, the Pa&s;toral Comedy, in Italy, it cannot &s;o well be con&s;idered as a copy of the an|cients. Spen&s;er's Calendar, in Mr. Dryden's opi|nion, is the mo&s;t complete work of this kind which any nation has produced ever &s;ince the time of Virgil<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dedication to Virg. Ecl.</BIBL> <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. Not but that he may be thought imper|fect in &s;ome few points. His Eclogues are &s;ome|what too long, if we compare them with the an|cients. He is &s;ometimes too allegorical, and treats of matters of religion in a pa&s;toral &s;tyle, as Mantuan had done before him. He has employed the Lyric mea&s;ure, which is contrary to the prac|tice of the old Poets. His Stanza is not &s;till the &s;ame, nor always well cho&s;en. This la&s;t may be the rea&s;on his expre&s;&s;ion is &s;ometimes not conci&s;e enough: for the Tetra&s;tic has obliged him to ex|tend his &s;en&s;e to the length of four lines, which
<PB N="43" REF="68">
would have been more clo&s;ely confined in the Couplet.</P>
<P>In the manners, thoughts, and characters, he comes near to Theocritus him&s;elf; tho', notwith|&s;tanding all the care he has taken, he is certainly inferior in his Dialect: For the Doric had its beau|ty and propriety in the Time of Theocritus; it was u&s;ed in part of Greece, and frequent in the mouths of many of the greate&s;t per&s;ons: whereas the old Engli&s;h and country phra&s;es of Spen&s;er were either entirely ob&s;olete, or &s;poken only by people of the lowe&s;t condition. As there is a difference betwixt &s;implicity and ru&s;ticity, &s;o the expre&s;&s;ion of &s;im|ple thoughts &s;hould be plain, but not clowni&s;h. The addition he has made of a Calendar to his Eclogues, is very beautiful; &s;ince by this, be&s;ides the general moral of innocence and &s;implicity, which is common to other authors of Pa&s;toral, he has one peculiar to him&s;elf; he compares human Life to the &s;everal Sea&s;ons, and at once expo&s;es to his readers a view of the great and little worlds, in their various changes and a&s;pects. Yet the &s;cru|pulous divi&s;ion of his Pa&s;torals into Months, has obliged him either to repeat the &s;ame de&s;cription, in other words, for three months together; or, when it was exhau&s;ted before, entirely to omit it: whence it comes to pa&s;s that &s;ome of his Eclogues (as the &s;ixth, eighth, and tenth for example) have nothing but their Titles to di&s;tingui&s;h them. The rea&s;on is evident, becau&s;e the year has not that va|riety
<PB N="44" REF="69">
in it to furni&s;h every month with a particular de&s;cription, as it may every &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Of the following Eclogues I &s;hall only &s;ay, that the&s;e four comprehend all the &s;ubjects which the Critics upon Theocritus and Virgil will allow to be fit for pa&s;toral: That they have as much va|riety of de&s;cription, in re&s;pect of the &s;everal &s;ea|&s;ons, as Spen&s;er's: that in order to add to this variety, the &s;everal times of the day are ob&s;erv'd, the rural employments in each &s;ea&s;on or time of day, and the rural &s;cenes or places proper to &s;uch employments; not without &s;ome regard to the &s;e|veral ages of man, and the different pa&s;&s;ions pro|per to each age.</P>
<P>But after all, if they have any merit, it is to be attributed to &s;ome good old Authors, who&s;e works as I had lei&s;ure to &s;tudy, &s;o I hope I have not want|ed care to imitate.</P>

<P ID="CT005432PT1.P1-RA">The&s;e Pa&s;torals were written at the age of &s;ixteen, and then pa&s;t thro' the hands of Mr. <HI>Wal&s;h,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wycherley, G.

All the&s;e gave our Author the greate&s;t encouragement, and par|ticularly Mr. <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> (whom Mr. Dryden, in his Po&s;t&s;cript to Vir|gil, calls the be&s;t critic of his age.) <Q REND="inline">"The Author (&s;ays he) &s;eems to have a particular genius for this kind of Poetry, and a judgment that much exceeds his years.

very freely from the Ancients. But what he has mixed of his own with theirs is no way inferior to what he has taken from them. It is not flattery at all to &s;ay that Virgil had written nothing &s;o good at his Age. His Preface is very judicious and learned."</Q> <HI>Letter to Mr. Wycherley, Ap.</HI> 1705. The Lord Lan&s;down about the &s;ame time, mentioning the youth of our Poet, &s;ays (in a printed Letter of the Character of Mr. Wy|cherley) <Q REND="inline">"that if he goes on as he has begun in the Pa&s;toral way, as Virgil fir&s;t tried his &s;trength, we may hope to &s;ee Engli&s;h Poety vie with the Roman,"</Q> etc.   Notwith&s;tanding the ear|ly time of their production, the Author e&s;teemed the&s;e as the mo&s;t correct in the ver&s;ification, and mu&s;ical in the numbers, of all his works. The rea&s;on for his labouring them into &s;o much &s;oftne&s;s, was, doubtle&s;s, that this &s;ort of poetry derives almo&s;t its whole beauty from a natural ea&s;e of thought and &s;moothne&s;s of ver&s;e; whereas that of mo&s;t other kinds con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;trength and fulne&s;s of both. In a letter of his to Mr. <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> about this time we find an enumeration of &s;everal Niceties in Ver&s;ification, which perhaps have never been &s;trictly ob&s;erved in any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> poem, except in the&s;e Pa&s;torals.

<P>IN reading &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of the Prophet I&s;aiah, which foretell the coming of Chri&s;t and the felicities attending it, I could not but ob&s;erve a remarkable pa|rity between many of the thoughts, and tho&s;e in the Pollio of Virgil. This will not &s;eem &s;urpri&s;ing, when we reflect, that the Eclogue was taken from a Sibylline prophecy on the &s;ame &s;ubject. One may judge that Virgil did not copy it line by line, but &s;elected &s;uch ideas as be&s;t agreed with the nature of pa&s;toral poetry, and di&s;po&s;ed them in that manner which &s;erved mo&s;t to beautify his piece. I have endeavoured the &s;ame in this imitation of him, though without admitting any thing of my own; &s;ince it was written with this parti|cular view, that the reader, by comparing the &s;everal thoughts, might &s;ee how far the images and de&s;crip|tions of the Prophet are &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the Poet. But as I fear I have prejudiced them by my management, I &s;hall &s;ubjoin the pa&s;&s;ages of I&s;aiah, and tho&s;e of Virgil, under the &s;ame di&s;advantage of a literal tran&s;lation. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P ID="CT005432PT1.EC-C"><Q REND="inline"><HI>An E&s;&s;ay</HI>]</Q> The Poem is in one book, but divided into three principals parts or members. The fir&s;t [to &vers; 201.] gives rules for the <HI>Study of the Art of Critici&s;m:</HI> the &s;econd [from thence to &vers; 560.] expo&s;es the <HI>Cau&s;es of wrong Judgment;</HI> and the third [from thence to the end] pre&s;cribes the <HI>Morals of the Critic.</HI></P>
<P>In order to a right under&s;tanding of this poem, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that tho' it be intitled &s;imply <HI>an E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m,</HI> yet &s;everal of the precepts relate equally to the good <HI>writing</HI> as well as to the true <HI>judging</HI> of a poem. This is &s;o far from violating the <HI>Unity</HI> of the Subject, that it rounds and com|pleats it: or from di&s;ordering the regularity of the <HI>Form,</HI> that it produces the highe&s;t beauty which can ari&s;e out of method, as will appear by the following con&s;iderations: 1. It was impo&s;&s;i|ble to give a full and exact idea of the <HI>Art of poetical Critici&s;m,</HI> without con&s;idering, at the &s;ame time, the <HI>Art of Poetry;</HI> &s;o far as Poetry is an <HI>Art.</HI> The&s;e therefore being clo&s;ely connect|ed in nature, the Author has with much judgment reciprocally
<PB N="138" REF="160">
interwoven the precepts of both thro' his whole poem. 2. As all the rules of the ancient Critics were taken from Poets who copied nature, this is another rea&s;on why every Poet &s;hould be a Critic: Therefore, as the &s;ubject is <HI>poetical Critici&s;m,</HI> it is fre|quently addre&s;&s;ed to the <HI>critical Poet.</HI> And 3dly, the Art of Critici&s;m is as nece&s;&s;arily, and much more u&s;efully exerci&s;ed in <HI>writing</HI> than in <HI>judging.</HI></P>
<P>But Readers have been mi&s;led by the mode&s;ty of the <HI>Title:</HI> which only promi&s;es an Art of <HI>Critici&s;m,</HI> in a treati&s;e, and that a compleat one, of the Art both of <HI>Critici&s;m</HI> and <HI>Poetry.</HI> This, and the not attending to the con&s;iderations offered above, per|haps was what mi&s;led a very candid writer, after having given this Piece all the prai&s;es on the &s;ide of genius and poetry which his true ta&s;te could not re&s;u&s;e it, to &s;ay, that <HI>the ob&s;ervations fol|low one another like tho&s;e in</HI> Horace's Art of Poetry, <HI>without that methodical regularity which would have been requi&s;ite in a pro&s;e writer.</HI> Spec. No 235. I do not &s;ee how <HI>method</HI> can hurt any one grace of Poetry; or what prerogative there is in ver&s;e to to di&s;pen&s;e with <HI>regularity.</HI> The remark is fal&s;e in every part of it. Mr. Pope's <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m,</HI> the Reader will &s;oon &s;ee, is a regular piece: And a very learned Critic has lately &s;hewn, that <HI>Horace</HI> had the &s;ame attention to method in his <HI>Art of Poetry.</HI></P>
<P ID="CT005432PT1.EC-C1">VER. 1. <Q REND="inline"><HI>'Tis hard to &s;ay, etc.</HI>]</Q> The Poem opens [from &vers; 1 to 9.] with &s;hewing the u&s;e and &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of the &s;ubject. Its <HI>u&s;e,</HI> from the greater mi&s;chief in wrong Critici&s;m than in ill Poetry, this only tiring that mi&s;leading the reader: Its <HI>&s;ea&s;on|ablene&s;s,</HI> from the growing number of fal&s;e Critics, which now va&s;tly exceeds that of bad Poets.</P>
<P ID="CT005432PT1.EC-C9">VER. 9. <Q REND="inline"><HI>'Tis with our judgments, etc.</HI>]</Q> The author having
<PB N="139" REF="161">
&s;hewn us the expediency of his &s;ubject, the Art of <HI>Critici&s;m,</HI> next inquires [from &vers; 8 to 15] into the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Qualities</HI> of a <HI>true Critic:</HI> And ob&s;erves fir&s;t, that JUDGMENT, &s;imply and alone, is not &s;ufficient to con&s;titute this character, becau&s;e <HI>Judg|ment,</HI> like the <HI>artificial mea&s;ures of Time,</HI> goes different, and yet each relies upon his own. The rea&s;on is conclu&s;ive; and the &s;imilitude extremely ju&s;t. For <HI>Judgment,</HI> when alone, is always regulated, or at lea&s;t much inflenced by cu&s;tom, fa&s;hion, and habit; and never certain and con&s;tant but when &s;ounded upon TASTE: which is the &s;ame in the <HI>Critic,</HI> as GENIUS in the <HI>Poet:</HI> both are derived from Heaven, and like the Sun (the <HI>natural mea&s;ure of Time)</HI> always con&s;tant and equal.</P>
<P>Nor need we wonder that Judgment alone will not make a Critic in poetry, when we &s;ee that it will not make a Poet. And on examination we &s;hall find, that <HI>Genius</HI> and <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> are but one and the &s;ame faculty, differently exerting it&s;elf under different names, in the two pro&s;e&s;&s;ions of <HI>Poet</HI> and <HI>Critic.</HI> For the Art of Poetry con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>&s;electing,</HI> out of all tho&s;e images which pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the fancy, &s;uch of them as are truly poetical: And the Art of Critici&s;m in judiciou&s;ly di&s;cerning, and fully reli&s;hing what it finds &s;o &s;elected. 'Tis the &s;ame opera|tion of the mind in both ca&s;es, and con&s;equently, exerted by the &s;ame faculty. All the difference is, that in the Poet this fa|culty is eminently joined with a <HI>bright imagination,</HI> and <HI>exten|&s;ive comprehen&s;ion,</HI> which provide &s;tores for the &s;election, and can form that &s;election, by proportioned parts, into a regular whole: In the Critic, with a <HI>&s;olid judgment</HI> and <HI>accurate di&s;cern|ment;</HI> which penetrate into the cau&s;es of an excellence, and can &s;hew that excellence in all its variety of lights. <HI>Longinus</HI> had <HI>ta&s;te</HI> in an eminent degree; &s;o this, which is indeed common to all true Critics, our Author makes his di&s;tingui&s;hing character,

Hence the poet ob&s;erves, that as Nature is the <HI>&s;ource,</HI> &s;he con|veys <HI>life</HI> to Art: As &s;he is the <HI>end,</HI> &s;he conveys <HI>force</HI> to it, for the <HI>force</HI> of any thing ari&s;es from its being directed to its <HI>end:</HI> And, as &s;he is the <HI>te&s;t,</HI> &s;he conveys <HI>beauty</HI> to it, for every thing acquires <HI>beauty</HI> by its being reduced to its true <HI>&s;tandard.</HI> Such is the &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e two important lines,
<Q><L>Life, force, <HI>and</HI> beauty <HI>mu&s;t to all impart,</HI></L>
<L><HI>At once the</HI> &s;ource, <HI>and</HI> end, <HI>and</HI> te&s;t <HI>of Art.</HI></L></Q>
We now come to the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of the Precept. The two great con&s;tituent qualities of a <HI>Compo&s;ition,</HI> as &s;uch, are <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Wit:</HI> But neither of the&s;e attains perfection, 'till the fir&s;t be <HI>hid,</HI> and the other judiciou&s;ly <HI>re&s;trained;</HI> which is only then when <HI>Na|ture</HI> is exactly followed; for then Art never makes a parade, nor can Wit commit an extravagance. Art, while it <HI>adheres</HI> to Nature, and has &s;o large a <HI>fund</HI> in the re&s;ources which Nature &s;upplies, di&s;po&s;es every thing with &s;o much <HI>ea&s;e</HI> and <HI>&s;implicity,</HI> that we &s;ee nothing but tho&s;e natural images it works with, while it&s;elf &s;tands unob&s;erv'd behind: But when Art <HI>leaves</HI> Na|ture, deluded either by the bold extravagance of Fancy, or the quaint odne&s;&s;es of Fa&s;hion, &s;he is then obliged at every &s;tep to come forward, in a painful or pompous o&s;tentation, in order to cover, to &s;often, or to regulate the &s;hocking di&s;proportion of <HI>unnatural</HI> images. In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> ca&s;e, the poet compares Art to the Soul within, informing a beauteous Body; but we general|ly find it, in the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> only like the outward Habit, bol&s;tering up, by the Taylor's &s;kill, the defects of a mis-&s;hapen one.&mdash;As to

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT will be in vain to deny that I have &s;ome regard for this piece, &s;ince I dedicate it to You. Yet you may bear me witne&s;s, it was intended only to divert a few young Ladies, who have good &s;en&s;e and good hu|mour enough to laugh not only at their &s;ex's little un|guarded follies, but at their own. But as it was com|municated with the air of a Secret, it &s;oon found its way into the world. An imperfect copy having been offer'd to a Book&s;eller, you had the good-nature for my &s;ake to con&s;ent to the publication of one more correct: This I was forc'd to, before I had executed half my de|&s;ign, for the Machinery was entirely wanting to com|pleat it.</P>
<P>The Machinery, Madam, is a term invented by the Critics, to &s;ignify that part which the Deities, Angels, or Daemons are made to act in a Poem: For the an|cient Poets are in one re&s;pect like many modern Ladies: let an action be never &s;o trivial in it&s;elf, they always make it appear of the utmo&s;t importance. The&s;e Ma|chines I determin'd to rai&s;e on a very new and odd foun|dation, the Ro&s;icrucian doctrine of Spirits.</P>
<P>I know how di&s;agreeable it is to make u&s;e of hard words before a Lady; but 'tis &s;o much the concern of a Poet to have his works under&s;tood, and particularly by your Sex, that you mu&s;t give me leave to explain two or three difficult terms.</P>
<P>The Ro&s;icrucians are a people I mu&s;t bring you ac|quainted with. The be&s;t account I know of them is in
<PB N="216" REF="236">
a French book call'd <HI>Le Comte de Gabalis,</HI> which both in its title and &s;ize is &s;o like a Novel, that many of the Fair Sex have read it for one by mi&s;take. According to the&s;e Gentlemen, the four Elements are inhabited by Spirits, which they call Sylphs, Gnomes, Nymphs, and Salamanders. The Gnomes or Daemons of Earth de|light in mi&s;chief; but the Sylphs, who&s;e habitation is in the Air, are the be&s;t-condition'd creatures imagina|ble. For they &s;ay, any mortals may enjoy the mo&s;t in|timate familiarities with the&s;e gentle Spirits, upon a con|dition very ea&s;y to all true Adepts, an inviolate pre&s;er|vation of Cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>As to the following Canto's, all the pa&s;&s;ages of them are as fabulous, as the Vi&s;ion at the beginning, or the Transformation at the end; (except the lo&s;s of your Hair, which I always mention with reverence.) The Human per&s;ons are as fictitious as the Airy ones; and the character of Belinda, as it is now manag'd, re&s;em|bles you in nothing but in Beauty.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>It appears, by this Motto, that the following Poem was written or publi&s;hed at the Lady's reque&s;t. But there are &s;ome further circum&s;tances not unworthy relating. Mr. Caryl (a Gentleman who was Secretary to Queen Mary, wife of James II. who&s;e fortunes he followed into France, Author of the Co|medy of <HI>Sir Solomon Single,</HI> and of &s;everal tran&s;lations in Dry|den's Mi&s;cellanies) originally propo&s;ed the &s;ubject to him in a view of putting an end, by this piece of ridicule, to a quarrel that was ri&s;en between two noble Families, tho&s;e of Lord Petre and of Mrs. Fermor, on the trifling occa&s;ion of his having cut off a lock of her hair. The Author &s;ent it to the Lady, with whom he was acquainted; and &s;he took it &s;o well as to give about co|pies of it. That fir&s;t &s;ketch, (we learn from one of his Letters) was written in le&s;s than a fortnight, in 1711. in two Canto's only, and it was &s;o printed; fir&s;t, in a Mi&s;cellany of Bern. Lin|tot's, without the name of the Author. But it was received &s;o well that he made it more con&s;iderable the next year by the addition of the machinery of the Sylphs, and extended it to five Canto's. We &s;hall give the reader the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing in what manner the&s;e additions were in&s;erted, &s;o as to &s;eem not to be added, but to grow out of the Poem. See Notes, Cant. I. &vers; 19, etc. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>

<P ID="CT005432PT1.RL1-N20">VER. 20. <Q REND="inline"><HI>Her Guardian Sylph</HI>]</Q> When Mr. Pope had pro|jected to give this Poem its pre&s;ent form, he was obliged to find it with its Machinery. For as the &s;ubject of the Epic Poem con&s;i&s;ts of two parts, the <HI>metaphy&s;ical</HI> and the <HI>civil;</HI> &s;o this mock epic, which is of the &s;atiric kind, and receives its grace from a ludicrous imitation of the other's pomp and &s;olemnity, was to have the &s;ame divi&s;ion of the &s;ubject. And, as the <HI>civil</HI> part is intenti|onally deba&s;ed by the choice of an in&s;ignificant action: &s;o &s;hould the <HI>metaphy&s;ical,</HI> by the u&s;e of &s;ome very extravagant &s;y&s;tem. A rule, which tho' neither Boileau nor Garth have been careful enough to attend to, our Author's good &s;en&s;e would not &s;uffer him to overlook. And that &s;ort of Machinery which his judg|ment taught him was only fit for his u&s;e, his admirable inven|tion &s;upplied. There was but one Sy&s;tem in all nature which was to his purpo&s;e, the <HI>Ro&s;icrucian Philo&s;ophy;</HI> and this, by the well directed effort of his imagination, he pre&s;ently &s;eized upon. The fanatic Alchemi&s;ts, in their &s;earch after the great &s;ecret, had invented a <HI>means</HI> altogether proportioned to their <HI>end.</HI> It was a kind of Theological-Philo&s;ophy, made up of almo&s;t equal mix|tures of Pagan Platoni&s;m, Chri&s;tian Quieti&s;m, and the Jewi&s;h Cabbala; a compo&s;ition enough to fright Rea&s;on from human commerce. This general &s;y&s;tem, he tells us, he took as he found it in a little French tract called, <HI>Le Comte de Gabalis.</HI> This book is written in Dialogue, and is a delicate and very ingeni|ous
<PB N="220" REF="241">
piece of raillery of the Abbe Villiers, upon that invi&s;ible &s;ect, of which the &s;tories that went about at that time, made a great deal of noi&s;e at Paris. But, as in this &s;atirical Dialogue, Mr. P. found &s;everal whim&s;ies, of a very high my&s;terious kind, told of the nature of the&s;e elementary beings, which were very unfit to come into the machinery of &s;uch a &s;ort of poem, he has with great judgment omitted them; and in their &s;tead, made u&s;e of the Legendary &s;tories of Guardian Angels, and the Nur&s;ery Tales of the Fairies; which he has artfully accommodated to the re&s;t of the <HI>Ro&s;icrucian Sy&s;tem.</HI> And to this, (unle&s;s we will be &s;o uncharitable to believe he intended to give a needle&s;s &s;candal) we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e he referred, in the&s;e two lines,

<L><HI>Of all the</HI> nur&s;e, <HI>and all the</HI> prie&s;t <HI>have taught.</HI></L></Q>
Thus, by the mo&s;t beautiful invention imaginable, he has con|trived, that, as in the &s;erious Epic. the popular belief &s;upports the Machinery; &s;o, in his mock Epic, the Machinery &s;hould be contrived to di&s;mount philo&s;ophic pride and arrogance.</P>
