<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HOWEVER &s;paring modern Authors
are in giving due prai&s;e to their Cotempora|ries,
they &s;eem to be more united in acknow|ledging
the merit of tho&s;e who, to u&s;e the
language of the P&s;almi&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"have cea&s;ed from
their labours."</Q> Writers, who&s;e works have
&s;tood the te&s;t of years, have acquired a kind
of pre&s;criptive title to celebrity, not on ac|count
of that &s;uperior wi&s;dom which is often
attributed to times we have &s;urvived, or the
&s;uppo&s;ed degeneracy of the pre&s;ent, but be|cau&s;e,
what has been long known has been
more reflected upon, and what undergoes this
examination is better under&s;tood.</P>
<P>In the catalogue of Authors, who&s;e wri|tings
have met with public reception, none
have been more ju&s;tly celebrated than tho&s;e
of POPE, and <HI>his Cotemporaries</HI>; in&s;omuch,
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
that their names have not only been honour|ably
recorded, but the period in which they
lived has been pre-eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed by
the title of the <HI>Augu&s;tan Age.</HI> Other points
of time have here and there given birth to
a great genius, who, like a leading &s;tar, has
enlightened the horizon of literature, but no
particular aera, at lea&s;t of our hi&s;tory, has
produced &s;o general, and collected a light as
this; a light which, at once, &s;hone upon every
part of &s;cience, at the &s;ame time that it il|luminated
the circle of morality.</P>
<P>What could have been the cau&s;e why &s;uch
a clu&s;ter of great men flouri&s;hed at the &s;ame
period of time, and why we have had no &s;imilar
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion ever &s;ince? Whether the fir&s;t aro&s;e
from the emulation of author&s;hip, which, like
the colli&s;ion of hard bodies, &s;truck a fire from
each other, or that the latter was occa&s;ioned
by the number of fini&s;hed pieces they gave
to the world, which has ever &s;ince occa&s;ioned
a kind of literary &s;atiety, is a que&s;tion, per|haps,
not &s;o readily decided. This however
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
is as generally known, as a&s;&s;ented to, that
from the very few eminent geniu&s;es who
have ari&s;en &s;ince the flouri&s;hing days of this
illu&s;trious Junto, nature &s;eems to have in|dulged
her&s;elf in a temporary repo&s;e.</P>
<P>When Authors, therefore, have thus long
engaged the public attention, when their
works are read with avidity, and univer&s;ally
receive a cla&s;&s;ical &s;tamp, tho&s;e who can add
any thing to their illu&s;tration, and recover
by time what has eluded former diligence,
bring an acceptable pre&s;ent to the public.
It is with good Authors as with good men;
the nearer, and more intimately they are
viewed, the more we are able to &s;et a proper
value upon their characters, and look up to
them as more enforcing examples of imitation
and in&s;truction.</P>
<P>Under this idea, the Editor thinks he need
make no apology in pre&s;enting the public
with two additional volumes to the Works of
Mr. POPE, which contain &s;uch of that celebrated
Bard's pieces, in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, together with
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
many of his Cotemporaries, as for particular
and local rea&s;ons were then &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, might
have been mi&s;laid, or perhaps got into too
remote hands to be collected with ea&s;e. He
is aware, at the &s;ame time, that the public
rage for the remains of celebrated men, has
occa&s;ioned many &s;purious productions being
fathered on them, under the well-known titles
of <HI>&s;econd parts,</HI> and <HI>po&s;thumous works.</HI> Our
be&s;t Authors, and principally our be&s;t, have
been &s;ubject to &s;uch impo&s;itions, which, tho'
they have been in time detected, have yet
an&s;wered the illiberal purpo&s;es of &s;uch a tem|porary
publication. The Editor of the pre|&s;ent
Work, to get clear of the &s;hadow of
an imputation in this line, is the fir&s;t to
remind the public, that &s;everal of the pieces
here exhibited originally appeared in <HI>The St.
James's Chronicle.</HI></P>
<P>The favourable reception they met with
in that fugitive mode of publication, fir&s;t
&s;ugge&s;ted to him a wi&s;h to give them a more
durable form; he accordingly communicated
<PB N="v" REF="7">
this wi&s;h to his friends, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in
his de&s;ign, &s;o much beyond his expectation,
that in&s;tead of <HI>one</HI> volume (his original in|tention)
he has, by their favour, been able
to make out <HI>two</HI>; compo&s;ed of &s;uch materials,
as he flatters him&s;elf will acquit him of the
charge of an ha&s;ty, or &s;elf-intere&s;ted compiler.</P>
<P>Many of the <HI>Letters</HI> and <HI>Poems,</HI> of which
this publication con&s;i&s;ts, were tran&s;cribed
with accuracy from the originals, in the
collections of the late Lords Oxford and
Bolingbroke, who are well known to have
lived in the &s;tricte&s;t intimacy with Mr. POPE,
as well as his literary friends and a&s;&s;ociates.
Some of the <HI>latter</HI> will be found no way in|ferior
to other productions of the &s;ame Au|thors.
All of the fragments, more or le&s;s,
carry the marks of a ma&s;ter. Others of the
Letters are taken from pamphlets printed
&s;ome years ago, which, in the detached man|ner
they then appeared, will, it is to be hoped,
fully ju&s;tify their pre&s;ent mode of publica|tion.
They, for the mo&s;t part, treat of cri|tical,
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
friendly, humorous, and literary &s;ub|jects,
and ab&s;tracted from the&s;e, throw new
lights upon the character of Mr. POPE, as a
man.</P>
<P>His Letters to his favourite Mi&s;s Blount
lead to the &s;upport of a charge often urged
again&s;t him &mdash; <HI>his want of original inven|tion</HI>;
for tho' the extent of his erudition, and
his elegant turn of thinking, gave him a
&s;uperiority to all his Cotemporaries in poli&s;hing,
to a degree of <HI>originality,</HI> other people's &s;en|timents;
yet here, whether from the carele&s;s|ne&s;s
ari&s;ing from intimate friend&s;hip, idlene&s;s,
or the &s;uppo&s;ition of his not being detected
by his fair corre&s;pondent, he has committed
a plagiari&s;m on Voiture, which would be un|worthy
a much le&s;s celebrated pen than his.</P>
<P>His Letter to Jabez Hughes, E&s;q. brother
to the author of the Siege of Dama&s;cus, with
that of his to Mr. Dennis, the critic, are
melancholy proofs that the greate&s;t genius
cannot always &s;hield men from duplicity of
conduct in their literary characters, and bring
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
another corroboration to the te&s;timony of
Gay's a&s;&s;ertion, that
<Q><L>"Wits are game-cocks to each other."</L></Q>
But if the&s;e Letters &s;hew the weakne&s;&s;es,
perhaps the in&s;eparable weakne&s;&s;es from hu|man
nature, others will &s;hew &s;ome of its
faire&s;t, and brighte&s;t &s;ides; they will exhibit
the &s;tronge&s;t <HI>traits</HI> of his humanity and
friend&s;hip, his wit, his learning, and his
morals; they will confirm his more than
Roman affection to his parents, and parti|cularly
to his aged mother, who&s;e life he
watched over with &s;uch &s;oothing &s;olicitude
and exemplary reverence, as force us for a
while to turn from the lu&s;tre of his talents to
admire the &s;uperiority of his &s;ilial character.</P>
<P>A few Poems and Letters will be found
in this collection, which appeared only in
&s;ome of the editions of his works, in none
of them quite perfect, which are particularly
di&s;tingui&s;hed in the latter, by the additional
paragraphs being printed in Italics. This will
<PB N="viii" REF="10">
ju&s;tify their republication here, more parti|cularly
as many of them are written in that
unre&s;erved, open manner, which his original
Editor might have a wi&s;h to conceal for many
rea&s;ons, that now no longer remain; at pre|&s;ent,
the re&s;toration of them can neither in|dulge
vanity, nor gratify &s;pleen: they may be
read without any other rea&s;on than the de&s;ire
of plea&s;ure, and are therefore only to be
prai&s;ed as that object is obtained.</P>
<P>To many, in an age like this, where
hypocri&s;y in morals is much practi&s;ed, (as
is &s;hewn by our dramatic, and other writers,)
perhaps a few of the Poems may appear
too loo&s;e and de&s;criptive, particularly "The
Farewel to London," the conclu&s;ion of the
"Addre&s;s to Mi&s;s Blount on leaving Town,"
and &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in "The Sober Advice
from Horace, &amp;c." by Mr. POPE; together
with the Poem called "Virtue in Danger," and
others by Lady Mary Wortley Montague: but
on a proper examination this charge of in|decency
will be found to lie more in the
readers turn of thinking, than the defects of
<PB N="ix" REF="11">
the writer. A poet who wants to give his &s;ub|ject
due force, &s;hould comply with the rules
of his profe&s;&s;ion, by u&s;ing <Q REND="inline">"proper words in
proper places,"</Q> and provided he keeps a
&s;teady eye on the moral of his piece, the more
he colours from nature, the more he a&s;&s;i&s;ts
his de&s;ign, whil&s;t the <HI>hint</HI> and <HI>double entendrez,</HI>
tho&s;e mock draperies of delicacy, often create
a more indecent meaning than the circum|&s;tance
will allow, and urge the young and in|experienced
reader more to the exerci&s;e of his
pa&s;&s;ions than his rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Swift's delicacy has been often arraigned
on the &s;ame principle; and his "Lady's
Dre&s;&s;ing Room," and others of his Poems
of a &s;imilar &s;tamp, are ever &s;ure to be ad|duced
as convincing proofs of this charge.
But where is the woman of real &s;en&s;e and
cleanline&s;s offended at it? Con&s;cious &s;he de|&s;erves
no &s;uch reprehen&s;ion in her own con|duct,
&s;he &s;ees the general force of the &s;atire
only directed to the &s;latterns of her &s;ex, and
is plea&s;ed with the hope of a con&s;equent
reformation. In &s;hort, the Editor is entirely
<PB N="x" REF="12">
of opinion, that the &s;ame rule re&s;pecting
decency, which a modern arti&s;t has laid down
in painting, will equally hold good in poetry.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is not in &s;hewing, or concealing the
naked, that mode&s;ty or lewdne&s;s depend.
They ari&s;e entirely from the choice and
intentions of the arti&s;t him&s;elf. A great
mind can rai&s;e great, or plea&s;ing ideas,
though he &s;hews all the parts of the body
in their natural way, whil&s;t the Cheap&s;ide
prints of the <HI>Buck and Quaker Girl,</HI> the
charms of the <HI>Garter</HI> and <HI>High-wind,</HI> are
proofs that very lewd ideas might be pro|duced,
though little or nothing of the
naked be di&s;covered; and there is no doubt,
but that the <HI>Venus De Medicis</HI> might be
converted into a very lewd figure <HI>by dre&s;&s;ing
her out for that purpo&s;e</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barry on the Arts.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The letters which pa&s;&s;ed between Mr.
POPE, and his book&s;ellers, which are to be
found in the &s;econd of the&s;e volumes, may
appear to tho&s;e who are to be no otherwi&s;e
<PB N="xi" REF="13">
plea&s;ed with human genius than &s;eeing it
eternally on the &s;tretch, rather too tri&s;ling;
and as the public voice is not a little rai&s;ed
upon like occa&s;ions, the Editor thinks it
may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething on this
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>It is objected, that mo&s;t of our great wri|ters
no &s;ooner e&s;tabli&s;h a reputation for their
works, but there are never wanting intere&s;ted
people, who preferring a private lucre either
to the fame of the author, or national honour,
bu&s;y them&s;elves in gleaning up their mo&s;t un|intere&s;ting
thoughts on the mo&s;t unintere&s;ting
&s;ubjects; &s;uch as letters to trade&s;men, &amp;c.
and that kind of dome&s;tic corre&s;pondence,
which, to u&s;e the language of a modern au|thor,
<Q REND="inline">"a wi&s;e man &s;hould be a&s;hamed to re|member."</Q></P>
<P>Was a collection of this kind purpo&s;ely
made for the filling up a volume without the
lea&s;t regard to amu&s;ement, curio&s;ity, or in|&s;truction,
it mu&s;t &s;oon defeat its own pur|po&s;es;
for, however common readers may for
<PB N="xii" REF="14">
a while be plea&s;ed with the novelty, the re|probation
it mu&s;t receive from men of &s;en&s;e,
would &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;h it as the <HI>mortal part</HI> of
an author, and in this &s;tate con&s;ign it to ob|livion.
But trifling as the&s;e Letters ap|pear
to be, many of them referring to literary
bu&s;ine&s;s, help to &s;ettle dates, and explain re|ferences,
which perhaps before were not quite
&s;o intelligible, and like tho&s;e well dige&s;ted
que&s;tions on a legal examination, which how|ever
&s;imple they may appear in re&s;pect to
their immediate enquiries are yet important, as
they &s;trengthen, or elucidate a fact in their
connections. Others will &s;erve to &s;hew the
degree of intimacy between the poet and book|&s;eller
of that time, the proce&s;s of publica|tion,
and many other little anecdotes of par|ties
and places, too <HI>trifling</HI> to be otherwi&s;e
recorded, but by this mode of pre&s;ervation,
and yet too <HI>curious</HI> (at lea&s;t to literary enqui|rers)
to fall down the &s;tream of ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>The Editor having now made tho&s;e apo|logies
which he thought nece&s;&s;ary for offering
the&s;e volumes to the public, he will no longer
<PB N="xiii" REF="15">
detain them from the exerci&s;e of their own
judgement. He cannot, however, conclude
without a&s;&s;uring them that his de&s;ign in this
compilation was no more than to collect in one
view, &s;uch pieces of our celebrated Engli&s;h
Bard, and his Cotemporaries, as may be lo&s;t
to the world from a fugitive mode of pub|lication,
and others which might be equally
lo&s;t from their being only open to the in&s;pec|tion
of the few. In this, as he has &s;pared
no indu&s;try, or expence him&s;elf, and &s;tands
much indebted to the re&s;earches and intere&s;t
of many of his friends, he hopes to have
the merit of a faithful and u&s;eful Com|piler,
and that the&s;e volumes may not be
thought improper appendages to the pre&s;ent
edition of POPE'S WORKS.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>OF all kinds of poetry the Dida&s;calic is the mo&s;t
valuable, if aiming at the good of mankind be what
ju&s;tly entitles any thing to that character. The de|&s;criptive
kind is like a fine land&s;kip, where you meet
with two or three principal figures; the re&s;t is all
rocks, rivulets, hanging woods and verdant lawns,
amu&s;ing to the eye, &s;hewing the ta&s;te of the painter,
but carrying little in&s;truction along with it. But
the Dida&s;calic is like a curious piece of hi&s;tory paint|ing,
where every figure mu&s;t be highly wrought,
every pa&s;&s;ion &s;trongly repre&s;ented, all contributing in
their &s;everal degrees to expre&s;s the main de&s;ign; in
&s;hort, it mu&s;t be a fini&s;hed piece.</P>
<P>That this is a very difficult work may be collected
from the &s;mall number of tho&s;e poets who have ever
attempted it. In the early ages of the Grecians, I
remember none who have wrote any thing in this way
but old He&s;iod, Aratus, and Nicander; for Diony|&s;ius,
the Periegetic, and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Age&s;ilaus, Oppian's father, was a man of great learning and merit as well as wealth and power, in the city of Anazarbus in Cilicia, where he liv'd: Severus making a progre&s;s, came to that town, and Age&s;ilaus being not at the proce&s;&s;ion to meet the Emperor at his entrance, probably on account of his age and infirmities, that prince, to puni&s;h him for &s;o heinous a crime, bani&s;h'd the poor old man to Malta. Oppian, to amu&s;e his father under his misfortune, took to writing of poetry, and after|wards dedicated his Halieutics to the Emperor's &s;on. The Emperor was &s;o pleas'd with the poem, that he or|der'd him a piece of gold for each line, and offer'd him any other favour he would a&s;k. The fir&s;t part of the &s;tory is not at all wonderful, but I mu&s;t confe&s;s the la&s;t part is a little &s;urprizing.</NOTE> Oppian, liv'd not 'till the
<PB N="60" REF="79">
time of the Roman Emperors. He&s;iod's works and
days is the only piece remaining that is allow'd to be
genuine without di&s;pute; but by Virgil's, and e&s;peci|ally
Manilius's compliments to him, 'tis highly pro|bable
he wrote others, and perhaps more valuable
ones, tho' Quintilian allows him the <HI>Palma in illo
medio genere dicendi</HI> only, and Le Fevre is much more
hard upon him when he makes him little better than
an almanack-maker, and his work a mean perform|ance.
Paterculus and Plutarch &s;et him next to
Homer, as well in the value of his works, as in the
period of his age, &s;ays Mr. Kennet; but perhaps that
may be the other extreme. Aratus wrote a poem, in
two books, which he calls the Phaenomena, and
Dio&s;emeia, the one a&s;tronomical, giving an account
of the &s;ituation and the affection of the heavenly
bodies, the other a&s;trological, &s;hewing the particular
influences ari&s;ing from their various di&s;po&s;itions and
relations<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Kennet's lives of the Greek poets.</NOTE>. Tully commends him for his ver&s;ifica|tion,
<PB N="61" REF="80">
and Quintilian &s;ays, he has fully an&s;wer'd his
argument, which put together, &s;hould make up a
pretty good character. As to Nicander, Vo&s;&s;ius
places him among&s;t his Greek hi&s;torians, but allows
him to have been <HI>egregius grammaticus, poeta, &amp;

medicus.</HI> His &s;urviving works are, however, only
poetry upon poi&s;ons, and the methods of cure for
them. Of the two latter Greek poets, Diony&s;ius
and Oppian, the one wrote a &s;urvey of the world,
and the other Cynegetics and Halieutics, in both which
'tis certain there are very fine parts, however judg|ments
may differ about them.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Romans, Lucretius and Manilius
may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to be the chief of the Dida&s;calic
poets. They both wrote with all the fire of their
youth about 'em; for neither of them liv'd to be old.
I have always fancy'd Manilius imitated Lucretius in
his manner, the beginning of his books being pretty
much in the &s;ame way, be&s;ides, that he lo&s;es no oc|ca&s;ion
of launching out into de&s;criptions, and is
florid to a fault. He has likewi&s;e &s;ome reflections<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The beginning of the fourth book.</NOTE> on
the follies of men, &s;o very much of a piece with what
you meet with in the 5th book of Lucretius, that one
would almo&s;t think them taken from thence. In
general it may be &s;aid, they are both very noble poems,
tho' that of Manilius is far from being fini&s;h'd, as it
might have been, if the author had liv'd. What
errors are to be found in the philo&s;ophy of the one,
<PB N="62" REF="81">
and the a&s;tronomy of the other, are owing, perhaps,
as much to the age of the world at that time, as
their own, and their beauties may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
atone for their faults.</P>
<P>Virgil's Georgics are in the &s;ame kind, tho' the
&s;ubjects are of le&s;s dignity; and I don't know whe|ther
I might not likewi&s;e add Ovid, on the account
of his Fa&s;ti, the mo&s;t correct of all his works:
Gratius too, about the &s;ame time, wrote his Cynege|tics,
which are very ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the moderns, Fraca&s;torius's <HI>Syphilis,</HI> Quil|let's
<HI>Callipaedia,</HI> and Vida's Art of Poetry, are the
be&s;t poems of this &s;ort; Rapin of gardens, and
Vanier's <HI>Praedium Ru&s;ticum,</HI> are not without their
merit, but much inferior to the others. In our own
language too we have &s;ome poems of this in&s;tructive
kind: The E&s;&s;ays on Poetry, Tran&s;lated Ver&s;e, and
Critici&s;m, are fine in&s;tances of the worth and excel|lency
of this manner of writing, to which may be
very truly apply'd what Dr. Young &s;ays of Satyr,<Q><L>" Heroes and gods make other poems fine,</L>
<L>" Plain &s;atyr calls for &s;en&s;e in every line<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Univer&s;al Pa&s;&s;ion, Sat. II.</NOTE>."</L></Q> The &s;trength of ju&s;t ob&s;ervations, convey'd in &s;mooth
and flowing numbers, has a prevailing influence,
in&s;inuates it&s;elf into the mind almo&s;t imperceptibly,
and makes a more la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion there than one
would ea&s;ily imagine. 'Tis true the&s;e &s;ubjects are
purely critical, and &s;o of le&s;s con&s;equence to man|kind
<PB N="63" REF="82">
in general; but yet, poli&s;hing the under&s;tand|ing,
improving the judgment, and regulating the
ta&s;te, are far from being things indifferent to the
world, &s;ince they tend not a little to the &s;haming
out of it that ru&s;ticity and barbari&s;m, tho&s;e follies
and affectations, in one word, all that littlene&s;s of
mind which is &s;o effectual a bar in the way of ge|nerous
and noble undertakings. But we have had of
late an undeniable proof that the fine&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;e|ful
&s;ort of philo&s;ophy, which con&s;i&s;ts in the know|ledge
of our&s;elves, may be convey'd in &s;uch clear,
&s;trong, ea&s;y, and affecting &s;trains, at the &s;ame time
convincing and captivating the under&s;tanding, that
there remains no doubt but that poetry in the hands
of a great genius, may be made as beneficial as ever
it has been entertaining to mankind. The latter
effect is indeed what has been generally mo&s;t aim'd at,
as it is compa&s;s'd with le&s;s difficulty to the writer, and
meets with a more univer&s;al reception among&s;t the
common &s;ort of readers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>&mdash;Nec in turbam nec turbae carmina condam.</L>
<BIBL>MANIL. L. II.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> Imagery, fine colour|ing,
and bright antithe&s;es, often di&s;gui&s;e the want of
ju&s;tne&s;s and force, and by plea&s;ing the imagination,
do, as it were, &s;teal away from the judgment, or
&s;ometimes impo&s;e upon it, as &s;hadows pa&s;s for &s;ub|&s;tances
with weak, di&s;temper'd or fanciful men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Os magna &s;onaturum</HI> of Horace would make
one almo&s;t think the mu&s;e mu&s;t never appear without
<PB N="64" REF="83">
her bu&s;kins, and that all &s;implicity of expre&s;&s;ion were
to be totally bani&s;h'd out of poetical writings. 'Tis
true, the Epic Poem, the Ode, and the Tragedy very
often require, and con&s;equently ju&s;tify the u&s;e of ele|vated
language, as it may be more &s;uitable to the
greatne&s;s of the &s;ubjects, and better fitted to rai&s;e the
&s;everal pa&s;&s;ions they are de&s;ign'd to work upon. But
where the appeal lies only to the under&s;tanding, &s;elf|evident
truths, naturally and beautifully expre&s;s'd, can
never fail of the approbation of a &s;ound head and a
good ta&s;te: And even Horace him&s;elf, as elevated
and great a poet as he mu&s;t be allow'd in his <HI>Odes,</HI>
appears to much more advantage in his <HI>Sermones</HI> and
<HI>Epi&s;tles,</HI> where, as my Lord Ro&s;common ob&s;erves on
another occa&s;ion,<Q><L>" Fancy labours le&s;s, but judgment more."</L></Q></P>
<P>Sir John Denham's Cooper's Hill has met with
univer&s;al applau&s;e, tho' its &s;ubject &s;eems rather de|&s;criptive
than in&s;tructing; but 'tis not the hill, the
river, nor the &s;tag chace; 'tis the good &s;en&s;e and the
fine reflections &s;o frequently inter&s;pers'd, and as it were
interwoven with the re&s;t, that gives it the value, and
will make it, as was &s;aid of true wit, everla&s;ting like
the &s;un.</P>
<P>The late Mr. Prior's Solomon &s;eems to have co&s;t
him much time and pains, and was, I believe, his
favourite performance: He is in &s;ome doubt whe|ther
to call it a Dida&s;calic or Heroic poem. It has,
<PB N="65" REF="84">
indeed, &s;omething of both, and yet &s;trictly &s;peaking,
is perfectly neither: It has not fable, machinery,
nor variety enough to be an Heroic poem, and it is
too diffu&s;ive and luxuriant in the &s;tyle, too florid
and full of de&s;criptions to be of the Dida&s;calic &s;ort.
In general, it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid to be a very fine
piece; though I mu&s;t confe&s;s I cannot help giving the
preference to his Alma, in which the de&s;ign is more
clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, carried on with more &s;pirit, and
never lo&s;es your attention.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, what Mr. Dryden has &s;aid in the
preface to his <HI>Religio Laici,</HI> is, I think, very true.
<Q REND="inline">"The expre&s;&s;ions of a poem, de&s;ign'd purely for
in&s;truction, ought to be plain and natural, and
yet maje&s;tic: for here the poet is pre&s;um'd to
be a kind of lawgiver, and tho&s;e three qualities
which I have named, are proper to the legi&s;lative
&s;tyle. The florid, elevated and figurative way,
is for the pa&s;&s;ions; for love and hatred, fear and
anger are begotten in the &s;oul by &s;hewing their
objects out of their true proportion; either greater
than the life or le&s;s; but in&s;truction is to be given
by &s;hewing them what they naturally are. A man
is to be cheated into pa&s;&s;ion, but to be rea&s;oned
into truth."</Q></P>
<P>The following &s;hort piece may be perhaps a little
too pompou&s;ly introduced by the foregoing ob&s;er|vations;
all I &s;hall &s;ay for it is, I endeavoured to
<PB N="66" REF="85">
follow Mr. Dryden's rules: how far I have &s;ucceeded,
I can be no proper judge my&s;elf. But whatever may
be &s;aid of the poetry, and about that I am very indif|ferent,
the &s;entiments mu&s;t &s;urely be allowed to be
ju&s;t and good; and I am entirely of Mr. Prior's opi|nion:
<Q REND="inline">"I had rather be thought a good Engli&s;hman,
(which is but another word for an hone&s;t man)
than the be&s;t poet, or greate&s;t &s;cholar that ever
wrote."</Q></P>

<HEAD>Mr. JOHN PHILIPS's de&s;igned Dedication to his Poem called THE SPLENDID
SHILLING.</HEAD>
<HEAD>To W. BROME, E&s;q. of <HI>Ewithington,</HI> in the County of
<HI>Hereford.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT would be too tedious an under|taking
at this time to examine the ri&s;e and progre&s;s
of Dedications. The u&s;e of them is certainly an|cient,
as appears both from Greek and Latin authors;
and we have rea&s;on to believe that it was continued
without any interruption till the beginning of this
century, at which time, mottos, anagrams, and
fronti&s;pieces being introduced, Dedications were
mightily di&s;couraged, and at la&s;t abdicated. But to
di&s;cover preci&s;ely when they were re&s;tored, and by
whom they were fir&s;t u&s;her'd in, is a work that far
tran&s;cends my knowledge; a work that can ju&s;tly
be expected from no other pen but that of your
opero&s;e Doctor Bentley. Let us therefore at pre&s;ent
acquie&s;ce in the dubiou&s;ne&s;s of their antiquity, and
think the authority of the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent times a
<PB N="189" REF="208">
&s;ufficient plea for your patronizing, and my dedi|cating
this poem. E&s;pecially &s;ince in this age Dedi|cations
are not only fa&s;hionable, but almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary;
and indeed they are now &s;o much in vogue, that a
book without one, is as &s;eldom &s;een as a bawdy-hou&s;e
without a Practice of Piety, or a poet with money.
Upon this account, Sir, tho&s;e who have no friends,
dedicate to all good chri&s;tians; &s;ome to their book|&s;ellers;
&s;ome for want of a &s;ublunary patron to the
manes of a departed one. There are, that have de|dicated
to their whores: God help tho&s;e hen-peck'd
writers that have been forced to dedicate to their own
wives! but while I talk &s;o much of other mens
patrons, I have forgot my own; and &s;eem rather to
make an e&s;&s;ay on Dedications, than to write one.
However, Sir, I pre&s;ume you will pardon me for
that fault; and perhaps like me the better for &s;aying
nothing to the purpo&s;e. You, Sir, are a per&s;on
more tender of other mens reputation than your own;
and would hear every body commended but your&s;elf.
Should I but mention your &s;kill in turning, and the
compa&s;&s;ion you &s;hew'd to my fingers ends when you
<PB N="190" REF="209">
gave me a tobacco &s;topper, you would blu&s;h and be
confounded with your ju&s;t prai&s;es. How much more
would you, &s;hould I tell you what a progre&s;s you
have made in that ab&s;tru&s;e and u&s;eful language, the
Saxon? Since, therefore, the recital of your excel|lencies
would prove &s;o trouble&s;ome, I &s;hall offend
your mode&s;ty no longer. Give me leave to &s;peak a
word or two concerning the poem, and I have done.
This poem, Sir, if we con&s;ider the moral, the new|ne&s;s
of the &s;ubject, the variety of images, and the
exactne&s;s of the &s;imilitudes that compo&s;e it, mu&s;t
be allowed a piece that was never equalled by the
moderns or ancients. The &s;ubject of the poem is
my&s;elf, a &s;ubject never yet handled by any poets.
How it to be handled by all, we may learn by tho&s;e
few divine commendatory ver&s;es written by the ad|mirable
Mon&s;ieur le Bog. Yet &s;ince I am the &s;ub|ject,
and the poet too, I &s;hall &s;ay no more of it,
le&s;t I &s;hould &s;eem vain-glorious. As for the moral,
I have took particular care that it &s;hould lie in|cognito,
not like the ancients who let you know at
fir&s;t &s;ight they de&s;ign &s;omething by their ver&s;es. But
<PB N="191" REF="210">
here you may look a good while, and perhaps, after
all, find that the poet has no aim or de&s;ign, which
mu&s;t needs be a diverting &s;urprize to the reader.
What &s;hall I &s;ay of the &s;imiles that are &s;o full of
geography, that you mu&s;t get a Wel&s;hman to un|der&s;tand
them? that &s;o rai&s;e our ideas of the things
they are apply'd to? that are &s;o extraordinarily quaint
and well cho&s;en that there's nothing like them? So
that I think I may, without vanity, &s;ay <HI>Avia Pieri|dum
peragro loca, &amp;c.</HI> Yet however excellent this
poem is, in the reading of it you will find a va&s;t dif|ference
between &s;ome parts and others; which pro|ceeds
not from your humble &s;ervant's negligence, but
diet. This poem was begun when he had little
victuals, and no moneys, and was fini&s;hed when he
had the misfortune at a virtuous lady's hou&s;e to meet
with both. But I hope, in time, Sir, when hunger
and poverty &s;hall once more be my companions, to
make amends for the defaults of this poem, by an
e&s;&s;ay on Minced Pies, which &s;hall be devoted to you
with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, by,</P>

<P>PRAY inform my Lord Harley that
I have on Thur&s;day la&s;t &s;een the daughter of Milton
the poet. I carry'd with me two or three different
<PB N="196" REF="215">
prints of Milton's picture, which &s;he immediately
knew to be like her father; and told me her mother-in-law
(if living in Che&s;hire) had two pictures of
him, one when he was a &s;chool boy, and the other
when he was about twenty. She knows of no other
picture of him, becau&s;e &s;he was &s;everal years in
Ireland, both before and after his death. She was
the younge&s;t of Milton's daughters by his fir&s;t wife,
and was taught to read to her father &s;everal languages.</P>
<P>Mr. Addi&s;on was de&s;irous to &s;ee her once, and
de&s;ired &s;he would bring with her te&s;timonials of be|ing
Milton's daughter, but as &s;oon as &s;he came into
the room he told her &s;he needed none, her face
having much of the likene&s;s of the pictures he had
&s;een of him.</P>
<P>For my part, I find the features of her face very
much like the prints. I &s;howed her the painting I
have to engrave, which &s;he believes not to be her
father's picture, it being of a brown complexion,
and black hair, and curled locks. On the contrary,
he was of a fair complexion, a little red in his
cheeks, and light brown lank hair.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="216">
I de&s;ire you would acquaint Mr. Prior I was &s;o
unfortunate to wait on him on Thur&s;day morning
la&s;t, ju&s;t after he was gone out of town. It was
with the intent to enquire of him if he remembers
a picture of Milton in the late Lord Dor&s;et's col|lection,
as I am told this was; or if he can inform
me how I &s;hall enquire or know the truth of this
affair, I &s;hould be much obliged to him, being very
willing to have all the certainty on that account
before I begin to engrave the plate, that it may be

even one I like &s;o much as Mrs. H. to have a &s;hare
in cau&s;ing it. I challenge a kind of relation to you
on the <HI>&s;oul's</HI> &s;ide, which I take to be better than
either on a father's or mother's; and if you can
overlook an ugly <HI>body</HI> (that &s;tands much in the way
of any friend&s;hip, when it is between different &s;exes)
I &s;hall hope to find you a true and con&s;tant kin&s;wo|man
in Apollo. Not that I would place all my
preten&s;ions upon that poetical foot, much le&s;s con|fine
them to it; I am far more de&s;irous to be ad|mitted
<PB N="202" REF="221">
as yours, on the more meritorious title of
friend&s;hip. I have ever believed this as a &s;acred
maxim, that the mo&s;t ingenious natures were the
mo&s;t &s;incere; and the mo&s;t knowing and &s;en&s;ible
minds made the be&s;t friends. Of all tho&s;e that I
have thought it the felicity of my life to know, I
have ever found the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed in capacity,
the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed in morality: and tho&s;e the
mo&s;t to be depended on, whom one e&s;teemed &s;o
much as to de&s;ire they &s;hould be &s;o. I beg you to
make me no more compliments. I could make you
a great many, but I know you neither need them,
nor can like them: be &s;o good as to think I do not.
In one word, your writings are very good, and very
entertaining; but not &s;o good, nor &s;o entertaining,
as your life and conver&s;ation. One is but the effect
and emanation of the other. It will always be a
greater plea&s;ure to me, to know you are well, than
that you write well, though every time you tell me
the one, I mu&s;t know the other. I am willing to
&s;pare your mode&s;ty; and therefore, as to your wri|ting,
may perhaps never &s;ay more (directly to your|&s;elf)
than the few ver&s;es I &s;end here; which (as a
<PB N="203" REF="222">

<P>THOUGH I am extremely obliged
by your agreeable letter, I will avoid all mention of
the plea&s;ure you give me, that we may have no more
words about compliments; which I have often ob|&s;erved
people talk them&s;elves into, while they en|deavour
to talk them&s;elves out of. It is not more
the diet of friend&s;hip and e&s;teem, than a few thin
wafers and marmalade were of &s;o hearty a &s;tomach
as Sancho's. In a word, I am very proud of my
new relation, and like Parna&s;&s;us much the better,
&s;ince I found I had &s;o good a neighbour there. Mrs.
H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, who lives at court, &s;hall teach two country-folks
&s;incerity; and when I am &s;o happy as to meet
you, &s;he &s;hall &s;ettle the proportions of that regard,
or good-nature, which &s;he can allow you to &s;pare
me, from a heart, which is &s;o much her own as
yours is.</P>
<P>That lady is the mo&s;t tru&s;ty of friends, if the
imitation of Shake&s;pear be yours; for &s;he made me
<PB N="205" REF="224">
give my opinion of it with a&s;&s;urance it was none of
Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. I hone&s;tly liked and prai&s;ed it, who&s;e|&s;oever
it was; there is in it a &s;en&s;ible melancholy,
and too true a picture of human life; &s;o true an
one, that I can &s;carce wi&s;h the ver&s;es yours at the
expence of your thinking that way, &s;o early. I
rather wi&s;h you may love the town (which the
author of tho&s;e lines cannot <HI>immoderately</HI> do) the&s;e
many years. It is time enough to like, or affect to
like, the country, when one is out of love with all
but one's-&s;elf, and therefore &s;tudies to become agree|able
or ea&s;y to one's-&s;elf. Retiring into one's-&s;elf
is generally the <HI>pis-aller</HI> of mankind. Would you
have me de&s;cribe my &s;olitude and grotto to you?
What if, after a long and painted de&s;cription of
them in ver&s;e (which the writer I have ju&s;t been
&s;peaking of could better make, if I can gue&s;s by
that line,
<Q><L>No noi&s;e but water, ever friend to thought)</L></Q>
what if it ended thus?
<Q><L>What are the falling rills, the pendant &s;hades,</L>
<L>The morning bow'rs, the evening colonnades:</L>
<L><PB N="206" REF="225">
But &s;oft rece&s;&s;es for th' unea&s;y mind,</L>
<L>To &s;igh un-heard in, to the pa&s;&s;ing wind!</L>
<L>So! the &s;truck deer, in &s;ome &s;eque&s;ter'd part,</L>
<L>Lies down to die (the arrow in his heart);</L>
<L>There hid in &s;hades, and wa&s;ting day by day,</L>
<L>Inly he bleeds, and pants his &s;oul away.</L></Q>
If the&s;e lines want poetry, they do not want &s;en&s;e.
God Almighty long pre&s;erve you from a feeling of
them! The book you mention, Bruyere's Characters,
will make any one know the world; and I believe
at the &s;ame time de&s;pi&s;e it (which is a &s;ign it will
make one know it thoroughly). It is certainly the
proof of a ma&s;ter-hand, that can give &s;uch &s;triking
likene&s;&s;es, in &s;uch &s;light &s;ketches, and in &s;o &s;ew
&s;trokes on each &s;ubject. In an&s;wer to your que&s;tion
about Shake&s;pear, the book is about a quarter printed,
and the number of emendations very great. I have
never indulged my own conjectures, but kept meerly
to &s;uch amendments as are authorized by old editions,
in the author's life-time: but I think it will be a
year at lea&s;t before the whole work can be fini&s;hed.
In reply to your very hand&s;ome (I wi&s;h it were a very

That you are determined to write no more&mdash;It is

You have &s;poiled him for a &s;olitaire, and a book,

of nothing but after a per&s;on who has nothing to &s;ay

ever again regarding, or plea&s;ing, or entertaining
him, much le&s;s of &s;eeing him. He has been &s;o mad

tho&s;e relating to you. I am &s;en&s;ibly obliged by you,
in the comfort you endeavour to give me upon the

this morning, that ju&s;t makes the drooping trees
hold up their heads, but they remain checked and
withered at the root: the benediction is but a &s;hort
relief, though it comes from Heaven it&s;elf. The
lo&s;s of a friend is the lo&s;s of life; after that is gone
from us, it is all but a gentler decay, and wa&s;ting
and lingering a little longer. I was the other day
<PB N="212" REF="231">
forming a wi&s;h for a lady's happine&s;s, upon her

<P>YOUR la&s;t letter tells me, that if
I do not write in le&s;s than a month, you will fancy
the length of yours frighted me. A con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
that I had upon me of omitting too long to an&s;wer
it, made me look (not without &s;ome fear and trem|bling)
for the date of it: but there happened to be
none; and I hope, either that you have forgot how
long it is, or at lea&s;t that you cannot think it &s;o
long as I do, &s;ince I writ to you. Indeed a multi|tude
of things (which &s;ingly &s;eem trifles, and yet
all together make a va&s;t deal of bu&s;ine&s;s, and wholly
take up that time which we ought to value above all
&s;uch things) have from day to day made me wanting,
as well to my own greate&s;t plea&s;ure in this, as to my
own greate&s;t concerns in other points. If I &s;eem to
neglect any friend I have, I do more than &s;eem to
neglect my&s;elf, as I find daily by the increa&s;ing ill
con&s;titution of my body and mind. I &s;till re&s;olve
this cour&s;e &s;hall not, nay I &s;ee it cannot, be long;
<PB N="215" REF="234">
and I determine to retreat within my&s;elf to the only
bu&s;ine&s;s I was born for, and which I am only good
for (if I am entitled to u&s;e that phra&s;e for any thing).
It is great folly to &s;acrifice one's &s;elf, one's time,
one's quiet (the very life of life it&s;elf), to forms,
complai&s;ances, and amu&s;ements, which do not in|wardly
plea&s;e me, and only plea&s;e a &s;ort of people
who regard me no farther than a meer in&s;trument of
their pre&s;ent idlene&s;s, or vanity. To &s;ay truth, the
lives of tho&s;e we call great and happy are divided
between tho&s;e two &s;tates; and in each of them, we
poetical fiddlers make but part of their plea&s;ure, or
of their equipage. And the mi&s;ery is, we, in our
turns, are &s;o vain (at lea&s;t I have been &s;o) as to
chu&s;e to pipe without being paid, and &s;o &s;illy to be
plea&s;ed with piping to tho&s;e who under&s;tand mu&s;ick
le&s;s than our&s;elves. They have put me of late upon
a ta&s;k before I was aware, which I am <HI>&s;ick</HI> and <HI>&s;ore</HI>
of: and yet engaged in honour to &s;ome per&s;ons
whom I mu&s;t neither di&s;obey nor di&s;appoint (I mean
two or three in the world only) to go on with it.
They make me do as mean a thing as the greate&s;t
<PB N="216" REF="235">
man of them could do; &s;eem to depend, and to
&s;olicit, when I do not want; and make a kind of
court to tho&s;e above my rank, ju&s;t as they do to
tho&s;e above theirs, when we might much more wi&s;e|ly
and agreeably live of our&s;elves, and to our&s;elves.
You will ea&s;ily find I am talking of my tran&s;lating
the Ody&s;&s;ey by &s;ub&s;cription: which looks, it mu&s;t
needs look, to all the world as a de&s;ign of mine both
upon fame and money, when in truth I believe I
&s;hall get neither; for one I go about without any
&s;tomach, and the other I &s;hall not go about at all.</P>
<P>This freedom of opening my mind upon my own
&s;ituation, will be a proof of tru&s;t, and of an opi|nion
your goodne&s;s of nature has made me entertain,
that you never profe&s;s any degree of good-will with|out
being pretty warm in it. So I tell you my griev|ances;
I hope in God you have none, wherewith to
make me any return of this kind. I hope that was
the only one which you communicated in your la&s;t,
about Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> &s;ilence; for which &s;he wanted
not reproaches from me; and has &s;ince, &s;he &s;ays,
amply atoned for. I &s;aw a few lines of yours to her,
<PB N="217" REF="236">
which are more obliging to me than I could have

per&s;on, of either &s;ex, will never wi&s;h for many), I
ought to be a happier man than I ever yet de&s;erved
to be.</P>
<P>Upon a review of your papers, I have repented of
&s;ome of the trivial alterations I had thought of,
which were very few. I would rather keep them till
I have the &s;atisfaction to meet you in the winter,
which I mu&s;t beg earne&s;tly to do; for hitherto me|thinks
you are to me like a &s;pirit of another world,

<P>IT happened that when I determined
to an&s;wer yours, by the po&s;t that followed my re|ceipt
of it, I was prevented from the fir&s;t proof I
have had the happine&s;s to give you of my warmth
and readine&s;s, in returning the epitaph, with my
&s;incere condolements with you on that melancholy
&s;ubject. But neverthele&s;s I re&s;olved to &s;end you the
one, though unattended by the other: I begged Mrs.
H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> to inclo&s;e it, that you might at lea&s;t &s;ee I
had not the power to delay a moment the doing what
you bid me; e&s;pecially when the occa&s;ion of obeying
your commands was &s;uch, as mu&s;t affect every ad|mirer
and well-wi&s;her of honour and virtue in the
nation.</P>
<P>You had it in the very blots, the better to com|pare
the places; and I can only &s;ay it was done to
the be&s;t of my judgement, and to the extent of my
&s;incerity.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="241">
I do not wonder that you decline the poetical
amu&s;ement I propo&s;ed to you, at this time. I know
(from what little I know of your heart) enough at
lea&s;t to convince me, it mu&s;t be too deeply concerned
at the lo&s;s, not only of &s;o great, and &s;o near a rela|tion;
but of a good man (a lo&s;s this age can hardly
ever afford to bear, and not often can &s;u&s;tain). Yet
perhaps it is one of the be&s;t things that can be &s;aid
of poetry, that it helps us to pa&s;s over the toils
and troubles of this tire&s;ome journey, our life; as
hor&s;es are encouraged and &s;pirited up, the better to
bear their labour, by the jingling of bells about
their heads. Indeed, as to my&s;elf, I have been u&s;ed
to this odd cordial, &s;o long, that it has no effect
upon me: but you, Madam, are in your honey|moon
of poetry; you have &s;een only the &s;miles, and
enjoyed the care&s;&s;es, of Apollo. Nothing is &s;o
plea&s;ant to a Mu&s;e as the fir&s;t children of the Ima|gination;
but when once &s;he comes to find it meer
conjugal duty, and the care of her numerous progeny
daily grows upon her, it is all a &s;our tax for pa&s;t
plea&s;ure. As the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays on another occa&s;ion,
the age of a Mu&s;e is &s;carce above five and twenty:
<PB N="223" REF="242">
all the re&s;t is labour and &s;orrow. I find by experi|ence
that his own fiddle is no great plea&s;ure to a com|mon
fiddler, after once the fir&s;t good conceit of
him&s;elf is lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I long at la&s;t to be acquainted with you; and Mrs.
H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> tells me you &s;hall &s;oon be in town, and I ble&s;t
with the vi&s;ion I have &s;o long de&s;ired. Pray believe
I wor&s;hip you as much, and &s;end my addre&s;&s;es to you
as often, as to any female Saint in Heaven: it is
certain I &s;ee you as little, unle&s;s it be in my &s;leep;
and that way too, holy hermits are vi&s;ited by the
Saints them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I am, without figures and metaphors, yours: and
hope you will think, I have &s;pent all my fiction in
my poetry; &s;o that I have nothing but plain truth
left for my pro&s;e; with which I am ever,</P>

<P>I Think it a full proof of that unlucky

that this fir&s;t, this only day that I &s;hould

ill) to go out &s;o far, and lie on a bed at my doctor's

<P>AFTER a very long expectation
and daily hopes of the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing and
conver&s;ing with you, I am &s;till deprived of it in a
manner that is the mo&s;t afflicting, becau&s;e it is oc|ca&s;ioned
by your illne&s;s and your misfortune. I can
bear my own, I a&s;&s;ure you, much better: and thus
to find you lo&s;t to me, at the time that I hoped to
have regained you, doubles the concern I &s;hould
naturally feel in being deprived of any plea&s;ure
whatever.</P>
<P>Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> can be&s;t expre&s;s to you the concern of
a friend, who e&s;teems and pities: for &s;he has the
liberty to expre&s;s it in her actions, and the &s;atisfac|tion
of attending on you in your indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h &s;incerely your condition were not &s;uch as
to debar me from telling you in per&s;on how truly I
am yours. I wi&s;h I could do you any little offices of
friend&s;hip, or give you any amu&s;ements, or help you
to what people in your pre&s;ent &s;tate mo&s;t want,
better &s;pirits. If reading to you, or writing to you,
<PB N="226" REF="245">
could contribute to entertain your hours, or to rai&s;e
you to a livelier reli&s;h of life, how well &s;hould I
think my time employed! indeed I &s;hould, and think
it a much better end of my poor &s;tudies, than all
the vanities of fame, or views of a character that
way, which engage mo&s;t men of my fraternity.</P>
<P>If you thoroughly knew the zeal with which I
am your &s;ervant, you would take &s;ome notice of the
advice I would give you, and &s;uffer it to have a
weight with you proportionable to the &s;incerity with
which it is given.</P>
<P>I beg you to do your utmo&s;t to call to you all the &s;uc|cours,
which your own good &s;en&s;e and natural reflexion
can &s;ugge&s;t, to avoid a melancholy way of thinking,
and to throw up your &s;pirits by intervals of moderate
company; not to let your di&s;temper fix it&s;elf upon
your mind at lea&s;t, though it will not entirely quit
your body. Do not indulge too much &s;olitarine&s;s.
Though mo&s;t company be not proper or &s;upportable
during your illne&s;s, force your&s;elf to enter into &s;uch
as is good and rea&s;onable, where you may have your
liberty, and be under no re&s;traint.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="246">
Why will you not come to your friend Mrs.
H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, &s;ince you are able to go out, and &s;ince motion
is certainly good for your health? Why will you not
make any little &s;ets of &s;uch as you are ea&s;ie&s;t with, to
&s;it with you &s;ometimes?</P>
<P>Do not think I have any intere&s;ted aim in this advice:
though I long to &s;ee you, and to try to amu&s;e you, I
would not for the world be con&s;idered as one that would
ever require for my own gratification, any thing that
might be improper or hurtful to you.</P>
<P>Pray let me know, by our friend Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, if there
can be anything in my power to &s;erve, or to amu&s;e you.
But u&s;e me &s;o kindly, as not to think ever of writing to
me till you are &s;o well as that I may &s;ee you, and then
it will be needle&s;s. Do not even read this, if it be
the lea&s;t trouble to your eyes or head.</P>

good wi&s;hes for your &s;peedy recovery,</P>

<P>IT was an inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure to me
to &s;ee your letter, as I a&s;&s;ure you it had long been a
great trouble, to reflect on the melancholy rea&s;on of
your &s;ilence and ab&s;ence. It was that only which
hindered my writing, not only again, but often, to
you; for fear your good-nature &s;hould have been
prompted to oblige me too much at your own ex|pence,
by an&s;wering. Indeed I never expre&s;&s;ed (and
never &s;hall be able to expre&s;s) more concern and good
wi&s;hes for you, than I &s;hall ever feel for one of your

<P>I am &s;orry, the moment you grow better, to have

her &s;ex, to be there immediately. I cannot but
wonder you have not heard from her, though I
&s;hould wonder if any body el&s;e had; for I am told
by her family &s;he has had much of the head-ake at
Bath, be&s;ides the excu&s;e of a great giddine&s;s occa|&s;ioned
naturally by the waters. I writ to her at the
fir&s;t going, and have not had a word from her; and
now you tell me the &s;ame thing, I conclude &s;he has
been wor&s;e than I imagine. I hear &s;he returns on
Wedne&s;day, when I &s;hall have the &s;atisfaction (I
doubt not) to talk and hear a great deal of Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could &s;ay any thing, either to comfort
you when ill, or entertain you when well. Though
nothing could, in the proper proportion of friend|&s;hip,
more affect me than your condition; I have
not wanted other occa&s;ions of great melancholy, of
which the lea&s;t is the lo&s;s of part of my fortune by

<P>IT would be a vanity in me to tell you
why I trouble you &s;o &s;oon again: I cannot imagine
my&s;elf of the number of tho&s;e corre&s;pondents whom
you call favourite ones; yet I know it is thought,
that indu&s;try may make a man what merit cannot:
and if an old maxim of my Lord Oxford's be true,
That in England if a man re&s;olve to be any thing,
and con&s;tantly &s;tick to it, he may (even a Lord
Trea&s;urer): if &s;o, I &s;ay, it &s;hall not be want of re|&s;olution
that &s;hall hinder me from being a favourite.
In good earne&s;t, I am more ambitious of being &s;o
to you, Madam, than I ever was, or ever &s;hall be,
of being one to any Prince, or (which is more) any
Prince's mini&s;ter, in Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could tell you any agreeable news of what
your heart is concerned in; but I have a &s;ort of
quarrel to Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> for not loving her&s;elf &s;o well
as &s;he does her friends: for tho&s;e &s;he makes happy,
but not her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="251">
There is an air of &s;adne&s;s about her which grieves
me, and which, I have learnt by experience, will
increa&s;e upon an indolent (I will not &s;ay an affected)
re&s;ignation to it. It will do &s;o in men, and much
more in women, who have a natural &s;oftne&s;s that
&s;inks them even when rea&s;on does not. This I tell
you in confidence; and pray give our friend &s;uch
hints as may put her out of humour with melan|choly:
your cen&s;ure, or even your raillery, may
have more weight with her than mine: a man can|not
either &s;o decently, or &s;o delicately, take upon
him to be a phy&s;ician in the&s;e concealed di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Madam, I proceed in tru&s;ting you with
things that nearly concern me. In my la&s;t letter I
&s;poke but of a trifle, my&s;elf: in this I advance
farther, and &s;peak of what touches me more, a
friend.</P>
<P>This beautiful &s;ea&s;on will rai&s;e up &s;o many rural
images and de&s;criptions in a poetical mind, that I
expect, you, and all &s;uch as you (if there be any
&s;uch), at lea&s;t all who are not downright dull tran&s;|lators,
<PB N="233" REF="252">
like your &s;ervant, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be pro|ductive

<L>And the fir&s;t Pope (immortal Phoebus) &s;ung,</L>

<L>Bold ri&s;ing hills, &s;lant vales, and far-&s;tretch'd plains,</L>

<L>The &s;oothing murmur of the falling floods,</L>
<L>A nobler boa&s;t, a higher glory yield,</L>

<L>All that can charm the eye, or plea&s;e the ear,</L>
<L>Says, Harmony it&s;elf inhabits here.</L></Q></NOTE> BEDINGTON: I could wi&s;h you tried &s;omething
in the de&s;criptive way on any &s;ubject you plea&s;e,
mixed with vi&s;ion and moral; like pieces of the old
proven&ccedil;al poets, which abound with fancy, and are
the mo&s;t amu&s;ing &s;cenes in nature. There are three
or four of this kind in Chaucer admirable: "The
Flower and the Leaf" every body has been de|lighted
with.</P>
<P>I have long had an inclination to tell a Fairy tale,
the more wild and exotic the better; therefore a
<PB N="234" REF="253">
<HI>vi&s;ion,</HI> which is confined to no rules of probability,
will take in all the variety and luxuriancy of de|&s;cription
you will; provided there be an apparent
moral to it. I think, one or two of the Per&s;ian
Tales would give one hints for &s;uch an invention:
and perhaps if the &s;cenes were taken from real places
that are known, in order to compliment particular
gardens and buildings of a fine ta&s;te (as I believe
&s;everal of Chaucer's de&s;criptions do, though it is
what nobody has ob&s;erved), it would add great
beauty to the whole.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you found &s;uch an amu&s;ement plea&s;ing to
you: if you did but, at lei&s;ure, form de&s;criptions
from objects in nature it&s;elf, which &s;truck you mo&s;t
livelily, I would undertake to find a tale that &s;hould
bring them all together: which you will think an
odd undertaking, but in a piece of this fanciful and
imaginary nature I am &s;ure is practicable. Excu&s;e
