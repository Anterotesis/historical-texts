<HEAD>THE
Di&s;&s;enters An&s;wer
TO THE
High-Church Challenge.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is the Character of the Devil to
bring a Railing Accu&s;ation, &s;o no
Man of Sence or Manners cares to
imitate him; all Men of Learning,
that ever I met with, will allow that People
may Differ, Debate and Di&s;pute, without <HI>Bil|ling&s;gate</HI>
Language; that Invidious Names,
and Indecent Reproaches, &s;erve to gratifie the
Spleen, and flow from a Redundancy of Gall
in the Author, but add no manner of Force
to his Argument; good Words are as &s;trenu|ous
as bad; and the Satyr lyes in the Truth,
not the ill Language, of the Book.</P>
<P>From this Principle, the Author of a late
Pamphlet, with a Title as long as a Book,
and call'd, <HI>The Wolf Stript,</HI> mu&s;t not expect a
Return of Dirt for Dirt; and while he calls
every Man by his Name, and yet is a&s;ham'd of
<PB N="4" REF="4">
his own, calls mo&s;t Men out of their Names,
and fills his Book with the Exuberance of his
Hypochondriack Vapours, he ought to be look'd
upon as an Author not worth while to med|dle
with; if a Gentleman &s;hould fight with
a Chimney-&s;weeper, he may beat the Man,
but he will daub him&s;elf &s;o much, will &s;tink
of the Soot, and foul his Cloaths, that the
Victory is not worth the Di&s;order 'twill put
him into.</P>
<P>In like manner, he that will deal with this
Author in his own Way, mu&s;t foul his Mouth
with &s;o much Bear-Garden Language, &s;uch
rude, unmannerly, and un&s;cholar-like, Beha|viour,
that he mu&s;t be tainted with the un|grateful
Savour of his Enemy's Malignancy,
and look like the Man he meddles with as not
worth any Man's while.</P>
<P>Upon this Account I &s;hall not meddle with
his Voluminous Tract it &s;elf; but as he has
made a fair Challenge in the Eighth Page of his
Book to all the Di&s;&s;enters, I am willing to en|ter
a little in the Ca&s;e; not &s;o much expect|ing
to &s;ilence a Tongue pointed with Raillery,
but to let the World know that the Di&s;&s;enters
are not unprovided with &s;trong Arguments to
defend a ju&s;t Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The Challenge that this Gentleman has
made to the World, and of which he &s;eems &s;o
very confident, is as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">
The <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> make a Heavy <HI>Noi&s;e,</HI> That the
<HI>Church</HI> will not Purcha&s;e a <HI>Reconciliation,</HI> with
the giving up only of a few <HI>Indifferent</HI> Things,
which Offend their Tender <HI>Con&s;ciences.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Low-Church</HI> lay the Blame upon the
<HI>High-Church,</HI> (with very &s;evere <HI>Reflections</HI>)
That they are <HI>Ob&s;tructers</HI> of this Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P>Now let none of the&s;e be <HI>Judges</HI> in their own <HI>Cau&s;e.</HI>
Therefore let the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> give in to the Pre&s;ent
<HI>Convocation</HI> a <HI>Li&s;t</HI> of &s;uch <HI>Indifferent</HI> Things,
which, if <HI>Granted,</HI> they will <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> to <HI>Conform,</HI>
and Heal the <HI>Schi&s;m.</HI> The <HI>Scruples</HI> are <HI>Theirs.</HI>
Therefore they mu&s;t make the <HI>Propo&s;al.</HI> None others
can tell what will <HI>Satisfie</HI> them.</P>
<P>If they will not do this, Let them &s;top their <HI>Cla|mours,</HI>
and Never more &s;ay, That nothing will be
<HI>Granted</HI> them! And that the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>
has no mind to Heal the <HI>Schi&s;m!</HI></P>
<P>But if they will do this, then it will appear, Whe|ther
the <HI>High</HI> or the <HI>Low-Church</HI> will go Farthe&s;t
to Purcha&s;e this De&s;ir'd <HI>Reconciliation;</HI> and which
of them do, in good Earne&s;t, Wi&s;h it, and not rather
to keep open the <HI>Breach,</HI> to &s;erve other <HI>De&s;igns!</HI></P>
<P>Next, let tho&s;e of the <HI>Convocation,</HI> who were for|merly
Imploy'd in this Grand <HI>Project</HI> of <HI>Reconcilia|tion,</HI>
(of which they have made &s;uch Boa&s;ts) lay
before the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> the Grounds and the Terms of it;
that it may appear they were none but <HI>Indifferent</HI>
Things, which were to be Given up to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters!</HI>
Otherwi&s;e, let Them too <HI>Cea&s;e</HI> their <HI>Railing</HI> at the
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<HI>High-Church,</HI> as Men of Violent Spirits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
for <HI>Ob&s;tructing</HI> their <HI>De&s;igns!</HI> Or, for <HI>Su&s;pect|ing</HI>
what-they were!</P>
<P>The <HI>High-Church</HI> De&s;ire, That they, and the
<HI>Low-Church,</HI> and the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> too, may be
<HI>Try'd</HI> by their <HI>Actions,</HI> and not by the <HI>Clamours</HI>
on either Side. And that they may be Heard <HI>Pub|lickly,</HI>
in the Face of the World, by the <HI>Method</HI>
Propos'd.</P>
<P>And Whoever <HI>Refu&s;e</HI> this, and cannot Propo&s;e a
more <HI>Rational</HI> and <HI>Convincing</HI> Way, for the
<HI>Clearing</HI> of <HI>Them&s;elves,</HI> let <HI>Them</HI> be <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>Had this been a new Challenge, this Author
might have had &s;ome Rea&s;on to have expected
it &s;hould have been accepted and replied to.</P>
<P>But &s;ince I find his Reading as &s;hort as his
Cen&s;ure is ha&s;ty, I think the propere&s;t Me|thod
is to revi&s;e what of this Kind has been
already done, and to put him in Mind that all
he has &s;aid only ends in this Ab&s;urdity of
arguing, <HI>viz.</HI> The Di&s;&s;enters have alrea|dy
been challeng'd to this, have accepted the
Challenge, undertaken the Defence of
their Doctrine, and of their Di&s;&s;enting, have
effectually vindicated them&s;elves from the
Charge of Schi&s;m, given Rea&s;ons for
their Scruples, and made Propo&s;als for Con|formity;
they have challeng'd the Church to
Union and Peace, they have defended them|&s;elves
<PB N="7" REF="7">
from the Charge of Di&s;loyalty and Re|bellion,
and offered the Church to bring their
Loyalty to the Te&s;t with them; and none of
the&s;e things have ever been An&s;wer'd, or &s;ome
of them not &s;o much as Reply'd to.</P>
<P>Now as this Gentleman &s;upplies Matter
of Fact with Indecency and Railery, I &s;hall
not need to follow him there; he begins the
very fir&s;t Page of his Book with Three po&s;itive
Fal&s;ities, neither of which he can in the lea&s;t
tollerable manner make out.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That they have a Society of
Writers.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the Di&s;&s;enters find them|&s;elves
wor&s;ted in Argument.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Page he tells us, <HI>Tis the Method
of the Di&s;&s;enters not to mind any An&s;wer, but to
repeat and repeat their own Objections</HI> IN INFI|NITUM.</P>
<P>'Tis
far from my De&s;ign to Reply to a Book
as full of Ab&s;urdities and Contradictions as
it is Verbo&s;e and Malignant, and therefore I
&s;hall content my &s;elf with the&s;e Three In&s;tan|ces.</P>
<P>1.
As to the Di&s;&s;enters having a Society of
Writers, I am &s;o well &s;atisfied of its being a
Forgery of his own, that I Challenge him to
<PB N="8" REF="8">
make appear that there is &s;o much as a Cor|re&s;pondence
among them of any Two toge|ther
that have ever Wrote in the Behalf of
the Di&s;&s;enters; and as he is mighty forward
to print Names, and to abu&s;e them by Name
too, he is welcome to &s;et down their Names
if he can: In which, if he pur&s;ue his u&s;ual
Method of pre&s;uming things are &s;o, and then
affirming it as po&s;itively as if he cou'd prove
it, he will certainly En&s;nare and Expo&s;e him|&s;elf
as much in the Particulars as he has
done now in the General.</P>
<P>Had the Di&s;&s;enters &s;o much Unanimity
among them&s;elves, as he pretends they have,
they would have too great a &s;hare in the Pub|lick
Regard, to let &s;uch a hard-mouth'd
Author Treat them in &s;o Scurrilous a Manner
as he does; the Government would &s;uppre&s;s
the Spirit of Railery in the Mouths of the&s;e
Enflamers, that they &s;hould not have
&s;uch a full Liberty of Traducing and Abu|&s;ing
their Bretheren, in order to keep open
the Breach, which 'tis every True <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pro|te&s;tant's
De&s;ire and Intere&s;t to &s;ee heal'd.</P>
<P>No, Sir, the Di&s;&s;enters have no &s;uch So|cieties;
the Spirit of Union, <HI>the more &V;n|happy
for them,</HI> is not &s;o much among them;
they are all forward enough to have any Bo|dy
&s;erve them, but it mu&s;t be at their own
Hazard, and at their own Expence, which a
<PB N="9" REF="9">
late unhappy Author of theirs very lately
had Experience of enough to warn any Man
from venturing to &s;erve them again.</P>
<P>But therefore, Sir, is it plain that this Book
is far from being Wrote as a De&s;ign of the Par|ty,
but with the Sence of Truth, which eve|ry
Hone&s;t Man has a Right to Vindicate.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, Sir, I affirm your Party
has, and ever had, a Society of Writers; and
whenever you de&s;ire it, I am ready to gratifie
you with &s;ome of their Names; tho' I am not
forward of printing Names, as a piece of Rude|ne&s;s
unbecoming an Author: But a certain
Weekly Paper now in Cour&s;e is Publickly
own'd to be &s;o wrote; and I know Per&s;onal|ly,
that the wretched Performance has occa|&s;ion'd
&s;ome Con&s;iderations among People of
greater Capacities, to provide a Set of Men
to do it better, and to gratifie them for the
Service.</P>
<P>But, Sir, I &s;hall not enter upon the tedi|ous
Work of Recrimination, as a thing in
which there is &s;o much room for launching
out, that the compa&s;s of this &s;mall Tract
would be too &s;traight for it.</P>
<P>2. You tell us, <HI>The Faction,</HI> which is your
Civil Term for the Di&s;&s;enters, <HI>find them&s;elves
wor&s;ted in Argument.</HI></P>
<P>It had been time enough to have boa&s;ted thus
when you had put your Armour off, and
<PB N="10" REF="10">
when the many Tracts wrote by the Di&s;&s;en|ters
in their own ju&s;t Vindication have been
An&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>But this Gentleman has the Misfortune &s;o
to be blinded by his Pa&s;&s;ion, as to cry <HI>Victoria</HI>
before the Battle is ended; and not to trouble
you, Sir, with many Negatives, I wi&s;h you
would let us &s;ee <HI>one Time</HI> whenever by any
thing but Railery you <HI>wor&s;ted</HI> the Di&s;&s;en|ters.</P>
<P>We
confe&s;s, Sir, that at ill Language you
have the better of us; whether you have any
Profe&s;&s;ors of the Scolding Talent among your
Students we know not, for you will not
&s;uffer us to be Taught in your Univer&s;ities;
but we a&s;&s;ure you, that in tho&s;e Schools where
we are fain to bring up our Youth, we Teach
no &s;uch Science.</P>
<P>But as if all you had laid down on that
Head were true, and you were very cer|tain
that you had wor&s;ted the Di&s;&s;enters in
Argument, you give them a home Charge.</P>
<P>3. That <HI>'tis their Method not to mind An&s;wers,
but to Repeat and Repeat their own Objections</HI> In
Infinitum.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, This may or may not be true,
according as you can or cannot give a Ge|nuine
An&s;wer to the following Account of
An&s;wers given, and Books written; by Di&s;|&s;enters
in their own Vindication, which you,
<PB N="11" REF="11">
nor any of your Church, have ever yet
thought fit to venture an An&s;wer to, and
<HI>when you can</HI> you may defend your Church
from unfair Treatment of the Di&s;&s;enters in
point of Argument on this Head.</P>
<P>And not to go too far beyond the Memory
of tho&s;e we are talking to, I think there
&s;tands Two Books of the Learned Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on</HI>
yet unan&s;wered, the one Entituled, <HI>No Scrip|ture
Evidence for Dioce&s;ian Bi&s;hops;</HI> and the other,
<HI>A Di&s;cour&s;e of Liturgies.</HI> 'Tis true, there is a
long and learned Di&s;cour&s;e of Dr. <HI>Comber</HI>'s
then <HI>Precentor</HI> of <HI>York,</HI> wherein with &s;ome of
our Author's Spirit, Treating the Memory of
Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on</HI> neither like a Gentleman nor a
Scholar, tho' all Men know he was as much
of both as ever the Nation bred; and tho' a
Di&s;&s;enter, had the Honour to be Tutor to
the Learned and mo&s;t Excellent Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI>
late Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>After this Author has plea&s;ed him&s;elf with
&s;ufficiently reproaching his Decea&s;ed Antago|ni&s;t,
he goes on to rummage Antiquity to
prove that Liturgies were in u&s;e in the Primi|tive
Church. This was no part of the Di&s;|pute;
and had not the Doctor overlook'd it in
his ha&s;te, Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on</HI> had Anticipated his
whole Di&s;cour&s;e in <HI>p.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">. <Q REND="inline">'Whether Liturgies,
or Forms of Wor&s;hip and Admini&s;tration,
<PB N="12" REF="12">
were in u&s;e in the Primitive Church or not,
is no part of the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'But whether the&s;e Liturgies were pre|&s;crib'd
and Impos'd as Terms of Communion
this is the Que&s;tion.' </Q></P>
<P>Now to this Que&s;tion the Dr. is not pleas'd
to &s;ay one Word, as I can ob&s;erve, in his whole
Book, but goes on to prove that to be true
which Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on</HI> granted, and lets that a|lone
which he deny'd.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;o Ridiculous was this An&s;werer in
the Management of him&s;elf, both in the
Search of Antiquity, and in rendring tho&s;e
Authors he Quotes, that a Learned Mini&s;ter
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> meerly with a re|&s;pect
to Ju&s;tice and Learning, Reply'd to
him, and made it appear that the Doctor did
not &s;o much as under&s;tand the Language of
the Quotations. This was Mr. <HI>Samuel Bold,</HI>
Rector of <HI>Steeples</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>This, I &s;uppo&s;e, is &s;ome Peoples Way of
An&s;wering the Di&s;&s;enters; and if this may
pa&s;s for An&s;wering, they are An&s;wer'd in|deed:
But I mu&s;t take the Freedom to &s;ay, It
has yet remain'd unprov'd, that ever a &s;trict
Literal Compliance to any Pre&s;crib'd Form
of Wor&s;hip and Admini&s;tration of Sacraments
was Impos'd as the Term or Condition of
Communion in any Branch of the Chri&s;tian
Church, for above 400 Years after our Sa|viour's
<PB N="13" REF="13">
time; nay, 'twould be hard to prove
it ever done in any Church in the World but
ours to this Day; and they are &s;till welcome to
make it out if they can; and till they do, the
World may judge whether the Di&s;&s;enters are
<HI>wor&s;ted in Argument,</HI> or no.</P>
<P>That there were Bi&s;hops in the Primitive
Church has al&s;o been defended with a great
deal of Skill; but as to their Dioce&s;an Royal|ty
and Juridiction, they have always, in Pru|dence,
thought fit to let the Di&s;pute of it a|lone;
and I would advi&s;e them to do &s;o &s;till,
for they mu&s;t find &s;ome other Book to defend
it from than the Scripture, and &s;ome other
Ages of the World to &s;earch for the Practice in
than that of the Primitive Church</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t confe&s;s the Di&s;&s;enters were
wor&s;ted another Way, in the Ca&s;e of Dr.
<HI>Calamy</HI> and Mr. <HI>Delaun;</HI> of which remarkable
Story this is the &s;hort Ab&s;tract.</P>
<P><HI>Dr.</HI> Calamy <HI>preaching a Sermon at</HI> Alderman|bury
<HI>Church, Entituled,</HI> A Di&s;cour&s;e about Scru|pulous
Con&s;ciences, <HI>makes the Di&s;&s;enters this fair
Challenge, as by his printed Sermon,</HI> P.  <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.
<HI>appears in the&s;e Words:</HI> Could we but prevail
with the People diligently to examine the Merits of
the Cau&s;e our Church would every Day gain Ground
among&s;t all wi&s;e Men; for we care not how much
Knowledge and &V;nder&s;tanding our People have, &s;o they
be but Humble and Mode&s;t with it: Nor do we de&s;ire
<PB N="14" REF="14">
Men to become our Pro&s;elites any farther than we
give them Scripture for it. <HI>And in another Place
he goes on;</HI> All we de&s;ire of the Di&s;&s;enters is, that
they would equally hear both Sides; that they would
weigh and con&s;ider the Arguments that may be propound|ed
to them; and being indifferent to either Part of the
Que&s;tion, would think it no Shame to change their Mind
when they &s;ee good Rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Delaun,</HI> a Man who&s;e Learning and
Temper were Con&s;picuous to all the Learn|ed
World, and particularly in the Book he
wrote, accepts this Challenge, and writes
down his Rea&s;ons for Nonconformity; and
as the Doctor had printed his Sermon, and
thereby appeal'd to the World, all Peoples
Mouths were fill'd with the Fairne&s;s of the
Propo&s;al, and every Body cry'd out, the Di&s;|&s;enters
were wor&s;ted, Mr. <HI>Delaun</HI> therefore
thought him&s;elf oblig'd to print his Reply.</P>
<P>But as the Victory con&s;i&s;ted, as it does &s;till,
in Boa&s;ts and Rhodomontades, &s;o they were
as loth to be overcome, as &s;en&s;ible that they
&s;hould be &s;o, and took immediate Care to
&s;uppre&s;s the Book, by &s;eizing the Copy at the
Printer's; and this was follow'd, by &s;eizing
the Author for writing a Seditious Libel, put
him in Pri&s;on, fin'd him <HI>&V;ltra Tenementum,</HI> and
were hardly prevail'd upon to vouch&s;afe him
the Favour to excu&s;e him the Pillory, which
<PB N="15" REF="15">
they at la&s;t told him in Court was only re|mitted
in re&s;pect to his Learning.</P>
<P>Here was a true Church-Conque&s;t; and this
Gentleman was per&s;ecuted with &s;o much true
Church Zeal, that he lay in <HI>Newgate</HI> for his
Fine, till he, his Wife and Children, died there,
to the Eternal Scandal both of the Church-man
and the Di&s;&s;enters; the one, that he &s;hould
fir&s;t challenge a Di&s;pute, and then &s;o ba&s;ely
Treat the Man that accepted it; and the o|ther,
that they &s;hould not contribute 75 <HI>l.</HI> to
&s;ave a Life &s;acrific'd for their Defence; and
&s;uch a Life, as, for real Merit, de&s;erv'd infi|nitely
more Regard in a Nation of Humanity
and Religion, as we fancy our &s;elves to be.</P>
<P>The Book for which this Gentleman was
thus handl'd remains to this Day unan&s;wer'd
by the&s;e People, that boa&s;t &s;o much of <HI>wor&s;t|ing
the Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and they would do well
to look back upon that Book, and make &s;ome
rational Reply to it before they tell us we can
&s;hew no Rea&s;ons for our Di&s;&s;enting.</P>
<P>In like manner they proceed &s;till with the
Di&s;&s;enters upon other Points of arguing, as
particularly by <HI>Repealing and Repeating In Infini|tum</HI>
the Charge of Rebellion and Faction,
whereas they have been over and over Chal|leng'd
make out their own Loyalty of
Principles or Practice to exceed the Loyalty
of the Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="16">
And <HI>De Foe</HI>'s <HI>Te&s;t of the Church of</HI> England's
<HI>Loyalty</HI> has receiv'd yet no other An&s;wer than
his <HI>Shorte&s;t Way,</HI> by a Fine <HI>&V;ltra Tenement<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">m,</HI>
and the reproachful An&s;wer of <HI>the Pillory.</HI> If
this be your Way of an&s;wering Arguments,
Gentlemen, 'tis no wonder you can wor&s;t the
Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>To proceed in their u&s;ual Method, a worthy
Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons has pub|li&s;h'd
a Book to vindicate the Occa&s;ional Bill;
and, like tho&s;e who take Things upon Tru&s;t,
has affirm'd, that all wi&s;e Nations in the World
have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to entru&s;t the Ad|mini&s;tration
of Publick Affairs in the Hands
of &s;uch Per&s;ons only as are of one and the
&s;ame Per&s;ua&s;ion in Matters of Religion.</P>
<P>A very hand&s;ome Way of calling all the
Chri&s;tian World Fools: For I defie him to
&s;hew me one of tho&s;e wi&s;e Nations, and to
prove it by one In&s;tance, unle&s;s where there
has not been any Toleration of other Per&s;ua|&s;ions,
the Turks only Excepted.</P>
<P>Thus, Gentlemen, we are wor&s;ted by For|geries
and Fal&s;ities, not by Arguments; we
are challeng'd to Di&s;pute, and then ruin'd for
Di&s;puting; ask'd Que&s;tions, and then fetch'd
up for An&s;wering them. But &s;ince this Gen|tleman
has found an Adver&s;ary capable to deal
with him, <HI>Power and P&mdash;ts excepted,</HI> I leave
<PB N="17" REF="17">
him to &s;ay the Di&s;&s;enters are wor&s;ted, when
he proves it by a &s;ufficient Reply.</P>
<P>We are now challeng'd to prove that we
di&s;&s;ent from the Church in Points &s;o far from
being e&s;&s;ential, as that the Chnrch cannot be
ju&s;tified in Refu&s;ing to abate them; and
we are de&s;ir'd to give in the Objections to the
Convocation.</P>
<P>What Authority their Author has from the
Convocation to make this Offer, I know not,
and do not &s;ee how I &s;hall know it; or whe|ther
the Convocation will receive &s;uch a Li&s;t
of the indifferent things, or no; but &s;ince
this bold Challenger would be an&s;wered, and
will not be &s;atisfied with a General Reply,
but this mu&s;t be &s;poken to by it &s;elf, I crave
leave to accept his Challenge as far as the fol|lowing
Particulars reach.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I do affirm this has been done alrea|dy
by the whole Body of the Di&s;&s;enting Mi|ni&s;ters
in &s;uch a Manner, and with &s;uch mo|de&s;t
Rea&s;ons, as &s;everal of the Epi&s;copal Cler|gy
were &s;o &s;atisfied with, and did &s;o repre|&s;ent
to King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, that their
Conce&s;&s;ions were a &s;ufficient Ground of a U|nion:
VVhat, and who, hindred a Union
when the Di&s;&s;enters made &s;uch Conce&s;&s;ions,
I leave to this Gentleman to tell us, if he
cares to expo&s;e his Friends &s;o much.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="18">
Secondly, I do affirm, that if the Church of
<HI>England</HI> would think fit &s;o far to &s;toop to
their Di&s;&s;enting Brethren, as to abate <HI>&s;uch
things only,</HI> and <HI>all &s;uch,</HI> as are acknowledg'd by
them&s;elves to be Indifferent; if it would not
reduce us all to &s;uch a perfect Union as to
Comprehend all Parties, it would yet Em|brace
&s;o many in the Arms of the Church:
'Twould cau&s;e &s;o many to return to the
Church among the Di&s;&s;enters, as would
render the Remainder le&s;s con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>I am to &s;uppo&s;e the Challenger in this
Matter does not expect I &s;hould give in &s;uch
a Li&s;t of Alterations as would Reconcile the
Quakers, or perhaps not all other Societies;
or to tell him what Sorts would Conform,
and what would not: But I an&s;wer him in
Rea&s;on, if I &s;ay for my &s;elf, that upon &s;uch
Conce&s;&s;ions I would Conform with all my
Heart, and Thou&s;ands more, I believe, would
do the like.</P>
<P>Since then he has made &s;uch an Offer, let
us Examine what it is we de&s;ire of the
Church, what are the Indifferent Things
we differ about, and <HI>I join I&s;&s;ue with him</HI> if the
Convocation thinks fit to make the&s;e Abate|ments
and Amendments, and we refu&s;e to
Conform, then I am content we &s;hall pa&s;s
<PB N="19" REF="19">
for a People who are willing to keep open
the Breach to &s;erve other De&s;igns.</P>
<P>Before I de&s;cend to the Particulars, 'tis
nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome Enquiry into what
I call Indifferent.</P>
<P>1. I call tho&s;e Things Indifferent which
are not E&s;&s;ential Points of Doctrine, with|out
the Belief or Practice whereof a Man
cannot obtain Salvation.</P>
<P>2. All things introduc'd into the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> either in Wor&s;hip or in Di&s;ci|pline,
by Humane In&s;titution, which are
not to be found either by Command or by
Pre&s;ident in the Holy Scriptures, <HI>which are
the Rule of our Faith.</HI></P>
<P>On this Head of Indifferent Things there|fore
I join I&s;&s;ue with our Author; and if he
thinks fit to pre&s;ent our Humble Addre&s;s to
the Convocation, that they will be pleas'd
to make &s;uch Abatement in the Indifferent
Things following, I am per&s;uaded &s;uch
Multitudes of Di&s;&s;enters will come into the
Church as may very well de&s;erve the Name
of a Union, tho' not of an Univer&s;al Con|formity,
and the Number of Remaining Di&s;|centers
would be much the &s;maller.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="20">
Fir&s;t of all as to Liturgies, we de&s;ire,
&s;ince it is all Originally Humane, and made
by Men Fallible, and of like Pa&s;&s;ions with our
&s;elves, they may &s;uffer &s;uch Amendment as
are Rea&s;onable and Ju&s;tifiable from Scrip|ture,
and the Practice of the Primitive
Church.</P>
<P>Secondly, We de&s;ire that after &s;uch Amend|ment,
the Mini&s;ter may not in all Ca&s;es be
Ti'd up and Pre&s;crib'd by the Letter of the
Book, but may have Liberty to Expre&s;s
him&s;elf at large in Prayer, as the pre&s;ent Exi|gence
of the Ca&s;e may require, and his own
Abilities may &s;upply.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We de&s;ire the Ordination of Mi|ni&s;ters
by Presbyters may be allow'd, being
Ju&s;tifiable by Scripture; and that our Mini|&s;ters
may be admitted into Holy Orders with|out
the Re-ordination, and Impo&s;ing of Unrea|&s;onable
Oaths.</P>
<P>Fourthly, We de&s;ire the Kneeling at the
Sacrament, Bowing at the Name of Je&s;us, the
Cro&s;s in Bapti&s;m, the U&s;e of the Surplice,
and all tho&s;e Things own'd by the Greate&s;t
Ma&s;ters of the Di&s;pute to be Indifferent, may
either be wholly left out, or &s;o left at the
Di&s;cretion of the People, as that they may
not be impos'd upon them without their
Con&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="21">
Fifthly, We de&s;ire the Epi&s;copal Hierarchy
to be Reduc'd to &s;uch a Pitch of Authority as
may be ju&s;tified by the Scripture, and to no
other; and we are ready to enter into an Ex|amination
with them, what that Particu|lar
of Power amounts to, and how far it ex|tends.</P>
<P>I
do not &s;ay the&s;e are all the Heads which
I &s;uppo&s;e the Di&s;&s;enters require, but I &s;ay
the&s;e are &s;ome of them, and the mo&s;t Con&s;i|derable;
and if the Church would give &s;uch
Conce&s;&s;ions as were Rea&s;onable on the&s;e
Heads, the Controver&s;ie would &s;oon be de|cided,
Whether the Di&s;&s;enters Separated from
the E&s;tabli&s;hed Church on frivolous Grounds,
or no.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, As to Alterations in the Liturgy,
'tis the Avow'd Opinion of the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> that no Church in the World is in|fallible;
and above all, our Church does not
pretend to the Title. If then we are not In|fallible,
but &s;ubject to Err and Mi&s;take, why
&s;hould &s;he refu&s;e to Enter into the Cau&s;e,
whether it is convenient to make any farther
or more perfect Reformation or no; but tho'
the Con&s;ideration were not on a farther Refor|mation,
yet if it were only giving up &s;ome
<PB N="22" REF="22">
&s;maller Matter for the &s;ake of Chri&s;tian Peace,
it were not Commendable only, but a Due
Requi&s;ite Temper in a Chri&s;tian Church.</P>
<P>As to them that blame the Di&s;&s;enters for
Separating, let us enquire of them <HI>if they are
uncapable of greater Light,</HI> and con&s;equently
of knowing better what they ought to do,
than they did before? If then they will &s;up|pre&s;s
this Light, and refu&s;e to Amend
Things, tho' the Light of their own Con&s;ci|ence
directs them to it, where lyes the
Charge of Schi&s;m? Surely not at their Door,
who would only pur&s;ue a perfect Reformati|on,
and think it their Duty to &s;erve God in the
VVay mo&s;t agreeable to his Revealed VVill
in the Scriptures; but at theirs, who would
oblige them to wor&s;hip him according to the
Inventions of Men, by Forms and Methods,
for which they have neither Warrant, Com|mand,
of Example, either in the Scripture, or
the Primitive Practice of the Church; I Appeal
to all the World, that as well now as before it is
not our Faults that they bring the Liturgy
upon the Stage of Di&s;pute, but the bold
Challengers of Men that can never make
good their Arguments: And they ought fir&s;t
to have An&s;wered what has been &s;aid already,
before they had Challeng'd us to &s;how New
Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23">
Wherefore in the Sen&s;e fir&s;t of the
Irre&s;i&s;table Force of what has been &s;aid alrea|dy,
and &s;econdly of my Incapacity of &s;aying
more to the Purpo&s;e, at lea&s;t in &s;o &s;hort a

the Bi&s;hops refu&s;ed it, <HI>Baxt. Life,</HI> cap. 8.</P>
<P>4. If they plea&s;e to Reply (<HI>a little more to
the Purpo&s;e</HI> than Mr. <HI>Osfley</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hoadly has

in the 10th Chapter of <HI>Baxter</HI>'s <HI>Life,
Abridg'd</HI> by Mr. <HI>Calamy,</HI> and to &s;ome yet Un|an&s;wered
Things in Mr. <HI>Calamy</HI>'s <HI>Reply</HI> to
Mr. <HI>Hoadly.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="24">
5. If they plea&s;e to give a Rational An|&s;wer

by a Member of their own Church, and to
<HI>Gille&s;py</HI>'s <HI>View of Engli&s;h Popi&s;h Ceremonies.</HI></P>
<P>Whenever the&s;e things are Soberly and Ju|diciou&s;ly
An&s;wered, and as Dr. <HI>Calamy</HI> pro|po&s;ed
good Scripture and Rea&s;on brought for
it, a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, Sir, when the&s;e Things
are An&s;wered, there &s;hall be no manner of
need to bring an Occa&s;ional Bill to prevent
the Alternate Conformity of Di&s;&s;enters; 'tis
mo&s;t certain, that the far greater Number of
them will come in, and become your Chri|&s;tian
United Brethren; and till you do the&s;e
Things, Gentlemen, we Appeal to all the
World, who are the Cau&s;ers of the Schi&s;m
you &s;peak of, tho&s;e that all along offered to
come in upon Rea&s;onable Conditions, or tho&s;e
that have per&s;ecuted us for not complying
with Humane In&s;titutions, which are no
where to be found in Scripture, <HI>which is the
only Rule of Faith.</HI></P>
<P>And thus now the World may &s;ee with
what Truth the&s;e Gentlemen blacken the Di&s;|&s;enters
<HI>with their Repeating Objections, but taking
no notice of An&s;wers,</HI> which I here fairly return
upon them, and a&s;&s;ure them, that whenever
<PB N="25" REF="25">
they will An&s;wer the Objections in Mr. <HI>De
Laun</HI>'s Book again&s;t the Liturgy and Canon
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and prove the &s;ame
to be nece&s;&s;ary from Scripture and Rea&s;on,
I will certainly Conform, for I believe and
own it my Duty to Conform to them if I can,
and I can never re&s;i&s;t Conforming to any thing
which is prov'd to be my Duty from Rea&s;on
and Scripture.</P>
<P>I think 'tis needle&s;s to &s;ay much of my
own, after &s;uch Men as the&s;e have appear'd
and gone off the Stage with no Reply; nei|ther
can I &s;atisfie my &s;elf to attempt any
thing by way of Addition to Men of &s;uch
exalted Learning, till I can &s;ee &s;omething
New offered upon the&s;e Heads, and unle&s;s
the&s;e Gentlemen have &s;omething to &s;ay more
than has been &s;aid before them by Men &s;u|perior
in Learning to them&s;elves: What they
now advance &s;avours of an Arrogance pecu|liar
to them&s;elves, and which I like &s;o ill,
that I care not to imitate.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore think it more than &s;uf|ficient
thus to tell them what has been &s;aid
already; and if they have any thing to &s;ay by
way of Reply, that demands an An&s;wer,
they may not want what is needful to ju&s;tifie
the Practice and Principles of the Di&s;&s;enters,
to be &s;uch as neither the Charge of Faction or
Rebellion can be laid at their Doors, and it

&s;eems by this Challenge he would let the
World believe that the Church of <HI>England</HI>
would not &s;tand with the Di&s;&s;enters for &s;mall
Matters; and I cannot but wonder with what
Face he can Publi&s;h to the World the&s;e fol|lowing
Words, which I am per&s;uaded he has
no Authority for from his Superiors.</P>
<P>We &s;hould have little Quarrel with the Di&s;&s;enters
about all the Objections they make as to Habits, Ce|remonies,
Liturgy, and even the Grand Point of Or|dination
by Presbyters in Ca&s;es of Nece&s;&s;ity; if it
were not for that Ful&s;ome Word Schi&s;m, if they did
not gather Separate Congregations, and &s;et them up
in Oppo&s;ition to the Church, and &s;o form a Schi&s;m, they
would be no Di&s;&s;enters, notwith&s;tanding their diffe|rent
Sentiments as to the Points before mentioned.
<HI>All the&s;e are his own Words, P.</HI> 3.</P>
<P><HI>Thou Hypocrite, out of thine own Mouth &s;halt thou
be condemned;</HI> If you had not Quarrell'd
with us about Habits, Ceremonies, Liturgy,
and Ordination, there had been no Schi&s;m;
no Separate Congregations gathered, no
breaking off from the Church, no &s;uch thing
as Di&s;&s;enters, at lea&s;t but few among us; and
to impo&s;e this upon the World after &s;uch
plain Evidence as has been given to the con|trary,
de&s;erves a cour&s;er Title than I care to
foul my Paper with, and evidently &s;hows the
Method of the Party who run down the Di&s;|&s;enters
by Fal&s;ities and Forgeries.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="27">
And that I may do what the&s;e People &s;el|dom
concern them&s;elves about; I lay it down
as a Truth, that when King <HI>Charles</HI> the Se|cond
was Re&s;tor'd to the Crown, the pre|&s;ent
Di&s;&s;enters being then de&s;ir'd to Conform
to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and their Mini&s;ters
having very good Inducement &s;o to do, <HI>viz.</HI>
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Livings and Benefices,
they were Commanded by the King to give in
their Propo&s;als upon which they would Con|form.</P>
<P>And
'tis needful to give a &s;hort Ab&s;tract of
the Proceedings in that Ca&s;e, in Order to let
the World &s;ee what occa&s;ion'd the Schi&s;m
the&s;e People cry &s;o much out of, and to place
the Guilt of it where it really lyes; for as the
Morality, &s;o the Immorality, of every Action
con&s;i&s;ts in the Principle from whence it pro|ceeds,
and the End to which it is de&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>At the Re&s;toration of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. to
put the Di&s;&s;enters in Hopes that a Reconcilia|tion
was intended, Ten or Twelve of the
Principal of them were made His Maje&s;ties
Chaplains; and the&s;e de&s;igning to improve
that Opportunity, waited upon him, intro|duc'd
by the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> and humbly
recommended to His Maje&s;ty the Happine&s;s,
and the Opportunity of a Union among his
Prote&s;tant Subjects in Matters of Religion,
<PB N="28" REF="28">
and begging of him that <HI>ONLY NECESSARY
THINGS might be the Terms of &V;nion.</HI></P>
<P>The King declar'd him&s;elf very favourably
on this Head, profe&s;s'd that the Propo&s;al was
exceeding agreeable to him, and promis'd
them to do his utmo&s;t to bring it to pa&s;s.
Telling them withal, <HI>That this Agreement cou'd
not be expected but by abating &s;omething on both Sides,
and meeting one another in the Mid-way; and that
if they were willing to do their Parts, if it was not
effected, it &s;hould be their own Faults, and not his.</HI></P>
<P>Here it may very well be ob&s;erv'd that
the Schi&s;m lyes directly at the Door of the
Church, <HI>if the King's Words are true.</HI> For the
Di&s;&s;enters did make Offers of meeting half
Way, and more than half Way, as &s;hall pre|&s;ently
be made out; and if our Brethren of
the Church can make out one Step offer'd by
them in the mo&s;t indifferent Circum&s;tance,
then ours is the Schi&s;m, and not theirs. If
not, <HI>Vae vobis Hypocritae.</HI> Job 15. 6. <HI>Thine own
Mouth condemneth thee, and not I; yea, thine own
Lips te&s;tifie again&s;t thee.</HI></P>
<P>The King after this directed, <HI>That they &s;hould
bring in Propo&s;als of the utmo&s;t they could yield to;</HI>
and they in return be&s;ought His Maje&s;ty,
That <HI>at the &s;ame time that they offer'd their Conce&s;&s;i|on

<P>According to this Direction of the King
they met and agreed upon a Paper, with a
mo&s;t Humble Addre&s;s to His Maje&s;ty, they
make Four Preliminary Reque&s;ts to the King,
and then offer'd their Propo&s;als, an Ab&s;tract of

<P>Fir&s;t, They reque&s;t, <HI>That &s;erious Godline&s;s might
be countenanced; a Learned and Pious Mini&s;ter in each
Pari&s;h encouraged; that a Per&s;onal, Publick, owning
the Bapti&s;mal Covenant might precede an Admi&s;&s;ion
to the Lord's Table; and that the Lord's Day might
be &s;trictly &s;anctified.</HI> They offer to allow of the
true, ancient, Primitive Precedency in the
Church, with a due Mixture of Presbyters,
in order to the avoiding the Corruptions,
Partiality, Tyranny, and other Evils, which
are incident to the Admini&s;tration of a &s;ingle
Per&s;on; the Things which they principally
blamed in the <HI>Engli&s;h Frame</HI> were the <HI>great Ex|tent
of the Bi&s;hops Dioce&s;s: Their deputing Commi&s;&s;a|ries,
Chancellors, and Officials, to act in their Stead:
Their a&s;&s;uming their &s;ole Power of Ordination and Ju|ri&s;diction,
and acting &s;o arbitrarily in Vi&s;itation Ar|ticles;</HI>
bringing in new Ceremonies, and &s;u|&s;pending
Mini&s;ters at Plea&s;ure: And for re|forming
<PB N="22" REF="30">
the&s;e Evils, they propo&s;ed, that <HI>Bi|&s;hop</HI>
U&s;her's <HI>Reduction of Epi&s;copacy unto the Form
of Synodical Government received in the ancient Church</HI>
&s;hould be the Ground-work of an Accommo|dation;
and that Suffragans &s;hould be cho&s;en
by the re&s;pective Synods: The A&s;&s;ociations
be of a moderate Extent; the Mini&s;ters to be
under no Oaths, or Promi&s;es of Obedience to
the Bi&s;hops, as being re&s;pon&s;ible for any
Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law; and that the Bi|&s;hops
govern not by Will and Plea&s;ure, but
according to Rules, Canons and Con&s;titutions,
that &s;hould be ratified and e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Act
of Parliament. As to the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> they own|ed
the Lawfulne&s;s of a pre&s;cribed Form of
Publick Wor&s;hip, but de&s;ired that &s;ome Learn|ed,
and Pious, and Moderate Divines of both
&s;orts might be employed either to compile a
new <HI>Liturgy,</HI> or to reform the old, adding &s;ome
other varying Forms in Scripture Phra&s;e, to
be u&s;ed at the Mini&s;ter's Choice. As to the
<HI>Ceremonies</HI> they humbly repre&s;ented, that the
Wor&s;hip of God was perfect without them;
that God hath declared him&s;elf in Matters of
Wor&s;hip a jealous God; that the Reformed
Churches abroad, mo&s;t of them rejected the
Ceremonies that were reclaimed here; that
here in <HI>England</HI> they had ever &s;ince the Re|formation
been Matters of Contention and
Di&s;pute; that they had occa&s;ioned the &s;ilen|cing
<PB N="23" REF="31">
of many Pious and U&s;eful Mini&s;ters,
and given Ri&s;e to many Separations from the
Church: That they were at be&s;t but indif|ferent,
and in there own Nature mutable;
and therefore they begg'd that kneeling at the
Sacrament might not be impo&s;ed, and that the
Surplice and the Cro&s;s in Bapti&s;m, and the
bowing at the Name of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> rather than
<HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or <HI>Emanuel,</HI> might be aboli&s;hed, and
that Care might be taken to prevent future
Innovations, contrary to Law; that &s;o the
Publick Wor&s;hip might be free, not only
from Blame, but Su&s;picion.</P>
<P>Does this look like a Propo&s;al from Men
that did not di&s;&s;ent, but upon Factious and
Politick Principles? 'Tis hard there &s;hou'd
be any Occa&s;ion to revive the Di&s;cour&s;e of

refre&s;h their Memory, and to &s;hew to the
World that this Schi&s;m and Separation of the
Di&s;&s;enters was wholly occa&s;ion'd by the

on the Con&s;equences of a &s;ingle Per|&s;on's
Admini&s;tration in the Church, was as
applicable to the Civil State. The <HI>Extent of

as being at be&s;t but a heap of Private Con|ceptions
The <HI>Liturgy</HI> they applaud as unex|ceptionable,
and think it can't be &s;aid to be
too Rigorou&s;ly impo&s;ed, when Mini&s;ters are
not denied the Exerci&s;e of their Gifts, in
Praying before and after Sermon; which Sort
of Praying, they declare however, is but the
continuance of a Cu&s;tom of no great Autho|rity,
and grown into Common u&s;e by Suffe|rance
only, without any other Foundation
in the Laws and Canons. The Revi&s;ing the
<HI>Liturgy</HI> neverthele&s;s they yield to, if his Ma|je&s;ty
thinks fit. As for the <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> they
could not part with one; not being able to
think that the Satisfaction of &s;ome Private
Per&s;ons was to be laid in Ballance again&s;t the
Publick Peace, and Uniformity of the
Church. Nay, were any Abatements made,
they are &s;atisfied unquiet Spirits would be

thereby encouraged to make further De|mands.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ecce
&s;ignum,</HI> here's the Foundation of the
Di&s;&s;enters Schi&s;m in Three Heads.</P>
<P>Epi&s;copal Hierarchy without Alteration.</P>
<P>Liturgy &V;nexceptionable, and impo&s;&s;ible to be too
Rigorou&s;ly Impos'd.</P>
<P>Ceremonies, not one to be parted with.</P>
<P>Pray, Gentlemen, how long have ye alter'd
your Minds, that you can now &s;ay <HI>you won't
quarrel with us for Habits, Ceremonies, or Ordina|tion;</HI>
and when we offer'd to agree with you
in every thing el&s;e, you would have <HI>your Ordi|nation
without Alteration,</HI> you would not part
with <HI>one of the Ceremonies;</HI> and thought <HI>your Litur|gy
&V;nexceptionable, and that it cou'd not be too Rigo|rou&s;ly
Impo&s;ed?</HI> How long is it &s;ince the&s;e Gen|tlemen
have been of a better Opinion? And
when all is done, how &s;hall we be &s;ure their
Propo&s;al is Genuine, while we have expe|rienc'd
&s;o much Fal&s;ity and ill-grounded Pa&s;|&s;ion,
as before?</P>
<P>Here now is the Picture of a High-Church
Challenge, to which we may very well An|&s;wer,
we are the &s;ame that we were when we
made the Propo&s;als to King <HI>Charles</HI> the Se|cond,
and we have a great deal of Rea&s;on to
believe you are the &s;ame too. <HI>Ill Nature &s;eldom
turns Changling.</HI> 'Tis true, you did promi&s;e us
<PB N="35" REF="35">
fine things, you promi&s;ed to come to a Tem|per
with the Di&s;&s;enters, and declar'd 'twas
your Principle to give an Ea&s;e to Con&s;ciences
truly Scrupulous; and upon this Foot you
obtain'd upon us to join with you in the Re|volution:
Now you talk of Hone&s;ty, pray,
Gentlemen, do us the Favour to let us know
in what you ever perform'd that Promi&s;e, and
when we are to expect it?</P>
<P>Now you &s;hall be put to Trial of your Ho|ne&s;ty
and Ju&s;tice, what Commi&s;&s;ion you had
from the Convocation to tell us you would
not Differ about <HI>Habits, Ceremonies, Liturgy</HI> and
<HI>Ordination,</HI> I know not, and believe you will
be puzzled to produce it: But I venture to &s;ay
to you from abundance of the Di&s;&s;enters, <HI>that
then you &s;hall differ with us for nothing;</HI> Remit
us the&s;e and we will Conform to you, and
be all One Church and One People.</P>
<P>'Tis about the&s;e Things Chiefly you Differ
with us; you have no Pretences but the&s;e
upon us: The Articles of Rebellion Forty
One; the <HI>Rye-Hou&s;e</HI> Plot, <HI>Ca&s;tares</HI>'s Evidences,
and more: We can allow you all the&s;e, and
many more than is true, and yet prove that
your Principles are as Di&s;loyal, and your
Practices have been as full of Rebellion, as
ours; you have made as many In&s;urrections
again&s;t the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Governors of the Na|tion
as we; you have made as many Factions
<PB N="36" REF="36">
again&s;t the Princes and the Laws, took up
Arms as often, kill'd as many Kings, or en|deavour'd
it, as we; and how often have you
been Challeng'd to come to a Te&s;t of your
Loyalty with us? But you are Proof again&s;t
Argument; and without taking notice of
the&s;e things, or of any thing el&s;e that &s;tands
again&s;t you, you <HI>Repeat and Repeat</HI> your
Railings, and &s;uffer your Tongues to Launch
out in a &s;en&s;le&s;s and in&s;ignificant manner,
<HI>In In&s;initum.</HI></P>
<P>And to help load the Di&s;&s;enters with In|famy,
you Charge them with all that has been
done in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where the Arbitrary Tyran|ny
of State Mini&s;ters oftentimes made the
People De&s;perate: No wonder if from &s;uch
Principles you can Charge them with Burn|ing
the City of <HI>London.</HI> One would think
the&s;e Gentlemens Pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould not make
them forget their Rea&s;on &s;o much as to expo&s;e
their Proceedings to their own Friends.</P>
<P>Did not the Committee of Parliament fix
the Firing of the City upon the <HI>Roman Catho|licks,</HI>
by the irre&s;i&s;table Te&s;timony of the
Per&s;ons concern'd; and why mu&s;t the Di&s;&s;en|ters
do it? Had you brought them by Per&s;e|cution
to &s;uch de&s;perate Fortunes, to &s;uch De|&s;pair,
as to &s;et Fire to their own Hou&s;es?
Were there not almo&s;t as many of them Burnt
out as of the Church?</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="37">
The ridiculous Fury of the&s;e Men is an
An&s;wer to them&s;elves; and upon the whole, I
offer to make out, That the Di&s;&s;enters have, on
all Occa&s;ions, behav'd them&s;elves with as much
Zeal for the Government, as much Sincerity
to the Soveraign, and as much Loyalty, as the
Church has done, let them begin the Debate
when they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, I'll prove, That the High
Church Party has tyranniz'd over them by all
the Illegal, Unchri&s;tian, Methods po&s;&s;ible, en|deavouring
to drive them to the Extremities
of De&s;pair and Rebellion.</P>
<P>I'll prove by the Preachings, Printings, and
declar'd Judgment, of &s;everal of the mo&s;t zea|lous,
High, Party, that however the Practice
was di&s;own'd by the Party, upon the un&s;ea&s;on|able
expo&s;ing it, by the Book, call'd, <HI>The Shorte&s;t
Way;</HI> yet that it has all along been their De|&s;ire,
and very often in their De&s;ign; and I ap|peal
for the Truth of it, among many In&s;tan|ces,
to a Letter of a known Church-man,
who&s;e Original I have by me, being wrote
to a Per&s;on who &s;ent him the Book for a Pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>SIR,</P>
<P>I
Received yours, and enclo&s;ed the Book, call'd, <HI>The
Shorte&s;t Way with the Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> for
which I thank you; and, next to the Holy Bible, and
<PB N="38" REF="38">
Sacred Comments, I place it as the most Valuable Thing
I can have. I look upon it as the only Method, and
I pray God to put it into the Heart of our most Graci|ous
Queen to put what is there propos'd in Execution.</P>
<P>Here is the Character of a High-Church|man
drawn to the Life; but when in a Po&s;t
or Two this Gentleman under&s;tood it was
wrote by a Di&s;&s;enter, in his next he &s;ends up
an Invidious Character of a Whig, and what
in his Opinion &s;uch a one de&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>And now, Gentlemen, would Rea&s;on and
Arguments &s;erve for a Reply to you, I &s;hould
go on with your voluminous Rap&s;ody of Scan|dal;
but really it is &s;o full of Rudene&s;s, and
Want of Manners, as well as Want of Truth,
that I chu&s;e to let it go, and return to your
Challenge about our Conformity; and this
you direct us to lay before the Convocation,
which I cannot but make &s;ome ju&s;t Excepti|ons
to.</P>
<P>1. I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to believe the Convo|cation
has given you any Authority to make
the Propo&s;al; I cannot but believe that the
Convocation knows too well what, and how
often, the Di&s;&s;enters have offer'd the very
Thing the&s;e Gentlemen propo&s;e; the Con|vocation
cannot be ignorant that all Propo&s;als
of Amendment and Abatement are Ungrate|ful
and Di&s;agreeable to the Temper of the&s;e
<PB N="39" REF="39">
High-Churchmen; and the Convocation could
not be guilty of &s;o much Imprudence to offer
that to us now, which we have &s;o often offer|ed
them to no Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>2. I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to believe the Convoca|tion
will perform the Conditions the&s;e Gen|tlemen
propo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> to abate the Habits, Ce|remonies,
Liturgies, and Ordination; and
therefore, Gentlemen, you are de&s;ired to take
back your own Words with this fair Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>Whenever the Church of <HI>England</HI> cea&s;es to
quarrel with us about Habits, Ceremonies, Li|turgies,
and Ordination, we are content that
tho&s;e Di&s;&s;enters which &s;hall after that refu&s;e
to Conform, may be taxed with being unwil|ling
to have the Breach healed, with being
ob&s;tinate Di&s;&s;enters, or what you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>'Tis an unaccountable A&s;&s;urance in any Au|thor
to advance &s;uch a Notion to the World;
in which, had they Power but of Reflection
on them&s;elves, they mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity &s;ee
they were in the Wrong.</P>
<P>Pray, Gentlemen, what do you think we
differ with you for? We hope you are Prote|&s;tants;
we have own'd you a true Church, and
that we differ from you in nothing Doctrinal,
or ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary for Salvation? Will
ye keep your Words with us? Then here is
your Challenge an&s;wer'd.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="40">
Get the Convocation to pa&s;s it into an Act,
that the Church will not quarrel with us a|bout
<HI>Habits, Ceremonies, Liturgies and Ordination,</HI>
the Schi&s;m be upon us if we do not Conform.</P>
<P>If you can't do this, then make us no more
Challenges, never write to us to tell you upon
what Terms we will Conform; we are ready
to Conform upon your own Terms; we take
you at your own Words; do but perform what
you have voluntarily propos'd, we are your
own.</P>
<P>Not but that we have great Rea&s;on to &s;ay,
we know very well that this Offer is neither
in your Power, nor in your Nature; not in
your Power, as private Men; not in the Na|ture
of your High Church, as a Party.</P>
<P>Nor is it any Breach of Charity to &s;ay &s;o,
becau&s;e we have had &s;o much Experience of
your Temper on all Occa&s;ions in this Matter;
and in particular, in the Conferences at the
<HI>Savoy,</HI> where the Di&s;&s;enters made all the Con|ce&s;&s;ions
of Charity and Obedience that they
were able to do with any Safety to their Con|&s;ciences;
they went through the Common-Prayer-Book,
and propos'd only &s;uch Amend|ment
as they found ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
make it tolerable to them and their Hearers;
they offer'd to di&s;pute upon the Amendments
they had made, and to ju&s;tifie all their Obje|ctions
by the Scriptures.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="41">
In a Word, they offer'd to Conform &s;o far
as they were able to an&s;wer it to God, their
Con&s;ciences, and the World; and he that re|quires
Men to offer more, or el&s;e rejects them,
and &s;huts them out of their Communion,
wou'd do well to tell us who are the Authors
of the Schi&s;m.</P>
<P>But after all, the&s;e Gentlemen, by what I
can perceive, are as ignorant in the thing they
call Schi&s;m, as they &s;eem to be in other Things;
and we have the Te&s;timony of the Hou&s;e of
Lords, in which there concurr'd mo&s;t of the
Bi&s;hops of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that <HI>the Di&s;|&s;enters
are not Schi&s;maticks.</HI> See the Rea&s;ons of
the Lords again&s;t the Bill to prevent <HI>Occa&s;ional
Conformity.</HI></P>
<P>And had the&s;e Gentlemen bethought them|&s;elves
when they charge us with this Schi&s;m,
for &s;eparating from the Church, they would
have reflected a little on Mr. <HI>Hales,</HI> of <HI>Eaton,</HI>
a Sober and Judicious Divine of the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> who in his Treati&s;e of Schi&s;m lets
them know, that &s;eparating in Communion
from any Particular Church is not a Schi&s;m,
if the Per&s;ons are not &s;eparated from the whole
Body of Chri&s;tians; but he that holds the
Head, holds fa&s;t the Faith, and does not di|vide
in Faith and Doctrine, cannot be &s;aid to
be guilty of Schi&s;m for his refu&s;ing to join in
Communion with this or that Particular
<PB N="42" REF="42">
Church. The Church of Chri&s;t is that whole
Body of Chri&s;tians, however di&s;pers'd all o|ver
the World, who are united to him by
Faith, and are the Members compo&s;ing and
join'd to his My&s;tical Body, profe&s;&s;ing the
&s;ame Doctrine and Faith, tho' divided into
never &s;o many &s;everal Communities, Socie|ties,
and other Parts.</P>
<P>If this be to be Schi&s;maticks, 'tis plain the
Di&s;&s;enters are not no Schi&s;maticks; and thus we
have the Te&s;timony of the Church Mini&s;ters,
we have the Vote of the Church of <HI>England</HI>
Bi&s;hops, and a Majority of the Hou&s;e of Peers,
that the Di&s;&s;enters are no Schi&s;maticks.</P>
<P><HI>What &s;hall we &s;ay now?</HI> If the Di&s;&s;enters are
allow'd by the Church not to be Schi&s;maticks;
and if the Hou&s;e of Lords concur in the Vote;
and if you will not will not quarrel with us for Habit,
Ceremonies, Liturgy or Ordination; <HI>Pray let
the&s;e Authors tell us what is the Difference among us?</HI>
The People may &s;oon be united, for here is lit|tle
left to di&s;pute of.</P>
<P>What then is it we are treated for in &s;uch
a Scandalous Manner? For what is it we are
call'd by Sir <HI>H. M.</HI> a People un&s;afe to be tru&s;t|ed
with any Part of the Admini&s;tration? In
what are we dangerous to the Government?
In what is it un&s;afe to tru&s;t us? Why, <HI>Ye are
Enemies to Monarchy,</HI> and always plotting
<PB N="43" REF="43">
again&s;t the Government, &s;ays the&s;e Learned
and Pa&s;&s;ionate Authors.</P>
<P>Say you &s;o, Sirs? We will come to an Ac|count
of Plots again&s;t Monarchy and Govern|ment
when you will; and whenever we do,
you will be found guilty of more than we.</P>
<P>But you have given us a long Li&s;t of Di&s;&s;en|ters
Plots, as you call them, and of People exe|cuted
for them. Fir&s;t of all, I believe 'twould
be hard to prove the Di&s;&s;enters were in a Plot
every time &s;ome of them were hang'd for it:
And we have &s;een &s;ome Church of <HI>England</HI>
Parliaments <HI>&V;nhang them again,</HI> as far as they
could, to do Ju&s;tice to their Po&s;terity: But I
&s;hall not ravel into the Li&s;t of Di&s;&s;enters Plots
at this time; only I cannot avoid telling this
Author that he has not given a fair Account
of them; the Di&s;&s;enters, Sir, have been guilty
of more Plots again&s;t the Government than
you charge them with, and more have been
executed for it than you tell us of; for I a&s;|&s;ure
you the Author of this wears a Mourning
Ring on his Finger, given at the Funeral of
Mr. <HI>Chri&s;topher Love,</HI> a Presbyterian Mini&s;ter,
Beheaded <HI>Anno</HI> 1653. for the horrid Phanatick
Plot, contriv'd for the bringing in, <HI>as they then
call'd him, Charles Stuart,</HI> and the re&s;toring of
Monarchy.</P>
<P>And now we come to examine a little this
Author's prepo&s;terous Motion, that we &s;hould
<PB N="44" REF="44">
give in our Grievances to the Convocation.
Why truly, Gentlemen, we have Grievances
which the Convocation might redre&s;s, but
we don't expect they will; and &s;ome of them
are as follow.</P>
<P>I. 'Tis our Grievance to be fal&s;ly accus'd,
as Mi&s;managers of the late Reign, when we
had little or nothing to do in it; as un&s;afe to
the Government, when we have all along en|deavoured
to uphold it; as Enemies to Peace,
when we challenge all our Enemies to te&s;tifie
who has the greate&s;t Zeal for the Publick
Concord, the Di&s;&s;enters, or the Church.</P>
<P>2. 'Tis our Grievance to be challeng'd to
&s;how on what Terms we can Conform, and
large Conce&s;&s;ions offer'd us in the Name of
the Convocation by Men who are &s;o far
from having any Authority from the Con|vocation,
that the Gentlemen of that A&s;&s;em|bly
do not think it worth while to own what
they &s;ay, or perform what they promi&s;e, in
their Names, as it certainly is in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>3. It is a Grievance to us, and to the whole
Nation, that we &s;hould at fir&s;t, to gratifie a
Party, and to fortifie the State Policy of Trick|ing
and De&s;igning Men, be driven out, and ca&s;t
off, from the Church-Communion, and the So|ciety
of Fellow-Chri&s;tians, for Trifles, and
Things Indifferent.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="45">
Perhaps I am not of &s;o free an Opinion
as to the Indifferency of all the Things in
which we Differ as the Church them&s;elves;
but they are allow'd by the Church them|&s;elves
to be Indifferent, and they are particu|larly
Indifferent in the Sen&s;e of Indifferency
explain'd as before; and therefore, <HI>ad hominem,</HI>
they are really Indifferent: Even the whole
of Church Di&s;cipline is &s;o far Indifferent,
that whether this or that Model be &s;ettled,
either Party are allow'd to be capable of Sal|vation
without prejudice to their Belief in
that Head; or to &s;peak plain, a Man may
go to heaven in the Practice of either of
them, but yet as Con&s;cience directs, ought
to have Liberty to Chu&s;e for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But to be ca&s;t out of Chri&s;tian Communion
for Trifles, <HI>for &s;uch are all the Indifferent Things
compar'd to the more E&s;&s;ential Points of Religion,</HI>
this is a Grievance; and this is indeed the
Original Grievance, and the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of
all their Speparation, which our Author calls
Schi&s;m, to impo&s;e what they own the Scrip|ture
does not impo&s;e.</P>
<P>'Tis my Opinion, generally &s;peaking, that
no Church can ju&s;tifie keeping out any Per|&s;on
from their Communion for any thing
that will not in its own Nature and Circum|&s;tances
keep him out of Heaven: To keep
us out of the Communion of the Church for
<PB N="46" REF="46">
things which you own we may be &s;aved with|out,
will find but &s;lender Authority in the
Scripture to Ju&s;tifie.</P>
<P>But after all, &s;uppo&s;e our Grievances
were laid before the Convocation, will this
Author a&s;&s;ure us of Relief this Way? Will
he undertake to tell us any thing the Con|vocation
has done that Way for any Body?
Nay, will he be plea&s;ed to tell us, whether
that Body, who have now Set above Fifteen
Years Annually, have done one Act or Thing
for the Benefit of the Church they Repre&s;ent?
Will he plea&s;e to give the World a Hi&s;tory of
their Actions, and engage to make out they
have done any thing but Wrangle among
them&s;elves for &s;o long time? The&s;e Men of
Uniformity, have they had any Uniform
Proceedings? <HI>Have they, in &s;hort,</HI> done any
thing worthy of them&s;elves, or the Church
they Repre&s;ent? If they have, we would be
glad to hear it; if they have not, to what
Purpo&s;e &s;hould we apply to them for the Heal|ing
our Breaches.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, let us ask him another Que|&s;tion,
Do the Convocation agree among them|&s;elves?
Have not &s;ome Gentlemen fill'd the
World with Volumes and learned Tracts on
little Matters, relating to Adjournings and Re|ce&s;&s;es
of that A&s;&s;embly; and that one Difficul|ty
&s;eems not yet Ma&s;ter'd, and how can we
<PB N="47" REF="47">
expect that Spirit of Candor, that Temper
and Peaceable Mind, which is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to bring to pa&s;s &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing as
this of a Prote&s;tant Union? How can we
look for it from an A&s;&s;embly that cannot
Decide their own Controver&s;ies, nor Heal
their own Breaches.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it &s;eems to me this Man
of Gall has over&s;hot him&s;elf, has gone be|yond
his Commi&s;&s;ion, and has made a Propo|&s;al
he had no Authority for, and promi&s;ed for
People that will not perform for him.</P>
<P>Wherefore upon the whole Matter, as we
have &s;mall Rea&s;on to hope for a Reconcilia|tion
of Principles, I think the pre&s;ent Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
of the Nation is to arrive at a Reconcilia|tion
of Parties, a Conjunction of Intere&s;ts,
a General Union of Affection, where there
cannot be a Union of Opinions; that the
Strife of Parties and Factions may cea&s;e, and
that Clamour and Contention may be at an
end.</P>
<P>Could this be brought to pa&s;s, it would
really be the greate&s;t Step towards Conjun|ction
in Religious Matters.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, This would make our Charity ex|ten&s;ive,
and we &s;hould not make it our con|&s;tant
bu&s;ine&s;s to Accu&s;e, but Excu&s;e, One
Another; Reproachful Terms and Marks of
Di&s;tinction would die of cour&s;e; Prote&s;tant
<PB N="48" REF="48">
would be the Common Name of all Opinions.</P>
<P>God be prais'd, we are all of One Religion
in <HI>England,</HI> tho' we Differ about Methods:
We pretend to be all Travelling to Heaven,
tho' we fall out by the Way; and we fall
out about the Way too: But if every man
di&s;turb'd him&s;elf le&s;s about the Cour&s;e his
Neighbour Steers, and concern'd him&s;elf more
about his own, there would more find the
right Way thither, <HI>as far as Humane Conduct
is concern'd in the Voyage to Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> they are
Mi&s;repre&s;ented to the Nation, that they are for
Tumults and Rebellions, In&s;urrections, and
pulling down Monarchy, and Governments;
enough has been &s;aid here and el&s;ewhere to
Invite the Accu&s;ers to a fair Debate; but the
pre&s;ent Ca&s;e chiefly re&s;pects their Intere&s;t.
They are not a Small, nor a Poor Sort in the
Nation: The old Proverb of, Intre&s;t won't
lye, is on their &s;ide; <HI>Men of E&s;tates are never for
pulling down Hou&s;es, Burning Towns, and Ruining
Nations;</HI> 'tis Natural for Trading Men to be
Wi&s;e for them&s;elves; 'tis Men of De&s;perate
Fortunes are for Embroiling Kingdoms, and
&s;etting States and Governments into a Flame.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> generally &s;peak|ing,
are the Men of Trade and Indu&s;try; and
what E&s;tates they have, lye principally in
Stock of Goods, Hou&s;es, and Credit. No
<PB N="49" REF="49">
Publick Di&s;a&s;ter can befal the Nation, but
what affects their E&s;tates more than other
Mens; Banks Stocks, Trade Foreign and Do|me&s;tick,
The&s;e are the fir&s;t Things that &s;uffer
on any Publick Di&s;order; and none of tho&s;e
People who are thus Embark'd in Trade, can
be properly thought to de&s;ire Di&s;a&s;ters and
Revolutions, becau&s;e they are generally the
fir&s;t that feel it.</P>
<P>There may indeed be &s;ome Men among
them that want Principles, and may Act ill,
but the&s;e are few, and not Remarkable; the ge|nerality
of the Di&s;&s;enters mu&s;t be blind to
their own Intere&s;ts, as well as Enemies to the
Government and their Neighbours, when
they promote Factions and Divi&s;ions in the
State.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve in this Ca&s;e
what I Appeal to any Man's Judgment in, be|&s;ides
my own, in the particular Article of
Stocks in the City, when the People are un|ea&s;ie
at any Publick Matters, and the Pro|&s;pect
of Affairs looks with an ill A&s;pect,
<HI>the Stocks fall;</HI> again, on the contrary, when
they are ea&s;ie, the Stocks ri&s;e, and the Stock-Jobbers
frequently Manage &s;uch Occa&s;ions;
and on this Head 'tis ob&s;erv'd, That in the Ca&s;e
of a certain Bill depending in the Hou&s;e,
when the People thought it would be pa&s;s'd,
Stocks fell; again, when the talk of it began
<PB N="50" REF="50">
to be laid a&s;ide, <HI>as it really was for &s;ome time,</HI>
all Stocks ro&s;e in Price; and when it came
to a Period, they &s;till advanc'd again.</P>
<P>Not that I Argue from hence that the
Di&s;&s;enters are the Chief Parties Intere&s;&s;ed in
the Stocks, for 'tis plain they are not; but from
hence may be &s;een by any Man who does
not put out his own Eyes, the great Benefit
of Peace and Union, the Effect it has on
Trade, Credit, and the Value of E&s;tates.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Author of this Book di&s;covers
a Spirit of too much Rancor and Malice, to
make it fit to talk with him. I am told he
is not an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man; and indeed he &s;eems
not to be an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man, by his furious way
of Treating the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation at a time when
they are all inclin'd to peace with one ano|ther;
the lea&s;t thing can be &s;aid of him in
this Ca&s;e is, that he di&s;covers Impotent Rage
at a People, who, God be prais'd, are out of
his Reach; and the Remnant of his Railing
Talent may lye either again&s;t the Lords who
have rejected the <HI>Occa&s;ional Bill,</HI> on whom, with|out
doubt, he will plentifully be&s;tow the
u&s;ual Titles of a Faction, a Party, Low-Church
Men, and the like.</P>
<P>Or el&s;e he may give him&s;elf a Loo&s;e at the
Queen, who &s;everal of his Habit, <HI>for we
under&s;tand he is a Brother of the Gown,</HI> have
left off to pray for, except at Church, where
<PB N="51" REF="51">
they cannot help it; and as Mr.&mdash;of
<HI>High-Wickham</HI> has entirely left Her Maje&s;ty
out of his Grace after Meat, ever &s;ince Her
Speech to the Hou&s;es of Parliament for Peace
and Union; &s;o the&s;e Gentlemen may be
expected with him to give Her Maje&s;ty a Ca&s;t
of their Foul Language as &s;oon as they dare
do it.</P>
<P>But one Word with this Gentleman, and
then I conclude, and that is about Plotting,
for the Di&s;&s;enters have been his Plotters and
his Rebels all along, and have on all Occa|&s;ions
been very roughly handled by him, as to
A&s;&s;ociations, Trea&s;ons, Rebellions, and the
like.</P>
<P>Now I would fain de&s;ire this Gentleman to
tell us a little News about a Plot in <HI>Scotland;</HI>
Her Maje&s;ty has given Her Parliament an Ac|count
that She has Unque&s;tion'd Informa|tion
of a Plot in <HI>Scotland;</HI> for our parts we ex|pected
it from the Malignancy of the Party
there; but now a Declaration of its Unque|&s;tion'd
reality from the Throne, has put the
Matter of Fact out of Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Now as this Gentleman keeps a very good
Corre&s;pondence there, which appears by his
own Writing, I could mo&s;t earne&s;tly recom|mend
to him to inform the World how many
Di&s;&s;enters, or Presbyterians, there are con|cerned
in it.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="52">
Without doubt he can make it appear there
are <HI>no High-Churchmen in it;</HI> for they, Good Men,
are of &s;uch untainted Principles, as to Loyal|ty,
they are &s;o true to the Doctrine of Pa&s;|&s;ive
Obedience, and Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, that 'tis
impo&s;&s;ible they can ever be concern'd in any
&s;uch thing; no, no, it mu&s;t all go upon the
poor Papi&s;ts; tho&s;e Roman Catholicks are &s;ad
Fellows; they are always plotting, and the&s;e
Whigs and Di&s;&s;enters they mu&s;t have a Hand
in it; ju&s;t as this Author &s;ays they had
in the Fire of <HI>London;</HI> the Di&s;&s;enters were in|deed
very eager to &s;et the Nation in a Flame,
when they &s;et Fire to their own Hou&s;es to
begin it.</P>
<P>But alas for us! What &s;hall we &s;ay now, if
it may be prov'd that here are a great many
High-flying Churchmen in this Plot? Then
<HI>the Wolf will be &s;tript indeed.</HI> What if here &s;hould
be <HI>Depos'd Bi&s;hops, Non-Jurant Par&s;ons,</HI> and <HI>High-Church
Epi&s;coparian Scots-men,</HI> in this Plot again&s;t
the Queen and Her Goverment? What
&s;hall we &s;ay then? Why, I'll tell you what
they will &s;ay; they'll &s;ay that Presbyterian
Tyranny has drove them to &s;uch Extremities,
that Fle&s;h and Blood could bear no longer.
To which I &s;hall an&s;wer, Not at all, granting
the Truth of Fact, that ju&s;t as much had the
Rebels at&mdash;and <HI>Bothwell-Bridge,</HI> to
&s;ay, That Epi&s;copal, Prelatick, Tyranny drove
<PB N="53" REF="53">
them to &s;uch Extremities, that Fle&s;h and
Blood could bear no longer.</P>
<P>From whence I draw this &s;hort Inference,
That whether they are Churchmen or Di&s;|&s;enters,
one Religion or another; when Men
think them&s;elves oppre&s;s'd, let their Princi|ples
and Pretence be what they will, they
will always forget tho&s;e Pretences; Nature
will prevail; they will attempt their Free|dom,
and &s;eek by Force to re&s;i&s;t Force.</P>
<P>Church of <HI>England,</HI> Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Church of <HI>France,</HI> any Church in
the World,
<Q>Whene'er they are Oppre&s;s'd, they will Rebel.</Q></P>
<P>But one thing, we mu&s;t tell the&s;e Gentle|men,
they differ from their Brother Rebels in;
that they have plotted and rebell'd with half
the Oppre&s;&s;ions and Tyranny as others have
done before them.</P>
<P>And if ever the&s;e Gentlemen plea&s;e to com|pare
the <HI>Sad and Doleful Sufferings</HI> of the Epi&s;co|pal
Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Scotland,</HI> of <HI>which they have
made &s;o much Noi&s;e,</HI> with the Mi&s;eries, Mur|thers,
Plunders, and Barbarous U&s;age of the
Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Scotland</HI> for 30 Years before, it
will be ea&s;ily &s;een which had the mo&s;t
Cau&s;e to cry out of, <HI>Fle&s;h and Blood being able to
bear no longer;</HI> and whenever they plea&s;e to en|ter
<PB N="54" REF="54">
into the Detail of the&s;e Things, we are rea|dy
to join I&s;&s;ue with them on this Head.</P>
<P>The Author or Authors of this Wolfi&s;h
Book would have done well to have taken
Advice from a Gentleman of their own Par|ty,
and who writes on the &s;ame Subject, who
has &s;aid much more to the Purpo&s;e, and in
Language much more &s;uitable to common
Civility, and good Manners; I mean the Au|thor
of a Book, Entituled, <HI>&V;nion to the Church of</HI>
England <HI>Freely Offer'd, and Earnestly Recommend|ed,
to the Di&s;&s;enters from it, of all Per&s;wa&s;ions; but
particularly to the Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>Now tho' I am of the Opinion that the
Arguments that Gentleman makes u&s;e of may
be an&s;wer'd, yet I mu&s;t acknowledge to his
Honour, that while on the one Hand he di&s;|covers
him&s;elf to be of High-Church Prin|ciples,
yet he &s;hew him&s;elf a Man of Tem|per,
a Scholar, and a Gentleman; and if ever
he is replied to, ought to be treated according|ly;
the Candor with which he treats the Par|ty
he writes again&s;t, at lea&s;t de&s;erves this
Acknowledgment, that he is the fir&s;t of that
Side that has u&s;ed them civilly, and is thereby
ju&s;t &s;o much the harder to be confuted, for
railing is much larger an&s;wer'd than Argu|ment.</P>
<P>I leave Dr. <HI>Davenant</HI> and to an&s;wer
tho&s;e Parts of the Scurrilous Invectives rela|ting
<PB N="55" REF="55">
to them, which 'tis not &s;o much a Que|&s;tion
whether they can, as whether 'tis worth
while for them, or any Body el&s;e, to reply to
&s;o much Railery.</P>
<P>Nor indeed had this been wrote, but to re|peat
to the World how willing the Di&s;&s;enters
are at all times to enter into the Merits of the
Cau&s;e, to let the World &s;ee the Rea&s;ons of
their Di&s;&s;ent, and how willing they are up|on
&s;uch Conce&s;&s;ions as Rea&s;on and Con&s;ci|ence
calls for to come to a general Union
with their Prote&s;tant Brethren, notwith|&s;tanding
all the Mi&s;repre&s;entation of High-Church
Malice to the contrary.</P>
