CONDUCT
OF THE
ALLIES, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Reception a former Work
of this Kind has met with in the
World, and the little which has
been &s;aid again&s;t it, as to Mat|ters
of Fact, mu&s;t be acknowledged to be
all owing to the Truth, coming with an
irre&s;i&s;tible Force upon the Minds of Men,
and which always carries its own Evidence
along with it; when we have met with
the Enemy de&s;canting upon it, we have
<PB N="4" REF="3">
heard them, even in the mid&s;t of a Thou|&s;and
Cur&s;es, and hard Names, which they
ca&s;t upon the Author, yet at every
Pau&s;e cry out, <HI>Damn the Circum&s;tance,</HI> I
doubt there is too much Truth in it, tho'
I hate the De&s;ign of making it Publick.
This makes it clear, which has often,
and upon many other Occa&s;ions, been
&s;aid, that our late People had a kind of
Popery in their Politicks, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that much
of their Succe&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in keeping the
People Blind and Ignorant in the Main
and mo&s;t E&s;&s;ential Points of their Affairs,
and which it was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for them
to know; that they were &s;o far from know|ing
what U&s;age they had received Abroad
from their Allies, that when they came to
be a little rightly inform'd, they could
not Frame Idea's of &s;o much Knavery in
their Heads, or think it po&s;&s;ible that any
People, who called them&s;elves Allies, could
at the &s;ame time carry them&s;elves in &s;uch a
Manner, to tho&s;e for whom they had
made the lea&s;t Profe&s;&s;ions of any Re&s;pect,
or for who&s;e common Safety they had the
lea&s;t Concern.</P>
<P>As the Truth of what has been thus &s;po|ken,
is hereby acknowledged and con|fe&s;t
by the Enemy, which is the be&s;t
kind of Evidence; &s;o the Sea&s;onablene&s;s
of making that Truth Publick in the Man|ner
it hath been by the former Tract, and
as it &s;hall or may be in this, is ju&s;tified
<PB N="5" REF="4">
and clear'd beyond all Po&s;&s;ibility of Ob|jection,
by the late Publick Re&s;olutions of
the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons, where
it comes into the World with the Sanction
and Authority of the great Repre&s;entative of
the Nation; it is true, the Particulars in
the Votes amount to a mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive
Height; and tho' it was known and be|lieved
by many to be very great, yet I
mu&s;t confe&s;s few imagined them to be &s;o
&s;urprizing, the Account &s;o large, and the
Particulars &s;o many, as they appear to
be; al&s;o one Thing is obtain'd by this Re|port
of the Hou&s;e of Commons, which
the Credit of a &s;ingle Author was by no
Means &s;ufficient for, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the <HI>Dutch</HI>
had any Share in the Deficiency, and in
the Injuries which this Nation has &s;uffered
under the Weight of this Confederacy;
many would be brought by the Power
of Rea&s;oning, and the Force of Demon|&s;trations,
which are Things all People are
not equally furni&s;hed to re&s;i&s;t; they would,
I &s;ay, be brought to confe&s;s, that there
might have been Defects in general, and
that tho&s;e Defects appeared in the Affairs of
the Empire, the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and &s;uch like,
any Thing but the <HI>Dutch</HI>; but &s;uch an
A&s;cendant had the Influence of the Poli|ticks,
and the Confederacy of the late Ad|mini&s;tration
with the Parties concern'd, ob|tain'd
over the People, that tho' any thing
would go down with them again&s;t other
<PB N="6" REF="5">
People, yet if the Dear <HI>Dutch</HI> came into
the Di&s;pute, nothing could be born with,
but all the re&s;t was the pure Effect of Ja|cobiti&s;m,
and the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>How fatal this has been to us I may
hereafter have Lei&s;ure to examine, and
every Day is like to di&s;cover more and
more of it to us; indeed Things were
mounted to &s;uch a violent Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion up|on
us in Favour of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that we began
to think even our own Con&s;titution &s;tood in
need of further Security from them,
and politickly brought the <HI>Dutch</HI> into our
National Concerns; thus making our&s;elves
beholden to them for a Guarantee,
or Safety to the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Hannover,</HI>
that this might be a Handle to our doing
other Things for them, &s;o exorbitant in
their own Nature, as that no Nation, but
&s;uch as depended upon them for &s;omething
very weighty and &s;ignificant, would
ever con&s;ent to, or could upon any
other Pretence be per&s;waded into; yet this
was not all, for when we had brought our
People to &s;toop to &s;o mean a Thought, as
that our Succe&s;&s;ion, Ratified by both King|doms,
and Incorporated by both the Par|liaments
of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the late
Solemn Treaty of Union, could receive any
Addition of Strength from Abroad, more
than that of the Intere&s;t and Alliance of &s;o
powerful a Prince, as his Electoral High|ne&s;s
of <HI>Hannover,</HI> and his Allies; that we
<PB N="7" REF="6">
&s;tood in Need of that incoherent Article
of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Guarantee; when I &s;ay we had
&s;toop'd &s;o low, as to level our Con&s;titution
to the Common Notion of Leagues and
Treaties between other and differing Nati|ons,
and that it &s;hould receive a farther
Sanction thereby, it was not hard then
to fill the Heads of the poor People with a
Belief, that whoever made the lea&s;t Obje|ction
again&s;t any Thing hereafter, which
either the <HI>Dutch</HI> might do by us, or which
we might do by them, acted therein again&s;t
the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion: This was a Point
&s;o well gain'd by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that on the
Faith of a Man, if they gain'd it for no|thing,
it was the be&s;t Bargain they made
during the whole War; and if our late
Managers granted it &s;o al&s;o, they mu&s;t
either have given up their Sences to the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> or had mo&s;t de&s;picable Thoughts of
the Strength of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and of our be|ing
able to &s;upport our own Settlement; or
which I &s;peak mo&s;t unwillingly, there mu&s;t
have been &s;ome private Bargain driven,
of which I &s;hall venture to &s;ay no more,
but that I hope no <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> could be
found that would be guilty of it.</P>
<P>To wave therefore a Reflection &s;o un|welcome,
let us go back to the Ob&s;ervation
before, <HI>viz.</HI> this Threefold End we have
&s;een it an&s;wer to the <HI>Dutch</HI>; what End it
will ever an&s;wer to us remains a My&s;tery,
and will in all Probability remain &s;o for
<PB N="8" REF="7">
many Years to come, if not for ever; the
Ends which I &s;ay it an&s;wered for the <HI>Dutch</HI>
were Three.</P>
<P>1. The Barrier Treaty, which with the
&s;eparate Article, was join'd as the Advance
Money of a Loan, by Way of what our
People call Prompt-Payment, and which
the <HI>Dutch</HI> had the Confidence to Paum up|on
us as a &s;mall Matter, and a Thing due to
them for the great Kindne&s;s done for
us by them, in taking upon them to &s;e|cure
our Succe&s;&s;ion. I am not ignorant of
that weak and fooli&s;h U&s;e which the Enemies
of Peace made of that Objection &s;poken
of in the other foremention'd Tract, p. 21.
<HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"That it may not be right in Point
of Policy, or good Sen&s;e, that a Foreign
Power &s;hould be call'd in to confirm our
Succe&s;&s;ion, by Way of Guarantee, but
only to acknoledge it; otherwi&s;e we
put it out of the Power of our own Le|gi&s;lature
to change our Succe&s;&s;ion with|out
the Con&s;ent of that Prince or State
who is Guarantee. However, our Po|&s;terity
may hereafter, by the Tyranny
and Oppre&s;&s;ion of any &s;ucceeding Prin|ces,
be reduced to the Fatal Nece&s;&s;ity of
breaking in upon the Excellent and Hap|py
Settlement now in Force."</Q></P>
<P>This by all Means they will have as an
Aim taken for the Pretender, as if, be|cau&s;e
we ought not to put it out of the
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Power of our Legi&s;lature to limit the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion,
whatever Nece&s;&s;ity may happen;
even when this Race may be all in their
Graves; that therefore we have an imme|diate
Alteration of the Succe&s;&s;ion in our
View; the&s;e People who contend thus,
forget the mighty Noi&s;e we have had from
them about <HI>Parliamentary Limitations,</HI> a
Word the Whigs have made &s;o Sacred, that
it has been like the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of their
Liberties, and with which they run down
the Hereditary Right of their Princes, as if
there had been nothing at all in it but Ty|ranny,
and Arbitrary Government, till at
Length it was happily di&s;covered, that
they were very well con&s;i&s;tent together;
and that they who be&s;t under&s;tood He|reditary
Right, had proved it to be agree|able
to Parliamentary Limitation, and then
all was well again. But after all this Bu|&s;tle,
was it to be imagined that the &s;ame
People could &s;o ea&s;ily give up the Parlia|ments
Right of limiting the Succe&s;&s;ion to
a Foreign Nation; and by making a League
of Guarantee for the Succe&s;&s;ion, legitimate
the Impertinence of Strangers, who may
hereafter intermeddle with our Con&s;titution,
and may tell a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, they have
no Power to alter or meddle with the Set|tlement
of the Crown, for that it is already
Settled, and they are Guarantees of it?
What has been, may be; and what may be,
may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be; if then any of
<PB N="10" REF="9">
the Family of <HI>Hannover</HI> &s;hould Tyrannize or
Abdicate, or the &s;ame, or like Circum&s;tances
&s;hould happen, as have happened before,
the Parliament would be di&s;abled from
declaring the Throne vacant, and filling
up the &s;ame with &s;uch other of the Family
as they find convenient; which according
to all the Whig Principles which we have &s;o
often heard of, is in&s;eparable from the
Con&s;titution, and much more Sacred than
any Thing which has been Hereditary in
the World. I do not encline to concern
the&s;e Papers with the popular Di&s;putes
which have troubled the World &s;o much
and &s;o long, about the Difference between
Hereditary and Parliamentary Right; how
far they are the &s;ame, or which is be&s;t fur|ni&s;hed
with Authorities, and Originals,
whether of Divine or Civil Right; it is
enough to take hold here of the Whigs
own Argument, and allowing all they have
&s;aid on this Head to be Orthodox, whether
it really be &s;o or no; it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
follow, that this Parliamentary Right can|not,
or ought not, to be given out of our
Hinds, and put, by a Treaty, into the Hands
of Foreigners; &s;o that it &s;hall be in their
Power to put their Negative into our next
Limitation of the Crown. If this be not
to give away our Liberties, I would be glad
to know what it is to keep them; if there
be any Choice of Tyrants, and if it weighs
any Thing, when our Priviledges are given
<PB N="11" REF="10">
up, who is it they &s;hould be given up to?
I confe&s;s my&s;elf more willing to be a Slave
at Home than Abroad, and to be tyran|niz'd
on by a Prince of our own, than by a
Foreign Nation; and if there were no other
Rea&s;on for that than this, it would be &s;uf|ficient
to ju&s;tifie the Choice, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
there are more Ways to avoid the Mi&s;chief
of it, that an oppre&s;&s;ing Prince has &s;ome
times chang'd his Mea&s;ures, or he may be
re&s;train'd, or may die, and thereby a Nation
may be delivered; but &s;uch a Convention
as this, made with a Foreign Nation, en|gages
that whole Nation upon all Occa&s;ions
to embark it&s;elf, and its whole Strength, in
Defence of the Capitulation agreed on; and
thus by this Method the Power of Parlia|ment
in future Limitations of the Crown
&s;eems to be effectually given up: How the
Whigs would have liked this Doctrine if it
had come from any one but them&s;elves, may
be be&s;t gue&s;s'd at by the Warmth they
&s;hewed about the League &s;aid to be made
by the late King <HI>James</HI> and the King of
<HI>France</HI>; which put this whole Nation into a
Flame, and Rea&s;on good &s;o far as that
League appear'd; for what was it, or what
could we imagine it to be, but a Treaty
of Guarantee with the <HI>French</HI> for the &s;ecu|ring
the Succe&s;&s;ion of Popery in <HI>England?</HI>
Whereas the Settling the Religion and Li|berties
of this Nation was the undoubted
Right of the People in Parliament, and &s;o
<PB N="12" REF="11">
by the &s;ame Rule mu&s;t the Succe&s;&s;ion of
our Princes be. The Sum of all this is,
that by the Whigs own Arguments, and by
their own Principles, which they have al|ways
profe&s;&s;ed, and adher'd to, and by
the &s;ame Rule from which they acted in
the Revolution, the accepting a Guarantee,
for the &s;ecuring the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown
of this Kingdom to any Family, or Branch
of a Family, Race, or Line what&s;oever, is
no le&s;s than giving up the Privileges of
the People, and dive&s;ting the Parliament
of the Power of limiting the Succe&s;&s;ion to
the Crown.</P>
<P>It may be remember'd, that in the late
Treaty of Union with <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;ome Se|cret
Overtures were made, to have engaged
the <HI>Dutch</HI> to be Guarantees of that Treaty;
and though that Propo&s;al &s;eem'd to come
from &s;uch Hands, as gave Rea&s;on to be|lieve
it was rather a De&s;ign to de&s;troy,
than &s;ecure the &s;aid Treaty, the <HI>Dutch</HI>
having at that Time di&s;cover'd Willingne&s;s
enough to have prevented the Conclu&s;ion
of that Treaty, yet tho&s;e that knew any
Thing of the Re&s;entment expre&s;&s;ed at that
Time here again&s;t that Propo&s;al, as di&s;|honourable
to <HI>England,</HI> and de&s;tructive of
the Con&s;titution of both Kingdoms, would
wonder that ever the &s;ame Mini&s;try &s;hould
&s;o far change their Notions, as to admit
the &s;ame Guarantee in &s;o Nice an Affair, as
the Succe&s;&s;ion to their own Crown, which
<PB N="13" REF="12">
they rejected with Contempt in a Treaty
with the Neighbouring Nation.</P>
<P>Secondly, Another End an&s;wered by this
Treaty of Guarantee, was giving an Oppor|tunity
to the <HI>Dutch</HI> to play their own Game
with us, with Re&s;pect to other Treaties, Quo|ta's,
Proportions of Payments, Ships, Troops,
and the like; of this &s;o much has been &s;aid
already, and is yet like to be &s;aid farther in
Publick, that I &s;hall need &s;ay the le&s;s to it
here, my De&s;ign being rather to ju&s;tifie the
Re&s;entment all hone&s;t Men entertain, at the
mean Politicks and Submi&s;&s;ions of our Peo|ple
here, and to &s;how the Nece&s;&s;ity of ta|king
wi&s;er for the future, than to Animate
People again&s;t any of our Confederates.
I am as forward as any to agree, that the
Advantages of a &s;trict Union among the
Confederates are very great; and that,
as Her Maje&s;ty expre&s;t it, the Intere&s;t of
the States of <HI>Holland</HI> be looked upon as our
own; but this by no means hinders us from
de&s;iring that the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hould u&s;e us well,
&s;hould &s;hew a Reciprocal Kindne&s;s, and
&s;hould act with a mutual Concern for the
General Confederated Intere&s;t; and that
we &s;hould not be willing to &s;ee them im|po&s;e
upon us in any of tho&s;e Particulars,
or be ea&s;ie, and &s;ubmit quietly to it when
they do; and this is &s;o much Ju&s;tice, that
none can object again&s;t; and what is the
be&s;t, if not the only Way, to cultivate and
maintain that Friend&s;hip, and good Un|der&s;tanding,
<PB N="14" REF="13">
on both Sides, which is &s;o
much the Intere&s;t of the Confederacy in
General, and of the <HI>Dutch</HI> them&s;elves in
Particular. They who contend, that the
enquiring into the&s;e Things &s;eems to &s;how
a Di&s;regard to the Confederacy in General,
or to the &s;everal Parties concerned in Par|ticular,
&s;eem to make &s;everer Satyrs upon
the <HI>Dutch</HI> than they are aware of. The
Deficiencies of the Performance they can|not
deny, the want of a due Regard then
to the Confederacy mu&s;t certainly lye rather
in tho&s;e that have been the Cau&s;e of tho&s;e
Deficiencies, than tho&s;e that have not; for
who are mo&s;t ju&s;tly to be charged with
&s;lighting and di&s;regarding the mutual In|tere&s;t
of the Con&s;ederacy, they that have
failed in the Performance of the Conditi|tions,
or they that complain of it, in or|der
to have them performed? <HI>Britain</HI> has
all along &s;hown, by a Zeal Fatal to her&s;elf,
her Willingne&s;s to pu&s;h on the War with
all imaginable Vigour; in order to which,
when Her deficient Allies, having le&s;s Con|cern
for the general Good, have run the
Venture of Mi&s;carriage, to &s;horten their
Expence; <HI>Britain,</HI> as if the whole Charge
of the War had been her Due to pay, has
zealou&s;ly &s;upply'd both their Quota's, and
her own: While &s;he was willing to do thus,
her Confederates daily encreas'd their De|ficiencies,
and her Expence, as they might
very well do, finding her &s;o ea&s;ie; and
<PB N="15" REF="14">
while &s;he was willing to &s;it &s;till, and &s;ee
her&s;elf, thus u&s;ed, it was very remarkable
how Augmentations, and Increa&s;e of For|ces,
was every Year propo&s;ed by the Con|federates,
as well in <HI>Flanders,</HI> as in <HI>Spain,</HI>
and none &s;o forward as the Emperor him|&s;elf
to increa&s;e the Quota's of the Troops,
and the Charges of the War, upon the
re&s;t of his Confederates; quietly waiting
for their &s;upplying Additional Troops, and
taking Care to have very few of his
own.</P>
<P>While we &s;ubmitted to all the&s;e Things,
the War went quietly on, but whether
&s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, or no, as it might have
done, if the Allies had an&s;wered what we
had Rea&s;on to expect from them, is left
for them to An&s;wer. At la&s;t, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Court entering into a more narrow In&s;pe|ction
of Things, have not thought fit &s;o
calmly to &s;uffer the Weight of the War to
lye heavier upon one Shoulder than ano|ther;
and tho' equally willing to bear their
Share of the Burthen, yet not forward
to carry that Load, which ought to lye up|on
other Shoulders. They are now calling
upon their Confederates, to con&s;ider a little
the Ju&s;tice of their &s;everal Treaties, and to
look back, and &s;ee what they are obliged
to do, if they expect the War &s;hould be
carried on any farther; if they are diffident
of the Succe&s;s of the&s;e Remon&s;trances from
their Experience, how fruitle&s;s the like
<PB N="16" REF="15">
have been before, and have therefore at
the &s;ame Time embrac'd the Occa&s;ion that
has offer'd, towards putting an End to the
War, by an Honourable Peace; they will
be ju&s;tified in it before all the World, both
now, and for ever; when it &s;hall be at the
&s;ame Time under&s;tood, in what Man|ner,
and for how many Years, this War
has been carried on; nor can the Artifices
of an Adver&s;e Party among us delude ma|ny
in their &s;ugge&s;ting to the World, that
the Government here is in the Intere&s;t of
<HI>France,</HI> &s;ince they can have no other Rea&s;on
to back that Sugge&s;tion, than that they were
not willing to carry on a War upon unequal
Terms, and in a Confederacy with Allies,
who would not perform their own Con|ditions,
and in which tho&s;e, who expected
the greate&s;t Advantages from it, paid the
lea&s;t Part of the Expence towards it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the Third End which this ge|neral
Complaint again&s;t a Peace has been
Calculated to An&s;wer, and which the Party
has taken Care to make as popular as they
can, is a general Notion, that tho&s;e who
are for a Peace, do it with a De&s;ign, by
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>France,</HI> to introduce the
Pretender; however weak and incon&s;i&s;tent
&s;uch a Con&s;equence may be, nothing is
more certain, than that many innocent, and
well-meaning People, have been prevailed
upon to believe it; and tho' the Impro|bilities
of the Thing in its own Nature,
<PB N="17" REF="16">
and the &s;teady Zeal of the Per&s;ons who they
charge with it, and who have all along, in
a Cour&s;e of many Years, te&s;tified their Ab|horrence
of that Intere&s;t, and taken &s;uch
Steps again&s;t it, as have been mo&s;t effectual
to the cutting off all Hope, both from him
and his Party, might &s;uffice to any rea&s;onable
People; yet this &s;eems to be one of tho&s;e
Difficulties which can be &s;olved only by
a little Patience and Time: To tho&s;e who
will be convinced by Argument, it &s;eems
&s;ufficient, that our putting a &s;top to a War,
which we carried on at &s;o much Di&s;advan|tage,
and which had in View rather an
utter Empoveri&s;hing the Nation, than a
timely Reducing our Enemies to Rea&s;on,
however, was not only nece&s;&s;ary on many
other Accounts, but greatly our Advantage
on this Account, in e&s;pecial Manner; that
thereby we might be left in a Condition to
defend our Con&s;titution, and to pre&s;erve
Power to maintain our Succe&s;&s;ion, as our
Parliament had thought fit to limit it, with|out
the Help of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and without
being put to &s;o weak, &s;o &s;candalous, and
&s;o di&s;honourable a Shift, as to accept of
the Guarantee of Foreign States, to pre|&s;eve
our own Acts of Parliament.</P>
<P>When I look farther into this &s;candalous
Thing, called a Guarantee for our Succe&s;|&s;ion,
methinks it repre&s;ents to me our
People on their Knees to the <HI>Dutch</HI> for the
Mighty Favour of taking us into their High
<PB N="18" REF="17">
and Mighty Protection; and indeed, when
this is compared with the Manner with
which the States of <HI>Holland</HI> carried on the
<HI>Geentruydenbergh</HI> Treay, wherein the ma|king
a Peace for us was al&s;o left wholly to,
or engro&s;&s;ed by, the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> the
Thing &s;eems very much of a Peice. The
Barrier Treaty al&s;o has much of the &s;ame
Manner in it, which being handled at large
by it&s;elf, I &s;ay no more to here. I have
ob&s;erved, that at the Time when we be|gan
to talk here of Peace, and when the
<HI>French</HI> Articles began to appear, we were
mightily amu&s;ed with the <HI>Dutch</HI> making
Offers, that they would take away the Ex|cu&s;e
from us of want of Money, or Cre|dit,
and the <HI>Dutch</HI> would advance to us
Four Millions Sterling, to encourage us to
carry on the War. That the <HI>Dutch</HI> made
&s;uch an Offer Publickly in Form is known
to be a Mi&s;take; but that the <HI>Dutch</HI> might
be willing to lend, or to give as much as
that amounts to, to have the Sole Direction
of making the Peace, that &s;o their particu|lar
Intere&s;t, which they never forget, might
be principally provided for, this there can
be no great Que&s;tion of; and the <HI>Dutch</HI>
are not without Cunning enough to make
it &s;o well worth their while, as that &s;uch
a Sum of Money &s;hould not be ill laid out.
But tho&s;e People &s;hould do well to con&s;i|der
Two or Three Things which lye hid
in this Notion, of the <HI>Dutch</HI> lending us &s;o
<PB N="19" REF="18">
much Money, and which by Way of Co|rollary,
may be of great U&s;e to us, in the
under&s;tanding of other Parts of Manage|ment
on that Side. (1.) That if the States
of <HI>Holland</HI> for the carrying on the War,
could &s;pare us &s;o much Money to encou|rage
us that we might not make a Peace
without them, tho' that has not yet been
thought of, them however, all they thought
fit to &s;ay in former Times, of their being
impoveri&s;hed, and exhau&s;ted, and not in
a Condition to pay their Quota's, mu&s;t be
a manife&s;t Fraud and Cheat, and mu&s;t be
with De&s;ign to put upon us the Nece&s;&s;ity
of carrying it on upon unequal Conditions;
and this they could not have entertained a
Thought of, without fir&s;t being &s;en&s;ible
that they had us at &s;o much Advantage, as
that they knew, whenever they thought fit
to ea&s;e their own Charge, they might-put
the Hard&s;hip upon us. (2.) Since it
was obtained by the Arts of their other
Conduct, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had the Sole Di|rection
of the Peace, it followed then, that
we were under an Obligation to carry on
the War at their bidding; from whence it
was mo&s;t natural to believe, they were not
dark-&s;ighted enough not to make their other
Advantages. (3.) The&s;e Things make it
no longer a My&s;tery, why the <HI>Dutch</HI> would
advance any Sum of Money for the en|couraging
us to carry on the War, becau&s;e
it followed, that we &s;hould carry it on
<PB N="20" REF="19">
under the &s;ame Inequalities and Di&s;advan|tages
which we did before; but now the&s;e
Things are detected, and if we &s;hould come
to a Nece&s;&s;ity of carrying on the War,
which God forbid, yet that it &s;hould be more
than probable we may not only demand
that they begin upon a new Foot, and
make up all their Quota's for the Time to
come, but al&s;o may call upon them for what
is pa&s;t; al&s;o it is more than probable, that
they may then plead Poverty with us, as they
did before, and talk no more of the great
Sums they would lend us. (4.) There is yet
another Remark to be made upon this Head,
<HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Dutch</HI> advancing &s;uch great
Sums of Money to us; we have never found
but the&s;e Sums were to be all lent upon
good Parliamentary Security and on the In|tere&s;t
current in <HI>England</HI>; and we might not
be thought ungrateful to the Lenders, if
we asked them, where was the Advantage
of all that? Was it to us, or to them&s;elves?
They mu&s;t not know the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;o well as
we have Rea&s;on to know them, who ex|pect
to find them ever forgetful of their
own Intere&s;t in any Propo&s;al they may
make. It is true, we have complained of
our being impoveri&s;l&s;ed and exhau&s;ted, and
not in a Condition to carry on the War, e&s;pe|cially
at the rate which it hath been carried
on at, without great Inconveniencies, and
Involving, Mortgaging, and Anticipating
for us, and our Po&s;terity, at a Rate, which
<PB N="21" REF="20">
neither are like to &s;ee the End of; but what
is our Defect? We do not want Lenders, but
Funds to borrow upon; we have U&s;urers
enough among us to devour us, we want
no Help from the <HI>Dutch</HI>; we are not with|out
a Sort of Men among us, who having
little or no Intere&s;t in the Freehold, have
ama&s;&s;ed infinite Sums of Money in Ca&s;h,
with which they Trade upon the re&s;t, and
live upon the Blood and Vitals of the Go|vernment;
the&s;e, like the Eagles where the
Carka&s;s falls, gather together; and if the
Parliament can but find Funds, tho' they
boa&s;t of having the Power of Credit in
them&s;elves, and often think of making
them&s;elves Formidable, by threatning the
Government that they will lend no Money,
and that they can ruin the Publick Credit,
by refu&s;ing to advance their Money, yet
they can no more forbear, than a Vulture
can forbear his Prey; the Funds are the
Carka&s;s they feed on; they are as Hungry
for them, as a Lion that has been Hunting,
and found no Food; and in &s;pight of their
Faith, often Pledg'd to their Party and
Friends, to run down Credit, and lend no
Money, let but the Mini&s;try find a Fund,
and the Parliament e&s;tabli&s;h a Lottery, or
Sub&s;cription, or Loan, and they are ready
to trample one another to Death to get in
their Money. So that after all that hath
been &s;aid of the <HI>Dutch</HI> lending us Money,
we &s;ee nothing to be &s;aid to it, but what
<PB N="22" REF="21">
was &s;aid in An&s;wer to &s;ome Bantering Lines
in the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. made upon
the King, which his Maje&s;ty by Repartee
an&s;wered him&s;elf thus.<Q><L>" <HI>Charles</HI> at this Time having no Need,</L>
<L>" Thanks you as much as if he did.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is apparent in our Ca&s;e we want no
Lenders; we have been devoured with
Harpies already, who think, as no doubt
the <HI>Dutch</HI> would al&s;o think, and perhaps
&s;ay too, that <HI>the Borrower is Servant to the
Lender.</HI> But we mu&s;t acknowledge we
want <HI>Funds</HI> to borrow, and where to find
them, &s;uch excepted as will plunge us yet
farther and farther into a Gulph, whence no
le&s;s than a Hundred Years can redeem us,
is pa&s;t the Skill of the be&s;t Advocates for a
War to find out; indeed I cannot but won|der,
that in all the Noi&s;e the Faction have
made at the&s;e Things, they have not de|&s;cended
to one Argument again&s;t the Diffi|culty
of rai&s;ing Funds; they have indeed
told us Great Things, <HI>a la Ga&s;conade,</HI> that
there are Funds enough, that <HI>England</HI> is
va&s;tly rich, that there is Money enough,
that we can with Ea&s;e carry on the War
this Seven Years, and &s;uch Rhodomontade,
that they have Surfeited the People with it
for &s;ome Time; but we do not &s;ee one of
them that offers any Scheme how, and up|on
what de&s;tructive ruinous Fund, this
<PB N="23" REF="22">
Money may be rai&s;ed, that the People
may judge whether what is alledged be
true, yea, or no; and whether tho&s;e Funds
they &s;hall &s;o propo&s;e, &s;hall not be as fatal
to the general Good, as tho&s;e that have
gone before; with &s;uch fallacious Ways have
the People been managed, till they have
led them on to the brink of inevitable Ruin;
and now, as if it were not enough, that
the Nation hath for &s;o many Years been
oppre&s;&s;ed by the War, through the Negli|gence
or Knavery of our Con&s;ederates,
we are mode&s;tly de&s;ired to proceed in the
War upon the &s;ame Foot. I confe&s;s, this
among our own People is a Sign of &s;ome
National Stupidity and Blindne&s;s, which
one would hardly think po&s;&s;ible; but for
our Neighbours, whether the States Gene|ral,
or others, to de&s;ire in, &s;eems to &s;mell
of &s;omething we want a Word for in our
Tongue, and may be better expre&s;s'd in
<HI>French</HI> by <HI>Marveillieux Surprenant,</HI> and the
like. I mu&s;t needs &s;ay I have not yet met
with any Man &s;o weak, but what begins
to feel the Force of this Argument enter in|to
his Soul, if the Allies have not perform'd
according to their Agreement, they &s;hould
be reminded of it; and if we cannot pre|vail
with them to make up former Defects,
we ought at lea&s;t to be careful that they
comply punctually for the Time to come.
Can any People be &s;o be&s;otted to a Party,
as to expect or de&s;ire that a Nation, already
<PB N="24" REF="23">
impoveri&s;hed by the unfair Impo&s;itions of
Her Allies, and not able to carry on the
War on the Terms &s;he hath done for &s;ome
Time, &s;hould not in&s;i&s;t upon more Ju&s;tice
for the future, that &s;he may be able to hold
it out?</P>
<P>Neither is this an unnece&s;&s;ary Argument
at this Time, for if we can carry on this War
at the Expence of Three Millions and Half
Yearly, in&s;tead of Seven, then we are bet|ter
able to go on Two Years upon the Square
with our Allies, than One Year upon the
unequal Foundation we have gone upon all
along; &s;o that to bring our Allies to do us
Ju&s;tice, and to exert them&s;elves to the utter|mo&s;t, in carrying on the War, is the true&s;t
and be&s;t Step towards the main Point, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
of carrying it on, if we are a&s;&s;ured we &s;hall
no more be impo&s;ed upon; if we &s;ee the
full Quota's of Troops in the Field, the full
Numbers of Ships in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and
all Things in Readine&s;s in Time, and fit for
Action; if any Thing will revive the droop|ing
Spirits of the Nation it mu&s;t be this;
it mu&s;t be that they have &s;ome Hopes of not
being cheated again, and that the powerful
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Allies will be a Means of
putting a happy and &s;peedy End to the
War, that a &s;afe Peace may follow; and
it is ea&s;ie to find that nothing but this wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
do it; nothing el&s;e can per&s;wade an ex|hau&s;ted
Nation to bleed anew, but &s;ome
A&s;&s;urance that they &s;hall not be &s;uffered by
<PB N="25" REF="24">
their Allies to bleed to Death, that there
&s;hall be &s;ome End of their Sorrows and
Mi&s;eries, and that every Hand is fairly
engaged in bringing Things to a happy
End.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Things &s;eem to call for no further
Remark from us, they are &s;o natural and
plain in them&s;elves, that every Child in the&s;e
Affairs may under&s;tand them; for if we mu&s;t
carry on the War; it mu&s;t be needful that we
&s;uffer our&s;elves to be no more abu&s;ed by our
Allies; if we are not to expect Ju&s;tice from our
Allies, then we mu&s;t be unaccountably be&s;ot|ted
if we carry on the War; nay, tho' a
wor&s;e Peace were to follow than Her Ma|je&s;ty
hath good Rea&s;on to expect from the
Negotiations now on Foot.</P>
<P>But it may not be ami&s;s to enquire here
what Pro&s;pect there appears of the&s;e Things,
and what Hopes our Allies do put us in, of
expecting for the future better Treatment;
and that in the Pur&s;uit of the War they
will go on upon a different Foot from that
which they have hitherto gone upon; for if
there was but &s;ome Appearance of an A|mendment
for the future, it might be &s;ome
Encouragement to us to think of pro&s;ecuting
the en&s;uing Campaigns with more Comfort;
but in&s;tead of this, all we yet &s;ee amounts to
little that Way, for at Home all the Fruit
of the Di&s;covery &s;hows only a kind of Re|gret
that it is made publick, an inward
fretting that the Fact is too obvious, &s;o that
<PB N="26" REF="25">
they cannot contradict it, and an envious
Warmth at the Ju&s;tice done their own
Countrey in it, becau&s;e it touches upon the
States-General, as if to touch them were
fatal to us all; and perhaps it may indeed be
fatal to &s;ome Projects the Party had &s;er on
Foot here, de&s;tructive enough to the Liber|ty
of their Country, and of which a little
Time may give us a farther View: This is
clear, in that all the Reply we have here to
the detecting the hard U&s;age we have met
with from our Allies, i&s;&s;ues in Exclamations
at our expo&s;ing the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and falling upon
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> &s;preading Reports that we de|&s;ign
to fall out with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and that
we are for a Peace with <HI>France,</HI> and a
VVar with the <HI>Dutch</HI>; as if we mu&s;t refrain
a due In&s;pection into our own Affairs, for
fear of the Effects it will or may have upon
the <HI>Hollanders</HI>; it is no le&s;s the Duty of
every. Faithful Repre&s;entative to enquire
how other Nations may impo&s;e upon the
People, and wa&s;te and de&s;troy us, than it is
how we are embezzelled at Home, for every
Breach of Treaty is in this kind a Depredation
upon the People; and it is mo&s;t rea&s;onable,
that when they have thus di&s;covered the
Fraud, and by who, as well as by what
Means, the Nation is exhau&s;ted and worn
out, they &s;hould &s;o far expo&s;e the Matters of
Fact, and the Per&s;ons, that the People may
know by what Means they are impoveri&s;hed;
this hath been the con&s;tant Method and
<PB N="27" REF="26">
U&s;age of Parliaments, and the Members of
Parliament could not have di&s;charged the
Tru&s;t they have committed to them by
the People they Repre&s;ent, it they had
omitted it. Nor can this be called expo&s;ing
the <HI>Dutch</HI>; they lay open the Truth, if that
expo&s;es the <HI>Dutch,</HI> or any other Per&s;ons or
States, the Misfortune is their own to be
liable to &s;uch a Charge; but let &s;uch People
an&s;wer what they would have had the
Hou&s;e of Commons have done, when upon
Enquiry into the State of the War, they
found that we had not been fairly u&s;ed by
the Confederates; if they had held their
Peace, had they not been Criminally Silent?
Had they not betrayed their Countrey? Had
they not been Acce&s;&s;ary to all the Frauds of
the like Kind which &s;hould have happen'd
for the Future? And what would the Lan|guage
of Po&s;terity have been, when they
&s;hould have &s;een that the Hou&s;e of Com|mons
knew the&s;e Things, but took no No|tice
of them, or any Care to have the Nati|on
informed of them? Mu&s;t it not have been
a ju&s;t Reproach upon them, as it is now up|on
tho&s;e who knew it before, and yet took
no. Notice of it, or made any Application to
former Parliaments to have it redre&s;&s;ed? But
it is evident the&s;e People, who make now
&s;uch loud Complaints of the Reflections ca&s;t
upon our Allies, appear more concerned that
the Matter is made Publick, than that it is
true; and are &s;o far from de&s;iring any Cure
<PB N="28" REF="27">
for the Di&s;ea&s;e, that they &s;pend all their
Heat and Re&s;entment at the Di&s;coveries of
it; and it is to be ob&s;erved from their Con|duct,
that they make Ten Reflections upon
the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the Pre&s;ent
Mini&s;try, for the Indu&s;try and Pains taken
in finding out how, and by whom, the
Nation has been abu&s;ed, for One ju&s;t Remark
upon the Integrity and Zeal in the War of
tho&s;e Allies, who have u&s;ed us in &s;uch a
Manner: Whence &s;uch a Spirit can proceed,
and what Rea&s;on can be given for it, is not
&s;o hard to find out, as it is melancholy to
reflect, that &s;o it &s;hould be.</P>
<P>I might go forward in this Ob&s;ervation
to expo&s;e the Foundation from whence all
this proceeds, and by which we &s;hould &s;oon
&s;ee for what U&s;es and Purpo&s;es &s;ome People
are &s;o de&s;irous of pu&s;hing on the War; and
how to do it they care not, upon what
Di&s;advantages, and unequal Conditions,
they did it; being willing to bear any
part of the Burthen, nay, all the Burthen,
&s;o the beloved War were but to be pur&s;ued;
the Enquiry into this will open many Scenes
of private Treachery, not yet brought to
Light, and for that I purpo&s;e to do it in a
Tract by it&s;elf; I &s;hall leave it to a fit Oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>It
falls next in View to Interrogate the
Mini&s;ters at <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> how they proceed, and
&s;ee thereby what Mea&s;ures the <HI>Dutch</HI> take
to convince us, that we &s;hall have a better,
<PB N="29" REF="28">
and more equal, Ballance kept up among
us, in ca&s;e the War is to be continued.
But here you &s;hall find Mea&s;ures calculated
rather to compel the Queen of <HI>Great-Bri|tain</HI>
to carry on the War, than to invite
Her Maje&s;ty to it by A&s;&s;urances of perform|ing
Treaties better than in the Times pa&s;t.
This is a Temper &s;o different from what
might be expected from a People, who had
&s;o treated their Allies, to us who complain
of being &s;o treated, that it is as before,
<HI>Marvellieux</HI>; or to put it plainer, a kind of
throwing off the Mask; as if we were obli|ged
to &s;ubmit to be cheated, after we had
fir&s;t di&s;covered that it was &s;o; and that what
before was done covertly, and under
the Appearance of a Treaty, was now to
be done more effectually, openly, avowed|ly,
and in the Teeth of the re&s;t of the
Allies.</P>
<P>This appeared upon the fir&s;t Conference
after the <HI>French</HI> Plenipotentiaries had deli|vered
in their Paper of Explanation, as they
called it, on the Propo&s;als of the Peace,
which they had formerly given in. It came
then to the Turn of the Allies to con&s;ider
in what manner to deliver in their An&s;wer
to the <HI>French</HI> Propo&s;als; this it was re&s;olved
&s;hould be by the Confederate Mini&s;ters de|livering
in their Demands, or the &s;everal
Preten&s;ions of their re&s;pective Principles,
without taking any Notice of the Project
contain'd in the Paper given in by the Mini|&s;ters
<PB N="30" REF="29">
of <HI>France</HI>; it &s;hould have been noted
here in the fir&s;t Place, that after all the
<HI>Dutch</HI> had &s;aid, and after all that had been
&s;aid to them, in order to come to this Trea|ty,
prepared to pre&s;erve a good Under|&s;tanding
among the Allies, and to bring
the Treaty to the de&s;ired Conclu&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI>
a good Peace: The <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ters ap|peared
there without any Character, having
neither Powers as Plenipotentiaries, or as
Amba&s;&s;adors, or any Thing more than
meer Commi&s;&s;ioners, Empowered only
to hear what was &s;aid, make Report
to their Ma&s;ters the States, and give back
their An&s;wers, which one of the Queen's
common Me&s;&s;engers may as well do on our
Side. Nor were the Per&s;ons, the Equipa|ges,
or the Sallaries allowed to their &s;aid
Commi&s;&s;ioners, any more than what was
&s;uitable to common Me&s;&s;engers, who&s;e Bu|&s;ine&s;s
it was to carry a Me&s;&s;age, and return
with an An&s;wer; &s;o that in the Conferences,
either General or Particular, there was no
debating Things with them, only ju&s;t giv|ing
in what any one had to &s;ay, and all the
An&s;wer the&s;e Men could give, was that
they would Report it to their High-Migh|tine&s;&s;es
the States General, and would bring
their An&s;wer. The <HI>French</HI> Plenipotentia|ries
pre&s;ently objected again&s;t the&s;e Powers,
as not &s;ufficient to admit the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini|&s;ters
into the Conferences. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ple|nipotentiaries,
tho' they were &s;en&s;ible of the
<PB N="31" REF="30">
Affront offered in it to their Royal Mi&s;tre&s;s,
after &s;uch A&s;&s;urances on Her Maje&s;ties Part,
of Her &s;incere Intention to make the Intere&s;t
of all Her Allies to be as Her own, yet wil|ling
to wave every Thing that might give
an Ob&s;truction to the happy I&s;&s;ue of the
Peace, did not in&s;i&s;t on this; though they
could not but complain that it greatly ob|&s;tructed
that happy Concert of Mea&s;ures,
which they hoped might have been the
con&s;tant Fruit of the private Conferences of
the Confederate Mini&s;ters, which the <HI>Dutch</HI>
having no Powers that extended any farther
than barely to Hear, and Report, and bring
back a Re&s;olution; was for want of tho&s;e
Powers quite di&s;appointed; &s;o that the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ters might as ju&s;tly be deemed
and termed Porters, as Plenipotentiaries.
Well, notwith&s;tanding all this, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Plenipotentiaries, willing to promote the
great End for which they a&s;&s;embled, which,
as the Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> expre&s;t it,
was in the Name of God, to bring the Wars
to a happy Conclu&s;ion, in an Equitable and
Honourable Peace, all the&s;e Ob&s;tructions
were pa&s;t over on their Side, and they la|bour'd
to have the Powers of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mi|ni&s;ters
accepted, as at la&s;t they were, with
&s;ome Difficulty; and thus they proceed to
the Affair of the Demands, as above, which
were to be delivered in as the 5th of <HI>March.</HI>
The <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ters concealing the Re&s;olu|tion
taken at the <HI>Hague,</HI> to give in no De|mands,
<PB N="32" REF="31">
but the very immediate Copy of
the Preliminaries la&s;t treated on, in&s;i&s;ted that
all the Confederates Demands &s;hould be
formed into one In&s;trument, and be given
in jointly by all the Plenipotentiaries, as the
general Demands of the whole Alliance.
This, tho' &s;omething &s;urprizing in it&s;elf, yet
was the le&s;s &s;o, when it was more known
that this was, in order to execute the Mea|&s;ures
above noted, (<HI>viz.</HI>) of bringing in the
Preliminaries of <HI>Geertruydenbergh,</HI> as the
Summary Demands of the Allies. But the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plenipotentiaries taking Notice of it,
in&s;i&s;ted, that this &s;eem'd to be de&s;tructive
of the Treaty it&s;elf, that <HI>France</HI> had Twice
ventured to carry on the War, rather than
agree to tho&s;e Preliminaries. That they had
been declared Impracticable, and could not
be treated on here; and to in&s;i&s;t on the very
literal Form of tho&s;e Preliminiaries now, and
pre&s;cribe the Plenipotentiaries to treat on
them, was to declare again&s;t a Treaty at
all. That this Meeting was under&s;tood by
all Parties, to be not a Treaty of Prelimina|ries
in order to a Treaty of Peace, but a Ge|neral
Treaty of Peace it&s;elf, wherein the
Specifick Demands of every Ally were to
be heard, debated, and finally di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, ad|ju&s;ted,
and an&s;wered, to their Satisfaction,
which could by no Means be done by Preli|minary
Articles, which had in them &s;everal
References to a farther Treaty, and &s;ome
&s;ugge&s;ted Demands left to be farther di&s;cu&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="33" REF="32">
at another Time; whereas they were
now met to make a final and general Con|clu&s;ion
of all Demands and Preten&s;ions what|&s;oever,
that there might be no more Blood
&s;hed in the Chri&s;tian World, that an
End might be put to the Mi&s;eries of <HI>Europe</HI>;
it was al&s;o alledged, that the &s;aid Prelimina|ries
had not been concerted with a due Re|gard
to the Intere&s;t of all the Allies; in
e&s;pecial Manner it was asked, what Article
there was to be found in them which re|garded
the Intere&s;t of Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje|je&s;ty,
farther than what meerly re&s;pected
Her Title to the Crown, and the Bani&s;h|ment
of the Pretender; whereas there &s;eemed
a great deal of Rea&s;on for admitting farther
Demands for the Security, and enlarging the
Commerce and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Her Maje&s;ty,
and Her Subjects; for this Rea&s;on, as
well as in Behalf of the re&s;t of the Confede|rates,
the &s;aid <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plenipotentiaries in|&s;i&s;ted
upon giving in the In&s;trument of their
Demands in particular, every Ally by them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>It
mu&s;t be &s;omething a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;uch
true Lovers of their Countrey, who can look
back on the&s;e Things with unprejudiced
Judgements, to reflect on the Temper reign|ing
in this Part of <HI>Europe</HI> at the Time of
the Treaty afore&s;aid, when in all the nume|rous
Articles adju&s;ted at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and af|terwards
debated again at <HI>Geertruydenberg</HI> by
<PB N="34" REF="33">
the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> the former left out
nothing which concerned their own Intere&s;t,
Security or Advantage; nay, engaged the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI>
Court to concern and engage them&s;elves
for their particular Security and Advantages,
but not one Word. Clau&s;e, Article, or Debate,
was ever thought of for the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> either as
to the Security of their Commerce, as it then
&s;tood, or the Encrea&s;e of it for the future.
On the other Hand, all the Stre&s;s on the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Side, and for which we were to
think our&s;elves infinitely obliged to the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> was to engage their A&s;&s;i&s;tance to
keep out the Pretender, and &s;ecure the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
of the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to his
Electoral Highne&s;s of <HI>Hannover</HI>; a Thing
which is &s;o the Univer&s;al Re&s;olution of all
the People and Parties in <HI>Britain,</HI> and to
which they think all the Oppo&s;ition that can
be made from either <HI>French,</HI> or any el&s;e, is
&s;o trifling and in&s;ignificant, that they cannot
be &s;en&s;ible of the exceeding Obligation on
that Behalf to their Confederates, or of the
great Danger which they were in of
the Pretender, although no Foreign A&s;&s;i|&s;tance
had been engaged on that Behalf,
e&s;teeming the Favourers of the Preten|der
in <HI>Britain,</HI> not with&s;tanding their great
Clamours of a Party among us, to be
&s;o &s;ew, and &s;o incon&s;iderable, as that there
is nothing to be &s;eared from them; but &s;up|po&s;ing
there had been more Danger of this
<PB N="35" REF="34">
Clau&s;e, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Succe&s;&s;ion, then we are
willing to hope there is Ground to appre|hend
it cannot but be reminded, that it
is as much the Intere&s;t of the States-General
to &s;ecure that Succe&s;&s;ion in the Illu&s;trious
Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover,</HI> as it is even of <HI>Great|Britain</HI>
it&s;elf, and much more than it can
be &s;uppo&s;ed to be to <HI>Britain</HI> to &s;ecure to
them the Barrier of <HI>Flanders</HI>; for &s;hould the
Dominions of her <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty ever
fall into the Hands of a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Inte|re&s;t,
or into the Hands of a Prince, who is or
may be in the Intere&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> the Ter|ritories
of the States-General being &s;tript of
the Powerful A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Troops
by Land, and Fleets by Sea, mu&s;t inevita|bly
be expo&s;ed to the Powerful Inva&s;ion of
<HI>French</HI> and <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fleets united, and their
Trade in particular eaten up and de&s;troyed,
as was verified by woful Experience to the
&s;aid States in the Year 1672, when, if the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court had not broken off from the
&s;aid <HI>French</HI> Alliance, the States-General had
inevitably &s;unk under the Power of <HI>France,</HI>
and their Government been di&s;&s;olved and
de&s;troyed; &s;o that upon the whole it is ma|nife&s;t
there was no need on our Part to
engage the <HI>Dutch</HI> to appear for the Security
of our Succe&s;&s;ion to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover</HI>;
for that the Sovereign Law of their own
Pre&s;ervation will always put them under a
Nece&s;&s;ity of doing it, the contrary being
mo&s;t &s;ure to be a great Step in their Injury,
<PB N="36" REF="35">
if not their evident De&s;truction: It may be
argued, that in Rules of Government we
are not to depend upon this or that State
being obliged by their own Intere&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t
us, but we are to regard what Nece&s;&s;ity,
either for Security of Trade, common Safe|ty
of Government, or other Political Inte|tere&s;t,
we are in, or may be in, of the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of the Powers we are treating
with, and if that Nece&s;&s;ity appears it is a
&s;ufficient Rea&s;on for us to &s;ecure that A&s;&s;i|&s;tance;
and this we have frequent Exam|ples
of, as of the <HI>Dutch</HI> them&s;elves treating
with us in 1676, when notwith&s;tanding it
was the undoubted Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> not
to let <HI>Holland</HI> upon any Terms whatever fall
into the Hands of <HI>France</HI>; and if ever the
<HI>French</HI> do again make that Attempt, we
ought to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> with all our Troops
and Power; and that not &s;o much from any
Care and Kindne&s;s to them as a Nation, but
for our own Intere&s;t and Pre&s;ervation; yet
the <HI>Dutch</HI> knowing the Eyes of a Nation are
not always open to their own Intere&s;t,
thought fit to tie us to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in that
Ca&s;e, and even Articled with us for the
Proportion, <HI>viz.</HI> the Number of Ten Thou|&s;and
Men. This is brought for a Rea&s;on
why, not with&s;tanding its being &s;o much the
Intere&s;t of the States of <HI>Holland</HI> to pre&s;erve
the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover</HI> to
the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> we ought al&s;o
to bind them to it by Treaty: But tho' we
<PB N="37" REF="36">
were to grant all this, it will not follow that
this Treaty &s;hould have &s;uch a Price put
upon it, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hould demand of
us all they want for this little Equivalent;
and the Rea&s;ons above, tho' they &s;hould
not be allowed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t again&s;t the Treaty
of Guarantee it&s;elf, will certainly take off
much of that High Price which the <HI>Dutch</HI>
have put upon it, as if we were under &s;uch
Infinite Obligations to them to &s;ecure it for
us, as that we were quite out of Condition
to defend it our&s;elves, or as if they had
no Concern, or were to receive no Security,
Benefit, or Advantage, at all by it to them|&s;elves:
Again, it might pa&s;s for &s;ome Ar|gument
in this Ca&s;e, that if any Power in
<HI>Europe</HI> ought to have &s;ought this Guarantee
from the States-General, it &s;hould have been
the Elector him&s;elf, who on his Part might
probably have &s;ome more Occa&s;ion to &s;e|cure
his Pa&s;&s;age over to <HI>England,</HI> and the
March of any Troops which his Highne&s;s
might find nece&s;&s;ary to bring with him, to
a&s;&s;i&s;t his Faithful People of <HI>Britain</HI> to place
him on the Throne, in Ca&s;e a <HI>French</HI> or
<HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t &s;hould make Oppo&s;ition.
Here indeed the States-General might be
very u&s;eful Allies, and his Electoral High|ne&s;s
would have thought very well of &s;uch
a Guarantee of the States; but it cannot be
conceived that <HI>Britain</HI> can be under like
Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a Security: The Succe&s;&s;ion,
which is their own Act and Deed, being uni|ver&s;ally
<PB N="38" REF="37">
approved by the whole Nation, a
few People excepted, who are contemptible
either for their Number or Intere&s;t; &s;o
that on all the&s;e Accounts it &s;eems however
a Treaty of Guarantee may be u&s;eful enough
for our Succe&s;&s;ion, and no Harm in it; yet
it cannot be a Thing of that Weight as to
have &s;o great a Value &s;et upon it, and that
<HI>Britain</HI> &s;hould &s;uffer her&s;elf &s;o much to be
impos'd upon for it, as it is apparent to all
the World &s;he has been on that Account.</P>
<P>We return now to the Manner of the
carrying on of the Treaty of Peace at <HI>&V;trecht:</HI>
The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plenipotentiaries having, as I
&s;aid above, in&s;i&s;ted upon the giving in the
Demands of the Allies in a &s;eparate Manner,
have by this Means an Occa&s;ion of &s;ecu|ring
for the Subjects of Her Maje&s;ty &s;ome
other Advantages than by the former Trea|ty
was thought of; and the People of <HI>Bri|tain</HI>
may now &s;ee, not only on what Di&s;ad|vantage
for us the former Treaty was nego|tiated,
when we were to have our Markets
made for us by our <HI>Dutch</HI> Neighbours; but
they may &s;ee that all the Noi&s;e that hath
been made of the Pre&s;ent Mini&s;try; and of
the pre&s;ent Managers being in the Intere&s;t
of <HI>France,</HI> amounts only to this, That
whereas the other gave up all our Intere&s;t to
the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the Emperor, the&s;e Men are
careful that <HI>Britain</HI> may reap &s;ome Advan|tages
by the Treaty as well as the re&s;t of the
Confederates.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38">
Indeed it has been &s;omething wonderful
in the common Di&s;cour&s;e of the People on
the&s;e Subjects to find the Generality poi&s;on|ed
by the&s;e &s;elf-denying Notions, <HI>viz.</HI> that
all which can be obtained from <HI>France</HI> mu&s;t
be given to the Emperor, and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and
the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> but nothing to the
Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; as if our Strength
were no Acqui&s;ition, or our Power any Safe|ty,
to the Alliance; nay, rather, as if it were
dangerous to the Confederacy to entru&s;t any
Part of that we have fought &s;o long for, and
bought &s;o dear, to the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain:</HI>
One would think the <HI>Dutch</HI> them&s;elves
went on that Notion, when, as was apparent,
they appeared unea&s;ie and jealous at the
Preparations made by Her Maje&s;ty to &s;end a
Fleet and Forces to <HI>Canada</HI>; while not know|ing
the De&s;ign, they apprehended it to be for
the taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome Place or other
in the <HI>Spani&s;h America,</HI> altho' by the <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">th
Article of the Grand Alliance it was agreed
that Her Maje&s;ty might lawfully have done
&s;o if &s;he had thought fit. The&s;e Things,
however of no other Con&s;equence, yet
&s;erve to let us &s;ee how different, as re&s;pecting
us, the Manner of the Allies hath been in all
the Tran&s;actions of this War, and how
different their Views have been in all their
Steps towards a Peace, from our con&s;tant
Behaviour in the &s;ame Heads as they re&s;pe|cted
them; and that in all the&s;e Occa&s;ions
it has been the con&s;tant Maxim of our Con|federates,
<PB N="40" REF="39">
that we were to have no Share
in any Thing, but that the <HI>Dutch,</HI> under a
Notion of a Barrier and Security to their
Frontiers, &s;hould make large Acqui&s;itions, both
to their Territory and their Commerce, both
which have been con&s;ented to from hence;
whether it be to the Honour or to the Infa|my
of tho&s;e who have given in to the&s;e
Mea&s;ures is left to the Impartial Part of Man|kind
to determine: It is evident that at
length the Ju&s;t Repre&s;entations of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI>
Mini&s;ters took Place, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> after
much Difficulty have yeilded that the De|mands
of the Allies be given in to the <HI>French,</HI>
altho' in one and the &s;ame In&s;trument, yet
in &s;eparate Heads; and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plenipo|tentiaries
agree and propo&s;e to add at the
End of every Head this General <HI>and Satisfa|ction
of all the re&s;t of the Allies,</HI> a Clau&s;e &s;uf|ficient
to remove the Scandal and Reproach
early ca&s;t upon the Pre&s;ent Management,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) That they de&s;igned to make a Separate
Peace, and had actually concluded the Con|ditions
there of with <HI>France</HI> before the Congre&s;s
was to begin; I mu&s;t crave Pardon if I make
the&s;e &s;everal In&s;tances of the U&s;age of Her
Maje&s;ty hath met with from Her Allies,
Rank in with their other Conduct relating
to Forces and Quota's, which have already
been made Publick, and all together to come
under the Title of Deficiencies; for if
there had been a more di&s;intere&s;ted Con|junction
of Coun&s;el and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mea|&s;ures
<PB N="41" REF="40">
in the Proceedings of the Allies, to
and with Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty, and Her
Mini&s;ters, no Que&s;tion this Treaty had
been with more Ea&s;e brought on, with
more Mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance to, and Confidence
in one another entred into, and perhaps
the Succe&s;s might have been more promi|&s;ing
al&s;o.</P>
<P>There &s;eems to be no Occa&s;ion here of
Entring into the Clau&s;es which the <HI>Dutch</HI>
have obtain'd in any of their Treaties and
Agreements with us, by which they have
gain'd Advantages in Commerce, particu|larly
to our Prejudice, becau&s;e even the
<HI>Dutch</HI> them&s;elves acknowledge them in
their late Letter to Her Maje&s;ty; only de|claring.
That they do not de&s;ign to take
the Advantage of tho&s;e Articles. I am ve|ry
willing to believe the States-General, e&s;|pecially
while a good Under&s;tanding among
the Allies, and particularly between Them
and Us, is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to them, would not
make U&s;e of the Advantages which were
given them by that Treaty; but this does
by no Means deny, nay, it not Tacitly on|ly,
but even Explicitly, as it &s;eems to Indif|ferent
Judgments, grants that &s;uch Advan|tages
are given to the <HI>Dutch</HI> by that Trea|ty.
See the Declaration of the <HI>Dutch</HI> on
this Head more particularly, as follows.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'For having learnt that the Principal Ex|ceptions
taken to the &s;aid Treaty were,
that it might prove Prejudicial to the
<PB N="42" REF="41">
Commerce of Her Maje&s;ty's Subjects in
the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands</HI>; and that &s;ome
had entertain'd an ill-grounded and erro|neous
Opinion, that the States might de|&s;ign
to take Advantage by it to make
them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the &s;aid <HI>Spani&s;h Ne|therlands,</HI>
their High Mightine&s;&s;es did
declare po&s;tively, and by this Letter do
voluntarily repeat it, that it never was
their Intention, nor ever will be, to make
u&s;e of the &s;aid Treaty, or of their Garri|&s;ons
in the Fortified Places of the Country,
to prejudice in any Manner the Com|merce
of Her Maje&s;ty's Subjects; but
that their Opinion is, That whatever re|lates
to Navigation and Commerce there,
ought to be &s;ettled on an intire Equality,
that &s;o Her Maje&s;ty's Subjects may not be
charged with higher Duties of Importa|tion
or Exportation than theirs, to the
end Commerce may be carried on there
by both Nations on an equal Foot.'</Q></P>
<P>Here the States-General acknowledge,
That whatever relates to Navigation and
Commerce in the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands</HI>
ought to be &s;ettled on an entire Equality:
This is owning what Her Maje&s;ty has &s;ince
claimed to be Ju&s;t, and yet that it has not
been &s;o is apparent al&s;o; and in the &s;ame
Letter they acknowledge it again, by ad|ding.
<Q REND="inline">'That if there be &s;ome Articles of
the &s;aid Treaty which without affecting

them willing and ready to treat there|upon,
with all the Facility and Con|de&s;cen&s;ion

<P>Now however Satisfactory &s;uch an Offer

&s;uppos'd to be Ignorant of the Ju&s;tice of Her

how willing &s;oever in other Ca&s;es to oblige
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> he had not &s;o little Concern for

call a Treaty &s;o Di&s;honourable and

no doubt whatever other Rea&s;ons his

another Hand and other Management ef|fected

Only this cannot in Ju&s;tice to the Pre&s;ent
Mini&s;try and Parliament be omitted, <HI>viz.</HI>
That if this Enquiry into the&s;e Things had
not been begun, tho&s;e Explanations had ne|ver

left in a Capacity when they thought fit
to exclude the Subjects of <HI>Britain</HI> from all

<P>There &s;eems indeed one Clau&s;e in the

the Words are the&s;e, <Q REND="inline">'That however,
having not long &s;ince been inform'd, that

Railery; who when they have chew|ed
it, and mumbled it, like an A&s;s upon Thi|&s;tles,
will bring it out the &s;ame thorny crab|bed
Incon&s;i&s;tency that they found it.</P>
<P>But while we are leaving them to this
difficult Work, it may be needful to look
farther, for we have yet much more Work
cut out from <HI>Holland</HI> than in the foregoing
Piece; the States-General having receiv'd
a new Bru&s;h from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament,
are very &s;olicitous to wa&s;h their Negro
Skin as clean as they can from the Impu|tations
which have lain &s;o plainly again&s;t
them; but now they find it more difficult
than they did before; for till now they had
only Pamphlets and general Clamours to
an&s;wer, &s;uch as the Su&s;picions of the Peo|ple,
and the Information of a Few had
made loud; and which began to make them
unea&s;y, the&s;e were treated with &s;ome Con|tempt
by the States, and more by their
Friends here.</P>
<P>But the Parliament finding more Truth
in the&s;e Things than perhaps they expected,
and much more than the Faction pretend|ed,
thought it requir'd an Extraordinary
Sanction to make them le&s;s di&s;puted, and
thought it Ju&s;t to make them Publick with an
undi&s;puted authority, that the People ought
to be undeceiv'd, and that the Quarrels a|bout
the Truth of Fact ought to cea&s;e among
the People; for this Rea&s;on, having cau|&s;ed
<PB N="49" REF="50">
all the Particulars to be exactly and
faithfully laid before them, by the Report
of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty,
and other proper Officers, and tho&s;e Parti|culars
to be critically examin'd, they dedu|ced
from thence the Matters of Fact as they
really were, and making all the Ca&s;es plain
in which the Government had been impos'd
upon by their Allies, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Defici|ent
among others; they came to &s;everal
Re&s;olves about the &s;ame, and drawing tho&s;e
Re&s;olves up into General Heads, referring
to the Particulars for their Demon&s;tration,
they Humbly repre&s;ented all in an Addre&s;s
to Her Maje&s;ty, and cau&s;ed both the &s;aid
Re&s;olves and the Addre&s;s to be Printed, for
the Conviction of all Her Maje&s;ty's good
Subjects, and to confute and &s;ilence a Par|ty,
who, as above&s;aid, had made it their
Bu&s;ine&s;s to ridicule all that had been &s;aid of
the&s;e Matters as fal&s;e and empty Notions
infu&s;ed into Peoples Heads, to rai&s;e ill
Blood and create Prejudices again&s;t the
<HI>Dutch.</HI> If the&s;e Things coming forth with
&s;uch an undi&s;puted Authority did a little
&s;urprize the World, and con&s;equently open
the Eyes of the People, much more would
they &s;urpri&s;e the States-General, who&s;e In|tere&s;t
it had &s;o long been to have the Peo|ple
of <HI>Britain</HI> kept as ignorant as po&s;&s;ible of
the&s;e Matters; and finding it ab&s;olutely Ne|ce&s;&s;ary
that &s;omething &s;hould be &s;aid to
puzzle the Cau&s;e a little, and to furni&s;h
<PB N="50" REF="51">
their Friends with Arguments for their De|fence,

charged by the Re&s;olutions or Votes of

divers Re&s;pects during the pre&s;ent War, in
furni&s;hing what according to their Quota or
Contingent they &s;tood engaged for, towards
carrying on the &s;aid War.</Q></P>
<P>This is the Paper which I come now to
examine, and in which if I &s;hould di&s;cover
that the States-General have really been &s;o
far from clearing them&s;elves of the Charge
&s;o po&s;itively laid upon them in Parliament,
that in every Part they either directly or ta|citly
acknowledge it, then there will re|main
little Force in the re&s;t of their Paper.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering this New and Great Af|fair
of the <HI>Dutch Memorial,</HI> it &s;eems ve|ry
proper to make as few Circumlocutions
as po&s;&s;ible, and come directly to the Point.
Our Introduction therefore &s;hall con&s;i&s;t ra|ther
of laying down a Li&s;t of the Particu|lars
which we &s;hall leave out, than of what
we &s;hall put into the following Tract; what
<PB N="51" REF="52">
&s;hall be dropp'd as foreign to the Ca&s;e in
Hand, and not worth either the Author's
while to Note, or the Readers to be con|cern'd
about. As Fir&s;t, It &s;hall take up lit|tle
of our Time to animadvert on the In&s;o|lence
Unparallell'd, of a Scandalous Merce|nary,
who in Defiance of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parlia|ment,
and while that Parliament was actu|ally
&s;itting, &s;hould have the Face to pub|li&s;h
the An&s;wer or Defence of a Foreign
Nation again&s;t his own Country.</P>
<P>If a Man have receiv'd an Affront from
another, and meets one of his Servants,
and &s;ays to him, you <HI>Jack,</HI> or you <HI>Thomas,</HI>
pray tell your Ma&s;ter I &s;ay he is a Villain
and a Ra&s;cal; will not the Servant if he
have any Manners or Sen&s;e of his Duty &s;ay
to him, <HI>Sir,</HI> let him be what he will, he is
my Ma&s;ter, and it is not fit for me to tell
him &s;o, pray employ Somebody el&s;e? On
the other Hand, if the Ignorant. Fellow
&s;hould have &s;o little Wit or Manners as to
carry this Me&s;&s;age to his Ma&s;ter, would not
the Ma&s;ter &s;ay to him, let the Man be what
he will, you are an Unmannerly Ra&s;cal for
bringing me &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age, &s;ince you
were my Servant, and not his? And would
he not very ju&s;tly cane him, and turn him
out of his Service for his Impudence.</P>
<P>This Ca&s;e, as it is unprecedented, unle&s;s
in the &s;ame Per&s;on who did the like once
before, &s;o it will be doubly unprecedented
in the Publick Ju&s;tice, if he is uncorrected
<PB N="52" REF="53">
for it. Nay, by how much more the Par|ty
glory in and boa&s;t of having in&s;ulted
the Parliament and the Government in this
Publication, by &s;o much the more Nece&s;&s;i|ty
they bring upon the &s;aid Parliament to
vindicate them&s;elves, and puni&s;h the Per|&s;ons
with their utmo&s;t Rigour: But this is
Humbly left and &s;ubmitted to the Parlia|ment,
who no doubt will do them&s;elves
and their Defender Ju&s;tice in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Next it &s;hall take up no Part of this Di&s;|cour&s;e
to enquire whether the <HI>Dutch</HI> have
ordered the&s;e Sheets to be thus publi&s;hed in
<HI>England,</HI> or no. We are not ignorant how
many Ways of Late the Foreign Powers
concern'd in this War have privately en|deavour'd
to make them&s;elves and their
Actings with Her Maje&s;ty Popular here,
appealing at it were from Her Maje&s;ty to
her Subjects; but we &s;hall not &s;uppo&s;e
however that they are yet arrived to &s;uch
a Contempt of their Alliances with Her
<HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty, as to appear in an Acti|on
which derogates &s;o much from the u&s;ual
Civilities due from one Ally to another, as
that they &s;hould openly and avowedly
make an Attempt of this Nature.</P>
<P>This Leads us to con&s;ider how prudent|ly
the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> has acted in
this Ca&s;e, in which perhaps the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as
&s;ubtle a Nation as they are, and how good
&s;oever their Politicks have been in other
Ca&s;es, will be put to it, how to behave
<PB N="53" REF="54">
them&s;elves between the Two Extreams of
Owning or Di&s;owning this Publication of
their <HI>Memorial.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament have fir&s;t &s;tigmatiz'd
the Paper it&s;elf as a <HI>Fal&s;e and Scandalous Li|bel,</HI>
but in this Cen&s;ure they do not call it
the <HI>Memorial of the States-General,</HI> but a
<HI>Pretended Memorial:</HI> Now as the Lie is
here given by the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation,
and that mo&s;t ju&s;tly al&s;o, it remains for the
<HI>Dutch</HI> to &s;how us how they plea&s;e to take
it; if they own the Paper and the Publica|tion
of it here, they take the Lie afore&s;aid
to them&s;elves, and are obliged to fall under
the Charge, hu&s;h it up, and thereby own
in Ju&s;t, or re&s;ent it, which we &s;uppo&s;e they
will con&s;ider of, before they go about it.
On the other Side, if they take upon them
to mention, an&s;wer, or vindicate this Pa|per,
they own not the Paper only, but the
mean Step of Cau&s;ing it to be publi&s;hed in
<HI>England</HI> in e&s;pecial In&s;ult to Her Maje&s;ty,
and to the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> then &s;itting,
and what evil Con&s;equences may follow
&s;uch a Thing mu&s;t lye at their Doors. It
is true, that as the Parliament has not
thought fit to take it but as a &s;purious and
pretended Paper, we might very well do
&s;o al&s;o; but as we &s;ee it publi&s;hed in all
Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> as allow'd in tho&s;e Prints
in <HI>Holland,</HI> who are &s;aid to write <HI>cum Privi|legio</HI>;
and as it is in the&s;e Countries &s;tiled,
<HI>The An&s;wer of the States,</HI> &amp;c. we cannot
<PB N="54" REF="55">
but treat it as &s;uch, or at lea&s;t as an An&s;wer
<HI>for</HI> the States, if not, <HI>The An&s;wer <HI>of</HI> the
States.</HI> And that this may be ju&s;tified by
good Evidence, the Reader may ob&s;erve,
that our Prints after the Re&s;entment of
the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> had made it too
dangerous for our New&s;men to go on
with the Printing it, gave this Account, <HI>A|pril</HI>
4th.<Q>Hague April 17. All our Publick Prints,
<HI>Publi&s;hed by Authority,</HI> have been
and continue full of the States Reply to
the Re&s;olutions of the Commons of <HI>Bri|tain,</HI>
in Vindication of their Conduct.</Q></P>
<P>This we cannot but think gives &s;ufficient
Authority to a Writer, whether the States-General
are concern'd in the Publication at
<HI>London</HI> or no, to &s;uppo&s;e them to be the
real Authors of the Paper it&s;elf, and that
it is really the <HI>States Reply,</HI> as above,
and as &s;uch we &s;hall therefore con&s;ider it.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t Thing meet for Ob&s;ervation in
it, is what we ought not by any Means to
pa&s;s over, <HI>viz.</HI> That the States-General
confe&s;s the Charge, acknowledging the Fact,
directly, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Quota's for Sea Ser|vice
were not &s;upply'd, or as the Re&s;oluti|on
of the Hou&s;e of Commons expre&s;s it,
viz. <HI>That the States-General have been de&s;ici|ent
in their Quota's for Sea Service in Propor|tion</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="56">
<HI>to the Numbers of Ships provided by Her
Maje&s;ty,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>To this the States in their <HI>Memorial,</HI> after
a very long Introduction, an&s;wer Two
Things; Fir&s;t, That the Quota the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Court propo&s;ed to fit out, particularly in
the Years 1704 and 1705, were too many,
or more than was needful for the Service;
<HI>viz.</HI> More than was needed to make the
Confederates Superior to the <HI>French</HI> in the
<HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and that therefore they the
States did not think them&s;elves obliged to
furni&s;h &s;o many. That whereas we &s;hould
have Seventy-four Ships the Year 1704,
and Seventy-nine the Year 1705, they
thought the Rate of Twenty-four Ships of
their State a Proportion again&s;t Sixty of
Her Maje&s;ty's, and that they concerted it
&s;o with Admiral <HI>Mitchel.</HI> So that it is plain
here from this very <HI>Memorial,</HI> that the
States do no Manner of Way deny the Defi|ciency
it&s;elf, but evade the Force of the
Charge by Di&s;puting the Proportions; and
explaining what they under&s;tood by the
Two Fifths to Three Fifths, &s;o in&s;i&s;ted on
by the Parliament, and how they ought
to be under&s;tood by others. Again, they
would patch up the Deficiency afore&s;aid,
by bringing in the Number of their Men
of War employ'd in the North Seas to
make up their Quota, and they expre&s;s this
very Subtilly, as a Thing which they think
ought to be &s;et again&s;t the Number of Ships
<PB N="56" REF="57">
employ'd by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> in the Narrow
Seas; this may be con&s;ider'd immediately
in their own Terms; but Fir&s;t, it is fit to
Note, that both the&s;e Arguments confe&s;s
the Charge in Fact, only offer the&s;e Expla|nations
or Extenuations: So that the Truth
of what the Parliament has publi&s;h'd in
their Repre&s;entation and Addre&s;s &s;tand fa&s;t,
is acknowledg'd and confe&s;s'd by the States,
and needs no farther Defence. But it comes
next of Cour&s;e to &s;ee what Force this Alle|gation
of the <HI>Dutch</HI> as to their Ships in the
North Seas ought to have in this Argument;
and if it appears that the&s;e are not, and
ought not to be reckon'd in the Proportion
above, and that they were not reckon'd in
the Fir&s;t Proportion &s;tated and agreed with
the States-General, then all the Con&s;equen|ces
drawn from tho&s;e Proportions will &s;tand
the States in no Stead, as to any Defence to
be made by them again&s;t the Charge. In
the Examination of this, we meet with this
Clau&s;e in the State of Proportions laid before
the Hou&s;e; by the Lords of the Admiralty,
which &s;tands Diametrically Oppo&s;ite to
what the States alledge in their <HI>Memorial,</HI>
in the&s;e Words, <HI>viz. That by the Treaties
between the Queen of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>and the
States-General, their Proportion of the Ships of
the Line of Battle, to act in Conjunction with
tho&s;e of this Kingdom in the</HI> Channel, <HI>and in
and about the</HI> Mediterranean, <HI>ought to be Three
to our Five.</HI> The Fir&s;t Ob&s;ervation meet to
<PB N="57" REF="58">
be made here, is, that the Treaties be|tween
the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the
States, have expre&s;ly &s;ettled their Re&s;pe|ctive
Proportions, which indeed the <HI>Memo|rial</HI>
&s;eems to evade, by alledging, that in
the Grand Alliance the Re&s;pective Parties
were to a&s;&s;i&s;t with <HI>all their Forces</HI>; then
Complimenting <HI>Britain</HI> (I do not &s;ay Flat|tering)
with being more Powerful than the
States, they thence deduce the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s
of the Forces of one being more than
the other. But the States-General would
think them&s;elves but ill an&s;wer'd if this
Way of Argument was made u&s;e of with
them, for what is all this to the Equality of
Proportions? Have not the <HI>Dutch</HI> always, as
the <HI>Memorial</HI> acknowledges, treated every
Year with the Queen upon the ju&s;t Propor|tions
of every Year's Service? And has not
the Queen &s;ent Admiral <HI>Mitchel</HI> always to
&s;ettle that Point? Now the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion
is not whether Nation is mo&s;t Powerful, or
whether we are to &s;end more Troops than
the States-General, or more Ships; but
whether the Proportions being &s;ettled An|nually
by Agreement, the States-General
have &s;upply'd the Numbers agreed on by
tho&s;e Treaties, and &s;ent as many as they a|greed
to &s;end or no; if they have done this,
then it is true, the Fir&s;t &s;ettled Proportions
are of no Weight. On the other Hand, if
they have not the General Treaty of Em|polying
<PB N="58" REF="59">
all their Forces, or any other are
Equally of no Force.</P>
<P>Now it is apparent that the States-Gene|ral
have not &s;upply'd their Quota of Ships
for the Services for which they agreed to &s;up|ply
them, and therefore we on our Side ju&s;tly
Complain, and the Account as it was laid
before the Hou&s;e by the Lords Commi&s;&s;io|ners
of the Admiralty, and by Her Maje&s;ty
Command, is very plain in the Ca&s;e,
admitting of no Di&s;pute; wherefore we
have for a further and more effectual Con|vincing
the Advocates for the States-Gene|ral
in this Ca&s;e, cau&s;ed it to be annexed at
large, and is as follows.<Q>By the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for Executing
the Office of Lord High Admiral of
<HI>Great-Britain, Ireland,</HI> &amp;c. of all Her
Maje&s;ty's Plantatious.</Q></P>
<P>HER Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure having been
&s;ignify'd to Us by Mr Secretary <HI>St. John,</HI>
that we &s;hould in Pur&s;uance of an
Addre&s;s from the Hou&s;e of Commons) pre|pare
an Account of the Quota's of Her Ma|je&s;ty's
Ships and tho&s;e of Her Allies during
this pre&s;ent War, and what Agreements and
Conventions have been made for the &s;aid
Quota's, and how the &s;ame have been ob|&s;ervd,
We do in Obedience to Her Maje&s;ty
Command Humbly Report.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60">
That by the Treaties between the Queen
of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the States-General,
their Proportion of the Line of Battel to act
in Conjunction with tho&s;e of this Kingdom
in the <HI>Channel</HI> and in and about the <HI>Mediter|ranean,</HI>
ought to be Three to our Five.</P>
<P>That &s;ince the Commencement of this
War, not only Sir <HI>David Mitchel</HI> but Sir
<HI>James Wi&s;hart</HI> have been appointed by Her
Maje&s;ty's Command to go to <HI>Holland,</HI> and
adju&s;t with the States-General or their De|puties,
the Quota's of their Ships of War
to act in Conjunction with tho&s;e of Her
Maje&s;ty's, as afore&s;aid, and what was done
in Pur&s;uance of tho&s;e Treaties was &s;ent to
Her Maje&s;ty's Principal Secretary of State,
to which we Humbly refer.</P>
<P>And as to the Number of Ships in the
Line of Battle which the States-General
each Year during the War have join<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d
to Her Maje&s;ty's on the foremention'd Ser|vices,
the &s;ame will appear by the following
Account, which hath been computed with
as much Exactne&s;s as the Nature of the
Things will bear, <HI>viz.</HI> In the Year 1702,
Her Maje&s;ty had Forty four Ships employ'd
in the <HI>Channel</HI> and <HI>Soundings</HI> of the Line of
Battel, and Thirty in and about the <HI>Medi|terranean,</HI>
making in the whole Seventy-four,
and they were join'd with no more
than Thirty-three of the States-General,
whereas they &s;hould have been Forty-four.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61">
1703, Seventy-nine of Her Maje&s;ty's
Ships were employ'd in the afore&s;aid Ser|vices,
and but Twenty-two of the States-General,
which &s;hould have been Forty|&s;even.</P>
<P>1704, There was Seventy-four of the
Queen's Ships and Eighteen <HI>Dutch,</HI> which
&s;hould have been Forty-four.</P>
<P>1705, Seventy-nine of Her Maje&s;ty's
Ships and Twenty-eight <HI>Dutch,</HI> which
&s;hould have been Forty-&s;even.</P>
<P>1706, There were but Fifteen Ships of
the <HI>Dutch</HI> acted in Conjunction with Seven|ty-eight
of the Queen's Ships, whereas they
&s;hould have been Forty-&s;ix.</P>
<P>1707, To Seventy-two of Her Maje&s;ty's,
they were no more than Twenty-&s;even of
the States-General, in&s;tead of Forty-three.</P>
<P>1708, The States-General join'd Twenty|five
Ships of the Line to Sixty-nine of Her
Maje&s;ty's, in&s;tead of Forty-two.</P>
<P>1709, No more than Eleven Ships of the
States were join'd to Sixty-&s;even of the
Queen's, in&s;tead of Forty-three.</P>
<P>1710, Her Maje&s;ty had Sixty-two em|ploy'd
in the afore&s;aid Service, and the
States-General appointed no more than
Thirteen to act in Conjunction with them,
in&s;tead of Thirty-&s;even.</P>
<P>1711, There was no more than Twelve
<HI>Dutch</HI> Ships in&s;tead of Thirty-five appoint|ed
to act with Fifty-nine of the Queen's
Ships, which as well as tho&s;e in the Pre|ceeding
<PB N="61" REF="62">
Year were employ'd in the <HI>Mediter|ranean,</HI>
and not &s;o much as one allotted by
the States-General to act in Concert with
tho&s;e of Her Maje&s;ty again&s;t the Enemies
Ships at <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and in the <HI>Channel.</HI></P>
<P>Here &s;eemeth a mo&s;t convincing Proof of
the Matter of Fact. Now let us &s;ee what
<HI>Dutch</HI> Cunning will bring them off of this,
for it is a home Charge, and they will not
ea&s;ily parry the Thru&s;t. The <HI>Memorial</HI> in
Truth does not attempt it, and therefore
the Matter of Fact as I &s;aid before &s;tands
granted. But they plead then that we have
not treated them fairly, for &s;ay they, <Q REND="inline">'Se|condly,
It mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that in the
afore&s;aid Account Notice is taken only of
the Ships of this State, which in Conjun|ction
with tho&s;e of Her Maje&s;ty were em|ploy'd
in the <HI>Mediterr anean</HI> and the <HI>Chan|nel,</HI>
and that the North Sea, which this
State, during the War, has generally had
the Care of, is wholly omitted: Which
Mention of tho&s;e Ships only of this State
which have acted in Conjunction with
tho&s;e of Her Maje&s;ty, and the Omi&s;&s;ion
of the North Sea, make &s;o great a Dif|ference

reckoned by the fore&s;aid Account to have
been furni&s;hed by <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that
&s;aid in the &s;ame Account to be furni&s;hed by
this State, that probably this Difference
gave Occa&s;ion to the forming the fore&s;aid
prejudicial Re&s;olution or Vote of the
<PB N="62" REF="63">
Lower Hou&s;e, which po&s;&s;ibly would not
have been formed, might this State have
fir&s;t been heard upon it.'</Q></P>
<P>This Plea needs no farther Examination
than to look back to the Second Paragraph
of the Admiralty's Report above, where it
is affirm'd, <Q REND="inline">'That by the Treaties between
the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the States-General,
their Proportion of Ships of the

Three to our Five.'</Q></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be &s;urprizing to all that read the
<HI>Memorial</HI> of the States, to hear them in&s;i&s;t
with &s;o many Introductory Paragraphs, and
lay &s;o much &s;tre&s;s upon their Employing
Ships in the North Seas, when it is thus
proved that the North Seas are quite left
out of the Que&s;tion, and the Treaties they
had made were only for Ships to be em|ploy'd
<HI>in the Channel in and about the Medi|terranean.</HI>
Now if they have furni&s;hed their
Quota as agreed upon with us for the <HI>Chan|nel</HI>
and the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> tho' they had &s;ent
no Ships to the North Seas, we conceive
the Commons had made no Repre&s;entation;
nor had they any Rea&s;on, for there was no
mention of it in the Agreements of Treaties
afore&s;aid; but if they have not furni&s;hed
their Quota's for the <HI>Channel,</HI> altho' they
had &s;ent an Hundred Sail to the North Seas,
it had been nothing to the Ca&s;e any more
<PB N="63" REF="64">
than their &s;ending Ships to <HI>Batavia,</HI> for the
&s;ame Rea&s;on as above; the North Sea
Guard being not mention'd in the &s;aid Trea|ties
and Annual Agreements. To what Pur|po&s;e
then is all the long De&s;cription of the
Nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;ending Ships to the North
Seas? And what can be more &s;urprizing than
to find their High Mightine&s;&s;es arguing
what <HI>is,</HI> or <HI>was</HI> their Sentiments, again&s;t
what <HI>is</HI> and <HI>was</HI> at that very Time <HI>concert|ed</HI>
and <HI>adju&s;ted</HI> by them, with the Per&s;ons
actually &s;ent over by the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
for that Purpo&s;e; and which in the
very &s;ame Paragraph they acknowledge
was &s;o <HI>concerted</HI> and <HI>adju&s;ted.</HI> For the more
ready a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Reader to make a Full
and Free Judgment hereof, the long pretend|ed
Defence on that Head is here copied out
of the &s;aid <HI>Memorial,</HI> and is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q REND="inline">'It mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, That by the Seventh
Article of the Treaty of the Ninth of
<HI>June</HI> 1703, by which that Agreement
was renewed, 'Tis provided, that the
Number of Ships of War to be furni&s;hed
by each for their whole Quota according
to the &s;aid Agreement, &s;hould be regula|ted
every Year, and that the Rendezvous,
as well as the Places where the Ships
&s;hould be employed, &s;hould likewi&s;e be
agreed upon every Year; accordingly this
has been concerted Yearly, Her Maje&s;ty
having to that Purpo&s;e for &s;everal Years
&s;ent over one of Her Admirals, at which
<PB N="64" REF="65">
Times Two Things principally were ta|ken
into Deliberation, namely, the Num|ber
of Shipping and the Places where they
&s;hould be employ'd; upon which the Pro|jects
on the Part of Her Maje&s;ty propo&s;ed
commonly the employing a greater Num|ber
than was propo&s;ed by this State, and
al&s;o more Regard was had to the <HI>Channel</HI>
than to the North Sea, of which North
Sea not the lea&s;t Mention is made in the
afore&s;aid Account of the Lords Commi&s;|&s;ioners
of the Admiralty, from which O|mi&s;&s;ion
it partly comes that they reckon
&s;o low what this State has furni&s;hed to
the Sea-&s;ervice. The Sentiment of this
State upon this Subject has alway been,
that the Number of Ships to be &s;ent Year|ly
to Sea ought to be regulated according
to the Force which it might rea&s;onably
be judged the Enemy could Yearly bring
into the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> the <HI>Channel,</HI> and
the North Sea, &s;o that Men might be
morally &s;ure that the Fleets and Squa|drons
which on the Part of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
and this State &s;hould act in Conjunction
or Seperately, would be &s;uperiour to tho&s;e
of the Enemy. The Term, in Conjun|ction
or Separately, was u&s;ed, becau&s;e it
was ever the Opinion of this State, that
Her Maje&s;ty's Ships, and tho&s;e of this
State, &s;ent to <HI>Portugal</HI> and the <HI>Medi|terranean,</HI>
ought to act in Conjunction;
and that the Security of the <HI>Channel</HI> ought
to be left to the Care of Her Maje&s;ty,
<PB N="65" REF="66">
and that of the North Sea to the Care of
this State, becau&s;e the <HI>Channel</HI> is be&s;t &s;i|tuate
for <HI>Great-Britain</HI> with re&s;pect to its
Countries, Harbours, and Commerce, and
the North Sea for this State with re&s;pect
to its Countries, Harbours and Com|merce;
yet &s;o, that if unexpectedly the
Enemy &s;hould bring any Fleet or con&s;i|derable
Squadrons into the <HI>Channel,</HI> or
into the North Sea, then the Squadrons
on both Sides, in Whole or in Part, ac|cording
to the Circum&s;tances of Affairs,
might join each other.'</Q></P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved here, the States General
Fir&s;t acknowledge in this Paragraph of
their <HI>Memorial,</HI> That <HI>both the Number of
Ships to be furni&s;h'd by each Party, and the
Places where tho&s;e Ships &s;hould be employ'd,
was concerted Yearly, Her Maje&s;ty having to
that Purpo&s;e for &s;everal Years &s;ent over one
of Her Admirals:</HI> Nay, they repeat it a|gain,
<HI>viz. At which Times Two Things prin|cipally
were taken into Deliberation,</HI> viz. <HI>The
Number of Shipping, and the Places where
they &s;hould be employ'd.</HI> We can have no
Occa&s;ion to make An&s;wer to this in any o|ther
Manner than by Appeal to the States|General
them&s;elves, and Enquiring then
whether in the Quota's of Ships at tho&s;e
Times agreed on, and the Place where they
&s;hould be employ'd, any Place but the
<HI>Channel</HI> and in and about the <HI>Mediterranean</HI>
was ever included or incerted: If it were,
<PB N="66" REF="67">
then we mu&s;t give it again&s;t the Repre&s;en|tation
of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and ac|quit
the States-General: But if not, what
means all the Preamble and Circumlocution
of this long <HI>Memorial?</HI> And to what Pur|po&s;e
is it &s;aid this or that was the Senti|ments
of the States-General? The Repre|&s;entation
and Addre&s;s of the Commons,
and the Report of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Admiralty,
can &s;ay nothing to what was, or was not,
the Sentiments of the States-General. But
to what was their Agreement, and what
was concerted Yearly between the Queen of
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the States, that they
may enquire about, and that they do re|pre&s;ent
Fairly and Faithfully, <HI>viz.</HI> That
the <HI>Dutch</HI> have not furni&s;hed the Quota's
which they were obliged by Treaty to do,
for the Service of the Con&s;ederates in the
<HI>Channel,</HI> and in or about the <HI>Mediterra|nean</HI>;
what they did in the North Seas
as being no Part of the &s;aid Agreement,
the &s;aid Repre&s;entation has no Ground to
meddle with it, nor does it take the lea&s;t
Notice of it as is &s;uppo&s;ed for that Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>It may not be foreign to this Ca&s;e to en|quire
a little here into the Rea&s;on and E|quity
al&s;o of this Argument about the
North S as Service, in doing whereof, if it
&s;hall be found that this Service ought not
to be thought of in E&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;aid
Quota's of Ships, as being wholly and &s;ole|ly
a Work of Intere&s;t, Protecting their own
<PB N="67" REF="68">
Commerce Fi&s;hing, <HI>&amp;c</HI> in which the Allies
have no Concern, and that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had
at the &s;ame Time &s;everal Squadrons in tho&s;e
Seas which were never e&s;teemed Part of
the &s;aid Quota on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Side, and
therefore that the like ought not to be in|&s;i&s;ted
on on the Part of the States-Gene|ral,
then all the Argument drawn from
the&s;e Things will fall to the Ground, and
the Impre&s;&s;ions which tho&s;e Re&s;olutions
of the Hou&s;e of Commons have made on
the People mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily remain.</P>
<P>It is not que&s;tion'd at all, nor does it
&s;eem material to this Ca&s;e, but that in the
&s;everal Alliances made between <HI>England</HI>
and the States-General they were Mutual|ly
oblig'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other with <HI>all their
Forces.</HI> But this is &s;o far from taking off
the Edge of the Complaint, that it rather
fixes and confirms the &s;ame; for that we
alledge that the <HI>Dutch</HI> have not a&s;&s;i&s;ted
with all their Forces, and to determine the
Signification of the &s;aid Term, and how
the &s;ame is to be under&s;tood, we are to
ob&s;erve, that le&s;t it &s;hould create here|after
any Mi&s;under&s;tanding among the Al|lies,
the &s;everal Quota's or Proportions of
the Allies were &s;ettled between every the
particular Nations Annually. Now the
Parliament's Complaint is clear in this, nor
does the <HI>Memorial</HI> of the States offer one
Word of An&s;wer to it; they do not com|plain
in general, that the States have not
<PB N="68" REF="69">
&s;upply'd their whole Forces, but that they
have not &s;upply'd tho&s;e &s;everal Proporti|ons
by which their whole Forces were by
vertue of their Sub&s;equent Agreement to be
under&s;tood; and this appears from the very
<HI>Memorial</HI> it&s;elf, where their High Mighti|ne&s;&s;es
acknowledge it, and better Proof
cannot be de&s;ired. See their own Words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'By the Seventh Article of the Treaty
of the Ninth of <HI>June</HI> 1703, by which
that Agreement was renewed, 'tis pro|vided,
that the Number of Ships of War
to be furni&s;hed by each for their whole
Quota according to the &s;aid Agreement
&s;hould be regulated every Year, and that
the Rendezvous, as well as the Places
where the Ships &s;hould be employed,
&s;hould likewi&s;e be agreed upon every
Year; accordingly this has been concert|ed
Yearly, Her Maje&s;ty having to that
Purpo&s;e for &s;everal Years &s;ent over one
of Her Admirals, at which Times Two
Things principally were taken into Deli|beration,
namely, the Number of Ship|ping
and the Places where they &s;hould
be employ'd.'</Q></P>
<P>Here it is acknowledg'd by the States
that the Quota's were adju&s;ted between us
and them, both as to Number of Ships,
and where to be employ'd. There are but
Two Objections which the <HI>Memorial</HI> pre|tends
to make after this, the Fir&s;t is, Whe|ther
the Ships which the States furni&s;hed
<PB N="69" REF="70">
for the Guard of the North Seas &s;hould
not be e&s;teemed Part of their Quota, and
Secondly, Whether the Number of Ships
mentioned to be employ'd by Her Maje&s;ty
in the <HI>Channel</HI> and in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI>
were nece&s;&s;ary; the&s;e are al&s;o their own
Words, to which may be briefly an&s;wer'd,
Fir&s;t, That after they had acknowledged,
as above is &s;aid, That <HI>the Number of Ships
and Places where the &s;ame &s;hould be employ'd
were every Year concerted,</HI> it can no more
be asked whether they were nece&s;&s;ary; the
Que&s;tion rather lyes fairly, Whether the
Numbers concerted were re&s;pectively &s;up|ply'd,
if there had appear'd any &s;ub&s;e|quent
Alteration in the Face of the War.
So that if it had &s;eem'd to the States le&s;s ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to &s;end &s;o large a Number of Ships
as was agreed, it mu&s;t have been rea&s;ona|ble
that a new Concert between the Allies
&s;hould have been made, and &s;ome mutual
Agreement offer'd for le&s;&s;ening the &s;aid
Number on both Sides. But to agree Fir&s;t
that &s;uch a Number on both Sides &s;hould
be &s;upplied, and then &s;hortning that
Number on their Side, without &s;ignifying
to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court that they thought few|er
Ships enough, &s;o that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;hould
be left to &s;end their full Quota as agreed,
and the States only make an Abatement,
this can be no Fair Treatment of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h,</HI>
nor is it e&s;teemed fair Dealing in our
Country, whatever it may be in <HI>Holland</HI>;
<PB N="70" REF="71">
therefore the Complaint of the Com|mons
in this Ca&s;e &s;eems very ju&s;t, and is
not at all an&s;wer'd by this <HI>Memorial,</HI> for
that the States-General did not &s;upply the
Number of Ships which by their Annual
Agreement was concerted between them
and Her Maje&s;ty; Secondly, But &s;ay the
States, we did &s;upply a great Squadron in
the North Seas, which ought to be e&s;teem|ed
a Part of our Proportion, and all the
Rea&s;ons given for this Way of acting are,
that &s;uch were the Sentiments of the States|General;
yet in another Part of the &s;aid
<HI>Memorial</HI> it is own'd, and in the Report
of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty it
is expre&s;ly &s;aid, tho&s;e Quota's were &s;ettled
only for &s;uch Ships as were to act Con|junctly
or Separately in the <HI>Channel</HI> and the
<HI>Mediterranean.</HI> But becau&s;e this Argument
is of too much Value to have it depend up|on
the dubious Con&s;truction of Terms, it
may be ob&s;erv'd, Fir&s;t, That there is no
Parity or Equality in this Argument, for
that the Concert of Proportions of Ships
to be &s;upply'd by us and the States re|&s;pected
only the particular Seas, in which
the Power of the <HI>French</HI> was particularly
Formidable, and where their main Fleets
were to be expected, as in the <HI>Streights,</HI>
and the <HI>Channel,</HI> or on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Portu|gal</HI>
and <HI>Spain.</HI> And that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation
have kept great Squadrons and Fleets out
in &s;undry other Parts of the World, as the
<PB N="71" REF="72">
<HI>Dutch</HI> have done in the <HI>North Sea,</HI> with|out
reckoning any &s;uch Ships into the
Quota or Proportions of the Fleets to be
furni&s;hed as before, for the Carrying on
the War, &s;uch have been the Fleets and
Ships con&s;tantly &s;ent to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI>
to <HI>St. Helena,</HI> to the <HI>Canaries,</HI> &amp;c. by
which it appears, that whatever the Sen|timents
of the States of <HI>Holland</HI> have been,
as above, the Sentiments of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Court have always been, that each Ally
ought to have &s;upply'd their full Quota of
&s;uch Ships as were concerted for the Ser|vice
of the War in the <HI>Channel</HI> and in the
<HI>Mediterranean,</HI> without e&s;teeming &s;uch
Ships as Part thereof which they re&s;pective|ly
were obliged to furni&s;h for the Prote|ction
of their Commerce in any other Part
of the World; and that this was the real
Sentiments of the States-General as well as
of Her Maje&s;ty, appears for that in all the
Ships &s;ent by either of the Powers into o|ther
Parts of the World, as into the North
Seas, the <HI>Baltick,</HI> the <HI>We&s;t-Indies, St. He|lena,</HI>
and the like, they very &s;eldom acted
in Conjunction, but &s;ent their re&s;pective
Squadrons &s;eparately, as the Nece&s;&s;ity of
their Affairs requir'd. Nor did tho&s;e Ships
act in Conjunction on any Occa&s;ion, &s;ave
only as they found it nece&s;&s;ary to take the
Ships of each other Nation under Convoy,
or in their Protection, and made u&s;e of
the Harbours of each Confederate as there
<PB N="72" REF="73">
might be Occa&s;ion. This is manife&s;t, in
that notwith&s;tanding the great Fleets
which the States-General have upon all
Occa&s;ions &s;ent to the North Seas, as is al|ledg'd,
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court have been oblig'd
al&s;o to &s;end Annual Squadrons to tho&s;e
Seas for the Safety of their Trade, as well
to <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> as to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Country,</HI> the <HI>Elbe</HI>
and the <HI>We&s;er,</HI> as al&s;o for the Defence of
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI>; which
Ships, tho' equal, if not &s;uperiour, to the
Numbers &s;ent into tho&s;e Seas by the States-General,
have not been accounted by Her
Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ty as any Part of the Proportion of
Ships concerted as above&s;aid with the
States.</P>
<P>This therefore can never be the Rea&s;on
of the Report of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of
the Admiralty; and it is &s;urprizing to
all tho&s;e who know the State of tho&s;e
Things, to hear the <HI>Memorial</HI> &s;ay, the
States General had the Care of the North
Seas, as they do when they &s;um up that
Part of their Ca&s;e as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'It mu&s;t
be ob&s;erved, that in the afore&s;aid Ac|count
Notice is taken only of the Ships
of this State, which in Conjunction with
tho&s;e of Her Maje&s;ty were employed in
the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> and the <HI>Channel</HI>; and
that the North Sea, which this State, du|ring
the War, has generally had the Care
of, is wholly omitted: Which Two
Things, namely, the Mention of tho&s;e
<PB N="73" REF="74">
Ships only of this State which have acted
in Conjunction with tho&s;e of Her Ma|je&s;ty,
and the Omi&s;&s;ion of the North
Sea, make &s;o great a Difference be|tween
the Number of Ships reckoned
by the fore&s;aid Account to have been
furni&s;hed by this State, that probably
this Difference gave Occa&s;ion to the
forming the fore&s;aid prejudicial Re&s;olu|tion
or Vote of the Lower Hou&s;e, which
po&s;&s;ibly would not have been formed
might this State have fir&s;t been heard
upon it.'</Q></P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem Needful here to enter
into an Enquiry what Number of Ships
Her Maje&s;ty has from Time to Time &s;ent
into the North Seas, and how the States-General
may be &s;aid to have had the Care
of the North Seas, when it is well known
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade, nay, and even often the
<HI>Dutch</HI> to <HI>Arch-Angel,</HI> have been Convoy'd
Out and Home by Her Maje&s;ty's Ships;
and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Mouth of
the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and the <HI>Elbe,</HI> have been con|&s;tantly
Guarded by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ships.</P>
<P>Thus by the plaine&s;t Rea&s;oning in the
World the <HI>Memorial</HI> is fallacious, for that
the De&s;iciencies complain'd of remain
con&s;e&s;t by the States them&s;elves, the
Rea&s;ons pretended to ju&s;tify them&s;elves
are directly contrary to the concerted Pro|portions
and Treaties made between the
&s;aid States-General and the Queen's Ma|je&s;ty;
<PB N="74" REF="75">
and this is exactly agreeable to
the Report of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the
Admiralty, and the Re&s;olutions of the
Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>The like fallacious Way of Arguing ap|pears
in the Ca&s;e of the Land-Forces or
Troops, in which &s;till their High Migh|tine&s;&s;es
do not deny the Matter of Fact
alledged in the &s;aid Addre&s;s, but excu&s;e
and extenuate the &s;ame by their Efforts
otherways, as particularly, they alledge
an Article of their Rai&s;ing Troops before

<HI>that is,</HI> that they having rai|&s;ed
Fifty Thou&s;and Men before us, they
&s;hould be therefore allowed to maintain
Fewer than they agreed for afterwards;
or to &s;peak plainly, that becau&s;e they
were obliged to a quicker Armament than
the <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> therefore they were to have
leave to break in upon future Concert,
and fail in the Numbers they were to
bring in afterward: This &s;eems no un|fair
