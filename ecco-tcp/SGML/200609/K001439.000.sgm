<HEAD>AN ANSWER TO THE L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;ham's SPEECH.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By <HI>Daniel D' Foe.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>HAD the Subject of this Paper, been able to &s;tay but one Week more, it had not been a Digre&s;&s;ion; the determin'd Cour&s;e of the <HI>Reviews,</HI> being then to Review to the Subject of Trade, and the general State of things; and as the daily Flux of Subject for this Paper is &s;uch, that I di&s;pair to return yet a great while to my Original De&s;ign, as to <HI>France</HI>; I &s;hall turn this Paper for the Pre&s;ent to be a <HI>Review</HI> of the State of the Nation; and I do not ob|lige my &s;elf that the next Volume may not bear that Title.</P>
<P>I find a Paper Cry'd about Town, with an Unu&s;ual Earne&s;tne&s;s; Entituled, the Lord <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;ham</HI>'s Speech, in the Hou&s;e of Peers&mdash;I think my &s;elf oblig'd, before I enter upon the Particulars, to make a &s;hort Introduction, relating to my manner of Treating the Ca&s;e I am upon, which is expected to be an An&s;wer to that Paper.</P>
<P>I am going to An&s;wer my Lord <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;ham</HI>'s Speech; but if I may &s;ay any thing to certain Points, hinted at in the Paper, call'd by that Title; they are welcome to call mine an <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> or what el&s;e they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>That the Lord <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;ham,</HI> made a Speech in the Hou&s;e of Lords, is no part of my Enquiry, nor &s;hall I meddle with what was Tran&s;|acted there, I know the Duty of an Author, with Re&s;pect to what is done or &s;aid in that A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The Paper Publi&s;h'd, I think, &s;hows it &s;elf in a double Capacity, <HI>as a Speech, and as a Pamphlet</HI>; as a Speech I have nothing to &s;ay to it; but as a Pamphlet with no Author's Name to it, it may be any bodies,
<PB N="2" REF="2">
and may be An&s;wer'd by any body; 'tis an Appeal to the People, a Challenge to every Reader; and I am at liberty, as well as another, to Remark upon it.</P>
<P>As a Pamphlet, I &s;ay, I may be concern'd with it, and no otherwi&s;e; the Anonymous Author is nothing to me, be it a Lord or a Tinker; there is no Name to it, to Vouch the Particulars; and I believe in|deed, no Man would ever &s;et his Name to it, that valu'd the Repu|tation of his Character; either for Truth, Under&s;tanding, or Good Manners.</P>
<P>Let the Speech be what it will, and who&s;e it will, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the Publication of it &s;eems to me, to have &s;omething in it, that I cannot allow, to be the Noble Lords doing; whatever has an Air in its Countenance, Calculated or &s;crew'd up to a pitch of Malecontent and Chagrin, as if it was done on purpo&s;e to &s;ower the Nation, can|not be Publi&s;h'd with a good de&s;ign; let the Saying, or Speaking this any where, be done with what de&s;ign it will, the Printing of it, can, in my Poor Opinion have no Meaning, but what is Mi&s;chievous and Unpeaceable.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;tated the Ca&s;e, between the <HI>Review</HI> and the <HI>Pamphlet</HI> I &s;peak of, I &s;hall lead my Reader no farther about.</P>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour to &s;peak as plain, as the Deference and Regard due to Dignity and Quality of Per&s;ons will permit; I wi&s;h the Noble Lord, who they &s;ay made this Speech, would give me leave to An|&s;wer, Paragraph by Paragraph every Article, without taking the Ad|vantages, Laws and Power furni&s;hes him with, upon any rea&s;onable Penalty, if I did not give, what even the whole Hou&s;e of Lords &s;hould determine a full An&s;wer.</P>
<P>But Limited by that Article of Quality, I &s;hall refrain an An&s;wer, as an An&s;wer to this Speech, and only handle the Subject, without pointing at the Per&s;on.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Paragraph, in the Paper above, which is all I &s;hall recite, makes the Author Addre&s;s in the Fir&s;t Per&s;on <HI>My Lords,</HI> as Introdu|ctory to &s;omething he has to &s;ay, Relating to the State of the Nation; and Nothing, that <HI>the be&s;t way of Pre&s;erving the Liberty of Speech, is to make u&s;e of it</HI>; tells them, he will &s;peak to three or four Generals very plainly; if he had &s;aid Cour&s;ly, he <HI>had &s;aid <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"></HI></P>
<P>Four Heads are treated of in this Paper; and I al&s;o purpo&s;e to treat of the &s;ame four Heads among many other; if my Lord <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;ham</HI>'s Opinion and mine differ, I hope neither this Paper nor its Author, are bound to Sacri|fice his Judgment to his Manners; I &s;hall treat the Name the Speech is call'd by, in no Terms beneath his Quality, and have nothing to ask his Lord&s;hip's Pardon for, but for di&s;cour&s;ing of the &s;ame Points, with him&s;elf; which I hope his Lord&s;hip will allow me the Liberty to do; the Particulars are,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Con&s;ederate War.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Trade of <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="3" REF="3">
3. The Right of Princes, to take Notice of things done in Parliament, but not brought to their Knowledge, in a Parliamentary manner.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The bringing over the Pre&s;umptive Heir of the Crown to re&s;ide here.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I begin with the la&s;t of the&s;e, and I &s;hall no more take Notice, that the&s;e have been the Subject of any Speech; nor do I know they have been; I know this Ar|ticle has been &s;tarted in Print before now, by an Author, who&s;e Principle is as well known as his Paper; and as his Propo&s;al I &s;hall &s;peak to it, and of him I mu&s;t &s;ay; as an Old Man &s;aid to his Poor Nephew; who waited for his Death to come to his E&s;tate; The <HI>young Fellow,</HI> Advis'd him to Remove to a certain Place in the Country for his Health, which, as he &s;aid, was a better Air; <HI>I believe 'tis a better Air,</HI> &s;ays the Old Man, <HI>but I do not fan&s;ie the Place: Why &s;o, Sir,</HI> &s;ays the Nephew&mdash;<HI>Becau&s;e you Propo&s;e it,</HI> &s;ays he; <HI>for what can you get by my Livi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">g?</HI></P>
<P>Now, Mr. <HI>Politicus,</HI> as this Author would be call'd, we could be glad to &s;ee the Heir of the Crown among us, but we cannot fancy the Propo&s;al, becau&s;e you make it; for what can your Party get by it? What Advantage can it be to your Party, to bring tho&s;e over, that we know you hate? And how can you think but we mu&s;t &s;u&s;pect your Integrity? An Old Lyon, that by his Age and Infirmities was grown heavy, and could hardly get his Living as he u&s;ed to do; his Joynts &s;tiff with the Exce&s;&s;es of his Youth, his Claws broke, and his Teeth rotten, ju&s;t as it fares with Mr. <HI>Mercurius Politicus</HI>'s Party. To &s;upply the Defects of his Power, with the Helps of his Cunning, feigns him&s;elf very &s;ick; and being near the point of Death, invites all his Subjects of the Horn and the Hoof, to come and vi&s;it him; pretends he had great need of their A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and withal, that it was very convenient to have them near him; and that he had &s;everal things to tell them for the publick Safety. Away comes the Inhabitants of the adjacent Woods, out of their Holes and &s;ecure places, where they were far enough out of his Reach, to Vi&s;it this Old Devourer. When he had thus got them in|to his Power, he watches his Opportunity, flies upon them, and De|vours them all.</P>
<P>The&s;e old Stories, and Fifty more &s;uch I could tell them, might give us very good Caution when the&s;e Foxes preach to beware of the Gee&s;e; but of that by the way. The Propo&s;al of bringing over the Prince&s;s of <HI>Hannover,</HI> is &s;pecious, and &s;eems to lay a Difficulty in the way of a great many hone&s;t &s;ubjects, as if not complying with it, &s;hould be ta|ken for a Di&s;re&s;pect to that Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e, which will be&s;t appear, when a little farther Examin'd into; for all things are not to be judg|ed of by their Out&s;ides.</P>
<P>No Man more &s;incerely joins in the Satlement of the Succe&s;&s;ion, and rejoyces in the Safety of <HI>England</HI> on that head, than the Author of this Paper; and when we talk of Inviting the Princes of the Line Royal hither, all that de&s;ire their Peaceable Enjoyment of the Crown would without doubt bid them welcome, and be glad to &s;ee them round the Throne, as &s;ome call it.</P>
<P>But when we talk of the Re&s;pect due to the Illu&s;trious Branches of our Succe&s;&s;ion, 'tis one thing; and when we talk of the Security and Safety of <HI>England,</HI> 'tis another: and in this Ca&s;e, with all manner of Duty and Re&s;pect to the Succe&s;&s;ors of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown, I freely &s;ay, <HI>We are as &s;ecure without them as with them.</HI> To &s;ay it would be a fine
<PB N="4" REF="4">
Court, or a plea&s;ant thing; if all the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover</HI> was here, a great deal of Gallantry and &s;ome Trade might be the Con&s;equence; this has &s;omething in it, and not much: But when we talk of Safety and Danger, 'tis not the Di&s;tance of our Princes can influence the Matter; an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament is the Security of <HI>England,</HI> again&s;t all the inter|vening Accidents, and how ea&s;y is all that Pretence fallen to the Ground now, in one Vote of the Hou&s;e of Lords?</P>
<P>Publick Safety is a fine gilded Pretence, and Sounds very popular; but it is not always meant mo&s;t, where it is mo&s;t talk'd of; and Secu|rity of the Queen, from the Heirs being at her Elbow; I cannot fore&s;ee the Security of the Queen con&s;i&s;ts in the hearts of her People, which I believe no Prince for &s;ome Ages has more intirely po&s;&s;e&s;s'd; and I can|not &s;ay the Queen had been more &s;ecure in the Life of the Duke of <HI>Glo|ce&s;ter</HI>; it had been a Joy and Comfort both to the Queen and the whole Nation, if it had plea&s;ed God to have &s;pared that Prince, who&s;e Lo&s;s is a Grief to all that reflect on it, and who have any value for their Sovereign.</P>
<P>But &s;till as to Safety, as to the Publick Security, it con&s;i&s;ts not in Per&s;ons, but in things; if God for our &s;ins &s;hould take away every Branch of that Il|lu&s;trious Stock, from whence we hope for &s;uch a Succe&s;&s;ion of Princes; I am of Opinion, and think 'tis plain, the Foundation of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown and Go|vernment &s;tands too fa&s;t to be &s;haken: 'Tis built upon this Fundemental Ma|xim of State, recorded in Parliament, and which all the Nation concurs in, <HI>That we will not have</HI> a Popi&s;h Prince <HI>to Reign over us.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>England</HI> is our Security for the making this good; and it can neither add nor dimini&s;h to this Security, how or to what extent it may plea&s;e God to lengthen the Lives of the Succe&s;&s;ors to the Crown.</P>
<P>Nor does it &s;eem to me a matter of any great Moment, the acquainting the Heir with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prelates; in our Ca&s;e the pre&s;ent Pre&s;umtive Heir being very unlikely to &s;ucceed; her Maje&s;ty, God be prai&s;ed, is in good Health, and much more likely to reign 30 or 40 years; God forbid I &s;hould &s;tint her Maje&s;ty, than a Prince&s;s of above 70 is to &s;ucceed; and in this Ca&s;e I would fain ask Mr. <HI>Politicus,</HI> Who would you have brought over? if you examine the Heirs to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown, 'tis three to one again&s;t all the three alternate|ly wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;hall enjoy it; I mean as to re&s;pect of Age and natural Probabilities: 'Tis 20 to one again&s;t the old Lady, the immediate Pre&s;umtive Heir; to what pur|po&s;e then would they bring that Prince&s;s over in her old Age, but to &s;hortten her Days by changing the Air and her manner of Living? 'Tis then at lea&s;t an even Wa|ger again&s;t the Elector Regent, and I know no body &s;o weak to talk of his Highne&s;s coming over, to quit his Soverign Dominion, and the Admini&s;tration of his Affairs, to come hither to live in the Quality of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobleman, and wait for the Queen Shoes who is, God be thank'd, likely to live as long as him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ere is that young Elector Prince, and of him it is perhaps odds &s;ix to four, that &s;ome time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> he may enjoy it; but 'tis at lea&s;t three to two that he does not enjoy it next to the Queen; and on what pretence can it be moved to &s;end for this Prince over? if he were here when the Queen &s;hould happen to die, he could be no Security, he could not act but by Commi&s;&s;ion from his Father or Grandmother, unle&s;s by Name e&s;tabli&s;h'd in Parliament, as Lord Ju&s;tice, or Commi&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="5+ letters">, or &s;ome other Title; and that's done already in naming &s;even or eight Lord Ju&s;tices to act in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">: &s;o that any of the&s;e ways this Propo&s;al &s;ignifies ju&s;t nothing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> Su&s;picio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">, that &s;ome Snake lies hid in the Gra&s;s; of which hereafter.</HI></P>
