<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the DIFFERENT SPECIES of PHILOSOPHY.</HEAD>
<P>MORAL philo&s;ophy, or the &s;cience of human
nature, may be treated after two different
manners; each of which has its peculiar merit, and
may contribute to the entertainment, in&s;truction, and
reformation of mankind. The one con&s;iders man
chiefly as born for action; and as influenced in his
actions by ta&s;te and &s;entiment; pur&s;uing one object,
and avoiding another, according to the value which
the&s;e objects &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and according to the
light in which they pre&s;ent them&s;elves. Virtue, of all
objects, is the mo&s;t valuable and lovely; and accor|dingly
this &s;pecies of philo&s;ophers paint her in the
mo&s;t amiable colours; borrowing all helps from poe|try
and eloquence, and treating their &s;ubject in an
ea&s;y and obvious manner, &s;uch as is be&s;t fitted to
plea&s;e the imagination, and engage the affections.
They &s;elect the mo&s;t &s;triking ob&s;ervations and in|&s;tances
from common life; place oppo&s;ite characters
<PB N="4" REF="7">
in a proper contra&s;t; and alluring us into the paths
of virtue by the views of glory and happine&s;s, direct
our &s;teps in the&s;e paths by the &s;ounde&s;t precepts and
mo&s;t illu&s;trious examples. They make us <HI>feel</HI> the
difference betwixt vice and virtue; they excite and
regulate our &s;entiments; and &s;o they can but bend
our hearts to the love of probity and true honour,
they think, that they have fully attained the end of all
their labours.</P>
<P>THE other &s;pecies of philo&s;ophers treat man rather
as a rea&s;onable than an active being, and endeavour
to form his under&s;tanding more than cultivate his
manners. They regard mankind as a &s;ubject of &s;pe|culation;
and with a narrow &s;crutiny examine human
nature, in order to find tho&s;e principles, which regu|late
our under&s;tanding, excite our &s;entiments, and
make us approve or blame any particular object, ac|tion,
or behaviour. They think it a reproach to all
literature, that philo&s;ophy &s;hould not yet have fixed,
beyond controver&s;y, the foundation of morals, rea&s;on|ing,
and critici&s;m, and &s;hould for ever talk of truth
and fal&s;ehood, vice and virtue, beauty and deformity,
without being able to determine the &s;ource of the&s;e
di&s;tinctions. While they attempt this arduous ta&s;k,
they are deterred by no difficulties; but proceeding
from particular in&s;tances to general principles, they
&s;till pu&s;h on their inquiries to principles more gene|ral,
and re&s;t not &s;atisfied till they arrive at tho&s;e ori|ginal
<PB N="5" REF="8">
principles, by which, in every &s;cience, all hu|man
cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">io&s;ity mu&s;t be bounded. Tho' their &s;pecula|tions
&s;eem ab&s;tract, and even unintelligible to com|mon
readers, they plea&s;e them&s;elves with the appro|bation
of the learned and the wi&s;e; and think them|&s;elves
&s;ufficiently compen&s;ated for the labours of their
whole lives, if they can di&s;cover &s;ome hidden truths,
which may contribute to the in&s;truction of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>'TIS certain, that the ea&s;y and obvious philo&s;ophy
will always, with the generality of mankind, have
the preference to the accurate and ab&s;tru&s;e; and by
many will be recommended, not only as more agree|able,
but more u&s;eful than the other. It enters more
into common life; moulds the heart and affections;
and, by touching tho&s;e principles which actuate men,
reforms their conduct, and brings them nearer that mo|del
of perfection which it de&s;cribes. On the contrary,
the ab&s;tru&s;e philo&s;ophy, being founded on a turn of
mind, which cannot enter into bu&s;ine&s;s and action,
vani&s;hes when the philo&s;opher leaves the &s;hade, and
comes into open day; nor can its principles ea&s;ily re|tain
any influence over our conduct and behaviour.
The feelings of our &s;entiments, the agitations of our
pa&s;&s;ions, the vehemence of our affections, di&s;&s;ipate all
its conclu&s;ions, and reduce the profound philo&s;opher
to a mere plebeian.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9">
THIS al&s;o mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the mo&s;t durable,
as well as ju&s;te&s;t fame has been acquired by the ea&s;y
philo&s;ophy, and that ab&s;tract rea&s;oners &s;eem hitherto
to have enjoyed only a momentary reputation, from
the caprice or ignorance of their own age, but have
not been able to &s;upport their renown with more
equitable po&s;terity. 'Tis ea&s;y for a profound philo|&s;opher
to commit a mi&s;take in his &s;ubtile rea&s;onings;
and one mi&s;take is the nece&s;&s;ary parent of another,
while he pu&s;hes on his con&s;equences, and is not de|terred
from embracing any conclu&s;ion, by its unu&s;ual
appearance, or its contradiction to popular opinion.
But a philo&s;opher, who propo&s;es only to repre&s;ent the
common &s;en&s;e of mankind in more beautiful and
more engaging colours, if by accident he commits a
mi&s;take, goes no farther; but renewing his appeal to
common &s;en&s;e, and the natural &s;entiments of the
mind, returns into the right path, and &s;ecures him|&s;elf
from any dangerous illu&s;ions. The fame of CI|CERO
flouri&s;hes at pre&s;ent; but that of ARISTOTLE
is utterly decayed. La BRUYERE pa&s;&s;es the &s;eas,
and &s;till maintains his reputation: But the glory of
MALEBRANCHE is confined to his own nation, and to
his own age. And ADDISON, perhaps, will be read
with plea&s;ure, when LOCKE &s;hall be intirely for|gotten.</P>
<P>THE
mere philo&s;opher is a character which is
commonly but little acceptable in the world, as being
<PB N="7" REF="10">
&s;uppo&s;ed to contribute nothing either to the advan|tage
or plea&s;ure of &s;ociety; while he lives remote
from communication with mankind, and is wrapped
up in principles and notions equally remote from
their comprehen&s;ion. On the other hand, the mere
ignorant is &s;till more de&s;pi&s;ed; nor is any thing
deemed a &s;urer &s;ign of an illiberal genius in an age
and nation where the &s;ciences flouri&s;h, than to be in|tirely
void of all reli&s;h for tho&s;e noble entertainments.
The mo&s;t perfect character is &s;uppo&s;ed to lie between
tho&s;e extremes; retaining an equal ability and ta&s;te
for books, company, and bu&s;ine&s;s; pre&s;erving in con|ver&s;ation
that di&s;cernment and delicacy which ari&s;e
from polite letters; and in bu&s;ine&s;s, that probity and
accuracy which are the natural re&s;ult of a ju&s;t philo|&s;ophy.
In order to diffu&s;e and cultivate &s;o accom|pli&s;hed
a character, nothing can be more u&s;eful than
compo&s;itions of the ea&s;y &s;tyle and manner, which draw
not too much from life, require no deep application
or retreat to be comprehended, and &s;end back the &s;tu|dent
among mankind full of noble &s;entiments and
wi&s;e precepts, applicable to every exigence of human
life. By means of &s;uch compo&s;itions, virtue becomes
amiable, &s;cience agreeable, company in&s;tructive, and
retirement entertaining.</P>
<P>MAN is a rea&s;onable being; and as &s;uch, receives
from &s;cience his proper food and nouri&s;hment: But &s;o
narrow are the bounds of human under&s;tanding, that
<PB N="8" REF="11">
little &s;atisfaction can be hoped for in this particular?
either from the extent or &s;ecurity of his acqui&s;itions.
Man is a &s;ociable, no le&s;s than a rea&s;onable being:
But neither can he always enjoy company agreeable
and amu&s;ing, or pre&s;erve the proper reli&s;h of them.
Man is al&s;o an active being; and from that di&s;po|&s;ition,
as well as from the various nece&s;&s;ities of hu|man
life, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to bu&s;ine&s;s and occupation:
But the mind requires &s;ome relaxation, and cannot
always &s;upport its bent to care and indu&s;try. It
&s;eems, then, that nature has pointed out a mixed kind
of life as mo&s;t &s;uitable to human race, and &s;ecretly ad|moni&s;hed
them to allow none of the&s;e bia&s;&s;es to <HI>draw</HI>
too much, &s;o as to incapacitate them for other occu|pations
and entertainments. Indulge your pa&s;&s;ion
for &s;cience, &s;ays &s;he, but let your &s;cience be human,
and &s;uch as may have a direct reference to action and
&s;ociety. Ab&s;tru&s;e thought and profound re&s;earches I
prohibit, and will &s;everely puni&s;h, by the pen&s;ive me|lancholy
which they introduce, by the endle&s;s uncer|tainty
in which they involve you, and by the cold re|ception
which your pretended di&s;coveries will meet
with, when communicated. Be a philo&s;opher; but,
amid&s;t all your philo&s;ophy, be &s;till a man.</P>
<P>WERE the generality of mankind contented to pre|fer
the ea&s;y philo&s;ophy to the ab&s;tract and profound,
without throwing any blame or contempt on the lat|ter,
it might not be improper, perhaps, to comply
<PB N="9" REF="12">
with this general opinion, and allow every man to
enjoy, without oppo&s;ition, his own ta&s;te and &s;enti|ment.
But as the matter is often carried farther,
even to the ab&s;olute rejecting all profound rea&s;onings,
or what is commonly called <HI>metaphy&s;ics,</HI> we &s;hall now
proceed to con&s;ider what can rea&s;onably be pleaded in
their behalf.</P>
<P>WE may begin with ob&s;erving, that one con&s;ider|able
advantage which re&s;ults from the accurate and ab|&s;tract
philo&s;ophy, is, its &s;ub&s;erviency to the ea&s;y and
humane; which, without the former, can never attain
a &s;ufficient degree of exactne&s;s in its &s;entiments, pre|cepts,
or rea&s;onings. All polite letters are nothing
but pictures of human life in various attitudes and &s;i|tuations;
and in&s;pire us with different &s;entiments, of
prai&s;e or blame, admiration or ridicule, according to
the qualities of the object which they &s;et before us.
An arti&s;t mu&s;t be better qualified to &s;ucceed in this
undertaking, who, be&s;ides a delicate ta&s;te and a quick
apprehen&s;ion, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an accurate knowledge of the
internal fabric, the operations of the under&s;tanding,
the workings of the pa&s;&s;ions, and the various &s;pecies
of &s;entiment which di&s;criminate vice and virtue. How|ever
painful this inward &s;earch or inquiry may appear,
it becomes, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, requi&s;ite to tho&s;e, who
would de&s;cribe with &s;ucce&s;s the obvious and outward
appearances of life and manners. The anatomi&s;t pre|&s;ents
to the eye the mo&s;t hideous and di&s;agreeable ob|jects;
<PB N="10" REF="13">
but his &s;cience is highly u&s;eful to the painter in
delineating even a VENUS or an HELEN. While
the latter employs all the riche&s;t colours of his art,
and gives his figures the mo&s;t graceful and engaging
airs; he mu&s;t &s;till carry his attention to the inward
&s;tructure of the human body, the po&s;ition of the mu&s;|cles,
the fabric of the bones, and the u&s;e and figure of
every part or organ. Accuracy is, in every ca&s;e, ad|vantageous
to beauty, and ju&s;t rea&s;oning to delicate
&s;entiments. In vain would we exalt the one by de|preciating
the other.</P>
<P>BESIDES, we may ob&s;erve, in every art or profe&s;|&s;ion,
even tho&s;e which mo&s;t concern life or action,
that a &s;pirit of accuracy, however acquired, carries all
of them nearer their perfection, and renders them
more &s;ub&s;ervient to the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety. And tho'
a philo&s;opher may live remote from bu&s;ine&s;s, the ge|nius
of philo&s;ophy, if carefully cultivated by &s;everal,
mu&s;t gradually diffu&s;e it&s;elf thro' the whole &s;ociety,
and be&s;tow a &s;imilar correctne&s;s on every art and call|ing.
The politician will acquire greater fore&s;ight
and &s;ubtilty, in the &s;ubdividing and balancing of
power; the lawyer more method and finer principles
in his rea&s;onings; and the general more regularity in
his di&s;cipline, and more caution in his plans and ope|ration.
The &s;tability of modern governments above
the antient, and the accuracy of modern philo&s;ophy,
<PB N="11" REF="14">
have improved, and probably will &s;till improve, by
&s;imilar gradations.</P>
<P>WERE there no advantage to be reaped from the&s;e
&s;tudies, beyond the gratification of an innocent curi|o&s;ity,
yet ought not even this to be de&s;pi&s;ed; as being
one acce&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e few &s;afe and harmle&s;s plea&s;ures
which are be&s;towed on human race. The &s;weete&s;t
and mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive path of life leads thro' the ave|nues
of &s;cience and learning; and whoever can either
remove any ob&s;tructions in this way, or open up any
new pro&s;pect, ought &s;o far to be e&s;teemed a benefac|tor
to mankind. And tho' the&s;e re&s;earches may ap|pear
painful and fatiguing, 'tis with &s;ome minds as
with &s;ome bodies, which being endowed with vigorous
and florid health, require &s;evere exerci&s;e, and reap a
plea&s;ure from what, to the generality of mankind, may
&s;eem burden&s;ome and laborious. Ob&s;curity, indeed,
is painful to the mind as well as to the eye; but to
bring light from ob&s;curity, by whatever labour, mu&s;t
needs be delightful and rejoicing.</P>
<P>BUT this ob&s;curity, in the profound and ab&s;tract
philo&s;ophy, is objected to, not only as painful and
fatiguing, but as the inevitable &s;ource of uncertainty
and error. Here indeed lies the ju&s;te&s;t and mo&s;t plau|&s;ible
objection again&s;t a con&s;iderable part of meta|phy&s;ics,
that they are not properly a &s;cience, but ari&s;e ei|ther
from the fruitle&s;s efforts of human vanity, which
<PB N="12" REF="15">
would penetrate into &s;ubjects utterly inacce&s;&s;ible to
the under&s;tanding, or from the craft of popular &s;uper|&s;tition,
which, being unable to defend them&s;elves on
fair ground, rai&s;e the&s;e intangling brambles to cover
and protect their weakne&s;s. Chaced from the open
country, the&s;e robbers fly into the fore&s;t, and lie in
wait to break in upon every unguarded avenue of the
mind, and overwhelm it with religious fears and pre|judices.
The &s;toute&s;t antagoni&s;t, if he remits his
watch a moment, is oppre&s;&s;ed. And many, thro'
cowardice and folly, open the gates to the enemies,
and willingly receive them with reverence and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion,
as their legal &s;overeigns.</P>
<P>BUT is this a ju&s;t cau&s;e why philo&s;ophers &s;hould de|&s;i&s;t
from &s;uch re&s;earches, and leave &s;uper&s;tition &s;till in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her retreat? Is it not rea&s;onable to draw a
direct contrary conclu&s;ion, and perceive the nece&s;&s;ity
of carrying the war into the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of the
enemy? In vain do we hope, that men, from fre|quent
di&s;appointments, will at laft abandon &s;uch airy
&s;ciences, and di&s;cover the proper province of human
rea&s;on. For, be&s;ides that many per&s;ons find too &s;en|&s;ible
an intere&s;t in perpetually recalling &s;uch topics;
be&s;ides this, I &s;ay, the motive of blind de&s;pair can ne|ver
rea&s;onably have place in the &s;ciences; &s;ince, how|ever
un&s;ucce&s;sful former attempts may have proved,
there is &s;till room to hope, that the indu&s;try, good
fortune, or improved &s;agacity of &s;ucceeding genera|tions
<PB N="13" REF="16">
may reach di&s;coveries unknown to former ages.
Each adventurous genius will &s;till leap at the arduous
prize, and find him&s;elf &s;timulated, rather than di&s;cou|raged,
by the failures of his predece&s;&s;ors; while he
hopes, that the glory of atchieving &s;o hard an adven|ture
is re&s;erved for him alone. The only method of
freeing learning, at once, from the&s;e ab&s;tru&s;e que&s;tions,
is to inquire &s;eriou&s;ly into the nature of human under|&s;tanding,
and &s;hew, from an exact analy&s;is of its
powers and capacity, that it is by no means &s;itted for
&s;uch remote and ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ubjects. We mu&s;t &s;ubmit
to this fatigue, in order to live at ea&s;e for ever after:
And mu&s;t cultivate true metaphy&s;ics with &s;ome care,
in order to de&s;troy the fal&s;e and adulterate. Indolence,
which to &s;ome per&s;ons, affords a &s;afeguard again&s;t this
deceitful philo&s;ophy, is, with others, overbalanced by
curio&s;ity; and de&s;pair, which, at &s;ome moments, pre|vails,
may give place afterwards to &s;anguine hopes
and expectations. Accurate and ju&s;t rea&s;oning is the
only catholic remedy, &s;itted for all per&s;ons and all
di&s;po&s;itions, and is alone able to &s;ubvert that ab&s;tru&s;e
philo&s;ophy and metaphy&s;ical jargon, which being
mixed up with popular &s;uper&s;tition, renders it in a
manner impenetrable to carele&s;s rea&s;oners, and gives
it the air of &s;cience and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>BESIDES this advantage of rejecting, after deli|berate
inquiry, the mo&s;t uncertain and di&s;agreeable
part of learning, there are many po&s;itive advantages,
<PB N="14" REF="17">
which re&s;ult from an accurate &s;crutiny into the powers
and &s;aculties of human nature. 'Tis remarkable con|cerning
the operations of the mind, that tho' mo&s;t in|timately
pre&s;ent to us, yet whenever they become the
object of reflection, they &s;eem involved in ob&s;curity,
nor can the eye readily find tho&s;e lines and bounda|ries,
which di&s;criminate and di&s;tingui&s;h them. The
objects are too fine to remain long in the &s;ame a&s;pect
or &s;ituation; and mu&s;t be apprehended, in an in|&s;tant,
by a &s;uperior penetration, derived from nature,
and improved by habit and reflection. It becomes,
therefore, no incon&s;iderable part of &s;cience barely to
know the different operations of the mind, to &s;eparate
them from each other, to cla&s;s them under their pro|per
divi&s;ions, and to correct all that &s;eeming di&s;order,
in which they lie involved, when made the object of
reflection and inquiry. This ta&s;k of ordering and
di&s;tingui&s;hing, which has no merit, when performed
with regard to external bodies, the objects of our &s;en|&s;es,
ri&s;es in its value, when directed towards the ope|rations
of the mind, in proportion to the difficulty and
labour which we meet with in performing it. And if
we can go no farther than this mental geography, or
delineation of the di&s;tinct parts and powers of the
mind, 'tis at lea&s;t a &s;atisfaction to go &s;o far; and the
more obvious this &s;cience may appear (and it is by no
means obvious) the more contemptible &s;till mu&s;t the
ignorance of it be e&s;teemed in all pretenders to learn|ing
and philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18">
NOR can there remain any &s;u&s;picion, that this &s;ci|ence
is uncertain and chimerical; unle&s;s we &s;hould en|tertain
&s;uch a &s;ceptici&s;m as is intirely &s;ubver&s;ive of all
&s;peculation, and even action. It cannot be doubted,
that the mind is endowed with &s;everal powers and fa|culties,
that the&s;e powers are totally di&s;tinct from each
other, that what is really di&s;tinct to the immediate per|ception
may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by reflection; and con|&s;equently,
that there is a truth and fal&s;hood in all pro|po&s;itions
on this &s;ubject, and a truth and fal&s;hood,
which lie not beyond the compa&s;s of human under|&s;tanding.
There are many obvious di&s;tinctions of
this kind, &s;uch as tho&s;e between the will and under|&s;tanding,
the imagination and pa&s;&s;ions, which fall
within the comprehen&s;ion of every human creature;
and the finer and more philo&s;ophical di&s;tinctions are no
le&s;s real and certain, tho' more difficult to be com|prehended.
Some in&s;tances, e&s;pecially late ones, of
&s;ucce&s;s in the&s;e inquiries, may give us a ju&s;ter notion
of the certainty and &s;olidity of this branch of learning.
And &s;hall we e&s;teem it worthy the labour of a philo|&s;opher
to give us a true &s;y&s;tem of the planets, and ad|ju&s;t
the po&s;ition and order of tho&s;e remote bodies;
while we affect to overlook tho&s;e, who, with &s;o much
&s;ucce&s;s, delineate the parts of the mind, in which we
are &s;o intimately concerned?</P>
<P>BUT may we not hope, that philo&s;ophy, if culti|vated
with care, and encouraged by the attention of
<PB N="16" REF="19">
the public, may carry its re&s;earches &s;till farther, and
di&s;cover, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree, the &s;ecret &s;prings and
principles, by which the human mind is actuated in its
operations? A&s;tronomers had long contented them|&s;elves
with proving, from the phaenomena, the true
motions, order, and magnitude of the heavenly bodies:
Till a philo&s;opher, at la&s;t, aro&s;e, who &s;eems from the
happie&s;t rea&s;oning, to have al&s;o determined the laws
and forces by which the revolutions of the planets are
governed and directed. The like has been performed
with regard to other parts of nature. And there is no
rea&s;on to de&s;pair of equal &s;ucce&s;s in our inquiries con|cerning
the mental powers and oeconomy, if pro&s;ecu|red
with equal capacity and caution. 'Tis probable,
that one operation and principle of the mind depends
on another; which, again, may be re&s;olved into one
more general and univer&s;al: And how far the&s;e re|&s;earches
may po&s;&s;ibly be carried, it will be difficult for
us, before, or even after, a careful trial, exactly to de|termine.
This is certain, that attempts of this kind
are every day made even by tho&s;e who philo&s;ophize
the mo&s;t negligently: and nothing can be more re|qui&s;ite
than to enter upon the enterprize with thorough
care and attention; that, if it lie within the compa&s;e
of human under&s;tanding, it may at la&s;t be happily at|chieved;
if not, it may, however, be rejected with
&s;ome confidence and &s;ecurity. This la&s;t conclu&s;ion'
&s;urrely, is not de&s;ireable, nor ought it to be embraced
too ra&s;hly. For how much mu&s;t we dimini&s;h from
<PB N="17" REF="20">
the beauty and value of this &s;pecies of philo&s;ophy, up|on
&s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition? Morali&s;ts have hitherto been
accu&s;tomed, when they con&s;idered the va&s;t multitude
and diver&s;ity of actions that excite our approbation or
di&s;like, to &s;earch for &s;ome common principle, on which
this variety of &s;entiments might depend. And tho'
they have &s;ometimes carried the matter too far, by
their pa&s;&s;ion for &s;ome one general principle; it mu&s;t,
however, be confe&s;&s;ed, that they are excu&s;able, in ex|pecting
to find &s;ome general principles, into which
all the vices and virtues were ju&s;tly to be re&s;olved.
The like has been the endeavour of critics, logicians,
and even politicians: Nor have their attempts been
wholly un&s;ucce&s;sful; tho' perhaps longer time, great|er
accuracy, and more ardent application may bring
the&s;e &s;ciences &s;till nearer their perfection. To throw
up at once all preten&s;ions of this kind may ju&s;tly be
deemed more ra&s;h, precipitate, and dogmatical, than
even the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t affirmative philo&s;ophy,
which has ever attempted to impo&s;e its crude dictates
and principles on mankind.</P>
<P>WHAT tho' the&s;e rea&s;onings concerning human na|ture
&s;eem ab&s;tract, and of difficult comprehen&s;ion?
This affords no pre&s;umption of their fal&s;hood. On
the contrary, it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible, that what has hi|therto
e&s;caped &s;o many wi&s;e and profound philo&s;o|phers
can be very obvious and ea&s;y. And whatever
pains the&s;e re&s;earches may co&s;t us, we may think our|&s;elves
<PB N="18" REF="21">
&s;ufficiently rewarded, not only in point of pro|fit
but of plea&s;ure, if, by that means, we can make
any addition to our &s;tock of knowledge, in &s;ubjects
of &s;uch un&s;peakable importance.</P>
<P>BUT as, after all, the ab&s;tractedne&s;s of the&s;e &s;pecu|lations
is no recommendation, but rather a di&s;advan|tage
to them, and as this difficulty may perhaps be
&s;urmounted by care and art, and the avoiding all un|nece&s;&s;ary
detail, we have, in the following inquiry,
attempted to throw &s;ome light upon &s;ubjects, from
which uncertainty has hitherto deterred the wi&s;e, and
ob&s;curity the ignorant. Happy, if we can unite the
boundaries of the different &s;pecies of philo&s;ophy, by
reconciling profound inquiry with clearne&s;s, and truth
with novelty! And &s;till more happy, if, rea&s;oning in
this ea&s;y manner, we can undermine the foundations
of an ab&s;tru&s;e philo&s;ophy, which &s;eems to have &s;erved
hitherto only as a &s;helter to &s;uper&s;ition, and a cover to
ab&s;urdity and error!</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the ORIGIN of IDEAS.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY one will readily allow, that there is a
con&s;iderable difference between the perceptions
of the mind, when a man feels the pain of exce&s;&s;ive
heat, or the plea&s;ure of moderate warmth, and when
he afterwards recalls to his memory this &s;en&s;ation, or
anticipates it by his imagination. The&s;e faculties
may mimic or copy the perceptions of the &s;en&s;es; but
they never can reach entirely the force and vivacity of
the original &s;entiment. The utmo&s;t we &s;ay of them,
even when they operate with greate&s;t vigour, is,
that they repre&s;ent their object in &s;o lively a man|ner,
that we could <HI>almo&s;t</HI> &s;ay we feel or &s;ee it: But
except the mind be di&s;ordered by di&s;ea&s;e or madne&s;s,
they never can arrive at &s;uch a pitch of vivacity, as
to render the&s;e perceptions altogether undi&s;tingui&s;h|able.
All the colours of poetry, however &s;plendid,
can never paint natural objects in &s;uch a manner as
to make the de&s;cription be taken for a real land&s;kip.
<PB N="20" REF="23">
The mo&s;t lively thought is &s;till inferior to the dulle&s;t
&s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>WE may ob&s;erve a like di&s;tinction to run thro' all
the other perceptions of the mind. A man, in a fit
of anger, is actuated in a very different manner from
one who only thinks of that emotion. If you tell
me, that any per&s;on is in love, I ea&s;ily under&s;tand
your meaning, and form a ju&s;t conception of his &s;itu|ation;
but never can mi&s;take that conception for the
real di&s;orders and agitations of the pa&s;&s;ion. When
we refiect on our paft &s;entiments and affections, our
thought is a faithful mirror, and copies its objects
truly; but the colours which it employs are faint and
dull, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e in which our original
perceptions were clothed. It requires no nice di&s;|cernment
nor metaphy&s;ical head to mark the di&s;tinc|tion
between them.</P>
<P>HERE therefore we may divide all the perceptions
of the mind into two cla&s;&s;es or &s;pecies, which are
di&s;tingui&s;hed by their different degrees of force and
vivacity. The le&s;s forcible and lively are commonly
denominated THOUGHTS or IDEAS. The other &s;pe|cies
want a name in our language, and in mo&s;t others;
I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e it was not requi&s;ite for any, but
philo&s;ophical purpo&s;es, to rank them under a general
term or appellation. Let us, therefore, u&s;e a little
freedom, and call them IMPRESSIONS; employing
<PB N="21" REF="24">
that word in a &s;en&s;e &s;omewhat different from the u&s;ual.
By the term <HI>impre&s;&s;ion,</HI> then, I mean all our more
lively perceptions, when we hear, or &s;ee, or feel, or
love, or hate, or de&s;ire, or will. And impre&s;&s;ions
are di&s;tingui&s;hed from ideas, which are the le&s;s lively
perceptions of which we are con&s;cious, when we re|flect
on any of tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations or movements above
mentioned.</P>
<P>NOTHING, at fir&s;t view, may &s;eem more unbounded
than the thought of man, which not only e&s;capes all
human power and authority, but is not even re&s;trained
within the limits of nature and reality. To form
mon&s;ters, and join incongruous &s;hapes and appear|ances,
co&s;ts no more trouble than to conceive the
mo&s;t natural and familiar objects. And while the
body is confined to one planet, along which it creeps
with pain and difficulty; the thought can in an in|&s;tant
tran&s;port us into the mo&s;t di&s;tant regions of the
univer&s;e; or even beyond the univer&s;e, into the un|bounded
chaos, where nature is &s;uppo&s;ed to lie in
total confu&s;ion. What never was &s;een, nor heard of,
may yet be conceived; nor is any thing beyond the
power of thought, except what implies an ab&s;olute
contradiction.</P>
<P>BUT tho' thought &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s this unbounded
liberty, we &s;hall find, upon a nearer examination,
that it is really confined within very narrow limits,
and that all this creative power of the mind amounts
<PB N="22" REF="25">
to no more than the compounding, tran&s;po&s;ing, aug|menting,
or dimini&s;hing the materials afforded us by
the &s;en&s;es and experience. When we think of a
golden mountain, we only join two con&s;i&s;tent ideas,
<HI>gold,</HI> and <HI>mountain,</HI> with which we were formerly ac|quainted.
A virtuous hor&s;e we can conceive; be|cau&s;e,
from our own feeling, we can conceive virtue,
and this we may unite to the figure and &s;hape of a
hor&s;e, which is an animal familiar to us. In &s;hort,
all the materials of thinking are derived either from
our outward or inward &s;entiment: The mixture and
compo&s;ition of the&s;e belongs alone to the mind and
will. Or, to expre&s;s my&s;elf in philo&s;ophical lan|guage,
all our ideas or more feeble perceptions are
copies of our impre&s;&s;ions or more lively ones.</P>
<P>To prove this, the two following arguments will,
I hope, be &s;ufficient. Fir&s;t, When we analy&s;e our
thoughts or ideas, however compounded or &s;ublime,
we always find, that they re&s;olve them&s;elves into &s;uch
&s;imple ideas as were copied from a precedent feeling
or &s;entiment. Even tho&s;e ideas, which, at fir&s;t view,
&s;eem the mo&s;t wide of this origin, are found, upon
a narrower &s;crutiny, to be derived from it. The idea
of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wi&s;e,
and good Being, ari&s;es from reflecting on the opera|tions
of our own mind, and augmenting, without li|mit,
tho&s;e qualities of goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom. We
may pro&s;ecute this enquiry to what length we plea&s;e;
<PB N="23" REF="26">
where we &s;hall always find, that every idea we exa|mine
is copied from a &s;imilar impre&s;&s;ion. Tho&s;e who
would a&s;&s;ert, that this po&s;ition is not ab&s;olutely uni|ver&s;al
and without exception, have only one, and that
an ea&s;y method of refuting it; by producing that idea,
which, in their opinion, is not derived from this
&s;ource. It will then be incumbent on us, if we would
maintain our doctrine, to produce the impre&s;&s;ion or
lively perception, which corre&s;ponds to it.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. If it happen, from a defect of the
organ, that a man is not &s;u&s;ceptible of any &s;pecies
of &s;en&s;ation, we always find, that he is as little &s;u&s;|ceptible
of the corre&s;pondent ideas. A blind man
can form no notion of colours; a deaf man of &s;ounds.
Re&s;tore either of them that &s;en&s;e, in which he is de|ficient;
by opening this new inlet for his &s;en&s;ations,
you al&s;o open an inlet for the ideas, and he finds no
difficulty of conceiving the&s;e objects. The ca&s;e is the
fame, if the object, proper for exciting any &s;en&s;ation,
has never been applied to the organ. A LAPLANDER
or NEGROE has no notion of the reli&s;h of wine.
And tho' there are few or no in&s;tances of a like defi|ciency
in the mind, where a per&s;on has never felt or
is wholly incapable of a &s;entiment or pa&s;&s;ion, that be|longs
to his &s;pecies; yet we find the &s;ame ob&s;ervation
to take place in a le&s;s degree. A man of mild man|ners
can form no notion of inveterate revenge or
cruelty; nor can a &s;elfi&s;h heart ea&s;ily conceive the
<PB N="24" REF="27">
heights of friend&s;hip and genero&s;ity. 'Tis readily al|lowed,
that other beings may po&s;&s;e&s;s many &s;en&s;es, of
which we can have no conception: becau&s;e the ideas
of them have never been introduced to us in the only
manner by which an idea can have acce&s;s to the mind,
<HI>viz.</HI> by the actual feeling and &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>THERE is, however, one contradictory phaenome|non,
which may prove, that 'tis not ab&s;olutely im|po&s;&s;ible
for ideas to go before their corre&s;pondent im|pre&s;&s;ions.
I believe it will readily be allowed, that
the &s;everal di&s;tinct ideas of colours, which enter by
the eyes, or tho&s;e of &s;ounds, which are conveyed by
the hearing, are really different from each other; tho',
at the &s;ame time, re&s;embling. Now if this be true
of different colours, it mu&s;t be no le&s;s &s;o, of the dif|ferent
&s;hades of the &s;ame colour; and each &s;hade pro|duces
a di&s;tinct idea, independent of the re&s;t. For if
this &s;hould be denied, 'tis po&s;&s;ible, by the continual
gradation of &s;hades, to run a colour in&s;en&s;ibly into
what is mo&s;t remote from it; and if you will not al|low
any of the means to be different, you cannot,
without ab&s;urdity, deny the extremes to be the &s;ame.
Suppo&s;e, therefore, a per&s;on to have enjoyed his &s;ight
for thirty years, and to have become perfectly well
acquainted with colours of all kinds, except one par|ticular
&s;hade of blue, for in&s;tance, which it never has
been his fortune to meet with. Let all the different
&s;hades of that colour, except that &s;ingle one, be
<PB N="25" REF="28">
placed before him, de&s;cending gradually from the
deepe&s;t to the lighte&s;t; 'tis plain, that he will per|ceive
a blank, where that &s;hade is wanting, and will
be &s;en&s;ible, that there is a greater di&s;tance in that
place betwixt the contiguous colours than in any other. Now
I a&s;k, whether 'tis po&s;&s;ible for him, from his own
imagination, to &s;upply this deficiency, and rai&s;e up
to him&s;elf the idea of that particular &s;hade, tho' it
had never been conveyed to him by his &s;en&s;es? I
believe there are few but will be of opinion that he
can; and this may &s;erve as a proof, that the &s;imple
ideas are not always, in every in&s;tance, derived from
the corre&s;pondent impre&s;&s;ions; tho' this in&s;tance is
&s;o &s;ingular, that 'tis &s;carce worth our ob&s;erving, and
does not merit, that for it alone, we &s;hould alter our
general maxim.</P>
<P>HERE, therefore, is a propo&s;ition, which not only
&s;eems, in it&s;elf, &s;imple and intelligible; but if a pro|per
u&s;e were made of it, might render every di&s;pute
equally intelligible, and bani&s;h all that jargon, which
has &s;o long taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of metaphy&s;ical rea&s;on|ings,
and drawn &s;uch di&s;grace upon them. All ideas,
e&s;pecially ab&s;tract ones, are naturally faint and ob|&s;cure;
the mind has but a &s;lender hold of them:
They are apt to be confounded with other re&s;embling
ideas; and when we have often employed any term,
tho' without a di&s;tinct meaning, we are apt to ima|gine
that it has a determinate idea, annexed to it.
<PB N="26" REF="29">
On the contrary, all impre&s;&s;ions, that is, all &s;en&s;ations,
either outward or inward, are &s;trong and &s;en&s;ible:
The limits between them are more exactly deter|mined:
Nor is it ea&s;y to fall into any error or mi&s;take
with regard to them. When we entertain therefore
any &s;u&s;picion, that a philo&s;ophical term is employed
without any meaning or idea (as is but too frequent)
we need but enquire, <HI>from what impre&s;&s;ion is that
&s;uppo&s;ed idea derived?</HI> And if it be impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;|&s;ign
any, this will &s;erve to confirm our &s;u&s;picion.
By bringing ideas into &s;o clear a light, we may rea|&s;onably
hope to remove all di&s;pute, which may ari&s;e,
concerning their nature and reality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>'Tis probable, that no more was meant by tho&s;e, who de|nied innate ideas, than that all ideas were copies of our impre&s;|&s;ions; tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the terms which they em|ployed were not cho&s;en with &s;uch caution, nor &s;o exactly defined as to prevent all mi&s;takes about their doctrine. For what is meant by <HI>innate?</HI> If innate be equivalent to natural, then all the perceptions and ideas of the mind mu&s;t be allowed to be in|nate or natural, in whatever &s;en&s;e we take the latter word, whether in oppo&s;ition to what is uncommon, artificial, or mira|culous. If by innate be meant, cotemporary to our birth, the di&s;pute &s;eems to be frivolous; nor is it worth while to enquire at what time thinking begins, whether before, at, or after our birth. Again, the word, <HI>idea,</HI> &s;eems to be commonly taken in a very loo&s;e &s;en&s;e, even by Mr. LOCKE him&s;elf, as &s;tanding for any of our perceptions, our &s;en&s;ations and pa&s;&s;ions, as well as thoughts. Now in this &s;en&s;e, I &s;hould de&s;ire to know, what can be meant by a&s;&s;erting, that &s;elf-love, or re&s;entment of injuries, or the pa&s;&s;ion between the &s;exes is, not innate?</P>
<P>But admitting the&s;e terms, <HI>impre&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>ideas,</HI> in the &s;en&s;e above explained, and under&s;tanding by <HI>innate</HI> what is original or copied from no precedent perception, then may we a&s;&s;ert, that all our impre&s;&s;ions are innate, and our ideas not innate.</P>
<P>To be ingenuous, I mu&s;t own it to be my opinion, that Mr. LOCKE was betrayed into this que&s;tion by the &s;choolmen, who making u&s;e of undefined terms, draw out their di&s;putes to a te|dious length, without ever touching the point in que&s;tion. A like ambiguity and circumlocution &s;eem to run thro' all that great philo&s;opher's rea&s;onings on this &s;ubject.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the ASSOCIATION of IDEAS.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS evident, that there is a principle of con|nexion
between the different thoughts or ideas
of the mind, and that in their appearance to the me|mory
or imagination, they introduce each other with
a certain degree of method and regularity. In our
more &s;erious thinking or di&s;cour&s;e, this is &s;o ob&s;erv|able,
that any particular thought, which breaks in
upon this regular tract or chain of ideas, is immedi|ately
remarked and rejected. And even in our wilde&s;t
and mo&s;t wandering reveries, nay in our very dreams,
we &s;hall find, if we reflect, that the imagination ran
not altogether at adventures, but that there was &s;till a
connexion upheld among the different ideas, which
&s;ucceeded each other. Were the loo&s;e&s;t and free&s;t
conver&s;ation to be tran&s;cribed, there would immedi|ately
be ob&s;erved &s;omething, which connected it in
all its tran&s;itions. Or where this is wanting, the per|&s;on,
who broke the thread of di&s;cour&s;e, might &s;till
<PB N="30" REF="32">
inform you, that there had &s;ecretly revolved in his
mind a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of thought, which had gradually led
him away from the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation. Among
the languages of different nations, even where we
cannot &s;u&s;pect the lea&s;t connexion or communication,
'tis found, that the words, expre&s;&s;ive of ideas, the
mo&s;t compounded, do yet nearly corre&s;pond to each
other: A certain proof, that the &s;imple ideas, com|prehended
in the compound ones, were bound toge|ther
by &s;ome univer&s;al principle, which had an equal
influence on all mankind.</P>
<P>THO' it be too obvious to e&s;cape ob&s;ervation, that
different ideas are connected together; I do not find,
that any philo&s;opher has attempted to enumerate or
cla&s;s all the principles of a&s;&s;ociation; a &s;ubject, how|ever,
that &s;eems very worthy of curio&s;ity. To me,
there appear to be only three principles of connexion
among ideas, <HI>viz. Re&s;emblance, Contiguity</HI> in time or
place, and <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> or <HI>Effect.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the&s;e principles &s;erve to connect ideas will
not, I believe, be much doubted. A picture natu|rally
leads our thoughts to the original<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Re&s;emblance.</NOTE>: The men|tion
of one apartment in a building naturally intro|duces
an enquiry or di&s;cour&s;e concerning the others<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Contiguity.</NOTE>:
And if we think of a wound, we can &s;carce forbear
<PB N="31" REF="33">
reflecting on the pain which follows it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cau&s;e and Effect.</NOTE>. But that
this enumeration is compleat, and that there are no
other principles of a&s;&s;ociation, except the&s;e, may be
difficult to prove to the &s;atisfaction of the reader, or
even to a man's own &s;atisfaction. All we can do, in
&s;uch ca&s;es, is to run over &s;everal in&s;tances, and exa|mine
carefully the principle, which binds the different
thoughts to each other, never &s;topping till we render
the principle as general as po&s;&s;ible. The more in|&s;tances
we examine, and the more care we employ,
the more a&s;&s;urance &s;hall we acquire, that the enume|ration,
which we form from the whole, is compleat
and entire. In&s;tead of entering into a detail of this
kind, which would lead into many u&s;ele&s;s &s;ubtilties,
we &s;hall con&s;ider &s;ome of the effects of this connexion
upon the pa&s;&s;ions and imagination; where we may
open a field of &s;peculation more entertaining, and per|haps
more in&s;tructive, than the other.</P>
<P>As man is rea&s;onable being, and is continually in
pur&s;uit of happine&s;s, which he hopes to attain by
the gratification of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion or affection, he &s;el|dom
acts or &s;peaks or thinks without a purpo&s;e and
intention. He has &s;till &s;ome object in view; and
however improper the means may &s;ometimes be,
which he chu&s;es for the attainment of his end, he
never lo&s;es view of an end, nor will he &s;o much as
<PB N="32" REF="34">
throw away his thoughts or reflections, where he hopes
not to reap any &s;atisfaction from them.</P>
<P>IN all compo&s;itions of genius, therefore, 'tis requi|&s;ite
that the writer have &s;ome plan or object; and
tho' he may be hurried from this plan by the vehe|mence
of thought, as in an ode, or drop it carele&s;ly,
as in an epi&s;tle or e&s;&s;ay, there mu&s;t appear &s;ome aim
or intention, in his fir&s;t &s;etting out, if not in the
compo&s;ition of the whole work. A production with|out
a de&s;ign would re&s;emble more the raving of a
madman, than the &s;ober efforts of genius and learn|ing.</P>
<P>As
this rule admits of no exception, it follows,
that in narrative compo&s;itions, the events or actions,
which the writer relates, mu&s;t be connected together,
by &s;ome bond or tye: They mu&s;t be related to each
other in the imagination, and form a kind of <HI>Unity,</HI>
which may bring them under one plan or view, and
which may be the object or end of the writer in his
fir&s;t undertaking.</P>
<P>THIS connecting principle among the &s;everal events,
which form the &s;ubject of a poem or hi&s;tory, may by
very different, according to the different de&s;igns of
the poet or hi&s;torian. OVID has formed his plan up|on
the connecting principle or re&s;emblance. Every
&s;abulous transformation, produced by the miraculous
<PB N="33" REF="35">
power of the gods, falls within the compa&s;s of his
work. There needs but this one circum&s;tance in any
event to bring it under his original plan or intention.</P>
<P>AN annali&s;t or hi&s;torian, who &s;hould undertake to
write the hi&s;tory of EUROPE during any century,
would be influenced by the connexion of contiguity
in time and place. All events, which happen in that
portion of &s;pace, and period of time, are compre|hended
in his de&s;ign, tho' in other re&s;pects different
and unconnected. They have &s;till a &s;pecies of unity,
amid&s;t all their diver&s;ity.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;pecies of connexion among
the different events, which enter into any narrative
compo&s;ition, is that of cau&s;e and effect: while the
hi&s;torian traces the &s;eries of actions according to their
natural order, remounts to their &s;ecret &s;prings and
principles, and delineates their mo&s;t remote con&s;e|quences.
He chu&s;es for his &s;ubject a certain portion
of that great chain of events, which compo&s;e the hi&s;|tory
of mankind: Each link in this chain he endea|vours
to touch in his narration: Sometimes unavoid|able
ignorance renders all his attempts fruitle&s;s: Some|times,
he &s;upplies by conjecture what is wanting in
knowledge: And always, he is &s;en&s;ible, that the more
unbroken the chain is, which he pre&s;ents to his read|ers,
the more perfect is his production. He &s;ees,
that the knowledge of cau&s;es is not only the mo&s;t &s;a|tisfactory;
this relation or connexion being the &s;trong|e&s;t
<PB N="34" REF="36">
of all others; but al&s;o the mo&s;t in&s;tructive; &s;ince
it is by this knowlege alone, we are enabled to con|troul
events, and govern futurity.</P>
<P>HERE therefore we may attain &s;ome notion of that
<HI>Unity</HI> of <HI>Action,</HI> about which all critics, after ARI|STOTLE,
have talked &s;o much: Perhaps, to little
purpo&s;e, while they directed not their ta&s;te or &s;enti|ment
by the accuracy of philo&s;ophy. It appears,
that in all productions, as well as in the epic and
tragic, there is a certain unity required, and that, on
no occa&s;ion, can our thoughts be allowed to run at
adventures, if we would produce a work, which will
give any la&s;ting entertainment to mankind. It ap|pears
al&s;o, that even a biographer, who &s;hould write
the life of ACHILLES, would connect the events, by
&s;hewing their mutual dependence and relation, as
much as a poet, who &s;hould make the anger of that
hero, the &s;ubject of his narration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contrary to ARISTOTLE, <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>. Not only in any
limited portion of life, a man's actions have a depen|dance
on each other, but al&s;o during the whole pe|riod
of his duration, from the cradle to the grave;
nor is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;trike off one link, however mi|nute,
in this regular chain, without affecting the
<PB N="35" REF="37">
whole &s;eries of events, which follow. The unity of
action, therefore, which is to be found in biography
or hi&s;tory, differs from that of epic poetry, not in
kind, but in degree. In epic poetry, the connexion
among the events is more clo&s;e and &s;en&s;ible: The
narration is not carried on thro' &s;uch a length of
time: And the actors ha&s;ten to &s;ome remarkable pe|riod,
which &s;atisfies the curio&s;ity of the reader. This
conduct of the epic poet depends on that particular
&s;ituation of the <HI>Imagination</HI> and of the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> which
is &s;uppo&s;ed in that production. The imagination,
both of writer and reader, is more enlivened, and the
pa&s;&s;ions more enflamed than in hi&s;tory, biography,
or any &s;pecies of narration, which confine them&s;elves
to &s;trict truth and reality. Let us con&s;ider the effect
of the&s;e two circum&s;tances, an enlivened imagination
and enflamed pa&s;&s;ions, circum&s;tances, which belong
to poetry, e&s;pecially the epic kind, above any other
&s;pecies of compo&s;ition; and let us examine the rea&s;on
why they require a &s;tricter and clo&s;er unity in the
fable.</P>
<P>FIRST. All poetry, being a &s;pecies of painting,
approaches us nearer to the objects than any other
&s;pecies of narration, throws a &s;tronger light upon
them, and delineates more di&s;tinctly tho&s;e minute
circum&s;tances, which, tho' to the hi&s;torian they &s;eem
&s;uper&s;luous, &s;erve mightily to enliven the imagery,
and gratify the fancy. If it be not nece&s;&s;ary, as in
<PB N="36" REF="38">
the <HI>Iliad,</HI> to inform us each time the hero buckles his
&s;hoes, and ties his garters, it will be requi&s;ite, per|haps,
to enter into a greater detail than in the HEN|RIADE;
where the events are run over with &s;uch ra|pidity,
that we &s;carce have lei&s;ure to become acquaint|ed
with the &s;cene or action. Were a poet, therefore,
to comprehend in his &s;ubject any great compa&s;s of
time or &s;eries of events, and trace up the death of
HECTOR to its remote cau&s;es, in the rape of HELEN,
or the judgment of PARIS, he mu&s;t draw out his
poem to an immea&s;urable length, in order to fill this
large canvas with ju&s;t painting and imagery. The
reader's imagination, enflamed with &s;uch a &s;eries of
poetical de&s;criptions, and his pa&s;&s;ions, agitated by a
continual &s;ympathy with the actors, mu&s;t flag long
before the period of the narration, and mu&s;t &s;ink into
la&s;&s;itude and di&s;gu&s;t, from the repeated violence of
the &s;ame movements.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. That an epic poet mu&s;t not trace the
cau&s;es to any great di&s;tance, will farther appear, if
we con&s;ider another rea&s;on, which is drawn from a
property of the pa&s;&s;ions &s;till more remarkable and &s;in|gular.
'Tis evident, that in a ju&s;t compo&s;ition, all
the affections, excited by the different events, de&s;cribed
and repre&s;ented, add mutual force to each other; and
that while the heroes are all engaged in one common
&s;cene, and each action is &s;trongly connected with the
whole, the concern is continually awake, and the pa&s;&s;|ions
<PB N="37" REF="39">
make an ea&s;y tran&s;ition from one object to ano|ther.
The &s;trong connection of the events, as it fa|cilitates
the pa&s;&s;age of the thought or imagination
from one to another, facilitates al&s;o the transfu&s;ion of
the pa&s;&s;ions, and pre&s;erves the affections &s;till in the
&s;ame channel and direction. Our &s;ympathy and con|cern
for EVE prepares the way for a like &s;ympathy
with ADAM: The affection is pre&s;erved almo&s;t entire
in the tran&s;ition; and the mind &s;eizes immediately
the new object as &s;trongly related to that which for|merly
engaged its attention. But were the poet to
make a total digre&s;&s;ion from his &s;ubject, and intro|duce
a new actor, no way connected with the per|&s;onages,
the imagination, feeling a breach in the tran|&s;ition,
would enter coldly into the new &s;cene; would
kindle by flow degrees; and in returning to the main
&s;ubject of the poem, would pa&s;s, as it were, upon
foreign ground, and have its concern to excite anew,
in order to take party with the principal actors. The
&s;ame inconvenience follows in a le&s;s degree, where
the poet traces his events to too great a di&s;tance, and
binds together actions, which tho' not entirely di&s;|joined,
have not &s;o &s;trong a connexion as is requi&s;ite
to forward the tran&s;ition of the pa&s;&s;ions. Hence ari&s;es
the artifice of the oblique narration, employed in the
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> AND <HI>Aeneid;</HI> where the hero is introduced, at
fir&s;t, near the period of his de&s;igns, and afterwards
&s;hows us, as it were in per&s;pective, the more di&s;tant
<PB N="38" REF="40">
events and cau&s;es. By this means, the reader's curi|o&s;ity
is immediately excited: The events follow with
rapidity, and in a very clo&s;e connexion: And the
concern is pre&s;erved alive, and, by means of the near
relation of the objects, continually increa&s;es, from the
beginning to the end of the narration.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame rule takes place in dramatic poetry;
nor is it ever permitted, in a regular compo&s;ition, to
introduce an actor, who has no connexion, or but a
&s;mall one, with the principal per&s;onages of the fable.
The &s;pectator's concern mu&s;t not be diverted by any
&s;cenes, di&s;joined and &s;eparated from the re&s;t. This
breaks the cour&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ions, and prevents that
communication of the &s;everal emotions, by which one
&s;cene adds force to another, and transfu&s;es the pity
and terror, which it excites, upon each &s;ucceeding
&s;cene, 'till the whole produces that rapidity of move|ment,
which is peculiar to the theatre. How mu&s;t
it extingui&s;h this warmth of affection to be enter|tained,
on a &s;udden, with a new action and new per|&s;onages,
no way related to the former; to find &s;o
&s;en&s;ible a breach or vacuity in the cour&s;e of the pa&s;|&s;ions,
by means of this breach in the connexion of
ideas; and in&s;tead of carrying the &s;ympathy of one
&s;cene into the following, to be obliged every moment,
to excite a new concern, and take party in a new
&s;cene of action?</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41">
BUT tho' this rule of unity of action be common
to dramatic and epic poetry; we may &s;till ob&s;erve a
difference between them, which may, perhaps, de|&s;erve
our attention. In both the&s;e &s;pecies of compo|&s;ition,
'tis requi&s;ite that the action be one and &s;imple,
in order to pre&s;erve the concern or &s;ympathy entire
and undiverted: But in epic or narrative poetry, this
rule is al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed upon another foundation, <HI>viz.</HI>
the nece&s;&s;ity, that is incumbent on every writer, to
form &s;ome plan or de&s;ign, before he enter on any
di&s;cour&s;e or narration, and to comprehend his &s;ubject
in &s;ome general a&s;pect or united view, which may
be the con&s;tant object of his attention. As the author
is entirely lo&s;t in dramatic compo&s;itions, and the &s;pec|tator
&s;uppo&s;es him&s;elf to be really pre&s;ent at the ac|tions
repre&s;ented; this rea&s;on has no place with re|gard
to the &s;tage; but any dialogue or conver&s;ation
may be introduced, which, without improbability,
might have pa&s;&s;ed in that determinate portion of &s;pace,
repre&s;ented by the theatre. Hence in all our ENG|LISH
comedies, even tho&s;e of CONGREVE, the unity
of action is never &s;trictly ob&s;erved; but the poet
thinks is &s;ufficient, if his per&s;onages be any way re|lated
to each other, by blood, or by living in the
&s;ame family; and he afterwards introduces them in
particular &s;cenes, where they di&s;play their humours and
characters, without much forwarding the main action.
The double plots of TERENCE are licences of the
<PB N="40" REF="42">
&s;ame kind; but in a le&s;s degree. And tho' this con|duct
be not perfectly regular, it is not wholly un&s;uit|able
to the nature of comedy, where the movements
and pa&s;&s;ions are not rai&s;ed to &s;uch a height as in tra|gedy;
at the &s;ame time, that the fiction or repre&s;en|tation
palliates, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;uch licences. In
a narrative poem, the fir&s;t propo&s;ition or de&s;ign con|fines
the author to one &s;ubject; and any digre&s;&s;ions
of this nature would, at fir&s;t view, be rejected, as
ab&s;urd and mon&s;trous. Neither BOCCACE, LA FON|TAINE,
nor any author of that kind, tho' plea&s;antry
be their chief object, have ever indulged them.</P>
<P>To return to the compari&s;on of hi&s;tory and epic
poetry, we may conclude, from the foregoing rea|&s;onings,
that as a certain unity is requi&s;ite in all pro|ductions,
it cannot be wanting to hi&s;tory more than
to any other; that in hi&s;tory, the connexion among
the &s;everal events, which unites them into one body,
is the relation of cau&s;e and effect, the &s;ame which
takes place in epic poetry; and that in the latter com|po&s;ition,
this connexion is only required to be clo&s;er
and more &s;en&s;ible, on account of the lively imagina|tion
and &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, which mu&s;t be touched by
the poet in his narration. The PELEPONNESIAN
war is a proper &s;ubject for hi&s;tory, the &s;iege of
ATHENS for an epic poem, and the death of ALCI|BIADES
for a tragedy.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="43">
As the difference, therefore, between hi&s;tory and
epic poetry con&s;i&s;ts only in the degrees of connexion,
which bind together tho&s;e &s;everal events, of which
their &s;ubject is compo&s;ed, 'twill be difficult, if not
impo&s;&s;ible, by words, to determine exactly the bounds
which &s;eparate them from each other. That is a
matter of ta&s;te more than of rea&s;oning; and perhaps,
this unity may often be di&s;covered in a &s;ubject, where,
at fir&s;t view, and from an ab&s;tract con&s;ideration, we
&s;hould lea&s;t expect to find it.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that HOMER, in the cour&s;e of his
narration, exceeds the fir&s;t propo&s;ition of his &s;ubject;
and that the anger of ACHILLES, which cau&s;ed the
death of HECTOR, is not the &s;ame with that which
produced &s;o many ills to the GREEKS. But the &s;trong
connexion between tho&s;e two movements, the quick
tran&s;ition from one to another, the contra&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contra&s;t of contrariety is a connexion among ideas, which may, perhaps, be con&s;idered as a mixture of cau&s;ation and re|&s;emblance. Where two objects are contrary, the one de&s;troys the other, i. e. is the cau&s;e of its annihilation, and the idea of the annihilation of an object implies the idea of its former ex|i&s;tence.</NOTE> between
the effects of concord and di&s;cord among the princes,
and the natural curio&s;ity which we have to &s;ee A|CHILLES
in action, after &s;uch long repo&s;e; all the&s;e
cau&s;es carry on the reader, and produce a &s;ufficient
unity in the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="44">
IT may be objected to MILTON, that he has traced
up his cau&s;es to too great a di&s;tance, and that the re|bellion
of the angles produces the fall of man by a
train of events, which is both very long and very ca|&s;ual.
Not to mention that the creation of the world,
which he has related at length, is no more the cau&s;e
of that cata&s;trophe, than of the battle of PHARSALIA,
or any other event, that has ever happened. But if
we con&s;ider, on the other hand, that all the&s;e events,
the rebellion of the angels, the creation of the world,
and the fall of man, <HI>re&s;emble</HI> each other, in being
miraculous and out of the common cour&s;e of nature;
that they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>contiguous</HI> in time;
and that being detached from all other events, and
being the only original facts, which revelation di&s;|covers,
they &s;trike the eye at once, and naturally re|call
each other to the thought or imagination: If we
con&s;ider all the&s;e circum&s;tances, I &s;ay, we &s;hall find,
that the&s;e parts of the action have a &s;ufficient unity
to make them be comprehended in one fable or nar|ration.
To which we may add, that the rebellion of
the angels and the fall of man have a peculiar re|&s;emblance,
as being counterparts to each other, and
pre&s;enting to the reader the &s;ame moral, of obedi|ence
to our Creator.</P>
<P>THESE loo&s;e hints I have thrown together, in or|der
to excite the curio&s;ity of philo&s;ophers, and beget
a &s;u&s;picion at lea&s;t, if not a full per&s;ua&s;ion, that this
<PB N="43" REF="45">
&s;ubject is very copious, and that many operations of
the human mind depend on the connexion or a&s;&s;ocia|tion
of ideas, which is here explained. Particularly,
the &s;ympathy between the pa&s;&s;ions and imagination
will, perhaps, appear remarkable; while we ob&s;erve
that the affections, excited by one object, pa&s;s ea&s;ily
to another connected with it; but transfu&s;e them|&s;elves
with difficulty, or not at all, along different
objects, which have no manner of connexion toge|ther.
By introducing, into any compo&s;ition, per|&s;onages
and actions, foreign to each other, an injudi|cious
author lo&s;es that communication of emotions,
by which alone he can intere&s;t the heart, and rai&s;e
the pa&s;&s;ions to their proper height and period. The
full explication of this principle and all its con&s;e|quences
would lead us into rea&s;onings too profound
and too copious for this enquiry. 'Tis &s;ufficient, at
pre&s;ent, to have e&s;tabli&s;hed this conclu&s;ion, that the
three connecting principles of all ideas are the rela|tions
of <HI>Re&s;emblance, Contiguity,</HI> and <HI>Cau&s;ation.</HI></P>

<P>ALL the objects of human rea&s;on or enquiry may
naturally be divided into two kinds, <HI>viz. Re|lations
of Ideas</HI> and <HI>Matters of Fact.</HI> Of the fir&s;t kind
are the &s;ciences of Geometry, Algebra, and Arith|metic;
and in &s;hort, every affirmation, which is either
intuitively or demon&s;tratively certain. <HI>That the &s;quare
of the hypothenu&s;e is equal to the &s;quares of the two &s;ides,</HI>
is a propo&s;ition, which expre&s;&s;es a relation between
the&s;e figures. <HI>That three times five is equal to the half
of thirty,</HI> expre&s;&s;es a relation between the&s;e numbers.
Propo&s;itions of this kind are di&s;coverable by the mere
operation of thought, without dependence on what is
any where exi&s;tent in the univer&s;e. Tho' there never
were a circle or triangle in nature, the truths demon|&s;trated
by EUCLID, would for ever retain their cer|tainty
and evidence.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47">
MATTERS of fact, which are the &s;econd objects of
human rea&s;on, are not a&s;certained int the &s;ame man|ner;
nor is our evidence of their truth, however
great, of a like nature with the foregoing. The con|trary
of every matter of fact is &s;till po&s;&s;ible; be|cau&s;e
it can never imply a contradiction, and is con|ceived
by the mind with equal facility and di&s;tinct|ne&s;s,
as if ever &s;o conformable to reality. <HI>That the
&s;un will not ri&s;e to-morrow</HI> is no le&s;s intelligible a
propo&s;ition, and implies no more contradiction, than
the affirmation, <HI>that it will ri&s;e.</HI> We &s;hould in vain,
therefore, attempt to demon&s;trate its fal&s;hood. Were
it demon&s;tratively fal&s;e, it would imply a contradic|tion,
and could never be di&s;tinctly conceived by the
mind.</P>
<P>IT may, therefore, be a &s;ubject worthy curio&s;ity,
to enquire what is the nature of that evidence, which
a&s;&s;ures us of any real exi&s;tence and matter of fact,
beyond the pre&s;ent te&s;timony of our &s;en&s;es, or the re|cords
of our memory. This part of philo&s;ophy, 'tis
ob&s;ervable, has been little cultivated, either by the
ancients or moderns; and therefore our doubts and er|rors,
in the pro&s;ecution of &s;o important an enquiry,
may be the more excu&s;able, while we march thro'
&s;uch difficult paths, without any guide or direction.
They may even prove u&s;eful, by exciting curio&s;ity,
and de&s;troying that implicit faith and &s;ecurity, which
is the bane of all rea&s;oning and free enquiry. The
<PB N="47" REF="48">
di&s;covery of defects in the common philo&s;ophy, if
any &s;uch there be, will not, I pre&s;ume, be a di&s;cou|ragement,
but rather an incitement, as is u&s;ual, to
attempt &s;omething more full and &s;atisfactory, than
has yet been propo&s;ed to the public.</P>
<P>ALL rea&s;onings concerning matter of fact &s;eem to
be founded in the relation of <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> and <HI>Effect.</HI> By
means of that relation alone can we go beyond the
evidence of our memory and &s;en&s;es. If you were to
a&s;k a man, why he believes any matter of fact, which
is ab&s;ent; for in&s;tance, that his friend is in the coun|try,
or in FRANCE; he would give you a rea&s;on;
and this rea&s;on would be &s;ome other fact; as a letter
received from him, or the knowlege of his former
re&s;olutions and primi&s;es. A man, finding a watch
or any other machine in a de&s;art i&s;land, would con|clude,
that there had once been men in that i&s;land.
All our rea&s;onings concerning fact are of the &s;ame
nature. And here 'tis con&s;tantly &s;uppo&s;ed, that there
is a connexion between the pre&s;ent fact and that in|ferred
from it. Were there nothing to bind them to|gether,
the inference would be entirely precarious.
The hearing of an articulate voice and rational di&s;|cour&s;e
in the dark a&s;&s;ures us of the pre&s;ence of &s;ome
per&s;on: Why? becau&s;e the&s;e are the effects of the
human make and fabric, and clo&s;ely connected with
it. If we anatomize all the other rea&s;onings of this
nature, we &s;hall find, that they are founded in the
<PB N="48" REF="49">
relation of cau&s;e and effect, and that this relation is
either near or remote, direct or collateral. Heat and
light are collateral effects of fire, and the one effect
may ju&s;tly be inferred from the other.</P>
<P>IF we would &s;atisfy our&s;elves, therefore, concern|ing
the nature of that evidence, which a&s;&s;ures us of
all matters of fact, we mu&s;t enquire how we arrive at
the knowlege of cau&s;e and effect.</P>
<P>I SHALL venture to affirm, as a general propo&s;ition,
which admits of no exception, that the knowlege of this
relation is not, in any in&s;tance, attained by rea&s;onings
<HI>&agrave; priori;</HI> but ari&s;es entirely from experience, when we
find, that any particular objects are con&s;tantly con|joined
with each other. Let an object be pre&s;ented
to a man of ever &s;o &s;trong natural rea&s;on and abilities;
if that object be entirely new to him, he will not be
able, by the mo&s;t accurate examination of its &s;en&s;ible
qualities, to di&s;cover any of its cau&s;es or effects.
ADAM, tho' his rational faculties be &s;uppo&s;ed, at the
very fir&s;t, entirely perfect, could not have inferred
from the fluidity and tran&s;parency of water, that it
would &s;uffocate him, or from the light and warmth of
fire, that it would con&s;ume him. No object ever di&s;|covers,
by the qualities which appear to the &s;en&s;es,
either the cau&s;es, which produced it, or the effects,
which will ari&s;e from it; nor can our rea&s;on, una&s;|&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="49" REF="50">
by experience, ever draw any inferences con|cerning
real exi&s;tence and matter of fact.</P>
<P>THIS propo&s;ition, <HI>that cau&s;e and effects are di&s;cover|able,
not by rea&s;on but by experience,</HI> will readily be
admitted with regard to &s;uch objects, as we remem|ber
to have been once altogether unknown to us;
&s;ince we mu&s;t be con&s;cious of the utter inability which
we then lay under of foretelling what would ari&s;e
from them. Pre&s;ent two &s;mooth pieces of marble to
a man, who has no tincture of natural philo&s;ophy;
he will never di&s;cover, that they will adhere together,
in &s;uch a manner as to require great force to &s;eparate
them in a direct line, while they make &s;o &s;mall a re|&s;i&s;tance
to a lateral pre&s;&s;ure. Such events, as bear
little analogy to the common cour&s;e of nature, are al&s;o
readily confe&s;&s;ed to be known only by experience; nor
does any man imagine that the explo&s;ion of gunpowder,
or the attraction of a load&s;tone could ever be di&s;co|vered
by arguments <HI>&agrave; priori.</HI> In like manner, when
an effect is &s;uppo&s;ed to depend upon an intricate ma|chinery
or &s;ecret &s;tructure of parts, we make no dif|ficulty
to attribute all our knowlege of it to experi|ence.
Who will a&s;&s;ert, that he can give the ultimate
rea&s;on, why milk or bread is proper nouri&s;hment for
a man, not for a lion or a tyger?</P>
<P>BUT the &s;ame truth may not appear, at fir&s;t &s;ight,
to have the &s;ame evidence with regard to events,
<PB N="50" REF="51">
which have become familiar to us from our fir&s;t ap|pearance
in the world, which bear a clo&s;e analogy to
the whole cour&s;e of nature, and which are &s;uppo&s;ed
to depend on the &s;imple qualities of objects, without
any &s;ecret &s;tructure of parts. We are apt to ima|gine,
that we could di&s;cover the&s;e effects, by the mere
operations of our rea&s;on, without experience. We
fancy, that, were we brought, on a &s;udden, into this
world, we could at fir&s;t have inferred, that one Bil|liard-ball
would communicate motion to another up|on
impul&s;e; and that we needed not to have waited
for the event, in order to pronounce with certainty
concerning it. Such is the influence of cu&s;tom, that,
where it is &s;tronge&s;t, it not only covers our natural
ignorance, but even conceals it&s;elf, and &s;eems not to
take place, merely becau&s;e it is found in the highe&s;t

<P>BUT to convince us, that all the laws of nature
and all the operations of bodies, without exception,
are known only by experience, the following reflec|tions,
may, perhaps, &s;uffice. Were any object pre|&s;ented
to us, and were we required to pronounce con|cerning
the effect, which will re&s;ult from it, without
con&s;ulting pa&s;t ob&s;ervation; after what manner, I be|&s;eech
you, mu&s;t the mind proceed in this operation?
It mu&s;t invent or imagine &s;ome event, which it a&s;cribes
to the object as its effect; and 'tis plain that this
invention mu&s;t be entirely arbitrary. The mind can
<PB N="51" REF="52">
never po&s;&s;ibly find the effect in the &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;e, by
the mo&s;t accurate &s;crutiny and examination. For the
effect is totally different from the cau&s;e, and con&s;e|quently
can never be di&s;covered in it. Motion in the
&s;econd Billiard-ball is a quite di&s;tinct event from mo|tion
in the fir&s;t; nor is there any thing in the one to
&s;ugge&s;t the &s;malle&s;t hint of the other. A &s;tone or
piece of metal rai&s;ed into the air, and left without
any &s;upport, immediately falls: But to con&s;ider the
matter <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> is there any thing we di&s;cover in this
&s;ituation, which can beget the idea of a downward,
rather than an upward, or any other motion, in the
&s;tone or metal?</P>
<P>AND as the fir&s;t imagination or invention of a par|ticular
effect, in all natural operations, is arbitrary,
where we con&s;ult not experience; &s;o mu&s;t we al&s;o
e&s;teem the &s;uppo&s;ed tye or connexion between the
cau&s;e and effect, which binds them together, and ren|ders
it impo&s;&s;ible, that any other effect could re&s;ult
from the operatioon of that cau&s;e. When I &s;ee, for
in&s;tance, a Billiard-ball moving in a &s;trait line towards
another; even &s;uppo&s;e motion in the &s;econd ball
&s;hould by accident be &s;ugge&s;ted to me, as the re&s;ult
of their contact or impul&s;e; may I not conceive, that
a hundred different events might as well follow from
that cau&s;e? May not both the&s;e balls remain at ab&s;o|lute
re&s;t? May not the fir&s;t ball return in a &s;trait line,
or leap off from the &s;econd in any line or direction?
<PB N="52" REF="53">
All the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions are con&s;i&s;tent and conceivable.
Why then &s;hould we give the preference to one,
which is no more con&s;i&s;tent nor conceivable than the
re&s;t? All our rea&s;onings <HI>&agrave; priori</HI> will never be able
to &s;hew us any foundation for this preference.</P>
<P>IN a word, then, every effect is a di&s;tinct event
from its cau&s;e. It could not, therefore, be di&s;covered
In the cau&s;e, and the fir&s;t invention or conception of
it, <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> mu&s;t be entirely arbitrary. And even
after it is &s;ugge&s;ted, the conjunction of it with the
cau&s;e mu&s;t appear equally arbitrary; &s;ince there are
always many other effects, which, to rea&s;on, mu&s;t
&s;eem fully as con&s;i&s;tent and natural. In vain, there|fore,
&s;hould we pretend to determine any &s;ingle event,
or infer any cau&s;e or effect, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
ob&s;ervation and experience.</P>
<P>HENCE we may di&s;cover the rea&s;on, why no philo|&s;opher,
who is rational and mode&s;t, has ever pretended
to a&s;&s;ign the ultimate cau&s;e of any natural operation,
or to &s;how di&s;tinctly the action of that power, which
produced any &s;ingle effect in the univer&s;e. 'Tis con|fe&s;&s;ed,
that the utmo&s;t effort of human rea&s;on is, to
reduce the principles, productive of natural phaeno|mena,
to a greater &s;implicity, and to re&s;olve the
many particular effects into a few general cau&s;e, by
means of rea&s;onings from analogy, experience, and
ob&s;ervation. But as to the cau&s;es of the&s;e general
<PB N="53" REF="54">
cau&s;es, we &s;hould in vain attempt their di&s;covery;
nor &s;hall we ever be able to &s;atisfy our&s;elves, by any
particular explication of them. The&s;e ultimate &s;prings
and principles are totally &s;hut up from human curi|o&s;ity
and enquiry. Ela&s;ticity, gravity, cohe&s;ion of
parts, communication of motion by impul&s;e; the&s;e
are probably the ultimate cau&s;es and principles which
we &s;hall ever di&s;cover in nature; and we may e&s;teem
our&s;elves &s;ufficiently happy, if, by accurate enquiry
and rea&s;oning, we can trace up the particular phaeno|mena
to, or near to, the&s;e general principles. The
mo&s;t perfect philo&s;ophy of the natural kind only
&s;taves off our ignorance a little longer: As perhaps
the mo&s;t perfect philo&s;ophy of the moral or metaphy|&s;ical
kind &s;erves only to di&s;cover larger portion of
our ignorance. Thus the ob&s;ervation of human
blindne&s;s and weakne&s;s is the re&s;ult of all philo&s;ophy,
and meets us, at every turn, in &s;pight of our endea|vours
to elude or avoid it.</P>
<P>NOR is geometry, when taken into the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of natural philo&s;ophy, ever able to remedy this de|fect,
or lead us into the knowlege of ultimate cau&s;es,
by all that accuracy of rea&s;oning, for which it is &s;o
ju&s;tly celebrated. Every part of mixed mathematics
goes upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that certain laws are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
by nature in her operations; and ab&s;tract rea|&s;onings
are employed, either to a&s;&s;i&s;t experience in
the di&s;covery of the&s;e laws, or to determine their in|fluence
<PB N="54" REF="55">
in particular in&s;tances, where it depends upon
any preci&s;e degrees of di&s;tance and quantity. Thus
'tis a law of motion, di&s;covered by experience, that
the moment or force of any body in motion is in the
compound ratio or proportion of its &s;olid contents and
its velocity; and con&s;equently, that a &s;mall &s;orce may
remove the greate&s;t ob&s;tacle or rai&s;e the greate&s;t weight,
if by any contrivance or machinery we can encrea&s;e
the velocity of that force, &s;o as to make it an over|match
for its antagoni&s;t. Geometry a&s;&s;i&s;ts us in the
application of this law, by giving us the ju&s;t di|men&s;ions
of all the parts and figures, which can enter
into any &s;pecies of machine; but &s;till the di&s;covery
of the law it&s;elf is owing merely to experience, and
all the ab&s;tract rea&s;onings in the world could never
lead us one &s;tep towards the knowlege of it. When
we rea&s;on <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> and con&s;ider merely any object or
cau&s;e, as it appears to the mind, independent of all
ob&s;ervation, it never could &s;ugge&s;t to us the notion
of any di&s;tinct object, &s;uch as its effect; much le&s;s,
&s;hew us the in&s;eparable and inviolable connection be|tween
them. A man mu&s;t be very &s;agacious, who
could di&s;cover by rea&s;oning, that cry&s;tal is the effect
of heat, and ice of cold, without being previou&s;ly
acquainted with the operations of the&s;e qualities.</P>

<P>BUT we have not, as yet, attained any tolerable
&s;atisfaction with regard to the que&s;tion fir&s;t propo&s;ed.
Each &s;olution &s;till gives ri&s;e to a new que&s;tion as dif|ficult
as the foregoing, and leads us on to farther en|quiries.
When it is a&s;ked, <HI>What is the nature of all
our rea&s;onings concerning matter of fact?</HI> The proper
an&s;wer &s;eems to be, that they are founded on the rela|tion
of cau&s;e and effect. When again it is a&s;ked,
<HI>What is the foundation of all our rea&s;onings and con|clu&s;ions
concerning that relation?</HI> it may be replied in
one word, EXPERIENCE. But if we &s;till carry on
our &s;ifting humour, and a&s;k, <HI>What is the foundation
of all our conclu&s;ions from experience?</HI> this implies a
new que&s;tion, which may be of more difficult &s;olution
and explication. Philo&s;ophers, that give them&s;elves
airs of &s;uperior wi&s;dom and &s;ufficiency, have a hard
ta&s;k, when they encounter per&s;ons of inqui&s;itive di&s;|po&s;itions,
who pu&s;h them from every corner, to which
they retreat, and who are &s;ure at la&s;t to bring them
to &s;ome dangerous dilemma. The be&s;t expedient to
prevent this confu&s;ion, is to be mode&s;t in our preten|&s;ions;
and even to di&s;cover the difficulty our&s;elves
before it is objected to us. By this means, we may
make a kind of merit of our very ignorance.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57">
I SHALL content my&s;elf, in this &s;ection, with an
ea&s;y ta&s;k, and &s;hall pretend only to give a negative
an&s;wer to the que&s;tion here propo&s;ed. I &s;ay then,
that even after we have experience of the operations
of cau&s;e and effect, our conclu&s;ions from that experi|ence
are <HI>not</HI> founded on rea&s;oning, or any proce&s;s of
the under&s;tanding. This an&s;wer we mu&s;t endeavour,
both to explain and to defend.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t certainly be allowed, that nature has kept
us at a great di&s;tance from all her &s;ecrets, and has
aoffrded us only the knowlege of a few &s;uperficial
qualities of objects, while &s;he conceals from us tho&s;e
powers and principles, on which the influence of the&s;e
objects entirely depends. Our &s;en&s;es inform us of
the colour, weight, and con&s;i&s;tence of bread; but
neither &s;en&s;es nor rea&s;on ever can inform us of tho&s;e
qualities, which fit it for the nouri&s;hment and &s;upport
of a human body. Sight or feeling conveys an idea
of the actual motion of bodies; but as to that won|derful
force or power, which would carry on a mov|ing
body for ever in a continued change of place,
and which bodies never lo&s;e but by communicating it
to others; of this we cannot form the mo&s;t di&s;tant
conception. But notwithanding this ignorance of
natural powers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word, Power, is here u&s;ed in a loo&s;e and popular &s;en&s;e. The more accurate explication of it would give additional evi|dence to this argument. See Sect. 7.</NOTE> and principles, we always pre&s;ume,
<PB N="57" REF="58">
where we &s;ee like &s;en&s;ible qualities, that they have
like &s;ecret powers, and lay our account, that effects,
&s;imilar to tho&s;e, which we have experienced, will
follow from them. If a body of like colour and
con&s;i&s;tence with that bread, which we have formerly
eat, be pre&s;ented to us, we make no &s;cruple of re|peating
the experiment, and expect, with certainty, like
nouri&s;hment and &s;upport. Now this is a proce&s;s of
the mind or thought, of which I would willingly
know the foundation. 'Tis allowed on all hands, that
there is no known connection between the &s;en&s;ible
qualities and the &s;ecret powers; and con&s;equently,
that the mind is not led to form &s;uch a conclu&s;ion
concerning their con&s;tant and regular conjunction, by
any thing which it knows of their nature. As to
pa&s;t <HI>Experience,</HI> it can be allowed to give <HI>direct</HI> and
<HI>certain</HI> information only of tho&s;e preci&s;e objects, and
that preci&s;e period of time, which fell under its cogni|zance:
But why this experience &s;hould be extended
to future times, and to other objects, which, for
aught we know, may be only in appearance &s;imilar;
this is the main que&s;tion on which I would in&s;i&s;t. The
bread, which I formerly eat, nouri&s;hed me; that is,
a body of &s;uch &s;en&s;ible qualities, was, at that time,
endued with &s;uch &s;ecret powers: But does it follow,
that other bread mu&s;t al&s;o nouri&s;h me at another time,
and that like &s;en&s;ible qualities mu&s;t always be attended
with like &s;ecret powers? The con&s;equence &s;eems no
<PB N="58" REF="59">
way nece&s;&s;ary. At lea&s;t, it mu&s;t be acknowleged,
that there is here a con&s;equence drawn by the mind;
that there is a certain &s;tep taken; a proce&s;s of thought,
and an inference, which wants to be explained. The&s;e
two propo&s;itions are far from being the &s;ame, <HI>I have
found that &s;uch an object has always been attended with
&s;uch an effect,</HI> and <HI>I fore&s;ee, that other objects, which
are, to appearance, &s;imilar, will be attended with &s;imi|lar
effects.</HI> I &s;hall allow, if you plea&s;e, that the one
propo&s;ition may ju&s;tly be inferred from the other: I
know in fact, that it always is inferred. But if you
in&s;i&s;t, that the inference is made by a chain of rea&s;on|ing,
I de&s;ire you to produce that rea&s;oning. The con|nection
between the&s;e propo&s;itions is not intuitive.
There is required a medium, which may enable the
mind to draw &s;uch an inference; if indeed it be drawn
by rea&s;oning and argument. What that medium is,
I mu&s;t confe&s;s, pa&s;&s;es my comprehen&s;ion; and 'tis
incumbent on tho&s;e to produce it, who a&s;&s;ert, that it
really exi&s;ts, and is the origin of all our conclu&s;ions
concerning matter of fact.</P>
<P>THIS negative argument mu&s;t certainly, in proce&s;s
of time, become altogether convincing, if many pe|netrating
and able philo&s;ophers &s;hall turn their inqui|ries
this way; and no one be ever able to di&s;cover
any connecting propo&s;ition or intermediate &s;tep, which
&s;upports the under&s;tanding in this conclu&s;ion. But as
the que&s;tion is yet new, every reader may not tru&s;t &s;o
<PB N="59" REF="60">
far to his own penetration, as to conclude, becau&s;e an
argument e&s;capes his re&s;earch and enquiry, that there|fore
it does not really exi&s;t. For this rea&s;on it may
be requi&s;ite to venture upon a more difficult ta&s;k;
and enumerating all the branches of human knowlege,
endeavour to &s;hew, that none of them can afford &s;uch
an argument.</P>
<P>ALL rea&s;onings may be divided into two kinds,
<HI>viz.</HI> demon&s;trative rea&s;onings, or tho&s;e concerning
relations of ideas, and moral rea&s;onings or tho&s;e con|cerning
matter of fact and exi&s;tence. That there are
no demon&s;trative arguments in the ca&s;e, &s;eems evi|dent;
&s;ince it implies no contradiction, that the cour&s;e
of nature may change, and that an object &s;eemingly
like tho&s;e which we have experienced, may be at|tended
with different or contrary effects. May I not
clearly and di&s;tinctly conceive, that a body falling
from the clouds, and which, in all other re&s;pects,
re&s;embles &s;now, has yet the ta&s;te of &s;alt or feeling of
fire? Is there any more intelligible propo&s;ition than
to affirm, that all the trees will flouri&s;h in DE|CEMBER
and JANUARY, and decay in MAY and
JUNE? Now whatever is intelligible, and can be di&s;|tinctly
conceived, implies no contradiction, and can
never be proved fal&s;e by any demon&s;trative argu|ments
or ab&s;tract rea&s;onings <HI>&agrave; priori.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61">
IF we be, therefore, engaged by arguments to put
tru&s;t in pa&s;t experience, and make it the &s;tandard of
our future judgment, the&s;e arguments mu&s;t be pro|bable
only, or &s;uch as regard matter of fact and real
exi&s;tence, according to the divi&s;ion above-mentioned.
But that there are no arguments of this kind, mu&s;t
appear, if our explication of that &s;pecies of rea&s;oning be
admitted as &s;olid and &s;atisfactory. We have &s;aid, that
all arguments concerning exi&s;tence are founded on the
relation of cau&s;e and effect; that our knowlege of
that relation is derived entirely from experience, and
that all our experimental conclu&s;ions proceed upon
the &s;uppo&s;ition that the future will be conformable to
the pa&s;t. To endeavour, therefore, the proof of this
la&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition by probable arguments, or arguments
regarding exi&s;tence, mu&s;t be evidently going in a
circle, and taking that for granted, which is the very
point in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>IN reality, all arguments from experience are
founded on the &s;imilarity, which we di&s;cover among
natural objects, and by which we are induced to ex|pect
effects &s;imilar to tho&s;e, which we have found to
follow from &s;uch objects. And tho' none but a fool
or madman will ever pretend to di&s;pute the authority
of experience, or to reject that great guide of human
life; it may &s;urely be allowed a philo&s;opher to have
&s;o much curio&s;ity at lea&s;t, as to examine the principle
of human nature which gives this mighty authority to
<PB N="61" REF="62">
experience, and makes us draw advantage from that
&s;imilarity, which nature has placed among different
objects. From cau&s;es, which appear <HI>&s;imilar,</HI> we ex|pect
&s;imilar effects. This is the &s;um of all our expe|rimental
conclu&s;ions. Now it &s;eems evident, that if
this conclu&s;ion were formed by rea&s;on, it would be
as perfect at fir&s;t, and upon one in&s;tance, as after ever
&s;o long a cour&s;e of experience. But the ca&s;e is far
otherwi&s;e. Nothing &s;o like as eggs; yet no one, on
account of this apparent &s;imilarity, expects the &s;ame
ta&s;te and reli&s;h in all of them. 'Tis only after a long
cour&s;e of uniform experiments in any kind, that we
attain a firm reliance and &s;ecurity with regard to a
particular event. Now where is that proce&s;s of rea|&s;oning,
which from one in&s;tance draws a conclu&s;ion,
&s;o different from that which it infers from an hun|dred
in&s;tances, that are no way different from that
&s;ingle in&s;tance? This que&s;tion I propo&s;e as much for
the &s;ake of information, as with an intention of rai&s;|ing
difficulties. I cannot find, I cannot imagine any
&s;uch rea&s;oning. But I keep my mind &s;till open to
in&s;truction, if any one will vouch&s;afe to be&s;tow it
on me.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be &s;aid, that from a number of uni|form
experiments, we <HI>infer</HI> a connection between the
&s;en&s;ible qualities and the &s;ecret powers; this, I mu&s;t
confe&s;s, &s;eems the &s;ame difficulty, couched in diffe|rent
<PB N="62" REF="63">
terms. The que&s;tion &s;till recurs, On what pro|ce&s;s
of argument this <HI>inference</HI> is founded? Where
is the medium, the interpo&s;ing ideas, which join pro|popo&s;itions
&s;o very wide of each other? 'Tis con|fe&s;&s;ed,
that the colour, con&s;i&s;tence and other &s;en&s;ible
qualities of bread appear not, of them&s;elves, to have
any connexion with the &s;ecret powers of nouri&s;hment
and &s;upport. For otherwi&s;e we could infer the&s;e &s;e|cret
powers from the fir&s;t appearance of the&s;e &s;en&s;ible
qualities, without the aid of experience; contrary to
the &s;entiment of all philo&s;ophers, and contrary to
plain matter of fact. Here then is our natural &s;tate
of ignorance with regard to the powers and influence
of all objects. How is this remedied by experience?
It only &s;hews us a number of uniform effects, re&s;ult|ing
from certain objects, and teaches us, that tho&s;e
particular objects, at that particular time, were en|dowed
with &s;uch powers and forces. When a new
object, endowed with &s;imilar &s;en&s;ible qualities is pro|duced,
we expect &s;imilar powers and forces, and lay
our account with a like effect. From a body of like
colour and con&s;i&s;tence with bread, we look for like
nouri&s;hment and &s;upport. But this furely is a &s;tep or
progre&s;s of the mind, which wants to be explained.
When a man &s;ays, <HI>I have found, in all pa&s;t in&s;tances,
&s;uch &s;en&s;ible qualities, conjoined with &s;uch &s;ecret powers:</HI>
And when he &s;ays, <HI>&s;imilar &s;en&s;ible qualities will always
be conjoined with &s;imilar &s;ecret powers;</HI> he is not guilty
<PB N="63" REF="64">
of a tautology, nor are the&s;e propo&s;itions in any re|&s;pect
the &s;ame: You &s;ay that the one propo&s;ition is
an inference from another. But you mu&s;t confe&s;s,
that the inference is not intuitive; neither is it de|mon&s;trative:
Of what nature is it then? To &s;ay it
is experimental is begging the que&s;tion. For all in|ferences
from experience &s;uppo&s;e, as their foundation,
that the future will re&s;emble the pa&s;t, and that &s;imi|lar
powers will be conjoined with &s;imilar &s;en&s;ible qua|lities.
If there be any &s;u&s;picion, that the cour&s;e of
nature may change, and that the pa&s;t may be no rule
for the future, all experience becomes u&s;ele&s;s, and
can give ri&s;e to no inference or conclu&s;ion. 'Tis im|po&s;&s;ible,
therefore, that any arguments from experi|ence
can prove this re&s;emblance of the pa&s;t to the
future; &s;ince all the&s;e arguments are founded on the
&s;uppo&s;ition of that re&s;emblance. Let the cour&s;e of
things be allowed hitherto ever &s;o regular; that alone,
without &s;ome new argument or inference, proves not,
that, for the future, it will continue &s;o. In vain do
you pretend to have learnt the nature of bodies from
your pa&s;t experience. Their &s;ecret nature, and con|&s;equently,
all their effects and influence may change,
without any change in their &s;en&s;ible qualities. This
happens &s;ometimes, and with regard to &s;ome objects:
Why may it not happen always, and with regard to
all objects? What logic, what proce&s;s of argument
<PB N="64" REF="65">
&s;ecures you again&s;t this &s;uppo&s;ition? My Practice, you
&s;ay, refutes my doubts. But you mi&s;take the purport
of my que&s;tion. As an agent, I am quite &s;atisfied in
the point; but as a philo&s;opher, who has &s;ome &s;hare
of curio&s;ity, I will not &s;ay &s;ceptici&s;m, I want to learn
the foundation of this inference. No reading, no
enquiry has yet been able to remove my difficulty,
or give me &s;atisfaction in a matter of &s;uch va&s;t im|portance.
Can I do better than propo&s;e the difficulty
to the public, even tho', perhaps, I have &s;mall hopes
of obtaining a &s;olution? We &s;hall at lea&s;t, by this
means, be &s;en&s;ible of our ignorance, if we do not
augment our knowlege.</P>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s, that a man is guilty of unpar|donable
arrogance, who concludes, becau&s;e an argu|ment
has e&s;caped his own inve&s;tigation, that there|fore
it does not really exi&s;t. I mu&s;t al&s;o confe&s;s,
that tho' all the learned, for &s;everal ages, &s;hould have

it may &s;till, perhaps, be ra&s;h to conclude po&s;i|tively,

for &s;uch a &s;ubject, there may &s;till remain a &s;u&s;picion,
that the enumeration is not compleat, or the exami|nation
not accurate. But with regard to the pre&s;ent
&s;ubject, there are &s;ome con&s;iderations, which &s;eem to

remove all this accu&s;ation of arrogance or &s;u&s;picion
of mi&s;take.</P>
<P>'TIS certain, that the mo&s;t ignorant and &s;tupid pea|&s;ants, nay infants, nay even brute bea&s;ts improve by
experience, and learn the qualities of natural objects,
by ob&s;erving the effects, which re&s;ult from them.
When a child has felt the &s;en&s;ation of pain from
touching the flame of a candle, he will be careful not
to put his hand near any candle; but will expect a

&s;en&s;ible qualities and appearance. If you a&s;&s;ert, there|fore,
that the under&s;tanding of the child is led into
this conclu&s;ion by any proce&s;s of argument or ratio|cination,
I may ju&s;tly require you to produce that
argument; nor have you any pretext to refu&s;e &s;o
equitable a demand. You cannot &s;ay, that the ar|gument
is ab&s;tru&s;e, and may po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape your
enquiry; &s;ince you confe&s;s, that it is obvious to the
capacity of a mere infant. If you he&s;itate, there|fore,
a moment, or if, after reflection, you produce
any intricate or profound argument, you, in a man|ner,
give up the que&s;tion, and confe&s;s, that it is
not rea&s;oning which engages us to &s;uppo&s;e the pa&s;t
re&s;embling the future, and to expect &s;imilar effects
from cau&s;es, which are, to appearance, &s;imilar. This
is the propo&s;ition, which I intended to enforce in
the pre&s;ent &s;ection. If I be right, I pretend to have

made no mighty di&s;covery. And if I be wrong, I
mu&s;t acknowlege my&s;elf to be indeed a very back|ward
&s;cholar: &s;ince I cannot now di&s;cover an argument,

<P>THE pa&s;&s;ion for philo&s;ophy, like that for religion,
&s;eems liable to this inconvenience, that, tho' it
aims at the correction of our manners, and extirpa|tion
of our vices, it may only &s;erve, by imprudent
management, to fo&s;ter a predominant inclination, and
pu&s;h the mind, with more determined re&s;olution, to|wards
that &s;ide, which already <HI>draws</HI> too much, by
the bya&s;s and propen&s;ity of the natural temper.
'Tis certain, that, while we a&s;pire to the magnani|mous
firmne&s;s of the philo&s;ophic &s;age, and endeavour
to confine our plea&s;ures altogether within our own
minds, we may, at la&s;t, render our philo&s;ophy, like
that of EPICTETUS, and other <HI>Stoics,</HI> only a more
refined &s;y&s;tem of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and rea&s;on our&s;elves out
of all virtue, as well as &s;ocial enjoyment. While we
&s;tudy with attention the vanity of human life, and
turn all our thoughts on the empty and tran&s;itory
nature of riches and honors, we are, perhaps, all the
<PB N="68" REF="69">
while flattering our natural indolence, which, hating
the bu&s;tle of the world and drudgery of bu&s;ine&s;s,
&s;eeks a pretext of rea&s;on, to give it&s;elf a full and
uncontroled indulgence. There is, however, one
&s;pecies of philo&s;ophy, which &s;eems little liable to
this inconvenience, and that becau&s;e it &s;trikes in with
no di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ion of the human mind, nor can
mingle it&s;elf with any natural affection or propen&s;ity;
and that is the ACADEMIC or SCEPTICAL philo&s;o|phy.
The academics talk always of doubts, and
&s;u&s;pen&s;e of judgment, of danger in ha&s;ty determina|tions,
of confining to very narrow bounds the enqui|ries
of the under&s;tanding, and of renouncing all &s;pe|culations
which lie not within the limits of common
life and practice. Nothing, therefore, can be more
contrary than &s;uch a philo&s;ophy to the &s;upine indo|lence
of the mind, its ra&s;h arrogance, its lofty pre|ten&s;ions,
and its &s;uper&s;titious credulity. Every pa&s;|&s;ion
is mortfied by it, except the love of truth; and
that pa&s;&s;ion never is, nor can be carried to too high
a degree. 'Tis &s;urprizing, therefore, that this philo|&s;ophy,
which, in almo&s;t every in&s;tance, mu&s;t be
harmle&s;s and innocent, &s;hould be the &s;ubject of &s;o
much groundle&s;s reproach and obloquy. But, per|haps,
the very circum&s;tance which renders it &s;o inno|cent,
is what chiefly expo&s;es it to the public hatred,
and re&s;entment. By flattering no irregular pa&s;&s;ion, it
gains few partizans: By oppo&s;ing &s;o many vices and
<PB N="69" REF="70">
follies, it rai&s;es to it&s;elf abundance of enemies, who
&s;tigmatize it as libertine, profane, and irreligious.</P>
<P>NOR need we fear, that this philo&s;ophy, while
it endeavours to limit our enquiries to common life,
&s;hould ever undermine the rea&s;onings of common
life, and carry its doubts &s;o far as to de&s;troy all action,
as well as &s;peculation. Nature will always maintain
her rights, and prevail in the end over any ab&s;tract
rea&s;oning what&s;oever. Tho' we &s;hould conclude,
for in&s;tance, as in the foregoing &s;ection, that, in all
rea&s;onings from experience, there is a &s;tep taken by
the mind, which is not &s;upported by any argument
or proce&s;s of the under&s;tanding; there is no danger,
that the&s;e rea&s;onings, on which almo&s;t all knowledge
depends, will ever be affected by &s;uch a di&s;covery.
If the mind be not engaged by argument to make
this &s;tep, it mu&s;t be induced by &s;ome other principle
of equal weight and authority; and that principle
will pre&s;erve its influence as long as human nature re|mains
the &s;ame. What that principle is, may well
be worth the pains of enquiry.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a per&s;on, tho' endowed with the &s;trong|e&s;t
faculties of rea&s;on and reflection, to be brought
on a &s;udden into this world; he would, indeed, im|mediately
ob&s;erve a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of objects,
and one event following another; but he would not
be able to di&s;cover any thing farther. He would
<PB N="70" REF="71">
not, at fir&s;t, by any rea&s;oning, be able to reach the
idea of cau&s;e and effect; &s;ince the particular powers,
by which all natural operations are performed, never
appear to the &s;en&s;es; nor is it rea&s;onable to conclude,
merely becau&s;e one event, in one in&s;tance, precedes
another, that therefore the one is the cau&s;e, and the
other the effect. Their conjunction may be arbitra|ry
and ca&s;ual. There may be no rea&s;on to infer the
exi&s;tence of the one from the appearance of the
other. And in a word, &s;uch a per&s;on without more
experience, could never employ his conjecture or rea|&s;oning
concerning any matter or fact, or be a&s;&s;ured
of any thing beyond what was immediately pre&s;ent
to his memory and &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE again, that he has acquired more expe|rience,
and has lived &s;o long in the world as to have
ob&s;erved &s;imilar objects or events to be con&s;tantly
conjoined together; what is the con&s;equence of this
experience? He immediately in&s;ers the exi&s;tence of
the one object from the appearance of the other.
Yet he has not, by all his experience, acquired any
idea or knowlege of the &s;ecret power, by which the
one object produces the other; nor is it, by any pro|ce&s;s
of rea&s;oning, he is engaged to draw this infe|rence.
But &s;till he finds him&s;elf determined to draw
it: And tho' he &s;hould be convinced, that his under|&s;tanding
has no part in the operation, he would ne|verthele&s;s
continue in the &s;ame cour&s;e of thinking.
<PB N="71" REF="72">
There is &s;ome other principle, which determines him
to form &s;uch a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THIS principle is CUSTOM or HABIT. For where|ever
the repetition of any particular act or operation
produces a propen&s;ity to renew the &s;ame act or ope|ration,
without being impelled by any rea&s;oning or
proce&s;s of the under&s;tanding; we always &s;ay, that
this propen&s;ity is the effect of <HI>Cu&s;tom.</HI> By employ|ing
that word, we pretend not to have given the ulti|mate
rea&s;on of &s;uch a propen&s;ity. We only point out
a principle of human nature, which is univer&s;ally ac|knowledged,
and which is well known by its effects.
Perhaps, we can pu&s;h our enquiries no farther, or
pretend to give the cau&s;e of this cau&s;e; but mu&s;t re&s;t
contented with it as the ultimate principle, which
we can a&s;&s;ign of all our conclu&s;ions from experience.
'Tis &s;ufficient &s;atisfaction, that we can go &s;o far;
without repining at the narrowne&s;s of our faculties,
becau&s;e they will carry us no farther. And 'tis cer|tain
we here advance a very intelligible propo&s;ition at
lea&s;t, if not a true one, when we a&s;&s;ert, that, after
the con&s;tant conjunction of two objects, heat and
flame, for in&s;tance, weight and &s;olidity, we are de|termined
by cu&s;tom alone to expect the one from
the appearance of the other. This hypothe&s;is &s;eems
even the only one, which explains the difficulty,
why we draw, from a thou&s;and in&s;tances, an in|ference,
which we are not able to draw from
<PB N="72" REF="73">
one in&s;tance, that is, in no re&s;pect, different from
them. Rea&s;on is incapable of any &s;uch varia|tion.
The conclu&s;ions, which it draws from con&s;i|dering
one circle, are the &s;ame which it would form
upon &s;urveying all the circles in the univer&s;e. But no
man, having &s;een only one body move after being
impelled by another, could infer, that every other
body will move after a like impul&s;e. All inferences
from experience, therefore, are effects of cu&s;tom, not
of rea&s;oning<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Nothing is more u&s;ual than for writers even on <HI>moral, poli|tical,</HI> or <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> &s;ubjects, to di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>experi|ence,</HI> and to &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e &s;pecies of argumentation are entirely different from each other. The former are taken for the mere re&s;ult of our intellectual faculties, which, by con&s;ider|ing <HI>&agrave; priori</HI> the nature of things, and examining the effects, that mu&s;t follow from their operation, e&s;tabli&s;h particular principles of &s;cience and philo&s;ophy. The latter are &s;uppo&s;ed to be derived entirely from &s;en&s;e and ob&s;ervation, by which we learn what has actually re&s;ulted from the operation of particular objects, and are thence able to infer, what will, for the future, re&s;ult from them. Thus, for in&s;tance, the limitations and re&s;traints of civil government, and a legal con&s;titution may be de&s;ended, either from <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> which, reflecting on the great frailty and corruption of human nature, teaches, that no man can &s;afely be tru&s;ted with unlimited authority; or from <HI>experience</HI> and hi&s;tory, which inform us of the enormous abu&s;es, that ambition, in every age and country, has been found to make of &s;o imprudent a confi|dence.</P>
<P>The &s;ame di&s;tinction betwixt rea&s;on and experience is main|tained in all our deliberations concerning the conduct of life; while the experienced &s;tate&s;man, general, phy&s;ician or merchant is tru&s;ted and followed; and the unpracti&s;ed novice, with what|ever natural talents endowed, neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed. Tho' it be allowed, that rea&s;on may form very plau&s;ible conjectures with regard to the con&s;equences of &s;uch a particular conduct in &s;uch particular circum&s;tances; 'tis &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed imperfect, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of experience, which is alone able to give &s;tability and certainty to the maxims, derived from &s;tudy and reflection.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding that this di&s;tinction be thus univer&s;ally received, both in the active and &s;peculative &s;cenes of life, I &s;hall not &s;cruple to pronounce, that it is, at bottom, erroneous, or at lea&s;t, &s;uperficial.</P>
<P>If we examine tho&s;e arguments, which, in any of the &s;ciences above-mentioned, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the mere effects of rea&s;oning and reflection, they will all be found to terminate, at la&s;t, in &s;ome general principle or conclu&s;ion, for which we can a&s;&s;ign no rea&s;on but ob&s;ervation and experience. The only difference be|twixt them and tho&s;e maxims, which are vulgarly e&s;teemed the re&s;ult of pure experience, is, that the former cannot be e&s;tab|li&s;hed without &s;ome proce&s;s of thought, and &s;ome reflection on what we have ob&s;erved, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h its circum&s;tances, and trace its con&s;equences: Whereas in the latter, the experi|enced event is exactly and fully &s;imilar to that which we infer as the re&s;ult of any particular &s;ituation. The hi&s;tory of a TIBE|RIUS or a NERO makes us dread a like tyranny were our mo|narchs freed from the re&s;traints of laws and &s;enates: But the ob&s;ervation of any fraud or cruelty in private life is &s;ufficient, with the aid of a little thought, to give us the &s;ame apprehen|&s;ion; while it &s;erves as an in&s;tance of the general corruption of human nature, and &s;hews us the danger which we mu&s;t incur by repo&s;ing an entire confidence in mankind. In both ca&s;es, 'tis experience which is ultimately the foundation of our inference and conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is no man &s;o young and unexperienced, as not to have formed from ob&s;ervation, many general and ju&s;t maxims con|cerning human affairs and the conduct of life; but it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that, when a man comes to put the&s;e in practice, he will be extremely liable to error, till time and farther experience, both enlarge the&s;e maxims, and teach him their proper u&s;e and application. In every &s;ituation or incident, there are many par|ticular and &s;eemingly minute circum&s;tances, which the man of greate&s;t talents is, at fir&s;t, apt to overlook, tho' on them the ju&s;tne&s;s of his conclu&s;ions, and con&s;equently the prudence of his conduct, entirely depend. Not to mention, that, to a young beginner, the general ob&s;ervations and maxims occur not always on the proper occa&s;ions, nor can be immediately applied with due calmne&s;s and di&s;tinction. The truth is, an unexperienced rea&s;oner could be no rea&s;oner at all, were he ab&s;olutely unexpe|rienced; and when we a&s;&s;ign that character to any one, we mean it only in a comparative &s;en&s;e, and &s;uppo&s;e him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ex|perience, in a &s;maller and more imperfect degree.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74">
CUSTOM, then, is the great guide of human life.
'Tis that principle alone, which renders our expe|rience
<PB N="74" REF="75">
u&s;eful to us, and makes us expect for the fu|ture,
a &s;imilar train of events with tho&s;e which have
<PB N="75" REF="76">
appeared in the pa&s;t. Without the influence of cu&s;|tom,
we &s;hould be entirely ignorant of every matter
of fact, beyond what is immediately pre&s;ent to the
memory and &s;en&s;es. We &s;hould never know how to
adju&s;t means to ends, or to employ our natural powers
in the production of any effect. There would be an
end at once of all action, as well as of the chief part
of &s;peculation.</P>
<P>BUT here it may be proper to remark, that tho'
our conclu&s;ions from experience carry us beyond our
memory and &s;en&s;es, and a&s;&s;ure us of matters of fact,
which happened in the mo&s;t di&s;tant places and mo&s;t
remote ages; yet &s;ome fact mu&s;t always be pre&s;ent
to the &s;en&s;es or memory, from which we may fir&s;t pro|ceed
in drawing the&s;e conclu&s;ions. A man, who
&s;hould find in a de&s;ert country the remains of pomp|ous
buildings, would conclude, that the country had,
in antient times, been cultivated by civilized inhabi|tants;
but did nothing of this nature occur to him,
he could never form &s;uch an inference. We learn the
events of former ages from hi&s;tory; but then we mu&s;t
peru&s;e the volumes, in which this in&s;truction is con|tained,
and thence carry up our inferences from one
te&s;timony to another, till we arrive at the eye-witne&s;|&s;es
and &s;pectators of the&s;e di&s;tant events. In a word,
if we proceed not upon &s;ome fact, pre&s;ent to the me|mory
or &s;en&s;es, our rea&s;onings would be merely hy|pothetical;
and however the particular links might
<PB N="76" REF="77">
be connected with each other, the whole chain of in|ferences
would have nothing to &s;upport it, nor could
we ever, by its means, arrive at the knowlege of
any real exi&s;tence. If I a&s;k, why you believe any
particular matter of fact, which you relate, you mu&s;t
tell me &s;ome rea&s;on; and this rea&s;on will be &s;ome
other fact, connected with it: But as you cannot pro|ceed
after this manner, <HI>in infinitum,</HI> you mu&s;t at la&s;t
terminate in &s;ome fact, which is pre&s;ent to your me|mory
or &s;en&s;es; or mu&s;t allow, that your belief is en|tirely
without foundation.</P>
<P>WHAT then is the conclu&s;ion of the whole matter?
A &s;imple one; tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, pretty re|mote
from the common theories of philo&s;ophy. All
belief of matter of fact or real exi&s;tence is derived
merely from &s;ome object, pre&s;ent to the memory or
&s;en&s;es, and a cu&s;tomary conjunction betwixt that and
any other object. Or in other words; having found,
in many in&s;tances, that any two kinds of objects,
flame and heat, &s;now and cold, have always been
conjoined together; if flame or &s;now be pre&s;ented
anew to our &s;en&s;es; the mind is carried by cu&s;tom to
expect heat or cold, and to <HI>believe,</HI> that &s;uch a qua|lity
does exi&s;t, and will di&s;cover it&s;elf upon a nearer
approach. This belief is the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of plac|ing
the mind in &s;uch circum&s;tances. 'Tis an opera|tion
of the &s;oul, when we are &s;o &s;ituated, as unavoid|able
as to feel the pa&s;&s;ion of love, when we receive
<PB N="77" REF="78">
benefits, or hatred, when we meet with injuries.
All the&s;e operations are a &s;pecies of natural in&s;tincts,
which no rea&s;oning or proce&s;s of the thought and un|der&s;tanding
is able, either to produce, or to prevent.</P>
<P>AT this point, it would be very allowable for us
to &s;top our philo&s;ophical re&s;earches. In mo&s;t que&s;|tions,
we can never make a &s;ingle &s;tep farther; and
in all que&s;tions, we mu&s;t terminate here at la&s;t, after
our mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s and curious enquiries. But &s;till our
curio&s;ity will be pardonable, perhaps commendable,
if it carry us on to &s;till farther re&s;earches, and make
us examine more accurately the nature of this <HI>belief,</HI>
and of the <HI>cu&s;tomary conjunction,</HI> whence it is derived.
By this means we may meet &s;ome explications and
analogies, that will give &s;atisfaction; at lea&s;t to &s;uch
as love the ab&s;tract &s;ciences, and can be entertained
with &s;peculations, which, however accurate, may
&s;till retain a degree of doubt and uncertainty. As to
readers of a different ta&s;te; the remaining part of
this &s;ection is not calculated for them, and the fol|lowing
enquiries may well be under&s;tood, tho' it be

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing more free than the imagination
of man; and tho' it cannot exceed that original &s;tock
of ideas, which is furni&s;hed by the internal and ex|ternal
<PB N="78" REF="79">
&s;en&s;es, it has unlimited power of mixing, com|pounding,
&s;eparating, and dividing the&s;e ideas, to
all the varieties of fiction and vi&s;ion. It can feign a
train of events, with all the appearance of reali|ty,
a&s;cribe to them a particular time and place, con|ceive
them as exi&s;tent, and paint them out to it&s;elf
with every circum&s;tance, that belongs to any hi&s;torical
fact, which it believes with the greate&s;t certainty.
Wherein, therefore, con&s;i&s;ts the difference between
&s;uch a fiction and belief? It lies not merely in any
peculiar idea, which is annexed to &s;uch a conception,
as commands our a&s;&s;ent, and which is wanting to every
known fiction. For as the mind has authority over
all its ideas, it could voluntarily annex this particular
idea to any fiction, and con&s;equently be able to be|lieve
whatever it plea&s;es; contrary to what we find
by daily experience. We can, in our conception,
join the head of a man to the body of a hor&s;e; but
it is not in our power to believe, that &s;uch an animal
has ever really exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>IT follows, therefore, that the difference between
<HI>fiction</HI> and <HI>belief</HI> lies in &s;ome &s;entiment or feeling,
which is annexed to the latter, not to the former, and
which depends not on the will, nor can be com|manded
at plea&s;ure. It mu&s;t be excited by nature,
like all other &s;entiments; and mu&s;t ari&s;e from the par|ticular
&s;ituation, in which the mind is placed at any
particular juncture. Whenever any object is pre|&s;ented
<PB N="79" REF="80">
to the memory or &s;en&s;es, it immediately, by
the force of cu&s;tom, carries the imagination to con|ceive
that object, which is u&s;ually conjoined to it;
and this conception is attended with a feeling or &s;en|timent,
different from the loo&s;e reveries of the fancy.
In this con&s;i&s;ts the whole nature of belief. For as
there is no matter of fact which we believe &s;o firmly,
that we cannot conceive the contrary, there would
be no difference between the conception a&s;&s;ented to,
and that which is rejected, were it not for &s;ome &s;en|timent,
which di&s;tingui&s;hes the one from the other.
If I &s;ee a billiard-ball moving towards another, on a
&s;mooth table, I can ea&s;ily conceive it to &s;top upon
contact. This conception implies no contradiction;
but &s;till it feels very differently from that conception,
by which I repre&s;ent to my&s;elf the impul&s;e, and the
communication of motion from one ball to another.</P>
<P>WERE we to attempt a <HI>definition</HI> of this &s;entiment,
we &s;hould, perhaps, find it a very difficult, if not an
impo&s;&s;ible ta&s;k; in the &s;ame manner as if we &s;hould
endeavour to define the feeling of cold or pa&s;&s;ion of
anger, to a creature who never had an experience of
the&s;e &s;entiments. BELIEF is the true and proper
name of this feeling; and no one is ever at a lo&s;s to
know the meaning of that term; becau&s;e every man
is every moment con&s;cious of the &s;entiment, repre|&s;ented
by it. It may not, however, be improper to
attempt a <HI>de&s;cription</HI> of this &s;entiment; in hopes we
<PB N="80" REF="81">
may, by that means, arrive at &s;ome analogies, which
may afford a more perfect explication of it. I &s;ay
then, that belief is nothing but a more vivid, lively,
forcible, firm, &s;teady conception of an object, than
what the imagination alone is ever able to attain.
This variety of terms, which may &s;eem &s;o unphilo|&s;ophical,
is intended only to expre&s;s that act of the
mind, which renders realities, or what is taken for
&s;uch, more pre&s;ent to us than fictions, cau&s;es them to
weigh more in the thought, and gives them a &s;uperior
influence on the pa&s;&s;ions and imagination. Provided
we agree about the thing, 'tis needle&s;s to di&s;pute
about the terms. The imagination has the command
over all its ideas, and can join and mix and vary
them, in all the ways po&s;&s;ible. It may conceive ficti|tious
objects with all the circum&s;tances of place and
time. It may &s;et them, in a manner, before our eyes,
in their true colors, ju&s;t as they might have exi&s;ted.
But as it is impo&s;&s;ible, that that faculty of imagina|tion
can ever, of it&s;elf, reach belief, 'tis evident,
that belief con&s;i&s;ts not in the peculiar nature or order
of ideas, but in the <HI>manner</HI> of their conception, and
in their <HI>feeling</HI> to the mind. I confe&s;s, that 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible
perfectly to explain this feeling or manner of
conception. We may make u&s;e of words, which ex|pre&s;s
&s;omething near it. But its true and proper
name, as we ob&s;erved before, is <HI>belief;</HI> which is a
term, that every one &s;ufficiently under&s;tands in com|mon
life. And in philo&s;ophy, we can go no farther

than a&s;&s;ert, that <HI>belief</HI> is &s;omething felt by the mind,
which di&s;tingui&s;hes the ideas of the judgment from
the fictions of the imagination. It gives them more
force and influence; makes them appear of greater
importance; inforces them in the mind; and renders
them the governing principle of all our actions. I
hear at pre&s;ent, for in&s;tance, a per&s;on's voice, with
whom I am acquainted; and the &s;ound comes as from
the next room. This impre&s;&s;ion of my &s;en&s;es imme|diately
conveys my thought to the per&s;on, together
with all the &s;urrounding objects. I paint them out to
my&s;elf as exi&s;ting at pre&s;ent, with the &s;ame qualities
and relations, of which I formerly knew them po&s;&s;e&s;t.
The&s;e ideas take fa&s;ter hold of my mind, than ideas
of an inchanted ca&s;tle. They are very different to
the feeling, and have a much greater influence of
every kind, either to give plea&s;ure or pain, joy or &s;or|row.</P>
<P>LET
us, then, take in the whole compa&s;s of this
doctrine, and allow, that the &s;entiment of belief is
nothing but a conception of an object more inten&s;e
and &s;teady than what attends the mere fictions of the
imagination, and that this <HI>manner</HI> of conception ari&s;es
from a cu&s;tomary conjunction of the object with
&s;omething pre&s;ent to the memory or &s;en&s;es: I believe
that it will not be difficult, upon the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions,
to find other operations of the mind analogous to it,
<PB N="82" REF="83">
and to trace up the&s;e phaenomena to principles &s;till
more general.</P>
<P>WE have already ob&s;erved, that nature has e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
connexions among particular ideas, and that
no &s;ooner one idea occurs to our thoughts than it in|troduces
its correlative, and carries our attention to|wards
it, by a gentle and in&s;en&s;ible movement. The&s;e
principles of connexion or a&s;&s;ociation we have re|duced
to three, <HI>viz. Re&s;emblance, Contiguity,</HI> and
<HI>Cau&s;ation;</HI> which are the only bonds, that unite our
thoughts together, and beget that regular train of
reflection or di&s;cour&s;e, which, in a greater or le&s;s de|gree,
takes place among all mankind. Now here
ari&s;es a que&s;tion, on which the &s;olution of the pre&s;ent
difficulty will depend. Does it happen, in all the&s;e
relations, that, when one of the objects is pre&s;ented
to the &s;en&s;es or memory, the mind is not only carried
to the conception of the correlative, but reaches a
&s;teadier and &s;tronger conception of it than what other|wi&s;e
it would have been able to attain? This &s;eems
to be the ca&s;e with that belief, which ari&s;es from the
relation of cau&s;e and effect. And if the ca&s;e be the
&s;ame with the other relations or principles of a&s;&s;oci|ation,
we may e&s;tabli&s;h this as a general law, which
takes place in all the operations of the mind.</P>
<P>WE may, therefore, ob&s;erve, as the fir&s;t experi|ment
to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that, upon the appear|ance
<PB N="83" REF="84">
of the picture of an ab&s;ent friend, our idea of
him is evidently enlivened by the <HI>re&s;emblance,</HI> and
that every pa&s;&s;ion, which that idea occa&s;ions, whe|ther
of joy or &s;orrow, acquires new force and vi|gor.
In producing this effect, there concur both a
relation and a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion. Where the picture
bears him no re&s;emblance, or at lea&s;t was not intend|ed
for him, it never &s;o much as conveys our thought
to him: And where it is ab&s;ent, as well as the per|&s;on;
though the mind may pa&s;s from the thought of
the one to that of the other; it feels its idea to be
rather weakened than enlivened by that tran&s;ition.
We take a plea&s;ure in viewing the picture of a friend,
when 'tis &s;et before us; but when 'tis removed, ra|ther
chu&s;e to con&s;ider him directly, than by reflection
in an image, which is equally di&s;tant and ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>THE ceremonies of the ROMAN CATHOLIC reli|gion
may be con&s;idered as experiments of the &s;ame
nature. The devotees of that &s;uper&s;tition u&s;ually
plead in excu&s;e of the mummeries, with which they
are upbraided, that they feel the good effect of tho&s;e
external motions, and po&s;tures, and actions, in en|livening
their devotion and quickening their &s;ervor,
which otherwi&s;e would decay, if directed intirely to
di&s;tant and immaterial objects. We &s;hadow out the
objects of our faith, &s;ay they, in &s;en&s;ible types and
images, and render them more pre&s;ent to us by the
immediate pre&s;ence of the&s;e types, than 'tis po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="84" REF="85">
for us to do, merely by an intellectual view and con|templation.
Sen&s;ible objects have always a greater
influence on the fancy than any other; and this in|fluence
they readily convey to tho&s;e ideas, to which
they are related, and which they re&s;emble. I &s;hall
only infer from the&s;e practices, and this rea&s;oning,
that the effect of re&s;emblance in enlivening the ideas
is very common; and as in every ca&s;e a re&s;emblance
and a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t concur, we are abun|dantly
&s;upplied with experiments to prove the reality
of the foregoing principle.</P>
<P>WE may add force to the&s;e experiments by others
of a different kind, in con&s;idering the effects of <HI>conti|guity</HI>
as well as of <HI>re&s;emblance.</HI> 'Tis certain that di|&s;tance
dimini&s;hes the force of every idea, and that
upon our approach to any object; tho' it does not
di&s;cover it&s;elf to our &s;en&s;es; it operates upon the
mind with an influence, which imitates an immediate
impre&s;&s;ion. The thinking on any object readily
tran&s;ports the mind to what is contiguous; but
'tis only the actual pre&s;ence of an object, that tran&s;|ports
it with a &s;uperior vivacity. When I am a
few miles from home, whatever relates to it touches
me more nearly than when I am two hundred leagues
di&s;tant; tho' even at that di&s;tance the reflecting on
any thing in the neighbourhood of my friends or fa|mily
naturally produces an idea of them. But as in
this latter ca&s;e, both the objects of the mind are
ideas; notwith&s;tanding there is an ea&s;y tran&s;ition be|tween
<PB N="85" REF="86">
them; that tran&s;ition alone is not able to give
a &s;uperior vivacity to any of the ideas, for want of
&s;ome immediate impre&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>"Naturane nobis, inquit, datum dicam, an errore quo|dam, ut, cum ea loca videamus, in quibus memoria dignos viros acceperimus multum e&s;&s;e ver&s;atos, magis moveamur, quam &s;iquando corum ip&s;orum aut facta audiamus aut &s;crip|tum aliquod legamus?

<P>NO one can doubt but cau&s;ation has the &s;ame in|fluence
as the other two relations of re&s;emblance and
contiguity. Super&s;titious people are fond of the re|licts
of &s;aints and holy men, for the &s;ame rea&s;on,
that they &s;eek after types or images, in order to en|liven
their devotion, and give them a more intimate
and &s;trong conception of tho&s;e exemplary lives, which
they de&s;ire to imitate. Now 'tis evident, that one
of the be&s;t relicts, which a devotee could procure,
would be the handywork of a &s;aint; and if his cloaths
<PB N="86" REF="87">
and furniture are ever to be con&s;idered in this light,
'tis becau&s;e they were once at his di&s;po&s;al, and were
moved and affected by him; in which re&s;pect they
are to be con&s;idered as imperfect effects, and as con|nected
with him by a &s;horter chain of con&s;equences
than any of tho&s;e, by which we learn the reality of
his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, that the &s;on of a friend, who had been
long dead or ab&s;ent, were pre&s;ented to us; 'tis evi|dent,
that this object would in&s;tantly revive its corre|lative
idea, and recal to our thoughts all pa&s;t intima|cies
and familiarities in more lively colors than they
would otherwi&s;e have appeared to us. This is ano|ther
phaenomenon, which &s;eems to prove the principle
above-mentioned.</P>
<P>WE may ob&s;erve, that in the&s;e phaenomena the
belief of the correlative object is always pre-&s;up|po&s;ed;
without which the relation could have no ef|fect
in enlivening the idea. The influence of the
picture &s;uppo&s;es, that we <HI>believe</HI> our friend to have
once exi&s;ted. Contiguity to home can never excite
our ideas of home, unle&s;s we <HI>believe</HI> that it really ex|i&s;ts.
Now I a&s;&s;ert, that this belief, where it reaches
beyond the memory or &s;en&s;es, is of a &s;imilar nature,
and ari&s;es from &s;imilar cau&s;es, with the tran&s;ition of
thought and vivacity of conception here explained.
When I throw a piece of dry wood into a fire, my
<PB N="87" REF="88">
mind is immediately carried to conceive, that it aug|ments,
not extingui&s;hes the flame. This tran&s;ition of
thought from the cau&s;e to the effect proceeds not from
rea&s;on. It derives its origin altogether from cu&s;tom
and experience. And as it fir&s;t begins from an ob|ject,
pre&s;ent to the &s;en&s;es, it renders the idea or con|ception
of flame more &s;trong and lively than any
loo&s;e, floating reverie of the imagination. That idea
ari&s;es immediately. The thought moves in&s;tantly to|wards
it, and conveys to it all that force of concep|tion,
which is derived from the impre&s;&s;ion pre&s;ent to
the &s;en&s;es. When a &s;word is levelled at my brea&s;t,
does not the idea of wound and pain &s;trike me more
&s;trongly, than when a gla&s;s of wine is pre&s;ented to
me, even tho' by accident this idea &s;hould occur after
the appearance of the latter object? But what is there
in this whole matter to cau&s;e &s;uch a &s;trong concep|tion,
except only a pre&s;ent object and cu&s;tomary tran|&s;ition
to the idea of another object, which we have
been accu&s;tomed to conjoin with the former? This is
the whole operation of the mind in all our conclu&s;ions
concerning matter of fact and exi&s;tence; and 'tis a
&s;atisfaction to find &s;ome analogies, by which it may
be explained. The tran&s;ition from a pre&s;ent object
does in all ca&s;es give &s;trength and &s;olidity to the related
idea.</P>
<P>HERE is a kind of pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed harmony be|tween
the cour&s;e of nature and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our
<PB N="88" REF="89">
ideas; and tho' the powers and forces, by which the
former is governed, be wholly unknown to us; yet
our thoughts and conceptions have &s;till, we find, gone
on in the &s;ame train with the other works of nature.
Cu&s;tom is that admirable principle, by which this
corre&s;pondence has been effected; &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence of our &s;pecies, and the regulation of our
conduct, in every circum&s;tance and occurrence of hu|man
life. Had not the pre&s;ence of an object in&s;tant|ly
excited the idea of tho&s;e objects, commonly
conjoined with it, all our knowledge mu&s;t have been
limited to the narrow &s;phere of our memory and &s;en|&s;es;
and we &s;hould never have been able to adju&s;t
means to ends, nor employ our natural powers, either
to the producing of good, or avoiding of evil. Tho&s;e,
who delight in the di&s;covery and contemplation of <HI>fi|nal
cau&s;es,</HI> have here ample &s;ubject to employ their
wonder and admiration.</P>
<P>I SHALL add, for a further confirmation of the
foregoing theory, that as this operation of the mind,
by which we infer like effects from like cau&s;es, and
<HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of all hu|man
creatures, it is not probable that it could be
tru&s;ted to the fallacious deductions of our rea&s;on,
which is &s;low in its operations; appears not, in any
degree, during the fir&s;t years of infancy; and at be&s;t
is, in every age and period of human life, extremely
liable to error and mi&s;take. 'Tis more conformable
<PB N="89" REF="90">
to the ordinary wi&s;dom of nature of &s;ecure &s;o nece&s;&s;a|ry
an act of the mind, by &s;ome in&s;tinct or mechanical
tendency, which may be infallible in its operations,
may di&s;cover it&s;elf at the fir&s;t appearance of life and
thought, and may be independent of all the labored
deductions of the under&s;tanding. As nature has
taught us the u&s;e of our limbs, without giving us the
knowledge of the mu&s;cles and nerves, by which they
are actuated; &s;o has &s;he implanted in us an in&s;tinct,
which carries forward the thought in a corre&s;pondent
cour&s;e to that which &s;he has e&s;tabli&s;hed among exter|nal
objects; tho' we are ignorant of tho&s;e powers
and forces, on which this regular cour&s;e and &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of objects totally depends.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of PROBABILITY.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. LOCKE divides all arguments into demon&s;trative and probable. In this view, we mu&s;t &s;ay, that 'tis only probable all men mu&s;t die, or that the &s;un will ri&s;e to morrow. But to conform our language more to common u&s;e, we &s;hould divide arguments into <HI>demon&s;trations, proofs,</HI> and <HI>probabilities.</HI> By proofs meaning &s;uch arguments from experience as leave no room for doubt or oppo&s;ition.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>THO' there be no &s;uch thing as <HI>Chance</HI> in the
world; our ignorance of the real cau&s;e of any
event has the &s;ame influence on the under&s;tanding,
and begets a like &s;pecies of belief or opinion.</P>
<P>THERE is certainly a probability, which ari&s;es from
a &s;uperiority of chances on any &s;ide; and according
as this &s;uperiority encrea&s;es, and &s;urpa&s;&s;es the oppo|&s;ite
chances, the probability receives a proportionable
encrea&s;e, and begets &s;till a higher degree of belief or
<PB N="92" REF="92">
a&s;&s;ent to that &s;ide, in which we di&s;cover the &s;uperio|rity.
If a dye were marked with one figure or num|ber
of &s;pots on four &s;ides, and with another figure
or number of &s;pots on the two remaining &s;ides, it
would be more probable, that the former &s;hould turn
up than the latter; tho' if it had a thou&s;and &s;ides
marked in the &s;ame manner, and only one &s;ide diffe|rent,
the probability would be much higher, and
our belief or expectation of the event more &s;teady
and &s;ecure. This proce&s;s of the thought or rea&s;on|ing
may &s;eem trivial and obvious; but to tho&s;e, who
con&s;ider it more narrowly, it may, perhaps, afford
matter for very curious &s;peculations.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems evident, that when the mind looks for|ward
to di&s;cover the event, which may re&s;ult from the
throw of &s;uch a dye, it con&s;iders the turning up of
each particular &s;ide as alike probable; and this is the
very nature of chance, to render all the particular
events, comprehended in it, entirely equal. But
finding a greater number of &s;ides concur in the one
event than in the other, the mind is carried more fre|quently
to that event, and meets it oftener, in revolv|ing
the various po&s;&s;ibilities or chances, on which the
ultimate re&s;ult depends. This concurrence of &s;everal
views in one particular event begets immediately, by
an inexplicable contrivance of nature, the &s;entiment
of belief, and gives that event the advantage over its
<PB N="93" REF="93">
antagoni&s;t, which is &s;upported by a &s;maller number
of views, and recurs le&s;s frequently to the mind. If
we allow, that belief is nothing but a firmer and
&s;tronger conception of an object than what attends
the mere fictions of the imagination, this operation
may, perhaps, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be accounted for.
The concurrence of the&s;e &s;everal views or glimp&s;es
imprints its idea more &s;trongly on the imagination;
gives it &s;uperior force and vigor; renders its influence
on the pa&s;&s;ions and affections more &s;en&s;ible; and in
a word, begets that reliance or &s;ecurity, which con|&s;titutes
the nature of belief and opinion.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e is the &s;ame with the probability of cau&s;es,
as with that of chance. There are &s;ome cau&s;es,
which are entirely uniform and con&s;tant in producing
a particular effect; and no in&s;tance has ever yet been
found of any failure or irregularity in their operation.
Fire has always burnt, and water &s;uffocated every hu|man
creature: The production of motion by impul&s;e
and gravity is an univer&s;al law, which has hitherto
admitted of no exception. But there are other cau&s;es
which have been found more irregular and uncertain;
nor has rhubarb proved always a purge, or opium a
&s;oporific to every one, who has taken the&s;e medicines.
'Tis true, when any cau&s;e fails of producing its u&s;ual
effect, philo&s;ophers a&s;cribe not this to any irregularity
in nature; but &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ome &s;ecret cau&s;es, in
the particular &s;tructure of parts, have prevented the
<PB N="94" REF="94">
operation. Our rea&s;onings, however, and conclu|&s;ions
concerning the event are the &s;ame as if this prin|ciple
had no place. Being determined by cu&s;tom to
transfer the pa&s;t to the future, in all our inferences;
where the pa&s;t has been entirely regular and uniform,
we expect the event with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;urance, and
leave no room for any contrary &s;uppo&s;ition. But
where different effects have been found to follow from
cau&s;es, which are <HI>to appearance</HI> exactly &s;imilar, all
the&s;e various effects mu&s;t occur to the mind in tran&s;|fering
the pa&s;t to the future, and enter into our con&s;i|deration,
when we determine the probability of the
event. Tho' we give the preference to that which
has been found mo&s;t u&s;ual, and believe that this effect
will exi&s;t, we mu&s;t not overlook the other effects, but
mu&s;t give each of them a particular weight and au|thority,
in proportion as we have found it to be more
or le&s;s frequent. 'Tis more probable, in every place
of EUROPE, that there will be fro&s;t &s;ometime in JA|NUARY,
than that the weather will continue open
throughout that whole month; who' this probability
varies according to the different climates, and ap|proaches
to a certainty in the more northern king|doms.
Here then it &s;eems evident, that when we
transfer the pa&s;t to the future, in order to determine
the effect, which will re&s;ult from any cau&s;e, we tran&s;|fer
all the different events, in the &s;ame proportion as
they have appeared in the pa&s;t, and conceive one to
have exi&s;ted a hundred times, for in&s;tance, another
<PB N="95" REF="95">
ten times, and another once. As a great number of
views do here concur in one event, they fortify and
confirm it to the imagination, beget that &s;entiment
which we call <HI>belief,</HI> and give it the preference above
its antagoni&s;t, which is not &s;upported by an equal
number of experiments, and occurs not &s;o frequently
to the thought in transferring the pa&s;t to the future.
Let any one try to account for this operation of the
mind upon any of the received &s;y&s;tems of philo&s;ophy,
and he will be &s;en&s;ible of the difficulty. For my part,
I &s;hall think it &s;ufficient, if the pre&s;ent hints excite
the curio&s;ity of philo&s;ophers, and make them &s;en&s;ible
how extremely defective all common theories are, in
treating of &s;uch curious and &s;uch &s;ublime &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>THE great advantage of the mathematical &s;ci|ences
above the moral con&s;i&s;ts in this, that the
ideas of the former, being &s;en&s;ible, are always clear
and determinate, the &s;malle&s;t di&s;tinction between
them is immediately perceptible, and the &s;ame terms
are &s;till expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ame ideas, without ambi|guity
or variation. An oval is never mi&s;taken for a
circle, nor an hyperbola for an ellip&s;is. The i&s;o&s;celes
and &s;calenum are di&s;tingui&s;hed by boundaries more
exact than vice and virtue, right and wrong. If any
term be de&s;ined in geometry, the mind readily, of it|&s;elf
&s;ub&s;titutes, on all occa&s;ions, the definition for the
term defined; Or even when no definition is employ|ed,
the object it&s;elf may be pre&s;ented to the &s;en&s;es,
and by that means be &s;teadily and clearly apprehend|ed.
But the finer &s;entiments of the mind, the opera|tions
of the under&s;tanding, the various agitations of
<PB N="98" REF="97">
the pa&s;&s;ions, tho' really in them&s;elves di&s;tinct, ea&s;ily
e&s;cape us, when &s;urveyed by reflection; nor is it in
our power to recall the original object, as often as we
have occa&s;ion to contemplate it. Ambiguity, by this
means, is gradually introduced into our rea&s;onings:
Similar objects are readily taken to be the &s;ame: And
the conclu&s;ion becomes at la&s;t very wide of the premi|&s;es.</P>
<P>ONE
may &s;afely, however, affirm, that, if we con|&s;ider
the&s;e &s;ciences in a proper light, their advantages
and di&s;advantages very nearly compen&s;ate each other,
and reduce both of them to a &s;tate of equality. If
the mind with greater facility retains the ideas of ge|ometry
clear and determinate, it mu&s;t carry on a
much longer and more intricate chain of rea&s;oning,
and compare ideas much wider of each other, in order
to reach the ab&s;tru&s;er truths of that &s;cience. And if
moral ideas are apt, without extreme care, to fall into
ob&s;curity and confu&s;ion, the inferences are always
much &s;horter in the&s;e di&s;qui&s;itions, and the interme|diate
&s;teps, which lead to the conclu&s;ion, much fewer
than in the &s;ciences which treat of quantity and num|ber.
In reality, there is &s;carce a propo&s;ition in EU|CLID
&s;o &s;imple, as not to con&s;i&s;t of more parts, than
are to be found in any moral rea&s;oning which runs
not into chimera and conceit. Where we trace the
principles of the human mind thro' a few &s;teps, we
may be very well &s;atisfied with our progre&s;s; con&s;i|dering
<PB N="99" REF="98">
how &s;oon nature throws a bar to all our in|quiries
concerning cau&s;es, and reduces us to an ac|knowledgment
of our ignorance. The chief ob&s;ta|cle,
therefore, to our improvement in the moral or
metaphy&s;ical &s;ciences is the ob&s;curity of the ideas, and
ambiguity of the terms. The principal difficulty in
the mathematics is the length of inferences and com|pa&s;s
of thought, requi&s;ite to the forming any conclu|&s;ion.
And perhaps, our progre&s;s in natural philo|&s;ophy
is chiefly retarded by the want of proper expe|riments
and phaenomena, which often are di&s;covered
by chance, and cannot always be found, when requi|&s;ite,
even by the mo&s;t diligent and prudent inquiry.
As moral philo&s;ophy &s;eems hitherto to have received
le&s;s improvements than either geometry or phy&s;ics,
we may conclude, that, if there be any difference in
this re&s;pect among the&s;e &s;ciences, the difficulties,
which ob&s;truct the progre&s;s of the former, require &s;u|perior
care and capacity to be &s;urmounted.</P>
<P>THERE are no ideas, which occur in metaphy&s;ics,
more ob&s;cure and uncertain, than tho&s;e of <HI>power&punc;
force, energy,</HI> or <HI>nece&s;&s;ary connexion,</HI> of which it is every
moment nece&s;&s;ary for us to treat in all our di&s;qui&s;itions.
We &s;hall, therefore, endeavour, in this &s;ection, to fix,
if po&s;&s;ible, the preci&s;e meaning of the&s;e terms, and
thereby remove &s;ome part of that ob&s;curity, which is
&s;o much complained of in this &s;pecies of philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="99">
IT &s;eems a propo&s;ition, which will not admit of
much di&s;pute, that all our ideas are nothing but co|pies
of our impre&s;&s;ions, or, in other words, that 'tis
impo&s;&s;ible for us to <HI>think</HI> of any thing, which we have
not antecedently <HI>felt,</HI> either by our external or internal
&s;en&s;es. I have endeavoured<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Section II.</NOTE> to explain and prove
this propo&s;ition, and have expre&s;&s;ed my hopes, that,
by a proper application of it, men may reach a greater
clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion in philo&s;ophical rea&s;onings,
than what they have hitherto been ever able to at|tain.
Complex ideas may, perhaps, be well known
by definition, which is nothing but an enumeration of
tho&s;e parts or &s;imple ideas, that compo&s;e them. But
when we have pu&s;hed up definitions to the mo&s;t &s;im|ple
ideas, and find &s;till &s;ome ambiguity and ob&s;curity;
what re&s;ource are we then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of? By what in|vention
can we throw light upon the&s;e ideas, and ren|der
them altogether preci&s;e and determinate to our
intellectual view? Produce the impre&s;&s;ions or original
&s;entiments, from which the ideas are copied. The&s;e
impre&s;&s;ions are all &s;trong and &s;en&s;ible. They admit
not of ambiguity. They are not only placed in a
full light them&s;elves, but may throw light on their
corre&s;pondent ideas, which lie in ob&s;curity. And by
this means, we may, perhaps, attain a new micro&s;cope
or &s;pecies of optics, by which, in the moral &s;ciences,
the mo&s;t minute, and mo&s;t &s;imple ideas may be &s;o en|larged
<PB N="101" REF="100">
as to fall readily under our apprehen&s;ion, and
be equally known with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible
ideas, which can be the object of our inquiry.</P>
<P>To be fully acquainted, therefore, with the idea of
power or nece&s;&s;ary connexion, let us examine its im|pre&s;&s;ion;
and in order to find the impre&s;&s;ion with
greater certainty, let us &s;earch for it in all the &s;ources,
from which it may po&s;&s;ibly be derived.</P>
<P>WHEN we look about us towards external objects,
and con&s;ider the operation of cau&s;es, we are never
able, in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, to di&s;cover any power or ne|ce&s;&s;ary
connexion; any quality, which binds the effect
to the cau&s;e, and renders the one an infallible con&s;e|quence
of the other. We only find, that the one
does actually, in fact, follow the other. The impul&s;e
of one billiard-ball is attended with motion in the &s;e|cond.
This is the whole that appears to the <HI>outward</HI>
&s;en&s;es. The mind feels no &s;entiment or <HI>inward</HI> im|pre&s;&s;ion
from this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of objects: Con&s;equently,
there is not, in any &s;ingle, particular in&s;tance of cau&s;e
and effect, any thing which can &s;ugge&s;t the idea of
power or nece&s;&s;ary connexion.</P>
<P>FROM the fir&s;t appearance of an object, we never
can conjecture what effect will re&s;ult from it. But
were the power or energy of any cau&s;e di&s;coverable by
the mind, we could fore&s;ee the effect, even without
<PB N="102" REF="101">
experience, and might, at fir&s;t, pronounce with cer|tainty
concerning it, by the mere dint of thought and
rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>IN reality, there is no part of matter, that does ever,
by its &s;en&s;ible qualities, di&s;cover any power or energy,
or give us ground to imagine, that it could produce
any thing, or be followed by any other object, which
we could denominate its effect. Solidity, exten&s;ion,
motion; the&s;e qualities are all complete in them&s;elves,
and never point out any other event which may re&s;ult
from them. The &s;cenes of the univer&s;e are continual|ly
&s;hifting, and one object follows another in an unin|terrupted
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but the power or force, which
actuates the whole machine, is intirely concealed from
us, and never di&s;covers it&s;elf in any of the &s;en&s;ible qua|lities
of body. We know, that, in fact, heat is a con|&s;tant
attendant of flame; but what is the connexion
between them, we have no room &s;o much as to con|jecture
or imagine. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, that
the idea of power can be derived from the contem|plation
of bodies, in &s;ingle in&s;tances of their operation;
becau&s;e no bodies ever di&s;cover any power, which can
be the original of this idea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. LOCKE, in his chapter of power, &s;ays that finding from experience, that there are &s;everal new productions in matter, and concluding that there mu&s;t &s;omewhere be a power capable of producing them, we arrive at la&s;t by this rea&s;oning at the idea of power. But no rea&s;oning can ever give us a new, original, &s;imple idea; as this philo&s;opher him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es. This, therefore, can never be the origin of that idea.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="102">
SINCE, therefore, external objects, as they appear
to the &s;en&s;es, give us no idea of power or nece&s;&s;ary
connexion, by their operations in particular in&s;tances,
let us &s;ee, whether this idea be derived from re|flection
on the operations of our own minds, and be
copied from any internal impre&s;&s;ion. It may be &s;aid,
that we are every moment con&s;cious of power in our
own minds; while we feel, that, by the &s;imple com|mand
of our will, we can move the organs of our
body, or direct the faculties of our minds, in their
operation. An act of volition produces motion in our
limbs, or rai&s;es a new idea in our imagination. This
influence of the will we know by con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.
Hence we acquire the idea of power or energy; and
are certain, that we our&s;elves and all other intelligent
beings are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of power. This idea, then, is an
idea of reflection, &s;ince it ari&s;es from reflecting on the
operations of our own minds, and on the command
which is exerci&s;ed by will, both over the organs of
the body and faculties of the mind.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall proceed to examine this preten&s;ion; and
fir&s;t with regard to the influence of volition over the
organs of the body. This influence, we may ob&s;erve,
<PB N="104" REF="103">
is a fact, which, like all other natural operations, can
be known only by experience, and can never be
fore&s;een from any apparent energy or power in
the cau&s;e, which connects it with the effect, and ren|ders
the one an in&s;allible con&s;equence of the other.
The motion of our body follows upon the command
of our will. Of this we are every moment con|&s;cious:
But the means, by which this is effected; the
energy, by which the will performs &s;o extraordinary
an operation; of this we are &s;o far from being imme|diately
con&s;cious, that it mu&s;t for ever e&s;cape our mo&s;t
diligent inquiry.</P>
<P>FOR <HI>fir&s;t;</HI> is there any principle in all nature more
my&s;terious than the union of &s;oul with body; by
which a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tance acquires &s;uch an
influence over a material one, that the mo&s;t refined
thought is able to actuate the gro&s;&s;e&s;t matter? Were
we empowered, by a &s;ecret wi&s;h, to remove moun|tains,
or control the planets in their orbit; this exten|&s;ive
authority would not be more extraordinary, nor
more beyond our comprehen&s;ion. But if by con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s
we perceived any power or energy in the will,
we mu&s;t know this power; we mu&s;t know its con|nexion
with the effect; we mu&s;t know the &s;ecret
union of &s;oul and body, and the nature of both the&s;e
&s;ub&s;tances: by which the one is able to operate, in &s;o
many in&s;tances, upon the other.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="104">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> We are not able to move all the organs
of the body with a like authority; tho' we cannot a&s;|&s;ign
any other rea&s;on, be&s;ides experience, for &s;o re|markable
a difference betwixt one and the other.
Why has the will an influence over the tongue and
fingers, and not over the heart or liver? This que&s;|tion
would never embarra&s;s us, were we con&s;cious of a
power in the former ca&s;e, and not in the latter. We
&s;hould then perceive, independent of experience, why
the authority of will over the organs of the body is
circum&s;cribed within &s;uch particular limits. Being in
that ca&s;e fully acquainted with the power or force, by
which it operates, we &s;hould al&s;o know, why its in|fluence
reaches preci&s;ely to &s;uch boundaries, and no
farther.</P>
<P>A MAN, &s;truck &s;uddenly with a pal&s;y in the leg or
arm, or who had newly lo&s;t tho&s;e members, frequently
endeavours, at fir&s;t to move them, and employ them
in their u&s;ual offices. Here he is as much con&s;cious
of power to command &s;uch limbs, as a man in perfect
health is con&s;cious of power to actuate any member
which remains in its natural &s;tate and condition. But
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s never deceives. Con&s;equently, neither
in the one ca&s;e nor in the other, are we ever con&s;cious
of any power. We learn the influence of our will
from experience alone. And experience only teaches
us, how one event con&s;tantly follows another, without
<PB N="106" REF="105">
in&s;tructing us in the &s;ecret connexion, which binds
them together, and renders them in&s;eparable.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> WE learn from anatomy, that the imme|diate
object of power in voluntary motion, is not the
member it&s;elf which is moved, but certain mu&s;cles,
and nerves, and animal &s;pirits, and perhaps, &s;ome|thing
&s;till more minute and more unknown, thro'
which the motion is &s;ucce&s;&s;ively propagated, ere it
reach the member it&s;elf who&s;e motion is the imme|diate
object of volition. Can there be a more certain
proof, that the power, by which this whole operation
is performed, &s;o far from being directly and fully
known by an inward &s;entiment or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, is, to
the la&s;t degree, my&s;terious and unintelligible? Here
the mind wills a certain event: Immediately, another
event, unknown to our&s;elves, and totally different
from that intended, is produced: This event produces
another, equally unknown: Till at la&s;t, thro' a long
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the de&s;ired event is produced. But if the
original power were felt, it mu&s;t be known: Were it
known, its effect mu&s;t al&s;o be known; &s;ince all power
is relative to its effect. And <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> if the effect be
not known, the power cannot be known or felt. How
indeed can we be con&s;cious of a power to move our
limbs, when we have no &s;uch power; but only that to
move certain animal &s;pirits, which, tho' they produce
at la&s;t the motion of our limbs, yet operate in &s;uch a
manner as is wholly beyond our comprehen&s;ion?</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="106">
WE may, therefore, conclude from the whole, I
hope, without any temerity, tho' with a&s;&s;urance; that
our idea of power is not copied from any &s;entiment or
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of power within our&s;elves, when we give
ri&s;e to animal motion, or apply our limbs to their
proper u&s;e and office. That their motion follows the
command of the will is a matter of common expe|rience,
like other natural events: But the power or
energy, by which this is effected, like that in other
natural events, is unknown and inconceivable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be pretended, that the re&s;i&s;tance which we meet with in bodies, obliging us frequently to exert our force, and call up all our power, this gives us the idea of force and power. 'Tis this <HI>ni&s;us</HI> or &s;trong endeavour, of which we are con&s;cious, that is the original impre&s;&s;ion from which this idea is copied. But, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> we attribute power to a va&s;t number of objects, where we never can &s;uppo&s;e this re&s;i&s;tance or exertion of force to take place; to the Supreme Being, who never meets with any re&s;i&s;|tance; to the mind in its command over its ideas and limbs, in common thinking and motion, where the effect follows imme|diately upon the will, without any exertion or &s;ummoning up of force; to inanimate matter, which is not capable of this &s;enti|ment. <HI>Secondly,</HI> This &s;entiment of an endeavour to overcome re&s;i&s;tance has no known connexion with any event: What fol|lows it, we know by experience; but could not know it <HI>&agrave; priori.</HI> It mu&s;t, however, be confe&s;&s;ed, that the animal <HI>ni&s;us,</HI> which we experience, tho' it can afford no accurate preci&s;e idea of power, enters very much into that vulgar, inaccurate idea, which is formed of it. See p. 121.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SHALL We then a&s;&s;ert, that we are con&s;cious of a
power or energy in our own minds, when, by an act
<PB N="108" REF="107">
or command of our will, we rai&s;e up a new idea, fix
the mind to a contemplation of it, turn it on all &s;ides,
and at la&s;t di&s;mi&s;s it for &s;ome other idea, when we
think, that we have &s;urveyed it with &s;ufficient accu|racy?
I believe the &s;ame arguments will prove, that
even this command of the will gives us no real idea of
force or energy.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> IT mu&s;t be allowed, that when we know a
power, we know that very circum&s;tance in the cau&s;e,
by which it is enabled to produce the effect: For
the&s;e are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ynonimous. We mu&s;t,
therefore, know both the cau&s;e and effect, and the re|lation
between them. But do we pretend to be ac|quainted
with the nature of the human &s;oul and the
nature of an idea, or the aptitude of the one to pro|duce
the other? This is a real creation; a production
of &s;omething out of nothing: Which implies a power
&s;o great, that it may &s;eem, at fir&s;t &s;ight, beyond the
reach of any being, le&s;s than infinite. At lea&s;t it mu&s;t
be owned, that &s;uch a power is not felt, nor known,
nor even conceivable by the mind. We only feel the
event, <HI>viz.</HI> The exi&s;tence of an idea, confequent to a
command of the will: But the manner, in which this
operation is performed; the power, by which it is pro|duced;
is intirely beyond our comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THE command of the mind over it&s;elf is
limited, as well as its command over the body; and
<PB N="109" REF="108">
the&s;e limits are not known by rea&s;on, or any acquaint|ance
with the nature of the cau&s;e and effect; but on|ly
by experience and ob&s;ervation, as in all other na|tural
events and in the operation of external objects.
Our authority over our &s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions is
much weaker than that over our ideas; and even the
latter authority is circum&s;cribed within very narrow
boundaries. Will any one pretend to a&s;&s;ign the ulti|mate
rea&s;on of the&s;e boundaries, or &s;how why the
power is deficient in one ca&s;e and not in another?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THIS &s;elf-command is very different at
different times. A man in health po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more of
it, than one langui&s;hing with &s;ickne&s;s. We are more
ma&s;ter of our thoughts in the morning than in the
evening: Fa&s;ting, than after a full meal. Can we
give any rea&s;on for the&s;e variations, except experience?
Where then is the power, of which we pretend to be
con&s;cious? Is there not here, either in a &s;piritual or
material &s;ub&s;tance, or both, &s;ome &s;ecret mechani&s;m or
&s;tructure of parts, upon which the effect depends, and
which being intirely unknown to us, renders the pow|er
or energy of the will equally unknown and incom|prehen&s;ible?</P>
<P>VOLITION
is &s;urely an act of the mind, with which
we are &s;ufficiently acquainted. Reflect upon it. Con|&s;ider
it on all &s;ides. Do you find any thing in it like
this creative power, by which it rai&s;es from nothing a
<PB N="110" REF="109">
new idea, and with a kind of FIAT, imitates the omni|potence
of its Maker, if I may be allowed &s;o to &s;peak,
who called forth into exi&s;tence all the various &s;cenes
of nature? So far from being con&s;cious of this energy
in the will, it requires as certain experience, as that of
which we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to convince us, that &s;uch ex|traordinary
effects do ever re&s;ult from a &s;imple act of
volition.</P>
<P>THE generality of mankind never find any diffi|culty
in accounting for the more common and familiar
operations of nature; &s;uch as the de&s;cent of heavy
bodies, the growth of plants, the generation of ani|mals,
or the nouri&s;hment of bodies by food: But &s;up|po&s;e,
that, in all the&s;e ca&s;es, they perceive the very
force or energy of the cau&s;e, by which it is connected
with its effect, and is for ever infallible in its opera|tion.
They acquire, by long habit, &s;uch a turn of
mind, that, upon the appearance of the cau&s;e, they
immediately expect with a&s;&s;urance its u&s;ual attendant,
and hardly conceive it po&s;&s;ible, that any other event
could re&s;ult from it. 'Tis only on the di&s;covery of
extraordinary phaenomena, &s;uch as earthquakes, pe&s;|tilence,
and prodigies of any kind, that they find
them&s;elves at a lo&s;s to a&s;&s;ign a proper cau&s;e, and to ex|plain
the manner in which the effect is produced by
it. 'Tis u&s;ual for men, in &s;uch difficulties, to have
recour&s;e to &s;ome invi&s;ible, intelligent principle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>, as
<PB N="111" REF="110">
the immediate cau&s;e of that event, which &s;urpri&s;es
them, and which, they think, cannot be accounted
for from the common powers of nature. But philo|&s;ophers,
who carry their &s;crutiny a little farther, im|mediately
perceive, that, even in the mo&s;t familiar
events, the energy of the cau&s;e is as unintelligible as
in the mo&s;t unu&s;ual, and that we only learn by expe|rience
the frequent CONJUNCTION of objects, with|out
being ever able to comprehend any thing like
CONNEXION between them. Here then, many philo|&s;ophers
think them&s;elves obliged by rea&s;on to have
recour&s;e, on all occa&s;ions, to the &s;ame principle, which
the vulgar never appeal to but in ca&s;es, that appear
miraculous and &s;upernatural. They acknowledge
mind and intelligence to be, not only the ultimate
and original cau&s;e of all things, but the immediate
and &s;ole cau&s;e of every event, which appears in na|ture.
They pretend, that tho&s;e objects, which are
commonly denominated <HI>cau&s;es,</HI> are in reality nothing
but <HI>occa&s;ions;</HI> and that the true and direct principle of
every effect is not any power or force in nature, but a
volition of the Supreme Being, who wills, that &s;uch
particular objects &s;hould, for ever, be conjoined with
each other. In&s;tead of &s;aying, that one billiard-ball
moves another, by a force which it has derived from
the author of nature; 'tis the Deity him&s;elf, they &s;ay,
who, by a particular volition, moves the &s;econd ball,
being determined to this operation by the impul&s;e of
the fir&s;t ball; in con&s;equence of tho&s;e general laws,
<PB N="112" REF="111">
which he has laid down to him&s;elf in the government
of the univer&s;e. But philo&s;ophers, advancing &s;till in
their inquiries, di&s;cover, that, as we are totally igno|rant
of the power on which depends the mutual ope|ration
of bodies, we are no le&s;s ignorant of that power,
on which depends the operation of mind on body, or
of body on mind; nor are we able, either from our
&s;en&s;es or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, to a&s;&s;ign the ultimate principle
in one ca&s;e, more than in the other. The &s;ame ig|norance,
therefore, reduces them to the &s;ame conclu|&s;ion.
They a&s;&s;ert, that the Deity is the immediate
cau&s;e of the union between &s;oul and body, and that
they are not the organs of &s;en&s;e, which, being agita|ted
by external objects, produce &s;en&s;ations in the
mind; but that 'tis a particular volition of our omni|potent
Maker, which excites &s;uch a &s;en&s;ation, in con|&s;equence
of &s;uch a motion in the organ. In like
manner, it is not any energy in the will, that produ|ces
local motion in our members: 'Tis God him&s;elf,
who is plea&s;ed to &s;econd our will, in it&s;elf impotent,
and to command that motion, which we erroneou&s;ly
attribute to our own power and efficacy. Nor do
philo&s;ophers &s;top at this conclu&s;ion. They &s;ome|times
extend the &s;ame inference to the mind it&s;elf, in
its internal operations. Our mental vi&s;ion or concep|tion
of ideas is nothing but a revelation made to us
by our Maker. When we voluntarily turn our
thoughts to any object, and rai&s;e up its image in the
fancy; it is not the will which creates that idea;
<PB N="113" REF="112">
'Tis the univer&s;al Creator of all things, who di&s;covers
it to the mind, and renders it pre&s;ent to us.</P>
<P>THUS, according to the&s;e philo&s;ophers, every thing
is full of God. Not contented with the principle,
that nothing exi&s;ts but by his will, that nothing po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
any power but by his conce&s;&s;ion: They rob na|ture,
and all created beings, of every power, in order
to render their dependance on the Deity &s;till more
&s;en&s;ible and immediate. They con&s;ider not, that by
this theory they dimini&s;h, in&s;tead of magnifying, the
grandeur of tho&s;e attributes, which they affect &s;o
much to celebrate. It argues &s;urely more power in
the Deity to delegate a certain degree of power to in|ferior
creatures, than to operate every thing by his
own immediate volition. It argues more wi&s;dom to
contrive at fir&s;t the fabric of the world with &s;uch per|fect
fore&s;ight, that, of it&s;elf, and by its proper opera|tion,
it may &s;erve all the purpo&s;es of providence, than
if the great Creator were obliged every moment to ad|ju&s;t
its parts, and animate by his breath all the wheels
of that &s;tupendous machine.</P>
<P>BUT if we would have a more a philo&s;ophical confu|tation
of this theory, perhaps the two following re|flections
may &s;uffice.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> IT &s;eems to me, that this theory of the uni|ver&s;al
energy and operation of the Supreme Being, is
<PB N="114" REF="113">
too bold ever to carry conviction with it to a man who
is &s;ufficiently apprized of the weakne&s;s of human rea&s;on,
and the narrow limits, to which it is confined in all its
operations. Tho' the chain of arguments, which
conduct to it, were ever &s;o logical, there mu&s;t ari&s;e a
&s;trong &s;u&s;picion, if not an ab&s;olute a&s;&s;urance, that it
has carried us quite beyond the reach of our faculties,
when it leads to conclu&s;ions &s;o extraordinary, and &s;o
remote from common life and experience. We are
got into fairy land, long ere we have reached the la&s;t
&s;teps of our theory; and <HI>there</HI> we have no rea&s;on to
tru&s;t our common methods of argument, or think that
our u&s;ual analogies and probabilities have any autho|rity.
Our line is too &s;hort to fathom &s;uch immen&s;e
aby&s;&s;es. And however we may flatter our&s;elves, that
we are guided, in every &s;tep which we take, by a kind
of veri&s;imilitude and experience; we may be a&s;&s;ured,
that this fancied experience has no authority when we
thus apply it to &s;ubjects that lie intirely out of the
&s;phere of experience. But on this we &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion
to touch afterwards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Section XII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I cannot perceive any force in the argu|ments
on which this theory is founded. We are ig|norant,
tis true, of the manner in which bodies ope|rate
on each other: Their force or energy is intirely
incomprehen&s;ible. But are we not equally ignorant
of the manner or force, by which a mind, even the
<PB N="115" REF="114">
&s;upreme mind, operates either on it&s;elf or on body?
Whence, I be&s;eech you, do we acquire any idea of it?
We have no &s;entiment or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this power
in our&s;elves. We have no idea of the Supreme Being
but what we learn from reflection on our own facul|ties.
Were our ignorance, therefore, a good rea&s;on
for rejecting any thing, we &s;hould be led into that
principle of denying all energy in the Supreme Being
as much as in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t matter. We &s;urely com
prehend as little the operations of one as of the other.
Is it more difficult to conceive, that motion may
ari&s;e from impul&s;e, than that it may ari&s;e from voli|tion?
All we know is our profound ignorance in both
ca&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I need not examine at length the <HI>vis inertiae</HI> which is &s;o much talked of in the new philo&s;ophy, and which is a&s;cribed to matter. We find by experience, that a body at re&s;t or in mo|tion continues for ever in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, till put from it by &s;ome new cau&s;e: And that a body impelled takes as much motion from the impelling body as it acquires it&s;elf. The&s;e are facts. When we call this a <HI>vis inertiae,</HI> we only mark the&s;e facts, without pretending to have any idea of the inert power; in the &s;ame manner as, when we talk of gravity, we mean certain effects, without comprehending that active power. It was never the meaning of Sir ISAAC NEWTON to rob &s;econd cau&s;es of all force or energy; tho' &s;ome of his followers have endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h that theory upon his authority. On the contrary, that great philo&s;opher had recour&s;e to an etherial ac|tive fluid to explain his univer&s;al attraction; tho' he was &s;o cautious and mode&s;t as to allow, that it was a mere hypothe&s;is, not to be in&s;i&s;ted on, without more experiments. I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, that there is &s;omething in the fate of opinions a little ex|traordinary. DES-CARTES in&s;inuated that doctrine of the uni|ver&s;al and &s;ole efficacy of the Deity, without in&s;i&s;ting on it. MALEERANCHE and other CARTESIANS made it the foun|dation of all their philo&s;ophy. It had, however, no authority in ENGLAND. LOCKE, CLARKE, and CUDWORTH, never &s;o much as take notice of it, but &s;uppo&s;ed all along, that matter has a real, tho' &s;ubordinate and derived power. By what means has it become &s;o prevalent among our modern metaphy|&s;icians?</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="115">
BUT to ha&s;ten to a conclu&s;ion of this argument,
which is already drawn out to too great a length:
We have &s;ought in vain for an idea of power or nece&s;|&s;ary
connexion, in all the &s;ources from which we could
&s;uppo&s;e it to be derived. It appears, that, in &s;ingle
in&s;tances of the operation of bodies, we never can, by
our utmo&s;t &s;crutiny, di&s;cover any thing but one event
following another; without being able to comprehend
any force or power, by which the cau&s;e operates, or
any connexion between it and its &s;uppo&s;ed effect.
The &s;ame difficulty occurs in contemplating the ope|rations
of mind on body; where we ob&s;erve the mo|tion
of the latter to follow upon the volition of the
former; but are not able to ob&s;erve nor conceive the
<PB N="117" REF="116">
tye, which binds together the motion and volition, or
the energy by which the mind produces this effect.
The authority of the will over its own faculties and
ideas is not a whit more comprehen&s;ible: So that,
upon the whole, there appears not, thro' all nature,
any one in&s;tance of connexion, which is conceivable
by us. All events &s;eem intirely loo&s;e and &s;eparate.
One event follows another; but we never can ob&s;erve
any tye between them. They &s;eem <HI>conjoined,</HI> but
never <HI>connected.</HI> And as we can have no idea of any
thing, which never appeared to our outward &s;en&s;e or
inward &s;entiment, the nece&s;&s;ary conclu&s;ion <HI>&s;eems</HI> to be,
that we have no idea of connexion or power at all,
and that the&s;e words are ab&s;olutely without any mean|ing,
when employed either in philo&s;ophical rea&s;on|ings,
or common life.</P>
<P>BUT there &s;till remains one method of avoiding this
conclu&s;ion, and one &s;ource which we have not yet ex|amined.
When any natural object or event is pre|&s;ented,
'tis impo&s;&s;ible for us, by any &s;agacity or pe|netration,
to di&s;cover, or even conjecture, without ex|perience,
what event will re&s;ult from it, or to carry
our fore&s;ight beyond that object, which is immediate|ly
pre&s;ent to the memory and &s;en&s;es. Even after one
in&s;tance or experiment, where we have ob&s;erved a
particular event to follow upon another, we are not
intitled to form a general rule, or foretel what will
happen in like ca&s;es; it being ju&s;tly e&s;teemed an un|pardonable
<PB N="118" REF="117">
temerity to judge of the whole cour&s;e of
nature from one &s;ingle experiment, however accurate
or certain. But when one particular &s;pecies of event
has always, in all in&s;tances, been conjoined with ano|ther,
we make no longer any &s;cruple to foretel the
one upon the appearance of the other, and to employ
that rea&s;oning, which can alone a&s;&s;ure us of any mat|ter
of fact or exi&s;tence. We then call the one object,
<HI>Cau&s;e;</HI> and the other, <HI>Effect.</HI> We &s;uppo&s;e, that there
is &s;ome connexion between them; &s;ome power in the
one, by which it infallibly produces the other, and o|perates
with the greate&s;t certainty and &s;tronge&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>IT
appears, then, that this idea of a nece&s;&s;ary con|nexion
from events ari&s;es from a number of &s;imilar
in&s;tances, which occur, of the con&s;tant conjunction of
the&s;e events; nor can that idea ever be &s;ugge&s;ted by
any one of the&s;e in&s;tances, &s;urveyed in all po&s;&s;ible
lights and po&s;itions. But there is nothing in a num|ber
of in&s;tances, different from every &s;ingle in&s;tance,
which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be exactly &s;imilar; except only,
that after a repetition of &s;imilar in&s;tances, the mind is
carried by habit, upon the appearance of one event, to
expect its u&s;ual attendant, and to believe, that it will
exi&s;t. This connexion, therefore, which we <HI>feel</HI> in
the mind, or cu&s;tomary tran&s;ition of the imagination
from one object to its u&s;ual attendant, is the &s;enti|ment
or impre&s;&s;ion, from which we form the idea of
<PB N="119" REF="118">
power or nece&s;&s;ary connexion. Nothing farther is in
the ca&s;e. Contemplate the &s;ubject on all &s;ides, you
will never find any other origin of this idea. This is
the &s;ole difference between one in&s;tance, from which
we never can receive the idea of connexion, and a
number of &s;imilar in&s;tances, by which it is &s;ugge&s;ted.
The fir&s;t time a man &s;aw the communication of mo|tion
by impul&s;e, as by the &s;hock of two billiard balls,
he could not pronounce that the one event was <HI>con|nected;</HI>
but only that it was <HI>conjoined</HI> with the other.
After he has ob&s;erved &s;everal in&s;tances of this nature,
he then pronounces them to be <HI>connected.</HI> What al|teration
has happened to give ri&s;e to this new idea of
<HI>connexion?</HI> Nothing but that he now <HI>feels</HI> the&s;e events
to be <HI>connected</HI> in his imagination, and can readily
foretel the exi&s;tence of one from the appearance of
the other. When we &s;ay, therefore, that one object
is connected with another, we mean only, that they
have acquired a connexion in our thoughts, and give
ri&s;e to this inference, by which they become proofs
of each other's exi&s;tence: A conclu&s;ion; which is
&s;omewhat extraordinary; but which &s;eems founded
on &s;ufficient evidence. Nor will its evidence be
weakned by any general diffidence of the under|&s;tanding,
or &s;ceptical &s;u&s;picion concerning every con|clu&s;ion,
which is new and extraordinary. No con|clu&s;ions
can be more agreeable to &s;ceptici&s;m than &s;uch
as make di&s;coveries concerning the weakne&s;s and nar|row
limits of human rea&s;on and capacity.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="119">
AND what &s;tronger in&s;tance can be produced of the
&s;urpri&s;ing ignorance and weakne&s;s of the under&s;tand|ing,
than the pre&s;ent? For &s;urely, if there be any re|lation
among objects, which it imports us to know
perfectly, 'tis that of cau&s;e and effect. On this are
founded all our rea&s;onings concerning matter of fact
or exi&s;tence. By means of it alone we attain any a&s;|&s;urance
concerning objects which are removed from
the pre&s;ent te&s;timony of our memory and &s;en&s;es.
The only immediate utility of all &s;ciences, is to teach
us, how to control and regulate future events by their
cau&s;es. Our thoughts and inquiries are, therefore,
every moment, employed about this relation. And
yet &s;o imperfect are the ideas which we form concern|ing
it, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to give any ju&s;t definition
of cau&s;e, except what is drawn from &s;omething extra|neous
and foreign to it. Similar objects are always
conjoined with &s;imilar. Of this we have experience.
Suitable to this experience, therefore, we may define a
cau&s;e to be <HI>an object, followed by another, and where
all the objects, &s;imilar to the fir&s;t, are followed by ob|jects
&s;imilar to the &s;econd.</HI> Or in other words, <HI>where,
if the fir&s;t object had not been, the &s;econd never had ex|i&s;ted.</HI>
The appearance of a cau&s;e always conveys the
mind, by a cu&s;tomary tran&s;ition, to the idea of the ef|fect.
Of this al&s;o we have experience. We may,
therefore, &s;uitable to this experience, form another de|finition
of cau&s;e, and call it, <HI>an object followed by an|other,
and who&s;e appearance always conveys the thought
<PB N="121" REF="120">
to that other.</HI> But tho' both the&s;e definitions be
drawn from circum&s;tances foreign to the cau&s;e, we
cannot remedy this inconvenience, or attain any
more perfect definition, which may point out that
circum&s;tance in the cau&s;e, which gives it a connexion
with its effect. We have no idea of this connexion;
nor even any di&s;tinct notion what it is we de&s;ire to
know, when we endeavour at a conception of it. We
&s;ay, for in&s;tance, that the vibration of this &s;tring is the
cau&s;e of this particular &s;ound. But what do we mean
by that affirmation? We either mean, <HI>that this vibra|tion
is followed by this &s;ound, and that all &s;imilar vibra|tions
have been followed by &s;imilar &s;ounds: Or, that
this vibration is followed by this &s;ound, and that upon
the appearance of one, the mind anticipates the &s;en&s;es,
and forms immediately an idea of the other.</HI> We may
con&s;ider the relation of cau&s;e and effect in either of
the&s;e two lights; but beyond the&s;e, we have no idea
of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>According to the&s;e explications and definitions, the idea of <HI>power</HI> is relative as much as that of <HI>cau&s;e;</HI> and both have a re|ference to an effect, or &s;ome other event con&s;tantly conjoined with the former. When we con&s;ider the <HI>unknown</HI> circum&s;tance of an object, by which the degree or quantity of its effect is fixed and determined, we call that its power: And accordingly, 'tis allowed by all philo&s;ophers, that the effect is the mea&s;ure of the power. But if they had any idea of power, as it is in it|&s;elf, why could not they mea&s;ure it in it&s;elf? The di&s;pute whether the force of a body in motion be as its velocity, or the &s;quare of its velocity; this di&s;pute, I &s;ay, needed not be decided by comparing its effects in equal or unequal times; but by a di|rect men&s;uration and compari&s;on.</P>
<P>As to the frequent u&s;e of the words, Force, Power, Energy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which every where occur in common conver&s;ation, as well as in philo&s;ophy; that is no proof, that we are acquainted, in any in&s;tance, with the connecting principle between cau&s;e and effect, or can account ultimately for the production of one thing by another. The&s;e words, as commonly u&s;ed, have very loo&s;e meanings annexed to them; and their ideas are very un|certain and confu&s;ed. No animal can put external bodies in motion without the &s;entiment of a <HI>ni&s;us</HI> or endeavour; and every animal has a &s;entiment or feeling from the &s;troke or blow of an external object, that is in motion. The&s;e &s;en&s;ations, which are merely animal, and from which we can <HI>&agrave; priori</HI> draw no inference, we are apt to transfer to inanimate objects, and to &s;uppo&s;e, that they have &s;ome &s;uch feelings, whenever they transfer or receive motion. With regard to energies, which are exerted, without our annexing to them any idea of commu|nicated motion, we con&s;ider only the con&s;tant experienced con|junction of the events; and as we <HI>feel</HI> a cu&s;tomary connexion between the ideas, we transfer that feeling to the objects; as nothing is more u&s;ual than to apply to external bodies every in|ternal &s;en&s;ation, which they occa&s;ion.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="121">
To recapitulate, therefore, the rea&s;onings of this
&s;ection: Every idea is copied from &s;ome preceding
impre&s;&s;ion or &s;entiment; and where we cannot find
any impre&s;&s;ion, we may be certain that there is no
idea. In all &s;ingle in&s;tances of the operation of bodies
<PB N="123" REF="122">
or minds, there is nothing that produces any impre&s;|&s;ion,
nor con&s;equently can &s;ugge&s;t any idea of power
or nece&s;&s;ary connexion. But when many uniform in|&s;tances
appear, and the &s;ame object is always follow|ed
by the &s;ame event; we then begin to entertain the
notion of cau&s;e and connexion. We then <HI>feel</HI> a new
&s;entiment or impre&s;&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> a cu&s;tomary connexion
in the thought or imagination between one object and
its u&s;ual attendant; and this &s;entiment is the original
of that idea which we &s;eek for. For as this idea ari&s;es
from a number of &s;imilar in&s;tances, and not from any
&s;ingle in&s;tance; it mu&s;t ari&s;e from that circum&s;tance,
in which the number of in&s;tances differ from every in|dividual
in&s;tance. But this cu&s;tomary connexion or
tran&s;ition of the imagination is the only circum&s;tance,
in which they differ. In every other particular they
are alike. The fir&s;t in&s;tance which we &s;aw of motion,
communicated by the &s;hock of two billiard-balls (to re|turn
to this obvious in&s;tance) is exactly &s;imilar to any
in&s;tance that may, at pre&s;ent, occur to us; except on|ly,
that we could not, at fir&s;t, <HI>infer</HI> one event from the
other; which we are enabled to do at pre&s;ent, after &s;o
long a cour&s;e of uniform experience. I know not, if
the reader will readily apprehend this rea&s;oning. I
am afraid, that, &s;hould I multiply words about it, or
throw it into a greater variety of lights, it would only
become more ob&s;cure and intricate. In all ab&s;tract
rea&s;onings, there is one point of view, which, if we
<PB N="124" REF="123">
can happily hit, we &s;hall go farther towards illu&s;trating
the &s;ubject, than by all the eloquence and copious
expre&s;&s;ion in the world. This we &s;hould endeavour
to attain, and re&s;erve the flowers of rhetoric for &s;ub|jects,
which are more adapted to them.</P>

<P>IT might rea&s;onably be expected, in que&s;tions,
which have been canva&s;&s;ed and di&s;puted with great
eagerne&s;s &s;ince the fir&s;t origin of &s;cience and philo&s;o|phy,
that the meaning of all the terms, at lea&s;t,
&s;hould have been agreed upon among the di&s;putants;
and our enquiries, in the cour&s;e of two thou&s;and years,
been able to pa&s;s from words to the true and real &s;ub|ject
of the controver&s;y. For how ea&s;y may it &s;eem to
give exact definitions of the terms employed in rea&s;on|ing,
and make the&s;e definitions, not the mere &s;ound of
words, the object of future &s;crutiny and examination?
But if we con&s;ider the matter more narrowly, we &s;hall
be apt to draw a quite oppo&s;ite conclu&s;ion. From
that circum&s;tance alone, that a controver&s;y has been
long kept on foot, and remains &s;till undecided, we
may pre&s;ume, that there is &s;ome ambiguity in the ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
and that the di&s;putants affix different ideas
<PB N="126" REF="125">
to the terms employed in the controver&s;y. For as the
faculties of the &s;oul are &s;uppo&s;ed to be naturally alike
in every individual; otherwi&s;e nothing could be more
fruitle&s;s than to rea&s;on or di&s;pute together; it were
impo&s;&s;ible, if men affix the &s;ame ideas to their terms,
that they could &s;o long form different opinions of the
&s;ame &s;ubject; e&s;pecially when they communicate their
views, and each party turn them&s;elves on all &s;ides, in
&s;earch of arguments, which may give them the vic|tory
over their antagoni&s;ts. 'Tis ture; if men at|tempt
the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of que&s;tions, which lie entirely
beyond the reach of human capacity, &s;uch as tho&s;e
concerning the origin of worlds, or the oeconomy of
the intellectual &s;y&s;tem or region of &s;pirits, they may
long beat the air in their fruitle&s;s conte&s;ts, and never
arrive at any determinate conclu&s;ion. But if the
que&s;tion regard any &s;ubject of common life and expe|rience;
nothing, one would think, could pre&s;erve
the di&s;pute &s;o long undecided, but &s;ome ambiguous
expre&s;&s;ions, which keep the antagoni&s;ts &s;till at a di&s;|tance,
and hinder them from grappling with each
other.</P>
<P>THIS has been the ca&s;e in the long di&s;puted que&s;|tion
concerning liberty and nece&s;&s;ity; and to &s;o re|markable
a degree, that, if I be not much mi&s;taken,
we &s;hall find all mankind, both learned and ignorant,
to have been always of the &s;ame opinion with regard
to that &s;ubject, and that a few intelligible definitions
<PB N="127" REF="126">
would immediately have put an end to the whole
controver&s;y. I own, that this di&s;pute has been &s;o
much canva&s;&s;ed, on all hands, and has led philo&s;o|phers
into &s;uch a labyrinth of ob&s;cure &s;ophi&s;try, that
'tis no wonder if a &s;en&s;ible and polite reader indulge
his ea&s;e &s;o far as to turn a deaf ear to the propo&s;al
of &s;uch a que&s;tion, from which he can expect neither
in&s;truction nor entertainment. But the &s;tate of the
argument here propo&s;ed may, perhaps, &s;erve to re|new
his attention; as it has more novelty, promi&s;es
at lea&s;t &s;ome deci&s;ion of the controver&s;y, and will not
much di&s;turb his ea&s;e, by any intricate or ob&s;cure
rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>I HOPE, therefore, to make it appear, that all men
have ever agreed in the doctrines both of nece&s;&s;ity and
of liberty, according to any rea&s;onable &s;en&s;e, which
can be put on the&s;e terms; and that the whole con|trover&s;y
has hitherto turned merely upon words. We
&s;hall begin with examining the doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>'TIS univer&s;ally allowed, that matter, in all its
operations, is actuated by a nece&s;&s;ary force, and that
every natural effect is &s;o preci&s;ely determined by the
energy of its cau&s;e, that no other effect, in &s;uch
particular circum&s;tances, could po&s;&s;ibly have re&s;ulted
from the operation of that cau&s;e. The degree and
direction of every motion is, by the laws of nature,
pre&s;cribed with &s;uch exactne&s;s, that a living creature
<PB N="128" REF="127">
may as &s;oon ari&s;e from the &s;hock of two bodies, as
motion in any other degree or direction, than what is
actually produced by it Would we, therefore, form
a ju&s;t and preci&s;e idea of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> we mu&s;t con&s;ider,
whence that idea ari&s;es, when we apply it to the ope|ration
of bodies.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems evident, that, if all the &s;cenes of nature
were &s;hifted continually in &s;uch a manner, that no
two events bore any re&s;emblance to each other, but
every object was entirely new, without any &s;imilitude
to whatever had been &s;een before, we &s;hould never,
in that ca&s;e, have attained the lea&s;t idea of nece&s;&s;ity,
or of a connexion among the&s;e objects. We might
&s;ay, upon &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, that one object or event
has followed another; not that one was produced by
the other. The relation of cau&s;e and effect mu&s;t be
utterly unknown to mankind. Inference and rea&s;on|ing
concerning the operations of nature would, from
that moment, be at an end; and the memory and
&s;en&s;es remain the only canals, by which the know|lege
of any real exi&s;tence could po&s;&s;ibly have acce&s;s to
the mind. Our idea, therefore, of nece&s;&s;ity and cau|&s;ation
ari&s;es entirely from that uniformity, ob&s;ervable
in the operations of nature; where &s;imilar objects are
con&s;tantly conjoined together, and the mind is deter|mined
by cu&s;tom to infer the one from the appear|ance
of the other. The&s;e two circum&s;tances form
the whole of that nece&s;&s;ity, which we a&s;cribe to mat|ter.
<PB N="129" REF="128">
Beyond the con&s;tant <HI>conjunction</HI> of &s;imilar ob|jects,
and the con&s;equent <HI>inference</HI> from one to the
other, we have no notion of any nece&s;&s;ity, or con|nexion.</P>
<P>IF
it appear, therefore, that all mankind have ever
allowed, without any doubt or he&s;itation, that the&s;e
two circum&s;tances take place in the voluntary actions
of men, and in the operations of the mind; it mu&s;t
follow, that all mankind have ever agreed in the doc|trine
of nece&s;&s;ity, and that they have hitherto di&s;|puted,
merely for not under&s;tanding each other.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t circum&s;tance, the con&s;tant and regular
conjunction of &s;imilar events; we may po&s;&s;ibly &s;atisfy
our&s;elves by the following con&s;iderations. It is uni|ver&s;ally
acknowledged, that there is a great uniformity
among the actions of men, in all nations and ages,
and that human nature remains &s;till the &s;ame, in its
principles and operations. The &s;ame motives produce
always the &s;ame actions: The &s;ame events follow
from the &s;ame cau&s;es. Ambition, avarice, &s;elf love,
vanity, friend&s;hip, genero&s;ity, public &s;pirit; the&s;e
pa&s;&s;ions, mixed in various degrees, and di&s;tributed
thro' &s;ociety, have been, from the beginning of the
world, and &s;till are, the &s;ources of all the actions and

mankind. Would you know the &s;entiments, incli|nations,

of experiments, by which the politician or
moral philo&s;opher fixes the principles of his &s;cience;
in the &s;ame manner as the phy&s;ician or natural philo|&s;opher
becomes acquainted with the nature of plants,
minerals, and other external objects, by the experi|ments,
which he forms concerning them. Nor are
the earth, water, and other elements, examined by
ARISTOTLE, and HIPPOCRATES, more like to tho&s;e,
which at pre&s;ent lie under our ob&s;ervation, than the
men, de&s;cribed by POLYBIUS and TACITUS, are to
tho&s;e who now govern the world.</P>
<P>SHOULD a traveller, returning from a far country,
bring us an account of men, entirely different from
any, with whom we were ever acquainted; men, who
<PB N="131" REF="130">
were entirely dive&s;ted of avarice, ambition, or re|venge;
who knew no plea&s;ure but friend&s;hip, gene|ro&s;ity,
and publick &s;pirit; we &s;hould immediately,
from the&s;e circum&s;tances, detect the fal&s;hood, and
prove him a liar, with the &s;ame certainty as if he
had &s;tuffed his narration with &s;tories of centaurs and
dragons, miracles and prodigies. And if we would
explode any forgery in hi&s;tory, we cannot make u&s;e
of a more convincing argument; than to prove, that
the actions, a&s;cribed to any per&s;on, are directly con|trary
to the cour&s;e of nature, and that no human mo|tives,
in &s;uch circum&s;tances, could ever induce him
to &s;uch a conduct. The veracity of QUINTUS CUR|TIUS
is as &s;u&s;picious, when he de&s;cribes the &s;uperna|tural
courage of ALEXANDER, by which he was hur|ried
on &s;ingly to attack multitudes, as when he de|&s;cribes
his &s;upernatural force and activity, by which
he was able to re&s;i&s;t them. So readily and univer|&s;ally
do we acknowlege an uniformity in human mo|tives
and actions as well as in the operations of
body.</P>
<P>HENCE likewi&s;e the benefit of that experience, ac|quired
by long life and a variety of bu&s;ine&s;s and com|pany,
in order to in&s;truct us in the principles of hu|man
nature, and regulate our future conduct, as well
as &s;peculation. By means of this guide, we mount
up to the knowlege of mens inclinations and motives,
from their actions, expre&s;&s;ions, and even ge&s;tures;
<PB N="132" REF="131">
and again, de&s;cend to the interpretation of their ac|tions
from our knowlege of their motives and inclina|tions.
The general ob&s;ervations, trea&s;ured up by a
cour&s;e of experience, give us the clue of human na|ture,
and teaches us to unravel all its intricacies. Pre|texts
and appearances no longer deceive us. Public
declarations pa&s;s for the &s;pecious colouring of a cau&s;e.
And tho' virtue and honour be allowed their proper
weight and authority, that perfect di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, &s;o
often pretended, is never expected in multitudes and
parties; &s;eldom in their leaders; and &s;carcely even in
individuals of any rank or &s;tation. But were there no
uniformity in human actions, and were every experi|ment
which we could form of this kind irregular and
anomolous, it were impo&s;&s;ible to collect any general
ob&s;ervations concerning mankind; and no experience,
however accurately dige&s;ted by reflection, would ever
&s;erve to any purpo&s;e. Why is the antient hu&s;band|man
more &s;kilful in his calling than the young be|ginner,
but becau&s;e there is a certain uniformity in
the operation of the &s;un, rain, and earth, towards
the production of vegetables; and experience teaches
the old practitioner the rules, by which this operation
is governed and directed?</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t not, however, expect, that this unifor|mity
of human actions &s;hould be carried to &s;uch a
length, as that all men in the &s;ame circum&s;tances,
&s;hould always act preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner, with|out
<PB N="133" REF="132">
any allowance for the diver&s;ity of characters, pre|judices,
and opinions. Such a uniformity, in every
particular is found in no part of nature. On the con|trary,
from ob&s;erving the variety of conduct in diffe|rent
men, we are enabled to form a greater variety of
maxims, which &s;till &s;uppo&s;e a degree of uniformity
and regularity.</P>
<P>ARE the manners of men different in different ages
and countries? We learn thence the great force of
cu&s;tom and education, which mould the human mind
from its infancy, and form it into a fixed and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
character. Is the behaviour and conduct of
the one &s;ex very unlike that of the other? 'Tis from
thence we become acquainted with the different cha|racters,
which nature has impre&s;&s;ed upon the &s;exes,
and which &s;he pre&s;erves with con&s;tancy and regula|rity.
Are the actions of the &s;ame per&s;on much di|ver&s;ified
in the different periods of his life, from in|fancy
to old age? This affords room for many gene|ral
ob&s;ervations concerning the gradual change of our
&s;entiments and inclinations, and the different maxims,
which prevail in the different ages of human crea|tures.
Even the characters which are peculiar to each
individual, have an uniformity in their influence, other|wi&s;e
our acquaintance with the per&s;ons, and our ob|&s;ervation
of their conduct could never teach us their
di&s;po&s;itions, nor &s;erve to direct our behaviour with
regard to them.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="133">
I GRANT it po&s;&s;ible to find &s;ome actions, which
&s;eem to have no regular connexion with any known
motives, and are exceptions to all the mea&s;ures of
conduct, which have ever been e&s;tabli&s;hed for the go|vernment
of men. But if we would willingly know,
what judgment &s;hould be formed of &s;uch irregular
and extraordinary actions; we may con&s;ider the &s;en|timents
that are commonly entertained with regard to
tho&s;e irregular events, which appear in the cour&s;e of
nature, and the operations of external objects. All
cau&s;es are not conjoined to their u&s;ual effects, with
like uniformity. An artificer, who handles only dead
matter, may be di&s;appointed of his aim as well as
the politician, who directs the conduct of &s;en&s;ible and
intelligent agents.</P>
<P>THE vulgar, who take things according to their
fir&s;t appearance, attribute the uncertainty of events to
&s;uch an uncertainty in the cau&s;es as makes the latter
often fail of their u&s;ual influence; tho' they meet
with no impediment in their operation. But philo&s;o|phers,
ob&s;erving, that almo&s;t in every part of nature
there is contained a va&s;t variety of &s;prings and prin|ciples,
which are hid, by rea&s;on of their minutene&s;s
or remotene&s;s, find, that 'tis at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible the con|trariety
of events may not proceed from any contin|gency
in the cau&s;e, but from the &s;ecret operation of
contrary cau&s;es. This po&s;&s;ibility is converted into cer|tainty
by farther ob&s;ervation, when they remark,
<PB N="135" REF="134">
that, upon an exact &s;crutiny, a contrariety of effects
always betrays a contrariety of cau&s;es, and proceeds
from their mutual oppo&s;ition. A pea&s;ant can give
no better rea&s;on for the &s;topping of any clock or
watch than to &s;ay that it commonly does not not go
right: But an artizan ea&s;ily perceives, that the &s;ame
force in the &s;pring or pendulum has always the &s;ame
influence on the wheels; but fails of its u&s;ual effect,
perhaps by rea&s;on of a grain of du&s;t, which puts a
&s;top to the whole movement. From the ob&s;ervation
of &s;everal parallel in&s;tances, philo&s;ophers form a
maxim, that the connexion between all cau&s;es and
effects is equally nece&s;&s;ary, and that its &s;eeming un|certainty
in &s;ome in&s;tances proceeds from the &s;ecret
oppo&s;ition of contrary cau&s;es.</P>
<P>THUS for in&s;tance, in the human body, when the
u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of health or &s;ickne&s;s di&s;appoint our
expectation; when medicines operate not with their
wonted powers; when irregular events follow from
any particular cau&s;es; the philo&s;opher and phy&s;ician
are not &s;urprized at the matter, nor are ever tempted
to deny, in general, the nece&s;&s;ity and uniformity of
tho&s;e principles, by which the animal oeconomy is
conducted. They know, that a human body is a
mighty complicated machine: That many &s;ecret pow|ers
lurk in it, which are altogether beyond our com|prehen&s;ion:
That to us it mu&s;t often appear very un|certain
in its operations: And that therefore the irre|gular
<PB N="136" REF="135">
events, which outwardly di&s;cover them&s;elves,
can be no proof, that the laws of nature are not ob|&s;erved
with the greate&s;t regularity in its internal ope|rations
and government.</P>
<P>THE philo&s;opher, if he be con&s;i&s;tent, mu&s;t apply
the &s;ame rea&s;onings to the actions and volitions of
intelligent agents. The mo&s;t irregular and unex|pected
re&s;olutions of men may frequently be accounted
for by tho&s;e who know every particular circum&s;tance
of their character and &s;ituation. A per&s;on of an
obliging di&s;po&s;ition gives a peevi&s;h an&s;wer: But he
has the tooth-ake, or has not dined. A &s;tupid fel|low
di&s;covers an uncommon alacrity in his carriage:
But he has met with a &s;udden piece of good fortune.
Or even when an action, as &s;ometimes happens, can|not
be particularly accounted for, either by the per|&s;on
him&s;elf or by others; we know, in general, that
the characters of men are, to a certain degree, incon|&s;tant
and irregular. This is, in a manner, the con&s;tant
character of human nature; tho' it be applicable, in
a more particular manner, to &s;ome per&s;ons, who have
no fixed rule for their conduct, but proceed in a con|tinued
cour&s; of caprice and incon&s;tancy. The in|ternal
principles and motives may operate in an uni|form
manner, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e &s;eeming irregu|larities;
in the &s;ame manner as the winds, rain,
clouds, and other variations of the weather are &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="137" REF="136">
to be governed by &s;teady principles; tho' not
ea&s;ily di&s;coverable by human &s;agacity and enquiry.</P>
<P>THUS it appears, not only that the conjunction
between motives and voluntary actions is as regular
and uniform, as that between the cau&s;e and effect in
any part of nature; but al&s;o that this regular conjunc|tion
has been univer&s;ally acknowleged among man|kind,
and has never been the &s;ubject of di&s;pute, ei|ther
in philo&s;ophy or common life. Now as it is
from pa&s;t experience, that we draw all inferences con|cerning
the future, and as we conclude, that objects
will always be conjoined together, which we find al|ways
to have been conjoined; it may &s;eem &s;uperflu|ous
to prove, that this experienced uniformity in
human actions is the &s;ource of all the <HI>inferences,</HI>
which we form concerning them. But in order to
throw the argument into a greater variety of lights,
we &s;hall al&s;o in&s;i&s;t, tho' briefly, on this latter topic.</P>
<P>THE mutual dependance of men is &s;o great, in all
&s;ocieties, that &s;carce any human action is entirely
compleat in it&s;elf, or is performed without &s;ome re|ference
to the actions of others, which are requi&s;ite
to make it an&s;wer fully the intention of the agent.
The poore&s;t artificer, who labours alone, expects at
lea&s;t the protection of the magi&s;trate, to en&s;ure the
enjoyment of the fruits of his labour. He al&s;o ex|pects,
that, when he carries his goods to market, and
<PB N="138" REF="137">
offers them at a rea&s;onable price, he &s;hall find buyers;
and &s;hall be able, by the money he acquires, to en|gage
others to &s;upply him with tho&s;e commodities,
which are requi&s;ite for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In propor|tion
as men extend their dealings, and render their
intercour&s;e with others more complicated, they always
comprehend, in their &s;chemes of life, a greater va|riety
of voluntary actions, which they expect, from
their proper motives, to co-operate with their own.
In all the&s;e conclu&s;ions, they take their mea&s;ures from
pa&s;t experience, in the &s;ame manner as in their rea|&s;onings
concerning external objects: and firmly be|lieve,
that men, as well as all the elements, are to
continue, in their operations, the &s;ame, which they
have ever found them. A manufacturer reckons up|on
the labour of his &s;ervants, for the execution of
any work, as much as upon the tools, which he em|ploys,
and would be equally &s;urprized, were his ex|pectations
di&s;appointed. In &s;hort, this experimental
inference and rea&s;oning concerning the actions of
others enters &s;o much into human life, that no man,
while awake, is ever a moment without employing
it. Have we not rea&s;on, therefore, to affirm, that all
mankind have always agreed in the doctrine of ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
according to the foregoing definition and ex|plication
of it?</P>
<P>NOR have philo&s;ophers ever entertained a different
opinion from the people in this particular. For not
<PB N="139" REF="138">
to mention, that almo&s;t every action of their life &s;up|po&s;es
that opinion; there are even few of the &s;pecu|lative
parts of learning, to which it is not e&s;&s;ential.
What would become of <HI>hi&s;tory,</HI> had we not a depen|dence
on the veracity of the hi&s;torian, according to
the experience, which we have had of mankind? How
could <HI>politics</HI> be a &s;cience, if laws and forms of go|vernment
had not an uniform influence upon &s;ociety?
Where would be the foundation of <HI>morals,</HI> if particu|lar
characters had no certain nor determinate power
to produce particular &s;entiments, and if the&s;e &s;enti|ments
had no con&s;tant operations on actions? And
with what pretext could we employ our <HI>critici&s;m</HI> upon
any poet or polite author, if we could not pronounce
the conduct and &s;entiments of his actors, either natu|ral
or unnatural, to &s;uch characters, and in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances?
It &s;eems almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, therefore,
to engage, either in &s;cience or action of any kind,
without acknowleging the doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity, and
this <HI>inference</HI> from motives to voluntary actions; from
characters to conduct.</P>
<P>AND indeed, when we con&s;ider how aptly <HI>natural</HI>
and <HI>moral</HI> evidence link together, and form only one
chain of argument, we &s;hall make no &s;cruple to al|low,
that they are of the &s;ame nature, and derived
from the &s;ame principles. A pri&s;oner, who has nei|ther
money nor intere&s;t, di&s;covers the impo&s;&s;ibility of
his e&s;cape, as well from the ob&s;tinacy of the gaoler,
<PB N="140" REF="139">
as from the walls and bars, with which he is &s;ur|rounded;
and in all attempts for his freedom, chu&s;es
rather to work upon the &s;tone and iron of the one,
than upon the inflexible nature of the other. The
&s;ame pri&s;oner, when conducted to the &s;caffold, fore&s;ees
his death as certainly from the con&s;tancy and fidelity
of his guards, as from the operation of the ax or
wheel. His mind runs along a certain train of ideas:
The refu&s;al of the &s;oldiers to con&s;ent to his e&s;cape;
the action of the executioner; the &s;eparation of the
head and body; bleeding, convul&s;ive motions, and
death. Here is a connected chain of natural cau&s;es
and voluntary actions; but the mind feels no diffe|rence
between them, in pa&s;&s;ing from one link to
another: Nor is le&s;s certain of the future event than
if it were connected with the objects pre&s;ent to the
memory or &s;en&s;es, by a train of cau&s;es, cemented to|gether
by what we are plea&s;ed to call a <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> nece&s;|&s;ity.
The &s;ame experienced union has the &s;ame effect
on the mind, whether the united objects be motives,
volitions, and actions; or figure and motion. We
may change the names of things; but their nature
and their operation on the under&s;tanding never
change.</P>
<P>I HAVE frequently con&s;idered, what could po&s;&s;ibly
be the rea&s;on, why all mankind, tho' they have ever
without he&s;itation, acknowleged the doctrine of ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
in their whole practice and rea&s;oning, have
<PB N="141" REF="140">
yet di&s;covered &s;uch a reluctance to acknowlege it in
words, and have rather &s;hewn a propen&s;ity, in all
ages, to profe&s;s the contrary opinion. The matter,
I think, may be accounted for, after the following
manner. If we examine the operations of bodies and
the production of effects from their cau&s;es, we &s;hall
find, that all our faculties can never carry us farther
in our knowlege of this relation, than barely to ob|&s;erve,
that particular objects are <HI>con&s;tantly conjoined</HI> to|gether,
and that the mind is carried, by a <HI>cu&s;tomary
tran&s;ition,</HI> from the appearance of one to the belief
of the other. But tho' this conclu&s;ion concerning
human ignorance be the re&s;ult of the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny
of this &s;ubject, men &s;till entertain a &s;trong propen&s;ity
to believe, that they penetrate farther into the powers
of nature, and perceive &s;omething like a nece&s;&s;ary con|nexion
between the cau&s;e and the effect. When again
they turn their reflections towards the operations of
their own minds, and <HI>feel</HI> no &s;uch connexion of the
motive and the action; they are apt, from thence, to
&s;uppo&s;e, that there is a difference between the effects,
re&s;ulting from material force, and tho&s;e which ari&s;e
from thought and intelligence. But being once con|vinced,
that we know nothing farther of cau&s;ation of
any kind, than merely the <HI>con&s;tant conjunction</HI> of ob|jects,
and the con&s;equent <HI>inference</HI> of the mind from
one to another, and finding, that the&s;e two circum|&s;tances
are univer&s;ally acknowleged to have place in
voluntary actions; we may thence be more ea&s;ily led
<PB N="142" REF="141">
to own the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity common to all cau&s;es. And
tho' this rea&s;oning may contradict the &s;y&s;tems of many
philo&s;ophers, in a&s;cribing nece&s;&s;ity to the determinati|ons
of the will, we &s;hall find, upon reflection, that they
di&s;&s;ent from it in words only, not in their real &s;enti|ments.
Nece&s;&s;ity, according to the &s;en&s;e, in which
it is here taken, has never yet been rejected, nor can
ever, I think, be rejected by any philo&s;opher. It may
only, perhaps, be pretended, that the mind can per|ceive,
in the operations of matter, &s;ome farther con|nexion
between the cau&s;e and effect; and a connexion
which has not place in the voluntary actions of in|telligent
beings. Now whether it be &s;o or not, can
only appear upon examination; and it is incumbent
on the&s;e philo&s;ophers to make good their a&s;&s;ertion, by
defining or de&s;cribing that nece&s;&s;ity, and pointing it
out to us, in the operations of material cau&s;es.</P>
<P>IT would &s;eem, indeed, that men begin at the
wrong end of this que&s;tion concerning liberty and ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
when they enter upon it by examining the
faculties of the &s;oul, the influence of the under&s;tand|ing,
and the operations of the will. Let them fir&s;t
di&s;cu&s;s a more &s;imple que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> the operations of
body and of brute unintelligent matter; and try whe|ther
they can there form any idea of cau&s;ation and
nece&s;&s;ity, except that of a con&s;tant conjunction of ob|jects,
and &s;ub&s;equent inference of the mind from one
to another. If the&s;e circum&s;tances form, in reality,
<PB N="143" REF="142">
the whole of that nece&s;&s;ity, which we can conceive
in matter, and if the&s;e circum&s;tances be al&s;o univer|&s;ally
acknowleged to take place in the operations of
the mind, the di&s;pute is at an end; or, at lea&s;t, mu&s;t
be owned to be thenceforth merely verbal. But as
long as we will ra&s;hly &s;uppo&s;e, that we have &s;ome far|ther
idea of nece&s;&s;ity and cau&s;ation in the operations
of external objects; at the &s;ame time, that we can
find nothing farther, in the voluntary actions of the
mind; there is no po&s;&s;ibility of bringing the di&s;pute
to any determinate i&s;&s;ue, while we proceed upon &s;o
erroneous a &s;uppo&s;ition. The only method of unde|ceiving
us, is, to mount up higher; to examine the
narrow extent of &s;cience, when applied to mateiral
cau&s;es; and to convince our&s;elves, that all we know
of them, is, the con&s;tant conjunction and inference
above-mentioned. We may, perhaps, find, that 'tis
with difficulty we are induced to fix &s;uch narrow li|mits
to human under&s;tanding: But we can afterwards
find no difficulty, when we come to apply this doc|trine
to the actions of the will. For as 'tis evident,
that the&s;e have a regular conjunction with motives
and circum&s;tances and characters, and as we always
draw inferences from the one to the other, we
mu&s;t be obliged to acknowlege, in words, that ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
which we have already avowed, in every
deliberation of our lives, and in every &s;tep of our
conduct and behaviour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The prevalence of the doctrine of liberty may be accounted for, from another cau&s;e, viz. a fal&s;e &s;en&s;ation or &s;eeming expe|rience which we have, or may have, of liberty or indifference, in many of our actions. The nece&s;&s;ity of any action, whether of matter or of mind, is not, properly &s;peaking, a quality in the agent, but in any thinking or intelligent being, who may con|&s;ider the action; and it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the determination of his thoughts to infer the exi&s;tence of that action from &s;ome pre|ceding objects; as liberty, when oppo&s;ed to nece&s;&s;ity, is nothing but the want of that determination, and a certain loo&s;ene&s;s or indifference, which we feel, in pa&s;&s;ing, or not pa&s;&s;ing, from the idea of one object to that of any &s;ucceeding one. Now we may ob&s;erve, that, tho' in <HI>reflecting</HI> on human actions we &s;eldom feel &s;uch a loo&s;ene&s;s or indifference, but are commonly able to infer them with con&s;iderable certainty from their motives, and from the di&s;po&s;itions of the agent; yet it frequently happens, that, in <HI>performing</HI> the actions them&s;elves, we are &s;en&s;ible of &s;omething like it: And as all re&s;embling objects are readily taken for each other, this has been employed as a demon&s;trative and even an intuitive proof of human liberty. We feel, that our actions are &s;ubject to our will, on mo&s;t occa&s;ions; and imagine we feel, that the will it&s;elf is &s;ubject to nothing, becau&s;e, when by a denial of it we are provoked to try, we feel that it moves ea&s;ily every way, and produces an image of it&s;elf, (or a <HI>Velleity,</HI> as it is called in the &s;chools) even on that &s;ide, on which it did not &s;ettle. This image, or faint motion, we per&s;uade our&s;elves, could, at that time, have been compleated into the thing it&s;elf; becau&s;e, &s;hould that be denied, we find, upon a &s;econd trial, that, at pre&s;ent, it can. We con&s;ider not, that the fanta&s;tical de&s;ire of &s;hewing liberty, is here the motive of our actions. And it &s;eems certain, that however we may imagine we feel a liberty within our&s;elves, a &s;pectator can commonly infer our actions from our motives and character; and even where he cannot, he concludes in general, that he might, were he perfectly acquainted with every circum|&s;tance of our &s;ituation and temper, and the mo&s;t &s;ecret &s;prings of our complexion and di&s;po&s;ition. Now this is the very e&s;&s;ence of nece&s;&s;ity, according to the foregoing doctrine.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="143">
BUT to proceed in this reconciling project with re|gard
to the que&s;tion of liberty and nece&s;&s;ity; the
<PB N="145" REF="144">
mo&s;t contentious que&s;tion, of metaphy&s;ics, the mo&s;t
contentious &s;cience; it will not require many words to
prove, that all mankind have ever agreed in the doc|trine
of liberty as well as in that of nece&s;&s;ity, and
that the whole di&s;pute, in this re&s;pect al&s;o, has been
hitherto merely verbal. For what is meant by liber|ty,
when applied to voluntary actions? We cannot
&s;urely mean, that actions have &s;o little connexion
with motives, inclinations, and circum&s;tances, that
the one does not follow with a certain degree of uni|formity
from the other, and that the one affords no
inference, from which we can conclude the exi&s;tence
of the other. For the&s;e are plain and acknowleged
matters of fact. By liberty, then, we can only mean
<HI>a power of acting or not acting, according to the deter|minations
of the will;</HI> that is, if we chu&s;e to remain
at re&s;t, we may; if we chu&s;e to move, we al&s;o may.
Now this hypothetical liberty is univer&s;ally allowed to
belong to every body, who is not a pri&s;oner and in
chains. Here then is no &s;ubject of di&s;pute.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="145">
WHATEVER definition we may give of liberty, we
&s;hould be careful to ob&s;erve two requi&s;ite circum|&s;tances;
<HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that it be con&s;i&s;tent with plain matter
of fact; <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that it be con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf. If
we ob&s;erve the&s;e circum&s;tances, and render our defi|nition
intelligible, I am per&s;uaded that all mankind
will be found of one opinion with regard to it.</P>
<P>'TIS univer&s;ally allowed, that nothing exi&s;ts with|out
a cau&s;e of its exi&s;tence, and that chance, when
&s;trictly examined, is a mere negative word, and means
not any real power, which has, any where, a being
in nature. But 'tis pretended that &s;ome cau&s;es are ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
and &s;ome are not nece&s;&s;ary. Here then is
the admirable advantage of definitions. Let any one
<HI>define</HI> a cau&s;e, without comprehending, as a part of
the definition, a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary connexion</HI> with its effect;
and let him &s;hew di&s;tinctly the origin of the idea, ex|pre&s;&s;ed
by the definition; and I &s;hall frankly give up
the whole controver&s;y. But if the foregoing explica|tion
of the matter be received, this mu&s;t be ab&s;olutely
impracticable. Had not objects a regular conjunction
with each other, we &s;hould never have entertained any
notion of cau&s;e and effect; and this regular conjunc|tion
produces that inference of the under&s;tanding,
which is the only connexion, that we can have any
comprehen&s;ion of. Whoever attempts a definition of
cau&s;e, exclu&s;ive of the&s;e circum&s;tances, will be obliged,
either to employ unintelligible terms, or &s;uch as are
<PB N="147" REF="146">
&s;ynonimous to the term, which he endeavours to de|fine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus if a cau&s;e be defined, <HI>that which produces any thing;</HI> 'tis ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that <HI>producing</HI> is &s;ynonimous to <HI>cau&s;ing.</HI> In like manner, if a cau&s;e be defined, <HI>that by which any thing ex|i&s;ts;</HI> this is liable to the &s;ame objection.

And if the definition above-mentioned be ad|mitted;
liberty, when oppo&s;ed to nece&s;&s;ity, not to

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no method of rea&s;oning more common,
and yet none more blameable, than in philo&s;ophical
debates, to endeavour the refutation of any hypothe&s;is,
by a pretext of its dangerous con&s;equences to religion
and morality. When any opinion leads into ab&s;urdi|ties,
'tis certainly fal&s;e; but 'tis not certain that an opi|nion
is fal&s;e, becau&s;e 'tis of dangerous con&s;equence.
Such topics, therefore, ought entirely to be forborne;
as &s;erving nothing to the di&s;covery of truth, but only to
make the per&s;on of an antagoni&s;t odious. This I ob|&s;erve
<PB N="148" REF="147">
in general, without pretending to draw any ad|vantage
from it. I &s;ubmit frankly to an examination
of this kind, and &s;hall venture to affirm, that the
doctrines, both of nece&s;&s;ity and of liberty, as above
explained, are not only con&s;i&s;tent with morality and
religion, but are ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to the &s;upport of
them.</P>
<P>NECESSITY may be defined two ways, conformable
to the two definitions of <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> of which it makes an
e&s;&s;ential part. It con&s;i&s;ts either in the con&s;tant con|junction
of like objects, or in the inference of the
under&s;tanding from one object to another. Now ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
in both the&s;e &s;en&s;es, (which, indeed, are, at
bottom, the &s;ame) has univer&s;ally, tho' tacitly, in
the &s;chools, in the pulpit, and in common life, been
allowed to belong to the will of man; and no man
has ever pretended to deny, that we can draw infe|rences
concerning human actions, and that tho&s;e in|ferences
are founded in the experienced union of like
actions, with like motives, inclinations, and circum|&s;tances.
The only particular, in which any one can
differ, is, that either, perhaps, he will refu&s;e to give
the name of nece&s;&s;ity to this property of human ac|tions:
But as long as the meaning is under&s;tood, I
hope the word can do no harm: Or that he will
maintain it po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover &s;omething farther in
the operations of matter. But this, it mu&s;t be ac|knowleged,
<PB N="149" REF="148">
can be of no con&s;equence to morality or
religion, whatever it may be to natural philo&s;ophy or
metaphy&s;ics. We may here be mi&s;taken in a&s;&s;erting,
that there is no idea of any other nece&s;&s;ity or connexion
in the actions of body: But &s;urely we a&s;cribe nothing
to the actions of the mind, but what every one does,
and mu&s;t readily allow of. We change no circum|&s;tance
in the received orthodox &s;y&s;tem with regard to
the will, but only in that with regard to material ob|jects
and cau&s;es. Nothing therefore can be more
innocent, at lea&s;t, than this doctrine.</P>
<P>ALL laws being founded on rewards and puni&s;h|ments,
'tis &s;uppo&s;ed as a fundamental principle, that
the&s;e motives have a regular and uniform influence on
the mind, and both produce the good and prevent
the evil actions. We may give to this influence, what
name we plea&s;e; but as 'tis u&s;ually conjoined with
the action, it mu&s;t be e&s;teemed a <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> and be looked
upon as an in&s;tance of that nece&s;&s;ity, which we would
here e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>THE only proper object of hatred or vengeance,
is a per&s;on or creature, endowed with thought and
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; and when any criminal or injurious
actions excite that pa&s;&s;ion, 'tis only by their relation
to the per&s;on, or connexion with him. Actions are,
by their very nature, temporary and peri&s;hing; and
where they proceed not from &s;ome <HI>cau&s;e</HI> in the cha|racters
and di&s;po&s;ition of the per&s;on who performed
<PB N="150" REF="149">
them, they can neither redound to his honour, if good,
nor infamy, if evil. The actions them&s;elves may be
blameable; they may be contrary to all the rules of
morality and religion: But the per&s;on is not an&s;wer|able
for them; and as they proceeded from nothing
in him, that is durable and con&s;tant, and leave no|thing
of that nature behind them, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible he
can, upon their account, become the object of puni&s;h|ment
or vengeance. According to the principle,
therefore, which denies nece&s;&s;ity, and con&s;equently
cau&s;es, a man is as pure and untainted, after having
committed the mo&s;t horrid crime, as at the fir&s;t mo|ment
of his birth, nor is his charracter any way con|cerned
in his actions; &s;ince they are not derived from
it, and the wickedne&s;s of the one can never be u&s;ed
as a proof of the depravity of the other.</P>
<P>MEN are not blamed for &s;uch actions, as they per|form
ignorantly and ca&s;ually, whatever may be the
con&s;equences. Why? but becau&s;e the principles of
the&s;e actions are only momentary, and terminate in
them alone. Men are le&s;s blamed for &s;uch actions as
they perform ha&s;tily and unpremeditately, than for
&s;uch as proceed from deliberation. For what rea&s;on?
but becau&s;e a ha&s;ty temper, tho' a con&s;tant cau&s;e or
principle in the mind, operates only by intervals, and
infects not the whole character. Again, repentance
wipes off every crime, if attended with a reformation
of life and manners. How is this to be accounted
<PB N="151" REF="150">
for? but by a&s;&s;erting, that actions render a per&s;on
criminal, merely as they are proofs of criminal prin|ciples
in the mind; and when, by any alteration of
the&s;e principles, they cea&s;e to be ju&s;t proofs, they like|wi&s;e
cea&s;e to be criminal. But except upon the doc|trine
of nece&s;&s;ity, they never were ju&s;t proofs, and
con&s;equently never were criminal.</P>
<P>IT will be equally ea&s;y to prove, and from the &s;ame
arguments, that <HI>liberty,</HI> according to that definition
above mentioned, in which all men agree, is al&s;o e&s;|&s;ential
to morality, and that no human actions, where
it is wanting, are &s;u&s;ceptible of any moral qualities,
or can be the objects either of approbation or di&s;like.
For as actions are objects of our moral &s;entiments, &s;o
far only as they are indications of the internal cha|racter,
pa&s;&s;ions, and affections; 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that
they can give ri&s;e either to prai&s;e or blame, where
they proceed not from the&s;e principles, but are de|rived
altogether from external violence.</P>
<P>I PRETEND not to have obviated or removed all
objections to this theory, with regard to nece&s;&s;ity and
liberty. I can fore&s;ee other objections, derived from
topics, which have not here been treated of. It may
be &s;aid, for in&s;tance, that if voluntary actions be &s;ub|jected
to the &s;ame laws of nece&s;&s;ity with the opera|tions
of matter, there is a continued chain of nece&s;&s;ary
cau&s;es, pre-ordained and pre-determined, reaching
<PB N="152" REF="151">
from the original cau&s;e of all, to every &s;ingle volition
of every human creature. No contingency any where
in the univer&s;e; no indifference; no liberty. While
we act, we are, at the &s;ame time, acted upon. The
ultimate Author of all our volitions is the Creator of
the world, who fir&s;t be&s;towed motion on this immen&s;e
machine, and placed all beings in that particular po|&s;ition,
whence every &s;ub&s;equent event, by an inevi|table
nece&s;&s;ity, mu&s;t re&s;ult. Human actions, there|fore,
either can have no moral turpitude at all, as
proceeding from &s;o good a cau&s;e; or if they have any
turpitude, they mu&s;t involve our Creator in the &s;ame
guilt, while he is acknowleged to be their ultimate
cau&s;e and author. For as a man, who fired a mine,
is an&s;werable for all the con&s;equences, whether the
train he employed be long or &s;hort: &s;o wherever a
continued chain of nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;es are fixed, that Be|ing,
either finite or infinite, who produces the fir&s;t,
is likewi&s;e the author of all the re&s;t, and mu&s;t both
bear the blame and acquire the prai&s;e, which belong
to them. Our cleare&s;t and mo&s;t unalterable ideas of
morality e&s;tabli&s;h this rule, upon unque&s;tionable rea|&s;ons,
when we examine the con&s;equences of any hu|man
action; and the&s;e rea&s;ons mu&s;t &s;till have greater
force, when applied to the volitions and intentions of
a Being, infinitely wi&s;e and powerful. Ignorance or
impotence may be pleaded for &s;o limited a creature as
man; but tho&s;e imperfections have no place in our
Creator. He fore&s;aw, he ordained, he intended all
<PB N="153" REF="152">
tho&s;e actions of men, which we &s;o ra&s;hly pronounce
criminal. And we mu&s;t conclude, therefore, either
that they are not criminal, or that the Deity, not
man, is accountable for them. But as either of the&s;e
po&s;itions is ab&s;urd and impious, it follows, that the
doctrine from which they are deduced, cannot po&s;|&s;ibly
be true, as being liable to all the &s;ame objections.
An ab&s;urd con&s;equence, if nece&s;&s;ary, proves the ori|ginal
doctrine to be ab&s;urd; in the &s;ame manner that
criminal actions render criminal the original cau&s;e, if
the connexion between them be nece&s;&s;ary and ine|vitable.</P>
<P>THIS
objection con&s;i&s;ts of two parts, which we &s;hall
examine &s;eparately; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that if human actions can
be traced up, by a nece&s;&s;ary chain, to the Deity, they
can never be criminal; on account of the infinite per|fection
of that Being, from whom they are derived,
and who can intend nothing but what is altogether
good and laudable. Or <HI>Secondly,</HI> if they be criminal,
we mu&s;t retract the attribute of perfection, which we
a&s;cribe to the Deity, and mu&s;t acknowlege him to be
the ultimate author of guilt and moral trupitude in
all his creatures.</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer to the fir&s;t objection &s;eems obvious and
convincing. There are many philo&s;ophers, who, af|ter
an exact &s;crutiny of all the phaenomena of nature,
conclude, that the WHOLE, con&s;idered as one &s;y&s;tem,
<PB N="154" REF="153">
is, in every period of its exi&s;tence, ordered with per|fect
benevolence; and that the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible hap|pine&s;s
will, in the end, re&s;ult to every created being,
without any mixture of po&s;itive or ab&s;olute ill and
mi&s;ery. Every phy&s;ical ill, &s;ay they, makes an e&s;|&s;ential
part of this benevolent &s;y&s;tem, and could not
po&s;&s;ibly be removed, even by the Deity him&s;elf, con|&s;idered
as a wi&s;e agent, without giving entrance to
greater ill, or excluding greater good, which will re|&s;ult
from it. From this theory, &s;ome philo&s;ophers,
and the antient <HI>Stoics</HI> among the re&s;t, derived a topic
of con&s;olation, under all afflictions, while they taught
their pupils, that tho&s;e ills, under which they laboured,
were, in reality, goods to the univer&s;e; and that to
an enlarged view, which could comprehend the whole
&s;y&s;tem of nature, every event became an object of joy
and exultation. But tho' this topic be &s;pecious and
&s;ublime, it was &s;oon found in practice weak and in|effectual.
You would &s;urely more irritate, than ap|pea&s;e
a man, lying under the racking pains of the
gout, by preaching up to him the rectitude of tho&s;e
general laws, which produced the malignant humours
in his body, and led them, thro' the proper canals,
to the nerves and &s;inews, where they now excite &s;uch
acute torments. The&s;e enlarged views may, for a
moment, plea&s;e the imagination of a &s;peculative man,
who is placed in ea&s;e and &s;ecurity; but neither can
they dwell with con&s;tancy on his mind, even tho' un|di&s;turbed
by the emotions of pain or pa&s;&s;ion; much
<PB N="155" REF="154">
le&s;s can they maintain their ground, when attacked
by &s;uch powerful antagoni&s;ts. The affections take a
narrower and more natural &s;urvey of their objects, and
by an oeconomy, more &s;uitable to the infirmity of hu|man
minds, regard alone the beings around us, and are
actuated by &s;uch events as appear good or ill to the
private &s;y&s;tem. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with <HI>moral</HI> as
with <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> ill. It cannot rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed,
that tho&s;e remote con&s;iderations, which are found of
&s;o little efficacy with regard to one, will have a more
powerful influence with regard to the other. The
mind of man is &s;o formed by nature, that, upon the
appearance of certain characters, di&s;po&s;itions, and
actions, it immediately feels the &s;entiment of appro|bation
or blame; nor are there any emotions more
e&s;&s;ential to its frame and con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE characters, which engage its approbation, are
chiefly &s;uch as contribute to the peace and &s;ecurity of
human &s;ociety; as the characters, which excite blame,
are chiefly &s;uch as tend to public detriment and di&s;|turbance:
Whence we may rea&s;onably pre&s;ume, that
the moral &s;entiments ari&s;e, either mediately or im|mediately,
from a reflection on the&s;e oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts.
What tho' philo&s;ophical meditations e&s;tabli&s;h a diffe|rent
opinion or conjecture; that every thing is right
with regard to the WHOLE, and that the qualities,
which di&s;turb &s;ociety, are, in the main, as beneficial,
and are as &s;uitable to the primary intention of na|ture,
<PB N="156" REF="155">
as tho&s;e which more directly promote its hap|pine&s;s
and welfare? Are &s;uch remote and uncertain
&s;peculations able to counter-balance the &s;entiments,
which ari&s;e from the natural and immediate view of
the objects? A man, who is robbed of a con&s;ide|rable
&s;um; does he find his vexation for the lo&s;s any
way dimini&s;hed by the&s;e &s;ublime reflections? Why
then &s;hould his moral re&s;entment again&s;t the crime be
&s;uppo&s;ed incompatible with them? Or why &s;hould
not the acknowlegement of a real di&s;tinction between
vice and virtue be reconcileable to all &s;peculative
&s;y&s;tems of philo&s;ophy, as well as that of a real di&s;|tinction
between per&s;onal beauty and deformity?
Both the&s;e di&s;tinctions are founded in the natural
&s;entiments of the human mind: And the&s;e &s;entiments
are not to be controled nor altered by any philo&s;o|phical
theory or &s;peculation what&s;oever.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> objection admits not of &s;o ea&s;y and &s;a|tisfactory
an an&s;wer; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to explain di&s;|tinctly,
how the Deity can be the mediate cau&s;e of
all the actions of men, without being the author of
&s;in and moral turpitude. The&s;e are my&s;teries, which
mere natural and una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on is very unfit to
handle; and whatever &s;y&s;tem it embraces, it mu&s;t find
it&s;elf involved in inextricable difficulties, and even
contradictions, at every &s;tep which it takes with re|gard
to &s;uch &s;ubjects. To reconcile the indifference
and contingency of human actions with pre&s;cience;
<PB N="157" REF="156">
or to defend ab&s;olute decrees, and yet free the Deity
from being the author of &s;in, has been found hitherto
to exceed all the &s;kill of philo&s;ophy. Happy, if &s;he
be thence &s;en&s;ible of her temerity, when &s;he pries
into the&s;e &s;ublime my&s;teries; and leaving a &s;cene &s;o
full of ob&s;curities and perplexities, return, with &s;uit|able
mode&s;ty, to her true and proper province, the ex|amination
of common life; where &s;he will find diffi|culties
enow to employ her enquiries, without launch|ing
into &s;o boundle&s;s an ocean of doubt, uncertainty,

<HEAD>SECTION IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the REASON of ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>ALL our rea&s;onings concerning matter of fact
are founded on a &s;pecies of ANALOGY, which
leads us to expect from any cau&s;e the &s;ame events,
which we have ob&s;erved to re&s;ult from &s;imilar cau&s;es.
Where the cau&s;es are entirely &s;imilar, the analogy is
perfect, and the inference, drawn from it, is regarded
as certain and conclu&s;ive: Nor does any man ever
entertain a doubt, where he &s;ees a piece of iron, that
it will have weight and cohe&s;ion of parts; as in all
other in&s;tances, which have ever fallen under his ob|&s;ervation.
But where the objects have not &s;o exact a
&s;imilarity, the analogy is le&s;s perfect, and the infe|rence
is le&s;s conclu&s;ive; tho' &s;till it has &s;ome force,
in proportion to the degrees of &s;imilarity and re&s;em|blance.
The anatomical ob&s;ervations, formed upon
one animal, are by this &s;pecies of rea&s;oning ex|tended
to all animals; and 'tis certain, that when the
circulation of the blood, for in&s;tance, is proved clearly
to have place in one creature, as a frog or fi&s;h, it
<PB N="160" REF="158">
forms a &s;trong pre&s;umption, that the &s;ame principle
has place in all. The&s;e analogical ob&s;ervations may
be carried farther, even to this &s;cience, of which we
are now treating; and any theory, by which we ex|plain
the operations of the under&s;tanding, or the ori|gin
and connexion of the pa&s;&s;ions in man, will acquire
additional authority, if we find, that the &s;ame theory
is requi&s;ite to explain the &s;ame phaenomena in all
other animals. We &s;hall make trial of this, with re|gard
to the hypothe&s;is, by which, in the foregoing
di&s;cour&s;e, we have endeavored to account for all ex|perimental
rea&s;onings; and 'tis hoped, that this new
point of view will &s;erve to confirm all our former ob|&s;ervations.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI>
IT &s;eems evident, that animals, as well as
men, learn many things from experience, and infer,
that the &s;ame events will always follow from the &s;ame
cau&s;es. By this principle, they become acquainted
with the more obvious properties of external objects,
and gradually, from their birth, trea&s;ure up a know|lege
of the nature of fire, water, earth, &s;tones, heights,
dephts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and of the effects, which re&s;ult from their
operation. The ignorance and inexperience of the
young are here plainly di&s;tingui&s;hable from the cun|ning
and &s;agacity of the old, who have learned, by
long ob&s;ervation, to avoid what hurt them, and to
pur&s;ue what gave ea&s;e or plea&s;ure. A hor&s;e, that
has been accu&s;tomed to the field, becomes acquainted
<PB N="161" REF="159">
with the proper height, which he can leap, and will
never attempt what exceeds his force and ability. An
old greyhound will tru&s;t the more fatiguing part of
the chace to the younger, and will place him&s;elf &s;o
as to meet the hare in her doubles; nor are the con|jectures,
which he forms on this occa&s;ion, founded in
any thing but his ob&s;ervation and experience.</P>
<P>THIS is &s;till more evident from the effects of di&s;|cipline
and education on animals, who, by the porper
application of rewards and puni&s;hments, may be taught
any cour&s;e of action, the mo&s;t contrary to their na|tural
in&s;tincts and propen&s;ities. Is it not experience,
which renders a dog apprehen&s;ive of pain, when you
menace him, or lift up the whip to beat him? Is it
not even experience, which makes him an&s;wer to his
name, and infer, from &s;uch an arbitrary &s;ound, that
you mean him rather than any of his fellows, and
intend to call him, when you pronounce it in a cer|tain
manner, and with a certain tone and accent?</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e ca&s;es, we may ob&s;erve, that the animal
infers &s;ome fact beyond what immediately &s;trikes his
&s;en&s;es; and that this inference is altogether founded
on pa&s;t experience, while the creature expects from
the pre&s;ent object the &s;ame events, which it has al|ways
found in its ob&s;ervation to re&s;ult from &s;imilar
objects.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="160">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> 'TIS impo&s;&s;ible, that this inference of the
animal can be founded on any proce&s;s of argument
or rea&s;oning, by which he concludes, that like events
mu&s;t follow like objects, and that the cour&s;e of na|ture
will always be regular in its operations. For if
there be in reality any arguments of this nature, they
&s;urely lie too ab&s;tru&s;e for the ob&s;ervation of &s;uch im|perfect
under&s;tandings; &s;ince it may well employ the
utmo&s;t care and attention of a philo&s;ophic genius to
di&s;cover and ob&s;erve them. Animals, therefore, are not
guided in the&s;e inferences by rea&s;oning: Neither are
children: Neither are the generality of mankind, in
their ordinary actions and conclu&s;ions: Neither are phi|lo&s;ophers
them&s;elves, who, in all the active parts of life,
are, in the main, the &s;ame with the vulgar, and are go|verned
by the &s;ame maxims. Nature mu&s;t have pro|vided
&s;ome other principle, of more ready, and more
general u&s;e and application; nor can an operation of
&s;uch immen&s;e con&s;equence in life, as that of inferring
effects from cau&s;es, be tru&s;ted to the uncertain pro|ce&s;s
of rea&s;oning and argumentation. Were this doubt|ful
with regard to men, it &s;eems to admit of no que&s;|tion
with regard to the brute-creation; and the con|clu&s;ion
being once firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the one, we
have a &s;trong pre&s;umption, from all the rules of ana|logy,
that it ought to be univer&s;ally admitted, with|out
any exception or re&s;erve. 'Tis cu&s;tom alone,
which engages animals, from every object, that &s;trikes
their &s;en&s;es, to infer its u&s;ual attendant, and carries
<PB N="163" REF="161">
their imagination, from the appearance of the one,
to conceive the other, in that &s;trong and lively man|ner,
which we denominate <HI>belief.</HI> No other explica|tion
can be given of this operation, in all the higher,
as well as lower cla&s;&s;es of &s;en&s;itive beings, which
fall under our notice and ob&s;ervation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Since all rea&s;onings concerning facts or cau&s;es is derived merely from cu&s;tom, it may be a&s;ked how it happens, that men &s;o much &s;urpa&s;s animals in rea&s;oning, and one man &s;o much &s;urpa&s;&s;es another? Has not the &s;ame cu&s;tom the &s;ame influence on all?</P>
<P>We &s;hall here endeavour briefly to explain the great difference in human under&s;tandings: After which, the rea&s;on of the diffe|rence between men and animals will ea&s;ily be comprehended.</P>
<P>1. When we have lived any time, and have been accu&s;tomed to the uniformity of nature, we acquire a general habit, by which we always transfer the known to the unknown, and con|ceive the latter to re&s;emble the former. By means of this gene|ral habitual principle, we regard even one experiment as the foun|dation of rea&s;oning, and expect a &s;imilar event with &s;ome degree of certainty, where the experiment has been made accurately, and free from all foreign circum&s;tances. 'Tis therefore con&s;idered as a matter of great importance to ob&s;erve the con&s;equences of things; and as one man may very much &s;urpa&s;s another in at|tention and memory and ob&s;ervation, this will make a very great difference in their rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>2. Where there is a complication of cau&s;es to produce any effect, one mind may be much larger than another, and better able to comprehend the whole &s;y&s;tem of objects, and to infer ju&s;tly their con&s;equences.</P>
<P>3. One man is able to carry on a chain of con&s;equences to a greater length than another.</P>
<P>4. Few men can think long without running into a confu&s;ion of ideas, and mi&s;taking one for another; and there are various degrees of this infirmity.</P>
<P>5. The circum&s;tance, on which the effect depends, is fre|quently involved in other circum&s;tances, which are foreign and extrin&s;ic. The &s;eparation of it often requires great attention, accuracy, and &s;ubtilty.</P>
<P>6. The forming general maxims from particular ob&s;ervation is a very nice operation; and nothing is more u&s;ual, from ha&s;te or a narrowne&s;s of mind, which &s;ees not on all &s;ides, than to com|mit mi&s;takes in this particular.</P>
<P>7. When we rea&s;on from analogies, the man, who has the greater experience or the greater promptitude of &s;ugge&s;ting ana|logies, will be the better rea&s;oner.</P>
<P>8. Bya&s;&s;es from prejudice, education, pa&s;&s;ion, party, &amp;c. hang more upon one mind than another.</P>
<P>9. After we have acquired a confidence in human te&s;timony, books and conver&s;ation enlarge much more the &s;phere of one man's experience and thought than tho&s;e of another.</P>
<P>'Twould be ea&s;y to di&s;cover many other circum&s;tances that make a difference in the under&s;tandings of men.</P></NOTE>.</P>

BUT tho' animals learn many parts of their know|lege
from ob&s;ervation, there are al&s;o many parts of

it, which they derive from the original hand of na|ture,
which much exceed the &s;hare of capacity they

<P>THERE is in Dr. TILLOTSON's writings an
argument again&s;t the <HI>real pre&s;ence,</HI> which is as
conci&s;e, and elegant, and &s;trong as any argument can
po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;ed again&s;t a doctrine, that is &s;o little
worthy of a &s;erious refutation. 'Tis acknowleged on
all hands, &s;ays that learned prelate, that the autho|rity,
either of the &s;cripture or of tradition, is founded
merely in the te&s;timony of the apo&s;tles, who were eye|witne&s;&s;es
to tho&s;e miracles of our Saviour, by which
he proved his divine mi&s;&s;ion. Our evidence, then,
for the truth of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> religion is le&s;s than the
evidence for the truth of our &s;en&s;es; becau&s;e, even
in the fir&s;t authors of our religion, it was no greater;
and 'tis evident it mu&s;t dimini&s;h in pa&s;&s;ing from them
to their di&s;ciples; nor can any one be &s;o certain of
<PB N="168" REF="165">
the truth of their te&s;timony, as of the immediate ob|ject
of his &s;en&s;es. But a weaker evidence can never
de&s;troy a &s;tronger; and therefore, were the doctrine
of the real pre&s;ence ever &s;o clearly revealed in &s;crip|ture,
it were directly contrary to the rules of ju&s;t rea|&s;oning
to give our a&s;&s;ent to it. It contradicts &s;en&s;e,
tho' both the &s;cripture and tradition, on which it is
&s;uppo&s;ed to be built, carry not &s;uch evidence with
them as &s;en&s;e; when they are con&s;idered merely as
external evidences, and are not brought home to every
one's brea&s;t, by the immediate operation of the Holy
Spirit.</P>
<P>NOTHING is &s;o convenient as a deci&s;ive argument
of this kind, which mu&s;t at lea&s;t <HI>&s;ilence</HI> the mo&s;t ar|rogant
bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition, and free us from their
impertinent &s;ollicitations. I flatter my&s;elf, that I have
di&s;covered an argument of a like nature, which, if
ju&s;t, will, with the wi&s;e and learned, be an everla&s;t|ing
check to all kinds of &s;uper&s;titious delu&s;ion, and
con&s;equently, will be u&s;eful as long as the world en|dures.
For &s;o long, I pre&s;ume, will the accounts of
miracles and prodigies be found in all hi&s;tory, &s;acred
and profane.</P>
<P>THO' experience be our only guide in rea&s;oning
concerning matters of fact; it mu&s;t be acknow|leged,
that this guide is not altogether infallible,
but in &s;ome ca&s;es is apt to lead us into errors and
<PB N="169" REF="166">
mi&s;takes. One, who, in our climate, &s;hould expect
better weather in any week of JUNE than in one of
DECEMBER, would rea&s;on ju&s;tly and conformable to
experience; but 'tis certain, that he may happen,
in the event, to find him&s;elf mi&s;taken. However,
we may ob&s;erve, that, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, he would have
no cau&s;e to complain of experience; becau&s;e it com|monly
informs us beforehand of the uncertainty, by
that contrariety of events, which we may learn from
a diligent ob&s;ervation. All effects follow not with
like certainty from their &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;es. Some events
are found, in all countries and all ages, to have been
con&s;tantly conjoined together: Others are found to
have been more variable, and &s;ometimes to di&s;ap|point
our expectations; &s;o that in our rea&s;onings con|cerning
matter of fact, there are all imaginable de|grees
of a&s;&s;urance, from the highe&s;t certainty to the
lowe&s;t &s;pecies of moral evidence.</P>
<P>A WISE man, therefore, proportions his belief to
the evidence. In &s;uch conclu&s;ions as are founded on
an infallible experience, he expects the event with
the la&s;t degree of a&s;&s;urance, and regards his pa&s;t ex|perience
as a full <HI>proof</HI> of the future exi&s;tence of that
event. In other ca&s;es, he proceeds with more cau|tion:
He weighs the oppo&s;ite experiments: He con|&s;iders
which &s;ide is &s;upported by the greate&s;t number
of experiments: To that &s;ide he inclines, with doubt
and he&s;itation; and when at la&s;t he fixes his judgment&punc;
<PB N="170" REF="167">
the evidence exceeds not what we properly call <HI>pro|bability.</HI>
All probability, then, &s;uppo&s;es an oppo&s;i|tion
of experiments and ob&s;ervations; where the one
&s;ide is found to over-balance the other, and to pro|duce
a degree of evidence, proportioned to the &s;u|periority.
An hundred in&s;tances or experiments on
one &s;ide, and fifty on another, afford a very doubtful
expectation of any event; tho' a hundred uniform
experiments, with only one that is contradictory, rea|&s;onably
beget a pretty &s;trong degree of a&s;&s;urance.
In all ca&s;es, we mu&s;t balance the oppo&s;ite experi|ments,
where they are oppo&s;ite, and deduct the
&s;maller number from the greater, in order to know
the exact force of the &s;uperior evidence.</P>
<P>TO apply the&s;e principles to a particular in&s;tance;
we may ob&s;erve, that there is no &s;pecies of rea&s;oning
more common, more u&s;eful, and even nece&s;&s;ary to
human life, than that derived from the te&s;timony of
men, and the reports of eye-witne&s;&s;es and &s;pectators.
This &s;pecies of rea&s;oning, perhaps, one may deny
to be founded on the relation of cau&s;e and effect. I
&s;hall not di&s;pute about a word. It will be &s;ufficient
to ob&s;erve, that our a&s;&s;urance in any argument of
this kind is derived from no other principle than our
ob&s;ervation of the veracity of human te&s;timony, and
of the u&s;ual conformity of facts to the reports of wit|ne&s;&s;es.
It being a general maxim, that no objects
have any di&s;coverable connexion together, and that
<PB N="171" REF="168">
all the inferences, which we can draw from one to
another, are founded merely on our experience of
their con&s;tant and regular conjunction; 'tis evident,
that we ought not to make an exception to this
maxim in favour of human te&s;timony, who&s;e con|nexion
with any events &s;eems, in it&s;elf, as little ne|ce&s;&s;ary
as any other. Were not the memory tena|cious
to a certain degree; had not men commonly an
inclination to truth and a principle of probity; were
they not &s;en&s;ible to &s;hame, when detected in a fal&s;e|hood:
Were not the&s;e, I &s;ay, di&s;covered by <HI>experi|ence</HI>
to be qualities, inherent in human nature, we
&s;hould never repo&s;e the lea&s;t confidence in human
te&s;timony. A man delirious, or noted for fal&s;hood
and villainy, has no manner of authority with us.</P>
<P>AND as the evidence, derived from witne&s;&s;es and
human te&s;timony, is founded on pa&s;t experience,
&s;o it varies with the experience, and is regarded
either as a <HI>proof</HI> or a <HI>probability,</HI> according as the
conjunction between any particular kind of report
and any kind of objects, has been found to be con|&s;tant
or variable. There are a number of circum|&s;tances
to be taken into con&s;ideration in all judg|ments
of this kind; and the ultimate &s;tandard, by
which we determine all di&s;putes, that may ari&s;e con|cerning
them, is always derived from experience and
ob&s;ervation. Where this experience is not entirely
uniform on any &s;ide, 'tis attended with an unavoid|able
contrariety in our judgments, and with the &s;ame
<PB N="172" REF="169">
oppo&s;ition and mutual de&s;truction of arguments as in
every other kind of evidence. We frequently he&s;itate
concerning the reports of others. We balance the
oppo&s;ite circum&s;tances, which cau&s;e any doubt or un|certainty;
and when we di&s;cover a &s;uperiority on any
&s;ide, we incline to it; but &s;till with a diminution of
a&s;&s;urance, in proportion to the forec of its anta|goni&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS
contrariety of evidence, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e,
may be derived from &s;everal different cau&s;es; from
the oppo&s;ition of contrary te&s;timony; from the cha|racter
or number of the witne&s;&s;es; from the manner
of their delivering their te&s;timony; or from the union
of all the&s;e circum&s;tances. We entertain a &s;u&s;picion
concerning any matter of fact, when the witne&s;&s;es
contradict each other; when they are but few, or of
a &s;u&s;picious character; when they have an intere&s;t in
what they affirm; when they deliver their te&s;timony
with doubt and he&s;itation, or on the contrary, with
too violent a&s;&s;everations. There are many other par|ticulars
of the &s;ame kind, which may dimini&s;h or de|&s;troy
the force of any argument, derived from human
te&s;timony.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, for in&s;tance, that the fact, which te&s;|timony
endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h, partakes of the ex|traordinary
and the marvellous; in that ca&s;e, the evi|dence,
re&s;ulting from the te&s;timony, admits a dimi|nution,
<PB N="173" REF="170">
greater or le&s;s, in proportion as the fact is
more or le&s;s unu&s;ual. The rea&s;on, why we place any
credit in witne&s;&s;es and hi&s;torians is not from any <HI>con|nex
on,</HI> which we perceive <HI>&agrave; priori</HI> between te&s;timony
and reality, but becau&s;e we are accu&s;tomed to find a
conformity between them. But when the fact atte&s;ted
is &s;uch a one as has &s;eldom fallen under our ob&s;er|vation,
here is a conte&s;t of two oppo&s;ite experiences;
of which the one de&s;troys the other as far as its force
goes, and the &s;uperior can only operate on the mind
by the force, which remains. The very &s;ame prin|ciple
of experience, which gives us a certain degree
of a&s;&s;urance in the te&s;timony of witne&s;&s;es, gives us
al&s;o, in this ca&s;e, another degree of a&s;&s;urance again&s;t
the fact, which they endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h; from
which contradiction there nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e a counter|poize,
and mutual de&s;truction of belief and autho|rity.</P>

&s;o little analogy to tho&s;e events, of which he had had
con&s;tant and uniform experience. Tho' they were
not contrary to his experience, they were not con|formable
to it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No INDIAN, 'tis evident, could have experience that water did not freeze in cold climates. This is placing nature in a &s;itu|ation quite unknown to him; and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for him to tell <HI>&agrave; priori</HI> what will re&s;ult from it. 'Tis making a new experi|ment, the con&s;equence of which is always uncertain. One may &s;ometimes conjecture from analogy what will follow; but &s;till this is but conjecture. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, that, in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e of freezing, the event follows contrary to the rules of analogy, and is &s;uch as a rational INDIAN would not look for. The operations of cold upon water are not gradual, according to the degrees of cold; but whenever it comes to the freezing point, the water pa&s;&s;es in a moment, from the utmo&s;t liquidity to per|fect hardne&s;s. Such an event, therefore, may be denominated <HI>extraordinary,</HI> and requires a pretty &s;trong te&s;timony, to render it credible to people in a warm climate: But &s;till it is not <HI>mira|calous,</HI> nor contrary to uniform experience of the cour&s;e of na|ture in ca&s;es where all the circum&s;tances are the &s;ame.

<P><PB N="175" REF="172">
BUT in order to increa&s;e the probability again&s;t the
te&s;timony of witne&s;&s;es, let us &s;uppo&s;e that the fact,
which they affirm, in&s;tead of being only marvellous,
is really miraculous; and &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o, that the te&s;ti|mony,

<P>A MIRACLE is a violation of the laws of nature:

the&s;e laws, the proof again&s;t a miracle, from

lead cannot, of it&s;elf, remain &s;u&s;pended in the air;
that fire con&s;umes wood, and is extingui&s;hed by wa|ter;
unle&s;s it be, that the&s;e events are found agree|able
to the laws of nature, and there is required a
violation of the&s;e laws, or in other words, a miracle
to prevent them? Nothing is e&s;teemed a miracle if
it ever happen in the common cour&s;e of nature. 'Tis
no miracle that a man in &s;eeming good health &s;hould
die on a &s;udden; becau&s;e &s;uch a kind of death, tho'
more unu&s;ual than any other, has yet been frequently

ob&s;erved, in any age or country. There mu&s;t, there|fore,
be an uniform experience again&s;t every miracu|lous
event, otherwi&s;e the event would not merit that
appellation. And as an uniform experience amounts
to a proof there is here a direct and full <HI>proof,</HI> from
the nature of the fact, again&s;t the exi&s;tence of any
miracle; nor can &s;uch a proof be de&s;troyed, or the

which is &s;uperior<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sometimes an event may not, <HI>in it&s;elf, &s;eem</HI> to be contrary to the laws of nature, and yet, if it were real, it might, by rea|&s;on of &s;ome circum&s;tances, be denominated a miracle; becau&s;e, in <HI>fact,</HI> it is contrary to the&s;e laws. Thus if a per&s;on, claim|ing a divine authority, &s;hould command a &s;ick per&s;on to be well, a healthful man to fall down dead, the clouds to pour rain, the winds to blow, in &s;hort, &s;hould order many natural events, which immediately follow upon his command; the&s;e might ju&s;tly be e&s;teemed miracles, becau&s;e they are really, in this ca&s;e, con|trary to the laws of nature.

The maxim, by which we commonly conduct our|&s;elves
in our rea&s;onings, is, that the objects, of which
we have no experience, re&s;emble tho&s;e, of which we
have: that what we have &s;ound to be mo&s;t u&s;ual is
always mo&s;t probable; and that where there is an op|po&s;ition
of arguments, we ought to give the prefe|rence
to &s;uch of them as are founded on the greate&s;t
number of pa&s;t ob&s;ervations. But tho' in proceeding
by this rule, we readily reject any fact which is unu|&s;ual
and incredible in an ordinary degree; yet in ad|vancing
farther, the mind ob&s;erves not always the
&s;ame rule; but when any thing is affirmed utterly ab|&s;urd
and miraculous, it rather the more readily admits
&s;uch a fact, upon account of that very circum&s;tance
which ought to de&s;troy all its authority. The pa&s;&s;ion
of <HI>&s;urprize</HI> and <HI>wonder,</HI> ari&s;ing from miracles, being
an agreeable emotion, gives a &s;en&s;ible tendency to|wards
the belief of tho&s;e events from which it is de|rived.
And this goes &s;o far, that even tho&s;e who
cannot enjoy this plea&s;ure immediately, nor can be|lieve
tho&s;e miraculous events, of which they are in|formed,
yet love to partake of the &s;atisfaction at &s;e|cond
hand or by rebound, and place a pride and de|light
in exciting the admiration of others.</P>

the &s;pirit of religion join it&s;elf to the love of wonder,
there is an end of common &s;en&s;e; and human te&s;ti|mony,
in the&s;e circum&s;tances, lo&s;es all preten&s;ions to
authority. A religioni&s;t may be an enthu&s;ia&s;t, and
imagine he &s;ees what has no reality: He may know
his narration to be fal&s;e, and yet per&s;evere in it, with
the be&s;t intentions in the world, for the &s;ake of pro|moting
&s;o holy a cau&s;e: Or even where this delu&s;ion
has no place, vanity, excited by &s;o &s;trong a tempta|tion,
operates on him more powerfully than on the
re&s;t of mankind in any other circum&s;tances; and &s;elf-intere&s;t
with equal force. His auditors may not have,
and commonly have not &s;ufficient judgment to canva&s;s
his evidence: What judgment they have, they re|nounce
by principle, in the&s;e &s;ublime and my&s;terious
&s;ubjects: Or if they were ever &s;o willing to employ
it, pa&s;&s;ion and a heated imagination di&s;turb the regu|larity

impudence: And his impudence over-powers their
credulity.</P>
<P>ELOQUENCE, when in its highe&s;t pitch, leaves
little room for rea&s;on or reflection; but addre&s;&s;ing it|&s;elf
intirely to the fancy or the affections, captivates
the willing hearers, and &s;ubdues their under&s;tanding.
Happily, this pitch it &s;eldom attains. But what a
CICERO or a DEMOSTHENES could &s;carcely operate

over the generality of mankind, and in a higher de|gree,
by touching &s;uch gro&s;s and vulgar pa&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The many in&s;tances of forged miracles, and prophecies, and &s;upernatural events, which, in all ages, have either been detect|ed by contrary evidence, or which detect them&s;elves by their ab|&s;urdity, mark &s;ufficiently the &s;trong propen&s;ity of mankind to the extraordinary and the marvellous, and ought rea&s;onably to beget a &s;u&s;picion again&s;t all relations of this kind. This is our natu|ral way of thinking, even with regard to the mo&s;t common and mo&s;t credible events. For in&s;tance: There is no kind of re|port, which ri&s;es &s;o ea&s;ily, and &s;preads &s;o quickly, e&s;pecially in country places and provincial towns, as tho&s;e concerning mar|riages; in&s;omuch that two young per&s;ons of equal condition never &s;ee each other twice, but the whole neighbourhood imme|diately join them together. The plea&s;ure of telling a piece of news &s;o intere&s;ting, of propagating it, and of being the fir&s;t re|porters of it, &s;preads the intelligence. And this is &s;o well known, that no man of &s;en&s;e gives attention to the&s;e reports, till he finds them confirmed by &s;ome greater evidence. Do not the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, and others &s;till &s;tronger, incline the generality of mankind to the believing and reporting, with the greate&s;t ve|hemence and a&s;&s;urance, all religious miracles?</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIRDLY. It forms a very &s;trong pre&s;umption
again&s;t all &s;upernatural and miraculous relations, that
they are ob&s;erved chiefly to abound among ignorant
and barbarous nations; or if a civilized people has
ever given admi&s;&s;ion to any of them, that people will
be found to have received them from ignorant and
barbarous ance&s;tors, who tran&s;mitted them with that
inviolable &s;anction and authority, which always attend
<PB N="182" REF="179">
received opinions. When we peru&s;e the fir&s;t hi&s;tories
of all nations, we are apt to imagine our&s;elves tran&s;|ported
into &s;ome new world, where the whole frame
of nature is disjointed, and every element performs its
operations in a different manner, from what it does
at pre&s;ent. Battles, revolutions, pe&s;tilences, famines,
and death, are never the effects of tho&s;e natural cau|&s;es,
which we experience. Prodigies, omens, ora|cles,
judgments, quite ob&s;cure the few natural events,
that are intermingled with them. But as the former
grow thinner every page, in proportion as we advance
nearer the enlightened ages of &s;cience and knowlege,
we &s;oon learn, that there is nothing my&s;terious or &s;u|pernatural
in the ca&s;e, but that all proceeds from the
u&s;ual propen&s;ity of mankind towards the marvellous,
and that tho' this inclination may at intervals receive
a check from &s;en&s;e and learning, it can never tho|roughly
be extirpated from human nature.</P>
<P>'<HI>Tis &s;trange,</HI> a judicious reader is apt to &s;ay, upon
the peru&s;al of the&s;e wonderful hi&s;torians, <HI>that &s;uch
prodigious events never happen in our days.</HI> But 'tis no|thing
&s;trange, I hope, that men &s;hould lie in all
ages. You mu&s;t &s;urely have &s;een in&s;tances enow of
that frailty. You have your&s;elf heard many &s;uch
marvellous relations &s;tarted, which being treated with
&s;corn by all the wi&s;e and judicious, have at la&s;t been
abandoned even by the vulgar. Be a&s;&s;ured, that tho&s;e
renowned lies, which have &s;pread and flouri&s;hed to &s;uch

a mon&s;trous height, aro&s;e from like beginnings; but
being &s;own in a more proper &s;oil, &s;hot up at la&s;t into
prodigies almo&s;t equal to tho&s;e which they relate.</P>
<P>'TWAS a wi&s;e policy in that cunning impo&s;tor,
ALEXANDER, who, tho' now forgotten, was once &s;o
famous, to lay the fir&s;t &s;cene of his impo&s;tures in PA|PHLAGONIA,
where, as LUCIAN tells us, the people
were extremely ignorant and &s;tupid, and ready to
&s;wallow even the gro&s;&s;e&s;t delu&s;ion. People at a di&s;|tance,
who are weak enough to think the matter at
all worth inquiry, have no opportunity of receiving
better information. The &s;tories come magnified to
them by a hundred circum&s;tances. Fools are indu&s;|trious
to propagate the delu&s;ion; while the wi&s;e and
learned are contented, in general, to deride its ab|&s;urdity,
without informing them&s;elves of the particu|lar
facts by which it may be di&s;tinctly refuted. And
thus the impo&s;tor above-mentioned was enabled to
proceed, from his ignorant PAPHLAGONIANS, to the
inli&s;ting of votaries, even among the GRECIAN phi|lo&s;ophers,
and men of the mo&s;t eminent rank and
di&s;tinction in ROME: Nay, could engage the atten|tion
of that &s;age emperor MARCUS AURELIUS; &s;o
far as to make him tru&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s of a military ex|pedition
to his delu&s;ive prophecies.</P>
<P>THE advantages are &s;o great of &s;tarting an impo&s;|ture
among an ignorant people, that even tho' the de|lu&s;ion
<PB N="184" REF="181">
&s;hould be too gro&s;s to impo&s;e on the generality
of them <HI>(which, tho' &s;eldom, is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e)</HI> it
has a much better chance of &s;ucceeding in remote
countries, than if the fir&s;t &s;cene had been laid in a
city renowned for arts and knowlege. The mo&s;t ig|norant
and barbarous of the&s;e barbarians carry the re|port
abroad. None of their countrymen have large
enough corre&s;pondence of &s;ufficient credit and autho|rity
to contradict and beat down the delu&s;ion. Mens
inclination to the marvellous has full opportunity to
di&s;play it&s;elf. And thus a &s;tory, which is univer|&s;ally
exploded in the place where it was fir&s;t &s;tarted,
&s;hall pa&s;s for certain at a thou&s;and miles di&s;tance.
But had ALEXANDER fixed his re&s;idence at ATHENS,
the philo&s;ophers of that renowned mart of learning
had immediately &s;pread, thro' the whole ROMAN
empire, their &s;en&s;e of the matter, which, being &s;up|ported
by &s;o great authority, and di&s;played by all the
force of rea&s;on and eloquence, had intirely opened
the eyes of mankind. 'Tis true; LUCIAN pa&s;&s;ing by
chance thro' PAPHLAGONIA had an opportunity of
performing this good office. But, tho' much to be
wi&s;hed, it does not always happen, that every ALE|XANDER
meets with a LUCIAN, ready to expo&s;e and
detect his impo&s;tures<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It may here, perhaps, be objected, that I proceed ra&s;hly, and form my notions of ALEXANDER merely from the account given of him by LUCIAN, a profe&s;&s;ed enemy. It were, indeed, to be wi&s;hed, that &s;ome of the accounts publi&s;hed by his follow|ers and accomplices had remained. The oppo&s;ition and contra&s;t between the character and conduct of the &s;ame man, as drawn by a friend or an enemy, is as &s;trong, even in common life, much more in the&s;e religious matters, as that betwixt any two men in the world, betwixt ALEXANDER and St. PAUL, for in&s;tance. See a letter to GILBERT WEST, E&s;q. on the conver&s;ion and apo&s;tle&s;hip of St. PAUL.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="182">
I MAY add as a <HI>fourth</HI> rea&s;on, which dimini&s;hes
the authority of prodigies, that there is no te&s;timony
for any, even tho&s;e which have not been expre&s;sly de|tected,
that is not oppo&s;ed by an infinite number of
witne&s;&s;es; &s;o that not only the miracle de&s;troys the
credit of the te&s;timony, but even the te&s;timony de|&s;troys
it&s;elf. To make this the better under&s;tood, let
us con&s;ider that, in matters of religion, whatever is
different is contrary, and that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible the reli|gions
of antient ROME, of TURKEY, of SIAM, and
of CHINA &s;hould, all of them, be e&s;tabli&s;hed on any
&s;olid foundation. Every miracle, therefore, pretend|ed
to have been wrought in any of the&s;e religions
(and all of them abound in miracles) as its direct
&s;cope is to e&s;tabli&s;h the particular &s;y&s;tem to which it is
attributed; &s;o has it the &s;ame force, tho' more indi|rectly,
to overthrow every other &s;y&s;tem. In de&s;troy|ing
a rival &s;y&s;tem, it likewi&s;e de&s;troys the credit of
tho&s;e miracles, on which that &s;y&s;tem was e&s;tabli&s;hed;
&s;o that all the prodigies of different religions are to
be regarded as contrary facts, and the evidences of
<PB N="186" REF="183">
the&s;e prodigies, whether weak or &s;trong, as oppo&s;ite
to each other. According to this method of rea&s;on|ing,
when we believe any miracle of MAHOMET or
any of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, we have for our warrant the te&s;|timony
of a few barbarous ARABIANS: And on the
other hand, we are to regard the authority of TITUS
LIVIUS, PLUTARCH, TACITUS, and, in &s;hort, of all
the authors and witne&s;&s;es, GRECIAN, CHINESE, and
ROMAN CATHOLIC, who have related any miracles
in their particular religion; I &s;ay, we are to regard
their te&s;timony in the &s;ame light as if they had men|tioned
that MAHOMETAN miracle, and had in expre&s;s
terms contradicted it, with the &s;ame certainty as they
have for the miracles they relate. This argument
may appear over &s;ubtile and refined; but is not in re|ality
different from the rea&s;oning of a judge, who &s;up|po&s;es,
that the credit of two witne&s;&s;es, maintaining a
crime again&s;t any one, is de&s;troyed by the te&s;timony of
two others, who affirm him to have been two hundred
leagues di&s;tant, at the &s;ame in&s;tant when the crime is
&s;aid to have been committed.</P>
<P>ONE of the be&s;t atte&s;ted miracles in all prophane
hi&s;tory, is that which TACITUS reports of VESPA|SIAN,
who cured a blind man in ALEXANDRIA, by
means of his &s;pittle, and a lame man by the mere
touch of his foot; in obedience to a vi&s;ion of the god
SERAPIS, who had enjoined them to have recour&s;e to
the Emperor, for the&s;e miraculous and extraordinary
<PB N="187" REF="184">
cures. The &s;tory may be &s;een in that fine hi&s;torian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Lib. 5. Cap. 8. SUETONIUS gives the &s;ame ac|count <HI>in vita</HI> VESP.</NOTE>;
where every circum&s;tance &s;eems to add weight to the
te&s;timony, and might be di&s;played at large with all
the force of argument and eloquence, if any one were
now concerned to enforce the evidence of that explo|ded
and idolatrous &s;uper&s;tition. The gravity, &s;olidity,
age, and probity of &s;o great an emperor, who, thro'
the whole cour&s;e of his life, conver&s;ed in a familiar
way with his friends and courtiers, and never affected
tho&s;e extraordinary airs of divinity a&s;&s;umed by ALE|XANDER
and DEMETRIUS. The hi&s;torian, a cotem|porary
writer, noted for candour and veracity, and
withal, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t penetrating genius, per|haps
of all antiquity; and &s;o free from any tendency
to &s;uper&s;tition and credulity, that he even lies under
the contrary imputation, of athei&s;m and prophane|ne&s;s:
The per&s;ons, from who&s;e te&s;timony he related
the miracle, of e&s;tabli&s;hed character for judgment and
veracity, as we may well pre&s;ume; eye-witne&s;&s;es of
the fact, and confirming their verdict, after the FLA|VIAN
family were de&s;poiled of the empire, and could
no longer give any reward, as the price of a lie.
<HI>Utrumque, qui interfuere, nunc quoque memorant, po&s;t|quam
nullum mendacio pretium.</HI> To which if we add
the public nature of the facts, as related, it will ap|pear,
<PB N="188" REF="185">
that no evidence can well be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tronger
for &s;o gro&s;s and &s;o palpable a fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>THERE is al&s;o a very memorable &s;tory related by
Cardinal DE RETZ, and which may well de&s;erve our
con&s;ideration. When that intriguing politician fled
into SPAIN, to avoid the per&s;ecution of his enemies,
he pa&s;&s;ed thro' SARAGOSSA, the capital of ARRA|GON,
where he was &s;hewn, in the cathedral, a man,
who had &s;erved twenty years as a door-keeper, and
was well known to every body in town, that had ever
paid their devotions at that church. He had been
&s;een, for &s;o long a time, wanting a leg; but recover|ed
that limb by the rubbing of holy oil upon the
&s;tump; and the cardinal a&s;&s;ures us that he &s;aw him
with two legs. This miracle was vouched by all the
canons of the church; and the whole company in
town were appealed to for a confirmation of the fact;
whom the cardinal found, by their zealous devotion,
to be thorough believers of the miracle. Here the re|later
was al&s;o cotemporary to the &s;uppo&s;ed prodigy,
of an incredulous and libertine character, as well as of
great genius, the miracle of &s;o <HI>&s;ingular</HI> a nature as
could &s;carce admit of a counterfeit, and the witne&s;&s;es
very numerous, and all of them, in a manner, &s;pecta|tors
of the fact to which they gave their te&s;timony.
And what adds mightily to the force of the evidence,
and may double our &s;urprize on this occa&s;ion, is, that
the cardinal him&s;elf, who relates the &s;tory, &s;eems not
<PB N="189" REF="186">
to give any credit to it, and con&s;equently cannot be
&s;u&s;pected of any concurrence in the holy fraud. He
con&s;idered ju&s;tly, that it was not requi&s;ite, in order to
reject a fact of this nature, to be able accurately to
di&s;prove the te&s;timony, and to trace its fal&s;hood,
thro' all the circum&s;tances of knavery and credulity
which produced it. He knew, that as this was com|monly
altogether impo&s;&s;ible at any &s;mall di&s;tance of
time and place; &s;o was it extremely difficult, even
where one was immediately pre&s;ent, by rea&s;on of the
bigotry, ignorance, cunning and roguery of a great
part of mankind. He therefore concluded, like a
ju&s;t rea&s;oner, that &s;uch an evidence carried fal&s;hood
upon the very face of it, and that a miracle &s;upported
by any human te&s;timony, was more properly a &s;ubject
of deri&s;ion than of argument.</P>
<P>THERE &s;urely never was &s;o great a number of mi|racles
a&s;cribed to one per&s;on, as tho&s;e, which were
lately &s;aid to have been wrought in FRANCE upon the
tomb of Abb&eacute; PARIS, the famous JANSENIST, with
who&s;e &s;anctity the people were &s;o long deluded. The
curing of the &s;ick, giving hearing to the deaf, and
&s;ight to the blind, were every where talked of as the
u&s;ual effects of that holy &s;epulchre. But what is
more extraordinary; many of the miracles were im|mediately
proved, upon the &s;pot, before judges of
unque&s;tioned integrity, atte&s;ted by witne&s;&s;es of credit
and di&s;tinction, in a learned age, and on the mo&s;t
<PB N="190" REF="187">
eminent theatre that is now in the world. Nor is
this all: A relation of them was publi&s;hed and di&s;|per&s;ed
every where; nor were the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> tho' a
learned body, &s;upported by the civil magi&s;trate, and
determined enemies to tho&s;e opinions, in who&s;e fa|vour
the miracles were &s;aid to have been wrought,
ever able di&s;tinctly to refute or detect them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This book was wrote by Mon&s;. de MONTGERON, coun|&s;ellor or judge of the parliament of PARIS, a man of figure and character, who was al&s;o a martyr to the cau&s;e, and is now &s;aid to be &s;omewhere in a dungeon on account of his book.</P>
<P>There is another book in three volumes (called <HI>Recueil des Miracles de l' Abb&eacute;</HI> PARIS) giving an account of many of the&s;e miracles, and accompanied with prefatory di&s;cour&s;es, which are very well wrote. There runs, however, thro' the whole of the&s;e a ridiculous compari&s;on between the miracles of our Saviour and tho&s;e of the Abb&eacute;; wherein 'tis a&s;&s;erted, that the evidence for the latter is equal to that for the former: As if the te&s;timony of men could ever be put in the balance with that of God him|&s;elf, who conducted the pen of the in&s;pired writers. If the&s;e writers, indeed, were to be con&s;idered merely as human te&s;ti|mony, the FRENCH author is very moderate in his compari&s;on; &s;ince he might, with &s;ome appearance of rea&s;on, pretend, that the JANSENIST miracles much &s;urpa&s;s the others in evidence and authority. The following circum&s;tances are drawn from au|thentic papers, in&s;erted in the above-mentioned book.</P>
<P>Many of the miracles of Abb&eacute; PARIS were proved immedi|ately by witne&s;&s;es before the officiality or bi&s;hop's court of PARIS, under the eye of cardinal NOAILLES, who&s;e character for integrity and capacity was never conte&s;ted even by his enemies.</P>
<P>His &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the archbi&s;hopric was an enemy to the JAN|SENISTS, and for that rea&s;on promoted to the &s;ee by the court. Yet 22 rectors or <HI>cures</HI> of PARIS, with infinite earne&s;tne&s;s, pre&s;s him to examine tho&s;e miracles, which they a&s;&s;ert to be known to the whole world, and indi&s;putably certain: But he wi&s;ely forbore.</P>
<P>The MOLINIST party had tried to di&s;credit the&s;e miracles in one in&s;tance, that of Madamoi&s;elle de FRANC. But, be&s;ides that their proceedings were in many re&s;pects the mo&s;t irregular in the world, particularly in citing only a few of the JANSE|NISTS witne&s;&s;es, whom they tampered with: Be&s;ides this, I &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y, they &s;oon found them&s;elves overwhelmed by a cloud of new witne&s;&s;es, one hundred and twenty in number, mo&s;t of them per|&s;ons of credit and &s;ub&s;tance in PARIS, who gave oath for the miracle. This was accompanied with a &s;olemn and earne&s;t ap|peal to the parliament. But the parliament were forbid by au|thority to meddle in the affair. It was at la&s;t ob&s;erved that where men are heated by zeal and enthu&s;ia&s;m, there is no de|gree of human te&s;timony &s;o &s;trong as may not be procured for the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity: And tho&s;e who will be &s;o &s;illy as to examine the affair by that medium, and &s;eek particular flaws in the te&s;ti|mony, are almo&s;t &s;ure to be con&s;ounded. It mu&s;t be a mi&s;erable impo&s;ture, indeed, that does not prevail in that conte&s;t.</P>
<P>All who have been in FRANCE about that time have heard of the great reputation of Mon&s;, HERAUT, the <HI>lieutenant de Police,</HI> who&s;e vigilance, penetration, activity, and exten&s;ive intelligence have been much talked of. This magi&s;trate, who by the nature of his office is almo&s;t ab&s;olute, was inve&s;ted with full powers, on purpo&s;e to &s;uppre&s;s or di&s;credit the&s;e miracles; and he frequently &s;eized immediately, and examined the witne&s;&s;es and &s;ubjects of them: But never could reach any thing &s;atisfactory again&s;t them.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of Madamoi&s;elle THIBAUT he &s;ent the famous De SYLVA to examine her; who&s;e evidence is very curious. The phy&s;ician declares, that it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could have been &s;o ill as was proved by witne&s;&s;es; becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could, in &s;o &s;hort a time, have recovered &s;o perfectly as he found her. He rea&s;oned, like a man of &s;en&s;e, from natural cau&s;es; but the oppo&s;ite party told him, that the whole was a miracle, and that his evidence was the very be&s;t proof of it.</P>
<P>The MOLINISTS were in a &s;ad dilemma. They dur&s;t not a&s;&s;ert the ab&s;olute in&s;ufficiency of human evidence to prove a miracle. They were obliged to &s;ay, that the&s;e miracles were wrought by witchcraft and the devil. But they were told, that this was the re&s;ource of the JEWS of old.</P>
<P>No JANSENIST was ever embarra&s;&s;ed to account for the ce&s;|&s;ation of the miracles, when the church-yard was &s;hut up by the king's edict. It was the touch of the tomb, which opera|ted the&s;e extraordinary effects; and when no one could approach the tomb, no effects could be expected. God, indeed, could have thrown down the walls in a moment; but he is ma&s;ter of his own graces and works, and it belongs not to us to account for them. He did not throw down the walls of every city like tho&s;e of JERICHO, on the &s;ounding of the rams horns, nor break up the pri&s;on of every apo&s;tle, like that of St. PAUL.</P>
<P>No le&s;s a man, than the Duc de CHATILLON, a duke and peer of FRANCE of the highe&s;t rank and family, gives evidence of a miraculous cure, performed upon a &s;ervant of his, who had lived &s;everal years in his hou&s;e with a vi&s;ible and palpable in|firmity.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with ob&s;erving, that no clergy are more cele|brated for &s;trictne&s;s of life and manners than the &s;ecular clergy of FRANCE, particularly the rectors or cur&eacute;s of PARIS, who bear &s;uch te&s;timony to the&s;e impo&s;tures.</P>
<P>The learning, genius, and probity of the gentlemen, and the au&s;terity of the nuns of PORT-ROYAL, have been much cele|brated all over EUROPE. Yet they all give evidence for a mi|racle, wrought on the niece of the famous PASCHAL, who&s;e &s;anctity of life, as well as extraordinary capacity, is well known. The famous RACINE gives an account of this miracle in his famous hi&s;tory of PORT-ROYAL, and fortifies it with all the proofs, which a multitude of nuns, prie&s;ts, phy&s;icians, and men of the world, all of them of undoubted credit, could be&s;tow up|on it. Several men of letters, particularly the bi&s;hop of TOUR|NAY, thought this miracle &s;o certain, as to employ it in the re|futation of athei&s;ts and free-thinkers. The queen-regent of FRANCE, who was extremely prejudiced again&s;t the PORT-ROYAL, &s;ent her own phy&s;ician to examine the miracle, who returned an ab&s;olute convert. In &s;hort, the &s;upernatural cure was &s;o unconte&s;table, that it &s;aved, for a time, that famous mo|na&s;tery from the ruin with which it was threatened by the Je|&s;uits. Had it been a cheat, it had certainly been detected by &s;uch &s;agacious and powerful antagoni&s;ts, and mu&s;t have ha&s;tened the ruin of the contrivers. Our divines, who can build up a formidable ca&s;tle from &s;uch de&s;picable materials; what a prodi|gious fabric could they have reared from the&s;e and many other circum&s;tances, which I have not mentioned! How oft would the great names of PASCHAL, RACINE, ARNAUD, NICOLE, have re&s;ounded in our ears? But if they be wi&s;e, they had better ad|opt the miracle, as being more worth, a thou&s;and times, than all the re&s;t of their collection. Be&s;ides, it may &s;erve very much to their purpo&s;e.

<P>HOW many &s;tories of this nature have, in all ages,
been detected and exploded in their infancy? How
many more have been celebrated for a time, and have
afterwards &s;unk into neglect and oblivion? Where
&s;uch reports, therefore, fly about, the &s;olution of the

<PB N="196" REF="193">
to regular experience and ob&s;ervation, when we
account for it by the known and natural principles of
credulity and delu&s;ion. And &s;hall we, rather than
have a recour&s;e to &s;o natural a &s;olution, allow of a mi|raculous
violation of the mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of
nature?</P>
<P>I NEED not mention the difficulty of detecting a
fal&s;hood in any private or even public hi&s;tory, at the
time and place, where it is &s;aid to happen; much
more where the &s;cene is removed to ever &s;o &s;mall a
di&s;tance. Even a court of judicature, with all the
authority, accuracy, and judgment, which they can
employ, find them&s;elves often at a lo&s;s to di&s;tingui&s;h
between truth and fal&s;hood in the mo&s;t recent actions.
But the matter never comes to any i&s;&s;ue, if tru&s;ted
to the common method of altercation and debate and
flying rumours; e&s;pecially when mens pa&s;&s;ions have
taken party on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>IN the infancy of new religions, the wi&s;e and
learned commonly e&s;teem the matter too incon&s;ider|able
to de&s;erve their attention or regard. And when
afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat, in
order to undeceive the deluded multitude, the &s;ea&s;on
is now gone, and the records and witne&s;&s;es, which
might clear up the matter, have peri&s;hed beyond
recovery.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="194">
NO means of detection remain, but tho&s;e which
mu&s;t be drawn from the very te&s;timony it&s;elf of the
reporters: And the&s;e, tho' always &s;ufficient with the
judicious and knowing, are commonly too fine to
fall under the comprehen&s;ion of the vulgar.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, then, it appears, that no te&s;ti|mony
for any kind of miracle has ever amounted to a
probability, much le&s;s to a proof; and that, even
&s;uppo&s;ing it amounted to a proof, it would be op|po&s;ed
by another proof derived from the very nature
of the fact, which it would endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h.
'Tis experience only, which gives authority to hu|man
te&s;timony; and 'tis the &s;ame experience, which
a&s;&s;ures us of the laws of nature. When, therefore,
the&s;e two kinds of experience are contrary, we have
nothing to do but &s;ub&s;tract the one from the other,
and embrace an opinion, either on one &s;ide or the
other, with that a&s;&s;urance which ari&s;es from the re|mainder.
But according to the principle here ex|plained,
this &s;ub&s;traction, with regard to all popular
religions, amounts to an intire annihilation; and
therefore we may e&s;tabli&s;h it as a maxim, that no
human te&s;timony can have &s;uch force as to prove a
miracle, and make it a ju&s;t foundation for any &s;uch
&s;y&s;tem of religion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I beg the limitations here made may be remarked, when I &s;ay, that a miracle can never be proved, &s;o as to be the founda|tion of a &s;y&s;tem of religion. For I own, that otherwi&s;e, there may po&s;&s;ibly be miracles, or violations of the u&s;ual cour&s;e of nature, of &s;uch a kind as to admit of proof from human te&s;timony; tho', perhaps, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to find any &s;uch in all the records of hi&s;tory. Thus, &s;uppo&s;e, all authors, in all languages, agree, that from the fir&s;t of January, 1600, there was a total darkne&s;s over the whole earth for eight days: Suppo&s;e that the tradition of this extraordinary event is &s;till &s;trong and lively among the People: That all travellers, who return from foreign countries, bring us accounts of the &s;ame tradition, without the lea&s;t varia|tion or contradiction: 'Tis evident, that our pre&s;ent philo&s;o|phers, in&s;tead of doubting of that fact, ought to receive it for certain, and ought to &s;earch for the cau&s;es whence it might be derived. The decay, corruption, and di&s;&s;olution of nature, is an event rendered probable by &s;o many analogies, that any phaeno|menon, which &s;eems to have a tendency towards that cata|&s;trophe, comes within the reach of human te&s;timony, if that te&s;timony be very exten&s;ive, and uniform.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e, that all the hi&s;torians, who treat of ENGLAND, &s;hould agree, that on the fir&s;t of JANUARY, 1600, Queen ELI|ZABETH died; that both before and after her death &s;he was &s;een by her phy&s;icians and the whole court, as is u&s;ual with per|&s;ons of her rank; that her &s;ucce&s;&s;or was acknowleged and pro|claimed by the parliament; and that, after being interred a month, &s;he again appeared, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne, and governed ENGLAND for three years: I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I &s;hould be &s;urprized at the concurrence of &s;o many odd circum&s;tances, but &s;hould not have the lea&s;t inclination to believe &s;o miraculous an event. I &s;hould not doubt of her pretended death, and of tho&s;e other public circum&s;tances that followed it: I &s;hould only a&s;&s;ert it to have been pretended, and that it neither was, nor po&s;&s;ibly could be real. You would in vain object to me the difficulty, and al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ibility of deceiving the world in an affair of &s;uch con|&s;equence; the wi&s;dom and integrity of that renowned queen; with the little or no advantage which &s;he could reap from &s;o poor an artifice: All this might a&s;toni&s;h me; but I would &s;till reply, that the knavery and folly of men are &s;uch common phaeno|mena, that I &s;hould rather believe the mo&s;t extraordinary events to ari&s;e from their concurrence, than admit &s;o &s;ignal a violation of the laws of nature.</P>
<P>But &s;hould this miracle be a&s;cribed to any new &s;y&s;tem of reli|gion; men, in all ages, have been &s;o much impo&s;ed on by ridi|culous &s;tories of that kind, that this very circum&s;tance would be a full proof of a cheat, and &s;ufficient, with all men of &s;en&s;e, not only to make them reject the fact, but even reject it with|out farther examination. Tho' the Being to whom the mi|racle is a&s;cribed, be, in this ca&s;e, Almighty, it does not, upon that account, become a whit more probable; &s;ince 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible for us to know the attributes or actions of &s;uch a being, otherwi&s;e than from the experience which we have of his pro|ductions, in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of nature. This &s;till reduces us to pa&s;t ob&s;ervation, and obliges us to compare the in&s;tances of the violations of truth in the te&s;timony of men with tho&s;e of the violation of the laws of nature by miracles, in order to judge which of them is mo&s;t likely and probable. As the violations of truth are more common in the te&s;timony concerning religious miracles, than in that concerning any other matter of fact; this mu&s;t dimini&s;h very much the authority of the former te&s;ti|mony, and make us form a general re&s;olution, never to lend any attention to it, with whatever &s;pecious pretext it may be co|vered.</P>

principles of the&s;e pretended Chri&s;tians, not as the
word or te&s;timony of God him&s;elf, but as the pro|duction
of a mere human writer and hi&s;torian. Here
then we are fir&s;t to con&s;ider a book, pre&s;ented to us

by a barbarous and ignorant people, wrote in an age
when they were &s;till more barbarous, and in all pro|bability
long after the facts which it relates; corro|borated
by no concurring te&s;timony, and re&s;embling
tho&s;e fabulous accounts, which every nation gives of
its origin. Upon reading this book, we find it full
of prodigies and miracles. It gives an account of a
&s;tate of the world and of human nature intirely dif|ferent
from the pre&s;ent: Of our fall from that &s;tate:
Of the age of man, extended to near a thou&s;and
years: Of the de&s;truction of the world by a deluge:
Of the arbitrary choice of one people, a the favour|ites
of heaven; and that people, the countrymen of
the author: Of their deliverance from bondage by

any one to lay his hand upon his heart, and after &s;e|rious
con&s;ideration declare, whether he thinks, that
the fal&s;hood of &s;uch a book, &s;upported by &s;uch a te&s;|timony,
would be more extraordinary and miraculous
than all the miracles it relates; which is, however,
nece&s;&s;ary to make it be received, according to the

<P>WHAT we have &s;aid of miracles may be applied,
without any variation, to prophecies; and indeed, all

admitted as proofs of any revelation. If it did not

events, it would be ab&s;urd to employ any prophecy

as an argument for a divine mi&s;&s;ion or authority from

that the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion</HI> not only was at fir&s;t attended
with miracles, but even at this day cannot be believed
by any rea&s;onable per&s;on without one. Mere rea&s;on

whoever is moved by <HI>Faith</HI> to a&s;&s;ent to it is con&s;cious

<P>I WAS lately engaged in conver&s;ation with a friend
who loves &s;ceptical paradoxes; where, tho' he ad|vanced
many principles, of which I can by no means
approve, yet as they &s;eem to be curious, and to bear
&s;ome relation to the chain of rea&s;oning carried on
thro' this enquiry, I &s;hall here copy them from my
memory as accurately as I can, in order to &s;ubmit
them to the judgment of the reader.</P>
<P>OUR conver&s;ation began with my admiring the
&s;ingular good fortune of philo&s;ophy, which, as it re|quires
intire liberty, above all other privileges, and
flouri&s;hes chiefly from the free oppo&s;ition of &s;enti|ments
and argumentation, received its fir&s;t birth in an
age and country of freedom and toleration, and was
never cramped, even in its mo&s;t extravagant prin|ciples,
by any creeds, confe&s;&s;ions, or penal &s;tatutes.
For except the bani&s;hment of PROTAGORAS, and the
<PB N="204" REF="201">
death of SOCRATES, which la&s;t event proceeded
partly from other motives, there are &s;carce any in|&s;tances
to be met with, in antient hi&s;tory, of this bi|gotted
jealou&s;y, with which the pre&s;ent age is &s;o much
infe&s;ted. EPICURUS lived at ATHENS to an advan|ced
age, in peace and tranquillity: EPICUREANS
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LUCIANI <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> were even admitted to receive the &s;acerdotal charac|ter,
and to officiate at the altar, in the mo&s;t &s;acred
rites of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion: And the public en|couragement<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> of pen&s;ions and &s;alaries was afforded
equally, by the wi&s;e&s;t of all the ROMAN emperors<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. &amp; Dio.</NOTE>,
to the profe&s;&s;ors of every &s;ect of philo&s;ophy. How re|qui&s;ite
&s;uch kind of treatment was to philo&s;ophy, in
its fir&s;t origin, will ea&s;ily be conceived, if we reflect,
that even at pre&s;ent, when it may be &s;uppo&s;ed more
hardy and robu&s;t, it bears with much difficulty the in|clemency
of the &s;ea&s;ons, and tho&s;e har&s;h winds of ca|lumny
and per&s;ecution, which blow upon it.</P>
<P>YOU admire, &s;ays my friend, as the &s;ingular good
fortune of philo&s;ophy, what &s;eems to re&s;ult from the
natural cour&s;e of things, and to be unavoidable in
every age and nation. This pertinacious bigotry, of
which you complain, as &s;o fatal to philo&s;ophy, is re|ally
her offspring, who, after allying with &s;uper&s;tition,
&s;eparates him&s;elf intirely from the intere&s;t of his pa|rent,
and becomes her mo&s;t inveterate enemy and
<PB N="205" REF="202">
per&s;ecutor. Speculative dogmas of religion, the pre|&s;ent
occa&s;ions of &s;uch furious di&s;pute, could not po&s;|&s;ibly
be conceived or admitted in the early ages of the
world; when mankind, being wholly illiterate,
formed an idea of religion, more &s;uitable to their
weak apprehen&s;ion, and compo&s;ed their &s;acred tenets
chiefly of &s;uch tales as were the objects of traditional
belief, more than of argument or di&s;putation. After the
fir&s;t alarm, therefore, was over, which aro&s;e from
the new paradoxes and principles of the philo&s;ophers;
the&s;e teachers &s;eem ever after, during the ages of an|tiquity,
to have lived in great harmony with the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
&s;uper&s;titions, and to have made a fair partition
of mankind between them; the former claiming all
the learned and the wi&s;e, and the latter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all
the vulgar and illiterate.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems then, &s;ays I, that you leave politics intirely
out of the que&s;tion, and never &s;uppo&s;e, that a wi&s;e
magi&s;trate can ju&s;tly be jealous of certain tenets of
philo&s;ophy, &s;uch as tho&s;e of EPICURUS, which deny|ing
a divine exi&s;tence, and con&s;equently a providence
and a future &s;tate, &s;eem to loo&s;en, in a great mea&s;ure,
the ties of morality, and may be &s;uppo&s;ed, for that
rea&s;on, pernicious to the peace of civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I KNOW, replied he, that in fact the&s;e per&s;ecutions
never, in any age, proceeded from calm rea&s;on, or
any experience of the pernicious con&s;equences of phi|lo&s;ophy;
<PB N="206" REF="203">
but aro&s;e intirely from pa&s;&s;ion and pre|judice.
But what if I &s;hould advance farther, and
a&s;&s;ert, that if EPICURUS had been accu&s;ed before the
people, by any of the <HI>&s;ycophants</HI> or informers of tho&s;e
days, he could ea&s;ily have defended his cau&s;e, and
proved his principles of philo&s;ophy to be as &s;alutary
as tho&s;e of his adver&s;aries, who endeavoured, with
&s;uch zeal, to expo&s;e him to the public hatred and
jealou&s;y?</P>
<P>I WISH, &s;aid I, you would try your eloquence up|on
&s;o extraordinary a topic, and make a &s;peech for
EPICURUS, which might &s;atisfy, not the mob of
ATHENS, if you will allow that antient and polite
city to have contained any mob, but the more philo|&s;ophical
part of his audience, &s;uch as might be &s;up|po&s;ed
capable of comprehending his arguments.</P>
<P>THE matter would not be difficult, upon &s;uch con|ditions,
replied he: And if you plea&s;e, I &s;hall &s;up|po&s;e
my&s;elf EPICURUS for a moment, and make you
&s;tand for the ATHENIAN people, and &s;hall deliver
you &s;uch an harangue as will fill all the urn with white
beans, and leave not a black one to gratify and malice

'Tis &s;ufficient, if I can prove, from this very rea&s;on|ing,
that the que&s;tion is intirely &s;peculative, and that
when, in my philo&s;ophical di&s;qui&s;itions, I deny a pro|vidence
and a future &s;tate, I undermine not the foun|dations
of &s;ociety, but advance principles, which
they them&s;elves, upon their own topics, if they argue
con&s;i&s;tently, mu&s;t allow to be &s;olid and &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>YOU then, who are my accu&s;ers, have acknowleged,
that the chief or &s;ole argument for a divine exi&s;tence
(which I never que&s;tioned) is derived from the order
of nature; where there appear &s;uch marks of intelli|gence
and de&s;ign, that you think it extravagant to a&s;|&s;ign
for its cau&s;e, either chance, or the blind and un|guided
force of matter. You allow, that this is an
argument drawn from effects to cau&s;es. From the
order of the work you infer, that there mu&s;t have
been project and forethought in the workman. If
you cannot make out this point, you allow, that your
conclu&s;ion fails; and you pretend not to e&s;tabli&s;h the
conclu&s;ion in a greater latitude than the phaenomena of
nature will ju&s;tify. The&s;e are your conce&s;&s;ions. I
de&s;ire you to mark the con&s;equences.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="206">
WHEN we infer any particular cau&s;e from an ef|fect,
we mu&s;t proportion the one to the other, and
can never be allowed to a&s;cribe to the cau&s;e any qua|lities,
but what are exactly &s;ufficient to produce the
effect. A body of ten ounces rai&s;ed in any &s;cale may
&s;erve as a proof, that the counterbalancing weight ex|ceeds
ten ounces; but can never afford a rea&s;on that
it exceeds a hundred. If the cau&s;e, a&s;&s;igned for any
effect, be not &s;ufficient to produce it, we mu&s;t either
reject that cau&s;e, or add to it &s;uch qualities as will
give it a ju&s;t proportion to the effect. But if we
a&s;cribe to it farther qualities, or affirm it capable of
producing other effects, we can only indulge the li|cence
of conjecture, and arbitrarily &s;uppo&s;e the exi&s;|tence
of qualities and energies, without rea&s;on or au|thority.</P>
<P>THE
&s;ame rule holds, whether the cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned be
brute uncon&s;cious matter, or a rational intelligent
being. If the cau&s;e be known only by the effect, we
never ought to a&s;&s;ign to it any qualities, beyond what
are preci&s;ely requi&s;ite to produce the effect: Nor can
we, by any rules of ju&s;t rea&s;oning, return back from
the cau&s;e, and infer other effects from it, beyond tho&s;e
by which alone it is known to us. No one, merely
from the &s;ight of one of ZEUXIS's pictures, could
know, that he was al&s;o a &s;tatuary or architect, and
was an arti&s;t no le&s;s &s;kilful in &s;tone and marble than in
colours. The talents and ta&s;te di&s;played in the par|ticular
<PB N="210" REF="207">
work before us; the&s;e we may &s;afely conclude
the workman to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. The cau&s;e mu&s;t be
proportioned to the effect: And if we exactly and
preci&s;ely proportion it, we &s;hall never find in it any
qualities that point farther, or afford an inference con|cerning
any other de&s;ign or performance. Such qua|lities
mu&s;t be &s;omewhat beyond what is merely requi|&s;ite
to produce the effect which we examine.</P>
<P>ALLOWING, therefore, the gods to be the authors of
the exi&s;tence or order of the univer&s;e; it follows, that
they po&s;&s;e&s;s that preci&s;e degree of power, intelligence,
and benevolence, which appears in their workman|&s;hip;
but nothing farther can ever be proved, except
we call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of exaggeration and flattery to
&s;upply the defects of argument and rea&s;oning. So far
as the traces of any attributes, at pre&s;ent, appear, &s;o
far may we conclude the&s;e attributes to exi&s;t. The
&s;uppo&s;ition of farther attributes is mere hypothe&s;is;
much more, the &s;uppo&s;ition, that, in di&s;tant periods of
place and time, there has been, or will be, a more
magnificent di&s;play of the&s;e attributes, and a &s;cheme
of admini&s;tration more &s;uitable to &s;uch imaginary vir|tues.
We can never be allowed to mount up from
the univer&s;e, the effect, to JUPITER, the cau&s;e; and
then de&s;cend downwards, to infer any new effect from
that cau&s;e; as if the pre&s;ent effects alone were not in|tirely
worthy of the glorious attributes which we a&s;|cribe
to that deity. The knowlege of the cau&s;e being
<PB N="211" REF="208">
derived &s;olely from the effect, they mu&s;t be exactly ad|ju&s;ted
to each other, and the one can never refer to
any thing farther, or be the foundation of any new in|ference
and conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>YOU find certain phaenomena in nature. You &s;eek
a cau&s;e or author. You imagine that you have found
him. You afterwards become &s;o enamoured of this
offspring of your brain, that you imagine it impo&s;|&s;ible
but he mu&s;t produce &s;omething greater and more
perfect than the pre&s;ent &s;cene of things, which is &s;o
full of ill and di&s;order. You forget, that this &s;uper|lative
intelligence and benevolence are intirely ima|ginary,
or, at lea&s;t, without any foundation in rea&s;on;
and that you have no ground to a&s;cribe to him any
qualities, but what you &s;ee he has actually exerted
and di&s;played in his productions. Let your gods,
therefore, O philo&s;ophers, be &s;uited to the pre&s;ent
appearances of nature: And pre&s;ume not to alter
the&s;e appearances by arbitrary &s;uppo&s;itions, in order
to &s;uit them to the attributes, which you &s;o fondly
a&s;cribe to your deities.</P>
<P>WHEN prie&s;ts and poets, &s;upported by your autho|rity,
O ATHENIANS, talk of a golden or a &s;ilver age,
which preceded the pre&s;ent &s;cene of vice and mi&s;ery,
I hear them with attention and with reverence. But
when philo&s;ophers, who pretend to neglect authority,
and to cultivate rea&s;on, hold the &s;ame di&s;cour&s;e, I pay
<PB N="212" REF="209">
them not, I own, the &s;ame ob&s;equious &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and
pious deference. I a&s;k; Who carried them into the
cele&s;tial regions, who admitted them into the councils
of the gods, who opened to them the book of fate,
that they thus ra&s;hly affirm that their deities have exe|cuted,
or will execute, any purpo&s;e, beyond what has
actually appeared? If they tell me, that they have
mounted on the &s;teps or by the gradual a&s;cent of rea|&s;on,
and by drawing inferences from effects to cau&s;es,
I &s;till in&s;i&s;t, that they have aided the a&s;cent of rea&s;on
by the wings of imagination; otherwi&s;e they could
not thus change their manner of inference, and argue
from cau&s;es to effect; pre&s;uming, that a more perfect
production than the pre&s;ent world would be more &s;ui|table
to &s;uch perfect beings as the gods, and forget|ting,
that they have no rea&s;on to a&s;cribe to the&s;e cele&s;|tial
beings any perfection or any attribute, but what
can be found in the pre&s;ent world.</P>
<P>HENCE all the fruitle&s;s indu&s;try to account for the
ill appearances of nature, and &s;ave the honour of the
gods; while we mu&s;t acknowlege the reality of that
evil and di&s;order, with which the world &s;o much a|bounds.
The ob&s;tinate and intractable qualities of
matter, we are told, or the ob&s;ervance of general laws;
or &s;ome &s;uch rea&s;on, is the &s;ole cau&s;e, which controlled
the power and benevolence of JUPITER, and obliged
him to create mankind and every &s;en&s;ible creature &s;o
imperfect and &s;o unhappy. The&s;e attributes, then,
<PB N="213" REF="210">
are, it &s;eems, beforehand, taken for granted, in their
greate&s;t latitude. And upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, I own,
that &s;uch conjectures may, perhaps, be admitted as
plau&s;ible &s;olutions of the ill phaenomena&punc; But &s;till I
a&s;k; Why take the&s;e attributes for granted, or why
a&s;cribe to the cau&s;e any qualities but what actually ap|pear
in the effect? Why torture your brain to ju&s;tify
the cour&s;e of nature upon &s;uppo&s;itions, which, for
aught you know, may be intirely imaginary, and of
which there are to be found no traces in the cour&s;e of
nature?</P>
<P>THE religious hypothe&s;is, therefore, mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered
only as a particular method of accounting for
the vi&s;ible phaenomena of the univer&s;e: But no ju&s;t
rea&s;oner will ever pre&s;ume to infer from it any &s;ingle
fact, and alter or add to the phaenomena, in any &s;ingle
particular. If you think, that the appearances of
things prove &s;uch cau&s;es, 'tis allowable for you to draw
an inference concerning the exi&s;tence of the&s;e cau&s;es.
In &s;uch complicated and &s;ublime &s;ubjects, every one
&s;hould be indulged in the liberty of conjecture and ar|gument.
But here you ought to re&s;t. If you come
backward, and arguing from your inferred cau&s;es,
conclude, that any other fact has exi&s;ted, or will exi&s;t,
di&s;play of particular attributes; I mu&s;t admoni&s;h you,
that you have departed from the method of rea&s;on|ing,
attached to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, and mu&s;t certainly
<PB N="214" REF="211">
have added &s;omething to the attributes of the cau&s;e,
beyond what appears in the effect; otherwi&s;e you
could never, with tolerable &s;en&s;e or propriety, add
any thing to the effect, in order to render it more
worthy of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>WHERE, then, is the odiou&s;ne&s;s of that doctrine,
which I teach in my &s;chool, or rather, which I exa|mine
in my gardens? Or what do you find in this
whole que&s;tion, wherein the &s;ecurity of good morals,
or the peace and order of &s;ociety is in the lea&s;t con|cerned?</P>
<P>I
DENY a providence, you &s;ay, and &s;upreme go|vernour
of the world, who guides the cour&s;e of e|vents,
and puni&s;hes the vicious with infamy and di&s;|appointment,
and rewards the virtuous with honour
and &s;ucce&s;s, in all their undertakings. But &s;urely; I
deny not the cour&s;e it&s;elf of events, which lies open
to every one's inquiry and examination. I acknow|lege,
that, in the pre&s;ent order of things, virtue is
attended with more peace of mind than vice; and
meets with a more favourable reception from the
world. I am &s;en&s;ible, that, according to the pa&s;t ex|perience
of mankind, friend&s;hip is the chief joy of
human life, and moderation the only &s;ource of tran|quillity
and happine&s;s. I never balance between the
virtuous and the vicious cour&s;e of life; but am &s;en|&s;ible,
that, to a well di&s;po&s;ed mind, every advantage
<PB N="215" REF="212">
is on the &s;ide of the former. And what can you &s;ay
more, allowing all your &s;uppo&s;itions and rea&s;onings?
You tell me, indeed, that this di&s;po&s;ition of things
proceeds from intelligence and de&s;ign. But whatever
it proceeds from, the di&s;po&s;ition it&s;elf, on which de|pends
our happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, and con&s;equently our
conduct and deportment in life, is &s;till the &s;ame. 'Tis
&s;till open for me, as well as you, to regulate my be|haviour,
by my experience of pa&s;t events. And if
you affirm, that, while a divine providence is allowed,
and a &s;upreme di&s;tributive ju&s;tice in the univer&s;e, I
ought to expect &s;ome more particular reward of the
good, and puni&s;hment of the bad, beyond the ordi|nary
cour&s;e of events; I here find the &s;ame fallacy,
which I have before endeavoured to detect. You per|&s;i&s;t
in imagining, that, if we grant that divine exi&s;|tence,
for which you &s;o earne&s;tly contend, you may
&s;afely infer con&s;equences from it, and add &s;omething
to the experienced order of nature, by arguing from
the attributes which you a&s;cribe to your gods. You
&s;eem not to remember, that all your rea&s;onings on
this &s;ubject can only be drawn from effects to cau&s;es;
and that every argument, deduced from cau&s;es to ef|fects,
mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be a gro&s;s &s;ophi&s;m; &s;ince it is
impo&s;&s;ible for you to know any thing of the cau&s;e, but
what you have, antecedently, not inferred, but di&s;|covered
to the full, in the effect.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="213">
BUT what mu&s;t a philo&s;opher judge of tho&s;e vain
rea&s;oners, who, in&s;tead of regarding the pre&s;ent &s;cene
of things as the &s;ole object of their contemplation, &s;o
far rever&s;e the whole cour&s;e of nature, as to render
this life merely a pa&s;&s;age to &s;omething farther; a
porch, which leads to a greater, and va&s;tly different
building; a prologue, which &s;erves only to introduce
the piece, and give it more grace and propriety?
Whence, do you think, can &s;uch philo&s;ophers derive
their idea of the gods? From their own conceit and
imagination &s;urely. For if they derived it from the
pre&s;ent phaenomena, it would never point to any thing
farther, but mu&s;t be exactly adju&s;ted to them. That
the divinity may <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s attributes, which we
have never &s;een exerted; may be governed by prin|ciples
of action, which we cannot di&s;cover to be &s;a|tisfied:
All this will freely be allowed. But &s;till this
is mere <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> and hypothe&s;is. We never can have
rea&s;on to <HI>infer</HI> any attributes, or any principles of ac|tion
in him, but &s;o far as we know them to have been
exerted and &s;atisfied.</P>
<P><HI>Are there any marks of a di&s;tributive ju&s;tice in the
world?</HI> If you an&s;wer in the affirmative, I conclude,
that, &s;ince ju&s;tice here exerts it&s;elf, it is &s;atisfied. If
you reply in the negative, I conclude, that you have
then no rea&s;on to a&s;cribe ju&s;tice to the gods. If you
hold a medium between affirmation and negation, by
&s;aying, that the ju&s;tice of the gods, at pre&s;ent, exerts
<PB N="217" REF="214">
it&s;elf in part, but not in its full extent; I an&s;wer, that
you have no rea&s;on to give it any particular extent,
but only &s;o far as you &s;ee it, <HI>at pre&s;ent,</HI> exert it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THUS I bring the di&s;pute, O ATHENIANS, to a
&s;hort i&s;&s;ue with my antagoni&s;ts. The cour&s;e of nature
lies open to my contemplation as well as theirs. The
experienced train of events is the great &s;tandard by
which we all regulate our conduct. Nothing el&s;e can
be appealed to in the field, or in the &s;enate. Nothing
el&s;e ought ever to be heard of in the &s;chool, or in the
clo&s;et. In vain would our limited under&s;tandings
break thro' tho&s;e boundaries, which are too narrow
for our fond imaginations. While we argue from the
cour&s;e of nature, and infer a particular intelligent
cau&s;e, which fir&s;t be&s;towed, and &s;till pre&s;erves order in
the univer&s;e, we embrace a principle which is both
uncertain and u&s;ele&s;s. 'Tis uncertain; becau&s;e the
&s;ubject lies intirely beyond the reach of human expe|rience.
'Tis u&s;ele&s;s; becau&s;e our knowlege of this
cau&s;e being derived intirely from the cour&s;e of na|ture,
we can never, according to the rules of ju&s;t rea|&s;oning,
return back from the cau&s;e with any new in|ferences,
or making additions to the common and
experienced cour&s;e of nature, e&s;tabli&s;h any new princi|ples
of conduct and behaviour.</P>
<P>I OBSERVE (&s;ays I, finding he had fini&s;hed his ha|rangue)
that you neglect not the artifice of the dema|gogues
<PB N="218" REF="215">
of old; and as you was plea&s;ed to make me
&s;tand for the people, you in&s;inuate your&s;elf into my
favour, by embracing tho&s;e principles, to which, you
know, I have always expre&s;&s;ed a particular attach|ment.
But allowing you to make experience (as in|deed
I think you ought) the only &s;tandard of our judg|ment
concerning this, and all other que&s;tions of fact;
I doubt not but, from the very &s;ame experience, to
which you appeal, it may be po&s;&s;ible to refute this
rea&s;oning, which you have put into the mouth of
EPICURUS. If you &s;aw, for in&s;tance, a half-fini&s;hed
building &s;urrounded with heaps of brick and &s;tone
and mortar, and all the in&s;truments of ma&s;onry;
could you not <HI>infer</HI> from the effect, that it was a work
of de&s;ign and contrivance? And could you not return
again, from this inferred cau&s;e, to infer new additions
to the effect, and conclude, that the building would
&s;oon be fini&s;hed, and receive all the farther improve|ments,
which art could be&s;tow upon it? If you &s;aw
upon the &s;ea-&s;hore the print of one human foot, you
would conclude, that a man had pa&s;&s;ed that way, and
that he had al&s;o left the traces of the other foot, tho'
effaced by the rolling of the &s;ands or inundation of the
waters. Why then do you refu&s;e to admit the &s;ame
method of rea&s;oning with regard to the order of na|ture?
Con&s;ider the world and the pre&s;ent life only as
an imperfect building, from which you can infer a
&s;uperior intelligence; and arguing from that &s;uperior
intelligence, which can have nothing imperfect; why
<PB N="219" REF="216">
may you not infer a more fini&s;hed &s;cheme or plan,
which will receive its completion in &s;ome di&s;tant pe|riod
of &s;pace or time? Are not the&s;e methods of rea|&s;oning
exactly parallel? And under what pretext can
you embrace the one, while you reject the other?</P>
<P>THE infinite difference of the &s;ubjects, replied he,
is a &s;ufficient foundation for this difference in my con|clu&s;ions.
In works of <HI>human</HI> art and contrivance, 'tis
allowable to advance from the effect to the cau&s;e, and
returning back from the cau&s;e, form new inferences
concerning the effect, and examine the alterations
which it has probably undergone, or may &s;till under|go.
But what is the foundation of this method of
rea&s;oning? Plainly this; that man is a being, whom
we know by experience, who&s;e motives and de&s;igns
we are acquainted with, and who&s;e projects and incli|nations
have a certain connexion and coherence, ac|cording
to the laws which nature has e&s;tabli&s;hed for
the government of &s;uch a creature. When, there|fore,
we find, that any work has proceeded from the
&s;kill and indu&s;try of man; as we are otherwi&s;e ac|quainted
with the nature of the animal, we can draw a
hundred inferences concerning what may be expected
from him; and the&s;e inferences will all be founded on
experience and ob&s;ervation. But did we know man
only from the &s;ingle work or production which we ex|amine,
it were impo&s;&s;ible for us to argue in this man|ner;
becau&s;e our knowlege of all the qualities, which
<PB N="220" REF="217">
we a&s;cribe to him, being in that ca&s;e derived from the
production, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they could point to any
thing farther, or be the foundation of any new infer|ences.
The print of a foot in the &s;and can only
prove, when con&s;idered alone, that there was &s;ome
figure adapted to it, by which it was produced: But
the print of a human foot proves likewi&s;e, from our
other experience, that there was probably another
foot, which al&s;o left its impre&s;&s;ion, tho' effaced by
time or other accide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">s. Here we mount from the ef|fect
to the cau&s;e, and de&s;cending again from the
cau&s;e, infer alterations in the effect; but this is not a
continuation of the &s;ame &s;imple chain of rea&s;oning.
We comprehend in this ca&s;e a hundred other expe|riences
and ob&s;ervations, concerning the <HI>u&s;ual</HI> figure
and members of that &s;pecies of animal, without which
this method of argument mu&s;t be con&s;idered as falla|cious
and &s;ophi&s;tical.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e is not the &s;ame with our rea&s;onings from
the works of nature. The Deity is known to us only
by his productions, and is a &s;ingle being in the uni|ver&s;e,
not comprehended under any &s;pecies or genus,
from who&s;e experienced attributes or qualities, we can,
by analogy, infer any attribute or quality in him. As
the univer&s;e &s;hews wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, we infer
wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. As it &s;hows a particular degree
of the&s;e perfections, we infer a particular degree of
them, preci&s;ely adapted to the effect which we exa|mine.
<PB N="221" REF="218">
But farther attributes or farther degrees of the
&s;ame attributes, we can never be authori&s;ed to infer or
&s;uppo&s;e, by any rules of ju&s;t rea&s;oning. Now without
&s;ome &s;uch licence of &s;uppo&s;ition, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for
us to argue from the cau&s;e, or infer any alteration in
the effect, beyond what has immediately fallen under
our ob&s;ervation. Greater good produced by this Be|ing

of de&s;igns and inclinations; &s;o that when, from
any facts, we have di&s;covered one intention of any man,
it may often be rea&s;onable, from experience, to infer
another, and draw a long chain of conclu&s;ions con|cerning
his pa&s;t or future conduct. But this method
of rea&s;oning never can have place with regard to a
<PB N="223" REF="220">
Being, &s;o remote and incomprehen&s;ible, who bears
much le&s;s analogy to any other being in the univer&s;e
than the &s;un to a waxen taper, and who di&s;covers him|&s;elf
only by &s;ome faint traces or outlines, beyond
which we have no authority to a&s;cribe to him any at|tribute
or perfection. What we imagine to be a &s;u|perior
perfection may really be a defect. Or were it
ever &s;o much a perfection, the a&s;cribing it to the Su|preme
Being, where it appears not to have been real|ly
exerted, to the full, in his works, favours more of
flattery and panegyric, than of ju&s;t rea&s;oning and &s;ound
philo&s;ophy. All the philo&s;ophy, therefore, in the
world, and all the religion, which is nothing but a
&s;pecies of philo&s;ophy, will never be able to carry us
beyond the u&s;ual cour&s;e of experience, or give us mea|&s;ures
of conduct and behaviour different from tho&s;e
which are furni&s;hed by reflections on common life.
No new fact can ever be inferred from the religious
hypothe&s;is; no event fore&s;een or foretold; no reward
or puni&s;hment expected or dreaded, beyond what is
already known by practice and ob&s;ervation. So that
my apology for EPICURUS will &s;till appear &s;olid and
&s;atisfactory; nor have the political intere&s;t of &s;ociety
any connexion with the philo&s;ophical di&s;putes con|cerning
metaphy&s;ics and religion.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;till one circum&s;tance, replied I, which
you &s;eem to have overlooked. I ho' I &s;hould allow
your premi&s;es, I mu&s;t &s;till deny your conclu&s;ion. You
<PB N="224" REF="221">
conclude, that religious doctrines and rea&s;onings <HI>can</HI>
have no influence on life, becau&s;e they <HI>ought</HI> to have
no influence; never con&s;idering, that men rea&s;on not
in the &s;ame manner you do, but draw many con&s;e|quences
from the belief of a divine exi&s;tence, and &s;up|po&s;e
that the Deity will inflict puni&s;hments on vice,
and be&s;tow rewards on virtue, beyond what appear in
the ordinary cour&s;e of nature. Whether this rea&s;on|ing
of their be ju&s;t or not, is no matter. Its influ|ence
on their life and conduct mu&s;t &s;till be the &s;ame.
And tho&s;e, who attempt to di&s;abu&s;e them of &s;uch pre|judices,
may, for aught I know, be good rea&s;oners,
but I cannot allow them to be good citizens and poli|ticians;
&s;ince they free men from one re&s;traint upon
their pa&s;&s;ions, and make the infringement of the laws
of &s;ociety, in one re&s;pect, more ea&s;y and &s;ecure.</P>
<P>AFTER all, I may, perhaps, agree to your general
conclu&s;ion in favour of liberty, tho' upon different pre|mi&s;es
from tho&s;e, on which you endeavour to found it.
I think that the &s;tate ought to tolerate every principle
of philo&s;ophy; nor is there an in&s;tance that any go|vernment
has &s;uffered in its political intere&s;ts by &s;uch
indulgence. There is no enthu&s;ia&s;m among philo|&s;ophers;
their doctrines are not very alluring to the
people; and no re&s;traint can be put upon their rea|&s;onings,
but what mu&s;t be of dangerous con&s;quence
to the &s;ciences, and even to the &s;tate, by paving the
way for per&s;ecution and oppre&s;&s;ion in points where the
<PB N="225" REF="222">
generality of mankind are more deeply intere&s;ted and
concerned.</P>
<P>BUT there occurs to me (continued I) with regard
to your main topic, a difficulty, which I &s;hall ju&s;t pro|po&s;e
to you, without in&s;i&s;ting on it; left it lead into
rea&s;onings of too nice and delicate a nature. In a
word, I much doubt whether it be po&s;&s;ible for a cau&s;e
to be known only by its effect (as you have all along
&s;uppo&s;ed) or to be of &s;o &s;ingular and particular a na|ture
as to have no parallel and no &s;imilarity with any
other cau&s;e or object, that has ever fallen under out
ob&s;ervation. 'Tis only when two <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of objects
are found to be con&s;tantly conjoined, that we can in|fer
the one from the other; and were an effect pre|&s;ented,
which was intirely &s;ingular, and could not be
comprehended under any known <HI>&s;pecies,</HI> I do not &s;ee,
that we could form any conjecture or inference at all
concerning its cau&s;e. If experience and ob&s;ervation
and analogy be, indeed, the only guides which we can
rea&s;onably follow in inferences of this nature; both
the effect and cau&s;e mu&s;t bear a &s;imilarity and re&s;em|blance
to other effects and cau&s;es which we know,
and which we have found, in many in&s;tances, to be
conjoined with each other. I leave it to your own
reflections to pur&s;ue the con&s;equences of this principle.
I &s;hall ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that as the antagoni&s;ts of EPI|CURUS
always &s;uppo&s;e the univer&s;e an effect quite &s;in|gular
and unparalleled; to be the proof of a Deity, a
<PB N="226" REF="223">
cau&s;e no le&s;s &s;ingular and unparalleled; your rea&s;on|ings,
upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;eem, at lea&s;t, to merit
our attention. There is, I own, &s;ome difficulty, how
we can ever return from the cau&s;e to the effect, and
rea&s;oning from our ideas of the former, infer any al|teration
on the latter, or any addition to it.</P>

<P>THERE is not a greater number of philo&s;ophical
rea&s;onings, di&s;played upon any &s;ubject, than
tho&s;e, which prove the exi&s;tence of a Deity, and re|fute
the fallacies of <HI>Athei&s;ts;</HI> and yet the mo&s;t reli|gious
philo&s;ophers &s;till di&s;pute whether any man can
be &s;o blinded as to be a &s;peculative athei&s;t. How
&s;hall we reconcile the&s;e contradictions? The knight|errants,
who wandered about to clear the world of
dragons and giants, never entertained the lea&s;t doubt
with regard to the exi&s;tence of the&s;e mon&s;ters.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sceptic</HI> is another enemy of religion, who na|turally
provokes the indignation of all divines and
graver philo&s;ophers; tho' 'tis certain, that no man
ever met with any &s;uch ab&s;urd creature, or conver&s;ed
with a man, who had no opinion or principle con|cerning
<PB N="228" REF="225">
any &s;ubject, either of action or &s;peculation.
This begets a very natural que&s;tion; What is meant
by a &s;ceptic? And how far it is po&s;&s;ible to pu&s;h the&s;e
philo&s;ophical principles of doubt and uncertainty?</P>
<P>THERE is a &s;pecies of &s;ceptici&s;m, <HI>antecedent</HI> to all
&s;tudy and philo&s;ophy, which is much inculcated by
DES CARTES and others, as a &s;overeign pre&s;erva|tive
again&s;t error and precipitate judgment. It recom|mends
an univer&s;al doubt, not only of all our former
opinions and principles, but al&s;o of our very faculties;
of who&s;e veracity, &s;ay they, we mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves,
by a chain of rea&s;oning, deduced from &s;ome original
principle, which cannot po&s;&s;ibly be fallacious or de|ceitful.
But neither is there any &s;uch original prin|ciple,
which has a prerogative above others, that are
&s;elf-evident and convincing: Or if there were, could
we advance a &s;tep beyond it, but by the u&s;e of the&s;e
very faculties, of which we are &s;uppo&s;ed to be already
diffident. The CARTESIAN doubt, therefore, were
it ever po&s;&s;ible to be attained by any human creature
(as it plainly is not) would be entirely incurable;
and no rea&s;oning could ever bring us to a &s;tate of
a&s;&s;urance and conviction upon any &s;ubject.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t, however, be confe&s;&s;ed, that this &s;pecies of
&s;ceptici&s;m, when more moderate, may be under&s;tood
in a very rea&s;onable &s;en&s;e, and is a nece&s;&s;ary prepara|tive
to the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, by pre&s;erving a pro|per
<PB N="229" REF="226">
impartiality in our judgments, and weaning our
mind from all tho&s;e prejudices, which we may have
imbibed from education or ra&s;h opinion. To begin
with clear and &s;elf-evident principles, to advance by
timorous and &s;ure &s;teps, to review frequently our con|clu&s;ions,
and examine accurately all their con&s;equences;
tho' by this means we &s;hall make both a &s;low and a
&s;hort progre&s;s in our &s;y&s;tems; are the only methods,
by which we can ever hope to reach truth, and attain
a proper &s;tability and certainty in our determina|tions.</P>
<P>THERE
is another &s;pecies of &s;ceptici&s;m, <HI>con&s;equent</HI>
to &s;cience and enquiry, where men are &s;uppo&s;ed to
have di&s;covered, either the ab&s;olute fallaciou&s;ne&s;s of
their mental faculties, or their unfitne&s;s to reach any
fixed determination in all tho&s;e curious &s;ubjects of
&s;peculation, about which they are commonly em|ployed.
Even our very &s;en&s;es are brought into di&s;|pute,
by a certain &s;pecies of philo&s;ophers; and the
maxims of common life are &s;ubjected to the &s;ame
doubt as the mo&s;t profound principles or conclu&s;ions
of metaphy&s;ics and theology. As the&s;e paradoxical
tenets (if they may be called tenets) are to be met
with in &s;ome philo&s;ophers, and the refutation of them
in &s;everal, they naturally excite our curio&s;ity, and
make us enquire into the arguments, on which they
may be founded.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="227">
I NEED not in&s;i&s;t upon the more trite topics, em|ployed
by the &s;ceptics in all ages, again&s;t the evidence
of <HI>&s;en&s;e;</HI> &s;uch as tho&s;e derived from the imperfection
and fallaciou&s;ne&s;s of our organs, on numberle&s;s occa|&s;ions;
the crooked appearance of an oar in water;
the various a&s;pects of objects, according to their dif|ferent
di&s;tances; the double images which ari&s;e from
the pre&s;&s;ing one eye; with many other appearances
of a like nature. The&s;e &s;ceptical topics, indeed, are
only &s;ufficient to prove, that the &s;en&s;es alone are not
implicitely to be depended on; but that we mu&s;t
correct their evidence by rea&s;on, and by con&s;iderations,
derived from the nature of the medium, the di&s;tance
of the object, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the organ, in
order to render them, within their &s;phere, the proper
<HI>criteria</HI> of truth and fal&s;hood. There are other more
profound arguments again&s;t the &s;en&s;es, which admit
not of &s;o ea&s;y a &s;olution.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems evident, that men are carried, by a natu|ral
in&s;tinct or prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to repo&s;e faith in their
&s;en&s;es; and that, without any rea&s;oning, or even al|mo&s;t
before the u&s;e of rea&s;on, we always &s;uppo&s;e an
external univer&s;e, which depends not on our percep|tion,
but would exi&s;t, tho' we and every &s;en&s;ible crea|ture
were ab&s;ent or annihilated. Even the animal
creation are governed by a like opinion, and pre&s;erve
this belief of external objects, in all their thoughts,
de&s;igns, and actions.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="228">
IT &s;eems al&s;o evident, that when men follow this
blind and powerful in&s;tinct of nature, they always
&s;uppo&s;e the very images, pre&s;ented by the &s;en&s;es, to
be the external objects, and never entertain any &s;u&s;|picion,
that the one are nothing but repre&s;entations
of the other. This very table, which we &s;ee white,
and which we feel hard, is believed to exi&s;t, indepen|dent
of our perception, and to be &s;omething external
to our mind, which perceives it. Our pre&s;ence be|&s;tows
not being on it: Our ab&s;ence annihilates it not.
It pre&s;erves its exi&s;tence uniform and entire, indepen|dent
of the &s;ituation of intelligent beings, who per|ceive
or contemplate it.</P>
<P>BUT this univer&s;al and primary opinion of all men
is &s;oon de&s;troyed by the &s;lighte&s;t philo&s;ophy, which
teaches us, that nothing can ever be pre&s;ent to the
mind but an image or perception, and that the &s;en&s;es
are only the inlets, thro' which the&s;e images are re|ceived,
without being ever able to produce any im|mediate
intercour&s;e between the mind and the object.
The table, which we &s;ee, &s;eems to dimini&s;h, as we
remove farther from it: But the real table which ex|i&s;ts
independent of us, &s;uffers no alteration: It was,
therefore, nothing but its image, which was pre&s;ent
to the mind. The&s;e are the obvious dictates of rea|&s;on;
and no man, who reflects, ever doubted, that
the exi&s;tences, which we con&s;ider, when we &s;ay, <HI>this
hou&s;e</HI> and <HI>that tree</HI> are nothing but perceptions in the
<PB N="232" REF="229">
mind, and fleeting copies or repre&s;entations of other
exi&s;tences, which remain uniform and independent.</P>
<P>So far, then, are we nece&s;&s;itated by rea&s;oning to
contradict or depart from the primary in&s;tincts of na|ture,
and to embrace a new &s;y&s;tem with regard to the
evidences of our &s;en&s;es. But here philo&s;ophy finds
it&s;elf extremely embarra&s;&s;ed, when it would ju&s;tify
this new &s;y&s;tem, and obviate the cavils and objections
of the &s;ceptics. It can no longer plead the infallible
and irre&s;i&s;tible in&s;tinct of nature: For that led us to
a quite different &s;y&s;tem, which is acknowledged fal|lible
and even erroneous. And to ju&s;tify this pre|tended
philo&s;ophical &s;y&s;tem, by a chain of clear and
convincing argument, or even any appearance of ar|gument,
exceeds the power of all human capacity.</P>
<P>BY what argument can it be proved, that the per|ceptions
of the mind mu&s;t be cau&s;ed by external ob|jects,
entirely different from them, tho' re&s;embling
them (if that be po&s;&s;ible) and could not ari&s;e either
from the energy of the mind it&s;elf, or from the &s;ug|ge&s;tion
of &s;ome invi&s;ible and unknown &s;pirit, or from
&s;ome other cau&s;e &s;till more unknown to us? 'Tis ac|knowledged,
that, in fact, many of the&s;e perceptions
ari&s;e not from any thing external, as in dreams,
madne&s;s, and other di&s;ea&s;es. And nothing can be
more inexplicable than the manner, in which body
&s;hould &s;o operate upon mind as ever to convey an
<PB N="233" REF="230">
image of it&s;elf to a &s;ub&s;tance &s;uppo&s;ed of &s;o different,
and even contrary a nature.</P>
<P>'TIS a que&s;tion of fact, whether the perceptions
of the &s;en&s;es be produced by external objects, re&s;em|bling
them: How &s;hall this que&s;tion be determined?
By experience &s;urely; as all other que&s;tions of a like
nature. But here experience is, and mu&s;t be entirely
&s;ilent. The mind has never any thing pre&s;ent to it
but the perceptions, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly reach any
experience of their connexion with objects. The &s;up|po&s;ition
of &s;uch a connexion is, therefore, without
any foundation in rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>To have recour&s;e to the veracity of the &s;upreme
Being, in order to prove the veracity of our &s;en&s;es,
is &s;urely making a very unexpected circuit. If his
veracity were at all concerned in this matter, our
&s;en&s;es would be entirely infallible; becau&s;e it is not
po&s;&s;ible that he can ever deceive. Not to mention,
that if the external world be once called in doubt,
we &s;hall be at a lo&s;s to find arguments, by which we
may prove the exi&s;tence of that Being or any of his
attributes.</P>
<P>THIS is a topic, therefore, in which the profounder
and more philo&s;ophical &s;ceptics will always triumph,
when they endeavour to introduce an univer&s;al doubt
into all &s;ubjects of human knowlege and enquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="231">
Do you follow the in&s;tincts and propen&s;ities of nature,
may they &s;ay, in a&s;&s;enting to the veracity of &s;en&s;e?
But the&s;e lead you to believe, that the very perception
or &s;en&s;ible image is the external object. Do you di&s;|claim
this principle, in order to embrace a more ra|tional
opinion, that the perceptions are only repre&s;en|tations
of &s;omething external? You here depart from
your natural propen&s;ities and more obvious &s;entiments;
and yet are not able to &s;atisfy your rea&s;on, which can
never find any convincing argument from experience
to prove, that the perceptions are connected with any
external objects.</P>
<P>THERE is another &s;ceptical topic of a like nature,
derived from the mo&s;t profound philo&s;ophy; which
might merit our attention, were it requi&s;ite to dive &s;o
deep, in order to di&s;cover arguments and rea&s;onings,
which can &s;erve &s;o little any &s;erious purpo&s;e. 'Tis
univer&s;ally allowed by modern enquiers, that all the
&s;en&s;ible qualities of objects, &s;uch as hard, &s;oft, hot,
cold, white, black, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are merely &s;econdary, and
exi&s;t not in the objects them&s;elves, but are perceptions
of the mind, without any external archetype or model,
which they repre&s;ent. If this be allowed, with regard
to &s;econdary qualities, it mu&s;t al&s;o follow with regard to
the &s;uppo&s;ed primary qualities of exten&s;ion and &s;olidity;
nor can the latter be any more entitled to that deno|mination
than the former. The idea of exten&s;ion is
entirely acquired from the &s;en&s;es of &s;ight and feeling;
<PB N="235" REF="232">
and if all the qualities, perceived by the &s;en&s;es, be in
the mind, not in the object, the &s;ame conclu&s;ion
mu&s;t reach the idea of exten&s;ion, which is wholly de|pendent
on the &s;en&s;ible ideas or the ideas of &s;econ|dary
qualities. Nothing can &s;ave us from this con|clu&s;ion,
but the a&s;&s;erting, that the ideas of tho&s;e pri|mary
qualities are attained by <HI>Ab&s;traction;</HI> which, if
we examine accurately, we &s;hall find to be unintel|ligible,
and even ab&s;urd. An exten&s;ion, that is nei|ther
tangible nor vi&s;ible, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be conceived:
And a tangible or vi&s;ible exten&s;ion, which is neither
hard nor &s;oft, black nor white, is equally beyond the
reach of human conception. Let any man try to
conceive a triangle in general, which is neither <HI>I&s;oceles,</HI>
nor <HI>Scalenum,</HI> nor has any particular length nor pro|portion
of &s;ides; and he will &s;oon perceive the ab|&s;urdity
of all the &s;chola&s;tic notions with regard to ab|&s;traction
and general ideas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This argument is drawn from Dr. BERKLEY; and ideed mo&s;t of the writings of that very ingenious author form the be&s;t le&s;&s;ons of &s;ceptici&s;m, which are to be found either among the antient or modern philo&s;ophers, BAYLE not excepted.

which, without the &s;ugge&s;tions of any &s;ceptic, gives
her a diffidence of her&s;elf, and of the ground on

certain places; but that light borders upon

<P>THE ab&s;urdity of the&s;e bold determinations of the
ab&s;tract &s;ciences &s;eems to become, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till
more palpable with regard to time than exten&s;ion.
<PB N="239" REF="236">
An infinite number of real parts of time, pa&s;&s;ing in
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and exhau&s;ted one after another, appears
&s;o evident a contradiction, that no man, one &s;hould
think, who&s;e judgment is not corrupted, in&s;tead of
being improved, by the &s;ciences, would ever be able
to admit of it.</P>
<P>YET &s;till rea&s;on mu&s;t remain re&s;tle&s;s and unquiet,
even with regard to that &s;ceptici&s;m, to which &s;he is
led by the&s;e &s;eeming ab&s;urdities and contradictions.
How any clear, di&s;tinct idea can contain circum&s;tances,
contradictory to it&s;elf, or to any other clear, di&s;tinct
idea, is ab&s;olutely incomprehen&s;ible; and is, perhaps,
as ab&s;urd as any propo&s;ition, which can be formed. So
that nothing can be more &s;ceptical, or more full
of doubt and he&s;itation, than this &s;ceptici&s;m it&s;elf,
which ari&s;es from &s;ome of the paradoxical conclu&s;ions
of geometry or the &s;cience of quantity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;eems to me not impo&s;&s;ible to avoid the&s;e ab&s;urdities and contradictions, if it be admitted, that there is no &s;uch thing as ab&s;tract or general ideas, properly &s;peaking; but that all ge|neral ideas are, in reality, particular ones, attached to a general term, which recalls, upon occa&s;ion, other particular ones, that re&s;emble, in certain circum&s;tances, the idea, pre&s;ent to the mind: Thus when the term Hor&s;e, is pronounced, we immediately figure to our&s;elves the idea of a black or a white animal, of a particular &s;ize or figure: But as that term is al&s;o u&s;ed to be ap|plied to animals of other colours, figures and &s;izes, the&s;e ideas, tho' not actually pre&s;ent to the imagination, are ea&s;ily recalled, and our rea&s;oning and conclu&s;ion proceed in the &s;ame way, as if they were actually pre&s;ent. If this be admitted (as &s;eems rea|&s;onable) it follows that all the ideas of quantity, upon which mathematicians rea&s;on, are nothing but particular, and &s;uch as are &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;en&s;es and imagination, and con&s;equently, cannot be infinitely divi&s;ible. 'Tis &s;ufficient to have dropt this hint at pre&s;ent, without pro&s;ecuting it any farther. It certainly concerns all lovers of &s;cience not to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the ridi|cule and contempt of the ignorant by their conclu&s;ions; and this &s;eems the readie&s;t &s;olution of the&s;e difficulties.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="237">
THE &s;ceptical objections to <HI>moral</HI> evidence, or to
the rea&s;onings concerning matter of fact are either
<HI>popular</HI> or <HI>philo&s;ophical.</HI> The popular objections are
derived from the natural weakne&s;s of human under|&s;tanding;
the contradictory opinions, which have been
entertained in different ages and nations; the variations
of our judgment in &s;ickne&s;s and health, youth and

with many other topics of that kind. 'Tis
needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t farther on this head. The&s;e objec|tions
are but weak. For as, in common life, we rea|&s;on
every moment concerning fact and exi&s;tence, and
cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t, without continually employing
this &s;pecies of argument, any popular objections, de|rived
<PB N="241" REF="238">
from thence, mu&s;t be in&s;ufficient to de&s;troy that
evidence. The great &s;ubverter of <HI>Pyrrhoni&s;m</HI> or the
exce&s;&s;ive principles of &s;ceptici&s;m, is action, and em|ployment,
and the occupations of common life. The&s;e
principles may flouri&s;h and triumph in the &s;chools;
where it is, indeed, difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to re|fute
them. But as &s;oon as they leave the &s;hade, and
by the pre&s;ence of the real objects, which actuate our
pa&s;&s;ions and &s;entiments, are put in oppo&s;ition to the
more powerful principles of our nature, they vani&s;h
like &s;moak, and leave the mo&s;t determined &s;ceptic in
the &s;ame condition as other mortals.</P>
<P>THE &s;ceptic, therefore, had better keep in his pro|per
&s;phere, and di&s;play tho&s;e <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> objections,
which ari&s;e from more profound re&s;earches. Here
he &s;eems to have ample matter of triumph; while
he ju&s;tly in&s;i&s;ts, that all our evidence for any matter
of fact, which lies beyond the te&s;timony of &s;en&s;e or
memory, is derived entirely from the relation of cau&s;e
and effect; that we have no other idea of this relation
than that of two objects, which have been frequently
<HI>cojoined</HI> together; that we have no arguments to
convince us, that object, which have, in our expe|rience,
been frequently conjoined, will likewi&s;e, in
other in&s;tances, be conjoined in the &s;ame manner;
and that nothing leads us to this in&s;erence but cu&s;tom
or a certain in&s;tinct of our nature; which it is indeed
difficult to re&s;i&s;t, but which, like other in&s;tincts, may
be fallacious and deceitful. While the &s;ceptic in&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="242" REF="239">
upon the&s;e topics, he &s;hews his force, or rather, in|deed,
his own and our weakne&s;s; and &s;eems, for the
time at lea&s;t, to de&s;troy all a&s;&s;urance and conviction.
The&s;e arguments might be di&s;played at greater length,
if any durable good or benefit to &s;ociety could ever be
expected to re&s;ult from them.</P>
<P>FOR here is the chief and mo&s;t confounding objec|tion
to <HI>exce&s;&s;ive</HI> &s;ceptici&s;m, that no durable good can
ever re&s;ult from it; while it remains in its full force
and vigour. We need only a&s;k &s;uch a &s;ceptic,
<HI>What his meaning is? And what he propo&s;es by all
the&s;e curious re&s;earches?</HI> He is immediately at a lo&s;s,
and knows not what to an&s;wer. A COPERNICAN or
PTOLEMAIC, who &s;upports each his different &s;y&s;tem
of a&s;tronomy, may hope to produce a conviction,
which will remain, con&s;tant and durable, with his
audience. A STOIC or EPICUREAN di&s;plays prin|ciples,
which may not only be durable, but which
have a mighty effect on conduct and behaviour. But
a PYRRHONIAN cannot propo&s;e that his philo&s;ophy
will have any con&s;tant influence on the mind: Or if
it had, that its influence would be beneficial to &s;oci|ety.
On the contrary, he mu&s;t acknowlege, if he
will acknowlege any thing, that all human life mu&s;t
peri&s;h, were his principles univer&s;ally and &s;teadily to
prevail. All di&s;cour&s;e, all action would immediate|ly
cea&s;e; and men remain in a total lethargy, till
the nece&s;&s;ities of nature, un&s;atisfied, put an end to
<PB N="243" REF="240">
their mi&s;erable exi&s;tence. 'Tis true; &s;o fatal an event
is very little to be dreaded. Nature is always too
&s;trong for principle. And tho' a PYRRHONIAN may
throw him&s;elf or others into a momentary amazement
and confu&s;ion by his profound rea&s;onings; the fir&s;t
and mo&s;t trivial event in life will put to flight all his
doubts and &s;cruples, and leave him the &s;ame, in every
point of action and &s;peculation, with the philo&s;ophers
of every other &s;ect, or with tho&s;e who never con|cerned
them&s;elves in any philo&s;ophical re&s;earches.
When he awakes from his dream, he will be the fir&s;t
to join in the laugh again&s;t him&s;elf, and to confe&s;s,
that all his objections are mere amu&s;ements, and can
have no other tendency than to &s;how the whim&s;ical
condition of mankind, who mu&s;t act and rea&s;on and
believe; tho' they are not able, by their mo&s;t diligent
enquiry, to &s;atisfy them&s;elves concerning the founda|tion
of the&s;e operations, or to remove the objections,
which may be rai&s;ed again&s;t them.</P>

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is, indeed, a more <HI>mitigated</HI> &s;ceptici&s;m or
<HI>academical</HI> philo&s;ophy, which may be both durable
and u&s;eful, and which may, in part, be the re&s;ult of
this PYRRHONISM, or <HI>exce&s;&s;ive</HI> &s;ceptici&s;m, when its
undi&s;tingui&s;hed doubts are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, corrected
by common &s;en&s;e and reflexion. The greate&s;t part of
<PB N="244" REF="241">
mankind are naturally apt to be affirmative and dog|matical
in their opinions; and while they &s;ee objects
only on one &s;ide, and have no idea of any counter|poi&s;ing
arguments, they throw them&s;elves precipi|tately
into the principles, to which they are inclin|ed;
nor have they any indulgence for tho&s;e who en|tertain
oppo&s;ite &s;entiments. To he&s;itate or balance
perplexes their under&s;tandings, checks their pa&s;&s;ion,
and &s;u&s;pends their actions. They are, therefore, im|patient
till they e&s;cape from a &s;tate, which to them is
&s;o unea&s;y; and they think, that they can never re|move
them&s;elves far enough from it, by the violence
of their affirmations and ob&s;tinacy of their belief.
But could &s;uch dogmatical rea&s;oners become &s;en&s;ible
of the &s;trange infirmities of human under&s;tanding,
even in its mo&s;t perfect &s;tate, and when mo&s;t accurate
and cautious in its determinations; &s;uch a reflection
would naturally in&s;pire them with more mode&s;ty and
re&s;erve, and dimini&s;h their fond opinion of them|&s;elves,
and their prejudice again&s;t antagoni&s;ts. The
illiterate may reflect on the di&s;po&s;ition of the learned,
who, amid&s;t all the advantages of &s;tudy and reflec|tion,
are commonly &s;till diffident in their determina|tions:
And if any of the learned are inclined, from
their natural temper, to haughtine&s;s and ob&s;tinacy, a
&s;mall tincture of PYRRHONISM may abate their pride,
by &s;howing them, that the few advantages, which they
may have attained over their fellows, are but incon|&s;iderable,
<PB N="245" REF="242">
if compared with the univer&s;al perplexity
and confu&s;ion, which is inherent in human nature.
In general, there is a degree of doubt, and caution,
and mode&s;ty, which, in all kinds of &s;crutiny and de|ci&s;ion,
ought for ever to accompany a ju&s;t rea&s;oner.</P>
<P>ANOTHER &s;pecies of <HI>mitigated</HI> &s;ceptici&s;m, which
may be of advantage to mankind, and which may be
the natural re&s;ult of the PYRRHONIAN doubts and
&s;cruples, is the limitation of our enquiries to &s;uch
&s;ubjects as are be&s;t adapted to the narrow capacity of
human under&s;tanding. The <HI>imagination</HI> of man is
naturally &s;ublime, delighted with whatever is remote
and extraordinary, and running, without controul,
into the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of &s;pace and time, in or|der
to avoid the objects, which cu&s;tom has rendered
too familiar to it. A correct <HI>judgment</HI> ob&s;erves a con|trary
method; and avoiding all di&s;tant and high en|quiries,
confines it&s;elf to common life, and to &s;uch
&s;ubjects as fall under daily practice and experience;
leaving the more &s;ublime topics to the embelli&s;hment
of poets and orators, or to the arts of prie&s;ts and po|liticians.
To bring us to &s;o &s;alutary a determination,
nothing can be more &s;erviceable, than to be once
thoroughly convinced of the force of the PYRRHONIAN
doubt, and of the impo&s;&s;ibility that any thing but the
&s;trong power of natural in&s;tinct, could free us from
it. Tho&s;e who have a propen&s;ity to philo&s;ophy, will
&s;till continue their re&s;earches; becau&s;e they reflect,
<PB N="246" REF="243">
that be&s;ides the immediate plea&s;ure, attending &s;uch
an occupation, philo&s;ophical deci&s;ions are nothing but
the reflections of common life, methodized and cor|rected.
But they will never be tempted to go be|yond
common life, &s;o long as they con&s;ider the im|perfection
of tho&s;e faculties which they employ, their
narrow reach, and their inaccurate operations. While
we cannot give a &s;atisfactory rea&s;on, why we believe
after a thou&s;and experiments, that a &s;tone will fall, or
fire burn; can we ever &s;atisfy our&s;elves concerning
any determinations which we may form with regard
to the origin of worlds, and the &s;ituation of nature,
from, and to enternity?</P>
<P>THIS narrow limitation, indeed, of our enquiries,
is, in every re&s;pect, &s;o rea&s;onable, that it &s;uffices to
make the &s;lighte&s;t examination into the natural powers
of the human mind, and to compare them to their
objects, in order to recommend it to us. We &s;hall
then find what are the proper &s;ubjects of &s;cience and
enquiry.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems to me, that the only objects of the ab|&s;tract
&s;ciences or of demon&s;tration are quantity and
number, and that all attempts to extend this more
perfect &s;pecies of knowlege beyond the&s;e bounds are
mere &s;ophi&s;try and illu&s;ion. As the component parts
of quantity and number are entirely &s;imilar, their re|lations
become intricate and involved; and nothing
<PB N="247" REF="244">
can be more curious, as well as u&s;eful, than to trace,
by a variety of mediums, their equality or inequality,
thro' their different appearances. But as all other
ideas are clearly di&s;tinct and different from each other,
we can never advance farther, by all our &s;crutiny, than
to ob&s;erve this diver&s;ity, and, by an obvious reflection,
pronounce one thing not to be another. Or if there
be any difficulty in the&s;e deci&s;ions, it proceeds entirely
from the undeterminate meaning of words, which is
corrected by ju&s;ter definitions. That <HI>the &s;quare of the
hypothenu&s;e is equal to the &s;quares of the other two &s;ides,</HI>
cannot be known, let the terms be ever &s;o exactly
defined, without a train of rea&s;oning and enquiry.
But to convince us of this propo&s;ition, <HI>that where there
is no property, there can be no inju&s;tice,</HI> 'tis only nece&s;|&s;ary
to define the terms, and explain inju&s;tice to be a
violation of property. This propo&s;ition is, indeed,
nothing but a more imperfect de&s;inition. 'Tis the
&s;ame ca&s;e with all tho&s;e pretended &s;yllogi&s;tical rea&s;on|ings,
which may be found in every other branch of
learning, except the &s;ciences of quantity and number;
and the&s;e may &s;afely, I think, be pronounced the only
proper objects of knowlege and demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>ALL other enquiries of men regard only matter of
fact and exi&s;tence; and the&s;e are evidently incapable
of demon&s;tration. Whatever <HI>is</HI> may <HI>not be.</HI> No ne|gation
of a fact can involve a contradiction. The
non-exi&s;tence of any being, without exception, is as
<PB N="248" REF="245">
clear and di&s;tinct an idea as its exi&s;tence. The pro|po&s;ition,
which affirms it not to be, however fal&s;e,
is no le&s;s conceivable and intelligible, than that which
affirms it to be. The ca&s;e is different with the &s;ci|ences,
properly &s;o called. Every propo&s;ition, which
is not true, is there confu&s;ed and unintelligible. That
the cube root of 64 is equal to the half of 10, is a
fal&s;e propo&s;ition, and can never be di&s;tinctly conceiv|ed.
But that CAESAR, or the angel GABRIEL, or
any being never exi&s;ted, may be a fal&s;e propo&s;ition,
but &s;till is perfectly conceivable, and implies no con|tradiction.</P>
<P>THE exi&s;tence, therefore, of any being can only
be proved by arguments from its cau&s;e or its effect;
and the&s;e arguments are founded entirely on experi|ence.
If we rea&s;on <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> any thing may appear
able to produce any thing. The falling of a pebble
may, for aught we know, extingui&s;h the &s;un; or the
wi&s;h of a man controul the planets in their orbits.
'Tis only experience, which teaches us the nature and
bounds of cau&s;e and effect, and enables us to in&s;er
the exi&s;tence of one object from that of another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That impious maxim of the antient philo&s;ophy, <HI>Ex nihilo, nihil fit,</HI> by which the creation of matter was excluded, cea&s;es to be a maxim, according to this philo&s;ophy. Not only the will of the &s;upreme Being may create matter; but, for aught we know <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> the will of any other Being might create it, or any other cau&s;e, that the mo&s;t whim&s;ical imagination can a&s;&s;ign.</NOTE>.
<PB N="249" REF="246">
Such is the foundation of moral rea&s;oning, which
forms the greate&s;t part of human knowlege, and is
the &s;ource of all human action and behaviour.</P>
<P>MORAL rea&s;onings are either concerning particular
or general facts. All deliberations in life regard the
former; as al&s;o all di&s;qui&s;itions in hi&s;tory, chronology,
geography, and a&s;tronomy.</P>
<P>THE &s;ciences, which treat of general facts, are po|lities,
natural philo&s;ophy, phy&s;ic, chymi&s;try, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
where the qualities, cau&s;es, and effects of a whole
&s;pecies of objects are enquired into.</P>
<P>DIVINITY or Theology, as it proves the exi&s;tence
of a Deity, and the immortality of &s;ouls, is compo&s;ed
partly of rea&s;onings concerning particular, partly con|cerning
general facts. It has a foundation in <HI>rea|&s;on,</HI>
&s;o far as it is &s;upported by experience. But its
be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olid foundation is <HI>faith</HI> and divine
revelation.</P>
<P>MORALS and critici&s;m are not &s;o properly objects
of the under&s;tanding as of ta&s;te and &s;entiment. Beauty,
whether moral or natural, is felt, more properly than
perceived. Or if we rea&s;on concerning it, and endea|vour
to fix its &s;tandard, we regard a new fact, <HI>viz.</HI>
the general ta&s;te of mankind, or &s;ome &s;uch fact, which
may be the object of rea&s;oning and enquiry.</P>

from their immediate di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, acquire
the appellation of EVIL. Thus moderate warmth is

<P>SOME objects again, by being naturally conform|able

The puni&s;hment of an adver&s;ary, by gratifying re|venge,
is good; the &s;ickne&s;s of a companion, by af|fecting
friend&s;hip, is evil.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="249">
2. ALL good or evil, whence-ever it ari&s;es, pro|duces
various pa&s;&s;ions and affections, according to the
light, in which it is &s;urveyed.</P>
<P>WHEN good is certain or very probable, it pro|duces
JOY: When evil is in the &s;ame &s;ituation, there
ari&s;es GRIEF or SORROW.</P>
<P>WHEN either good or evil is uncertain, it gives ri&s;e
to FEAR or HOPE, according to the degrees of un|certainty
on one &s;ide or the other.</P>
<P>DESIRE ari&s;es from good con&s;idered &s;imply; and
AVERSION, from evil. The WILL exerts it&s;elf, when
either the pre&s;ence of the good or ab&s;ence of the
evil may be attained by any action of the mind or
body.</P>
<P>3. NONE of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions &s;eem to contain any
thing curious or remarkable except <HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI>
which, being derived from the probability of any
good or evil, are mixed pa&s;&s;ions, that merit our
attention.</P>
<P>PROBABILITY ari&s;es from an oppo&s;ition of con|trary
chances or cau&s;es, by which the mind is not
allowed to fix on either &s;ide; but is ince&s;&s;antly to&s;&s;ed
from one to another, and in one moment is deter|mined
to con&s;ider an object as exi&s;tent, and in ano|ther
<PB N="253" REF="250">
moment as the contrary. The imagination or
under&s;tanding, call it which you plea&s;e, fluctuates be|tween
the oppo&s;ite views; and tho' perhaps it may
be oftener turned to one &s;ide than the other, it
is impo&s;&s;ible for it, by rea&s;on of the oppo&s;ition of
cau&s;es or chances, to re&s;t on either. The <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI>
of the que&s;tion alternately prevail; and the mind,
&s;urveying the objects in their oppo&s;ite cau&s;es, finds
&s;uch a contrariety as utterly de&s;troys all certainty or
e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, then, that the object, concerning which
we are doubtful, produces either de&s;ire or aver&s;ion;
it is evident, that, according as the mind turns it&s;elf
to one &s;ide or the other, it mu&s;t feel a momentary im|pre&s;&s;ion
of joy or &s;orrow. An object, who&s;e exi&s;tence
we de&s;ire, gives &s;atisfaction, when we think of tho&s;e
cau&s;es, which produce it; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on,
excites grief or unea&s;ine&s;s from the oppo&s;ite con&s;ide|ration.
So that, as the under&s;tanding, in probable
que&s;tions, is divided between the contrary points of
view, the heart mu&s;t in the &s;ame manner be divided
between oppo&s;ite emotions.</P>
<P>NOW, if we con&s;ider the human mind, we &s;hall
ob&s;erve, that with regard to the pa&s;&s;ions, it is not
like a wind in&s;trument of mu&s;ic, which, in run|ning

agile; but the pa&s;&s;ions, in compari&s;on, are &s;low and
re&s;tive: For which rea&s;on, when any object is pre|&s;ented,
which affords a variety of views to the one
and emotions to the other; tho' the fancy may change
its views with great celerity; each &s;troke will not
produce a clear and di&s;tinct note of pa&s;&s;ion, but the
one pa&s;&s;ion will always be mixed and confounded with
the other. According as the probability inclines to
good or evil, the pa&s;&s;ion of grief or joy predominates
in the compo&s;ition; and the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions being inter|mingled
by means of the contrary views of the ima|gination,
produce by the union the pa&s;&s;ions of hope
or fear.</P>
<P>4. As this theory &s;eems to carry its own evidence
along with it, we &s;hall be more conci&s;e in our proofs.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ions of fear and hope may ari&s;e, when the
chances are equal on both &s;ides, and no &s;uperiority can
be di&s;covered in one above the other. Nay, in this &s;itu|ation
the pa&s;&s;ions are rather the &s;tronge&s;t, as the mind
has then the lea&s;t foundation to re&s;t upon, and is to&s;t
with the greate&s;t uncertainty. Throw in a &s;uperior
degree of probability to the &s;ide of grief, you im|mediately
&s;ee that pa&s;&s;ion diffu&s;e it&s;elf over the com|po&s;ition,
and tincture it into fear. Encrea&s;e the pro|bability,
and by that means the grief; the fear pre|vails
<PB N="255" REF="252">
&s;till more and more, 'till at la&s;t it runs in&s;en&s;ibly,
as the joy continually dimini&s;hes, into pure grief. After
you have brought it to this &s;ituation, dimini&s;h
the grief, by a contrary operation to that, which en|crea&s;ed
it, to wit, by dimini&s;hing the probability on
the melancholy &s;ide; and you will &s;ee the pa&s;&s;ion clear
every moment, 'till it changes in&s;en&s;ibly into hope;
which again runs, by flow degrees, into joy, as you
increa&s;e that part of the compo&s;ition, by the increa&s;e
of the probability. Are not the&s;e as plain proofs,
that the pa&s;&s;ions of fear and hope are mixtures of grief
and joy, as in optics it is a proof, that a coloured ray
of the &s;un, pa&s;&s;ing thro' a pri&s;m, is a compo&s;ition of
two others, when as you dimini&s;h or increa&s;e the
quantity of either, you find it prevail proportionably,
more or le&s;s, in the compo&s;ition?</P>
<P>5.PROBABILITY is of two kinds; either when
the object is it&s;elf uncertain, and to be determined by
chance; or when, tho' the object be already certain,
yet is it uncertain to our judgment, which finds a
number of proofs or pre&s;umptions on each &s;ide of the
que&s;tion. Both the&s;e kinds of probability cau&s;e fear
and hope; which mu&s;t proceed from that property,
in which they agree; to wit, the uncertainty and fluc|tuation
which they be&s;tow on the pa&s;&s;ion, by that con|trariety
of views, which is common to both.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="253">
6. IT is a probable good or evil, which commonly
cau&s;es hope or fear; becau&s;e probability, producing
an incon&s;tant and wavering &s;urvey of an object, oc|ca&s;ions
naturally a like mixture and uncertainty of
pa&s;&s;ion. But we may ob&s;erve, that, wherever, from
other cau&s;es, this mixture can be produced, the pa&s;|&s;ions
of fear and hope will ari&s;e, even tho' there be
no probability.</P>
<P>AN evil, conceived as barely <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> &s;ometimes
produces fear; e&s;pecially if the evil be very great.
A man cannot think of exce&s;&s;ive pain and torture
without trembling, if he runs the lea&s;t ri&s;que of &s;uf|fering
them. The &s;mallne&s;s of the probability is
compen&s;ated by the greatne&s;s of the evil.</P>
<P>BUT even <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> evils cau&s;e fear; as when we
tremble on the brink of a precipice, tho' we know
our&s;elves to be in perfect &s;ecurity, and have it in our
choice, whether we will advance a &s;tep farther. The
immediate pre&s;ence of the evil influences the imagi|nation
and produces a &s;pecies of belief; but being
oppo&s;ed by the reflection on our &s;ecurity, that belief
is immediately retracted, and cau&s;es the &s;ame kind of
pa&s;&s;ion, as when, from a contrariety of chances, con|trary
pa&s;&s;ions are produced.</P>
<P>EVILS, which are <HI>certain,</HI> have &s;ometimes the &s;ame
effect as the po&s;&s;ible or impo&s;&s;ible. A man, in a &s;trong
<PB N="257" REF="254">
pri&s;on, without the lea&s;t means of e&s;cape, trembles at
the thoughts of the rack, to which he is &s;entenced.
The evil is here fixed in it&s;elf; but the mind has not
courage to fix upon it; and this fluctuation gives ri&s;e
to a pa&s;&s;ion of a &s;imilar appearance with fear.</P>
<P>7. BUT it is not only where good or evil is uncer|tain
as to its <HI>exi&s;tence,</HI> but al&s;o as to its <HI>kind,</HI> that fear
or hope ari&s;es. If any one were told that one of his
&s;ons is &s;uddenly killed; the pa&s;&s;ion, occa&s;ioned by
this event, would not &s;ettle into grief, 'till he got cer|tain
information which of his &s;ons he had lo&s;t. Tho'
each &s;ide of the que&s;tion produces here the &s;ame
pa&s;&s;ion; that pa&s;&s;ion cannot &s;ettle, but receives from
the imagination, which is unfixed, a tremulous un|&s;teady
motion, re&s;embling the mixture and contention
of grief and joy.</P>
<P>8. THUS all kinds of uncertainty have a &s;trong
connexion with fear, even tho' they do not cau&s;e any
oppo&s;ition of pa&s;&s;ions, by the oppo&s;ite views, which
they pre&s;ent to us. Should I leave a friend in any
malady, I &s;hould feel more anxiety upon his account,
than if he were pre&s;ent; tho' perhaps I am not only
incapable of giving him a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but likewi&s;e of
judging concerning the event of his &s;ickne&s;s. There
are a thou&s;and little circum&s;tances of his &s;ituation and
condition, which I de&s;ire to know; and the know|lege
of them would prevent that fluctuation and un|certainty,
<PB N="258" REF="255">
&s;o nearly allied to fear. HORACE has re|marked
this phaenomenon.</P>

<P>A VIRGIN on her bridal-night goes to bed full of
fears and apprehen&s;ions, tho' &s;he expects nothing but
plea&s;ure. The confu&s;ion of wi&s;hes and joys, the new|ne&s;s
and greatne&s;s of the unknown event, &s;o embar|ra&s;s
the mind, that it knows not in what image or
pa&s;&s;ion to fix it&s;elf.</P>
<P>9. CONCERNING the mixture of affections, we
may remark, in general, that when contrary pa&s;&s;ions
ari&s;e from objects no way connected together, they
take place alternately. Thus when a man is afflicted
for the lo&s;s of a law-fuit, and joyful for the birth of
a &s;on, the mind, running from the agreeable to the
calamitous object; with whatever celerity it may per|form
this motion, can &s;carcely temper the one affec|tion
with the other, and remain between them in a
&s;tate of indifference.</P>
<P>IT more ea&s;ily attains that calm &s;ituation, when the
<HI>&s;ame</HI> event is of a mixed nature, and contains &s;ome|thing
adver&s;e and &s;omething pro&s;perous in its different
circum&s;tance. For in that ca&s;e, both the pa&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="259" REF="256">
mingling with each other by means of the relation,
often become mutually de&s;tructive, and leave the mind
in perfect tranquillity.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e, that the object is not a compound of
good and evil, but is con&s;idered as probable or im|probable
in any degree; in that ca&s;e the contrary pa&s;|&s;ions
will both of them be pre&s;ent at once in the
&s;oul, and in&s;tead of ballancing and tempering each
other, will &s;ub&s;i&s;t together, and by their union, pro|duce
a third impre&s;&s;ion or affection, &s;uch as hope or
fear.</P>
<P>THE influence of the relations of ideas (which we
&s;hall afterwards explain more fully) is plainly &s;een in
this affair. In contrary pa&s;&s;ions, if the objects be
<HI>totally different,</HI> the pa&s;&s;ions are like two oppo&s;ite li|quors
in different bottles, which have no influence on
each other. If the objects be intimately <HI>connected,</HI> the
pa&s;&s;ions are like an <HI>alcali</HI> and an <HI>acid,</HI> which, being
mingled, de&s;troy each other. If the relation be more
imperfect, and con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>contradictory</HI> views of
the <HI>&s;ame</HI> object, the pa&s;&s;ions are like oil and vinegar,
which, however mingled, never perfectly unite and
incorporate.</P>
<P>THE effect of a mixture of pa&s;&s;ions, when one of
them is predominant and &s;wallows up the other, &s;hall
be explained afterwards.</P>

<P>1. BESIDES tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions above-mentioned,
which ari&s;e from a direct pur&s;uit of good and aver&s;ion
to evil, there are others which are of a more com|plicated
nature, and imply more than one view or
con&s;ideration. Thus <HI>Pride</HI> is a certain &s;atisfaction in
our&s;elves, on account of &s;ome accompli&s;hment or po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion,
which we enjoy: <HI>Humility,</HI> on the other hand,
is a di&s;&s;atisfaction with our&s;elves, on account of &s;ome
defect or infirmity.</P>
<P>LOVE or <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> is a complacency in another,
on account of his accompli&s;hments or &s;ervices: <HI>Ha|tred,</HI>
the contrary.</P>
<P>2. IN the&s;e two &s;ets of pa&s;&s;ions, there is an obvi|ous
di&s;tinction to be made between the <HI>object</HI> of the
pa&s;&s;ion and its <HI>cau&s;e.</HI> The object of pride and hu|mility
is &s;elf: The cau&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ion is &s;ome ex|cellence
in the former ca&s;e; &s;ome fault, in the latter.
The object of love and hatred is &s;ome other per&s;on:
The cau&s;es, in like manner, are either excellencies
or faults.</P>
<P>WITH regard to all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, the cau&s;es are
what excite the emotion; the object is what the mind
directs its view to when the emotion is excited. Our
<PB N="261" REF="258">
merit, for in&s;tance, rai&s;es pride; and it is e&s;&s;ential
to pride to turn our view on our&s;elf with complacency
and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>NOW as the cau&s;es of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are very nu|merous
and various, tho' their object be uniform and
&s;imple; it may be a &s;ubject of curio&s;ity to con&s;ider,
what that circum&s;tance is, in which all the&s;e various
cau&s;es agree; or, in other words, what is the real,
efficient cau&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ion. We &s;hall begin with
pride and humility.</P>
<P>3. IN order to explain the cau&s;es of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions,
we mu&s;t reflect on certain properties, which tho' they
have a mighty influence on every operation, both of
the under&s;tanding and pa&s;&s;ions, are not commonly
much in&s;i&s;ted on by philo&s;ophers. The fir&s;t of the&s;e
is the <HI>a&s;&s;ociation</HI> of ideas, or that principle, by which
we make an ea&s;y tran&s;ition from one idea to another.
However uncertain and changeable our thoughts may
be, they are not entirely without rule and method in
their changes. They u&s;ually pa&s;s with regularity,
from one object, to what re&s;embles it, is contiguous
to it, or produced by it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Enquiry concerning Human Under&s;tanding, Sect. III.</NOTE>. When one idea is pre&s;ent
to the imagination; any other, united by the&s;e rela|tions,
naturally follows it, and enters with more fa|cility,
by means of that introduction.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="259">
THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> property, which I &s;hall ob&s;erve in the
human mind, is a like a&s;&s;ociation of impre&s;&s;ions or
emotions. All <HI>re&s;embling</HI> impre&s;&s;ions are connected
together; and no &s;ooner one ari&s;es, than the re&s;t na|turally
follow. Grief and di&s;appointment give ri&s;e
to anger, anger to envy, envy to malice, and malice
to grief again. In like manner, our temper, when
elevated with joy, naturally throws it&s;elf into love,
genero&s;ity, courage, pride, and other re&s;embling af|fections.</P>
<P>IN
the <HI>third</HI> place, it is ob&s;ervable of the&s;e two
kinds of a&s;&s;ociation, that they very much a&s;&s;i&s;t and
forward each other, and that the tran&s;ition is more
ea&s;ily made, where they both concur in the &s;ame ob|ject.
Thus, a man, who by any injury from another,
is very much di&s;compo&s;ed and ruffled in his temper,
is apt to find a hundred &s;ubjects of hatred, di&s;content,
impatience, fear, and other unea&s;y pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;peci|ally
if he can di&s;cover the&s;e &s;ubjects in or near the
per&s;on, who was the object of his fir&s;t emotion. Tho&s;e
principles which forward the tran&s;ition of ideas, here
concur with tho&s;e, which operate on the pa&s;&s;ions;
and both, uniting in one action, be&s;tow on the mind
a double impul&s;e.</P>
<P>UPON this occa&s;ion, I may cite a pa&s;&s;age from an
elegant writer, who expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the following
manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ADDISON, Spectator, N^o 412.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline">"As the fancy delights in every thing,
<PB N="263" REF="260">
that is great, &s;trange, or beautiful, and is &s;till the
more plea&s;ed the more it finds of the&s;e perfections
in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> object, &s;o it is capable of receiving new
&s;atisfaction by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of another &s;en&s;e. Thus,
any continual found, as the mu&s;ic of birds, or a
fall of waters, awakens every moment the mind
of the beholder, and makes him more attentive to
the &s;everal beauties of the place, that lie before
him. Thus, if there ari&s;es a fragrancy of &s;mells
or perfumes, they heighten the plea&s;ure of the ima|gination,
and make even the colours and verdure
of the land&s;cape appear more agreeable; for the
ideas of both &s;en&s;es recommend each other, and
are plea&s;anter together than where they enter the
mind &s;eparately: As the different colours of a pic|ture,
when they are well di&s;po&s;ed, &s;et off one ano|ther,
and receive an additional beauty from the ad|vantage
of the &s;ituation."</Q> In the&s;e phaenomena,
we may remark the a&s;&s;ociation both of impre&s;&s;ions
and ideas; as well as the mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance the&s;e a&s;&s;o|ciations
lend to each other.</P>
<P>4. IT &s;eems to me, that both the&s;e &s;pecies of rela|tion
have place in producing <HI>Pride</HI> or <HI>Humility,</HI> and
are the real, efficient cau&s;es of the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the fir&s;t relation, that of ideas,
there can be no que&s;tion. Whatever we are proud
of, mu&s;t, in &s;ome manner, belong to us. It is always
<PB N="264" REF="261">
<HI>our</HI> knowlege, <HI>our</HI> &s;en&s;e, beauty, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, family,
on which we value our&s;elves. Self, which is the
<HI>object</HI> of the pa&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t &s;till be related to that qua|lity
or circum&s;tance, which <HI>cau&s;es</HI> the pa&s;&s;ion. There
mu&s;t be a connexion between them; an ea&s;y tran&s;ition
of the imagination; or a facility of the conception in
pa&s;&s;ing from one to the other. Where this connexion
is wanting, no object can either excite pride or hu|mility;
and the more you weaken the connexion, the
more you weaken the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>5. THE only &s;ubject of enquiry is, whether there
be a like relation of impre&s;&s;ions or &s;entiments, where|ever
pride or humility is felt; whether the circum|&s;tance,
which cau&s;es the pa&s;&s;ion, produces antecedently
a &s;entiment &s;imilar to the pa&s;&s;ion; and whether there
be an ea&s;y transfu&s;ion of the one into the other.</P>
<P>THE feeling or &s;entiment of pride is agreeable; of
humility, painful. An agreeable &s;en&s;ation is, there|fore,
related to the former; a painful, to the latter.
And if we find, after examination, that every object,
which produces pride, produces al&s;o a &s;eparate plea|&s;ure;
and every object, that cau&s;es humility, excites
in like manner a &s;eparate unea&s;ine&s;s; we mu&s;t allow,
in that ca&s;e, that the pre&s;ent theory is fully proved
and a&s;certained. The double relation of ideas and
&s;entiments will be acknowleged inconte&s;table.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="262">
6. To begin with per&s;onal merit and demerit, the
mo&s;t obvious cau&s;es of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions; it would be en|tirely
foreign to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to examine the
foundation of moral di&s;tinctions. It is &s;ufficient to
ob&s;erve, that the foregoing theory concerning the
origin of the pa&s;&s;ions may be defended on any hypo|the&s;is.
The mo&s;t probable &s;y&s;tem, which has been
advanced to explain the difference between vice and
virtue, is, that either from a primary con&s;titution of
nature, or from a &s;en&s;e of public or private intere&s;t,
certain characters, upon the very view and contem|plation,
produce unea&s;ine&s;s; and others, in like man|ner,
excite plea&s;ure. The unea&s;ine&s;s and &s;atisfaction,
produced in the &s;pectator, are e&s;&s;ential to vice and
virtue. To approve of a character, is to feel a de|light
upon its appearance. To di&s;approve of it, is to
be &s;en&s;ible of an unea&s;ine&s;s. The pain and plea&s;ure
therefore, being, in a manner, the primary &s;ource of
blame or prai&s;e, mu&s;t al&s;o be the cau&s;es of all their
effects; and con&s;equently, the cau&s;es of pride and
humility, which are the unavoidable attendants of
that di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>BUT &s;upposing this theory of morals &s;hould not
be received; it is &s;till evident that pain and plea|&s;ure,
if not the &s;ources of moral di&s;tinctions, are at
lea&s;t in&s;eparable from them. A generous and noble
character affords a &s;atisfaction even in the &s;urvey;
and when pre&s;ented to us, tho' only in a poem or
<PB N="266" REF="263">
fable, never fails to charm and delight us. On the
other hand, cruelty and treachery di&s;plea&s;e from their
very nature; nor is it po&s;&s;ible ever to reconcile us to
the&s;e qualities, either in our&s;elves or others. Vir|tue,
therefore, produces always a plea&s;ure di&s;tinct
from the pride or &s;elf-&s;atisfaction which attends it:
Vice, an unea&s;ine&s;s &s;eparate from the humility or re|mor&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT
a high or low conceit of our&s;elves ari&s;es not
from tho&s;e qualities alone of the mind, which, ac|cording
to common &s;y&s;tems of ethics, have been de|fined
parts of moral duty; but from any other, which
have a connexion with plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s. No|thing
flatters our vanity more than the talent of plea&s;|ing
by our wit, good-humour, or any other accom|pli&s;hment;
and nothing gives us a more &s;en&s;ible mor|tification,
than a di&s;appointment in any attempt of
that kind. No one has ever been able to tell pre|ci&s;ely,
what <HI>wit</HI> is, and to &s;hew why &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of
thought mu&s;t be received under that denomination,
and &s;uch another rejected. It is by ta&s;te alone we can
decide concerning it; nor are we po&s;&s;e&s;t of any other
&s;tandard, by which we can form a judgment of this
nature. Now what is this <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> from which true and
fal&s;e wit in a manner receive their being, and with|out
which no thought can have a title to either of
the&s;e denominations? It is plainly nothing but a
&s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure from true wit, and of di&s;|gu&s;t
<PB N="267" REF="264">
from fal&s;e, without our being able to tell the
rea&s;ons of that &s;atisfaction or unea&s;ine&s;s. The power
of exciting the&s;e oppo&s;ite &s;en&s;ations is, therefore, the
very e&s;&s;ence of true or fal&s;e wit; and con&s;equently,
the cau&s;e of that vanity or mortification, which ari&s;es
from one or the other.</P>
<P>7. BEAUTY of all kinds gives us a peculiar delight
and &s;atisfaction; as deformity produces pain, upon
whatever &s;ubject it may be placed, and whether &s;ur|veyed
in an animate or inanimate object. If the
beauty or deformity belong to our own face, &s;hape,
or per&s;on, this plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s is converted into
pride or humility; as having in this ca&s;e all the cir|cum&s;tances
requi&s;ite to produce a perfect tran&s;ition,
according to the pre&s;ent theory.</P>
<P>IT would &s;eem, that the very e&s;&s;ence of beauty con|&s;i&s;ts
in its power of producing plea&s;ure. All its ef|fects,
therefore, mu&s;t proceed from this circum&s;tance:
And if beauty is &s;o univer&s;ally the &s;ubject of vanity,
it is only from its being the cau&s;e of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>CONCERNING all other bodily accompli&s;hments,
we may ob&s;erve in general, that whatever in our&s;elves
is either u&s;eful, beautiful, or &s;urprizing, is an object
of pride; and the contrary, of humility. The&s;e qua|lities
agree in producing a &s;eparate plea&s;ure; and agree
in nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="265">
WE are vain of the &s;urprizing adventures which
we have met with, the e&s;capes which we have made,
the dangers to which we have been expo&s;ed; as well
as of our &s;urprizing &s;eats or vigour and activity.
Hence the origin of vulgar lying; where men, with|out
any intere&s;t, and merely out of vanity, heap up
a number of extraordinary events, which are either the
fictions of their brain; or, if true, have no connexion
with them&s;elves. Their fruitful invention &s;upplies
them with a variety of adventures; and where that
talent is wanting, they appropriate &s;uch as belong to
others, in order to gratify their vanity: For between
that pa&s;&s;ion, and the &s;entiment of plea&s;ure, there is
always a clo&s;e connexion.</P>
<P>8. BUT tho' pride and humility have the qualities
of our mind and body, that is, of &s;elf, for their na|tural
and more immediate cau&s;es; we find by experi|ence,
that many other objects produce the&s;e affections.
We found vanity upon hou&s;es, gardens, equipage,
and other external objects; as well as upon per&s;onal
merit and accompli&s;hments. This happens when ex|ternal
objects acquire any particular relation to our|&s;elves,
and are a&s;&s;ociated or connected with us. A
beautiful fi&s;h in the ocean, a well-proportioned ani|mal
in a fore&s;t, and indeed, any thing, which nei|ther
belongs nor is related to us, has no manner of
influence on our vanity; whatever extraordinary qua|lities
it may be endowed with, and whatever degree

<P>MEN are vain of the beauty either of <HI>their</HI> country,
or <HI>their</HI> country, or even of <HI>their</HI> pari&s;h. Here the
idea of beauty plainly produces a plea&s;ure. This
plea&s;ure is related to pride. The object or cau&s;e of
this plea&s;ure is, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, related to &s;elf, the
object of pride. By this double relation of &s;enti|ments
and ideas, a tran&s;ition is made from one to the
other.</P>
<P>MEN are al&s;o vain of the happy temperature of the

their native &s;oil; of the goodne&s;s of the wines, fruits,

of their language, with other particulars of that kind.
The&s;e objects have plainly a reference to the plea&s;ures

to the feeling, ta&s;te, or hearing. How could
they become cau&s;es of pride, except by means of that
tran&s;ition above explained?</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome, who di&s;cover a vanity of an op|po&s;ite

The&s;e per&s;ons find, when they are at
home, and &s;urrounded with their countrymen, that
the &s;trong relation between them and their own nation
is &s;hared with &s;o many, that it is in a manner lo&s;t to
them; whereas, that di&s;tant relation to a foreign
country, which is formed by their having &s;een it, and
lived in it, is augmented by their con&s;idering how
few have done the &s;ame. For this rea&s;on, they al|ways
admire the beauty, utility, and rarity of what
they met with abroad, above what they find at
home.</P>
<P>SINCE we can be vain of a country, climate, or
any inanimate object, which bears a relation to us;
it is no wonder we &s;hould be vain of the qualities of
tho&s;e, who are connected with us by blood or friend|&s;hip.
Accordingly we find, that any qualities which,
when belonging to our&s;elf, produce pride, produce
al&s;o, in a le&s;s degree, the &s;ame affection, when di&s;|covered
in per&s;ons, related to us. The beauty, ad|dre&s;s,
merit, credit, and honours of their kindred are
carefully di&s;played by the proud, and are con&s;iderable
&s;ources of their vanity.</P>
<P>AS we are proud of riches in our&s;elves, we de&s;ire,
in order to gratify our vanity, that every one, who
has any connexion with us, &s;hould likewi&s;e be po&s;|&s;e&s;t
of them, and are a&s;hamed of &s;uch as are mean
<PB N="271" REF="268">
or poor among our friends and relations. Our fore|fathers
being conceived as our neare&s;t relations; every
one naturally affects to be of a good family, and to
be de&s;cended from a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of rich and ho|nourable
ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>THOSE, who boa&s;t of the antiquity of their fami|lies,
are glad when they can join this circum&s;tance,
that their ance&s;tors, for many generations, have been
uninterrupted proprietors of the <HI>&s;ome</HI> portion of land,
and that their family has never changed its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,
or been tran&s;planted into any other county or pro|vince.
It is an additional &s;ubject of vanity, when
they can boa&s;t, that the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions have been tran&s;|mitted
thro' a de&s;cent, compo&s;ed entirely of males,
and that the honours and fortune have never pa&s;&s;ed
thro' any female. Let us endeavour to explain the&s;e
phaenomena from the foregoing theory.</P>
<P>WHEN any one values him&s;elf on the antiquity of
his family the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> are not merely the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> and number <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> ance&s;tors (for in
that respect all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> are alike&punc; but the&s;e circum|&s;tances,
joined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;riches and credit of his ancef|tors,
which are &s;uppo&s;ed to reflect a lu&s;tre on him|&s;elf,
upon account of his connexion with them. Since
therefore the pa&s;&s;ion depends on the connexion, what|ever
&s;trengthens the connexion mu&s;t al&s;o encrea&s;e the
pa&s;&s;ion, and whatever weakens the connexion mu&s;t
<PB N="272" REF="269">
dimini&s;h the pa&s;&s;ion. But 'tis evident, that the &s;ame|ne&s;s
of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions mu&s;t &s;trengthen the relation of
ideas, ari&s;ing from blood and kindred, and convey
the fancy with greater facility from one generation to
another; from the remote&s;t ance&s;tors to their po&s;te|rity,
who are both their heirs and their de&s;cendants.
By this facility, the &s;entiment is tran&s;mitted more en|tire,
and excites a greater degree of pride and vanity.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e is the &s;ame with the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the
honours and fortune, thro' a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of males, with|out
their pa&s;&s;ing thro' any female. It is an obvious
quality of human nature, that the imagination natu|rally
turns to whatever is important and con&s;iderable;
and where two objects are pre&s;ented, a &s;mall and a
great, it u&s;ually leaves the former, and dwells entirely
on the latter. This is the rea&s;on, why children com|monly
bear their father's name, and are e&s;teemed to
be of a nobler or meaner birth, according to <HI>his</HI> fa|mily.
And tho' the mother &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;t of &s;u|perior
qualities to the father, as often happens, the
<HI>general rule</HI> prevails, notwith&s;tanding the exception,
according to the doctrine, which &s;hall be explained
afterwards. Nay, even when a &s;uperiorty of any
kind is &s;o great, or when any other rea&s;ons have
&s;uch an effect, as to make the children rather repre|&s;ent
the mother's family than the father's, the general
rule &s;till retains an efficacy, &s;ufficient to weaken the
relation, and make a kind of breach in the line of
<PB N="273" REF="270">
ance&s;tors. The imagination runs not along them with
the &s;ame facility, nor is able to tranfer the honour
and credit of the ance&s;tors to their po&s;terity of the
&s;ame name and family &s;o readily, as when the tran|&s;ition
is conformable to the general rule, and pa&s;&s;es
thro' the male line, from father to &s;on, or from bro|ther
to brother.</P>
<P>9. BUT <HI>property,</HI> as it gives us the fulle&s;t power
and authority over any object, is the relation, which
has the greate&s;t influence on the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That property is a &s;pecies of <HI>relation,</HI> which produces a con|nexion between the per&s;on and the object is evident: The ima|gination pa&s;&s;es naturally and ea&s;ily from the con&s;ideration of a field to that of the per&s;on, whom it belongs to. It may only be a&s;ked, how this relation is re&s;olveable into any of tho&s;e three, viz. <HI>cau&s;ation, contiguity</HI> and <HI>re&s;emblance,</HI> which we have affirmed to be the &s;ole connecting principles among ideas. To be the pro|prietor of any thing is to be the &s;ole per&s;on, who, by the laws of &s;ociety, has a right to di&s;po&s;e of it, and to enjoy the benefit of it. This right has at lea&s;t a tendency to procure the per&s;on the exerci&s;e of it; and in fact does commonly procure him that advantage. For rights which had no influence, and never took place, would be no rights at all. Now a per&s;on who di&s;po&s;es of an object, and reaps benefit from it, both produces, or may pro|duce, effects on it, and is affected by it. Property therefore is a &s;pecies of <HI>cau&s;ation.</HI> It enables the per&s;on to produce alterations on the object, and it &s;uppo&s;es that his condition is improved and altered by it. It is indeed the relation the mo&s;t intere&s;ting of any, and occurs the mo&s;t frequently to the mind.</NOTE>.</P>

EVERY thing, belonging to a vain man, is the be&s;t
that is any where to be found. His hou&s;es, equipage,
furniture, cloaths, hor&s;es, hounds, excel all others in
his conceit; and it is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that, from the
lea&s;t advantage in any of the&s;e, he draws a new &s;ub|ject
of pride and vanity. His wine, if you will be|lieve
him, has a finer flavour than any other; his
cookery is more exqui&s;ite; his table more orderly; his
&s;ervants more expert; the air, in which he lives, more
healthful; the &s;oil, which he cultivates, more fertile;
his fruits ripen earlier, and to greater perfection:
Such a thing is remarkable for its novelty; &s;uch ano|ther
for its antiquity: This is the workman&s;hip of
a famous arti&s;t; that belonged once to &s;uch a prince

beautiful, or &s;urprizing, or are related to &s;uch,
may, by means of property, give ri&s;e to this pa&s;&s;ion.
The&s;e all agree in giving plea&s;ure. This alone is
common to them; and therefore mu&s;t be the quality,
that produces the pa&s;&s;ion, which is their common
effect. As every new in&s;tance is a new argument,

would &s;eem, that this theory is &s;ufficiently confirmed

10. OUR opinions of all kinds are &s;trongly affected
by &s;ociety and &s;ympathy, and it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible
for us to &s;upport any principle or &s;entiment, again&s;t
the univer&s;al con&s;ent of every one, with whom we
have any friend&s;hip or corre&s;pondence. But of all our
opinions, tho&s;e, which we form in our own favour;
however lofty or pre&s;uming; are at bottom, the frail|e&s;t,
and the mo&s;t ea&s;ily &s;haken by the contradiction
and oppo&s;ition of others. Our great concern, in this
ca&s;e, makes us &s;oon alarmed, and keeps our pa&s;&s;ions
upon the watch: Our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of partiality &s;till
makes us dread a mi&s;take: And the very difficulty of
judging concerning an object, which is never &s;et at
a due di&s;tance from us, nor is &s;een in a proper point
of view, makes us hearken anxiou&s;ly to the opinions
of others, who are better qualified to form ju&s;t opi|nions
concerning us. Hence that &s;trong love of fame,
with which all mankind are po&s;&s;e&s;t. It is in order to
fix and confirm their favourable opinion of them&s;elves,
not from any original pa&s;&s;ion, that they &s;eek the ap|plau&s;es
of others. And when a man de&s;ires to be
prai&s;ed, it is for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that a beauty is
plea&s;ed with &s;urveying her&s;elf in a favourable look|ing-gla&s;s,
and &s;eeing the reflexion of her own
charms.</P>
<P>THO' it be difficult in all points of &s;peculation

in any other, it is ea&s;ily accounted for from the na|ture
of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="274">
11. THUS few objects, however related to us, and
whatever plea&s;ure they produce, are able to excite a great
degree of pride or &s;elf &s;atisfaction; unle&s;s they be al&s;o
obvious to others, and engage the approbation of the
&s;pectators. What di&s;po&s;ition of mind &s;o de&s;irable as
the peaceful, re&s;igned, contented; which readily &s;ub|mits
to all the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, and pre|&s;erves
a con&s;tant &s;erenity amid&s;t the greate&s;t misfor|tunes
and di&s;appointments? Yet this di&s;po&s;ition, tho'
acknowleged to be a virtue or excellence, is &s;eldom
the foundation of great vanity or &s;elf-applau&s;e; hav|ing
no brilliancy or exterior lu&s;tre, and rather cheer|ing
the heart, than animating the behaviour and con|ver&s;ation.
The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with many other
qualities of the mind, body, or fortune; and this cir|cum&s;tance,
as well as the double relations above men|tioned,
mu&s;t be admitted to be of con&s;equence in the
production of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>A SECOND circum&s;tance, which is of con&s;equence
in this affair, is the con&s;tancy and duration of the ob|ject.
What is very ca&s;ual and incon&s;tant, beyond
the common cour&s;e of human affairs, gives little joy,
and le&s;s pride. We are not much &s;atisfied with the
thing it&s;elf; and are &s;till le&s;s apt to feel any new de|gree
of &s;elf-&s;atisfaction upon its account. We fore&s;ee
and anticipate its change; which makes us little &s;a|tisfied
with the thing it&s;elf: We compare it to our|&s;elves,
who&s;e exi&s;tence is more durable; by which
<PB N="278" REF="275">
means its incon&s;tancy appears &s;till greater. It &s;eems
ridiculous to make our&s;elves the object of a pa&s;&s;ion,
on account of a quality or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which is of &s;o
much &s;horter duration, and attends us during &s;o &s;mall
a part of our exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>A THIRD circum&s;tance, not to be neglected, is,
that the objects, in order to produce pride or &s;elf-value,
mu&s;t be peculiar to us, or at lea&s;t, common to
us with a few others. The advantages of &s;un-&s;hine,
good weather, a happy climate, &amp;c. di&s;tingui&s;h us not
from any of our companions, and give us no prefer|ence
or &s;uperiority. The compari&s;on which we are
every moment apt to make, pre&s;ents no inference to
our advantage; and we &s;till remain, notwith&s;tanding
the&s;e enjoyments, on a level with all our friends and
acquaintance.</P>
<P>AS health and &s;ickne&s;s vary ince&s;&s;antly to all men,
and there is no one, who is &s;olely or certainly fixed
in either; the&s;e accidental ble&s;&s;ings and calamities are
in a manner &s;eparated from us, and are not con|&s;idered
as a foundation for vanity or humiliation. But
wherever a malady of any kind is &s;o rooted in our
con&s;titution, that we no longer entertain any hopes
of recovery, from that moment it damps our &s;elf-conceit,
as is evident in old men, whom nothing
mortifies more than the con&s;ideration of their age and
infirmities. They endeavour, as long as po&s;&s;ible, to
<PB N="279" REF="276">
conceal their blindne&s;s and deafne&s;s, their rheums
and gouts; nor do they ever avow them without re|luctance
and unea&s;ine&s;s. And tho' young men are
not a&s;hamed of every head-ach or cold which they
fall into; yet no topic is more proper to mortify hu|man
pride, and make us entertain a mean opinion of
our nature, than this, that we are every moment of
our lives &s;ubject to &s;uch infirmities. This proves,
that bodily pain and &s;ickne&s;s are in them&s;elves proper
cau&s;es of humility; tho' the cu&s;tom of e&s;timating
every thing, by compari&s;on, more than by its intrin&s;ic
worth and value, makes us overlook tho&s;e calamities,
which we find incident to every one, and cau&s;es us to
form an idea of our merit and character, independent
of them.</P>
<P>WE are a&s;hamed of &s;uch maladies as affect others,
and are either dangerous or di&s;agreeable to them. Of
the epilep&s;y; becau&s;e it gives a horror to every one
pre&s;ent: Of the itch; becau&s;e it is infectious: Of the
king's evil; becau&s;e it often goes to po&s;terity. Men
always con&s;ider the &s;entiments of others in their judg|ment
of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>A FOURTH circum&s;tance, which has an influence
on the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, is <HI>general rules;</HI> by which we form
a notion of different ranks of men, &s;uitable to the
power or riches of which they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and this
notion is not changed by any peculiarities of the health
<PB N="280" REF="277">
or temper of the per&s;ons, which may deprive them
of all enjoyment in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Cu&s;tom readily
carries us beyond the ju&s;t bounds in our pa&s;&s;ions, as
well as in our rea&s;onings.</P>
<P>IT may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve on this occa&s;ion,
that the influence of general rules and maxims on the
pa&s;&s;ions very much contributes to facilitate the effects
of all the principles or internal mechani&s;m, which we
here explain. For it &s;eems evident, that, if a per|&s;on
full grown, and of the &s;ame nature with our&s;elves'
were on a &s;udden tran&s;ported into our world, he would
be very much embarra&s;&s;ed with every object, and
would not readily determine what degree of love or
hatred, of pride or humility, or of any other pa&s;&s;ion
&s;hould be excited by it. The pa&s;&s;ions are often varied
by very incon&s;iderable principles; and the&s;e do not
always play with perfect regularity, e&s;pecially on the
fir&s;t trial. But as cu&s;tom or practice has brought to
light all the&s;e principles, and has &s;ettled the ju&s;t va|lue
of every thing; this mu&s;t certainly contribute to
the ea&s;y production of the pa&s;&s;ions, and guide us, by
means of general e&s;tabli&s;hed rules, in the proportions,
which we ought to ob&s;erve in prefering one object
to another. This remark may, perhaps, &s;erve to ob|viate
difficulties, that may ari&s;e concerning &s;ome
cau&s;es, which we here a&s;cribe to particular pa&s;&s;ions,
and which may be e&s;teemed too refined to operate
&s;o univer&s;ally and certainly, as they are found to
do.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>1. IN running over all the cau&s;es, which produce
the pa&s;&s;ion of pride or that of humility; it would
readily occur, that the &s;ame circum&s;tance, if tansfer|red
from our&s;elf to another per&s;on, would render him
the object of love or hatred, e&s;teem or contempt. The
virtue, genius, beauty, family, riches, and authority
of others beget favourable &s;entiments in their behalf;
and their vice, folly, deformity, poverty and mean|ne&s;s
excite the contrary &s;entiments. The double re|lation
of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas &s;till operates on the&s;e
pa&s;&s;ions of love and hatred; as on the former of pride
and humility. Whatever gives a &s;eparate plea&s;ure or
pain, and is related to another per&s;on or connected
with him, makes him the object of our affection or
di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>HENCE too injury or contempt is one of the greate&s;t
&s;ources of hatred; &s;ervices or e&s;teem, of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>2. SOMETIMES a relation to our&s;elf excites affection
towards any per&s;on. But there is always here im|plied
a realtion of &s;entiments, without which the other
relation would have no influence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The affection of parents to children &s;eems founded on an original in&s;tinct. The affection towards other relations depends on the principles here explained.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="279">
A PERSON, who is related to us, or connected with
us, by blood, by &s;imilitude of fortune, of adventures,
profe&s;&s;ion, or country, &s;oon becomes an agreeable com|panion
to us; becau&s;e we enter ea&s;ily and familiarly
into his &s;entiments and conceptions: Nothing is &s;trange
or new to us: Our imagination, pa&s;&s;ing from &s;elf,
which is ever intimately pre&s;ent to us, runs &s;moothly
along the relation or connexion, and conceives with
a full &s;ympathy the per&s;on, who is nearly related to
&s;elf. He renders him&s;elf immediately acceptable, and
is at once on an ea&s;y &s;ooting with us: No di&s;tance,
no re&s;erve has place, where the per&s;on introduced is
&s;uppo&s;ed &s;o clo&s;ely connected with us.</P>
<P>RELATION has here the &s;ame influence as cu&s;tom
or acquaintance, in exciting affection; and from like
cau&s;es. The ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction, which, in both
ca&s;es, attend our intercour&s;e or commerce, is the
&s;ource of the friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>3. The pa&s;&s;ions of love and hatred are always fol|lowed
by, or rather conjoined with, benevolence and
anger. It is this conjunction, which chiefly di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
the&s;e affections, from pride and humility. For
pride and humility are pure emotions in the &s;oul, un|attended
with any de&s;ire, and not immediately excit|ing
us to action. But love and hatred are not com|pleat
within them&s;elves, nor re&s;t in that emotion, which
they produce; but carry the mind to &s;omething far|ther.
<PB N="283" REF="280">
Love is always followed by a de&s;ire of hap|pine&s;s
to the per&s;on beloved, and an aver&s;ion to his
mi&s;ery: As hatred produces a de&s;ire of the mi&s;ery,
and an aver&s;ion to the happine&s;s of the per&s;on hated.
The&s;e oppo&s;ite de&s;ires &s;eem to be originally and pri|marily
conjoined with the pa&s;&s;ion of love and hatred.
It is a con&s;titution of nature, of which we can give
no farther explication.</P>
<P>4. COMPASSION frequently ari&s;es, where there is
no preceding e&s;teem or friend&s;hip; and compa&s;&s;ion is
an unea&s;ine&s;s in the &s;ufferings of another. It &s;eems
to &s;pring from the intimate and &s;trong conception of
his &s;ufferings; and our imagination proceeds by de|grees,
from the lively idea, to the real feeling of
another's mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>MALICE and envy al&s;o ari&s;e in the mind without
any preceding hatred or injury; tho' their tendency
is exactly the &s;ame with that of anger and ill will.
The compari&s;on of our&s;elves with others &s;eems the
&s;ource of envy and malice. The more unhappy ano|ther
is, the more happy do we our&s;elves appear in
our own conception.</P>
<P>5. THE &s;imilar tendency of compa&s;&s;ion to that of
benevolence, and of envy to anger, forms a very clo&s;e

a re&s;emblance of feeling or &s;entiment, but a re&s;em|blance
of tendency or direction. Its effect, however,
is the &s;ame, in producing an a&s;&s;ociation of pa&s;&s;ions.
Compa&s;&s;ion is &s;eldom or never felt without &s;ome mix|ture
of tenderne&s;s or friend&s;hip; and envy is naturally
accompanied with anger or ill will. To de&s;ire the
happine&s;s of another, from whatever motive, is a
good preparative to affection: and to delight in ano|ther's
mi&s;ery almo&s;t unavoidably begets aver&s;ion to|wards
him.</P>
<P>EVEN where intere&s;t is the &s;ource of our concern,
it is commonly attended with the &s;ame con&s;equences.
A partner is a natural object of friend&s;hip; a rival of
enmity.</P>
<P>6. POVERTY, meanne&s;s, di&s;appointment, produce
contempt and di&s;like: But when the&s;e misfortunes
are very great, or are repre&s;ented to us in very &s;trong
colours, they excite compa&s;&s;ion, and tenderne&s;s, and
friend&s;hip. How is this contradiction to be accounted
for? The poverty and meanne&s;s of another, in their
common appearance, gives us unea&s;ine&s;s, by a &s;pecies
of imperfect &s;ympathy; and this unea&s;ine&s;s produces
aver&s;ion or di&s;like, from the re&s;emblance of &s;entiment.
But when we enter more intimately into another's
concerns, and wi&s;h for his happine&s;s, as well as feel
his mi&s;ery, friend&s;hip or good-will ari&s;es, from the
&s;imilar tendency of the inclinations.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="282">
7. IN re&s;pect, there is a mixture of humility,
with the e&s;teem or affection: In contempt, a mix|ture
of pride.</P>
<P>THE amorous pa&s;&s;ion is u&s;ually compounded of
complacency in beauty, a bodily appetite, and friend|&s;hip
or affection. The clo&s;e relation of the&s;e &s;enti|ments
is very obvious, as well as their origin from
each other, by means of that relation. Were there
no other phaenomenon to reconcile us to the pre&s;ent
theory, this alone, methinks, were &s;ufficient.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<P>1. THE pre&s;ent theory of the pa&s;&s;ions depends en|tirely
on the double relations of &s;entiments and ideas,
and the mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which the&s;e relations lend to
each other. It may not, therefore, be improper to
illu&s;trate the&s;e principles by &s;ome farther in&s;tances.</P>
<P>2. THE virtues, talents, accompli&s;hments, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions
of others, make us love and e&s;teem them:
Becau&s;e the&s;e objects excite a plea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation, which
is related to love; and as they have al&s;o a relation or
connexion with the per&s;on, this union of ideas for|wards
the union of &s;entiments, according to the fore|going
rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e, that the per&s;on, whom we love, is
al&s;o related to us, by blood, country, or friend&s;hip;
<PB N="286" REF="283">
it is evident, that a &s;pecies of pride mu&s;t al&s;o be ex|cited
by his accompli&s;hments and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; there
being the &s;ame double relation, which we have all
along in&s;i&s;ted on. The per&s;on is related to us, or
there is an ea&s;y tran&s;ition of thought from him to us;
and the &s;entiments, excited by his advantages and
virtues, are agreeable, and con&s;equently related to
pride. Accordingly we find, that people are natu|rally
vain of the good qualities or high fortune of
their friends and countrymen.</P>
<P>3. BUT it is ob&s;ervable, that, if we rever&s;e the
order of the pa&s;&s;ions, the &s;ame effect does not follow.
We pa&s;s ea&s;ily from love and affection to pride and
vanity; but not from the latter pa&s;&s;ions to the former,
tho' all the relations be the &s;ame. We love not tho&s;e
related to us on account of our own merit; tho' they
are naturally vain on account of our merit. What is
the rea&s;on of this difference? The tran&s;ition of the
imagination to our&s;elves, from objects related to us,
is always very ea&s;y; both on account of the relation,
which facilitates the tran&s;ition, and becau&s;e we there
pa&s;s from remoter objects, to tho&s;e which are con|tiguous.
But in pa&s;&s;ing from our&s;elves to objects, re|lated
to us; tho' the former principle forwards the
tran&s;ition of thought, yet the latter oppo&s;es it; and
con&s;equently there is not the &s;ame ea&s;y transfu&s;ion
of pa&s;&s;ions from pride to love as from love to pride.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="284">
4. THE virtues, &s;ervices, and fortune of one man
in&s;pire us readily with e&s;teem and affection for ano|ther
related to him. The &s;on of our friend is natu|rally
entitled to our friend&s;hip: The kindred of a
very great man value them&s;elves, and are valued by
others, on account of that relation. The force of
the double relation is here fully di&s;played.</P>
<P>5. THE following are in&s;tances of another kind,
where the operation of the&s;e principles may &s;till be
di&s;covered. Envy ari&s;es from a &s;uperiority in others;
but it is ob&s;ervable, that it is not the great di&s;pro|portion
between us, which excites that pa&s;&s;ion, but on
the contrary, our proximity. A great di&s;proportion
cuts off the relation of the ideas, and either keeps
us from comparing our&s;elves with what is remote
from us, or dimini&s;hes the effects of the compa|ri&s;on.</P>
<P>A POET is not apt to envy a philo&s;opher, or a poet
of a different kind, of a different nation, or of a dif|ferent
age. All the&s;e differences, if they do not pre|vent,
at lea&s;t weaken the compari&s;on, and con&s;e|quently
the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THIS too is the rea&s;on, why all objects appear great
or little, merely by a compari&s;on with tho&s;e of the
&s;ame &s;pecies. A mountain neither magnifies nor di|mini&s;hes
a hor&s;e in our eyes: But when a FLEMISH
and a WELSH hor&s;e are &s;een together, the one ap|pears
<PB N="288" REF="285">
greater and the other le&s;s, than when viewed
apart.</P>
<P>FROM the &s;ame principle we may account for that
remark of hi&s;torians, that any party, in a civil war,
or even factious divi&s;ion, always choo&s;e to call in a
foreign enemy at any hazard rather than &s;ubmit to
their fellow-citizens. GUICCIARDIN applies this re|mark
to the wars in ITALY; where the relations be|tween
the different &s;tates are, properly &s;peaking, no|thing
but of name, language, and contiguity. Yet
even the&s;e relations, when joined with &s;uperiority, by
making the compari&s;on more natural, make it like|wi&s;e
more grievous, and cau&s;e men to &s;earch for &s;ome
other &s;uperiority, which may be attended with no
relation, and by that means, may have a le&s;s &s;en&s;ible
influence on the imagination. When we cannot break
the a&s;&s;ociation, we feel a &s;tronger de&s;ire to remove the
&s;uperiority. This &s;eems to be the rea&s;on, why tra|vellers,
tho' commonly lavi&s;h of their prai&s;es to the
CHINESE and PERSIANS, take care to depreciate
tho&s;e neighbouring nations, which may &s;tand upon a
footing of rival&s;hip with their native country.</P>
<P>6. THE fine arts afford us parallel in&s;tances. Should
an author compo&s;e a treati&s;e, of which one part was
&s;erious and profound, another light and humorous;
every one would condemn &s;o &s;trange a mixture, and
would blame him for the neglect of all rules of art
<PB N="289" REF="286">
and critici&s;m. Yet we accu&s;e not PRIOR for joining
his <HI>Alma</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> in the &s;ame volume; though
that amiable poet has &s;ucceeded perfectly in the
gaiety of the one, as well as in the melancholy of
the other. Even &s;uppo&s;e the reader &s;hould peru&s;e
the&s;e two compo&s;itions without any interval, he
would feel little or no difficulty in the change of the
pa&s;&s;ions. Why? but becau&s;e he con&s;iders the&s;e per|formances
as entirely different; and by that break in
the ideas, breaks the progre&s;s of the affections, and
hinders the one from influencing or contradicting the
other.</P>
<P>AN heroic and burle&s;que de&s;ign, united in one
picture, would be mon&s;trous; though we place two
pictures of &s;o oppo&s;ite a character in the &s;ame cham|ber,
and even clo&s;e together, without any &s;cruple.</P>
<P>7. IT needs be no matter of wonder, that the ea&s;y
tran&s;ition of the imagination &s;hould have &s;uch an influ|ence
on all the pa&s;&s;ions. It is this very circum&s;tance,
which forms all the relations and connexions among&s;t
objects. We know no real connection between one
thing and another. We know only, that the idea of
one thing is a&s;&s;ociated with that of another, and that
the imagination makes an ea&s;y tran&s;ition between
them. And as the ea&s;y tran&s;ition of ideas, and that
of &s;entiments mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t each other; we might
beforehand expect, that this principle mu&s;t have a
<PB N="290" REF="287">
mighty influence on all our internal movements and
affections. And experience &s;ufficiently confirms the
theory.</P>
<P>FOR, not to repeat all the foregoing in&s;tances:
Suppo&s;e, that I were travelling with a companion
through a country, to which we are both utter &s;tran|gers;
it is evident, that, if the pro&s;pects be beautiful,
the roads agreeable, and the fields finely cultivated;
this may &s;erve to put me in good humour, both with
my&s;elf and fellow-traveller. But as the country has
no connexion with my&s;elf or friend, it can never be
the immediate cau&s;e either of &s;elf-value or of regard
to him: And therefore, if I found not the pa&s;&s;ion on
&s;ome other object, which bears to one of us a clo&s;er
relation, my emotions are rather to be con&s;idered as
the overflowings of an elevated or humane di&s;po&s;ition,
than as an e&s;tabli&s;hed pa&s;&s;ion. But &s;uppo&s;ing the
agreeable pro&s;pect before us to be &s;urveyed either
from his country-&s;eat or from mine; this new con|nexion
of ideas gives a new direction to the &s;entiment
of plea&s;ure, proceeding from the pro&s;pect, and rai&s;es
the emotion of regard or vanity, according to the na|ture
of the connection. There is not here, methinks,
much room for doubt or difficulty.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<PB N="291" REF="288">
<HEAD>SECT. V.</HEAD>
<P>1. IT &s;eems evident, that rea&s;on, in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e,
as meaning the judgment of truth and fal&s;ehood, can
never, of it&s;elf, be any motive to the will, and can
have no influence but &s;o far as it touches &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion
or affection. <HI>Ab&s;tract relations</HI> of ideas are the object
of curio&s;ity, not of volition. And <HI>matters of fact,</HI>
where they are neither good nor evil, where they
neither excite de&s;ire nor aver&s;ion, are totally indiffe|rent;
and whether known or unknown, whether
mi&s;taken or rightly apprehended, cannot be regarded
as any motive to action.</P>
<P>2. WHAT is commonly, in a popular &s;en&s;e, called
rea&s;on, and is &s;o much recommended in moral di&s;|cour&s;es,
is nothing but a general and a calm pa&s;&s;ion,
which takes a comprehen&s;ive and a di&s;tant view of its
object, and actuates the will, without exciting any
&s;en&s;ible emotion. A man, we &s;ay, is diligent in his
profe&s;&s;ion from rea&s;on; that is, from a calm de&s;ire
of riches and a fortune. A man adheres to ju&s;tice
from rea&s;on; that is, from a calm regard to public
good, or to a character with him&s;elf and others.</P>
<P>3. THE &s;ame objects, which recommend them|&s;elves
to rea&s;on in this &s;en&s;e of the word, are al&s;o the
objects of what we call pa&s;&s;ion, when they are brought
<PB N="292" REF="289">
near to us, and acquire &s;ome other advantages, either
of external &s;ituation, or congruity to our internal
temper; and by that means, excite a turbulent and
&s;en&s;ible emotion. Evil, at a great di&s;tance, is a|voided,
we &s;ay, from rea&s;on: Evil, near at hand,
produces aver&s;ion, horror, fear, and is the object of
pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>4. THE common error of metaphy&s;icians has lain
in a&s;cribing the direction of the will entirely to one
of the&s;e principles, and &s;uppo&s;ing the other to have
no influence. Men often act knowingly again&s;t their
intere&s;t: It is not therefore the view of the greate&s;t
po&s;&s;ible good which always influences them. Men
often counteract a violent pa&s;&s;ion, in pro&s;ecution of
their di&s;tant intere&s;ts and de&s;igns: It is not therefore
the pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s alone, which determines them.
In general, we may ob&s;erve, that both the&s;e princi|ples
operate on the will; and where they are contra|ry,
that either of them prevails, according to the ge|neral
character or pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the per&s;on.
What we call <HI>&s;trength of mind</HI> implies the prevalence
of the calm pa&s;&s;ions above the violent; though we
may ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, that there is no per&s;on &s;o con|&s;tantly
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this virtue, as never, on any oc|ca&s;ion,
to yield to the &s;ollicitation of violent affec|tions
and de&s;ires. From the&s;e variations of temper
proceeds the great difficulty of deciding concerning
<PB N="293" REF="290">
the future actions and re&s;olutions of men, where
there is any contrariety of motives and pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VI.</HEAD>
<P>1. WE &s;hall here enumerate &s;ome of tho&s;e circum|&s;tances,
which render a pa&s;&s;ion calm or violent, which
heighten or dimini&s;h any emotion.</P>
<P>IT is a property in human nature, that any emo|tion,
which attends a pa&s;&s;ion, is ea&s;ily converted into
it; though in their natures they be originally diffe|rent
from, and even contrary to each other. It is
true, in order to cau&s;e a perfect union among&s;t pa&s;|&s;ions,
and make one produce the other, there is al|ways
required a double relation, according to the
theory above delivered. But when two pa&s;&s;ions are
already produced by their &s;eparate cau&s;es, and are
both pre&s;ent in the mind, they readily mingle and
unite; though they have but one relation, and &s;ome|times
without any. The predominant pa&s;&s;ion &s;wallows
up the inferior, and converts it into it&s;elf. The
&s;pirits, when once excited, ea&s;ily receive a change in
their direction; and it is natural to imagine, that this
change will come from the prevailing affection. The
connection is in many ca&s;es clo&s;er between any two
pa&s;&s;ions, than between any pa&s;&s;ion and indiffe|rence.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="291">
WHEN a per&s;on is once heartily in love, the little
faults and caprices of his mi&s;tre&s;s, the jealou&s;ies and
quarrels, to which that commerce is &s;o &s;ubject; how|ever
unplea&s;ant they be, and rather connected with
anger and hatred; are yet found, in many in&s;tances,
to give additional force to the prevailing pa&s;&s;ion. It
is a common artifice of politicians, when they would
affect any per&s;on very much by a matter of fact, of
which they intend to inform him, fir&s;t to excite his
curio&s;ity; delay as long as po&s;&s;ible the &s;atisfying it;
and by that means rai&s;e his anxiety and impatience to
the utmo&s;t, before they give him a full in&s;ight into
the bu&s;ine&s;s. They know, that this curio&s;ity will pre|cipitate
him into the pa&s;&s;ion, which they purpo&s;e to
rai&s;e, and will a&s;&s;i&s;t the object in its influence on the
mind. A &s;oldier, advancing to battle, is naturally
in&s;pired with courage and confidence, when he
thinks on his friends and fellow-&s;oldiers; and is
&s;truck with fear and terror, when he reflects on
the enemy. Whatever new emotion, therefore,
proceeds from the former, naturally encrea&s;es the
courage; as the &s;ame emotion proceeding from the
latter, augments the fear. Hence in martial di&s;ci|pline,
the uniformity and lu&s;tre of habit, the regu|larity
of figures and motions, with all the pomp and
maje&s;ty of war, encourage our&s;elves and our allies;
while the &s;ame objects in the enemy &s;trike terror into
us, though agreeable and beautiful in them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="292">
HOPE is, in it&s;elf, an agreeable pa&s;&s;ion, and allied
to friend&s;hip and benevolence; yet is it able &s;ometimes
to blow up anger, when that is the predominant pa&s;|&s;ion.
<HI>Spes addita &s;u&s;citat iras.</HI> VIRG.</P>
<P>2. SINCE pa&s;&s;ions, however independent, are na|turally
transfu&s;ed into each other, if they are both
pre&s;ent at the &s;ame time; it follows, that when good
or evil is placed in &s;uch a &s;ituation as to cau&s;e any par|ticular
emotion, be&s;ides its direct pa&s;&s;ion of de&s;ire or
aver&s;ion, that latter pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t acquire new force
and violence.</P>
<P>3. THIS often happens, when any object excites
contrary pa&s;&s;ions. For it is ob&s;ervable, that an op|po&s;ition
of pa&s;&s;ions commonly cau&s;es a new emotion
in the &s;pirits, and produces more di&s;order than the
concurrence of any two affections of equal force.
This new emotion is ea&s;ily converted into the predo|minant
pa&s;&s;ion, and in many in&s;tances, is ob&s;erved to
encrea&s;e its violence, beyond the pitch, at which it
would have arrived, had it met with no oppo&s;ition.
Hence we naturally de&s;ire what is forbid, and often
take a plea&s;ure in performing actions, merely becau&s;e
they are unlawful. The notion of duty, when oppo|&s;ite
to the pa&s;&s;ions, is not always able to overcome
them; and when it fails of that influence, is apt ra|ther
to increa&s;e and irritate them, by producing an
oppo&s;ition in our motives and principles.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="293">
4. THE &s;ame effect follows, whether the oppo&s;i|tion
ari&s;es from internal motives or external ob&s;tacles.
The pa&s;&s;ion commonly acquires new force in both
ca&s;es. The efforts, which the mind makes to &s;ur|mount
the ob&s;tacle, excite the &s;pirits, and enliven the
pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>5. UNCERTAINTY has the &s;ame effect as oppo&s;i|tion.
The agitation of the thought, the quick turns
which it makes from one view to another, the variety
of pa&s;&s;ions which &s;ucceed each other, according to the
different views: All the&s;e produce an emotion in the
mind, and this emotion transfu&s;es it&s;elf into the pre|dominant
pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>SECURITY, on the contrary, dimini&s;hes the pa&s;|&s;ions.
The mind, when le&s;t to it&s;elf, immediately
langui&s;hes; and in order to pre&s;erve its ardor, mu&s;t
be every moment &s;upported by a new flow of pa&s;&s;ion.
For the &s;ame rea&s;on, de&s;pair, though contrary to &s;e|curity,
has a like influence.</P>
<P>6. NOTHING more powerfully excites any affection
than to conceal &s;ome part of its object, by throwing
it into a kind of &s;hade, which, at the &s;ame time,
that it &s;hows enough to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s us in favour of the
object, leaves &s;till &s;ome work for the imagination.
Be&s;ides, that ob&s;curity is always attended with a kind
<PB N="297" REF="294">
of uncertainty; the effort, which the fancy makes to
compleat the idea, rouzes the &s;pirits, and gives an
additional force to the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>7. AS de&s;pair and &s;ecurity, though contrary, pro|duce
the &s;ame effects; &s;o ab&s;ence is ob&s;erved to have
contrary effects, and in different circum&s;tances, either
encrea&s;es or dimini&s;hes our affection. ROCHEFOU|CAULT
has very well remarked, that ab&s;ence de&s;troys
weak pa&s;&s;ions, but encrea&s;es &s;trong; as the wind ex|tingui&s;hes
a candle, but blows up a fire. Long ab|&s;ence
naturally weakens our idea, and dimini&s;hes the
pa&s;&s;ion: But where the pa&s;&s;ion is &s;o &s;trong and lively
as to &s;upport it&s;elf, the unea&s;ine&s;s, ari&s;ing from ab|&s;ence,
encrea&s;es the pa&s;&s;ion, and gives it new force
and influence.</P>
<P>8. WHEN the &s;oul applies it&s;elf to the performance
of any action, or the conception of any object, to
which it is not accu&s;tomed, there is a certain unpli|ablene&s;s
in the faculties, and a difficulty of the &s;pirits
moving in their new direction. As this difficulty
excites the &s;pirits, it is the &s;ource of wonder, &s;ur|prize,
and of all the emotion, which ari&s;e from
novelty; and is in it&s;elf, very agreeable, like every
thing, which inlivens the mind to a moderate degree.
But though &s;urpri&s;e be agreeable in it&s;elf, yet as it puts
the &s;pirits in agitation, it not only augments our
agreeable affections, but al&s;o our painful, according
<PB N="298" REF="295">
to the foregoing principle. Hence every thing, that
is new, is mo&s;t affecting, and gives us either more
plea&s;ure or pain, than what, &s;trictly &s;peaking, &s;hould
naturally follow from it. When it often returns upon
us, the novelty wears off; the pa&s;&s;ions &s;ub&s;ide; the
hurry of the &s;pirits is over; and we &s;urvey the object
with greater tranquillity.</P>
<P>9. THE imagination and affections have a clo&s;e
union together. The vivacity of the former, gives
force to the latter. Hence the pro&s;pect of any plea|&s;ure,
with which we are acquainted, affects us more
than any other plea&s;ure, which we may own &s;uperior,
but of who&s;e nature we are <HI>wholly</HI> ignorant. Of the
one we can form a particular and determinate idea:
The other, we conceive under the general notion of
plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>ANY &s;atisfaction, which we lately enjoyed, and of
which the memory is fre&s;h and recent, operates on the
will with more violence, than another of which the
traces are decayed and almo&s;t obliterated.</P>
<P>A PLEASURE, which is &s;uitable to the way of life,
in which we are engaged, excites more our de&s;ires
and appetites than another, which is foreign to
it.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="296">
NOTHING is more capable of infu&s;ing any pa&s;&s;ion
into the mind, than eloquence, by which objects are
repre&s;ented in the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t lively colours.
The bare opinion of another, e&s;pecially when inforced
with pa&s;&s;ion, will cau&s;e an idea to have an influence
upon us, though that idea might otherwi&s;e have been
entirely neglected.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that lively pa&s;&s;ions commonly
attend a lively imagination. In this re&s;pect, as well
as others, the force of the pa&s;&s;ion depends as
much on the temper of the per&s;on, as on the nature
and &s;ituation of the object.</P>
<P>WHAT is di&s;tant, either in place or time, has not
equal influence with what is near and contiguous.</P>
<P>I PRETEND not here to have exhau&s;ted this &s;ubject.
It is &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e, if I have made it ap|pear,
that in the production and conduct of the pa&s;|&s;ions,
there is a certain regular mechani&s;m, which is
&s;u&s;ceptible of as accurate a di&s;qui&s;ition, as the laws of
motion, optics, hydro&s;tatics, or any part of natural
philo&s;ophy.</P>
