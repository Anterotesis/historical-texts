<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE evident Approach of a War
having been &s;poken to, with &s;ome
Approbation; the evident Advantages of
it to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> &s;eem as natural to be
&s;poken to, as they are nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Hand therefore applies it &s;elf
to this Part however officiou&s;ly, yet with
the &s;ame Sincerity, to encourage the Nati|on
in the pro&s;ecuting of the War, when
it &s;hall be begun.</P>
<P>If the many Di&s;appointments which the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> have met with in forming
their De&s;igns, and the dull Pro&s;pects they
have before them in carrying them on, have
not prevail'd on them to take better Mea|&s;ures,
or to act a wi&s;er Part; but that
they will go on, in &s;pight, not of Rea&s;on on|ly,
but even of Nature; that very Ob&s;tina|cy
is an Encouragement to us, who have
&s;o many A&s;&s;urances of Succe&s;s in every
Branch of the War.</P>
<P>But when the Advantages to our Com|merce
come to be weighed al&s;o, and added
<PB REF="4">
to the Advantages of the War, one would
be apt to &s;ay that as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;eem
infatuated in the Beginning it; we &s;hould
all be infatuated, if we did not take hold
of the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Author de&s;ires to capitulate for &s;o
much Favour, (however otherwi&s;e di&s;cou|raged,)
that as this Tract is written with
the &s;ame &s;incere Affection to the publick
Intere&s;t, as well of the Government as of the
whole Nation, as the former, it may be accep|ted
in the &s;ame manner; he earne&s;tly wi&s;hes
that the Advantages to our Commerce, which
&s;o evidently offer on the Occa&s;ion of this
War, may be embrac'd; that our Trade,
which at this Time &s;uffers under many o|ther
Difficulties, may at lea&s;t revive upon
the Follies of our Enemies, and by tho&s;e
very Steps by which they think to ruin it.</P>
<P>He is al&s;o ready at any time to di&s;clo&s;e
&s;ome remaining Advantages of this War, as
they relate to Commerce, which &s;eem yet
not to be noticed by our Superiors, and to
recommend them to Practice, and that with|out
any Pro&s;pect of Intere&s;t, or Hopes of
Reward.</P>

<HI>Advantages</HI> to GREAT BRITAIN, and its
ALLIES, from the <HI>Approaching</HI> WAR.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">That the fir&s;t Scheme of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> De&s;igns might be &s;aid
to have &s;ome Weight in them. That the Di&s;appointments
they have met with ought to have made them de&s;pair, and
give over; but that their ob&s;tinate pur&s;uing tho&s;e broken
Mea&s;ures, notwith&s;tanding their Di&s;appointments, makes
them appear Ridiculous and Ab&s;urd.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT has hitherto been &s;poken of the Certain|ty
and Nece&s;&s;ity of a War, and of its Evident
Approach, has been founded upon the Di&s;|coveries
made by the Enemy them&s;elves, or by
the general Knowledge of Things; as the Publick Affairs of
<HI>Europe</HI> had an evident Tendency in their Con&s;equences to a
Rupture. <HI>What can't be otherwi&s;e, mu&s;t be &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>It is no great Conce&s;&s;ion in this Argument, for an Author
to &s;ay he is no Privy-Coun&s;ellor, no Secret-Service Man;
that he &s;ees only <HI>without Doors,</HI> and judges only from <HI>what
is,</HI> to <HI>what may be.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and even the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI>
(who in this Di&s;cour&s;e, and for this Occa&s;ion in particular,
we call the Enemy) have taken care to act, not as if they de|&s;ign'd
the Thing &s;hould be a Secret, or that they would amu&s;e
the World about it, and that we &s;hould be at an Uncertainty
in the Que&s;tion, whether they de&s;ign'd to make a War of it,
or no; they &s;eem rather to be removing all po&s;&s;ible Doubts a|bout
it from our Thoughts, and making it appear, not that
they really intended it, but that it can be no otherwi&s;e; that
the <HI>Rubicon</HI> was pa&s;t, the Thing determined, and that it could
not be avoided.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="6">
This made the former Di&s;cour&s;e upon this Subject bear
the Title of Evident, <HI>The Evident Approach,</HI> &amp;c. intimating, that
the War was Evident and Vi&s;ible in its Approach, and that
they mu&s;t have &s;ome Defect in their Under&s;tanding, who made
any longer Doubt of it; that the Parties were as they &s;ay of Armies,
in full March to Engage. Indeed, it &s;eems to co&s;t the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
&s;ome Pains to obtain a Belief among Mankind, that they were
in Earne&s;t; for &s;uch Difficulties offered them&s;elves in the
Thing it &s;elf, to the meane&s;t and mo&s;t common Ob&s;ervation,
that it was not ea&s;y to bring People to believe the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
Weak enough to be in Earne&s;t, or that they were really
entering upon a War (and e&s;pecially making them&s;elves Ag|gre&s;&s;ors)
in which they were as certain to be Lo&s;ers, as
as they were to be Parties; as certain to be beaten, as to
fight, and in which indeed it could (by the Nature of Things)
be no otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, I mu&s;t confe&s;s it &s;eemed a nece&s;&s;ary Piece
of Work, to per&s;wade the People to believe the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in|tended
a War, and that therefore That was fir&s;t to be laid
down as a Principle, and rendered as Undeniable as all Princi|ples
in Matters of Di&s;pute ought to be; and how could this
be done better, than by the concurring Te&s;timony of the E|nemy
them&s;elves, either declared in plain Words at length,
or gathered as the Natural Con&s;equences of all their A|ctions?</P>
<P>When
I &s;ay, the Meaning of an Enemy appears from the
natural Con&s;equences of their Actions, I mu&s;t be allowed to
argue thus: When I &s;ee plainly, that a Man re&s;olves to put
&s;uch Hard&s;hips, &s;uch Pieces of Inju&s;tice, and &s;uch Affronts upon
me, as he has good Rea&s;on to know I will not and ought not to
bear, without the mo&s;t Scandalous Reproach to my Character,
the utmo&s;t Damage and Lo&s;s to my Intere&s;t, and the utmo&s;t
Danger and Hazard to my Life; and that therefore he knows
at the &s;ame Time, &s;uch U&s;age of me will force me to re&s;i&s;t
him, and repel Force with Force; when I &s;ee him, I &s;ay, act|ing
in &s;uch a Manner, I may (without Injury to him) con|clude,
That in &s;hort he de&s;igns to Quarrel with me; it is the
natural Con&s;equence of the Thing; the Language of his Be|haviour
&s;peaks it as plain, as if he &s;ent me a Challenge, or de|fy'd
me in Words at length.</P>
<P>Thus in Ca&s;e of the Conduct of the &s;everal Powers we are
now &s;peaking of: When we &s;ee them Leaguing and Confe|derating
together, forming a Strength of Intere&s;ts, entering in|to
Secret Engagements, and tho&s;e Secret Engagements pointed
directly and particularly at the Intere&s;t of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> at
<PB N="3" REF="7">
the Per&s;on, Honour, and Royal Dignity of his Maje&s;ty, as
King of <HI>Great Britain</HI>:</P>
<P>It we &s;ee them concerting Mea&s;ures for the &s;omenting Di|vi&s;ions,
Feuds, and Factions among the People, and rai&s;ing
Rebellion and Civil War in the Heart of his Maje&s;ty's Domi|nions:</P>
<P>If
we &s;ee them breaking all Faith and Honour, Pledg'd and
Engaged in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner, by e&s;pou&s;ing that de&s;picable
Intere&s;t which they had Renounced, and Promi&s;ed effectually
to Abandon and Reject; I mean that of the Pretender, whom
they had mutually engag'd not to A&s;&s;i&s;t or Support in any
manner what&s;oever; and that tho&s;e Engagements were enter|ed
into in &s;uch Terms<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Terms of the mutual Engagement between the two Courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Madrid,</HI> are &s;aid to be expre&s;ly thus: <HI>To Undertake to place the Pretender upon the Throne of</HI> Great Britain.</NOTE> as could not be broken without a
Violation of Honour, in &s;uch a Manner, as few Per&s;ons of
&s;uch Dignity, in the World, could ever &s;atisfie them&s;elves to
be guilty of:</P>
<P>If we &s;ee them, tho' Crowned Heads, tho' Princes, and
Chri&s;tian Princes, &s;tooping &s;o far below the Dignity of Crowned
Heads, as to encourage Trea&s;on and Rebellion, &s;upporting
Subjects in Traiterous De&s;igns again&s;t their Sovereign; which
Sovereign, both the&s;e Crowned Heads had Own'd and Re|ceiv'd
in the Quality of Lawful and Rightful; and had So|lemnly,
and in a particular Manner Engaged, not to di&s;turb
in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;aid Lawful and Rightful Government,
as above:<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The Sixth Article of the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> runs thus: <Q REND="inline">'The Catholick King doth Promi&s;e, as well in his own Name, as in that of his Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors. That they will not at any Time di&s;turb or mole&s;t the QUEEN, her Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Line, being in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the Do|minions Subject thereunto: Neither will the &s;aid Catholick King, or any of his Succe&s;&s;ors, give at any Time any <HI>Aid, Succour, Favour</HI> or <HI>Coun&s;el,</HI> directly, or indirectly, to any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, who on any Cau&s;e or Pretence, &s;hall hereafter endeavour to Oppo&s;e the &s;aid Succe&s;|&s;ion, by Open War, or by any Con&s;piracies, again&s;t &s;uch Prince and Princes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;aid Throne of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as afore&s;aid.'</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>If we &s;ee them Leaguing and Confederating, for the form|ing
Intere&s;ts de&s;tructive to the Commerce of the&s;e Kingdoms;
laying open &s;uch Branches of Trade as by former Leagues and
Conventions were expre&s;ly Limited and Re&s;train'd; Invading
the Commerce, which it was expre&s;ly Stipulated &s;hould not
<PB N="4" REF="8">
be invaded, and breaking in upon the Property of a Nation,
as well as of particular Per&s;ons in the &s;aid Commerce:</P>
<P>If, I &s;ay, the&s;e things are evident, and that we know they
are &s;uch as the Nation of <HI>Great Britain</HI> will not &s;it down
&s;atisfied with, or, as we may ju&s;tly &s;ay, cannot but re&s;ent, and
that with the utmo&s;t Indignation; and that the &s;aid Enemy
mu&s;t know they would be &s;o re&s;ented; we mu&s;t conclude
them likewi&s;e in earne&s;t to quarrel with the People of <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> and to begin a War.</P>
<P>It has not therefore been in&s;ignificant, in Order to convince
the People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> of the &s;tated and &s;ettled Re&s;olu|tions
of the &s;aid <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> to in&s;ult and af|front
his Maje&s;ty, and to bring about a War in <HI>Europe,</HI> for
the carrying tho&s;e De&s;igns and Re&s;olutions on; I &s;ay, it has
not been in&s;ignificant to tho&s;e Ends, that Methods have been
taken to expo&s;e the private, and, as I may call them, Clande|&s;tine
Methods of the &s;aid Confederating Powers, for the en|couraging
Trea&s;on and Rebellion among the King's Subjects,
for animating di&s;affected Parties, and for forming unju&s;tifiable
Schemes of Trade, &s;uch as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily end in War and
Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>To prove that the Enemy re&s;olve to bring the Allies to a
Nece&s;&s;ity of making War in their own Defence, is to prove
that a War will nece&s;&s;arily be the Con&s;equence; and in &s;uch
Ca&s;e, if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> re&s;olve to prompt that Nece&s;&s;ity, 'tis the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> make the War, not the Confederates.</P>
<P>To put things upon us which it is not rea&s;onable we &s;hou'd
bear, which no Nation in their Sen&s;es can bear, and which
they may depend upon his Maje&s;ty will not bear, or his Al|lies
either, is indeed to begin the War, or at lea&s;t to declare
the War to be inevitable.</P>
<P>It was not therefore &s;o remote from the Que&s;tion in hand
to &s;ay we &s;hou'd go to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and to the Empe|ror,
and ask them whether we &s;hall have <HI>War</HI> or <HI>Peace</HI>; it is
for them to an&s;wer that Que&s;tion; and their Actions have in|deed
determin'd it already, they have made the War a thing
not only Certain, but, as I &s;ay, Inevitable; nay they have begun
the War by a &s;ecret clande&s;tine Conduct, full of Machinery,
full of Secret, and yet Evident Acts of Ho&s;tility; and by
carrying on &s;uch Mines and &s;ubterranean Attacks again&s;t the
<HI>Hanover</HI> Allies, as they might ea&s;ily know and be &s;ure tho&s;e
Allies would not bear, and &s;uch as indeed they ought not to
expect wou'd be born with.</P>
<P>In a Word, all the Conduct of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Allies has been
Pacific, Healing, and vi&s;ibly endeavouring to heal and make
<PB N="5" REF="9">
up the Breaches which have appear'd, and to pre&s;erve a good Un|der&s;tanding
between the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI>; on the other hand, all
the Conduct of the Enemy has been menacing, provoking, and
in&s;ulting; Clouds big with Thunder, tho' empty of Force;
<HI>Brutum fulmen</HI>; Noi&s;e without a Bolt; Threats without a
Hand to execute; pointing, but not pointed. In a Word,
They have breathed War on every Occa&s;ion, that if po&s;&s;ible
they might make it nece&s;&s;ary to the Allies to begin it.</P>
<P>It &s;eems they have 'till this time been able to do little more
than Urge and Provoke, u&s;ing all the Methods po&s;&s;ible to
&s;how their ill Will, except that of Force; which tho' they
have been unable to make much u&s;e of, they have &s;hown evi|dently,
that they intend all that is or &s;hall be in their Power, to
injure and offend the <HI>Hanover</HI> Allies, and his <HI>Britannick</HI> Ma|je&s;ty
in particular, that &s;o a War may follow of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Not but that this Con&s;equence may happen much &s;ooner
than they will find for their Advantage, and before they may
be thoroughly ready for it; yet it might be very needful to ask up|on
what particular Foundation they, who are in reality &s;o ill able
to carry it on, &s;eem &s;o very ha&s;ty for bringing it to pa&s;s? Whe|ther
they have not met with &s;ome Di&s;appointments &s;ince they
begun thus to &s;how them&s;elves, and whether tho&s;e Di&s;appoint|ments
ever made any vi&s;ible Alterations in their Schemes, or
no?</P>
<P>That they have met with &s;ome Di&s;appointments, is evident,
and that in &s;everal Articles. Nothing is more certain than that
they had a View of &s;everal things, which in their Embrio appear'd
probable and encouraging, which they have &s;ince found Rea|&s;on
to conclude will not an&s;wer their End, and the Defici|ency
of which renders their De&s;igns far le&s;s promi&s;ing and
hopeful than at fir&s;t. For Example:<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>'Tis evident,</HI> they had Hopes of obtaining &s;ome tolerable
Conditions for the Pre&s;erving the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, that is to
&s;ay, for upholding the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company erected at <HI>O&s;tend</HI>;
by which Commerce, the Imperial Court depended upon it, a
large Revenue would accrue to the Publick, as does by the like
Company to the Governments in <HI>England, Holland</HI> and <HI>France.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>'Tis Evident,</HI> they hoped for a mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance and
Communication between the united Powers of <HI>Vienna</HI> and
<HI>Madrid,</HI> the one a&s;&s;i&s;ting the other with Money, and the other
reciprocally &s;upplying Powerful Bodies of Troops to carry on
an offen&s;ive War. The Imperial Court, I doubt not, depended
upon va&s;t Supplies of Money in Specie; at lea&s;t all the &s;tipu|lated
Sums, which were very great; by which Money the Im|perial
Armies, great and numerous already, wou'd be &s;till made
<PB N="6" REF="10">
greater and more powerful, and the War be carry'd on into the
Dominions of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Allies to great Advantage.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>'Tis Evident,</HI> they hoped to bring off <HI>France</HI> from its At|tachment
to the Intere&s;t of the Allies of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and particu|larly
from its warm Adherence to all &s;uch farther Mea&s;ures
as might embarra&s;s the &s;aid Courts of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Vienna</HI> in a
War with <HI>France</HI>; believing perhaps, that at the wor&s;t, <HI>France</HI>
would not have come into an offen&s;ive Alliance again&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI>
and have turn'd its Arms again&s;t a Branch of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bour|ben</HI>;
in which al&s;o we doubt not they are happily di&s;appointed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. It is evident, <HI>Spain</HI> is particularly under a mo&s;t mortify|ing
Di&s;appointment, in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Squadron blocking up their
Plate-Fleet at <HI>Porto-Belo,</HI> and &s;topping the Returns of tho&s;e im|men&s;e
Sums of Money which &s;hould have been brought to
<HI>Europe</HI> by the Galeons and the <HI>Flota</HI>; which had they come &s;afe,
had (as they tell us) brought them at one time forty Millions
of Pieces of Eight in Specie, which, with the Merchandizes load|ed
on board tho&s;e Ships at the &s;ame time, amounted to above
Ten Millions Sterling; which immen&s;e Sum, tho' much
the greater Part of it was the Property of their own Subjects,
and of the Subjects of the Allies, as Merchants; yet perhaps
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> might have thought fit, at &s;uch a Jun|cture
as that of a War, to have borrowed &s;ome of, or
otherwi&s;e to have appropriated it to the publick U&s;es, for the
maintaining the Engagements mentioned above; perhaps how|ever
making Satisfaction to the Proprietors by &s;ome other way&punc;</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I may name &s;everal other Heads of Di&s;appointment in the
fir&s;t Views which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had of the&s;e things, in their Or|der,
and which had they fore&s;een, they would perhaps have
acted &s;omething more warily than they have done, and &s;o
have given le&s;s Umbrage to the Allies, or at lea&s;t &s;topp'd
their Hands, 'till they had gotten the Money, upon which all
the Re&s;t &s;o much depended, into their Hands.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t note as I go, that here they have been over&s;hot in
their own Bow: Here the Allies have been too old for them:
And now it &s;eems they are going on without their Crutches,
walking without their Legs, and in a word, making the War
without the Money. I return to the Di&s;appointments.</P>
<P>It is evident, be&s;ides all this, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> met with a
very great Di&s;appointment in the <HI>Baltick,</HI> where we are pretty
well a&s;&s;ured they promi&s;ed them&s;elves great A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and
from whence we are told they expected a Supply of Naval
Strength; which Supply they found as effectually lock'd up
in the Port of <HI>Revel,</HI> as they did the Money (that was to pay
for it) in the Haven of <HI>Porto-Belo.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="11">
The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> could no more part with their Ships, or
cau&s;e a Squadron of Men of War to &s;ail without Money,
than the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> could cau&s;e their Armies to march with|out
the &s;ame Supply; and if they (the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) expected it o|therwi&s;e,
if they expected fifteen Sail of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Men of
War would come to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance without Money, they
were much mi&s;taken, and acted more like F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s than the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> generally u&s;ed to do.</P>
<P>Nor is it le&s;s wonderful to me, that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who
u&s;ed to act in former Days with &s;uch con&s;ummate Wi&s;dom,
and by &s;uch impenetrable Councils, that it was &s;aid of <HI>Don
Lewis de Haro,</HI> he obey'd the Scripture in his Politicks, what|ever
he did in his Alms, and that he did not <HI>let his right Hand
know</HI> what <HI>his left Hand did</HI>; that the&s;e very wary circum|&s;pect
<HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;hould let &s;o much of their &s;ecret Service
come to light, and act in &s;uch an unwary and impolitick
Manner, as to have their Mea&s;ures be talk'd publickly of, in
the ordinary Conver&s;ation at <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> as I have been
inform'd has been the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Nothing can excu&s;e the Folly of it, in my Opinion, unle&s;s
I &s;hall with &s;ome People &s;ugge&s;t, that the Improbability of
their Schemes and Chimeras being Succe&s;sful, &s;hould argue
they were not at all in earne&s;t about them: But this has &s;o
much of the <HI>Jacobite</HI> in it, and &s;o little of the Politician, that I
think 'tis &s;carce worth repeating; 'tis much more certain, that the
locking up the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Fleet was an inexpre&s;&s;ible Di&s;ap|pointment
to the <HI>Spaniards</HI>; and that it could not have been,
if their Expectations of Help from that <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Fleet had not
been very great.</P>
<P>It is true, under all the&s;e Di&s;appointments, and more which I
&s;hall &s;peak of pre&s;ently, it might have been expected the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
and the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI> notwith&s;tanding their Confederacy, &s;hould
have laid a&s;ide the De&s;ign it &s;elf, and &s;hould have carried on
the Project no farther; and indeed, this gave Occa&s;ion to my
calling the De&s;ign in general ab&s;urd and ridiculous, &s;uppo&s;ing
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could not be &s;o weak as to go on with it, and that
if they were in Earne&s;t before, they could not be &s;o now.</P>
<P>But &s;ince it is &s;o, that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts,</HI>
think them&s;elves &s;till able to carry on their De&s;igns, and that
they are not &s;ufficiently di&s;courag'd by their Di&s;appointments,
let us then turn the Tables as they do, and talk &s;eriou&s;ly of
it as a thing really intended. And here, as I &s;aid before, tho' the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> are not &s;o Con&s;iderable as to fright us, I hope we
may allow that they are not &s;o Incon&s;iderable as not to awaken
<PB N="8" REF="12">
us. They are certainly &s;trong enough to ju&s;tifie our Prepa|rations,
tho' not &s;o &s;trong as to fill us with Apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>Hence all the Precautions which have been made u&s;e of by
our Government, and by his Maje&s;ty's particular Direction,
have been not ju&s;tified only, but are to be e&s;teem'd as Effects
of the mo&s;t wi&s;e and &s;ucce&s;sful Councils imaginable; a Pru|dence
that has had &s;omething more than common in it, and
which has been the Foundation of all tho&s;e (happy) Di&s;appoint|ments
to the Enemy: <HI>Happy Di&s;appointments</HI> I &s;ay to us, Un|happy
enough to them, and which at this time may be &s;aid to
compleat the Hi&s;tory of the Conduct and Succe&s;s of the <HI>Vi|enna
Alliance.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Precautions and Provi&s;ions, at the &s;ame time that they
have di&s;appointed the Executions of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> De&s;ign, have
al&s;o made the carrying it on farther, ab&s;urd and fooli&s;h; have
really turn'd the Tables upon the Enemy, and made their too-well-concerted
Schemes become ridiculous; the Mea&s;ures
which, as fir&s;t propo&s;ed among them&s;elves, appear'd rational
and probable, agreeable to a wi&s;e and prudent Nation, and
to the Coun&s;el of able State&s;men and Mini&s;ters, are by
the&s;e Means become &s;candalou&s;ly vain and imprudent; and
we may ble&s;s the Precaution, I &s;ay, at the &s;ame time that we
make a Je&s;t of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Ob&s;tinacy, in carrying on the&s;e
De&s;igns, after they were &s;o render'd ridiculous.</P>
<P>To ju&s;tifie this Argument, let us return to the fir&s;t Scheme;
let us examine the fir&s;t Pro&s;pects upon which they were form'd,
the Foundation upon which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the Hou&s;e of
<HI>Au&s;tria</HI> united, and upon which the Treaty of <HI>Vienna</HI> was
made; and in doing this, we &s;hall not perhaps find the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
&s;uch weak People as they &s;eem to be now: We &s;hall
find, that 'tis rather their ob&s;tinate per&s;i&s;ting in their Pur&s;uit of
a bla&s;ted Undertaking that renders them ridiculous, than any
Ab&s;urdity or incongruous Acting in the fir&s;t Scheme, or in
the Foundation tho&s;e Schemes were built upon.</P>
<P>Had the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (clo&s;e in their Councils, and pru|dent
in their Conduct) kept their Affairs within the Com|pa&s;s
of their own Cabinet, as they formerly u&s;ed to do, and
&s;ecured the Secret in their own Brea&s;ts; Had they been &s;o far
the Ma&s;ters of their own Schemes, as to have &s;ecur'd the Sup|ports
and Supplies they wanted, &s;o that they could neither
have been kept from a Squadron by blocking up <HI>Revel,</HI> or
from the Galeons by blocking up <HI>Porto-Belo</HI>;</P>
<P>Had they fir&s;t receiv'd the Support of fifteen Men of War,
which is &s;aid to be the Number they expected from the <HI>Cza|rina,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="13">
and the Supply of forty Millions of Pieces of Eight
from <HI>Porto-Belo</HI>; had they brought in the King of <HI>Sardinia,</HI>
and the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the
King of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;everal other Princes and Powers into
the <HI>Vienna</HI> Treaty, as I make no doubt they at fir&s;t ex|pected,
and as they indeed at fir&s;t reported;</P>
<P>Had they brought his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, and the <HI>States-General</HI>
to a Neutrality, as they &s;ay they have obtain'd of the
King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and as I doubt
not they earne&s;tly endeavour'd with the two fir&s;t:</P>
<P>In a word, had all the&s;e Points been gain'd, and had they
met with none of the other Di&s;appointments already men|tion'd,
I mo&s;t readily grant they had form'd a Body of Power
truly terrible and formidable to the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t; and
we had had more Rea&s;on (much more Rea&s;on) to be alarm'd,
and indeed frighted with the Apprehen&s;ions of what might
have been the Con&s;equence of the&s;e things, than I hope we
have had yet, or are like to have now.</P>
<P>Not but even with all tho&s;e I &s;hould &s;till &s;ay, and hope it
would appear, that the Naval Strength of <HI>Great Britain</HI>
might, under Providence, have been our Protection again&s;t
them all.</P>
<P>But they have been di&s;appointed in almo&s;t every Part. Even
the <HI>Venetians</HI> them&s;elves, tho' a State under infinite Obliga|tions
to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and to the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI>
ever &s;ince the Battel of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> yet &s;o ill have they ma|nag'd,
that we do not find they have been able to bring that
wi&s;e People to e&s;pou&s;e their Cau&s;e, or &s;o much as to pro|mi&s;e
a Neutrality, or to act as Auxiliars, by Land or by
Sea.</P>
<P>This Con&s;ideration however may &s;erve to give us the u&s;e|ful
Reflection mention'd above; (<HI>viz.</HI>) How Ju&s;t have been the
Cautions, and how Prudent have been the Mea&s;ures taken on
this Side, (be it by who you will) to dive into the&s;e Secrets,
to detect the&s;e Contrivances! and, which is &s;till more, how
Succe&s;sful, happily Succe&s;sful the Di&s;covery! How many
Ways has it been advantageous, and particularly how u&s;eful,
in having given time for the Preparations of the <HI>Hanover</HI>
Allies; nay, for the forming the Treaty it &s;elf; and in having
opened the Eyes of other Powers, and bringing Them into
it, who &s;eem'd doubtful whether they &s;hould accede or no!</P>
<P>Again; Of what U&s;e has the preventing tho&s;e things been
to us! that from &s;uch a formidable Appearance, from &s;uch a
deep-laid De&s;ign, that was capable of being made thus ter|rible,
they &s;hould be brought to &s;o de&s;picable, and truly con|contemptible
<PB N="10" REF="14">
a Figure, that 'tis hardly rea&s;onable to talk of
them at the &s;ame Time, or hardly think of them in the &s;ame
Cla&s;s, or under the &s;ame Rank.</P>
<P>Had not his Maje&s;ty's penetrating Councils evidently
reach'd to the Bottom of all their De&s;igns, gotten the Know|ledge
of their Schemes, and div'd into the Depth of all their
mo&s;t con&s;iderable Projects, None of all the&s;e preventive Mea|&s;ures
had been taken, none of the&s;e preventive Medicines had
been made u&s;e of; the &s;everal mi&s;chievous Things which they
had concluded on, had not been calmly countermin'd and
unhing'd, or the Contrivers of them been &s;o effectually de|tected
and di&s;appointed, as now they are.</P>
<P>I am far therefore from &s;aying, or &s;ugge&s;ting, that the De|&s;igns
and Schemes of tho&s;e Powers had not been capable of
great Attempts; that the Naval Power of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>
join'd, might not have been &s;ufficient to have brought the Preten|der
upon the Stage in &s;ome Part or other, or at lea&s;t to have given
him &s;ome Expectations, and have put him, and his ea&s;ily deluded
Party, in hopes of great things to be done for him that Way:
Or that the numerous Armies of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> and the King
of <HI>Spain,</HI> united, with &s;uch Allies too as are mentioned, might
not have been able to have given us great Unea&s;ine&s;s, and to
have even endanger'd the Safety of all the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;ts of
<HI>Europe,</HI> as well as of the&s;e united Kingdoms of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>As then I grant the Danger to have been <HI>thus Great,</HI> had they
gone on uninterrupted; I mu&s;t allow al&s;o, that the Di&s;covery
having been thus happy, it behoves us to keep the Hold that
is gain'd, to pre&s;erve the Advantages of the Di&s;covery, to
keep the &s;eparated Powers in the &s;ame &s;tate of Separation; to
keep up the engag'd Powers to their Engagements, and by all
lawful means to pre&s;erve the Con&s;ederacy of the &s;everal Na|tions
that are thus confederated; to cultivate the Union that
they are now brought to, and if po&s;&s;ible to encrea&s;e it; This I
think is the only way to pre&s;erve our Religion and Liberties,
our Superiority of Power, and al&s;o our Commerce, in the
Condition it &s;tands in at this Time.</P>
<P>Heav'ns be prais'd! the Snare is laid open; the Enchant|ment
is broken; the Plot for the cementing the Powers pro|po&s;ed
is di&s;covered: No Application can be too Great, no
Charge or Expence ought to be &s;par'd to keep it where it is:
and therefore all that his Maje&s;ty has recommended to the
Two Hou&s;es of Parliament, for their engaging them&s;elves
vigorou&s;ly in their own Defence, is of &s;ufficient Weight
on that Side: Nor can any one object that the utmo&s;t
Application ought not to be u&s;ed, to render all tho&s;e At|tempts
<PB N="11" REF="15">
as Abortive, as I think they are now become Ridi|culous.</P>
<P>To
do this, the proper Steps are taken indeed; the Money is
lock'd up, and the Ships are lock'd in; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are
di&s;appointed, and nothing remains but &s;o to double and redou|ble
the &s;ame Efforts, as to make tho&s;e Lockings-up more ef|fectual,
and to take from the King of <HI>Spain</HI> all Hopes of
removing tho&s;e Ob&s;tructions.</P>
<P>I am told, while the&s;e Sheets were writing, that I write too
much with an Air of Contempt, when I mention the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Affairs; as if a Squadron of Ships at <HI>Porto-Belo</HI> could effectu|ally
&s;top the whole Channel of Silver, and that not a Ship could
e&s;cape us, that nothing could pa&s;s from <HI>America</HI> to old <HI>Spain</HI>
without our Leave; and that we are as &s;ure of intercepting
all the Ships that &s;hall &s;tir out, as if we had them in Tow.</P>
<P>But the Objector is mi&s;taken: I no where &s;ugge&s;t that the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hall be able to bring no Money home, that we
&s;hall &s;top it all, &s;o that nothing &s;hall go by us: But I may ven|ture
to &s;ay, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Squadrons, if well po&s;ted, and if the
Commanders do their Duty, will &s;o narrowly watch the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
that they mu&s;t run great Hazards, if they attempt to
come away with any great Quantity; and that &s;uch Hazards,
as I am per&s;waded the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will not think fit to venture
their Trea&s;ure upon it.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may not be po&s;&s;ible &s;o effectually to &s;hut up
all the Ports which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI>
or &s;o effectually to ply <HI>off</HI> and <HI>on</HI> upon all the Coa&s;t of
Old <HI>Spain,</HI> as that no Ship, not one Ship, &s;hall be able to &s;lip
out on the one hand, or find its way in on the other, without
falling into our Hands, or into &s;ome of the Hands of tho&s;e that
would be willing to &s;nap and lay hold on them; and I could
fruitfully employ &s;ome Pages here to &s;how how and which
way &s;uch things might probably be done, and might more
probably be prevented.</P>
<P>But as, in the fir&s;t place, our Governors do not &s;eem to
want Directions for the preventing it; &s;o, on the other hand,
I am not <HI>Spaniards</HI> enough to &s;how the Enemy, if they &s;tood
in more need of it than they do, how to defeat the Mea&s;ures
taken by <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to meet with and &s;urpri&s;e them.</P>
<P>But to go on. I may grant, that it is not probable the
Confederate Fleets or Squadrons, however Vigilant, or how
diligently &s;oever they may guard the Coa&s;t, and &s;pread the
Seas, either on one &s;ide or the other, &s;hould ever be able to &s;ur|pri&s;e
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;o effectually, that not one Ship &s;hould be
able to come &s;afe in.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="16">
The Sea is a wide Place, and it mu&s;t be very well &s;pread
to &s;ecure every Ship, and lie upon every Point of the Com|pa&s;s,
&s;o that nothing &s;hould be able to go by: We &s;ee here
that notwith&s;tanding Admiral <HI>Ho&s;ier</HI>'s Squadron on the Coa&s;t
of the <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> and notwith&s;tanding Admiral <HI>Hop&s;on</HI> is crui|&s;ing
off of the Southward <HI>Cape</HI>; yet Fame tells us, that three
or four Ships have found their way into the Ports of <HI>Spain</HI>;
and coming by &s;uch different Cour&s;es as they have done, it is
not at all &s;trange that they &s;hould: It is true, we are told they
bring no Silver, at lea&s;t, none that we know of; and had
they been all deeply loaden with Silver, it might have been
the &s;ame thing, and no Body to blame neither.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we mu&s;t have exceeding bad Luck in|deed,
and &s;uch as we have no rea&s;on to expect, con&s;idering
the Numbers of our Ships, and the Vigilance and expert Know|ledge
of our Seamen, if they &s;hou'd go all &s;afe, and none of
them &s;hou'd fall into our Hands; in which Ca&s;e I mu&s;t add,
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Trea&s;ure comes in &s;uch good round Lumps,
and &s;uch merry Sums together, that if it &s;hou'd be but <HI>now
and then</HI> that a Galeon &s;hou'd fall into our Hands, it would
make the Fortune of the War go &s;milingly forward on our
Side; a few &s;uch Prizes might make good a Summer's Ser|vice,
and help the Government to carry on the War.</P>
<P>How often do we find the Loading of but one Ship amount
to four, five or &s;ix Millions of Pieces of Eight; and if we
&s;hou'd chance to make &s;uch a Ship or two find their way up
to <HI>Woolwich</HI> in a Year, or to' deliver her Loading at <HI>Tower|wharf,</HI>
it would go a great way towards carrying on the War,
and would be a much better way of rai&s;ing Money, than four
Shillings in the Pound upon Land.</P>
<P>This very Con&s;ideration will no doubt exceedingly weigh
with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in that particular Ca&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> as to venturing
out with their Silver; I mean not the Lo&s;s only to them&s;elves,
tho' that would be very con&s;iderable; (and the Di&s;courage|ment
and Damage to them in ca&s;e of &s;uch a Lo&s;s, is not ea&s;ily
de&s;crib'd:) But the Encouragement it wou'd be to their Ene|mies.
The Lo&s;s to them&s;elves would be inexpre&s;&s;ibly great;
e&s;pecially as they have no other Source of Wealth, no other
Fund of Trea&s;ure; all the Produce of their own Dominions
is able to do little for them, compar'd to this; and if either the
Galeons are kept entirely back, or &s;hou'd mi&s;carry in coming
forward, and fall into the Hands of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Allies, we
may, without affronting the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> &s;ay they will be but in
a &s;orry Condition to carry on the War, and to &s;upport their
new-bought Friends.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="17">
But that is not all: The Triumph of their Enemies over them,
&s;hou'd the Money fall into the Hands of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Allies,
would be infinitely a greater Mortification to <HI>Spain,</HI> as well
to their Pride as their Power, than the Lo&s;s of the Money;
for this wou'd be enabling the &s;aid Allies to carry on a War
again&s;t <HI>Spain</HI> at the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Expence; and this I make no que&s;ti|on
they &s;hall do, though they &s;hou'd not take the Trea&s;ure at
Sea at all. But of that by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mean time we need not fear but we &s;hall catch &s;ome
by the way, though it may not come all to Hand: As I &s;aid
above, we mu&s;t have very bad Luck indeed if none of their
Ships fall in our way; and if any are taken, they are general|ly
worth bringing home.</P>
<P>The Probability of this is one of the Rea&s;ons on which it
has been &s;o openly &s;aid, that <HI>England</HI> may Gain by a War
with <HI>France,</HI> but never Lo&s;es by a War with <HI>Spain</HI>; of which
we &s;hall have room to &s;ay more from a particular Enquiry into
our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, where (unle&s;s upon taking a <HI>Spani&s;h
Flota,</HI> a <HI>Vigo</HI> Account &s;hou'd be given of it, (<HI>viz.</HI>) where
much &s;hou'd be lo&s;t, and but little gain'd,) we might find large
Sums have been brought into <HI>England,</HI> taken from the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
on all Occa&s;ions of a War; as particularly at the ta|king
of <HI>Cadiz</HI> by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> when it was &s;aid
that be&s;ides the publick Gain upon redeeming the City,
and other Articles; all the Officers and Soldiers got not e|nough
only, but enough to make them rich. But of this a|gain
in its Place.</P>
<P>In the mean time, though the Prizes we might take &s;hould
be but few, yet 'tis not unlikely we may have &s;ome Share of
Booty in &s;uch a War, as well private as publick; &s;uch as may
amount to another Di&s;appointment to <HI>Spain,</HI> and that, &s;uch a
Di&s;appointment as <HI>Spain</HI> will not ea&s;ily recover, and of which
they may have time enough to repent. And this brings me mo&s;t
naturally to the chief De&s;ign of this Work, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Ad|vantages
<HI>Spain</HI> is likely to make of this War which they are
&s;o forward to engage in: or, to &s;peak plain, the Advantages
the <HI>Hanover</HI> Allies are likely to make of it. In our Enquiry
after which, it may be determin'd by the mo&s;t ordinary Judg|ment,
whether I have pa&s;s'd a wrong Cen&s;ure in &s;aying that
the Conduct of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> is ab&s;urd and ridiculous, or no.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Advantages which offer by this War to the
<HI>Hanover</HI> Allies, and to <HI>Great Britain</HI> in particular,
as they relate to the Trade of the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Nece&s;&s;ity of a War has been &s;poken to. The Con|duct
of our Enemies, however ridiculous, as well as the
Conduct of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> however deliberate, concur to
make that Nece&s;&s;ity evident. <HI>Let the</HI> Spaniards <HI>go on,</HI> (as the

<HI>God &s;end them a good Deliverance.</HI></P>
<P>How backward have the <HI>Hanover</HI> Allies been to quarrel?
How have they been &s;o far from &s;eeking Occa&s;ions, that
they have even refus'd to take Occa&s;ion when offer'd?</P>
<P>How reluctant have the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court been in drawing
the Sword? how willing to prevent the feeble Enemy from
blu&s;t'ring with theirs?</P>
<P>What Pacific Mea&s;ures have they all along pur&s;u'd? what
Opportunities of offending have they pa&s;s'd over? nay, what
needful Defendings have they &s;eem'd to omit? Let us &s;ee a
little into the Nature of all the&s;e things.</P>
<P>Whether has the Backwardne&s;s of the Allies to a War been
occa&s;ion'd by their Fear of the formidable Power of the Ene|my?
or, Has it been from a full Per&s;ua&s;ion that the Enemy
having no Advantages in view from the War could not be
in earne&s;t, in all or in any thing they have &s;aid or done about
it, <HI>or at lea&s;t would remain &s;o but a very little while</HI>?</P>
<P>As nothing they have &s;aid about War has been rational,
&s;o nothing they have done towards a War hitherto &s;eems to
have been founded in Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>No Man fights meerly becau&s;e he Hates, but becau&s;e he
Hopes. Defen&s;ive War is entred into by Force and Nece&s;&s;ity,
but it is too with Hopes of being able to defend, able to re|pell
the Force they fear.</P>
<P>But Offen&s;ive War is founded on a firm Belief of Victory
and Hope of Conque&s;t; it can &s;tand upon no other Bottom;
and therefore in old Times, entring into War was u&s;ually call'd
an Act <HI>of Faith,</HI> rather than <HI>of Hope,</HI> being an Opinion, nay a
Confidence, of Succe&s;s; either tru&s;ting <HI>in Heaven</HI> for it from
the Ju&s;tice of the Cau&s;e, or in them&s;elves from the Strength
of their Arms.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="19">
But here's a War to be undertaken, with neither Faith in
Heaven, or Hope on Earth: Neither a View of Defending,
or Hope of Offending. How the Heroes of <HI>Spain</HI> will come
off with the Credit of their Under&s;tanding, That we &s;ee no|thing
of; <HI>Time mu&s;t di&s;cover it.</HI></P>
<P>Since then we cannot &s;ee any Gain the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can make
of the War, nor any Lo&s;s we can &s;u&s;tain by it; let us &s;ee
what are like to be the Con&s;equences of it, one way or other.
1. If the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are not like to Gain, let us enquire, What
they are like to Lo&s;e by it; for War is a Game in which the
Parties &s;eldom draw Stakes, they generally gain much, or
lo&s;e much. 2. Since the Allies cannot (with any manner of
Rea&s;on) apprehend much Lo&s;s by the War, let us &s;ee what
Gain may be made by it <HI>on their Side.</HI></P>
<P>The Learned in Politicks have an ancient Way of Talk|ing
(as old as Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>) about <HI>England</HI>'s making War,
which (with a little Amendment) reads thus: ENGLAND
<HI>may Gain by a War with</HI> France, <HI>but never Lo&s;es by a War with</HI>
SPAIN.</P>
<P>'Tis my &s;tated Opinion (&s;peaking without National Preju|dice)
that <HI>England</HI> is &s;o far from being in Danger by a War
with <HI>Spain,</HI> that it would be no Lo&s;s to us if we never had
any Peace with them; and I believe we have much more to &s;ay
for a continued War with <HI>Spain,</HI> than the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have for
a continued War with the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis plain (as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves &s;ay) they have car|ried
on the War in <HI>Africk,</HI> the&s;e Eighty Years pa&s;t, without
Fighting, and a Commerce the&s;e Hundred Years, without Tra|ding.
The <HI>Moors</HI> have indeed be&s;ieged <HI>Ceuta</HI> (after their way)
for above Forty Years; but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ay, that by the
Commi&s;&s;ary's Account of Ammunition, the Garri&s;on of <HI>Ca|diz</HI>
have &s;pent more Powder at the Puntals there in Salutes,
than the Garri&s;on of <HI>Ceuta</HI> have &s;pent in Defending them&s;elves,
during all the Siege; the late particular Expedition of the Mar|quis
<HI>de Lede</HI> excepted, which was but &s;hort.</P>
<P>This Re&s;olution of <HI>Spain,</HI> never to enter into any Treaty
with the <HI>Moors,</HI> has been derived from one or both of the&s;e
two following &s;imple Cau&s;es: 1. A religious, rigid Separation,
and fiery Zeal again&s;t <HI>Pagani&s;m,</HI> and again&s;t <HI>Mahomet</HI>; re|&s;olving
that the true Catholick Church &s;hould have no Com|merce,
no Peace, no Communication with the Enemies of
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; the &s;ame futious Zeal which they have likewi&s;e car|ried
on again&s;t the <HI>Jews.</HI> Or, 2. and which I take to be the
truer and more rational Account of it, A haughty In&s;olence,
founded on the cruel Animo&s;ity of that War, which for &s;o
<PB N="16" REF="20">
many Years was carried on again&s;t the <HI>Moors</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> 'till
their utter Extirpation; in which War they gave no Quarter,
took no Pri&s;oners, not would admit even the Remains of
tho&s;e People (tho' willing to become their Subjects) &s;o much
as to live among them.</P>
<P>Unhappy Pride! How many Nations, as well as private
People, has it &s;truck blind, and cover'd their Eyes from their
own Felicities? The <HI>Spaniards</HI> could carry on no Trade in
the World more to their own Advantage, than that with the
<HI>Moors of Africa,</HI> and yet they won't trade with them, either
from a Civil Pride, that they will only make Slaves of them,
or from a Religious Pride, that they will not conver&s;e with
Infidels.</P>
<P>Trade knows no Religions, no Sects, no Parties, no Divi|&s;ions.
We may ('tis hoped) be as zealous to hate God's Ene|mies,
as the <HI>Spaniards</HI>; and yet we trade with the <HI>Turks,</HI>
<HI>Jews, Mahometans, Moors,</HI> or Pagan <HI>Negroes</HI>; and deal with
the Idolaters of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Malabar,</HI> as well as with the Na|tive
Savages and <HI>Cannibals</HI> of <HI>Virginia</HI> and the <HI>Carribees.</HI></P>
<P>There's no Idolatry in Commerce; if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> re|ject
the gainful Trade of <HI>Africa,</HI> on Pretence of Sanctity and
Religion, Is that a Religious Separation? I &s;ay, No: 'Tis not
becau&s;e they are Wi&s;er or Better, but becau&s;e they are <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
that is to &s;ay, eaten up with Pride, Self-Opinion and Haughti|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>That
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> might trade with the <HI>Moors</HI> to great
Advantage, is evident, in that the little Trade they have to
<HI>Africa</HI> (and which they may be &s;aid to have with the Place,
not with the People) is very much to their Gain, and would
be much more &s;o, if they extended it as they might do. But
they trade with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Merchants re&s;iding in
<HI>Africa,</HI> not with the <HI>Moors</HI>; and rather buy the Goods they
demand there, at &s;econd and third Hand, than take them di|rectly
of the <HI>Moors</HI>; &s;o they give away their Profit of the
Trade to the <HI>European</HI> Nations, to gratify the Aver&s;ion they
have to the People.</P>
<P>It is an undoubted Maxim in Trade, <HI>That we ought to Trade
with every Nation, and with every People that we can get Mo|ney
by.</HI> This the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are &s;o far from pur&s;uing, that they
will not deal with the <HI>Moors,</HI> even for the Things which in
Commerce they may be &s;aid to be in Di&s;tre&s;s for, only becau&s;e
they won't deal with them.</P>
<P>In the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are &s;ometimes
in for want of Corn, how do they chu&s;e to &s;end to <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
to <HI>Holland,</HI> to the <HI>Levant,</HI> or indeed any where for Corn,
<PB N="17" REF="21">
rather than to <HI>Africa,</HI> rather than deal with the <HI>Barbarians,</HI>
tho' the <HI>Barbary</HI> Coa&s;t &s;ometimes has a great Plenty, and
tho' they give two Dollars <HI>per</HI> Bu&s;hel for the Corn, which
they could buy there for <HI>3s.</HI> or thereabouts, and &s;ometimes
for much le&s;s.</P>
<P>In their rejecting now the Manufactures of <HI>Europe,</HI> how
ea&s;y would it be to &s;upply them&s;elves with a Quantity of
Wool from <HI>Barbary,</HI> which, with a &s;mall Application, would
mix and work up with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wool, and make all the
&s;everal Manufactures of <HI>England</HI> to Perfection, and to the in|finite
Advantage of <HI>Spain</HI> it &s;elf: But, for&s;ooth, they mu&s;t
not Buy or Sell with the <HI>Mahometans</HI> and Enemies of Chri&s;t;
tho' Him&s;elf gave them a quite different Example, accepting
of a Draught of cold Water from the <HI>Samaritan,</HI> with whom
the <HI>Jews</HI> (<HI>Spaniard-like</HI>) had no Dealings.</P>
<P>But (contrary to the Beneficent, Humble, and Gracious Ex|ample
of Chri&s;t him&s;elf) the proud <HI>Spaniards</HI> (pretending Re|ligion)
throw away their Commerce, &s;corn the Ble&s;&s;ings of
an advantageous Trade, and rather maintain a con&s;tant unre|conciled
National Feud, a fooli&s;h, faint, and unactive War;
refu&s;ing to trade with the <HI>Moors,</HI> and carrying on neither
Peace or War.</P>
<P>As this Ca&s;e &s;tands with <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Barbary</HI> Shore, the
Former is infinitely to blame, and may be &s;aid to act ridiculou&s;ly,
becau&s;e, as above (&s;peaking in the Language of Merchants) e|very
Body &s;hould be Traded with that you can gain by. No
Nation willingly interrupt their own Commerce, or refu&s;e to
let their Subjects trade with &s;uch other Nations as they can
gain by. For a Trading Nation to Prohibit the Importation
of &s;uch Goods as they want, is like Prohibiting the bringing in
Corn in a Famine, or Prohibiting Arms and Ammunition
in a War. When the War was hotte&s;t between <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King prohibited almo&s;t all the re&s;t of
our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods, forbidding, upon the &s;evere&s;t Penalties,
the bringing any of tho&s;e Goods into any Part of his Domi|nions,
it was ob&s;ervable however that they always excepted
<HI>Wool, Leather,</HI> and <HI>Lead</HI>; the&s;e were never Prohibited; the
Rea&s;on was plain, they had none, or but very little of their
own, and very much wanted them all; nor could they be &s;up|plyed
(at lea&s;t not &s;ufficiently) from any other Place.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Spaniards</HI> act by none of the&s;e Prudentials, for
they refu&s;e to Trade with the <HI>Moors,</HI> or Merchants of <HI>Africa,</HI>
though they might gain very con&s;iderably by it. The <HI>Africans</HI>
have Corn, Copper, Wax, Wool, all which the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
extremely want, and yet will not buy, becau&s;e (for&s;ooth) they
<PB N="18" REF="22">
don't like the <HI>Moors</HI> wor&s;hipping <HI>Mahomet</HI>; as if Religion
had any thing to do with Commerce, and as if the Bread
made of <HI>African</HI> Corn, would infect their People with Ido|latry.</P>
<P>Now
I alledge, and in&s;i&s;t upon it, That in a con&s;tant
State of War between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> the Ca&s;e would
be quite otherwi&s;e, for here would be War without Prohibi|tion;
as in their Management with the <HI>Moors,</HI> they have Pro|hibition
without War. I explain my &s;elf thus:</P>
<P>As we Trade with <HI>Spain,</HI> the State of Things lies &s;o much
to the Advantage of <HI>Spain,</HI> that tho' the mo&s;t violent War
that it is po&s;&s;ible to imagine was to be carried on between
the Nations, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (that is to &s;ay, the Merchants)
would endeavour with the utmo&s;t Art to carry on the
Trade, notwith&s;tanding the &s;tricte&s;t Prohibitions: The Rea&s;on
is plain;</P>
<P>They would Trade, becau&s;e they gain by the Trade; the
Trade to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> takes off the Growth and Produce,
which they are ruin'd if they do not Sell, and &s;upplies them
with Nece&s;&s;aries which they are ruin'd if they cannot Buy:
In a word, they have no Commerce without us; their whole
Export is &s;tagnated; their Fruits (their Wines, and their Oyl)
would rot upon the Trees, and not be worth gathering; their
Lands lye uncultivated, and no Hands be employ'd; the Poor
would &s;tarve, and the Rich be beggar'd and undone: In &s;hort,
we buy nothing of <HI>Spain,</HI> but what we can very well be with|out,
and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> take nothing of us, but what they ex|tremely
want.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, take the Alternative in the Commerce;
what the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> buy in <HI>Spain,</HI> as it is the Growth and Pro|duce
of the Country, 'tis e&s;&s;ential to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to have
tho&s;e Goods taken off their Hands, and by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> too in
particular; the Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> do not take
them off, no other Nation can do it. <HI>For Example</HI>:</P>
<P>The Growth and Product of <HI>Spain</HI> con&s;i&s;ts (&s;o far as it re|gards
Trade) of Wines, that is to &s;ay, <HI>Sherry, Alicant, Tent,</HI>
<HI>Mountain-Malaga</HI>; <HI>Galitia</HI> and <HI>Viana</HI> Reds; <HI>Barcelona</HI> and
<HI>Bene Carlo</HI> Reds, and <HI>Canary</HI> Whites; <HI>Barcelonian</HI> Brandy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
al&s;o Fruits, &s;uch as <HI>Malaga</HI> and <HI>Alicant</HI> Rai&s;ins, Oranges,
Limons, Almonds: be&s;ides <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wool, <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Iron, and
la&s;tly, Oil and Soap.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things being the Growth of <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> buy
in very great Quantities; if they are not bought off, <HI>Spain,</HI> as
to the Trade of it, is ruin'd and undone: whereas if <HI>England</HI>
bought none of tho&s;e Goods from <HI>Spain,</HI> they could either
<PB N="19" REF="23">
do without them (for neither Wine, or Brandy, or Rai&s;ins,
or Oranges, or Lemons, are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to Life, or to Trade,
as that we cannot, as to the mo&s;t of them, live without them)
or as to Trade, have them &s;omewhere el&s;e.</P>
<P>So that upon the whole, there is no ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity on
our Side, to have the Growth of <HI>Spain</HI>; but there is a Nece&s;&s;i|ty
on the Side of <HI>Spain</HI> to be Traded with, &s;o as to have their
Goods taken off.</P>
<P>It is true, the taking off the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufacture by the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
is very much the Advantage of <HI>Great Britain</HI>; but all
that is Advantageous is not Nece&s;&s;ary: We are able to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t
in Trade, without the Profits of our Manufactures, bet|ter
than the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Life, without the
U&s;e of them. Nor is that all; for let the King of <HI>Spain</HI> pa&s;s
what Negatives and Prohibitions he plea&s;es, the Nece&s;&s;ity of
tho&s;e Manufactures will make their own Way, and the Peo|ple
mu&s;t wear them, or wear nothing at all, for they have no
equivalent Manufacture to place in the room of them; and if
they have them not from <HI>England,</HI> they will have them from
<HI>Portugal,</HI> from <HI>Italy,</HI> or from other Places, as has been the
Ca&s;e in all the Wars which have happened between <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Spain,</HI> in which Commerce has been Prohibited.</P>
<P>But the Weight does not lye in this Part. The <HI>Spaniards</HI>
may Prohibit Trade with <HI>England</HI> when they plea&s;e, they will
puni&s;h them&s;elves infinitely more than <HI>England.</HI> But take the
Trade of <HI>America</HI> into the Con&s;ideration, and truly there let
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have a Care what they do: Let them take heed,
le&s;t in&s;tead of Prohibiting their People Trading with us, that
is, with <HI>England</HI>; I &s;ay, let them take heed that we (<HI>England</HI>)
do not Prohibit their Trade with one another, and among
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>By Prohibiting the Trade among them&s;elves, and with one
another, I mean (for it requires Explanation) that it is in the
Power of <HI>England</HI> (in con&s;equence of this War, and by the
Means of it) entirely to Interrupt, nay, to Stop the Com|merce
between <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Old Spain</HI>: And thus I am come
to my Text, namely, to enquire into what the Allies may gain by
this War: How it may be carried on by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI>
Nation, in &s;uch a Manner, as that Old <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould ne|ver
more have any Commerce with <HI>America</HI>; that is to &s;ay, not
<HI>Exclu&s;ively,</HI> that they &s;hould no more call it their own Trade,
but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America</HI> &s;hall be entirely &s;et free, as to
Trade; &s;hall be Independent of Old <HI>Spain</HI>; receive no Laws
or Limitations from them; but be at full Liberty to Trade
with all the World, if they plea&s;e; or if we plea&s;e, rather;
<PB N="20" REF="24">
for it would be meet to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;ome Limitation on our
Side too.</P>
<P>Nor do I concern the Civil Government of <HI>New Spain,</HI> in
any Part of this Provi&s;ion; <HI>England</HI> (or <HI>Great-Britain</HI>) &s;eeks
no Conque&s;ts; all they covet is to e&s;tabli&s;h Peace, and extend
Trade, and this we &s;eem to have fairly before us in the ap|proaching
War. If the <HI>Spaniards</HI> cannot &s;ee the Fate that at|tends
them in it (as it &s;eems to me they do not) they mu&s;t go
on, and venture the Con&s;equences; the thing is plain to me,
they run the Hazard of lo&s;ing all the Sovereignty of their
Trade in <HI>America,</HI> by a War.</P>
<P>They may keep the Sovereignty of the Country, if they
plea&s;e, or if they can; that is, if the Natives will &s;ubmit to it:
but they would &s;oon have no Commerce to it, no Communi|cation
with it, other than in common with the re&s;t of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, <HI>England</HI> will have it in their Power to limit
and re&s;train; that is, it &s;hall be in the Power of <HI>England</HI> to
take off all the Re&s;traints and Limitations of Trade, which
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have impo&s;ed, and do now impo&s;e upon the <HI>A|mericans,</HI>
and upon their own People there, and lay the Trade
open to the whole World; holding the Hands of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Government &s;o, that they &s;hould have no Power to impo&s;e a|ny
Terms of Commerce upon them in <HI>America,</HI> any more.</P>
<P>This is explaining my &s;elf fully, as to the General Head of
Commerce; and as that Commerce is now Stated by the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>
Government, between their Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> and
Old <HI>Spain,</HI> or indeed all the re&s;t of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that the State of the Trade between Old
and New <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;tands thus: The <HI>Spaniards</HI> having Planted
<HI>Mexico,</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> and all the va&s;t Country between, in the
Nature of a Colony; conquered, or extirpated the Natives,
and taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Country as their own; in con|&s;equence
of this Right, they give Laws of Commerce to
the Inhabitants, as well Natives, as <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ettled there;
the&s;e Laws (like our Act of Navigation) are made up briefly
thus, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>America</HI> &s;hould drive
no Trade, or in any manner Corre&s;pond or Negotiate with
any Nation of <HI>Europe,</HI> Directly, or Indirectly, but by the
Licentiate, or Allowance of the <HI>Con&s;ulade</HI> at <HI>Seville,</HI> that is
to &s;ay, the Chamber of the <HI>Contractration</HI> at <HI>Seville,</HI> and by
their Order; and in &s;uch <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships, and no other, as &s;hall
be Licen&s;ed in the &s;ame <HI>Con&s;ulade,</HI> or Council of Trade:
which, by the way, is call'd a Royal <HI>Council of Com|merce,</HI>
and &s;o it is the Licen&s;e of the King.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="25">
This <HI>Council of Commerce</HI> not only limits what Ships
&s;hall go out, but the Per&s;ons who &s;hall be allowed to go over
in tho&s;e Ships, and all the Cargoes or Quantities of Goods
that they &s;hall carry with them, and the Returns made for them;
which are all Regi&s;tred in their Books: They have al&s;o other
particular Powers and Limitations, which the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Trade
is bound to &s;ubmit to; but I am now upon Generals only, I &s;hall
come farther into the Particulars pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>As <HI>America</HI> is to Old <HI>Spain</HI> what we properly call a con|quer'd
Country, &s;o they (even the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that are &s;ettled
there) are Govern'd in an Arbitrary Way, as a conquered
Nation, and that notwith&s;tanding their being Subjects of
Old <HI>Spain.</HI> Under the weight of this Arbitrary Government,
they &s;ubmit to this among the re&s;t, That no Ships are allowed
to come into any of their Ports from any Place in the World,
except from Old <HI>Spain,</HI> or by <HI>A&s;&s;iento</HI> from Old <HI>Spain,</HI> as a|bove,
or &s;ome Place or other limited in the fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment
of Old <HI>Spain</HI>; that is to &s;ay, from <HI>Guinea,</HI> or any Part of the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> they may come loaden by the &s;aid <HI>A&s;&s;ien|to</HI>
with <HI>Negroes,</HI> and with them only.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands they may go &s;o far as the <HI>Havana,</HI>
carrying no other Goods but Wines and Pipe-&s;taves, the
Growth of that I&s;land; and even of that, the Quantity is li|mited,
as well as the Ships.</P>
<P>Thus the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t is brought under one Head
of Univer&s;al Commerce, and is call'd the Trade of New
<HI>Spain,</HI> or <HI>America</HI>; and is &s;trictly confined, limited, and re|&s;trained
to Old <HI>Spain</HI> in particular, as is mentioned above;
and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in Old <HI>Spain,</HI>
or New <HI>Spain,</HI> have no Commerce, or Liberty of Com|merce
one with another, but by the Licen&s;e of their Govern|ment.</P>
<P>Now
there remains a Que&s;tion or two fit for the Govern|ment
of Old <HI>Spain</HI> to an&s;wer, rather than an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Author;
but which if they cannot an&s;wer to their own Satisfaction, it
will be yet harder for them to an&s;wer another Grand Que|&s;tion
which follows it. The fir&s;t Que&s;tions are,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Are the People of New <HI>Spain</HI> (whether Natives, that is
<HI>Indians,</HI> or natural <HI>Spaniards</HI>) compleatly ea&s;y and &s;atisfied
with tho&s;e Limitations? And would they not &s;hake them off
if it lay in their Power?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Are the Government and People of Old <HI>Spain</HI> able to
keep fa&s;t tho&s;e Bolts and Bars by which the Trade is limited,
and prevent the People of New <HI>Spain</HI> trading with the <HI>Eu|ropeans,</HI>
in ca&s;e of a War?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="26">
Then the Grand Que&s;tion follows, <HI>viz.</HI> How are the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
&s;ure, that if the Inhabitants of <HI>America</HI> &s;hall at any
time come into a free Trade with <HI>Europe,</HI> by the Means of a
War, they will ever be brought to quit that Commerce again,
having ta&s;ted the Sweets of it, e&s;pecially if they in Old <HI>Spain</HI>
cannot force them to it?</P>
<P>The&s;e Que&s;tions, rightly inquir'd into, will let the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
&s;ee (if their Eyes are not clo&s;ed) upon what preca|rious
Terms and Conditions their Tenure of the <HI>American</HI>
Trade &s;tands, and how &s;oon they may irrecoverably lo&s;e it,
if they put the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> upon a Nece&s;&s;ity of Hum|bling
their In&s;olence by a War. I &s;hall &s;peak more particu|larly
to it in its Place.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The State of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Trade in <HI>America.</HI> How tho'
it is the Property of <HI>Spain,</HI> yet it depends upon the
Ju&s;tice and Friend&s;hip of the re&s;t of the Powers of
<HI>Europe.</HI> How tho&s;e Powers (if they think fit to
withdraw that Friend&s;hip, or are provok'd to do them|&s;elves
Ju&s;tice upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI>) are able
to lay open the Trade to New <HI>Spain</HI> at one Blow, and
never &s;uffer it to return to its former Channel.</HEAD>
<P>IN almo&s;t all the Treaties which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have made
with the re&s;t of the Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> whether Treaties
of Peace, or of Commerce, they have always (from a Sen&s;e
of their own Weakne&s;s in this particular Ca&s;e) taken care to
Guarrantee their <HI>American</HI> Commerce, by Negative Clau&s;es;
wherein the &s;aid Nations and Powers have generally con&s;en|ted,
Not to Interfere in the &s;aid Trade, that is to &s;ay, Not to
&s;uffer, or at lea&s;t not to authorize, their Subjects to carry on
any Trade immediately to New <HI>Spain</HI>; contenting them&s;elves
with carrying on the &s;aid Commerce, or &s;uch Share of it as
their Subjects re&s;pectively carried on, in the ordinary Channel,
and that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;hould enjoy the &s;aid Trade in Property
as their own.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to look back to the &s;everal Clau&s;es in the
Treaties with <HI>Spain</HI> and other Nations, for the Confirmation
of this Article; 'tis enough that it is particularly Stipulated in
<PB N="23" REF="27">
the &s;everal Treaties between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and confirm'd
by &s;ub&s;equent Treaties &s;ince that of 1670: Which I men|tion
here, not to enquire how well tho&s;e Treaties have been
ob&s;erv'd, either on one Side or other; (tho' it may not be im|proper
to &s;peak of that al&s;o in its Place) but I mention it here,
I &s;ay, to let it be &s;een how &s;en&s;ible <HI>Spain</HI> has always been of
its own Weakne&s;s and Inability to pre&s;erve that Commerce,
notwith&s;tanding all the Right they may claim to it, without the
voluntary Con&s;ent of the <HI>European</HI> Powers &s;tipulating to yield
and give it up, as above.</P>
<P>It is not thus with our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in <HI>America</HI>; the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
and even the <HI>French</HI> al&s;o, have indeed the &s;ame exclu&s;ive
Right to the &s;ole Trade of their own Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> as
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> claim to the&s;e of New <HI>Spain</HI>; and they have
Laws likewi&s;e re&s;pectively enacted, &s;uch as the Act of Navi|gation
in particular, binding their Subjects to &s;uch particular
Re&s;traints and Limitations of Commerce, as are proper to
&s;ecure the Property and Sovereignty of tho&s;e Trades to the
re&s;pective Powers who&s;e Subjects they are.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> &s;ecure in their own Strength,
and always believing them&s;elves able to &s;upport and defend
their own Right, have tru&s;ted to that Strength for their
Defence; not at all &s;eeking the Guarantee or Protection of
any other Powers, for the Security of their Trade.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Inference I draw from the&s;e Premi&s;es, is, that a
War breaking out, &s;uppo&s;ing that Part to be certain, and e&s;|pecially
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> becoming Aggre&s;&s;ors, and beginning that
War, the Powers with whom &s;uch a War is begun are then
evidently di&s;charg'd from all the former Obligations of
tho&s;e Treaties; their Subjects become from that Moment free
from all the &s;tipulated Engagements and Re&s;traints relating to
that Trade; our Ships may then as freely trade to the Ports of
New <HI>Spain,</HI> as they may to any other Part of the World:
I mean freely, with re&s;pect to any Re&s;traint to be laid upon
them from their own Re&s;pective Sovereigns; as to the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
they mu&s;t do as well as they can; if their Ships of
War attack our Merchants, that's allowed to be but fair, and
we mu&s;t bear it as well as we can; but if their People will
come off to our Ships or Sloops, and buy or &s;ell, that can
be no Breach on our Side; for the War is begun already, and
all Obligations to limit that Commerce cea&s;es.</P>
<P>The Argument is Short, and to the Purpo&s;e; the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
may indeed puni&s;h their own <HI>American</HI> Subjects as they plea&s;e,
and treat them as Traytors for entring into this Commerce,
as it is contraband and prohibited by their own Laws, which
Laws are binding to their own Subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="28">
But the Allies are, by vertue of the War mutually declar'd
again&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI> and by <HI>Spain</HI> again&s;t them, effectually, and <HI>ip&s;o
Facto,</HI> di&s;charg'd from all Limitations of former Treaties for|bidding
this Commerce: And I take the more Notice of it, be|cau&s;e
'tis to be hoped the &s;aid Allies, e&s;pecially the Powers
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and the <HI>States-General,</HI> will con&s;ider very
well of it, at any &s;ub&s;equent Treaty, before they con&s;ent again
to limit their own Subjects from a Commerce, which is &s;o
many ways advantageous to them.</P>
<P>What Rea&s;on have trading Nations to tye them&s;elves down
to the arbitrary Laws of Commerce, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
may think fit tyrannically to impo&s;e upon their own People?
'Tis enough that they refu&s;e to admit any of the Prote&s;tant
Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;o much as to &s;et foot among them,
much le&s;s to trade and live among them; a Liberty which we
no where deny to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> I &s;ay, 'tis enough to be thus
excluded from re&s;iding among them; but if their own People,
<HI>at whatever Hazard,</HI> are content to trade with us, I cannot
&s;ee why we &s;hould pay &s;o much Veneration to their Govern|ment,
and their Arbitrary Laws, as to tye down the Mer|chants
from a fair Corre&s;pondence and Commerce together.</P>
<P>Let Trade take its Cour&s;e; let Exchange of Goods and
Money take its due Cour&s;e, and be uninterrupted on all Sides;
let the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the Ally'd Powers come to a good Un|der&s;tanding,
as &s;oon as our Government plea&s;es; let them
fight and agree as his Maje&s;ty thinks fit; let the Merchants be
at Liberty to extend the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commerce with their utmo&s;t
Skill; this need be no Interruption to a Peace; for what has
the peaceable Merchant to do with War and Government?</P>
<P>It is a &s;trange fit of religious Strictne&s;s, which the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
think good to practi&s;e by the Power of their <HI>right bloody</HI>
Inqui&s;ition; (<HI>viz.</HI>) that they will &s;uffer no Strangers what&s;o|ever,
unle&s;s <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, &s;o much as to &s;et a foot in
New <HI>Spain,</HI> much le&s;s to live among them; and if any <HI>En|gli&s;hman</HI>
or <HI>Dutchman</HI> attempt to live among them, if they
are di&s;cover'd, they are condemned to the Mines, and mu&s;t
go to work at <HI>Pote&s;t</HI></P>
<P>Nay, &s;o cruel are they, and &s;o unmerciful, that if an <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Ship &s;hould come upon their Coa&s;t, in the greate&s;t Di|&s;tre&s;s;
whether in Di&s;tre&s;s by Storm, and &s;o wanting perhaps
Ma&s;ts or Sails, Anchors or Cable, or Carpenters; or in Di|&s;tre&s;s
for Provi&s;ions, and are wanting Fre&s;h-water, Bread, and
other Provi&s;ions; in none of the&s;e Extremities will they (as
I have been inform'd) give them Relief, tho' they are by ex|pre&s;s
Treaties oblig'd to do it: A Piece of Inhumanity, which
<PB N="25" REF="29">
I do not find the <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Pagans</HI> are arriv'd to, in any of
the known Parts of the World.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Catholick Chri&s;tians on the other hand, will,
even in the&s;e Ca&s;es of Di&s;tre&s;s, which all other Chri&s;tian
Nations con&s;ider, u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible Stratagems to get the Ship
into their Hands; in which ca&s;e the Cargo and Ship is con&s;i&s;|cated,
and the poor Men, tho' no way offending, are perhaps made
Slaves, and &s;ent to the Mines without Redemption. Which, by
the way, (not to &s;ay any thing of the particular Cruelty
with which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> treat their Slaves, and which few
of them are able to &s;urvive many Years) is a degree beyond
what is practis'd, either at <HI>Algier</HI> or <HI>Salle, Tunis</HI> or <HI>Tripoli,</HI>
or by any the <HI>Moors</HI> of the <HI>Barbary</HI> Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>I need go no farther for the Proof of the&s;e Things, than
the Authentick Relations of tho&s;e of our own Country, who have
been upon the Spot, and who have partly &s;uffered under
tho&s;e Barbarities, and partly been Eye-witne&s;&s;es to the Suffer|ings
of others, and to the particular Method by which the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> render them&s;elves &s;o odious to the re&s;t of the
Chri&s;tian World for Cruelty and Inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>That no Nation but the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> at lea&s;t no Chri&s;tian or
<HI>Mohometan</HI> Nation that I have read of, do this but the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI>
I think I may appeal for the Proof of, to the general
Practice of the <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> in like Ca&s;es, and
in the &s;ame Country.</P>
<P>It is true, that neither of the&s;e Nations permit any other
Nations to trade in their re&s;pective Colonies: Rea&s;ons
of Trade, the Intere&s;ts of Nations, and the Property of Com|merce
demands it, that it &s;hould be &s;o; that the Trade of the
particular Colony may be re&s;erv'd carefully, &s;eparately and
di&s;tinctly, to the U&s;e and Benefit of the re&s;pective Nation to
which it of Right belongs.</P>
<P>But in any of the &s;aid Colonies, if a Ship belonging to
another Nation is manife&s;tly driven into the Port or Har|bour
by &s;tre&s;s of Weather, or is in Di&s;tre&s;s for Fre&s;h-water,
or Provi&s;ions, the Government will allow them Shelter, and
will allow them to take Fre&s;h-water, and purcha&s;e Provi&s;ions
for their Voyage; and this notwith&s;tanding the &s;tricte&s;t Pro|hibitions
of Commerece: according to the expre&s;s Scripture-Law;
<HI>If thine Enemy be hungry give him Bread to eat, and
if he be thir&s;ty give him Water to drink.</HI> Prov. xxv. 21. For
all Ships of another Nation are, in the Language of Trade,
and in the Sen&s;e of tho&s;e Laws of Navigation, <HI>a kind of
Enemy</HI>; as to Commerce, I mean, tho' otherwi&s;e in full Amity;
and even if they were in Confederacy it would be the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="30">
It is true, if the Ship &s;o di&s;tre&s;s'd &s;hall tran&s;gre&s;s the Law,
and break in upon the Ho&s;pitality which they meet with,
and &s;hall clande&s;tinely and privately offer to trade with the
Inhabitants, &s;hall <HI>break Bulk</HI> as they call it, and &s;ell any Part
of her Cargo, other than &s;hall be allow'd by the Government
of the Place, for the Payment of &s;uch Provi&s;ions as they
are allow'd to buy, in &s;uch ca&s;e they are liable to be &s;topp'd,
feiz'd upon, and the whole Ship and Goods confi&s;cated; and
this is no Wrong done to them, becau&s;e they are the Offen|ders,
and know before-hand the Con&s;equence of &s;uch a
Tre&s;pa&s;s, if it was di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>Yet even in this Ca&s;e, tho' the Ship and Goods are con|fi&s;cated,
yet the poor Men are not made Slaves; on the con|trary,
they are let go, and may &s;hift for them&s;elves; and are
oftentimes reliev'd and treated with Humanity; as may be
prov'd by very many Examples, even upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Again: If a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> or a Boat full of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> &s;hould
come to any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Colonies, and land
there, <HI>&s;o be it,</HI> that they offer to bring no Goods to land
there, again&s;t the Con&s;titution of the Commerce mention'd a|bove,
they are admitted to come on Shore, may land, and go
freely up and down, take them&s;elves a Lodging, may trade as
Merchants, or dwell as Strangers; &s;ubmitting only to all
the particular Laws of Commerce, which other People &s;ub|mit
to; nor will they meet with any Mole&s;tation or Ob&s;tru|ction;
while, on the contrary, the bare coming on Shore a|mong
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in any of their <HI>American</HI> Colonies, is
Death, or perpetual Slavery, which, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> order
it, is wor&s;e than Death: For, without injuring the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
as they are but indifferent Servants, when Servitude is their
Lot; &s;o they are the wor&s;t Ma&s;ters in the World, at lea&s;t
among either Chri&s;tians or <HI>Turks,</HI></P>
<P>This then being the State of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Colonies, and of
the Commerce, and it being (as is &s;aid) conceded to by the
<HI>European</HI> Nations, by &s;undry Treaties of Peace and Com|merce;
hence it follows, that if any of the Subjects of the
&s;aid <HI>European</HI> Nations, tempted by the extraordinary Gain of
a private Commerce with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> do either lie <HI>off</HI> and
<HI>on</HI> (as they call it) upon the Coa&s;t, with Sloops and Ships,
and &s;o trade in the Night with the <HI>Spani&s;h Perioguas</HI> and <HI>Ca|noes</HI>
which come off to them; as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of <HI>Jamaica</HI> and
the <HI>Dutch</HI> of <HI>Curacao</HI> frequently do; or do land in the Bay
of <HI>Campeache,</HI> and cut Log-wood, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from <HI>Jamaica</HI>
and <HI>New-England</HI> have always done; or trade by Force up|on
<PB N="27" REF="31">
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Chili</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> have done &s;ince
their late Licen&s;e during the Time of War;</P>
<P>If, I &s;ay, in the&s;e Ca&s;es, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> happen to fall upon
them, and take them, burn or &s;ink their Ships, and u&s;e the
Men after their u&s;ual <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Severity, tho' it be too inhu|mane
even to mention, yet the &s;everal Nations to which they
belong do not u&s;ually make this any Matter of Complaint, or
reclaim the Ships or Men as if injuriou&s;ly taken, the Trade it
&s;elf being contraband; an Example of which we have lately
had in &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships taken on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Chartagena</HI> and
<HI>Saint Martha,</HI> or thereabouts, by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cruizers, who
they call <HI>Garde de Co&s;ta's,</HI> or Guard&s;hips,</P>
<P>Not but that tho&s;e <HI>Carde de Co&s;ta's,</HI> as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call them,
commit &s;everal Depredations and almo&s;t Pyracies in taking
Ships, which are not Traders or trading; and this the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
complain of at this Time, and that I believe with good Cau&s;e.
But that by the way.</P>
<P>In General, it is true, that this Right of an exclu&s;ive Com|merce,
as it was at fir&s;t a&s;&s;um'd by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as a Proper|ty,
&s;o it is conceded to them by the A&s;&s;ent of their Neighbour
Nations, and agreed to by Treaty; the very obtaining of which
Treaty is a tacit Acknowledgment that they are not able to
maintain the exclu&s;ive Commerce by their own Power; nor
able either to re&s;train their own People, or keep the Ships of o|ther
Nations from their Coa&s;t; and this is the Rea&s;on of
my entring thus far into the Ca&s;e of the Limitations of the
Commerce, which otherwi&s;e would not be to the purpo&s;e, in
the Ca&s;e before me.</P>
<P>But to bring it down directly to the Ca&s;e in hand. With a War,
(in which War, as it is evident, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves are Ag|gre&s;&s;ors)
all the&s;e Limitations and Re&s;erves of Commerce
cea&s;e at once; the Trade is laid open, and it is fair working
not only to break in upon their Trade by all &s;uch Methods as
we find practicable, but to make &s;uch Gaps and Openings in
it, as it &s;hall never be in the Power of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to
clo&s;e and make up again, no not by a Treaty of Peace.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> (who, in Breach of tho&s;e very Trea|ties,
by which their exclu&s;ive Trade was conceded to them,
have unju&s;tly attempted to open the Trade to a Nation ex|pre&s;ly
&s;hut out,) may find them&s;elves left naked of the ju&s;t
Defence which tho&s;e former Treaties always were to them,
and &s;o may never be able to recover the exclu&s;ive Commerce of
the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies,</HI> which has been of &s;uch infinite Advan|tage
to their whole Nation, or to call the Trade their Own
any more.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="32">
Nor would it be any Inju&s;tice to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> e&s;pecially
as (I &s;ay) they are the Aggre&s;&s;ors in this War; for if during
the pa&s;t Ages tho&s;e <HI>European</HI> Nations, now ally'd again&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI>
were le&s;s opulent and le&s;s powerful in Trade, and which is above
all the re&s;t, were le&s;s united in Intere&s;ts (trading Intere&s;ts I
mean) than they may be now; and were perhaps willing to
keep Mea&s;ures with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which might in &s;ome
things be to their Di&s;advantage, rather than to let them be
laid too low, or perhaps rather than another &s;hou'd reap the &s;epa|rate
Advantage of it, as was the Ca&s;e in the late War, when
<HI>France</HI> obtain'd an Admi&s;&s;ion into the Trade to the <HI>Spani&s;h Ame|rica</HI>:
I &s;ay, tho' in tho&s;e Times the&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions might be
made to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and their Preten&s;ions to an exclu&s;ive
Trade were &s;o far confirm'd, it may not be always &s;o.</P>
<P>If this has been the Ca&s;e, it was the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s to have
pre&s;erved the Advantages which that divided Situation of the
Affairs and Intere&s;ts of <HI>Europe</HI> gave them, and to have culti|vated
that Friend&s;hip which alone was the Safety of their Com|merce;
and not by &s;uch precipitate Councils as the&s;e to open
the Door of that Commerce to a People no way in condition
to carry it on, or to protect the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in it, and pretend
(I might &s;ay, fooli&s;hly pretend) to &s;hut tho&s;e out who are able to
let them&s;elves in, and even to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>Spain</HI> it &s;elf, not of
the Trade only, but of the very Country too, whenever they
plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Advantages which I mean, when I &s;peak of
the Probable Con&s;equences of this War; and this is that which
I call going to the Bottom of things. A full Enquiry into
which will open the Eyes of <HI>Europe,</HI> and let us &s;ee farther per|haps
than ever before, whether I have wrong'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
in &s;aying they know not what they are doing; that their
Mea&s;ures are ab&s;urd and ridiculous: in a Word, if I had &s;aid
they were mad, (that is to &s;ay their Mini&s;ters and Managers,
whoever they are; I &s;ay, if I had concluded them mad, or
next door to it;) it had been, in my Opinion, the kinde&s;t thing
I could have &s;aid of them.</P>
<P>To have &s;aid, they had taken the&s;e Steps with their Eyes
open, with their Rea&s;on in its full Exerci&s;e, with their Poli|ticks
free from Di&s;traction, mu&s;t have been to have &s;ug|ge&s;ted
wor&s;e things of them than I am willing to charge
them with, and to have intimated, that they were a Set of
Men in a Plot or Con&s;piracy to betray their Ma&s;ter, and ruin
their Country.</P>
<P>But be it which of the two you plea&s;e, it &s;eems to me that
<HI>Spain</HI> may have an Occa&s;ion to look back with &s;ome Re|proach
<PB N="29" REF="33">
upon its late Politicks, in Leaguing with a Prince &s;o
very lately their Enemy, and &s;o ill able to be their Friend; a|gain&s;t
two Powers, <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> &s;o very able
to ruin them, and which &s;hould have been the two la&s;t Na|tions
in the World that <HI>Spain</HI> ought to have differ'd with;
and out of which Quarrel they will not find it &s;o ea&s;y to de|liver
them&s;elves, as perhaps they imagine; that is to &s;ay, with|out
deep Wounds in their Con&s;titution, e&s;pecially as to
Trade. And this is what I meant, when I &s;aid, as the Clerks
(<HI>Culprit</HI>) do to the Pri&s;oner, who they know will be ca&s;t up|on
his Tryal, <HI>God &s;end you a good Deliverance</HI>; intimating at

Nation, and every Prince, and every Power, re&s;train'd only

<P><PB N="30" REF="34">
Contrary to the meaner Principles upon which Princes too
often make War, the King fights not for Fame: He is placed

<P>This &s;eems then to be the State of the approaching War.
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> acts the Part of the World's Protector. The King,
linking the Nations in a &s;trong Confederacy, oppo&s;es the aggre&s;|&s;ing
Di&s;turbers with &s;uch an early and &s;uperior Hand, that they
find them&s;elves di&s;abled in the very Infancy of their Undertaking.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> (ob&s;tinate and opiniatre) beginning at
the wrong End of their Work, break out into a War,
with &s;o little Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s, that the World looks on
with Surprize, to &s;ee them act &s;o as their Friends can have
no Hope, and their Enemies no Fear, from the Event of the
Undertaking.</P>
<P>A Town impregnable, even by its Situation, and made
more &s;o by the Addition of terrible Fortifications; open to
the Sea, and their Enemies Ma&s;ters of the Bay, able to relieve
it as often as they plea&s;e: What &s;trange, unaccountable Be|ginnings
are the&s;e: <HI>Spain</HI> ought to remember their Ance&s;tors
ill Conduct at the Siege of <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> which on the &s;ingle
Article of its being ea&s;ily reliev'd by Sea, <HI>held out a Siege</HI> of
<PB N="31" REF="35">
three Years and four Months, and co&s;t the <HI>Spaniards</HI> 66000
Men to conquer; whereas being not to be reliev'd by Sea,
the late Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> took it in twelve Days.</P>
<P>This Town, with all the Advantages of Situation and For|tification,
has in it a numerous Garri&s;on of old Veteran Sol|diers,
commanded by experienc'd Officers, furni&s;hed with all
things needful for a vigorous Defence, and covered with a
&s;trong Squadron of twelve large capital Men of War, &s;uch as
no twenty Ships that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> may get together will
dare to engage.</P>
<P>To attack this Place, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> whole Infantry are a|bout
20000 at the mo&s;t, who (if I may &s;peak without boa&s;t|ing)
are no more able to attack the Town, to any pur|po&s;e,
than twenty Men would be to take the Tower of
<HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>If the King of <HI>Spain</HI> fails in this Enterprize, 'tis very likely
he ruins the Infantry who are before it; and tho' his Kingdoms
are indeed very large, yet we all know, that it is not the ea|&s;ie&s;t
thing in the World to rai&s;e a new Army in <HI>Spain</HI>; 'tis
not like <HI>Germany,</HI> which (as one &s;ays, travelling thro' it) is
an inexhau&s;tible Store-hou&s;e for Men, and tho&s;e Men all
born Soldiers.</P>
<P>But in <HI>Spain</HI> it is quite a different Ca&s;e: not but that the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> are very good Troops, when well paid, well
cloath'd, di&s;ciplin'd, and led abroad from Home; but <HI>Spain</HI> is
more fruitful of any thing than Men: there are &s;o many go a|broad,
and &s;o very few &s;tay at home; &s;o many turn Prie&s;ts,
and mu&s;t not fight; are poor, dejected, and cannot fight;
or are <HI>Lazy Dons</HI> among the Gentry, and will not fight, that
it is the harde&s;t thing in the World to rai&s;e an Army in <HI>Spain,</HI>
at lea&s;t with Expedition.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tands their Affair at home, and in this unhappy Po|&s;ture
they are beginning the War; a Po&s;ture that I think they
are the fir&s;t People that ever began a War in before.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they &s;trike a Stroke at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> they ought to
expect all the Allies to declare again&s;t, and fall upon them;
<HI>France</HI> in the fir&s;t Place, we may &s;uppo&s;e will be expected
upon their Frontiers with two Armies, one in <HI>Navarr,</HI> and
the other in <HI>Rou&s;illion</HI>; and in that Figure we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee
how they will go on.</P>
<P>Let us now take a View of the Situation of their Affairs
as to Trade, and particularly as to that Part of their Commerce
of which I have &s;poken &s;o much, <HI>viz.</HI> the Trade of New
<HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="36">
While the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Squadron remains on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>A|merica,</HI>
&s;uppo&s;e in the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> or upon the Coa&s;ts
of <HI>Porto-Belo</HI> and <HI>Carthagena,</HI> either the <HI>Spaniards</HI> mu&s;t fight
that Fleet, or otherwi&s;e remove it, or there's an end put to
their Commerce on that Side, all at once.</P>
<P>It is objected, that a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Squadron may indeed inter|rupt
the Commerce in this or that particular Place, but that
this will not effectually ruin the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Trade. The Coa&s;t of
<HI>America</HI> (as po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) is a large Place, 'tis
extended in a va&s;t Length, from the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> or the
North-mo&s;t Part of the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and in the Lati|tude
of 24 to 25 Degrees to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Surinam,</HI> and even
to the Month of the Gulph of <HI>Paria,</HI> and the l&s;le of <HI>Trinida|do,</HI>
and farther, to the Latitude of five Degrees: So that
here is a Length of 1000 Miles, or thereabouts, in a Line
North and South, be&s;ides reckoning the Depth of the Bay,
and the Indentings of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Yacatan,</HI> the Bay of <HI>Cam|peachy,</HI>
the Gulph of <HI>Honduras, Darien,</HI> and others, which
make the Coa&s;t above 2500 Miles in Length; of all which I
&s;hall &s;peak again in the next Chapter.</P>
<P>In the mean time, to give the Objection its utmo&s;t Stre&s;s,
they add, that the Heat of the Climate, the Unhealthine&s;s of
the particular Places where the Station of &s;uch Ships mu&s;t be,
and the want of Provi&s;ions, are &s;uch, as that no <HI>European</HI>
Fleet can bear to be con&s;tantly &s;tation'd in tho&s;e Seas.</P>
<P>That as well at <HI>La Vera Cruz,</HI> as at <HI>Porto-Belo,</HI> which
are the two Centres of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Commerce, the Air is &s;o
unhealthy by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive Heats, that even the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
them&s;elves cannot dwell there, and only come at the
particular times of Trade, when the Ships from Old <HI>Spain</HI> ar|rive,
when they buy their Goods, deliver their Money, fini&s;h
their Di&s;patches and Letters to <HI>Europe,</HI> and return again, the
former to the great City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and the latter to <HI>Panama,</HI>
and thence to <HI>Lima,</HI> and the other Ports on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Pe|ru</HI>
and <HI>Chili</HI> in the <HI>South-Seas.</HI></P>
<P>That this is evident at this time, for that the Galeons being
(as it were) be&s;ieged, or block'd up by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Squadron,
their Men pre&s;ently grow &s;ickly, and dye a-pace; nor perhaps
are the Men in the Squadron it &s;elf quite free, tho' being bet|ter
furni&s;h'd with Provi&s;ions than the <HI>Spaniards, for the Coun|try
yields little or nothing there-abouts</HI>; I &s;ay, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Sai|lors
being better furni&s;hed, and better taken care of, and bet|ter
fed, the Men are by con&s;equence better able to bear the
Inconvenience of the Sea&s;on: yet the Place is allowed to be
&s;uch as admits no long Stay.</P>

<P>I am the more willing to give the utmo&s;t Length to the&s;e
&s;eeming Objections, becau&s;e when they &s;hall be fully and un|an&s;werably

as a particular Traffick of their own; and calculated
for a particular Cau&s;e, which wanting &s;ome Cordials, knows
not where to find or make any better.</P>
<P>It is true, the Coa&s;t of <HI>America</HI> (as now po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the
<HI>Spaniards</HI>) is exceeding large, as is de&s;cribed; and that the
great Gulph of <HI>Mexico</HI> is not to be block'd up by a Squadron
of Ships; the &s;everal Ports for Trade being &s;o remote one
from another, and that in the whole the Coa&s;t may lie exten|ded
above 2000 Miles.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e true, that the Ports of <HI>La Vera Cruz</HI> and <HI>Porto
Belo,</HI> which are at pre&s;ent the Centre of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Com|merce
in tho&s;e Parts, are unhealthy dangerous Climates, the
Shores de&s;titute of Provi&s;ions, the Heats exce&s;&s;ive, airle&s;s, and
not refre&s;h'd with Land Breezes, as in other Places; and that
even the <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves are not able to bear the Extreams
of the intemperate Sea&s;ons, &s;uch as the Summer's Heat, and
the Winter's Rain, e&s;pecially about <HI>Porto Belo.</HI></P>
<P>But the Mi&s;take of all this lies in the Ignorance of tho&s;e
that lay the Stre&s;s of this Cau&s;e, upon the po&s;ting an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Navy or Squadron only for the Interrupting this Commerce;
whereas there is nothing more plain, than that the Ally'd
Powers are able at once, not only to Interrupt the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Commerce, but to put an entire End to it, and in a Word, break
off all &s;ettled Corre&s;pondence between the two Countries, I

their Ships or Men to lye upon an unwhole&s;ome Coa&s;t,
and poi&s;on them&s;elves with the &s;tagnate Air of <HI>Darien</HI> or the
<HI>Ba&s;timentos.</HI></P>
<P>Not but that on this Occa&s;ion, the Galeons being in the
Port, it became nece&s;&s;ary to po&s;t a Squadron, as Admiral <HI>Ho|&s;ier</HI>
has been po&s;ted; to &s;tagnate the Money, as well as give
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> a Ta&s;te of the &s;tagnate Vapours of the Place,
and to keep them where they were. If they are ill furni&s;h'd
with Provi&s;ions, if the Country cannot &s;upply them, if the
Stores in their Ships are not &s;ufficient for them, they are at
home, they mu&s;t take care of them&s;elves; no doubt but by
<PB N="34" REF="39">
Land-Carriage, or by the great Lake of <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> which
runs eighty Leagues within the Land, and reaches within fif|teen
Leagues of the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> they may be &s;ufficiently fur|ni&s;hed
with Provi&s;ions, at lea&s;t may have &s;ome Relief in their
pre&s;ent Exigence; for it is very well known, that the Country
of <HI>Guatimala,</HI> bordering on that great Lake, is the mo&s;t fruitful,
plea&s;ant, and plentiful of any Part of <HI>Spani&s;h America</HI>; or
el&s;e their own Accounts of it are very fal&s;e, and they have
de&s;cribed it much more to their own Advantage, than they can
make out, when they find occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>But if it &s;hould be &s;o, that they are di&s;tre&s;s'd, for Pro|vi&s;ions,
as I &s;ay above, <HI>they are at Home</HI>; they are under
no Re&s;traints; they have no Enemies landed upon them; they
may &s;end for Provi&s;ions where they are to be had, and may
&s;end Expre&s;&s;es to the Governours of the &s;everal Countries to
&s;upply them, and to find Means to convey them: Certainly
the Governours will not &s;uffer the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Ships
to want Victualing, or &s;uffer the poor Seamen to &s;tarve
upon their own Coa&s;ts, and (as may be &s;aid) at their own
Doors.</P>
<P>But we are not &s;peaking of an Advantage to <HI>Great Britain</HI>
only in this pre&s;ent depending Article of Blocking up the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>
Galeons, which is a thing of to-day, and, as we may &s;ay,
will be over to-morrow; is done to &s;erve a particular Occa|&s;ion,
and will &s;erve that Occa&s;ion mo&s;t effectually; for we &s;ee
how ill able the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are to bear the Di&s;appointment, and
what a Check it gives to their Enterprizes, how low their
Credit runs in <HI>Europe,</HI> and how even their Auxiliaries and
Confederates (as it were) &s;tand &s;till 'till they &s;ee from
what other Springs the promis'd Streams of Money will
flow.</P>
<P>The Occa&s;ion therefore is abundantly &s;erved by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
A'dmiral po&s;ting his Squadron at the Entrance of the Harbour
of <HI>Porto Belo,</HI> and hindering the Galeons from coming out,
&s;preading the Sea with his Crui&s;ers, and interrupting their
Commerce; and in a Word, locking up their Money &s;o, as
that tho' it be in their own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it is yet out of their
Reach, and rendered (at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent) as u&s;ele&s;s to
them, as if it was in the Mines at <HI>Poto&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' it is far from being mention'd as any part of the Ad|vantages
hinted at in my Title, and which are offer'd to the
Allies in the pre&s;ent War, any farther than it is an Accident
to the Beginning, and a particular Circum&s;tance which falls
in to the Encouragement of our Friends, and the great Di&s;ap|pointment
of the Enemy; yet it mu&s;t be acknowledged too,
<PB N="35" REF="40">
that it is a very great Advantage in its Kind; and it &s;hows
the World, that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> with all the Funds of their
immen&s;e Trea&s;ure, which it may be &s;aid they are Ma&s;ters of,
beyond all the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI>; yet are &s;o unhappily &s;ituated,
that they mu&s;t as it were be oblig'd to ask their Neighbours
leave to bring it home, and dare not venture abroad with it,
if but nine or ten Men of War appear upon their Coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all this, and &s;uppo&s;ing this Expedition
of <HI>Porto-Belo</HI> were to be reckon'd as nothing in the pre&s;ent
Account of the Advantages of the War; it is manife&s;t that
their whole <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Commerce is in the Hands, and at the
Mercy of the Allies, in this War; that we are able to put an
End to it at once, if we think fit; and that not for the pre|&s;ent
only, but for the time to come, whenever the Govern|ment
thinks fit to enter into Mea&s;ures for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>And not to pretend to lead our Leaders, or to direct them,
in who&s;e Direction the whole Government is already
&s;o wi&s;ely &s;teer'd; I may venture to lay before you the Schemes
of former Times, and make &s;ome &s;mall Inferences from
them; which if our Governours plea&s;e to make any U&s;e of,
they may doubtle&s;s very much improve; and if they do not
think fit to make u&s;e of, they will, 'tis hoped, not be di&s;|pleas'd
at any well-de&s;igning Subject (however injuriou&s;ly
mi&s;repre&s;ented) mentioning &s;uch things for their Service as
are apparently capable of an&s;wering the End if accepted, and
can be Hurtful to none if rejected.</P>
<P>Nor can it be &s;aid, that it is a di&s;covering the Weakne&s;s
of the Enemy to them&s;elves, and putting them upon &s;ecuring
them&s;elves where they lie open, &s;ince the Enemy are far from
being ignorant of the Di&s;advantage they lie under; they are
not &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of the weak Part, and have been &s;en&s;ible of it
many Years ago, but find there is no Po&s;&s;ibility of preventing
the Con&s;equences, but by being Ma&s;ters at Sea; which is an
Article that never was but once their Chance, and is never
likely to happen to them again; at lea&s;t it will not in this War,
whatever it may do in After-times.</P>
<P>If &s;ome things offer in <HI>this War,</HI> which have not offer'd be|fore,
at lea&s;t not to be &s;o practicable in any former War;
and if wi&s;er Heads than mine have not yet &s;een them, or

his Mea&s;ures with his Governours, but his Mea&s;ures with
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and with them only.</P>
<P>It was about the Year 1655, when the War with <HI>Spain</HI>
continuing, after &s;everal other Attempts, the Council of War
received &s;ome Propo&s;als laid before them by the Govern|ment's
Order, for an Expedition to the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies</HI>;
(and as I had it not from Hi&s;tory, but by a very Authentick,
tho' Verbal Relation, from a Member of the very Council of
War, to whom it was referr'd) a De&s;cent was propos'd
to be made upon the Continent of New <HI>Spain</HI>; This was
in order to &s;eize &s;ome Strength there, keep the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
it, fortifie and place a Garri&s;on in it, to be defended after|wards
again&s;t all the Power of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> &s;o by that means
to extend them&s;elves Gradually into the Country, plant and
cultivate, &s;till fortifying as they &s;hould go on, 'till at length they
might e&s;tabli&s;h a Colony there, and &s;o &s;hare with the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>America</HI>; and perhaps lying between the
two great Empires which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> North and
South <HI>America,</HI> or as in particular they may be call'd, <HI>Mexico</HI>
and <HI>Peru,</HI> cut off the Communication, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the Shores
of both Seas, that is to &s;ay, the Ports of <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI>
(which is much the &s;ame as <HI>Porto Belo</HI>) and <HI>Panama.</HI></P>
<P>By this Propo&s;al, it was &s;uppos'd, a Door would be immediate|ly
open'd to a Commerce with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> that a
Trade would be carried on to infinite Advantage, a va&s;t Expence
of the Woollen Manufacture follow, and a return in Specie

be immediately and directly made to <HI>England</HI>; without tra|ding
about by old <HI>Spain,</HI> and under the Limitations and Re&s;tricti|ons
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as it always was before; and that in
particular, while the War continued, very great Sums would
frequently fall into the Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by keeping a
certain Number of Ships of War always crui&s;ing in tho&s;e
Seas; and having the Port of &s;uch Place as &s;hould be con|quer'd
to retreat into, refit, revictual, and &s;helter them&s;elves
upon all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Offer was &s;pecious, the Adventure bold, and the Suc|ce&s;s
promi&s;ing: But upon farther and mature Deliberation,
tho' the Enterpri&s;e was accepted and undertaken in the Gene|ral,
yet the Mea&s;ures were chang'd; the Place expected to
be attack'd was rejected, and a new Scheme (as &s;ome &s;aid, of
his own) was appointed for the Expendition, and that was to
attack the <HI>Havana,</HI> the principal Port, and the chief Strength
of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America</HI>; at lea&s;t it was, and is &s;till a
Place of the greate&s;t Importance to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> of any in
all their <HI>American</HI> Dominions, as &s;hall appear pre&s;ently;
The Rea&s;ons given for this Alteration of Coun&s;els were &s;uch,
as pre&s;ently made an Impre&s;&s;ion upon All that were con&s;ulted
about it, and the new Undertaking was unauimou&s;ly re&s;olv'd
on.</P>
<P>In order to carry on an Enterpri&s;e of &s;uch Importance, a
Fleet and an Army was prepar'd, and that with all the Ex|pedition
and Secrecy, that &s;uch a De&s;ign call'd for: Nor 'till
the Troops were ready to Embark, was it &s;o much as gue&s;s'd
at whither they were de&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>However the jealous <HI>Spaniards,</HI> made afraid from the
meer Importance of the Place, rather than by any certain
Knowledge of the De&s;ign, &s;ent away &s;ome Ships of War,
with Stores of Ammunition and Supply of Troops for the
Garri&s;ons of the <HI>Havana,</HI> and of <HI>Chartagena,</HI> as the two mo&s;t
&s;ignificant Places they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in all their <HI>American</HI> Domi|nions,

<P>The De&s;ign was at la&s;t made known: only to amu&s;e the

be attack'd: The Squauron &s;ail'd, the Troops about 8 or
9000 Men, and commanded by the fam'd Colonels <HI>Penn</HI> and
<HI>Venables.</HI></P>

wi&s;e by their Misfortunes, and re&s;olving not to be beaten,
unle&s;s cut in pieces, they went on with more united Coun|cils,
and a better Agreement than before; by which means,
and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being not well provided for their Defence,
they took the I&s;land, and, to &s;horten the Story, <HI>Jamaica</HI> has
been <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>It is not to be wondred at if the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> after this narrow
E&s;cape, went to work with the Fortifications of the <HI>Havana,</HI>
and made it very &s;trong; adding a &s;trong Ca&s;tle at the North
Part of the Town it &s;elf, and adding &s;everal Batteries at the
Entrance, whereof one under the Ca&s;tle <HI>El Morro</HI> has a particular
Battery of twelve exceeding long Bra&s;s Cannon, which they
call the Twelve Apo&s;tles, and which carry, if the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
may be believ'd, a fifty-&s;ix Pound Ball.</P>
<P>Since this, and even while they were alarm'd with the
coming of a <HI>French</HI> Squadron into tho&s;e Seas, in the late
War under Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pointy,</HI> when they took <HI>Chartagena,</HI>
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> apprehending the De&s;ign was again&s;t the <HI>Ha|vana,</HI>
they cau&s;ed the whole City to be accurately fortified,
and a Fort and a Cittadel to be re-built; by which the Town
as well as the Port has obtain'd the Name of a very &s;trong
Place, tho' far from being what the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend to &s;ay
of it, Invincible. But if it really were &s;o at this time, or if
it was five-fold &s;tronger than it is, it is of no Value or Im|portance
in the Scheme I am now to lay down, nor &s;hall it
be of any U&s;e to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Ca&s;e before me, any more
than the Strength of any other Place; for what &s;ignifies its
Strength, when it is not to be attack'd?</P>
<P>It is not the Fortifications upon the Shore that will Im|port
any thing in this War; the Superiority by Sea is the
<PB N="40" REF="46">
thing we lay the whole Weight upon, and being Ma&s;ters of
the Sea is that which the Sum of Affairs depends upon.</P>
<P>However 'tis nece&s;&s;ary a little to &s;tate the Importance of this
Port of the <HI>Havana,</HI> in as brief Terms as I can, becau&s;e this
was the Rea&s;on why <HI>Oliver</HI> and his Council pitch'd upon it
to make their Attack. By the Import of it, I mean, the Im|port
of it to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as they are now po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, and
as it would have been to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> if <HI>Oliver</HI>'s General had
happen'd to take it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Havana</HI> is the be&s;t Port without Di&s;pute in all the
<HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies</HI>; it is &s;ituate on the North Side of the
I&s;te of <HI>Cuba,</HI> oppo&s;ite to the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> in the Latitude
of twenty three Degrees North.</P>
<P>The Gulph of <HI>Florida</HI> being the only practicable Out-let or
Pa&s;&s;age from the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> by which all the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Ships make their Return from <HI>America,</HI> and by which they
enter into Ocean, which they therefore call <HI>Di&s;emboguing</HI>;
I &s;ay, the Gulph being the only Practicable Way, all the <HI>Ga|leons</HI>
from <HI>Porto-Belo,</HI> and the other Ships called the <HI>Flota,</HI>
from <HI>La Vera Craz,</HI> come fir&s;t to the <HI>Havana</HI> in their Pa&s;&s;age
home, and there being in Safety from either Seas or Enemies (for
it is a Port as &s;afe from Winds and Storms, as from Enemies)
they wait 'till they meet from all Parts, and, as they call it,
make up their Fleet.</P>
<P>N. B. There is another Way between <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI>
which the Seamen call the <HI>Windward Pa&s;&s;age,</HI> which the
Ships from <HI>Jamaica</HI> &s;ometimes venture thorough. But
'tis hazardous and difficult, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> never make
u&s;e of it, e&s;pecially with their Fleet.</P>
<P>N. B. It &s;hould al&s;o have been ob&s;erv'd, that the Fleets
from old <HI>Spain,</HI> make this Port of the <HI>Havana</HI> be the
fir&s;t Place of their Arrival, when they are outward bound,
and coming &s;o far in a Body; they then &s;eparate as their Or|ders
direct: the Ships for the South go away to <HI>Porto|Belo,</HI>
and tho&s;e to the We&s;t go to <HI>La Vera Cruz</HI>; the
Men of War attending them, or not, as they &s;ee Occa|&s;ion,
and as Inteiligence of things directs.</P>
<P>So that both ways, whether out or home, the <HI>Havana</HI> is the
only Place of Safety, where the Plate Fleet rendezvous, and
where they are cover'd from all Dangers; nor wou'd the
Voyage be ea&s;ily made without &s;uch a <HI>Halfway-Port</HI> to &s;top
in, to recruit, to take in Refre&s;hments, Provi&s;ious, and e&s;pecially
Fre&s;h-water; after &s;o long a Run, as it is from <HI>Cadiz</HI>
thither, in which they have no Place to touch at for-Refre&s;h|ment,
except it be the <HI>Canary-I&s;lands,</HI> where their Stay is but
<PB N="41" REF="47">
very &s;hort, the Road being not at all &s;afe, either from Wind or
Weather, or Enemies, even the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Rovers not excepted.</P>
<P>Having thus given you a full Account of the Import of this
Place to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> I have only this to add; That in the
propos'd Advantages to us for cutting off the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Com|merce,
and totally intercepting their Corre&s;pondence with one
another, which is the Scheme to be propo&s;ed, This mighty
Port, this well-fortified City, and this excellent Harbour, &s;hall
be of no Signification or Importance one way or other; it
&s;hall neither be worth any thing to us to take, or to the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
to keep: Allowing <HI>England</HI> to have only the Superiority of naval
Strength, and to be Ma&s;ters of the Sea, which I think I may
venture to &s;ay is not to be doubted, and all the re&s;t &s;hall fall
in of Cour&s;e; the <HI>Havana</HI> &s;hall be as u&s;ele&s;s to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
as <HI>Majorca</HI> in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> (comparatively &s;peaking)
nor &s;hall it be able, or the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by its help be able, to pre|vent
our Interrupting their Commerce, and in &s;hort, taking it
wholly into our own Hands.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is Thus:</P>
<P>There is on the &s;ame I&s;land of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and on the &s;ame North-Side of
it, open to the &s;ame grand Pa&s;&s;age of the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> another
Port or Harbour, call'd the Harbour or Gulph of <HI>Honda</HI>; it is about
nine Leagues to the We&s;tward of the <HI>Havana,</HI> and upon the very
&s;ame Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Conveniences of this Port (among many others) are &s;ome in
particular which relate to the Subject in Hand, <HI>viz.</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. That it is a convenient Place to form a Settlement upon, and to
fortifie, &s;o as with little Expence to make it unapproachable by Land,
and con&s;equently not to be interrupted by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That it commands a fruitful, and plentiful, and healthy Country,
where not only all manner of Provi&s;ions may be had, but where &s;uch
ea&s;y and &s;ecure Planting would follow, as not <HI>Jamaica</HI> it &s;elf would
go beyond it, as well for Trade, as &s;upply of Inhabitants.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. But that which is above all the re&s;t, the Situation is &s;uch by
Sea, that not a Ship, much le&s;s a Fleet of Ships, can go in or out,
to or from the <HI>Havana,</HI> from or to the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> or the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Carthagena, Porto-Belo,</HI> &amp;c. but they mu&s;t pa&s;s by this Port,
and even in &s;ight of the Men of War riding here; &s;o that <HI>England</HI> has
no more to do than to po&s;t a Squadron of Ships in this Port, ma|king
it their Station, and keeping &s;ome of them crui&s;ing upon the
Coa&s;t of the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> as they &s;ee Occa&s;ion; and let any one that
under&s;tands the Situation of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Commerce, tell us how they
will carry it on without our Leave, and which Way they will get out
of the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> or out of the Gulph of <HI>Honduras,</HI> or (to u&s;e
their own Language) how they will <HI>Di&s;embogus,</HI> that is, get into the
Ocean, wihtout (as I &s;ay) asking us Leave.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If this is their Ca&s;e (to make the ju&s;t Inference from Things as I
go) will any Man &s;ay I was too arrogant in &s;aying the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;eem|ed
<PB N="42" REF="48">
not to know what they were doing, when they begin a Quarrel
with <HI>England,</HI> that their Proceedings were ab&s;urd, and ridiculons,
and that they &s;eemed to be little off from Di&s;traction?</P>
<P>The farther entering into this Scheme of Management, for the in|terrupting
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Commerce, requires more Room than can be al|lowed
to any thing from &s;o mean a Pen. But if any Writer, or Wri|ter's
Ma&s;ter, can rai&s;e one Objection again&s;t it, that cannot with unan|&s;werable
Force be refuted, I would be glad to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>Let the greate&s;t Friend to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, or the greate&s;t Ene|my
to the Author of this, tell me, if they can, which way the Flo|ta's
from <HI>La Vera Cruz</HI> &s;hall get out into the Ocean, which way the
<HI>Galeons</HI> &s;hall beat it up again&s;t a Leeward Tide (as the Seamen call it)
from <HI>Porto-Belo,</HI> and not come under the command of this Port, or
that of <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Pa&s;&s;age already mentioned, which &s;ometimes our Ships
from <HI>Jamaica</HI> do make u&s;e of, which is therefore called the <HI>Wind|ward
Pa&s;&s;age,</HI> and which runs from the Ea&s;t Point of <HI>Jamaica,</HI>
North-We&s;t, and then fleering North, goes between the I&s;lands of
<HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing among innumerable I&s;lands, Sands,
Shoals, Rocks and other Dangers, leaves the Gulph of <HI>Florida</HI> on
the Larboard Side, and goes out or di&s;embogues into the Ocean, to
the North-Ea&s;t of all the <HI>Bahama</HI> I&s;lands; and it is true, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
may (that is to &s;ay, now and then a Ship may) make their E&s;cape this
Way.</P>
<P>But I refer it to the Judgment of the skilful Mariner, whether
this is a practicable Way for the whole Trade; and if it were &s;o, whe|ther
then the I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which is already <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> would not
be of the &s;ame u&s;e for that Cour&s;e, as the Bay of <HI>Honda</HI> would be
for the other.</P>
<P>I am no Projector, nor am I laying the thing down as a Propo&s;al, at
lea&s;t not here; but I think it is plain (at lea&s;t to me) that a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Squadron
po&s;ted in this Bay, may when you plea&s;e put an end to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Com|merce
in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> in &s;uch a manner, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could
never carry on any con&s;iderable Trade there again: Always &s;uppo&s;ing
what we have rea&s;on to hope will ever be the Ca&s;e, namely, that the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fleet &s;hall be Ma&s;ters of the Sea.</P>
<P>It may be pretended, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> may coa&s;t along the South
Side of that they call the <HI>North Seas,</HI> that is to &s;ay, under the North,
Share of the South <HI>America,</HI> the Coa&s;t of <HI>St. Marta, Venezcula,</HI> or the
<HI>Carata's</HI>; and &s;o to <HI>Bosco del Drago,</HI> the Gulph of <HI>Paria,</HI> and the I&s;le
<HI>De Trimidada</HI>; and &s;o going away Ea&s;t, get into the Ocean that way,
and come home with the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Fleets from the <HI>Bra&s;ils.</HI></P>
<P>All this, Eke what was &s;aid before of the <HI>Windward Pa&s;&s;age,</HI> is no
more than like a City not entirely inve&s;ted, or that tho' be&s;ieged, may
have &s;ome &s;uch &s;ecret Pa&s;&s;ages, as that now and then a &s;ingle Me&s;&s;en|ger
may e&s;cape in or out, to carry a Letter, or bring particular Intelli|gence,
but which &s;ignifies nothing at all towards its Relief, much le&s;s
towards rai&s;ing the Stage, and opening a Communication.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="49">
Having thus &s;tated the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in ca&s;e of a War, and
on &s;uppo&s;ition of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Superiority at Sea, how their Commerce
with <HI>Europe</HI> &s;hall be interrupted and broken off, and how they &s;hall be
no more able to trade, no not with their own Subjects, but by Leave
from his <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty, and his Allies: The Inference from
hence is as natural, and as plain, as that mentioned above; <HI>viz.</HI> No
Man need to ask what are our Advantages by a War with <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>I know &s;ome room lyes here for a Que&s;tion, thus: Suppo&s;e you
&s;hould thus Interrupt their Commerce, what immediate Benefit or
Advantage would that be to us? &s;eeing tho' they cannot trade &s;o freely
with one another, they may hinder the Commerce of their own Sub|jects
with the Subjects of others; and &s;o, tho' the Interruption of the
Trade be a Lo&s;s to them, it will be no Gain to us.</P>
<P>I State this Que&s;tion, not becau&s;e it is a Que&s;tion that any one who
under&s;tands the Nature of the Commerce of New <HI>Spain</HI> will ask, but
becau&s;e there are &s;ome People that will ask more Que&s;tions in half an
Hour, than&mdash;<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and becau&s;e &s;ome are (as <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays) <HI>Wi&s;er in their
own Conceit, than tho&s;e that can render a Rea&s;on</HI>: The Rea&s;ons to be gi|ven
in an&s;wer to &s;uch Que&s;tions, if any &s;hould be Weak enough to ask
them, are re&s;olved into not Argument but Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of New <HI>Spain</HI> cannot trade with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of Old
<HI>Spain,</HI> Experience tells us they will trade with any Body: If their own
Ships cannot come at them, to bring the Merchandize of <HI>Europe</HI> to
them, 'tis evident they mu&s;t have tho&s;e Merchandizes, and they will
&s;eek to be &s;upply'd with them where they can.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves know this too well; the Marquis <HI>de Puzz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
Bueno,</HI> in his late Memorial, complains of this as one of the Effects of
Admiral <HI>Ho&s;ier</HI>'s Squadron lying at the <HI>Be&s;timento's,</HI> viz. that it covers and
protects what he calls the Contraband Trade, to the Prejudice of their
Commerce.</P>
<P>Let any one grant me that taking Po&s;t, or Stationing a Squadron at
the Bay of <HI>Honda,</HI> &s;hall command the Commerce of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI>
as I think it evidently appears it would, I will an&s;wer for the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
that they will grant it &s;hall lay open their Trade Wholly to the Allies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> rich and at ca&s;e, abound in Money, and have
Plenty of all manner of Provi&s;ions, Wine excepted. They have the
mo&s;t delicious Fruits; they have a Profu&s;ion of Sugars for Pre&s;erving,
which they greatly delight in; the fine&s;t Sweet meats and Confections in
the World being to be had there, in the greate&s;t Plenty; they have the
<HI>Cocoa</HI> in &s;uch Plenty, that their Chocolate (which is their ordinary Re|pa&s;t)
co&s;ts them very little. They have Fle&s;h, and Fowl and Fi&s;h in a|bundance,
infinitely more than they can con&s;ume. And as for Mo|ney,
their Hou&s;es are fill'd with Plate, and their Merchants Ware-hou&s;es
piled up to the Ceilings with Che&s;ts of Silver Coin.</P>
<P>But with all this Affluence they have no Clothes; they have neither
Linnen or Woollen, Silk or Hair of their own; I mean manufactured,
and of their own making; they have indeed &s;ome Cotton, and &s;ome
Wool, and the <HI>Indians,</HI> or Natives, do in &s;ome remote Places make
&s;ome ordinary things for their own Cloathing, chiefly of Cotton, and
&s;ome cour&s;e <HI>peruvian</HI> Wool.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="50">
But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (like the <HI>Lord-Danes</HI> formerly in <HI>England,</HI> from
whole Pride and Lazine&s;s an Idle Fellow was afterwards call'd a <HI>Lurdan</HI>)
are too proud to &s;toop to any thing called Work, &s;o that they have no
Merchandize, and con&s;equently no Cloth, except what they receive
from <HI>Europe</HI>; and &s;ome <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods, &s;uch as Callicoes, and wrought
Silks of <HI>China</HI> from the <HI>Philipine</HI> I&s;lands, by the way of <HI>Acapulco.</HI></P>
<P>This Supply of Manufactures is (generally &s;peaking) the Loading of
the Galeons, including &s;ome Wines, and Oyl, and Fruit of the Growth
of Old <HI>Spain</HI>; and the&s;e Loadings chiefly con&s;i&s;t of the Woollen Manu|facture
of <HI>England,</HI> the Silks of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Linnen of <HI>Hol|land</HI>
and <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>This Supply has &s;ometimes been Interrupted by a War, as was in
particular the Ca&s;e in the fir&s;t War with <HI>France,</HI> when the Galeons were
&s;topped for two or three Years; then it was the odde&s;t thing in the
World, to &s;ee how &s;habby and ragged the <HI>Spaniards</HI> appeared, with their
Pockets full of Gold, their Tables cover'd with Plate, and their Ware-hou&s;es
(as above) heap'd up with Silver. And the Author of this &s;peaks
of particular Knowledge, that under one of the&s;e Di&s;appointments a
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchant came on board a trading Sloop, on the Coa&s;t of
St. <HI>Martha,</HI> in a <HI>Periagua,</HI> and bought as many Goods at &s;everal times
as he paid 19000 Pieces of Eight for, and had him&s;elf not a Pair of
Stockings on his Legs, and the re&s;t of his Cloaths worn into &s;uch Rags,
as an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> with but 50<HI>s.</HI> in the World would &s;corn to be &s;een in.</P>
<P>He acknowledged that they had Money enough, but no Cloths; that
every thing bore &s;uch a Price as tempted them that were Merchants to
&s;ell till they were almo&s;t naked. He brought 5000 Pieces of Eight with
him the fir&s;t time, and looking over the whole Ship's Cargo, bought as
much as came to 19000, (the Sum above-mention'd) &s;tay'd in the Sloop
all the next Day, when they &s;tood off to Sea to be out of Sight, and
went on Shore with his Goods the next Night; returning again
the Night after with more Money; and &s;o con&s;tantly, 'till he had
brought all his Money, and then &s;ent three other Merchants, who
bought all the re&s;t of the Cargo.</P>
<P>If this Trade was carry'd on thus, when at the extreme&s;t Hazard;
what would it be when, under the Protection of the Men of War, the
Ships and Sloops &s;hould come boldly to their Shores, and the Buyers be
under no Re&s;traint. Nece&s;&s;ity obliging them to consive at one another
on Shore, and no <HI>Guard de Co&s;tia's</HI> to take Cogni&s;ance at Sea?</P>
<P>Nay, what would it be when the Bay of <HI>Honda</HI> &s;hould be a free Fair,
and that all the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els that thought fit to come thither, &s;hould
trade under the Protection of the Place, and be &s;afe going and coming,
under &s;helter of the crui&s;ing Men of War?</P>
<P>Will any Man &s;ay that the Trade will not be wholly our own, that is
to &s;ay, the Allies? for the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Curacao</HI> and <HI>Surinam,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI>
at <HI>Martinico,</HI> would have their Share in the &s;ame Commerce; and any
one may an&s;wer for it, the Advantage would be &s;uch, that we &s;hould
never be concern'd, tho' there was never to be any more Peace with the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> either on this Side of the World, or on the other.</P>
