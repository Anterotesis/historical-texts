<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ABelard</HI> and <HI>Eloi&s;a</HI> flouri&s;h'd in the twel&s;th Cen|tury;
they were two of the mo&s;t di&s;lingui&s;h'd
per&s;ons of their age in learning and beauty, but for no|thing
more famous than for their unfortunate pa&s;&s;on.
After a long cour&s;e of calamities, they retired each to a
&s;everal Convent, and con&s;ecrated the remainder of their
days to religion. It was many years after this &s;epa|ration,
that a letter of <HI>Abelard</HI>'s to a friend, which
contain'd the hi&s;tory of his misfortunes, fell into the
hands of <HI>Eloi&s;a.</HI> This awakening all her tenderne&s;s,
occa&s;ion'd tho&s;e celebrated letters (out of which the fol|lowing
is partly extracted) which give &s;o lively a pi|cture
of the &s;truggles of grace and nature, virtue and
pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. <HI>Allan Ram&s;ey,</HI> on his <HI>Richy</HI>
and <HI>Sandy.</HI></HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. BURCHET.</BYLINE>
<L>WELL fare thee, <HI>Allan,</HI> who, in mother tongue,</L>
<L>So &s;weetly hath of breathle&s;s <HI>Addy</HI> &s;ung.</L>
<L>His endle&s;s fame thy nat'ral genius fir'd,</L>
<L>And thou ha&s;t written as if he in&s;pir'd.</L>
<L><HI>Richy</HI> and <HI>Sandy,</HI> who do him &s;urvive,</L>
<L>Long as thy rural Stanzas la&s;t &s;hall live.</L>
<L>The grateful &s;wains thou'&s;t made, in tuneful ver&s;e,</L>
<L>Mourn &s;adly o'er their late&mdash;lo&s;t patron's her&s;e,</L>
<L>Nor would the <HI>Mantuan</HI> bard, if living, blame</L>
<L>Thy pious zeal, or think thou'&s;t hurt his fame,</L>
<L>Since <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s inimitable lays</L>
<L>Give him an equal title to the bays.</L>
<L>When he of armies &s;ang, in lofty &s;trains,</L>
<L>It &s;eem'd as if he in the ho&s;tile plains</L>
<L>Had pre&s;ent been. His pen hath to the life</L>
<L>Trac'd ev'ry action in the &s;anguine &s;trife.</L>
<L>In council now &s;edate the chief appears,</L>
<L>Then loudly thunders in <HI>Bavarian</HI> ears;</L>
<L>And &s;till pur&s;uing the de&s;tructive theme,</L>
<L>He pu&s;hes them into the rapid &s;tream.</L>
<L>Thus beaten out of <HI>Blenheim</HI>'s neighb'ring fields,</L>
<L>The <HI>Gallic</HI> gen'ral to the victor yields,</L>
<L>Who, as <HI>Britannia</HI>'s <HI>Virgil</HI> hath ob&s;erv'd,</L>
<L>From threaten'd fate all <HI>Europe</HI> then pre&s;erv'd.</L>
<L>Nor do&s;t thou, <HI>Ram&s;ey,</HI> &s;ightle&s;s <HI>Milton</HI> wrong</L>
<L>By ought contain'd in thy melodious &s;ong;</L>
<L>For none but <HI>Addy</HI> could his thoughts &s;ublime</L>
<L>So well unriddle, or his my&s;tick rhyme.</L>
<L>And when he deign'd to let his fancy rove</L>
<L>Where &s;un-burnt &s;hepherds to the nymphs make love,</L>
<L>No one e'er told in &s;ofter notes the tales</L>
<L>Of rural plea&s;ures in the &s;pangled vales.</L>
<L>So much, oh <HI>Allan!</HI> I thy lines revere,</L>
<L>Such veneration to his mem'ry bear,</L>
<L>That I no longer could my thanks refrain</L>
<L>For what thou'&s;t &s;ung of the lamented &s;wain.</L>
