<HEAD>MEMOIRS
OF
Count TARIFF, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>COUNT <HI>Tariff,</HI> who&s;e Hi&s;tory we
are now to write, is a Per&s;on
who has been &s;o much mi&s;repre|&s;ented
among us, and painted
in &s;uch mon&s;trous Shapes, that 'tis but
a piece of Ju&s;tice to a Stranger to re&s;cue
his Character from the Mob, and to
&s;earch what may be found in ancient
Hi&s;tory concerning him.</P>
<P>So far as we have &s;earch'd into Anti|quity,
we find him lineally de&s;cended
from the ancient Line of the <HI>Tariffs,</HI> a
Family of &s;uch Quality as well as Anti|quity
in <HI>France,</HI> that they trace their Ge|nealogy
as high as any Hi&s;tory can be
<PB N="4" REF="3">
found; and they appear equal in Birth
to <HI>Commerce</HI> it &s;elf, who&s;e Antiquity no
Body doubts of.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> the chief of
his Family, is a Per&s;on, who, as well
for his proper Merit as his high Birth as
afore&s;aid, has been e&s;teemed and re&s;pected
all over <HI>Europe;</HI> and for the great Inte|re&s;t
he has in his Country, has been
&s;ought unto by mo&s;t of the Nations in
<HI>Europe,</HI> upon many occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>He always appear'd to be a Patron of
Trade, as what he e&s;teem'd was exceed|ingly
conducive to the general Good of
Mankind: As this was his e&s;pecial Aim,
&s;o he did not &s;o much apply him&s;elf to
this or that particular Branch or part of
Trade, but endeavour'd upon all occa|&s;ions
to &s;hew him&s;elf a Friend to univer|&s;al
Commerce; as it re&s;pected the Im|provement
and general Advantage of
the World, and from this Rule he con|&s;tantly
employ'd the Influence he had
on Affairs, <HI>which was not &s;mall</HI> to the Re|gulation
and good Government of Trade
in his own Country.</P>
<P>He took on him the general Manage|ment
of Commerce on the 18th of <HI>Sep|tember,</HI>
1664. which being the fir&s;t time
of his publick Appearance in the World,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
we &s;hall not enquire into any part of his
Conduct before that time.</P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner &s;ettled and made pub|lick
<HI>his Rules</HI> of Commerce; but all the
Trading part of the World were made
&s;en&s;ible of the Advantage they receiv'd
thereby, and con&s;equently began to en|tertain
a true and very great Opinion
of his Worth, and very quickly courted
his Friend&s;hip: This Nation e&s;pecially
made great Advantage of his Corre|&s;pondence,
for he was a particular Friend
to the <HI>Engli&s;h Trade,</HI> and encourag'd it
upon all Occa&s;ions: It is true, he acted
upon open Mea&s;ures of Corre&s;pondence,
and was a Friend to univer&s;al Trade, <HI>as
above:</HI> He abhorr'd Prohibitions, Re&s;tric|tions
and Exclu&s;ion of Nations in Trade;
but if he had any Peculiar, if he treated
any one Nation with Di&s;tinction more
than another, it was <HI>England;</HI> which was
all the Rea&s;on that has yet been a&s;&s;ign'd,
why &s;ome People in the Kingdom have
treated him with &s;uch Rudene&s;s and
Di&s;re&s;pect ever &s;ince: But however, they
have u&s;ed him, it is mo&s;t certain <HI>England</HI>
felt the &s;en&s;ible Advantage of his Acquain|tance,
and corre&s;ponded with him to
their great Profit, as well as Satisfaction
for &s;everal Years, receiving every Year
<PB N="6" REF="5">
great Sums of Money from him, and by
his means.</P>
<P>He was particularly a very great Friend
to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacture: He always
appear'd at Court in a Suit of <HI>Engli&s;h
Broad Cloth,</HI> and cloth'd all his Servants in
the &s;ame; and tho' his Liveries were plain,
they were hand&s;omer and richer than any
in that Country.</P>
<P>It happen'd however, after &s;ome time,
Divi&s;ions prevailing there as well as in
other Courts, that he began to be in
le&s;s Repute with &s;ome People than be|fore,
yet he &s;till went on as well as Cir|cum&s;tances
would admit, in his own
way, (<HI>viz.</HI>) of encouraging Trade; he
receiv'd all the Equipages of his Servants
and Furniture of his Hou&s;es from <HI>Eng|land:</HI>
Notwith&s;tanding the fine Brocades
and rich Silks which are made in <HI>France,</HI>
he cloathed his Counte&s;s, and the young
Ladies his Daughters, and their Atten|dants
in rich <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Silks, fine Mu&s;|lins,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> bought in <HI>England,</HI> and brought
from the <HI>Indies</HI> by the <HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Company.</P>
<P>Upon building his fine Country-Seat
of TARIFF-CASTLE, in <HI>France,</HI>
all the fine Locks and Keys, and &s;everal
other parts of the Furniture came from
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<HI>England;</HI> the Roof was cover'd with Lead
to di&s;tingui&s;h his Re&s;pect for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Commerce, and all the Ve&s;&s;els and Uten|&s;ils
of his Family, which it was proper to
have &s;o, were of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pewter.</P>
<P>This particular Conduct of the Count,
with re&s;pect to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, gave
&s;ome Umbrage in <HI>France;</HI> and whether
it were by the Artifice of &s;ome of his
Neighbours, who always envy'd and
rivall'd the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> or whether it was
meerly the Inclination of the People there
to &s;et up Manufactures of their own, Au|thors
are not agreed about it; but it pro|cured
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> many Enemies at home,
as is before ob&s;erv'd; nay, even his own
Tenants and Neighbours complain'd that
he favour'd Foreigners and foreign Ma|nufactures,
alledging that his Coaches
were lined with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> CLOTH, his
Rooms hang'd with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> STUFFS,
that all his Servants &s;moaked TOBACCO,
and other Circum&s;tances falling in with
this at the &s;ame time, the <HI>Count</HI> was
oblig'd to alter his Mea&s;ures, and fir&s;t
declined &s;ome part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade
by &s;everal publick Acts, as particularly
on the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> 1665. the 20th
of <HI>December,</HI> 1687. and at la&s;t he was
obliged wholly to renounce it on the 7th
<PB N="8" REF="7">
of <HI>September,</HI> 1701. Upon the&s;e Di&s;tur|bances
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> being nece&s;&s;itated, as
above&s;aid, to lay a&s;ide all Corre&s;pon|dence
with his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Friends; they, on
the other hand, acted the weake&s;t part
that ever was known among Trading Men
and Merchants; for however he had
been their Friend, and however ab&s;ur'd,
it was on their &s;ide to forbid the Expor|tation
of their own Manufactures; yet
they took that &s;imple Step, and without
re&s;pect to Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> or the Injury
they did to their own Workmen in the
Countries, and their Families, truly,
they cut off their own Trade, and would
not &s;uffer any more Broad-Cloth, or Ser|ges,
Stuffs, Bays, Ker&s;ies, Dozens, or
any Woollen Manufactures, or other
Goods, to be &s;ent to Count <HI>Tariff;</HI> by
which piece of Wi&s;dom they lo&s;t their
Country, the Exportation of above Six
hundred thou&s;and Pounds a Year, in Goods
of their own Growth or Manufactures;
be&s;ides tho&s;e of the Growth and Pro|duce
of their Plantations and other Coun|tries.</P>
<P>Count
<HI>Tariff</HI> being treated thus by his
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Friends, it was not to be wondred
if Mynheer <HI>Coopman&s;chap,</HI> an old Car|rier,
and a cunning, tricking, circum|venting,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
&s;harping <HI>Dutch</HI> Broker, fell in
with him: This <HI>Coopman&s;chap</HI> was a great
Dealer in the Manufactures and Produce
of other Countries, but had very few or
none at all of his own: He drove indeed
a great Trade to mo&s;t parts of the World:
It was he who made that famous Voy|age
to <HI>Japan,</HI> where when he was asked
by the Emperour, whether he was a
<HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> or not, he an&s;wer'd, he was a
a HOLLANDER: He had been all
over the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and particularly was
Governour at <HI>Amboyna</HI> upon a certain
Butcherly occa&s;ion, which <HI>Authors &s;ay</HI> is
nothing to the purpo&s;e now, becau&s;e it
was a great while ago: He has driven
a great Trade ever &s;ince by Interloping
into the Trade of other Nations, but is
e&s;pecially remarkable for keeping his Word
no longer than he finds it for his Gain,
and then complaining that others DO
SO: It was not many Years before this,
that he was in Partner&s;hip with a great
<HI>German</HI> Merchant, one Mynheer <HI>Leopol|dus</HI>
of <HI>Vienna;</HI> in which they had agreed
not to lay down their Trade but by mu|tual
Con&s;ent, and particularly old <HI>Coop|man&s;chap</HI>
bound him&s;elf, not to contract
any Partner&s;hip without the Con&s;ent of
<HI>Leopoldus,</HI> and without taking him in;
<PB N="10" REF="9">
but he broke his Word, and left old <HI>Leo|poldus</HI>
in the Lurch before the Voyage
was half fini&s;h'd; which is mention'd
for their Service, who pretend to &s;ay he
was injured lately <HI>that may</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was not ignorant of the
Subtilty and Knavery of this Tricking
<HI>Dutchman,</HI> for he had heard his Character,
and had dealt with him before; but his
Circum&s;tances requiring him to &s;ettle a
Corre&s;pondence <HI>&s;ome where,</HI> and having
been ill u&s;ed where he inclined to &s;ettle,
he found it for his Advantage to engage
with <HI>Mynheer;</HI> and accordingly Articles
of Partner&s;hip were &s;ign'd between them
on the 7th of <HI>December,</HI> 1699.</P>
<P>It was no &s;mall Surprize to the re&s;t of
the Trading Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> that Count
<HI>Tariff</HI> had &s;ettled with <HI>Mynheer;</HI> and tho'
it had been better for them all, that he
had continu'd to Trade with the whole
World on equal Terms, as before; yet
when they found that could not be,
they would all have been glad to have
had him exclu&s;ively to them&s;elves; but
old <HI>Coopman&s;chap,</HI> according to Cu&s;tom,
was too cunning for them all, and
knowing the Worth of the <HI>Count,</HI> he
&s;upplanted all the World, and got him to
him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
One of the principal Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of <HI>Myn|heer,</HI>
after he had &s;ecur'd Count <HI>Tariff</HI> to
him&s;elf, was to prevent his Trading with
any Body el&s;e; and fain he would have
had the Count have entered into &s;ome ex|clu&s;ive
Terms with him, which at fir&s;t
he could not obtain, it being not inclu|ded
in their Articles; but it fell in af|terwards
upon the occa&s;ion of &s;ome of
his old Corre&s;pondents prohibiting their
Factors to &s;end him any Woollen Manu|factures,
<HI>as afore&s;aid.</HI></P>
<P>No &s;ooner had old <HI>Coopman&s;chap</HI> and
the Count engaged, but the <HI>Dutchman</HI>
began to in&s;ult all Count <HI>Tariff</HI>'s old
Corre&s;pondents, and put the Dice upon
all that Traded with him before; for
no Body could Trade with Count <HI>Tariff</HI>
at all NOW, but they mu&s;t pay
TOLL to old <HI>Coopman&s;chap,</HI> no Goods
could be &s;ent to Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> but in old
<HI>Coopman&s;chap</HI>'s Waggons and Ships, &s;o that
he became the general <HI>Carryer</HI> to all the
Trade of that &s;ide of the World, and
got &s;omething by every thing that <HI>other
People</HI> dealt in.</P>
<P>This made him &s;o In&s;olent, that if
any Propo&s;als of Peace or Trade were
made to him, his An&s;wer was always,
Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> Count <HI>Tariff, ick vil hab
<PB N="12" REF="11">
Count Tariff,</HI> nothing mu&s;t be done with|out
Count <HI>Tariff.</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t <HI>Mynheer</HI> thinking he had effec|tually
&s;ecured all the Trade of the World,
and that he was able to keep every Body
el&s;e out of it; truly he began to u&s;e
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> him&s;elf very &s;curvily, and
on &s;everal Occa&s;ions abu&s;ed him very
gro&s;ly; in&s;omuch that <HI>the Count</HI> who ea|&s;ily
&s;aw him&s;elf maltreated, grew weary
of him: He found that this <HI>Coopman&s;chap</HI>
was but a Jobber of other Peoples Trade,
a meer <HI>Pedlar,</HI> a <HI>Waggoner,</HI> or <HI>Carrier</HI> for
other Merchants; that all the Goods he
(Count <HI>Tariff</HI>) bought of him, were
brought to him at <HI>Second Hand,</HI> and that
he might much better have them direct|ly
from the Makers and Manufacturers,
and the Countries where they were pro|duced:
Wherefore he (Count <HI>Tariff.</HI>)
re&s;olved at la&s;t, to put an end to it; and
accordingly, he wrote him a very plain
Letter, telling him what a cozening old
Knave he had been, how rich he was
grown by means of the Partner&s;hip, and
yet how ba&s;ely he had treated his Part|ner&punc;
and in &s;hort told him in &s;o many
Words at the end of his Letter, that
he would have no more to do with
him.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
It is not to be wondred if <HI>Mynheer</HI>
was Thunder-&s;truck at this &s;urprizing
Letter; for by it, on a &s;udden, he lo&s;t
all tho&s;e Advantages which had for &s;ome
time rai&s;ed up both his Pur&s;e and his
Pride; and which had enabled him to
hold up his Head, and think him&s;elf e|qual
with the riche&s;t Merchant in <HI>Eu|rope.</HI>
But from this Di&s;appointment he
began to alter his Tone, and talk a lit|tle
humbler than he was wont to do;
mean time he omitted nothing to recover
his former Intere&s;t in Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> and
if po&s;&s;ible, to retrieve the Partner&s;hip;
and to that purpo&s;e, he di&s;patched two
of his Factors to go to Count <HI>Tariff</HI>'s
Hou&s;e, and to try if they could by any
Offers, Submi&s;&s;ions, and Promi&s;es, and on
any Conditions what&s;oever, retrieve this
Blow; that he might pre&s;erve his govern|ing
Influence on the Trade of <HI>Europe:</HI>
But after &s;everal vain Attempts of this na|ture,
<HI>he found</HI> that it was impracticable,
and that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was re&s;olved, <HI>for
his &s;ake,</HI> that he would never more engage
in a &s;eparate Partner&s;hip; but that he
had rea&s;&s;umed his former generous Prin|ciple,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) of <HI>encouraging univer&s;al Com|merce,</HI>
a thing that did not &s;uit with
Mynheer's De&s;igns at all; who always
<PB N="14" REF="13">
advanced him&s;elf by encroaching on
other Mens Trade, rather than by car|rying
on any particular Trade of his own;
as is evident by his Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI>
which he rifled a great <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
Merchant of; his <HI>Herring Fi&s;hery,</HI> which
he got by Encroachment on the Scots
Merchants, and by his Trade to the <HI>Bra|zils</HI>
and <HI>Surinam,</HI> which he &s;tole from the
<HI>Spaniards;</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>But Mynheer, who never u&s;ed to give
a Game over while he had any Cards
left in his hand to play, when he found
he could not get Count <HI>Tariff</HI> to him|&s;elf;
his next Concern was to take care
that the Count &s;hould not engage with
any body el&s;e; and particularly, he was
&s;en&s;ible it would be a very great Lo&s;s
to him if any Engli&s;h Merchants &s;hould
embark with him: It &s;eems he had had
&s;ome private Intimation, that Count <HI>Ta|riff</HI>
was about making a new Partner|&s;hip
with one Mr. <HI>Traffick,</HI> an eminent
Merchant and Alderman of <HI>London.</HI>
This Mr. <HI>Traffick</HI> traded, it &s;eems, in
Company with one <HI>Harry Woolpack,</HI> a fa|mous
Clothier in the We&s;t; and toge|ther,
they two manag'd the whole Trade
of the Woollen Manufacturers on that
&s;ide of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
It was a mortal Blow to Mynheer,
to think that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> &s;hould en|gage
with the&s;e People, and it put him
into a cold Sweat immediately; for the&s;e
were the very Men that he had bubbled
for &s;o many Years pa&s;t; for having kept
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> under his Thumb, he got
all the Trade into his own Hand, made
tho&s;e Engli&s;h Merchants glad to &s;ell their
Woollen Manufactures to him, &s;ome <HI>fi|ni&s;h'd,</HI>
&s;ome <HI>unfini&s;h'd,</HI> as he plea&s;ed to
take them, and at <HI>what Price</HI> he plea&s;ed
to give for them; &s;o that they only fur|ni&s;h'd
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> at &s;econd-hand, and
old <HI>Coopman&s;chap</HI> got the Profit.</P>
<P>All the while he did thus he wheed|led
Mr. Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> and <HI>Harry
Woolpack</HI> with fine Stories of his being
their only Friend; of his taking off &s;uch
va&s;t Quantities of their Manufactures
more than other Nations; nay &s;ometimes
he would &s;ay more than all the Nations
of the World; and, that no body could
do this but he; <HI>whereas the Truth was,</HI>
that all this while he was only the <HI>Mid|dleman,</HI>
or Broker, between both; for
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was really the Man who
procured mo&s;t of the Trade, and made
the great Con&s;umption of the Woollen
Manufactures by encouraging the wear|ing
<PB N="16" REF="15">
thereof, as afore&s;aid, among his Te|nants
and Servants: and this &s;ubtle Dutch|man
had only been a Pick-pocket on
both Sides. As &s;oon as Mr. <HI>Traffick</HI> and
<HI>Harry Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lpack,</HI> and their other Partners,
came to under&s;tand this, it gave them a
mo&s;t contemptible Opinion of old <HI>Coop|man
&s;chap,</HI> and made them reflect with
great Regret on tho&s;e Councils which
had led them into &s;uch a Noo&s;e, and cau|&s;ed
them to be &s;o dup'd, and made Fools
of, by this old Dutch Man for &s;o many
Years, to the Ruin of their Trade, and
the enriching of him and his Hangers
on: When their Eyes were thus open|ed,
and they &s;aw clearly how they had
been play'd upon and cozen'd, they enter|tained
with great Readine&s;s the Propo&s;als
of <HI>a new Partner&s;hip</HI> with Count <HI>Tariff,</HI>
which the Count, by his Agents, had of|fered
them about that time.</P>
<P>Upon this, the Treaty of Partner&s;hip
between Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> and the Count,
having gone on with great Sincerity and
Application on both &s;ides, it was conclu|ded
and &s;igned between Arbitrators em|ployed
by both Parties on the 31&s;t of
<HI>March</HI> 1712. tho' this was not brought
to pa&s;s without a mighty Oppo&s;ition of old
<HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">opman&s;chap</HI> and his Friends.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
It was thought at fir&s;t, that the Treaty
having been thus fini&s;hed, and all Par|ties
being thus agreed, there could not
have been any room for a Mi&s;carriage
after that; and it was not doubted but
Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Traffick and Company</HI> would have
driven a gallant Trade the next Year
with Count <HI>Tariff;</HI> but it proved quite
otherwi&s;e, by the Subtilty and indefati|gable
Cunning and Diligence of that old
Fox <HI>Coopman&s;chap;</HI> the Particulars of who&s;e
Intrigues make the next part of our
Story.</P>
<P>Old <HI>Coopman&s;chap</HI> having been alarmed,
as is &s;aid already, by the Report of a
Treaty being &s;et on foot between Count
<HI>Tariff</HI> on one hand, and the &s;aid Mr. Al|derman
<HI>Traffick</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and his Part|ners
in the Country, <HI>on the other hand;</HI>
he found there was no time to be lo&s;t;
for the&s;e, as afore&s;aid, were the greate&s;t
Dealers in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Woollen Manu|factures
that were in the World; and
the very &s;ame Men who he had bought
all the Woollen Goods of, which he had
&s;upplied Count <HI>Tariff</HI> with, during their
late Partner&s;hip; he knew al&s;o if the
Count &s;ell in with them, he &s;hould not
only be circumvented and become u&s;ele&s;s
in the Trade, but that all his Cunning
<PB N="18" REF="17">
and Knavery would be expo&s;ed on either
Hand; That fir&s;t Count <HI>Tariff</HI> would &s;ee
how he had made him pay thro' the No&s;e
for every thing which he had bought,
and that he could buy cheaper of Alder|man
<HI>Traffick</HI> and Company; and not on|ly
&s;o, but the Alderman and his Partners
would di&s;cover al&s;o, how when he had
beaten down the Price, and brought them
to &s;ell their Goods &s;o mon&s;trous cheap,
that their poor Workmen could hardly
get Bread by their Labour, he &s;old tho&s;e
Goods at the &s;ame time for a great Price to
Count <HI>Tariff;</HI> and &s;o he had gotten the
Profit of all the Trade to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He was con&s;cious that when both Sides
came thus to &s;ee into his Knavery, they
would equally re&s;ent his former Corre|&s;pondence
with them, and never have
any thing to do with him in that re&s;pect
again; that by this means he &s;hould lo&s;e his
Cullies, and be quite &s;tript of the Ad|vantage
he had always made by them.</P>
<P>Upon this and many other Mi&s;chiefs
which he fore&s;aw would follow, he re|&s;olved
to go over for <HI>England,</HI> and by
all means po&s;&s;ible, endeavour to prevent

He was encouraged to make this At|tempt
by a &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence, which
he always held in that Country with a
certain CLUB or Society of Men, who
having certain private wicked Projects of
their own to carry on by his A&s;&s;i&s;tance,
were declared Enemies to Count <HI>Tariff</HI>
for his &s;ake; and by con&s;equence would
be &s;ure, right or wrong, to oppo&s;e the
new Partner&s;hip Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was making
with their Fellow-Citizens, however it
might be to the prejudice of their Coun|try
or of them&s;elves; Envy and Revenge
being the mo&s;t Self-denying Vices in the
World. The&s;e People pretended indeed
to be very great Friends to Alderman
<HI>Traffick</HI> and <HI>Henry Woollpack</HI> his Partner,
yet they had given &s;everal &s;ufficient Te|&s;timonies

them both for the Intere&s;t of old

<HEAD>Here follows an Account of the Speech which
Mynheer VAN COOPMANSCHAP made
at his fir&s;t Appearance in the Club.</HEAD>
<P>FIr&s;t, He gave them thanks for the
great Services they had done him
upon all Occa&s;ions in time pa&s;t, and the
great Obligations which they had laid
upon him; <HI>for That,</HI> not regarding their
Country, their Liberty, their pre&s;ent
Advantages, or their Po&s;terity, they had,
with a &s;teady and un&s;haken Zeal, al|ways
preferred his <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> to THEIR
OWN.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
He acknowledged, that in a former
Partner&s;hip, wherein they had been en|gaged
with him, they never in&s;i&s;ted up|on
his paying in the Proportions of
STOCK agreed upon between them;
But had very kindly carried on <HI>their own
Part,</HI> and mo&s;t of <HI>his too,</HI> tho' at the
&s;ame time they were fain to run them|&s;elves
into heavy Debts, <HI>more than ever
they were like to have paid,</HI> be&s;ides &s;everal
other Inconveniencies to <HI>do</HI> it; and al&s;o
altho' the <HI>greate&s;t part</HI> of the Profit of
the Partner&s;hip fell to HIS SHARE; all
which, he told them, added to the Ge|nero&s;ity
of their Treatment of him, and
which therefore obliged him to this
grateful Remembrance thereof.</P>
<P>He owned, and <HI>therewith he made them
a Grimace,</HI> that they had been very
Friendly to him, in not examining his
Accounts relating to the &s;aid Partner|&s;hip,
but had pa&s;&s;ed them upon <HI>his Credit,</HI>
which he (being utterly unable to make
a fair Account) was very much obliged
to them for.</P>
<P>He could not forget, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> how
frankly they had furni&s;hed the greate&s;t
part of the Ships employed in their Part|ner&s;hip,
even without charging him for
his &s;hare of the Freight, whereby he
<PB N="22" REF="21">
had been at lei&s;ure to carry on the
<HI>North-Seas-Trade,</HI> which was quite out
of the Partner&s;hip, at their Expence; and
which had encouraged him to charge
even tho&s;e Ships al&s;o which were em|ployed
in the &s;aid &s;eparate Trade to the
<HI>North-Seas,</HI> as if employed in the &s;aid
Partner&s;hip, to his un&s;peakable Advan|tage;
for which he &s;aid he was infi|nitely
obliged to them.</P>
<P>That whereas they had been equally
concerned for &s;everal Years pa&s;t, in car|rying
on an Undertaking for the French
PHILOSOPHERS STONE, which
as it had been both hazardous and ex|pen&s;ive,
&s;o it had been owned to be,
<HI>as &s;uch Projects generally are,</HI> very unlike|ly
to &s;ucceed, e&s;pecially to the height that
&s;ome propo&s;ed; he told them he thought
him&s;elf obliged to confe&s;s, that they
had generou&s;ly &s;upplied more Workmen
for the &s;aid Undertaking than they were
bound to furni&s;h by their Agreement,
and yet had not made him pay toward
the extraordinary Charge of it. It is
true&punc; <HI>&s;aid</HI> he, you once propo&s;ed to me,
that in Con&s;ideration thereof, I &s;hould
break my Partner&s;hip with Count <HI>Ta|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">,</HI>
and have no more to do with him;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, upon my repre&s;enting to
<PB N="23" REF="22">
you faithfully how much it would be
to my Prejudice tho' to your Advan|tage,
you were &s;o kind as not to in&s;i&s;t
upon it; which I acknowledge, <HI>&s;aid he,
and made them a Dutch Bow,</HI> was a great
In&s;tance of <HI>Self-denial</HI> in you, and di&s;in|tere&s;ted
Friend&s;hip to me.</P>
<P>But <HI>he told them</HI> he had yet greater
things than tho&s;e to thank them for,
and particularly, that <HI>bold Step</HI> they took
on his Account, and which few Partners
but they would have ventur'd at, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
That when &s;everal of his principal Corre|&s;pondents
in <HI>England</HI> were in danger of
being turned out of their Shops and
Employments by their LANDLADY,
the Club had appeared &s;o much intere&s;t|ed
in their Behalf, as to depute &s;ome of
their RUDEST Members to Her, to
tell her <HI>very re&s;pectfully,</HI> that &s;he ought
not to do &s;o; that &s;he ought to have
con&s;ulted them in the Management of
her Servants and Family; that if &s;he
ventur'd to do it, &s;he would entirely
lo&s;e their Favour, and did not &s;tick to
threaten her, <HI>tho' &s;he was their own Land|lady</HI>
too, that in &s;uch ca&s;e they would
&s;hew their Re&s;entment, and would nei|ther
give her or her Tenants, or her
Workmen, Credit for one Farthing of
<PB N="24" REF="23">
Mony, nor &s;uffer any body el&s;e to do
it, nay nor pay her their Rent neither,
if they could help it; which Threatning,
tho' it did not &s;ucceed according to Ex|pectation,
yet was &s;uch an extraordina|ry
Step in his Favour, as he could not
but think him&s;elf very much obliged to
them for it.</P>
<P>He told them farther, that he was
particularly obliged to thank them for
another In&s;tance of their Zeal for his
Intere&s;t, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that when &s;ome Briti&s;h
Merchants came over to a Place called
<HI>&V;trecht,</HI> a City in his Country, in order
to recover a certain Branch of Trade
out of his Hands which he had circum|vented
them of before, the Society had
endeavoured to expo&s;e and ruin tho&s;e
Merchants, loudly declaring in all their
Societies, as well <HI>Grecian</HI> as <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that
it was neither ju&s;t nor hone&s;t to take
any thing away from Mynheer <HI>Van
Coopman&s;chap,</HI> or to get any thing for
Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> and Company, with|out
letting him have an equal Share
of it, <HI>or, in &s;hort,</HI> to di&s;oblige him in any
re&s;pect what&s;oever: So that they ju&s;ti|fied
him highly in the Practice of what
every one knew was his Principle, <HI>viz.</HI>
That what every one el&s;e got &s;hould
<PB N="25" REF="24">
be part of it his, and what he him&s;elf
got &s;hould be all his own.</P>
<P><HI>He thank'd them,</HI> he &s;aid, that in their
late famous Voyage or Adventure to
<HI>Terra</HI> (Gertrudenburg) <HI>Incognita,</HI> in
which they had been al&s;o Partners, yet
the Club had generou&s;ly left the Ma|nagement
of the whole Voyage to him,
owning them&s;elves not fit to be tru&s;ted
in Affairs (tho' their own) of &s;o nice
a nature; by which, had not his un|happy
native Avarice prompted him to
gra&s;p the Shadow and let &s;lip the Sub|&s;tance,
he might have made a very good
Voyage for him&s;elf, at the Expence of
all the re&s;t of his Partners; but as he
had no body to blame for the Mi&s;car|riage
but him&s;elf, &s;o he thank'd them
for their Good-will, whatever Lo&s;s he
&s;u&s;tain'd by the Voyage.</P>
<P>It was true, he &s;aid, that another
Mi&s;carriage of his had been the Effect
of their Advice to him, (<HI>viz.</HI>) when
they per&s;waded him to adhere to the
Executors of old <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> and preferr
his German-Partner&s;hip to all other En|gagements;
which piece of Council
overthrew the whole Voyage; for as <HI>on
the one hand</HI> he &s;lip'd a good Opportu|nity,
and refu&s;ed an advantageous Of|fer
<PB N="26" REF="25">
of another Partner&s;hip, which he
inclined to embark in; and which, had
he clo&s;ed with it, would have preven|ted
the di&s;mal Events that followed:
So, <HI>on the other hand,</HI> he not only was
di&s;appointed in all his chimerical Hopes
of that Voyage, but had all his Ve&s;&s;els
plundered, his Goods and Merchandizes
taken away, and mo&s;t of his Agents
and Servants were knock'd on the Head,
and thrown over-board, or carried into
Slavery; which forced him, at la&s;t,
&s;hamefully to quit the &s;aid <HI>German Part|ner&s;hip,</HI>
and to lo&s;e all tho&s;e Advantages
that had been offered him at fir&s;t, as
afore&s;aid; however, he &s;aid, as he be|lieved
the Society did it for the be&s;t,
and had only acted by him as they did
for them&s;elves, and according to their
kown Politicks, (viz.) <HI>Never to know
when they are well,</HI> &s;o he could not blame
them in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>He acknowledged, that their general
Conduct had been always with an Eye
to his Intere&s;t and Grandeur, which
they had given him &s;o many Te&s;timo|nies
of that it was very much to his
Satisfiction, and which he had &s;o far
depended upon, as had made him talk
in a different Tone from what he u&s;ed
<PB N="27" REF="26">
to do, to &s;everal of his other Partners;
for that he knew they were always rea|dy
to back him in and approve of all
the Mea&s;ures he took for advancing his
own Trade: and that they were always,
willing to &s;ink their own Stocks, and
throw away their own E&s;tates, rather
than he &s;hould be a Sufferer.</P>
<P>He told them al&s;o, that he thankfully
remembred how they had given him
timely notice, when they de&s;igned to
ruin the Publick Credit, if it had been
in their Power, that he might have &s;uf|ficient
time to draw out his Mony;
whereas had their De&s;ign &s;ucceeded, he
might, without &s;uch notice, have been
a very great Lo&s;er.</P>
<P>It was true, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he had ob&s;erved
that altho' they had informed him that
their <HI>Landlady</HI> was a Bankrupt, and her
Credit broke, and per&s;waded him not
to lend her Mony; yet, as &s;oon as &s;he
had offered them a &s;mall Advantage in
the Loan, they all run in privately, and
lent their own Mony, leaving him out:
But as this was nothing but what he
taught them, and as he would have
done by them if it had been in his
Power, he was not at all di&s;obliged by
it, knowing they would make him amends
for it many other ways.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27">
He told them, he was in a particu|lar
manner obliged to them in other
Affairs of their Partner&s;hip, e&s;pecially
for drawing up proper Memorials for
him upon certain Occa&s;ions, in which
they were &s;o zealou, for his Intere&s;t,
and &s;o willing to make him popular,
that they had frequently ventur'd to
Print them before they had been deli|vered;
and if at any time his &s;ecret
Management had been di&s;covered, and
the People began to entertain a mean
Opinion of his Hone&s;ty, they always
had employed their whole Set of Pam|phleteers
to vindicate him, who had
covered the foule&s;t of his Actions with
the mo&s;t popular Lyes they could in|vent;
of which they were very fruit|ful,
and by an infinite number of Abu|&s;es,
Invectives, and Libels, even again&s;t
<HI>their Landlady herself,</HI> and all her Fami|ly,
and Servants, they had diverted the
Rage of the People, and impos'd upon
them in &s;uch a manner, that his Cha|racter,
which was much in Danger by
&s;ome Mi&s;takes he had fallen into, &s;tood
very right again with the People; and
as he had maintained a kind of Corre|&s;pondence,
<HI>from the Teeth outward only,</HI>
with their <HI>Landlady,</HI> which however he
<PB N="29" REF="28">
was alwas ready to break off when their
Intere&s;t &s;hould require it, he had there|by
he hop'd kept him&s;elf in a Condition
to requite the Favours he had received
from them.</P>
<P>That for his part, he &s;aid, tho' he
&s;hould not boa&s;t of his Merit, yet he
hoped he had not been wanting on all
Occa&s;ions to &s;hew his re&s;pect to them,
and to lay all the Obligations upon
them which it was in his Power to do.
That upon all Occa&s;ions he had &s;upported
them in their private De&s;igns and Con|trivances
again&s;t their <HI>Landlady</HI> and her
Adherents, Family, and Servants; that
he had acquie&s;ced in all the Memorials
they had drawn up for him, and been
as well &s;atisfied with them when they
were drawn up at the farther End of
<HI>Piccadilly,</HI> as when they were done at
<HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> which al&s;o had &s;aved him a
great deal of Trouble; and tho' in one of
tho&s;e Memorials they had committed a
fatal Mi&s;take, in acknowledging the Fact
which it was intended to deny, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
about his having not &s;upplyed the Quota
of Ships to the Partner&s;hip which he
had agreed to furni&s;h, yet he was very
well &s;atisfied with the Invention they
found out to cover it, whether it were
Truth of Fact or no.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">
He mode&s;tly put them in mind of
his great Concern for them in another
Affair, wherein he had made him&s;elf
Arbitrator for the Succe&s;&s;ion of their
Trade in the next Age; and pre&s;erving
a Partner&s;hip, which it was agreed
&s;hould be entered into, after a certain
Engagement was expired, with &s;ome
Merchants of <HI>Brun&s;wick;</HI> which tho' they
all knew there was not the lea&s;t need
of, that it was in it &s;elf nothing at
all, that Contract being effectually
&s;ecured by the Circum&s;tances and na|ture
of the thing; yet as it was of u&s;e
to them otherways, and &s;erved to make
the Reputation of the Club &s;well among
&s;ome People, &s;o he had done it to &s;erve
them; at the &s;ame time taking &s;uch effec|tual
Care to pre&s;erve their Trade in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI>
by &s;ecuring it all into his own
Hands, that he hoped it was to their
exceeding great Satisfaction: He put
them in mind how for their &s;akes he
had continued his Partner&s;hip with the
Executors of old <HI>Leopolaus</HI> Merchant of
<HI>Vienna,</HI> altho' Count <HI>Tariff</HI> had made
him very great Offers to break the
&s;ame; and altho' he had met with very
great Lo&s;&s;es in carrying it on, and altho'
one Merchant <HI>Eugene,</HI> who was Factor
<PB N="31" REF="30">
for the &s;aid Partner&s;hip, had impo&s;ed up|on
him, and out&s;tood his Market, having
been outwitted by Count <HI>Tariff</HI>'s Fac|tors,
and &s;o had &s;poiled the whole Voy|age,
as he had ju&s;t now told them.</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;ured them in the next place, that
as he had &s;erved them with all his <HI>u&s;ual</HI>
Sincerity in the&s;e and many other occa&s;i|ons;
&s;o he was &s;till ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;tand
by them in their private Concerns, and
to renew the Partner&s;hip they had carried
on &s;o long, and which they had &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sfully
been engaged in, for as many
Years as they &s;hould think fit; that e&s;|pecially
he was ready to &s;upport them
and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in any Mea&s;ures which
they &s;hould think proper again&s;t their
Landlady, whether to expo&s;e, ridicule,
and affront her Per&s;on and the Manage|ment
of her Family and Hou&s;hold, or
to oppo&s;e any of her De&s;igns, however
laudable and u&s;eful for the good of her
Tenants; (at which words the A&s;&s;embly,
in token of Gratitude, and accepting the
Offer, &s;tood all up) and Mynheer ma|king
another <HI>Dutch</HI> Bow went on&mdash;</P>
<P>He told them, that he was &s;till very
ready to &s;ettle Matters of Trade for
this part of the World, if they would
but &s;tick fa&s;t to their old Maxims of lea|ving
<PB N="32" REF="31">
it all to him, and being willing that
his Intere&s;t &s;hould be &s;ecured fir&s;t and
then their own brought in as &s;ub&s;ervi|ent;
and finally, he profe&s;t him&s;elf ready
to require their Kindne&s;s at all times,
if he might but enjoy the Benefit of
their Trade, exclu&s;ive of them&s;elves, <HI>as
he had d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ne.</HI></P>
<P>He then came to the main Point: He
told them, that he under&s;tood there
was a private Clande&s;tine Negociation
on foot between Merchant <HI>Traffick</HI> of
<HI>London,</HI> and his Partner <HI>Henry Woolpack</HI> of
the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> for a Partner&s;hip with Count
<HI>Tariff</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> the Articles whereof, if
they came to be <HI>made Effectual,</HI> would be
very prejudicial to his Affairs, and that
therefore he de&s;ired their utmo&s;t A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
again&s;t is: He told them, that
this Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was always Partner
with him, and had left him without
warning, that it would di&s;able him
from driving his Trade, and con&s;equent|ly
from buying &s;o many Woollen Ma|nufactures
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> as he u&s;ed to do becau&s;e
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> would take them here him|&s;elf,
and, in &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">rt he told them that
if they had any Re&s;pect for him, or
expected any of his A&s;&s;i&s;tance in their
other &s;ecret Affair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, which he had al|ways
<PB N="33" REF="32">
been their Friend in, they mu&s;t
&s;tand his Friend at this time, and pre|vent
the Articles of this Partner&s;hip from
being MADE EFFECTUAL.</P>
<P>Then he fell to railing at Count
<HI>Tariff,</HI> told them he was a <HI>Frenchman</HI>
and a <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> and a tricking fal&s;e Fel|low
that never kept his word with any
Body, that he was a Bankrupt, and not
able to make good what he had pro|mi&s;ed,
that he would crowd them with
his own Goods, &s;uch as Wine, Brandy,
Silk, Linnen, Paper, &amp;c. but would
take little or nothing of them in re|turn,
only give them large Promi&s;es
and good Words, with which he would
feed them till the Partner&s;hip was &s;et|tled
and made effectual, and then he
would laugh at them; and with much
more of this kind he ended his Speech.</P>

his <HI>German</HI> Partner would ruin him|&s;elf,
by following the precipitant Mea|&s;ures
of his &s;aid Factor Merchant <HI>Eu|gene,</HI>
e&s;pecially in carrying on that Trade,
which was too hazardous and expen&s;ive
for <HI>his</HI> Strength of Stock; and that it
was rumoured already upon Change,
that his Bills had been prote&s;ted in di|vers
parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;o that it was
feared we &s;hould quickly hear there was
a Commi&s;&s;ion of Bankrupt taken out
again&s;t him, and that he would make a
Compo&s;ition with his Creditors.'</P>
<P>'He told him, tho' the Society had
been di&s;appointed in every thing they
had undertaken for him, and were at
this time but in mean Circum&s;tances;
their Character declining, their Repu|tation
very low, and mo&s;t of their valu|able
Men gone off from them to the
Intere&s;t of their <HI>Landlady,</HI> having by
her Advice joined in a new Partner&s;hip
with Merchant <HI>Moderation,</HI> an old and
known Enemy to the whole Society,
yet as their Spirit (<HI>Malice</HI>) was not in
<PB N="37" REF="36">
the lea&s;t abated, and that they had yet
Members enough left to make a great
Effort (Noi&s;e) in his Favour, &s;o he
might depend upon their utmo&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
in every thing what&s;oever that
he de&s;ired; in return whereof, they
hoped <HI>Mynheer</HI> would continue to be
their con&s;tant Friend and Corre&s;pon|dent
in the &s;ame manner as he had
done before; adding, that they had one
farther Reque&s;t to make to him, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
That whereas they might probably find
it needful &s;ometimes, in carrying on
his Intrigues, or their own; to make
them&s;elves obnoxious to the Law, and
which was likely to be very frequent,
to fly from Ju&s;tice, run away from Bail,
and <HI>&s;uch like,</HI> he would engage to re|ceive
their Criminals, and make them
Burge&s;&s;es in his Cities and free Denizens,
Naturalizing them among the Servants
of his Family, as would be mo&s;t &s;ui|table
to them, and to him al&s;o, whe|ther
they were felonious-Bankrupts,
Murtherers of Nobility, Duellers, Scots
Libellers, Traytors, or what kind of Of|fenders
&s;oever.'</P>
<P>'That as to the new Treaty of Part|ner&s;hip
with Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> he told him
there was no doubt but the Club would

e&s;pou&s;e his Cau&s;e, <HI>right</HI> or <HI>wrong,</HI> again&s;t
that <HI>Frenchman</HI> and all his Attempts;
that the name of <HI>French</HI> would make it
exceeding Popular, and they would pre|&s;ently
&s;pread it over the whole Nation,
that he was a Pick-pocket, a Conjurer,
and dealt with the Devil, and they
doubted not to have him Mobb'd if he
came hither.'</P>
<P>'He <HI>told him,</HI> that as to Alderman <HI>Traf|fick,</HI>
he knew he was an eminent Dealer,
and under&s;tood Trade, and perhaps he
might be &s;teady as to his old Notions of
the Liberty of Trade; but as for ho|ne&s;t
<HI>Woolpack</HI> he knew him well enough,
that he was a well-meaning Country-Fellow,
but very Pa&s;&s;ionate, and
Ignorant, and he did not que&s;tion but
the Club would find means to Impo&s;e
upon his Judgment, by telling him a
hundred Stories and Shams of this
<HI>Frenchman Count Tariff;</HI> and if they
did but once make him believe that
<HI>Count Tariff</HI> would take off none of his
Manufactures, he would go &s;tark Mad,
and break off the new Partner&s;hip at
once, or quarrel with Alderman <HI>Traf|fick</HI>
his Partner, and refu&s;e to go on
with the Trade; concluding upon the
whole, in the Name of the Society,
<PB N="39" REF="38">
that he might depend upon it, they
were all <HI>Mynheers</HI> hearty Friends more
than their own.'</P></Q>
<P>The Chairman having ended his Speech,
a Tool of his who &s;at at his Elbow, lately
turned Malecontent becau&s;e he was left
out of a certain Commi&s;&s;ion, made a mo|tion
to the Club, that they &s;hould declare
their A&s;&s;ent to all that Sir <HI>Pol</HI> had &s;aid,
which was done, the following Minute
being extracted out of the Journal of the
Club.</P>
<Q>Re&s;olved, Nemine Contradicente,</Q>
<P>That the Thanks of the Club be given
to Sir <HI>Pol Fal&s;hood</HI> the Chairman, for his
excellent Speech to Mynheer <HI>van Coop|man&s;chap.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Pol</HI> having gone thus far, proceeded
then to put the <HI>grand Que&s;tion,</HI> which was
al&s;o carried, as follows.</P>
<Q>Re&s;olved, Nemine Contradicente,</Q>
<P>That this Club will &s;tand by, a&s;&s;i&s;t,
and &s;upport <HI>Mynheer van Coopman&s;chap,</HI>
their old and con&s;tant Partner, Confede|rate
and Ally, with all their Art and
Skill, not only again&s;t <HI>Count Tariff</HI> and
Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> but again&s;t all the <HI>Harry
Woolpacks</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and again&s;t all other
Oppo&s;ers what&s;oever, <HI>Landlady</HI> and all.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39">
This Vote being pa&s;t, Sir <HI>Pol</HI> &s;tood up and
made another Speech, and directed him|&s;elf
then to the <HI>Club, Mynheer</HI> being with|drawn,
in which he &s;poke with a great
deal of Heat, and with all that Sen&s;e and
Pa&s;&s;ion he u&s;ed to &s;peak with el&s;ewhere.</P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>'He told them, that having heard
what had been &s;aid by <HI>Mynheer van Coop|man&s;chap,</HI>
and what return had been
made to him, he expected no other, but
that they would Re&s;olve to a&s;&s;i&s;t and
&s;tand by him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as they had done;
and that now having thus entered upon
the thing, the next and immediate Step
was, that they &s;hould con&s;ider of <HI>Ways</HI>
and <HI>Means,</HI> to put in execution what
they had Re&s;olved on; that no time was
to be lo&s;t; that they expected every Po&s;t
to hear that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was come over,
and that the Articles of Partner&s;hip be|tween
him and Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> &amp;c.
would pre&s;ently be Ratifyed, and a Law
pa&s;s to make them EFFECTUAL,
and that then all was lo&s;t, and their fa&s;t
Friend <HI>Coopman&s;chap</HI> would be ruined.'</P>
<P>'Then he run out in the prai&s;e of <HI>Myn|heer,</HI>
how nece&s;&s;ary it was to them to
Support him, how they could never
hope to carry on their &s;ecret De&s;igns
<PB N="41" REF="40">
again&s;t the <HI>Landlady,</HI> if they lo&s;t <HI>Mynheer,</HI>
and that all their Trade (juggling) which
they had carried on &s;o long with <HI>Mynheer
van Coopman&s;chap</HI> would be &s;poiled, if
they did not prevent it ju&s;t now.'</P>
<P>'<HI>Then he fell foul upon Count Tariff,</HI> you
have heard his Character, &s;aid he, from
<HI>Mynheer van Coopman&s;chap</HI>'s own Mouth,
what a Tricking, Cozening, Bankrupt
Fellow he is, and what a Trade we are
like to have with him, if this Partner|&s;hip
&s;hould proceed; and therefore, <HI>con|tinued
Sir Pol,</HI> my good Friends, I would
not have you be deceived by tho&s;e who
talk of your having a great Trade with
him; It is all a Cheat: How &s;hould
he want any of your Manufactures when
he can make them all him&s;elf by his own
Tenants and Servants whom he has
lately &s;et up, and given great Encou|ragement
to them out of his own E&s;tate?
and as to the defect of Wooll, which
they pretend to &s;ay will prevent this,
that is effectually An&s;wered by the News
which came to me by the la&s;t Po&s;t, and
which I thought fit to communicate to
you, that it may by your Diligence and
Corre&s;pondence in the Country, be
&s;pread about among the Woollen Manu|facturers
and Clothiers of <HI>Britain, (viz.</HI>)
<PB N="42" REF="41">
That this Count <HI>Tariff</HI> has found out a
new Invention not only to &s;upply his
own Tenants and Servants with good
Woollen Manufactures, but that in a
little time he would be able to &s;upply
the whole World with Woollen Manu|factures,
even <HI>Britain</HI> and all; for that
by this new Invention, they could make
FINE Manufactures of COARSE Wooll,
and he was told of another new Project
&s;etting up ju&s;t now among them of making
all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures in <HI>France with|out
any Wooll AT ALL,</HI> which, if they
&s;hould bring to Perfection, <HI>as he feared
they would,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade would be
quite ruined, and the <HI>French</HI> Tenants of
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> would Under&s;ell them at
all the Markets in <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;o that he
doubted not but <HI>the Club</HI> would be con|vinced
that it was their own Intere&s;t as
well as his, to prevent Count <HI>Tariff</HI> en|tering
into any Mea&s;ures here.'</P></Q>
<P>The Club were mightily affected with
this part of Sir <HI>Pol</HI>'s Speech, and the Noi&s;e
interrupted him for &s;ome time; they ap|peared
in a great Con&s;ternation, as well
they might, at the mention of &s;uch a Pro|ject
being &s;et on foot in <HI>France,</HI> for making
<HI>Broad-Cloth, Sarges,</HI> &amp;c. WITHOUT
<PB N="43" REF="42">
WOOLL, and a wi&s;e Senator of the Club
wrs ob&s;erved to &s;hake his Head, and with
a deep Sigh to &s;end forth this Ejaculation,
LAURD! &s;aid he, <HI>What will become of
poor</HI> England! <HI>This will ruin us all with a
Witne&s;s!</HI> What! <HI>The</HI> French <HI>Manufactures</HI>
without Wooll! good lack! <HI>This is the ef|fect
of making Peace with the</HI> French! <HI>This
is a</HI> French <HI>Popi&s;h Project indeed! I'll war|rant
the</HI> New Mini&s;try <HI>have a Hand in
it! We &s;hall be all undone! alas! poor</HI>
England.</P>
<P>There was a general Murmur thro
the whole Society on this &s;urprizing In|formation,
in&s;omuch that the Hou&s;e &s;eem|ed
in &s;ome Commotion, and Sir <HI>Pol</HI> could
not yet proceed; but the wi&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions
which on that Occa&s;ion dropt from &s;undry
Members of the Society being yet re&s;erved
in Whi&s;pers only; Hi&s;tory has made men|tion
of no more than what is hinted above,
which Silence has been a &s;en&s;ible lo&s;s to

the many weighty Sentences dropt on that
Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, the Club being a lit|tle
recovered, Sir <HI>Pol</HI> rea&s;&s;umed his for|mer
Di&s;cour&s;e, and went on to lay down
his Mea&s;ures, which, <HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> he would
have them take to pro&s;ecute this De&s;ign,

<Q REND="inline"><P>'He told them he had been with <HI>Al|derman

with Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> the great Quantities
of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures he was formerly
accu&s;tomed to take off, and would now
again take off of our Hands; but &s;aid
Sir <HI>Pol,</HI> I will confute them all by one
piece of Conduct of mine, for &s;ince <HI>Al|derman

we mu&s;t overpower him, and run him
down by our Numbers and Noi&s;e; for
this end, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary

<P>Sir <HI>Poll</HI> received &s;everal Humms, and
other Te&s;timonies of Applau&s;e, from the
Club, as he went on with this; by which
they &s;ignified their full Approbation of
<PB N="46" REF="45">
every thing he &s;aid to them; which en|couraged
him to proceed as follows.</P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>'<HI>He told them,</HI> the breaking of <HI>Harry
Wooll-pack</HI> from his Engagements with
Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> was, <HI>tho' in it &s;elf a
Trifle,</HI> of very great Con&s;equence to
many other of their De&s;igns, as well as
this of Count <HI>Tariff;</HI> for it would im|mediately
affect all the People of <HI>Bri|tain;</HI>
it would alarm all the Manufa|cturers,
and make them believe their
Trade was to be lo&s;t and undone, and
that they &s;hould be ruined; it will
make, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> all the Clothing Towns
write up to their Repre&s;entatives, and
per&s;wade them that all is at &s;take, and
that they'll CHOOSE them NO
MORE, if they do not take care about
it in Parliament: nay, <HI>&s;ays Sir Poll in
&s;ome Extacy,</HI> it is not to be imagined
how far we may run this Thought; I
que&s;tion not, <HI>&s;rys he,</HI> but we &s;hall make
it a <HI>DOCTOR SACHEVERELL</HI> to us,
and perhaps may make as good u&s;e of
it for our purpo&s;e, as was made by
other People of that Affair of Dr. <HI>Sache|verell</HI>'s,
which it is evident was impro|ved
to a quite contrary purpo&s;e to what
it was de&s;igned for; and as the former
part &s;aid he will be ea&s;ily managed by
<PB N="47" REF="46">
our A&s;&s;i&s;tants at the places before named,
&s;o we can never want a Detachment of

Coffee-hou&s;e, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the latter, and
make a Tumult for us if there be occa|&s;ion.'</P>
<P>'Our Bu&s;ine&s;s then, <HI>continued he,</HI> is to
rai&s;e <HI>Harry Wool pack</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;ions, for he
is naturally a hot-headed Fellow, and
as furious and incon&s;iderate <HI>as my &s;elf</HI>
when he is moved; and when we have
&s;crew'd him up to a pitch, he'll make
<HI>&s;uch a Noi&s;e,</HI> no body <HI>el&s;e</HI> &s;hall be heard
all over the Kingdom but he: be&s;ides,
he has a prodigious Intere&s;t in the
Country; as well <HI>Landed-men</HI> and <HI>Tra|ding-men,</HI>
as <HI>Monied-men,</HI> they are all of
his &s;ide; and if once he rai&s;es his Voice,
he can call a &s;trange multitude about
him: There's <HI>Sergius Perpetuanus</HI> the

with an hundred thou&s;and <HI>Devon|&s;hire-men,</HI>

who are all &s;uch Dependants upon this
<HI>Wooll-pack,</HI> that if he does but hold up
his Finger, they are at his Beck; &s;o
that, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> the Sum of this Matter
is to per&s;wade <HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> to break
this Bargain, and to fright him with
the Apprehen&s;ions of lo&s;ing all his
Trade. Let us get but this done then,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and we need not value <HI>Old Traf|fick;</HI>
for if he in&s;i&s;ts upon it never &s;o
much, if <HI>Wool-pack</HI> does not come in,
it can never go on, or be made EFFE|CTUAL.'</P>
<P>'It follows next, &s;ays <HI>Sir Pol,</HI> that we
con&s;ider of the Methods to bring this
to pa&s;s; and the only way to do this,
<HI>as I &s;aid before,</HI> is to be&s;patter Count
<HI>Tariff,</HI> and heap up all the Scandal we
can upon him, by which we &s;hall make
him frightful and odious to <HI>Wooll-pack</HI>
and his Friends; and if he &s;hould ven|ture
after this to come over hither, to
get the Articles of his new Partner&s;hip
made EFFECTUAL, we'll bring <HI>Har|ry
Wooll-pack</HI> in, as Plaintiff, get him In|dicted
<PB N="49" REF="48">
for a Cheat, and a Pick-pocket,
and have him Tried for his Life.</P></Q>
<P>This Speech was too full of Gall, Party-Rage,
and particular Malice, not to &s;uit
well and be very acceptable to the whole
A&s;&s;embly; for Temper and Moderation
was long ago hi&s;s'd out of the Club, as
an Enemy to the Being and Nature of
their Con&s;titution; like a Coward, who
is Troop'd out of a Camp by <HI>Beat of

<P>Being then &s;ufficiently prepared by this
Plan of their Proceedings, laid down by
<HI>Sir Poll,</HI> they fell to work immediately,
and fir&s;t they voted that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was
a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and therefore let the Gain
of the Partner&s;hip be what it would, we
had better be without him. This was
voted with &s;uch a Clamour in the Club,
that nothing could be heard for a great
while but the repeated Cry of No <HI>French

<Q REND="inline"><P>'The la&s;t Word &s;tartled a certain

<P>But the Vote pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>as above,</HI> with too
much Noi&s;e for any thing of Rea&s;on

<P>So it was carried by a great Majority;

<HI>which was accordingly done.</HI></P>
<P>The 11 Members who were voted ex|pell'd,
de&s;ired to explain them&s;elves; but
a Scots Pamphleteer, <HI>&s;ince fled from Ju&s;tice,</HI>
&s;tood up, <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> the Tories condemned
a Peer to lo&s;e his Head, in his Country,
for offering an Explanation to a publick
Act: and he was &s;ure tho&s;e 11 Members
were Tories in Di&s;gui&s;e; for &s;ure none
but a Tory would Trade with a <HI>French|man;</HI>
and therefore he was for farther
Pro&s;ecution again&s;t them: <HI>&V;pon which</HI> the
11 withdrew, for fear of &s;ome of his
Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The next Que&s;tion was, <HI>What Religion
Count</HI> Tariff <HI>was of?</HI> This produced a hi|deous
Cry, of a <HI>Papi&s;h,</HI> a <HI>Papi&s;h,</HI> a <HI>Papi&s;h!</HI>
no Trade with a <HI>Papi&s;h!</HI> no Trade with

round the Club-Room, like a Vote in the
Common-Hall when a Sheriff is put up
from the Hu&s;tings, which is u&s;ually a
Quarter of an Hour a &s;ounding.</P>
<P>After many Debates of this nature, <HI>it

as long as he dur&s;t &s;tay for fear of

daily Libels, circular Letters, and &s;curri|lous

had their Authors and Printers of the So|ciety
always in Pay: and they gave them
<PB N="53" REF="52">
a general Order, not to &s;tick at any thing,
&s;o it would but blacken Count <HI>Tariff</HI> and
Alderman <HI>Traffick;</HI> nor to &s;tick at any

<HI>Thames-&s;treet</HI> was taken up for it, which
terrified the disbanded Officer afore&s;aid,

them more careful of their Tongues.</P>
<P>In the mean time Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI>
who&s;e Genius was turned for Trade, and
who under&s;tood it better than Sir <HI>Pol,</HI> or
any of them, being convinc'd that the

and that it was calculated for
the general Good, not of him&s;elf only,

none of them, but to go on &s;teadily in
his De&s;ign of making the Partner&s;hip
EFFECTUAL.</P>
<P>But the Alderman knowing what &s;ort
of People he had to do with and what
he was to expect from them afterwards;
that he might leave them without Excu&s;e,
re&s;olved to have their own Te&s;timonials

his Intention of entering into Partner&s;hip
with Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> and asking their Opini|on
of the &s;ame, whether they thought it
might be for the Publick Advantage or
no; particularly and expre&s;ly de&s;iring
them, if they had any Objections to make,
or any thing to propo&s;e for their own Ad|vantage
in the &s;aid Trade and Partner|&s;hip
with Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> that they would
&s;end up their &s;aid Reque&s;ts and Objecti|ons
<PB N="55" REF="54">
before the Partner&s;hip was conclu|ded,
and particularly their Opinions as
to the Trade it &s;elf, after it &s;hould be
agreed, whether it was for the Publick

<P>In An&s;wer to this, <HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> in
particular, and all the re&s;t al&s;o, however
they have been mi&s;guided &s;ince, &s;ent up
long Memorials and Repre&s;entations, ex|pre&s;&s;ing
their full Satisfaction in the &s;aid
Partner&s;hip, and propo&s;ing &s;uch and &s;uch
Alterations and Additions as they thought
nece&s;&s;ary to be provided again&s;t, altered
or added; upon doing whereof, <HI>they all</HI>
gave it under their hands, that the &s;aid
<HI>Partner&s;hip</HI> would be very advantageous
to them, and that a Trade with Count
<HI>Tariff</HI> had been <HI>before,</HI> and would be <HI>again,</HI>
with &s;uch Regulations, a very beneficial
Trade to them and all their Neighbours:
Which Memorials and Repre&s;entations,
under their Hands, are yet to be produ|ced
to their Faces, when occa&s;ion re|quires.</P>
<P>As
Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> was thus confirm|ed
in his Opinion of the Goodne&s;s of
his De&s;ign, not only by his own Judgment,
but by the &s;aid Memorials and Repre|&s;entations
of <HI>Harry Woollpack,</HI> and all his
Friends, he gave Count <HI>Tariff</HI> an Invita|tion
<PB N="56" REF="55">
to come over to <HI>England,</HI> in order to
have the Partner&s;hip con&s;ummated, and
the Articles MADE EFFECTUAL,
who accordingly arrived here the 31&s;t
Day of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, being the &s;ame Day
that Sir <HI>Pol</HI> laid the Plan in the Club for
his De&s;truction, as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the <HI>Count</HI> arrived, but the
Club began to put their Mea&s;ures, <HI>which they
had re&s;olved on,</HI> in Execution: And FIRST,
In order to make the Affair of the &s;aid
Partner&s;hip a <HI>Party-Cau&s;e,</HI> they railed at
him as a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and cau&s;ed a Report
to be &s;pread all over the Kingdom, that
he had brought the <HI>Pretender</HI> with him,
and particularly they took care to make
<HI>Harry Woollpack</HI> really believe it; which
was the fir&s;t beginning of the Breach on
that Side.</P>
<P>The poor <HI>Count,</HI> who never knew what
<HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> meant, and was of no Party,
but for the Univer&s;al Good of Mankind,
was &s;urprized to hear them call him a <HI>Ja|cobite,</HI>
and askt, <HI>What Trade that was?</HI>
<Q REND="inline">'He told them, he never concerned him|&s;elf
with Government, it was his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
always to &s;ubmit to the legal E&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of the Country he was in,
to pay Cu&s;toms and Duties chearfully,
and not only to augment the Revenues
<PB N="57" REF="56">
of the Princes who Reigned, but to a&s;|&s;i&s;t
and enable their People to pay chear|fully
and willingly whatever the Laws
obliged them to; that it was his con|&s;tant
Cu&s;tom to acknowledge the Power,
but never concerned him&s;elf about the
Per&s;ons Reigning, much le&s;s about tho&s;e
who &s;hould or &s;hould not &s;ucceed;
and that for being a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> he knew
nothing of it.'</Q></P>
<P>But let the <HI>Count</HI> &s;ay what he would,
it was to no purpo&s;e, Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and his
Club had Voted it, and the Cry was gone
out into the Country, that Count <HI>Tariff</HI>
was come over with the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dor,
and had brought over the <HI>Pretender,</HI>
nay, and that he was actually lodged in
<HI>Somer&s;et-hou&s;e:</HI> The De&s;ign of this was to
have the <HI>Count</HI> Mobb'd and torn to pieces
in the Street; <HI>or el&s;e,</HI> which would an|&s;wer
<HI>Mynheer Coopman&s;chap</HI>'s end better,
that he &s;hould be terrified with the Ap|prehen&s;ions
of it, and &s;hould be obliged
to retire with him to <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>But they were di&s;appointed in the fir&s;t
part of their Project, for the <HI>Count</HI> ha|ving
given Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> full Satis|faction,
that he was a Person wholly con|cerned
in Matters of Trade, and in them
only; and that he de&s;ired to have no
<PB N="58" REF="57">
other Bu&s;ine&s;, here; the <HI>Alderman</HI> pro|tected
him from the Mob, and from the
fury of Sir <HI>Pol,</HI> and al&s;o cleared up his
Character, as to <HI>Jacobiti&s;m,</HI> well enough.</P>
<P>The Party then finding them&s;elves un|able
to hurt the <HI>Count</HI> this way, apply
them&s;elves to their OTHER METHOD,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) To attack his Character, as to
Trade; and here indeed they met with
better Succe&s;s, tho' it was by the help
of the mo&s;t &s;candalous Methods, and the
unju&s;t Practices in the World, as will
appear in the &s;equel of our Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>To enter into the better De&s;cription of
the&s;e things, we mu&s;t go back to the
<HI>Club,</HI> and to Sir <HI>Pol</HI> their Director: Sir
<HI>Pol,</HI> who is naturally Cholerick, and abo|minably
revengeful, having been heated
with the Di&s;appointment he had received,
<HI>as above,</HI> and not being able to get the
<HI>Count</HI> Mobb'd for a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and for
bringing over the <HI>Pretender;</HI> he called <HI>a
Club</HI> on a <HI>Saturday</HI> Night late, and co|ming
into the A&s;&s;embly in a great Pa&s;&s;ion,
told them, the Alderman had ba&s;ely enter|tained
Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> by Authority; and that
he believed that even the LANDLADY
her &s;elf was a <HI>Jacobite;</HI> and he did not
que&s;tion but the <HI>Pretender</HI> might have
been found hid under Count <HI>Tariff</HI>'s Cloak,
<PB N="59" REF="58">
or was pack'd up in his Equipage, if
the Officers might have &s;earched him;
whereas Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> had forbidden
them to Affront him; but that he had
been even both with the <HI>Alderman</HI> and
the <HI>Landlady</HI> too for that, and had ta|ken
Care they &s;hould be both Expo&s;ed
for it over the whole Nation; and upon
this he called for the <HI>Scots</HI> Pampleeter
who pulled out two Printed Ballads,
which, he &s;aid, would do their Bu&s;ine&s;s;
one was <HI>The Merchant Alamode;</HI> the other
<HI>The Amba&s;&s;adre&s;&s;es Speech,</HI> which he gave
about to the whole Club, and ordered
Copies to be di&s;tributed to <HI>Harry Wooll|pack</HI>
and his Friends, by the Printer to the
Society.</P>
<P><HI>It was true,</HI> that tho&s;e Wicked Mea|&s;ures
of Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and his Fraternity, did
a little &s;tagger <HI>Harry Woollpack</HI> and his
Friends, &s;o that they began to decline the
Partner&s;hip which Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> had
made, and &s;ent up Letters and Addre&s;&s;es to
the <HI>Alderman,</HI> not to go on with it; and
made &s;ome Clamours again&s;t making it
EFFECTUAL, as &s;hall be &s;hewn in its
place; which Proceedings occa&s;ioned &s;ome
delay in the Matter at fir&s;t, but their Eyes
were &s;oon opened, and they were all
convinced of their Mi&s;take at la&s;t; and
<PB N="60" REF="59">
tho' 'tis true it was too late to retrieve
the fir&s;t Damages of the thing, yet it
taught them to know Sir <HI>Pol</HI> a little bet|ter
than they did before, and to have a
care of him accordingly; which tended,
in the end, to the Effectual &s;ettling the
Affair. But to return to Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and the
Club.</P>
<P>The Club received his la&s;t Harangue
with great Satisfaction, and were more
e&s;pecially diverted with the Ballads; for
any thing that affronted their <HI>Landlady</HI>
was always agreeable to the Club: But
their Mirth was almo&s;t &s;poiled by an un|lucky
Motion, made by one of their own
Body, <HI>tho' Innocently,</HI> for he was as much a
well-wi&s;her to Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and to his Country's
di&s;order, as any of them, but was not
let into the whole Secrets of Management,
and did not know that the Work was to
be done <HI>Per fas</HI> aut <HI>Ne fas:</HI> This grave
Citizen was a <HI>Warehou&s;eman</HI> by Occupa|tion,
and therefore mightily concerned
for the Woollen Manufacture, tho' Hi&s;tory
has not recorded his Name: This Man
&s;tanding up in his place, told the Chair|man
that he approved very well of what
Sir <HI>Pol</HI> had propo&s;ed, as to defaming and
blackning Count <HI>Tariff</HI> and his Adherents,
to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Harry Woolpack</HI> and his Friends
<PB N="61" REF="60">
again&s;t the propo&s;ed Partner&s;hip, and to
rai&s;e the Mob upon <HI>Count Tariff;</HI> only,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'I think it would be nece&s;&s;ary to
get a certain eminent old Citizen,
whom I was formerly acquainted with,
on our Side, in all we do of this Na|ture;
one, &s;ays he, you have all heard
of, for he fined for Alderman in the time
of Sir <HI>William Turner,</HI> was well ac|quainted
with the <HI>French</HI> Trade; and
might be a match for old Alderman
<HI>Traffick,</HI> or any of them, and this is old
Merchant FACT; for, <HI>continues he,</HI> the
Reputation of this old Gentleman is
&s;uch, that no Body will que&s;tion what
we &s;ay, if he is on our Side; and on the
other hand, if Count <HI>Tariff</HI> &s;hould get
him <HI>from us,</HI> it will put us to a very
great <HI>Nonplus.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>Upon this Motion Sir <HI>Pol</HI> &s;tood up, and
fir&s;t looking about to &s;ee if the Door
was &s;hut, and none of the Drawers in
the Room, <Q REND="inline">'GENTLEMEN, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>
what Deputy &hellip;&hellip;.. has propo&s;ed
is very good, and would be to the Pur|po&s;e,
and I have been trying &s;ome time
to get this old Gentleman on our Side;
but I mu&s;t tell you <HI>in Confidence,</HI> that he
is gone out of the way, and <HI>I fear</HI> is
gone over to the Enemy, or at lea&s;t
<PB N="62" REF="61">
has withdrawn him&s;elf; whereupon,
having &s;eriou&s;ly bethought my &s;elf, I
have found out two Expedients in order
to &s;upply his Place.'</Q></P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>'1. Says he, I own 'tis ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to make <HI>Harry Woolpack</HI> and his
People believe that Merchant FACT
is really on our Side; and therefore I
have re&s;olved to take that part upon
my &s;elf, and &s;et up a Counterfeit Mer|chant
FACT in his room, which I will
&s;how to the Mob, as I find occa&s;ion:
nay, rather than fail, &s;ays Sir <HI>Pol,</HI> I'll
counterfeit Merchant FACT my &s;elf;
indeed I mu&s;t be concealed from tho&s;e
People's View who are well acquainted
with his Countenance, or with his Mind;
but as to <HI>Harry Woollpack</HI> he will take
any thing we &s;ay to him upon Tru&s;t;
and we have nothing to do, as to him,
but to &s;ay we have got Merchant FACT
on our Side, and he will pre&s;ently cry
out of all that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> and his
Friends can &s;ay, that <HI>it is all Lyes,</HI> and
therefore, if you plea&s;e, leave this to my
Management; it is but putting a good
Face to it: I make no que&s;tion, but
we &s;hall carry it as well, as if we had
Merchant FACT along with us, for
Noi&s;e and Fal&s;hood, at this time of
<PB N="63" REF="62">
Day, will with good Management go
as far as Fact and Truth can do.'</P>
<P>'2. To carry on this Di&s;gui&s;e with the
greater certainty of Succe&s;s, continues
he, I have found out an excellent A&s;|&s;i&s;tant,
and one that &s;tood a fa&s;t Friend
to me, in former Days, when the Citi|zens
our Ance&s;tors had ju&s;t &s;uch another
Game to play upon King <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>This A&s;&s;i&s;tant, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> has mi&s;led the
City the&s;e thirty Years with &s;uch Dex|terity
and &s;uch admirable Succe&s;s, that
no Body has di&s;covered or detected him
yet, having thirteen or fourteen Hands
of the principal Merchants of <HI>London,</HI>
to a Certificate of his Integrity in the
Year 1674; the&s;e he drew in at that
time, without any enquiry, to Vouch
for him, taking all he &s;aid upon Tru&s;t:
And that I may hold you in &s;u&s;pence
no longer, this is the famous SCHEME
OF TRADE brought up with old
<HI>Whi&s;ton,</HI> the Devil's Broker, and as ac|curate
a Lvar as ever his Ma&s;ter was.'</P></Q>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly received this Propo&s;al of
Sir <HI>Pol</HI>'s with a general Approbation, and
recommended to him the nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;|patch:
In the mean time, Count <HI>Tariff</HI>
began to appear abroad again, and Al|derman
<HI>Traffick</HI> declared that he had en|tered
<PB N="64" REF="63">
into Partner&s;hip with him, and
that he had re&s;olved to apply to the <HI>Land|lady</HI>
to have the Articles of the &s;aid Part|ner&s;hip
MADE EFFECTUAL by Law.</P>
<P>Now was Sir <HI>Pol</HI> to play his Game, or
never, for Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> pu&s;hed on
his De&s;ign to a Hearing, before &s;uch Judges
as the LANDLADY had directed it to
be laid before; wherefore, <HI>in the Fir&s;t
place,</HI> Sir <HI>Pol</HI> attacks him with publick
Defamation, <HI>as was agreed before,</HI> and
&s;pread a thou&s;and Clande&s;tine Stories
about of his Behaviour; as that he was
Clande&s;tinely run away from his Part|ners
abroad, that he had broke his
word there, and never kept his Arti|cles
with any Body; &s;o that there was
no depending upon any thing he &s;aid;
that he was a Bankrupt, and had not
paid his Debts, and therefore it was not
&s;afe to enter into any Treaty of Part|ner&s;hip
with him; that he pretended
to come hither for Trade, and to buy
a great many Woollen Manufactures,
but that his De&s;ign was of another kind;
that he was no Friend to Trade at all,
but a meer <HI>Papi&s;h,</HI> and a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and
had a De&s;ign to bring in the <HI>Pretender;</HI>
that he intended not to buy any of
our Manufactures, and was &s;o far from
<PB N="65" REF="64">
wanting Woollen Manufactures at
home, that he was the Inventor and
Encourager of that new Invention among
his own Tenants, of making <HI>fine</HI> Goods
of <HI>coar&s;e</HI> Wooll, as above&s;aid; and of
making &s;undry Woollen Manufactures
without any Wooll AT ALL; in
which he had made a very con&s;iderable
Progre&s;s; now tho' among Merchants,
this way of Defaming a Man, is very
Barbarous and Infamous al&s;o, yet Count
<HI>Tariff</HI> bore it without any Concern, and
went on with his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Pol,</HI> and his Party, then finding
this would not do neither, and that <HI>Count
Tariff</HI>'s Reputation was &s;o clear, that if
they did not find out &s;ome other way to
Ruin him, he would not carry his Point;
they re&s;olved to &s;pring their <HI>la&s;t Mine,</HI>
and blow him up at once; to this pur|po&s;e
OLD SCHEME, the Fellow men|tioned
before; who, <HI>as above,</HI> had lived
&s;everal Years by Cheating, and Counter|feiting
Names, making fal&s;e Accounts,
forming Ab&s;tracts of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e
Books, <HI>and the like,</HI> is brought out to act
his part upon Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> to get him
Indicted for a Cheat, and &s;o they re&s;ol|ved
to bring him to a Tryal. This old
<HI>Knight of the Po&s;t</HI> having his Le&s;&s;on given
<PB N="66" REF="65">
him, alledged, that the <HI>Count</HI> came hi|ther
to &s;ell his Goods for ready Mony,
and carry it away in Specie, contrary to
the Act of Parliament in that Ca&s;e made
and provided; that he had Contracted to
turn OWLER, and carry away our Wooll
<HI>&V;nmanufactured</HI> into <HI>France;</HI> that all the
Accounts given by Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> of the
large Commi&s;&s;ions the <HI>Count</HI> had brought
from <HI>France,</HI> for buying <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wooll|en
Manufactures, was a meer Cheat;
that he had 25 Ships already upon the
Coa&s;t loaden with Wine and Brandy,
which mu&s;t be all paid for in Mony, the
Bills being drawn already, and accepted;
that he was in a Plot to introduce the
French Wines to be the common Draught,
in&s;tead of <HI>neat-Port,</HI> contrary to the In|clination
of our <HI>Soveraign Lord the Peo|ple;</HI>
and to poi&s;on us all with <HI>French</HI> Brandy;
our own Malt Spirits being known to be
much whol&s;omer.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and many other heinous Crimes,
being laid to Count <HI>Tariff</HI>'s Charge
by this &s;uborner old SCHEME,
they pu&s;hed on the Proce&s;s, and got
Count TARIFF arraigned for a Cheat,
in the Name, and at the Suit of <HI>Henry
Woollpack</HI> and Company; tho' without
their actual Con&s;ent too.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="66">
The <HI>Count,</HI> who knew his own Inno|cence,
did not que&s;tion but in &s;uch a
Religious Nation as this was fam'd to be,
he &s;hould have Ju&s;tice done him; and
therefore tho' he might have pleaded <HI>to
the Juri&s;diction of the Court,</HI> as having
entered into a Partner&s;hip, which tho&s;e
who contracted it with him, were <HI>un|doubtedly
impowered</HI> by their own <HI>Natural
Right</HI> to engage in; and that without
giving an Account to any Body; <HI>and
tho' al&s;o</HI> he might have pleaded the Law
of Nations for Protection; yet waving
all the&s;e things, he frankly offered him|&s;elf
to the Court, and de&s;ired to be
brought <HI>to Tryal,</HI> which accordingly was
done.</P>
<P>Upon his Tryal, the u&s;ual Forms ha|ving
pa&s;&s;ed, and <HI>the Charge</HI> being read,
the fir&s;t thing that gave the Court &s;ome
Diver&s;ion, was the detecting Sir <HI>Pol;</HI>
for he had Di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf, and appeared
in Court under the Name of MER|CHANT
FACT; but as he was per&s;o|nating

<PB N="68" REF="67">
off,</HI> this made him be more &s;trictly ob|&s;erved,
and &s;ome Per&s;ons in Court, who
formerly had &s;ome Acquaintance with the
real Merchant FACT, &s;poke openly,
and offered to prove that this was not the
Man; upon which all the hone&s;t Peo|ple
that &s;tood by, hi&s;&s;ed at him mo&s;t
intolerably; and if ever he could have
Blu&s;hed in his Life, it was thought it
would have been at this time.</P>
<P>Tho' he found him&s;elf thus detected, yet
wanting no A&s;&s;urance, he turned it off with
a ready &s;hift, that indeed he was not Mer|chant
FACT of <HI>London,</HI> but he was Good|man
FACT of <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> and he ho|ped,
he &s;aid, that if he was a true FACT,
the Difference of City-Fact or Country-FACT
would not be much.</P>
<P>The Court allowed that in his favour,
and then put him to the proof of what
he had &s;aid, for which he appealed all
along to his FACT-OR old <HI>Scheme.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Charge being read, and all
Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and his Voucher <HI>old Scheme</HI> had to
&s;ay, being heard with the utmo&s;t patience
by the Court; Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was allowed
to &s;peak for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He &s;poke with great Mode&s;ty of him|&s;elf:
He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'That he was no Cheat,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ words"> and had no Evil De&s;ign; that he had
<PB N="69" REF="68">
always been a Friend to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Commerce, and that he had been &s;u&s;|pected
in his own Country on that Ac|count;
that he came to re&s;ide here
for the Benefit of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> that he
could have had very advantageous Con|ditions,
if he would have joined with
<HI>Mynheer van Coopman&s;chap,</HI> and never have
come here at all; and that he could &s;till
be very well received, if he would en|gage
with him, in&s;tead of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Merchants; that he was &s;o far from
being in Debt abroad, that on the
contrary, <HI>Mynheer van Coopman&s;chap</HI> owed
him twenty Millions of Guilders, and
he was ready to prove it by his Books;
but that he feared very much he &s;hould
never get his Money.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'<HI>He told them,</HI> that con&s;idering how
well it was known, that he came hi|ther
with no other Intent but purely
to do the Nation Service, and that the
<HI>Dutch</HI> might not run away with their
Trade; he was &s;urprized that he &s;hould
meet with &s;uch Treatment: That he
expected better U&s;age; that he had
been promi&s;ed he &s;hould be Amicably
received when he came hither, and
that by &s;ome who <HI>he &s;aw</HI> appeared very
warm again&s;t him now, and who he
<PB N="70" REF="69">
took for Men of more Honour.'</Q> This
Reflected upon <HI>Harry Woollpack</HI> and his
Friends who indeed began to be a&s;ha|med
of Sir <HI>Pol,</HI> and to &s;neak away one
by one.</P>
<P><HI>He went on</HI> to Complain, <Q REND="inline">'That the
Witne&s;&s;es who appeared again&s;t him
were &s;candalous Fellows; that Mer|chant
<HI>Fact</HI> was per&s;onated indeed, but it
was a Counterfeit; for Merchant FACT
was his old Acquaintance and Corre|&s;pondent,
and he knew him very well;
he was a <HI>middle &s;ized</HI> FAIR <HI>Gentleman,</HI>
of an hone&s;t Countenance, and a calm
compo&s;ed Temper: But as to that tall,
black, pa&s;&s;ionate, hangman look'd Fellow,
who called him&s;elf Merchant FACT, he
was not in the lea&s;t like him; and he much
wondered, he &s;aid, that any Court of
Ju&s;tice &s;hould admit <HI>counterfeit</HI> FACTS
for <HI>true,</HI> e&s;pecially after they were &s;o
openly Detected.'</Q></P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>'Then, a to OLD SCHEME, <HI>he
&s;aid,</HI> he was an Up&s;tart that indeed he
had not heard of before, but upon hear|ing
his Evidence, he would undertake
to prove upon the &s;pot, that he was
guilty of <HI>Lying</HI> and <HI>Counterfeiting,</HI> and
that he had practi&s;ed tho&s;e things ever
<PB N="71" REF="70">
&s;ince the Year 1674. and he de&s;ired he
might call his Witne&s;&s;es to this.'</P></Q>
<P>The Court was very much moved at
this Di&s;cour&s;e, and readily gave the
<HI>Count</HI> leave to call his Witne&s;&s;es, which
made every Body believe that he would
carry his Cau&s;e, and indeed Sir <HI>Pol</HI>'s
Friends began to de&s;pair for him; for
the <HI>Count</HI> in the fir&s;t place produced a
whole Cart-load of Books, Draughts, Ac|counts,
and other Papers from the Cu|&s;tom-hou&s;e,
with the proper Officers at|tending,
to Vouch their being Authen|tick,
and the Commi&s;&s;ioners Hands to
them; upon Examining whereof, it ap|peared
that OLD SCHEME had really
drawn fal&s;e Accounts, counterfeited the
Names who he had pretended had at|te&s;ted
them, and that none of all the
Accounts he had produced, agreed with
the Originals in the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e
Books; from whence he pretended he had
copied them.</P>
<P>This cau&s;ed the Court very much to
re&s;ent the U&s;age they had met with from
the old Knave, and &s;ome Authors affirm,
that it was moved he &s;hould be expo&s;ed,
and his Accounts burnt by the Hangman;
but the turn that afterwards happened to
<PB N="72" REF="71">
the&s;e things, &s;aved him from receiving his
ju&s;t Reward <HI>at that time.</HI></P>
<P>This put Sir <HI>Pol</HI>'s Party into a great
Con&s;ternation: But Sir <HI>Pol,</HI> who never
was at a lo&s;s, produced in the next place,
a great Number of Petitions from Coun|try
and City, <HI>the fir&s;t</HI> procured by the
two <HI>Blackwell-Hall</HI> Factors, formerly men|tioned:
The&s;e had &s;ent blank Petitions of
their own drawing up, to <HI>Harry Wooll|pack</HI>'s
Friends all over <HI>England,</HI> telling the
Country Clothiers by Letters, that if they
did not Sign them they were undone; and
their Trade would be all given away to
<HI>France; the la&s;t</HI> was from the Weavers
and Companies in <HI>London,</HI> procured by
the &s;ame Sollicitation, and mo&s;t of the &s;aid
la&s;t Petitions having the &s;ame Hands to
them all.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the&s;e, Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> in be|half
of Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> produced a Multi|tude
of Repre&s;entations from all parts
of <HI>England</HI> to him&s;elf, being the &s;ame
formerly mentioned, entreating him
to invite Count <HI>Tariff</HI> over hither, and to
engage in Partner&s;hip with him; expre&s;|&s;ing
their great Satisfaction, and how ad|vantageous
it would be to the Nation, if
he could be prevailed upon to become
Partner with <HI>Harry Woolpack</HI> and him&s;elf,
<PB N="73" REF="72">
as afore&s;aid; repre&s;enting al&s;o what an
advantageous Trade <HI>Great-Britain</HI> enjoyed
formerly, when the old real Merchant
FACT, and the <HI>Count</HI> corre&s;ponded to|gether:
And that which was mo&s;t &s;ur|prizing
in this part of the <HI>Count</HI>'s Defence
was, that many of the&s;e Petitions and
Repre&s;entations were from the very &s;ame
Places, and Signed by the very &s;ame
Hands which had Signed Sir <HI>Pol</HI>'s Petiti|ons,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) from <HI>Harry Woollpack</HI> and his
Friends, abovenamed; which was a clear
Proof, that Party and Faction had pro|cured
the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> and Truth and Rea&s;on had
procured the <HI>fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Pol</HI> finding that it thus went
again&s;t him, and that he was in danger
of lo&s;ing his Cau&s;e, had got one Card left
to play, which indeed carried the whole
Cau&s;e, and ruined all the Mea&s;ures which
<HI>Alderman Traffick</HI> had laid for making this
Partner&s;hip EFFECTUAL; and this was
to bring a MOB and make a Tumult
round about the Court; The&s;e <HI>old Scheme</HI>
had prepared for his Attendants, con&s;i&s;t|ing
of <HI>Harry Woollpack</HI>'s Servants and De|pendants,
tho' their Ma&s;ter was with|drawn,
as before, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Cloth-workers,
Dyers, Packers, Calenders, Setters, Hot|pre&s;&s;ers,
<HI>Blackwell-Hall</HI> FACT-ORS, with
<PB N="74" REF="73">
their Apprentices. Porters, Carmen, and
whatever Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and <HI>Scheme</HI> by their
mighty Intere&s;t could get together. The&s;e
rai&s;ed a Hubbub without the Court,
crying out, no Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> no <HI>Tariff;</HI>
&s;end away Count <HI>Tariff!</HI> Let the <HI>Dutch</HI>
or the Devil have Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> and
Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> too, we care not; no
TARIFF, no TARIFF; likewi&s;e all the
while the Court were con&s;idering of the
Ca&s;e, and preparing to give their Opi|nion,
Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and <HI>old Scheme,</HI> who had
now no other Game to play, and were
at their Wits end, interrupted them with
a hideous Noi&s;e and Clamour; crying no
<HI>Tariff,</HI> no <HI>Tariff;</HI> nay, &s;ome it &s;eems cryed,
no <HI>Trade,</HI> no <HI>Tariff.</HI></P>
<P>This, <HI>as Noi&s;e generally does in the like
Ca&s;es,</HI> was &s;aid to have influenced many,
whether it intimidated any or no, Hi&s;tory
is &s;ilent as to that; but Sir <HI>Pol</HI> &s;aw evi|dently,
that it had turned the Scale very
much on his Side: At length a certain
<HI>Suffolk Gentleman</HI> then in Court, de&s;ired
leave to offer an Expedient to appea&s;e
the pre&s;ent Tumult, and &s;atisfy all Parties;
which having been granted, he began to
&s;peak He acknowledged, <Q REND="inline">'<HI>That</HI> he had
been as forward as any for the <HI>Count</HI>'s co|ming
over; he &s;aid, <HI>that</HI> he was &s;till of the
<PB N="75" REF="74">
Opinion, that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was capable
of laying a good Foundation for the In|tere&s;t
of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and <HI>that</HI> he ab|horred
the Tricks and Forgeries of Sir
<HI>Pol,</HI> and his Sham-Evidence <HI>Old Scheme,</HI>
as much as any one did; <HI>that</HI> he had
given his A&s;&s;i&s;tance in drawing the
Partner&s;hip now in Debate, and did
think the Articles of it were a &s;ufficient
Ground to e&s;tabli&s;h the Commerce of
the Nation upon: <HI>But that,</HI> in regard
the Noi&s;e was &s;o great, and the Cla|mour
without doors &s;o loud, <HI>that</HI> nei|ther
the Count nor his Witne&s;&s;es could
be heard; and that the Term being now
expiring, <HI>the Court</HI> could not &s;it long
enough to determine a thing of &s;o great
Con&s;equence; he propo&s;ed therefore <HI>that</HI>
Per&s;ons might be cho&s;en on both &s;ides,
and appointed <HI>to adju&s;t &s;uch Matters as were
not fully &s;ettled,</HI> and to <HI>explain the &s;everal
Meanings</HI> of both &s;ides; &s;o that <HI>an entire
Scheme of the Trade,</HI> which Count <HI>Tariff</HI>
propo&s;ed, <HI>might be framed, which might
fully an&s;wer the good Intentions of the
LANDLADY for the Good and Welfare
of her Tenants:</HI> And that to this pur|po&s;e,
the Debate about confirming the
Articles of the Partner&s;hip with Count
<HI>Tariff,</HI> and making the &s;ame EFFEC|TUAL,
<PB N="76" REF="75">
might be delayed for the pre|&s;ent,
to be rea&s;&s;umed the fir&s;t Cau&s;e
next <HI>Michaelmas-Term,</HI> and then to be
fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, try'd and determined,
by a Jury of <HI>Landed-Men,</HI> to be retur|ned
by all the High Sheriffs of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI>
and that in the mean time Di|rection
might be given, that the Court
might be impo&s;ed upon by no more
Counterfeits, no more Goodman FACTS,
but that the true Merchant FACT of
<HI>London</HI> might be found out, and de&s;ired
to appear; to whom all due Re&s;pect,
Honour and Regard, &s;hould be &s;hewn
by the Court.'</Q></P>
<P>This, after &s;ome Debate, being put to
the Que&s;tion, and carry'd by a Majority
of nine Voices, the Cau&s;e was put off
accordingly.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mynheer <HI>Van Coopman&s;chap,</HI>
who lay all this while concealed at a cer|tain
Lawyer's Chamber in the <HI>Temple,</HI>
had an Account of this Succe&s;s, he came
down to the Club with great Joy, having
fir&s;t, by Advice of Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and other Mem|bers
of his Acquaintance, &s;ent &s;everal
Loads of Fagots to <HI>Ba&s;inghall-&s;treet, Spittle|fields,
Ludgate-bill,</HI> and other convenient
Places, to make Bonfires and plea&s;e their

<P><PB N="77" REF="76">
Being come into the Club, <Q REND="inline">'he return'd
them his hearty Thanks for the great

a&s;&s;ured them he would endeavour to re|turn,

falling out with their LANDLADY,
or in whatever Bu&s;ine&s;s, they &s;hould re|quire
his A&s;&s;i&s;tance.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>He told them,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'He hop'd they would
continue the &s;ame Care for his Affairs,
again&s;t the next Term; and e&s;pecially,
to provide good Advocates to plead for
him: He likewi&s;e told them, he doubted
not but he &s;hould renew his Partner|&s;hip
with Count <HI>Tariff</HI> the next Morn|ing,
for he was a Per&s;on that could not
be out of Bu&s;ine&s;s:'</Q> And &s;o making a
<HI>very low Bow,</HI> he offered to take his Leave.</P>
<P>But Sir <HI>Pol</HI> making a Sign to him to
&s;tay, &s;tood up, and &s;poke to him to the
following Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>He told him,</HI> <Q REND="inline"><P>The Society was very
glad they had been &s;erviceable to him
in this Affair; that they were well &s;a|tisfied
that he &s;hould enter into the
Partner&s;hip with Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> as he
de&s;ired, tho' thereby he &s;hould engro&s;s
all the Trade to him&s;elf; that they
would not fail to u&s;e their Intere&s;t, to
<PB N="78" REF="77">
get him good Lawyers to plead for him
again&s;t next Term; and particularly he
told him, that they would u&s;e their
Endeavours to get the High Sheriffs to
return him a good Jury, who &s;hould
be as willing to give up the Trade of
the Kingdom to him as the Club had
been; which, he &s;aid, required a great
deal of Art and good Management on
their part to bring to pa&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>He put him in mind however,</HI> That the
Club had pawn'd their Credit with
<HI>Harry Wool-pack</HI> and his Friends in the
Country, and with all the Mob that
they had gotten together to make a
Noi&s;e for him: that he (<HI>Mynheer</HI>) and
his Partners in <HI>Holland,</HI> would take off
all their Woollen Manufactures and Fi&s;h;
and, that they &s;hould have no Lo&s;s by
their refu&s;ing the Partner&s;hip with
Count <HI>Tariff:</HI> which if <HI>I</HI> had not done,
<HI>&s;ays Sir Pol,</HI> and my good Friend here
Mr. SCHEME, you had had no Ap|pearance
for you to day, and had cer|tainly
lo&s;t your Point: And therefore
<HI>Mynheer,</HI> &s;aid Sir <HI>Pol</HI> we hope you will
be as good as your Word, and keep up
our Credit with the Country, without
which we &s;hall never be able to get
you a good Jury cho&s;en.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="78">
<HI>Mynheer</HI> chang'd the Air of his Coun|tenance
upon this Propo&s;al, and told
them <HI>coldly,</HI> he would do them what
Service he could; but that as to the
Fi&s;h-Trade, it was out of his way to
buy any in <HI>Britain,</HI> he having Ships of
his own with which he could catch them
on our <HI>North-coa&s;ts</HI> &s;ooner than we did
our &s;elves.</P>
<P>But as to our Woollen Manufactures,
he &s;aid he would take a pretty large
Quantity of <HI>Gloce&s;ter&s;hire-cloths</HI> and <HI>Exe|ter-&s;erges;</HI>
only he &s;aid he mu&s;t have
the Cloths WHITE, and the Serges
in the GREASE, becau&s;e the Dying,
Dre&s;&s;ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was to be done in <HI>Hol|land,</HI>
that his own poor Servants might
be employed.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus, he withdrew; and
the next Morning having enter'd into a
Parner&s;hip with Count <HI>Tariff, for one
Year certain,</HI> they went away together for
<HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> where, as we are informed,
they drive a very great Trade; and Count
<HI>Tariff,</HI> in particular, has already bought
a very great Quantity of <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods
of him, with 20000 Hog&s;heads of <HI>Guel|derland</HI>
Tobacco, and other Goods in pro|portion.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="79">
The Club being thus di&s;appointed, ap|peared
very much dejected; and we hear
that <HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> and his Friends are
gone home into the Country, in a Fret,
di&s;oblig'd and di&s;&s;atisfied; as they might
very well be, their Manufactures being
thrown back upon their hands by the
<HI>Dutchman</HI> now his own Ends were &s;er|ved.</P>
<P>Mynheer <HI>Van Coopman&s;chap</HI> being gone,
and Count <HI>Tariff</HI> al&s;o, the Chair-man
thought fit to appoint, that the Com|mittee
&s;hould meet every Evening to
concert Mea&s;ures for the carrying on the
Intere&s;t of <HI>Mynheer,</HI> according to their
Promi&s;e; and to oppo&s;e every one that
in the lea&s;t countenanced the Partner&s;hip
with Alderman <HI>Traffick:</HI> And to the end
that this might be done more effectually,
Sir <HI>Pol</HI> propo&s;ed, that they &s;hould &s;end
for their Scots Pamphleteer, who had for|merly
done them very good Service in
frequent publi&s;hing their Scandals, and
who being lately fled from Ju&s;tice, had
been entertained in <HI>Coopman&s;chap</HI>'s Family
abroad. This was no &s;ooner agreed to,
but the Fugitive appeared in the Club,
having been lurking about the Town for
&s;ome time; and was &s;et immediately to
work to write Pamphlets in Favour of
Mynheer <HI>Coopman&s;chap.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="80">
It cannot be expected we can collect all
the &s;currilous Invectives which Hi&s;tory has
given an Account of, that were written up|on
this Occa&s;ion, as well again&s;t Count
<HI>Tariff,</HI> as again&s;t the LANDLADY her
&s;elf; the fir&s;t were e&s;pecially directed to re|concile
the People to the breaking off the

<P>This was the more difficult for them
to effect, becau&s;e <HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> had

&s;een &s;o much of his Knavery in the <HI>late

di&s;cover'd him to be no FACT, but meer
<HI>Sir Pol Fal&s;hood,</HI> di&s;gui&s;ed in the Habit of
the true Merchant FACT; that he
was gone down in the Country di&s;gu&s;ted,
and had openly &s;aid, they were a Pack
of Knaves; and, that he would never
have any more to do with them; that
they were in a Confederacy with <HI>Old
Coopman&s;chap,</HI> to enrich him at the Ex|pence
<PB N="82" REF="81">
of their Country, and to let him
make a Monopoly of the Engli&s;h Trade.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Pol</HI> was not ignorant, that it was ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary, in order to prevent their pre|&s;ent
De&s;ign, that they &s;hould bring over this
<HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> again; and to this end,
they were to &s;et all their Engines at work
to blow Du&s;t into his Eyes, that he &s;hould
not &s;ee too far into their Mea&s;ures. The
Methods they took for this, as is &s;aid be|fore,
are too many to be in&s;erted in this
place; but the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times
cannot fail to &s;upply the Want. It may
&s;uffice to let the Reader know, that this
was diligently endeavoured by charging
Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> with the Breach of a
Partner&s;hip he had been engaged in with
<HI>Don Seba&s;tian,</HI> a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Merchant, and
with threatning what a great Damage it
would be to <HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> if <HI>Don Se|bastian</HI>
&s;hould take the Pett, and refu&s;e to
Trade with him and his Friends; altho'
it was well known that <HI>Don Seba&s;tian</HI> had
no other Market for his own Goods, nor
could he be &s;upplied any other way with
&s;uch Goods as <HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> Traded
in; and be&s;ides all that, <HI>Don Seba&s;tian</HI>
was &s;o Embarra&s;&s;ed, with reference to
a neighbouring Merchant, who de|manded
great Arrears from him, of an
<PB N="83" REF="82">
old Contract that was between them,
which amounted to more than the &s;aid
<HI>Don Seba&s;tian</HI> was able to pay; that he
was fain to make u&s;e of Alderman <HI>Traf|fick,</HI>
and his Intere&s;t, to prevent a very
great Suit at <HI>Law</HI> being commenc'd again&s;t
him; and it was very improbable that he
would do any thing &s;o very affronting to
Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> as what the&s;e Men
talked of, at the &s;ame time that he was
&s;o much obliged to him other ways.</P>
<P>On the other hand, <HI>Don Seba&s;tian</HI> &s;aw
that there was &s;o much Nece&s;&s;ity for
what Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> had done, with
re&s;pect to &s;ome Particulars of their Part|ner&s;hip,
that he appeared very well &s;a|tisfied
therewith, and did not pretend to
take any Step that look'd as if there was
any Unkindne&s;s between them: So that
all the Clamour on that &s;ide cea&s;ed, and
<HI>Don Seba&s;tian</HI> very freely offered to renew
his Partner&s;hip with Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI>
upon Terms of Friend&s;hip, and good
Corre&s;pondence, and to Trade together
as much as ever they did. On the other
hand, Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> e&s;pou&s;ed the In|tere&s;t
of <HI>Don Seba&s;tian</HI> &s;o heartily and &s;o
effectually, being made Arbitrator between
him and his Neighbour <HI>Don Philippo</HI> the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchant, that he got that Breach
<PB N="84" REF="83">
amicably made up, and a chargeable Suit
at Law, which he was threatned with,
effectually prevented.</P>
<P>This was &s;uch a piece of Service to
<HI>Don Seba&s;tian,</HI> and he being a Per&s;on of
great Honour and Gratitude, was made
&s;o &s;en&s;ible of it, that it prevented all
manner of Mi&s;under&s;tanding between
him and Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> to the great
Mortification of Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and his Friends,
who had made a mighty great Noi&s;e of
this Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Being di&s;appointed in their Mea&s;ures
in this Particular, and not able to bring
over <HI>Harry Wooll-pack,</HI> as they de&s;igned to
do, to their Party; the next thing they
went about was, to &s;ee what they were
able to do as to getting a pack'd Jury
again&s;t Count <HI>Tariff</HI>'s Tryal came on.</P>
<P>Writing Pamphlets, and filling the
Country with mo&s;t abominable Untruths,
Scandal, Slander, and fal&s;e Rumours, to
make the People unea&s;y, this was their
&s;tated never-failing Method; but the
main Point was, to bring the Character
of Count <HI>Tariff</HI> into Contempt; to which
nothing was wanting, that could po&s;&s;ibly
be done by Men who neither valued their
own Reputation, or any Man's el&s;e; nay,
even the LANDLADY her &s;elf was in
<PB N="85" REF="84">
a mo&s;t unchri&s;tian manner in&s;ulted by
their Writers, and treated with the great|e&s;t
Indecency imaginable, although they
knew her to be the be&s;t of Landladies,
and though they enjoyed their Shops with
the utmo&s;t Quiet under her, paying as
little Rent as could be expected; and
although &s;he had &s;ucce&s;sfully protected
them again&s;t all tho&s;e who would have
di&s;turbed them.</P>
<P>Whenever the&s;e Pamphleteers had
printed any thing that treated their &s;aid
LANDLADY either di&s;re&s;pectfully or
injuriou&s;ly, or that in&s;ulted her in the
Government of her own Affairs; the
Club indu&s;triou&s;ly conveyed tho&s;e Prints
throughout the whole Kingdom, and
&s;pread them among all her Tenants and
Servants, in order to accu&s;tom and inure
them to treat her in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>As to her immediate Servants, they were
treated by the&s;e People in the mo&s;t &s;can|dalous
manner imaginable; and upon all
Occa&s;ions &s;o &s;currilou&s;ly and injuriou&s;ly
u&s;ed in their ordinary Bu&s;ine&s;s, and in the
Di&s;charge of their Duty to their <HI>Landlady</HI>
and <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> that it look'd not only as if
the&s;e Men had a Right &s;uperior even to
their <HI>Landlady</HI> her &s;elf, but that &s;he
was not lawfully Lady of the Manour,
<PB N="86" REF="85">
or were not rightful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the Te|nements
which &s;he had let to them.</P>
<P>This they thought was u&s;eful to awe
and brow-beat tho&s;e good Country Peo|ple
who&s;e proper Bu&s;ine&s;s it was to bring
the Names of tho&s;e Gentlemen to the
High Sheriffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who were to return
the Jury by whom Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was to
be tryed.</P>
<P>But this had a quite contrary Effect;
for when the Country Tenants, e&s;pecially
<HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> and his People, came to
&s;ee how their good <HI>Landlady</HI> was &s;erved,
for whom they had an un&s;eigned Zeal
and Affection; and upon what Account,
and with what little Rea&s;on &s;he was &s;o
unmannerly and undutifully handled, it
rai&s;ed their Pa&s;&s;ions to the highe&s;t degree,
and they re&s;olved to have nothing to do
with Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and his Party.</P>
<P>This al&s;o had a good effect the other
way; for, it di&s;covered the De&s;igns of
Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and his CLUB, and it gave the
People Warning again&s;t being farther im|po&s;ed
upon; by which means there ap|pears
a general good Di&s;po&s;ition among
them all, to choo&s;e &s;uch a Jury as &s;hall
hear the Cau&s;e of Count <HI>Tariff</HI> with Im|partiality,
and that will not be bullied
by Sir <HI>Politick Fal&s;hood</HI> and his <HI>Fal&s;e-beard,</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="86">
or be put off from doing Ju&s;tice by the
Noi&s;e of his Rabble; &s;o that there is no
Que&s;tion but the Partner&s;hip between
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> and Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> will
be approved, and the Articles thereof,
upon a fair and full hearing of the Cau&s;e,
be made EFFECTUAL.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>SInce the afore&s;aid Memoirs were
written, we are given to under|&s;tand,
that there are divers Ac|counts
come from abroad, of the great
Joy which the rejecting Count <HI>Tariff</HI> in
<HI>England,</HI> had occa&s;ioned in <HI>France,</HI> e&s;pe|cially
among the Manufacturers of Woollen
Goods in the &s;everal Provinces of <HI>Languedoc,
Pictou, Anjou,</HI> &amp;c. where upon the fir&s;t
News of the Treaty of a Partner&s;hip be|tween
Count <HI>Tariff;</HI> and <HI>Harry Woollpack,</HI>
Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> and others in <HI>London,</HI>
the People were under the greate&s;t Con&s;ter|nation
imaginable; knowing that if that
<HI>Partner&s;hip</HI> went on, and &s;hould be made
EFFECTUAL by Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI>'s
<HI>Landlady;</HI> and that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> had come
off at his Tryal with that Applau&s;e which
they heard was expected, their &s;everal
Undertakings of Woollen Manufactures
in tho&s;e Places would be ruined.</P>
<P>They had repre&s;ented this before to
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> him&s;elf, humbly Addre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="89" REF="88">
and Entreating him not to enter into
Partner&s;hip with Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> for
that it would be to the ruin of his own
Country if he did: They al&s;o applyed
them&s;elves to their own <HI>Landlord,</HI> to try
if he could be prevailed upon to prevent
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> from entering into any En|gagement
which would be &s;o fatal to all
his Tenants.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Landlord</HI>'s Circum&s;tances were
at that time &s;uch, that he could not con|veniently
interpo&s;e in the Matter; for
Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI>'s <HI>Landlady,</HI> and he, had
newly ended a long and chargeable SUIT
at LAW, and being made Friends, he
was unwilling to Di&s;oblige her, tho' he
complyed with Conditions, which at other
Times he would not have done; nor had
the Partner&s;hip with Count <HI>Tariff</HI> ever
been made upon &s;uch advantageous Terms,
if it had not been &s;o.</P>
<P>Being thus repul&s;ed by their <HI>Landlord,</HI>
the poor Manufacturers had no recour&s;e
but to Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> entreating him not
to engage with Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> and
repre&s;enting that it would be their utter
ruin, <HI>if they did;</HI> that they &s;hould never
get any WOOLL to go on with their
Manufactures, and without which it was
impo&s;&s;ible for them to carry on their
<PB N="90" REF="89">
Trade: They knew, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> that Al|derman
<HI>Traffick,</HI> and his Partner <HI>Harry
Woollpack,</HI> were utter Enemies to them
and to their Employment, and would
Effectually put a &s;top to their having any
Wooll from <HI>Great-Britain</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> with|out
which they &s;hould be all undone;
whereas tho&s;e People who had managed
the Trade in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> formerly, were
very ea&s;ie in that Affair, and at lea&s;t
were &s;lack in preventing the Exportation
of their Wooll; &s;o that they could get over
whatever Quantity they had occa&s;ion
for.</P>
<P>They farther repre&s;ented to him, that
if he went on with this Partner&s;hip, it
would bring in &s;uch a prodigious Quan|tity
of <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> from <HI>Eng|land</HI>
upon them; and that &s;o much bet|ter
than any they could make at home,
that no one would buy their Goods made
in <HI>France:</HI> As to the high Duties which
they were informed he would take off,
they repre&s;ented, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manu|factures
would not only be better than
theirs, but would thereby be <HI>cheaper al&s;o;</HI> for
that notwith&s;tanding their People worked
as cheap, and fared as hard as any Peo|ple
in the World, yet they were but
young, and unexperienced in the Trade,
<PB N="91" REF="90">
and had not the Arts of doing every
thing &s;o at fir&s;t hand, as the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> Nor
had they Materials as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had,
but at very remote di&s;tances, and upon
much dearer Terms than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had;
&s;o that AS it had been impo&s;&s;ible for them
to &s;et up their &s;everal Manufactures, if
it had not been for Count <HI>Tariff</HI>'s break|ing
off his former Partner&s;hips in <HI>Britain,</HI>
in the Years 1667, 1687, and 1701, by
which the Markets were their own, and
they were admitted to &s;ell at what Price
they plea&s;ed; SO it would be impo&s;&s;ible
for them to go on with any Succe&s;s, if he
&s;hould renew his &s;aid Bu&s;ine&s;s; and en|gage
anew with the &s;aid <HI>Traffick</HI> and
<HI>Woollpack,</HI> who were &s;worn Enemies to
their Trade.</P>
<P>The&s;e Repre&s;entations, however im|portunate,
and made by va&s;t Numbers
of the &s;aid <HI>Count</HI>'s Tenants and Servants,
yet could not prevail with the <HI>Count</HI> at
all; e&s;pecially when Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI>'s
<HI>Landlady</HI> interpo&s;ed her good Offices to
have the Partner&s;hip agreed on; <HI>&s;o that</HI>
as you have heard the Affair went on
&s;ucce&s;sfully, and the Partner&s;hip was con|cluded;
only that it wanted &s;ome Ratifi|cations
to make the &s;ame EFFECTUAL
among <HI>Harry Woollpack</HI>'s Friends, and
others, as has been &s;hewn.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="91">
The poor Manufacturers being thus re|pul&s;ed,
were driven even to De&s;pair, and
had no remedy but Prayers and Tears,
for they are not &s;uch noi&s;ie Fellows as
our Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and old <HI>Scheme</HI> brought along
with them to the Parliament: They dare
not come up with their Mob at their heels,
and interrupt the A&s;&s;embly and Parlia|ments
of their Country, with their Cla|mours
and Cries of <HI>no Tariff!</HI> no <HI>Tariff!</HI>
no <HI>Engli&s;h Partner&s;hip!</HI> and the like; but
&s;eeing the &s;ame like to go on, they &s;at down
with a profound Submi&s;&s;ion to their <HI>Land|lord,</HI>
but at the &s;ame time crying uni|ver&s;ally
to one another, that they were all
undone, and their Trade ruined.</P>
<P>As their Grief was inexpre&s;&s;ible at the
pro&s;pect of the opening of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Commerce into <HI>France,</HI> &s;o when they
under&s;tood how things were like to go
in <HI>England,</HI> they began to revive in
their Hopes; and having their tru&s;ty
Agents in the Club in &s;elf, at <HI>London,</HI>
by whom they had Intelligence every
Po&s;t, how things went on, tho&s;e
Agents did not fail to pu&s;h forwards Sir
<HI>Pol</HI> and the <HI>Club,</HI> to in&s;ult Count <HI>Tariff</HI>
as much as po&s;&s;ible, and in order to this,
they &s;cattered about private Papers, &s;ig|nifying,
that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> had little or
<PB N="93" REF="92">
no Influence on the Woollen Manufa|ctures
in his own Country; that they
were now come to that Perfection, that
they valued <HI>no Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures <HI>at
all,</HI> but made them better at home;
and were able not only to &s;upply them|&s;elves,
but all the World, and even <HI>Bri|tain</HI>
it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the Men that put it into
Sir <HI>Pol</HI>'s Head, to impo&s;e a di&s;tracted
Notion upon the Club, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That
there was a Project &s;et up in <HI>France</HI> to
make Woollen Manufactures without
WOOLL at all; and thus they help'd
blow the Coals up in the Club again&s;t
Count <HI>Tariff;</HI> when, at the &s;ame time,
they in <HI>France</HI> were in the utmo&s;t Con|&s;ternation,
for fear his Articles with
Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> &s;hould be made EF|FECTUAL.</P>
<P>But
it is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Joy
of the poor People, all over the afore|&s;aid
Provinces, where the Woollen Ma|nufactures
are made, when their Agents
in the Club wrote them the following

we thought fit to Tran&s;late for the be|nefit
