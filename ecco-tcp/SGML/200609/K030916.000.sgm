<L>A CRITIC was of old a glorious name,</L>
<L>Who&s;e &s;anction handed merit up to fame:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6">
Beauties as well as faults he brought to view:</L>

<L>And &s;tab, like bravoes, all who come that way.</L>

<L>The thunder's fury rends the tow'ring oak,</L>

<L>UNHAPPY Genius! plac'd, by partial Fate,</L>

Where the reluctant Mu&s;e, oppre&s;s'd by kings,</L>
