<HEAD>THE
CASE
Fairly Stated between the
<HI>TURKY</HI> Company
AND THE
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchants.</HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>Turky</HI> Company wou'd
be but ill Charg'd with &s;o
much Art in the Conduct of
their Trade, if they were
capable of u&s;ing no Art in the
Defence of it.</P>
<P>No Man can charge them with want
of Cunning in what they now pu&s;h at,
<PB N="4" REF="3">
and had they us'd as much Hone&s;ty
in their Argument as they &s;hew Art in
their De&s;ign, &s;ome plain Que&s;tions and
An&s;wers wou'd bring us all to the
End of the Di&s;pute; and the Hou&s;e of
Lords had not had the Trouble of this
Act.</P>
<P>The Papers they have hitherto pub|li&s;h'd,
have generally aim'd at two
Things, and both of them &s;eem to be
unfair, and &s;omething &s;ophi&s;tical:
I am loth to call it Shuffling, with
re&s;pect to the Per&s;ons of the Gentle|men
concern'd; but Nece&s;&s;ity obliges
me to &s;ay, That what they offer, evi|dently
looks one Way but means ano|ther;
the &s;pecious Pretences they make
for the publick Good of Trade, En|couragement
of Manufactures, and the
like, are only Covers to conceal the
grand End of &s;eparate Intere&s;t; which,
'tis manife&s;t, is the Thing they aim
at.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They pretend in their Papers, to
advocate for the Good of their
Country, again&s;t the Encourage|ment
given by the <HI>Italian</HI> Mer|chant
to the <HI>French,</HI> to &s;ell their
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Cloth in <HI>Turky,</HI> by taking off the
Raw Silk, which is the Return;
whereas really, they are in their
Capacity as a Company, the Rea|&s;on
of all the Encouragement the
<HI>French</HI> meet with in the <HI>Turky</HI>
Trade; and if it were not for the
ill Conduct of the <HI>Turky</HI> Compa|ny,
the <HI>French</HI> wou'd have no
Silk to &s;ell, nor vend any Cloth
in <HI>Turky</HI> worth naming.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They pretend, that the &s;upport|ing
the <HI>Turky</HI> Company is the In|tere&s;t
of the Trade; whereas their
being a Company, in the Sen&s;e of
their pre&s;ent Management, is the
great Ob&s;truction of the Trade;
and will, if not re&s;train'd, be the
Ruin of it.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>In their Papers, therefore, it is evi|dent,
they aim (1.) at &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchant's Trade to <HI>Turky;</HI>
and (2.) at engro&s;&s;ing the Trade of
&s;elling Cloth in <HI>Turky,</HI> and of Silk in
<HI>England,</HI> in order to impo&s;ing their
own Price upon the Buyers of Cloth
Abroad, and the Manufacturers of
Silk at Home. Both which would, if
<PB N="6" REF="5">
obtain'd, effectually declare them a Mono|poly,
in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Sen&s;e of that Word.</P>
<P>Their Oppre&s;&s;ions Abroad, their un|fair
Dealings with the Merchants, who
from <HI>Leghorn</HI> interfere, as they call it,
with their Trade; their By-Laws, their
arbitrary Proceedings upon them, and all
the re&s;t of their ill Conduct, they give
up, and &s;eem to plead Guilty to them all,
&s;o they can but get this Bill.</P>
<P>With &s;o much Eagerne&s;s they pu&s;h for
this Bill, that they not only manag'd
their Introduction into it with the utmo&s;t
Art, and pu&s;h'd it on with unweary'd
Application, to hinder their Books being
look'd into, but they &s;aid they were wil|ling
to con&s;ent to any future Laws, to
limit, nay, even to puni&s;h their Exorbi|tance,
&s;o they may but be indulg'd with
the Advantages they drive at in this Bill.</P>
<P>In a Word, they were in &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion
for this darling Bill, that they are wil|ling
to give up their Reputation as a Com|pany,
&s;ubmit to all the Parliament may
think fit to do with them, or all the Pu|ni&s;hment
that may be inflicted upon them,
provided they may but &s;ave THIS BILL.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
It is their own Expre&s;&s;ion in one of
their Ca&s;es: <HI>Po&s;&s;ibly the</HI> Turky <HI>Company
may have committed Faults, and made un|fitting
By-Laws: If they have done both,
yet</HI> THIS BILL <HI>may be nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> And
in another Place, <HI>All that can be objected
against the</HI> Turky Company, <HI>may be re|medy'd
by a</HI> BILL <HI>in another Parliament,
and they may take</HI> ANOTHER TIME <HI>for
the remedying of it. If a Company op|pre&s;&s;es,
the Parliament may curb and re|&s;train
it by</HI> FUTURE LAWS. And the
like.</P>
<P>I wou'd not treat the Company with
Indecency, but this &s;eems to me to be
little more than that of a Man detected of
a grievous Tre&s;pa&s;s, craving Leave for an
immediate Power to oppre&s;s and injure
his Neighbour, and putting off the Ex|amination
and Puni&s;hment of his own
Crime to another Sea&s;on; as if the re|medying
the Grievance on one &s;ide, had
not the &s;ame Ju&s;tice in it, and did not
call for the &s;ame Concern of the Publick
to rectify, as the other. I might have
illu&s;trated this by a more &s;evere Simily,
if I were willing to carry Things to the
heighth.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
But let us take the&s;e Gentlemen in their
own Way, and u&s;e their own Words, as
above: <HI>Po&s;&s;ibly the Company have commit|ted
Faults, and made unfitting By-Laws:</HI>
It is mo&s;t certain they have, (and I inter
what I believe every one will grant, <HI>viz.</HI>)
Therefore it is not rea&s;onable, tho&s;e that
have already abus'd their Power, &s;hou'd
be now enabled to abu&s;e it farther. And
I humbly hope that the Nature of the
Companies By-Laws and Orders may be
in&s;pected.</P>
<P>What they now a&s;k, is neither more
or le&s;s, than to have a Power granted
them to oppre&s;s and injure the Traders
to <HI>Turky</HI> by way of <HI>Italy;</HI> who, they grant
already, they have injur'd and oppre&s;s'd.
As to the Bill they demand, the Nature
of it &s;hall pre&s;ently appear, when the
Fraud of the De&s;ign is more effectually
laid open. Something extraordinary mu&s;t
&s;ure be the Ca&s;e, that the&s;e Men are &s;o
very earne&s;t to have the Examination of
the Conduct of the <HI>Turky</HI> Company put
off; it is a &s;hrewd Su&s;picion of Guilt,
when Men are &s;o extraordinary &s;hy of
coming to an Examination; &s;ee how it
runs thro' all their Arguings: <HI>If the Bill
pa&s;&s;es,</HI> &s;ay they again, <HI>the Conduct of the</HI>
Turky Company, <HI>all their</HI> By-Laws, <HI>and</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<HI>even their</HI> Charter, <HI>if lyable to any ju&s;t
Exceptions, may be examin'd afterwards
by Parliament.</HI> Very good, and why not
now? Why mu&s;t not the Parliament be
allow'd to examine Now into their Con|duct,
their By-Laws, their Oppre&s;&s;ions,
their arbitrary Proceedings, and their
Charter, if lyable to Exceptions, as there
is &s;ome Rea&s;on to believe they all are?</P>
<P>Nor is the examining into the&s;e Things
&s;o incongruous to the Bill depending as
they would in&s;inuate: I alledge, and un|dertake
to make it appear, that the Bill
they &s;eek cannot be rational, if the other
Conduct of the Company is fully examin'd
into; and therefore it is not at all unrea|&s;onable
to demand, that both be enter'd
into together; 'tis a great Mi&s;take to &s;ay,
that the Conduct of the Company has no
Relation to this Bill. On the contrary,
if the Company have mi&s;behav'd, if they
have oppre&s;s'd and injur'd the Fair-Tra|ders,
if their by-Laws are unju&s;t, and
they are a real Monopoly, and ablove all,
if they &s;eek to be able to act as a Mono|poly
by Virtue of this Bill, then 'tis ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to examine their Con|duct
before this Bill &s;hould pa&s;s. <HI>As for
Example.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
If this Bill in its Nature tends to
making the Company a Monopoly; if it
is evident, that in &s;oliciting <HI>this Bill,</HI>
they aim at a Power to monopolize; if
it appears, that <HI>this Bill,</HI> if pa&s;s'd, will
put that Power into their Hands: Then,
with humble Submi&s;&s;ion to the Hou&s;e, it
is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to examine into
the Abu&s;e of the Power they have, and
the Rea&s;on of the Power they &s;eek, and
of their &s;eeking it, and all before this
Bill be &s;uffer'd to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>And what can it be, but this plain
Dependance of the&s;e Things, one upon
another, that makes the&s;e Men &s;o back|ward
to have their Conduct examin'd?
But that they are &s;en&s;ible, that if the
Hou&s;e &s;hould ran&s;ack their Behaviour and
the U&s;e they have made of the Powers
and Privileges which they have been en|tru&s;ted
with, they would &s;ee very good
Rea&s;on to con&s;ider well of it before they
entru&s;ted them any farther.</P>
<P>Nor is this an unju&s;t or an unfair Re|flection,
becau&s;e we that are oppre&s;s'd by
the Company, and have Rea&s;on, feelingly,
to mention the Abu&s;e of the Powers they
have been entru&s;ted with, have much
<PB N="11" REF="10">
more Rea&s;on than other Men to conclude
what U&s;e they would make of it, if far|ther
Powers were committed to them as
a Company.</P>
<P>And here, becau&s;e I am nece&s;&s;arily to
enter with Plainne&s;s and Freedom upon
the Detecting a general Scheme of Fraud
and Inju&s;tice, which evidently &s;eems to
run thro' the whole Cour&s;e of this Mat|ter,
and that, as above, much le&s;s Hone&s;ty
than Art &s;hews it&s;elf in the earne&s;t So|licitations
which are and have been made
for this Bill, I mu&s;t be allow'd to di|&s;tingui&s;h
between the Gentlemen con|cern'd
in their per&s;onal and private Ca|pacities,
and in their Capacities as a Com|pany.</P>
<P>In
their former Capacities, I have no|thing
in the lea&s;t to &s;ay; here is no per|&s;onal
Satyr intended, nor do I direct any
Reflection, in this Affair, to this or that
particular Man. There are, without
Doubt, many worthy and honourable
Per&s;ons in the <HI>Turky</HI> Company.</P>
<P>But their Conduct, as a Company, is
another Thing; and no Man's private
Reputation is concern'd in it; and yet
<PB N="12" REF="11">
I mu&s;t acknowledge my &s;elf to be of the
&s;ame Mind which King <HI>Charles</HI> IId gave
as his Opinion to a certain Lord Mayor
of <HI>London,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) That it was not po&s;|&s;ible
for a Man to act in a Society with
the &s;ame Hone&s;ty and Ju&s;&s;ice as in their
&s;eparate and private Capacities; but that
all Societies and Companies were Tyrants
and Oppre&s;&s;ors by the Nature of the
Thing.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e Po&s;tulata with the
Gentlemen-Members of the Company, as
private Per&s;ons, I &s;hall, with the more
Freedom, &s;peak to their Behaviour as a
Company.</P>
<P>I have mention'd how &s;trange it is that
the&s;e Gentlemen &s;hould be &s;o very Earne&s;t
for this Bill, and for its pa&s;&s;ing, without
enquring into their Conduct. I &s;hall now
unravel this My&s;tery, and lay it open to
the World; and when I have done &s;o,
the Wonder will cea&s;e.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The fir&s;t Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e en|quiring
into their pa&s;t Conduct,
will nece&s;&s;arily di&s;cover the True,
but conceal'd De&s;ign of <HI>the Bill.</HI></ITEM>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<ITEM>2. It will di&s;cover the Rea&s;on for
endeavouring to obtain it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. It will di&s;cover the Con&s;equences
of it, if obtain'd.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>That the Di&s;covery of any, or of all
the&s;e Things, would mo&s;t effectually o|verthrow
the Bill, &s;eems rea&s;onable for
me to conclude, from the Knowledge I
have of the certain Application of the
Hou&s;e of Peers, to detecting all clande&s;tine
Mea&s;ures, Projects, and Attempts, couch'd
under the &s;pecious Pretence of Right,
Property, Publick Good, and the like;
by which the Subjects are frequently im|pos'd
upon, the Publick abus'd, and pri|vate
Per&s;ons injur'd.</P>
<P>It will be impo&s;&s;ible the Hou&s;e can &s;ee
the exact Connection that there is between
the former Conduct of that Company and
the Attempt couch'd under the Cover of
<HI>this Bill,</HI> and not &s;ee how artfully they
&s;eek to protect their pa&s;t ill Conduct, by
obtaining an Authority for wor&s;e; and
to &s;upport the Oppre&s;&s;ions of their former
Mea&s;ures, by enlarging them in tho&s;e
they &s;hould now get Power to act by.
<PB N="14" REF="13">
To bring this Home to the Point in Di&s;|cute,
that is to &s;ay, <HI>the Bill.</HI></P>
<P>The Pretences of the Bill are &s;pecious,
(<HI>viz.</HI>)
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Raw Silk which the
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchants import from
<HI>Leghorn,</HI> is <HI>French,</HI> and the Re|turn
for their <HI>French</HI> Cloths &s;old
in <HI>Turky.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Quantity of the &s;aid
Silk imported into <HI>England</HI> is
very great.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That it is injurious to the <HI>Turky</HI>
Trade.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If the&s;e Things were really &s;o, every
Man &s;hould grant the Con&s;equence at the
fir&s;t Word, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that <HI>the Bill was ne|ce&s;&s;ary,</HI>
which is what they alledge.</P>
<P>But, as was &s;aid in one of the <HI>Italian</HI>
Merchant's Ca&s;es, The&s;e Things would
go a <HI>great Way in the Charge;</HI> but for one
Misfortune <HI>attending them, which is,</HI> that
<HI>they happen not to be TRUE.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
The chiefe&s;t Evidence they bring of it,
is, That in the Years 1714 and 1715, a
very great Quantity of Raw Silk was
bought in <HI>France,</HI> brought to <HI>Leghorn,</HI>
and &s;hipp'd to <HI>England.</HI> Now, tho' I
&s;hould grant this, that in tho&s;e two Years
a great deal of <HI>French</HI> Raw Silk was brought
from <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> yet that will neither prove
that it has been &s;o in other Years, or that
it can ever happen &s;o again: Nor if it were
to happen again, can they argue from it
any Advantage to the <HI>French</HI> Trade, or
Di&s;advantage to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but ju&s;t the
contrary, as will appear in the following
Heads:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. From the Rea&s;on and Occa&s;ion of the
<HI>French</HI> Merchants having that great
Quantity of Raw Silk upon their
Hands at that Time (<HI>viz.</HI>) That they
had a Pro&s;pect of an open Trade with
<HI>England</HI> for their Wrought Silks,
<HI>the Treaty of Commerce being then on
foot here;</HI> Which failing, and the
Alteration of their Coin happening
at the &s;ame Time, they were oblig'd
to &s;ell off the Silk Raw at a very
great Lo&s;s; &s;o that half the Ban|quiers
of <HI>Paris,</HI> half the Banquiers
of <HI>Lions,</HI> and almo&s;t all the Mer|chants
<PB N="16" REF="15">
at <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> were ruin'd by
it, and became Bankrupt, having lo&s;t
above one third of the Value of their
Capital Stock. If this be the Way
that the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants &s;hall al|ways
encourage the <HI>French</HI> Trade,
the <HI>French</HI> will have little to boa&s;t
of, and the <HI>Levant</HI> Company little
to complain of.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It is well known that the <HI>French</HI>
did not receive that great Quantity
of Silk, which was then upon their
Hands, in Return for Cloth, or any
Manufactures; all the Cloth that
cou'd have been in <HI>France</HI> cou'd not
have purchas'd it; but they &s;ent a|way
Ready Money, and bought up
&s;uch a Quantity, <HI>upon the Pro&s;pect</HI>
of Advantage by the Treaty of Com|merce
in <HI>England, as above;</HI> the
Di&s;appointment of which was the
Ruin of &s;o many Merchants there.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. When the Raw Silk in <HI>France</HI> was
thus cheap, and bought by us &s;o
much to their Lo&s;s, it was greatly
wanted in <HI>England;</HI> and the Price
in <HI>January</HI> 17 14/15, refus'd by <HI>Turky</HI>
Merchants here was 30<HI>s.</HI> and 32<HI>s.</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
<HI>per lb.</HI> and there was not Silk enough
to be had in <HI>England</HI> to employ our
Weavers, or to carry on our own Silk
Manufacture; <HI>&s;o that</HI> at this Time,
which the&s;e Men dwell &s;o much up|on,
the Importation of <HI>French Turky</HI>
Silk, was infinitely the Advantage
of our Trade, and in Proportion
ruinous to <HI>France.</HI> And the Silk &s;o
Imported was about <HI>June</HI> 1715 &s;old
to our Manufacturers in <HI>London,</HI> at
23 <HI>s.</HI> And the Price will be always
kept low, &s;o long as there can be
two Importations.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>This &s;ufficiently an&s;wers the great Im|portation
in the Years 1714, 1715, on
which the&s;e Men in&s;i&s;t &s;o much; and
proves that it was a Circum&s;tance of Trade
which can never happen again; and if
ever it &s;hou'd, wou'd, every Bale of it, be
an incredible Advantage to <HI>England,</HI> and
a Di&s;advantage to <HI>France.</HI> And 'tis hop'd
that an extraordinary Ca&s;e, which can
never in the ordinary Cour&s;e of Trade
happen again, will not be look'd upon a
&s;ufficient Rea&s;on to break into an Act,
which is the &s;upport of our Navigation.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">
That it cannot be thus now, is plain,
and the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants have made it
appear &s;o, by the Calculation of the Price
of Silk at <HI>Leghorn</HI> and at <HI>London;</HI> which
generally is, and for the la&s;t three Years
has been, from 1 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> to 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per lb.</HI>
cheaper in <HI>London</HI> than at <HI>Leghorn;</HI>
which is a &s;ure Rule to judge by, why
this Importation cannot be con&s;iderable;
for that Merchants never extend or con|tinue
a Trade that they cannot carry on
but to Lo&s;s. Nor, indeed, can there ever
be any con&s;iderable Importation of Raw
Silk from <HI>Leghorn,</HI> but when the <HI>Turky</HI>
Company, by their oppre&s;&s;ive Limitati|ons,
and other monopolizing Arts, re&s;train
or with-hold the Importation of a Quan|tity
&s;ufficient for the Market, on purpo&s;e
to advance the Price for their private
Gain. And this Engro&s;&s;ing is &s;o ea&s;y to
them, &s;uch a Grievance to Trade, and &s;o
injurious to our Manufactures in <HI>England,</HI>
that even the Po&s;&s;ibility of their doing &s;o
is an unan&s;werable Rea&s;on again&s;t their
Bill, and proves, that it not only is not
NECESSARY, as they pretend, but that
it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary their Power of
impo&s;ing upon the Market, as above,
&s;hould be re&s;train'd.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">
The <HI>&s;econd Head,</HI> is the Quantity
which they pretend is Imported, to which
the <HI>Turky</HI> Merchants have annex'd no E|vidence,
expecting to be taken upon their
Words. This Quantity they alledge to
be about an hundred Bales a Year; but
this the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants deny, and ap|peal
to the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Books for their
Proof: Al&s;o they have prov'd, at the Hou&s;e
of Commons, that in the current Year, all
the Raw Silk imported at <HI>Leghorn</HI> from
<HI>France,</HI> amounts to no more than thirty
&s;ix Bales: And that <HI>Italy,</HI> for expence of
their own Silk Manufacture, annually
u&s;es two or three hundred Bales of <HI>Turky</HI>
Raw Silk.</P>
<P>The la&s;t is, That this is injurious to
the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade; and this they explain
two Ways:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That it is the Return of the <HI>French</HI>
Cloths &s;old in <HI>Turky,</HI> and con&s;e|quently
a&s;&s;i&s;ts the <HI>French</HI> in their
Sale of Cloth in <HI>Turky.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That it ruins the Market for the
<HI>Turky</HI> Raw Silk here at <HI>London,</HI> by
&s;inking the Price of it &s;o, as to make
<PB N="20" REF="19">
the Merchant lo&s;e by his Goods, or
keep them on his Hands un&s;old.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is incumbent on the <HI>Levant</HI>
Company to prove, which they only bare|ly
a&s;&s;erted; when, on the contrary, the
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchants prov'd, that from <HI>Leg|horn,</HI>
according to the con&s;tant cour&s;e of
Trade, all the <HI>Turky</HI> Raw Silk imported
from <HI>Italy,</HI> was the Return of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Manufactures: And to this they offer'd to
call Merchants who had re&s;ided there for
the&s;e Forty Years la&s;t pa&s;t.</P>
<P>To the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants
&s;ay, That the affording all Commodities
to our Manufactures cheap, is a General
Benefit; and the Importing them dear,
will make our Neighbours under-&s;ell us.</P>
<P>Now, neither of the&s;e being true, as
above, how will it appear that this Trade
is injurious to the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade from and
to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Appearance of the&s;e Things being
thus, and all the&s;e Pretences for the Bill
being thus repeal'd and expos'd, it leads
me to the original De&s;ign of the <HI>Turky</HI>
Merchant's pu&s;hing this Affair &s;o warmly,
<PB N="21" REF="20">
and to enquire what mu&s;t be the true
Rea&s;ons for their de&s;iring the Bill to &s;top
the Importation of &s;o &s;mall a Quantity
of Raw Silk, as, <HI>communibus annis,</HI> is
brought into <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Leghorn.</HI></P>
<P>And this Que&s;tion nece&s;&s;arily carries
me back to view the State of the <HI>Turky</HI>
Trade, which I &s;hall &s;tudy to do as clear|ly
and with as much Brevity as I have
done the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>The Trade to <HI>Turky</HI> is carry'd on in a
Company; their Charter, their Privileges,
their Manner of carrying on their Trade
is known. The Number of Per&s;ons con|cern'd
in their Trade, or Free of their
Company, is great; they tell us, they are
above Two Hundred; and others may,
and indeed all, even the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants
them&s;elves, may be Free of this Company,
paying the u&s;ual Fine at their Admi&s;&s;ion,
and taking the Freedom of the City al&s;o.</P>
<P>But, I &s;uppo&s;e, it will not be contend|ed,
that the Gro&s;s of the Trade to <HI>Tur|ky</HI>
is carry'd on by a very few Men, and
even of tho&s;e few, a yet fewer Number
have the governing Influence of the Trade,
and can go far, very far, to limit the
<PB N="22" REF="21">
re&s;t by their Intere&s;t, to Ship or not to
Ship, Trade or not to Trade, as their
Quantities of Goods, Abroad or at Home,
want a Market, or want a Price.</P>
<P>And as this is an Article which renders
the Company a mo&s;t effectual Monopoly,
when they make U&s;e of it; &s;o it is evi|dent,
that it is but a little while &s;ince
they did effectually make U&s;e of it, to
the great Injury of the Trade; and this
Power, together with an Oath every Mer|chant
mu&s;t take, if he will come in to be
Free of this Company, and which &s;ubjects
him to be &s;ubject to &s;uch monopolizing
Arts as tho&s;e, is the Rea&s;on why the <HI>Ita|lian</HI>
Merchants have always declin'd the
Company, and carry'd on their Trade to
<HI>Turky</HI> by the Way of <HI>Leghorn.</HI></P>
<P>In Favour of this Trade, which, as it
is a fair and ju&s;t Branch of Commerce,
and was found to be very con&s;iderable;
but above all, as it was found to be a
ju&s;t Check upon the <HI>Turky</HI> Company,
and calculated to prevent the Encroach|ment
they were always apt to run into
for their private Ends, to the Injury of
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade and Art of Navigation,
a Law particularly calculated for the
<PB N="23" REF="22">
Encouragement of Trade, and the En|crea&s;e
of our Shipping, thought fit, by a
Clau&s;e on Purpo&s;e, to make Provi&s;ion for
the Trade of the &s;aid <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants,
and that they &s;hou'd be allow'd to im|port
the <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Goods by Way of <HI>Leg|horn.</HI></P>
<P>And
here, I mu&s;t &s;ay, lies the whole
Stre&s;s of the Bill now depending: It is
this Trade to <HI>Turky,</HI> by the Way of
<HI>Leghorn,</HI> that the <HI>Turky</HI> Merchants pu&s;h
at. The bringing &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Raw Silk
by Accident, and on an extraordinary Oc|ca&s;ion,
when it may be very cheap in
<HI>France,</HI> and very dear in <HI>England;</HI> this is
made the &s;pecious Pretence, but is nothing
in the Ca&s;e; it is the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchant's
Trading to <HI>Turky, Vi&acirc; Leghorn,</HI> that is
the Grievance. This is that they &s;hoot
at, tho' they &s;et up the other as a Blind.</P>
<P>To clear them&s;elves of this, and if
they would have the Hou&s;e believe them
to be as good Patriots as they pretend,
why do they not declare openly, that
they de&s;ire nothing but to prevent the
bringing in <HI>Turky</HI> Raw Silk bought of
the <HI>French,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> may not be
encourag'd to carry on the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade
<PB N="24" REF="23">
to their Di&s;advantage, and to &s;end greater
Quantities of <HI>French</HI> Cloth to <HI>Turky,</HI> and
the like?</P>
<P>Had this been the real and only Thing
they had &s;ought, what Need had they to
&s;trike at the Root of the <HI>Italian</HI> Trade,
which is &s;o much more con&s;iderable and
advantageous than their own? Why Pe|tition
for the Repeal of a Clau&s;e, which
admits them to bring Home the Returns
of their Trade to <HI>Turky?</HI> Why had they
not only pray'd, that an ACT might
pa&s;s to prohibit Raw Silk from <HI>France</HI> be|ing
imported by Way of <HI>Leghorn?</HI> in
which all the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants would
readily have concurr'd, and are &s;till ready
to do it.</P>
<P>Or, on the other hand, if they were
not a&s;ham'd at thus publickly aiming to
monopolize both the Cloth Trade in <HI>Tur|ky,</HI>
and the Silk Trade in <HI>England;</HI> I
&s;ay, if they were not a&s;ham'd of &s;uch an
open Attempt to engro&s;s an exclu&s;ive
Trade, and that they could think a Hou&s;e
of Commons, the Guardians of Liberty,
could be capable of being brought into
&s;uch an Inva&s;ion of the Liberties of Trade,
why did they not petition fairly, That
<PB N="25" REF="24">
the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants might not carry
<HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> Cloths, and Tin into <HI>Turky Vi&acirc;
Leghorn;</HI> or, in a Word, that, if they
did, they &s;hould not be allow'd to bring
back the Returns of it into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This had been, indeed, to have acted
with le&s;s Cunning, but with more Ho|ne&s;ty,
than to aim and &s;trike fairly at
this Prohibition, under Pretence of pro|hibiting
bringing in <HI>French Turky</HI> Silk;
a Thing, which, as it is prov'd, is &s;eldom
done, &s;o it is plain it can never be done,
but to our Advantage, and the Lo&s;s of
the <HI>French</HI> Merchants; <HI>unle&s;s it be,</HI> as
above, <HI>when the</HI> Turky <HI>Merchants have
put the Dice upon</HI> the Market, <HI>and rais'd
the Price to an unrea&s;onable and injurious
Heighth;</HI> and then the Refuge of a <HI>French</HI>
Market, or of any other Market, would
be but a Ju&s;tice to the Manufactures, and
a ju&s;t Check upon the Engro&s;&s;ers.</P>
<P>It &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary, in the next Place,
to give a &s;hort State of this <HI>By-Trade,</HI> as
they would call it, from <HI>Italy</HI> to <HI>Turky,</HI>
or from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Turky,</HI> by Way of
<HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25">
The <HI>Turky</HI> Merchants take much Pains
to repre&s;ent this Article as very &s;mall and
incon&s;iderable; but why then do they
not propo&s;e to the Parliament, that in the
Bill they &s;olicit for, a Clau&s;e be re&s;erv'd
for leaving this little, &s;mall, incon&s;idera|ble
Trade entirely free, and its Returns
free to be brought Home? If it be &s;mall,
the Damage to them mu&s;t likewi&s;e be
&s;mall: Why is it &s;o hotly oppos'd and
attack'd, if it were really &s;o &s;mall and
incon&s;iderable, as they repre&s;ent it? I can
an&s;wer for the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants, that
they would not have &s;truggled with them
for the pre&s;erving it; and even the Op|po&s;ition
made to them by the <HI>Italian</HI> Mer|chants,
is an Evidence to all the World,
that it is very far from being a &s;mall and
incon&s;iderable Trade.</P>
<P>By this very Thing the whole Quarrel
may be decided: If the <HI>Turky</HI> Merchants
aim only at, and de&s;ire only the prevent|ing
the bringing <HI>French Turky</HI> Silk hither,
and are willing to leave the <HI>Italian</HI> Trade
to <HI>Turky,</HI> and back to <HI>England,</HI> by the
Way of <HI>Leghorn,</HI> open, as it always was,
let them &s;ay &s;o; a&s;k for that, and the
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchants will heartily join with
them; but, while they thus pu&s;h at one
<PB N="27" REF="26">
Thing, under Pretence of another, they
mo&s;t plainly di&s;cover what they endeavour
to conceal.</P>
<P>It is meet, therefore, to put this Af|fair
in a clear Light. The <HI>Italian</HI> Mer|chants
Trade to <HI>Turky</HI> by Way of <HI>Leg|horn,</HI>
is far from being &s;mall or incon&s;i|derable;
they export and &s;ell in <HI>Turky</HI>
from 40 to 50 Thou&s;and Pounds a Year
in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth, and in Tin, Lead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
a con&s;iderable Sum, and they bring back
the Returns of it to <HI>Leghorn.</HI></P>
<P>Great Part of those Returns being &s;old
in <HI>Italy,</HI> the Produce of which mu&s;t be
clear Gain to the Publick Stock of <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> it would be very hard, if they
&s;hould be deny'd the Privilege of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Men, and of bringing Home the re&s;t to
&s;ell in their own Country, as Markets
may pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Except in the Ca&s;es already mention'd,
they bring no Silk from <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and
nothing but the Exorbitances of the <HI>Tur|ky</HI>
Company impo&s;ing upon the Markets,
as before, can make it practicable. If the
Hou&s;e thinks fit, even to prevent it under
tho&s;e Exorbitances, they &s;ubmit it wholly
<PB N="28" REF="27">
to the Wi&s;dom of Parliament; but they
humbly hope they have a Right of Pro|perty,
in common with the re&s;t of his
Maje&s;ty's faithful Subjects, to bring back,
and vend in open Market, the Returns of
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Cloths, and other
Products of their own Country, which
they export, and without which they can|not
carry on their Trade.</P>
<P>While the Company oppo&s;e &s;o ju&s;t a
Reque&s;t, how can they take it ill, that
we &s;ay they are a dangerous Monopoly?
and how can they clear them&s;elves of
the Charge, while they &s;eek to be the
only Exporters of Cloth to the whole
<HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire, and the only Importers
of Raw Silk to the King's Dominions?
Is it not plain, that in this Ca&s;e they would
con&s;ult their own Advantages rather than
the Demands or Occa&s;ions of the Manu|facturers?</P>
<P>This
is the Article the Company vi&s;i|bly
pre&s;s for; and it cannot be deny'd but
it is of great Con&s;equence to them, that
is to &s;ay, to them per&s;onally, and as a
Company: but the more it is &s;o, of the
more fatal Con&s;equence would it be to
the Trade in general, &s;eeing they would,
<PB N="29" REF="28">
as above, put their own Price upon their
Woollen Cloth at home, to the Impove|ri&s;hing,
if not De&s;truction of the Manu|facturer;
and their own Price upon their
Silk at Home: Nor would it weigh with
them, that by this Conduct they would
le&s;&s;en the Con&s;umption of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth
in <HI>Turky;</HI> and, to hold it up to a Price,
for their private Gain, keep it always
&s;carce at Market, forbidding their Mem|bers
in <HI>England</HI> to &s;hip but in general
Ships, &s;ometimes once a Year, &s;ometimes
once in two Years, or more, as they think
fit; without regarding, that by this
Means there would be many Thou&s;ands
of Cloths le&s;s exported than the Markets
would otherwi&s;e carry off, to the irrepa|rable
Damage and Di&s;couragement of
Woollen Manufactures, and the Encou|ragement
of the <HI>French;</HI> and the Ruin
of the Clothiers, who, when they had
made large Quantities of Cloth for the
<HI>Turky</HI> Trade, mu&s;t be oblig'd to keep
them on Hand, or, perhaps, &s;ell them
under Price to two or three rich money'd
Men, who make U&s;e of the Nece&s;&s;ities
of the poor Clothiers for that very Ad|vantage;
all which &s;till proclaims them
a Sett of Monopolizers, in the wor&s;t
Sen&s;e of the Word.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">
And this very Practice throws another
Charge back upon them, which they ne|ver
can get off from, and which they now
endeavour to put upon the <HI>Italian</HI> Mer|chants,
<HI>viz.</HI> That whereas they alledge,
that the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants are the Sup|porter
of the <HI>French</HI> Trade to <HI>Turky,</HI> (the
contrary of which is manife&s;t,) the <HI>Turky</HI>
Company, by not duly &s;upplying the
Markets, by laying Mulcts and Re&s;traints
upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth which comes there
by Way of <HI>Leghorn,</HI> by &s;wearing their
Factors and Servants not to &s;ell any of
their Goods, but for pre&s;ent Payment;
whereas the <HI>French</HI> give Credit, where
there is any Certainty or Security of be|ing
paid. By the&s;e, I &s;ay, and many &s;uch
like Methods, they are them&s;elves the
Encouragers, and, indeed, the Supporters
of the <HI>French</HI> Trade to <HI>Turky,</HI> who, on
the contrary, were the Markets con&s;tant|ly
and fully &s;upply'd, and proper Mea|&s;ures
for Trade pur&s;u'd, as would be, if
the Trade were open'd, as it might be,
would not be able to vend one quarter
Part of the Cloth which they now &s;ell
there. I do not mean by this, totally to
lay open the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade, but humbly
hope your Lord&s;hips, in your great Wi&s;|dom,
will put it on the foot the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="30">
Company was, by an Act of the 11^t^h of
King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary;</HI> and I do
believe &s;uch an Act would effectually drive
the <HI>French</HI> out of the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade, and
have the &s;ame effect that had, <HI>viz.</HI> That
in&s;tead of &s;ix or &s;even Sail of Ships the
then <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Company annually employ'd,
and the now <HI>Turky</HI> Company annually em|ploys,
the next Year the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Merchants
&s;ent 40 Sail of Ships, and do now annually
employ above a hundred and twenty, and
our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactories are now carry'd
to Places where before they were never &s;o
much as heard of: And this would be
the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade, were the
<HI>Levant</HI> Company regulated by a like
Act of Parliament; and the Honour
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation kept up with a
much le&s;s Charge on our Manufactures
than it now is; for the Trade being more
diffu&s;ive, half <HI>per Cent.</HI> in&s;tead of two,
would be &s;ufficient to defray the nece&s;&s;ary
National Charge.</P>
<P>So that, in a Word, it is the <HI>Turky</HI>
Company who encourage the <HI>French;</HI> and
many Ways this may be made out: As
for Example, the 23<HI>d</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> 1707, by
laying a Mulct of five Dollars <HI>per</HI> Cloth
on all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth, which comes thither
<PB N="32" REF="31">
from <HI>Leghorn,</HI> when the <HI>French</HI> Cloth
comes in Free, forbidding <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth
from <HI>Leghorn</HI> to come in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships;
but permitting <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships to bring
<HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Cloth Free, as above.
They tell us, if we <HI>&s;top the</HI> French <HI>Silk
from coming hither, we de&s;troy them at
once.</HI> How can they impo&s;e this upon
Mankind, when 'tis known, that all the
Cloth the <HI>French</HI> Merchant can &s;end to
<HI>Turky,</HI> will not &s;upply the Demand they
have for Silk in <HI>France?</HI> But they buy
a great deal with ready Money, as was
the Ca&s;e tho&s;e two Years 1714 and 1715,
when they lo&s;t &s;o much Money by it, as al|mo&s;t
ruin'd them all. And what mu&s;t our
poor Manufacturers have done in <HI>England</HI>
in tho&s;e two Years, had they not been
&s;upply'd by the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchant's buying
that Silk cheap? Is it not evident their
Goods mu&s;t have co&s;t them here 40 <HI>l.
per Cent.</HI> more than the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Itali|ans</HI>
cou'd have imported them at; the
Con&s;equence of which mu&s;t have been,
that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacturers mu&s;t have
been &s;tarv'd, and Wrought Silks, from
all our neighbouring Manufactories, in|&s;tead
of <HI>Turky</HI> Raw Silks, wou'd have
been run in upon us from Abroad.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32">
It is deny'd and has already been ex|plain'd
that <HI>Turky</HI> Raw Silk ever did or
ever can come from <HI>France</HI> hither, by
Way of <HI>Leghorn,</HI> in the ordinary Cour&s;e
of Trade: 'Tis plain, it can never come
but when their Markets in <HI>France</HI> are &s;o
full, and &s;o low, as that they mu&s;t &s;ell
it to great Lo&s;s; or when our Markets,
&s;tarv'd by the Cunning of the Company,
are &s;o extravagantly dear, that to reduce
the Price will be our Gain; &s;o that, in
&s;hort, to bring the <HI>Turky</HI> Silk in either
of tho&s;e two Junctures, will be always to
our Gain, and to the Lo&s;s of the <HI>French.</HI>
And in which of the&s;e two lies the Ad|vantage
to <HI>France,</HI> I would fain have the&s;e
Gentlemen an&s;wer.</P>
<P>But let us examine next, what Di&s;ad|vantage
the <HI>Turky</HI> Company can pretend
to &s;uffer from the <HI>Italian</HI> Trade: Can any
Merchants complain of the Competitors,
who cannot trade under them, but at a
Di&s;advantage of 10 or 12 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and,
if they plea&s;e, 20 or 30 <HI>per Cent.</HI> unle&s;s
Means can be found to evade the Force of
their Impo&s;itions; it cannot be, the Ad|vantage
mu&s;t lie &s;omewhere el&s;e, and it
is manife&s;t it does &s;o, <HI>viz.</HI> in the having
Power, by an exclu&s;ive Trade, to impo&s;e
<PB N="34" REF="33">
other Rates and Prices upon the Markets
Abroad and at Home, than they have ever
yet been able to do: This it is they aim
at, and this they find they can come at
no other Way, but by putting a Stop to
the Merchants &s;ending Cloth to <HI>Turky,</HI> by
Way of <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and bringing back the
Silk to <HI>London;</HI> and this they cannot ex|pect,
but by per&s;wading the World to be|lieve,
than which <HI>nothing can be more
fal&s;e,</HI> that this Silk comes from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Again, to prove the Incon&s;i&s;tence of
this Pretence, I would de&s;ire tho&s;e Mer|chants
to calculate the Price which this
Silk co&s;ts the <HI>French</HI> Merchants in <HI>Turky,</HI>
whether it be bought for Cloth or for
Money; let them add to it the Charges
of carrying fir&s;t to <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> then bring|it
from <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> then &s;hip|ping
it again for <HI>England,</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion in
all tho&s;e Places, and Charges of &s;undry
Sorts, al&s;o In&s;urance, and the like; and
then let them take the Price in <HI>France</HI> and
at <HI>London,</HI> at the &s;ame Time, and tell
us if the <HI>French</HI> gain, or lo&s;e, by the
Trade: If the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> let them prevent it,
by &s;uch legal Methods as they &s;hall think
fit; If the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> which I affirm is true,
what can be the Meaning of &s;o warmly
<PB N="35" REF="34">
engaging again&s;t a Trade which the <HI>French</HI>
lo&s;e Money by.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, in &s;everal of the Ca&s;es given
out by the <HI>Turky</HI> Company, they would
be thought very popular, and claim it of
the World, that they are the great Encou|ragers
of the Woollen Manufacture, and
that they not only export great Quanti|ties,
but that they take all proper Mea|&s;ures
to encourage the Con&s;umption of it
in the Country whither they carry it.</P>
<P>But, were this true, how comes it, that
there are &s;o many By-Laws for the Di&s;|couraging
any one to bring it thither but
them&s;elves; &s;uch as laying a Mulct, or
Duty, of 25 Dollars <HI>per</HI> Bale, upon all
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth that &s;hall come by Way
of <HI>Leghorn,</HI> not allowing it to be brought
in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships, when, at the &s;ame Time,
<HI>as before,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Cloth, <HI>as
I have ob&s;erv'd already,</HI> may come in <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
Bottoms; al&s;o forbidding their Fa|ctors
there to &s;ell any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth, but
for the Company, and the like.</P>
<P>Let any indifferent Per&s;on judge, whe|ther
this is encouraging, or whether it is
not rather a vi&s;ible Combination to di&s;|courage
<PB N="36" REF="35">
and de&s;troy the Trade of our <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
Cloth in <HI>Turky.</HI></P>
<P>With what A&s;&s;urance can the&s;e Men
bring a Rabble of Packers and Cloth-Dre&s;&s;ers,
Clothiers, and Dyers, and other
Mechanicks, up to the Door of the Hou&s;e
to &s;olicit in their Cau&s;e, as if the whole
Manufacture was concern'd? which is
making the poor ignorant Clothworkers
and Manufacturers &s;o many Soliciters a|gain&s;t
them&s;elves, and bringing them to
be Parties to their own De&s;truction, as
Manufacturers.</P>
<P>So al&s;o they bring the Pewterers and
Dealers in Tin; in&s;inuating, that they
are great Benefactors to the Tin-mines;
&s;uppo&s;ing, perhaps, that this may have
&s;ome Influence on &s;uch Members as repre|&s;ent
the Stannary Towns, and who are
&s;uppos'd to have E&s;tates in the Mines of
Tin in the Counties of <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Corn|wal:</HI>
But are they &s;o ignorant as to ima|gine,
that the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Gentlemen do not
know that the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants are
much greater Exporters of Tin than the
<HI>Turky</HI> Merchants, even to above double
the Quantity, and that as well to <HI>Turky</HI>
as <HI>Italy?</HI> Which Things if duly known,
<PB N="37" REF="36">
and if the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants were as much
enclin'd to make them&s;elves popular, and
needeed it as the&s;e Men do, would pre|&s;ently
bring the Manufacturers, Dyers,
Dealers in Tin, and the like, to appear
on their Side, rather than on the other.</P>
<P>But I leave all the&s;e little Things, as
Artifices too mean to be taken Notice of,
and fit only to a&s;&s;i&s;t a bad Cau&s;e. I come
next to enter into the Merit of this Que|&s;tion,
with Regard to the Navigation. It
mu&s;t be of &s;ome Concern to let the World
&s;ee how many Ways this Company, who
value them&s;elves &s;o highly, are an Ob|&s;truction
and Di&s;couragement to our Na|vigation,
and to the employing both Ship|ping
and Seamen, even in this very Trade,
in which they would pretend to recom|mend
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>They were indeed enquir'd of at the
Bar of the Hou&s;e, how many Ships they
employ'd to <HI>Turky</HI> in a Year, and tho'
I hear they an&s;wer'd fal&s;ly, and &s;aid,
Ten; which is more than they employ,
and in &s;ome Years &s;end none at all; yet,
at be&s;t, what Number of Ships is this
to boa&s;t of, or to give them any Claim
to be Encouragers of Navigation?</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37">
On the other hand, the <HI>Italian</HI> Mer|chants
alledge, That they hinder, by
their Limitations upon the Trade, ten
times more Ships being employ'd than all
the Trade they carry on employs. Tho'
they have all the Grand Seigniors Domi|nions
for their Trade, the others only <HI>I|taly,</HI>
they employ 6 or 7 Ships a Year,
the <HI>Italian</HI> Trade near 150, to 200, ma|ny
of which lie mouldring in Port, while
the <HI>French</HI> and other foreign Ve&s;&s;els
(Thanks to the Company's By Laws and
Re&s;trictions) run away with all the
Freights to <HI>Turky,</HI> whil&s;t our Ships, for
want of Employ as u&s;ual in the <HI>Levant,</HI>
are oblig'd to return home Empty.</P>
<P>Which Way &s;hall the&s;e Men be di&s;cours'd
with? Let impartial Men but hear their
Argument: How incoherent! How in|con&s;i&s;tent
with it&s;elf! If they talk of our
Importation to <HI>England,</HI> 'tis exceeding
great. On the other hand, if they talk
of our Exportation from <HI>England,</HI> 'tis ex|ceeding
&s;mall, tho' we vend and &s;end 40
or 50000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth to
<HI>Turky,</HI> by Way of <HI>Leghorn,</HI></P>
<P>If we &s;peak of our Trade to <HI>Turky,</HI>
they tell us, one Ship a Year will bring
<PB N="39" REF="38">
all our Returns, and there is not above
500 Cloths a Year brought into <HI>Turky;</HI>
and yet, at the &s;ame Time, &s;peak of our
Returns as a Thing fatal to their Trade.
To avoid the Ab&s;urdity of the&s;e Things,
they in&s;i&s;t and affirm, That the Silk we
import, is from <HI>France;</HI> offering nothing
to prove it, but their affirming po&s;itively,
that it is &s;o; the Credit of which the
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchants de&s;ire to be excus'd, as
to their giving any Weight to, and as
po&s;itively deny it.</P>
<P>But there is a Way how the <HI>Turky</HI> Mer|chants
may obtain all that they a&s;k'd, and
which, if it may be obtain'd, no Cloth
will be carry'd to <HI>Turky, Vi&acirc; Leghorn,</HI> any
more; and no Raw Silk be brought from
<HI>France, Vi&acirc; Leghorn,</HI> any more; no Cla|mour
again&s;t the <HI>Turky</HI> Company's being
a Monopoly, will be made any more; no
Interruption to our Navigation will be
made by the Company more; but the
Trade will flouri&s;h, the Company will be
enrich'd, and the Nation al&s;o: And this
is but by <HI>laying open the Trade</HI> to all Man|kind,
on the foot of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Company,
to trade freely and unconfin'd; to &s;end
out Ships when they will, and by what
Ways they will; and every body being
<PB N="40" REF="39">
left to pu&s;h their own Trade, there is no
doubt but the Grand Seignior's Domini|ons,
and the Kingdoms and Countries of
<HI>Per&s;ia, Georgia, Armenia,</HI> and the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI>
Sea, might, if Encouragement was given
them, con&s;ume much more <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth
than is now &s;old among them.</P>
<P>This, and no other, is the Way effectu|ally
to encrea&s;e the Trade, to Ruin the
<HI>French</HI> Manufactories of Cloth, and to
encourage both the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacture
and Navigation; and, in this Ca&s;e, a few
Years wou'd bring the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade not to
employ &s;even Ships a Year, but &s;eventy,
and perhaps, &s;even&s;core Ships.</P>
<P>For then wou'd all the Trade be en|courag'd
together, and tho&s;e Ships that
had a Hundred, and perhaps two Hundred
Bales of Cloth on Board, wou'd run away,
take in Freight for other Places, as for
<HI>Genoa, Leghorn, Naples, Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> and &s;o
to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> or <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> and thus,
in&s;tead of few Ships; there wou'd be ma|ny
Sail in a Year employ'd.</P>
<P>And then the Trade wou'd appear, as it
indeed is, very con&s;iderable; whereas now
<PB N="41" REF="40">
tis contracted, 'tis limited; and indeed by
tho&s;e Limitations 'tis almo&s;t quite lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Company is an In&s;tance of
this, who, while they were under the like
Limitations as the <HI>Turky</HI> Company, &s;ent
u&s;ually 6 or 7 Ships a Year to <HI>Archangel,</HI>
whereas they now employ above 120 Sail
of large Ships a Year, one Year with ano|ther;
and they export infinitely more
Woollen Manufactures to that Country,
than ever they did before; and thus pu&s;h|ing
the Trade on with all the Art, and
with the utmo&s;t Diligence, they have
brought Infinite Numbers more of People
to u&s;e the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufacture, than ever
u&s;ed it before.</P>
<P>The like is before us, and the like Ad|vantages
offer them&s;elves; for by this one
Act, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>of laying the Trade open,</HI> In|du&s;try
wou'd have her Hands at liberty,
to &s;truggle and to pu&s;h the Trade into
Countries, and among Inhabitants that
were never heard of before. Methods
wou'd then be u&s;ed by the vigilant Mer|chant,
to &s;end his Goods, and to &s;ell his
Goods, without exacting ready Money
where Payment was &s;ure; leaving the
Factor a di&s;cretionary Power to act as for
him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="41">
As The Trade wou'd thus be better'd,
&s;o the Encouragement to Shipping, the
Encrea&s;e of Seamen, and above all, the
Con&s;umption of our Manufactures wou'd
be enlarg'd, and then the Mock-Complaint
of the Importation of Raw Silk from <HI>Mar|&s;eilles,</HI>
wou'd be at an End; neither wou'd
there be any Occa&s;ion of a Bill to prevent
the Importation of <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Goods from
<HI>Leghorn;</HI> every Merchant having a Li|berty,
in the Cour&s;e of his own Bu&s;ine&s;s,
to bring away the Returns directly.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e as a far greater Number of
Ships wou'd go to <HI>Turky,</HI> having but Part
of their Loading thither, from <HI>England,</HI> and
having the Liberty, to take in Goods for
<HI>Leghorn, Naples,</HI> and <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> in their
Way to <HI>Turky;</HI> &s;o, in their Return, ha|ving
Part of their Loading for <HI>Italy</HI> or
<HI>England,</HI> there being a con&s;tant Trade to
and from <HI>Turky</HI> to <HI>Italy,</HI> the Freight of
which is con&s;iderable, they will be ena|bled
to take the re&s;t of their Loading in
<HI>Italian</HI> Goods at <HI>Me&s;&s;ina, Naples,</HI> or <HI>Leg|ho&s;n,</HI>
as Opportunity pre&s;ents, or as their
Employers direct. So that in this Ca&s;e,
the End of the Act of Navigation, which,
as I &s;aid before, was to encrea&s;e and en|courage
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship|ping,
<PB N="43" REF="42">
e&s;pecially Ships of Force, wou'd
much better be an&s;wer'd, than by carry|ing
on a narrow contracted Trade, as
now they do, manag'd by about thirty
Merchants only; and tho&s;e Thirty ma|nagd
again by Two or Three, by which
the whole Commerce is &s;traighten'd, the
Con&s;umption of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth hinder'd,
and the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> encourag'd to
carry Cloth to <HI>Turky,</HI> and worm us out
of the Trade.</P>
<P>This laying open the Trade may with
Ea&s;e be &s;o regulated, as that the Amba&s;|&s;adors,
Con&s;uls, and other Officers nece&s;|&s;ary
to act there, may be &s;till maintain'd,
and all the nece&s;&s;ary Expences of the
Trade be &s;upply'd, either by the Com|merce
it&s;elf, or by the Publick, for which
&s;uitable Provi&s;ion may be made, as to the
Wi&s;dom of the Parliament &s;hall &s;eem meet.
And for the compleat and ea&s;y Direction
Whereof, a Scheme of &s;uitable Mea&s;ures
&s;hall be pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e, when|ever
&s;uch a Thing &s;hall come upon the
Stage; nor is there any Doubt to be made
but that the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants will be
able to an&s;wer all the Objections that can
be ju&s;tly brought again&s;t &s;uch a Change
of the Company's Con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43">
By the afore&s;aid Ca&s;e (which I think
I have &s;tated impartially) it is humbly
hop'd that the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants, as <HI>En|gli&s;hmen,</HI>
have a natural Right to the
Trade to the Grand Seignier's Dominions.
I &s;hall only give the Heads of &s;ome few
re&s;trictive Orders, and in&s;tance others,
whereby they have Tax'd our Woollen
Manufactures and Navigation, and pro|hibited
even their own Members from
Trading in &s;uch Manner and at &s;uch
Times as they thought proper, and your
Lord&s;hips may then judge, whether a
Company with Power, or a&s;&s;uming a
Power, to make re&s;trictive Laws, be a
Monopoly or not.</P>
