<P>IT is proper to acquaint the reader, before he enters on the following e&s;&s;ays, that they are not thrown together without connection. The fir&s;t, by the inve&s;tigation of a particular fact, is de&s;igned to illu&s;trate the nature of man, as a &s;ocial being. The next con&s;iders him as the &s;ub|ject of morality. And as morality &s;uppo&s;es free|dom of action, this introduces the third e&s;&s;ay, which is a di&s;qui&s;ition on liberty and nece&s;&s;ity. The&s;e make the fir&s;t part of the work. The re&s;t of the e&s;&s;ays, u&s;hered in by that on belief, hang upon each other. A plan is pro&s;ecuted, in &s;up|port of the authority of our &s;en&s;es, external and internal; where it is occa&s;ionally &s;hown, that our rea&s;onings on &s;ome of the mo&s;t important &s;ub|jects, re&s;t ultimately upon &s;en&s;e and feeling. This is illu&s;trated, in a variety of in&s;tances; and from the&s;e, the author would gladly hope, that he has thrown new light upon the principles of human knowledge:&mdash;All to prepare the way, for a proof of the exi&s;tence and perfections of the Deity, which is the chief aim in this un|dertaking.
<PB REF="6">
The author's manner of think|ing, may, in &s;ome points, be e&s;teemed bold and new. But freedom of thought, will not di&s;plea&s;e tho&s;e who are led, in their inquiries, by the love of truth. To &s;uch only he writes: and with &s;uch, he will, at lea&s;t, have the merit of a good aim; of having &s;earched for truth, and endea|voured to promote the cau&s;e of virtue and natu|ral religion.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY I. <HI>Of our</HI> ATTACHMENT <HI>to</HI> OBJECTS <HI>of</HI> DISTRESS.</HEAD>
<P>A NOTED <HI>French</HI> author, who makes critical reflections upon poetry and painting, undertakes a &s;ubject, at|tempted by others un&s;ucce&s;sfully, which is, to account for the &s;trong Attachment we have to Objects of Di&s;tre&s;s, not real objects only, but even fictitious. <Q>It is not ea|&s;y (&s;ays he) to account for the plea&s;ure we take in poetry and painting, which has often a &s;trong re&s;emblance to affliction, and of which the &s;ymptoms are &s;ometimes the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the mo&s;t lively &s;or|row. The arts of poetry and painting are never more applauded than when they &s;ucceed in giving pain. A &s;ecret charm attaches us to repre&s;entations of this na|ture, at the very time our heart, full of angui&s;h, ri&s;es up again&s;t its proper plea&s;ure.
<PB N="2" REF="9">
I dare undertake this paradox, (continues our author) and to explain the foundation of this &s;ort of plea&s;ure which we have in po|etry and painting; an undertaking that may appear bold, if not ra&s;h, &s;eeing it promi&s;es to account to every man for what pa&s;&s;es in his own brea&s;t, and for the &s;ecret &s;prings of his approbation and di&s;like.</Q> Our author is extremely &s;en&s;ible of the difficulty of his &s;ubject; and no wonder, for it has a deep foundation in human nature.</P>
<P>LET us follow him in this difficult under|taking. He lays it down as a preliminary, that our wants and nece&s;&s;ities are our only motives to action, and that in relieving us from them con&s;i&s;ts all natural plea&s;ure: and in this, by the way, he agrees with Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> in his chapter of Power, <HI>&s;ect.</HI> 37. and 43. This account of our natural plea&s;ures &s;hall be afterwards examined. What we have at pre&s;ent to attend to, is the following funda|mental propo&s;ition laid down by our author: <Q>That man by nature is de&s;igned an active
<PB N="3" REF="10">
being: that inaction, whether of body or mind, draws on languor and di&s;gu&s;t; and that this is a cogent motive to fly to any &s;ort of occupation for relief. Thus (adds he) we fly by in&s;tinct to every object that can excite our pa&s;&s;ions, and keep us in agi|tation, not rebuted by the pain &s;uch objects often give us, which cau&s;es vexatious days and &s;leeple&s;s nights: but man, notwith|&s;tanding, &s;uffers more by being without pa&s;&s;ions, than by the agitation they occa&s;i|on.</Q> This is the &s;um of his fir&s;t &s;ection. In the &s;econd he goes on to apply his prin|ciple to particular ca&s;es. The fir&s;t he gives is that of compa&s;&s;ion, whereby we are natu|rally impelled to dwell upon the mi&s;eries and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our fellow creatures, though thereby we come to be partakers of their &s;uf|ferings; an impul&s;e that he ob&s;erves is en|tirely owing to the above principle, which makes us chu&s;e occupation, however painful, rather than be without action. Another is that of publick executions. <Q>We go in crouds (&s;ays he) to a &s;pectacle the mo&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="11">
horrid that man can behold, to &s;ee a poor wretch broke upon the wheel, burnt a|live, or his intrails torn out: the more dreadful the &s;cene, the more numerous the &s;pectators. Yet one might fore&s;ee, even without experience, that the cruel circum&s;tances of the execution, the deep groans and angui&s;h of a fellow creature, mu&s;t make an impre&s;&s;ion, the pain of which is not to be effaced but by a long cour&s;e of time. But the attraction of agi|tation is far more &s;trong upon mo&s;t people, than the joint powers of reflection and experience.</Q> He goes on to mention the &s;trange delight the Roman people had in the entertainments of the amphithe|atre; criminals expo&s;ed to be torn to pieces by wild bea&s;ts, and gladiators in troops &s;et out to butcher one another. He takes this occa|&s;ion to make the following ob&s;ervation upon the Engli&s;h nation: <Q>So tender hearted is that people, that they ob&s;erve humanity towards their greate&s;t criminals. They al|low of no &s;uch thing as torture, alledging
<PB N="5" REF="12">
it better to let a criminal go unpuni&s;hed, than to expo&s;e an innocent per&s;on to tho&s;e torments which are authori&s;ed in other Chri&s;tian countries to extort a confe&s;&s;ion from the guilty. Yet this people, &s;o re&s;pect|ful of their kind, have an infinite plea&s;ure in prize-fighting, bull-beating, and &s;uch other &s;avage &s;pectacles.</Q> He concludes, with &s;howing, that it is this very horror of inac|tion, which makes people every day precipi|tate them&s;elves into play, and deliver them|&s;elves over to cards and dice. <Q>None but fools and &s;harpers (&s;ays he) are moved to play by hope of gain. The generality of mankind are directed by another mo|tive. They neglect tho&s;e diver&s;ions where skill and addre&s;s are required, chu&s;ing ra|ther to ri&s;que their fortunes at games of mere chance, which keep their minds in continual motion, and where every throw is deci&s;ive.</Q></P>
<P>THIS is our author's account of the mat|ter fairly &s;tated. It has, I acknowledge, an air of truth, but the following con&s;iderati|ons
<PB N="6" REF="13">
convince me that is not &s;olid. In the fir&s;t place, if the pain of inaction be the mo|tive which carries us to &s;uch &s;pectacles as are above mentioned, we mu&s;t expect to find them frequented by none but tho&s;e who are oppre&s;t with idlene&s;s. But this will not be found the truth of the matter. All &s;orts of people flock to &s;uch &s;pectacles. Pictures of danger, or of di&s;tre&s;s, have a &s;ecret charm which attracts men from the mo&s;t &s;erious occupations, and operates equally upon the active and the indolent. In the next place, were there nothing in the&s;e &s;pectacles to attract the mind, ab&s;tracting from the pain of inaction, there would be no &s;uch thing as a preference of one object to another, upon any other ground than that of agi|tation; and the more the mind was agi|tated, the greater would be the attraction of the object: but this is contrary to experience. There are many objects of horror and di&s;|ta&s;te, which agitate the mind exceedingly, that even the idle&s;t fly from: and a more apt in|&s;tance need not be given, than what our au|thor
<PB N="7" REF="14">
him&s;elf cites from Livy, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 41.</NOTE> who, &s;peak|ing of Antiochus Epiphanes, has the follow|ing words: <HI>Gladiatorum munus Romanae con|&s;uetudinis prim&ograve; majore cum terrore hominum in&s;uetorum ad tale &s;pectaculum, quam volup|tate dedit. Deinde &s;aepi&ugrave;s dando, et familia|re oculis gratumque id &s;pectaculum fecit, et ar|morum &s;tudium pleri&s;que juvenum accendit.</HI> Such bloody &s;pectacles behoved undoubtedly to make, at fir&s;t, a greater impre&s;&s;ion than af|terwards, when by repetition they were ren|dered familiar: yet this circum&s;tance was &s;o far from being an attraction to the Grecians, that it rai&s;ed in them aver&s;ion and horror. Upon the &s;ame account, the Bear-garden, which is one of the chief entertainments of the Engli&s;h, is held in abhorrence by the French, and other polite nations. It is too &s;avage an entertainment, to be reli&s;hed by tho&s;e of a refined ta&s;te.</P>
<P>IF man is con&s;idered as a being, who&s;e only view, in all his actions, is either to at|tain
<PB N="8" REF="15">
plea&s;ure, or to avoid pain, we mu&s;t con|clude plea&s;ure and pain to be his only im|pul&s;es to action. Upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, it would be hard, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to give any &s;atisfactory account why we &s;hould chu&s;e, with our eyes open, to frequent entertain|ments which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily give us pain. But when we more attentively examine hu|man nature, we di&s;cover many and various impul&s;es to action, independent of plea&s;ure and pain. Let us follow out this thought, becau&s;e it may probably lead to a &s;olution of the problem.</P>
<P>WHEN we attend to the impre&s;&s;ions made by external objects, or to any of our impre&s;|&s;ions, we find few of them &s;o &s;imple as to be altogether without modification. Im|pre&s;&s;ions are either &s;trong or weak, di&s;tinct or confu&s;ed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There is no divi&s;ion of im|pre&s;&s;ions more comprehen&s;ive than into a|greeable or di&s;agreeable. Some &s;light im|pre&s;&s;ions there may be, which give us little or no plea&s;ure, or pain: but the&s;e may be
<PB N="9" REF="16">
neglected in the pre&s;ent inquiry. The bulk of our impre&s;&s;ions may certainly be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed into plea&s;ant and painful. It is un|nece&s;&s;ary, and would perhaps be in vain, to &s;earch for the cau&s;e of this difference a|mong our impre&s;&s;ions. More we cannot &s;ay than that &s;uch is the con&s;titution of our na|ture, &s;o contrived by the Author of all things, in order to an&s;wer wi&s;e and good purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>THERE is another circum&s;tance to be at|tended to in the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions; that <HI>De&s;ire</HI> enters into &s;ome of them, <HI>Aver&s;ion</HI> into others. With regard to &s;ome objects, we feel a de&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and enjoying them: other ob|jects rai&s;e our aver&s;ion, and move us to avoid them. At the &s;ame time, de&s;ire and aver&s;ion are not &s;eparate impre&s;&s;ions, but modificati|ons only; each making a part of the total im|pre&s;&s;ion, rai&s;ed by the agreeable, or di&s;agree|able object. The plea&s;ure, for example, of a fine garden, and the de&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it, are not different impre&s;&s;ions, but only parts of that entire impre&s;&s;ion which is cau&s;ed by the object.
<PB N="10" REF="17">
The impre&s;&s;ion made by any object is one, tho' it may be annalized into parts. It does not belong to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, to inquire in what in&s;tances De&s;ire is rai&s;ed by agreeable objects; for de&s;ire does not accompany a|greeable impre&s;&s;ions in every in&s;tance: but it mu&s;t be carefully attended to, that Aver|&s;ion does not make a part, or enter into the compo&s;ition of every painful impre&s;&s;ion. Ob|jects of horror and terror, loath&s;ome ob|jects, and many others, rai&s;e aver&s;ion. But there are many impre&s;&s;ions, &s;ome of them of the mo&s;t painful &s;ort, which have no de|gree of aver&s;ion in their compo&s;ition. Grief is a mo&s;t painful pa&s;&s;ion or impre&s;&s;ion, and yet is the farthe&s;t of any thing from being mixed with any degree of aver&s;ion. On the contrary, we cling to the object which rai&s;es our grief, and love to dwell upon it. Compa&s;&s;ion is an in&s;tance of the like nature. Objects of di&s;tre&s;s rai&s;e no aver&s;ion in us, tho' they give us pain. De&s;ire always makes a part of the impre&s;&s;ion, de&s;ire to afford re|lief.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="18">
IN infancy, appetite and pa&s;&s;ion, and the de&s;ires and aver&s;ions accompanying them, are our &s;ole impul&s;es to action. But in the progre&s;s of life, when we learn to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the objects around us as contributing to plea&s;ure or pain, we acquire, by degrees, impul&s;es to action of a different &s;ort. Self-love is a &s;trong motive to &s;earch about for every thing that may conduce to happine&s;s. Self-love operates by means of reflection and experience; and every object, &s;o &s;oon as di&s;covered to contribute to our happine&s;s, rai&s;es of cour&s;e a de&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. Hence it is that plea&s;ure and pain are the only mo|tives to action, &s;o far as &s;elf-love is concern|ed. But our appetites and affections, as a|bove explained, are very different in their nature. The&s;e operate by direct impul&s;e, without the intervention of rea&s;on, and an|&s;wer to what is called in&s;tinct in brute crea|tures. As they are not influenced by any &s;ort of rea&s;oning, the view of &s;hunning mi|&s;ery, or acquiring happine&s;s, makes no part of the impul&s;ive cau&s;e. It is true, that the
<PB N="12" REF="19">
gratification of our affections and appetites is for the mo&s;t part attended with plea&s;ure; and it is al&s;o true, that, in giving way to a particular appetite, the view of plea&s;ure may, by a reflex act, become an additional motive to the action. But the&s;e things mu&s;t not be confounded with the direct impul&s;e ari&s;ing from the appetite or affection, which, as I have &s;aid, operates blindly, and in the way of in&s;tinct, without any view to con&s;equen|ces.</P>
<P>AND to a&s;certain the di&s;tinction betwixt actions directed by &s;elf-love, and actions di|rected by particular appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, it mu&s;t be further remarked, that though, for the mo&s;t part, plea&s;ure is the con&s;equence of indulging appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, it is not ne|ce&s;&s;arily, nor indeed univer&s;ally &s;o. If the lat|ter be made out, the former will be evident; becau&s;e there cannot be a nece&s;&s;ary connec|tion betwixt two things, which are in &s;ome in&s;tances &s;eparated. That plea&s;ure is not al|ways the con&s;equence of indulging our ap|petites
<PB N="13" REF="20">
and pa&s;&s;ions, will be plain from induc|tion. Revenge gratified again&s;t the man we hate is attended with plea&s;ure. 'Tis a very different ca&s;e, where we have taken offence at a man we love. Friend&s;hip will not allow me, however offended, to hurt my friend. <Q>I cannot find in my heart to do him mi&s;|chief; but I would have him made &s;en&s;ible of the wrong he has done me.</Q> Revenge, thus denied a vent, recoils and preys upon the vitals of the per&s;on offended. It di&s;plays it&s;elf in peevi&s;hne&s;s and bad humour, which mu&s;t work and ferment, till time, or ac|knowledgment of the wrong, carry it off. This &s;ort of revenge is turned again&s;t the man him&s;elf who is offended; and examples there are of per&s;ons in this petti&s;h humour, working great mi&s;chief to them&s;elves, in order to make the offenders &s;en&s;ible of the wrong. Thus, nothing is more common than to find a young woman, di&s;appointed in love, ready to throw her&s;elf away upon the fir&s;t worth|le&s;s fellow that will ask her the que&s;tion. This indeed is indulging the pa&s;&s;ion of re|venge,
<PB N="14" REF="21">
but without any concomitant plea|&s;ure or &s;atisfaction. Far from it: the great|er the degree of indulgence, the greater the pain. My next in&s;tance will be &s;till more &s;atisfactory. Every one mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that when the pa&s;&s;ion of grief is at its height, the very nature of it is to &s;hun and fly from every thing which tends to give ea&s;e or comfort. He ru&s;hes on to mi&s;ery, by a &s;ort of &s;ympathy with the per&s;on for whom he is grieved. Why &s;hould I be happy when my friend is no more? is the language of this pa&s;&s;ion. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, the man is truly a &s;elf-tormentor. And here we have a &s;ingular phoenomenon in human nature, an appetite after pain, an inclination to ren|der one's &s;elf mi&s;erable. This goes further than even &s;elf-murder; a crime that is ne|ver perpetrated but in order to put an end to mi&s;ery, when it ri&s;es to &s;uch an height as to be in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>WE now &s;ee how imperfect the de&s;cripti|on is of human nature, given by Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="22">
and by our French author. They acknow|ledge no motive to action, but what ari&s;es from &s;elf-love; mea&s;ures laid down to at|tain plea&s;ure, or to &s;hun pain. Our parti|cular appetites and affections, and the de|&s;ires and aver&s;ions involved in them, are left entirely out of the &s;y&s;tem. And yet we may &s;ay, with &s;ome degree of probability, that we are more influenced by the&s;e than by &s;elf-love. We further di&s;cover by this in|quiry, what is of great importance to the &s;ubject in hand, that, as happine&s;s is not al|ways the impul&s;ive motive to action, &s;o nei|ther is it always the effect of an indulged pa&s;&s;ion. Nay, we find this very &s;ingular phoenomenon in human nature a direct ap|petite or de&s;ire, in &s;ome in&s;tances, after pain. So various is human nature, and &s;o compli|cated its acting powers, that it is not readily to be taken in at one view.</P>
<P>AND now we return to our &s;ubject, af|ter having unfolded tho&s;e principles of ac|tion with which it is connected. It may be
<PB N="16" REF="23">
gathered from what is above laid down, that nature, which de&s;igned us for &s;ociety, has connected us &s;trongly together, by a parti|cipation of the joys and mi&s;eries of our fel|low creatures. We have a &s;trong &s;ympa|thy with them; we partake of their afflicti|ons; we grieve with them and for them; and, in many in&s;tances, their misfortunes af|fect us equally with our own. Let it not therefore appear &s;urpri&s;ing, that people, in|&s;tead of &s;hunning objects of mi&s;ery, chu&s;e to dwell upon them; for this is truly as natu|ral as indulging grief for our own misfor|tunes. And it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved at the &s;ame time, that this is wi&s;ely ordered by provi|dence: were the &s;ocial affections mixt with any degree of aver&s;ion, even when we &s;uf|fer under them, we &s;hould be inclined, up|on the fir&s;t notice of an object of di&s;tre&s;s, to drive it from our &s;ight and mind, in&s;tead of affording relief.</P>
<P>NOR ought we to judge of this principle, as any way vitious or faulty: for be&s;ides,
<PB N="17" REF="24">
that it is the great cement of human &s;ocie|ty, we ought to con&s;ider, that, as no &s;tate is exempt from misfortunes, mutual &s;ympa|thy mu&s;t greatly promote the &s;ecurity and happine&s;s of mankind. And 'tis a much more comfortable &s;ituation, that the pro&s;|perity and pre&s;ervation of each individual &s;hould be the care of the whole &s;pecies, than that every man, as the &s;ingle inhabi|tant of a de&s;ert i&s;land, &s;hould be left to &s;tand or fall by him&s;elf, without pro&s;pect of re|gard, or a&s;&s;i&s;tance from others. Nor is this all. When we con&s;ider our own character and actions in a reflex view, we cannot help approving of this tenderne&s;s and &s;ympathy in our nature; we are plea&s;ed with our&s;elves for being &s;o con&s;tituted, we are con&s;cious of inward merit; and this is a continual &s;ource of &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>To open this &s;ubject a little further, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that naturally we have a &s;trong de&s;ire to be acquainted with the hi&s;tory of our fellow creatures. We judge of their ac|tions,
<PB N="18" REF="25">
approve or di&s;approve, condemn or acquit; and in this the bu&s;y mind has a won|derful delight. Nay, we go further. We enter deep into their concerns, take a &s;ide; we partake of joys and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, with tho&s;e we favour, and &s;how a proportional aver&s;ion to others. This turn of mind makes hi&s;to|ry, novels and plays the mo&s;t univer&s;al and favourite entertainments. And indeed this is no more than what is to be expected from man as a &s;ociable creature; and we may venture to affirm, that the mo&s;t &s;ociable have the greate&s;t &s;hare of this &s;ort of curio&s;ity, and the &s;tronge&s;t attachment to &s;uch en|tertainments.</P>
<P>TRAGEDY is an imitation or repre&s;enta|tion of human characters and actions. 'Tis a feigned hi&s;tory which generally makes a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion, than what is real; be|cau&s;e, if it be a work of genius, incidents will be cho&s;en to make the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;i|ons, and will be &s;o conducted, as to keep the mind in continual &s;u&s;pen&s;e and agitation,
<PB N="19" REF="26">
beyond what commonly happens in real life. By a well wrought tragedy, all the &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions are rou&s;ed. The fir&s;t &s;cene is &s;carce ended before we are engaged. We take a &s;udden affection to &s;ome of the per&s;onages repre&s;ented. We come to be attached to them as to our bo&s;om-friends, and hope and fear for them, as if the whole were a true hi&s;tory, in&s;tead of a fable.</P>
<P>To a dry philo&s;opher, unacquainted with theatrical entertainments, it may appear &s;ur|pri&s;ing, that imitation &s;hould have &s;uch an effect upon the mind, and that the want of truth and reality &s;hould not prevent the operation of our pa&s;&s;ions. But whatever may be the phy&s;ical cau&s;e, one thing is evi|dent, that this aptitude of the mind of man, to receive impre&s;&s;ions from feigned, as well as from real objects, contributes to the no|ble&s;t purpo&s;es of life. Nothing conduces &s;o much to improve the mind, and confirm it in virtue, as being continually employed in &s;urveying the actions of others, entering into
<PB N="20" REF="27">
the concerns of the virtuous, approving of their conduct, condemning vice, and &s;how|ing an abhorrence at it; for the mind ac|quires &s;trength by exerci&s;e, as well as the body. But were there no opportunity for this &s;ort of di&s;cipline, but from &s;cenes of re|al life, the generality of men would be little the better for it, becau&s;e &s;uch &s;cenes do but rarely occur. They are not frequent even in hi&s;tory. But, in compo&s;itions where li|berty is allowed of fiction, it mu&s;t be want of genius, if the mind is not &s;ufficiently exerci&s;ed, till it acquire the greate&s;t &s;en&s;ibi|lity, and the mo&s;t confirmed habits of vir|tue.</P>
<P>Thus, tragedy engages our affections, not le&s;s than true hi&s;tory. Friend&s;hip, concern for the virtuous, abhorrence of the vitious, compa&s;&s;ion, hope, fear, and the whole train of the &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions, are rou&s;ed and exer|ci&s;ed by both of them equally.</P>
<P>THIS may appear to be a fair account of the attachment we have to theatrical en|tertainments:
<PB N="21" REF="28">
but when the &s;ubject is more narrowly examined, &s;ome difficulties occur, to which the principles above laid down will &s;carce afford a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. 'Tis no wonder that young people flock to &s;uch en|tertainments. The love of novelty, de&s;ire of occupation, beauty of action, are &s;trong attractions: and if one is once engaged, of whatever age, by entering into the intere&s;ts of the per&s;onages repre&s;ented, the attraction turns &s;trong beyond mea&s;ure, and the &s;tory mu&s;t be followed out, whatever be the con|&s;equence. The fore&s;ight of running one's &s;elf into grief and affliction will not di&s;en|gage. But people generally turn wi&s;e by experience; and it may appear &s;urpri&s;ing, when di&s;tre&s;s is the never failing effect of &s;uch entertainments, that per&s;ons of riper judgment &s;hould not &s;hun them altogether. Does &s;elf-love ly a&s;leep in this ca&s;e, which is for ordinary &s;o active a principle? When one con&s;iders the matter <HI>a priori,</HI> he will not he&s;itate to draw a conclu&s;ion to this pur|po&s;e, that as repeated experience mu&s;t, at the
<PB N="22" REF="29">
long run, make us wi&s;e enough to keep out of harm's way; deep tragedies, for that rea|&s;on, will be little frequented by per&s;ons of reflexion. Yet the contrary is true in fact; the deepe&s;t tragedies being the mo&s;t fre|quented by per&s;ons of all ages, e&s;pecially by tho&s;e of delicate feelings, upon whom the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ions are made. A man of that character, who has &s;carce got the better of the deep di&s;tre&s;s he was thrown into the night before by a well acted tragedy, does, in his clo&s;et, coolly and deliberately re&s;olve to go to the next entertainment of the kind, without feeling the &s;malle&s;t ob&s;truction from &s;elf-love.</P>
<P>THIS leads to a &s;peculation, perhaps one of the mo&s;t curious that belongs to human nature. Contrary to what is generally un|der&s;tood, the above is a palpable proof, that even &s;elf-love does not always operate to a|void pain and di&s;tre&s;s. In examining how this is brought about, there will be di&s;cover|ed an admirable contrivance in human na|ture,
<PB N="23" REF="30">
to give free &s;cope to the &s;ocial affecti|ons. Let us review what is above laid down: in the fir&s;t place, that of the painful pa&s;&s;i|ons, &s;ome are accompanied with aver&s;ion, &s;ome with de&s;ire: in the next place, that of the painful pa&s;&s;ions, accompanied with de|&s;ire, the gratification of &s;ome produces plea|&s;ure, &s;uch as hunger and thir&s;t, revenge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> others pain and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;uch as grief. Now, upon the &s;tricte&s;t examination, the follow|ing propo&s;ition will be found to hold true in fact; that the painful pa&s;&s;ions, which, in the direct feeling, are free from any degree of aver&s;ion, have as little of it in the reflex act. Or, to expre&s;s the thing more familiar|ly, when we reflect upon the pain we have &s;uffered by our concern for others, there is no degree of aver&s;ion mixt with the reflecti|on, more than with the pain it&s;elf, which is the immediate effect of the object. For illu&s;tration's &s;ake, let us compare the pain which ari&s;es from compa&s;&s;ion with any bo|dily pain. Cutting one's fle&s;h is not only accompanied with &s;trong aver&s;ion in the di|rect
<PB N="24" REF="31">
feeling, but with an aver&s;ion equally &s;trong in reflecting upon the action after|wards. We feel no &s;uch aver&s;ion in reflect|ing upon the mental pains above de&s;cribed. On the contrary, when we reflect upon the pain which the misfortune of a friend gave us, the reflection is accompanied with an eminent degree of &s;atisfaction. We approve of our&s;elves for &s;uffering with our friend, value our&s;elves the more for that &s;uffering, and are ready to undergo chearfully the like di&s;tre&s;s upon the like occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>WHEN we examine tho&s;e particular pa&s;&s;i|ons, which though painful, not only in the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, but al&s;o in the gratification, if I may call it &s;o, are yet accompanied with no aver&s;ion; we find they are all of the &s;ocial kind, ari&s;ing from that eminent principle of &s;ympathy, which is the cement of human &s;ociety. The &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions are accompanied with appetite for indulgence, when they give us pain, not le&s;s than when they give us plea&s;ure. We &s;ubmit willingly
<PB N="25" REF="32">
to &s;uch painful pa&s;&s;ions, and reckon it no hard&s;hip to &s;uffer under them. In this con|&s;titution, we have the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of regu|larity and order, and that it is right and meet we &s;hould &s;uffer after this manner. Thus the moral affections, even &s;uch of them as produce pain, both in the fir&s;t feel|ing, and in the indulgence of the pa&s;&s;ion, are none of them attended with any degree of aver&s;ion, not even in reflecting upon the di&s;tre&s;s they often bring us under. And this ob&s;ervation tends to &s;et the moral affections in a very di&s;tingui&s;hed point of view, in op|po&s;ition to tho&s;e that are either malevolent, or merely &s;elfi&s;h.</P>
<P>Many and admirable are the &s;prings of action in human nature, and not one more admirable than what is now unfolded. Com|pa&s;&s;ion is a mo&s;t valuable principle, which connects people in &s;ociety by ties &s;trong|er than tho&s;e of blood. Yet compa&s;&s;i|on is a painful emotion, and is often ac|companied with pain in the indulgence. Were it accompanied with any degree of a|ver&s;ion,
<PB N="26" REF="33">
even in reflecting upon the di&s;tre&s;s it occa&s;ions, after the di&s;tre&s;s is over, that aver&s;ion would, by degrees, blunt the pa&s;&s;i|on, and at length cure us of what we would be apt to reckon a weakne&s;s or di&s;ea&s;e. But the author of our nature has not left his work imperfect. He has given us this noble principle entire, without a counter-balance, &s;o as to have a vigorous and univer&s;al opera|tion. Far from having any aver&s;ion to pain, occa&s;ioned by the &s;ocial principles, we re|flect upon &s;uch pain with &s;atisfaction, and are willing to &s;ubmit to it upon all occa&s;i|ons with chearfulne&s;s and heart-liking, ju&s;t as much as if it were a real plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>AND now the cau&s;e of the attachment we have to Tragedy is fairly laid open, and comes out in the &s;tronge&s;t light. The &s;oci|al pa&s;&s;ions, put in motion by it, are often the occa&s;ion of di&s;tre&s;s to the &s;pectators. But our nature is &s;o happily con&s;tituted, that di&s;tre&s;s, occa&s;ioned by the exerci&s;e of the &s;o|cial pa&s;&s;ions, is not an object of the &s;mall|e&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="34">
aver&s;ion to us, even when we reflect coolly and deliberately upon it. Self-love does not carry us to &s;hun affliction of this &s;ort. On the contrary, we are &s;o fram|ed, as willingly and chearfully to &s;ubmit to it upon all occa&s;ions, as if it were a real and &s;ub&s;tantial good. And, thus, Tragedy is al|lowed to &s;eize the mind with all the diffe|rent charms which ari&s;e from the exerci&s;e of the &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions, without the lea&s;t ob&s;tacle from &s;elf-love.</P>
<P>HAD our author reflected on the &s;ym|pathi&s;ing principle, by which we are led, as by a &s;ecret charm, to partake of the mi&s;eries of others, he would have had no occa&s;ion of recurring to &s;o imperfect a principle as that of aver&s;ion to inaction, to explain this &s;eem|ing paradox, that a man &s;hould voluntarily chu&s;e to give him&s;elf pain. Without enter|ing deep into philo&s;ophy, he might have had hints in abundance from common life to explain it. In every corner, per&s;ons are to be met with of &s;uch a &s;ympathi&s;ing tem|per,
<PB N="28" REF="35">
as to chu&s;e to &s;pend their lives with the di&s;ea&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. They partake with them in their afflictions, enter heartily into their concerns, and &s;igh and groan with them. The&s;e pa&s;s their lives in &s;adne&s;s and de&s;pondency, without having any other &s;atis|faction than what ari&s;es upon the reflection of having done their duty.</P>
<P>AND if this account of the matter be ju&s;t, we may be a&s;&s;ured, that tho&s;e who are mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate in their temper will be fonde&s;t of Tragedy, which affords them a large field for indulging the pa&s;&s;ion. And indeed admirable are the effects brought a|bout by this means: for, pa&s;&s;ions as they gather &s;trength by indulgence, &s;o they de|cay by want of exerci&s;e. Per&s;ons in pro|&s;perity, unacquainted with di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;e|ry, are apt to grow hard-hearted. Tragedy is an admirable re&s;ource in &s;uch a ca&s;e. It &s;erves to humanize the temper, by &s;upplying feigned objects of pity, which have nearly the &s;ame effect to exerci&s;e the pa&s;&s;ion that
<PB N="29" REF="36">
real objects have. And thus it is, that we are carried by a natural impul&s;e to deal deep in affliction, occa&s;ioned by repre&s;enta|tions of feigned misfortunes; and the pa&s;&s;i|on of pity alone would make us throng to &s;uch repre&s;entations, were there nothing el&s;e to attract the mind, or to afford &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>IT is owing to curio&s;ity, that public ex|ecutions are &s;o much frequented. Sen&s;ible people endeavour to correct an appetite, which, upon indulgence, gives pain and a|ver&s;ion, and, upon reflection, is attended with no degree of &s;elf-approbation. Hence it is, that &s;uch &s;pectacles are the entertain|ment of the vulgar chiefly, who allow them|&s;elves blindly to be led by the pre&s;ent in|&s;tinct, with little attention whether it be conducive to their good or not.</P>
<P>AND as for prize-fighting and gladiatori|an &s;hows, nothing animates and in&s;pires us more than examples of courage and bravery. We catch the &s;pirit of the actor, and turn
<PB N="30" REF="37">
bold and intrepid as he appears to be. On the other hand, we enter into the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the vanqui&s;hed, and have a &s;ympathy for them in proportion to the gallantry of their behaviour. No wonder then, that &s;uch &s;hows are frequented by per&s;ons of the be&s;t ta&s;te. We are led by the &s;ame principle, that makes us fond of peru&s;ing the lives of heroes and of conquerors. And it may be ob&s;erved by-the-by, that &s;uch &s;pectacles have an admirable good effect in training up the youth to boldne&s;s and re&s;olution. In this, therefore, I &s;ee not that foreigners have rea|&s;on to condemn the Engli&s;h ta&s;te. Spec|tacles of this &s;ort de&s;erve encouragement from the &s;tate, and to be made an object of public policy.</P>
<P>As for gaming, I cannot bring my&s;elf to think that there is any plea&s;ure in having the mind kept in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and as it were upon the rack, which mu&s;t be the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who venture their money at games of hazard. Inaction and idlene&s;s are not by
<PB N="31" REF="38">
far &s;o hard to bear. I am &s;atisfied that the love of money is at the bottom. Nor is it a &s;olid objection, that people will neglect games of skill and addre&s;s, to venture their money at hazard; for this may be owing to indo|lence, diffidence, or impatience. There is indeed a curious &s;peculation with regard to this article of gaming, that plea&s;ure and pain attend good and bad &s;ucce&s;s at play, inde|pendent of the money lo&s;t or win. It is a plain ca&s;e, that good luck rai&s;es our &s;pirits, as bad luck depre&s;&s;es them, without regard to con&s;equences: and it &s;eems extremely clear, that our concern at game, when we play for trifles, is owing to this very thing. What may be the root of this affection, is not &s;o obvious. But as it is not nece&s;&s;arily connected with our pre&s;ent theme, I &s;hall leave it to be inve&s;tigated by others.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>SUPERFICIAL knowledge produces the bolde&s;t adventurers, becau&s;e it gives no check to the imagination, when fired by a new thought. Writers of this &s;tamp lay down plans, contrive models, and are hurried on to execution, by the plea&s;ure of novelty, without con&s;idering whether, after all, there is any &s;olid foundation to &s;upport the &s;pacious edifice. It redounds not a little to the honour of &s;ome late inquirers after truth, that, &s;ubduing this bent of nature, they have &s;ubmitted to the &s;low and more painful &s;tudy of facts and experiments. Na|tural philo&s;ophy, in all its branches, is ad|vanced by this laborious method. The ac|curate Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> has pur&s;ued the &s;ame track in the &s;cience of logicks, and has been followed by &s;everal ingenious writers. But
<PB N="34" REF="40">
it &s;eems to fare hard with the mi&s;tre&s;s-&s;ci|ence, that le&s;s deference is paid to her than to her hand-maids. Every author exhibits a &s;y&s;tem of morals, &s;uch as be&s;t &s;uits his ta&s;te and fancy. He frames regulations for human conduct, without con&s;idering whe|ther they ari&s;e out of human nature, or can be accommodated to it. And hence many airy &s;y&s;tems that relate not more to man, than to many other beings. Authors of a warm imagination, and benevolent turn of mind, exalt man to the angelic nature, and compo&s;e laws for his conduct, &s;o refin'd as to be far above the reach of humanity. Others of a contrary di&s;po&s;ition, forcing down all men to a level with the very lowe&s;t of their kind, a&s;&s;ign them laws more &s;uitable to brutes than to rational beings. In ab&s;tract &s;cience, philo&s;ophers may more innocently indulge their fancies. The wor&s;t that can happen is, to mi&s;lead us in matters where error has little influence on practice: but they who deal in moral philo&s;ophy ought to be cauti|ous, for their errors &s;eldom fail to have a
<PB N="35" REF="41">
bad tendency. The exalting of nature a|bove its &s;tandard is apt to di&s;gu&s;t the mind, con&s;cious of its weakne&s;s, and of its inabili|ty to attain &s;uch an uncommon degree of perfection. The deba&s;ing of nature tends to break the balance of the affections, by add|ing weight to the &s;elfi&s;h and irregular appe|tites. A cruel effect this, but not the only bad one. The many cla&s;hing opinions a|bout morality are apt to tempt readers, who have any hollowne&s;s of heart, to &s;hake off all principles, and to give way to every ap|petite as it comes uppermo&s;t: and then adieu to a ju&s;t tenor of life, and con&s;i&s;tency of conduct.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations give the author of this e&s;&s;ay a ju&s;t concern to proceed with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection in his inquiries, and to try his conclu&s;ions by their true touch|&s;tone, that of facts and experiments. Had this method been &s;trictly followed, the world would not have been perplexed with many various and incon&s;i&s;tent &s;y&s;tems, which un|happily
<PB N="36" REF="42">
have rendered morality a difficult and intricate &s;cience. An attempt to re&s;tore it to its original &s;implicity and authority, mu&s;t be approved of, however &s;hort one falls in the execution. Authors differ about the origin of the laws of nature, and they differ about the laws them&s;elves. It will perhaps be found, that there is le&s;s diffe|rence about the former in reality, than in appearance. It were to be wi&s;hed, that the different opinions about the latter could be as happily reconciled. But as the author ac|knowledges this to be above his reach, he mu&s;t take up with a le&s;s agreeable task, which is to attempt a plan of the laws of na|ture, drawn from their proper &s;ource, with|out regarding authority.</P>

<PB N="37" REF="43">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of the</HI> FOUNDATION <HI>of the</HI> LAW <HI>of</HI> NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>IN &s;earching for the foundation of the laws of our nature, the following re|flections readily occur. In the fir&s;t place, two things cannot be more intimately con|nected than a being and its actions; for the connection is that of cau&s;e and effect: &s;uch as the being is, &s;uch mu&s;t its actions be. In the next place, the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es into which nature has di&s;tributed living creatures, are not more di&s;tingui&s;hable by an external form, than by an internal con&s;titution, which ma|nife&s;ts it&s;elf in a certain uniformity of con|duct, peculiar to each &s;pecies. In the third place, any action, conformable to the com|mon nature of the &s;pecies, is con&s;idered by us as regular and good: it is acting accord|ing to order, and according to nature. But if there exi&s;ts a being, with a con&s;titution different from that of its kind, the actions of this being, tho' agreeable to its own pe|culiar
<PB N="38" REF="44">
con&s;titution, will, to us, appear whim|&s;ical and di&s;orderly: we &s;hall have a feeling of di&s;gu&s;t, as if we &s;aw a man with two heads or four hands. The&s;e reflections lead us to the foundation of the laws of our nature. They are to be derived from the common nature of man, of which every per&s;on par|takes who is not a mon&s;ter.</P>
<P>BUT as the above conclu&s;ion is the ground|work of all morality, it may not be improper to be&s;tow a few more words upon it. Look|ing around, we find creatures of very diffe|rent kinds, both as to their external and in|ternal con&s;titutions. Each &s;pecies having a peculiar nature, mu&s;t have a peculiar rule of action re&s;ulting from its nature. We find this to hold in fact; and it is extreme agree|able to ob&s;erve how accurately the laws of each &s;pecies, ari&s;ing from its nature, are ad|ju&s;ted to its external frame, and to the cir|cum&s;tances in which it is placed, &s;o as to procure the conveniencies of life in the be&s;t manner, and to produce regularity and con|&s;i&s;tency
<PB N="39" REF="45">
of conduct. To give but one in|&s;tance. The laws, which govern &s;ociable creatures, differ widely from tho&s;e which govern the &s;avage and &s;olitary. Nothing more natural nor more orderly among &s;oli|tary creatures, who have no mutual connec|tion, than to make food one of another. But for creatures in &s;ociety to live after this manner, behoved to be the effect of jarring and incon&s;i&s;tent principles. No &s;uch di&s;or|derly appearance is to be met with upon the face of this globe. There is, as above ob|&s;erved, a harmony betwixt the internal and external con&s;titution of the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of animals; and this harmony obtains &s;o uni|ver&s;ally, as to afford a delightful pro&s;pect of deep de&s;ign regularly carried into execution. The common nature of every cla&s;s of be|ings is felt by us as perfect; and, therefore, if, in any in&s;tance, a particular being &s;werve from the common nature of its kind, the action upon that account is accompanied with a &s;en&s;e of di&s;order and wrong. Thus, as we have a &s;en&s;e of right from every ac|tion,
<PB N="40" REF="46">
which is conformable to this common nature, the laws, which ought to govern every animal, are to be derived from no other &s;ource than the common nature of the &s;pecies. In a word, it is according to order, that the different &s;orts of living crea|tures &s;hould be governed by laws adapted to their peculiar nature. We con&s;ider it as fit and proper that it &s;hould be &s;o; and it is a beautiful &s;cene to find creatures acting ac|cording to their nature, and thereby act|ing uniformly, and according to a ju&s;t te|nor of life.</P>
<P>THE force of this rea&s;oning cannot, at any rate, be re&s;i&s;ted by tho&s;e who admit of final cau&s;es. We make no difficulty to pro|nounce, that a &s;pecies of beings are made for &s;uch and &s;uch an end, who are of &s;uch and &s;uch a nature. A lion is made to pur|cha&s;e the means of life by his claws. Why? becau&s;e &s;uch is his nature and con&s;titution. A man is made to purcha&s;e the means of life by the help of others, in &s;ociety. Why?
<PB N="41" REF="47">
becau&s;e, from the con&s;titution both of his body and mind, he cannot live comfortably but in &s;ociety. It is thus we di&s;cover for what end we were de&s;igned by nature, or the author of nature; and the &s;ame chain of rea&s;oning points out to us the laws by which we ought to regulate our actions. For, acting according to nature, is acting &s;o, as to an&s;wer the end of our creation.</P>

<PB N="42" REF="48">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the</HI> MORAL SENSE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;hown that the nature of man is the only foundation of the laws that ought to govern his actions, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to trace out human nature with all the accuracy po&s;&s;ible, &s;o far as regards the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. If we can happily ac|compli&s;h this undertaking, it will be ea&s;y, in the &s;ynthetical method, to deduce the laws which ought to regulate our conduct. And we &s;hall examine, in the fir&s;t place, after what manner we are related to beings and things about us; for this &s;peculation will lead to the point in view.</P>
<P>As we are placed in a great world, &s;ur|rounded with beings and things, &s;ome bene|ficial, others hurtful; we are &s;o con&s;tituted, that &s;carce any of the objects of perception are indifferent to us. They either give us plea&s;ure or pain. Sounds, ta&s;tes, and &s;mells, are either agreeable or di&s;agreeable. And
<PB N="43" REF="49">
the thing is mo&s;t of all remarkable is the ob|jects of &s;ight, which affect us in a more live|ly manner than the objects of any other ex|ternal &s;en&s;e. Thus, a &s;preading oak, a ver|dant plain, a large river, are objects which afford great delight. A rotten carca&s;e, a di&s;|torted figure, create aver&s;ion, which, in &s;ome in&s;tances, goes the length of horror.</P>
<P>WITH regard to objects of &s;ight, what|ever gives plea&s;ure, is &s;aid to be <HI>Beautiful;</HI> whatever gives pain, is &s;aid to be <HI>Ugly.</HI> The terms <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Ugline&s;s,</HI> in their original &s;ignification, are confined to objects of &s;ight: and indeed &s;uch objects, being more highly agreeable or di&s;agreeable than o|thers, de&s;erve well to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a proper name. But tho' this is the proper meaning of the terms Beauty and Ugline&s;s, yet, as it happens with words which convey a more lively idea than ordinary, the terms are applied in a figurative &s;en&s;e to almo&s;t every thing which carries a high reli&s;h or di&s;gu&s;t, tho' not the object of &s;ight, where
<PB N="44" REF="50">
the&s;e feelings have not a proper name of their own. Thus, we talk of a beautiful theorem, a beautiful thought, and a beauti|ful action. And this way of &s;peaking has, by common u&s;e, become &s;o familiar, that it is &s;carce reckoned a figurative expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE plea&s;ure and pain which ari&s;e from objects con&s;idered &s;imply as exi&s;ting, with|out relation to any end propo&s;ed, or any de|&s;igning agent, are to be placed in the lowe&s;t rank or order of Beauty and Ugline&s;s. But when external objects, &s;uch as works of art, are con&s;idered with relation to &s;ome end propo&s;ed, we feel a higher degree of plea|&s;ure or pain. Thus, a building regular in all its parts, plea&s;es the eye, upon the very fir&s;t view. But con&s;idered as a hou&s;e for dwell|ing in, which is the end propo&s;ed, it plea|&s;es &s;till more, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be well fit|ted to its end.

THIS perception of Beauty in works of art or de&s;ign, which is produced not barely by a &s;ight of the object, but by viewing the object in a certain light, as fitted to &s;ome u&s;e, and as related to &s;ome end, includes in it what is termed <HI>Approbation:</HI> for approbati|on, when applied to works of art, means, preci&s;ely, our being plea&s;ed with them, or conceiving them beautiful in the view of being fitted to their end. <HI>Approbation</HI> and <HI>Di&s;approbation</HI> do not apply to the fir&s;t or lowe&s;t cla&s;s of beautiful and ugly objects. To &s;ay that we approve of a &s;weet ta&s;te, or of a flowing river, is really &s;aying no more, than barely that we are plea&s;ed with &s;uch objects. But the term is ju&s;tly applied to works of art, becau&s;e it means more than being plea&s;ed with &s;uch an object merely as exi&s;ting. It imports a peculiar beauty, which is perceived upon con&s;idering the object as fitted to the u&s;e intended.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be further ob&s;erved, to avoid ob|&s;curity, that the beauty, which ari&s;es from the
<PB N="46" REF="52">
relation of an object to its end, is indepen|dent of the end it&s;elf, whether good or bad, whether beneficial or hurtful: for the feel|ing ari&s;es merely from con&s;idering its fitne&s;s to the end propo&s;ed, whatever that end be.</P>
<P>WHEN we take the end it&s;elf under con|&s;ideration, there is di&s;covered a di&s;tinct mo|dification of Beauty and Ugline&s;s, of a high|er kind than the two former. A beneficial end propo&s;ed, &s;trikes us with a very peculi|ar plea&s;ure; and approbation belongs al&s;o to this feeling. Thus, the mechani&s;m of a &s;hip is beautiful, in the view of means well fitted to an end. But the end it&s;elf of car|rying on commerce, and procuring &s;o many conveniencies to mankind, exalts the object, and heightens our approbation and plea&s;ure. By an End, I mean, that to which any thing is fitted, which it &s;erves to procure and bring about, whether it be an ultimate end, or &s;ub|ordinate to &s;omething further. Hence, what is con&s;idered as an end in one view, may be con&s;idered as a means in another. But
<PB N="47" REF="53">
&s;o far as it is con&s;idered as an end, the de|gree of its Beauty depends upon the degree of its u&s;efulne&s;s. The feeling of Approba|tion here terminates upon the thing it&s;elf in many in&s;tances, ab&s;tracted from the intention of an agent; which intention, coming into view as good or bad, gives ri&s;e to a modifica|tion of Beauty or Deformity, different from tho&s;e above &s;et forth, as &s;hall be pre&s;ently explained. Let it be only kept in view, that, as the end or u&s;e of a thing is an object of greater dignity and importance than the means, the approbation be&s;towed on the former ri&s;es higher than that be&s;towed on the latter.</P>
<P>THESE three orders of Beauty may be blended together in many different ways, to have very different effects. If an object, in it&s;elf beautiful, be ill fitted to its end, it will, upon the whole, be di&s;agreeable. This may be exemplified, in a hou&s;e regular in its architecture, and beautiful to the eye, but incommodious for dwelling. If there
<PB N="48" REF="54">
is in an object an aptitude to a bad end, it will, upon the whole, be di&s;agreeable, tho' it have the &s;econd modification of beau|ty in the greate&s;t perfection. A con&s;tituti|on of government, formed with the mo&s;t perfect art for en&s;laving the people, may be an in&s;tance of this. If the end propo&s;ed is good, but the object not well fitted to the end, it will be beautiful or ugly, as the goodne&s;s of the end, or unfitne&s;s of the means, are prevalent. Of this, in&s;tances will occur at fir&s;t view, without being &s;ug|ge&s;ted.</P>
<P>THE above modifications of beauty and deformity, apply to all objects animate and inanimate. A voluntary agent is an object which produces a peculiar modification of beauty and deformity, which may readily be di&s;tingui&s;hed in the feeling from all o|thers. The actions of living creatures are more intere&s;ting than the actions of matter. The in&s;tincts, and principles of action of the former, give us more delight than the blind
<PB N="49" REF="55">
powers of the latter, or, in other words, are more beautiful. No one can doubt of this fact, who is in any degree conver&s;ant with the poets. In Homer every thing lives. Even darts and arrows are endued with vo|luntary motion. And we are &s;en&s;ible, that nothing animates a poem more than the frequent u&s;e of this figure.</P>
<P>AND hence a new modification of the beauty and deformity of actions, con&s;ider|ed as proceeding from intention, deliberati|on and choice. This modification, which is of the utmo&s;t importance in the &s;cience of morals, concerns principally human actions; for we di&s;cover little of intention, delibera|tion and choice in the actions of inferior creatures. Human actions are not only a|greeable or di&s;agreeable, beautiful or deform|ed, in the different views above mentioned, but are further di&s;tingui&s;hed in our feeling, as <HI>fit, right</HI> and <HI>meet</HI> to be done, or as <HI>un|fit, unmeet</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> to be done. The&s;e are &s;imple feelings, capable of no definition, and
<PB N="50" REF="56">
which cannot otherways be explained, than by making u&s;e of the words that are appro|priated to them. But let any man atten|tively examine what pa&s;&s;es in his mind, when the object of his thought is an action proceeding from deliberate intention, and he will &s;oon di&s;cover the meaning of the&s;e words, and the feelings which they denote. Let him but attend to a deliberate action &s;ugge&s;ted by filial piety, or one &s;ugge&s;ted by gratitude; &s;uch actions will not only be agree|able to him, and appear beautiful, but will be agreeable and beautiful as <HI>fit, right</HI> and <HI>meet</HI> to be done. He will approve of the action in that quality, and he will approve of the actor for having done his duty. This pecu|liar feeling, or modification of beauty and deformity in human actions, is known by the name of <HI>moral beauty,</HI> and <HI>moral de|formity.</HI> In it con&s;i&s;ts the <HI>morality</HI> and <HI>immorality</HI> of human actions; and the pow+er or faculty, by which we perceive this dif|ference among actions, pa&s;&s;es under the name of the <HI>moral &s;en&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="57">
IT is but a &s;uperficial account which is given of morality by mo&s;t writers, that it depends upon Approbation and Di&s;appro|bation. For it is evident, that the&s;e terms are applicable to works of art, and to ob|jects beneficial and hurtful, as well as to morality. It ought further to have been ob|&s;erved, that the approbation or di&s;approba|tion of actions, are feelings, very di&s;tingui&s;h|able from what relate to the objects now mentioned. Some actions are approved of as good and as fit, right and meet to be done; others are di&s;approved of as bad and unfit, unmeet and wrong to be done. In the one ca&s;e, we approve of the actor as a good man; in the other, di&s;approve of him as a bad man. The&s;e feelings don't apply to ob|jects as fitted to an end, nor even to the end it&s;elf, except as proceeding from delibe|rate intention. When a piece of work is well executed, we approve of the artificer for his skill, not for his goodne&s;s. Several things inanimate, as well as animate, &s;erve to extreme good ends. We approve of the&s;e ends as u&s;eful in them&s;elves, but not as mo|rally
<PB N="52" REF="58">
fit and right, where they are not con|&s;idered as the re&s;ult of intention.</P>
<P>OF all objects whatever, human actions are the mo&s;t highly delightful or di&s;gu&s;tful, and afford the greate&s;t degree of beauty or deformity. In the&s;e every modification con|curs: the fitne&s;s or unfitne&s;s of the means: the goodne&s;s or badne&s;s of the end: the intention of the actor, which gives them the peculiar character of <HI>fit, right</HI> and <HI>meet,</HI> or <HI>unfit, wrong</HI> and <HI>unmeet.</HI></P>
<P>THUS we find the nature of man &s;o con|&s;tituted, as to approve of certain actions, and to di&s;approve of others; to con&s;ider &s;ome actions as <HI>fit, right</HI> and <HI>meet</HI> to be done, and to con&s;ider others as <HI>unfit, unmeet</HI> and <HI>wrong.</HI> What di&s;tingui&s;hes actions, to make them objects of the one or other feel|ing, will be explained in the following cha|pter. And perhaps it will further appear, with regard to &s;ome of our actions, that the approbation, or di&s;approbation be&s;tow|ed, has a more peculiar modification than has been hitherto ob&s;erved, to be a founda|tion
<PB N="53" REF="59">
for the well known terms of <HI>duty</HI> and <HI>obligation,</HI> and con&s;equently for a rule of conduct, which, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, may be termed a law. But, at pre&s;ent, it is &s;uffici|ent to have explained in general, that we are &s;o con&s;tituted as to perceive or feel a Beau|ty and Deformity, and a Right and Wrong in actions. And this is what &s;trongly cha|racteri&s;es the laws which govern the actions of mankind. With regard to all other beings, we have no <HI>Data</HI> to di&s;cover the laws of their nature, other than their frame and con&s;titu|tion. We have the &s;ame <HI>Data</HI> to di&s;cover the laws of our own nature.

And one thing is extremely remark|able, which will be explained afterwards, that the laws which are fitted to the nature of man, and to his external circum&s;tances, are the &s;ame which we approve of by the moral &s;en&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Of</HI> DUTY <HI>and</HI> OBLIGATION.</HEAD>
<P>THO' the&s;e terms are of the utmo&s;t im|portance in morals, I know not that any author has attempted to explain them, by pointing out tho&s;e principles or feelings which they expre&s;s. This defect I &s;hall en|deavour to &s;upply, by tracing the&s;e terms to their proper &s;ource, without which the &s;y&s;|tem of morals cannot be complete, becau&s;e they point out to us the mo&s;t preci&s;e and e&s;|&s;ential branch of morality.</P>
<P>LORD <HI>Shaftesbury,</HI> to whom the world is much indebted for his ine&s;timable writ|ings, has clearly and convincingly made out, <Q>that virtue is the good, and vice the ill of every one.</Q> But he has not proved vir|tue to be our duty, otherways than by &s;how|ing it to be our intere&s;t, which does not come up to the idea of duty. For this term plain|ly implies &s;omewhat indi&s;pen&s;ible in our con|duct;
<PB N="55" REF="61">
what we ought to do, what we ought to &s;ubmit to. Now a man may be con&s;ider|ed as fooli&s;h, for acting again&s;t his intere&s;t, but he cannot be con&s;idered as wicked or vi|tious. His lord&s;hip, indeed, in his e&s;&s;ay up|on virtue <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 98.</NOTE>, points at an explanation of Du|ty and Obligation, by a&s;&s;erting the &s;ubordi|nacy of the &s;elf-affections to the &s;ocial. But tho' he &s;tates this as a propo&s;ition to be made out, he drops it in the after part of his work, and never again brings it into view.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hutchi&s;on,</HI> in his e&s;&s;ay upon beauty and virtue <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 101.</NOTE>, founds the morality of acti|ons on a certain quality of actions, which procures approbation and love to the agent. But this account of morality is imperfect, becau&s;e it excludes ju&s;tice, and every thing which may be &s;trictly called Duty. The man who, confining him&s;elf to &s;trict duty, is true to his word, and avoids harming o|thers, is a ju&s;t and moral man; is intitled to
<PB N="56" REF="62">
&s;ome &s;hare of e&s;teem, but will never be the object of love or friend&s;hip. He mu&s;t &s;how a di&s;po&s;ition to the good of mankind, at lea&s;t of his friends and neighbours: he mu&s;t exert acts of humanity and benevo|lence, before he can hope to procure the affection of others.</P>
<P>BUT it is principally to be ob&s;erved, that, in this account of morality, the terms <HI>right, obligation, duty, ought</HI> and <HI>&s;hould,</HI> have no di&s;tinct meaning; which &s;hows that the entire foundation of morality is not taken in by this author. It is true, that, towards the clo&s;e of his work, he endeavours to ex|plain the meaning of the term <HI>obligation.</HI> But as critici&s;ing upon authors, tho&s;e e&s;peci|ally who have laid them&s;elves out to ad|vance the cau&s;e of virtue, is not the mo&s;t agreeable task; I would not chu&s;e to &s;pend time, in &s;howing that he is un&s;ucce&s;sful in his attempt. The &s;lighte&s;t attention to the &s;ubject will make it evident. For his whole account of Obligation is no more than, <Q>ei|ther
<PB N="57" REF="63">
a motive from &s;elf-intere&s;t, &s;ufficient to determine all tho&s;e who duly con&s;ider it to a certain cour&s;e of action,</Q> which &s;urely is not moral obligation; <Q>a determination, without regard to our own intere&s;t, to approve actions, and to perform them; which determination &s;hall al&s;o make us di&s;plea&s;ed with our&s;elves, and unea&s;y upon having acted contrary to it;</Q> in which &s;en&s;e, he &s;ays, there is naturally an obligati|on upon all men to benevolence. But this account falls far &s;hort of the whole idea of obligation, and leaves no di&s;tinction betwixt it and a &s;imple approbation or di&s;approbati|on of the moral &s;en&s;e; feelings that attend many actions, which by no means come under the notion of <HI>obligation</HI> or <HI>duty.</HI></P>
<P>NEITHER is the author of the treati&s;e upon human nature more &s;ucce&s;sful, when he endeavours to re&s;olve the moral &s;en&s;e in|to pure &s;ympathy <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. 3. Part 3.</NOTE>. According to this author, there is no more in morality but ap|proving
<PB N="58" REF="64">
or di&s;approving of an action, after we di&s;cover by reflection that it tends to the good or hurt of &s;ociety. This would be by far too faint a principle to controul our irregular appetites and pa&s;&s;ions. It would &s;carce be &s;ufficient to re&s;train us from en|croaching upon our friends and neighbours; and, with regard to &s;trangers, would be the weake&s;t of all re&s;traints. We &s;hall, by and by, &s;how that morality has a more &s;olid foun|dation. In the mean time, it is of impor|tance to ob&s;erve, that upon this author's &s;y&s;tem, as well as <HI>Hutchi&s;on</HI>'s, the noted terms of <HI>duty, obligation, ought</HI> and <HI>&s;hould &amp;c.</HI> are perfectly unintelligible.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall now proceed to explain the&s;e terms, by pointing out the preci&s;e feelings which they expre&s;s. And, in performing this task, there will be di&s;covered a wonderful and beautiful contrivance of the Author of our nature, to give authority to morality, by putting the &s;elf-affections in a due &s;ubordina|tion to the &s;ocial. The moral &s;en&s;e has, in
<PB N="59" REF="65">
part, been explained above; that, by it, we perceive &s;ome actions under the modifi|cation of being <HI>fit, right,</HI> and <HI>meet</HI> to be done, and others under the modification of being <HI>unfit, unmeet</HI> and <HI>wrong.</HI> When this ob&s;ervation is applied to particulars, it is an evident fact, that we have a &s;en&s;e of <HI>fit|ne&s;s</HI> in kindly and beneficent actions. We approve of our&s;elves and others for perform|ing actions of this kind. As, on the other hand, we di&s;approve of the un&s;ociable, peev|i&s;h and hard-hearted. But, with regard to one &s;et of actions, there is a further modifi|cation of the moral &s;en&s;e. Actions directed again&s;t others, by which they are hurt or prejudged in their per&s;ons, in their fame, or in their goods, are the objects of a peculiar feeling. They are perceived and felt not only as <HI>unfit</HI> to be done, but as ab&s;olutely <HI>wrong</HI> to be done, and what, at any rate, we <HI>ought</HI> not to do. What is here a&s;&s;erted, is a matter of fact, which can admit of no o|ther proof than an appeal to every man's own feelings. Lay prejudice a&s;ide, and give fair play to the emotions of the heart. I ask
<PB N="60" REF="66">
no other conce&s;&s;ion. There is no man, how|ever irregular in his life and manners, how|ever poi&s;oned by a wrong education, but mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of this fact. And indeed the words which are to be found in all lan|guages, and which are perfectly under&s;tood in the communication of &s;entiments, are an evident demon&s;tration of it. <HI>Duty, obli|gation, ought</HI> and <HI>&s;hould,</HI> in their common meaning, would be empty &s;ounds, unle&s;s upon &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch a feeling.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e is the &s;ame with regard to grati|tude to benefactors, and performing of en|gagements. We feel the&s;e as our <HI>duty</HI> in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, and as what we are indi&s;|pen&s;ibly <HI>obliged</HI> to. We don't con&s;ider them as in any mea&s;ure under our own power. We have the feeling of nece&s;&s;ity, and of be|ing bound and tied to performance, almo&s;t equally as if we were under &s;ome external compul&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT is fit here to be remarked, that bene|volent and generous actions are not the ob|ject
<PB N="61" REF="67">
of this peculiar feeling. Hence, &s;uch actions, tho' con&s;idered as <HI>fit</HI> and <HI>right</HI> to be done, are not however con&s;idered to be our <HI>duty,</HI> but as virtuous actions beyond what is &s;trictly our duty. Benevolence and gene|ro&s;ity are more beautiful, and more attrac|tive of love and e&s;teem, than ju&s;tice. Yet, not being &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of &s;o|ciety, they are left upon the general footing of approbatory plea&s;ure; while ju&s;tice, faith, truth, without which &s;ociety could not at all &s;ub&s;i&s;t, are the objects of the above pecu|liar feeling, to take away all &s;hadow of li|berty, and to put us under a nece&s;&s;ity of per|formance.</P>
<P>DOCTOR <HI>Butler,</HI> a manly and acute writer, has gone further than any other, to a&s;&s;ign a ju&s;t foundation for moral Duty. He con&s;iders <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to the latter editions of his &s;ermons.</NOTE> con&s;cience or reflection, <Q>as one principle of action, which, compared with the re&s;t as they &s;tand together in the na|ture of man, plainly bears upon it marks
<PB N="62" REF="68">
of authority over all the re&s;t, and claims the ab&s;olute direction of them all, to al|low or forbid their gratification.</Q> And his proof of this propo&s;ition is, <Q>that a di&s;|approbation of reflection is in it&s;elf a prin|ciple manife&s;tly &s;uperior to a mere pro|pen&s;ion.</Q> Had this admirable author handled the &s;ubject more profe&s;&s;edly than he had occa&s;ion to do in a preface, 'tis more than likely he would have brought it out in|to its cleare&s;t light. But he has not &s;aid enough to afford that light which the &s;ub|ject is capable of. For it may be ob&s;erv|ed, in the fir&s;t place, that a di&s;approbation of reflection is far from being the whole of the matter. Such di&s;approbation is ap|plied to moro&s;ene&s;s, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and many other partial affections, which are, however, not con&s;idered in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e as contrary to our duty. And it may be doubted, whe|ther a di&s;approbation of reflection is, in eve|ry ca&s;e, a principle &s;uperior to a mere pro|pen&s;ion. We di&s;approve of a man who ne|glects his private affairs, and gives him&s;elf
<PB N="63" REF="69">
up to love, hunting, or any other amu&s;e|ment: nay, he di&s;approves of him&s;elf. Yet from this we cannot fairly conclude, that he is guilty of any breach of duty, or that it is unlawful for him to follow his propen&s;ion. We may ob&s;erve, in the next place, what will be afterwards explained, that con&s;cience, or the moral &s;en&s;e is none of our principles of action, but their guide and director. It is &s;till of greater importance to ob&s;erve, that the authority of con&s;cience does not merely con|&s;i&s;t in an act of reflection. It proceeds from a direct feeling, which we have upon pre&s;ent|ing the object, without the intervention of any &s;ort of reflection. And the authority lyes in this circum&s;tance, that we feel and perceive the action to be our duty, and what we are indi&s;pen&s;ibly bound to perform. It is in this manner, that the moral &s;en&s;e, with regard to &s;ome actions, plainly bears upon it the marks of authority over all our appetites and affections. It is the voice of God with|in us which commands our &s;tricte&s;t obedi|ence,
<PB N="64" REF="70">
ju&s;t as much as when his will is de|clared by expre&s;s revelation.</P>
<P>WHAT is above laid down is an analy&s;is of the moral &s;en&s;e, but not the whole of it. A very important branch &s;till remains to be unfolded. And, indeed, the more we &s;earch into the works of nature, the more oppor|tunity there is to admire the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the Sovereign Architect. In the matters above mentioned, performing of pro|mi&s;es, gratitude, and ab&s;taining from harm|ing others, we have not only the peculiar feeling and &s;en&s;e of duty and obligation: in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the&s;e duties we have not only the feeling of vice and wickedne&s;s, but we have further the &s;en&s;e of merited puni&s;hment, and dread of its being inflicted upon us. This dread may be but &s;light in the more venial tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. But, in crimes of a deep dye, it ri&s;es to a degree of angui&s;h and de&s;pair. Hence that remor&s;e of con&s;cience, which hi&s;tories are full of, upon the com|mi&s;&s;ion of certain crimes, and which proves
<PB N="65" REF="71">
the mo&s;t &s;evere of all tortures. This dread of merited puni&s;hment operates for the mo&s;t part &s;o &s;trongly upon the imagination, that every unu&s;ual accident, every extraordinary misfortune is con&s;idered as a puni&s;hment purpo&s;ely inflicted for the crime commit|ted. While the guilty per&s;on is in pro&s;pe|rity, he makes a &s;hift to blunt the &s;tings of his con&s;cience. But no &s;ooner does he fall into di&s;tre&s;s, or into any depre&s;&s;ion of mind, than his con&s;cience lays fa&s;t hold of him; his crime &s;tares him in the face; and every accidental misfortune is converted in|to a real puni&s;hment. <Q>And they &s;aid one to another, we are verily guilty concern|ing our brother, in that we &s;aw the angui&s;h of his &s;oul when he be&s;ought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this di&s;tre&s;s come upon us.

<P><PB N="66" REF="72">
ONE material circum&s;tance is here to be remarked, which makes a further difference betwixt the primary and &s;econdary virtues. As ju&s;tice, and the other primary virtues, are more e&s;&s;ential to &s;ociety than genero&s;ity, be|nevolence, or any other &s;econdary virtue, they are likeways more univer&s;al. Friend&s;hip, ge|nero&s;ity, &s;oftne&s;s of manners, form particular characters, and &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h one man from another. But the &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, and of the other primary virtues, is univer&s;al. It belongs to man as &s;uch. Tho' it exi&s;ts in very different degrees of &s;trength, there per|haps never was a human creature ab&s;olutely void of it. And it makes a delightful ap|pearance in the human con&s;titution, that e|ven where this &s;en&s;e is weak, as it is in &s;ome individuals, it notwith&s;tanding retains its au|thority as the director of their conduct. If there is any &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, or of ab&s;taining from injury, it mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h Right from Wrong, what we <HI>ought</HI> to do from what we <HI>ought not</HI> to do; and, by that very di&s;|tingui&s;hing feeling, ju&s;tly claims to be our

guide and governor. This con&s;ideration may &s;erve to ju&s;tify human laws, which make no di&s;tinction among men, as endued with a &s;tronger or weaker &s;en&s;e of morality.</P>
<P>AND here we mu&s;t pau&s;e a moment, to indulge &s;ome degree of admiration upon this part of the human &s;y&s;tem. Man is evident|ly intended to live in &s;ociety; and becau&s;e there can be no &s;ociety among creatures who prey upon one another, it was nece&s;&s;ary, in the fir&s;t place, to provide again&s;t mutual in|juries. Further; man is the weake&s;t of all creatures &s;eparately, and the very &s;tronge&s;t in &s;ociety. Therefore mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance is the principal end of &s;ociety. And to this end it was nece&s;&s;ary, that there &s;hould be mutu|al tru&s;t and reliance upon engagements, and that favours received &s;hould be thankfully repaid. Now nothing can be more finely adju&s;ted than the human heart to an&s;wer the&s;e purpo&s;es. 'Tis not &s;ufficient, that we approve of every action which is e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of &s;ociety. 'Tis not &s;uffici|ent,
<PB N="68" REF="74">
that we di&s;approve of every action which tends to its di&s;&s;olution. A &s;imple &s;en&s;e of approbation or di&s;approbation will &s;carce be &s;ufficient to give the&s;e actions the &s;anction of a law. But the approbation in this ca&s;e has the peculiar feeling of duty, that the&s;e actions are what we ought to perform, and what we are indi&s;pen&s;ibly bound to perform. This circum&s;tance converts into a law what without it can only be con&s;idered as a rati|onal mea&s;ure, and a prudential rule of acti|on. Nor is any thing omitted to give it the mo&s;t complete character of a law. The tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is attended with apprehen&s;ion of puni&s;hment, nay with actual puni&s;hment; as every misfortune which befalls the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or is con&s;idered by him as a puni&s;h|ment. Nor is this the whole of the mat|ter. Sympathy with our fellow-creatures is a principle implanted in the brea&s;t of every man: we cannot hurt another without &s;uf|fering for it, which is an additional puni&s;h|ment. And we are &s;till further puni&s;hed for our inju&s;tice, or ingratitude, by incurring thereby the aver&s;ion and hatred of mankind.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Of the</HI> DIFFERENT ORDERS <HI>of</HI> MORAL BEAUTY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a fact which will be univer&s;ally ad|mitted, that no man thinks &s;o highly of him&s;elf, or of another, for having done a ju&s;t, as for having done a generous action: yet every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that ju&s;tice is more e&s;&s;ential than genero&s;ity to the order and pre&s;ervation of &s;ociety; and why we &s;hould place the greater merit upon the le&s;s e&s;&s;ential action may appear unaccountable. This mat|ter de&s;erves to be examined, becau&s;e it gives a further opening to the &s;cience of morals.</P>
<P>UPON a &s;mall degree of reflection, it will appear, that the whole &s;y&s;tem of morals is founded upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of liberty of action <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor Butler, preface to his &s;ermons, page 11. &s;ays, <Q>Our con&s;titution is put into our own power: we are charged with it; and therefore are accountable for any di&s;order or violation of it.</Q></NOTE>. If actions were under&s;tood to be
<PB N="70" REF="76">
nece&s;&s;ary, and no way under our power or controul, we could never conceive them as fit or unfit to be done; as what we are indi&s;|pen&s;ibly bound to do or not to do. To have &s;uch a feeling of human actions, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of nece&s;&s;ity, would be as incon|&s;i&s;tent as to have &s;uch a feeling of the acti|ons of matter. The celebrated di&s;pute about liberty and nece&s;&s;ity is re&s;erved to be di&s;cu&s;s|ed in a following e&s;&s;ay. But without enter|ing upon that &s;ubject at pre&s;ent, one fact is certain, that in acting we have a feeling of liberty and independency. We never do a wrong, however &s;trong the motive be, which is not attended with a &s;evere reflecti|on, that we <HI>might</HI> have done otherways, and <HI>ought</HI> to have done otherways. Nay, du|ring the very action, in the very time of it, we have a &s;en&s;e or feeling of wrong, and that we <HI>ought</HI> to forbear. So that the moral &s;en&s;e, both in the direct feeling, and in the act of reflection, plainly &s;uppo&s;es and im|plies liberty of action.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="77">
THIS, if we mi&s;take not, will clear the difficulty above &s;tated. If in the moral &s;en&s;e be involved liberty of action, there mu&s;t of con&s;equence be the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e or feeling of morality where liberty is greate&s;t. Now, in judging of human actions, tho&s;e actions, which are e&s;&s;ential to the order and pre&s;er|vation of &s;ociety, are con&s;idered to be in a good mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary. It is our &s;trict duty to be ju&s;t and hone&s;t. We are bound by a law in our nature, which we ought not to tran&s;gre&s;s. No &s;uch feeling of duty or obligation attends tho&s;e actions which come under the denomination of <HI>genero&s;ity, great|ne&s;s of mind, heroi&s;m.</HI> Ju&s;tice, therefore, is con&s;idered as le&s;s free than genero&s;ity; and, upon that very account, we a&s;cribe le&s;s me|rit to the former, than to the latter. We a|&s;cribe no merit at all to an action which is altogether involuntary; and we a&s;cribe more or le&s;s merit, in proportion as the action is more or le&s;s voluntary.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="78">
THUS there is di&s;covered two ranks or cla&s;&s;es of moral actions, which are different in their nature, and different as to the laws by which they are enforced. Tho&s;e of the fir&s;t rank, being e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of &s;ociety, are entirely withdrawn from our e|lection and choice. They are perceived as indi&s;pen&s;ibly obligatory upon us; and the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the laws, which regulate this branch of our conduct, is attended with &s;e|vere and never-failing puni&s;hment. In a word, there is not a characteri&s;tic of po&s;i|tive law which is not applicable, in the &s;trict|e&s;t &s;en&s;e, to the&s;e laws of nature; with this material difference, that the &s;anctions of the&s;e laws are greatly more efficacious than any have been that invented to enforce munici|pal laws. Tho&s;e of the &s;econd rank, which contribute to the improvement of &s;ociety, but are not &s;trictly nece&s;&s;ary to its &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, are left to our own choice. They have not the character of moral nece&s;&s;ity im|pre&s;&s;ed upon them, nor is the forbearance of them attended with the feeling of guilt. On
<PB N="73" REF="79">
the other hand, the actions which belong to this rank are the objects of the &s;tronge&s;t feelings of moral beauty; of the highe&s;t de|gree of approbation, both from our&s;elves and others. Offices of unde&s;erved kindne&s;s, re|quital of good for evil, generous toils and &s;ufferings for the good of our country, come under this cla&s;s. The&s;e are not made our <HI>duty.</HI> There is no motive to the perform|ance, which, in any proper &s;en&s;e, can be called a law. But there are the &s;tronge&s;t motives that can con&s;i&s;t with perfect free|dom. The performance is rewarded with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;elf-merit, and with the prai&s;e and admiration of all the world, which are the highe&s;t and mo&s;t refined plea&s;ures that human nature is &s;u&s;ceptible of.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;o much of enthu&s;ia&s;m in this branch of moral beauty, that it is not wonderful to find per&s;ons of a free and generous turn of mind captivated with it, who are le&s;s attentive to the virtues of the
<PB N="74" REF="80">
fir&s;t cla&s;s. The magnanimous, who can|not bear re&s;traint, are more guided by gene|ro&s;ity than ju&s;tice. Yet, as pain is a &s;trong|er motive to action than plea&s;ure, the remor&s;e which attends a breach of &s;trict duty is, with the bulk of mankind, a more powerful in|citement to hone&s;ty, than prai&s;e and &s;elf-ap|probation are to genero&s;ity. And there can|not be a more pregnant in&s;tance of wi&s;dom than this part of the human con&s;titution; it being far more e&s;&s;ential to &s;ociety, that all men be ju&s;t and hone&s;t, than that they be patriots and heroes.</P>
<P>THE &s;um of what is above laid down is, that, with regard to actions of the fir&s;t rank, the pain of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the law is much greater than the plea&s;ure which re&s;ults from obeying it. The contrary is the ca&s;e of actions of the &s;econd rank. The plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the performance is much great|er than the pain of neglect.

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Of the</HI> PRINCIPLES <HI>of</HI> ACTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the three foregoing chapters we have taken &s;ome pains to inquire into the moral &s;en&s;e, and to annali&s;e it into its diffe|rent feelings. Our pre&s;ent task mu&s;t be to inquire into tho&s;e principles in our nature which move us to action. The&s;e are diffe|rent &s;ubjects. For the moral &s;en&s;e, proper|ly &s;peaking, is not a principle which moves us to action. Its province is to in&s;truct us, which of our principles of action we may indulge, and which of them we mu&s;t re|&s;train. It is the voice of God within us, informing us of our duty.</P>
<P>IN a treati&s;e upon the law of nature it is of great importance to trace out the prin|ciples by which we are led to action. We have above ob&s;erved, that the laws of nature can be no other than rules of action adapted to our nature. Now our nature, &s;o far as
<PB N="77" REF="83">
concerns action, is made up of appetites, pa&s;&s;ions and affections, which are the prin|ciples of action, and of the moral &s;en&s;e, by which the&s;e principles are governed and di|rected. No action therefore is a duty, to the performance of which we are not prompted by &s;ome natural principle. To make &s;uch an action our duty, would be to lay down a rule of conduct contrary to our nature, or that has no foundation in our nature. Con|&s;cience, or the moral &s;en&s;e, may re&s;train us from actions to which we are incited by a natural principle: but con&s;cience, or the mo|ral &s;en&s;e, is not, in any ca&s;e, the &s;ole prin|ciple or motive of action. Nature has a&s;|&s;igned it a different province. This is a truth which has been little attended to by tho&s;e who have given us &s;y&s;tems of natural laws. No wonder, therefore, they have wandered &s;o far from truth. Let it be kept clo&s;e in view, and it will put an end to many a con|trover&s;y about the&s;e laws. For example, if it be laid down as a primary law of nature, that we are &s;trictly bound to advance the
<PB N="78" REF="84">
good of all, regarding our own intere&s;t no further than as it makes a part of the gene|ral happine&s;s, we may &s;afely reject &s;uch a law as incon&s;i&s;tent with our nature, unle&s;s it be made appear, that there is a principle of benevolence in man which prompts him to an equal pur&s;uit of the happine&s;s of all. To found this di&s;intere&s;ted &s;cheme wholly upon the moral &s;en&s;e, would be a fruitle&s;s endeavour. The moral &s;en&s;e, as above ob&s;erv|ed, is our guide only, not our mover. Ap|probation or di&s;approbation of the&s;e actions, to which, by &s;ome natural principle, we are antecedently directed, is all that can re&s;ult from it. If it be laid down, on the other hand, that we ought only to regard our&s;elves in all our actions, and that it is folly, if not vice, to concern our&s;elves for others, &s;uch a law can never be admitted, unle&s;s upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;elf-love is our only prin|ciple of action.</P>
<P>IT is probable, that, in the following parti|cular, man differs from the brute creation.
<PB N="79" REF="85">
Brutes are entirely governed by principles of action, which, in them, obtain the name of In&s;tincts. They blindly follow their in|&s;tincts, and are led by that in&s;tinct which is &s;tronge&s;t for the time. It is <HI>meet</HI> and <HI>fit</HI> they &s;hould act after this manner, becau&s;e it is acting according to the whole of their nature. But for man to allow him&s;elf to be led implicitly by in&s;tinct, or his principles of action, without check or controul, is not acting according to the whole of his nature. He is endued with a moral &s;en&s;e or con&s;ci|ence, to check and controul his principles of action, and to in&s;truct him which of them he may indulge, and which of them he ought to re&s;train. This account of the brute creation is undoubtedly true in the main: whether &s;o in every particular is of no importance to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, being on|ly &s;ugge&s;ted by way of contra&s;t, to illu&s;trate the peculiar nature of man.</P>
<P>AFULL account of our principles of action would be an endle&s;s theme. But as it is pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="80" REF="86">
to confine the pre&s;ent &s;hort e&s;&s;ay to the laws which govern &s;ocial life, we &s;hall have no occa&s;ion to inquire into any prin|ciples of action, but what are directed upon others; dropping the&s;e which have &s;elf a|lone for their object. And, in this inquiry, we &s;et out with a mo&s;t important que&s;tion, <HI>&s;eiz.</HI> In what &s;en&s;e we are to hold a princi|ple of univer&s;al benevolence, as belonging to human nature? When we con&s;ider a &s;ingle man, ab&s;tracted from all circum&s;tances and all connections, we are not con&s;cious of any benevolence to him: we feel nothing with|in us that prompts us to advance his happi|ne&s;s. If one is agreeable at fir&s;t &s;ight, and attracts any degree of affection, it is owing to looks, manner or behaviour. And for e|vidence of this, we are as apt to be di&s;gu&s;ted at fir&s;t &s;ight, as to be plea&s;ed. Man is by nature a &s;hy and timorous animal. Every new object gives an impre&s;&s;ion of fear, till, upon better acquaintance, it is di&s;covered to be harmle&s;s. Thus an infant clings to its nur&s;e upon the &s;ight of a new face; and
<PB N="81" REF="87">
this natural dread is not removed but by long experience. If every human creature did produce affection in every other at fir&s;t &s;ight, children, by natural in&s;tinct, would be fond of &s;trangers. But no &s;uch in&s;tinct di&s;covers it&s;elf. Fondne&s;s is confined to the nur&s;e, the parents, and tho&s;e who are mo&s;t about the child; 'till, by degrees, it o|pens to a &s;en&s;e of larger connections. This argument may be illu&s;trated by a very low, but very apt in&s;tance. Dogs have, by nature, an affection for the human &s;pecies; and, upon this account, puppies run to the fir&s;t man they &s;ee, &s;how marks of fond|ne&s;s, and play about his feet. There is no &s;uch general fondne&s;s of man to man by nature. Particular circum&s;tances are al|ways required to produce and call it forth. Di&s;tre&s;s indeed never fails to beget &s;ym|pathy. The mi&s;ery of the mo&s;t unknown is a painful object, and we are prompted by nature to afford relief. But when there is nothing to call forth our &s;ympathy; where there are no peculiar circum&s;tances to inte|re&s;t
<PB N="82" REF="88">
us, or beget a connection, we re&s;t in a &s;tate of indifference, and are not con&s;cious of wi&s;hing either good or ill to the per&s;on. Tho&s;e morali&s;ts, therefore, who require us to lay a&s;ide all partial affection, and to act upon a principle of general equal benevo|lence to all men, require us to act upon a principle which in truth has no place in our nature.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING of this it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, that man is endued with a prin|ciple of univer&s;al benevolence. For the hap|pine&s;s of mankind is an object agreeable to the mind in contemplation; and good men have a &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure in every &s;tudy or pur&s;uit by which they can promote it. It mu&s;t in|deed be acknowledged, that benevolence is not equally directed to all men, but gradual|ly decrea&s;es, according to the di&s;tance of the object, 'till it dwindle away to nothing. But here comes in a happy contrivance of nature, to &s;upply the want of benevolence to|wards di&s;tant objects; which is, to give pow|er
<PB N="83" REF="89">
to an ab&s;tract term, &s;uch as our religion, our country, our government, or even man|kind, to rai&s;e benevolence or publick &s;pirit in the mind. The particular objects under each of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es, con&s;idered &s;ingly and apart, may have little or no force to pro|duce affection; but when comprehended un|der one general term, they become an ob|ject that dilates and warms the heart: and, in this way, man is enabled to embrace in his affection all mankind, and thereby prom|pted to publick &s;pirited actions.</P>
<P>HE mu&s;t have a great &s;hare of indifference in his temper who can reflect upon this branch of human nature without &s;ome de|gree of emotion. There is perhaps not one &s;cene to be met with in the natural or mo|ral world, where more of de&s;ign and of con|&s;ummate wi&s;dom are di&s;played, than in this under con&s;ideration. The authors, who, im|pre&s;&s;ed with reverence for human nature, have endeavoured to exalt it to the highe&s;t pitch, could none of them &s;tretch their ima|gination beyond a principle of equal and u|niver&s;al
<PB N="84" REF="90">
benevolence. And a very fine &s;cheme it is in idea. But unluckily it is entirely of the <HI>Utopian</HI> kind, altogether unfit for life and action. It has e&s;caped the con&s;iderati|on of the&s;e authors, that man is by nature of a limited capacity, and that his affection, by multiplication of objects, in&s;tead of be|ing increa&s;ed, is &s;plit into parts, and weaken|ed by divi&s;ion. A principle of univer&s;al e|qual benevolence, by dividing the attention and affection, in&s;tead of promoting benevo|lent actions, would in reality be an ob&s;truc|tion to them. The mind would be di&s;tract|ed by the multiplicity of objects that have an equal influence, &s;o as to be eternally at a lo&s;s where to &s;et out. But the human &s;y&s;tem is better adju&s;ted, than to admit of &s;uch di&s;|proportion betwixt ability and affection. The principal objects of man's love are his friends and relations. He has to &s;pare for his neighbours. His affection le&s;&s;ens gradually in proportion to the di&s;tance of the object, 'till it vani&s;h altogether. But were this the whole of human nature, with regard to be|nevolence,
<PB N="85" REF="91">
man would be but an abject crea|ture. By a very happy contrivance, objects which, becau&s;e of their di&s;tance, have little or no influence, are made by accumulation, and by being gathered together, in one ge|neral view, to have the very &s;tronge&s;t effect; exceeding in many in&s;tances the mo&s;t lively affection that is be&s;towed upon particular objects. By this happy contrivance the at|tention of the mind, and its affections, are pre&s;erved entire, to be be&s;towed upon gene|ral objects, in&s;tead of being di&s;&s;ipated by an endle&s;s divi&s;ion. Nothing more ennobles human nature than this principle or &s;pring of action; and, at the &s;ame time, nothing is more wonderful, than that a general term, to which a very faint, if any, idea is affixt, &s;hould be the foundation of a more inten&s;e affection than is be&s;towed, for the mo&s;t part, upon particular objects, how attractive &s;oever. When we talk of our country, our religion, our government, the ideas annexed to the&s;e general terms are at be&s;t ob&s;cure and indi|&s;tinct. General terms are extremely u&s;eful
<PB N="86" REF="92">
in language, &s;erving, like mathematical &s;igns, to communicate our thoughts in a &s;ummary way. But the u&s;e of them is not confined to language. They &s;erve for a much nobler purpo&s;e, to excite us to generous and bene|volent actions, of the mo&s;t exalted kind; not confined to particulars, but gra&s;ping whole &s;ocieties, towns, countries, kingdoms, nay, all mankind. By this curious mecha|ni&s;m, the defect of our nature is amply re|medied. Di&s;tant objects, otherways in&s;en|&s;ible, are rendered con&s;picuous. Accumula|tion makes them great, and greatne&s;s brings them near the eye. The affection is pre&s;erv|ed, to be be&s;towed entire, as upon a &s;ingle object. And to &s;ay all in one word, this &s;y|&s;tem of benevolence, which is really found|ed in human nature, and not the invention of man, is infinitely better contrived to advance the good and happine&s;s of man|kind, than any <HI>Utopian</HI> &s;y&s;tem that ever has been produced, by the warme&s;t imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="93">
UPON the oppo&s;ite &s;y&s;tem of ab&s;olute &s;el|fi&s;hne&s;s, there is no occa&s;ion to lo&s;e a mo|ment. It is evidently chimerical, becau&s;e it has no foundation in human nature. It is not more certain, that there exi&s;ts the crea|ture man, than that he has principles of ac|tion directed entirely upon others; &s;ome to do them good, and others to do them mi&s;|chief. Who can doubt of this, when friend|&s;hip, compa&s;&s;ion, gratitude on the one hand; and, on the other, malice and re&s;entment are con&s;idered. It has indeed been ob&s;erved, that we indulge &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions and affections merely for our own gratification. But no per|&s;on can reli&s;h this ob&s;ervation, who is in any mea&s;ure acquainted with human nature. The &s;ocial affections are in fact the &s;ource of the deepe&s;t afflictions, as well as of the mo&s;t ex|alted plea&s;ures, as has been fully laid open in the foregoing e&s;&s;ay. In a word, we are evidently formed by nature for &s;ociety, and for indulging the &s;ocial, as well as the &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions; and therefore, to contend, that we ought only to regard our&s;elves, and to be
<PB N="88" REF="94">
influenced by no principles but what are &s;el|fi&s;h, is directly to fly in the face of nature, and to lay down a rule of conduct incon|&s;i&s;tent with our nature.</P>
<P>THESE &s;y&s;tems being laid a&s;ide, as widely erring from the nature of man, the way lyes open to come at what are his true and genu|ine principles of action. The fir&s;t thing that nature con&s;ults, is the pre&s;ervation of her creatures. Hence the love of life is made the &s;tronge&s;t of all in&s;tincts. Upon the &s;ame foun|dation, pain is in a greater degree the object of aver&s;ion, than plea&s;ure is of de&s;ire. Pain warns us of what tends to our di&s;&s;olution, and &s;o is a &s;trong guard to &s;elf-pre&s;ervation: Plea&s;ure is often &s;ought after unwarily, and by means dangerous to health and life. Pain comes in as a monitor of our danger; and nature, con&s;ulting our pre&s;ervation in the fir&s;t place, and our gratification only in the &s;e|cond, wi&s;ely gives pain more force to draw us back, than it gives plea&s;ure to pu&s;h us forward.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="95">
THE &s;econd principle of action is &s;elf-love, or de&s;ire of our own happine&s;s and good. This is a &s;tronger principle than bene|volence, or love be&s;towed upon others; and in that re&s;pect is wi&s;ely ordered, becau&s;e every man has more power, knowledge, and opportunity to promote his own good, than that of others. Thus the good of in|dividuals is principally tru&s;ted to their own care. It is agreeable to the limited nature of &s;uch a creature as man, that it &s;hould be &s;o, and con&s;equently it is wi&s;ely ordered that every man &s;hould have the &s;tronge&s;t affecti|on for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE above principles have <HI>Self</HI> for their object. The following regard others. Fi|delity is undoubtedly a principle of action not of the weake&s;t &s;ort. Performance of pro|mi&s;es, the &s;tanding true to engagements, and in general the executing of tru&s;ts, come under this head.

GRATITUDE is a fourth principle of ac|tion, univer&s;ally acknowledged; and Benevo|lence po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the la&s;t place, diver&s;ified by its objects, and exerting it&s;elf more vigorou&s;ly, or more faintly, in proportion to the di&s;tance of particular objects, and the grandeur of tho&s;e that are general. This principle of ac|tion has one remarkable modification, that it operates with much greater force to relieve tho&s;e in di&s;tre&s;s, than to promote po&s;itive good.

<P>THESE &s;everal principles of action are or|dered, with admirable wi&s;dom, to promote the general good in the be&s;t and mo&s;t effec|tual manner. We act for the general good, when we act upon the&s;e principles, even when it is not our immediate aim. The general good is an object too &s;ublime, and too remote, to be the &s;ole impul&s;ive motive to action. It is better ordered, that, in mo&s;t in|&s;tances, individuals &s;hould have a limited aim,
<PB N="91" REF="97">
which they can readily accompli&s;h. To e|very man is a&s;&s;igned his own task. And, if every man do his duty, the general good will be promoted much more &s;ucce&s;sfully, than if it were the aim in every &s;ingle action.</P>
<P>THE above mentioned principles of acti|on belong to man as &s;uch, and con&s;titute what may be called the common nature of man. Many other principles exert them|&s;elves upon particular objects in the in&s;tinc|tive manner, without the intervention of a|ny &s;ort of rea&s;oning or reflection, which al|&s;o belong to man as &s;uch, appetite for food, lu&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Other particular appetites, pa&s;&s;i|ons and affections, &s;uch as ambition, avarice, envy, love of novelty, of grandeur, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> con&s;titute the peculiar nature of individuals; becau&s;e the&s;e are diver&s;ified among individu|als in very different degrees. It belongs to the &s;cience of Ethics, to treat of the&s;e parti|cular principles of action. All that needs here be ob&s;erved of them is, that it is the aim of the general principle of &s;elf-love to obtain gratification to the&s;e particular principles.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Of the</HI> SOURCE <HI>of the</HI> LAWS <HI>of</HI> NATURE, <HI>according to &s;ome Authors.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus at full length explain|ed the nature of man, &s;o far as concerns the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, it may not be di&s;agreeable to the reader, to have &s;ome re|laxation, before he enters upon the remain|ing part of the work. We &s;hall fill up this interval with a view of &s;ome opinions, about the foundation of the laws of nature, which we cannot help judging to be inaccurate, if not erroneous. The epi&s;ode is, at the &s;ame time, &s;trictly connected with the principal &s;ubject; becau&s;e truth is always be&s;t illu&s;trat|ed by oppo&s;ing it to error. That morality depends entirely on the will of God, and that his will creates the only obligation we ly under to be virtuous, is the opinion of &s;everal writers. This opinion, in one &s;en&s;e, is true; but far from being true in their &s;en&s;e who inculcate it. And, true or fal&s;e, it does
<PB N="93" REF="99">
not advance us a &s;ingle &s;tep in the know|ledge of our duty. For what does it avail to know, that morality depends upon the will of God, 'till we once know what his will is? If it be &s;aid, there is an original re|velation of it to us in our nature, this can only mean, that our nature it&s;elf makes us feel the di&s;tinction betwixt virtue and vice, which is the very doctrine above laid down. But, &s;ay they, God, from the purity and rectitude of his nature, cannot but approve of good actions, and di&s;approve of &s;uch as are other|ways. Here they don't con&s;ider, that this argument &s;uppo&s;es a di&s;tinction betwixt vir|tue and vice antecedent to the will of God. For if, ab&s;tracting from his will, virtue and vice were indifferent, which is &s;uppo&s;ed in the propo&s;ition, we have no <HI>Data</HI> from the purity of God's nature, or from any other principle, to conclude, that virtue is more the object of his choice than vice. But, fur|ther, the very &s;uppo&s;ition of the purity and rectitude of the nature of the Divine Being pre&s;uppo&s;es a ta&s;te, feeling, or knowledge in
<PB N="94" REF="100">
us of an e&s;&s;ential difference betwixt virtue and vice. Therefore it can never be &s;aid, in any proper &s;en&s;e, that our only obli|gation to virtue is the will of God, &s;eeing it is true, that, ab&s;tracting altogether from his will, there is an obligation to virtue found|ed in the very frame of our nature.</P>
<P>IN one &s;en&s;e, indeed, it is true, that mora|lity depends upon the will of God, who made us &s;uch as we are, with a moral &s;en&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h virtue from vice. But this is &s;aying no more but that it is God's will, or that it is agreeable to him we &s;hould be vir|tuous. It is another thing to maintain, that man is indifferent to virtue and vice, and that he is under no obligation to the one more than to the other, unle&s;s &s;o far as he is de|termined by the arbitrary will of a &s;uperi|or, or &s;overeign. That a being may be &s;o framed as to an&s;wer this de&s;cription, may be yielded. But, taking man as he is, endued with a moral &s;en&s;e, 'tis a direct contradicti|on to hold, that he is under no obligation to
<PB N="95" REF="101">
virtue, other than the mere will of God. In this &s;en&s;e, morality no more depends upon the will of God, than upon our own will.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall next take a view of a doctrine, which may be &s;et in oppo&s;ition to the fore|going, and that is Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI>'s demon&s;tra|tion of the unalterable obligation of moral duty. His propo&s;ition is, <Q>That, from the eternal and nece&s;&s;ary differences of things, there naturally and nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e cer|tain moral obligations, which are of them|&s;elves incumbent on all rational creatures, antecedent to all po&s;itive in&s;titution, and to all expectation of reward or puni&s;h|ment.</Q> And this propo&s;ition he demon|&s;trates in the following manner: <Q>That there is a fitne&s;s of certain circum&s;tances to certain per&s;ons, and an unfitne&s;s of o|thers, antecedent to po&s;itive laws; and that, from the different relations of different things, there ari&s;es a fitne&s;s and unfitne&s;s of certain behaviour of &s;ome per&s;ons. For in&s;tance, God is &s;uperior to man, and
<PB N="96" REF="102">
therefore it is fit that man &s;hould wor&s;hip him.</Q></P>
<P>IF this demon&s;tration, as it is called, be the only or principal foundation of morals, unlucky it is, that a doctrine of &s;uch impor|tance &s;hould have &s;o long been hid from the publick. The antients, however, carri|ed the obligation of morals perhaps as far as this eminent divine does. And now that the important di&s;covery is made, it is not likely to do great &s;ervice; con&s;idering how little the bulk of mankind are able to enter into ab&s;tru&s;e rea&s;oning, and how little influ|ence &s;uch rea&s;oning generally has after it is apprehended.</P>
<P>BUT ab&s;tru&s;ene&s;s is not the only imper|fection of this celebrated argument. It ap|pears to me altogether inconclu&s;ive. Laying a&s;ide perception and feeling, upon which the doctor founds no part of his demon&s;tration, I &s;hould be utterly at a lo&s;s, from any given relation betwixt per&s;ons, to draw a conclu|&s;ion
<PB N="97" REF="103">
of the fitne&s;s or unfitne&s;s of a certain cour&s;e of behaviour. <Q>God is our &s;u|perior, and therefore it is fit we &s;hould wor&s;hip him.</Q> But here I put the que|&s;tion, upon what principle of rea&s;on does this conclu&s;ion re&s;t? where is the connecting propo&s;ition by means of which the infe|rence is drawn? Here the doctor mu&s;t be utterly at a lo&s;s. For the truth of the mat|ter is, that the terms <HI>fitne&s;s</HI> and <HI>unfitne&s;s,</HI> in their pre&s;ent &s;ignification, depend entire|ly upon the moral &s;en&s;e. <HI>Fitne&s;s</HI> and <HI>unfit|ne&s;s,</HI> with regard to a certain end or purpo&s;e, are qualities of actions which may be gather|ed from experience. But <HI>fitne&s;s</HI> or <HI>unfit|ne&s;s</HI> of actions, as importing <HI>right</HI> or <HI>wrong,</HI> as denoting what we <HI>ought</HI> to do, or ab&s;tain from, have truly no meaning, unle&s;s upon &s;uppo&s;ition of a moral &s;en&s;e, which this learned divine never once dreams of taking into his argument. The doctor's error there|fore is a common one, that he endeavours to &s;ub&s;titute rea&s;on in place of feeling. The fitne&s;s of wor&s;hipping our Creator was obvi|ous
<PB N="98" REF="104">
to him, as it is to every man, becau&s;e it is founded in our very nature. It is equal|ly obvious with the preference of hone&s;ty to di&s;hone&s;ty. His only mi&s;take is, that, over|looking the <HI>law written in his own heart,</HI> he vainly imagines that his metaphy&s;ical ar|gument is ju&s;t, becau&s;e the con&s;equence he draws from it happens to be true. And to &s;a|tisfy even his mo&s;t devoted di&s;ciples, that this is the ca&s;e, let us only &s;uppo&s;e, that man, by nature, had no approbatory or di&s;appro|batory feeling of actions, it could never be evinced, by any ab&s;tract argument whatever, that the wor&s;hip of the Deity is his duty, or, in the moral &s;en&s;e of fitne&s;s, that it is more fit for him to be hone&s;t than to be di&s;hone&s;t.</P>
<P>AND, upon this head, we will take the liberty to add, becau&s;e it is of importance to the &s;ubject in general, that, &s;uppo&s;ing our duty could be made plain to us, by an ab|&s;tract chain of rea&s;oning, yet we have good ground to conclude, from analogy, that the Author of nature has not left our actions to
<PB N="99" REF="105">
be directed by &s;o weak a principle as rea&s;on: and a weak principle it mu&s;t be to the bulk of mankind, who have little capacity to en|ter into ab&s;tract rea&s;oning; whatever effect it may have upon the learned and contempla|tive. Nature has dealt more kindly by us. We are compelled by &s;trong and evident feelings, to perform all the different duties of life. Self-pre&s;ervation is not left to the conduct of rea&s;on, but is guarded by the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tinct, which makes us carefully, or rather mechanically, avoid every appear|ance of danger. The propagation of the &s;pecies is enforced by the mo&s;t importunate of all appetites, and the care of our off|&s;pring by a lively and con&s;tant affection. Is nature &s;o deficient, as to leave the duty we owe our neighbour, which &s;tands in the fir&s;t rank of duties, to be directed by cool rea&s;oning? This is not according to the ana|logy of nature, nor is it fact: witne&s;s com|pa&s;&s;ion, friend&s;hip, benevolence, and all the tribe of the &s;ocial affections. Neither is common ju&s;tice left upon this footing, the
<PB N="100" REF="106">
mo&s;t u&s;eful, tho' not the mo&s;t exalted virtue. The tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of it is attended with a &s;e|vere feeling of di&s;approbation, and al&s;o en|forced by other feelings &s;till more cogent and authoritative.</P>
<P>A LATE author <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Woola&s;ton.</NOTE>, whom I &s;hall ju&s;t mention by the way, gives a whim&s;ical &s;y&s;tem of morals. He endeavours to reduce all crimes to that of telling a lie; and, becau&s;e telling a lie is immoral, he concludes, that the &s;everal crimes he mentions are immoral. Robbery, for example, is acting or telling a lie; becau&s;e it is in effect &s;aying, that the goods I &s;ei&s;e are mine. Adultery is acting or telling a lie, becau&s;e it is in effect main|taining that my neighbour's wife is not his, but mine. But not to in&s;i&s;t upon the folly of giving all crimes the &s;ame character, and confounding their nature, it appears evident, that, in this argument, the very thing is taken for granted which is to be proved. For why is it a virtual lie to rob one of his goods? Is
<PB N="101" REF="107">
it not by impo&s;ing upon mankind, who mu&s;t pre&s;ume tho&s;e goods to be mine, which I take as my own? But does not this evident|ly pre&s;uppo&s;e a difference betwixt <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum,</HI> and that I ought not to make free with another's property without his con&s;ent? For what other rea&s;on are the goods pre&s;umed to be mine, but that it is unlawful to meddle with what belongs to another? The &s;ame ob&s;erva|tion will apply to all his other tran&s;mutations; for, in acting or telling the lie, it is con&s;tantly taken for granted, that the action is wrong in it&s;elf. And this very wrong is the circum|&s;tance which is &s;uppo&s;ed, in the rea&s;oning, to impo&s;e upon the &s;pectators. The error there|fore of this author is of the &s;ame nature with Dr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s, in his &s;y&s;tem above examined. It is an evident <HI>petitio principii:</HI> the very thing is taken for granted which is under|taken to be proved. With regard to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, we have no occa&s;ion fur|ther to ob&s;erve of this curious author, that when he draws &s;o &s;trong con&s;equences from telling a lie, it was to be expected he &s;hould
<PB N="102" REF="108">
have &s;et in the cleare&s;t light the immorality of that action. But this he does not &s;o much as attempt, leaving it upon the conviction of one's own mind. This indeed he might &s;afely do; but not more &s;afely than to leave upon the &s;ame conviction all the other crimes he treats of.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Of</HI> JUSTICE <HI>and</HI> INJUSTICE.</HEAD>
<P>JUSTICE is that moral virtue which guards property, and gives authority to covenants. And as it is made out above, that ju&s;tice, being e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the main|tenance of &s;ociety, is one of tho&s;e primary virtues which are enforced by the &s;tronge&s;t natural laws, it would be unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay more upon the &s;ubject, were it not for a doctrine e&s;pou&s;ed by the author of a treati&s;e upon human nature, that ju&s;tice, &s;o far from being one of the primary virtues, is not e|ven a natural virtue, but e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;oci|ety by a &s;ort of tacit convention, founded upon a notion of public intere&s;t. The figure which this author de&s;ervedly makes in the learned world, is too con&s;iderable, to admit of his being pa&s;t over in &s;ilence. And as it is of great importance to creatures who live in &s;o|ciety, to have ju&s;tice e&s;tabli&s;hed upon its mo&s;t &s;olid foundation, a chapter expre&s;sly upon
<PB N="104" REF="110">
this &s;ubject may perhaps not be unacceptable to the reader.</P>
<P>OUR author's doctrine, &s;o far as it con|cerns that branch of ju&s;tice by which proper|ty is &s;ecured, comes to this; that, in a &s;tate of nature, there can be no &s;uch thing as pro|perty; and that the idea of property ari&s;es, after ju&s;tice is e&s;tabli&s;hed by convention, whereby every one is &s;ecured in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons. In oppo&s;ition to this &s;ingular doctrine, there is no difficulty to make out, that we have an idea of property, antecedent to any &s;ort of agreement or convention; that proper|ty is founded on a natural principle; and that violation of property is attended with re|mor&s;e, and a &s;en&s;e of breach of duty. In following out this &s;ubject, it will appear how admirably the &s;prings of human nature are adapted one to another, and to external circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>MAN is by nature fitted for labour, and his enjoyment lyes in action. To this inter|nal
<PB N="105" REF="111">
con&s;titution his external circum&s;tances are finely adapted. The &s;urface of this globe does &s;carce yield &s;pontaneou&s;ly food for the greate&s;t &s;avages; but, by labour and indu&s;|try, it is made to furni&s;h not only the con|veniencies, but even the luxuries of life. In this &s;ituation, it is wi&s;ely ordered, that man &s;hould labour for him&s;elf and his family, by providing a &s;tock of nece&s;&s;aries for them, be|fore he think of &s;erving others. The great principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation directs him to this cour&s;e. Now this very di&s;po&s;ition of providing again&s;t want, which is common to man with many other creatures, involves the idea of property. The ground I culti|vate, and the hou&s;e I build, mu&s;t be con&s;ider|ed as mine, otherways I labour to no pur|po&s;e. There is a peculiar connection be|twixt a man and the fruits of his indu&s;try felt by every one; which is the very thing we call property. Were all the conveniencies of life, like air and water, provided to our hand without labour, or were we di&s;po&s;ed to labour for the publick, without any &s;elf|i&s;h
<PB N="106" REF="112">
affections, there would be no &s;en&s;e of property, at lea&s;t &s;uch a &s;en&s;e would be &s;u|perfluous and unnece&s;&s;ary. But when &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, the mo&s;t eminent of our prin|ciples of action, directs every individual to labour for him&s;elf in the fir&s;t place; man, without a &s;en&s;e or feeling of property, would be an ab&s;urd being. Every man therefore mu&s;t have a notion of property, with regard to the things acquired by his own labour, for this is the very meaning of working for one's &s;elf: property, &s;o far, is nece&s;&s;arily con|nected with &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. But the idea of property is e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame, whether it relate to my&s;elf, or to another. There is no difference, but what is felt in &s;urveying the goods of any two indifferent per&s;ons. And, were it con&s;i&s;tent for a man to have the idea of his own property, without having a notion of property in another; &s;uch a man would be a very imperfect being, and alto|gether unqualified for &s;ociety. If it could be made out, that &s;uch is the con&s;titution of mankind in general, I &s;hould be much di&s;|po&s;ed
<PB N="107" REF="113">
to believe that we were made by a for|tuitous concour&s;e of atoms. But the con|&s;titution of man is more wi&s;ely framed, and more happily adju&s;ted to his external cir|cum&s;tances. Not only man, but all provi|dent creatures who have the hording quali|ty, are endued with the &s;en&s;e or feeling of property; which effectually &s;ecures each indi|vidual, in the enjoyment of the fruits of its own labour. And accordingly we find, in peru&s;ing the hi&s;tory of mankind, as far back as we have any traces of it, that there ne|ver has been, among any people or tribe, &s;uch a thing as the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of goods in com|mon. For, even before agriculture was in|vented, when men lived upon the natural fruits of the earth, tho' the plenty of pa&s;|ture made &s;eparate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions unnece&s;&s;ary, yet individuals had their own cattle, and en|joyed the produce of their cattle &s;eparately.</P>
<P>AND it mu&s;t not be overlooked, that this &s;en&s;e of property is fortified by another prin|ciple. Every man has a peculiar affection
<PB N="108" REF="114">
for what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, exclu&s;ive of others, and for what he calls his <HI>own.</HI> He applies his skill and indu&s;try with great alacrity to im|prove his own &s;ubject: his affection to it grows with the time of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and he puts a much greater value upon it, than upon any &s;ubject of the &s;ame kind that be|longs to another.</P>
<P>HERE then is property e&s;tabli&s;hed by the con&s;titution of our nature, antecedent to all human conventions. We are led by na|ture to con&s;ider goods acquired by our indu&s;|try and labour as belonging to us, and as our own. We have the &s;en&s;e or feeling of property, and conceive the&s;e goods to be our own, ju&s;t as much as we conceive our hands, our feet, and our other members to be our own; and we have a &s;en&s;e or feeling equal|ly clear of the property of others. What is here a&s;&s;erted is a matter of fact, of which there can be no other deci&s;ive evidence, than to ap|peal to every man's own feelings. At the &s;ame time we need &s;carce any other proof of this
<PB N="109" REF="115">
fact, than that <HI>yours</HI> and <HI>mine</HI> are terms fa|miliar with the greate&s;t &s;avages, and even with children. They mu&s;t have feelings which corre&s;pond to the&s;e terms; otherways the terms would not be intelligible to them.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all that is involved in the &s;en&s;e or feeling of property. We not only &s;uffer pain in having our goods taken from us by force; for that would happen were they de&s;troyed or lo&s;t by accident. We have the feeling of <HI>wrong</HI> and <HI>inju&s;tice.</HI> The per|&s;on who robs us has the &s;ame feeling, and every mortal who beholds the action con&s;i|ders it as vicious and contrary to <HI>right.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it is not &s;ufficient to have overturn|ed the foundation of our author's doctrine. We will proceed to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon it, to &s;how how ill it hangs together.</P>
<P>AND, in the fir&s;t place, he appears to rea|&s;on not altogether con&s;i&s;tently in making out his &s;y&s;tem. He founds ju&s;tice on a general
<PB N="110" REF="116">
&s;en&s;e of common intere&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 3. p. 59.</NOTE>. And yet, at no greater di&s;tance than a few pages, he endea|vours to make out <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. 3. p. 43.</NOTE>, and does it &s;ucce&s;sful|ly, that public intere&s;t is a motive too remote and too &s;ublime to affect the generality of mankind, and to operate, with any force, in actions &s;o contrary to private intere&s;t as are frequently tho&s;e of ju&s;tice, and common ho|ne&s;ty.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, ab&s;tracting from the &s;en&s;e of property, it does not appear, that a &s;en&s;e of common intere&s;t would nece&s;&s;arily lead to &s;uch a regulation, as that every man &s;hould have the undi&s;turbed enjoyment of what he has acquired by his indu&s;try or good fortune. Suppo&s;ing no &s;en&s;e of pro|perty, I do not &s;ee it incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;oci|ety, to have a Lacedemonian con&s;titution, that every man may lawfully take what by addre&s;s he can make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of, with|out force or violence. The depriving us of that to which we have no affection, would
<PB N="111" REF="117">
be doing little more than drinking in our brook, or breathing in our air. At any rate, &s;uch a refined regulation would never be con&s;idered of importance enough, to be e|&s;tabli&s;hed, upon the very commencement of &s;ociety. It mu&s;t come late, if at all, and be the effect of long experience, and great re|finement in the art of living. It is very true, that, ab&s;taining from the goods of others is a regulation, without which &s;ociety cannot well &s;ub&s;i&s;t. But the nece&s;&s;ity of this regu|lation ari&s;es from the &s;en&s;e of property, without which a man would &s;uffer little pain in lo&s;ing his goods, and would have no feel|ing of wrong or inju&s;tice. There does not appear any way to evade the force of the a|bove rea&s;oning, other than peremptorily to deny the reality of the &s;en&s;e of property. Others may, but our author, I think, can|not with a good grace do it. An appeal may be &s;afely made to his own authority. For is it not evidently this &s;en&s;e, which has &s;ug|ge&s;ted to him the nece&s;&s;ity, in the in&s;titution of every &s;ociety, to &s;ecure individuals in their
<PB N="112" REF="118">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions? He cannot but be &s;en&s;ible, that, ab&s;tracting from the affection for property, the nece&s;&s;ity would be ju&s;t nothing at all. But our feelings operate &s;ilently and imper|ceptibly; and there is nothing more com|mon than to &s;train for far-fetched arguments in &s;upport of conclu&s;ions which are &s;ug|ge&s;ted by the &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t obvious feel|ings.</P>
<P>A THIRD ob&s;ervation is, that &s;ince our au|thor re&s;olves all virtue into &s;ympathy, why &s;hould he with-hold the &s;ame principle from being the foundation of ju&s;tice? why &s;hould not &s;ympathy give us a painful &s;en&s;ation, in depriving our neighbour of the goods he has acquired by indu&s;try, as well as in depriv|ing him of his life or limb? For it is a fact too evident to be denied, that many men are more unea&s;y at the lo&s;s of their goods, than at the lo&s;s of a member.</P>
<P>AND, in the la&s;t place, were ju&s;tice only founded on a general &s;en&s;e of common in|tere&s;t,
<PB N="113" REF="119">
it behoved to be the weake&s;t feeling in human nature, e&s;pecially where inju&s;tice committed again&s;t a &s;tranger is, with whom we are not connected by any degree of bene|volence. Now this is contrary to all experi|ence. The &s;en&s;e of inju&s;tice is one of the &s;tronge&s;t that belongs to humanity, and is attended with many peculiar modifications, <HI>viz.</HI> a feeling of acting contrary to the &s;trict|e&s;t obligations of duty, and a feeling of me|rited puni&s;hment for the wrong committed. Had our author but once reflected upon the&s;e peculiar feelings, he never could have been &s;atisfied with the &s;light foundation he gives to ju&s;tice; for the&s;e feelings are alto|gether unaccountable upon his &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THAT branch of ju&s;tice, which regards promi&s;es and covenants, appears al&s;o to have a mo&s;t &s;olid foundation in human nature; notwith&s;tanding of what is laid down by our author in two di&s;tinct propo&s;itions <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 102.</NOTE>, <Q>That a promi&s;e would not be intelligible, before
<PB N="114" REF="120">
human conventions had e&s;tabli&s;hed it; and that even, if it were intelligible, it would not be attended with any moral obligation.</Q> As man is framed for &s;ocie|ty, mutual tru&s;t and confidence, without which there can be no &s;ociety, enter into the character of the human &s;pecies. Cor|re&s;pondent to the&s;e, are the principles of ve|racity and fidelity. And, in this particular, among many, it is admirable to ob&s;erve how accurately the&s;e principles are adapted to each other. Veracity and fidelity would be of no &s;ignificancy, were men not di&s;po&s;|ed to have faith, and to rely upon what is &s;aid to them, whether in the way of evi|dence or engagement. Faith and tru&s;t, on the other hand, would be very hurtful prin|ciples, were mankind void of veracity and fidelity: for, upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, the world would be over-run with fraud and deceit. Suppo&s;ing a &s;ociety once e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, the &s;ecurity of property, as well as of life, is indeed e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to its continuance and pre&s;ervation. For, were
<PB N="115" REF="121">
men in danger from their fellows, the con|dition of man behoved to be the &s;ame with that of &s;avage animals, who, upon that very account, &s;hun all manner of commerce. But fidelity and veracity are &s;till more e&s;&s;ential to &s;ociety, becau&s;e, without the&s;e principles, there cannot be &s;uch a thing as &s;ociety at all: it could never have a beginning. 'Tis ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by our author, that man, in a &s;olitary &s;tate, is the mo&s;t helple&s;s of be|ings; and that by &s;ociety alone he is en|abled to &s;upply his defects, and to acquire a &s;uperiority over his fellow creatures; that by conjunction of forces, our power is aug|mented; by partition of employments, we work to better purpo&s;e; and, by mutual &s;uc|cour, we acquire &s;ecurity. But, without mu|tual fidelity and tru&s;t, we could enjoy none of the&s;e advantages: without them, we could not have any comfortable intercour&s;e with one another: &s;o that they are nece&s;&s;a|ry even to the con&s;titution of &s;ociety. Hence it is, that treachery is the vile&s;t of crimes, and what mankind have ever held in the
<PB N="116" REF="122">
utmo&s;t abhorrence. It is wor&s;e than mur|der, becau&s;e it forms a character, and is di|rected again&s;t all mankind; whereas, murder is only a tran&s;itory act, directed again&s;t a &s;ingle per&s;on. Infidelity is of the &s;ame &s;pe|cies with treachery. The e&s;&s;ence of both crimes is the &s;ame, to wit, breach of tru&s;t. Treachery has only this aggravating circum|&s;tance, that it turns the confidence repo&s;ed in me, again&s;t the friend who tru&s;ts me. Now breach of promi&s;e is a &s;pecies of infi|delity; and therefore our author has but a &s;ingle choice. He mu&s;t either maintain, that treachery is no crime, or that breach of promi&s;e is a crime. And, in fact, that it is &s;o, every man mu&s;t bear evidence to him|&s;elf. The performance of a deliberate pro|mi&s;e has, in all ages, been con&s;idered as a duty. We have that &s;en&s;e and feeling of a promi&s;e, as what we are bound to perform by a &s;trict obligation; and the breach of pro|mi&s;e is attended with the &s;ame natural &s;tings, which attend other crimes, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> remor&s;e, and merited puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="123">
IT is evident from the above, that it is but an imperfect conception of a promi&s;e to con&s;ider it as our author does <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 3. p. 102.</NOTE>, with rela|tion only to the per&s;on who makes the pro|mi&s;e. In this internal act two per&s;ons are concerned; the per&s;on who makes the pro|mi&s;e, and the per&s;on to whom the promi&s;e is made. Were there by nature no tru&s;t nor reliance upon promi&s;es, breach of pro|mi&s;e would be a matter of indifferency. Therefore the e&s;&s;ence of a promi&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in keeping faith. The reliance upon us, produced by our own act, con&s;titutes the obligation. We feel our&s;elves bound to per|form: we con&s;ider it as our duty. And when we violate our engagement, we have a &s;en&s;e of moral turpitude in di&s;appointing the per&s;on who relied upon our faith.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall clo&s;e this &s;ubject, concerning the foundation of ju&s;tice, with a general reflec|tion. Running over every branch of our du|ty, what concerns our&s;elves as well as our
<PB N="118" REF="124">
neighbours, we find, that nature has been more provident, than to tru&s;t us entirely to the guidance of cool rea&s;on. It is ob&s;erved above, that our duty is enforced by in&s;tinct and appetite, as well as it is directed by rea|&s;on. Now, if man be a &s;ocial being, and ju&s;tice e&s;&s;ential to &s;ociety, it is not according to the analogy of nature, that we &s;hould be left to inve&s;tigate this branch of our du|ty by a chain of rea&s;oning, e&s;pecially where the rea&s;oning turns upon &s;o remote an ob|ject as that of publick good. May we not apply to ju&s;tice, what is &s;o beautifully rea|&s;oned concerning &s;ociety, in a dialogue upon happine&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 155.</NOTE>: <Q>If &s;ociety be thus agreeable to our nature, is there nothing within us to excite and lead us to it? no impul&s;e; no preparation of faculties?

&s;ociety, it would be &s;trange if there &s;hould be no natural affections, no preparation of faculties, to direct us to do ju&s;tice, which is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to &s;ociety. But nature has not failed us here, more than in the other parts of our con&s;titution. We have a feeling of property; we have a feeling of obligation to perform our engagements; and we have a feeling of wrong in encroaching upon pro|perty, and in being untrue to our engage|ments. Society could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the&s;e affections, more than it could &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the &s;ocial affections properly &s;o call|ed.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Of the</HI> PRIMARY LAWS <HI>of</HI> NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now come to the thing princi|pally intended in this e&s;&s;ay, which is to give a general view of the primary laws of nature. Action ought to be the end and aim of all our inquiries; without which, moral, as well as metaphy&s;ical, rea&s;onings are but empty &s;peculation. And, as life and man|ners are more peculiarly the object of the moral &s;cience, it was to be expected, that the weight and importance of the &s;ubject, &s;hould have brought authors to one way of think|ing. But it is lamentable to find the world divided about the&s;e primary laws, almo&s;t as much as they commonly are about the mo&s;t airy and ab&s;tract points. Some au|thors acknowledge no principle in man, but what is altogether &s;elfi&s;h; and it is curious to ob&s;erve how they wre&s;t and torture every &s;o|cial principle, to give it the appearance of &s;el|fi&s;hne&s;s. Others exalt human nature much
<PB N="121" REF="127">
bove its ju&s;t &s;tandard, give no quarter to &s;el|fi&s;hne&s;s, but con&s;ider man as bound to di|rect every action to the good of the whole, and not to prefer his own intere&s;t to that of others. The celebrated lord <HI>Shaftesbury</HI> goes &s;o far as not to admit of any thing like par|tial benevolence; holding, that if it is not entire, and directed to the whole &s;pecies, it is not benevolence at all. It is not difficult to a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e for &s;uch difference in opini|on; tho' it may appear &s;trange, that authors &s;hould differ &s;o widely upon a &s;ubject, which every man ought to be acquainted with, be|cau&s;e the &s;ubject is his own con&s;titution. There is nothing more common in philo&s;o|phy, as well as in life and action, than to build ca&s;tles in the air. Impatient of the &s;low and cold method of induction, we fly to &s;y&s;tems, which every writer takes the liber|ty of framing, according to his own ta&s;te and fancy. Fond of the fabric which he him|&s;elf has erected, 'tis far from his thoughts to &s;ubject it to examination, by trying whe|ther
<PB N="122" REF="128">
it will &s;tand the te&s;t of &s;tubborn facts. Men of narrow minds and contracted prin|ciples, naturally fall in with the &s;elfi&s;h &s;y&s;|tem. The &s;y&s;tem of univer&s;al benevolence attracts the generous and warm-hearted. In the mid&s;t of various and oppo&s;ite opinions, the purpo&s;e of this e&s;&s;ay is to &s;earch for truth by the patient method of induction; and, after what is above laid down, it will not be difficult to find it.</P>
<P>LET us only recapitulate, that the princi|ples of action furni&s;h motives to action, and that the moral &s;en&s;e is given as an in&s;truc|tor to regulate our actions, to enforce one motive, to re&s;train another, and to prefer one to another, when they are in competiti|on. Hence the laws of nature may be de|fined to be <HI>rules of our conduct and behaviour, founded on natural principles, approved of by the moral &s;en&s;e, and enforced by natural re|wards and puni&s;hments.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="129">
IN &s;earching for the&s;e laws, it mu&s;t be obvious, that we <HI>may</HI> &s;afely indulge every principle of action, where the action is not di&s;approved of by the moral &s;en&s;e, and that we <HI>ought</HI> to perform every action which the moral &s;en&s;e informs us to be our duty. From this &s;hort propo&s;ition, may be readily deduced all the laws of nature which go|vern human actions. Tho', in the pre&s;ent e&s;&s;ay, the duty which a man owes to him&s;elf, where others are not concerned, is not com|prehended.</P>
<P>AND, with regard to our general principles of action, &s;elf-pre&s;ervation being the leading principle, it is hard to &s;ay, that any means, &s;trictly &s;peaking, are unlawful, to attain that end. If two men in a &s;hip-wreck get hold at the &s;ame in&s;tant of a plank, which is not bul|ky enough to &s;upport both, it is lawful for the one to thru&s;t off the other, in order to &s;ave his own life. This action is not con|demned by the moral &s;en&s;e: It is not at|tended with any feeling of wrong. In like
<PB N="124" REF="130">
manner, it is lawful for a man to &s;eize upon food wherever he can find it, to keep him|&s;elf from dying of hunger.</P>
<P>UPON the &s;ame principle, it is lawful for a man to &s;ave a member of his own body, at the expence of another's member, if both cannot be &s;aved. A man will &s;carce have a|ny con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of wrong in &s;o doing. But it will hardly be allowed in morality, to &s;ave a member at the expence of another's life. This matter, however, is not to be reduced to any accurate rule. The determination of que&s;tions of this kind, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily vary according to the circum&s;tances of the per|&s;ons concerned, and according to the tem|per and di&s;po&s;ition of the actor.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd general principle in point of rank is &s;elf-love, which, being a more pow|erful principle than benevolence, it naturally a&s;&s;umes the preference. And we meet with no ob&s;truction from the moral &s;en&s;e, when we prefer our own intere&s;t to that of others.
<PB N="125" REF="131">
The &s;ame will hold with regard to our par|ticular appetites, pa&s;&s;ions and affections. But here comes a remarkable limitation, that we are not to indulge &s;elf-love at the expence of harming others, whether in their per&s;ons, goods, or reputation. The moral &s;en&s;e, in every ca&s;e, &s;elf-pre&s;ervation excepted, lays us under an ab&s;olute re&s;traint with regard to the&s;e particulars. This re&s;traint is felt as our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty, and the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of this duty never fails to be attended with re|mor&s;e, and a dread of merited puni&s;hment. And this is wi&s;ely ordered. Society could not be pre&s;erved without &s;uch a law; and e|ven, ab&s;tracting from &s;ociety, the law is e&s;|&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, to attain the ends propo&s;|ed by the two great principles of action, &s;elf-pre&s;ervation and &s;elf-love. No man could be &s;ecure of his life a moment, far le&s;s of his happine&s;s, if men, wor&s;e than &s;avage bea&s;ts, preyed upon one another.</P>
<P>THE third principle, which is that of fi|delity, is al&s;o in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e a law of
<PB N="126" REF="132">
nature. We are bound to take care of our children, to perform our promi&s;es, and to &s;tand true to our engagements. It need only be ob&s;erved upon this head, that the obli|gation is indi&s;pen&s;ible, and yields to no other principle or law of nature, if it be not &s;elf-pre&s;ervation alone.</P>
<P>GRATITUDE, the fourth principle, is like|ways to be ranked among the laws of na|ture. We feel it in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e as our duty. The tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of this law is not only attended with &s;elf-di&s;approbation, but with hatred and contempt from others.</P>
<P>BENEVOLENCE, the la&s;t principle, may be indulged at plea&s;ure, and without re&s;traint, unle&s;s where it comes in competition with a &s;trict obligation. If it is directed to advance the happine&s;s of others; it is not to be rank|ed, &s;trictly &s;peaking, among our duties. Be|cau&s;e, tho' actions of this kind are highly re|warded by &s;elf-approbation, and the love of others, yet the neglect of them is not at|tended
<PB N="127" REF="133">
with remor&s;e or puni&s;hment. It is true, that a per&s;on of a &s;ociable and gene|rous temper, will be &s;trongly impelled to ac|tions of this kind, and will feel pain and unea&s;ine&s;s upon reflecting, that he has not been &s;o u&s;eful to his friends, his country, or mankind, as he might have been. But this unea&s;ine&s;s does not ari&s;e to what is properly called remor&s;e, or &s;elf-condemnation, tho' it may, in &s;ome in&s;tances, approach to it. There is undoubtedly a di&s;tinction here, tho' it be not ea&s;y to a&s;certain the preci&s;e limits of feelings that are &s;o much allied to one ano|ther, any more than it is to fix the exact boundary betwixt light and darkne&s;s, or to di&s;tingui&s;h the very la&s;t &s;hade of any colour in tints that run into each other. To in|&s;tance in another ca&s;e, which belongs to the &s;ame head of benevolence. We are oblig|ed to provide for our children; it is &s;trict duty, and the neglect of it cau&s;es remor&s;e. In the ca&s;e of an only brother, &s;uppo&s;e, or &s;ome very near friend who depends entirely on our help, we feel &s;omewhat of the &s;ame
<PB N="128" REF="134">
kind of obligation, tho' in a weaker degree; and thus, thro' other connections, it dimi|ni&s;hes by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive gradations, 'till at la&s;t the motive to benevolence is lo&s;t in &s;imple ap|probation, without any obligatory feeling. This is univer&s;ally the cour&s;e which nature holds. Her tran&s;itions are &s;oft and gentle; &s;he makes things approximate &s;o nicely one to another, as to leave no gap or cha&s;m. Where the object of the&s;e feelings can be clearly and fully di&s;tingui&s;hed, it may be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted, that, in the general ca&s;e, of procuring po&s;itive good to others, or ad|vancing happine&s;s, it is &s;elf-approbation and not &s;trict obligation that is felt. But where the object of benevolence is di&s;tre&s;s, there it becomes a duty, provided it is in our pow|er to afford relief without hurting our&s;elves. The neglect of &s;uch an action is certainly at|tended with remor&s;e and &s;elf-condemnation; tho' po&s;&s;ibly, not of &s;o &s;trong a kind, as where we betray our tru&s;t, or are the au|thors of po&s;itive mi&s;chief to others. Thus
<PB N="129" REF="135">
charity is, by all mankind, con&s;idered as a duty to which we are &s;trictly bound.</P>
<P>THESE are the out-lines of the laws which govern our actions, comprehending both what we <HI>may do,</HI> and what we <HI>ought</HI> to do. And now, dropping the former to be indulg|ed by every one at plea&s;ure without re&s;traint, we &s;hall confine our&s;elves to the latter, as the more proper &s;ubject of laws, both na|tural and municipal. And no more &s;eems to be requi&s;ite in this matter, than clearly to point out our duty, by informing us of what we ought to do, and what we ought not to do; &s;eeing actions, which come not under the character of duty, may be &s;afely left to our own choice. With regard then to what may be called our duty, the fir&s;t and primary law is the law of re&s;traint, by which we are prohibited to hurt others in their per&s;ons, goods, or whatever el&s;e is dear to them. The &s;econd is a po&s;itive law, that we ought to relieve tho&s;e in di&s;tre&s;s. The
<PB N="130" REF="136">
omi&s;&s;ion of this duty does not, <HI>coeteris pari|bus,</HI> affect us &s;o &s;trongly with the &s;en&s;e of wrong, as the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion does of the for|mer law. Becau&s;e the creating of po&s;itive pain has a greater effect upon the mind, than merely the forbearing to relieve others from pain; as there is a clo&s;er connection in the imagination betwixt a man and his actions, than betwixt a man and any action he forbears to do. Fidelity comes, in the third place, as a po&s;itive duty, comprehend|ing the care of our offspring, performance of promi&s;es, executing tru&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Gratitude takes up the fourth place of po&s;itive duty. And that branch of benevolence having for its object the advancing the good of others, takes up the la&s;t place, which, if at all to be ranked among our duties, is then only to be ranked, when it is applied to tho&s;e who are nearly connected with us, and to general objects, &s;uch as our town, our religion, our government.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="137">
THESE &s;everal laws are admirably adju&s;t|ed to our nature and circum&s;tances, and tend in the mo&s;t perfect manner to promote the ends of &s;ociety. In the fir&s;t place, as man is limited with regard to power and capacity, the above laws are accommodated to his na|ture, ordering and forbidding nothing but what falls within his compa&s;s. In the &s;econd place, peace and &s;ecurity in &s;ociety are am|ply provided for, by tying up the hands, as it were, of every man from harming others. In the third place, man is prompted to the utmo&s;t of his ability to be u&s;eful to others. 'Tis his po&s;itive duty to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and perform his engagements. And he is incited to do all the good he can by the plea&s;ure of the action, by benevolence and gratitude from the per&s;ons obliged. And la&s;tly, in competition betwixt him&s;elf and others, tho' his principles of action directed upon him&s;elf, may be &s;tronger than tho&s;e directed upon others, the &s;uperior rewards be&s;towed by the con&s;titution of our nature
<PB N="132" REF="138">
upon the latter, may be deemed a &s;uffici|ent counter-balance to give an a&s;cendent to the &s;ocial affections.</P>
<P>IT may &s;eem &s;trange, that the municipal law of all countries is &s;o little regardful of the laws of nature, as to adopt but a very few of them. There never was a po&s;itive law in any country, to puni&s;h ingratitude, if it was not among the antient Per&s;ians. There is no po&s;itive law to enforce compa&s;&s;ion, and to relieve tho&s;e in di&s;tre&s;s, if the main|tenance of the poor be excepted, which, in &s;ome countries, is provided for by law. No notice is taken of breach of friend&s;hip, by &s;tatute, nor of the duty we owe our children, further than of &s;upporting them while they are under age. But municipal laws, being of human invention, are of no great extent. They cannot reach the heart, nor its inten|tions, further than as expre&s;t by outward acts. And the&s;e are to be judged of cauti|ou&s;ly, and with re&s;erve; becau&s;e they form
<PB N="133" REF="139">
a language, dark, and at be&s;t full of ambigu|ities. At the &s;ame time, the object of hu|man laws is man, con&s;idered &s;ingly in the quality of a citizen. When &s;ociety is form|ed, and government &s;ubmitted to, every pri|vate right is given up, incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;o|ciety and government. But, in every other re&s;pect, individuals re&s;erve their independen|cy and their private rights. Whether a man be virtuous, is not the concern of the &s;ocie|ty, at lea&s;t not of its laws; but only whe|ther he tran&s;gre&s;s tho&s;e regulations, which are nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of &s;ociety. In this view, great attention is given by the legi&s;lature in every country, to enforce the natural law of re&s;traint from mutual hurt and injury. The like attention is given, to enforce the natural obligation of fidelity, at lea&s;t &s;o far as relates to commerce; for, infi|delity in love and friend&s;hip are left to the natural law. Ingratitude is not puni&s;hed by human laws; becau&s;e it may be guard|ed again&s;t by po&s;itive engagements; nor
<PB N="134" REF="140">
hard-heartedne&s;s with regard to objects of di&s;tre&s;s, becau&s;e &s;ociety may &s;ub&s;i&s;t without &s;uch a law; and mankind are &s;carce yet ar|rived at &s;uch refinement in manners, as to have an abhorrence of this crime, &s;ufficient to make it an object of human puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>THERE is another &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on, which confines human laws within a much narrower compa&s;s, than the laws of nature. It is e&s;&s;ential to human laws, that they be clear, plain, and readily applicable to parti|cular ca&s;es; without which, judges would be arbitrary, and law made a handle for oppre&s;|&s;ion. For this rea&s;on, none of our actions can be the object of po&s;itive law, but what are reducible to a preci&s;e rule. Ingratitude therefore cannot be the object of human laws, becau&s;e the quality of the crime de|pends upon a multiplicity of circum&s;tances, which can never be reduced to a preci&s;e rule. Duty to our children, friends and relations is, with regard to mo&s;t circum&s;tances, in the

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>Of the</HI> LAW <HI>of</HI> NATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IF we can tru&s;t hi&s;tory, the original inha|bitants of this earth were a bruti&s;h and &s;avage race. And we have little rea&s;on to doubt of the fact, when, even at this day, we find the &s;ame &s;ort of people in di&s;tant corners, who have no communication with the re&s;t of mankind. The &s;tate of nature is accordingly repre&s;ented by all writers, as a &s;tate of war; nothing going on but rapine and blood&s;hed. From this picture of the fir&s;t men, one would be apt to conclude, that man, by nature, is a wild and rapacious animal, little better than a bea&s;t of prey, but, for his inclination to &s;ociety, which moulds him gradually into a rational creature. If this conclu&s;ion be ju&s;t, we cannot help being in &s;ome pain for the principles above laid down. Bruti&s;h manners imply bruti&s;h prin|ciples of action; and, from this view of the original &s;tate of mankind, it may &s;eem that
<PB N="137" REF="143">
moral virtues are not natural, but acquired by means of education and example in a well regulated &s;ociety. In a word, that the whole moral part of our &s;y&s;tem is artificial, as ju&s;tice is repre&s;ented by a late writer.</P>
<P>BUT to be &s;atisfied of the fallacy of this conclu&s;ion, we need only look back to what has already been &s;aid upon the moral &s;en&s;e. If the feeling of beauty and defor|mity in external exi&s;tences be natural to man, the feeling of beauty and deformity, and of a <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> in actions, is equ|ally &s;o. And indeed, whatever be the influ|ence of education and example, 'tis an evident truth, that they can never have the power of creating any one &s;en&s;e or feeling. They may well have the effect of cheri&s;hing and improving the plants of nature's formation, but they cannot introduce any new or ori|ginal plant whatever. We mu&s;t therefore attribute the above appearances to &s;ome other cau&s;e than want of the moral &s;en&s;e; and the&s;e appearances may ea&s;ily be accounted
<PB N="138" REF="144">
for, from peculiar circum&s;tances, that are &s;ufficient to over-balance the mo&s;t vigorous operations of the moral &s;en&s;e, and to pro|duce, in a good mea&s;ure, the &s;ame effects which would re&s;ult from a total ab&s;ence of that &s;en&s;e. Let us point out the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces, for the &s;ubject is worthy of our &s;tricte&s;t attention. The original &s;ituation of man|kind will, in the fir&s;t place, be attended to, when the earth was uncultivated, and in a great mea&s;ure barren; when there was a &s;carcity of in&s;truments for rai&s;ing habitati|ons, and a greater &s;carcity of manufactures to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of life. In this &s;tate, man was a mo&s;t indigent creature, and, up|on the principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, intitled to &s;upply his wants the be&s;t way he could, without any ob&s;truction from the moral &s;en&s;e. Thus there behoved to be a con|&s;tant oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts, and of con&s;e|quence perpetual di&s;cord. At the &s;ame time there being no e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of conduct to appeal to, nor judges to apply rules to particular ca&s;es, wars of old behoved to be
<PB N="139" REF="145">
at lea&s;t as frequent as law &s;uits are at pre|&s;ent. In this &s;tate, barbarity, roughne&s;s, and cruelty formed the character of the hu|man &s;pecies. For, in the practice and ha|bit of war, the malevolent principles gain &s;trength and vigour, as the benevolent prin|ciples, do by the arts of peace. And to this con&s;ideration may be added, that man is by nature &s;hy and timorous, and con&s;equently cruel when he gets the upper-hand. The &s;ecurity obtained in &s;ociety puts an end in a great mea&s;ure to our fears. Man becomes a magnanimous and generous creature, not ea&s;ily daunted, and therefore not ea&s;ily pro|voked to acts of cruelty.</P>
<P>IT may be ob&s;erved, in the next place, that the rude and illiterate are governed by their appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, more than by general principles. We have our fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions from particular objects. 'Tis by education and practice that we acquire a fa|cility in forming complex ideas, and ab&s;tract propo&s;itions. The ideas of a common inte|re&s;t,
<PB N="140" REF="146">
of a country, of a people, of a &s;ociety under government, of publick good, are complex, and not &s;oon acquired even by the thinking part of mankind. They are &s;carce ever to be acquired by the rude and illite|rate; and con&s;equently do not readily be|come the object of any of their affections. One's own intere&s;t, con&s;idered in general, is too complex an object for the bulk of man|kind; and therefore it is, that the particular appetites and pa&s;&s;ions are &s;tronger motives to action with the ignorant and unthinking, than the principle of &s;elf-love, or even than of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, when it is not incited by &s;ome particular object which threatens danger. And the &s;ame mu&s;t hold more &s;trongly with regard to the affections of be|nevolence, charity and &s;uch like, when there is no particular object in view, but only in general the good of others.</P>
<P>MAN is a complex machine, compo&s;ed of various principles of motion, which may be conceived as &s;o many &s;prings and weights,
<PB N="141" REF="147">
counteracting and balancing one another. The&s;e being accurately adju&s;ted, the move|ment of life is beautiful, becau&s;e regular and uniform. But if &s;ome &s;prings or weights be withdrawn, tho&s;e which remain, acting now without oppo&s;ition from their antagoni&s;t forces, will di&s;order the balance, and derange the whole machine. Remove tho&s;e princi|ples of action which operate by reflection, and who&s;e objects are complex and general ideas, and the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence will be, to double the force of the appetites and pa&s;|&s;ions, pointing at particular objects; which is always the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who act by &s;en&s;e, and not by reflection. They are ty|ranni&s;ed by pa&s;&s;ion and appetite, and have no con&s;i&s;tent rule of conduct. No wonder, that the moral &s;en&s;e is of no &s;ufficient au|thority to command obedience in &s;uch a ca&s;e. This is the character of &s;avages. We have no rea&s;on then to conclude, from the a|bove picture, that even the greate&s;t &s;avages are de&s;titute of the moral &s;en&s;e. Their defect rather lies in the weakne&s;s of their general
<PB N="142" REF="148">
principles of action, which terminate in ob|jects too complex for &s;avages readily to com|prehend. This defect is remedied by educati|on and reflection; and then it is, that the mo|ral &s;en&s;e, in concert with the&s;e general princi|ples, acquires its full authority, which is op|enly recogni&s;ed, and chearfully &s;ubmitted to.</P>
<P>THE contemplation is beautiful, when we compare our gradual improvement in know|ledge and in morality We begin with &s;ur|veying particular objects, and lay in a &s;tock of &s;imple ideas. Our affections keep pace, being all directed to particular objects; and, during this period, we are governed princi|pally by our pa&s;&s;ions and appetites. So &s;oon as we begin to form complex and ge|neral ideas, the&s;e al&s;o become the objects of our affections. Then it is, that love to our country begins to exert it&s;elf, benevo|lence to our neighbours and acquaintances, affection to our relations as &s;uch. We ac|quire by degrees the ta&s;te of public good, and of being u&s;eful in life. The plea&s;ures of
<PB N="143" REF="149">
&s;ociety thicken upon us. The &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;i|ons are tamed and &s;ubdued, and the &s;ocial affections gain the a&s;cendant. We refine upon the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, becau&s;e our happine&s;s principally con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ocial inter|cour&s;e. We learn to &s;ubmit our opinions. We affect to give preference to others, and readily accommodate our&s;elves to every thing which may render &s;ociety more complete. The malevolent pa&s;&s;ions, above all, are brought under the &s;tricte&s;t culture, if not to|tally eradicated. In&s;tead of unbounded re|venge for the &s;malle&s;t injury, we acquire a degree of &s;elf-denial to overlook trifling wrongs, and in greater wrongs to be &s;atisfi|ed with moderate reparation.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, it is true, that the mo|ral &s;en&s;e, tho' rooted in the nature of man, admits of great refinements by culture and education. It improves gradually like our other powers and faculties, 'till it comes to be productive of the &s;tronge&s;t as well as mo&s;t delicate feelings. To clear this point, eve|ry
<PB N="144" REF="150">
one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the great advan|tages of education and imitation. The mo&s;t poli&s;hed nations differ only from &s;avages in refinement of ta&s;te, which, being productive of nice and delicate feelings, is the &s;ource of plea&s;ure and pain, more exqui&s;ite than &s;ava|ges are &s;u&s;ceptible of. Hence it is, that ma|ny actions, which make little impre&s;&s;ion up|on &s;avages, appear to us elegant and beauti|ful. As, on the other hand, actions, which give them no pain, rai&s;e in us aver&s;ion and di&s;|gu&s;t. This may be illu&s;trated by a compa|ri&s;on betwixt the Engli&s;h and French dra|matic performances. The Engli&s;h, a rough and hardy people, take delight in repre&s;en|tations, which more refined manners render in&s;upportable to their neighbours. The di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, on the other hand, repre&s;ented on the French theatre, are too &s;light for an En|gli&s;h audience. Their pa&s;&s;ions are not rai&s;|ed: they feel no concern. In general, hor|ror, which denotes the highe&s;t degree of pain and aver&s;ion that can be rai&s;ed by a har&s;h action, is a pa&s;&s;ion &s;eldom felt among
<PB N="145" REF="151">
fierce and &s;avage nations where humanity is little regarded. But, when the tender affec|tions are improved by &s;ociety, horror is more ea&s;ily rai&s;ed, and objects which move hor|ror become more frequent.</P>
<P>THE moral &s;en&s;e not only accompanies our other &s;en&s;es in their gradual refinement, but receives additional &s;trength upon every oc|ca&s;ion from the&s;e other &s;en&s;es. For example, a &s;avage, enured to acts of cruelty, feels little pain or aver&s;ion in putting an enemy to death in cold blood, and con&s;equently will have no remor&s;e at &s;uch an action, other than what proceeds from the moral &s;en&s;e, acting by its native &s;trength. But let us &s;uppo&s;e a per|&s;on of &s;o delicate feelings, as &s;carce to en|dure a common operation of phlebotomy, and who cannot behold, without &s;ome de|gree of horror, the amputation of a frac|tured member; &s;uch a per&s;on will be &s;hock|ed to the highe&s;t degree, if he &s;ee an enemy put to death in cold blood. The grating e|motion, thus rai&s;ed in him, mu&s;t communi|cate
<PB N="146" REF="152">
it&s;elf to the feelings of the moral &s;en&s;e, and render them much more acute. And thus, refinement in ta&s;te and manners, ope|rating by communication upon the moral &s;en&s;e, occa&s;ions a &s;tronger feeling of immo|rality in every vicious action, than what would ari&s;e before &s;uch refinement. At the &s;ame time, the moral &s;en&s;e improves in its delicacy, as well as the other &s;en&s;es; where|by a double effect is produced, owing to a double cau&s;e. And therefore, upon the whole, the operations of the moral &s;en&s;e in a &s;avage, bear no proportion to its operations in a per&s;on, who &s;tands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the advantages which human nature is &s;u&s;cep|tible of by refined education.</P>
<P>I NEVER was &s;atisfied with the de&s;cripti|on given of the law of nations, commonly &s;o called, that it is a law e&s;tabli&s;hed among na|tions by common con&s;ent, for regulating their conduct with regard to each other. This foundation of the law of nations I take to be chimerical. For, upon what occa&s;ion
<PB N="147" REF="153">
was this covenant made, and by whom? If it be &s;aid, that the &s;en&s;e of common good gradually brought this law into force; I an&s;wer, That the &s;en&s;e of common good is too complex, and too remote an object to be a &s;olid foundation for any po&s;itive law, if it has no other foundation in our na|ture. But there is no nece&s;&s;ity to recur to &s;o &s;lender a foundation. What is ju&s;t now ob&s;erved will lead us to a more rational ac|count of the&s;e laws. They are no other but gradual refinements of the original law of nature, accommodating it&s;elf to the im|proved &s;tate of mankind. The law of na|ture, which is the law of our nature, can|not be &s;tationary. It mu&s;t vary with the nature of man, and con&s;equently refine gra|dually as human nature refines. Putting an enemy to death in cold blood, is now look|ed upon with di&s;ta&s;te and horror, and there|fore is immoral; tho' it was not always &s;o in the &s;ame degree. It is con&s;idered as barba|rous and inhuman, to fight with poi&s;oned weapons, and therefore is more remarkably
<PB N="148" REF="154">
di&s;approved of by the moral &s;en&s;e, than it was originally. Influenced by general ob|jects, we have enmity again&s;t France, which is our natural enemy; but this enmity is not directed again&s;t individuals; con&s;cious as we are, that it is the duty of &s;ubjects to &s;erve their king and country. Therefore we treat pri&s;oners of war with humanity. And now it is creeping in among civilized nations, that, in war, a cartel &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed for exchange of pri&s;oners. The function of an emba&s;&s;ador has ever been held &s;acred. To treat him ill was originally immoral, becau&s;e it is treating as an enemy the man who comes to us with friendly intentions. But the improved manners of latter times, have refined upon the privileges of an em|ba&s;&s;ador, and extended them far beyond what they were originally. It is very true, that the&s;e refinements of the law of na|ture gain &s;trength and firmne&s;s by cu&s;tom. Hereby they acquire the additional &s;upport of common con&s;ent. For, as every nation tru&s;ts that the&s;e laws will be ob&s;erved, it is
<PB N="149" REF="155">
upon that account a breach of faith to tran&s;|gre&s;s them. But this is not peculiar to the&s;e particular in&s;titutions which pa&s;s under the name of the law of nations. There is the &s;ame adventitious foundation for all the laws of nature, which every man tru&s;ts will be ob&s;erved, and upon that faith directs his con|duct.</P>

<P>WHEN we apply our thoughts to the contemplation of final cau&s;es, no &s;ubject more readily pre&s;ents it&s;elf than the natural world, which is &s;tamped with the brighte&s;t characters of wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. The moral world, being le&s;s in view, has been generally overlooked, tho' it yields not to the other in rich materials. Man's in|ward &s;y&s;tem, accurately &s;urveyed, will be found not le&s;s admirable than the external &s;y&s;tem, of which he makes a part. The &s;ubject is the more curious, that the traces of wi&s;dom and de&s;ign, di&s;cernible in our in|ternal frame, ly more out of common &s;ight. They are touches, as it were, of a finer pencil, and of a nicer hand, than are di&s;co|vered in the natural world. Thought is more &s;ubtile than motion, and more of exqui&s;ite art is di&s;played in the laws of voluntary ac|tion,
<PB N="152" REF="157">
than there is place for in adju&s;ting the laws of mere matter.</P>
<P>AN extreme beautiful &s;cene opens to our view, when we con&s;ider with what proprie|ty the ideas, feelings, and whole con&s;tituti|on of the mind of man, corre&s;pond to his pre&s;ent &s;tate. The impre&s;&s;ions he receives, and the notions he forms, are accurately ad|apted to the u&s;eful purpo&s;es of life, tho' they do not corre&s;pond in every in&s;tance to the philo&s;ophic truth of things. It was not intended that man &s;hould make profound di&s;coveries. He is framed to be more an active than a contemplative being; and his views both of the natural and moral world are &s;o adju&s;ted, as to be made &s;ub&s;ervient to correctne&s;s of action rather than of belief. Several in&s;tances there are of perceptions, which, for want of a more proper term, may be called deceitful; becau&s;e they differ from the real truth. But man is not there|by in the lea&s;t mi&s;led. On the contrary, the ends of life and action are better pro|vided
<PB N="153" REF="158">
for by &s;uch artifice, than if the&s;e per|ceptions were more exact copies of their ob|jects.</P>
<P>IN the natural world, &s;omewhat of this kind is generally admitted by modern phi|lo&s;ophers. It is found, that the repre&s;entati|ons of external objects, and their qualities conveyed by the &s;en&s;es, &s;ometimes differ from what philo&s;ophy di&s;covers the&s;e ob|jects, and their qualities to be. Thus a &s;ur|face appears &s;mooth and uniform, when its roughne&s;s is not &s;uch as to be hurtful. The &s;ame &s;urface, examined with a micro&s;cope, is found to be full of ridges and hollows. Were man endowed with a micro&s;copic eye, the bodies that &s;urround him, would appear as different from what they do at pre&s;ent, as if he were tran&s;ported into another world. His ideas, upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, would in|deed be more agreeable to &s;trict truth, but they would be far le&s;s &s;erviceable in com|mon life. Further, it is now univer&s;ally admitted, that the qualities called &s;ecundary,
<PB N="154" REF="159">
which we by natural in&s;tinct attribute to matter, belong not properly to matter, nor exi&s;t really without us. Colour in particular is a &s;ort of vi&s;ionary beauty, which nature has &s;pread over all her works. It is a wonderful artifice, to pre&s;ent objects to us thus differently di&s;tingui&s;hed: to mark them out to the eye in various attires, &s;o as to be be&s;t known and remembered: and to paint on the fancy, gay and lively, grand and &s;triking, or &s;ober and melancholy &s;cenes: whence many of our mo&s;t plea&s;urable and mo&s;t affecting &s;en&s;ations ari&s;e. Yet all this beauty of colours, with which heaven and earth appear clothed, is a &s;ort of romance and illu&s;ion. For, among external objects, to which colours are attributed by &s;en&s;e, there is really no other di&s;tinction, than what ari&s;es from a difference in the &s;ize and ar|rangement of the con&s;tituent parts, where|by the rays of light, are reflected or re|fracted in &s;uch different ways, as to paint various colours on the retina of the eye. From this, and other in&s;tances of the &s;ame kind which might be adduced, it appears,
<PB N="155" REF="160">
that our perceptions &s;ome times, are le&s;s ac|commodated to the truth of things, than to the end for which our &s;en&s;es are de&s;igned. Nature, at the &s;ame time, has provided a re|medy; for &s;he &s;eldom or never leaves us without means of di&s;covering the deception, and arriving at the truth. And it is won|derful, that, even when we act upon the&s;e de|ceitful impre&s;&s;ions, we are not betrayed in|to any thing that is hurtful. On the con|trary, life and action are better provided for, and the ends of our being fulfilled to more advantage, than if we conducted our&s;elves by the &s;tricte&s;t truth of things.</P>
<P>LET us carry on this &s;peculation from the natural to the moral world, and examine whether there are not here al&s;o, analogous in&s;tances of deceitful impre&s;&s;ions. This will lead us into an unbeaten tract. We are to open a &s;cene entirely new; which, like mo&s;t other things that are new, may perhaps &s;urprize the reader. But he will &s;u&s;pend his judgment, 'till he has lei&s;urely reviewed
<PB N="156" REF="161">
the whole: and then let him pronounce, whether our hypothe&s;is does not &s;olve all the phoenomena: whether it does not tally with the nature of man, and illu&s;trate the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the author of his nature.</P>
<P>That nothing can happen without a cau&s;e, is a principle embraced by all men, the illi|terate and ignorant as well as the learned. Nothing that happens is conceived as hap|pening of it&s;elf, but as an <HI>effect</HI> produced by &s;ome other thing. However ignorant of the cau&s;e, we notwith&s;tanding conclude, that every event mu&s;t have a cau&s;e. We &s;hould perhaps be at a lo&s;s to deduce this principle, from any premi&s;es, by a chain of rea&s;oning: but feeling affords conviction, where rea&s;on leaves us in the dark. We perceive, we feel the propo&s;ition to be true. And, indeed, a &s;entiment, common to all, mu&s;t be founded on the common nature of all. Curio&s;ity is one of the earlie&s;t pa&s;&s;ions that are di&s;covered in children; and their
<PB N="157" REF="162">
curio&s;ity runs on nothing more than to have cau&s;es and rea&s;ons given them, why &s;uch a thing happened, or how it came about. Hi&s;torians and politicians make it their chief concern, to trace the cau&s;es, of actions, the mo&s;t my&s;terious not excepted. Be an event ever &s;o extraordinary, the feeling of its be|ing an effect, is not in the lea&s;t weakened, even with the vulgar, who, rather than a&s;|&s;ign no cau&s;e, recur to the operation of in|vi&s;ible powers. What is a cau&s;e with re|&s;pect to its proper effect, is con&s;idered as an effect with re&s;pect to &s;ome prior cau&s;e, and &s;o backward without end. Events thus viewed, in a train of cau&s;es and effects, &s;hould naturally be con&s;idered, one would think, as nece&s;&s;ary and fixed: for the relation be|twixt a cau&s;e and its effect implies &s;ome|what preci&s;e and determinate, and leads our thoughts to what mu&s;t be, and cannot be o|therways than it is.</P>
<P>That we have &s;uch a feeling as is above de&s;cribed, is not to be controverted: and
<PB N="158" REF="163">
yet, when we &s;earch further into human nature, a feeling of an oppo&s;ite kind is di&s;|covered, a feeling of chance or contingency in events; which is not le&s;s deeply rooted in our nature than the former. However &s;trange it may appear, that man &s;hould be com|po&s;ed of &s;uch incon&s;i&s;tencies, the fact mu&s;t notwith&s;tanding be admitted. This feeling of chance or contingency is mo&s;t con&s;picu|ous, when we look forward to future events. Some things we indeed always con&s;ider, as certain or nece&s;&s;ary, &s;uch as the revoluti|on of &s;ea&s;ons, and the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the &s;un. The&s;e, as experience teaches, are regulated by fixed laws. But many things ap|pear to us loo&s;e, fortuitous, uncertain. Uncer|tain not only with re&s;pect to us, on account of our ignorance of the cau&s;e, but uncertain in them&s;elves, or not tied down, and prede|termined to fall out, by any invariable law. We naturally make a di&s;tinction betwixt things that <HI>mu&s;t be,</HI> and things that <HI>may be,</HI> or <HI>may not be.</HI> Thus we have a feeling of chance or of contingency in events, in which
<PB N="159" REF="164">
that other feeling, of the dependency of e|vents upon preci&s;e and determinate cau&s;es, appears to be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider in what view our own actions are perceived by the mind, there is &s;omething which is equally &s;trange and &s;urpri&s;ing. It is admitted by all men, that we act from motives. The plain man, as well as the philo&s;opher, feels the connecti|on betwixt an action and its motive, to be &s;o &s;trong, that, from this feeling, both of them rea&s;on with full confidence about the future actions of others. That an avariti|ous man, will take every fair opportunity of acquiring riches, is as little doubted, as that rain and &s;un-&s;hine will make plants grow. Why, but becau&s;e the motive of gain, is judged to operate, as certainly and infallibly, upon his temper, as heat and moi&s;ture upon the &s;oil, each to produce its proper effect? If we are uncertain what part a man will act, the uncertainty ari&s;es, not from our doubting whether he will act from a mo|tive;

for this is never called in que&s;tion: it ari&s;es from our not being able to judge, what the motive is, which, in his pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances, will prevail. It being then a natu|ral feeling, that actions are &s;o connected with their proper motives, as nece&s;&s;arily to ari&s;e from the temper, character, and other cir|cum&s;tances of the agent, it &s;hould &s;eem, that all the train of human actions, would occur to our minds as nece&s;&s;ary and fixed. Yet human actions do not always appear to us in this light. It is a matter of fact, that the feeling varies, according to the dif|ferent po&s;itions of the object. Previous to any particular action, we indeed always judge, that the action will be the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of &s;ome motive. But has a man done what is wrong and &s;hameful? In&s;tantly the feeling varies. We accu&s;e, and we condemn him, for acting the wrong and &s;hameful part. We conceive that he had a power of acting otherways, and <HI>ought</HI> to have acted otherways. The whole train of our feeling, in a moment, accommodate them&s;elves to

the &s;uppo&s;ition of his being entirely a free agent.</P>
<P>THESE are phaenomena in human na|ture, of a very &s;ingular kind: feelings, which on both &s;ides are natural, and yet cla&s;h with each other: every event admitted to have a nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e; and yet many events &s;up|po&s;ed contingent: every action admitted ne|ce&s;&s;arily to flow from a determining motive; and yet the &s;ame action, in an after view, con&s;idered and judged of as free. Our feel|ings are no doubt the te&s;t of truth; which is &s;o evident, that, in many in&s;tances, no other means are afforded us for coming at the truth. The few exceptions that are di&s;co|vered by rea&s;on or experience, &s;erve the more to confirm the general rule. But the feelings we have now laid open can be no te&s;t of truth; becau&s;e, in contradictory pro|po&s;itions, truth cannot ly on both &s;ides. There is no other way to get out of this la|byrinth of doubts and difficulties, than to enter upon a &s;trict &s;urvey both of the natu|ral
<PB N="162" REF="167">
and moral world, which may po&s;&s;ibly lead to a di&s;covery of what is really the truth of the matter. Let us then proceed, with impartiality and attention, to inquire what we are to believe, concerning contin|gency in events, and liberty or nece&s;&s;ity in human actions: whether our feelings can be reconciled to each other, and reconciled to truth; or whether there be not here &s;ome of tho&s;e deceitful feelings, which we have al|ready hinted in &s;ome other in&s;tances to be|long to our nature.</P>
<P>TAKING a view of the natural world, we find all things there proceeding in a fixed and &s;ettled train of cau&s;es and effects. It is a point which admits of no di&s;pute, that all the changes produced in matter, and all the different modifications it a&s;&s;umes, are the re|&s;ult of fixed laws. Every effect is &s;o pre|ci&s;ely determined, that no other effect could, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, have po&s;&s;ibly re&s;ult|ed from the operation of the cau&s;e: which holds even in the minute&s;t changes of the
<PB N="163" REF="168">
different elements, as all philo&s;ophers ad|mit. Ca&s;ual and fluctuating as the&s;e &s;eem, their &s;malle&s;t variation is a nece&s;&s;ary effect of pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed laws. There is a chain of cau&s;es and effects which hang one upon an|other, running thro' this whole &s;y&s;tem; and not the &s;malle&s;t link of the chain can be broken, without altering the whole con|&s;titution of things, or &s;u&s;pending the regu|lar operation of the laws of nature. Here then, in the material world, there is nothing that can be called <HI>contingent;</HI> nothing that is left loo&s;e; but every thing mu&s;t be preci&s;e|ly what it is, and be found in that &s;tate in which we find it.</P>
<P>IN the moral world, this does not appear &s;o clearly. Man is the actor here. He is endowed with will, and he acts from choice. He has a power of beginning motion, which is &s;ubject to no mechanical laws; and there|fore he is not under what is called phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity. He has appetites and pa&s;&s;ions which prompt him to their re&s;pective gratifi|cations:
<PB N="164" REF="169">
but he is under no nece&s;&s;ity of blind ly &s;ubmitting to their impul&s;e. For rea&s;on has a power of re&s;traint. It &s;ugge&s;ts motives from the cool views of good and evil. He de|liberates upon the&s;e. In con&s;equence of his deliberation he chu&s;es: and here, if any|where, lyes our liberty. Let us examine to what this liberty amounts. That motives have &s;ome influence in determining the mind, is certain; and that they have this influence in different degrees, is equally certain. The &s;en&s;e of honour and gratitude, for in|&s;tance, are powerful motives to &s;erve a friend. Let the man's private intere&s;t con|cur; and the motives become more power|ful. Add the certain pro&s;pect of poverty, &s;hame, or bodily &s;uffering, if he &s;hall act a different part; and you leave him no choice: the motives to action are rendered irre&s;i&s;t|ible. Motives being once allowed to have a determining force in any degree, it is ea|&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e the force &s;o augmented, by ac|cumulation of motives, as to leave little free|dom to the mind, or rather none at all. In
<PB N="165" REF="170">
&s;uch in&s;tances, there is no denying that we are under a nece&s;&s;ity to act. And tho' this, to be &s;ure, is not phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity, as ari&s;|ing not from the laws of matter, but from the con&s;titution of the mind; yet the con|&s;equence is equally certain, fixed and una|voidable, in the ca&s;e of moral, as of phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity. This is &s;o true, that, in &s;ome in|&s;tances, the&s;e two kinds of nece&s;&s;ity &s;eem to coincide, &s;o as &s;carcely to be di&s;tingui&s;hed. A criminal walks to the &s;caffold in the mid&s;t of his guards. No man will deny that he is under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity in this ca&s;e. Why? becau&s;e he knows, that if he refu&s;es to go, they will drag him. I ask, Is this a phy&s;ical, or a moral nece&s;&s;ity? The an&s;wer, at fir&s;t view, is not obvious; for the di&s;|tinction betwixt the&s;e two &s;eems lo&s;t. And yet, &s;trictly &s;peaking, it is only a moral ne|ce&s;&s;ity: for it is the force of a motive which determines the criminal to walk to the &s;caf|fold; to wit, that re&s;i&s;tance is vain, becau&s;e the guards are neither to be forced nor corrupted. The idea of nece&s;&s;ity, howe|ver,
<PB N="166" REF="171">
in the minds of the &s;pectators, when they view the criminal in this &s;ituation, is not le&s;s &s;trong, than if they &s;aw him bound and carried on a &s;ledge. Nothing is more common, than to talk of an action which one mu&s;t do, and cannot avoid. He was compelled to it, we &s;ay; and it was impo&s;|&s;ible he could act otherways: when, at the &s;ame time, all the compul&s;ion we mean, is only the application of &s;ome very &s;trong mo|tive to the mind. This &s;hows, that, in the judgment and feeling of all mankind, a mo|tive may, in certain circum&s;tances, carry in it the power of rendering an action nece&s;&s;a|ry. In other words, we expect &s;uch an ac|tion in con&s;equence of &s;uch a motive, with equal confidence, as when we expect to &s;ee a &s;tone fall to the ground when it is dropt from the hand.</P>
<P>THIS, it will be &s;aid, may hold in &s;ome in|&s;tances, but not in all. For, in the greater part of human actions, there is a real feeling of liberty. When the mind he&s;itates betwixt
<PB N="167" REF="172">
two things, examines and compares, and at la&s;t comes to a re&s;olution, is there any compul&s;i|on or nece&s;&s;ity here? No compul&s;ion, it is granted; but as to nece&s;&s;ity, let us pau&s;e and examine more accurately. The re&s;olu|tion being taken, the choice being made, upon what is it founded? Certainly upon &s;ome motive, however &s;ilent or weak: for no mortal ever came to a determination, with|out the influence of &s;ome motive or other. If this be an undoubted fact, it follows of con&s;equence, that the determination mu&s;t re&s;ult, from that motive, which has the great|e&s;t influence for the time; or from what ap|pears the be&s;t and mo&s;t eligible upon the whole. If motives be of very different kinds, with regard to &s;trength and influence, which we feel to be the ca&s;e; it is involved in the very idea of the &s;tronge&s;t motive, that it mu&s;t have the &s;tronge&s;t effect in determin|ing the mind. This can no more be doubt|ed of, than that, in a balance, the greater weight mu&s;t turn the &s;cale.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="173">
HERE perhaps we &s;hall be interrupted. Men are not always rational in their determinati|ons: they often act from whim, pa&s;&s;ion, humour, things as loo&s;e and variable as the wind. This is admitted. But, &s;uppo&s;e the motive which determines the mind, to be as whim&s;ical and unrea&s;onable as you plea&s;e, its influence, however, is equally nece&s;&s;ary with that of the mo&s;t rational motive. An indolent man, for in&s;tance, is incited to ac|tion, by the &s;tronge&s;t con&s;iderations, which rea&s;on, virtue, intere&s;t, can &s;ugge&s;t. He wa|vers and he&s;itates; at la&s;t re&s;i&s;ts them all, and folds his arms. What is the cau&s;e of this? Is it that he is le&s;s under the power of motives than another man? By no means. The love of re&s;t is his motive, his prevail|ing pa&s;&s;ion: and this is as effectual to fix him in his place, as the love of glory or riches are, to render active, the vain or the covetous. In &s;hort, if motives are not under our pow|er or direction, which is confe&s;&s;edly the fact, we can, at bottom, have no liberty. We are &s;o con&s;tituted, that we cannot exert a &s;ingle
<PB N="169" REF="174">
action, but with &s;ome view, aim or purpo&s;e. At the &s;ame time, when two oppo&s;ite mo|tives pre&s;ent them&s;elves, we have not the power of an arbitrary choice. We are di|rected, by a nece&s;&s;ary determination of our nature, to prefer the &s;tronge&s;t motive.</P>
<P>IT is true, that, in di&s;puting upon this &s;ubject of human liberty, a man may attempt to &s;how, that motives have no nece&s;&s;ary in|fluence, by eating perhaps the wor&s;t apple that is before him, or, in &s;ome &s;uch trifling in&s;tance, preferring an obviou&s;ly le&s;&s;er good to a greater. But is it not plain, that the humour of &s;howing that he can act again&s;t motives, is, in this ca&s;e, the very motive of the whim&s;ical preference?</P>
<P>A COMPARISON in&s;tituted betwixt mo|ral and phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity may po&s;&s;ibly throw additional light upon this &s;ubject. Where the motives to any action are perfectly full, cogent and clear, the feeling of liberty, as we &s;howed before, entirely vani&s;hes. In
<PB N="170" REF="175">
other ca&s;es, where the field of choice is wider, and where oppo&s;ite motives counter|balance and work again&s;t each other, the mind fluctuates for a while, and feels it&s;elf more loo&s;e: but, in the end, mu&s;t as nece&s;|&s;arily be determined to the &s;ide of the mo&s;t powerful motive, as the balance, after &s;eve|ral vibrations; mu&s;t incline to the &s;ide of the preponderating weight. The laws of mind, and the laws of matter, are in this re&s;pect per|fectly &s;imilar; tho', in making the compari&s;on, we are apt to deceive our&s;elves. In form|ing a notion of phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity, we &s;eldom think of any force, but what has vi&s;ibly a full effect. A man in pri&s;on, or tied to a po&s;t, mu&s;t remain there. If he is dragged along, he cannot re&s;i&s;t. Whereas motives, which, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, are very different, do not always produce &s;en|&s;ible effects. Yet, when the compari&s;on is accurately in&s;tituted, the very &s;ame thing holds in the actions of matter. A weak mo|tive makes &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion: but, in oppo&s;i|tion to one more powerful, it has no effect
<PB N="171" REF="176">
to determine the mind. In the preci&s;e &s;ame manner, a &s;mall force will not overcome a great re&s;i&s;tance; nor the weight of an ounce in one &s;cale, counter-balance a pound in the other. Comparing together the actions of mind and matter, &s;imilar cau&s;es will, in both equally, produce &s;imilar effects.</P>
<P>BUT admitting all that has been contend|ed for, of the nece&s;&s;ary influence of mo|tives, to bring on the choice or la&s;t judg|ment of the under&s;tanding, it is urged by Dr. <HI>Clark,</HI> that man is &s;till a free agent, be|cau&s;e he has a power of acting, or beginning motion according to his will. In this, he places human liberty, that motives are not phy&s;ical efficient cau&s;es of motion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. demon&s;tration of the being and attributes, p. 565. fol. edit. and his an&s;wer to Colin's pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>. We agree with the doctor, that the immediate efficient cau&s;e of motion is not the motive, but the will to act. No per&s;on ever held, that the plea&s;ure of a &s;ummer-evening, when a man goes abroad into the fields, is
<PB N="172" REF="177">
the immediate cau&s;e of the motion of his feet. But what does this ob&s;ervation avail, when the prevailing motive, the will to act, and the action it&s;elf, are three things in&s;epa|rably linked together? The motive, accord|ing to his own conce&s;&s;ion, nece&s;&s;arily deter|mines the will; and the will nece&s;&s;arily pro|duces the action, unle&s;s it be ob&s;tructed by &s;ome foreign force. Is not the action, by con&s;equence, as nece&s;&s;ary, as the will to act; tho the motive be the immediate cau&s;e of the will only, and not of the action or be|ginning of motion? What does this author gain, by &s;howing, that we have a power of beginning motion, if that power never is, never can be, exerted, unle&s;s in con&s;equence of &s;ome volition or choice, which is nece&s;&s;a|rily cau&s;ed? But, &s;ays he, it is only a moral nece&s;&s;ity which is produced by motives; and a moral nece&s;&s;ity, he adds, is no nece&s;&s;ity at all, but is con&s;i&s;tent with the highe&s;t liberty. If the&s;e words have any meaning, the di&s;pute is at an end. For moral nece&s;&s;ity, being that &s;ort of nece&s;&s;ity which affects the mind,
<PB N="173" REF="178">
and phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity that which affects matter, it is plain, that, in all rea&s;onings concerning human liberty, moral nece&s;&s;ity, and no other, is meant to be e&s;tabli&s;hed. The laws of action, we &s;ay, which re&s;pect the human mind, are as fixed as tho&s;e which re&s;pect matter. The different nature of the&s;e laws, occa&s;ions the fixed con&s;equences of the one to be called moral, and of the other to be called phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity. But the idea of <HI>nece&s;&s;ary, certain, unavoidable,</HI> equally agrees to both. And to &s;ay that moral nece&s;&s;ity is no nece&s;&s;ity at all, becau&s;e it is not phy&s;i|cal nece&s;&s;ity, which is all that the doctor's argument amounts to, is no better, than to argue, that phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity is no nece&s;&s;ity at all, becau&s;e it is not moral nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>ONE great &s;ource of confu&s;ion, in reflect|ing upon this &s;ubject, &s;eems to be, our not di&s;tingui&s;hing betwixt nece&s;&s;ity and con|&s;traint. In common language, the&s;e are u&s;ed as equivalent terms; but they ought to be di&s;tingui&s;hed when we treat of this &s;ubject. A per&s;on, having a &s;trong de&s;ire to e&s;cape,
<PB N="174" REF="179">
remains in pri&s;on, becau&s;e the doors are guarded. Finding his keepers gone, he makes his e&s;cape. His e&s;cape now is as ne|ce&s;&s;ary, <HI>i. e.</HI> as certain and infallible a con|&s;equence of the circum&s;tances he finds him|&s;elf in, as his confinement was before; tho', in the one ca&s;e there is con&s;traint, in the other none. In this lyes the liberty of our actions, in being free from con&s;traint, and in acting according to our inclination and choice. But as this inclination and choice is unavoidably cau&s;ed or occa&s;ioned by the prevailing motive; in this lyes the nece&s;&s;i|ty of our actions, that, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, it was impo&s;&s;ible we could act otherways. In this &s;en&s;e all our actions are equally ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE preceeding rea&s;onings may perhaps make a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion, by being reduc|ed into a &s;hort argument, after this manner. No man can be conceived to act without &s;ome principle leading him to action. All our principles of action re&s;olve into <HI>de&s;ires</HI> and <HI>aver&s;ions;</HI> for nothing can prompt us to
<PB N="175" REF="180">
move or exert our&s;elves in any &s;hape, but what pre&s;ents &s;ome object to be either pur|&s;ued or avoided. A motive is an object &s;o operating upon the mind, as to produce ei|ther de&s;ire or aver&s;ion. Now, liberty as op|po&s;ed to moral nece&s;&s;ity, mu&s;t &s;ignify a pow|er in the mind, of acting without or again&s;t motives; that is to &s;ay, a power of acting without any view, purpo&s;e or de&s;ign, and even of acting in contradiction to our own de&s;ires and aver&s;ions, or to all our principles of action; which power, be&s;ides that no man was ever con&s;cious of it, &s;eems to be an ab|&s;urdity altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with a rati|onal nature.</P>
<P>WITH regard to things &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o equal as to found no preference of one to another, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to enter into any intricate inquiry, how the mind in &s;uch ca&s;es is di|rected. Tho' it &s;hould be admitted, that where there is no &s;ort of motive to influ|ence the mind, it may exert a power of act|ing arbitrarily, this would not affect the pre|ceeding
<PB N="176" REF="181">
rea&s;onings, in which, the exi&s;tence of a motive being once &s;uppo&s;ed, we have &s;hown the mind to be nece&s;&s;arily determined. Ob|jects, &s;o balanced one again&s;t another with perfect equality, if &s;uch in&s;tances are to be found, mu&s;t be &s;o few, and in matters &s;o trivial (as in the common in&s;tance of eggs) that they can have very incon&s;iderable influ|ence upon human life. It may well admit of a doubt, whether the mind be, in any ca&s;e, left altogether de&s;titute of a motive to determine its choice betwixt two objects. For, tho' the objects &s;hould be them&s;elves perfectly e|qual, yet various circum&s;tances ari&s;ing from minute unob&s;erved &s;pecialitics, of fancy, cu&s;|tom, proximity of place, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may turn the &s;cale in favours of one of the objects, to make it the motive of election. The un|ea&s;ine&s;s one is con&s;cious of, when in this &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, betwixt two things equally balanced, &s;earching and ca&s;ting about for &s;ome ground of choice; this unea&s;ine&s;s, I &s;ay, &s;ufficiently &s;hows, that to act altogether
<PB N="177" REF="182">
arbitrary is unnatural, and that our con&s;ti|tution fits us to be determined by motives.</P>
<P>BUT now a thought comes acro&s;s the mind, which demands attention. How hard is the lot of the human &s;pecies, to be thus tied down and fixed to motives; &s;ubjected by a nece&s;&s;ary law to the choice of evil, if evil happen to be the prevailing motive, or if it mi&s;lead us under the form of our greate&s;t in|tere&s;t or good! How happy to have had a free independent power of acting contrary to motives, when the prevailing motive has a bad tendency! By this power, we might have pu&s;hed our way to virtue and happi|ne&s;s, whatever motives were &s;ugge&s;ted by vice and folly to draw us back; or we might, by arbitrary will, have refrained from act|ing the bad part, tho' all the power of mo|tives concurred to urge us on. So far well; but let us &s;ee whither this will carry us. This arbitrary power being once &s;uppo&s;ed, may it not be exerted again&s;t good motives as well as bad ones? If it does us good by
<PB N="178" REF="183">
accident, in re&s;training us from vice, may it not do us ill by accident, in re&s;training us from virtue? and &s;o &s;hall we not be thrown loo&s;e altogether? At this rate, no man could be depended upon. Promi&s;es, oaths, vows, would be in vain; for nothing can ever bind or fix a man who is influenced by no mo|tive. The di&s;tinction of characters would be at an end; for a per&s;on cannot have a cha|racter, who has no fixed or uniform princi|ples of action. Nay, moral virtue it&s;elf, and all the force of law, rule and obligation, would, upon this hypothe&s;is, be nothing. For no creature can be the &s;ubject of ra|tional or moral government, who&s;e actions, by the con&s;titution of its nature, are inde|pendent of motives; and who&s;e will is ca|pricious and arbitrary. To exhort, to in|&s;truct, to promi&s;e, or to threaten, would be to no purpo&s;e. In &s;hort, &s;uch a creature, if &s;uch could exi&s;t, would be a mo&s;t bi|zarre and unaccountable being: a mere ab&s;urdity in nature, who&s;e exi&s;tence could &s;erve no end. Were we &s;o con&s;tituted, as
<PB N="179" REF="184">
always to be determined by the moral &s;en&s;e, even again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t counter-motives, this would be con&s;i&s;tent with human nature, becau&s;e it would pre&s;erve entire the con|nection, that, by an unalterable law, is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed betwixt the will and the prevailing motive. But, to break this connection alto|gether, to introduce an unbounded arbitrary liberty, in oppo&s;ition to which, motives &s;hould not have influence, would be, in&s;tead of amending, to deform and unhinge the whole human con&s;titution. No rea&s;on have we therefore to regret, that we find the will nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubjected to motives. The truth of this general po&s;ition mu&s;t coincide with our wi&s;h, unle&s;s we would rather have man to be, a whim&s;ical and ridiculous, than a rational and moral being.</P>
<P>THUS far then we have advanced in our argument, that all human actions proceed in a fixed and nece&s;&s;ary train. Man being what he is, a creature endowed with a cer|tain degree of under&s;tanding, certain pa&s;&s;i|ons
<PB N="180" REF="185">
and principles, and placed in certain circum&s;tances, it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould will or chu&s;e otherways, than in fact he wills or chu&s;es. His mind is pa&s;&s;ive in receiving im|pre&s;&s;ions of things as good or ill: accord|ing to the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, the la&s;t judgment of the under&s;tanding is nece&s;&s;arily formed; which the will, if con&s;idered as different from the la&s;t judgment of the under&s;tand|ing, nece&s;&s;arily obeys, as is fully &s;hown; and the external action is nece&s;&s;arily connect|ed with the will, or the mind's final deter|mination to act.</P>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of this rea&s;oning, we have ab&s;tracted from all controver&s;ies about Di|vine Pre&s;cience and Decree. Tho' in fact, from what has been proved, it appears, that the Divine Being decrees all future events. For he who gave &s;uch a nature to his crea|tures, and placed them in &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces, that a certain train of actions behov|ed nece&s;&s;arily to follow; he, I &s;ay, who did &s;o, and who mu&s;t have fore&s;een the con&s;e|quences,
<PB N="181" REF="186">
did certainly re&s;olve or decree that events &s;hould fall out, and men &s;hould act as they do. Pre&s;cience indeed is not, pro|perly &s;peaking, any cau&s;e of events. For events do not happen, becau&s;e they are fore|&s;een; but becau&s;e they are certainly to hap|pen, therefore they are capable of being fore|&s;een. Tho' pre&s;cience does not cau&s;e, yet it undoubtedly &s;uppo&s;es, the certain futuriti|on (as &s;choolmen &s;peak) of events. And, were there not cau&s;es which render the ex|i&s;tence of future events certain, it would in|volve a contradiction to maintain, that fu|ture events could be certainly fore&s;een. But I avoid carrying the reader any further in|to &s;uch thorny di&s;putes.</P>
<P>THE &s;um of what we have di&s;covered concerning contingency in events, and liber|ty in actions is this. Comparing together the moral and the natural world, every thing is as much the re&s;ult of e&s;tabli&s;hed laws in the one as in the other. There is nothing in the whole univer&s;e that can properly be
<PB N="182" REF="187">
called contingent, that may be, or may not be; nothing loo&s;e and fluctuating in any part of nature; but every motion in the na|tural, and every determination and action in the moral world, are directed by immutable laws: &s;o that, whil&s;t the&s;e laws remain in their force, not the &s;malle&s;t link of the uni|ver&s;al chain of cau&s;es and effects can be broken, nor any one thing be otherways than it is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As to an objection of making God the author of &s;in, which may &s;eem to ari&s;e from our &s;y&s;tem, it is rather popu|lar than philo&s;ophical. Sin, or moral turpitude, lyes in the evil intention of him who commits it: it con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ome wrong or depraved affection &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the &s;inner. Now the intention of the Deity is unerringly good. The end propo&s;ed by him is order and general happine&s;s: and there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, that all events are &s;o directed by him, as to work towards this end. In the pre|&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of things, &s;ome moral di&s;orders are indeed in|cluded. No doubt, it is a con&s;iderable difficulty, how evil comes to be in the world, if God is perfectly good. But this difficulty is not peculiar to our doctrine; but recurs up|on us at la&s;t with equal force, whatever hypothe&s;is we em|brace. For moral evil cannot exi&s;t, without being, at lea&s;t, permitted by the Deity. And, with regard to a fir&s;t cau&s;e, PERMITTING is the &s;ame thing with CAUSING; &s;ince, a|gain&s;t his will nothing can po&s;&s;ibly happen. All the &s;chemes that have been contrived for an&s;wering this objection, are but the tortoi&s;e introduced to &s;upport the elephant. They put the difficulty a &s;tep further off, but never remove it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="188">
THE doctrine of univer&s;al nece&s;&s;ity being thus laid fairly open, and proved to be the true &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e; we return to take a more deliberate view of the feelings of contingency and liberty, than was nece&s;|&s;ary in broaching the &s;ubject. And, as we mu&s;t now admit, perhaps reluctantly, that the&s;e feelings are in reality of the delu&s;ive kind, our next and only remaining theme will be to unravel, if po&s;&s;ible, this curious my&s;tery, by trying to reach the purpo&s;e of endowing man with feelings, &s;o contra|dictory to the truth of things.</P>
<P>AND to begin with a review of the feel|ing of contingency. It is certain, that, in our ordinary train of thinking, things never oc|cur to us in the light above &s;et forth. A multitude of events appear to us as depend|ing upon our&s;elves to cau&s;e or to prevent: and we readily make a di&s;tinction betwixt events, which are nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>i. e.</HI> which mu&s;t be, and events which are contingent, <HI>i. e.</HI> which may
<PB N="184" REF="189">
be, or may not be. This di&s;tinction is with|out foundation in truth: for all things that fall out, either in the natural or moral world, are, as we have &s;een, alike nece&s;&s;ary, and a|like the re&s;ult of fixed laws. Yet, how much &s;oever a philo&s;opher may be convinced of this, the di&s;tinction betwixt things nece&s;&s;ary, and things contingent, remains as much with him, in the common train of his thoughts, as with any other man. We act univer&s;ally upon this &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;tinction. Nay, it is in truth the foundation of all the labour, care and indu&s;try of mankind. To illu&s;trate this by an example; con&s;tant expe|rience has taught us, that death is a nece&s;&s;a|ry event. The human frame is not made to la&s;t, as it is, for ever; and therefore no man thinks of acquiring a natural immorta|lity. But the particular time of our death appears a contingent event. However cer|tain it be, that the preci&s;e time and man|ner of each man's death, is determined by a train of preceeding cau&s;es, not le&s;s nece&s;&s;a|ry than the hour of the &s;un's ri&s;ing or &s;etting
<PB N="185" REF="190">
to-morrow, yet no per&s;on is in the lea&s;t af|fected by this doctrine. In the care of pro|longing life, every man is conducted by the feeling he has, of the contingency of the time of his death; which, to a certain term of years, he con&s;iders as depending in a great mea&s;ure upon him&s;elf, by caution again&s;t ac|cidents, due u&s;e of exerci&s;e, medicine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To the&s;e means, he applies him&s;elf with the &s;ame diligence, as if there was, in fact, no nece&s;&s;ary train of cau&s;es, to fix the period of his life. In &s;hort, whoever attends to his own practical ideas; whoever reflects upon the meaning of the&s;e words, which occur in all languages, of things <HI>po&s;&s;ible, contingent, that are in our power to cau&s;e or prevent;</HI> whoever, I &s;ay, reflects upon &s;uch words, will clearly &s;ee, that they &s;ugge&s;t certain feelings, or natural notions, repugnant to the doctrine above e&s;tabli&s;hed, of univer&s;al ne|ce&s;&s;ity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This repugnancy of feeling to truth, gave ri&s;e to the famous di&s;pute concerning things po&s;&s;ible, among the antient Stoicks, who held this doctrine of univer&s;al nece&s;&s;ity. Dio|dorus, as Cicero informs us in his book <HI>de fato,</HI> cap. vii. held this opinion, <Q>Id &s;olum fieri po&s;&s;e, quod aut verum &s;it, aut futurum &s;it verum; at quicquid futurum &s;it, id di|cit fieri nece&s;&s;e e&s;&s;e, et quicquid non &s;it futurum, id ne|gat fieri po&s;&s;e.</Q> That is, he maintained, there is no|thing contingent in future events, nothing po&s;&s;ible to hap|pen, but that preci&s;e event which will happen. This no doubt was carrying their &s;y&s;tem its due length: tho', in this way of &s;peaking, there is &s;omething that manife&s;tly &s;hocks the natural feelings of mankind. Chry&s;ippus, on the other hand, &s;en&s;ible of the har&s;hne&s;s of the above con&s;equence, maintained, that it is po&s;&s;ible for future events to happen o|therways than in fact they happen. In this, he was cer|tainly incon&s;i&s;tent with his general &s;y&s;tem of nece&s;&s;ity; and therefore, as Cicero gives us to under&s;tand, was often emba|ra&s;&s;ed in the di&s;pute with Diodorus: and Plutarch, in his book, <HI>de repugnantiis Stoicorum,</HI> expo&s;es him for this incon&s;i&s;ten|cy. But Chry&s;ippus cho&s;e to follow his natural feelings, in op|po&s;ition to philo&s;ophy; holding by this, that Diodorus's doctrine of nothing being po&s;&s;ible but what happens, was <HI>ignava ratio,</HI> tending to ab&s;olute inaction; <HI>cui &s;i pareamus,</HI> as Cicero expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>nihil omnino agamus in vita.</HI> So ear|ly were philo&s;ophers &s;en&s;ible of the difficulty of reconciling &s;peculation with feeling, as to this doctrine of fate.</NOTE>.</P>

WHAT then &s;hall be done in this ca&s;e, where truth contradicts the common feel|ings and natural notions of mankind; where it pre&s;ents to us, with irre&s;i&s;tible evidence, a &s;y&s;tem of univer&s;al nece&s;&s;ity upon which we never act; but are &s;o formed, as to conduct
<PB N="187" REF="192">
our&s;elves by a &s;y&s;tem of notions quite oppo|&s;ite? Shall we &s;acrifice ab&s;tract truth to feel|ing? or &s;hall we &s;tand by truth, and force our feelings into compliance? Neither of the&s;e will do. Truth is too rigid to bend to mere feeling; and our feelings are inca|pable of being forced by &s;peculation. The attempt is vain, <HI>pugnantia &s;ecum, frontibus adver&s;is, componere.</HI> Let us be hone&s;t then. Let us fairly own, that the truth of things is on the &s;ide of nece&s;&s;ity; but that it was nece&s;&s;ary for man to be formed, with &s;uch feelings and notions of contingency, as would fit him for the part he has to act. This thought requires illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>THE Deity is the fir&s;t cau&s;e of all things. He formed, in his infinite mind, the great plan or &s;cheme, upon which all things were to be governed; and put it in execution, by e&s;tabli&s;hing certain laws, both in the natural and moral world, which are fixed and im|mutable. By virtue of the&s;e laws, all things proceed in a regular train of cau&s;es and ef|fects,
<PB N="188" REF="193">
bringing about tho&s;e events which are comprehended in the original plan, and ad|mitting the po&s;&s;ibility of none other. This univer&s;e is a va&s;t machine, winded up and &s;et a going. The &s;everal &s;prings and wheels act unerringly one upon another. The hand advances, and the clock &s;trikes, pre|ci&s;ely as the arti&s;t has determined. Whoe|ver has ju&s;t ideas, and a true ta&s;te of philo|&s;ophy, will &s;ee this to be the real theory, of the univer&s;e; and that, upon any other the|ory, there can be no general order, no whole, no plan, no means nor end in its admini&s;tration. In this plan, man, a ratio|nal creature, was to bear his part, and to ful|fill certain ends, for which he was de&s;igned. He was to appear as an actor, and to act with con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and &s;pontaneity. He was to exerci&s;e thought and rea&s;on, and to receive the improvements of his nature, by the due u&s;e of the&s;e rational powers. Con&s;equently it was nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould have &s;ome idea of liberty; &s;ome feeling of things po&s;|&s;ible and contingent, things depending upon
<PB N="189" REF="194">
him&s;elf to cau&s;e, that he might be led to a proper exerci&s;e of that activity, for which he was de&s;igned. To have had his in&s;tinctive feelings, his practical ideas, formed upon the &s;cheme of univer&s;al nece&s;&s;ity; to have &s;een him&s;elf a part of that great machine, wind|ed up, and &s;et a going, by the author of his nature, would have been altogether incon|gruous to the ends he was to fulfill. Then, indeed, the <HI>ignava ratio,</HI> the inactive doc|trine of the Stoicks, would have followed. Conceiving nothing to be contingent, or de|pending upon him&s;elf to cau&s;e, there would have been no room for fore-thought about futurity, nor for any &s;ort of indu&s;try and care: he would have had no motives to ac|tion, but immediate &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure and pain. He mu&s;t have been formed like the brutes, who have no other principle of action, but mere in&s;tinct. The few in&s;tincts he is at pre&s;ent endowed with, would have been altogether in&s;ufficient. He mu&s;t have had an in&s;tinct to &s;ow, another to reap. He mu&s;t have had in&s;tincts to pur&s;ue every con|veniency,
<PB N="190" REF="195">
and perform every office of life. In &s;hort, rea&s;on and thought could not have been exerci&s;ed in the way they are, that is, man could not have been man, had he not been furni&s;hed with a feeling of contingen|cy. In this, as in all things el&s;e, the Di|vine Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s are mo&s;t admi|rable. As, in the natural world, the Al|mighty has adapted our &s;en&s;es, not to the di&s;covery of the intimate nature and e&s;&s;en|ces of things, but to the u&s;es and conveni|encies of life; as he has, in &s;everal in&s;tan|ces, exhibited natural objects to us, not in their real, but in a &s;ort of artificial view, clothed with &s;uch di&s;tinctions, and produc|ing &s;uch &s;en&s;ations as are for the benefit of man: &s;o he has exhibited the intellectual world to us, in a like artificial view, clothed with certain colours and di&s;tinctions, ima|ginary, but u&s;eful. Life is conducted ac|cording to this artificial view of things, and, by our &s;peculations, is not in the lea&s;t affect|ed. Let the philo&s;opher meditate in his clo&s;et upon ab&s;tract truth; let him be ever
<PB N="191" REF="196">
&s;o much convinced of the &s;ettled, nece&s;&s;ary, train of cau&s;es and effects, which leaves no|thing, properly &s;peaking, in his power; yet, the moment he comes forth into the world, he acts as a free agent. And, what is won|derful, tho' in this he acts upon a fal&s;e &s;up|po&s;ition, yet he is not thereby mi&s;led from the ends of action, but, on the contrary, ful|fills them, to the be&s;t advantage. Long ex|perience has made him &s;en&s;ible, that &s;ome things, &s;uch as the &s;un's ri&s;ing and &s;etting, depend upon immutable laws. This is contradicted by no feeling, as it is no way for his benefit, that he &s;hould act upon a|ny other &s;uppo&s;ition, Such things he rec|kons upon as nece&s;&s;ary. But there are other things, which depend upon the &s;pontancous choices of men, or upon a concurrence of natural and moral cau&s;es. As to the&s;e, he has not knowledge enough, to fore&s;ee and determine by what law they will happen: and his ignorance of the event, is made to have the &s;ame effect upon his mind, as if the event were what we vulgarly call contin|gent.
<PB N="192" REF="197">
Its <HI>uncertainty as to him</HI> produces the &s;ame feeling, and &s;tirs him up to the &s;ame activity, as if it were <HI>uncertain in it&s;elf,</HI> and had no determined cau&s;e of its futurition. This feeling then of contingency, and all the ideas connected with it, may be treated as &s;econdary qualities, which have no real exi&s;tence in things; but, like other &s;econda|ry qualities, are made to appear as exi&s;ting in events, or belonging to them, in order to &s;erve the nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es of human life.</P>
<P>Some objections &s;hall be con&s;idered, after di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the other branch of the di&s;qui&s;i|tion concerning liberty of action. The&s;e &s;ubjects are &s;o clo&s;ely connected, that they cannot fail to throw light upon each other. Contingency in events is analogous to liber|ty in actions. The one is a &s;uppo&s;ed quali|ty of the thing; the other of the actor.</P>
<P>The extent of human liberty is above a&s;|certained. It con&s;i&s;ts in &s;pontaneity, or act|ing according to our inclination and choice.
<PB N="193" REF="198">
It may be therefore di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>con|&s;traint,</HI> but mu&s;t not be oppo&s;ed to nece&s;&s;i|ty. For, as has been fully &s;hown, the mind, in the mo&s;t calm choice, the mo&s;t deliberate action, is nece&s;&s;arily, <HI>i. e.</HI> unavoidably and certainly, determined by the prepollent mo|tive. When we examine accurately, how far our feelings corre&s;pond to this &s;y&s;tem; we find, as was hinted before, fir&s;t, that, an|tecedent to any particular action, we gene|rally think and rea&s;on upon the &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ity. In con&s;idering or gue&s;&s;ing at fu|ture events, we always conclude, that a man will act con&s;i&s;tently with his character; we infer what his actions will be, from the knowledge we have of his temper, and the motives that are fitted to influence it; and never dream of any man's having a power of acting again&s;t motives. Here we have a ve|ry weak feeling, if any at all, of liberty, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from nece&s;&s;ity: and wi&s;ely &s;o ordered, that a clue, as it were, might be afforded, to guide us in the labyrinth of fu|ture actions, which, were it not for the con|nection
<PB N="194" REF="199">
betwixt an action and its motive, would appear like a rope of &s;and, loo&s;e and unconnected; and no means left of rea&s;on|ing upon, or fore&s;eeing future actions. It is to be ob&s;erved in the next place, that, dur|ing the action, the feeling begins to vary; and, unle&s;s in ca&s;es where the motive is &s;o &s;trong and overbearing, as to approach to the nature of con&s;traint; unle&s;s, in the&s;e, a man has a feeling of liberty, or of a power of acting otherways than he is doing. But, in the third place, it is principally in reflect|ing and pa&s;&s;ing judgment upon a pa&s;t action, that the feeling of liberty is &s;en&s;ible and &s;trong. Then it is, that our actions are not con&s;idered as proceeding in a nece&s;&s;ary una|voidable train: but we accu&s;e and blame o|thers, for not having acted the part they <HI>might</HI> and <HI>ought</HI> to have acted, and condemn our|&s;elves, and feel remor&s;e, for having been guil|ty of a wrong we <HI>might have</HI> refrained from. The operations of moral con&s;cience plainly proceed upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, that there is &s;uch a power in man of directing
<PB N="195" REF="200">
his actions, as rendered it po&s;&s;ible for the per&s;on accu&s;ed, to have acted a better part. This affords an argument, which the advo|cates for liberty have urged in its full force, again&s;t the doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity. They rea|&s;on thus: If actions be nece&s;&s;ary, and not in our own power, and if we know it to be &s;o, what ground can there be for reprehen|&s;ion and blame, for &s;elf-condemnation and remor&s;e? If a clock had under&s;tanding to be &s;en&s;ible of its own motions, knowing, at the &s;ame time, that they proceed according to nece&s;&s;ary laws, could it find fault with it&s;elf for &s;triking wrong? Would it not blame the arti&s;t, who had ill adju&s;ted the wheels on which its movements depended? So that, upon this &s;cheme, &s;ay they, all the moral con&s;titution of our nature is over|turned. There is an end to all the operati|ons of con&s;cience about right and wrong. Man is no longer a moral agent, nor the &s;ub|ject of prai&s;e or blame for what he does.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="201">
THIS difficulty is great, and never has been &s;urmounted by the advocates for ne|ce&s;&s;ity. They endeavour to &s;urmount it, by reconciling feeling to philo&s;ophic truth, in the following manner. We are &s;o con&s;titut|ed, they &s;ay, that certain affections, and the actions which proceed from them, appear o|dious and ba&s;e; and others agreeable and lovely; that, wherever they are beheld, ei|ther in our&s;elves or others, the moral &s;en&s;e nece&s;&s;arily approves of the one, and con|demns the other; that this approbation is immediate and in&s;tinctive, without any re|flection on the liberty or nece&s;&s;ity of acti|ons; that, on the contrary, the more any per&s;on is under the power of his affections and pa&s;&s;ions, and, by con&s;equence, the great|er nece&s;&s;ity he is under, the more virtuous or vicious he is e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>BUT this account of the matter is not &s;a|tisfactory. All that is here &s;aid, is in the main true, but is not the whole truth. I appeal to any man who has been guilty of a bad action, which gives him unea&s;ine&s;s, whe|ther
<PB N="197" REF="202">
there is not &s;omewhat more in the inward feeling, than merely a di&s;like or di&s;approbation of the affection, from which his action proceeded? whether the pain, the <HI>cruciatus</HI> of remorfe, is not founded on the notion of a power he has over his will and actions, that he might have for|born to do the ill thing? and whether it is not upon this account, that he is gall|ed within, angry at him&s;elf, and confe&s;&s;|es him&s;elf to be ju&s;tly blameable? An unea|&s;ine&s;s &s;omewhat of the &s;ame kind, is felt up|on the reflection of any fooli&s;h or ra&s;h acti|on, committed again&s;t the rules of wi&s;dom. The &s;ting is indeed much &s;harper, and for very wi&s;e rea&s;ons, when a man has tre&s;pa&s;&s;|ed again&s;t the rules of &s;trict morality. But, in both ca&s;es, the unea&s;ine&s;s proceeds upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that he was free, and had it in his power to have acted a better part. This indeed is true, that to be &s;o entirely under the power of any bad pa&s;&s;ion, (lu&s;t, for in|&s;tance, or cruelty) as to be incapable of act|ing otherways than they direct, con&s;titutes
<PB N="198" REF="203">
a very hateful character. I admit, that all &s;uch ill affections are naturally, and in them|&s;elves, the objects of di&s;like and hatred, where|ever they are beheld. But I in&s;i&s;t upon it, that mere di&s;like and hatred, are not the whole, but only a part of the moral feeling. The per&s;on, thus under the dominion of bad pa&s;&s;ions, is accu&s;ed, is condemned, &s;ingly up|on this ground, that it was <HI>thro' his own fault</HI> he became &s;o &s;ubject to them; in other words, that it was in his power, to have kept his mind free from the en&s;laving influ|ence of corrupt affections. Were not this the ca&s;e, brute animals might be the objects of moral blame, as well as man. Some bea&s;ts are reckoned &s;avage and cruel, others treacherous and fal&s;e: we di&s;like, we hate creatures &s;o ill con&s;tituted: but we do not blame nor condemn them, as we do rational agents; becau&s;e they are not &s;uppo&s;ed to have a &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, nor free|dom and power of directing their actions ac|cording to that inward rule. We mu&s;t therefore admit, that the idea of freedom,
<PB N="199" REF="204">
of a power of regulating our will and acti|ons according to certain rules, is e&s;&s;ential to the moral feeling. On the &s;y&s;tem of u|niver&s;al nece&s;&s;ity, ab&s;tracted from this feel|ing, tho' certain affections and actions might excite our approbation, and others our di&s;|like, there could be no place for blame or remor&s;e. All the ideas would entirely va|ni&s;h, which at pre&s;ent are &s;ugge&s;ted by the words <HI>ought</HI> and <HI>&s;hould,</HI> when applied to mo|ral conduct.</P>
<P>HERE then is another in&s;tance of a natu|ral feeling, oppo&s;ed to philo&s;ophic truth, a|nalogous to what is before con&s;idered. It is the more remarkable, that it has given ri&s;e to tho&s;e di&s;putes about liberty and ne|ce&s;&s;ity, which have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted thro' all ages in the inquiring world; which, &s;ince the ear|lie&s;t accounts of philo&s;ophy, have run thro' all different &s;ects of philo&s;ophers, and have been ingrafted into mo&s;t of the religious &s;y&s;|tems. We are now able, I imagine, to give a clear and &s;atisfactory account why the dif|ferent
<PB N="200" REF="205">
parties never could agree; becau&s;e, in truth, the feeling of liberty, which we have, does not agree with the real fact. Tho&s;e who were bolde&s;t in their inquiries, traced out the philo&s;ophic truth: they &s;aw that all things proceeded in a nece&s;&s;ary train of cau|&s;es and effects, which rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for them, to act otherways than they did; and to this &s;y&s;tem they adhered, without yielding to natural feelings. Tho&s;e again, who had not courage to oppo&s;e the fir&s;t and mo&s;t obvious feelings of their heart, &s;topped &s;hort, and adhered to liberty. It is ob&s;erv|able, that the &s;ide of liberty has always been the mo&s;t popular, and mo&s;t generally embraced: and, upon this &s;y&s;tem, all popu|lar di&s;cour&s;es and exhortations mu&s;t needs proceed. Even tho&s;e per&s;ons, who&s;e phi|lo&s;ophical tenets are built upon the &s;y&s;tem of nece&s;&s;ity, find them&s;elves obliged to de|&s;ert that &s;y&s;tem, in popular argument, and to adopt the &s;tile and language of tho&s;e who e&s;pou&s;e liberty. Among the antients, the great a&s;&s;ertors of nece&s;&s;ity were the Stoicks;
<PB N="201" REF="206">
a &s;evere and rigid &s;ect, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ed doc|trine it was, to &s;ubdue all our feelings to philo&s;ophy. The Platonics, Academics and Epicureans, who embraced a &s;ofter &s;cheme of philo&s;ophy, and were more men of the world than the Stoics, leaned to the &s;ide of liberty. Both parties have their own advantages in rea&s;oning; and both, when pu&s;hed, run into difficulties, from which they can never extricate them&s;elves. The advocates for liberty talk with great ad|vantage upon the moral powers of man, and his character as an accountable being: but are at a lo&s;s, how to give any view of the univer&s;e, as a regular pre-adju&s;ted plan; and when urged with the connection betwixt the motive and the action, and the nece&s;&s;a|ry train of cau&s;es and effects, which re&s;ults from admitting it to be a fixed connection, they find them&s;elves greatly embarra&s;&s;ed. Here the patrons of nece&s;&s;ity triumph. They have manife&s;tly all the advantages of &s;peculative argument; whil&s;t they fail in ac|counting for man's moral powers, and &s;truggle

in vain to reconcile to their &s;y&s;tem, the te&s;|timony which con&s;cience clearly gives to freedom.</P>
<P>LET us then fairly acknowledge, concern|ing both the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of philo&s;ophers, that they were partly in the right, and partly in the wrong. They divided, as it were, the truth betwixt them. The one had ab&s;tract rea&s;on on their &s;ide: the other had natu|ral feeling. In endeavouring to reconcile the&s;e oppo&s;ites, both parties failed; and the vain attempt has rendered the controver&s;y difficult and perplexed. After having a&s;|certained the foundation, upon which the doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity is built, and which &s;eems incapable of being &s;haken, let us fair|ly and candidly take our nature as we find it, which will lead us to this conclu&s;ion, that tho' man, in truth, is a nece&s;&s;ary agent, having all his actions determined by fixed and im|mutable laws; yet that, this being concealed from him, he acts with the conviction of be|ing a free agent. It is concealed from him,
<PB N="203" REF="208">
I &s;ay, as to the purpo&s;es of action: for whatever di&s;coveries he makes as a philo&s;o|pher, the&s;e affect not his conduct as a man. In principle and &s;peculation, let him be a mo&s;t rigid fatali&s;t; he has neverthele&s;s all the feelings which would ari&s;e from power over his own actions. He is angry at him&s;elf when he has done wrong. He prai&s;es and blames ju&s;t like other men: nor can all his principles &s;et him above the reach of &s;elf-condemnation and remor&s;e, when con&s;ci|ence at any time &s;mites him. It is true, that a man of this belief, when he is &s;eeking to make his mind ea&s;y, after &s;ome bad action, may rea&s;on upon the principles of nece&s;&s;ity, that, according to the con&s;titution of his nature, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to have acted any other part. But this will give him little re|lief. In &s;pite of all rea&s;onings, his remor&s;e will &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Nature never intended us to act upon this plan; and our natural princi|ples are too deeply rooted, to give way to phi|lo&s;ophy. This ca&s;e is preci&s;ely &s;imilar to that of contingency. A feeling of liberty,
<PB N="204" REF="209">
which I now &s;cruple not to call deceitful, is &s;o interwoven with our nature, that it has an equal effect in action, as if we were real|ly endued with &s;uch a power.</P>
<P>HAVING explained, at full length, this re|markable feeling of liberty, and examined, as we went along, &s;ome arguments again&s;t nece&s;&s;ity that are founded upon it; we now proceed to handle this feeling, as we have done that of contingency, with regard to its final cau&s;e. And in this branch of our na|ture are di&s;played the greate&s;t wi&s;dom, and the greate&s;t goodne&s;s. Man mu&s;t be &s;o con|&s;tituted, in order to attain the proper im|provement of his nature, in virtue and hap|pine&s;s. Put the ca&s;e, he were entirely di|ve&s;ted of his pre&s;ent ideas of liberty: &s;up|po&s;e him to &s;ee and conceive his own nature, and the con&s;titution of things, in the light of &s;trict philo&s;ophic truth; in the &s;ame light they are beheld by the deity: to conceive him|&s;elf, and all his actions, nece&s;&s;arily linked into the great chain of cau&s;es and effects, which
<PB N="205" REF="210">
renders the whole order both of the natural and moral world unalterably determined in every article: &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;ay, our natural feelings, our practical ideas to &s;uit and tally with this, which is the real plan; and what would follow? Why, an entire derangement of our pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of action, e&s;pecially with regard to the motives which now lead us to virtue. There would &s;till indeed be ground for the love of virtue, as the be&s;t con&s;titution of nature, and the only &s;ure foundation of happine&s;s; and, in this view, we might be grieved when we found our|&s;elves deficient in good principles. But this would be all. We could feel no inward &s;elf-approbation on doing well, no remor&s;e on doing ill; becau&s;e both the good and the ill were nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable. There would be no more place for applau&s;e or blame among mankind: none of that gene|rous indignation we now feel at the bad, as per&s;ons who have abu&s;ed and perverted their rational powers: no more notion of ac|countablene&s;s for the u&s;e of tho&s;e powers: no
<PB N="206" REF="211">
&s;en&s;e of ill de&s;ert, or ju&s;t puni&s;hment annex|ed to crimes as their due; nor of any reward merited by worthy and generous actions. All the&s;e ideas, and feelings, &s;o u&s;eful to men in their moral conduct, vani&s;h at once with the feeling of liberty. There would be field for no other pa&s;&s;ions but love and hatred, &s;orrow and pity: and the &s;en&s;e of <HI>duty,</HI> of being <HI>obliged</HI> to certain things which we <HI>ought</HI> to perform, mu&s;t be quite extingui&s;h|ed; for we can have no conception of mo|ral <HI>obligation,</HI> without &s;uppo&s;ing a power in the agent over his own actions.</P>
<P>IT appears then mo&s;t fit and wi&s;e, that we &s;hould be endued with a &s;en&s;e of liberty; without which, man mu&s;t have been ill qua|lified for acting his pre&s;ent part. That ar|tificial light, in which the feeling of liberty pre&s;ents the moral world to our view, an|&s;wers all the good purpo&s;es of making the actions of man entirely dependent upon him|&s;elf. His happine&s;s and mi&s;ery appear to be in his own power. He appears prai&s;e|worthy
<PB N="207" REF="212">
or culpable, according as he im|proves or neglects his rational faculties. The idea of his being an accountable crea|rure ari&s;es. Reward &s;eems due to merit; puni&s;hment to crimes. He feels the force of moral obligation. In &s;hort, new pa&s;&s;ions ari&s;e, and a variety of new &s;prings are &s;et in motion, to make way for new exertions of rea&s;on and activity. In all which, tho' man is really actuated by laws of nece&s;&s;ary influ|ence, yet he &s;eems to move him&s;elf: and whil&s;t the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem is gradually carri|ed on to perfection by the fir&s;t mover, that powerful hand, which winds up and directs the great machine, is never brought into &s;ight.</P>
<P>IT will now be proper to an&s;wer &s;ome ob|jections, which may be urged again&s;t the doctrine we have advanced. One, which at fir&s;t, may &s;eem of con&s;iderable weight, is, that we found virtue altogether upon a deceitful feeling of liberty, which, it may be alledged, is neither a &s;ecure nor an honourable foun|dation.
<PB N="208" REF="213">
But, in the fir&s;t place, I deny that we have founded it altogether upon a deceitful feeling. For, independent of the deceitful feeling of liberty, there is in the nature of man a firm foundation for virtue. He mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that virtue is e&s;&s;entially prefer|able to vice; that it is the ju&s;t order, the perfection and happine&s;s of his nature. For, &s;uppo&s;ing him only endued with the prin|ciple of &s;elf-love; this principle will lead him to di&s;tingui&s;h moral good from evil, &s;o far as to give ground for loving the one, and hating the other: as he mu&s;t needs &s;ee that benevolence, ju&s;tice, temperance, and the other virtues, are the nece&s;&s;ary means of his happine&s;s, and that all vice and wic|kedne&s;s introduce di&s;order and mi&s;ery. But man is endued with a &s;ocial as well as a &s;elf|i&s;h principle, and has an immediate &s;atisfac|tion and plea&s;ure in the happine&s;s of others, which is a further ground for di&s;tingui&s;hing and loving virtue. All this, I &s;ay, takes place, laying a&s;ide the deceitful feeling of liberty, and &s;uppo&s;ing all our notions to be
<PB N="209" REF="214">
adju&s;ted to the &s;y&s;tem of nece&s;&s;ity. I add, that there is nothing in the above doctrine, to exclude the perception, of a certain beauty and excellency in virtue, according to lord <HI>Shaftesbury</HI> and the antient Philo&s;ophers; which may, for ought we know, render it lovely and admirable to all rational beings. It appears to us, unque&s;tionably, under the form of intrin&s;ick excellency, even when we think not of its tendency to our happi|ne&s;s. Ideas of moral obligation, of remor&s;e, of merit, and all that is connected with this way of thinking, ari&s;e from, what may be called, a wi&s;e delu&s;ion in our nature concern|ing liberty: but, as this affects only a certain modification of our ideas of virtue and vice, there is nothing in it, to render the foundati|on of virtue, either un&s;ecure or di&s;honourable. Un&s;ecure it does not render it, becau&s;e, as now ob&s;erved, virtue partly &s;tands firm up|on a &s;eparate foundation, independent of the&s;e feelings; and even where built upon the&s;e feelings, it is &s;till built upon human nature. For though the&s;e feelings of li|berty
<PB N="210" REF="215">
vary from the truth of things, they are, neverthele&s;s, e&s;&s;ential to the nature of man. We act upon them, and cannot act otherways. And therefore, tho' the di&s;|tinction betwixt virtue and vice, had no other foundation but the&s;e feelings, (which is not the ca&s;e) it would &s;till have an immoveable and &s;ecure foundation in human nature. As for the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;honour done to virtue, by re&s;ting its authority, in any degree, on a de|ceitful feeling, there is &s;o little ground for this part of the objection, that, on the con|trary, our doctrine mo&s;t highly exalts vir|tue. For the above de&s;cribed artificial &s;en&s;e of liberty, is wholly contrived to &s;upport virtue, and to give its dictates the force of a law. Hereby it is di&s;covered to be, in a &s;in|gular manner, the care of the Deity; and a peculiar &s;ort of glory is thrown around it. The Author of nature, has not re&s;ted it, up|on the ordinary feelings and principles of human nature, as he has re&s;ted our other affections and appetites, even tho&s;e which are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to our exi&s;tence. But a
<PB N="211" REF="216">
&s;ort of extraordinary machinery is introduc|ed for its &s;ake. Human nature is forced, as it were, out of its cour&s;e, and made to re|ceive a nice and artificial &s;et of feelings; merely that con&s;cience may have a com|manding power, and virtue be &s;et as on a throne. This could not otherways be brought about, but by means of the deceit|ful feeling of liberty, which therefore is a greater honour to virtue, a higher recom|mendation of it, than if our conceptions were, in every particular, corre&s;pondent to the truth of things.</P>
<P>A SECOND objection which may be urg|ed again&s;t our &s;y&s;tem, is, that it &s;eems to re|pre&s;ent the Deity, as acting deceitfully by his creatures. He has given them certain ideas of contingency in events, and of liberty in their own actions, by which he has, in a manner, forced them to act upon a fal&s;e hy|pothe&s;is; as if he were unable, to carry on the government of this world, did his crea|tures conceive things, according to the real
<PB N="212" REF="217">
truth. This objection is, in a great mea&s;ure, obviated, by what we ob&s;erved in the intro|duction to this e&s;&s;ay, concerning our &s;en&s;ible ideas. It is univer&s;ally allowed by modern philo&s;ophers, that the perceptions of our ex|ternal &s;en&s;es, are not always agreeable to &s;trict truth, but &s;o contrived, as rather to an|&s;wer the purpo&s;es of u&s;e. Now, if it be called a deceit in our &s;en&s;es, not to give us ju&s;t repre&s;entations of the material world, the Deity mu&s;t be the author of this deceit, as much as he is, of that which prevails in our moral ideas. But no ju&s;t objection can ly again&s;t the conduct of the Deity, in either ea&s;e. Our &s;en&s;es, both internal and exter|nal, are given us for different ends and pur|po&s;es; &s;ome to di&s;cover truth, others to make us happy and virtuous. The &s;en&s;es which are appropriated to the di&s;covery of truth, unerringly an&s;wer their end. So do the &s;en&s;es, which are appropriated to virtue and happine&s;s. And, in this view, it is no ma|terial objection, that the &s;ame &s;en&s;e does not an&s;wer both ends. As to the other part of
<PB N="213" REF="218">
the objection, that it mu&s;t imply imperfecti|on in the Deity, if he cannot e&s;tabli&s;h virtue but upon a delu&s;ive foundation; we may be &s;atisfied how fallacious this rea&s;oning is, by reflecting upon the numberle&s;s appearances, of moral evil and di&s;order in this world. From the&s;e appearances, much more &s;trong|ly, were there any force in this rea&s;oning, might we infer imperfection in the Deity; &s;eeing the &s;tate of this world, in many par|ticulars, does not an&s;wer the notions we are apt to form, of &s;upreme power conducted by perfect wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. But, in truth, there is nothing in our doctrine, which can ju&s;tly argue imperfection in the Deity. For it is abundantly plain, fir&s;t, that it is a more perfect &s;tate of things, and more worthy of the Deity, to have all events going on with unbroken order, in a fixed train of cau&s;es and effects; than to have every thing de&s;ultory and contingent. And, if &s;uch a being as man, was to be placed in this world, to act his pre&s;ent part; it was nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould have a notion of contingency in e|vents,
<PB N="214" REF="219">
and of liberty in his own actions. The objection therefore, on the whole, amounts to no more, than that the Deity cannot work contradictions. For, if it was fit and wi&s;e, that man &s;hould think and act, as a free agent, it was impo&s;&s;ible this could be otherways accompli&s;hed, than by endowing him with a &s;en&s;e of liberty: and if it was al&s;o fit and wi&s;e, that univer&s;al nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould be the real plan of the univer&s;e, this &s;en&s;e of liber|ty could be no other than a deceitful one.</P>
<P>ANOTHER objection may perhaps be rai&s;|ed again&s;t us in this form. If it was nece&s;&s;a|ry for man to be con&s;tituted, with &s;uch an artificial feeling, why was he endowed with &s;o much knowledge, as to unravel the my&s;|tery? What purpo&s;e does it &s;erve, to let in ju&s;t &s;o much light, as to di&s;cover the di&s;gui&s;|ed appearance of the moral world, when it was intended, that his conduct &s;hould be ad|ju&s;ted to this di&s;gui&s;ed appearance? To this, I an&s;wer, fir&s;t, that the di&s;covery, when made, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be of any bad con&s;equence;
<PB N="215" REF="220">
and next, that a good con&s;equence, of very great importance, re&s;ults from it. No bad con&s;equence, I &s;ay, en&s;ues from the di&s;cove|ry, that liberty and contingency are deceit|ful feelings; for the ca&s;e is confe&s;&s;edly pa|rallel in the natural world, where no harm has en&s;ued. After we have di&s;covered, by philo&s;ophy, that &s;everal of the appearances of nature, are only u&s;eful illu&s;ions, that &s;econda|ry qualities exi&s;t not in matter, and that our &s;en&s;ible ideas, in various in&s;tances, do not corre&s;pond to philo&s;ophic truth; after the&s;e di&s;coveries are made, do they, in the lea&s;t, affect even the philo&s;opher him&s;elf in ordi|nary action? Does not he, in common with the re&s;t of mankind, proceed, as it is fit he &s;hould, upon the common &s;y&s;tem of ap|pearances and natural feelings? As little, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, do our &s;peculations about liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, counteract the plan of nature. Upon the &s;y&s;tem of liberty we do, and mu&s;t act: and no di&s;coveries, made con|cerning the illu&s;ive nature of that feeling, are
<PB N="216" REF="221">
capable of di&s;appointing, in any degree, the intention of the Deity.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all. The&s;e di&s;coveries are al&s;o of excellent u&s;e, as they furni&s;h us with one of the &s;tronge&s;t arguments, for the exi&s;tence of the Deity, and as they &s;et the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of his providence, in the mo&s;t &s;triking light. Nothing carries in it more expre&s;s characters of de&s;ign; nothing can be conceived more oppo&s;ite to chance, than a plan &s;o artfully contrived, for adju&s;t|ing our impre&s;&s;ions and feelings to the pur|po&s;es of life. For here things are carried off, as it were, from the &s;traight line; taken out of the cour&s;e, in which they would of them|&s;elves proceed; and &s;o moulded, as forcibly, and again&s;t their nature, to be &s;ub&s;ervient to man. His mind does not receive the impre&s;|&s;ion of the moral world, in the &s;ame man|ner, as wax receives the impre&s;&s;ion of a &s;eal. It does not reflect the image of it, in the &s;ame manner, as a mirror reflects its images: it has a peculiar ca&s;t and turn given to its
<PB N="217" REF="222">
conceptions, admirably ordered to exalt vir|tue, to the highe&s;t pitch. The&s;e concepti|ons are indeed illu&s;ive, yet, which is wonder|ful, it is by this very circum&s;tance, that, in man, two of the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite things in na|ture, are happily reconciled, liberty and nece&s;|&s;ity; having this illu&s;trious effect, that in him are accumulated, all the prerogatives both of a nece&s;&s;ary and free agent. The di&s;covery of &s;uch a marvelous adju&s;tment, which is more directly oppo&s;ed to chance, than any other thing conceiveable, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily give us the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;i|on of a wi&s;e de&s;igning cau&s;e. And now a &s;ufficient rea&s;on appears, for &s;uffering man to make this &s;urpri&s;ing di&s;covery. The Al|mighty has let us &s;o far into his councils, as to afford the ju&s;te&s;t foundation, for admiring and adoring his wi&s;dom. It is a remark wor|thy to be made, that the capacities of man &s;eem, in general, to have a tendency beyond the wants and occa&s;ions of his pre&s;ent &s;tate. This has been often ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to his wi&s;hes and de&s;ires. The &s;ame holds
<PB N="218" REF="223">
as to his intellectual faculties, which, &s;ome|times, as in the in&s;tance before us, run be|yond the limits of what is &s;trictly nece&s;&s;ary for him to know, in his pre&s;ent circum&s;tan|ces, and let in upon him &s;ome glimmerings of higher and nobler di&s;coveries. A veil is thrown over nature, where it is not u&s;eful for him to behold it. And yet, &s;ometimes, by turning a&s;ide that veil a very little, he is admitted to a fuller view; that his admiration of nature, and the God of nature, may be increa&s;ed; that his curio&s;ity and love of truth may be fed; and, perhaps, that &s;ome <HI>augurium,</HI> &s;ome intimation, may be given, of his being de&s;igned for a future, more exalt|ed period of being; when attaining the full maturity of his nature, he &s;hall no longer &s;tand in need of artificial impre&s;&s;ions, but &s;hall feel and act according to the &s;tricte&s;t truth of things.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="essay">
<PB N="221" REF="225">
<HEAD>ESSAY I. <HI>Of</HI> BELIEF.</HEAD>
<P>BELIEF is a term &s;o familiar, as to have e&s;caped the inquiry of all philo&s;ophers, except the author of the treati&s;e of human nature. And yet the &s;ubject is, by no means, &s;o plain as to admit of no doubts nor difficul|ties. This author has made two propo&s;itions &s;ufficiently evident; fir&s;t, that belief is not any &s;eparate action or perception of the mind, but a modification of our perceptions, or a certain manner of conceiving propo&s;itions. 2d, That it does not accompany every one of our perceptions. A man, in &s;ome circum&s;tances, &s;ees objects double, but he does not believe them to be double. He can form the idea of a golden mountain: he can form the idea of it, as of a certain &s;ize, and as exi&s;ting in a certain place: but he does not believe it to be exi&s;ting.</P>
<P>HAVING proved that belief is not a &s;e|parate perception, but only a modification
<PB N="222" REF="226">
of &s;ome perceptions, our author goes on to explain the nature of this modification. And his doctrine is, that belief making no altera|tion upon the idea, as to its parts and compo|&s;ition, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in the lively manner of conceiving the idea; and that, in reality, a lively idea and belief are the &s;ame. I have a high opinion of this author's acutene&s;s and penetration; but no authority can prevail with me to embrace &s;uch a doctrine. For, at this rate, credulity and a lively imagination would be always connected, which does not hold in fact. Poetry and painting produce lively ideas, but they &s;eldom produce belief. For my part, I have no difficulty to form as lively a conception of Ce&s;ar's dying in his bed, de&s;canting upon the vanity of ambition, or dictating rules of government to his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, as of his being put to death in the &s;enate-hou&s;e. Nothing is told with more vivacity, than the death of Cyrus, in a pitch|ed battle with the queen of the Scythians, who dipped his head, as we are told, in a ve&s;&s;el full of blood, &s;aying, <Q>Satiate thy&s;elf
<PB N="223" REF="227">
with blood, of which thou wa&s;t ever thir|&s;ty.</Q> Yet, upon comparing circum&s;tan|ces and authors, the more probable opinion is, that Cyrus died in his bed.</P>
<P>IT may be ob&s;erved, at the &s;ame time, that the conclu&s;ion is very lame, which this author draws from his premi&s;es. Belief makes no alteration upon the idea, as to its parts and compo&s;ition. It can only therefore con&s;i&s;t in a modification of the idea. But does it follow, that it con&s;i&s;ts in a lively concepti|tion of the idea, which is but one of many modifications? There is not here the &s;ha|dow of an inference.</P>
<P>OUR author indeed urges, that true hi&s;to|ry takes fa&s;t hold of the mind, and pre&s;ents its objects in a more lively manner, than any fabulous narration can do. Every man mu&s;t judge for him&s;elf: I cannot admit this to be my ca&s;e. Hi&s;tory, no doubt, takes fa&s;t|er hold of the mind, than any fiction told in the plain hi&s;torical &s;tile. But can any
<PB N="224" REF="228">
man doubt, who has not an hypothe&s;is to de|fend, that poetry makes a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;i|on than hi&s;tory? Let a man, if he has feelings, attend the celebrated Garrick in the character of Richard, or in that of king Le|ar; and he will find, that dramatic repre|&s;entations make &s;trong and lively impre&s;&s;i|ons, which hi&s;tory &s;eldom comes up to.</P>
<P>BUT now, if it &s;hall be &s;uppo&s;ed, that hi&s;tory pre&s;ents its objects in a more lively manner, than can be done by dramatic or epic poetry; it will not therefore follow, that a lively idea is the &s;ame with belief. I read a pa&s;&s;age in Virgil. Let it be the epi&s;ode of Ni&s;us and Euryalus. I read a pa&s;&s;age in Li|vy, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> the &s;acking of Rome by the Gauls. If I have a more lively idea of the latter &s;to|ry, I put it to my author, to point out the cau&s;e of this effect. He &s;urely will not af|firm, that it is the force of expre&s;&s;ion, or harmony of numbers: for, in the&s;e parti|culars, the hi&s;torian cannot be compared to the poet. It is evident, that no other &s;ati&s;|factory
<PB N="225" REF="229">
account of the matter can be given, but this, that Livy's &s;uperior influence up|on the imagination, is the effect of his being con&s;idered, as a true hi&s;torian. The mo&s;t, then, that our author can make of his ob&s;er|vation, &s;uppo&s;ing it to hold true in fact, is, that the authority of the hi&s;torian produces belief, and that belief produces a more live|ly idea, than any fabulous narration can do. The truth of the matter is, that belief and a lively conception, are really two di&s;tinct modi|fications of the idea; which, tho' often con|joined, are not only &s;eparable in the imagi|nation, but in fact are often &s;eparated. Truth, indeed, be&s;tows a certain degree of vivacity upon our ideas. At the &s;ame time, I cannot admit, that hi&s;tory exceeds drama|tic or epic poetry, in conveying a lively con|ception of facts; becau&s;e it appears evident, that, in works of imagination, the want of truth, is more than compen&s;ated by &s;enti|ment and language.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="230">
SOMETIMES, indeed, belief is the re&s;ult of a lively impre&s;&s;ion. A dramatic repre&s;enta|tion is one in&s;tance, when it affects us &s;o much, as to draw off the attention from eve|ry other object, and even from our&s;elves. In this &s;ituation, we don't con&s;ider the actor, but conceive him to be the very man who&s;e character he a&s;&s;umes. We have that very man before our eyes. We perceive him as exi&s;ting and acting, and believe him to be exi&s;ting and acting. This belief, however, is but momentary. It vani&s;hes, like a dream, &s;o &s;oon as we are rouzed by any trivial cir|cum&s;tance, to a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our&s;elves, and of the place we are in. Nor is the live|ly impre&s;&s;ion, even in this ca&s;e, the cau&s;e of belief, but only the occa&s;ion of it, by di|verting the attention of the mind, from it|&s;elf and its &s;ituation. It is in &s;ome &s;uch manner, that the idea of a &s;pectre in the dark, which fills the mind, and diverts it from it&s;elf, is, by the force of imagination, converted into a reality. We think we &s;ee
<PB N="227" REF="231">
and hear it. We are convinced of it, and believe the matter to be &s;o.</P>
<P>REJECTING therefore this author's opi|nion, the real truth appears to be this. There is a certain peculiar manner of perceiving objects, and conceiving propo&s;itions, which, being a &s;imple feeling, cannot be de&s;cribed, but is expre&s;&s;ed by the word belief. The cau&s;es of this modification, termed belief, are the authority of my own &s;en&s;es, and the authority of others, who either relate facts upon the authority of their &s;en&s;es, or what they have heard at &s;econd or third hand. So that belief, mediately or immedi|ately, is founded upon the authority of our &s;en&s;es. We are &s;o con&s;tituted by nature, as to put tru&s;t in our &s;en&s;es. Nor, in general, is it in our power to disbelieve our &s;en&s;es: they have authority with us irre&s;i&s;tible. There is but one exception that I can think of. Finding, by experience, that we have been &s;ometimes led into an error, by tru&s;t|ing &s;ome particular perceptions, the remem|brance
<PB N="228" REF="232">
of the&s;e in&s;tances, counter-balances the authority of our perception in the like ca&s;es, and either keeps the mind &s;u&s;pended, or, perhaps, makes it re&s;t in a conviction, that the perception is erroneous.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the evidence of my own &s;en&s;es, tho' I cannot admit, that the e&s;&s;ence of belief con&s;i&s;ts in the vivacity of the im|pre&s;&s;ion, I &s;o far agree with our author, that vivacity and belief, in this ca&s;e, are al|ways conjoined. A mountain I have once &s;een, I believe to be exi&s;ting, tho' I am a thou&s;and miles from it; and the image or idea I have of that mountain, is more lively and more di&s;tinct, than of any I can form merely by the force of imagination. But this is far from being the ca&s;e, as above ob|&s;erved, of ideas rai&s;ed in my mind by the force of language.</P>
<P>BELIEF ari&s;ing from the evidence of o|thers, re&s;ts upon a different foundation. Ve|racity and a di&s;po&s;ition to believe, are corre|&s;ponding
<PB N="229" REF="233">
principles in the nature of man; and, in the main, the&s;e principles are &s;o ad|ju&s;ted, that men are not often deceived. The di&s;po&s;ition we have to believe, is qualified by the opinion we have of the witne&s;s, and the nature of the &s;tory he relates. But, &s;up|po&s;ing a concurrence of all other circum|&s;tances to prompt our belief, yet, if the &s;peak|er pretends only to amu&s;e, without confining him&s;elf to truth, his narration will not, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, prompt our belief; let him enliven it with the &s;tronge&s;t colours that poetry is ma&s;ter of.</P>
<P>I HAVE only to add, that tho' our own &s;en&s;es, and the te&s;timony of others, are the proper cau&s;es of belief; yet that the&s;e cau&s;es are more or le&s;s efficacious, according to the temper of mind we are in at the time. Hope and fear are influenced by pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o is belief. Hope and fear are modifications of our con|ception of future events. If the event be agree|able, and the probability of its exi&s;tence, be great, our conception of its exi&s;tence takes
<PB N="230" REF="234">
on a modification, which is called hope. If the event be extremely agreeable, and the probability of its exi&s;ting do greatly pre|ponderate, our hope is increa&s;ed proportion|ally, and &s;ometimes is converted into a firm belief, that it will really happen. Upon weak minds, the delightfulne&s;s of the ex|pected event, will of it&s;elf have that effect. The imagination, fired with the pro&s;pect, augments the probability, 'till it convert it to a firm per&s;ua&s;ion or belief. On the other hand, if fear get the a&s;cendent, by a con|ceived improbability of the exi&s;tence of the event, the mind de&s;ponds, and fear is con|verted into a firm belief, that the event will not happen. The operations of the mind are quite &s;imilar, where the event in view is di&s;agreeable.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY II. <HI>Of the</HI> IDEA <HI>of</HI> SELF <HI>and of</HI> PERSONAL IDENTITY.</HEAD>
<P>HAD we no original impre&s;&s;ions but tho&s;e of the external &s;en&s;es, accord|ing to the author of the treati&s;e of human nature, we never could have any con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of <HI>&s;elf;</HI> becau&s;e &s;uch con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s can|not ari&s;e from any external &s;en&s;e.

<P>BEINGS there may be, who are thus con|&s;tituted: but man is none of the&s;e beings. It is an undoubted truth, that he has an o|riginal feeling, or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of him&s;elf,
<PB N="232" REF="236">
and of his exi&s;tence; which, for the mo&s;t part, accompanies every one of his impre&s;&s;i|ons and ideas, and every action of his mind and body. I &s;ay, for the mo&s;t part; for the faculty or internal &s;en&s;e, which is the cau&s;e of this peculiar perception, is not al|ways in action. In a dead &s;leep, we have no con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;elf. We dream &s;ometimes without this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s: and even &s;ome of our waking hours pa&s;s without it. A reverie is nothing el&s;e, but a wandering of the mind through its ideas, without carrying along the perception of &s;elf.</P>
<P>THIS con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s or perception of &s;elf, is, at the &s;ame time, of the livelie&s;t kind. Self-pre&s;ervation is every one's peculiar du|ty; and the vivacity of this perception, is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make us attentive to our own in|tere&s;t, and, particularly, to &s;hun every appear|ance of danger. When a man is in a reve|rie, he has no circum&s;pection, nor any man|ner of attention to his own intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="237">
'TIS remarkable, that one has &s;carce any chance to fall a&s;leep, 'till this perception vani&s;h. Its vivacity keeps the mind in a certain degree of agitation, which bars &s;leep. A fall of water di&s;po&s;es to &s;leep. It fixes the attention, both by &s;ound and &s;ight, and, without creating much agitation, occu|pies the mind, &s;o as to make it forget it&s;elf. Reading of &s;ome books has the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>IT is this perception, or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;elf, carried through all the different &s;ta|ges of life, and all the variety of action, which is the foundation of <HI>per&s;onal identity.</HI> It is, by means of this perception, that I con&s;ider my&s;elf to be the &s;ame per&s;on, in all varieties of fortune, and every change of circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>THE main purpo&s;e of this &s;hort e&s;&s;ay, is to introduce an ob&s;ervation, that it is not by any argument or rea&s;oning, I conclude my|&s;elf to be the &s;ame per&s;on, I was ten years ago. This conclu&s;ion re&s;ts entirely upon the feeling
<PB N="234" REF="238">
of identity, which accompanies me through all my changes, and which is the only con|necting principle, that binds together, all the various thoughts and actions of my life. Far le&s;s is it by any argument, or chain of rea&s;oning, that I di&s;cover my own exi&s;tence. It would be &s;trange indeed, if every man's exi&s;tence was kept a &s;ecret from him, 'till the celebrated argument was invented, that <HI>co|gito ergo &s;um.</HI> And if a fact, that, to com|mon under&s;tanding, appears &s;elf-evident, is not to be relied on without an argument; why &s;hould I take for granted, without an argument, that I think, more than that I exi&s;t? For &s;urely I am not more con&s;cious of thinking, than of exi&s;ting.</P>
<P>UPON this &s;ubject, I &s;hall ju&s;t &s;ugge&s;t a thought, which will be more fully in&s;i&s;ted on afterwards; that any doctrine, which leads to a di&s;tru&s;t of our &s;en&s;es, mu&s;t land in univer&s;al &s;ceptici&s;m. If natural feelings, whether from internal or external &s;en&s;es, are not admitted as evidence of truth, I can|not
<PB N="235" REF="239">
&s;ee, that we can be certain of any fact whatever. It is clear, from what is now ob|&s;erved, that, upon this &s;ceptical &s;y&s;tem, we can|not be certain even of our own exi&s;tence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The deceitful feeling of liberty, unfolded in the e&s;&s;ay upon liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, may perhaps embarra&s;s &s;ome readers, as in &s;ome mea&s;ure contradictory to the po&s;ition here laid down. But the matter is ea&s;ily cleared. Natural feelings are &s;atisfying evidence of truth; and, in fact, have full authority over us, unle&s;s in &s;ome &s;ingular ca&s;es, where we are admoni&s;hed by counter-feelings, or by rea&s;oning, not to give implicit tru&s;t. This is a &s;ufficient foundation for all the arguments, that are built upon the authority of our &s;en&s;es, in point of evidence. The feeling of liberty is a very &s;ingular ca&s;e. The rea&s;ons are clearly traced for the nece&s;&s;ity of this delu&s;ive feeling, which di&s;tingui&s;hes it in a very particular manner, and leaves no room, to draw any con&s;equence from it, to our other feelings. But there is, be&s;ides, a circum&s;tance yet more di&s;tingui&s;hing, in this delu&s;ive feeling of liberty, which entirely exempts it, from being an exception to the general rule above laid down. It is this; that the feeling is by no means entire on the &s;ide of liberty. It is counter-balanced by other feelings, which, in many in&s;tances, afford &s;uch a conviction of the nece&s;&s;ary influence of motives, that phy&s;ical and moral nece&s;&s;ity can &s;carce be di&s;tingui&s;hed. The &s;en&s;e of liberty operates chiefly in the after reflection. But, previous to the action, there is no di&s;tinct or clear feeling, that it can happen otherways, than in connection with its proper motive. Here the feel|ings being, on the whole, oppo&s;ite to each other, nothing can be inferred from this ca&s;e, to derogate from the evi|dence of feelings that are clear, cogent and authoritative; and to which, nothing can be oppo&s;ed, from the &s;ide of rea|&s;on or counter-feelings. So that our principle remains &s;afe and un&s;haken, that a general di&s;tru&s;t of our &s;en&s;es, internal or external, mu&s;t land us in univer&s;al &s;ceptici&s;m.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY III. <HI>Of the</HI> AUTHORITY <HI>of our</HI> SENSES.</HEAD>
<P>IN a former e&s;&s;ay are pointed out &s;ome in|&s;tances, in which our &s;en&s;es may be call|ed deceitful <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay upon liberty and nece&s;&s;ity.</NOTE>. They are of two &s;orts. One is, when the deception is occa&s;ioned by in|di&s;po&s;ition of the organ, remotene&s;s of place, gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the medium, or the like; which di&s;tort the appearances of objects, and make them be &s;een double, or greater or le&s;s, than they really are. In &s;uch in&s;tances, the per|ception is always faint, ob&s;cure or confu&s;|ed: and they noway invalidate the authori|ty of the &s;en&s;es, in general, when, ab&s;tract|ing from &s;uch accidental ob&s;tructions, the perception is lively, &s;trong and di&s;tinct. In the other &s;ort, there is a deception e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by the laws of nature; as in the ca&s;e of &s;econdary qualities, taken notice of in that e&s;&s;ay; whence it was inferred, that nature does not always give us &s;uch correct per|ceptions, as corre&s;pond to the philo&s;ophic
<PB N="238" REF="242">
truth of things. Notwith&s;tanding of which, the te&s;timony of our &s;en&s;es &s;till remains, as a &s;ufficient ground of confidence and tru&s;t. For, in all the&s;e ca&s;es, where there is this &s;ort of e&s;tabli&s;hed deception, nature furni&s;hes means for coming at the truth. As in this very in|&s;tance of &s;econdary qualities, philo&s;ophy ea|&s;ily corrects the fal&s;e appearances, and teach|es us, that they are rather to be con&s;idered, as impre&s;&s;ions made upon the mind, than as qualities of the object. A remedy being thus provided to the deception, our belief, &s;o far as it can be influenced by rea&s;on, is the more confirmed, with regard to our other &s;en&s;ati|ons, where there is no appearance of illu&s;i|on. But this is not the whole of the matter. When any &s;en&s;e pre&s;ents to our view, an ap|pearance that may be called deceitful, we plainly di&s;cover &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;e intend|ed. The deceit is not the effect of an im|perfect or arbitrary con&s;titution; but wi&s;ely contrived, to give us &s;uch notice of things, as may be&s;t &s;uit the purpo&s;es of life. From this very con&s;ideration, we are the more confirm|ed
<PB N="239" REF="243">
in the veracity of nature. Particular in|&s;tances, in which, our &s;en&s;es are accommo|dated to the u&s;es of life, rather than to the &s;trictne&s;s of truth, are rational exceptions, which &s;erve, the more firmly, to e&s;tabli&s;h the general rule. And, indeed, when we have nothing but our &s;en&s;es to direct our conduct, with regard to external objects, it would be &s;trange, if there &s;hould be any ju&s;t ground, for a general di&s;tru&s;t of them. But there is no &s;uch thing. There is nothing to which all mankind are more nece&s;&s;arily determin|ed, than to put confidence in their &s;en&s;es. We entertain no doubt of their authority, be|cau&s;e we are &s;o con&s;tituted, that it is not in our power to doubt.</P>
<P>WHEN the authority of our &s;en&s;es is thus founded on the nece&s;&s;ity of our nature, and confirmed by con&s;tant experience, it cannot but appear &s;trange, that it &s;hould come into the thought of any man to call it in que&s;ti|on. But the influence of novelty is great; and when a bold genius, in &s;pite of common
<PB N="240" REF="244">
&s;en&s;e, and common feelings, will &s;trike out new paths to him&s;elf, 'tis not ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, how far his airy metaphy&s;ical notions may carry him. A late author, who gives us a treati&s;e concerning the principles of human knowledge, by denying the reality of ex|ternal objects, &s;trikes at the root of the au|thority of our &s;en&s;es, and thereby paves the way to the mo&s;t inveterate &s;ceptici&s;m. For what reliance can we have upon our &s;en&s;es, if they deceive us in a point &s;o material? If we can be prevailed upon, to doubt of the reality of external objects, the next &s;tep will be, to doubt of what pa&s;&s;es in our own minds, of the reality of our ideas and per|ceptions. For we have not a &s;tronger con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, nor a clearer conviction of the one, than of the other. And the la&s;t &s;tep will be, to doubt of our own exi&s;tence; for it is &s;hown in the e&s;&s;ay immediately forego|ing, that we have no certainty of this fact, but what depends upon &s;en&s;e and feeling.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="245">
IT is reported, that doctor Berkeley, the author of the abovementioned treati&s;e, was moved to adopt this whim&s;ical opinion, to get free of &s;ome arguments, urged by materi|ali&s;ts again&s;t the exi&s;tence of the Deity. If &s;o, he has been unhappy in his experiment; for this doctrine, if it &s;hould not lead to u|niver&s;al &s;ceptici&s;m, affords, at lea&s;t, a &s;hrewd argument in favours of Athei&s;m. If I can only be con&s;cious of what pa&s;&s;es in my own mind, and if I cannot tru&s;t my &s;en&s;es, when they give me notice of external and indepen|dent exi&s;tences; it follows, that I am the only being in the world; at lea&s;t, that I can have no evidence from my &s;en&s;es, of any other being, body or &s;pirit. This is certainly an un|wary conce&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e it deprives us of our principal, or only, inlet to the knowledge of the Deity. Laying a&s;ide &s;en&s;e and feel|ing, this learned divine will find it a difficult task, to point out by what other means it is, that we make the di&s;covery of the above im|portant truth. But of this more afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="246">
WERE there nothing el&s;e in view, but to e&s;tabli&s;h the reality of external objects, it would be &s;carce worth while, to be&s;tow much thought, in &s;olving metaphy&s;ical paradoxes again&s;t their exi&s;tence, which are better con|futed by common &s;en&s;e and experience. But, as the above doctrine appears to have very exten&s;ive con&s;equences, and to &s;trike at the root of the mo&s;t valuable branches of hum|an knowledge; an attempt to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the authority of our &s;en&s;es, by detecting the fal|lacy of the arguments that have been urged again&s;t it, may, it is hoped, not be unaccept|able to the public. The attempt, at any rate, is nece&s;&s;ary in this work, the main pur|po&s;e of which is, to &s;how that our &s;en&s;es, ex|ternal and internal, are the true &s;ources, from whence the knowledge of the Deity is de|rived to us.</P>
<P>IN order to afford &s;atisfaction upon a &s;ub|ject, which is ea&s;ier felt than expre&s;t, it will be proper, to give a di&s;tinct analy&s;is of the o|perations of tho&s;e &s;en&s;es, by which we per|ceive
<PB N="243" REF="247">
external objects. And, if this be once clearly apprehended, it will not be a matter of difficulty, to an&s;wer the &s;everal objections, which have been urged again&s;t their exi&s;t|ence.</P>
<P>THE impre&s;&s;ions of the external &s;en&s;es are of different kinds. Some we have at the organs of &s;en&s;e, &s;uch as &s;melling, ta&s;ting, touching. Some are made upon us as from a di&s;tance, &s;uch as hearing and &s;eeing. From the &s;en&s;e of feeling, are derived the impre&s;&s;i|ons of body, &s;olidity and external exi&s;tence. Laying my hand upon this table, I perceive a thing &s;mooth and hard, pre&s;&s;ing upon my hand, and which is perceived as more di&s;tant from me, than my hand is. From the &s;ight, we have the impre&s;&s;ions of motion and of co|lour; and from the &s;ight as well as from the touch, tho&s;e of exten&s;ion and figure. But it is more material to ob&s;erve, upon the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, that from &s;ight as well as touch, we have the impre&s;&s;ion of things
<PB N="244" REF="248">
as having an independent and continued or permanent exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>LET us endeavour to explain this modifi|cation of independency and permanent ex|i&s;tence of the objects of &s;ight and touch, for it is a cardinal point. To begin with the objects of &s;ight. I ca&s;t my eye upon a tree, and perceive colour, figure, extention, and &s;ometimes motion. If this be a com|plete analy&s;is of the perception, &s;ub&s;tance is not di&s;coverable by &s;ight. But upon atten|tively examining this perception, to try if there be any thing more in it, I find one cir|cum&s;tance omitted, that the above particulars, are not perceived as &s;o many &s;eparate exi&s;t|ences, having no relation to each other, but as clo&s;ely united and connected. When look|ing around on different objects, I perceive colour in one quarter, motion in a &s;econd, and exten&s;ion in a third; the appearance the&s;e make in my mind, are in nothing &s;imilar to the impre&s;&s;ion made by a tree, where the exten&s;ion, motion, and other qualities, are
<PB N="245" REF="249">
introduced into the mind, under the modi|fication of an intimate connection and uni|on. But in what manner are they united and connected? Of this, every per&s;on can give an account, that they are perceived as inhering in, or belonging to &s;ome <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> or <HI>thing,</HI> of which they are <HI>qualities;</HI> and that, by their reference to this &s;ub&s;tance or thing, they are thus clo&s;ely united and connected. Thus it is, that the impre&s;&s;ion of <HI>&s;ub&s;tance,</HI> as well as of <HI>qualities,</HI> is derived from &s;ight. And it is al&s;o to be attended to, as a part of the total impre&s;&s;ion, that as the qualities appear to belong to their &s;ub&s;tance, and to inhere in it, &s;o both the &s;ub&s;tance and its qualities, which we call the tree, are perceived as al|together independent of us, as really exi&s;t|ing, and as having a permanent exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>A SIMILAR impre&s;&s;ion is made upon us, by means of the &s;en&s;e of feeling. It is ob|&s;erved above, that, from the touch, we have the impre&s;&s;ions, of body, &s;olidity and exter|nal
<PB N="246" REF="250">
exi&s;tence; and we have, from the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, the impre&s;&s;ions of &s;oftne&s;s and hard|ne&s;s, &s;moothne&s;s and roughne&s;s. Now, when I lay my hand upon this table, I have an impre&s;&s;ion, not only of &s;moothne&s;s, hard|ne&s;s, figure and exten&s;ion, but al&s;o of a thing I call <HI>body,</HI> of which the above are per|ceived as <HI>qualities.</HI> Smoothne&s;s, hardne&s;s, exten&s;ion and figure are felt, not as &s;eparate and unconnected exi&s;tences, but as inher|ing in and belonging to &s;omething I call <HI>bo|dy,</HI> which is really exi&s;ting, and which has an independent and permanent exi&s;tence. And it is this body, with its &s;everal qualities, which I expre&s;s by the word <HI>table.</HI></P>
<P>THE above analy&s;is of the impre&s;&s;ions of &s;ight and touch, will be be&s;t illu&s;trated, by a compari&s;on with the impre&s;&s;ions made by the other &s;en&s;es. I hear a &s;ound, or I feel a &s;mell. Attending to the&s;e impre&s;&s;i|ons, I perceive nothing but &s;ound or &s;mell. They are not perceived as the qualities or properties of any body, thing or &s;ub&s;tance.
<PB N="247" REF="251">
They make their appearance in the mind as &s;imple exi&s;tences; and there is no impre&s;&s;i|on made of independency, or permanent exi&s;tence. Did &s;eeing and feeling carry us no further, we never could have the lea&s;t conception of &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>'TIS not a little &s;urpri&s;ing, that philo&s;o|phers, who di&s;cour&s;e &s;o currently of <HI>qualities,</HI> &s;hould affect &s;o much doubt and he&s;itation a|bout <HI>&s;ub&s;tance;</HI> &s;eeing the&s;e are relative ideas, and imply each other. For what other rea|&s;on do we call figure a quality, but that we perceive it, not as a &s;eparate exi&s;tence, but as belonging to &s;omething that is figured; and which thing we call <HI>&s;ub&s;tance,</HI> becau&s;e it is not a property of any other thing, but is a thing which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by it&s;elf, or has an in|dependent exi&s;tence. Did we perceive fi|gure, as we perceive &s;ound, it would not be con&s;idered as a quality. In a word, a qua|lity is not intelligible, unle&s;s upon &s;uppo&s;iti|on of &s;ome other thing, of which it is the quality. Sounds indeed, and &s;mells are al&s;o
<PB N="248" REF="252">
con&s;idered as qualities. But this proceeds from habit, not from original perception. For, having once acquired the di&s;tinction be|twixt a <HI>thing</HI> and its <HI>qualities,</HI> and finding &s;ound and &s;mell, more to re&s;emble <HI>qualities</HI> than <HI>&s;ub&s;tances,</HI> we readily come into the u&s;e of con&s;idering them as qualities.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing is to be ob&s;erved with regard to tho&s;e things, which are perceived as qualities by the &s;ight and touch; that we cannot form a conception of them, indepen|dent of the beings to which they belong. It is not in our power, to &s;eparate, even in imagination, colour, figure, motion and ex|ten&s;ion from body or &s;ub&s;tance. There is no &s;uch thing as conceiving motion by it&s;elf, ab&s;tracted from &s;ome body which is in mo|tion. Let us try ever &s;o often, our attempts will be in vain, to form an idea of a triangle independent of a body which has that figure. We cannot conceive a body that is not fi|gured; and we can as little conceive a figure without a body; for this would be to con|ceive
<PB N="249" REF="253">
a figure, as having a &s;eparate exi&s;tence, at the &s;ame time, that we conceive it, as hav|ing no &s;eparate exi&s;tence; or to conceive it, at once, to be a quality, and not a quality. Thus it comes out, that <HI>&s;ub&s;tance,</HI> as well as <HI>quality,</HI> makes a part, not only of every per|ception of &s;ight and touch, but of every con|ception we can form, of colour, figure, exten|&s;ion and motion. Taking in the whole train of our ideas, there is not one more familiar to us, than that of <HI>&s;ub&s;tance,</HI> a being or thing which has qualities.</P>
<P>WHEN the&s;e things are con&s;idered, I can|not readily di&s;cover, by what wrong con|ception of the matter, Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> has been led, to talk &s;o ob&s;curely and indi&s;tinctly of the idea of &s;ub&s;tance. 'Tis no wonder, he &s;hould be difficulted, to form an idea of &s;ub|&s;tance in general, ab&s;tracted from all proper|ties, when &s;uch ab&s;traction is altogether be|yond the reach of our conception. But there is nothing more ea&s;y, than to form an idea of any particular &s;ub&s;tance with its pro|perties.
<PB N="250" REF="254">
Yet this has &s;ome how e&s;caped him. When he forms the idea of a hor&s;e or a &s;tone, he admits nothing into the idea, but a collection of &s;everal &s;imple ideas of &s;en&s;ible qualities <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Book 2d, chap. 23.</NOTE> <Q>And becau&s;e, &s;ays he, we cannot conceive how the&s;e qualities &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone, nor one in another, we &s;up|po&s;e them exi&s;ting in, and &s;upported by &s;ome common &s;ubject; which &s;upport, we denote by the name <HI>&s;ub&s;tance,</HI> tho' it be certain, we have no clear or di&s;tinct idea of that thing we &s;uppo&s;e a &s;upport.</Q> A &s;ingle que&s;tion would have unfolded the whole my&s;tery. How comes it, that we cannot conceive qualities to &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone, nor one in another? Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> him&s;elf mu&s;t have given the following an&s;wer, that the thing is not conceiveable; becau&s;e a proper|ty or quality cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the thing to which it belongs; for, if it did, that it would cea&s;e to be a property or quality. Why then does he make &s;o faint an infe|rence, as that we &s;uppo&s;e qualities exi&s;ting in, and &s;upported by &s;ome common &s;ubject? It
<PB N="251" REF="255">
is not a bare &s;uppo&s;ition: it is an e&s;&s;ential part of the idea: it is nece&s;&s;arily &s;ugge&s;ted to us by &s;ight and touch. He ob&s;erves that we have no clear nor di&s;tinct idea of &s;ub&s;tance. If he means, that we have no clear nor di&s;tinct idea of &s;ub&s;tance ab&s;tract|ed from its properties, the thing is &s;o true, that we can form no idea of &s;ub&s;tance at all, ab&s;tracted from its properties. But it is al&s;o true, that we can form no idea of properties, ab|&s;tracted from a &s;ub&s;tance. The ideas both of &s;ub&s;tance and of quality are perfectly in the &s;ame condition, in this re&s;pect; which, 'tis &s;ur|pri&s;ing, philo&s;ophers &s;hould &s;o little attend to. At the &s;ame time, we have clear and di&s;tinct ideas, of many things as they exi&s;t; tho' perhaps we have not a complete idea of any one thing. We have &s;uch ideas of things, as &s;erve to all the u&s;eful purpo&s;es of life. 'Tis true, our &s;en&s;es don't reach be|yond the external properties of beings. We have no direct perception of the e&s;&s;ence and internal properties of any thing. The&s;e we di&s;cover from the effects produced. But had we &s;en&s;es directly to perceive the e&s;&s;ence and
<PB N="252" REF="256">
internal properties of things, our idea of them would indeed be more full and complete, but not more clear and di&s;tinct, than at pre|&s;ent. For, even upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, we could form no notion of &s;ub&s;tance, but by its properties internal and external. To form an idea of a thing ab&s;tracted from all its properties, is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE following is the &s;um of what is above laid down. By &s;ight and touch, we have the impre&s;&s;ions of &s;ub&s;tance and body, as well as of qualities. It is not figure, exten&s;ion, mo|tion, that we perceive; but a thing figured, extended and moving. As we cannot form an idea of &s;ub&s;tance ab&s;tracted from quali|ties, &s;o we cannot form an idea of qualities ab&s;tracted from &s;ub&s;tance. They are rela|tive ideas, and imply each other. This is one point gained. Another is, that the idea of &s;ub&s;tance or body, thus attained, compre|hends in it, independent and permanent ex|i&s;tence; that is, &s;omething which exi&s;ts in|dependent of our perceptions, and remains the &s;ame, whether we perceive it or not.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="257">
IN this manner are we made &s;en&s;ible of the real exi&s;tence of things without us. The feeling is &s;o &s;trong, and the conviction which makes a part of the feeling, that &s;ceptical arguments, however cunningly devi&s;ed, may puzzle, but can never get the better: for &s;uch is our con&s;titution, that we can enter|tain no doubt of the authority of our &s;en&s;es, in this particular. At the &s;ame time, every &s;ort of experience confirms the truth of our perceptions. I &s;ee a tree at a di&s;tance, of a certain &s;hape and &s;ize. Walking forward, I find it in its place, by the re&s;i&s;tance it makes to my body; and, &s;o far as I can di&s;cover by touch, it is of the &s;ame &s;hape and &s;ize, which my eye repre&s;ents it to be. I return day af|ter day, year after year, and find the &s;ame object, with no other variation, but what the &s;ea&s;ons and time produce. The tree is at la&s;t cut down. It is no longer to be &s;een or felt.</P>
<P>To overthrow the authority of our &s;en|&s;es, a few particular in&s;tances, in which they
<PB N="254" REF="258">
appear fallacious, are of no weight. And to confirm this branch of the argument, we need but compare the evidence of our &s;en|&s;es, with the evidence of human te&s;timony. The compari&s;on cannot fail to afford &s;atis|faction. Veracity, and a di&s;po&s;ition to rely upon human evidence, are corre&s;ponding principles, which greatly promote &s;ociety. Among individuals, the&s;e principles are found to be of different degrees of &s;trength. But, in the main, they are &s;o proportioned to each other, that men are not often deceived. In this ca&s;e, it would be but a bad argument, that we ought not to give credit to any man's te&s;timony, becau&s;e &s;ome men are defective in the principle of veracity. The only ef|fect &s;uch in&s;tances have, or ought to have, is to correct our propen&s;ity to believe, and to bring on a habit of &s;u&s;pending our belief, 'till circum&s;tances be examined. The evi|dence of our &s;en&s;es, ri&s;es undoubtedly much higher, than the evidence of human te&s;timo|ny. And if we continue to put tru&s;t in the latter, after many in&s;tances of being deceiv|ed,
<PB N="255" REF="259">
we have better rea&s;on to put tru&s;t in the former, were the in&s;tances of being deceiv|ed equally numerous; which is plainly not the fact. When people are in &s;ound health of mind and body, they are very &s;eldom mi&s;-led by their &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>IF I have been &s;o lucky, as to put this &s;ubject in its proper light, it will not be a difficult task to clear it of any doubts which may ari&s;e, upon peru&s;ing the above mentioned treati&s;e. The author boldly de|nies the exi&s;tence of matter, and the re|ality of the objects of &s;en&s;e; contending, that there is nothing really exi&s;ting without the mind of an intelligent being; in a word, re|ducing all to be a world of ideas. <Q>It is an opinion &s;trangely prevailing among men, (&s;ays he) that hou&s;es, mountains, rivers, and, in a word, all &s;en&s;ible objects, have an exi&s;tence, natural or real, di&s;tinct from their being perceived by the under&s;tand|ing.</Q> He ventures to call this a manife&s;t contradiction; and his argument again&s;t the
<PB N="256" REF="260">
reality of the&s;e objects, is in the following words. <Q>The forementioned objects are things perceived by &s;en&s;e. We cannot perceive any thing, but our own ideas or perceptions; therefore, what we call men, hou&s;es, mountains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> can be nothing el&s;e but ideas or perceptions.</Q> This ar|gument &s;hall be examined afterwards, with the re&s;pect that is due to its author. It &s;hall only be taken notice of by the way, that, &s;uppo&s;ing mankind to be under &s;o &s;trange and unaccountable a delu&s;ion, as to mi&s;take their ideas for men, hou&s;es, mountains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it will not follow, that there is in this, any manife&s;t contradiction, or any contradiction at all. For deception is a very different thing from contradiction. But he falls from this high preten&s;ion, in the after part of his work, to argue more con&s;i&s;tently, <Q>that, &s;uppo&s;|ing &s;olid, figured, and moveable &s;ub&s;tan|ces, to exi&s;t without the mind, yet we could never come to the knowledge of this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 18.</NOTE>.</Q> Which is true, if our &s;en&s;es
<PB N="257" REF="261">
bear no te&s;timony of the fact. And he adds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 20.</NOTE>, <Q>that, &s;uppo&s;ing no bodies to exi&s;t without the mind, we might have the ve|ry &s;ame rea&s;ons for &s;uppo&s;ing the exi&s;tence of external bodies, that we have now:</Q> which may be true, &s;uppo&s;ing only our &s;en|&s;es to be fallacious.</P>
<P>THE doctor's fundamental propo&s;ition is, that we can perceive nothing but our own ideas or perceptions. This, at be&s;t, is an ambiguous expre&s;&s;ion. For, taking percep|tion or &s;en&s;ation in its proper &s;en&s;e, as &s;igni|fying every object we perceive, it is a mere identical propo&s;ition, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> that we perceive nothing but what we perceive. But, taking the doctor's propo&s;ition as he intended it, that we can have no perception or con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of any thing, but what exi&s;ts in our own minds, he had certainly no rea&s;on to take this a&s;&s;ertion for granted; and yet he has never once attempted a proof of it: tho', in &s;o bold an undertaking, as that of annihilat|ing
<PB N="258" REF="262">
the whole univer&s;e, his own mind ex|cepted, he had no rea&s;on to hope, that an a&s;&s;ertion, &s;o &s;ingular, and &s;o contradictory to common &s;en&s;e and feeling, would be taken upon his word. It may be true, that it is not ea&s;y to explain, nor even to comprehend, by what means we perceive external objects. But our ignorance is, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, a very indifferent argument again&s;t matter of fact. At this rate, he may take upon him equal|ly to deny the bulk of the operations in the natural world, which have not hitherto been explained by him, or others. And at, bot|tom, 'tis perhaps as difficult to explain the manner of perceiving our own ideas, or the impre&s;&s;ions made upon us, as to explain the manner of perceiving external objects. The doctor, be&s;ides, ought to have con&s;idered, that by this bold doctrine, he, in effect, &s;ets bounds to the power of nature, or of the Author of nature. If it was in the power of the Almighty, to be&s;tow upon man, a facul|ty of perceiving external objects, he has cer|tainly done it. For, &s;uppo&s;ing the exi&s;tence
<PB N="259" REF="263">
of external objects, we have no conception, how they could be otherways manife&s;ted to us, than in fact they are. Therefore, the doctor was in the right to a&s;&s;ert, that a fa|culty in man to perceive external objects, would be a contradiction, and con&s;equently a privilege not in the power of the Deity to be&s;tow upon him. He perceived the nece&s;|&s;ity of carrying his argument &s;o far; at the &s;ame time, &s;en&s;ible that this was not to be made out, he never once attempts to point at any thing like a contradiction. And if he cannot prove it to be a contradiction, the que&s;tion is at an end; for, &s;uppo&s;ing only the fact to be po&s;&s;ible, we have the very highe&s;t evidence of its reality, that our na|ture is capable of, no le&s;s than the te&s;timo|ny of our &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>IT has been urged in &s;upport of the above doctrine, that nothing is pre&s;ent to the mind, but the impre&s;&s;ions made upon it, and that it cannot be con&s;cious of any thing but what is pre&s;ent. This difficulty is ea&s;ily &s;olved.
<PB N="260" REF="264">
For the propo&s;ition, that we cannot be con|&s;cious of any thing but what is pre&s;ent to the mind, or pa&s;&s;es within it, is taken for granted, as if it were &s;elf-evident. And yet the direct contrary is an evident fact, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> that we are con&s;cious of many things which are not pre&s;ent to the mind; that is, which are not, like impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, within the mind. Nor is there any manner of difficul|ty to conceive, that an impre&s;&s;ion may be made upon us, by an external object, in &s;uch a manner, as to rai&s;e a direct percepti|on of the external object it&s;elf. When we attend to the operations of the external &s;en&s;es, the impre&s;&s;ions made upon us by external objects, are di&s;covered to have very different effects. In &s;ome in&s;tances we feel the im|pre&s;&s;ion, and are con&s;cious of it, as an im|pre&s;&s;ion. In others, being quite uncon&s;ci|ous of the impre&s;&s;ion, we perceive only the external object. And to give full &s;atisfacti|on to the reader, upon the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, it may perhaps not be fruitle&s;s, briefly to run over the operations of the &s;everal exter|nal
<PB N="261" REF="265">
&s;en&s;es, by which the mind is made con|&s;cious of external objects, and of their pro|perties.</P>
<P>AND fir&s;t, with regard to the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling, which gives us no notice of ex|ternal exi&s;tences. Here the operation is of the &s;imple&s;t kind. It is no more but an impre&s;&s;ion made at the organ, which is per|ceived as an impre&s;&s;ion. Experience, 'tis true, and habit, lead us to a&s;cribe this parti|cular impre&s;&s;ion to &s;ome external thing as its cau&s;e. Thus, when a particular impre&s;&s;ion is made upon us, termed the &s;weet &s;mell of a ro&s;e, we learn to a&s;cribe it to a ro&s;e, tho' there is no &s;uch object within view, becau&s;e that peculiar impre&s;&s;ion upon the organ of &s;melling, is always found to accompany the &s;ight and touch of the body, called a ro&s;e. But that this connection is the child of ex|perience only, will be evident from the fol|lowing con&s;iderations; that, when a new &s;mell is perceived, we are utterly at a lo&s;s, what cau&s;e to a&s;cribe it to; and, that when a child feels a &s;mell, it is not led to a&s;&s;ign it
<PB N="262" REF="266">
to any cau&s;e whatever. In this ca&s;e, there can be no other difficulty, but to compre|hend, in what manner the mind becomes con&s;cious of an impre&s;&s;ion, made upon the body. Upon which, it &s;eems &s;ufficient to ob|&s;erve, that we are kept entirely ignorant, in what manner the &s;oul and body are connect|ed; which is no &s;ingular ca&s;e. But, from our ignorance of the manner of this connec|tion, to deny the reality of external exi&s;ten|ces, reducing all to a world of ideas, is in re|ality not le&s;s whim&s;ical, than if one, after admitting the reality of external exi&s;ten|ces, &s;hould go about to deny, that we have any perception of them; merely becau&s;e we cannot fully account for the manner of this perception, nor how a material &s;ub&s;tance can communicate it&s;elf to the mind, which is &s;pi|rit and not matter. The &s;ame ob&s;ervations may be applied to the &s;en&s;e of hearing; with this difference only, that a &s;ound is not per|ceived, at lea&s;t not originally, as an impre&s;&s;i|on made at the organ, but merely as an ex|i&s;tence in the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="267">
IN the &s;en&s;es of ta&s;ting and touching, we are con&s;cious not only of an impre&s;&s;ion made at the organ, but al&s;o of a body which makes the impre&s;&s;ion. When I lay my hand upon this table, the impre&s;&s;ion is of a hard &s;mooth body, which re&s;i&s;ts the moti|on of my hand. In this impre&s;&s;ion, there is nothing to create the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of fal|lacy. The body acts where it is, and it acts merely by re&s;i&s;tance. There occurs not, therefore, any other difficulty in this ca&s;e, than that mentioned above, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> after what manner an impre&s;&s;ion made at an organ of the body, is communicated to, or perceived by the mind. We &s;hall only add upon this head, that touch alone, which is the lea&s;t intricate of all our feelings, is &s;ufficient to overthrow the doctor's whole pompous &s;y&s;tem. We have, from that &s;en&s;e, the full|e&s;t and cleare&s;t perception of external ex|i&s;tences, that can be conceived, &s;ubject to no doubt, ambiguity, nor even cavil. And this perception, mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, &s;upport
<PB N="264" REF="268">
the authority of our &s;en&s;es, when they give us notice of external exi&s;tences.</P>
<P>WHAT remains to be examined, is the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing, which, 'tis pre&s;umed, the doctor had principally an eye to, in arguing again&s;t the reality of external exi&s;tences. And indeed, the operation of perceiving objects at a di&s;tance, is &s;o curious, and &s;o &s;ingular, that it is not &s;urpri&s;ing, a rigid philo&s;opher &s;hould be puzzled about it. In this ca&s;e, there is a difficulty, which applies with &s;ome &s;hew of &s;trength, and which po&s;&s;ibly has had weight with our author, tho' it is never once mentioned by him. It is, that no being can act but where it is, and that a body, at a di&s;tance, cannot act upon the mind, more than the mind upon it. I mu&s;t candidly own, that this argument appears to evince the nece&s;&s;ity, of &s;ome intermediate means, in the act of vi&s;ion. One means is &s;ugge&s;ted by matter of fact. The image of a vi&s;ible object, is painted upon the retina of the eye. And it is not more difficult to
<PB N="265" REF="269">
conceive, that this image may be &s;ome how conveyed to the mind, than to conceive the manner of its being painted upon the retina. This circum&s;tance puts the operation of vi|&s;ion, in one re&s;pect, upon the &s;ame footing, with that of touching; both being perform|ed by means of an impre&s;&s;ion made at the organ. There is indeed this e&s;&s;ential diffe|rence, that the impre&s;&s;ion of touch is felt as &s;uch, whereas the impre&s;&s;ion of &s;ight is not felt: we are not con&s;cious of any &s;uch im|pre&s;&s;ion, but merely of the object it&s;elf, which makes the impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>AND here a curious piece of mechani&s;m pre&s;ents it&s;elf to our view. Tho' an impre&s;|&s;ion is made upon the mind, by means of the image painted upon the retina, whereby the external object is perceived; yet nature has carefully concealed this impre&s;&s;ion from us, in order to remove all ambiguity, and to give us a di&s;tinct feeling of the object it&s;elf, and of that only. In touching and ta&s;ting, the impre&s;&s;ion made at the organ, is &s;o clo&s;e|ly
<PB N="266" REF="270">
connected with the body which makes the impre&s;&s;ion, that the perception of the impre&s;&s;ion, along with that of the body, cre|ates no confu&s;ion nor ambiguity, the body being felt as operating where it really is. But were the impre&s;&s;ion of a vi&s;ible object felt, as made at the retina, which is the organ of &s;ight, all objects behoved to be &s;een as with|in the eye. It is doubted among naturali&s;ts, whether outne&s;s or di&s;tance is at all di&s;cover|able by &s;ight, and whether that appearance be not the effect of experience. But bodies, and their operations, are &s;o clo&s;ely connected in place, that were we con&s;cious of an organic impre&s;&s;ion at the retina, the mind would have a con&s;tant propen&s;ity to place the body there al&s;o; which would be a circum&s;tance extremely perplexing, in the act of vi&s;ion, as &s;etting feeling and experience in perpetual oppo&s;ition; enough to poi&s;on all the plea|&s;ure we enjoy by that noble &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>FOR &s;o &s;hort-&s;ighted a creature as man, it is the wor&s;t rea&s;on in the world for denying
<PB N="267" REF="271">
any well atte&s;ted fact, that we cannot ac|count for the manner by which it is brought about. It is true, we cannot explain, after what manner it is, that, by the intervention of the rays of light, the beings, and things around us, are laid open to our view; but it is mere arrogance, to pretend to doubt of the fact, upon that account; for it is, in effect, maintaining, that there is nothing in nature, but what we can explain.</P>
<P>THE perception of objects at a di&s;tance, by intervention of the rays of light, in|volves no incon&s;i&s;tency nor impo&s;&s;ibility. And unle&s;s this could be a&s;&s;erted, we have no rea&s;on nor foundation to with-hold that a&s;&s;ent to a matter of fact, which is due to the authority of our &s;en&s;es. And after all, this particular &s;tep of the operation of vi&s;ion, is, at bottom, not more difficult to be conceiv|ed or accounted for, than the other &s;teps, of which no man entertains a doubt. It is, per|haps, not ea&s;y to explain, how the image of an external body is painted upon the <HI>retina tuni|ca.</HI>
<PB N="268" REF="272">
And no per&s;on pretends to explain, how this image is communicated to the mind. Why then &s;hould we he&s;itate about the la&s;t &s;tep, to wit the perception of external objects, more than about the two former, when they are all equally &s;upported, by the mo&s;t unexceptionable evidence. The whole operation of vi&s;ion far &s;urpa&s;&s;es human know|ledge: but not more, than the operation of magneti&s;m, electricity, and a thou&s;and other natural appearances; and our ignorance of the cau&s;e, ought not to make us &s;u&s;pect de|ceit in the one ca&s;e, more than in the other.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall conclude this &s;ubject, with the following reflection. Whether our percep|tion of the reality of external objects, corre|&s;ponds to the truth of things, or whether it be a mere illu&s;ion, is a que&s;tion, which, from the nature of the thing, cannot admit of a &s;trict demon&s;tration. One thing is certain, that, &s;uppo&s;ing the reality of external ob|jects, we can form no conception of their being di&s;played to us, in a more lively and
<PB N="269" REF="273">
convincing manner, than in fact is done. Why then call a thing in doubt, of which we have as good evidence, as human nature is capable of receiving? But we cannot call it in doubt, otherways than in &s;peculation, and even then, but for a moment. We have a thorough conviction of the reality of exter|nal objects; it ri&s;es to the highe&s;t certainty of belief; and we act, in con&s;equence of it, with the greate&s;t &s;ecurity of not being de|ceived. Nor are we in fact deceived. When we put the matter to a trial, every experi|ment an&s;wers to our perceptions, and con|firms us more and more in our belief.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY IV. <HI>Of our</HI> IDEA <HI>of</HI> POWER.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ubject propo&s;ed to be handled in the pre&s;ent e&s;&s;ay is the idea of <HI>power,</HI> and its origin. This term is found in all languages: we talk familiarly, of a power in one body, to produce certain effects, and of a capacity in another body, to have cer|tain effects produced upon it. Yet authors have differed &s;trangely, about the foundati|on of the&s;e ideas; and, after all that has been &s;aid, it &s;eems yet to be a matter of uncer|tainty, whether they are &s;ugge&s;ted by rea&s;on, by experience, or by what other means. This &s;ubject de&s;erves our attention the more, that the bulk of u&s;eful knowledge depends upon it. Without &s;ome in&s;ight into cau&s;es and their effects, we &s;hould be a very imper|fect race of beings. And, with regard to the pre&s;ent undertaking, this &s;ubject mu&s;t not, at any rate, be overlooked; becau&s;e from it, principally, is derived any know|ledge
<PB N="272" REF="275">
we have of the Deity, as will be after|wards made evident.</P>
<P>POWER denotes a &s;imple idea, which, upon that account, cannot admit of a defini|tion. But no per&s;on is, nor can be at a lo&s;s, about the meaning. Every action we perceive, gives us a notion of power; for a produc|tive cau&s;e is implied in our perception of e|very action or event <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay of liberty and nece&s;&s;ity.</NOTE>; and the very idea of cau&s;e comprehends a power of producing its effect. Let us only reflect upon the per|ception we have, when we &s;ee a &s;tone thrown into the air out of one's hand. In the per|ception of this action, are included, contigu|ity of the hand and &s;tone, the motion of the per&s;on's hand with the &s;tone in it, and the &s;eparate motion of the &s;tone, following the other circum&s;tances in point of time. The fir&s;t circum&s;tance is nece&s;&s;ary, to put the man in a condition to exert his power upon the &s;tone; the &s;econd is the actual exertion of the power; and the la&s;t is the effect produc|ed
<PB N="273" REF="276">
by that exertion. But the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces, which include both contiguity and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, make no part of the idea of power; which is conceived or felt as an inherent pro|perty &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the man, not merely when he is exerting it, but even when he is at re&s;t. That all men have this very idea, is a fact not to be controverted. The only doubt is, whence it is derived; from what &s;ource it &s;prings.</P>
<P>THAT rea&s;on cannot help us out, will be evident. For rea&s;on mu&s;t always have &s;ome object to employ it&s;elf upon. There mu&s;t be known <HI>Data</HI> or principles, to lead us to the di&s;covery of things, which are connected with the&s;e <HI>Data</HI> or principles. But with regard to power, which makes a nece&s;&s;ary connection betwixt a cau&s;e and its effect, we have no <HI>Data</HI> nor principles to lead us to the di&s;covery. We are not acquainted with the beings and things about us, otherways than by certain qualities and properties, obvious to the external &s;en|&s;es. Power is none of the&s;e; nor is there
<PB N="274" REF="277">
any connection which we can di&s;cover, be|twixt power and any of the&s;e. In a word, we have not the lea&s;t foundation for conclud|ing power in any body, till it once exert its power. If it be urged, that the effects pro|duced are <HI>Data,</HI> from which, we can infer a cau&s;e by a proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, and con|&s;equently, a power in the cau&s;e to produce the&s;e effects; I an&s;wer, that when a new thing or quality is produced, when in gene|ral any change is brought about, it is ex|tremely doubtful, whether, by any proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, we can conclude it to be an effect, &s;o as nece&s;&s;arily to require a cau&s;e of its exi&s;t|ence. That we do conclude it to be an ef|fect, is mo&s;t certain. But that we can draw any &s;uch conclu&s;ion, merely from rea&s;on, I don't clearly &s;ee. What leads me, I confe&s;s, to this way of thinking, is, that men of the greate&s;t genius have been un&s;ucce&s;sful, in at|tempting to prove, that every thing which be|gins to exi&s;t, mu&s;t have a cau&s;e of its exi&s;tence. <Q>Whatever is produced (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Locke)</HI> without any cau&s;e, is produced by <HI>nothing;</HI>
<PB N="275" REF="278">
or, in other words, has <HI>nothing</HI> for its cau&s;e. But <HI>nothing</HI> can never be a cau&s;e, no more than it can be <HI>&s;omething.</HI></Q> This is obviou&s;ly begging the que&s;tion. To af|firm that <HI>nothing</HI> is the cau&s;e, is taking for granted that a cau&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary; which is the very point undertaken to be made out. Doctor <HI>Clarke</HI>'s argument labours under the &s;ame defect. <Q>Every thing (he &s;ays) mu&s;t have a cau&s;e; for if any thing wanted a cau&s;e, it would produce it&s;elf; that is, exi&s;t before it exi&s;ted, which is impo&s;&s;ible.</Q> If a thing can exi&s;t without a cau&s;e, there is no nece&s;&s;ity it &s;hould produce it&s;elf, or that any thing &s;hould produce it. In &s;hort, there does not appear to me any contradiction in the above propo&s;ition, that a thing may begin to exi&s;t without a cau&s;e: and therefore, I dare not declare the fact to be impo&s;&s;ible. But &s;en&s;e and feeling afford me a conviction, that nothing begins to exi&s;t without a cau&s;e, tho' rea&s;on cannot afford me a demon&s;tration of it. This matter will be opened afterwards. At pre&s;ent, it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the
<PB N="276" REF="279">
conviction in this ca&s;e is complete, and car|ries &s;o much authority with it, as &s;carce to admit of a bare conception, that the thing can po&s;&s;ibly be otherways. This &s;ubject, at the &s;ame time, affords a new in&s;tance of what we have had more than once occa&s;ion to ob|&s;erve. Fond of arguments drawn from the nature of things, we are too apt to apply &s;uch arguments without di&s;cretion; and to call that demon&s;tration, which, at bottom, is no|thing but a conviction from &s;en&s;e and feel|ing. Our perceptions, which work &s;ilently, and without effort, are apt to be overlook|ed; and we vainly imagine, we can demon|&s;trate every propo&s;ition, which we perceive to be true.</P>
<P>IT will be pretty obvious, that the idea of power is not deducible from experience, more than from rea&s;on. We can learn no|thing merely from experience, but that two objects may have been con&s;tantly conjoined in time pa&s;t, &s;uch as fire and heat, the &s;un and light. But, in the fir&s;t place, all that
<PB N="277" REF="280">
can be gathered from &s;uch facts, comes far &s;hort of our idea of cau&s;e and effect, or of a power in one body to produce &s;ome change in another. In the &s;econd place, experience, which relates only to the actions of the par|ticular bodies we are acquainted with, can|not aid us to di&s;cover power in any body, that we have not formerly &s;een in action. Yet, from the very fir&s;t operation of &s;uch a body, we have the perception of cau&s;e and effect, which therefore cannot be from ex|perience. And, in the la&s;t place, as experi|ence in no ca&s;e reaches to futurity, our idea of power, did it depend upon experience, could only look backward: with regard to every new production, depending upon cau&s;|es even the mo&s;t familiar, we &s;hould be ut|terly at a lo&s;s to form any idea of power.</P>
<P>IT being now evident, that our idea of power is not derived, either from rea&s;on or experience, we &s;hall endeavour to trace out the true foundation of this idea. Running over the &s;ubject, the following thoughts oc|cur,
<PB N="278" REF="281">
which I &s;hall &s;et before the reader, in their natural order. As man, in his life and actions, is nece&s;&s;arily connected, both with the animate and inanimate world; he would be utterly at a lo&s;s to conduct him&s;elf, with|out &s;ome acquaintance with the beings a|round him, and their operations. His ex|ternal &s;en&s;es give him all the intelligence that is nece&s;&s;ary, not only for being, but for well|being. They di&s;cover to him, in the fir&s;t place, the exi&s;tence of external things. But this would not be &s;ufficient, unle&s;s they al&s;o di&s;covered to him their powers and operati|ons. The &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing is the principal means of his intelligence. I have explained, in a former e&s;&s;ay, that peculiar manner of perception, by which we di&s;cover the exi&s;t|ence of external objects. And when the&s;e are put in motion, whereby certain things follow, 'tis by another peculiar manner of perception, that we di&s;cover a relation be|twixt certain objects, which makes one be termed the cau&s;e, the other the effect. I need &s;carce repeat again, that there is no ex|plaining
<PB N="279" REF="282">
&s;imple feelings and perceptions, o|therways than by &s;ugge&s;ting the terms which denote them. All that can be done in this ca&s;e, is to reque&s;t of the reader, to attend to what pa&s;&s;es in his mind, when he &s;ees one billiard ball &s;truck again&s;t another, or a tree, which the wind is blowing down, or a &s;tone thrown into the air out of one's hand. We are obviou&s;ly &s;o con&s;tituted, as not only to perceive the one body acting, and exerting its power; but al&s;o to perceive, that the change in the other body is produced by <HI>means</HI> of that action or exertion of power. This change we perceive to be an <HI>effect;</HI> and we perceive a nece&s;&s;ary connection betwixt the action and the effect, &s;o as that the one mu&s;t unavoidably follow the other.</P>
<P>As I di&s;cover power in external objects, by the eye, &s;o I di&s;cover power in my mind, by an internal &s;en&s;e. By one act of the will ideas are rai&s;ed. By another act of the will, my limbs are put in motion. Attending to the&s;e operations, I perceive or feel the mo|tion
<PB N="280" REF="283">
of the limbs, and the entry of the ide|as, to follow nece&s;&s;arily from the act of the will. In other words, I perceive or feel the&s;e to be effects, and the act of the will to be the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>AND that this feeling is involved in the very perception of the action, without taking in either rea&s;on or experience, may be illu&s;|trated by &s;ome plain ob&s;ervations. There is no relation more familiar, even to children, than that of cau&s;e and effect. The fir&s;t time a child lifts a bit of bread, the perception it has of this action, not only includes a con|junction of the hand with the bread, and that the motion of the latter follows the motion of the former; but it likeways in|cludes that peculiar modification, which is expre&s;t by a power in the hand to lift the bread. Accordingly, we find no expre&s;&s;ion more familiar among infants and ru&s;ticks, nor better under&s;tood than I <HI>can</HI> do this, I <HI>can</HI> do that. Further, as things are be&s;t illu&s;trated by their contraries, let us put the ca&s;e of a
<PB N="281" REF="284">
being, if there is &s;uch a one, who, in view|ing external objects, has no idea of &s;ub&s;tance, but only of qualities; and who, in viewing motion, does not feel the change produced by it, to be an effect, or any way connected with the motion, further than as following it in point of time. It appears extremely e|vident, that this &s;uppo&s;ed being can never have the idea of body, or of its powers. Rea|&s;on or experience can never give it the idea of body or &s;ub&s;tance, and far le&s;s of their powers.</P>
<P>IT is very true, we cannot di&s;cover power in any object, as we di&s;cover the object it&s;elf, merely by intuition. But the moment an alte|ration is produced by any object, we perceive that the object has a power to produce that alteration; which leads to denominate the one a cau&s;e, and the other an effect. I don't a&s;&s;ert that we can never be in a mi&s;take about this matter. Children often err, by attri|buting an effect to one cau&s;e in&s;tead of ano|ther, or by con&s;idering that to be a cau&s;e,
<PB N="282" REF="285">
which is not. Mi&s;takes of this kind are cor|rected by experience. But they prove the reality of the perception of power, ju&s;t as much as where our perceptions are agree|able to the truth of things.</P>
<P>AND with regard to the fallibility of the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing, when it points out to us cau|&s;es and effects, the compari&s;on may be ju&s;t|ly in&s;tituted, betwixt it and belief. The fa|culty which regulates belief is not infallible. It &s;ometimes leads us into errors. Nei|ther is the faculty infallible, by which we di&s;cern one thing to be a cau&s;e, another to be an effect. Yet both are exerted with &s;ufficient certainty, to guide us through life, without many capital errors.</P>
<P>THE author of the treati&s;e of human na|ture, has employed a world of rea&s;oning, in &s;earching for the foundation of our idea of power and of nece&s;&s;ary connection. And, after all his anxious re&s;earches, he can make no more of it, but <Q>That the idea of ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="283" REF="286">
connection, <HI>alias power</HI> or <HI>energy,</HI> ari&s;es from a number of in&s;tances, of one thing always following another, which connects them in the imagination; where|by we can readily foretel the exi&s;tence of the one from the appearance of the o|ther.</Q> And he pronounces, <Q>That this connection can never be &s;ugge&s;ted from any one of the&s;e in&s;tances, &s;urveyed in all po&s;&s;ible lights and po&s;itions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philo&s;ophical e&s;&s;ays, e&s;&s;. 7.</NOTE>.</Q> Thus he places the e&s;&s;ence of nece&s;&s;ary connecti|on, or power, upon that propen&s;ity, which cu&s;tom produces, to pa&s;s from an object to the idea of its u&s;ual attendant. And from the&s;e premi&s;es, he draws a conclu&s;ion of a very extraordinary nature, and which he him|&s;elf acknowledges to be not a little paradox|ical. His words are: <Q>Upon the whole, nece&s;&s;ity is &s;omething that exi&s;ts in the mind, not in objects; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for us even to form the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of it, con&s;idered as a quality in bodies. The efficacy or energy in cau&s;es, is neither
<PB N="284" REF="287">
placed in the cau&s;es them&s;elves, nor in the Deity, nor in the concurrence of the&s;e two principles; but belongs entirely to the &s;oul, which con&s;iders the union of two or more objects in all pa&s;t in&s;tances. 'Tis here that the real power of cau&s;es is plac|ed, along with their connection and ne|ce&s;&s;ity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e of human nature, vol. 1. pag. 290, 291.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>HE may well admit this doctrine to be a violent paradox, becau&s;e, in reality, it con|tradicts our natural feelings, and wages war with the common &s;en&s;e of mankind. We cannot put this in a &s;tronger light than our author him&s;elf does, in forming an objecti|on again&s;t his own doctrine. <Q>What! the efficacy of cau&s;esly in the determination of the mind! as if cau&s;es did not operate en|tirely independent of the mind, and would not continue their operation, even tho' there was no mind exi&s;tent to contemplate them, or rea&s;on concerning them. This
<PB N="285" REF="288">
is to rever&s;e the order of nature, and to make that &s;econdary which is really pri|mary. To every operation there is a pow|er proportioned; and this power mu&s;t be placed on the body that operates. If we remove the power from one cau&s;e, we mu&s;t a&s;cribe it to another. But to remove it from all cau&s;es, and be&s;tow it on a being that is noways related to the cau&s;e, or effect, but by perceiving them, is a gro&s;s ab&s;urdi|ty, and contrary to the mo&s;t certain princi|ples of human rea&s;on <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pag. 294.</NOTE>.</Q> In &s;hort, no|thing is more clear, than that, from the ve|ry &s;ight of bodies in motion, we have the idea of power, which connects them toge|ther, in the relation of <HI>cau&s;e</HI> and <HI>effect.</HI> This power is perceived as a quality in the acting body, and by no means is an operation of the mind, or an ea&s;y tran&s;ition of thought from one object to another. And there|fore, flatly to deny our perception of &s;uch a quality in bodies, as our author does, is tak|ing upon him to contradict a plain matter of
<PB N="286" REF="289">
fact, of which all the word can give te&s;timo|ny. He may be at a lo&s;s, indeed, to di&s;cover the &s;ource of this perception, becau&s;e he can neither derive it, nor the idea of &s;ub&s;tance, from his own principles. But it has been more than once ob&s;erved, that it is too bold, to deny a fact, &s;upported by the be&s;t evi|dence, merely becau&s;e one is at a lo&s;s to di&s;|cover the cau&s;e. At the &s;ame time, there is no manner of difficulty to lay open the foundation of the&s;e perceptions. Both of them are impre&s;&s;ions of &s;ight, as is clearly made out above.</P>
<P>AND to &s;how, that our author's account of this matter comes far &s;hort of truth, it will be plain from one or two in&s;tances, that tho' a con&s;tant connection of two ob|jects, may, by habit or cu&s;tom, produce a &s;i|milar connection in the imagination; yet that a con&s;tant connection, whether in the imagination, or betwixt the objects them|&s;elves, does by no means come up to our idea of power. Far from it. In a gar|ri&s;on,
<PB N="287" REF="290">
the &s;oldiers con&s;tantly turn out at a certain beat of the drum. The gates of the town are opened and &s;hut regularly, as the clock points at a certain hour. The&s;e facts are ob&s;erved by a child, grow up with him, and turn habitual during a long life. In this in&s;tance, there is a con&s;tant connection be|twixt objects, which is attended with a &s;imi|lar connection in the imagination: yet the per&s;on above &s;uppo&s;ed, if not a changeling, never imagined, the beat of the drum to be the cau&s;e of the motion of the &s;oldiers; nor the pointing of the clock to a certain hour, to be the cau&s;e of the opening or &s;hutting of the gates. He perceives the cau&s;e of the&s;e o|perations to be very different; and is not led into any mi&s;take by the above circum&s;tances, however clo&s;ely connected. Let us put ano|ther in&s;tance &s;till more appo&s;ite. Such is the human con&s;titution, that we act nece&s;&s;arily, upon the exi&s;tence of certain perceptions or motives. The pro&s;pect of victuals makes a hungry man accelerate his pace. Re&s;pect to an antient family moves him to take a wife.
<PB N="288" REF="291">
An object of di&s;tre&s;s prompts him to lay out his money, or venture his per&s;on. Yet no man dreams a motive to be the cau&s;e of action; tho', if the doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity hold true, here is not only a con&s;tant, but a ne|ce&s;&s;ary connection <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A thought or idea, 'tis obvious, cannot be the cau&s;e of action; cannot, of it&s;elf, produce motion. After what manner then does it operate? I explain the matter thus: The power of magneti&s;m, or any other particular power in matter, by which the body endued with the power is im|pelled towards other bodies, cannot operate, if there is no other body placed within its &s;phere of activity. But placing another body there, the magnetic body is directly impelled towards this new body. Yet the new body is not the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of the motion, but only the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of it; the condition of the power being &s;uch, that the body endued with it cannot operate, but with relation to another body, within its &s;phere of action. Preci&s;ely, in the &s;ame manner, does the mind act, upon pre&s;enting of a thought or idea. The idea is not the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of the action, but only the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of it. It is the mind which exerts the action; only 'tis &s;o framed, that it cannot exert its powers, otherways than upon the pre&s;ent|ing of certain perceptions to it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM the in&s;tance la&s;t given, it appears, that con&s;tant connection, and the other cir|cum&s;tances mentioned by our author, are far from coming up to our idea of <HI>power.</HI>
<PB N="289" REF="292">
There may be even a nece&s;&s;ary connection betwixt two objects, without putting them in the relation of <HI>cau&s;e</HI> and <HI>effect,</HI> and with|out involving a power in the one to produce the other. Our author, then, attempts ra|ther too bold an enterprize, when he un|dertakes to argue mankind out of their &s;en|&s;es and feelings. That we have &s;uch a feel|ing of power, as is above de&s;cribed, is a fact that cannot admit of the &s;malle&s;t controver|&s;y. And all that is left him, would he ar|gue with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, is to que&s;|tion, whether this feeling does, in fact, cor|re&s;pond to the truth of things. But he will not undertake &s;o &s;tubborn a task, as to prove this a delu&s;ive feeling; when he mu&s;t be &s;en|&s;ible of the wonderful harmony, that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts betwixt it and the reality of cau&s;es and their effects. We have no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect deceit in this ca&s;e, more than with regard to many other &s;en&s;es, &s;ome of which remain to be unfolded, that are wrought into the con&s;ti|tution of man, for wi&s;e and good purpo&s;es,
<PB N="290" REF="293">
and without which, he would be a very ir|regular and defective being.</P>
<P>AND were it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay more upon a &s;ubject, which indeed merits the utmo&s;t attention; we have, if I mi&s;take not, this author's own evidence for us; which I con&s;ider as no mean evidence in any ca&s;e; and which mu&s;t be held of the greate&s;t au|thority, when given again&s;t him&s;elf. And this evidence he gives in his philo&s;ophical e&s;|&s;ays. For tho', in this work, he continues to maintain <Q>That nece&s;&s;ity exi&s;ts only in the mind, not in objects, and that it is not po&s;&s;ible for us even to form the mo&s;t di|&s;tant idea of it, con&s;idered as a quality in bodies;</Q> yet, in the cour&s;e of the argu|ment, he more than once di&s;covers, that he him&s;elf is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an idea of <HI>power,</HI> con|&s;idered as a quality in bodies, tho' he has not attended to it. Thus he ob&s;erves <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">London edition, pag. 58.</NOTE>, <Q>That nature conceals from us, tho&s;e pow|ers and principles, on which the influ|ence
<PB N="291" REF="294">
of objects entirely depends.</Q> And of the&s;e powers and principles, he gives &s;eve|ral apt in&s;tances, &s;uch as a power or quality in bread to nouri&s;h; a power by which bo|dies per&s;evere in motion. This is not only owning an idea of power as a quality in bo|dies, but al&s;o owning the reality of this power.

it infallibly produces the other, and operates with the greate&s;t certainty and &s;tronge&s;t nece&s;&s;ity.</Q> No ma&s;ter of language can give a de&s;cription of power, con&s;idered as a qua|lity in bodies, in more apt or more expre&s;|&s;ive terms.

<P>IF the foregoing arguments have not pre|vailed, may not the following argument hope for &s;ucce&s;s? Figure the &s;imple&s;t of all ca&s;es; a man ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, to walk through the room; and try to analy&s;e the perception of this &s;imple event. In the fir&s;t place, is the man active or pa&s;&s;ive? Is he moved, or does he move him&s;elf? No mor|tal is at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand the&s;e que&s;tions; and no mortal is at a lo&s;s to an&s;wer them. We have a di&s;tinct perception or feeling, that the man is not moved, but moves; or, which is the &s;ame, moves him&s;elf. Let us exa|mine, in the next place, what is involved in the perception or feeling we have, when we

&s;ee this man walking. Do we not &s;ay fami|liarly, does not a child &s;ay, that he <HI>can</HI> walk? And what other thing do we mean by this expre&s;&s;ion, than that he has a <HI>power</HI> to walk? Does not the very idea of walking include in it a power to walk? In this in&s;tance, our author, unhappily for his argument, has nei|ther contiguity nor &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to recur to, for explaining his idea of power, imperfect as it is. And therefore, with regard to this in&s;tance, he mu&s;t either admit, that we have an idea of power, con&s;idered as a quality in objects, or take upon him to deny, that we have any idea of power at all: for it is evi|dent, that the idea of power, when it com|prehends only a &s;ingle object, can never be re&s;olved into a connection in the imaginati|on, betwixt two or more objects. We have thus the feeling of power from every action, be it of the &s;imple&s;t kind that can be figur|ed. And having once acquired the idea of power exerted by an animal, to put it&s;elf in motion, we readily transfer that idea to the actions of bodies, animate and inanimate, up|on
<PB N="294" REF="297">
each other. And, after all, with due re|gard to an author of very acute parts, I cannot help ob&s;erving, that there is, per|haps, not one idea of all the train, which is more familiar to us, or more univer&s;al, than the idea of power.</P>
<P>HAVING thus a&s;certained the reality of our idea of power, as a quality in bodies, and traced it to its proper &s;ource, I &s;hall clo&s;e this e&s;&s;ay with &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon cau&s;|es and their effects. That we cannot di&s;co|ver power in any object, otherways than by &s;eeing it exert its power, is above ob&s;erved. Therefore, we can never di&s;cover any ob|ject to be a cau&s;e, otherways than by the effect produced. But with regard to things cau&s;ed or produced, the ca&s;e is very diffe|rent. For we can di&s;cover an object to be an effect, after the cau&s;e is removed, or when it is not at all &s;een. For in&s;tance, no one is at a lo&s;s to &s;ay, that a table or a chair is an effect produced. A child will ask, who made it? We perceive every event, every
<PB N="295" REF="298">
new object, to be an effect or production, the very conception of which involves the idea of a cau&s;e. Hence the maxim, <Q>That nothing can fall out, nothing begin to exi&s;t, without a cau&s;e;</Q> in other words, <Q>That every thing which begins to exi&s;t mu&s;t have a cau&s;e:</Q> a maxim univer&s;ally recogni&s;ed, and admitted by all mankind as &s;elf-evident. Nor can this be attributed to experience. The feel|ing is original, regarding &s;ingular objects and events, the cau&s;es of which are utterly unknown, not le&s;s than objects and events, which depend upon familiar cau&s;es. Chil|dren and ru&s;ticks are con&s;cious of this feel|ing, equally with tho&s;e who have the mo&s;t con&s;ummate experience of nature, and its operations <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the e&s;&s;ay upon liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, pag. 88.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FURTHER, the perception we have of a|ny object, as an effect, includes in it the feel|ing of a cau&s;e proportioned to the effect. If the object be an effect properly adapted to &s;ome end, the perception of it nece&s;&s;arily in|cludes
<PB N="296" REF="299">
an intelligent de&s;igning cau&s;e. If the effect be &s;ome good end brought about by proper means, the perception nece&s;&s;arily in|cludes a de&s;igning and benevolent cau&s;e. Nor is it in our power, by any &s;ort of con|&s;traint, to vary the&s;e feelings, or to give them a different modification from what they have by nature. It may be in our power to conceive, but it is not in our power to believe, that a fine piece of painting, a well wrote poem, or a beautiful piece of architecture, can ever be the effect of chance, or of blind fatality. The &s;uppo&s;ition, indeed, &s;o far as we can di&s;cover, does not involve any incon|&s;i&s;tency in the nature of things. It may be po&s;&s;ible, for any rea&s;on we have to the con|trary, that a blind and unde&s;igning cau&s;e may be productive of excellent effects. But our &s;en&s;es di&s;cover, what rea&s;on does not, that every object, which appears beautiful as adapted to an end or purpo&s;e, is the effect of a de&s;igning cau&s;e; and that every object, which appears beautiful as fitted to a good end or purpo&s;e, is the effect of a de&s;igning

cau&s;e; and that every object, which ap|pears beautiful as fitted to a good end or purpo&s;e, is the effect of a de&s;igning and benevolent cau&s;e. We are &s;o con&s;tituted, that we can entertain no doubt of this, if we would. And, &s;o far as we gather from experience, we are not deceiv'd.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY V. <HI>Of our</HI> KNOWLEDGE <HI>of</HI> FUTURE EVENTS.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE we are tied to this globe, &s;ome knowledge of the beings around us, and of their operations, is nece&s;&s;ary; becau&s;e, without it, we &s;hould be utterly at a lo&s;s how to conduct our&s;elves. This &s;ub|ject is handled in two former e&s;&s;ays. But were our knowledge limited to this &s;ubject, it would not be &s;ufficient for our well-be|ing, and &s;carce for our pre&s;ervation. It is likeways nece&s;&s;ary, that we have &s;ome know|ledge of future events; for about the&s;e we are mo&s;tly employed. A man will not &s;ow, if he has not a pro&s;pect of reaping: he will not build a hou&s;e, if he has not &s;ome &s;ecuri|ty, that it will &s;tand firm for years. Man is po&s;&s;e&s;t of this valuable branch of know|ledge: he can foretel future events. There is no doubt of the fact. The difficulty on|ly is, what are the means employed in mak|ing
<PB N="300" REF="302">
the di&s;covery. It is, indeed, an e&s;tabli&s;h|ed maxim, that the cour&s;e of nature con|tinues uniformly the &s;ame; and that things will be as they have been. But, from what premi&s;es we draw this conclu&s;ion, is not ob|vious. Uniformity in the operations of na|ture, with regard to time pa&s;t, is di&s;covered by experience. But of future time, having no experience, the maxim a&s;&s;uredly cannot be derived from that &s;ource. Neither will rea&s;on help us out. It is true, the produc|tion of one thing by another, even in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, implies a power; and this power is nece&s;&s;arily connected with its effect. But as power is an internal property, not di&s;cov|erable but by the effects produced, we can never, by any chain of rea&s;oning, conclude, power to be in any body, except in the in|&s;tant of operation. The power, for ought we know, may be at an end from that very in&s;tant. We cannot &s;o much as conclude, from any deduction of rea&s;on, that this earth, the &s;un, or any one being, will exi&s;t to-morrow. And, &s;uppo&s;ing their future ex|i&s;tence
<PB N="301" REF="303">
to be di&s;coverable by rea&s;on, we are not &s;o much acquainted with the nature or e&s;&s;ence of any one thing, as to di&s;cover a nece&s;&s;ary connection betwixt it and its pow|ers, that the one &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, the other mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ub&s;i&s;t. There is nothing &s;o ea&s;y to con|ceive, as that the mo&s;t active being, &s;hall at at once be deprived of all its activity: and a thing that may be conceived, can never be proved incon&s;i&s;tent or impo&s;&s;ible. An ap|peal to pa&s;t experience, will not carry us through. The &s;un has afforded us light and heat from the beginning of the world. But what rea&s;on have we to conclude, that its power of giving light and heat mu&s;t conti|nue; when it is as ea&s;y to conceive powers to be limited in point of time, as to con|ceive them perpetual? If to help us our here, we have recour&s;e to the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of a Supreme Being, as e&s;tabli&s;hing permanent general laws; the difficulty is, that we have no <HI>Data,</HI> from whence to conclude, in the way of rea&s;oning, that the&s;e general laws mu&s;t continue invariably the
<PB N="302" REF="304">
&s;ame without end. It is true, the conclu&s;i|on is actually made, but it mu&s;t be referred to &s;ome other &s;ource. For rea&s;oning will not aid us, more than experience does, to draw any one conclu&s;ion, from pa&s;t to fu|ture events. It is certain, at the &s;ame time, that the uniformity of nature's operations, is a maxim admitted by all mankind. Tho' altogether una&s;&s;i&s;ted either by rea&s;on or ex|perience, we never have the lea&s;t he&s;itation to conclude, that things will be as they have been; in &s;o much that we tru&s;t our lives and fortunes upon this conclu&s;ion. I &s;hall endeavour to trace out the principle, upon which this important conclu&s;ion is founded. And this &s;ubject will afford, 'tis hoped, a fre&s;h in&s;tance of the admirable corre&s;pond|ence, which is di&s;covered betwixt the nature of man, and his external circum&s;tances. What is already made out, will lead us directly to our point. If our conviction of the unifor|mity of nature, is not founded upon rea&s;on nor experience, it can have no other foun|dation but &s;en&s;e and feeling. The fact tru|ly
<PB N="303" REF="305">
is, that we are &s;o con&s;tituted, as, by a ne|ce&s;&s;ary determination of nature, to transfer our pa&s;t experience to futurity, and to have a direct perception or feeling of the con&s;tan|cy and uniformity of nature. This percep|tion or feeling mu&s;t belong to an internal &s;en&s;e, becau&s;e it evidently has no relation to any of our external &s;en&s;es. And an argument, which has been more than once &s;tated in the foregoing e&s;&s;ays, will be found deci&s;ive up|on this point. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a being, which has no perception or notion of the unifor|mity of nature: &s;uch a being will never be able to transfer its pa&s;t experience to futuri|ty. Every event, however conformable to pa&s;t experience, will come equally unexpect|ed to this being, as new and rare events do to us; tho' po&s;&s;ibly without the &s;ame &s;ur|pri&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS &s;en&s;e of con&s;tancy and uniformity in the works of nature, is not confined to the &s;ubject above handled, but di&s;plays it|&s;elf, remarkably, upon many other objects.
<PB N="304" REF="306">
We have a conviction of a common nature in beings, which are &s;imilar in their appear|ances. We expect a likene&s;s in their con&s;ti|tuent parts, in their appetites, and in their conduct. We not only lay our account with uniformity of behaviour, in the &s;ame indivi|dual, but in all the individuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies. This principle has &s;uch influence, as even to make us hope for con&s;tancy and uniformity, where experience would lead us to the oppo&s;ite conclu&s;ion. The rich man never thinks of poverty, nor the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed of relief. Even in this variable climate, we cannot readily bring our&s;elves to believe, that good or bad weather will have an end. Nay, it governs our notions in law-matters, and is the foundation of the maxim, <Q>That alteration or change of circum&s;tances is not to be pre&s;umed.</Q> Influenced by the &s;ame principle, every man acquires a certain uniformity of manner, which &s;preads it&s;elf upon his thoughts, words and actions. In our younger years, the effect of this princi|ple is le&s;s remarkable, being oppo&s;ed by a
<PB N="305" REF="307">
variety of pa&s;&s;ions, which, as they have dif|ferent, and &s;ometimes oppo&s;ite tendencies, occa&s;ion a fluctuation in our conduct. But, &s;o &s;oon as the heat of youth is over, this principle, acting without counter-balance, &s;eldom fails to bring on a punctual regulari|ty in our way of living, which is extremely remarkable in mo&s;t old people.</P>
<P>ANALOGY is one of the mo&s;t common &s;ources of rea&s;oning; the force of which is univer&s;ally admitted. The conviction of e|very argument founded on analogy, ari&s;es from this very &s;en&s;e of uniformity. Things &s;imilar, in &s;ome particulars, are pre&s;umed to be &s;imilar in every particular.</P>
<P>IN a word, as the bulk of our views and actions have a future aim, &s;ome knowledge of future events is nece&s;&s;ary, that we may a|dapt our views and actions to natural events. To this end, the Author of our nature has done two things. He has e&s;tabli&s;hed a con|&s;tancy and uniformity in the operations of

<HEAD>ESSAY VI. <HI>Of our</HI> DREAD <HI>of</HI> SUPERNATURAL POWERS <HI>in the</HI> DARK.</HEAD>
<P>A VERY &s;light view of human nature is &s;ufficient to convince us, that we were not dropt here by accident. This earth is fitted for man, and man is fitted for inhabit|ing this earth. By means of in&s;tinctive fa|culties, we have an intuitive knowledge of the things that &s;urround us; at lea&s;t of &s;uch things by which we may be affected. We can di&s;cover objects at a di&s;tance. We di&s;cern them in their connection of cau&s;e and effect; and their future operations are laid open, as well as their pre&s;ent. But in this grand ap|paratus of in&s;tinctive faculties, by which the &s;ecrets of nature are di&s;clo&s;ed to us, one fa|culty &s;eems to be with-held; tho' in appear|ance the mo&s;t u&s;eful of all; and that is, a faculty to di&s;cern, what things are noxious, and what are friendly. The mo&s;t poi&s;on|ous fruits have &s;ometimes the faire&s;t colours;
<PB N="308" REF="310">
and the &s;avage animals partake of beauty with the tame and harmle&s;s. And when other particulars are inquir'd into, it will be found, by induction, that man has no origi|nal feeling of what is &s;alutary to him, and what is hurtful.</P>
<P>IT is natural to inquire why this in&s;tinct is with-held, when it appears to be the de|&s;ign of nature, to furni&s;h us plentifully with in&s;tincts, for the di&s;covery of u&s;eful truths. With regard to this matter, it is too bold an undertaking for man to dive into all the &s;ecrets of his maker. We ought to re&s;t contented with the numerous in&s;tances we have of good order and good purpo&s;e, which mu&s;t afford us a rational conviction, that good or|der and good purpo&s;e take place univer&s;al|ly. At the &s;ame time, a rational account may be &s;ugge&s;ted of this matter. We have a conviction, that there is nothing redun|dant or &s;uperfluous in the operations of na|ture. Different means are never afforded us to bring about the &s;ame end. Experience,
<PB N="309" REF="311">
&s;o far as it can go, is given us for acquiring knowledge; and in&s;tinct only, where expe|rience cannot aid us. 'Tis true, in&s;tinct is a more compendious way of di&s;covering u&s;e|ful truths. But man was intended an active being, and therefore left to his own indu&s;try, as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>MAN then is placed in this world, amid&s;t a great variety of objects, the nature and ten|dency of which are unknown to him, other|ways than by experience. In this &s;ituation, he would be in perpetual danger, had he not &s;ome faithful monitor, to keep him con&s;tant|ly upon the watch again&s;t harm. This mo|nitor is the propen&s;ity he has to be afraid of new objects; &s;uch e&s;pecially which have no peculiar beauty to rai&s;e his de&s;ire. A child, to whom all nature is &s;trange, dreads the ap|proach of every object; and even the face of man is frightful to it. The &s;ame timidity and &s;u&s;picion may be ob&s;erved in travellers, who conver&s;e with &s;trangers, and meet with unknown appearances. Upon the fir&s;t &s;ight of
<PB N="310" REF="312">
an herb or fruit, we apprehend the wor&s;t, and &s;u&s;pect it to be noxious. An unknown ani|mal is immediately conceived to be dange|rous. The more rare phaenomena of na|ture, the cau&s;es of which are unknown to the vulgar, never fail to &s;trike them with terror. From this induction, it is clear, that we dread unknown objects. They are al|ways &s;urveyed with an emotion of fear, 'till experience di&s;covers them to be harmle&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS dread of unknown objects, is &s;up|po&s;ed to enter into the con&s;titution of all &s;en|&s;itive beings, but is mo&s;t remarkable in the weak and defencele&s;s. The more feeble and delicate the creature is, the more &s;hy and ti|morous it is ob&s;erved to be. No creature is, by nature, more feeble and delicate than man; and this principle is to him of admir|able u&s;e, to keep him con&s;tantly upon his guard, and to balance the principle of curi|o&s;ity, which is prevalent in man above all o|ther creatures, and which, left to it&s;elf, would often betray him into fatal accidents.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="313">
THE dread of unknown objects is apt to fire the imagination, &s;o as to magnify their &s;uppo&s;ed evil qualities and tendencies. For it is a well known truth, that pa&s;&s;ion has a wonderful effect upon the imagination. The le&s;s we know of a new object, the greater li|berty we take, to dre&s;s it up in frightful co|lours. The object is forthwith conceived to have all tho&s;e dreadful qualities, which are &s;ugge&s;ted by the imagination; and the &s;ame terror is rai&s;ed, as if tho&s;e qualities were real and not imaginary <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See e&s;&s;ay upon belief.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AGAIN, where the new and unknown objects have any thing dreadful in appear|ance, this circum&s;tance, joined with our na|tural propen&s;ity to dread unknown objects, will rai&s;e terror even in the mo&s;t re&s;olute. If the evils, dreaded from &s;uch objects, are known neither in quality nor degree; the i|magination, being under no re&s;traint, figures the greate&s;t evils, both in kind and magni|tude, that can be conceived. Where no im|mediate harm en&s;ues, the mind, by the im|pul&s;e
<PB N="312" REF="314">
it has received, tran&s;ports it&s;elf into fu|turity, and imagines the &s;trange forms to be pre&s;ages of direful calamities. Hence it is, that the uncommon phaenomena of nature, &s;uch as comets, eclip&s;es, earthquakes, and the like, are, by the vulgar, held as forerun|ners of uncommon events. Grand objects make a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind, and give force to that pa&s;&s;ion which occupies it at the time. The above appearances being un|common, if not altogether new, di&s;po&s;e the mind to terror; which, aided by the emotion ari&s;ing from the grandeur of the objects, produces great agitation, and a violent appre|hen&s;ion of danger.</P>
<P>THE &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t familiar in&s;tance of our natural propen&s;ity to dread unknown objects, is the fear that &s;eizes many young per&s;ons in the dark; which is a phaenomenon that has not been accounted for, with any de|gree of &s;atisfaction. Light di&s;po&s;es the mind to chearfulne&s;s and courage. Darkne&s;s, on the contrary, depre&s;&s;es the mind, and di&s;po&s;es
<PB N="313" REF="315">
it to fear. Any object alarms the mind, when it is already prepared by darkne&s;s, to receive impre&s;&s;ions of fear. The object, which, in the dark, is &s;een but ob&s;curely, leaves the heated imagination at full liberty, to be&s;tow upon it the mo&s;t dreadful appearance. This phantom of the imagination, conceived as a reality, unhinges the mind, and throws it into a fit of di&s;traction. The imagination, now heated to the highe&s;t degree, multiplies the dreadful appearances to the utmo&s;t bounds of its conception. The object be|comes a &s;pectre, a devil, a hobgoblin, &s;ome|thing more terrible than ever was &s;een or de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>A VERY few accidents of this kind, having &s;o powerful an effect, are &s;ufficient to intro|duce an a&s;&s;ociation between darkne&s;s and malignant powers. And when once this a&s;&s;o|ciation is formed, there is no occa&s;ion for the appearance of an object to create terror. Frightful ideas croud into the mind, and aug|ment the fear, which is occa&s;ioned by dark|ne&s;s. The imagination becomes ungovern|able,
<PB N="314" REF="316">
and converts the&s;e ideas into real ap|pearances.</P>
<P>THAT the terror occa&s;ioned by darkne&s;s, is entirely owing to the operations of the i|magination, will be evident from a &s;ingle re|flection, that in company no &s;uch effect is produced. A companion can afford no &s;e|curity again&s;t &s;upernatural powers. But a companion has the &s;ame effect with &s;un|&s;hine, to chear the mind, and pre&s;erve it from gloomine&s;s and de&s;pondency.

This thought always returned upon me, and gave me pain. If there really exi&s;ts a being, who made, and who governs the world; and, if it be his purpo&s;e to di&s;|play him&s;elf to his rational creatures; it is

<P>IF the&s;e ab&s;tru&s;e arguments, however, are reli&s;hed by the learned and &s;peculative, 'tis &s;o far well. I cannot help acknowledging, that they afford me no conviction, at lea&s;t,
<PB N="317" REF="319">
no &s;olid and permanent conviction. We know little about the nature of things, but what we learn from a &s;trict attention to our own nature. That nothing can begin to exi&s;t without a cau&s;e, is &s;ufficiently evident from &s;en&s;e and feeling <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the e&s;&s;ay of our idea of power, towards the clo&s;e,</NOTE>. But that this can be demon&s;trated by any argument <HI>a priori,</HI> drawn from the nature of things, I have not ob&s;erved <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the &s;ame e&s;&s;ay at the beginning.</NOTE>. And if demon&s;tration fail us in the very out&s;etting, we cannot hope for its a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the after &s;teps. If any one being can begin to exi&s;t without a cau&s;e, e|very being may; upon which &s;uppo&s;ition, we never can hope for a demon&s;tration, that any one being mu&s;t be eternal. But, if this difficulty &s;hall be &s;urmounted, we have ano|ther to &s;truggle with. Admitting that &s;ome|thing has exi&s;ted from all eternity, I find no <HI>Data</HI> to determine <HI>a priori,</HI> whether this world has exi&s;ted of it&s;elf from all eternity, in a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cau&s;es and ef|fects; or whether it be an effect produced
<PB N="318" REF="320">
by an Almighty Power. It is indeed hard to conceive a world eternal and &s;elf-exi&s;tent, where all things are carried on by blind fate, without de&s;ign or intelligence. And yet I can find no demon&s;tration to the contrary. If we can form any ob&s;cure notion of one intelligent being, exi&s;ting from all eternity, it appears not more difficult to form a notion of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of beings, with or without intelligence; or a notion of a perpetual &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of cau&s;es and effects.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, difficulties pre&s;s both ways. But, the&s;e difficulties, when examined, do not a|ri&s;e from any incon&s;i&s;tency in our ideas. They are occa&s;ioned, merely, by the limit|ed capacity of the mind of man. We can|not comprehend an eternity of exi&s;tence. It is too bulky an object. It eludes our gra&s;p. The mind is like the eye. It can|not take in an object that is very great or very little. This, plainly is the &s;ource of our difficulties, when we attempt &s;peculati|ons &s;o remote from common apprehen&s;ion. Ab&s;tract rea&s;oning upon &s;uch a &s;ubject, mu&s;t
<PB N="319" REF="321">
lead into endle&s;s perplexities. It is indeed le&s;s difficult to conceive one eternal un|changeable being who made the world, than to conceive a blind chain of cau&s;es and ef|fects. At lea&s;t, we are di&s;po&s;ed to the for|mer, as being more agreeable to the imagi|nation. But as we cannot find any incon|&s;i&s;tency in the latter &s;uppo&s;ition, we cannot ju&s;tly &s;ay that it is demon&s;trably fal&s;e.</P>
<P>GIVE me leave to add, that to bring out &s;uch ab&s;tru&s;e and intricate &s;peculations into any clear and per&s;ua&s;ive light, is at any rate &s;carce to be expected. And if, after the utmo&s;t &s;training, they remain ob&s;cure and unaffecting, it is evident to me, that they mu&s;t have a bad tendency. Per&s;ons of a peevi&s;h and gloomy ca&s;t of mind, finding no conviction from that quarter, will be for|ti&s;ied in their propen&s;ity to believe that all things happen by blind chance; that there is no wi&s;dom, order or harmony in the go|vernment of this world; and con&s;equently that there is no God.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="322">
BEING therefore little &s;ollicitous about ar|guments <HI>a priori,</HI> for the exi&s;tence of a Deity, which are not proportioned to the capacity of man, I apply my&s;elf with zeal and chear|fulne&s;s, to &s;earch for the Deity in his works; for by the&s;e we mu&s;t di&s;cover him, if he has thought proper to make him&s;elf known. And the better to manage the inquiry, I &s;hall endeavour to make out three propo&s;i|tions; <HI>1&s;t,</HI> That if there is a being who is the maker and governor of the world, it is agreeable to any notions we can form of his government, that he &s;hould make &s;ome di&s;|covery of him&s;elf to his intelligent creatures. <HI>2dly,</HI> That in fact he has done &s;o. And <HI>3dly,</HI> That he has done &s;o in a manner a|greeable to the nature of man, and analo|gous to his other operations.</P>
<P>THERE certainly cannot be a more di&s;|couraging thought to man, than that the world was formed by a fortuitous concour&s;e of atoms, and that all things are carried on by blind impul&s;e. Upon that &s;uppo&s;ition,
<PB N="321" REF="323">
he can have no &s;ecurity for his life; nor for his continuing to be a moral agent and an intelligent creature, even for a moment. Things have been carried on with regularity and order. But chance may, in an in&s;tant, throw all things into the mo&s;t horrid and di&s;mal confu&s;ion. We can have no &s;olid com|fort in virtue, when it is a work of mere chance; nor can we ju&s;tify our reliance up|on the faith of others, when the nature of man re&s;ts upon &s;o precarious a foundation. Every thing mu&s;t appear gloomy, di&s;mal and disjointed, without a Deity to unite this world of beings into one beautiful and har|monious &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e con&s;iderations, and many more that will occur upon the fir&s;t re|flection, afford a very &s;trong conviction, if there is a wi&s;e and good Being, who &s;uper|intends the affairs of this world, that he will not conceal him&s;elf from his rational crea|tures. Can any thing be more de&s;irable, or more &s;ub&s;tantially u&s;eful, than to know, that there is a Being from whom no &s;ecrets are hid, to whom our good works are acceptable,
<PB N="322" REF="324">
and even the good purpo&s;es of our hearts; and who&s;e government, directed by wi&s;dom and benevolence, ought to make us re&s;t &s;e|cure, that nothing does or will fall out, but according to good order? This &s;entiment, rooted in the mind, is an antidote to all misfortune. Without it, life is at be&s;t but a confu&s;ed and gloomy &s;cene.</P>
<P>AND this leads to a different con&s;iderati|on, which makes our knowledge of a bene|volent Deity of the greate&s;t importance to us. Tho' natural and moral evil are far from prevailing in this world, yet &s;o much of both is &s;cattered over the face of things, as to create &s;ome degree of doubt, whether there may not be a mixture of chance, or of ill-will, in the government of this world. But, once &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;uperintendency of a good being, the&s;e evils are no longer con&s;idered as &s;uch. A man re&s;trains him&s;elf from un|lawful plea&s;ures, tho' the re&s;traint gives him pain. But then he does not con&s;ider this pain, as an evil to repine at. He &s;ubmits to
<PB N="323" REF="325">
it voluntarily and with &s;atisfaction, as one does to grief for the lo&s;s of a friend; being con&s;cious that it is <HI>right</HI> and <HI>fit</HI> for him to be &s;o affected. In the &s;ame manner, he &s;ub|mits to all the evils of this life. Having con|fidence in the good government of the De|ity, he is per&s;uaded that every thing hap|pens for the be&s;t, and therefore that it is his duty to &s;ubmit to whatever happens. This unfolds a &s;cene &s;o enlivening, and &s;o productive of chearfulne&s;s and good hu|mour, that we cannot readily think, if there is a benevolent Deity, that he will with-hold from his creatures &s;o invaluable a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>MAN, at the &s;ame time, by his ta&s;te for beauty, regularity and order, is fitted for contemplating the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s di&s;|played in the frame and government of this world. The&s;e are proper objects of ad|miration and joy. It is not agreeable to the ordinary cour&s;e of nature, that man &s;hould be endowed with an affection, with|out having a proper object to be&s;tow it up|on.
<PB N="324" REF="326">
And as the providence of the Deity is the highe&s;t object of this affection, it would be unnatural, that he &s;hould be kept in ig|norance of it.</P>
<P>THESE, I admit, are but probable rea&s;ons for believing, that, if there is a benevolent Deity, it mu&s;t be his intention to manife&s;t him&s;elf to his creatures: but they carry a ve|ry high degree of probability, which leaves little room for doubt. At the &s;ame time, tho' it &s;hould be our fate, to &s;earch in vain for this object of our affection, we ought not however to de&s;pair, and, in that de&s;pair, to conclude there is no God. Let us but re|flect, that he has not manife&s;ted him&s;elf to all his creatures. The brutes apparently know nothing of him. And &s;hould we be di&s;appointed in this &s;earch, the wor&s;t we can conclude, is, that for good and wi&s;e purpo&s;|es, which we cannot dive into, he has thought proper to with-hold him&s;elf al&s;o from us. We certainly have no rea&s;on to convert our ignorance into an argument
<PB N="325" REF="327">
again&s;t his exi&s;tence. Our ignorance brings us only a &s;tep lower, and puts us, &s;o far, up|on a footing with the brute creation.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd and important branch of our di&s;qui&s;ition, is, to a&s;certain this fact, that there is a Deity, and that he has manife&s;ted him&s;elf to us. I reque&s;t only attention of my reader, and not any unrea&s;onable con|ce&s;&s;ion. In a former e&s;&s;ay <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of our idea of power.</NOTE>, two propo&s;itions are made out. The fir&s;t is, that every thing which has a beginning, is perceived as a <HI>pro|duction</HI> or <HI>effect,</HI> which nece&s;&s;arily involves the idea of a <HI>cau&s;e.</HI> The &s;econd, that we nece&s;&s;arily transfer to the cau&s;e, whatever of contrivance or de&s;ign is di&s;covered in the ef|fect. Con&s;idering a hou&s;e, garden, picture or &s;tatue in it&s;elf, it is perceived as beauti|ful. If we attend to the&s;e objects in a diffe|rent view, as things having a beginning, we perceive them to be effects, involving the i|dea of a cau&s;e. If again we con&s;ider them as artfully contrived to an&s;wer certain pur|po&s;es, we perceive them to be the workman|&s;hip
<PB N="326" REF="328">
of &s;ome per&s;on of skill. Nor are we deceived in the&s;e perceptions. Upon exami|nation, we find, that they corre&s;pond to truth and reality.</P>
<P>BUT not only are the&s;e objects perceived as effects, which we afterwards learn, from experience, to be the production of man. Natural objects, &s;uch as plants and animals, as well as all other objects which once were not, are al&s;o perceived as effects, or as the production of &s;ome cau&s;e. The que&s;tion will always recur, how came it here? who made it? what is the cau&s;e of its exi&s;tence?</P>
<P>WE are &s;o accu&s;tomed to human arts, that every work of de&s;ign and u&s;e will be attri|buted to man. But what if it exceed his known powers and faculties? This &s;uppo&s;i|tion does not alter the nature of our feel|ings; but only leads us to a different cau&s;e, and, in place of man, to determine upon &s;ome &s;uperior power. If the object be con|&s;idered as an effect, it nece&s;&s;arily involves the
<PB N="327" REF="329">
idea of a cau&s;e. And the cau&s;e cannot be man, if the object of our perception be an effect far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the power of man. This train of thinking leads us directly to our point. Attend but to the anatomy of the meane&s;t plant: &s;o much of art and of curi|ous mechani&s;m is di&s;covered in it, that it mu&s;t be the production of &s;ome cau&s;e, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the power and intelligence of man. The &s;cene opens more and more, when, pa&s;|&s;ing from plants to animals, we come to man, the mo&s;t wonderful of all the works of na|ture. And when, at la&s;t, we take in, at one view, the natural and moral world, full of harmony, order and beauty; happily ad|ju&s;ted in all its parts to an&s;wer great and glo|rious purpo&s;es; there is, in this grand pro|duction, nece&s;&s;arily involved, the perception of a cau&s;e, unbounded in power, intelligence and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>THUS it is, that the Deity has manife&s;ted him&s;elf to us, by the means of principles wrought into our nature, which mu&s;t infal|libly
<PB N="328" REF="330">
operate, upon viewing objects in their relation of cau&s;e and effect. We di&s;cover ex|ternal objects by their qualities of colour, figure, &s;ize and motion. In the perception of the&s;e qualities, connected after a certain manner, is comprehended, the feeling of the &s;ub&s;tance or thing, to which the&s;e qualities be|long. At the &s;ame time, we perceive this &s;ub&s;tance or thing, &s;uppo&s;ing it to have a be|ginning of exi&s;tence, to be an effect produ|ced by &s;ome cau&s;e; and we perceive the pow|ers and properties of this cau&s;e from its ef|fects. If there is an aptitude in the effect to &s;ome end, we attribute to the cau&s;e, intelli|gence and de&s;ign. If the effect produced be &s;ome thing that is good in it&s;elf, or that has a tendency to &s;ome good end or pupo&s;e, we attribute goodne&s;s to the cau&s;e, as well as intelligence and de&s;ign. And this we do, not by any proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, but merely by perception and feeling. The Deity has not left his exi&s;tence to be gathered from &s;lip|pery and far-fetched arguments. We have but to open our eyes, to receive impre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="329" REF="331">
of him almo&s;t from every thing we perceive. We di&s;cover his being and attributes, in the &s;ame manner that we di&s;cover external objects. We have but to appeal to our own perceptions; and none but tho&s;e, who are &s;o &s;tubbornly hypothetical, as to deny the exi&s;t|ence of matter, again&s;t the evidence of their &s;en&s;es, can, &s;eriou&s;ly and deliberately, deny the exi&s;tence of the Deity. In fine, there is a wonderful harmony e&s;tabli&s;hed betwixt our perceptions and the cour&s;e of nature. We tru&s;t to our perceptions, for the exi&s;tence of external objects, and their pa&s;t, pre&s;ent and future operations. We tru&s;t to the&s;e perceptions by the nece&s;&s;ity of our nature, and, upon experience, find our&s;elves not de|ceived. Our perception of the Deity, is as di&s;tinct and authoritative, as that of external objects. And tho' here, we cannot have ex|perience to appeal to, the want of experi|ence can never afford an argument again&s;t the authority of any perception, where, from the nature of the thing, there can be no ex|perience. It is &s;ufficient for conviction, that
<PB N="330" REF="332">
our perceptions in general corre&s;pond to the truth of things, wherever there is an oppor|tunity to try them by experience; and there|fore, we can have no cau&s;e to doubt of our perceptions in any ca&s;e, where they are not contradicted by experience.</P>
<P>SO far the Deity is di&s;coverable, by every per&s;on who goes but one &s;tep beyond the &s;urface of things, and their mere exi&s;tence. We may indeed behold the earth in its gaye&s;t dre&s;s, the heavens in all their glory, without having any perception, other than that of beauty, &s;omething in the&s;e objects that plea|&s;es and delights us. Many pa&s;s their lives, bruti&s;hly involved in the gro&s;s plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, without having any feeling, at lea&s;t, any &s;trong or permanent feeling, of the Dei|ty; and po&s;&s;ibly, this in general is the ca&s;e of &s;avages, before they are humanized by &s;o|ciety and government. But the Deity can|not be long a &s;ecret from tho&s;e who are ac|cu&s;tomed to any degree of reflection. No &s;ooner are we enabled to reli&s;h beauties of
<PB N="331" REF="333">
the &s;econd and third cla&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the e&s;&s;ay upon the foundation and principles of the law of nature.</NOTE>; no &s;ooner do we acquire a ta&s;te for regularity, order, de|&s;ign, and good purpo&s;e, than we begin to per|ceive the Deity, in the beauty of the opera|tions of nature. Savages who have no con|&s;i&s;tent rule of conduct, who act by the blind impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion and appetite, and who have only a glimmering of the moral &s;en&s;e, are but ill qualified to di&s;cover the Deity in his works. If they have little or no percep|tion of a ju&s;t tenor of life, of the dignity of behaviour, and of the beauty of action, how &s;hould they perceive the beauty of the works of creation, and the admirable harmony of all the parts, in the great &s;y&s;tem of things? Being con&s;cious of nothing but di&s;order and &s;en&s;ual impul&s;e within, they cannot be con|&s;cious of any thing better without them. Society teaches mankind &s;elf-denial, and im|proves the moral &s;en&s;e. Di&s;ciplined in &s;o|ciety, the ta&s;te for order and regularity un|folds it&s;elf by degrees. The &s;ocial affecti|ons
<PB N="332" REF="334">
gain the a&s;cendant, and the morality of actions gets firm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind. In this improved &s;tate, the beauty of the crea|tion makes a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion; and, we can never cea&s;e admiring the excellency of that cau&s;e, who is the author of &s;o many beautiful effects. And thus, to &s;ociety we owe all the ble&s;&s;ings of life, and, particularly, the know|ledge of the Deity, that mo&s;t ine&s;timable branch of human knowledge.</P>
<P>HITHERTO we have gone no further, than to point out the means by which we di&s;cover the Deity, and his attributes of pow|er, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. So far are we carried by tho&s;e wonderful principles in our nature, which di&s;cover the connection be|twixt cau&s;e and effect, and from the ef|fect di&s;cover the powers and properties of the cau&s;e. But there is one attribute of the Supreme Being, of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential kind, which remains to be unfolded. It is, what commonly pa&s;&s;es under the name of &s;elf-exi&s;tence, that he mu&s;t have exi&s;ted for
<PB N="333" REF="335">
ever; and con&s;equently, that he cannot be con&s;idered as an effect, to require a cau&s;e of his exi&s;tence; but, on the contrary, without being cau&s;ed, that, mediately, or immediate|ly, he is the cau&s;e of all other things. A principle, we have had occa&s;ion, more than once, to mention, will make this evident, <HI>&s;ciz.</HI> that nothing can begin to exi&s;t with|out a cau&s;e. Every thing which comes in|to exi&s;tence, and once was not, is, by a ne|ce&s;&s;ary determination of our nature, perceiv|ed as an effect, or as a production; the very conception of which, involves an adequate cau&s;e. Now, if every thing has a begin|ning, one being, at lea&s;t, to wit, that which fir&s;t came into exi&s;tence, mu&s;t be an effect or production without a cau&s;e, which is a di|rect incon&s;i&s;tency. If all beings had a be|ginning, there was a time, when the world was an ab&s;olute void; upon which &s;uppo&s;i|tion, it is intuitively certain, that nothing could ever have come into exi&s;tence. This propo&s;ition we feel to be true, and our feel|ing affords us, in this ca&s;e, a more &s;olid con|viction,
<PB N="334" REF="336">
than any demon&s;tration can do. One being, therefore, mu&s;t have exi&s;ted from all eternity, who, as he is not an effect or production, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be indebted for his exi&s;tence to any other being. At the &s;ame time, as we can have no foundation for &s;uppo&s;ing the exi&s;tence of more eternal beings than one, this one being mu&s;t be the Deity; becau&s;e, all other beings, mediately, or immediately, owe their exi&s;tence to him. All other beings, as they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be produced in time, mu&s;t have a cau&s;e of their exi&s;tence, and, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, there can be no other cau&s;e but this eternal Being. The bulk of mankind, probably, in their no|tions of the Deity, &s;carce comprehend this attribute of &s;elf-exi&s;tence. A man mu&s;t be u&s;ed, a good deal, to ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, who of him&s;elf di&s;covers this truth. But it is not difficult to explain it to others, after it is di&s;|covered. And it de&s;erves well to be incul|cated; for, without it, our knowledge of the Deity mu&s;t be extremely imperfect. His other attributes of power, wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s,
<PB N="335" REF="337">
are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, communicated to his creatures; but his attribute of &s;elf-exi&s;|tence makes the &s;tronge&s;t oppo&s;ition imagin|able, betwixt him and his creatures.</P>
<P>A FEW words will &s;uffice upon the third propo&s;ition, which, in a good mea&s;ure, is al|ready explained. The e&s;&s;ence of the Deity is far beyond the reach of our comprehen&s;i|on. Were he to exhibit him&s;elf to us, in broad day-light, it is not a thing &s;uppo&s;able, that he could be reached by any of our ex|ternal &s;en&s;es. The attributes of &s;elf-exi&s;tence, wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and power, are purely in|tellectual. And therefore, &s;o far as we can comprehend, there are no ordinary means to acquire any knowledge of the Deity, but by his works. And indeed, by means of that &s;en&s;e which di&s;covers cau&s;es from their ef|fects, he has manife&s;ted him&s;elf to us in a fa|tisfactory manner, liable to no doubt nor error. And after all, what further evidence can we de&s;ire, when the evidence we have of his exi&s;tence is little inferior to that we
<PB N="336" REF="338">
have of our own exi&s;tence? Impre&s;&s;ions or perceptions &s;erve us for evidence in both ca&s;|es <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the e&s;&s;ay upon the idea of &s;elf and per&s;onal iden|tity.</NOTE>. Our own exi&s;tence, indeed, is, of all facts, that which concerns us mo&s;t; and, therefore, of our own exi&s;tence we ought to have the highe&s;t certainty. Next to it, we have not, as it appears to me, a greater cer|tainty of any matter of fact, than of the ex|i&s;tence of the Deity. 'Tis, at lea&s;t, equal to the certainty we have of external objects, and of the con&s;tancy and uniformity of the operations of nature, upon the faith of which our whole &s;chemes of life are adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>THE arguments <HI>a po&s;teriori,</HI> which have been urged for the Being and attributes of the Deity, are generally defective. There is always wanting one link of the chain, to wit, that peculiar principle, upon which is founded our knowledge of cau&s;es and their ef|fects. But the calm perceptions, turning habi|tual by frequent repetition, are apt to be over|looked
<PB N="337" REF="339">
in our rea&s;onings. Many a pro|po&s;ition is rendered ob&s;cure, by much la|boured argument, for the truth of which, we need but appeal to our own percepti|ons. Thus, we are told, that the frame and order of the world, the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s di&s;played in every part of it, are an evident demon&s;tration of the Being of a God. I confe&s;s, the&s;e things afford us full conviction of his Being. But, laying a|&s;ide perception and feeling, I &s;hould be ut|terly at a lo&s;s, by any &s;ort of rea&s;oning, to conclude the exi&s;tence of any one thing, from that of any other thing. In particular, by what proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, can we demon|&s;trate this conclu&s;ion to be true, that order and beauty mu&s;t needs proceed from a de|&s;igning cau&s;e? It is true, the idea of an effect involves the idea of a cau&s;e. But how does rea&s;on make out, that the thing we name an effect, may not exi&s;t of it&s;elf, as well as what we name a cau&s;e? If it be urged, that hu|man works, where means are apparently ad|ju&s;ted to an end, and beautty and order di&s;|covered,
<PB N="338" REF="340">
are always known to be the effects of intelligence and de&s;ign. True, they are: and as far as I have experience, I believe the fact to be &s;o. But, where experience fails me, I de&s;ire to know, by what &s;tep, what link in the chain of rea&s;oning, am I to con|nect my pa&s;t experience with this inference, that in every ca&s;e, I ought to form the &s;ame conclu&s;ion? If it be &s;aid, that nature prompts us to judge of &s;imilar in&s;tances, by former experience; this is giving up rea&s;on and de|mon&s;tration, to appeal to that very feeling, on which, I contend, the evidence of this truth mu&s;t entirely re&s;t. All the arguments <HI>a po&s;teriori,</HI> may be re&s;olved into this princi|ple; which, no doubt, has had its due influ|ence upon the writers who handle the pre|&s;ent &s;ubject; tho', I mu&s;t be allowed to &s;ay, it has not been explained, nor, perhaps, &s;uffi|ciently under&s;tood by them; whereby, all of them have been led into the error, of &s;tating as demon&s;trative rea&s;oning, what is only an appeal to our &s;en&s;es. They rea&s;on, for ex|ample, upon the equality of males and fe|males,
<PB N="339" REF="341">
and hold the infinite odds again&s;t this equality, to be a demon&s;tration, that matters cannot be carried on by chance. This, con|&s;idered as mere rea&s;oning, does not con|clude; for, be&s;ides that chance is infinite in its varieties, there may be, &s;ome blind fata|lity, &s;ome unknown cau&s;e, in the nature of things, which produces this uniformity. But tho' rea&s;on cannot afford demon&s;tration in this ca&s;e, &s;en&s;e and feeling afford conviction. The equality of males and females, is one of the many in&s;tances which we know and feel to be the effects of a de&s;igning cau&s;e; and of which we can no more entertain a doubt, than of our own exi&s;tence. The &s;ame principle, which unfolds to us the con|nection of cau&s;es and their effects, in the mo&s;t common events, di&s;covers this whole uni|ver&s;e to &s;tand in the relation of an effect to a &s;upreme cau&s;e.</P>
<P>To &s;ub&s;titute feeling in place of rea&s;on and demon&s;tration, may &s;eem to put the evi|dence of the Deity upon too low a footing.
<PB N="340" REF="342">
But human rea&s;on is not &s;o mighty an affair, as philo&s;ophers vainly pretend. It affords very little aid, in making original di&s;coveries. The comparing of things together, and directing our inferences from feeling and experience, are its proper province. In this way, rea&s;on gives its aid, to lead us to the knowledge of the Deity. It enlarges our views of final cau&s;|es, and of the prevalence of wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s. But the application of the argument from final cau&s;es, to prove the exi&s;tence of a Deity, and the force of our conclu&s;ion, from beautiful and orderly effects to a de&s;igning cau&s;e, are not from rea&s;on, but from an inter|nal light, which &s;hows things in their relation of cau&s;e and effect. The&s;e conclu&s;ions re&s;t en|tirely upon &s;en&s;e and feeling; and it is &s;ur|pri&s;ing, that writers &s;hould overlook what is &s;o natural, and &s;o obvious. But the pride of man's heart, makes him de&s;ire to extend his di&s;coveries, by dint of rea&s;oning. For rea&s;on|ing is our own work. There is merit in acute|ne&s;s and penetration; and we are better
<PB N="341" REF="343">
plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ume merit to our&s;elves, than humbly to acknowledge, that, to the mo&s;t important di&s;coveries, we are directly led by the hand of the Almighty.</P>
<P>HAVING unfolded that principle, upon which I would re&s;t the mo&s;t important of all truths; objections mu&s;t not be overlook|ed, &s;uch as appear to have weight: and I &s;hall endeavour to give the&s;e objections their &s;tronge&s;t effect, which ought to be done in every di&s;pute, and which becomes more &s;trict|ly a duty, in handling a &s;ubject, where truth is of the utmo&s;t importance.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING the above argument on all &s;ides, I do not find, that it can be more advantageou&s;ly combated, than by oppo&s;ing to it, the eternity and &s;elf-exi&s;tence of the world, governed by chance or blind fatality. 'Tis above admitted to be very difficult, by any ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, to prove the incon&s;i&s;|tency of this &s;uppo&s;ition. But we feel the incon&s;i&s;tency; for the frame and conduct of
<PB N="342" REF="344">
this world, contain in them, too much of wi&s;|dom, art and fore&s;ight, to admit of the &s;up|po&s;ition of chance or blind fatality. We are nece&s;&s;arily determined, by a principle in our nature, to attribute &s;uch effects to &s;ome intelligent and de&s;igning cau&s;e. Suppo&s;ing this cau&s;e to be the world it&s;elf, we have, at lea&s;t, got free of the &s;uppo&s;ition of chance and blind &s;atality. And, if the world be a being, endued with unbounded power, in|telligence and benevolence, the world is the being we are in que&s;t of; for we have no other idea of the Deity, but of an eternal and &s;elf-exi&s;tent being, endued with power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. But the hypothe&s;is, thus reformed, &s;till contradicts our percepti|ons. The world is made up of parts, &s;epar|able, and actually &s;eparated. The attributes of unbounded power, intelligence and bene|volence, do certainly not belong to this earth, and as little to the &s;un, moon or &s;tars, which are not conceived to be even volun|tary agents. Therefore, the&s;e attributes mu&s;t belong to a Being, who made the earth,
<PB N="343" REF="345">
&s;un, moon and &s;tars, and who connects the whole together in one &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>A SECOND objection may be, that the above rea&s;oning, by which we conclude the eternity and &s;elf-exi&s;tence of one Being who made this world, does not nece&s;&s;arily infer &s;uch a conclu&s;ion, but only, an eternal &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch beings; which may be rec|koned a more natural &s;uppo&s;ition, and more agreeable to our feelings, than the idea of one eternal &s;elf-exi&s;tent Being, without any cau&s;e of his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>IN matters &s;o profound, it is difficult to form ideas with any degree of accuracy. I have ob&s;erved above, that it is too much for man, to gra&s;p, in his idea, an eternal Being, who&s;e exi&s;tence, upon that account, cannot admit of the &s;uppo&s;ition of a cau&s;e. To talk, as &s;ome of our metaphy&s;ical writers do, of an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity in the nature of the Be|ing, as the cau&s;e of his exi&s;tence, is mere jargon. For we can conceive nothing more
<PB N="344" REF="346">
clearly, than that the cau&s;e mu&s;t go before the effect, and that the cau&s;e cannot po&s;&s;ibly be in the effect. But, however difficult it may be, to conceive one eternal Being, with|out a cau&s;e of its exi&s;tence; it is not le&s;s dif|ficult, to conceive an eternal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of beings, deriving their exi&s;tence from each other. For, tho' every link be &s;uppo&s;ed a production, the chain it&s;elf exi&s;ts without a cau&s;e, as well as one eternal Being does. Therefore, an eternal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of beings, is not a more natural &s;uppo&s;ition, than one eternal &s;elf-exi&s;tent Being. And taking it in a different light, it will appear a &s;uppo&s;i|tion much le&s;s natural, or rather altogether unnatural. Succe&s;&s;ion in exi&s;tence, imply|ing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive annihilation of particulars, is indeed a very natural conception. But then, it is intimately connected with frail and dependent beings, and cannot, without the utmo&s;t violence to the conception, be applied to the Maker of all things, to whom, we naturally a&s;cribe, perpetual exi&s;tence, and every other perfection. And therefore, as
<PB N="345" REF="347">
this hypothe&s;is of a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, when applied to the Deity, is de&s;titute of a|ny &s;upport from rea&s;on or experience, and is contradicted by every one of our natural feel|ings, there can be no ground for adopting it.</P>
<P>THE noted ob&s;ervation of Lucretius, that <HI>primos in orbe deos fecit timor,</HI> may be ob|jected; as it will be thought unphilo&s;ophical, to multiply cau&s;es for our belief of a Deity, when fear alone mu&s;t have that effect. For my part, I have little doubt of the truth of the ob&s;ervation, taking it in its proper &s;en&s;e, that fear is the foundation of our belief of invi&s;ible malevolent powers. For it is evi|dent, that fear can never be the cau&s;e of our belief of a benevolent Deity. I have unfolded, in another e&s;&s;ay <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of our dread of &s;upernatural powers in the dark.</NOTE>, the cau&s;e of our dread of malevolent invi&s;ible powers. And I am per&s;uaded, that nothing has been more hurtful to religion, than the irregular propen&s;ity in our nature, to dread &s;uch pow|ers. Superficial thinkers are apt to confound
<PB N="346" REF="348">
the&s;e phantoms of the imagination, with the objects of our true and genuine perceptions. And finding &s;o little reality in the former, they are apt to conclude the latter, al&s;o, to be a fiction. But, if they gave any &s;ort of deliberate attention, they would &s;oon learn, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of hi&s;tory, if not by origi|nal feeling, to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e objects, as having no real connection with each other. Man, in his original &s;avage &s;tate, is a &s;hy and timorous animal, dreading every new object, and attributing every extraordinary e|vent, to &s;ome invi&s;ible malevolent power. Led, at the &s;ame time, by mere appetite, he has little idea of regularity and order, of the morality of actions, or of the beauty of na|ture. In this &s;tate, it is no wonder, he mul|tiplies his invi&s;ible malevolent powers, with|out entertaining any notion of a &s;upreme Be|ing, the Creator of all things. As man rip|ens in &s;ociety, and is benefited by the good|will of others, his dread of new objects gra|dually le&s;&s;ens. He begins to perceive regu|larity and order in the cour&s;e of nature. He
<PB N="347" REF="349">
becomes &s;harp-&s;ighted, in di&s;covering cau&s;es from effects, and effects from cau&s;es. He a&s;cends gradually, thro' the different orders of beings, and their operations, till he di&s;|covers the Deity, who is the cau&s;e of all things. And when we run over the hi&s;tory of man, it will be found to hold true in fact, that &s;avages, who are mo&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;t with the opinion of evil &s;pirits, have, of all people, the lea&s;t idea of a Deity; and, that as all civilized nations, without exception, entertain the firm belief of a Deity, &s;o the dread of evil &s;pirits wears out in every nation, in proportion to their gradual advances in &s;ocial intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>AND this leads to a reflection, which can|not fail to have univer&s;al influence. Man, in a &s;avage and bruti&s;h &s;tate, is hurried a|way by every gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, and by every phantom of the imagination. His powers and faculties are improved by education, and good culture. He acquires deep knowledge in the nature of things, and learns accurate|ly to di&s;tingui&s;h truth from fal&s;ehood. What
<PB N="348" REF="350">
more &s;atisfying evidence can we require, of the truth of our perceptions of the Deity, than to find the&s;e perceptions prevalent, in proportion, as mankind improve in the arts of life? The&s;e perceptions go hand in hand with the rational powers. As man increa&s;|es in knowledge, and in the di&s;cerning fa|culties, his perceptions of the Deity become proportionally more &s;trong, clear and autho|ritative. The univer&s;al conviction of a Dei|ty, which has, without exception, &s;pread through all civilized nations, cannot po&s;&s;i|bly be without a foundation in nature. To in&s;i&s;t that it may, is to in&s;i&s;t, that an ef|fect may be without an adequate cau&s;e. Rea|&s;on cannot be an adequate cau&s;e; becau&s;e, our rea&s;onings upon this &s;ubject, mu&s;t, at be&s;t, be ab&s;tru&s;e, and beyond the comprehen|&s;ion of the bulk of mankind. Our know|ledge, therefore, of the Deity, mu&s;t be found|ed on our perceptions and feelings, which are common to mankind. And it is agree|able to the analogy of nature, that God &s;hould di&s;cover him&s;elf to his rational crea|tures
<PB N="349" REF="351">
after this manner. If this &s;ubject be involved in any degree of ob&s;curity, writers are to blame, who, in a matter of &s;o great importance, ought to give no quarter to inac|curacy of thought or expre&s;&s;ion. But it is an error, common to the bulk of writers, to &s;ub&s;titute rea&s;on for feeling. The faculty of perception, working &s;ilently, and without effort, is generally overlookt. And we mu&s;t find a rea&s;on for every thing we judge to be true; tho' the truth of the propo&s;ition often depends, not upon rea&s;oning, but upon mere feeling. It is thus, that morality has been brought under &s;ome ob&s;curity, by metaphy|&s;ical writers; and it is equally to be regret|ed, that the knowledge of the Deity has been brought under ob&s;curity, by the &s;ame &s;ort of writers.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;ettled the belief of a Deity up|on its proper ba&s;is, we &s;hall proceed to take a general view of the attributes, which be|long to that great Being; and fir&s;t,</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> UNITY <HI>of the</HI> DEITY.</HEAD>
<P>WITH regard to this, and all the o|ther attributes of the Deity, it ought to be no di&s;couraging reflection, that we cannot attain an adequate idea of them. The Deity is too grand an object, to be compre|hended, in any perfect manner, by the hu|man mind. We have not words nor ideas, which any way corre&s;pond to the manner of his exi&s;tence. Should &s;ome good angel un|dertake to be our in&s;tructor, we would &s;till be at a lo&s;s, to form a di&s;tinct conception of it. Power, intelligence and goodne&s;s, are attributes which we can comprehend. But with regard to the nature of the Deity in general, and the manner of his exi&s;t|ence, we mu&s;t be &s;atisfied, in this mortal &s;tate, to remain much in the dark. The at|tribute of <HI>Unity,</HI> is what, of all, we can have the lea&s;t certainty about, by the light of na|ture. It is not incon&s;i&s;tent, that there &s;hould be two or more beings of the very highe&s;t or|der, who&s;e e&s;&s;ence and actions are &s;o regulated

by the nature of the beings them&s;elves, as to be altogether concordant and harmoni|ous.

<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> BENEVOLENCE <HI>of the</HI> DEITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE mixed nature of the events, which fall under our ob&s;ervation, &s;eems, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to point out a mixed cau&s;e, partly good and partly evil. The author of <Q>phi|lo&s;ophical e&s;&s;ays concerning human un|der&s;tanding,</Q> in his eleventh e&s;&s;ay, <Q>of the practical con&s;equences of natural reli|gion,</Q> puts in the mouth of an Epicurean philo&s;opher, a very &s;hrewd argument again&s;t the benevolence of the Deity. The &s;um of it is what follows. <Q>If the cau&s;e be known only by the effect, we never ought to a&s;|&s;ign to it any qualities, beyond what are preci&s;ely requi&s;ite to produce the effect. Allowing therefore God to be the Author of the exi&s;tence and order of the univer&s;e; it follows, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that preci&s;e degree of power, intelligence and benevo|lence, which appears in his workman&s;hip.</Q> And hence, from the pre&s;ent &s;eene of things, apparently &s;o full of ill and di&s;order, it is
<PB N="354" REF="356">
concluded, <Q>That we have no foundation for a&s;cribing any attribute to the Deity, but what is preci&s;ely commen&s;urate with the imperfection of this world.</Q> With regard to mankind, an exception is made. <Q>In works of human art and contrivance, it is admitted, that we can advance from the effect to the cau&s;e, and returning back from the cau&s;e, that we conclude new effects, which have not yet exi&s;ted. Thus, for in|&s;tance, from the &s;ight of a half-fini&s;hed building, &s;urrounded with heaps of &s;tones and mortar, and all the in&s;truments of ma&s;onry, we naturally conclude, that the building will be fini&s;hed, and receive all the farther improvements, which art can be|&s;tow upon it. But the foundation of this rea&s;oning is, plainly, that man is a being whom we know by experience, and who&s;e motives and de&s;igns we are acquainted with, which enables us to draw many in|ferences, concerning what may be expect|ed from him. But did we know man on|ly from the &s;ingle work or production,
<PB N="355" REF="357">
which we examine, we could not argue in this manner; becau&s;e our knowledge of all the qualities which we a&s;cribe to him, being, upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, derived from the work or production, it is impo&s;&s;ible they could point any thing farther, or be the foundation of any new inference.</Q></P>
<P>SUPPOSING rea&s;on to be our only guide in the&s;e matters, which is &s;uppo&s;ed by this philo&s;opher in his argument, I cannot help &s;eeing his rea&s;oning to be ju&s;t. It appears to be true, that by no inference of rea&s;on, can I conclude any power or benevolence in the cau&s;e, beyond what is di&s;played in the effect. But this is no wonderful di&s;covery. The philo&s;opher might have carried his argu|ment a greater length. He might have ob|&s;erved, even with regard to a man I am per|fectly acquainted with, that I cannot con|clude, by any chain of rea&s;oning, he will fi|ni&s;h the hou&s;e he has begun. 'Tis to no purpo&s;e to urge his temper and di&s;po&s;ition. For, from what principle of rea&s;on can I in|fer,
<PB N="356" REF="358">
that the&s;e will continue the &s;ame as for|merly? He might further have ob&s;erved, that the difficulty is greater, with regard to a man I know nothing of, &s;uppo&s;ing him to have begun the building. For what founda|tion have I, to transfer the qualities of the per&s;ons I am acquainted with, to &s;trangers? This &s;urely is not performed by any proce&s;s of rea&s;oning. There is &s;till a wider &s;tep, which is, that rea&s;on will not help me out in attributing to the Deity, even that preci&s;e degree of power, intelligence and benevo|lence, which appears in his workman&s;hip. I find no incon&s;i&s;tency in &s;uppo&s;ing, that a blind and unde&s;igning cau&s;e may be produc|tive of excellent effects. It will, I pre&s;ume, be difficult to produce a demon&s;tration to the contrary. And &s;uppo&s;ing, at the in&s;tant of operation, the Deity to have been endu|ed with the&s;e properties, can we make out, by any argument <HI>a priori,</HI> that they are &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in him? Nay, this &s;ame philo&s;o|pher might have gone a great way further, by ob&s;erving, when any thing comes into ex|i&s;tence,
<PB N="357" REF="359">
that, by no proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, can we &s;o much as infer any cau&s;e of its exi&s;t|ence.</P>
<P>BUT happily for man, where rea&s;on fails him, perception and feeling come to his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. By means of principles implanted in our nature, we are enabled to make the above conclu&s;ions and inferences, as, at full length is made out, in &s;ome of the forego|ing e&s;&s;ays. More particularly, power, di&s;|covered in any object, is perceived as a per|manent quality, like figure or exten&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay upon our knowledge of future events.</NOTE>. Upon this account, power di&s;covered by a &s;ingle effect, is con&s;idered, as &s;ufficient, to produce the like effects without end. Fur|ther, great power may be di&s;covered from a &s;mall effect; which holds even in bodily &s;trength; as where an action is performed readily, and without effort. This is equal|ly remarkable in wi&s;dom and intelligence. A very &s;hort argument may unfold correct|ne&s;s of judgment and a deep reach. The
<PB N="358" REF="360">
&s;ame holds in art and skill. Examining a &s;light piece of workman&s;hip done with ta&s;te, we readily ob&s;erve, that the arti&s;t was equal to a greater task. But it is mo&s;t of all re|markable in the quality of benevolence. For even, from a &s;ingle effect produced by an un|known cau&s;e, which appears to be accurate|ly adapted to &s;ome good purpo&s;e, we nece&s;|&s;arily attribute to this cau&s;e, benevolence, as well as power and wi&s;dom <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay of our idea of power, at the clo&s;e.</NOTE>. It is in|deed but a weak perception, which ari&s;es from a &s;ingle effect: but &s;till, it is a clear and di&s;tinct perception of pure benevolence, without any mixture of malice; for &s;uch con|tradictory qualities, are not readily to be a&s;|cribed to the &s;ame cau&s;e. There may be a difficulty indeed, where the effect is of a mixt nature, partly evil, partly good; or where a variety of effects, having the&s;e op|po&s;ite characters, proceed from the &s;ame cau&s;e. Such intricate ca&s;es cannot fail to embara&s;s us. But, as we mu&s;t form &s;ome &s;entiment, the re&s;olution of the difficulty
<PB N="359" REF="361">
plainly is, that we mu&s;t a&s;cribe benevo|lence or malevolence to the cau&s;e, from the prevalence of the one or other quality in the effects. If evil makes the greate&s;t fi|gure, we perceive the cau&s;e to be malevolent, notwith&s;tanding of oppo&s;ite in&s;tances of goodne&s;s. If, upon the whole, goodne&s;s is &s;upereminent, we perceive the cau&s;e to be benevolent; and are not moved by the cro&s;s in&s;tances of evil, which we endeavour to reconcile, as we can, to pure benevolence. It is, indeeed, true, that where the oppo&s;ite effects nearly balance each other, our per|ception cannot be entire upon the &s;ide of be|nevolence or malevolence. But, if good or evil greatly preponderate, the weight in the oppo&s;ite &s;cale goes for nothing: the per|ception is entire upon one &s;ide or other. Becau&s;e it is the tendency of our percepti|ons, to reject a mixt character made up of benevolence and malevolence, unle&s;s, where it is nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;t home upon us, by an equality of oppo&s;ite effects.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="362">
SUCH are the conclu&s;ions, that we can with certainty draw, not indeed from rea&s;on, but from &s;en&s;e and feeling. So little are we acquainted with the e&s;&s;ence and nature of things, that we cannot e&s;tabli&s;h the&s;e con|clu&s;ions upon any argument <HI>a priori.</HI> Nor would it be of great benefit to mankind, to have the&s;e conclu&s;ions demon&s;trated to them; few having either lei&s;ure or genius to deal in &s;uch profound &s;peculations.

This is a &s;olid foundation for our conviction of the benevolence of the Deity. If, from a &s;ingle effect, pure benevolence in the cau&s;e can be perceived or felt; what doubt can there be, of the pure benevolence of the Deity, when we &s;urvey his works, preg|nant with good-will to mankind? Innu|merable in&s;tances, of things wi&s;ely adapt|ed to good purpo&s;es, give us the &s;tronge&s;t feeling, of the goodne&s;s, as well as wi&s;dom, of the Deity; which is joined with the firme&s;t

per&s;ua&s;ion of con&s;tancy and uniformity in his operations. A few cro&s;s in&s;tances, which to us, weak-&s;ighted mortals, may appear of evil tendency, ought not, and cannot make us waver. When we know &s;o little of na|ture, it would be &s;urpri&s;ing, indeed, if we &s;hould be able to account for every event, and its final tendency. Unle&s;s we were let into the coun&s;els of the Almighty, we can never hope to unravel all the my&s;teries of the creation.</P>
<P>As we cannot &s;ay too much upon a &s;ub|ject, which is of all the mo&s;t intere&s;ting, I &s;hall add &s;ome other con&s;iderations, to ju&s;|tify our belief of the pure benevolence of the Deity. And, in the fir&s;t place, I ven|ture to lay it down for a truth, that pure malice, is a principle not to be found in hu|man nature. The benevolence of man, is, in|deed, often checked and counteracted by jea|lou&s;y, envy, and other &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions. But, the&s;e are di&s;tinct from pure malice; for, pure goodne&s;s is not oppo&s;ite to &s;elf-intere&s;t, but
<PB N="362" REF="364">
to &s;atisfaction in the misfortunes and mi|&s;eries of others. Now, the independent and all-&s;ufficient nature of the Deity, &s;ets him above all &s;u&s;picion of being liable to envy, or the pur&s;uit of any intere&s;t, other than the general intere&s;t of his creatures. Wants, weakne&s;s, and oppo&s;ition of inte|re&s;ts, are the cau&s;es of ill-will and malice a|mong men. From all &s;uch influences, the Deity mu&s;t be exempted. And therefore, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e him le&s;s perfect than the creatures he has made, we cannot readily &s;uppo&s;e, that there is any degree of malice in his nature.</P>
<P>THERE is a &s;econd con&s;ideration, which has always afforded me great &s;atisfaction. Did natural evil prevail in reality, as much as it does in appearance, we mu&s;t expect, that the enlargement of natural knowledge, &s;hould daily di&s;cover new in&s;tances of bad, as well as of good intention. But the fact is directly otherways. Our di&s;coveries a&s;cer|tain us more and more of the benevolence
<PB N="363" REF="365">
of the Deity, by unfolding beautiful final cau&s;es without number; while the appear|ances of evil intention gradually vani&s;h, like a mi&s;t, after the &s;un breaks out. Many things are now found to be curious in their contrivance, and productive of good effects, which formerly appeared u&s;ele&s;s, or, perhaps, of evil tendency. And, in the gradual pro|gre&s;s of learning, we have the &s;tronge&s;t rea|&s;on to expect, that many more di&s;coveries, of the like kind, will be made hereafter. This very con&s;ideration, had we nothing el&s;e to rely on, ought to make us re&s;t upon the a&s;|&s;urance which our feelings give us of the be|nevolence of the Deity; without giving way to the perplexity of a few cro&s;s appearances, which, in matters &s;o far beyond our com|prehen&s;ion, ought to be a&s;cribed to our own ignorance, and, by no means, to any male|volence in the Deity.</P>
<P>I SHALL &s;atisfy my&s;elf with &s;ugge&s;ting but one other ob&s;ervation, that, inferring a mixed nature in the Deity, from events
<PB N="364" REF="366">
which cannot be clearly reconciled to be|nevolence, is at be&s;t, new moulding the Manichean &s;y&s;tem, by &s;ub&s;tituting, in place of it, one really le&s;s plau&s;ible. For, I can, with greater facility, form a conception of two oppo&s;ite powers, governing the univer&s;e, than of one power, endued with great good|ne&s;s, and great malevolence; which are prin|ciples repugnant to each other.</P>
<P>IT thus appears, that our conviction of this attribute of pure benevolence, has a wide and &s;olid foundation. It is impre&s;&s;ed upon us by a natural feeling, by every di&s;covery we make in the &s;cience of nature, and by e|very argument which is &s;ugge&s;ted by rea&s;on and reflection. There is but one objection of any weight, which can be moved again&s;t it, ari&s;ing from the difficulty of accounting for natural and moral evil. It is ob&s;erved a|bove, that this objection, however it may puzzle, ought not to &s;hake our faith in this attribute; becau&s;e, an argument from igno|rance, can never be a convincing argument
<PB N="365" REF="367">
in any ca&s;e; and this therefore, in its &s;trong|e&s;t light, appears but in the &s;hape of a dif|ficulty, not of a &s;olid objection. At the &s;ame time, as the utmo&s;t labour of thought is well be&s;towed upon a &s;ubject, in which mankind is &s;o much intere&s;ted, I &s;hall pro|ceed to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome reflections, which may tend to &s;atisfy us, that the in&s;tances com|monly given of natural and moral evil, are not &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with pure benevolence, as, at fir&s;t &s;ight, may be imagined.</P>
<P>ONE preliminary point mu&s;t be &s;ettled, which, I pre&s;ume, will be admitted without much he&s;itation. It certainly will not be thought, in any degree, incon&s;i&s;tent with the pure benevolence of the Deity, that the world is filled with an endle&s;s variety of creatures, gradually a&s;cending in the &s;cale of being, from the mo&s;t groveling, to the mo&s;t glorious. To think otherways, would be in effect to think, that all inanimate beings ought to be endued with life and motion, and that all animate beings ought to be angels. If,
<PB N="366" REF="368">
at fir&s;t view, it &s;hall be thought, that infinite power and goodne&s;s cannot &s;top &s;hort of ab|&s;olute perfection in their operations, and that the work of creation mu&s;t be confined to the highe&s;t order of beings in the highe&s;t perfection; this thought will &s;oon be cor|rected, by con&s;idering, that, by this &s;uppo&s;i|tion, a great void is left, which, according to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of things, is filled with beings, and with life and motion. And, &s;up|po&s;ing the world to be repleni&s;hed with the highe&s;t order of beings, created in the high|e&s;t degree of perfection, it is certainly an act of more exten&s;ive benevolence, to complete the work of creation, by the addition of an infinity of creatures le&s;s perfect, than to leave a great blank, betwixt beings of the high|e&s;t order, and nothing.</P>
<P>THE imperfection then of a created be|ing, ab&s;tractly con&s;idered, is no impeach|ment of any of the attributes of the Deity, whether power, wi&s;dom, or benevolence. And if &s;o, neither can pain, ab&s;tractly con&s;i|dered,
<PB N="367" REF="369">
be an impeachment, &s;o far as it is the natural and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of imper|fection. The government of the world is carried on by general laws, which produce con&s;tancy and uniformity in the operations of nature. Among many rea&s;ons for this, we can clearly di&s;cover one, which is unfold|ed in a former e&s;&s;ay <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of our knowledge of future events.</NOTE>, that, were not na|ture uniform and con&s;tant, men, and other &s;en&s;ible beings, would be altogether at a lo&s;s how to conduct them&s;elves. Our nature is adju&s;ted to the&s;e general laws, and mu&s;t, therefore, be &s;ubjected to all their varieties, whether beneficial or hurtful. We are made &s;en&s;ible beings, and therefore equally ca|pable of plea&s;ure and pain. And it mu&s;t follow, from the very nature of the thing, that delicacy of feeling, which is the &s;ource of much plea&s;ure, may be equally the &s;ource of much pain. It is true, we cannot pronounce it to be a contradiction, that a being &s;hould be &s;u&s;ceptible of plea&s;ure only, and not of pain. But no argument can be founded up|on this &s;uppo&s;ition, but what will conclude,
<PB N="368" REF="370">
that a creature, &s;uch as man, ought to have no place in the &s;cale of beings; which &s;ure|ly will not be maintained. For it is &s;till bet|ter, that man be as he is, than not be at all. It is further to be ob&s;erved in general, that aver&s;ion to pain, is not &s;o great, at lea&s;t in mankind, as to counterbalance every other appetite. Mo&s;t men would purcha&s;e an ad|ditional &s;hare of happine&s;s, at the expence of &s;ome pain. And therefore, it can afford no argument again&s;t the benevolence of the Deity, that created beings are found liable to pain, from their nature and condition, &s;up|po&s;ing, in the main, their life to be comfort|able. Their &s;tate is &s;till preferable to that of inanimate matter, capable neither of plea|&s;ure nor pain.</P>
<P>THUS then, it appears, even from a ge|neral view of our &s;ubject, that natural evil affords no argument again&s;t the benevolence of the Deity. And this will &s;till appear in a &s;tronger light, when we go to particulars. It is fully laid open in the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, that the
<PB N="369" REF="371">
&s;ocial affections, even when mo&s;t painful, are accompanied with no degree of aver&s;ion, whether in the feeling it&s;elf, or in the after reflection. We value our&s;elves the more, for being &s;o affected; being con&s;cious that it is <HI>right</HI> and <HI>meet</HI> to be &s;o affected. Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, therefore, of this &s;ort, cannot be called evils, when we have no aver&s;ion to them, and do not repine at them. And if the&s;e be laid a|&s;ide, what may be ju&s;tly termed natural evils, will be reduced within a &s;mall compa&s;s. They will be found to proceed nece&s;&s;arily, and by an e&s;tabli&s;hed train of cau&s;es and ef|fects, either from the imperfection of our nature, or from the operation of general laws. Pain is not di&s;tributed through the world, blindly, or with any appearance of malice; but ends, proportions and mea|&s;ures, are ob&s;erved in the di&s;tribution. Sen|&s;ible marks of good tendency, are con&s;picu|ous, even in the har&s;he&s;t di&s;pen&s;ations of Pro|vidence, as well as in its general laws: and the good tendency of the&s;e general laws, is a &s;ure pledge of benevolence, even in tho&s;e in|&s;tances,
<PB N="370" REF="372">
where we may be at a lo&s;s about their application. One thing is certain, that there is in man, a natural principle to &s;ubmit to the&s;e general laws and their con&s;equences. And, were this principle cultivated, as it ought to be, mankind would have the &s;ame con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of rectitude of conduct, in &s;ubmitting to the laws of the natural world, that they have in &s;ubmitting to the laws of the moral world, and would as little repine at the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of the one kind, as at tho&s;e of the o|ther.</P>
<P>BUT we cannot do ju&s;tice to the argu|ment, unle&s;s we proceed further, to &s;how, that pain and di&s;tre&s;s are productive of mani|fold good ends, and that the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem could not well be without them. In the fir&s;t place, pain is nece&s;&s;ary, as a monitor of what is hurtful and dangerous to life. Every man is tru&s;ted with the care of his own pre&s;ervati|on; and he would be ill qualified for this tru&s;t, were he left entirely to the guidance of rea&s;on. He would die for want of food,
<PB N="371" REF="373">
were it not for the pain of hunger. And but for the pain ari&s;ing from fear, he would precipitate him&s;elf, every moment, into the mo&s;t de&s;tructive enterpri&s;es. In the next place, pain is the great &s;anction of laws, both human and divine. There would be no order nor di&s;cipline in the world, without it. In the third place, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments, which ari&s;e from the un|certainty of &s;ea&s;ons, from the variable tem|pers of tho&s;e we are connected with, and from other cro&s;s accidents, are wonderfully well adapted to our con&s;titution, by keeping our hopes and fears in perpetual agitation. Man is an active being, and is not in his ele|ment, but when in variety of occupation. A con&s;tant and uniform tenor of life, without hopes or fears, however agreeable in it&s;elf, would &s;oon bring on &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t. Pain therefore is nece&s;&s;ary, not only to en|hance our plea&s;ures, but to keep us in perpe|tual motion. And it is needle&s;s to ob&s;erve, a &s;econd time, that, to complain of man's con|&s;titution in this re&s;pect, is, in other words,
<PB N="372" REF="374">
to complain, that there is &s;uch a creature as man in the &s;cale of being. And to mention but one other thing, pain and di&s;tre&s;s have a wonderful tendency to advance the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety. Grief, compa&s;&s;ion and &s;ympathy, are &s;trong connecting principles, by which every particular man is made &s;ub&s;ervient to the general good of the whole &s;pecies.</P>
<P>I SHALL clo&s;e this branch of my &s;ubject with a general reflection, which is re&s;erved to the la&s;t place, becau&s;e, in my apprehen&s;i|on, it brings the argument for the benevo|lence of the Deity, within a very narrow compa&s;s. When we run over what we know of the formation and government of this world, the in&s;tances are without number, of good intention, and of con&s;ummate wi&s;dom, in adju&s;ting things to good ends and purpo|&s;es. And it is equally true, that, as we ad|vance in knowledge, &s;cenes of this kind mul|tiply upon us. This ob&s;ervation is enforced above. But I have now to ob&s;erve, that there is not a &s;ingle in&s;tance to be met with,
<PB N="373" REF="375">
which can be ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to malevolence or bad intention. Many evils may be point|ed out; evils at lea&s;t as to us. But when the mo&s;t is made of &s;uch in&s;tances, they ap|pear only to be the con&s;equences of general laws, which regard the whole more than par|ticulars; and therefore are no marks of ma|levolence in the author and governor of the world. Were there any doubt about the tendency of &s;uch in&s;tances, it would be more rational to a&s;cribe them to want of power, than want of benevolence, which is &s;o con|&s;picuous in other in&s;tances. But we can|not rationally a&s;cribe them to either, but to the pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed order and con&s;titution of things, and to the nece&s;&s;ary imperfection of the nature of all created beings. And, after all, laying the greate&s;t weight upon the&s;e na|tural evils, that can rea&s;onably be demand|ed, the accompt &s;tands thus. In&s;tances with|out number of benevolence, in the frame and government of this world, &s;o direct and clear, as not to admit of the &s;malle&s;t dubiety. On the other &s;ide, natural evils are &s;tated, which,
<PB N="374" REF="376">
at be&s;t, are very doubtful in&s;tances of male|volence, and may be a&s;cribed, perhaps ob|&s;curely, to another cau&s;e. In balancing this accompt, where the evil appearances are &s;o far out-numbered by the good, why &s;hould we he&s;itate a moment to a&s;cribe pure bene|volence to the Deity, and to conclude the&s;e evils to be nece&s;&s;ary defects in a good con&s;ti|tution; e&s;pecially when it is &s;o repugnant to our natural feelings, to a&s;cribe great benevo|lence, and great malevolence, to the &s;ame be|ing?</P>
<P>IT will be ob&s;erved, that in an&s;wering the above objection to the benevolence of the Deity, I have avoided urging any argument from our future exi&s;tence; tho' it affords a fruitful field of comfort, greatly overbalan|cing the tran&s;itory evils of this life. But I &s;hould &s;carce think it fair rea&s;oning, to urge &s;uch topics upon this &s;ubject; which would be arguing in a circle. Becau&s;e the benevo|lence of the Deity is the only &s;olid principle, from whence we can infer a future exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="377">
HAVING di&s;patched what occurred upon natural evil, we come now, to con&s;ider mo|ral evil as an objection again&s;t the benevo|lence of the Deity. And, &s;ome writers urge this objection &s;o far, as to conclude, that God is the cau&s;e of moral evil, &s;ince he has given man a con&s;titution, by which, moral evil, does, and mu&s;t abound. It is certainly no &s;atisfying an&s;wer to this objection, that moral evil is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of human liberty, when human liberty mu&s;t, at be&s;t, appear a doubtful fact. And even admitting of human liberty, it is a very po&s;|&s;ible &s;uppo&s;ition, that man might have been endued with a moral &s;en&s;e, &s;o lively and &s;trong, as to be ab&s;olutely authoritative over his actions. Waving, therefore, the argu|ment from human liberty, we mu&s;t look a|bout for a more &s;olid an&s;wer to the objection; which will not be difficult, when we con&s;i|der this matter, as laid down in a former e&s;|&s;ay <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay upon liberty and nece&s;&s;ity.</NOTE>. It is there made out, 'tis hoped to the &s;atisfaction of the reader, that human ac|tions,
<PB N="376" REF="378">
are, all of them, directed by general laws, which have an operation, not le&s;s in|fallible, than tho&s;e laws have, which govern mere matter; that the feeling we have of li|berty, does not corre&s;pond to the truth of things; and, that our peculiar manner of con|ceiving human actions, as right or wrong, and as prai&s;e or blame worthy, is wholly founded on this deceitful feeling. The final cau&s;e of this &s;ingular feeling, is al&s;o there laid open; that it is happily adju&s;ted to the na|ture of man, as an imperfect being, and tends to promote virtue in an eminent degree. This di&s;covery affords a &s;olid an&s;wer to an objec|tion, which, &s;o far as I know, has not hi|therto received any good an&s;wer. And it is, that the objection re&s;ts entirely upon a fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;ition, as if human actions were &s;een in the &s;ame light by the Deity, in which they are &s;een by men. A feeling, which is not agreeable to the truth of things, tho' wi&s;ely ordered to correct an imperfect con&s;ti|tution in man, cannot be a&s;cribed to a per|fect being. The Deity perceiving all things
<PB N="377" REF="379">
as they are, without di&s;gui&s;e, knows, that what is termed moral evil in the language of man, is, as well as moral good, the re&s;ult of general laws, and of a nece&s;&s;ary connection betwixt cau&s;es and their effects. Every thing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es its proper place in his plan. All our actions contribute equally to carry on the great and good de&s;igns of Providence; and, therefore, there is nothing which in his &s;ight is evil; at lea&s;t, nothing which is evil upon the whole.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING the objection in the a|bove light, which is the true one, it lo&s;es its force. For it certainly will not be maintain|ed as an argument again&s;t the goodne&s;s of the Deity, that he endued mankind with a &s;en&s;e of moral evil; which, in reality, is one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings be&s;towed upon him, and which eminently di&s;tingui&s;hes him from the brute creation.</P>
<P>BUT if, now, the objection be turned into another &s;hape, and it be demanded, Why was not every man endued with &s;o &s;trong a &s;en&s;e
<PB N="378" REF="380">
of morality, as to be completely authorita|tive over all his principles of action, which would prevent much remor&s;e to him&s;elf, and much mi&s;chief to others? It is an&s;wered, fir&s;t, that this would not be &s;ufficient for an exact regularity of conduct, unle&s;s man's judgment of right and wrong were al&s;o in|fallible. For, as long as we differ about what is <HI>yours,</HI> and what is <HI>mine,</HI> inju&s;tice mu&s;t be the con&s;equence, in many in&s;tances, however innocent we be. But, in the next place, to complain of a defect in the moral &s;en&s;e, is to complain, that we are not per|fect creatures. And, if this complaint be well founded, we may, with equal ju&s;tice, complain, that our under&s;tanding is but mo|derate, and that, in general, our powers and facultics are limited. Why &s;hould it be urg|ed as an objection, that the moral &s;en&s;e is imperfect, when all our &s;en&s;es, internal and external are imperfect? In &s;hort, if this com|plaint be, in any mea&s;ure, ju&s;t, it mu&s;t go the length, as above ob&s;erved, to prove, that it is not con&s;i&s;tent with the benevolence of the Deity, to create &s;uch a being as man.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>WE have thus gone through a variety of &s;ubjects, not without labour and expence of thought. And now, like a tra|veller, who, after examining the different parts of a country, a&s;cends &s;ome eminence to review the whole; let us refre&s;h our&s;elves, by looking back, and enjoying the di&s;cove|ries we have made.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject of the&s;e e&s;&s;ays is Man. We have formed no imaginary &s;chemes for ex|alting, or for depre&s;&s;ing his nature. The inquiry has been, whither his capacities and powers &s;uit his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, and fit him for acting a proper part in life. We begin with examining &s;ome of the great &s;prings of action. Upon accurate &s;crutiny, it is found, that &s;elf-love, or de&s;ire of good, is not our &s;ole principle of action; but, that we are furni&s;hed, be&s;ides, with a variety of impelling powers. Mingled in &s;ociety, for
<PB N="380" REF="382">
the convenience of mutual help, it is nece&s;|&s;ary, that we feel for each other. But as the feeling for another's &s;orrow, cannot but be painful; here is traced, an admirable con|trivance, to reconcile us to this virtuous pain; by taking off that aver&s;ion to pain, which, in all other ca&s;es, is an over-ruling principle. This explains a &s;eemingly &s;trange phaenome|non, that we &s;hould &s;eek entertainment, from repre&s;entations, which immer&s;e us in the deep|e&s;t affliction. From man as a &s;ocial, we pro|ceed to man as a moral agent. We find him &s;en&s;ible of beauty, in different ranks and or|ders; and eminently &s;en&s;ible of it, in its high|e&s;t order, that of &s;entiment, action and cha|racter. But the &s;en&s;e of moral beauty, is not alone &s;ufficient. The importance of morality requires &s;ome &s;tronger principle to guard it; &s;ome checks and re&s;traints from vice, more &s;evere than mere di&s;approbation. The&s;e are not wanting. To the &s;en&s;e of beauty, is &s;uperadded a &s;en&s;e of obligation; a feeling of <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong,</HI> which con&s;ti|tutes a law within us. This law enjoins
<PB N="381" REF="383">
the primary virtues, tho&s;e which are e&s;&s;en|tial to &s;ociety, under the &s;tricte&s;t &s;anctions. Pain, the &s;tronge&s;t monitor, is here employ|ed, to check tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: whil&s;t in the &s;ub|limer, more heroic parts of virtue, where &s;trict obligation ends, plea&s;ure is employed to reward the performance. To nothing are we prompted as a duty, for which we are not fir&s;t prepared, by &s;ome inward principle. An exact proportion is maintained betwixt the &s;trength of our internal principles, and their u&s;efulne&s;s. From &s;elf, the object of our mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential principles, affection &s;preads thro' all the connections we have with others, whether formed by natural ties, founded on gratitude, or created by &s;ympathy with the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; till, among per&s;ons indifferent and unknown, affection is gradually lo&s;t. Ar|rived at that point, where benevolence would vani&s;h by the di&s;tance of the object, nature has an admirable artifice for reviving its force; by directing it on the ab&s;tract idea of a Pub|lic and a Whole: which, tho' faint and ob|&s;cure in the conception, is yet equal to any
<PB N="382" REF="384">
of our ideas, in force and energy. Man is, in this manner, furni&s;hed for acting a proper and u&s;eful part, in the &s;y&s;tem to which he belongs. But this &s;y&s;tem could not be re|gulated upon any pre-adju&s;ted plan: the ac|tions of man could not proceed with any order, nor be &s;ubject to any government; un|le&s;s all were nece&s;&s;arily determined by mo|tives. At the &s;ame time, man could not well conceive him&s;elf to be a moral, without con|ceiving him&s;elf, al&s;o, to be a free, agent. Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of giving his mind a peculiar ca&s;t; in which, we cannot but di&s;cern the brighte&s;t characters of de&s;igning wi&s;dom. By having his practical ideas, and his moral feelings, form'd upon an imaginary &s;tate of liberty, con&s;cience exerts its power over him, with full authority; and &s;cope is gi|ven, for a far richer and more diver&s;ified &s;cene of action, than the perpetual con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of nece&s;&s;ity could have admitted. Having &s;hown, that morals are e&s;tabli&s;hed on an immovable foundation, we proceed to &s;how, by what inward powers we are led to
<PB N="383" REF="385">
the knowledge and belief of &s;ome of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary truths; particularly that which it mo&s;t imports us to know, the exi&s;tence of the Deity. To this we pave the way, by a full preparation of rea&s;oning. We fir&s;t con|&s;ider the nature of that act of the mind, which is termed <HI>belief;</HI> of which the immediate foundation is the te&s;timony of our &s;en&s;es. If the te&s;timony they give to the real exi&s;tence of a material world, be a mere illu&s;ion, as &s;ome have held, all belief founded on our own feelings, is at an end. Hence there ap|pears a nece&s;&s;ity for e&s;tabli&s;hing the authori|ty of our &s;en&s;es. And here we find full &s;a|tisfaction. For, in other ca&s;es, where there is any thing like artifice in the conduct of nature, means are afforded, both of di&s;cover|ing the truth, and of di&s;covering the end, for which artifice is made u&s;e of, to conceal the truth. She never deceives us in vain. But, in the ca&s;e of external exi&s;tences, we find nothing, after the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny, but pre|&s;umptions, hypothe&s;es and fallacious rea&s;on|ings, oppo&s;ed to the cleare&s;t te&s;timony, which
<PB N="384" REF="386">
nature can give. Di&s;per&s;ing with no great labour, that philo&s;ophic du&s;t, which &s;ceptics have rai&s;ed about material &s;ub&s;tance, we find it no more difficult to be conceived, than qualities; both being equally di&s;played to us, by a peculiar modification of the &s;en&s;e of &s;ight. But belief is not more &s;olidly founded upon our external &s;en&s;es, than upon our internal feelings. Not the greate&s;t &s;ceptic ever doubted of his own per&s;onal identity, continued thro' the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive periods of life; of his being the &s;ame man this year, he was the la&s;t: which, however, is a di&s;covery made by no rea&s;oning; re&s;ting wholly upon a &s;imple feeling, or inward &s;en&s;e and con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of the fact. Upon a like foundation re&s;ts our belief of cau&s;e and effect. No relation is more familiar, nor &s;ooner takes hold of the mind, than this. Yet certain it is, that no rea&s;oning, no experience, can di&s;cover the power or energy of what we term a cau&s;e, when we attempt to trace it to its &s;ource. It is nece&s;&s;ary for the well-being of man, fir&s;t, that he &s;hould perceive the objects, which ex|i&s;t
<PB N="385" REF="387">
around him; and next, that he &s;hould perceive them in their true &s;tate, not detach|ed and loo&s;e, but as cau&s;es and effects, as producing and produced. Nature has fur|ni&s;hed us with external &s;en&s;es for the percep|tion of objects, not only as &s;imply exi&s;ting, but as exi&s;ting thus related to each other. Nor, without &s;uch faculties, could we ever have attained the idea of cau&s;e and effect. The &s;ame provi&s;ion is made by nature, in an|other ca&s;e, not le&s;s remarkable than the for|mer. Our &s;en&s;es can only inform us of ob|jects as pre&s;ently exi&s;ting. Yet nothing is more common, than from our knowledge of the pre&s;ent, and our experience of the pa&s;t, to rea&s;on to the future. Now all rea|&s;onings about futurity, which have &s;uch ex|ten&s;ive influence on our conduct, would be utterly de&s;titute of a foundation, were we not endowed with a &s;en&s;e of uniformity and con&s;tancy in the operations of nature. A &s;e|cret in&s;tinct founds this conclu&s;ion, that the future will be like the pa&s;t. Thus there is e&s;tabli&s;hed, a marvelous harmony betwixt our inward feelings, and the cour&s;e of external
<PB N="386" REF="388">
events. In the above mentioned in&s;tances, we attribute to our boa&s;ted rea&s;on, what, in truth, is performed by &s;en&s;e or in&s;tinct. With|out knowing it to be &s;uch, we tru&s;t to it. We act upon its informations, with equal confi|dence, as we do upon the cleare&s;t conclu&s;i|ons of rea&s;on: and, in fact, it does not oft|ner deceive us. Nature thus mo&s;t effectu|ally provides for our in&s;truction, in things mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be known. But this is not all. We pur&s;ue the argument into a &s;ort of intuitive demon&s;tration of the Deity. He has not left us to collect his exi&s;tence from ab&s;tract or uncertain arguments; but has made us feel, that he exi&s;ts. When exter|nal objects are pre&s;ented to our view, &s;ome are immediately di&s;tingui&s;hed to be effects, not by any proce&s;s or deduction of rea|&s;oning, but merely by &s;ight, which gives us the perception of cau&s;e and effect. Ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner, this whole world is &s;een, or di&s;covered, to be an effect produced by &s;ome invi&s;ible de&s;igning cau&s;e. This argu|ment cannot be invalidated, without introdu|cing
<PB N="387" REF="389">
univer&s;al &s;ceptici&s;m; without overthrow|ing all that is built upon the feelings, which, in many capital in&s;tances, govern our judg|ments and actions; and without obliging us, to doubt of tho&s;e things, of which no man ever doubted. For, as in viewing an exter|nal object, a particular modification of the &s;en&s;e of &s;ight, includes the idea of &s;ub&s;tance, as well as of quality; as a natural feeling makes us conceive &s;ome things as effects, to be a&s;cribed to a proper cau&s;e; as, from expe|rience of the pa&s;t, in&s;tinct prompts us to judge of the future; in fine, as, by the feel|ing of identity, the reader is con&s;cious of be|ing the &s;ame per&s;on he was when he began to read: as all the&s;e conclu&s;ions, I &s;ay, upon which mankind re&s;t with the fulle&s;t a&s;&s;u|rance, are the dictates of &s;en&s;es external and internal; in the very &s;ame way, and upon the &s;ame evidence, we conclude the exi&s;tence of a fir&s;t Supreme Cau&s;e. Rea&s;on, when applied to, gives us all its aid, both to confirm the cer|tainty of his being, and to di&s;cover his per|fections. From effects &s;o great, and &s;o good,
<PB N="388" REF="390">
as tho&s;e we &s;ee through the univer&s;e, we ne|ce&s;&s;arily infer the cau&s;e to be both great and good. Mixed or imperfect qualities cannot belong to him. The difficulties from appa|rent evil, are found capable of a &s;atisfactory &s;olution. All the general laws of the uni|ver&s;e, are confe&s;&s;edly wi&s;e and good. Pain is found not to be u&s;eful only, but nece&s;&s;ary in the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem. If this be an argu|ment of an imperfect &s;tate, yet mu&s;t it not be admitted, that, &s;omewhere in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence, an imperfect order of beings mu&s;t be found? And why not man &s;uch a being? unle&s;s we extravagantly demand, that, to prove the benevolence of the Deity, all the po&s;&s;ible orders of being &s;hould be advanced to the top of the &s;cale, and all be left void and wa&s;te below: no life, no exi&s;tence allowed, except what is perfect. The more of nature is explored and known, the le&s;s of evil appears. New di&s;coveries, of wi&s;dom, order and good intention, have always kept pace with increa&s;|ing learning and knowledge: an intimation, not ob&s;cure, of its being owing to our im|perfect
<PB N="389" REF="391">
di&s;coveries and bounded views, that evil is &s;uppo&s;ed to take place at all. Now, when we con&s;ider all the&s;e things in one view; &s;o many &s;triking in&s;tances of final cau&s;es; &s;uch undeniable proofs both of wi&s;e de&s;ign, and skilful execution; in place of in|dulging cold di&s;tru&s;t of the great univer&s;al cau&s;e, are we not rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t admi|ration! Is there not &s;omewhat in this &s;ubject, that has power to kindle a noble enthu&s;i|a&s;m? And that will ju&s;tify us for attempting a higher &s;train?</P>
<P><Q>For do not all the&s;e wonders, <HI>O Eternal Mind!</HI> Sovereign Architect of all! form a hymn to thy prai&s;e? If in the dead inani|mate works of nature, thou art &s;een; if in the verdure of the fields, and the azure of the skies, the ignorant ru&s;tic admires thy creative power; how blind mu&s;t that man be, who, looking into his own nature, contemplating this living &s;tructure, this moral frame, di&s;cerns not thy forming hand? What various and complicated ma|chinery
<PB N="390" REF="392">
is here! and regulated with what exqui&s;ite art! Whil&s;t man pur&s;ues happi|ne&s;s as his chief aim, thou bende&s;t &s;elf-love into the &s;ocial direction. Thou in|fu&s;e&s;t the generous principle, which makes him feel for &s;orrows not his own: nor feels he only, but, &s;trange indeed! takes delight in ru&s;hing into foreign mi&s;ery; and, with plea&s;ure, goes to drop the pain|ful tear, over real or imaginary woes. Thy divine hand, thus &s;trongly, drew the connecting tye, and linked man to man, by a &s;ympathetic power; that nothing might be &s;olitary or de&s;olate in thy world; but all tend and work toward mutual a&s;|&s;ociation. For this great end, he is not left to a loo&s;e or arbitrary range of will. Thy wi&s;e decree hath erected within him a throne for virtue. There, thou ha&s;t not decked her with beauty only, to his admiring eye; but thrown around her, the awful effulgence of authority divine. Her per&s;ua&s;ions have the force of a pre|cept; and her precepts are a law indi&s;pen|&s;ible.
<PB N="391" REF="393">
Man feels him&s;elf bound by this law, &s;trict and immutable: and yet the pri|vilege of &s;upererogating is left; a field o|pened for free and generous action; in which, performing a glorious cour&s;e, he may attain the high reward, by thee al|lotted, of inward honour and &s;elf-e&s;ti|mation. Nothing is made &s;uperfluou&s;|ly &s;evere, nothing left dangerou&s;ly loo&s;e, in thy moral in&s;titution; but every active principle made to know its proper place. In ju&s;t proportion, man's affection diver|ges from him&s;elf to objects around him. Where the diverging rays, too widely &s;cat|tered, begin to lo&s;e their warmth; collect|ing them again by the idea of a public, a country, or the univer&s;e, thou rekindle&s;t the dying flame. Converging eagerly to this point, behold how inten&s;e they glow! and man, tho' indifferent to each remote particular, burns with zeal for the whole. All things are by thee pre-ordained, great Mover of all! Throughout the wide ex|pan&s;e, every living creature runs a de&s;tin|ed
<PB N="392" REF="394">
cour&s;e. Whil&s;t all, under a law irre|&s;i&s;tible, fulfil thy decrees, man alone &s;eems to him&s;elf exempt; free to turn and bend his cour&s;e at will. Yet is he not exempt: but, under the impre&s;&s;ion of freedom, mi|ni&s;ters, in every action, to thy decree om|niponent, as much as the rolling &s;un, or ebbing flood. What &s;trange contradic|tions are, in thy great &s;cheme, reconciled! what glaring oppo&s;ites made to agree! Nece&s;&s;ity and liberty meet in the &s;ame a|gent, yet interfere not. He imagines him&s;elf free, yet is under the bonds of nece&s;&s;ity. He di&s;covers him&s;elf to be a nece&s;&s;ary agent, and yet continues to act as he were free. Within the heart of man, thou ha&s;t placed thy lamp, to direct his otherways uncertain &s;teps. By this light, he is not only a&s;&s;ured of the exi&s;|tence, and entertained with all the glo|ries of the material world, but is enabl|ed to penetrate into the rece&s;&s;es of nature. He perceives objects joined together by the my&s;terious link of cau&s;e and effect.
<PB N="393" REF="395">
The connecting principle, tho' he can ne|ver explain, he is made to feel, and is thus in&s;tructed, how to refer even Things unknown, to their proper origin. Nay, he is taught by thee, to prophe&s;y Things to come. Where rea&s;on is unavailing, in&s;tinct comes in aid, and be&s;tows a pow|er of divination, which di&s;covers the fu|ture, by the pa&s;t. Thus, thou gradually lifte&s;t him up to the knowledge of thy|&s;elf. The plain and &s;imple &s;en&s;e, which, in the mo&s;t obvious effect, reads and per|ceives a cau&s;e, brings him &s;treight to thee, the fir&s;t great cau&s;e, the antient of days, the eternal &s;ource of all. Thou pre&s;ent|e&s;t thy&s;elf to us, and we cannot avoid thee. We mu&s;t doubt of our own exi&s;tence, if we call in que&s;tion thine. We &s;ee thee by thine own light. We &s;ee thee, not exi&s;ting only, but in wi&s;dom and in bene|volence &s;upreme, as in exi&s;tence, fir&s;t. As &s;pots in the &s;un's bright orb, &s;o in the u|niver&s;al plan, &s;cattered evils are lo&s;t in the blaze of &s;uperabundant goodne&s;s. Even,

by the re&s;earch of human rea&s;on, weak as it is, tho&s;e &s;eeming evils dimini&s;h and fly away apace. Objects, &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uperflu|ous or noxious, have a&s;&s;umed a beneficial a&s;pect. How much more, to thine all pe|netrating eye, mu&s;t all appear excellent and fair! It mu&s;t be &s;o. We cannot doubt. Neither imperfection nor malice dwell with thee.
