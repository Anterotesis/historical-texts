<HEAD>MEMOIRS
OF SOME
TRANSACTIONS
DURING
The late MINISTRY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>VVHEN there is &s;uch a
general Expectation of
&s;ome great Matter to
be made appear again&s;t
the Per&s;on the&s;e Sheets relate to; and
much Pains is taken to calumniate
and mi&s;repre&s;ent him to the World;
it may not be ami&s;s to give the
World &s;ome true State of his Ca&s;e,
that none may be impos'd upon thro'
Ignorance, how far &s;oever Malice
may carry &s;ome.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">
The Matter draws towards a Cri|&s;is;
the Que&s;tion will &s;oon be tran&s;|ferr'd,
from between Party and Par|ty,
to a Bar of Ju&s;tice; and the
Blood of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobleman is to
be the Subject of the Pleadings and
Defence.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> &s;eems to re&s;olve
to appear, and to &s;tand in his own
Defence. I advance one thing with|out
Doors in Defence of his Ca&s;e in
general, before the Particulars come
to be enquired into. If it be ju&s;t to
&s;ay of my Lord <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> that he
knows him&s;elf to be guilty, why el&s;e
did he fly? It will be as rea&s;onable to
&s;ay of my Lord of <HI>Oxford,</HI> he is &s;atis|fied
in his own Innocence, why el&s;e
does he &s;tay?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Opinion his Lord&s;hip
has of his own Innocence, it mu&s;t
be acknowledg'd, his Lord&s;hip pays
the greate&s;t Honour to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Nobility that is po&s;&s;ible to do, and
perhaps more than was ever done
before; that however the Turns of
<PB N="3" REF="4">
the Government &s;ince his Admini|&s;tration,
may have given Impre&s;&s;ions
of things very different from what
were in his Time; and as it might
be &s;ugge&s;ted, very much to his Di&s;|advantage;
nay, however Intere&s;t
may &s;eeem to run, even in a very
&s;trong Stream again&s;t him; yet that
he pays &s;uch a profound Re&s;pect to
the un&s;potted Honour of the Peer|age,
as to ca&s;t his Life into their
Hands, at a Time when Thoughts
le&s;s generous might be apt to en|tertain
&s;ome Fears of the Impre&s;&s;ions,
which Party might have made on
the Minds of the Nobility, at a
Time when it is &s;carce to be &s;aid,
that any other Sett of Men in the
Nation are entirely free.</P>
<P>Either my L. <HI>O</HI>&mdash;mu&s;t have
&s;ome &s;urprizing Evidence in him&s;elf
of his own Innocence; and not only
&s;o, but of his being able to &s;et that
Innocence in a clear Light to the
World; or el&s;e he makes the great|e&s;t
Compliment to the Nobility of
<HI>Britain</HI> that ever Man made. He
&s;uppo&s;es their Lord&s;hips untainted
<PB N="4" REF="5">
with the Prejudice of the Times; and
that nothing can byafs their Minds,
nothing artfully prepo&s;&s;e&s;s their Judg|ments;
that they cannot be blind|ed
by any humane Infirmities, mov|ed
by any Pa&s;&s;ions, impo&s;ed upon
by the Per&s;wa&s;ions, or affected by
private Views of any kind; that
they cannot be hurry'd by popular
Winds or Storms, from whatever
Corner they may blow, whether of
Faction, Tumult, Envy, or Ambi|tion:
But that they will move in a
direct Path of Ju&s;tice, guided by
Truth, without the lea&s;t Deviation
or Inclination one Way or other, ei|ther
from Parties, Per&s;ons, Intere&s;t,
or Power, of any kind what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, his Lord&s;hip &s;eems to
pay a mo&s;t dutiful and honourable
Regard to the per&s;onal Ju&s;tice, Cle|mency,
and Honour of His Maje&s;ty;
declaring, by thus putting him&s;elf on
his Trial, at &s;uch a Juncture as this,
that he firmly depends upon His
Maje&s;ty's Royal Virtue; that nothing
will, on the King's Part, be offered
or encouraged to bya&s;s, or lead to
<PB N="5" REF="6">
awe, or any Way influence the Judg|ment
that &s;hall be given in his Ca&s;e;
that &s;hall not &s;o much as be ima|gined,
that the Votes of the Peers,
one Way or other, &s;hall in the lea&s;t
affect them in their Intere&s;t, or in
the Favour of His Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that in
this his Lord&s;hip acts from a Prin|ciple
of great Ju&s;tice and Duty, as
well to His Maje&s;ty, as to the Hou&s;e
of Peers; and no Man can &s;ay, with|out
manife&s;t Injury to his Maje&s;ty,
or to that Honourable Hou&s;e, that
he &s;o much as believes his Lord&s;hip
will be the wor&s;t treated for that
dutiful and generous Behaviour.</P>
<P>Without Doors we cannot &s;ay it
will be the &s;ame; it were to be
wi&s;hed, the People, who &s;hew &s;uch
a Warmth in their De&s;ires to bring
on the Trial of this Lord, would
&s;hew the like Di&s;po&s;ition to having
him fairly acquitted, if his Innocence
&s;hall appear, as they &s;eem to &s;hew
for his De&s;truction, on a Pre&s;umption
of his Guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">
It is now come to the great Que|&s;tion:
Nothing le&s;s than his Life,
or his Death, is the Ca&s;e. If we
were to make a Judgment of him
by the Opinions and Tempers of Men
without Doors, it would be ea&s;y to
conclude, what &s;hould be his Fate;
and his Courage mu&s;t be thought
greater than his Di&s;cretion, to put
him&s;elf upon his Tryal; which
makes the Honour done to the Ju|&s;tice
and Impartiality of His Maje&s;ty,
and the Peers, of which mention is
made already, be the greater.</P>
<P>Yet we would hope, that &s;eeing it
is now brought this length, Men
will begin to be more &s;erious, and
forbear to importune the Ju&s;tice
of the Nation, by their Invectives,
and indecent Treatment: My Lord
has appealed from the Clamours of
the People, to the Ju&s;tice and Ho|nour
of the Peers; and being thus
in the Hands of Ju&s;tice, what is there
that Men can de&s;ire more? They
who occupy their Pens or Tongues,
now to blacken, defame, or reproach
<PB N="7" REF="8">
him, openly challenge the Hou&s;e of
Peers, reproach their Ju&s;tice, and
villify that Augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly, as if
not di&s;po&s;ed to do Ju&s;tice in the
Ca&s;e when it comes before them:
As his Lord&s;hip has thrown him&s;elf
upon the Honour and Ju&s;tice of the
Peers, and put his Life and Honour
into their Lord&s;hips Hands; &s;o
&s;hould we do, and not either lead
or direct them, which would be, in
the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Manner, to &s;u&s;pect their
Proceedings.</P>
<P>The Clamours which have hither|to
been made on this Account, have
been, as the Authors pretended, on|ly
to have Men impeached; and we
have &s;een Writers tell the Govern|ment,
<HI>They expect it:</HI> It is now done,
we hope they will be &s;atisfy'd, and
not tell the Hou&s;e of Peers, whether
they &s;hall acquit or condemn: This
mu&s;t be left in their own Brea&s;ts;
and there is no Doubt but they will
act as Ju&s;tice, and their own Honour,
&s;hall direct; and of this we mu&s;t all
wait the I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">
That we may attend this great
Event with le&s;s Curio&s;ity and Im|patience,
it may be proper to &s;tate
the Facts of this noble Lord's Con|duct,
as they appear at pre&s;ent in
tho&s;e very Ca&s;es wherein he is &s;o
much impugned and attack'd, that
when People have cool Thoughts
about them, they may be di&s;po&s;ed
to read them over; perhaps when
they have done &s;o, they will be the
backwarder to blame the Hou&s;e of
Peers, if they &s;hould not find it as
they may expect.</P>
<P>In the latter End of King <HI>William</HI>'s
Reign, we found Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> cho&s;en
Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons.
He was, in the Se&s;&s;ion before, one of
tho&s;e Members, who &s;tood firm to the
Re&s;olution of disbanding the Army;
having always an Opinion, that the
Security of the Prince was &s;ufficient|ly
provided for in the Affection of
his faithful Commons; and that all
the Dangers, which, as was then
pretended, appeared from the grow|ing
Power of <HI>France,</HI> were far le&s;s,
<PB N="9" REF="10">
and ea&s;ier to be &s;truggled with, in
any Incident which might happen,
than tho&s;e which might proceed from
a &s;tanding Force of Mercenaries, to
be kept up in Time of Peace; by
which very thing this Kingdom had
more than once been in great Dan|ger
of having her Liberty over|whelmed,
and the wor&s;t of Slavery
entailed upon her; and that there|fore
the War being over, the Nation
ought to take effectual Care of their
own Liberties; and to limit the
Number of the Forces to &s;uch, and no
more, as might be thought &s;ufficient
for the publick Safety.</P>
<P>It was not altogether &s;o agreeable to
His Maje&s;ty's Thoughts at that Time,
as could have been wi&s;h'd; and e|&s;pecially
the Regiment of <HI>Dutch</HI>
Guards were exceedingly de&s;ired by
the King; but it could not be: The
Members declar'd, That it was not
from a Jealou&s;y or Di&s;re&s;pect for the
Per&s;on of His Maje&s;ty, who, they
were throughly &s;atisfied, would nei|ther
him&s;elf, or by his Permi&s;&s;ion,
ever &s;uffer an Army to oppre&s;s them;
<PB N="10" REF="11">
but that the Precedent would be
dangerous to Po&s;terity, when the
Succe&s;&s;ors of His Maje&s;ty might,
perhaps, make a fatal U&s;e of that
Advantage, of which he would make
no Advantage at all.</P>
<P>It was reported at that Time,
that Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> was cho&s;en again&s;t
the Mea&s;ures of the Court; and that
the King was di&s;obliged by him to
the la&s;t Degree, on Account of the
afore&s;aid breaking of the Forces. But
His Maje&s;ty him&s;elf removed the
Scandal of that Rumour, by a&s;&s;uring
Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> that he was very well
&s;atisfy'd with him; and indeed the
Principles upon which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Gentlemen went at that Time, were
&s;o evidently e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;erving
their Liberties, that the King him&s;elf,
who was a great Patron of Liberty,
was perfectly &s;atisfy'd with the thing
afterwards; and likewi&s;e with the
Per&s;ons, expre&s;&s;ing a very particular
E&s;teem for Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> to the Time
of his Death, which happened &s;oon
after.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
At the Acce&s;&s;ion of the Queen to
the Crown, Her Maje&s;ty was plea&s;|ed
to chu&s;e Her Mini&s;try among a
Sett of Men, who, there was &s;ome
Rea&s;on to have expected other Con|duct
from them to Her Maje&s;ty, at
lea&s;t the Queen expected it; but
they who knew them better, were
not &s;o much di&s;appointed in them as
Her Maje&s;ty was.</P>
<P>It imports not to record their Fail|ings
farther than thus; to let Po&s;te|rity
know, they began to precipitate
the Crown, in many Ca&s;es, to a Degree
that mu&s;t, in Time, have been fatal.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e Ca&s;es Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> &s;ig|nalized
him&s;elf, by that famous Stand
which he made in Behalf of the Li|berties
of his Country; of which
tho&s;e who &s;hared in the Advantage
cannot entirely forget the Particu|lars.
Tho&s;e who were neare&s;t the
<HI>Queen,</HI> and mo&s;t faithful to Her In|tere&s;t,
finding the Influence he had
in the Hou&s;e, was of u&s;e to them on
many Accounts, began, about this
<PB N="12" REF="13">
Time, to &s;ee he was a Per&s;on nece&s;|&s;ary
to keep a clo&s;er Corre&s;pondence
with; and having found the <HI>Queen</HI>
of the &s;ame Opinion, he was receiv|ed
into the Cabinet Mea&s;ures, and
the nice&s;t Affairs communicated to
him.</P>
<P>In this Station he obtain'd, upon
the Opinion not only of the Per&s;ons
who he nece&s;&s;arily was embark'd
with; as the late E. of <HI>Godolphin,</HI> the
Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;and &s;ome others;
but of the <HI>Queen</HI> more e&s;pecially,
who, with my L. <HI>Godolphin,</HI> had a
&s;ingular E&s;teem for him.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y for Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> in this
Scituation, to convince Her Maje&s;ty,
of the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity She was in,
of changing Her Mea&s;ures, and of
di&s;mi&s;&s;ing a furious Faction, who
began to be odious to the People, by
their pu&s;hing the Government upon
&s;uch things as tended to embroil Her
Maje&s;ty with Her be&s;t Subjects; and
make the War abroad, which was
then newly entred into, be either
impracticable, or un&s;ucce&s;sful, by
<PB N="13" REF="14">
rea&s;on of the Di&s;contents at Home,
which were ri&s;ing to a great Height
among the People, and &s;ometimes
between the Two Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In the Pur&s;uit of this Council, the
Advantage whereof the whole King|dom
feels to this Day, the <HI>Queen</HI> was
plea&s;ed to di&s;mi&s;s Sir <HI>Edward Sey|mour</HI>'s
Party, &s;o they were call'd, and
fill up the Hou&s;hold with &s;uch a Mi|ni&s;try,
as the pre&s;ent Age pretends to
be very well &s;atisfy'd in; the prime
Mini&s;try, as it is call'd, re&s;ting in
the late Lord Trea&s;urer <HI>Godolphin;</HI>
the Army, in the D. of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;<HI>h;</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> was made Secretary of
State, in the Room of the E. of
<HI>N</HI>&mdash;<HI>m;</HI> Sir <HI>Charles Hedges</HI>
keeping the Seals as the other Secre|tary
of State, as he was before.</P>
<P>Thus the Introduction of that
Mini&s;try was the Work of Mr. <HI>Har|ley;</HI>
and it was to his Coun&s;els that
they ow'd their being e&s;tabli&s;hed in
the full Admini&s;tration of Affairs;
which, whil&s;t they carry'd on with
Unanimity of Councils, and without
<PB N="14" REF="15">
Jealou&s;y of one another, were admi|ni&s;tred
with great Satisfaction to Her
Maje&s;ty, and all Her People at
Home, as well as with glorious Suc|ce&s;&s;es
abroad; during this Time,
the Animo&s;ities among the good
People began exceedingly to abate;
the Remembrances of <HI>Occa&s;ional Bills,
Tackings,</HI> &amp;c. wore much off of the
Minds of the People, and the Court
generally di&s;couraging the Breaches
among the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Subjects; an open
and free Admini&s;tration was carry'd
on, by which Room was left for all
Her Maje&s;ty's Subjects, of whatever
Party, to re&s;tore them&s;elves to Her
Favour, by their Merit; and to wipe
out the Remembrances of any Mi&s;car|riages,
by a future dutiful Behaviour.
A Method of Government exceedingly
agreeable to the <HI>Queen,</HI> as it would,
had it gone on, have been, in Time,
healing to the Nation.</P>
<P>But this happy Scheme was not a|like
plea&s;ing to all; and &s;ome, who
had Cravings in Nature to &s;atisfy,
which were not &s;o con&s;i&s;tent with
this di&s;intere&s;ted Manner of Manage|ment,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
began to be unea&s;y at the
Apprehen&s;ions of letting in the Mob,
as it was call'd, into their Affairs.
The Intere&s;t in Her Maje&s;ty, which,
as it was call'd, was not a thing of
&s;o little Value to be laid open, and
Her Favour and Confidence to be
made Common to the People:
They found that as they had made
it a Property, &s;o their Succe&s;s gave
them an Advantage above all that
went before them, by &s;eeming to
make them&s;elves nece&s;&s;ary to Her
Maje&s;ty: This Point was carried
on to &s;uch an Extremity, the Sweet|ne&s;s
of governing, even their Sove|reign,
alluring, that finding Mr.
<HI>Harley</HI> inflexible; and that he would
not join in &s;uch narrow Mea&s;ures;
but de&s;ir'd, that the <HI>Queen</HI> might
Reign for Her &s;elf, and all Her Sub|jects
have Acce&s;s to Her; that She
might be fully apprized of all Her
Affairs; and act as well by Know|ledge
as Advice: Finding this was
the Scheme he had laid; and
that it was directly oppo&s;ite to their
own, and would, in the End, over|throw
it: They from that Time
<PB N="16" REF="17">
entred into Mea&s;ures either to &s;up|plant
him in Her Maje&s;ty's Favour,
or in his Employment.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, notwith&s;tanding many
Mi&s;repre&s;entations and mean Steps
taken, they could not effect; the la&s;t,
they brought to pa&s;s for a Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>It &s;eems that they brought the la&s;t
to pa&s;s with Difficulty; and it was
evident to them, as al&s;o to others,
that as her Maje&s;ty parted not with
Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> without great Reluctance;
&s;o that altho' he was di&s;mi&s;s'd from
the Office of her principal Secretary,
that yet he had acce&s;s to her Per&s;on,
and had opportunity to communicate
&s;uch Councils as occa&s;ion offer'd, ha|ving
the Honour, from that time, of a
Confidence with his Sovereign, which
tho&s;e, who had Power to di&s;place him,
had then no Share in.</P>
<P>This Favour of his Prince was
much encrea&s;ed by &s;ome foul things
which had been di&s;cover'd to her Ma|je&s;ty
to have been practi&s;ed upon him,
in order to render him &s;u&s;pected to
<PB N="17" REF="18">
be concern'd in the Trea&s;on of Mr.
<HI>Gregg,</HI> and more e&s;pecially by &s;ome
Steps which were privately taken by
&s;ome Per&s;ons, in order, by Fear of
Death, or Hope of Mercy, to induce
the &s;aid <HI>Gregg,</HI> when under Sentence
of Death, to accu&s;e Mr. <HI>Harley;</HI> and
as her Maje&s;ty receiv'd the Account
of tho&s;e De&s;igns with Tokens of great
Di&s;plea&s;ure, and even of Dete&s;tation;
&s;o the Declaration which the Crimi|nal
gave, even ju&s;t before his Executi|on,
of the Innocence of Mr. <HI>Harley&punc;</HI> as
it was a particular Satisfaction to the
Queen, &s;o it confirm'd the Opinion
her Maje&s;ty had conceived of Mr.
<HI>Harley,</HI> as a Per&s;on proper to be en|tru&s;ted,
and fit to be employed in her
Service.</P>
<P>It might have been u&s;eful to have
de&s;cended to the Particulars of this
Matter, and to the Per&s;ons likewi&s;e,
but another time may be thought
more proper; this &s;uffices to &s;hew,
that there was at that time a horrid
Con&s;piracy again&s;t the Life of this
noble Lord; how far it has been car|ried
on, or revived &s;ince&punc; and whe|ther
<PB N="18" REF="19">
it be by the &s;ame Hands or not,
will likewi&s;e appear, the Time being
approaching, when there may be rea&s;on
to lay the blacke&s;t part of this Tran&s;|action
open to the View of the Sun.</P>
<P>Mean time, it is worth notice, that
as the Per&s;ons concerned would not
have failed to have accepted the E|vidence
of Mr. <HI>Gregg</HI> again&s;t Mr.
<HI>Harley,</HI> if he had either known any
thing whereof to accu&s;e him, or had
been prevailed with to have forged
any Accu&s;ation, in order to have &s;a|ved
his Life; yet &s;ome of them were
not backward to depretiate the dy|ing
Words of the &s;ame Man, when it
appeared they tended to clear the
Per&s;on, who they de&s;ired rather &s;hould
have been accu&s;ed; di&s;covering thereby
&s;uch a Partiality as her Maje&s;ty was
plea&s;ed to take notice of, to be as cri|minal
in its Degree, as the De&s;ign
afore&s;aid again&s;t his Life. <HI>It's &s;trange,</HI>
&s;aid &s;he once upon that Occa&s;ion, <HI>that
they would not have us believe the Man
now he acquits Mr.</HI> Harley, <HI>when they
would have believed him if he had accu|&s;ed
him;</HI> and <HI>that they will not believe the
<PB N="19" REF="20">
Man's dying Words, when it is evident
they would have laid great Weight upon
them if he had lived;</HI> her Maje&s;ty was
plea&s;ed likewi&s;e many times, when
this Affair was, upon any Occa&s;ion,
mention'd to her, to expre&s;s her Con|cern,
that any Methods &s;o unchri&s;tian
and unju&s;t &s;hould be taken by Per&s;ons
&s;o near Her, to de&s;troy an innocent
Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Yet could not this put a Stop to the
Enemies of Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> who, it &s;eems,
were re&s;tle&s;s in their own Scituation,
while they ob&s;erved his to be &s;o near
her Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on as would, upon
all Occa&s;ions, interrupt the farther
De&s;igns which they had calculated for
their own Advantage, in being &s;ingle
and uninterrupted in the Admini&s;tra|tion;
and therefore, tho' they could
not impo&s;e upon her Maje&s;ty in the
Ca&s;e above-mention'd of Mr. <HI>Gregg,</HI>
they left not any Stone unturn'd to
keep the People of their own Party
deceived, and to have it, by Pamphlet-Writings,
and private Emi&s;&s;aries,
&s;ugge&s;ted throughout the Kingdom,
that Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> was guilty of <HI>Gregg</HI>'s
<PB N="20" REF="21">
Trea&s;on, tho' nothing could be pro|ved
that ever ju&s;tified &s;o much as a
Su&s;picion. And altho' <HI>Gregg</HI> him&s;elf,
who could never have been convi|cted
but by his own Confe&s;&s;ion,
had been induced by Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> to
make that Confe&s;&s;ion; &s;o that Mr.
<HI>Harley</HI> &s;eemed that way to have been
the very In&s;trument of detecting him
more fully, and by con&s;equence of
his Death; a Provocation &s;ufficient to
make any one expect, that if he could
have &s;aved his Life at Mr. <HI>Harley</HI>'s
Expence, he would have made no
Difficulty of the Exchange, and not a
little the Rea&s;on of that <HI>low Step</HI> &s;ome
Per&s;ons (otherwi&s;e Per&s;ons of Honour)
took to bring it to pa&s;s, which it may
be believed they would not for their
own Sakes have been &s;een in, if they
had thought it could have failed of
Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>But <HI>Gregg,</HI> tho' a Traytor, would
not be a Murtherer. Whether they
were not &s;o, who endeavoured to make
him &s;o, will be tryed at another Tri|bunal.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">
As the&s;e things concurr'd to improve
that Intere&s;t which Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> had
in her Maje&s;ty's Favour, &s;o it made
way for, and not a little contributed
to the Breaches which followed, and
the Impre&s;&s;ions they made in her
Maje&s;ty, in Prejudice of tho&s;e Men
who were concern'd, were &s;uch as
were not ea&s;ily wiped out. Her Ma|je&s;ty,
who was a Prince&s;s of exceed|ing
Piety, believing that Men, who
could &s;toop to &s;uch wicked, and even
bloody Methods, to remove a Per&s;on
out of the Way of their Admini&s;tra|tion;
would &s;tick at few things that
could occur, and were ill qualify'd to
bring about the Ble&s;&s;ing of Her
Reign, in the Felicity of Her Peo|ple,
which was Her utmo&s;t De&s;ire.</P>
<P>But things were not yet brought
to Maturity, nor the Grievance of
the Admini&s;tration come to its Height;
and &s;everal things were yet to hap|pen,
which &s;hould concur with the
Impre&s;&s;ions Her Maje&s;ty had re|ceived
before, to le&s;&s;en the Plea&s;ure
She took in the Services of &s;ome a|bout
<PB N="22" REF="23">
Her; and, con&s;equently, make
Way for their Remove: But as
the&s;e do not concern Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> they
&s;hall be no otherwi&s;e mentioned, than
as they &s;erved to introduce the Re|volution
which followed.</P>
<P>It was in the Year 1708. when
Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> was di&s;mi&s;s'd from the
Office of <HI>Secretary of State;</HI> and Mr.
<HI>Boyle,</HI> now Lord <HI>Carleton,</HI> &s;ucceeded
him in that Place; a mode&s;t inoffen&s;ive
Gentleman, and concerned neither
one way or other in the Brigues above|mentioned.
And now it was thought
they who had the Admini&s;tration
would have gone on in their Bu&s;ine&s;s
without any Interruption, that they
had none to di&s;turb them, but that he,
who, they pretended, would have
&s;upplanted them, being laid a&s;ide, they
were out of Danger; and it may be
&s;aid of them, that they were weak
enough to think thus them&s;elves; but
they &s;oon found them&s;elves deceived,
and that the very Per&s;ons, who had
pu&s;h'd them upon the Breach with
Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> on pretence of &s;upplanting
them with the Queen, were in a
<PB N="23" REF="24">
&s;trong Confederacy or Plot to &s;up|plant
them with the People, and by
the Con&s;equence thereof with the
Queen; and wanted nothing, but to
remove Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> from them, to
make way for the Execution of their
De&s;ign, as the Per&s;on, who&s;e Inter|e&s;t
in the Queen, as well as his Capa|city
to di&s;appoint them, they, above
all other, thought to be dangerous to
them.</P>
<P>It is with the more Rea&s;on that it
is &s;aid, they thought, by the Con&s;e|quence
of &s;upplanting the Mini&s;try,
they &s;hould effectually &s;upplant them
with the Queen; becau&s;e, having
made the Experiment in the Ca&s;e of
Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> that the Queen might be
prevailed on by their new Method
of treating her Maje&s;ty to part with
Mini&s;ters, tho' She was not di&s;&s;atis|fied
with them; they concluded they
might take the &s;ame Method, and
bring her Maje&s;ty to the Nece&s;&s;ity,
&s;o they undutifully called it, of part|ing
with others: And that this is
true in Fact, that this was their
View at that Time, is proved by a
<PB N="24" REF="25">
Letter, written by a noble Lord then
in the Mini&s;try, who, when their
Plot broke out, had the Weakne&s;s,
or Want of Decency, to write a Let|ter
to the D&mdash;of <HI>R</HI>&mdash;into
<HI>Scotland,</HI> wherein he treats her Ma|je&s;ty
and Mini&s;try both in the Words
following: <Q REND="inline">'I would not have you be
bullied by the Court-Party; for the
Queen her &s;elf cannot &s;upport that
Faction long.'</Q></P>
<P>This was &s;trange Language from
a Secretary of State actually in Office,
and eminently di&s;covered, that the
Charge publickly laid again&s;t Mr.
<HI>Harley,</HI> of a De&s;ign to &s;upplant the
Mini&s;try, &s;hould have been laid on
another Hand, who now publickly
viewed a De&s;ign, not only of &s;up|planting
the Mini&s;try, who he called
a Faction, but of bringing the
Queen into &s;uch a Condition as not
to be able to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>It became &s;oon evident, that the
Per&s;ons, who this noble Lord called
a Faction, were no other than the late
Earl of <HI>Godolphin,</HI> and his Grace the
<PB N="25" REF="26">
D&mdash;of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;. The One at that
Time at the Head of the Army, the
Other of the Trea&s;ury, as by their
farther open Declarations in the Ele|ction
of the next Parliament appear|ed,
in which the Juncto to the Whig-Noble-Men,
embarkt in this De&s;ign,
were called, openly joined with the
male-contented Party, &s;o the high
Church were then; nay, even with
the Jacobites again&s;t the Mini&s;try,
villifying and expo&s;ing the &s;aid Lord
and Duke, and e&s;pecially a certain
Dutche&s;s, in a Manner far exceeding
all that unju&s;tifiable Rudene&s;s that
has been made u&s;e of &s;ince that Time.</P>
<P>This however obliged her Maje&s;ty
to concern her &s;elf in the matter,
and to let the Juncto &s;ee, that She
was able to &s;upport her Servants, and
that She would not be reduced to the
Nece&s;&s;ity they boa&s;ted of; the Con|&s;equence
of this was, that they were
effectually di&s;appointed, and after|wards
made no Difficulty to make
their &s;eparate Peace with her Maje|&s;ty
and her Mini&s;try. To which
Tran&s;action Fame refers us for an
<PB N="26" REF="27">
eminent Original of abandoning Al|lies,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> for it was ob&s;ervable, that
when they made their own Peace,
they left all their Confederates to the
Di&s;cretion of the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>But this Matter had another Ef|fect,
for which Rea&s;on it is made a
nece&s;&s;ary Part of this Account, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
that in the interval of this Breach,
much was di&s;covered of the Infirmi|ty,
to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it, of both
Sides; and while they were villifying
one another, to render their De&s;igns
black in the View of the People, they
really, as it often happens in le&s;&s;er
Ca&s;es, made the Per&s;ons on both
Sides look le&s;s in the E&s;teem of the
World than they did before; there
was much Dirt ca&s;t on both Sides in
the Quarrel, and it cannot be &s;aid,
that it was all wiped off in the Re|conciliation,
nor did the Breach leave
either Side in the &s;ame Station of her
Maje&s;ty's E&s;teem as it found them.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty was a &s;trict Ob&s;erver
at that Time, of every Article of the
Conduct of either Side; and it made
<PB N="27" REF="28">
no &s;mall Impre&s;&s;ion on her Mind,
that She found both Sides were to
make a Property of her Authority,
and that She was to be reduced to a
Nece&s;&s;ity of acting their Mea&s;ures,
which Side &s;oever prevailed. From
which ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation, tho' her Ma|je&s;ty
&s;ound it needful to &s;upport the
Mini&s;try then in her Service, again&s;t
tho&s;e who &s;o openly affronted her
Admini&s;tration as well as her Per&s;on,
in oppo&s;ing them at that Time; yet
from that Time her Maje&s;ty enter|tained
Thoughts of a general Change
in her Mea&s;ures, and re&s;olved to &s;et
her &s;elf free as &s;oon as might be from
the unhappy Nece&s;&s;ity, which, it
&s;eems, it was &s;o ea&s;ie to reduce
her to, (<HI>viz.</HI>) of not being able to &s;up|port
her own Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>This was perfectly agreeable to the
Scheme formerly propo&s;ed by Mr.
<HI>Harley</HI> to the Lord <HI>Godolphin,</HI> and often
explain'd to her Maje&s;ty before that
Time, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to re&s;tore her Maje&s;ty
to an entire Freedom of acting; that
all her Affairs &s;hould be explained to,
and laid before her Maje&s;ty; that She
<PB N="28" REF="29">
&s;hould no more wear the Crown
without the Scepter; that the Doors
&s;hould be opened to all Her Subjects,
and a free Acce&s;s to Her Per&s;on be
given to all; that Ca&s;es of Con&s;e|quence
might not come cover'd with
the Repre&s;entations of the Mini&s;ters;
but every thing be laid fairly before
the <HI>Queen,</HI> that She might act with
open Eyes, &s;ee for Her &s;elf, and give
to, not receive Commands from, Her
Mini&s;try. Her Maje&s;ty had, with
&s;ome Regret, received the former Im|portunities
of &s;ome about Her, in the
Ca&s;e of placing or di&s;placing of Per|&s;ons;
and e&s;pecially that unplea&s;ant,
uncomely, as well as undutiful Ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of, <HI>I cannot &s;erve Your Ma|je&s;ty,
unle&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. and began to be tir'd
with &s;ome Peoples per&s;onal Conduct,
who&s;e Services were otherwi&s;e very
acceptable to Her, and their Fidelity
entirely un&s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>There were two other things which
Her Maje&s;ty could not avoid taking
a particular Notice of in this Breach;
and the future Conduct of the&s;e ve|ry
Per&s;ons make it very much to the
<PB N="29" REF="30">
pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e to mention it here,
<HI>viz.</HI> (1.) That the &s;aid <HI>Juncto</HI> made
no Scruple, in order to di&s;place the
&s;aid Lord and Duke, to bring the
mo&s;t known pro&s;e&s;s'd <HI>Jacobites,</HI> as
well of the Nobility as of the Com|mons,
as well in <HI>Scotland</HI> as in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
into their Confederacy, and
even to Vote for them in the Election
of the Parliament then chu&s;ing, and
many of them were actually elected
by the Intere&s;t of the &s;aid Whig
<HI>Juncto;</HI> the Names are ea&s;y to be
given. (2.) That they made no Dif|ficulty
of di&s;placing the D. of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;<HI>h</HI>
from the Command of the Army;
and thought there would be no Dan|ger
to the Confederacy in it at all;
and Her Maje&s;ty was inform'd, that
they went &s;o far as to &s;ound the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> either to &s;ee how they would
approve of a Change, or to prepare
them not to be &s;urpriz'd at it: The
like things having been cen&s;ured in
&s;uch rude Terms by the &s;ame Per|&s;ons,
who then, for their own private
Ends, engag'd in them; Her Maje|&s;ty
could not but call to mind the
Circum&s;tances, and look on the Per|&s;ons
<PB N="30" REF="31">
with &s;ome Re&s;entment, when
they came to &s;peak of the &s;ame things
as trayterous, ungrateful, perfidious,
and the like.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and &s;uch as the&s;e, were the
things which pav'd the Way for the
new Turn, which &s;oon after happen|ed;
in which Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> acted con|&s;onant
to what he had from the fir&s;t
propos'd; laying before Her Maje&s;ty
&s;uch Mea&s;ures as were calculated for
quieting, not di&s;turbing the Admini|&s;tration;
not propo&s;ing &s;uch Change
of Parties, and &s;uch Turnings out of
Per&s;ons, as afterwards happened;
no &s;uch thing being in View, till the
Combinations of certain Per&s;ons in
Places, and who acted upon the old
Principle of reducing the <HI>Queen</HI> to
the Nece&s;&s;ity of acting as they de|&s;ired,
oblig'd Her Maje&s;ty to do it.</P>
<P>It is not needful to enter into the
Detail of the Conduct of others;
but this Pa&s;&s;age cannot be omitted,
<HI>viz.</HI> that the Evening of that Day,
when the <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Go|dolphin,</HI>
was di&s;placed, a general Meet|ing
<PB N="31" REF="32">
of the Per&s;ons in that Intere&s;t,
was held at Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;Hou&s;e,
where it was laid down as a Maxim,
that the new Managers could no
Way &s;upport the Undertaking; that
they could never be able to keep up
the publick Credit, rai&s;e Money, or
carry on the War; but would &s;oon
plunge the <HI>Queen</HI> in &s;uch inextricable
Difficulties, as that She would be
forc'd to come back to them; and
therefore it was their Bu&s;ine&s;s, one
and all, to re&s;olve not to come into
the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Mea&s;ures, in order to di|&s;tre&s;s
Her new Mini&s;ters, and &s;o ob|lige
Her to di&s;mi&s;s them.</P>
<P>How openly they pur&s;ued this
Re&s;olution, is well known; as al&s;o
how Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> now made Chan|cellor
of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> and one of
the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Trea&s;ury,</HI>
&s;urmounted all the Difficulties which
they ca&s;t in the Way, &s;upply'd the
Money, kept up the Credit, and run
into no Plunges, as was &s;ugge&s;ted,
by which they were no le&s;s &s;urprized
than di&s;appointed; all this is recent
and known.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33">
It is named here, to &s;hew where
began the Mi&s;chief of the Change;
this Meeting of the late Managers
was neither more or le&s;s than form|ing
them&s;elves into a Faction again&s;t
the <HI>Queen,</HI> and Her new Mea&s;ures;
which, though it did not produce
the Nece&s;&s;ity upon the <HI>Queen</HI> of
changing Her Mini&s;try again, as they
expected; yet it did put the new
Managers upon making u&s;e of other
Hands than they intended; to which
Point of Circum&s;tance, all that has
&s;ince happened, may be traced back,
as to its proper and only Original;
for had that Faction not been form|ed,
or had they not, when formed,
ab&s;olutely rejected the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Offers
of Accommodation, and of keeping
them in their Places, nothing is more
true, than that all things had gone
on in the u&s;ual Cour&s;e of the Admi|ni&s;tration,
by the &s;ame Methods, to
the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, and almo&s;t by the
&s;ame Per&s;ons as before. <HI>But Sathan
hindered;</HI> and the Conduct of the
outed Party was very &s;ingular on
that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="34">
It occurr'd to them naturally, that
the Parliament in being would take
&s;ome Step in their Favour; and that
they &s;hould be able to &s;pread the
Unea&s;ine&s;s much farther, if not
throughout the Kingdom, and it of|fered
as a Foundation of forming a
new Intere&s;t in their Favour; this
pa&s;s'd a while, and their Friends in
the City falling upon the new Mini|&s;try
with &s;ome Attempts of another
Nature, it was evident, they &s;up|ported
tho&s;e Attempts, by their De|pendance
on their Intere&s;t in the
Parliament; and &s;o open they were
in their Politicks on this Occa&s;ion,
that they were not backward to &s;ay,
The Parliament would unravel the
new Mea&s;ures, and the <HI>Queen</HI> could
go on no farther than the next Se&s;|&s;ion.
The Mini&s;try were too vigi|lant
not to &s;ee the De&s;ign; nor was
Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> ignorant how far they
might probably go to make good
their Threats: This made it ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;&s;olve the Parlia|ment;
the Inclination of the People
al&s;o to the Change, now beginning
<PB N="34" REF="35">
to appear more than it had done be|fore;
and the new Elections appear|ing
to be generally on the Side of
the Change, the Re&s;olutions of the
Party mention'd above, began to
waver, their Intere&s;t &s;eparate, and,
in fine, the new Mini&s;try, after this,
met with le&s;s Difficulty and Ob&s;tru|ction
in their Affairs, though not
with le&s;s ill Treatment from particu|lar
Per&s;ons, and from the Party in
the City e&s;pecially, where the Fer|ment
went too high to be &s;poken
of in a narrow Compa&s;s, and where
the Mea&s;ures taken to ruin the Pub|lick
Credit were &s;uch, though un&s;uc|ce&s;sful,
as has not been ever pra|ctis'd
before, and gave Her Maje&s;ty
great Cau&s;e to re&s;ent them, even on
the whole Party.</P>
<P>In this Juncture, Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> was
&s;natch'd from the Admini&s;tration, by
an unparallell'd Attempt upon his
Life; at fir&s;t it &s;urpriz'd every one,
as it began to be thought the Attempt
of the afore&s;aid Party, or &s;ome &s;et on
Work by them; but it &s;oon appear'd
the &s;ingle Act of an enrag'd <HI>French|man,</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="36">
the <HI>Marqui&s;s de Gui&s;card,</HI> made
de&s;perate by being detected of a
Trea&s;onable Corre&s;pondence with
<HI>France,</HI> who a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated Mr. <HI>Harley</HI>
at the Council Table, &s;tabbing him
into the Brea&s;t with a Penknife, and
repeating the Blow a &s;econd Time,
not knowing that the Penknife was
broke, and the Blade left in the
Wound; he gave him a Contu&s;ion
with the Handle by the next Blow,
more dangerous and painful than the
fir&s;t: What mov'd this <HI>Scelerat</HI> to &s;uch
an horrid Act, the apprehending him,
wounding him, his Impri&s;onment, and
Death in the Pri&s;on of <HI>Newgate,</HI> are
needle&s;s in this Account; being al&s;o
made publick at that Time by other
Writers.</P>
<P>None could be blamed for being of
the Opinion, till the Particulars ap|pear'd,
that this Blow was given by
the Procurement of the other Party;
becau&s;e it &s;uited &s;o exactly with the
Language given publickly the Per&s;on
of Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> at that Time, as well in
the City as el&s;ewhere, that it was
confe&s;s'd by them&s;elves, the Su&s;picion
<PB N="36" REF="37">
was ju&s;t: But the Horror of the Fact
&s;o touch'd tho&s;e, who had a Sen&s;e of
Humanity, that the Generality, even
of the Enemies of the new Mini&s;try,
could not refrain expre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves
with &s;ome Warmth again&s;t it,
and it a&s;&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome time to the
treating him with &s;omething le&s;s In|decency
than before; and not only
&s;o, but the Affairs of the Govern|ment
gaining upon the Oppo&s;ers eve|ry
Day, the new Mea&s;ures began to
be better reli&s;h'd among the People
than before.</P>
<P>Soon after the Recovery of Mr.
<HI>Harley,</HI> and his Conduct in the pub|lick
Affairs having &s;atisfy'd Her Ma|je&s;ty,
that his Qualifications for the
Employment were equal to the
Weight of &s;uch an Employ, the Com|mi&s;&s;ion
for the <HI>Trea&s;ury</HI> was di&s;&s;olv|ed,
and Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> was made Lord
<HI>High Trea&s;urer</HI> of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> Her
Maje&s;ty doing him the Honour to
give Him the Staff with Her own
Hand, and at the &s;ame Time to
&s;ign a Patent, creating him <HI>Earl of
Oxford and Earl Mortimer,</HI> and &s;oon
<PB N="37" REF="38">
after created him al&s;o <HI>Knight of the
Garter.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e things are needful to men|tion,
becau&s;e they are the Sum of
all the Advantages which he can be
&s;aid to &s;hare out for him&s;elf, having
not, his Enemies being Judges, accu|mulated
Honour or Profits, as has
been u&s;ual by Per&s;ons in great Po&s;ts;
and this may be &s;aid without Boa&s;t|ing,
that no per&s;onal Avarice, no ag|grandizing
of his Family, no getting
of Grants, either to him&s;elf or to
his Family, has been, or with Ju|&s;tice
can be charged on him; though,
by the Share he enjoy'd of His Roy|al
Mi&s;tre&s;s's Favour, it might be &s;up|pos'd,
that he could not want Op|portunity
for many things, which
might have been as profitable as the
mo&s;t craving Temper might be &s;atis|fy'd
with.</P>
<P>The new Parliament being met,
the Lower Hou&s;e appeared enclin'd
dutifully to oblige Her Maje&s;ty, in e|very
thing con&s;i&s;tent with their Li|berties,
and with the publick Good;
<PB N="38" REF="39">
and the <HI>Queen</HI> never de&s;iring any
thing of them which &s;hock'd their
Affections to their Country's Safety
and Advantage: This mutual Re|ctitude
of Principle, created a perfect
Harmony between Her Maje&s;ty and
the Hou&s;e; every thing offered by
the Hou&s;e to Her Maje&s;ty, met with
a gracious Reception and ready
Grant; and every thing laid before
them by the <HI>Queen,</HI> was &s;o ju&s;t and
&s;o clear, that the Hou&s;e, with an
entire Confidence, came into Her
Maje&s;ty's Mea&s;ures cheerfully, and
with the greate&s;t Alacrity imagi|nable.</P>
<P>This
Harmony was a great Di&s;|appointment
to the Party, who op|po&s;ed
the Mini&s;try, and was chiefly
owing to the exact Adhering to
&s;uch Mea&s;ures in the Admini&s;tration,
as could admit no &s;ub&s;tantial Ob|jection;
for it could not be &s;aid,
that the other People were not vi|gilant,
to take Hold of every thing
that might have given them any
ju&s;t Advantage. The <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> as
far as he directed any thing, took
<PB N="39" REF="40">
Care to keep it within the ordinary
Rules of Bu&s;ine&s;s; and, particularly,
knowing what Men he had to do
with, took Care to have every thing
tran&s;acted in full Council, and to be
duly minuted in the Books. He kept
to the Principle fir&s;t laid down, of
having the <HI>Queen</HI> &s;ee with Her own
Eyes; and after duly debating things
in Her Pre&s;ence, to have every thing
directed by Her Maje&s;ty, with Con|&s;ent,
of Her own Knowledge, that
Her Maje&s;ty might have no Occa&s;ion
to &s;ay, as had been too much the
Ca&s;e formerly, that She left things
to &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons, and had
been ill &s;erv'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> likewi&s;e took e&s;pecial
Care to have all Bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;acted
in the proper Offices, and &s;ign'd by
the Hands who&s;e Province it was;
thereby re&s;toring the Admini&s;tration
to its natural Cour&s;e, and delivering
the Government from the Grievance
of a <HI>PRIME MINISTER;</HI>
and this is evident now, even to the
Surprize of his Enemies, who hav|ing
&s;uppos'd, that the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> tran&s;|acted
<PB N="40" REF="41">
every thing, as had been the
general Belief; and for which all a|long
the Party loaded him with in|finite
A&s;per&s;ions, find now that he
really managed nothing &s;eparately;
and rather employ'd him&s;elf to pre|&s;erve
the Oeconomy of the Admini|&s;tration,
and &s;ee the publick Bu&s;ine&s;s
di&s;tributed into the proper Hands,
and then leaving tho&s;e Hands to di&s;|charge
their Duty, than interpo&s;ing
his own Authority, or encroach|ing
upon the Province of the Mini|&s;ters.</P>
<P>Perhaps
this Truth is &s;o new, and
the contrary has been &s;o generally
received, that it will not immediate|ly
meet with that Credit, that ought
to be expected to a thing &s;o mani|fe&s;t;
but when it &s;hall appear, that,
in unravelling the Admini&s;tration of
tho&s;e Times, nothing can be found
tran&s;acted by him, but what was the
particular Duty of his Office, as <HI>Trea|&s;urer;</HI>
and that, on the contrary, e|very
Mini&s;ter of State did the Duty
of his Place, and acted to the full
what was his particular Province to
<PB N="41" REF="42">
act; and that con&s;equently, they can|not
fa&s;ten &s;uch things upon the Trea|&s;urer
as it was hoped he might be
charged with. <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> if this &s;hould
not be the Ca&s;e, it will be a full
Confirmation of what is &s;aid here,
that he rather directed every Man to
his Duty, than acted in their Province
him&s;elf. It was his Complaint, during
the Admini&s;tration of others, that
they engro&s;&s;ed the Bu&s;ine&s;s into their
Hands; that the Secretaries and Privy
Council were but Agents, and were
made u&s;e of for Form only; and
that the <HI>Queen</HI> being &s;urrounded by
them, all Acce&s;s to her Per&s;on was
cut off; and it was his profe&s;s'd Inten|tion,
that it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e in
his Admini&s;tration; and if this is not
made &s;ufficiently evident to tho&s;e who
are now &s;o narrowly in&s;pecting his
Conduct, by the Manner in which
they will find all Bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;acted,
there is another Proof which will oc|cur
to every Under&s;tanding, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
the Power the other Mini&s;ters of
State, and Men of Intreigue, obtain|ed
hereby with the Queen; by which
they afterwards took upon them to
<PB N="42" REF="43">
oppo&s;e his Councils, and at la&s;t ef|fectually
&s;upplanted him.</P>
<P>If it had been true, that every
thing had been done by him, as it
was unju&s;tly &s;aid by his Enemies, it
could not have been true, that his Ma|nagement
was ill approved of by the
Queen, and other Men entru&s;ted, di|&s;tinct
from him, and who, when he
oppo&s;ed them; appeared to have a
greater Intere&s;t in her Maje&s;ty than
he had, till at length they obliged
him either to come into their Mea|&s;ures,
which, in regard to the Good
of his Country, he could not comply
with, or to withdraw from them, and
quit the Admini&s;tration, which he <HI>ve|ry
happily for him&s;elf</HI> cho&s;e to do.</P>
<P>In this Conduct con&s;i&s;ts &s;o much
his pre&s;ent Safety, that we &s;ee &s;ome
of his Enemies very much di&s;appoint|ed,
in that they cannot find him in
&s;everal Parts of the Management of
things which they thought were all
his own; and it is &s;urpri&s;ing to find
how far this Opinion of his, being the
<HI>Fac Totum</HI> in all the Admini&s;tration,
<PB N="43" REF="44">
had prevailed; and the Enemies of the
Trea&s;urer are under &s;ome Confu&s;ion,
by their not finding all Bu&s;ine&s;s dire|cted
by him. It is manife&s;t, that they
had entertained a Notion, that the
Queen was wholly governed by him;
that She did nothing her &s;elf, and no|thing
but by his Direction; which is
&s;o evidently untrue, that it appears
her Maje&s;ty not only acted without
him, but even contrary to him, in
many things, till at la&s;t She was plea|&s;ed
to enter wholly into the Mea&s;ures
of other Men; and when he could
not be prevailed upon to join in tho&s;e
Mea&s;ures, thought fit to act quite
without him&punc; This, however unex|pected,
will &s;hew, that what has of|ten
been &s;aid to the Queen her &s;elf, is
now confirmed, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the Trea|&s;urer
bore the Load of many things
which he had no concern in; and in|deed
this was evidently one Rea&s;on
why he drew out of the Admini&s;trati|on,
of which, and of who&s;e Mi&s;takes,
tho' he did not approve, he was &s;ure
to bear the Scandal.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45">
It is not to the Purpo&s;e to enter
here into the Rea&s;ons why the Trea|&s;urer
rejected the Mea&s;ures propo&s;ed
to him by the&s;e new Men; whether
they were con&s;i&s;tent with the publick
Good, or the Queen's Safety and Ho|nour,
is fitter for them to defend, than
for him to enquire into; it &s;uffices to
&s;ay, they were &s;uch as the Trea&s;urer
thought were not for her Maje&s;ty's
Service, and that therefore he declin|ed
the public Affairs, rather than go
on upon tho&s;e Foundations. It is effe|ctually
proved by the Circum&s;tance
of his Di&s;mi&s;s al&s;o, that the Admini|&s;tration
con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal Parts, and
was not engro&s;&s;ed, <HI>as was &s;ugge&s;ted,</HI>
by the Trea&s;urer, in an arbitrary man|ner.
The Di&s;contents of other Men
having been carried to &s;uch a Length,
as to affront him even in the Execu|tion
of his Office, and to reject all the
Offers of an Accommodation or Re|conciliation,
which the Trea&s;urer fre|quently
made to them, that the pub|lic
Bu&s;ine&s;s might not be hindred. It
is likewi&s;e to be ob&s;erved, that in the&s;e
Offers of Reconciliation, the Trea&s;u|rer
<PB N="45" REF="46">
always repre&s;ented the ab&s;olute
Nece&s;&s;ity there was of having every
Office do its own Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the
Admini&s;tration to run in the due
Cour&s;e, according to the ordinary
Admini&s;tration, without any &s;ugge&s;t|ing
the Superintendency of a prime
Mini&s;ter, or &s;o much as claiming any
Re&s;erve to him&s;elf; being willing to
confine him&s;elf to the Sphere of his
Office, with more Strictne&s;s than any
of them de&s;ired.</P>
<P>It was not the lea&s;t Affliction to
the Trea&s;urer, that he found the A|varice
of &s;ome Men in Office, and the
Ambition of others, to be made great
&s;ooner than ordinary, began early to
offer Ob&s;tructions to the public Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and that he was frequently ill
u&s;ed by tho&s;e, who, he thought, had
Rea&s;on to treat him otherwi&s;e, parti|cularly
by a certain <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> that he was
not made a Peer &s;o &s;oon as he was
willing to be &s;o; as al&s;o that when
he was honoured with the Peerage,
it was but a Vi&s;count; and yet more,
that when &s;ome Garters were di&s;po|&s;ed,
he was not gratified: This was
<PB N="46" REF="47">
the more afflicting, becau&s;e that
when this Per&s;on was at fir&s;t, by the
Trea&s;urer's Intere&s;t, recommended
to her Maje&s;ty, for the Office which
he was entru&s;ted with, the Trea&s;u|rer
believed he would have acted
from Principles of Zeal for her Ma|je&s;ty's
Service, and a generous Con|cern
for the Church and Nation in
all he did, without making his private
Advancement the Sum of his De&s;ires,
and pu&s;hing that Particular &s;o far, as
to in&s;ult his Friends for the Delay,
however nece&s;&s;ary that Delay would
be to the Queen's Service, who found
it nece&s;&s;ary to make u&s;e of his Ser|vice
longer in the Hou&s;e of Commons,
and gave him A&s;&s;urances, at the &s;ame
time, that the Delay &s;hould be no
Detriment to his Rank; &s;o that it
only affected his Impatience, not his
Ambition, which was an exceeding
Aggravation of his Mi&s;take, &s;hewing
at what rate he e&s;teemed his Mi|&s;tre&s;s's
Service, and the Public Good,
which, to a Mini&s;ter of State, &s;hould
always go before his own Advance|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="48">
The Trea&s;urer failed not, upon all
Occa&s;ions, to repre&s;ent to this Per&s;on,
and to his Friends, the evil Con&s;e|quences
of dividing from the <HI>Queen's</HI>
Service, by dividing again&s;t one ano|ther;
but was always treated with
Di&s;re&s;pect, and with much Pa&s;&s;ion.
The nece&s;&s;ary Concerts in publick
Matters were much hindred by the&s;e
things, and it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to
go on in the Execution of Matters
determined in the Council to be done,
all Confidence being hereby de&s;troy|ed,
and the Harmony, nece&s;&s;ary in
carrying on &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s, where
&s;o much Oppo&s;ition was to be expe|cted,
being thus broken, it is not to
be wondred at, if it gave infinite Ad|vantages
to tho&s;e who made that Op|po&s;ition,
of which the Trea&s;urer fail|ed
not in making ju&s;t Repre&s;entations,
as well to the Per&s;ons them&s;elves, as
to her Maje&s;ty likewi&s;e, who often
&s;poke of the &s;ame with Regret.</P>
<P>But it was all to no Purpo&s;e, the
Trea&s;urer found the Heat encrea&s;e,
rather than abate; and that it par|ticularly
<PB N="48" REF="49">
bent its Fury at &s;uch things
which, altho' they were particular to
the Province of Trea&s;urer, he had
thought fit to do without communi|cating
his Schemes to him, tho' at
the &s;ame time they thought fit to
carry on the Negotiations and Trea|ties
abroad, in many Ca&s;es, without
communicating their Mea&s;ures to him,
and &s;ometimes hardly to the Queen
her&s;elf. The Trea&s;urer has been loth
to mention the mean Rea&s;ons given for
their quarrelling with him about the
Scheme for Payment of the great
Debt the Nation was engaged in,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that they &s;hould have gotten
Money by it; but &s;ince the &s;ecret
Committee have thought fit to pub|li&s;h
that Part of it, which the Trea|&s;urer
formerly laid before her Maje|&s;ty,
whereby it is no longer a Secret,
it may &s;erve to convince Mankind,
that the di&s;intere&s;ted Conduct of the
Trea&s;urer in the Admini&s;tration, and
his re&s;olving to make no private Gain
out of the Ruins of his Country,
was not the lea&s;t Part of his Manage|ment,
which tho&s;e Men di&s;liked, or
<PB N="49" REF="50">
the lea&s;t Rea&s;on why they behaved &s;o
unea&s;ily to him.</P>
<P>But to dwell no longer on this
Part, tho&s;e who knew the Difficulties
with which the Trea&s;urer &s;truggled,
in the Matters of Credit, and of Mo|ney,
and the Oppo&s;ition the Party,
whom the Queen had di&s;mi&s;s'd, made
to every Step that was taken to re|&s;tore
it, could not but wonder that
the&s;e Men, who, at the &s;ame Time
confe&s;s them&s;elves unequal to the
Work, &s;hould not be content to con|tribute
no A&s;&s;i&s;tance to it, but &s;hould,
on the contrary, &s;o much ob&s;truct
things, and encourage the Oppo&s;ition
of others, as their Breaches one with
another were known to do.</P>
<P>The Trea&s;urer had baffled the De|&s;igns
of tho&s;e who had endeavoured
to prevent his remitting Money to
the Army, and the e&s;tabli&s;hing the
Credit of the Publick; and notwith|&s;tanding
at his Entrance into the
Office, he found the Exchequer ex|hau&s;ted,
the Bank refu&s;ing to advance
Money upon &s;uch Securities as the
<PB N="50" REF="51">
Government was able to offer, had
the Army at the &s;ame time in the
Field, which &s;ome People were not
a&s;hamed to own, they expected &s;hould
mutiny for their Pay, yet he had ma|&s;tered
all the&s;e Difficulties, and gave
good Rea&s;on to believe that he would
have gone thro' every other Ob&s;tru|ction;
and it was not a little afflicting
to him, to find his Oppo&s;ers among
tho&s;e who he had, by his Intere&s;t
and Recommendation, brought into
Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Yet as things are now like to go,
it is no little Satisfaction to him, that
if there has been any criminal Nego|tiations
&s;et on Foot, any favouring the
Pretender, any Mea&s;ures entred into,
to the Prejudice of the Succe&s;&s;ion of
the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> the&s;e things
mu&s;t be found among tho&s;e Parts of
their Conduct which they were plea|&s;ed
to tran&s;act by them&s;elves, and to
which they did not vouch&s;afe to ad|mit
the Trea&s;urer, as not being &s;o
much at that Time in their Confi|dence;
and as they acted the&s;e things
by them&s;elves, &s;o they mu&s;t an&s;wer
<PB N="51" REF="52">
for them by them&s;elves, if the pre&s;ent
Government think fit to call them to
Account for it, the Trea&s;urer having
had no Concern in any thing of that
Nature, and is per&s;uaded that no Man
had the A&s;&s;urance to make an Offer
of any thing of that kind to her Ma|je&s;ty,
and that if they had, that the
<HI>Queen</HI> would have re&s;ented it with the
utmo&s;t Indignation.</P>
<P>The Ob&s;truction the&s;e things gave
to the publick Admini&s;tration, had
divers other Effects; and particularly
it gave Encouragement to the outed
Party, in their vigorous Oppo&s;ition of
all her Maje&s;ty's Mea&s;ures, which
they carried up to &s;uch a height, as to
expect the Hou&s;e of Peers would be
brought to their Side; and tho' the
Trea&s;urer had a firm Satisfaction in
the Peers, that they would not be
impo&s;ed upon in the&s;e things, yet &s;ee|ing
the Numbers appear'd &s;omething
equal, and that the Party di&s;covered
&s;ome A&s;&s;urance of carrying their
Point; Her Maje&s;ty re&s;olving not to
run the Venture, cho&s;e to make a
Number of Lords for ballancing his
<PB N="52" REF="53">
Enemies, a Practice allowed by the
Law, and undoubtedly in the Prero|gative,
however clamoured very
much in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; and not|with&s;tanding
which, as was evident
by the Sequel, the Trea&s;urer's Opi|nion
appear'd to be founded on a right
Judgment of things, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that they
were &s;afe in the Votes of the Peers
who were already in the Hou&s;e, the
Que&s;tion being carried in the Hou&s;e
by one Voice more than the Num|ber
of new Lords then created. The
Warmth of tho&s;e People, who, at this
Time, pu&s;hed at the new Mini&s;ters,
may be judged of by that other In|cident
which attended at this Time,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) That the Occa&s;ional-Bill was
at this Time brought in by them,
which they had always oppo&s;ed be|fore,
and which, it &s;eems, was now
&s;ubmitted to, in Favour of the E. of
<HI>N&mdash;'s</HI> Scheme, who declared
him&s;elf again&s;t the Admini&s;tration
from this Time, for Rea&s;ons &s;o mean,
as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> requires not to be remem|bred,
and who, however, forgot not to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> a good Capitulation with tho&s;e

Point of the Whiggs, which they had
always, till now, with&s;tood; but
neither the E of <HI>N</HI>&mdash;in&s;i&s;ting on
&s;uch high Terms for &s;o mean an Ad|vantage,
as the be&s;t Service he could
do them, nor the Ea&s;ine&s;s of the
Whiggs at that Time, to part with
the Di&s;&s;enters on &s;uch cheap Terms,
were by far, &s;o wonderful, as the
Satisfaction with which the Di&s;&s;en|ters
&s;tood and lookt on while the
Fetters and Mannacles of this new
Law were fa&s;tened upon them; it
cannot be doubted, that &s;ecret En|gagements
were entered into between
the Parties, to take off this Law a|gain
by Parliament, when an Occa|&s;ion
&s;hould offer: When that Occa&s;i|on
&s;hall be &s;aid to offer, Time mu&s;t
&s;hew. All the U&s;e which Her Ma|je&s;ty
made of the&s;e things, was to
&s;ee to what a Length tho&s;e, who
re&s;olved to oppo&s;e her Mea&s;ures,
were come, and what Sacrifices they
would make, to bring about their
Schemes; but the&s;e things moved
Her not at all.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55">
It was far more afflicting to her
Maje&s;ty, to &s;ee Her Servants cla&s;h|ing
with one another, in the Execu|tion
of Her Commands; and to &s;ee
the Endeavours, u&s;ed by Her&s;elf, and
tho&s;e who adhered to Her Plea&s;ure,
ineffectual to the putting a Stop to
it; yet even the&s;e Evils, tho' dan|gerous
to the Admini&s;tration, had
their Effect for the bringing about
the great Event which now came on
the Stage, concurring with the Mea|&s;ures
of the Whiggs, &s;o far as to make
it be &s;till more and more Her <HI>Ma|je&s;ty's</HI>
Opinion, that it was ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to put an End to the
War.</P>
<P>The Trea&s;urer's Opinion was not
material on the Subject of a Peace,
the <HI>Queen</HI> having declared, that it
was Her firm Re&s;olution, if po&s;&s;ible,
to be done upon ju&s;t Conditions, to
put an End to the War; but the
Trea&s;urer was more convinced of the
Nece&s;&s;ity, as well as Ju&s;tice of Her
<HI>Maje&s;ty's</HI> &s;aid Re&s;olution, when he &s;aw
not only the Warmth wherewith the
<PB N="55" REF="56">
oppo&s;ite Party oppo&s;ed the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI>
even in carrying on the War; but the
Divi&s;ions apparently breaking into
the Admini&s;tration, by the Power of
tho&s;e, who &s;et up a new Faction in
the Mini&s;try, and by the Influence
they had, not only upon the <HI>Queen,</HI>
but upon the Members of Parliament,
and upon &s;ome u&s;eful People in mo&s;t
Offices under her <HI>Maje&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>Yet the Trea&s;urer took no Steps
in the Affair of the Peace, till the
<HI>French,</HI> having made Propo&s;als of
Peace to Her Maje&s;ty, it came be|fore
him to con&s;ider, whether tho&s;e
Propo&s;als were &s;uch as might lay a
Foundation for a &s;olid Negotiation.
The Trea&s;urer took nothing from
them otherwi&s;e than <HI>ad Referendum,</HI>
neither entered into any &s;ecret Nego|tiation
without Her <HI>Maje&s;ty's</HI> Directi|on
and Knowledge: What any other
Per&s;on might do, being employed or
directed by this new Faction, the
Trea&s;urer accounts not for, any more
than he does for many of the Orders
and Directions given to the Per&s;ons
<PB N="56" REF="57">
employed abroad to carry it on, <HI>in
which he had no Concern.</HI></P>
<P>The Trea&s;urer cannot but hope,
that the pre&s;ent Enquiry, which is ma|king
into the&s;e things, will &s;erve to
his Vindication in that Part, where|in
he &s;uffers in the general Scandal
of other Mens actings, as if all things
had been directed by him; the con|trary
is evident in many other Ca&s;es
be&s;ides that of the Peace, wherein
his Part of the Negotiations &s;eemed
rather to be, to &s;et to Rights the
Mi&s;takes made by others; and to
put them in the Way of a regular
Negotiation, after the mo&s;t remi&s;s
and di&s;concerted Conduct had
brought them into Confu&s;ion, as was
many times the Ca&s;e: If the Treaty
&s;uffered by tho&s;e Steps, and if the
<HI>French</HI> were vigilant to make Advan|tage
of the People, who, they found,
acted with le&s;s Regularity than in a
Ca&s;e of &s;uch Con&s;equence they had
Rea&s;on to expect; the Trea&s;urer has
the Satisfaction of &s;eeing, that the
Advantages &s;o made are the le&s;s, by
<PB N="57" REF="58">
the Part he acted in that Matter, and
not the more.</P>
<P>The Truth of what is &s;aid of the
Trea&s;urer not being Ma&s;ter of the
Mea&s;ures, by which the &s;aid new
Faction then acted, was evident from
their obtaining, without his Con&s;ent
or Knowledge, an Order from Her
<HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> to pay the Sum of Twenty
Eight Thou&s;and Thirty Six Pounds
Five Shillings for Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> on the
Account of the Expedition to <HI>Cana|da;</HI>
which Sum the Trea&s;urer &s;cru|pled
to pay, for &s;uch Rea&s;ons as are
well known to be ju&s;t, among which,
one was, that he had Rea&s;on to be|lieve
the &s;aid Demand was a Fraud,
that the Money was to be applyed to
private U&s;e, and that the greate&s;t
Part, if not all, was not to be em|ployed
in the Service for which it
was pretended to be asked; which
Rea&s;on likewi&s;e cau&s;ed the Trea&s;u|rer
to withdraw him&s;elf out of that
matter, and to refu&s;e, for &s;ome time
before, to meet with tho&s;e who tran&s;|acted
it.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59">
Neither will it be of any Force to
&s;ay, that the Breaches did not take
Effect till toward the End of that
Admini&s;tration, and that the Trea|&s;urer
was the &s;ole Director for the
fir&s;t Three Years, as &s;ome in&s;inuate,
to take off the Force of the&s;e Re|marks;
for it is certain, that tho' the
open Di&s;covery of the&s;e Divi&s;ions,
and their breaking out into a Flame,
did not appear without Doors till
after the Peace was fini&s;hed; yet the
fatal Influence of them began, even
at the Beginning of the <HI>Mini&s;try;</HI>
the Intere&s;t began to divide in <HI>Feb.</HI>
1710-11, and the Trea&s;urer refu|&s;ed
to meet in &s;everal Congre&s;|&s;es
of <HI>their Allies;</HI> becau&s;e he found
them carrying on criminal Intreagues
for the defrauding the Public, and
enriching them&s;elves by the Spoils of
their Country.</P>
<P>It would expo&s;e the new Faction
afore&s;aid, &s;hould it be made publick,
how they treated the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI>
for refu&s;ing to corrupt his Hands,
and &s;tain his Integrity, with betray|ing
his Sovereign to tho&s;e, who, he
<PB N="58" REF="60">
fore&s;aw, would betray all to their
voratious Avarice; how he was ne|ver
to be forgiven the Omi&s;&s;ion of
&s;uch a Step; and that they would,
by no Means, be thought to have
Ju&s;tice from him, if they were hin|der'd
from making a Prey of their
Country.</P>
<P>It is becau&s;e he &s;trives not to load
any Man, much le&s;s tho&s;e, who, he
fears, have already too much Guilt
to an&s;wer for, that he forbears to en|ter
into the detecting tho&s;e Pra|ctices,
which he then abhorr'd; it is
enough to mention what tho&s;e Men
too well know the Truth of, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
That from the Beginning he found
their Mea&s;ures too much calculated
for private Advantage, without that
di&s;intere&s;ted Aim at the publick Ser|vice,
which the Duty of Mini&s;ters of
State requir'd; and that, according
to his Duty, he, with Plainne&s;s and
Sincerity, <HI>told them</HI> his Thoughts of
it, in order to their reforming the
Principle from which they acted;
<HI>told the Queen of it,</HI> in order to pre|vent
<HI>Her Maje&s;ty's</HI> being impos'd up|on;
<PB N="60" REF="61">
and being able to do no more,
<HI>withdrew from them</HI> in tho&s;e things
which he did not approve; as, in
particular, that Affair of the Money
demanded for the Expedition to <HI>Ca|nada.</HI></P>
<P>In
which Affair, the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> has
the Satisfaction of making it appear,
that he did not come into the Fraud;
and that, notwith&s;tanding the Im|portunity
of the Per&s;ons, he re&s;i&s;ted
their Demand of the Money, till &s;uch
repeated Orders were &s;ent him to
comply with it from <HI>Her Maje&s;ty,</HI> as
he had no Power to with&s;tand; and
likewi&s;e has had the Satisfaction to
find, that, &s;ince the&s;e things, <HI>Her
Maje&s;ty</HI> had an Opportunity to &s;ee the
Cheat more openly detected by his
Means; and to know, that whatever
was &s;ugge&s;ted by the <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> of a
de&s;ign'd Fraud in that Ca&s;e, was
true.</P>
<P>But what was yet more wonder|ful,
was, that the Per&s;ons concern'd
were not a&s;ham'd to vindicate them|&s;elves
in this Practice; and to &s;ug|ge&s;t,
<PB N="61" REF="62">
that they ought to be allow'd
to do &s;uch things; &s;ignifying al&s;o
their great Re&s;entment at the <HI>Trea|&s;urer,</HI>
as if they were wrong'd by
him, in being re&s;train'd from tho&s;e
things, which no hone&s;t Man could
allow.</P>
<P>The Peace having been effectually
&s;et on Foot in the Year 1712. met
with unexpected Oppo&s;ition at Home;
and as it was thought that tho&s;e of
the Allies, who &s;eem'd to appear
mo&s;t active again&s;t it Abroad, were
mov'd to do &s;o, by the Impre&s;&s;ions
which they receiv'd from hence; it
was, by <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Command,
made his Province to &s;et on Foot
&s;uch Negotiations in &s;uch Foreign
Courts as were nece&s;&s;ary, in order to
undeceive the Princes and States A|broad,
as often as they had receiv'd
ill Impre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Inten|tions,
and to &s;et Her Mea&s;ures in a
true Light before them, that no Mi&s;|con&s;tructions
might be made of Her
&s;incere De&s;ires to act in Concert
with them, and for their Intere&s;ts;
and, con&s;equently, no fatal Mi&s;un|der&s;tandings
<PB N="62" REF="63">
might happen in, which
might &s;eparate the Allies one from
another, which would be a Means
to make the Advantages, which
might be obtain'd by an unanimous
Treaty, either le&s;s in them&s;elves, or
difficult to obtain; and it is not to be
wonder'd, if the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> &s;hould af|terwards,
in the Account of the&s;e
things which he laid before <HI>Her Ma|je&s;ty</HI>
in the Year 1714. &s;ay, That,
during the fir&s;t Year of the Peace,
<HI>his Hands were full of negotiating the
Peace in all Courts abroad;</HI> &s;eeing the
Conduct of the&s;e Men, and the Mi|&s;takes
they made, made it often dif|ficult,
as well as trouble&s;ome, to re|concile
their Mea&s;ures, and to di|&s;tingui&s;h
between what they had
done, and what <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> intended
to have had them do.</P>
<P>As to what was offer'd at Home
again&s;t the Negotiations of the Peace,
<HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> took little Notice of;
nor did it make any other Impre&s;&s;ion
on Her, than to convince Her more
and more, of the Nece&s;&s;ity She was
under of fini&s;hing the War, and
<PB N="63" REF="64">
confirming Her Opinion in the Rea|&s;onablene&s;s
of Her Negotiations. The
Oppo&s;ition made about that Time
to the publick Admini&s;tration, as well
of the Trea&s;ury, as of the military
Affairs, gave <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> &s;till le&s;s
Di&s;turbance; for the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> having
been &s;upported by the needful Funds,
which the Parliament, with great
Duty and Application, di&s;patch'd, to
<HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Satisfaction, ea&s;ily &s;ur|mounted
the Difficulties which &s;ome
endeavour'd to ca&s;t in his Way,
in the procuring Money to carry on
the publick Affairs, and the <HI>Queen</HI>'s
Bu&s;ine&s;s now began to be on a bet|ter
Foot than ever. The Party,
who, from the Beginning, had op|pos'd
<HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Mea&s;ures at
Home, and embarra&s;s'd them Abroad,
began to lo&s;e Courage, and to give
it over, finding the <HI>Queen</HI> re&s;olved to
pur&s;ue Her ju&s;t De&s;igns, and Her
Servants in a Capacity to &s;upport
Her Admini&s;tration, which they had
been very po&s;itive, in their A&s;&s;urances
to the Foreign Courts in Alliance
with the <HI>Queen,</HI> could not be brought
to pa&s;s, and on the Mi&s;carriage
<PB N="64" REF="65">
whereof, the Sum of their Affair de|pended.</P>
<P>As the &s;aid A&s;&s;urances to the Fo|reign
Courts had created much Dif|ficulties
to the Mini&s;ters, and had
made the Negotiations very preca|rious;
&s;o when the Failure of tho&s;e
A&s;&s;urances appear'd, as it did very
evident, by the withdrawing of &s;ome
Per&s;ons from the Kingdom, and by
the Submi&s;&s;ion of &s;everal active Peo|ple
at Home, and by the dutiful and
cheerful Concurrence of the Parlia|ment
then &s;itting; in which all the
Difficulties which could be &s;tarted
by the malecontent Party, were
clear'd up, to the full Satisfaction of
the &s;aid Parliament, who evidently
came into the Peace, and even into
the Manner, or Terms of it: I &s;ay,
on the Failure of tho&s;e A&s;&s;urances
given from hence to &s;ome Foreign
Courts, and &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary Steps as
were taken by the <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> to a&s;|&s;ure
tho&s;e Courts of the Sincerity of
<HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Intentions: Many of
tho&s;e Courts appear'd &s;atisfy'd, and
things went on in a free and open
<PB N="65" REF="66">
Negotiation abroad for a while, with
more Succe&s;s, and le&s;s Difficulty, than
before.</P>
<P>Yet even in this Part, in which
they could contribute &s;o little, did
the Per&s;ons abovementioned give the
publick Affairs all imaginable Ob|&s;truction,
and make the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI>'s
Work thereby exceedingly difficult,
by their frequent breaking in upon
Mea&s;ures, acting ra&s;hly, and with|out
Concert, and perhaps &s;ometimes
without &s;ufficient Directions, or Or|ders,
in things of the nice&s;t Nature;
in which the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI>'s Intere&s;t with
them was &s;o &s;mall, as that whatever
he could &s;ay to them on that Head,
was to very little Effect; and for
that Rea&s;on, as likewi&s;e becau&s;e he
was willing to do nothing which
&s;hould render Her Maje&s;ty unea&s;y,
or ob&s;truct Her Service, he gave
them as little Ob&s;truction as po&s;|&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But
as Men, who agree but ill in
the right Management of their Of|fice,
are likely to agree wor&s;e with
<PB N="66" REF="67">
them&s;elves; &s;o the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> had fre|quently
his Hands full with the le&s;&s;er
Broils, which they rai&s;ed one among
another; and which, either by their
own Application, or by Her Maje|&s;ty's
Order, it was often made his
Province to reconcile.</P>
<P>It would take up much Time to
&s;peak of the&s;e Matters, and e&s;pecially
of the Conduct of the <HI>Secretary,</HI> then
Mr. <HI>St. John,</HI> before, at, and after his
having the Dignity of the <HI>Peerage</HI>
granted him by Her Maje&s;ty; in
which many are Witne&s;&s;es to the
Treatment the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> receiv'd from
the Pa&s;&s;ion of that Gentleman, and
his Friends; as it relates to the De|lay
of his Advancement at fir&s;t, and
his being ill &s;atisfy'd with the Degree
of it, when granted: The Particulars
of which, though Her Maje&s;ty's
Conduct was &s;o ju&s;t, and &s;upported
with &s;uch Rea&s;ons, as could not but
be &s;ubmitted to by all his Friends;
yet were receiv'd by him with &s;uch
Re&s;entment at the <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> as it has
not been u&s;ual for Men of like Sta|tion
<PB N="67" REF="68">
to meet with, or for Mini&s;ters
of State to give to one another.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted, but this
Conduct, as it ob&s;tructed the publick
Affairs on one Hand; &s;o it expos'd
them much on the other; le&s;&s;en'd the
E&s;teem of the Per&s;ons, as well as the
Power of Her Maje&s;ty's Servants,
and brought the Admini&s;tration into
Contempt, both at Home and A|broad;
and, which was &s;till wor&s;e,
exceedingly di&s;turbed Her Maje&s;ty,
divided Her E&s;teem this Way or that,
as Her Maje&s;ty found to Day this
Per&s;on, to Morrow that, acting up
to, or below the Duty of their Sta|tion;
di&s;tracted the publick Councils,
and oftentimes caus'd Her Maje&s;ty to
&s;hift. Her Service out of one Hand,
and into another, which gave much
Di&s;&s;atisfaction to the <HI>Queen</HI> in &s;everal
things; and Her Maje&s;ty failed not
oftentimes to &s;ignify Her Di&s;plea&s;ure
at the&s;e things; which it was much
more ea&s;y for Her Maje&s;ty to do,
than to find a Remedy for them.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="69">
This caus'd the <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> after
things were brought to a length not
to be otherwi&s;e accommodated, and
after he had, in vain, by long Letters,
as well as by frequent &s;peaking to
the other Per&s;ons, pre&s;t them to a
&s;tricter and quieter Application to
their Duty, to repre&s;ent the&s;e things
to Her Maje&s;ty, in the plaine&s;t and
be&s;t Terms he could; giving Her
Maje&s;ty an Account of the di&s;tinct
Circum&s;tances She then &s;tood in,
with reference to the &s;aid unea&s;y
Per&s;ons; as al&s;o of the Scituation of
Her Affairs at that Time; and how
Her Admini&s;tration then appear'd by
their Management, to be encumber'd
with Difficulties not ea&s;y to get
through; but yet ending with pro|po&s;ing
due Remedies for the Evils
which attended it.</P>
<P>It is true, one of the be&s;t Reme|dies
for the &s;aid Evils, had been an
Unanimity of Councils, and adjoin|ing
all the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Servants together
in a &s;trict Friend&s;hip to one another,
and a mutual Di&s;charge of their Du|ty
<PB N="69" REF="70">
to Her Maje&s;ty, that each acting
in their proper Sphere, or particular
Province, with a clear and di&s;inter|e&s;ted
View to Her Maje&s;ty's Service,
might go on in a good Under&s;tand|ing
with one another, and a perfect
Harmony of De&s;ires for the publick
Good, and a ju&s;t Sub&s;ervience to
Her Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>To this Purpo&s;e, the <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> as
well in his Letter to the Lord <HI>Boling|broke,</HI>
as in &s;everal Papers and Schemes
which he gave in by Her Maje&s;ty's
Command, to regulate the&s;e Mi&s;|chiefs,
always adher'd to the fir&s;t
Opinion which he had profe&s;s'd in
the Time of the former Admini&s;tra|tion,
and of which mention has
been made, <HI>viz.</HI> That every Mi|ni&s;ter
&s;hould confine him&s;elf to
his e&s;pecial Province, concurring
therein to the general Intere&s;t of the
Sovereign, and endeavouring always
to lay before Her Maje&s;ty a true
State of Her Affairs, &s;hould then act
with Sub&s;ervience to Her Commands,
and in Concert with one another, for
Her Intere&s;t and Service: This the
<PB N="70" REF="71">
<HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> always back'd with ju&s;t Re|pre&s;entations
of what was the parti|cular
Province of the Per&s;on he wrote
to; and not without earne&s;tly pre&s;|&s;ing
him to enter into ju&s;t Mea&s;ures
for the Di&s;charge of the Matters im|mediately
before them, and with
Schemes for the carrying on the pub|lick
Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o, as to make it ea&s;y
to the <HI>Queen,</HI> and to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of ju&s;t Returns to the&s;e,
he was continually attack'd with
Quarrels and Complaints, new and
private Schemes of their own; &s;ome
of which were form'd upon Principles
that he could not, in Duty, comply
with; and upon his rejecting &s;uch
Schemes, but e&s;pecially upon his
prevailing with <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> to enter
&s;o far into the redre&s;&s;ing the&s;e things,
as to make a Nomination of Officers,

Step, I &s;ay, he was treated ever
with Outrage; nor could they be e|ver

Mini&s;try, ever after; till the <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI>
to his great Satisfaction, withdraw
<PB N="71" REF="72">
out of publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, and obtain'd
the Favour of <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> to be di&s;|mi&s;s'd
from an Admini&s;tration, in which
he had &s;o little Influence, as not to
be able to do his Duty; and yet &s;o
great an Unhappine&s;s, as to be
charged with all the Mi&s;takes which
other Men made,</P>
<P>The <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> cannot but think
the timely Di&s;mi&s;s he receiv'd, be|ing
the la&s;t Favour his Royal Mi|&s;tre&s;s
liv'd to do him, was the mo&s;t
happy Turn from Heaven that be|fel
him through the whole Cour&s;e of
his Life, &s;eeing it will te&s;tify for him,
in any Examination which may
hereafter be made into the&s;e things,
that the Mi&s;takes which may have
been made in the Time of his Ad|mini&s;tration,
have happen'd rather
from the Want of Power in him to
prevent them, than from his hav|ing
the governing Influence in the
Mini&s;try, as has been &s;ugge&s;ted;
that his Part of the Negotiations a|broad,
has been rather to rectify
what they had done ami&s;s, than to
act by him&s;elf; and that no irregular
<PB N="72" REF="73">
Steps have been taken by him, no
unwarrantable Practices, no evil
Council given by him; and that his
only Misfortune, next to his having
been &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Author of
evil Councils, has been, that he has
not been able to prevent the Effects
of them, or to deliver the <HI>Queen</HI>
from them, who&s;e Illne&s;s, many can|not
but &s;till believe, receiv'd not a
little Encrea&s;e from the Trouble the&s;e
things gave <HI>Her Maje&s;ty,</HI> and the
Grief of &s;eeing the irreconcileable
Cla&s;hings of Her Servants.</P>
<P>But to go back to the Peace: It
&s;eems, in all the Speeches about the
Tran&s;action of that Affair, the Ob|jections
lie rather again&s;t the Me|thods
taken to bring it to pa&s;s, than
again&s;t the Illegality of the Mini&s;ters
being employ'd to bring the War to
an End; which, neverthele&s;s, &s;eems
to be the previous Que&s;tion; and
here we find, that the proper En|quiry
was, as to the <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> Whe|ther
he has acted legally, in obeying
the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Commands, or not? If
any of the Mini&s;ters with, or with|out
<PB N="73" REF="74">
his Knowledge and Con&s;ent,
enter'd upon Mea&s;ures, in carrying
on the Treaty, unju&s;tifiable by the

the plainer; and the <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI>
when every Man &s;hall an&s;wer
for him&s;elf, will &s;till be the more
openly vindicated from the A&s;per|&s;ion
mention'd above, of having the
Direction of the whole Affair in him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>As
<HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> found Rea&s;ons to
re&s;olve to put an End to the War;
Her Mini&s;ter, whether ther enter'd
into <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Rea&s;ons, or not,
would find them&s;elves oblig'd to en|ter
into Her Mea&s;ures for the bring|ing
it to pa&s;s; whether the Rea&s;ons
which mov'd <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> to this Re|&s;olution,
were Her own, or were
rais'd from the Coun&s;el given to
Her by any Per&s;on in whom <HI>Her Ma|je&s;ty</HI>
repos'd &s;o much Confidence, as
to be prevail'd with by their Advice;
whether <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> was mov'd by
the Tendency &s;o natural to Her, and
the Compa&s;&s;ion mov'd in Her Brea&s;t,
<PB N="74" REF="75">
by the Expence of the Blood of Her
People; &s;ome having &s;aid, this was
the fir&s;t and only Motive; but

Her Servants from other Motives,
and be tho&s;e Motives what they will,
it &s;eems no Part of the pre&s;ent De|fence

which, on the &s;tricte&s;t View
of all that yet appears in publick,
does not &s;eem to be &s;o much as pre|tended

<P>While then it remains unenquir'd
into, who fir&s;t mov'd <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> to
enter into Mea&s;ures for making a
Peace; and the <HI>Queen</HI>'s undoubted
Prerogative empower'd <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI>
to enter into, and fini&s;h Negotiations
to that Purpo&s;e; It &s;eems, that all

Changes, by Way of Intriegue, or

with the more Di&s;gui&s;e; this would

the Honour of <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Word
in a mo&s;t gro&s;s and unju&s;tifiable
Manner; and if any &s;uch thing

have no other Work before him, than
to publi&s;h his Dete&s;tation of &s;uch
Practices, and wa&s;h his Hands
of the Guilt.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, it is humbly
conceiv'd, That all &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions

otherwi&s;e <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> would be un|der&s;tood

the <HI>Queen</HI> might at length be
alone in the War, under the literal
Obligation of tho&s;e Letters, Speeches,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But it was the Opinion of the
<HI>Queen</HI> at that Time, and of many of
Her Servants, That the Allies, par|ticularly
the <HI>States</HI> and the <HI>Emperor,</HI>
had not done their Part in the War;
and had not di&s;charg'd their Engage|ments
to <HI>Her Maje&s;ty;</HI> and even the
Parliament them&s;elves, in the Repre|&s;entation
of the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> to
the <HI>Queen,</HI> (Reference being had
thereto) did confirm that Opinion;
nay, <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> found, that no Com|plaint
from hence had the de&s;ir'd Ef|fect,
<PB N="77" REF="78">
to oblige the &s;aid Powers to
act in another Manner; but were
productive only of Memorials and

them&s;elves; and in the&s;e things are
&s;aid more particularly to be form'd
<HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI>'s fir&s;t Re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>Nor was this a Tran&s;action of that
Day only; it had been thus before:
And this <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> had long been
acquainted with, in the Time of the
Earl of <HI>Godolphin</HI>'s Admini&s;tration,
when, as has been credibly &s;aid, his
Lord&s;hip having frequently pre&s;&s;ed
tho&s;e Allies to perform the Conditi|ons
of the <HI>Grand Alliance;</HI> and to fur|ni&s;h
their <HI>Quota's</HI> and <HI>Contingents,</HI> as by
the &s;everal Conventions and Stipula|tions,
&s;ub&s;equent to the &s;aid Treaty of
<HI>Grand Alliance,</HI> they were oblig'd to
do; receiv'd for An&s;wer more than
once, and that to <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI>'s great
Grief; That their <HI>State</HI> was empo|veri&s;h'd;
that they were able to do
no more; and that unle&s;s his Lord&s;hip,
meaning the then <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> would
&s;upply the extraordinary Charge,
they could not carry on the War;
<PB N="78" REF="79">
and mu&s;t make their own Peace on
the be&s;t Conditions they could, or to
this Effect. If the&s;e things then were
ju&s;tifiable on the Part of any of <HI>Her
Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Allies; they were much more
to be defended on the Part of <HI>Her
Maje&s;ty,</HI> and Her Servants; though
they were led by the&s;e things in the
Method they were to take with the
&s;ame Allies, even by a natural Re|turn.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e
in the Methods taken
by &s;ome of the Allies, to reject, and
render ineffectual the Treaty for a
Peace, when it was &s;et on Foot at
<HI>&V;trecht;</HI> and to put an End to it by
the Operations of the Campaign; <HI>Her
Maje&s;ty</HI> thought She &s;aw &s;o re&s;olv'd a
Combination, not again&s;t a Peace
only, but even again&s;t a Treaty,
without enquiring whether it might
have been concluded to Advantage or
no; which combination <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI>
thought was not only incon&s;i&s;tent
with, but contrary to, the expre&s;s
Declaration of the <HI>States,</HI> of their be|ing
de&s;irous of Peace; that <HI>Her Ma|je&s;ty,</HI>
and likewi&s;e Her Servants, were
<PB N="79" REF="80">
of Opinion, That <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> was
ju&s;tly di&s;engag'd from all that had
been &s;aid, promi&s;ed, or &s;tipulated be|tween
them before; and was not at
Liberty only, but bound by the
&s;tricte&s;t of all the Obligations which
a good Prince could be bound by,
to provide for the Safety and Ea&s;e of
Her own Subjects, by a Peace, whe|ther
in Conjunction with, or &s;eparate
from tho&s;e Allies; in the mean Time,
neverthele&s;s, providing as well as
po&s;&s;ible, for the Satisfaction of all
Her Allies; if they thought fit to
come into Her Mea&s;ures, for their
own, and the general Satisfaction.</P>
<P>This may appear more e&s;pecially
from the In&s;tructions given to his
Grace the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> when he
went over <HI>General of Her Maje&s;ty</HI>'s
<HI>Forces;</HI> wherein his Grace's Orders
begin thus:</P>
<P>You are, with all po&s;&s;ible Diligence, to
repair to the <HI>Hague;</HI> and to acquaint
the <HI>Pen&s;ionary,</HI> That, having ap|pointed
you to command our Army in the
<HI>Netherlands,</HI> we have given you Orders
<PB N="80" REF="81">
to &s;ee him before you go to put your
&s;elf at the Head of the Troops. You are
to expre&s;s to him the Re&s;olution we are
in, of pre&s;&s;ing the War with all po&s;&s;ible
Vigour, until the Enemy &s;hall agree to
&s;uch Terms of Peace, as may be &s;afe and
honourable for us, and for our Allies.</P>
<P>You are farther to &s;ay to this Mini|&s;ter,
That you are prepar'd to live in a
perfect good Corre&s;pondence with all the
Generals of the Allies, and particularly
with tho&s;e of the <HI>States;</HI> and that you
hope, you &s;hall find the &s;ame Inclination
on their Part, to which his (the <HI>Pen&s;io|nary</HI>)
good Offices will extremely con|tribute.
You are, after this Introducti|on,
to de&s;ire the <HI>Pen&s;ionary</HI> to inform
you what Plan has been agreed upon for
the Operations of the Campaign.</P>
<P>The Duke, it &s;eem, is of Opini|on,
that when his Grace came to the
<HI>Hague,</HI> and, pur&s;uant to the&s;e In|&s;tructions,
communicated the <HI>Queen</HI>'s
Plea&s;ure, as well to the <HI>Pen&s;ionary,</HI> as
to the <HI>Deputies</HI> of the Council of
State, they declin'd him; receiv'd
the Propo&s;als in a manner le&s;s ob|liging
than <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> thought She
<PB N="81" REF="82">
had Rea&s;on to expect; and it is e|vident,
that they refus'd to commu|nicate
their Mea&s;ure to him, but re|ferr'd
him to the Deputies in their
Army; as may be &s;een in the Ac|count
given to the Publick by his
<HI>Grace,</HI> in his Book, Entitul'd;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. pag. 2 or 3.</NOTE> <HI>The
Couduct of the Duke of</HI> Ormond.</P>
<P>This Quotation is needful, in or|der
to &s;tate the Ca&s;e, as it then ap|pear'd
to <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Servants, at
the Time when Propo&s;als came over
from <HI>M. de Torcy,</HI> in the King of
<HI>France</HI>'s Name, in order to &s;et on
Foot a Negotiation for a Peace; and
which, by the <HI>Grand Alliance,</HI> Her
Maje&s;ty was not prohibited receiv|ing;
and, con&s;equently, the Mini&s;ters
could not be blam'd for receiving it
in <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Name; if, in the
Pur&s;uit of the Negotiations which have
follow'd, they have acted illegally,
that mu&s;t appear upon due Examina|tion,
and mu&s;t lie upon tho&s;e, who
it can be prov'd, by good Evidence,
were guilty.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="83">
The <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI>'s Part in the&s;e things,
can lie only in the general Tran&s;|action,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) The approving of the
entring upon the Treaty, the parti|cular
Negotiation not being his Pro|vince;
except that his Share above|mention'd,
which &s;eem'd to be rather
the Nece&s;&s;ity he found &s;ometimes to
rectify the Mi&s;takes which &s;ome,
by their private Divi&s;ions, and their
other Practices, had run them&s;elves
into, than that he manag'd any
Part of the Treaty: But the whole
Affair was tran&s;acted in the Council;
or by the <HI>Secretary of State;</HI> or by the
<HI>Queen</HI> through them both.</P>
<P>Moreover, it recurs back to what
is ob&s;erved before, That &s;uch was the
growing Breach among the <HI>Queen</HI>'s
Servants at this Time, that, not be|ing
in Terms of Peace with one a|nother,
they were ill qualify'd to con|&s;ult
one another in the Affair of mak|ing
Peace abroad; it is hop'd, for
their Sakes, they have made no Slips;
if it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, their Ene|mies
will not fail to make their Ad|vantage
thereof. But as to the <HI>Trea|&s;urer,</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="84">
it is evident, that as it was not
his Province to corre&s;pond with the
<HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> abroad; &s;o he is not to an|&s;wer
for tho&s;e that did.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem &s;trange, that in car|rying
on this Account of the <HI>Con|duct
of this Mini&s;ter,</HI> who Fame has
&s;o often &s;poken of, as at the Head of
all Affairs, it has not yet occurr'd
to &s;peak of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> or &s;o much
as once to mention &s;uch a Per&s;on;
but that he &s;eems to lie out of the
Que&s;tion, as much as if there were
no &s;uch Per&s;on in the World; and
this is the more wonderful, becau&s;e
of the Pains which has been taken
in the World, to load the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI>
with the Guilt of this, among the
re&s;t; and even to a&s;&s;ure the World,
that this, among other things, would
be prov'd upon him, as clear as the
Sun at Noon Day; notwith&s;tanding
which, &s;ome of his Enemies acknow|ledge
now, that even in all the Ex|aminations
into that Matter, that they
do not &s;ee, that one Step, in Favour
of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> can be prov'd upon
him; neither do we find yet, that
<PB N="84" REF="85">
tho&s;e appointed to examine into it,
have charg'd him with any thing of
that kind.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t which the Examinations
which have been taken of that Mat|ter
&s;eem to import, amount to no
more than this; That &s;ome People
in the Mini&s;try knew of, or con|niv'd
at his being permitted to
re&s;ide in the Dominions of the Duke
of <HI>Lorrain:</HI> But all of them grant,
that in all the Negotiations, they
were &s;trictly enjoin'd to in&s;i&s;t upon
his being oblig'd to quit the Domi|nions
of <HI>France;</HI> &s;o that they do not
pretend to any thing done in the
Treaty in his Favour, or of that
kind, that could be u&s;eful to his De|&s;ign;
nor is it alledg'd, that the Ob|ligations
laid on the <HI>French</HI> King, not
any Ways to aid or a&s;&s;i&s;t him, or to
admit his Return, are not as full
and as pungent, as Words could ex|pre&s;s;
which Treaty therefore being
&s;o calculated to remove the <HI>Pre|tender</HI>
from the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
<HI>French,</HI> and from his Dominions,
&s;eem'd to an&s;wer all the Ends of the
<PB N="85" REF="86">
mo&s;t fixed and re&s;olv'd Enemies to
his Intere&s;t, not valuing whether he
might think fit to go; &s;eeing if the
<HI>French</HI> King kept his Word invio|lably,
his near Re&s;idence in <HI>Lorrain</HI>
would be of &s;mall Advantage to
him; and if otherwi&s;e, his remoter
Re&s;idence could have been no more
Ob&s;truction to him, than the Diffe|rence
of a few Days in his Journey,
when he &s;hould have been recall'd;
adding withal, that at the remoter
Di&s;tance of <HI>Rome,</HI> or <HI>Venice,</HI> he would,
with much greater Ea&s;e, have re|mov'd
without Notice, and been
able to have pa&s;s'd <HI>incognito,</HI> when|ever
he had any De&s;ign &s;o to do,
than he can do where he now is.</P>
<P>So that on the whole; As in the
Treaty they took effectual Care to
tie up the <HI>French</HI> King, from giving
any A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and
put the Nece&s;&s;ity upon him, of ba|ni&s;hing
him for ever from his Domi|nions,
the <HI>Queen</HI> &s;eem'd to have
done all that was of Movement to be
done; and if any one conniv'd at
the Place of his Re&s;idence, in Fa|vour
<PB N="86" REF="87">
of his pretending to the Crown
of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> &s;uch an one was &s;o
far guilty of a trayterous Confede|racy
with the <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
<P>It is ob&s;erv'd by &s;ome, that the Af|fair
of the <HI>Pretender</HI> was the Pro|vince
of the Abbot <HI>Gautier,</HI> who was
a <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ter re&s;iding here dur|ing
the Negotiations; but it dose not
yet appear, or at lea&s;t we do not
find, that any thing was tran&s;acted
for him, but what related to the
Place where he &s;hould go; and that
&s;o as he might not be &s;urpriz'd by
the <HI>Emperor;</HI> and even this &s;eems to
have been left undecided; and that
the <HI>Queen</HI> afterwards finding it was
the Occa&s;ion of Unea&s;ine&s;s among
Her People, did earne&s;tly pre&s;s to
have him remov'd; all which can
afford but &s;mall Ground to &s;ugge&s;t,
as is done, That the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> had a
re&s;erv'd De&s;ign to make him King
of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>This, however, not at all affect|ing
the <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> had not been men|tion'd
in this Place, but to remind
<PB N="87" REF="88">
the Reader of the Injury the <HI>Trea|&s;urer</HI>
receiv'd, during the Time of
the&s;e Negotiations, as well as &s;ince,
in being openly reflected on, as in
the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender;</HI> where|as,
upon the narrowe&s;t Scrutiny, it
is believ'd it will appear, that not
one Step has been, at any time,
taken by him; or that the lea&s;t Sha|dow
of any thing will be found,
that looks like favouring that Per&s;on's
Intere&s;t: On the other Hand, it is
apparent, That the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> has all
along been hated and malign'd by
the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party here, as their
greate&s;t and mo&s;t dangerous Enemy;
that they openly rejoic'd when he
was di&s;mi&s;s'd from the high Station
which he acted in before; and that
as &s;oon as the fir&s;t Divi&s;ion among
the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> appear'd, they eminent|ly
&s;hew'd them&s;elves again&s;t the
<HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> and in the Intere&s;t of the
other; which was a Te&s;timony of
the be&s;t kind, <HI>namely, of the Enemy</HI> in
Behalf of the <HI>Trea&s;urer;</HI> and &s;ignifi|ed,
that if they had any Hopes of
their Intere&s;t in any Side, it was in
tho&s;e who were now oppo&s;ing the
<PB N="88" REF="89">
<HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> to the utmo&s;t: The&s;e things,
if any thing will do it, may open
the Eyes of &s;ome Men, to &s;ee the In|ju&s;tice
they have done to the <HI>Trea&s;u|rer</HI>
in the&s;e things; and how inju|riou&s;ly
he has been all along treated
by them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> &s;tanding in this Po|&s;ture,
with re&s;pect to the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI>
at Home, in cannot be &s;uppos'd but
that many things, in the Tran&s;action
of the <HI>Peace,</HI> were actually done,
not without his Con&s;ent only, but
that he entirely declin'd to inter|meddle
with tho&s;e things which he
did not approve. It was, no doubt,
the Duty of the <HI>Plenipotentiaries,</HI> to
leave &s;uch Articles as they could
not legally adju&s;t, to the Parliament
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to ratify, or reject;
and therefore the VIII and IX Ar|ticles
of the Treaty of Commerce,
which related to the taking off of
<HI>Duties</HI> on &s;everal <HI>Merchandizes</HI> im|ported,
could not be finally con|cluded,
or otherwi&s;e &s;ettled, than
by referring them to the Parliament,
by whom the &s;everal <HI>Duties</HI> being ap|propriated
<PB N="89" REF="90">
to particular Purpo&s;es, could
alone be taken off: But when the&s;e
things came to be laid before the
Parliament, it &s;eems, it was Subject of
great Complaint again&s;t the <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI>
that he was unwilling, or declin'd to
have the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> e&s;pou&s;e the making
tho&s;e Articles effectual; whereas it was
the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI>'s Opinion, That the <HI>Mi|ni&s;try</HI>
&s;hould entirely leave the Mer|chants
to act as they thought fit; and
leave the Hou&s;e to act at the Merchants
Reque&s;ts, and as their own Wi&s;dome &s;hould
direct them; the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> &s;tanding
entirely neuter.</P>
<P>But this likewi&s;e he was over-rul'd
in; and the re&s;t of the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI>
thinking them&s;elves oblig'd to &s;upport
at Home, what they had tran&s;acted
Abroad, brought in their whole Strength
into the Debate, and, making it a
Party Affair, lo&s;t it in the <HI>Hou&s;e of
Commons,</HI> by that very Means, and
no other: In all which Matter, the
<HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> remain'd pa&s;&s;ive, and un|concern'd;
though with this Inju&s;tice
al&s;o on him, <HI>viz.</HI> That he &s;uffer'd
the Reproaches of the Whigs, for e|&s;pou&s;ing
<PB N="90" REF="91">
the <HI>Bill of Commerce;</HI> and
of the other Part of the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> for
not e&s;pou&s;ing it.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to go through
the Detail of the&s;e particular Ca&s;es,
in which the Province of the <HI>Trea&s;u|rer</HI>
was no other, than to bear infi|nite
Calumny for tho&s;e Follies, which
he had no Share in, but had not
Power to prevent; and this made him
frequently &s;ay, That <HI>he was out of
Office near a Year before he was out of
Place;</HI> and indeed, for &s;ome of the
la&s;t Months that he remain'd in the
Place, he had little to do in the pub|lick
Affairs, but to complain of this
injurious U&s;age, <HI>viz.</HI> That he was ob|lig'd
to &s;ee things done that he could
not approve of; and then to hear
them call'd his Doing.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e Unhappine&s;&s;es he be|came
an humble Petitioner to <HI>Her
Maje&s;ty,</HI> either to deliver him from
the&s;e Men, or to di&s;mi&s;s him from
the Service: At fir&s;t he prevail'd, to
their great Unea&s;ine&s;s, to have a new
Settlement of Great Officers made;
<PB N="91" REF="92">
which, as he knew it overthrew the
Schemes which the other People had
laid; &s;o he had Hopes it would, at length,
put the Affairs in a Cour&s;e of Ma|nagement,
as would retrieve the Con|fu&s;ion
they were at that time in:
This was when <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> appoint|ed
the Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> Lieutenant
of <HI>Ireland;</HI> Lord <HI>Finlater,</HI> to be Chan|cellor
of <HI>Scotland;</HI> the Earl of <HI>Marr,</HI>
third Secretary of State; Lord <HI>Dart|mouth,</HI>
Lord Privy Seal; and Mr. <HI>Brom|ley,</HI>
Secretary of State, in Lord <HI>Dart|mouth</HI>'s
Room; Sir <HI>William Wyndham,</HI>
Chancellor of the <HI>Exchequer;</HI> and the
Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> to command in chief
in <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Out|rage
of the other Per&s;ons, who now
own'd they look'd but like a FA|CTION
in the <HI>Mini&s;try;</HI> but gave
out threatning Speeches plentifully,
that they would &s;oon de&s;troy this
new Scheme: The Trouble likewi&s;e
which this gave to the <HI>Queen</HI> Her&s;elf,
cannot be &s;poken of without Grief;
e&s;pecially when it mu&s;t be remember|ed,
how near it was to that fatal Di|&s;temper
<PB N="92" REF="93">
which remov'd <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI>
to a Throne, uncapable of &s;uch Per|turbation
and Di&s;&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>It was not indeed very long e're
<HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> perceiv'd that they
would never cea&s;e attacking Her on
the&s;e Heads, and began &s;omething to
yield to their Importunities; which
the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> perceiving, renew'd his
Applications to <HI>Her Maje&s;ty,</HI> to the
&s;ame Purpo&s;e as before: And in this
Interval it was, that he receiv'd <HI>Her
Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Command, to lay before Her
a true State of Her Affairs; which
Command he cheerfully obey'd, in
Hopes the doing &s;o might either for|tify
<HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Re&s;olutions in the
Model of Admini&s;tration lately enter'd
upon, or replace him&s;elf in that Re|ce&s;s
from Bu&s;ine&s;s, and from the Scan|dal
of other Mens Mi&s;takes, which he
&s;o much de&s;ir'd.</P>

Thus ended a trouble&s;ome Admini|&s;tration
of a few Years; in which the

the Place, but never could execute the
Office; and though it is true, that
he had all the Envy, and bore the
Weight of all the evil Conduct of o|ther
Men; yet nothing can be truer,
than that they not only influenc'd
the publick Affairs, di&s;tinctly from
him; but that they carry'd every
thing their own Way, even over the
Belly of the <HI>Trea&s;urer;</HI> and had the
particular Direction of tho&s;e things,
of which he had the Scandal, for all
their ill Management lies at his Door,
in the E&s;teem of his Enemies; and is,
to this Hour, improv'd to his Hurt,
as much as &s;ome <HI>Men</HI> are able.</P>
<P>It was, as has been &s;aid, but a &s;hort
while after this Repre&s;entation to <HI>Her
Maje&s;ty,</HI> that the <HI>Queen</HI> thought fit to
accept the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI>'s Ce&s;&s;ion of the
<HI>Staff;</HI> a certain Evidence, that their
Influence had a prevailing Force with
<HI>Her Maje&s;ty,</HI> who would never el&s;e
have con&s;ented to admit &s;uch <HI>Men</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="97">
into Her Admini&s;tration, who, it had
been prov'd, had defrauded the Pub|lick
of above 20000 Pounds in Mo|ney
but ju&s;t before; and who had &s;o
evidently been detected in that Fraud
by him, who <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> &s;uffer'd to
lay down.</P>
<P>From hence it is argu'd, That the
Knowledge of the&s;e things was one
Rea&s;on, why the <HI>Queen,</HI> after the

yet &s;uch a Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t tho&s;e

Death intervening, &s;urpriz'd them all;
put an End to all their projected
Schemes at once; and, among the
re&s;t, had this one Unhappine&s;s, that it
prevented the late <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> and de|priv'd
him of the Opportunity of
convincing <HI>Her Maje&s;ty,</HI> by the Con&s;e|quences
of the fatal Tendency of the&s;e
Councils; and how naturally they
would embroil Her Affairs, both at
Home and Abroad.</P>
<P>Upon the pre&s;ent Enquiries made
by the Authority of Parliament into
the&s;e Matters, it &s;eems, that &s;ome of
the&s;e Men have not Confidence enough
in the Ju&s;tice of their own Mea&s;ures,
<PB N="98" REF="99">
to defend them in a Parliamentary
Manner; but have retir'd, for the
pre&s;ent; whether it &s;hall be con&s;tru'd
to &s;ignify, their pleading guilty to the
Charge, &s;hall not be enter'd into
here; but certain it is, that they
mu&s;t know the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> may have
&s;omething to &s;ay to them, which
they are not very well di&s;pos'd to
hear.</P>
<P>The <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> not doubting the
Ju&s;tice of tho&s;e, who the Laws of this
Nation have made Judges of the&s;e
things, <HI>APPEARS,</HI> and manife&s;ts
thereby his Readine&s;s to ca&s;t his
Life, his Honour, and his Fortunes,
upon the Honour and Impartiality of
the Peerage of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> as be|ing
a&s;&s;ur'd, that nothing &s;hall be there
laid upon him, which cannot be fixt
by the Te&s;timony of good Witne&s;&s;es;
and that he &s;hall not be cen&s;ur'd by
their Lord&s;hips for tho&s;e Tran&s;actions,
which have been the Work of other
Hands; and that he &s;hall not only
have full Scope given him, for clear|ing
up his Innocence in all the Points
charged again&s;t him; but likewi&s;e a
<PB N="99" REF="100">
Liberty to bring to open View, the
Steps which have been taken by his
Enemies, not only towards the Ruin
of their Country; but al&s;o towards
vindicating them&s;elves, by laying their
own Crimes at his Door; in which
Defence, no que&s;tion, not only all
the&s;e things will be placed in a fuller
and clearer Light; but many other
things be brought into View, which
have hitherto been either concealed,
or very ill under&s;tood.</P>
