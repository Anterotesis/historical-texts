<HEAD>AN
ESSAY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN order to enquire Critically into the
Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice, as well as Con&s;e|quences,
of an <HI>Occa&s;ional Bill,</HI> or an
Act to prevent the Occa&s;ional Conformity
of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate
as di&s;tinctly, and in a Method as unex|ceptionable
as may be, the <HI>Nature</HI> and
<HI>Original</HI> of the Thing call'd <HI>Occa&s;ional Con|formity,</HI>
and by what Steps the pre&s;ent
Debates about it, have come upon the
Stage.</P>
<P>That this may be done with as little Of|fence
as po&s;&s;ible, we &s;hall deduce things in
a brief Hi&s;torical Narration from undoubted
Te&s;timony of Fact, recent to the Memory
of mo&s;t ob&s;erving Men in this Age, and
not to be contradicted by the fal&s;e Glo&s;&s;es
or Mi&s;repre&s;entations of any: And if by
this it &s;hould appear, that the following
are undoubted Truths of unque&s;tion'd Au|thority,
<PB N="4" REF="3">
then all the Vehemence which &s;ome
have u&s;ed, in pre&s;enting the &s;everal Acts
again&s;t <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity,</HI> will appear &s;o
many Attempts, <HI>Whether knowingly or igno|rantly,
is not to the Purpo&s;e,</HI> again&s;t the
Con&s;titution, and again&s;t the ju&s;t Right of
their Country; <HI>That is to &s;ay,</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. If it it appears, That the Act of Par|liament
called <HI>The Te&s;t-Act,</HI> has been in|verted
by the Sini&s;ter De&s;igns of a Party
among us, and being in its true Intent and
Meaning formed again&s;t <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Recu&s;ants
only, has been turned again&s;t our Fellow
Prote&s;tants, to the weakning and injuring
the Intere&s;t of the Prote&s;tant Religion in
general in this Kingdom;</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If it appears, That it is a Law un|ju&s;t
in its own Nature, and incon&s;i&s;tent
with the Native Rights of the Subjects of
<HI>England,</HI> as well as with the Sovereignty
of Con&s;cience, which ought not to be im|po&s;ed
upon;</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If it appears incon&s;i&s;tent with the
Chri&s;tian Religion, and with the Princi|ples
and Doctrine of the Church of <HI>Eng|land;</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4.
If the manner in which it is put in
Practice appears to be a Plot again&s;t the
Peace of the Nation, and a con&s;tant Han|dle
<PB N="5" REF="4">
to the Strife of Parties, and Oppre&s;&s;i|on
of the Innocent.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>If upon an Impartial Enquiry into the
Hi&s;tory of this Law, the&s;e things &s;hould
appear, then it may be worth our Con&s;i|deration,
whether we &s;hould &s;till pur&s;ue a
thing &s;o fatal to the General Good, and be
for ever Sacrificing one another to the Re|&s;entment
of Parties, robbing each other of
the Peace, Liberty, and Birthright of <HI>Eng|li&s;h-men,</HI>
under the Forms, but contrary
to the true Intent and Meaning of the
Law.</P>
<P>From this &s;hort Introduction, and in or|der
to lay the&s;e Things more plainly before
us, That <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tants may &s;ee what
they are doing, and may not &s;acrifice one
another to the Intere&s;ts of the Enemies of
both; We proceed to ran&s;ack from the
Beginning, the Records of the&s;e Things,
that the Truth being brought forth into a
clear Light, and viewed with open unblind|ed
Eyes, the pre&s;ent Generation may have
none to blame but them&s;elves, if they pull
down the Liberties and Religion of their
Ance&s;tors with their own Hands.</P>
<P>After the Re&s;toration of King <HI>Charles</HI> II.
had been for &s;ome Years perfected, and the
Court as well as the Kingdom was gotten
<PB N="6" REF="5">
over their fir&s;t Tran&s;ports, enjoy'd a full
Dominion over the <HI>Puritan-Party,</HI> as they
call'd them, and had for two or three Years
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed the Remains of them by &s;evere
Pro&s;ecutions of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> &s;uppre&s;&s;ing <HI>Con|venticles,</HI>
Fining, Impri&s;oning, and Con|fi&s;cating
the Hearers, and Bani&s;hing, as
by the Corporation-Act, their Mini&s;ters
or Preachers Five Miles from every con&s;i|derable
Town, and the like; the Nobility
and Gentry of <HI>England</HI> began to &s;ee, that
while their Eyes had been taken up with
pur&s;uing the&s;e le&s;&s;er Evils of <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> in Re|ligion
among Prote&s;tants, they had, as the
Con&s;equence of &s;uch Proceedings generally
proves, in&s;en&s;ibly &s;uffered the &s;ecret En|croachments
of <HI>Rome</HI> and of <HI>France,</HI> and
opened a Door to <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Tyranny.</HI></P>
<P>It would be too tedious a thing to un|dertake
here, what all our Hi&s;tories are full
of, <HI>viz.</HI> To give an Account by what in|&s;en&s;ible
Degrees the King (influenc'd by the
Council of his Brother a declared <HI>Papist,</HI>
and by his own Re&s;olutions, him&s;elf as ap|pear'd
at his Death, being &s;ecretly a <HI>Papist,</HI>
an Account whereof &s;hall in the&s;e Tracts be
at large made Publick) &s;uffer'd him&s;elf and
all his Councils to be acted and managed
by the Artifice of <HI>France,</HI> and being him|&s;elf
a Pen&s;ioner to the King of <HI>France,</HI>
brought his whole Kingdom to be pa&s;&s;ively
<PB N="7" REF="6">
&s;ub&s;ervient, and actively a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the Ri|&s;ing
Exorbitance of that Prince, who&s;e
Power &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted, has &s;ince grown too great
for all <HI>Europe,</HI> and has co&s;t this &s;ame Nati|on,
who&s;e Blood and Valour a&s;&s;i&s;ted them,
<HI>to ri&s;e</HI> &s;o much Blood and Trea&s;ure &s;ince
<HI>to reduce.</HI></P>
<P>At length, tho' late, the People of <HI>En|gland</HI>
took the Alarm, when in the Year
1672, the King of <HI>France</HI> made that dread|ful
Eruption into <HI>Holland,</HI> attacking the
<HI>Dutch</HI> with three formidable Armies at once,
without any Provocation, any Satisfaction
demanded, or Cau&s;e a&s;&s;ign'd, &s;ave that he
was ill &s;atisfied in them.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t of this War we wretchedly
a&s;&s;i&s;ted <HI>France,</HI> not only by Land, but de|clared
War again&s;t the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and fell up|on
them by Sea, in a manner too di&s;honou|rable
for an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> to &s;ay much of, <HI>viz.</HI>
falling upon their <HI>Smyrna</HI> Fleet, while in
full Peace they might be &s;uppo&s;ed to come
&s;ecurely into our Channel, if not into our
very Harbours. The re&s;t we choo&s;e to co|ver
with a Hand of Charity, rather than
expo&s;e the Nakedne&s;s of tho&s;e Times, more
than the Nece&s;&s;ity of the pre&s;ent Argument
obliges us to.</P>
<P>The Succe&s;&s;es of <HI>France</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI>
reduc'd the States to the Brink of Ruine,
and <HI>Naerden</HI> being taken by the Duke of
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> it was expected, that <HI>Am&s;ter|dam,</HI>
which was but 12 Miles off, would
have &s;ent Deputies to make their Submi&s;&s;ion
to <HI>France.</HI> But in this Interim the Ma&s;&s;acre
of the <HI>de Witts,</HI> and the Ruine of the <HI>Barna|velt</HI>
Faction intervening, the Prince of <HI>O|range,</HI>
afterwards King <HI>William</HI> of Glorious
Memory, a Prince born for the Re&s;cuing
oppre&s;s'd Nations, and for a Refuge to the
Prote&s;tant Religion, was re&s;tor'd to the Ad|mini&s;tration
of the Affairs in <HI>Holland,</HI> revi|ved
the Courage of the de&s;ponding People,
and in a little time drove the <HI>French</HI> as fa&s;t
out of the Country, as they came in.</P>
<P>The&s;e things, and the Progre&s;s of the
<HI>French</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> alarm'd <HI>England,</HI> as we
hinted above, and put us upon Enquiring
into our State at Home; Endeavours were
us'd to bring <HI>England</HI> over, and the Pul&s;e of
the People in Parliament beat &s;o high again&s;t
<HI>France,</HI> that the Court was oblig'd to make
a &s;hew of Changing Sides; Peace was made
with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> an Offer of Marriage of the
Prince&s;s <HI>Mary,</HI> afterwards Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> to
the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and &s;everal mea&s;ures
taken, which look'd like a War with
<HI>France,</HI> tho' nothing le&s;s intended.</P>
<P>An Army was rais'd, Three Millions &s;e|ven
hundred thou&s;and Pounds given by Par|liament
for the Carrying it on; but &s;uch
hold had the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Councils
<PB N="9" REF="8">
gotten in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, that all the
Means which were po&s;&s;ible to be u&s;ed
could never get the King to Declare War,
but at la&s;t ended all in the Treaty of <HI>Nime|guen,</HI>
a Peace wholly to the Advantage of
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>During the&s;e Tran&s;actions, the Patriots
of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in this Nation,
finding the Influence which <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Popi&s;h</HI>
Emi&s;&s;aries had on the King, and finding
the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Lords in the Hou&s;e always vigo|rous
to oppo&s;e every thing which was for
the advancing the new Mea&s;ures, they ap|ply'd
them&s;elves to &s;everal Methods, in
order to weaken the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Party. They
could not yet obtain an Act to prevent the
<HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Lords Sitting in the Hou&s;e, but the
pre&s;ent Ca&s;e was to prevent <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Officers
in the Army; who were &s;o many, and be|haved
&s;o In&s;olently, that the Army then
rai&s;ed and incamp'd at <HI>Black-Heath,</HI> under
a Pretence of the War with <HI>France,</HI> was
become a Terror to the People, and was
called the <HI REND="blackletterType">Cut-throat Army.</HI></P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> who till then had
been one of the Five Capital Letters, which
formed the Word CABAL, was the
Man who contriv'd and brought in the
Propo&s;al for a Bill to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e <HI>Popi&s;h</HI>
Officers: And the Title of the Act expre&s;|&s;ed
the Meaning and De&s;ign of its being
<PB N="10" REF="9">
brought in. The King, the Court, and all
the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, oppo&s;ed it
with all their Might; but the Popular
Terror, and the ju&s;t Fear the People were
in of a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Army, prevailed, and it pa&s;s'd
by a great Majority; neither did the King
think fit to oppo&s;e him&s;elf to the Stream of
the whole Nation at that time, e&s;pecially
there being a great Money-Bill then de|pending
in the Hou&s;e, for no le&s;s than
1238750<HI>l.</HI> which would have been lo&s;t.
So the Bill pa&s;s'd, 25 <HI>Carol.</HI> 2. and is Inti|tled,
<HI>An Act for preventing Dangers which
may ari&s;e from Popi&s;h Recu&s;ants.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Famous <HI REND="blackletterType">Te&s;t-Act</HI>; and that
the true Intent and Meaning of this Act,
and the Rea&s;on of its making, may more
plainly appear, the Preamble to the Act is
thus; <HI REND="blackletterType">For Preventing Dangers which
may happen from Popi&s;h Recu&s;ants,
and for quieting the Minds of His
Maje&s;ties good Subjects</HI>; The <HI>&V;nea&s;i|ne&s;s
of His Maje&s;ties good Subjects,</HI> was at
that time manife&s;t to be their Fears of the
Army and Court being put into the Hands
of <HI>Papi&s;ts;</HI> and the People who pu&s;h'd on
the Act, were tho&s;e very People, who e&s;|pou&s;ing
Liberty and Property, obtain'd in
Contempt from the Court-Party the Name
of <HI REND="blackletterType">Whiggs.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
But further to explain this Matter, the
Court, which with all po&s;&s;ible Management
and Art oppo&s;ed this Law, endeavour'd to
alarm the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> with their Danger
from this Act; and Alderman <HI>LOVE,</HI> Re|pre&s;entative
for the City of <HI>London,</HI> a Man
of un&s;potted Integrity, was privately &s;po|ken
to, that he might oppo&s;e it on behalf
of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters:</HI> This at fir&s;t had &s;ome
Effect on the People; but Mr. <HI>Love</HI> &s;eeing
into the De&s;ign avoided it, and would not
meddle; on the other hand, the Per&s;ons
who brought in the Bill, a&s;&s;ured the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters,</HI>
there was no De&s;ign to offer them
any Di&s;turbance, and that if they de&s;ired
it, they would bring in another Bill after|wards,
to exempt them from the Penalties
of the &s;aid Act, repre&s;enting to them at
the &s;ame time, That if they &s;truck in to
oppo&s;e this Act, the Bill again&s;t <HI>Popery</HI>
would be lo&s;t, and both they and the Church
of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould fall together, under the
growing Mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing from the Power
of <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> in the Court.</P>
<P>The <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> prevailed upon with the&s;e
Arguments, and e&s;pecially depending upon
the Promi&s;es of the <HI>Church-men,</HI> (Unhappy
Credulity!) that the Act had no View
towards them, and &s;hould in no wi&s;e be
turned upon them, acquie&s;c'd, and to &s;ave
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;acrific'd them&s;elves
<PB N="12" REF="11">
and their Po&s;terity, to the Ingratitude of
tho&s;e that propo&s;ed it to them. Ju&s;t thus the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;uffered them&s;elves to
be prevailed upon in the &s;ame Ca&s;e, rather
than to lo&s;e that happy Bill la&s;t pa&s;t there
to prevent the Growth of <HI>Popery;</HI> into the
middle of which, a certain Noble Per&s;on
then in the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> and lately become a
Convert to a <HI>Principle</HI> perfectly new to
what he formerly profe&s;t, thru&s;t into the
middle of that Act, thereby to throw out
all the Faithful Subjects of the Government,
who &s;pent their E&s;tates, and &s;ome of their
Blood in the Defence of <HI>London-Derry,</HI> a|gain&s;t
the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Army of King <HI>James,</HI>
from being tru&s;ted with the Magi&s;tracy of
the City they defended.</P>
<P>In this manner, and on this Occa&s;ion,
and no other, this Act was pa&s;&s;ed, which is
now become &s;o much the Favourite of a
Party, as to be thought the great Defence
of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> how and by
what Degrees it became &s;o, may not be
improper to enquire.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome Years after the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ing
of this Act, 'ere the Effects of it on the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> were much taken notice of; and
during the fir&s;t 10 Years afterwards, the
Capitulation of tho&s;e Per&s;ons who brought
it in was pretty well ob&s;erved: And tho'
&s;everal Per&s;ecutions happen'd in that time
<PB N="13" REF="12">
upon the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> by Virtue of other
Penal Laws which were turned again&s;t
them, yet this Part of the Law was not
much in&s;i&s;ted on till about the Year 82,
and 83, when the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Plot being turn'd
into Ridicule, and &s;everal Plots trumped
up upon the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> partly to turn the
Odium of that Plot upon them, and part|ly
to &s;uppre&s;s them as a Party joyning with
the <HI REND="blackletterType">Whigs,</HI> e&s;pecially when the Court
undertook the modelling of Corporations,
and brought Writs of <HI>Quo-Warranto</HI> again&s;t
the Charters of Towns: Then this Law
was turned full-but upon the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and
with all imaginable Eagerne&s;s in&s;i&s;ted upon,
even &s;o much as to the Common-Council
Men of the City of <HI>London;</HI> nay, they be|gan
to talk, or offer at, allowing no Citi|zens
to Vote for Common-Council Men
or Aldermen, but &s;uch as had taken the
Sacrament; and to run it to all po&s;&s;ible Ex|tremities,
they went this Length, That no
Man &s;hould be allow'd a Licen&s;e to keep
an <HI>Ale-Hou&s;e,</HI> unle&s;s he had taken the Sa|crament
of the Church; and &s;everal &s;ad
Stories are left upon Record, of Per&s;ons
falling into De&s;pair, Melancholy and
Madne&s;s, for having acted again&s;t their
Con&s;ciences in that Ca&s;e; till at la&s;t
it was &s;aid, a poor profligate Wretch
found out an Expedient for it, and finding a
Prie&s;t with as little Religion as him&s;elf,
<PB N="14" REF="13">
communicated with him, profe&s;&s;ing to take
it as no Religious Act, for that he owned
he was not fit to do it; acknowledging him|&s;elf
a Scandalous Sinner, but that being
forced to do it, or lo&s;e his Licen&s;e, which
was his Livelyhood, he took it as common
Bread and Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are other
Scandalous In&s;tances of the Severity of
tho&s;e Times, which we omit, being not
willing to aggravate the Grief of tho&s;e
things.</P>
<P>By the publick Management of the&s;e
Times, this Act was thus brought on the
Stage, as if made on purpo&s;e for the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters,</HI>
while at the &s;ame time the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> a|gain&s;t
whom it had really been made, were
upon every Occa&s;ion forborn, conniv'd at,
and overlook'd; and all Attempts to pro&s;e|cute
the Law again&s;t them di&s;courag'd and
di&s;countenanc'd.</P>
<P>This continued during the whole Reign
of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and in King <HI>James</HI>'s
Reign, till the Defeat of the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth,</HI>
when the King in his Speech to the
Parliament, fairly told the Hou&s;e, He could
not want the Service of the Gentlemen of
his own Religion, and openly Di&s;pen&s;ing
with this Law in the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> cajol'd the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> with their &s;hare of the Liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
Some of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> it mu&s;t be al|lowed,
were &s;o far partial to their own Ea&s;e,
as not to con&s;ider that it was given them at
the Expence of the Con&s;titution, and that
their enjoying the Relaxation of Penal Sta|tutes
by the Breath of the King, was a
&s;topping their Mouths again&s;t the open
Breaches of the Law, and effectually taking
from them any Argument they might u&s;e
again&s;t the Di&s;pen&s;ing Power, or the pulling
down all the Fortifications of our Laws
again&s;t <HI>Popery,</HI> and Arbitrary Govern|ment.</P>
<P>But
their Eyes were &s;oon open'd, and
they &s;aw the Mi&s;take time enough to
joyn heartily with the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
in re&s;toring the Liberties of their Coun|try,
and overthrowing the projected E&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of <HI>Popery;</HI> and then followed the
<HI REND="blackletterType">Revolution.</HI></P>
<P>During the whole Reign of King <HI>William,</HI>
the <HI>Te&s;t-Act</HI> &s;lept in its Native Circum|&s;tance,
its fir&s;t De&s;ign in keeping <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI>
out of Publick Employment, out of Par|liament,
Army, and Civil Li&s;t, was effectu|ally
an&s;wer'd: But the corrupt turning the
Edge upon the <HI REND="blackletterType">Di&s;&s;enters</HI> was di&s;coun|tenanc'd,
as what was <HI>not only</HI> not the
Intere&s;t of the Nation, but as what was not
the true Rea&s;on or Intent and Meaning
of the Bill. The King, who had a native
<PB N="16" REF="15">
Aver&s;ion to all Religious Coercion, had
al&s;o the le&s;s Inclination to pu&s;h the Se|verity
of this Law upon the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI>
becau&s;e he knew in the Original Making
that Law, it was not in the View either of
the People, or of the Sovereign, to give them
the lea&s;t Di&s;turbance on that Account.</P>
<P>Yet here the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> committed ano|ther
Error; for as if they were ea&s;ier in
their Compliance, in that they were not
at all compell'd, they voluntarily comply'd
with the Law, tho' they were &s;ure no Man
would meet with Encouragement in pro&s;e|cuting
them for the Omi&s;&s;ion; nor do we
find in all this time any Pro&s;ecution com|menced
again&s;t any Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enter,
for taking or executing any Office or Place,
whether Civil or Military, without taking
the Sacrament.</P>
<P>This obtain'd the Name of <HI REND="blackletterType">Occa&s;ional
Conformity</HI>; but the Freedom with which
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> qualified them&s;elves, at their
entring into &s;uch Offices, tho' there &s;eem'd
no Danger in the Omi&s;&s;ion, gave Offence;
fir&s;t to their own Friends, e&s;pecially among
tho&s;e, who having a more &s;trict regard to
their Principles, look'd upon it as an Incon|&s;i&s;tency
with their profe&s;&s;ed Di&s;&s;ent from
the Church, who complained openly, that
&s;uch who could on meer Occa&s;ion of Pre|ferment,
and to &s;hun a Penalty Conform,
<PB N="17" REF="16">
ought not to be receiv'd again into the
Communion of particular Congregations,
but as Penitents.</P>
<P>There were many who took up the Wea|pons
again&s;t this Objection, and thought to
ma&s;ter it with Arguments drawn from
General Charity: But however they might
prove the Legality of a Communion of
Charity with all Orthodox Chri&s;tians; or
a General Communion with the whole
Chri&s;tian Church; yet it is mo&s;t certain,
no full An&s;wer could be given to that
Part of <HI REND="blackletterType">Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> which
was &s;ubmitted to by Per&s;ons otherwi&s;e
Di&s;&s;enting from the Church, meerly to
quality for Preferment and Places in the
Government, which was the Sum of the
Di&s;pute at that time.</P>
<P>This Argument therefore being directly
again&s;t them, became exceeding Popular,
and e&s;pecially it appear'd a little new to
find the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> them&s;elves vigorou&s;ly Di&s;|puting
for <HI>Conformity</HI> to that very <HI REND="blackletterType">Church</HI>
which they &s;tatedly &s;eparated from.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty come to
the Crown, but the Enemies of the <HI>Toleration,</HI>
having as they thought, an opportunity to op|pre&s;s
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> began here; They found
nothing &s;o proper to render them hated
and odious to the People, as the Charge
of Hypocri&s;y, and therefore immediately
<PB N="18" REF="17">
took hold of this, as an Advantage
which offered again&s;t the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and
that would make their Proceeding again&s;t
them popular and &s;pecious: And this in|troduced
the fir&s;t <HI REND="blackletterType">Occa&s;ional Bill.</HI></P>
<P>Now as all Extreams in the unhappy Divi|&s;ions
of this Nation, have been fatal to the
common Liberty of the whole, as well as to
the Parties them&s;elves, who run unadvi&s;edly
into them: So here, as the <HI>Occca&s;ional Confor-</HI>
of tho&s;e <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in general, who run to
the Sacrament in that prophane manner,
meerly for a Qualification, grew &s;canda|lous
and hateful, even to their own Bre|thren,
who&s;e Con&s;ciences were more &s;trictly
obey'd; &s;o the ab&s;olute re&s;training the Liber|ty
of Occa&s;ional Conforming, in all that
&s;hould enjoy any Publick Employment,
tying them up from ever Communicating,
or &s;o much as hearing a Sermon in a <HI>Di&s;|&s;enting
Meeting,</HI> or indeed in any Foreign
Prote&s;tant Church, on Pain of lo&s;ing their
Employments and Livelyhood; this always
carry'd with it &s;uch an Air of Cruelty,
&s;uch an Inva&s;ion of Native-Right, &s;uch an
Oppre&s;&s;ion of Con&s;cience, &s;uch a vi&s;ible In|con&s;i&s;tency
with the <HI REND="blackletterType">Toleration,</HI> and &s;uch
a Degree of <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> that all the mode|rate
Part, even of the Church of <HI>England</HI>
it &s;elf, oppo&s;ed it.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">
How it was fir&s;t introduced and pa&s;s'd the

relating to &s;ome Circum&s;tances
not e&s;&s;ential to the Bill, and which the
Commons would gladly have quitted in
their &s;ub&s;equent Attempts; and yet how the
Commons adhering to their fir&s;t Bill, and
the Lords in&s;i&s;ting on their Amendment,
that Bill was lo&s;t: How the next Se&s;&s;ion,
a &s;econd Bill was brought in, and &s;ent up to
the Lords, but the Temper of Per&s;ecution
having lo&s;t Ground, was thrown out by

how a third Bill was brought into the Hou&s;e

by the Attempt to Tack it to another Bill;
and how that Tacking Project not only
threw out the Bill, but even overthrew the
Party, that had been all along &s;o forward
to promote it: The&s;e are Things &s;o well
known to every Man that has any Con|cern

When after this by the late <HI REND="blackletterType">Court-Revo|lution</HI>
in <HI>England,</HI> a new Turn was given to
all our Civil Affairs, and new Faces ap|pear'd
in the Management; as the Warmth
of the <HI>High Church</HI> Party appear'd in &s;e|veral
Extravagancies &s;o unbounded, as we
had Rea&s;on to apprehend, that they could
be deny'd nothing, and knew they
would &s;tick at nothing to rai&s;e their New
Party and effectually cru&s;h the Old, &s;o it
was expected this old Affair &s;hould be re|vived.</P>
<P>When
we &s;ay <HI>expected,</HI> 'tis needful to add
that it was expected by every Party: The
<HI>High Party</HI> expected it; they &s;aid one to
another, That now was the happy Moment,
when it was in their Power entirely, not to
e&s;tabli&s;h the Church only, but &s;o effectually
to cru&s;h the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> as to
render it impo&s;&s;ible for them ever to ri&s;e
again, at lea&s;t &s;o as to make them&s;elves
formidable to the Church.</P>
<P>We might add here what that Party pro|mi&s;ed
them&s;elves from the Re&s;toration of
their Friends, the Elections having gone
generally in their favour; how they reduc'd
the <HI REND="blackletterType">Toleration</HI> to &s;uch a Pitch, that they
would no more have it allow'd to be a <HI REND="blackletterType">To|leration,</HI>
but an Exemption from the Pe|nalty
of certain Laws; how the Academies
<PB N="21" REF="20">
and Schools of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> were threaten|ed,
and Pro&s;ecutions again&s;t &s;ome of them
actually begun; and how in all Places, they
began to threaten the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> with &s;hut|ting
up their Meeting-Hou&s;es, and in many
Places, rabbl'd, pull'd down, and burnt
their Meeting-Hou&s;es; but this may be re|ferr'd
to a more proper Place; this may, we
hope, &s;ufficiently prove, That the Friends
of that Party made no que&s;tion, but that an
<HI REND="blackletterType">Occa&s;ional Bill</HI> &s;hould be immediately
brought in.</P>
<P>The <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> te&s;tify'd early their ju&s;t
Apprehen&s;ions, when in the Hurry of this
Change at Court, and the coming in of a
New Party like a Flood; the In&s;ults in
their Per&s;ons, the Injuries in their Hou&s;es
and Meetings, the Abu&s;ive Railing Pam|phlets,
and the Tumultuous carrying of all
kinds of Elections, again&s;t common Rules
of Mode&s;ty and Decency, as well as Right,
made it Rational to them to think, that no|thing
could be &s;o &s;evere, but what they had
Rea&s;on to expect; and therefore that an
<HI REND="blackletterType">Occa&s;ional Bill</HI> &s;hould be Introduc'd in|to
the next Parliament, to the Ruin of their
Liberty, was one of the lea&s;t Things which
they thought it was Rea&s;onable to fear.</P>
<P>Even tho&s;e Gentlemen, who tho' willing
for other Rea&s;ons, to join in the Changes
at Court, were yet of more Moderate Prin|ciples,
<PB N="22" REF="21">
that were willing to have the late
Mini&s;try depos'd, and admitted the New
Mini&s;try, as a Means to &s;uch other Ends as
they had in View, whether re&s;pecting this
or that View, yet unconcern'd with any
Religious Pro&s;pects; The&s;e, tho' they did
not approve of the Occa&s;ional Bill, as what
they imagin'd needle&s;s to the Church, and
tending to encrea&s;e the &V;nea&s;ine&s;&s;es of the
People, which they having &s;ettled the New
Management of Civil Affairs, de&s;ir'd to
bring to &s;ome &s;ettled Condition; yet it is
plain, expected the Occa&s;ional Bill to be
pu&s;h'd at the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, and as they ex|pected
it, &s;o they apply'd them&s;elves to pre|vent
it, and, as by the Con&s;equence appear'd,
did prevent it.</P>
<P>It will be needle&s;s to bring the Com|plaints
of the Hot Men again&s;t the&s;e la&s;t; for
their fatal Moderation, as they call it, is an
Evidence, that the&s;e Men of Moderation
did effectually &s;top the Current of that Zeal,
or Heat, call it what you plea&s;e, which
would have put forward &s;uch a Bill: 'Tis
enough, that the Hou&s;e of Commons go|verning
them&s;elves by Moderate Councils,
contrary to all the Expectations, Hopes, or
Fears, as above, offer'd nothing to the Pre|judice
of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> abridg'd none of
their Liberties, nor encourag'd any of the
Heats without Doors, which would have
<PB N="23" REF="22">
pu&s;h'd at the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters;</HI> and the Se&s;&s;ion
pa&s;s'd over, with a Calmne&s;s, as exceeding|ly
Mortifying to the Enemies of Peace, as
perhaps Surprizing to tho&s;e who had been
under Apprehen&s;ions of other U&s;age, as a|bove.</P>
<P>By
this happy Conduct, the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> be|gan
to take Courage, Re-builded their De|moli&s;h'd
Meeting-Hou&s;es, and promis'd to
them&s;elves, that as Her Maje&s;ty had pa&s;s'd
Her Royal Word, to pre&s;erve <HI REND="blackletterType">Inviolable</HI>
their Privileges and Religious Liberty, they
&s;hould enjoy the &s;ame, notwith&s;tanding the

by what ever Influence, and with what e|ver

<P>We are now come to that unhappy

<P>But above all, it &s;eems A&s;toni&s;hing to

<P>Poor

Introduction of it into the . . . .</P>
<P>It might be expected here, that &s;ome|what
&s;hould be &s;aid to the Matter, of the
pre&s;ent Bill depending: But there may be
more time for that, and a Time more pro|per.</P>
<P>It
may &s;uffice at pre&s;ent, to &s;peak a
little to the General De&s;ign of a <HI>Bill,</HI> or
<HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> again&s;t <HI>The Occa&s;ional
Conformity of Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> whether it re&s;pects
this Bill or no, and a little of that <HI>Occa&s;i|onal
Conformity</HI> it &s;elf, as they relate to
what has been formerly Tran&s;acted in
both Hou&s;es of Parliament upon that
Head.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32">
We have not the lea&s;t View in this to
plead for the Occa&s;ional Conformity of the
Di&s;&s;enters, as it relates to a meer Qualifi|cation,
a Practice which it is manife&s;t few
of the Di&s;&s;enters defend, which they are
very much come off from, and which has
done much more Prejudice to the Di&s;&s;enters
them&s;elves, than to the Church. But it &s;eems
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in common Ju&s;tice, to
di&s;tingui&s;h here between a voluntary ill Pra|ctice
of a few, and a Law to dive&s;t the Sub|ject
either of his Civil or Religious Right.</P>
<P>We find many People, who by their con|&s;tant
Practice, tho' di&s;&s;enting in Wor&s;hip,
and in many things relating to Di&s;cipline,
Church-Government and Ceremony, have
yet held it as a Point of Con&s;cience, to main|tain
a Communion of Charity with the
Church; others, tho' they do not choo&s;e to
Communicate with the Church, yet in &s;uch
Ca&s;es where the Law requires it, think them|&s;elves
bound in Con&s;cience, <HI>as they are to &s;hew
Obedience to the Laws,</HI> to comply with that
Occa&s;ionally, which &s;tatedly, they cannot do;
the&s;e we call <HI>Con&s;cientious Conformers.</HI></P>
<P>If the&s;e things are meerly Matter of Prin|ciple,
then oppre&s;&s;ing the&s;e Men mu&s;t be
the highe&s;t of <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> which <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI>
was cen&s;ur'd in the Preamble to the fir&s;t Oc|ca&s;ional
Bill, to be <HI>contrary to the Principle
of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and the Doctrine</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="33">
<HI>of the Church of</HI> England: And it is to be
noted here, as well worth our Reflection,
that both the fir&s;t and &s;econd <HI>Occa&s;ional Bills</HI>
were rejected, becau&s;e they were look'd upon
to be a Degree of <HI>Per&s;ecution.</HI></P>
<P>We cannot but think 'tis always rea&s;ona|ble
to di&s;tingui&s;h, between preventing an
evil Practice, and taking away a Civil Right,
and that this is the Ca&s;e here, no Body will
di&s;pute.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters have injury enough, in
that they are by the Letter of the Law, <HI>con|trary
to the Intent and Meaning of the whole
Legi&s;lature at the time of its making,</HI> exclu|ded
from the common Privileges in Society
with their Fellow-Subjects, <HI>viz.</HI> of &s;erving
the Publick, and receiving the Reward of
their Prince, for the Expre&s;&s;ions of their
Zeal and Loyalty in the publick Service; ex|cept
upon the unhappy Condition of doing
that (which as Di&s;&s;enters) they may be not
&s;uppo&s;ed capable to do.</P>
<P>But to lay &s;o &s;evere an Injunction, That
if ever they touch any publick Employ, they
&s;hall never go to hear a Sermon again, or to
communicate again in a Meeting-Hou&s;e.
This is Per&s;ecution with a witne&s;s, to com|pel
to do any thing, which is again&s;t our
Con&s;cience to do, otherwi&s;e, tho' lawful in
it&s;elf, <HI>is Per&s;ecution;</HI> to re&s;train from doing
what is in it &s;elf lawful, and we may think
<PB N="35" REF="34">
to be Duty to do, <HI>is Per&s;ecution;</HI> and all the
Puni&s;hment inflicted in the&s;e Ca&s;es, <HI>is Per|&s;ecution</HI>
in the Ab&s;tract.</P>
<P>It has been &s;o often argu'd, that this is
no Service to the Church, or to the High
Party, that this Argument &s;eems perfectly
u&s;ele&s;s to be repeated; but we cannot but
take notice, that all the Acts hitherto pro|pos'd,
have not &s;eem'd to have an Eye to the
Church, but to the Civil Preferments; not
to bring the Di&s;&s;enters over to the Church,
but to keep them out of the Offices of Profit.
There lies the true Aim in all this matter;
and this has been &s;o vi&s;ible in all the former
Practice, that it needs little Explanation.</P>
<P>Had the De&s;ign been purely the bringing
the Di&s;&s;enters over to the Church, they would
let it alone where it is, &s;ince nothing is more
certain than this, that the Occa&s;ional Con|formity
of Di&s;&s;enters has done more towards
bringing all their Po&s;terity into the Church,
than all the Coecive Laws, Penal Statutes,
or other Violence in the World could ever
do; and it is mo&s;t remarkable, that general|ly
&s;peaking, where-ever the Parents have
been Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;ts, the Children
have been total Conformi&s;t. So that this
Liberty taken by the Di&s;&s;enters, has been
the Ruin of their Strength, the breaking of
the principal Families of their Party, and the
<PB N="36" REF="35">
indifferency of one Age has terminated the
di&s;&s;enting of the next.</P>
<P>This the High Church Men are not igno|rant
of, and it is mention'd for this Rea&s;on,
<HI>viz.</HI> To prove, that were the true Intere&s;t
of the Church regarded in this Ca&s;e, or at
lea&s;t were that true Intere&s;t the End and De|&s;ign
in the&s;e things, they would entirely let
the Di&s;&s;enters alone. But the De&s;ign in the&s;e
things is &s;o far from that, is &s;o remote from
a Religious View, that it all centers in ma|king
Parties, keeping Po&s;ts of Profit and Ad|vantage,
and if po&s;&s;ible, keeping the Di&s;&s;en|ters
out of them; and which is yet wor&s;e,
the Aim is at a dividing the Intere&s;t of the
Whiggs, which being link'd to that of the
Di&s;&s;enters, has been too formidable for them
to deal with; but if the Low Church Men
can be brought to give up the Di&s;&s;enters&mdash;What
then! Why they &s;hall have the Ho|nour&mdash;of
what? Of being devour'd la&s;t,
and that is all they can promi&s;e them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And will the Low Church Men give up
the Di&s;&s;enters? Will they make a Sacrifice
of the Con&s;ciences of their Brethren, to gain
a &s;mall Addition to their Party Intere&s;t?
What can be &s;aid to them? We crave leave
to remind them of two or three things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. How long do ye think the New Inte|re&s;t
you are making will la&s;t, upon &s;o
<PB N="37" REF="36">
ill a Foundation built? How far can you
go along with the New Converts you are
bringing over, either they mu&s;t turn
Whigs, or you mu&s;t turn High Flyers?
The fir&s;t can never be but by Project,
and purpo&s;e to trick and deceive you;
and the la&s;t can never be but by unac|countable
and mo&s;t judicial Blindne&s;s;
and if the&s;e cannot be, then you cannot
go far together.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. When they and you part, and they go
back to their own Party, you having in
the highe&s;t manner provok'd the Di&s;&s;en|ters,
are you able to &s;tand the Ground
again&s;t Popery and High Flying mad
Men by your &s;elves?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Remember the time when you were
la&s;t try'd, and con&s;ider that two things
will &s;uit your pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. (1.) That
when you were try'd with Popery and
Slavery, the one from a Popi&s;h Prince,
the other from <HI>French</HI> Maxims of Go|vernment,
what was your Ca&s;e? Were
you able to &s;tand your Ground alone?
were you not &s;en&s;ible of the impo&s;&s;ibility
of it? And (2.) when you were &s;en&s;ible
of the contrary, and made &s;olemn In|vitations
to the Di&s;&s;enters to &s;tand by
you, and join with you, did the Di&s;|&s;enters
abandon you? Did they make
their Court to King <HI>James</HI> at your Ex|pence,
<PB N="38" REF="37">
as it is evident they might have
done, and were courted by the King to
do? In &s;hort, did they &s;erve you then,
as they are &s;erved by you? No; they
re&s;i&s;ted all the Care&s;&s;es of Popery and
and Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience, Tories, and
cho&s;e Affliction and Hazard with that
very Church of <HI>England,</HI> that now are for
denying them the lea&s;t publick Advan|tage,
from that Government they have
&s;pent their Blood and their Money to
&s;upport?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Are the&s;e the Men you will now Sacrifice
to the private Views you have of a Party-Strength?
Are the&s;e the Returns to the
Di&s;&s;enters, for the putting them&s;elves into
your Hands? Is this the Temper promi&s;ed
them at the Revolution? Is this the Ju&s;tice
to their adhering &s;o vehemently to the per|&s;onal
Intere&s;t, in the late Changes of tho&s;e
that are now making a Market of them?
Hone&s;t <HI>Coleman!</HI> Thou ha&s;t lo&s;t the mo&s;t
effectual and undi&s;puted Axiom of Political
Philo&s;ophy that ever was deliver'd at the

<ITEM>1. The Bill now depending in Parliament,
tho' it may re&s;train the Occa&s;ional Con|formity
of Di&s;&s;enters, as to Places, yet
it gives you more than the Equivalent
in many Things; it confirms the To|leration,
it re&s;tores the Act of Exem|ption
to the Name of the Toleration,
which it had lo&s;t; it checks the Jaco|bites
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and it is not extended
<PB N="40" REF="39">
in many Things, which were included
in the former Act.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It was brought in from a Pro&s;pect of
meer Kindne&s;s to the Di&s;&s;enters, to pre|vent
the De&s;ign of another Party, who
had projected one tenfold wor&s;e, and
which had been perfectly ruinous to the
Di&s;&s;enters Intere&s;t, and had in effect
turn'd the Toleration out of Doors.
And both the&s;e evidence that the Di&s;|&s;enters
are not given up, or betray'd, or
&s;acrific'd, as above.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>We an&s;wer briefly to this, that, <HI>as before,</HI>
We are not debating what Favour the Two
Hou&s;es of Parliament may grant in the Bill
now depending. It is not for us to &s;ay here
we are &s;peaking <HI>of</HI> or <HI>to</HI> that Bill, or to the
Hou&s;es of Parliament; but we are &s;peaking
to tho&s;e People, whom we call <HI>Whigs without
Doors,</HI> who are concern'd in, or agree to
bringing any Bill in, or putting forward any
Law, to re&s;train the Con&s;ciences of Innocent
Men, and take from them at the &s;evere Pe|nalty
of the lo&s;s of their Employments, the
Liberty of &s;erving God, according to their
Con&s;ciences: If the Parliament have &s;weet|ned
this bitter Potion with any Negatives;
with any Favours, We are for being thankful
for all Favours, but We are not to think our
&s;elves oblig'd at all to any of tho&s;e People,
<PB N="41" REF="40">
<HI>if any &s;uch are,</HI> who having it in their Power
to prevent it, have put us into the Condition
to &s;eek or be glad of &s;uch Favours.</P>
<P>And let tho&s;e Favours be what they will,
if the Clau&s;e excluding all tho&s;e from the
Natural Privilege of <HI>Loyal Subjects,</HI> and from
the Favours of their Sovereign, who cannot,
<HI>how Con&s;ciencious &s;oever their Scruples are,</HI> Con|form
to the <HI>Church:</HI> We may without Offence
&s;ay, we &s;hould not be at all the le&s;s thank|ful
to be without the &s;aid Favours, having
but at the &s;ame time the Liberty to be
without the Grievance.</P>
<P>As to what is called <HI>Confirming our To|leration,</HI>
if we think it &s;ufficiently Confirm'd
before, and in a mo&s;t Sacred Manner E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd,
be&s;ides the Act of Parliament, in
the Sanction of Her Maje&s;ty's Solemn Pro|mi&s;e
from the Throne, of pre&s;erving it
<HI REND="blackletterType">Inviolable:</HI> We hope it will not be ill
taken, if we &s;ay, We do not &s;ee how it can
be better Confirm'd, tho' every Se&s;&s;ion of

Favour: Nor is our Confidence le&s;s in Her

are or can be pa&s;s'd, &s;ince one Parliament
may Repeal what ever Acts another has
made, <HI>and even their own too:</HI> But Her Ma|je&s;ty's
Veracity is a Royal Security which
we have &s;o much Dependance upon, as
<PB N="42" REF="41">
we cannot prevail upon our &s;elves to &s;ay,
We de&s;ire any further Confirmation of it.</P>
<P>That the Parliament in their printed
Votes have thrown Dirt in the Face of
that condemn'd Impo&s;tor <HI>S . . . . . l,</HI> and
re&s;tor'd the Act for the Liberty of <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters,</HI>
to the true Title and Denomination
of it, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI REND="blackletterType">Toleration, vide</HI> the <HI>Votes,
Die Lunae Decemb.</HI> 18. 1711. It is a &s;atisfy|ing
Piece of Ju&s;tice done that Honourable
Hou&s;e, and what we are bound to acknow|ledge,
is like the Righteous Proceedings of
&s;o Augu&s;t an A&s;&s;embly, and we &s;hould
have been larger in owning the Favour,
did it not come accompany'd with &s;ome|thing
in the Cover of it, which we can by
no means, without the utmo&s;t Hypocri&s;y
be thankful for, <HI>viz. An Act to re&s;train
the Con&s;ciences of Men, in the Affair of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
Offices, without renouncing the wor&s;hip|ping
God in their own way, and according to the
Dictates of their Con&s;ciences.</HI> For this we
can no more be thankful, than to a Judge
who pronounces Sentence of Death again&s;t

of.</P>
<P>That we had as <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> a Legal <HI>Tole|ration</HI>
before, by Act of Parliament, is cer|tain,
That the Act Intitled, <HI>An Act to Ex|empt
Her Maje&s;ty's Prote&s;tant Subjects,</HI> &amp;c.
is a <HI>Toleration,</HI> is out of all que&s;tion true,
<PB N="43" REF="42">
and to prove it, The Title to this Act now

in who&s;e Name, and by who&s;e very Mouths
<HI>S . . . . . . l</HI> is thus pronounc'd an Impo&s;tor
and a Deceiver.</P>
<P>We might Addre&s;s our &s;elves now to
&s;peak to the Act it &s;elf, and examine Two
Things in it, and which &s;hall be done with
Brevity and Mode&s;ty.</P>

<ITEM>1. Will this Act an&s;wer the End which
is pretended in the Title, <HI>viz. To &s;ecure
the Church of England?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Will it an&s;wer the particular View of
tho&s;e who acquie&s;ce in it, in hopes of
obtaining by it their Party-Ends, a|gain&s;t
the Mea&s;ures taken for a Peace?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Will this Act an&s;wer the Two other
Ends, confirm the <HI>Toleration,</HI> and pre|&s;erve
the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion?</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. Will it an&s;wer the End which is pre|tended
in the Title, <HI>viz.</HI> To <HI>&s;ecure the Church
of England;</HI> To this I give the Opinion of
all tho&s;e Gentlemen, who&s;e Speeches are up|on
Record, again&s;t the fir&s;t and &s;econd
<HI REND="blackletterType">Occa&s;ional-Bill,</HI> where it &s;eems manife&s;t,
at lea&s;t, That it was all their Opinion, that
this Law would bring no real Addition to
the <HI>Church,</HI> only &s;erve to keep the Body of
<PB N="44" REF="43">
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> more united: And if we might
add in this Ca&s;e, that <HI>&V;nion</HI> may in time
be found the only Ca&s;e, in which the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters</HI>
can be formidable to the <HI>Church:</HI> The
divided Condition of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> their
vain Tru&s;ts in the <HI>Great Men</HI> who they
thought were their <HI>Protectors,</HI> their frequent
Acce&s;s to Favours and Fortunes; the&s;e have
all along been the Foundation of their Di&s;|a&s;ters;
their Dependance upon <HI>Great Men</HI>
elevated them, made them &s;ecure, divided
them, made them de&s;pi&s;e Caution and Ene|mies,
and made them &s;elf-intere&s;ted, narrow,
and re&s;erv'd; <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> it bury'd what they
call a Publick Spirit among them; this le&s;|&s;en'd
them in their Real Strength to that
Degree, that in&s;tead of making them For|midable,
it made them De&s;picable; &s;o that
indeed the Liberty and Occa&s;ional Confor|mity
of Di&s;&s;enters, has been their Ruin, has
been the Weakning their Strength, Le&s;&s;en|ing
their Numbers, and De&s;troying their
Intere&s;t; and in all the&s;e have been, <HI>if the
Pro&s;perity of the Di&s;&s;enters is the Churches
Danger,</HI> a Safety to the Church. Now
will this Re&s;traint an&s;wer the Churches
End, as it is propos'd? It is impo&s;&s;ible;
neither is it Calculated for that End, &s;ince
as is before Noted, the De&s;ign is not to
bring the Di&s;&s;enters over to the Church,
but to keep them out of Places: But if
<PB N="45" REF="44">
alarm'd by this Treatment, the Di&s;&s;enters
&s;hould more firmly Unite, act in Concert,
recover the Reputation of their Integrity
and Sincerity, as if they are wi&s;e they may,
they will add weight to their Intere&s;t, and
the End of their mighty Struggle will be
quite Defeated.</P>
<P N="2">2. Will it an&s;wer the End of tho&s;e, who
by it pu&s;h at breaking the Mea&s;ures of the
Court, as to Peace or War?</P>
<P><HI>Not in the lea&s;t.</HI> The Intere&s;t they had
this way is entirely divided by it; Mutual
Confidence is De&s;troy'd, <HI>Irretrievably De|&s;troy'd,</HI>
and can never be Re&s;tor'd. When
Men Tru&s;t and Confide in one another, and
then Decieve one another, they <HI>&s;eldom,</HI> but
in Parties and Sets of Men <HI>Never</HI> Tru&s;t a|gain;
they may join Out-&s;ides, tho' that
will be Difficult, but In-&s;ides Never: Now
if the Concert is broken, which <HI>when whole</HI>
could not with&s;tand the Mea&s;ures above,
how &s;hould they do it when Divided?
No Strength encrea&s;es by being &s;eparated;
<HI>Vis Unita Fortior,</HI> is an Old and True Max|im,
to &s;ay <HI>Vis &s;eparata Fortior,</HI> would be a
gro&s;s Ab&s;urdity; Can any one be &s;o weak
to think that the Intere&s;t of the Whigs and
Di&s;&s;enters, which is mi&s;erably Torn and
Di&s;membred by this My&s;tery of Politicks,
can be able to do that now which they could
not do before? Where are the Legions
<PB N="46" REF="45">
added to their Strength by this New Step?
Where is the Equivalent they Recieve?
<HI>Ridiculus Mus!</HI> A poor empty unaccom|pany'd
<HI>Hero,</HI> Who&s;e Intere&s;t has not been
able to Draw his own Brethren, the Sons of
his Mother, into his Mea&s;ures. Nay, who&s;e
Mea&s;ures Unconcerted and Undetermin'd,
have hardly amounted to a Clear Propo&s;al&mdash;Where
are the Preliminaries of this mighty
Treaty? Truly the Whigs have done as
the King of <HI>France</HI> was to do, fir&s;t evacuate
the Towns, and then let the Confederates
make their Demands, &s;o they have fir&s;t eva|cuated
their Friends, &s;urrendred the Faith
they had Pledg'd to the Di&s;&s;enters, and now
the Tories may make their Demands, and if
it be to give up the Toleration next, we do
not &s;ee how the&s;e can deny them; &s;o that
in &s;hort, the End is as Uncertain as it was
before.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Will this Act Confirm the Toleration?</HI>
Becau&s;e the Hou&s;e &s;ays <HI>it &s;hall,</HI> we will not
&s;ay <HI>it &s;hall not;</HI> but God forbid we &s;hould
&s;ay <HI>it will,</HI> while we &s;ee not the lea&s;t room
for any thing of that Kind: This Act and
a Hundred more of this Nature, being all
attended with this Circum&s;tance, That they
may be Repeal'd by the Breath of the Hou&s;e,
who gives them Life. <HI>As to the Succe&s;&s;ion
being Secured,</HI> by excluding a few <HI>Jacobites</HI>
out of the <HI>Faculty</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where they
<PB N="47" REF="46">
are capable of doing little Mi&s;chief, unle&s;s
they were likewi&s;e excluded out of Com|mi&s;&s;ions
of the Peace in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where
their Power is capable of doing things Fatal
to the Succe&s;&s;ion, as may be proved by innu|merable
In&s;tances, We cannot have &s;o much
value for that Clau&s;e as others have. As to
<HI>Confirming the Toleration,</HI> We will not &s;ay
that this Act is a direct Breach of the <HI>Tole|ration,</HI>
and a mo&s;t Open Inva&s;ion of the Li|berties
Granted to the Di&s;&s;enters by the To|leration;
But we mu&s;t profe&s;s our &s;elves
utterly Ignorant of any Di&s;covery to our pre|&s;ent
Under&s;tanding, as to any Clau&s;e, Mat|ter,
or Thing in it, whereby the &s;aid To|leration
is at all Confirm'd as above&s;aid;
which Ignorance, we hope, may be Humbly
acknowledg'd, without Offence.</P>
<P>We conclude this with One Only View,
being the la&s;t Re&s;ort the Di&s;&s;enters have, and
the Alone Help, which Humane Power can
offer to interpo&s;e in this Affair, and <HI>This is
in Her Maje&s;ties Royal Goodne&s;s and Com|pa&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
