Preach'd <HI>November</HI> the 4th, 1709.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 Chap. 2 Book of Samuel, 24.</BIBL>
<Q>Ye Daughters of I&s;rael, weep over Saul, who cloathed
you in Scarlet, with other Delights; who put on
ornaments of Gold upon your Apparrel.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NOW, Gentlemen, you will pardon me a
Digre&s;&s;ion, when I &s;hall remind you that
this is the 4th Day of <HI>November,</HI> the initial Day
of <HI>Euroupe</HI>'s Liberty, the great Dawning of this
Age's Glory; the Day that God has hallow'd or
&s;et apart to be prai&s;ed in, for that unvalued Ble&s;|&s;ing
of King <HI>William</HI>'s Life. On this Day it be|gan.
The Thankfulne&s;s of hone&s;t Men for the in|e&s;timable
Gift, &s;hall never fail to be revived this
Day, while they have Hearts to own it, or <HI>Britain</HI>
has hone&s;t Men left to know the Hand that &s;aved
them, or to remember who&s;e glorius In&s;trument
he was, to a&s;&s;ault Tyranny, and the mo&s;t trium|phant
Enemies of God's Church, and his People's
Liberty.</P>
<P>May this Day be Sacred to his Memory, <HI>and it</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<HI>will be &s;o,</HI> while there are any &s;uch thing as hone&s;t
Men in this Part of the World&mdash; The Reflection
upon the lea&s;t temporal Mercy ye enjoy, <HI>ay and
&s;ome &s;piritual ones too,</HI> mu&s;t bring back your Me|mory
to <HI>this Day,</HI> and by this Day to the Per&s;on
by who&s;e Name 'tis call'd I know 'tis hard, as a
Reverend Prelate of this Church once took notice,
<HI>for Engli&s;h Men to remember Twenty long Years be|hind
them, e&s;pecially &s;o di&s;pi&s;ed a thing as a Bene|fector</HI>
But an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man cannot look round him
a Day in his Life, but he is as nece&s;&s;arily brought
to a Remembrance of King <HI>William.</HI> I had almo&s;t
&s;aid, as he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">of a Governing Providence in the
World. Nor is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> any thing prophane to joyn them;
For by Him, as In&s;trument, has Providence brought
to pa&s;s for us all the Wonders of the la&s;t Age&mdash;An
Age big with mighty Events, &s;well'd with the glo|rious
Revolutions of Kingdoms, and the mighty
Downfall of Hell's mon&s;trous Schemes, laid deep,
and politickly derected at the Intere&s;t and King|dom
of Chri&s;t Je&s;us in the World.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> was the Thunderbolt that &s;plit all the
mighty Work, that blow up the Foundation of the
Devil's Kingdom in <HI>Europe</HI>; that &s;hook the va&s;t
Fabrick, and left it &s;o weak, that even a Wo|man
is thought on, Can an Engli&s;h Man go to Bed,
or ri&s;e up, without ble&s;&s;ing the very Name of
King <HI>William</HI>? His Perils have been our Safety,
his Labours our Ea&s;e, his Cares our Comfort, his
continued Hara&s;&s;ing and Fatigue, our continued
Calm and Tranquility.</P>
<P>When you &s;it down to eat why have you not
Soldiers quarter'd in your Hou&s;es to command
your Servants and in&s;ult your Tables? 'Tis becau&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<HI>King William</HI> &s;ubjected the Military to the Civil
Authority, and made the Sword of Ju&s;tice triumph
over the Sword of War, When you lye down at
Night why do you not bolt and bar your Chamber,
to defend the Cha&s;tity of your Wives and Daugh|ters
from the ungovern'd Lu&s;t of raging Mercen|aries?
'Tis becau&s;e <HI>King William</HI> re&s;tored the Sove|reignty
and Dominion of the Laws, and made the
Red-Coat World Servants to tho&s;e that paid them.
When you receive your Rents, why are not arbitary
Defalcations made upon your Tennants, arbitary
Impo&s;ts laid upon your Commerce, and oppre&s;&s;ive
Taxes levied upon your E&s;tates, to &s;upport the
Tyranny that demands them, and your Bondage
made &s;trong at your Expence? 'Tis becau&s;e <HI>King
William</HI> re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd the e&s;&s;ential Security of your
Properties, and put you into that happy Condition
which few Nations enjoy, of calling your Souls
your own. How came you by a Parliament to bal|lence
between the Governed and the Governing,
but upon King <HI>William</HI>'s exalting Liberty upon the
ruin of the Oppre&s;&s;ion? How came you to have
Power to abu&s;e your Deliverer, but by the very
Deliverance he wrought for you? He gave you that
Liberty you afterwards took to in&s;ult him, and &s;up|ported
you in tho&s;e very Priviledges you ungrate|fully
bullied him with. You could not with all
your bruti&s;h skill provoke him to be a Tyrant,
He abhorr'd Oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;corn'd to practi&s;e it,
and he that had Fire enough to a&s;&s;ault all your
Oppre&s;&s;ors, and a Hand &s;trong enough to wre&s;tle
with an e&s;tabli&s;h'd and confirm'd Tyrant, had yet
Meekne&s;s enough to let you oppre&s;s him, becau&s;e
he would not oppre&s;s you, and &s;aw you ungrateful
<PB N="5" REF="5">
enough to oppo&s;e not your Benefactor only, but
your own Felicity for his &s;ake.</P>
<P>Yet to the la&s;t he fought for you again&s;t foreign
Tyranny, and kept his Foot upon the Neck of
your &s;ecret U&s;urpers; He trod upon them. And
tho&s;e than courted him at Home to re&s;ent your In|gratitude,
received his con&s;tant Frown; This was
the Man that liv'd for you, and yet died by you,
and hearken to it with Regret, and reproach your
&s;elves with it whil&s;t you live, He died murther'd
by your Unkindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Heaven, that honour'd him here, and receiv'd
him from hence, has &s;hown &s;ome dreadful In&s;tances
of his Abhorrence of the Manner he was treated
here, and has re&s;ented the particular In&s;ults done
to his Name, as if done to him&s;elf; And I wi&s;h
I could not &s;ay, Heaven &s;eems to puni&s;h us Nati|onally
for our National U&s;age of this Prince, who
was his eminent In&s;trument to us for Good.</P>
<P>How are we, notwith&s;tanding our Victories, yet
embarra&s;s'd in that cruel and bloody War, which
we reproach'd him for not ending &s;ooner? We
have not yet arriv'd to that Partition-Treaty, that
we threw in his Face, And if greater Conditions
have been &s;eemingly offer'd us, they have been but
&s;eemingly &s;o, without any Security for their being
made effectual. We have had Rea&s;on now to &s;ee
our Reproaches of King <HI>William</HI> unju&s;t, who we
redicul'd for not beating the <HI>French,</HI> while he has
rather harden'd him&s;elf this Year, than &s;ubmitted,
after he has been five Times overthrown.</P>
<P>Let us look back to King <HI>William</HI>'s Part in this War,
and imagine <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. in the &s;tate he was in when
that War began. Not all the Princes and States of <HI>Eu|rope</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
united, would have begun a War again&s;t him. His
Armies numerous in Men, and all tho&s;e Men veterans
in War, and flu&s;h'd with Conque&s;t; his Trea&s;ures in a
Kind infinite, his Generals experienc'd and enterpri|zing;
him&s;elf 20 years younger and vigorous. I tell
ye none of ye all would have ventur'd to begin the
War, nor would you have been in your Wits, if you
had. It was a Work only fit for a <HI>William,</HI> a King that
could conquer by being overthrown, that could &s;trug|gle
with Impo&s;&s;ibilities, and could penetrate into the
remote&s;t Events.</P>
<P>Let any Man look into the Temper of our Nation at
this time, and they will find we are not now fit for a
Di&s;a&s;ter, as we were then; we have fought the <HI>French,</HI>
and beaten them, thank God for it; for Woe to us if we
had lo&s;t the Day! How would our Credit have been
run down, our Bank being pu&s;h'd at, our General in|&s;ulted,
our Mini&s;try abus'd, as if really Men were now
in God's &s;tead.</P>
<P>And that the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> could not only fight
for Victory, but command it, But King <HI>William</HI> &s;aw
Victory even in the want of Succe&s;s; He lo&s;t the Bat|tles,
and won the Day, and in this I am not too for|ward,
if I &s;ay, he fought as never Man fought and con|quer'd&punc;
He fought with a fierce victorious Enemy abroad,
with cruel and intolerable Deficiences at Home, and
yet he fought! Any body but King <HI>William</HI> would have
yielded to in&s;uperable Difficulties, but he fought on,
and reduc'd the King of <HI>France</HI> at la&s;t, to &s;eek Peace,
acknowledge him King, and affront the Refugee that
he fought to re&s;tore.</P>
<P>Thus he broke the fir&s;t Power of the invincible
<HI>French</HI> Empire; He broke their old Veterans, and ex|hau&s;ted
their immen&s;e Trea&s;ures; He took the haugh|ty
<HI>Lewis</HI> by the Throat in the flower of his Strength,
and &s;et his Foot again&s;t him, when he was another kind
of <HI>Ltwis</HI> than he is now. And tho' I would not le&s;&s;en
the Glory of the pre&s;ent Conquerors in the Field, yet as
<PB N="7" REF="7">
a Mine under a great Rock, tho' it cannot entirely
blow it away, yet &s;hakes it, and di&s;locates it, &s;o as to
make it ea&s;ier for Workmen to remove; So King <HI>Wil|liam</HI>
&s;hook the Foundations of <HI>French</HI> Power in &s;uch a
manner, as has made it much ea&s;ier for others to cru&s;h
it entirely, than it would otherwi&s;e have been.</P>
<P>At la&s;t Heaven, provok'd at your Treatment of this
Prince, removed him from us, and were it not a Debt
due to his Memory, I &s;hould bury in &s;ilence the barba|rous
Abu&s;es of him after his Decea&s;e; but particularly
the Article of the Hor&s;e. The King was thrown by his
Hor&s;e, or rather his Hor&s;e fell with him, by which his
Maje&s;ty received &s;ome hurt in his Collar-Bone, which
as it was thought ha&s;tned his Death, tho, it is evident
he did not die of that Hurt.</P>
<P>Now let them not only blu&s;h, but tremble at the E|vent,
who have in&s;ulted his Memory, by cannonizing
in their Cups the Hor&s;e that threw down the King,
drinking a Health to the Bea&s;t, le&s;s &s;o by far than the
Bruits that drink it, and rejoycing in the Di&s;a&s;ter. Let
&s;uch no more talk of Calves Head Clubs and Fea&s;ts of
Triumph, tho' vile enough too, in&s;ulting the Dead; but
nothing can match the Infamy of this Practice, odious
both to God and Man. How odious it is to Man, I
think I need not in&s;i&s;t upon; no hone&s;t Man can think
of it without Horror; But how odious to God it is,
you &s;hall all be judge.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, pray remark it, to the Honour of
Divine Vengeance, and to the extraordinary Convicti|on
of all that can open their Eyes to the Methods of the
Almighty, in his examplar Dealings with impious Men;
That of the &s;candalous Wretches, who have thus in&s;ult|ed
the Memory of King <HI>William</HI> in this Nation, by
drinking the Hor&s;e's Health that hurt him. I can give
you Account of at lea&s;t Eleven, that have had their
<PB N="8" REF="8">
Brains da&s;h'd out, or their Necks broke, by falls from
their Hor&s;es; Be&s;ides &s;ome that have been very much
hurt, but have had Time &s;par'd to them for Repentance,
And if ye think it for your In&s;truction, I may hereafter
give you their &s;everal Hi&s;tories. Pray mark the Retali|ation,
I &s;ay it again, All by falls from their Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Can we have have a greater Te&s;timomy of the abhord
Wickedne&s;s of the Thing? Has Heaven, in any Age,
given a greater Witne&s;s to the Honour or Memory of
any Man in the World? You may read plainly, how
dear his Name is to the Divine Power, who concerns
his Ju&s;tice &s;o remarkably to retaliate the Injuries done
it. That the Party, who e&s;pou&s;e the&s;e People, may
read their Crime in their Puni&s;hment. Let the Rem|nant
take heed,</P>
<P>Now Joy and Plea&s;ant Hearts be your Portion, who
commemorate this Day, that Drink a Temporate Gla&s;s
to the Pro&s;perity of all that love <HI>King William</HI>: that ble&s;s
his Memory, and hand on a grateful Sence of his A|ctions
to the Ages to come. And may all that envy and
repine at his Glory, or at the great Things we enjoy
from his Conduct, be di&s;ragarded and di&s;appointed, till
they repent, or do wor&s;e.</P>
