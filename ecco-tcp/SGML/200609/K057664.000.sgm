<HEAD>LETTER to Lord MANSFIELD.</HEAD>
<P>AN author, not more illu&s;trious by birth than by genius, &s;ays, in a letter concerning enthu&s;ia&s;m, <Q REND="inline">"That he had &s;o much need of &s;ome con&s;iderable pre&s;ence or company to rai&s;e his thoughts on any occa&s;ion, that when alone he endeavoured to &s;upply that want by fancying &s;ome great man of &s;uperior genius, who&s;e ima|gin'd pre&s;ence might in&s;pire him with more than what he felt at ordinary hours."</Q> To judge from his Lord&s;hip's writings, this receipt mu&s;t be a good one. It naturally ought to be &s;o; and I imagine that I have more than once felt its enlivening influence. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t edition of this treati&s;e in particular, I can affirm with great truth, that <HI>a great man of &s;uperior genius</HI> was ne|ver out of my view: Will Lord Mansfield reli&s;h this pa&s;&s;age&mdash;How would he have expre&s;&s;ed it&mdash;were my con&s;tant que&s;tions.</P>
<P>BUT though by this means I commanded more vigour of mind, and a keener exertion of thought, than I am capable of <HI>at ordinary hours;</HI> yet I had not courage to mention this to his Lord&s;hip, nor to the world. The &s;ubject I had undertaken was new: I could not hope to e&s;cape errors, perhaps gro&s;s ones; and the ab&s;urdity appear'd glaring, of acknowledging a &s;ort of in&s;piration in a performance that might not exhibit the lea&s;t &s;park of it.</P>
<P>No trouble has been declined upon the pre&s;ent edition; and yet that the work, even in its improved &s;tate, de&s;erves his Lord&s;hip's patronage, I am far from being confident. But however that be, it is no longer in my power to conceal, that the ambition of gain|ing Lord Mansfield's approbation has been my chief &s;upport in this work. Never to reveal that &s;ecret would be to border upon ingrati|tude. Will your Lord&s;hip permit me to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AN author who exerts his talents and indu&s;try upon a new &s;ubject, without hope of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from others, is too apt to flatter him|&s;elf upon his performance; becau&s;e he finds no other work of the kind to humble him by compari&s;on. The attempt to dige&s;t equity into a regular &s;y&s;tem, was not only new, but difficult; and for the&s;e rea&s;ons the author hopes he may be excu&s;ed for not di&s;covering more early &s;everal imperfec|tions in the fir&s;t edition of this book. The&s;e imperfections, when di&s;cover|ed, gave him the greater pain, becau&s;e they concern chiefly the arrangement, in which every mi&s;take mu&s;t be attended with &s;ome degree of ob&s;curi|ty. No labour has been &s;pared to improve the pre&s;ent edition: and yet, after all his endeavours, the author dare not hope that every imperfection is cured: that the arrangement is con&s;iderably improved, is all that with a&s;&s;urance he can take upon him to pronounce.</P>
<P>For an interim gratification of the reader's curio&s;ity before entering upon the work, a few particulars &s;hall here be mentioned. The defects of com|mon law &s;eemed to be &s;o di&s;tinct from its exce&s;&s;es, as to make it proper to handle the&s;e articles &s;eparately; which accordingly is done in the fir&s;t edi|tion. But almo&s;t as &s;oon as the printing was fini&s;hed, it occurred to the author as evidence of an un&s;kilful di&s;tribution, that he had been obliged to handle the &s;ame &s;ubject in different parts of the book, or at lea&s;t to refer from one part to another. This led him to reflect, that the&s;e defects and exce&s;&s;es proceed both of them equally from the very con&s;titution of a court of common law, which is confined within narrow bounds in its power of doing ju&s;tice; and therefore it now appeared evident that they ought to be han|dled promi&s;cuou&s;ly as &s;o many examples of imperfection in common law, which ought to be &s;upplied by a court of equity. So evident is this, that even in the &s;ame ca&s;e we find common law &s;ometimes defective, &s;ometimes exce&s;&s;ive, according to occa&s;ional or accidental circum&s;tances, without any fundamental difference. For example, many claims, good at common law, are reprobated in equity becau&s;e of &s;ome incident wrong that comes not
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
under the cogni&s;ance of common law. A claim of this kind mu&s;t be &s;u&s;tain|ed by a court of common law, which cannot regard the incident wrong; and in &s;uch in&s;tances common law is exce&s;&s;ive, by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the bounds of ju&s;tice. On the other hand, where a claim for reparation is brought by the per&s;on who &s;uffered the wrong, a court of common law can give no re|dre&s;s; and in &s;uch in&s;tances common law is defective. And yet the <HI>ratio decidendi</HI> is preci&s;ely the &s;ame in both ca&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> the limited power of a court of common law.</P>
<P>The tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a deed or covenant is a wrong that ought to be di&s;|tingui&s;hed from a wrong that mi&s;leads a man to make a covenant or to grant a deed. The former only belongs to the chapter <HI>Of Covenants;</HI> the latter, to the chapter <HI>Of the powers of a court of equity to protect individuals from injuries.</HI> For example, a man is fraudulently induced to enter into a contract: the reparation of this wrong, which is antecedent to the contract, cannot ari&s;e from the contract; and for that rea&s;on it is put under the chapter la&s;t mentioned.</P>
<P>Every <HI>quae&s;tio voluntatis</HI> mu&s;t ari&s;e from imperfection or ob&s;curity in the words by which will is declared: therefore all &s;uch que&s;tions ought to come under the fir&s;t &s;ection of the chapter <HI>Of deeds and covenants.</HI></P>
<P>In a &s;trict review of this book for a new edition, the nece&s;&s;ary of refer|ring frequently to other books for the principles of morality, indicated a de|fective performance. To &s;upply that defect, and to make the work com|plete in it&s;elf, there is added to this edition a preliminary di&s;cour&s;e, of which the purpo&s;e is, to open up briefly and di&s;tinctly the fountains of ju&s;tice and equity, from whence are derived all the equitable rules employ'd in this work; avoiding carefully to tea&s;e the reader with controver&s;y, or any critici&s;ms upon former writers. The author flatters him&s;elf that this part of the work will give &s;atisfaction; and &s;uppo&s;ing it to be well executed, it cannot fail of being both plea&s;ant and u&s;eful.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE; BEING, An inve&s;tigation of the Moral Laws of Society.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;cience of morality hath for its &s;ubject, human actions, with their effects; and its end or purpo&s;e is, to regulate the&s;e actions.</P>
<P>To act by in&s;tinct &s;ignifies, to act by blind impul&s;e, without ha|ving any end in view. The brute creatures act generally by in&s;tinct: the in&s;tinct of hunger prompts them to eat, and of cold to take &s;helter, without con&s;idering what the&s;e actions may produce. The &s;ame mu&s;t be the condition of infants: for infants are not capable of any con&s;ideration: they apply to the nipple, without fore&s;eeing that this action will relieve them from hunger; and they cry when pained, without having any view of procuring relief. But as &s;oon as our ripened faculties unfold to us the connection between our ac|tions and their effects, then it is that we begin to act with an inten|tion to produce certain effects; and our actions, in that ca&s;e, are means employ'd to bring about the effects intended.</P>
<P><HI>Intention</HI> and <HI>will,</HI> though generally reckoned &s;ynonymous terms, &s;ignify different operations of the mind: will is relative to the exter|nal action; for we never act without a will to act: intention is rela|tive to the effect; for we act in order to bring about the effect in|tended. It is my intention, for example, to relieve a certain per&s;on from di&s;tre&s;s by giving money: as &s;oon as I &s;ee that per&s;on, it is my will to deliver the money: the external act of delivery follows: and the per&s;on is relieved; which is the effect intended.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="11">
Some effects proceed nece&s;&s;arily from the action. A wound is an effect nece&s;&s;arily connected with the action of &s;tabbing a man with a &s;harp weapon: death is the nece&s;&s;ary effect of throwing a per&s;on downward from the battlements of a high tower. Some effects are probable only: I labour, for example, in order to provide for my family; fight for my country, in order to repel its enemies; take phy&s;ic, in order to re&s;tore my health. In &s;uch ca&s;es, the event in|tended does not nece&s;&s;arily nor always follow.</P>
<P>A man, when he wills to act, mu&s;t at the &s;ame time intend to produce the effect that he knows to be nece&s;&s;arily connected with the action. But where the effect is probable only, a man may proceed to act without intending to produce the effect that follows. For ex|ample, a &s;tone I throw at random into the market-place, may wound a man without my intending that effect.</P>
<P>In&s;tinctive actions, from their very definition, exclude intention: actions that nece&s;&s;arily produce their effects, mu&s;t imply intention: effects that are probable only, not nece&s;&s;ary, are &s;ometimes intended, &s;ometimes not.</P>
<P>A <HI>right</HI> and a <HI>wrong,</HI> in &s;uch actions as are done intentionally to produce &s;ome effect, are univer&s;ally acknowledged; and yet philo&s;o|phers have been much difficulted to a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;e of this eminent di&s;tinction. The various opinions that have been entertained about it, would be a delicate hi&s;torical mor&s;el; but come not within the com|pa&s;s of this &s;hort inquiry. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, negatively, that the &s;cience of morals cannot be founded on any truths that may be di&s;|covered by rea&s;oning: which will thus appear. As the faculty of rea&s;on is confined to the inve&s;tigation of unknown truths by means of truths that are known, it is clear, that in no &s;cience can we even begin to rea&s;on, till we be provided with &s;ome <HI>data</HI> to found our rea|&s;onings upon: even in mathematics, there are certain principles or axioms perceived intuitively to be true, upon which all its demon|&s;trations are founded. Rea&s;on is indeed of great u&s;e in morality, as well as in other &s;ciences; but morality, like mathematics, is and mu&s;t be provided with certain axioms or intuitive propo&s;itions, with|out which we cannot make a &s;ingle &s;tep in our rea&s;onings upon that &s;ubject; and to trace the&s;e with care and caution is the chief pur|po&s;e of the pre&s;ent inquiry.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. The Moral Sen&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we reflect upon the different branches of &s;cience, it might &s;eem, that of all &s;ubjects human nature &s;hould be the be&s;t under&s;tood; becau&s;e every man has daily opportunities to &s;tudy it in his own pa&s;&s;ions, and in his own actions. But human nature, an intere&s;ting &s;ubject, is &s;eldom left to the cool inve&s;tigations of philo&s;o|phy. Writers of a &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition, inflamed with a warm imagi|nation, compo&s;e man mo&s;tly or wholly of benevolent principles: o|thers, of a cold temperament and narrow views, bring him down to be an animal entirely &s;elfi&s;h. The&s;e &s;y&s;tems are equally di&s;tant from truth: man is of a complex nature, endued with various prin|ciples, &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h &s;ome &s;ocial; and it is highly expedient that man &s;hould be &s;o framed, in order to act the part that is allotted him in this life. The unhappy progre&s;s of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, e&s;pecially among commercial nations, is a favourite topic of declamation; and facts are accumulated without end to inforce that topic. It would be no difficult ta&s;k to produce in&s;tances, not le&s;s numerous, of benevo|lence, genero&s;ity, and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e oppo|&s;ite in&s;tances, what can any &s;en&s;ible per&s;on fairly conclude, but that the &s;ocial and &s;elfi&s;h principles are, by divine wi&s;dom, &s;o blended as to fit man for his pre&s;ent &s;tate? But &s;uppo&s;ing &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s to pre|vail in action, it certainly prevails not in &s;entiment, nor in affection: all men equally con&s;pire to put a high e&s;timation upon genero&s;ity, benevolence, and other &s;ocial qualities; while even the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h are di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in others, and can &s;carce be reconciled to it in them&s;elves. Another fact, equally worthy of attention, pro|ceeds from the &s;ame cau&s;e with the former. Laying a&s;ide particular prejudices ari&s;ing from love or hatred, good fortune happening to any one is agreeable to all, and bad fortune happening to any one is di&s;agreeable to all. Hence effects or events, whether produced by the operation of the laws of matter, or by the actions of &s;elf-motive beings, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into three kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> agreeable, di&s;a|greeable, and indifferent. Beneficial effects or events are agreeable: hurtful effects or events are di&s;agreeable: and tho&s;e that are neither beneficial nor hurtful, are indifferent.</P>
<P>The&s;e preliminaries lead directly to the true foundation of mora|lity,
<PB N="4" REF="13">
which foundation is di&s;covered upon taking under con&s;ideration effects or events produced by human actions. An agreeable effect or event produced intentionally by acting, is perceived by all to be <HI>good</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hence the intimate connection between morality and the fine arts. <Q REND="inline">"It has always been my opinion,"</Q> &s;ays a celebrated writer, <Q REND="inline">"that the good and the agreeable are nearly related; and that a mind &s;en&s;ible to the charms of virtue, mu&s;t equally be &s;en&s;ible to tho&s;e of beauty."</Q></NOTE>: a di&s;agreeable effect or event produced intentionally by act|ing, is perceived by all to be <HI>ill:</HI> and an indifferent effect or event is not in our perception either good or ill. The&s;e perceptions of good and of ill are the primary moral perceptions, with which, as will be &s;een afterward, every other moral perception is intimately con|nected.</P>
<P>In an attempt to inve&s;tigate the true foundation of morality, an effect or event, being the end for which we act, pre&s;ents it&s;elf fir&s;t to the mind as its capital object: an action is only a mean employ'd to produce &s;ome effect or event, and means are always &s;ubordinate to the end. For this rea&s;on, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to vary from other writers upon moral philo&s;ophy, who begin with actions as the capi|tal object, without giving due attention to the ends for which we act.</P>
<P><HI>Good</HI> and <HI>ill,</HI> like agreeable and di&s;agreeable, bitter and &s;weet, hard and &s;oft, are &s;imple qualities, incapable of a definition; and, like the&s;e, and all other qualities, are objects of perception, independ|ent of con&s;equences, and independent of rea&s;oning or reflection. I illu&s;trate this doctrine by the following examples: We require no ar|gument to prove, that children of the poor bred to u&s;eful employ|ments by means of a charitable endowment, an infant re&s;cued from the jaws of a lion, a &s;ick per&s;on re&s;tored to health, the hungry fed, and the naked cloathed, are good effects; they are perceived to be &s;uch intuitively: an argument is as little nece&s;&s;ary to prove, that an old man abandoned to poverty by his favourite &s;on in opulent cir|cum&s;tances, a virtuous young woman corrupted by artifice, are ill effects; and that breach of engagement, and harm done to one who dreads no harm from us, are equally &s;o: the&s;e effects are perceived intuitively to be ill.</P>
<P>Next as to actions con&s;idered as means productive of effects. To the qualities of good and ill in effects, corre&s;pond the qualities of <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> in actions: An agreeable effect produced intentional|ly, is perceived to be good; and the action by which it is produced, is perceived to be right: a di&s;agreeable effect produced intentionally
<PB N="5" REF="14">
is perceived to be ill; and the action by which it is produced, is perceived to be wrong <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The &s;en&s;e we have that an action is right when intended to produce a good effect, and wrong when intended to produce an ill effect, may &s;eem to be the re&s;ult of rea&s;oning, not merely of perception. But it is not &s;o in reality: for though by the power of ab&s;traction an action may be con&s;idered &s;ingly, without joining it either to its cau&s;e, or to its effect; yet when we do not ab&s;tract, we con&s;ider it in its natural appearance as connected with both; and in this view we perceive, at the fir&s;t glance, without rea&s;oning, an action connected by intention with a good effect to be right, and an action connected by intention with an ill effect to be wrong.</NOTE>. And as it will be &s;een afterward, that &s;ome effects are perceived to be ill without being intended; it will al&s;o be &s;een, that the actions by which &s;uch effects are produced, are perceived to be wrong.</P>
<P>An action is perceived to be right or wrong according to the ef|fect intended, whether the effect follow or not. Thus, if to &s;ave my friend from being drowned, I plunge into a river, the action is right though I come too late: and if I aim a &s;troke at a man be|hind his back, the action is wrong though I happen not to touch him.</P>
<P>It holds in actions as in effects: good effects are a &s;pecies of a|greeable effects, and right actions a &s;pecies of agreeable actions: ill effects are a &s;pecies of di&s;agreeable effects, and wrong actions a &s;pecies of di&s;agreeable actions.</P>
<P>Thus, right and wrong, like good and ill, and all other qualities, are objects of perception or intuition; and &s;uppo&s;ing them hid from our perception, an attempt to di&s;cover them by rea&s;oning would be ab&s;urd; not le&s;s &s;o, than &s;uch an attempt with re&s;pect to beauty or co|lour, or with re&s;pect to the external objects to which the&s;e qualities belong.</P>
<P>For the &s;ake of per&s;picuity, the foregoing ob&s;ervations are confi|ned to the &s;imple&s;t ca&s;e, that of an effect or event produced inten|tionally. When we afterward de&s;cend to particulars, there will be occa&s;ion to &s;how, fir&s;t, That if in acting we fore&s;ee the probability of a di&s;agreeable effect, though without intending it, the effect in that ca&s;e is perceived to be ill, and the action to be wrong; but not in &s;uch a degree as when intended: and, next, That if the di&s;agree|able effect, though not fore&s;een, might have been fore&s;een, it is al&s;o perceived to be ill, and the action wrong, though in a &s;till lower degree.</P>
<P>As in&s;tinctive actions are cau&s;ed by blind in&s;tinct, without the lea&s;t view to con&s;equences, they are not perceived to be right or
<PB N="6" REF="15">
wrong, but indifferent: and the effects produced by them may be agreeable or di&s;agreeable; but they are not perceived to be good or ill; they are al&s;o indifferent.</P>
<P>Right actions are di&s;tingui&s;hable into two kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> what <HI>ought</HI> to be done, and what <HI>may</HI> be done or left undone. Wrong actions are all of one &s;ort, <HI>viz.</HI> what ought not to be done. Right actions that may be done or left undone, are, from our very conception of them, a matter of choice: they are right when done; but it is not a wrong to leave them undone. Thus, to remit a ju&s;t debt for the &s;ake of a growing family; to yield a &s;ubject in controver&s;y, rather than go to law with a neighbour; generou&s;ly to return good for ill, are right actions, univer&s;ally approved: yet every man is &s;en&s;ible, that &s;uch actions are left to his free will, and that he is not bound to per|form any of them.</P>
<P>Actions that <HI>ought</HI> to be done, as well as actions that <HI>ought not</HI> to be done, merit peculiar attention; becau&s;e they give occa&s;ion to the moral terms <HI>duty</HI> and <HI>obligation;</HI> which come next in order. To &s;ay that an action ought to be done, means that we have no liberty nor choice, but are nece&s;&s;arily tied or obliged to perform: and to &s;ay that an action ought not to be done, means that we are nece&s;&s;arily re&s;trained from doing it. Though this nece&s;&s;ity be moral only, not phy&s;ical; yet we conceive our&s;elves deprived by it of liberty and choice, and bound to act, or to forbear acting, in oppo&s;ition to eve|ry other motive. The nece&s;&s;ity here de&s;cribed is termed <HI>duty:</HI> the ab&s;taining from harming the innocent is a proper example; which the moral &s;en&s;e makes an indi&s;pen&s;able duty, without leaving a &s;ingle article of it to our own free will.</P>
<P>If I be bound in duty to perform or to forbear any particular action, there mu&s;t be a <HI>title</HI> or <HI>right</HI> in &s;ome per&s;on to exact that duty from me; and accordingly a <HI>duty</HI> or <HI>obligation</HI> nece&s;&s;arily implies a <HI>title</HI> or <HI>right.</HI> Thus, the duty of ab&s;taining from mi&s;chief implies a right in others to be &s;ecured again&s;t mi&s;chief: the man who does an injury, perceives that he has done wrong by violating the right of the per&s;on injured; and that per&s;on hath a perception of &s;uffering wrong by having his right violated.</P>
<P>Our duty is two-fold; duty to others, and duty to our&s;elves. With re&s;pect to others, an action that we ought to do is termed <HI>ju&s;t;</HI> an action that we ought not to do is termed <HI>unju&s;t;</HI> and the omi&s;&s;ion of what we ought to do is al&s;o termed <HI>unju&s;t.</HI> With re&s;pect to our&s;elves, an action that we ought to do is termed <HI>proper;</HI> and an action that
<PB N="7" REF="16">
we ought not to do, as well as the omi&s;&s;ion of what we ought to do, are termed <HI>improper.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, <HI>right,</HI> &s;ignifying a quality of certain actions, is a genus, of which <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> are &s;pecies: and <HI>wrong,</HI> &s;ignifying a quality of other actions, is a genus, of which <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and <HI>improper</HI> are &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e by which we perceive the qualities of <HI>good</HI> and <HI>ill</HI> in ef|fects&punc; of <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> in actions, and the other moral qualities mentioned and to be mentioned, is termed the MORAL SENSE or CONSCIENCE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Every perception, being an act of the mind, mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome faculty or power of perception, termed <HI>&s;en&s;e.</HI> Whether the moral &s;en&s;e, by which we perceive a right and a wrong in actions, and a good and an ill in effects, be a &s;en&s;e di&s;tinct from all others, or whether it make a branch of the &s;en&s;e by which we perceive the actions them&s;elves, and their effects, appears an arbitrary que&s;tion: the &s;en&s;es by which objects are perceived, are not &s;eparated from each other by di&s;tinct boundaries; and the &s;orting or cla&s;&s;ing them, &s;eems to depend more on ta&s;te and fancy than on nature. For this rea&s;on, I have followed the plan laid down by former writers; which is, to con&s;ider the moral &s;en&s;e as a &s;en&s;e di&s;tinct from others, becau&s;e it is the ea&s;ie&s;t and cleare&s;t manner of conceiving it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is no cau&s;e for doubting the exi&s;tence of the moral &s;en&s;e, more than for doubting the exi&s;tence of the &s;en&s;e of beauty, of the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing, of hearing, or of any other &s;en&s;e. In fact, the per|ception of right and wrong as qualities of actions, is not le&s;s di&s;tinct and clear than that of beauty, of colour, or of any other quality; and as every perception is an act of &s;en&s;e, the &s;en&s;e of beauty is not with greater certainty evinced from the perception of beauty, than the moral &s;en&s;e is from the perception of right and wrong.</P>
<P>This is the corner-&s;tone of morality: for, ab&s;tracting from the moral &s;en&s;e, the qualities of good and ill in effects, and of right and wrong in actions, would be altogether inexplicable. We find this &s;en&s;e di&s;tributed among individuals in different degrees of perfec|tion: but there perhaps never exi&s;ted any one above the condition of an idiot, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it not in &s;ome degree; and were any man entirely de&s;titute of it, the terms <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> would to him be not le&s;s unintelligible than the term <HI>colour</HI> is to one born blind.</P>
<P>That every individual is endued with a &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, more or le&s;s di&s;tinct, will readily be granted; but whether there be among men what may be termed a COMMON SENSE of right and wrong, producing uniformity of opinion as to what actions are right and what wrong, is not &s;o evident. There appears nothing ab&s;urd in &s;uppo&s;ing the opinions of men about right and wrong to be as various as their faces; and the hi&s;tory of mankind leads us to &s;u|&s;pect, that this &s;uppo&s;ition is not de&s;titute of foundation. For from
<PB N="8" REF="17">
that hi&s;tory it appears, that among different nations, and even in the &s;ame nation at different periods, the opinions publicly e&s;pou&s;ed with regard to right and wrong are extremely various; that among &s;ome nations it was held lawful for a man to &s;ell his children as &s;laves, and in their infancy to abandon them to wild bea&s;ts; that it was held equally lawful to puni&s;h children, even capitally, for the crime of their parent; that the murdering an enemy in cold blood, was once a common practice; that human &s;acrifices, impious not le&s;s than immoral according to our notions, were of old univer&s;al; that even in later times, it has been held meritorious to inflict cruel torments for the &s;lighte&s;t deviations from the religious creed of the plurality; and that among the mo&s;t enlightened nations, there are con|&s;iderable differences with re&s;pect to the rules of morality.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts, however well founded, tend not to di&s;prove the reality of a common &s;en&s;e as to morals: they only evince, that the moral &s;en&s;e has not been equally perfect at all times, and in all countries: which is not &s;urpri&s;ing, being the ca&s;e of all our more refined &s;en&s;es and faculties; witne&s;s, in particular, the &s;en&s;e of beauty, of elegance, of propriety. And with regard to this point, the following ob&s;erva|tion may give &s;atisfaction. In the order of Providence, the progre&s;s of our &s;pecies toward perfection re&s;embles that of an individual: we may ob&s;erve an infancy in both; and in both a gradual pro|gre&s;s toward maturity: nor is the re&s;emblance the le&s;s perfect, that certain tribes, like certain individuals, ripen fa&s;ter than others. The &s;avage &s;tate is the infancy of man; during which the more delicate &s;en&s;es lie dormant, abandoning nations to the authority of cu&s;tom, of imitation, and of pa&s;&s;ion, without any ju&s;t ta&s;te of morals more than of the fine arts. But nations, like individuals, ripen gradual|ly, and acquire in time a refined ta&s;te in morals, as well as in the fine arts; after which we find great uniformity of opinion about the rules of right and wrong, with few exceptions but what may proceed from imbecillity, or corrupted education. There may be found, it is true, even in the mo&s;t enlightened ages, &s;ome men who have &s;ingu|lar notions upon &s;ome points of morality; and there may be found the like &s;ingularity upon many other &s;ubjects: which affords no argu|ment again&s;t a common &s;en&s;e or &s;tandard of right and wrong, more than a mon&s;ter doth again&s;t the &s;tandard that regulates our external form, nor more than an exception doth again&s;t the truth of a gene|ral propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>That there is in mankind a common &s;en&s;e of what is right and wrong, and an uniformity of opinion, is a matter of fact, of which
<PB N="9" REF="18">
the only infallible proof is ob&s;ervation and experience: and to that proof I appeal; entering only one caveat, That, for the rea&s;on above given, the inquiry be confined to nations of poli&s;hed manners. In the mean time I take the liberty to &s;ugge&s;t an argument from ana|logy, That if there be great uniformity among the different tribes of men in &s;eeing and hearing, in truth and fal&s;ehood, in plea&s;ure and pain, &amp;c. what cau&s;e can we have for &s;u&s;pecting that right and wrong are an exception from the general rule? Whatever minute differences there may be to di&s;tingui&s;h one per&s;on from another; yet in the general principles that con&s;titute our nature, internal and ex|ternal, there is wonderful uniformity.</P>
<P>That man is by nature a &s;ocial being, is evident from many of his principles and faculties, calculated chiefly or &s;olely to qualify him for the &s;ocial &s;tate. This is eminently the ca&s;e of the moral &s;en&s;e; the very purpo&s;e of which is, to regulate our conduct in &s;o|ciety. That the uniformity of this &s;en&s;e among the different tribes of men, intitling it to be termed <HI>the common &s;en&s;e of mankind,</HI> mu&s;t be calculated for the further improvement of &s;ociety, is highly pro|bable; and yet does not appear altogether &s;o clear at fir&s;t view. For may it not be urged, that we are bound notwith&s;tanding to re|gulate our conduct by our own &s;en&s;e or private conviction; and that to act otherwi&s;e would be to act again&s;t con&s;cience? This ar|gument is at lea&s;t plau&s;ible; and if it hold true, &s;ociety, it mu&s;t be yielded, cannot be benefited by a &s;tandard that is not calculated to regulate any branch of our conduct. But the Almighty leaves no imperfection in his works: he intended man for &s;ociety; he endued him with a &s;en&s;e of right and wrong; he made the perceptions of that &s;en&s;e uniform in all men; and to complete us for &s;ociety, he has moulded our nature &s;o admirably, as that even the man who has the mo&s;t correct &s;en&s;e of morals, is not better qualified for &s;ociety, than they are who deviate the farthe&s;t from it. The contrivance, &s;imple and beautiful, is, to bind us by a law in our nature to regu|late our conduct by the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, even in oppo&s;i|tion to what otherwi&s;e would be our own &s;en&s;e or private conviction. And that this truly is the &s;y&s;tem of nature, I endeavour to make out as follows.</P>
<P>We have an innate &s;en&s;e or conviction of a common nature, not only in our own &s;pecies, but in every &s;pecies of animals: and our conviction is verified by experience; for there appears a remarkable uniformity among creatures of the &s;ame kind, and a di&s;&s;ormity, not le&s;s remarkable, among creatures of different kinds. This common
<PB N="10" REF="19">
nature is conceived to be a model or &s;tandard for each individual of the kind. Hence it is a matter of wonder, to find an individual deviating from the common nature of the &s;pecies, whether in its in|ternal or external &s;tructure: a child born with aver&s;ion to its mo|ther's milk, is a wonder, not le&s;s than if born without a mouth, or with more than one.</P>
<P>Secondly, With re&s;pect to the common nature of man in particu|lar, we have an innate conviction, that it is invariable not le&s;s than univer&s;al; that it will be the &s;ame hereafter as at pre&s;ent, and as it was in time pa&s;t; the &s;ame among all nations, and in all corners of the earth. Nor are we deceived; becau&s;e giving allowance for the difference of culture, and gradual refinement of manners, the fact cor|re&s;ponds to our conviction.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We have an innate conviction, that this common nature or &s;tandard is PERFECT and RIGHT; and that every individual OUGHT to be framed according to it. Every remarkable devia|tion from the &s;tandard, makes an impre&s;&s;ion upon us of imper|fection, irregularity, or di&s;order; and rai&s;es a painful emotion: mon|&s;trous births, exciting the curio&s;ity of a philo&s;opher, fail not at the &s;ame time to excite aver&s;ion in a high degree.</P>
<P>This conviction of perfection in the common nature of man, reaches every branch of his nature; and particularly his &s;en&s;e of the morality and immorality of actions, termed the <HI>moral &s;en&s;e.</HI> This &s;en&s;e accordingly, con&s;idered as a branch of the common nature of man, is admitted by all to be perfect; and, con&s;equently, to be the ultimate and unerring &s;tandard of morals; to which all are bound to &s;ubmit, even in oppo&s;ition to their own private &s;en&s;e of right and wrong. At the &s;ame time, as this &s;tandard, through infirmity or prejudice, is not con&s;picuous to every individual, we find in&s;tances, not few in number, of per&s;ons deluded into erroneous moral opi|nions, by mi&s;taking a fal&s;e &s;tandard for that of nature. And hence, with re&s;pect to individuals, a di&s;tinction between a right and a wrong &s;en&s;e in morals; a di&s;tinction which, from the conviction of a moral &s;tandard, is obvious to the meane&s;t capacity; but of which di&s;tinc|tion we could not otherwi&s;e have the &s;lighte&s;t conception.</P>
<P>The final cau&s;e of this branch of our con&s;titution is illu&s;trious. Were there no &s;tandard of right and wrong for determining our end|le&s;s controver&s;ies about matters of intere&s;t, the &s;trong would have recour&s;e to open violence; the weak to cunning, deceit, and treache|ry; and &s;ociety would be altogether intolerable. Courts of law could afford no re&s;ource: for without a &s;tandard of morals, their de|ci&s;ions
<PB N="11" REF="20">
mu&s;t be arbitrary, and con&s;equently have no authority nor influence.</P>
<P>Happy it is for men, that in all their di&s;putes about right and wrong, they have this &s;tandard to appeal to: it is nece&s;&s;ary, that in &s;ociety the actions of individuals be uniform with re&s;pect to right and wrong; and in order to uniformity of action, it is nece&s;&s;ary that their perceptions of right and wrong be uniform: to produce &s;uch u|niformity, a &s;tandard of morals is indi&s;pen&s;able; which is daily ap|plied by judges with great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>To complete this theory, it mu&s;t be added, that, independent of the author's opinion, it is the goodne&s;s or illne&s;s of the effect intend|ed which qualifies an action to be right or wrong. Thus, when a man impelled by friend&s;hip or pity, re&s;cues from the flames one con|demned to be burnt for here&s;y, the action is right, even though the man, convinced that heretics ought to be de&s;troy'd, be of opinion that the action is wrong.</P>
<P>But with re&s;pect to the author of the action, nature leads us to judge of him by a different rule. He is approved, and held to be INNOCENT, when he does what he him&s;elf thinks right: he is di&s;|approved, and held to be GUILTY, when he does what he him&s;elf thinks wrong. Thus, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate an Athei&s;t for the &s;ake of religion, is a wrong action: and yet the enthu&s;ia&s;t who commits that wrong may be innocent: and one is guilty who, contrary to con&s;cience, eats meat in Lent, though the action is not wrong. Upon the whole, an action is perceived to be right or wrong independent of the au|thor's own opinion: but he is approved or di&s;approved, held to be innocent or guilty, according to his own opinion.</P>
<P>We learn from experience, as above, that every right action is a|greeable, and every wrong action di&s;agreeable. But the author ap|pears to us in a different light: he is agreeable when he acts accor|ding to con&s;cience, though the action be wrong; and di&s;agreeable when he acts again&s;t con&s;cience, though the action be right. He is, however, more agreeable, when he does a right action according to con&s;cience; and more di&s;agreeable, when he does a wrong action a|gain&s;t con&s;cience&punc; in which light he mu&s;t always appear to him&s;elf; for when he acts according to con&s;cience, he mu&s;t think the action right; and when he acts again&s;t con&s;cience, he mu&s;t think the action wrong.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Laws of Nature that regulate our conduct in Society.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;tandard for morals, which lays a &s;olid foundation for the &s;cience of morality, the regular pro|gre&s;s is, to inve&s;tigate the laws that are derived from this &s;tandard: and the&s;e laws may be &s;hortly defined, <Q REND="inline">"Rules of conduct that are declared to be &s;uch by the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, which is the moral &s;tandard."</Q></P>
<P>When we endeavour to inve&s;tigate the laws of nature, tho&s;e regu|larly take the lead that concern our duty: and as duty is of two kinds, duty to others, and duty to our&s;elves, we begin with the for|mer. Of the duties we owe to others, &s;ome tend to action, &s;ome to re&s;traint; and before entering into particulars, it may be proper to pre&s;ent them in a general view. There is one duty &s;o general as to comprehend all mankind for its object, all at lea&s;t that are inno|cent; and that is the duty of forbearing to hurt others, whether externally or internally. A man may be hurt externally in his goods, in his per&s;on and relations, and in his reputation. Hence the laws, Thou mu&s;t not &s;teal, Thou mu&s;t not defraud others, Thou mu&s;t not kill nor wound, Thou mu&s;t not be guilty of defamation.</P>
<P>A man may be hurt internally by an action that occa&s;ions to him di&s;tre&s;s of mind; and he may be hurt internally by receiving fal&s;e notions of men and things. Therefore in dealing or conver&s;ing with others, con&s;cience dictates that we ought not to treat them di&s;|re&s;pectfully; that we ought not cau&s;ele&s;sly to alienate their affections from others, nor the affections of others from them; and, in general, that we ought to forbear whatever may tend to break their peace of mind, or tend to unqualify them for being good men and good ci|tizens.</P>
<P>Our active duties regard particular per&s;ons, &s;uch as our relations, our friends, our benefactors, our ma&s;ters, our &s;ervants, &amp;c.; and the&s;e duties are more or le&s;s exten&s;ive, in proportion to the degree of connection. We ought to honour and obey our parents; be affec|tionate to our children, and endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h them in the world with all advantages, internal and external: we ought to be faithful to our friends, grateful to our benefactors, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to our ma&s;ters, and kind to our &s;ervants: and, according to our ability,
<PB N="13" REF="22">
we ought to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of each of them. To be obliged to do good to others beyond the&s;e bounds, mu&s;t depend on po&s;itive en|gagement: for, as will appear afterward, univer&s;al benevolence is a virtue only, not a duty.</P>
<P>Being prepared for particulars by this general &s;ketch, the fir&s;t duty that comes in view, is that which re&s;trains us from harming the in|nocent; and to it corre&s;ponds a right in the innocent to be &s;afe from harm. This is the great law preparatory to &s;ociety; becau&s;e without it &s;ociety could never have exi&s;ted. In this duty, the inflexibility of the moral &s;en&s;e is peculiarly remarkable; for it dictates, that we ought to &s;ubmit to any di&s;tre&s;s, even death it&s;elf, rather than procure our own &s;afety by laying violent hands upon an innocent per&s;on. And we are under the &s;ame re&s;traint with re&s;pect to the property of another; for robbery and theft are never upon any pretext indulged. It is true, that a man in extreme hunger may lawfully take food where he can find it; and may freely lay hold of his neighbour's hor&s;e, to carry him from an enemy who threatens death. But the rea&s;on is, that the proprietor's con&s;ent may ju&s;tly be pre&s;umed in &s;uch ca&s;es, upon our &s;ubmitting to make up the lo&s;s: it is the duty of the proprietor, as a fellow-creature, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in di&s;tre&s;s; and I may lawfully take what he ought to offer, and what I rea&s;on|ably pre&s;ume he would offer were he pre&s;ent. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, if in a &s;torm my &s;hip be drove among the anchor-ropes of another &s;hip, which ropes I am forc'd to cut in order to get free, the act is lawful, provided I be willing to pay the value. This provi&s;ion is e|quitable: for if, on the one hand, my neighbour be bound to aid me in di&s;tre&s;s, rea&s;on and con&s;cience bind me, on the other, to make up his lo&s;s, as far as in my power <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This doctrine is founded on the principle of ju&s;tice; and yet there are in the Roman law two pa&s;&s;ages which deny any recompence in &s;uch ca&s;es. <Q REND="inline">"Item Labeo &s;cribit, &s;i cum vi ventorum navis impul&s;a e&s;&s;et in &s;unes anchorarum alterius, et nautae &s;unes praecidi&s;&s;ent, &s;i nullo alio modo, ni&s;i praeci&s;is &s;unibus, explicare &s;e potuit, nullam actionem dandam;"</Q> <HI>l</HI> 29. &sect; 3. <HI>ad. leg.

<P><PB N="14" REF="23">
The prohibition of hurting others internally, is perhaps not e&s;&s;en|tial to the formation of &s;ocieties, becau&s;e the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of that law doth not much alarm plain people: but among people of man|ners and refined &s;entiments, the mind is &s;u&s;ceptible of more grievous wounds than the body; and therefore without that law a poli&s;hed &s;ociety could have no long endurance.</P>
<P>By adultery mi&s;chief is done both external and internal. Each &s;ex is &s;o con&s;tituted as to require &s;trict fidelity and attachment in their mates; and the breach of this fidelity is the greate&s;t external mi&s;chief that can befal them. It is al&s;o a hurt internally, by break|ing their peace of mind. It has indeed been urged, That this hurt will be avoided if the adultery be kept &s;ecret; and therefore that there can be no crime where there is no di&s;covery. But they who rea&s;on thus do not advert, that to declare &s;ecret adultery to be law|ful is in effect to overturn every foundation of mutual tru&s;t and fide|lity in the married &s;tate <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It is clear beyond all doubt, &s;ays a reputable writer, that no man is permitted to violate his faith; and that the man is unju&s;t and barbarous who deprives his wife of the only reward &s;he has for adhering to the au&s;tere duties of her &s;ex. But an unfaithful wife is &s;till more criminal, by di&s;&s;olving the whole ties of nature: in giving to her hu&s;band children that are not his, &s;he betrays both, and joins perfidy to infidelity; <HI>Emile, liv.</HI> 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Veracity is commonly ranked among the active duties: but erro|neou&s;ly; for if a man be not bound to &s;peak, he cannot be bound to &s;peak truth. It is therefore only a re&s;training duty, importing that we ought not to deceive others by affirming what is not true. Among the many corre&s;ponding principles in the human mind, a principle of veracity <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Truth is always uppermo&s;t, being the natural i&s;&s;ue of the mind: it requires no art nor training, no inducement nor temptation, but only that we yield to a natural impul&s;e. Lying, on the contrary, is doing violence to our nature; and is never practi&s;ed, even by the wor&s;t men, without &s;ome temptation. Speaking truth is like u&s;ing our natural food, which we would do from appetite, although it an&s;wered no end: lying is like taking phy&s;ic, which is nau&s;eous to the ta&s;te, and which no man takes but for &s;ome end which he cannot o|therwi&s;e attain; <HI>Dr Reid's Inquiry into the human mind.</HI></NOTE>, and a principle that leads us to believe what is &s;aid to us, are two: without the latter, the former would be an u&s;ele&s;s principle; and without the former, the latter would be a dangerous one, laying us open to fraud and deceit. The moral &s;en&s;e accordingly dictates, that we ought to adhere &s;trictly to truth, without regard to con&s;equences.</P>
<P>From this it mu&s;t not be inferred, that we are bound to explain our thoughts when the truth is demanded from us by unlawful force. Words uttered voluntarily are naturally relied on as expre&s;&s;ing the &s;peaker's mind; and if he fal&s;ify their meaning, he tells a lie,
<PB N="15" REF="24">
and is guilty of deceit. But words drawn from a man by unlawful force, are no evidence of his mind; and therefore, to &s;ave his life in &s;uch circum&s;tances, it is no infringement of duty to utter whate|ver words may be agreeable, however alien from his thoughts: there is no rea&s;on to pre&s;ume, in this ca&s;e, any corre&s;pondence between his words and his mind; and if the author of the unlawful vio|lence &s;uffer him&s;elf to be deceived, he mu&s;t blame him&s;elf, not the &s;peaker.</P>
<P>It need &s;carce be mentioned, that the duty of veracity excludes not fable, nor any liberty of &s;peech intended for amu&s;ement, and not to be a voucher of truth.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t active duty I &s;hall mention in particular, is that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between parents and children. The relation of parent and child, being one of the &s;tronge&s;t that can exi&s;t among individuals, makes mutual benevolence between the&s;e per&s;ons an indi&s;pen&s;able duty. Benevolence among other blood-relations is al&s;o a duty; though inferior in degree, for it wears away gradually as the relation becomes more di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Gratitude is a duty directed to a particular object; and the object of gratitude is one who&s;e kindne&s;s and good offices require &s;uitable returns. But though gratitude is &s;trictly a duty, the mea&s;ure of per|formance, and the kind, are left mo&s;tly to our own choice. It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to add, that the active duties now mentioned are ac|knowledged by all to be ab&s;olutely inflexible; perhaps more &s;o than the re&s;training duties: many find excu&s;es for doing harm; but no one hears with patience an excu&s;e for deviating from friend&s;hip or gratitude.</P>
<P>Di&s;tre&s;s tends vigorou&s;ly to convert the virtue of benevolence into a duty. But di&s;tre&s;s alone is not &s;ufficient, without other concurring circum&s;tances; for to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in general, would be a du|ty far beyond the reach of the mo&s;t powerful prince that ever exi&s;ted. Our relations in di&s;tre&s;s claim this duty from us, and even our neigh|bours; but di&s;tant di&s;tre&s;s, where there is no particular connection, &s;carce rou&s;es our &s;ympathy, and never is an object of duty. Many o|ther connections, too numerous for this &s;hort e&s;&s;ay, extend the duty of relieving others from di&s;tre&s;s; and the&s;e naturally make a large branch in every treati&s;e upon equity.</P>
<P>One great advantage of &s;ociety is, the co-operation of many to accompli&s;h &s;ome u&s;eful end, for which a &s;ingle hand would be in&s;uf|ficient. All the arts, manufactures, and commercial dealings, re|quire many hands, which cannot be depended on if there be no en|gagement;
<PB N="16" REF="25">
and therefore the performance of promi&s;es and covenants is in &s;ociety a capital <HI>duty.</HI> In their original occupations of hunting and fi&s;hing, men, living &s;cattered and di&s;per&s;ed, had &s;eldom oppor|tunity to aid and benefit each other; and in that &s;ituation covenants, being of little u&s;e, were little regarded. But hu&s;bandry, being fa|vourable to population, and requiring the co-operation of many hands, drew men together for mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and then covenants began to make a figure: arts and commerce made them more and more nece&s;&s;ary; and by the improvement of man's nature in &s;ociety, the utmo&s;t regard at pre&s;ent is had to them.</P>
<P>But contracts and promi&s;es are not confined to commercial deal|ings: they &s;erve al&s;o to make benevolence a duty, independent of any pecuniary intere&s;t. They are even extended &s;o far, as to connect the living with the dead. A man would die with regret, if he thought his friends were not bound by the promi&s;es they make to fulfil his will after his death: and to quiet the minds of men with re&s;pect to futurity, the moral &s;en&s;e makes the performing &s;uch promi&s;es our duty. Thus, if I promi&s;e to my friend to erect a monument for him after his death, con&s;cience binds me, even though no per&s;on alive be intitled to demand performance: every one holds this to be my duty; and I mu&s;t lay my account to &s;uffer reproach and blame, if I neglect my engagement.</P>
<P>To fulfil a rational promi&s;e or covenant deliberately made, is a du|ty not le&s;s inflexible than tho&s;e duties are which ari&s;e independent of con&s;ent. But as man is fallible, liable to fraud and impo&s;ition, and to be mi&s;led by ignorance or error, his ca&s;e would be deplorable, were he compelled by the moral &s;en&s;e to fulfil every engagement, however imprudent or irrational. Here the moral &s;en&s;e, bending to circum&s;tances, is accommodated to the fallible nature of man: it relieves him from deceit, from impo&s;ition, from ignorance, and from error; and binds him to no engagement but what fairly an&s;wers the end propo&s;ed by it.</P>
<P>The other branch of duties, comprehending tho&s;e we owe to our|&s;elves, may be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a few words. The &s;en&s;e of propriety, a branch of the moral &s;en&s;e, regulates our conduct with re&s;pect to our|&s;elves; as the &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, another branch of the moral &s;en&s;e, re|gulates our conduct with re&s;pect to others. The &s;en&s;e of propriety dictates, that we ought to act &s;uitably to the dignity of our nature, and to the &s;tation allotted us by Providence; and, in particular, that temperance, prudence, mode&s;ty, and regularity of conduct, are &s;elf|duties. The&s;e duties contribute greatly to private happine&s;s, by
<PB N="17" REF="26">
pre&s;erving health, peace of mind, and a ju&s;tly founded &s;elf-e&s;teem; which are great ble&s;&s;ings: they contribute not le&s;s to happine&s;s in &s;o|ciety, by procuring love and e&s;teem, and con&s;equently aid and &s;up|port in time of need.</P>
<P>Upon reviewing the foregoing duties re&s;pecting others, we find them more or le&s;s exten&s;ive; but none of them &s;o exten&s;ive as to have for their object the good of mankind in general. The mo&s;t exten&s;ive duty is that of re&s;traint, prohibiting us to harm others: but even this duty &s;uffers an exception re&s;pecting tho&s;e who merit puni&s;hment. The active duties of doing good are circum&s;cribed within much nar|rower bounds; requiring an intimate relation for their object, &s;uch as what we bear to our parents, our children, our friends, our bene|factors. The &s;lighter relations are not an object, unle&s;s with the ad|dition of peculiar circum&s;tances: neighbourhood, for example, does not alone make benevolence a duty; but &s;uppo&s;ing a neighbour to be in di&s;tre&s;s, we become bound to relieve him in proportion to our a|bility. For it is remarkable in human nature, that though we al|ways &s;ympathi&s;e with our relations, and with tho&s;e under our eye, the di&s;tre&s;s of per&s;ons remote and unknown affects us very little. Pactions and agreements become nece&s;&s;ary, where the purpo&s;e is to extend the duty of benevolence, in any particular, beyond the bounds mentioned. Men, it is true, are &s;ometimes capable of doing more good than is pre&s;cribed to them as a duty; but every &s;uch good mu&s;t be voluntary.</P>
<P>And this leads to moral acts that are left to our own will to be done or left undone; which is the &s;econd general branch of moral ac|tions mentioned above. Writers differ &s;trangely about the benevo|lence of man. Some hold him to be merely a &s;elfi&s;h being, inca|pable of any motive to action but what ultimately re&s;pects him&s;elf: this is too bold an a&s;&s;ertion, being contradictory to the experience of all ages, which affords the cleare&s;t conviction, that men frequently act for the good of others, without regard to their own good, and &s;ometimes in direct oppo&s;ition to it. Other writers, running to the oppo&s;ite extreme, advance benevolence to be a duty, maintaining that every one of the human race is intitled to all the good we can po&s;&s;ibly do them: which bani&s;hes every con&s;ideration of &s;elf-intere&s;t, other than what we owe to our&s;elves as a part of the general &s;ociety of men. This doctrine is not le&s;s contradictory to experience than the former: for we find that men generally are di&s;po&s;ed to prefer their own intere&s;t before that of tho&s;e with whom they have no particu|lar
<PB N="18" REF="27">
connection: nor do we find &s;uch bias controlled by the moral &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the actions that belong to the pre&s;ent branch, the moral &s;en&s;e impo&s;es no laws upon us, leaving us at freedom to act or not according to our own inclination. Taking, accordingly, under con&s;ideration any &s;ingle benevolent act by it&s;elf, it is appro|ved when done, but not condemned when left undone. But con&s;i|dering the whole of our conduct, the moral &s;en&s;e appears to vary a little. As the nature of man is complex, partly &s;ocial, partly &s;elfi&s;h, rea&s;on dictates that our conduct ought to be conformable to our na|ture; and that, in advancing our own intere&s;t, we ought not altoge|ther to neglect that of others. The man accordingly who confines his whole time and thoughts within his own little &s;phere, is con|demned by all the world as guilty of wrong conduct; and the man him&s;elf, if his moral perceptions be not blunted by &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that he de&s;erves to be condemned. On the other hand, it is po&s;&s;ible that voluntary benevolence may be extended beyond proper bounds. The true balance of the mind con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;ubordi|nation of benevolence to &s;elf-love; and therefore, where that balance is &s;o varied as to give &s;uperior weight to the former, a man thus con|&s;tituted will be exce&s;&s;ive in his benevolence: he will &s;acrifice a great intere&s;t of his own to a &s;mall intere&s;t of others; and the moral &s;en&s;e dictates that &s;uch conduct is wrong.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;ubject of this chapter in general, we have rea|&s;on to pre&s;ume from the uniformity of our moral perceptions, that there mu&s;t be &s;ome general character di&s;tingui&s;hing right actions, and their good effects, from wrong actions, and their ill effects. And from the deduction above given it will appear, that the general tendency of the former is, to promote the good of &s;ociety; and of the latter, to ob&s;truct that good. Univer&s;al benevolence, as a duty, is indeed not required of man; for an evident rea&s;on, that the per|formance is beyond the reach of his utmo&s;t abilities: but for promo|ting the general good, every duty is required of him that he can ac|compli&s;h; which will appear from the &s;lighte&s;t review of the forego|ing duties. The prohibition of harming others is an ea&s;y ta&s;k, and therefore is made univer&s;al. Our active duties are in a very differ|ent condition: man is circum&s;cribed both in his capacity and powers; he cannot do good but in a &s;low &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and therefore it is wi&s;ely ordered, that the obligation he is under to do good &s;hould be confi|ned to his relations, his friends, his benefactors. Even di&s;tre&s;s can|not make benevolence a general duty: all a man can readily do, and
<PB N="19" REF="28">
all he is bound to do, is to relieve tho&s;e at hand; and accordingly we hear of di&s;tant misfortunes with very little or no concern.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, let us not mi&s;apprehend the moral &s;y&s;tem, as if it were our duty, or even lawful, to pro&s;ecute what, upon the whole, we reckon the mo&s;t beneficial to &s;ociety, balancing ill with good. In the moral &s;y&s;tem, it is not permitted to violate the mo&s;t trivial right of any one, however beneficial it may be to others. For example, a man in low circum&s;tances, by denying a debt he owes to a rich mi&s;er, &s;aves him&s;elf and a hopeful family from ruin. In this ca&s;e the good effect far outweighs the ill: but the moral &s;en&s;e admits no balancing between good and ill, and gives no quarter to inju&s;tice, whatever benefit it may produce. And hence a maxim in which all morali&s;ts agree, That we mu&s;t not do evil even to bring about good. This doctrine, at the &s;ame time, is nicely corre&s;pondent to the nature of man: were it a rule in &s;ociety, That a greater benefit to others would make it ju&s;t to deprive me of my life, of my reputation, or of my effects, I &s;hould follow the advice of a celebrated philo&s;opher, re|nounce &s;ociety, and take refuge among the &s;avages.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Principles of Duty and of Benevolence.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus &s;hortly delineated the laws of nature, we proceed to a very important article; which is, to inquire into the means provided by the author of our nature for compelling obedience to the&s;e laws. The moral &s;en&s;e is an excellent guide; but the mo&s;t ex|pert guide will avail nothing to tho&s;e who are not di&s;po&s;ed to follow him. Intuitive knowledge of what is right, cannot of it&s;elf be a motive to act righteou&s;ly, more than intuitive knowledge of what is wrong can be a motive to act unrighteou&s;ly. From this &s;ingle con&s;i|deration, it mu&s;t be evident, that, to complete the moral &s;y&s;tem, there ought to be &s;ome principle or propen&s;ity in our nature, &s;ome impelling power, to be a motive for acting when the moral &s;en&s;e &s;ays we ought to act, and to re&s;train us from acting when the moral &s;en&s;e &s;ays we ought not to act.</P>
<P>The author of our nature leaves none of his works imperfect. In order to render us ob&s;equious to the moral &s;en&s;e, as our guide, he hath implanted in our nature the three great principles, of duty, of voluntary benevolence, and of rewards and puni&s;hments.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="29">
It may po&s;&s;ibly be thought that rewards and puni&s;hments, of which afterward, are &s;ufficient of them&s;elves to inforce the laws of our nature, without nece&s;&s;ity of any other principle. Human laws, it is true, are inforc'd by the&s;e means, becau&s;e no higher &s;anction is under the command of a terre&s;trial legi&s;lator: but the cele&s;tial le|gi&s;lator, with power that knows no control, and benevolence that knows no limits, has inforc'd his laws by means not le&s;s remarkable for their mildne&s;s than for their efficacy: he employs no external compul&s;ion; but in order to engage our will on the &s;ide of moral conduct, has in the brea&s;t of every individual e&s;tabli&s;hed the princi|ples mentioned, which efficaciou&s;ly excite us to obey the dictates of the moral &s;en&s;e. Other principles may &s;olicit and allure; but the principle of duty a&s;&s;umes authority, commands, and mu&s;t be obey'd.</P>
<P>As one great advantage of &s;ociety is, the furni&s;hing opportunities without end of mutual aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, beyond what is &s;trictly our duty; nature hath di&s;po&s;ed us to do good by the principle of be|nevolence, which is a powerful incitement to be kindly, beneficent, and generous. Nor is this principle, as will afterward appear, too &s;paringly di&s;tributed: its &s;trength is &s;o nicely proportioned to our &s;i|tuation in this world, as better to an&s;wer its de&s;tination, than if it were an over-match for &s;elf-intere&s;t, and for every other principle.</P>
<P>Thus, moral actions are divided into two cla&s;&s;es: the fir&s;t regards our duty, containing actions that ought to be done, and actions that ought not to be done: the other regards actions left to our&s;elves, containing actions that are right when done, but not wrong when left undone. It will appear afterward, that the well-being of &s;ociety depends more on the fir&s;t cla&s;s than on the &s;econd; that &s;ociety is in|deed promoted by the latter; but that it can &s;carce &s;ub&s;i&s;t unle&s;s the former be made our duty. Hence it is, that actions only of the fir&s;t cla&s;s are made indi&s;pen&s;able, actions of the &s;econd cla&s;s being left to our own free will. And hence al&s;o it is, that the various principles or propen&s;ities that di&s;po&s;e us to actions of the fir&s;t &s;ort, are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of <HI>primary virtues,</HI> giving the name of <HI>&s;econdary virtues</HI> to tho&s;e principles or propen&s;ities which di&s;po&s;e us to actions of the other &s;ort <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Virtue in general &s;ignifies that di&s;po&s;ition of mind which gives the a&s;cendant to moral principles.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Rewards and Puni&s;hments.</HEAD>
<P>REFLECTING upon the moral branch of our nature qualifying us for &s;ociety in the mo&s;t perfect manner, we cannot overlook the hand of our maker; for means &s;o finely prepared to accompli&s;h an important end, never happen by chance. At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that in many men the principle of duty has not vigour nor authority &s;ufficient to &s;tem every tide of unruly pa&s;&s;ion: by the vigilance of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ions we are taken unprepared, deluded by the &s;ly in&s;inuations of others, or overwhelmed with the &s;tormy impetuo&s;ity of a third &s;ort. Moral evil thus gains ground, and much wrong is done. This new &s;cene makes it evident, that there mu&s;t be &s;ome article wanting to complete the pre&s;ent undertaking. The means provided for directing us in the road of duty are indeed explained; but as in deviating from the road wrongs are commit|ted, there is hitherto nothing &s;aid of redre&s;&s;ing the&s;e wrongs, nor of preventing the reiteration of them. To accompli&s;h the&s;e valuable ends, there are added to the moral &s;y&s;tem the principle of rewards and puni&s;hments, and that of reparation; of which in their order.</P>
<P>Such animals as are governed entirely by in&s;tinct, may be quali|fied for &s;ociety; which, among quadrupeds, is the ca&s;e of the bea|vers; and, among winged animals, of the bees, of the crows, and of &s;ome other kinds. But very few of the human actions are in|&s;tinctive: they are generally prompted by pa&s;&s;ions, of which there is an endle&s;s variety, &s;ocial and &s;elfi&s;h, benevolent and malevolent: and were every pa&s;&s;ion equally intitled to gratification, man would be utterly incapable of &s;ociety; he would be a &s;hip without a rud|der, obedient to every wind, and moving at random, without any de&s;tination. The faculty of rea&s;on would make no oppo&s;ition; for were there no &s;en&s;e of wrong, it would be rea&s;onable to grati|fy every de&s;ire that harms not our&s;elves: and to talk of pu|ni&s;hment would be ab&s;urd; for the very idea of puni&s;hment im|plies &s;ome wrong that ought to be repre&s;&s;ed. Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of the moral &s;en&s;e to qualify us for &s;ociety, and to make us ac|countable beings: by teaching us what is our duty, it renders us accountable for our actions, and makes us fit objects of rewards and puni&s;hments. The moral &s;en&s;e fulfils another valuable purpo&s;e: it
<PB N="22" REF="31">
forms in our minds an unerring &s;tandard, directing the application and the mea&s;ure of rewards and puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>But to complete the &s;y&s;tem of rewards and puni&s;hments, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that not only power, but al&s;o inclination, be conferred up|on one, or upon many, to reward and to puni&s;h. The author of our nature has provided amply for the fir&s;t, by intitling every indi|vidual to exerci&s;e that power as his native privilege. And he has equally provided for the other, by a noted principle implanted in our nature, prompting us to reward the virtuous, and to puni&s;h the vicious. Every act of duty is rewarded with our approbation: a be|nevolent act is rewarded with our e&s;teem: a generous act commands our affection. The&s;e, and other virtuous actions, have a &s;till higher reward; which is, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of merit in the author him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As to puni&s;hment, it would be incon&s;i&s;tent to puni&s;h any defect in benevolence, con&s;idered as a virtue left to our own free will. But an action done intentionally to produce mi&s;chief is criminal, and me|rits puni&s;hment: &s;uch an action being di&s;agreeable, rai&s;es my re&s;ent|ment, even though I have no connection with the per&s;on injured; and being impelled, by the principle under con&s;ideration, to puni&s;h vice, as well as to reward virtue, I mu&s;t cha&s;ti&s;e the delinquent by indignation, at lea&s;t, and hatred. An injury done to my&s;elf rai&s;es my re&s;entment to a higher pitch: I am not &s;atisfied with &s;o &s;light a puni&s;hment as indignation or hatred; the author mu&s;t by my hand &s;uffer mi&s;chief as great as he has done me.</P>
<P>Even the mo&s;t &s;ecret crime e&s;capes not puni&s;hment; for, though hid from others, it cannot be hid from the delinquent him&s;elf. It rai&s;es in him the painful pa&s;&s;ion of remor&s;e: this pa&s;&s;ion, in its &s;tronger fits, makes him wi&s;h to be puni&s;hed; and, in extreme, fre|quently impels him to be his own executioner. There cannot be i|magined a contrivance more effectual to deter us from vice; for re|mor&s;e is it&s;elf a &s;evere puni&s;hment. But this is not the whole of &s;elf-puni&s;hment: every criminal, &s;en&s;ible that he ought to be pu|ni&s;hed, dreads puni&s;hment from others; and this painful feeling, however &s;mothered during pro&s;perity, becomes extremely &s;evere in adver&s;ity, or in any depre&s;&s;ion of mind. Then it is that his crime &s;tares him in the face, and that every accidental misfortune is, in his di&s;turbed imagination, converted into a real puni&s;hment: <Q REND="inline">"And they &s;aid one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our bro|ther, in that we &s;aw the angui&s;h of his &s;oul, when he be&s;ought us; and we would not hear: therefore is this di&s;tre&s;s come upon us. And Reuben an&s;wered them, &s;aying, Spake I not unto you, &s;aying,
<PB N="23" REF="32">
Do not &s;in again&s;t the child; and ye would not hear? therefore behold al&s;o his blood is required;"</Q> <BIBL><HI>Gene&s;is</HI> xlii. 21. 22.</BIBL></P>
<P>No tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the duty we owe to our&s;elves e&s;capes puni&s;h|ment, more than the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the duty we owe to others. The puni&s;hments, though not the &s;ame, are nearly allied; and differ in degree more than in kind. Inju&s;tice is puni&s;hed by the delinquent him&s;elf with remor&s;e; impropriety with &s;hame, which is remor&s;e in a lower degree. Inju&s;tice rai&s;es indignation in the beholder, and &s;o doth every flagrant impropriety: &s;lighter improprieties receive a milder puni&s;hment, being rebuked with &s;ome degree of contempt, and frequently with deri&s;ion.</P>
<P>So far have we been carried in a beaten track: but in attempting to proceed, we are intangled in &s;everal intricacies and ob&s;tructions. Doth an action well intended, though it fall &s;hort of its aim, intitle the author to a reward; or an action ill-intended, though it happen to produce no mi&s;chief, &s;ubject him to puni&s;hment? The moral &s;en&s;e, in &s;ome individuals, is known to be &s;o perverted, as to differ, perhaps widely, from the common &s;en&s;e of mankind; mu&s;t the for|mer or the latter be the rule for puni&s;hing or rewarding &s;uch per&s;ons? At fir&s;t there will be little he&s;itation in affirming, that the common &s;en&s;e of mankind mu&s;t be the &s;tandard for rewards and puni&s;hments, as well as for civil claims: but the&s;e que&s;tions &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome doubts, which, after due examination, lead to an important di&s;covery, That rewards and puni&s;hments are regulated by a different &s;tandard.</P>
<P>It is the common &s;en&s;e of mankind that determines actions to be right or wrong, ju&s;t or unju&s;t, proper or improper. By this &s;tand|ard, all pecuniary claims are judged, all claims of property, and, in a word, every demand founded upon intere&s;t; not excepting repara|tion, as will afterward appear. But with re&s;pect to the moral cha|racters of men, and with re&s;pect to rewards and puni&s;hments, a &s;tandard is e&s;tabli&s;hed far le&s;s rigid; which is, the opinion that men form of their own actions: and accordingly, as mentioned a|bove, a man is held to be innocent when he does what he him&s;elf thinks right; and is held to be guilty when he does what he him&s;elf thinks wrong. Thus we are led, by a natural principle, to judge of others as we believe they judge of them&s;elves; and by that rule we pronounce them virtuous or vicious, innocent or guilty; and we approve or di&s;approve, prai&s;e or blame them accordingly <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Virtuous and vicious, innocent and guilty, &s;ignify qualities both of men and of their actions. Approbation and di&s;approbation, prai&s;e and blame, do not &s;ignify qualities; but &s;ignify certain &s;eelings or &s;entiments of tho&s;e who &s;ee or con&s;ider men and their actions.</NOTE>. Some,
<PB N="24" REF="33">
it is true, are &s;o perverted by bad education, or by &s;uper&s;tition, as to e&s;pou&s;e numberle&s;s ab&s;urd tenets, flatly contradicting the common &s;tandard of right and wrong; and yet even the&s;e make no excep|tion from the rule: if they act according to con&s;cience, they are in|nocent, however wrong the action may be; and if they act again&s;t con&s;cience, they are guilty, however right the action may be. Here then is a con&s;picuous &s;tandard for rewards and puni&s;hments: it is a man's own con&s;cience that declares him innocent or guilty, and con&s;equently fit to be rewarded or puni&s;hed; for it is abhorrent to every natural perception, that a guilty per&s;on be rewarded, or an innocent per&s;on puni&s;hed. Further, in order that per&s;onal merit and demerit may not in any mea&s;ure depend upon chance, we are &s;o con|&s;tituted as to place innocence and guilt, not on the event, but on the intention of doing right or wrong; and accordingly, whatever be the event, a man will be prai&s;ed for an action well intended, and con|demned for an action ill intended.</P>
<P>But what if a man intending a wrong, happen by accident to do a wrong he did not intend; as, for example, intending to rob a warren by &s;hooting the rabbits, he accidentally wound a child un&s;een behind a bu&s;h? The delinquent ought to be puni&s;hed for intending to rob; and he is al&s;o &s;ubjected to repair the hurt done to the child: but he cannot be puni&s;hed for this accidental wound; becau&s;e the law of nature regulates puni&s;hment by the intention, and not by the event <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">During the infancy of nations, pecuniary compo&s;itions for crimes obtained univer&s;ally; and during that long period very little weight was laid upon intention. This proceeded from the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and ob&s;curity of moral perceptions, joined with the re&s;emblance of a pecu|niary puni&s;hment to reparation: where a man does mi&s;chief intentionally, or is <HI>ver&s;ans in illicito,</HI> as expre&s;&s;ed in the Roman law, he may ju&s;tly be bound to repair all the harm that en&s;ues, however accidentally; and from the re&s;emblance of pecuniary puni&s;hment to repara|tion, the rule was inadvertently extended to puni&s;hment. But this rule, &s;o gro&s;s, and &s;o little confi&s;tent with moral principles, could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t after pecuniary compo&s;itions gave place to corporal puni&s;hment; and accordingly, among civilized nations, the law of nature was re&s;tored, which prohibits puni&s;hment for any mi&s;chief that is not intentional. The Engli&s;h mu&s;t be excepted&punc; who, remarkably tenacious of their original laws and cu&s;toms, pre&s;erve in force, even as to capital puni&s;hment, the above-mentioned rule that obtained when pecu|niary compo&s;itions were in vigour. The following pa&s;&s;age is from Hale's Pleas of the crown, <HI>ch.</HI> 39. <Q REND="inline">"Regularly he that voluntarily and knowingly intends hurt to the per&s;on of a man&punc; as for example to beat him, though he intend not death; yet if death en&s;ues, it excu&s;eth not from the guilt of murder, or man&s;laughter at lea&s;t, as the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e happen."</Q> And Fo&s;ter, in his Crown-law, though a judicious and accurate writer, lays down the &s;ame doctrine, without even &s;u&s;pecting in it the lea&s;t deviation from moral princi|ples: <Q REND="inline">"A &s;hooteth at the poultry of B, and by accident killeth a man; if his intention was to &s;teal the poultry, which mu&s;t be collected from circum&s;tances, it will be murder&punc; by rea&s;on of that felonious intent; but if it was done wantonly, and without that intention, it will be barely man&s;laughter;"</Q> <HI>p.</HI> 259.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="34">
The tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the primary virtues is attended with &s;evere and never-failing puni&s;hments, which are much more effectual than any that have been invented to inforce municipal laws: on the other hand, there is very little merit a&s;cribed even to the &s;tricte&s;t ob&s;er|vance of them. The &s;econdary virtues are directly oppo&s;ite, with re|&s;pect to their rewards and puni&s;hments: the neglect of them is not attended with any puni&s;hment; but the practice of them is attended with the highe&s;t degree of approbation. Offices of unde&s;erved kindne&s;s, returns of good for evil, generous toils and &s;ufferings for our friends, or for our country, come under this cla&s;s: to perform actions of this kind, there is no motive that, in a proper &s;en&s;e, can be termed a law; but there are the &s;tronge&s;t motives that can con&s;i&s;t with freedom, the per|formance being rewarded with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;elf-merit, and with univer&s;al prai&s;e and admiration, the highe&s;t rewards human na|ture is &s;u&s;ceptible of.</P>
<P>From what is &s;aid, the following ob&s;ervation will occur: The pain of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing ju&s;tice, fidelity, or any primary virtue, is much great|er than the plea&s;ure of performance; but the pain of neglecting a generous action, or any &s;econdary virtue, is as nothing, compared with the plea&s;ure of performance. Among the vices oppo&s;ite to the primary virtues, the mo&s;t &s;triking moral deformity is found: among the &s;econdary virtues, the mo&s;t &s;triking moral beauty.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Reparation.</HEAD>
<P>REPARATION, a capital part of the moral &s;y&s;tem, promotes two ends of great importance: it repre&s;&s;es wrongs that are not cri|minal; and it al&s;o makes up the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by wrongs of what|ever kind. With re&s;pect to the former, reparation is a &s;pecies of pu|ni&s;hment; and with re&s;pect to the latter, it is a branch of ju&s;tice. The&s;e ends will be better under&s;tood, after a&s;certaining the nature and true foundation of reparation. Every claim for reparation &s;up|po&s;es a wrong action done by one, and lo&s;s or mi&s;chief thereby occa|&s;ioned to another: And hence, 1<HI>mo,</HI> There can be no claim for repa|ration
<PB N="26" REF="35">
if the action was innocent, whatever be the mi&s;chief; 2<HI>do,</HI> Nor can there be any claim unle&s;s mi&s;chief have happened, however wrong, or even criminal, the action may be. That the repara|tion to be awarded mu&s;t corre&s;pond to the extent of the lo&s;s or mi&s;|chief, is &s;elf-evident. The &s;ingle difficulty is, to &s;eparate, by pre|ci&s;e boundaries, actions that are wrong from tho&s;e that are innocent. In order to explain the qualities of right and wrong, it was &s;ufficient at fir&s;t to lay down in general, That an action done intentionally to produce an agreeable effect, is right; and done intentionally to pro|duce a di&s;agreeable effect, is wrong. But upon examining this &s;ub|ject more narrowly, certain actions are di&s;covered to be wrong, though the mi&s;chief they have produced was not intended; and certain ac|tions are di&s;covered to be innocent, though they have produced mi&s;|chief. And the&s;e I &s;hall endeavour to explain, as follows.</P>
<P>The moral &s;en&s;e dictates, that in acting we ought carefully to a|void doing mi&s;chief: the only difficulty is, to determine what de|gree of care is requi&s;ite. An action may produce mi&s;chief that was fore&s;een, but not intended; and it may produce mi&s;chief that was neither intended nor fore&s;een. The former is not cri|minal; becau&s;e no action has that character, without an intention to produce mi&s;chief: but it is CULPABLF or FAULTY, becau&s;e the moral &s;en&s;e prohibits every action that may probably do mi&s;chief; and if we do mi&s;chief by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing that prohibition, we are bla|med by others, and even by our&s;elves. Thus, a man who throws a large &s;tone into the market-place among a crowd of people, is high|ly culpable; becau&s;e he fore&s;aw that mi&s;chief would probably en&s;ue, though he had no intention to hurt any per&s;on. With re&s;pect to the latter, though the mi&s;chief was neither intended nor fore&s;een, yet if it <HI>might</HI> have been fore&s;een, the action &s;o far is ra&s;h or incautious, and con&s;equently culpable or faulty in &s;ome degree. Thus, if a man, in pulling down an old hou&s;e adjacent to a frequented place, happen to wound a pa&s;&s;enger, without calling aloud that people may keep out of the way, the action is in &s;ome degree culpable, becau&s;e the mi&s;chief might have been fore&s;een. But though harm en&s;ue, an action is not culpable or faulty, if all rea&s;onable precaution have been adhibited: the moral &s;en&s;e declares the author to be innocent: the effect is per|ceived to be accidental; and the action may be termed <HI>unlucky</HI> or <HI>un|fortunate,</HI> but cannot be &s;aid to be either right or wrong <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Si putator, ex arbore ramum cum dejecerit, vel machinarius, hominem praetereuntem occidit: ita tenetur, &s;i is in publicum decidat, nec ille proclamavit, ut ca&s;us ejus evitari po&s;&s;et.

<P><PB N="27" REF="36">
With re&s;pect to ra&s;h or incautious actions, where the mi&s;chief might have been fore&s;een, though neither intended nor actually fore&s;een, it is not &s;ufficient to e&s;cape blame, that a man naturally ra&s;h or inattentive acts according to his character: a degree of pre|caution is required of him, both by him&s;elf and by others, &s;uch as is natural to the generality of men. The author, in particular, per|ceives, that he might and ought to have acted more cautiou&s;ly; and his con&s;cience reproaches him for his inattention, not le&s;s than if he were naturally more cool and attentive. Thus the circum&s;pection natural to man in general, is applied as a &s;tandard to every indivi|dual; and if they fall &s;hort of that &s;tandard, they are culpable and blameable, however unfore&s;een by them the mi&s;chief may have been. This rule is di&s;tinctly laid down in the Roman law: <Q REND="inline">"Cul|pam autem e&s;&s;e, quod, cum a diligente provideri poterit, non e&s;|&s;et provi&s;um <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 31. ad. leg. Aquil.</NOTE>."</Q> Here the per&s;on's ordinary diligence is not re|ferred to as the &s;tandard, but the ordinary diligence of mankind. Ari&s;totle, in his Rhetoric, has evidently the &s;ame rule in view: <Q REND="inline">"Rea&s;on teacheth us to di&s;tingui&s;h between an injury and a fault, and between a fault and a mere accident. A mere accident can neither be fore&s;een nor prevented: a fault is where the mi&s;chief <HI>might</HI> have been fore&s;een, but where the action was done without evil intention: an injury is that which is done with an evil in|tention."</Q></P>
<P>What is &s;aid upon culpable actions is equally applicable to cul|pable omi&s;&s;ions; for by the&s;e al&s;o mi&s;chief may be occa&s;ioned, inti|tling the &s;ufferer to reparation. If we forbear to do our duty with an intention to occa&s;ion mi&s;chief, the forbearance is criminal. The only nice point is, how far forbearance without &s;uch intention is culpable. If the probability of mi&s;chief was fore&s;een, though not intended, the omi&s;&s;ion is highly culpable; and though neither in|tended nor fore&s;een, yet the omi&s;&s;ion is culpable, in a lower degree, if there have been le&s;s care and attention than are proper for per|forming the duty required. But &s;uppo&s;ing all due care, the omi&s;&s;ion of extreme care and diligence is not culpable.</P>
<P>Upon a&s;certaining what acts and omi&s;&s;ions are culpable or faulty, every intricacy with re&s;pect to reparation vani&s;hes; for it may be laid down as a rule, without an exception, That every culpable act, and every culpable omi&s;&s;ion, binds us in con&s;cience to repair the mi&s;chief
<PB N="28" REF="37">
occa&s;ioned by it. The moral &s;en&s;e binds us no farther; for it loads not with reparation the man who is innocent, though he have done harm: the harm is accidental; and we are &s;o con&s;tituted as not to be re&s;pon&s;ible in con&s;cience for what happens by accident. But here it is requi&s;ite that the man be in every re&s;pect innocent; for if he intend harm of any &s;ort, he will find him&s;elf bound in con&s;cience to repair the harm he has done, even accidentally: as, for example, when aiming a blow unju&s;tly at one in the dark, he happens to wound another whom he did not &s;u&s;pect to be there. And hence it is a rule in all municipal laws, That one <HI>ver&s;ans in illicito</HI> is liable for every con&s;equence. That the&s;e particulars are wi&s;ely ordered by the author of our nature for the good of &s;ociety, will appear after|ward.</P>
<P>We are now prepared for a more particular in&s;pection of the two ends of reparation above mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI> the repre&s;&s;ing wrongs that are not criminal, and the making up what lo&s;s is &s;u&s;tained by wrongs of whatever kind. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, it is clear, that puni&s;h|ment, in its proper &s;en&s;e, cannot be inflicted for a wrong that is cul|pable only; and if nature did not provide &s;ome means for repre&s;&s;ing &s;uch wrongs, &s;ociety would &s;carce be a comfortable &s;tate: without a pecuniary reparation, there would be no compul&s;ion, other than that of con&s;cience merely, to prevent culpable omi&s;&s;ions: and with re&s;pect to culpable commi&s;&s;ions, the nece&s;&s;ity of reparation is &s;till more apparent; for con&s;cience alone, without the &s;anction of reparation, would &s;eldom have authority &s;ufficient to re&s;train us from acting ra&s;h|ly or incautiou&s;ly, even where the po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;chief is fore&s;een, and far le&s;s where it is not fore&s;een.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;econd end of reparation, my con&s;cience dictates to me, that if a man &s;uffer by my fault, whether the mi&s;chief was fore&s;een or not fore&s;een, it is my duty to make up his lo&s;s; and I perceive intuitively, that the lo&s;s ought to re&s;t ultimately upon me, and not upon the &s;ufferer, who has done no wrong.</P>
<P>In every ca&s;e where the mi&s;chief done can be e&s;timated by a pecu|niary compen&s;ation, the two ends of reparation coincide. The &s;um is taken from the one as a &s;ort of puni&s;hment for his fault, and is be&s;towed on the other to relieve him from the lo&s;s he has &s;u&s;tained. But there are numberle&s;s in&s;tances, where the mi&s;chief done admits not an equivalent in money; and in &s;uch in&s;tances, there is no place for reparation except with relation to its fir&s;t end. Defama|tion, contemptuous treatment, per&s;onal re&s;traint, the breaking one's peace of mind, are injuries that cannot be repaired by money; and
<PB N="29" REF="38">
the pecuniary reparation that the wrong-doer is decreed to make, can only be as a &s;ort of puni&s;hment, in order to deter him from a reitera|tion of &s;uch injuries: the &s;um, it is true, is awarded to the per&s;on in|jured; but this cannot be to make up his lo&s;s, which money cannot do, but only as a <HI>&s;olatium</HI> for what he has &s;uffered.</P>
<P>Hitherto it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that the man who intends an ill effect is at the &s;ame time con&s;cious of its being ill. But a man may intend an ill effect, thinking, erroneou&s;ly, that it is good; or a good effect, thinking, erroneou&s;ly, that it is ill: and the que&s;tion is, What &s;hould be the con&s;equence of &s;uch error with re&s;pect to reparation? The latter ca&s;e is clear: if the effect be good, the action that produced it is right, whatever be the author's opinion; and no per&s;on who occa|&s;ionally &s;uffers lo&s;s by a right action is intitled to complain. On the other hand, if the effect be ill, and the action con&s;equently wrong, the innocence of the author, for which he is indebted to an error in judgement, will not relieve him from reparation. When he is made &s;en&s;ible of his error, he perceives him&s;elf bound in con&s;cience to re|pair the harm he has done by a wrong action: and all others, &s;en&s;i|ble from the beginning of his error, perceive that he is &s;o bound; for to them it mu&s;t appear obvious, that a man's errors ought ulti|mately to affect him&s;elf only, and not the per&s;on who has not erred. Hence, in general, reparation always follows wrong or inju&s;tice; and is not in the lea&s;t affected by an erroneous opinion of a right action being wrong, or a wrong action right.</P>
<P>But this doctrine &s;uffers an exception with re&s;pect to a man who, having undertaken a tru&s;t, is bound in duty to act: as where an of|ficer of the revenue, upon a doubtful clau&s;e in a &s;tatute, makes a &s;ei+zure of goods, as forfeited to the crown, which afterward in the proper court are found not to be &s;eizable. The officer, in this ca&s;e, ought not to be &s;ubjected to reparation, if he have acted to the be&s;t of his judgement. This rule, however, mu&s;t be taken with a limita|tion: a gro&s;s error will not excu&s;e a public officer, who ought to know better.</P>
<P>It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that a man is not accountable for any harm he does by an involuntary act. A ma&s;on, for example, tumbling from a &s;caffold, happens in falling to wound one below: his con&s;cience blames him not for what he could not help; and there is nothing in his conduct to lay hold of, for &s;ubjecting him to repara|tion. But it is not &s;ufficient that one of &s;everal connected actions be involuntary; for reparation may be claimed, though the imme|diate act be involuntary, provided it be connected with a preceding
<PB N="30" REF="39">
voluntary act. Example: <Q REND="inline">"If A ride an unruly hor&s;e in Lincolns|inn-fields to tame him, and the hor&s;e breaking from A run over B, and grievou&s;ly hurt him; B &s;hall have an action again&s;t A. For though the mi&s;chief was done again&s;t the will of A, yet &s;ince it was his fault to bring a wild hor&s;e into a frequented place where mi&s;chief might en&s;ue, he mu&s;t an&s;wer for the con&s;equences."</Q> Gaius &s;eems to carry this rule &s;till further, holding in general, that if a hor&s;e, by the weakne&s;s or un&s;kilfulne&s;s of the rider, break away and do mi&s;chief, the rider is liable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 8. &sect; 1. ad. leg. Aquil.</NOTE>. But Gaius probably had in his eye a frequented place, where the mi&s;chief might have been fore&s;een. Thus, in general, a man is made liable for the mi&s;chief occa&s;ioned by his voluntary act, though the immediate cau&s;e of the mi&s;chief be in|voluntary.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. The Laws of Society con&s;idered with re&s;pect to their final cau&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>BY our &s;en&s;es, external and internal, we are made acquainted with objects external and internal, and with their qualities: knowledge &s;o acquired is termed <HI>intuitive,</HI> becau&s;e we acquire more knowledge by &s;ight or intuition than by any other of our &s;en&s;es. The rea&s;oning faculty inve&s;tigates truth by a regular progre&s;s from premi&s;es to con&s;equences; and, upon that account, knowledge &s;o ac|quired may be termed <HI>di&s;cur&s;ive.</HI> Thus certain properties of a tri|angle, and of a &s;quare, are laid open to us by rea&s;oning; and the knowledge we thereby acquire is di&s;cur&s;ive. Of the different degrees of conviction, the very highe&s;t belongs to intuitive knowledge: and it ought to be &s;o, becau&s;e this &s;pecies of knowledge is acquired by perception alone; which is not only a &s;ingle mental act, but is al&s;o complete in it&s;elf, having no dependence on any thing antecedent: whereas di&s;cur&s;ive knowledge requires, not only a plurality of men|tal acts, but al&s;o one or more intuitive propo&s;itions to found upon. We accordingly rely more upon intuitive knowledge than upon the &s;tricte&s;t rea&s;oning: witne&s;s external objects, of who&s;e exi&s;tence we have a more &s;olid conviction than of any propo&s;ition in Euclid. The application of this doctrine to morality, will be obvious at fir&s;t view.
<PB N="31" REF="40">
By perception alone, without rea&s;oning, we acquire the knowledge of right and of wrong, of what we may do, of what we ought to do, and of what we ought to ab&s;tain from: and con&s;idering that we have thus a greater certainty of the moral laws than of any propo&s;ition di&s;covered by rea&s;oning, man may well be deemed the favourite of Heaven, when &s;uch wi&s;dom is employ'd in qualifying him to act a right part in life: the moral &s;en&s;e or con&s;cience may well be held the voice of God within us, con&s;tantly admoni&s;hing us of our duty; and requiring on our part no exerci&s;e of our faculties but attention merely. The celebrated Locke ventured what he thought a bold con|jecture, that the moral duties may be capable of demon&s;tration: how great his &s;urpri&s;e to have been told, that they are capable of much higher evidence!</P>
<P>It would be lo&s;ing time to indicate the final cau&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing morality upon intuitive knowledge. Let us only con&s;ider what mu&s;t have been our condition, had we been left to the glimmering light of rea&s;on. This faculty is di&s;tributed among men in portions &s;o unequal, as to bar all hopes from it of uniformity, either in opinion or in action. Rea&s;on, it is true, aided by experience, may &s;upport morality, by convincing us that we cannot be happy if we abandon our duty for any other intere&s;t: but rea&s;on, even with experience, &s;eldom weighs much again&s;t pa&s;&s;ion; and to re&s;train its impetuo&s;ity, nothing le&s;s is requi&s;ite than the vigorous and commanding principle of duty, directed by the &s;hining light of intuition.</P>
<P>A &s;econd final cau&s;e re&s;pecting al&s;o morality in general, re&s;ults from the connection above mentioned between right and agreeable in human actions, and between wrong and di&s;agreeable. Were our duty di&s;agreeable, man would be an incon&s;i&s;tent being; for his incli|nation would be con&s;tantly in oppo&s;ition to his duty. To mi&s;lead us from our duty, even though agreeable, there are &s;o many temptations, that it is no ea&s;y ta&s;k to keep the &s;traight road: would we per&s;evere in it if our duty were di&s;agreeable?</P>
<P>As the moral duties above mentioned are obviou&s;ly calculated for the good of &s;ociety, it might be thought, that, in&s;tead of particu|lar duties, all &s;hould be reduced to a &s;ingle general rule, that of do|ing every thing in our power for the good of &s;ociety. But I &s;hall endeavour to evince, that this imagined &s;y&s;tem, however plau&s;ible, is neither &s;uited to the end propo&s;ed by it, nor to the nature of man; and in the cour&s;e of the argument it will be &s;een, with what &s;uperior wi&s;dom the true &s;y&s;tem of morality is contrived, which will &s;et its fi|nal cau&s;e in a con&s;picuous light. It has been &s;hown how e&s;&s;ential in|tuitive
<PB N="32" REF="41">
knowledge is to the performance of our duty: and I begin with examining what place there might be for intuitive knowledge in the propo&s;ed &s;y&s;tem. As the general good of mankind re&s;ults from many and various circum&s;tances intricately combined, that good may be a &s;ubject for rea&s;oning, but never can be an object of intuitive knowledge. But rea&s;on employ'd in weighing an endle&s;s number and variety of circum&s;tances, &s;eldom affords any &s;olid conviction; and upon the propo&s;ed &s;y&s;tem we would be often left in the dark about our duty, however upright our intentions might be. At the &s;ame time, we would in vain expect from &s;uch faint conviction, authority &s;ufficient to counterbalance the influence of pa&s;&s;ion: our duty would vani&s;h from our &s;ight in a maze of &s;ubtilties; and &s;elf-partiality would always &s;ugge&s;t plau&s;ible rea&s;ons, for &s;light tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions at fir&s;t, and afterward for the very bolde&s;t. It is therefore order|ed with con&s;ummate wi&s;dom, even for the general good, that, a|voiding general and complex objects, the moral &s;en&s;e &s;hould be di|rected to certain particular acts, and their effects; which, being plain and &s;imple, can be made our duty by intuitive perception.</P>
<P>In the next place, to make univer&s;al benevolence our duty, with|out di&s;tinction of per&s;ons or circum&s;tances, would in effect &s;ubject us to the ab&s;urd and impracticable duty, of &s;erving at the &s;ame in&s;tant an endle&s;s number and variety of per&s;ons; which, in&s;tead of promo|ting the general good, would evidently be detrimental, by unquali|fying us to perform any part.</P>
<P>The true &s;y&s;tem of morality, that which is di&s;play'd above, is bet|ter &s;uited to the limited powers of man; and yet is contrived in the mo&s;t perfect manner for promoting the general good. There is no occa&s;ion to lo&s;e time in demon&s;trating, that a man entirely &s;elfi&s;h is ill fitted for &s;ociety; and we have &s;een, that univer&s;al benevolence, con&s;idered as a duty, would contribute to the general good perhaps le&s;s than ab&s;olute &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. Man is much better fitted for &s;o|ciety, by having in his con&s;titution the principles of &s;elf-love and of benevolence duly proportioned. Benevolence, as far as a du|ty, takes place of &s;elf-love; which is wi&s;ely ordered, becau&s;e &s;o far it is e&s;&s;ential to the very con&s;titution of &s;ociety. Benevolence, again, as a virtue not a duty, gives place to &s;elf-love; which is ordered with equal wi&s;dom, becau&s;e every man has more power, knowledge, and opportunity, to promote his own good, than that of others: by which means more good is actually produced, than if we were entirely &s;urrendered to benevolence. At the &s;ame time, the princi|ple of benevolence is as exten&s;ive as can con&s;i&s;t with the limited capa|city
<PB N="33" REF="42">
of man: the chief objects of his affection are his relations, his friends, his benefactors, to &s;erve whom he is bound in duty: &s;ome &s;hare of benevolence is re&s;erved for his neighbours, and even for tho&s;e he is barely acquainted with; and to make benevolence more exten&s;ive, would be entirely fruitle&s;s, becau&s;e here are objects in plen|ty to fill the mo&s;t capacious mind. But though there is not room for a greater variety of particular objects, yet the faculty we have of u|niting numberle&s;s individuals into one complex object, enlarges great|ly the &s;phere of our benevolence: for by this power, our country, our religion, our con&s;titution, become objects of the mo&s;t vigorous affection and public &s;pirit. The individuals that compo&s;e the group, con&s;idered apart, may be too minute, or too di&s;tant, for our benevolence; but when comprehended under one view, they become a complex object that warms and dilates the heart. By that won|derful faculty, the limited capacity of our nature is remedied; di|&s;tant objects, otherwi&s;e invi&s;ible, are rendered con&s;picuous; accumu|lation makes them great; greatne&s;s brings them near the eye; and affection, pre&s;erved entire, is be&s;tow'd upon a complex object, as up|on one that is &s;ingle and vi&s;ible; but with much greater force in pro|portion to its &s;uperior importance.</P>
<P>We now proceed to particulars; and the fir&s;t that meets us is the great law of re&s;traint. Man is evidently framed for &s;ociety; and be|cau&s;e there can be no &s;ociety among creatures who prey upon each o|ther, it was nece&s;&s;ary, in the fir&s;t place, to provide again&s;t mutual in|juries; which is effectually done by this law. Its nece&s;&s;ity with re|&s;pect to per&s;onal &s;ecurity is &s;elf-evident; and its nece&s;&s;ity with re&s;pect to matters of property, will be evident from what follows. There is in the nature of man a propen&s;ity to hoard or &s;tore up the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; a propen&s;ity e&s;&s;ential to our well-being, by prompt|ing us to provide for our&s;elves, and for tho&s;e who depend on us. But this natural propen&s;ity would be rendered ineffectual, were we not &s;ecured in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what we thus &s;tore up; for a man will never toil to accumulate what he cannot &s;ecurely po&s;&s;e&s;s. This &s;ecurity is afforded by the moral &s;en&s;e; which dictates to all men, that goods &s;tored up by individuals are their <HI>property,</HI> and that pro|perty ought to be inviolable. Thus, by the great law of re&s;traint, men have a protection for their goods, as well as for their per&s;ons or repu|tation; and have not le&s;s &s;ecurity in &s;ociety than if they were &s;epara|ted from each other by impregnable fortre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>If the law of re&s;traint be e&s;&s;ential to the exi&s;tence of &s;ociety, &s;eve|ral other duties are not le&s;s &s;o. Mutual tru&s;t and confidence, with|out
<PB N="34" REF="43">
which there can be no &s;ociety, enter into the character of the human &s;pecies; corre&s;ponding to which are the duties of veracity and fidelity: the latter would be of no &s;ignificancy without the former; and the former without the latter would be hurtful, by laying men open to fraud and deceit.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to veracity, in particular, &s;uch is our &s;ituation in this world, as to be indebted to the information of others for almo&s;t every thing that can benefit or hurt us; and if we could not depend up|on information, &s;ociety would be very little beneficial. Further, it is wi&s;ely ordered, that we &s;hould adhere &s;trictly to truth, even where we perceive no harm in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing that duty; for it is &s;ufficient that harm may po&s;&s;ibly en&s;ue, though not fore&s;een. At the &s;ame time, fal&s;ehood always does mi&s;chief; for if it happen not to injure us externally in our reputation, or in our goods, it never fails to in|jure us internally; which will thus appear. Men were made for &s;o|ciety; and one great ble&s;&s;ing of that &s;tate is a candid intercour&s;e of hearts in conver&s;ation, in communication of &s;entiments, of opinions, of de&s;ires, and of wi&s;hes; and to admit any fal&s;ehood or deceit into &s;uch intercour&s;e, would poi&s;on the mo&s;t refined plea&s;ures of life.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e man is the weake&s;t of all animals &s;eparately, and the very &s;tronge&s;t in &s;ociety, mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance is one great end in the &s;ocial &s;tate; to which end it is nece&s;&s;ary that covenants and promi&s;es be binding, and that favours received be thankfully repaid.</P>
<P>The final cau&s;e of the law of propriety, which inforces the duty we owe to our&s;elves, comes next in order. In a di&s;cour&s;e upon tho&s;e laws of nature which concern &s;ociety, we have no occa&s;ion to men|tion any &s;elf-duty but what is connected with &s;ociety; &s;uch as pru|dence, temperance, indu&s;try, firmne&s;s of mind, &amp;c. And that the&s;e &s;hould be made our duty, is wi&s;ely ordered in a double re&s;pect; fir&s;t as qualifying us to act our part in &s;ociety; and next as intitling us to the good will of others. It is the intere&s;t, no doubt, of every man to &s;uit his behaviour to the dignity of his nature, and to the &s;tation allotted him by Providence; for &s;uch rational conduct contributes to happine&s;s, by pre&s;erving health, by procuring plenty, by gaining the e&s;teem of others, and, which of all is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, by gaining a ju&s;tly founded &s;elf-e&s;teem. But here even &s;elf-intere&s;t is not relied on: the powerful authority of duty is &s;uperadded to the motive of intere&s;t, that in a matter of the utmo&s;t importance both to our&s;elves and to the &s;ociety we live in, our conduct may be &s;teady and regular. The&s;e duties tend not only to make a man happy in
<PB N="35" REF="44">
him&s;elf, but al&s;o, by gaining the good-will and e&s;teem of others, to command their help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in time of need.</P>
<P>I proceed to the final cau&s;es of natural rewards and puni&s;hments. And what at fir&s;t will occur to every one is, that right and wrong ought to be the rule for di&s;tributing rewards and puni&s;hments, as well as for determining civil claims; for does it not &s;eem rational that a right action &s;hould be rewarded, and a wrong action puni&s;h|ed? But, upon more mature reflection, we are forc'd to abandon that opinion. All civil claims, and all controver&s;ies about things, mu&s;t be adju&s;ted by the &s;tandard of right and wrong; for where parties differ about <HI>meum et tuum,</HI> the plaintiff's opinion cannot be the rule, and as little the defendant's: there mu&s;t be an appeal to a judge; and what rule has a judge for determining the controver&s;y, o|ther than the common &s;en&s;e of mankind about right and wrong? But to bring rewards and puni&s;hments under the &s;ame &s;tandard, without regarding private con&s;cience, would be a &s;y&s;tem unworthy of our maker; it being extremely clear, that to reward one who is not con|&s;cious of merit, or to puni&s;h one who is not con&s;cious of guilt, can never an&s;wer any good end; and, in particular, cannot tend either to improvement, or reformation of manners. How much more like the Deity is the plan of nature; which rewards no man who is not con&s;cious that he ought to be rewarded, and puni&s;hes no man who is not con&s;cious that he ought to be puni&s;hed! By the&s;e means, and by the&s;e only, rewards and puni&s;hments attain every good end that can be propo&s;ed by them. Here is a final cau&s;e mo&s;t illu|&s;trious!</P>
<P>The rewards and puni&s;hments that attend the primary and &s;econ|dary virtues, are finely adju&s;ted for &s;upporting the di&s;tinction be|tween them &s;et forth above. Puni&s;hment mu&s;t be confined to the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of primary virtues, it being the intention of nature that the &s;econdary virtues &s;hould be entirely voluntary. On the other hand, the &s;econdary virtues are more highly rewarded than the pri|mary: genero&s;ity, for example, makes a greater figure than ju&s;tice; and undaunted courage, magnanimity, heroi&s;m, ri&s;e &s;till higher in our e&s;teem. One would imagine at fir&s;t view, that the primary vir|tues, being more e&s;&s;ential, &s;hould be intitled to the fir&s;t place in our e&s;teem, and be more amply rewarded than the &s;econdary; and yet nature, in elevating the latter above the former, hath taken her mea|&s;ures with peculiar wi&s;dom and fore&s;ight. Puni&s;hment is re&s;erved to inforce the primary virtues; and if the&s;e virtues were al&s;o accompa|nied with the higher rewards, the &s;econdary virtues, brought down
<PB N="36" REF="45">
to a lower rank, would lo&s;e entirely that warm enthu&s;ia&s;tic admira|tion which is their chief &s;upport: &s;elf-intere&s;t would univer&s;ally pre|vail over benevolence, and &s;ap the very foundation of tho&s;e number|le&s;s favours we receive from each other in &s;ociety; favours, not only beneficial in point of intere&s;t, but a &s;olid foundation for affection and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>In our progre&s;s through final cau&s;es, we come at la&s;t to reparation, one of the principles de&s;tined by Providence, for redre&s;&s;ing wrongs committed, and for preventing the reiteration of them. The final cau&s;e of the principle of reparation, when the mi&s;chief ari&s;es from intention, is &s;elf-evident: for, to afford &s;ecurity to individuals in &s;o|ciety, it is not &s;ufficient that the man who does intentional mi&s;chief be puni&s;hed; it is nece&s;&s;ary that he al&s;o be bound to repair the mi&s;|chief. Secondly, Where the act is wrong or unju&s;t, though not un|der&s;tood by the author to be &s;o, it is wi&s;ely ordered that reparation &s;hould follow; and, in general, that no error, whether in law or in fact, &s;hould avail again&s;t this claim; which will thus appear. Con|&s;idering the fallibility of man, it would be too &s;evere to permit ad|vantage to be taken of error in every ca&s;e. On the other hand, to make it a law in our nature, never to take advantage of error in any ca&s;e, would be giving too much indulgence to indolence and remi&s;|&s;ion of mind, tending to make us neglect the improvement of our rational faculties. Our nature is &s;o happily framed as to avoid the&s;e extremes, by di&s;tingui&s;hing between gain and lo&s;s. No man is con|&s;cious of wrong, when he takes advantage of an error committed by another to &s;ave him&s;elf from lo&s;s: if there mu&s;t be a lo&s;s, common &s;en&s;e dictates, that it ought to re&s;t upon the per&s;on who has err|ed, however innocently, rather than upon him who has not erred. Thus, in a competition among creditors about the e&s;tate of their bankrupt debtor, every one is at liberty to avail him&s;elf of even the &s;lighte&s;t defects in the titles of his competitors, in order to &s;ave him|&s;elf from lo&s;s. But, <HI>in lucro captando,</HI> the moral &s;en&s;e teacheth a dif|ferent le&s;&s;on; which is, that no man ought to take advantage of another's error to make gain by it. Thus, an heir finding a brute diamond in the repo&s;itories of his ance&s;tor, &s;ells the &s;ame for a trifle, mi&s;taking it for a common pebble: the purcha&s;er is, in con&s;cience and in equity, bound to re&s;tore the &s;ame, or to pay a ju&s;t price. Third|ly, The following con&s;iderations tend to unfold a final cau&s;e, not le&s;s beautiful than the foregoing, of what the moral &s;en&s;e dictates with re&s;pect to mi&s;chief done without intention. Society could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t in any tolerable manner, were full &s;cope given to ra&s;hne&s;s and negli|gence,
<PB N="37" REF="46">
and to every action that is not &s;trictly criminal: whence it is a maxim, founded not le&s;s upon utility than upon ju&s;tice, That men living in &s;ociety ought to be extremely circum&s;pect as to every action that may po&s;&s;ibly do harm. On the other hand, it is al&s;o a maxim, That as the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of man depend on ac|tion, activity ought to be encouraged, in&s;tead of being di&s;couraged by the dread of con&s;equences. The&s;e maxims, &s;eemingly in op|po&s;ition, have natural limits that prevent their incroaching upon each other; which limits, at the &s;ame time, produce the mo&s;t good to &s;ociety of all that can be contrived by the mo&s;t con|&s;ummate lawgiver. There is a certain degree of attention and circum&s;pection that men generally be&s;tow upon affairs, propor|tioned to their importance: if that degree were not &s;ufficient to defend again&s;t a claim of reparation, individuals would be too much cramped in action; which would lead to indolence in&s;tead of activity: if a le&s;s degree were &s;ufficient, there would be too great &s;cope for ra&s;h or remi&s;s conduct; which would prove the bane of &s;ociety. The&s;e remarks concerning the good of &s;ociety, coincide en|tirely with what the moral &s;en&s;e dictates, as above mentioned, that the man who acts with fore&s;ight of the probability of mi&s;chief, or acts ra&s;hly and incautiou&s;ly without &s;uch fore&s;ight, ought to be liable for the con&s;equences; but that the man who acts cautiou&s;ly, without fore|&s;eeing or &s;u&s;pecting that any mi&s;chief will en&s;ue, and who therefore is entirely innocent, ought not to be liable for the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>And upon this &s;ubject I add the final cau&s;e of what is explained a|bove, <HI>viz.</HI> That the moral &s;en&s;e requires from every man, not his own degree of vigilance and attention, which may be very &s;mall, but that which belongs to the common nature of the &s;pecies. That this is a wi&s;e regulation, will appear upon con&s;idering, that were repara|tion to depend upon per&s;onal circum&s;tances, there would be a nece&s;&s;i|ty of inquiring into the characters of men, their education, their man|ner of living, and the extent of their under&s;tanding; which would ren|der judges arbitrary, and &s;uch law-&s;uits inextricable. But by a&s;&s;uming the common nature of the &s;pecies as a &s;tandard, by which every man in con&s;cience judges of his own actions, law-&s;uits about reparation are rendered ea&s;y and expeditious.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>EQUITY, &s;carce known to our forefathers, makes at pre&s;ent a great figure: like a plant gradually tending to maturity, it has for ages been increa&s;ing in bulk, &s;lowly indeed but con|&s;tantly; and at what di&s;tance of time we are to hope for its ma|turity, is perhaps not ea&s;y to foretell. Courts of equity have al|ready acquired &s;uch an extent of juri&s;diction, as to ob&s;cure in a great mea&s;ure that of the courts of law. A revolution &s;o &s;ignal, will move every curious inquirer to attempt, or to wi&s;h at lea&s;t, a di&s;covery of the cau&s;e. But vain will be the attempt, till fir&s;t a clear idea be formed of the difference between law and equity. The former we know deals in preci&s;e rules: but does the latter re&s;t on con&s;cience &s;olely without any rule? This would be un&s;afe while men are judges, liable not le&s;s to partiality than to error: nor could a court, without rules, ever have attained that height of favour, and extent of juri&s;diction, which courts of equity enjoy. But if a court of e|quity be governed by any rules or principles, why are not the&s;e brought to light in a &s;y&s;tem? One would imagine, that &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem &s;hould not be u&s;eful only, but ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and yet writers, far from aiming at a &s;y&s;tem, have not even defined with any accu|racy what equity is, nor what are its limits and extent. One opera|tion of equity, univer&s;ally acknowledged, is, to remedy imperfections in the common law, which &s;ometimes is defective, and &s;ometimes ex|ceeds ju&s;t bounds; and as equity is con&s;tantly oppo&s;ed to common law, a ju&s;t idea of the latter may probably lead to the former. In order to a&s;certain what is meant by common law, a hi&s;torical de|duction is nece&s;&s;ary; which I the more chearfully undertake, be|cau&s;e this &s;ubject &s;eems not to be put in a clear light by any writer.</P>
<P>After &s;tates were formed and government e&s;tabli&s;hed, courts of law were invented to compel individuals to do their duty. This in|novation, as generally happens, was at fir&s;t confined within narrow bounds. To the&s;e courts was given power to inforce duties e&s;&s;en|tial to the exi&s;tence of &s;ociety; &s;uch as that of forbearing to do harm or mi&s;chief: power was al&s;o given to inforce duties derived from co|venants and promi&s;es, &s;uch of them at lea&s;t as tend more peculiarly to the well-being of &s;ociety: which was an improvement &s;o great as to leave no thought of proceeding farther; for to extend the protec|tion of a court to natural duties of every &s;ort, would, in a new ex|periment,
<PB N="39" REF="48">
have been reckoned too bold. Thus, in the Roman law, we find many pactions left upon con&s;cience, without receiving any aid from their courts of law: buying and &s;elling only, with a few o|ther covenants e&s;&s;ential to commercial dealing, were regarded. Our courts of law in Britain were originally confined within &s;till narrower bounds: no covenant whatever was by our forefathers countenanced with an action: a contract of buying and &s;elling was not <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reg. Maj. lib. 3. cap. 10. Fleta, lib. 2. cap. 58. &sect; 3, and 5.</NOTE>; and as buying and &s;elling is of all covenants the mo&s;t u&s;eful in common life, we are not at liberty to &s;uppo&s;e that any other was more privi|ledged <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But when the great advantages of a court of law were experien|ced, its juri&s;diction was gradually extended, with univer&s;al approba|tion: it was extended, with very few exceptions, to every covenant and every promi&s;e: it was extended al&s;o to other matters, till it em|braced every obvious duty ari&s;ing in common and ordinary dealings between man and man. But it was extended no farther; experience having di&s;covered limits, beyond which it was deemed hazardous to &s;tretch this juri&s;diction. Cau&s;es of an extraordinary nature, re|quiring &s;ome &s;ingular remedy, could not be &s;afely tru&s;ted with the ordinary courts, becau&s;e no rules were e&s;tabli&s;hed to direct their pro|ceedings in &s;uch matters; and upon that account, &s;uch cau&s;es were appropriated to the king and council, being the paramount court <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">We find the &s;ame regulation among the Jews: <Q REND="inline">"And Mo&s;es cho&s;e able men out of all I&s;rael, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thou&s;ands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. And they judged the people at all &s;ea&s;ons: the hard cau&s;es they brought unto Mo&s;es, but every &s;mall matter they judged them&s;elves;"</Q> <BIBL><HI>Exodus</HI> xviii. 25. 26.</BIBL></NOTE>. Of this nature were actions for proving the tenor or contents of a lo&s;t writ; extraordinary removings again&s;t tenants po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing by lea&s;e; the cau&s;es of pupils, orphans, and foreigners; complaints again&s;t judges and officers of law <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See act 105. parl. 1487.</NOTE>, and the more atrocious crimes, termed, <HI>the pleas of the crown.</HI> Such extraordinary ca&s;es, multiplying great|ly by complex and intricate connections among individuals, daily di&s;covered, became a burden too great for the king and council. In order therefore to relieve this court, extraordinary cau&s;es of a civil nature, were in England devolved upon the court of chancery; a mea&s;ure the more nece&s;&s;ary, that the king, occupied with the mo|mentous affairs of government, and with foreign as well as dome&s;tic tran&s;actions, had not lei&s;ure for private cau&s;es. In Scotland, more
<PB N="40" REF="49">
remote, and therefore le&s;s intere&s;ted in foreign affairs, there was not the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity for this innovation: our kings, however, addicted more to action than to contemplation, neglected in a great mea&s;ure their privilege of being judges, and &s;uffered cau&s;es peculiar to the king and council to be gradually a&s;&s;umed by other &s;overeign courts. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of the court of chancery in England, made it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give a name to the more ordinary branch of law that is the province of the common or ordinary courts: it is termed, <HI>the Common Law:</HI> and in oppo&s;ition to it, the extraordinary branch devolved on the court of chancery is termed <HI>Equity;</HI> the name being derived from the nature of the juri&s;diction, directed le&s;s by preci&s;e rules, than <HI>&s;e|cundum aequum et bonum,</HI> or according to what the judge in con&s;cience thinks right <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">At curiae &s;unto et juri&s;dictiones, quae &s;tatuant ex arbitrio boni viri et di&s;cretione &s;ana, ubi legis norma deficit. Lex enim non &s;ufficit ca&s;ibus, &s;ed ad ea quae plerumque accidunt ap|tatur: &s;apienti&s;&s;ima autem res tempus, (ut ab antiquis dictum e&s;t), et novorum ca&s;uum quo|tidie author et inventor. <BIBL>Bacon de Aug. Scien. lib. <HI>8.</HI> cap. <HI>3.</HI> aphor. <HI>32.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. Thus equity, in its proper &s;en&s;e, comprehends e|very matter of law that by the common law is left without remedy; and &s;uppo&s;ing the boundaries of the common law to be a&s;certained, there can no longer remain any difficulty about the powers of a court of equity. But as the&s;e boundaries are not a&s;certained by any natural principle, the juri&s;diction of common law mu&s;t depend in a great mea&s;ure upon accident and arbitrary practice; and accordingly the boundaries of common law and equity, vary in different countries, and at different times in the &s;ame country. We have &s;een, that the common law of Britain was originally not &s;o exten&s;ive as at pre&s;ent; and in&s;tances will be mentioned afterward, which evince, that the common law in Scotland is farther extended than in England. Its li|mits are perhaps not accurately a&s;certained in any country; which is to be regretted, becau&s;e of the uncertainty that mu&s;t follow in the prac|tice of law. It is lucky, however, that the di&s;ea&s;e is not incurable: a good under&s;tanding between the judges of the different courts, with ju&s;t notions of law, may, in time, a&s;certain the&s;e limits with &s;ufficient accuracy.</P>
<P>Among a plain people, &s;trangers to refinement and &s;ubtilties, law|&s;uits may be frequent, but never are intricate. Regulations to re|&s;train individuals from doing mi&s;chief, and to inforce performance of covenants, compo&s;ed originally the bulk of the common law; and the&s;e two branches, among our rude ance&s;tors, &s;eemed to compre|hend every &s;ubject of law. The more refined duties of morality were,
<PB N="41" REF="50">
in that early period, little felt, and le&s;s regarded. But law, in this &s;imple form, cannot long continue &s;tationary: for in the &s;ocial &s;tate under regular di&s;cipline, law ripens gradually with the human facul|ties; and by ripene&s;s of di&s;cernment, and delicacy of &s;entiment, ma|ny duties, formerly neglected, are found to be binding in con&s;cience. Such duties can no longer be neglected by courts of ju&s;tice; and as they made no part of the common law, they come naturally under the juri&s;diction of a court of equity.</P>
<P>The chief objects of benevolence con&s;idered as a duty, are our re|lations, our benefactors, our ma&s;ters, our &s;ervants, &amp;c.; and the&s;e duties, or the mo&s;t obvious of them, come under the cogni&s;ance of common law. But there are other connections which, though more tran&s;itory, produce a &s;en&s;e of duty. Two per&s;ons &s;hut up in the &s;ame pri&s;on, perhaps for different cau&s;es, being no way connected but by contiguity, and re&s;emblance of condition, are &s;en&s;ible, howe|ver, that to aid and comfort each other is a duty incumbent on them. Two per&s;ons &s;hipwrecked upon the &s;ame de&s;ert i&s;land, are &s;en&s;ible of the like mutual duty. And there is even &s;ome &s;en&s;e of this kind, a|mong a number of per&s;ons in the &s;ame &s;hip, or under the &s;ame mili|tary command.</P>
<P>Thus mutual duties among individuals multiply by variety of con|nections; and in the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, benevolence becomes a mat|ter of con&s;cience in a thou&s;and in&s;tances which formerly were altoge|ther di&s;regarded. The duties that ari&s;e from connections &s;o &s;lender, are taken under the juri&s;diction of a court of equity; which at fir&s;t exerci&s;eth its juri&s;diction with great re&s;erve, interpo&s;ing in remark|able ca&s;es only, where the duty is palpable. But, gathering cou|rage from &s;ucce&s;s, it ventures to inforce this duty in more delicate circum&s;tances: one ca&s;e throws light upon another: men, by the rea&s;oning of the judges, become gradually more acute in di&s;cerning their duty: the judges become more and more acute in di&s;tingui&s;h|ing ca&s;es; and this branch of law is imperceptibly moulded into a &s;y&s;tem <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">At curiae illae uni viro ne committantur, &s;ed ex pluribus con&s;tent. Nec decreta exeant cum &s;ilentio: &s;ed judices &s;ententiae &s;uae rationes adducant, idque palam, atque ad&s;tante co|rona; ut quod ip&s;a pote&s;tate &s;it liberum, fama tamen et exi&s;timatione &s;it circum&s;criptum. <BIBL>Bacon de Aug. Scient. lib. <HI>8.</HI> cap. <HI>3.</HI> aphor. <HI>38.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. In rude ages, acts of benevolence, however peculiar the connection may be, are but faintly perceived to be our duty: &s;uch perceptions become gradually more firm and clear by cu&s;tom and re|flection;
<PB N="42" REF="51">
and when men are &s;o far enlightened, it is the duty as well as honour of judges to interpo&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See E&s;&s;ays on morality and natural religion, &s;econd edition, p. 108.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This branch of equitable juri&s;diction &s;hall be illu&s;trated by va|rious examples. When goods by labour, and perhaps with danger, are recovered from the &s;ea after a &s;hipwreck, every one perceives it to be the duty of the proprietor to pay &s;alvage. A man ventures his life to &s;ave a hou&s;e from fire, and is &s;ucce&s;sful; no mortal can doubt that he is intitled to a recompence from the proprietor, who is bene|fited. If a man's affairs by his ab&s;ence be in di&s;order, is not the friend who undertakes the management, intitled to a recompence, though the &s;ubject upon which his money was u&s;efully be&s;towed may have afterward peri&s;hed ca&s;ually? Who can doubt of the following propo&s;ition, That I am in the wrong to demand money from my debtor, while I with-hold the &s;um I owe him, which perhaps may be his only re&s;ource for doing me ju&s;tice? Such a proceeding mu&s;t, in the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, appear partial and oppre&s;&s;ive. By the common law, however, no remedy is afforded in this ca&s;e, nor in the others mentioned. But equity affords a remedy, by inforcing what in &s;uch circum&s;tances every man perceives to be his duty. I &s;hall add but one example more: In a violent &s;torm, the heavie&s;t goods are thrown overboard, in order to di&s;burden the &s;hip: the pro|prietors of the goods pre&s;erved by this means from the &s;ea, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that it is their duty to repair the lo&s;s; for the man who has thus abandoned his goods for the common &s;afety, ought to be in no wor&s;e condition than them&s;elves. Equity dictates this to be their du|ty; and if they be refractory, a court of equity will interpo&s;e in be|half of the &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>It appears now clearly, that a court of equity commences at the limits of the common law, and in certain circum&s;tances neglected by common law, enforces benevolence where the law of nature makes it our duty. And thus a court of equity, accompanying the law of nature in its gradual refinements, enforces every natural duty that is not provided for by common law.</P>
<P>The duties hitherto mentioned ari&s;e from connections independent altogether of con&s;ent. Covenants and promi&s;es al&s;o, are the &s;ource of various connections, and of various duties. The mo&s;t obvious of the&s;e duties, being commonly declared in words, belong to the com|mon law. But every incident that can po&s;&s;ibly occur in fulfilling a covenant, is &s;eldom fore&s;een; and yet a court of common law, in giving judgment upon covenants, con&s;iders nothing but declared will,
<PB N="43" REF="52">
neglecting incidents that would have been provided for had they been fore&s;een. Further, the inductive motive for making a covenant, and its ultimate purpo&s;e and intendment, are circum&s;tances di&s;re|garded at common law: the&s;e, however, are capital circum&s;tances; and ju&s;tice, where they are neglected, cannot be fulfilled. Hence the powers of a court of equity with re&s;pect to engagements. It &s;upplies imperfections in common law, by taking under con&s;ideration every material circum&s;tance, in order that ju&s;tice may be di&s;tributed in the mo&s;t perfect manner. It &s;ometimes &s;upplies a defect in words, where will is evidently more exten&s;ive; and &s;ometimes &s;upplies a defect even in will, according to what probably would have been the will of the parties had they fore&s;een the event. By taking &s;uch liberty, a covenant is made effectual according to the aim and purpo&s;e of the contracters; and without &s;uch liberty, &s;eldom it happens that ju&s;tice can be accurately di&s;tributed.</P>
<P>In handling this branch of the &s;ubject, it is not ea&s;y to &s;uppre&s;s a thought that comes cro&s;s the mind. The juri&s;diction of a court of common law, with re&s;pect to covenants, appears to me odd and unaccountable. To find the juri&s;diction of this court limited, as a|bove mentioned, to certain duties of the law of nature, without com|prehending the whole, is not &s;ingular nor &s;urpri&s;ing. But with re|&s;pect to the circum&s;tances that occur in the &s;ame cau&s;e, it cannot fail to appear &s;ingular, that a court &s;hould be confined to a few of the&s;e circum&s;tances, neglecting others not le&s;s material in point of ju&s;tice. This reflection will be &s;et in a clear light by a &s;ingle example. Every one knows, that an Engli&s;h double bond was a contrivance to evade the old law of this i&s;land, which prohibited the taking intere&s;t for money: the profe&s;&s;ed purpo&s;e of this bond is, to provide for inter|e&s;t and co&s;ts; beyond which the penal part ought not to be exacted: and yet a court of common law, confined &s;trictly to the words or de|clared will, is nece&s;&s;itated knowingly to commit inju&s;tice. The mo|ment the term of payment is pa&s;t, when there cannot be either co&s;ts or intere&s;t, this court, in&s;tead of pronouncing &s;entence for what is really due, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;um borrowed, mu&s;t follow the words of the bond, and give judgement for the double. This defect in the con&s;ti|tution of a court, is too remarkable to have been overlooked: a remedy accordingly is provided, though far from being of the mo&s;t perfect kind; and that is, a privilege to apply to the court of equity for re|dre&s;s. Far better had it been, either to withdraw covenants altoge|ther from the common law, or to impower the judges of that law
<PB N="44" REF="53">
to determine according to the principles of ju&s;tice <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">And accordingly, by 4^o Annae, cap. 16. &sect; 13. the defendant, pending action on a double bond, offering payment of principal, intere&s;t, and co&s;ts, &s;hall be di&s;charged by the court.</NOTE>. I need &s;carce ob&s;erve, that the pre&s;ent reflection regards England only, where equi|ty and common law are appropriated to different courts. In Scot|land, and other countries where both belong to the &s;ame court, the inconvenience mentioned cannot happen. But to return to the gra|dual exten&s;ion of equity, which is our pre&s;ent theme:</P>
<P>A court of equity, by long and various practice, finding its own &s;trength and utility, and impelled by the principle of ju&s;tice, bold|ly undertakes a matter &s;till more arduous; and that is, to correct or mitigate the rigour, and what even in a proper &s;en&s;e may be termed the <HI>inju&s;tice of common law.</HI> It is not in human fore&s;ight to e&s;tabli&s;h any general rule, that, however &s;alutary in the main, may not be op|pre&s;&s;ive and unju&s;t when applied to &s;ome &s;ingular ca&s;es. Every work of man mu&s;t partake of the imperfection of its author; &s;ometimes falling &s;hort of its purpo&s;e, and &s;ometimes going beyond it. If, with re&s;pect to the former, a court of equity be u&s;eful, it may be pronounced nece&s;&s;ary with re&s;pect to the latter; for, in &s;ociety, it is certainly a greater object to prevent legal oppre&s;&s;ion, which alarms every individual, than to &s;upply legal defects, &s;carce regarded but by tho&s;e immediately concerned. The illu&s;trious Bacon, upon this &s;ub|ject, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with great propriety: <Q REND="inline">"Habeant curiae prae|toriae pote&s;tatem tam &s;ubveniendi contra rigorem legis, quam &s;up|plendi defectum legis. Si enim porrigi debet remedium ei quem lex praeteriit, multo magis ei quem vulneravit <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Aug. Scient. lib. 8. cap. 3. aph. 35.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>All the variety of matter hitherto mentioned, is regulated by the principle of ju&s;tice &s;olely. It may, at fir&s;t view, be thought, that this takes in the whole compa&s;s of law, and that there is no remain|ing field to be occupied by a court of equity. But, upon more narrow in&s;pection, we find a number of law-ca&s;es into which ju|&s;tice enters not, but only the principle of utility. Expediency re|quires that the&s;e be brought under the cogni&s;ance of a court; and the court of equity, gaining daily more weight and authori|ty, takes naturally &s;uch matters under its juri&s;diction. I &s;hall give a few examples. A lavi&s;h man &s;ubmits to have his &s;on made his interdictor: this agreement is not unju&s;t; but tending to the corruption of manners, by rever&s;ing the order of nature, it is reproba|ted by a court of equity, as <HI>contra bonos mores.</HI> This court goes far|ther:
<PB N="45" REF="54">
it di&s;countenances many things in them&s;elves indifferent, mere|ly becau&s;e of their bad tendency. A <HI>pactum de quota litis</HI> is in it&s;elf innocent, and may be beneficial to the client as well as to the advocate: but to remove the temptation from advocates to take advantage of their clients, in&s;tead of &s;erving them faithfully, this court declares again&s;t &s;uch pactions. A court of equity goes &s;till farther, by con&s;ulting the public intere&s;t with relation to mat|ters not otherwi&s;e bad but by occa&s;ioning unnece&s;&s;ary trouble and vexation to individuals. Hence the origin of regulations tending to abridge law-&s;uits.</P>
<P>A mi&s;chief that affects the whole community figures in the ima|gination, and will naturally move judges to &s;tretch out a preventive hand. But what &s;hall we &s;ay of a mi&s;chief that affects one per&s;on only, or but a few? An e&s;tate, for example, real or per&s;onal, is left entirely without management, by the infancy of the proprietor, or by his ab&s;ence in a remote country: he has no friends, or they are unwilling to interpo&s;e. It is natural, in this ca&s;e, to apply for pu|blic authority. A court of common law, confined within certain preci&s;e limits, can give no aid; and therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary that a court of equity &s;hould undertake ca&s;es of this kind; and the pre|ventive remedy is ea&s;y, by naming an admini&s;trator, or, as termed in the Roman law, <HI>curator bonorum.</HI> A &s;imilar example is, where a court of equity gives authority to &s;ell the land of one under age, when the &s;ale is nece&s;&s;ary for payment of debt: to decline interpo|&s;ing in this ca&s;e, would be ruinous to the proprietor; for without it no man will venture to purcha&s;e from one under age. Here the mo|tive is humanity to a &s;ingle individual: but it would be a great im|perfection in law, to abandon an innocent per&s;on to ruin when the remedy is &s;o ea&s;y. In the ca&s;es governed by the motive of pu|blic utility, a court of equity interpo&s;es as a court properly, gi|ving or denying action, in order to an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed: but in the ca&s;es now mentioned, and in tho&s;e that are &s;imilar, there is &s;eldom occa&s;ion for a proce&s;s; the court acts by magi&s;terial powers.</P>
<P>The powers above &s;et forth a&s;&s;umed by our courts of equity, are, in effect, the &s;ame that were a&s;&s;umed by the Roman Prae|tor, from nece&s;&s;ity, without any expre&s;s authority. <Q REND="inline">"Jus prae|torium e&s;t quod praetores introduxerunt, adjuvandi vel &s;upplendi vel corrigendi juris Civilis gratia, propter utilitatem publicam <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 7. &sect; 1. de ju&s;titia et jure.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="55">
Having given a hi&s;torical view of a court of equity, from its ori|gin to its pre&s;ent extent of power and juri&s;diction, I proceed to &s;ome other general matters, which mu&s;t be premi&s;ed before entering up|on particulars. The fir&s;t I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t on is of the greate&s;t moment, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether a court of equity be, or ought to be, governed by any general rules? To determine every particular ca&s;e according to what is ju&s;t, equal, and &s;alutary, taking in all circum&s;tances, is undoubt|edly the idea of a court of equity in its perfection; and had we an|gels for judges, &s;uch would be their method of proceeding, without regarding any rules: but men are liable to prejudice and error, and for that rea&s;on cannot &s;afely be tru&s;ted with unlimited powers. Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;tabli&s;hing rules, to pre&s;erve uniformity of judgement in matters of equity as well as of common law: the nece&s;|&s;ity is perhaps greater in the former, becau&s;e of the variety and intri|cacy of equitable circum&s;tances. Thus though a particular ca&s;e may require the interpo&s;ition of equity to correct a wrong or &s;upply a de|fect, yet the judge ought not to interpo&s;e, unle&s;s he can found his de|cree upon &s;ome rule that is equally applicable to all ca&s;es of the kind. If he be under no limitation, his decrees will appear arbitrary, though &s;ub&s;tantially ju&s;t: and, which is &s;till wor&s;e, will often be arbitrary, and &s;ub&s;tantially unju&s;t; for &s;uch too frequently is the ca&s;e of human proceedings when &s;ubjected to no control. General rules, it is true, mu&s;t often produce decrees that are materially un|ju&s;t; for no rule can be equally ju&s;t in its application to a whole cla&s;s of ca&s;es that are far from being the &s;ame in every circum&s;tance: but this inconvenience mu&s;t be tolerated, to avoid a greater, that of making judges arbitrary. A court of equity is a happy invention to remedy the errors of common law: but this remedy mu&s;t &s;top &s;ome where; for courts cannot be e&s;tabli&s;hed without end, to be checks one upon another. And hence it is, that, in the nature of things, there cannot be any other check upon a court of equity but general rules.

<P>In peru&s;ing the following treati&s;e, it will be di&s;covered, that the con|nections

regarded by a court of equity &s;eldom ari&s;e from per&s;onal circum&s;tances, &s;uch as birth, re&s;emblance of condition, or even blood, but generally from &s;ubjects that in common language are denominated <HI>goods.</HI> Why &s;hould a court, actuated by the &s;pirit of refined ju&s;tice, overlook more &s;ub&s;tantial ties, to apply it&s;elf to the gro&s;&s;er connections &s;olely, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e of intere&s;t? doth any connec|tion founded on property make an impre&s;&s;ion equally &s;trong with that of friend&s;hip, of blood-relation, or of country? doth not the law of nature form duties on the latter, more binding in con&s;cience than tho&s;e formed on the former? Yet the more con&s;cientious duties are left generally to &s;hift for them&s;elves, while the duties founded on intere&s;t are &s;upported and inforced by courts of equity. This, at fir&s;t view, looks like a prevailing attachment to riches; but it is not &s;o in rea|lity. The duties ari&s;ing from the connection la&s;t mentioned, are generally a&s;certained and circum&s;cribed, &s;o as to be &s;u&s;ceptible of a general rule that governs all ca&s;es of the kind. This is &s;eldom the ca&s;e of the other natural duties; which, for that rea&s;on, mu&s;t be left upon con&s;cience, without receiving any aid from a court of equity. There are, for example, not many duties more firmly rooted in our nature than that of charity; and, upon that account, a court of equity will naturally be tempted to interpo&s;e in its behalf. But the extent of this duty depends on &s;uch a variety of circum&s;tances, that the wi&s;e&s;t heads would in vain labour to bring it under general rules: to tru&s;t, therefore, with any court a power to direct the charity of individuals, is a remedy which to &s;ociety would be more hurtful than the di&s;ea&s;e; for in&s;tead of inforcing this duty in any regular manner, it would open a wide door to legal tyranny and oppre&s;|&s;ion. Viewing the matter in this light, it will appear, that &s;uch duties are left upon con&s;cience, not from neglect or in&s;en&s;ibility, but from the difficulty of a proper remedy. And when &s;uch duties can be brought under a general rule, I except not even gratitude, though in the main little &s;u&s;ceptible of circum&s;cription, we &s;hall &s;ee afterward, that a court of equity declines not to interpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In this work will be found &s;everal in&s;tances where equity and utility are in oppo&s;ition; and when that happens, the que&s;tion is, Which of them ought to prevail? Equity, when it regards the in|tere&s;t of a few individuals only, ought to yield to utility when it regards the whole &s;ociety. It is for that very rea&s;on that a court of equity is bound to form its decrees upon general rules; for this mea&s;ure regards the whole &s;ociety by preventing arbitrary pro|ceedings.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="57">
It is commonly ob&s;erved, that equitable rights are le&s;s &s;teady and permanent than tho&s;e of common law: the rea&s;on will appear from what follows. A right is permanent or fluctuating, according to the circum&s;tances upon which it is founded: while the&s;e remain the &s;ame, &s;o doth the right; when the&s;e vary, the right varies with them: this is applicable to both kinds equally. But here lies the dif|ference. The circum&s;tances that found a right at common law, be|ing always few and weighty, are not variable, nor ea&s;ily changed: a bond of borrowed money, for example, mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t till it be paid. A claim in equity, on the contrary, &s;eldom ari&s;es without a multi|plicity of circum&s;tances, which make it le&s;s &s;teady; for if but a &s;in|gle circum&s;tance be withdrawn, the claim is no more. Let us &s;up|po&s;e, for example, that an infeftment of annualrent is a&s;&s;igned to a creditor for his &s;ecurity; the creditor or a&s;&s;ignee thus &s;ecured, ought to draw his payment out of the intere&s;t before touching the capital; which is an equitable rule, becau&s;e it is favourable to the a&s;&s;ignor or cedent, without hurting the a&s;&s;ignee. But if the cedent have another creditor who arre&s;ts the intere&s;t, the equitable rule now mentioned cea&s;es, and gives place to another; which is, that the a&s;&s;ignee ought to draw his payment out of the capital, leaving the intere&s;t to be drawn by the arre&s;ter. Let us next &s;uppo&s;e, that the cedent hath a third creditor, who after the arre&s;tment adjudges the capital. This new circum&s;tance varies again the rule of equity: for though the ce|dent's intere&s;t weighs not in oppo&s;ition to that of his creditor arre&s;t|ing, the adjudging creditor and the arre&s;ter are upon a level as to every equitable con&s;ideration; and upon that account, the a&s;&s;ignee, who is the preferable or catholic creditor, ought to deal impartially between them: if he chu&s;e not to take his payment out of both &s;ub|jects proportionally, but only out of the capital, or out of the inter|e&s;t, he ought to make an a&s;&s;ignment to the po&s;tponed creditor, in or|der to redre&s;s the inequality; and if he refu&s;e to do this act of ju&s;tice, a court of equity will interpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This example &s;hows the mutability of equitable claims: but there is a cau&s;e which makes them appear &s;till more mutable than they are in reality. The &s;tronge&s;t notion is entertained of the &s;tability of a right of property; becau&s;e no man can be deprived of his property but by his own deed. A claim of debt is under&s;tood to be &s;table, but in an inferior degree; becau&s;e payment puts an end to it without the will of the creditor. But equitable rights, which commonly accrue to a man without any deed of his, are often lo&s;t in the &s;ame manner: and they will naturally be deemed tran&s;itory and fluctuating, when
<PB N="49" REF="58">
they depend &s;o little on the will of the per&s;ons who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them.</P>
<P>In England, where the courts of equity and common law are di&s;|tinct, the boundary betwixt equity and common law, where the le|gi&s;lature doth not interpo&s;e, will remain always the &s;ame. But in Scotland, and other countries where equity and common law are uni|ted in one court, the boundary varies imperceptibly; for what origi|nally is a rule in equity, lo&s;es its character when, gathering &s;trength by practice, it is con&s;idered as common law: thus the <HI>actio negotiorum ge&s;torum,</HI> retention, &s;alvage, &amp;c. are in Scotland &s;carce now con&s;ider|ed as depending on principles of equity. But by the cultivation of &s;ociety, and practice of law, nicer and nicer ca&s;es in equity being daily unfolded, our notions of equity are pre&s;erved alive; and the additions made to that fund, &s;upply what is withdrawn from it, and transferred to common law.</P>
<P>What is now &s;aid &s;ugge&s;ts a que&s;tion, not le&s;s intricate than im|portant, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether common law and equity ought to be com|mitted to the &s;ame or to different courts? The profound Bacon gives his opinion in the following words: <Q REND="inline">"Apud nonnullos receptum e&s;t, ut juri&s;dictio, quae decernit &s;ecundum aequum et bonum, atque illa altera, quae procedit &s;ecundum jus &s;trictum, ii&s;dem curiis de|putentur: apud alios autem, ut diver&s;is: omnino placet curiarum &s;eparatio. Neque enim &s;ervabitur di&s;tinctio ca&s;uum, &s;i fiat com|mixtio juri&s;dictionum: &s;ed arbitrium legem tandem trahet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De aug. &s;cient. l. 8. cap. 3. aph. 45.</NOTE>."</Q> Of all que&s;tions tho&s;e which concern the con&s;titution of a &s;tate, and its police, being the mo&s;t involved in circum&s;tances, are, for that rea|&s;on, the mo&s;t difficult to be brought under preci&s;e principles. I pretend not to deliver any opinion on this point; and feeling in my|&s;elf a bias again&s;t the great authority mentioned, I &s;carce venture to form an opinion. It may be not improper, however, to hazard a few ob&s;ervations preparatory to a more accurate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. I am thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the weight of the argument u&s;ed in the fore|going citation. In the &s;cience of juri&s;prudence, it is undoubtedly of great importance, that the boundary between equity and com|mon law be clearly a&s;certained; without which we &s;hall in vain hope for ju&s;t deci&s;ions. A judge who is uncertain, whether the ca&s;e belong to equity or to common law, cannot have a clear concep|tion what judgment ought to be pronounced: but a court that judges of both, being relieved from determining this preliminary point, will be apt to lo&s;e &s;ight altogether of the di&s;tinction be|tween
<PB N="50" REF="59">
common law and equity. On the other hand, may it not be urged, that the dividing among different courts things intimately connected, bears hard upon every man who has a claim to pro&s;ecute? Before bringing his action, he mu&s;t at his peril determine an ex|treme nice point, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether the ca&s;e be governed by common law, or by equity. An error in this preliminary point, though not fatal to the cau&s;e, becau&s;e a remedy is provided, is, however, produc|tive of much trouble and expence. Nor is the mo&s;t profound know|ledge of law &s;ufficient altogether to prevent this evil; becau&s;e it can|not always be fore&s;een what plea will be put in for the defendant, whether a plea in equity or at common law. In the next place, to us in Scotland it appears in &s;ome degree ab&s;urd, to find a court &s;o con&s;tituted, that in many ca&s;es an iniquitous judgment mu&s;t be the re&s;ult. This not only happens frequently with re&s;pect to covenants, as above mentioned, but will always happen where a claim founded on common law, which mu&s;t be brought before a court of common law, is oppo&s;ed by an equitable defence which cannot be regarded by &s;uch a court. Weighing the&s;e different arguments with &s;ome at|tention, the preponderancy &s;eems to be on the &s;ide of an united juri&s;|diction. The &s;ole inconvenience of an united juri&s;diction, <HI>viz.</HI> that it tends to blend common law with equity, may admit a remedy, by an in&s;titute di&s;tingui&s;hing, with accuracy, their boundaries: but the inconvenience of a divided juri&s;diction admits not any effectual re|medy. The&s;e hints, at the &s;ame time, are &s;ugge&s;ted with the great|e&s;t diffidence; for I cannot be ignorant of the bias that naturally is produced by cu&s;tom and e&s;tabli&s;hed practice.</P>
<P>In Scotland, as well as in other civilized countries, the King's council was originally the only court that had power to remedy de|fects or redre&s;s inju&s;tice, in common law. To this extraordinary power the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion naturally &s;ucceeded, as being the &s;upreme court in civil matters; for in every well-regulated &s;ociety, &s;ome one court mu&s;t be tru&s;ted with this power, and no court more proper|ly than that which is &s;upreme. It may at fir&s;t &s;ight appear &s;urpri|&s;ing, that no mention is made of this extraordinary power in any of the regulations concerning the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. Probably the thing was not intended nor thought of: the nece&s;&s;ity, however, of &s;uch a power brought it in time to an e&s;tabli&s;hment. That the court it&s;elf had at fir&s;t no notion of being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this privilege, is evident from the act of &s;ederunt November 27. 1592, declaring, <Q REND="inline">"That in time coming they will judge and decide upon clau&s;es irritant con|tained in contracts, tacks, infeftments, bonds, and obligations,
<PB N="51" REF="60">
preci&s;ely according to the words and meaning of the &s;ame;"</Q> which in effect was declaring them&s;elves a court of common law, not of equity. But the mi&s;take was &s;oon di&s;covered: the act of &s;ederunt wore out of u&s;e; and now for more than a century, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion hath acted as a court of equity, as well as of common law. Nor is it rare to find powers unfolded in practice that were not in view at the in&s;titution of a court. When the Roman Pretor was created to be the &s;upreme judge, in place of the con&s;uls, there is no appearance that any in&s;tructions were given him concerning matters of equity. And even as to the Engli&s;h court of chancery, though originally a court of equity, there was not at fir&s;t the lea&s;t notion en|tertained of that exten&s;ive juri&s;diction to which in later times it hath ju&s;tly arrived.</P>
<P>In Scotland, the union of common law with equity in the &s;upreme court, appears to have had an influence upon inferior courts, and to have regulated their powers with re&s;pect to equity. The rule in ge|neral is, That inferior courts are confined to common law: and hence it is that an action founded merely upon equity, &s;uch as a reduction upon minority and le&s;ion, upon fraud, &amp;c. is not competent before an inferior court. But if again&s;t a proce&s;s founded on common law, an equitable defence be proponed, it is the practice of inferior courts to judge of &s;uch defence. Imitation of the &s;upreme court, which judges both of law and equity, &s;upported by the inconvenience of removing to another court a proce&s;s that has perhaps long depend|ed, paved the way to this enlargement of power. Another thing al|ready taken notice of, tends to enlarge the powers of our inferior courts more and more; which is, that many actions, founded origi|nally on equity, have, by long practice, obtained an e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;o firm as to be reckoned branches of the common law. This is the ca&s;e of the <HI>actio negotiorum ge&s;torum,</HI> of recompence, and many o|thers, which, for that rea&s;on, are now commonly &s;u&s;tained in infe|rior courts.</P>
<P>Our courts of equity have advanced far in &s;econding the laws of nature, but have not perfected their cour&s;e. Every clear and pal|pable duty is countenanced with an action; but many of the more refined duties, as will be &s;een afterward, are left &s;till without reme|dy. Until men, thoroughly humanized, be generally agreed about the&s;e more refined duties, it is perhaps the more prudent mea&s;ure for a court of equity to leave them upon con&s;cience. Neither doth this court profe&s;s to take under its protection every covenant and agree|ment. Many engagements of various &s;orts, the fruits of idlene&s;s,
<PB N="52" REF="61">
without relation to what may be called bu&s;ine&s;s, are too trifling, or too ludicrous, to merit the countenance of law: a court, whether of common law or of equity, cannot pre&s;erve its dignity if it de&s;cend to &s;uch matters. Wagers of all &s;orts, whether upon hor&s;es, cocks, or accidental events, are of this &s;ort. People may amu&s;e them&s;elves, and men of ea&s;y fortunes may pa&s;s their whole time in diver&s;ion, becau&s;e there is no law again&s;t it; but &s;uch pa&s;time, contrary to its nature, ought not to be converted into a &s;erious matter, by bringing the fruits of it into a court of ju&s;tice. This doctrine &s;eems not to have been thoroughly under&s;tood, when the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, in a ca&s;e reported by Dirleton, &s;u&s;tained action upon what is called there a <HI>&s;pon&s;io ludicra.</HI> A man having taken a piece of gold, under condi|tion to pay back a greater &s;um in ca&s;e he &s;hould ever be married, was after his marriage &s;ued for performance. The court &s;u&s;tained pro|ce&s;s; though &s;everal of the judges were of opinion, that <HI>&s;pon&s;iones lu|dicrae</HI> ought not to be authori&s;ed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">February 9. 1676.</NOTE>. But in the following remarkable ca&s;e, the court judged better. In the year 1698, a bond was exe|cuted of the following tenor: <Q REND="inline">"I Mr William Cochran of Kilmaro|nock, for a certain &s;um of money delivered to me by Mr John Stewart younger of Blackhall, bind and oblige me, my heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to deliver to the &s;aid Mr John Stewart, his heirs execu|tors and a&s;&s;ignees, the &s;um of one hundred guineas in gold, and that &s;o &s;oon as I, or the heirs de&s;cending of my body, &s;hall &s;ucceed to the dignity and e&s;tate of Dundonald."</Q> This &s;um being claim|ed from the heir of the obligor, now become Earl of Dundonald, it was objected, That this being a <HI>&s;pon&s;io ludicra</HI> ought not to be countenanced with an action. It was an&s;wered, That bargains like the pre&s;ent are not again&s;t law; for if purcha&s;ing the hope of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion from a remote heir be lawful <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Fountainhall, July 29. 1708, Rag <HI>contra</HI> Brown.</NOTE>, it cannot be unlawful to give him a &s;um on condition of receiving a greater when he &s;hall &s;ucceed. If an heir pinched for money procure it upon di&s;advantageous terms, equity, it is true, will relieve him: but in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e there is no evidence, nor indeed &s;u&s;picion, of inequality. It was replied, That judges of equity mu&s;t act by a general rule, and mu&s;t either con|demn by the lump &s;uch ludicrous bargains, or approve them by the lump: if they be indulged where they appear to be fair and equal, they mu&s;t be indulged whatever their circum&s;tances be; becau&s;e no preci&s;e boundary can be fixed betwixt that degree of inequality which is permitted, and that which is condemned. In the next
<PB N="53" REF="62">
place, it tends not to the good of &s;ociety to &s;u&s;tain action upon &s;uch bargains: they do not advance commerce, nor contribute in any de|gree to the comforts of life; why then &s;hould a court be bound to &s;upport them? It is &s;ufficient that they are not reprobated, but left upon con&s;cience and private faith. The court refu&s;ed to &s;u&s;tain ac|tion; re&s;erving it to be con&s;idered, whether the pur&s;uer, upon pro|ving the extent of the &s;um given by him, be intitled to demand it back <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Feb. 7. 1753.

<P>The multiplied combinations of individuals in &s;ociety &s;ugge&s;t rules of equity &s;o numerous and various, that in vain would any writer think of collecting all of them. From an undertaking which is in a good mea&s;ure new, all that can be expected is a collection of &s;ome of the capital ca&s;es that occur the mo&s;t frequently in law-proceedings. This collection will comprehend many rules of equity, &s;ome of them probably of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive application. Nor will it be without profit, even as to &s;ubjects omitted; for by diligently ob&s;erving the application of equitable principles to a number of leading ca&s;es, a habit is gradually formed of rea&s;oning correctly upon matters of e|quity, which will enable us to apply the &s;ame principles to new ca&s;es as they occur.</P>
<P>The author having thus given a general view of his &s;ubject, &s;hall fini&s;h with explaining his motive for appearing in public. Prac|ti&s;ing lawyers, to whom the &s;ubject mu&s;t already be familiar, require no in&s;truction. This treati&s;e is dedicated to the &s;tudious in general, &s;uch as are fond to improve their minds by every exerci&s;e of the rational faculties. Writers upon law are too much confined in their views: their works, calculated for lawyers only, are involved in a cloud of ob&s;cure words and terms of art, a language perfectly unknown except to tho&s;e of the profe&s;&s;ion. Thus it happens, that the know|ledge of law, like the hidden my&s;teries of &s;ome ancient deity, is con|fined to its votaries; as if others were in duty bound to blind and implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But &s;uch &s;uper&s;tition, whatever unhappy pro|gre&s;s it may have made in religion, never can prevail in law: men who have life or fortune at &s;take, take the liberty to think for them|&s;elves; and are not le&s;s ready to accu&s;e judges for legal oppre&s;&s;ion, than others for private violence or wrong. Ignorance of law hath in this re&s;pect a mo&s;t unhappy effect: we all regard with partiality our own intere&s;t; and it requires knowledge not le&s;s than candour, to re&s;i&s;t the thought of being treated unju&s;tly when a court pronoun|ceth again&s;t us. Thus peevi&s;hne&s;s and di&s;content ari&s;e, and are vent|ed
<PB N="54" REF="63">
again&s;t the judges of the land. This, in a free government, is a dangerous and infectious &s;pirit, to remedy&punc; which we cannot be too &s;olicitous. Knowledge of tho&s;e rational principles upon which law is founded I venture to &s;ugge&s;t, as a remedy not le&s;s efficacious than palatable. Were &s;uch knowledge univer&s;ally &s;pread, judges who ad|here to rational principles, and who, with &s;uperior under&s;tanding, can reconcile law to common &s;en&s;e, would be revered by the whole &s;ociety. The fame of their integrity, &s;upported by men of parts and reading, would de&s;cend to the lowe&s;t of the people; a thing devout|ly to be wi&s;hed! Nothing tends more to &s;weeten the temper, than a conviction of impartiality in judges; by which we hold our&s;elves &s;ecure again&s;t every in&s;ult or wrong. By this means, peace and con|cord in &s;ociety are promoted, and individuals are finely di&s;ciplined to &s;ubmit with equal deference to all other acts of legal authority. Integrity is not the only duty required in a judge: to behave &s;o as to make every one rely upon his integrity, is a duty not le&s;s e&s;&s;ential. Deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e notions, the author dedicates his work to every lover of &s;cience; and hath endeavoured to explain his &s;ub|ject in a manner that requires in the reader no peculiar knowledge of municipal law. In that view he hath avoided terms of art; not in|deed with a &s;crupulous nicety, which might look like affectation, but &s;o, he hopes, as that with the help of a law-dictionary, what he &s;ays may ea&s;ily be apprehended.</P>
<P>ORDER, a beauty in every compo&s;ition, is e&s;&s;ential in a treati&s;e of equity, which comprehends an endle&s;s variety of matter. To avoid ob&s;curity and confu&s;ion, we mu&s;t, with the &s;tricte&s;t accuracy, bring under one view things intimately connected, and handle &s;eparately things unconnected, or but &s;lightly connected. Two great princi|ples, ju&s;tice and utility, govern the proceedings of a court of equi|ty; and every matter that belongs to that court, is regulated by one or other of the&s;e principles. Hence a divi&s;ion of the pre&s;ent work into two books, the fir&s;t appropriated to ju&s;tice, the &s;econd to utility. I propo&s;e a third book for certain &s;ubjects, which con&s;i&s;t of parts too intimately connected to bear a &s;eparation; each of which is handled as one entire whole, in&s;tead of being broken into parts, and handled &s;eparately for illu&s;trating one or other principle, as is done in the two fir&s;t books.</P>

<P>IN the introduction occa&s;ion was taken to &s;how, that a court of equity is nece&s;&s;ary, fir&s;t, to &s;upply the defects of common law, and, next, to correct its rigour or inju&s;tice. The nece&s;&s;ity in the former ca&s;e is manife&s;t from a principle, That where there is a right it ought to be made effectual; in the latter from another principle, That for every wrong there ought to be a remedy. In both the di&s;pute generally turns upon pecuniary intere&s;t. But there is a legal intere&s;t which is not pecuniary; and which, for the &s;ake of per&s;picuity, ought to be handled &s;eparately. In this view, the pre|&s;ent book is divided into two parts. In the fir&s;t are treated, the powers of a court of equity to &s;upply defects and to correct inju|&s;tice in the common law, with re&s;pect to pecuniary intere&s;t: and in the &s;econd, the powers of a court of equity with re&s;pect to matters of ju&s;tice that are not pecuniary.</P>

<P>THE &s;ocial &s;tate, however di&s;ireable, could never have taken place among men, were they not re&s;trained by a moral princi|ple from injuring tho&s;e of their own &s;pecies. To ab&s;tain from in|juring others, is accordingly the primary law of &s;ociety, inforced by the mo&s;t vigorous &s;anctions: every culpable tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of that law &s;ubjects the wrong-doer to reparation; and every intentional tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion &s;ubjects him, not only to reparation, but al&s;o to puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="66">
The moral principle of ab&s;taining from injuring others, naturally takes the lead in every in&s;titute of law; and as the inforcing that principle has been a capital object in e&s;tabli&s;hing courts of ju&s;tice, it is proper to commence a treati&s;e of equity with examining in what ca&s;es the interpo&s;ition of a court of equity is required to make it ef|fectual; which can only be where no remedy is provided at common law.</P>
<P>The ways are endle&s;s by which men may be hurt in their per&s;ons and in their property; but it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that there are very few ca&s;es but what may be brought under one or other of the follow|ing cla&s;&s;es. Fir&s;t, Harm done in pro&s;ecuting one's own right or privilege. Second, Harm done without intending to pro&s;e|cute any right or privilege. Third, Undue influence employ'd for tempting or overawing others to &s;acrifice knowingly their own intere&s;t. Fourth, Fraud, deceit, or other artificial means, employ'd to make others act unknowingly again&s;t their intere&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. Harm done by a man in pro&s;ecuting a right or privilege.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ocial &s;tate, which, on the one hand, is highly beneficial by the opportunity it affords for mutual aid and &s;upport, is, on the other, attended with &s;ome inconveniencies, as in tho&s;e particular ca&s;es where a man cannot have the free exerci&s;e of a right or privi|lege without harming others. How far &s;uch exerci&s;e may be indul|ged by the law of our nature, is a que&s;tion of nice di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. That men are born in a &s;tate of freedom and independency, is an e&s;tabli&s;h|ed truth; but whether that freedom and independency may not ad|mit of &s;ome limitation from the colli&s;ion of oppo&s;ite rights and privileges, de&s;erves to be examined. If the free exerci&s;e of my rights be indulged me without regarding the harm that may en&s;ue to ano|ther, that other is &s;o far under my power, and his intere&s;t &s;o far &s;ubjected to mine. On the other &s;ide, if I be re&s;trained from the exerci&s;e of my rights and privileges in every ca&s;e where harm may en&s;ue to another, I am &s;o far dependent upon that other, and my intere&s;t &s;o far &s;ubjected to his. Here is a threatening appearance for civil &s;ociety, that &s;eems to admit no re&s;ource but force and vio|lence. Ca&s;es there certainly are that admit no other re&s;ource; as where in a &s;hipwreck two per&s;ons lay hold of the &s;ame plank, one
<PB N="58" REF="67">
of whom mu&s;t be thru&s;t off that both may not go to the bottom. But upon the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition, we are not reduced to that deplo|rable dilemma; for nature has temper'd the&s;e oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts by a rule not le&s;s beautiful than &s;alutary. This rule con&s;i&s;ts of two branches: the fir&s;t is, That even the pro&s;ecution of my own right will not ju&s;tify me in doing any action that directly harms another; and &s;o far my intere&s;t yields to his: the &s;econd is, That in pro&s;ecu|ting my right I am not concerned with any indirect or con&s;equential damage that another may &s;uffer; and &s;o far the intere&s;t of others yields to mine: I am &s;orry if my neighbour happen thus to &s;uffer; but I feel no check of con&s;cience on that account. The fir&s;t branch re&s;olves into a principle inculcated in the preliminary di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That no intere&s;t of mine, not even the pre&s;ervation of life it&s;elf, au|thori&s;es me to do any mi&s;chief to an innocent per&s;on. The other branch is founded on expediency in oppo&s;ition to ju&s;tice; for if the po&s;&s;ibility of harming others, whether fore&s;een or not fore&s;een, were &s;ufficient to re&s;train me from pro&s;ecuting my own rights and privi|leges, men would be too much cramped in action, or rather would be reduced to a &s;tate of ab&s;olute inactivity.</P>
<P>This rule, which is far from being &s;imple or obvious in its applica|tion, requires the illu&s;tration of various examples. I begin with ex|amples of the fir&s;t branch. However profitable it may be to purge my &s;uperior field of water, yet it is univer&s;ally admitted, that I can|not legally open a new pa&s;&s;age for it into my neighbour's ground; becau&s;e this is a direct damage to him: <Q REND="inline">"Sic enim debere quem me|liorem agrum &s;uum facere ne vicini deteriorem faciat <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De aqua, et aquae pluv. l. 1. &sect; 4.</NOTE>."</Q> Where a river is interjected between my property and that of my neighbour, it is not lawful for me to alter its natural cour&s;e, whether by throw|ing it upon my neighbour's ground, or by depriving him of it; be|cau&s;e the&s;e acts, both of them, are direct incroachments upon my neighbour's property. Neratius puts the ca&s;e of a lake which in a rainy &s;ea&s;on overflows the neighbouring grounds, to prevent which on one &s;ide a bulwark is erected. And he gives his opinion, that if this bulwark have the effect, in a rainy &s;ea&s;on, to throw a greater quantity of water than u&s;ual upon the oppo&s;ite grounds, it ought to be demoli&s;hed <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De aqua, et aquae pluv. l. 1. &sect; 2.</NOTE>. This opinion is undoubtedly well founded at com|mon law; becau&s;e by the &s;uppo&s;ition the bulwark is directly preju|dicial to the neighbouring proprietor. But this rule &s;trictly followed would bar many improvements; and for that rea&s;on there is room for the interpo&s;ition of a court of equity to mitigate the common law
<PB N="59" REF="68">
upon the principle of utility. It will indulge me to rai&s;e a fence within my own property, to prevent my ground from being over|&s;low'd by a river when in flood, or by a lake: if this work tend at times to throw a greater weight of water upon my neighbour, he may fence his ground as I did.</P>
<P>The foregoing examples, being all of the &s;ame kind, are governed by a practical rule, That we mu&s;t not throw any thing into our neighbour's ground, <HI>Ne immittas in alienum,</HI> as expre&s;&s;ed in the Ro|man law. But the principle goes a great way further, obliging us to ab&s;tain from every operation that has directly the effect to make our neighbour's property u&s;ele&s;s or incomfortable to him. <Q REND="inline">"It &s;eems the better opinion, that a brew-hou&s;e, gla&s;s-hou&s;e, chandler's &s;hop, or &s;tie for &s;wine, &s;et up in &s;uch inconvenient parts of a town that they cannot but greatly incommode the neighbourhood, are com|mon nui&s;ances <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A new abridgement of the law, vol. 3. p. 686.</NOTE>."</Q> Neighbours in a town mu&s;t &s;ubmit to inconve|niences from each other; but they mu&s;t be protected from extraor|dinary di&s;turbances that render their property in a great mea&s;ure u&s;e|le&s;s to them. Upon this principle the court was of opinion, that the working in the upper &s;tory of a large tenement with weighty ham|mers upon an anvil, is a nui&s;ance; and it was decreed that the black|&s;mith &s;hould remove at the next term <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Kinloch of Gilmerton again&s;t Robert&s;on, Dec. 9. 1756.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Now as to the &s;econd branch of the rule: It is agreed by all, that where my property lies upon the &s;ide of a river that is gradually in|croaching upon me, I may fence my bank in order to prevent fur|ther incroachments; for this work does not tend to produce even in|direct or con&s;equential damage: all the effect it can operate is, to prevent my neighbour from gaining ground on his &s;ide. A much narrower ca&s;e is determined in the Roman law, That I may lawfully dig a pit in my own land for gathering water to my cattle, though it happens to intercept a &s;pring that run under ground into my neighbour's field, and furni&s;hed him with water <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">De aqua, et aquae pluv. l. 1. &sect; 12.</NOTE>. For in this ca&s;e the lo&s;s to my neighbour is con&s;equential only by intercepting a be|nefit from him. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, I may build a hou&s;e upon my march though it intercept the light from my neighbour's hou&s;e; and a dry &s;ummer will not re&s;train me from the accu&s;tomed u&s;e of a rill running through my ground, though it may bring it &s;o low as to be of no &s;ervice to my neighbour.</P>
<P>But with regard to this branch of the rule, there is a limitation
<PB N="60" REF="69">
founded entirely upon equity; which is, That however lawful it may be for a man to exerci&s;e his right for his own benefit where the harm that en&s;ues is only con&s;equential; yet that the exerci&s;e is un|lawful if it be done intentionally to di&s;tre&s;s others, without any view of benefiting him&s;elf. Rights and privileges are be&s;tow'd on us for our own good; but by no means for hurting our neighbours. Ma|levolence is condemned by all laws, natural and municipal: a ma|levolent act of the kind mentioned is condemned by the actor him|&s;elf in his &s;edate moments; and he finds him&s;elf in con&s;cience bound to repair the mi&s;chief he has thus done. The common law, it is true, overlooks intention, con&s;idering the act in no other view but as a legal exerci&s;e of a right. But equity holds intention to be the capital part, being that which determines an action to be right or wrong; and affords reparation accordingly. Hence a general rule in equity, That ju&s;tice will not permit a man to exerci&s;e his right where his intention is &s;olely to hurt another; which in law-language is termed the acting <HI>in aemulationem vicini.</HI> In all ca&s;es of this nature, a court of equity will give redre&s;s by voiding the act, if that can be done; otherwi&s;e by awarding a &s;um in name of damages. We pro|ceed to examples.</P>
<P>A man may lawfully dig a pit in his own field in order to inter|cept a vein of water that runs below the &s;urface into his neighbour's property, provided his purpo&s;e be to have water for his own u&s;e: but if his purpo&s;e be to hurt his neighbour without any view to bene|fit him&s;elf, the act is unlawful, as proceeding from a malevolent in|tention; and a court of equity will re&s;train him from this opera|tion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De aqua, et aquae pluv l 1. &sect; 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ame principle is founded the noted practice, in a court of equity, of refu&s;ing to &s;u&s;tain an action at law unle&s;s the plaintiff can &s;how an intere&s;t; for if he can take no benefit by the action, the pre&s;umption mu&s;t be, that it is calculated to di&s;tre&s;s the defendant, and done <HI>in aemulationem vicini.</HI></P>
<P>In order to e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>jus crediti</HI> in an a&s;&s;ignee, and totally to dive&s;t the cedent or a&s;&s;ignor, the law of Scotland requires, that notification of the a&s;&s;ignment be made to the debtor, verified by an in&s;trument under the hand of a notary termed <HI>an intimation.</HI> Before intimation the legal right is in the cedent, and the a&s;&s;ignee has a claim in equity only. In this ca&s;e, payment made to the cedent by the debtor igno|rant of the a&s;&s;ignment, is in all re&s;pects the &s;ame as if there were no a&s;&s;ignment: it is payment made to the creditor, which, in law, mu&s;t
<PB N="61" REF="70">
extingui&s;h the debt. But what if the debtor, when he makes pay|ment to the cedent before intimation, be in the knowledge of the a&s;&s;ignment? The common law knows no creditor but him who is legally ve&s;ted in the right; and therefore, di&s;regarding the debtor's knowledge of the a&s;&s;ignment, it will &s;u&s;tain the payment made to the cedent as made to the legal creditor. But equity teaches a dif|ferent doctrine. It was wrong in the cedent to take payment after he convey'd his right to the a&s;&s;ignee: and though the debtor was only exerci&s;ing his own right in making payment to the cedent, who is &s;till the creditor; yet being in the knowledge of the a&s;&s;ignment, the pay|ment mu&s;t have been made intentionally to di&s;tre&s;s the a&s;&s;ignee, without benefiting him&s;elf. A court of equity, therefore, correcting the inju&s;tice of common law, will hold as nothing the payment wrongou&s;ly made to the cedent, and will oblige the debtor to make payment to the a&s;&s;ignee.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to this matter, there is a wide difference between the &s;olemnities that may be requi&s;ite for ve&s;ting in an a&s;&s;ignee a com|plete right to the &s;ubject, and what are &s;ufficient to bar the debtor from making payment to the cedent. In the former view, a regular intimation in nece&s;&s;ary, or &s;ome &s;olemn act equivalent to a regular intimation, a proce&s;s for example. In the latter view, the private knowledge of the debtor is &s;ufficient; and hence it is, that a promi&s;e of payment made to the a&s;&s;ignee, though not equivalent to a regular in|timation, is yet &s;ufficient to bar the debtor from making payment to the cedent. The court went farther: they were of opinion, that the a&s;&s;ignee having &s;hown his a&s;&s;ignment to the debtor, though with|out intimating the &s;ame by a notary, the debtor was thereby put <HI>in mala fide,</HI> and could not thereafter make payment to the cedent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, February 16. 1703, Leith contra Garden.</NOTE>. But hi&s;torical knowledge of an a&s;&s;ignment, where it falls &s;hort of ocular evidence, will &s;carce be &s;u&s;tained to put the debtor <HI>in mala &s;ide.</HI> And this rule is founded on utility: a debtor ought not to be furni&s;hed with pretexts again&s;t payment; and if private conviction of an a&s;&s;ignment, without certain knowledge, were &s;ufficient, private conviction would often be affected, to gain time, and to delay pay|ment.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Harm done by a per&s;on who has not in view to pro&s;ecute any right or pri|vilege.</HEAD>
<P>IN tracing the hi&s;tory of courts of law with re&s;pect to this branch, one beforehand would conjecture, that common law &s;hould regard no acts injuring others in their rights and privileges, but where mi&s;chief is intended; neglecting acts that are culpable only, as having a foun|dation too &s;light for that law. But upon examination we di&s;cover a very different plan; &s;o different as that damage occa&s;ioned even by the &s;lighte&s;t fault is, and always was repaired in courts of common law. Nor ought we to be &s;urpri&s;ed at this exten&s;ion of common law, which was no &s;ubtile refinement, but rather the contrary. In the criminal law, very little di&s;tinction was originally made between a criminal and a culpable act, even with re&s;pect to puni&s;hment <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torical law-tracts, tract 1.</NOTE>, not to talk of reparation. And this practice, &s;o gro&s;s in reality as well as in ap|pearance, was conformable to the manners of tho&s;e times; the pa&s;|&s;ion of re&s;entment, in a fierce and lawle&s;s people, being rou&s;ed by the &s;lighte&s;t harm, and being too violent for any deliberate di&s;tinc|tion between intentional and culpable wrongs. In fact, both were e|qually &s;ubjected to puni&s;hment, even after the power of puni&s;hment was transferred to the magi&s;trate. And of this we have a notable example in the <HI>lex Aquilia</HI> among the Romans: <Q REND="inline">"Qui &s;ervum a|lienum, quadrupedem aut pecudem, injuria occiderit; quanti id in eo anno plurimi fuit, tantum aes dare domino damnas e&s;to <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 2. p. ad. leg. Aquil.</NOTE>."</Q> Here the word <HI>injuria</HI> is interpreted, <Q REND="inline">"quod non jure factum e&s;t; i. e. &s;i culpa quis occiderit <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 5. &sect; 1. ad. leg. Aquil.</NOTE>."</Q> The retro&s;pect here may happen to be a great puni&s;hment; for the obliging a man who kills a lame hor&s;e not worth fifty &s;hillings, to pay fifty pounds becau&s;e the hor&s;e was of that value &s;ome months before, is evidently a puni&s;hment. And as even a <HI>culpa levi&s;&s;ima</HI> &s;ubjects a man to the <HI>lex Aquilia</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">l. 44. cod.</NOTE>, it is clear that the &s;lighte&s;t fault by which damage en&s;ues is puni&s;hable by that law. The <HI>lex Aquilia</HI> was accordingly held by all to be pe|nal; and for that rea&s;on no action upon it was &s;u&s;tained again&s;t the heir <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">l. 23. &sect; 8. ad. leg. Aquil.</NOTE>. The only thing &s;upri&s;ing is, to find this law continuing in force, without alteration or improvement, down to the reign of the Emperor Ju&s;tinian. The Roman law was cultivated by men of the
<PB N="63" REF="72">
greate&s;t genius, and was celebrated all over the world for its equi|table deci&s;ions: is it not amazing, that in an enlightened age &s;uch gro&s;s inju&s;tice &s;hould prevail, as to make even the &s;lighte&s;t fault a ground for puni&s;hment?</P>
<P>When &s;uch was the common law of the Romans with regard to puni&s;hment, there can be no difficulty to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on why that law was extended to reparation even for the &s;lighte&s;t fault; and as little, to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on why the &s;ame obtains in the common law of mo&s;t European nations, the principles of which are borrowed from the Roman law. The penal branch, it is true, of wrongs that are culpable only, and not criminal, has been long aboli&s;hed; having given way to the gradual improvement of the moral &s;en&s;e, which dictates, that where there is no intention to do mi&s;chief, there ought to be no puni&s;hment; and that the per&s;on who is hurt by a fault on|ly, not by a crime, cannot ju&s;tly demand more than reparation. And as this is the pre&s;ent practice of all civilized nations, it is clear that the reparation of damage occa&s;ioned by acts of violence comes under courts of common law, which con&s;equently is &s;o far a bar to a court of equity.</P>
<P>And con&s;idering, that regulations re&s;training individuals from in|juring others and compelling them to perform their engagements, compo&s;ed originally the bulk of common law <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Introduction.</NOTE>, it will not be &s;ur|pri&s;ing, that courts of common law took early under their cogni|&s;ance every culpable act that occa&s;ions mi&s;chief; which was the more nece&s;&s;ary, in re&s;pect that, puni&s;hment being laid a&s;ide, reparation is the only mean left for repre&s;&s;ing a culpable act. Thus we find ample provi&s;ion made by common law, not only again&s;t intentional mi&s;|chief, but al&s;o again&s;t mi&s;chief that is only fore&s;een, not intended. And &s;o far there is no occa&s;ion for a court of equity.</P>
<P>But it is not &s;ufficient for the &s;ecurity of individuals in &s;ociety, that a man him&s;elf be prohibited from doing mi&s;chief: he ought over and above to be careful and vigilant, that per&s;ons, animals, and things, under his power, do no mi&s;chief; and if he neglect this branch of his duty, he is liable to repair the mi&s;chief that en&s;ues, equally as if it had proceeded from his own act. 1&s;t, With re&s;pect to &s;ervants, it is the ma&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s to make a right choice, and to keep them under proper di&s;cipline; and therefore, if they do any mi&s;|chief that might have been fore&s;een and prevented, he is liable. Thus, if a pa&s;&s;enger be hurt by my &s;ervant's throwing a &s;tone out of a win|dow in my hou&s;e, or have his cloaths &s;ullied by dirty water poured
<PB N="64" REF="73">
down upon him, the damage mu&s;t be repaired by me at the fir&s;t in|&s;tance; re&s;erving to me relief again&s;t my &s;ervant. But if a man be killed or wounded by my &s;ervant in a &s;cuffle, I am not liable; unle&s;s it can be &s;pecified, that I knew him to be quarrel&s;ome, and con&s;e|quently might have fore&s;een the mi&s;chief. 2d, With re&s;pect to ani|mals, it is the proprietor's duty to guard them from doing harm; and if harm en&s;ue that might have been fore&s;een, he is bound to re|pair the damage: as, for example, where he &s;uffers his cattle to pa|&s;ture in his neighbour's field; or where the mi&s;chief is done by a bea&s;t of a vicious kind; or even by an ox or a hor&s;e, which, contrary to its nature, he knows to be mi&s;chievous <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exodus, chap. xxi. 29. 36.</NOTE>. 3d, As to things, it is al&s;o the duty of the proprietor to keep them from doing harm. Thus both fiar and liferenter were made liable to repair the mi&s;chief occa&s;ioned to a neighbouring tenement by the fall of their hou&s;e <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, 16th February 1666, Kay contra Littlejohn.</NOTE>. It is the duty of a man who carries &s;tones in a waggon along the highway, to pack them neatly, in order to prevent harm; and if, by carele&s;s package, a &s;tone drop out and brui&s;e a pa&s;&s;enger, the man is liable. But as to ca&s;es of this kind, it is a good defence again&s;t a claim of reparation, that the claimant &s;uffered by his own fault: <Q REND="inline">"Si quis aliquem evitans, magi&s;tratum forte, in taberna proxima &s;e immi&s;i&s;&s;et, ibique a cane feroce lae&s;us e&s;&s;et, non po&s;&s;e agi canis nomine quidam putant: at &s;i &s;olutus fui&s;&s;et, contra <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 2. &sect; 1.

<P>Thus, with re&s;pect to matters falling under the pre&s;ent &s;ection, it appears, that faults come under common law as well as crimes, and omi&s;&s;ions as well as commi&s;&s;ions; and therefore &s;o far the common law appears complete, leaving no gleanings to a court of equity.</P>

<P>JEAN MACKIE, heire&s;s of Maidland, having di&s;poned &s;everal par|cels of land lying about the town of Wigton, to per&s;ons who were mo&s;tly innkeepers there, a reduction was brought, upon the head of fraud and circumvention, by her &s;i&s;ter, next heir in virtue of a &s;ettle|ment.

<HEAD><HI>ART. II.</HI> Where a man is overaw'd to act knowingly again&s;t his own intere&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>IF it be a moral wrong to tempt a weak man to act again&s;t his in|tere&s;t, extortion is a wrong &s;till more flagrant, by its nearer approach to open violence. What, therefore, only remains upon this article, is to illu&s;trate it by examples.</P>
<P>Every benefit taken indirectly by a creditor, for the granting of which no impul&s;ive cau&s;e appears but the money lent, will be voided as extorted. Thus an a&s;&s;ignment to a lea&s;e was voided, being grant|ed of the &s;ame date with a bond of borrowed money, and acknow|ledged to have had no other cau&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, June 20. 1696, Sutherland contra Sinclair.</NOTE>.

<P>Rigorous creditors go &s;ometimes differently to work. If they dare not venture upon greater profit directly than is permitted by law, they aim at it indirectly, by &s;tipulating &s;evere irritancies upon failure of payment. One &s;tipulation of that &s;ort which makes a great figure in our law, is, That if the &s;um lent upon a wad&s;et or pledge be not repaid at the term covenanted, the property of the wad&s;et or pledge &s;hall, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> be transferred to the creditor in &s;atisfaction of the debt. It is that paction, which in the Roman law is named <HI>lex commi&s;&s;oria in pignoribus,</HI> and which in that law &s;eems to be totally reprobated <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">l. ult. C. De pactis pignorum.</NOTE>. With us it mu&s;t be effectual at common law, becau&s;e there is no &s;tatute again&s;t it. But then, as it is a hard and rigorous condition, extorted from a nece&s;&s;itous debtor, a court of equity will interpo&s;e to give relief. And this can be done by following a general rule that is applicable to all ca&s;es of the kind; which is, to admit the debtor to redeem his pledge by payment, at any time, until a declara|tor be brought by the creditor, &s;ignifying his will to hold the pledge
<PB N="67" REF="76">
in place of his money. This proce&s;s affords the debtor an opportuni|ty to purge his failure by payment; which is all that in fair dealing the creditor can demand. And thus the declarator &s;erves a double purpo&s;e: it declares the creditor's option to take the land in place of his money; and it relieves the debtor from the hard&s;hip of a penal irritancy, by furni&s;hing him an opportunity to pay the debt.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that the power of redeeming the wad&s;et or pledge belongs to the debtor, in all ca&s;es, whether the bargain be lucrative or not. A declarator being nece&s;&s;ary, the property cannot thereby be transferred to the creditor, unle&s;s the debtor decline to re|deem his pledge: and this option he mu&s;t have, whether the creditor have made profit or not by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pledge. Suppo&s;ing a proper wad&s;et granted, by which the creditor makes more than the intere&s;t of his money; ju&s;tice requires, that the debtor have a power to redeem even after the term limited, until the equity of redemption be foreclo&s;ed by a declarator; and if a declarator be nece&s;&s;ary, as is proved, the debtor mu&s;t have the &s;ame privilege, even where the cre|ditor has drawn le&s;s than his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>In equity, however, a material difference will be ob&s;erved between a proper wad&s;et with a <HI>pactum legis commi&s;&s;oriae,</HI> and a proper wad&s;et where the term of redemption is not limited. In the latter ca&s;e, the parties &s;tand upon an equal footing: the creditor may demand his money when he plea&s;es; and he has no claim for intere&s;t, becau&s;e of his agreement to accept the rents in&s;tead of intere&s;t: the debtor, on the other hand, may redeem his land when he plea&s;es, upon repay|ment of the &s;um borrowed, without being liable to any intere&s;t, be|cau&s;e of the &s;aid agreement. But the matter turns out differently in equity, where the power of redemption is by paction limited to a certain term. There being no limitation upon the creditor, he may demand his money when he plea&s;es; and he has no claim for intere&s;t, even though the rents have fallen &s;hort of the intere&s;t. But if the debtor in&s;i&s;t upon the equity of redemption after the term to which the redemption is limited; he mu&s;t, be&s;ide repaying the &s;um borrow|ed, make good the intere&s;t, &s;o far as the rent of the land has proved deficient. For impartiality is e&s;&s;ential to a court of equity: if the one party be relieved again&s;t the rigour of a covenant, the other has the &s;ame claim: after taking the land from the creditor contrary to paction, it would be gro&s;s inju&s;tice to hold the paction good again&s;t him, by limiting him to le&s;s intere&s;t than he is intitled to by law up|on an ordinary loan <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To this ca&s;e is applicable an Engli&s;h maxim of equity, <Q REND="inline">"That he that demands equity mu&s;t give equity."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="77">
From what is &s;aid it will be clear, that a power of redeeming with|in a limited time annexed to a proper &s;ale for an adequate price, can|not be exerci&s;ed after the term limited for the redemption is pa&s;t. The purcha&s;er, to whom the property was transferred from the be|ginning, has no occa&s;ion for a declarator; nor doth equity require the time for redemption to be enlarged contrary to paction, in a ca&s;e where an adequate price is given for the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>MANY other hard and oppre&s;&s;ive conditions in bonds of borrowed money, invented by rigorous creditors for their own conveniency, without the lea&s;t regard to humanity or equity, were repre&s;&s;ed by the act 140. parl. 1592. And, by the authority of that &s;tatute, &s;uch pactions may be brought under challenge in courts of common law, again&s;t which otherwi&s;e no remedy could be afforded except in a court of equity.</P>
<P>It was perhaps the &s;tatute now mentioned which mi&s;led the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion into an opinion, that it belongs to the legi&s;lature &s;olely to repre&s;s &s;uch rigorous conditions in agreements as are &s;tated above. One thing is certain, that immediately after the &s;tatute there is an act of &s;ederunt, November 27. 1592, in which the court declares, <Q REND="inline">"That, in time coming, they will judge and decide upon clau&s;es irritant contained in contracts, tacks, infeftments, bonds, and ob|ligations, preci&s;ely according to the words and meaning of the &s;ame."</Q> Such a re&s;olution, proper for a court of common law, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of a court of equity. The mi&s;take was &s;oon di&s;covered: the act of &s;ederunt wore out of ob&s;ervance; and now, for a long time, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion has acted as a court of equity in this as well as in other matters.</P>
<P>IT is u&s;ury by &s;tatute to bargain with a debtor for more than the legal intere&s;t; but it is not u&s;ury to take a proper wad&s;et, even where the rent of the land exceeds the intere&s;t of the money. For the cre|ditor who accepts the rent in&s;tead of intere&s;t, takes upon him&s;elf the in&s;olvency of the tenants; and the hazard of this in&s;olvency, howe|ver &s;mall, &s;aves from u&s;ury; which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;tipulating a yearly &s;um certain above the legal intere&s;t. But though &s;uch a bargain, where the rent exceeds the legal intere&s;t, is not, &s;trictly &s;peaking, u&s;ury; it is rigorous and oppre&s;&s;ive, and plainly &s;peaks out the want of credit in the per&s;on who &s;ubmits to it; upon which account, it might be thought a proper &s;ubject for equity, did we not reflect that all wad&s;ets are not lucrative. When &s;uch is the ca&s;e, what &s;hall be
<PB N="69" REF="78">
the judge's conduct? Mu&s;t he give an opinion upon every wad&s;et according to its peculiar circum&s;tances? or ought he to follow &s;ome rule that is applicable to all ca&s;es of the kind? The former opens a door to arbitrary proceedings: the latter fettering a judge, forces him often to do what is materially unju&s;t. Here equity, regarding individuals, weighs again&s;t utility, regarding the whole &s;ociety. The latter being by far the more weighty con&s;ideration, mu&s;t pre|ponderate: and for that rea&s;on only are wad&s;ets tolerated, even the mo&s;t lucrative; for it is not &s;afe to give any redre&s;s in equity.</P>
<P>This doctrine may be illu&s;trated by a different ca&s;e. A debtor &s;tanding per&s;onally bound for payment of the legal intere&s;t, is com|pelled to give an additional real &s;ecurity, by infefting the creditor in certain lands, the rent of which is paid in corn, with this provi&s;o, <Q REND="inline">"That the creditor, if he chu&s;e to levy the rents for his payment, &s;hall not be &s;ubjected to an account, but &s;hall hold the rents in lieu of his intere&s;t."</Q> This, from what is ob&s;erved above, is not u&s;ury; becau&s;e the value of the corn, however much above the in|tere&s;t in common years, may po&s;&s;ibly fall below it. But as the cre|ditor is in all events &s;ecure of his intere&s;t by having his debtor bound per&s;onally, and may often draw more than his intere&s;t by le|vying the rent when corn &s;ells high; equity will relieve again&s;t the inequality of this bargain. For here the court may follow a general rule, applicable to all ca&s;es of the kind, affording a remedy equally complete in every &s;ingle ca&s;e; which is, to oblige the creditor to ac|count for every farthing he receives more than his intere&s;t, and to im|pute the &s;ame into his capital. In the ca&s;e of a proper wad&s;et this rule would be unju&s;t, becau&s;e the creditor has a chance of getting le&s;s than his intere&s;t, which ought to be compen&s;ated with &s;ome benefit beyond the ordinary profit of money: and if the door be once opened to an extraordinary benefit, a preci&s;e boundary cannot be a&s;certained between more and le&s;s. But the covenant now mentioned is in its very conception oppre&s;&s;ive; and the creditor may ju&s;tly be deprived of the extraordinary benefit he draws from it, when he is, in all events, &s;ecure of the legal intere&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Pacta contra &s;idem tabularum nuptialium</HI> belong to this article. Such private pactions between the bridegroom and his father, contrary to the faith of the public treaty of marriage, are fraudulent as to the wife and children, who will be relieved upon the head of fraud. But the hu&s;band cannot be relieved upon that head, becau&s;e as to him there is no fraud: he is relieved upon the head of extortion.

Every &s;uch private paction is, by con&s;truction of law, extorted from him: and the con&s;truction is ju&s;t, con&s;idering his dependent &s;itua|tion; for the fear of lo&s;ing his bride, leaves him not at liberty to refu&s;e any hard terms that may be impo&s;ed by his father, who &s;ettles the e&s;tate upon him.

<HEAD>SECT. IV. Fraud, deceit, or other artificial means, employ'd for making a man act un|knowingly again&s;t his intere&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>IT is thought, that a court of common law &s;eldom interpo&s;es in any of the ca&s;es that come under the &s;ection immediately foregoing; and the rea&s;on is, that whether a man be led again&s;t his own intere&s;t by a violent temptation or by extortion, there is &s;till left to him in appearance a free choice. But with re&s;pect to the matters that belong to the pre&s;ent &s;ection, a man is led blindly again&s;t his own intere&s;t, and has no choice. This &s;pecies of wrong, therefore, being more flagrant, is not neglected by courts of common law. It is according|ly laid down as a general rule in the Engli&s;h law, <Q REND="inline">"That without the expre&s;s provi&s;ion of any act of parliament, all deceitful practi|ces in defrauding another of his known right, by means of &s;ome artful device, contrary to the plain rules of common hone&s;ty, are condemned by the common law, and puni&s;hed according to the heinou&s;ne&s;s of the offence <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">New abridgement of the law, vol. 2. p. 594.</NOTE>."</Q> Thus the cau&s;ing an illiterate per|&s;on to execute a deed to his prejudice, by reading it to him in words different from tho&s;e in the deed, is a fraud, which a court of com|mon law will redre&s;s, by &s;etting the deed a&s;ide.

<P><PB N="74" REF="83">
In general, every covenant procured by fraud will be &s;et a&s;ide in a court of common law. But with regard to covenants or agreements di&s;regarded at common law, there can be no relief but in a court of equity. Thus a policy of in&s;urance was &s;et a&s;ide upon fraud by a bill in chancery <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2. Vernon 206.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We next proceed to inquire, whether every deceitful practice to im|po&s;e upon others comes under common law. Fraud con&s;i&s;ts in my per&s;uading a man who has confidence in me, to do an act as for his own intere&s;t, which I know will have the contrary effect. But in whatever manner a man be deceived or mi&s;&s;ed, yet if he was not deceived by relying upon the friend&s;hip and integrity of another, it is not a fraud. Fraud therefore implies treachery, without which no artifice nor double dealing can be termed <HI>fraud</HI> in a proper &s;en&s;e. But there are double-fac'd circum&s;tances without number, and other artful means, calculated to deceive, which do not involve any degree of treachery: when a man &s;uffers him&s;elf to be deceived by &s;uch arti|fice, it mu&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure be his own fault, and by&s;tanders are more apt to make him the object of their ridicule than of their &s;or|row; for which rea&s;on frauds of this inferior nature have been over|looked by common law. But as every attempt to deceive another to his prejudice is criminal in con&s;cience, it is the duty of a court of equity to repre&s;s &s;uch deceit, by awarding reparation to the per&s;on who &s;uffers. And utility pleads for reparation as well as equity; for if law were not attentive to repre&s;s deceit in its bud, corruption would gain ground, and even the gro&s;&s;e&s;t frauds would become too &s;tubborn for law.

But if he had bankruptcy in view, and no pro&s;pect to pay the price, the bargain, brought about by a palpable cheat, will be reduced in a court of equity, and the &s;ubject be re&s;tored to the vender. The only thorny point is, to detect the <HI>animus</HI> of the purcha&s;er to defraud the vender. In the ca&s;e of Jo&s;eph Cave <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dict. tit.

There may however be other circum&s;tances concurring with in&s;olvency to enlarge that period. Gilbert Barclay merchant in Cromarty was in labouring circum&s;tances, and owed much more than he was worth, when he made a purcha&s;e of &s;almon from Mackay of Bighou&s;e; and before delivery, &s;everal of his creditors proceeded to execution again&s;t him. In a few days after delivery he made over the &s;almon to William For&s;yth, another merchant of the &s;ame town, in part pay|ment of a debt due to For&s;yth; who was in the knowledge that Bar|clay was in labouring circum&s;tances, and that the price of the &s;almon was not paid. Execution thickened more and more upon him, and he broke in ten days or a fortnight after the &s;almon was delivered to For&s;yth. From the&s;e circum&s;tances the court pre&s;umed an intention in Barclay to defraud Bighou&s;e: and con&s;idering that For&s;yth's pur|cha&s;e was not made <HI>bona fide,</HI> they found him liable to pay to Big|hou&s;e the value of the &s;almon <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mackay of Bighou&s;e contra William For&s;yth merchant in Cromarty, January 20. 1758.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. Reparation to which per&s;ons are intitled who are harmed in their rights or privileges.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to clear what need there may be of a court of equity with re&s;pect to the &s;ubject under con&s;ideration, it is proper to be pro|mi&s;ed, that regulations for preventing harm cannot be other but pro|hibitory; and con&s;equently cannot afford opportunity for the inter|po&s;ition of any court of law till the wrong be committed. To re&s;tore the party injured to his former &s;ituation, where that method is prac|ticable, will be preferred as the mo&s;t complete reparation. Thus goods &s;tolen are re&s;tored to the owner; and a di&s;po&s;ition of land procured by fear, or undue influence, is voided, in order that the di&s;poner may be re&s;tored to his property. But it &s;eldom happens that there is place for a remedy &s;o complete: it holds commonly, as expre&s;&s;ed in the Roman law, that <HI>factum infectum fieri nequit;</HI> and when that is the ca&s;e, the per&s;on injured, in&s;tead of being re&s;tored to his former &s;itua|tion, mu&s;t be contented with an equivalent in money.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion that occurs upon this &s;ubject is, Whether, in a claim for reparation, con&s;equential damage can be &s;tated. Con&s;e|quential damage is &s;ometimes certain, &s;ometimes uncertain. A hou&s;e of mine rented by a tenant, is unlawfully demoli&s;hed: the direct damage is the lo&s;s of the hou&s;e: the con&s;equential damage is the lo&s;s of the rent; which in this ca&s;e is certain, becau&s;e the unlawful act nece&s;&s;arily relieves the tenant from paying rent. Again, a man robs me of my hor&s;e: the direct damage is the hor&s;e lo&s;t to me: the con|&s;equential damage is the being prevented from making profit by
<PB N="78" REF="87">
him; which is not certain, becau&s;e the opportunity of making pro|fit might have failed me, and po&s;&s;ibly might have been neglected though it had offered. In the ca&s;e fir&s;t mentioned, the lo&s;s of the rent, being certain, comes properly under the e&s;timation of actual damage; and con&s;equently will never be excluded by a court of com|mon law. But con&s;equential damage that is uncertain, is not al|ways taken into the account. And the rea&s;on follows: It is naturally incumbent upon the man who claims reparation, to prove the extent of the damage he has &s;u&s;tained; which cannot be done with re&s;pect to con&s;equential damage, as far as uncertain. But as it is undoubt|edly a prejudice to be deprived of profit that probably might have been made; the claimant is in equity relieved of this proof, where the direct damage is the effect of a criminal act: every pre&s;umption is turned again&s;t the delinquent; and he is charged with every pro|bable article of profit, unle&s;s he can give convincing evidence that the profit claimed could not have been made. And this is conform|able to the rules of equity; for as the profits are rendered uncertain by a criminal act, the con&s;equences of this uncertainty ought to af|fect the delinquent, and not his party who is innocent. Here is a fair opportunity for the interpo&s;ition of equity. A court of common law cannot li&s;ten to any proof but what is complete, and cannot a|ward damages except as far as rendered certain by evidence. A court of equity, with re&s;pect to criminal acts, turns the uncertainty again&s;t the delinquent; and by that means affords complete reparation to the per&s;on injured. Thus, in a &s;puilzie, which is a claim for dama|ges in a civil court, founded on the violent ab&s;traction of moveable goods, the profit that might have been made by the cattle or hor&s;es carried off, termed <HI>violent profits,</HI> makes always an article in the e&s;ti|mation of damage. The rule is different where the damage is occa|&s;ioned by a culpable act only; for as there is nothing here to vary the rule of law, <HI>Quod affirmanti incumbit probatio,</HI> no article of profit will be &s;u&s;tained but what can be rendered certain by evidence. This, it is true, may po&s;&s;ibly be prejudicial to the per&s;on who is hurt by the culpable act: but <HI>humanum e&s;t errare;</HI> and it is more expedient that he &s;uffer &s;ome prejudice, than that men &s;hould be terrified from indu&s;try and activity, by a rigorous and vague claim <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In the Engli&s;h courts of common law there is no accurate di&s;tinction made between damage certain and uncertain. Damages are taxed by the jury, who give &s;uch damages as in con&s;cience they think &s;ufficient to make up the lo&s;s, without regarding any preci&s;e rule.</NOTE>. This doc|trine

Sir Lu|dovick Grant, who had a deputation from the Admiral of Scotland, mi&s;apprehending the bounds of his juri&s;diction, gave orders for &s;eizing the &s;hip as his property; and the&s;e orders were put in execu|tion after the &s;hip was refitted by Robert&s;on. As &s;oon as the mi&s;|take was di&s;covered, the &s;hip was redelivered. But Robert&s;on, who lo&s;t con&s;iderably by the delay, brought a proce&s;s again&s;t Sir Lu|dovick for damages, and obtained a decree<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">December 21. 1756.</NOTE> for a large &s;um, to which the direct damage amounted. It was con&s;idered, that the defendant's error was culpable in acting ra&s;hly without duly exa|mining the limits of his juri&s;diction, of which he might be ea&s;ily a&s;certained by in&s;pecting the Duke's title on record.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Powers of a Court of Equity to remedy what is imperfect in common law, with re&s;pect to protecting the weak of mind from harming them&s;elves by unequal bargains and irrational deeds.</HEAD>
<P>THE weakne&s;s and imbecillity of &s;ome men make them a fit prey for the crafty and de&s;igning. But as every deed, cove|nant, or tran&s;action, procured by undue influence, comes under the foregoing chapter, the pre&s;ent chapter is confined to ca&s;es where e|quity protects individuals from hurting them&s;elves by their own weakne&s;s and imbecillity, without the intervention of any craft or un|due influence. And here, though, for the &s;ake of commerce, utility will not li&s;ten to a complaint of inequality among <HI>majores, &s;cientes, et prudentes;</HI> yet the weak of mind ought to be excepted; becau&s;e &s;uch per&s;ons ought to be removed from commerce, and their tran&s;|actions be confined to what is &s;trictly nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and well-being. And this is ju&s;tly confining to the weak of mind a rule again&s;t inequality in bargains, which the Romans, ignorant of commerce, made general with re&s;pect to every per&s;on.</P>
<P>I begin with deeds granted by per&s;ons under age, who cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed mature in judgement. A reduction upon the head of mino|rity and le&s;ion, unknown in the common law, is an action &s;u&s;tain|ed by a court of equity for &s;etting a&s;ide any unequal tran&s;action done
<PB N="81" REF="90">
during nonage. But inequality ought not to be regarded in a deed that proceeds from a virtuous and rational motive, which would be a laudable deed in one of full age. I give the following examples. A young man under age, having no means of his own, is aliment|ed and educated by a near relation, till he happens to &s;ucceed to an opulent fortune. Full of gratitude, he grants to his benefactor a re|muneratory bond for a moderate &s;um, and dies without arriving to full age. A court of equity will never give countenance to the heir in attempting to reduce this bond; for gratitude is a moral duty, and the young man was in con&s;cience bound to make a grateful return. A court of equity, it is true, has not many opportunities to inforce the duty of gratitude, becau&s;e it can &s;eldom be brought under a general rule; but here a court of equity may &s;afely interpo&s;e to &s;upport a grateful return, the extent of which is a&s;certained by the young man him&s;elf. I put another ca&s;e. A man of an opulent fortune dies &s;ud|denly without making provi&s;ions for his younger children. His elde&s;t &s;on and heir &s;upplies this omi&s;&s;ion by giving &s;uitable provi|&s;ions, and dies under age. A third ca&s;e may be &s;uppo&s;ed, where the rational motive is not altogether &s;o cogent. A man of an opulent fortune dies &s;uddenly leaving a numerous family of children, all of the female &s;ex, without making provi&s;ions for them. A collateral heir-male &s;ucceeds, who &s;upplies this omi&s;&s;ion by giving &s;uitable provi&s;ions, but dies under age. A court of equity would deviate from the &s;pirit of its in&s;titution, if it &s;hould authori&s;e a reduction of &s;uch provi&s;ions by the granter's heir, upon the head of minority and le&s;ion. For a rational and laudable deed never can be le&s;ion in any proper &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ame doctrine is applicable to tho&s;e who have a natural imbe|cillity which continues for life. A tran&s;action made by &s;uch a per|&s;on is not voided by a court of equity, unle&s;s it appear irrational and the effect of imbecillity. Where this is the ca&s;e, it becomes indeed nece&s;&s;ary that a court of equity interpo&s;e, though there can be no ge|neral rule for direction.</P>
<P>The protection afforded by equity to the weak in mind, is ex|tended to &s;ave them from hurting them&s;elves by irrational &s;ettle|ments. The opinions of men with re&s;pect to the management of affairs, and the exerci&s;ing acts of property, are not le&s;s various than their faces: and as the world is &s;eldom agreed about what is right and wrong in &s;uch matters, there can be no rule for re&s;training the &s;ettlements of tho&s;e who are not remarkably weak, unle&s;s &s;uch &s;ettlements be not only irrational but ab&s;urd. But as the weak and facile are
<PB N="82" REF="91">
protected from unequal bargains, there is the &s;ame rea&s;on for pro|tecting them from ab&s;urd &s;ettlements. Take the following example. In a proce&s;s at the in&s;tance of a brother next of kin, for voiding a te&s;tament made by his decea&s;ed &s;i&s;ter in favour of a &s;tranger, it came out upon proof, that, &s;ome time before making the te&s;tament, the te&s;tatrix, being &s;eized with madne&s;s, was locked up; and that not long after making the te&s;tament her madne&s;s recurred, and continued till her death; that at the time of the te&s;tament &s;he was in a waver|ing &s;tate, &s;ometimes better, &s;ometimes wor&s;e; in &s;ome particulars ra|tional, in others little better than delirious, never perfectly &s;ound of mind. In particular, it appeared from the proof, that when in bet|ter health, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed much affection for her brother the pur&s;uer; but that, when the di&s;ea&s;e was more upon her, &s;he appeared to have &s;ome grudge or re&s;entment at him without any cau&s;e. The te&s;tament was holograph; and the &s;croll &s;he copied was furni&s;hed by the de|fendant, in who&s;e favour the te&s;tament was made, who had ready acce&s;s to her at all times, while her brother lived at a di&s;tance. In rea&s;oning upon this ca&s;e it was yielded, that the woman was capable of making a te&s;tament, and that the te&s;tament challenged might be effectual at common law. But then it was urged, That though a te&s;tament made in the condition of mind above de&s;cribed, preferring one relation before another, a &s;on before a father, or a &s;i&s;ter before a brother, might be &s;upported in equity as well as at common law; yet that the te&s;tament in que&s;tion, proceeding not from rational views, but from a di&s;ea&s;ed mind occa&s;ioning a cau&s;ele&s;s re&s;entment again&s;t the pur&s;uer, ought not to be &s;upported in equity, being a deed which the te&s;tatrix her&s;elf mu&s;t have been a&s;hamed of had &s;he recovered her health. Weight al&s;o was laid upon the following circum&s;tance, That the te&s;tament was made <HI>remotis arbitris,</HI> and kept a dead &s;ecret; which &s;howed the defendant's con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that had there been acce&s;s to the te&s;tatrix, &s;he would have been ea&s;ily diverted from making &s;o irra|tional a &s;ettlement. In this view, it was con&s;idered as a wrong in him to take from her, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, &s;uch an irrational deed; and con&s;equently, that he ought to be re&s;trained in equity from taking any benefit by it.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Powers of a court of equity to remedy what is imperfect in common law, with re&s;pect to the natural duty of be|nevolence.</HEAD>
<P>IN the introduction there was occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that the vir|tue of benevolence is by various connections converted into a du|ty; and that duties of this kind, being neglected by the common law, are inforced by a court of equity. This opens a wide field of equity, boundle&s;s in appearance; and which would be &s;o in reality as well as in appearance, were it not for one circum&s;tance, That the duty of be|nevolence is much more limited than the virtue. The virtue of benevo|lence may be exerci&s;ed by a great variety of good offices: it tends often to make additions to the po&s;itive happine&s;s of others, as well as to relieve them from di&s;tre&s;s or want. But ab&s;tracting from po&s;itive engagement, the duty of benevolence is, with re&s;pect to pecuniary intere&s;t, confi|ned to the latter. No connection, no &s;ituation, nor circum&s;tance, makes it my duty to increa&s;e the &s;tock of any per&s;on who has already a &s;ufficiency, or to make him <HI>locupletior,</HI> as termed in the Roman law. For even in the &s;tricte&s;t of all connections, that of parent and child, I feel not that I am in con&s;cience or in duty bound, to do more than to make my children independent, &s;o as to pre&s;erve them from want <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This propo&s;ition is illu&s;trated in the following ca&s;e. Mary Scot, daughter of Scot of Highche&s;ter, having, by unlucky circum&s;tances, been reduced to indigence, was alimented by her mother Lady Mary Drummond, at the rate of L. 20 yearly. Lady Mary, at the ap|proach of death, &s;ettled all her effects upon Mary Sharp, her daughter of another marriage, taking no other notice of her daughter Mary Scot, than the recommending her to the charity of Mary Sharp. After the mother's death, Mary Scot brought a proce&s;s for aliment again&s;t her &s;i&s;ter Mary Sharp, founded chiefly on the &s;aid recommendation. A proof was taken of the extent of the effects contained in the &s;ettlement to the defendant, which amounted to about L. 300 Sterling. It was pretty obvious, that no action either in law or equity could be found|ed on the recommendation, very different in its nature from an obligation or a burden. But then it was &s;tated, that the pur&s;uer, being very young when her father died, was educated by her mother to no &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s by which &s;he could gain a livelihood: and it occurred to the court, that though the <HI>patria pote&s;tas</HI> is &s;uch, that a peer may breed his &s;on a cobler, and af|ter &s;ettling him in bu&s;ine&s;s with a competent &s;tock, is relieved from all further aliment; yet if a &s;on be bred as a gentleman, without being in&s;tructed in any art that can gain him a farthing, he is intitled to be alimented for life; for otherwi&s;e a palpable ab&s;urdity will follow, That a man may &s;tarve his &s;on, or leave him to want or beggary. Thus Lady Mary Drummond, breeding her daughter to no bu&s;ine&s;s, was, by the law of nature, bound to aliment her for life, or at lea&s;t till &s;he &s;hould be otherwi&s;e provided for; and the pur&s;uer therefore being a creditor for this aliment, has a good action again&s;t her mother's repre&s;entatives. The court accordingly found the pur&s;uer intitled to an aliment of L. 12 Sterling yearly, and decerned again&s;t the de|fendant for the &s;ame.&mdash;8<HI>th March</HI> 1759, <HI>Mary Scot contra Mary Sharp.</HI></NOTE>: all beyond is left upon parental affection.

Here is a clear circum&s;cription of equity, as far as concerns the pre&s;ent chapter. A court of equity cannot force one man, whether by his labour or money, to add to the riches of another; becau&s;e, ab&s;tracting from a promi&s;e, no connection ever makes this a duty. What then is left for a court of equity, is, in certain circum&s;tances, to compel per&s;ons to &s;ave from mi&s;chief tho&s;e they are connected with, or to relieve them from want or di&s;tre&s;s. Benevolence, in this ca&s;e, is a &s;trong impul&s;e to afford relief; and, in this ca&s;e, benevo|lence, a&s;&s;uming the name of <HI>pity</HI> or <HI>compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> is, by a law in our na|ture, made a po&s;itive duty. In all other ca&s;es benevolence is a virtue only, not a duty: the exerci&s;e is left to our own choice; and the neglect is not puni&s;hed, though the practice is highly rewarded by the &s;atisfaction it affords. In this branch of our nature, a beautiful final cau&s;e is vi&s;ible: the benevolence of man, by want of ability, is con|fined within narrow bounds; and in order to make the mo&s;t of that &s;lender power he has of doing good, it is wi&s;ely directed where it is the mo&s;t u&s;eful, <HI>viz.</HI> to relieve others from di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>It appears then, that equity, &s;o far as concerns the duty of &s;erving others, is not extended beyond pity or compa&s;&s;ion. But it is cir|cum&s;cribed within &s;till narrower bounds; for compa&s;&s;ion, though a natural duty, is not adopted in its utmo&s;t extent by courts of equity. In many ca&s;es, this duty is too vague and undetermined to be reached by human laws; and a court of equity pretends not to interpo&s;e, but where the duty, being clear and preci&s;e, can be brought under gene|ral rules <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the introduction.</NOTE>. Some of the connections that occa&s;ion duty &s;o preci&s;e I &s;hall proceed to handle, confining my&s;elf to tho&s;e that are in &s;ome mea&s;ure involved in circum&s;tances; for the more &s;imple connections, &s;uch as that of parent and child, require little or no elucidation. Though all the duties of this kind that are inforced by a court of equity, belong to the principle of ju&s;tice; they may however be di|vided into different cla&s;&s;es. The pre&s;ent chapter is accordingly divi|ded
<PB N="85" REF="94">
into two &s;ections. In the fir&s;t are handled connections that make benevolence a duty when not prejudicial to our intere&s;t. In the &s;econd are handled connections that make benevolence a duty even again&s;t our intere&s;t. The&s;e connections are di&s;tingui&s;hable from each other &s;o clearly, as to prevent any confu&s;ion of ideas; and the foregoing order is cho&s;en, that we may pa&s;s gradually from the &s;lighter to the more intimate connections. To prompt a man to &s;erve tho&s;e with whom he is connected, requires not any extraordinary motive, when the good office thwarts not his own intere&s;t: any &s;light connection is &s;ufficient to make this a duty, and therefore &s;uch connections are fir&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. It requires a much &s;tronger connection, to make it our duty to be&s;tow upon another any part of our &s;ub&s;tance. Self-in|tere&s;t is not to be overcome but by connections of the mo&s;t intimate kind, which therefore are placed la&s;t in order.</P>

<P>THE connection I &s;hall fir&s;t take under con&s;ideration, is that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between a creditor and a cautioner. The nature of this engagement, when punctually fulfilled, demands &s;ome gratitude from the creditor. The cautioner, when he pays the debt, &s;uffers lo&s;s by the act of the creditor, though not by his fault; and it is the duty of the creditor, as far as con&s;i&s;tent with his own intere&s;t, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the cautioner in operating his relief again&s;t the principal debtor. He ought, in particular, to convey to the cautioner, the bond with the execution done upon it, in order that the cautioner may the more &s;peedily compel the principal debtor to relieve him. The law, fa|vouring this moral act, con&s;iders the money delivered to the creditor, not as payment, but as a valuable con&s;ideration for a&s;&s;igning his debt and execution to the cautioner. I cannot explain this better than in the words of Papinian, the mo&s;t eminent of all the writers upon the Roman law: <Q REND="inline">"Cum po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or unus, expediendi negotii cau&s;a, tributorum jure conveniretur; adver&s;us caeteros, quorum aeque praedia tenentur, ei, qui conventus e&s;t, actiones a fi&s;co prae|&s;tantur: &s;cilicet ut omnes pro modo praediorum pecuniam tri|buti conferant: nec inutiliter actiones prae&s;tantur tamet&s;i fi&s;cus pecuniam &s;uam reciperaverit, quia nominum venditorum pretium
<PB N="86" REF="95">
acceptum videtur <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 5. De cen&s;ibus.</NOTE>."</Q> From which con&s;ideration it evidently fol|lows, that this a&s;&s;ignment may be demanded and granted <HI>ex po&s;t facto,</HI> if the precaution be omitted when the money is paid.</P>
<P>From the &s;ame principle it al&s;o follows, that the creditor is bound to convey to the cautioner every &s;eparate &s;ecurity he has for the debt; and con&s;equently, that if the creditor di&s;charge or pa&s;s from his &s;epa|rate &s;ecurity, the cautioner, &s;o far as he &s;uffers thereby, hath an ex|ception in equity again&s;t payment.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve hi&s;torically, that there are many deci&s;ions of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, declaring the creditor not bound to grant the a&s;&s;ign|ment fir&s;t mentioned. The&s;e deci&s;ions, remote in point of time, will not be much regarded; becau&s;e the rules of equity lay formerly in greater ob&s;curity than at pre&s;ent. And there is an additional rea&s;on for di&s;regarding them, that they are not con&s;i&s;tent with others rela|ting to the &s;ame &s;ubject. If it be laid down as a rule, That the credi|tor is not bound to a&s;&s;ign his bond and execution, however beneficial &s;uch a&s;&s;ignment may be by giving the cautioner ready execution a|gain&s;t the principal debtor; it ought to follow, that neither is he bound to a&s;&s;ign any &s;eparate &s;ecurity: if it be not his duty to &s;erve the cautioner in the one ca&s;e, it cannot be his duty to &s;erve him in the other. And yet it is a rule e&s;tabli&s;hed in this court, That the cau|tioner, making payment of the debt, is intitled to every &s;eparate &s;e|curity of which the creditor is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. One is at no lo&s;s to di&s;cover the cau&s;e of this di&s;crepancy: when the que&s;tion is about a &s;eparate &s;ecurity upon which the cautioner's relief may wholly depend, the principle of equity makes a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion: its impre&s;&s;ion is &s;lighter when the que&s;tion is only about a&s;&s;igning the bond, which has no other effect but to &s;ave a formal proce&s;s.</P>
<P>It is of the greater con&s;equence to &s;ettle with preci&s;ion the equi|table rule that governs que&s;tions between the creditor and cautioner, becau&s;e upon it depends wholly, in my apprehen&s;ion, the mutual re|lief between co-cautioners. Of two cautioners bound for the &s;ame debt at different times, and in different deeds, one pays the debt up|on a di&s;charge without an a&s;&s;ignment: where is the legal founda|tion that intitles this man to claim the half from his fellow-caution|er? The being bound in different deeds affords no place for &s;uppo|&s;ing an implied &s;tipulation of mutual relief: nay, &s;uppo&s;ing them bound in the &s;ame deed, we are not from that &s;ingle circum&s;tance to imply a mutual con&s;ent for relief, but rather the contrary when the clau&s;e of mutual relief is omitted; for, in general, when an ob|vious
<PB N="87" REF="96">
clau&s;e is left out of a deed, it is natural to a&s;cribe the omi&s;&s;ion to de&s;ign rather than to forgetfulne&s;s. The principal debtor is <HI>ex mandato</HI> bound to relieve all his cautioners: but there is no medium at common law, by which one cautioner can demand relief from another. And with re&s;pect to equity, the connection of being bound for payment of the &s;ame debt, is too &s;light to intitle that cautioner who pays the whole debt, to be indemnified in part out of the goods of his fellow. It appears then, that the claim of mutual relief a|mong co-cautioners, can have no foundation other than the obliga|tion upon the creditor to a&s;&s;ign upon payment. This a&s;&s;ignment in the ca&s;e of a &s;ingle cautioner mu&s;t be total; in the ca&s;e of &s;everal mu&s;t be <HI>pro rata;</HI> becau&s;e the creditor is equally connected with each of them. The only difficulty is, that at this rate, there is no mu|tual relief unle&s;s an a&s;&s;ignment be actually given. But this difficul|ty is ea&s;ily &s;urmounted. We have &s;een above, that &s;uch a&s;&s;ignment may be granted <HI>ex po&s;t facto:</HI> hence it is the duty of the creditor to grant the a&s;&s;ignment at whatever time demanded; and if the credi|tor prove refractory, the law will interpo&s;e to hold an a&s;&s;ignment as granted, becau&s;e it ought to be granted. And this &s;uppletory or implied legal a&s;&s;ignment, is the true foundation of the mutual re|lief among co-cautioners, which obtains both in Scotland and Eng|land.</P>
<P>Utility al&s;o concurs to &s;upport this equitable claim: no &s;ituation with regard to law would be attended with more pernicious con&s;e|quences, than to permit a creditor to oppre&s;s one cautioner and re|lieve others: judges ought to be jealous of &s;uch arbitrary powers, which will generally be directed by bad motives; often by re&s;ent|ment, and, which is &s;till wor&s;e, more often by avarice. It is hap|py therefore for mankind, that two different principles coincide in matters of this kind, to put them upon a ju&s;t and &s;alutary footing.</P>
<P>The creditor, as has been &s;aid, being bound to all the cautioners equally, cannot legally give an a&s;&s;ignment to one of them in &s;uch terms as to intitle him to claim the whole from the other cautioners. In what terms then ought the a&s;&s;ignment to be granted? or when granted without limitation, what effect ought it to have in equity? This is a que&s;tion of &s;ome &s;ubtilty. To permit the a&s;&s;ignee to de|mand the whole from any &s;ingle co-cautioner, deducting only his own part of the debt, is unequal; becau&s;e it evidently gives the a&s;|&s;ignee an advantage over his fellow-cautioners. On the other hand, the a&s;&s;ignee is in a wor&s;e &s;ituation than any other of the cautioners, if he mu&s;t &s;ubmit to take from each of them &s;eparately his propor|tion
<PB N="88" REF="97">
of the debt: upon this plan, the cautioner who pays the debt, is forc'd to run the circuit of all his co-cautioners; and if one or two prove in&s;olvent, he mu&s;t renew the &s;uit again&s;t the re&s;t, to make up the proportions of tho&s;e who are deficient. To pre&s;erve therefore a real equality among the cautioners, every one of them again&s;t whom relief is claimed, ought to bear an equal proportion with the a&s;|&s;agnee. To explain this rule, I &s;uppo&s;e &s;ix cautioners bound in a bond for &s;ix hundred pounds. The fir&s;t paying the debt is intitled to claim the half from the &s;econd, who ought to be equally bur|dened with the fir&s;t. When the fir&s;t and &s;econd again attack the third, they have a claim again&s;t him each for a hundred pounds; which re&s;olves in laying the burden of two hundred pounds upon each;&mdash;and &s;o on till the whole cautioners be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. This method not only pre&s;erves equality, but avoids after-reckonings in ca&s;e of in|&s;olvency.</P>
<P>So far clear when relief can be directly obtained. But what if the a&s;&s;ignee be put to the trouble of adjudging for his relief? In that ca&s;e, the a&s;&s;ignment is a legal title to lead an adjudication for the whole debt. Equity is &s;atisfied, if, by virtue of the adjudication, no more be actually drawn out of the e&s;tate of any of the co-cau|tioners, than that co-cautioner is bound to contribute as above. And in leading the adjudication, not even the adjudger's own proportion of the debt ought to be deducted: it is a benefit to the other caution|ers that the &s;ecurity be as exten&s;ive as po&s;&s;ible; for it intitles the ad|judger to a greater proportion of the &s;ubject or price, in competition with extraneous creditors.</P>
<P>The &s;ame principles and conclu&s;ions are equally applicable to <HI>cor|rei debendi,</HI> where a number of debtors are bound conjunctly and &s;e|verally to one creditor. Equity requires the utmo&s;t impartiality in him to his debtors: if for his own ea&s;e he take the whole from one, he is bound to grant an a&s;&s;ignment preci&s;ely as in the ca&s;e of co-cautioners. Utility joins with equity to inforce this impartiality. And it makes no difference whether the <HI>correi debendi</HI> be bound for a civil debt or be bound <HI>ex delicto;</HI> for in both ca&s;es equally it is the duty of the creditor to act impartially, and in both ca&s;es equally uti|lity requires impartiality.</P>
<P>Another connection, of the &s;ame nature with the former, is that between one creditor who is infeft in two different tenements for his &s;ecurity, and another creditor who hath an infeftment on one of the tenements, of a later date. Here the two creditors are connected,
<PB N="89" REF="98">
by having the &s;ame debtor, and a &s;ecurity upon the &s;ame &s;ubject. Hence it follows, as in the former ca&s;e, that if the preferable credi|tor chu&s;e arbitrarily to draw his whole payment out of that &s;ubject in which the other creditor is infeft, the latter for his relief is intitled to have the preferable &s;ecurity a&s;&s;igned to him: which can be done upon the con&s;truction above mentioned; for the &s;um recovered by the preferable creditor out of the &s;ubject on which the other creditor is al&s;o infeft, is ju&s;tly under&s;tood to be advanced by the latter, be|ing a &s;um which he was intitled to, and mu&s;t have drawn had not the preferable creditor interpo&s;ed; and this &s;um is held to be the purcha&s;e-money of the &s;aid conveyance. This con&s;truction, pre&s;er|ving the preferable debt entire in the per&s;on of the &s;econd creditor, intitles him to draw payment of that debt out of the other tenement; and by this equitable con&s;truction, matters are re&s;tored to the &s;ame &s;tate as if the fir&s;t creditor had drawn his payment out of the &s;epa|rate &s;ubject, leaving the other entire for payment of the &s;econd credi|tor. Utility al&s;o, as &s;aid above, concurs to &s;upport this equitable claim.</P>
<P>It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary here to ob&s;erve, that a &s;uppo&s;ed conveyance, which may be &s;ufficient, as above mentioned, to found a claim of relief among co-cautioners, will not an&s;wer in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. In order to found an execution again&s;t land, there mu&s;t be an infeft|ment; and this infeftment mu&s;t be convey'd to the per&s;on who de|mands execution. Any ju&s;t or equitable con&s;ideration may be &s;uf|ficient to found a per&s;onal action; but even per&s;onal execution can|not proceed without a formal warrant, and &s;till le&s;s real execution.</P>
<P>But now, admitting it to be the duty of the preferable creditor to grant an a&s;&s;ignment, the que&s;tion is, To what extent? Whether ought the a&s;&s;ignment to have a total effect, or only to re&s;tore the di&s;appoint|ed creditor to that &s;ituation he would have been in, had the prefer|able creditor drawn his payment proportionally out of both &s;ub|jects? It will be made appear by and by, that the a&s;&s;ignment mu&s;t be confined to the latter effect in the ca&s;e of two &s;econdary creditors. But there is no equity to limit the a&s;&s;ignment in this manner, where there is no intere&s;t in oppo&s;ition but that of the debtor. He has no equitable intere&s;t to oppo&s;e a total a&s;&s;ignment; and the &s;econd creditor has an equitable claim to all the aid the fir&s;t creditor can af|ford him.</P>
<P>The rules of equity mu&s;t be the &s;ame in every country where law is cultivated. By the practice of England <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2. Chancery Ca&s;es 4.</NOTE>&punc; if the creditors &s;weep
<PB N="90" REF="99">
away the per&s;onal e&s;tate, the real e&s;tate will be charged for payment of the legacies. In this ca&s;e, the legatees need no a&s;&s;ignment to found their equitable claim again&s;t the heir who &s;ucceeds to the real e&s;tate.</P>
<P>We proceed to another connection, which is that between the pre|ferable creditor infeft on both tenements, and two &s;econdary credi|tors, one infeft in one of the tenements, and one in the other. The duty of the preferable or catholic creditor, with relation to the&s;e &s;e|condary creditors, cannot be doubtful, con&s;idering what is &s;aid a|bove. Equity as well as expediency bars him from arbitrary mea|&s;ures. He is equally connected with his two fellow-creditors, and he mu&s;t act impartially between them. The regular method is, that he draw his payment proportionally out of both tenements; but if, for his own ea&s;e or conveniency, he chu&s;e to draw the whole out of one, the po&s;tponed creditor is intitled to an a&s;&s;ignment; not in|deed total, which would be an arbitrary act, but proportional, &s;o as to intitle the a&s;&s;ignee to draw the &s;ame &s;um out of the other &s;ubject, which he would have drawn out of his own, had the preferable cre|ditor contented him&s;elf with a proportional draught out of both &s;ub|jects. I need &s;carce mention, that the &s;ame rule which obtains in the ca&s;e of &s;econdary creditors, mu&s;t equally obtain among purcha&s;ers of different parcels of land, which before the purcha&s;e were all <HI>in cumulo</HI> burdened with an infeftment of annualrent. The &s;ame rule of equity is acknowledged in England. A man grants a rent-charge out of all his lands, and afterward &s;ells them by parcels to diver&s;e per&s;ons: the grantee of the rent-charge levies his whole rent from one of the&s;e pur|cha&s;ers: this purcha&s;er &s;hall be ea&s;ed in equity by a contribution from the re&s;t of the purcha&s;ers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abridg. ca&s;es in equity, cap. 18. &s;ect. A. &sect; 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A ca&s;e connected with that la&s;t handled mu&s;t not be overlooked, becau&s;e it will throw light upon the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. Let it be &s;up|po&s;ed, that the catholic or preferable creditor purcha&s;es one of the &s;econdary debts; will this vary the rule of equity? This purcha&s;e in it&s;elf lawful, is not prohibited by any &s;tatute, and therefore mu&s;t have its effect. The connection here between the creditors is by no means &s;o intimate, as to oblige any one of them, at the expence of his own intere&s;t, to &s;erve the others. There is no rule in equity to bar the catholic creditor from drawing full payment of the &s;econdary debt out of the tenement which it burdens, re&s;erving his catholic debt to be made effectual out of the other tenement; though of con|&s;equence the &s;econdary creditor upon that tenement is totally di&s;ap|pointed.
<PB N="91" REF="100">
This &s;econdary creditor has no claim for an a&s;&s;ignment, total or partial, when the intere&s;t of the catholic creditor &s;tands in oppo&s;ition. But here the connection among the parties mu&s;t, in my apprehen&s;ion, have the following equitable operation, that the catho|lic creditor, by virtue of his purcha&s;e, cannot draw more than the &s;um he paid for it. Equity in this ca&s;e will not allow the one to pro|fit by the other's lo&s;s. But a hint here mu&s;t &s;uffice; becau&s;e the point belongs more properly to another head <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Immediately below, &s;ect. 2. art. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The following ca&s;e proceeds upon the principle above laid down. The hu&s;band, on the marriage, charged the lands with a rent-charge for a jointure to his wife, and afterward devi&s;ed part of the&s;e lands to the wife. After the hu&s;band's death the heir prayed that the lands devi&s;ed to the wife might bear their proportion of the rent-charge: the bill was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e the grantee of the rent-charge may di|&s;train in all or any part of the lands for her rent; and there is no e|quity to abridge her remedy <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Vern. 347.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If the catholic creditor, after the exi&s;tence of both &s;econdary debts, renounce his infeftment with re&s;pect to one of the tenements, which makes a clear fund for the &s;econdary creditor &s;ecured upon that te|nement; &s;uch renunciation ought to have no effect in equity again&s;t the other &s;econdary creditor, becau&s;e it is an arbitrary deed, and a direct breach of that impartiality which the catholic creditor is bound to ob&s;erve with relation to the &s;econdary creditors. It is in effect the &s;ame with granting a total a&s;&s;ignment to one of the &s;econdary creditors again&s;t the other.</P>
<P>In every one of the ca&s;es above mentioned, the catholic creditor is equally connected with each of the &s;econdary creditors, and upon that account is bound to act impartially between them. But this rule of equity cannot take place where the connections are unequal. It holds here as among blood-relations; tho&s;e who are neare&s;t to me are intitled to a preference in my favour. The following ca&s;e will be a &s;ufficient illu&s;tration. A man takes a bond of borrowed money with a cautioner; obtains afterward an infeftment from the princi|pal debtor as an additional &s;ecurity; and la&s;t of all, another creditor for his &s;ecurity obtains infeftment upon the &s;ame &s;ubject. Here the fir&s;t-mentioned creditor has two different means for obtaining pay|ment: he may apply to the cautioner, or he may apply to the land in which he is infeft. He proceeds to execution again&s;t the land, by which he cuts out the &s;econd creditor. Is he bound to grant an a&s;|&s;ignment
<PB N="92" REF="101">
to the &s;econd creditor again&s;t the cautioner, total or partial? The &s;econd creditor is in this ca&s;e not intitled to demand an a&s;&s;ign|ment: on the contrary, the preferable creditor, taking payment from the cautioner, is bound to give him a total a&s;&s;ignment; becau&s;e he is more intimately connected with the cautioner than with the &s;econd creditor. A cautionary engagement is an act of pure benevolence; and when a creditor lays hold of this engagement to oblige one man to pay another's debt, this connection makes it evidently the duty of the creditor to aid the cautioner with an a&s;&s;ignment, in or|der to repair his lo&s;s; and it proceeds from the &s;ame intimacy of con|nection, that, as above mentioned, he is obliged to include in this a&s;&s;ignment every &s;eparate &s;ecurity he has for the debt. It is his du|ty accordingly to convey to the cautioner the real &s;ecurity he got from the principal debtor. Nor is the intere&s;t of the &s;econd creditor regarded in oppo&s;ition; for he is no other way connected with the preferable creditor, but that both of them are creditors to the &s;ame per&s;on, and that both of them are infeft on the &s;ame &s;ubject for &s;e|curity.</P>
<P>A que&s;tion of great importance that has frequently been canva&s;&s;ed in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, appears to depend upon the principles above &s;et forth. The que&s;tion is this, Whether a tenant in tail be bound to extingui&s;h the annual burdens ari&s;ing during his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;o as to tran&s;mit to the heirs of entail the e&s;tate in as good condition as when he received it? To treat this que&s;tion accurately, we mu&s;t be|gin with con&s;idering how the common law &s;tands. In the fir&s;t place, feu-duties, ce&s;s, and teind, are <HI>debita fructuum,</HI> and at common law afford an action for payment again&s;t every per&s;on who levies the rents, and again&s;t a tenant in tail in particular. With re&s;pect then to the foregoing articles, there is no occa&s;ion for equity: the common law burdens every tenant in tail with what of them become due during his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The entailer's per&s;onal debts are not a burden upon the fruits, but only upon the heirs of entail per&s;onally; and therefore the forego|ing medium for making the tenant in tail liable to relieve the heirs of entail of the current intere&s;t, fails here; and the que&s;tion is, Whether there be any other medium &s;ubjecting him at common law? We mu&s;t &s;eparate from this que&s;tion, the divi&s;ion of burdens between heir and executor. If a tenant in tail leave any moveable e&s;tate, it will no doubt be charged at common law with the arrears of intere&s;t, and with every moveable &s;um, principal or intere&s;t. But &s;uppo&s;ing that no moveable e&s;tate is left, and that the tenant in tail dies, leaving
<PB N="93" REF="102">
a land-e&s;tate of his own, de&s;cending to a different &s;eries of heirs who do not repre&s;ent the entailer: in this ca&s;e, the arrears of intere&s;t ari|&s;ing from the entailer's debts, mu&s;t, with the principal, remain a debt upon the entailed e&s;tate at common law; unle&s;s it can be made out, that the tenant in tail became bound to relieve the heirs of entail of the&s;e arrears, in which ca&s;e the arrears will be a charge upon his own e&s;tate.</P>
<P>An heir in a fee-&s;imple is&punc; no doubt, liable to the debts of his pre|dece&s;&s;or, and every heir is &s;o liable &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. But this obligation re&s;pects the creditors only, and affords no relief to one heir again&s;t another either for principal or intere&s;t. Does an entail make a differ|ence at common law? A tenant in tail po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the rents: but the&s;e rents are his own property ju&s;t as much as if the e&s;tate were a fee-&s;imple; and the con&s;uming rents belonging to him&s;elf cannot &s;ub|ject him as tenant in tail more than if his e&s;tate were a fee-&s;imple. Hence it appears clear, that at common law a tenant in tail is not bound to relieve the heirs of entail of any growing burden, unle&s;s what is a <HI>debitum fructuum.</HI></P>
<P>A court of equity, le&s;s confined than a court of common law, finds that this ca&s;e is re&s;olvable into one above determined, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>correi debendi,</HI> where &s;everal debtors are conjunctly bound for pay|ment of one debt. There is no other difference between this ca&s;e and heirs of entail, but that the former are all of them liable at the &s;ame time, whereas the latter are only liable &s;ucce&s;&s;ively for payment of the entailer's debts, one after another; which makes no difference either in equity or in expediency, the &s;ame impartiality being requi|red of the creditor with re&s;pect to both. While the debt &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, the creditor is bound to lay the burden of his intere&s;t upon each heir equally; and con&s;equently each heir is bound to pay the intere&s;t that ari&s;es during his time. And if the principal be demanded, the heir who pays is only intitled to an a&s;&s;ignment of the principal &s;um, and of the intere&s;t that &s;hall ari&s;e after his own death. This rule accor|dingly obtains in England, as where a proprietor of land, after char|ging it with a &s;um of money, devi&s;es it to one for life, remainder to another in fee. Equity will compel the tenant for life to pay the ar|rears due on the rent-charge, that all may not fall upon the remain|der man <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Chancery ca&s;es 223.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A tenant by curte&s;y is, like a tenant in tail, bound to extingui&s;h the current burdens. The curte&s;y is e&s;tabli&s;hed by cu&s;tomary law; and a court of equity is intitled to &s;upply any defect in law, whether writ|ten

The law, by authori&s;ing the hu&s;band's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the wife's e&s;tate, intends no more but to give him the enjoyment of it for life, without wa&s;te, con|fining him to act like a <HI>bonus paterfamilias</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Decreed, Home, Jan. 3. 1717, Anna Monteith.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The following ca&s;e &s;eems to require the interpo&s;ition of a court of equity; and yet whether its powers reach &s;o far is doubtful. A man a&s;&s;igns to a relation of his L. 500 contained in a bond, without power of revocation, re&s;erving only his own liferent. Many years after, forgetting the a&s;&s;ignment, he makes a will, naming this &s;ame rela|tion his executor and re&s;iduary legatee, bequeathing in the te&s;tament the fore&s;aid bond of L. 500 to another relation. The te&s;tator's ef|fects, ab&s;tracting from the bond, not exceeding in value L. 500, it becomes to the executor nominate a matter indifferent, whether he accept the te&s;tament, or betake him&s;elf to his own bond. But it is not indifferent to others; for if he undertake the office of executor, he mu&s;t convey the bond to the &s;pecial legatee; if he cling to the bond, rejecting the office, the te&s;tament falls to the ground, and the next of kin will take the effects, leaving nothing to the &s;pecial legatee. The intere&s;t of others ought not to depend on the arbitrary will of the executor nominate; and yet, as far as appears, there is no place here for the interpo&s;ition of equity. The privilege of accepting or reject|ing a right no man can be deprived of; and, admitting this pri|vilege, the con&s;equences that follow &s;eem to be out of the reach of equity.</P>
<P>Land-e&s;tates that are conterminous, form &s;uch a connection be|tween the proprietors, as to make certain acts of benevolence their duty, which belong to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. To &s;ave my ground from water flowing upon it from a neighbouring field, a court of equity will intitle me to repair a bulwark within that field, provided the re|paration damage not the proprietor <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 2. &sect; 5. in &s;ine, de aqua, et aquae pluviae areen.</NOTE>. The following is a &s;imilar ca&s;e. The cour&s;e of a rivulet which &s;erves my mill happens to be diverted, a torrent having filled with &s;tones or mud the channel in my neighbour's ground above. I will be permitted to remove the ob&s;truction though in my neighbour's property, in order to re|&s;tore the rivulet to its natural channel.

The rea&s;on is given above, That equity ne|ver obliges any man, whether by acting or &s;uffering, to increa&s;e the riches of another. Thus the Earl of Eglinton having built a mill upon the river of Irvine, and &s;tretched a dam-dike cro&s;s the channel, which occa&s;ioned a re&s;tagnation to the prejudice of a &s;uperior mill, Fairly the proprietor of this mill brought a proce&s;s, complaining that his mill was hurt by the back-water, and concluding that the Earl's dam-dike be demoli&s;hed, or &s;o altered as to give a free cour&s;e to the river.

<HEAD>SECT. II. Connections that make benevolence a duty even again&s;t our intere&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>THe&s;e connections mu&s;t be very intimate; for, as ob&s;erved in the beginning of the pre&s;ent chapter, it requires a much &s;tronger connection to oblige us to be&s;tow upon another any portion of our &s;ub&s;tance, than merely to do a good office which takes nothing from us. The bulk of the&s;e connections, though extremely various, may, I imagine, be brought under the following heads. 1&s;t Connections that intitle a man to have his lo&s;s made up out of our gain. 2d, Connections that intitle a man who is not, properly &s;peaking, a lo|&s;er, to partake of our gain. 3d, Connections that intitle one who is a lo&s;er to a recompence from one who is not a gainer.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ART. I.</HI> Connections that intitle a man to have his lo&s;s made up out of our gain.</HEAD>
<P>No per&s;onal connection, however intimate, &s;uppo&s;ing even that of parent and child, can make it an act of ju&s;tice, that one who
<PB N="96" REF="105">
is a gainer &s;hould repair the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by another, unle&s;s there be al&s;o &s;ome connection between the lo&s;s and gain; and this connec|tion is a capital circum&s;tance in the pre&s;ent &s;peculation. The con|nections hitherto mentioned relate to per&s;ons; this relates to things. If, for example, I lay out my money for meliorating a &s;ubject which I con&s;ider to be my own, but which is afterward di&s;cover|ed to be the property of another; my lo&s;s in this ca&s;e is intimate|ly connected with his gain, becau&s;e in effect my money comes in|to his pocket.</P>
<P>The connection between the lo&s;s and gain may be more or le&s;s intimate: and its different degrees of intimacy ought to be care|fully noted; becau&s;e it is rea&s;onable to pre&s;ume, what will be found true by induction, that where-ever it becomes a man's duty to apply his gain for repairing another's lo&s;s, there mu&s;t be an intimate connection between lo&s;s and gain. When this connection is found in the highe&s;t degree, there is &s;carce requi&s;ite any other circum&s;tance to found the duty: in its lower degrees no duty a|ri&s;es, unle&s;s the per&s;ons be otherwi&s;e &s;trongly connected. Proceed|ing then to trace the&s;e degrees, the lowe&s;t I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention, is where the lo&s;s and gain are connected by their relation to the &s;ame &s;ubject. For example, a man purcha&s;es at a low rate one of the preferable debts upon a bankrupt e&s;tate; and upon a &s;ale of the e&s;tate draws more than the tran&s;acted &s;um: he gains while his fellow-creditors lo&s;e con&s;iderably. The next degree going upward, is where my gain is the occa&s;ion of another's lo&s;s. For example, a merchant fore&s;eeing a &s;carcity, purcha&s;es all the corn he can find in the neighbourhood, with a view to make great profit: before he o|pens his granaries, I import a large cargo from abroad, parcelling it out at a moderate price, under what my brother-merchant paid for his cargo; by which means he lo&s;es con&s;iderably. The third, pretty much upon a level with the former, is where another's lo&s;s is the oc|ca&s;ion of my gain. For example, my &s;hip loaded with corn proceeds, in company with another, to a port where there is a &s;carcity: the o|ther &s;hip being foundered in a &s;torm, and the cargo lo&s;t, my cargo by that means draws a better price. The fourth connection is more intimate, the lo&s;s and the gain proceeding from the &s;ame cau&s;e. In the ca&s;e la&s;t mentioned, &s;uppo&s;e the weaker ve&s;&s;el, da&s;hed again&s;t the other in a &s;torm, is &s;unk: here the &s;ame cau&s;e by which the one pro|prietor lo&s;es, proves beneficial to the other. The la&s;t connection I &s;hall mention, and the complete&s;t, is where that which is lo&s;t by the one is gained by the other; or, in other words, where the money of
<PB N="97" REF="106">
which the one is deprived is converted to the other's benefit. This is the ca&s;e fir&s;t of all mentioned, of money laid out by a <HI>bona fide po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;or,</HI> in meliorating a &s;ubject which is afterward claimed by the pro|prietor. The money that the former lo&s;es is gained by the latter.</P>
<P>A famous maxim of the Roman law, <HI>Quod nemo debet locupletari ali|ena jactura,</HI> belongs to this article: and in order to a&s;certain, if it can be done, what are the connections that make it the duty of one man to part with his gain for repairing another's lo&s;s, I &s;hall begin with a commentary upon that maxim. The fir&s;t ob&s;ervation is, That it is expre&s;&s;ed ab&s;tractly, as holding true in general, without di&s;tinction of per&s;ons; and therefore that the duty it e&s;tabli&s;hes mu&s;t be founded upon a real connection, independent altogether of per&s;onal connec|tions. Which leads us to examine what that real connection mu&s;t be. <HI>Nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura,</HI> or, No per&s;on ought to profit <HI>by</HI> another's lo&s;s, implies a connection between the lo&s;s and the gain: it implies that the gain ari&s;es <HI>by</HI> the lo&s;s, or <HI>by means</HI> of the lo&s;s. Taking therefore the maxim literally, it ought to take place where-ever the gain is occa&s;ioned by the lo&s;s, or perhaps occa|&s;ions the lo&s;s; which certainly is not good law. My &s;hip loaded with corn proceeds, along with another, to a port where there is a &s;carcity. The other &s;hip being lo&s;t in a &s;torm, my cargo by that means draws a better price: I am benefited by another's lo&s;s. A|gain, two ve&s;&s;els loaded with corn are da&s;hed again&s;t each other in a &s;torm, and the weaker is &s;unk; by which means the cargo in the o|ther &s;ells at a higher price. In both examples, the &s;ame cau&s;e that de&s;troys the one merchant is profitable to the other: yet no man who in &s;uch circum&s;tances makes profit, finds him&s;elf bound in con&s;cience to be&s;tow his profit upon repairing the other's lo&s;s. It appears then that this maxim, like mo&s;t general maxims, is apt to mi&s;lead by be|ing too comprehen&s;ive. Reflecting upon this &s;ubject, we find, that nothing which a man acquires by his own means, or by accident, however connected with the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by another, will ever, in|dependent of &s;ome per&s;onal connection, bind him to make up that lo&s;s out of his gain. The only real connection that &s;ingly binds him, is where another's money is converted to his u&s;e. This circum|&s;tance, though without any intention to benefit him, will bind him in con&s;cience to make up that other's lo&s;s as far as he him&s;elf is a gainer. Here the maxim, <HI>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura,</HI> ta|ken in its &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, is applicable; and the &s;ingle ca&s;e, &s;o far as I under&s;tand, where it is applicable. The mo&s;t noted ca&s;e of this kind is where the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a &s;ubject which he <HI>bona &s;ide</HI> con&s;iders to be
<PB N="98" REF="107">
his own, lays out his money on reparations and meliorations, intend|ing nothing but his own benefit: the true proprietor claims the &s;ub|ject in a proce&s;s, and prevails: he profits by the meliorations, and the money be&s;towed on the&s;e meliorations is converted to his u&s;e. Every one in that ca&s;e mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of a hard&s;hip that requires a remedy; and it mu&s;t be the wi&s;h of every di&s;intere&s;ted per&s;on, that the <HI>bona fide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or</HI> be relieved from this hard&s;hip. That the com|mon law affords no relief, will be evident at fir&s;t &s;ight: the labour and money of the <HI>bona fide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or</HI> is &s;unk in the &s;ubject, and has no longer any &s;eparate exi&s;tence upon which to found a <HI>rei vindicatio:</HI> the proprietor at the &s;ame time, in claiming the &s;ubject, does no more but exerci&s;e his own right, which cannot &s;ubject him per&s;onally to any demand at the in&s;tance of the <HI>bona fide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</HI> If then there be a remedy, it can have no other foundation but equity; and that there is a remedy in equity will appear from the following con&s;idera|tions. Man being a fallible creature, &s;ociety would be an uncom|fortable &s;tate were individuals di&s;po&s;ed in every ca&s;e to take advan|tage of the mi&s;takes and errors of others. But the author of our na|ture has more harmoniou&s;ly adju&s;ted its different branches to each o|ther. To make it a law in our nature, never to take advantage of er|ror in any ca&s;e, would be giving too much indulgence to indolence and remi&s;&s;ion of mind, tending to make us neglect the improvement of our rational faculties. On the other hand, to make it lawful to take advantage of error in every ca&s;e, would be too rigorous, con&s;i|dering how difficult it is for a man to be always upon his guard. The author of our nature has happily moulded it &s;o as to avoid the&s;e extremes. No man is con&s;cious of wrong when he takes ad|vantage of an error committed by another to &s;ave him&s;elf from lo&s;s: if there mu&s;t be a lo&s;s, natural ju&s;tice dictates, that it ought to re&s;t upon the per&s;on who has committed an error, however innocently, rather than upon him who has been careful to avoid all error. But <HI>in lucro captando,</HI> the moral &s;en&s;e teaches a different le&s;&s;on: every one is con&s;cious of wrong, when an error is laid hold of to make gain by it. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of inju&s;tice, when &s;uch advantage is taken, is indeed inferior in degree, but the &s;ame in kind with the in|ju&s;tice of robbing an innocent per&s;on of his goods or of his reputation. This doctrine is &s;upported by utility as well as by ju&s;tice. Indu&s;try ought to be encouraged; and chance as much as po&s;&s;ible ought to be excluded from all dealings, in order that individuals may promi&s;e to them&s;elves the fruits of their own indu&s;try. This affords a fre&s;h in&s;tance of that beautiful harmony which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the inter|nal
<PB N="99" REF="108">
and external con&s;titution of man. A regular chain of cau&s;es and effects, leaving little or nothing to accident, is advantageous exter|nally by promoting indu&s;try, and is not le&s;s &s;o internally by the de|light it affords the human mind. No &s;cene is more di&s;gu&s;tful than to &s;ee all things going on by chance, without order or connec|tion. When a court of equity therefore pre&s;erves to every man, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the fruits of his own indu&s;try; &s;uch proceeding, by rectifying the di&s;orders of chance, is authori&s;ed by utility as well as by ju&s;tice. And hence it is a principle of morality, founded both on the nature of man and on the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, That we ought not to make gain by another's error.</P>
<P>This principle is directly applicable to the ca&s;e above mentioned. The titles of land-property being intricate, and often uncertain, in|&s;tances are frequent, where a man in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of land, the property of another, is led by unavoidable error to con&s;ider it as belonging to him&s;elf: his money is be&s;tow'd without he&s;itation in repairing and meliorating the &s;ubject. Equity will not permit the true owner to profit by &s;uch mi&s;take, and in effect to pocket the money of the inno|cent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and a court of equity interpo&s;es to oblige the owner to make up the lo&s;s as far as he is <HI>locupletior.</HI> Thus the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a tenement, having, upon the faith and belief of its being his own, made con&s;iderable meliorations, was, after voiding his title, found intitled to claim from the proprietor the expence of &s;uch meliorations as were profitable to him by rai&s;ing the rent of his tenement <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, January 18. 1676, Binning contra Brother&s;tanes.</NOTE>. In all ca&s;es of this kind, it can be qualified in the &s;tricte&s;t manner, that what is lo&s;t to the one accrues to the other. The maxim then mu&s;t be under&s;tood in this limited &s;en&s;e; for no connection between the lo&s;s and gain inferior in degree to this, will, independent of per&s;onal connections, be a &s;ufficient foundation for a claim in equity again&s;t the per&s;on who gains, to make up the other's lo&s;s.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;ubject meliorated to have peri&s;hed before bring|ing the action, is the proprietor notwith&s;tanding liable? I an&s;wer, That where equity makes benevolence a duty to tho&s;e who benefit us without intending it, it is not &s;ufficient that there has been gain one time or other: it is implied in the nature of the claim, that there mu&s;t be gain at the time of the demand; for if there be no gain at pre&s;ent, there is no &s;ubject out of which the lo&s;s can be made up.</P>
<P>It will not be thought an unnece&s;&s;ary digre&s;&s;ion to ob&s;erve a pecu|liarity in the Roman law with re&s;pect to this matter. As that law
<PB N="100" REF="109">
&s;tood originally, the <HI>bona fide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or</HI> had no claim for his expences. This did not proceed from ignorance of equity, but from want of a <HI>for|mula</HI> to authori&s;e the action; for at fir&s;t when brieves or forms of ac|tion were invented <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;torical law-tracts, tract 8.</NOTE>, this claim was not thought of. But an excep|tion was &s;oon thought of to intitle the <HI>bona fide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or</HI> to retain the &s;ubject, till he got payment of his expence: and this exception the judges could have no difficulty to &s;u&s;tain, becau&s;e exceptions were not &s;ubjected to any <HI>formula.</HI> The inconvenient re&s;traint of the&s;e <HI>formulae</HI> was in time broke through, and <HI>actiones in factum,</HI> or <HI>upon the ca&s;e,</HI> were introduced, which were not confined to any <HI>formula.</HI> Af|ter this innovation, the &s;ame equity that gave an exception, produced al&s;o an <HI>actio in factum;</HI> and the <HI>bona fide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or</HI> was made &s;ecure as to his expences in all ca&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> by an exception while he remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and by an action if he happened to lo&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Another ca&s;e, differing nothing from the former in effect though con&s;iderably in its circum&s;tances, is where, upon a fictitious mandate, one purcha&s;es my goods, or borrows my money, for the u&s;e of another. That other is not liable <HI>ex mandato,</HI> becau&s;e he gave no commi&s;&s;ion: but if I can prove that the money or goods were actually applied for his u&s;e, equity affords me a claim again&s;t him, as far as he is a gainer. Thus, in an action for payment of merchant-goods purcha&s;ed in name of the defendant, and applied to his u&s;e, the defendant in&s;i&s;ted, that he had given no commi&s;&s;ion; and that if his name was u&s;ed without his authority, he could not be liable. <Q REND="inline">"It was decreed, That the goods being applied to the defen|dant's u&s;e, he was liable, unle&s;s he could prove that he paid the price to the per&s;on who be&s;poke the goods <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, February 20. 1669, Bruce contra Stanhope.</NOTE>."</Q> This ca&s;e, like the former, re&s;ts entirely upon the real connection between the lo&s;s and gain, independent of which there was no connection be|tween the parties. And in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, perhaps more clearly than in the former, every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that the man who reaps the benefit is in duty bound to repair the other's lo&s;s. And hence the action <HI>de in rem ver&s;o,</HI> the name of which we borrow from the Romans. In a ca&s;e preci&s;ely &s;imilar, the court inclined to &s;u&s;tain it relevant to a&s;&s;oilzie or acquit the defendant, that the goods were gifted to him by the per&s;on who purcha&s;ed them in his name. But as donation is not pre&s;umed, he was found liable, becau&s;e he could not bring evidence of the alledged donation <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">July 1726, Hawthorn contra Urquhart.</NOTE>. Upon the &s;uppo&s;ition
<PB N="101" REF="110">
of a gift, it could not well be &s;pecified that the de&s;endant was <HI>locu|pletior:</HI> a man will &s;pend liberally what he con&s;iders as a pre&s;ent, though he would not lay out his money upon the purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>Having endeavoured to a&s;certain, with all po&s;&s;ible accuracy, that degree of connection between the lo&s;s and gain, which is requi&s;ite to afford a relief in equity, by obliging the per&s;on who gains to make up the other's lo&s;s, I proceed to a&s;certain the preci&s;e meaning of lo&s;s and gain as under&s;tood in the maxim. And the fir&s;t doubt that occurs is, Whether the term <HI>locupletior</HI> comprehend every real benefit, prevention of lo&s;s as well as a po&s;itive increa&s;e of fortune; or whether it be confined to the latter. I explain my&s;elf by examples. When a <HI>bona fide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or</HI> rears a new edifice upon another man's ground, this is a po&s;itive acce&s;&s;ion to the &s;ubject, which makes the proprietor <HI>locupletior</HI> in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word. But it may happen that the money laid out by the <HI>bona fide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or</HI> is directed to prevent lo&s;s; as where he fortifies the bank of a river again&s;t its incroachments, where he &s;upports a tottering edifice, or where he tran&s;acts a claim that threatened to carry off the property. Is the maxim applicable to ca&s;es of this nature, where lo&s;s is only prevent|ed without any po&s;itive increa&s;e of wealth or fortune? When a work is done that prevents lo&s;s, the &s;ubject is thereby improved and made of greater value. A bulwark that prevents the incroachments of a river, makes the land &s;ell at a higher price; and a real acce&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as a hou&s;e built, or land inclo&s;ed, will not do more. The only dif|ference is, that a po&s;itive acce&s;&s;ion makes a man richer than he for|merly was; a work done to prevent lo&s;s makes him only richer than he would have been had the work been left undone. This dif|ference is too &s;light to have any effect in equity. The proprietor gains by both equally; and in both ca&s;es equally he will feel him|&s;elf bound in ju&s;tice to make up the lo&s;s out of his gain. A <HI>bona fide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or</HI> who claims money laid out by him to &s;upport a tottering edifice, is <HI>certans de damno evitando,</HI> as well as where he claims money laid out upon meliorations; and the proprietor claiming the &s;ubject, is <HI>certans de lucro captando</HI> in the one ca&s;e as well as in the other. But in this competition, equity prefers the claim of him who is <HI>certans de damno evitando;</HI> for, as ob&s;erved above, there is in human nature a clear &s;en&s;e of wrong, where a man avails him&s;elf of an error to make profit at another's expence. Nor does the principle of utility make any di&s;tinction. It is a great object in &s;ociety, to rectify the di&s;orders of chance, and to pre&s;erve to every man, as much as po&s;|&s;ible, the fruits of his own indu&s;try; in which view, it makes no
<PB N="102" REF="111">
difference, whether a man's indu&s;try has been applied to prevent lo&s;s, or to make a real acce&s;&s;ion to his fortune. In the ca&s;es accordingly that have occurred, I find no di&s;tinction made; and in tho&s;e which follow there was no benefit but what aro&s;e from preventing lo&s;s. A &s;hip being ran&s;omed from a privateer, every per&s;on benefited mu&s;t contribute a proportion of the ran&s;om <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, June 29. 1710, Ritchie contra Lord Salton.</NOTE>.

<P>From what is &s;aid, it may po&s;&s;ibly be thought, that the foregoing rule of equity is applicable where-ever it can be &s;ub&s;umed, that the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by one has accrued to the benefit of another. But this will be found a ra&s;h conclu&s;ion, when it is con&s;idered, that one may be benefited without being in any proper &s;en&s;e <HI>locupletior,</HI> or a gain|er upon the whole. I give an example. A man erecting a large te|nement in a borough, becomes bankrupt by over&s;tretching his cre|dit. This new tenement, being the chief part of his &s;ub&s;tance, is adjudged by his creditors for &s;ums beyond the value. In the mean time, the trade&s;men and the furni&s;hers of materials for the building, tru&s;ting to a claim in equity, forbear to adjudge. They are lo&s;ers to the extent of their work and furni&s;hings; and the adjudgers are in one &s;en&s;e <HI>locupletiores,</HI> as by means of the tenement they will draw perhaps ten &s;hillings in the pound in&s;tead of five. Are the ad|judgers then, in terms of the maxim, bound to yield this profit, in order to pay the workmen and furni&s;hers? By no means. For here the benefit is partial only, and produceth not upon the whole actual profit: on the contrary, the adjudgers, even after this benefit, are e|qually with their competitors <HI>certantes de damno evitando.</HI> The court of &s;e&s;&s;ion accordingly refu&s;ed to &s;u&s;tain the claim of the trade&s;men and furni&s;hers <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dec. 4. 1735, Burns contra creditors of Maclellan.</NOTE>. Hence appears a remarkable difference between property and obligation. Money laid out upon a &s;ubject by the <HI>bona fide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or,</HI> whether for melioration or to pre&s;erve it from damage, makes the proprietor <HI>locupletior,</HI> and a <HI>captator lucri ex aliena jactura.</HI> But though a creditor be benefited by another's lo&s;s, &s;o as by that means to draw a greater proportion of his debt, he is not, however, a gainer upon the whole, but is &s;till <HI>certans de damno evitando.</HI> And when the parties are thus <HI>in pari ca&s;u,</HI> a court of equity cannot inter|po&s;e, but mu&s;t leave them to the common law.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="112">
I add another limitation, which is not peculiar to the maxim un|der con&s;ideration, but ari&s;es from the very con&s;titution of a court of equity. It is not &s;ufficient that there be gain, even in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e: it is nece&s;&s;ary that the gain be clear and certain; for otherwi&s;e a court of equity mu&s;t not undertake to repair the lo&s;s out of that gain. The principle of utility, in order to prevent arbitrary proceed|ings, prohibits a court of equity to take under con&s;ideration a conjec|tural lo&s;s or a conjectural gain, becau&s;e &s;uch lo&s;s or gain can never be brought under a general rule. I give the following illu&s;trations. Two heritors having each of them a &s;almon-fi&s;hing in the &s;ame part of a river, are in u&s;e to exerci&s;e their rights alternately. One is in|terrupted for &s;ome time by a &s;uit at the in&s;tance of a third party: the other by this means has more capture than u&s;ual, though he va|ries not his manner of fi&s;hing. What the one lo&s;es by the interrup|tion is probably gained by the other, at lea&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure. But as what is here transferred from the one to the other cannot be a&s;cer|tained with any degree of certainty, a court of equity mu&s;t not inter|po&s;e. Again, a tenant upon the faith of a long lea&s;e, lays out con&s;i|derable &s;ums upon improving his land, and reaps the benefit a few years. But the landlord, who holds the land by a military tenure, dies &s;uddenly in the flower of his age, leaving an infant heir: the land by this means comes into the &s;uperior's hand, and the lea&s;e is &s;uper&s;eded during the ward. Here a great part of the extraordina|ry meliorations which the le&s;&s;ee intended for his own benefit, are converted to the u&s;e of the &s;uperior. Yet equity cannot interpo&s;e, becau&s;e no general rule can be laid down for a&s;certaining the gain made by the &s;uperior. I have one ca&s;e to quote which confirms this doctrine. In an action at a tercer's in&s;tance for a third of the rents levied by the fiar, the court refu&s;ed to &s;u&s;tain a deduc|tion claimed by the defendant, <HI>viz.</HI> a third of the factor-fee paid by him for levying the rents, though it was urged, that the pur&s;uer could not have levied her third with le&s;s expence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, March 27. 1634, Lady Dun&s;ermline contra her &s;on.</NOTE>. The lo&s;s here was not a&s;certained, and was &s;carce capable of being a&s;certained; for no one could &s;ay what le&s;s the factor would have accepted for levying two thirds of the rent than for levying the whole. Neither was the profit capable to be a&s;certained: the lady her&s;elf might have uplifted her &s;hare, or have got a friend to &s;erve her <HI>gratis.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e with one further limitation, which regards not only the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, but every claim that can be founded on equity. Courts of equity are introduced in every country to inforce natural
<PB N="104" REF="113">
ju&s;tice, and by no means to give aid to any wrong. Whence it follows, that no man can be intitled to the aid of a court of equity, when that aid becomes nece&s;&s;ary by his own fault. For this rea&s;on, when the pro|prietor is made liable for the expence of profitable meliorations, this can only be when the meliorations were made <HI>bona fide</HI> by a per&s;on rea&s;onably intending his own profit, and not &s;u&s;pecting any hazard. It is laid down however in the Roman law, That the nece&s;&s;ary ex|pence laid out in upholding the &s;ubject, may be claimed by the <HI>mala &s;ide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 5. C. De rei vindic.</NOTE>. If &s;uch reparations be made while the proprietor is ig|norant of his right, and the ruin of the edifice be thereby prevented, there po&s;&s;ibly may be a foundation in utility for the claim: but I de|ny there can be any foundation in ju&s;tice. And therefore, if a te|nant, after being ejected by legal execution, &s;hall ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t to plow and &s;ow, he ought to have no claim for his &s;eed nor his labour. The claim in the&s;e circum&s;tances hath no foundation either in ju&s;tice or utility: yet the claim was &s;u&s;tained <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, February 22. 1671, Gordon contra Macculloch.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But there are many per&s;onal connections joined with a much &s;light|er real connection than that above mentioned, which intitle a man to have his lo&s;s made up out of our gain. Of which take the follow|ing examples.</P>
<P>There are three creditors connected, fir&s;t by their relation to the &s;ame debtor who is a bankrupt; and next, by their relation to two land-e&s;tates A and B belonging to the debtor, the fir&s;t creditor being preferably &s;ecured on both e&s;tates, one of the &s;econdary creditors be|ing &s;ecured upon A, the other upon B. The catholic creditor pur|cha&s;es one of the &s;econdary debts under its value, by which he is a gainer; for by his preferable debt he cuts out the other &s;econdary creditor, and by that means draws the whole price of the two &s;ub|jects. The que&s;tion is, Whether equity will &s;uffer him to retain his gain again&s;t the other &s;econdary creditor, who is thus cut out of his &s;ecurity? It cannot indeed be &s;pecified here, as in the ca&s;e of the <HI>bonae &s;idci po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or rei alienae,</HI> that money given out by the one is converted to the u&s;e of the other: but then the lo&s;s and gain are ne|ce&s;&s;arily connected by having a common cau&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> the purcha&s;e made by the catholic creditor. This connection between lo&s;s and gain, joined with the per&s;onal connections above mentioned, make it the duty of the catholic creditor to communicate his profit, in or|der to make up the lo&s;s that the other creditor &s;u&s;tains. And one may with confidence deliver this opinion, when the following cir|cum&s;tance
<PB N="105" REF="114">
is added, that the lo&s;s was occa&s;ioned by the catholic cre|ditor, in making a purcha&s;e that he was &s;en&s;ible would ruin his fel|low-creditor.</P>
<P>The next ca&s;e in order, is of two a&s;&s;ignees to the &s;ame bond, igno|rant of each other. The cedent or a&s;&s;ignor contrives to draw the purcha&s;e-money from both, and walks off in a &s;tate of bankruptcy. The latter a&s;&s;ignment, being fir&s;t intimated, will be preferred. But to what extent? Will it be preferred for the whole &s;um in the bond, or only for the tran&s;acted &s;um? The circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e fa|vour the po&s;tponed a&s;&s;ignee, though they have not the &s;ame weight with tho&s;e in the former: the material difference is, that the a&s;&s;ignee preferred made his purcha&s;e without knowing of his competitor, and con&s;equently without any thought of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing him. The per&s;onal connection however, joined with the nece&s;&s;ary connection between the lo&s;s and gain, appears &s;ufficient to deprive the la&s;t a&s;&s;ignee of his gain, in order to make up the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the fir&s;t. The ca&s;e would be more doubtful, had the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ignment been fir&s;t completed; becau&s;e it may appear hard, that the intervention of a &s;econd pur|cha&s;er &s;hould deprive the fir&s;t of a profitable bargain. I leave this point to be ripened by time and mature deliberation. The progre&s;s of equity is &s;low, though con&s;tant, toward the more delicate articles of natural ju&s;tice. If there appear any difficulty about extending equity to this ca&s;e, the difficulty probably will vani&s;h in cour&s;e of time.</P>
<P>One thing is certain, that in the Engli&s;h court of chancery there would be no he&s;itation to apply equity to this ca&s;e. That court ex|tends its power a great way farther; farther indeed than &s;eems ju&s;t. A &s;tranger, for example, who purcha&s;es a prior incumbrance, can draw no more from the other incumbrancers than the &s;um he really paid <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Vernon 476.</NOTE>: and to ju&s;tify this extraordinary opinion, it is &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"That the taking away one man's gain to make up another's lo&s;s, is making them both equal."</Q> This argument, if it prove any thing, proves too much, being applicable to any two per&s;ons indifferently who have not the &s;malle&s;t connection, &s;uppo&s;ing only the one to have made a profitable, the other a lo&s;ing bargain. There ought to be &s;ome connection to found &s;uch a demand: the per&s;ons ought to be connected by a common concern; and the lo&s;s and gain ought to be connected, &s;o at lea&s;t as that the one be occa&s;ioned by the other. The fir&s;t connection only is found in this ca&s;e: a &s;tranger who pur|cha&s;es a prior incumbrance is indeed, by a common &s;ubject, connect|ed
<PB N="106" REF="115">
with the other incumbrancers: but this purcha&s;e does not harm the other incumbrancers; for when the purcha&s;er claims the debt in its utmo&s;t extent, it is no more than what his author was intitled to do. The rule of chancery, in this view, appears a little whim&s;ical: it deprives me of a lucrative bargain, the fruit of my own indu&s;try, to be&s;tow it, not upon any per&s;on who is hurt by the bargain, but upon tho&s;e who are in no wor&s;e condition than before the bargain was made. Neither am I clear, that this rule can be &s;upported upon a principle of utility: for though it is preventive of hard and unequal bargains; yet as no prudent man will purcha&s;e an incumbrance up|on &s;uch a condition, it is in effect a prohibition of &s;uch purcha&s;es, which would prove a great inconveniency to many who&s;e funds are locked up by the bankruptcy of their debtors.</P>
<P>That an heir acquiring an incumbrance &s;hould be allowed no more but what he really paid, or, which comes to the &s;ame, that he &s;hould be bound to communicate ea&s;es, is a propo&s;ition more agreeable to the principles of equity. This is the law of England <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Salkeld 155.</NOTE>, and it is the law of Scotland with regard to heirs who take the benefit of in|ventory. But the ca&s;e of an heir is very different from that of a &s;tran|ger. He hath in his hand the fund for payment of the creditors, which he ought faithfully to account for; and therefore he is not permitted to &s;tate any article for exhau&s;ting that fund beyond what he hath actually expended: if a creditor accept le&s;s than his propor|tion, the fund for the other creditors is &s;o much the larger.</P>
<P>A cautioner upon making payment obtaining an ea&s;e, mu&s;t com|municate the &s;ame to the principal debtor, upon a plain ground in common law, that being &s;ecure of his relief from the principal debt|or, he can have no claim but to be kept <HI>indemnis.</HI> But &s;uppo&s;ing the principal debtor bankrupt, I di&s;cover no ground other than paction, that can bind one cautioner to communicate ea&s;es to another: and yet it is the prevailing, I may &s;ay the e&s;tabli&s;hed, opinion, That a cautioner who obtains an ea&s;e mu&s;t communicate the benefit to his co-cautioner. I am aware of the rea&s;on commonly a&s;&s;igned, That cautioners for the &s;ame debt are to be con&s;idered as in a &s;ociety, obli|ged to bear the lo&s;s equally. But this, I doubt, is arguing in a circle: they re&s;emble a &s;ociety, becau&s;e the lo&s;s mu&s;t be equal; and the lo&s;s mu&s;t be equal, becau&s;e they re&s;emble a &s;ociety. We mu&s;t therefore go more accurately to work. In the fir&s;t place, let us examine whe|ther an obligation for mutual relief ought to be implied. This im|plication, at be&s;t doubtful, &s;uppo&s;es the cautioners to have &s;ub&s;cri|bed
<PB N="107" REF="116">
in a body. And therefore, to leave no room for an implied ob|ligation, we need but &s;uppo&s;e, that two per&s;ons, ignorant of each other, become cautioners at different times, and in different deeds. It appears, then, that common law affords not an obligation for mu|tual relief. The matter is &s;till more clear with regard to equity: for the connection between two cautioners can never be &s;o intimate, as to oblige the one who is not a gainer to make up the other's lo&s;s; which is the ca&s;e of the cautioner who obtains an ea&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing that ea&s;e to be le&s;s than that proportion of the debt which he &s;tands bound to pay. Upon the whole, my notion is, that if a cautioner, upon ac|count of objections again&s;t the debt, or upon account of any circum|&s;tance that regards the principal debtor, obtain an ea&s;e, he is bound to communicate that ea&s;e to his fellow-cautioner, upon the following rational principle, That both cautioners ought equally to partake of an ea&s;e, the motive to which re&s;pects them equally. This clearly enough appears to be the <HI>ratio decidendi</HI> in the ca&s;e reported by Stair, July 27. 1672, Brodie contra Keith. But if upon prompt payment by one cautioner after the failure of others, or upon any con&s;idera|tion per&s;onal to the cautioner, an ea&s;e be given; equity, I think, ob|liges not the cautioner to communicate the benefit to his fellow-cau|tioners. And this was decreed, Stair, July 8. 1664, Ni&s;bet contra Le&s;&s;ie.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance that, without much connection real or per&s;onal, extends to many ca&s;es the maxim, <HI>Quod nemo debet locuple|tari aliena jactura;</HI> and that is fraud, deceit, or any &s;ort of wrong. If by means of a third per&s;on's fraud one gains and another lo&s;es, a court of equity will interpo&s;e to make up the lo&s;s out of the gain. And this re&s;olves into a general rule, <Q REND="inline">"That no man, however innocent, ought to take advantage of a tortious act by which another is hurt."</Q> Take the following example. A &s;econd di&s;po&s;ition of land, though gratuitous, with the fir&s;t infeftment, is preferred in common law be|fore the fir&s;t di&s;po&s;ition without infeftment, though for a valuable con&s;ideration. But as the gratuitous di&s;ponee is thus benefited by a moral wrong done by his author, he ought not, however innocent, to take advantage of that moral wrong to hurt the fir&s;t di&s;ponee. This circum&s;tance makes the rule applicable, <HI>Quod non debet locuple|tari alicna jactura;</HI> and therefore a court of equity will compel him, either to give up his right to the land, or to repair the lo&s;s the fir&s;t di&s;ponee has &s;uffered by being deprived of his purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>The following ca&s;es re&s;t upon the &s;ame principle. A di&s;po&s;ition by a merchant of his whole e&s;tate to his infant-&s;on, without a re&s;erved
<PB N="108" REF="117">
liferent or power to burden, was deemed fraudulent, in order to cheat his corre&s;pondents, foreign merchants, who had traded with him be|fore the alienation, and continued their dealings with him upon the belief that he was &s;till proprietor; and their claims, though po&s;terior to the di&s;po&s;ition, were admitted to affect the e&s;tate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, July 2. 1673, Street contra Ma&s;on.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Where a tutor acting to the be&s;t of his &s;kill for the good of his pu|pil, happens, in the ordinary cour&s;e of admini&s;tration, to convert a moveable debt into one that is heritable, or an heritable debt into one that is moveable; &s;uch an act, after the pupil's death, will have its full effect with re&s;pect to the pupil's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by preferring his heir or executor, as if the act had been done by a proprietor of full age. But where the tutor acts in this manner unnece&s;&s;arily, with the &s;ole intention to prefer the heir or the executor, this is a tortious act, con|trary to the duty he owes his pupil, which will affect the heir or ex|ecutor, though they had no acce&s;&s;ion to the wrong. In common law the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion will take place according to the tutor's act, whether done with a right or a wrong intention; but this will be corrected in equity, upon the principle, That no per&s;on ought to take advantage of a tortious act that harms another.</P>
<P>A donation <HI>inter virum et uxorem</HI> is revocable; but not a donation to the hu&s;band or wife's children, or to any other relation. A wife makes a donation of her land-e&s;tate to her hu&s;band; who afterward, in order to bar revocation, gives up the di&s;po&s;ition granted to him, and in&s;tead of it takes a di&s;po&s;ition to his elde&s;t &s;on. Will this di&s;|po&s;ition be revocable? Where a wife out of affection to her hu&s;band's elde&s;t &s;on makes a deed in his favour, it is not revocable, be|cau&s;e it is not a <HI>donatio inter virum et uxorem.</HI> But in this ca&s;e it is clear, that the donation was really intended for the hu&s;band, and that the &s;ole purpo&s;e of the di&s;po&s;ition to the &s;on was to bar revoca|tion; which was an unlawful contrivance to elude the law. It would be wrong therefore in the &s;on, however innocent, to take advantage of his father's tortious act, calculated to deprive the woman of her privilege; and therefore the di&s;po&s;ition to him will be revocable in equity, as that to the father was at common law.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ART. II.</HI> Connections that intitle a man who is not a lo&s;er, to partake of our gain.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the &s;ake of per&s;picuity, this article &s;hall be divided into two branches: 1&s;t, Where the gain is the operation of the man who
<PB N="109" REF="118">
claims to partake of it. 2d, Where he has not contributed to the gain.</P>
<P>I introduce the fir&s;t branch with a ca&s;e which will be a key to the &s;everal matters that come under it. Two heirs-portioners, or in ge|neral two proprietors of a land-e&s;tate <HI>pro indivi&s;o,</HI> get for a farm, having a lake in it, a rent of eighty pounds yearly, with an offer of ten pounds additional rent if they will drain the lake. A is willing; but B refu&s;es, judging it to be impracticable, or at lea&s;t too expen|&s;ive. A however proceeds at his own ri&s;k; and for the &s;um of L. 100 drains the lake. He cannot &s;pecify any lo&s;s by this under|taking; becau&s;e the &s;um he laid out is more than compen&s;ated by the five pound additional rent accruing to him: and therefore the maxim, <HI>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena juctura,</HI> is not applicable to his ca&s;e. But B is a profiter, not only by A's advancing the mo|ney, but at his ri&s;k; for if the undertaking had proved abortive, A would have lo&s;t both his labour and money. Is it agreeable to the rules of ju&s;tice, that B &s;hould be permitted to lay hold of an addi|tional rent of L. 5, without defraying any part of the expence laid out upon the acqui&s;ition? He cannot ju&s;tify this to his own con|&s;cience, nor to any human being. The moral &s;en&s;e dictates, that where expence is laid out in improving or repairing a common &s;ub|ject, no one ought to lay hold of the benefit, without refunding a part of the expence in proportion to the benefit received.</P>
<P>This leads to a general rule, That expence laid out upon a com|mon &s;ubject, ought to be a burden upon the benefit procured. And this rule will hold even again&s;t the di&s;&s;ent of any of the parties con|cerned; for they cannot in con&s;cience take the benefit without the burden. A di&s;&s;ent cannot have any effect in equity, but only to free the per&s;on di&s;&s;enting from any ri&s;k.</P>
<P>The following ca&s;es, being of the &s;ame kind with that above &s;ta|red, come clearly under the general rule. One of three joint pro|prietors of a mill, having rai&s;ed a declarator of thirlage, and, not|with&s;tanding a di&s;clamation by the others, having in&s;i&s;ted in the pro|ce&s;s till he obtained a decree; the others who reaped the profit e|qually with him, were made liable for their &s;hare of the expence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, January 6. 1676, Forbes contra Ro&s;s.</NOTE>.

If the expence of the&s;e, in pro|portion to the benefit, be not in &s;ome way refunded, glebes will re&s;t in their original &s;tate for ever. I do not &s;ay, that the mini&s;ter im|mediately &s;ucceeding ought to be liable for the whole of this expence: for as the benefit is &s;uppo&s;ed to be perpetual, the burden ought to be equally &s;o: which &s;ugge&s;ts the following opinion, That the &s;um|total of the expence ought to be converted into a perpetual annuity, to be paid by the mini&s;ters of this pari&s;h; for the only equitable method is, to make each contribute in proportion to the benefit he receives.</P>
<P>The following ca&s;e belongs undoubtedly to the maxim of equity under con&s;ideration; and yet was judged by common law, neglect|ing the equitable remedy. In a &s;hipwreck, part of the cargo being fi&s;hed out of the &s;ea and &s;aved, was delivered to the owners for pay|ment of the &s;alvage. The proprietor of the &s;hip claiming the freight of the goods &s;aved, <HI>pro rata itineris,</HI> the freighters admitted the claim; but in&s;i&s;ted, that as the &s;alvage was beneficial to him on account of his freight, as well as to them on account of their goods, he ought
<PB N="111" REF="120">
to pay a proportion of the &s;alvage. His an&s;wer was &s;u&s;tained to free him from any part, <HI>viz.</HI> That the expence was wholly laid out on recovering the freighter's goods; and therefore that they only ought to be liable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">January 18. 1735, Lutwich contra Gray.</NOTE>. The an&s;wer here &s;u&s;tained re&s;olves into the follow|ing propo&s;ition, That he only is liable who&s;e benefit is intended: which is certainly not good in equity; for at that rate, the <HI>bona fide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or,</HI> who in meliorating the &s;ubject intends his own benefit &s;ole|ly, has no claim again&s;t the proprietor. Here the freighters and the proprietor of the &s;hip were connected by a common intere&s;t: the re|covering the goods from &s;hipwreck was beneficial to both parties; to the freighters, becau&s;e it put them again in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their goods; and to the proprietor of the &s;hip, becau&s;e it gave him a claim for freight. The &s;alvage accordingly was truly <HI>in rem ver&s;um</HI> of both; and for that rea&s;on ought to be paid by both in proportion to the benefit received. This ca&s;e may be con&s;idered in a different light that will &s;carce admit a di&s;pute. Suppo&s;e that the owners of the cargo, in recovering their goods to the extent of L. 1000, have laid out L. 100 upon &s;alvage: they have in effect &s;aved or recovered but L. 900; and beyond that &s;um they cannot be liable for the freight: which in numbers will bring out a greater &s;um than what re&s;ults from the rule above mentioned.</P>
<P>It will not e&s;cape the reader, that equity is further extended in this branch than in the former; and he will al&s;o di&s;cover a &s;olid rea&s;on for the difference. With re&s;pect to matters contained in the former branch, the real connection is only, that what is lo&s;t by the one is gained by the other; as in the ca&s;e of a <HI>bona fide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or rei alienae.</HI> But the real connection of matters in the pre&s;ent branch is &s;o far more intimate, that every acqui&s;ition mu&s;t benefit all equally, and every lo&s;s burden all equally.</P>
<P>It appears, that a benefit accruing to another by my la|bour, occa&s;ionally only not nece&s;&s;arily, will not intitle me to a claim where I am not a lo&s;er. To make the truth of this ob&s;ervation evi|dent, a few examples will be &s;ufficient. A drain made by me in my own ground for my own behoof, happens to di&s;charge a quanti|ty of water that &s;tagnated in a &s;uperior field belonging to a neigh|bour. Ju&s;tice does not intitle me to claim from this neighbour any &s;hare of the expence laid out upon the drain. The drain has an|&s;wered my intention, and overpays the &s;um be&s;towed upon it: there|fore my ca&s;e comes not under the maxim, <HI>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura.</HI> Neither can I have any claim upon the rule, That
<PB N="112" REF="121">
expence laid out upon a common &s;ubject ought to be a burden upon the benefit procured; for here there is no common &s;ubject, but on|ly another per&s;on accidentally or occa&s;ionally benefited by an opera|tion intended &s;olely for my own benefit. And Providence has wi&s;ely ordered that &s;uch a claim &s;hould have no &s;upport from the moral &s;en&s;e; for as there can be no preci&s;e rule for e&s;timating the benefit that each of us receives from the drain, the &s;ubjecting my neighbour to a claim would tend to create endle&s;s di&s;putes between us. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, if my neighbour in making an inclo&s;ure take advantage of a march-&s;ence built by me, he will not be liable to any part of the expence be&s;towed by me upon it; becau&s;e the benefit, as in the former ca&s;e, is occa&s;ional only or con&s;equential.</P>
<P>From the nature of the claim handled in the pre&s;ent branch, it follows, that if the party again&s;t whom the claim is laid, renounce the benefit, he cannot be &s;ubjected to the burden.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the branch now handled, the circum&s;tance that the benefit accruing to another was occa&s;ioned by my means, is the connection that intitles me to a proportion of the &s;um I laid out in procuring that benefit. But with re&s;pect to the &s;econd branch, which we are next to enter upon, it mu&s;t require &s;ome per&s;onal relation extremely intimate to intitle me to par|take of another man's profit when I have not contributed to it. And this will be made evident by the following examples.</P>
<P>When land is held ward, and the &s;uperior is under age, a gift of his ward is effectual again&s;t his va&s;&s;al as well as again&s;t him&s;elf. But where the gift of ward was taken for behoof of the &s;uperior, it was the opinion of the court, that the va&s;&s;al al&s;o had the benefit thereof upon paying his proportion of the compo&s;ition <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dirleton, December 1. 1676, Grier&s;on contra Ragg.</NOTE>. Again&s;t this opinion it was urged, That a va&s;&s;al mu&s;t lay his account with be|ing liable to all the ca&s;ualties ari&s;ing from the nature of his right; and that there was no rea&s;on for limiting the &s;uperior's claim, more than that of any other donatar. But it was an&s;wered, That the rela|tion between &s;uperior and va&s;&s;al is &s;uch, as that the &s;uperior cannot <HI>bona &s;ide</HI> take advantage again&s;t his va&s;&s;al of a ca&s;ualty occa&s;ioned by his own minority. The &s;ame rule was applied to a gift of marriage taken for behoof of the &s;uperior <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Harca&s;e, (Ward and Marriage), Jan. 1686, Drummelzier contra Murray of Stanhope.</NOTE>. And it appearing that the &s;upe|rior had obtained this gift for alledged good &s;ervices, without paying any compo&s;ition, the benefit was communicated to the va&s;&s;al without obliging him to pay any &s;um <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

If a purcha&s;er of land, di&s;covering a defect in the title derived to him from his author, &s;ecure him&s;elf by acquiring the preferable title, the common law will not permit him to found upon this new acqui|red title as a ground of eviction, to make his author, bound in ab&s;o|lute warrandice, liable for the value of the &s;ubject: for the purcha|&s;er is not intitled to the value unle&s;s the land be actually evicted from him; and, as the ca&s;e now &s;tands, the purcha&s;er cannot have any claim upon the warrandice beyond the &s;um he paid for the title. This point is &s;till more clear upon the principle of equity above mentioned. The connection is &s;o intimate between a purcha&s;er, and a vender bound in ab&s;olute warrandice, that every tran&s;action made by either, with relation to the &s;ubject purcha&s;ed, is deemed to be for behoof of both.</P>

One parcel is &s;old with ab&s;olute warrandice; and the purcha&s;er, di&s;covering the title-deed to be imperfect, acquires from a third party a preferable title to the whole parcels. He is no doubt bound to communicate the benefit of this acqui&s;ition to the vender, as far as regards the parcel he purcha&s;ed. But there is no|thing at common law to bar him from evicting the other parcels from the vender. Whether a relief can be afforded in equity, is doubt|ful. The connection between the parties is pretty intimate: the purcha&s;er is bound to communicate to the vender the benefit of his acqui&s;ition with re&s;pect to one parcel, and it is natural to extend the &s;ame remedy to the whole. One ca&s;e of this nature occurred in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. A man having right to &s;everal &s;ubjects contained in an adjudication, &s;old one of them with ab&s;olute warrandice; and the purcha&s;er having acquired a title preferable to his author's adju|dication, claimed the &s;ubjects that were not di&s;poned to him.

It is not certain whether this decree was laid upon the principle above mentioned: for what moved &s;ome of the judges was the danger of permitting a purcha&s;er acquainted with the title-deeds of his author, to take advantage of his knowledge by picking up preferable titles; and that this, as an unfair practice, ought to be prohibited.</P>

management, and where ruin mu&s;t en&s;ue, if no per&s;on actuated with the principle of benevolence be moved to interpo&s;e. Here friend|&s;hip and good-will have a favourable opportunity to exert them&s;elves, and to do much good, perhaps without any extraordinary labour or great expence. But there can be no management without labour and expence more or le&s;s; and when a proprietor is benefited by &s;uch acts of friend&s;hip or benevolence, ju&s;tice and gratitude claim from the proprietor a retribution, to the extent at lea&s;t of the benefit received. Here the maxim <HI>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura,</HI> is applicable in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e. Hence the <HI>actio negotiorum ge&s;torum</HI> in the Ro|man law, which for the rea&s;on given is adopted by all civilized na|tions.</P>
<P>But what if this friendly man, after be&s;towing his money and la|bour with the utmo&s;t precaution, happen to be un&s;ucce&s;sful? What if, after laying out his money profitably upon repairing hou&s;es, or purcha&s;ing cattle for my u&s;e, the benefit be lo&s;t to me by the ca&s;ual de&s;truction of the &s;ubject? would it be ju&s;t that this friend, who had no view but for my intere&s;t, &s;hould run the ri&s;k? As there was no contract between us, a claim will not be &s;u&s;tained at common law for the money expended. But equity pierces deeper into the nature of things, in order to fulfil the rules of ju&s;tice. Service undertaken by a friend upon an urgent occa&s;ion, advances gratitude from a virtue to be a duty; and binds me to <HI>recompen&s;e</HI> my friend as far as he has laid out his own money in order to do me &s;ervice. The moral &s;en&s;e teaches this le&s;&s;on; and no per&s;on, however partial in his own con|cern, but mu&s;t perceive this to be the duty of others. Utility al&s;o joins with ju&s;tice in &s;upport of this claim of recompence. Men ought to be invited to &s;erve a friend in time of need: but in&s;tead of invita|tion, it would be a great di&s;couragement, if the money advanced up|on &s;uch &s;ervice were upon their own ri&s;k, even when laid out with the greate&s;t prudence <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Roman writers found this duty upon their <HI>qua&s;i</HI>-contracts, of which <HI>negotiorum ge&s;tio</HI> is &s;aid to be one. And to under&s;tand this foundation, the nature of <HI>qua&s;i</HI>-contracts mu&s;t be ex|plained. In human affairs certain circum&s;tances and &s;ituations frequently happen that require a covenant, which nothing could prevent but want of opportunity. The pre&s;ent ca&s;e affords a good illu&s;tration. A &s;udden call forces me abroad, without having time to regulate my af|fairs: di&s;order en&s;ues, and a friend undertakes the management. Here nothing prevents a mandate but want of opportunity; and it is pre&s;umed that the mandate would not have been wanting, had I known the good intentions of my friend. Equity accordingly holds the mandate as granted, and gives the &s;ame actions to both that the common law gives in pur|&s;uance of a mandate. Though this &s;erves to explain the Roman <HI>qua&s;i</HI>-contracts, yet it &s;eems a wide &s;tretch in equity to give to a &s;uppo&s;ition the effects of a real contract; e&s;pecially without any evidence that the per&s;on who undertakes the management would have been my choice. But I have endeavoured to make out in the text, that this claim for recompence has a &s;olid foundation in ju&s;tice, and in human nature, without nece&s;&s;ity of recurring to the &s;trained &s;uppo&s;ition of a contract.</NOTE>. This doctrine is laid down by Ulpian in clear terms: <Q REND="inline">"Is autem, qui negotiorum ge&s;torum agit, non &s;olum &s;i effectum habuit negotium quod ge&s;&s;it, actione ita utetur: &s;ed &s;ufficit, &s;i utiliter ge&s;&s;it, et&s;i effectum non habuit negotium.

<P>From what is &s;aid above it is evident, that the man who under|takes my affairs, not to &s;erve me, but to &s;erve him&s;elf, is not intitled to the <HI>actio negotiorum ge&s;torum.</HI> Nor even, &s;uppo&s;ing me to be bene|fited by his management, is he intitled to have his lo&s;s repaired out of my gain: for wrong can never found any claim in equity. Yet Julianus, the mo&s;t acute of the Roman writers, an&s;wers the que&s;tion in the affirmative. Treating of one who <HI>mala &s;ide</HI> meddles in my af|fairs, he gives the following opinion: <Q REND="inline">"Ip&s;e tamen, &s;i circa res meas aliquid impenderit, non in id quod ei abe&s;t, quia improbe ad nego|tia mea acce&s;&s;it, &s;ed in quod ego locupletior factus &s;um, habet con|tra me actionem <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 6. &sect; 3.

De negot. ge&s;t.</HI> that this author was of a different opinion, where the ma|nagement of a man's affairs was continued again&s;t his will; for there no action was given. This, in my apprehen&s;ion, is e&s;tabli&s;hing a di&s;|tinction without a difference: for no man can hope for my con&s;ent to continue the management of my affairs, when he begun that ma|nagement, not to &s;erve me, but with a view to his own intere&s;t. A prohibition involved in the nature of the thing, is equivalent to an ex|pre&s;s prohibition.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter of a &s;hip, or any other, who ran&s;oms the cargo from a privateer, is, according to the doctrine above laid down, intitled to claim from the owners of the cargo the &s;um laid out upon their ac|count: they profit by the tran&s;action, and they ought to indemnify him. But what if the cargo be afterward lo&s;t in a &s;torm at &s;ea, or by robbery at land? The owners are not now profiters by the ran|&s;om, and therefore they cannot be made liable upon the maxim, <HI>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura.</HI> They are however liable upon the principle here explained. The moment the tran&s;action was fini&s;hed they became debtors to the ran&s;omer for the &s;um he laid out pro|fitably upon their account. He did not undertake the ri&s;k of the
<PB N="116" REF="125">
cargo ran&s;omed; and therefore the ca&s;ual lo&s;s of the cargo cannot have the effect to deprive him of his claim.</P>
<P>The <HI>lex Rhodia de jactu,</HI> a celebrated maritime regulation, has pre|vailed among all civilized nations ancient and modern. When in a &s;torm weighty goods of little value are thrown overboard to di&s;burden the &s;hip, the owners of the remaining cargo mu&s;t contribute to make up the lo&s;s. This ca&s;e, as to the obligation of retribution, is of the &s;ame nature with that now mentioned, and depends on the &s;ame principle. The throwing overboard weighty goods of little value, is extremely beneficial to the owners of the more precious goods, which by that means are pre&s;erved; and, according to the foregoing doc|trine, the&s;e owners ought to contribute for making up the lo&s;s of the goods thrown into the &s;ea, preci&s;ely as if there had been a formal co|venant to that effect. But what if the whole cargo be afterward lo&s;t, by which eventually there is no benefit? If lo&s;t at &s;ea in the &s;ame voyage, the owner of the goods thrown overboard has certainly no claim, becau&s;e at any rate he would have lo&s;t his goods along with the re&s;t of the cargo. But as &s;oon as the cargo is laid upon land, the obligation for retribution is purified; the value of the goods aban|doned to the &s;ea, is or ought to be in the pocket of the owner; and the delay of payment will not afford a defence again&s;t him, whatever become of the cargo after it is landed.</P>
<P>It is a que&s;tion of greater intricacy, Whether the goods &s;aved from the &s;ea ought to contribute according to their weight or according to their value. The latter rule is e&s;pou&s;ed in the Roman law: <Q REND="inline">"Cum in eadem nave varia mercium genera complures mercatores coegi&s;&s;ent, praetereaque multi vectores, &s;ervi liberique in ea navigarent, tem|pe&s;tate gravi orta, nece&s;&s;ario jactura facta erat. Quae&s;ita deinde &s;unt haec: An omnes jacturam prae&s;tare oporteat, et &s;i qui tales merces impo&s;ui&s;&s;ent, quibus navis non oneraretur, velut gemmas, margaritas? et quae portio prae&s;tanda e&s;t?

De lege Rhodia de jactu.</NOTE>."</Q> This rule is adopted by all the commercial nations in Europe, without a &s;ingle exception, as far as I can learn. And in pur&s;uance of the rule, a doctrine begins to reli&s;h with judges, That the owner of the &s;hip ought to contribute, becau&s;e' by throwing over|board
<PB N="117" REF="126">
the goods in que&s;tion, which prevented a &s;hipwreck, his claim for freight is pre&s;erved to him. Thus, if, in &s;tre&s;s of weather, or in danger and ju&s;t fear of an enemy, goods be thrown overboard, in order to &s;ave the &s;hip and the re&s;t of the cargo, that which is &s;aved &s;hall contribute to repair that which is lo&s;t, and the owners of the &s;hip &s;hall contribute in proportion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shower's ca&s;es in parliament 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e authorities notwith&s;tanding, to which, I am &s;en&s;ible, great regard is ju&s;tly due, it is not in my power to bani&s;h an impre&s;&s;ion I have, That the rule of contribution ought to be weight, not value; and whether, after all, the impre&s;&s;ion ought to be bani&s;hed, mu&s;t be decided by rea&s;on, not authority. In every ca&s;e where a man gives away his money or his goods for behoof of a plurality connected by a common intere&s;t, two things are evident: fir&s;t, That his equitable claim for a recompence cannot ex|ceed the lo&s;s he has &s;u&s;tained; and next, That each individual is liable to make up the lo&s;s of that part which was given away on his account. When a ran&s;om is paid to a privateer for the &s;hip and car|go, a &s;hare of the money is under&s;tood to be advanced for each pro|prietor, in proportion to the value of his goods; and that &s;hare he mu&s;t contribute, being laid out upon his account, or for his &s;ervice. That the &s;ame rule is applicable where a &s;hip is &s;aved by abandoning part of its cargo, is far from being clear. Let us examine the matter attentively, &s;tep by &s;tep. The cargo in a violent &s;torm is found too weighty for the &s;hip, which mu&s;t be di&s;burdened of part, let us &s;up|po&s;e the one half. In what manner is this to be done? The an&s;wer would be ea&s;y, were there lei&s;ure and opportunity for a regular ope|ration: each per&s;on who has the weight of a pound aboard, ought to throw the half into the &s;ea; for in &s;trict ju&s;tice one per&s;on is not bound to abandon a greater proportion than another. This method, however, is &s;eldom or never practicable; becau&s;e in a hurry the goods at hand mu&s;t be heaved over: and were it practicable, it would not be for the common intere&s;t, to abandon goods of little weight and great value, along with goods of great weight and little value. Hence it comes to be the common intere&s;t, and, without a&s;king que&s;tions, the common practice, to abandon goods the value of which bears no proportion to their weight. This, as being done for the common intere&s;t, intitles the proprietor of the&s;e goods to a recom|pence from tho&s;e for who&s;e &s;ervice the goods were abandoned. Now the &s;ervice done to each proprietor is, in&s;tead of his valuable goods, to
<PB N="118" REF="127">
have others thrown overboard of a meaner quality; and for &s;uch &s;er|vice all the recompence that can be ju&s;tly claimed is the value of the goods thrown overboard. Let us &s;uppo&s;e with re&s;pect to any owner in particular, that regularly he was bound to throw overboard twen|ty ounces of his goods: all that he is bound to contribute, is the value of twenty ounces of the goods that in place of his own were actually thrown overboard. In a word, this &s;hort-hand way of throwing into the &s;ea the lea&s;t valuable goods, appears to me in the &s;ame light, as if the &s;everal owners of the more valuable part of the cargo, had each of them purcha&s;ed a quantity of the mean goods to be thrown into the &s;ea in&s;tead of their own.</P>
<P>I cannot help at the &s;ame time ob&s;erving, that the doctrine of the Roman law appears very uncouth in &s;ome of its con&s;equences. Jewels, and I may add bank-bills, are made to contribute to make up the lo&s;s, though they contribute not in any degree to the di&s;tre&s;s; nor is a &s;ingle ounce thrown overboard upon their account: nay, the &s;hip it|&s;elf is made to contribute, though the <HI>jactura</HI> is made nece&s;&s;ary, not by the weight of the &s;hip, but by that of the cargo. On the other hand, pa&s;&s;engers are exempted altogether from contributing, for a very whim&s;ical rea&s;on, That the value of a free man cannot be e&s;tima|ted in money: and yet pa&s;&s;engers frequently make a great part of the load. If they contribute to the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;burdening the &s;hip, for what good rea&s;on ought they to be exempted from contributing to make up the lo&s;s of the goods which were thrown into the &s;ea upon their account?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Powers of a court of equity to remedy what is imper&s;ect in common law, with re&s;pect to deeds and covenants.</HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;een above, that, ab&s;tracting from a po&s;itive engagement, the virtue of benevolence is not a duty, except to relieve others from harm. But a man &s;ingly is the mo&s;t helple&s;s of all animals; and unle&s;s he could rely upon &s;upport from others, he would in vain attempt any operation that requires more than two hands. To per|fect &s;ociety by &s;ecuring aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in time of need, promi&s;es and covenants are provided by nature; and to the&s;e accordingly may ju&s;tly be attributed, the progre&s;s at lea&s;t, if not the commencement of every art and manufacture.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="128">
Every promi&s;e and covenant implies nece&s;&s;arily two per&s;ons: one who is bound, termed the <HI>obligor;</HI> and one to whom the obligation is directed, termed the <HI>obligee.</HI></P>
<P>That particular act of the will which binds us whether in promi&s;ing or in contracting, is termed <HI>con&s;ent.</HI> And it is al&s;o that very act which makes a deed effectual; as will thus appear. A deed is of two kinds: one where the granter binds him&s;elf, as in a di&s;po&s;ition, or in a char|ter; which being in effect a promi&s;e, is obviou&s;ly binding upon him by his con&s;ent: the other kind is where the granter declares his will without being bound, as where by a deed he impo&s;es burdens upon his heir: it is the heir's con&s;ent which binds him in that ca&s;e, a con|&s;ent implied from his taking up the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Few per&s;ons pa&s;s much of their time without having purpo&s;es to fulfil and plans to execute, for the accompli&s;hing of which means are employ'd. Among the&s;e means deeds and covenants make a capital figure: no man binds him&s;elf or others for the &s;ake merely of bind|ing, but in order to bring about a de&s;ired event. And therefore eve|ry deed and covenant may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered to be a mean employ'd to bring about &s;ome end or event.</P>
<P>Sometimes the de&s;ired event is mentioned in the deed or contract, and expre&s;ly agreed on or appointed to be performed; in which ca&s;e performance concludes the tran&s;action, becau&s;e it brings to a final i&s;&s;ue all that was intended by the parties concerned. A bond for bor|rowed money is a proper example: what is &s;tipulated in the bond to be performed is repayment of the money, beyond which the parties have no view; and that end is fully accompli&s;hed when the money is paid. A legacy bequeathed in a te&s;tament is another example of the &s;ame kind: payment of the legacy is the only end in view; and that end is accompli&s;hed when the legatee receives the money. But in many deeds and contracts there is a further end in view than merely the performance of what is agreed or appointed. Thus when I buy a hor&s;e with a view to propagation, the contract is performed upon delivery of the hor&s;e to me. But this performance is not &s;ufficient to fulfil my purpo&s;e: I had a further end in view, which was to breed hor&s;es; and unle&s;s the hor&s;e be fit for that end, my purpo&s;e in contracting is fru&s;trated. I purcha&s;e a hog&s;head of flax-&s;eed for rai|&s;ing a crop of flax. It is not enough that the &s;eed be delivered to me: if it be rotten, the end I had in view is di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>This &s;ugge&s;ts a divi&s;ion of deeds and contracts into two kinds. A deed of the fir&s;t kind is where the performance of what is appointed fulfils the intention of the granter: and of the &s;econd kind, where
<PB N="120" REF="129">
that performance is intended as a mean only to a further end, which in that re&s;pect may be termed <HI>ultimate.</HI> In like manner, a contract of the fir&s;t kind is where the performance &s;tipulated is ultimate, by fulfilling what was intended by the parties: of the &s;econd kind, where that performance is intended as a mean only to an ultimate end. In this la&s;t kind, the contract is a mean to bring about the immediate end of performing what was &s;tipulated; and this immediate end is a mean to bring about the ultimate end.</P>
<P>In contracts where the peformance of what is &s;tipulated is a mean only to an ultimate end, there is place for judging how far the means are proportioned to the end: they may be in&s;ufficient to bring about the end: they may be more than &s;ufficient: and they may have no tendency to bring about the end. In ca&s;es of this nature there is place for the interpo&s;ition of equity, to vary the&s;e means in &s;ome ca&s;es, &s;o as to proportion them more accurately to the ultimate end; and in other ca&s;es to &s;et a&s;ide the contract altogether, as in&s;ufficient to bring about the ultimate end. Hence it is that &s;uch contracts are termed <HI>Contracts bonae fidei;</HI> that is, contracts in which equity may interpo&s;e to correct inequalities, and to adju&s;t all matters according to the ho|ne&s;t intention of the parties. With re&s;pect to contracts where the performance &s;tipulated is the ultimate end, there is evidently no place for the interpo&s;ition of equity; for what defence can a man have ei|ther in law or in equity again&s;t performing his engagement, when it fulfils all he had in view in contracting? Hence it is, that contracts of this kind are termed <HI>Contracts &s;tricti juris.</HI></P>
<P>To the noted di&s;tinction between contracts <HI>bonae fidei</HI> and <HI>&s;tricti juris,</HI> great attention is given in the Roman law. We are told, that equity may interpo&s;e in the former, and that the latter are left to common law. But as to what contracts are <HI>bonae fidei,</HI> and what <HI>&s;tricti juris,</HI> we are left in the dark by Roman writers. Some of their commentators indeed give us li&s;ts or catalogues; but they pretend not to lay down any rule by which the one kind may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other. I have endeavoured to &s;upply that defect: it belongs to others to judge whether my endeavours have been &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>To prevent mi&s;takes in the application of the foregoing doctrine, it is nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved, that the end here under&s;tood is not that which may be &s;ecretly in view of the one or the other party, but that which is &s;poke out, or under&s;tood by the parties concerned; for a thought retained within the mind, cannot have the effect to quali|fy an obligation more than to create it. The overlooking this di&s;tinc|tion
<PB N="121" REF="130">
has led Puffendorff into a gro&s;s error: who puts the ca&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">lib. 3. cap. 6. &sect; 7.</NOTE>, That a man, upon a fal&s;e report of all his hor&s;es being de&s;troy'd, makes a contract for a new cargo; and his opinion is, That in equity the purcha&s;er is not bound. This opinion favours too much of a college, and of a man unacquainted with the world and its commerce. Were mi&s;takes of this kind indulged with a remedy, there would be no end of law-&s;uits. At this rate, if I purcha&s;e a quantity of body or table linen, ignorant at the time of a legacy left me of &s;uch goods, I ought to be relieved in equity again&s;t the purcha&s;e, having now no occa&s;ion for the&s;e goods. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on, if I purcha&s;e a hor&s;e by commi&s;&s;ion for a friend, who happens to be dead at the time of the purcha&s;e; there mu&s;t be a relief in equity, though I made the pur|cha&s;e in my own name. But there is no foundation for this opinion in equity more than at common law. If a &s;ubject an&s;wer the pur|po&s;e for which it is purcha&s;ed, the vender has no farther concern: he is intitled upon delivery to demand the price, without regarding any private or extrin&s;ic motive that might have led his party to make the purcha&s;e. In general, a man who expo&s;es his goods to &s;ale mu&s;t an&s;wer for their &s;ufficiency; becau&s;e there is no obligation in equity to pay a price for goods that an&s;wer not the purpo&s;e for which they are &s;old by the one, and bought by the other: but if a purcha&s;er be led into an error or mi&s;take that regards not the &s;ubject nor the vender, the con&s;equences mu&s;t re&s;t upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add upon this general head, that the end propo&s;ed to be brought about by a deed or covenant ought to be lawful; for to make effectual an unlawful act is incon&s;i&s;tent with the very nature of a court of law. Thus a bond granted by a woman, binding her to pay a &s;um if &s;he &s;hould marry, is unlawful, as tending to bar popula|tion; and therefore will be rejected even by a court of common law. And the &s;ame fate will attend every obligation granted <HI>ob turpem cau|&s;am;</HI> a bond, for example, granted to a woman as a bribe to commit adultery or fornication. So far there is no occa&s;ion for a court of equity.</P>
<P>This chapter, con&s;i&s;ting of a multitude of parts, requires many di|vi&s;ions; and in the divi&s;ions that follow per&s;picuity is &s;tudied, which ought to be the chief object in every arrangement.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I. Where the words expre&s;&s;ing will or con&s;ent are imperfect.</HEAD>
<P>IN applying the rules of equity to deeds and covenants, what fir&s;t pa&s;&s;es under examination is, Whether the will or con&s;ent be ful|ly or fairly taken down in the writing. A man, expre&s;&s;ing even his own thoughts, is not always happy in his terms: errors may creep in, which are multiplied when improper words are u&s;ed in writing. Thus clau&s;es in writings are &s;ometimes ambiguous or ob&s;cure, &s;ome|times too limited, and &s;ometimes too exten&s;ive. As common law af|fords no remedy, the imperfection is &s;upplied by a court of equity. It admits words and writing to be indeed the proper evidence of will; but it does not exclude other evidence. Sen&s;ible that words and wri|ting are &s;ometimes erroneous, it endeavours if po&s;&s;ible to reach will, which is the only &s;ub&s;tantial part; and if, from the end and purpo&s;e of the engagement, from collateral circum&s;tances, or other &s;atisfying evi|dence, the will can be a&s;certained, it is ju&s;tly made the rule of judge|ment. The &s;ole purpo&s;e of words is to bear te&s;timony of will; and if their te&s;timony be fal&s;e, they are ju&s;tly di&s;regarded. This branch of equitable juri&s;diction, which obviou&s;ly reaches &s;ingle deeds as well as covenants, is founded on the principle of ju&s;tice; becau&s;e every man feels him&s;elf bound by the con&s;ent he really interpo&s;ed, without relation to words or writing, which &s;tand for evidence only.</P>
<P>This &s;ection may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into three articles. 1&s;t, Where the words leave us uncertain about will. 2d, Where they fall &s;hort of will. And, 3d, Where they go beyond it.</P>
<DIV5 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>ART. I.</HI> Where the words leave us uncertain about will.</HEAD>
<P>THIS imperfection may be occa&s;ioned by the fault of the writer in u&s;ing improper terms; or by the fault of the parties, whether by willing indi&s;tinctly, or by expre&s;&s;ing their will ob&s;curely. But I pur|po&s;ely have neglected this di&s;tinction, becau&s;e in mo&s;t of the ca&s;es that occur, it is extremely doubtful upon whom the imperfection is to be charged. Nor will this breed the lea&s;t confu&s;ion or intricacy; for whatever occa&s;ions the <HI>quae&s;tio voluntatis,</HI> there is but one method for a&s;certaining it; and that is, from the nature of the deed or cove|nant,
<PB N="123" REF="132">
and from concomitant circum&s;tances, to form the mo&s;t ratio|nal conjecture what truly is the will.</P>
<P>A wife gives a &s;ecurity upon her e&s;tate to her hu&s;band's creditors; but with what intention is not &s;pecified. If a donation was intend|ed, &s;he has no claim again&s;t her hu&s;band: but <HI>in dubio,</HI> a cautionary engagement mu&s;t be pre&s;umed, which will afford her a claim for re|lief <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, January 11. 1679, Bowie contra Corbet. Fountainhall, July 16. 1696, Lei&s;h|man contra Nicols. November 29. 1728, Trail of Sabae contra Moodie.</NOTE>. Though in general the intention mu&s;t fir&s;t be a&s;certained be|fore it can be pronounced what is to follow from it; yet it is pre&s;u|med, that a court of common law would hardly be brought to &s;u&s;tain a claim of this nature, where there is no clau&s;e in the deed upon which it can be founded.</P>
<P>Where a man provides a &s;um to his creditor, without declaring it to be in &s;atisfaction, this &s;um will be &s;u&s;tained as a &s;eparate claim at common law. But as the granter probably intended that &s;um to be in &s;atisfaction, according to the principle <HI>Quod debitor non prae&s;umitur donare,</HI> a court of equity, &s;upplying the defect of words, decrees the &s;um to be in &s;atisfaction. Thus, a man being bound for L. 10 year|ly to his daughter, gave her at her marriage a portion of L. 200. Decreed, That the annuity &s;hould be included in the portion <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tothill's reports, 78.</NOTE>. But where a man leaves a legacy to his creditor, this cannot be con|&s;tructed as &s;atisfaction; for in that ca&s;e it would not be a legacy or donation.</P>
<P>Anthony Murray, <HI>anno</HI> 1738, made a &s;ettlement of his e&s;tate upon John and Thomas Bel&s;che&s;es, taking them bound, among other lega|cies, to pay L. 300 Sterling to their &s;i&s;ter Emilia at her marriage. Anthony altered this &s;ettlement <HI>anno</HI> 1740, in favour of his heir at law; obliging him, however, to pay the legacies contained in the former &s;ettlement. In the year 1744, Anthony executed a bond to Emilia upon the narrative of love and favour, binding him&s;elf to pay to her in liferent, and to her children <HI>nati et na&s;cituri</HI> in fee, at the fir&s;t term after his decea&s;e, the &s;um of L. 1200 Sterling. The doubt was, whether both &s;ums were due to Emilia, or only the latter. It was admitted, that both &s;ums would be due at common law, which looks no farther than the words: but that this was not the intention of the granter, was urged from the following circum&s;tance, That in the bond for the L. 1200 there is no mention made of the former le|gacy, nor of any legacy, which clearly &s;hews that Anthony had for|got
<PB N="124" REF="133">
the fir&s;t legacy; and con&s;equently that he intended no more for Emilia but L. 1200 in whole. Which was accordingly decreed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">December 22. 1752, Emilia Bel&s;ches and her hu&s;band contra Sir Patrick Murray.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ART. II.</HI> Where the words fall &s;hort of will.</HEAD>
<P>IN England where e&s;tates are &s;ettled by will, it is the practice to &s;up|ply any defect in the words, in order to &s;upport the will of the devi|&s;or. But then it is a rule, That the will mu&s;t be clearly a&s;certained; for otherwi&s;e the court may be in hazard of forfeiting the heir at law, contrary to the will of his ance&s;tor. Thus where a man devi&s;es land to his heir after the death of his wife, this is a good devi&s;e to the wife for life by nece&s;&s;ary implication: for by the words of the will, the heir is not to have it during her life: and if &s;he have it not, none el&s;e can; for the executors cannot intermeddle <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">New Abridg. of the law, vol. 2. p. 66.</NOTE>. But if a man devi&s;e his land to a &s;tranger after the death of his wife, this does not nece&s;&s;arily in|fer that the wife &s;hould have the e&s;tate for life: it is but declaring at what time the &s;tranger's e&s;tate &s;hall commence; and in the mean time the heir &s;hall have the<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> land.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>N.

A man having two nephews who were his heirs at law, made a &s;ettlement in their favour, dividing his parti|cular farms between them, intending probably an equal divi&s;ion. But in the enumeration of the particular lands, a farm was left out by the omi&s;&s;ion of the clerk, which, as the &s;crivener &s;wore, was in|tended for the plaintiff. The court con&s;idering that the &s;ettlement was voluntary or gratuitous, refu&s;ed to amend the mi&s;take, leaving the farm to de&s;cend equally between the nephews <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">1. Vernon 37.</NOTE>. For here it was not clear that the maker of the deed intended an equal divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;es above mentioned, writing indeed is nece&s;&s;ary as evi|dence, but not as an e&s;&s;ential &s;olemnity: it is of no con&s;equence what words be u&s;ed in the &s;ettlement of a land-e&s;tate, or in the no|mination of an executor, provided the will of the maker be &s;ufficient|ly a&s;certained. But in &s;everal tran&s;actions, writing not only &s;tands
<PB N="125" REF="134">
for evidence, but is be&s;ide an indi&s;pen&s;able &s;olemnity. Land cannot be convey'd without a procuratory or a precept, which mu&s;t be in a &s;et form of words. A man may lend his money upon a verbal pac|tion, but he cannot proceed directly to execution, unle&s;s he have a formal bond containing a clau&s;e of regi&s;tration authori&s;ing execution. Neither can &s;uch a bond be convey'd to a purcha&s;er, otherwi&s;e than by a formal a&s;&s;ignment in writing. Here a new &s;peculation ari&s;es, What power a court of equity hath over a writing of this kind. In this writing not le&s;s than in others, the words may happen erroneou&s;ly to be more exten&s;ive than the will of the granter; or they may happen to be more limited. Mu&s;t the words in all ca&s;es be the &s;overeign rule? By no means. Though in certain tran&s;actions writ is an e&s;&s;ential &s;o|lemnity, it follows not that the words &s;olely mu&s;t be regarded, with|out relation to will; for to bind a man by words where he hath not interpo&s;ed his con&s;ent, is contradictory to the mo&s;t obvious prin|ciples of ju&s;tice. Hence it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that a deed of this kind may, by a court of equity, be limited to a narrower effect than the words naturally import; and that this ought to be done, when from the context, from the intendment of the deed, or from other convincing circum&s;tances, it can be certainly gathered, that the words by mi&s;take go beyond the will. But though in ordinary ca&s;es, &s;uch as tho&s;e above mentioned, the defect of words may be &s;upplied, and force given to will, &s;uppo&s;ing it clearly a&s;certained, yet this cannot be done in a deed to which writ is e&s;&s;ential. The rea&s;on is, that to make writ an e&s;&s;ential &s;olemnity, is in other words to declare, That action mu&s;t not be &s;u&s;tained except as far as authori&s;ed by writ. However clear therefore will may be, a court of equity hath not au|thority to &s;u&s;tain action upon it, independent of the words where the&s;e are made e&s;&s;ential; for this, in effect, would be to overturn the law, which is beyond the power of equity. A ca&s;e that really happened is a notable illu&s;tration of this doctrine. A bond of corroboration granted by the debtor with a cautioner was of the following tenor. <Q REND="inline">"And &s;eeing the fore&s;aid principal &s;um of 1000 merks, and intere&s;t &s;ince Martinmas 1742, are re&s;ting unpaid; and that A the credi|tor is willing to &s;uper&s;ede payment till the term after mentioned upon B the debtor's granting the pre&s;ent corroborative &s;ecurity with C his cautioner; therefore B and C bind and oblige them, conjunctly and &s;everally, &amp;c. to content and pay to A in liferent, and to her children in fee, equally among them, and failing any of them by decea&s;e, to the &s;urvivors, their heirs or a&s;&s;ignees, in fee, and that at Whit&s;unday 1744, with 200 merks of penalty, toge|ther
<PB N="126" REF="135">
with the due and ordinary annualrent of the &s;aid principal &s;um from the &s;aid term of Martinmas 1742,"</Q> &amp;c. Here the obli|gatory clau&s;e is imperfect, as it omits to mention the principal &s;um corroborated, <HI>viz.</HI> the 1000 merks, but only the intere&s;t, a pure over|&s;ight of the writer. In a &s;uit upon this bond of corroboration a|gain&s;t the heir of the cautioner, it was objected, That upon this bond no action could lie for payment of the principal &s;um. It was obvious to the court, that the bond in que&s;tion, though defective in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part, afforded however clear evidence of C's con&s;ent to be bound as cautioner. But then it occurred, that a cautionary engage|ment is one of tho&s;e deeds that require writing, not only in point of evidence, but al&s;o in point of &s;olemnity. A formal bond of corro|boration fulfils the law in both points. But a defective bond, like the pre&s;ent, whatever evidence it may afford, is as nothing in point of &s;olemnity: it is &s;till le&s;s formal than if it wanted any of the requi|&s;ites of the act 1681. Action accordingly was denied; for action cannot be &s;u&s;tained upon con&s;ent alone where a formal deed is e&s;&s;en|tial <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">June 2. 1749, Colt contra Angus.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The following ca&s;e concerning a regi&s;trable bond, or, as termed in England, a bond in judgment, is another in&s;tance of refu&s;ing to &s;upply a defect in words. A bond for a &s;um of money bore the fol|lowing clau&s;e, <HI>with intere&s;t and penalty,</HI> without &s;pecifying any &s;um in name of penalty. The creditor moved the court to &s;upply the o|mi&s;&s;ion, by naming the fifth part of the principal &s;um, being the con&s;tant rule as to con&s;en&s;ual penalties. There could be no doubt of the granter's intention; and yet the court ju&s;tly thought that they had not power to &s;upply the defect <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, January 6. 1705, Le&s;lie contra Ogilvie.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But though a defect in a writ that is e&s;&s;ential in point of &s;olemnity, cannot be &s;upplied &s;o as to give it the full effect that law gives to &s;uch a deed, it may notwith&s;tanding be regarded by a court of equity in point of evidence. A bond of borrowed money, for example, null by the act 1681, becau&s;e the writer's name is neglected, may, in con|junction with other evidence, be produced in an action for payment, in order to prove delivery of the money as a loan, and con&s;equently to found a decree for repayment.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ART. III.</HI> Where the words go beyond will.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a ruel in daily practice, that however expre&s;s the words may be, a court of equity gives no force to a deed beyond the will of the granter. This rule is finely illu&s;trated by the following ca&s;e. John Campbell Provo&s;t of Edinburgh, did, in July 1734, make a &s;ettlement of the whole effects that &s;hould belong to him at the time of his death, to William his elde&s;t &s;on, with the burden of provi&s;ions to his other children, Matthew, Daniel, and Margaret. Daniel being at &s;ea in a voyage from the Ea&s;t Indies, made his will May 1739, in which he <Q REND="inline">"gives and bequeaths all his goods, money, and effects, to John Campbell his father; and in ca&s;e of John's de|cea&s;e, to his beloved &s;i&s;ter Margaret."</Q> The te&s;tator died at &s;ea in the &s;ame month of May; and in June following John the father al&s;o died, without hearing of Daniel's death, or of the will made by him. William brought an action again&s;t his &s;i&s;ter Margaret and her hu&s;|band, concluding, That Daniel's effects being ve&s;ted in the father, were convey'd to him the pur&s;uer by the father's &s;ettlement; and that the &s;ub&s;titution in favour of Margaret contained in Daniel's will was thereby altered. It was an&s;wered, That nothing more was nor could be intended by the Provo&s;t, than to &s;et a&s;ide his heirs <HI>ab inte&s;tato,</HI> by

<P>If equity will not &s;u&s;tain a deed where the words go inadvertently beyond the intention of the granter, much le&s;s will it &s;u&s;tain a deed where the words go cro&s;s to intention. Charles Farquhar&s;on writer, being in a &s;ickly condition, and apprehen&s;ive of death, executed, in the year 1721, a &s;ettlement of all the effects real and per&s;onal that he &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of at his death, in favour of his elde&s;t brother Pa|trick Farquhar&s;on of Inverey, and his heirs and a&s;&s;ignees; re&s;erving a power to alter, and di&s;pen&s;ing with the delivery. Charles was at that time a bachelor, and died &s;o. He recovered however his health, and not only &s;urvived his brother Patrick, but al&s;o his brother's two &s;ons, who &s;ucce&s;&s;ively enjoyed the e&s;tate of Inverey. Patrick left daughters; but as the inve&s;titures of the e&s;tate were taken to heirs|male, Charles &s;ucceeded, died in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate, and tran&s;|mitted the &s;ame to the next heir-male. Again&s;t this heir-male a pro|ce&s;s was brought by the daughters of Patrick, founded upon the

above-mentioned &s;ettlement 1721; &s;ub&s;uming, That Charles the ma|ker died infeft in the &s;aid e&s;tate of Inverey; and therefore that this e&s;tate, by force of the &s;aid &s;ettlement, and by the expre&s;s tenor of it, mu&s;t go to the pur&s;uers, as being the heirs of Patrick Farquhar&s;on. It was an&s;wered by the heir-male, That Charles's evident purpo&s;e and intention, in making this deed, was to augment the family-e&s;tate, by &s;ettling his own acqui&s;itions upon Patrick, the head of the family; that this purpo&s;e was fulfilled by the coalition of both e&s;tates in the defendant, the pre&s;ent head of the family; that the pur&s;uers demand of &s;eparating the two e&s;tates, and of taking from the repre&s;entative of the family the family-e&s;tate it&s;elf, was contradictory to the &s;aid purpo&s;e: and therefore, &s;uppo&s;ing the action to be founded on the words of the deed, a court of equity will not &s;u&s;tain an action that tends to give words an effect not only without intention, but even in contradiction to it. <Q REND="inline">"The court judged, That the pur&s;uers had no action upon the deed 1721 to oblige the defendant to denude of the e&s;tate of Inverey <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Feb. 10. 1756, Heirs of line of Patrick Farquhar&s;on contra heir-male.</NOTE>."</Q></P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Operation of deeds and covenants beyond what is authori&s;ed by declared will.</HEAD>
<P>TO under&s;tand a deed or covenant to be no further effectual than as far as will is declared or expre&s;&s;ed, is a lame and imperfect notion of the&s;e legal acts. Many deeds and many covenants have ef|fects that are not expre&s;sly provided for; which will thus appear. Every rational man who wills expre&s;sly to be&s;tow a right, wills at the &s;ame time, though not expre&s;sly, to be&s;tow every acce&s;&s;ory or &s;ub|ordinate right that tends to make effectual the principal right; for he that wills the end, mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to will the means proper to ac|compli&s;h the end. But whatever a rational man wills, every man is pre&s;umed to will. And hence thefoundation of what in law-language is termed <HI>implied will;</HI> that is, will pre&s;umed without being declared. And it is happy for man to be &s;o con&s;tituted with re&s;pect to the fa|culty that binds him; for if in con&s;cience he were only bound to the articles declared or expre&s;&s;ed, deeds and covenants would often fall &s;hort of their purpo&s;ed end; and, &s;till wor&s;e, would often be the &s;ource of inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Before entering into the particulars that belong to this &s;ection, it mu&s;t be premi&s;ed in general, that every que&s;tion concerning implied will is appropriated to a court of equity; becau&s;e a court of common law regards not any act of will but what is expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Upon the principle mentioned, every lea&s;e of land, long or &s;hort, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily imply a power to remove tenants, where the granter of the lea&s;e does not him&s;elf undertake to remove them; for to grant a lea&s;e intitling the le&s;&s;ee to enter to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and yet to with-hold from him the means of obtaining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is an ab&s;urdity of which no rational man can be guilty.</P>
<P>A man who becomes bound to di&s;pone a debt, will by implied con|&s;ent be bound to convey every execution done upon it. And &s;uppo&s;e he has granted the a&s;&s;ignment without mentioning the execution, it is however under&s;tood to be convey'd by implied will.</P>
<P>A di&s;po&s;ition of an infeftment of annualrent mentioned only the real right, omitting a per&s;onal obligation that the debtor was under to pay the debt. The court judging that it was the intention of par|ties to put the di&s;ponee in place of the di&s;poner, without any view to

But it was under|&s;tood to be the intention of the cedent to put the a&s;&s;ignee in his place, without any view to relieve the debtor; and therefore his will to convey the inhibition along with the debt was implied <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Harcar&s;e, (A&s;&s;ignation), January 1682.

<P>When a man infefts his wife in land for &s;ecurity of her jointure payable in corn, it cannot be his intention, without any benefit to him&s;elf, to free his tenants from the obligation they are under to car|ry their farm-victual to the place of &s;ale; and therefore his will is implied to convey to his wife this &s;ervice of the tenants as a natural acce&s;&s;ory to her right <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 29th July 1680, Counte&s;s-dowager of Errol contra Earl of Errol.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The nicety in ca&s;es of this kind is, to determine from what circum|&s;tances will is to be implied. With re&s;pect to this point, peculiar atten|tion ought to be given to the purpo&s;ed end, and to what would have been the will of the parties had the thing occurred to them.

It is an acce&s;&s;ory of the &s;uperiority, but not &s;o connected but that it may be ea&s;ily disjoined. A reduction of this kind is a &s;evere puni&s;h|ment, which every one is not inclined to put in execution; and for that rea&s;on the conveyance of the privilege to the purcha&s;er ought to be expre&s;&s;ed, for it will not readily be implied <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Haddington, 14th February 1612, Wedderburn contra Nilbet.</NOTE>. If it would be wrong in a court of equity to imply a conveyance of any right or privilege without any rational pre&s;umption of the granter's will, it would be a &s;till greater wrong to decree any thing contradictory to the declared will; which, however, &s;eems to have been done in the following ca&s;e. The &s;um of L. 120 was given with an apprentice; and as the ma&s;ter was &s;ick when the articles were drawn, it was provided, that if he died within a year L. 60 &s;hould be returned.

three weeks, a bill was brought in chancery to have a greater &s;um returned. And though an expre&s;s provi&s;ion had been made with re|&s;pect to that very event, yet it was decreed that a hundred guineas &s;hould be returned <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Vernon 460.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Where a di&s;charge is granted of the principal debt, acce&s;&s;ories are under&s;tood to be comprehended by the implied will of the per&s;on who grants the di&s;charge. For example, an agent employ'd to carry on a proce&s;s, &s;tates an account without any article for his pains. He receives payment of the &s;um in the account, and grants a di&s;charge in full, without re&s;ervation of any claim for his pains. Under this di&s;charge will be comprehended the &s;aid claim, either as pa&s;&s;ed from, or as otherwi&s;e &s;atisfied. An implied di&s;charge is extended to a &s;till &s;traiter ca&s;e: an extract of a decree implies a pa&s;&s;ing from any claim for co&s;ts of &s;uit, however litigious the antagoni&s;t may have been; for no rational man will extract his decree if he have any view to claim co&s;ts of &s;uit.</P>

If there be no right created, a court of equity has not power, more than a court of common law, to &s;upply any defect. For this in effect would be to create a right; or, in other words, to make a will for a man who has made none for him&s;elf: a court of equity cannot make a deed for an individual, more than it can make a &s;ta|tute for the whole people.</P>

<P>A MAN believing his wife to be pregnant, left a legacy to a friend in the following terms; <Q REND="inline">"That if a male child was brought forth, the &s;um &s;hould be 4000 merks; if a female, 5000 merks."</Q> The wife produced no child; and the que&s;tion is, Whether any &s;um was due to the legatee, and what that &s;um &s;hould be? In this ca&s;e it is clear, that the te&s;tator intended a legacy to his friend in all events; for if the friend was to have a legacy even in ca&s;e of a child, much more if there &s;hould be no child. The que&s;tion then is, Whether omi&s;&s;ion by over&s;ight of the event that really happened, ought to di&s;appoint the te&s;tator's will, who in all events intended a legacy?

<HEAD><HI>ART. III.</HI> Where a &s;ettlement is made in the pro&s;pect of one event only, no other being fore&s;een; and in&s;tead of that event another happens.</HEAD>
<P>I GIVE an example that will be a key to the whole. An old ba|chelor, having no pro&s;pect of i&s;&s;ue becau&s;e he had no intention to marry, makes a &s;ettlement of his e&s;tate by di&s;poning the &s;ame to a near relation, and to a certain &s;eries of heirs, re&s;erving his own life|rent, with a power to alter. He takes a different thought, marries, and dies &s;uddenly, without altering his &s;ettlement, leaving his wife pregnant. A male child is born, and claims the e&s;tate. The &s;ettle|ment will be &s;upported at common law, becau&s;e the words are clear for the di&s;ponee. And as the granter's will is al&s;o for him in ex|pre&s;s terms, it is not obvious upon what principle a court of equity can interpo&s;e to overturn this &s;ettlement, without making a new will for a man who made none for him&s;elf. Yet, on the other hand, it would be a conclu&s;ion in law extremely har&s;h, to exheredate this favourite child, upon no better ground than a mere over&s;ight of his father, and to inforce a &s;ettlement in an event which the maker would avoid with horror were he alive. The following argument promi&s;es to extricate us from this dilemma. The will of the maker in favour of the di&s;ponee, is not ab&s;olute to take place in all events; but only upon &s;uppo&s;ition of what he took for granted, that he was to have no i&s;&s;ue. Therefore in the event that has happened the di&s;|ponee cannot &s;ay that the will of the maker is for him: con&s;equent|ly the &s;ettlement gives him no right. For the &s;ake of illu&s;tration, it may be added, that there is no difference in &s;ub&s;tance between a limited will, &s;uch as that under con&s;ideration, and a will that is conditional; for the binding act of the will is equally qualified by both: the difference is with re&s;pect to evidence only; the &s;ame act of will that is &s;aid to be limited when the limitation is left to be gathered from circum&s;tances, being termed <HI>conditional</HI> when the li|mitation is expre&s;&s;ed and not left upon circum&s;tances. For this rea|&s;on, a limited will cannot create a more exten&s;ive right than a will that is conditional. This doctrine is by no means new, though put in a new dre&s;s; for what el&s;e is an implied condition &s;o much talked of in the Roman law, but a limitation of will inferred from circum|&s;tances? Hence it follows, that the &s;ettlement under con&s;ideration is void in equity, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that it would be void even at common law, if the condition <Q REND="inline">"failing heirs of the granter's body"</Q> had been expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="146">
Another rea&s;on in equity concurs for voiding this &s;ettlement. The omi&s;&s;ion of the condition, <Q REND="inline">"failing heirs of the granter's body,"</Q> was plainly an over&s;ight; and the di&s;ponee ought not in con&s;cience to take advantage of that over&s;ight <HI>ad lucrum captandum.</HI> This follows from the rule above laid down, That <HI>in damno evitando</HI> one may take advantage of an error, but not <HI>in lucro captando.</HI></P>
<P>But where the child died in a few months, the &s;ettlement was &s;u&s;|tained; becau&s;e the child was not hurt by the &s;ettlement <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Next of kin of I&s;abel Watt contra I&s;abel Jervie, July 30. 1760.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The following ca&s;e is preci&s;ely of the &s;ame nature. A man having lent a &s;um, and taken a bond for the &s;ame, payable to him&s;elf, and to his children <HI>nominatim</HI> in fee, equally and proportionally, with this provi&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"That in ca&s;e of the decea&s;e of any of the &s;aid children, the &s;hare of the predecea&s;ing child &s;hall be equally divided among the &s;urvivors;"</Q> and one of the children, a &s;on, having predecea&s;ed his father, leaving i&s;&s;ue, the que&s;tion occurred, Whether his &s;hare of the bond did not, in terms of the &s;aid clau&s;e, accrue to the &s;urvivors, exclu&s;ive of his i&s;&s;ue. The court was of opinion, that the granter did not intend to exclude the i&s;&s;ue of any of his predecea&s;ing children; that he would have provided for &s;aid i&s;&s;ue had the event been fore&s;een; and upon that medium they preferred the i&s;&s;ue of the predecea&s;ing &s;on <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">November 21. 1738, Magi&s;trates of Montro&s;e contra Robert&s;on.</NOTE>.

For what if this event was really o|verlooked? Suppo&s;ing this to be the fact, we are left without a rea|&s;on. The &s;olid foundation of the opinion is, that a deed ought not to be made effectual in equity, when by over&s;ight it extends to an event that was not meant to be comprehended. So much ea&s;ier it is to judge or perceive what is right, than to give a &s;olid rea&s;on for our judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="147">
No per&s;on can he&s;itate about the application of this rule to unfore|&s;een events, which are brought about, not ca&s;ually, but by the per|&s;on in who&s;e favour the deed is granted. A man having no male i&s;|&s;ue, &s;ettled his whole e&s;tate, real and per&s;onal, upon his elde&s;t daugh|ter, with the following provi&s;o, That &s;he &s;hould pay 10,000 merks to her two &s;i&s;ters. The di&s;po&s;ition, being granted on deathbed, was challenged by the&s;e &s;i&s;ters, and voided as to the land-e&s;tate. The que&s;tion en&s;ued, Whether they who by their challenge got more than the 10,000 merks, had a claim for that &s;um over and above. They urged their father's expre&s;s will. But it being an&s;wered, That having overturned their father's will, they could not claim upon it; their claim was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, February 1. 1671, Pringle contra Pringle.</NOTE>. Here was not only an unexpected event, which would have been guarded again&s;t had it been fore&s;een; but further, the event, repugnant to the will of the granter, was the ope|ration of per&s;ons honoured by the deed, who&s;e ingratitude ju&s;tly bar|red them from taking any benefit by it. The following is a &s;imilar ca&s;e. John Earl of Dundonald, by a bond of entail, made a &s;ettle|ment of his land-e&s;tate on his heirs-male: at the &s;ame time he &s;ettled his moveables by will; and al&s;o executed bonds of provi&s;ion in favour of his daughters. The&s;e &s;everal deeds executed <HI>unico contextu,</HI> and re|maining with the granter undelivered, made a complete &s;ettlement of his e&s;tate real and per&s;onal; and proved it to be his intention, that his daughters &s;hould take nothing from him but their provi&s;ions. Af|ter the Earl's death, it being di&s;covered that &s;ome of the lands con|tained in his entail had not been ve&s;ted in him, but &s;till remained <HI>in hereditate jacente</HI> of a remote predece&s;&s;or, the daughters as heirs of line laid claim to the&s;e lands. It was objected, That they could not al&s;o claim their provi&s;ions, which were given them as being totally exclu|ded from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and as not otherwi&s;e provided; becau&s;e a deed calculated for one event cannot be effectual in another. <Q REND="inline">"The court judged, That the ladies could not claim their bonds of provi|&s;ion and likewi&s;e the lands as heirs of line; but that they might claim one or other at their option <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">February 20. 1729, Counte&s;s of Strathmore and Lady Katharine Cochran contra Mar|quis of Clyde&s;dale and Earl of Dundonald.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>From the doctrine thus illu&s;trated, it may be e&s;tabli&s;hed as another rule in equity, That a per&s;on honoured in a deed, who counteracts the will of the granter declared in the deed, can take no benefit by it.</P>
<P>Reflecting upon the foregoing doctrine, we perceive a remarkable difference between a donation completed by a transference of proper|ty,
<PB N="139" REF="148">
and a donation incompleted, which requires an action again&s;t the donor or his heirs. In the former ca&s;e, no unfore&s;een event will be &s;ufficient to re&s;tore the property to the donor: there is no principle of law nor of equity upon which &s;uch an action can be founded. In the latter ca&s;e, an unfore&s;een event makes it the duty of a court of equi|ty to deny action, and con&s;equently to render the donation ineffectual, unle&s;s the granter or his heir be &s;o &s;crupulou&s;ly moral, as of their own accord to fulfil it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rule holds where the granter is alive, &s;uppo&s;ing only he have put it out of his power to alter; for &s;o long as the deed is under his own power, he has no occa&s;ion for an equitable relief. When an obligation, relative to a certain event expected, is &s;ought to be made effectual in an unexpected event, a court of equity denies its authori|ty. This rule with re&s;pect to the living &s;hall be illu&s;trated by &s;everal examples. A di&s;po&s;ition of land granted by a man to his wife was ratified by the heir, who in the &s;ame deed bound him&s;elf to purge in|cumbrances affecting the land, <Q REND="inline">"upon the view and in contemplation of &s;ucceeding to the re&s;t of the e&s;tate,"</Q> as expre&s;&s;ed in the deed of ratification. The heir being charged by the widow to purge incum|brances, the following rea&s;on of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion was &s;u&s;tained, That the heir was excluded by an expired appri&s;ing of the whole e&s;tate, of which he was ignorant when he granted the ratification; and that this fact mu&s;t liberate him from his obligation, to grant which he could have no other motive but the pro&s;pect of enjoying the e&s;tate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, December 19. 1684, Home.

<P>Donations <HI>mortis cau&s;a</HI> are regulated by the &s;ame principle.

<HEAD>SECT. IV. A deed or covenant con&s;idered as a mean to an end.</HEAD>

For con&s;idering it to be a mean, the objection a|gain&s;t it is invincible, That no mean ought to be regarded but as far as it tends to accompli&s;h the end.

Though the vender be <HI>in bona fide,</HI> yet the purcha&s;er is re|lieved in equity from performance. Thus in purcha&s;ing wine for drinking, though I put my mark upon a particular hog&s;head as the product of a certain vineyard, to be delivered to me at a price named; yet if upon trial it prove &s;our, and be unfit for drinking, I am not bound to receive it however preci&s;e the bargain was.</P>
<P>A large cargo of &s;trong ale was purcha&s;ed from a brewer in Gla&s;|gow, in order to be exported to New York. In a &s;uit for the price the following defence was &s;u&s;tained, That it was not properly prepared for the heat of that climate; and that accordingly it had bur&s;ted the bottles, and was lo&s;t. It was not &s;uppo&s;ed that the brewer had been guilty of any wilful wrong; but this defence was &s;u&s;tained up|on the following rule of equity, That a man who purcha&s;es goods for a certain purpo&s;e, is not bound to receive them unle&s;s they an&s;wer that purpo&s;e; which holds <HI>a fortiori</HI> where the vender is him&s;elf the ma|nufacturer.

<P>An in&s;olvent debtor makes a tru&s;t-right in favour of his creditors; and among his other &s;ubjects, di&s;pones to the tru&s;tees his intere&s;t in a company-&s;tock. A &s;tranger, who by furni&s;hing goods to the com|pany became creditor to the bankrupt as one of the company, and
<PB N="141" REF="150">
likewi&s;e was clearly preferable upon the company-&s;tock before the bankrupt's private creditors, being ignorant of his preference, accedes to the tru&s;t-right, and con&s;ents to an equal di&s;tribution of the bank|rupt's effects. Being afterward informed of his preference, he re|tracts, while matters are yet entire. <HI>Quaer.</HI> Is he bound by his agree|ment? He undoubtedly draws by it all the benefit he had a pro&s;pect of; and con&s;idering the agreement &s;ingly, without relation to the end, he is bound; and &s;o &s;ays common law. But equity con&s;iders the end and purpo&s;e of the agreement; which is, that the &s;tranger &s;hall draw &s;uch proportion of the bankrupt's effects as he is intitled to by law. The means concerted, <HI>viz.</HI> that he &s;hall draw an equal proportion, contribute not to this end, but to one very different, <HI>viz.</HI> that he &s;hall draw le&s;s than what is ju&s;t, and the other creditors more. Equity re|lieves from an engagement where &s;uch is the unexpected re&s;ult; there being no authority from the intendment of parties to make it obliga|tory where it an&s;wers not the purpo&s;ed end.</P>
<P>Having laid open the foundation in equity for giving relief again&s;t a covenant where performance will not an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed by it, I proceed to examine whether there be any relief in equity after the covenant is fulfilled. I buy, for example, a lame hor&s;e unfit for work; but this defect is not di&s;covered till the hor&s;e is delivered, and the price paid. If the vender hath engaged to warrant the hor&s;e as &s;ufficient, he is liable at common law to fulfil his covenant. But &s;uppo&s;ing this paction not to have been interpo&s;ed, it appears to me not at all clear, that there is any foundation in equity for voiding the &s;ale thus completed. The hor&s;e is now my property by the purcha&s;e, and the price is equally the vender's property. If he knew that the hor&s;e was lame, he is guilty of a wrong that ought to &s;ubject him to the highe&s;t damages: but &s;uppo&s;ing him <HI>in bona &s;ide,</HI> I &s;ee no ground for any claim again&s;t him. The ground of equity that relieves me from paying for a hor&s;e that can be of no u&s;e, turns now again&s;t me in favour of the vender; for why &s;hould he be bound to take my hor&s;e that can be of no u&s;e to him, more than I was formerly bound to take his hor&s;e that could be of no u&s;e to me? The Roman law in|deed gave an <HI>actio redhibitoria</HI> in this ca&s;e, obliging the vender to take back the hor&s;e and to return the price. But I di&s;cover a rea&s;on for this practice in a principle of the Roman law, that will not &s;quare with our practice, nor with that of any other commercial nation. The principle is That &s;uch contracts as are intended to be equal, ought to an&s;wer the intention: and therefore in &s;uch contracts the Roman Pretor never permitted any con&s;iderable inequality. Hence the <HI>actio quanti minoris,</HI>
<PB N="142" REF="151">
which was given to a purcha&s;er who by ignorance or error paid more for a &s;ubject than it is intrin&s;ically worth: and it follows upon the &s;ame plan of equity, that if a &s;ubject be purcha&s;ed which is good for nothing, the <HI>actio quanti minoris</HI> mu&s;t re&s;olve into an <HI>actio redhibitoria.</HI> But equity may be carried &s;o far as to be prejudicial to commerce by encouraging law-&s;uits; and for that rea&s;on we admit not the <HI>actio quanti minoris:</HI> the principle of utility rejects it, experience having demon&s;trated that it is a great interruption to the free cour&s;e of commerce. The &s;ame principle of utility rejects the <HI>actio redhibitoria</HI> as far as founded on inequality; and after a &s;ale is completed by deli|very, I have endeavoured to &s;how, that if inequality be laid a&s;ide, there is no foundation for the <HI>actio redhibitoria.</HI> In Scotland, however, though the <HI>actio quanti minoris</HI> is rejected, the <HI>actio redhibitoria</HI> is ad|mitted where a latent in&s;ufficiency unqualifies the &s;ubject for the end with a view to which it was purcha&s;ed. This practice, as appears to me, is out of all rule. If we adhere &s;trictly to equity without regard|ing utility, we ought to &s;u&s;tain the <HI>actio quanti minoris</HI> as well as the <HI>actio redhibitoria.</HI> But if we give way to utility, the great law in com|mercial dealings, we ought to &s;u&s;tain neither. To indulge di&s;putes about the true value of every commercial &s;ubject would de&s;troy com|merce: and for that rea&s;on, equity, which has no other object but the intere&s;t of a &s;ingle per&s;on, mu&s;t yield to utility, which regards the whole &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The doctrine above delivered will be finely illu&s;trated by applying it to erroneous payment, or <HI>&s;olutio indebiti,</HI> which makes a great figure in the Roman law. Of erroneous payment there are two kinds clear|ly di&s;tingui&s;hable from each other: one where a debt is erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t that is extingui&s;hed, or perhaps never exi&s;ted; and one where there is really a debt, but the per&s;on who pays is not debtor.</P>
<P>To explain what equity dictates with re&s;pect to erroneous payment of the fir&s;t kind, &s;everal ca&s;es &s;hall be &s;tated that give light to each other. I begin with the ca&s;e of a bonded debt, which, after being extingui&s;hed by payment, is purcha&s;ed <HI>bona fide</HI> for a valuable con&s;i|deration; and the debtor's heir, ignorant of the extinction, grants a bond of corroboration to the a&s;&s;ignee. After the granting this bond of corroboration, but before payment, the extinction of the bond corroborated comes to be di&s;covered; and, to make the que&s;tion of importance, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e that the cedent or a&s;&s;ignor becomes bankrupt after the date of the bond of corroboration. Both parties here are <HI>certantes de dammo evitando:</HI> if the bond of corroboration be
<PB N="143" REF="152">
made effectual, the debtor is forc'd to pay a debt that is not due: if on the other hand he be relieved from it, the a&s;&s;ignee lo&s;es the valu|able con&s;ideration he paid to the cedent. What does equity rule in this ca&s;e? Upon the principle above laid down, it relieves again&s;t the bond of corroboration. A corroborative &s;ecurity is not intended to create a new debt, but only to &s;ecure the payment of one already due; and therefore no claim can in equity be founded on the bond of corroboration independent of the debt corroborated: if the debt corroborated be imaginary, the bond of corroboration mu&s;t go for nothing: it po&s;&s;ibly may be worded in ab&s;olute terms, <HI>viz.</HI> to pay the &s;um &s;tipulated at a preci&s;e day; but words again&s;t or beyond in|tention cannot operate in equity. For this rea&s;on I cannot agree to the following opinion: <Q REND="inline">"Si quis indebitam pecuniam, per errorem, ju&s;&s;u mulieris, &s;pon&s;o ejus promi&s;i&s;&s;et, et nuptiae &s;ecutae fui&s;&s;ent, ex|ceptione doli mali uti non pote&s;t. Maritus enim &s;uum negotium gerit; et nihil dolo facit, nec decipiendus e&s;t: quod fit, &s;i cogatur indotatam uxorem habere. Itaque adver&s;us mulierem condictio ei competit, ut aut repetat ab ea quod marito dedit, aut ut liberetur, &s;i nondum &s;olverit <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. 9. &sect; 1. De condic. cau&s;a data.</NOTE>."</Q> This rea&s;oning is not &s;atisfactory. The hu&s;band indeed is not <HI>in mala fide</HI> to demand what is promi&s;ed him; but neither is his party <HI>in mala fide</HI> for refu&s;ing to pay a debt a &s;econd time: and equity will not compel a man to perform a promi&s;e, when performance cannot an&s;wer the end for which the promi&s;e was made.</P>
<P>Let us next &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;um contained in the bond of corro|boration is actually paid. Whether in this ca&s;e is the a&s;&s;ignee bound to re&s;tore the money, when it is di&s;covered that the debt corrobora|ted was imaginary, and that nothing was due? Neither equity nor common law gives relief in this ca&s;e. The property of the money paid is transferred to the a&s;&s;ignee; and it is an inviolable rule of e|quity as well as of common law. That no man can be forfeited of his property who is guilty of no fault. Neither is the money in his hand <HI>&s;ine cau&s;a,</HI> for the &s;um he gave to the cedent is a ju&s;t cau&s;e.

What is &s;aid above will clear|ly &s;how, that the following deci&s;ion is erroneous. An executor-credi|tor having confirmed a debt as due to the decea&s;ed, and having upon that title obtained payment from the debtor's heir, was decerned to re&s;tore the money, it being afterward di&s;covered, that the debt had been paid to the original creditor <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, Gosford, January 10. 1673, Ram|&s;ay contra Robert&s;on.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>CONTRACTS &s;hall furni&s;h the fir&s;t examples. In a bargain of &s;ale, the price is referred to a third party: the referee dies &s;uddenly without determining the price; and there is no performance on either &s;ide. There being no remedy here at common law, becau&s;e the price is not a&s;certained, can a court of equity &s;upply the defect in order to make the bargain effectual? This que&s;tion depends upon what the parties intended by the reference. If they intended not to be bound but by the opinion of the referee, it is in effect a conditional bargain, never purified; according to which con&s;truction there is no place for equity, becau&s;e there is no defect in the bargain, nor any right created to either party. But if the parties intended that the &s;ale &s;hould in all events be effectual, which will be pre&s;umed as the more rational con&s;truction, a right upon that &s;uppo&s;ition is created to each party, intitling the one to the &s;ubject and the other to the value; and it is the duty of a court of equity to make the&s;e rights ef|fectual, by &s;upplying the defect, and naming a price <HI>&s;ecundum arbitrium boni viri.</HI></P>
<P>A man having purcha&s;ed land, gave a backbond obliging him|&s;elf to redi&s;pone, upon the vender's repaying the price within a time limited.

It was an&s;wered, That by the deed of mortification a&s;&s;igning the funds to tru&s;tees for the u&s;e of the &s;chool|ma&s;ters of Weem, a right was ve&s;ted in the&s;e &s;choolma&s;ters, which the tru&s;tees, by not-acceptance, could not defeat; and that &s;uppo&s;e the whole of them had refu&s;ed to accept, an action would lie again&s;t them at the in&s;tance of the &s;choolma&s;ter, to denude in favour of o|ther tru&s;tees to be named by the court.

The referees having declined to accept the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, the que&s;tion occurred between the heir and younger children, Whether the powers of the referees were devolved upon the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion to determine provi&s;ions to the younger children <HI>&s;ecundum arbitrium boni viri;</HI> or whether the younger children were to be left to the claim they had by the contract of marriage?

cannot be ju&s;tified upon any ground other than that of hold|ing the determination of the Duke of Argyle and Earl of Ilay as a condition, without which the children were not to have a provi&s;ion. The &s;ettlement appears to me in a different light. The Colonel's will to provide his younger children in all events, is clearly expre&s;&s;ed. As he was doubtful what the &s;um &s;hould be in ca&s;e their mother in|&s;i&s;ted upon her jointure, he left it upon the referees to name the &s;um, not doubting their acceptance. This reference I con&s;ider to be the means cho&s;en by the Colonel for accompli&s;hing his purpo&s;e of pro|viding his children; but not &s;o as to exclude all other means. His younger children were intitled to a provi&s;ion by his will; and failing the means cho&s;en by him for a&s;certaining the extent, ju&s;tice required that other means &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tituted, in order to make their claim effectual. This ca&s;e re&s;embles very much that above mentioned concerning a &s;um &s;ettled upon tru&s;tees for the u&s;e of the &s;choolma|&s;ters of Weem. The &s;ettlement upon tru&s;tees was a means only for making the mortification effectual; and the failure of the tru|&s;tees could have no other effect but to make way for &s;upplying other means.</P>

<P>JAMES THOMSON, in his marriage-contract, provides his e&s;tate and conque&s;t to the heirs of the marriage.

The bankrupt's creditors, after the father's death, brought a reduction of this &s;ettlement, as in defraud of the marriage-contract.

<P>A GRATUITOUS bond by a minor being voided at the in&s;tance of his heir, becau&s;e a minor cannot bind him&s;elf without a valuable con&s;ideration, the obligee in&s;i&s;ted for an equivalent out of the move|ables left by the minor, upon the following ground, That the bond implied a legacy, which the minor could have granted by making a te&s;tament. It was yielded, that if the heir's challenge had been fore|&s;een, the minor would probably have given a legacy in&s;tead of the bond; but that as the minor had not exerted any act of will with re|&s;pect to a legacy, the court could not make a te&s;tament for a man who had not made one for him&s;elf. The court accordingly refu&s;ed to tran&s;ub&s;tantiate the bond into a legacy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, December 15. 1698, Straiton contra Wight.</NOTE>. In this ca&s;e, as it ap|pears to me, the <HI>ratio decidendi</HI> is taken from common law, not from equity. One thing &s;eems clear, that the minor intended in all events to be&s;tow the &s;um named upon his friend the obligee; for if he was willing to bind him&s;elf per&s;onally to pay the &s;um, he could not have the lea&s;t he&s;itation to bind his repre&s;entatives by bequeathing it as a le|gacy. And if this be admitted, the con&s;equence is fair, that the friend thereby acquired a right, which it was the duty of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion to make effectual, by &s;u&s;taining a claim again&s;t the execu|tor in the &s;ame manner as if the &s;um had been a legacy. Con&s;idering this matter in a different light, I can di&s;cover no good rea&s;on why a minor, who can di&s;po&s;e of his moveables by te&s;tament, may not do the &s;ame in the form of a bond, dropping only the clau&s;es that are more beneficial to the obligee than a legacy would be. So far a bond may be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as a virtual legacy.</P>
<P>A gratuitous di&s;po&s;ition of an heritable &s;ubject being voided be|cau&s;e granted on deathbed, the di&s;ponee claimed the value from the executor, pre&s;uming that the decea&s;ed would have given an equiva|lent had he fore&s;een the event.

Fountain|hall, November 22. 1698, Cummin contra Cummin.</NOTE>. This judgement mu&s;t be approved; for it is far from being clear that the value of the heritable &s;ubject was intended in all events to be made effectual to the di&s;ponee. It may be a man's will to alien from his
<PB N="150" REF="159">
heir an heritable &s;ubject, though he would not burden his executors with the value, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be a number of younger children. This argument goes on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the di&s;poner knew the &s;ubject to be heritable. But what if by mi&s;take he took it to be moveable? This is more doubtful. And yet even upon that &s;uppo|&s;ition it would be bold to give an equivalent; becau&s;e a man may have motives for be&s;towing upon his friend a certain &s;ubject, who would not be di&s;po&s;ed to burden either his heir or executor with an equivalent &s;um.</P>
<P>The rea&s;oning here coincides with that in the Roman law about a <HI>legatum rei alienae.</HI> If the te&s;tator leave a &s;pecial legacy of a &s;ubject, believed to be his own, which after his death is di&s;covered to belong to a &s;tranger; the heir is not bound to give an equivalent, becau&s;e here <HI>deficit voluntas te&s;tatoris.</HI> This in other words is &s;aying as above, That it is not clear the te&s;tator intended in all events either the lega|cy or its value: the &s;ubject legated may be con&s;iderable; and po&s;&s;ibly the te&s;tator would not have left it in legacy had he not con&s;idered it as making part of his &s;tock. But if the te&s;tator knew that the &s;ub|ject belonged to another, it mu&s;t have been his will and intention, if he did not mean to play the fool, that it &s;hould be purcha&s;ed by his heir for the legatee; and upon that &s;uppo&s;ition a right is created in the legatee, which ought to be made effectual by a court of equity.</P>
<P>A man makes a &s;ettlement of his e&s;tate on his elde&s;t &s;on in tail, with a power, by deed or will under &s;eal, to charge the lands with any &s;um not exceeding L. 500. He prepares a deed, and gets it in|gro&s;&s;ed, by which he appoints the L. 500 to his younger children, but dies before it is &s;igned or &s;ealed; yet this in equity &s;hall amount to a good execution of his power, the &s;ub&s;tance being performed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abridg. ca&s;es in equity, ch. 44. &s;ect.

The power he re&s;erved of charging the e|&s;tate by deed or will under &s;eal, was not intended to make their right conditional, but to give them the highe&s;t &s;ecurity that is known in law. This &s;ecurity was indeed di&s;appointed by the man's &s;udden death; but he had &s;ufficiently declared his purpo&s;e of giving them L. 500, which afforded them a good claim in equity for that &s;um.</P>

But the Provo&s;t, being taken &s;uddenly ill, died on the 24th of June, a few hours before the expre&s;s arrived at Aberdeen; by which means it happened, that the di&s;po&s;ition was not delivered to him, nor the bond for the price grant|ed by him. This unfore&s;een accident gave ri&s;e to a que&s;tion between Robert, the Provo&s;t's elde&s;t &s;on and heir, and the &s;aid Alexander &s;on of the &s;econd marriage.

<P>A variety of irritancies contrived to &s;ecure an entail again&s;t acts and deeds of the proprietor, furni&s;h proper examples for illu&s;trating this article. Irritancies directed again&s;t the tenant in tail to re&s;train him from de&s;troying the entail, are in effect re&s;olutive conditions; and if &s;o expre&s;&s;ed as to declare the right voidable only, and not void <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> any act of contravention may be purged before challenge, and even at any time before &s;entence upon a proce&s;s of declarator. The difficulty ari&s;es from clau&s;es declaring the contravener to fall from his right <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> upon the fir&s;t act of contravention. One thing is clear, that the entailer's will mu&s;t be obey'd; and therefore, if his meaning be truly expre&s;&s;ed in an <HI>ip&s;o &s;acto</HI> forfeiting clau&s;e, no court can re&s;tore the tenant in tail again&s;t the forfeiture. But &s;uppo|&s;ing the entailer to have only intended by this forfeiting clau&s;e to keep his heirs of entail to their duty, which <HI>in dubio</HI> will always be pre&s;umed; it may be doubted whether a court of equity ought not to interpo&s;e to relieve the tenant in tail from the forfeiture, upon his freeing the e&s;tate from his debts and deeds. On the one hand, we have the entailer's will declaring that an act of contravention &s;hall operate a forfeiture <HI>ip&s;o facto.</HI> But what weighs on the other hand is, that &s;uch irritancies being intended <HI>in terrorem</HI> only, and to pre&s;erve the e&s;tate entire to the heirs named in their order, the entailer's ulti|mate intention is fulfilled if the e&s;tate be relieved from the debts and deeds of the tenant in tail, and is di&s;appointed if the forfeiture be per|mitted to have its full effect. Here then we have the entailer's will with re&s;pect to the means contradicted by his intention with regard to the end, &s;o as that both cannot be obey'd: which, upon the ma|xim That the end ought to be preferred before the means, affords a
<PB N="153" REF="162">
fair opportunity for a court of equity to confine the operation of the&s;e means, &s;o as to produce no effect beyond what is ultimately intended. This re&s;olves into a general propo&s;ition, <Q REND="inline">"That where the means con|certed reach inadvertently too far, it belongs to a court of equity to deny any effect to the&s;e means beyond what is ultimately purpo&s;ed."</Q> And accordingly it is always the practice of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, as a court of equity, to &s;u&s;tain the offer of purging or freeing the e&s;tate, in order to relieve from the forfeiture.</P>
<P>The act 1685 concerning tailzies declares, <Q REND="inline">"That if the provi&s;ions and irritant clau&s;es are not repeated in the rights and conveyances by which the heirs of tailzie bruik or enjoy the e&s;tate, the omi&s;&s;ion &s;hall import a contravention of the irritant and re&s;olutive clau&s;es again&s;t the per&s;on and his heirs who &s;hall omit to in&s;ert the &s;ame, whereby the e&s;tate &s;hall <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> fall, accre&s;ce, and be devolved up|on the next heir of tailzie; but &s;hall not militate again&s;t creditors,"</Q> &amp;c. If the will of the legi&s;lature here expre&s;&s;ed is to be &s;trictly obey'd, the forfeiture mu&s;t take place, without admitting the tenant in tail to &s;upply the omi&s;&s;ion by ingro&s;&s;ing the irritant clau&s;es in his title-deeds: nor would the &s;tronge&s;t evidence given on his part of ig|norance or ca&s;ual omi&s;&s;ion, relieve him from the forfeiture. But as the clau&s;e mu&s;t be con&s;tructed to be only <HI>in terrorem,</HI> it would contra|dict the ultimate purpo&s;e of the legi&s;lature, to give it any effect, fur|ther than to oblige the tenant in tail to &s;upply his omi&s;&s;ion; for we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that the legi&s;lature intended to be more rigid in &s;ecu|ring entails, than entailers them&s;elves commonly are. This &s;ta|tutory irritancy, according to &s;trict order, ought to come in afterward, in treating of equity with re&s;pect to &s;tatutes; but it appears in a bet|ter light by being joined with the irritancies above mentioned.</P>
<P>The irritancies hitherto mentioned relate to grants and &s;ingle deeds. I proceed to an example of a conventional irritancy, <HI>viz.</HI> an irritancy <HI>ob non &s;olutum canonem</HI> contained in a tack or feu-right. Such a clau&s;e expre&s;&s;ed &s;o as to make the right voidable only upon failure of pay|ment, is ju&s;t and equal; becau&s;e, by a declarator of irritancy, it &s;e|cures to the &s;uperior or landlord payment of what is due him, and at the &s;ame time affords to the va&s;&s;al or tenant an opportunity to purge the irritancy by payment. And even &s;uppo&s;ing the clau&s;e &s;o expre&s;&s;ed as to make failure of payment an <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> forfeiture, it will be held by a court of equity, that the means cho&s;en reach inadvertently beyond the ultimate intention of the parties contracters; and a declarator of irritancy will &s;till be nece&s;&s;ary, in order to afford an opportunity of purging the irritancy.</P>

<P>Conditional bonds and grants afford good examples of limiting means when they exceed ju&s;t bounds. Conditional bonds and grants are of two kinds. One is where the condition is ultimate; as for example, a bond for money granted to a young woman upon condi|tion of her being married to a man named, or a bond for money to a young man upon condition of his entering into holy orders. The o|ther is where the condition is a means to a certain end; as for ex|ample, a bond for a &s;um of money to a young woman upon condi|tion of her marrying with con&s;ent of certain friends named, the in|tendment of which condition is to prevent an un&s;uitable match. Conditions of the fir&s;t kind are taken &s;trictly, and the &s;um is not due unle&s;s the condition be purified. This is requi&s;ite in common law; and not le&s;s &s;o in equity, becau&s;e ju&s;tice requires that a man's will be made effectual. To judge aright of the other kind, we ought to lay the chief weight upon the ultimate purpo&s;e of the granter; which, in the ca&s;e la&s;t mentioned, is to confine the young woman to a &s;uit|able match. If &s;he therefore marry &s;uitably, or, &s;uppo&s;e, above her rank, though without con&s;ulting the friends named, I pronounce that the bond ought to be effectual in equity, though not at common law. The rea&s;on that determines my opinion is given above, that weight ought to be laid upon the ultimate purpo&s;e, even in oppo&s;i|tion to the declared means; and that ju&s;tice is fulfilled when the granter's ultimate purpo&s;e is made effectual. I am aware, that in Scotland we are taught a different doctrine. In bonds of the kind under con&s;ideration, a di&s;tinction is made between a &s;u&s;pen&s;ive con|dition, and one that is re&s;olutive. If the bond to the young woman contain a re&s;olutive condition only, <HI>viz. if &s;he marry without con&s;ent &s;he &s;hall forfeit the bond,</HI> it is admitted, that the forfeiture will not take effect unle&s;s &s;he marry un&s;uitably. But it is held by every one, that a &s;u&s;pen&s;ive condition, &s;uch as that above mentioned, mu&s;t be performed in the preci&s;e terms of the clau&s;e; becau&s;e, &s;ay they, the will of the granter mu&s;t be the rule; and no court has power to vary a conditional grant, or to transform it into one that is pure and
<PB N="155" REF="164">
&s;imple. This argument is conclu&s;ive where a condition is ultimate, whether &s;u&s;pen&s;ive or re&s;olutive; but far otherwi&s;e where the condi|tion is a means to an end. It is true, that the will of the granter mu&s;t be the rule: but it mu&s;t be his ultimate will or intention, in oppo&s;i|tion to his will with re&s;pect to di&s;proportioned means. Let us try the force of this rea&s;oning, by bringing it down to common apprehen&s;ion. Why is a re&s;olutive condition di&s;regarded, where the obligee marries &s;uitably? For what other rea&s;on, but that this re&s;olutive condition is con&s;idered as a means to an end, and that if the end be accompli&s;h|ed the granter's purpo&s;e is fulfilled? Is not this rea&s;oning applicable equally to the &s;u&s;pen&s;ive condition under con&s;ideration? No man of plain under&s;tanding, unacquainted with law, will di&s;cover any differ|ence. And accordingly, in the later practice of the Engli&s;h court of chancery, this difference &s;eems to be di&s;regarded. A portion of L. 8000 is given to a woman provided &s;he marry with con&s;ent of A; and if &s;he marry without his con&s;ent, &s;he &s;hall have but L. 100 year|ly. She was relieved though &s;he married without con&s;ent; for the provi&s;o is <HI>in terrorem</HI> only <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abridg. ca&s;es in equity, chap. 17. &s;ect. C. 1.</NOTE>.</P>

The court may enlarge the time for payment, though the premi&s;es are devi&s;ed over. And in all ca&s;es where compen&s;ation can be made for the delay, the court may di&s;|pen&s;e with the time, though even in the ca&s;e of a condition prece|dent <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. &s;ect. B. &sect; 5.</NOTE>. This practical rule is evidently derived from the rea&s;oning above &s;tated.</P>
<P>Take another example that comes under the &s;ame rule of equity. A claim is tran&s;acted, and a le&s;s &s;um accepted, upon condition that the &s;ame be paid at a day certain, otherwi&s;e the tran&s;action to be void. It is the general opinion, that where the clau&s;e is re&s;olutive, equity will relieve again&s;t it after the &s;tipulated term is elap&s;ed, pro|vided the tran&s;acted &s;um be paid before proce&s;s be rai&s;ed; but it is denied that this will hold where the clau&s;e is &s;u&s;pen&s;ive. In my ap|prehen&s;ion, there is an equitable ground for relief in both equally. The form may be different, but the intention is the &s;ame in both, <HI>viz.</HI> to compel payment of the tran&s;acted &s;um; and therefore if pay|ment be offered at any time before a declarator of irritancy, with
<PB N="156" REF="165">
damages for the delay, the conditional irritancy has had the full effect that was ultimately intended. Equity therefore requires a de|clarator of irritancy, whether the clau&s;e be &s;u&s;pen&s;ive or re&s;olutive; and the defendant ought to be admitted to purge the failure by offer|ing payment of the tran&s;acted &s;um. The ca&s;e, I acknowledge, is different where the tran&s;acted &s;um is to be paid in parcels, and at different periods; as for example, where an annuity is tran&s;acted for a le&s;s yearly &s;um. A court of equity will &s;carce interpo&s;e in this ca&s;e, but leave the irritancy to take place <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> by the rules of common law; for if the irritant clau&s;e be not in this ca&s;e permitted to operate <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> it will be altogether ineffectual, and be no com|pul&s;ion to make payment. If a declarator be nece&s;&s;ary, the defend|ant mu&s;t be admitted to purge before &s;entence; and if it be at all nece&s;&s;ary, it mu&s;t be renewed every term where there is a failure of payment. This would be unju&s;t, becau&s;e it reduces the creditor to the &s;ame difficulties of recovering his tran&s;acted &s;um that he had with re&s;pect to his original &s;um; which, in effect, is to forfeit the creditor for his moderation, in&s;tead of forfeiting the debtor for his ingratitude.</P>
<P>The examples above given coincide in the following point, That the acts of contravention are capable of being purged, &s;o as to re|&s;tore matters to the &s;ame &s;ituation as if there had been no contraven|tion. But there are acts incapable of being purged, &s;uch as the cutting down trees by a tenant. Now, &s;uppo&s;e a lea&s;e be granted with a clau&s;e of forfeiture in ca&s;e of felling trees, will equity relieve again&s;t this forfeiture in any ca&s;e? If the act of contravention was done knowingly, and con&s;equently criminally, there can be no equi|ty in giving relief; but if it was done ignorantly and innocently, a court of equity ought to interpo&s;e again&s;t the forfeiture, upon ma|king up full damages to the landlord. Take the following in&s;tance. The plaintiff, tenant for life of a copy-hold e&s;tate, felled trees, which, at a court-baron, was found a wa&s;te, and con&s;equently a forfeiture. The bill was to be relieved again&s;t the forfeiture, offering &s;atisfaction if it appeared to be a wa&s;te. The court decreed an i&s;&s;ue, to try whe|ther the primary intention in felling the trees was to do wa&s;te; de|claring, that in ca&s;e of a wilful forfeiture it would not relieve <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Chancery ca&s;es 95.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. Where there is a failure in performance.</HEAD>
<DIV5 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>ART. I.</HI> Where the failure is total.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to di&s;tingui&s;h equity from common law upon this &s;ub|ject, we mu&s;t begin with examining what power a court of common law has to compel per&s;ons to fulfil their engagements. That this court has not power to decree &s;pecific performance, is an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim in England, founded upon the following rea&s;on. In every engagement there mu&s;t be a term &s;pecified for performance: before that term there can be no demand for performance, nor any proce&s;s brought upon that head; and after the term is pa&s;t, per|formance at that preci&s;e term becomes impre&s;table. A court of com|mon law, confined to the words of a deed or covenant, hath not power to &s;ub&s;titute equivalents; and therefore all that can be done by &s;uch a court, is to award damages again&s;t the party who fails to perform. Even a bond of borrowed money is not an exception; for after the term of payment, the &s;um is ordered to be paid by a court of common law, not as performance of the obligation, but as da|mage for not performance. This, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, is a great defect; for the obvious intention of the parties in making a co|venant, is not to have damages, but performance. The defect ought to be &s;upplied; and it is &s;upplied by a court of equity upon a prin|ciple often mentioned, That where there is a right it ought to be made effectual. By every covenant that is not conditional, there is a right acquired to each party: a term &s;pecified for performance is a mean to a&s;certain performance, not a condition; and when that mean fails, it is the duty of a court of equity to &s;upply another mean, that is to name another day.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this doctrine, &s;everal ca&s;es &s;hall be &s;tated with re&s;pect to the performance of a covenant. In a minute of &s;ale of land, a term is named for entering the purcha&s;er into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and for pay|ment of the price. By &s;ome accident, the matter lies over till the term is pa&s;t, without a demand on either &s;ide. At common law the minute of &s;ale is rendered ineffectual; becau&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion cannot be delivered at the term covenanted, nor the price paid after that term is elap&s;ed: neither can damage be awarded for non-performance, becau&s;e neither party has been <HI>in mora.</HI> It belongs then to a
<PB N="158" REF="167">
court of equity to a&s;&s;ign a new term for &s;pecific performance, which is fulfilling the purpo&s;e of the covenant, and making the rights ari&s;ing therefrom effectual. At the &s;ame time, it ought not to be overlooked, that the naming a new term for performance mu&s;t vary the articles of the original agreement. The price cannot bear intere&s;t from the term named in the minute, becau&s;e the purcha&s;er was not bound to pay the price until he &s;hould get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: nor is the vender liable to account for the rents from that term, becau&s;e he could not be bound to yield po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till the price was offered. The&s;e &s;everal pre&s;tations mu&s;t take place from the new term named by the court of equity.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing now a <HI>mora</HI> on one &s;ide. The purcha&s;er, for example, demands performance of the minute of &s;ale at the term &s;tipulated; and years pa&s;s in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the vender's defences. The&s;e at la&s;t are repelled, and the purcha&s;er in&s;i&s;ts for &s;pecific performance. What doth equity &s;ugge&s;t in this ca&s;e? for now, the term of performance being pa&s;t, the original articles cannot be fulfilled. One thing is e|vident, that the purcha&s;er mu&s;t not &s;uffer by the vender's failure: and therefore a court of equity, though it mu&s;t name a new term for per|formance, may, however, if the purcha&s;er in&s;i&s;t upon it, appoint an account to be made upon the footing of the original articles. If the rent, for example, exceed the intere&s;t of the money, the balance may be ju&s;tly claimed by the purcha&s;er, becau&s;e he would have had the benefit of that exce&s;s if the vender had performed as he ought to have done. But what if the intere&s;t of the price, as u&s;ual, exceed the neat rent? The vender will not be intitled to the difference; for the purcha&s;er was not bound to pay the price till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was offered him, and he could not be liable for intere&s;t before the prin|cipal &s;um was due. In a word, the purcha&s;er has a claim for da|mage in the former ca&s;e; becau&s;e, where the rent exceeds the inter|e&s;t, he can qualify damage by the delay of performance. But in the latter ca&s;e, where the intere&s;t exceeds the rent, the purcha&s;er, in|&s;tead of lo&s;ing, gains by the delay, and upon that account has no damage to claim. This at fir&s;t view may be thought to cla&s;h with the maxim <HI>Cujus commodum ejus debet e&s;&s;e incommodum:</HI> doth it not &s;eem unju&s;t, that the purcha&s;er &s;hould have an option to claim the rents from the beginning, or only from the pre&s;ent time, as be&s;t &s;uits his intere&s;t? It may &s;eem &s;o at fir&s;t view, but there is no inju|&s;tice in reality: the purcha&s;er's option ari&s;eth ju&s;tly from the failure of his party; which &s;hows that the foregoing maxim obtains between per&s;ons only who are upon an equal footing, not where
<PB N="159" REF="168">
the one is guilty of a fault re&s;pecting the other. I need &s;carce add, that the &s;ame option which is given to the purcha&s;er where the vender is <HI>in mora,</HI> is given to the vender where the purcha&s;er is <HI>in mora.</HI></P>
<P>It frequently happens that &s;pecific performance becomes impre&s;t|able; as where I &s;ell the &s;ame hor&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to A and B. In this ca&s;e the performance to A becomes impre&s;table after the hor&s;e is de|livered to B; and therefore, in&s;tead of decreeing &s;pecific perform|ance, the court of equity mu&s;t be &s;atisfied, like a court of common law, to decree damages, according to the maxim <HI>Quod loco facti im|prae&s;tabilis &s;uccedit damnum et intere&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;ugge&s;ts an enquiry, Whether in awarding damages there be any difference between a court of equity and a court of common law. The obligor being bound to perform what he undertakes, ought from the very nature of his obligation to make up the lo&s;s occa&s;ioned by his failure; and every failure accordingly will afford a good claim for damages at common law. Thus the purcha&s;er of an e&s;tate from an heir-apparent, having, along with the di&s;po&s;ition, received a procuratory to &s;erve and infeft his author, employs his own doer to perform that work. By the doer's remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, the heir-apparent dies without being infeft, which renders the di&s;po&s;ition ineffectual to the purcha&s;er. The doer is bound at common law to make up the pur|cha&s;er's lo&s;s, though it be <HI>lucrum ce&s;&s;ans</HI> only. In ca&s;es of that nature, if &s;kill be profe&s;&s;ed, un&s;kilfulne&s;s will afford no defence. <Q REND="inline">"Proculus ait, &s;i medicus &s;ervum imperite &s;ecuerit, vel locato vel ex lege Aqui|la competere actionem <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 7. &sect; 8. ad legem Aquil.</NOTE>.

An advocate being indebted a con&s;iderable &s;um to his client, wrote and delivered him a bill of exchange for the &s;um. Being &s;ued for payment, he objected that the bill was null, as containing a penalty. It is probable that the advocate was ignorant of this nullity when he drew the bill; but he undertook the tru&s;t of drawing it, and therefore was bound to make it effectual to his client <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">November 26. 1743, Garden of Troup contra Thomas Rigg advocate.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When a pri&s;oner for debt makes an e&s;cape, the creditor is hurt in his intere&s;t, but &s;u&s;tains no actual damage; for it is not certain that
<PB N="160" REF="169">
he would have recovered his money by detaining the debtor in pri|&s;on; and it is po&s;&s;ible he may yet recover it, notwith&s;tanding the e|&s;cape. But it is undoubtedly a hurt or prejudice to be deprived of his expectation to obtain payment by the impri&s;onment; and the common law gives reparation by making the negligent jailor liable for the debt, preci&s;ely as equity doth in &s;imilar ca&s;es. A me&s;&s;enger who neglects to put a caption in execution, affords another in&s;tance of the &s;ame kind. By his negligence he is &s;aid <HI>litem &s;uam facere,</HI> and is &s;ubjected to the debt. The undertaking an office implies an agree|ment to fulfil the duty of the office in all its branches; and negligence accordingly is a breach of agreement, which mu&s;t &s;ubject the officer to all the con&s;equences, whether actual damage or any other preju|dice. It ought not to e&s;cape ob&s;ervation at the &s;ame time, that as neglect merely without intention of mi&s;chief is no ground for puni&s;h|ment, damages are the only means within the compa&s;s of law for compelling a man to be diligent in performing his duty.</P>
<P>Certain covenants unknown in the common law belong to equity. A bill of exchange was of that nature, till it was brought under the common law by act of parliament; and while it continued in its ori|ginal &s;tate, damages from failure of performance could not be claim|ed but in a court of equity. A policy of in&s;urance is to this day un|known at common law; and con&s;equently every wrong relative to it mu&s;t be redre&s;&s;ed in a court of equity.</P>
<P>And now as to the rules for e&s;timating damage upon failure to perform a covenant. A failure to perform any duty, whether ari&s;ing from a covenant or not, is a fault only, not a crime; and therefore, according to what is laid down above <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 78. 79.</NOTE>, no con&s;equential damage that is uncertain ought to be claimed. There is the greater rea&s;on for this moderation with re&s;pect to covenants, where the failure is frequently occa&s;ioned by a very &s;light fault, and &s;ometimes by inabi|lity without any fault. This rule is adopted by the writers on the Roman law: <Q REND="inline">"Cum per venditorem &s;teterit quo minus rem tradat, omnis utilitas emptoris in ae&s;timationem venit: quae modo circa ip&s;am rem con&s;i&s;tit.

<P>In comparing the rule laid down in this ca&s;e for e&s;timating damage, with that mentioned above concerning a jailor and a me&s;&s;enger, there is an appearance as if uncertain damage, rejected in the former, were admitted in the latter; and this may be thought an incon&s;i&s;tency in the rule here laid down for e&s;timating damage. But this difficulty will be removed by a &s;ingle ob&s;ervation, That uncertain damage is not admitted in either ca&s;e. The ri&s;k a creditor runs upon e&s;cape of his pri&s;oner is extremely certain, however uncertain the con&s;equences may be. It is this ri&s;k only that is e&s;timated; and it is e&s;timated in the mo&s;t accurate manner, by relieving the creditor from it, and laying it upon the jailor or me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, with re&s;pect to damages from breach of cove|nants, it appears that there is no defect in common law to make the interpo&s;ition of equity nece&s;&s;ary. And this ob&s;ervation, it is pre&s;u|med, will hold al&s;o with re&s;pect to deeds.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ART. II.</HI> Where the failure is partial only, not total.</HEAD>
<P>MANY obligations are of &s;uch a nature as to admit no medium be|tween complete performance and total failure. As to other obliga|tions, there may be a partial performance, and con&s;equently a failure that is but partial. A bargain and &s;ale of a hor&s;e, for a price certain, furni&s;heth an example of each kind. The vender's performance is indivi&s;ible: if he deliver not the hor&s;e, his failure is total. The obli|gation upon the purcha&s;er to pay the price, admits a performance by parts: if he have paid any part of the price, his performance is par|tial, and his failure partial.</P>
<P>Many obligations <HI>ad facta prae&s;tanda</HI> admit a medium between com|plete performance and total failure. A waggoner who engages to carry goods from London to Edinburgh, and &s;tops &s;hort at Newca&s;tle, has performed his bargain in part, and con&s;equently has failed but in part. The like, where a &s;hip freighted for a voyage is forced by &s;tre&s;s of weather to land her cargo before arriving at the de&s;tined port.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es of this kind the que&s;tion is, What &s;hall be the legal effect of a partial failure? With re&s;pect to common law the an&s;wer is ea&s;y: taking the bargain &s;trictly, I am not bound to pay the price or wa|ges till my party have performed his part of the bargain, that is, the
<PB N="162" REF="171">
whole of what he became bound to perform. But in order to an&s;wer the que&s;tion with re&s;pect to equity, a culpable failure mu&s;t be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from a failure occa&s;ioned by accident or misfortune. In the former ca&s;e a court of equity will give no relief; it being a general rule, That no claim is &s;u&s;tained in equity where the claim is occa&s;ion|ed by the fault of the claimant him&s;elf. But in the latter ca&s;e, a claim will be &s;u&s;tained for a part of the price or wages, in proportion to the performance, upon the principle <HI>Nemo debet locupletari aliena jac|tura.</HI> Thus, if a man undertake to build me a hou&s;e for a certain price, according to a plan concerted, and die before the hou&s;e be ful|ly completed, his repre&s;entatives will in equity be intitled to a part of the price, in proportion to the quantity of work done; for in pro|portion to that quantity I am <HI>locupletior aliena jactura.</HI> Thus, in the ca&s;e above mentioned, if the waggoner die at Newca&s;tle, or be pre|vented by other accident from completing his journey, he or his exe|cutors will have a claim again&s;t his employer <HI>pro rata itineris.</HI> And upon the &s;ame principle the freight is due <HI>pro rata itineris;</HI> which was found in the ca&s;e Lutwidge contra Gray <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abridged in the Dictionary under the title <HI>Periculum.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>A proce&s;s was lately brought before the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion upon the following fact. Mariners were hired at Gla&s;gow to perform a tra|ding voyage to Newfoundland, from thence to Li&s;bon, and from Li&s;|bon to Clyde; a certain &s;um <HI>per</HI> month for wages, to be paid when the voyage &s;hould be completed. The Gla&s;gow cargo was &s;afely landed in Newfoundland; and a cargo of fi&s;h, received there, was delivered at Li&s;bon. In the homeward pa&s;&s;age, the &s;hip, with the Li&s;bon cargo, was taken by a French privateer; and the mariners, when they obtained their liberty, demanded their wages <HI>pro rata iti|neris.</HI> This cau&s;e was compromi&s;ed; but from what is &s;aid, mari|ners &s;tand evidently upon the &s;ame footing with a waggoner, or an owner of a freighted &s;hip. And accordingly, it is a common &s;ay|ing, That the freight is the mother of the &s;eamens wages; meaning, that if the former be due, the latter mu&s;t al&s;o be due.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. Indirect means u&s;ed to evade performance.</HEAD>
<P>AMong per&s;ons who are &s;way'd by intere&s;t more than by con|&s;cience, the employing indirect means to evade the effect of their engagements, is far from being rare. Such conduct, as being incon|&s;i&s;tent with that candor and <HI>bona fides</HI> which is requi&s;ite in contracting, and in performing contracts, is morally wrong; and a court of equi|ty will be watchful to di&s;appoint every attempt of that nature. Thus, if a man, &s;ubjected to a thirlage of all the oats growing on his farm that he &s;hall have occa&s;ion to grind, &s;ell his own product of oats, and buy meal for the u&s;e of his family, with no other view but to di&s;ap|point the thirlage, this is a wrong <HI>contra bonam fidem contractus,</HI> which will &s;ubject him to the multure that would have been due for grind|ing the oats of his own farm. The following ca&s;e is an example of the &s;ame kind. A gentleman being abroad, and having no pro&s;pect of children, two of his neare&s;t relations agreed privately, that if the e&s;tate &s;hould be di&s;poned to either, the other was to have a certain &s;hare. The gentleman, ignorant of this agreement, &s;ettled his e&s;tate upon one of them, re&s;erving a power to alter. The di&s;ponee &s;ent his &s;on privately to Denmark, where the gentleman re&s;ided: upon which the former deed was recalled, and a new &s;ettlement made upon the &s;on. In a proce&s;s after the gentleman's death for performance of the agree|ment, the defence was, That the agreement did not take place, as the di&s;po&s;ition was not in favour of the defendant, but of his &s;on. The court found, That the defendant had acted fraudulently, in obtaining an alteration of the &s;ettlement in order to evade performance of the agreement; and that no man in con&s;cience can take benefit by his own fraud. For which rea&s;on he was decreed to fulfil the engage|ment as if the alteration had not been made <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, July 15. 1681, Campbell contra Moir.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ame foundation re&s;ts the following rule, That a court of equity will not &s;u&s;tain any objection which is calculated by the ob|jector to evade an obligation he is under to the per&s;on again&s;t whom the objection is made. This rule will be explained by the following examples. In a ranking, a creditor claimed preference upon the debt|or's e&s;cheat, becau&s;e it had fallen by a denunciation upon his horn|ing. An&s;wered, That there was no e&s;cheat, the debtor being relax|ed;
<PB N="164" REF="173">
and that though the relaxation was informal, yet the credi|tor had con&s;ented to it. The court would not permit the creditor to evade the effect of his con&s;ent, by in&s;i&s;ting upon the informality of the relaxation; and for that rea&s;on found him excluded <HI>per&s;onali ob|jectione</HI> from objecting to the relaxation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes, February 10. 1710, Wallace contra creditors of Spot.</NOTE>. In a competition between two annualrenters, the fir&s;t of whom was bound to the &s;econd as cau|tioner; the fir&s;t claiming preference, it was objected by the other, that it was unju&s;t in the cautioner to u&s;e his preferable infeft|ment for excluding a creditor who&s;e debt he was bound to pay. The court refu&s;ed to &s;u&s;tain this per&s;onal objection; leaving the &s;econd annualrenter to in&s;i&s;t per&s;onally again&s;t the fir&s;t as cautioner <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Forbes, June 28. 1711, Baird contra Mortimer.</NOTE>. This was acting as a court of common law, not as a court of equity: for it was undoubtedly a moral wrong in the fir&s;t annualrenter to lay hold of any means to evade or even to delay performance of his cautionary obligement; and the court ought to have repre&s;&s;ed this moral wrong, by &s;u&s;taining the per&s;onal objection again&s;t him. A cautioner for a curator being &s;ued for a &s;um levied by the curator, <HI>curatorio nomine,</HI> objected, That the curator had no right by rea&s;on of a prior act of cu|ratory &s;tanding unreduced.

A verbal pro|mi&s;e to di&s;pone land is not made effectual in equity; becau&s;e a court of equity cannot overturn common law, which gives a power of re|pentance unle&s;s writ be interpo&s;ed. But a purcha&s;er in&s;i&s;ting for per|formance of a di&s;po&s;ition of land granted to him, and the di&s;poner defending him&s;elf upon a nullity in the di&s;po&s;ition; the court found, That the defendant was barred <HI>per&s;onali objectione</HI> from objecting the nullity, becau&s;e he had verbally agreed to ratify the di&s;po&s;ition <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">February 22. 1745, Chri&s;ties contra Chri&s;tie.</NOTE>.</P>

could not move an objection which aro&s;e from his own fault.

<HEAD>SECT. VII. Repentance in what contracts permitted, and to whom.</HEAD>
<P>HAve we in Scotland any action &s;imilar to what in the Roman law is termed <HI>Condictio cau&s;a data cau&s;a non &s;ecuta?</HI> Voet, upon the title <HI>Condictio cau&s;a data,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ays, That the <HI>condictio ex paenitentia</HI> is not admitted in modern practice, becau&s;e every paction is now obli|gatory. It may indeed appear &s;ingular, that there &s;hould be a cove|nant of &s;uch a nature, as to afford to the one party an exception founded on <HI>paenitentia</HI> merely, or change of mind, and not to the o|ther. I incline however to be of opinion, that this privilege hath an equitable foundation with re&s;pect to every covenant that is &s;olely or chiefly beneficial to one of the contractors, and of little or no con&s;equence to the other. For example, I promi&s;e a man a &s;um of money to manumit his &s;lave. This man is not intere&s;ted to demand performance of the promi&s;e, becau&s;e he gains no more by the money than he lo&s;es by the manumi&s;&s;ion. Therefore, from the nature of the thing, the privilege of repentance ought to be indulged me. The common law however in this ca&s;e affords me no relief, be|cau&s;e it knows no di&s;tinction of parties: but it is the province of a court of equity to afford relief where the common law is deficient.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to covenants in which both parties are intere&s;ted, but the one much, the other little, it appears to me, that the party chief|ly intere&s;ted may be relieved in equity, if he can &s;how that perform|ance will be prejudicial to him. For example, I bargain with an un|dertaker to build me a dwelling-hou&s;e for a certain &s;um, according to a plan concerted. Before the work is begun, the plan is di&s;cover|ed to be faulty in many capital articles, and upon the whole to be ill contrived. Am I bound notwith&s;tanding to fulfil my covenant with the undertaker? This would be hard, and &s;carce agreeable to the be|nevolence of ju&s;tice. Suppo&s;e again, that, upon a more narrow in|&s;pection
<PB N="166" REF="175">
&s;pection into my affairs, the &s;um agreed on for building is found to be more than I can afford. Or what if, in the interim, I &s;ucceed to an e&s;tate, with a good hou&s;e upon it; or am invited by an employ|ment to &s;ettle el&s;ewhere? If I am relieved, the undertaker lo&s;es little, being at liberty to accept of employment from others: but if I be ri|gidly tied by my engagement, a great intere&s;t on my &s;ide is &s;acrificed to a &s;mall intere&s;t on his. Covenants, intended for the &s;upport of &s;o|ciety, and to connect individuals by mutual good offices, ought not to be &s;tretched to their ruin. The &s;ole difficulty is, to determine in what ca&s;es a court of equity &s;hould interpo&s;e. This is a delicate point; for it will not be thought that it ought to interpo&s;e in every covenant that is not &s;trictly equal. It is undoubtedly the &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e to refu&s;e the aid of the court, unle&s;s where the circum&s;tances are &s;o &s;trong as to afford a clear conviction of the hard&s;hip of per|formance.</P>
<P>Some covenants are of &s;uch a nature, and have &s;uch important con&s;equences, that to each party there is <HI>locus poenitentiae</HI> before per|formance. A contract of marriage is one of the&s;e; and for that rea&s;on, a bond granted by a woman to marry the obligee under the penalty of a certain &s;um, will not be effectual in equity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2.

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. How far a deed or covenant void at common law can be &s;upported in equity.</HEAD>
<P>A Principle in logics, That will without power cannot operate any effect, is applicable to law-matters; and is expre&s;&s;ed as fol|lows, That a deed <HI>ultra vires</HI> is null and void. The common law adheres rigidly to this principle, without di&s;tingui&s;hing whether the deed be totally beyond the power of the maker, or in part only: it is con&s;idered as one deed, which mu&s;t be entirely effectual or en|tirely void. The di&s;tinction is re&s;erved to a court of equity, which gives force to every rational deed as far as the maker's power ex|tends.</P>
<P>This doctrine &s;hall be illu&s;trated by proper examples. If one having power to grant a lea&s;e for ten years grants it for twenty, the lea&s;e is
<PB N="167" REF="176">
in equity good for ten years <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Chancery ca&s;es 23.</NOTE>. For here there can be no doubt about will; and ju&s;tice requires, that the lea&s;e &s;tand good as long as will is &s;upported by power. A tack &s;et by a par&s;on for more than three years without con&s;ent of the patron, is at common law void totally, but in equity is &s;u&s;tained for the three years <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, July 18. 1668, John&s;ton contra pari&s;hioners of Hoddam.</NOTE>. But a college having &s;et a perpetual lea&s;e of their teinds for 50 merks yearly, which teinds were yearly worth 200 merks, and the lea&s;e being challenged for want of power in the makers, who could not give &s;uch a lea&s;e without an ade|quate con&s;ideration, it was found totally null, and not &s;u&s;tained for any limited time or higher duty <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, July 13. 1669, Old college of Aberdeen contra the Town.</NOTE>. For a court of equity, as well as a court of common law, mu&s;t act by general rules; and here there was no rule for a&s;certaining either the endurance of the lea&s;e or the extent of the duty. Further, a court of equity may &s;eparate a deed into its con&s;tituent parts, and &s;upport the maker's will as far as he had power: but here the limiting the endurance and augmenting the duty &s;o as to corre&s;pond to the power of the makers, would be to frame a new lea&s;e, varying in every article from the will of the makers of the lea&s;e challenged.</P>
<P>The &s;ettlement of an e&s;tate by marriage-articles upon the heir of the marriage, is not intended to bar the hu&s;band from a &s;econd mar|riage; nor con&s;equently to bar him from making rational provi&s;ions to the i&s;&s;ue of that marriage. Let us &s;uppo&s;e that a man thus bound to the heir of his fir&s;t marriage, makes exorbitant provi&s;ions to his chil|dren of the &s;econd marriage, &s;uch as his whole e&s;tate, or the greater part. This &s;ettlement is voidable at common law, as a breach of engagement; and it is a matter of delicacy for a court of equity to interpo&s;e where they have no general rule for direction. Ju&s;tice however demands an interpo&s;ition, that children, to whom the father certainly intended to give all in his power, may not be left entirely de&s;titute: nor would it be con&s;i&s;tent with common &s;en&s;e, that chil|dren &s;hould &s;uffer as much by exce&s;s of affection in their father as by his utter neglect. In this ca&s;e, therefore, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion in|terpo&s;es, by re&s;tricting the provi&s;ions within rational bounds, &s;uch as are con&s;i&s;tent with the engagement the father came under in his fir&s;t contract of marriage. The court however never interpo&s;es without nece&s;&s;ity; and therefore if the common law afford any means for providing the children, the&s;e means are preferred. This
<PB N="168" REF="177">
ob&s;ervation will be put in a clear light by the following ca&s;e. Colo|nel Campbell, by marriage-articles, being bound to provide to the i&s;&s;ue thereof the &s;um of 40,000 merks, with the conque&s;t, did, by a deathbed-&s;ettlement, appoint his elde&s;t &s;on to be heir and executor; and left it upon the Duke of Argyle and Earl of Ilay to name ra|tional provi&s;ions to his younger children. The referees having de|clined the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, the younger children in&s;i&s;ted to have the &s;ettlement voided, as contradictory to the marriage-articles. It was pleaded for the heir, That the Colonel had a power to divide the &s;pecial &s;um and conque&s;t, by giving more to one child and le&s;s to another; and though the whole happens to be &s;ettled on the elde&s;t &s;on by accident, not by intention, yet that this inequality, &s;uppo&s;ing it to have been intended, is no foundation for voiding the &s;ettlement totally, but only to bring in the younger children for a moderate &s;hare. The court voided the &s;ettlement totally; which intitled the children each of them to an equal &s;hare of the &s;ubjects provided to them in the marriage-contract <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">December 22. 1739, Campbell contra Campbells.</NOTE>. The court mu&s;t inter|po&s;e where the rigor of the common law deprives the younger chil|dren of all: but in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e the &s;ettlement was void at com|mon law; and the younger children being &s;ufficiently provided by the contract of marriage, there was no nece&s;&s;ity for an equitable interpo|&s;ition.</P>
<P>It being the profe&s;&s;ed intention of parties entering into a &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, to put an end to all the differences that are &s;ubmitted, arbiters are cho&s;en to fulfil that intention, who are bound by acceptance to execute the commi&s;&s;ion given them. Hence an award or decreet-ar|bitral is void at common law, if any article &s;ubmitted be left unde|cided, becau&s;e in that ca&s;e the commi&s;&s;ion is not executed. This is equitable as well as legal where the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion contains mutual claims, it being gro&s;sly partial to a&s;certain the claims of one of the parties, while the other is left to an action. But where the claims are all on one &s;ide, and &s;ome of them only determined, equity will &s;upport the award, which, as far as it goes, is beneficial to the par|ties; for it is always better to have &s;ome of their di&s;putes determined than none of them. This however goes upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that no objection in equity lies again&s;t the award: for if a deed be null at common law, a court of equity will never &s;upport it, except as far as it is ju&s;t.</P>
<P>When arbiters take upon them to determine articles that are not &s;ubmitted, the award or decreet-arbitral is at common law void,
<PB N="169" REF="178">
even with re&s;pect to the articles &s;ubmitted; becau&s;e it is con&s;ider|ed as one entire act, which mu&s;t be wholly effectual or wholly void. Equity goes more accurately to work: it &s;eparates the articles &s;ubmitted from tho&s;e not &s;ubmitted, and &s;u&s;tains the award as far as the arbiters were ve&s;ted with proper powers. Thus, if two &s;ub|mit all actions &s;ub&s;i&s;ting at the date of the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and the arbitrators award a relea&s;e of all actions to the time of the award, the award &s;hall be good for what is in the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and void for the re&s;idue only <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New abridg. of the law, vol. 1. p. 139, 140.</NOTE>.

But in many ca&s;es third parties happen to be affected, of which take the following example. A younger brother &s;erves heir to his father, and is infeft, the elde&s;t having been &s;o long abroad as to be reputed dead. He comes home, and claims the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; which <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> voids the &s;ervice and infeftment of his brother; becau&s;e a &s;ervice can have no legal effect without a right to be &s;erved. In the interim the younger brother has acted <HI>bona fide</HI> as proprietor: and many have been his tran&s;actions with third parties, who were al&s;o <HI>in bona fide;</HI> which tran&s;actions, being founded upon his title of property, are null and void, as flowing <HI>a non habente pote&s;tatem.</HI> Is there no relief in equity in a ca&s;e of this nature, where the hard&s;hip on third par|ties is intolerable? One thing is clear, that the <HI>bona fides</HI> of the young|er brother will &s;ecure him again&s;t a claim for the rents con&s;umed. On the other hand, it is equally clear, that no &s;ale made by him can be effectual, unle&s;s as far as nece&s;&s;ary for payment of the family-debts; to which extent a &s;ale may be &s;upported in equity. The only general rule is, That equity will &s;upport every act of ordinary ad|mini&s;tration; but that acts of extraordinary admini&s;tration will not be effectual, except &s;uch as being prudent and rational are beneficial to the righteous heir. Upon that rule the court proceeded in the fa|mous ca&s;e of Mi&s;&s;ini&s;h, who being the only heir in being at the time, was admitted to &s;erve, though there was a nearer heir in po&s;&s;ibility, who afterward exi&s;ted. Mi&s;&s;ini&s;h, by his &s;ervice and infeftment, was only a conditional proprietor, his right depending on the exi&s;t|ence or non-exi&s;tence of a nearer heir; and as a nearer heir came in|to exi&s;tence, Mi&s;&s;ini&s;h's right was null <HI>a principio.</HI> But he having &s;old land for payment of the family-debts while there was yet no pro&s;pect of a nearer heir, the &s;ale was &s;upported by the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion, upon evidence brought that it was <HI>in rem ver&s;um</HI> of the true heir.</P>
<P>Similar is the ca&s;e of Count Antonius Le&s;lie, an alien, who was
<PB N="171" REF="180">
&s;erved and infeft in the e&s;tate of Balquhain, as next heir of entail; for an alien at that time was thought capable to inherit land in Scot|land. But his title being afterward challenged upon that ground by Peter Le&s;lie-Grant, the next &s;ub&s;titute, the rea&s;on of reduction was &s;u&s;tained in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, and in the hou&s;e of Lords. During his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion he had &s;old many trees come to maturity, the price of which he had received. And he was protected from accounting for articles of this &s;ort that happened while he was <HI>in bona fide.</HI></P>
<P>The famous ca&s;e of Barbarius Philippus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 3. De o&s;&s;icio praet.</NOTE> is an in&s;tance of the &s;ame kind. Being elected a Roman Praetor, he determined many cau&s;es, and tran&s;acted every &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s that belonged to the of|fice. At the long run he was di&s;covered to be a &s;lave, which ren|dered all his acts and deeds void at common law; becau&s;e none but a freeman was capable to be elected a Roman Praetor. With re&s;pect to third parties, however, his acts and deeds were held to be good, as if he really had been a Praetor.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IX. Whether any &s;upervening accident can in equity void or render ineffectual a contract originally unexceptionable.</HEAD>
<P>IN January 1755, Fo&s;ter and Duncan &s;et to Adam&s;on and William|&s;on a &s;almon-fi&s;hing in the river Tay oppo&s;ite to Errol, on the north &s;ide of a &s;hallow named the <HI>Guinea-bank,</HI> to endure for five years. The river there is broad; but the current, being narrow, pa&s;&s;ed at that time along the north &s;ide of the &s;aid bank, the re&s;t of the river being dead water. As one cannot fi&s;h with profit but in the current, the tack&s;men made large profits the fir&s;t two years, and were not lo|&s;ers the third; but the fourth year the current changed, which fre|quently happens in that river, and in&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing as formerly a|long the north &s;ide of the bank, pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;outh &s;ide, which was a part of the river &s;et to other tack&s;men; by which means the fi&s;hing &s;et to Adam&s;on and William&s;on became entirely unprofitable the remainder of their lea&s;e.</P>
<P>The granters of the tack having brought a proce&s;s again&s;t the tack&s;|men for L. 36 Sterling, being the tack-duty for the two la&s;t years, the defence was a total &s;terility by the change of the current as afore&s;aid;
<PB N="172" REF="181">
and a proof being taken, the facts appeared to be what are above mentioned.</P>
<P>It was admitted for the pur&s;uers, that the extinction of the &s;ubject mu&s;t have the effect even at common law to put an end to the lea&s;e; becau&s;e the lea&s;e having a &s;pecial relation to a &s;ubject which is to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for rent, it cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t when there remains no &s;ubject that can be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; as for example, when land is &s;wallowed up by the &s;ea, or when a river totally changes its cour&s;e, and never returns to its former channel. The ca&s;e is different in &s;terility, whether of land or of fi&s;hing; for there the &s;ubject remaining in exi&s;tence, is &s;till ca|pable to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the le&s;&s;ee; and con&s;equently the lea&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and the rent is due, however unprofitable the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion may be. If therefore there be any relief in the ca&s;e of &s;terility, it mu&s;t be upon equitable con&s;iderations; and whatever may be thought with re&s;pect to a total &s;terility during the whole years of the lea&s;e, or during the remaining years after the lea&s;e is offered to be given up, the &s;terility here was temporary only: for as the &s;tream of the river Tay is ex|tremely changeable, it might have returned to its former place in a month or in a week; and as the tack&s;men adhered to the tack, and did not offer to &s;urrender the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they certainly were in daily expectation that the current would take its former cour&s;e. That &s;uch a temporary &s;terility cannot afford a defence in equity again&s;t payment of the rent, will appear from the following con&s;iderations. <HI>Primo,</HI> A lea&s;e puts the le&s;&s;ee in place of the landlord as to profit and lo&s;s; the profit is his without limitation, and &s;o ought the lo&s;s: <HI>Cujus commodum ejus debet e&s;&s;e incommodum</HI> is a rule in equity that holds with the greate&s;t force in a lea&s;e where the le&s;&s;ee draws all the profit, if it &s;hould be ten times his rent, and on the other hand can never lo&s;e more than his rent. <HI>Secundo,</HI> There can be no equity in the defence after the lea&s;e is at an end. For at that rate the tenant has a fine game to play: if the &s;terility continue to the end of the lea&s;e, the tenant takes advantage of the equitable defence to get free of the rent; but if fruit|fulne&s;s be re&s;tored, he takes advantage of the lea&s;e, and makes all the profit he can. The landlord by this means continues bound while the tenant is free, which is repugnant to all the rules of equity as well as of common law. <HI>Tertio,</HI> At any rate the tenant cannot pick out one or other &s;terile year to get free of that year's rent: if equity afford him any deduction, it mu&s;t be upon a calculation of the whole years of the lea&s;e; for if he be a gainer upon the whole, which is the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, he has no claim in equity for any deduction. It was carried, however, by a plurality to &s;u&s;tain the defence of &s;terility,
<PB N="173" REF="182" MS="y">
and to a&s;&s;oilzie the defenders from the rent due for the la&s;t two years of the tack.</P>
<P>This judgement &s;eems not better founded in equity than at common law; and it is ea&s;y to di&s;cover what moved the plurality. In a que|&s;tion between a rich landlord and a poor tenant, the natural bias is in favour of the latter: the &s;ubject in controver&s;y may be a trifle to the landlord, and yet be the tenant's all, A ca&s;e may be put oppo&s;ite to that under con&s;ideration. A widow woman with a numerous fa|mily of children has nothing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on but her liferent of a dwel|ling-hou&s;e, and of an exten&s;ive orchard. The&s;e &s;he lea&s;es to a man in opulent circum&s;tances, for a rent of L. 15 for the hou&s;e, and L. 25 for the orchard. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es for &s;everal years with rea&s;onable profit. The orchard happens to be barren the two la&s;t years of the lea&s;e, and he claims a deduction upon that account. No man would give this ca&s;e again&s;t the widow. So much do extraneous circum|&s;tances influence the determinations of a court, even where the judges are not &s;en&s;ible of them.</P>
<P>I am not certain but that &s;ome of the judges con&s;idered this as a <HI>rei interitus</HI> to afford a defence at common law; a very great mi&s;take, as a thing cannot be under&s;tood to be totally de&s;troy'd while we have daily expectation of its being re&s;tored to its former condition <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fo&s;ter and Duncan contra Adam&s;on and William&s;on, July 16. 1762.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. X. Where a deed or covenant is occa&s;ioned by error.</HEAD>
<P>ERror may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into two kinds. One prevents con&s;ent altogether; as for example, where the purcha&s;er has one &s;ub|ject in view and the vender another. In this ca&s;e there is no bar|gain; for the parties agree not in the &s;ame thing. This can only happen in covenants; and as no obligation can ari&s;e where there is no agreement, &s;uch a covenant, if it can be called &s;o, is void by the common law; and there is no occa&s;ion for the interpo&s;ition of equi|ty. The other kind is where the error is not &s;uch as to prevent con|&s;ent, but is a motive only for entering into an engagement. An er|ror of this kind may happen in &s;ingle deeds as well as in covenants; and as here will or con&s;ent is really interpo&s;ed, the deed mu&s;t be ef|fectual at common law; and the que&s;tion is, Whether, or how far, there ought to be a relief in equity on account of the error?</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="183">
A maxim above laid down<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 98.</NOTE> will pave the way to the &s;olution of this que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> That one <HI>certans de damno evitando</HI> may lawfully take advantage of an error committed by another; but that ju&s;tice forbids &s;uch advantage to be taken in order to make po&s;itive gain by it. From the inve&s;tigation of this maxim in the place cited, it will appear that ju&s;tice makes no di&s;tinction between an error in fact and an error in law. One difference indeed there is, which belongs not to the pre&s;ent head, that an error in law is not &s;o readily pre&s;umed as an error in fact.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with &s;howing what influence an error has with rela|tion to grants and other &s;ingle deeds. Some are purely gratuitous, &s;ome are founded on an antecedent rational cau&s;e. Such cau&s;e mu&s;t in all events &s;upport the deed, becau&s;e ju&s;tice will not permit the ma|ker to &s;eek re&s;titution again&s;t a deed which it was rational to grant. And &s;uppo&s;ing him to be bound in con&s;cience only, a court of equity will not void an hone&s;t deed, though occa&s;ioned by an erroneous mo|tive. A rich man, for example, executes a bond in favour of an in|digent relation, moved by an erroneous belief that this relation had behaved gallantly in a battle where he was not even pre&s;ent. Equity will not relieve the granter again&s;t this deed, being in it&s;elf rational, and which at any rate is a matter of charity. The creditor, it is true, gains by the error: but then it cannot be &s;aid that he lays hold of this error to hurt the granter of the bond, becau&s;e a man cannot be &s;aid to be hurt by doing an act of genero&s;ity or charity.</P>
<P>Equity therefore relieves not from error, except with relation to deeds purely gratuitous, &s;uch as donations, legacies, &amp;c.; nor with relation to the&s;e, unle&s;s where the &s;ole motive of granting is erroneous. An error the di&s;covery of which would not have totally prevented the deed, cannot at all be regarded; for a gratuitous deed mu&s;t be &s;u&s;|tained in whole or voided in whole, there not being here as in cove|nants any mea&s;ure of equality or inequality. With re&s;pect then to a gratuitous deed where the &s;ole motive of granting is erroneous, ju|&s;tice requires that the granter be relieved from performance. He feels him&s;elf not bound in con&s;cience; and the grantee's con&s;cience dictates to him, that he ought not to make profit by &s;uch error. To this purpo&s;e Papinian. <Q REND="inline">"Fal&s;am cau&s;am legato non obe&s;&s;e, verius e&s;t: quia ratio legandi legato non cohaeret.

<P>With re&s;pect to the legacies contained in the latter te&s;tament, again&s;t which no relief was granted, the opinion delivered appears well founded.

<P><PB N="176" REF="185">
With re&s;pect to contracts where means are erroneou&s;ly cho&s;en that an&s;wer not the intention of the contractors, an error of this magni|tude will void the contract: as to which, &s;ee &s;ect. 4. art. 1.

The mo&s;t that can be made of an error in &s;uch a ca&s;e, is to found a claim in e|quity for abating the price in order to make the bargain &s;trictly e|qual; and this was done by the Roman law, which annulls every &s;ale where the le&s;ion or prejudice is <HI>ultra duplum</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 2.

<P>This affords a good opportunity to illu&s;trate the legal effects of a tran&s;action. A tran&s;action putting an end to any matter in contro|ver&s;y or di&s;pute, mu&s;t be effectual; for a deed will never be pre&s;umed to proceed from error, where there is a ju&s;t or rational motive for making it. On the other hand, if a man be moved to make a tran&s;|action upon &s;uppo&s;ition of a claim which has no foundation, an er|ror of this kind will undoubtedly entitle him to be relieved in equity. <Q REND="inline">"Si ex fal&s;is in&s;trumentis tran&s;actiones vel pactiones initae fuerint, quamvis jusjurandum de his interpo&s;itum &s;it, etiam civiliter fal&s;o revelato, eas retractari praecipimus; ita demum, ut &s;i de pluribus cau&s;is vel capitulis eaedem pactiones &s;eu tran&s;actiones initae fuerint, illa tantummodo cau&s;a vel pars retractetur, quae ex fal&s;o in&s;trumen|to compo&s;ito convicta fuerit, aliis capitulis firmis manentibus <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 42.

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Powers of a court of equity to remedy what is imperfect in common law with re&s;pect to &s;tatutes.</HEAD>
<P>COn&s;idering the limited nature of a court of common law, there is no rea&s;on that it &s;hould have more power over &s;tatutes than over private deeds. With re&s;pect to both it is confined to the words, and mu&s;t not pretend to pronounce any judgement upon the &s;pirit and meaning in oppo&s;ition to the words. And yet the words of a &s;tatute corre&s;pond not always to the will of the legi&s;lature; nor are the things enacted proper means always to an&s;wer the end in view; fall|ing &s;ometimes &s;hort of the end, and &s;ometimes going beyond it. Hence in making &s;tatutes effectual, there is the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity for the interpo&s;ition of a court of equity to &s;upply defects and correct exce&s;&s;es, that there is in making deeds and covenants effectual. But in order to form a ju&s;t notion of the powers of a court of equity with re&s;pect to &s;tatutes, it is nece&s;&s;ary, as a preliminary point, to a&s;certain how far they come under the powers of a court of common law; and with that point I &s;hall commence the inquiry.</P>
<P>Submi&s;&s;ion to a regular government is univer&s;ally acknowledged to be a duty: but the true foundation of this duty &s;eems to lie in ob&s;cu|rity, though &s;carce any other topic has filled more volumes. Many writers derive this duty from an original compact between the &s;ove|reign and his people. Be it &s;o. But then, what binds tho&s;e who follow in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion? for a compact binds tho&s;e only who are parties to it; not to mention that governments were e&s;tabli&s;hed long before contracts were of any con&s;iderable authority <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;torical law-tracts, tract 2.</NOTE>. Others, di&s;&s;atisfied with this narrow foundation, endeavour to a&s;&s;ign one more exten&s;ive, deriving the foregoing duty from what is termed in the Roman law a <HI>qua&s;i-contract.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"It is a rule," they &s;ay, "in law, and in common &s;en&s;e, That a man who lays hold of a benefit, mu&s;t take it with its conditions, and &s;ubmit to its nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences. Thus one who accepts a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t pay the ance&s;tor's debts: he is pre|&s;umed to agree to this condition, and is not le&s;s firmly bound than by an explicit engagement. In point of government, protection and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion are reciprocal; and the taking protection from a law|ful
<PB N="178" REF="187">
government, infers a con&s;ent to &s;ubmit to its laws."</Q> This ground of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is not much more exten&s;ive than the former; for both proceed upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that without con&s;ent expre&s;s'd or imply'd no per&s;on owes obedience to government. At this rate, the greater part of tho&s;e who live under government are left in a &s;tate of independency; for &s;eldom is there occa&s;ion to afford &s;uch peculiar protection to private per&s;ons, as nece&s;&s;arily to infer their con&s;ent. In fact, the far greater part of tho&s;e who live in &s;ociety, are not capable to under&s;tand the foregoing rea&s;oning: many of them have not even the &s;lighte&s;t notion of what is meant by the terms <HI>protection</HI> and <HI>&s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion.</HI> I am inclined therefore to think, that this important duty has a more &s;olid foundation; and, comparing it with other moral du|ties, I find no rea&s;on to doubt, that, like them, it is deeply rooted in human nature <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See E&s;&s;ays on the principles of morality and natural religion, part 1. e&s;&s;. 2. chap. 7.</NOTE>. If a man be a &s;ocial being, and government e&s;&s;en|tial to &s;ociety, it is not conformable to the analogy of nature, that we &s;hould be left to an argument for inve&s;tigating the duty we owe our rulers. If ju&s;tice, veracity, gratitude, and other private duties, be &s;upported and inforc'd by the moral &s;en&s;e, it would be &s;trange that nature &s;hould be deficient with re&s;pect to the public duty only. But nature is not deficient in any branch of the human con&s;titution: go|vernment is not le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ociety, than &s;ociety to man; and by the very frame of our nature we are fitted for government as well as for &s;ociety. To form originally a &s;tate or &s;ociety under government, there can be no means, it is true, other than compact; but this foun|dation is far from being &s;ufficient to &s;upport a &s;tate after it is formed, and to pre&s;erve it for any cour&s;e of time. The continuance of a &s;tate, and of government over multitudes who never have occa&s;ion to pro|mi&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t depend on a different principle. The moral &s;en&s;e, which binds individuals to be ju&s;t to each other, binds them equally to &s;ubmit to the laws of their &s;ociety; and we have a clear conviction that this is our duty. The &s;trength of this conviction is no where more vi&s;ible than in a di&s;ciplined army. There the duty of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is exerted every moment at the hazard of life; and fre|quently where the hazard is imminent, and death almo&s;t certain. In a word, what rea&s;on &s;hows to be nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ociety, is, by the moral &s;en&s;e, made an indi&s;pen&s;able duty. We have a &s;en&s;e of fitne&s;s and rectitude in &s;ubmitting to the laws of our &s;ociety; and we have a &s;en&s;e
<PB N="179" REF="188">
of wrong, of guilt, and of meriting puni&s;hment, when we tran&s;gre&s;s them <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In examining this matter, it would not be fair to take under con&s;ideration &s;tatutes re|lating to ju&s;tice, becau&s;e ju&s;tice is binding independent of municipal law. Con&s;ider only things left indifferent by the law of nature, and which are regulated by &s;tatute for the good of &s;ociety; the laws, for example, again&s;t u&s;ury, again&s;t exporting corn in time of dearth, and many that will occur upon the fir&s;t reflection. Every man of virtue will find him&s;elf bound in con&s;cience to &s;ubmit to &s;uch laws. Nay, even with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who by intere&s;t are moved to tran&s;gre&s;s them, I venture to affirm, that the fir&s;t acts, at lea&s;t, of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, are &s;eldom perpetrated with a quiet mind. I will not even except what is called <HI>&s;muggling;</HI> though private intere&s;t authori&s;ed by example, and the trifle that is lo&s;t to the public by any &s;ingle tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, ob&s;cure generally the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of wrong; and perhaps, after repeat|ed acts, which harden individuals in iniquity, make it vani&s;h altogether. It mu&s;t however be acknowledged, that the moral &s;en&s;e, uniform as to the laws of nature, operates with very different degrees of force with relation to municipal law. The laws of a free government, directed for the good of the &s;ociety, and peculiarly tender of the liberty of the &s;ubject, have great and univer&s;al influence. They are obey'd chearfully as a matter of &s;trict duty. The laws of a de&s;potic government, on the contrary, calculated chiefly to advance the power or &s;ecure the per&s;on of a tyrant, require military force to make them effectual; for con&s;cience &s;carce interpo&s;eth in their behalf. And hence the great &s;uperiority of a free &s;tate, with re|&s;pect to the power of the governors as well as the happine&s;s of the &s;ubjects, over every king|dom that in any degree is de&s;potic or tyrannical.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hence it clearly follows, that every voluntary tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of what is by &s;tatute ordered to be done or prohibited, is a moral wrong, and a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law of nature. This doctrine will be found of great importance in the pre&s;ent inquiry.</P>
<P>Many differences among &s;tatutes mu&s;t be kept in view, in order to a&s;certain the powers of a court of common law concerning them. Some &s;tatutes are compul&s;ory, others prohibitory; &s;ome re&s;pect indi|viduals, others the public only; of &s;ome the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion occa&s;ions damage, of others not; to &s;ome a penalty is annexed, others re&s;t up|on authority merely.</P>
<P>I begin with tho&s;e which re&s;t upon authority merely, without an|nexing any penalty to the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. The neglect of a compul&s;o|ry &s;tatute of this kind will found an action at common law to tho&s;e who have intere&s;t, ordaining the defendant either to do what the &s;ta|tute requires, or to pay damages. If, again, the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a prohibitory &s;tatute of the &s;ame kind harm any per&s;on, the duty of the court is obvious: The harm mu&s;t be repaired, by voiding the act where it can be voided, &s;uch as an alienation after inhibition; and where the harm is incapable of this remedy, damages mu&s;t be award|ed. This is fulfilling the will of the legi&s;lature, being all that is in|tended by &s;uch &s;tatutes.</P>
<P>But from di&s;obeying a &s;tatute prejudice often en&s;ues, which, not being pecuniary, cannot be repaired by awarding a &s;um in name of
<PB N="180" REF="189">
damages. Statutes relating to the public are generally of this nature; and many al&s;o in which individuals are immediately concerned <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This branch, by the general di&s;tribution, ought regularly to be handled afterward, part 2. of this fir&s;t book; but by joining it here to other matters with which it is intimately connected, I thought it would appear in a clearer light.</NOTE>. To clear this point we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h as formerly between compul|&s;ory and prohibitory &s;tatutes. The tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a prohibitory &s;ta|tute is a direct contempt of legal authority, and con&s;equently a mo|ral wrong, which ought to be redre&s;&s;ed; and it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the purpo&s;e of the legi&s;lature to leave the remedy to a court of law, where the prohibition is not enforced by a particular &s;anction. This is a clear inference, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e the legi&s;lature guilty of an ab|&s;urdity, <HI>viz.</HI> prohibiting a thing to be done, and yet leaving indivi|duals at liberty to di&s;obey with impunity. To make the will of the legi&s;lature effectual in this ca&s;e, different means mu&s;t be employ'd ac|cording to the nature of the &s;ubject. If an act done <HI>prohibente lege</HI> can be undone, the mo&s;t effectual method of redre&s;&s;ing the wrong is to void the act. If the act cannot be undone, the only means left is puni&s;hment. And accordingly it is a rule in the law of England <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2. In&s;tit. 163.</NOTE>, that an offender for contempt of the law, may be fined and impri|&s;oned at the King's &s;uit <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">If this doctrine to any one appear &s;ingular, let it be con&s;idered, that the power infilled on is only that of authori&s;ing a proper puni&s;hment for a crime after it is committed, which is no novelty in law. Every crime committed again&s;t the law of nature, may be puni&s;hed at the di&s;cretion of the judge, where the legi&s;lature has not appointed a particular puni&s;hment; and it is made evident above, that a contempt of legal authority is a crime again&s;t the law of nature. But to &s;upport this in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, an argument from analogy is very little ne|ce&s;&s;ary; for, as ob&s;erved above, it is obviou&s;ly derived from the will of the legi&s;lature. I &s;hall only add, that the power of naming a puni&s;hment for a crime after it is committed, is greatly inferior to that of making a table of puni&s;hments for crimes that may be committed hereafter, which is a capital branch of the legi&s;lative authority.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a compul&s;ory &s;tatute order|ing a thing to be done, infers not nece&s;&s;arily a contempt of legal au|thority. It may be an act of omi&s;&s;ion only, which is not criminal; and it will always be con&s;tructed to be &s;uch, unle&s;s, from collateral circum&s;tances, it be made evident that there was a po&s;itive intention to contemn the law. Suppo&s;ing then the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion to be an act of omi&s;&s;ion only, and con&s;equently no place for puni&s;hment, the que&s;tion is, What can be done, in order to fulfil the will of the legi&s;|lature? The court has two methods: one is, to order the &s;tatute to be fulfilled; and if this order be al&s;o di&s;obey'd, a criminal contempt mu&s;t be the con&s;truction of the per&s;on's behaviour, to be followed, as in the former ca&s;e, with a proper puni&s;hment. The other is, to
<PB N="181" REF="190">
order the thing to be done under a penalty. I give an example. The freeholders are by &s;tatute bound to convene at Michaelmas, in order to receive upon the roll per&s;ons qualified; but no penalty is added to compel obedience. In <HI>odium</HI> of a freeholder who de&s;ires to be put upon the roll, they forbear to meet. What is the remedy here where there is no pecuniary damage? The court of &s;e&s;&s;ion may appoint them to meet under a penalty. For, in general, if it be the duty of judges to order the end, they mu&s;t u&s;e &s;uch means as are in their power. And if this can be done with re&s;pect to a private per&s;on, it follows, that where a thing is ordered to be done for the good of the public, it belongs to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, upon application of the King's Advocate, to order the thing to be done under a penalty. In a proce&s;s at the in&s;tance of an heritor intitled to a &s;almon-fi&s;hing in a river, again&s;t an inferior heritor, for regulating his cruive and cruive-dike, concluding, That he &s;hould ob&s;erve the Saturday's &s;lap; that the hecks of his cruives &s;hould be three inches wide, &amp;c. it was decreed, That the defendant &s;hould be obliged to ob&s;erve the&s;e regu|lations under the penalty of L. 50 Sterling. It was urged for the de|fendant, That the pur&s;uer mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with damages upon con|travention; becau&s;e the law has impo&s;ed no penalty, and the court can impo&s;e none. An&s;wered, That it is beyond the reach of art to a&s;certain the damage in this ca&s;e; and therefore that to inforce the&s;e regulations a penalty is nece&s;&s;ary. For if this remedy be neglected by the legi&s;lature, it mu&s;t &s;upplied by a court of equity upon the principle, That if there be a right it ought to be made effectual.</P>
<P>What next come under con&s;ideration are &s;tatutes forbidding things to be done under a penalty; for to the omi&s;&s;ion of a thing ordered to be done, a penalty is &s;eldom annexed. The&s;e are di&s;tingui&s;hable into two kinds. The fir&s;t regard the more noxious evils, which the le|gi&s;lature prohibits ab&s;olutely; leaving the courts of law to employ all the means in their power for repre&s;&s;ing them; but adding a pe|nalty beforehand, becau&s;e that check is not in the power of courts of law. The &s;econd regard &s;lighter evils, to repre&s;s which no other means are intended to be applied but a pecuniary penalty only. Both kinds are equally binding in con&s;cience; for in every ca&s;e it is a moral wrong to di&s;obey the law. But then di&s;obedience to a &s;tatute of the &s;econd cla&s;s is attended with no other con&s;equence but payment of the penalty; whereas the penalty in the fir&s;t cla&s;s is due, as we &s;ay, <HI>by and attour performance;</HI> and for that rea&s;on, a court of law, be&s;ide inflicting the penalty, is bound to u&s;e all the means in its power to make the will of the legi&s;lature effectual, in the &s;ame manner as if
<PB N="182" REF="191">
there were no penalty. And even &s;uppo&s;ing that the act prohibited is capable of being voided by the &s;entence of a court, the penalty ought &s;till to be inflicted; for otherwi&s;e it will lo&s;e its influence as a prohibitory means.</P>
<P>Prohibitory &s;tatutes are often &s;o inaccurately expre&s;&s;ed, as to leave it doubtful whether the penalty be intended the only means of re|pre&s;&s;ing the evil, or one of the means only. This defect occa&s;ions in courts of law much conjectural rea&s;oning, and many arbitrary judge|ments. The capital circum&s;tance for a&s;certaining the difference, ap|pears to be the nature of the evil prohibited. With re&s;pect to every evil of a pernicious nature, and of a general bad tendency, it ought to be held the will of the legi&s;lature to give no quarter: and con&s;e|quently, be&s;ide inflicting the penalty, it is the duty of courts of law to u&s;e every other mean to make this will effectual. With re&s;pect a|gain to evils of a le&s;s pernicious or le&s;s exten&s;ive nature, it ought to be held the intention of the legi&s;lature, to leave no power with judges beyond inflicting the penalty. This doctrine will be illu&s;trated by the following examples. By the act 52. parl. 1587. <Q REND="inline">"He who bargains for greater profit than 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> &s;hall be puni&s;hed as an u&s;urer."</Q> Here is a penalty without declaring &s;uch bargains null: and yet it has ever been held the intendment of this act to di&s;charge u&s;ury total|ly; and the penalty is deemed to be added as one mean only of ma|king the prohibition effectual. There was accordingly never any difficulty of &s;u&s;taining action for voiding u&s;urious bargains, nor e|ven of making the lender liable for the &s;ums received by him above the legal intere&s;t. This then is held to be a &s;tatute of the fir&s;t cla&s;s. The following &s;tatutes belong to the &s;econd cla&s;s. An exclu&s;ive pri|vilege of printing books is given to the authors and their a&s;&s;igns for the term of fourteen years. Any per&s;on who within the time limited prints or imports any &s;uch book, &s;hall forfeit the &s;ame to the proprie|tor, and one penny for every &s;heet found in his cu&s;tody; the half to the King, and the other half to whoever &s;hall &s;ue for the &s;ame <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">8. Ann. 18.</NOTE>. With re&s;pect to the monopoly granted by this &s;tatute, it has been ju&s;t|ly e&s;tabli&s;hed, that a court of law is confined to the penalty, and cannot apply other means for making it effectual, not even an action of damages again&s;t an interloper <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">June 7. 1748, Book&s;ellers of London contra Book&s;ellers of Edinburgh and Gla&s;gow.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline">"Members of the college of ju&s;tice are di&s;charged to buy any lands, teinds, &amp;c. the property of which is controverted in a proce&s;s, under the certification of lo|&s;ing their office <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act 216. parl. 1594.</NOTE>."</Q> The evil here being neither &s;o pernicious nor
<PB N="183" REF="192">
&s;o exten&s;ive as u&s;ury, it has been always held the &s;en&s;e of the &s;tatute, to be &s;atisfied with the penalty, without giving authority to reduce or void &s;uch bargains.</P>
<P>But though contracts or deeds contrary to &s;tatutory prohibitions of the kind la&s;t mentioned, are not &s;ubject to reduction, it is a very different point, Whether it be the duty of courts of law to force per|formance of &s;uch a contract or deed by &s;u&s;taining action upon it. And yet this di&s;tinction &s;eems to have been overlooked in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion: for it is the practice of that court, while they inflict the penalty, to &s;upport with their authority that very thing which is pro|hibited under the penalty. Thus a member of the college of ju&s;tice buying land while the property is controverted in a proce&s;s, is de|prived of his office; and yet, with the &s;ame breath, action is given him to make the minute of &s;ale effectual <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haddington, June 5. 1611, Cunninghame contra Maxwell. Durie, July 30. 1635, Richard&s;on contra Sinclair. Fountainhall, December 20. 1683, Purves contra Keith.</NOTE>. This, in effect, is con|&s;idering the &s;tatute, not as prohibitory of &s;uch purcha&s;es, but mere|ly as laying a tax upon them, &s;imilar to what at pre&s;ent is laid up|on plate, coaches, &amp;c. I mu&s;t take the liberty to &s;ay, that there cannot be a more gro&s;s mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of the &s;pirit or intendment of any &s;tatute than this con&s;truction. Comparing together the &s;ta|tutes contained in both cla&s;&s;es, the only difference concerns the means employ'd for making the prohibition effectual; that be&s;ide the penal|ty, other means may be employ'd by courts of law to repre&s;s the more noxious evils, which cannot be done where the evils are le&s;s noxious. But upon cool reflection every one mu&s;t be of opinion, that with re&s;pect to the prohibition both cla&s;&s;es coincide; and that it mu&s;t be the will of the legi&s;lature to prohibit both equally, becau&s;e both in different degrees are hurtful to the &s;ociety in general, or to part of it. This article is of no &s;light importance. If I have &s;et in a ju&s;t light the &s;pirit and intendment of the foregoing &s;tatutes, it fol|lows of nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, that an act prohibited in a &s;tatute of the &s;econd cla&s;s ought not to be countenanced with an action more than an act prohibited in a &s;tatute of the fir&s;t cla&s;s. Courts of law were in&s;tituted to inforce the will of the national legi&s;lature, as well as of the Great Legi&s;lator of the univer&s;e, and to put in execution mu|nicipal laws as well as tho&s;e of nature. What &s;hall we &s;ay then of a court that &s;upports an act prohibited by a &s;tatute, or authori&s;es any thing contradictory to the will of the legi&s;lature? What el&s;e can we ju&s;tly &s;ay, but that &s;uch proceeding, repugnant to the very de|&s;ign
<PB N="184" REF="193">
of its in&s;titution, is a direct breach of tru&s;t, by acting in oppo&s;i|tion or defiance of the law? It is a breach of tru&s;t of the &s;ame na|ture, though not the &s;ame in degree, with that of &s;u&s;taining action for a bribe promi&s;ed to commit murder or robbery. With regard then to &s;tatutes of this kind, though a court is confined to the pe|nalty, and cannot inflict any other puni&s;hment, it doth by no means follow, that action ought to be &s;u&s;tained for making the act prohi|bited effectual: on the contrary, to &s;u&s;tain action would be flying in the face of the legi&s;lature. The &s;tatute, for example, mentioned above, concerning members of the college of ju&s;tice, is &s;atisfied with the penalty of deprivation, without declaring the bargain null; and therefore to &s;u&s;tain a reduction of the bargain would be to puni&s;h beyond the words, and perhaps beyond the intention of the &s;tatute. But whether action &s;hould be &s;u&s;tained to make the bargain effectual, is a con&s;ideration of a very different nature: the refu&s;ing action in this ca&s;e, is made nece&s;&s;ary by the very con&s;titution of a court of law; it being incon&s;i&s;tent with the de&s;ign of its in&s;titution, to inforce any contract or any deed prohibited by &s;tatute. It follows indeed from the&s;e premi&s;&s;es, that it is left optional to the vender to fulfil the contract or not at his plea&s;ure; for if a court of law cannot inter|po&s;e, he is under no legal compul&s;ion. Nor is this a novelty. In many ca&s;es be&s;ide the pre&s;ent, the rule is applicable <HI>Quod potior e&s;t con|ditio po&s;&s;identis,</HI> where an action will not be given to compel perform|ance, and yet if performance be made, an action will as little be given to recall it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 143.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Pondering this &s;ubject &s;edately and attentively, I can never cea&s;e wondering to find the practice I have been condemning extended to a much &s;tronger ca&s;e, where the purpo&s;e of the legi&s;lature to make an ab&s;olute prohibition is clearly expre&s;&s;ed. The ca&s;e I have in view relates to the revenue-laws, prohibiting certain goods to be im|ported into this i&s;land, or prohibiting them to be imported from certain places named. To import &s;uch goods, or to bargain a|bout their importation, is clearly a contempt of legal authori|ty; and con&s;equently a moral wrong, which the &s;muggler's con|&s;cience ought to check him for, and which it will check him for, if he be not already a hardened &s;inner. And yet, by mi&s;ta|king the nature of prohibitory laws, actions in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion have been every day &s;u&s;tained for making &s;uch &s;muggling-contracts effectual. <Q REND="inline">"Non dubium e&s;t, in legem committere eum, qui verba legis amplexus, contra legis nititur voluntatem.

<P>So much upon the powers of a court of common law with re&s;pect to &s;tatutes. Upon the whole it appears, that this court is confined to the will of the legi&s;lature as expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;tatutory words. It has no power to rectify the words, nor to apply any means for making the purpo&s;e of the legi&s;lature effectual, other than tho&s;e directed by the legi&s;lature, however defective they may be. This imperfection is remedied by a court of equity, which enjoys, and ought to enjoy, the &s;ame powers with re&s;pect to &s;tatutes that are explained above with re&s;pect to deeds and covenants. To give a ju&s;t notion of the&s;e powers concerning the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, the following di&s;tinction will contribute. Statutes, as far as they regard matter of law, and come under the cogni&s;ance of a court of equity, may be divided in|to two cla&s;&s;es. Fir&s;t, Tho&s;e which have ju&s;tice for their object, by &s;upplying the defects, or correcting the inju&s;tice, of common law. Second, Tho&s;e which have utility for their &s;ole object. Statutes of the fir&s;t cla&s;s are intended for no other purpo&s;e but to enlarge the ju|ri&s;diction of courts of common law, by impowering them to di&s;tri|bute ju&s;tice where their ordinary powers reach not: &s;uch &s;tatutes are not nece&s;&s;ary to a court of equity, which, by its original con&s;titu|tion, can &s;upply the defects and correct the inju&s;tice of law: but they have the effect to limit the juri&s;diction of a court of equity; for the remedies afforded by them mu&s;t be put in execution by the courts of common law, and no longer by a court of equity. All that is left to a court of equity concerning a &s;tatute of this kind, is to &s;upply the defects and correct the inju&s;tice of common law, as far as the &s;tatute is incomplete or imperfect; which, in effect, is &s;upplying the defects of the &s;tatute. But it is not a new power be&s;towed upon a court of equity as to &s;tatutes that are imperfect: the court only goes on to exerci&s;e its wonted powers with re&s;pect to matters of ju|&s;tice that are left with it by the &s;tatute, and not be&s;towed upon courts
<PB N="186" REF="195">
of common law. I explain my&s;elf by an example. When goods are wrongou&s;ly taken away, the common law of England gave an action for re&s;titution to none but to the proprietor; and therefore when the goods of a mona&s;tery were pillaged during a vacancy, the &s;uc|ceeding abbot had no action. This defect in law with re&s;pect to ma|terial ju&s;tice, would probably have been left to the court of chancery, had its powers been evolved when the &s;tatute of Marlebirge &s;upplying the defect was made <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">52. Henry III. cap. 29.</NOTE>; but no other remedy occurring, that &s;tatute impowers the judges of common law to &s;u&s;tain action. Had the &s;tatute never exi&s;ted, action would undoubtedly have been &s;u&s;|tained in the court of chancery: all the power that now remains with that court, is to &s;u&s;tain action where the &s;tatute is defective. The &s;tatute enacts, <Q REND="inline">"That the &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hall have an action a|gain&s;t &s;uch tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, for re&s;toring the goods of the mona&s;te|ry."</Q> Attending to the words &s;ingly, which a court of common law mu&s;t do, the remedy is incomplete; for trees cut down and car|ried off are not mentioned. This defect in the &s;tatute, is &s;upplied by the court of chancery. And Coke ob&s;erves, that a &s;tatute which gives remedy for a wrong done, &s;hall be taken by equity.

But that court hath not, more than a court of common law, any power to &s;upply defective &s;tatutes of the former kind; becau&s;e it is not impowered ori|ginally to interpo&s;e in any matter that hath no other tendency but merely to promote the po&s;itive good of the &s;ociety.

<P>THE following is a proper in&s;tance. By the act 250. parliament 1597, <Q REND="inline">"Va&s;&s;als failing to pay their feu-duties for the &s;pace of two years, &s;hall forfeit their feu-rights, in the &s;ame manner as if a clau&s;e irritant were ingro&s;&s;ed in the infeftment."</Q> The forfeiting clau&s;e here is ambiguous: it may either mean an <HI>ip&s;o jure</HI> forfeiture upon elap&s;ing of the two years: or it may mean a forfeiture if the feu-duty be not paid after a regular demand in a proce&s;s. Every ambiguous clau&s;e ought to be &s;o interpreted as to &s;upport the rules of ju&s;tice, becau&s;e &s;uch mu&s;t be con&s;tructed the intendment of the le|gi&s;lature; and that by this rule the latter &s;en&s;e mu&s;t be cho&s;en, will appear from the &s;lighte&s;t reflection. The remedy here provided a|gain&s;t the ob&s;tinacy or negligence of an undutiful va&s;&s;al, could never be intended a trap for the innocent, by forfeiting tho&s;e who have failed in payment through ignorance or inability.

By this method, it is true, the guilty may e&s;cape: but this is far more eligible in common ju&s;tice, than that the innocent be puni&s;hed with the guilty.</P>

<P>IN the act of Charles II. laying a tax on malt-liquors, there are no words directing the tax to be paid, but only a penalty in ca&s;e of not payment. The exchequer, which, like the &s;e&s;&s;ion, is a court both of common law and of equity, &s;upplies the defect; and, in or|der to fulfil the intendment of the &s;tatute, &s;u&s;tains an action for pay|ment of the tax.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ART. III.</HI> Where the words go beyond will.</HEAD>
<P>BY the act 5. parl. 1695, it is enacted, <Q REND="inline">"That hereafter no man binding for and with another conjunctly and &s;everally, in any bond or contract for &s;ums of money, &s;hall be bound longer than &s;even years after the date of the bond."</Q> It appearing to the court, from the nature of the thing, and from other clau&s;es in the &s;tatute, that the words are too exten&s;ive, and that the privilege was intended for none but for cautioners upon who&s;e faith money is lent, they have for that rea&s;on been always in u&s;e to re&s;trict the words, and to deny the privilege to other cautioners.</P>
<P>The act 24. parl. 1695, for making effectual the debts of heirs who after three years po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion die in apparency, is plainly calcu|lated for debts only that are contracted for a valuable con&s;ideration. The act however is expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch exten&s;ive terms, as to compre|hend debts and deeds, gratuitous as well as for a valuable con&s;ide|ration. The court therefore, re&s;tricting the words to the &s;en&s;e of the &s;tatute, never &s;u&s;tains action upon this &s;tatute to gratuitous cre|ditors.</P>
<P>The regulations 1695, admitting no objection again&s;t a decreet|arbitral but bribery and corruption only, reach unwarily beyond the meaning of the legi&s;lature. A decreet-arbitral derives its force from the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and for that rea&s;on every good objection again&s;t a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t operate again&s;t the decreet-arbitral. But a &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion is in its nature a mutual contract; and therefore every objection that in its nature is effectual to cut down the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion as a mutual contract, mu&s;t be equally effectual to cut down the decreet-arbitral founded upon it.</P>

<P>An heir, whether apparent only, or entered <HI>cum beneficio,</HI> cannot act more ju&s;tly with re&s;pect to his predece&s;&s;or's creditors than to bring his predece&s;&s;or's e&s;tate to a judicial &s;ale.

The act 24. parl. 1695, was accordingly made, impowering the heir-apparent to bring to a roup or public auction his predece&s;&s;or's e&s;tate, whether bankrupt or not. But as there is a &s;olid foundation in ju|&s;tice for extending this privilege to the heir entered <HI>cum beneficio,</HI> he is under&s;tood as omitted <HI>per incuriam;</HI> and the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion &s;upplied the defect, by &s;u&s;taining a proce&s;s at the in&s;tance of the heir <HI>cum be|neficio,</HI> for &s;elling his predece&s;&s;or's e&s;tate <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Feb. 27. 1751, Patrick Blair.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By the common law of Scotland, a man's creditors after his death had no preference upon his e&s;tate: the property was transferred to his heir, and the heir's creditors came in for their &s;hare. This was gro&s;s inju&s;tice; for the ance&s;tor's creditors, who lent their money upon the faith of the e&s;tate, ought in all views to have been preferred. The act 24. parl. 1661, made to redre&s;s the inju&s;tice of the common law in this particular, declares, <Q REND="inline">"That the creditors of the predece&s;&s;or do|ing diligence again&s;t the apparent heir, and again&s;t the real e&s;tate which belonged to the defunct, within the &s;pace of three years after his death, &s;hall be preferred to the creditors of the apparent heir."</Q> The remedy here reaching the real e&s;tate only, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion completed the remedy, by extending it to the per&s;onal e&s;tate <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Stair, Dec. 16. 1674, Kilhead contra Irvine.</NOTE>, and al&s;o to a per&s;onal bond limited to a &s;ub&s;titute named <NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Forbes, Feb. 9. 1711, Graham contra Macqueen.</NOTE>.

<P><PB N="191" REF="200">
One &s;tatute there is, or rather clau&s;e in a &s;tatute, which affords a plentiful harve&s;t of in&s;tances. By the principles of common law an heir is intitled to continue the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ance&s;tor; and formerly if he could colour his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion with any &s;ort of title, however ob&s;olete or defective, he enjoy'd the rents; be&s;towing commonly a &s;hare to prevent the creditors from drawing payment out of the e&s;tate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;torical law-tracts, tract 12, toward the clo&s;e.</NOTE>. A|mong many remedies for this flagrant inju&s;tice, there is a clau&s;e in the act 62. parl. 1661, enacting, <Q REND="inline">"That in ca&s;e the apparent heir of any debtor &s;hall acquire right to an expired appri&s;ing, the &s;ame &s;hall be redeemable from him, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, within ten years after acquiring of the &s;ame, by the po&s;terior appri&s;ers, upon payment of the purcha&s;e-money."</Q> This remedy has been extended in many particulars, in order to fulfil the end intended by the legi&s;la|ture. For, 1<HI>mo,</HI> Though the remedy is afforded to appri&s;ers only, it is extended to per&s;onal creditors. 2<HI>do,</HI> It has been extended even to an heir of entail, impowering him to redeem an appri&s;ing of his en|tailed lands after it was purcha&s;ed by the heir of line. 3<HI>tio,</HI> Though no purcha&s;e is mentioned in this clau&s;e but what is made by the heir-apparent, the remedy however is extended again&s;t a pre&s;umptive heir, who cannot be heir-apparent while his ance&s;tor is alive. 4<HI>to,</HI> It was judged, that an appri&s;ing led both again&s;t principal and cautioner, and purcha&s;ed by the heir-apparent of the principal, might be re|deemed by the creditors of the cautioner. This was a &s;tretch, but not beyond the bounds of equity: the cautioner him&s;elf, as creditor for relief, could have redeemed this appri&s;ing in terms of the &s;tatute; and it was thought, that every privilege competent to a debtor ought to be extended to his creditors, in order to make their claims effectual. 5<HI>to,</HI> The privilege is extended to redeem an appri&s;ing during the le|gal, though the &s;tatute mentions only an expired appri&s;ing. And, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> Though the privilege of redemption is limited to ten years af|ter the purcha&s;e made by the heir-apparent, it was judged, that the ten years begin not to run but from the time that the purcha&s;e is known to the creditors. The&s;e deci&s;ions all of them are to be found in the Dictionary, vol. 1. p. 359.</P>

<P>The next branch is of means that are incomplete in every re&s;pect, where the very thing in view of the legi&s;lature is but imperfectly re|medied. Of this take the following illu&s;trious example, which at the &s;ame time furni&s;hes an opportunity to explain the nature and effect of an adjudication after its legal is expired.</P>
<P>An adjudication during the legal is a <HI>pignus praetorium:</HI> and expiry of the legal is held to transfer the property from the debtor to the creditor; preci&s;ely as in a wad&s;et or mortgage, where the redemption is limited within a day certain. Yet the rule which, with relation to a wad&s;et, affords an equity of redemption after the &s;tipulated term of redemption is pa&s;t <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 66.</NOTE>, has never been extended, directly at lea&s;t, to re|lieve again&s;t an expired legal. This &s;ubject therefore is curious, and merits peculiar attention.</P>
<P>In a poinding of moveables the debtor has not an equity of redemp|tion, becau&s;e the moveables are transferred to the creditor at a ju&s;t value. The &s;ame being originally the ca&s;e of an appri&s;ing of land, the legal rever&s;ion of &s;even years introduced by the act 36. parl. 1469, was in reality a privilege be&s;towed upon the debtor, without any foundation in equity; and therefore equity could not &s;upport an ex|ten&s;ion of the rever&s;ion one hour beyond the time limited by the &s;ta|tute. But the nature of an appri&s;ing was totally rever&s;ed by an op|pre&s;&s;ive and di&s;hone&s;t practice of attaching land for payment of debt, without pre&s;erving any mea&s;ure between the debt and the value of the land; by which great portions of land were &s;ometimes carried off for payment of incon&s;iderable &s;ums. An appri&s;ing, as originally con&s;ti|tuted, was a judicial &s;ale for a ju&s;t price: but an execution, by which land at random is attached for payment of debt without regarding its value, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be a &s;ale for a ju&s;t price: it ought to have been reprobated as without any foundation in law. But indulging it with the utmo&s;t favour, it would be flagrant inju&s;tice to hold it for any thing better than a <HI>pignus praetorium,</HI> a &s;ecurity for payment of debt. Accordingly the act 6. parl. 1621, con&s;iders it in that light, enact|ing, <Q REND="inline">"That appri&s;ers &s;hall be accountable for their intromi&s;&s;ions with|in the legal, fir&s;t in extinction of the intere&s;t, and thereafter of the capital;"</Q> which, in effect, is declaring the property to remain with the debtor, as no man is bound to account for rents that are his own. And it is con&s;idered in the &s;ame light by the act 62. parl. 1661,
<Q REND="inline"><PB N="193" REF="202">
"ranking <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with the fir&s;t effectual appri&s;ing, all other appri|&s;ings led within year and day of it:"</Q> creditors real or per&s;onal may be ranked upon a common &s;ubject <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u,</HI> or in what order the le|gi&s;lature thinks proper; but &s;uch ranking is incompatible with the nature of property <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Stair declares po&s;itively for this doctrine. <Q REND="inline">"An appri&s;ing is truly a <HI>pignus praetorium:</HI> the debtor is not denuded, but his infeftment &s;tands. And if the appri&s;ing be &s;atisfied within the legal, it is extingui&s;hed, and the debtor need not be re-inve&s;ted. Therefore he may re|ceive va&s;&s;als during the legal; and if he die during the legal, his apparent heir, intromitting with the mails and duties, doth behave him&s;elf as heir;"</Q> <BIBL><HI>book</HI> 2. <HI>tit.</HI> 10. &sect; 1.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>An appri&s;ing then, according to its later model, or, in place of it, an adjudication, is, during the legal, a <HI>pignus praetorium</HI> only, or a ju|dicial &s;ecurity for debt; and the que&s;tion is, Whether, after this alte|ration, it be converted into a title of property upon expiry of the legal? The act 1621 above mentioned goes no further than to make appri&s;ers accountable for their intromi&s;&s;ion within the legal; and if they be not accountable thereafter, the inference &s;eems fair that upon that account they mu&s;t be held to be proprietors. This inference, however plau&s;i|ble, amounts not to a certainty: it is con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tatute that an appri&s;ing may continue a <HI>pignus praetorium</HI> after the legal as well as before, with the following difference, that like a proper wad&s;etter the appri&s;er &s;hall not be accountable after the legal. But even &s;uppo&s;ing the inference to be invincible, it remains to be con&s;idered how far a court of equity is bound by it. The &s;tatute makes appri&s;ers account|able during the legal; but there it &s;tops &s;hort, and does not &s;ay that <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> upon expiration of the legal, an appri&s;ing, from a <HI>pignus praetorium,</HI> is converted into a title of property. However clear the in|ference may be, it is only an argument drawn by rea&s;oning, and has no direct authority from the &s;tatute: it does not appear that the legi&s;|lature intended this inference, or &s;o much as fore&s;aw it. A court of equity then, though it has no power to overturn expre&s;s law, is not bound by any argument drawn from a &s;tatute, except as far as that argument is &s;upported by the rules of ju&s;tice. And in that view we proceed to inquire, what are the rules of ju&s;tice with re&s;pect to an ap|pri&s;ing or an adjudication after expiration of the legal.</P>
<P>According to the original form of an appri&s;ing, requiring a &s;trict e|quality between the debt and the value of the land, it was rational and ju&s;t, that the property of the land &s;hould in&s;tantly be transferred to the creditor in &s;atisfaction of the debt; but it could no longer be rational or ju&s;t to transfer the property after it became cu&s;tomary to attach land at random without regarding its extent. The debtor's
<PB N="194" REF="203">
whole land-e&s;tate was appri&s;ed, and is now adjudged by every &s;ingle creditor, however &s;mall his debt may be; and therefore to transfer to an appri&s;er or adjudger the property of the land <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> upon the debtor's failure to make payment within the legal, would be a penal irritancy of the &s;evere&s;t kind. On the other hand, this &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> transference of the property is penal upon the creditor where the land adjudged by him happens to be le&s;s in value than his debt: in that ca&s;e it would be glaring inju&s;tice to force the land upon him in payment of his debt. Nay more, it is repugnant to fir&s;t principles, that a man &s;hould be compelled to take land for his debt, however valuable the land may be: it may be his choice to continue po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as creditor after the legal as well as before; and this mu&s;t be under|&s;tood his choice, if he do no act importing the contrary. To relieve the creditor as well as debtor from the foregoing hard&s;hips, equity &s;teers a middle cour&s;e. It admits not an <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> transference of the property, upon expiry of the legal; but only gives the creditor an option, either to continue in his former &s;ituation, or to take the land for his debt; which option mu&s;t be declared in a proce&s;s, intitled <HI>a declarator of expiry of the legal.</HI> This removes all hard&s;hips: land is not impo&s;ed upon the creditor again&s;t his will: the debtor, on the other hand, has an opportunity to purge his failure, by making pay|ment; and if he &s;uffer a decree to pa&s;s without offering payment, it is ju&s;t that the property be transferred to the creditor in &s;atisfaction of the debt; for judicial proceedings ought not for ever to be kept in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Thus the law is &s;o con&s;tructed as to make the property be transferrable only, and not to be transferred but by the intervention of a declarator. And the declarator here &s;erves the &s;ame double pur|po&s;e that it &s;erves in the <HI>lex commi&s;&s;oria in pignoribus:</HI> it is a declaration of the creditor's will to accept the land for his money; and it relieves the debtor from the forfeiture of a penal irritancy, by admitting him to purge at any time before the declaratory decree pa&s;s.</P>
<P>We proceed to examine how far the practice of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion concerning appri&s;ings and adjudications is conformable to the prin|ciples of equity above laid down. And I mu&s;t prepare my reader be|forehand to expect here the &s;ame wavering and fluctuation between common law and equity, that, in the cour&s;e of this work, is di&s;cover|ed in many other in&s;tances. I ob&s;erve, in the fir&s;t place, That though the court, adhering to common law, has not hitherto &s;u&s;tained to the debtor an equity of redemption after expiry of the legal, yet that the &s;ame thing in effect is done indirectly, through the influence of equity. Some pretext or other of informality is always embraced to
<PB N="195" REF="204">
open an expired legal, in order to afford the debtor an opportunity to redeem his land by payment of the debt. And this matter has been carried &s;o far as to open the legal to the effect &s;olely of intitling the debtor to make payment, holding the legal as expired with re&s;pect to other effects, &s;uch as that of relieving the creditor from accounting for the rents levied by him, unle&s;s during the ten years that the legal is current by &s;tatute <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes, February 2. 1711, Guthrie contra Gordon.</NOTE>. Here is a &s;trange jumble between common law and equity: the freeing the creditor from accounting for the rents after the ten years, &s;uppo&s;es the property to have been transferred to him <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> by the lap&s;e of the&s;e years: and yet the admitting pay|ment to be made after the ten years, is &s;uppo&s;ing that the property is not transferred before a declarator of expiry of the legal; for upon no other &s;uppo&s;ition can payment be forc'd upon the adjudger after the &s;tatutory rever&s;ion is expired.</P>
<P>In another particular our practice is &s;till le&s;s con&s;i&s;tent, if po&s;&s;ible, with any ju&s;t principles. With re&s;pect to the adjudger, it is ju&s;tly held, that the debt due to him cannot be extingui&s;hed without his con&s;ent; whence it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that, even after the legal is expired, the adjudger mu&s;t have an option, to adhere to his debt, or to take the land in place of it. This rule is e&s;tabli&s;hed in our pre&s;ent practice; and what man is &s;o blind as not to perceive what follows from the rule? An adjudger, upon who&s;e will it depends to continue to be a creditor, or to take him&s;elf to the land in place of his debt, cannot already be proprietor of that land: before the property can be transferred to him, he mu&s;t interpo&s;e his will, which is done by a declarator; and &s;o far our practice proceeds upon ju&s;t principles. But whether what is held with re&s;pect to the debtor be con&s;i&s;tent with that practice, we next inquire. We hold, that the debtor's power of re|demption is confined within the legal; that, by expiry of the legal, he is forfeited <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> of his property; and that thereafter he has no power to redeem, or to purge his failure of payment. Here we find one opinion incon&s;i&s;tent with another, and the &s;ame incon&s;i&s;tence in different branches of our practice: with re&s;pect to the creditor, the property is not his, till he chu&s;e to in&s;i&s;t in a declarator of expiry of the legal: with re&s;pect to the debtor again, the property without a declarator is lo&s;t to him <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> by expiry of the legal. Can any man &s;ay who is proprietor in the interim? The&s;e notions with re&s;pect to the &s;ame point cannot be reconciled; but the cau&s;e of them may be accounted for. In all our practice we find a &s;trong leaning to cre|ditors
<PB N="196" REF="205">
in oppo&s;ition to their debtors. A propen&s;ity in favour of cre|ditors hath be&s;towed upon an appri&s;er the equitable privilege of an option between the debt, and the land upon which it is &s;ecured: the rigor, on the other hand, with which debtors are treated, has denied them the equitable privilege of purging an irritant clau&s;e at any time before the door be &s;hut again&s;t them by a declaratory decree.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. Where the means enacted reach unwarily beyond the end purpo&s;ed by the legi&s;lature.</HEAD>
<P>BY the &s;tatute 9^o <HI>Annae, cap.</HI> 13. <Q REND="inline">"The per&s;on who at one time lo&s;es the &s;um or value of L. 10 Sterling at game, and pays the &s;ame, &s;hall be at liberty within three months to &s;ue for and recover the money or goods &s;o lo&s;t, with co&s;ts of &s;uit. And in ca&s;e the lo|&s;er &s;hall not within the time fore&s;aid really and <HI>bona fide</HI> bring his action, it &s;hall be lawful for any one to &s;ue for the &s;ame, and triple value thereof, with co&s;ts of &s;uit."</Q> Here there is no limitation mentioned with re&s;pect to the popular action; nor, as far as con|cerns England, is it nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e, by the Engli&s;h &s;tatute 31&s;t Eliz. cap. 5. <Q REND="inline">"no action &s;hall be &s;u&s;tained upon any penal &s;tatute made or to be made, unle&s;s within one year of the offence."</Q> A li|miting clau&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary with regard to Scotland only, to which the &s;aid &s;tatute of Elizabeth reacheth not; and therefore, as there is no limitation expre&s;&s;ed in the act, a court of common law in Scotland mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain the popular action for forty years, contrary evidently to the will of the legi&s;lature, which never intended a penal &s;tatute to be perpetual in Scotland, that in England is circum&s;cribed within a year. It belongs therefore to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion to limit this &s;tatute, by deny|ing action if not brought within one year after the offence; for it cer|tainly was not the intention of the legi&s;lature to di&s;tingui&s;h Scotland from England with re&s;pect to pre&s;cription of penal actions. Hence in the deci&s;ion January 19. 1737, Murray contra Cowan, where an action was &s;u&s;tained even after the year for recovering money lo&s;t at play, with the triple value, it clearly appears, that the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion act|ed as a court of common law, and not as a court of equity.</P>
<P>The act 6. parl. 1672, requires, <Q REND="inline">"That all executions of &s;ummons &s;hall bear expre&s;sly the names and de&s;ignations of the pur&s;uers and defenders."</Q> This regulation was nece&s;&s;ary in order to con|nect
<PB N="197" REF="206">
the execution with the &s;ummons. For as at that period it was common to write an execution upon a paper apart, bearing a refer|ence in general to the &s;ummons, in the following manner, <Q REND="inline">"That the parties within expre&s;&s;ed were lawfully cited,"</Q> &amp;c. the execu|tion of one &s;ummons might be applied to any other, &s;o as to become legal evidence of a citation that was never given. But as there can be no opportunity for this abu&s;e when an execution is writ upon the back of the &s;ummons, it belongs to a court of equity, with re&s;pect to a ca&s;e where the &s;tatutory remedy is unnece&s;&s;ary, to relieve &s;o far from the enacting clau&s;e; which is done by declaring, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary to name the pur&s;uers and defenders when the execution is writ on the back of the &s;ummons *.</P>

<P>The &s;tatutes introducing the po&s;itive and negative pre&s;criptions, have for their object public utility; and the &s;upplying defects in the&s;e &s;tatutes re&s;ts upon the &s;ame principle; a &s;ubject that belongs to the next book, which contains the proceedings of a court of equity acting upon the principle of utility. But to mitigate the&s;e &s;tatutes with re&s;pect to articles that happen to be oppre&s;&s;ive or unju&s;t, is a branch of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject; and to examples of that kind I pro|ceed. Common law, which limits not actions within any time, af|fords great opportunity for unju&s;t claims, which, however ill found|ed originally, are brought &s;o late as to be &s;ecure again&s;t all detection. It is not wrong in common law to &s;u&s;tain an old claim, for a claim may be very old and yet very ju&s;t: but to &s;u&s;tain claims with|out any limitation of time, gives great &s;cope to fraud and forgery, and for that rea&s;on public utility required a limitation. Upon that principle the &s;tatutes 1469 and 1474 were made, denying action up|on debts and other claims beyond forty years. A court of common law proceeding upon the&s;e &s;tatutes, cannot &s;u&s;tain action after forty years, even where a claim is evidently well founded, as where it is proved to be &s;o by referring it to the oath of the defendant. In this ca&s;e the means enacted go evidently beyond the end purpo&s;ed by the legi&s;lature; which intended only to &s;ecure again&s;t &s;u&s;picious and ill|founded <NOTE PLACE="foot">^1 Feb. 20. 1755, Sir William Dunbar contra John Macleod younger of Macleod.</NOTE>
<PB N="198" REF="207">
claims, not to cut off any ju&s;t debt; and in this view no|thing farther could be intended than to introduce a pre&s;umption a|gain&s;t every claim brought after forty years; re&s;erving to the pur|&s;uer to bring po&s;itive evidence of its being a &s;ub&s;i&s;ting claim, and ju&s;tly due. Yet the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, acting as a court of common law, did in one ca&s;e refu&s;e to &s;u&s;tain action after the forty years, though the debt was offered to be proved by the oath of the defend|ant <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, Dec. 7. 1703, Napier contra Campbell.</NOTE>. In another point they act properly as a court of equity. Per|&s;ons under age are relieved from the effect of the&s;e &s;tatutes, for an ex|treme good rea&s;on, that no pre&s;umption can lie again&s;t a creditor while under age, for delaying to bring his action.</P>
<P>The &s;ame con&s;truction in equity is given to the Engli&s;h act of limi|tation concerning per&s;onal actions: it is held, That a bare acknow|ledgement of the debt is &s;ufficient to bar the limitation <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Abridg. of the law, vol. 3 p. 517.</NOTE>; importing, that the legi&s;lature intended not to extingui&s;h a ju&s;t debt, but only to introduce a pre&s;umption of payment. But with this doctrine I cannot reconcile what &s;eems to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Engli&s;h courts of equity, <Q REND="inline">"That if a man by will or deed &s;ubject his land to the pay|ment of his debts, debts barred by the &s;tatute of limitations &s;hall be paid; for they are debts in equity, and the &s;tatute hath not ex|tingui&s;hed the obligation, though it hath taken away the reme|dy <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 518.</NOTE>."</Q> This differs widely from the equitable con&s;truction of the &s;tatute; for if its intendment be to pre&s;ume &s;uch debts paid, they cannot even in equity be con&s;idered as debts, unle&s;s the &s;tatutory pre|&s;umption be removed by contrary evidence. The following ca&s;e pro|ceeds upon the &s;ame mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of the &s;tatute: <Q REND="inline">"It hath al&s;o been ruled in equity, that if a man has a debt due to him by note, or a book-debt, and has made no demand of it for &s;ix years, &s;o that he is barred by the &s;tatute of limitations; yet if the debtor or his executor, after the &s;ix years, puts out an adverti&s;ement in the Gazette, or any other news-paper, that all per&s;ons who have any debts owing to them may apply to &s;uch a place, and that they &s;hall be paid; this, though general, (and therefore might be in|tended of legal &s;ub&s;i&s;ting debts only), yet amounts to &s;uch an ac|knowledgement of that debt which was barred, as will revive the right, and bring it out of the &s;tatute again <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>To the ca&s;e fir&s;t mentioned, of referring a debt to the defendant's oath, a maxim in the law of England is obviou&s;ly applicable,
<Q REND="inline"><PB N="199" REF="208">
"That a ca&s;e out of the mi&s;chief, is out of the meaning of the law, though it be within the letter."</Q> A claim, of whatever age, refer|red to the defendant's oath, is plainly out of the mi&s;chief intended to be remedied by the foregoing &s;tatutes; and therefore ought not to be regulated by the words, which in this ca&s;e go beyond the end propo&s;ed. Coke<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 In&s;tit. 106.</NOTE> illu&s;trates this maxim by the following example. The common law of England &s;uffered goods taken by di&s;tre&s;s to be driven where the creditor plea&s;ed; which was mi&s;chievous, becau&s;e the tenant, who mu&s;t give his cattle &s;u&s;tenance, could have no know|ledge where they were. This mi&s;chief was remedied by &s;tatute 3. Edward I. cap. 16. enacting, <Q REND="inline">"That goods taken by di&s;tre&s;s &s;hall not be carried out of the &s;hire where they are taken."</Q> Yet, &s;ays our author, if the tenancy be in one county and the manor in ano|ther, the lord may drive the di&s;tre&s;s to his manor, contrary to the words of the &s;tatute; for the tenant, by doing of &s;uit and &s;ervice to the manor, is pre&s;umed to know what is done there.</P>
<P>The act 83. parl. 1579, introducing a triennial pre&s;cription of &s;hop-accounts, &amp;c. is directed to the judges, enacting, <Q REND="inline">"That they &s;hall not &s;u&s;tain action after three years,"</Q> without making any di&s;tinction between natives and foreigners. Nor is there rea&s;on for making a di&s;tinction; becau&s;e every claimant, native or foreigner, mu&s;t bring his action for payment in the country where the debtor re&s;ides; and for that rea&s;on both equally ought to guard again&s;t the pre&s;cription of that country. When &s;uch is the law of pre&s;cription in general, and of the act 1579 in particu|lar, I cannot avoid condemning the following deci&s;ion. <Q REND="inline">"In a pur&s;uit for an account of drugs, furni&s;hed from time to time by a London druggi&s;t to an Edinburgh apothecary, the court repelled the defence of the triennial pre&s;cription, and decreed, That the act of limitation in England, being the <HI>locus contractus,</HI> mu&s;t be the rule <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">November 1731, Fulks contra Aikenhead.</NOTE>."</Q> This deci&s;ion is erroneous, not only for the rea&s;on above given, but al&s;o for a &s;eparate rea&s;on. The Engli&s;h &s;tatute of limitation has no authority with us, otherwi&s;e than as inferring a pre&s;umption of payment from the delay of bringing an action with|in &s;ix years; and this pre&s;umption cannot ari&s;e where the debtor is abroad, either in Scotland or beyond &s;eas.</P>
<P>If the pre&s;cription of the country where the debtor dwells be the rule, which every creditor foreign or dome&s;tic ought to have in view, it follows nece&s;&s;arily, that a defendant, to take advantage of the pre|&s;cription
<PB N="200" REF="209">
of the country where the action is brought again&s;t him, mu&s;t be able to qualify his re&s;idence there during the whole cour&s;e of the pre&s;cription. While the debtor re&s;ides in England, for exam|ple, or in Holland, the creditor has no rea&s;on to be upon his guard again&s;t the Scotch triennial pre&s;cription: and &s;uppo&s;ing the action to be brought the next day after the debtor &s;ettles in Scotland, it would be ab&s;urd that the creditor &s;hould be cut out by the trien|nial pre&s;cription. I illu&s;trate this doctrine by a plain ca&s;e. A &s;hop|keeper in London furni&s;hes goods to a man who has his re&s;idence there. The creditor, tru&s;ting to the Engli&s;h &s;tatute of limitation, reckons him&s;elf &s;ecure if he bring his action within &s;ix years; but is forc'd to bring his action in Scotland, to which the debtor re|tires after three years. It would in this ca&s;e be gro&s;s inju&s;tice, to &s;u&s;tain the Scotch triennial pre&s;cription as a bar to the action. This never could be the intention of our legi&s;lature; and in this view the means enacted in the &s;tatute 1579 are unwarily too exten&s;ive, forbid|ding action after three years, without limiting the defence to the ca&s;e where the defendant has been all that time in Scotland. The &s;ta|tute therefore ought to be limited to the ca&s;e now mentioned, which will make it corre&s;pond to ju&s;tice and to the intendment of the le|gi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Equity is al&s;o applied to mitigate the rigor of &s;tatute-law with re|&s;pect to evidence. By the Engli&s;h &s;tatute of frauds and perjuries <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">29. Charles II. cap. 3.</NOTE>, it is enacted, <Q REND="inline">"That all lea&s;es, e&s;tates, intere&s;ts of freehold or terms of years, made or created by parole and not put in writing, &s;hall have the force and effect of lea&s;es or e&s;tates at will only."</Q> In the con&s;truction of this &s;tatute the following point was re&s;olved, That if there be a parole-agreement for the purcha&s;e of land, and that in a bill brought for a &s;pecific execution the &s;ub&s;tance of the agreement be &s;et forth in the bill, and confe&s;&s;ed in the defendant's an&s;wer, the court will decree a &s;pecific execution, becau&s;e in this ca&s;e there is no dan|ger of perjury, which was the only thing the &s;tatute intended to pre|vent <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Abridg. ca&s;es in equity, ch. 4. &s;ect. B. &sect; 3.</NOTE>. Again, whatever evidence may be required by law, yet it would be unju&s;t to &s;uffer any man to take advantage of the defect of evidence, when the defect is occa&s;ioned by his own fraud. And ac|cordingly there are many in&s;tances in the Engli&s;h law-books, where a parole-agreement intended to be reduced in writing, but prevented by fraud, has been decreed in equity, notwith&s;tanding the &s;tatute of

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Powers of a court of equity to remedy what is imperfect in common law with re&s;pect to tran&s;actions between debtor and creditor.</HEAD>
<P>IN the&s;e tran&s;actions we find daily in&s;tances of oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;ome|times by the creditor, &s;ometimes by the debtor, authori&s;ed by one or other general rule of common law, which happens to be unju&s;t when applied to &s;ome &s;ingular ca&s;e out of the rea&s;on of the rule. In every ca&s;e of this kind, it is the duty of a court of equity, to in|terpo&s;e, and to relieve from the oppre&s;&s;ion. To tru&s;t this power with &s;ome court is evidently a matter of nece&s;&s;ity, for otherwi&s;e wrong would be authori&s;ed without remedy. Such oppre&s;&s;ion appears in different &s;hapes and in different circum&s;tances, which I &s;hall endea|vour to di&s;tingui&s;h by arranging them under different heads; begin|ning with the oppre&s;&s;ion a creditor may commit under protection of common law, and then proceeding to what may be committed by a debtor.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. Inju&s;tice of common law with re&s;pect to compen&s;ation.</HEAD>
<P>BY the common law of this land, when a debtor is &s;ued for pay|ment, it will afford no defence that the plaintiff owes him an e|quivalent &s;um. This &s;um he may demand in a &s;eparate action; but in the mean time, if he make not payment of the &s;um demanded from him, a decree will i&s;&s;ue again&s;t him to be followed with execu|tion. Now this is rigorous, or rather unju&s;t. For, with re&s;pect to
<PB N="202" REF="211">
the plaintiff, unle&s;s he mean to oppre&s;s, he cannot wi&s;h better pay|ment than to be di&s;charged of the debt he owes the defendant. And, with re&s;pect to the defendant, it is gro&s;s inju&s;tice to &s;ubject him to the mo&s;t rigorous execution for failing to pay a debt, when po&s;&s;ibly the only means he has for payment is that very &s;um which the plain|tiff detains from him. To that act of inju&s;tice, however, the com|mon law lends its authority, by a general rule, impowering every creditor to proceed to execution when his debtor fails to make pay|ment. But that rule, however ju&s;t in the main, was never intended to take place in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; and therefore a court of equity remedies an act of inju&s;tice occa&s;ioned by a too exten&s;ive application of the rule beyond the rea&s;on and intention of the law. The remedy is, to order an account in place of payment, and the one debt to be hit off again&s;t the other. This is termed the <HI>privilege of compen&s;ation,</HI> which always furni&s;hes a good defence again&s;t payment where there is a counter-claim. Compen&s;ation accordingly was in old Rome &s;u&s;|tained before the Praetor; and in England has long been received in courts of equity. In Scotland indeed it has the authority of a &s;ta|tute <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 143. parl. 1592.</NOTE>; which it &s;eems was thought nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e at that period the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion was probably not under&s;tood to be a court of e|quity <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Introduction.</NOTE>. But perhaps there was a further view, <HI>viz.</HI> to introduce compen&s;ation as a defence into courts of common law; and with that preci&s;e view did compen&s;ation lately obtain the authority of a &s;tatute in England <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">2. Geo. II. cap. 22. &sect; 11.</NOTE>: the defence of compen&s;ation was always ad|mitted in the court of chancery; but by authority of the &s;tatute, it is now al&s;o admitted in courts of common law.</P>
<P>In applying the foregoing &s;tatute introducing compen&s;ation, a court of equity hath more exten&s;ive powers than a court of common law. A court of common law is tied to the letter of the &s;tatute, and has no privilege to inquire into its motive. But the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, as a court of equity, may &s;upply its defects and correct its exce&s;&s;es. Yet I know not by what mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, with regard to this &s;tatute, hath always con&s;idered it&s;elf as a court of common law, and not as a court of equity; a mi&s;apprehen&s;ion the le&s;s excu&s;able, con&s;idering the &s;ubject of the &s;tatute, a matter of e|quity, which the court it&s;elf could have introduced had the &s;tatute never been made. I &s;hall make this reflection plain, by entering into particulars. The &s;tatute authori&s;es compen&s;ation to be pleaded
<PB N="203" REF="212">
in the original proce&s;s only, by way of exception, and gives no au|thority to plead it whether in the reduction or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of a decree. The words are, <Q REND="inline">"That a liquid debt be admitted by way of excep|tion before decreet by all judges, but not in a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion nor re|duction of the decreet."</Q> This limitation is proper in two views. The fir&s;t is, that if a defendant omit or forbear to plead compen&s;a|tion in the original proce&s;s, the judgement is notwith&s;tanding ju&s;t; and the forbearing or omitting to u&s;e a privilege given by law, is not a good rea&s;on for challenging a judgement whether in a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or reduction. The other view is, that it would afford too great &s;cope for litigio&s;ity were defendants indulged to re&s;erve their articles of compen&s;ation as a ground for &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or reduction. Attend|ing to the&s;e views, a judgement purely in ab&s;ence ought not to bar compen&s;ation, becau&s;e judgements are often pronounced when the party hath not an opportunity to appear. For that rea&s;on, a party who is re&s;tored to his defences in a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, upon &s;howing that his ab&s;ence was not contumacious, ought to be at liberty to plead every defence, whether in equity or at common law. And yet our judges con&s;tantly reject compen&s;ation when pleaded in a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of a de|cree in ab&s;ence, though that ca&s;e comes not under the rea&s;on and motive of the &s;tatute. The &s;tatute, in my apprehen&s;ion, admits of &s;till greater latitude; which is, that after a decree <HI>in foro</HI> is &s;u&s;pend|ed for any good rea&s;on, compen&s;ation may be received in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion; for the &s;tatute goes no farther than to prohibit a decree to be &s;u&s;pended merely upon compen&s;ation. Nor can it have any bad effect to admit compen&s;ation when a cau&s;e is brought un|der review by &s;u&s;pen&s;ion becau&s;e of iniquity committed in the origi|nal proce&s;s: on the contrary, it is beneficial to both by preventing a new law-&s;uit.</P>
<P>If the deci&s;ions of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion upon the different articles of this &s;tatute &s;how a &s;lavi&s;h dependence on the common law; the deci|&s;ions which regulate ca&s;es of compen&s;ation not provided for by the &s;tatute breathe a freer &s;pirit, being governed by true principles of e|quity. I proceed to the&s;e ca&s;es. The fir&s;t that pre&s;ents it&s;elf, is, where one only of the two concurring debts bears intere&s;t. What &s;hall be the effect of compen&s;ation in that ca&s;e? Shall the principal and intere&s;t be brought down to the time of pleading compen&s;ation, and be &s;et off at that period again&s;t the other debt which bears not intere&s;t? Or &s;hall the accompt be in&s;tituted as at the time of the con|cour&s;e, as if from that period intere&s;t were no longer due? Equity evidently concludes for the latter; for it con&s;iders, that each had the
<PB N="204" REF="213">
u&s;e of the other's money, and that it is not ju&s;t the one &s;hould have a claim for intere&s;t while the other has none: intere&s;t is a premium for the u&s;e of money, and my creditor in effect gets that premium by having from me the u&s;e of an equivalent &s;um. And accordingly it is the con&s;tant practice of the court to &s;tay the cour&s;e of intere&s;t from the time the two debts concur. But this can only hold where the compen&s;ation is mutual; for a debtor who cannot retain by compen|&s;ation is &s;uppo&s;ed to have the money always ready to meet a demand: in which &s;ituation it would be unju&s;t to oblige him to pay 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> premium, or any premium, for money that mu&s;t lie dead in his hand without being put to any u&s;e; and yet this in effect would be done, were this dead &s;um admitted to operate <HI>retro,</HI> &s;o as to cut down a debt due to him bearing intere&s;t. Example. A tack&s;man lends a con&s;iderable &s;um to his landlord, agreeing in the bond to &s;u&s;pend the payment during the currency of the tack, but &s;tipulating to him&s;elf a power to retain the intere&s;t annually out of the tack-duty. The tack&s;|man makes punctual payment of the &s;urplus tack-duties, &s;o often as demanded: but, by &s;ome di&s;order in the landlord's affairs, a con&s;ider|able arrear is allowed to remain in the hands of the tack&s;man. The landlord endeavouring to make the tack-duties in arrear operate <HI>retro</HI> again&s;t the bonded debt, &s;o as to extingui&s;h &s;ome part of the princi|pal annually, the <HI>retro</HI> operation was not admitted in this ca&s;e: be|cau&s;e, in terms of the contract, the tack&s;man was bound to keep in his hand the &s;urplus tack-duties ready to be paid on demand; and for that rea&s;on it would be unju&s;t to make him pay intere&s;t for this &s;um; or, which comes to the &s;ame, it would be unju&s;t to make it o|perate <HI>retro,</HI> by applying it annually in extinction of the bonded debt bearing intere&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">July 21. 1756, Campbell contra Carruthers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In applying compen&s;ation both claims mu&s;t be pure; for it is not equitable to delay paying a debt of which the term is pa&s;t, upon pre|text of a counter-claim that cannot at pre&s;ent be demanded, or that is uncertain as to its extent. But what if in this ca&s;e the pur&s;uer be bankrupt, or <HI>vergens ad inopiam?</HI> The common law authori&s;es a bankrupt to in&s;i&s;t for payment equally with a per&s;on &s;olvent: but it never was the intention of the common law to oblige me to pay what I owe to a bankrupt, and to leave me without remedy as to what he owes me. This therefore is a proper ca&s;e for the interpo&s;ition of equity. It cannot authori&s;e compen&s;ation in circum&s;tances that afford not place for it; but it can prevent the mi&s;chief in the mo&s;t natural man|ner, by obliging the bankrupt to find &s;ecurity to make good the coun|ter-claim
<PB N="205" REF="214">
when it &s;hall become due; and this is the con&s;tant practice of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Compen&s;ation would be but an imperfect remedy again&s;t the op|pre&s;&s;ion of the common law, if it could not be applied otherwi&s;e than by exception. The &s;tatute, it is true, extends the remedy no farther; but the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, upon a principle of equity, affords a remedy where the &s;tatute is &s;ilent. Suppo&s;ing two mutual debts, of which the one only bears intere&s;t, the creditor in the barren debt demands his money; which the debtor pays without pleading compen&s;ation, and then demands the debt due to him&s;elf with the intere&s;t. Or let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that payment of the barren debt is offered, which the creditor mu&s;t accept, however &s;en&s;ible of the hard&s;hip. In the&s;e ca&s;es there is no opportunity to apply the equitable maxim, That both &s;ums &s;hould bear intere&s;t, or neither. Therefore, to give opportuni|ty for applying that maxim, a proce&s;s of mutual extinction of the two debts ought to be &s;u&s;tained to the creditor who&s;e &s;um is barren; to have effect <HI>retro</HI> from the time of concour&s;e: and this proce&s;s accor|dingly is always &s;u&s;tained in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We next take under con&s;ideration the ca&s;e of an a&s;&s;ignee. And the fir&s;t que&s;tion is, Whether the proce&s;s of mutual extinction now men|tioned be competent again&s;t an a&s;&s;ignee. To prevent mi&s;takes in jud|ging of this que&s;tion, let it be under&s;tood, that an a&s;&s;ignment intimated is, by our pre&s;ent practice, a proper <HI>ce&s;&s;io in jure,</HI> transterring the claim <HI>funditus</HI> from the a&s;&s;ignor or cedent to the a&s;&s;ignee. This being taken for granted, it follows, that compen&s;ation cannot be pleaded again&s;t an a&s;&s;ignee: for though one of the claims is now transferred to him, that circum&s;tance &s;ubjects him not to the counter-claim; and there|fore there is no mutual concour&s;e of debts between the parties, upon which to found a compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that the claim bearing intere&s;t is that which is a&s;|&s;igned. This claim, principal and intere&s;t, mu&s;t be paid to the a&s;&s;ig|nee, becau&s;e he is not &s;ubjected to the counter-claim. Mu&s;t then the a&s;&s;ignee's debtor, after paying the principal and intere&s;t, be &s;atisfied to demand from the cedent the &s;um due to him&s;elf which bears not intere&s;t? At that rate, the creditor who&s;e claim bears intere&s;t, will al|ways take care by an a&s;&s;ignment to prevent compen&s;ation. This hard&s;hip is a &s;ufficient ground for the interpo&s;ition of a court of equi|ty. If the cedent hath procured an undue advantage to him&s;elf, by making a &s;um bear intere&s;t in the name of an a&s;&s;ignee, which would not bear intere&s;t in his own name; he ought to be deprived of that undue advantage, to make up what his debtor &s;uffers by the a&s;&s;ign|ment.
<PB N="206" REF="215">
And the proper reparation is to oblige him to pay intere&s;t <HI>ex aequitate,</HI> though the claim naturally bears none.</P>
<P>But if the debt a&s;&s;igned be that which bears not intere&s;t, a total &s;eparation is thereby made between the two debts, &s;o as to bar com|pen&s;ation altogether. And what after this can prevent the counter-claim with its intere&s;t from being made effectual again&s;t the cedent? No objection in equity can ari&s;e to him, &s;eeing, with his eyes open, he deprived him&s;elf of the opportunity of compen&s;ation, the only mean he had to avoid paying intere&s;t upon the counter-claim.</P>
<P>In handling compen&s;ation as directed by equity, I have hitherto con&s;idered what the law ought to be, and have carefully avoided the intricacies of our practice, which in &s;everal particulars is gro&s;sly er|roneous. To complete the &s;ubject, I mu&s;t take a &s;urvey of that practice, the errors of which will be the more ea&s;ily apprehended af|ter what is already &s;aid. By our old law, derived from that of the Romans, and from England, a creditor could not a&s;&s;ign his claim: all he could do was to grant a procuratory <HI>in rem &s;uam,</HI> which did not transfer the <HI>jus crediti</HI> to the a&s;&s;ignee, but only intitled him <HI>procu|ratorio nomine</HI> to demand payment. From the nature of this title it was thought, that compen&s;ation might be pleaded again&s;t the a&s;|&s;ignee as well as again&s;t the cedent: and indeed, con&s;idering the title &s;ingly, the opinion was right; becau&s;e the pleading compen&s;ation a|gain&s;t a procurator or a&s;&s;ignee, is in reality pleading it again&s;t the cedent or creditor him&s;elf. The opinion however is erroneous, and the error ari&s;es from overlooking the capital circum&s;tance, which is the equitable right that the a&s;&s;ignee, though con&s;idered as a procura|tor only, hath to the claim a&s;&s;igned, by having paid a price for it. Equity will never &s;ubject &s;uch a procurator or a&s;&s;ignee to the cedent's debts, whether in the way of payment or compen&s;ation. And as for the &s;tatute, it affords not any pretext for &s;u&s;taining compen&s;ation a|gain&s;t an a&s;&s;ignee for a valuable con&s;ideration: it was made to recti|fy the common law, by be&s;towing the privilege of compen&s;ation as far as ju&s;t and equitable, that is between two per&s;ons who are mu|tually debtors and creditors to each other; but it never could be the intention of the legi&s;lature, in defiance of ju&s;tice, to make compen|&s;ation effectual again&s;t an a&s;&s;ignee who pays value. Nor mu&s;t it pa&s;s unob&s;erved, that, as our law &s;tands at pre&s;ent, this iniquitous effect given to compen&s;ation is &s;till more ab&s;urd, if po&s;&s;ible, than it was formerly. In our later practice an a&s;&s;ignment has changed its na|ture, and is converted into a proper <HI>ce&s;&s;io in jure,</HI> dive&s;ting the cedent <HI>funditus,</HI> and ve&s;ting the a&s;&s;ignee. Whence it follows, that, after an
<PB N="207" REF="216">
a&s;&s;ignment is intimated, compen&s;ation ought to be barred from the very nature of the a&s;&s;ignee's title, even laying a&s;ide the objection upon the head of equity. But we begun with &s;u&s;taining compen&s;ation a|gain&s;t an a&s;&s;ignee for a valuable con&s;ideration, in quality of a procu|rator; not adverting, that though his title did not protect him from compen&s;ation, his right as purcha&s;er ought to have had that effect: and by the force of cu&s;tom we have adhered to the &s;ame erroneous practice, even after our law is changed, when now the title of an a&s;|&s;ignee protects him from compen&s;ation, as well as the nature of his right when he pays value for it.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Inju&s;tice of common law with re&s;pect to inde&s;inite payment.</HEAD>
<P>NExt of oppre&s;&s;ion or wrong that may be committed by a debtor, under protection of common law.</P>
<P>Every man who has the admini&s;tration of his own affairs, may pay his debts in what order he plea&s;es, where his creditors inter|po&s;e not by legal execution. Nor will it make a difference, that &s;e|veral debts are due by him to the &s;ame creditor; for the rule of law is, That if full payment be offered of any particular debt, the credi|tor is bound to accept, and to grant a di&s;charge.</P>
<P>But now &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;um to be delivered by the debtor to the cre|ditor indefinitely, without applying it to any one debt in particular, the que&s;tion is, By what rule &s;hall the application be made, when the parties afterward come to &s;tate an account? If the debts be all of the &s;ame kind, it is of no importance to which of them the &s;um be applied: otherwi&s;e, if the debts be of different kinds, one for exam|ple bearing intere&s;t, one barren. The rule in the Roman law is, <HI>Quod electio e&s;t debitoris;</HI> a rule founded on the principles of common law. The &s;um delivered to the creditor, as afore&s;aid, cannot indeed be recalled, becau&s;e it was delivered to him in order for payment; but as there was no agreement about the application, it remains &s;till a &s;um belonging to the debtor; which con&s;equently intitles him to make the application. But though this is agreeable to the rule of common law, it is not agreeable to the rule of ju&s;tice; for if the debtor make an undue application, equity will interpo&s;e to relieve the creditor from the hard&s;hip. Equity indeed cannot force a man to give his money out of his own hand; and therefore, in giving it away, he may name what terms or conditions he thinks proper: up|on
<PB N="208" REF="217">
which account, though a debtor acts unju&s;tly in applying his mo|ney toward extinction of a debt bearing intere&s;t, when he is due to the &s;ame creditor a debt bearing none; yet a remedy in this ca&s;e is beyond the reach of equity. But where the money is already given away, and in the hand of the creditor, the debtor has no longer the &s;ame arbitrary power of making the application: equity will inter|po&s;e, and will direct the application. Thus indefinite payment comes under the power of a court of equity.</P>
<P>In order to a&s;certain the equitable rules for applying an indefinite payment, a few preliminary con&s;iderations may be proper. A loan of money is a mutual contract equally for the benefit of the lender and borrower: the debtor has the u&s;e of the money he borrows, and for it pays to the creditor a yearly premium. With re&s;pect therefore to a &s;um bearing intere&s;t, the debtor is not bound, either in &s;trict law or in equity, to pay the capital until the creditor make a de|mand. A debt not bearing intere&s;t is in a very different condition: the debtor has the whole benefit, and the creditor is deprived of the u&s;e of his money without a valuable con&s;ideration; which binds the debtor, in good con&s;cience, either to pay the &s;um, or to pay intere&s;t. Though this be a matter of duty, it cannot however be inforced by a court of equity in all ca&s;es; for it may be the creditor's intention to a&s;&s;i&s;t the debtor with the u&s;e of money without intere&s;t: but up|on the fir&s;t legal expre&s;&s;ion of the creditor's will to have his money, a court of equity ought to decree intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Another preliminary con&s;ideration is, that where a bond is grant|ed with a cautioner, the debtor is in con&s;cience bound to pay the &s;um at the term covenanted, in order to relieve his cautioner, who has no benefit by the tran&s;action. The ca&s;e is different where the cau|tioner &s;hews a willingne&s;s to continue his credit with the principal debtor.</P>
<P>We are now ripe for entering into particulars; and the fir&s;t ca&s;e I &s;hall mention is, where two debts are due by the &s;ame debtor to the &s;ame creditor, one of which only bears intere&s;t. An indefinite pay|ment ought undoubtedly to be applied to the debt not bearing inter|e&s;t, becau&s;e this debt ought in common ju&s;tice to be fir&s;t paid; and there is nothing to oblige the debtor to pay the other till it be de|manded. A man of candor will make the application in this man|ner; and were there occa&s;ion for a pre&s;umption, it will be pre&s;umed of every debtor that he intended &s;uch application. But the judge has no occa&s;ion to lay hold of a pre&s;umption: his authority for ma|king the application is derived from a principle of ju&s;tice. The &s;ame
<PB N="209" REF="218">
rule directs, that where both debts bear intere&s;t, the indefinite pay|ment ought fir&s;t to be applied for extingui&s;hing what is due of inter|e&s;t; and thereafter for extingui&s;hing one or other capital indiffe|rently, or for extingui&s;hing both in proportion <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The rule here laid down &s;eems to be unknown in England. Sometimes it is &s;ound that <HI>electio e&s;t debitorit,</HI> and &s;ometimes that it is <HI>creditoris; Abridg. ca&s;es in equity, cap.</HI> 22. <HI>&s;ect. D.</HI> &sect; 1. <HI>and</HI> 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;econd ca&s;e &s;hall be of two debts bearing intere&s;t; one of which only is &s;ecured by infeftment or inhibition. It is equal to the debtor which of the debts be fir&s;t paid: and therefore, the indefinite payment ought to be applied to the debt for which there is the &s;len|dere&s;t &s;ecurity; becau&s;e &s;uch application is for the intere&s;t of the cre|ditor. Take another ca&s;e of the &s;ame kind. A tenant in tail owes two debts to the &s;ame creditor; one of his own contracting, and one as repre&s;enting the entailer. Every indefinite payment he makes ought to be a&s;cribed to his proper debt, for payment of which there is no fund but the rents during his life. This, it is true, is again&s;t the intere&s;t of the &s;ub&s;titutes: but their intere&s;t cannot be regarded in the application of rents which belong not to them but to the te|nant in tail: and next, as they are <HI>certantes de lucro captando,</HI> their intere&s;t cannot weigh again&s;t that of a creditor who is <HI>certans de damno evitando.</HI></P>
<P>Third ca&s;e. A debtor obtains an ea&s;e, upon condition of paying at a day certain the tran&s;acted &s;um bearing intere&s;t: he is al&s;o bound to the &s;ame creditor in a &s;eparate debt not bearing intere&s;t. The que|&s;tion is, To which of the&s;e debts ought an indefinite payment to be applied? It is the intere&s;t of the debtor that it be applied to the tran&s;acted &s;um: it is the intere&s;t of the creditor that it be applied to the &s;eparate debt not bearing intere&s;t. The judge will not prefer the intere&s;t of either, but make the application in the mo&s;t equitable manner, regarding the intere&s;t of both: he will therefore, in the fir&s;t place, con&s;ider which of the two has the greate&s;t intere&s;t in the application; and he will &s;o apply the &s;um as to produce the greate&s;t effect. This con&s;ideration will probably lead him to make the application to the tran&s;acted &s;um; for if the tran&s;action be in a|ny degree lucrative, the debtor will lo&s;e more by its becoming inef|fectual, than the creditor will by wanting the interim u&s;e of the mo|ney due to him without intere&s;t. But then the benefit ought not to lie all on one &s;ide; and therefore equity rules, that the debtor, who gets the whole benefit of the application, ought to pay intere&s;t for the &s;e|parate &s;um; which brings matters to a perfect equality between
<PB N="210" REF="219">
them. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, if the application be made to the debt not bearing intere&s;t, the tran&s;action ought to be made effectual, not|with&s;tanding the term appointed for paying the tran&s;acted &s;um be e|lap&s;ed.</P>
<P>Fourth ca&s;e. Suppo&s;e the one debt is &s;ecured by adjudication, the legal of which is near expiring, and the other is a debt not bearing intere&s;t. And, to adju&s;t the ca&s;e to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, we &s;hall al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e, that the legal of an adjudication expires <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> without nece&s;&s;ity of a declarator. An indefinite payment here ought to be ap|plied for extingui&s;hing the adjudication. And, for the rea&s;on given in the preceding ca&s;e, the &s;eparate debt ought to bear intere&s;t from the time of the indefinite payment.</P>
<P>Fifth ca&s;e. An heir of entail owes two debts to the &s;ame creditor; the one a debt contracted by the entailer not bearing intere&s;t, the other a debt bearing intere&s;t contracted by the heir, which may found a declarator of forfeiture again&s;t him. An indefinite payment ought to be applied to the fir&s;t-mentioned debt, becau&s;e it bears not intere&s;t: for with regard to the heir's hazard of forfeiture, the forfeiture, which cannot be made effectual but by a proce&s;s of declarator, may be prevented by paying the debt. And the difficulty of procuring money for that purpo&s;e, is an event too di&s;tant and too uncertain to be regarded in forming a rule of equity.</P>
<P>Sixth ca&s;e. Neither of the debts bears intere&s;t; and one of them is guarded by a penal irritancy, feu-duties for example owing more than two years. In this ca&s;e the feu-duties ought to be extingui&s;hed by the indefinite payment; becau&s;e &s;uch application relieves the debtor from a declarator of irritancy, and is indifferent to the creditor as both debts are barren. Nor will it be regarded, that the creditor is cut out of the hope he had of acquiring the &s;ubject by the declarator of irritancy; becau&s;e in equity the rule holds without exception, <HI>Quod potior debet e&s;&s;e conditio ejus qui certat de damno evitando, quam ejus qui certat de lucro captando.</HI></P>
<P>Seventh ca&s;e. If there be a cautioner in one of the debts, and nei|ther debt bear intere&s;t, the indefinite payment ought undoubtedly to be applied for relieving the cautioner. Gratitude demands this from the principal debtor, for who&s;e &s;ervice &s;olely the cautioner gave his cre|dit. It may be more the intere&s;t of the creditor to have the applica|tion made to the other debt which is not &s;o well &s;ecured: but the debtor's connection with his cautioner is more intimate than with his creditor; and equity re&s;pects the more intimate connection as the foundation of a &s;tronger duty.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="220">
Eighth ca&s;e. Of the two debts, the one is barren, the other bears intere&s;t, and is &s;ecured by a cautioner. The indefinite payment ought to be applied to the debt that bears not intere&s;t. The delaying pay|ment of &s;uch a debt, where the creditor gets nothing for the u&s;e of his money, is a po&s;itive act of inju&s;tice. On the other hand, there is no po&s;itive damage to the cautioner, by delaying payment of the debt in which he &s;tands engaged. There is, it is true, a ri&s;k; but &s;eeing the cautioner makes no legal demand to be relieved, it may be pre&s;u|med that he willingly &s;ubmits to the ri&s;k.</P>
<P>Ninth ca&s;e. One of the debts is a tran&s;acted &s;um that mu&s;t be paid at a day certain, otherwi&s;e the tran&s;action to be void: or it is a &s;um which mu&s;t be paid without delay, to prevent an irritancy from taking place. The other is a bonded debt with a cautioner, bearing intere&s;t. The indefinite payment mu&s;t be applied to make the tran&s;action effec|tual, or to prevent the irritancy. For, as in the former ca&s;e, the in|tere&s;t of the creditor, being the more &s;ub&s;tantial, is preferred before that of the cautioner; &s;o, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the intere&s;t of the debtor is for the &s;ame rea&s;on preferred al&s;o before that of the cau|tioner.</P>
<P>Tenth ca&s;e. An indefinite payment made after in&s;olvency to a cre|ditor in two debts, the one with, the other without a cautioner, ought to be applied proportionally to both debts, whatever the na|ture or circum&s;tances of the debts may be: for here the creditor and cautioner being equally <HI>certantes de damno evitando,</HI> ought to bear the lo&s;s equally. It is true, the debtor is more bound to the cautioner who lent his credit for the debtor's benefit, than to the creditor who lent his money for his own benefit. But circum&s;tances of this na|ture cannot weigh again&s;t the more &s;ub&s;tantial intere&s;t of preventing lo&s;s and damage.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III. Inju&s;tice of common law with re&s;pect to rent levied indefinitely.</HEAD>
<P>BY the common law of this land, a creditor introduced into po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion upon a wad&s;et, or upon an a&s;&s;ignment to rents, mu&s;t apply the rent he levies toward payment of the debt which is the title of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e for that very purpo&s;e is the right granted. Rent again levied by execution, upon an adjudication for example, mu&s;t for the &s;ame rea&s;on be applied to the debt upon which the execution
<PB N="212" REF="221">
proceeds. Rent thus levied, whether by con&s;ent or by execution, cannot be applied by the creditor to any other debt however unexcep|tionable.</P>
<P>But this rule of common law may in &s;ome ca&s;es be rigorous and materially unju&s;t; to the debtor &s;ometimes, and &s;ometimes to the creditor. If a creditor in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by virtue of a mortgage or im|proper wad&s;et, purcha&s;e or &s;ucceed to an adjudication the legal of which is current, it is undoubtedly the debtor's intere&s;t that the rents be applied to the adjudication, in order to prevent expiry of the legal, rather than to the wad&s;et which contains no irritancy nor forfeiture upon failure of payment. On the other hand, if the creditor pur|cha&s;e or &s;ucceed to an infeftment of annualrent, upon which a great &s;um of intere&s;t happens to be due, it is beneficial to him that the rents be a&s;cribed for extinction of that intere&s;t, rather than for extinc|tion of the wad&s;et-&s;um which bears intere&s;t. The&s;e applications can|not be made, either of them, upon the principles of common law; and yet material ju&s;tice requires &s;uch application, which is fair and equitable, weighing all circum&s;tances. No man of candor in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of his debtor's land by a mortgage or improper wad&s;et, but mu&s;t be a&s;hamed to apply the rents he levies to the wad&s;et, when he has an adjudication the legal of which is ready to expire. And no debtor of candor but mu&s;t be a&s;hamed to extingui&s;h a debt bearing intere&s;t, rather than a debt equally unexceptionable that is barren.</P>
<P>Equity therefore &s;teps in to correct the oppre&s;&s;ion of common law in &s;uch ca&s;es; and it is lucky that this can be done by general rules, without hazard of making judges arbitrary. The&s;e rules are delinea|ted in the &s;ection immediately foregoing; and they all re&s;olve into a general principle, which is, <Q REND="inline">"That the judge ought to apply the rents &s;o as to be mo&s;t equal with re&s;pect to both parties, and &s;o as to prevent rigorous and hard con&s;equences on either &s;ide."</Q></P>
<P>But this remedy again&s;t the rigor of common law, ought not to be confined to real debts which intitle the creditor to po&s;&s;e&s;s. In particular ca&s;es, it may be more beneficial to the debtor or to the creditor, without hurting either, to apply the rents for payment even of a per&s;onal debt, than for payment of the debt which is the title of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. What if the per&s;onal debt be a bulky claim, that is re&s;tricted to a le&s;&s;er &s;um upon condition of payment being made at a day certain? It is the debtor's intere&s;t that the rents be applied to this debt in the fir&s;t place; as, on the other hand, it is the creditor's intere&s;t that they be applied to a per&s;onal debt which is barren. A court of equity, di&s;regarding the rigid principles of common law,
<PB N="213" REF="222">
and con&s;idering matters in the view of material ju&s;tice, rea&s;ons after the following manner. An adjudication is a title of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which, upon failure of payment, impowers the creditor to levy the debt out of the rents of his debtor's land: but if the creditor be already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, an adjudication is unnece&s;&s;ary: &s;uch a title, it is true, is requi&s;ite to complete the forms of the common law; but equity di&s;pen&s;es with the&s;e forms, when they &s;erve no end but to load the parties concerned with expence. And thus where the que&s;tion is with the debtor only, equity relieves the creditor in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion from the ceremony or &s;olemnity of leading an adjudication upon the &s;e|parate debts to which he has right. And no per&s;on can he&s;itate a moment about the equity of a rule, that is not le&s;s beneficial to the debtor by relieving him from the expence of legal execution, than to the creditor by relieving him from trouble and advance of money. Thus an executor in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is by equity relieved from the u&s;ele&s;s ceremony of taking a decree again&s;t him&s;elf for pay|ment of debt due to him by the decea&s;ed: and for that rea&s;on, an executor may pay him&s;elf at &s;hort-hand. In the &s;ame manner, a wad&s;etter in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his debtor's land, has no occa&s;ion to attach the rents by legal execution for payment of any &s;eparate debt due to him by the proprietor: his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by con&s;truction of equity, is held a good title; and by that con&s;truction the rents are held to be levied indefinitely; which makes way for the que&s;tion, To which of the debts they ought to be imputed. The &s;ame que&s;tion may occur where po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is attained by legal execution, without con&s;ent of the debtor. A creditor, for example, who enters into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by virtue of an adjudication, acquires or &s;ucceeds to per|&s;onal debts due by the &s;ame debtor: the&s;e, in every que&s;tion with the debtor him&s;elf, are ju&s;tly held to be titles of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to give oc|ca&s;ion for the que&s;tion, To what particular debt the rent &s;hould be imputed.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid &s;o much in general, the interpo&s;ition of equity to re|gulate the various ca&s;es that belong to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, cannot be attended with any degree of intricacy. The road is in a good mea|&s;ure paved by the labour be&s;towed in the preceding &s;ection; for the rules there laid down with regard to debts of all different kinds, may, with very little variation, be readily accommodated to the &s;ub|ject we are now handling. For the &s;ake, however, of illu&s;trating a &s;ubject that is almo&s;t totally overlooked by our authors, I &s;hall men|tion a few rules in general, the application of which to particular ca&s;es will be extreme ea&s;y. Let me only premi&s;e, what is hinted a|bove,
<PB N="214" REF="223">
that the creditor in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion can &s;tate no debts for exhau&s;ting the rents, but &s;uch as are unexceptionably due by the proprietor: for it would be again&s;t equity as well as again&s;t common law, that any man &s;hould be protected in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another's property, du|ring the very time the que&s;tion is depending, whether he be or be not really a creditor. Let &s;uch debts then be the only &s;ubject of our &s;pe|culation. And the fir&s;t rule of equity is, That the imputation be &s;o made, as to prevent on both hands irritancies and forfeitures. A &s;econd rule is, That, <HI>in pari ca&s;u,</HI> per&s;onal debts ought to be paid before tho&s;e which are &s;ecured by infeftment. And thirdly, with re&s;pect to both kinds, That &s;ums not bearing intere&s;t be extingui&s;hed before &s;ums bearing intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It is laid down above, that where the legal of an adjudication is in hazard of expiring, equity demands that the rents be wholly a&s;cri|bed to the adjudication. But it may happen in &s;ome in&s;tances to be more equitable, that the creditor be privileged to apply the rents to the bygone intere&s;t due upon his &s;eparate debts: and this privilege will be indulged him, provided he renounce the benefit of an expired legal.</P>
<P>The foregoing rules take place between the creditor and debtor. A fourth rule takes place among creditors. The creditor who attains po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by virtue of a preference decreed to him in a competition with co-creditors, cannot apply the rents to any debt but what is pre|ferable before tho&s;e debts which by the other creditors were produced in the proce&s;s of competition: for after u&s;ing his preferable right to exclude others, it would be unju&s;t to apply the rents to any debt which is not effectual again&s;t the creditors who are excluded. This would be taking an undue preference upon debts that have no title to a pre|ference.</P>
<P>It will be remarked, that hitherto I have had nothing in view but the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;ingle fund, and by what rules the rents of that fund &s;hall be applied when the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or hath claims of different kinds. But, with very little variation, the foregoing rules may be applied to the more involved ca&s;e of different funds. A creditor, for example, upon an entailed e&s;tate, has two debts in his per&s;on; one contracted by the entailer, upon which an adjudication is led again&s;t the en|tailed e&s;tate; another contracted by the tenant in tail, which can only affect the rents during his life. It is the intere&s;t of the &s;ub|&s;titutes, that the rents be imputed toward extinction of the entail|er's debt, becau&s;e they are not liable for the other. The intere&s;t of the creditor in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion upon his adjudication is directly oppo|&s;ite:
<PB N="215" REF="224">
it is his intere&s;t that the per&s;onal debt be fir&s;t paid, for which he has no &s;ecurity but the rents during his debtor's life. Here e|quity is clearly on the &s;ide of the creditor: he is <HI>certans de damno evitando,</HI> and the &s;ub&s;titutes <HI>de lucro captando.</HI> And this coincides with the &s;econd ca&s;e &s;tated in the foregoing &s;ection of indefinite pay|ment.</P>

<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. Where the common law is defective.</HEAD>
<P>IT is natural to believe, and it holds in fact, that the different execu|tions for payment of debt founded on common law, relate to tho&s;e ca&s;es only which the mo&s;t frequently occur in practice. Upon a debtor's failing to make payment, his land is attached by an appri|&s;ing, his moveables by poinding, and the debts due him by arre&s;t|ment and forthcoming. But experience di&s;covered many profitable &s;ubjects of a peculiar nature, that cannot be brought under any of the foregoing executions. And even with re&s;pect to common &s;ub|jects, &s;everal peculiar circum&s;tances were di&s;covered to which the exe|cutions mentioned are not applicable. A court of common law, which cannot in any article exceed the bounds of common law, has not power to &s;upply any of the&s;e defects. This power is re&s;erved to a court of equity acting upon a principle of ju&s;tice often above men|tioned, <HI>viz.</HI> That where-ever there is a right it ought to be made ef|fectual.</P>
<P>This &s;ection comprehends many articles. 1&s;t, Subjects that can|not be attached by the executions of common law. 2d, Circum|&s;tances where even common &s;ubjects are withdrawn from the&s;e exe|cutions.
<PB N="216" REF="225">
3d, The&s;e executions are in &s;ome ca&s;es imperfect. 4th, They &s;erve only to make debts effectual, and give no aid to other claims.</P>
<DIV5 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>ART. I.</HI> Subjects that cannot be attached by the executions of common law.</HEAD>
<P>THE common law is defective with re&s;pect to a variety of &s;ub|jects that cannot be attached by any of its executions; a rever&s;ion, for example, a bond &s;ecluding executors, a &s;um of money with which a di&s;po&s;ition of land is burdened, &amp;c. The&s;e are all carried by an adjudication invented by the &s;overeign court. They could not be carried by an appri&s;ing in the form of common law: nor can they be carried by an adjudication put in place of an appri&s;ing by the act 1672, which by the act it&s;elf is confined to land, and to what rights are properly acce&s;&s;ory to land, real &s;ervitudes, for example, and &s;uch like. But this is not all. There are many other rights and privi|leges, to attach which no execution is provided. A debtor has, for example, a well-founded claim for voiding a deed granted by him in his minority greatly to his hurt and le&s;ion: but he is bankrupt, and perver&s;ely declines a proce&s;s, becau&s;e the benefit mu&s;t accrue to his creditors: he will neither convey his privilege to them, nor in&s;i&s;t on it him&s;elf. A reduct&iacute;on on the head of deathbed is an example of the &s;ame kind. There are many others. If a man fail to purge an irritancy, the common law permits not his creditors to purge in his name; and they cannot in their own, unle&s;s the privilege be con|veyed to them. A court of equity &s;teps in to &s;upply the&s;e defects of common law; and, without nece&s;&s;ity either of a voluntary or judicial conveyance, intitles creditors at &s;hort-hand to avail them|&s;elves of &s;uch privileges. They are impowered to pro&s;ecute the &s;ame for their own advantage, in the &s;ame manner as if the debtor had done them ju&s;tice by making a conveyance in their favour.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ART. II.</HI> Circum&s;tances where even common &s;ubjects are withdrawn from the&s;e executions.</HEAD>
<P>I GIVE the following in&s;tances. Fir&s;t, The appri&s;ings of common law reach land only, of which the property is ve&s;ted in the debtor. The appri&s;ing a minute of &s;ale of land, and a di&s;po&s;ition without in|feftment, was introduced by the &s;overeign court.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="226">
Second, A is creditor to B, and B to C. The debt due by C to B is transferred to A by a decree of forthcoming upon an arre&s;tment laid in the hands of C. But what if before A proceed to execution C die, and no per&s;on is found who will repre&s;ent him? In this ca&s;e there is no place for an arre&s;tment; and yet A ought not to be di&s;ap|pointed of his payment. The court of &s;e&s;&s;ion mu&s;t &s;upply the defect, by adjudging to A the debt due by C to B.</P>
<P>Third, Execution for payment of debt proceeding upon authority of the judge, doing for the debtor what he him&s;elf ought to have done, &s;uppo&s;es always a <HI>mora</HI> on the debtor's part: and a judge therefore cannot warrantably authori&s;e &s;uch execution where there is no <HI>mora.</HI> This holds even in a proce&s;s for payment. Nor is there any foundation in equity, more than at common law, for a proce&s;s before the term of payment. Where the debtor is ready to fulfil his engagement at the term covenanted, and is guilty of no failure, ju|&s;tice will not &s;uffer him to be vexed with a proce&s;s. But with re&s;pect to an annuity, or any &s;um payable at different terms, if the debtor be once <HI>in mora</HI> to make a proce&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for payment of a part actually due, a decree may not only be pronounced for payment of that part, but al&s;o for what will afterward become due, &s;uper&s;eding execution till the debtor be <HI>in mora.</HI> Equity &s;upports this exten&s;ion of the com|mon law, which is beneficial to the creditor, by ea&s;ing him of trouble, and not le&s;s &s;o to the debtor, by preventing the co&s;ts that he would otherwi&s;e be &s;ubjected to in ca&s;e of future <HI>mora.</HI></P>
<P>From the&s;e principles it appears, that a proce&s;s for poinding the ground before the term of payment, ought not to be &s;u&s;tained, more than a proce&s;s again&s;t the debtor per&s;onally for payment. I ob&s;erve indeed, that a proce&s;s of mails and duties has been &s;u&s;tained after the legal term of Martinmas, though Candlemas be the cu&s;tomary term of payment <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, February 5. 1624, Wood contra Waddel.</NOTE>. But the rea&s;on of this &s;ingularity is, that originally Martinmas was the conventional term of corn-rent, and for that rea|&s;on was e&s;tabli&s;hed to be the legal term. It crept in by practice to delay payment till Candlemas, in order to give the tenant time to thre&s;h out his corns. And for &s;ome centuries this delay was e&s;teem|ed an indulgence only, not a matter of right. But, now that long cu&s;tom has become law, and that a tenant is under&s;tood not to be bound to pay his corn-rent before Candlemas, a court, whether of common law or of equity, will not readily &s;u&s;tain the proce&s;s before Candlemas.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="227">
A proce&s;s of forthcoming is in a different condition; for being held nece&s;&s;ary to complete the right of the arre&s;ter, it may in that view proceed before the term of payment of the debt arre&s;ted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, Feb. 21. 1624, Brown contra John&s;ton.

<P>There is one general exception to the foregoing rule, That if a debtor be <HI>vergens ad inopiam,</HI> execution may in equity proceed again&s;t him for &s;ecurity.

Chancery ca&s;es 121.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Fourth, In the common law of England there is one defect that gives acce&s;s to the mo&s;t glaring inju&s;tice. When a man dies, his real e&s;tate is withdrawn from his per&s;onal creditors, and his per&s;onal e&s;tate from his real creditors. The common law affords not to a per|&s;onal creditor execution again&s;t the land of his decea&s;ed debtor, nor to a real creditor execution again&s;t the moveables; and by this means a man may die in opulent circum&s;tances, and yet many of his credi|tors be forfeited. Whether the court of chancery interpo&s;es in this ca&s;e, I am uncertain. In the following ca&s;e it cannot, I am certain, fail to interpo&s;e; and that is where a debtor, having a near pro&s;pect of death, be&s;tows all his money on land, in order to di&s;appoint his per&s;onal creditors. The common law affords not a remedy, becau&s;e the purcha&s;ing land is a lawful act; and the common law looks not beyond the act it&s;elf. But the court of chancery is not &s;o circum&s;cri|bed. If the guilt appear from circum&s;tances, the court will relieve again&s;t the wrong, by decreeing &s;atisfaction to the per&s;onal creditors out of the real e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Fifth, The common law reacheth no man but while he continues within the bounds of its juri&s;diction. If a debtor therefore be in fo|reign parts, a judgement cannot pa&s;s again&s;t him, becau&s;e he cannot be cited to appear in court; and execution cannot be i&s;&s;ued again&s;t his effects without a judgement. This defect, which interrupts the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, is in Scotland remedied by a citation at the market|cro&s;s
<PB N="219" REF="228">
of Edinburgh, pier and &s;hore of Leith, introduced by the &s;ove|reign court, acting upon the foregoing principle, That where-ever there is a right, it ought to be made effectual. In England, a per&s;on abroad cannot be cited to appear even in the court of chancery. This court however affords a remedy. It will not warrant a citation a|gain&s;t any per&s;on who is not within the juri&s;diction of the court: but it will appoint notice to be given to the debtor; and if he appear not in his own defence, the court will out of his effects decree &s;atisfaction to the creditor. Thus, upon an affidavit that the defendant was gone into Holland to avoid the plaintiff's demand again&s;t him, and he ha|ving been arre&s;ted on an attachment, and a <HI>Cepi corpus</HI> returned by the &s;heriff, the court of chancery granted a &s;eque&s;tration of the real and per&s;onal e&s;tate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Vernon 344.</NOTE>. By virtue of the &s;ame power &s;upplying the defects of common law, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion gives authority to attach moveables in this country belonging to a foreigner, in order to con|vert them into money for payment of the creditor who applies for the attachment. Where a debtor, lurking &s;omewhere in Scotland, can|not be di&s;covered, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion makes no difficulty to order him to be cited at that head borough with which he appears to have the greate&s;t connection.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ART. III.</HI> The&s;e executions are in &s;ome ca&s;es imperfect.</HEAD>
<P>THE executions of common law, even where there is &s;ufficiency of effects, fall &s;ometimes &s;hort of the end propo&s;ed by them, <HI>viz.</HI> that of operating payment. I give for example the Engli&s;h writ <HI>Elegit,</HI> that which corre&s;ponds the neare&s;t to our adjudication. The chief differ|ence is, that an <HI>Elegit</HI> is a legal &s;ecurity only, and transfers not the property to the creditor. Hence it follows, that though the intere&s;t of the debt exceed the rent of the land, the creditor mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and hath no means by the common law to ob|tain payment of his capital, or in place of it to obtain the property of the land. But as in this ca&s;e the execution is obviou&s;ly imperfect, hurting the creditor without benefiting the debtor, the court of chan|cery will &s;upply the defect, by ordering the land to be &s;old for pay|ment of the debt.</P>

<P>BESIDE payment of debt, execution is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary for ma|king other claims effectual; and here al&s;o the common law is imperfect. To remedy this imperfection, adjudications in implement, declarato|ry adjudications, &amp;c. were in Scotland invented by the &s;overeign court. The following ca&s;e &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity of a declaratory adjudi|cation.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Munro, debtor to Andrew Drummond banker, a&s;&s;ign|ed to John Gordon, <Q REND="inline">"in tru&s;t, and for the u&s;e of the &s;aid Andrew Drummond,"</Q> certain &s;ubjects, and in particular an adjudication led by him again&s;t Mackenzie of Redca&s;tle's e&s;tate. After Gordon's death, Andrew Drummond, upon this adjudication, as his title, brought a proce&s;s of mails and duties again&s;t the tenants of Red|ca&s;tle. And the objection was, That the pur&s;uer having no convey|ance from Gordon, has no title to carry on this proce&s;s. The judges agreed upon the following propo&s;itions: 1&s;t, That the tru&s;t being gi|ven to John Gordon only, and not to his heirs, was at an end by his death; for there cannot be a tru&s;t without a tru&s;tee. 2d, That Sir Robert Munro being dive&s;ted by the tru&s;t-deed, the adjudication returns not to him by the death of the tru&s;tee. 3d, That though the per&s;on for whom the tru&s;t is created may in his own name in&s;i&s;t in every per&s;onal action flowing from the tru&s;t, yet none but the tru&s;tee can in&s;i&s;t in any real action founded on the adjudication; becau&s;e the tru&s;tee only is ve&s;ted in it. The&s;e points being &s;ettled, the diffi|culty was, to find out a legal method for e&s;tabli&s;hing the adjudication in the per&s;on of Andrew Drummond; and the judges came all into the following opinion, That Andrew Drummond's only method was, to rai&s;e a declaratory adjudication, calling all parties that may ap|pear to have intere&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> the repre&s;entatives of John Gordon and of Sir Robert, and concluding that the adjudication thus left <HI>in medio</HI> &s;hould be adjudged to him, in order to make effectual the purpo&s;es of the tru&s;t. This can be done by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion &s;upplying defects in common law. An action was competent to Andrew Drummond again&s;t John Gordon him&s;elf, to denude of the adjudication; and the declaratory adjudication comes in place of that action <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Andrew Drummond contra Mackenzie of Redca&s;tle, June 30. 1758.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The common law is defective with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who are <HI>in me|ditatione fugae</HI> in order to avoid payment of their debts; but a court

<HEAD>SECT. II. Where the common law with re&s;pect to execution is oppre&s;&s;ive or unju&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>EXecution for payment of debt is the operation of the judge or magi&s;trate, interpo&s;ing in behalf of a creditor to whom the debtor refu&s;es or neglects to do ju&s;tice. It is the duty of a debtor to convert his effects into money in order to pay his debts; and if he prove re|fractory or be negligent, it is the duty of the judge to interpo&s;e, and in his &s;tead to do what he him&s;elf ought to have done <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torical law-tracts, tract 12. at the beginning.</NOTE>. Hence it clearly appears, that the judge ought not to authori&s;e execution a|gain&s;t any &s;ubject which the debtor him&s;elf is not bound to &s;urren|der to his creditors, nor to &s;ell for their behoof. But a court of com|mon law, confined by general rules, regards no circum&s;tance but one &s;ingly, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether the &s;ubject belong to the debtor: if it be his property, execution i&s;&s;ues; and it is not con&s;idered whether the debtor can ju&s;tly apply this &s;ubject for payment of his debts. This in &s;ome ca&s;es may prove rigorous and unju&s;t. A man who by fraud or other illegal means has acquired the property of a &s;ubject, is not bound to convey that &s;ubject to his creditors: on the contrary, he is in con&s;cience bound to re&s;tore it to the per&s;on injured, in order to re|pair the wrong he has done. And in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the law ought not to interpo&s;e in behalf of the creditors, but in behalf of the per&s;on injured. A court of equity accordingly, correcting the inju&s;tice of common law, will refu&s;e its aid to the creditors; who ought not to
<PB N="222" REF="231">
demand from their debtor what in con&s;cience he ought to re&s;tore to another; and will give its aid to that other for recovering a &s;ubject of which he was unju&s;tly deprived.</P>
<P>Having thus given a general view of the &s;ubject, I proceed to par|ticulars; and &s;hall fir&s;t &s;tate a ca&s;e, where a merchant, in immediate pro&s;pect of bankruptcy, purcha&s;es goods and takes delivery, without any view of paying the price. This is a gro&s;s cheat in the mer|chant, which binds him in common ju&s;tice to re&s;tore the goods. A court of common law however, regardle&s;s of that circum&s;tance, will authori&s;e the bankrupt's creditors to attach the&s;e goods for their pay|ment, as being his property. This act of inju&s;tice ought to be re|dre&s;&s;ed by a court of equity: if the goods be claimed by the vender, the court of equity, barring execution by the creditors, will decree the goods to be re&s;tored to him. Thus, a reduction upon the head of the fraud mentioned, was &s;u&s;tained again&s;t the bankrupt's credi|tors arre&s;ting the &s;ubject purcha&s;ed in the hands of the per&s;on to whom it was delivered for behoof of the purcha&s;er <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, Fountainhall, December 22. 1680, Prince contra Callat.

<P>The &s;ame mu&s;t hold with re&s;pect to land, when purcha&s;ed fraudu|lently: when a creditor commences his adjudication, the vender will be admitted for his intere&s;t, and his objection will be &s;u&s;tained in e|quity, That the land ought not to be adjudged to the creditor, but to him the vender, in order to repair the wrong done him. I put another ca&s;e. In a proce&s;s of adjudication, a man who had purcha|&s;ed the land by a minute of &s;ale before the adjudication was com|menced, appears for his intere&s;t: ought he not to be preferred? His objection again&s;t the adjudger appears good in two re&s;pects: it would, in the fir&s;t place, be unju&s;t in the proprietor to grant to
<PB N="223" REF="232">
his creditor a &s;ecurity upon that &s;ubject; and it is therefore unju&s;t in the creditor to demand the &s;ecurity by legal execution: in the next place, it would be unju&s;t in the court to authori&s;e execution again&s;t a &s;ubject which the debtor is not bound to &s;urrender to his creditors, but, on the contrary, is &s;trictly bound to convey it in terms of the minute of &s;ale.</P>

The common law, regarding the words only, con&s;iders the obligation as belong|ing to the decea&s;ed factor: but equity takes under con&s;ideration the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, which prove that the obligation was in|tended to be taken <HI>factorio nomine,</HI> or ought to have been &s;o intend|ed; and that the factor's creditors are in equity barred from attach|ing a &s;ubject which he was bound to convey to his con&s;tituent.

This was acting as a court of common law. The property no doubt ve&s;ted in Makelwood, becau&s;e the goods were &s;old and delivered to her for her own behoof: but that circum&s;tance is far from being deci&s;ive in point of equity. The court ought to have con&s;idered, that though the transference of property be ruled by the will of the vender, yet that it depends on the will of the purcha&s;er whether to accept delivery for his own behoof or for behoof of another. Here it clearly appeared that Makelwood bought the goods for behoof of Boyl&s;toun, and that, in effect, &s;he was tru|&s;tee only in the &s;ubject: the legal right was indeed in her, but the equitable right clearly in Boyl&s;toun. The court ought to have con&s;i|dered further, that Makelwood having laid out Boyl&s;toun's money in purcha&s;ing the cloth, was bound in ju&s;tice to deliver it to Boyl&s;toun; and therefore that he in equity ought to have been preferred to her creditors, even though &s;he had been guilty of making the purcha&s;e for her own behoof.</P>
<P>Such is the relief that by a court of equity is afforded to the per&s;on who has the equitable claim, while matters are entire and the &s;ubject <HI>in medio.</HI> But now, &s;uppo&s;ing the execution to be completed, and the property to be transferred to the creditor ignorant of any claim again&s;t his debtor, as for example, by a poinding, or by an adjudi|cation with a decree declaring the legal to be expired, what &s;hall be the operation of equity in this ca&s;e? In an&s;wer to this que&s;tion, it will hold in general, without a &s;ingle exception, That a <HI>bona &s;ide</HI>
<PB N="225" REF="234">
purcha&s;er lies not open to a challenge in equity more than at common law; becau&s;e no man can be deprived of his property except by his con&s;ent or his crime.</P>
<P>I proceed to another branch of the &s;ubject. Execution both per|&s;onal and real for payment of debt is afforded by the law of all coun|tries: but execution intended again&s;t the refractory only; is &s;ometimes extended beyond the bounds of humanity; and equity is interpo&s;ed again&s;t rigorous creditors, where it can be done by &s;ome rule that is applicable to all ca&s;es of the kind. Two rules have been di&s;covered, which judges may &s;afely apply without hazard of becoming arbi|trary. The fir&s;t governs tho&s;e ca&s;es where there is &s;uch a peculiar connection between the debtor and creditor, as to make kindne&s;s or benevolence their reciprocal duty. In &s;uch ca&s;es, if the creditor car|ry his execution to extremity, and deprive the&punc;debtor of bread, he acts in contradiction to his po&s;itive duty, and a court of equity will interpo&s;e to prevent the wrong. The rule is, That a competency mu&s;t be left to the debtor to pre&s;erve him from indigence. Thus, in the Roman law, parents have <HI>beneficium competentiae</HI> again&s;t their children, and a patron again&s;t his client <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 17. De re judicata.</NOTE>. A man again&s;t his wife <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">&sect; 37. In&s;tit. de actionibus.</NOTE>. And the &s;ame obtains in an <HI>actio pro &s;ocio</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 16. De re judicata.</NOTE>. The rule was applied by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion to protect a father again&s;t his children, February 21. 1745, Bontein of Mildovan, where two former deci&s;ions on the other &s;ide were over-ruled. The common law, in affording execution a|gain&s;t a debtor, intends not to indulge the rigor of creditors acting in direct contradiction to their duty. But as in making laws it is im|practicable to fore&s;ee every limitation, the rule mu&s;t be made gene|ral, leaving to a court of equity to make exceptions in &s;ingular ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The other rule is more general, and &s;till more &s;afe in the applica|tion. Per&s;onal execution was contrived to force the debtor, by the terror and hard&s;hip of per&s;onal re&s;traint, to di&s;cover his effects, and to do ju&s;tice to his creditors. But if the <HI>&s;qualor carceris,</HI> a &s;pecies of torture, cannot draw a confe&s;&s;ion of concealed effects, the unhappy pri&s;oner mu&s;t be held innocent; and upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, per&s;onal re&s;traint is not le&s;s incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice than with humanity. Hence the foundation of the <HI>Ce&s;&s;io bonorum,</HI> by which the debtor, af|ter his innocence is proved by the trial of per&s;onal re&s;traint, recovers his liberty, upon conveying to his creditors all his effects. And in Scotland this action is known as far back as we have any written law.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX to Chap. VII.</HEAD>
<P>WHen a creditor leads an adjudication for a greater &s;um than is due, it is held that at common law the adjudication is totally void. The rea&s;on given is, That an adjudication, being an indivi&s;ible right, cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in part and fall in part. At the &s;ame time it is admit|ted, that where the <HI>pluris petitio</HI> is occa&s;ioned by an innocent error, without any <HI>mala fides</HI> in the creditor, the adjudication ought to be &s;upported as a &s;ecurity for what is ju&s;tly due, not only in accounting with the debtor, but even in a competition with co-creditors; and that in fact it receives this &s;upport from the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion acting as a court of equity. If this be the true foundation of the practice, it belongs to the pre&s;ent chapter; being an example of equity correcting the rigor of common law with re&s;pect to execution.</P>
<P>But that this practice cannot be founded on equity, appears to me clear from the following con&s;iderations. In the fir&s;t place, it is made evident above, that one <HI>certans de damno evitando</HI> may take advantage of an error committed by another, and that equity prohibits not &s;uch advantage to be taken, except where po&s;itive gain is made by it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 98. &amp; 174.</NOTE>. This rule is applicable to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. A creditor demanding his payment in a competition, is <HI>certans de damno evitando;</HI> and for that rea&s;on, he, in order to obtain preference, may lawfully avail him&s;elf of any error committed by a co-creditor; and therefore, to &s;upport a void adjudication again&s;t him, is not agreeable to any rule of equity. In the next place, an adjudication <HI>ex facie</HI> null, as proceeding with|out citing the debtor, is not &s;upported to any effect whatever either a|gain&s;t a competing creditor, or even again&s;t the debtor him&s;elf. Nor is there any &s;upport given to an adjudication again&s;t an apparent heir, when it proceeds without a &s;pecial charge, or when the lands are not &s;pecified in the &s;pecial charge. This leads me to reflect upon the dif|ference between intrin&s;ic objections, which render the adjudication void and null, and extrin&s;ic objections, which only tend to re&s;trict it. If the <HI>pluris petitio</HI> be an objection of the former &s;ort, the adjudica|tion, being void totally at common law, cannot be &s;upported in e|quity, more than an adjudication that proceeds without calling the debtor: if it be an objection of the latter &s;ort, there may po&s;&s;ibly be a foundation at common law for &s;upporting the adjudication in part, even again&s;t a competing creditor, though there be no foundation in equity. The important que&s;tion then is, To which cla&s;s this objec|tion belongs?</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="236">
Intrin&s;ic objections, generally &s;peaking, re&s;olve into an objection of want of power. A judge, unle&s;s the debtor be called into court, can|not adjudge his land to his creditor; and if he proceed without that &s;olemnity, he acts <HI>ultra vires,</HI> and the adjudication is void. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame, where an adjudication is led again&s;t an apparent heir, without charging him to enter to the e&s;tate of his ance&s;tor. To de|termine what mu&s;t be the effect of a <HI>pluris petitio,</HI> an adjudication &s;hall be con&s;idered in two lights; fir&s;t as a judicial &s;ale, and next as a <HI>pignus praetorium.</HI> If a man voluntarily give off land to his creditor for &s;atisfaction of L. 1000, under&s;tood at the time to be due, though the debt be really but L. 900, the &s;ale is not void; nor is it even void|able. The property is fairly transferred to the creditor, of which he cannot be forfeited when he is guilty of no fault; and all that re|mains is, that the <HI>quondam</HI> creditor, now proprietor, be bound to make good the difference. A judicial &s;ale of land for payment of debt, &s;tands preci&s;ely on the &s;ame footing: it cannot be voided upon account of a <HI>pluris petitio</HI> more than a voluntary &s;ale. I illu&s;trate this doctrine, by comparing an adjudication con&s;idered as a judicial &s;ale, with a poinding, which is really a judicial &s;ale. A man poinds his debt|or's moveables for payment of L. 100, and the poinding is completed by a transference of the&s;e moveables to the creditor, for &s;atisfaction of the debt. It is afterward di&s;covered that L. 90 only was due. Will this void the execution, and re&s;tore the goods to the debtor? No per&s;on ever dreamed that an innocent <HI>pluris petitio</HI> can have &s;uch effect with re&s;pect to a poinding. By the original form of this execution, the debtor's goods were expo&s;ed to public auction, and the price was delivered to the creditor in payment <HI>pro tanto:</HI> the purcha&s;er &s;urely could not be affected by any di&s;pute about the extent of the debt; and the re&s;ult mu&s;t be the &s;ame where the goods are adjudged to the creditor for want of a purcha&s;er. With regard to all legal effects he is held the purcha&s;er; and if it &s;hall be found that the execution has proceeded for a greater &s;um than was really due, this circum&s;tance will found a per&s;onal action to the <HI>quondam</HI> debtor, but by no means a <HI>rei vindicatio.</HI></P>
<P>But too much is &s;aid upon an adjudication con&s;idered as a judicial &s;ale; for during the legal at lea&s;t, it is undoubtedly not a judicial &s;ale, but a <HI>pignus praetorium</HI> only; and this I have had occa&s;ion to de|mon&s;trate above <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 194.</NOTE>. If a man &s;hall grant to his creditor real &s;ecurity for L. 1000, when in reality L. 900 is only due, will this <HI>pluris petitio</HI> void the infeftment? There is not the lea&s;t pretext for &s;uch a con&s;e|quence:
<PB N="228" REF="237">
the &s;um &s;ecured will indeed be re&s;tricted, but the &s;ecurity will &s;tand firm and un&s;haken. It will be evident at fir&s;t glance, that the &s;ame mu&s;t be the ca&s;e of an adjudication led innocently for a greater &s;um than is due: a <HI>pignus praetorium</HI> mu&s;t, with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent point, be preci&s;ely of the &s;ame nature with a voluntary pledge.</P>
<P>Hence it clearly appears, that the &s;u&s;taining an adjudication for what is truly due, notwith&s;tanding a <HI>pluris petitio,</HI> is not an operation of equity, to have place regularly in the pre&s;ent treati&s;e; but truly an operation of common law, which &s;u&s;tains not a <HI>pluris petitio</HI> to any other effect than to re&s;trict the &s;um &s;ecured to what is truly due, without impinging upon the &s;ecurity. Nor is this a vain di&s;pute; for be&s;ide re&s;ting the point upon its true foundation, which always tends to in&s;truction, it will be found to have con&s;iderable influence in practice. At pre&s;ent, an adjudication, where there is a <HI>pluris petitio,</HI> is never &s;upported again&s;t competing creditors farther than to be a &s;e|curity for the &s;ums due in equity, &s;triking off all penalties: and this practice is right, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch adjudication to be null at common law, and to be &s;upported by equity only. But if a <HI>pluris petitio</HI> have not the effect at common law to void the adjudication, but only to re&s;trict the &s;um &s;ecured, there is no place for &s;triking off the penalties, more than where there is no <HI>pluris petitio.</HI> Equity indeed interpo&s;es to re&s;trict penalties to the damage that the creditor can ju&s;tly claim by delay of payment; but this holds in all adjudications equally, not excepting tho&s;e that are free of all objections.</P>
<P>That it is lawful for one <HI>certans de damno evitando</HI> to take advantage of another's error, is an univer&s;al law of nature. That it has place in covenants is &s;hown in a former chapter: and that it &s;hould have place among creditors, is evidently agreeable to the rules of ju&s;tice, which dictates, that if there mu&s;t be a lo&s;s, it ought to re&s;t upon the creditor who hath been guilty of &s;ome error, rather than upon the creditor who hath avoided all error. When matters of law are taken in a train, and every ca&s;e is reduced to &s;ome principle, judges &s;eldom err. What occa&s;ions &s;o many erroneous judgments, is the being &s;way'd by particular circum&s;tances in every new ca&s;e, without ever thinking of recurring to principles or general rules. By this means we are extremely apt to go a&s;tray, carrying equity &s;ometimes too far, and &s;ometimes not far enough. Take the following remarkable in|&s;tance. Among the creditors of the York-building company, a num|ber of annuitants for life, infeft for their &s;ecurity, occupied the fir&s;t place; and next in order came the Duke of Norfolk, infeft for a very
<PB N="229" REF="238">
large &s;um. The&s;e annuities were frequently bought and &s;old; and the purcha&s;ers, in &s;ome in&s;tances, in&s;tead of demanding a conveyance of the original bonds &s;ecured by infeftment, returned the&s;e to the company, and took new per&s;onal bonds in their place, not imagi|ning that by this method the real &s;ecurity was unhinged. The&s;e new bonds being objected to by the Duke of Norfolk, as merely per|&s;onal, and incapable to compete with his infeftment, the court pro|nounced the following interlocutor: <Q REND="inline">"In re&s;pect that the Engli&s;h pur|cha&s;ers, ignorant of the laws of Scotland, had no intention to pa&s;s from their real &s;ecurity; and that the Duke of Norfolk, who had &s;uffered no prejudice by the error, ought not to take advantage of it; therefore find the &s;aid annuitants preferable as if they had ta|ken a&s;&s;ignments to the original bonds, in&s;tead of delivering them up to the company."</Q> This was &s;tretching equity beyond all bounds; and in effect judging that a creditor is barred by equity from taking advantage of any error committed by a co-creditor. Up|on a reclaiming petition accordingly the interlocutor was altered, and the Duke of Norfolk preferred <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Feb. 14. 1752, Duke of Norfolk contra Annuitants of the York-building company.</NOTE>.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Power of a court of equity to inflict puni&s;hment, and to mitigate it.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an inviolable rule in ju&s;tice as well as in expediency, That no man be allow'd to reap the fruits of his fraud, nor to take benefit by any wrong he has done. If, by the tortious act, another be hurt in his rights or privileges, there is ground for reparation at common law; which &s;ubject is handled in the beginning of this work: but wrong may be done without impinging upon any right or privilege of another; and &s;uch wrongs can only be redre&s;&s;ed in a court of equi|ty, by inflicting puni&s;hment in proportion to the offence. In &s;light offences it is &s;atisfied with forfeiting the wrong-doer of his gain: in gro&s;&s;er offences, it not only for&s;eits the gain, but &s;ometimes in&s;licts a penalty over and above. I begin with ca&s;es of the fir&s;t kind.</P>
<P>A man having two e&s;tates, &s;ettles them upon A and B, his two &s;ons; and A di&s;covering accidentally a defect in his father's title to the e&s;tate
<PB N="230" REF="239">
&s;ettled upon B, acquires a preferable title, and claims that e&s;tate from his brother. This palpable tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, not only of gratitude, but of filial affection, was never committed by any per&s;on with a quiet mind; and yet, upon the principles of common law, this odious man mu&s;t prevail. But a court of equity will interpo&s;e, and bar him from taking any benefit from this immoral act, by limiting his claim to the &s;um laid out upon the purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>If a gratuitous di&s;po&s;ition be granted with a provi&s;o that the di&s;po|nee &s;hall perform a certain fact, his acceptance of the di&s;po&s;ition &s;ub|jects him at common law to performance. But let us &s;uppo&s;e that a man makes a &s;ettlement of his e&s;tate, burdening his heir with a lega|cy to a certain per&s;on named; and that afterward, in a &s;eparate deed, he appoints that per&s;on to be tutor to his children. Here the legacy being given without any condition, is due at common law whether the legatee undertake the tutory or not. But every one mu&s;t be &s;en|&s;ible, that it is an act of ingratitude in the legatee to decline the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, and that he is in con&s;cience bound either to under|take the tutory or to &s;urrender the legacy. If, therefore, he be &s;o un|ju&s;t as to claim the legacy without undertaking the tru&s;t, a court of equity will puni&s;h him with the lo&s;s of his legacy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dirleton, 16th June 1675, Thom&s;on contra Ogilvie.</NOTE>. Many examples of the &s;ame kind are found in the Roman law. A <HI>libertus</HI> claiming a legacy left him by his patron, will be removed <HI>per&s;onali objectione,</HI> or <HI>exceptione doli,</HI> in the language of the Roman law, if he have been guilty of ingratitude to his patron; even where the act of ingratitude is otherwi&s;e laudable, as where after the death of the patron the <HI>liber|tus</HI> informed again&s;t him as a &s;muggler <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 1.

Again, a legatee who conceals a te&s;tament in order to di&s;appoint the effect of it, is for his ingratitude to the te&s;tator removed <HI>per&s;onali objectione</HI> from claim|ing his legacy <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 25.

<P><PB N="231" REF="240">
When a man is thus forfeited of a good claim, the que&s;tion is, What becomes of the &s;ubject claimed? whether doth it accrue to the fi&s;k, as <HI>bona vacantia,</HI> or is it left with the per&s;on again&s;t whom the claim is laid? Ulpian, in the text la&s;t cited, gives his opinion for the fi&s;k; thinking probably that the legacy becomes a &s;ubject with|out a proprietor; and that if no per&s;on can claim, it mu&s;t go to the fi&s;k. Paulus takes the other &s;ide: <Q REND="inline">"Amittere id quod te&s;tamento meruit, et eum, placuit, qui tutor datus excu&s;avit &s;e a tutela. Sed hoc legatum, quod tutori denegatur, non ad fi&s;cum transfertur, &s;ed filio relinquitur cujus utilitates de&s;ertae &s;unt <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 5. &sect; 2. De his quae ut indign.</NOTE>."</Q> And this &s;eems to be the more &s;olid opinion. The legatee is not guilty of any wrong with re&s;pect to the crown, but only with re&s;pect to the te&s;ta|tor and his heir. At the &s;ame time the legacy cannot be ranked <HI>inter bona vacantia;</HI> for the legatee continues proprietor, and is only bar|red from the u&s;e of his property by an exception competent to the heir, and to him alone, not again&s;t the legatee's right, but only to defend him&s;elf again&s;t payment. There is an additional rea&s;on for this defence again&s;t payment, which is, that the heir &s;hould have &s;ome compen&s;ation as a <HI>&s;olatium</HI> for that di&s;tre&s;s of mind he mu&s;t feel, when treated ill by tho&s;e who owed gratitude to his father or ance&s;tor. In our law accordingly the legacy is allowed to remain with the heir: equity forfeits the wrong-doer, and be&s;tows the lega|cy on the family that is burdened with it.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing both parties equally criminal, Ulpian's opinion up|on that &s;uppo&s;ition &s;eems to be well founded. I give for an example an obligation granted <HI>ob turpem cau&s;am,</HI> paid and di&s;charged. Here both parties are equally guilty; and hence the maxim in the Roman law&punc; <HI>Quod in turpi cau&s;a potior e&s;t conditio po&s;&s;identis;</HI> meaning that the obligee is barred <HI>per&s;onali objectione</HI> from demanding payment; and that if payment be made, the <HI>quondam</HI> obligor is equally barred from claiming re&s;titution. This maxim may hold between the parties; but not again&s;t the fi&s;k.</P>

I &s;ell my land to A by a minute of &s;ale. I &s;ell it a &s;econd time to B, who is fir&s;t infe&s;t. If B was ignorant of my bargain with A, his purcha&s;e will &s;tand good in equity as well as at common law; becau&s;e he made a lawful purcha&s;e, and had no intention to hurt A. But &s;uppo&s;ing B, when he made his purcha&s;e, to have been in the knowledge of my bargain

But it was a tortious act in B to receive from me what I could not lawfully give him; and he is pu|ni&s;hed for this tortious act by voiding his purcha&s;e.

But if &s;uch purcha&s;er be &s;ecure, it cannot be upon any principle in equity: for equity forfeits no man of his property unle&s;s he be guilty of &s;ome wrong; and though a <HI>bona fide</HI> purcha&s;e be an equitable title, the title of the true proprietor claiming his &s;ubject is not le&s;s &s;o.

That &s;uch was once the common law is certain, <HI>Hi&s;torical law-tracts, tract</HI> 3.; and, from the decrees above mentioned, it would appear, that the law of England continues the &s;ame to this day.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Next where a man purcha&s;es a &s;ubject which he knows to be at|tached by inchoated execution. The di&s;poning a &s;ubject thus legally attached is not &s;tellionate, becau&s;e it comes not under the definition of granting double rights. But the di&s;poner is guilty of a moral wrong, in attempting to di&s;appoint his creditor, by withdrawing the &s;ubject from his execution, to which wrong the purcha&s;er is acce&s;&s;ory if he had notice of the execution; and for that rea&s;on, though the purcha&s;er's title be fir&s;t completed, he will be po&s;tponed to the credi|tor in a court of equity, as a puni&s;hment upon him. Thus the por|teur of a bill of exchange, having indor&s;ed the &s;ame for ready money after it was attached by an arre&s;tment laid in the hands of the ac|cepter,
<PB N="233" REF="242">
the arre&s;ter was preferred to the onerous indor&s;ee, for the rea|&s;on above mentioned, that the latter when he took the indor&s;ation was in the knowledge of the arre&s;tment <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">June 1728, Competition between Logan and M^cCaul.</NOTE>. This opens the foundation of a propo&s;ition e&s;tabli&s;hed in practice, That inchoated execution renders the &s;ubject litigious. After an adjudication, for example, is commenced, it is wrong in the debtor to &s;ell the land; and it is wrong for any one to purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>We proceed to the ca&s;e of a creditor, who, for his &s;ecurity, takes a conveyance to a &s;ubject which he knows was formerly di&s;poned to another for a valuable con&s;ideration. What pleads for this creditor's preference, is the nece&s;&s;ity of providing for his &s;ecurity when he can|not otherwi&s;e obtain payment. But the debtor is undoubtedly crimi|nal in granting the &s;ecurity: he is guilty of &s;tellionate, and the cre|ditor is acce&s;&s;ory to the crime. This circum&s;tance ought to bar him in equity from taking the benefit of his real &s;ecurity again&s;t the for|mer di&s;ponee; for I hold it to be clear in principles, that the motive of preventing lo&s;s is in no ca&s;e a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for doing an unju&s;t act, or for being acce&s;&s;ory to it.</P>
<P>Such is the relief that by equity is afforded in favour of the equi|table claim again&s;t a purcha&s;e made <HI>mala fide.</HI> Let us now &s;uppo&s;e that a purcha&s;e is fairly made without notice, and that the property is transferred to the purcha&s;er. I put a &s;trong ca&s;e, that a man is guilty of &s;tellionate, by &s;elling his land a &s;econd time, and that the &s;econd purcha&s;er, ignorant of the other, obtains the fir&s;t infeftment. To make the que&s;tion of importance, let it al&s;o be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the price is paid by the fir&s;t purcha&s;er, and that the common author is now bankrupt. Some circum&s;tances at fir&s;t view &s;eem to weigh a|gain&s;t the &s;econd purcha&s;er: The common author is guilty of &s;tellio|nate; and though the &s;econd purcha&s;er is not acce&s;&s;ory to the crime, he takes however the benefit of an iniquitous deed; which may be reckoned not altogether fair. But upon mature reflection it will be found, that ju&s;tice militates not again&s;t him. By obtaining the fir&s;t in|feftment he becomes proprietor: and it only remains to be con&s;idered, whether there by any ground in equity or ju&s;tice to forfeit him of his property. Such forfeiture cannot otherwi&s;e be ju&s;t than as a puni&s;h|ment for a crime, and therefore it cannot be applied again&s;t the in|nocent. Hence an inviolable rule of ju&s;tice, That the innocent can|not be deprived of their property unle&s;s by their own con&s;ent. By this rule, the &s;econd purcha&s;er fir&s;t infeft is &s;ecure: he is &s;ecure by the common law, becau&s;e he has the fir&s;t infeftment; and he is
<PB N="234" REF="243">
&s;ecure by equity, becau&s;e, having purcha&s;ed <HI>bona fide,</HI> he is in|nocent.</P>
<P>A is tenant in tail, remainder to his brother B in tail. A not knowing of the entail, makes a &s;ettlement on his wife for life as a jointure, without levying a fine, or &s;uffering a recovery. B, who knew of the entail, ingro&s;&s;es this &s;ettlement, but does not mention any thing of the entail; becau&s;e, as he confe&s;&s;ed in his an&s;wer, if he had &s;poke of it, his brother, by a recovery, might have cut off the remainder, and barred him. B, after the brother's death, recovered an ejectment again&s;t the widow by force of the entail. She was re|lieved in chancery; and a perpetual injunction granted for this wrong done by B in concealing the entail; for if the entail had been di&s;clo|&s;ed, the &s;ettlement would have been made good by a recovery <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preced. chan. 35. Raw contra Potts.</NOTE>. The connection which B had with the parties, partly by blood, and part|ly by being employed to ingro&s;s the &s;ettlement, made it his duty to inform his brother of the entail. And his wilful tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of this duty was a moral wrong, which ju&s;tly deprived him of the benefit he projected to him&s;elf by concealing the entail.</P>
<P>In a ca&s;e that has &s;ome analogy to the foregoing, the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion, as a court of equity, &s;tretched their powers a great way further; further, I am per&s;uaded, than can be ju&s;tified.

One is prone to approve this judge|ment; and yet there appear un&s;urmountable difficulties.

<P>By the common law of England, the wife's adultery did not de|prive her of her dower, even though a divorce had followed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coke, 2 In&s;t. p. 435.</NOTE>.

<P>A penalty cannot be extended beyond the words; but it may be limited within the words upon circum&s;tances that infer innocence.

<HEAD>PART II. Powers of a court of equity to remedy the imperfection of common law with re&s;pect to matters of ju&s;tice that are not pecuniary.</HEAD>
<P>THE goods of fortune, &s;uch as admit an e&s;timation in money, are the great &s;ource of controver&s;y and debate among private per&s;ons. And, for that rea&s;on, when civil courts were in&s;tituted, it was not thought nece&s;&s;ary to extend their juri&s;diction beyond pecunia|ry matters: the improvement was indeed &s;o great as to be held alto|gether complete. But time unfolded many intere&s;ting articles that are not pecuniary. Some of them, making a figure, are di&s;tributed among certain courts: a claim of peerage, for example, is deter|mined in the Hou&s;e of Lords; of bearing arms, in the Lyon court; and of being put upon the roll of freeholders, in the court of Barons. Even after this di&s;tribution, there remain many rights e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, and wrongs committed again&s;t law, that are not pecuniary; which being left unappropriated, mu&s;t be determined in a court of equity: for the great principles &s;o often above mentioned, That where there is a right it ought to be made effectual, and where there is a
<PB N="238" REF="247">
wrong it ought to be repre&s;&s;ed, are equally applicable, whether the intere&s;t be pecuniary or not pecuniary.</P>
<P>To collect all the rights e&s;tabli&s;hed and wrongs committed that are not pecuniary, would be an endle&s;s labour: it would be u&s;e|le&s;s as well as endle&s;s; for the remedy is not at all intricate. The only que&s;tion of difficulty is, In what courts &s;uch matters are to be tried; and to this que&s;tion no general an&s;wer can be given, o|ther than that the chancery in England and &s;e&s;&s;ion in Scotland are the proper courts, where there is no peculiar court e&s;tabli&s;hed for determining the point in controver&s;y. I &s;hall therefore bring this &s;ubject within a narrow compa&s;s, by giving a few examples, which, for the rea&s;on now mentioned, mu&s;t be determined in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The qualifications of a man claiming to be a freeholder, mu&s;t be judged by the freeholders of the county, convened at their Michael|mas head-court: but the law has provided no remedy for a wrong that may be committed by the freeholders, <HI>viz.</HI> their forbearing to meet at the Michaelmas head-court, in order to prevent a man from applying to be put upon the roll; and therefore it is incumbent upon the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion to redre&s;s this wrong, by ordering the freeholders to meet under a penalty.</P>
<P>The next ca&s;e I &s;hall mention is of great importance, becau&s;e it comprehends an exten&s;ive field of law. It is, Whether and in what ca&s;es a covenant or promi&s;e for behoof of a per&s;on who is ab&s;ent, can be effectual, either to the contractor who exacts the obligation, or to the ab&s;ent party. I am aware that the intere&s;t which ari&s;es to the ab&s;ent from &s;uch a promi&s;e or covenant, being generally pecu|niary, ought in &s;trict form to have been handled above. But the intere&s;t of the per&s;on who exacts the obligation for behoof of the ab&s;ent, is not pecuniary; and the connection of the&s;e different inter|e&s;ts, ari&s;ing both from the &s;ame promi&s;e or covenant, makes it ne|ce&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be handled together.</P>
<P>In treating of this nice &s;ubject, I cannot hope to give &s;atisfaction to the reader, without fir&s;t explaining, more minutely than has hi|therto been nece&s;&s;ary, the nature of a promi&s;e and of a covenant; particularly how far they are binding in con&s;cience, and how far in law. Promi&s;es and covenants are provided by nature for obliging us to be u&s;eful to others, beyond the bounds of natural duty. They are perfected by a peculiar act of the will, termed <HI>con&s;ent,</HI> expre&s;&s;ed exter|nally by words or by apt &s;igns. And they are binding by the very
<PB N="239" REF="248">
con&s;titution of our nature, the moral &s;en&s;e dictating that every ra|tional promi&s;e ought to be performed.</P>
<P>No circum&s;tance &s;hows more con&s;picuou&s;ly our de&s;tination for &s;o|ciety, than the obligation we are laid under by our very nature to perform our promi&s;es and covenants. And to make our engagements the more exten&s;ively u&s;eful in the &s;ocial &s;tate, we find our&s;elves bound in con&s;cience, not only to tho&s;e with whom we contract, but al&s;o to others for who&s;e benefit the contract is made, however igno|rant of the favour intended them. If A exact from me a promi&s;e to pay L. 100 to B, I &s;tand bound in con&s;cience to perform my promi&s;e. It is true, that the promi&s;e being made to A, it is in his power to di&s;|charge the &s;ame; and therefore, if he be &s;ilent without requiring me to perform, my obligation is in the mean time &s;u&s;pended, wait|ing the re&s;ult of his will. But as A's death puts an end to his power of relieving me from my obligation, the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion is thereby remo|ved, and from that moment it becomes my indi&s;pen&s;able duty to pay the L. 100 to B.</P>
<P>The binding quality of a promi&s;e goes &s;till farther. If I promi&s;e A to educate his children after his death, or to build a monument for him, con&s;cience binds me al&s;o in this ca&s;e: which is wi&s;ely order|ed by the author of our nature; for a man dies in peace if he can rely upon the promi&s;es made to him of fulfilling his will after his death. And though my friend die without a &s;ingle heir to repre&s;ent him, I find my&s;elf, however, bound in con&s;cience to execute his will. Here then comes out a &s;ingular ca&s;e, an obligor without an obligee. And if it be demanded what compul&s;ion I am under to perform, when a court of law cannot interpo&s;e without an obligee to bring an action; the an&s;wer is, that I &s;tand bound in con&s;cience, as men were by a covenant before courts of law were in&s;tituted. Nor is this ca&s;e altogether neglected by law. It is extremely probable, that a court of equity would compel me to execute the will of my decea&s;ed friend, upon a complaint brought by any of his relations, though they could not &s;tate them&s;elves as obligees.</P>
<P>Such are the binding qualities of a promi&s;e, and of a covenant, by the law of our nature. We proceed to &s;how how far the&s;e qualities are &s;upported by municipal law.</P>
<P>For a long period after courts of law were in&s;tituted, covenants and promi&s;es were left upon con&s;cience, and were not inforc'd by any action. This in particular was the ca&s;e among our Saxon ance&s;tors: they did not give an action even upon buying and &s;elling, though the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary of all covenants. The Romans were more liberal;
<PB N="240" REF="249">
and yet they confined their actions to a few covenants that are nece&s;|&s;ary in commerce. At the &s;ame time, the action given to inforce the&s;e covenants was confined within the narrowe&s;t bounds. In the fir&s;t place, as only pecuniary intere&s;t was regarded, no action was gi|ven upon a covenant, unle&s;s the plaintiff could &s;how that it tended to his pecuniary intere&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 38. &sect; 17. De verborum oblig.</NOTE>. And accordingly an action was denied upon a contract to pay a &s;um of money to a third per&s;on. In the next place, though that per&s;on had a pecuniary intere&s;t to have the con|tract performed, yet action was not given him; becau&s;e, in the Ro|man law, no action was given upon a contract but to tho&s;e who were parties to it <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 11. De obligationibus et actionibus.</NOTE>. And hence the famous Roman law maxim, <HI>Quod alii per alium non acquiritur obligatio.</HI></P>
<P>But by confining the actions upon a covenant within &s;o narrow bounds, many moral rights and obligations are left un&s;upported by municipal law. The Roman law, in particular, is &s;ignally defective in denying &s;upport to any right but what terminates upon pecuniary intere&s;t. If I exact a promi&s;e in favour of a &s;tranger, action for per|formance is deny'd me, it being held that I am not intere&s;ted to have it performed. Is the ca&s;e the &s;ame where the promi&s;e is in favour of a friend, or of a di&s;tant relation? Perhaps it may. Let us then &s;up|po&s;e the promi&s;e to be made in favour of my benefactor, or of my child, perhaps my heir. Have not I to whom the promi&s;e was made, an intere&s;t to exact performance in this ca&s;e? No per&s;on of feeling can an&s;wer with confidence in the negative. Intricate que&s;tions of this kind lead to a general doctrine founded on human nature, That the accompli&s;hment of every hone&s;t purpo&s;e is a man's intere&s;t. And accordingly, in the affairs of this world, it is far from being uncom|mon to prefer the intere&s;t of ambition, of glory, of learning, of friend|&s;hip, to that of money. This doctrine, by refinement of manners, prevails now univer&s;ally. In the ca&s;e &s;tated, that I have an equitable intere&s;t to exact the promi&s;e in favour of my friend, is acknowled|ged; and a court of equity will accordingly afford me an action to compel performance.</P>
<P>But has my friend an action in ca&s;e I forbear to interpo&s;e? He has no action at common law, becau&s;e the promi&s;e was not made to him; and as little has he an action in equity during my life, for the following rea&s;on, that it depends on me to whom the promi&s;e was made, whether it &s;hall be performed or not. It is in my power to pa&s;s from or di&s;charge the promi&s;e made to me; and as this power conti|nues
<PB N="241" REF="250">
for life, the obligor cannot be bound to pay to my friend, while it remains uncertain whether it may not be my will to di&s;charge the obligation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 3. De &s;ervis exportandis. l. 1. C. Si mancipium ita fuerit alienat.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I illu&s;trate this doctrine by the following examples. I give to my &s;ervant money to be delivered to my friend as a gift, or to my credi|tor as payment. The money continues mine till delivery; and I have it in my choice to take it back, or to compel delivery. The friend or creditor has no action. He has not a real action, becau&s;e the pro|perty of the money is not transferred to him: he has not a per&s;onal action, while it continues in my power to recall the money. If deli|very be delay'd, he will not naturally think of any remedy other than of making his complaint to me. This rea&s;oning appears &s;o clear and &s;atisfactory, that I am forc'd to give up &s;ome deci&s;ions of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, teaching a very different doctrine. In a minute of &s;ale of land, the purcha&s;er was taken bound to pay the price to a cre|ditor of the vender's: action was &s;u&s;tained to this creditor for pay|ment to him of the price, though the vender interpo&s;ed, pleading, That the pur&s;uer not being a party to the minute of &s;ale, no right could ari&s;e to him from it, and therefore that the mandate or order he the vender gave to the purcha&s;er about payment of the price, might be recalled by him at his plea&s;ure <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, July 7. 1664, Ogilvie contra Ker. Durie, January 9. 1627, Supplicants contra Nimmo.</NOTE>. But the court afterward deter|mined more ju&s;tly in the following ca&s;es, founded on the &s;ame prin|ciple. A proprietor having re&s;igned his e&s;tate in favour of his &s;econd &s;on and his heirs-male, with a power of redemption to his elde&s;t &s;on, and the heirs-male of his body, did thereafter limit the power of re|demption, that it &s;hould not be exerted unle&s;s with the con&s;ent of certain per&s;ons named, and impowering tho&s;e per&s;ons to di&s;charge the rever&s;ion altogether if they thought proper, which accordingly they did after the father's death. In a declarator at the in&s;tance of the &s;e|cond &s;on to a&s;certain his right to the e&s;tate, it was objected by the el|de&s;t, That, by the &s;ettlement, he had a <HI>jus quae&s;itum,</HI> which could not be taken from him.

To return to the ca&s;e figured, of a promi&s;e exacted by me in fa|vour of an ab&s;ent per&s;on, my death mu&s;t make a total change, by gi|ving him an action which he had not during my life. For if the ob|ligor, who formerly was bound at my in&s;tance to perform his pro|mi&s;e, remain &s;till bound in con&s;cience, as is made evident above, it follows, that the per&s;on in who&s;e favour the promi&s;e was made, mu&s;t be intitled to demand performance. This will readily be yielded where the paction is for a valuable con&s;ideration: if A give a &s;um to B, for which B promi&s;es to A that he will build a hou&s;e to C, B cannot both retain the money and refu&s;e performance. But the &s;ame mu&s;t follow though the paction be gratuitous; for B is in con&s;cience bound to perform his promi&s;e, and if he be bound, C of cour&s;e mu&s;t be intitled to demand performance.</P>
<P>From the&s;e premi&s;es it follows, that the man who thus makes a contract for the benefit of an ab&s;ent per&s;on, may renounce his power of di&s;charging the contract; which renunciation delivered, will in&s;tantly intitle that per&s;on to demand performance.

<P>The foregoing doctrine unfolds the nature of <HI>fideicommi&s;&s;ary</HI> &s;ettle|ments
<PB N="243" REF="252">
among the Romans. Of the&s;e &s;ettlements Ju&s;tinian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">&sect; 1. In&s;tit. de fideicommi&s;&s; hered.</NOTE> gives a hi&s;tory which I do not comprehend, <HI>viz.</HI> That they were a con|trivance to elude the law, rendering certain per&s;ons incapable of ta|king benefit by a te&s;tament; that it being in vain to &s;ettle upon &s;uch a per&s;on an e&s;tate by te&s;tament, another per&s;on was named heir, to whom it was recommended to &s;ettle the e&s;tate as intended; and that Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar gave here a civil action to make the &s;ettle|ment effectual. But did Augu&s;tus make effectual a &s;ettlement execu|ted in defraud of the law? I can hardly be of that opinion. If the law was inexpedient, why not openly re&s;cind it? Augu&s;tus was too wi&s;e a prince to &s;et thus a public example of eluding law. Ju&s;tinian, I &s;u&s;pect, did not under&s;tand the nature of the&s;e &s;ettlements. It was a maxim in the Roman law, derived from the nature of property, That a man cannot name an heir to &s;ucceed to his heir <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See as to this point, Hi&s;torical law-tracts, tract 3.</NOTE>. Becau&s;e this could not be done directly, it was attempted indirectly by a <HI>fideicom|mi&s;&s;ary</HI> &s;ettlement: I name my heir regularly in my te&s;tament, and I order him to make a te&s;tament in favour of the per&s;on I incline &s;hould &s;ucceed him. Such &s;ettlements did at fir&s;t depend entirely on the faith of the heir in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, who upon that account was termed <HI>Heres fiduciarius:</HI> the per&s;on appointed to &s;ucceed him, termed <HI>Heres fideicommi&s;&s;arius,</HI> had not an action at common law to compel per|formance; for the fiduciary heir was not bound to him, but to the te&s;tator &s;olely. But here was a <HI>rei interventus,</HI> a &s;ubject in the hands of the fiduciary heir, which, by accepting the te&s;tament, he bound him&s;elf to &s;ettle upon the <HI>fideicommi&s;&s;ary</HI> heir; and he is therefore bound in con&s;cience to &s;ettle it accordingly. The <HI>fideicommi&s;&s;ary</HI> heir al&s;o has an equitable claim to the &s;ubject, founded on the will of the te&s;tator. The&s;e things con&s;idered, it appears to me plain, that Au|gu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, with re&s;pect to &s;uch &s;ettlements, did no more but &s;up|ply a defect in common law, by appointing an action to be &s;u&s;tained in equity to the <HI>fideicommi&s;&s;ary</HI> heir.</P>
<P>What is ju&s;t now &s;aid &s;erves to explain the nature of tru&s;ts, where a &s;ubject is ve&s;ted in a tru&s;tee for behoof of a third party, the chil|dren <HI>na&s;cituri</HI> of a marriage for example. A tru&s;t of this nature, ana|logous to a <HI>fideicommi&s;&s;ary</HI> &s;ettlement among the Romans, comes not un|der the cogni&s;ance of a court of common law; becau&s;e the per&s;on in who&s;e favour the tru&s;t is e&s;tabli&s;hed, not being a party to the agree|ment, has not at common law an action to oblige the tru&s;tee to fulfil
<PB N="244" REF="253">
his engagement: but he hath an action in equity as above mentioned. And hence it is, that in England &s;uch tru&s;ts mu&s;t be made effectual in the court of chancery.</P>
<P>Reviewing what is &s;aid above, I am in &s;ome pain about an ob|jection that will readily occur again&s;t it. A legatee, by the common law of the Romans, had an action again&s;t the heir for performance; and yet a legatee is not made a party in the te&s;tament; nor is the heir, by accepting the te&s;tament, bound to him, but to the te&s;tator &s;olely. In order to remove this objection, an account mu&s;t be given of the different kinds of legacies well known in the Roman law; and by putting this &s;ubject in its true light, the objection will vani&s;h. In the fir&s;t place, where a legacy is left of a <HI>corpus,</HI> the property is tran&s;|ferred to the legatee <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> upon the te&s;tator's death, conformable to a general rule in law, That &s;ubjects are transferred from the dead to the living without nece&s;&s;ity of delivery: for after the proprietor's death, there is no per&s;on who can make delivery; and if will alone, in this ca&s;e, have not the effect to transfer property, it never can be transferred from the dead to the living. Upon that account, a legatee of a <HI>corpus</HI> has no occa&s;ion to &s;ue the heir for delivery: he hath a <HI>rei vindicatio</HI> at common law. The next kind of legacy I &s;hall men|tion, is where a bond for a &s;um of money is bequeathed directly to Titius. The &s;ubject here, as in the former ca&s;e, ve&s;ts in the legatee <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> upon the te&s;tator's death. The legatee has no occa&s;ion for an action again&s;t the heir; for in quality of creditor he has at common law an action again&s;t the debtor for payment. A third &s;ort of legacy is, where the te&s;tator burdens his heir to pay a certain &s;um to Titius. This is the only &s;ort, re&s;embling a <HI>fideicommi&s;&s;ary</HI> &s;ettlement, to which the maxim can be applied <HI>Quod alii per alium non acquiritur obligatio.</HI> But as an action at common law for making other legacies effectual was familiar, the influence of connection, without making nice di&s;|tinctions, produced an action at common law for this &s;ort al&s;o. There|fore all that can be made of this in&s;tance, is to prove what will appear in many in&s;tances, that common law and equity are not &s;eparated by any accurate boundary.</P>
<P>Our entails upon the common law are, in &s;everal re&s;pects, &s;imilar to the Roman <HI>&s;ideicommi&s;&s;ary</HI> &s;ettlements; and &s;o far are governed by the principles above e&s;tabli&s;hed. I give the following in&s;tances. A man makes an entail in favour of his &s;on or other relation, di&s;|poning the e&s;tate to him, &s;ub&s;tituting a certain &s;eries of heirs, and re&s;erving his own liferent. The in&s;titute, though fettered with irritant and re&s;olutive clau&s;es, is however ve&s;ted in the full property
<PB N="245" REF="254">
of the e&s;tate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;torical law-tracts, tract 3. toward the clo&s;e.</NOTE>; and the &s;ub&s;titutes, for the rea&s;on above given, have not an action at common law to oblige the in&s;titute to make the entail effectual in their favour. But the in&s;titute re&s;embles pre|ci&s;ely a Roman <HI>heres &s;iduciarius,</HI> and is bound in equity to fulfil the will of the entailer, by permitting the &s;ub&s;titutes to &s;ucceed in their order.</P>
<P>I give a &s;econd in&s;tance, in order to clear up a celebrated que&s;tion often di&s;puted in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether an entail, &s;uch as that above mentioned, after being completed by infeftment, can be altered or di&s;charged even by the joint deed of the entailer and in&s;titute. Our lawyers have generally leaned to the negative. The in&s;titute, they urge, fettered by the entail, has not power to alter or di&s;charge; and the will of the entailer, who is not now proprietor, cannot avail. This rea&s;oning is a mere &s;ophi&s;m. The full property is ve&s;ted in every tenant in tail, not le&s;s than in him who inherits a fee-&s;imple. A tenant in tail is indeed limited as to the exerci&s;e of his powers of property: he mu&s;t not alien, and he mu&s;t not alter the or|der of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But the&s;e, and &s;uch like limitations, proceed not from defect of power <HI>qua proprietor,</HI> but from being bound per&s;onally, by acceptance of the entail, not to exerci&s;e the&s;e powers <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This doctrine is more fully explained in tract 3. above cited.</NOTE>. This di&s;tinction with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent que&s;tion is of moment. A man cannot exerci&s;e any power beyond the nature of his right: &s;uch an act is void; and every per&s;on is intitled to object to it. But no per|&s;on, other than the obligee, is intitled to object to the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a covenant or per&s;onal obligation. The entailer, in the ca&s;e &s;ta|ted, is the obligee: it is he who took the in&s;titute bound to limit as above the exerci&s;e of his property; and he therefore has it in his choice, to keep the heir bound, or to relea&s;e him from his obliga|tion. To be in a condition to grant &s;uch relea&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary indeed that he be obligee, but it is not nece&s;&s;ary that he be pro|prietor.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that the &s;ub&s;titutes have no title while the en|tailer is alive, to re&s;train the in&s;titute from the free u&s;e of his proper|ty. They have no claim per&s;onally again&s;t the in&s;titute, who &s;tands bound to the entailer, not to them: nor have they any other ground for an action, &s;eeing the full property of the e&s;tate is ve&s;ted in the in|&s;titute, and no part in them. In a word, it depends entirely upon the entailer, during his life, whether the entail &s;hall be effectual or
<PB N="246" REF="255">
not; and while that continues to be his privilege, the &s;ub&s;titutes evi|dently can have no claim. I go farther by a&s;&s;erting, that the entailer cannot deprive him&s;elf of this privilege, even though he &s;hould expre&s;s|ly renounce it in the deed of entail. The &s;ub&s;titutes are not made parties to the entail, and the renunciation, though in their favour, is not made to them. The renunciation is at be&s;t but a gratuitous pro|mi&s;e, which none are intitled to lay hold of but that very per&s;on to whom it is made.</P>
<P>A great change indeed is produced by the entailer's death. There now exi&s;ts no longer a per&s;on who can loo&s;e the fetters of the entail. The in&s;titute now mu&s;t for ever be bound by his own deed, re&s;train|ing him from the free exerci&s;e of his property; and as the &s;ub&s;titutes, by the entailer's will, have in their order an equitable claim to the e|&s;tate, a court of equity will make this claim effectual.</P>
<P>But here a que&s;tion may naturally ari&s;e, Why ought not the privi|lege which the entailer had to di&s;charge the fetters of the entail, de|&s;cend to his heirs? The &s;olid and &s;atisfactory an&s;wer is what follows. No right nor privilege de&s;cends to an heir but what is pecuniary, and tends to make him <HI>locupletior:</HI> but the privilege of di&s;charging the fetters of an entail makes not the heir <HI>locupletior,</HI> and therefore de|&s;cends not to him.</P>
<P>Similar to the rule above explained <HI>Quod alii per alium non acquiritur obligatio,</HI> is the following rule <HI>Quod alii per alium non acquiritur excep|tio.</HI> The&s;e rules being governed by the &s;ame principle, throw light up|on each other; and ought therefore to be handled together. I obtain from a man a promi&s;e to di&s;charge his debtor, the que&s;tion is, What &s;hall be the effect of that promi&s;e? The Roman lawyers an&s;wer, that I cannot have an action to compel performance, becau&s;e I have no intere&s;t that performance &s;hould be made; and that the debtor can|not have an action to compel performance, becau&s;e he was not a party to the agreement <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 17. &sect; 4. De pactis.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the Roman writers were certainly guilty of an over&s;ight in not di&s;tingui&s;hing here a <HI>pactum liberatorium</HI> from a <HI>pactum obligatorium.</HI> For admitting the latter to be limited as above by the common law of the Romans, it can be made evident from the principles of that very law, that the former cannot be &s;o limited, but that it mu&s;t be effectual to him for who&s;e behoof it is made, whether the per&s;on who ob|tained it be connected with him or not. The difference indeed with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent point between the&s;e pactions, ari&s;es not from a|ny
<PB N="247" REF="256">
difference in their nature, but from the nature of a court of law. Courts of law, as above mentioned, were originally circum&s;cribed within narrow bounds; and with re&s;pect to the Roman courts in par|ticular, many <HI>pacta obligatoria</HI> were left upon con&s;cience un&s;upported by the&s;e courts. Such a con&s;titution, indeed, confines courts within too narrow limits with re&s;pect to their power of doing good; but then it does not lead them to do any wrong. The ca&s;e is very different with re&s;pect to <HI>pacta liberatoria:</HI> it is unju&s;t in the creditor to demand payment after he has promi&s;ed, even gratuitou&s;ly, to di&s;charge the debt; and a court of law would be acce&s;&s;ory to this act of inju&s;tice, if it &s;u&s;tained action after &s;uch a promi&s;e. The court therefore mu&s;t refu&s;e to &s;u&s;tain action; or rather mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain the <HI>pactum liberatorium</HI> as a good exception to the action <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;torical law-tracts, tract 2.</NOTE>. And it makes no difference in this ca&s;e, whether the per&s;on who obtained the promi&s;e be dead or a|live. For while the promi&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, it mu&s;t bar the creditor from claiming payment, and mu&s;t bar every court from &s;upporting &s;uch claim. It is true, indeed, that while the per&s;on who obtained the promi&s;e is alive, it is in his power to di&s;charge the promi&s;e, and con|&s;equently to intitle the creditor to an action. But till that di&s;charge be obtained, it would be unju&s;t in any court to &s;u&s;tain action.</P>
<P>Some of the Roman writers, &s;en&s;ible that an action for payment ought not to be &s;u&s;tained to a creditor who has pa&s;&s;ed from his debt, endeavour to make this opinion con&s;i&s;tent with the rule <HI>Quod alii per alium non acquiritur exceptio,</HI> by a &s;ubtilty that goes out of &s;ight. They in&s;i&s;t, that the debtor cannot found a defence upon a paction to which he was not a party: but they yield, that the paction, though not effectual to the debtro, is effectual again&s;t the creditor; and they make it effectual again&s;t him, by &s;u&s;taining to the debtor an <HI>exceptio doli</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 25. &sect; 2. l. 26. De pactis. l. 26. &sect; 4. De pactis dotalibus.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ame principle, if a third per&s;on who is not bound, pay a debt, and take a di&s;charge in name of the debtor, the debtor, though the di&s;charge be not delivered to him, can defend him&s;elf by an <HI>exceptio doli</HI> again&s;t the creditor demanding payment from him. For the creditor who has received payment from the third per&s;on, can|not in con&s;cience demand a &s;econd payment from the debtor. But though he be barred from demanding a &s;econd payment, it does not follow that the debt is extingui&s;hed. That it remains a &s;ub&s;i&s;ting debt will appear from con&s;idering, 1<HI>mo,</HI> That the tran&s;action be|tween the creditor and the third per&s;on may be di&s;&s;olved as it was e|&s;tabli&s;hed,
<PB N="248" REF="257">
<HI>viz.</HI> by mutual con&s;ent, and by cancelling the di&s;charge. 2<HI>do,</HI> The debtor, notwith&s;tanding the erroneous payment, has it in his power to force a di&s;charge from the creditor upon offering him payment: neither of which could happen, were the debt extin|gui&s;hed.</P>
<P>It only remains to be ob&s;erved upon this head, that, when a debt is thus paid by a third per&s;on, it is in the debtor's choice to refund the money to the third per&s;on, or to pay it to the creditor. But if he chu&s;e to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the creditor by an <HI>exceptio doli,</HI> which imports his ratification of the payment, the &s;u&s;taining this exception hath two effects: 1&s;t, It operates to him a legal extinc|tion of the debt; and, next, It intitles the third per&s;on to demand the &s;um from him.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Powers of a court of equity founded on the prin|ciple of utility.</HEAD>
<P>JUSTICE is concerned in two things equally capital; one to make right effectual, and one to redre&s;s wrong. With re&s;pect to the former, utility coincides with ju&s;tice: with re&s;pect to the latter, utility goes farther than ju&s;tice. Wrong mu&s;t be done before ju&s;tice can interpo&s;e; but utility, having a more exten&s;ive view, lays down mea&s;ures that are preventive of wrong. With re&s;pect to mea|&s;ures for the po&s;itive good of &s;ociety, and for making men &s;till more happy in a &s;ocial &s;tate, the&s;e are re&s;erved to the legi&s;lature <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">And to interpo&s;e for advancing the po&s;itive good of but one or a few individuals, is &s;till farther beyond the powers of a court of equity; though the court of chancery has &s;ometimes ventured to exert it&s;elf for this narrow purpo&s;e, actuated by a laudable zeal to do good, carried indeed beyond proper bounds. I give the following in&s;tance. Eighteen tenants of a manor have right to a common, and fifteen of them agree to inclo&s;e. The inclo&s;ing will be decreed though oppo&s;ed by three: for it &s;hall not be in the power of a few wilful per&s;ons to oppo&s;e a public good; <HI>Abridg. ca&s;es in equity, cap.</HI> 4. <HI>&s;ect.

I re&s;erve the la&s;t place for the power of a court of equity to &s;upply defects in &s;tatutes preventive of harm, whether that harm be of more or le&s;s import|ance: it is proper that matters &s;o much connected &s;hould be handled together.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Acts</HI> contra bonos mores <HI>repre&s;&s;ed.</HI></HEAD>
<P>INDIVIDUALS in &s;ociety are linked together by many different rela|tions, that require each of them a &s;uitable behaviour or conduct; and that we &s;hould act according to the relations in which we are en|gaged, appears not only proper, but, by the moral &s;en&s;e, is made our duty. The relations in particular that imply &s;ubordination, make the corner-&s;tone of government, and ripen men gradually for beha|ving properly in it. The reciprocal duties that ari&s;e from the re|lations of parent and child, of preceptor and &s;cholar, of ma&s;ter and &s;ervant, of the high and low, of the rich and poor, &amp;c. pave the way to others that follow, and inure us to the duties both of rulers and of &s;ubjects. It is for this rea&s;on extremely material, that the reciprocal duties ari&s;ing from &s;ubordination be pre&s;erved from incroaching up|on each other: to rever&s;e them would rever&s;e the order of nature, and would tend to the di&s;&s;olution of government. To &s;uffer, for example, a young man to u&s;urp upon his father, and to a&s;&s;ume rule over him, has not only the bad tendency now mentioned, but is directly immo|ral, and a breach of duty. A wrong, however, of this nature not be|ing pecuniary, comes not under the juri&s;diction of courts of common law, and therefore mu&s;t be repre&s;&s;ed by a court of equity. It might, as a wrong not pecuniary, have found a place in the foregoing book; but as it makes a greater figure by its poi&s;onous and undermining con&s;equences, I cho&s;e it as proper for the front of the pre&s;ent book.</P>
<P>A young man in his contract of marriage having con&s;ented to be put under interdiction to his father and father-in-law, and to the elde&s;t &s;on of the marriage in ca&s;e of their failure; and the two fir&s;t being dead, the court refu&s;ed to &s;u&s;tain an interdiction where the fa|ther was to be interdicted, and the &s;on interdictor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, January 18. 1622, Silvertonhill contra his Father.</NOTE>.

Other deeds tending to or ari&s;ing from depravation of manners, are al&s;o rejected by a court of equity.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Acts and covenants in them&s;elves innocent, prohibited in equity, becau&s;e of their tendency to hurt &s;ociety.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;pirit of mutiny &s;hewed it&s;elf &s;ome time ago among the workmen in the city of London, and ro&s;e to &s;uch a height as to require the interpo&s;ition of the legi&s;lature. The &s;ame &s;pirit broke
<PB N="252" REF="261">
out afterward among the journeymen-tailors of Edinburgh, who erected them&s;elves into a club or &s;ociety, keeping in particular a li&s;t of the journeymen out of &s;ervice, under pretext of accommodating the ma&s;ters more ea&s;ily with workmen, but in reality to enable them|&s;elves to get new ma&s;ters if they differed with tho&s;e they &s;erved. When any of them de&s;erted their &s;ervice, they entered their names in that li&s;t, and were immediately again employed, as other ma&s;ters were under a nece&s;&s;ity to take them or to give up their bu&s;ine&s;s. The ma&s;ter-tailors &s;uffered many inconveniencies from this combination, which among other hard&s;hips produced increa&s;e of wages from time to time. The journeymen, for &s;aving time, had always breakfa&s;ted in the hou&s;es of their ma&s;ter; but upon a concert among them, they all of them de&s;erted their work about nine in the morning, de|claring their re&s;olution to have the hour between nine and ten to them&s;elves in all time coming. This de&s;ertion was the more di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing, as it was made when the preparing &s;ome cloathing for the army required the utmo&s;t di&s;patch. This occa&s;ioned a complaint to the Bailies of Edinburgh; who found, <Q REND="inline">"That the defenders, and other journeymen-tailors of Edinburgh, are not intitled to an hour of rece&s;s for breakfa&s;t; that the wages of a journeyman-tailor in the &s;aid city ought not to exceed one &s;hilling <HI>per</HI> day; and that if any journeyman-tailor, not retained or employed, &s;hall refu&s;e to work when required by a ma&s;ter on the fore&s;aid terms, unle&s;s for &s;ome &s;ufficient cau&s;e to be allowed by the magi&s;trates, the offender &s;hall upon conviction be puni&s;hed in terms of law."</Q></P>
<P>This cau&s;e being brought to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion by advocation, it was thought of &s;ufficient importance for a hearing in pre&s;ence; and the re&s;ult was, to approve of the regulations of the magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>The only difficulty was, whether the fore&s;aid regulations did not incroach upon the liberty of the &s;ubject. It was admitted that they did in &s;ome mea&s;ure; but then the court was &s;atisfied of their ne|ce&s;&s;ity from the following con&s;iderations. Arts and manufactures are of two kinds. Tho&s;e for luxury and for amu&s;ement are &s;ubject|ed to no rules, becau&s;e a &s;ociety may &s;ub&s;i&s;t comfortably without them. But tho&s;e which are nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being of &s;ociety mu&s;t be &s;ubjected to rules; otherwi&s;e it may be in the power of a few individuals to do much mi&s;chief. If the bakers &s;hould refu&s;e to make bread, or the brewers to make ale, or the colliers to provide coals, without being &s;ubjected to any control, they would be ma|&s;ters of the lives of the inhabitants. To remedy &s;uch an evil, which is of the fir&s;t magnitude, there mu&s;t be a power placed &s;ome|where;
<PB N="253" REF="262">
where; and accordingly this power has been long exerci&s;ed by magi|&s;trates of boroughs and ju&s;tices of peace, under review of the &s;ove|reign court. The tailors, by forbearing to work, cannot do mi&s;|chief &s;o &s;uddenly; but people mu&s;t be clad; and if there be no re|medy again&s;t the ob&s;tinacy of the tailors, they may compel people to &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t exorbitant terms.</P>
<P>Another point debated was the propriety of the foregoing regu|lations. Upon which it was ob&s;erved, that the regulation of the wages is even admitted by the defenders them&s;elves to be proper, becau&s;e they have acquie&s;ced in it without complaint. And yet if this article be admitted, the other regulations follow of nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence; for it is to no purpo&s;e to fix wages without al&s;o fixing the number of working hours; and it is to no purpo&s;e to fix either, if the defenders have the privilege to work or not at their plea&s;ure. Their demand of a rece&s;s between nine and ten, which they chiefly in&s;i&s;t for, is extremely inconvenient, becau&s;e of the time it con|&s;umes, e&s;pecially in a wet day, when they mu&s;t &s;hift and dry them|&s;elves to avoid &s;ullying the new work they have on hand. And as for health, they will never be denied, either by their ma&s;ters or by the judge, a whole day at times for exerci&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tailors of Edinburgh contra their journeymen, December 10. 1762.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The journeymen-woolcombers in Aberdeen did in the year 1755 form them&s;elves into a &s;ociety, exacting entry-money, inflicting pe|nalties, &amp;c. to be under the management of &s;tewards, cho&s;en every month: and though their &s;eeming view was to provide for their poor, yet under that pretext &s;everal regulations were made, cramp|ing trade, and tending to make them independent of their employ|ers. A complaint again&s;t the &s;ociety, by the procurator-fi&s;cal of the bailie-court of Aberdeen, being removed to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion by advocation, the following interlocutor was pronounced: <Q REND="inline">"The Lords, having con&s;idered the plan upon which the &s;ociety of woolcombers is erected, the regulations at fir&s;t enacted, though afterward abrogated, and the rules &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, find, That &s;uch combina|tions of artificers, whereby they collect money for a common box, inflict penalties, impo&s;e oaths, and make other by-laws, are of dangerous tendency, &s;ubver&s;ive of peace and order, and again&s;t law: therefore they prohibit and di&s;charge the defenders, the woolcombers, to continue to act under &s;uch combination or &s;ocie|ty for the future, or to enter into any &s;uchlike new &s;ociety or combination, as they &s;hall be an&s;werable: but allow them, at the &s;ight of the magi&s;trates of Aberdeen, to apply the money already

<P>SOCIETY cannot flouri&s;h by pecuniary commerce merely: laying a&s;ide benevolence, the &s;ocial &s;tate would neither be commodious nor comfortable. There are &s;everal connections formed chiefly by con&s;ent, that are in their nature and intendment altogether di&s;intere&s;t|ed; witne&s;s the connection between a guardian and his infant, and in general between a tru&s;tee and the per&s;on for who&s;e behoof the tru&s;t is gratuitou&s;ly undertaken. In this ca&s;e, to take a premium for executing any article of the tru&s;t, may &s;ometimes be extortion, of which in the former book; and being in every ca&s;e incon&s;i&s;tent with the tru&s;tee's duty, will be di&s;countenanced even at common law. Thus a bond for 500 merks granted to an interdictor by one who pur|cha&s;ed land from the per&s;on interdicted, was voided <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haddington, penult July 1622, Carnou&s;ie contra Achanachie.</NOTE>. If the &s;ale was a rational mea&s;ure, it was the interdictor's duty to con&s;ent to it without a bribe: if the &s;ale was hurtful to the per&s;on interdicted, the interdictor's taking a &s;um for his con&s;ent was taking a bribe to betray his tru&s;t.</P>
<P>But equity goes farther, and prohibits a tru&s;tee from making any profit by his management directly or indirectly. However inno|cent an act of this nature may be in it&s;elf, it is poi&s;onous with re|gard to its con&s;equences; for if any opportunity be given for making profit in this manner, a tru&s;tee will lo&s;e &s;ight of his duty, and &s;oon learn to direct his management chiefly or &s;olely for his own profit. It is &s;olely upon this foundation that a tutor is barred from making profit, by purcha&s;ing debts due by his pupil, or rights affecting his e&s;tate. The &s;ame hazard of mi&s;chief concludes al&s;o again&s;t a tru&s;tee who hath a &s;alary, or is paid for his labour. A <HI>pactum de quota litis</HI> be|tween an advocate and his client, which tends to corrupt the morals of the former, and to make him &s;werve from his duty, is di&s;couraged in all civilized countries. A bargain of this kind may be fair, and even beneficial to the client: but if indulged in any in&s;tance, it mu&s;t be indulged without re&s;erve; and therefore utility requires that it be

Suppo&s;ing parties once in court upon any particular affair, the adju&s;ting, without a new proce&s;s, all matters between them that can at pre&s;ent be adju&s;ted, is undoubtedly beneficial, becau&s;e it tends to abridge law-&s;uits. This valuable end is attained, by be&s;towing on the defendant a privilege to with-hold performance from the pur&s;uer, till the pur&s;uer <HI>&s;imul et &s;emel</HI> perform to him. This privilege is exerci&s;ed by pleading it as an ex|ception to the pur&s;uer's demand; and the exception, from its nature, is termed <HI>Retention.</HI></P>
<P>Compen&s;ation, as we have &s;een, is founded on the principle of e|quity. And it is al&s;o &s;upported by that of utility; becau&s;e the fini&s;h|ing two counter-claims in the &s;ame proce&s;s tends to le&s;&s;en the number of law-&s;uits. Retention, again, is founded &s;olely on utility, being calculated for no other end but to prevent the multiplication of law-&s;uits. The expedience of retention in this re&s;pect, has gained it ad|mittance in all civilized nations. In the Engli&s;h court of chancery particularly, it is a well-known exception, of which I give the follow|ing in&s;tance. <Q REND="inline">"If the plaintiff mortgage his e&s;tate to the defendant, and afterward borrow money from the defendant upon bond, the redemption ought not to take place unle&s;s the bonded debt be paid as well as the mortgage-money <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Vernon 244.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>From what is &s;aid, every &s;ort of obligation affords, as it would appear, a ground for retention, provided the term of performance be come, and no ju&s;t cau&s;e for with-holding performance. It &s;hall only be added, that for the rea&s;ons given with re&s;pect to compen&s;ation <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 201.</NOTE>, retention cannot be pleaded again&s;t an a&s;&s;ignee for a valuable con&s;i|deration.</P>
<P>A directed B to pay to C what &s;ums C &s;hould want. C according|ly received two &s;ums (among others) from B, for which he gave re|ceipts as by the order of A. A and C came to account, which being &s;tated, they gave mutual relea&s;es. But the two &s;ums not being en|tered in the books of A, were not accounted for by C. B not having received any allowance from A for the two &s;ums, prefers his bill a|gain&s;t C to have the money returned to him. C confe&s;&s;ed the receipts, but in&s;i&s;ted, that the money was delivered to him by the order of A, and that B being a hand only had no claim. But the court decreed,
<PB N="258" REF="267">
That the plaintiff had a fair claim again&s;t the defendant to avoid cir|cuity of &s;uits: for otherwi&s;e it would turn the plaintiff on A, and A again on the defendant in equity to &s;et a&s;ide the relea&s;e, and to have an allowance of the&s;e &s;ums. And the decree was affirmed in the Hou&s;e of Lords <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shower's ca&s;es in parliament, 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By the common law of this land, a creditor introduced into po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion upon a wad&s;et, upon an a&s;&s;ignment to rents, or upon an adjudi|cation, is bound to &s;urrender the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as &s;oon as the debt is paid by the rents levied. He obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for a certain purpo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> to levy the rents for his payment; and therefore, when that pur|po&s;e is fulfilled, his right is at an end, and he is not any longer in|titled to po&s;&s;e&s;s. He perhaps is creditor in other debts that may in|title him to apprehend po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion <HI>de novo:</HI> but the&s;e will not, at com|mon law, impower him to detain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion one moment after the debt that was the title of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is paid. He mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;urren|der po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and, if he think proper, he may thereafter apply for legal authority to enter again into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for payment of the&s;e &s;e|parate debts. A court of equity views matters in a different light. The debtor's claim to have his land re&s;tored to him is certainly not founded on utility, when &s;uch claim can &s;erve no other end but to multiply expence, by forcing the creditor to take out execution upon the &s;eparate debt, in order to be repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. A maxim in the Roman law concludes in this ca&s;e with its utmo&s;t force, <HI>Fru&s;tra petis quod mox es re&s;tituturus;</HI> and this maxim accordingly furni&s;heth to the creditor in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a defence which is a &s;pecies of retention. There is, indeed, the &s;ame rea&s;on for &s;u&s;taining the exception of retention in this ca&s;e, that there is in per&s;onal debts. The foundation of the exception is in both ca&s;es the &s;ame, <HI>viz.</HI> the principle of utility, which is interpo&s;ed to prevent the multiplying of law-&s;uits, prejudicial to one of the par|ties at lea&s;t, and beneficial to neither.</P>
<P>But this relief again&s;t the &s;trictne&s;s of common law, ought not to be confined to real debts which intitle the creditor to po&s;&s;e&s;s. It may &s;ometimes happen, as demon&s;trated above <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 212.</NOTE>, to be more beneficial to the debtor or to the creditor, without hurting either, that the rents be applied for payment even of a per&s;onal debt, than for payment of the debt which is the title of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. And where-ever the rents may be applied for payment of a per&s;onal debt, the creditor mu&s;t be privileged to hold the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till that debt be paid.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Bona fide <HI>payment.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of money-tran&s;actions, and the payment of debt, it may happen by mi&s;take that payment is made, not to the per&s;on who is really the creditor, but to one under&s;tood to be the creditor. However invincible the error may be, payment made to any but to the creditor avails not at common law; becau&s;e none but the creditor can di&s;charge the debt. What remedy can be afforded by a court of equity where a debt is <HI>bona fide</HI> paid to another than the true creditor, is the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent chapter.</P>
<P>It is an ob&s;ervation verified by long experience, That no circum|&s;tance tends more to the advancement of commerce, than a free cir|culation of the goods of fortune from hand to hand. In this i&s;land, commercial law is &s;o much improved, as that land, moveables, debts, have all of them a free and expedite currency. A bond for borrowed money, in particular, de&s;cends to heirs, and is readily transferrable to a&s;&s;ignees voluntary or judicial. But that circum&s;tance, beneficial to commerce, proves in many in&s;tances hurtful to debtors. Payment made to any but the creditor, frees not the debtor at common law: and yet circum&s;tances may be often &s;uch, as to make it impracticable for the debtor to di&s;cover that the per&s;on who produceth a title, fair in appearance, is not the creditor. Here is a ca&s;e extremely nice in point of equity. On the one hand, if <HI>bona fide</HI> payment be not &s;u&s;|tained, the hard&s;hip will be great upon the debtor, who mu&s;t pay a &s;econd time to the true creditor. On the other hand, if the exception of <HI>bona fide</HI> payment be &s;u&s;tained to protect the debtor from a &s;econd payment, the creditor will be often forfeited of his debt without his fault. Here the &s;cales hang even, and equity preponderates not on either &s;ide. But the principle of utility affords relief to the debtor, and exerts all its weight in his &s;cale: for if a debtor were not &s;ecure by voluntary payment, no man would venture to pay a &s;hilling by any authority le&s;s than that of the &s;overeign court; and how ruinous to credit this would prove, mu&s;t be obvious without taking a moment for reflection.</P>
<P>To bring this matter nearer the eye, we &s;hall fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that the putative creditor proceeds to legal execution, and in that manner re|covers payment. Payment thus made by authority of law, mu&s;t undoubtedly protect the debtor from a &s;econd payment. And this
<PB N="260" REF="269">
leads to another ca&s;e, That the debtor, to prevent legal execution which threatens him, makes payment voluntarily. The payment here is made indeed without compul&s;ion, becau&s;e there is no actual execution: but then it is not made without authority; for, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, execution is awarded, and nothing prevents it but pay|ment. The third ca&s;e is of a clear bond, upon which execution mu&s;t be obtained as &s;oon as demanded; and the debtor pays, knowing of no defence. Why ought not he al&s;o to be &s;ecure in this ca&s;e? That he be &s;ecure, is beneficial to creditors as well as to debtors, becau&s;e otherwi&s;e there can be no free commerce of debts. This exception then of <HI>bona fide</HI> payment, is &s;upported by the principle of utility in two different re&s;pects: it is beneficial to creditors, by encouraging debtors to make prompt payment; and by removing from them the pretext of in&s;i&s;ting upon anxious and &s;crupulous defences, which, under the co|lour of paying &s;ecurely, would often be laid hold of to delay pay|ment: it is beneficial to debtors, who can pay with &s;afety without be|ing obliged to &s;uffer execution.</P>
<P>But here the true creditor is not left without a remedy. The &s;um received by the putative creditor is in his hand <HI>&s;ine ju&s;ta cau&s;a,</HI> and he is an&s;werable for it to the true creditor. In this view, the operation of <HI>bona fide</HI> payment is only to &s;ub&s;titute one debtor for another, which may as often be beneficial to the true creditor, as detrimental.</P>
<P>An executor under a revoked will, being ignorant of the revocation, pays legacies; and the revocation is afterward proved: he &s;hall be allowed the&s;e legacies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Chancery ca&s;es 126.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If, in making payment to the putative creditor, the debtor obtain an ea&s;e, the exception of <HI>bona fide</HI> payment will be &s;u&s;tained for that &s;um only which was really paid <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, July 19. 1665, John&s;ton contra Macgre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">or</NOTE>.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Interpo&s;ition of a court of equity in favour even of a &s;ingle per&s;on to prevent mi&s;chief.</HEAD>
<P>THIS &s;ubject is &s;o fully explained in the introduction as to require very little addition. It exhibits a court of equity in a new light; &s;howing that this court, acting upon the principle of utility, is not
<PB N="261" REF="270">
confined to what is properly termed <HI>juri&s;diction,</HI> but, in order to pre|vent mi&s;chief even to a &s;ingle per&s;on, can a&s;&s;ume magi&s;terial powers. It is by &s;uch power that the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion names factors to manage the e&s;tates of tho&s;e who are in foreign parts, and of infants who are de&s;titute of tutors. The authority interpo&s;ed for &s;elling the land-e&s;tate of a per&s;on under age, is properly of the &s;ame nature: for the inqui|ry made about the debts, and about the rationality of a &s;ale, though in the form of a proce&s;s, is an expi&s;cation merely.</P>
<P>By the Roman law, a &s;ale made by a tutor of his pupil's land|e&s;tate without authority of a judge, was void <HI>ip&s;o jure,</HI> as <HI>ultra vires.</HI> This &s;eems not to have been followed in Scotland. Maitland re|ports a ca&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dec. 1. 1565, Douglas contra Foreman.</NOTE>, where it was decreed, that &s;uch a &s;ale <HI>&s;ine decreto</HI> is not void, but that it is good if profitable to the infant. And I mu&s;t ap|prove this deci&s;ion as agreeable to principles and the nature of the thing. The interpo&s;ition of a court beforehand, is not to be&s;tow new powers upon a tutor, but to certify the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;ale, in order to encourage purcha&s;ers by rendering them &s;ecure. But if, without authority of a court, a purcha&s;er be found who pays a full price, and if the &s;ale be nece&s;&s;ary, where can the objection lie? So far indeed a court may ju&s;tly go, as to pre&s;ume le&s;ion from a &s;ale <HI>&s;ine decreto,</HI> until the tutor ju&s;tify the &s;ale as rational, and profitable to the infant.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Statutes preventive of wrong or mi&s;chief extended by a court of equity.</HEAD>
<P>STATUTES, as hinted above <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 177.</NOTE>, that have utility for their object, are of two kinds: Fir&s;t, Statutes directed for promoting the po&s;i|tive good of the whole &s;ociety, or of &s;ome part: Second, Statutes di|rected to prevent mi&s;chief only. Defective &s;tatutes of the latter kind may be &s;upplied by a court of equity; becau&s;e, independent of a &s;ta|tute, it is impowered to prevent mi&s;chief. But that court has not, more than a court of common law, any power to &s;upply defective &s;tatutes of the former kind; becau&s;e it belongs to the legi&s;lature only to make laws or regulations for promoting good po&s;itively.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="271">
U&s;ury is in it&s;elf innocent, but to prevent oppre&s;&s;ion it is prohi|bited by &s;tatute. Gaming is prohibited by &s;tatute; as al&s;o the pur|cha&s;ing law-&s;uits by members of the college of ju&s;tice. The&s;e in them&s;elves are not unju&s;t; but they tend to corrupt the morals, and prove often ruinous to individuals. Such &s;tatutes, preventive of wrong and mi&s;chief, may be extended by a court of equity, in order to complete the remedy intended by the legi&s;lature. It is chiefly with relation to &s;tatutes of this kind that Bacon delivers an opinion with great elegance: <Q REND="inline">"Bonum publicum in&s;igne rapit ad &s;e ca&s;us o|mi&s;&s;os. Quamobrem, quando lex aliqua reipublicae commoda notabiliter et majorem in modum intuetur et procurat, interpreta|tio ejus exten&s;iva e&s;to et amplians &dagger;."</Q></P>
<P>In this cla&s;s, as appears to me, our &s;tatute 1617 introducing the po&s;itive pre&s;cription ought to be placed. For it has not, like the Ro|man <HI>u&s;ucapio,</HI> the penal effect of forfeiting a proprietor for his negli|gence, and of transferring his property to another: it is calculated, on the contrary, to &s;ecure every man in his land-property, by deny|ing action upon old ob&s;olete claims, which, by the common law, are perpetual. A claim may be very old and yet very ju&s;t; and it is not therefore wrong in the common law to &s;u&s;tain &s;uch a claim. But then the con&s;equences ought to be con&s;idered: if a claim be &s;u&s;tained beyond forty or fifty years becau&s;e it may be ju&s;t, every claim mu&s;t be &s;u&s;tained however old; and experience di&s;covered, that this opens a wide door to fal&s;ehood. To prevent wrong and mi&s;chief, it was nece&s;&s;ary that land-property &s;hould by lap&s;e of time be &s;ecured again&s;t all claims; and as with re&s;pect to antiquated claims there is no infallible criterion to di&s;tingui&s;h good from bad, it was nece&s;&s;ary to bar them altogether by the lump. The pa&s;&s;age quoted from Bacon is appli|cable in the &s;tricte&s;t manner to this &s;tatute, con&s;idered in the light now mentioned; and it hath accordingly been extended in order to complete the remedy afforded by the legi&s;lature. To &s;ecure land-pro|perty again&s;t ob&s;olete claims, it mu&s;t be qualified, that the proprietor has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed peaceably forty years by virtue of a charter and &s;ei&s;in. So &s;ays the &s;tatute; and if the &s;tatute be taken &s;trictly, no property is protected from ob&s;olete claims but where infeftment is the title of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, preferring the end to the means, and con&s;ulting its own powers as a court of equity to prevent mi&s;|chief, &s;ecures by pre&s;cription every &s;ubject po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon a good title, a right to tithes for example, a long lea&s;e of land, or of tithes, which are titles that admit not infeftment <NOTE PLACE="foot">* De augmentis &s;cientiarum, l. 8. cap. 3. aphor. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="272">
As the foregoing &s;tatute was made to &s;ecure land from ob&s;olete and unju&s;t claims, &s;o the &s;tatutes 1469 and 1474, introducing the ne|gative pre&s;cription of obligations, were made to &s;ecure individuals per&s;onally from claims of the &s;ame kind. As the&s;e &s;tatutes all of them are preventive of mi&s;chief, they may all of them be extended by a court of equity to complete the remedy. The &s;tatutes accordingly now mentioned have been extended to mutual contracts, to decrees <HI>in foro contradictorio,</HI> and to reductions of deeds granted on death|bed <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">I am aware, that the &s;tatutes introducing the negative pre&s;cription have, by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, been con&s;idered in a different light. They have been held as a forfeiture even of a ju&s;t debt; for it was once judged, that after the forty years the defendant was not bound to give his oath upon the verity of the debt; and that though he &s;hould acknowledge the debt to be ju&s;t, yet he was not liable <HI>in foro humano,</HI> however he might be liable <HI>in foro poli et con|&s;cientiae; Fountainhall, December</HI> 7. 1703, <HI>Napier contra Campbell.</HI> That this is a wrong con&s;truction of the&s;e &s;tatutes I have endeavoured to &s;how above, <HI>p.</HI> 197.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the in&s;tances above mentioned, it mu&s;t, I imagine, oc|ca&s;ion &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, to find a propo&s;ition cheri&s;hed by our lawyers, That correctory &s;tatutes, as they are termed, ought never to be ex|tended. We have already &s;een this propo&s;ition contradicted, not only by &s;olid principles, but even by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion in many in&s;tan|ces. With relation to &s;tatutes, in particular, correctory of inju&s;tice or of wrong, no man can &s;eriou&s;ly doubt that a court of equity is impowered to extend &s;uch &s;tatutes, in order to complete the remedy pre&s;cribed by the legi&s;lature: and the &s;ame is equally clear with re|lation to &s;tatutes &s;upplying defects in common law. As to the &s;ta|tutes under con&s;ideration, calculated to prevent mi&s;chief, it might, I own, have once been more doubtful whether the&s;e could be extend|ed; for of all the powers a&s;&s;umed by a court of equity, it is pro|bable that the power of preventing mi&s;chief was the late&s;t. But in England this power has been long e&s;tabli&s;hed in the court of chance|ry, and experience has proved it to be a &s;alutary power. Why then &s;hould we &s;top &s;hort in the middle of our progre&s;s? No other excu&s;e can be given for &s;uch he&s;itation, but that our law, con&s;idered as a regular &s;y&s;tem, is of a much later date than that of England.</P>
<P>The foregoing are in&s;tances where the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, without he&s;itation, have &s;upplied defects in &s;tatutes made to prevent mi&s;chief. But to &s;how how de&s;ultory and fluctuating the practice of the court is in that particular, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to a &s;ingle ca&s;e on the o|ther &s;ide, which makes a figure in our law. In the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of land-property, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as well as by &s;ale, we require infeft|ment.
<PB N="264" REF="273">
An heir however, without completing his right by infeft|ment, is intitled to continue the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ance&s;tor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 5.</NOTE>. In this &s;ituation, behaving as proprietor, he contracts debts, and unle&s;s he be reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing large &s;ums, tho&s;e he deals with are &s;eldom &s;o &s;crupulous as to inquire into his title. By the common law however, the debtor's death before infeftment is, as to the real e&s;tate, a forfeiture of all his per&s;onal creditors. This is a mi&s;chief which well de&s;erved the interpo&s;ition of the legi&s;lature; and a remedy was provided by act 24. parl. 1695, enacting, <Q REND="inline">"That if an apparent heir have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for three years, the next heir, who by &s;ervice or adjudication connects with the predece&s;&s;or la&s;t infeft, &s;hall be liable to the apparent heir's debts <HI>in valorem</HI> of the heritage."</Q> It cannot be doubted, that a complete remedy was here intended, to give a rea&s;onable &s;ecurity that tho&s;e who deal with heirs-apparent &s;hall obtain payment of their debts. And yet, if we regard the words only, the remedy is imperfect; for what if the next heir-apparent, purpo&s;ely to evade the &s;tatute, &s;hall content him|&s;elf with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of the heritage, without ma|king up titles by &s;ervice or adjudication? Upon this &s;trict con&s;truc|tion of the &s;tatute, the creditors will reap little benefit. For if the debts be con&s;iderable, no heir will &s;ubject him&s;elf by completing his titles, when he is admitted to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and has the full enjoy|ment of the rents, without any title. Formerly the heir-apparent in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion had no intere&s;t to forbear the completing his titles: his ne|glect mu&s;t have been a&s;cribed to indolence or to inattention. But if the remedy intended by the &s;tatute reach not the heir-apparent in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, a &s;trong motive of intere&s;t ari&s;es to make him forbear the completing his titles. In this view, the &s;tatute, if confined to the words, mu&s;t appear extremely ab&s;urd. Here is indeed a remedy provided for a legal wrong: but what &s;ort of remedy? A remedy &s;o &s;trangely contrived, as to depend entirely upon that very per&s;on a|gain&s;t whom it is directed: for it is always in the power of the heir, by &s;atisfying him&s;elf with a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ory title, to di&s;appoint the credi|tors of their remedy; and as by this po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ory title he has the full en|joyment of the e&s;tate, he will always di&s;appoint them, if he regard his own intere&s;t. The legi&s;lature in this ca&s;e undoubtedly intended a complete remedy; and the con&s;ideration now mentioned, peculiar to this ca&s;e, is a &s;trong additional motive for the interpo&s;ition of a court of equity to fulfil the intendment of the legi&s;lature. And yet, mi&s;led by the notion that correctory laws ought not to be extended,
<PB N="265" REF="274">
the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion hath con&s;tantly denied action to the creditors of an heir who dies in apparency, again&s;t the next heir in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion who has not completed his title to the e&s;tate by &s;ervice or adjudication.</P>
<P>There is another palpable defect in this &s;tatute which ought al&s;o to be &s;upplied in equity. A predece&s;&s;or may have a good title to his e|&s;tate without being infeft; and yet regarding the words only, the heir-apparent is not liable upon this &s;tatute, unle&s;s where he connects with a predece&s;&s;or infeft. I put the following ca&s;e. A purcha&s;es an e&s;tate, takes a di&s;po&s;ition with procuratory and precept, but dies without being &s;ei&s;ed. B, his heir-apparent, enters into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without making up titles, and contracts debt after being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion three years. After his death, C, the next heir-apparent, makes up his titles by a general &s;ervice. This ca&s;e comes not under the words of the &s;tatute; but as it undoubtedly comes under the mi&s;chief which the legi&s;lature intended to remedy, it is the duty of a court of equity to complete the remedy.</P>
<P>In one ca&s;e the court, from a due &s;en&s;e of their equitable powers, ventured upon a remedy where this &s;tatute was defective. Some acres and hou&s;es having been di&s;poned for a valuable con&s;ideration by an heir-apparent three years in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the next heir-apparent fore&s;ee|ing that he would be barred by the act 1695 from objecting to this alienation if he &s;hould enter heir, bethought him&s;elf of a different method.

<HEAD>CONCLUSION of BOOK II.</HEAD>
<P>THE principle of ju&s;tice, though more exten&s;ive in its influence than that of utility, is in its nature more &s;imple: it never looks beyond the parties engaged in the &s;uit. The principle of utility, on the contrary, not only regards the parties engaged in the &s;uit, but al&s;o the &s;ociety in general; and comprehends many circum&s;tances concerning both. Being thus in its nature and application more in|tricate than ju&s;tice, I thought it not ami&s;s to clo&s;e this book with a few thoughts upon it. In the introduction there was occa&s;ion to hint, that utility co-operates &s;ometimes with ju&s;tice, and in oppo&s;i|tion prevails over it. This propo&s;ition is verified in the fir&s;t book by &s;everal in&s;tances, which I propo&s;e to bring under one view, in order to give a di&s;tinct notion of the co-operation and oppo&s;ition of the&s;e principles.</P>
<P>It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to be premi&s;ed, that in oppo&s;ing private utility to ju&s;tice, the latter ought always to prevail. A man is not bound to pro&s;ecute what is beneficial to him: he is not even bound to de|mand reparation for wrong done him. But he is &s;trictly bound to do his duty; and for that rea&s;on he him&s;elf mu&s;t be con&s;cious, that in oppo&s;ition to duty intere&s;t ought to have no weight. It is be&s;ide of great importance to &s;ociety that ju&s;tice have a free cour&s;e; and accor|dingly public utility unites with ju&s;tice to inforce right again&s;t inter|e&s;t. Private intere&s;t therefore, or private utility, may, in the pre&s;ent &s;peculation, be laid entirely a&s;ide; and it is barely mentioned to pro|vent mi&s;takes.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="276">
Another limitation is nece&s;&s;ary. It is not every &s;ort of public uti|lity that can outbalance ju&s;tice: it is that &s;ort only which is preventive of mi&s;chief affecting the whole or bulk of the &s;ociety. To prevent mi&s;chief to an individual coincides with private intere&s;t; and as to public utility, &s;o far as it concerns a po&s;itive additional good to the &s;ociety, it is a &s;ubject that comes not within the &s;phere of a court of equity.</P>
<P>Confining our view then to public utility directed to prevent mi&s;|chief, I venture to lay down the following propo&s;ition, That where|ever it is at variance with ju&s;tice, a court of equity ought not to in|force the latter, nor &s;uffer it to be inforced by a court of common law. In order to evince this propo&s;ition, which I &s;hall endeavour to do by induction, the proper method will be, to give a table of ca&s;es, beginning with tho&s;e where the two principles are in &s;trict u|nion, and proceeding orderly to tho&s;e where they are in declared op|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>In general, the&s;e principles for the mo&s;t part are good friends. The great end of e&s;tabli&s;hing a court of equity is, to have ju&s;tice accurate|ly di&s;tributed, even in the mo&s;t delicate circum&s;tances; and nothing contributes more to peace and union in &s;ociety than that this great end be &s;teadily pro&s;ecuted and completely fulfilled. As this branch therefore of utility is in&s;eparable from ju&s;tice, it will not be nece&s;&s;ary hereafter to make any expre&s;s mention of it. It mu&s;t be always un|der&s;tood when we talk of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>We proceed to other branches of utility, which are not &s;o &s;trictly at|tached to ju&s;tice, but &s;ometimes coincide with it, and &s;ometimes ri&s;e in oppo&s;ition. One of the&s;e is the benefit accruing to the &s;ociety by abridging law-&s;uits. In the ca&s;e of compen&s;ation, utility unites with ju&s;tice to make compen&s;ation a &s;trong plea in every court of equity. Retention again depends entirely upon the utility of abridging law-&s;uits. But if it have no &s;upport from ju&s;tice, neither is it oppo&s;ed by ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of <HI>bona fide</HI> payment the utility is different. It is the benefit accruing to a mercantile &s;ociety by giving a free cour&s;e to money-tran&s;actions, which would be ob&s;tructed if debtors, by run|ning any ri&s;k in making payment, were encouraged to &s;tate anxious or frivolous defences. The exception of <HI>bona fide</HI> payment is &s;u&s;tain|ed upon no other ground but that of preventing the mi&s;chief here de&s;cribed. Ju&s;tice weighs equally on both &s;ides; for if the exception be not &s;u&s;tained, the hone&s;t debtor bears the hazard of lo&s;ing his
<PB N="268" REF="277">
money: if it be &s;u&s;tained, the hazard is transferred upon the cre|ditor.</P>
<P>But there are ca&s;es where ju&s;tice and utility take oppo&s;ite &s;ides: which, in particular, is the ca&s;e where a tran&s;action extremely unequal is occa&s;ioned by error. Here the ju&s;tice of affording relief is obvious: but then a tran&s;action by putting an end to &s;trife is a favourite of law; and it is again&s;t the intere&s;t of the public to weigh a tran&s;action in the nice balance of grains and &s;cruples. A man, by care and atten|tion in making a tran&s;action, may avoid error; but the bad con&s;e|quences of opening tran&s;actions upon every ground of equity cannot be avoided. Ju&s;tice therefore mu&s;t in this ca&s;e yield to utility; and a tran&s;action will be &s;upported again&s;t errors that may be &s;ufficient to overturn other agreements. I give another example. In the Roman law <HI>lae&s;io ultra duplum</HI> was &s;u&s;tained to void a bargain: but in Britain we refu&s;e to li&s;ten to equity in this ca&s;e; for if complaints of inequa|lity were indulged, law-&s;uits would be multiplied, to the great detri|ment of commerce.</P>
<P>If the di&s;couraging law-&s;uits be &s;ufficient to with-hold relief in equity, the hazard of making judges arbitrary is a much &s;tronger motive for with-holding that relief. However clear a ju&s;t claim or defence may be, a court of equity ought not to interpo&s;e, unle&s;s the ca&s;e can be brought under a general rule. No &s;ort of oppre&s;&s;ion is more intolerable than what is done under the colour of law: and for that rea&s;on, judges ought to be confined to general rules, the only method invented to prevent legal oppre&s;&s;ion. Here the refu&s;ing to do ju&s;tice to a &s;ingle per&s;on makes no figure, when &s;et in oppo&s;ition to an important intere&s;t that concerns deeply the whole &s;ociety. And in|deed it &s;eems to follow, from the very nature of a court of equity, that it ought to adhere to general rules, even at the expence of for|bearing to do ju&s;tice. It is the declared purpo&s;e of a court of equity, to promote the good of &s;ociety by an accurate di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice: but the means ought to be &s;ubordinate to the end; and therefore, if in any ca&s;e ju&s;tice cannot be done but by u&s;ing means that tend to the hurt of &s;ociety, a court of equity ought not to interpo&s;e. To be active in &s;uch a ca&s;e, involves the ab&s;urdity of preferring the means to the end.</P>
<P>Thus we may gather by induction, that in every ca&s;e where it is the intere&s;t of the public to with-hold ju&s;tice from an individual, it becomes the duty of a court of equity in that circum&s;tance, not only to ab&s;tain from inforcing the ju&s;t claim or defence, but al&s;o to prevent
<PB N="269" REF="278">
its being inforced at common law. But the influence of public utili|ty &s;tops here, and never authori&s;es a court of equity to inforce any po|&s;itive act of inju&s;tice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this doctrine illu&s;trated, Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 2.</NOTE>. For, fir&s;t, I cannot di&s;cover that it ever can be the intere&s;t of the public to require the doing an unju&s;t action. And, next, if even &s;elf-pre&s;ervation will not ju&s;tify any wrong done by a private per&s;on <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Preliminary di&s;cour&s;e, p. 13.</NOTE>, much le&s;s will public utility, &s;uppo&s;ing it in|tere&s;ted, be able to ju&s;tify any wrong done or inforced by a court of e|quity. It is incon&s;i&s;tent with the very con&s;titution of this court to do inju&s;tice, or to inforce it.</P>

<P>HITHERTO our plan has been, to &s;et forth the different powers of a court of equity; and to illu&s;trate the&s;e powers by apt examples &s;elected from various &s;ubjects where they could be be&s;t found. Our plan in the pre&s;ent book is, to &s;how the applica|tion of the&s;e powers to various &s;ubjects, handled each as an entire whole: and the &s;ubjects cho&s;en are &s;uch as cannot ea&s;ily be &s;plit into parts to be di&s;tributed under the different heads formerly explained. Be&s;ide, as the various powers of a court of equity have been &s;ufficiently illu&s;trated, as well as the principles on which they are founded, I thought it would be plea&s;ant as well as in&s;tructive to vary the me|thod, by connecting together the&s;e powers and principles in their co|operation upon particular &s;ubjects. Thus the di&s;tribution of the whole appears in the following light: the fir&s;t and &s;econd books may be con&s;idered as theoretical, containing the powers of a court of equi|ty, and the principles on which the&s;e powers are founded; the pre|&s;ent book is practical, containing the application of the&s;e powers and principles to &s;everal important &s;ubjects.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. What equity rules with re&s;pect to rents levied upon an er|roneous title of property.</HEAD>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to land po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon an erroneous title of proper|ty, it is a rule e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Roman law, and among mo|dern nations, That the true proprietor a&s;&s;erting his right to the land, has not a claim for the rents levied by the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and con|&s;umed. But though this &s;ubject is handled at large both by the Ro|man lawyers, and by their commentators, we are left in the dark as to the rea&s;on of the rule, and of the principle upon which it is found|ed. Perhaps it was thought, that the proprietor has not an action at common law for the value of the product con&s;umed by the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; or perhaps, that the action, as rigorous and unju&s;t, is ren|dered ineffectual by equity. And indeed, as no title of property can ab&s;olutely be relied on, &s;ad would be the condition of land-holders,
<PB N="271" REF="280">
could they be made liable forty years back, for rents which they had rea&s;on to believe their own, and which without &s;cruple they be&s;tow'd upon the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life.</P>
<P>Though, in all views, the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or is &s;ecure again&s;t re&s;titu|tion, it is however of importance to a&s;certain the preci&s;e principle that affords him &s;ecurity; for upon that preliminary point &s;everal im|portant que&s;tions depend. We &s;hall therefore without further pre|face enter upon the inquiry.</P>
<P>The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, as ob&s;erved, mu&s;t, for his &s;ecurity, be indebted ei|ther to the common law or to equity. If common law afford to the proprietor a claim for the value of his rents con&s;umed, it mu&s;t be e|quity correcting the rigor of common law that protects the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or from this claim: but if the proprietor have not a claim at common law, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or has no occa&s;ion for equity. The matter then is re|&s;olvable into the following que&s;tion, Whether there be or be not a claim at common law. And to this que&s;tion, which is &s;ubtile, we mu&s;t lend attention.</P>
<P>Searching for materials to rea&s;on upon, what fir&s;t occurs is the dif|ference between natural and indu&s;trial fruits. The former, owing their exi&s;tence not to man but to the land &s;olely, will readily be thought an acce&s;&s;ory that mu&s;t follow the property of the land. The latter will be viewed in a different light; for indu&s;trial fruits owe their exi&s;tence to labour and indu&s;try, more than to the land. Up|on this very circum&s;tance does Ju&s;tinian found the right of the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: <Q REND="inline">"Si quis a non domino quem dominum e&s;&s;e credide|rit, bona fide fundum emerit, vel ex donatione, aliave qualibet ju&s;ta cau&s;a, aeque bona fide acceperit; naturalirationi placuit, fructus, quos percepit, ejus e&s;&s;e pro cultura et cura. Et ideo, &s;i po&s;tea dominus &s;upervenerit, et fundum vindicet, de fructibus ab eo con&s;umptis agere non pote&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">&sect; 35. In&s;tit. De rer. divi&s;ione.</NOTE>."</Q> And upon this foundation Pomponius pro|nounces, that the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or acquires right to the indu&s;trial fruits only: <Q REND="inline">"Fructus percipiendo, uxor vel vir, ex re donata, &s;uos facit: illos tamen quos &s;uis operis adqui&s;ierit, veluti &s;erendo. Nam &s;i pomum decerp&s;erit, vel ex &s;ylva cedit, non fit ejus: &s;icuti nec cuju&s;libet bonae fidei po&s;&s;e&s;&s;oris, quia non ex facto ejus fructus na&s;citur <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 45. De u&s;uris.</NOTE>."</Q> Paulus goes farther. He admits not any di&s;tinction between natural and indu&s;trial fruits; but is po&s;itive, that both kinds equally, as &s;oon as &s;eparated from the ground, belong to the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: <Q REND="inline">"Bonae fidei emptor non dubie percipiendo fructus, etiam
<PB N="272" REF="281">
ex aliena re, &s;uos interim facit, non tantum eos qui diligentia et opera ejus pervenerunt, &s;ed omnes; quia quod ad fructus attinet, loco domini pene e&s;t. Denique etiam, priu&s;quam percipiat, &s;tatim ubi a &s;olo &s;eparati &s;unt, bonae fidei emptoris fiunt <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 48. pr. De acquir. rer. dom.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>But now, after drawing &s;o nigh in appearance to a conclu&s;ion, we &s;tumble upon an unexpected ob&s;truction. Is the foregoing doctrine con&s;i&s;tent with the principle <HI>Quod &s;atum &s;olo cedit &s;olo?</HI> If corns while growing make part of the ground, and con&s;equently belong to the proprietor of the ground, the act of &s;eparation merely, cannot have the effect to transfer the property from him to another. And if this hold as to fruits that are indu&s;trial, the argument concludes with greater force if po&s;&s;ible as to natural fruits. What then &s;hall be thought of the opinions delivered above by the Roman writers? Their authority is great I confe&s;s, and yet no authority will ju&s;tify us in de|viating from clear principles. The fruits, indu&s;trial as well as natu|ral, after &s;eparation as well as before, belong to the proprietor of the land. He has undoubtedly an action at common law to vindicate the fruits while extant: and if &s;o, has he not al&s;o a claim for the va|lue after con&s;umption?</P>
<P>However prone we may be to an&s;wer the foregoing que&s;tion in the affirmative, let us however &s;u&s;pend our judgement till the que&s;tion be fairly canva&s;&s;ed. It is indeed clear, that the fruits while extant, the <HI>percepti</HI> as well as <HI>pendentes,</HI> belong to the proprietor of the land, and can be claimed by a <HI>rei vindicatio</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Whether he may not in equity be liable for &s;ome recompence to the per&s;on by who&s;e labour the indu&s;trial fruits were rai&s;ed, is a different que&s;tion.</NOTE>. But is it equally clear, that the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or who con&s;umes the fruits is liable for their value? Upon what medium is this claim founded? The fruits are indeed con&s;umed by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and the proprietor is thereby de|prived of his property: but it cannot be &s;ub&s;umed, that he is depri|ved of it by the fault of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; for, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or was <HI>in bona fide</HI> to con&s;ume, and was not guilty of the &s;light|e&s;t fault. Let us endeavour to gather light from a &s;imilar ca&s;e. A man buys a hor&s;e <HI>bona &s;ide</HI> from one who is not proprietor: upon ur|gent bu&s;ine&s;s he makes a very &s;evere journey, and the hor&s;e, unable to &s;upport the fatigue, dies. Is the purcha&s;er an&s;werable for the value of the hor&s;e? There is no principle of law upon which that claim can be founded. In general, a proprietor deprived of his goods by the fact of another, cannot claim the value upon any footing but that of reparation: but it is a rule e&s;tabli&s;hed both in the law of nature
<PB N="273" REF="282">
and in municipal law, That a man free from fault or blame, is not liable to repair any hurt done by him: one in all re&s;pects innocent, is not &s;ubjected to reparation more than to puni&s;hment <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the preliminary di&s;cour&s;e.</NOTE>. And thus it comes out clear, that there is no action at common law a|gain&s;t the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or for the value of the fruits he con&s;umes: &s;uch an action mu&s;t re&s;olve into a claim of damages, to which the innocent cannot be &s;ubjected.</P>
<P>And if <HI>bona fides</HI> protect the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or when he him&s;elf con&s;umes the fruits, it will equally protect his tenants. A man who takes a lea&s;e from one who is held to be proprietor of the land, is <HI>in bona fide</HI> as well as his landlord. The fruits, therefore, that the tenant con&s;umes or di&s;po&s;es of, will not &s;ubject him to a claim of damages; and if the proprietor have no claim for their value, he can as little claim the rent paid for them.</P>
<P>As the common law affords not an action in this ca&s;e, equity is &s;till more aver&s;e to &s;uch action. The proprietor no doubt is a lo&s;er; and, which is a more material circum&s;tance, what he lo&s;es is converted to the u&s;e of the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. But then, though the proprietor be a lo&s;er, the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or is not a gainer: the fruits or rents are con&s;umed upon living, and not a ve&s;tige of them remains <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or cannot be reached by an <HI>actio in rem ver&s;um;</HI> for this action takes place only where the goods applied to my u&s;e are known by me to belong to another.</NOTE>. Thus equity rules even where the claim is brought recently. But where it is brought at a di&s;tance of time, for the rents of many years, again&s;t a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or who regularly con&s;umed his annual income, and had no rea&s;on to dread or &s;u&s;pect a claim, the hard&s;hip is &s;o great, and the claim it&s;elf in the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;o unju&s;t, that were it founded on common law, the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or would undoubtedly be relieved again&s;t it by equity.</P>
<P>What is now &s;aid &s;ugge&s;ts another ca&s;e. Suppo&s;e the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or to be <HI>locupletior</HI> by the rents he has levied. It is in mo&s;t cir|cum&s;tances difficult to a&s;certain this point: but circum&s;tances may be &s;uppo&s;ed to make it clear. The rents, for example, are a&s;&s;igned by the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or for payment of his proper debts: the creditors continue in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till their claims are wholly extingui&s;hed; and then the true proprietor di&s;covering his right, enters upon the &s;tage. Here it can be qualified, that the <HI>bona &s;ide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or is <HI>locupletior,</HI> and that he has gained preci&s;ely the amount of the debts now &s;atisfied and paid. Admitting then the fact, that the <HI>bona &s;ide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or is en|riched by his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the que&s;tion is, Whether this circum&s;tance
<PB N="274" REF="283">
will &s;upport any action again&s;t him? None at common law, for the rea&s;on above given, that there is nothing to found an action of repa|ration or damages in this ca&s;e, more than where the rents are con&s;u|med upon living. But that equity affords an action is clear; for the maxim <HI>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura</HI> is applicable to this ca&s;e in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e: the effects of the proprietor are converted to the u&s;e of the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: what is lo&s;t by the one, is gained by the other; and therefore, equity lays hold of that gain to make up the lo&s;s. This point is &s;o evidently founded on equity, that even af|ter repeated in&s;tances of wandering from ju&s;tice in other points, I cannot help te&s;tifying &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, that the celebrated Vinnius, not to mention Voet and other commentators, &s;hould reject the proprie|tor's claim even in this ca&s;e. And I am the more &s;urpri&s;ed, that in this opinion they make a &s;tep not le&s;s bold than uncommon, which is, to de&s;ert their guides who pa&s;s for being infallible, I mean the Roman writers, who ju&s;tly maintain that the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or is liable <HI>quatenus locupletior.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Con&s;uluit &s;enatus bonae fidei po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ori|bus, ne in totum damno adficiantur, &s;ed in id duntaxat teneantur in quo locupletiores facti &s;unt. Quemcunque igitur &s;umptum fe|cerint ex hereditate, &s;i quid dilapidaverunt, perdiderunt, dum re &s;ua &s;e abuti putant, non prae&s;tabunt: nec &s;i donaverint, locuple|tiores facti videbuntur, quamvis ad remunerandum &s;ibi aliquem na|turaliter obligaverunt <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 25. &sect; 11. De hered. pet.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>When the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or becomes <HI>locupletior</HI> by extreme frugality and par&s;imony, it may be more doubtful whether a claim can lie a|gain&s;t him. It mu&s;t appear hard, that his &s;tarving him&s;elf and his family, or his extraordinary anxiety to lay up a &s;tock for his children, &s;hould &s;ubject him to a claim which his prodigality would free him from; and yet I cannot &s;ee that this con&s;ideration will prevent the o|peration of the maxim <HI>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura.</HI></P>
<P>The foregoing di&s;qui&s;ition is not only curious but u&s;eful. Among other things, it &s;erves to determine an important que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> Whe|ther <HI>bona fides,</HI> which relieves the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or from accounting for the rents, will at the &s;ame time prevent the imputation of the&s;e rents toward extinction of a real debt belonging to him. A man, for example, who has claims upon an e&s;tate by infeftments of annualrent, adjudi|cations, or &s;uch like, enters into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion upon a title of property which he believes to be unexceptionable. When the lamene&s;s of his title is di&s;covered, his <HI>bona fides</HI> will &s;ecure him from accounting for the rents to the true proprietor; but will it al&s;o pre&s;erve his debts
<PB N="275" REF="284">
alive, and &s;ave them from being extingui&s;hed by his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the rents? The an&s;wer to this que&s;tion depends upon the point di&s;cu&s;&s;ed above. If the proprietor have, at common law though not in equity, a claim for the value of the rents con&s;umed by the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, this value, as appears to me, mu&s;t go in extinction of the debts af|fecting the &s;ubject. For when the proprietor, in&s;tead of demanding the money to be paid to him&s;elf, in&s;i&s;ts only, that it &s;hall be apply'd to extingui&s;h the real incumbrances; equity interpo&s;eth not again&s;t this demand, which is neither rigorous nor unju&s;t: and if equity in|terpo&s;e not, the extinction mu&s;t take place. If, on the other hand, there be no claim at common law for the value of the rents con&s;umed, I cannot perceive any foundation for extingui&s;hing the real debts be|longing to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; unle&s;s the following propo&s;ition can be main|tained, That the very act of levying the rents extingui&s;hes <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> the&s;e debts, without nece&s;&s;ity of applying to a judge for his interpo&s;i|tion. This propo&s;ition holds true where a real debt is the title for le|vying the rents; as, for example, where they are levied upon a poind|ing of the ground, or upon an adjudication completed by a decree of mails and duties. But it cannot hold in the ca&s;e under con&s;ideration; becau&s;e, by the very &s;uppo&s;ition, the rents are levied upon a title of property, and not by virtue of the real debts.</P>
<P>I illu&s;trate this point by &s;tating the following ca&s;e. An adjud|ger infeft enters into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land adjudged after the legal is expired, con&s;idering his adjudication to be a right of property. After many years po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the per&s;on again&s;t whom the adjudication was led, or his heir, claims the property, urging a defect in the adjudi|cation which prevented expiration of the legal. It is decreed accor|dingly, that the adjudication never became a right of property, but that the legal is &s;till current. Here it comes out in fact, that the land has all along been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon the title of a real debt, extin|gui&s;hable by levying the rents, though by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or under&s;tood to be a title of property. I think, that even in this ca&s;e the levying the rents will not extingui&s;h the debt. I give my rea&s;on. To give vo|luntary payment its full effect, two acts mu&s;t concur, <HI>viz.</HI> delivery by the debtor in order to extingui&s;h the debt, and acceptance by the creditor as payment. In legal payment by execution there mu&s;t al&s;o be two acts; fir&s;t, levying the rent in order to be apply'd for pay|ment of the debt; and, next, the creditor's receiving the &s;ame as pay|ment: neither of which acts are found in the ca&s;e under con&s;idera|tion. The rent is levied, not by virtue of execution in order to extin|gui&s;h a debt, but upon a title of property: neither is the rent received
<PB N="276" REF="285">
by a creditor as payment, but by a man who conceives him&s;elf to be proprietor.</P>
<P>The foregoing rea&s;oning, which becau&s;e of its intricacy is drawn out to a con&s;iderable length, may, when thoroughly apprehended, be brought within a narrow compa&s;s. A <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or who le|vies and con&s;umes the rents, is not liable to account to the proprie|tor who&s;e rents they were, nor is &s;ubjected to any action whether in law or in equity; and for that rea&s;on his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the rents will not have the effect to extingui&s;h any debt in his per&s;on affecting the &s;ubject. But if it can be &s;pecified that he is <HI>locupletior</HI> by his po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, that circum&s;tance affords to the proprietor a claim again&s;t him in equity; of which the proprietor, at his option, may either de|mand payment, or in&s;i&s;t that the &s;um be applied for extingui&s;hing the debts upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the&s;e conclu&s;ions I have been forc'd to differ from the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed practice of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, which indeed protects the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or from payment; but always holds the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as &s;ufficient to extingui&s;h the real debts belonging to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. But I have had the le&s;s reluctance in differing from the e&s;tabli&s;hed practice, be|ing &s;en&s;ible that this matter has not been examined with all the ac|curacy of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible. In particular, we are not told up|on what ground the practice is founded: and if it be founded on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the proprietor has a legal claim for his rents le|vied by the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, I have clearly proved this to be a &s;up|po&s;ition merely without any foundation.</P>
<P>Another important que&s;tion has a near analogy to that now di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed. If the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or have made con&s;iderable improve|ments upon the &s;ubject, by which its value is increa&s;ed, will his claim be &s;u&s;tained as far as the proprietor is benefited by the&s;e im|provements, or will it be compen&s;ated by the rents he has levied? Keeping in view what is &s;aid upon the foregoing que&s;tion, one will readily an&s;wer, that the proprietor, having no claim for the rents le|vied and con&s;umed by the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, has no ground upon which to plead compen&s;ation: But upon a more narrow in&s;pection, we perceive, that this que&s;tion depends upon a different principle. It is a maxim &s;ugge&s;ted by nature, That the expence laid out in procu|ring any benefit is a preferable burden upon the profits made there|by; and in particular, that reparations and meliorations be&s;towed upon a hou&s;e or upon land ought to be defray'd out of the rents. Governed by this maxim, we &s;u&s;tain no claim again&s;t the proprietor for meliorations, if the expence exceed not the rents levied by the
<PB N="277" REF="286">
<HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. It is not properly compen&s;ation; for the proprie|tor has no claim to found a compen&s;ation upon. The claim is reject|ed upon a different medium: the rents while extant belong to the pro|prietor of the ground: the&s;e rents are not con&s;umed, but are be&s;tow|ed upon meliorations; and the <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or who thus employs the proprietor's money, and not a farthing of his own, has no claim either in law or in equity. Such accordingly is the determination of Papinian, the mo&s;t &s;olid of all the Roman writers: <Q REND="inline">"Sumptus in praedium, quod alienum e&s;&s;e apparuit, a bona fide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ore facti, neque ab eo qui praedium donavit, neque a domino peti po&s;&s;unt; verum, exceptione doli po&s;ita, per officium judicis aequitatis ratione &s;ervantur; &s;cilicet &s;i fructuum ante litem conte&s;tatam perceptorum &s;ummam excedunt.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Powers of a court of equity with re&s;pect to a conventional penalty.</HEAD>
<P>CONVENTIONAL penalties are of two kinds. One is, where a per&s;on bound <HI>ad factum prae&s;tandum</HI> agrees, in ca&s;e of failure, to pay a &s;um of money: the other is, where a &s;um is &s;tipulated to in|force performance of any obligation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t kind is explained by Ju&s;tinian in the following words. <Q REND="inline">"Non &s;olum res in &s;tipulatum deduci po&s;&s;unt, &s;ed etiam facta; ut &s;i &s;tipulemur aliquid fieri vel non fieri. Et in huju&s;modi &s;tipulationi|bus optimum erit poenam &s;ubjicere, ne quantitas &s;tipulationis in incerto &s;it, ac nece&s;&s;e &s;it actori probare quod ejus inter&s;it. Itaque &s;i quis, ut fiat aliquid, &s;tipuletur; ita adjici poena debet, <HI>Si ita fac|tum non erit, tunc poenae nomine decem aureos dare &s;pondes</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">&sect; 7. In&s;tit. De verb. oblig.</NOTE>."</Q> A &s;tipu|lation of this kind con&s;titutes properly an alternative obligation, put|ting it in the option of the obligor to perform the fact, or in place of it to pay the penal &s;um. And it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that this &s;um is improperly termed <HI>a penalty;</HI> for it is in reality a liquidation of the damages that the obligee &s;uffers by want of performance; or rather a lump &s;um agreed on in place of damages. A &s;um thus &s;tipulated, having nothing penal in its nature, is due in equity as well as at common law. Thus land being verbally &s;et to a tenant, under the
<PB N="278" REF="287">
following condition, That if he entered not he &s;hould pay a year's rent; the whole penalty was decreed, becau&s;e the tenant entered not <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, July 15. 1637, Skene.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The other kind of penalty is, where, be&s;ide performance of what is &s;tipulated in the contract, the obligor is taken bound, if he fail of punctual performance, to pay a &s;um over and above: as, for ex|ample, the debtor becomes bound to pay the &s;um borrowed at a term &s;pecified; and, in order to inforce punctual performance, he becomes bound, if he &s;uffer the term to elap&s;e without payment, to pay an additional &s;um. Here, in ca&s;e of failure, both articles mu&s;t be fulfilled, the additional article as well as that which is principal; and therefore the additional article is more properly a penalty than that fir&s;t mentioned, where the obligation is alternative.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to a penalty of this kind, it is clear, that a good de|fence again&s;t performance of what is principal, will relieve al&s;o from the penalty: but if there be no good defence, the penalty is due by agreement as &s;oon as there is a failure in the performance; and may be demanded at common law by an action <HI>ex contractu.</HI> Voet accor|dingly &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Committitur haec poenae &s;tipulatio, &s;i principalis obli|gatio, quae &s;tipulatione penali firmata erat, impleta non &s;it, cum de jure implenda fui&s;&s;et <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">&sect; 13. De verb. oblig.</NOTE>."</Q> And to prove this po&s;ition he gives the authority of Paulus in the following words: <Q REND="inline">"Ad diem &s;ub poe|na pecunia promi&s;&s;a, et ante diem mortuo promi&s;&s;ore, committe|tur poena, licet non &s;it hereditas ejus adita <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 77. ibid.</NOTE>."</Q> For here the death of the debtor before the term of payment afforded no legal defence to his heir; nor ought the creditor to &s;uffer by that accident, <HI>cui de jure implenda erat obligatio,</HI> in the foregoing words of Voet.</P>
<P>Whether and how far equity will mitigate a penalty of this kind, comes next to be con&s;idered. What will at fir&s;t occur is, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h culpable failure from what is innocent, and to afford relief in the latter ca&s;e only. But a more accurate in&s;pection will &s;how this to be an Utopian thought, un&s;uited to practice. The extreme diffi|culty of making good this di&s;tinction by evidence, would render judges arbitrary, without attaining that refinement of ju&s;tice which is intended by the di&s;tinction: and therefore it becomes nece&s;&s;ary in practice to give relief to all without di&s;tinction, unle&s;s where it can be made clearly appear that the failure is culpable.</P>
<P>The next point is, How far equity will relieve. When an obligor who performs late, demands to be relieved from the penal &s;um, ju&s;tice requires that the obligee be indemnified of what damage he has &s;u&s;|tained
<PB N="279" REF="288">
by the delay; according to a rule in equity formerly mention|ed, which the Engli&s;h lawyers expre&s;s thus, <Q REND="inline">"He that demands e|quity mu&s;t give equity."</Q> And hence in this i&s;land it is the con|&s;tant practice to decree the penalty to the extent of the damage; and this the obligee is intitled to, however innocent or involuntary the delay may have been. A debtor, for example, di&s;appoined of mo|ney, fails to make payment at the term covenanted, which draws up|on him a &s;torm of execution: however innocent, he mu&s;t pay the penalty re&s;tricted to the expence of execution; becau&s;e the conven|tional penalty &s;o far is not a puni&s;hment upon the debtor, but repa|ration to the creditor; and &s;o far it is due in equity as well as at common law. Take another example. A debtor &s;u&s;pends his bond <HI>bona fide;</HI> and the creditor, after di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, is &s;atisfied to re&s;trict his penalty to the co&s;ts of &s;uit: the penalty thus re&s;tricted is not a penal claim, and therefore is due in equity as well as at common law. This example may be viewed in a dif|ferent light: there mu&s;t be error, at lea&s;t, in every ca&s;e where the obligor refu&s;es to fulfil a ju&s;t claim, however innocent he may be; and equity relieves from the effect of error, &s;o far only as the per&s;on who takes the advantage of the error is <HI>in lucro captando,</HI> not where he is <HI>in damno evitando</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 98.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>An Engli&s;h double bond is an example of the &s;econd kind of con|ventional penalties. It was introduced originally to evade the com|mon law of England, which prohibits the taking intere&s;t for money: and though that prohibition be no longer in force, the double bond continues in practice; being converted into a different u&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> to compel punctual payment of the money lent. The penalty accor|dingly is due at common law if the covenanted term be allowed to elap&s;e without payment: and this penal &s;tipulation is in the practice of England governed by the rule of equity above laid down: <Q REND="inline">"After the day of payment the double &s;um becomes the legal debt; and there is no remedy again&s;t &s;uch penalty but by application to a court of equity, which relieves on payment of principal, intere&s;t, and co&s;ts <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">New abridg. of the law, vol. 3. p. 691.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>In our bonds for payment of money, a clau&s;e generally is added binding the debtor <Q REND="inline">"to pay a fifth part more of liquidate expences in ca&s;e of failzie."</Q> This clau&s;e is commonly treated as intending a penalty of the kind la&s;t mentioned, contrived to inforce perform|ance: but I think improperly; for the words plainly import a liqui|dation of that damage which the creditor may &s;u&s;tain by the debtor's
<PB N="280" REF="289">
failing to pay at the term covenanted. It is of the nature of a tran&s;|action <HI>de re futura,</HI> being a lump &s;um in place of all that can be demanded in ca&s;e of future damage by the &s;aid failure. Lord Stair, talking of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion as a court of equity, con&s;iders the clau&s;e in the foregoing light: <Q REND="inline">"The court of &s;e&s;&s;ion (&s;ays our au|thor) modifies exorbitant penalties in bonds and contracts, even though they bear the name of liquidate expences with con&s;ent of parties, which nece&s;&s;itous debtors yield to. The&s;e the Lords retrench to the real expence and damage of the parties. Yet the&s;e clau&s;es have this effect, that the Lords take &s;lender proba|tion of the true expence, and do not con&s;ider whether it be nece&s;|&s;ary or not, provided it exceed not the &s;um agreed on; whereas in other ca&s;es they allow no expence but what is nece&s;&s;ary or profit|able <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">lib. 4. tit. 3. &sect; 1.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Con&s;idering the foregoing clau&s;e as a tran&s;action <HI>de re futura,</HI> it may be doubted, whether in any ca&s;e it ought to be mitigated. On the one hand, whatever be the extent of the damage, the creditor by a|greement can demand no more but the liquidated &s;um; and there|fore, on the other, it may be thought that he is intitled to this &s;um even where it exceeds his damage: <HI>Cujus incommodum, ejus debet e&s;&s;e com|modum.</HI> This argument is conclu&s;ive, &s;uppo&s;ing the tran&s;action fair and equal, &s;tipulating no greater &s;um than the damages ordinarily amount to. But it ought to be con&s;idered, that formerly money|lenders in Scotland were in condition to give law to tho&s;e who bor|row. Hence exorbitant &s;ums as liquidate expences, which, being ri|gorous and oppre&s;&s;ive, ought to be mitigated in equity. Upon that account, the lump &s;um for damages has been generally con&s;idered as a penalty; which in effect it is when exorbitant, and as &s;uch it &s;hall hereafter be treated of.</P>
<P>The only doubtful point touching this penalty, is to determine at what time and by what means it is incurred. If we adhere to the words of the clau&s;e, it is incurred by <HI>failzie</HI> in general, and con&s;equent|ly by every &s;ort of failzie. But many good lawyers, moved with the hard&s;hip of &s;ubjecting an innocent per&s;on to a penalty, hold, that the penalty is not incurred except in the ca&s;e of culpable failzie, and that this mu&s;t be under&s;tood the meaning of the clau&s;e. They maintain accordingly, that when a debtor, in place of payment, enters into a law-&s;uit, he is not liable for any part of the penalty, though re&s;tricted to the co&s;ts of &s;uit, if he have <HI>probabilis cau&s;a litigandi.</HI> They do not advert, as above laid down, that a conventional penalty re&s;tricted to
<PB N="281" REF="290">
the expence of execution or co&s;ts of &s;uit, cea&s;es in that ca&s;e to be pe|nal; and that the creditor, when &s;uch claim is made effectual to him, draws nothing but what he hath actually expended. But as this is a point of great importance in practice, it merits a deliberate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; to which I proceed.</P>
<P>In order to give &s;atisfaction upon this &s;ubject, I mu&s;t &s;tate a pre|liminary point, <HI>viz.</HI> What claim there is for co&s;ts of &s;uit ab&s;tracting from a conventional penalty. A man who oppo&s;es a ju&s;t claim, acts again&s;t law: but is he therefore bound to repair the damage he occa|&s;ions to the pur&s;uer? If he be litigious in any degree, he is bound; for though it may require a crime to &s;ubject a man to puni&s;hment, the &s;lighte&s;t voluntary wrong or fault is a &s;ufficient foundation for damages, even at common law. But it is a rule in municipal law, derived from the law of nature, <Q REND="inline">"That a man free from fault or blame is not liable to repair any hurt he occa&s;ions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the chapter immediately foregoing.</NOTE>;"</Q> and there|fore there is no foundation even at common law for &s;ubjecting to the co&s;ts of &s;uit, or to any damage, a defendant who is <HI>in bona fide.</HI> Equity is &s;till more aver&s;e from making an innocent per&s;on in any ca&s;e liable to damages; for, con&s;idering that man is a fallible being, his ca&s;e would be deplorable were he bound to repair all the lo&s;s he may occa&s;ion by an involuntary wrong. What then &s;hall we &s;ay of the act 144. parl. 1592, appointing, <Q REND="inline">"That damage, intere&s;t, and expences of plea, be admitted by all judges, and li|quidated in the decree, whether condemnator or ab&s;olvitor?"</Q> If this regulation could ever be ju&s;t, it mu&s;t have been among a plain people, governed by a few &s;imple rules of law, &s;uppo&s;ed to be univer|&s;ally known. Law, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, is too intricate to admit a pre|&s;umption that every per&s;on who goes again&s;t it is <HI>in mala fide;</HI> and yet, unle&s;s <HI>mala fides</HI> be pre&s;umed in every ca&s;e, the regulation cannot be ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>Taking it now for granted, that, ab&s;tracting from a paction, co&s;ts of &s;uit cannot be claimed, otherwi&s;e than upon the medium of liti|gio&s;ity, I proceed in my inquiry. And I begin with examining, whether it be lawful to &s;tipulate damages upon the obligor's failure to perform, not even excepting an innocent failure. To bring this que&s;tion near the eye, I put a plain ca&s;e. A man is willing to lend his money at common intere&s;t: but in&s;i&s;ts, that if he be put to any expence in recovering payment, the borrower, who occa&s;ions this ex|pence, &s;hall be liable for it; and the borrower agrees to take the mo|ney
<PB N="282" REF="291">
upon that condition. Is this paction one of tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive pro|vi&s;ions, again&s;t which the debtor will be relieved in equity? I can|not di&s;cover any inju&s;tice in the paction, nor any oppre&s;&s;ion. A pac|tion of this nature, &s;o far from being unju&s;t or oppre&s;&s;ive, appears to be a natural con&s;equence from the law again&s;t u&s;ury. Where a man is permitted to take what intere&s;t he can for his money, a high intere&s;t may be held &s;ufficient to counterbalance what may be expended in recovering payment: but where the creditor is li|mited to a certain rate of intere&s;t, it &s;eems intended by the legi&s;lature, that he &s;hould in all events be &s;ecure of that intere&s;t, without being forc'd to expend it, and perhaps more, upon recovering the very &s;um he lent. Where-ever this happens, the creditor, in&s;tead of the common rate of intere&s;t, receives no intere&s;t at all; and mu&s;t be &s;atisfied to receive back a &s;um, that, in effect, has all along been barren.</P>
<P>An inquiry here into what is lawful, &s;mooths the road in our pre|&s;ent progre&s;s. If the paction above mentioned be lawful, we cannot he&s;itate in pre&s;uming that every creditor will take advantage of it; and con&s;equently, that this paction mu&s;t be implied in the penal clau&s;e contained in our bonds of borrowed money. To confine the meaning of this penal clau&s;e to a culpable failure, is truly to de|&s;troy the effect of it altogether; for a culpable failure &s;ubjects the debtor to damages at common law, independent of the clau&s;e. Nor can we doubt that the meaning of the clau&s;e is as above &s;et forth, when we &s;ee the &s;ame meaning given to a penal clau&s;e in England and in old Rome.</P>
<P>That the penalty in our bonds of borrowed money is incurred e|ven by an innocent failure, appears, not only from the pre&s;umed will of the parties, but al&s;o from the inveterate practice of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion in mitigating the&s;e penalties, which would be again&s;t e|quity &s;uppo&s;ing the failure to be criminal or culpable. I urge, in the next place, that the failure of a debtor to pay at the term cove|nanted, mu&s;t <HI>in dubio</HI> be held innocent till the contrary be proved. This is a legal privilege, common to a debtor with the re&s;t of man|kind. Hence it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that if the clau&s;e under con&s;ide|ration be confined to culpable failure, a charge of horning cannot pa&s;s for the penalty, till it be proved in a proce&s;s, that the failure is culpable. Here is a vexing dilemma: if culpable failure be the mean|ing of the clau&s;e, the practice of charging for the penalty as &s;oon as the term of payment is pa&s;t, mu&s;t be given up as irregular and ille|gal, though acquie&s;ced in for centuries without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition:
<PB N="283" REF="292">
on the other hand, if it be admitted, as it mu&s;t be, that this practice is agreeable to law, it follows nece&s;&s;arily, that a conventional penalty is incurred by innocent as well as by culpable failure.</P>
<P>Add the following ob&s;ervation. Where a bond &s;tipulating intere&s;t after the term of payment is &s;u&s;pended, and the letters found order|ly proceeded, after an intricate and doubtful litigation of many years, no lawyer ever dreamed that the &s;u&s;pender's <HI>bona fides</HI> will relieve him from intere&s;t. And yet it will puzzle the able&s;t lawyer to &s;ay, where the difference lies in this ca&s;e between intere&s;t and co&s;ts of &s;uit: if a plau&s;ible defence prevent the &s;tipulated penalty from being in|curred, it ought al&s;o to prevent the &s;tipulated intere&s;t from being incurred. Both are due <HI>ex contractu</HI> upon the failure of payment; and if there be any rea&s;on for barring innocent failure in the paction for the penalty, there is the &s;ame rea&s;on for barring it in the paction for intere&s;t. If there be a difference, the penalty re&s;tricted to co&s;ts of &s;uit is the more favourable claim: it is money out of the creditor's pocket; it is <HI>damnum datum;</HI> whereas the claim for intere&s;t is only <HI>lucrum ce&s;&s;ans.</HI> With re&s;pect to the Engli&s;h double bond, this argu|ment concludes beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of cavil; the penal &s;tipulation being the only foundation for claiming intere&s;t, as well as for claim|ing co&s;ts.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it &s;hall now be taken for granted, that in a bond of borrowed money the penal &s;um is incurred by innocent as well as by culpable failure. In the latter ca&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>culpa</HI> clearly proved, equity pleads not for a mitigation: in the former, equity requires a mitigation, as far as the &s;tipulation is truly penal; that is, as far as the penal &s;um exceeds the damage occa&s;ioned to the creditor by the delay of payment. This mitigation ari&s;es nece&s;|&s;arily from the rule above mentioned, <Q REND="inline">"He that demands equity mu&s;t give equity."</Q> And hence, in innocent failure, the practice is to mitigate the penalty to the co&s;ts of &s;uit, and to what other damage is clearly a&s;certained. This, at the &s;ame time, by putting the creditor in the &s;ame condition as if punctual payment had been made, fulfils all the intention he could fairly have in &s;tipulating a penalty.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. What effect, with re&s;pect to heirs, has the death of the obligee or legatee before or after the term of payment?</HEAD>
<P>IF the obligee's heirs be named in the obligation, they will &s;ucceed whether he die before or after the term of payment, becau&s;e &s;uch is the will of parties. The pre&s;ent que&s;tion relates to obliga|tions where the obligee's heirs are not named. Such obligations by the common law tran&s;mit not to heirs; becau&s;e the common law re|gards what is &s;aid to be the only proof of will: but equity is not &s;o peremptory nor &s;uperficial. It con&s;iders, that in human affairs er|rors and omi&s;&s;ions are frequent, and that words are not always to be ab&s;olutely relied on: it holds indeed words to be the be&s;t evi|dence of will, but not to be the only evidence. If therefore any &s;u&s;picion lie, that the will is not preci&s;ely what is expre&s;&s;ed, every rational circum&s;tance is laid hold of to a&s;certain, with all the accu|racy po&s;&s;ible, what really was the will of the granter, or of the con|tracters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 122.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to this point, the cau&s;e of the obligation is one capi|tal circum&s;tance. A gratuitous obligation has no cau&s;e but the will merely of the granter; and therefore an heir cannot claim upon &s;uch obligation, unle&s;s he can &s;how the will of the granter to be in his fa|vour; which will be no ea&s;y ta&s;k if he be not named in the deed. Thus a gratuitous promi&s;e to give a &s;um to Titius at a day certain, without mentioning heirs, will be ineffectual if Titius die before the term of payment: the heir of Titius has no claim either at common law or in equity.</P>
<P>But what if Titius, &s;urviving the term, die without obtaining payment? His heir has no claim at common law, becau&s;e he is not named in the obligation; but he has a good claim in equity: with re&s;pect to the obligor, it being his duty to make payment at the term &s;tipulated, ju&s;tice will not &s;uffer him to make profit by his ob|&s;tinacy or neglect: with re&s;pect to the obligee, being intitled to the &s;um at the term &s;tipulated, he mu&s;t not be forfeited by the failure of the obligor. Equity therefore affords an action to his heir for payment,
<PB N="285" REF="294">
which relieves from the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained at common law by the failure of payment.</P>
<P>On the other hand, an obligation for a valuable con&s;ideration is in its nature perpetual, and ought in all events to be fulfilled. Such mu&s;t be pre&s;umed the intention of parties, in every engagement that is not purely an exerci&s;e of benevolence. An obligor accordingly who has received a valuable con&s;ideration, mu&s;t, in all events, per|form his part of the engagement, unle&s;s the contrary be &s;tipulated: the obligee's death, in particular, before the term of payment, will not relieve the obligor, though the obligee's heirs be not named in the deed. The common law, it is true, affords not to the heir an action in this ca&s;e more than where the obligation is gratuitous: but equi|ty, &s;upplying the defects of common law, affords an action, in or|der to fulfil the rules of ju&s;tice, which will not &s;uffer the valuable con&s;ideration to remain with the obligor without performing the e|quivalent pactioned. Hence, with re&s;pect to the point under con&s;i|deration, an obligation for a valuable con&s;ideration is directly oppo|&s;ite to that which is gratuitous. In the former, the heir takes unle&s;s he be expre&s;sly excluded: in the latter, the heir takes not unle&s;s he be expre&s;sly included. Thus a bond for borrowed money, though taken in the creditor's name &s;olely, will go to his heir, even where he dies before the term of payment.</P>
<P>Men are bound to educate their children till they be able to gain a livelihood for them&s;elves; and any further provi&s;ion is under&s;tood to be gratuitous. Hence a bond of provi&s;ion to children is deemed a gra|tuitous deed; and for that rea&s;on, if the children die before the term of payment, equity gives no aid to their heirs. If heirs be named in the bond, they have right at common law: if not named, neither equity nor common law gives them right. Thus, in a contract of marriage certain provi&s;ions being allotted to the children, the portions of the males payable at their age of twenty-one years, and of the females at eighteen, without mentioning heirs or a&s;&s;ignees; the a&s;&s;ignees and creditors of &s;ome of the children who died before the term of pay|ment, were judged to have no right <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, January 17. 1665, Edgar contra Edgar.</NOTE>. I cannot &s;o readily acquie&s;ce in the following deci&s;ion, where a bond of provi&s;ion payable to a daughter at her age of fourteen, and to her heirs executors and a&s;|&s;ignees, was voided by her death before the term of payment <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, February 22. 1677, Bel&s;ches contra Bel&s;ches.</NOTE>. The addition of <HI>heirs executors and a&s;&s;ignees&punc;</HI> was thought to regard the child's death after the term of payment; and not to be an in|dication
<PB N="286" REF="295">
of the granter's will that the bond &s;hould be effectual though the child died before the term of payment. The clau&s;e, I admit, is capable of that re&s;tricted meaning: but I can find no cau&s;e for this re&s;triction; and in all ca&s;es it is &s;afe&s;t to give words their natural import, unle&s;s it be made extremely clear that the granter's meaning was different. And accordingly Chalmers having &s;ettled his e&s;tate upon his nephew, with the burden of a &s;um certain to I&s;abel Inglis, wife of David Millar, and to her heirs executors, or a&s;&s;ignees, payable year and day after his death, with intere&s;t af|ter the term of payment; and I&s;abel having died before Chalmers, leaving a &s;on who &s;urvived him; the &s;um was decreed to that &s;on as a conditional in&s;titute <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Millar contra Inglis, July 16. 1760.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Even a bond of provi&s;ion, or any gratuitous deed, will de&s;cend to heirs, as above &s;aid, if &s;uch was the granter's intention. Nor is it nece&s;&s;ary in equity that &s;uch intention be expre&s;&s;ed in words: it is &s;uf|ficient that it be made evident from circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>What is &s;aid above &s;eems a more clear and conclu&s;ive rea&s;on for excluding heirs where the creditor in a bond of provi&s;ion dies be|fore the term of payment, than what is commonly a&s;&s;igned, <HI>viz.</HI> that the &s;um in the bond, being de&s;tined as a &s;tock for the child, cea&s;es to be due, &s;ince it cannot an&s;wer the purpo&s;e for which it was intended. Were this rea&s;on good, it would hold equally whether the child die before or after the term of payment; and therefore in pro|ving too much it proves nothing.</P>
<P>In what ca&s;es a legatee tran&s;mits a legacy to his heirs, is a que&s;tion that takes in a great variety of matter. To have a di&s;tinct notion of this que&s;tion, legacies mu&s;t be divided into their different kinds. I begin with the legacy of a <HI>corpus.</HI> The property here is transferred to the legatee <HI>ip&s;o jure</HI> upon the te&s;tator's death. The rea&s;on is, that will &s;olely mu&s;t in this ca&s;e have the effect to transfer property, o|therwi&s;e it could never be transferred from the dead to the living: a proprietor after his death cannot make delivery; and no other per|&s;on but the proprietor can make a legal delivery. Now if the legatee be ve&s;ted in the property of the &s;ubject legated, it mu&s;t upon his death de&s;cend to his heirs even by common law.</P>
<P>But what if the legatee die before the te&s;tator? In this ca&s;e the legacy is void. The te&s;tator remains proprietor till his death, and the &s;ubject legated cannot by his death be transferred to a per&s;on who is no longer in exi&s;tence. Nor can it be transferred to that per|&s;on's
<PB N="287" REF="296">
heirs, becau&s;e the te&s;tator did not exert any act of will in their favour.</P>
<P>The next ca&s;e I put is of a &s;um of money legated to Titius. A le|gacy of this &s;ort, giving the legatee an intere&s;t in the te&s;tator's per&s;o|nal e&s;tate, and intitling him to a proportion, ve&s;ts in the legatee <HI>ip&s;o jure</HI> upon the te&s;tator's death. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on that is given above, the legacy even at common law will tran&s;mit to heirs, if the legatee &s;urvive the te&s;tator; if not, it will be void. But what if the legacy be ordered to be paid at a certain term? It mu&s;t be con|&s;idered, whether the term be added for the benefit of the te&s;tator's heir, in order to give him time for preparing the money; or whether it be added as a limitation upon the legacy. A term for payment given to the te&s;tator's heir, will not alter the nature of the legacy, nor prevent its ve&s;ting in the legatee upon the te&s;tator's death; and con|&s;equently &s;uch a legacy will tran&s;mit to heirs, even where the legatee dies before the term of payment, provided he &s;urvive the te&s;tator. <HI>Dies cedit et&s;i non venerit.</HI> But where the purpo&s;e of naming a term for payment is to limit the legacy, the legatee's death before that term will bar his heirs, becau&s;e he him&s;elf had never any right. Here <HI>dies nec cedit nec venit.</HI> In order to a&s;certain the intention of the te&s;tator in naming a day for payment, the rule laid down by Pa|pinian is judicious: <HI>Dies incertus conditionem in te&s;tamento facit</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 75. De condition. et demon.</NOTE>. A day certain for performance is commonly added in favour of the te|&s;tator's heir, in order to give him time for providing the money. An uncertain term re&s;pects generally the condition of the legatee, as where a legacy is in favour of a boy to be claimed when he arrives at eighteen years of age, or of a girl to be claimed at her marriage: in &s;uch in&s;tances, it appears to be the will of the te&s;tator, that the lega|cy &s;hall not ve&s;t before the term of payment. The <HI>dies incertus</HI> is &s;aid to make the legacy conditional; not properly &s;peaking, for the na|ming a day of payment, certain or uncertain, is not a condition. But as the uncertain term for payment has the effect to limit the le|gacy in the &s;ame manner as if it were conditional; for that rea&s;on, the uncertain term is &s;aid to imply a condition, or to make the lega|cy conditional.</P>
<P>A third &s;ort of legacy is where the te&s;tator burdens his heir to pay a certain &s;um to Titius &s;ingly, without the addition of heirs. The heirs, by the common law, have no right even where Titius &s;urvives the te&s;tator, becau&s;e there is not here, as in the former ca&s;es, any
<PB N="288" REF="297">
&s;ubject ve&s;ted in Titius to de&s;cend of cour&s;e to his heirs; not can heirs, by the common law, claim upon an obligation which is not in their favour. But equity &s;u&s;tains an action to them: for no day being named, the death of the te&s;tator is the term of payment; and equity will not &s;uffer the te&s;tator's heir to profit by delaying payment. Where a term of payment is added by the te&s;tator, the ca&s;e becomes the &s;ame with that of a gratuitous obligation <HI>inter vivos.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Arre&s;tment and proce&s;s of forthcoming.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH a creditor cannot be forc'd to receive any &s;ubject for payment of his debt other than current &s;pecie; yet &s;ometimes he agrees to take &s;atisfaction in goods; and &s;ometimes, for want of ready money, he is put off with a &s;ecurity, an a&s;&s;ignment to rents, for example, or to debts, which impowers him to draw his payment out of the&s;e funds belonging to his debtor. Legal execution, copy|ing a creditor's private acts, is clearly di&s;tingui&s;hable into three kinds. The fir&s;t, by forcing payment of the debt, re&s;embles as to its effect voluntary payment. This was the ca&s;e of poinding as framed originally <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torical law-tracts, tract 10.</NOTE>: and is the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent of a forthcoming of moveables, as will appear from the following analy&s;is. A debtor's moveables in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion are attached by poinding, corre&s;ponding to the <HI>Le|vari facies</HI> in England: but where the&s;e moveables are in cu&s;tody of any other, and the particulars unknown, there is no opportunity for poinding: they are attached by a proce&s;s of forthcoming again&s;t the cu&s;todier or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; in which proce&s;s, the moveables attached are &s;old by authority of the court, the price is delivered to the creditor for his payment, and the debt is thereby extingui&s;hed in whole or in part.</P>
<P>The &s;econd re&s;embles voluntary acceptance of fungibles for &s;atis|fying the debt; which is the ca&s;e of poinding as modelled in our later practice. The goods are not &s;old as originally, but only valued and delivered <HI>ip&s;a corpora</HI> to the creditor for &s;atisfying the debt upon which the execution proceeds.</P>
<P>The third re&s;embles a voluntary &s;ecurity; for it proceeds no far|ther than to give a &s;ecurity upon the debtor's funds, leaving the cre|ditor
<PB N="289" REF="298">
to operate his payment by virtue of the &s;ecurity. This is the ca&s;e of an adjudication during the legal, which impowers the credi|tor to draw his payment out of the debtor's rents, provided the te|nants be willing to pay: if refractory, they may be compelled by a decree again&s;t them per&s;onally for their rents. This decree, termed <HI>a decreet of mails and duties,</HI> completes the &s;ecurity, by giving direct ac|ce&s;s to the debtor's tenants. A decree for making forthcoming &s;ums of money due to the debtor, is of the &s;ame nature; being a &s;ecurity only, not payment: and &s;uch a decree may be ju&s;tly defined a power given to the creditor to draw payment from the debtors of his debtor. What follows to complete the proce&s;s may be done by private con|&s;ent: the per&s;on again&s;t whom the decree of forthcoming is obtained ought to pay without further compul&s;ion; and payment thus obtained voluntarily, extingui&s;hes the debt upon which the forthcoming is founded. In a word, a decree of forthcoming obtained by my credi|tor again&s;t my debtor, re&s;embles in every circum&s;tance an order by me upon my debtor, to deliver the &s;um he owes me to my creditor for &s;a|tisfying the debt I owe him: a decree of forthcoming is a judicial or|der, having the &s;ame effect with a voluntary order. Hence it clearly follows, that if my debtor, again&s;t whom the decree of forthcoming is obtained, prove in&s;olvent, the &s;um is lo&s;t to me, not to my credi|tor: his &s;ecurity indeed is gone, but the debt which was &s;ecured re|mains entire.</P>
<P>A judicial order to &s;ecure a moveable &s;ubject, whether a per&s;on or goods, till it be di&s;po&s;ed of by legal authority, is &s;tyled, <HI>an arre&s;t|ment.</HI> Per&s;ons accu&s;ed of crimes are arre&s;ted to prevent their flying or ab&s;conding. When the property of moveables is di&s;puted, they are arre&s;ted in the hands of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or till the property be a&s;certain|ed. This arre&s;tment, termed <HI>rei &s;ervandae cau&s;a,</HI> is a &s;pecies of &s;eque|&s;tration: it is a &s;eque&s;tration in the hands of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, in&s;tead of a &s;eque&s;tration <HI>in manibus curiae.</HI> It hath its full effect, by &s;ecuring the controverted &s;ubject till the property be a&s;certained; and when the property is a&s;certained, the proprietor takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion <HI>via facti,</HI> with|out nece&s;&s;ity of a proce&s;s of forthcoming. A third &s;ort of arre&s;tment is preparatory to a proce&s;s of forthcoming, rai&s;ed by a creditor for drawing his payment out of his debtor's moveable funds; and this &s;ort only is propo&s;ed to be handled in the pre&s;ent chapter.</P>
<P>When a creditor &s;u&s;pects that his debtor has goods not in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he obtains a warrant or order from a proper court to arre&s;t them in the hands of the cu&s;todier; and this order &s;erved upon the cu&s;todier, makes him an&s;werable for the&s;e goods, when they are de|manded
<PB N="290" REF="299">
by the creditor in a proce&s;s of forthcoming. The &s;ervice of this order is termed <HI>an arre&s;tment,</HI> and the per&s;on upon whom it is &s;erved is termed <HI>the arre&s;tee.</HI> Sums due to the debtor may be arre&s;ted in the &s;ame manner. An arre&s;tment of this kind is not, properly &s;peaking, a &s;tep of execution; for goods or debts may be made forthcoming for &s;atisfying the creditor without u&s;ing an arre&s;tment: it is only a prepa|ratory &s;tep u&s;ed by a cautious creditor, for &s;ecuring the &s;ubject in the hands of the arre&s;tee till a proce&s;s of forthcoming be rai&s;ed. In this re&s;pect, an arre&s;tment is preci&s;ely &s;imilar to an inhibition, which, properly &s;peaking, is not a &s;tep of execution, but only an injunction to the debtor, prohibiting him to alien his land, or to contract debt; and the effect of this prohibition is to pre&s;erve the fund entire to the creditor when he proceeds to adjudge. Adjudications are carried on every day without a preparatory inhibition; and in the &s;ame manner may a proce&s;s of forthcoming be carried on without a preparatory ar|re&s;tment.</P>
<P>The&s;e things &s;hortly premi&s;ed, I come to what is chiefly intended in this chapter, which is to explain the operations of common law and of equity with re&s;pect to an arre&s;tment, when it is brought in competition with other rights voluntary or legal. All writers are a|greed about the effect given by common law to an arre&s;tment of moveable goods; which being, as above ob&s;erved, a &s;eque&s;tration in the hands of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, transfers not the property to the creditor. The goods &s;ecured by the arre&s;tment are, in the proce&s;s of forthco|ming, &s;old as the property of the debtor, and the price is applied for payment of the debt due by him to his creditor the arre&s;ter. For this rea&s;on, an arre&s;tment cannot bar a poinding carried on by another creditor: the common law, authori&s;ing execution, con&s;iders only whether the &s;ubject propo&s;ed to be attached belong to the debtor; and if it be his property, execution proceeds of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The effect of an arre&s;tment attaching &s;ums of money due to the ar|re&s;ter's debtor, has been much controverted; and in order to clear that point, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to take an accurate &s;urvey of &s;uch arre&s;tment in all its parts. The letter or warrant for arre&s;tment, to which the arre&s;tment it&s;elf is entirely conformable, is in the follow|ing words: <Q REND="inline">"To fence and arre&s;t all and &s;undry the &s;aid A. B. his readie&s;t goods, gear, debts, &amp;c. in who&s;oever hands the &s;ame can be apprehended, to remain under &s;ure fence and arre&s;tment, at the in&s;tance of the &s;aid complainer, ay and while payment be made to him."</Q> Upon this warrant, and arre&s;tment following upon it, it will be ob&s;erved, fir&s;t, That no per&s;on is named but the arre&s;ter and
<PB N="291" REF="300">
his debtor. It is not a limited warrant to arre&s;t in the hands of any particular per&s;on; but authori&s;es the creditor to arre&s;t in the hands of any per&s;on that he &s;u&s;pects may owe money to his debtor. Se|condly, The arre&s;tee is not ordered or authori&s;ed to make payment to the arre&s;ter: the order he receives, is to keep the money in his hand till the arre&s;ter be &s;atisfied. The&s;e particulars make it plain, that an arre&s;tment, like an inhibition, is merely prohibitory; and that it transfers not any right to the arre&s;ter, which would be a po&s;itive ef|fect. And this point is put out of doubt by the &s;ummons of forth|coming, concluding, <Q REND="inline">"That the defender &s;hould be decerned and or|dained to make forthcoming to the complainer the &s;um of re&s;ting and owing by him to A. B. (the complainer's debtor again&s;t whom the execution pa&s;&s;es), and arre&s;ted in the defender's hands at the complainer's in&s;tance."</Q> A decree of forthcoming, therefore, as above ob&s;erved, is a &s;pecies of execution, intitling the creditor to draw his payment out of &s;ums due to his debtor. It is the decree of forth|coming that gives a &s;ecurity to the creditor upon the &s;um arre&s;ted due to his debtor; and the preparatory arre&s;tment has no other effect, but to afford an interim &s;ecurity to prevent alienation before the proce&s;s of forthcoming be rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>If it hold true, that arre&s;tment is prohibitory only, and that my creditor arre&s;ting in the hands of my debtor, hath no right to the &s;um arre&s;ted till he obtain a decree of forthcoming; it follows upon the principles of common law, that this &s;um, belonging to me after arre&s;tment as well as before, lies open to be attached by my other creditors; and that, in a competition among the&s;e creditors, all of them arre&s;ters, the fir&s;t decree of forthcoming mu&s;t give preference. For the fir&s;t order &s;erved upon my debtor binds him to the creditor who obtained the order; after which he cannot legally pay to any o|ther. Thus &s;tands the common law, which is followed out in a cour&s;e of deci&s;ions, mo&s;tly of an old date, giving preference, not to the fir&s;t arre&s;tment, but to the fir&s;t decree of forthcoming.</P>
<P>Whether equity make any variation &s;hall be our next inquiry. It is the privilege of a debtor, with re&s;pect to his own funds, to chu&s;e what of them he will apply for payment of his debts. Upon the debtor's failure, this choice is transferred to the creditor, who may attach any particular &s;ubject for his payment. In that ca&s;e, the debtor is in duty bound to &s;urrender to his creditor the &s;ubject attach|ed, by conveying it to him for his &s;ecurity. It is undoubtedly the duty of the debtor to relieve his creditor from the trouble and expence of execution; and, con&s;equently, to relieve him from execution again&s;t
<PB N="292" REF="301">
any particular &s;ubject, by &s;urrendering it voluntarily, unle&s;s he find other means of making payment. The creditor's privilege to attach any particular &s;ubject for his payment, and the debtor's relative obli|gation to &s;ave execution by &s;urrendering that &s;ubject to his creditor, are indeed the foundation of all execution. A judge authori&s;ing exe|cution, &s;upplies only the place of the debtor; and con&s;equently can|not authori&s;e execution again&s;t any particular &s;ubject, unle&s;s the debtor be antecedently bound to &s;urrender the &s;ame to his creditor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 221.</NOTE>. This branch of the debtor's duty explains clearly a rule in law, <Q REND="inline">"That inchoated execution makes the &s;ubject litigious, and ties up the debtor's hands from aliening."</Q> If it be his duty to prevent execu|tion by &s;urrendering this &s;ubject to his creditor, it is incon&s;i&s;tent with his duty to di&s;po&s;e of it for any other purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In applying the rules of equity to an arre&s;tment, the duty now un|folded will be found of importance. If the debtor ought to convey to his creditor the &s;ubject arre&s;ted by him, no other creditor who knows the debtor to be &s;o bound, can ju&s;tly attach that &s;ubject by legal execution: for it is unju&s;t to demand from a debtor privately, or even by legal execution, any &s;ubject that he is bound to convey to another <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">ibid.</NOTE>. And if a creditor &s;hall act thus unju&s;tly, by arre&s;ting a &s;ubject which he knows to be already arre&s;ted by another creditor, a court of equity will di&s;appoint the effect of the &s;econd arre&s;tment, by giving preference to the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Our writers, though they have not clearly unfolded the foregoing obligation which the debtor is under to the fir&s;t arre&s;ter, have, how|ever, been &s;en&s;ible of it; for it is obviou&s;ly with reference to this ob|ligation, that an arre&s;tment is &s;aid to make a <HI>nexus realis</HI> upon the &s;ubject. I know but of two ways by which a man can be connected with a debt: one is where he has the <HI>jus exigendi,</HI> and one where the creditor is bound to make it over to him. It will be admitted, that an arre&s;tment has not the effect of transferring to the arre&s;ter the debt ar|re&s;ted: the arre&s;ter has not even the <HI>jus exigendi</HI> till he obtain a decree of forthcoming. And if &s;o, a <HI>nexus realis,</HI> applied to the pre&s;ent &s;ub|ject, cannot import other than the obligation which the creditor is un|der to make over the debt to the arre&s;ter. Thus, by the principles of equity, the fir&s;t arre&s;tment is preferable while the &s;ubject is <HI>in medio;</HI> but if a po&s;terior arre&s;ter, without notice of a former, obtain payment upon a decree of forthcoming, he is &s;ecure in equity, as well as at common law; and his di&s;covery afterward of a prior arre&s;tment will not oblige him to repay the money <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 224.</NOTE>. This equitable rule of prefer|ence
<PB N="293" REF="302">
is accordingly e&s;tabli&s;hed at pre&s;ent, and all the late deci&s;ions of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion proceed upon it.</P>
<P>An arre&s;tment, as ob&s;erved above, hath not the effect at common law to bar poinding; but in equity, for the rea&s;on now given, an arre&s;tment made known to the poinder, ought to bar him from pro|ceeding in his execution, as well as it bars a po&s;terior arre&s;tment. A creditor ought not, by any &s;ort of execution, to force from his debtor what the debtor cannot hone&s;tly convey to him. And yet, though in ranking arre&s;tments the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion follows the rules of equity, it acts as a court of common law in permitting a &s;ubject to be poind|ed after it is arre&s;ted by another creditor. I &s;hall clo&s;e this branch of my &s;ubject with a general ob&s;ervation, That the equitable rules e&s;ta|bli&s;hed above, hold only where the debtor is &s;olvent: it will be &s;een afterward, that in the ca&s;e of bankruptcy, all per&s;onal creditors ought to draw equally.</P>
<P>So much about arre&s;ters competing for the &s;ame debt. Next a|bout an arre&s;ter competing with an a&s;&s;ignce for a valuable con&s;idera|tion. Touching this competition, one preliminary point mu&s;t be ac|curately adju&s;ted, <HI>viz.</HI> How far an arre&s;tment makes the &s;ubject ar|re&s;ted litigious; or, in other words, How far it bars voluntary deeds. It is obvious, in the fir&s;t place, that an arre&s;tment makes the &s;ubject litigious with re&s;pect to the arre&s;tee, becau&s;e it is &s;erved upon him: the very purpo&s;e of the arre&s;tment is, to prohibit him from making payment, or from giving up the goods of which he is cu&s;todier. In the next place, As a creditor may proceed to arre&s;tment without in|timating his purpo&s;e to his debtor, an arre&s;tment cannot bar the debtor's voluntary deeds, till it be notified to him: the arre&s;tment deprives him not of his <HI>jus crediti,</HI> nor of his property; and while he continues ignorant of the arre&s;tment, nothing bars him, either in law or in equity, from conveying his right to a third party. Upon that account, intimation to him is an e&s;tabli&s;hed practice in the coun|try from whence we borrowed an arre&s;tment: <Q REND="inline">"Quamvis debitor debitoris mei a me arre&s;tari nequeat, cum mihi nulla ex cau&s;a obli|gatus &s;it, tamen, quod Titius debitori meo debet, per judicem inhi|bere po&s;&s;um, ne debitori meo &s;olvatur, &s;ine mea vel judicis volun|tate. De quo arre&s;to debitorem meum certiorem facere debeo, ei|que diem dicere, quo &s;i compareat, nec ju&s;tam cau&s;am alleget, ob quam arre&s;tum relaxari debeat, vel &s;i non compareat, judex ex pe|cunia arre&s;tata mihi &s;olvendum decernet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sande Deci&s;.

The cedent aliens indeed <HI>mala fide</HI> after the arre&s;tment is notified to him; but the purcha&s;er is &s;ecure if he be <HI>in bona fide:</HI> the property is legally transferred to him; and there is nothing in law nor in equity to deprive a man of a &s;ubject hone&s;tly acquired. That an arre&s;tment makes not the &s;ubject litigious with regard to third parties&punc; will be clear from con&s;idering, that an effect &s;o &s;trong is never given to any act, unle&s;s there be a public notification: a proce&s;s in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion is &s;uppo&s;ed to be known to all; and, as it is a rule <HI>Quod nihil innovandum pendente lite,</HI> any per&s;on who tran&s;acts either with the plaintiff or defendant, &s;o as to hurt the other, does knowingly an unlawful act, which for that rea&s;on will be voided: an inhibition and interdiction are publi&s;hed to all the lieges, who are thereby put <HI>in mala fide</HI> to purcha&s;e from the per&s;on inhibited or interdicted: an appri&s;ing renders the &s;ubject litigious as to all, becau&s;e the letters are publicly proclaimed or denounced, not only upon the land, but al&s;o at the market-cro&s;s of the head-borough of the juri&s;diction where the land lies <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, lib. 3. tit. 2. &sect; 14.</NOTE>; and an adjudication has the &s;ame effect, becau&s;e it is a proce&s;s in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion: a charge of horning bars not the debtor from aliening, till he be publicly proclaimed or denounced rebel; and it mu&s;t be evident, that an arre&s;tment &s;erved again&s;t my debtor cannot hurt third parties dealing with me, more than a horn|ing again&s;t my&s;elf. In a word, litigio&s;ity, &s;o as to affect third par|ties, never takes place without public notification.</P>
<P>When one con&s;iders an inhibition, it will occur, that the argument here may be carried a great way farther; even &s;o far as that the actual knowledge of an arre&s;tment &s;hould not bar any per&s;on from purcha|&s;ing the &s;ubject arre&s;ted. But the argument from an inhibition con|cludes not with re&s;pect to an arre&s;tment; and in order to &s;how the difference, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate the nature of an inhibition in a hi&s;torical view.</P>
<P>This writ prohibits the alienation of moveable as well as of im|moveable &s;ubjects; and to &s;ecure again&s;t &s;uch alienation, the writ is publi&s;hed to the lieges, to put every man upon his guard again&s;t
<PB N="295" REF="304">
dealing with the per&s;on inhibited. This writ mu&s;t have been the in|vention of a frugal age, before the commerce of money was far ex|tended, and before inhibitions were frequent. While inhibitions were rare, their publication could be kept in remembrance; a debtor inhi|bited would be a remarkable per&s;on, and every one would avoid deal|ing with him: but when the commerce of money was farther extend|ed, and debts were multiplied, an inhibition was no longer a mark of di&s;tinction. And as inhibitions could no longer be kept in memory, they became a load upon the commerce of moveables pa&s;t all enduring; for no man was in &s;afety to purcha&s;e from his neighbour a hor&s;e, or a bu&s;hel of corn, till fir&s;t the records of inhibitions were con&s;ulted. A Lycurgus intending to bar commerce, in order to pre&s;erve his nation in poverty, could not have invented a more effectual &s;cheme. But this execution, incon&s;i&s;tent with commerce &s;o far as it affects move|ables, is al&s;o incon&s;i&s;tent in it&s;elf, tending in a mo&s;t direct manner to di&s;appoint its own end. The purpo&s;e of an inhibition is to force pay|ment; and the effect of it is to prevent payment, by locking up the debtor's moveables, which commonly are the only ready fund for pro|curing money.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons have prevailed upon the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion to deny any effect to an inhibition, &s;o far as it regards moveables. An inhibition indeed, with re&s;pect to its form and tenor, continues the &s;ame that it was originally; and accordingly every debtor inhibited is to this hour di&s;charged to alien his moveables, not le&s;s peremptorily than to alien his land. This is an incon&s;i&s;tency that cannot be remedied but by the legi&s;lature; for the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion cannot alter a writ of the common law, more than it can alter any other branch of the com|mon law. But the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, as a court of equity, can redre&s;s the rigor, inju&s;tice, or oppre&s;&s;ion, of the common law: and though it hath no power to alter the &s;tyle of an inhibition, it acts ju&s;tly in denying any force to an inhibition &s;o far as it affects moveables; be|cau&s;e &s;o far it is an oppre&s;&s;ive and incon&s;i&s;tent execution. This argu|ment, as above hinted, may &s;eem to apply to an arre&s;tment, that e|ven the knowledge of this execution ought not to bar any per&s;on from purcha&s;ing the &s;ubject arre&s;ted, whether it be a debt, or a move|able properly &s;o called. But this holds not in practice: and there is good rea&s;on for di&s;tingui&s;hing, in this particular, an arre&s;tment from an inhibition: the latter prohibits, in general, the debtor to alien any of his moveables, and for that rea&s;on is highly rigorous and oppre&s;|&s;ive: the former is of particular &s;ubjects only, nor doth it affect any
<PB N="296" REF="305">
moveables in the debtor's own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and for that rea&s;on, the execution &s;o limited is neither rigorous nor oppre&s;&s;ive. An arre&s;t|ment, therefore, as to the &s;ubjects affected by it, is allowed in practice to have the full effect that is given it by the common law. But with re&s;pect to a third party, it has a more ample effect in equity than at common law: for though a man who <HI>bona fide</HI> purcha&s;es a &s;ubject ar|re&s;ted, is &s;ecure in equity as well as at common law; yet a <HI>mala fide</HI> purcha&s;e, though effectual at common law, will undoubtedly be void|ed in a court of equity.</P>
<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed preliminary points, we proceed to the &s;ubject pro|po&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> the competition between an arre&s;ter and an a&s;&s;ignee. I begin with an arre&s;tment of a moveable bond, a&s;&s;ign'd before the ar|re&s;tment, but intimated after. The intimation by our law makes a complete conveyance of the bond into the per&s;on of the a&s;&s;ignee, af|ter which it is in vain to think of making the debt forthcoming to the arre&s;ter for his payment: the very foundation of his claim is gone; for neither law nor equity will permit any &s;ubject to be taken in exe|cution that belongs not to the debtor. Many deci&s;ions, it is true, prefer the arre&s;ter; upon what medium, I cannot comprehend. Our deci&s;ions, however, are far from being uniform upon this point. I give the following example. A a&s;&s;igns the rent of his land for &s;ecu|rity and payment of a debt due by him. A hath another creditor who afterward rai&s;es a proce&s;s of adjudication again&s;t the &s;ame land. The a&s;&s;ignee intimating his right after the citation, but before the de|cree of adjudication, is preferred before the adjudger <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, March 2. 1637, Smith contra Hepburn.</NOTE>. An arre&s;t|ment &s;urely makes not a &s;tronger <HI>nexus</HI> upon the &s;ubject than is made by a citation upon a &s;ummons of adjudication; and if an a&s;&s;ignment be preferred before the latter, it mu&s;t al&s;o be preferred before the for|mer. But I &s;ay more. Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that after the citation upon the &s;ummons of adjudication, but before intimation of the a&s;&s;ignment, the mails and duties are arre&s;ted by a third creditor. The decree of adjudication is preferred before the arre&s;tment <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple, June 26. 1705, Stewart contra Stewart.</NOTE>. If &s;o, here is a circle ab&s;olutely inextricable, an adjudication preferred before an ar|re&s;tment, that arre&s;tment before an a&s;&s;ignment, and that a&s;&s;ignment again before the adjudication. This proves demon&s;trably that the a&s;&s;ignee ought to be preferred before the arre&s;ter as well as before the adjudger. The court went &s;till farther in preferring an a&s;&s;ignee be|fore an arre&s;ter. An Engli&s;h a&s;&s;ignment to this day is a procuratory <HI>in rem &s;uam</HI> only, carrying the equitable right indeed, but not the legal right. And yet with re&s;pect to a bond due to Wil&s;on re&s;iding
<PB N="297" REF="306">
in England by the Earl of Rothes in Scotland, an Engli&s;h a&s;&s;ignment by Wil&s;on of the &s;aid bond was of it&s;elf, without intimation, prefer|red before an arre&s;tment &s;erved afterward upon the Earl. The prefer|ence thus given was clearly founded on equity; becau&s;e the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, as a court of equity, could not ju&s;tly make forthcoming to a creditor of Wil&s;on for his payment, a &s;ubject that Wil&s;on had aliened for a valuable con&s;ideration, and to which the purcha&s;er had the equi|table though not the legal right. But if this be a ju&s;t deci&s;ion, which it undoubtedly is, nothing can be more unju&s;t, than to prefer an ar|re&s;tment before a Scotch a&s;&s;ignment of a prior date, even after it is completed by intimation; for here the a&s;&s;ignee has both the equitable and legal right.</P>
<P>The next ca&s;e I put, is where in a proce&s;s of forthcoming upon an arre&s;tment, an a&s;&s;ignee appears with an a&s;&s;ignment prior to the ar|re&s;tment, but not intimated. I have already given my rea&s;on for preferring the a&s;&s;ignee, as the court did with re&s;pect to an Engli&s;h a&s;&s;ignment: and yet the ordinary practice is to prefer the arre&s;tment; which one will have no he&s;itation to believe, when an arre&s;tment is preferred even where the a&s;&s;ignment is intimated.</P>
<P>The preference due to the a&s;&s;ignee is in this ca&s;e &s;o clear, that I am encouraged to carry the doctrine farther, by preferring an a&s;&s;ignee e|ven before a poinder, provided the a&s;&s;ignee appear for his intere&s;t be|fore the poinding be completed. The poinder no doubt is preferable at common law, becau&s;e the a&s;&s;ignment not being completed by inti|mation, the debtor continues &s;till proprietor. The a&s;&s;ignee however has the equitable right, and ju&s;tice will not permit goods that the debtor has aliened for a valuable con&s;ideration to be attached by any of his creditors. The re&s;ult will be different, where the poinding is completed, and the property of the goods transferred to the creditor, before the a&s;&s;ignee appear. In this ca&s;e the poinder is &s;ecure, be|cau&s;e no man can be forfeited of his property who has committed no fault.</P>
<P>I proceed to an a&s;&s;ignment of a debt made after the arre&s;tment, and intimated before the competition. Suppo&s;ing the a&s;&s;ignee to be <HI>in bona fide,</HI> he is clearly preferable; for the intimation ve&s;ts in him the legal as well as equitable right, which bars ab&s;olutely the cedent and his creditors: and this rea&s;on is good at common law to prefer the a&s;&s;ignee, even &s;uppo&s;ing he had notice of the arre&s;tment before he took the a&s;&s;ignment. But in equity the arre&s;ter is preferable where the a&s;&s;ignee is <HI>in mala fide,</HI> for the following rea&s;on. The debtor, after his &s;ubject is affected by an arre&s;tment, is bound in duty to make o|ver
<PB N="298" REF="307">
the &s;ubject to his creditor the arre&s;ter: if he tran&s;gre&s;s this duty by conveying the &s;ubject to one who knows of the arre&s;tment, both are guilty of a moral wrong, which equity will redre&s;s by preferring the arre&s;ter.</P>
<P>Let us drop now the intimation, by putting the ca&s;e, that, in a pro|ce&s;s of forthcoming at the in&s;tance of an arre&s;ter, an a&s;&s;ignee appears for his intere&s;t, craving preference upon an a&s;&s;ignment bearing date af|ter the arre&s;tment, but before the citation in the proce&s;s of forthco|ming. Suppo&s;ing the a&s;&s;ignee <HI>in mala fide,</HI> he will in equity be po&s;t|poned to the arre&s;ter for the rea&s;on immediately above given. But what &s;hall be the rule of preference where the a&s;&s;ignee purcha&s;es <HI>bona fide?</HI> The arre&s;ter and he have each of them an equitable right to the &s;ubject; neither of them has the legal right. This ca&s;e re&s;embles that of &s;tellionate, where a proprietor of land &s;ells to two different purcha&s;ers ignorant of each other: neither of whom has the legal right, becau&s;e there is no infeftment; but each of them has an equi|table right. In the&s;e ca&s;es I cannot di&s;cover a rule for preference; nor can I extricate the matter otherwi&s;e than by dividing the &s;ubject between the competitors. And after all, whether this may not be cutting the Gordian knot in&s;tead of untying it, I pretend not to be certain.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, an arre&s;tment appears a very precarious &s;ecurity till a proce&s;s of forthcoming be commenced. This proce&s;s indeed is a notification to the debtor not to alien in prejudice of the arre&s;ter, and at the &s;ame time a public notification to the lieges not to purcha&s;e the &s;ubject arre&s;ted. And by this proce&s;s the &s;ubject is rendered liti|gious, though the &s;ame privilege is not indulged to an inhibition &s;o far as moveables are concerned.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Powers of a court of equity with relation to bankrupts.</HEAD>
<P>IN the two foregoing books are contained many in&s;tances of equity remedying imperfections in common law as to payment of debt. But that &s;ubject is not exhau&s;ted: on the contrary, it enlarges upon us, when we take under con&s;ideration the law concerning bank|ruptcy. And this branch was purpo&s;ely re&s;erved, to be pre&s;ented to the reader in one view; for the parts are too intimately connected to bear a &s;eparation without &s;uffering by it.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="308">
This branch of law is of great importance in every commercial country; and in order to &s;et it in a clear light, I cannot think of a better arrangement than what follows. Fir&s;t, To &s;tate the rules of common law. Secondly, To examine what equity dictates. Third|ly, To &s;tate the regulations of different countries. And to conclude with the proceedings of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The rules of common law are very &s;hort, and indeed extremely imperfect. Any deed done by a bankrupt is effectual at common law, not le&s;s than if he were &s;olvent. Nor is legal execution ob|&s;tructed by bankruptcy; a creditor, after his debtor's bankruptcy, having the &s;ame remedy for recovering payment, that he had while his debtor was in entire credit. The rea&s;on is, that with re&s;pect to deed done by a bankrupt, and execution by his creditors, the com|mon law regards one circum&s;tance only, <HI>viz.</HI> whether the &s;ubject convey'd by the bankrupt, or attached by his creditors, was the bankrupt's property: if it was, a court of common law &s;upports both. Hence it follows, that no fraud committed by a bankrupt again&s;t his creditors, can be regarded at common law. Let us &s;up|po&s;e the gro&s;&s;e&s;t of all, that he &s;ecretes his moveables, and makes feigned alienations of his lands, in order to di&s;appoint his credi|tors: yet &s;uch acts are con&s;idered as &s;o many exertions of property, and con&s;equently legal.</P>
<P>In order to determine with per&s;picuity what ju&s;tice or equity dic|tates in this ca&s;e, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t place to a&s;cer|tain what circum&s;tances make bankruptcy in the common &s;en&s;e of mankind. A man while he carries on trade, or hath any bu&s;ine&s;s that affords him a pro&s;pect of gain, is not bankrupt though his ef|fects may not be &s;ufficient to pay his debts: it is not unju&s;t to pay one creditor before another, while there is a pro&s;pect of making mo|ney to &s;atisfy all of them. But a man who&s;e effects are not &s;uffi|cient for his debts, and who hath no pro&s;pect of bettering his cir|cum&s;tances, is in the common &s;en&s;e of mankind in&s;olvent or bank|rupt: his creditors mu&s;t lo&s;e by him.</P>
<P>This &s;ituation, though not uncommon, is yet &s;ingular in the eye of ju&s;tice. <HI>Property</HI> and <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> for the mo&s;t part &s;trictly united, are here disjoined: the bankrupt continues proprietor of his e&s;tate, but his creditors are the only per&s;ons intere&s;ted in it: they have the equitable right, and nothing remains with him but the legal right. Con&s;idering the matter in this light, a bankrupt may not improperly be held as a tru&s;tee, bound to manage his effects for be|hoof of his creditors: the duty of a bankrupt is in effect the &s;ame
<PB N="300" REF="309">
with that of a tru&s;tee, as both of them ought to make a faithful account of the &s;ubjects under their management. While a debtor continues &s;olvent, he may pay his creditors in what order he plea|&s;es, becau&s;e no creditor &s;uffers by the preference given to another; but upon his bankruptcy or in&s;olvency, that privilege vani&s;hes; he is bound to all his creditors equally, and ju&s;tice dictates that he ought to di&s;tribute his effects among them equally. If a creditor in demanding payment from his debtors, or their cautioners bound conjunctly and &s;everally, ought to behave with impartiality <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, p. 110. 111.</NOTE>, much more is this incumbent upon a bankrupt in making payment to his creditors. No di&s;tinction ought to be made but between real and per&s;onal creditors: a real &s;ecurity fairly obtained from a debtor in good circum&s;tances, is not prejudicial to the other creditors: &s;uch a right, unexceptionable originally, cannot be voided by any accident that may afterward happen to the debtor; and therefore it is not tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the rule of impartiality for a bankrupt, in di&s;tributing his effects among his creditors, to prefer creditors of this &s;ort before others.</P>
<P>If any he&s;itation remain about this doctrine after what has been &s;aid, I appeal, for removing it, to the general &s;en&s;e of this nation, vouched by act 5. parl. 1696, which, taking for granted that a bank|rupt ought to behave with impartiality to his creditors, prohibits him to prefer any of his creditors before the re&s;t, and annulls every one of his deeds giving &s;uch undue preference. And I may al&s;o ap|peal to the Engli&s;h bankrupt-&s;tatutes, which evidently re&s;t upon the &s;ame foundation.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tands the duty of a bankrupt with re&s;pect to his creditors, founded on the rules of common ju&s;tice. The duty of the creditors with re&s;pect to each other may &s;eem not &s;o evident. It is the privi|lege of a creditor who obtains not &s;atisfaction, to draw his pay|ment out of the debtor's effects; and it will not readily occur, that the debtor's in&s;olvency, the very circum&s;tance which enhances the value of the privilege, &s;hould be a bar to it. This way of think|ing is extremely natural, and hence the following maxims that have obtained an univer&s;al currency: <HI>Prior tempore potior jure: Vigilantibus non dormientibus jura &s;ubveniunt.</HI> In rude times, before the connections produced by &s;ociety have taken deep root, &s;elfi&s;h principles prevail over tho&s;e that are &s;ocial. Thus in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, a creditor, par|tial to his own intere&s;t, is apt to confine his thoughts to the power he hath over his debtor; overlooking, or &s;eeing but ob&s;curely, that
<PB N="301" REF="310">
where the debtor is bankrupt, all the creditors are connected with each other by a common fund, the only &s;ubject of their payment. But by refinement of manners, the &s;ocial connections gain the a|&s;cendant: man becomes more a &s;ocial than a &s;elfi&s;h being; and by the improvement of his rational as well as &s;en&s;itive faculties, he di&s;|covers the lawful authority of &s;ocial duties, as what he is bound to fulfil even in oppo&s;ition to his own intere&s;t. By &s;uch refinement it is at la&s;t perceived, that upon the debtor's in&s;olvency his per&s;onal creditors have all of them an equal claim upon his effects: that a creditor taking mea&s;ures to operate his payment, ought to con&s;ider the connection he has with his fellow-creditors engaged equally with him upon the &s;ame fund; and therefore that ju&s;tice requires an e|qual di&s;tribution. In every view we take of the &s;ubject, we become more and more &s;atisfied that this rule is agreeable to ju&s;tice. To make the di&s;tribution of the common fund depend on priority of exe|cution, exhibits the appearance of a race, where the &s;wifte&s;t obtains the prize: a race is a more manly competition, becau&s;e there is me|rit in &s;wiftne&s;s; whereas priority in execution depends upon acci|dent more frequently than upon expedition. It is natural for &s;avage animals to fall out about their prey, and to rob each other; but &s;o|cial beings ought to be governed by the principle of benevolence: creditors in particular, being connected by a common fund, and equally intere&s;ted, &s;hould not like enemies &s;trive to prevent each o|ther; but like near relations &s;hould join in common mea&s;ures for the common benefit.</P>
<P>But to put this matter pa&s;t doubt, I urge the following argument. A debtor, after his in&s;olvency, is bound to di&s;tribute his effects equally among his creditors; and it would be an act of inju&s;tice in him to prefer any of them before the re&s;t. It nece&s;&s;arily follows, that a creditor cannot be innocent, who, knowing the bankruptcy, takes more than his proportion of the effects: if he take more by vo|luntary payment, he is acce&s;&s;ory to an unju&s;t act done by the bank|rupt; and it will not be thought that he can ju&s;tly take more by ex|ecution than by voluntary payment. If he &s;hould attempt &s;uch wrong, it is the duty of the judge to refu&s;e execution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See book 1. part 1. chap. 7. &s;ect. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>That creditors having notice of their debtor's bankruptcy are barred from taking advantage of each other, &s;eems now &s;ufficiently evident. It is a matter of greater intricacy, what effect bankrupt|cy ought to have again&s;t creditors who are ignorant of it. I begin with the ca&s;e of payment made by a bankrupt in money or effects,
<PB N="302" REF="311">
which transfers the property to his creditor. It is demon&s;trated a|bove <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 232.</NOTE>, that even in the ca&s;e of &s;tellionate, the &s;econd purcha&s;er, &s;uppo&s;ing him <HI>in bona fide,</HI> and not partaker of his author's fraud, is &s;ecure by getting the fir&s;t infeftment, and that his purcha&s;e can|not be cut down in equity more than at common law. The rea&s;oning there concludes with equal if not &s;uperior force in the ca&s;e of bankruptcy: it is unju&s;t in a bankrupt to prefer one creditor before another; but if he offer payment, the creditor who accepts, &s;uppo&s;ing him ignorant of the bankruptcy, is innocent, and therefore &s;ecure: the property of the money or effects being transferred to him in lieu of his debt, there is no rule in equity more than at common law to forfeit him of his property. The &s;ame rea&s;oning concludes in favour of a creditor, who, ignorant of the bankruptcy, recovers payment by a poinding, or by a forthcoming upon an arre&s;tment.</P>
<P>Next comes the ca&s;e of a real &s;ecurity, the nature of which is, that it transfers not the property of the &s;ubject. It is ob&s;erved above, that a real &s;ecurity obtained before bankruptcy is in all events a preferable debt. But what if it be obtained after bankruptcy? The creditor, who, ignorant of his debtor's bankruptcy, obtains from him &s;uch &s;ecurity, whether by legal execution or by volun|tary deed, is not culpable in any degree: at the &s;ame time, before this &s;ecurity exi&s;ted, the equitable right to the bankrupt's effects was transferred to his creditors, who were intitled each of them to draw a &s;hare in proportion to his ju&s;t claim, &s;uppo&s;ing all of them at that period to have been per&s;onal creditors. This right e&s;tabli&s;hed in e|quity, cannot in equity be voided by legal execution; which is cal|culated to force payment of what is ju&s;tly due, and not to create a debt nor to enlarge it: far le&s;s can it be voided by the voluntary deed of the bankrupt, which as to him is an unju&s;t act. Where a debt is actually extingui&s;hed by payment, and the property of the money transferred, the court cannot interpo&s;e; for equity never de|prives an innocent man of his property. But where the creditor is &s;till <HI>in petitorio,</HI> the court ju&s;tly refu&s;es to interpo&s;e in his behalf, be|cau&s;e his real &s;ecurity cannot be &s;upported without forfeiting the o|ther creditors of their equitable rights.</P>
<P>If in a bankrupt it be unju&s;t to divide his effects unequally among his creditors, it is &s;till more unju&s;t to hurt his whole creditors by gratuitous alienations or gratuitous bonds. A gratuitous alienation transferring the property, cannot, it is true, be voided, if the donee
<PB N="303" REF="312">
be not in the knowledge of the bankruptcy: but he is liable to make good the value to the bankrupt's creditors, upon the rule of e|quity <HI>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura;</HI> which is not appli|cable to an alienation before bankruptcy, becau&s;e by &s;uch an aliena|tion the creditors are not hurt. But again&s;t a gratuitous bond claimed after bankruptcy, though executed and delivered while the granter was in good circum&s;tances, the rule <HI>Quod nemo debet locupleta|ri aliena jactura</HI> is applicable; becau&s;e the taking payment is a direct prejudice to the creditors, who have given a valuable con&s;ideration, by le&s;&s;ening their fund; and for that rea&s;on a court of equity will not interpo&s;e to make &s;uch a bond effectual. It de&s;erves attention, that this principle operates in favour of a creditor who lent his money even after the date of the gratuitous bond <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dirleton, January 21. 1677, Ardblair contra Wil&s;on.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The equitable right to the debtor's effects, which, upon his in&s;ol|vency, accrues to his creditors, makes it wrong in him to &s;ell any of his effects privately without their con&s;ent. The &s;ale indeed is effec|tual at common law; but the purcha&s;er, &s;uppo&s;ing his knowledge of the bankruptcy, is acce&s;&s;ory to the wrong, and the &s;ale is void|able upon that ground. The principle of utility al&s;o declares again&s;t a &s;ale of that nature: for to permit a bankrupt to alien his effects privately, even for a ju&s;t price, is throwing a temptation in his way to defraud his creditors, by the opportunity he has to walk off with the money.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee that in applying the rules of equity to the ca&s;e of bankruptcy, two preliminary facts are of importance; fir&s;t, the com|mencement of the bankruptcy; and, next, what knowledge creditors or others have of it: the former is nece&s;&s;ary to be a&s;certained in e|very ca&s;e; the latter frequently. The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch proof tends to darken and perplex law-&s;uits concerning bankruptcy. To expi&s;cate even the commencement of bankruptcy, mu&s;t always be difficult, con&s;idering that it depends on an internal act of the debtor's mind deeming his affairs irretrievable: and the difficulty is greatly increa|&s;ed, when the knowledge of the bankruptcy comes al&s;o to be a point at i&s;&s;ue; for &s;uch knowledge mu&s;t be gathered commonly from a va|riety of circum&s;tances, that are &s;carce ever the &s;ame in any two ca&s;es. To avoid &s;uch intricate expi&s;cation, which tends to make law-&s;uits endle&s;s and judges arbitrary, it has been a great aim of the legi&s;lature in every commercial country, to &s;pecify &s;ome ouvert act that &s;hall be held not only the commencement of bankruptcy, but al&s;o a public notification of it.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="313">
But if the &s;pecifying a legal mark of bankruptcy be of great im|portance, the choice of a proper act for &s;uch a mark is not le&s;s nice than important. Whether in any country a choice altogether unex|ceptionable has been made, &s;eems doubtful. It ought, in the fir&s;t place, to be &s;ome act that cannot readily happen except in bankrupt|cy: for to e&s;tabli&s;h as a mark of bankruptcy any act that may happen where there is no bankruptcy, may have pernicious con&s;equences, and be upon occa&s;ion a heavy puni&s;hment without any guilt. Secondly, It mu&s;t be &s;uch an act as will readily happen in bankruptcy, and which a bankrupt cannot prevent: for if it be in his power to &s;uppre&s;s it altogether, or for any time, he may in the interim do much wrong for which there can be no remedy.</P>
<P>Having thus gone through the rules of the common law and the rules of equity concerning bankruptcy, we are, I pre&s;ume, &s;ufficiently prepared for the third article propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> to &s;tate the regulations of different countries upon that &s;ubject. And to bring the pre&s;ent article within rea&s;onable compa&s;s, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the Roman law, the Engli&s;h law, and that of Scotland, which may be thought &s;uffi|cient for a &s;pecimen. I begin with the Roman law. A debtor's ab|&s;conding intitled his creditors to apply to the court for a <HI>curator bonis;</HI> and after the creditors were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by their <HI>curator,</HI> no cre|ditor could take payment from the bankrupt <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 6. &sect; 7. Quae in fraud. cred. l. 10. &sect; 16. eod.</NOTE>. This <HI>mi&s;&s;io in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;io|nem,</HI> however, &s;eems not to have been deemed a public notification of bankruptcy; for even after that period, a purcha&s;er from the bank|rupt was &s;ecure, if it could not be proved that he was <HI>particeps fraudis</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 9. Quae in fraud. cred.</NOTE>. But every gratuitous deed was re&s;cinded, whether the acquirer was ac|ce&s;&s;ory to the wrong or not <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 6. &sect; 11. eod.</NOTE>; and in particular a gratuitous di&s;charge of a debt <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">l. 1. &sect; 2. eod.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>mi&s;&s;io in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ionem</HI> the debtor continued to have the ma|nagement as while he was &s;olvent, and particularly was intitled to pay his creditors in what order he thought proper. It is accordingly laid down, That a creditor, who before the <HI>mi&s;&s;io in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ionem</HI> receives pay|ment, is &s;ecure, though he be in the knowledge of his debtor's in&s;ol|vency. <HI>Sibi enim vigilavit,</HI> &s;ays the author <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">l. 6. &sect; 7. eod.</NOTE>: a doctrine very ju&s;t with re&s;pect to a court of common law, but very aver&s;e to Praetorian law or principles of equity.</P>
<P>The defects of the foregoing &s;y&s;tem are many, but &s;o obvious as to make a li&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary. I &s;hall mention two particulars only, being
<PB N="305" REF="314">
of great importance. The fir&s;t is, that the nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;tabli&s;hing a public mark of bankruptcy which every one is pre&s;umed to know, &s;eems to have been altogether overlooked by the Romans. Even the <HI>mi&s;&s;io in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ionem,</HI> as mentioned above, was not held &s;uch a mark. It is true, that after &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion no creditor could take payment from the bankrupt. But why? Not becau&s;e of the creditor's <HI>mala fides,</HI> but becau&s;e the creditors in general, being put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bankrupt's funds, acquired thereby a <HI>jus pignoris,</HI> and in the divi&s;ion of the price were accordingly intitled each of them to a rateable pro|portion. I ob&s;erve next, that it is a great over&s;ight in the Roman law, to neglect that remarkable period which runs between the fir&s;t act of bankruptcy and the <HI>mi&s;&s;io in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ionem.</HI> In that period generally all contrivances are &s;et on foot to cover the effects of the bankrupt, or to prefer the favourite creditors.</P>
<P>In England, the regulations concerning bankrupts are extended farther than in the Roman law, and are brought much nearer the rules of equity above laid down. The nomination of commi&s;&s;ioners by the chancellor upon application of the creditors, is, in effect, the &s;ame with the nomination of a <HI>curator bonis</HI> in the Roman law. The foregoing defects of the Roman law are at the &s;ame time &s;upplied, by declaring a debtor's ab&s;conding or keeping out of the way, termed <HI>the fir&s;t act of bankruptcy,</HI> to be a public mark or notification of bank|ruptcy, of which no per&s;on is &s;uffered to plead ignorance. From that moment the hands both of the bankrupt and of his creditors are tied up: he can do no deed that is prejudicial to his creditors in general, or to any one in particular: they, on the other hand, are not permit|ted to receive a voluntary payment, nor to operate their payment by legal execution.</P>
<P>It is perhaps not ea&s;y to invent a regulation better calculated for fulfilling the rules of equity, than that now mentioned. It may be thought indeed, that the ab&s;conding or keeping out of the way, &s;up|po&s;ing it momentary only, is a circum&s;tance too &s;light and too private to be impo&s;ed upon all the world as notorious. But it ought to be con&s;idered, that the Engli&s;h bankrupt-&s;tatutes are confined to mercan|tile people, who live by buying and &s;elling: and with re&s;pect to a merchant, his ab&s;conding or keeping out of the way is a mark of bankruptcy neither &s;light nor ob&s;cure. Merchants convene regularly in the exchange; a retailer ought to be found in his &s;hop or ware|hou&s;e; and their ab&s;conding or ab&s;ence without a ju&s;t cau&s;e is con|&s;picuous. A per&s;on may happen, for &s;ome time, to be ignorant of the fir&s;t act of bankruptcy; but a &s;ingular ca&s;e mu&s;t not be made an
<PB N="306" REF="315">
exception to a general rule: ju&s;tice mu&s;t be di&s;tributed by general rules; and it is better for &s;ociety that &s;ome individuals &s;uffer than that judges become arbitrary and law-&s;uits endle&s;s. There is indeed a hard&s;hip in this regulation with re&s;pect to commerce, which is &s;often|ed by a late &s;tatute <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">19. Geo. II. cap. 32.</NOTE>, enacting, That money received from a bank|rupt in the cour&s;e of trade and dealing before the commi&s;&s;ion of bank|ruptcy &s;ued forth, whether in payment of goods &s;old to the bankrupt, or of a bill of exchange accepted by him, &s;hall not be claimed by the a&s;&s;ignees to the bankruptcy, unle&s;s it be made appear, that the per|&s;on &s;o receiving payment was in the knowledge of the debtor's bank|ruptcy. This is in effect declaring with re&s;pect to payment received in the cour&s;e of trade, that the i&s;&s;uing the commi&s;&s;ion of bankruptcy is to be deemed the fir&s;t public mark or notification of bankruptcy, and not what is called the fir&s;t act of bankruptcy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t bankrupt-act we have in Scotland is an act of &s;ederunt ra|tified by &s;tatute 1621, cap. 18. intitled, <Q REND="inline">"A ratification of the act of the Lords of Council and Se&s;&s;ion again&s;t unlawful di&s;po&s;itions and alienations made by dyvours and bankrupts."</Q> In this act of &s;ede|runt two articles only are brought under con&s;ideration. Fir&s;t, Frau|dulent contrivances to withdraw a bankrupt's effects from his credi|tors by making &s;imulate and feigned conveyances. Second, The par|tiality of bankrupts, by making payment to favourite creditors, neg|lecting others. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, it is &s;et forth in the pream|ble, <Q REND="inline">"That the fraud, malice, and fal&s;ehood of dyvours and bank|rupts was become &s;o frequent as to be in hazard of di&s;&s;olving all tru&s;t and commerce among the &s;ubjects of this kingdom; that ma|ny, by their apparent wealth in land and goods, and by their &s;how of con&s;cience and hone&s;ty, having obtained credit, intend not to pay their debts, but either live riotou&s;ly, or withdraw them&s;elves or their goods forth of this realm to elude all execution of ju&s;tice: and to that effect, and in manife&s;t defraud of their creditors, make &s;i|mulate and fraudful alienations, di&s;po&s;itions, and other &s;ecurities of their lands, rever&s;ions, teinds, goods, actions, debts, and other &s;ubjects belonging to them, to their wives, children, kin&s;men, al|lies, and other confident and interpo&s;ed per&s;ons, without any true, lawful, or nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e, and without any ju&s;t or true price; whereby the creditors and cautioners are fal&s;ely and godle&s;sly de|frauded of their ju&s;t debts, and many hone&s;t families are ruined."</Q> For remedying this evil,&punc; it is ordained and declared, <Q REND="inline">"Fir&s;t, That all alienations, di&s;po&s;itions, a&s;&s;ignations, made by the debtor, of any
<PB N="307" REF="316">
of his lands, teinds, rever&s;ions, actions, debts, or goods, to any conjunct or confident per&s;on, without true, ju&s;t, and nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;es, and without a ju&s;t price really paid, &s;hall be of no force or effect again&s;t prior creditors. Second, Whoever purcha&s;es from the &s;aid interpo&s;ed per&s;ons any of the bankrupt's lands or goods, at a ju&s;t price, or in &s;atisfaction of debt, <HI>bona fide,</HI> without being par|taker of the fraud, &s;hall be &s;ecure. Third, The receiver of the price &s;hall make the &s;ame forthcoming to the bankrupt's creditors. Fourth, It &s;hall be &s;ufficient evidence of the fraud intended again&s;t the creditors, if they verify by writ, or by oath of the party-receiver of any right from the dyvour or bankrupt, that the &s;ame was made without any true, ju&s;t, and nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e, or without any true price; or that the lands or goods of the bankrupt being &s;old by the interpo&s;ed per&s;on, the price is to be converted to the bankrupt's profit and u&s;e. Fifth, All &s;uch bankrupts, and interpo&s;ed per&s;ons for covering or executing their frauds, and all others who &s;hall give coun&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the &s;aid bankrupts in devi&s;ing and practi&s;ing their frauds and godle&s;s deceits to the prejudice of their true creditors, &s;hall be reputed and holden di&s;hone&s;t, fal&s;e, and in|famous per&s;ons, incapable of all honours, dignities, benefices, and offices, or to pa&s;s upon an inque&s;t or a&s;&s;ize, or to bear witne&s;s in judgment or outwith, in any time coming."</Q></P>
<P>The clau&s;e re&s;training a bankrupt's partiality in making payment to favourite creditors and neglecting others, is expre&s;&s;ed in the following terms: <Q REND="inline">"If any bankrupt, or interpo&s;ed per&s;on partaker of his fraud, &s;hall make any voluntary payment or right to any per&s;on, in de|fraud of the more timely diligence of another creditor, having &s;er|ved inhibition, or u&s;ed horning, arre&s;tment, compri&s;ing, or other lawful mean to affect the bankrupt's lands, goods, or price there|of; in that ca&s;e the bankrupt, or interpo&s;ed per&s;on, &s;hall be bound to make the &s;ame forthcoming to the creditor having u&s;ed the more timely diligence. And this creditor &s;hall likewi&s;e have good action to recover from the co-creditor po&s;terior in diligence what was vo|luntarily paid to him in defraud of the pur&s;uer."</Q></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the article concerning fraud, this act is an addi|tional in&s;tance of what I have had more than one opportunity to ob|&s;erve, that the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, for many years after its in&s;titution, acted as a court of common law only. No wrong calls louder for a remedy than frauds committed by bankrupts in concealing their ef|fects from their creditors; and yet from the preamble of the act it appears, that the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion had not, before that period, a&s;&s;u|med
<PB N="308" REF="317">
the power to redre&s;s any of the&s;e frauds. Nor is it clear that the power was a&s;&s;umed by the &s;e&s;&s;ion as a court of equity: it is more pre&s;umeable that the court con&s;idered it&s;elf as a court of common law acting by legi&s;lative authority; fir&s;t by authority of its own act, and afterward by authority of the act of parliament:&mdash;I &s;ay by authority of its own act; for the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion being impowered by parliament to make regulations for the better admini&s;tration of ju|&s;tice, an act of &s;ederunt originally was held equivalent to an act of parliament.</P>
<P>This act, framed as we ought to &s;uppo&s;e by the wi&s;e&s;t heads in the nation, is however not only &s;hamefully imperfect, but in &s;everal par|ticulars gro&s;sly unju&s;t. No general regulations are e&s;tabli&s;hed con|cerning the conduct of the bankrupt, of his creditors, or of the jud|ges: no ouvert act is fixed as a public notification of bankruptcy: nor is there any regulation barring the creditors from taking advantage of each other by precipitancy of execution. Such blindne&s;s is the le&s;s excu&s;able in judges to whom the Roman law was no &s;tranger; and who, in an Engli&s;h bankrupt-&s;tatute pa&s;&s;ed a few years before, had a good model to copy after, and to improve. But this act, which has occa&s;ioned many irregular and even unju&s;t deci&s;ions, mu&s;t be exami|ned more particularly.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, There cannot be a &s;tronger in&s;tance of un&s;kilful|ne&s;s in making laws, than the clau&s;e in the &s;tatute confining the evi|dence of fraud to the writ or oath of the per&s;on who receives any &s;ub|ject from the bankrupt. A very little in&s;ight into human nature would have taught our judges, that it is in vain to think of detecting fraud by the evidence of tho&s;e who deal in it, whether as principals or acce&s;&s;ories. Covered crimes mu&s;t be detected by circum&s;tances, or not at all; and &s;uch matters, being beyond the reach of a general rule, mu&s;t be left with judges, without any rule other than to deter|mine every ca&s;e according to its peculiar circum&s;tances. And accor|dingly we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;ee afterward, that the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion were forc'd to abandon the evidence e&s;tabli&s;hed by them&s;elves, and in every in&s;tance to indulge &s;uch proof as the nature of the ca&s;e would admit. In the &s;econd place, With re&s;pect to deeds done again&s;t creditors in general, it may at fir&s;t view appear &s;trange, that the act of &s;ederunt &s;hould be confined to actual fraud; a crime that merits puni&s;hment, and to which accordingly a puni&s;hment is annexed in the act it&s;elf. It plainly reacheth not a gratuitous deed in favour of children or others, however prejudicial to creditors; provided it be not granted fraudulently in order to hurt them, but in order to bene|fit
<PB N="309" REF="318">
the donees. This palpable defect in the act will be accounted for by an ob&s;ervation one has occa&s;ion to make daily, that in reforming abu&s;es, there is generally a degree of diffidence which prevents the innovation from being carried its due length. The repre&s;&s;ing actual fraud was a great improvement, which filled the mind, and &s;carce left room for a thought that the improvement could be carried far|ther. And, in all probability, it appeared a bolder &s;tep to &s;upply the defect of common law by voiding frauds committed by bank|rupts, than to &s;upply the defect of the &s;tatute by voiding al&s;o gratui|tous deeds.</P>
<P>So much upon the fir&s;t article; and, with re&s;pect to the &s;econd, which is calculated to re&s;train the bankrupt from acting partially a|mong his creditors, it is not in my power to give it any colour either of ju&s;tice or expediency. I have been much di&s;po&s;ed to think, that an inchoated act of execution was intended by the legi&s;lature to be the public notification of bankruptcy &s;o often mentioned. But I am ob|liged to relinqui&s;h that thought, when I con&s;ider, that our &s;tatute 1621 is not confined to merchants, but comprehends the whole body of the people; and that an inchoated act of horning or arre&s;tment is &s;carce a mark of bankruptcy at pre&s;ent, far le&s;s when the act was made, with re&s;pect e&s;pecially to landed men. And that in fact it was not intended a mark or notification of bankruptcy, is clear from the following con&s;iderations, that creditors are not barred by it from for|cing payment by legal execution, nor even the bankrupt from acting partially among his creditors; for, excepting that creditor only who hath commenced execution, it continues in the bankrupt's power as much as ever to di&s;tribute his effects among his favourite creditors, leaving the re&s;t without a remedy. But it is fruitle&s;s to di&s;gui&s;e a truth which will be di&s;covered by every per&s;on of reflection, that this clau&s;e in the &s;tatute betrays gro&s;s ignorance of ju&s;tice. There ought, no doubt, to be a remedy again&s;t the creditor who obtains payment by the bankrupt's partiality: but to make him &s;urrender the whole to the creditor who has got the &s;tart in execution, is an unju&s;t reme|dy; for ju&s;tice only requires that he &s;hould &s;urrender a part, that both may be upon a level. To make him &s;urrender the whole is indeed an effectual cure to the bankrupt's partiality, but a cure that is wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e; wor&s;e, I &s;ay, becau&s;e the partiality of an individual is a &s;pectacle much le&s;s di&s;gu&s;ting than is the partiality of law. This regulation is unju&s;t, even &s;uppo&s;ing the bankruptcy to be known to the creditor who receives payment. But how much more glaring the inju&s;tice where he happens to be ignorant of that fact? the money he

receives becomes undoubtedly his property, and ju&s;tice forfeits not a man of his property without a fault; and therefore to wre&s;t from a creditor a &s;um he has received <HI>bona fide</HI> in payment of a ju&s;t debt, is in reality to inflict a puni&s;hment without a delinquency. Nor is this all. The regulation in it&s;elf unju&s;t, is not le&s;s &s;o with re|&s;pect to con&s;equences. Voluntary payment effectually binds up the creditor from forcing payment by legal execution: in the mean time the funds of the bankrupt are &s;wept away by other creditors: and if, after all, the creditor be forc'd to &s;urrender the whole &s;um received by him in payment, he is left without a remedy, and is in a much wor&s;e &s;tate than if payment had not been offered him. Viewing a|gain this regulation with re&s;pect to utility, it appears not le&s;s inexpe|dient than unju&s;t: to excite creditors to take the &s;tart in execution, it holds out a premium, to which they are not intitled by the rules of ju&s;tice; a premium therefore that tends to a very unhappy con&s;e|quence, <HI>viz.</HI> to overwhelm with precipitant execution hone&s;t dealers, who, treated with humanity, might have emerged out of their diffi|culties, and have become bold and pro&s;perous traders.</P>
<P>The next bankrupt-&s;tatute in order of time is the act 62. parl. 1661, ranking <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with the fir&s;t effectual appri&s;ing, all appri|&s;ings of a prior date, and all led within year and day of it; for I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;how afterward, that this &s;tatute ought to be cla&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e concerning bankruptcy, though not commonly con&s;idered in that light. But the connection of matter, more in|timate than that of time, leads me fir&s;t to the act 5. parl. 1696, in|tended evidently to &s;upply the defects of the act 1621. Experience di&s;covered in the act 1621 one defect mentioned above, that no ouvert act is a&s;certained, to be held the fir&s;t act of bankruptcy as well as a public notification of it. This defect is &s;upplied by the act 1696, in the following manner. An in&s;olvent debtor under execu|tion by horning and caption, is declared a notour bankrupt, provi|ded he be impri&s;oned, or retire to a &s;anctuary, or fly, or ab&s;cond, or defend his per&s;on by force. This is one term, and counting &s;ixty days backward, another term is fixed; after which all partial deeds by a bankrupt among his creditors are prohibited. The words are, <Q REND="inline">"All di&s;po&s;itions, a&s;&s;ignations, or other deeds, granted by the bankrupt at any time within &s;ixty days before his notour bankruptcy, in fa|vour of a creditor, directly or indirectly, for his &s;atisfaction or fur|ther &s;ecurity, preferring him to other creditors, &s;hall be null and void."</Q></P>
<P>It will be ob&s;erved, that this &s;tatute, with re&s;pect to the legal com|mencement
<PB N="311" REF="320">
of bankruptcy, differs widely from tho&s;e made in Eng|land. And indeed, to have copied the&s;e &s;tatutes, by making ab&s;cond|ing, or keeping out of the way, the fir&s;t act of bankruptcy, would in this country have been improper. In England, arre&s;tment of the debtor's per&s;on till he find bail being generally the fir&s;t act of exe|cution, a debtor, to avoid impri&s;onment, mu&s;t ab&s;cond or keep out of the way the moment his credit is &s;u&s;pected; and therefore in Eng|land, ab&s;conding or keeping out of the way is a mark of bankrupt|cy not at all ambiguous. But in Scotland, this mark of bankruptcy would always be too late; for with us there mu&s;t be &s;everal &s;teps of execution before a bankrupt be forc'd to ab&s;cond, letters of horn|ing, a charge, a denunciation, a caption. In this country therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pecify &s;ome mark of bankruptcy antecedent to ab&s;conding. The mark that would corre&s;pond the neare&s;t to ab|&s;conding in England, is denunciation upon a horning; for after re|ceiving a charge, the debtor, if he have any credit, will be upon his guard again&s;t denunciation, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be e&s;tabli&s;hed as a public notification of bankruptcy. But our legi&s;lature perhaps &s;howed greater penetration, in commencing bankruptcy from a term of which even the bankrupt mu&s;t be ignorant. Sudden bankruptcy is &s;o rare as &s;carce to de&s;erve the attention of the legi&s;lature. A man com|monly becomes bankrupt long before he is publicly known to be &s;o by ultimate execution; and con&s;idering that the &s;u&s;picious period, during which a debtor is tempted to act fraudulently, commences the moment he fore&s;ees the ruin of his credit, which is generally more than two months before his notour bankruptcy, it appears the &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e to tie up a bankrupt's hands during that period. Such retro&s;pect from notour bankruptcy cannot be productive of any wrong, if it have no other effect but to void &s;ecurities, which creditors obtain by force of execution, or by the voluntary deed of their debtor. And therefore the &s;tatute 1696, &s;o far as concerns the commencement of bankruptcy, &s;eems wi&s;e and political, and perhaps the be&s;t that is to be found in any country.</P>
<P>The &s;tatute adheres &s;trictly to the principles of equity above laid down, &s;o far as it voids every &s;ecurity granted to one creditor in pre|judice of the re&s;t, by their debtor, within &s;ixty days of his notour bankruptcy, or, in other words, after the commencement of his bank|ruptcy a&s;certained as above. But I mu&s;t add, with regret, that it goes unwarily too far, when it voids al&s;o without di&s;tinction con|veyances made in &s;atisfaction or payment of debt. To deprive a man of a &s;ubject, the property of which he has obtained <HI>bona &s;ide</HI> in
<PB N="312" REF="321">
lieu of a debt, is, as ob&s;erved above, incon&s;i&s;tent with an inviolable rule of ju&s;tice, That an innocent man ought never to be forfeited of his property: and therefore a conveyance of this nature ought not to be voided, unle&s;s the creditor receiving &s;atisfaction be in the know|ledge of his debtor's bankruptcy.</P>
<P>But this is an error of &s;mall importance compared with what fol|lows. After the commencement of bankruptcy, a&s;certained as above, a bankrupt is prohibited to act partially among his creditors; and yet creditors are permitted, as in the act 1621, to act partially among them&s;elves, and to prevent each other by legal execution. To per|mit a creditor to take by legal execution what he is prohibited to re|ceive voluntarily, is a glaring ab&s;urdity. Payment or &s;atisfaction obtained <HI>bona fide,</HI> whether from the bankrupt him&s;elf, or by force of execution, ought to be &s;u&s;tained: but after the commencement of bankruptcy, there is the &s;ame ju&s;tice for voiding a &s;ecurity ob|tained by execution, that there is for voiding a &s;ecurity obtained voluntarily from the bankrupt. And yet our legi&s;lature has de|viated &s;o widely from ju&s;tice, as to give full &s;cope to execution even after notour bankruptcy. Nothing can be conceived more gro&s;s. It had been a wi&s;e regulation, that upon notour bankruptcy a factor &s;hould be appointed, to convert the bankrupt's effects into money, and to di&s;tribute the &s;ame among the creditors at the &s;ight of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. This regulation, e&s;tabli&s;hed in Rome and in Eng|land, ought not to have been overlooked. But if it was not pala|table, our legi&s;lature ought at lea&s;t to have prohibited more to be ta|ken by any execution, than a rateable proportion; for after notour bankruptcy no creditor can be <HI>in bona fide</HI> to take payment of his whole debt.</P>
<P>The inju&s;tice and ab&s;urdity of permitting a creditor to take by ex|ecution what he is di&s;charged to receive from his debtor voluntarily, though left without remedy by our two capital bankrupt-&s;tatutes, have not however been altogether overlooked. And I now proceed to the regulations made to correct that evil, which, for the &s;ake of connection, I have re&s;erved to the la&s;t place, though one of the&s;e re|gulations comes in point of time before the act 1696. The great load of debt contracted during our civil wars in the reign of Charles I. and the decay of credit occa&s;ioned thereby, produced the act 62. parl. 1661, laying down regulations &s;uited to the times, for ea&s;ing debtors and re&s;toring credit. Among other articles, <Q REND="inline">"All appri&s;ings deduced &s;ince the 1&s;t of January 1652, before the fir&s;t effectual appri&s;ing, or after, but within year and day of the &s;ame, are ap|pointed
<PB N="313" REF="322">
to come in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u,</HI> as if one appri&s;ing had been deduced for the whole."</Q> This regulation is general without re&s;pect to bank|ruptcy. But whatever &s;tretches may be nece&s;&s;ary for a particular exigency, it is evident, that the regulation cannot be ju&s;tified as a perpetual law, except upon &s;uppo&s;ition that all the appri&s;ings are de|duced after the debtor is in&s;olvent. A debtor while he is in good circum&s;tances, may pay his debts or grant real &s;ecurities in what or|der he plea&s;es. By u&s;ing this privilege he harms none of his credi|tors: they have no ground for challenging &s;uch a deed at the time when it is granted; and his &s;upervening bankruptcy cannot afford them a ground of challenge which they had not at fir&s;t. A &s;ecurity obtained by an appri&s;ing or adjudication is preci&s;ely &s;imilar. If the debtor be &s;olvent when &s;uch judicial &s;ecurity is obtained by his cre|ditor, the other creditors &s;uffer not by it; and the adjudger who has thus fairly obtained a &s;ecurity, mu&s;t be intitled to make the be&s;t of his right, whether the debtor afterward become in&s;olvent or not. I have rea&s;on therefore to place the foregoing &s;tatute, con&s;idered as perpetual, among tho&s;e which have been enacted in the ca&s;e of bank|ruptcy: and in order to fulfil the rules of ju&s;tice, it is the duty of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, as a court of equity, to con&s;ider it in that light. The involved circum&s;tances of debtors and creditors at the time of the &s;tatute, made it a &s;alutary regulation to bring in appri&s;ers <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u,</HI> even where the debtor was &s;olvent, though evidently a &s;tretch again&s;t ju&s;tice: but to adhere &s;trictly to the regulation at pre&s;ent, when there is not the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity, is to adhere rigidly to the words again&s;t the mind and intendment of the legi&s;lature; for &s;urely it could not be intended, that a creditor &s;hould for ever be deprived of the preference he obtains by being the fir&s;t adjudger, even though the other creditors are not hurt by that preference. That after the debtor's bankruptcy a creditor &s;hould not be permitted to take more than his proportion of the common fund, is extremely ju&s;t; and &s;o far the &s;tatute ought to be held perpetual. What farther is enacted to an&s;wer a particular purpo&s;e, ought to be con&s;idered as temporary; becau&s;e the legi&s;lature could not mean it to be perpetual.</P>
<P>If then the foregoing &s;tatute be held to be perpetual, it mu&s;t be confined to the ca&s;e of bankruptcy; and in that view it de&s;erves to be immortal. The fir&s;t adjudication may be ju&s;tly held a public mark or notification of the debtor's bankruptcy, warning the other creditors to be&s;tir them&s;elves; and a year commonly is &s;ufficient for them to lead adjudications, which, by authority of the &s;tatute, will intitle each creditor to a proportion of the debtor's real e&s;tate. This
<PB N="314" REF="323">
was a happy commencement of a much wanted reformation. The court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, taking example, ventured to declare by an act of &s;ederunt <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Feb. 28. 1662.</NOTE>, That the priority of a creditor's confirmation &s;hall afford no preference in competition with other creditors confirming within &s;ix months of the death of their debtor. By another act of &s;ede|runt <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Augu&s;t 9. 1754.</NOTE>, All arre&s;tments within &s;ixty days preceding the notour bank|ruptcy, or within four months thereafter, are ranked <HI>par i pa&s;&s;u;</HI> and every creditor who poinds within &s;ixty days preceding the notour bankruptcy, or within four months thereafter, is obliged to commu|nicate a proportion to the other creditors &s;uing him within a limited time <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act of &s;ederunt, ibid.</NOTE>. In the heat of reformation, the la&s;t mentioned regulation is carried too far. Poinding operates at once a transference of the property and a di&s;charge of the debt; and &s;uppo&s;ing a poinder to be ignorant of his debtor's in&s;olvency, which is frequently the ca&s;e where the execution precedes the notour bankruptcy, there is no rule in equity more than at common law to oblige the poinder to com|municate any proportion to the other creditors. Nay, it is po&s;&s;ible that a debtor may be &s;olvent within &s;ixty days of his notour bank|ruptcy: a poinding again&s;t him in that ca&s;e, which wounds not the other creditors, ought not to afford them the &s;hadow of a claim.</P>
<P>The principles of equity ripening gradually, our zeal for the act 1661 has increa&s;ed; and there is a vi&s;ible tendency in our judges to make the remedy &s;till more complete. In order to that end, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, as a court of equity, might have enlarged the time given by the &s;tatute for leading adjudications. The principles of ju|&s;tice authori&s;e a &s;till bolder &s;tep, which is to put upon an equal foot|ing all adjudications that are led upon debts exi&s;ting before the fir&s;t adjudication. But the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, wavering always as to their equitable powers, have not hitherto ventured &s;o far. Not adverting to an obvious doctrine, That in order to fulfil ju&s;tice it is lawful to enlarge or improve means laid down in a &s;tatute, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion hath not attempted directly to enlarge the time for bringing in ad|judgers <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u:</HI> but they do the &s;ame thing every day indirectly; for upon the application of any creditor, &s;etting forth, <Q REND="inline">"That if the common <HI>induciae</HI> required in the proce&s;&s;es of con&s;titution and adju|dication be not abridged in his favour, he cannot hope to com|plete his adjudication within year and day of the adjudication fir&s;t effectual,"</Q> the court, without requiring any cau&s;e to be a&s;&s;igned for the delay, give authority for adjudging &s;ummarily; which in ef|fect is declaring, that all adjudgers &s;hall have the benefit of the &s;ta|tute,
<PB N="315" REF="324">
provided the &s;ummons of adjudication be within year and day of the fir&s;t effectual adjudication. It may be que&s;tioned whe|ther this is not too indulgent; for, as it appears to me, the extraor|dinary privilege of &s;hortening the forms ought not to be indulged, unle&s;s the creditor can a&s;&s;ign &s;ome good cau&s;e for his delay; be|cau&s;e the law ought not to be extended in favour of any man who &s;uffers by his own fault or neglect. It is curious at the &s;ame time to ob&s;erve, in what manner a court, like an individual, afraid of a bold &s;tep, will, to &s;hun it, venture upon one not le&s;s bold in reality, though perhaps le&s;s in appearance: for to abridge or di&s;pen&s;e with forms, &s;alutary in them&s;elves, and &s;anctified by inveterate prac|tice, is an act of authority not le&s;s extraordinary, than to enlarge the time afforded in a &s;tatute for ranking adjudgers <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u.</HI></P>
<P>But after all, the foregoing regulations, calculated to put credi|tors upon a level in the ca&s;e of bankruptcy, are mere palliatives: they &s;often the di&s;ea&s;e, but &s;trike not at the root. The court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion tried once a bolder and more effectual remedy, borrowed from the law of Rome and of England, <HI>viz.</HI> to name a factor for mana|ging and di&s;po&s;ing of the bankrupt's moveable funds, in order that the price may be equally di&s;tributed among the creditors: and why that regulation was not made perpetual I cannot explain.</P>
<P>According to the method propo&s;ed in the beginning, nothing now remains but the operations of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, to which I pro|ceed, beginning with deci&s;ions relative to the &s;tatutes, and conclu|ding with deci&s;ions founded on equity independent of the &s;tatutes. And fir&s;t, the &s;tatute 1621 has been extended to a lea&s;e of land &s;et to a tru&s;tee at an undervalue, in order that the bankrupt him&s;elf might enjoy the profits. A lea&s;e of this nature, though not comprehended under the words of the act, comes plainly under its &s;pirit and inten|tion; and therefore it is the duty of a court of equity to extend the act to this ca&s;e. A fraudulent bond granted by a bankrupt in order to withdraw from the true creditors a part of the fund for the bank|rupt's own behoof, is another example of the &s;ame kind. For, as Sir George Mackenzie ob&s;erves in his explication of this act, <Q REND="inline">"Though neither tacks nor bonds be comprehended under the let|ter of the law, yet the rea&s;on of the law extends to them; and in laws founded on the principles of rea&s;on, exten&s;ions from the &s;ame principles are natural. And in laws introduced for obviating of cheats, exten&s;ions are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the &s;ame &s;ubtile and fraudulent inclination that tempted the debtor to cheat his credi|tors, will tempt him likewi&s;e to cheat the law, if the wi&s;dom and
<PB N="316" REF="325">
prudence of the judge do not interpo&s;e."</Q> A di&s;charge granted by the bankrupt in order to cover a debt from his creditors for his own behoof, will al&s;o come under the act by an equitable interpreta|tion.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the evidence required in the fir&s;t article of the &s;ta|tute 1621, for detecting fraudulent deeds, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion hath a&s;&s;umed a power proper and peculiar to a court of equity. It has been forc'd to abandon the oath or writ of the partaker of the fraud, being a means altogether in&s;ufficient to an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed by the &s;tatute, and in place of it to lay hold of &s;uch evidence as can be had, according to the nature of the ca&s;e. It is accordingly the practice of the court, after weighing circum&s;tances, to pre&s;ume &s;ometimes in favour of the deed till fraud be proved, and &s;ome|times again&s;t the deed till a proof be brought of its being fair and hone&s;t. Thus a bond bearing borrowed money, granted by a bank|rupt to a conjunct and confident per&s;on, was pre&s;umed to be fairly granted for the cau&s;e expre&s;&s;ed; and the burden of proving it to have been granted without any ju&s;t cau&s;e, was, in terms of the act, laid upon the pur&s;uer of the reduction <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, Jan. 22. 1630, Hope-Pringle con|tra Carre.</NOTE>. Again, a di&s;po&s;ition by a bank|rupt of his whole heritage to his &s;on-in-law, upon the narrative of a price paid, was found probative, unle&s;s redargued by the di&s;ponee's oath <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Durie, Jan. 17. 1632.

<P>On the other hand, in a reduction upon the act 1621 of a bond bearing borrowed money granted by a bankrupt to his brother, the judges thought, that though bonds <HI>inter conjunctos</HI> may prove where commercial dealings appear, yet in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e no &s;uch dealings were alledged, and the creditor's circum&s;tances made it improbable that he could have advanced &s;uch a &s;um, and therefore the bond was not &s;u&s;tained as probative of its cau&s;e <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, Forbes, Dec. 5. 1707, Mac|learic contra Glen.</NOTE>.

<P>The &s;econd branch of the act 1621, &s;ecuring a creditor who has commenced execution again&s;t the partiality of his debtor, is &s;o &s;trict|ly interpreted by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, that where a &s;ecurity is void|ed by a creditor prior in execution, the whole benefit is given to him, and the defendant who obtained the &s;ecurity is forfeited of it altoge|ther. And the act 1696 is &s;o &s;trictly interpreted, that moveables be|ing delivered to a creditor in &s;atisfaction of his debt, the tran&s;action was voided becau&s;e delivery was made within &s;ixty days of notour bankruptcy <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple, Jan. 27. 1715, Forbes of Ballogie, July 19. 1728, Smith contra Taylor.</NOTE>; though, ab&s;tracting from the inju&s;tice of depriving an innocent man of his property, the court, in interpreting a rigorous &s;tatute, ought to have limited the words within their narrowe&s;t mean|ing, by finding that moveables, the commerce of which ought to be free, are not comprehended in the &s;tatute.</P>

by a debtor within &s;ixty days before his notour bankruptcy, in favour of a creditor for his &s;atisfaction or &s;ecurity, preferring him before other creditors, are declared null and void."</Q> This clau&s;e admits a double meaning: it may import a total nullity; or it may import a nullity as far only as that creditor is preferred before others. The former meaning would be rational, &s;uppo&s;ing the creditors to be barred from execution as the bankrupt is from alienation: but as they are left free, the latter meaning ought to be adopted, as what an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of the legi&s;lature, and fulfils the rules of ju&s;tice. And yet, I know not by what mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, the former is adopted by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. A di&s;po&s;ition accordingly of this kind was void|ed totally; and other creditors, who had attached the &s;ubject by legal execution, were preferred, without giving the di&s;ponee as much bene|fit by his di&s;po&s;ition as even to bring him in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with the other creditors <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, Dalrymple, Dec. 4. 1704, Man contra Reid. July 19. 1728, Smith contra Taylor.</NOTE>. This is laying hold of the words of a &s;tatute, without regarding its &s;pirit and intendment. It is wor&s;e: it is giving a wrong &s;en&s;e to an ambiguous clau&s;e, in oppo&s;ition to the &s;pirit and intend|ment. The obvious purpo&s;e of the act 1696 is not to deprive a bank|rupt altogether of the management of his affairs, for in that ca&s;e a <HI>curator bonis</HI> mu&s;t have been appointed, but only to bar him from acting partially. It clearly follows, that a court of equity, &s;upporting the &s;pirit of the law, ought not to have carried the reduction farther than to redre&s;s the inequality intended by the di&s;po&s;ition. The court fol|lowed an oppo&s;ite cour&s;e, not le&s;s partial to the pur&s;uers of the reduc|tion, than the di&s;po&s;ition was to the defendant: and their decree ac|cordingly exceeded the bounds of ju&s;tice on the one &s;ide, as much as the bankrupt's di&s;po&s;ition did on the other. The &s;olidity of this rea|&s;oning will be clearly apprehended, in applying it to a &s;ecurity grant|ed by a debtor in good credit, but who, within &s;ixty days thereafter, is a notour bankrupt. The creditor, being <HI>in optima &s;ide</HI> to take a &s;e|curity in the&s;e circum&s;tances, merits no puni&s;hment. Another credi|tor, however, anxious about his debt, attaches the &s;ubject by legal execution; and thus gets the &s;tart of the di&s;ponee, who&s;e hands by the di&s;po&s;ition are tied up from execution. Is it ju&s;t or equitable to void the di&s;po&s;ition altogether, and to prefer the other creditor?</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to particulars that come not under either of the bank|rupt-&s;tatutes, but are left to be regulated by equity, it is &s;urpri&s;ing to ob&s;erve the fluctuation of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion between common law and
<PB N="320" REF="329">
equity. In many in&s;tances, the court hath given way to the inju&s;tice of common law without affording a remedy; for a very odd rea&s;on indeed, That no remedy is provided by &s;tatute. In other in&s;tances, the court, exerting its equitable powers, has boldly applied the reme|dy. I proceed to examples of both.</P>
<P>A &s;ale by a notour bankrupt after the act 1696, was &s;upported for the following rea&s;on, That it is not prohibited by the act 1696 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bruce, January 1. 1717, Burgh contra Gray.</NOTE>. Very true. But then, as above demon&s;trated, it is prohibited by ju|&s;tice and by utility; and upon the&s;e <HI>media</HI> it ought to have been void|ed. The court went &s;till farther, by &s;u&s;taining a bond for money lent to a known bankrupt <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, June 28. 1665, Monteith contra Ander&s;on.</NOTE>. Upon the &s;tatute 1696 it has been di&s;|puted, whether an act be challengeable where no &s;ubject is aliened, and yet a partial preference is given. The ca&s;e was as follows. An heir&punc;apparent having given infeftments of annualrent, did thereafter grant a procuratory to &s;erve him&s;elf heir, that his infeftment might accre&s;ce to the annualrent-rights. In a competition between the&s;e an|nualrenters and po&s;terior adjudgers, it was objected again&s;t the pro|curatory, That it was granted by a notour bankrupt, and therefore null by the &s;tatute 1696; the purpo&s;e of which is to annul every par|tial preference by a bankrupt, direct or indirect. It was an&s;wered, That the &s;tatute mentions only alienations made by the bankrupt, and reaches not every act that may be attended with a con&s;equential da|mage or benefit to &s;ome of the creditors. The court preferred the an|nualrenters <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">February 1728, Creditors of Graitney competing.</NOTE>. Had the &s;ervuce been before the bankruptcy, there could be no rea&s;on in equity again&s;t it: but a man, who, con&s;cious of his own bankruptcy, performs any act in order to prefer one cre|ditor before another, is unju&s;t; and the creditor who takes advantage of that act, knowing his debtor to be bankrupt, is partaker of the wrong. The court therefore denying a remedy in this ca&s;e, acted as a court of common law, overlooking its equitable powers.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to the foregoing in&s;tances, I &s;hall mention fir&s;t a donation, the motive of which is love and favour to the donee, without any formed intention to wrong the creditors, though in effect they are wronged by it. That this ca&s;e is not provided for in the &s;tatue 1621, is evident from every clau&s;e in it. Fraud only is repre&s;&s;ed: not fraud in a lax &s;en&s;e, &s;ignifying every moral wrong by which a creditor is di&s;appointed of his payment; but fraud in its proper &s;en&s;e, &s;ignifying a deliberate purpo&s;e to cheat creditors; that &s;ort of fraud which is cri|minal
<PB N="321" REF="330">
and merits puni&s;hment: which is put beyond doubt by the fi|nal clau&s;e, inflicting a puni&s;hment fully adequate to fraud in its pro|per &s;en&s;e. But a gratuitous bond or alienation, of which the inten|tion is preci&s;ely what is &s;poke out, without any purpo&s;e to cover the effects from the creditors, is not a fraud in any proper &s;en&s;e, at lea&s;t not in a &s;en&s;e to merit puni&s;hment. This then is left upon equity: and the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, directed by the great principle of equity <HI>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura,</HI> makes no difficulty to cut down a gratuitous bond or alienation granted by a bankrupt. With re&s;pect to a gratuitous bond, the court I believe has gone father: it has preferred the creditors upon an eventual bankruptcy, even where the granter was &s;olvent when he made the donation. And indeed the court cannot do otherwi&s;e, without deviating from the principle now mentioned.</P>
<P>Next comes a &s;ecurity given by a bankrupt in &s;uch circum&s;tances as not to be challengeable upon either of the &s;tatutes, being given, for example, before execution is commenced again&s;t the bankrupt, and more than &s;ixty days before his bankruptcy becomes notorious. It is made out above, that a court of equity ought to void &s;uch a &s;ecurity, even though the creditor, ignorant of his debtor's bankruptcy, ob|tained the &s;ame <HI>bona fide.</HI> The court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, it is true, hath not hitherto ventured to adopt this equitable regulation in its full extent; but the court hath made vigorous approaches to it, by voiding &s;uch &s;ecurity where-ever any collateral circum&s;tance could be found that appeared to weigh in any degree again&s;t the creditor. Thus, a &s;ecu|rity given by a bankrupt to one of his creditors, who was his near re|lation, was voided, though the di&s;po&s;ition came not under either of the bankrupt-&s;tatutes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, January 28. 1696, Scrymzcour contra Lyon.</NOTE>. In the &s;ame manner, a di&s;po&s;ition <HI>omnium bonorum,</HI> as a &s;ecurity to a &s;ingle creditor, is always voided. And here it merits ob&s;ervation, that the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion acting upon prin|ciples of equity, is more correct in its decrees, than where it acts by authority of the &s;tatutes; witne&s;s the following ca&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"A debtor again&s;t whom no execution was commenced, having granted a di&s;|po&s;ition <HI>omnium bonorum</HI> as a &s;ecurity to one of his creditors, another creditor arre&s;ted in the di&s;ponee's hands, and in the forthcoming in&s;i&s;ted, that the di&s;po&s;ition was null, and that the &s;ubject ought to be made forthcoming to him upon his arre&s;tment. The court reduced to the effect of bringing in the arre&s;ter <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">February 25. 1737, Cramond contra Bruce.</NOTE>."</Q> The
<PB N="322" REF="331">
following ca&s;e, though varying in circum&s;tances, is built upon the preci&s;e &s;ame foundation. Robert Grant, con&s;cious of his in&s;olvency, and re&s;olving to prefer his favourite creditors, executed privately in their favour a &s;ecurity upon his land-e&s;tate, which in the &s;ame pri|vate manner he completed by infeftment. This &s;ecurity being kept latent, even from tho&s;e for whom it was intended, gave no alarm, and Robert Grant did not become a notour bankrupt for many months thereafter. But the peculiar circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e, a real &s;ecurity be&s;tow'd on creditors who were not making any demand, &s;ei|&s;in given clande&s;tinely, &amp;c. were clear evidence of the granter's con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his bankruptcy, as well as of his intention to act par|tially and unju&s;tly among his creditors; and the court accordingly voided the &s;ecurity as far as it gave preference to the creditors therein named; <HI>November</HI> 10. 1748, <HI>Sir Archibald Grant contra Grant of Lurg.</HI></P>
<P>After fini&s;hing the in&s;tances promi&s;ed, another point demands our attention. With re&s;pect to an alienation bearing to be granted for love and favour, or made to a near relation, and therefore in ca&s;e of bankruptcy pre&s;umed gratuitous, a doctrine e&s;tabli&s;hed in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion by a train of deci&s;ions, appears &s;ingular. It is held, that the purcha&s;er from &s;uch di&s;ponee, though he pay a full price, is in no better condition than his author, and that a reduction at the in|&s;tance of the bankrupt's creditors will reach both equally. This doc|trine ought not to pa&s;s current without examination, for its con&s;e|quences are terrible. At that rate, every &s;ubject acquired upon a lu|crative title is withdrawn from commerce for the &s;pace at lea&s;t of for|ty years. What &s;hall become of tho&s;e who purcha&s;e from heirs if this doctrine hold? And if a purcha&s;er from an heir of provi&s;ion, for example, be &s;ecure, why not a purcha&s;er from a gratuitous di&s;|ponee? What objection &s;hould lie again&s;t the purcha&s;er is not ob|vious, con&s;idering that a purcha&s;er even from a notour bankrupt is, in the practice of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, held to be &s;ecure; which is at lea&s;t a good <HI>argumentum ad hominem.</HI> The only rea&s;on urged in &s;up|port of this doctrine is, That a purcha&s;er cannot pretend to be <HI>in bona+fide</HI> when his author's right appears to be gratuitous, or is pre&s;umed gratuitous. I cannot perceive the weight of this rea&s;on. It is ob|vious to an&s;wer in the fir&s;t place, That if we adhere to the act 1621, there can be no foundation for &s;uch reduction: for if, even in the ca&s;e of a fraudulent conveyance to an interpo&s;ed per&s;on, a purcha&s;er <HI>bona+fide</HI> from that per&s;on be &s;ecure, what doubt can there be that a pur|cha&s;er from a gratuitous di&s;ponee is al&s;o &s;ecure, where the gratuitous
<PB N="323" REF="332">
di&s;ponee is innocent of any fraud? In the next place, Con&s;idering this matter upon the principles of equity, a gratuitous deed is not &s;ubject to reduction unle&s;s granted by a bankrupt; and to put a man who purcha&s;es from a gratuitous di&s;ponee <HI>in mala fide,</HI> the bankruptcy ought to be known to him as well as that his author's title is gratui|tous. And yet I find not that the purcha&s;er's knowledge of the bank|ruptcy has ever been held a nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tance; one ca&s;e except|ed, reported by Fountainhall <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">November 28. 1693, Spence contra Creditors of Dick.</NOTE>: <Q REND="inline">"It is not &s;ufficient to reduce the pur|cha&s;er's right that he knew his author's relation to the bankrupt, unle&s;s he was al&s;o in the knowledge of the bankruptcy; becau&s;e there is no law to bar a man in good circum&s;tances from making a donation to a near relation. And knowledge, an internal act, mu&s;t be gathered from circum&s;tances, the mo&s;t pregnant of which is, that the granter of the gratuitous deed was at the time held and reputed a bankrupt."</Q> But, in the third place, Suppo&s;ing the bank|ruptcy known to the purcha&s;er, I deny that this circum&s;tance can &s;upport the reduction either at common law or in equity: it is made evident above, that a gratuitous di&s;ponee ignorant of his author's bankruptcy, is not bound to yield the &s;ubject to the bankrupt's cre|ditors, but only to account to them for the value; and when he di&s;|po&s;es of the &s;ubject for a full price, this &s;ale, &s;o far from di&s;appoint|ing the obligation he is under to the bankrupt's creditors, enables him to perform it. In one ca&s;e only will the purcha&s;er's right be voided in equity; and that is where the gratuitous di&s;ponee and the purcha&s;er from him are both of them <HI>in mala fide:</HI> a man who takes a gratuitous di&s;po&s;ition knowing his author to be bankrupt, is guilty of a wrong, which binds him in con&s;cience to re&s;tore the &s;ubject it&s;elf to the bankrupt's creditors; and the per&s;on who purcha&s;es from him knowing that he is &s;o bound, being al&s;o guilty, is for that rea&s;on bound equally to re&s;tore.</P>
<P>The &s;tatute 1696, voiding all di&s;po&s;itions, a&s;&s;ignments, or other deeds, granted by a bankrupt to a favourite creditor, &s;eems to have no &s;ubjects in view but what are locally in Scotland, within the juri&s;|diction of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. And indeed it would be fruitle&s;s to void a di&s;po&s;ition granted by a Scotch bankrupt of his foreign effects; becau&s;e &s;uch effects will be regulated by the law of the place, and not by a decree pronounced in Scotland. Suppo&s;ing then &s;uch a di&s;po&s;i|tion to be granted, is there no remedy? It is certainly a moral wrong for a bankrupt to convey to one of his creditors what ought to be di&s;|tributed
<PB N="324" REF="333">
among all; and the creditor who accepts &s;uch &s;ecurity knowing his debtor's in&s;olvency, is acce&s;&s;ory to the wrong. Upon this ground, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, though they cannot void the &s;ecuri|ty, may, as a court of equity, ordain the favourite creditor to repair the lo&s;s that the other creditors have &s;u&s;tained by it; which will ob|lige the favourite creditor either to &s;urrender the effects, or to be ac|countable for the value. And this was decreed in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, July 18. 1758, Robert Syme clerk to the &s;ignet contra George Thom|&s;on tenant in Dalhou&s;ie.</P>
<P>Of late years it has been much controverted, whether a di&s;po&s;ition <HI>omnium bonorum</HI> by a notour bankrupt to tru&s;tees for behoof of his whole creditors, be voidable upon the bankrupt-&s;tatutes. Formerly &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions were &s;u&s;tained, as not being prohibited by any clau&s;e in either of the &s;tatutes. But the court at la&s;t &s;ettled in the follow|ing opinion, <Q REND="inline">"That no di&s;po&s;ition by a bankrupt can di&s;able his cre|ditors from doing diligence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">July 12. 1734, Snee contra Tru&s;tees of Ander&s;on. Feb. 3. 1736, Earl of Aberdeen con|tra Tru&s;tees of Blair.</NOTE>."</Q> This opinion, founded on ju&s;tice and expediency, though not upon the bankrupt-&s;tatutes, ought to govern the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion as a court of equity. It belongs not to the bankrupt, though proprietor, to direct the management of his funds; but to his creditors, who are more intere&s;ted in that manage|ment than he is. It belongs therefore to the creditors to direct the method by which the funds &s;hall be turned into money for their pay|ment; and if they chu&s;e to have the effects managed by tru&s;tees, it is their privilege, not the bankrupt's, to name the tru&s;tees. It fol|lows, however, from this con&s;ideration, that tho&s;e tru&s;t-rights only which are impo&s;ed by bankrupts upon their creditors, ought to be voided. There lies evidently no objection, either at common law or in equity, again&s;t a di&s;po&s;ition <HI>omnium bonorum</HI> &s;olicited by the credi|tors, and granted by the bankrupt to tru&s;tees of their naming. On the contrary, a tru&s;t-right of that nature, which &s;aves the nomina|tion of a <HI>curator bonis,</HI> as in Rome, or of commi&s;&s;ioners, as in Eng|land, merits the greate&s;t favour, being an expeditious and frugal method of managing the bankrupt's funds for behoof of his creditors. And &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a mea&s;ure to be concerted among the bulk of the creditors, a court of equity ought not to regard a few di&s;&s;enting creditors who incline to follow &s;eparate mea&s;ures. The tru&s;t-right is good at common law, being an alienation by a proprietor; and it is good in equity as being a ju&s;t act. It mu&s;t accordingly afford a pre|ference
<PB N="325" REF="334">
to the creditors who lay hold of it. A di&s;&s;enting creditor may, if he plea&s;e, proceed to execution again&s;t his debtor, and he may at|tach the imaginary rever&s;ion implied in the tru&s;t-di&s;po&s;ition: but &s;uch peevi&s;h mea&s;ures cannot hurt the other creditors who are &s;ecured by the tru&s;t-right; for if that right be not voidable, it mu&s;t be preferred before an adjudication, or any other execution, at the in&s;tance of a di&s;&s;enting creditor.</P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Powers and Faculties.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY right, real or per&s;onal, is a legal power to perform certain acts. In this exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e there are numberle&s;s powers. E|very individual hath power over his own property, and over his own per&s;on; &s;ome over another's property or per&s;on. To trace all the&s;e powers would be the &s;ame with writing a body of law. The powers under con&s;ideration are of a &s;ingular kind. They are not rights, properly &s;peaking, but they are means by which rights can be created, a power, for example, to make a man debtor for a &s;um, a power to charge his land with debt, a power to redeem land from the purcha&s;er.</P>
<P>The&s;e powers are of two kinds; powers that ari&s;e from con&s;ent merely, and powers that ari&s;e from property. Where a man di&s;pones his e&s;tate to his heir ab&s;olutely and irredeemably, impowering a third per&s;on to charge the heir or the land with a &s;um, this is an example of the fir&s;t kind: a power thus created is founded on the con&s;ent of the heir, &s;ignified by his acceptance of the di&s;po&s;ition. A power re|&s;erved in a &s;ettlement of a land-e&s;tate, to alter the &s;ettlement, or to burden the land with debt, is an example of the other kind: by &s;uch &s;ettlement the property is under&s;tood to be re&s;erved to the maker, as far as to impower him to alter or to burden. In this view, the&s;e powers may be termed <HI>per&s;onal</HI> and <HI>real.</HI></P>
<P>To explain a power of the fir&s;t kind, which is properly termed <HI>a facul|ty,</HI> in contradi&s;tinction to a power founded on property, it mu&s;t be con|&s;idered, 1 <HI>mo,</HI> That with regard to pecuniary intere&s;t, a man may &s;ubject him&s;elf to the power of another: he may gratuitou&s;ly bind him&s;elf to pay a &s;um of money; or he may impower any per&s;on to burden him with a &s;um. 2<HI>do,</HI> He may al&s;o &s;ubject his property to the power of another: a proprietor can impower any per&s;on to charge his land
<PB N="326" REF="335">
with an infeftment of annualrent; and a real right thus e&s;tabli&s;hed is good even at common law. Thus it is laid down by our writers, that the proprietor's con&s;ent will validate a re&s;ignation made by one who hath no right <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, tit. Extinction of infeftments, &sect; 7.</NOTE>, and will validate al&s;o an annualrent-right granted by one who is not proprietor <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Durie, Dec. 15. 1630, Stirling contra tenants.</NOTE>. 3<HI>tio,</HI> Though an annual|rent-right thus granted by a per&s;on having a faculty to burden the land, is a real right, not le&s;s complete than if granted by the pro|prietor; yet the faculty it&s;elf is not a real right: it may indeed be exerted while the granter continues proprietor; his con&s;ent makes it effectual: but his con&s;ent cannot operate after he is dive&s;ted of his property, more than if he never had been proprietor: in that ca&s;e it is a con&s;ent by one to burden the property of another; an act that can have no effect in law. Thus a power granted by a proprietor to charge his land with a certain &s;um, cea&s;es by his &s;elling the land be|fore the faculty is exerted. Nor in &s;trict law can &s;uch faculty be exerted after the granter's death. Whether equity may not in this ca&s;e interpo&s;e, is more doubtful. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that a man makes a deed, impowering certain per&s;ons to name provi&s;ions to his young|er children after his death, and to burden his heir and land-e&s;tate with the payment; leaving at the &s;ame time his e&s;tate to de&s;cend to his heir at law by the cour&s;e of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This deed cannot be effectual at common law; becau&s;e it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of property that a burden can be impo&s;ed upon the e&s;tate of any man without his con&s;ent. It &s;eems however ju&s;t, that a court of equity &s;hould interpo&s;e to make &s;o rational a faculty effectual again&s;t the heir, though not to charge the e&s;tate. The faculty, it is true, can|not be con&s;idered as a debt due by the ance&s;tor to &s;ubject the heir by repre&s;entation: but it is the will of the ance&s;tor to burden the heir with provi&s;ions to his younger children; and in equity the will of the ance&s;tor ought to be a law to the heir who &s;ucceeds by that very will, implied though not expre&s;&s;ed. In the law of England accor|dingly, where lands are devi&s;ed to be &s;old for younger childrens portions, and the executor dies without &s;elling, the heir is compelled to &s;ell. And where lands were ordered to be &s;old for payment of debts, without impowering any per&s;on to &s;ell, it was decreed that the heir &s;hould &s;ell <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1. Chancery ca&s;es 176.</NOTE>. But a &s;ettlement of an e&s;tate made by the proprietor upon any of his blood-relations that his wife &s;hould think proper to nominate after his death, is effectual at common law: for
<PB N="327" REF="336">
there is nothing in rea&s;on or in law to bar a proprietor from making a &s;ettlement upon any per&s;on he has a mind, whether named by him&s;elf, or by another having his authority.

<P>That &s;ort of power which is a branch of property, is in a very dif|ferent condition. It is in its nature effectual again&s;t all &s;ingular &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, even <HI>bona &s;ide</HI> purcha&s;ers; for a di&s;ponee to whom the property is conveyed to a limited effect only, cannot be&s;tow upon another a more exten&s;ive right than he him&s;elf has.</P>
<P>It may be laid down as a general rule, That powers re&s;erved in a di&s;po&s;ition of land, the mo&s;t limited as well as the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, are all of them branches of the property. To verify this rule, it mu&s;t be premi&s;ed, that all the powers a man hath over his own &s;ubject are involved in his right of property; and that the meaning of a re&s;er|vation, is not to create a new right, but only to limit the right that is convey'd. From the&s;e premi&s;es it clearly follows, that the re&s;erva|tion of any power over the land mu&s;t &s;o far imply a re&s;ervation of the property: and this mu&s;t hold, however limited the re&s;erved power be, or however exten&s;ive, unle&s;s it be expre&s;&s;ed in clear terms, that a faculty only is intended. A &s;eparate argument concurs for this rule. Human nature, which, in matters of intere&s;t, makes a man generally prefer him&s;elf before others, founds a natural, and therefore a legal, pre&s;umption, that when a di&s;poner re&s;erves to him|&s;elf any power over the &s;ubject di&s;poned, his intention is to re&s;erve it in the ample&s;t and mo&s;t effectual manner. And hence, <HI>in dubio,</HI> the pre&s;umption will lie for a power properly &s;o called, in oppo&s;ition to a faculty. Thus a re&s;erved power to charge the e&s;tate di&s;poned with a &s;um, though the mo&s;t limited power that can be re&s;erved, is held to be a re&s;ervation of the property, &s;o as to make the re&s;erved power good even again&s;t a purcha&s;er from the di&s;ponee. A man di&s;poned his e&s;tate to his elde&s;t &s;on, re&s;erving a power <Q REND="inline">"to affect or burden the &s;ame with a &s;um named for provi&s;ions to his children."</Q> The &s;on's creditors appri&s;ed the e&s;tate, and were infeft. Thereafter the di&s;poner exerted his re&s;erved power, by granting to his children heritable bonds, upon which they al&s;o were infeft; and in a compe|tition they were preferred <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, Dirleton, Jan. 6. 1677, Creditors of Mou&s;well contra Children.

<P>But though a faculty regularly exerted while the granter conti|nues proprietor, will lay a burden on the land effectual again&s;t pur|cha&s;ers, and though a power will have the &s;ame effect at whatever time exerted, it follows not that every exertion of a power or fa|culty will be &s;o effectual: which leads us to examine in what man|ner they mu&s;t be exerted in order to be effectual again&s;t purcha&s;ers. That land may be charged with debt without infeftment, or with|out giving a title in the feudal form, is evident from a rent-charge, and from a clau&s;e in a conveyance of land burdening the land with a certain &s;um <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 4. p. 244.</NOTE>. That without infeftment &s;uch a burden may be laid on land by means of a power or faculty to burden, &s;eems equal|ly con&s;i&s;tent; and were there a record of bonds granted in pur&s;uance of &s;uch powers, there would be nothing repugnant to utility more than to law in &s;u&s;taining them as real rights. But as no record is appointed for bonds of this kind, it is a wi&s;e and &s;alutary regula|tion to &s;u&s;tain none of them as real rights, unle&s;s where created in the feudal form to produce infeftment; which brings them under the &s;tatute 1617, requiring all &s;ei&s;ins to be recorded. Where land &s;tands charged with a &s;um by virtue of a clau&s;e contained in the di&s;po&s;ition, no inconvenience ari&s;es from &s;upporting this right, according to its nature, again&s;t all &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; for a purcha&s;er from the di&s;|ponee is put upon his guard by the di&s;po&s;ition containing the burden, which di&s;po&s;ition makes part of his title-deeds. But a power or fa|culty, could it be exerted without infeftment, might occa&s;ion great imbarra&s;&s;ment: the power or faculty, it is true, appears on the face of the di&s;po&s;ition, which is a title-deed that mu&s;t be delivered to a purcha&s;er; but then a purcha&s;er has no means to di&s;cover whether the power or faculty be exerted, or to what extent. Nay further, if a &s;imple bond be held an exertion, there can be no limitation: for bonds referring to the faculty may be granted for L. 10,000, though the faculty be limited to the twentieth part of that &s;um. And &s;uch uncertainty would put the land <HI>extra commercium</HI> du|ring

the &s;pace of the long pre&s;cription, commencing at the death of the di&s;poner, who re&s;erved to him&s;elf the power of burdening the land. The foregoing regulation is accordingly in &s;trict ob&s;ervance. By the deci&s;ion mentioned above, Creditors of Mou&s;well <HI>contra</HI> Chil|dren, it appears, that when a re&s;erved power to burden land is regu|larly exerted, by granting an infeftment of annualrent, &s;uch annual|rent-right is preferred even before a prior infeftment derived from the di&s;ponee: but a &s;imple bond is never &s;o preferred. Thus a man who di&s;poned his e&s;tate to his elde&s;t &s;on, re&s;erving to him&s;elf a power to burden the &s;ame with 5000 merks, granted thereafter &s;imple bonds for that &s;um to his wife and children, proceeding upon the narra|tive of the re&s;erved power. After the date of the&s;e bonds, the di&s;|ponee contracted debts, which were e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the e&s;tate by in|feftments. A competition ari&s;ing between the&s;e two &s;ets of creditors after the di&s;poner's decea&s;e, the di&s;ponee's creditors were preferred upon their infeftments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">June 26. 1735, Ogilvies contra Turnbull.</NOTE>.

But where the di&s;poner re&s;erves a power to burden the land with a &s;um to one per&s;on named, the heir-male of a &s;econd mar|riage for example, and thereafter grants a &s;imple bond to that per&s;on referring to the re&s;erved power; it &s;eems not unrea&s;onable that this bond &s;hould be deemed a real burden effectual again&s;t purcha&s;ers. For here there is no uncertainty to put the land <HI>extra commercium:</HI> the burden can never exceed the &s;um &s;pecified in the di&s;po&s;ition; and after the di&s;poner's death, a purcha&s;er, by inquiring at the per&s;on na|med, has acce&s;s to know whether and to what extent the power has been exerted.</P>
<P>If the foregoing regulation hold in re&s;erved powers, there can be no doubt of it with re&s;pect to faculties properly &s;o called. The fol|lowing deci&s;ions I think belong to this cla&s;s.

This is properly an in&s;tance of a faculty, be|cau&s;e the power which the father provided to him&s;elf could not be founded on the property which was never in him. Again, a pur|cha&s;er of land having taken the di&s;po&s;ition to him&s;elf in liferent, and to his &s;on <HI>nominatim</HI> in fee, with a faculty <Q REND="inline">"to burden, contract debt, and to &s;ell or otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;e at his plea&s;ure,"</Q> did fir&s;t grant a &s;imple bond, declaring it a burden on the land, and there|after &s;old the land.

<P>The ca&s;es above mentioned are governed by the rules of the com|mon law: and as a <HI>bona fide</HI> purcha&s;e for a valuable con&s;ideration is the highe&s;t title of property, this title, if good at common law, will never be impugned in equity; and for that rea&s;on, a power to bur|den, when it enters the li&s;ts again&s;t &s;uch a purcha&s;e, is confined within the narrowe&s;t bounds. A faculty to impo&s;e a per&s;onal bur|den, &s;tands upon more advantageous ground: where a valuable con|&s;ideration has been given, it is &s;upported in equity beyond the bounds of common law. In particular, where the will of the per|&s;on who re&s;erves the faculty appears to be more exten&s;ive than the re&s;erving words, equity interpo&s;es to give the faculty its intended ef|fect. Thus in a gratuitous di&s;po&s;ition of a land-e&s;tate, a power re|&s;erved to burden the &s;ame with &s;ums to a certain extent, has evi|dently a valuable con&s;ideration; and yet this power will not at com|mon law intitle the di&s;poner to &s;ubject the di&s;ponee per&s;onally: but the di&s;ponee will be liable in equity, becau&s;e it could not have been the intention of the di&s;poner, re&s;erving power over the land, to ex|clude him&s;elf from a power of burdening al&s;o the di&s;ponee; and therefore it mu&s;t have been an over&s;ight in the writing that power was not re&s;erved to burden the di&s;ponee as well as the land. And hence in the deci&s;ions above mentioned, Rome contra Creditors of Graham, Sinclair contra Sinclair of Barrack, and Ogilvies contra Turnbull, though a &s;imple bond granted in pur&s;uance of a power to burden the land was held not to be a real right; it was held how|ever, from the implied will of the decea&s;ed, to be a burden upon the di&s;ponee per&s;onally. And in like manner, a &s;imple bond grant|ed in pur&s;uance of a re&s;erved power to burden the land di&s;poned, was found effectual again&s;t the di&s;ponee per&s;onally, &s;o as to &s;upport

But a faculty granted to a third per&s;on for his own be|hoof without any valuable con&s;ideration, is in a different condition: he is <HI>in pari ca&s;u</HI> with the di&s;ponee, the rights of both being by &s;up|po&s;ition gratuitous. In this ca&s;e it appears that the faculty ought not to be extended beyond the words of the grant.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing now a &s;imple bond to be granted without referring to the re&s;erved faculty, will this bond be in equity deemed an exertion of the faculty, yea or not? If the granter have no other fund of payment, this circum&s;tance infers a rational pre&s;umption that he in|tended an exertion of the faculty: if he have a &s;eparate fund, the pre&s;umption cea&s;es, and that fund only mu&s;t be attached for pay|ment. But again, what if the &s;eparate fund be not altogether &s;uffi|cient? In this ca&s;e a court of equity may ju&s;tly interpo&s;e to make what is deficient effectual by means of the re&s;erved faculty, in order to fulfil the will of the per&s;on who granted the bond. Thus a man, upon the narrative of love and favour, having di&s;poned his e&s;tate to his elde&s;t &s;on, re&s;erving a power to burden the e&s;tate to the extent of a &s;um named, granted thereafter a per&s;onal bond of provi&s;ion to his children without any relation to the re&s;erved power. In a &s;uit for payment again&s;t the di&s;ponee's repre&s;entatives it was objected, That the di&s;poner at the date of the bond had an opulent fund of move|ables, and that there is no pre&s;umption he intended to charge with this debt either his &s;on or the e&s;tate di&s;poned. The di&s;poner&punc;s will was pre&s;umed to be, that the bond &s;hould burden his executors in the fir&s;t place, and the di&s;ponee in the &s;econd place <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, Dirleton, June 21. 1677, Hope-Pringle contra Hope-Pringle.</NOTE>. By marriage-articles the e&s;tate was provided to heirs-male, with power to burden the e&s;tate with a &s;um named for the heirs of a &s;econd marriage. The proprietor contracting a &s;econd marriage, made a provi&s;ion for the children of that marriage, burdening his heir with the &s;ame, but not charging his e&s;tate in terms of the re&s;erved power. At common law the e&s;tate was not &s;ubjected, becau&s;e the provi&s;ion was not made a burden upon it; nor was the heir &s;ubjected, becau&s;e the re&s;erved power intitled the granter to burden the e&s;tate only. The court &s;teered a right cour&s;e in equity: the heir was made liable <HI>ultimo loco</HI> after his father's other e&s;tate &s;hould be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, Dalrymple, June 23. 1698, Carnegie contra Laird Kin&s;auns.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It has been que&s;tioned, whether a re&s;erved power to charge with a &s;um the land di&s;poned, can benefit a creditor who&s;e debt was con|tracted before the re&s;erved power was created. The court thought
<PB N="332" REF="341">
it rea&s;onable that this power &s;hould be &s;ubjected to the di&s;poner's debts, whether prior or po&s;terior <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, Dalrymple Dec. 16. 1698, Eliot of Swin&s;ide contra Eliot of Meikle-dean.</NOTE>. But it is certainly a mi&s;take in principles to &s;ubject a power or faculty, like a <HI>corpus,</HI> to the payment of debt. A power to charge an e&s;tate with debt, being &s;trictly per|&s;onal, is incommunicable to a creditor or to any other, even during the life of the per&s;on privileged; not to talk of his or her death. E|quity however rules, that a power or faculty &s;hould be available to creditors, prior as well as po&s;terior: for it is the duty of a debtor to u&s;e all lawful means for paying his debts, whether by &s;elling his goods or exerting his faculties; and if he unju&s;tly refu&s;e, equity will hold the faculty as exerted for the benefit of the creditors. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the creditors will have acce&s;s to the land for their pay|ment, as if the debtor had exerci&s;ed his faculty, and burdened the land with the &s;um mentioned, payable to them. But if the credi|tors lie dormant during their debtor's life, and make no &s;tep to avail them&s;elves of his re&s;erved faculty, the faculty dies with him, and they can take nothing by it. A man di&s;poned to his &s;ons of the &s;e|cond marriage &s;everal parcels of land, <Q REND="inline">"re&s;erving to him&s;elf full power and faculty to alter and innovate, and to contract debt as fully and freely as if the entire fee were in him."</Q> The que&s;tion occurred, Whether the&s;e di&s;ponees were liable to their father's per|&s;onal debts contracted before the exi&s;tence of the &s;aid power; and the affirmative was decreed <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">July 21. 1724, Creditors of Ru&s;co contra Blair of Senwick.</NOTE>. But in ca&s;es of this nature, the di&s;|ponee, even where he is heir-apparent, is liable <HI>in valorem</HI> only <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple, January 18. 1717, Abercrombie contra Graham.</NOTE>: for the di&s;ponee is not liable at common law; and equity &s;ubjects no man farther than <HI>in valorem</HI> of the &s;ubject he receives.</P>
<P>The exertion of a re&s;erved power to charge land with a &s;um, re|quires a formal deed; becau&s;e every act of will concerning land, conveying the property or burdening it, mu&s;t be declared by a for|mal writing: but the exertion of a faculty to charge a man per&s;o|nally with a &s;um, &s;eems not to require writing. It is &s;ufficient that the act of will be proved by witne&s;&s;es or other &s;atisfactory evidence. Thus a man &s;ettled his e&s;tate on his elde&s;t &s;on, re&s;erving a power, by deed or will under &s;eal, to charge the land with any &s;um not ex|ceeding L. 500. He prepares a deed appointing the L. 500 to his younger children, and gets it ingro&s;&s;ed, but dies before it is &s;igned or &s;ealed. This in equity &s;hall amount to a good execution of his power, the &s;ub&s;tance being performed <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Abridg&punc; ca&s;es in equity, chap. 44. &s;ect.

but by a formal deed; becau&s;e what is required by common law cannot be overturned by a court of equity: but this court may &s;up|ply a defect in common law, by &s;ubjecting the heir per&s;onally upon an incompleted deed, which, though not regarded at common law, is &s;atisfactory evidence of will. In one ca&s;e the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion made a much wider &s;tep, which was to find the di&s;ponee liable for the &s;um in a re&s;erved power, though the di&s;poner had not u&s;ed his power by granting a bond, nor &s;o much as &s;howed any will to ex|ert it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gosford, February 15. 1673, Graham contra Lord Morphey.</NOTE>.

<P>Whether and in what ca&s;es a re&s;erved power or faculty can effec|tually be exerci&s;ed on deathbed, has frequently been agitated in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. One point appears clear, that a re&s;erved power to alter or burden on deathbed, contained in a di&s;po&s;ition to a &s;tranger, may be exerci&s;ed on deathbed, &s;uppo&s;ing always the granter to be <HI>&s;anae mentis.</HI> And the rea&s;on is, that the &s;tranger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">aying hold of the di&s;po&s;ition, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to its qualities, and cannot object to the
<PB N="334" REF="343">
conditions upon which it is granted. The great difficulty is where the &s;ettlement is upon the heir, who is <HI>alioqui &s;ucce&s;&s;urus;</HI> as to which our deci&s;ions &s;eem not to be uniform, nor any good rule laid down by our writers. If the heir have not by acceptance of the di&s;po&s;ition con&s;ented to the burdening clau&s;e, his privilege of challenging a bur|den laid upon him on deathbed, remains entire. But if he have taken infeftment upon the di&s;po&s;ition, and be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which implies his con&s;ent to every clau&s;e in the deed, will not this con&s;ent bar him from objecting to the faculty, though exerted on deathbed? This requires deliberation. What di&s;tingui&s;hes an heir from a &s;tran|ger is his dependence upon the predece&s;&s;or for the e&s;tate, leaving him no freedom of choice: he mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the will of his pre|dece&s;&s;or under the peril of exheredation. But does this dependence pre&s;ume co-action in every tran&s;action between a man and his heir? This can hardly be maintained; for what if the re&s;erved faculty be to burden the e&s;tate with a moderate provi&s;ion to younger children, or to do any other pious or rational act? In &s;uch a ca&s;e, no good man would with-hold his con&s;ent; and therefore in &s;uch a ca&s;e there is no ground for pre&s;uming the heir's con&s;ent to have been extorted from him. This hint leads us to a di&s;tinction in an&s;wering the foregoing que&s;tion. If the heir's con&s;ent be voluntary, &s;uch as he would have given in a &s;tate of independence, it mu&s;t be effectual both in law and equity to &s;upport the deathbed-deed. If it be ex|torted by fear of exheredation, it may be good at common law, but it will be voided by a court of equity.</P>
<P>But this di&s;tinction, however clear in theory, &s;eems to be not a little difficult in practice; for what criterion have we for judging in what ca&s;es this con&s;ent is voluntary, in what ca&s;es extorted? The expi&s;cation may be intricate, but it is nece&s;&s;ary. Where a man &s;et|tles his e&s;tate upon his elde&s;t &s;on with a re&s;erved power to alter even on deathbed, no rational man will willingly &s;ubmit to be in &s;o preca|rious a &s;tate; and therefore the heir's con&s;ent will be pre&s;umed the ef|fect of extortion. On the other hand, where a man, &s;ettling his e|&s;tate upon his elde&s;t &s;on, re&s;erves only power to burden it with a mo|derate &s;um to his younger children, this is a fair &s;ettlement, by which the heir gets more than he gives; and therefore his con&s;ent may &s;afe|ly be pre&s;umed voluntary. Hence in general, the heir's con&s;ent to a re&s;erved power that bears hard upon him, will always be pre&s;umed to have been extorted: his con&s;ent, on the contrary, to a re&s;erved power that is proper and rational, will always be pre&s;umed voluntary.</P>
<P>This di&s;tinction gives me the greater &s;atisfaction, when I find that it
<PB N="335" REF="344">
has had an influence upon the deci&s;ions of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, though perhaps imperceptibly. A re&s;erved power to alter upon deathbed a di&s;po&s;ition granted to an elde&s;t &s;on, has in no in&s;tance been &s;upport|ed again&s;t the heir's reduction, even where he accepted the di&s;po&s;i|tion. But the exerci&s;e upon deathbed of a re&s;erved power that is pro|per and rational has generally been &s;upported. Take the following examples. The exerci&s;e of a re&s;erved faculty to burden with a mo|derate &s;um an e&s;tate di&s;poned to an heir, was &s;u&s;tained, though the faculty was exerted upon deathbed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, June 28. 1662, Hay contra Seton.

<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this chapter with a &s;eparate point, concerning powers given to a plurality, whether in exerci&s;ing &s;uch powers the whole mu&s;t concur, or what number le&s;s than the whole may be &s;ufficient. If the per&s;ons be named jointly, the will of the granter is clear, that the whole mu&s;t concur, becau&s;e &s;uch is the import of the word <HI>jointly.</HI> To &s;ay that any number le&s;s than the whole may be &s;ufficient, is in other words to &s;ay, that a nomination to act jointly is the &s;ame with a nomination to act &s;eparately.</P>
<P>But though all mu&s;t concur, it follows not that they mu&s;t all agree. If they be all pre&s;ent, the will of the maker naming them jointly is fulfilled; and what remains is, that the opinion of the majority mu&s;t govern the whole body. <Q REND="inline">"Cel&s;us, lib. 2. Dige&s;torum, &s;cribit, Si in tres fuerit compromi&s;&s;um, &s;ufficere duorum con&s;en&s;um, &s;i prae&s;ens fuerit et tertius: alioquin, ab&s;ente eo, licet duo con&s;entiant, arbi|trium non valere; quia in plures fuit compromi&s;&s;um, et potuit prae&s;entia ejus trahere eos in ejus &s;ententiam.

De receptis qui arbitr.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The next que&s;tion is, When a plurality are named without adding the term <HI>jointly,</HI> what is the legal import of &s;uch nomination? Whe|ther is it under&s;tood the will of the maker that they mu&s;t act jointly, or may act &s;eparately? Stair<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Book 1. tit. 12. &sect; 13.</NOTE> re&s;olves this que&s;tion by an argument not le&s;s plain than per&s;ua&s;ive: <Q REND="inline">"A mandate (&s;ays he) given to ten
<PB N="336" REF="345">
cannot be under&s;tood as given to a le&s;&s;er number. To give a man|date to Titius, Seius, and Maevius, cannot be the &s;ame with giving it to any two of them."</Q> Hence it may be a&s;&s;umed as a rule at com|mon law, That a number of per&s;ons named in one deed to act in the &s;ame affair, are under&s;tood to be named jointly where the contrary is not expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>How far in this matter common law is &s;ubjected to the correction of equity, we next proceed to inquire. When a number of per&s;ons are named <HI>jointly</HI> to perform any work, the whole mu&s;t concur in e|quity as well as at common law. For here the will is clearly expre&s;|&s;ed, and a court of equity hath no power to vary from will. Thus two tutors being named <HI>jointly</HI> by a man to his heir, it was decreed, that the office was vacated by the death of one of them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, Jan. 17&punc; 1671, Drummond contra Feuers of Bothkennar.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A plurality named for carrying on any particular affair without the addition of <HI>jointly,</HI> affords a large field for equitable con&s;iderations. We have &s;een that at common law the term <HI>jointly</HI> is always implied or pre&s;umed. But in particular ca&s;es there are many circum&s;tances which a court of equity will lay hold of to overbalance this pre&s;ump|tion; to reduce which under any general rule is &s;earce practicable: circum&s;tances are &s;eldom preci&s;ely the &s;ame in any two ca&s;es, and for that rea&s;on each ca&s;e mu&s;t be ruled by its own circum&s;tances. All that can be &s;aid in general is, that the common law ought to take place, unle&s;s it can be clearly &s;hown that the maker did not intend to confine his nominees to act jointly.</P>
<P>Since general rules cannot be expected, what remains is to &s;tate ca&s;es the mo&s;t oppo&s;ed to each other, and which therefore admit of different con&s;iderations. And, in the fir&s;t place, If I name a plurali|ty to perform any act that is to bind or affect me, equity as well as common law requires that the nominees act jointly. In ca&s;es of that nature, there cannot readily occur any circum&s;tance to infer it to be my will that they may act &s;eparately: for if any one of the nominees refu&s;e to accept, or die after acceptance, it is my privilege to make a &s;econd nomination, or to forbear altogether; and it is not readily &s;uppo&s;eable that any man will give away his privilege, unle&s;s it be &s;o declared. Thus an award pronounced by two arbiters and an over&s;|man named by them, was declared void; becau&s;e it proceeded upon a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to four arbiters who were impowered to name an over&s;|man <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Foun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ainhall, Nov. 18. 1696, Wat&s;on contra Miln.</NOTE>.

This holds in curators, becau&s;e they are elected by the minor him&s;elf: if any of them refu&s;e to accept, or die after acceptance, it is no hard&s;hip that the nomination &s;hould be void, becau&s;e it is in the minor's power to renew the commi&s;&s;ion. But where the curators named are many in number, it will &s;carce be held the minor's intention to adhere to the common law by confining them to act jointly. In this ca&s;e it appears a more natural pre&s;ump|tion, that the purpo&s;e of naming &s;o great a number was to provide again&s;t death or non-acceptance. And accordingly an act of curato|ry was &s;u&s;tained, though &s;even only accepted of the eight that were named <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hope, (Minor), March 11. 1612, Airth.</NOTE>.

For here the will of the minor is expre&s;&s;ed in clear terms.</P>
<P>There is much greater latitude for interpretation of will with re|&s;pect to powers intended to be exerci&s;ed after the granter's death. Stair explains this matter extremely well in the following words: <Q REND="inline">"A mandate <HI>inter vivos</HI> giving power is &s;trictly to be interpreted, be|cau&s;e the nominees failing, the power returns to the mandant. But power given by a man in contemplation of death cannot re|turn, and therefore he is pre&s;umed to prefer all the per&s;ons nomi|nate to any other that may fall by cour&s;e of law <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Book 1. tit. 12. &sect; 13.</NOTE>."</Q> This doc|trine is finely illu&s;trated by a nomination of tutors. Where they are named jointly, each mu&s;t concur in every act, and con&s;equently the death or non-acceptance of any one voids the nomination; for &s;uch is the meaning of a joint commi&s;&s;ion to a plurality: but where a number of tutors are named without adding the term <HI>jointly,</HI> the tutory is &s;upported by an equitable interpretation while any one re|mains alive: the preference given to them &s;hows it to be the will of the decea&s;ed, that the admini&s;tration &s;hould be carried on by any one of the nominees rather than by the tutor-in-law. <Q REND="inline">"For were it other|wi&s;e, the more guardians are appointed for the &s;ecurity of the in|fant, the le&s;s &s;ecure he would be, becau&s;e upon the death of any one of them the guardian&s;hip would be at an end <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">New Abridg. of the law, vol. 2. p. 677.</NOTE>."</Q> Thus three tutors being named without &s;pecifying <HI>conjunctly</HI> or <HI>&s;everally,</HI> and one only having accepted, it was decreed, that the whole office was de|volved

<P>It is a very different ca&s;e, where it is declared, that a certain num|ber of the tutors named, termed a <HI>quorum,</HI> mu&s;t concur in every act: for if by death or non-acceptance the number be brought &s;o low as not to make a <HI>quorum,</HI> it follows from the declared will of the maker, that the tutors exi&s;ting cannot act; and therefore that the nomina|tion is void. It is po&s;&s;ible indeed, that the death or non-accept|ance of &s;o many as not to leave a <HI>quorum,</HI> may have been a <HI>ca&s;us incogitatus</HI> which the maker would have provided for had he fore|&s;een the event. But this is altogether conjectural: and &s;uppo|&s;ing it certain, yet here <HI>deficit voluntas;</HI> and in a deed which derives its obligatory force from will &s;olely, without any other cau&s;e, it is beyond the reach of equity to &s;upply the defect of will, which would land in making a will for a man who made none for him&s;elf. The &s;ame rea&s;oning is applicable to a nomination of tutors requiring expre&s;sly to every act the concurrence of one of them, termed a <HI>&s;ine quo non.</HI> And yet in &s;everal in&s;tances, &s;o much has the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion been inflamed with what have been reckon|ed equitable con&s;iderations, that neither the failing of a <HI>quorum,</HI> nor even of the <HI>&s;ine quo non,</HI> were deemed &s;ufficient to void the nomina|tion; for the court conjectured it to be the will of the decea&s;ed, to tru&s;t any of the per&s;ons named rather than the tutor-in-law <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, Dec. 22. 1692, Watt contra Scrimzeour. Fountainhall, Feb. 22. 1693. Counte&s;s of Callender contra Earl of Linlithgow.</NOTE>. But this &s;tretch of equity was afterward corrected in the following ca&s;e. In a nomination of tutors by a man to his children, his wife was named for one, and was &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed as to be declared <HI>&s;ine qua non.</HI> But &s;he by a &s;econd marriage having rendered her&s;elf in|capable of the office, the que&s;tion occurred, Whether this incident did not void the nomination altogether? And the court declared the no|mination void <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, June 24. 1703, Aikenhead contra Durham.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But though with re&s;pect to a <HI>quorum,</HI> or a <HI>&s;ine quo non,</HI> the defect of will cannot be &s;upplied, it is undoubtedly the privilege of a court of equity to &s;upply any defect in words, in order to make the will effectual. Of this take the following curious in&s;tance. A gentleman
<PB N="339" REF="348">
having named his &s;pou&s;e, his brother, and &s;everal others, to be tu|tors and curators to his only child, <Q REND="inline">"appointed, that of tho&s;e who &s;hould accept, and &s;urvive, the major part &s;hould be a <HI>quorum;</HI> that his &s;pou&s;e &s;hould be <HI>&s;ine qua non;</HI> and in ca&s;e of her death or incapacity, his brother; but that by the death or incapacity of ei|ther, the tutory and curatory &s;hould not be di&s;&s;olved, but be con|tinued with the other per&s;ons named, as long as any one of them remained alive."</Q> The only event omitted to be provided for was that which happened, <HI>viz.</HI> the widow's refu&s;al to undertake the of|fice, which brought on the que&s;tion before the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, Whe|ther the nomination could notwith&s;tanding &s;ub&s;i&s;t; or, Whether it was void to make way for the tutor-in-law. The court unanimou&s;ly held it undoubted law, the above mentioned deci&s;ions notwith&s;tanding, that the failure of any one of a plurality of tutors named jointly un|hinges the nomination, and &s;till more the failure of that per&s;on who is named <HI>&s;ine quo non,</HI> or the failure of a <HI>quorum:</HI> but, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, that it appeared the intention of the father to continue his no|mination as long as any of the per&s;ons named &s;hould exi&s;t; that this is expre&s;&s;ed in clear terms with re&s;pect to the death or incapacity of the <HI>&s;ine quibus non;</HI> and that the &s;ame mu&s;t be under&s;tood his will in the ca&s;e of their non-acceptance, becau&s;e the ca&s;es are &s;o parallel, as that no man could think of making a difference; and con&s;equently that here there is no defect of will, but of words only, occa&s;ioned by the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s or inaccuracy of the writer.

<P>I proceed to examples of a different kind. A man having left 2500 merks to his children, impowered four friends named to divide the &s;ame among the children.

<P>Helen Cuningham left 4000 merks to her grandchildren, to be employed for their behoof at the &s;ight of five per&s;ons named, of which number their father and mother were two. This &s;um was lent

out with the approbation of all, including the father and mother, one of the nominees excepted, who was abroad at the time. The ultimate purpo&s;e of this &s;ettlement was evidently to &s;ecure the grandchildren in the &s;um &s;ettled upon them; and if this was done by lending the money to a per&s;on of unexceptionable credit at the time, the granter's will and purpo&s;e was fulfilled. By naming &s;o many per&s;ons, he made it ea&s;y for the executor to get the approbation of a &s;ufficient number; and it could not be his intention to require rigidly the concur|rence of every per&s;on named. And yet the court, adhering to the words as a court of common law, found that the money was not em|ploy'd as it ought to have been, and therefore decreed the executor to be liable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spoti&s;woode, (Legacy), Feb. 13. 1624, Hunters contra Executors of Macmichael.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the power which officers of the law have to act <HI>ex|tra territorium.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A COURT of equity not only varies from common law in order to fulfil the great principles of ju&s;tice and utility, but countenan|ces &s;uch variations in the conduct of individuals. The pre&s;ent chap|ter is intended as an illu&s;tration of this doctrine; for &s;everal ex|amples will be given, of &s;upporting po&s;itive infringements of com|mon law done even by its own officers.</P>
<P>The legal authority of magi&s;trates and officers of the law being
<PB N="341" REF="350">
territorial, is confined within preci&s;e limits. In &s;trict rea&s;oning, no|thing can be pronounced with greater certainty, than that an officer of the law acting beyond the bounds of his commi&s;&s;ion, acts with|out authority: and yet in practice we admit &s;everal exceptions from this rule. If goods once apprehended in order to be poinded, be drove out of the &s;heriffdom purpo&s;ely to di&s;appoint the poinding, it is lawful for the officer to follow and complete his poinding, in the &s;ame manner as if the goods had not been drove away <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Balfour, (Poinding), March 22. 1560, Home contra Sheill.</NOTE>.

<P>Sir Matthew Hale, in his hi&s;tory of the pleas of the crown <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Vol. 2. p. 115.</NOTE>, handles this matter with care, and traces it through various ca&s;es. <Q REND="inline">"If a warrant or precept to arre&s;t a felon come to an officer or o|ther, if the felon be arre&s;ted, and after arre&s;t e&s;cape into another county, yet he may be pur&s;ued and taken upon fre&s;h pur&s;uit, and brought before the ju&s;tice of the county where the warrant i&s;|&s;ued; for the law adjudged him always in the officer's cu&s;tody by virtue of the fir&s;t arre&s;t. But if he e&s;cape before arre&s;t into another county, if it be a warrant barely for a mi&s;demeanour, it &s;eems the officer cannot pur&s;ue him into another county; becau&s;e out of the juri&s;diction of the ju&s;tice who granted the warrant. But in ca&s;e of felony, affray, or dangerous wounding, the officer may pur&s;ue him, and u&s;e hue and cry upon him into any county. But if he take him in a foreign county, he is to bring him to the gaol or ju&s;tice of that county where he is taken. For he doth not take him pure|ly by the warrant of the ju&s;tice, but by the authority that the law gives him; and the ju&s;tice's warrant is a &s;ufficient cau&s;e of
<PB N="342" REF="351">
&s;u&s;picion and pur&s;uit."</Q> Here &s;everal ca&s;es are di&s;tingui&s;hed, and different degrees of power indulged to the officer, all of them flatly contradictory to the &s;trict rules of common law: and yet we chear|fully acquie&s;ce in the doctrine, becau&s;e our hearts dictate to us that it is ju&s;t and &s;alutary.</P>
<P>Let us examine what will the mo&s;t readily occur in reflecting upon this &s;ubject. If a felon be once arre&s;ted and in the hands of the officer, a notion of property ari&s;es, and &s;ugge&s;ts a right &s;imilar to that of the fir&s;t occupant of land. Though the felon e&s;cape, the officer, in fre&s;h pur&s;uit, is under&s;tood to retain a &s;ort of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion <HI>animo,</HI> intitling him to pur&s;ue the felon till he compa&s;s his aim, <HI>viz.</HI> a &s;econd arre&s;t. We naturally conclude, that the felon, being in &s;ome &s;en&s;e the property of the officer, may be &s;eized where-ever he can be found; and, by virtue of that <HI>qua&s;i</HI> property, may be carried be|fore the judge who granted the warrant. This rea&s;oning will appear &s;till more &s;atisfactory when it is applied to the ca&s;e cited above from Balfour, where a poinding is inchoated by apprehen&s;ion of the goods; a circum&s;tance which undoubtedly produces &s;ome faint no|tion of property in the goods, intitling the poinder to &s;eize them where-ever found.</P>
<P>Again, <Q REND="inline">"where a felon e&s;capes without being arre&s;ted, if the war|rant be barely for a mi&s;demeanour, it &s;eems the officer cannot pur&s;ue him into another county. But in ca&s;e of felony, affray, or dangerous wounding, the officer may pur&s;ue him into another county."</Q> Here is a di&s;tinction made which appears to have a foundation in human nature. As this di&s;tinction cannot ari&s;e from the nature of the warrant, which is not more exten&s;ive in the one ca&s;e than in the other, it mu&s;t ari&s;e from the nature of the delin|quency. Felony, or any capital crime, inflames the mind, and creates a &s;trong de&s;ire of puni&s;hment: the heated imagination is hur|ried along, and cannot be re&s;trained by the &s;light fetters of &s;trict form. And accordingly, in weighing an ab&s;tract principle again&s;t the impul&s;e of an hone&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, the mind, which feels the prepon|derancy of the latter, naturally embraces the following &s;entiment, That the officer in this ca&s;e ought not to be confined within the li|mits of his commi&s;&s;ion. In the ca&s;e of a &s;light mi&s;demeanour, the re&s;ult is different. Strict principles have a &s;tronger effect upon the mind than any impul&s;e that can ari&s;e from a venial tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and therefore, in judging of this ca&s;e, the mind naturally re&s;ts up|on the limitation of the warrant.</P>
<P>And what is further mentioned in the foregoing quotation, will
<PB N="343" REF="352">
&s;upport the&s;e reflections. <Q REND="inline">"A delinquent once arre&s;ted, may, upon a &s;econd arre&s;t, be brought from another county to the judge who gave the warrant. But if arre&s;ted for the fir&s;t time in a foreign county, the criminal mu&s;t be carried before the judge of the county where he is taken."</Q> The di&s;tinction here made, ari&s;es from the &s;ame principles that are above explained. It has already been ob&s;erved, that the notion of a <HI>qua&s;i</HI> property &s;upplies the want of a &s;econd warrant. But an arre&s;t for the fir&s;t time in a foreign county mu&s;t be governed by a different rule: the mind figuring a hot pur&s;uit of the criminal, ea&s;ily &s;urmounts any ob&s;truction that may ari&s;e from mere form; but &s;o &s;oon as the end is gained by ha|ving the felon in &s;afe cu&s;tody, the impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion being over, the mind &s;ub&s;ides; and in this condition, perceiving the defect of power, it takes the fir&s;t opportunity of &s;upplying the defect, by an application to the judge of the place <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This form is now rendered unnece&s;&s;ary by act 24^o Geo.

<P>And with re&s;pect to the two ca&s;es now mentioned, a remarkable difference is ob&s;ervable in the operations of the mind. However &s;trong the impul&s;e of a pa&s;&s;ion may be when it agitates the mind, yet as &s;oon as it &s;ub&s;ides by gratification, the mind is left free to the government of rea&s;on. Thus when a felon who was never arre&s;t|ed is pur&s;ued into a foreign county, the defect of power is &s;carce perceived during the heat of pur&s;uit: but immediately upon the ar|re&s;t, the defect of power makes an impre&s;&s;ion; and rea&s;on demands that the defect be forthwith &s;upplied. The mind is differently influ|enced in the ca&s;e of an e&s;cape after arre&s;t. If once a re&s;emblance be di&s;covered between two objects, there is a natural propen&s;ity to make the re&s;emblance as complete as po&s;&s;ible; which in rea&s;oning produ|ces an error extremely common, <HI>viz.</HI> that of drawing the &s;ame in|ferences as if the re&s;emblance were altogether complete. Thus by getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the body of a felon, a faint notion of property being &s;ugge&s;ted, the mind proceeds, without he&s;itation, to form all its conclu&s;ions as if the felon were truly the property of the of|ficer.</P>
<P>It is extremely curious to ob&s;erve, how men &s;ometimes are influen|ced by principles and emotions that they them&s;elves at the time &s;carce attend to; which is remarkable in writers upon law, who, little apt to regard the &s;ilent operations of the mind, are not &s;ati&s;|fied
<PB N="344" REF="353">
unle&s;s for every regulation they can a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on in &s;trict law. This proceeds from &s;tudying law too much as an ab&s;tract &s;ci|ence, without con&s;idering, that all its regulations ought to be founded upon human nature, and be adapted to the various opera|tions of the mind. If one of the greate&s;t lawyers in modern times furni&s;h this cen&s;ure, few can hope to e&s;cape. And that the cen&s;ure is ju&s;t, will appear from con&s;idering the rea&s;oning of our author, which is by no means &s;atisfactory. With regard to the felon who has been once arre&s;ted, he a&s;&s;igns the following rea&s;on for the regu|lation, <Q REND="inline">"That the law adjudgeth him always in the officer's cu&s;tody by virtue of the fir&s;t arre&s;t."</Q> But why does the law give this judgment, when it is contrary to the fact? This que&s;tion ought to have been prevented in accurate rea&s;oning: in&s;tead of which we are left in the dark, preci&s;ely where light is the mo&s;t wanted. The true an&s;wer to this que&s;tion is given above, <HI>viz.</HI> that the right of po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion once fairly acquired, cannot be lo&s;t by &s;tealth or force, and therefore is retained <HI>animo.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the other branch, the rea&s;oning appears &s;till more lame. The ca&s;e is of a felon apprehended for the fir&s;t time out of the ju|ri&s;diction; upon which our author's rea&s;oning is, <Q REND="inline">"That the officer doth not act purely by the warrant of the ju&s;tice, but by the au|thority which the law gives him; and that the ju&s;tice's warrant is a &s;ufficient cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion and pur&s;uit."</Q> This is extremely ob&s;cure, and un&s;atisfactory &s;o far as intelligible. In the fir&s;t place, it is obvious, that the rea&s;oning, if ju&s;t, is equally applicable what|ever be the nature of the crime: the ju&s;tice's warrant is not more a &s;ufficient cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion and pur&s;uit where the crime is atrocious, than where it is of the &s;lighte&s;t kind. In the next place, &s;uppo&s;ing the ju&s;tice's warrant to be a &s;ufficient cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion, and con&s;e|quently of pur&s;uit, the per&s;on upon who&s;e information the warrant was i&s;&s;ued has a better cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion, and yet the law impowers not that per&s;on to apprehend nor to pur&s;ue. Neither doth a &s;uffi|cient cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion give authority to an officer of the law out of the juri&s;diction, more than to a private per&s;on. But let a man having authority to apprehend be figured in hot pur&s;uit of a noted criminal, the mind forthwith interpo&s;es, and hurries him on till he reach his quarry where-ever found: no &s;uch impre&s;&s;ion is made by the &s;lighter tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. And this difference of feeling, is the founda|tion of our author's doctrine; a difference that undoubtedly he was &s;en&s;ible of, though he has not been &s;o lucky as to put it in a clear light.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="354">
Thus we have endeavoured to trace out the foundation of &s;everal nice conclu&s;ions in law, that depend not on ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, but on &s;entiment. In one of the ca&s;es, an imagined right over the per|&s;on of a felon arre&s;ted, &s;ugge&s;ted by a &s;light re&s;emblance it hath to property, is in reality the only foundation of our conclu|&s;ion. In the other, what in reality determines us, is the anxiety we have to prevent the felon's e&s;cape. And whoever examines laws and deci&s;ions with due attention, will find many of them found|ed on impre&s;&s;ions or emotions, &s;till more &s;light than tho&s;e above mentioned.</P>
<P>To complete the &s;ubject, nothing further &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary but to ob&s;erve, that the foregoing principles and operations of the mind, are countenanced by courts of ju&s;tice, even &s;o far as upon their account to di&s;pen&s;e with the cleare&s;t rules of law. The&s;e principles and operations merit regard as virtuous and laudable; but their merit chiefly depends on their utility. By overcoming that &s;cru|pulous nicety of law, which often is an impediment to the admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice, they tend in an eminent degree to the good of &s;ociety.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Juri&s;diction of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion with re&s;pect to foreign matters.</HEAD>
<P>THE various &s;ubjects hitherto treated, falling within the bounds of common law, come of cour&s;e under the equitable juri&s;dic|tion of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;upplying defects or correcting inju|&s;tice in common law. Foreign matters, as will by and by be ex|plained, fall not within the bounds of common law, and for that rea&s;on cannot come under the juri&s;diction of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, either as a court of common law or as a court of equity. Why then &s;hould the pre&s;ent &s;ubject be brought into a treati&s;e of equity? Not nece&s;&s;arily, I acknowledge. It is, however, &s;o intimately connected with matters of equity, that the &s;e&s;&s;ion, acting whether as a court for foreign af|fairs or as a court of equity, is governed by the &s;ame principles, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e above laid down. Of the&s;e accordingly we &s;hall &s;ee many beautiful illu&s;trations in handling the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, which, in that view, will make a proper appendix to a treati&s;e on equity, if not a ne|ce&s;&s;ary part.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="355">
Men, allured by hu&s;bandry, having relinqui&s;hed the wandering &s;tate for a &s;ettled habitation, were by this revolution brought under new rules of law. The laws of a tribe or clan, governed originally each individual belonging to it, without relation to place <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 6.</NOTE>. But after na|tions became &s;tationary, place became the capital circum&s;tance. Laws were made to regulate all matters at home, that is, within the territo|ry of the &s;tate; and legi&s;lators extended not their view to what was done or &s;uffered in a foreign country, whether by their own people or by &s;trangers. Thus laws, originally <HI>per&s;onal,</HI> became &s;trictly <HI>ter|ritorial;</HI> and hence the e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, That law hath no autho|rity <HI>extra territorium.</HI> This confined notion of law corre&s;ponded per|fectly well to the manners of early times: mutual fear and diffidence, in days of barbarity, prevented all intercour&s;e among nations; and individuals, having no temptation to go abroad, &s;eldom ventured be|yond their own territory. But regular government introduced more &s;ocial manners; the appetite for riches unfolded it&s;elf, and individuals were put in motion to &s;eek gain where the pro&s;pect was faire&s;t: in mo&s;t countries accordingly, there are found many foreigners, who have an occa&s;ional re&s;idence there for the &s;ake of commerce. This change of manners di&s;covered the imperfection of territorial laws: a man, by retiring abroad, is &s;ecure again&s;t a pro&s;ecution, civil or criminal, for what he has done at home; and by returning home, he is &s;ecure a|gain&s;t a pro&s;ecution for what he has done abroad: common law reach|eth no per&s;on but who is actually within the territory of the &s;tate; and reacheth no cau&s;e of action but what happens within the &s;ame territory <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The common law of England is &s;trictly territorial in the &s;en&s;e above de&s;cribed <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Statute law of Scotland abridged, note 7.</NOTE>: nor have we rea&s;on to believe that the com|mon law of Scotland was more exten&s;ive. When therefore the fore|going defect came to be di&s;covered, it was nece&s;&s;ary to provide a remedy; and the remedy was, to bring foreign matters under juri&s;diction of the King and council; to which originally, as a pa|ramount court, all extraordinary matters were appropriated. In Scotland particularly, the act 105. parl. 1487, declares the King and council to be the only court for <HI>the actions of &s;trangers of other realms.</HI></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to foreign matters, the juri&s;diction of the King and council in both kingdoms, was di&s;tingui&s;hed from that of the ordi|nary
<PB N="347" REF="356">
courts of law in two particulars. Fir&s;t, The juri&s;diction of the latter was territorial with re&s;pect to cau&s;es as well as with re&s;pect to per&s;ons: the juri&s;diction of the former was indeed territorial with re&s;pect to per&s;ons, no per&s;on in foreign parts being &s;ubjected to the juri&s;diction; but with re&s;pect to cau&s;es, it was the oppo&s;ite to ter|ritorial, no cau&s;e but what happened in foreign parts being com|petent. Next, the ordinary courts are confined to common law: but with re&s;pect to foreign matters this law can be no rule, for the rea&s;on above given, that it regulates nothing <HI>extra territorium.</HI> The King and council accordingly judging of foreign matters, could not be governed by the common law of any country: the com|mon law of <HI>Britain</HI> regulates not foreign matters; and the law of a foreign country hath no authority here. Whence it follows, that foreign matters mu&s;t be governed by the rules of common ju|&s;tice, to which all men are &s;ubjected, or <HI>jure gentium,</HI> as generally ex|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This extraordinary juri&s;diction concerning foreign matters, confi|ned originally in both kingdoms to the &s;ame court, is now exerci&s;ed very differently in the two kingdoms. In Scotland, it was derived by intermediate &s;teps from the King and council to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion: and accordingly, by the regulations laid down &s;oon after the in&s;titution of that court, a juri&s;diction is be&s;tow'd upon it as to foreign matters, and the actions of foreigners are privileged <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 45. parl. 1537.</NOTE>. In England, this extraordinary juri&s;diction made a different progre&s;s. The exten&s;ive territories po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h Kings in France, and the great re&s;ort of Engli&s;hmen there, occa&s;ioned numberle&s;s law|&s;uits before the King and council. To relieve that court from an oppre&s;&s;ive load of bu&s;ine&s;s, the con&s;table and mar&s;hal court was in|&s;tituted; and to this new court were appropriated foreign matters, to be tried <HI>jure gentium</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Duck de authoritate juris Civilis, lib. 2. cap. 8. part 3. &sect; 15. &amp;c.</NOTE>. After the Engli&s;h conque&s;ts in France were wre&s;ted from them, this court had very little bu&s;ine&s;s. We find &s;cattered in&s;tances of its acting as a criminal court, down to the reign of Charles II.; but none for centuries before of its acting as a civil court. The court of chancery, with re&s;pect to its power of &s;upplying the defects and mitigating the rigor of common law, had &s;ucceeded to the King and council; and it would have been a na|tural mea&s;ure to transfer to the &s;ame court the extraordinary juri&s;|diction under con&s;ideration, the rule of judging being the &s;ame in
<PB N="348" REF="357">
both. But the court of chancery being at that time in its infancy, and its privilege as to all extraordinary matters not being clearly un|folded, the courts of common law, by an artifice or fiction, a&s;&s;umed foreign matters to them&s;elves. The cau&s;e of action is feigned to have exi&s;ted in England <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Duck de authoritate juris Civilis, lib. 2. cap. 8. part 3. &sect; 18.</NOTE>, and the defendant is not &s;uffered to traver&s;e this allegation. This may be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as an u&s;urpation of the courts of common law upon the court of chancery, which, like mo&s;t u&s;urpations, has occa&s;ioned very irregular con&s;equences. I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;trange irregularity of a&s;&s;uming a juri&s;diction upon no better foundation than an ab&s;olute fal&s;ehood. It is more material to ob&s;erve, that foreign matters ought to be tried <HI>june gentium,</HI> and yet that the judges who u&s;urp this juri&s;diction have no power to try any cau&s;e otherwi&s;e than by the common law of England. What can be expected from &s;uch incon&s;i&s;tency but inju&s;tice in every in&s;tance? Lucky it is for Scotland, that chance, perhaps more than good policy, hath appropriated foreign matters to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, where they can be decided on rational principles, without being ab&s;urdly fettered, as in England, by common law.</P>
<P>To form a di&s;tinct notion of the foregoing extraordinary juri&s;|diction of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion with re&s;pect to foreign matters, it may be proper to &s;tate &s;uccinctly its different juri&s;dictions, and to a&s;cer|tain the bounds of each. Con&s;idered as a court of common law, tho&s;e actions only belong to it where the cau&s;e of action did ari&s;e within Scotland. With regard to per&s;ons, this court was originally limited like the courts of common law in England: it had no au|thority over any man but during the time he was locally in Scotland. But in this re&s;pect the court hath in later times acquired, by pre|&s;cription, an enlargement of juri&s;diction: every Scotchman, even in foreign parts, is &s;ubjected to the juri&s;diction of the court; and, by a citation at the market-cro&s;s of Edinburgh, pier and &s;hore of Leith, may be called to defend in any action before the court <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Statute-law of Scotland abridged, note 7.</NOTE>. In the next place, con&s;idering this court as a court of equity, impowered to &s;upply the defects and mitigate the rigor of common law, its juri&s;|diction is and mu&s;t be the &s;ame with what it enjoys as a court of common law. To give it a more exten&s;ive juri&s;diction would be u&s;ele&s;s; and to confine it within narrower bounds would not fully an&s;wer the end of its in&s;titution, which is to redre&s;s common law when ju&s;tice demands redre&s;s. In the la&s;t place, this court, with re|lation
<PB N="349" REF="358">
to foreign matters, has the &s;ame juri&s;diction over per&s;ons that it has as a court of common law or of equity. And accordingly the court had no difficulty to &s;u&s;tain a proce&s;s for payment of an ac|count contracted at Campvere in Zealand, though the defendant, a Scotch merchant re&s;iding there, was not in this country any time du|ring the &s;uit <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">June 27. 1760, Hog contra Tennent.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The rules that govern the &s;e&s;&s;ion as a court for foreign matters, are the &s;ame that govern it as a court of equity; for the&s;e rules are derived from the principles of ju&s;tice. But it mu&s;t not be held that the&s;e rules are applied preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner: as a court of equity, the &s;e&s;&s;ion will not venture to interpo&s;e again&s;t common law, unle&s;s authori&s;ed by &s;ome general rule of equity that is applicable to all ca&s;es of the kind; but as to foreign matters, which belong not to common law, every ca&s;e mu&s;t be judged upon its own merits. And therefore the court here is le&s;s under re&s;traint, than in &s;upplying the defects of common law, or in correcting its rigor.</P>
<P>Though with re&s;pect to foreign matters, there is, &s;trictly &s;peak|ing, but one rule for judging, <HI>viz.</HI> equity, or natural ju&s;tice; yet this rule, in its application to different matters, brings out very dif|ferent conclu&s;ions. And &s;hould one undertake to unfold all the va|rious ca&s;es to which the rule may be applied, the work would be endle&s;s. Avoiding therefore this laborious ta&s;k, I propo&s;e to con|fine my &s;peculations to &s;ome few leading ca&s;es that have been di&s;|puted in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion; and the&s;e, for the &s;ake of per&s;picuity, &s;hall be di&s;tributed into &s;everal cla&s;&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I. Actions &s;trictly per&s;onal founded on foreign covenants, deeds, or facts.</HEAD>
<P>UPon the principles above laid down there can be no doubt, that a foreign covenant will produce an action here, provided the party bound by the covenant, whether a native or a foreigner, be found in Scotland. It would be a great defect in law, were there no redre&s;s again&s;t a foreigner who retires with his effects to this coun|try, in order to &s;creen him&s;elf from debts contracted at home. And yet the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion refu&s;ed to &s;u&s;tain an action brought by one foreigner again&s;t another for payment of debt contracted abroad; giving for a rea&s;on, that the parties were here occa&s;ionally only,
<PB N="350" REF="359">
and that the debtor having no domicil in Scotland, was not &s;ubjected to the juri&s;diction of this court<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haddington, Nov. 23. 1610. Vernor con|tra Elvies.</NOTE> This was in effect declaring, that the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion is a court of common law only, having no pri|vilege to cogno&s;ce of foreign tran&s;actions; a &s;trange mi&s;take, con&s;i|dering the regulation above mentioned, acknowledging a juri&s;diction in this court as to foreign matters.</P>
<P>When a foreign bond &s;tipulating the intere&s;t of the country where granted, is made the foundation of a proce&s;s here, it has been doubt|ed, whether that intere&s;t or the legal intere&s;t of this country ought to be decreed. This doubt is ea&s;ily &s;olved. An agreement to pay the intere&s;t of the country where the money is borrowed, is undoubt|edly binding in con&s;cience, and therefore ought to be made effectual in every country. Nor do we meet with any ob&s;truction in the Scotch &s;tatutes regulating the intere&s;t of money, which are not in|tended to reach foreign intere&s;t. And this accordingly is the rule in the law of England <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Abridg. ca&s;es in equity, ch. 36. &s;ect. E. &sect; 1.</NOTE>. Hence it appears, that the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion erred in refu&s;ing the intere&s;t of 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> upon a double bond exe|cuted in Ireland, and in re&s;tricting the penal part of the bond to 6 <HI>per cent.</HI> the legal intere&s;t here <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, Jan. 27. 1710, Savage con|tra Craig.</NOTE>. This error will be not le&s;s evident from another con&s;ideration. The penalty of a double bond put in &s;uit here, ought to be &s;u&s;tained to the extent of damage and co&s;ts of &s;uit: but the damage is plainly the intere&s;t of the country where the mo|ney is lent; becau&s;e had payment been duly made, the money again lent out would have produced that intere&s;t. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, &s;up|po&s;ing the rate of intere&s;t to be lower in England than here, our judges, in relieving from the penalty in a double bond, will make the Engli&s;h intere&s;t the rule; for the lender could not have a view to greater intere&s;t than that of his own country.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is different where intere&s;t is &s;tipulated greater than is permitted in the <HI>locus contractus.</HI> Such &s;tipulation is u&s;ury in that country, and a moral wrong every where: I &s;ay a moral wrong, be|cau&s;e, as every man is bound to give obedience to the laws of his own country, it is a moral wrong to tran&s;gre&s;s the&s;e laws <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See p. 179.</NOTE>. When action therefore is brought in a foreign country for payment of the &s;tipulated intere&s;t, it would be contrary to the rules of ju&s;tice to &s;u&s;tain a claim that is founded on an immoral paction; and the judge
<PB N="351" REF="360">
who &s;hould &s;u&s;tain action in that ca&s;e would be acce&s;&s;ory to the wrong. But now, admitting that the intere&s;t &s;tipulated ought not to be &s;u&s;tain|ed, it comes next to be con&s;idered, whether the intere&s;t of the <HI>locus contractus</HI> &s;hould be the rule, or that of the country where the action is brought, or la&s;tly, whether intere&s;t &s;hould be rejected altogether. This is a puzzling que&s;tion. One at fir&s;t view will naturally reject intere&s;t altogether, as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment of the wrong done. But it is not clear that a judge can puni&s;h for a wrong committed in a foreign country. One thing indeed is clear, that action cannot be &s;u&s;tained upon the immoral &s;tipulation; and therefore, if there be any claim for intere&s;t, it mu&s;t be <HI>nomine damni</HI> only. This leads the mind to the intere&s;t of the <HI>locus contractus;</HI> and I incline to be of opinion that that intere&s;t is due.</P>
<P>Under the head of covenants comes properly marriage celebrated abroad. The municipal law of Scotland, regulating the &s;olemnities of marriage, re&s;pects no marriage but what is made in Scotland: and as foreign laws have no coercive authority here, nothing is left for determining the validity of &s;uch a marriage but the law of na|ture. According to that law the matrimonial connection is founded upon con&s;ent &s;olely; and the various &s;olemnities required by the laws of different nations have all of them the &s;ame aim, <HI>viz.</HI> to te|&s;tify con&s;ent in the mo&s;t complete manner. In this view, the &s;o|lemnities of the country where a marriage is celebrated, ought with us to have the greate&s;t weight; becau&s;e they evidently &s;how the de|liberate will and purpo&s;e of the parties. On the other hand, ju&s;tice requires that a marriage be held good here, though not formal ac|cording to the law of the country where it was made, provided the will and purpo&s;e of the parties to unite in marriage clearly appear.</P>
<P>According to the doctrine here laid down, a child ought with us to be held legitimate by a &s;ub&s;equent marriage, provided the mar|riage-ceremony was performed in a country where &s;uch is the law; becau&s;e marriage in &s;uch a country mu&s;t import the will of the fa|ther to legitimate his ba&s;tard children. But we cannot ju&s;tly give the &s;ame effect to a marriage celebrated in a country where the mar|riage, as in England, hath not the effect of legitimation. The rea|&s;on is, that marriage in &s;uch a ca&s;e is not a proof of the father's will to legitimate.</P>
<P>A minor in the choice he makes of curators is not confined to the inhabitants of his own country; and therefore a foreigner cho&s;en curator has the &s;ame authority here with a native. Neither is it
<PB N="352" REF="361">
of importance in what place curators be cho&s;en; and accordingly a choice made in England of curators, whether Engli&s;h or Scotch, will be effectual here. The powers of a guardian to a lunatic in England are more limited. The cu&s;tody of the per&s;on of an Engli&s;h lunatic and the management of his land-e&s;tate in England belong to the court of chancery; and the chancellor names one guardian to the per&s;on, another to the e&s;tate. But the chancellor having no power over a lunatic's land in Scotland, cannot appoint a guardian to manage &s;uch land.</P>
<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed civil matters, I proceed to criminal. A crime committed at &s;ea may be tried by the court of admiralty: but, this ca&s;e excepted, no crime committed in a foreign country can be tried in Scotland. The juri&s;diction of the ju&s;ticiary-court is &s;trictly terri|torial, being confined within the limits of Scotland; and the extra|ordinary juri&s;diction of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion with re&s;pect to foreign matters, reaches civil cau&s;es only. Nor is it nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be extended to crimes. It is of great importance to every nation that ju&s;tice have a free cour&s;e every where; and to this end it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary that in every country there be an extraordinary juri&s;diction for foreign matters, as far as ju&s;tice is concerned. But there is not the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity for an extraordinary juri&s;diction to puni&s;h foreign delinquencies: the proper place for puni&s;hment is where the crime is committed; and no &s;ociety takes concern in any crime but what is hurtful to it&s;elf. A claim for reparation ari&s;ing from a foreign delinquency, &s;tands upon a different footing: being founded on the rules of common ju&s;tice, it is a claim that undoubtedly belongs to the juri&s;diction under con&s;ideration. No man who injures another ought to reckon him&s;elf &s;ecure any where till he make reparation; and if he be ob&s;tinate or refractory, ju&s;tice requires that he be compelled, where-ever found, to make reparation.</P>
<P>To &s;ecure the effects of the decea&s;ed from embezzlement, every per|&s;on who intermeddles irregularly is, in Scotland, &s;ubjected to the whole debts of the decea&s;ed, without limitation. This penal pa&s;&s;ive title, termed <HI>vicious intromi&s;&s;ion,</HI> is confined to irregular intermeddling within Scotland. The intermeddling in England with the moveable effects of a Scotchman who dies there, mu&s;t be judged by the rules of natural ju&s;tice; and therefore in this country cannot infer any conclu&s;ion beyond re&s;titution or damages.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Foreign covenants and deeds re&s;pecting land.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to have a di&s;tinct conception of this branch, the extent of our own municipal law with re&s;pect to land in Scotland mu&s;t be a&s;certained; for we are not at liberty to apply the <HI>jus gentium,</HI> or the principles of natural ju&s;tice, to any ca&s;e that comes under our own law. As to this preliminary point, things it is certain as well as per&s;ons are governed by municipal law, and &s;ubjected to the juri&s;|diction of courts of law. Land in particular, next to per&s;ons, is the greate&s;t object of law; and in every country the acqui&s;ition and tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of land are regulated by municipal law. Our law, for example, with re&s;pect to the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of land-property, requires writings in a peculiar form. Such writings are held a good title of property, whether executed at home or abroad. Writings, on the o|ther hand, in a form different from that pre&s;cribed by our law, will be di&s;regarded where-ever executed; for our law regards the &s;olemni|ties only, not the place. Thus a te&s;tament made in England, be|queathing land in Scotland, is not &s;u&s;tained by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e, by our law, no man can di&s;po&s;e of his land by te&s;tament: nor will it be regarded that land is te&s;table in England; becau&s;e every thing concerning land in Scotland is regulated by our law. In general, the connection of a land-e&s;tate with the territory where &s;ituated, is of the mo&s;t intimate kind: it bears the relation of a part to the whole. Thus every legal act concerning land, the conveying it <HI>inter vivos,</HI> the tran&s;mitting it from the dead to the living, the &s;e|curity granted on it for debt, are a&s;certained by the municipal law of every country; and with re&s;pect to every particular of that kind, our courts are tied down to their own law.</P>
<P>Are we then to hold, that a conveyance of land in a form differ|ent from what is required by us can have no effect? Suppo&s;e a man &s;ells in England his land-e&s;tate in Scotland, executes a deed of conveyance in the Engli&s;h form, and perhaps receives payment of the price: &s;uch conveyance, not being in the form required by the law of Scotland, will not have the effect to transfer the property. But has the purcha&s;er any claim in Scotland again&s;t the vender? None at common law; becau&s;e a court of common law hath not authori|ty to transform an actual di&s;po&s;ition into an obligation to di&s;pone.
<PB N="354" REF="363">
But &s;uch claim is &s;upported in equity; becau&s;e where a man, in or|der to transfer his land to a purcha&s;er, executes a di&s;po&s;ition which is afterward di&s;covered to be imperfect, it is his duty to execute one more formal; and if he be refractory, it is the duty of a court of e|quity to compel him, or to &s;upply his place. If the action be laid within the territory where the land is &s;ituated, the judge, in default of the di&s;poner, may adjudge the land to the plaintiff: if in any o|ther territory, all that can en&s;ue is damage for not performance. I illu&s;trate this doctrine by a &s;imilar ca&s;e. A di&s;po&s;ition of land with|in Scotland without procuratory or precept, will not be regarded at common law: but a court of equity, attentive to ju&s;tice, will inter|po&s;e in behalf of the purcha&s;er, by adjudging the land to him. Thus with re&s;pect to an informal conveyance of land within Scotland, the &s;e&s;&s;ion acts as a court of equity; and it acts as an extraordinary court for foreign matters where a conveyance is executed abroad ac|cording to the law of the place.</P>
<P>A covenant was executed in England between two brothers, agree|ing, that failing children the e&s;tate of the decea&s;ed &s;hould go to the &s;urvivor. The brother who fir&s;t decea&s;ed had a land-e&s;tate in Scot|land, a part of which he had gratuitou&s;ly aliened in defraud of the covenant. A reduction was brought of this gratuitous deed by the &s;urviving brother, and the covenant was &s;u&s;tained as a good title in the reduction. The covenant, though it had not the formalities of the law of Scotland, was however good evidence of the agreement between the brothers; and as the decea&s;ed brother had done a mo|ral wrong in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the agreement, ju&s;tice required that the wrong &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed, which was done by voiding the gratui|tous deed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes, July 5. 1706, Cuningham contra Lady Sempill.</NOTE>. But in a later ca&s;e, the court deviated widely from the foregoing principle of ju&s;tice. A di&s;po&s;ition of an heritable juri&s;dic|tion in Scotland, executed in England according to the Engli&s;h form, was not &s;u&s;tained even again&s;t the granter, to compel him to execute a more formal di&s;po&s;ition <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">February 1729, Earl Dalkeith contra Book.</NOTE>. This was acting as a court of common law. And it mu&s;t not pa&s;s unob&s;erved, that the accumu|lating different juri&s;dictions in the &s;ame court, occa&s;ions frequently mi&s;takes of this nature; which are avoided in countries where differ|ent juri&s;dictions are pre&s;erved di&s;tinct in different courts.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. Foreign covenants and deeds re&s;pecting moveables.</HEAD>
<P>MOveables as well as immoveables have a local &s;ituation; and it is a propo&s;ition acknowledged by all our lawyers, That Scotch moveables as well as Scotch land are regulated by our municipal law. Thus though an executor may be named by a nuncupative will in England, yet &s;uch will is never &s;u&s;tained to carry moveables in Scotland, becau&s;e writ with us is an e&s;&s;ential &s;olemnity in the no|mination of an executor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, Gilmour, Newbyth, January 19. 1665, Shaw contra Lewis.</NOTE>. In England again, a ba&s;tard enjoys the privilege of making a te&s;tament, which privilege is denied to a ba|&s;tard here. And therefore, notwith&s;tanding a te&s;tament made by a ba&s;tard in England, his effects here were e&s;cheated to the crown <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Haddington, February 1. 1611, Purves contra Chi&s;holm.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The application of the foregoing rule to land is abundantly ea&s;y, in Europe at lea&s;t, where the marches of different kingdoms and territories are a&s;certained with preci&s;ion. But the &s;light connection that moveables have with the place where they are found, makes it often a difficult problem to a&s;certain the country they belong to. And yet the &s;olution of this problem is nece&s;&s;ary with re&s;pect to ma|ny que&s;tions concerning them, &s;uch as the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the manner of tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the dead to the living, and from the living to the living. All que&s;tions of this kind are regulated by the law of the country to which the&s;e moveables properly belong; for it would be too precarious a rule, to con&s;ider them as belonging to the country where they happen to be, occa&s;ionally or accidentally: if a foreigner, for example, happen to die here with valuable move|ables about him, it will not be thought rea&s;onable that the&s;e move|ables &s;hould be given to tho&s;e who would be his next of kin accor|ding to the law of Scotland, when his next of kin according to the law of his own country are different, and when the&s;e next of kin will take the effects he left at home. The local &s;ituation of move|ables is attended with &s;uch variety of circum&s;tances that it is diffi|cult to bring all of them under general rules. It is nece&s;&s;ary howe|ver to make an attempt; and the following rules may, I pre&s;ume, exhau&s;t the bulk of the&s;e circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, moveables belonging to a Scotchman, and local|ly
<PB N="356" REF="365">
in Scotland, are deemed Scotch effects, to be regulated by the law of Scotland. Nor will it vary the ca&s;e that the proprietor happens to be occa&s;ionally abroad <HI>non animo remanendi:</HI> an a&s;&s;ignment made by him there according to the <HI>lex loci,</HI> will not transfer the&s;e move|ables to the a&s;&s;ignee. But according to what is &s;aid above with re|&s;pect to land, it will intitle the a&s;&s;ignee to demand from the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion that the moveables be adjudged to him; or to demand da|mages, unle&s;s the cedent be willing to grant a more formal a&s;&s;ign|ment. Next, if the proprietor happen to die abroad, his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion will be regulated by the law of Scotland, as al&s;o the form of making up titles. The connection with his own country continues entire in the mind of every per&s;on, and all matters are determined in the &s;ame manner as if he had died at home. That this is the common &s;en&s;e of mankind is te&s;tified by good authority, <HI>viz.</HI> act 88. parl. 1426, injoining, <Q REND="inline">"That where a Scotchman dies abroad occa&s;ionally, <HI>non animo remanendi,</HI> his Scotch effects mu&s;t be confirmed in Scot|land."</Q></P>
<P>Moveables, on the other hand, occa&s;ionally in Scotland, belonging to a foreigner, are held to be foreign effects, not regulated by the law of this country: the occa&s;ional connection with this country, yields to the more intimate connection with the proprietor, who is a foreigner. For this rea&s;on, a foreign a&s;&s;ignment of &s;uch moveables, formal according to the <HI>lex loci,</HI> will be &s;u&s;tained by the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion acting as judges in foreign matters. And, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, an executor named by the proprietor will have a good claim to &s;uch moveables, provided he complete his title <HI>&s;ecundum con&s;uetudinem loci.</HI> And even though the proprietor, here occa&s;ionally, fall &s;ick and die, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion will prefer tho&s;e who are next of kin according to the law of his country; and if he be an Engli&s;hman, for ex|ample, will &s;u&s;tain letters of admini&s;tration from the prerogative|court as the proper title. In like manner, if a Scotchman occa&s;ional|ly in England die there, the moveables he carried with him ought to be held Scotch moveables, to be regulated by the law of Scotland: and the Engli&s;h judges, were they permitted to decide <HI>&s;ecundum bonum et aequum,</HI> without being fettered by their own municipal law, would certainly be of the &s;ame opinion. This article demands peculiar at|tention: here is a &s;ituation of things not a little &s;ingular, a &s;ituation that obliges our judges to follow, not their own law, not the <HI>jus gentium,</HI> but the municipal law of another country.</P>
<P>In the third place, a purcha&s;e of Scotch moveables made by a fo|reigner, doth not change the legal country of the&s;e moveables, if I
<PB N="357" REF="366">
may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion. An a&s;&s;ignment by the foreigner in the form of his own country, will not be a good title of property; nor will the foreign method of conveying effects from the dead to the living be held &s;ufficient. But the nomination of an executor by will, be|ing an univer&s;al title effectual <HI>jure gentium,</HI> ought to be &s;u&s;tained every where. Yet letters of admini&s;tration, from the prerogative|court of Canterbury for example, will not be &s;u&s;tained here, even though granted to the next of kin; for the powers of that court are confined within its own territory, and therefore the next of kin mu&s;t be confirmed here.</P>
<P>In the fourth place, as to moveables connected with an immoveable &s;ubject, &s;uch as the furniture of a hou&s;e, the goods in a &s;hop, or the &s;tocking of a farm; the country of the principal determines that of the acce&s;&s;ory, without regard to the proprietor, of whatever country he be. The connection here between the moveables and the im|moveable &s;ubject, prevails over their connection with the proprietor: and accordingly where the principal &s;ubject is in Scotland, the&s;e ac|ce&s;&s;ory moveables will, to all intents and purpo&s;es, be governed by the municipal law of Scotland. To illu&s;trate this branch I put the fol|lowing ca&s;e. A family has been long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two land-e&s;tates, one in England, one in Scotland, with two man&s;ion-hou&s;es complete|ly furni&s;hed, which are inhabited by turns. The proprietor dies without children, leaving a brother, and children of a decea&s;ed bro|ther. This makes it a que&s;tion of importance in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to his moveables, whether the law of England or of Scotland be the rule. In England, there is a repre&s;entation in moveables as well as in land; and when a man dies, the children of a decea&s;ed brother or &s;i&s;ter take a &s;hare of the moveables with the brothers and &s;i&s;ters alive: in Scotland, there is no repre&s;entation in moveables. Will this que&s;tion depend on the accident of the proprietor's dying in Eng|land or in Scotland? This will hardly be admitted; for the mind is aver&s;e to make right depend on chance. And yet, ab&s;tracting from this accident, there is no rea&s;on to prefer the law of either country before that of the other. The re&s;ult then is, that the hou&s;ehold-fur|niture in England, as Engli&s;h effects, mu&s;t be di&s;tributed among the next of kin according to the Engli&s;h law; and that the Scotch law be the rule with re&s;pect to the hou&s;ehold-furniture in Scotland.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place, with re&s;pect to a proce&s;s as well as with re&s;pect to le|gal execution, no circum&s;tance is regarded but loco-po&s;ition merely, how|ever occa&s;ional or accidental. A judge has authority over every per&s;on and every legal &s;ubject within his territory; and to whatever country goods may belong, the proprietor or a creditor mu&s;t claim them from
<PB N="358" REF="367">
the court to which they are &s;ubjected for the time. No other judge can give authority to apprehend the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or to &s;eize them by execution for payment of debt.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV. Foreign covenants and deeds re&s;pecting debts.</HEAD>
<P>DEbts due by inhabitants in this country to foreigners, make ano|ther branch of the extraordinary juri&s;diction of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion concerning foreign matters. The form of conveying &s;uch debts <HI>inter vivos,</HI> of tran&s;mitting them from the dead to the living, of attaching them by execution, &amp;c. have not hitherto been brought under general rules; and our judges are ever at a lo&s;s by what law the&s;e particulars ought to be governed, whether by our law, by that of the country where the creditor re&s;ides, or by the <HI>jus gentium.</HI> To get free of this doubt, authors and lawyers are &s;trongly di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;|&s;imilate debts to land, by be&s;towing upon them a local &s;ituation. And yet this fiction, bold as it is, removes not the doubt; for &s;till the que|&s;tion recurs, Where is the debt &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t? whether in the ter|ritory of the creditor or in that of the debtor? Con&s;idering a debt as a <HI>&s;ubject</HI> belonging to the creditor, it &s;eems the more natural fiction to place it with the creditor as in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and hence the maxim, <HI>Mobilia non habent &s;equelam.</HI> Others are more di&s;po&s;ed to place it with the debtor; a thought &s;ugge&s;ted from con&s;idering, that the money mu&s;t be demanded from the debtor, and that upon his failure the &s;uit for payment mu&s;t be in his <HI>forum.</HI></P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to be&s;tow words upon proving, that a debt is not a <HI>corpus</HI> to be capable of loco-po&s;ition, but purely a <HI>jus incorporale.</HI> Rejecting then fictions, which never tend to &s;ound knowledge, let us take things as they are, and endeavour to draw light from the nature of the &s;ubject. Here are two per&s;ons connected, a debtor and a cre|ditor, living in different countries, and &s;ubjected to different laws. In this ca&s;e it mu&s;t even at fir&s;t &s;ight appear, that there can be no rea&s;on for holding by the one law in every particular, rejecting the other; for whether is it the law of the debtor or of the creditor that mu&s;t be preferred? Deliberating upon this matter, it appears evi|dent, that as payment mu&s;t be demanded in the <HI>forum</HI> of the debtor, the form of the action that is brought again&s;t him, the method of procedure, the execution that pa&s;&s;es upon the decree, and what per|&s;on is liable as heir in place of the debtor dying before payment,
<PB N="359" REF="368">
mu&s;t all be regulated by the law of the debtor's country. On the o|ther hand, with re&s;pect to titles derived from the creditor, whether <HI>inter vivos</HI> or by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the&s;e naturally are regulated by the law of the creditor's country. Thus, an a&s;&s;ignment made by a creditor in Scotland, according to our form, of a debt due to him by a per&s;on in a foreign country, ought to be &s;u&s;tained in that country as a good title for demanding payment: and a foreign a&s;&s;ignment of a debt due here, regular according to the law of the country, ought to be &s;u&s;tained by our judges. A foreign a&s;&s;ignment cannot at any rate be &s;ubjected to the regulations of our act 1681, for preventing forge|ry, nor to any other of our regulations; becau&s;e the&s;e regard no deeds but what are executed in Scotland. The &s;ame with re&s;pect to heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. If a man make a &s;ettlement of his effects ac|cording to the forms of his own country, that &s;ettlement ought to be &s;u&s;tained every where. And if he die inte&s;tate, the heir that is call|ed to &s;ucceed him by the law of his own country, ought to be in|titled to his moveable effects where-ever &s;ituated, and to demand pay|ment from his debtors where-ever found: for when a man forbears to make a deed regulating his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, it is under&s;tood to be his will that the law of his own country take place; if he be &s;atisfied with the heir whom the law calls to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he has no occa&s;ion to make a &s;ettlement. Thus, in a competition between the brother and the nephew of Captain William Brown, who died, in Scotland his native country, inte&s;tate and without children, concerning move|able debts due to the Captain in Ireland, the brother was preferred as next in kin by the law of Scotland; though by the laws of England and Ireland, which admit the <HI>jus reprae&s;entationis</HI> in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of moveables, a nephew and niece have the &s;ame right with a brother and &s;i&s;ter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nov. 28. 1744, Brown of Braid contra John Brown merchant in Edinburgh.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From what is &s;aid it will appear, that, with re&s;pect to the matter in hand, debts differ widely from land and from moveables. It is in vain to claim the property of any &s;ubject, unle&s;s the title of pro|perty be complete and &s;trictly formal. An equitable title in oppo&s;i|tion to one that is legal, can never found a real action: it cannot have a &s;tronger effect than to found an action again&s;t the proprietor to grant a more formal right; or in his default, that the court &s;hould grant it. But in the ca&s;e of a debt, where the que&s;tion is not about property but about payment, an equitable title coincides in a good mea&s;ure with a legal title. An a&s;&s;ignment made by a foreign creditor
<PB N="360" REF="369">
according to the formalities of his country, will be &s;u&s;tained here as a good title for demanding payment from the debtor: and it will be &s;u&s;tained even though informal, provided it be good <HI>jure gentium;</HI> that is, provided it appear that the creditor really granted the a&s;&s;ign|ment. Such effect hath an equitable title; and a legal title can have no &s;tronger effect.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t however be admitted, that an equitable title hath not &s;o complete an effect in a competition. Suppo&s;e an Engli&s;h creditor grants an a&s;&s;ignment in the Engli&s;h form, of a debt due to him in Scotland: this a&s;&s;ignment, though it transfer not the <HI>jus crediti</HI> to the a&s;&s;ignee, is however an order upon the debtor to pay to the a&s;|&s;ignee. But &s;uch a&s;&s;ignment, even though the fir&s;t in order of time, will not avail again&s;t a more formal a&s;&s;ignment taken <HI>bona fide,</HI> and regularly intimated to the debtor. An equitable title may be good again&s;t the granter; but can never be &s;u&s;tained in a competition with a legal title, where both parties are <HI>in pari ca&s;u.</HI></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to debts due here to foreigners, it is a que&s;tion not le&s;s intricate than important, in what manner they are to be attach|ed by execution, and from what court the execution mu&s;t i&s;&s;ue, whe|ther from the court to which the creditor is &s;ubjected or from that of the debtor. In England, debts, like other moveables, are attached by the legal execution of <HI>Fieri facies,</HI> &s;imilar to our poinding&punc; and by that execution the <HI>jus crediti</HI> is transferred <HI>funditus</HI> from the original creditor to his creditor. At this rate it would &s;eem, that a <HI>Fieri facies</HI> executed again&s;t the creditor in England, &s;hould, like an intimated a&s;&s;ignment, be effectual again&s;t the debtor here, &s;o as to make execution in this country unnece&s;&s;ary. This inference appears extremely plau&s;ible, but we mu&s;t inquire whether it be &s;olidly founded. Judicial powers, which are &s;trictly territorial, re&s;emble not will nor con&s;ent, which operate every where with equal authority. A volun|tary conveyance by a proprietor, or by a creditor, is an univer&s;al title that ought to be made effectual by judges in every country: and could law compel any man to make a conveyance, &s;uch conveyance would in ju&s;tice be equivalent to a voluntary conveyance, to be ef|fectual every where. But it is not in the power of law to force the will; and therefore a conveyance by legal execution cannot be held a conveyance from the debtor. In order to &s;upply the want of a vo|luntary conveyance, all that can be done is for the judge to be the di&s;poner; and that di&s;po&s;ition he can make where the &s;ubject to be convey'd is under his power and authority. In our poinding, for example, the property of the goods is transferred to the poinder, not
<PB N="361" REF="370">
by the will of the debtor, but by the will and authority of the &s;he|riff within who&s;e territory the effects lie: but the &s;heriff cannot ad|judge to the poinder the debtor's effects in any other territory, be|cau&s;e the&s;e are not &s;ubjected to his juri&s;diction. The matter is clear as to moveable goods, and the &s;ame rule mu&s;t hold as to debts; for if the creditor cannot be compelled to make a conveyance, all that can be done by way of authority is, to award execution again&s;t his debtor for payment of the debt upon which the execution pro|ceeds. But this execution mu&s;t be awarded by the judge within who&s;e territory the debtor re&s;ides; for no other judge hath authority over him. Thus it is evident, that an Engli&s;h <HI>Fieri facies</HI> is not a good title for demanding payment of a debt due in Scotland. And therefore, with re&s;pect to legal execution, it holds in general, that the judge of the territory within which the &s;ubjects are, or the debtor lives, mu&s;t be applied to.</P>
<P>I conclude this &s;ection with applying to debts, what is ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to moveables in the &s;ection immediately foregoing. The nomination of an executor in a te&s;tament, is an univer&s;al title which ought to be &s;u&s;tained every where; and is always &s;u&s;tained in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion to oblige debtors in this country to make payment <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, Feb. 16. 1627, Law&s;on contra Kello.</NOTE>.

<P>The &s;ame rule obtains even though the foreign bond bear a clau&s;e for regi&s;tering in Scotland.

<HEAD>SECT. VI. What effect is given to foreign &s;tatutes and decrees.</HEAD>
<P>THough a &s;tatute, as ob&s;erved above, hath no authority as &s;uch <HI>extra territorium;</HI> it becomes however nece&s;&s;ary, upon many occa&s;ions, to lay weight upon foreign &s;tatutes, in order to fulfil the rules of ju&s;tice. Many examples occur of indirect effects given thus to foreign &s;tatutes. One of the&s;e effects I &s;hall mention at pre&s;ent for the &s;ake of illu&s;tration; re&s;erving others to be handled where particular &s;tatutes are taken under con&s;ideration. Obedience is due to the laws of our country, and to trangre&s;s any of them is a moral wrong <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See p. 179.</NOTE>. This moral wrong ought to weigh with judges in every country; becau&s;e it is an act of inju&s;tice to &s;upport any moral wrong, by making it the foundation either of an action or of an exception. I give for an example the &s;tatute prohibiting any member of a court of law to buy land about which there is a proce&s;s depending <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">13. Edward I. cap. 49. Act 216. parl. 1594.</NOTE>. Such a purcha&s;e being made notwith&s;tanding, the purcha&s;er follows the vender into a foreign country, in order to compel him by a proce&s;s to make the bargain effectual. A bargain unlawful where made, be|comes not lawful by change of place; and therefore the foreign judge ought not to &s;upport &s;uch unlawful bargain by &s;u&s;taining action upon it. Courts were in&s;tituted to repre&s;s, not to inforce wrong; and the judge who inforces any unlawful paction, becomes acce&s;&s;ory to the wrong.</P>
<P>Several intricate que&s;tions ari&s;e from the different pre&s;criptions that are e&s;tabli&s;hed in different countries. In our deci&s;ions upon that head, it is commonly the point di&s;puted, Whether a foreign pre|&s;cription
<PB N="364" REF="373">
or that of our own country ought to be the rule. This never ought to be a di&s;pute; for every ca&s;e that comes under our own law, mu&s;t be decided by that law, and not by the law of any other country. When the matter is accurately con&s;idered, the de|bate will be found to turn upon a different point, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether the ca&s;e in que&s;tion come under our pre&s;cription. This may often be a doubtful point; becau&s;e many ca&s;es come under the words of a &s;ta|tute, that are not comprehended under its &s;pirit and intendment. Ca&s;es of that nature belong to the juri&s;diction of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, im|powered as a court of equity to mitigate the rigor of &s;tatute-law, by denying force to the words when unwarily more exten&s;ive than the will of the legi&s;lature <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 188.</NOTE>. What only belongs to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, is the effect that ought to be given to foreign pre&s;criptions where our own are not applicable; and the &s;ubject thus circum&s;cribed will be found abundantly &s;imple and plain. By the Engli&s;h act of limita|tions <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">21. James I. cap. 16. &sect; 3.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline">"All actions of account and upon the ca&s;e, all actions of debt grounded upon any lending or contract without &s;peciality, all actions of debt for arrearages of rent, &amp;c. &s;hall be &s;ued with|in &s;ix years after the cau&s;e of action."</Q> The purpo&s;e of this &s;tatute is to guard again&s;t a &s;econd demand for payment of temporary debts, &s;uch as generally are paid regularly: and to make that pur|po&s;e effectual, action is denied upon &s;uch debts after &s;ix years. As &s;tatutes have no coercive authority <HI>extra territorium,</HI> this &s;tatute can have no effect with us other than to infer a pre&s;umption of payment from the &s;ix years delay of bringing an action. And accordingly, when a proce&s;s is brought in Scotland for payment of an Engli&s;h debt after the Engli&s;h pre&s;cription has taken place, it cannot be pleaded here that the action is cut off by the &s;tatute of limitations: but it can be pleaded here, and will be &s;u&s;tained, that the debt is pre&s;umed to have been paid. Con&s;idering that the &s;tatute can have no authority here, except to infer a pre&s;umption of payment, it follows, that the plaintiff mu&s;t be permitted to defeat the pre&s;ump|tion by po&s;itive evidence, or to overbalance it by contrary pre&s;ump|tions, or to &s;how from the circum&s;tances of his ca&s;e that payment cannot be pre&s;umed. As to po&s;itive evidence, the pur&s;uer has ac|ce&s;s to the oath of the defendant; and an acknowledgement that the debt is &s;till exi&s;ting defeats the pre&s;umption of payment <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">February 9. 1738, Rutherford contra Sir James Campbell.</NOTE>. The pre|&s;umptive payment may al&s;o be counterbalanced by contrary pre|&s;umptions.
<PB N="365" REF="374">
A ca&s;e of this nature is reported by Gilmour <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">November 1664, Garden contra Ram&s;ay.</NOTE>, to the following purpo&s;e: <Q REND="inline">"A bond pre&s;cribed by the Engli&s;h law while the parties re&s;ided there, was afterwards made the foundation of a proce&s;s in Scotland. The court refu&s;ed to &s;u&s;tain the Engli&s;h pre|&s;cription, becau&s;e the bond was drawn in the Scotch form be|twixt Scotchmen, and bore a clau&s;e of regi&s;tration for execution in Scotland."</Q> The circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e &s;how, that the creditor laid his account to receive payment in Scotland, or to rai&s;e his action there; and as a bond bearing a clau&s;e of regi&s;tration pre&s;cribes not in Scotland till forty years elap&s;e, the court ju&s;tly thought, that to pre&s;erve the claim alive the creditor had no occa&s;ion to guard again&s;t any pre&s;cription but that of Scotland. Further, there are circum|&s;tances where the &s;tatute of limitation cannot infer any pre&s;umption of payment. What if the debtor within the &s;ix years did retire be|yond &s;ea? The forbearance in that ca&s;e to bring an action again&s;t a man who cannot ea&s;ily be reached, and who&s;e re&s;idence perhaps is not known, cannot infer the &s;lighte&s;t pre&s;umption again&s;t the credi|tor. The &s;tatute however, which makes no exception, mu&s;t in Eng|land have been obeyed, till the defect was &s;upplied by another &s;ta|tute. But the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion is under no &s;uch dilemma: a pre|&s;umption of payment will not be &s;u&s;tained when the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e admit not &s;uch pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>The foregoing defect of the &s;tatute of limitations is &s;upplied by the Engli&s;h &s;tatute 4<HI>to Aunae, cap.</HI> 16. declaring, <Q REND="inline">"That where the per&s;on again&s;t whom a claim lies is beyond &s;eas, the &s;tatute of limitation &s;hall not run again&s;t the creditor."</Q> This &s;tatute is al&s;o defective, becau&s;e it includes not Scotland; for a pre&s;umption of payment cannot ju&s;tly be urged again&s;t an Engli&s;h creditor, who for|bears to &s;ue while his debtor is out of England though not beyond &s;ea. Action however mu&s;t be denied in England by force of the &s;tatute, though the debtor has been all along in Scotland. But this is no rule to us: we are at liberty to judge of the weight of the pre|&s;umption from circum&s;tances; and accordingly the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion &s;u&s;tained action after the &s;ix years again&s;t a man who re&s;ided mo&s;t of the time in Scotland <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">March 4. 1755, Tru&s;tees for the creditors of Renton contra Baillie.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though the act of limitations of James I. makes no provi&s;ion for the ca&s;e where the debtor happens to be in a different country, it is more circum&s;pect as to the creditor's re&s;idence. For in the 7th &s;ec|tion
<PB N="366" REF="375">
it is provided, <Q REND="inline">"That the pre&s;cription &s;hall not run again&s;t the creditor while he is beyond &s;eas:"</Q> and ju&s;tly, becau&s;e in that &s;i|tuation his delaying to bring an action infers not again&s;t him any pre&s;umption of payment. The ca&s;e is parallel where the creditor happens to re&s;ide in Scotland, and therefore his re&s;idence there mu&s;t al&s;o bar a pre&s;umption of payment. Hence it appears that the de|ci&s;ion, July 1717, Rae contra Wright, is erroneous: and indeed it is &s;o in more re&s;pects than one. James Rae a Scotch pedlar having died in England, his brother Richard intermeddled with his effects there at &s;hort hand without any warrant. Richard, during the run|ning of the &s;ix years, returned to Dumfries, and died there. After the &s;ix years were elap&s;ed, a proce&s;s was brought again&s;t his execu|tor by William Rae, a third brother, to account to him for the half of the effects thus irregularly intermeddled with. The court &s;u&s;tain|ed the defence, That the action was cut off by the Engli&s;h &s;tatute of limitations. This was unju&s;t. While Richard remained in Eng|land, the circum&s;tance that William, living in Scotland, forbore to rai&s;e a &s;uit in England, afforded not the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion that he had received payment from Richard. And &s;uppo&s;e he had lived in England, payment could not be pre&s;umed again&s;t him, when his debtor left England before the lap&s;e of the &s;ix years.</P>
<P>By e&s;tabli&s;hed practice in England, action is not &s;u&s;tained upon a double bond after twenty years. The intere&s;t at the rate of <HI>5 per cent.</HI> equals the principal in twenty years, which therefore exhau&s;ts the whole penal part of the bond, and makes the double &s;um due in equity as well as at common law. After this period, the &s;um mu&s;t remain barren, becau&s;e intere&s;t is not &s;tipulated in the bond: and in that view, it is ju&s;tly inferred from the delay of demanding pay|ment after the twenty years, that payment mu&s;t already have been made. This in effect is an Engli&s;h pre&s;cription, inferring from long delay a pre&s;umption of payment. It follows therefore, if the debtor have lived all along in England, and the creditor have &s;uffered the pre&s;cription to run again&s;t him, that the pre&s;umptive payment ought to be &s;u&s;tained here as in England.</P>
<P>In the Engli&s;h bankrupt &s;tatute, 13th Eli&s;abeth, cap. 7. &sect; 2. it is enacted, <Q REND="inline">"That the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall have power to &s;ell all the goods of the bankrupt, real and per&s;onal, which he had before his bankruptcy, and to divide the produce among the creditors in proportion to the extent of their debts;"</Q> and &sect; 12. it is declared, <Q REND="inline">"That this act &s;hall not extend to land aliened <HI>bona fide</HI> before the bankruptcy."</Q> Hence it appears to be the intention and effect of
<PB N="367" REF="376">
the &s;tatute, to bar all deeds by the bankrupt, and all execution by the creditors, after the fir&s;t act of bankruptcy. And the Engli&s;h wri|ters accordingly invent a cau&s;e &s;ufficient to &s;upport the&s;e &s;tatutory ef|fects. They hold, that the effects are ve&s;ted in the commi&s;&s;ioners <HI>retro</HI> from the fir&s;t act of bankruptcy: <Q REND="inline">"Creditors upon what&s;oever &s;ecurity they be, come in all equal, unle&s;s &s;uch as have obtained actual execution before the bankruptcy, or had taken pledges for their ju&s;t debts; and the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e, from the act of bank|ruptcy, all the bankrupt's e&s;tate is ve&s;ted in the commi&s;&s;ioners <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New abridgement of the law, vol. 1. p. 258.</NOTE>:"</Q> A &s;trange fiction, to &s;uppo&s;e the bankrupt's e&s;tate ve&s;ted in the com|mi&s;&s;ioners, before the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners be named or have a being! The &s;tatute has a better foundation than a fiction: it is founded on ju&s;t principles of equity, as is demon&s;trated above <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 5. of this book.</NOTE>. But to con|fine our ob&s;ervations upon the &s;tatute to what more peculiarly con|cerns this country, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the great circulation of trade through the two kingdoms &s;ince the union, makes it frequently ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion to take the Engli&s;h bankrupt &s;tatutes under con&s;ideration; and it has puzzled the court mightily, what effect &s;hould be given to them here. That a foreign &s;tatute cannot have any coercive authority <HI>extra territorium,</HI> is clear: but at fir&s;t view it is not &s;o clear, that the &s;tatutory transference of property a|bove mentioned, from the bankrupt to the commi&s;&s;ioners, may not comprehend effects real or per&s;onal in Scotland, or in any other fo|reign country; for why may not a legal conveyance be equivalent to a voluntary conveyance by the proprietor him&s;elf? I have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve above <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sect. 4. of the pre&s;ent chapter.</NOTE>, that law cannot force the will, nor com|pel any man to make a conveyance: in place of a voluntary con|veyance, when ju&s;tice requires it to be granted, all that a court can do, or the legi&s;lature can do, is to be them&s;elves the di&s;poners; and it is evident that their deed of conveyance cannot reach any &s;ubject real or per&s;onal but what is within their territory. This makes a &s;o|lid difference between a voluntary and a legal conveyance. The former has no relation to place: a deed of alienation, whether of land or of moveables, is good where-ever granted: an Engli&s;hman, for example, has in China the &s;ame power to alien his land in Eng|land, that he had before he left his native country; and the power he has to di&s;po&s;e of his moveables will reach them in the mo&s;t di|&s;tant corner of the earth. The latter, on the contrary, has the &s;trict|e&s;t
<PB N="368" REF="377">
relation to place: the power of a court, and even of the legi&s;la|ture, being merely territorial, reacheth not lands nor moveables <HI>ex|tra territorium.</HI> We may then &s;afely conclude, that the &s;tatutory transference of property from the bankrupt to the commi&s;&s;ioners, cannot carry any effects in Scotland: the&s;e are &s;ubjected to our own laws, and our own judges, and cannot be convey'd from one per&s;on to another by the authority of any foreign court, or of any foreign &s;tatute. The Engli&s;h bankrupt &s;tatutes however mu&s;t not be totally di&s;regarded by us. One effect may and ought to be given them according to the rules of ju&s;tice and equity: it is the duty of the debtor to &s;ell his effects for &s;atisfying his creditors if he cannot otherwi&s;e procure money; and it is in particular the duty of an Eng|li&s;h bankrupt, to convey all his effects to the commi&s;&s;ioners named by the chancellor, or to the a&s;&s;ignees named by the creditors, in or|der to be &s;old for payment of his debts: the Engli&s;h &s;tatute, by con|veying to the commi&s;&s;ioners all the Engli&s;h funds, &s;upplies the fail|ure of the bankrupt, and does for him what he him&s;elf ought to do: but as the Engli&s;h &s;tatute has no authority over funds belonging to the bankrupt in Scotland, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for the commi&s;|&s;ioners or a&s;&s;ignees to apply to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"&s;pecifying the debtor's bankruptcy, and his failure to make a conveyance; and therefore praying that the court will adjudge to the plaintiffs the debtor's effects in Scotland; or rather that they will order the &s;ame to be &s;old, and the price to be paid to the plaintiffs."</Q> And to that purpo&s;e, the proper action, in my apprehen&s;ion, is a proce&s;s of &s;ale of the debtor's moveables as well as of his land. Debts due here to the bankrupt may al&s;o be &s;old; but as again&s;t &s;olvent debt|ors a proce&s;s for payment is better management, it appears that, in in the ca&s;e of bankruptcy, this proce&s;s is competent to the a&s;&s;ignees without nece&s;&s;ity of an arre&s;tment <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 4. of this book.</NOTE>. The a&s;&s;ignees being tru&s;tees for behoof of the whole creditors, have a claim in equity to the bankrupt's whole effects, to be converted into money for payment of the creditors; and in the forms of the law of Scotland there appears nothing to bar the a&s;&s;ignees from bringing a direct action for pay|ment again&s;t the bankrupt's debtors here, as he him&s;elf could have done before his bankruptcy. In thus appointing the bankrupt's debtors to make payment to the a&s;&s;ignees, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion goes no farther than to &s;u&s;tain the &s;aid equitable claim, and exerts no power but what is the foundation of all legal execution, <HI>viz.</HI> making that conveyance for the bankrupt which he him&s;elf ought to have
<PB N="369" REF="378">
made. By this expeditious method, ju&s;tice is &s;atisfied, and no per&s;on is hurt.</P>
<P>Whether the price of the bankrupt's moveable funds, and the &s;um ari&s;ing from the debts due to him, ought to be di&s;tributed here a|mong his creditors, or be remitted to England for that purpo&s;e, is a matter purely of expediency. The rule of di&s;tribution &s;eems to be the &s;ame in both countries; and the creditors therefore have no intere&s;t in the que&s;tion, except what may ari&s;e from the convenience of re|ceiving payment in one place rather than in another. But if the bank|rupt's land in Scotland have been attached by execution, which is al|mo&s;t always the ca&s;e, the price of it upon a &s;ale mu&s;t be di&s;tributed here; for the purcha&s;er is not bound to pay the price till the real debts be convey'd to him, and the real creditors are not bound to convey till they get payment.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place come foreign decrees: which are of two kinds; one &s;u&s;taining the claim, and one di&s;mi&s;&s;ing it. A foreign decree &s;u&s;taining the claim, is not one of tho&s;e univer&s;al titles which ought to be made effectual every where. It is a title that depends on the authority of the court whence it i&s;&s;ued, and therefore has no coercive authority <HI>extra territorium.</HI> And yet as it would be hard to oblige the per&s;on who claims on a decree, to bring a new action again&s;t his party in every country to which he may retire; therefore com|mon utility, as well as regard to a &s;i&s;ter court, have e&s;tabli&s;hed a rule among all civilized nations, That a foreign decree &s;hall be put in exe|cution, unle&s;s &s;ome good exception be oppo&s;ed to it in law or equi|ty. This, in effect, is making no wider &s;tep in favour of the decree, than to pre&s;ume it ju&s;t till the contrary be proved. But this in|cludes not a decree decerning for a penalty; becau&s;e no court rec|kons it&s;elf bound to puni&s;h, or to concur in puni&s;hing, any delict committed <HI>extra territorium.</HI></P>
<P>A foreign decree which, by di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the claim, a&s;&s;ords an <HI>ex|ceptio rei judicatae</HI> again&s;t it, enjoys a more exten&s;ive privilege. We not only pre&s;ume it to be ju&s;t, but will not admit any evidence of its being unju&s;t. The rea&s;on follows. Public utility, regarding the &s;afety and quiet of individuals, requires that there be &s;ome means for putting a final i&s;&s;ue to every controver&s;y that can be brought be|fore a court; for otherwi&s;e law-&s;uits would be perpetual. A decree di&s;mi&s;&s;ing a claim, is in its nature ultimate; and &s;uch decree there|fore mu&s;t put an end to the controver&s;y, if ever it be to have an end. The effect then given to an <HI>exceptio rei judicatae,</HI> is derived from the common intere&s;t of mankind. A decree di&s;mi&s;&s;ing a claim, may, it
<PB N="370" REF="379">
is true, be unju&s;t, as well as a decree &s;u&s;taining it. But they differ widely in one capital point: in declining to give redre&s;s again&s;t a de|cree di&s;mi&s;&s;ing a claim, the court is not guilty of authori&s;ing inju|&s;tice, even &s;uppo&s;ing the decree to be unju&s;t: the utmo&s;t that can be &s;aid is, that the court forbears to interpo&s;e in behalf of ju|&s;tice; but &s;uch forbearance, in&s;tead of being faulty, is highly me|ritorious in every ca&s;e where private ju&s;tice cla&s;hes with public utility <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Conclu&s;ion of book 2.</NOTE>. The ca&s;e is very different with re&s;pect to a decree of the other kind; for to award execution upon a foreign decree without admitting any objection again&s;t it, would be, for ought the court can know, to &s;upport and promote inju&s;tice. A court, as well as an individual, may in certain circum&s;tances have rea|&s;on to forbear acting, or executing their office: but the doing in|ju&s;tice, or the &s;upporting it, cannot be ju&s;tified in any circum|&s;tances <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

But in ca&s;e no per&s;on appear to claim, there is the following provi&s;o: <Q REND="inline">"That goods which are in their nature peri&s;hable, &s;hall be forthwith &s;old by the collector; and that, after deducting all charges, the re|&s;idue of the price, with a fair and ju&s;t account of the whole, &s;hall be tran&s;mitted to the exchequer, there to remain for the benefit of the rightful owner; and that the &s;ame &s;hall be delivered to him &s;o &s;oon as he appears, and makes a claim."</Q></P>
<P>Brunton and Chalmers, owners of a ve&s;&s;el called <HI>The Serpent's prize,</HI> loaded the &s;ame with 100 quarters of wheat for Zealand. In her voyage &s;he was &s;tranded at a place called <HI>Red&s;car,</HI> near the town of Stocktown. Chalmers having got notice of the accident, repaired immediately to Red&s;car; and found his wheat in the hands of John Wil&s;on collector of the cu&s;toms at Stocktown; part of it laid up in
<PB N="371" REF="380">
lofts, and part in the open field; the whole greatly damaged by &s;ea|water. Finding it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;po&s;e of the wheat in&s;tantly, he ap|plied to the collector for liberty to &s;ell; offering to put the price in his hand as &s;ecurity for the &s;alvage. This being ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed, he took a prote&s;t again&s;t the collector, and brought again&s;t him an action of tre&s;pa&s;s upon the ca&s;e before the King's bench. And the defendant having put him&s;elf upon his country, the cau&s;e came to a trial at Newca&s;tle; where a &s;pecial verdict was returned, in &s;ub&s;tance finding, <Q REND="inline">"That all rea&s;onable care was taken of the wheat by the collector, and others by his order: That on the 3d of October then next following, James Chalmers applied to the collector, de&s;iring that the wheat, being much damaged, might be forthwith &s;old; and that the money produced by &s;uch &s;ale might be left in the hand of the collector to an&s;wer all charges; but did not then offer to pay to the collector any money for &s;alvage: neither did the collector then make any demand on that account, he not know|ing at that time what the &s;alvage amounted to; but then refu&s;ed to deliver the &s;aid wheat, or permit the &s;ame to be &s;old, he having an order from the commi&s;&s;ioners of his Maje&s;ty's cu&s;toms for that purpo&s;e."</Q> And the verdict concludes thus: <Q REND="inline">"But whether, upon the whole matter afore&s;aid by the &s;aid jurors in form afore|&s;aid found, the within-named John Wil&s;on be guilty of the pre|mi&s;&s;es within written or not, the &s;aid jurors are altogether igno|rant, and pray advice from the court thereupon."</Q> The judge at that circuit having referred the cau&s;e to the court of King's bench at We&s;tmin&s;ter, judgement was at la&s;t there given on the 18th July 1751, after &s;everal continuations, <Q REND="inline">"Finding, That the &s;aid John Wil&s;on is not guilty of the premi&s;&s;es; that the &s;aid Brunton and Chalmers &s;hall take nothing by their &s;aid bill; but that they be in mercy, &amp;c. for their fal&s;e claim; and that the &s;aid John Wil|&s;on go thereof without day, &amp;c. And it is further con&s;idered, That the &s;aid John recover again&s;t the &s;aid Brunton and Chalmers &s;ixty pounds, for his co&s;ts and charges laid out by him about his defence on this behalf; and that the &s;aid John have execution there|of,"</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>For this &s;um of L. 60 awarded to the collector for co&s;ts, he brought an action again&s;t Brunton and Chalmers, before the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion; and in &s;upport of his claim &s;et forth, That it is founded on the pre|&s;umption, <HI>Quod res judicata pro veritate habetur.</HI></P>
<P>The defendants in&s;i&s;ted, That this pre&s;umption mu&s;t yield to direct evidence of inju&s;tice, which would clearly appear upon comparing
<PB N="372" REF="381">
the decree with the &s;tatute. And the following circum&s;tances were urged: Fir&s;t, That though the wheat was in a peri&s;hing condition, the collector refu&s;ed to permit the &s;ame to be &s;old, even contrary to his own intere&s;t, as the price to him was a better &s;ecurity for the &s;al|vage than the damaged wheat. Secondly, When the application for &s;ale was made, the collector was not ready to make his claim for &s;alvage, not knowing at that time the amount thereof; and in the&s;e circum&s;tances to forbid the &s;ale, was not only rigorous, but a po&s;itive act of inju&s;tice: it was, to abandon the wheat to de&s;truction, with|out permitting the defendants to interpo&s;e. Even ready money to pay the &s;alvage would not have availed them, &s;eeing the collector was not in a condition to make any demand.</P>
<P>This ca&s;e being reported by the Lord Ordinary, it occurred at advi&s;ing, that the &s;tatute provides nothing about &s;elling peri&s;hable goods, except in the ca&s;e that the merchant does not appear to claim the wrecked goods. Therefore the pre&s;ent ca&s;e is not pro|vided for by the &s;tatute. It is a <HI>ca&s;us omi&s;&s;us,</HI> which in equity mu&s;t be &s;upplied agreeably to the intendment and purpo&s;e of the &s;tatute.</P>
<P>Viewing the matter in this light, it appeared, in the fir&s;t place, that the defendants, being proprietors of the wheat, were intitled to di&s;po&s;e of it, provided the collector &s;uffered no prejudice as to his claim of &s;alvage, which he certainly did not if the price were put in his hand. Nay his &s;ecurity would be improved by the &s;ale, which would afford him current coin in&s;tead of peri&s;hing wheat. It was con&s;idered, in the &s;econd place, that this is agreeable to the intendment of the &s;tatute; for if the cu&s;tomhou&s;e-officer mu&s;t di&s;po&s;e of peri&s;hable goods when there is none to claim, much more where the owner appears, and in&s;i&s;ts for a &s;ale. <HI>3tio,</HI> The &s;tatute, when it intitles the cu&s;tomhou&s;e-officers to retain the goods for &s;ecurity of the &s;alvage, undoubtedly &s;uppo&s;es that the officer can in&s;truct his claim, in order that the merchant may have in&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the goods, upon paying the &s;alvage. In this view the conduct of the collector was altogether unju&s;tifiable. The &s;tatute gives no authority for retaining the goods as a &s;ecurity for the &s;al|vage, unle&s;s as a <HI>&s;uccedaneum</HI> when &s;atisfaction is not offered in money; and as the collector here was not ready to receive &s;atisfac|tion, it was a tre&s;pa&s;s to retain the goods in a peri&s;hing condition, becau&s;e the &s;tatute gave him no authority to act in &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive a manner.</P>
<P>With regard to this matter in general, one ob&s;ervation had great
<PB N="373" REF="382">
weight, That it never could be the intention of the legi&s;lature, to force merchants fir&s;t to pay &s;alvage, and thereafter to undergo the ri&s;k of peri&s;hable and damnified goods, the price of which po&s;&s;ibly might not amount to the &s;alvage. If the goods be abandoned to tho&s;e who &s;ave them, there can be no claim for &s;alvage; for &s;alvage can never exceed the benefit procured by it. Upon this footing the collector could not in common ju&s;tice demand more than the value of the goods for his &s;alvage; and <HI>a fortiori</HI> could not demand any &s;ecurity beyond that value. The court accordingly unanimou&s;ly refu&s;ed to interpo&s;e their authority for execution upon this judge|ment <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">January 6. 1756&punc; John Wil&s;on collector of the cu&s;toms at Stocktown contra Robert Brunton and James Chalmers merchants in Edinburgh.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This judgement of the King's bench may po&s;&s;ibly be ju&s;tified as pro|nounced by a court of common law, which, in interpreting &s;tatutes, mu&s;t adhere to the letter, without regarding the intention of the legi&s;la|ture. If &s;o, the proprietors of the wheat ought to have applied to the chancery, or have removed their cau&s;e there by a <HI>Certiorari.</HI> If courts of common law in England be &s;o confined, their con&s;titution is ex|tremely imperfect. But &s;uppo&s;ing the court of King's bench to have acted properly according to its con&s;titution, it was notwith&s;tand|ing right in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, to refu&s;e execution upon a foreign decree that is materially unju&s;t, or contrary to equity.</P>
<P>An appeal entered by Collector Wil&s;on was heard <HI>ex parte,</HI> and the decree of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion rever&s;ed; by which the L. 60 of co&s;ts decerned in the court of King's bench was made effectual a|gain&s;t Chalmers and Brunton.</P>
<P>The decree, if I have been rightly informed, was rever&s;ed for the following rea&s;on; that in England the decree of a foreign &s;upreme court has &s;uch credence, that judgement is immediately given, with|out entering into the merits, provided the matter have been litiga|ted; that in all countries the decrees of the court of admiralty are, for the &s;ake of commerce, intitled to immediate execution; and that the &s;ame credence ought to have been given by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion to the judgement of the King's bench.</P>
<P>Hence it would appear, that in England greater authority is given to foreign decrees than in any other civilized country; and indeed great|er than can be ju&s;tified from the nature and con&s;titution of any court. A foreign decree has no legal authority in England; and for the courts of We&s;tmin&s;ter blindly to authori&s;e execution upon a foreign decree, without admitting any objection again&s;t it, is a practice that
<PB N="374" REF="383">
cannot be approved, becau&s;e it mu&s;t frequently lead them to autho|ri&s;e inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But admitting the practice of England, it ought to have been con|&s;idered, that the practice of England is no authority in Scotland. In reviewing the decrees of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, the law of Scotland is the rule. And if the decree in que&s;tion was agreeable to the law of <HI>Scotland,</HI> it ought to have been affirmed; e&s;pecially as the law of Scotland with re&s;pect to foreign decrees is not only in it&s;elf rational, but agreeable to the laws of all other civilized nations, England ex|cepted. The hou&s;e of Lords, we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, could not intend to try the merits of a Scotch decree by the law or practice of Eng|land. But as the appeal was heard <HI>ex parte,</HI> the rever&s;al has certain|ly been founded upon the erroneous &s;uppo&s;ition, That, with re&s;pect to foreign decrees, the practice of Scotland is the &s;ame with that of England.</P>

<HEAD>NOTANDUM BENE.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many divi&s;ions of human actions in the prelimina|ry di&s;cour&s;e, there is one all along &s;uppo&s;ed, but not brought out into a clear light. It is what follows: 1. Actions that we are bound to perform. 2. Actions that we perform in pro&s;ecution of our rights or privileges. 3. Actions that are entirely voluntary or arbitrary; &s;uch as are done for amu&s;ement, or from an impul&s;e to act without having any end in view. Thus one leaps, runs, throws &s;tones, merely to exert &s;trength or activity; which therefore are in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e voluntary.</P>
<P>In the preliminary di&s;cour&s;e, p. 26. we have the following pro|po&s;ition, That the moral &s;en&s;e prohibits every action that may pro|bably do mi&s;chief; and therefore, that if the probability of mi&s;chief be fore&s;een, or may be fore&s;een, the action is culpable or faulty. In &s;tating this propo&s;ition no actions were in view but the la&s;t in the foregoing divi&s;ion; and it was an omi&s;&s;ion not to confine the propo|&s;ition to the&s;e; for it holds not with re&s;pect to actions done in pro&s;e|cution of our rights or privileges. Such actions are governed by a different principle, mentioned p. 58, That the probability of mi&s;|chief, even fore&s;een, prohibits me not from following out my rights or privileges. And it is happily &s;o ordered by nature. When we act merely for amu&s;ement, it is a &s;alutary and ju&s;t regulation, that we &s;hould be an&s;werable for what harm we do that either is fore|&s;een or may be fore&s;een. But our rights and privileges would be very little beneficial to us, were we put under the &s;ame re&s;traint in making the&s;e effectual. What actions may be lawfully done in pro&s;ecuting our rights and privileges, are handled book 1. part 1. chap. 1. &s;ect. 1. What actions may be lawfully done without ha|ving in view to pro&s;ecute any right or privilege, are handled in the &s;ection immediately &s;ub&s;equent.</P>
