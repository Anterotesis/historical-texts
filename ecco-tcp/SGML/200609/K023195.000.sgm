<P>_THE Hint of the following Piece was taken from <HI>Chaucer</HI>'s <HI>Hou&s;e of Fame.</HI> The De&s;ign is in a man|ner entirely alter'd, the De&s;crip|tions and mo&s;t of the particular Thoughts my own: Yet I could not &s;uffer it to be printed with|out this Acknowledgment, or think a Concealment of this Nature the le&s;s unfair for being common.

<HEAD>NOTES.</HEAD>
<P>_SOME modern Criticks, from a pre|tended Refinement of Ta&s;te, have declar'd them&s;elves unable to reli&s;h allegorical Poems. 'Tis not ea&s;y to penetrate into the meaning of this Critici&s;m; for if <HI>Fable</HI> be al|low'd one of the chief Beauties, or as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> calls it, the very <HI>Soul</HI> of Poetry, 'tis hard to com|prehend how that Fable &s;hould be the le&s;s valua|ble for having a Moral. The Ancients con&s;tantly made u&s;e of Allegories: My Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> has com|pos'd an expre&s;s Treati&s;e in proof of this, entitled, <HI>The Wi&s;dom of the Antients;</HI> where the Reader may &s;ee &s;everal particular Fictions exemplify'd and explain'd with great Clearne&s;s, Judgment and Learning. The Incidents indeed, by which the Al|legory is convey'd, mu&s;t be vary'd, according to the different Genius or Manners of different Times: and they &s;hould never be &s;pun too long, or too much clogg'd with trivial Circum&s;tances, or little Parti|cularities. We find an uncommon Charm in Truth, when it is convey'd by this Side-way to our &V;nder|&s;tanding; and 'tis ob&s;ervable, that even in the mo&s;t ignorant Ages this way of Writing has found Reception. Almo&s;t all the Poems in the old <HI>Pro|ven&ccedil;al</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="44">
had this Turn; and from the&s;e it was that <HI>Petrarch</HI> took the Idea of his Poetry. We have his <HI>Trionfi</HI> in this kind; and <HI>Boccace</HI> pur&s;u'd in the &s;ame Track. Soon after <HI>Chau|cer</HI> introduc'd it here, who&s;e <HI>Romaunt of the Ro&s;e, Court of Love, Flower and the Leaf, Hou&s;e of Fame,</HI> and &s;ome others of his Wri|tings are Ma&s;ter-pieces of this &s;ort. In Epick Poetry, 'tis true, too nice and exact a Pur&s;uit of the Allegory is ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd a Fault; and <HI>Chau|cer</HI> had the Di&s;cernment to avoid it in his <HI>Knight</HI>'s <HI>Tale,</HI> which was an Attempt towards an Epick Poem. <HI>Ario&s;to,</HI> with le&s;s judgment, gave in|tirely into it in his <HI>Orlando;</HI> which tho' carry'd to an Exce&s;s, had yet &s;o much Reputation in <HI>Italy,</HI> that <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> (who reduc'd Heroick Poetry to the ju&s;ter Standard of the Ancients) was forc'd to prefix to his Work a &s;crupulous Explanation of the Allegory of it, to which the Fable it-&s;elf could &s;carce have directed his Readers. Our Country|man <HI>Spencer</HI> follow'd, who&s;e Poem is almo&s;t intire|ly allegorical, and imitates the manner of <HI>Ario&s;to</HI> rather than that of <HI>Ta&s;&s;o.</HI> &V;pon the whole, one may ob&s;erve this &s;ort of Writing (however di&s;|continu'd of late) was in all Times &s;o far from being rejected by the be&s;t Poets, that &s;ome of them have rather err'd by in&s;i&s;ting in it too clo&s;ely, and carrying it too far: And that to infer from thence that the Allegory it &s;elf is vicious, is a pre|&s;umptuous Contradiction to the Judgment and Practice of the greate&s;t Genius's, both ancient and modern.</P>

<P>Tho' a &s;hort Veri&s;imilitude be not requir'd in the De&s;criptions of this vi&s;ionary and allegorical kind of Poetry, which admits of every wild Object that Fancy may pre&s;ent in a Dream, and where it is &s;ufficient if the moral Meaning atone for the Im|probability: Yet Men are naturally &s;o de&s;irous of Truth, that a Reader is generally pleas'd, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, with &s;ome Excu&s;e or Allu&s;ion that &s;eems to reconcile the De&s;cription to Probability and Na|ture.
