<P>IT is allowed that every State has an inherent right to require evidence that tho&s;e whom it employs in offices of tru&s;t and power, are friendly to its con&s;titution; becau&s;e it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> to be &s;uppo&s;ed that any State would pur&s;ue mea&s;ures de&s;tructive of it&s;elf, which the admi&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e who are ho&s;tile to it, to civil offices, would undoubtedly be.

kind of &s;ecurity. For in&s;tance, it cannot claim a right to &s;uch &s;ecurity, as would make the puni&s;hment of di&s;affection more than adequate to the crime. Nor can it claim a right to &s;uch a dominion over con&s;cience, as would lead to per&s;ecution for religious &s;entiments, con&s;idered merely <HI>as</HI> &s;entiments. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation will hold with re&s;pect to all opinions which have not an <HI>imme|diate</HI> connection with the welfare of the State it&s;elf. Otherwi&s;e, in deducing con&s;equences from opinions, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to have a more remote relation to the State, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to know where to &s;top, there being &s;carcely one principle of a political, moral, or religious nature, but may be repre&s;ented by its enemies as incon&s;i&s;tent with the e&s;tabli&s;hed government. And as various governments are guided by various principles, tho&s;e which are con&s;i&s;tent with one government, may be incon&s;i&s;tent with another; on which &s;uppo&s;ition, the opinions which, in one State, may be regarded as ju&s;t, and nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of the community, may in another be con&s;idered as de&s;tructive of all order and due &s;ubordination. The con&s;equence of which would be, that there could be no &s;uch thing as political truth or rectitude exi&s;ting.</P>
<P>But, let us &s;uppo&s;e the government to be well calculated to advance the general intere&s;ts of the community: let the opinions of which it requires a &s;ecurity, be ju&s;t opinions; yet, if they are &s;uch as have not clearly and <HI>immediately</HI> this connection, the State can have no right to claim any evidence of their being admitted by tho&s;e whom it employs in civil offices. So that both in this and in the former ca&s;e, the&s;e opinions will be found to include, in reality, nothing more than what is implied in the common oaths of allegiance and fid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lity; and a claim of &s;ecu|rity as to &s;uch opinions as the&s;e, is what no one would object to complying with&mdash;though even this is more than can be ju&s;tly pretended to. For the very &s;uppo&s;ition of a claim to &s;ecurity in <HI>opinions,</HI> is in it&s;elf ab&s;urd. Indeed, what does it, at the utmo&s;t, amount to. Merely this: that tho&s;e from whom &s;uch a &s;ecurity is required, &s;hould declare their <HI>belief</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch opinions. But will any State pretend to judge of the &s;incerity of &s;uch a declaration? When pro&s;pects of intere&s;t are placed before him who makes it, can it be po&s;itively known that the&s;e have no influence to bias his mind, and lead him to concealments and re&s;ervations? I do not pretend to &s;ay that this is always, or generally, the fact; but the very po&s;&s;ibility is a clear proof how inadequate Go|vernment is to &s;uch a claim, and con&s;equently that the &s;ecurity it &s;hould require is of a different kind&mdash;a &s;ecurity of <HI>conduct.</HI> This is the only te&s;t on which the community can rea&s;onably depend: and on this it may depend; e&s;pecially if per&s;onal intere&s;t be connected with &s;uch con|duct, which it certainly is, when the mea&s;ures of government are generally u&s;eful to the com|munity. Every other evidence is delu&s;ive; and therefore this only ought to be required.</P>
<P>In determining, al&s;o, the <HI>extent</HI> of this &s;ecurity, it is a que&s;tion of e&s;&s;ential importance, what is meant by the <HI>con&s;titution</HI> to which it is referred. For this may either be con&s;idered as the whole &s;y&s;tem of laws which make up the Government, at <HI>the time of giving the &s;ecurity,</HI> or the ge|neral <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of the Government, without reference to any <HI>particular laws</HI> whatever. Now, for the &s;upport of the former, no one can be expected to engage; becau&s;e on this prin|ciple no grievances can be redre&s;&s;ed, nor even can a &s;ingle &s;tatute be ever abrogated. It mu&s;t be the latter only, then, to which tho&s;e who are employed in civil offices may be expected to give evidence of attachment. It therefore by no means follows, that they may not endeavour the repeal of any &s;tatutes which appear to them incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of the government, though of ever &s;o long a &s;tanding, and ever &s;o uniformly acquie&s;ced in. And whenever &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed with re&s;pect to the executive part of Government, as convey the idea of obligation on tho&s;e who are employed in it, to <HI>pre&s;erve the con&s;titution,</HI> the whole meaning is, that the ge|neral &s;pirit of the government &s;hall be uniformly &s;upported, and the laws enacted from time to time &s;hall be put in execution agreeably to the letter and de&s;ign of them. The utmo&s;t &s;ecurity, therefore, that can be given, is, that this delegation &s;hall be faithfully executed; which it
<PB N="3" REF="3">
certainly may by <HI>all,</HI> what &s;entiments &s;oever they may entertain as to matters of religion or phi|lo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The principle al&s;o on which this &s;ecurity is &s;aid to be claimed, that of <HI>&s;elf-pre&s;ervation,</HI> is an additional proof that this claim can be extended no farther. For this principle is to be re&s;tricted, in &s;ocieties as well as individuals, by rea&s;on and ju&s;tice. Now neither of the&s;e can warrant the claim of more &s;ecurity than is nece&s;&s;ary in this ca&s;e. If, therefore, a &s;olemn engagement on the part of a per&s;on appointed to civil offices, that he will di&s;charge the&s;e offices truly and faithfully, be ju&s;t and complete, no other ought to be required. For the claims of &s;ociety and government are not to be regarded as <HI>indefinite;</HI> but are to be regulated by the &s;ame principles of morality as tho&s;e of individuals; and whenever they are exorbitant, ought to be remon&s;trated again&s;t, and oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the&s;e accounts, the principle which makes the fir&s;t of the re&s;olutions of the Che&s;ter Clergy, ought to have been expre&s;&s;ed in this manner:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Every State, though it has an inherent right to a &s;ecurity from tho&s;e whom it may employ in offices of tru&s;t and power, that they will not pur&s;ue mea&s;ures ho&s;tile to the con&s;titution which it has e&s;tabli&s;hed, has only that right which it is competent to the exertion of; namely, the engaging its officers by a &s;olemn promi&s;e, that that they will not <HI>act</HI> incon&s;i&s;tently with the intere&s;ts of the State. This right ari&s;es from the nature of the &s;ociety it&s;elf, and from the principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. But as to <HI>opinions,</HI> the&s;e being out of the reach of human knowledge, mu&s;t therefore be beyond the extent of human power; and in the&s;e the State cannot, from the nature of the things, have any concern."</Q> Hence, therefore,</P>
<P N="2"><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2. That, upon the &s;ame principle, every &s;tate hath a right to declare what &s;hall be deemed a &s;ufficient proof, or TEST, whether &s;uch opinions are, or are not, friendly to its e&s;tabli&s;hments.</NOTE> II. No &s;tate has a right to any Te&s;t which has for its object <HI>opinions</HI> only, or to one of which <HI>opinions</HI> make a part.</P>
<P>I cannot help, under this head, remarking the palpable ab&s;urdity of the &s;econd re&s;olution of the Che&s;ter clergy. <Q REND="inline">"Every &s;tate hath a right to DECLARE what &s;hall be DEEMED <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">I &s;uppo&s;e this means deemed <HI>by the &s;tate,</HI> for on the&s;e principles there can be <HI>no judge be&s;ides the &s;tate.</HI></NOTE> a &s;ufficient PROOF or TEST, whether &s;uch opinions are or are not friendly to its e&s;tabli&s;h|ments."</Q> I &s;hall not take notice of the artful introduction of the <HI>plural e&s;tabli&s;hments,</HI> in&s;tead of the &s;ingular number, which is the only idea expre&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t re&s;olution, and which is referable to the <HI>civil</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hment only; nor &s;hall I &s;ay any thing of the tendency of &s;uch an alteration to confound the church and &s;tate together, and apply the arguments which relate merely to the latter, to both of the&s;e collectively taken!&mdash;I will only a&s;k the learned divines who compo&s;ed that a&s;&s;embly, on what logical principles this a&s;&s;ertion is founded; the plain mean|ing of which is preci&s;ely this; <Q REND="inline">"<HI>that the friendly or unfriendly nature of any opinions as to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hments of civil government, is to be judged of, not by the intrin&s;ic nature of the&s;e opinions, but by the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">re DECLARATION of the STATE it&s;elf; and that this declaration is to be admitted as a &s;uffi|cient PROOF or TEST, what&s;oever be the nature of the opinions them&s;elves.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P N="3"><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">3. That a compliance with the te&s;ts of conformity, which now &s;ub&s;i&s;t in this kingdom, is required from tho&s;e, who are employed by the &s;tate, as a pledge, or &s;ecurity, that they will not attempt any thing ho&s;tile to the e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution; that, under this view, &s;uch <HI>Te&s;ts</HI> are not puni&s;hments for an opinion, but <HI>re&s;traints to prevent an evil:</HI> not in&s;truments of oppre&s;&s;ion, but <HI>in&s;titutions to pre&s;erve the public peace.</HI> And we are &s;o far from con&s;idering them as <Q REND="inline">"<HI>grievances or common evils,</HI>"</Q> that we think our&s;elves warranted, from the experience of more than a century, to expre&s;s our de&s;ires, that they may be continued in force (or that &s;ome <HI>other equivalent obligations</HI> may be &s;ub&s;tituted in their place) as wi&s;e and ju&s;t provi&s;ions for the &s;afety of the &s;tate.</NOTE> III. Since therefore no &s;tate has a right to a te&s;t of <HI>opinions</HI> in any ca&s;e, it can have no right
<PB N="4" REF="4">
to a declaration of conformity to the church of England, as a qualification for offices. Con&s;e|quently, though &s;ome pledge or &s;ecurity may be ju&s;tly required that tho&s;e who are employed by the &s;tate, will not attempt any thing ho&s;tile to it, this pledge or &s;ecurity, mu&s;t be of a <HI>civil</HI> na|ture only, and can have no reference to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. Therefore religious te&s;ts of all kinds are unlawful. And whether they are intended as <HI>re&s;traints to prevent an evil,</HI> or in&s;titu|tions to <HI>pre&s;erve the public peace,</HI> they cannot have place in any civil view. Of con&s;equence, though they were even &s;uch as contained true and acknowledged principles only, and con&s;equently did not compel a &s;ingle per&s;on to declare a belief of what he was not already per&s;uaded of, they would, neverthele&s;s, be a grievance even on <HI>this</HI> &s;uppo&s;ition, as being the application of a &s;anction to which no &s;tate can plead a right in any ca&s;e whatever.</P>
<P>If it be urged, that the <HI>church</HI> al&s;o is concerned in this; and that this religious te&s;t has al&s;o a tendency to pre&s;erve the <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution;</HI> the right to &s;uch te&s;t in this re&s;pect, mu&s;t depend upon one or more of the&s;e principles;&mdash;that an exclu&s;ive religious e&s;tabli&s;hment is a right ari&s;ing from the nature of &s;ociety in general; or from the nature of a <HI>particular</HI> &s;ociety; or from the nature of the Briti&s;h government. But on the fir&s;t principles, &s;ince the rights of con|&s;cience are equal, religious opinions, as to their claims, mu&s;t be equal, and con&s;equently there cannot be a predominant e&s;tabli&s;hed church con&s;i&s;tently with the de&s;ign of &s;ociety, and the un|alienable rights of con&s;cience; nor can it ari&s;e from the nature of a particular &s;ociety; becau&s;e either every religious e&s;tabli&s;hment is a good one; or &s;ome one is better than all the others. The former of which &s;uppo&s;itions, as it totally de&s;troys the idea of the importance of religious truth, will be admitted by none, but tho&s;e who di&s;regard religion altogether: And the latter, though true, involves this que&s;tion; which (of all the religio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s in the world, that claim a right to e&s;ta|bli&s;hment), is the only true one, and the only one calculated to advance the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety and ju&s;t government?&mdash;When this que&s;tion is &s;atisfactorily an&s;wered, &s;o as to convince <HI>all mankind,</HI> (for le&s;s than this cannot e&s;tabli&s;h the right pleaded for) then the right of exclu&s;ive e&s;tabli&s;hments may po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve &s;ome attention.</P>
<P>This is preci&s;ely the ca&s;e as to the Church e&s;tabli&s;hment in England. Be&s;ides the obligation which lies upon its advocates to prove that its claims as an e&s;tabli&s;hment are not incompatible with the equal and unalienable rights of con&s;cience; it ought to be &s;hewn by them, that the nature of the Church it&s;elf is the be&s;t formed to pre&s;erve and &s;upport the &s;pirit of the Government, to e&s;tabli&s;h the rights of the people, and to promote tho&s;e principles of ju&s;tice, &s;obriety, and due &s;ubordination, without which no &s;ociety can exi&s;t or flouri&s;h. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">It may be al&s;o a que&s;tion of no &s;mall importance, on &s;uppo&s;ition that the Church of England is the be&s;t calculated to &s;upport the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, what are we to think of the Scotch eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment? Have two e&s;tabli&s;hments of a directly oppo&s;ite nature a tendency to produce the &s;ame effect? Or is it the nature of the Scotch e&s;tabli&s;hment to de&s;troy or impair the Briti&s;h con&s;titution?</NOTE></P>
<P>Now, without detracting from the merits of the Church in this re&s;pect; I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that all the&s;e principles are equally taught by every party of the Di&s;&s;enters al&s;o; and applied with at lea&s;t as much con&s;i&s;tence and force to the very &s;ame purpo&s;es. All the&s;e &s;ectaries, therefore, have an equal right to exclu&s;ive e&s;tabli&s;hent with the Church of England. But equal and con|tradictory rights are &s;elf de&s;tructive. Therefore none of them, not even the Church it&s;elf has a 
<PB N="5" REF="5">
right to an exclu&s;ive e&s;tabli&s;hment. If it be &s;aid, in reply to this, that their claims cannot be equal, becau&s;e the Members of the Church compo&s;e the majority of the nation; it is a point which calls for all the proof which the Clergy can produce, that the rights of con&s;cience in the majority of a nation are nece&s;&s;arily and ju&s;tly of &s;uch a kind, as to infer a dominion over the rights of con&s;cience in the re&s;t of the nation.</P>
<P>But the&s;e things the Di&s;&s;enters do not contend for. They are willing to contribute to the &s;up|port even of the mini&s;ters of a Church which they di&s;approve, provided they be not held up as bad &s;ubjects to the civil government in their principles or conduct. And this they certainly are, even on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the te&s;ts of conformity, with which they cannot con&s;cientiou&s;ly comply, are u&s;ed as <HI>re&s;traints only to prevent an evil</HI> apprehended from them, and in&s;titutions <HI>to pre|&s;erve the public peace,</HI> which, if they were admitted to civil offices, would be in danger of being di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>The principles of the Di&s;&s;enters, as far as they relate to civil government, are perfectly agree|able to the principles of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution: a con&s;titution which they have always &s;upported, and which indeed, in a great mea&s;ure, owes its pre&s;ent perfection to their &s;ervices: This is acknowledged by Mr. Hume him&s;elf, who though far from being friendly to the Di&s;&s;enters, bears this honourable te&s;timony to them, (Hi&s;t. v. 5. p. 189.) that <Q REND="inline">"<HI>the precious &s;park of liberty</HI> was kindled and pre&s;erved by the Puritans <HI>alone;</HI> and it was to this &s;ect (from whom the pre&s;ent Di&s;&s;enters derive their origin) that the Engli&s;h owe the <HI>whole freedom of their con&s;titution.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Their <HI>religious</HI> principles, at lea&s;t tho&s;e in which they <HI>all</HI> agree, are reducible to the&s;e: That as men and members of a religious community, all mankind have equal rights of con&s;cience; that per&s;ecution of every kind, even to the lowe&s;t degree of civil re&s;traint, on account of religious &s;entiments, is unju&s;t and unlawful; and that, therefore, as Chri&s;tians, all have an equal right to &s;tudy the Scriptures, and apply them as the only rule of faith and manners. And the&s;e are the only principles on which the &s;eparation of the Church of England from that of Rome, is, or can be vindicated.</P>
<P>When the friends of the Church can make it appear that the&s;e &s;entiments are dangerous to any well-governed State, and particularly to that of Great Britain, I will then acknowledge (how incon&s;i&s;tent &s;oever this may be with the principles ju&s;t laid down) that it is high time, not only to lay re&s;traint upon the profe&s;&s;ors of them, but totally to pro&s;cribe and bani&s;h them from the com|munity. But if, on the contrary, they are e&s;&s;ential to the well-being of every State, to lay the &s;malle&s;t re&s;traint on them is really a <HI>grievance,</HI> and indeed a <HI>common evil,</HI> &s;ince it operates as a di&s;couragement to the only foundations of good government and true religion; and ought, there|fore, on every principle on which the&s;e depend, to be ab&s;olutely and totally abrogated.</P>
<P N="4"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">4. That it is no valid objection to the&s;e TESTS, that they call in the <HI>&s;anctions of religion to purpo&s;es merely civil.</HI> To &s;ecure allegiance to lawful government, certainty to the payment of its taxes and tributes, and veracity to legal te&s;timony in its courts of judicature, are <HI>purpo&s;es merely civil;</HI> and yet they are ALL required and enforced under the <HI>religious &s;anction of an oath.</HI></NOTE> IV. It is certainly a completely valid objection, that the&s;e religious te&s;ts are made &s;ub&s;ervient to <HI>civil purpo&s;es.</HI> For this &s;uppo&s;es a right in the magi&s;trate to interfere in the regulation of the opinions on which the&s;e te&s;ts are founded; the contrary to which was proved under the 1&s;t. Article. And the argument which is drawn in favour of them from the religious nature of an <HI>oath,</HI> the application of which to civil purpo&s;es is admitted on all hands, is an argument drawn from what is totally <HI>di&s;&s;imilar,</HI> and inapplicable to the te&s;ts in que&s;tion. For from the &s;anction of
<PB N="6" REF="6">
an oath, the utmo&s;t which can be argued, is, that the per&s;on who takes it believes the truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In the ca&s;e of evidence in a court of ju&s;tice, not even this is required: but the witne&s;&s;es are &s;worn on the principles of <HI>that religion only which they admit</HI> as of divine authority.</NOTE> which does not conclude at all again&s;t the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> who univer&s;ally ad|mit the Chri&s;tian Religion;&mdash;but the te&s;ts with which an oath is here compared, imply the belief of a <HI>particular &s;et of principles, deduced by men</HI> only from this religion, and which, being liable to di&s;pute, cannot have an authority <HI>equal</HI> to that of the Go&s;pel it&s;elf. The admi&s;&s;ion, indeed, of the &s;anction of the former, as it implies divine authority in that from which it is derived, by no means <HI>infers,</HI> indeed it <HI>rejects</HI> the &s;anction of the latter, which is founded on human authority only. And it may be ju&s;tly inquired, why, when an oath is completely &s;ufficient to &s;ecure a due allegiance to civil government, any other &s;anction &s;hould be called for? And whether one, who is capable of breaking through obligations derived from a religion acknowledged by him to be divine, will not be likely to break through tho&s;e which ari&s;e from only one <HI>particular &s;y&s;tem</HI> of that religion; many of the principles of which &s;y&s;tem are, at be&s;t, of very dubious authority?</P>
<P>This proceeds on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the te&s;ts them&s;elves are unambiguous declarations of at|tachment to the Church which impo&s;es them; and therefore if the arguments again&s;t &s;uch te&s;ts are complete and conclu&s;ive, they mu&s;t be &s;till more &s;o again&s;t the <HI>&s;acramental</HI> te&s;t required in the Church of England, which is capable of, and naturally leads to prevarication and deceit in tho&s;e who &s;ubmit to it; and has been, and is perpetually applied to purpo&s;es the mo&s;t directly contrary to the very de&s;ign with which it was in&s;tituted. Before, therefore, the lea&s;t plea can be advanced in favour of &s;uch a te&s;t, it lies upon its advocates to &s;hew clearly, that the receiving of the Lord's Supper, for the purpo&s;e of taking up a commi&s;&s;ion in the army, a place in the cu&s;toms, the occupation of an exci&s;eman, or indeed any worldly and lucrative employment, is <HI>perfectly con&s;i&s;tent</HI> with the end for which Chri&s;t appointed it, which was the religious remembrance of his life, &s;uf|ferings and death?</P>

It is a &s;ufficient proof of the ab&s;urdity of the fifth re&s;olution, that it confounds together two totally contrary ideas, and makes that to be the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> which is the <HI>effect,</HI> and the <HI>effect</HI> to be the <HI>cau&s;e: Civil rights,</HI> in&s;tead of being the <HI>con&s;equence</HI> of the laws of &s;ociety, are in reality the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of the laws;&mdash;which are expre&s;sly appointed for their <HI>protection.</HI> They are, therefore, <HI>antecedent</HI> in their very nature to the&s;e laws. The enjoyment and peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of civil rights is indeed <HI>&s;ecured</HI> by the laws, but the rights them&s;elves &s;tand upon the original foundation of nature: and to talk of rights being <HI>conveyed</HI> by the laws, is not only to make the laws the <HI>creators</HI> of the&s;e rights, but to take it al&s;o for granted, that the laws of <HI>every community, as laws,</HI> mu&s;t be univer&s;ally founded on ju&s;tice&mdash;the ab&s;urdity of which is evident, not only from the applications which are made for the repeal of laws deemed oppre&s;&s;ive, but from the very acknowledgment that there are governments exi&s;ting which are &s;upported by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ju&s;t</HI> laws.</P>
<P>If, therefore, there are civil rights antecedent to law, there mu&s;t be <HI>natural claims to civil offi|ces;</HI> for the latter is included in the former.

As it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e this, the ju&s;tice of his claim is in this ca&s;e plainly e&s;tabli&s;hed: and con&s;equently (which is indeed the <HI>&s;ame thing</HI>) his natural right to civil offices is equally e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

I cannot, however, di&s;mi&s;s this article, without expre&s;&s;ing my utter a&s;toni&s;hment at a declara|tion of this &s;ort. That men have from nature <HI>no civil rights,</HI> but that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e depend merely on the laws and regulations which are made by Government, is a principle which tends &s;o directly to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the mo&s;t exorbitant <HI>tyranny</HI> on the &s;ide of the Governors, and the mo&s;t abject and <HI>Slavi&s;h pa&s;&s;ive obedience</HI> on that of &s;ubjects, as cannot be thought of without abhorrence and dete&s;tation.</P>

This re&s;olution con&s;i&s;ts &s;o much of palpable mi&s;repre&s;entation, that it &s;carcely de|&s;erves any thing better than a plain and po&s;itive denial. <HI>That the diffenters do not &s;uffer, or even alledge they &s;uffer any re&s;traint on their religious liberties,</HI> is with re&s;pect to the latter part of the a&s;&s;ertion particularly, &s;o glaringly fal&s;e, as even their pre&s;ent efforts for the repeal of acts which they account oppre&s;&s;ive on their religious liberties, are of them&s;elves &s;ufficient to &s;hew. Will the author of the&s;e re&s;olutions deny this, and &s;ay that civil re&s;traints merely on account of reli|gious &s;entiments are no re&s;traints on religious liberty? Is there any e&s;&s;ential difference between laying a man under fines and penalties on this account, and preventing him from obtaining the natural right of citizens? If the former is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> all mu&s;t allow, per&s;ecution in a <HI>high</HI> degree, is not the other per&s;ecution in a degree &s;omewhat <HI>lower?</HI> In &s;ome re&s;pects it may not be in a <HI>lower</HI> degree. For re&s;traint from civil offices may, to tho&s;e men who are peculiarly fitted for doing honour to them, be a means of preventing them from reaping the highe&s;t emolu|ments and advantages during their whole lives; whereas a fine is temporary, and may have an influence only for a moment.</P>
<P>In this view, therefore, the Di&s;&s;enters, in&s;tead of contending for power, are really contend|ing for the proper rights of human nature: and their efforts reflect honour upon them&s;elves, and have a tendency, and, it is to be hoped, will have an <HI>efficacy</HI> to produce the general li|berty and happine&s;s of the Society to which they belong.</P>
<P>But this is not the only re&s;traint they &s;uffer on their religious liberties. Though as men and Chri&s;tians, they have a right to vindicate their religious principles, and as Di&s;&s;enters, they cannot in vindicating them, avoid reflecting on tho&s;e tenets which differ from theirs; yet this very cir|cum&s;tance may be con&s;trued into a reviling and derogation of the Liturgy; in which ca&s;e, they are liable to the penalty of fines and perpetual impri&s;onment. This is an oppre&s;&s;ion on <HI>all</HI> Di&s;&s;enters without exception;&mdash;and in the ca&s;e of tho&s;e among them who cannot admit the doc|trine of the Trinity, (which is indeed a &s;tumbling-block to many of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t among the Epi&s;copalians them&s;elves) the puni&s;hment is no le&s;s than <HI>a total lo&s;s of legal rights,</HI> and <HI>three years impri&s;onment</HI> without bail. It is happy for Di&s;&s;enters that here&s;y is left unde|fined in the Engli&s;h law, el&s;e the puni&s;hment of this, which is the &s;ame with that which is annexed to the denial of the Trinity, would have hung like a dreadful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> over the heads of innocent Nonconformi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Let the Che&s;ter Clergy, after finding the&s;e to be facts, &s;ay, if they can, that the Diffenters <HI>&s;uffer no re&s;traint on their religious liberties.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8">
If this &s;tate of the ca&s;e be ju&s;t (and no one can deny it) would it not have been better, and indeed more con&s;i&s;tent with truth, to have a&s;cribed the pre&s;ent <HI>conte&s;t</HI> (as it is called) of the Di&s;&s;enters, to a rea&s;onable and laudable principle of recovering their natural rights, rather than to have &s;tigmatized it by the appellation of <HI>a conte&s;t for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the offices of the State?</HI> A conte&s;t it is (if you plea&s;e to u&s;e that name) and a conte&s;t for <HI>power</HI> in <HI>one</HI> &s;en&s;e. But it is a conte&s;t, like that at the Reformation, or at the Revolution, for the noble&s;t privileges of humanity; a conte&s;t which, whether &s;ucce&s;sful or not, will enroll their names among the glorious defenders of civil and religious liberty, and make them &s;hine with the brighte&s;t &s;plendour, to ages yet unborn.</P>
<P>I would not be improperly warm, even on the &s;ubject of religious liberty. I &s;hall therefore quit this topic, with only propo&s;ing to the Che&s;ter Clergy the&s;e queries:&mdash;<HI>Is a conte&s;t for civil offices unlawful in it&s;elf? Is a conte&s;t for civil rights unlawful in it&s;elf? Do not civil rights imply a right to civil offices?</HI> And if this conte&s;t is not in it&s;elf unlawful. I call upon them to tell the world in the mo&s;t plain and unambiguous manner, <HI>what is there in the prin|ciples, the conduct, or the character of the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, which does not render them in every re&s;pect capable of being employed in the executive</HI> (as they are already in the mo&s;t important branch, the legi&s;lative) <HI>department of a good, and well-regulated Government?</HI></P>
<P>After this, there is &s;carcely any nece&s;&s;ity to remark on the next pa&s;&s;age. <HI>Civil offices are tru&s;ts for the benefit of the State</HI>&mdash;So &s;ay the Di&s;&s;enters too; and I will add (as to all tho&s;e who conduct them&s;elves agreeably to the di&s;&s;enting principles) &s;o <HI>act</HI> they al&s;o. They, there|fore are among the be&s;t, if not actually the be&s;t &s;ubjects, in this free and well-governed State; and as &s;uch, have a corre&s;ponding right to its emoluments and offices. As, therefore, I agree perfectly with the Che&s;ter Clergy, <HI>that the&s;e emoluments and offices ought not to be entru&s;ted to tho&s;e who te&s;tify their di&s;affection to the State;</HI> the conclu&s;ion I draw is, that the Di&s;&s;enters, not only on account of their natural rights as men, but al&s;o on account both of their princi|ciples and conduct as citizens, have an equal right with all the other members of the State, to a proportional &s;hare in its offices, emoluments, and honours.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t clau&s;e of this re&s;olution, <HI>aver&s;ion to the e&s;tabli&s;hments of the State,</HI> is mentioned as a rea&s;on for excluding Di&s;&s;enters from civil offices. What is the meaning of this word E&s;ta|bli&s;hments? Is it <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed laws?</HI> If &s;o, an aver&s;ion to &s;ome of them is by no means a rea&s;on for excluding Di&s;&s;enters <HI>only,</HI> but <HI>all</HI> who wi&s;h for and endeavour after the abroga|tion of oppre&s;&s;ive &s;tatutes, are unfit for offices. But this idea is too ab&s;urd to be dwelt upon. Is it the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church of England? In truth Di&s;&s;enters give them&s;elves little trouble about it. Provided they can &s;ecure tho&s;e ju&s;t rights of a civil and religious nature which have been already &s;tated, they willingly leave the honours and emoluments of the Church to remain as they are.</P>
