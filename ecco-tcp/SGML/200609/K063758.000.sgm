<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following Treati&s;e having gain'd &s;o &V;niver&s;al an Ap|plau&s;e in her &s;everal Pieces, in mo&s;t Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that it would be judg'd &s;uperfluous, to enlarge our &s;elves in her Prai&s;e; I have only a few Words to add concerning the Hi&s;tory it &s;elf. The Reader will here meet with a mo&s;t agreeable Intermixture of Pa&s;&s;ions, which produc'd the mo&s;t &s;urprizing Events and Revolutions in this I&s;land, that can well be imagin'd, &s;o artificially and curiou&s;ly inter|woven within one another, that the whole In|tertexture repre&s;ents to you, Ambition, Cou|rage, Love and Con&s;tancy, in their mo&s;t exalted Vigour and Strength, and that upon &s;o exact a Level, that it is hard to judge (for &s;ome time) which is either the mo&s;t predominant or the mo&s;t likely to triumph over the re&s;t: At la&s;t, Love exerts her utmo&s;t Charms, and gives us undeniable Proofs of the ab&s;olute &s;way She bares even in the mo&s;t Memorable Actions of the Greate&s;t of Men, and the mo&s;t Stupendious Events in the World. You will here &s;ee King <HI>Ed|ward</HI> more than once venturing his Crown for
<PB REF="3">
the Love of Madam <HI>Grey,</HI> and upon the Point of lo&s;ing it for ever. You will &s;ee here, I &s;ay, the Great Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who had the Art of gaining of Crowns, forfeit them to his Love: As his Fall is an undeniable In&s;tance, that even in the Tran&s;actions of the highe&s;t Moment, the Pa&s;&s;ions of Princes have often a greater Share than the mo&s;t profound Rea&s;ons of State; &s;o it may &s;erve as a Warning to all Favourites, and make them reflect on the In&s;tability of their Greatne&s;s, which is built upon &s;o &s;lippery a Foundation. Two Great, tho' &V;nfortunate Heroes, are &s;uing for your Favour, in hopes, that &s;ince they have made &s;o glorious a Figure Abroad, we will not &s;uffer, to our Confu&s;ion, that their Memory &s;hould be le&s;&s;en'd among their own Po&s;terity. I had almo&s;t forgot to add, That &s;ince &s;ome of the <HI>Lady's Letters,</HI> found in her Cabinet, could not be in&s;erted in the <HI>Memoirs of the Engli&s;h Court,</HI> lea&s;t the Book &s;hould have &s;well'd to too great a Bulk, it was thought fit to annex them to this.</P>

<HEAD> MEMOIRS OF THE Earl of <HI>WARWICK.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HENRY</HI> of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> had reign'd peaceably near thirty years, when <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who&s;e Ance&s;tors were once in full Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Crown, re&s;olv'd to lay hold of that favourable Juncture which then offer'd it &s;elf, to a&s;&s;ert and maintain his Right, in conjunction with <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Marche,</HI> his Son, and <HI>Richard Ne|ville,</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> his mo&s;t intimate Friend. The&s;e having rai&s;ed a good number of Troops, and back'd by a &s;trong Party, made War upon King <HI>Henry.</HI> It &s;eem'd as if Fortune had pitch'd upon the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> to make it the Theater of its capricious Chance: After &s;everal Battles fought with different &s;ucce&s;s, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> being upon the point of giving another to his Rival, <HI>Andrew Tralop,</HI> an ancient brave Officer, in whom he much confided, unexpectedly went over
<PB N="2" REF="5">
with all his Forces to the King; &s;o that &s;eeing him|&s;elf thus weakned, he had no other way left than to retire as fa&s;t as he could. The Earls of <HI>la Marche</HI> and <HI>Warwick</HI> left him at that Conjuncture, the better to repair this &s;udden Di&s;appoint|ment, and having rais'd fre&s;h Troops, march'd towards <HI>London,</HI> where having all this while maintain'd a &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence, they were ad|mitted into that City, and the King oblig'd to &s;eek for &s;helter in the <HI>Tower. Margarete</HI> of <HI>Anjou</HI> his Queen, a Lady of an undaunted Courage, ha|ving, notwith&s;tanding this, found means to rai&s;e and put the King and her &s;elf at the Head of a formidable Army, they &s;ought for nothing more than to come to an Engagement: The two Earls being no le&s;s eager for fighting, they came to a Bat|tle near <HI>Northampton;</HI> Fortune declar'd for the Earls, and the unfortunate King <HI>Henry</HI> was taken Pri&s;o|ner.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this good Succe&s;s, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> finding matters not altogether to an&s;wer his Expectation, was willing to come to an Accom|modation with the captive King: But the Queen more re&s;olute, and le&s;s tractable than the King her Spou&s;e, and not able to brook a Submi&s;&s;ion &s;o little &s;uitable to her Courage and the high Rank &s;he bore in the World, po&s;itively refu&s;ed to come to <HI>London,</HI> looking upon the Orders &s;ent by the King as forced from him by his Enemies; but in|&s;tead thereof, leaving no &s;tone unturn'd to repair their Di&s;grace, at la&s;t &s;aw her &s;elf once more in a Condition to offer Battle to the Duke of <HI>York.</HI> This Prince de&s;pi&s;ing to be challeng'd by a Wo|man, a Bloody Battle was fought, wherein the Queen proving victorious, caus'd the Heads of the Duke, and the Earl of <HI>Rutland</HI> his Son, &s;lain in the Engagement, to be put over the Gates of the City of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">
From thence &s;he ha&s;tned to <HI>London,</HI> to &s;ee the King and deliver him of his Impri&s;onment; but receiving Intelligence that the Earls of <HI>La Marche</HI> and <HI>Warwick</HI> had carried him along with them, and were at the Head of a good Army, She En|gag'd them with the fir&s;t Opportunity, obtain'd the Victory, but enjoy'd not the Fruits thereof: For the Earl of <HI>La Marche</HI> getting to <HI>London</HI> before her, was there Proclaim'd King, under the Name of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. <HI>Henry</HI> and <HI>Margarete</HI> had no &s;ooner Notice of this unexpected News, but they a&s;&s;embled all their Troops, and <HI>Edward</HI> fully re|&s;olv'd not to &s;uffer them to approach <HI>London,</HI> march'd with all po&s;&s;ible Expedition, in Conjun|ction with the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> towards <HI>Tanton;</HI> There he gave Battle to <HI>Henry,</HI> which la&s;ted two days, and co&s;t the Lives of 36000 Men: Victory at la&s;t declar'd for <HI>Edward,</HI> who having now no more Enemies to encounter in the Field, began to reli&s;h the Sweets of an agreeable Tranquility, and took effectual Care to reward the Fidelity of his Friends.</P>
<P>He was a Prince endu'd with all the Qualities re|qui&s;ite to make him&s;elf belov'd; His high Birth and the Crown he wore, had a le&s;s &s;hare in the Re&s;pect and Love his Subjects bore him, than his goodly Air, and great Qualifications; He was very engaging, &s;prightly, of a &s;weet and tender di&s;po|&s;ition; He was a little too much addicted to Gallantry, &s;o that his various Pa&s;&s;ions have &s;ome|times been a Reproach to him: However his War|like Inclinations always had the better over his Love Pa&s;&s;ion; for he prefer'd Martial Exploits to all other Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;ie to be gue&s;s'd at, with what Demon|&s;trations of Joy this Victorious Prince was receiv'd at <HI>London;</HI> Among the re&s;t of his faithful Servants was General <HI>Talbot</HI> Earl of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">op;</HI> and this young
<PB N="4" REF="7">
Monarch, to reward his Services, and to &s;hew his Acknowledgment to all the World, be&s;tow'd not only va&s;t Riches upon him, but al&s;o honour'd him with his Confidence, which made that General to be highly care&s;s'd at Court.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> having at that time &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s of great Moment to tran&s;act at Court, &s;ought all po&s;&s;ible Means of gaining General <HI>Talbot</HI> to his Intere&s;t, which perhaps he would not have encompa&s;s'd at a very ea&s;ie rate, he being a Man of a blunt Conver&s;ation, who aim'd at no|thing more, than to have the Reputation of a faithful Servant to his King, and of a good Soldier: But happening one Day to divert him&s;elf with walking in a Garden near <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> and meeting accidentally with the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon|&s;hire,</HI> he was &s;urpriz'd, and quite dazled with her Beauty and Charms. As the Earl of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> her Father, had kept her very retir'd at his own Hou&s;e ever &s;ince &s;he had been married, for fear this growing young Beauty &s;hould produce &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter Effects at Court; &s;o nothing but an Accident could have given an Opportunity to the General of &s;ee|ing her.</P>
<P>The General's Mind equally divided betwixt Love and Re&s;pect, would not permit him to ac|co&s;t her; &s;o he contented him&s;elf with walking up and down in a certain Walk, from whence he could &s;ee her. Thus quite po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the <HI>Idea</HI> of this Charming Lady, he returns to <HI>London,</HI> and &s;o to Court. The King was then playing at Cards with &s;everal Ladies, attended by a great Number of Courtiers: But the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was got at &s;ome Di&s;tance from the re&s;t, in order to enter a certain <HI>Memorandum</HI> of Con&s;equence to him&s;elf, in his Table Book. I told you before, that the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s Name was <HI>Richard de Neville;</HI> but I did not tell you, that being bred
<PB N="5" REF="8">
up along with the King, this Prince lov'd him be|yond any of all his Favourites; and in effect, he had greater Obligations to him, than to any other of all his Friends. He was the Son of <HI>Richard de Neville</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> Lord Chancellor of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and <HI>Alice</HI> the only Daughter of <HI>Thomas Mon|tague,</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury.</HI> Tho' but young at that time, he was already a Widower, his decea&s;ed Lady being <HI>Anne,</HI> Si&s;ter to the Duke of <HI>Warwick.</HI> The Earl, who&s;e Hi&s;tory I am a going to give you, was a Per&s;on &s;o far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing in his Per&s;onal Me|rits, Courage and Genero&s;ity, all others at Court, that he acquir'd the Sirname of <HI>the Great.</HI> Never liv'd a Man in greater Affluence and Splendor, nor ever did any one things with a better Grace than he; He being &s;o far from endeavouring to heap up Riches, or to husband his E&s;tate, that he look'd upon Wealth as a thing not worth his Care: Notwith&s;tanding this Indifferency he was the Riche&s;t Lord in the Kingdom. He had a Genius &s;o far predominant above the common Rank of Men, that even tho&s;e who had a Preju|dice again&s;t him, and were ready at all Turns either to Contradict, or at lea&s;t not to Credit him, no &s;ooner heard him &s;peak, but like Inchant|ed Men, were compell'd to agree to what he pro|pos'd. He was both beautiful and finely &s;hap'd, even to a Miracle; His Magnificence and Gallan|try, which was natural to him, made him both Lovely and Dangerous. The King loving him both by Inclination and Gratitude, had made him not only his Confident, but al&s;o be&s;tow'd the Greate&s;t Places in the Kingdom upon him. It may ju&s;tly be &s;aid of him, That nothing could have bin above him, had he bin capable of apply|ing his whole Mind to Bu&s;ine&s;s: But his Inclina|tions for Love, and a certain Notion he had fram'd to him&s;elf, That even the highe&s;t Dignities
<PB N="6" REF="9">
are purchas'd at too dear a Rate, when upon that account we are forced to &s;acrifice the Plea&s;ures of our Life, made him &s;ometimes &s;top in that Car|reer wherein otherwi&s;e he might have carried e|very thing before him at Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This Character, upon which I have perhaps en|larg'd a little too much, has in&s;en&s;ibly drawn me away from General <HI>Talbot.</HI> He, after having look'd a little while upon the Game&s;ters, e&s;py|ing the Earl, drew nearer and told him, <HI>You are too Gallant a Per&s;on, for one to &s;uppo&s;e you &s;hould write any thing el&s;e, but &s;ome Ver&s;es or other to your Mi&s;tre&s;s; And how happy are you, My Lord, to be able to make them!</HI> The Earl looking upon him, &s;aid Smiling; <HI>What! Is this General</HI> Talbot? <HI>Has he got &s;ome Reli&s;h in the tender Effects produced by Poetry?</HI> He made no an&s;wer, but lifting up his Eyes towards Heaven, ob&s;erv'd in the Earls Coun|tenance all the marks of that Ironical and Malici|ous Air, which he was blam'd for by &s;ome. <HI>Alas!</HI> cry'd the General, <HI>I intended to make you my Confident; but you are not indulgent enough.</HI> The Word <HI>Con|fident,</HI> rais'd in the Earl an extream De&s;ire of be|ing admitted into the Secret, &s;ince by his Sighs and other pa&s;&s;ionate Motions, he was &s;en&s;ible there was a Love Intreague in the ca&s;e, and he cou'd not but be highly plea&s;ed to &s;ee &s;uch a Sa|vage Creature, to be taken in the Snare of a Young Beauty. <HI>Don't be di&s;may'd,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>at my Jocular way, I can be &s;erious upon Occa&s;ion; I gue&s;s in part at your Thoughts; You are in Love, and you may a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, you &s;hall find in me the only Man in the World, who is capable of giving you the be&s;t Advice. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> reply'd the Ge|neral, <HI>I &s;hould be in Love in &s;o &s;mall a time; 'tis not above three Hours &s;ince I &s;aw, and that for the fir&s;t time, the Per&s;on that makes me thus &s;igh; but my Lord,</HI> continued he, <HI>Oh! How Beautiful is &s;he!</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="10">
<HI>She has a noble Air, without Affectation; there was ne|ver a better Shape &s;een than Hers; her Complexion, the Colour of her Hair, her Features, to be &s;hort, every thing is charming in Her. I went to</HI> Hampton-Court, <HI>to pay a Vi&s;it to the Duke of</HI> Norfolk <HI>who has bin ill for &s;ome days; as I was taking a walk in a Garden, I &s;aw the Earl of</HI> Devon&s;hire <HI>and his Lady doing the &s;ame; he having de&s;ired me to &s;erve him in a Bu|&s;ine&s;s of his, again&s;t one of my Friends, I did all I cou'd to avoid meeting him, as &s;oon as I got &s;ight of them, and therefore turn'd off into a By-walk where I thought I was &s;ecure from being &s;een; but alas! within a few Minutes, I found him and the Counte&s;s &s;it|ting upon a Seat of Green Turfs; for it being then very hot, &s;he was &s;omewhat tired with walking: The Colour of her Cheeks re&s;embled two white Ro&s;es mix'd with an Incornation; her Eyes carry'd along with them &s;o bright a Lu&s;tre, that I never beheld any thing like it in all my Life; and to be &s;hort, my Lord, mu&s;t I tell you over and over again, that &s;he appear'd to me a mo&s;t ravi&s;hing Beauty. You &s;hall tell it me,</HI> reply'd the Earl, <HI>as of|ten as you think fit for your own Satisfaction; I am extreemly pleas'd to &s;ee you &s;o Pa&s;&s;ionate for a Hand&s;om Young Lady, and fancy I &s;hall &s;ee you before long work at your Needle, as</HI> Hercules <HI>did with</HI> Omphalis. <HI>Alas!</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I am at a great Di&s;tance to &s;ee her as my</HI> Om|phalis; <HI>you will &s;ee an unfortunate Lover, who is quite a Novice in the very Rudiments of that Art wherein you excel. Don't talk of Ignorance,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Earl, <HI>'tis enough for a Man to Love, to render him quickly capable of attaining to every thing required in Love; and will you make me believe, that you were never touch'd with any other Beauty before? No,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I knew not what Love was, I will declare it to you by all the mo&s;t direful Imprecations that can be.</HI> He was actually a going to call Heaven and Earth to Witne&s;s, when the Earl interrupting him, &s;aid, <HI>I believe you, my Lord, I believe you; I am con|vinc'd</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="11">
<HI>you never was in Love before: But pray let me know wherein I can &s;erve you. You can,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>in|&s;truct me in what I mu&s;t do to be belov'd; becau&s;e you under&s;tand it better then any other Man in the World. To do this, I &s;hould be acquainted with the Counte&s;s of</HI> Devon&s;hire, reply'd the Earl, <HI>I &s;hould conver&s;e with her, and be admitted into her &s;ecret Thoughts, if I &s;hould &s;erve you for a Guide; whereas now you put me into a Foreign Country, where I am igno|rant both of the Language and Manners of the Peo|ple; &s;o that as the Ca&s;e &s;tands, I can &s;carce advi&s;e you to any thing but what mu&s;t create new troubles to you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I had the &s;atisfaction,</HI> reply'd the General, <HI>of meeting with a very favourable Reception, her Husband as I told you &s;tanding in need of my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which I will give him to the utmo&s;t of my Power; but after all, to plea&s;e the Husband is not always an infallible Rule of plea&s;ing his Spou&s;e. After all,</HI> &s;aid the Earl, <HI>it is a fair &s;tep in your Way, and it often happens, that tho&s;e who plea&s;e the Lady don't plea&s;e the Husband; as on the other hand, all that plea&s;e the Husband don't always plea&s;e the Wife.</HI> He laugh'd very heartily at the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> and &s;aid he, <HI>&s;ince you give me &s;uch Encouragement, I am impatient to embark under the Conduct of &s;o great a Ma&s;ter. At the wor&s;t, What Hazard am I likely to run? The lo&s;s of a Liberty, of what I ought to be weary long ago. I know not,</HI> &s;aid the Earl, <HI>whether you are weary, but this I am a&s;&s;ured of, you ought to be a&s;ham'd of it.</HI></P>
<P>They were &s;o intent upon the matter, that they did not perceive the King had left off playing, who approaching nearer, and over-hearing the la&s;t Words; ask'd them, What it was the Gene|ral ought to be a&s;ham'd of? The Earl was a going to divert the King with telling the whole Story, but that the General tipping the wink upon him to conceal it, he told the King, <HI>That he was blaming</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="12">
<HI>the General on account of his Indifferency, and that he had made him an Offer, to exchange with him &s;ome part of his Sen&s;ibility, for the General's In&s;en&s;ibility.</HI> The King reply'd with a &s;mile, <HI>He was oblig'd to the Earl, &s;ince he lov'd the General &s;o well, as to be glad to &s;ee him engag'd in &s;ome Love Amu&s;ements.</HI></P>
<P>The De&s;cription the General had given of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> rai&s;ed in the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> an extream De&s;ire of being acquainted with her: He had indeed &s;een her before; but She being very young, &s;eldom appearing at Court, and he at that time engaged with another Per&s;on, her Charms had not made any impre&s;&s;ions upon him; it was no difficult matter for him to find out a plau&s;ible Pretence to make her a Vi&s;it: He pitch'd upon a Day when he knew the Earl to be abroad a Hunting; he pretended &s;ome certain Bu|&s;ine&s;s, and having contriv'd the matter accordingly, he &s;ent to know whether he might &s;peak with the Counte&s;s about &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s that concern'd her Lord:</P>
<P>She was then in a <HI>Grotto</HI> at the further End of her Garden, and the Sea&s;on being very hot; He found her re&s;ting upon a Seat of Green Turfs, in a Silk Night Gown of Ro&s;e Colour, with Silver Flowers; &s;he appear'd very negligent and pen&s;ive: The Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> her Mother &s;itting near her upon the &s;ame Seat. Notwith&s;tand|ing the Earl was &s;ufficiently prepared for &s;uch an Interview by the Prai&s;es and Tran&s;ports of General <HI>Talbot:</HI> This did not hinder him for reli&s;hing that Exce&s;s of Plea&s;ure, which is com|monly occa&s;ion'd by a Surprize of this nature: His Eyes and Heart both agreeing in this point, <HI>That nothing in the World was Comparable for Beauty to Madam</HI> Devon&s;hire; And in &s;pite of all his Na|tural Boldne&s;s, for which the Earl was reprehend|ed by &s;ome, and all his Contrivance to give a Spe|cious
<PB N="10" REF="13">
Pretence for this Vi&s;it, he &s;tood &s;o amazed, that, without being able to utter one Word, he did nothing but make his Bows to the Ladies, con&s;idering all this while what to &s;ay, without being able to find out where to begin.</P>
<P>Another thing that puzled him, was to find out a Place were to &s;eat him&s;elf: The Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> would have engag'd him to &s;it down next to her; but judging he &s;hould not there have a full Sight of her fair Daughter, he &s;et him&s;elf down upon a large Marble kind of Ba&s;on, which &s;erved for a Receiver of Water from another Ve&s;&s;el placed above it; here having taken his Seat, without reflecting upon what might happen, he began to enter upon Compliments, or to &s;peak truly, upon &s;uch extravagant bomba&s;t &s;tuff, that the Ladies did not know what to make of it: However he went on in the &s;ame road, till on a &s;udden finding him&s;elf cold and wet almo&s;t all over, he &s;tood altogether &s;urpriz'd at this new Adventure.

<PB N="22" REF="25">
what I had further to do, to in&s;inuate my &s;elf in|to her Favour.'</P>
<P>'I did ri&s;e before the Sun, to the Surprize of the whole Court, and was abroad &s;o early, that the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> came too late: However, he made ha&s;te to find me out, and met with a kind Reception from me: Under Pretence of talking of his Seat, I took the Opportunity to enquire after his Lady; She was, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> the Occa&s;ion of my not being &s;ooner with your Maje&s;ty, &s;he is gone to <HI>London:</HI> I knew not whe|ther he took Notice of my Countenance, but, I am &s;ure it changed mo&s;t &s;trangely; however, <HI>he told me,</HI> that the Earl of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> being ill when &s;he came away from thence, was now very de|&s;irous to have her near him becau&s;e, as he took Delight in nothing, &s;o he hop'd her Conver&s;ation might divert him. I recover'd a little, when I under&s;tood the Occa&s;ion of her journey, which cau&s;ed me &s;o much Vexation; But after having follow'd the Chace for a little while, I clap'd Spurs to my Hor&s;e, and taking a By-road, &s;oon found my &s;elf alone. I alighted, and placing my &s;elf under the agreeable Shade of &s;ome Trees, gave my &s;elf an entire Liberty of employing all my Thoughts upon the Counte&s;s; What Plea|&s;ures, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> did not I promi&s;e to my &s;elf? And mu&s;t one Moment rob me of what I love? I have taken no Care, either how to &s;ee her again, or how to write to her; And mu&s;t I thus be &s;epara|ted from her? I ought rather to have fain'd my &s;elf Sick, to get an Opportunity of &s;taying with her, or ought to bring her back to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> under any Pretence whatever. Ala&s;s! What am I the bet|ter for my Soveraign Authority, if I dare not make u&s;e of it? I was then taking &s;ome Re&s;o|lutions, what to do for the future; but the&s;e were &s;oon gone, when I con&s;idered they might
<PB N="23" REF="26">
be di&s;plea&s;ing to her. Thus, whil&s;t I was &s;trug|ling betwixt my De&s;ires and Fear, I &s;aw my &s;elf fluctuating upon the Boi&s;trous Waves of a Sea that is never without Storms; all this while bewailing the Departure of my charming Coun|te&s;s: 'Twas ju&s;t then, I heard the Noi&s;e of &s;e|veral Hor&s;es, and the Voices of Women; I &s;hould have had but little Curio&s;ity to look after them, but that coming &s;o near me, I aro&s;e to avoid them; the fir&s;t thing that offered it &s;elf to my Sight, was my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire;</HI> At that ve|ry Moment, I felt all the Plea&s;ure of an agreea|ble Surpri&s;e; I run towards her, and without asking whether &s;he would alight, nay, without knowing what I propo&s;ed to do, I took her in my Arms and &s;et her upon the Ground; But in a Moment after, reflecting upon what I had done, I began to be unea&s;ie; However, it being too late to be recall'd, I ask'd her Pardon, con|juring her at the &s;ame time, to let me know, what unfore&s;een good Chance had brought her back; <HI>She told me,</HI> That the Axle-tree of her Cha|riot being broken by the Badne&s;s of the Road, which required a day's time to be mended, &s;he had re&s;olved to return from whence &s;he came. <HI>I then told her,</HI> What a condition her Departure had put me into, and that I had not left my Company upon any other account than to give my &s;elf over to my &s;ecret Thoughts, and to bewail my &s;elf for having pa&s;s'd a Day without &s;eeing her. She &s;eem'd to be touch'd with a thing which &s;he could not very well doubt of, &s;eeing me in this Solitary Place, where I could not be inform'd of the Mi&s;chance that had hap|pen'd to her Chariot, nor propo&s;e to meet with her at that time.'</P>
<P>'Among the Women that were along with her, I took Notice of <HI>Albine,</HI> whereof I had had &s;o lively
<PB N="24" REF="27">
a De&s;cription, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to mi&s;take her. I had a great Inclination to have &s;ecured her into my Intere&s;t at that In&s;tant; But Great People Labour under this Misfortune, That they can do nothing without being ob|&s;erved: 'Twas al&s;o for this Rea&s;on, that I would not detain the Counte&s;s &s;o long as I could have wi&s;h'd. I told her all that can be &s;aid or call'd <HI>Tender;</HI> But could not di&s;cover in her any other Di&s;po&s;ition, than what I ob&s;erv'd the day before; &s;o I was forced to hope for &s;ome happy Moment to &s;ee her in <HI>London.</HI> In the mean while, my Eyes follow'd her as far as they could; I &s;ent a thou&s;and Sighs after her, and then return'd where the Noi&s;e of the Hounds call'd me.'</P>
<P>'The Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> being ignorant of what Mi&s;chance had befaln his Lady's Equipage, I told it him, and that I had met her upon the Road, thinking that it might prove of wor&s;e Con&s;equence to make a My&s;tery of it, than to tell it as real|ly it was; But I found my &s;elf in the wrong, the Earl acting here the part of a jealous Husband, imputed to our own Contrivance the breaking of the Chariot, and our meeting in the Forre&s;t, and without reflecting that we could not gue&s;s the illne&s;s of the Earl of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> which they knew nothing of, till after I left them, he re|&s;olved to remove her at a good Di&s;tance from Court. I did not gue&s;s at his Intention, and &s;oon put an end to the Chace. He had no &s;ooner taken his Leave from me, but he ordered every thing to be got ready, and unwilling to confide in any body but him&s;elf, carry'd her away at Mid|night; &s;o that the poor Lady &s;aw her &s;elf ex|po&s;ed to tho&s;e Reproaches &s;he de&s;erved not.'</P>
<P>'So &s;oon as I got notice thereof, I return'd to Court, and the Old <HI>Albine,</HI> who had e&s;pou&s;ed
<PB N="25" REF="28">
my Intere&s;t, told me, the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> had de&s;ired my Lady <HI>Angle&s;y,</HI> to ob&s;erve her Daughter more narrowly for the future; That we had had an Interview, and that doubtle&s;s &s;he had an&s;wer'd my Purpo&s;e. This News pierced me to the very Heart, I writ to her, &s;he &s;ent me no An&s;wer, except that &s;he pray'd me with all po&s;&s;ible Violence, to &s;acrifice my Impatience to her Honour. Judge you <HI>(continued the King)</HI> to what a Degree I love her, &s;ince till now I have kept this a Secret from you. I hear News from her every Day, and I &s;hall certainly &s;peak with her the fir&s;t favourable Opportunity that offers. 'Twas <HI>Albine</HI> that told me concerning the Vi&s;it you made her, and that your appearing &s;o much di&s;compo&s;ed, had rais'd in them a Su&s;pition you were &s;ent by me, which would prove as un|&s;ea&s;onable to me as to you: Take my Word for it, I will have neither Confident, nor Rival, love &s;omewhere el&s;e, and never vi&s;it my Counte&s;s again.'</P> </Q></P>
<P><HI>I have nothing to &s;acrifice,</HI> reply'd the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who by this time having had &s;ufficient Lei&s;ure to recollect him&s;elf, and to con&s;ider of what he was to an&s;wer, told him: <HI>Sir, were the Young Counte&s;s as Beautiful in my Eyes as &s;he appears to yours, I would certainly never think of her any more as long as I live, even if it &s;hould co&s;t me my Life: But 'tis not I that am &s;ubject to this Fatality, 'tis General</HI> Talbot; <HI>'tis true, Sir, he loves my Lady</HI> Devon&s;hire <HI>with &s;o exce&s;&s;ive a Pa&s;&s;ion, that whereever he finds you to &s;tand in his way, he will not be able to out-live his Pain. I can't imagine what you tell me to be true,</HI> an&s;wer'd the King, <HI>Who has told you the General is in Love? He who never was &s;o before in his Life, a Per&s;on the mo&s;t cautious and indifferent of all Men living? 'Tis a Secret he entru&s;ted to me one Day, when your Maje&s;ty drew unexpectedly near us,</HI> &s;aid the
<PB N="26" REF="29">
Earl, <HI>and I intended to have given your Maje&s;ty the Diver&s;ion of under&s;tanding it at that time, but that the General making a &s;ign of keeping the Secret, I began to talk concerning his Indifferency, in&s;tead of his Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>The King return'd no An&s;wer, his Heart being divided betwixt Love and Genero&s;ity. He lov'd the General out of Gratitude, but the charming Counte&s;s by Inclination; &s;uch was his Confu&s;ion, that to conceal it in &s;ome mea&s;ure from the Earl, who&s;e over Curio&s;ity he not much lik'd, he left the Clo&s;et, and went into the Dutche&s;s of <HI>York</HI> his Mother's Apartment.</P>
<P>The Earl came home overwhelm'd with a mo&s;t profound Melancholy: Never did a Man pa&s;s a Night with more Anxiety and Trouble. <HI>Cea&s;e, Cea&s;e, &V;nfortunate Man,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to adore an inac|ce&s;&s;ible Beauty: She is belov'd by thy Ma&s;ter, who notwith&s;tanding all his Greatne&s;s and Addre&s;&s;es, has not as yet the lea&s;t certainty of being beloved; and what then mu&s;t be thy De&s;tiny, if thou per&s;i&s;ts in &s;o fatal a Pa&s;&s;ion! 'Tis time to abandon it, and to look upon this lovely Per&s;on as a dangerous Rock, which will &s;tave thy Ve&s;&s;el to Pieces.</HI> He had &s;carce taken this Re&s;olution, when retracting them as Frailties un|becoming his Courage, and little &s;uitable to that happy Temerity, which had &s;o often &s;tood him in good &s;tead. <HI>Is my Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o weak,</HI> continued he, <HI>as to give way with &s;o much ea&s;e to the Torrent that oppo&s;es its Progre&s;s? Have not I taken notice of &s;ome favourable Looks in the Counte&s;&s;es Eyes? I have no more to do than to per&s;uade the King, That if he con|tinues to be a Rival to the General</HI> Talbot, <HI>he will certainly die for Grief; and at the &s;ame time to make Mrs.</HI> Elizabeth Lucy <HI>&s;en&s;ible of the Infidelity of our Monarch, that &s;he may endeavour to reclaim him.</HI></P>
<P>This was a Lady of Quality, who&s;e Family had bin Famous for being employ'd in the greate&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="30">
Places of the Kingdom. In the Year 1173. <HI>Richard de Lucy,</HI> Lord Ju&s;tice of <HI>England,</HI> was General of the King's Armies, during the Civil Wars; and ever &s;ince that time, this Family be|ing in&s;eparably united to the Hou&s;e of <HI>York,</HI> they were often out of Favour; Upon the Acce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Edward</HI> to the Throne, they &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves in their Affection for his Service. This was the rea&s;on why all his Favourites, but e&s;pecially the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> ca&s;t their Eyes upon Mrs. <HI>Eliza|beth Lucy,</HI> to make her the King's Mi&s;tre&s;s; which they did without much Difficulty. This young Monarch, as I told you before, was the mo&s;t Gal|lant Prince of his Age, the be&s;t &s;hap'd, the brave&s;t and mo&s;t witty of all Men living. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> on the other hand, was con&s;idered as a Miracle of Beauty, nothing was comparable to her Shape, and her Wit alone was &s;ufficient to have &s;et off her Charms, had they bin much inferior to hers: 'Tis true, &s;he had a great Share of Pride and Haughtine&s;s; She look'd upon it as her Due, to choo&s;e her Adorers out of the Royal Family, and that, without doing her a great piece of Inju&s;tice, they could not wear any other Fetters but hers. The King, not able to refu&s;e her his Heart, at fir&s;t vi&s;ited her with much Circum&s;pection on account of her Reputation; but it was a hard matter, con|&s;idering the Ambition of the Lady, and the Love of her Gallant, to conceal a Secret of this Na|ture for any con&s;iderable time; in &s;hort, &s;he was for having it out. The King created her a Marchionne&s;s of <HI>Here&s;ord,</HI> which new Title, as it procured her a great Court, &s;o it occa&s;ion'd no le&s;s Envy in others. As now the King gave him|&s;elf an entire Liberty of &s;hewing his Gallantry and Pa&s;&s;ion to her, &s;o it was &s;oon divulged every where; and 'tis po&s;&s;ible, that this manner of loving &s;o publickly, took away the nice&s;t and &s;weete&s;t part of its Reli&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="31">
But whatever it were, he was mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately in love with the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and had a mo&s;t tender Concern for General <HI>Talbot,</HI> when he under&s;tood his Pa&s;&s;ion for her: He was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly touch'd, that it &s;hou'd be He who was likely to cau&s;e him &s;o much Pain; and &s;uch was his Genero&s;ity, that he would have &s;acrificed his Pa&s;&s;ion to him, had it not bin beyond his Power &s;o to do: He check'd his Inclinations, and was vex'd that his Heart would not join with his Rea|&s;on in his Cure. To allay in &s;ome mea&s;ure his Pain, he flattred him&s;elf, that the Earl of <HI>War|wick,</HI> whom he knew to be a bold and dextrous Per&s;on, perhaps made u&s;e of the General in&s;tead of a Shield, wherewith to &s;helter him&s;elf: <HI>For,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>there is but little Rea&s;on to imagine, that a Soldier, who never had any Inclinations to Gallantry, &s;hould now enter upon &s;o mad a Project, and that to &s;o little purpo&s;e. Ought he not to con&s;ider, that he is not Ma&s;ter of any thing, that may flatter him, ever to be able to plea&s;e the Counte&s;s of</HI> Devon&s;hire? <HI>She is one of the greate&s;t Ladys in the Kingdom, both for E&s;tate and Birth, nothing is comparable to her Wit and Beauty; &s;he is more narrowly watch'd than the</HI> Golden Fleece; <HI>What is it then that can make him promi&s;e to him&s;elf &s;uch a Conque&s;t? 'Tis true, he is a well made Per&s;on, but he is none of the younge&s;t; Oh! Doubt|le&s;s 'tis</HI> Warwick <HI>him&s;elf that is the real Lover, who thus thinks to put the change upon me.</HI> This Notion afforded him &s;ome pre&s;ent Con&s;olation; but to be &s;ecure of the Matter, he re&s;olv'd to try all Means of diving into the General's Sentiments.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> having, by this young Monarch's la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e to him, under&s;tood that one of my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>'s Women was not of a very difficult Acce&s;s, he judged he might engage her in his Intere&s;t, by giving her greater Pre&s;ents than the King had done, looking upon this as the

mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Point for his Repo&s;e, in hopes to interrupt the Corre&s;pondence by Letters, be|twixt his Ma&s;ter and the Counte&s;s, and in lieu thereof, to &s;ettle his own with her. He took al&s;o a full Re&s;olution not to mention one Word to the General of what he knew, for Fear he &s;hould re|&s;ign every thing to the King's Pa&s;&s;ion, a piece of Genero&s;ity he look'd upon as not very &s;uitable to his pre&s;ent De&s;ign. He went early to wait on the King, and &s;pent the re&s;t of the Day in the Apartment of the Marchione&s;s of <HI>Hereford;</HI> but could not meet with an Opportunity to tell her, &s;he had a mo&s;t dangerous Rival, as it was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;et her to work, to prevent the King's engaging any further in this new Pa&s;&s;ion, and being uncertain when he might have a favour|able time to entertain her, he ventur'd to write to her the&s;e Lines.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has not bin my Fault, that I am not now in a Condition to &s;ave you the Trouble of knowing, that the King is unfaithful: I have bin &s;o bold as to repre&s;ent to him, what Re|gard he ought to have to his Oaths, and how much he was in the wrong, to prefer the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> to you, &s;ince her Charms are &s;o much inferiour to yours.

<P><HI>Elizabeth de Lucy</HI> had bin &s;en&s;ible her &s;elf, that the King had not the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion for her; but his Intreague with the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> had bin carry'd on with &s;o much Secre&s;y, that in &s;pite of all her Endeavours, &s;he had not bin able to learn any thing of it. This Letter of the Earl of <HI>War|wick</HI>'s, all at once unravel'd tho&s;e Points which had occa&s;ion'd to her of late a thou&s;and Torments, tho' in effect, her Ca&s;e was not much amended by it: Being naturally of a fierce Temper, &s;he had much-a-do to choo&s;e the milder Way; But as &s;he had never as yet had any Conte&s;t with the King, &s;o &s;he, like a cunning Woman, rightly judged it more proper for her to try the King's Temper, before &s;he di&s;cover'd her own; &s;o &s;he retired into her Clo&s;et, for Fear of di&s;covering her Sentiments to tho&s;e that were then making their Court to her.</P>
<P>As for the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> he had had &s;o little Re&s;t, that, being &s;eized with a violent Pain in the Head, he was not able to ri&s;e; and therefore gave Orders that he would &s;ee no Body. Soon after, in comes the General <HI>Talbot,</HI> and his Servants belie|ving that a Per&s;on of his Character was excepted from their Ma&s;ters Orders, they let him go in. The General appear'd to be beyond his Wits at the Earl's Indi&s;po&s;ition, which perhaps at another Juncture he would not have bin; but now look'd upon him as his faithful Guide, who was to con|duct him through a Country where he, as yet, was unacquainted with the Roads. Since that time I &s;aw you la&s;t, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I have met with a world of Adventures, and you will be perhaps &s;ur|pris'd as well as my &s;elf, how dextrou&s;ly I got over them: I never thought Love cou'd have made me

&s;o Cunning and De&s;igning, and yet you will be o|blig'd to own, that it has. Go on, my Lord, as long as you think fit, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> I can much better hear than an&s;wer you.</P>
<P>As I was la&s;t Night making my Court to the King, <HI>&s;aid the General,</HI> I found him bu&s;y in look|ing upon &s;ome Pictures painted upon Gla&s;s: He call'd me as &s;oon as he &s;aw me; Have you any Skill, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> in this kind of Workman&s;hip? I drew nearer and told him, that the Light of the Candles was not very proper to make one &s;ee the true Perfections or Defects of the Painting; The&s;e are only Copies, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> &s;o there can be no great Lo&s;s in them; but among all the re&s;t, I have a peculiar Fancy for this, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> &s;hewing me the Picture of my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire:</HI> The Seller knows not who&s;e it is, without he goes to the <HI>Italian</HI> Painter to enquire, for whom he &s;ells them. I have too lively an <HI>Idea</HI> of that lovely Per&s;on, <HI>continued the General,</HI> not to know the Picture, which ca&s;t me into &s;uch a Confu&s;ion, that I could &s;carce recover my &s;elf; the King's Curio&s;ity made me tremble, &s;o I was very careful not to name her, and told him, doubtle&s;s it was &s;ome Foreigner. Why? <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> Would you not have her to be an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lady? It &s;eems to me, <HI>added I,</HI> that &s;he being &s;o exceeding hand&s;ome, &s;he mu&s;t have appear'd &s;omewhere or other. I a&s;&s;ure you, <HI>continued he,</HI> I have &s;ome confu&s;ed Remembrance to have &s;een her &s;omewhere or other. Perhaps in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Holland, &s;aid I;</HI> but for the mo&s;t part, Picture-drawers draw their Pictures according to their own Fancies, &s;uch as bare &s;ome Re&s;em|blance to every Body. The King made no An|&s;wer, but fixing his Eyes upon the Picture, &s;eem'd to be in a deep &s;tudy, and &s;o was I. How unfortunate am I! (<HI>&s;aid I</HI>) if I &s;hould have

&s;uch a Rival! A King &s;o lovely in his Per&s;on, is more likely to be accepted of than I; Is it po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould &s;o &s;oon leave his Mi&s;tre&s;s!</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> did within him&s;elf admire the Oddne&s;s of this Adventure, how General <HI>Talbot</HI> &s;hould ju&s;t come to the King, when this Pourtraiture of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> was brought to him. He could not immediately &s;atis|fy him&s;elf, what made the King pretend he did not know her; &s;ince &s;ome of tho&s;e that attend|ed his Per&s;on at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> knew he had bin treated with a Collation at her Hou&s;e. But he concluded at la&s;t, that the General knowing no|thing of that Matter, the King did it to be &s;ati&s;|fy'd concerning what he had told him of that General's Pa&s;&s;ion. Whil&s;t he was ruminating up|on all the&s;e Matters, the General being amazed to &s;ee him &s;o &s;urprized, What is the matter my Lord, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> Won't you &s;peak to me? I told you before, <HI>reply'd the Earl,</HI> I was not fit for Company. I am &s;atisfy'd, <HI>added the General,</HI> provided you will tell me only, what makes you to be &s;o much &s;urprized at what I tell you? The rea&s;on is, <HI>reply'd the Earl,</HI> (<HI>having recover'd him&s;elf a little</HI>) becau&s;e it &s;eems very odd to me, how any one cou'd offer the Picture of the Counte&s;s to &s;ale, &s;ince, con&s;idering how narrow|ly &s;he is ob&s;erv'd, I mo&s;t que&s;tion whether they would &s;uffer her Picture to be drawn. Be that as it will, <HI>an&s;wer'd he,</HI> the King bought the Pour|traiture, and charg'd me to carry it into his little Clo&s;et, where he intended to keep it, like a Jewel of great Value: Had he taken the lea&s;t notice of my Countenance, he might ea&s;ily have di&s;cover'd the Di&s;order I was in. As I heard him give his orders to bring the Limner who had made that Piece to him, I did not que&s;tion, but that he intended to enquire after the Name

There needed no more to make me ri&s;e early in the Morning; I went to the Picture-drawer, and having gain'd him into my In|tere&s;t by a very large Pre&s;ent (and bought the Ori|ginal, whereof the King has only the Copy) to tell his Maje&s;ty, That this Piece was drawn for the Fair <HI>Ro&s;amond,</HI> the Daughter of the Earl of <HI>Clifford,</HI> the Famous Mi&s;tre&s;s of King <HI>Henry</HI> II. of <HI>England;</HI> and that, tho' the Drapery was &s;ome|what too Modern for tho&s;e Times, he &s;hould tell him, He thought fit to dre&s;s her according to the Mode, that it might &s;ell the better. To be &s;hort, by the help of my In&s;tructions, he an|&s;wer'd all the young Monarch's Que&s;tions to a Miracle, whereof I was a Witne&s;s, with an In|tention to help him out upon occa&s;ion. The King would tell me &s;everal times, Truly <HI>Ro&s;amond</HI> was a lovely Lady, I don't wonder that King <HI>Henry</HI> would never forgive his Wife the Murder of &s;o Charming a Creature. Queen <HI>Eleonore,</HI> reply'd I, look'd upon her with a Jealous Eye; Yes, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> But as for my &s;elf I admire her; &s;ee what Difference there is betwixt our Sentiments. I made &s;carce any An&s;wer to this, being afraid, le&s;t, if I &s;hou'd put <HI>Ro&s;amond</HI> too far in his Head, he might thereby find out the way to the Beautiful Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire;</HI> &s;o I endeavour'd to divert him from the&s;e Thoughts, by propo&s;ing a Match at Tennis betwixt him and the Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter.</HI> My only Comfort is, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> That he thinks no further than <HI>Ro&s;amond,</HI> and that the Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;y,</HI> who is very &s;en&s;ible of her Daughter's Beauty, and what Impre&s;&s;ion it might make upon a young Prince, &s;o much inclined to Tenderne&s;s, does keep her up very clo&s;e, without &s;uffering her to come to Court, and that upon that Score &s;he makes all the World believe &s;he is mo&s;t frequently indi&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="37">
But, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> as for my own Concern, I know how to manage the Matter, and intend to enter into a &s;trict Friend&s;hip with the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI> I told you before, that he &s;tands in need of my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in a Bu&s;ine&s;s of great Con|&s;equence; wherein if I &s;hould oppo&s;e, I might turn the Ballance on which &s;ide I plea&s;e. 'Tis this that has made him entertain me with all ima|ginable Civilities, and when I went to vi&s;it him, he entreated me to vi&s;it his Lady in her Apart|ment. I mu&s;t confe&s;s to you, That her Charming Wit accompli&s;h'd what the Charms of her Per&s;on had begun before: I was &s;o far beyond my &s;elf, and &s;o bewitch'd, that nothing le&s;s than her Husband's Pre&s;ence, could have hinder'd me from declaring my Love upon the Spot: However, I check'd my Sighs, but with &s;o much Violence, that I was in Danger of being choak'd: Certainly never did a Man of my Age undergo &s;o hard a Novitiat. Alas! I am no more &s;urpriz'd now, that Love &s;hould even exert its Vigour among the Tygers and Bears: You may judge now, if I &s;hould be condemned to a much longer Silence, whether I would not immediately prefer Death to Life; and at the &s;ame time, it is no ea&s;ie Task for me to get an Opportunity of &s;peak|ing to her, unle&s;s you will do me the Favour to go along with me, and entertain the Earl, whil&s;t I do the &s;ame to the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>This offer was too plea&s;ing to the Earl of <HI>War|wick</HI> to refu&s;e it; for he had made &s;everal Trials of &s;eeing her again, and went at divers times to pay her a Vi&s;it, but my Lady <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> who was an Experienc'd Over&s;eer, had taken &s;uch mea&s;ures, that &s;etting a&s;ide his fir&s;t Vi&s;it, when, to &s;peak the Truth, &s;he &s;urpriz'd them, &s;he had always &s;ome Excu&s;e or other at hand to &s;end him away hand|&s;omely; &s;o that when the General, who had got
<PB N="35" REF="38">
a great A&s;cendant in that Family, de&s;ired him to go along with him, he was highly pleas'd with it. The Per&s;on he was to act, in amu&s;ing the Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> was indeed not altogether &s;uitable to his Wi&s;h; but he would certainly have gone under much wor&s;e Conditions, flattering him&s;elf, that at lea&s;t he might by Intervals &s;ay &s;omthing or other that would abundantly recompence his Labour.</P>
<P>The General took him in his Coach, becau&s;e the Earl's Livery &s;hould make no &s;hew at the Door, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on they took none of their Servants along with them; &s;o that coming to the Gate, my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> thought &s;he &s;hould &s;ee no body but the General, and tho' my Lord was then abroad, her Mother and &s;he look|ing upon him as no dangerous Per&s;on, admitted him without any further Ceremony. The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was too nearly concern'd, not to take particular notice in what manner his Reception &s;hould be made; he found them nettled at his Pre&s;ence, they both &s;hew'd him a great deal of Civility, but the young Counte&s;s would &s;carce lift up her Eyes to look upon him; and if &s;he hap|ned to look at her Mother, &s;he ca&s;t down imme|diately her Eyes again towards the Ground and chang'd Colour. There is not the lea&s;t que&s;tion, but that the Sprightline&s;s &s;he &s;hewed in his fir&s;t Vi&s;it, being not approved of by my Lady <HI>Angle|&s;ey,</HI> &s;he had given her perhaps a Le&s;&s;on upon that Account, which proved not very favourable on his &s;ide, &s;o that he found him&s;elf under no &s;mall Unea&s;ine&s;s; but the Plea&s;ure he felt of behold|ing &s;o Lovely and &s;o Extraordinary a Per&s;on, &s;oon got the better of that Veneration which was occa&s;ion'd by the &s;erious Looks of the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="39">
The General <HI>Talbot</HI> was not a little vex'd al&s;o to meet with my Lady <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> in her Daughter's Apartment; but re&s;olving to make the be&s;t how|ever of the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>'s Ab&s;ence, he told them at his fir&s;t coming into the Room, That he was come to entertain them with an Affair of Moment, and being placed next to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> he judged he could do no le&s;s than enter upon &s;omething that might Divert, and make &s;ome favourable Impre&s;&s;ion upon them. The main Subject of his Di&s;cour&s;e was &s;uch as he lov'd to &s;peak of mo&s;t: As for In&s;tance, The Famous Siege of <HI>Orleans,</HI> wherein he was &s;o much concern'd in conjunction with the Earl of <HI>Salis|bury,</HI> where the Maid of <HI>Orleans</HI> began to &s;ig|nalize her &s;elf in &s;o miraculous a manner; as al&s;o in the Battel of <HI>Patay,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>Suffolk</HI> lo&s;t the Day: The General did here Wonders, and they were both taken Pri&s;oners by this Heroine. Neither did the General forget to enlarge upon the taking of <HI>Roan</HI> by the Count <HI>de Dunois;</HI> for it was he, who, together with the Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> did mo&s;t bravely defend that Place, and who was deliver'd up as an Ho&s;tage, for the Payment of 50000 Crowns of Gold; but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would rather have Mortgaged half the Kingdom than left him in the Lurch, whom they knew to be one of their be&s;t Generals, and whom they commonly u&s;ed to &s;tile <HI>The Engli&s;h Achilles.</HI> The&s;e being all matters &s;ufficiently known, and the Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> was better acquainted with them than mo&s;t People, being a Lady of great Sen&s;e, and of an Eminent Rank at Court; however, &s;he would not interrupt him, and as he was very apt to &s;peak very pa&s;&s;ionately of a thing wherein he had acted &s;o Great and Noble a Part, and that the Pre&s;ence of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> had rai&s;ed in him an extraordinary Vi|vivacity,
<PB N="37" REF="40">
he would &s;ometimes talk &s;o loud, that the Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> who &s;et next to him, was not a little di&s;turb'd with the Noi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was &s;ure to improve the&s;e Happy Moments, in &s;aying now and then &s;ome engaging thing or other, with a low Voice, to the Counte&s;s; and therefore under Pretence that he us'd to chaw Tobacco, held his Handkerchief be|fore his Mouth, for fear her Mother &s;hould &s;u&s;pect &s;omething of the matter. He told her, He Adored her, That he de&s;ired nothing el&s;e in re|turn, but her Permi&s;&s;ion to &s;erve her with the &s;ame Re&s;pect as they do the God's; and, That he hop'd his unfeign'd and di&s;&s;intere&s;&s;ed Pa&s;&s;ion de&s;erved &s;omething of her Goodne&s;s. She pre|tended not to mind him, but under&s;tood very well all he &s;aid; and the Earl was &s;o much taken up with whi&s;pering, that the Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle|&s;ey</HI> &s;poke more than once to him, without recei|ving the lea&s;t An&s;wer: Her Daughter was much concern'd thereat, and tho' perhaps &s;he was not di&s;pleas'd with what he told her, &s;he would have bin very &s;orry to &s;ee the My&s;tery unravell'd. What prov'd an additional Satisfaction to the Earl, was, when he con&s;ider'd that he had thus bubbled both the Mother and the General, and thereby had got &s;ufficient Opportunity of decla|ring his Pa&s;&s;ion. Their Vi&s;it was &s;o long, that it exceeded all the Bounds of your ordinary Vi&s;its: The Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> did not come home, ne|verthele&s;s they made no Motions as if they in|tended to go; at la&s;t, my Lady <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> told them, not without &s;ome Marks of Unea&s;ine&s;s, It was very late, and perhaps her Son-in-law would Sup in the City. At the&s;e Words they aro&s;e and went their ways.</P>
<P>The General vex'd to the Heart, at the Ill Succe&s;s of this Vi&s;it, was ready to quarrel with the Earl on
<PB N="38" REF="41">
account of his &s;itting next the young Counte&s;s, alledging, That &s;ince he lov'd her, no Body el&s;e ought to pretend to that Place; but this Ill Humour was &s;o far from di&s;plea&s;ing his Rival, that he was highly delighted with it.</P>
<P>My Lord of <HI>Warwick</HI> having di&s;cover'd fre&s;h Charms in the Counte&s;s, both in reference to her Wit and Per&s;on, was afflicted to the Heart at the thoughts of her &s;o Dreadful Over&s;eer, meaning her Mother; and as he &s;aw no Means how to be rid of her, <HI>Alas!</HI> cry'd he, <HI>Alas! Is this the Pro&s;|pect of my approaching Happine&s;s! I am afraid I &s;hall be expos'd to abundance of Trouble, without the lea&s;t certainty of being recompenc'd according to my De&s;ires.</HI> He was not only perplex'd with his own Misfor|tune, but al&s;o forc'd to bear his full &s;hare in that of the General. He came to awaken him at Day break, to tell him &s;everal things, which would have prov'd but very indifferent Entertainment to him, had it not bin for the Name of the Counte&s;s, which being often intermingled in his Di&s;cour&s;e, did &s;omewhat allay his Ill Humour. The General had not bin able to hit another Opportunity to give her a Vi&s;it, becau&s;e the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> under&s;tanding how long they had &s;taid for his coming home, had made him &s;everal Vi&s;its one after another; and as the General was not very happy at contriving Love Intreagues, &s;o, what|ever pains he took to find out a &s;pecious Pretence, his Stock was quite exhau&s;ted, &s;o that he came to the Earl's in a very bad Humour. I am almo&s;t de&s;perate, <HI>&s;aid he to him,</HI> The Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> has bin &s;o often with me, that we have nothing more to &s;ay to one another; I have &s;ettled his Bu&s;ine&s;s much more to his Advantage than he could have done him&s;elf, and thereby have dealt unju&s;tly with one of my be&s;t Friends; and after all, I don't find all this to be look'd upon as de&s;erving any thing
<PB N="39" REF="42">
at this Jealous Fellow's Hands; I have a great mind, <HI>&s;aid he frowningly,</HI> to pick a Quarrel with him? For, What Benefit do I reap from the Obligations he owes me? I &s;ee his Lady no more, and I prote&s;t to you I am ready to be choak'd, and this forc'd Silence makes me lo&s;e every thing that might be plea&s;ing to her. To embroil your &s;elf with him, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> would be a very odd Method to hope for a favourable Reception from her: But you being better acquainted with him than I, let us pretend, That we have heard he has a mind to &s;ell his fine Seat near <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and that I am willing to pur|cha&s;e it; let us go to &s;ee him together, and, if he is at home, you &s;hall amu&s;e him in Di&s;cour&s;e, whil&s;t I will talk to the Counte&s;s, and prepare her to give you a favourable Reception; if he be abroad, you may lay hold of this Opportunity your &s;elf.</P>
<P>The General highly &s;atisfied with this Expe|dient, embrac'd it with all his Heart. So they &s;ent to the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> to know whether he were at Home, and were told he was not. This happening much to their Wi&s;h, they went thi|ther immediately, but found him come home. This News put them almo&s;t in to Di&s;pair, the Coach being already within the Gates of the Court-yard, in&s;tead of alighting, they began to con&s;ult what was be&s;t to be done, one was for going &s;traightways into the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>'s Apartment, the other was for going back without &s;eeing any Body; whil&s;t they were thus di&s;puting, the Counte&s;&s;es People look'd at them out of the Windows: At la&s;t, the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> &s;o far prevail'd with the General, that he was to alight alone, and make a &s;hort Vi&s;it, but mention not one Word concern|ing the Country-&s;eat. The matter was perform'd exactly as they had agreed together, the General &s;taid but a very &s;hort time with the Earl of <HI>Devon|&s;hire,</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="43">
which &s;eem'd to him a Year, and then came back to his Coach almo&s;t like a Mad-man. I am almo&s;t reduc'd to Di&s;pair, <HI>&s;aid he to the Earl,</HI> I meet with in&s;urmountable Ob&s;tacles in my Way; Were they made on purpo&s;e to plague me above all other Men? I have always heard them talk of Love as of a Secret Pa&s;&s;ion, full of Plea&s;ure, without any con&s;iderable Intermixture of Pain; I thought it was &s;ufficient to Love, to be belov'd again; to declare ones Love, and to have the Liberty of taking a Walk together; I have known a Thou|&s;and who courted their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es without much Difficulty, and a Thou&s;and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es that were not known but by the Name and Merits of their Lovers; but in my Ca&s;e every thing is very diffe|rent, I meet every where Dragons in my Way, whom I am forc'd to Combat. I could not &s;peak to her I adore, and my Patience is put to the harde&s;t Tryal that ever was. I have done, my Lord, I am quite tired of this way of Living, &s;o far different from what I was us'd to till now, I am re&s;olv'd to think of nothing but the recovery of my Liberty; this &s;hall be my only Mi&s;tre&s;s for the future, and I am &s;trangely mi&s;taken, if ever I part from her again.</P>
<P>He would have continued talking with the &s;ame Violence, all the remainder of the Day, had they, at their coming to Court, not immediately e&s;pi'd the King. The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> quite tired with the General's Complaints, and his own Vexation for not having bin able to &s;ee the Counte&s;s, made all the ha&s;t he could to approach his Maje&s;ty, who &s;eeing him alight out of his Coach, ask'd him &s;oon after, with a low Voice, From whence do you come? Sir, <HI>reply'd the Earl,</HI> your Maje&s;ty may ea&s;ily gue&s;s, &s;ince you &s;ee me with the General. I under&s;tand you, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> But you are in the Wrong, not to endeavour to cure
<PB N="41" REF="44">
him of his Pa&s;&s;ion; I know you are Malicious enough to encourage his Love by &s;ome Flatte|ring Hopes or other. There is no great occa|&s;ion for that, <HI>&s;aid the Earl laughing,</HI> he is apt enough to indulge him&s;elf in what he thinks a Plea&s;ure to him.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were thus talking, the King en|tring into his Clo&s;et, <HI>told him,</HI> I could not have believed the General would have Embark'd on &s;o weak a Bottom, e&s;pecially at &s;uch an Age as his, and therefore, the other day having a Mind to be &s;atisfy'd in that point, it &s;ucceeded according to my Wi&s;h: For I had the Picture of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> Drawn without her Knowledge, which the Picture-Drawer, (pur&s;uant to my in|&s;tructions) &s;ent to me to be Sold. The General happening to &s;ee it, was much di&s;compo&s;ed; but what plea&s;ed me be&s;t, was, that he did all he could to deceive me. The next day he went to the Limner, unto whom he gave a good Summ of Money, charging him to make me believe it was drawn for <HI>Ro&s;amond,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> II. Mi|&s;tre&s;s, who has bin dead above 300 years ago. I can't forbear laughing, when I con&s;ider how plea&s;ed he was, when he believed me to be &s;o ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon, and I have now no more rea&s;on to doubt, that it was his Intere&s;t that made him Conceal my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> from me. I know all that your Maje&s;ty has told me, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> The General Proud of having Acted &s;o nice a Part, came on purpo&s;e to tell it me, in hopes of being Applauded for his Conduct; and for my part, I was not backwards to &s;hew my &s;elf a Man of Com|plai&s;ance. He will be obliged to you for it, as long as he lives, <HI>reply'd the King.</HI> But you came from the Counte&s;&s;es, Pray what News there? She was invi&s;ible to us, <HI>reply'd the Earl,</HI> She did not appear; but her Husband did. The General was
<PB N="42" REF="45">
ready to Quarrel with him, becau&s;e he had &s;o little Breeding to be at Home, when he thought he had bin abroad.</P>
<P>The King return'd no an&s;wer to the Earl, but after pondering a little upon the Matter, <HI>at la&s;t told him,</HI> You &s;ee how all my Mirth is changed at once into Sadne&s;s, I am unea&s;ie at what the General is likely to &s;uffer, when he comes to be acquainted with the Intreague betwixt the Counte&s;s of <HI>De|von&s;hire</HI> and I. Then you are happy Sir, <HI>cry'd the Earl.</HI> No, hitherto I live only on Hopes, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> and were it not for <HI>Albine,</HI> who gives me &s;ome Com|fort, I would certainly act above-board with my Mi|&s;tre&s;s; For what is it I have to fear, and after all, how do I know whether her Governe&s;s does not deceive me? Your Maje&s;ty is above all this, <HI>&s;aid the Earl;</HI> But con&s;ider, whether it be not the hight of Plea&s;ure to a Heart &s;en&s;ible of the Nicities &s;o Love, to know, that you are perhaps the only Monarch in the World who&s;e Love is unreveal'd? Yes, <HI>an&s;wer'd the King,</HI> I &s;hould extreamly de|light in it, and reli&s;h this kind of My&s;tery in its utmo&s;t perfection, were I happy. But let us change the Theme: I am perhaps the only Mo|narch, who has Patience enough to Sigh &s;o long without knowing more of his De&s;tiny than I do; I &s;uffer my &s;elf to be guided by an Old Woman, I am afraid of di&s;obliging the Counte&s;s, and &s;uffer a great deal in hopes of one happy day. <HI>'Tis true added he,</HI> This day is not far off; for I am to &s;end the Earls of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> to <HI>York,</HI> though under a &s;lender pretence, their Bu|&s;ine&s;s being to inform them&s;elves concerning &s;ome differences aro&s;e in tho&s;e parts, whereof they are to give me an account. Probably your Maje&s;ty, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> will vi&s;it the Counte&s;s without any further Precaution, &s;o &s;oon as they are gone; I &s;ee only one Ob&s;tacle in the way, that is my Lady <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="46">
who keeps a very watchful Eye over her Daughter, but we mu&s;t give her a Do&s;e of <HI>Opium.</HI> You divert your &s;elf at your own Plea&s;ure, <HI>reply'd the King;</HI> you may be a&s;&s;ured I am not acquainted with the Temper of that Old Dragon; but I have contrived the Matter thus with <HI>Albine,</HI> The &s;ame Night I have &s;ent the Father and Husband to <HI>York,</HI> I am to come to a little Gate leading into the Garden, and in di&s;gui&s;e, and &s;o mu&s;t you. How! Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> will your Maje&s;ty take me for your Companion, perhaps to divert the good Old Governe&s;s? Much thereabouts, <HI>&s;aid the King;</HI> For you mu&s;t knock at the Great Gate in di&s;|gui&s;e, and ask to &s;peak with her; &s;o &s;oon as &s;he comes to you, you are to tell her, your Nephew has kill'd a Gentleman in a Duel, they are in &s;earch after him, he is hard by, and de&s;ire you would &s;helter him here only for one Night; He intends to go aboard a Ship before day-light, and you will Conduct him &s;afely into the <HI>Nether|lands.</HI> Hereupon, the Old Woman is to run Mumbling to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> to beg her to &s;uffer her Nephew to come into the Hou&s;e; and if &s;he can get the Key of the little Gate, I am to go up by a Private Pair of Stairs to the Counte&s;&s;es Apartment. But, &s;uppo&s;ing her Mother &s;hould refu&s;e to let you come in Sir, what will you do then, <HI>&s;aid the Earl?</HI> O, &s;he certainly will, for &s;he loves <HI>Albine,</HI> and will cer|tainly pity her Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The King having &s;poken the&s;e Words, went immediately into his Bed-Chamber, and the Earl to his Hou&s;e; but &s;o pierced with Pain and Vexation, that he threw him&s;elf upon his Bed, accu&s;ing his ill De&s;tiny, and upbraiding him&s;elf for having delay'd &s;o long to bring over <HI>Al|bine</HI> into his Intere&s;t. He could likewi&s;e not gue&s;s at the cau&s;e of Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Lucy</HI>'s Si|lence,
<PB N="44" REF="47">
all which joyn'd together, made him ima|gine him&s;elf the mo&s;t Unfortunate of any Man Living. I &s;hall never know, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> the ut|mo&s;t extent of my Di&s;grace: 'Tis my Ma&s;ter that is the cau&s;e thereof, who has pitch'd upon me for his Confident, and will have me go along with him to a Place, where I am not able to &s;ee him without dying upon the Spot. What! mu&s;t I leave him at the Counte&s;&s;es, after I have taken all the Pains that po&s;&s;ibly I can to get him Admittance? I would &s;ooner throw my &s;elf into the <HI>Thames.</HI> But, after all, won't it be better to be there pre&s;ent; becau&s;e I flatter my &s;elf, that &s;ome Accident or other may thwart the happy &s;ucce&s;s of this Interview. Thus the Earl Tor|mented him&s;elf, &s;ometimes &s;itting, &s;ometimes a|ri&s;ing; but all this while, &s;o overwhelm'd and en|tangled in Grief, that he knew not what Re|&s;olution to take: His Great Mind not u&s;ed to Buckle, was not &s;o much afflicted with having the King for his Rival, as with the Tenderne&s;s he &s;uppo&s;ed the Counte&s;s had for this Young Monarch. O! your Beautiful Eyes, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> What was it you would fain have told me at the very fir&s;t time I &s;aw you? What did you mean the o|ther day, by tho&s;e piercing Darts, &s;o full of Sprightline&s;s and Tenderne&s;s?

her Mi&s;tre&s;s loving the King &s;o well as &s;he does, &s;he will find out means to &s;ee him in Private? Thus he pa&s;s'd half the Night, without coming to any fix'd Re&s;olution; when on a &s;udden, &s;ome|thing came into his Head that afforded him &s;ome fre&s;h Hopes, and a little Comfort: He look'd upon the Succe&s;s thereof, as a kind of a Mira|cle which might produce a con&s;iderable change in his pre&s;ent afflicted Condition, and his Heart, which &s;eldom u&s;ed to de&s;pair, was willing to flat|ter it &s;elf with good Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>So, without troubling him&s;elf for the pre&s;ent, with the Concerns of the Family of my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> he did not oppo&s;e the going of the Father and Husband to <HI>York;</HI> but immediately went to &s;ee Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Lucy.</HI> How, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> &s;ince you have thought fit to Sacrifice your Reputation in pa&s;&s;ing for the King's Mi|&s;tre&s;s, will you &s;uffer with Patience to &s;ee him &s;natch'd away from you? Your Conque&s;t will be attended with nothing but Shame at this rate. 'Tis this Night, Madam, That is to de|cide your Fate; The King has not bin able hi|therto to entertain the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> in Private, but now every thing is prepared for his &s;ecret entrance there: Will you let this go on with the &s;ame Tranquility wherewith you have neglected my fir&s;t Council? My Lord, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I have not bin in&s;en&s;ible of the Misfortune that threatned me; I flatter'd my &s;elf, that my Di&s;&s;atisfaction, and my Tenderne&s;s, might efface my Rival out of that Heart, whereof I once had the ab&s;olute Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; I &s;taid for &s;ome favourable opportunity of di&s;clo&s;ing my &s;elf to the King: But &s;ince the Ca&s;e is &s;o pre&s;|&s;ing, I mu&s;t &s;end to de&s;ire him to make me a Vi&s;it, that I might load him with Reproaches. That I may Cry, and that I may Threaten, I

will kill my &s;elf before his Face, if he leaves me. Nothing can be better, Madam, <HI>&s;aid the Earl;</HI> but I beg you, let me but &s;ee you Act one Part of this Comedy, that either I may Applaud or Correct you; for you know I am a Critick at Plays. No, no, my Lord, <HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> This is no matter of diver&s;ion to me, I never was &s;o much Concern'd at any thing in all my Life; But, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, after having pau&s;ed a while,</HI> I know not how the King came to the Knowledge of the Counte&s;s, nor how it came to pa&s;s that &s;he lov'd him &s;o; you mu&s;t in&s;truct me in this Point. The Earl approving her Propo&s;ition, gave her an account of his Hunting at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and at the &s;ame time, charg'd her, not to mention any thing of this Evening's Meeting, becau&s;e the King would certainly charge him with the di&s;|covery thereof, having Communicated the Secret to no body el&s;e but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>There was no great occa&s;ion for the Earl of <HI>War|wick</HI> to encourage Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Lucy,</HI> &s;he was too nearly concerned in the Matter, not to make u&s;e of all her Arms; and &s;he re&s;olv'd to take all the ad|vantages &s;he could. Her Nght Gown was of Gold and Blue Silk, Trimm'd at the Edges with pre|cious Stones; Her Head was carele&s;ly dre&s;s'd, without hiding the Lu&s;tre of her Coal-black Hair; She wore the King's Picture on one of her Arms, and in &s;hort, con&s;ulted her Looking Gla&s;s &s;o well, that &s;he had never appear'd more Beautiful in all her Life. Having &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to the King, to de&s;ire him to make her a Vi&s;it, He did not fail to come according|ly; for no Man could have paid her more Re|&s;pect than he did; and notwith&s;tanding his new Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he had an almo&s;t uncontroulable A|&s;cendant over him. He was not a little di|&s;turb'd at the earne&s;t Me&s;&s;age &s;he &s;ent him, and turning towards the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> What
<PB N="47" REF="50">
does &s;he want with me, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> can't you gue&s;s? Sir, <HI>an&s;wered the Earl,</HI> my Gue&s;s is, That &s;he that is a Mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;o Young and Hand&s;ome a King, as you are, does de&s;ire nothing more than to &s;ee him, to plea&s;e him, and to take care of a Heart, in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion whereof con&s;i&s;ts the Fe|licity of her Life: For the re&s;t, I can't tell whe|ther &s;he has any other Bu&s;ine&s;s, which has o|bliged her to &s;end this Compliment to your Ma|je&s;ty. I will go thither, and pa&s;s away half an hour, <HI>&s;aid the King;</HI> for I am re&s;olved that no|thing &s;hall come in my way, to hinder this Nights Appointment. The Earl being highly di&s;&s;atisfy'd at the&s;e Words, to detain the King the longer, put him in mind, that he had promi&s;ed to give Audience to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour, who was ready to come to Court, and that he had better to pay his Vi&s;it to the Young <HI>Elizabeth</HI> after the Au|dience was over.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the King delay'd his Vi&s;it; but no &s;ooner was the Amba&s;&s;ador gone, but he went to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, whom he found Singing in a Me|lancholly Tone. So &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw the King, &s;he left off; but the King de&s;ir'd her to go on: <HI>As the Swan,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>near the Banks of the River</HI> Seman|der, <HI>bemoans his Death by his la&s;t Song, &s;o I foretell mine this day; yes, Sir, I foretell it, and reproach you with being the Cau&s;e thereof.</HI> He Blu&s;h'd at the&s;e Words, and gave her a Tender look; What is it, &s;aid he, you mean, to reproach me thus unde&s;erved|ly? She then laid open the Matter to him with Tears in her Eyes. The King &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee her &s;o well acquainted with the whole Matter, &s;tood it out neverthele&s;s mo&s;t Boldly, <HI>telling her,</HI> That nothing in the World was more Fal&s;e; That he had never &s;een the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> except for one Moment at her own Hou&s;e, whil&s;t he was at <HI>Wind&s;or;</HI> and that ever &s;ince that time, he had not &s;o
<PB N="48" REF="51">
much as ever thought of her; That, if it were true, that he had bin &s;o far &s;truck with her Beau|ty as &s;he imagin'd, it would perhaps not have proved impo&s;&s;ible for him to have &s;een her again; But his Opinion was, that &s;ome Body or other had contrived to make her kill her &s;elf with her own Weapons; becau&s;e they knew he was a declared Enemy again&s;t &s;uch like Inqui&s;itive Practices. The Marchione&s;s touch'd to the Heart to &s;ee him &s;tand it out &s;o &s;tifly to conceal his Infidelity, be|gan to be in a mo&s;t Furious Rage, and would not &s;uffer him to &s;tir out of the Room; and &s;o &s;oon as he began to talk of going, made mo&s;t doleful Lamentations and Outcry's, declaring &s;he would kill her &s;elf before his Face. As he knew very well, that my Lord <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI>'s and <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>'s Journey would take up &s;ome days, he con&s;idered that there would be no great difference in his En|joyment, if he deferr'd to &s;ee the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> till the next Night; &s;o, that he did not part with Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Lucy</HI> till very late, which appeas'd her Anger a little for the pre&s;ent; and the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> very inqui&s;itive after e|very thing that was Tran&s;acted there, under&s;tand|ing that the King had ordered his Supper to be &s;erved up there, did not que&s;tion, but that the Neck of the other Intreague was broken, at lea&s;t for that Night.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;urmize, he di&s;gui&s;es him&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible he could, and taking along with him Mr. <HI>Berincour,</HI> one of his Gentlemen, who for a con&s;iderable time pa&s;t had bin his Confident in his Nocturnal Rambles, tells him the whole Con|cern, and &s;o tru&s;ting to his good Fortune, away he goes to the little Gate of the Garden of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> and immediately &s;ends <HI>Be|rincour</HI> to &s;peak to <HI>Albine.</HI> The Action he was upon, was &s;o full of Temerity, that he him&s;elf dur&s;t

not make a due Reflection upon the danger that might attend it. He was to deceive the Young Counte&s;s in Per&s;onating the King; when at the &s;ame time, he knew not the Place of their Ap|pointment, and whether it were to be by the light, or in the dark; He could not but dread every thing from his Ma&s;ter, if the thing &s;hould come to his Knowledge; Be&s;ides a Thou&s;and un|fore&s;een Accidents, as dangerous in their Con&s;e|quences as any of the re&s;t. But his Natural In|trepidity, and his Love making him con&s;ider all the&s;e Dangers, for no other end than to outbrave them; he went on as fa&s;t as he could, without he|&s;itating upon the Matter: So &s;oon as he was come near the Garden, he &s;topt a little to &s;tay for <HI>Be|rincour</HI>'s return from <HI>Albine,</HI> who had managed e|very thing with &s;o much Dexterity, that the Earl heard her coming much &s;ooner than he could or dur&s;t have expected, and turning a Key a Thou&s;and times in the Lock, without being able to unlock it. <HI>Albine</HI> never made u&s;e of that Key and now was &s;o much di&s;compo&s;ed at this Accident, that &s;he did not know what to do, all the Pains &s;he took to open the Lock proving to no purpo&s;e, &s;he at la&s;t broke it; She was then forced to tell him through a Cranny of the Door, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to open it being in the dark and not daring to fetch a light; And that, for this time, &s;he knew not what could further be done. The Earl, almo&s;t reduced to Di&s;pair con|&s;idering, that in ca&s;e he lo&s;t this Opportunity he could not meet with another &s;o &s;uitable to his Purpo&s;e, &s;ince the King's coming in Per&s;on would &s;oon unfold the riddle; and under&s;tanding what had happened, would bear him as much ill will, as if he actually entertain'd the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>He was very Tall and Large, the Wall was none of the highe&s;t, and he had ob&s;erved that day,
<PB N="50" REF="53">
when he found my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> in the <HI>Grotto,</HI> that there were &s;ome Nails fa&s;tned into it; &s;o he got upon the Shoulders of his Gentleman, who being none of the lea&s;t, he &s;crambled over the Top of the Wall, though not without a good many &s;cratches. He no &s;ooner got into the Gar|den, but he emptied his Pockets that were full of Gold, de&s;iring <HI>Albine,</HI> with a Gentile Air, to keep them for him; She believing him to be the King, was very ready to accept them, though at the &s;ame time, &s;he was under no &s;mall apprehen&s;ion, le&s;t this Intrigue, if di&s;covered, might prove fatal to &s;ome body or other, and upon that &s;core, was &s;o far overwhelm'd with Thoughts, that, had &s;he &s;een the Earl, &s;he would &s;carce have known him. He went along with her to a Private pair of Stairs, when the Old Gentlewoman remaining below, told him, <HI>He would find my Lady</HI> Devon&s;hire <HI>in a Room above.</HI> He was con&s;idering with him&s;elf, how to ju&s;tifie this Treachery again&s;t the King, and her &s;elf, when approaching to a Door, &s;ome body took him by the Hand, he follow'd &s;oftly into a Chamber, where, without giving him lei|&s;ure to &s;peak, he was told, <HI>What will you think of me, my Lord, I dare not as much as ask it? The Steps I now make, ought to appear to you &s;o Criminal, that I am perhaps upon the point of lo&s;ing all that E&s;teem you gave me &s;uch a&s;&s;urances of, when you came hither along with the General</HI> Talbot. The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was &s;urprized to &s;uch a degree, at what he heard, as to remain under the greate&s;t uncertainty, what an&s;wer to give: <HI>By what Ac|cident,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;hould this Per&s;on know, that I am not the King? For, though &s;he does not &s;ee me, &s;he is too well inform'd of the whole Matter, thus to mi&s;take me. Is this a Snare wherein to catch me? Am I with my Charming Counte&s;s, or with &s;ome body el&s;e that intends to Trap me?</HI> He had not much time to con|&s;ider
<PB N="51" REF="54">
of his pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, becau&s;e the Lady expected his An&s;wer, in order to continue their Conver&s;ation. <HI>I am &s;o far confounded at this Exce&s;s of my good Fortune,</HI> &s;aid he to her, <HI>that in&s;tead of en|tertaining any Thoughts that might be injurious to you, I find my Tenderne&s;s and Acknowledgment encrea&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, as is impo&s;&s;ible to be expre&s;s'd. However, Madam, in the mid&s;t of all my Happine&s;s, I mu&s;t confe&s;s to you, that I want the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you, which I beg of you to afford me. With all my Heart,</HI> reply'd &s;he, <HI>I will go and fetch a light.</HI> She went out to call <HI>Albine,</HI> who trembling for fear, had no power to come up, but had &s;tood all this while at the Bottom of the Stairs, and was now ready to run out of her Wits, when &s;he was ordered to bring up a Torch; For now &s;he thought her &s;elf lo&s;t for ever, the rea&s;on was this:</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, that at the fir&s;t Vi&s;it the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> made to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> that fatal Star, which &s;ometimes enforces a Heart, to enter upon an Amorous Engagement for the remainder of ones Life, had &s;uch a Pow|erful Influence upon hers, that &s;he did not take all the nece&s;&s;ary Precautions to defend her &s;elf a|gain&s;t that De&s;tiny which we ought to re&s;i&s;t with all our Might. On the contrary, &s;he Cheri&s;h'd her Pa&s;&s;ion, and as &s;he had her Mind wholly taken up with the Earl, &s;he told <HI>Albine, &s;he would have no body &s;peak to her of the King.</HI> This old Go|verne&s;s, ready to run di&s;tracted at the Thoughts to lo&s;e all at once, the Benefit of &s;uch Rich Pre&s;ents, took care not to contradict her Mi|&s;tre&s;s, judging that this would prove a means to unfold a &s;ecret, &s;he intended to make her &s;elf Mi&s;tre&s;s of, for her own Benefit. <HI>Your Aver&s;ion to the King,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>is not the effect of your Con|&s;iderations, Madam, but of &s;omething el&s;e, that plea&s;es you; Pray, put an entire Confidence in me,</HI>

I entreat you to let the King know, how unea&s;ie my Family is upon his Account, and that I beg him, not to entertain any further Thoughts of me; This being the only Favour I reque&s;t at his Hands, in recompence for all the Re&s;pect I bear him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Albine</HI> was at a &s;tand what to do, &s;ince to break off an Intrigue &s;he judged &s;he had almo&s;t brought to its Period, was altogether again&s;t her Intere&s;t. She had a Nephew, who being a &s;en&s;ible Fellow, &s;he made him a Partner in the &s;ecret; It was then agreed betwixt them, that nothing &s;hould be told to the King, concerning the Counte&s;&s;es indiffe|rency for him; and that the better to conceal the Matter, they were to open her Letters written to him, and in lieu thereof, &s;end &s;ome of their own making, Written in her own Name. Though this was a very hazardous Project, yet was it well reli&s;h'd by <HI>Albine,</HI> who was prolonging this In|trigue at any rate.

The old Governe&s;s much plea&s;ed with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">opes of his &s;peedy departure, went to fetch a light; But gue&s;s at her Surprize when in lieu of the King, whom &s;he expected to meet, &s;he &s;aw it was the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> &s;he &s;tood &s;tupify'd like a Stone, without any Moti|on, except of her Eyes and Mouth, but with|out being able to utter one Word: I am &s;en&s;ible, <HI>Albine,</HI> of the whole Matter, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> though I want time to explain my &s;elf at this Juncture; Pray find out a way for me to &s;ee your Mi&s;tre&s;s; And I will make Peace both for my &s;elf and you. Follow me, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> but go &s;oftly, I hope there is one Door or other left unlock'd, for us to enter: Nor was it long before they found a pri|vate Door, which leading into a Wardrobe, they went forwards, and &s;urprized my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> all melting in Tears, and lying up|on

The Earl threw him&s;elf at her Feet, before &s;he was &s;en&s;ible any body was near her; Is it po&s;&s;ible, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> my Divine Coun|te&s;s, I &s;hould be &s;o unfortunate as to &s;ee you &s;hun me? All the&s;e hazards I expo&s;e my &s;elf to, in com|ing hither, &s;hould not they be look'd upon as the true effects of my Pa&s;&s;ion? How! <HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> You mu&s;t come along with the King; Oh! I little thought, my Lord, you would have acted his Confident here? Though I am not quite ignorant, Madam, <HI>reply'd the Earl,</HI> of his Sentiments for you, yet I de|clare to you, I &s;hould have expired with Grief, before I could come along with him: No, Madam, I am alone, and come for no other rea&s;on, than to &s;eek your Aid I &s;tand &s;o much in need of, to &s;upport my &s;elf under tho&s;e Pains which are in&s;e|parable Attendants of an unfortunate Pa&s;&s;ion. I neither will, nor can afford you any help, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid the Counte&s;s,</HI> neither did I give my Con&s;ent of &s;eeing you upon any other Account, but to clear you at once of tho&s;e flattering Con|ceptions, you have taken in re&s;pect to me. Go on Madam, make an end at once, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> Stab me to the Heart, here is my Sword; and &s;ince I have bin &s;o bold as to lift up my Eyes to adore you, don't refu&s;e me the Grace of being Puni&s;h'd by your own Hands: But if your Goodne&s;s would afford me &s;ome few Moments to enter upon my Ju&s;tification, I could, Madam, make you &s;en&s;ible of the &s;incerity of my Pa&s;&s;ion. Do you remember, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, interrupting him,</HI> that you talk to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> who can't be innocent as long as &s;he hears you talk at that rate? Then cea&s;e for ever to love me, and to tell me that you do; for I can make you no other returns, but tho&s;e of Ingrati|tude? Oh!

The&s;e Words occa&s;ion'd an inex|pre&s;&s;ible Confu&s;ion in the Earl, in &s;pite of tho&s;e few Glimp&s;es of Hopes he conceived in &s;ome of her Expre&s;&s;ions, in entertaining him at &s;o late an Hour, and in &s;o &s;ecret a manner; but &s;he &s;till in|treated him to de&s;i&s;t, and not to di&s;turb her Repo&s;e by &s;uch Addre&s;&s;es, for which &s;he &s;hould think her &s;elf but little obliged to him. The Earl an&s;wered to every Particular with &s;o much Re&s;pect and Pa&s;&s;ion, that at la&s;t &s;he could not refrain from telling him, with a very melancholy Air: Oh! my Lord, How came I to know you! What a &s;trange Fatality to happen to a young Per&s;on, who always led a retired Life! Alas! Madam, per|mit me, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> to bear &s;ome Share in your &s;oli|tude, I &s;hould think my &s;elf too Happy; and it &s;hould be the only Endeavour of my Life, and all my Care, to allay the Hard&s;hips of your Re|tiredne&s;s by a Thou&s;and complai&s;ant Actions.

<P>The Earl was &s;o much &s;urprized with Admiration at a Thou&s;and other pretty things &s;he told him, that the time pa&s;s'd away very fa&s;t; and as, according to the old Proverb, <HI>A Lover's Watch goes &s;eldom exact;</HI> &s;o, had it not bin for <HI>Albine</HI> they had &s;carce parted at yet, tho' it was already break of Day.

<P><HI>Berincour</HI> &s;tai'd, for the Earl's coming, under the Wall, but there was no occa&s;ion for his helping him over it, as he was oblig'd to do before, <HI>Albine</HI> who attended him, having found Means by this time to open the little Door; and being by his great Promi&s;es entirely engaged in his In|tere&s;t, &s;he told him, She would, by repre&s;enting to the King the Indifferency of the Counte&s;s for his Per&s;on, endeavour to Cure him of a Pa&s;&s;ion which hath a much greater &s;hare of Inconveniencies than Plea&s;ure in it.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Warwick</HI> now overjoy'd at his Inter|view with my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> goes home, to be|&s;tow the be&s;t part of the Night in indulging his Fancy with the fre&s;h Remembrance of &s;o Charm|ing a Per&s;on.

What an Alteration! <HI>cry'd the Earl:</HI> What is the Matter, my Lord? May one be permitted to know &s;ome Part of your Secrets?

<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">imner, who &s;old me the Picture of this Lady, judging by the great Value he &s;aw me put upon it, and by the In&s;tructions I gave him to per&s;uade the King that it was the Fair <HI>Ro&s;amond</HI>'s Picture, that all the&s;e things were not done with|out very weighty Rea&s;ons on my &s;ide; and that therefore my Heart bore great &s;hare in all the&s;e A&s;&s;iduities, at la&s;t began to be &s;atisfy'd I was in Love with the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI> As he was not ignorant, of how difficult an acce&s;s &s;he was, &s;o he propo&s;ed to me the removing of the&s;e Ob&s;ta|cles, which otherwi&s;e might prevent my having an Interview with her.

Don't you wonder, <HI>continued he,</HI> at the oddne&s;s of Chance, how that things that &s;eem to be &s;ome|times at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from our Hopes, are brought to pa&s;s by &s;uch unexpected Means?

<P>The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> could hold no longer, but bur&s;t out a laughing, a thing he would not have bin fond of at another time, but that he had bin with the Counte&s;s the &s;ame Night. I find, <HI>&s;aid the General,</HI> (without giving him lea&s;ure to &s;peak)

by your Mirth, you are overjoy'd at my Good Fortune. I am, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> to &s;uch a degree, that I &s;hould be le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of my own.

The Earl was ready to bur&s;t, to keep him&s;elf from laughing at the Gene|ral's Fancy, of being belov'd by the Counte&s;s, and at his being thus impos'd upon by the Limner. This made him mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly reflect upon the Frailties even of the greate&s;t Men in the World, when once they are &s;eiz'd with a violent Pa&s;&s;ion; and had his own, for my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> not got quite the A&s;cendant over him, he would have abjur'd and vow'd, not to engage in it as long as he liv'd.

I can't do that, <HI>cry'd the King,</HI> and &s;o leaning again&s;t a Tree, continued in a deep &s;tudy for &s;ome|time till he who us'd to receive the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>'s Letters, pre&s;ented one to him. At the &s;ight of this dear Character recovering him&s;elf, he open'd the Pacquet with much Precipitation, but found nothing therein that pleas'd him; for &s;he told him (as has been agreed upon betwixt her and <HI>Albine</HI>) That the Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> had made her a Bed-chamber, &s;o near to her own, that they mu&s;t pa&s;s through the la&s;t into the fir&s;t: And that, &s;ince &s;he mu&s;t be lo&s;t for ever, if this Intrigue &s;hould be known in the Family, &s;he begg'd him, not to di&s;turb her Repo&s;e, by doing an Action, the Noi&s;e whereof, mu&s;t needs co&s;t her infinite Vexation and Troubles: And that he would be plea&s;ed to &s;tay for a more favourable Conjuncture.</P>
<P>The Stile of this Letter being very different from that of the preceeding ones, put the King actually in a Pa&s;&s;ion, he tore it to pieces, &s;aying, She de&s;erved not the Re&s;pect he had always &s;hewn her, and that the whole &s;avouring very much of a Fickledne&s;s, he would make her repent of it; and that after having ruined her Reputation by the publi&s;hing of his Pa&s;&s;ion for her, he would compleat her De&s;truction by his Indifferency: That he intended to go &s;ee her in Per&s;on, and to upbraid her in the Face of the whole Court, with her Incon&s;tancy. That would prove an infallible Means, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> of the Death at lea&s;t of three People; <HI>Elizabeth Lucy</HI> will certainly

No matter, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> I am re&s;olv'd once in my Life time to follow the Inclinations of my own Heart, without hearkening to a thou&s;and Rea|&s;ons, that are contradictory to my Satisfaction. I don't pre&s;ume &s;o far, Sir, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Earl,</HI> as to engage your Maje&s;ty into what I propo&s;e, in good earne&s;t: Madam <HI>Elizabeth Lucy</HI> is not de|&s;erving enough for you to offer any Violence to your Inclinations; General <HI>Talbot</HI> has acted a very unwi&s;e Part, to give way to &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion; and as for the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> I would advi&s;e your Maje&s;ty to make Love to her with Trumpets &s;ounding tho' &s;he was to be poi&s;on'd within a Quarter of an Hour after. Whil&s;t he was talking thus, the King remain'd in a ruminating Po&s;ture, without an&s;wering a Word, and &s;oon after return'd to his Palace.</P>
<P>Immediately after Dinner, he went to pay a Vi&s;it to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, whom he pre&s;ented with a very rich Jewel; it was an Excellent Piece of Engraving upon a large Ruby of a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Lu&s;tre; be&s;ides which there was a fine Diamond cut in the Shape of a Heart; the whole Devi&s;e repre&s;ented a Moon in a va&s;t Sea, with this In|&s;cription, <HI>She cau&s;es my Calms and my Tempe&s;ts.</HI> He told her at the &s;ame time a thou&s;and engaging things, conjuring her, for the future, not to load him with Reproaches he de&s;erved not. The Marchione&s;s receiv'd it with equal Demon&s;tra|tions of Joy and Acknowledgment: She was over|jy'd to find the Devi&s;e apply'd to her; not|with&s;tanding which, with Tears in her Eyes, &s;he made &s;ome few gentle Reflections upon the King.

Day would not urge her at that time, to di&s;cover to him the Per&s;ons who had given her information of the&s;e things; tho' at the &s;ame time he continu'd in his Re&s;olution of finding it out. It was &s;o late, before all the Articles of Peace were well regulated, that they Supp'd together. When the Earl came to pay his Re&s;pects to the King, and found him&s;elf at full Liberty, to &s;peak his Senti|ments, My thinks, <HI>&s;aid he to the King,</HI> I &s;ee in your Eyes, the Conque&s;t of Madam <HI>Elizabeth Lucy,</HI> and the Defeat of my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI> No, <HI>re|ply'd he,</HI> you are mi&s;taken in your Sight: There is &s;till remaining in my Heart, a very agreeable Idea, I am not able to efface &s;o &s;oon as I would. But, Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> dare I take the Liberty, to ask your Maje&s;ty if really you could wi&s;h it &s;o? The King, after pau&s;ing a while, <HI>reply'd,</HI> I don't very well know what I could wi&s;h, for I imagine to my &s;elf an ab&s;olute Felicity in plea&s;ing the Counte&s;s; but on the other Hand am di&s;&s;atisfy'd with her, and fear, le&s;t Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Lucy</HI> &s;hould die for Vexation, unle&s;s &s;he has the Preference before the other. What then intend you to do, Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Earl?</HI> I am re&s;olved to talk with my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire, added the King.</HI> This being the very thing the Earl dreaded mo&s;t, either for fear of the Noi&s;e &s;uch a Vi&s;it would make in the World or the Jealou&s;y the Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> might conceive thereat, or out of a ju&s;t Appre|hen&s;ion, le&s;t the Counte&s;s might be overtaken with the De&s;erts and Grandure of this young Monarch: But on which &s;ide &s;oever he con&s;ider'd it, it appear'd very dangerous to him. Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> you may write to the Counte&s;s, to let her know, that, unle&s;s &s;he will find out &s;ome Oppor|tunity for you to &s;ee her, you know how to pitch upon a Time your &s;elf, let the Con&s;equence to her prove what it will.

The King lik'd his Advice, being well pleas'd not to give any real Occa&s;ion of Pain to one, whil&s;t he &s;ought to plea&s;e the other.</P>
<P>The Earl was no &s;ooner return'd home, but he writ to his charming Counte&s;s every thing a Heart full of Love is able to in&s;pire into a Man, e&s;pecially when he flatters him&s;elf not to be hated by the Party belov'd; he being a Per&s;on of an uncommon Vivacity of Thoughts, and mo&s;t refin'd Wit, his Expre&s;&s;ions were &s;o Nice, Natural and Noble, that his Wit prov'd as great a Charm to the Counte&s;s, as his Per&s;on. Being ready to die with Impatience, he de&s;ir'd Permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee her again; but things were to be done with &s;o much Circum&s;pection, that they dur&s;t not &s;o &s;oon venture at another Nocturnal Rendezvous, which might prove of very ill Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>However, they having found means to get the print of the Key of the Little-Garden-gate, be|fore it was return'd to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey, Albine</HI> &s;ent it to the Earl, who charging <HI>Berincour</HI> to have one made immediately after the &s;ame Pattern; he &s;poke about it to a Lock-Smith, who after a great many Exceptions (to enhaunce the Price of his Labour) at la&s;t, made one according to the Mould.</P>
<P>The Earl being extreamly glad to &s;ee him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of a Key, that could give him Entrance into the Garden, now expected, with the utmo&s;t Impatience, the next favourable Opportunity to make u&s;e of it; when the King &s;ent him a Me&s;&s;en|ger, before Day break, to order him to come to Court, He made all the ha&s;te he could, and found the King already in his Clo&s;et, much di|&s;turbed

The Earl u&s;ed always to &s;hew a great deal of Satisfaction, when|ever he was to leave <HI>London</HI> on account of ap|pearing in Arms for the King; but upon this Occa&s;ion he was too &s;en&s;ible, how much the God|de&s;s of Love, prevailed over the God of War. The King much &s;urprized at his Silence and heavy Countenance, What is the matter, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> you are &s;o much alter'd that I &s;carce know you; it &s;eems as if you were troubled at the Choice I have made? No, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I am very &s;en&s;ible of your Goodne&s;s, and am re&s;olv'd to acquit my &s;elf &s;o well of my Duty, that you &s;hall have no Rea&s;on to repent of having preferr'd my Services to the re&s;t. Ah! <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> I find how it is; you are in Love? You have found nothing, Sir, <HI>reply'd the Earl, with a Smile,</HI> I am preparing to obey your Orders. He went &s;traightways home, but full of Trouble and Vexation. He &s;ent <HI>Berincour</HI> to &s;peak with <HI>Albine,</HI> and to promi&s;e her any thing &s;he could de&s;ire in the World, provided &s;he would find out but a few favourable Moments, wherein he might bid Adieu to his Fair Mi&s;tre&s;s. She left no Stone unturn'd to do it; but in &s;pite of all her Care and Indu&s;try, no Opportunity did offer, and my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> would not give a helping Hand to procure one.

<P>Of this &s;he was even ready to repent, as &s;oon as it was done; and told <HI>Albine,</HI> What would be|come of me, &s;hould this Billet be intercepted? 'Tis not enough for one to be Innocent; but one ought to act &s;o, as not to appear blameable to any.

The King vex'd to the Heart at her Ab&s;ence, went on purpo&s;e to fetch her; He made her a thou&s;and Reproaches, on account of her Indifferency; but at the &s;ame time, omitted nothing that might engage her to come to Court: You are too dangerous, Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to him, with a gay and mo&s;t charming Air;</HI> Hitherto my Vertue was never put to the Try|al, living alone at my own Home at the Bot|tom of a Village, intent upon nothing but how to plea&s;e my Husband, and to lament his lo&s;s. I have &s;een nothing hitherto that gave me the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion of Fear; But, I am very &s;en&s;ible Sir, &s;hould I &s;ee you often, I &s;hould have great Occa&s;ion to dread you; I am al&s;o no le&s;s &s;en|&s;ible, that my Virtue will never &s;toop &s;o low,

<P>The King, who was not u&s;ed to be &s;o frankly dealt withal, having pau&s;ed a little upon the Matter, <HI>told her,</HI> She might expect every thing from her De&s;erts; That he could never be Hap|py without her; That he would give his Pro|mi&s;e to marry her, but that it mu&s;t be kept &s;ecret, and not to be di&s;clo&s;ed upon any account whatever; &s;ince he had as yet many Enemies, who would not fail to improve his Marriage with her to his Di&s;advantage; That therefore he Conjured her, to put Confidence in the Word of a Prince, who adored her, and that, unle&s;s &s;he came to <HI>London,</HI> he was re&s;olved to find her out every day in the Country. The Lady look'd upon this Conde&s;cen&s;ion in the King, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> not rejecting her Propo&s;ition of en|gaging in &s;o unequal a Match, as &s;o &s;ignal a Favour, that &s;he had no longer Power to refu&s;e to come to Court, where &s;he came to live with the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Bedford</HI> her Mother. The &s;e|veral Vi&s;its the King had made to this fair Wi|dow, the &s;atisfaction he expre&s;s'd at her coming to <HI>London,</HI> together with the Care he took in fitting up her Lodgings, occa&s;ioned an extream Jea|lou&s;y in Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Lucy.</HI> On the other Hand, Madam <HI>Grey,</HI> who had no le&s;s her own Intere&s;t in view, judged it very requi&s;ite to en|gage the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> on her &s;ide, which &s;he effected by giving him peculiar Marks of her E&s;teem, and Confidence in him, &s;uch, as &s;he was &s;en&s;ible he could do no otherwi&s;e than re|pay

with Acknowledgment; She Conjured him, to cultivate for ever a &s;trict Friend&s;hip with her, and to give her &s;ome in&s;ight concerning tho&s;e Per&s;ons &s;he ought to fear mo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Earl overjoy'd at this Propo&s;ition, repre|&s;ented to her the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> as the Per|&s;on for whom the King had the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Inclination: He de&s;ired her, to keep this as an ab&s;olute Secret promi&s;ing to adverti&s;e her, from time to time, of whatever was likely to impair her Intere&s;t: So that, as often as he ob&s;erved in the King &s;ome Relap&s;es of his Tenderne&s;s for this Counte&s;s, he gave Notice thereof either by Word of Mouth, or by Letters to Madam <HI>Grey;</HI> who made u&s;e of Tears, and &s;ometimes of Threats, that &s;he would retire into the Coun|try: All this was done &s;o &s;ea&s;onably, that the King took all imaginable Care to conceal from her, the Frailty of his Heart, though at the &s;ame time, he let &s;lip no Opportunity of obliging the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire:</HI> He would write to her, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Albine,</HI> &s;ometimes in the Language of a Lover, &s;ometimes of a So|veraign Ma&s;ter, but always like a King full of Pa&s;&s;ion; But the De&s;erts of my Lord of <HI>War|wick,</HI> had made &s;o lively an Impre&s;&s;ion upon her Heart, that in &s;pire of all her Endeavours to bani&s;h him thence, he was always there pre&s;ent, this being the only thing &s;he now took any &s;atisfacti|on in, and all the re&s;t proving indifferent to her. She would not take the Trouble of Dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf, nay, &s;he would blame her &s;elf to appear in any &s;et Dre&s;s &s;ince it was not done to plea&s;e him; Neither was there any Conver&s;ation &s;he &s;o much delighted in, as in that of <HI>Albine,</HI> becau&s;e it was to her alone &s;he could &s;peak, concerning the Per&s;on &s;he had already loved too much, for the Tranquility of her Life.</P>

The Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> who narrowly ob|&s;erved all the Actions of her Daughter, did not impart to any body Living, the Surprize &s;he was in, to find &s;o &s;trange an Alteration in her Daugh|ter; but re&s;olved to di&s;cour&s;e her upon that Point, believing, that, con&s;idering her tender Age, and mo&s;t excellent Education, &s;he would not fail to make an ingenuous Confe&s;&s;ion: So, without in&s;i&s;ting upon any further Preliminaries in the Matter, &s;he took her Daughter one day into the Garden, at an Hour when it was yet too Hot to take much Diver&s;ion in walking for any con&s;iderable time, and leaning upon her, went into the Grotto, under Pretence of being &s;corch|ed by the Heat of the Sun, and of having a Mind to re&s;t a little there; but in effect, to talk to her in that Place with the more freedom.

<P>Whil&s;t &s;he was a talking, the young Counte&s;s was Ruminating what an&s;wer to give her, and what was be&s;t to be done in &s;o pre&s;&s;ing a Ca&s;e as this; She knew very well, her Mother to be a Woman of great Sen&s;e and Penetration, &s;he knew her to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">aughty, po&s;itive in her Opi|nion, and one who would not be removed from what &s;he had once conceived to be true, let her &s;ay what &s;he would: But, to Sacrifice the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> was &s;uch an affliction, her Heart could not in the lea&s;t con&s;ent to, &s;ince this Con|fe&s;&s;ion mu&s;t for ever Rob her of the Plea&s;ures of &s;eeing him.

With the&s;e Words, She put the King's la&s;t Letter into her Mother's Hands, (which was delivered to her by

<HI>Albine</HI>) who having Peru&s;ed it, bur&s;t out into Tears for Joy; and embracing her Daughter, My Dear Child, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to her,</HI> don't fear any Man living, we are too Happy in &s;o Vertuous a Daughter; How few are there, that would not be puff'd up with the Pa&s;&s;ion of &s;on Amia|ble a King? But how dangerous it is to tru&s;t him; You &s;ee his unfaithfulne&s;s to the Fair <HI>E|lizabeth Lucy,</HI> and the lovely Madam <HI>Grey;</HI> both which he loved &s;o Pa&s;&s;ionately, being Charm'd with their Beauties: Re&s;t &s;atisfy'd, That you would not be in a Condition to fix him as well they, becau&s;e they have much more Cunning, and under&s;tand the Affairs of the World much better than you: Let, let the King alone, tho' at the Peril of all our Lives. The good Mother &s;poke the&s;e Words with a great deal of Pa&s;&s;ion, and affording a free Cour&s;e to her Tears, the young Counte&s;s could not refrain to do the &s;ame: She remain'd all this while at her Feet, and were laying over the Matter with a great deal of Vehemency; when the Earls of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> entred the <HI>Grotto.</HI></P>
<P>They were &s;urprized to find them in this Po|&s;ture; the Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> perceived it, and judging rightly, that nothing could prove more prejudicial to her Daughter, than if the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> &s;hould get it into his Head, that &s;he had bin reprimanding her Daughter concern|ing her ill Conduct, e&s;pecially, &s;ince &s;he knew him to have conceived &s;ome Jealou&s;y already, at the Accidental meeting of her Daughter with the King in the Forre&s;t, and that he had told &s;ome hard and reflecting Words to her upon that account; She de&s;ired the Earls of <HI>Angie&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> to give attention to what &s;he was a going to di&s;cover to them: You will, I don't doubt, <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> Commend the Coun|te&s;s
<PB N="83" REF="86">
of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> for her firmne&s;s and &s;incerity: Look here upon this Letter from the King, (&s;he Communicated to me) full of Threats, in ca&s;e &s;he continues to treat him with Indifferency. The Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> took the Letter, a Colour ri&s;ing in his Face, which &s;ufficiently di&s;cover'd his Unea&s;ine&s;s; and being well acquainted with the Character of his Ma&s;ter, had the &s;atisfaction of being an Eye Witne&s;s of his Complaints: He told my Lady <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> he never que&s;tioned his Wives Conduct, knowing the Sincerity and good Inclinations of her Heart; and that it was an Action worthy her&s;elf, to prefer her Duty to all the Airy Ideas of Greatne&s;s. The Earl of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> on his &s;ide, was not able to expre&s;s his &s;atisfaction; The young Coun|te&s;s &s;aid little, but at that Juncture &s;ecretly blamed her&s;elf, for not Sacrificing the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> in the &s;ame manner as &s;he had done the King.</P>
<P>Their Conver&s;ation being over, &s;he retired in|to her Apartment, to tell <HI>Albine</HI> every thing that happened; She fail'd not to give immediate Notice thereof to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who judged, not without great rea&s;on, that the Coun|te&s;s and her Family would now not &s;tay longer in <HI>London,</HI> &s;ince every thing would appear &s;u&s;pi|cious there, and that he mu&s;t prepare for a mo&s;t Cruel Separation: What he had fore&s;een, came &s;oon to pa&s;s; The Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> told his Father-in-law, That, &s;ince the King would not be ea&s;ily repul&s;ed, the be&s;t means to make him to think no more of the Counte&s;s, would be to let her Mother carry her along with her to <HI>Twit|tenham;</HI> and his Advice being fully approved by the Earl of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> every thing nece&s;&s;ary for their Departure was got ready with great &s;e|crecy. In the mean while, the King continuing

to labour under no &s;mall unea&s;ine&s;s, would fain have Vi&s;ited my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> nor would he have delay'd the Matter, had it not bin on ac|count of Madam <HI>Grey,</HI> for whom his Pa&s;&s;ion ga|thered new &s;trength every day; and the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> left nothing undone on his &s;ide, to per|&s;uade the King, that nothing could be more Beau|tiful, nor more fit to be Beloved than her; every Word of hers he Repre&s;ented to the utmo&s;t ad|vantage, and made the nice&s;t Remarks upon what &s;he never &s;aid, nay, what &s;he perhaps never thought of.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> being told by her Mother, that they intended to carry her into the Country, was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly afflicted at this piece of News; She di&s;clo&s;ed her Pain to <HI>Albine,</HI> but forbid her at the &s;ame time to let the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> know of it. But the Treacherous old Governe&s;s having but little regard to her Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Orders, not only di&s;covered the Matter to him, but al&s;o gave him to under&s;tand, that her Mi&s;tre&s;s would not be able to bid him Farewell, unle&s;s &s;ome unfore&s;een Opportunity &s;hould offer it &s;elf. The Earl was ready to run di&s;tracted at this piece of News, and walking very fa&s;t up and down the Room, when the General came in abruptly, looking very heavy and melancholy. Ah! my Lord, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I have heard &s;omething, that much di&s;turbs my Mind; My Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> is to go along with my Lady <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> to <HI>Twittenham,</HI> I have it under her own Hand, but what is wor&s;t of all, is, that there is a &s;u&s;picion of an Inter|view betwixt us; So, that being the occa&s;ion of her Lord's jealou&s;y, and of the &s;everity of her Mother, I am re&s;olved to &s;ee her no more. What a Change of Fortune is this, for a Man who was &s;o very Happy but lately! I Compa&s;&s;ionate you, <HI>reply'd the Earl,</HI> but after all, you are fully a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="85" REF="88">
of being Beloved. That is but a &s;lender Comfort, <HI>reply'd the General.</HI> Perhaps it will not be long before &s;he returns, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> and imagine how acceptable that will prove to you. Rather imagine, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> what I am to &s;uffer during her ab&s;ence: I am to &s;ee her to Morrow to take my leave of her, and this faithful Limner has bin forced to take a great deal of Pains to procure me that happy Moment. The Earl Congratulated him, and his Head being too full to permit him to detain the General by in&s;ignificant que&s;tions, He only told him, That he was as much concerned at this Mi&s;hap as if it were his own, and that he hoped that he would do him &s;o much ju&s;tice, as to believe that he was as &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with it as him&s;elf co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ld be.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as he was at Liberty, he made u&s;e of all his Wit and Charms, which he knew how to make appear in their utmo&s;t Lu&s;tre when he re&s;olved to do it, to per&s;uade the Counte&s;s, That if &s;he departed without permitting him to &s;ee her, he &s;hould infallibly die of Grief. She being mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with the tender and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Expre&s;&s;ions of this Letter would perhaps have bin inclinable enough to afford him this Favour, but knew not how to hazard a thing of that Con&s;equence, in a Hou&s;e which then contained &s;o numerous a Family; She con&s;ulted about the Matter the &s;ame Evening with <HI>Albine.</HI> The old Governe&s;s had &s;carce Patience enough to hear the Counte&s;s putting her in Mind of the Jealou&s;y and Courage of the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and that in ca&s;e the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> &s;hould be di&s;covered, he would be but &s;curvily u&s;ed. <HI>Albine,</HI> I &s;ay, having a greater &s;hare of Avarice than Prudence, <HI>reply'd,</HI> Let the wor&s;t come to the wor&s;t, the Earl might pretend he was &s;ent thither by the King, and &s;o he need not fear any ill u&s;age, &s;ince that would be
<PB N="86" REF="89">
the way to provoke the King to the highe&s;t de|gree. The Counte&s;s did not give her Con&s;ent, without a great deal of Reluctancy, having ob|&s;erved for &s;everal days la&s;t pa&s;t, that they were more jealous of her than formerly, and knowing, that upon the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion, the whole Family would take the Alarm: But, how ea&s;ie is it to overcome a young Woman prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd in the Favour of him &s;he likes! <HI>Albine</HI> promi&s;ed to re|move all ob&s;tacles, adding, That the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> would infallibly die for Grief, if he &s;hould be made &s;en&s;ible of her po&s;itivene&s;s in this point; And there needed no more to convince the Coun|te&s;s, that &s;he might &s;ee him without much dan|ger.</P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily imagine, he would not mi&s;s the A&s;&s;ignation, for though that was to be late at Night, he fail'd not to ri&s;e very early in the Morning, and &s;uch was his impatience, that he thought the day would never be at an end: What did not he &s;ay to the Sun! Every thing a Lover was capable of, in his Amorous Frenzies. He call'd Night a Thou&s;and times to his Aid, and no &s;ooner had the Sky covered it &s;elf with its Black Vail, but wrapt up in a Cloak, and at|tended only by his faithful <HI>Berincour,</HI> he comes to the little Garden Gate, not que&s;tioning but that his new Key, which he had never try'd before, would open it without Trouble: But all this Care and Pains proved fruitle&s;s; for the Key broke in the Lock. What was now to be done after &s;uch a mi&s;hap? Nothing el&s;e but to get over the Wall, or el&s;e to return from whence he came. But, as he would rather have cho&s;en to die in attempting the fir&s;t, than to free him&s;elf from all danger by the la&s;t, &s;o, without he&s;itating upon the Matter, he Clambred up to the top, as he had done once before, and was ju&s;t upon the point
<PB N="87" REF="90">
of leaping into the Garden, when he &s;aw abun|dance of People with Flambeaux, who appear'd as if they were &s;earching after &s;omething. In ef|fect my Lady <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> having lo&s;t the Pourtrai|ture of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>York</HI> &s;he con&s;tantly wore on her Arm had not perceived it till after it was Dark, and having cau&s;ed, but in vain, to &s;earch all the Apartments, &s;he ordered all the Walks of the Garden to be narrowly view'd, for fear the weight of the Gold and Diamonds might make it &s;ink into the Sand.</P>
<P>As all the Dome&s;ticks were not equally intent upon the Matter, &s;ome, who happened to look upwards, perceived the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> ju&s;t ready to leap into the Garden; and not doubting but that he was a Thief cry'd out as fa&s;t as they could. The Earl &s;eeing there was no better way to choo&s;e, than to retire in all ha&s;te; But, his Gen|tleman being at &s;ome di&s;tance, as not imagining he would return &s;o &s;oon, he was forced to get down without his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;o that by a Fall, he Wounded his Arm, in &s;o much, that he thought it had bin broken: But, though it proved ex|ce&s;&s;ive Painful, he made all the ha&s;te he could, to get away from that fatal Place, where he had flat|tred him&s;elf to get Sight of his &s;o dearly Beloved Lady: He walk'd very fa&s;t, and &s;ometimes look|ing behind him, would ask his Gentleman, whe|ther they were pur&s;ued by any body? This being overheard by a certain Per&s;on that pa&s;s'd by accidentally, and he believing them to be Thieves, gave Notice thereof to the Watch, who fell upon, and &s;urrounded them before they could make u&s;e of their Swords to defend them&s;elves. The Leader of the Watch, being a Bruti&s;h Fel|low and Drunk, ask'd the Earl, who he was, from whence he came, and where he intended to go? It was thought fit to return him no an&s;wer,

partly out of di&s;dain, partly out of nece&s;&s;ity not to make a Noi&s;e they being as yet but at a little di&s;tance from the Garden, and they &s;uppo&s;ed, as actually it happened that the Earls of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> knew by this time, there had bin &s;ome body &s;een upon the Wall: Be&s;ides, &s;ome going to take a view of the little Gate of the Garden, and finding a Key broken within the Lock, this cau&s;ed no &s;mall unea&s;ine&s;s in the Fa|mily, and the Matter being canva&s;s'd over and over, the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> di&s;covered &s;omewhat of a Secret Jealou&s;y. The poor Counte&s;s, &s;aw her Projects vani&s;h into Smoak, and the nece&s;&s;ity of departing, rendred her almo&s;t incon&s;olable; Be&s;ides, &s;he dur&s;t not di&s;cover her Trouble, &s;o that, though &s;he conceal'd it as much as &s;he could, yet there appear'd in her Eyes a certain Emotion, which might ea&s;ily have bin ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>But to return to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who finding him&s;elf &s;urrounded by the Watch, thought it his be&s;t way to get rid of them, by be&s;tow|ing a good Handful of Money upon the Leader, not que&s;tioning, but that &s;o he might be di&s;|mi&s;s'd, without being put to the trouble of di&s;covering his Name: He had fill'd his Pockets with Gold Pieces he intended for <HI>Albine;</HI> but mi&s;&s;ing of her, offer'd them to the Leader of the Watch: But his Profu&s;edne&s;s proved mi&s;chievous to him; for this Man, now judging they had com|mitted &s;ome great Robbery, and perceiving him to be Wounded in the Arm, and to be very careful in hiding his Face, was re&s;olved to detain him, it being a Cu&s;tom here, to &s;top and keep in Cu|&s;tody all &s;uch as will not di&s;cover them&s;elves, if they are met by the Watch in the Night time. There are certain Benches fa&s;tned on every Corner of <HI>London</HI> Streets, to the Walls of the Hou&s;es, whereon &s;uch as are taken upon Su&s;pi|cion

are to &s;it, with their Legs put thro' certain Holes made in two Boards, fitted and joyn'd one above the other; a Diver&s;ion not very well agreeing with tho&s;e who are u&s;ed to more conve|nient Seats. The Earl perceiving what Quarters were prepared for him once more took the Head of the Watch a&s;ide, and told him, That if he would not put him into that Place, but let him go, he would entru&s;t him with his Name, and that he was the Earl of <HI>Warwick:</HI> Upon this, the Head Officer, who did not take Notice of his Garter, nor of the Embroidered Star the Knights of that Order always wear upon their Coats, not doubting but that he was an Impo&s;ture, Go, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> did not I &s;u&s;pect thee before to be a Rogue? Thy Impudence to a&s;&s;ume the Name of &s;o Great a Man, fully convinces me of it: And &s;o, without hearkning any further to his Di&s;cour&s;e, he put his Legs into the Stocks, with a Re&s;olution to carry both him and his Gentleman to my Lord <HI>Warwick,</HI> as &s;oon as it &s;hould be day-light.</P>
<P>I give you leave to gue&s;s at the Confu&s;ion he was in upon &s;o odd an Accident. Did ever &s;ince the beginning of the World, <HI>&s;aid he to Berincour,</HI> happen any Adventure like this? I would be tolerably well contented, had I but taken my Leave of the Counte&s;s; but now am &s;o unfortunate, as not to be able to &s;ee her before &s;he is carry'd into the Country: Be&s;ides that, the Wound I have in my Arm will require &s;ome time to be cured; &s;o, that all the unlucky Accidents &s;eems now to center in mine. I defy thee, Ca|pricious Fortune, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> to treat me wor&s;e than thou ha&s;t done. However, after &s;ome &s;hort Re|flections, <HI>added he,</HI> Who is it in all <HI>England</HI> that would not choo&s;e to be in my Place, and be at this very time where I am now, &s;eated upon a
<PB N="90" REF="93">
Bench at the Corner of a Street, with my Legs put through &s;o many Holes, and lock'd clo&s;e within the Boards? And this is the Station, tho&s;e who would wi&s;h them&s;elves in my Place, mu&s;t be in, in &s;pite of them&s;elves: For, I can a&s;&s;ure you, I am here contrary to my Inclinations. My Lord, <HI>&s;aid his Gentleman,</HI> this will be over by Day|light, and he that could be my Lord <HI>Warwick</HI> upon this Condition, would have no ill Bargain of it for the remainder of his Life. I know not what you may think of it, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> as for my Part, I would rather choo&s;e to be a Porter; for he Works all Day, and at Night reli&s;hes the Plea&s;ures of a &s;weet Tranquillity, more than a General after the gaining of a Battel; he has no Ma&s;ter, and con&s;equently is under no con&s;traint of plea&s;ing him; has he a Mi&s;tre&s;s, he goes to &s;ee her with|out controul; he enjoys Health, and is never without a good Appetite; if his Wife's ob&s;trope|rous, he beats her into good Manners; he dreads neither the Great Ones nor the Thieves, his For|tune is always in the &s;ame Station; his Prince knows not whether there be &s;uch a Man upon Earth, and that Place is the be&s;t to him where he can live be&s;t. Now what Compari&s;on is there betwixt &s;uch a Man and a Courtier, &s;uch as I am? Such as you are, my Lord, <HI>cry'd</HI> Berincour, was ever a Man born under a more Fortunate Planet. The King &s;tands indebted to you for his Crown, and all what he can do for you, is below what you have done for him. I am neverthele&s;s to be pity'd at this time, <HI>reply'd the Earl,</HI> and I can't but ad|mire the Capriciou&s;ne&s;s of Fortune; it &s;eems to me as if Caprice and Chance play again&s;t one another for us Mortals, and that they decide our Fate at their own Plea&s;ure. They were thus talk|ing together to divert their Spleen, when they heard not far from thence, &s;ome Body cry out
<PB N="91" REF="94">
Murder, Watch, Help! The Watch Gang, being not far off, run immediately that way, and in a moment after, brought hither a Man who ap|pear'd to be very refractory.</P>
<P>The Earl and his Gentleman, not being over curious to &s;ee him, turn'd away their Faces, be|cau&s;e they were unwilling to be &s;een them&s;elves; but the Head of the Watch, who brought him along, told him, laughing, You will have no rea|&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfy'd with your Company, General <HI>Talbot,</HI> for here is the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and ano|ther Lord, who will be glad of your Conver&s;a|tion; &s;o you may di&s;cour&s;e together of the Court, till Day break, when I &s;hall have the Honour of &s;eeing you again. At the&s;e Words he lock'd his Leggs into the Stocks, and took his Leave of the Three Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Whoever thou art, <HI>&s;aid the Earl of</HI> Warwick <HI>to him,</HI> that ha&s;t occa&s;ion to try the &s;ame Fate with mine, pray tell me, how did'&s;t thou fancy to get out of the Hands of the&s;e Myrmidons? By telling them you were the General <HI>Talbot?</HI> And thou, who art &s;o curious and importunate, <HI>returns he,</HI> what makes thee ask &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable a Que&s;tion, &s;ince thou had'&s;t Confidence enough thy &s;elf to a&s;&s;ume the Name of the Earl of <HI>Warwick?</HI> The Earl was &s;o well pleas'd with this An&s;wer, that he could not refrain from laughing, and his Laughter having &s;omething in it that was pe|culiar and ea&s;ie to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd. I now am &s;en&s;ible, <HI>continued the Per&s;on that &s;poke before,</HI> why thou did'&s;t make U&s;e of his Name, becau&s;e thou laughe&s;t very like him. Thou art in the right on't, <HI>&s;aid my Lord Warwick,</HI> I have bin often flattered, that I was like him, and at a Pinch one lays hold of every thing: But, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> tho' thou did'&s;t act by the &s;ame Motives as I did, pray tell me, What made thee imagine thou could'&s;t get
<PB N="92" REF="95">
off by taking upon thee the Name of General <HI>Talbot,</HI> becau&s;e there was not the lea&s;t Probability in this Pretence&punc; I made u&s;e of the fir&s;t Name that came into my Head, <HI>reply'd the other.</HI> I am &s;orry, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> you did not pitch upon that of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> as well as my &s;elf, that we might have &s;een who had the be&s;t Title to it. The other Pri&s;oner made no further An&s;wer, and the Earl only &s;aid with a low Voice to his Gentl|eman, That when the Watch came by the next time, they would try once more whether they could get out of this trouble&s;ome Place.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were Di&s;cour&s;ing together, their Brother-in-affection, who having bin over-heated, and now had had time enough to cool him&s;elf, began to Cough mo&s;t violently. The Earl heard him not without &s;ome Surprize: If I have the Laughter of the Earl of <HI>Warwick, &s;aid he,</HI> I am &s;ure thou ha&s;t General <HI>Talbot</HI>'s Cough. Doe&s;t thou know him well enough, to be a Judge of that, reply'd the Man with the Cough&punc; No Man that has bin a Soldier can be mi&s;taken in that point, <HI>&s;aid the Earl.</HI> They were thus talking to|gether, when the Watch pa&s;&s;ing by, they call'd to them, to de&s;ire to be conducted to their re&s;pective Places of abode. You are a Company of Rogues, <HI>&s;aid their Leader,</HI> you are likely to &s;tay here till Day-light; but fearing le&s;t &s;omething &s;hould be defective in the Lock of the Boards wherein their Leggs were enclo&s;ed, he view'd it narrowly with his Lanthorn. At this in&s;tant the Pri&s;oners ca&s;t|ing their Eyes about, knew one another, to their utmo&s;t &s;urprize on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>The Watch being gone, they both gave a great Cry at the &s;ame time, and taking each other by the Hand, How! Is it you? How! Is it you, <HI>&s;aid they:</HI> What happened to me, <HI>added the General,</HI> is pa&s;t all belief; were we alone, I would ea&s;e my

&s;elf in telling you my Adventure. You may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> that the third Per&s;on here, is both Deaf and Dumb, when ever I think fit; and that is enough to &s;ecure you again&s;t any thing from him. I am &s;o impatient to relate it to you, <HI>reply'd the General,</HI> that upon your Word I am a going to tell you the whole Story.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'You are not unacquainted with that Pa&s;&s;ion I have bin entangled in for &s;ome time pa&s;s'd, I, I &s;ay, who had kept my &s;elf free from it, all my Life time before: I was not &s;en&s;ible of the Effects it would produce in my Heart, and con|&s;equently &s;o little feared the Con&s;equences there|of, that I cheri&s;h'd it as my greate&s;t Happine&s;s. 'Tis true, the Ob&s;tacles I met with to &s;ee the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> appear'd to me &s;o full of Difficulty and Trouble, that I was re&s;olv'd to cure and de&s;pi&s;e my Frailty: But this unfortu|nate Painter, having in &s;ome mea&s;ure dived into my true Sentiments, and found by Experience, that a Per&s;on of my Temper, was the fitte&s;t Object of encrea&s;ing his Fortune, came to me, to facilitate, as he &s;aid, every thing for an Inter|view betwixt the Counte&s;s and my &s;elf. I ac|cepted his Offer, and it was agreed he &s;hould come in a Coach to my Back-gate: I went in|to it, without any Attendance, being a&s;ham'd my Dome&s;ticks &s;hould have the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of my Extravagancy. He Conducted me into a Beautiful Garden, and thence into a <HI>Grotto,</HI> where I &s;aw the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire;</HI> &s;o full of Tenderne&s;s, Frankne&s;s and Mode&s;ty, that being &s;eized with the mo&s;t profound Re&s;pect for her Per&s;on, I thought my &s;elf only too Happy: She would afford me no other Favours than the Satisfaction of Seeing, and Sighing for her, and I in&s;i&s;ted upon no more; for I de&s;pi&s;e all Women that &s;uffer them&s;elves to be
<PB N="94" REF="97">
withdrawn from their Duty: And not with|&s;tanding that heighth of Pa&s;&s;ion I had con|ceived for her, I &s;hould have &s;hewn nothing but Aver&s;ion to her; It having at all times bin my Opinion, that Vertue and Mode&s;ty are the E&s;&s;ential Parts of a Good Woman. She que|&s;tionle&s;s had bin acquainted with my Temper, and therefore always kept her&s;elf within &s;uch &s;trict Bounds, that &s;he would never allow me the Liberty of touching as much as her Hand, unle&s;s when I put &s;ome Rings with Precious Stones upon her Fingers: When I &s;poke to my Limner, concerning her Re&s;ervedne&s;s, he told me, in his Country the Ladies were much more Cruel, and to &s;peak of an <HI>Italian</HI> Woman, and of a Tyger, was the &s;ame thing. I was not good Natur'd enough, to be like him, but gave him the hearing: But, to be &s;hort, my Lord, you know I told you this Morning, that I was to take my leave of her to Night, ac|cordingly I went to the <HI>Grotto,</HI> attended by by my old Guide, where I found the Counte&s;s; but in a Moment after, &s;aw come in an antient Man, follow'd by Four lu&s;ty Young Men well Arm'd; The Father, without taking any No|tice of me, turning to his Daughter, Unfor|tunate Woman, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> What could engage thee to Di&s;honour our Family by thy ill Con|duct? Art not thou Treated both by thy Mother and my &s;elf, with all the Tenderne&s;s thou could&s;t expect under thy Circum&s;tances? Thy Life &s;hall Pay for the Shame thou ha&s;t made us undergo, with this, drawing his Dagger, gave her a Stab, before I could put it by, though I had my Sword drawn; but I Wounded one of the young Fellows who A&s;&s;aulted me. I &s;aw my &s;elf immediately Surrounded by the Father and the other three, &s;o that I found my &s;elf engag'd at great odds,
<PB N="95" REF="98">
and for whom, I give you leave to Gue&s;s, to wit, for an incon&s;iderable Jilt, who &s;o nearly re&s;embled the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> that, to find out the real difference betwixt them, one mu&s;t be undeceived in the &s;ame manner as I was. I thought it therefore my be&s;t way to think of Retreating, and I can't tell, whether they knew me or not; But certain it is, they were not very pre&s;&s;ing upon me, to hinder my Re|treat. Thus, I had come off well enough, had it not bin for two Old Women, who, being brought thither by the Noi&s;e, pur&s;ued me &s;o clo&s;ely with their out-cries, that the Watch heard it. I happened to meet them at the Corner of a Street, which I cro&s;s'd with much ha&s;te, tho' I knew not where I was: For, my Rogui&s;h <HI>Italian,</HI> who &s;tood Centry for me, was run a|way, and in all probability, will never appear no more in <HI>London,</HI> after the Game he has play'd me. But be that as it will; I &s;oon &s;aw my &s;elf be&s;et on all &s;ides by the Watch, and having not much time to con&s;ider how to an&s;wer tho&s;e que&s;tions they commonly put to tho&s;e they meet in the Night time, I thought it the &s;horte&s;t way, to be plain with them, <HI>I am &s;uch a one;</HI> What a cry did they not &s;et up at my Name! I know the time, when to ingratiate them&s;elves with General <HI>Talbot,</HI> they wou'd al|mo&s;t pre&s;s me to Death; and you may now &s;ee, that in the Place where I am, they have al|mo&s;t done &s;o in good earne&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>The Earl would have bin much more Surpriz'd than now he was at this Recital, had he not known beforehand, that this Woman being a Suppo&s;ititious Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> the unra|velling of this Intrigue was not likely to hap|pen without Noi&s;e: So that being actually pre|pared again&s;t any Surprize, he pretended ne|verthele&s;s
<PB N="96" REF="99">
he was, and acted his Part to the greate&s;t nicety. If you will follow my Advice, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I would have you endeavour to cure your &s;elf of a Pa&s;&s;ion, which has &s;erved hitherto only to tor|ment you, and to impair that Great Cha|racter unto which you were born. 'Tis certain, <HI>&s;aid the General,</HI> I was not made for the&s;e &s;orts of Amu&s;ements; I am &s;o much a&s;ham'd of it, that &s;hould any Body el&s;e but your &s;elf, my Lord, be acquainted with my Frailties, I &s;hould not be able to endure it. You may therefore believe, that I &s;hall not &s;eek to nouri&s;h tho&s;e Flames I &s;o much de&s;pi&s;e. As good fortune will have it, the true Counte&s;s is a going into the Country; I am &s;ure I will not go to meet her by the Way: And it &s;hall not be my fault, if ever I &s;ee her again. But, <HI>continued he,</HI> What Chance drew you into this Ambu&s;h? I need not tell you, <HI>reply'd the Earl,</HI> you may be &s;ure it was an A&s;&s;ignation. Well, at lea&s;t, <HI>added the General,</HI> I hope you &s;aw the Party you look'd for? No, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> and am, be|&s;ides that, much Wounded in the Arm. So we have both &s;ufficient cau&s;e of Di&s;&s;atisfaction, <HI>reply'd the General:</HI> But I wi&s;h I was &s;o far a Conjurer as to gue&s;s at the Subject, and to tell in what Place we now are? As to what relates to my &s;elf, <HI>re|ply'd the Earl,</HI> there needs no Conjurer, who deals with Hell or the Devil; 'Tis known to every Body long ago, that I am much addicted to Adventures. Don't you remember, what happened to the King and my &s;elf, whil&s;t he was yet Earl of <HI>Marche?</HI> One &s;weet Night above all the re&s;t being taken up by the Watch, we were forc'd to tell our Names, but they had too much ill Nature to believe us; &s;o they would needs carry us to the very Lodgings of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>York,</HI> who, tho' &s;he was a&s;leep, the&s;e Bea&s;ts would needs &s;peak with her: Here,
<PB N="97" REF="100">
Madam, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> take your Son, and keep him at home; for if we meet him again, we &s;hall not bring him hither. I remember the thing, <HI>&s;aid the General,</HI> and know this is not your Noviate, tho' I confe&s;s it is altogether a Novelty to me; and &s;hould be &s;orry to the Heart, if a Burle&s;que Account &s;hould be given of a thing which is &s;uffi|ciently ridiculous in it &s;elf, and in which I have bin engaged in good earne&s;t. Let this matter happen as it will, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> it will do you no harm.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were thus talking the time away, Day-Light began to di&s;perce the Darkne&s;s of the Night, and this increa&s;ing their impatience of &s;eeing them&s;elves reliev'd from &s;o ill a Po&s;t, they were ready to break their Leggs in trying how to get them out. The Watch happen'd to come ju&s;t in the nick of time, under the &s;ame Leader, but attended by another &s;et of Watchmen, being up|on the point of parting: Among the&s;e there hap|pen'd to be two, who knowing both the General and the Earl very well, were ready to drop down for fear, having &s;carce &s;trength enough left, to let the Head of the Watch know the fault he had committed: The fellow turn'd Pale, like one that had receiv'd Sentence of Death, and threw him&s;elf at their Feet. The two Earls, &s;eeing him almo&s;t de&s;perate, told him, He &s;hould be &s;atisfy'd, and take care to open the Lock of the Boards that kept in their Legs, and that without any lo&s;s of time. The poor Fellow was &s;o much frightned, that he neither under&s;tood them, nor remember'd what he had done with the Key; at la&s;t it was found, and that in the very nick of time, &s;ince otherwi&s;e they had bin catch'd in that Place by the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>This Lord more di&s;turb'd by his Jealou&s;y, than eas'd by &s;leep, had not bin in Bed all that Night,
<PB N="98" REF="101">
under pretence of giving the nece&s;&s;ary Orders for their Journey: Thus he pa&s;s'd the greate&s;t part of the Night in a very Ill Humour, and rais'd his Mother-in-law and Wife &s;o early out of their Beds, that they pa&s;s'd through the &s;ame Street, where the General and the Earl had had their Quarters, within a few Minutes after they were di&s;mi&s;s'd. The Head of the Watch was &s;till &s;itting upon the &s;ame Bench, tearing his Hair like a Mad|man. The Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> compa&s;&s;ionating his Condition, &s;topp'd the Coach, and call'd to him; but he refu&s;ing to come near them, &s;he de|&s;ir'd the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> who was on Hor&s;e|back along with them, to &s;peak to him, &s;ince &s;he thought &s;he knew him, for he kept the Watch not far from their Hou&s;e. Having a little recover'd him&s;elf, he related to the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> what Misfortune had befall'n him; <HI>&s;aying,</HI> He look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d up|on him&s;elf as lo&s;t for ever, and that he was re|&s;olv'd to go out of <HI>England.</HI> The Earl could not give Credit to &s;o &s;trange an Adventure; and what render'd it quite incredible to him, was, that General <HI>Talbot</HI> was mention'd in it, whom he be|liev'd to be much wi&s;er than to ramble in the Streets in the Night with the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> &s;o that he look'd upon the Fellow as Frenzical. He told his Opinion to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> who thought the &s;ame; but the young Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> knew too well how the matter lay: Her Grief encreas'd to a high degree, when &s;he under&s;tood what had happen'd to the Earl, and e&s;pecially his being Wounded in the Arm: She endeavour'd, but in vain, to conceal it; but you might have read in her Eyes, the Secret Thoughts of her Heart. Her Mother ask'd her, what was the matter? She told her &s;he was very ill; and &s;he being &s;uppos'd to be then with Child, there was no further enquiry made at that time.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="102">
The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> had much ado to get home; his Leggs were much crampt, and his Arm full of Pain, but his wor&s;t Di&s;temper lay in the Head and Mind. He much fear'd that &s;ome of the Watchmen would talk of this Accident, and that thus the whole Mi&s;tery might be unfolded, which it was his utmo&s;t intere&s;t to keep conceal'd. The General <HI>Talbot</HI> had a thou&s;and <HI>Chimera</HI>'s to &s;truggle withal; and be|ing re&s;olv'd not to make any one the Confident of his Troubles, he kept the whole clo&s;ed up within his own Brea&s;t: However, he &s;aw him&s;elf freed from the Fetters of the Counte&s;s, and this Pa&s;&s;ion had bin &s;ufficiently tormenting to him not to reli&s;h the &s;weet of this new Tranquility. In the mean while, the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> took the departure of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> &s;o far to Heart, that he was forc'd to keep his Bed: But what prov'd a great Addition to his Grief, was, that putting his Hand into his Pocket, to feel for a Jewel he had, he found it not; he gue&s;s'd he mu&s;t either have lo&s;t it, or el&s;e it was &s;toln out of his Pocket; but however it happen'd, he was al|mo&s;t de&s;perate about it; he order'd <HI>Berincour</HI> to leave no Stone unturn'd to find it out, and in the mean while continu'd to be almo&s;t beyond him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The King was no &s;ooner ri&s;en, but he ask'd for the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> &s;o they went to fetch him; but being told he had a Feaver, the King, who lov'd him extreamly, was not long before he gave him a Vi&s;it in his Lodgings. He had already bin inform'd of the departure of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> by <HI>Albine,</HI> whereat being mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly afflicted, he wanted to talk with the Earl about it. At la&s;t, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> they have carry'd away the Counte&s;s: I am &s;urpriz'd at my &s;elf, I &s;hould re|lent her Lo&s;s, after the U&s;age I have receiv'd from
<PB N="100" REF="103">
her! and therefore am apt to believe, 'tis not her Per&s;on, &s;o much as the &s;atisfaction of revenging my &s;elf, which I regret at pre&s;ent. Forget her, Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Earl in a Langui&s;hing Tone,</HI> &s;he is unworthy of your Tenderne&s;s, and I am &s;en&s;ible &s;he will be &s;ufficiently puni&s;h'd in the Country, for her Incon&s;tancy in <HI>London.</HI> That does not &s;atisfy me, <HI>added the King,</HI> I will know, what it was that made her u&s;e me at that rate. You had better &s;tay for her return, <HI>reply'd the Earl,</HI> your Maje&s;ty knows then what to do be&s;t. This delay not &s;uiting the King's impatient Temper, and Anger, he was &s;ometimes for making her to come back again; in a Moment after, for going to &s;ee her; and after all, he was for &s;ending his Favourite thither; but &s;oon changing his Mind again, he was &s;truggling with the&s;e different Thoughts for &s;everal Days. Madam <HI>Grey</HI> was not in&s;en&s;ible of this Di&s;traction of his Mind, and &s;he was &s;uffici|ently inclin'd to make her Complaints to him, but was afraid of checking the King's Pa&s;&s;ion, and that being us'd to &s;ee her in Tears &s;o often, he might not regard them for the future; &s;he was of Opinion, that nothing could be of more dange|rous Con&s;equence to a Mi&s;tre&s;s; and that an un|faithful Lover, who takes care to conceal his In|fidelity, is more likely to return to his former Pa&s;&s;ion, than one who quite breaks off upon that Score: Be&s;ides, that the Earl, who had all along animated her Anger, was not now &s;o pre&s;&s;ing up|on that Point: For he fear'd no more the King's Progre&s;s in this Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ince the departure of my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire;</HI> and now employ'd all his care in &s;ettling his own.</P>
<P>What Di&s;turbances did he not meet with in his Heart, when he con&s;ider'd &s;he was not to come back in a con&s;iderable time! and that there was not the lea&s;t Opportunity of &s;eeing her, but

<P>After the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> had left the Head-Watchman before mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d, he travell'd imme|diately forward to a Wood, through which they mu&s;t pa&s;s to <HI>Twittenham;</HI> here alighting from his Hor&s;e, he gave it to a little Page that attended him, whil&s;t he walk'd along the great Road with a &s;low Pace ruminating upon the Thief that had bin &s;een upon the Wall, the broken Key in the Little Garden-gate, and at la&s;t upon the Fancy of the Head-Watchman, who believ'd he had taken up the Earls of <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">op.</HI> If he had mention'd only the fir&s;t, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I would not in the lea&s;t que&s;tion it; but the la&s;t of the&s;e two has more Wit than to be catch'd in &s;o odd an Adventure. As he was frequently looking about to &s;ee whether his Mother-in-law's Coach follow'd him, he ob&s;erv'd &s;omething that ca&s;t a more than ordinary Lu&s;tre in his Page's Hands: Drawing nearer to him he &s;aw it was a large Jewel of Gold, &s;et all over with precious Stones, a Piece he had often &s;een in the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s Hands: He enquir'd, not without &s;ome di&s;turbance, from the Page, where he had it? He told him frankly
<PB N="102" REF="105">
That he being one of the fir&s;t who got into the Street, after the Thief had bin &s;een upon the Wall, the Lu&s;tre of this Piece, made of Gold, and cover'd with Diamonds, had made him look that way, and perceiving what it was, he thought he might take and keep it. The Earl took it, and looking upon it for a con&s;iderable time, it at la&s;t &s;eem'd to him of that thickne&s;s as to contain a double Bottom; he try'd to open it, with a &s;ort of unea&s;ine&s;s, whereof he already began to &s;u&s;pect the cau&s;e, and being gone at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Page, at la&s;t open'd and found enclos'd within it, the Picture of his Lady, with the&s;e Words Engraven round about it, <HI>She is much better in my Heart.</HI></P>
<P>At this fatal Sight he turn'd Pale, he &s;hiver'd, his Soul was expos'd a Prey to the mo&s;t cruel Reflections that could be: He lov'd my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> he was &s;ometimes inclin'd to ju&s;tify her, but could not accompli&s;h it: For, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of this Jewel mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be the &s;ame Per&s;on, who having got a Key to the Little-Gate of the Garden, was endeavouring to open it; but finding it broken in the Lock, &s;caladed the Wall, and afterwards run away; and the Jewel more than &s;ufficiently &s;hews it mu&s;t be the Earl of <HI>Warwick.</HI> What could he think after &s;o many convincing Proofs, e&s;pecially &s;ince the Picture of his Lady fell into his Hands by &s;o extraordinary an Accident? He was a going to abandon him&s;elf quite to De&s;pair, when hearing the Noi&s;e of my Lady <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI>'s Coach, he Re-mount|ed his Hor&s;e, and &s;poke only a few Words as they pa&s;s'd by him, being re&s;olv'd to hide his Grief, till he had Di&s;cours'd her about the Matter. The little Page vex'd to the Heart, that his Ma&s;ter had kept the Jewel, could not forbear to &s;peak of it to <HI>Albine,</HI> who&s;e Kin&s;man he was, and he extoll'd to &s;uch a

&s;aw her Picture within the Jewel, &s;he could no longer hear, with patience, her Mother upbraiding her with having pre&s;ented it to the Earl; &s;he fell out into &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;poke upon that Head with &s;o much vehemency (tho' without lo&s;ing the re&s;pect due to her Mother) that &s;he began to be fully convinc'd of her Innocence. My Lady <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> now fully &s;atisfy'd of the Truth of what her Daughter had told her, promis'd to omit nothing that might conduce to make the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> to have a favourable Opinion of her. The Counte&s;s begg'd with Tears in her Eyes to do her what &s;ervice &s;he could with her Lord; &s;he was &s;everal times in a Mind to de&s;ire the favour of her to di&s;mi&s;s <HI>Albine;</HI> but fearing le&s;t this malicious old Creature might &s;till more ex|a&s;perate the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> again&s;t her, by putting into his Head certain Malicious Con|&s;tructions concerning her Ea&s;ine&s;s, in con&s;enting to an Interview with him, during her Father's and Husband's Journey to <HI>York,</HI> and con&s;equently make the Breach wider; this prov'd the only Motive, that made her keep near her a Mon&s;ter, which could not be kept at too great a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>My Lady <HI>Angel&s;ey</HI> not only urg'd the matter home, and with extraodinary &s;trength of Rea&s;on, to her Son-in law, but al&s;o engag'd her Word for his Wives Innocence; all the Fault being laid upon the King. And it was true in effect, that my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> knew nothing of the Mi&s;tery of this Jewel-ca&s;e, and that no Body could have &s;hew'd more Di&s;&s;atisfaction, than &s;he did at the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> upon that Point: For, &s;he would often &s;ay to <HI>Albine,</HI> What mu&s;t the Limner think who drew this Picture? he will certainly believe this Favour was obtain'd with my Con&s;ent.

him, whom I am not able to forget: <HI>Albine,</HI> how unfortunate am I! She cry'd for a con&s;iderable time, and her Governe&s;s, who long'd for nothing more than to be always managing an Intrigue whereby &s;he might make her Advantage, did not fail to make U&s;e of this Critical Juncture, to pro|po&s;e to her, to give an Account in a Letter, to the Earl, in what a Condition &s;he was in. The Counte&s;s not only rejected her Propo&s;ition; but al&s;o forbid her ever to re-call to her Mind an Idea, &s;he intended to efface out of her Remem|brance.</P>
<P>The Departure of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> had at fir&s;t rais'd the King's Anger; but hearing her &s;carce ever &s;poken of, and believing him&s;elf not well us'd, he made all his Addre&s;&s;es to Madam <HI>Grey,</HI> who became &s;o intoxicated and haughty at this unexpected return of the King's Pa&s;&s;ion, that, without the lea&s;t Regard to her be&s;t Friends, &s;he &s;acrific'd every thing to her own Humour and In|tere&s;t; as among the re&s;t it happen'd to the Earl of <HI>Warwick.</HI></P>
<P>The Head of the Watch-men, who had made the Earl to pa&s;s his time &s;o &s;curvily in the late Nocturnal Adventure, dreaded the Con&s;equence thereof might turn to his utter Ruin, unle&s;s he could counter-ballance the Earl's Authority, by &s;ome powerful Protection at Court: His Si&s;ter, happening to live with Madam <HI>Grey,</HI> he told her the whole Story, and what Apprehen&s;ions he was under; And this young Woman fearing no le&s;s than the Ruin of her Brother, by the great Power of the General and the Earl, threw her &s;elf at her Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Feet, conjuring her to take Compa&s;&s;ion of her Family, and to interceed with the King, in behalf of what had happen'd to her Brother out of Ignorance. Madam <HI>Grey</HI> was too well pleas'd with this Story, not to impart it to
<PB N="109" REF="112">
the young King, and to repre&s;ent the whole, un|der &s;uch Circum&s;tances of her own Invention, as prov'd very diverting to him. After having laugh'd very heartily for &s;ome time, he was very curious to know from whence the Gene|ral and the Earl came at that time of Night; and as he knew the fir&s;t to be a Per&s;on of down|right Hone&s;ty, he judg'd, he might with much le&s;s Difficulty unfold the Mi&s;tery by him, than by the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who would be &s;ure not to di&s;cover his Intrigue to him.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the King &s;aw the General, he took him into his Clo&s;et, and told him with a very o|bliging Air, That he was &s;omewhat di&s;&s;atisfy'd with him, becau&s;e he &s;hould keep him in Igno|rance, of what was known to all the World be|&s;ides, <HI>viz.</HI> his Quarrel with the Watch: If you have a mind to make your Peace with me, <HI>con|tinued he,</HI> you mu&s;t deal frankly, and let me know, at lea&s;t, from whence you came at that time. Sir, <HI>reply'd the General,</HI> your Maje&s;ty would have put me to the greate&s;t Nonplus that can be, had you ask'd me &s;uch a Que&s;tion as this &s;ometime ago; but at this time, now I have broken tho&s;e Chains that prov'd too weighty for me, and am freed from a Tyrannical Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o little &s;uitable to my Natural Inclinations, I am free to own, that the mo&s;t &s;urprizing Beauty of the young Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> did rob me of the true U&s;e of all my Rea&s;on. He then, like a blunt true-bred Soldier, laid open before the King his whole Pa&s;&s;ion for that Lady, his Inquietudes, and how he had bin manag'd by the Limner; but di&s;|&s;embled his Knowledge of the King's being his Rival, judging, that in point of Policy, he ought not to touch upon that String. The King inter|rupting him, told him with a Smile, Oh! my Lord, you forget to remember me in this Love

Well, let that be as it will, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> tell me whether the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was along with you at this charming A&s;&s;ignation? No, Sir, <HI>&s;aid the General,</HI> we were both equally &s;urpriz'd to meet one ano|ther at this pretty Seat; nay, we talk'd together for &s;ome Moments without knowing one ano|ther, and I could, with all the eagerne&s;s I &s;hew'd, not get out of him a Reciprocal Confi|dence, to tell me from whence he came.</P>
<P>The King, who li&s;ten'd to him with much At|tention, began to conceive &s;ome Jealou&s;y at the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> but would not give way to it, for fear of giving to him&s;elf &s;ome real occa&s;ion of Trouble: His Tenderne&s;s for the Earl did

&s;uppre&s;s his Jealou&s;y, and he would even have bin di&s;&s;atisfy'd with being inform'd of the real Truth thereof; &s;o that his mind fluctuating, be|twixt uncertain Hope and Fear, he did not in the lea&s;t alter his obliging manner of Corre|&s;pondence with this Favorite. But the Earl, who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion encreas'd in Proportion to the Multitude of Ob&s;tacles that ob&s;tructed his Hap|pine&s;s, could think of nothing el&s;e than how to encompa&s;s another Interview with the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire;</HI> and as he took but little notice of tho&s;e that came to make their Court to him, &s;o the King found him much different in his Temper, from that Plea&s;ant, Charming and Engaging Humour, which render'd, him &s;o a|greeable to all the World: He ob&s;erv'd, not without Vexation, that not only his Deport|ment, but al&s;o his Per&s;on, was much chang'd; That his Spirits &s;eem'd &s;uppre&s;s'd; That his Health was but in an indifferent State; and in &s;hort, That his Pen&s;ivene&s;s and Di&s;tractions carry'd him beyond him&s;elf &s;ometimes, pa&s;t all recovery. He was heartily di&s;turb'd thereat, and it came more than once into his Thoughts, that perhaps the Earl might have bin wanting in the Re&s;pect and Fidelity due to him, in re&s;pect of my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and that he &s;ecretly lov'd her: But, as I told you before, he would check the&s;e Con&s;iderations, and continue to give him &s;uch Demon&s;trations of his Tenderne&s;s, as would have made him e&s;teem him&s;elf infinitely Happy, had his Heart not bin engag'd &s;o far as it was.</P>
<P>One Day, when the King had bin Talking to him a long while, concerning a Matter that ac|quir'd a great deal of Attention, being the Sub|ject upon which he was to make a Speech to the Parliament; the better to help his Memory, he

thought fit to dictate it to the Earl, for him to write it; but happening to &s;top at certain Inter|vals, the better to think upon what he was to dictate upon that Head, the Earl, who was &s;o far from thinking upon what the King &s;aid, that he minded nothing el&s;e but his own Affairs, meaning the Counte&s;s, was on a &s;udden &s;eiz'd with &s;ome Splenetick Thoughts, which nearly affecting his Soul, he, without con&s;idering that the Paper he had in his Hand mu&s;t be perus'd by the King him&s;elf, writ the&s;e following Words: Hymen <HI>has reduc'd you under the Laws of a Husband, your Heart is his, and 'tis not in your Power to lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e a Lover.</HI> He had que&s;tionle&s;s gone on, had not the King begun afre&s;h; &s;o that the Earl making a new Article, writ what was dictated to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">; and &s;topping again for a while, to ruminate up|on the Matter, and to render his Speech the more per&s;ua&s;ive and in&s;inuating, the Earl, who was quite taken up with the Counte&s;s, writ again the&s;e Lines: <HI>Love not a Husband who&s;e dreadful Power, does &s;natch from thee thy Heart in &s;pite of thy &s;elf, and who without con&s;ulting thy Heart, offers Violence to thy Inclinations.</HI></P>
<P>The King concluded the Speech which the Earl writ, without con&s;idering it was upon the &s;ame Paper, where he had &s;et down the&s;e Ver&s;es, and it being late, his Maje&s;ty folding it up without reading it, and putting it up in his Pocket, went to pay a Vi&s;it to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>York,</HI> his Mother.

<P>You &s;ee Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> how every thing agrees to what I tell you: He thinks the Counte&s;s loves her Husband; That he fears he &s;hall never obtain her; That this touches him to the Heart, and, That, thereupon he has &s;carce any regard to what your Maje&s;ty dictated to him; but over|come by his Pa&s;&s;ion, he writes tho&s;e very things, he had much better have kept &s;ecret, and that upon the &s;ame Paper you have now in your Hands; nay, you &s;ee him carry'd to &s;uch a Pitch of Extrava|gancy, that he goes on and Writes the&s;e Lines:<Q>Love not a Husband who&s;e dreadful Power, does &s;natch from thee thy Heart in &s;pite of thy &s;elf, and who without con&s;ulting thy Heart, offers Violence to thy Incli|nations.</Q></P>

the King, who &s;oon perceiving that his Jealou&s;y was ill-grounded, and this his Jealou&s;y changing to a mo&s;t furious Anger, continu'd all this while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> a deep &s;tudy. Madam <HI>Grey</HI> being too well acquainted with the cau&s;e thereof to interrupt him in his Thoughts, kept &s;ilence for a while, till the King broke out on a &s;udden, as if he was &s;peaking to the Earl. <HI>O! Perfidious Man! Is this the Return thou make&s;t me for all the Kindne&s;s I have &s;hown thee! for the entire Confidence I have put in thee! for the Riches and other Favours I have heap'd upon thee! What a Piece of Treachery is this? He has &s;natch'd from me a young Mi&s;tre&s;s! whom I lov'd, and unto whom I was not altogether indifferent. He has left no Stone unturn'd, Madam, to rob me likewi&s;e of your Heart: Could any Letters be more cunningly devis'd than the&s;e he has written to you? How Mi&s;erable is the Condition of Princes! being either hated out of Fear, or el&s;e de&s;pis'd when they enter into a Familiarity with their Subjects; &s;o that they &s;carce ever ta&s;te the true Reli&s;h of thinking them&s;elves really belov'd.</HI></P>
<P>He paus'd at the&s;e Words a little, and his Me|lancholly Reflections encrea&s;ing with the Con&s;ide|rations of what Favours he had be&s;tow'd upon the Earl, and how ill he had bin rewarded by him, he Sigh'd, much di&s;&s;atisfy'd within him&s;elf, for retaining &s;till &s;ome Kindne&s;s for a Per&s;on that de|&s;erv'd it &s;o little. At la&s;t turning his Eyes, with a tender Look, upon Madam <HI>Grey,</HI> he begg'd of her not to remember what he had told her, during the fir&s;t Motions of his Jealou&s;y; &s;he appear'd &s;atisfy'd thereat, but was not a little di&s;compos'd at the King's Melancholly, which &s;he endeavour'd to di&s;per&s;e by her plea&s;ant and engaging Conver|&s;ation, which at any other time, but this, would have bin very diverting to him, but now had but little, if not a contrary Effect upon him; for he
<PB N="118" REF="121">
took his Leave of her, not without &s;ome di&s;&s;atis|faction, becau&s;e &s;he had laid open to him the ill Conduct of his Favourite.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> appear'd not at Court that Night, being wholly taken up with making the nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;po&s;itions for <HI>Berincour</HI>'s Journey; he open'd no le&s;s than three times, the Letter he was to deliver to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> making every time certain Additions, and &s;o many &s;uper|fluous Repetitions, as took away a great part of its fir&s;t Beauty. He al&s;o &s;ent a Letter to <HI>Albine,</HI> and a Jewel of a good Value, and yet after all, was not contented with what he had either written or done, fearing le&s;s &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter Ac|cident or other &s;hould di&s;concert all his Precau|tions, or that the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> might be exa&s;perated at his Proceeding.</P>
<P>The King pa&s;s'd that Night under a thou&s;and Inquietudes, which would not &s;uffer him &s;o much as to think of &s;leeping; the Beauty, Grace, and Engaging Air of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> com|ing a fre&s;h into his Mind, tormented his Soul with an irre&s;i&s;table Power: He under&s;tood by the Ver&s;es of the Earl's, that he had not as yet made any &s;ufficient Progre&s;s there to make him Happy; and on the other Hand, reflecting upon his late Conduct, he had all the rea&s;on to fear he &s;hould not be more Happy him&s;elf. Entangled in the&s;e different Con&s;iderations, his Pa&s;&s;ion at la&s;t gave place to his Anger, on account of the Earl of <HI>Warwick:</HI> He took a Re&s;olution to Bani&s;h him into the mo&s;t <HI>Northern Parts</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> among tho&s;e dreadful Mountains, where the Inhabitants (at that time) were di&s;tingui&s;hable only from Savage Bea&s;ts by their Human Shape. <HI>Here it is,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>where he &s;hall entertain the Rocks with his Pa&s;&s;ion; here he &s;hall &s;end forth his Sighs to the Sea, whil&s;t I will remain Deaf to all his Complaints, till I have</HI>

<HI>made him to do a long Penance for his Infidelity.</HI> But after all, con&s;idering the many Obligations he ow'd him, this oblig'd him to alter his Opinion, and to make him acknowledge only, and repent of his Fault. However, whil&s;t he continu'd &s;trug|gling betwixt Gratitude and Anger, for fear the la&s;t &s;hould again get the upper hand again&s;t a Per|&s;on whom he was inclin'd to Pardon, if he would in the lea&s;t render him&s;elf worthy of it, he re&s;olv'd, rather than to &s;peak to him him&s;elf, to engage &s;ome Body el&s;e to do it in his behalf.</P>
<P>He pitch'd upon the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> to under|take this Task: He was al&s;o the King's Favourite, a Man not inferior in Point of Magnificence and Gallantry to any Per&s;on at Court; he was Witty, of a Charming Conver&s;ation, Young, Hand&s;ome, and who &s;par'd nothing to render him&s;elf agree|able to the Fair Sex, and that with good Suc|ce&s;s. The King having order'd him to be call'd to Court early in the Morning, he was yet in Bed, but made all the ha&s;te he could, being impatient to know what the King had to command him. He was no &s;ooner admitted into his Bed Chamber, but he told him. Your be&s;t Friend has betray'd me; The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> never merited the Tenderne&s;s I &s;hew'd him; I made him a Partaker in my Heart, but my Favours were very ill be|&s;tow'd. The Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> hearken'd to the King with a great deal of Trouble, becau&s;e he entirely lov'd the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> What is it you tell me, Sir, <HI>cry'd he?</HI> Is it po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be wanting in what is owing to &s;o Great a King? Certainly he was not engag'd in re&s;toring King <HI>Henry</HI> and Queen <HI>Margarete</HI> to the Throne? Ah! I don't doubt, but that &s;ome body or other, envi|ous of his Good Fortune, has in&s;inuated &s;ome|thing to your Maje&s;ty to procure his Ruin. Be|lieve your own Eyes, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> giving him
<PB N="120" REF="123">
the Billets he had written to Madam <HI>Grey,</HI> and his Speech with the before mention'd Ver&s;es. The Earl &s;tood &s;urpriz'd to the highe&s;t Degree, with his Eyes fix'd to the Ground, without utter|ing one Word. I am well pleas'd, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> to &s;ee you &s;o much concern'd, there being but few Favourites &s;o generous, as to &s;hare the Misfortunes of tho&s;e whom they think powerful enough to do them a Mi&s;chief; but &s;ince you are &s;o much concern'd for him, Go and advi&s;e him to merit his Pardon, by an Ingenuous Confe&s;&s;ion of his In|trigue with the young Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire;</HI> this being the only Means to appea&s;e my Anger. I am a going to conduct him hither at your Ma|je&s;ty's Feet, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Earl.</HI> No, <HI>cry'd the King,</HI> let him &s;hew never &s;o much Repentance, I will not &s;peak to him, and I could find in my Heart, never to &s;ee him again, but rather to &s;end him into &s;ome dreadful Solitude, where he might at his own lei&s;ure, reflect upon his Fault; but that &s;ome Remnants of Tenderne&s;s plead within me for his better Treatment: In &s;hort, let him be &s;incere, and he may be &s;av'd.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> went immediately to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> but &s;o much overwhelm'd with Grief, as is &s;carce to be expre&s;s'd. To give the Reader the better Idea of the true Occa&s;ion thereof, I &s;hall be oblig'd to give an Account of the Whole Adventure from its fir&s;t Ori|ginal.</P>

My Lord <HI>Stanley</HI> was &s;o much taken with the Picture, that not being able to keep his Eyes from it, he &s;horten'd his Vi&s;it, and return'd home with a full Re&s;olution to have the Picture, co&s;t what it would, tho' he could not well devi&s;e how to encompa&s;s it, they being Rivals, and con|&s;equently not over-complai&s;ant for one another.

When they open'd it, they found the follow|ing Lines upon the fir&s;t Leaf:'<Q>The Object of my Love is offen&s;ive to me, I was not able to engage her; I will be for Change, 'tis a Plea&s;ure to Revenge ones &s;elf by a happy Indiffe|rence.</Q></P>
<P>'Our Unknown is di&s;&s;atisfy'd with his Condition, <HI>&s;aid the Counte&s;s of</HI> Devon&s;hire <HI>laughing;</HI> but he takes his own Way, and I &s;uppo&s;e he is happy in his Liberty by this time. Ah! Madam, <HI>reply'd Mrs.</HI> Howard, that is no &s;ure Rule; I have heard People talk upon that Head, who have found them&s;elves, more than once in their Life time, put to &s;uch Tryals, they were free to own, that the Wounds of the Heart, are far different from others, and prove very hard to be cur'd. I conjure you Brother, <HI>&s;aid the Counte&s;s of</HI> Devon&s;hire, <HI>turning to my Lord</HI> Stanley, tell us in good earne&s;t your Thoughts upon this Point. I am afraid I &s;hall &s;peak again&s;t the Fair Sex, and thus you intend to expo&s;e me to the Indignation of the mo&s;t Aimable Per&s;on in the

I will tell you then, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> you are under a great Mi&s;take, if you imagine that People fix their Love now for any con&s;iderable time; they tell us indeed, That in former Ages, People were ab&s;olutely True and Faithful, That let their Fetters be never &s;o heavy, they wor&s;hip'd them, whether well or ill treated, it was no matter; they lov'd many Years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively without be|ing able to make their Rea&s;on &s;o far to get the upper hand of their Pa&s;&s;ion, as to incline to a Change: But at pre&s;ent we take quite contrary Methods to tho&s;e, and &s;uch as prove much more Commodious; commonly the Per&s;on that Changes fir&s;t, is &s;carce a few Moments before|hand with the other he has lov'd; we now love our Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es as Butterflies do Flowers: If a loving Couple now part without falling quite to Pieces, and expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the Publick, they &s;ay they have done the fine&s;t thing they could do, and that they ought not to be di&s;&s;atisfy'd with one another.'</P>
<P>'If I had the lea&s;t Inclination for an Intrigue, <HI>&s;aid Mrs.</HI> Howard, this Di&s;cription of yours would cure me of it for all my Life time. There is no General without an Exception, <HI>reply'd my Lord,</HI> and I my &s;elf, Madam, dare undertake to be one of the fir&s;t who can give you an In&s;tance, that there are even now, tho&s;e who know how to love at another rate, than what I ju&s;t now &s;poke of.

<P>'The Counte&s;s being not ignorant, that her Brother was in Love with <HI>Lelia,</HI> &s;he told him with a kind of a Malicious Smile; you were in the right, to concern your &s;elf &s;o far, as you did, in what might be contain'd in this <HI>Table-book;</HI> you &s;ee it complains of your Mi&s;tre&s;s, But is it you that is the Occa&s;ion of it? or is your Condition no better than that of this Unfortunate Lover?

He then told them what had happen'd concern|ing the Picture of <HI>P&s;yche.</HI> Truly, Brother, <HI>&s;aid the Counte&s;s,</HI> I begin to fear the Con&s;equence of this Affair; he &s;eems to me mo&s;t furiou&s;ly

And do you think he does not know you, <HI>&s;aid Mrs.</HI> Howard? No, <HI>added the Counte&s;s,</HI> I come &s;o &s;eldom to Court, that if he has &s;een me at all, I dare &s;ay he does not remember me. My Lord <HI>Stanley</HI> de&s;ir'd his Si&s;ter to be &s;atisfy'd, which &s;he promis'd &s;he would, provided he would &s;tay no longer with them. He was no &s;ooner gone, but &s;he told Mrs. <HI>Howard,</HI> I think I did not ami&s;s, in not &s;uffering the Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> to have the Di&s;&s;atisfaction of meeting with a Happy Rival, who is the Subject of his Com|plaints in the&s;e Ver&s;es.

I don't pretend, Madam, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> to de&s;erve the trouble you could give you of the lea&s;t Con|cerns in my Affairs; &s;o I am not in the lea&s;t &s;ur|priz'd at your Indifferency upon that Account. We are not &s;o indifferent as you imagine, <HI>reply'd the Counte&s;s of</HI> Bath, we were actually for break|ing it, rather than not have it open'd, but my Lord <HI>Stanley</HI> oppos'd it.'</P>
<P>'At the&s;e Words the Earl chang'd Colour, and had the&s;e Ladies bin in the lea&s;t acquainted with both their Concerns, they might &s;oon have di&s;cover'd, both in his Eyes and Counte|nance, the Di&s;compo&s;ure of his Mind: But, as they knew nothing of the Adventure of the Picture, they told him, it was the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> who had found and kept it; &s;he is Walking in the next Wood, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> with Mrs. <HI>Howard</HI> and my Lord <HI>Stanley,</HI> where you may ask for it. He parted from them with a mo&s;t profound Reverence, but not without &s;ome Vexation, con&s;idering my Lord <HI>Stanley</HI> was with the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and fearing, le&s;t he might have open'd the <HI>Table-book,</HI> and read his Complaints again&s;t <HI>Lelia,</HI> in order to divert him&s;elf with her at his co&s;t.'</P>
<P>'Di&s;tracted with the&s;e Con&s;iderations, he came to a Shady Walk, which my Lord <HI>Stanley</HI> hap|pening to cro&s;s at the &s;ame time, but &s;o, as to endeavour to avoid being &s;een by they Earl, and this creating in him a Su&s;picion, that he had the <HI>Table-book,</HI> and intended to keep it for his Diver&s;ion, he follow'd him a-pace, crying after him, Stay, &s;tay, my Lord; and &s;o advancing in a threatening Po&s;ture, with his Hand upon his Sword, demanded the <HI>Table-book</HI> of him. My Lord, reply'd fiercely, he had none of his <HI>Table-book,</HI> and &s;o likewi&s;e laying his Hand to his

Sword, they without further ado, Drew upon one another, and, Attack'd one another with &s;uch Re&s;olution, that, in all Probability had prov'd Fatal to them, had not the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Howard,</HI> who were not far off, run to them, and with mo&s;t violent Outcries for Help, thrown them&s;elves mo&s;t courageou&s;ly betwixt their Swords, to part the&s;e Two Rivals.'</P>
<P>'My Lord <HI>Stanley</HI> had no great rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfy'd, as having the Preference before his Rival with Mrs. <HI>Lelia:</HI> And as for the Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> he had no &s;ooner ca&s;t his Eyes upon the Fair Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> but &s;truck with Admiration at her Beauty, this &s;o entirely raz'd out of his Mind, all the Remembrance of <HI>Lelia,</HI> as if his Heart had never &s;igh'd after any thing but the Counte&s;s, who now &s;tood before him, and whom he had &s;een &s;everal times before with|out being &s;truck with her Perfections; whether it were that he did not then take &s;o much notice of her, as now, or whether the Fatal Hour of &s;ur|rendering his Heart, were not then come, we will not determine: But now, taking the Point of his Sword in his Hand, he pre&s;ented it, with a mo&s;t Gallant and Re&s;pectful Air, to the Lady, and with one Knee bent to the Ground, I am vanqui&s;h'd, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he;</HI> I begg at your Hands a Life I could wi&s;h to &s;acrifice in your Service. I did not intend to di&s;arm your Per|&s;on, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> but only to allay your Indignation, intreating him to ri&s;e from the Ground: But, my Lord, &s;ince you have given me Encouragment to de&s;ire a Favour of you, grant my Reque&s;t, and be Friends immediately with my Brother; I am &s;atisfy'd it will not be his Fault, if you are not &s;o, and the Subject of your Quarrel being &s;o incon&s;iderable, I &s;hould be much a&s;ham'd to have

undertaken this Reconciliation, without &s;ucceed|ing in it. You are capable of doing every thing, <HI>reply'd the Earl,</HI> you are ab&s;olute Mi&s;tre&s;s of my De&s;tiny. At the&s;e Words, advancing &s;ome Steps towards my Lord <HI>Stanley,</HI> he did the &s;ame towards him, and &s;o, without enlarging further upon the Matter, they embrac'd, and talk'd together like very good Friends; when the Counte&s;&s;es of <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Bath</HI> &s;omewhat &s;urpriz'd at their long &s;tay, came to look after them. Being &s;oon inform'd concerning the Quarrel betwixt the Earl and my Lord, they oblig'd them once more to embrace one another, and engaged their Honour for their being good Friends for the future; the Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> being very forwards in making the fir&s;t Step, becau&s;e he flatter'd him&s;elf, that by going along with my Lord <HI>Stanley,</HI> he might find an ea&s;ie Acce&s;s into the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire's</HI> Hou&s;e.'</P>
<P>'The Counte&s;s of <HI>Oxford</HI> had a Magnificent Supper ready for her Gue&s;ts in the be&s;t Appart|ment of the Hou&s;e, adorn'd with many fine Statues and Pictures, and among the re&s;t a mo&s;t excellent Piece of <HI>P&s;yche:</HI> The Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> looking very attentively upon it, I am afraid, <HI>&s;aid the Counte&s;s of</HI> Devon&s;hire, lea&s;t this Picture &s;hould revive in you certain Motions of &s;pite again&s;t my Brother. Ah!

Your Thoughts &s;oar very high, my Lord, <HI>reply'd the Counte&s;s:</HI> But

this mu&s;t be attributed to your high De&s;erts. She gave him no further Lei&s;ure to continue his Di&s;cour&s;e, his Eyes &s;ufficiently betray'd his Sen|timents, and whatever Care he took all the re|maining part of the Evening, to come near her, &s;he was &s;o dexterous in &s;hunning all Opportuni|ties, tho' without the lea&s;t &s;hew of Affectation, that he could never meet with her, but in the Company of other Ladies.

He was not much acquainted with this kind of Re&s;ervedne&s;s; his great Qualifications, join'd to the Charms of his Wit, mo&s;t commonly &s;heltred him again&s;t &s;uch like di&s;agreeable Accidents, and his Pa&s;&s;ion being as yet in its beginning, he flat|ter'd him&s;elf with Succe&s;s, if he could apply him&s;elf in good earne&s;t, in the pur&s;uit of his expected Happine&s;s.'</P>
<P>'He manag'd Matters &s;o well with my Lord <HI>Stanley,</HI> that he conducted him to the Counte&s;s his Si&s;ter; but found it a much more ea&s;ie Task to oblige my Lord <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> for whom he had no more than a general Complai&s;ence in point of Policy, than to plea&s;e her whom he Ador'd. Her Deportment towards him, was kept in &s;o exact a Ballance betwixt a hand&s;ome Decorum and an exact Re&s;ervedne&s;s, that he had not the lea&s;t occa&s;ion either to complain or to flatter him&s;elf; at the &s;ame time there was nothing that could have prov'd a greater Affliction to him, con&s;i|dering it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to quit the&s;e flattering Hopes that &s;upported his Pa&s;&s;ion: He wanted Patience to hearken to her Di&s;cour&s;e with Complai&s;ance, becau&s;e he even wanted Re&s;olu|tion to di&s;cover his Pa&s;&s;ion, having mi&s;s'd a thou&s;and Opportunities that fell in his Way, for
<PB N="132" REF="139">
fear of di&s;plea&s;ing this Beautiful Per&s;on: Thus &s;mothering his Secret in the very innermo&s;t Re|ce&s;s of his Heart, the only Comfort he had to allay his Pain, was, that he flatter'd him&s;elf, her Indifferency to be the &s;ame to all the World; That time might afford him &s;ome unlook'd for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that at lea&s;t he &s;hould have the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing of her very often. But not|with&s;tanding his Silence, the Counte&s;s was &s;en&s;i|ble of his tender Sentiments for her, which per|haps might have made &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ions upon her, had not the Merits of the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> &s;o far touch'd her Heart, as to put it beyond all Ca|pacity of taking notice of the Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;ion.'</P> </Q></P>
<P>This was the State of Affairs at Court, when the King told the Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> That he was in Love with the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> as well as the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and order'd him, as I told you before, to go to the &s;aid Earl, and to engage him to make &s;uch an Ingenious Confe&s;&s;ion as might merit his Pardon. It was then the Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> began to call to mind how often he had ob&s;erv'd the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> in a Pen&s;ive Condition; how often he had heard certain Sighs, that &s;eem'd to e&s;cape her unawares; what un&s;ea|&s;onable An&s;wers &s;he us'd to give, and with what Satisfaction &s;he us'd to hear them talk of the Earl of <HI>Warwick.</HI> As he was ignorant that &s;he knew him, &s;o he little &s;u&s;pected of &s;uffering any thing upon his Account on that &s;ide; but at this very Moment he began to be fully convinc'd of his ap|proaching Misfortunes, &s;ince he met with a Ri|val in the Per&s;on of his be&s;t Friend, and &s;uch a one, who&s;e inevitable De&s;truction was at hand, if the King's Indignation were but never &s;o little heighten'd again&s;t him. He &s;tood in need of all

his Genero&s;ity, to e&s;pou&s;e, at this Conjuncture, the Intere&s;t of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> which perhaps he would not have done, had not his Ma&s;ter's Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s threaten'd him with the &s;ame Dangers; &s;o that con&s;idering how blameable it would appear to his own Heart, if he &s;hould be in&s;trumental in adding to his Di&s;grace, which &s;o &s;en&s;ibly afflicted him already, he re&s;olv'd to &s;acri|fice Love to Friend&s;hip, and be &s;erviceable to his Rival, as long as he continu'd to be unfortunate; but to break with him, as &s;oon as he &s;hould cea&s;e to be &s;o.</P>
<P>He under&s;tood that the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> had not bin gone to Bed, till within two Hours before, having &s;pent the re&s;t of the Night, in giving In|&s;tructions to his Gentleman, concerning what he was to &s;ay to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and to <HI>Albine:</HI> He was &s;o very careful not to forget any thing, that he repeated the &s;ame thing a thou&s;and times, and now after his Departure, thinking to take &s;ome re&s;t, was &s;oon di&s;turb'd by the Earl of <HI>Pembrook.</HI> After having given him an Account of the whole matter, Don't think, <HI>added he,</HI> of ju&s;tifying your &s;elf, by di&s;owning the thing, for the King has order'd me to produce before your Face the Witne&s;&s;es of your Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s, and of your Breach of Faith to him; he is re|&s;olv'd to be well inform'd of the whole, even to the meane&s;t Circum&s;tance, and then he will con&s;i|der, whether to do you Ju&s;tice, or afford you his Pardon. The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> enrag'd at the &s;ight of the Letters he writ to Madam <HI>Grey,</HI> That Perfidious Woman, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> has made me a Sacrifice: She was in the right on't, to imagine, that it was not on account of her own Per&s;on, I &s;hould &s;carce have taken &s;o much Pains for her; but time will come, when I &s;hall make her &s;en&s;ible of my Indignation.

of Revenge, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> you mu&s;t find a way to appea&s;e the King. And how is that to be done, <HI>reply'd the Earl of</HI> Warwick?

Belov'd, <HI>reply'd the Earl of</HI> Warwick, I know nothing of that; but if I am not, I don't de&s;pair of being &s;o.

be&s;t of my Friends. I begg of him, to take Pity of the Frailties of my Heart, which not always con&s;ults Rea&s;on, before it &s;urrenders it &s;elf: I fell in Love with the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> before I knew any thing of his Maje&s;ty's Pa&s;&s;ion for her: When he did me the Honour to make me his Con|fident therein, it was too late for me to hope for a Cure; I rather cheri&s;h'd my Fetters, and con|ceal'd them with all po&s;&s;ible Care, not &s;o much out of fear to di&s;oblige the King, as out of a de|&s;ire of plea&s;ing the Per&s;on I Ador'd: At la&s;t her Departure threw me into &s;o deep a Melancholly, Vexation and Extravagancy, that I di&s;cover'd my &s;elf, in Writing certain Ver&s;es in&s;tead of the Speech the King dictated to me. Madam <HI>Grey</HI> has taken this Opportunity to contrive my Ruin, by &s;hewing my Letters; but after all, What is it they can do to me? As long as I am prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion as I now am, nothing, but what has a relation to that, will have any Effect upon me: All the re&s;t, whether good or bad, whether Rewards or Cha&s;ti&s;ements, all this, I &s;ay, will not affect me: And this is perhaps the only Thing in this Intrigue, the King is not acquainted with as yet; and this being all I can tell him, pray let him know it from me. The Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> who was his real Friend, de&s;ir'd him to alter his Re&s;olutions, and by an account, without re&s;erve, to appea&s;e his Maje&s;ty. He told him, He could &s;ay no more, That he was not Happy, but that, if his Fortune &s;hould prove more favourable, all the mo&s;t Cruel Torments &s;hould not force from his Mouth, as much as one Word, that might prove injurious to the Honour of a Lady that was &s;o dear to him; and that it could not but vex him to the Heart, to find the King to have &s;o ill an Opinion of him, as to think him capable of betraying the Favours of a Lady. The Earl of
<PB N="136" REF="143">
<HI>Pembrook</HI> repre&s;ented to him the ill Con&s;equences of his Ob&s;tanacy. But he told him, He would expect the Stroak with Tranquillity, having this &s;ecret Satisfaction, That he knew nothing where|with to reproach him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ambiguous An&s;wers made the Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI>'s Thoughts fluctuate betwixt Hope and Fear; &s;ometimes he thought the Earl no more Happy than him&s;elf, and at other times he did not doubt, but that he liv'd in certain Hopes of being belov'd; but as all this remain'd in an in|certitude, &s;o the more he abandon'd him&s;elf to the&s;e Reflections, the more matter of Trouble he encounter'd with, in unfolding the Mi&s;tery. Alas! <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I have not had Courage enough to &s;peak, nay, not &s;o much as to &s;uffer my Eyes, to make known my pre&s;ent Condition; and the Earl has writ to this Counte&s;s, nay, has had an Interview with her in the mid&s;t of a dark Night: For, tho' he did not ab&s;olutely confe&s;s it, who can doubt it, after what has happen'd when he was taken up by the Watch? See how I pay for my Timidity, my re&s;pectful Silence is puni&s;h'd, as if it were a Crime. Thus Comfortle&s;s he goes back to the Court, with &s;o dejected a Countenance, as if he had bin very Sick: The King was &s;ur|priz'd at the &s;ight thereof, and could not for bear to &s;hew him &s;ome peculiar Marks of good Will, for being &s;o perfect a Friend. When he gave an account to his Maje&s;ty of what had pa&s;s'd be|twixt the Earl and him, he left nothing unat|tempted to allay the King's Indignation, and wrought &s;o effectually upon the King, that he re&s;olv'd not to Bani&s;h &s;o far off, as he at fir&s;t in|tended: Nay, he begg'd the King to &s;end him only to <HI>Chel&s;ey;</HI> but the King being too well ac|quainted with that Seat, as not to know what Plea&s;ures he might enjoy there, he pitch'd upon
<PB N="137" REF="144">
<HI>Caerleon</HI> for a Place of his Bani&s;hment. This had bin in former Ages a con&s;iderable City in <HI>South-Wales,</HI> &s;eated upon the River <HI>&V;&s;que,</HI> but whereof nothing being left now but Ruins and Mi&s;erable Remnants of Antiquity, this prov'd not a very convenient Place for the Entertainment of a Per|&s;on, &s;o much accu&s;tom'd as he was to Plea&s;ure and Magnificence.</P>
<P>The King now exa&s;perated to a high degree, order'd the Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> to return immediate|ly to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and to tell him from him, That within two Hours he mu&s;t depart for <HI>Caerleon.</HI> He was &s;omewhat doubtful, whether he had be&s;t accept of this Commi&s;&s;ion, or whether he &s;hould de&s;ire the King to employ &s;ome body el&s;e in it; but at la&s;t, fearing, le&s;t his Friend might not receive this Command with &s;o much Submi&s;&s;ion as he ought to do, and that the &s;ame might be afterwards ill repre&s;ented to the King, in hopes of con&s;ummating the Ruin of a Di&s;|grac'd Favourite, mo&s;t frequently practis'd among Courtiers, he was contented to undertake this Order, the better to take care of his Friends In|tere&s;t: He thought it but requi&s;ite, to bring in by way of Introduction, certain things commonly made U&s;e of, to prepare People's Minds again&s;t an ill Piece of News. To what purpo&s;e &s;erve all the&s;e Precautions, my Lord, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> when I told you this Morning, that nothing could actually af|flict me, unle&s;s it related to my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire;</HI> if nothing that is ami&s;s, has befaln her, &s;peak without fear, for I am prepar'd again&s;t all Events. You are to be &s;ent out of the way, <HI>&s;aid the Earl of</HI> Pembrook, <HI>embracing him.</HI> I am overjoy'd at it, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> And has the King done me the Favour to pitch upon a Place remote from all Conver&s;a|tion with the World? A De&s;art, where I may employ my Thoughts Day and Night? where I

may &s;end forth my Sighs and Complaints, for not &s;eeing the Counte&s;s? and where, at la&s;t, I may not come near that dangerous She-Favourite of his, the Pre&s;ence whereof will be always odious to me. Your Wi&s;hes are accompli&s;h'd, <HI>&s;aid the Earl of</HI> Pembrook, <HI>Caerleon</HI> is the Place de&s;ign'd by the King for your Bani&s;hment, and it is his Plea&s;ure you &s;hould depart within two Hours. The time is very &s;hort, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> but no Matter, I &s;hall be pleas'd once more with the Sight of the River <HI>&V;&s;que:</HI> Pray tell the King, That within two Hours, I will be no more in <HI>London,</HI> and that I &s;hall be very well pleas'd with my Place of Abode. They did bid one another Farewel with all the Tenderne&s;s imaginable; for the Earl not knowing my Lord of <HI>Pembrook</HI> to be his Rival, there was nothing that interfer'd with their Friend&s;hip on his &s;ide. He left <HI>London</HI> with &s;o much Precipitation, that he would not &s;o much as take his Leave of the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> and the Marque&s;s of <HI>Montague,</HI> his Brothers: For, he fear'd, that they being incens'd at his ill Treat|ment, might urge him to go over to <HI>Calas,</HI> whereof he was then Governour; and by putting him&s;elf under the Protection of the <HI>French</HI> King, revenge him&s;elf of King <HI>Edward.</HI></P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s Gentleman coming to <HI>Twittenham</HI> with Letters from the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Norfolk</HI> to my Lady <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> thought not fit to deliver them him&s;elf for fear of being known, but gave them to the <HI>French</HI> Gardener, his pre|tended Ma&s;ter, to give them to that Lady, whil&s;t he kept at a di&s;tance in one of the darke&s;t Corners of the Room. The Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> much pleas'd with the Draughts this Gardener &s;hew'd her, pitch'd upon one for her Garden, ordering him to begin it the next Day. The Fellow was very well pleas'd with it, being born and train'd

up in this kind of Work, but agreed but very in|differently with <HI>Berincour,</HI> he being but little us'd to Hard&s;hip; e&s;pecially &s;ince the Counte&s;s being very eager to have it brought to Perfection, and there being abundance of Weeds to be cut up, and other matters to be done, he that was to Survey the Work, us'd often to check him after a very rough manner. His be&s;t Comfort was, That he &s;aw the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> taking a Walk every Day in a Shady Wilderne&s;s, at the End of the Place where they were at Work; but in &s;o Melancholly a Condition, and accompany'd by &s;o many Surveyers, that he dur&s;t not &s;peak to her for fear of being di&s;cover'd. As for <HI>Albine,</HI> &s;he did not appear for a con&s;iderable time, being detain'd in Bed by an <HI>Ague;</HI> &s;o that the poor Earl, who impatiently long'd for &s;ome News in his Solitude, could not hear of any a good while that might be plea&s;ing to him <HI>Berincour</HI> knew that <HI>Albine</HI> was Sick, at la&s;t took an Opportunity to let her know by a young Woman, with whom he dined &s;ome times, That if &s;he pleas'd, he could Cure her, provided &s;he would let him apply cer|tain Herbs to her Wre&s;ts, which would produce an almo&s;t &s;tupendious Effect. So &s;he &s;ent for him, and he, after &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious Ceremonies, ap|ply'd the Herbs to her Wre&s;ts; but at the &s;ame time, did not forget to revive her Eye-&s;ight with the Lu&s;tre of the Jewel his Ma&s;ter had &s;ent her by him, which he held in his Hand, &s;o as to be &s;een by no body but her &s;elf The old <HI>Albine</HI> dazled with the Brightne&s;s thereof, &s;oon got out of Bed into the Garden, where &s;he call'd for the Garden|er's Man, under pretence that he &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t her in &s;upporting her to Walk, whil&s;t they might talk of the mo&s;t &s;tupendious Operations and Cure perform'd by his Herbs.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="147">
So &s;oon as he had an Opportunity of &s;peaking to her, he told her, That the Earl had no other Hopes left, but what he expected from her A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, having &s;ent him on purpo&s;e to acquaint her with every thing that pa&s;s'd: That he was afflicted to the Heart, becau&s;e he heard no News from my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> &s;ince &s;he had left <HI>London,</HI> and therefore had given him a large Letter di|rected to my Lady, and a Jewel for her. Things have faln out &s;o unexpectedly, <HI>an&s;wer'd Albine,</HI> and the young Counte&s;s has &s;o po&s;&s;itively forbid me to entertain any further Corre&s;pondence with the Earl, that this join'd to the Impo&s;&s;ibility of Writing, without being di&s;cover'd by &s;o many <HI>Argus</HI>'s as we have about us, I &s;aw my &s;elf con|&s;train'd to be quiet, when I wi&s;h'd I could have done otherwi&s;e. She then told him what had happen'd with the Watch; the unfortunate Ac|cident of the Jewel and Picture; the Jealou&s;y of the Earl, and the Vexation of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and how &s;he had bin reprimanded by her Mother. What mu&s;t we do, my dear <HI>Albine, &s;aid Berincour?</HI> My Ma&s;ter can't live if your Mi&s;tre&s;s per&s;everes in her Rigour; I conjure you by all that is good, to procure me a Moment to &s;peak with her, or at lea&s;t, take my Letter, and let me have an An&s;wer. I can promi&s;e you no|thing, <HI>&s;aid Albine,</HI> you may be a&s;&s;ur'd of my Zeal for your Service. For fear their Conver&s;ation &s;hould have created &s;ome Su&s;picion if it had continu'd longer, <HI>Albine</HI> went out of the Garden, but fail'd not to come again every Day, and would talk with <HI>Berincour</HI> under &s;ome favourable pretence or other.</P>
<P>I told you before, he was a Hand&s;ome Fellow, &s;o that, notwith&s;tanding the Sun had made him as Tawny as a <HI>Tawny-Moor,</HI> and his being much har|ra&s;s'd with continual Labour, the old Gentle|woman
<PB N="141" REF="148">
took a great Fan&s;ie to him: She &s;uppos'd nothing could be more proper, than to make a Match betwixt the He and She Confidents of two Rich Lovers: That the Earl being in a Condition to make his Gentleman's Fortune, my Lady would &s;hew no le&s;s Liberality and Goodne&s;s for her: To be &s;hort, &s;he had got the Match &s;o far in her Head, that &s;he took but little concern in the Affair of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and whenever &s;he found her &s;elf urg'd by <HI>Berincour,</HI> &s;he would tell him, &s;he was forc'd to act with a great deal of Precaution. What makes you, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> detain me thus here? You know what Danger I am in if I am di&s;cover'd; I am oblig'd to Work from Day-break till Night; I am ready to die for Vexation, and am convinc'd you don't intend to do any further Service to my Ma&s;ter. How impa|tient are you, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> and how little concern you &s;hew, and the Trouble I take of coming &s;o frequently to talk with you: Alas! were your Heart as inclinable to gratitude, as mine is, you would not be &s;o eager for going, but would make the be&s;t U&s;e of the pre&s;ent Opportunity. At the&s;e Words, <HI>Berincour</HI> was ready to bur&s;t out a laughing: but having forborn it with much ado, he told her, That all this time his Thoughts were taken up with his Ma&s;ter's Affairs, but that for the future &s;he might be &s;ure of all his Applications, and that &s;he &s;hould be &s;atisfy'd how pa&s;&s;ionately he lov'd her. <HI>Albine</HI> being un|certain whether &s;he had be&s;t believe him or not, And how can I be a&s;&s;ur'd, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> that you will Love me, if you don't Love me already? I &s;hould much &s;u&s;pect a Pa&s;&s;ion, that is &s;o much at your Command. He told her, That his &s;eeing and loving her were of the &s;ame Date; That if &s;he would di&s;patch him quickly, he would &s;oon re|turn on purpo&s;e to Court her. This Promi&s;e

&s;et the old Gentlewoman to Work; for the &s;ame Evening, &s;he told my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> That nei|ther her Silence nor her Coldne&s;s being able to check the Earls P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ion, he had left no Stone un|turn'd to hear &s;ome News of her, and that his Gentleman was there in Di&s;gui&s;e to deliver her a Letter, which &s;he had undertaken to give to her.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s's Colour changed at the&s;e Words; Will you Ruin me <HI>Albine, &s;aid &s;he?</HI> have you al|ready forgot how much I have &s;uffered only for having acted with le&s;s Re&s;ervedne&s;s than I &s;hould have done? And though I have nothing that is Material to upbraid my &s;elf withal, 'tis ne|verthele&s;s too much to give the World real Cau&s;e of Su&s;picion. Don't &s;peak to me any more of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> my Stubborn Heart is too apt to do it without you. How! Madam, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Albine <HI>to her,</HI> will you refu&s;e to accept his Letter? Yes, I will refu&s;e it, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> Give it back to him who brought it to you, and order him from me to be gone. <HI>Albine,</HI> not a little &s;urprized at this re&s;olute An&s;wer, You will then prove the Cau&s;e of his Death, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> or perhaps he will commit &s;uch a Piece of Ex|travagancy, as you will have occa&s;ion to repent of as long as you live. And how long is it, <HI>reply'd the Counte&s;s, with an angry look,</HI> &s;ince Men have that Liberty of Per&s;ecuting a Woman, that is inclined to adhere &s;trictly to her Duty? Leave me at re&s;t <HI>Albine,</HI> the Force I put upon my Inclinations, is ready to put an end to my Life; but what matter is it, <HI>added &s;he, with a very Me|lancholy Air,</HI> &s;ince I have nothing that &s;hould render Life more de&s;ireable to me. At the&s;e Words, the Tears beginning to &s;tand in her Eyes, <HI>Albine</HI> look'd upon it as a favourable Mi|nute to engage her to open the Earl's Pacquet,
<PB N="143" REF="150">
Madam, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> throwing her &s;elf at her Feet, don't you refu&s;e to Read this Letter, my Lord <HI>Warwick</HI> will otherwi&s;e think you &s;light him; and how do you think a Man of his Haughty Temper can dige&s;t &s;uch a u&s;age as this? Per|haps his Love may turn into Hatred. Oh! let him Hate me, <HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> 'tis all I de&s;ire him to do. But all this while, her Heart not be|ing &s;trong enough to retain her Sighs with|in her Brea&s;t, and <HI>Albine</HI> watching narrowly every one of her Motions, did not fail to tell her a Thou&s;and Rea&s;ons, to engage her to o|pen the Pacquet; But &s;eeing the Counte&s;s would not do it, &s;he did Read it aloud before her: The Counte&s;s had weakne&s;s enough to hear it Read, but cou'd not be prevail'd upon to re|turn an An&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>Albine</HI> having given a full account of all that had pa&s;s'd, to <HI>Berincour,</HI> he found &s;uch an a|greeable Mixture of Tenderne&s;s and Vertue in this Proceeding of my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> that he could not forbear to Compa&s;&s;ionate her Con|dition, and to wi&s;h, that his Ma&s;ter would de|&s;i&s;t from pur&s;uing the Matter any further. Not|with&s;tanding which, he fail'd not to entreat the old Gentlewoman to renew her Temptations, to obtain a few Lines from her Hands, and &s;he was not &s;paring either of her Arguments nor Prayers; but the Counte&s;s tired with her impor|tunity, threatning to acquaint her Lord with it; She found now, there was nothing to be done for <HI>Berincour,</HI> but to return to his Ma&s;ter, and to give &s;ome Colour to his Departure, The Head Gardener pretended, he had occa&s;ion to &s;end him to <HI>London,</HI> to Buy &s;ome things he &s;tood in need of.</P>

The Account he receiv'd from him, &s;erving only to make him think him|&s;elf more unhappy than really he was, threw him into a very deep Melancholly, and he now began to fan&s;y, that <HI>Albine,</HI> out of a Motive of &s;elf Intere&s;t, had flattered him with all tho&s;e Tender Relations, She &s;aid &s;he had under&s;tood in Conver&s;ing with his Mi&s;tre&s;s; and that it was too true, that &s;he had no more than a bare Indifferency for him, becau&s;e &s;he would not Write to him. This Opinion being back'd by many Circum&s;tances, threw him into a mo&s;t violent Angui&s;h: Thus he &s;pent Three days, un|der the greate&s;t Incertitude what to do; till at la&s;t, he re&s;olv'd to &s;end back <HI>Berincour</HI> to the Counte&s;s, and to fill his Letters with &s;uch urg|ing Complaints and Declarations of Re&s;pect, that &s;he &s;hould not remain in&s;en&s;ible thereat. His Gentleman, who not very well liked his Errand, repre&s;ented to him, but in vain, how little like|lihood there was for better Succe&s;s in this Se|cond, than in his Fir&s;t Journey; But he upbraid|ing him with Want of Affection, he departed in the old Di&s;gui&s;e of a Gardener, the better to conceal him&s;elf from every body.</P>
<P>During his Ab&s;ence, my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> who was with Child, narrowly e&s;caped being kill'd by a Fall; So that upon his Arrival
<PB N="145" REF="152">
there, he was told by <HI>Albine,</HI> that it would be very difficult for her Mi&s;tre&s;s to find a favourable Opportunity of &s;peaking to him; becau&s;e &s;he was very &s;eldom left alone. But, <HI>added &s;he,</HI> What happens very Fortunate, is, that I &s;hall of|ten &s;ee you; &s;o we mu&s;t talk concerning our Marriage; and if we can't accompli&s;h the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and the Counte&s;&s;es Bu&s;ine&s;s, at lea&s;t we will take care of our own.

The&s;e Words having added new Life and Vigour to the Old Gentlewoman's De&s;ires, &s;he immediate|ly acquainted her Mi&s;tre&s;s with the News of the return of the Earl's Gentleman, which proved a fre&s;h occa&s;ion of Trouble to her. She Com|manded her po&s;itively not to take his Letters; and that, if he did not withdraw from the Hou&s;e forthwith, &s;he would make him repent of it.

An&s;wer, he told her, That &s;ince his &s;o &s;udden Departure would be infallibly attended with &s;ome remarkable ill Con&s;equences, he only de|&s;ired &s;ome time to do it at his own lea&s;ure, and when he &s;aw a fit opportunity to do it; and <HI>Albine</HI> managed the Matter &s;o far with my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> that &s;he gave Ear to this Propo&s;i|tion.

During <HI>Berincour</HI>'s late Journey to <HI>Caerleon,</HI> the before-mention'd <HI>French</HI> Gardener was faln in Love with a Hand&s;ome young <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dam&s;el, and as it is a hard Task to keep any thing from what one loves, this Gardener was not altogether &s;o much taken up with his Court&s;hip, but that he would &s;ometimes Talk of his Companion; and this young Woman taking particular notice of this Gentleman in Di&s;gui&s;e, began to like him &s;o well, that &s;he thought, if &s;he were born a Gentle|woman, &s;he could be much better &s;atisfy'd with him, than with a Country Fellow: At la&s;t &s;he could not forbear to &s;peak concerning him to her Mother, and it would have bin Death to the old Woman, not to tell the Secret to her Husband: So the Gardener perceiving the thing to have taken Vent thought it his &s;afe&s;t way, to declare the whole Truth thereof him&s;elf to the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI> He was touch'd to the quick at this News, not knowing what to re&s;olve upon; &s;ome|times he was for cutting <HI>Berincour</HI>'s Throat be|fore his Lady's Face, and then to carry things to the utmo&s;t Extremity.

came to this River with no other Intention, than to throw my &s;elf to the Bottom of it, to put an end to tho&s;e Misfortunes I was not Born to. <HI>Hereford</HI> looking upon him like a Man amaz'd, What has happen'd to you, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid he?</HI> You know I am ab&s;olutely yours, let me be a Sharer in your Di&s;contents, perhaps I may help you to &s;upport them with the more Patience. Oh! <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> my Pain owes its Original to a Cau&s;e which exceeds all ordinary Pains: That Exce&s;s of Friend&s;hip I always had for my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> is now the deadly Cau&s;e of my Grief. How! <HI>cry'd the Chevalier,</HI> You don't complain of her? I can't imagine what Rea&s;on you &s;hould have for it. Hear me, <HI>&s;aid the Earl, interrupting him,</HI> and I will leave it to your own Judgment. He then gave him an ample account of the whole Matter, intermixing his Relation with Tender Reproaches, and Violent Threats, no otherwi&s;e than if he had bin talking to his Lady, whence it was ea&s;ie to gue&s;s, that it would prove very difficult to moderate his Anger: However, the Chevalier having a fix'd and &s;ingular E&s;teem for the Counte&s;s, was re&s;olv'd to undertake the Task.</P>
<P>You are not in a Condition to act in your own Per&s;on, <HI>&s;aid he to the Earl,</HI> becau&s;e the Point in Que&s;tion too nearly concerns you: Your Sen&s;es are impair'd, and you will &s;ee your Lady's Inno|cence, even when you would not &s;ee it. Well, &s;uppo&s;ing the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s Gentleman to be in your Hou&s;e Di&s;guis'd like a Gardener, doubt|le&s;s his Ma&s;ter &s;ent him either to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in coming hither Incognito, or to receive his Let|ters, and to deliver his An&s;wers; it will be no hard matter for you to find out the true rea&s;on thereof, give him but a little <HI>Opium,</HI> and having got his Papers into your Hands, you may take the be&s;t Mea&s;ures you can, without the lea&s;t Noi&s;e.
<PB N="153" REF="160">
If the Earl of <HI>Warwick, reply'd the Earl,</HI> keeps him here to favour his coming privately into the Hou&s;e, there is no way to find it out, unle&s;s by the Confe&s;&s;ion of this Gentleman. No Matter, <HI>reply'd the Chevalier,</HI> let us begin with my Propo|&s;al, and we will end, as you &s;hall think fit. The Chevalier prevailing with the Earl to follow his Advice, it was agreed to mix &s;ome <HI>Opium</HI> in the Gentleman's Drink, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of one of their Faithful Dome&s;ticks, who met with no great Difficulty to perform his Promi&s;e. <HI>Berincour,</HI> who had work'd very hard all that Day in the Garden, being much tired at Night, and eager for his Supper, to go to Bed in good time, becau&s;e he was to ri&s;e next Morning before Day-break, in order to depart with the &s;o much de&s;ir'd An&s;wer of the Counte&s;s's, he was to deliver to the Earl.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chevalier de Hereford,</HI> de&s;ir'd the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> to leave the whole Management of this Affair to his Conduct; &s;o that entring the pre|tended Gardener's Chamber, in Company of that Per&s;on only who had procur'd the <HI>Opium,</HI> he found a very large Pacquet about him; what had increas'd its Bulk, was, That the Counte&s;s being re&s;olv'd not to keep the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s Letters, and having not Re&s;olution enough to burn them, &s;he &s;ent them back along with her own Letter. The Chevalier much &s;urpriz'd at the Sight of the Pacquet, was at a &s;tand, whether to give it to the Earl or not, being ignorant of the Contents thereof, which he fear'd might turn to my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>'s Ruin: It was then he made a thou&s;and Melancholly Reflections upon the Misfortunes unto which too often the Imprudence of young People expo&s;es them; and had he thought him&s;elf &s;ure of his Opinion, he would certainly have a|voided to give new cau&s;e of Trouble to his Kin&s;|man:
<PB N="154" REF="161">
But the wor&s;t was, that be&s;ides that, the Dome&s;tick, who went along with him, had &s;een the Pacquet, the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> would not be &s;atisfy'd at an ea&s;ie rate. And it prov'd &s;o on the &s;equel, for he waited for him in a long Gallery, where di&s;turb'd with his Inquietudes he walk'd up and down a-pace, and no &s;ooner &s;aw the Cheva|lier, but laying his Hand to his Sword, not know|ing very well what he did, or what he would have, ask'd him abruptly for the Letters. I am a com|ing to give them to you, <HI>&s;aid the Chevalier;</HI> and then delivering them to the Earl, he tore the Covert and Signets, and &s;oon knew the fir&s;t the Earl's, and then his Lady's Hand writing; at the la&s;t of which he &s;tood very much &s;urpriz'd, whil&s;t the Chevalier was highly pleas'd thereat.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> the Counte&s;s is not guilty; the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> Per&s;ecutes her, he &s;ends his Gentleman without her knowledge; &s;he forbids him to Love her; &s;he is angry with him; &s;he will not &s;o much as keep his Letters, which would appear plea&s;ing to any other Woman but her &s;elf; What further Satisfaction can you de&s;ire? You repre&s;ent to me, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> my Wife's Conduct on the faire&s;t Side; but let us take the thing as really it is, What can you &s;ay for a young Lady, who &s;uffers a Gentle|man of &s;o dangerous a Per&s;on as the Earl of <HI>War|wick</HI> is, to &s;tay in her Family? Who lets him a|bide there in Di&s;gui&s;e? Who keeps his Secret? Who receives his Letters? And who in effect tells him that &s;he Loves him, in telling him, <HI>That &s;he can't hate him?</HI> In what Country be&s;ides this, would &s;uch kind of Freedom be allow'd of with Patience? The Chevalier let him go on in his Di&s;|cour&s;e, without the lea&s;t Contradiction, for fear of exa&s;perating him the more, in ca&s;e he &s;hould endeavour to convince him by &s;trength of Rea&s;on,

which &s;eldom takes place with Per&s;ons infected with Jealou&s;y; but only conjur'd him, not to di&s;turb the Repo&s;e of his whole Family, by noi&s;ing the Thing abroad. At la&s;t he put him in mind, that the Counte&s;s had acquir'd the general good Opi|nion of all the World, as a Per&s;on who in all re|&s;pects an&s;wer'd the Character of that Education &s;he had by the Care of my Lady her Mother; but that if he &s;uffer'd this matter, in the lea&s;t, to take Vent, the Publick Rumour, which always makes a Mon&s;ter of a Fly, would al&s;o, upon this occa&s;ion, not be &s;pairing to aggrandize the Story: That if he would follow his Advice, he ought to manage the Point with the utmo&s;t Addre&s;s and Nicety, and to contrive how to make a Breach betwixt her and the Earl; For, &s;ince it was evi|dent by her Letter, that &s;he preferr'd her Duty before all other Con&s;iderations, it would be no diffiult Task, to &s;ecure her in that Opinion. Ac|cordingly it was agreed betwixt the Earl of <HI>De|von&s;hire</HI> and the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> to keep the whole Secret from the knowledge of the Counte&s;s, and to write the&s;e few Words in a Woman's Character to the Earl of <HI>Warwick.</HI><Q>Let me be at re&s;t, I will never hear you as much as to be &s;poken of.</Q></P>
<P>They folded the Paper, and having made up the Pacquet ju&s;t as it was before, &s;eal'd it with ju&s;t &s;uch another Seal as that of the Counte&s;s's; the Earl, who had given it to her, happening to have the fellow of it. Every thing being thus contriv'd, they put it again into <HI>Berincour</HI>'s Pocket, unperceiv'd to him: And &s;o, according as he had propos'd the Night before, he went away, to &s;atisfy his Ma&s;ter, who expected his Return with the utmo&s;t Impatience.</P>

<P>At la&s;t, this Di&s;temper, the mo&s;t dangerous of all &s;orts of Fevers, began to abate by Degrees; his Rea&s;on, which had lain conceal'd for a great while, began on a &s;udden to take its proper Sta|tion, and di&s;play its Charms: 'Twas now he be|gan to compa&s;&s;ionate his De&s;tiny, and be &s;en&s;ible of its Hard&s;hip. The &s;ame De&s;art, which &s;o lately had appear'd to him the mo&s;t delightful Place in the World, was now turn'd to the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable of all others: Hitherto the Days &s;eem'd too &s;hort for him to ruminate upon his Pa&s;&s;ion, but now they were in&s;upportable to him; and if now and then he thought of the Counte&s;s, it was in &s;pite of him&s;elf, and to find out her De|fects.

<P>The Chevalier having engag'd the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> upon his Honour, not to &s;hew the lea&s;t Indifferency or Anger to his Lady, and every thing being agreed betwixt them, in re|lation to the further Management of this Af|fair, he went to <HI>London,</HI> but came back into the Country &s;oon after.

<P>Within two Days after, the <HI>Chevalier de Here|ford,</HI> as he was Walking with the Counte&s;s in the Garden, look'd upon this as a favourable Opportunity to manage his De&s;ign: He told her, He was &s;orry he &s;hould prove the Occa&s;ion of giving her &s;ome Di&s;quiet; but that he could not, without blaming him&s;elf, forbear to ac|quaint her with the Actions of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who had &s;o little regard to her Fa|vours, as to &s;hew her Letters abroad: That one of them being by good Fortune faln into his Hands, he had kept it, and was now come on purpo&s;e to re&s;tore it to her.

My Intentions were too &s;incere and unblemi&s;h'd, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to the Chevalier,</HI> in writing this Billet, to have the lea&s;t occa&s;ion of di&s;owning it; and I dare promi&s;e my &s;elf, that, every thing being duly con&s;ider'd, it will turn rather to my Honour than Di&s;grace; at the &s;ame time it makes me &s;en&s;ible of the Ba&s;e|ne&s;s of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> again&s;t whom I from this time vow an implacable Hatred: He mu&s;t certainly be one of the ba&s;e&s;t Men li|ving, to play me &s;uch a Game; but I will a&s;&s;ure him, it &s;hall never be &s;aid, he contriv'd my Ruin for his own Diver&s;ion, &s;ince I will make him feel the Effects of my Re&s;entment. Ma|dam, <HI>reply'd the Chevalier,</HI> if you will give me leave to advi&s;e you, &s;tifle this Matter, for fear it &s;hould come to my Lord <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>'s Ears; you know him to be a Man too nice in certain Points; and the la&s;t time we came hither, he told me &s;ome part of his Affliction upon the Road: Believe me, Madam, the &s;ecure&s;t way a Lady of your Age and Birth can take, is, not to give any occa&s;ion of her being much talk'd of in Publick, &s;ince there are not wanting every where, &s;uch as will put the wor&s;t Interpreta|tion upon the mo&s;t Innocent Actions that can be: You live in a numerous Family, and the be&s;t way to obtain their Commendation, is, not to make your &s;elf a publick Di&s;cour&s;e at Court, and that it may not be &s;aid, the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> has bin quarreling &s;uch a Day, and &s;uch a Day, with the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> be|cau&s;e he &s;hew'd a Letter &s;he had written to him.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was talking to her, &s;he kept her Eyes immoveably fix'd on the Ground, and then bur&s;ting out into Tears, &s;he thank'd him for
<PB N="160" REF="167">
his Advice, a&s;&s;uring him that &s;he would follow it, being re&s;olv'd not to appear any more at Court, but to pa&s;s all the remainder of her Days in the Country. The Chevalier told her, it would not be for her good, thus to re&s;olve upon &s;uch an Extream, &s;ince &s;he could not re|fu&s;e to go along with the Family, if they went to <HI>London.</HI> She an&s;wer'd, She was re&s;olv'd not to go thither, unle&s;s the Earl her Spou&s;e &s;hould oblige her to it, which &s;he &s;uppos'd he would not; for <HI>Twittenham</HI> being not above Eight or Nine Miles from <HI>London,</HI> he might go and come at plea&s;ure, without the lea&s;t Inconveniency. The Chevalier, finding her &s;o re&s;olute, thought it more convenient to &s;eem to approve of her De&s;ign, than to conte&s;t any longer in vain, e&s;pecially &s;ince he knew the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> intended to keep her in the Country for a con&s;i|derable time.</P>
<P>She was no &s;ooner gone, but the Chevalier returning to the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>'s Apart|ment, gave him an Account of their whole Con|ver&s;ation, and they were both extreamly well &s;atisfy'd, both with this fir&s;t good Succe&s;s, and with the Re&s;olution they had taken of breaking off the Corre&s;pondence with the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> by furni&s;hing them with occa&s;ion of mutual Complaints; whereas if they had made a Noi&s;e of the matter, it might have &s;erv'd rather to cement their Affections, and <HI>Chevalier de Hereford</HI> being apprehen&s;ive, that his Kin&s;man might make &s;ome fal&s;e Steps, con|trary to what had bin agreed on betwixt them, &s;eldom left him alone, taking all Opportunities of allaying his Anger.</P>
<P>My Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> returning into her Clo&s;et, and throwing her &s;elf upon a Couch, without &s;aying one Word to <HI>Albine,</HI> and &s;he perceiving
<PB N="161" REF="168">
&s;ome remarkable alterations in her looks, begg'd her to impart to her the rea&s;on of her Grief. Oh! Unhappy Woman, <HI>&s;aid the Counte&s;s with a &s;urious look,</HI> 'Tis thou that art the Cau&s;e of my Grief; Thou ha&s;t plagued me to receive the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s Letters, and it was thou who did&s;t engage me, in &s;pite of all my Fore|&s;ight, to return an an&s;wer to them.

At la&s;t, Madam, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> and has the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> Treated you thus unworthily? 'Twas then up|on that account only, he &s;ent his Gentleman hi|ther to get one of your Letters into his Hands, to boa&s;t of your Favours; I prote&s;t to you, I will not as much as mention him any more, un|le&s;s it be to conjure you, to continue and en|crea&s;e your Hatred to him. There is no need for thy intermedling any further in the Matter, <HI>&s;aid the Counte&s;s,</HI> thy Bu&s;ine&s;s is not &s;o much as to remember his Name in my Pre&s;ence; Leave the re&s;t to my Care, and I will acquit my &s;elf in &s;uch a manner, that no blame &s;hall be laid at my Door.</P>
<P>If it were po&s;&s;ible, <HI>reply'd</HI> Albine, <HI>after having pau&s;ed a while,</HI> to doubt of what one &s;ees with

ones own Eyes, I mu&s;t confe&s;s to you Madam, I &s;hould &s;carce &s;o ab&s;olutely Condemn the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> without being heard. None but &s;uch mean and &s;elf-intere&s;&s;ed Souls as thine, <HI>&s;aid the Counte&s;s,</HI> can be Guilty of thus impo&s;ing upon them&s;elves: As to my &s;elf, who give Thanks to God, have nothing in me that Re&s;embles thee, have fix'd my Re&s;olutions to Hate him for e|ver, and not to &s;ee him again whil&s;t I live. You will meet with no &s;mall difficulties, to keep either of the&s;e Re&s;olutions, <HI>reply'd</HI> Albine; 'Tis not an ea&s;ie Matter to hate what one loves. I love him, <HI>cry'd the Counte&s;s with &s;ome impati|ence;</HI> 'Tis true, I have admitted of his impor|tunities, and this is the only thing I have to accu&s;e my &s;elf of, and to reproach you. How unfortunate are Per&s;ons of my Age, <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> if they happen to have Women of &s;o much Complai&s;ance as yours? Had&s;t thou given me a fore&s;ight of the Precipice I was going to, I had &s;top'd in time to avoid the Danger, and had not had any occa&s;ion now of finding my &s;elf betray'd: But in&s;tead of giving me whole|&s;ome Advice, thou made&s;t it thy Bu&s;ine&s;s to make me &s;en&s;ible of the Merits and Pa&s;&s;ion of my Enemy.</P>
<P>The&s;e various Reflections cau&s;ed in her a Thou|&s;and Melancholly Thoughts, which afflicted her to &s;uch a degree, that not being in a conditi|on to appear in any &s;trange Conpany, &s;he went to Bed, and <HI>Albine</HI> told the Family, that having a mo&s;t violent <HI>Head-ach,</HI> &s;he requir'd &s;ome Re&s;t. Her Husband, who did not que&s;tion but that it was an effect of her di&s;&s;atisfaction, was not ve|ry forward to &s;ee her, being highly exa&s;perated again&s;t her; and had it not bin for the Chevalier <HI>de Hereford,</HI> it would have come to a Rupture be|twixt them.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="170">
The Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> who bore a &s;hare in every thing that related to the Counte&s;s, &s;oon got Notice of her being ill of a <HI>Con&s;umptive Fe|ver,</HI> attended with &s;uch Symptoms of Melanchol|ly as &s;eem'd to be pa&s;t all hopes of a Cure, and not doubting but that it was that Change of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> that was the real Cau&s;e of it: What an odd Story is here! <HI>cry'd he,</HI> She Writes to him a Rigorous Letter, that &s;he will not as much as hear any body Name him; His good Fortune is &s;uch, as to take the right Cour&s;e, and to Cure his Pa&s;&s;ion; She no &s;ooner knows it, but is ready to run di&s;tracted. But perhaps, <HI>continued he,</HI> this &s;udden Fire which Burns now with &s;uch violence in her Heart for the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> may be much abated, if &s;he meets with a Lover who's Pa&s;&s;ion is limited within the Bounds of Vertue, &s;uch as &s;he has always profe&s;s'd; and 'tis po&s;&s;ible, that the Earl being too forward, forced that rigorous an&s;wer from her: As for my Part, I fear nothing of that kind; for as I love without hopes, &s;o I &s;hall be well plea&s;ed, provided &s;he will not be di&s;plea&s;ed with me.</P>
<P>There being a great Intimacy betwixt him and the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> he took often the free|dom of paying him a Vi&s;it at <HI>Twittenham;</HI> which being a Village but a few Miles from <HI>London,</HI> He ask'd leave of the King to go thither for &s;ome &s;mall time. You will then &s;ee the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire, &s;aid the King to him;</HI> I would have her come to Court again, becau&s;e I find her Beauty is much out of Order; I know her Eyes are grown very hollow, her Complexion and Lips Pale, and that &s;he is &s;o Lean, as &s;carce to be known to be the &s;ame Per&s;on: Thus I &s;ee my &s;elf &s;ufficiently Reveng'd upon her, and to compleat it, pray tell her, that I intend pri|vately
<PB N="164" REF="171">
to Marry Madam <HI>Grey;</HI> that I heap Fa|vours upon Favours upon her; that I love her mo&s;t Tenderly; and that if &s;he had u&s;ed me well, &s;he might Triumph'd at Court at Plea&s;ure, whereas, now her Husband keeps her &s;hut up in the Country.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty charges me with a Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> which would ea&s;ily break off my &s;mall Journey; For how is it po&s;&s;ible for me to put &s;uch hard&s;hips upon her? If you are re|&s;olved to go thither, <HI>added the King,</HI> it mu&s;t be to &s;erve me as an Interview to her. The Earl told him, He would do it in the mo&s;t Gen|tle way he could, and &s;o leaving the King's Apartment, met with the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> as he was pa&s;&s;ing through the Guard-Chamber: Having a mind to &s;ound his Inclinations con|cerning his former Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s, I am a going, <HI>&s;aid he with a low Voice,</HI> to lye at the Lady <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI>'s this Night, Have you any Commi&s;&s;ion to entru&s;t me with? The Earl being &s;omewhat Surprized, did not an&s;wer immediate|ly; but &s;oon after told him, he was a going to &s;ee a Fair, <HI>Little-Lyrne&s;s,</HI> and that he envy'd not his Fortune. You are angry, my Lord, <HI>re|ply'd the Earl of</HI> Pembrook, and I find there is more of Pa&s;&s;ion than of Indifferency, in that you &s;ay of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI> You know but little, <HI>return'd the Earl coldly,</HI> if this is your real Sentiment: Don't you know, that I am all of a Piece, and know not what Di&s;&s;embling is? The Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> having a mind to pry further into his Inclinations, told him, You think your &s;elf Cured, when you are &s;till very Sick. I am not &s;uch a Novice, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> not to know my own Condition; I read over her obliging Farewell every day, and it is there I meet with what is &s;ufficient to &s;upport my Rea|&s;on,
<PB N="165" REF="172">
and to augment my Scorn. Then you &s;till &s;tand in need of a Counterpoi&s;on, <HI>cry'd the Earl of</HI> Pembrook, you are not quite clear, &s;ay what you will. This is to in&s;ult over me, <HI>return'd the Earl with a &s;erious look;</HI> Sure you take me for a mean Spirited Fellow: I a&s;&s;ure you, I don't &s;o much as think any more of her. I knew &s;he was Ill, and I heard it not without &s;ome Satis|faction, which &s;ufficiently convinces me, that Thanks to Heaven, &s;he has no farther Power o|ver me: It were happy for me, <HI>added he,</HI> could I be Cured now as well of my Hatred, as I have bin of Love; I &s;hould then have but lit|tle occa&s;ion to di&s;pute with the King, as I now do about Madam <HI>Grey;</HI> and tho' he Adores her, I don't que&s;tion but to be Reveng'd of her, fir&s;t or la&s;t, according as a favourable opportunity of|fers. How, <HI>&s;aid the Earl of</HI> Pembrook, and do you &s;till keep in remembrance, what &s;he did a|gain&s;t you? I &s;hall never forgive her, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> till &s;he has well &s;uffer'd for it; and till then, I will give my &s;elf the Satisfaction of be|ing the mo&s;t Cruel of all her Enemies.</P>
<P>By this time, &s;everal Per&s;ons coming in to in|terrupt their Di&s;cour&s;e, the Earls of <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Pembrook</HI> parted, the la&s;t being extreamly well Satisfy'd at what he had heard his Rival &s;ay; But &s;carce was got down the Stairs when hear|ing him&s;elf call'd by &s;ome body, found it was the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> I Conjure you, <HI>&s;aid he to him,</HI> not to mi&s;s of this Opportunity of telling her, how far I am bewitch'd to my new Mi&s;tre&s;s; for I would have Madam <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> know, that her Fetters are not everla&s;ting; that I had Power enough to change them, nay, that I am almo&s;t incon&s;olable, to have ever worn them. That is enough for me, <HI>&s;aid my Lord</HI> Pembrook, to tell her, what will plea&s;e her much. And why
<PB N="166" REF="173">
plea&s;e her, <HI>&s;aid the Earl of</HI> Warwick? That is the lea&s;t of my intention. I am Satisfy'd, <HI>&s;aid the Earl of</HI> Pembrook, <HI>with a Malicious Smile,</HI> She will be overjoy'd to hear you think of her no more. The Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> not being a|ble to contain him&s;elf, told him with a deep Sigh, Alas! my Lord, how happy are you, not to be in Love with this Cruel Woman; I wou'd I never knew her, or at lea&s;t never lov'd her, at the Price of half my Life: But Farewell, I mu&s;t leave you, the Recital of my weakne&s;s would prove to my Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid the&s;e Words, he went up to the King, whil&s;t the Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> remain'd im|moveable, leaning again&s;t the Wall, quite con|founded at the la&s;t Words of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> not que&s;tioning, but that he had flattered him|&s;elf in vain: 'Tis certain, <HI>&s;aid he to him&s;elf,</HI> he is &s;till affected with the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion, and 'tis nothing but &s;elf-love, that makes him de&s;pi&s;e her who de&s;pi&s;es him; For, how is it po&s;&s;ible, that &s;o Ardent a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould be quite extingui&s;h'd at once? Perhaps, when the Counte&s;s Writ what &s;he did, it was not without the greate&s;t violence to her &s;elf; how can I tell, whither not &s;ome indi&s;pen&s;i|ble Rea&s;ons obliged her to it? O God! What Torments do I endure! What Ob&s;tacles am I like|ly to encounter! What difficulties am I not to Surmount! Whether am I a going? My Fetters being already &s;o weighty, if I &s;ee the Counte&s;s and declare my Pa&s;&s;ion to her, and &s;he &s;hould be offend|ed thereat, &s;hould I not then be much more unfor|tunate than I am now?</P>
<P>A Thou&s;and objections came into his Head a|gain&s;t the intended Journey to <HI>Twittenham;</HI> but at la&s;t, let my Treatment be what it will, I &s;hall have at lea&s;t the Satisfaction of having declared my Pa&s;&s;ion to her; &s;o, that if I &s;uffer, &s;he'll know 'tis for
<PB N="167" REF="174">
her I &s;uffer, and of all the Misfortunes, this is greate&s;t, to Love and to Conceal it. Whil&s;t he was taking this Re&s;olution, he e&s;py'd my Lord <HI>Stanley,</HI> and ask'd him, whether they &s;hould not go together to <HI>Twittenham?</HI> He embraced the of|fer, and they were received with &s;ingular kind|ne&s;s by the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> who was very glad of good Company, to divert his Spleen, which mo&s;t afflicted him when he was alone.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> did not &s;ee the Coun|te&s;s that Night, becau&s;e &s;he did not &s;tir out of her Chamber; and if without being Guilty of ill Manners &s;he could have refu&s;ed the Vi&s;its of tho&s;e that came to her Father's Hou&s;e, &s;he would have bin extreamly glad of it. The Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> ask'd how &s;he did, and told my Lord <HI>Stanley,</HI> to per&s;wade her not to u&s;e &s;o much Re&s;ervedne&s;s to him as &s;he did to o|thers; Put her in mind, <HI>&s;aid he &s;miling,</HI> that it was upon her Command, I left you in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Fair <HI>Lelia,</HI> and don't you think it not rea&s;onable &s;he &s;hould &s;hew &s;ome particu|lar Regard to me? My Lord &s;aid &s;he ought, and promis'd to introduce him to his Si&s;ter's Apartment the next Morning &s;o &s;oon as &s;he &s;hould be awake.</P>
<P>To perform his Promi&s;e, he went to a little Wood, where the Earl had bin pa&s;&s;ing his time ever &s;ince day-break, near a Cool Spring, where the Counte&s;s u&s;ed often to divert her &s;elf; He &s;aw <HI>Aurora</HI> di&s;&s;ipating by degrees the darkne&s;s of the Night, whil&s;t the Sweet Singing Birds &s;eem'd to revive Nature it &s;elf, during the Cold|ne&s;s of the Morning, when the Sun Beams being as yet feeble, rather delighted than offended the Eyes. The Earl addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to the Stars, and told them his Pain and Perplexity; He would have thought his Condition &s;ufficiently happy to find him&s;elf in the &s;ame place, where
<PB N="168" REF="175">
his admir'd Counte&s;s had her Habitation, had &s;he bin more &s;en&s;ible for him, or le&s;s for another; but this Reflection was like to kill him upon the &s;pot, had it not bin that he remembred tho&s;e few cruel Words &s;he writ to the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> This being the only Foundation whereon he built the hopes of his Succe&s;s, in the intended Declaration of his Love.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Stanley</HI> finding him among a Set, or kind of Arbour of Trees, near a <HI>Ca&s;cade,</HI> in a very pen&s;ive Po&s;ture, told him, I am &s;orry, my Lord, if I di&s;turb your Thoughts; becau&s;e I am &s;en&s;ible, your Mind is taken up with &s;omething that touches you very near. The Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> &s;igh'd, and without an&s;wer|ing his Que&s;tion, only told him with a forc'd Smile, That Indifferency was the happie&s;t thing in the World. I ea&s;ily gue&s;s at your meaning, <HI>return'd my Lord</HI> Stanley; you are in Love, and have rea&s;on of Complaint. The Earl fearing he might dive too far into his Sentiments, thought fit to divert him, by making him his pretended Confident, and relating to him an old Adventure of his, as if it were one of a very late Date.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own to you, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> That to forget the ingrateful <HI>Lelia,</HI> I re&s;olv'd to enter into an Amorous Engagement, in good earne&s;t, with a Lady who might really de&s;erve it; 'Twas not long before I got acquainted with a Widow, a mo&s;t Charming Creature; who, tho' &s;he was pa&s;s'd the fir&s;t Flower of her Youth, yet &s;till retain'd a thou&s;and Beauties, who&s;e Lu&s;tre was encreas'd by her lively Wit and mo&s;t enga|ging Conver&s;ation: She gave me great De|mon&s;trations of her E&s;teem, tho' &s;he pretended to a mo&s;t &s;evere Virtue; but in hopes that time would produce more favourable Sentiments
<PB N="169" REF="176">
in her, I Courted her with all the Ardour and Application that could be: But one Day hap|pening to come to her Hou&s;e, when &s;he did not expect me, I enter'd the Door, and in a great Lookingla&s;s that hung in her Bed-chamber and faced the Entry, I e&s;py'd a certain young Pedaut, who being lately come out of &s;ome Univer&s;ity-Colledge, &s;he had made a Tutor to her Son; if you had but &s;een his lank gree&s;y Hair, you mu&s;t have own'd he would make but a very loth&s;ome Bed-fellow for &s;o Nice a Lady; be|&s;ides that, his Face was &s;o ugly, as was enough to frighten me: So away I went immediately, but did not forget to write her every thing that Anger could in&s;pire me with, and to give her to under&s;tand the rea&s;on of it, and my con&s;tant Aver&s;ion to &s;uch pretended Virtuous Ladies. She touch'd to the quick, and think|ing it le&s;s Di&s;advantagious to make me her Con|fident, than to let me have a &s;ini&s;ter Opinion of her Virtue, &s;ent to me one of her Relations, being the only Per&s;on that was Privy to her Marriage with this Fellow, who gave me a full Account of it. I prote&s;t to you, that I was more &s;urpriz'd at this than at the fir&s;t; but you may believe I made the be&s;t u&s;e of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> was to Cure my &s;elf of my Pa&s;&s;ion, it being contrary to my Inclinations, to love what I can't e&s;teem: However, I am forced to offer con&s;tant Violences to my Heart, and have taken a po&s;itive Re&s;o|lution, to avoid all Lady's as the Bane of our Tranquillity; and whenever I feel but the lea&s;t Inclination for any one, I am &s;ure I will never &s;ee her again whil&s;t I live.</P>
<P>You threaten the Fair Sex very hard, and I believe more than you are able to perform, <HI>re|ply'd my Lord</HI> Stanley. I think we may both defie them, <HI>&s;aid the Earl abruptly.</HI> My Si&s;ter
<PB N="170" REF="177">
will give you a favourable Reception, <HI>reply'd my Lord,</HI> if &s;he be but acquainted with your Re|&s;olution. How! <HI>return'd the Earl,</HI> Would &s;he not have one Love that which is lovely? No, <HI>added my Lord,</HI> &s;he is &s;uch an Enemy of all man|ner of Gallantry, that nothing can be more ter|rible than &s;he to a Lover: Come then, let us go to &s;ee her, and do you make her &s;en&s;ible of your rare Re&s;olution. Had my Lord bin &s;en&s;ible what Affections the&s;e Words caus'd in his Friend, he would have acted with more Caution, and he might &s;oon have di&s;cover'd the Symptoms thereof in his very Eyes, had he but look'd at him; but little gue&s;&s;ing at his Intentions, he thought no further on the matter.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> was going to|wards the Counte&s;s's Apartment, he was op|pre&s;s'd with &s;uch a Confu&s;ion of Thoughts as is &s;carce to be expre&s;s'd: Are not my Chains already weighty enough, <HI>&s;aid he to him&s;elf?</HI> Mu&s;t I go to &s;ee her, to augment my Pa&s;&s;ion? And can I flatter my &s;elf that the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> is ab|&s;olutely indifferent to her? 'Tis true, &s;he has writ to him in har&s;h Terms; but ala&s;s! this may be the effect of Anger, Jealou&s;y, or &s;ome Error committed by him; the&s;e things are &s;oon pa&s;s'd by, when a Per&s;on truly loves; &s;o that the Re|&s;olution I have taken of di&s;clo&s;ing to her my Pa&s;&s;ion, may prove perhaps the mo&s;t fatal Acti|on of my Life. He was a thou&s;and times upon the point of changing his dangerous Re&s;olution; but the Plea&s;ure he propos'd to him&s;elf, got the better over all the Con&s;iderations of Danger; and thus as he was entring the Counte&s;s's Bed-Chamber, he had much a-do to forbear running &s;traightways to the Fair Lady's Bed-&s;ide, where &s;he appear'd in a negligent Dre&s;s, attired with no|thing but her own Charms, with &s;omewhat a

Pale Countenance, enough to di&s;cover her Grief; but in the mid&s;t of her Langui&s;hment, there ap|pear'd &s;till &s;uch a Lu&s;tre in her Eyes, as prov'd dangerous in effect, to all that beheld them.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> is come to tell you &s;ome|thing that will charm you, <HI>&s;aid my Lord</HI> Stanley, <HI>as he was entring her Chamber;</HI> He hates Love, and flies all Opportunities relating to it; he is got away from Court to &s;eek for &s;helter here. I am afraid I have not cho&s;en my Ground very well to Fight in, <HI>reply'd the Earl, interrupting him;</HI> But, Madam, my Lord talks at random, he ought to tell you the Rea&s;ons that engag'd me into the&s;e Re&s;olutions, which I intend to ju&s;tify to you alone. Keep to your Re&s;oluti|on, <HI>reply'd the Counte&s;s,</HI> to love no more, don't alter your De&s;ign; and if my Brother would follow my Advice, I would have him do &s;o too. I don't de&s;ire to Engage you, whil&s;t you have &s;uch a Second, <HI>&s;aid my Lord</HI> Stanley <HI>to his Si&s;ter:</HI> Adieu, I am a going a Hunting, and if I meet with &s;ome Solitary Place, it may be I may be&s;tow the Day there upon my Thoughts: So he went out of the Room, leaving the Earl at full Liberty to entertain the Counte&s;s. 'Tis certain 'twas the only thing in the World the Earl was de&s;irous of, yet found him&s;elf at a &s;tand; for tho' he knew very well what he in|tended to &s;ay, he knew not whether &s;he would mind it; &s;o their Conver&s;ation was at fir&s;t upon indifferent matters.</P>
<P>By your Ab&s;ence, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> the Court is robb'd of its chiefe&s;t Ornament; every thing looks very Melancholly there, &s;ince you have left it.

<P>At the&s;e Words, the Counte&s;s not que&s;tion|ing, but that the &s;ame Letter which was re&s;tor'd to her by the <HI>Chevalier de Hereford,</HI> was al&s;o faln into the Hands of the Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> &s;he was &s;o afflicted thereat, as to break forth into Tears.

My Lord, <HI>&s;aid the Counte&s;s, inter|rupting him,</HI> you have taken too much the Ad|vantage of the Confu&s;ion and Trouble you &s;aw me in; you have told me what highly di&s;|plea&s;es me, and what convinces me more and more in my Opinion, that there is not a more unfortunate Per&s;on upon Earth than my &s;elf: Were the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> of a more honour|able Temper, than he is, he would not have forgotten to tell you when he &s;poke of our Conver&s;ation, that I never gave him any oc|ca&s;ion of bragging of his good Fortune, and that I omitted nothing to deliver my &s;elf from his Per&s;ecutions: But that fatal Star, which be&s;tow'd upon me &s;omething of Beauty, did it doubtle&s;s to my De&s;truction; it would be more happy for me to be hated by all the World, than to be belov'd after the &s;ame manner I am now: But be it as it will, my Lord, I have too high an E&s;teem for you to quarrel with you; I will forget every thing you told me, provided you promi&s;e not to &s;ee me any more.

No, no, I am not any more thus far Ma&s;ter of my own Actions, as to engage my Word for a thing of &s;uch a nature: Alas! what is it I have not en|dur'd &s;ince I &s;aw you in the Wood near <HI>Chel|&s;ea,</HI>

<P>This Indifferency, or rather Slight, more near|ly affected the Earl, than if &s;he had broken out into violent Expre&s;&s;ions; Oh!

The Earl took his Seat, but &s;poke not one Word more, &s;o that this dumb Conver&s;ation beginning to prove tedious, he aro&s;e on a &s;udden, made a profound Reverence, and &s;o left her Chamber, and immediately after, the Hou&s;e, finding him|&s;elf not in a Condition, to carry on matters there without danger of being di&s;cover'd by &s;ome of the Family in his Intentions.</P>
<P>He came not to <HI>London</HI> till it was late, that he might the better keep conceal'd for &s;ome Days in his own Hou&s;e; which time he &s;pent in endeavouring to calm the Tempe&s;t in his Mind: After that he came to Court, where he met with a favourable Reception from the King, who ask'd him, whether he had acquitted him&s;elf of the Commi&s;&s;ion he had charg'd him with?

The Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> who had rea&s;on enough to wi&s;h that his Ma&s;ter might think of her no more, <HI>reply'd,</HI> She was &s;carce to be known, and that it &s;eem'd almo&s;t not natural for &s;o Hand&s;ome a Per&s;on to grow &s;o Ugly.

<P>The Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> being very well inclin'd to execute the King's Command, went immediate|ly to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who receiv'd him with all the Marks of a tender Friend&s;hip: What News do you bring me, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> from Madam <HI>De|von&s;hire,</HI> Is &s;he &s;till in the &s;ame Humour again&s;t me?

I have &s;ince made many &s;erious Reflections upon every particular relating to that Affair, <HI>added the Earl of</HI> Warwick, and find nothing but matter of Trouble and Vexation in it: You know what I have told you before, upon that Head; I never enjoy'd one Day with Content; I was forc'd to hazard every thing, to get &s;ight of her but for one Moment, and that even again&s;t her Con&s;ent; I was &s;urrounded by the King and the General on one &s;ide, and by her Husband and Madam <HI>Grey</HI> on the other; Judge what a &s;ort of Entertainment this was, for one not ac|quainted with Di&s;appointments: However, I lov'd her too well, to be check'd by the&s;e Difficulties, none but her &s;elf could have alter'd my Re&s;olu|tion; you know how &s;he managed the matter, and what a mo&s;t gracious Farewel &s;he be&s;tow'd upon me, whil&s;t I &s;uffer'd &s;uch a har&s;h Bani&s;hment upon her account: All the&s;e Rea&s;ons have had &s;uch an Influence upon me, that I begin to reli&s;h the Sweets of a real Indifferency; add to this my Engagement with a lovely Per&s;on, who treats me as well as the Counte&s;s did ill, you can't but agree with me, That I could not do better, than to take a fix'd Re&s;olution of con&s;ulting my own Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> hearken'd to his Words with a great deal of Plea&s;ure; Oh! <HI>&s;aid he to him|&s;elf,</HI> and why &s;hould the Fair Counte&s;s not be acquainted with the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s Indiffe|rency for her?

Whil&s;t every thing was in Tranquillity at Court, fre&s;h matter of Vexation aro&s;e at <HI>Twittenham;</HI> The Chevalier <HI>de Hereford,</HI> we have had occa&s;ion to mention before, being of the &s;ame Family with the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> a mutual Confidence and Friend&s;hip had bin contracted betwixt them: But to render this durable, the Chevalier mu&s;t either never have &s;een the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> or prov'd le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of her Charms. He look'd upon the fir&s;t beginning of his Pa&s;&s;ion, only as an Effect of Compa&s;&s;ion for her; knowing that a Woman of &s;o haughty a Temper as &s;he, mu&s;t needs re&s;ent highly, the unju&s;t Jealou&s;ies of a Husband. When he &s;aw the Letter &s;he writ to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> this augmented his E&s;teem, &s;eeing &s;he intended to check his Pa&s;&s;ion, and that if &s;he had a particular Value for him before others, her Heart neverthele&s;s had kept it &s;elf within the &s;tricte&s;t Rules of her Duty. The&s;e confus'd Thoughts by degrees being met in good Order, he look'd upon the Counte&s;s as the mo&s;t Beautiful Per&s;on in the World, who being &s;hut up in the Country, might by little and little be accu&s;tom'd to hearken to his Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>'Twas this that made him &s;o anxious in taking that occa&s;ion of &s;etting her at Variance with the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> for a Secret Lover has gain'd a good Step, if he can remove the Per&s;on belov'd by his Mi&s;tre&s;s.

Several Months pa&s;s'd thus, the Chevalier being not as yet fully acquainted with his own Senti|ments.

On the other Hand, the Counte&s;s &s;hewing him a Thou&s;and inno|cent Marks of her Friend&s;hip, to acquire his, each of the&s;e prov'd a Snare, wherein the Chevalier &s;aw him&s;elf entangled pa&s;t all Hopes of get|ting out: For upon his return <HI>London,</HI> where he intended to &s;tay for &s;ome time, every thing prov'd as irk&s;ome to him, as if he had bin in a &s;trange Country; his only &s;atis|faction in the World now being, to &s;ee the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>All this while, he loaded him&s;elf with a Thou|&s;and Reproaches, to abu&s;e thus the Friend&s;hip of the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> his Dear Kin&s;man, who had open'd his very Bo&s;om to him; No, would he cry &s;ometimes, I will &s;ee her no more, I will choo&s;e a voluntary Bani&s;hment from that Hou&s;e, where my Reception is &s;uch as to di&s;turb all my Repo&s;e.

<P>Tho' you are very much mi&s;taken in your Gue&s;s, <HI>&s;aid the Counte&s;s, interrupting him,</HI> I think my &s;elf neverthele&s;s oblig'd to your Conduct, both in re|&s;pect of my Husband and my &s;elf; but I can a&s;&s;ure you, were you le&s;s prejudic'd than you are, or better acquainted with my pre&s;ent Inclinations, you would not accu&s;e me, as you do, of &s;o much Weakne&s;s, to return any favourable Sentiments for the mo&s;t di&s;honourable Per&s;on in the World; Nay, I would &s;ooner have pardon'd him, for having contriv'd my Death, than for having endeavour'd to &s;tain my Reputation in the World: Then you don't love him, <HI>reply'd the Chevalier &s;ighing?</HI> I hate him pa&s;s'd all recovery, <HI>&s;aid &s;he.</HI> If it be &s;o, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> May I hope for nothing from your Compa&s;&s;ion?

I prote&s;t to you, I can &s;carce believe it; and that of all Mankind, who are &s;ub|ject to &s;uch Frailties, you were the la&s;t one I &s;u&s;|pected in that kind.

<P>Alas! <HI>Albine, &s;aid &s;he to her, full of Trouble,</HI> what a &s;trange Scene has bin acted here! my Misfortunes, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, encrea&s;e every Moment: The <HI>Chevalier de Hereford</HI> has made to me &s;uch a Declaration, as puts me quite beyond my &s;elf; him I look'd upon as my be&s;t Friend, but he proves as indi&s;creet as the Earl of <HI>Pembrook;</HI> be&s;ides, I am under a great Dilemma how to deal with him; for if I u&s;e him roughly, he will perhaps be re|vengeful, and you know my Lord hearkens to, and believes every thing he &s;ays; if I &s;hew him &s;ome Complai&s;ance, What Con&s;truction will he make of my Indulgence? and what is it I mu&s;t not fear hereafter? This will render my Condition but wor&s;e; and after all, Am I Mi&s;tre&s;s of my own Heart? Of that Heart, I &s;ay, &s;o often revolts again&s;t all the Dictates of my Rea&s;on? Which is &s;o very frail, as to make me to this Day, di&s;cover &s;ome Merit in my mo&s;t Mortal Enemy: Yes, <HI>Al|bine,</HI> 'Tis not is my power to hate the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> How Happy am I in not &s;eeing
<PB N="184" REF="191">
him! How much am I in Love with this Solitude! 'Tis true, I &s;uffer here, but no mat|ter, as long as I pre&s;erve here my Inno|cency.</P>
<P>Hitherto <HI>Albine</HI> dur&s;t not &s;peak in behalf of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> for her Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;eeming &s;o high|ly exa&s;perated again&s;t him, &s;he did not believe he had retain'd &s;o good a Place in her Heart, as &s;he found he did, &s;o &s;he would not neglect this Oppor|tunity; Perhaps, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> Madam, the Earl is not &s;o guilty, as he has bin repre&s;ented to you; Re|member now, it was the Chevalier <HI>de Hereford,</HI> who render'd him thus Criminal in your Eyes; and is it not very probable, that at that very time he might have his Secret De&s;igns of ruining him in your Opinion? No, no, <HI>cry'd the Counte&s;s,</HI> I re|main unalterable in re&s;pect to the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> his Behaviour has bin &s;uch, that I mu&s;t be Blinder than any Woman in the World, to be de|ceiv'd in it; Neither do I deceive my &s;elf, <HI>continu'd &s;he;</HI> I only deplore the Exce&s;s of my Misfortunes, that I &s;hould meet with &s;o many Enemies, among&s;t tho&s;e very Per&s;ons who owe me the mo&s;t Re&s;pect. She then kept Silence in a pen&s;ive Po&s;ture, without giving the lea&s;t At|tention or An&s;wer to what <HI>Albine</HI> further told her.</P>
<P>Immediately after, the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> com|ing into the Chamber, and &s;eeing the dangerous State of his Kin&s;man, was much afflicted thereat, and being the only Per&s;on whom he had made the Confident of his Jealou&s;y, he re&s;olv'd to go along with him to <HI>London,</HI> and to &s;tay there till his full Recovery. He told the Counte&s;s that he in|tended to go to <HI>London,</HI> becau&s;e he &s;hould not enjoy him&s;elf in the Country, if he &s;hould let him go alone; and that, if his Di&s;temper &s;hould prove of any long Continuance, he de&s;ir'd Madam <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="192">
and her, to come to Town likewi&s;e: She an&s;wer'd coldly, that he might have di&s;pens'd him&s;elf from going, by committing him to the Care of &s;ome tru&s;ty Per&s;on; But that he was his own Ma&s;ter, and that her Credit was &s;o incon&s;iderable with him, that &s;he dur&s;t not attempt to engage him to &s;tay at <HI>Twittenham.</HI> He gave her a &s;urly Look, and without &s;peaking one Word, went out of the Room. Soon after, hearing a Noi&s;e in the Court, &s;he found it was the Chevalier <HI>de Hereford</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> both upon their Departure for <HI>London,</HI> the fir&s;t in a Hor&s;e-Litter, and the other in his Coach. They were no &s;ooner arriv'd there, but the Earls of <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Pembrook</HI> being the fir&s;t that got Notice thereof, this &s;erv'd to revive their Pa&s;&s;ions: For the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> could not flatter him&s;elf to &s;peak to the Counte&s;s, as long as her Husband <HI>Argus-</HI>like watch'd her him|&s;elf; and the Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> imagin'd, that be|ing now at Liberty, &s;he would enjoy the Advan|tage thereof, and afford him a more favourable Reception.</P>
<P>He was &s;o far from making the lea&s;t Mi&s;tery of his intended Journey to <HI>Twittenham,</HI> that he vi&s;ited the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> upon that account, who gave him &s;ome Letters to his Lady; However, he conceal'd it from the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> whom he &s;till look'd upon as his Rival; notwith&s;tanding the Hatred he bore to Madam <HI>Grey,</HI> and the Pains he took to encompa&s;s her Ruin, &s;eem'd to divert his Pa&s;&s;ion a contrary way. As &s;he was not igno|rant of all the Steps he took for that end, and on her &s;ide repay'd him in the &s;ame Coin; the King was con&s;tantly troubled with the Complaints of his Favourite again&s;t his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and with hers again&s;t him. He was engag'd in the &s;ame Intere&s;t with Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Lucy,</HI> a Lady of Quality, and
<PB N="186" REF="193">
of extraordinary Beauty: The King, whil&s;t he was yet Earl of <HI>Marche,</HI> enter'd into an Amorous Intrigue with her, which was not interrupted by the Lu&s;tre of his Crown; but the Charms both of Mind and Body, join'd in the Per&s;on of Madam <HI>Grey,</HI> did not a little dazzle and prevail over tho&s;e of the young Mrs. <HI>Lucy.</HI> She re&s;ented the matter like an injur'd Mi&s;tre&s;s, and would fre|quently engage the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> to give the King an account of the &s;ini&s;ter Conduct of Madam <HI>Grey:</HI> But this coming from a &s;u&s;pected Hand, whom he knew to be her Enemy, the King would &s;ay, This lovely Widow is faithful to me; Why would you have me check my Pa&s;&s;ion for her? And who can you think of, &s;hould be the Per&s;on, &s;he would prefer before me? If Love and Rea&s;on did always go Hand in Hand, <HI>reply'd the Earl,</HI> your Maje&s;ty might re&s;t a&s;&s;ur'd, that Madam <HI>Grey</HI> was &s;en&s;ible of her Good Fortune, and that what I &s;ay again&s;t her, was not con&s;onant to Truth; but, Sir, Love is Blind; put her to the Trial, and to &s;uch a one as may put it beyond all Doubt, that you are in full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Heart, or at lea&s;t, that may ju&s;tify her Conduct. The King tir'd out with the&s;e repeated Accu&s;ations, told him one Day, That he ow'd him no Obligation for the Trouble he gave him&s;elf. I de&s;ire no Reward from your Maje&s;ty, <HI>reply'd he, with a great deal of Frankne&s;s;</HI> but I &s;hall at lea&s;t have the &s;atisfaction of having done my Duty. Oh! <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> your Zeal is very trouble&s;ome, you may &s;hew it upon other Occa&s;ions, and not di&s;turb me any further in Mat|ters relating to my Mi&s;tre&s;s. But all this did not check the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s Re&s;olution, he often told the King many things of her, which prov'd mo&s;t generally fal&s;e, but at the &s;ame time furni&s;h'd no &s;mall matter of Vexation to the Fair Widow;
<PB N="187" REF="194">
and what mo&s;t of all afflicted her, was, that he was ready upon all Occa&s;ions, to extol the Merits of Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Lucy,</HI> who &s;he fear'd might one time or other alienate the King's Inclinations from her; &s;o that &s;he was at open Enmity with the Earl.</P>
<P>Thus matters went at Court, when the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and the Chevalier <HI>de Hereford</HI> came to <HI>London:</HI> The Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who &s;till retain'd in his mind the Charms of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon|&s;hire,</HI> and who mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired to &s;peak with her, to reproach her Rigour, and to recover his Credit with her, if it were not entirely lo&s;t, would certainly have given her a vi&s;it at <HI>Twitten|ham,</HI> had it not bin, that he look'd upon the de|&s;truction of Madam <HI>Grey,</HI> as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential point on which depended both his Repo&s;e and Grandure: He had already made &s;uch &s;teps to|wards her removal from the King's Favour, as would have proved infallible with any other Per&s;on except the King, quite prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an high Opinion of her; but being dayly in hopes of finding out &s;omething that might tend to the di&s;advantage of his Enemy, he delay'd his Journey to <HI>Twittenham</HI> for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> had al&s;o not laid a&s;ide his de&s;ign, being de&s;irous to dive into tho&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> entred into di&s;cour&s;e with him concerning my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire;</HI> and the Earl not in the lea&s;t imagining that he talk'd to his Rival, told him, without the lea&s;t re&s;erve, that, were it not for &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence, he had at Court, he would endeavour to &s;ee the fair Counte&s;s in Di&s;gui&s;e. <HI>Pembrook</HI> overjoy'd to find the Earl employ'd otherwi&s;e, re&s;olved not to lo&s;e a moment, to accompli&s;h the de&s;ign he had
<PB N="188" REF="195">
laid of carrying away the Counte&s;s to one of his Seats, where he intended to keep her &s;ecretly as long as po&s;&s;ibly he could, with|out hearkening to, or valuing the Danger, which his Rea&s;on laid before him: For he was in Love, and that is all as can be &s;aid in his Ju&s;ti|fication.</P>
<P>To encompa&s;s his end, he had cau&s;ed a kind of a Barge to be built, finely Painted and Guilded, after the &s;ame manner as they were &s;aid to be u&s;ed in the <HI>Indies,</HI> that &s;o having nothing of the <HI>Euro|pean</HI> Modal in it, the Ladies might be &s;urprized with its Novelty, as well as with the Habit of him, who was the pretended Ma&s;ter thereof, who repre&s;ented both in his Garb, Actions and Looks, an <HI>Engli&s;h Indian</HI> Merchant, lately come from tho&s;e Parts. The Di&s;gui&s;ed Earl, was no &s;ooner got up the River with his Barge as far as <HI>Twitten|ham,</HI> but he &s;ent his Interpreter to invite the Counte&s;&s;es of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> a-board her, to take a view of what Rarities he had to di&s;po&s;e of. Accordingly they came a-board her the next Day, where their Eyes being glutted with great variety of Rich <HI>Indian</HI> Stuffs and other Rarities, the Merchant told the young Counte&s;s, That if She would come without her Mother the next day, he would &s;hew and &s;ell her the Riche&s;t Silks that ever &s;he &s;aw in her Life. And why would not you have my Mother come along with me, <HI>&s;aid &s;he?</HI> Becau&s;e, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> at my departure from the <HI>In|dies,</HI> I made a Vow to our Gods, not to di&s;po&s;e of any of the&s;e riche&s;t Stuffs, but to young Per&s;ons. The Counte&s;s laugh'd at the Merchant's Fancy, and did not come again the next following day; &s;o her Curio&s;ity brought her thither the Day after, attended only by &s;ome few of her Wo|men.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="196">
Whil&s;t &s;he was bu&s;ie in viewing and picking out what &s;he lik'd be&s;t, they had Hoi&s;ted Sail, and the Barge went forward a-pace, before &s;he perceiv'd it; but dreaming of nothing, ask'd the <HI>Indian-</HI>Merchant, Whether they were a going. To the <HI>Indies,</HI> Madam, <HI>reply'd he:</HI> The Emperor my Ma|&s;ter &s;ent me on purpo&s;e to carry you to him. The Counte&s;s laugh'd at it, taking it for a Je&s;t; but perceiving they went on as fa&s;t as they could, &s;he began to be frighten'd in good Earne&s;t. Don't think to carry me any further, if you do, I will kill my &s;elf. The Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> &s;eeing her &s;o re&s;olute, told her, Madam, don't fear; 'tis the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> who has &s;ent me, he mu&s;t either &s;ee you or dye; and he has order'd me to convey you to &s;ome delicious Place, where you will &s;ee him more Amorous and more Faithful than ever.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s more enrag'd than before, told him, She would not &s;ee him while &s;he liv'd; and that before they could bring her to the Place where the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was, &s;he would either Drown or Kill her &s;elf with her own Hands. The Exce&s;s of her De&s;pair di&s;cover'd it &s;elf, both in her Countenance and Actions; 'tis true, &s;he did not Cry, but ca&s;ting mo&s;t furious Looks to the Water, &s;hew'd that &s;he aim'd at the River. The Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> lay at her Feet, not daring to di&s;cover him&s;elf for fear of encrea&s;ing her Fury; but did all he could to appea&s;e it, telling her, He would carry her back to <HI>Twittenham,</HI> if &s;he was po&s;i|tively bent upon it. She vouch&s;afed him not one Word, but on a &s;udden threw her &s;elf into the <HI>Thames.</HI> Good God! What a &s;urprize was this to her Pa&s;&s;ionate Lover! He little thought &s;he would have taken &s;o fatal a Re&s;olution, and now de&s;pi&s;ing his own Life, leap'd in after her: Being a
<PB N="190" REF="197">
good Swimmer he &s;oon got hold of her Gown, as &s;he was ri&s;ing in the Water; but not with&s;tanding this, they had both bin drown'd together, had not &s;ome of their Water-men come timely to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Women of her Attendence, &s;eeing their Mi&s;tre&s;s without Sen&s;e or Motion, &s;ent forth mo&s;t doleful Cries to Heaven: And the Earl of <HI>Pem|brook</HI> &s;eeing, that &s;ince the Plot would not take under the Name of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> there was but little Hopes for him; re&s;olv'd, without di&s;covering him&s;elf, to &s;et the Counte&s;s down where he had taken her up. Madam, <HI>&s;aid he to her, after &s;he was come to her &s;elf again,</HI> you need not have thus hazarded your Life, by throwing your &s;elf into the River, to force me to turn back to <HI>Twittenham;</HI> our Intention was, to make you Happy, but &s;ince you're again&s;t it, there is no rea|&s;on we &s;hould incur your Hatred, when our Bu&s;i|ne&s;s was to de&s;erve your Good-will: Live, Ma|dam, Live for a Jealous Husband; fly your true&s;t Friend; 'tis your ill Star that Rules you, and you will have occa&s;ion enough to repent of it hereafter. Away, away, Impo&s;tor, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> go and try your Skill upon &s;ome le&s;s Virtuous or more Credulous Per&s;on than my &s;elf; and thank Heavens, I am of the weaker Sex, or el&s;e I would make you feel the Effects of my ju&s;t Re&s;entment, for the Game you were going to play me. Whil&s;t they were talking thus, they were got &s;o near the Bank of the River, that by the help of a long Plank, the Counte&s;s and her Women could get conveniently out of the Barge; the Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> having chang'd his <HI>Indian</HI> Habit for that of an <HI>European,</HI> did the &s;ame not long after on the oppo&s;ite Side; and Night approaching, gave them an Opportunity of unloading the Cargo, and
<PB N="191" REF="198">
having &s;et Fire to the Ve&s;&s;el, they all got to <HI>London;</HI> without which they might have &s;oon bin di&s;cover'd and taken by the Country Peo|ple.</P>
<P>In effect the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> her &s;elf, im|mediately prepar'd her &s;elf again&s;t the ill Con&s;e|quences, which &s;he fore&s;aw would attend this At|tempt: For &s;ome of the Inhabitants of <HI>Twitten|ham,</HI> had &s;een her go into the Barge, which im|mediately made the be&s;t of her Way down the River; others had &s;een her plunge her &s;elf into the River, and the <HI>Indian-</HI>Merchant after her; all which cau&s;ing no &s;mall &s;urprize, the News thereof was &s;oon carry'd to the Earl of <HI>Angle&s;ey.</HI> The old Counte&s;s unea&s;ie, to know what was become of her Daughter, run to the River-&s;ide, where &s;he found her Wet all over, ju&s;t after &s;he was &s;carce well got out of the Boat, and ask'd her very abruptly, What a fine Walk &s;he had taken. The young Counte&s;s appear'd much di&s;compos'd, which creating a Su&s;picion in her Mother, &s;he told her without &s;taying for her An&s;wer, She had play'd &s;ome Trick of Youth, wherein Love had a greater Share than Rea&s;on. I prote&s;t to you, Madam, <HI>reply'd the Counte&s;s of</HI> Devon&s;hire, you do me the greate&s;t piece of Inju&s;tice in the World; you have taken a Prejudice again&s;t me, were it not &s;o, you would believe what I am a going to relate to you concerning this Ad|venture; but I am almo&s;t a&s;&s;ured you will not give credit to what I &s;ay. You ought not to be Judge of my Thoughts, <HI>an&s;wer'd my Lady</HI> Angle&s;ey, &s;peak only, and I &s;hall &s;oon gue&s;s whether you are &s;incere or not. In the Condition I am now in, <HI>added &s;he,</HI> it will not be proper to give the whole Recital thereof imme|diately, but I will ju&s;tify my &s;elf, when we
<PB N="192" REF="199">
come to your Apartment. So they got into the Coach, the young Counte&s;s being in &s;uch a Confu&s;ion, as if &s;he had bin actually Guilty; tho' every thing con&s;ider'd, e&s;pecially her attempt|ing to drown her &s;elf, there was but little cau&s;e of &s;u&s;pecting her to have had a Hand in the Plot.</P>
<P>She was no &s;ooner got Home, but &s;he went to Bed, where &s;he felt her Mind di&s;tracted with a Thou&s;and Reflections concerning the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> the attempt he had made appearing to her unpardonable, according to the Rules of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Good Manners:</HI> To carry away a marry'd Lady of her Quality and Conduct, appear'd to be &s;o Pre&s;umptuous an Action, as could not take ri&s;e but from a Love without Bounds. She fancy'd &s;he &s;aw him at her Feet, vowing an Eternal Re&s;pect to her; and to excu&s;e him&s;elf on account of his Love, to have bin wanting in it: Notwith&s;tanding which, &s;he remain'd much exa&s;perated again&s;t him. How! to carry me away by force, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to the old</HI> Albine, what an Opinion mu&s;t he have of me? And if he has, How can he Love me? But if he thinks well of me, Which way could he &s;uppo&s;e I would remain as much as one Moment in his Power? Alas! <HI>continu'd &s;he,</HI> all what has happen'd will be laid at my Door, and at that very time I endeavour to forget the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and even deny my &s;elf the Plea&s;ure of thinking of him, they will imagine, that I was willing to follow him to &s;ome &s;olitary Place. How Happy had I bin, <HI>added &s;he,</HI> had I not bin &s;av'd from the Danger I under-went this very Day! it would have &s;av'd me a World of di&s;grace during the whole Cour&s;e of my Mi&s;erable Life. Having &s;poken
<PB N="193" REF="200">
the&s;e Words, &s;he cry'd mo&s;t bitterly. <HI>Albine</HI> then taking the Liberty to interrupt her, 'Twould be unju&s;t, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> to charge you with a thing, you have no &s;hare in; No, Ma|dam, don't di&s;turb your &s;elf, your Innocence will confound your Enemies; and, if the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> be never &s;o much irritated again&s;t you, he can't but admire and publi&s;h your Vertue. Lovers in their Anger give an but in|different Character of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; be&s;ides, whatever he can &s;ay of me, will be look'd up|on as &s;u&s;picious: But <HI>Albine,</HI> What will the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> What will my Mother think of it? I am &s;ure, they will judge me guilty: Oh! fatal Day to my Repo&s;e! Oh! cur&s;ed Attempt! What is it I have committed, to draw this Misfortune upon me?</P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;he was in this Agony, the Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> came into the Room; the Confu&s;ion &s;he ob&s;erv'd in her at fir&s;t meeting near the River-&s;ide, had made her re&s;olve to go to the utmo&s;t extremity with her Daughter; but upon further Con&s;iderations, thought it be&s;t to &s;hut her &s;elf up for &s;ome time in her Chamber, to re&s;tore to her Mind that Tranquillity &s;he thought ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite in an Affair of this Nature. The young Counte&s;s perceiving her to be pretty Calm, her fear was chang'd into a rea&s;onable Confidence, &s;o ki&s;&s;ing her Mother's Hand &s;eve|ral times, &s;he gave her a &s;incere Account of the whole Tran&s;action; and notwith&s;tanding her Inclinations for the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> did not forget to tell her, that he was the Author of it; believ'd it was &s;ufficient to &s;peak the Truth, to per&s;wade her Mother that &s;he did &s;o; but the old Counte&s;s recalling to her Mind the Picture dropt out of the Earl's Pocket, with many other
<PB N="194" REF="201">
Circum&s;tances, which made her then &s;u&s;pect a Corre&s;pondence betwixt them, now thought &s;he was fully convinc'd, that her Daughter had the Misfortune of being in Love, and to be be|lov'd. Her au&s;tere Temper could not &s;uffer the fore|&s;ight of the Dangers &s;he &s;uppos'd her Daughter would be expos'd to, &s;o that in&s;tead of Condoling her, &s;he broke out into Reproaches: She told her, The Confe&s;&s;ion &s;he had made her, &s;eem'd to her an affect only of Con&s;traint, &s;ince &s;he had told her nothing but what mu&s;t be divulg'd a cour&s;e; But that &s;he could very ea|&s;ily &s;ee through that affected Air of Simpli|city and Ingenuity: That &s;he might re&s;t a&s;&s;ur'd &s;he would always &s;ide with my, Lord <HI>Devon|&s;hire,</HI> to keep her under, &s;eeing &s;he had bin &s;o unfortunate as to &s;uffer her &s;elf to be led away by &s;uch Sentiments as mu&s;t make her Blu&s;h. The young Counte&s;s remain'd &s;o highly afflicted at the Con&s;truction her Mother upon put her &s;in|cere Confe&s;&s;ion, that &s;he was not able to &s;peak one Word more in her own behalf. Her Si|lence &s;erving only to accompli&s;h her Mother's &s;u&s;picions again&s;t her, &s;he left her, convinc'd, as &s;he thought, that the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> had not made this Attempt without her Con&s;ent. Af|ter all this, tho' the Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> judg'd her Daughter guilty of this Error, &s;he was too Wi&s;e a Woman not to take all po&s;&s;ible Pre|cautions to conceal it from the Earl of <HI>Devon|&s;hire;</HI> &s;he was willing to reduce her Daughter within Bounds, without being acce&s;&s;ary to her Ruin.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> had &s;carce ever bin at <HI>Twittenham,</HI> the Illne&s;s of the Chevalier, his Friend&s;hip for him, and his In|differency for his Wife, kept him con&s;tantly in
<PB N="195" REF="202">
<HI>London:</HI> He attended con&s;tantly at Court, and had he not bin &s;en&s;ible, that the Counte&s;s was the mo&s;t Lovely Per&s;on in the World, he might perhaps have look'd out for another Engage|ment; but there are certain Charms, the Cha|racters whereof are indelible. Thus he might perhaps never have heard of the Attempt made upon his Wife, had not the Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> after his return to <HI>London,</HI> di&s;tracted with Spleen and Malice, re&s;olv'd to find out the Cure of his Pa&s;&s;ion, in his Continual Application of making his Fortune; For tho' the King had a peculiar regard to him, he might have bin much more in his Favour, had he taken the true Cour&s;e for it: But his Love-Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s, being to him in&s;tead of every thing, he took more Plea|&s;ure to employ his Thoughts upon her in his Clo&s;et, than to pur&s;ue his Advantage by attend|ing con&s;tantly at Court.</P>
<P>He now began to relent at the time he had lo&s;t, and the de&s;ire he had of being reveng'd of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who &s;tood betwixt him and the King's ab&s;olute Favour, made him enter into a &s;trict Friend&s;hip with <HI>Edward Woodwill</HI> Earl of <HI>Rivers,</HI> a Per&s;on more remarkable for his high De&s;erts, than for his being the Brother of the <HI>Fair Widow.</HI> For the re&s;t, his Fortune being not very con&s;ide|rable, and the Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> who was one of the Riche&s;t Lords in the Kingdom, making him a &s;harer in his whole Fortune, this Act of Gene|ro&s;ity &s;o far affected Madam <HI>Grey,</HI> that &s;he thought the Earl wanted nothing to make him Compleat in her Eyes, than to have an extream Aver&s;ion to the Earl of <HI>Warwick.</HI> The Earl al&s;o had given her to under&s;tand, that had he met with a le&s;s Rival in his Way, than the King, he &s;hould have made his Addre&s;&s;es to her; and, as
<PB N="196" REF="203">
&s;he was for nothing le&s;s than a Match, &s;he could have wi&s;h'd he had bin her Spou&s;e, he be|ing a Per&s;on well &s;hap'd, magnificent and engag|ing in Conver&s;ation; &s;o that every thing con|curr'd to &s;ettle a good Corre&s;pondence betwixt them.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> knew very well what &s;ub|ject of Complaint Madam <HI>Grey</HI> had again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and endeavour'd to hate him as much as &s;he did, having perhaps as pre&s;&s;ing Rea&s;ons for it as &s;he. Among other things he took delight to relate to her, as if it had bin a true Story, the Attempt that Earl had made for carrying Madam <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> away without her Con&s;ent; he would give her a De&s;cription of the Boat, with &s;ome other Circum&s;tances that at|tended this Enterprize, as he pretended, <HI>viz.</HI> How by Mi&s;chance &s;he fell into the River, which broke all their Mea&s;ures. Madam <HI>Grey</HI> was &s;ur|priz'd, to under&s;tand that &s;o unaccountable an Action, perform'd within Eight or Nine Miles of <HI>London,</HI> &s;hould have made not the lea&s;t Noi&s;e, and that the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> who was the Per&s;on mo&s;t concern'd therein, &s;hould be &s;o lit|tle acquainted with it as to continue at Court; &s;he was no le&s;s &s;urpriz'd at the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> He had in all Appearance made all his Appli|cations to his new Mi&s;tre&s;s, he had fix'd his Bu&s;ine&s;s and Plea&s;ures in the &s;ame Place, his whole Deportment and Air appear'd altogether compos'd. Is it po&s;&s;ible, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> a Man &s;hould be &s;o perfect a Ma&s;ter in the Art of Di&s;&s;imu|lation? Who could have &s;u&s;pected him, whil&s;t he Fea&s;ts all the Ladies at Court, and is &s;carce ever out of their Company, he &s;hould contrive how to carry away one. In &s;hort, it being agreed betwixt her and the Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> to di|vulge
<PB N="197" REF="204">
the thing, he gave her a full Account of all the Particulars relating to it. And who could better do it than him&s;elf? Nothing was omitted, as &s;he was a declar'd Enemy of the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s: She told the King of it, who &s;hew'd a greater Concern thereat, than &s;he de|&s;ired. Is it po&s;&s;ible, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that a Per&s;on of his Capacity and Extraction, &s;hould thus far bid Farewel to Rea&s;on, as to &s;eek thus his own De&s;truction for ever? If &s;he had once taken a Re&s;olution to allow her &s;elf full Liberty, Why did not &s;he pitch upon my Heart, before that of &s;o indi&s;creet and incon&s;tant a Man? The&s;e Words being not very plea&s;ing to the <HI>Fair Widow,</HI> &s;he Blu&s;h'd more than once; but thought it be&s;t to &s;ay nothing.</P>
<P>The King was &s;o full of this News, that the fir&s;t time he &s;aw the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> he &s;poke to him of it; and the Earl being much &s;urpriz'd, thereat, the King thought it had bin fain'd, to avoid to come to a &s;incere Confe&s;&s;ion, &s;o that there wanted but little of his being in a great Pa&s;&s;ion; and as the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> could not devi&s;e how &s;uch an Adventure, wherein he had not the lea&s;t &s;hare, &s;hould be laid to his Charge, he was &s;o taken up with his Thoughts thereupon, that not ob&s;erving the King was in Earne&s;t, he turn'd the whole Story into Ridicule, tho' at the &s;ame time he re&s;olv'd to find out the bottom of the De&s;ign. On the other Hand, Madam <HI>Grey</HI>'s Hatred to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> was &s;uch, as not to &s;uffer her to let &s;lip &s;o fair an Opportunity of revenging her Quarrel: She took effectual Care to make the Earl of <HI>Devon|&s;hire</HI> acquainted with what had happen'd at <HI>Twit|tenham,</HI> and as he was very apt to believe his own Misfortune, he communicated it to the <HI>Chevalier</HI>
<PB N="198" REF="205">
<HI>de Here&s;ord,</HI> who bore his full &s;hare in his Afflictions, whil&s;t the Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> kept the Key of the whole Secret in his own Hands: 'Twas he that had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing &s;o many Per|&s;ons concern'd in the Intere&s;t of my Lady <HI>De|von&s;hire,</HI> reduc'd almo&s;t to De&s;pair, and him&s;elf thus reveng'd for her Cruel Treatment. Tho' it is certain, he would &s;carce have carry'd the Mat|ter &s;o far, had it not bin to oblige Madam <HI>Grey;</HI> for whom he began already to have a mo&s;t &s;ingu|lar E&s;teem.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> once more felt the true Symptoms of Jealou&s;y: He thought him&s;elf cur'd of his Pa&s;&s;ion, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf with another not without &s;ome &s;atisfaction; but now found him&s;elf more afflicted, and more unfortunate than ever. For &s;uppo&s;ing no otherwi&s;e, than that he had bin &s;lighted by the Counte&s;s, becau&s;e &s;he was engag'd with another Lover, he had a Thou&s;and Chime|ra's in his Head upon that account, which con|tinually tormented him; What Projects of Ven|geance did he not contrive? Sometimes he was for advi&s;ing the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> how to deal with his Wife; &s;ometimes for finding out his Rival, to Stab him before the Counte&s;s's Face; and at la&s;t concluded, that this Attempt had in it &s;ome|thing &s;o bold and irregular, that he ought to reproach him&s;elf for retaining the lea&s;t E&s;teem, in regard of a Per&s;on who could expo&s;e her &s;elf to &s;uch an Adventure. The Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> ambitious to triumph over his Rival, went to give him a Vi&s;it; and the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> impa|tient to &s;ee and tell him of the Attempt made upon the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and how it was laid at his door, &s;carce would give him time to &s;hut the Door of the Clo&s;et. 'Tis true, <HI>&s;aid the Earl of</HI> Pembrook, you are charg'd with it, and
<PB N="199" REF="206">
truly it &s;eems not very extraordinary, if &s;uch a <HI>Paris</HI> as you, &s;hould Ravi&s;h &s;uch a <HI>Hellena</HI> as &s;he is. If even I lov'd her &s;till, I &s;hould be too much concern'd for her Reputation, to expo&s;e her thus; but as I don't Love her any more, it &s;eems Extravagant to lay a thing to my Charge, an Action of &s;o nice a Nature. What then can it be, <HI>added the Earl of</HI> Pembrook, that could rai&s;e this Su&s;picion, of the thing being tran&s;act|ed by your Orders? 'Tis that what I am ignorant of, and what I will endeavour to find out, <HI>&s;aid the Earl,</HI> and you mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t me in it, &s;ince I hope, that in confe&s;&s;ing your &s;elf a Friend to Madam <HI>Grey,</HI> to &s;uch a Degree as you do, you may ne|verthele&s;s continue in the &s;ame Tye of Friend|&s;hip with me as before. The Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> told him, that he would &s;ooner renounce her than his Friend&s;hip; that he mu&s;t own, that when he fir&s;t heard the Relation of what had happen'd at <HI>Twittenham,</HI> he had believ'd it as all the re&s;t did; but that, &s;ince he de&s;ir'd it, he would en|deavour to find it out: Thus they parted like the be&s;t Friends in the World.</P>

<P>IN the mean while the <HI>Chevalier de Here|ford</HI> being &s;ooner recovered of his Illne&s;s than of his Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s of <HI>De|von&s;hire</HI> and not able to re&s;i&s;t this De&s;pair oc|ca&s;ion'd by the news of the Attempt made upon the &s;aid Counte&s;s, thought of nothing more than how to &s;atisfie his own Revenge under the pretence of e&s;pou&s;ing the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>'s Quarrel.

The Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and the <HI>Chevalier de Hereford</HI> going together to <HI>Twhittenham</HI> upon their Approach to that Seat, where the Counte&s;s was, were &s;eized with &s;o fu|rious a Re&s;entment, that to calm their &s;pirits they thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top for &s;ome time in a little Wood: It being after Sun &s;et, and pretty cool, they alighted and &s;eated them&s;elves under the Trees, after a few minutes &s;ilence the Earl addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf thus to the Chevalier: <HI>I hope you will now no more oppo&s;e my ju&s;t re&s;ent|ment and vengeance, I hope I may now without inju&s;tice Cloi&s;ter up for ever this unfaithful Wo|man, and treat her in &s;uch a manner as the af|front &s;he has put upon me de&s;erves.

<HI>once made &s;o much noi&s;e we will not be over cau|tious, we will carry away in our turn, and we will be too nimble for her Friends.</HI> The Che|valier highly approved his Re&s;olution, and it was pretty late before they left off talking. The Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> u&s;ed almo&s;t every day to walk the &s;ame Wood there to condole her di&s;grace, and to give vent to her Grief; Dark|ne&s;s and Silence &s;eeming to afford her &s;ome Comfort in her pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances. Tho' her Mother had re&s;trained her within very nar|row bounds, &s;he had neverthele&s;s allow'd her the liberty of withdrawing at &s;ome di&s;tance from tho&s;e that attended her; and to tarry by her &s;elf as long as &s;he thought convenient. The &s;ame chance that had directed the Earl of <HI>De|von&s;hire</HI> and his Kin&s;man very near to the place where &s;he was &s;eated, would have it &s;o that they &s;hould not &s;ee her, and that &s;he at the &s;ame time &s;hould hear every thing they di&s;cour&s;ed to|gether, for tho' they talk'd not very loud, yet being &s;eparated from them only by a number of thick Hedges, or Shrubs, or &s;ingle Trees, they might have ea&s;ily &s;een her.

drawn upon her &s;o many misfortunes, and who was acquainted better than any other Man in the Court, with what &s;he had been capable of do|ing rather than fall into his hands, remain'd an idle Spectator on the inju&s;tices offered to her.</P>
<P>The&s;e various reflections crouding in upon her Spirits, &s;he was &s;o confounded, that at la&s;t &s;he re&s;olved to abide the thunderbolt that was &s;tri|king at her head, and to &s;uffer her &s;elf to be car|ry'd whither the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> &s;hould think convenient: <HI>What matters it,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>whether I die in a Tower or in a Den, whether I am made away by Dagger or Poy&s;on: Let me be carry'd where I will, let my Death or De&s;tiny what it will, my comfort will be in a good con&s;cience, I &s;hall be &s;atisfy'd I have nothing to upbraid my &s;elf with, and that I &s;uffer unde&s;ervedly the&s;e misfortunes that befall me: Is not all this &s;uffi|cient to depart this life without regret.</HI> But &s;oon after con&s;idering with her &s;elf that her Reputa|tion lay at &s;take unle&s;s &s;he could ju&s;tifie her &s;elf, and that &s;he ought not to neglect any means to maintain her Innocence, &s;he took a firm re&s;olu|tion &s;o to do, looking upon it as a thing altoge|ther worthy her care. <Q REND="inline">'No, &s;aid &s;he, I can't re&s;olve to put Arms into my Enemy's hands; If I make them Ma&s;ters of my De&s;tiny, I &s;hall never be in a condition to efface tho&s;e &s;u&s;pici|ons the world has conceived again&s;t me, is it not therefore much better to fly them, and to conceal my &s;elf in &s;ome place or other. Does not Heaven who thought fit I &s;hould over-hear the Di&s;cour&s;e betwixt my Husband and his Kin&s;man, &s;eem to ordain me to make the be&s;t u&s;e of it?

<P>She aro&s;e trembling all over, not daring to &s;tir from her place, but her Husband and his Kin&s;man being altogether taken up in Di&s;cour&s;e, and the Wind making &s;uch a noi&s;e among the Leaves, as not to permit them to hear what pa&s;s'd at a &s;mall di&s;tance from them.

A Lady of her quality &s;o young and &s;o hand&s;ome as &s;he to become a fugitive to fly like a Criminal to avoid the rage of her Husband, could not but imagine that &s;uch a re&s;olution would meet with a favourable con&s;truction in the World, but the dread of a Pri&s;on was &s;uch to her, that &s;he thought nothing too much to avoid it.</P>

<P>My Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> being accu&s;tomed to pa&s;s many hours together near a Brook, which run cro&s;s the Wood, 'twas very late before her family began to wonder at her &s;tay, &s;o that no|thing but the fear they conceived of her being &s;eized with a &s;udden illne&s;s made them go in &s;earch after her; they were not a little &s;urpri|zed when they met there with the Earl of <HI>De|von&s;hire</HI> and his Kin&s;man, who ask'd them whe|ther they had not &s;een their Hor&s;es, and com|manded them to look after them, whil&s;t &s;ome obeyed their orders, the re&s;t run through all the places of the Wood, whether the Counte&s;s u&s;ed to retire mo&s;t frequently, but in vain, &s;he was gone, as I told you ju&s;t now; and the Hor&s;e whom &s;he had left behind, finding him&s;elf with|out a Bridle was run away. The Earl of <HI>De|von&s;hire</HI> knew nothing of his Wife's having bin that Evening in the Wood, &s;o that when he was told that &s;he was not to be found, and that no body knew what was become of the Hor&s;es, he was &s;urprized to the highe&s;t degree, and it came immediately into his head, that the thing was not an effect of Chance, but of her own choice, and that &s;he was more concern'd in it than any body el&s;e. He di&s;covered his Sentiments to the Chevalier, who was not of his opinion, but &s;aid, She might perhaps be gone back alone to the Hou&s;e, that their be&s;t way was to go thither, &s;ince if they had a mind to pur&s;ue her, they had no Hor&s;es, &s;o that he judged they could do no better than to go thither to be better inform'd concerning the whole matter.</P>
<P>This being the fir&s;t time the Earl of <HI>Devon|&s;hire</HI> and the <HI>Chevalier</HI> came to <HI>Thwittenham</HI> after what had happened upon the River, every thing
<PB N="8" REF="214">
look'd but with an indifferent a&s;pect there, my Lady <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> dreading her Husband's Anger in behalf of her Daughter, &s;ent her one of her Women to advi&s;e her not to &s;tir out of her Chamber till &s;he had &s;ounded the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Earl. But the Per&s;on &s;he had &s;ent &s;oon re|turn'd, and whi&s;pered her in the Ear, that &s;he was not there, nor to be found any where, ha|ving bin in the &s;ame Wood at the &s;ame time the Earl was there.</P>
<P>This News proved the cau&s;e of fre&s;h inquie|tudes, and dreading all the &s;ini&s;ter Events for her Daughter &s;he could think of, &s;he changed colour &s;everal times, and what pains &s;he took to conceal the di&s;turbance of her mind, &s;erved only to di&s;cover it. The Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and the Chevalier <HI>de Hereford</HI> went not without their &s;hare in the&s;e troubles. The la&s;t ask'd how the Counte&s;s did, and whether &s;he might be &s;een without incommoding her? At the&s;e words, my Lady <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> no longer able to keep &s;ilence: <Q REND="inline">'Oh! my Lord, &s;aid &s;he to her Son in law, you know better than any body el&s;e what is become of your Wife, I am not ignorant that you met with her, becau&s;e &s;he comes not again, what dreadful things have you told her; you &s;ee &s;he is not come back you don't do ju&s;tice either to her Vertue or Merits.'</Q> The Earl turning coldly towards her, told her only in a few words, <Q REND="inline">'That had he met with the Counte&s;s they &s;hould have come home together; that he was very unea&s;ie at her ab&s;ence, and that he beg'd of her to let her be looked after, and that he might go away with the re&s;t.'</Q> So leaving the Room he gave orders to ha&s;ten to the Wood with lighted <HI>Flambeaux.</HI> This happened very well for the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> who whil&s;t they &s;pent their time in &s;earching for her in the
<PB N="9" REF="215">
Wood, had lei&s;ure given her to &s;ecure her &s;elf. After a long &s;earch, at la&s;t word was brought to the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> that certain fre&s;h prints of a Hor&s;e's Hoof being traced in the more un|frequented parts of the Wood, it was likely the Counte&s;s had taken that way in her flight. The Earl and the Chevalier approving their opinions, re&s;olved to follow her them&s;elves, being unwill|ing to entru&s;t any other.</P>
<P>The Tract they follow'd brought them to a &s;teep Hill, where &s;eeing no more &s;igns of a Hor&s;e's Hoof, and it being now day-break they alighted and &s;eated them&s;elves near a Rivulet, &s;oon after they e&s;pied the Chavalier <HI>de Hereford</HI>'s Hor&s;e running along full &s;peed without Saddle or Bridle, &s;o that the Chevalier who had not &s;haken off his pa&s;&s;ion for the fair Counte&s;s thought he &s;hould have dy'd for her. <Q REND="inline">''Tis no otherwi&s;e, my Lord, cry'd he, your Lady has laid violent hands upon her &s;elf on this Hill, I ju&s;t now have found out the whole my&s;tery of it, &s;he did over-hear our Di&s;cour&s;e in the Wood, and dreading your Revenge took the opportunity of &s;aving her &s;elf upon my Hor&s;e. Doubtle&s;s &s;he let him run where he would, for all her aim being to &s;ecure her &s;elf by flight &s;he did not care whither. Alas! he has carried her into this De&s;art, and thrown her out of the Saddle down one of the Precipices, you &s;ee not far from hence.'</Q></P>
<P>Tho' you might have read grief in his Face, the Earl was &s;o intent upon what he &s;aid, that he little minded it. All Circum&s;tances &s;eem to concur to per&s;wade me, what you &s;ay, to be true, reply'd he, but there are certain things that mu&s;t not be divulged without an ab&s;olute <Q REND="inline">'certainty, this is one of that kind; If I &s;hould tell them my Wife lo&s;t her Life in &s;uch a
<PB N="10" REF="216">
manner as you tell me, I know not but that the World may have malice enough to &s;u&s;pect me to be the Author of it. And if your Con|jectures &s;hould prove fal&s;e, if &s;he is alive and appears again, I &s;hall be ridiculed beyond what a man is able to bear; 'Tis therefore my ad|vice that after we have try'd all means to find her out, to retire to a certain old Seat I have in the mid&s;t of a Wood 'till we hear further how matters go.'</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Chevalier</HI> approving of this Propo&s;ition, they continued to &s;earch in all the adjacent pla|ces, but finding all their Endeavours to prove in vain, went to a Village beyond the Hills, when coming to a little Hou&s;e with tho&s;e that attend|ed them, they di&s;patch'd &s;ome to <HI>London</HI> and to &s;everal other places to go in que&s;t of the Coun|te&s;s.</P>
<P>This done the Earl and the Chevalier remoun|ted their Hor&s;es, and as they were going along &s;poke not &s;o much as one word to one another; their hearts being &s;o full that they did not know where to begin; The Earl feared (if you will believe him) that his Wife had kill'd her &s;elf; and the Chevalier dreaded it unto &s;uch a degree, he had all the rea&s;on in the world to be convin|ced that he was not cured of his Pa&s;&s;ion, as he had flattered him&s;elf he was. Jealou&s;y and Hatred had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Earls mind, Love and Fear were the predominant Pa&s;&s;ions in that of the Chevalier: <Q REND="inline">'Is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, you &s;hould lo&s;e the mo&s;t amiable per&s;on in the world, that you &s;hould know &s;he is dead, and &s;hould carry it off with &s;o much Tranquility? Who told you, reply'd the Earl, that I have lo&s;t her, and that I enjoy &s;o much Tranquillity? I am the main Per&s;on in this Scene, the part I am to act in it is &s;o melancholy that it is not to be done indiffer|ently:
<PB N="11" REF="217">
This is one of tho&s;e kind of Afflictions which ought to be clo&s;ed up within the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of our Heart, without expo&s;ing them to publick view.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'You might give me a &s;hare in your Misfortunes, &s;aid the Chevalier, our Friend&s;hip is &s;uch as not to allow of &s;uch a Re&s;erve, and I can't but be offended thereat. I know not what your Opinion is, reply'd the Earl coldly; but this I know, that you are di&s;po&s;ed to accu&s;e me unju&s;tly.'</Q> He little dream't that the Chevalier cou'd have given him &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons, why he was more nearly con|cern'd in the Matter than him&s;elf; but this had more con&s;ideration than to make him his Confi|dant in this Ca&s;e; his bu&s;ine&s;s being at this time to conceal from him, the true Condition of his Heart.</P>
<P>At la&s;t they came to the Earls Hou&s;e in the Wood; a Hou&s;e built in the mo&s;t unacce&s;&s;ible place of a Fore&s;t, &s;o that they wanted a Guide to conduct them thither; the Earl having been there but once before in all his life-time. The Situation and Appearance of this old Hou&s;e was &s;uch, that it &s;eem'd to be cho&s;en on purpo&s;e for a Seat and Nur&s;ery of Melancholy.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they &s;pent their time in this di&s;mal Place, the Earl of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> and his Lady were ready to run Di&s;tracted at <HI>Twittenham,</HI> at the uncertainty they lay under of what was become of their Daughter; and the more they loved her, the more ingenious were they to torment them|&s;elves. The Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> who&s;e Return they expected, not without good Rea&s;on, had taken another way with his Friend, whence they conjectured that his Con&s;cience accu&s;ed him of &s;ome ill action done by him to his Wife, and that therefore he would not abide the &s;ight of them. They cau&s;ed &s;earch to be made for her in

all Corners; and my Lady <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> finding her|&s;elf every where unea&s;ie, left the Country and went to <HI>London;</HI> but cou'd not leave her anxious Thoughts behind her.</P>
<P>'Twas next to an impo&s;&s;ibility, that an Acci|dent wherein &s;o many Per&s;ons of the fir&s;t Quality were concern'd, &s;hou'd not be known at Court. The King was &s;oon acquainted that the Counte&s;s cou'd not be found, and that her Husband lay under a &s;u&s;picion of having play'd her &s;ome ill Game: He compa&s;&s;ionated heartily the Misfor|tune of &s;o lovely a Per&s;on, and the Earl of <HI>War|wick</HI> happening to come into his Clo&s;et at that very moment, whil&s;t he was reflecting upon this odd Accident, he told him: My Lord, <HI>What have you not to an&s;wer for, on account of my La|dy</HI> Devon&s;hire? <HI>'tis believ'd &s;he is Dead, and that your extravagant Attempt to carry her away, has been the occa&s;ion of it.</HI> The Earl was &s;o &s;urpriz'd thereat, as not to be able to give an An&s;wer, for &s;ome time; all the Merits and Charms of the Counte&s;s appear'd again &s;o fre&s;h in their utmo&s;t lu&s;tre to his Mind; that the &s;ame Fires, which was thought to have extingui&s;h'd, was rekind|led at once. <HI>Don't imagine Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that the Change you ob&s;erve in my Face, or the Confu&s;ion you &s;ee me in, is owing to any thing I have to re|proach my&s;elf on account of what your Maje&s;ty told me; I never in my Life made the lea&s;t attempt of carrying away the Counte&s;s;</HI> nay, <HI>I re&s;ented to the very Heart, the weakne&s;s I found &s;he was guilty of upon this Occa&s;ion for another Per&s;on but my&s;elf; and I actually flattered my&s;elf, that this con&s;ideration cured me of my Pa&s;&s;ion for her;</HI> but, Sir, <HI>I am &s;en&s;ible of all the effects of her Charms by that direful Fear I am in, never to &s;ee her a|gain; 'tis this that puts me into the mo&s;t deplora|ble Condition in the World.</HI> His Eyes then were

covered with Tears, which the King ob&s;erving, told him, Warwick <HI>you cry!</HI> No Sir, reply'd the Earl, <HI>I am not guilty of &s;o much weakne&s;s.</HI> Oh, <HI>cry on! cry on!</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>'tis no Crime in a Lover that is cheri&s;h'd by his Mi&s;tre&s;s, to bewail her. I never had any occa&s;ion to con&s;ider her upon that Point,</HI> continued the Earl, <HI>for &s;he always &s;lighted, or at lea&s;t &s;hew'd an indifferency for me, which made me engage in another Amour, and thought I had almo&s;t razed her out of my Heart; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s to your Maje&s;ty, that the uncertain|ty of her De&s;tiny puts me into &s;uch a degree of De&s;pair, I am not able to overcome.

<P>As he was pa&s;&s;ing thro' the Privy Garden, next adjacent to the Court, he meets the Earl of <HI>Pembrock</HI> in a &s;hady dark Walk; and hoping to find &s;ome Con&s;olation in di&s;cour&s;ing his Friend upon this Subject matter; he acco&s;ted him with &s;o melancholy an Air; that the other immedi|ately perceived he had &s;omething of ill News to bring, that very near concern'd him. Alas! My Lord, &s;aid the Earl of <HI>Warwick, I &s;hall &s;ee her no more.

The Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> was not di&s;&s;atisfy'd thereat, &s;ince it &s;aved him the trouble of counterfeiting and re&s;training his true Thoughts before him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was got out of fight, he lay down under a Tree to indulge his melancholy Thoughts. 'Tis true, he had
<PB N="15" REF="221">
&s;ufficient cau&s;e of Affliction, &s;ince it was his too violent, and indi&s;creet Pa&s;&s;ion that had proved the Cau&s;e of the lo&s;s of the Repo&s;e, if not the Life of the Counte&s;s. He fetch'd very deep &s;ighs, and &s;hutting his Eyes, remain'd immove|able like one &s;truck with Death. His new Friend|&s;hip with Madam <HI>Gray,</HI> received &s;uch a check by the remembrance of the high De&s;erts of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> by the high e&s;teem he had of her Per&s;on, and by that Compa&s;&s;ion he felt within him&s;elf, for her Misfortunes, that he wi&s;h'd a thou&s;and times that the Period of his Life was at hand, to ju&s;tifie by a &s;olemn and &s;incere declaration, the Innocence of the op|pre&s;t Lady: <HI>Yes</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>I will publi&s;h to the World the Extravagancies I have comitted, I will expo&s;e my&s;elf to the fury of her Husband, to the King's Indignation, to the Violence of his Mi&s;tre&s;s and the Revenge of the Earl of</HI> Warwick: <HI>I wou'd be hated by all the World, lo&s;e all my Friends and Fortune, and after all this, I own my&s;elf not &s;uf|ficently puni&s;h'd.</HI></P>
<P>He was tormenting him&s;elf in this manner, heaping Reproaches upon Reproaches, when he found him&s;elf interrupted by Madam <HI>Gray.</HI> The King had told her with what trouble the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> had receiv'd the News of the lo&s;s of my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> which &s;he embraced with an exce&s;s of Joy, that &s;he was &s;carce able to con|tain her &s;elf.

Am I the occa&s;ion of it?</HI> re|ply'd &s;he, with &s;ome Impatience; <HI>but I will par|don you in &s;pite of your&s;elf; I look upon you as one that having lo&s;t his Sen&s;es, is not Ma&s;ter of his own Affections: go fetch them where you left them, and return in &s;uch a Condition as may en|gage me to pardon what is pa&s;t.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Pem|brook</HI> took his leave without an&s;wering one
<PB N="19" REF="225">
word, not being able to forgive her what &s;he had made him do again&s;t the poor Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon|&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner gone, but Madam <HI>Gray</HI> be|gan to be &s;en&s;ible (at lea&s;t more than ever &s;he had been before) that the Earl was not indifferent to her; &s;he was afraid that in&s;tead of &s;haking off his Spleen in the Country, he might rather con|tract &s;uch a Habit as might endanger his Health. <HI>He is going</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) <HI>to &s;ome place or other, re|mote from all the World, to bury him&s;elf in his Thoughts of the Counte&s;s of</HI> Devon&s;hire; <HI>'twill be a hard matter to get her out of his Head; and &s;o he will fall into &s;ome Di&s;temper, nay, for what I know it may co&s;t him his Life; alas! perhaps he may die.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Reflexions cau&s;ed no &s;mall Symptoms of Pain and Grief in her, being &s;urprized to feel within her&s;elf &s;uch tender Inclinations for the Earl; and &s;he wou'd have reproach'd her&s;elf up|on that Head, had not the con&s;ideration of ma|king her Fortunes over ballanc'd the re&s;t, for the Widow of a private Gentleman, to be married to a Per&s;on of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> high a Rank in the King|dom.</P>
<P>Di&s;turbed with the&s;e Reflexions, &s;he &s;ends for her Brother, the Earl <HI>Rivers,</HI> one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Lords at Court, and in great favour with the King: As he began to be con&s;idered al|ready, as one of the King's growing Favourites, who had be&s;tow'd great Favours upon him, this occa&s;ioned &s;uch a jealou&s;ie in the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> that they were upon the point once of deciding their Quarrel by a Duel, had they not been preven|ted by the King's Authority; who, to &s;top their Rage, had pre&s;cribed them certain Rules, which neither of them was to Tran&s;gre&s;s, on pain of his Di&s;plea&s;ure; notwith&s;tanding which, there
<PB N="20" REF="226">
remain'd a certain Grudge betwixt them; which being carefully maintain'd by Madam <HI>Gray,</HI> they were become irreconcilable Enemies: 'Twas upon this con&s;ideration, &s;he judged, &s;he could not put the Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> into &s;urer hands than his, to make him avoid all manner of Cor|re&s;pondence with the Earl of <HI>Warwick.</HI></P>
<P>So &s;oon as he was come into her Chamber, &s;he told him &s;he intended to give him an oppor|tunity of putting an Obligation upon her: <HI>That the Earl of</HI> Pembrook <HI>being &s;eized with a very deep Melancholy, was a going to retire to &s;ome &s;olitary place; where in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, he wou'd encrea&s;e his Spleen; that &s;he being his Friend, de&s;ired him to carry the Earl to his fine Seat call'd</HI> Grafton, <HI>and to &s;tay with him there for &s;ome time. You will perhaps tell me,</HI> continu'd &s;he, <HI>you can't be ab&s;ent from Court without great Prejudice to your&s;elf, &s;ince in &s;o doing you will leave the Earl of</HI> Warwick, <HI>as it were, ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of the Field of Battel; but rely upon my Words, Brother, I will talk of you &s;o frequently to the King, that upon your return out of the Coun|try, you &s;hall find your Affairs in a better conditi- than when you left them.</HI></P>
<P>There needed no more to engage the Earl <HI>Rivers</HI> to act as Madam <HI>Gray</HI> had de&s;ired. He told her, this opportunity of obliging her he look'd upon as too precious not to embrace it; that he wou'd go immediately to the Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> and certainly per&s;uade him rather to chu&s;e <HI>Grafton Hou&s;e,</HI> than any other, for his Place of Retirement.</P>
<P>Accordingly he went to him, when he was ju&s;t upon his Departure: They being very inti|mate Friends, and the Earl <HI>Rivers</HI> pretending he knew nothing of his intended Journey, told him he came to take his leave of him, becau&s;e he
<PB N="21" REF="227">
intended to go the next day to <HI>Grafton</HI> Hou&s;e. Are you engaged, reply'd the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> in &s;ome Hor&s;e-match or other, to be run there? No, &s;aid he, I go only to re&s;t my &s;elf of the fa|tigues of the Court: If you have &s;o much friend|&s;hip as to go along with me thither, I will think my &s;elf obliged to you as long as I live. I am a going, reply'd the Earl, with a melancholy Air, a great way further off, I have &s;ome pre&s;&s;ing rea&s;ons which make me fly that which would prove a great di&s;&s;atisfaction to me. The Earl <HI>Rivers</HI> appearing as if he were &s;urprized at his Re&s;olution, urged the matter &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully to him, that he agreed to go along with him; &s;o they went out of <HI>London</HI> the next day.</P>
<P>They needed not have taken &s;o much precau|tion, there being but little probability of the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s meeting with the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> for each of them had Clo&s;tred them|&s;elves up to lament the Death, or at lea&s;t the lo&s;s of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI> She, as I told you before, was gone to Madam <HI>Digby</HI>'s, where &s;he was entertain'd with all imaginable Civility. 'Tis true, under the Di&s;gui&s;e &s;he had taken, &s;he pa&s;s'd there but for a per&s;on of an in|different condition; but notwith&s;tanding this, her Air and Deportment gain'd her much re&s;pect from all that beheld her. She had a&s;&s;umed the name of <HI>Jamy,</HI> the better to conceal her Sex, and Madam <HI>Digby</HI> had two Sons, and a very hand&s;ome Niece, a Woman of a great deal of &s;en&s;e, &s;weet in Conver&s;ation, very &s;erious, and &s;omething ad|dicted to Melancholy. Her name was <HI>Leonore,</HI> and Madam <HI>Digby</HI> being re&s;olved to make a match betwixt her and her Elde&s;t Son, who was a &s;hort, ill favour'd and ill-temper'd Piece, u&s;ed to keep <HI>Leonore</HI> from all Conver&s;ation, for fear le&s;t <HI>Leonore,</HI> in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould &s;ee others
<PB N="22" REF="228">
more amiable than her Son, &s;he might take an aver&s;ion both to his Per&s;on and the intended Match. <HI>Leonore</HI> thus &s;pent the be&s;t of her days within the walls of her Aunts Hou&s;e, when my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> came thither, who in this Di&s;|gui&s;e appear'd &s;o Graceful as if it had bin natu|ral to her, &s;o that <HI>Leonore</HI> from the fir&s;t mo|ment &s;he &s;aw her was captivated to &s;uch a de|gree, that her eyes, who were not acquainted with any thing el&s;e but the &s;ight of her ugly Cou&s;ins, were now continually employ'd upon <HI>Jamy;</HI> and &s;he being a Woman of great Vivacity of Wit, her Conver&s;ation with <HI>Jamy</HI> was &s;o plea|&s;ant, as by degrees in&s;pired her with that tender|ne&s;s &s;he did neither fore&s;ee, nor was able to over|come.</P>
<P>For, be&s;ides that they were both of the &s;ame Sex, the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> had &s;uch weigh|ty rea&s;ons to have an abhorrence for Love, that even the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Diver&s;ions, that had the lea&s;t relation to that Pa&s;&s;ion, could not be ac|ceptable to her. She was quite overwhelm'd with her misfortunes, under the greate&s;t uncer|tainty how to manage her &s;elf for the future, exa&s;perated again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> irre|concilable to her Spou&s;e and the <HI>Chevalier de Hereford,</HI> very unea&s;ie on account of the &s;u&s;pi|cions her Family might conceive again&s;t her, and the Reports that were likely to be &s;pread abroad upon her account: All the&s;e were matters of &s;uch con&s;equence, as to employ all her thoughts, which would make her &s;pend &s;ome times a whole night in one of the mo&s;t &s;olitary places of the Park belonging to the Hou&s;e. The only thing &s;he took &s;ome delight in to divert her Me|lancholy, was to be in&s;tructed in the Exerci&s;e of Arms, wherein &s;he improved &s;o well, that &s;he would match the be&s;t Man in &s;hooting, and
<PB N="23" REF="229">
Madam <HI>Digby</HI> keeping a Fencing Ma&s;ter in the Hou&s;e to teach her two Sons, <HI>Jamy</HI> by his In|&s;tructions in a little time became as formidable for his Arm as for his Eyes.</P>
<P><HI>Leonore</HI> was &s;urprized at the progre&s;s <HI>Jamy</HI> had made in this &s;ort of Exerci&s;e, and whereas be|fore &s;he was never known to have taken any no|tice of her Cou&s;in, when he was at this Exer|ci&s;e (becau&s;e he made &s;o mi&s;erable a figure) now &s;ince the arrival of <HI>Jamy,</HI> &s;he took &s;o much de|light in being there, that young <HI>Digby</HI> could not but take &s;ome notice of it. 'Tis true he did not know unto what to attribute this Alteration, but after having &s;eriou&s;ly reflected upon the mat|ter, apply'd the rea&s;on thereof to his own ad|vantage: Flu&s;h'd with the&s;e hopes, he de&s;ires <HI>Jamy</HI> to compo&s;e a Song or two in prai&s;e of his fair Cou&s;in, but <HI>James</HI> excu&s;ing him&s;elf with &s;ome carele&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Digby</HI> was &s;o vex'd there|at, that he got <HI>Jamy</HI> by the Throat. <HI>Leonore</HI> hearing the noi&s;e, came in to &s;ee what was the matter, and without he&s;itating upon the point, pulls her Cou&s;in by the Hair, till he was glad to let <HI>Jamy</HI> alone. Ingrateful Woman, cry'd the little Cou&s;in, did you know the occa&s;ion of our Quarrel, you would be as much vex'd at it as I am; I de&s;ir'd him to compo&s;e me &s;ome Ver&s;es I intended to pre&s;ent you with, but he told me with a &s;cornful look he could not make Ver&s;es at command, unle&s;s it were for him&s;elf. <HI>Leonore</HI> ca&s;ting a &s;cornful look upon her Coun&s;in, went a|way without &s;aying one word, to the Park, in that &s;olitary place to bewail her misfortune.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that &s;ince the arrival of <HI>Jamy,</HI> &s;he had had but little Repo&s;e. At the fir&s;t be|ginning &s;he imbraced this growing tenderne&s;s on|ly as a means to counterpoi&s;e her aver&s;ion to that Mon&s;ter, they had de&s;ign'd her for a Husband;
<PB N="24" REF="230">
but it was not long before &s;he was convinced to her co&s;t, that Love is no le&s;s pernicious than hatred; &s;he then began to open her eyes, and duly reflecting upon her pre&s;ent Circum|&s;tances, found Love &s;o dreadful a Gue&s;t, as made her &s;igh and condole her &s;elf without inter|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>She was no &s;ooner got to the further end of a thick and dark Wood, but &s;eating her &s;elf near a little Brook, &s;he ruminated a con&s;iderable time upon her pre&s;ent condition; at la&s;t, What do&s;t thou mean, unfortunate <HI>Leonore?</HI> &s;aid &s;he to her &s;elf; is it po&s;&s;ible thou &s;hould'&s;t be &s;o far an Enemy to thy &s;elf, as to have a particular re|gard to a young man &s;o much below thee? what is it thou propo&s;e&s;t, &s;ince he can't be thy Hus|band? But why? continued &s;he, I have Riches enough, and not Ambition, there is no place up|on Earth, where I could not live happily with him; and no doubt but he will think it the great|e&s;t good fortune that could befall him, to marry me. She framed a thou&s;and other plea&s;ing Pro|jects, which vani&s;hing as &s;oon as they came, and &s;he thus remaining in &s;u&s;pence betwixt hope and fear, &s;erved only to augment her affliction, when &s;he heard on a &s;udden a noi&s;e near her. For fear of being over heard by her Aunt, or young <HI>Digby,</HI> &s;he aro&s;e immediately, and ca&s;ting her Eyes on all &s;ides, found it was <HI>Jamy,</HI> who was going at a further di&s;tance as &s;oon as he &s;aw her.</P>
<P>She thought it was out of Re&s;pect; but be|ing no more Mi&s;tre&s;s of her own heart, &s;he call'd and made a &s;ign to him, to draw nearer. <HI>'Tis but rea&s;onable,</HI> &s;aid &s;he &s;milingly, <HI>I &s;hould chide you, for having refu&s;ed to oblige my Cou&s;in with a few Ver&s;es intended for me. I &s;hould have made but a very ill piece of work of it,</HI> reply'd he, <HI>my thoughts are too much taken up, to be employ'd in a</HI>

<HI>thing of this nature. Say rather,</HI> added &s;he, <HI>you are &s;o deeply engaged in a &s;ecret pa&s;&s;ion, as not to permit you to think of any other Object but what you love.</HI> He did not return an An&s;wer im|mediately, and the impatient <HI>Leonore</HI> continued her Di&s;cour&s;e; <HI>Your &s;ilence,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>is ea&s;ie to be under&s;tood: Oh!</HI> Jamy <HI>you are in Love, I &s;up|po&s;e it is with the &s;ame per&s;on for which you fought a Duel in</HI> London, <HI>'tis &s;he that has given us the opportunity of &s;eeing you here; what a Fatality is this!

The very name of</HI> Love <HI>is terrible to me. How is it po&s;&s;ible,</HI> reply'd &s;he, <HI>you &s;hould hate to &s;o exce&s;&s;ive a degree, what you don't know?

He told the Marque&s;s he dur&s;t &s;carce promi&s;e to him&s;elf &s;o much happine&s;s, neverthele&s;s he began to be much better compo&s;ed in his mind: 'Twas this that made him detain the Marque&s;s, (who in|tended to return immediately to <HI>London.</HI>) <HI>Stay, &s;tay here,</HI> &s;aid he to him, <HI>let us act in concert to deceive me, per&s;wade me that the Counte&s;s is yet alive. But alas!</HI> cry'd he, <HI>did ever I really be|lieve her to be dead, and was able to out-live her? I mu&s;t own to you, Brother, &s;he has had &s;omething of a fore&s;ight of what you now confirm to me.</HI> The Marque&s;s neglecting nothing which
<PB N="52" REF="258">
he judged might &s;trengthen him in this opinion, they pa&s;s'd that Evening in a very agreeable Con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The next, and &s;everal &s;ucceeding Days, the Marque&s;s &s;tay'd with the Earl; they &s;pent much of their time in Hunting, Fi&s;hing and Walking&punc; At la&s;t, the Earl de&s;irous to be &s;ometimes alone, to ruminate with the more freedom upon the Ad+venture of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> one day as they were walking near the <HI>Thames</HI> &s;ide, told the Marque&s;s, <HI>Dear Brother, I conjure you to permit me to take a Walk without you, walk you one way, I will chu&s;e another, and let us meet a|gain at</HI> Sion-hill. <HI>Why my Lord,</HI> &s;aid the Mar|que&s;s &s;miling, <HI>is my Conver&s;ation &s;o tire&s;om, that you can no longer bear with it? Alas,</HI> cry'd the Earl, <HI>I am not able to bear my &s;elf.</HI> The Marque&s;s heartily compa&s;&s;ionating his condition, left him alone without &s;aying one word.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> then turning into a Walk upon the very brink of the River, &s;eated him&s;elf under a Tree, where he could not be ea|&s;ily di&s;covered. Here he was pondring with him|&s;elf, whether he had be&s;t go to <HI>London</HI> in &s;earch of the Counte&s;s, or to write to the Earl of <HI>Pem|broke,</HI> to be inform'd concerning what had hap|pened at Madam <HI>Digby</HI>'s; but he was &s;oon check'd in this re&s;olution, when he reflected, that the Earl had kept it as a Secret from him. I told you before, that they had &s;een one another, &s;ince his return from <HI>Grafton-hou&s;e,</HI> when he was &s;o far from mentioning any thing of the matter, that on the contrary he a&s;&s;ured the Earl of <HI>War|wick,</HI> that my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> was actually dead: This made him begin to con&s;ider the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> as a Creature of Madam <HI>Gray,</HI> and knowing that he had been in the Country with the Earl <HI>Rivers,</HI> this Lady's Brother, and his
<PB N="53" REF="259">
Enemy, the&s;e Reflections could not but create in him a jealou&s;y again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Pembroke.</HI> He re&s;olved at la&s;t to &s;end <HI>Berincour</HI> to Madam <HI>Digby</HI>'s, to inform him&s;elf of all &s;he knew of that Affair, but feared that if my Lady <HI>Devon|&s;hire</HI> was really concerned in this Adventure, this Curio&s;ity of his might turn to her di&s;ad|vantage.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was remaining under this uncertain|ty, he happened to &s;ee at &s;ome di&s;tance upon the River a &s;mall Boat, and in it a &s;ingle Gentleman with a Bonnet pull'd over his face, row'd only by one Water man. He &s;aw them Land near that very place which he had cho&s;en for his Retire|ment. He heard the Gentleman &s;ay to the Wa|terman, Go to <HI>Sion-hill,</HI> and enquire whether the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> will not admit of a Vi&s;it, whether there is no means of delivering a Letter to him, and which way he takes his walks when he goes abroad. Don't forget any thing I tell you, I will &s;tay for your coming back here.</P>
<P>The Earl being &s;o near as to under&s;tand every word the Stranger &s;poke, had the Curio&s;ity, as &s;oon as the Water-man was at &s;ome di&s;tance from them, to know, who it was that wanted him; &s;o ari&s;ing from his place, <HI>I belong,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to the</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick, if you think fit to intru&s;t me with a Letter for him, I will infallibly bring you an An&s;wer. I know you too well,</HI> reply'd the Gen|tleman, &s;urprized to meet him in this place, <HI>to mi&s;take your Per&s;on; I am come here to have your Life, or to lo&s;e mine.</HI> And then drawing his Sword, advanced to the Earl, <HI>No Quarter, No Quarter,</HI> cry'd he, <HI>defend your &s;elf, or I will kill you.</HI> 'Tis ea&s;ie to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that my Lord <HI>Warwick,</HI> who was one of the brave&s;t Men upon Earth, would not have have &s;uffered him&s;elf to be thus urged by this unknown Per&s;on, had he
<PB N="54" REF="260">
not &s;oon known his voice: not doubting there|fore but that &s;he was the Counte&s;s, and that what the Marque&s;s of <HI>Montague</HI> had told him was really true, he was overjoy'd to &s;ee him&s;elf a&s;&s;ured by the per&s;on her &s;elf of her Life; but on the other hand being vex'd to the heart to find her &s;o far enraged at him, as that no le&s;s than his blood would &s;atisfie her, he remain'd immoveable like a Statue. At la&s;t he re&s;olved, in|&s;tead of retreating, to meet her: <HI>You de&s;ire my Life, Divine Counte&s;s,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;trike the &s;troke, this is perhaps the only minute I have been able to oblige you;</HI> and &s;o was ru&s;hing upon her Sword (for it was actually &s;he.) But how &s;oon is a per&s;on prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a mo&s;t tender e&s;teem di&s;arm'd by &s;o entire a Submi&s;&s;ion as this! The fair Lady was &s;o &s;urprized to be di&s;covered, and &s;o uncertain what to do, that &s;he was &s;carce able to hold her Sword, and had it not been for a Tree that &s;upported her, &s;he had drop'd down upon the Ground, being &s;eized with a mo&s;t vio|lent trembling. She &s;aw the Earl at her Feet, embracing her Knees, bathing his hands in his Tears, and his voice intercepted by a thou&s;and &s;ighs, could &s;carce expre&s;s the Sentiments of his heart. <HI>Ri&s;e, ri&s;e, my Lord,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>I can't &s;uf|fer to &s;ee you at my Feet. Oh! Madam,</HI> reply'd he, <HI>Either give me leave to die, or re&s;tore me to your favours. 'Tis &s;o long a time,</HI> return'd &s;he, <HI>you have laboured to ferfeit them, that I know not by what misfortune it is, I &s;hould not hate you more than I do. Have I laboured,</HI> &s;aid the Earl, <HI>to remove my &s;elf from your heart, alas! what way mu&s;t a man take then to come nearer to it? Have not I &s;erved you with the &s;ame Veneration as they do the Gods? No, no, my Lord,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>you have made all the ill u&s;e you could of a Letter I &s;ent you by</HI> Berincour. <HI>How!</HI> cry'd he, <HI>Do you</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="261">
<HI>mean tho&s;e two cruel lines you &s;ent to me during my Exilement, which alone afflicted me more than all my Di&s;graces together?</HI></P>
<P>'Twas now that they began to unfold their mi&s;take to one another; and the Attempt of car|rying off the Counte&s;s in the Bark, whereof &s;he accu&s;ed the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and whereof he ju&s;tify'd him&s;elf to her &s;atisfaction, occa&s;ioned no &s;mall &s;urprize in them. At la&s;t &s;he fairly told him, &s;he believed the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> or el&s;e the <HI>Chevalier de Hereford,</HI> were the Per&s;ons that did it, becau&s;e they had both made their Decla|rations of Love to her. The Earl now began to be &s;en&s;ible he had been bubbled by the very Per&s;on whom he thought his mo&s;t intimate; and now recalling to his mind a thou&s;and pa&s;&s;ages that happened betwixt them, all this &s;erved to confirm him in his &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P><HI>But Madam,</HI> &s;aid he to the Counte&s;s of <HI>De|von&s;hire, what is it that could move you to come to kill me? What is it I have been guilty of?

But don't you remember that it was every body's opinion that it was you that made this Attempt, and that it was done with my con|&s;ent? How did I know, as the ca&s;e &s;tood, whether it was the effect of an exce&s;&s;ive Pa&s;&s;ion, whereof we are not Ma&s;ters at all times; or rather of your malice to ruin my Reputation as well in my Fami|ly as in the World? 'Twas this opinion that made me re&s;olve to purcha&s;e my Ju&s;tification at the expence of your Life; I fancied it would prove the true&s;t reparation of my Honour, when the</HI>

Oh! Madam, did you not know your &s;elf to be at all times the Mi&s;tre&s;s of my Life?</HI> reply'd the Earl, <HI>what occa&s;ion was there for a Sword or other Arms to take away my Life? If you are &s;till of opinion that it may conduce to your Glory, never &s;pare an unfortunate Per&s;on whom you have made &s;uffer &s;o much.

At lea&s;t don't in&s;ult for the future over my fraity; If I mu&s;t &s;peak it to my &s;hame, I can a&s;&s;ure you, it will afford you no matter of Triumph. What is it I have committed,</HI> added he, <HI>you &s;hould deal &s;o rigorou&s;ly with me? Are you afraid, I &s;hould he apt to flatter my &s;elf too much? I don't very well know what I fear,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>but it &s;eems as if I ought to have a &s;ecret mi&s;tru&s;t of my &s;elf in re|gard to you.</HI></P>
<P>The Earl not able to contain him&s;elf for Joy, was going to throw him&s;elf at the fair Coun|te&s;s's Feet, when the Waterman returning from <HI>Sion-hill,</HI> gave an account of his &s;ucce&s;s in his Errand. She bid him go and &s;tay for her coming at &s;ome di&s;tance thence, <HI>What will you re&s;olve to do, Madam?</HI> &s;aid the Earl to her, <HI>can you ima|gine I &s;hould &s;uffer you to expo&s;e your &s;elf alone</HI>

<P>The Counte&s;s, after &s;ome further Reflections, being fully convinced of the danger laid before her eyes by the Earl, at la&s;t gave way to his rea|&s;ons, but would not let him go to <HI>London,</HI> the Night being come in&s;en&s;ibly upon them, be&s;ides that they had a great many things to &s;ay to one another, before they could well break off their Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The Waterman being &s;ent away, the fair Coun|te&s;s in her Man's Apparel went along with the Earl towards <HI>Sion-hill.</HI> This being the fir&s;t

How happy did he think him&s;elf! what &s;atisfaction did he not feel within his Brea&s;t! He feared not long ago that he was hated, he dreaded the Death of the Coun|te&s;s, but now all his Inquietudes were di&s;&s;ipated at once, he had &s;ight of his Counte&s;s again, and found her not di&s;&s;atisfied at her not having kill'd him.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s of <HI>Mountague</HI> in the mean while was not a little di&s;turbed at this long &s;tay of his Brother, and knowing both his De&s;pair, and the multitude of his Enemies, feared &s;ome ill accident might have befaln him. The King's Favour had procured him abundance of them, but e&s;pecially the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> his Family and Friends, bore him a moral hatred, looking upon him as the cau&s;e of their Misfortunes. The <HI>Chevalier de Hereford,</HI> who&s;e unhappy Pa&s;&s;i|on for the Counte&s;s encrea&s;ed every day, con&s;i|dered the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> as his mo&s;t cruel Enemy, and Madam <HI>Gray</HI>'s Creatures &s;hew'd no le&s;s Animo&s;ity again&s;t him; &s;o that the Mar|que&s;s of <HI>Mountague,</HI> no longer able to be at quiet under &s;uch a terrible incertitude, went out and &s;earch'd all tho&s;e &s;olitary Places whither the Earl u&s;ed to retire to utter his Complaints and Sighs. Making the be&s;t of his way he could towards the &s;ame Walk whither he had &s;een him go before he left him that, day he e&s;py'd him walking along in Company of a Gen|tleman, who &s;eeming &s;urprized at the &s;ight of him, was going to turn another way, till the Earl told him: <Q REND="inline">'Fear nothing, I will be an&s;wer|able for my Brother, and you are I hope &s;atis|fy'd,

The oftner he look'd at him, the more he was confirm'd in his Su&s;picion that it was the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon|&s;hire,</HI> who came to &s;helter her &s;elf at the Earl's Hou&s;e. Many other Circum&s;tances, &s;uch as her Voice, the &s;weetne&s;s of her Eyes, her mode&s;t De|portment, and in &s;hort her graceful Air, were all &s;uch things as he thought cou'd not be centred in any other Per&s;on but her &s;elf.</P>
<P>The Earl, the Marque&s;s and the Lady &s;upp'd together, or to &s;peak more truly, &s;at down at Table, for they eat nothing; the Earl being quite tran&s;ported with Joy, and the Marque&s;s &s;trucken with Admiration, and taken up wholly in viewing the Counte&s;s. As for her part, tho' &s;he was well enough pleas'd with the Earl's Ju|&s;tification, and her having found him again, &s;he was not without certain Reflections; which di|&s;turbing her Mind, you might have read her Me|lancholy in her Face. The Earl, who narrowly ob&s;erv'd her, &s;oon gue&s;&s;ing in &s;ome mea&s;ure at her thoughts, as &s;oon as he had an Opportu|nity of &s;peaking to her alone, conjur'd her to be at ea&s;e. <HI>What is it you fear,</HI> Madam? &s;aid he, <HI>my Life, my Fortune, and all my Intere&s;ts are</HI>

upon a Bed, with his Brother the Mar|que&s;s of <HI>Montague,</HI> they &s;pent the remainder of the Night in talking of the Counte&s;s.

<P>In the mean while the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and the <HI>Chevalier de Hereford</HI> were come back to <HI>London,</HI> to pur&s;ue the intended Di&s;covery; for having now &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to believe that the Counte&s;s was alive, they were re&s;olv'd to find her out at any rate; for which rea&s;on they &s;par'd neither Labour nor Co&s;t, and had their Spies in every Corner It had been ob&s;erv'd that the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> attended the King every Night till his going to Bed, and then went to <HI>Sion-hill;</HI> they knew al&s;o that the Marque&s;s of <HI>Montague</HI> continu'd here; and that the Earl had hired a Fa|mous <HI>Italian</HI> Picture drawer at an exce&s;&s;ive rate, becau&s;e he &s;hou'd work for no-body but for him.

<P>They went both together to pay their Re&s;pects to her, and found her very melancholy, on ac|count of the in&s;urmountable Difficulties &s;he met with every day, which hinder'd her Departure; and the Earl did not neglect any opportunity of re|pre&s;enting them more dangerous than they really were; and afterwards, to flatter her with hopes, &s;ometimes of the King's Protection, &s;ometimes of a Reconciliation betwixt her and the Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey</HI> her Mother.

<P>Whil&s;t they were thus riding along the Bank of the River, they &s;aw a Boat drawing near the Shoar; they knew immediately the Counte&s;s and <HI>Berincour,</HI> and tho' they cou'd &s;carce believe their Eyes, they leap'd with their Hor&s;es into the Water, without con&s;idering, that by the la&s;t Nights Rains, the River was much &s;woll'n. The Earl's Hor&s;e &s;oon getting beyond his depth, was carry'd away by the violence of the Current, which put him in the utmo&s;t danger of being drown'd. 'Twas at this very moment the Coun|te&s;s was convinc'd within her&s;elf how much more beloved he was by her, than ever &s;he had imagi|ned before; &s;he &s;et forth mo&s;t lamentable cries, which the Earl had the &s;atisfaction to hear; and when &s;oon after &s;he lo&s;t &s;ight of him, and actual|ly believed him to be lo&s;t, &s;he drop'd down half dead in the Boat, without the lea&s;t &s;igns of Sen&s;e or Motion. <HI>Bernicour</HI> not being in a condition to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, becau&s;e he and the Water-man they had taken along with them, row'd with all their &s;trength to &s;ave the Earl's Life; which they did mo&s;t fortunately: For the Earl finding his Hor&s;e to fall him, di&s;entangled his Feet out of the Stirrops, and lighting upon a Barge lately &s;unk there, he lays hold of the Ma&s;t which &s;tood above the Water, till <HI>Bernicour</HI> came to his Aid and took him into the Boat.</P>

Scale had turn'd; but was &s;en&s;ible it mu&s;t needs fall very hard upon the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> for whom he &s;till re|tain'd &s;ome favourable Inclinations, notwith&s;tand|ing his former Grudge, to &s;ee him&s;elf &s;o indif|ferently treated by her.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> dur&s;t not venture to go to Court, but writ a Letter, full of Re&s;pect and Submi&s;&s;ion, to the King, begging his Protection again&s;t the Widow and Relations of the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire:</HI> He repre&s;ented, that the Affront given him at the Play Hou&s;e, was of &s;uch a na|ture, as not to be wiped off, but by the Death of his Rival; and that he dur&s;t not pre&s;ume to throw him&s;elf at his Maje&s;ties Feet, without his Permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>His Letter met with a favourable reception from the King; but neverthele&s;s, order'd him to keep him&s;elf concealed for &s;ome time, for fear that if he &s;hou'd immediately appear at his Lodgings at Court, the whole Family of the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> would unanimou&s;ly complain of his partiality, to &s;ee him in the &s;ame degree of Favour as before.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> upon her arrival in <HI>London,</HI> went to her Nur&s;es, the only place where &s;he could hope for a kind reception. What a &s;trange turn of Fortune? for the hand|&s;ome&s;t Lady in the Kingdom, born to &s;o great an E&s;tate, and related to all the Great Men of the Court: What an odd Change, I &s;ay, for a Lady of her Age, who had &s;acrifie'd her Inclination to her Vertue, and who had nothing that was mate|rial to reproach her &s;elf with! 'Tis true, her Innocence was her only Comfort; and had &s;he been otherwi&s;e, her Guilt would have much in|crea&s;ed her Misfortunes. She writ Letters to all her Family, &s;he &s;poke to the Earl's Executors to
<PB N="87" REF="293">
act with her in concert, to pro&s;ecute the Earl of <HI>Warwick:</HI> But the&s;e were &s;o far from doing &s;o, that they treated her very har&s;hly; and told her, they would bring an Indictment again&s;t her, and that &s;he had be&s;t to look to her&s;elf, &s;ince &s;he would find it one of the harde&s;t peices of work &s;he had ever met with in all her Life. A recep|tion &s;o different from what &s;he had promi&s;ed to her&s;elf, both &s;urprized and afflicted her to the highe&s;t degree: She then endeavoured a Recon|ciliation with the Earl and Counte&s;s of <HI>Angle&s;ey;</HI> and their Affection for their Daughter was not &s;o far extingui&s;h'd, but that it might have been re-kindled again, had the good effects thereof not been prevented by tho&s;e that did her a thou|&s;and ill Offices with them.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Misfortunes were not able to &s;ubdue her Courage: She had taken a Re&s;olution (the mo&s;t difficult of all) to demand Ju&s;tice again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> and all the Ob&s;tacles &s;he met in her way, was not comparable to that. She threw her&s;elf at the King's Feet, in her Widows Robes, and tho' her Eyes were drown|ed in Tears, they had not lo&s;t their force. The King thought her now a thou&s;and times more hand&s;ome than when &s;he fir&s;t made him her Conque&s;t, and the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> appear'd a thou&s;and times more, guilty to him, to have known how to get &s;o far the A&s;cendant over &s;o charming a Per&s;on, which had made him kill the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI> He promi&s;ed the Counte&s;s to treat her Enemy according to the utmo&s;t rigour of the Law, being very much plea&s;ed to have an op|portunity of tormenting her in a way &s;he dur&s;t not complain of; for whatever precaution &s;he took not to betray her Sentiments by her Looks, the young Monarch &s;oon di&s;covered her unea&s;ine&s;s: Thus they revenged them&s;elves upon one another,

the King by Threatning the Per&s;on beloved by the Counte&s;s, and &s;he in di&s;covering her favour|able Inclinations for his Rival.</P>
<P>Soon after, &s;he found that her Name was in|&s;erted al&s;o in the Bill pre&s;ented again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> and that they were for &s;ecuring her Per&s;on, to call her to account, where &s;he had ab&s;conded her&s;elf during her Ab&s;ence from her Family. This new Di&s;grace obliged her to have recour&s;e to the King's Protection; which &s;he did one Evening when &s;he knew he had not been very well that Day; and that notwith&s;tanding this, orders had been given by his Maje&s;ty, that &s;he &s;hould be admitted into his Clo&s;er. She had a long Veil over her Face; and as &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing in a Chair, along a dark Gallery, a Gentleman wrap'd up in his Cloak, &s;topping the Chair-men, <HI>Whither are you going, Madam?</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>Have you forgot the King's Pa&s;&s;ion, and what Prai&s;es he has be&s;towed upon you but lately? Oh! cruel Woman, you intend to make me a Sacrifice to this dangerous Rival; you will re-kindle the old Flame.</HI> The Counte&s;s, by the&s;e Words, knowing him to be the Earl of <HI>Warwick: Alas! don't you know,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>what a Condition I am reduced to? wou'd you have me de&s;troy'd by my Enemies? And are not you of the &s;ame opinion with me, that the King is &s;o deeply enamour'd with Madam</HI> Gray, <HI>that he thinks no more of me? I cannot re&s;t &s;a|tisfy'd upon that Point,</HI> reply'd the Earl, <HI>I am &s;en&s;ible, that the Impre&s;&s;ions you make are too lively to be &s;oon defaced: If the King &s;ees you once more, he will certainly fall in Love with you. I came ju&s;t now from him, and it was he that told me he expected your coming; he waits for you with the utmo&s;t impatience; but, Madam, for God's &s;ake don't go thither, &s;ecure me again&s;t a Mis|fortune I fore&s;ee will befal me.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="295">
<HI>You make me afraid of my&s;elf, my Lord,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I don't de&s;ire to be beloved by the King; &s;peak to him in my behalf, and get an order from him for me to be admitted into a Nunnery; for &s;ince I can't &s;ee you without being Criminal, contrive it &s;o that I may &s;ee nobody in the World.</HI> The Earl overjoy'd at this extraordinary piece of Complai&s;ance of the Counte&s;s, return'd her a thou&s;and thanks; a&s;&s;uring her, he would omit nothing to obtain the Order &s;he de&s;ired from the King. However, when he began to intimate to the King the re&s;olution the Counte&s;s had taken of retiring into a Nunnery, this Prince told him he would never con&s;ent to it; and that &s;ince &s;he had no &s;uch Thoughts when he &s;aw her la&s;t, this mu&s;t be the product of his Coun&s;els to her. The Earl being not a little &s;urprized at the King's An&s;wer, was now fully convinc'd, that neither Time, nor all the Charms of Madam <HI>Gray,</HI> had been powerful enough to ra&s;e out of the King's Mind, the Impre&s;&s;ions made there by the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire;</HI> and that there|fore it was high time for him to per&s;uade her to conceal her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Tho' the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s Authority was very great at that time in <HI>England,</HI> yet out of a Decorum in re&s;pect of the Death of the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> he &s;aw none but his intimate Friends. The Marque&s;s of <HI>Montague</HI> did the &s;ame, his Wounds proving &s;o dangerous, that his Life was more than once de&s;pair'd of, becau&s;e the little care he took of it, proved a great hinderance to his Cure. The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> wou'd fain have been con&s;tantly with him; but his Pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> call'd him to other Places, where he might do her the mo&s;t effectu|al Service.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="296">
This fair Widow as &s;oon as &s;he under&s;tood the King's refu&s;al to let her go into a Nunnery, was contriving a place of Retirement, where &s;he might remain unknown to all the World: She &s;tood in need of the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s a&s;&s;i&s;tance, without which &s;he found it would be very difficult for her to compa&s;s her De&s;igns. He cau&s;ed to be purcha&s;ed a Hou&s;e, privately, which made but a &s;lender appearance on the out &s;ide; but &s;o mag|nificently adorn'd within, that the Palace of <HI>P&s;yche,</HI> built by Love it&s;elf, could not be more plea&s;ant or more agreeable. The Counte&s;s was very willing to accept of this Retirement, pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">i|ded the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> wou'd not come there to &s;ee her; being per&s;uaded, that &s;he could not, without Guilt, continue a &s;trict Corre&s;pondence with a Man who had kill'd her Husband: And the Earl fearing, le&s;t &s;he &s;hou'd be di&s;covered in her Lodgings, unle&s;s &s;he went thither with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, promi&s;ed to do every thing &s;he de&s;ired. The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> &s;ent <HI>Berincour</HI> to attend her at her new Hou&s;e, whil&s;t he &s;tay'd at <HI>London</HI> with the Marque&s;s of <HI>Montague.</HI> He had been in no &s;mall danger from his Enemies, could the King have been prevail'd upon to leave him to their Mercy; but the Friend&s;hip he bore him put a &s;top to their De&s;igns; &s;o that tho' they without intermi&s;&s;ion reiterated their In&s;tan|ces for the King to leave him to the ordinary cour&s;e of the Law, he always found means to put them off by ambiguous An&s;wers; till they were convinced that all their Sollicitations were likely to be in vain. The Counte&s;s on the other hand, now began to flatter her&s;elf, that living in this place of Retirement, without the lea&s;t noi&s;e or lu&s;tre, &s;he wou'd &s;oon be forgot by all the World; when the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> now deep|er in Love with her than ever he had been be|fore,
<PB N="91" REF="297">
found out her Hou&s;e, and left no &s;tone un|turn'd, to get admittance there: 'Tis true, this was no ca&s;ie task to be compa&s;s'd; but in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> as in mo&s;t other Countries, there are few things which may not be purcha&s;ed by Money.</P>
<P>The Earl found means to engage one of the Counte&s;s's Waiting women into his Intere&s;t; &s;he opened to him a little Back gate, by which he entred into a mo&s;t curious Flower-garden, where her Mi&s;tre&s;s u&s;ed to walk every Night. He lay concealed betwixt a Hedge of Trees, when he &s;aw her coming along negligently dre&s;s'd in Mourning, and more beautiful than the Mother of Love her &s;elf: The &s;ight of her put him in|to an un&s;peakable confu&s;ion; for if he loved her beyond all the World, he re&s;pected her no le&s;s, and feared to di&s;oblige her, if he acco&s;ted her. She will doubtle&s;s, &s;ays he, be offended at the liberty I take: All the imprecations I can make will not clear me from the &s;u&s;picion &s;he has conceived of my being one of the mo&s;t intimate Friends of Madam <HI>Gray.</HI> Nay perhaps &s;he may fancy I am in Love with her; but &s;he will &s;carce think it worth her while to reflect thus far, the happy Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> takes up all her thoughts, and &s;he little concerns her &s;elf about me. The Coun|te&s;s had already taken &s;everal Turns in the Gar|den, before he dur&s;t venture to come out from behind the Hedge, but at la&s;t he did, throwing him&s;elf immediately at her feet. She frightned to the heart, run away, and the Earl thinking &s;he knew him, and that what &s;he did was out of an aver&s;ion to him, re&s;olved to make her &s;en&s;ible of the Torments he &s;uffered for her: <HI>No, Madam,</HI> &s;aid he, keeping her back, <HI>No, I don't come here to deplore at your feet the&s;e unconceivable Evils you make me &s;uffer, I come here to load you with</HI>

<HI>reproaches, as being the mo&s;t cruel of all Women living.

<P>The &s;ame moment the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> e&s;py'd the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> what a &s;urprizing &s;ight for an amorous and jealous Per&s;on!

<P><HI>How! is it you my Lord!</HI> cry'd the Earl of <HI>War|wick, is it po&s;&s;ible your Curio&s;ity &s;hould lead you &s;o far beyond its bounds, as to forget what is ow|ing to a per&s;on of that Quality and Merit as my Lady</HI> Devon&s;hire <HI>is?

<P>As for the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> he u&s;ed frequent|ly to commit &s;uch Errors in his Pa&s;&s;ion, as he heartily repented of afterwards; and &s;o it hap|pened in this ca&s;e. He run away like a Madman, to Madam <HI>Gray,</HI> and told her what he had &s;een in relation to their common Enemies. She, plea|&s;ed to the heart to have found &s;o fair an oppor|tunity of revenging her &s;elf of them, without more ado told it to all the World, that the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> not &s;atisfy'd to have drawn &s;o many misfortunes upon her Family, liv'd near <HI>London</HI> in a Hou&s;e belonging to the Earl of <HI>Warwick.</HI> This piece of hers &s;o nearly touch'd the whole Family of this Lady, that it is not to be expre&s;s'd, how many ill effects it produced to her; and the Executors of the late Earl obtain'd an Act, laying a Fine of one hun|dred Marks of Gold upon the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> to be paid by him as often as he &s;hould go to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>The Earl was little concern'd thereat, as on the other hand it proved &s;ome &s;atisfaction to the Counte&s;s: <HI>I &s;hall now,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>be freed from the hazard of receiving his Vi&s;its, which mu&s;t have always been attended with a thou&s;and trouble&s;ome Con&s;equences.

<P>Accordingly the &s;ame Night he conducted her with two Waiting women, di&s;gui&s;ed all three in Mens habit, to this &s;tupendious Vault, which for its beauty might challenge a preference to the mo&s;t Magnificent Palace.

There were &s;everal Clo&s;ets or Retiring places, the Doors whereof were &s;o artificially contrived, that no body but who was very well acquainted with it could open them. The Marque&s;s &s;hew'd the &s;ecret openings thereof to my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and fearing lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould forbid him to come to &s;ee her, if he con|tinued to entertain her with his Pa&s;&s;ion, he cho&s;e

<P>At the &s;ame time the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> per|&s;i&s;ting in his Re&s;olution of giving the King an account of the Counte&s;s, had placed him&s;elf in Di&s;gui&s;e al&s;o, not far from the before &s;aid Sub|terraneous place, when he &s;aw the Marque&s;s of <HI>Montague</HI> coming along with the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> whom he knew notwith&s;tanding the darkne&s;s of the Night, and her Di&s;gui&s;e, having &s;een her in the &s;ame Habit at Madam <HI>Digby</HI>'s; but had &s;he appear'd in another Dre&s;s, how was it po&s;&s;ible for him to mi&s;take her? That fatal Ar|row which pierced his heart when he met her at <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> with the Counte&s;s of <HI>Oxford,</HI> I &s;ay that &s;ame Arrow remain'd &s;till in his heart, with this difference only, that now he felt him&s;elf torment|ed only with the mo&s;t cruel Jealou&s;ie that could be, that he lived without hopes, and that he act|ed like a Man who cared not what he did. He run &s;traight to the King, and told him where my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> was lodged; and this Monarch &s;eeing him&s;elf now freed from that re&s;pect he pre&s;erved for the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> thought of nothing el&s;e than how to &s;urprize an unhappy per&s;on, de&s;titute of all Protection, and oppre&s;s'd by her Enemies. For this purpo&s;e he pitch'd up|on a very dark Night, and took no body along with him, except the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and the <HI>Chevalier de Herbert</HI> his Brother. Coming to the Entrance of the Vault, which they found not without much difficulty, they &s;oon broke the Door. The noi&s;e thereof put the Counte&s;s and

Having narrowly &s;earch'd all the Corners of the Place, they concluded &s;he was gone from thence to another. <Q REND="inline">'Why would I delay coming hither? cry'd the King; I had certainly met with her here; where mu&s;t I look for her now?

<P>The King would not go away without making a &s;econd Search, through the whole Vault; and pa&s;&s;ing by a Looking gla&s;s fixed within the Mar|ble, he writ with his Diamond Ring the follow|ing words: <HI>Had I found her,</HI> Warwick <HI>&s;hould have &s;een her no more.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;eeing his &s;tay would be u&s;ele&s;s in that place, he went away &s;orely vex'd to &s;ee him&s;elf thus di&s;appointed in an attempt of this nature.

They no &s;ooner appear'd, but <HI>Pembroke</HI> and his Brother &s;eeing their Swords gli&s;ter, and not knowing who they were, advanced fiercely again&s;t the Counte&s;s; but &s;he being carele&s;s of her life, threw her &s;elf &s;o furiou&s;ly upon the Earl, that &s;he put his Life in danger. She wounded him with her Sword, and was going to &s;econd the blow, had &s;he not per|ceived that he began to retreat without offering to fight any longer. In effect, he then knew her, and his Pa&s;&s;ion triumphing over all his other Re|&s;olutions, he would not fight nor &s;top her; and when the <HI>Chevalier Herbert</HI> drew near to revenge his Brother's Quarrel, he held him by the Arm: Thus the fair Counte&s;s opening her &s;elf a pa&s;&s;age through her Enemies, left her Subterraneous dwelling place, and went to another, where &s;he was a&s;&s;ured of the Fidelity of her Friends.</P>
<P>'Twas next to an Impo&s;&s;ibility the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> &s;hould be Wounded, and the thing not be &s;oon known at Court. The King being in|form'd of all that pa&s;s'd by the <HI>Chevalier Her|bert,</HI> was vex'd to the Soul, to have mi&s;s'd of the Place where the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> lay concealed; and he could not forbear to be di&s;&s;a|tisfy'd with the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> and his Bro|ther, becau&s;e they did detain him no longer.

There was not a word &s;aid at Court of the King, no more than of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> the whole News run upon a Rencounter betwixt &s;ome Men, &s;o that the matter &s;eem'd plain enough to every body, but to her, who notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e probable Appearances, could not get it out of her thoughts but that this Adventure concern'd chiefly the King and the Counte&s;s. The Marque&s;s of <HI>Montague</HI> was in a wor&s;e condition than all the re&s;t, he came to &s;ee his dear Counte&s;s, but found her not. What an Agony was he in, when he &s;aw a long tract of Blood, &s;ome of the Movea|bles and the Doors broken to pieces! He could think no otherwi&s;e than that &s;he had been carry'd away by force; he accu&s;ed all the World with it, &s;ometimes the King or <HI>Pembroke,</HI> &s;ometimes the Counte&s;s's Enemies; his pain was un&s;peaka|ble till he under&s;tood that the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> had been Wounded. After all, this piece of News gave occa&s;ion to more Reflections. He that had Wounded him, mu&s;t needs be the &s;ame per&s;on that came thither to per&s;ecute the Counte&s;s; and con&s;idering that he would be fool-hardy enough to venture upon &s;uch an Attempt, were it only in regard of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> the more he thought of the matter, the more he was con|firm'd in his opinion, that the King was at the head of the Party; but what means was there to unfold this Riddle, it being uncertain whether my Lady <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> was at liberty or not?</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="321">
The King needed to have acted with much more circum&s;pection than actually he did, in an Affair of &s;o peculiar a nature, to keep it from the knowledge of Madam <HI>Gray,</HI> who had many Creatures of her own, who made their Court to her at the expence of King <HI>Edward.</HI> She would lo&s;e no time to be further &s;atisfy'd in the matter, but taking a Chair attended by a few only, went to the Place, where &s;he found the Doors broke open, and entring with much precipitation, found the Marque&s;s of <HI>Montague</HI> there, &s;till bu&s;ied in &s;earching every corner of the place.

<P>The Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was continually &s;ollici|ted to come over into <HI>England,</HI> where as they told him every thing was ready, they only want|ing his Pre&s;ence.

<P>There was one ob&s;tacle in the way, <HI>viz.</HI> a &s;trong Squadron of Ships of the Duke of <HI>Bur|gundy</HI>'s, which were Cruizing on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t, to prevent the Tran&s;portation of any Troops out of <HI>France</HI> thither.

Her delicious red and white Com|plexion, changed into a deadly palene&s;s: They endeavoured to draw her away by force; but &s;he &s;queezing the Earl's Hand clo&s;e to her Bo&s;om, fetch'd a very deep &s;igh, and &s;o expired in the Arms of her Woman, before they were able to remove her from the place, or give her any real A&s;&s;i&s;tance; happy in her Misfortunes, becau&s;e her Grief would not &s;uffer her to out-live what &s;he loved.</P>
<P>The Extraction of the Counte&s;s was &s;uch, and her Beauty &s;o extraordinary, and &s;o much cele|brated,

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From an Engli&s;h Gentleman in <HI>France,</HI> to his
Si&s;ter in <HI>England,</HI> giving her an Ac|count of the Change of that
Court from Gallantry to Devotion, or from open <HI>Irre|ligion</HI> to
<HI>Hypocri&s;y.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>HELA!</HI> my <HI>pauvre</HI> Si&s;ter, &s;aw you but the Au&s;terities of <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> and St. <HI>Ger|mains,</HI> you would no longer be of O|pinion, that the Court of <HI>England,</HI> was &s;o in|ferior to 'em in Splendor and Delights. I look upon my &s;elf no better than a bani&s;h'd Man, and one grown old in Exile from his Native Country, his Friends, and Family. 'Tis true, my Duty obliges me to be here; but alas! how &s;evere a Plea&s;ure is that reckon'd, with what I can (now but barely) reflect on? Ev'n thou, my Si&s;ter, art little better than a Name to me. I left thee &s;o young, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to have any Idea of thee; not but Nature, or Impul&s;e, or what you plea&s;e, gives me an unaccountable Fondne&s;s for a Per&s;on I am wholly a &s;tranger to; &s;ince, my Dear, you can no longer pre|tend to be that beautiful little Creature of four Years old, who&s;e Image, with all her pretty Prattle, I &s;till retain; yes, I &s;ay, thou art now another She: Thy Per&s;on and Under&s;tanding at its growth, and I do not que&s;tion but that they equally de&s;erve our Admiration: The la&s;t I can read in thy inimitable Letters: Therefore want|ing
<PB N="4" REF="385">
the beautiful Sub&s;tance of the other, let me at lea&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the lovely Shadow. You have promi&s;ed me your Picture, pray do not delay it, (for that in any de&s;ired Ble&s;&s;ing is a &s;ort of a Refu&s;al.) I leave it to your own choice, whe|ther in great or little; 'tis equal to me, whe|ther I'm oblig'd to <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> or <HI>Kneller,</HI> for the knowledge of my Si&s;ter, or any other Arti&s;t, that may perhaps have &s;ince out-&s;tript them in Reputation; tho' when I was &s;o happy to be in <HI>England,</HI> they were de&s;ervedly e&s;teem'd the be&s;t.</P>
<P>I find Nature to be the &s;ame in all Countries, and that whil&s;t there be Women, they will have Curio&s;ities! What is the News of our World to yours? Would you have me write Novels in|&s;tead of Letters? I am told in your la&s;t, that the fir&s;t thing you do in receiving mine, is in con&s;idering the quantity, from thence to &s;et a Price or Value upon the whole; ah, my dear Si&s;ter, Truth and Kindne&s;s are not always the mo&s;t voluminous! We may &s;ay the deare&s;t ten|dere&s;t Things in a little room; can any thing be more expre&s;&s;ive than the&s;e words, <HI>I love?</HI> All other Terms of Pa&s;&s;ion are but derived from thence, and yet how little Paper do they imploy? 'Tis not then the Friend&s;hip in mine that you regard, 'tis the News it affords; and in this, my dear Si&s;ter, I am afraid you &s;hew your &s;elf little better than a plain Go&s;&s;ip; but becau&s;e I'm not well enough acquainted with you to chide, it &s;hall be a happine&s;s to me, that any way I can make a bani&s;h'd Brother's Re|membrance acceptable to you.</P>
<P>But to begin with the Court at <HI>Ver&s;ailles;</HI> it has an Air of nothing but Devotion; 'Tis no longer there that Gallantry appears barefaced; <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. &s;eems to have out-liv'd him&s;elf, and
<PB N="5" REF="386">
the gay Cu&s;toms of the former part of his Reign; That univer&s;al Spirit of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Plea|&s;ure,</HI> (that &s;way'd every Heart with ab&s;olute Power) is now no more! Tho&s;e noble A&s;&s;em|blies are di&s;&s;olved, where Love was permitted to &s;hew it &s;elf without di&s;gui&s;e! Then without wonder, two <HI>Lovers</HI> (in&s;pired by the &s;ame de|&s;ire) might enjoy their mutual Plea&s;ures, for Scandal was lo&s;t where all were guilty! Nor could the well-manner'd Per&s;ons of either Sex, make their Court more <HI>adroitly</HI> to their Mo|narch, than by &s;orting them&s;elves to his Incli|nation! Whence proceeds &s;o di&s;mal a Change? Is it becau&s;e his Age has varied the Sea&s;on? Be it &s;o, but 'tis not generous to forbid <HI>Love</HI> to others, becau&s;e he has out-liv'd the force of it him&s;elf; can any thing be more envious? Were it in his power, I believe the whole World &s;hould be of one Age and Ta&s;te, and not a Mortal appear at Court under Sixty odd: Then Beads and Reliques might be in &s;ea&s;on, tho' nothing el&s;e is now to be &s;een there, with dull <HI>&s;eemingly-Religious</HI> Faces! Nor Di&s;cour&s;es to be heard but of <HI>Saints Days,</HI> and their <HI>Vigils; Hypocri&s;y</HI> has di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd <HI>Love</HI> from its lawful and beautiful Throne, and like mo&s;t ab&s;olute u&s;urping Tyranny, reigns unea&s;ily, and not without pain reduces his Subjects to &s;ubmit to its unbounded Power. Oh! were it po&s;&s;ible to look into the King's Brea&s;t, to &s;ee if his <HI>Devotion</HI> be true, and how it comes to pa&s;s, that he &s;hould have Remor&s;e for no other Sin but that, which he is no longer in danger of committing, [<HI>Love</HI>] which perhaps has been the lea&s;t Criminal of all his Actions? How is it he &s;till remains unwearied with Per&s;ecution, and Power, that he knows not how to permit any other Monarch in <HI>Europe</HI> to be at ea&s;e, un|le&s;s
<PB N="6" REF="387">
they be in effect his Creatures? Can this be real <HI>Piety?</HI> Can this be true <HI>Devotion?</HI> Oh, no! <HI>Religion</HI> is always equal and con&s;i&s;tent in all things, and no more indulges <HI>Sin</HI> with, than again&s;t, Inclinations. His Vices then have only &s;hifted the &s;cene,<Q>Tired with Love and &s;urfeited with Joy.</Q> He hunts with Plea&s;ure the unwearied Round of <HI>Ambition; Ambition</HI> which has this of admirable in it, is, that &s;till as one Hope is defeated, 'tis re|cruited with another; and of all the Pa&s;&s;ions 'tis the late&s;t cloy'd. <HI>Ambition,</HI> that exorbitant De|&s;ire! which is never &s;ufficiently gratify'd, but &s;till encrea&s;es with Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and which has &s;o en|tirely fill'd the Soul of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. that all his Actions are &s;ub&s;ervient to it. Hence it is that with &s;uch an au&s;tere Air he a&s;&s;umes Devotion, as an unque&s;tion'd Veil to all his Tyranny; nay, 'tis &s;o &s;everely practis'd, that a poor young La|dy, if &s;he be but &s;u&s;pected to have a <HI>Lover,</HI> has a Letter of <HI>Lachet</HI> &s;ent her to withdraw, as too Libertine an Ornament for a <HI>Holy Court.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Severities (my dear Si&s;ter) pa&s;s not without Complaint among tho&s;e Per&s;ons, whom <HI>Youth</HI> and <HI>Beauty,</HI> have fitted for other Diver|&s;ions. The Ladies (I believe) would not be di&s;pleas'd to &s;ee a younger Prince upon the Throne, who has three Sons, all di&s;po&s;ed to gay and &s;ofter Inclinations; &s;o that we may ju&s;tly &s;ay, The whole Nation groans under <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Tyranny! And that if he oppre&s;&s;es the Men with <HI>Taxes, Per&s;ecution,</HI> and <HI>War,</HI> he no le&s;s con|&s;trains the Women by <HI>Devotion.</HI> I was &s;itting at my ea&s;e behind a Fountain in the Garden at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> the other Evening, when two Court Ladies came to repo&s;e them&s;elves near me; I
<PB N="7" REF="388">
was hid from 'em by a Myrtle hedge; thus they di&s;cours'd, <HI>Ah, ma belle Comte&s;s,</HI> (crys one of 'em) of what value is Youth and Beauty in &s;uch a Court as this? We either are not admired, or they mu&s;t not di&s;cover it to us, that we are. Will not old <HI>Age,</HI> or ill Faces &s;erve well enough to follow the old in&s;en&s;ible Monarch to <HI>Marli,</HI> or Madam <HI>Maintenon</HI> to St. <HI>Cyr?</HI> Thank God I do not want Devotion, but I would not altogether forget I am young, and &s;urely born to ta&s;te other Joys than what ari&s;e from Cant and Pray|er; nay, they teach our very Husbands to be|lieve that the Delights of Marriage &s;hould have &s;omething &s;evere in 'em, and that Exce&s;s in all things (but Religion) is to be condemn'd. But their Opinions I could ea&s;ier forgive, than tho&s;e Severities, that forbid to us the innocent Plea|&s;ure of <HI>Admiration,</HI> which let a Woman be never &s;o hone&s;t, &s;he cannot mi&s;s without Inquietudes. Oh, the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing one's &s;elf admired by a Crowd of Adorers, all eager to oblige, watching every Glance; Catching at every turn of my Eyes or graceful Nod; Pre&s;&s;ing to do me &s;ervice; prai&s;ing, as I pa&s;s, my Face, my Shape, my Manner: This Air all langui&s;hing, the next moment more gay, all plea&s;ing. Let me tell you, 'tis in&s;ufferable Tyranny, inverting the Order of Nature, a Tax upon our Youth and Beauty &s;o exorbitant, that Age and Ugline&s;s is of as great an u&s;e and value; and we might have as well been born <HI>old,</HI> as live <HI>young</HI> to &s;o little purpo&s;e as we do.</P>
<P>I may venture (my dear Si&s;ter) to affirm, that in this Lady's, I &s;end you the general O|pinion, and pre&s;ent State of the Feminine Court; &s;ee then if it can po&s;&s;ibly afford tho&s;e &s;ort of Adventures which you &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately beg to hear. I &s;uppo&s;e 'tis otherwi&s;e with you,
<PB N="8" REF="389">
the Sun &s;eems to ri&s;e on the Succe&s;&s;es of that Court, as it is declining or &s;etting here; all things appear to us like faded Glories, we droop, we langui&s;h, as Per&s;ons without Hope. We fear all Accidents &s;ince none of late have hap|pened to our Advantage. My dear Si&s;ter, adieu, and believe I pa&s;&s;ionately love and embrace you once more. Adieu.</P>

&s;alacious Amours of Madam <HI>Mon|te&s;pan,</HI> one of the French King's
Mi&s;tre&s;|&s;es, with Lords, Gentlemen, Players, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Imagine (my dear Si&s;ter) that you who are &s;o full of Curio&s;ity, cannot but have read &s;ome of the many <HI>Memoirs</HI> that have been tran|&s;lated, and printed in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> concerning Ma|dam <HI>de Monte&s;pan,</HI> a former and beautiful Mi|&s;tre&s;s of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. You mu&s;t therein have found, how he took her from her Husband (the late Marquis <HI>de Monte&s;pan</HI>) who retired extream|ly di&s;&s;atisfied from Court, at the Prerogative his Royal Ma&s;ter u&s;urp'd, of taking from Hu&s;|bands their Wives, whenever they appear'd Charming to him. Madam <HI>de Fontange</HI> &s;ucceed|ed her in the King's Favour; for (alas!) what Love is there that remains always the &s;ame? What Ardours are there which Time does not abate? What Enjoyment that long de&s;erves to be called &s;uch? What Tran&s;ports that do not fade, ev'n before the Beauty that in&s;pires 'em?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="390">
Madam <HI>Monte&s;pan,</HI> who had never any great Pa&s;&s;ion for the Per&s;on of the King, &s;aw his Change with le&s;s concern than any other wou'd have done, and endeavour'd to comfort her &s;elf for his Lo&s;s, in the Arms of a Thou&s;and others: In &s;hort, &s;he has made her &s;elf &s;o great a Slave to Sen&s;ual Love; enriching Worthle&s;s People to her own Ruin, that we &s;ee her at this day the mo&s;t de&s;pis'd, from the mo&s;t admir'd of her Age. And whereas ano|ther, in lo&s;ing the King's Affections (for the Ho|nour of tho&s;e Children &s;he has had by him) wou'd have endeavour'd to retrieve her Reputation, and improv'd the great E&s;tate the King's lavi&s;h Love had be&s;tow'd upon her; She has run counter to all di&s;cretion, and very often &s;een her &s;elf, with|out a Jewel, the &s;malle&s;t piece of Plate, or per|haps one Pi&s;tole. Undone between <HI>Cards</HI> and <HI>Lovers,</HI> &s;he has &s;carce left her &s;elf a bare Sub&s;i|&s;tence; and had not the King wi&s;ely fore&s;een the prodigality of her Temper, and &s;ettled eigh|teen Thou&s;and Crowns a Year to be paid her weekly; I dare affirm, that long ere this &s;he had not had wherewith to eat; but nothing made her &s;o de&s;picable, as her calling that ugly fellow (but excellent Comedian) <HI>Labrunne</HI> from the <HI>Stage</HI> to her Service and <HI>Bed;</HI> where, as <HI>Gentleman of the Hor&s;e,</HI> he rul'd both his Lady and Family for &s;ome years, till being detected as a Traytor, the King &s;ent him to langui&s;h out the remainder of his Life at <HI>Pignerol.</HI> Madam <HI>Monte&s;pan,</HI> who had none of tho&s;e Romantick Weakne&s;&s;es, call'd Con|&s;tancy, &s;oon found wherewith to comfort her for the Comedian's ab&s;ence; for many Fellows more worthle&s;s (if po&s;&s;ible) &s;oon &s;ucceeded to her Fa|vour, in their Turns; among whom, the &s;ame Folly pur&s;uing her to her Old Age, &s;he receiv'd one who had, 'tis true, been hand&s;ome in the Eye of the whole Town; but &s;o long &s;ince, that every

body had forgot it but him&s;elf; he &s;till retain'd the Name, and was vulgarly call'd <HI>Hand&s;om Du Prez;</HI> tho he wou'd admit of no other Title but <HI>Mon&s;ieur le Comte du Prez, Count</HI> of the <HI>Sacred Roman Empire;</HI> and in &s;pight of what the He|raulds cou'd do, he gave the <HI>Roman Eagles,</HI> and bore 'em upon his Equipage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They at fir&s;t laugh'd at, and afterwards &s;lighted him as a Mad|man, and &s;o left him to his <HI>Imaginary Grandure.</HI> His Oeconomy, as to his Affairs, can have no better a Parallel than his Courage; for if one was little, t'other was le&s;s, and he was no better than a Beggar, when he apply'd him&s;elf in his Addre&s;s to Madam <HI>Monte&s;pan:</HI> Her Lord had bin dead about &s;ix Months, when &s;he marry'd this <HI>Imagi|nary Count;</HI> and I have heard &s;everal fay, that &s;he wanted but this la&s;t Act of Indi&s;cretion, or rather Height of Folly, to crown or clo&s;e her foregoing Life, and to make her de&s;cend to the Grave, as &s;he had liv'd, the mo&s;t de&s;ervedly de|&s;pis'd and &s;corn'd of any Woman living.</P>
<P>From &s;o old, &s;o fanta&s;tical, and &s;o ill, yet well|pair'd a Couple, what cou'd be expected but a new Scene of Follies? They were the Theme for Laughter of the whole Kingdom, and wou'd have &s;till better diverted, had they not bin &s;o far de|&s;pis'd, as to be neglected, and many of their Fol|lies &s;afe from being repeated as too worthle&s;s for Conver&s;ation. This ridiculous Garb, extrava|gant Equipage, and great Expence; with his <HI>Pa|rade</HI> through <HI>Paris,</HI> in Diamond Buttons, and other fanta&s;tical Calls to the Multitude, were the com|mon Theme among&s;t the <HI>Vulgar:</HI> For People of Condition had left to &s;peak of 'em; yet thus &s;afe|ly might he have flouri&s;h'd, if he had not joyn'd <HI>Ingratitude</HI> to the re&s;t of his <HI>Moral Virtues,</HI> and ill us'd that Lady from whence he drew his &s;upport. She had call'd to her Family a Grand-daughter of
<PB N="11" REF="392">
hers, nam'd Madam <HI>Briancon;</HI> a Lady, full of Youth and Fire, with more Beauty than Di&s;cre|tion; She was parted from her Husband for her criminal Conduct, or at lea&s;t the Appearance of it. Madam <HI>Monte&s;pan</HI> receiv'd her with open Arms; and as &s;he is pa&s;&s;ionately fond of new Fa|vourites, of what Sex &s;oever, nothing was well done but what Madam <HI>Briancon</HI> order'd. The Old Amorous Count of the <HI>Sacred Empire</HI> was &s;oon cloy'd with his Bride's antiquated Charms; nay, if you will believe Scandal, &s;he was no new thing to him, having &s;everal Years before, when <HI>Du Prez</HI> was in his Beauty, receiv'd him to her Arms: But however it were, he cou'd not every day &s;ee &s;o much Youth and Agreeablene&s;s as Ma|dam <HI>Briancon</HI> was Mi&s;tri&s;s of, without offering her his Heart. There is certainly a <HI>Lex Talionis,</HI> a Law of Retaliation in this World, as well as the next; and Madam <HI>Monte&s;pan,</HI> who was her &s;elf con&s;ummate in Ingratitude, and &s;carce ever be&s;tow'd a Favour upon the <HI>De&s;erving,</HI> now ta&s;ted the Return from her own <HI>Grandchild</HI> and <HI>Husband.</HI> Madam <HI>Briancon</HI> accepted his odious Love, be|cau&s;e it came well accompany'd with Money, and Pre&s;ents of whatever he cou'd give her of her Grandmother's, that was mo&s;t valuable; and &s;o often were they in their Amours, that the Old Lady quickly complain'd of being defrauded; That &s;he had indeed bought a Husband, but ano|ther had the greate&s;t and be&s;t Property in him: Her Tongue had ever bin too &s;hrill and bitter, not to be a Nui&s;ance to all that heard it; and if upon her Friends, her Intimates and Servants, where &s;he had no occa&s;ion, &s;he us'd loudly to ex|ert her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of &s;currilous Railing, what think you became of her, where &s;he was &s;o nearly con|cern'd? She tore, &s;he roar'd, and dry and old, as &s;he was, &s;he &s;queez'd out briny baleful Tears,
<PB N="12" REF="393">

<P>'TIS very true, Madam, your Lady&s;hip's Memory is mo&s;t exact; but I think you lay too great a &s;tre&s;s upon Accident, for I can term it no other, and you mu&s;t certainly be mi|&s;taken, in giving fore-knowledge to an Old poor woman, in a dirty Chimney-corner, becau&s;e &s;he hapned to tell the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e Darm&s;tadt,</HI> that once in two Years he &s;hou'd narrowly e&s;cape Death, if he did e&s;cape it.

After his Return to <HI>Germany,</HI> the King of the <HI>Romans</HI> care&s;s'd, and be&s;tow'd on him the Honour of his Friend&s;hip. The Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> was then Contracted, and Wedded by Proxy to <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Spain;</HI> &s;he was near related to our Prince: And when the King of the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;ent him to her Father's Court, to have the Ho|nour of attending her to her Husband (at that time, the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> was very hand&s;om) and tho' afterwards, at the Age of Two and thirty years, when we &s;aw him in <HI>England,</HI> he appear'd to us like a Man of Forty, Weather-beaten and fatigu'd, yet was he well made, of a good Mien and Height; his Eyes black, and unu&s;ually &s;weet; the Goodne&s;s of his Temper was vi&s;ible in his Countenance; he had a large Soul; generous to Profu&s;ene&s;s; believ'd well of all he convers'd with; and wou'd be but with Pain undeceiv'd, when he found that they an&s;wer'd not the Opi|nion he had of 'em. The Queen's Intere&s;t procur'd him the Viceroy&s;hip of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and he held his Court at <HI>Barcelona</HI> with extreme Splendor. When the King's Death, and the Turn of Affairs call'd him to Court, Cardinal <HI>Fortocarero</HI> did all that a cunning Politician cou'd, to draw him into
<PB REF="397">
the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t; but with a Faith un&s;haken to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> he rather cho&s;e to re&s;ign his Government, and return to <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>On his Highne&s;s's Arrival in <HI>Spain</HI> with the new Queen, he found at Court, the Prince&s;s Dowager of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">; &s;he was a young Widow, extreamly charming, and as &s;en&s;ible of the Pains of Love as of giving them. She could not &s;ee the graceful Per&s;on of the Prince, which vi&s;ibly con|fe&s;s'd the Hero, and ob&s;erve the good Qualities of his Mind by Conver&s;ation, without &s;ome &s;e|cret Wi&s;hes, that &s;he might not be indifferent to him; nor could the Prince behold &s;o uncommon a Beauty, without Ardent De&s;ires, that &s;he could look on him with a favourable Eye. There was &s;uch a Sympathy betwixt the &s;weet Tempers of the Queen and this Prince&s;s, that on the death of the King, &s;he retir'd to <HI>Toledo</HI> with her Ma|je&s;ty. The Prince as firm as his De&s;ires were, and as much as he ask'd the Love of the Prince&s;s, made Love give way to Bu&s;ine&s;s and Ambition, went to his Government without informing the Prince&s;s with his Pa&s;&s;ion, fearing the Declara|tion would oblige a longer Attendance than his Affairs, or the Service of the King would per|mit: And on the Death of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, he was forced to repair to <HI>Madrid,</HI> in order to quit a Command he could not pre&s;erve without a breach of that Honour which he always pro|fe&s;s'd; but before he left <HI>Spain,</HI> he went to take his leave of the Queen, with this &s;atisfacti|on that he &s;hould there &s;ee the charming Ob|ject of his De&s;ires. And tho' he could hope lit|tle from the &s;hort Time of his &s;tay, yet the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her, would not permit him to think of the Pain it might co&s;t him. He has often told me in Confidence, that the mo&s;t glo|rious Evening of his Life was that when he

went to take his leave of the Prince&s;s at <HI>Toledo,</HI> where the Cardinal had order'd the Queen to retire. After the u&s;ual Compliments, he told her Maje&s;ty the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Audience was to receive her Commands for <HI>Germany:</HI> The Prince&s;s waited his return from the Queen, and gave occa&s;ion for a Pa&s;&s;ion as agreeable as tor|menting; but before he retir'd, &s;he de&s;ir'd his Company to her Clo&s;et, for &s;he had &s;ome Bu|&s;ine&s;s with him which ought to be private: He gave her his hand to conduct her, and found her in an unu&s;ual Trembling and Di&s;order. When &s;he was &s;eated, and had paus'd &s;ome Mo|ments, with an enchanting Blu&s;h, which cover'd her beauteous Face with Vermillion, &s;he ca&s;t her langui&s;hing and &s;parkling Eyes upon him, and thus &s;weetly enquir'd, <HI>My Lord, have not Wo|men of &s;uch high Quality as mine, do you think, &s;ome Prerogative above other Women, or el&s;e what does Title &s;ignify? But alas! we have the &s;ame Weakne&s;&s;es with the re&s;t of our Sex; are &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ions; can hate as cruelly, and love as violently; but with this difference, that we are &s;el|dom beloved; at lea&s;t the fir&s;t time we are &s;ure to be made Victims to our Quality; and the Civil Laws of</HI> Spain <HI>oblige Widows of my Rank to retire to a Mona&s;tery.

That alone re&s;trains me from going into tho&s;e Heights, which Love requires from us.&mdash;Ladies of your beauteous Form</HI> (an&s;wer'd the Prince) <HI>(without the advantage of great Titles) are &s;ure to have all the Returns, that &s;o great a Ble&s;|&s;ing</HI>

<P>Whether his Highne&s;s obey'd, I dur&s;t not &s;o nicely enquire; but I think from that time he became faithle&s;s to the Duke <HI>d' Albuquerque</HI>'s Daughter. He &s;hew'd me the Prince&s;&s;es Picture done upon Vellum, which he always carried about him, without either Ca&s;e or Frame, in his Pocket-book. Her Hair was flaxen, her Eyes black, and full of the natural Sweetne&s;s u&s;ual to that Colour. He had it be&s;ides in Great hung up in his Clo&s;et, and when the Prince would indulge him&s;elf, it was in writing Letters to her of a prodigious length; I cannot &s;ay fine, for they &s;eem'd to want it; there were At|tempts of Pa&s;&s;ion in them, but nothing an&s;wer|able to tho&s;e of the Prince&s;s; which made me conclude hers truly the effect of Love, his only of Gratitude.

<P>I am &s;orry I can give you no more Particulars of this Amour; for I dur&s;t not pre&s;s the Prince to declare whether he were marry'd, or only promis'd. I believe the former. However, he did not long enjoy her Beauty; but, returning to <HI>Germany,</HI> was &s;ent to treat upon Secrets of

Not imagining it to be the Prince, be|cau&s;e they had not one Attendant; and <HI>Nugent</HI> wore his Hat, and treated him but as his Equal; he invited me to their little Lodging at <HI>Green|wich,</HI> which indeed was very &s;mall; nor had they any more than one Servant that waited, without a Livery: I &s;peak mo&s;t of the Modern Languages, and the Prince did me the Honour to be pleas'd with my Conver&s;ation; nay, &s;o far as to di&s;cover him&s;elf to me, and I per&s;uaded him back to Court, to apply him&s;elf to the Mini|&s;ters, who probably would pur&s;ue the Method the King had before his Death re&s;olv'd upon, for the next Campaign; the Queen graciou&s;ly receiv'd him, and in con&s;ultation with Count <HI>Wrati&s;law,</HI> the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s <HI>Envoy,</HI> it was re&s;olv'd according to King <HI>William</HI>'s Intentions, that the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> &s;hould be &s;ent to <HI>Portugal,</HI> to endeavour to draw that King from his Neutra|lity into the Alliance.

of <HI>France;</HI> for there are but few Negotiations &s;ecret in the Court of <HI>England;</HI> the Delays were &s;o unea&s;y, that it put him upon a &s;uper&s;titious piece of Weakne&s;s (and which indeed was his blind &s;ide) of hearing what <HI>A&s;trologers</HI> and <HI>For|tune-tellers</HI> would tell him. <HI>Nugent</HI> had pro|cur'd him &s;everal, among which one ignorant dirty Creature in <HI>White friars,</HI> a Month before his Departure, told him, that he &s;hould not go till the next Month; that he &s;hould receive his Di&s;patch the Sixteenth, depart the Seventeenth; but if he could &s;tay till the Eighteenth, his Voyage would have &s;ucce&s;s; but withal &s;aid, he &s;hould never come to <HI>England</HI> again.

They afterwards fell in at <HI>Vigo,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="408">
with all that Succe&s;s, which it will be &s;uperfluous to repeat to you.

<P>He return'd to <HI>England</HI> with the Duke of <HI>Or|mond,</HI> and was very well receiv'd at Court, not|with&s;tanding the Di&s;appointments he had met with, and the Mortification he had not long after of &s;eeing one of the Queen's Servants &s;ucceed, in what he had fail'd; the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> was drawn into the Alliance, and the Prince's Hopes were &s;till fairer than before; he &s;till maintain'd his Intelligence with the <HI>Catalonians,</HI> and the Court believ'd &s;o well of it, as to re&s;olve to &s;end a Fleet and Army to attend him, under the Command of the Earl of <HI>Peterborough.</HI></P>

I have dwelt too long upon the&s;e Fooleries, and yet I took 'em but as an introduction to a Greater. What the Fortune-telling Woman in <HI>White-Fri|ars</HI> had told the Prince of his Mi&s;tre&s;s carrying on the Affair he was then going about, con|firm'd him in the Opinion, that they had a &s;u|pernatural Knowledge, tho' &s;he had fail'd in that particular of his coming to <HI>England</HI> again. Somebody that he was repeating it too, told him that there was one Mrs. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> in <HI>White-Chappel,</HI> that was a perfect Witch; he pre&s;ently ask'd 'em if they had ever &s;een her? They &s;aid no, nor did not intend it; for tho' the &s;illy vulgar reputed her a Witch, they did not believe God

had given that Power to any. The Prince per|&s;waded two of 'em to go incognito with him, and at lea&s;t hear what &s;he cou'd &s;ay. They yield|ed to oblige him; and in a Hackney Coach, to <HI>Harrow-Alley</HI> away they go. The Prince was a Man that &s;eldom made an Appearance as to Dre&s;s, and that day was as plain as po&s;&s;ible. They came to the blind Alley on that &s;ide that goes into <HI>Goodmans-Fields,</HI> where they left the Coach, and walkt into the Alley, till they came to a little Ale-Hou&s;e, where upon a Board it was written, that Mrs. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> the Fortune-Teller liv'd there, up two pair of Stairs. They were carried into a dirty dining Room, enjoyning them&s;elves Silence, lea&s;t they &s;hou'd be overheard, and their own Words repeated to 'em as Prophe&s;y; after half an Hours waiting, they were &s;hown into a Clo&s;et, where Mrs. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> &s;at to attend 'em; 'twas &s;o &s;mall, the Prince repos'd him&s;elf upon a dirty pair of Stairs, that went up thence into a Garret. Her manner is to ask no Que|&s;tions, but taking the Per&s;ons two Hands to|gether, looks carefully in 'em; and then falls to telling, as fa&s;t as &s;he can, the pa&s;t the pre|&s;ent, and the future; this I'm &s;ure off, &s;he cou'd have no Intelligence of who the Prince was, nor his De&s;ign; for them&s;elves knew it not but ju&s;t as they went about it. After &s;he had di&s;patch'd the Ladies, the Prince took the Chair, and &s;at before the Witch; when &s;he had look'd into his Hands, &s;he told him &s;he did not know what to &s;ay to him. He ask'd her why? She an&s;wer'd becau&s;e he &s;hou'd be &s;omething greater than e|ver &s;he had &s;een; they laugh'd at her mi&s;take; &s;he proceeded to tell him, there was a certain great and very fair Lady, that wou'd make his Fortune, if he liv'd but two Years longer, and that he &s;hou'd be ea&s;y for the re&s;t of his Days,

die old, and in his Bed; but that an Eminent Danger threaten'd him, either by Fire, or Wa|ter. In two Years, the malevolence of his evil De&s;tiny wou'd be pa&s;t, that he had already e|&s;caped &s;everal hazards, one with a Sword in his Thigh, another with a &s;hot in his Head, and once Drowning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Prince in returning from the Witch, was very Melancholy, and told the Ladies that it was true, he had actually receiv'd two &s;uch Wounds; pull'd back his Perriwig, and &s;hew'd where the Musket-ball went into his Head, and worked out at his Neck. They laugh'd at the Prediction, yet one of 'em was &s;o far inclin'd to be|lieve, that &s;he re&s;olved to try her again; and taking a Friend with her that never had heard of Mrs. <HI>Ma&s;on,</HI> they chang'd Cloaths with their Chamber Maids, and went to her; &s;he apply'd her &s;elf to the Servants of the Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es and told 'em Fortunes accordingly, and to the Lady who had been there before, (whom &s;he did not know again) quite contrary to what &s;he had &s;aid when &s;he was there with the Prince, which inevitably &s;hows us, that &s;he has no o|ther In&s;piration but a random Gue&s;s; which &s;ometimes hits, but a thou&s;and times oftner mi&s;|&s;es, unle&s;s it were that Heav'n (who takes more than a common Care of Hero's) put into this ignorant Woman's Mouth, Words proper for the Subject; and by Super&s;tition fitting him to believe, gave him warning to be wary, how for two Years he continu'd to expo&s;e him&s;elf. But Love and Glory calling him, he hearkn'd not to any pre&s;ages of his evil De&s;tiny, tho' almo&s;t a Miracle was &s;hown; (for I reckon it a remote one, that Mrs. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> &s;hou'd happen upon the right Places where he was wounded;) nay tho' he believ'd all that &s;he &s;aid, as he has often a&s;|&s;ur'd me, and that his Blood was adu&s;t, and

melancholy with that belief; yet negligent of the Warning he had receiv'd, in hopes of being for ever Happy in the Arms of his Beauteous Queen, he ru&s;h'd thro' Clouds of Fire and Smoke at the Siege of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> to the fatal A&s;&s;ault, where he was laid dead by the Shot of a thou|&s;and Muskets, and all his hopes of Ambition and Love buried in that glorious Ruin.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">From a Lady to a Lady; being an Account of her own Adventures,
and Lo&s;s of her Lovers.</HEAD>
<P>YES my Dear, my Ever-valu'd Friend, you &s;hall here know all that my poor tortur'd Soul has &s;uffer'd, in the&s;e long cruel three Years &s;eparation. Have I one &s;park of Joy remaining in my Soul? Your Letter brought it forth; and tho' dead to Hope, and lo&s;t to Happine&s;s, or ev'n wi&s;h of Happine&s;s, I find &s;till a plea&s;ure in being e&s;teem'd by you. Oh <HI>Clorinda!</HI> in other Loves there is no Con&s;tancy; even Friend&s;hip to me is but in&s;ipid; fit only to amu&s;e a Soul un|feeling a more exalted Heat. Had our Sex been different, I fear, my Dear, by this, we had for|got to Love; or perhaps have learnt to Hate: Tho' that's a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o Foreign to my Mind, that, as yet, I am ignorant of what it means: My Soul re|bounds not at an Injury; engro&s;s'd by &s;ofter Pa&s;|&s;ions, it has no room to entertain &s;o rough a Gue&s;t.</P>
<P>You ask me the meaning of that melancholy Strain, that runs through all my Letters; and conjure me to explain my &s;elf with Friend&s;hip. You well remember me, that when we parted, I was envy'd by mo&s;t, and by all thought happy. 'Tis true, I had not &s;uffer'd Shipwrack then, but &s;ince. Oh, what have I not endur'd! Will you have patience to hear a three years Angui&s;h? 'Tis all dark; a melancholy Gloom; my gayer Genius is fled and lo&s;t in its Shades: I'm the Rever&s;e of what I was; no more the Plea&s;ure of the World; the Delight of Conver&s;ation; no more

<HI>belov'd,</HI> yet &s;till <HI>loving.</HI> Is there a Mi&s;ery beyond this? Is there a Rack in Nature I have not felt? May I not well complain? But to give you in particular my Misfortunes: You left me in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Heart worthy mine; but the World and Intere&s;t divided us: An Eminent Law-Suit ruin'd my Lover's Fortune, in which part of mine was involv'd, and left him no hopes of repairing it, but by a Wife more Rich than I cou'd be. The coming <HI>Term</HI> was to take him in Execution for a Sum too mighty for him to &s;truggle with. This was kept a Secret from me, for fear of my Di&s;quiets. At length, finding him exce&s;&s;ive me|lancholy and dejected, beyond what I cou'd ever have &s;u&s;pected from his Fortitude of Soul, he told me his Misfortunes, That he was undone; but his own Sorrows were incon&s;iderable to him in compari&s;on of mine. He was indeed by Promi&s;e, by Vows and Inclination my Husband: But &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d I call him to the performance, we both were lo&s;t; and mu&s;t expect to langui&s;h out the re&s;t of his life in Pri&s;on, oppre&s;s'd with Mi&s;ery and Wants: That &s;uch a Lady had been offer'd him for a Wife, con&s;iderable in her Fortune, and &s;o de&s;ti|tute of Charms, that it could not give me the lea&s;t Su&s;picion, that Incon&s;tancy had any part in what was his only Refuge, the la&s;t Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">k that could pre&s;erve him from Shipwreck. I took Time to weigh and examine the Truth of what he &s;aid; but was &s;oon convinced of his ill Cir|cum&s;tances, and could not &s;uffer my Heart to he|&s;itate a moment on what it &s;hould do, to &s;ave him; the Thoughts were death to me, that for my &s;ake, he &s;hould live poor, contemn'd, and wretched; I concluded, that tho' (like other Men) he might prove ungrateful, 'twas a more tolerable Evil, than having him (through my means) unfortunate. Let all, who have not ge|nerous

Souls (as I &s;uppo&s;e they will) condemn me for what they may call Weakne&s;s: But &s;ure <HI>Clorinda</HI> does better know how to value &s;o un|pre&s;idented a Sacrifice. I gave up all my Hap|pine&s;s to his Intere&s;t, and by Permi&s;&s;ion &s;aw him three Weeks after marry'd. Indeed, Misfor|tunes in pro&s;pect are only gue&s;s'd at; they are not to be de&s;crib'd till felt, tho' I had prepar'd my &s;elf for all that could be expected of Suffer|ings; yet when once I began to feel the real Load, I &s;unk under 'em; &s;ince he was &s;afe and happy, no matter what became of me; neither Honour nor Policy would permit his Vi&s;its, for his Engagements with me had been no &s;ecret; his Lady would &s;oon have heard of 'em, and con&s;equently have had her own and his Plea&s;ure poi&s;on'd that way. Be&s;ides, I was re&s;olved to put an end to a Flame, that could not now burn with Innocence: I gave my &s;elf up to the Di|ver&s;ions of the World, Vi&s;its Cards, Plays, all that ought to divert the Mind  <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> my Love was to &s;uffer a violent Death, &s;ince it would not re|&s;ign to a natural; but in vain, it with&s;tood the E&s;&s;orts of Rea&s;on, Diver&s;ions, Duty; it mock'd all my Endeavours, and augmenting by Re&s;i&s;t|ance, threw me into a violent Illne&s;s; out of which, I did not, but after much danger, reco|ver; the Pain was at my Heart, which the Phy|&s;icians had no Cure for.

My Heart &s;till engag'd, &s;till tortur'd by a Love, which I could not per&s;wade my &s;elf to be Criminal, becau&s;e I once had a Right and Title to his Love; though when I con&s;ider'd my &s;elf had releas'd all Pretences, I doubly blamed my Heart for per&s;evering; but Love is a Power too mighty for us to controul. I &s;aw my Murderer, and my old Wounds bleed afre&s;h at the fatal Sight; he complained of his own want of Happine&s;s, and &s;ecretly pleas'd my Heart by finding, if his Grief were le&s;s, his Sa|tisfaction was not more. How in&s;ignificant a Relief is this? How is it, that a Power &s;o migh|ty as Love, can be &s;erv'd, and find its account in Trifles? He complain'd, that Marriage had not an&s;wer'd his End; for though it &s;av'd him from impending Ruin, in his Law-Suit, and di&s;|charg'd his Execution; yet many other of his Debts being unpaid, gave him much unea&s;ine&s;s. That his Lady, like a right Widow, had &s;ecur'd the greate&s;t part of her Fortune to her own u&s;e; their Humours were extreamly different, and he had little Hopes of prevailing on hers, becau&s;e he wanted the fir&s;t Principles, that &s;hould give his their agrecable Motion; &s;he lov'd Flat|tery, as mo&s;t Ladies do, and he was not Ma|&s;ter of it; he had almo&s;t &s;aid of Kindne&s;s too: In &s;hort, he was too dangerous for my Conver|&s;ation; his Eyes had &s;till the &s;ame Beauty, his Words their u&s;ual Softne&s;s, and I think a cer|tain melancholy Air heightned all his Charms; &s;hould I dwell on every Circum&s;tance, the Con|ver&s;ation mu&s;t tire you; in a word, I tore my &s;elf from the&s;e Enchantments, and forbid my Heart &s;uch Criminal Delights: Yet my Torment pur&s;u'd me where&s;oever I fled; I had once more recour&s;e to the Country, and went by Recom|mendation

to Board in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> at a Gentleman's Hou&s;e, who, with his Family, were all Strangers to me. A Chronick Di&s;temper, which my Me|lancholy had contracted, could only expect its Cure from change of Air. The Family I was receiv'd into, con&s;i&s;ted of an old well-natur'd Gentleman, govern'd by his &s;pleenetick Wife, who had as much Cunning, as Nature alone could give her; and had her Education been good, her Wit might have been more con&s;iderable. They had formerly merchandiz'd, but being pretty ea&s;y in the World, had lately left off. A Bro|ther of hers liv'd in the Family, who had been bred up with them in their Way; he appear'd to me as a Per&s;on well made, and hand&s;ome, but perfectly unfa&s;hion'd, having had no Conver&s;a|tion, but Bu&s;ine&s;s; who declin'd Women's Com|pany, and rarely ever &s;poke among the Men; he &s;eldom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> at home, and I believe I was near &s;even Months in the Hou&s;e with him, before we had any Conver&s;ation, tho' you know me ea&s;y of Acce&s;s, and pleas'd with Company; my bu|&s;ine&s;s was to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ck Diver&s;ion which my ill Health had made perfectly nece&s;&s;ary to me.

<P>At length another Brother (the 'Squire of Mrs. <HI>Woudbe</HI>'s Family) came upon a Vi&s;it to <HI>Bri|&s;tol;</HI> he dre&s;s'd at the Ladies, had &s;een &s;ome of the World, was half bred, as to Gallantry, and about that pitch in Under&s;tanding; but good Natur'd, and a very hone&s;t Gentleman; what his Brother wanted in Tongue, he &s;upply'd; and 'twas not his fault if Conver&s;ation langui&s;h'd; his kind Endeavours would relieve it, though &s;ometimes at the Expence of his Reputation, as to Wit. (For 'tis very hard for great Talkers al|ways to e&s;cape Impertinence,) Mr. <HI>Peregrine Worthy</HI> was his Name; he quickly told me, that his Heart had been mortgag'd above the&s;e two Years, to a young Lady pa&s;&s;ionately fond of him; but he was one, whom her Father would not permit her to marry, becau&s;e his E&s;tate did not an&s;wer the Fortune he could give her. He was not &s;o young as his Brother by &s;ix Years, nor &s;o well &s;haped, but much more poli&s;h'd; and it came into my Head, by a malicious Diver&s;ion, to make him in Love with me, notwith&s;tanding his Engagement: It &s;eem'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters">erable, that any other Woman &s;hould be qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the Heart &s;he lov'd, whil&s;t I was &s;o unhappy to be de|priv'd of what I had adored. The general ill Opinion I had of all Mens Con&s;tancy, made me conclude I &s;hould have no great trouble in con|quering <HI>Peregrine</HI>'s; I look'd not at the Con&s;e|quence, nor had debated with my &s;elf what to do with that Toy, his Heart, or that Lumber, his Per&s;on, were they once made an Offering to me. What I wanted was pre&s;ent Amu&s;ement; for, as Poi&s;ons are &s;aid to expel Poi&s;ons, I would with all my Heart have lov'd any Thing, to put

out of my mind the Phantom that haunted me. But this was not the Diamond that was to cut mine; for tho' we enter'd into a Commerce of Gallantry, and after his departure writ Letters as mutually tender, as if we had been really touch'd; I &s;uppo&s;e we both remain'd unwound|ed by each other. All I know of my &s;ide is, that my former Pa&s;&s;ion found not the lea&s;t abate|ment; and therefore 'tis ea&s;y to conclude, a new one did not &s;ucceed. At length young <HI>Worthy</HI> fell &s;o ill, that his Life was for &s;ome time in danger. Mrs. <HI>Woudbe</HI> had Bu&s;ine&s;s call'd her to <HI>London;</HI> after &s;he was gone, I debated with my &s;elf, whether I &s;hould be &s;o ill-natur'd, to let a Bro|ther of the Family, where I was, die, and ne|ver give him a Vi&s;it. I knew he did not love Company, and lea&s;t of all, Ladies; but my good Manners and good Nature over-ruling, I re&s;olved to do my Duty, though it &s;hould prove unacceptable. I came to his Bed-&s;ide, and had a much civiller Reception than I ex|pected; the heighth of his Di&s;temper, as I then &s;uppo&s;ed, had ma&s;ter'd his Native Rough|ne&s;s. I found him in a violent Fever; and having too lately had an expen&s;ive Experience of what Phy&s;icians could do, I was able to ad|vi&s;e him in many things proper for the Reco|very of his Health. Had Mrs. <HI>Woudbe</HI> been there I &s;hould not have attempted it, for &s;he has that Quality peculiar to her &s;elf, to believe none be|&s;ides her &s;elf knowing in any thing; and that &s;he is ignorant of nothing. Mrs. <HI>Abigal</HI> the Surly, her Si&s;ter, of Thirty, (dull, and heavy in make, as well as Under&s;tanding) was his chief Nur&s;e. I had Compa&s;&s;ion for him, in the ill hands he was in, and therefore failed not to be often with him, which he &s;eem'd to receive very civilly; his Fever abated, but his Temper being melan|choly,
<PB N="57" REF="428">
the Di&s;temper had &s;o &s;eiz'd his Spirits, that I found it mu&s;t be a powerful Diver&s;ion of the Mind, that could be able to throw it thence; but whence it &s;hould proceed I could not gue&s;s, to a Man wholly free from Vice or Pa&s;&s;ions; I found his Under&s;tanding very good, what he did &s;peak, proper, and well imagin'd; and I doubted not but he would &s;hew us he had Wit enough, could he once di&s;pence with Cu&s;tom and Mode&s;ty, that had hitherto kept him &s;ilent. We read to him Books of Wit and Gallantry; I found he had a true Ta&s;te of things, and could commend in the right place; thus a &s;ort of Satisfaction &s;ucceeded Compa&s;&s;ion, and I felt my &s;elf better plea&s;ed in his Company, than I imagin'd I could have been. We grew acquaint|ed; his Conver&s;ation became free and genteel; we chanced to talk of <HI>Love,</HI> he prote&s;ted he ne|ver knew what the lea&s;t Spark of it meant; and my Judgment was, he never would, not con&s;idering that Nature makes nothing in vain; however, a defect of Con&s;titution might hap|pen. I talk'd of the <HI>Language of the Eyes;</HI> he innocently prote&s;ted, he knew not what I meant by that; neither could he imagine: Nay, was more and more confounded, when I told him <HI>Lovers Eyes could talk;</HI> he a&s;&s;ured me he never minded the difference of Glances, he thought all Eyes had the &s;ame Looks, tho' not the &s;ame Colour.

chanced one day to light upon <HI>Brown</HI>'s Tran&s;la|tion of <HI>Fontenel</HI>'s and <HI>Ari&s;taenetus</HI>'s Letters; he &s;eem'd mightily pleas'd with 'em; there was one from a Lady, who permits a Lover all but the la&s;t Favour, and gives him leave to touch her Brea&s;t, to ki&s;s her Eyes, her Mouth, and &s;queeze her with her Stays off; he could not imagine what Plea&s;ure could be taken in that. Not long after, we were returning (with Mi|&s;tre&s;s <HI>Abigal</HI>) late from a Vi&s;it out of Town, where we had been merrily entertain'd, and had all three, contrary to Cu&s;tom, drank enough to elevate us. <HI>Bacchus</HI> is counted a Friend to Love; after putting me into the Coach, young <HI>Worthy</HI> &s;taid not for Compliments, with Mrs. <HI>Abigal,</HI> but threw him&s;elf with a Gaiety (wholly new to him) on the Seat by me; 'twas dark, and tho' the &s;urly Maid was our Oppo&s;ite, in the Hu|mour we were all in, it pa&s;s'd for Raillery: He pretended to make the Lady's Experiment of &s;queezing, &s;ince he found I had only a Morning-Wa&s;tcoat on, thence he attempted to ki&s;s my Cheek, then my Lips; and if I'm not mi&s;taken, could no longer wonder where the Plea&s;ure was of <HI>That.</HI> After we came home, we continued the Frolick, &s;itting upon Mrs. <HI>Abigal</HI>'s Bed; he &s;ighed after every Ki&s;s, no ill Omen of a Heart touch'd with Plea&s;ure. I may truly prote&s;t to you, that for Nine &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Years, that I had been tormented with an unintermitting Pa&s;&s;ion, this was the only Moment that I fir&s;t found it &s;u&s;pended. I confe&s;s, I was then lo&s;t to any Thoughts but the pre&s;ent; there his Eyes fir&s;t gave, and knew the di&s;tinction of Looks; he could no longer boa&s;t of Ignorance, they had a Softne&s;s wholly new; &s;o full of &s;parkling Fire, &s;o Tender, nay, &s;o Pa&s;&s;ionate, that I catched the Di&s;temper into mine, and look'd on his with
<PB N="59" REF="430">
an uncommon Plea&s;ure; you may perhaps too nicely blame me for giving into tho&s;e Delights, but I was &s;uddenly betray'd by one, from whom I never expected any danger, and there|fore could not arm my &s;elf again&s;t it. I was al&s;o charm'd, with thinking my &s;elf the fir&s;t that gave him Wi&s;hes, that gave him De&s;ire, and Joy; that Heart, that formerly in&s;en&s;ible Heart, &s;eem'd no longer &s;o to me. I was pleas'd to encourage a Plea&s;ure that de&s;troy'd my for|mer Pain, and I found young <HI>Worthy</HI> had in an hour done more towards my Cure, than all my own whole two Years endeavour. Mrs. <HI>Abigal</HI> thought our Conver&s;ation &s;omething too Ten|der; the Wine working out in ill Nature with her, as in Kindne&s;s with us; &s;he was imperti|nent enough to have offended us, had &s;he been worth it. After this, when he found me alone, he would &s;ometimes pretend to the Plea&s;ure of a Ki&s;s, but never declar'd him&s;elf; &s;o that I be|lieved my &s;elf mi&s;taken, when I reckon'd upon my Conque&s;t. He took occa&s;ion to be always with me; we read, we walk'd, we eat together, but &s;till not a word of Love; he became unimagi|nably improv'd like <HI>Cymon</HI> for <HI>Iphigenia,</HI> in the Fa|ble; he dre&s;s'd, he di&s;cours'd, he no longer avoid|ed the Ladies Company. All the World wonder'd at the Change; he became genteel as any Body, and appear'd with as good an Air; I told you at fir&s;t, that he was perfectly well-&s;hap'd; to me, they attributed the&s;e Improvements, calling him my Scholar; my Pain was inverted from <HI>London</HI> to the Country. I would have given all the World to hear his Mouth confirm, what his Eyes &s;o often told me. What Laws? What Manners? What Cu&s;toms have our Sex? How mu&s;t we be Tantaliz'd? How Tortur'd? Why was it not permitted to &s;earch his Heart? Why
<PB N="60" REF="431">
not to ask him, if yet he knew whether there was a Deity call'd <HI>Love?</HI> Our perpetual Oppor|tunities, our long Conver&s;e, might have well excus'd it; but Mode&s;ty over-rul'd even Curio|&s;ity and Vanity: I was forced to &s;uffer in Un|certainty and Silence. Thus a whole Year run on &s;ince that Moment he fir&s;t began to make an Impre&s;&s;ion upon my Heart. At length, a|mid&s;t the plea&s;ing Liberty of un-number'd Ki&s;|&s;es, he brought out (with doubting Mode&s;ty) that tran&s;porting word, <HI>I love you.</HI> I could have &s;wore that till that minute, I never knew what Joy, what Plea&s;ure was; I could not &s;tay for Reflection, I could not &s;peak; I more than &s;poke; I hug'd him in an extatick manner, more Charming, more Intelligible than a Thou&s;and words. You have known, my dear <HI>Clorinda,</HI> the Force of Love; wonder not then, that thus, in me, he exerted his Tyrannick Sway; or think the Per&s;on I've de&s;crib'd, becau&s;e lower than my &s;elf in Rank, unworthy of my Heart; his was by inclination Noble, and <HI>Dryden,</HI> who &s;o well knew the Pa&s;&s;ions, tells us,<Q><L>Love either finds Equality, or makes it;</L>
<L>Like Death he knows no difference in degrees,</L>
<L>But plains and levels all.</L></Q> After that he would perhaps have no longer &s;crupled to &s;peak his Pa&s;&s;ion, but our Oppor|tunities of being alone were few; what was now no Secret to me, was long &s;ince, by his Actions, &s;u&s;pected by the Family. Mrs. <HI>Woudbe</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Abigal,</HI> were our perpetual Companions; nay, we had an additional Spy, a Friend of Mrs. <HI>Woudbe</HI>'s, that was received there upon &s;ome Misfortunes of her Husband. This was a Dam&s;el, that pretended to Airs and Charms; would ogle my Lover, and (whether
<PB N="61" REF="432">
by their de&s;ires, or her own Inclinations) attempted to have made a diver&s;ion of his Kindne&s;s. She offer'd at &s;o many Advances, that my jealous Eyes called 'em unpardonable. However, her Charms were no way dangerous, and I believe I need have given my &s;elf no pain that way. This Creature won upon my ea&s;y Nature by her A&s;&s;iduities; and &s;he us'd often to rally at Mrs. <HI>Woudbe</HI>'s fears for her Brother. Thus were we interrupted in the full Cour&s;e of our Amour; and 'twas impo&s;&s;ible to &s;peak with|out being over-heard, one or both of the Si&s;ters were perpetually upon the hearken. It was not &s;o when any other Company was with me, for I had a ridiculous Pretender or two out of the Town, which had not my Heart been engag'd, might perhaps have &s;erv'd me to laugh at. But I was ever unea&s;y, as well as <HI>Worthy,</HI> out of each others Company; and tho' we could only &s;teal a Glance, or &s;ometimes the Touch of the hand, Fancy improv'd our Plea&s;ures, and made them greater than any other Satisfaction out of our &s;elves! My fir&s;t Fires were in their full force, the Object only changed by an invi&s;ible Tran&s;|mutation. I lov'd to the heighth of all my former di&s;order, but it was with a more plea|&s;ing Pain, a &s;ecret Satisfaction, in having made a Conque&s;t over that hitherto inexorable Virgin Heart!</P>
<P>I conceive their Fears were, lea&s;t young <HI>Wor|thy</HI> &s;hould marry me; I was a Widow with an incumber'd Jointure, and his Affairs requir'd a Wife with a Fortune in ready Money. How|ever, our Intelligence had proceeded no farther than the word <HI>Love;</HI> and it &s;eems to me, that he had not form'd (no more than my &s;elf) any de&s;igns towards the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what he lov'd.</P>

Mrs. <HI>Woudbe,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Marwoud,</HI> (the Name of the other Lady) were invited to an Enter|taniment in the Town, that was like to hold till late! Mrs. <HI>Abigal</HI> was diverted another way, &s;o that I was left alone; the old Husband being a|broad upon his Occa&s;ions, Young <HI>Worthy</HI> Ignorant of their De&s;igns, (for they kept it from us) was likewi&s;e from Home: The Weather was hot, I undre&s;t my &s;elf, to a loo&s;e Night-Gown, and <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> Petticoat, and laid me down after Din|ner upon the Bed to &s;leep. Young <HI>Worthy</HI> re|turn'd by in&s;tinct, or the Whi&s;pers of his good Genius, as he calls it; and hearing all were gone out, came as u&s;ual to my Chamber: I ca&s;t my Eyes to the Door as it open'd, and &s;aw him with &s;o elevated a joy, that &s;carce gave him time to &s;hut it after him. For running to me as I lay, he threw him&s;elf upon my Mouth, and Eyes, and &s;o tran&s;portedly ki&s;s'd me, that I cou'd no longer doubt but his Mode&s;ty was giving place to his De&s;ires; when hearing &s;ome body come up the Stairs. (which an&s;wer'd exactly to my Chamber) I broke from his Arms, and opening the Door, was ready to &s;woon at the Sight of Mrs. <HI>Woudbe,</HI> return'd wery ill, or pretendedly &s;o: She wou'd have gone in but I &s;hut it after me, and directed her into the Dining-Room. She askt me who I had with me, I told her (in utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion) a Gentleman; She &s;aid why don't you then, Madam, go to him? So I mu&s;t, an|&s;wer'd I. And returning, &s;hut the Door after me, but the Key was left on the out&s;ide. Young <HI>Worthy</HI> &s;aw my Di&s;order, and the guilty Air which yet I cou'd not recover: I told him tho' we were never &s;o Innocent, all Appearances were again&s;t us. My undre&s;s, the <HI>Di&s;habilie</HI> of the Bed, the Door &s;hut upon us, and my refu|&s;al to let her enter: So that happen what wou'd

for his Sake, I was re&s;olved his Si&s;ter &s;hou'd not &s;ee him, who mo&s;t diligently kept Centry in the Dining-Room, to watch who &s;hou'd come out. I ran the Hazard and Scandal of being &s;u&s;pected with any other rather than being con|firm'd with him! She goes down to the Ser|vants, to enquire who was with me, they tell her none but her Brother, who was come in two Moments before her. She return'd again to her po&s;t in the Dining-Room, having not &s;o far lo&s;t her re&s;pect to attempt my Chamber Door; tho' as I told you the Key was on the out&s;ide. I I was at my wits end for Invention, and wou'd have him get out of my Dre&s;&s;ing-room-Window upon the Leads, that an&s;wer'd to a Window in another part of the Hou&s;e, and which by chance was then open; from whence he might de&s;cend the back Stairs, and po&s;&s;ibly get off un&s;een. He objected &s;ome Men that were working in the next Neighbours Yard: I told him in a Ca&s;e like that, &s;omething mu&s;t be hazarded. And there|fore removing with Expedition, the Gla&s;s and Toylet, that was &s;pread upon a Table under that Window; he &s;hot in a Moment from one to the other, and good Fortune favouring him, got down the Stairs, and through the Hou&s;e without any of their People &s;eeing him! This was a Lucky Conveyance, &s;ucce&s;sful Leger|demain. And I recovering my Fright, cou'd not cho&s;e but laugh at the &s;ick Lady upon Duty; &s;he &s;tir'd not from her Po&s;t, (I wonder how her Patience cou'd hold from interrupting us;) till after three Hours, (I calling for Candles) She ask'd the Servant who brought 'em, who was with me? And &s;he an&s;wering no body: You mu&s;t imagine what &s;he cou'd think. She had &s;et one Centry at the Street Door, which how they e&s;caped &s;eeing <HI>Worthy</HI> go out I can't

imagine, her &s;elf had been upon the watch above; I had told her there was a Gentleman in the Chamber with me; one Maid &s;ays 'tis her Bro|ther, and &s;oon after another tells her there was no body there. My apparent Confu&s;ion, and Di&s;|habily: All the&s;e were what confounded even her cunning. I believe till that Minute, &s;he &s;u&s;pected not that her Brother had di&s;cover'd to me his Love, but the Appearances were now Strong; and &s;he imagin'd us, to be really Criminal. Why &s;hou'd I of a &s;udden be &s;o undre&s;t? Why &s;hut up alone with her Brother, where &s;he was re|fu&s;ed enterance? Why &s;o confus'd? The&s;e were indeed circum&s;tantial Evidences: But what cou'd I have &s;aid had &s;he enter'd, and found us as at fir&s;t? It wou'd have certainly condemn'd us; and get|ting him off &s;o was all that was left for us to do; as making the be&s;t of a bad Market. 'Twas at wor&s;t a moot point, whether he was with me or no. Politick Mrs. <HI>Woudbe</HI> &s;aid nothing to her Brother, or me, but kept clo&s;e, as well as <HI>Abigal,</HI> to their watch. We had not time to &s;peak together for above a Week after.

My Thoughts too eagerly pre&s;s upon one another, and &s;trive which &s;hall tell you fir&s;t, how much I Love. To de&s;cribe your Bright Charms, is too great an Attempt for my weak Genius; I dare only &s;ay, I feel the Effect, in Extacy and Rapture!

<P>Oh Incon&s;tancy: but why that thought? What need have I to fear? Have not I receiv'd marks of &s;pecial Favour? But 'tis a Woman: Yet the be&s;t of all her Sex; all Truth, and Goodne&s;s! Ay but humane Na|ture (in all things) Loves change; the highe&s;t Tides produce the lowe&s;t Ebbs.

<P>I was not &s;o much &s;urpris'd as I thought I &s;hou'd have bin, upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion! &s;he &s;aid, &s;he cou'd not believe what &s;he had been told, had not her own Ears convinc'd her as to the Truth of it! &s;he re|counted to me many particular Pa&s;&s;ages, e&s;pecially that, when you (in &s;o much Confu&s;ion) thru&s;t her out of the Room, when you had only a Night-Gown on, and I in the Chamber with you.</P>

<P>I &s;hou'd not have given you the&s;e Letters at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ength, but only to beg your Judgment of my Lover's Sincerity; he was &s;ome time before this about departing from us, upon his own bu&s;ine&s;s, with &s;tupid Mrs. <HI>Abigal</HI> for his Hou&s;e-keeper: I conceive Mrs. <HI>Woudbe</HI> was of u&s;e to him (&s;he go|verning her Husband) in point of Stock, or Part|ner&s;hip, that made him &s;o cautious of di&s;obliging her. She Clo&s;eted him the next day, employing three Hours in railing at me, with the mo&s;t pro|digious, ab&s;urd Abu&s;es, that Envy, or Malice, or the Devil him&s;elf cou'd invent.

I be|lieve indeed he was proof to a great part of it, till indu&s;triou&s;ly Mrs. <HI>Marwoud</HI> (owing me a good Turn, for preventing her a Conque&s;t &s;he had a de&s;ire to) told him, I was a Lady only &s;eek|ing my Diver&s;ions, and in whom <HI>Vanity</HI> &s;o much prevail'd, as to expo&s;e his Letter to her, and then repeated part of what &s;he had cunningly read over my Shoulder: He per&s;i&s;ted in his denial, that he had never writ to me any; but when next we met, I found his Eyes declin'd me; and no longer animated by tho&s;e bewitching, &s;oftning Glances, that &s;weetned all the Cruelties of For|tune, and which Love of me fir&s;t taught; I pur&s;u'd 'em, but they were lo&s;t to me; I found time to ask the Cau&s;e of the Change: He an&s;wer'd, I had expos'd his Letter, 'twas what he cou'd not ac|count to him&s;elf for; and therefore mu&s;t begin
<PB N="70" REF="441">
to practi&s;e a difficult Care upon his Heart, &s;ince I did but laugh at him. I had not lei&s;ure to an|&s;wer, but upon Paper endeavour'd to convince him how the Matter hapned: This gave me more pain than I can expre&s;s. If they cou'd &s;ucceed in &s;uch common Arts, of making a mi&s;|under&s;tanding between us, 'twas in vain for me to expect the pro&s;pect of any happine&s;s. I &s;uf|fer'd more real angui&s;h by his fal&s;e di&s;plea&s;ure than I can de&s;cribe. My Letter wrought &s;o far upon him, that at the next Meeting I found the kindling Fire returning to his Eyes; and when, upon the fir&s;t opportunity, he caught me in his Arms to ki&s;s me, I felt the &s;ame Ea&s;e, the &s;ame Relea&s;e from Pain, as a Writch took from the Rack; or from that more exqui&s;ite Torture, the Rack of Nature; the Ea&s;e a Woman feels, re|leas'd from <HI>Mother-pains:</HI> He &s;aid he had in vain &s;trove for his Cure; the more he &s;trove, the har|der it was to conquer.
