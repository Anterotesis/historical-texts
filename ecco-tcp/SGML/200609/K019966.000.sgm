<HEAD>A
LETTER
TO THE
PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I pre&s;umed to write to
my countrymen la&s;t year, to
rou&s;e their &s;pirit again&s;t Mr. <HI>Fox's
Ea&s;t-India bill,</HI> I had the happine&s;s
to find my letter received not only
with indulgence, but with a generous
warmth of heart which I can never
forget, but to the late&s;t moment of
my life &s;hall mo&s;t gratefully remem|ber.
The fire of loyalty was kindled.
It flew through our counties and our
<PB N="2" REF="6">
boroughs. The King was addre&s;&s;ed:
the con&s;titution was &s;aved. I was
proud to have been able thus <HI>ciere
viros;</HI> prouder &s;till than of receiving
the applau&s;e of the <HI>mini&s;ter of the</HI>
CROWN, which he was plea&s;ed to con|vey
to me in a very hand&s;ome letter;
upon which, however, I &s;et a high
value, con&s;idering not only the mi|ni&s;ter,
but the man; and accordingly
it &s;hall be pre&s;erved in the archives
of my family.</P>
<P>I now feel my&s;elf called upon to
to write to them again, upon a &s;ub|ject
of le&s;s magnitude indeed, but of
mo&s;t intere&s;ting concern. The crown
is not in danger every day: GOD for|bid
it &s;hould.</P>
<Q><L>As if Misfortune made the throne her &s;eat,</L>
<L>And none could be unhappy but the great.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7">
But what is the crown without &s;ub|jects?
and what are &s;ubjects without
a good admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice? A
rage for <HI>innovation</HI> has gone forth;
and that rage, &s;econded by avarice
and inordinate love of power, in diffe|rent
parties, according to their dif|ferent
intere&s;ts, hath lately threatened,
and &s;till threatens, us with a violent
&s;hock to our civil judicature, by re|ducing
the number of the lords of
&s;e&s;&s;ion from fifteen to ten, that ten
may have larger &s;alaries. This "comes
home to our bu&s;ine&s;s and bo&s;oms." It
is a very &s;erious alarm indeed. As to
the barons of Exchequer, I &s;hall &s;ay
nothing: It is but a modern court;
and we are told a per&s;on of high of|fice
in the law &s;aid, they were not &s;o
much judges as revenue officers.
<PB N="4" REF="8">
But the <HI>Court of Se&s;&s;ion</HI> has a va&s;t juri&s;|diction.
It was formed by James V.
of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1532, after the mo|del
of the <HI>Parliament of Paris.</HI> It
con&s;i&s;ted originally of &s;even church|men,
&s;even laymen, and a prelate as
pre&s;ident. This was altered. They
are now all laymen; and none can
be appointed but who have been five
years advocates or principal clerks of
court, or ten years clerks to his ma|je&s;ty's
&s;ignet; but advocates are almo&s;t
always appointed. Their gowns are
of purple cloth and crim&s;on velvet,
very gracefully di&s;po&s;ed, and they &s;till
retain the &s;acerdotal badge of a cawl
or pouch, which hangs on their
&s;houlders, as a part of the gown, like
that of the capuchins. Its juri&s;dic|tion
is not only &s;upreme, in Scotland,
<PB N="5" REF="9">
over all cau&s;es civil and con&s;i&s;torial,
(that is to &s;ay, cau&s;es of the nature of
the eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es in England,
with this amazing difference, that
they have a power to give a &s;entence
of divorce equivalent to an act of
parliament) but has al&s;o a con&s;ider|able
extent in criminal ca&s;es. And
let me add, that it has acquired a
kind of undefined arbitrary juri&s;dic|tion,
called its <HI>nobile officium,</HI> for a
full and bold account of which I re|fer
you to Dr. <HI>Gilbert Stuart.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but complain of the &s;ecret
and &s;udden mode of framing and
bringing forward this momentous
bill.&mdash;What! &s;hall the &s;upreme civil
court of a country be dimini&s;hed one
third?&mdash;Shall an e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;anc|tified
<PB N="6" REF="10">
by the acquie&s;cence of ages, be
pulled to pieces without any commu|nication
whatever with the &s;ubjects of
that country, high or low; nay,
without ever con&s;ulting the bar, the
<HI>faculty</HI> of <HI>advocates,</HI> that learned body
who are guardians of the law&mdash;<HI>anti&s;|tites
ju&s;titiae.</HI> But <HI>&s;candal</HI> &s;ays, Mr.
<HI>Henry Dundas</HI> has been applied to
by &s;ome of the judges, who, after
fea&s;ting at <HI>Bayll's</HI> French tavern, and
rai&s;ing their &s;pirits high with wine,
have formed the lofty wi&s;h of reve|rently
paying their court to <HI>Regina
Pecunia;</HI>&mdash;and Mr. <HI>Henry Dundas</HI>
(&s;ometimes called <HI>Harry the Ninth</HI>)
very willing to oblige tho&s;e &s;enators,
and make them his devoted humble
&s;ervants, has nodded a&s;&s;ent. <HI>Egre|giam
&s;ane loudem, et &s;polia ampla re|fertis.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="11">
But Mr. Dundas, not being
<HI>&s;ure</HI> that the people of Scotland are
yet <HI>entirely tame,</HI> has been too wi&s;e
to commit <HI>him&s;elf</HI> in this de&s;perate
bu&s;ine&s;s, but has only given in&s;truc|tions;
and then Mr. <HI>Ilay Campbell,</HI>
the pre&s;ent lord advocate of Scotland,
whom his brethren did the honour to
elect their vice dean, ri&s;es in the hou&s;e
of commons with this &s;ame pretty
little bill, cut and dry, and thinks
he may at once kill his five men, and
in triumph call out, "Off with their
heads!"&mdash;So much for <HI>Lords of
Se&s;&s;ion.</HI> But let him beware! he will
find them "ri&s;e with ga&s;hes on their
crowns, to pu&s;h him, and others too,
perhaps, from their &s;tools." Like the
vi&s;ion in Mr. <HI>Glover's</HI> celebrated bal|lad
of <HI>Ho&s;ier's Gho&s;t,</HI> "A &s;ad troop
<PB N="8" REF="12">
will appear, all &s;hrowded in dreary
robes, as winding &s;heets, and frown|ing
on a ho&s;tile band."</P>
<P>But indeed, indeed, our country is
at a mi&s;erable ebb, when its great and
good families are totally indifferent
about every public concern, and have
&s;o little &s;pirit, even as to their private
concerns, that they never advance,
like men, to the fountain head of go|vernment,
but indolently or timidly
&s;uffer all to be done by &s;ome per&s;on or
other who for the time is brought for|ward,
or who puts him&s;elf forward,
as a <HI>mini&s;ter for Scotland.</HI> They are
afraid to let their <HI>natural voice</HI> be
heard by admini&s;tration, but mu&s;t
convey their wi&s;hes through a &s;peak|ing
trumpet, which, I will tell them,
<PB N="9" REF="13">
may be pointed high or low, as he
who holds it may think proper. But
if the Stuarts, the Hamiltons, the
Er&s;kines, the Craufurds, the Mont|gomeries,
the Dougla&s;es, the Grahams,
the Somervilles, the Cathcarts, the
Kennedies, in &s;hort, all the men of
blood and of property, who ought to
be men of con&s;equence, hang back,
are we to be &s;urprized that admini|&s;tration
appoints a <HI>locum tenens,</HI> an
agent, or by whatever name he may
be called; or that &s;ome able and ar|dent
politician takes their place. I
remember <HI>Archibald</HI> duke of <HI>Argyll</HI>
&mdash;I remember <HI>Stuart Mackenzie</HI>&mdash;I
remember <HI>Gilmour,</HI> all in their turn,
<HI>bowed</HI> to, and bringing the people
of Scotland to St. James's and the
Trea&s;ury, as a &s;ale&s;man drives black
<PB N="10" REF="14">
cattle to Smithfield. Poor dumb
bea&s;ts! why &s;hould they not walk up
them&s;elves, and bellow as they may
incline?</P>
<Q><L>I'll bellow out for Rome, and for my country,</L>
<L>And mouth at Cae&s;ar till I &s;hake the Senate.</L></Q>
<P>Then came Mr. <HI>Henry Dundas,</HI>
who has made a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure
at more markets than one&mdash;whether
at <HI>Oxford</HI> market with Lord <HI>North,</HI>
or <HI>Leadenhall</HI> market with Mr. <HI>Pitt.</HI></P>
<P>There was a time when we were
flattered there was to be no monopoly
&mdash;when that TITUS, that <HI>Deliciae hu|mani
generis,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Portland</HI>
(I give his Grace as Mr. Burke gave
him me, not having the good fortune
to be known to him) when <HI>He</HI> pre|&s;ided.
&mdash;O, then! all was to go well
<PB N="11" REF="15">
with Scotland!&mdash;There was to be no
go-between&mdash;nobody to keep back
the individuals of that di&s;tant part of
the i&s;land from fairly a&s;&s;erting their
preten&s;ions, whether from birth,
wealth, or merit. But, alas! we &s;oon
found there was only a <HI>change of
Dunda&s;es.</HI> In&s;tead of Mr. <HI>Henry
Dundas,</HI> we got Sir <HI>Thomas Dundas;</HI>
and now we have Mr. <HI>Henry Dundas</HI>
again.</P>
<P>Mr. Dundas is of a great law race.
The family of <HI>Arni&s;ton</HI> has for four
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations been judges in
our &s;upreme civil court, and for the&s;e
two la&s;t been at the head of it as
Pre&s;ident.&mdash;A very extraordinary in|&s;tance,
in modern times, where it can
be &s;aid, <HI>per fa&s;ces numerat avos.</HI>
Why then, O why! Mr. Dundas,
<PB N="12" REF="16">
&s;hould <HI>you</HI> attempt to injure this an|cient
in&s;titution? Are you not afraid
that the &s;hades of your ance&s;tors may
di&s;turb your pillow? "Be not too
bold," I intreat you! There are
&s;ome things which we will bear, and
&s;ome things which we will <HI>not</HI> bear.
Think, O think of
<Q>"Vaulting Ambition, which o'erleaps it&s;elf!"</Q>
Be&s;ides, Sir, you are the Dean of the
Faculty of Advocates. We have placed
you in the chair where LOCKHART
&s;at: we expect you will not betray
us.</P>
<P>But, that I may now &s;peak to my
countrymen in plain, and, I flatter
my&s;elf, convincing argument, let us
con&s;ider the peculiar form and con|&s;titution
of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion. It
<PB N="13" REF="17">
will hardly be believed, in <HI>England,</HI>
that we have no juries in civil cau&s;es;
&s;till more &s;trange will it &s;eem, that
we once had that ine&s;timable privi|lege,
and lo&s;t it&mdash;nobody can tell how.
But Lord <HI>Kames</HI> has proved it.&mdash;That
a country &s;hould, in the progre&s;s of
civilization in every other re&s;pect, be|come
more barbarous in its executive
juri&s;prudence, is a wonderful and a
di&s;graceful phaenomenon. Nay, we
have no grand jury in Scotland. There
is no &s;uch thing as finding a bill by
the country: all criminal pro&s;ecutions
are by <HI>information</HI> of the fir&s;t crown
lawyer, or by immediate indictment
at the &s;uit of private per&s;ons, with his
concurrence; &s;o that there is neither
the &s;ecurity again&s;t unju&s;t pro&s;ecutions
which the verdict of our peers would
<PB N="14" REF="18">
afford, nor is there a certainty that
crimes which <HI>ought</HI> to be pro&s;ecuted
<HI>will</HI> be pro&s;ecuted. All is left to the
will and plea&s;ure of <HI>His Maje&s;ty's Ad|vocate,</HI>
the Attorney-General of Scot|land,
that anomalous per&s;onage who&s;e
<HI>&s;tatus</HI> puzzles the Hou&s;e of Commons;
who is a <HI>lord,</HI> but yet not <HI>noble,</HI> and
to-morrow may de&s;cend to be only
the honourable, or a&s;cend to be the
right honourable, <HI>gentleman.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Plac'd on this i&s;thmus of a middle &s;tate,</L>
<L>A being darkly wi&s;e, and rudely great.</L></Q>
<P>The Lord Advocate of Scotland
has the whole power of a grand jury
in his per&s;on. The fat Mr. <HI>Edward
Bright,</HI> of Malden, who&s;e print is in
all our inns to amu&s;e the weary tra|veller,
is nothing to the <HI>learned lord.</HI>
&mdash;<HI>He</HI> could button &s;even men in his
<PB N="15" REF="19">
wai&s;tcoat; but the learned lord com|prehends
hundreds: the grand juries
of thirty counties are packed within
his little circumference.</P>
<P>The Court of Se&s;&s;ion then is not
only a body of <HI>judges,</HI> but, like the
Parliament of Paris, it is a &s;tanding
<HI>jury</HI> for all Scotland. And will it
be &s;eriou&s;ly maintained, that <HI>fifteen</HI> is
too large a number, when that is con|&s;idered?
My amiable and honourable
friend <HI>Demp&s;ter,</HI> that <HI>rara avis</HI> of
the Scotti&s;h breed, who has &s;at in
parliament almo&s;t as long as our pre|&s;ent
mo&s;t gracious Sovereign has &s;at
upon the throne, and has &s;hewn him|&s;elf
uniformly independent, uniformly
benevolent, when I talked to him
upon this &s;ubject, exclaimed, <Q>Fif|teen
<PB N="16" REF="20">
too few! I would rather have
fifty. They talk of there being
only twelve judges in England: I
&s;ay there are twenty thou&s;and&mdash;the
juries&mdash;by whom almo&s;t every
thing is decided; and our fifteen
Lords of Se&s;&s;ion are all we have
for a jury in civil cau&s;es.</Q>&mdash;Nobly
&s;aid! There <HI>are</HI> twenty thou&s;and
judges in England&mdash;<HI>judges of law as
well as of fact</HI>&mdash;and I hope in GOD
there ever &s;hall be, notwith&s;tanding
all that the old Conjuror or any of
his pupils can do. While a <HI>Loft</HI> and
a <HI>Towers</HI> can write, and a <HI>Lee</HI> and
an <HI>Er&s;kine</HI> plead, that &s;acred palla|dium
will be pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>If the Briti&s;h Parliament will give
us a grand jury, and juries in civil
<PB N="17" REF="21">
cau&s;es (for both of which, if I am
ever thought worthy of being &s;ent
into the Hou&s;e of Commons as an
independent gentleman, I &s;hall cer|tainly
move for leave to bring in a
bill) I will an&s;wer for it that the
people of Scotland (when deliberately
con&s;ulted&mdash;as they ought to be, in
ju&s;tice, in propriety, and in common
decency) will cheerfully agree to have
the number of the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion
dimini&s;hed, becau&s;e they would <HI>then</HI>
have &s;omething better than their an|cient
ari&s;tocratical court. And with
exultation I can tell, that, &s;o far as
the people of Scotland <HI>can</HI>&mdash;in the
limited privilege of Juries which they
have&mdash;they do now exerci&s;e their
con&s;titutional right in its full extent.
We have a <HI>Smellie,</HI> who has, with a
<PB N="18" REF="22">
calm but an undaunted &s;pirit, pointed
it out to his fellow citizens in a well
written di&s;cour&s;e; and a few months
ago <HI>William Spence,</HI> a young matro&s;s,
for whom I was coun&s;el, was indicted
by the Lord Advocate for felonious
<HI>fire-rai&s;ing.</HI> He was pro&s;ecuted by
his lord&s;hip in per&s;on, with all his
addre&s;s; and the Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk,
the Vice Pre&s;ident, of the High
Court of Ju&s;ticiary, gave a charge,
with all his his ability, to find him
guilty. But a re&s;pectable jury ac|quitted
him; and, <HI>as I hope for
mercy from the Judge of all the earth,</HI>
had I been one of their number, I
&s;hould have been clear to join in the
verdict. I will give up my own
opinion to no human authority.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="23">
In the pre&s;ent form and con&s;titu|tion
of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, there
is occa&s;ion for at lea&s;t the full number
of judges which were at fir&s;t ap|pointed,
and which has remained un|dimini&s;hed
now for <HI>two hundred and
fifty three years.</HI> It is remarkable
that when James V. in&s;tituted the
court, the number of the judges was
thought &s;mall. Take the words of
<BIBL><HI>Buchanan Hi&s;t.</HI> lib. 14. cap. 32.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Joannes Dux Albinus, a pontifice
Romano impetravit, ut &s;umma pe|cuniae
annua quanta &s;atis e&s;&s;et ad</HI>
paucorum <HI>judicum &s;alarium &s;olven|dum
imperaretur eccle&s;ia&s;tico ordini
univer&s;o, a &s;inguli&s;que pro mod&ograve;,
cen&s;us exigeretur.</HI></Q> He tells us, it
was difficult to obtain money for &s;a|laries
even to tho&s;e <HI>few;</HI> &s;o much
<PB N="20" REF="24">
&s;tronger <HI>then</HI> too was the love of mo|ney
than the love of ju&s;tice&mdash;and he
&s;ternly delivers his opinion that the
in&s;titution did not produce the good
that was expected from it: <Q><HI>Omnium
civium bona</HI> quindecim <HI>hominum
arbitrio &s;unt commi&s;&s;a, quibus et
perpetua e&s;t pote&s;tas, et imperium
plane tyrannicum.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>perpetua pote&s;tas</HI> is the griev|ance
of a <HI>&s;tanding jury;</HI> and the <HI>im|perium
plane tyrannicum</HI> mu&s;t, in the
nature of things, re&s;ide in a body of
men who po&s;&s;e&s;s at once the province
of judge and of jury; nay of common
law judges and equity judges; who
are both King's Bench and Chancery,
and who&s;e deci&s;ions therefore may be a
compound of law and of fact and of
<PB N="21" REF="25">
equity, as its members may be dif|ferently
moved.</P>
<P>It is this which makes it of infinite
con&s;equence to us to pre&s;erve all the
judges we have, as long as the court
retains the &s;ame con&s;titution; for it
has been found in practice, that,
notwith&s;tanding the &s;taggering objec|tions
to it in theory, this &s;ame court
of fifteen has been &s;o balanced and
mixed, and tempered and mellowed,
by the workings of various qualities,
in the cour&s;e of time, that upon the
whole it has done very well.</P>
<P>There may, to be &s;ure, come a
DOUGLAS CAUSE, which is too va&s;t an
object for the throw of &s;uch a com|plicated
die. <HI>Non no&s;trum e&s;t tantas
componere lites.</HI> That is not much;
<PB N="22" REF="26">
becau&s;e for great cau&s;es we have an
appeal to that augu&s;t tribunal, the
Hou&s;e of Lords. But, as the ex|pence
of an appeal is more than the
value of almo&s;t every cau&s;e that the
court of &s;e&s;&s;ion decides, the right of
appeal is nothing to the greate&s;t
number of our &s;uitors.&mdash;We are
therefore concerned that <HI>Innovation</HI>
&s;hould be prevented, as we may fear,
but cannot fore&s;ee its effects, and as
the <HI>imperium</HI> of the court would be
&s;till more <HI>tyrannicum</HI> in ten than in
fifteen, as &s;pirits have more force as
they are more compre&s;&s;ed by di&s;tilla|tion.</P>
<P>Our ance&s;tors took care to have it
&s;olemnly &s;tipulated in the 19<HI>th article
of the Union,</HI> <Q>That the <HI>Court of
<PB N="23" REF="27">
Se&s;&s;ion,</HI> or College of Ju&s;tice, do,
after the Union, and notwith&s;tand|ing
thereof, <HI>remain in all time
coming,</HI> within Scotland, <HI>as it is
now con&s;tituted</HI> by the laws of that
kingdom, and with the &s;ame au|thority
and privileges as before the
Union, &s;ubject neverthele&s;s to &s;uch
<HI>regulations, for the better admini|&s;tration
of Ju&s;tice,</HI> as &s;hall be made
by the Parliament of Great-Britain.</Q></P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, think you, by any
artifice of words, by any little quirk
of any &s;ort, to explain away this ar|ticle,
and to maintain that the ex|cepted
power to <HI>make regulations for
the better admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice,</HI> in a
<HI>court</HI> which is to <HI>remain in all time
coming as now con&s;tituted,</HI> &s;hall be
<PB N="24" REF="28">
under&s;tood to give a licence to de&s;troy
that very court it&s;elf, by <HI>changing</HI> its
<HI>con&s;titution?</HI> Is a court of <HI>ten</HI> the
&s;ame with a court of <HI>fifteen?</HI> Is a <HI>two-legged</HI>
animal the &s;ame with a <HI>four-legged</HI>
animal? I know nobody who
will gravely defend that propo&s;ition,
except one grote&s;que 'philo&s;opher,
whom ludicrous <HI>fable</HI> repre&s;ents as
going about avowing his hunger, and
wagging his tail, fain to become can|nibal,
and eat his decea&s;ed brethren.
It is <HI>clear,</HI> that the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> mu&s;t be
pre&s;erved, though the <HI>accidents</HI> may
be varied. The <HI>Court of Se&s;&s;ion,</HI> the
<HI>Quindecem Homines,</HI> mu&s;t remain,
unle&s;s <HI>by con&s;ent of the people of Scot|land
them&s;elves,</HI> though the proceed|ings
of the court, the modes of admi|ni&s;trating
ju&s;tice by tho&s;e <HI>fifteen,</HI> may
<PB N="25" REF="29">
be regulated occa&s;ionally, as the Bri|ti&s;h
Parliament, in its great wi&s;dom,
&s;hall &s;ee fit. If any man can enter|tain

ju&s;t upon the &s;ame ground of &s;ecurity
<PB N="26" REF="30">
that the Court of Se&s;&s;ion does. No
doubt it may be aboli&s;hed by univer|&s;al
con&s;ent, or by con&s;ent of a majo|rity

is my firm opinion of the import of
the articles of the Union. But the

that, if the articles of Union &s;hould

not <HI>you</HI> that can prevent it. You are
too few. It is to <HI>Scotland</HI> you owe
your &s;afety. Government at pre&s;ent
<HI>dare</HI> not equalize the land-tax. <HI>Scot|land</HI>
would ri&s;e to a man, and a&s;&s;ert
the articles of the Union. But the

<Q><L>"There the bright flame was &s;hot through Marchmont's foul!"</L></Q></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent attempt puts me in
mind of one of the many good &s;tories
<PB N="32" REF="36">
which I have heard my father tell.&mdash;
An Earl of <HI>Seaforth</HI> took it into his
head that he would pull down <HI>Bran</HI>
ca&s;tle, the ancient &s;eat of his family.
The <HI>clan</HI> was alarmed. The <HI>caper|fey</HI>
(the deer's head, the cre&s;t of the
Mackenzie's) was di&s;played. The
brave <HI>Mackenzies</HI> took fire, a&s;&s;embled,
and came to him in a body. <Q>My
lord, this &s;hall not be! Wi&s;er men
than you built this ca&s;tle! You
&s;hall not demoli&s;h it!</Q>&mdash;<HI>There</HI> was
the true &s;pirit of clan&s;hip: not a
&s;lavi&s;h &s;ubjection to an individual;
but a voluntary attachment to their
patriarchal father and lord&mdash;to the fa|mily
&mdash;to the throne.</P>
<P>I abhor annihilation&mdash;and five of
our judges &s;hall not peri&s;h, if I can
<PB N="33" REF="37">
prevent it.&mdash;What, in the name of
goodne&s;s, is the motive to this violent
mea&s;ure? Does the country com|plain
that there are too many judges?
No.&mdash;Do the judges them&s;elves
complain? I tru&s;t, No.&mdash;For what,
I pray you, is the Court of Se&s;&s;ion?
Why, it is an aggregate of <HI>fourteen</HI>
&s;eparate and di&s;tinct &s;ubordinate
courts, and one Court of Appeal.
There are fourteen <HI>ordinary lords:</HI>
Each of the&s;e has his own roll of
cau&s;es, in one half of which his
judgement is allowed to be final.
The Court of Appeal is the whole
body of tho&s;e <HI>Lord Ordinaries,</HI> with
the Lord Pre&s;ident at their head;
and this Court of Appeal &s;its five
days in the week to review judgments
of the <HI>Ordinaries.</HI>&mdash;Now let us con|&s;ider
<PB N="34" REF="38">
how bu&s;ine&s;s is done in this
court, or, more properly &s;peaking,
in the&s;e courts. It is done chiefly in
writing, and mo&s;t voluminous writing
it is: there are <HI>minutes, repre&s;enta|tions,
an&s;wers, replies, duplies, triplies,
memorials hinc inde&mdash;cum multis aliis,
que nunc</HI> per&s;cribere <HI>longum e&s;t;</HI> &s;o
that each <HI>proce&s;s</HI> (as the papers in a
&s;uit are called) makes a thick bundle,
which is carried to the judge's hou&s;e;
and this he mu&s;t peru&s;e, and after|wards
put his <HI>interlocutor</HI> upon it in
writing, and authenticate it by his
&s;ub&s;cription. Now I <HI>know,</HI> and every
man acquainted with the court knows,
and <HI>it can be proved by all the mem|bers
of the College of Ju&s;tice,</HI> that it
is with the utmo&s;t difficulty that even
the fourteen judges whom we have,
<PB N="35" REF="39">
can get through the bu&s;ine&s;s with
rea&s;onable di&s;patch. How is it po&s;|&s;ible
then that it can be done by a
third fewer people, be they ever &s;o
laborious? Nine Dukes of <HI>Richmond</HI>
could not do it.</P>
<P>I could &s;ee &s;ome meaning in dimi|ni&s;hing
the <HI>Court of Review,</HI> and let|ting
only the <HI>ten</HI> &s;enior judges, or
perhaps the <HI>five</HI> &s;enior judges, &s;it in
the <HI>Inner Hou&s;e,</HI> that the Court of
Review might move quicker, by be|ing
le&s;s unwieldy, and the other
judges might have more time to ripen
and decide cau&s;es in the fir&s;t in&s;tance,
which is the mo&s;t laborious part of
the bu&s;ine&s;s. <HI>That</HI> I could under|&s;tand,
as coming within the power
conceded, in the articles of Union, to
<PB N="36" REF="40">
make <HI>regulations.</HI> But to make <Q>the
labourers few, when the harve&s;t
truly is great,</Q> &s;eems to me to be
very &s;trange policy.</P>
<P>And here I have an <HI>argumentum
ad homines.</HI> I <HI>will not believe</HI> that
the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion them&s;elves are &s;o
uncon&s;cientious as to approve of this
mea&s;ure, though <HI>Rumour,</HI> with all
her tongues, has wantonly &s;aid they
are for it. My argument is this:&mdash;
There is not one of them who has
not, again and again, &s;aid, what I
have ju&s;t now &s;tated, that the duty
of his office is very great, and that in
&s;e&s;&s;ion-time he is quite harra&s;&s;ed, he
has &s;o much to do.&mdash;Will they then
undertake to do more, that they may
get a little more money? I hope not.
<PB N="37" REF="41">
As it mu&s;t be <HI>&s;ure</HI> that they are <HI>per|fectly
innocent</HI> of &s;o heavy a charge, I
may put it in &s;trong words&mdash;<Q>Either
they <HI>have</HI> been <HI>liars;</HI> or, They
<HI>mean</HI> to be <HI>cheats.</HI></Q> That is the in|famous
charge which their approba|tion
of le&s;&s;ening their number, with|out
le&s;&s;ening or &s;hortening the bu&s;ine&s;s
of the court, would involve.&mdash;I beg
ten thou&s;and pardons for even utter|ing
&s;uch coar&s;e epithets; but my in|dignation
is rou&s;ed, that any creature
whatever &s;hould have the audacity
to impute to the judges of my coun|try
&s;o abominable an alternative.</P>
<P><HI>Quid non mortalia pectora cogis auri
&s;acra fames?</HI> is an exclamation which
keeps pace with mankind, from age
to age. But, &s;urely, we ought to
<PB N="38" REF="42">
&s;uppo&s;e judges have learnt better
things, and have extirpated from
their hallowed brea&s;ts, <Q><HI>the root of
all evil.</HI></Q>&mdash;How injurious is it to
imagine they will be like &s;ome impu|dent
&s;luts, who, for more wages,
will undertake to be both cookmaid
and chambermaid&mdash;<HI>Delicate coalition!</HI>
&mdash;The Lords of Se&s;&s;ion are, or &s;hould
be, Gentlemen. Shall we make them
a parcel of <HI>Scrubs?</HI>&mdash;<Q>Of a Monday I
drive the coach; of a Tue&s;day I drive
the plough; on a Wedne&s;day I follow
the hounds; a Thur&s;day I dun the

on Saturday I draw warrants; and
a Sunday I draw beer.</Q></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e it &s;hould be thought right
to increa&s;e the &s;alaries of the Lords of
<PB N="39" REF="43">
Se&s;&s;ion; is there no way of doing it
but making two-thirds of them devour
the re&s;t, like Pharaoh's lean and fat
kine? Is the &s;tate &s;o poor, that we
mu&s;t adopt a mea&s;ure &s;imilar to the
barbarous permi&s;&s;ion in China and
Otaheite, to murder their children,
le&s;t they &s;hould not have food
enough? Six thou&s;and pounds a
year would make them up &pound;1000
each; and cannot that mi&s;erable &s;um
be &s;pared off &s;ome corner of the &s;ine|cure
e&s;tabli&s;hment? I per&s;uade my|&s;elf
that the people of Scotland them|&s;elves
would &s;ubmit to a <HI>cen&s;us,</HI> in
order to ran&s;om their court. If the
Judges are poor, let them hold out
<HI>the Mendicant pouch,</HI> and receive our
<HI>benevolence!</HI> I, for one, would cheer|fully
pay my <HI>quota,</HI> rather than &s;uffer
<PB N="40" REF="44">
&s;o dangerous an amputation to be
botchingly performed upon our old
judicial body.</P>
<P>But is it quite clear that there
&s;hould be an augmentation of their
&s;alaries? The Lord Pre&s;ident has
already &pound;1400 a year: every Ordinary
Lord has better than <HI>&s;ix hundred gui|neas;</HI>
and &s;ix of their number are al&s;o
Lords of Ju&s;ticiary, of whom the
Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk has &pound;400 a year,
and each of the other five has &pound;200
a year. Be&s;ides, every one of tho&s;e
&s;ix is allowed &pound;300 a year for circuit
expences; and now that they have
obtained an act of Parliament, allow|ing
them to &s;tay only three days at
each a&s;&s;ize-town in&s;tead of &s;ix, as they
were formerly obliged to do (<HI>while the
<PB N="41" REF="45">
&s;ame allowance for expences is quietly
continued)</HI> they have, upon my word,
very comfortable provi&s;ions. The
Ju&s;ticiary gown is an excellent object
of ambition, and an encouragement
for laudable exertion to the Ordinary
Lords. But even without that, they
have a very decent premium from the
&s;tate, and may live very well in <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
as judges &s;hould live; <Q>not in
rioting and drunkenne&s;s,</Q> indeed,
but in grave ab&s;traction, as becomes
their office. Dr. <HI>South's</HI> pulpit joke,
upon the wages of &s;in being death&mdash;
<Q>Poor wages, that a man cannot live
by</Q>&mdash;will not, in my opinion, ap|ply
to <HI>all</HI> offices. The &s;tate, in many
ca&s;es, is only to help a man to live;
not wholly to &s;upport him. The
&s;tate &s;hould enable him fully to de|fray
<PB N="42" REF="46">
the additional expence occa&s;ioned
by the office which he holds: but he
is a hungry hound indeed, who comes
into an office of re&s;pect and experi|ence,
&s;uch as that of a judge, with
nothing at all of his own, neither fa|mily
e&s;tate, nor fortune acquired by
practice. I own I &s;hould think a
man in &s;uch circum&s;tances ought not
to be made a judge: either his birth
mu&s;t be mean&mdash;his abilities &s;mall&mdash;
or his conduct imprudent.</P>
<P>Were there a difficulty to find men
of merit willing to be made Lords of
Se&s;&s;ion, by rea&s;on of the &s;alary being
too &s;mall, I could under&s;tand this
<HI>procru&s;tian</HI> expedient: but let us at
lea&s;t wait till that is the ca&s;e, which,
well Mr. <HI>Dundas</HI> knows, it is not as
<PB N="43" REF="47">
yet, by any means. Will he tell me
that the &s;alary of that office is not
&s;ufficiently con&s;iderable, for which
Mr. <HI>Alexander Gordon,</HI> brother to the
Earl of Aberdeen, uncle to the Duke
of Gordon, and a man of good under|&s;tanding,
experience, and integrity,
&s;olicited for years, and&mdash;<HI>pudet haec

&s;oliciting &s;till, had not a political
wave, in the tempe&s;t of la&s;t year,
thrown him into port.&mdash;An office de|&s;ired
by Mr. <HI>John Maclaurin (filius
Colini fama &s;uper</HI> aethera <HI>noti,</HI> and a

but not promoted. <HI>Laudatur et

<P>I could with plea&s;ure give a long
li&s;t of my de&s;erving brethren. To us,
it is <HI>not fair.</HI> It is <HI>unju&s;t</HI> to le&s;&s;en the
number of prizes after the lottery has
begun drawing; after we, by an ex|pen&s;ive
education, and much time
and labour, have purcha&s;ed our tickets,
in the faith that our chance for a prize
is to be what it ever has been. As
for my&s;elf, I do mo&s;t certainly believe
that I am now writing from pure mo|tives,
becau&s;e I have at pre&s;ent no wi&s;h
for the &s;erious and important office of
a Lord of Se&s;&s;ion. I have a confi|dence
<PB N="45" REF="49">
(perhaps too great a confidence)
in my abilities; and therefore will try
my fortune, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, in
a wider &s;phere. But this I declare,
that though the &s;ituation &s;eems to me
too confined, I never thought the &s;a|lary
too &s;mall.</P>
<P>Let us be cautious of augmenting
the &s;alaries of our judges. Judges,
like men of genius and learning,

in Scotland &s;hould not be too good a
<HI>place,</HI> le&s;t it become altogether an
object of political preferment. We
have already &s;everal noble lords who
are of the Faculty of Advocates, and
who might perhaps conde&s;cend to
take &s;uch a loaf. Lord <HI>Salton</HI> might
think it a <HI>&s;nug thing.</HI> My cou&s;in,
<PB N="46" REF="50">
Lord <HI>Cathcart,</HI> might &s;ee it to be
<HI>better than a regiment.</HI> Lord <HI>Stair</HI>
might <HI>add</HI> it to his <HI>finances.</HI> Lord
<HI>Ca&s;&s;illis</HI> might chu&s;e it by way of
<HI>otium cum dignitate.</HI>&mdash;And the gen|tlemen
whom I have mentioned, with
an <HI>Er&s;kine,</HI> a <HI>Blair,</HI> an <HI>Abercrombie,</HI>
a <HI>Grant,</HI> a <HI>Cullen,</HI> and all the re&s;t
who have honourably borne the heat
of the day, might langui&s;h and die,
without ever obtaining that rank to
which they will in ju&s;tice be entitled.</P>
<P>Take the Scotti&s;h Bench as it is
now endowed&mdash;take it in a pecuniary
view: It is a <HI>tontine</HI> for our &s;ons. In
no country in Europe, but Scotland,
is the profe&s;&s;ion of the law an <HI>etat,</HI> a
rank. Many a gentleman with us
enters advocate merely to have a fea|ther
<PB N="47" REF="51">
in his cap. The prime &s;ociety
of Edinburgh, is lawyers. <HI>They</HI>
give the tone, as, <HI>arbitri elegantiarum,
they</HI> rule the theatre. <HI>They</HI> make
balls for the ladies; and once (I &s;up|po&s;e
to &s;hew the prodigious extent of
their power) they let the nation know
that they could pro&s;cribe even a beau|tiful
Duche&s;s, the very &s;oul of gay fe&s;|tivity.
<HI>Black, law black,</HI> is the com|mon
dre&s;s of the gentlemen of Edin|burgh,
by choice, as at Geneva and
Lucca, by an oeconomical regulation
of the &s;tate, a &s;umptuary law: and
hence, when <HI>Foote</HI> was among&s;t us, he
u&s;ed to call <HI>black</HI> the <HI>Edinburgh hunt.</HI>
It exalts our gentlemen to think they
may be judges, as, by calculation, it

If he can but have the &s;upreme tri|bunal

under&s;tood that the whole <HI>political in|tere&s;t</HI>

the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion; for they a&s;cer|tain
the validity of all the votes,
<PB N="49" REF="53">
whether in our counties or in our
boroughs: and when we afterwards
bring our conte&s;ted elections before a
committee of the Hou&s;e of Commons,
we have the mortification to find that
Mr. <HI>Grenville's</HI> bill is to us, on the
north of the Tweed, as if it were not.
In vain do we plead, in vain do we
pre&s;s upon the committee, the ab&s;urdi|ty,

For though I differ from you, in my

And I am never unmindful of your

But you may tell your friends

this bill&mdash;this odious bill of pains

a man who has vexed me
not a little, by his political &s;ucce&s;s in

<P><PB N="52" REF="56">
Do any of you want to be in|formed

Why Sir <HI>Adam Fergu&s;&s;on, advocate,</HI>
the <HI>late</HI> member for the <HI>county of
Ayr!</HI> Sir Adam Fergu&s;&s;on wrote a
circular letter again&s;t peers interfering
in our county election, and &s;everal
very worthy gentlemen joined the
&s;tandard of <HI>independency,</HI> as they ima|gined,
which he erected. Carrying
them along with him, and yet
"having his peers as well as we,"
he contrived to po&s;&s;e&s;s, for two par|liaments,
the repre&s;entation of Ayr|&s;hire,
by means of <HI>tho&s;e &s;uperiority
votes,</HI> which that county has declared
to be <HI>nominal and fictitious,</HI> while
the REAL INTEREST was unrepre&s;ented.
Sir Adam Fergu&s;&s;on la&s;t year, <HI>as we
are told,</HI> made overtures to the <HI>Earl
<PB N="54" REF="58">
of Eglintoune,</HI> and formed a <HI>coalition</HI>
with his lord&s;hip. That he was <HI>not

is &s;aid</HI> he &s;upports the earl's friend
for one parliament, and the earl is to
make him member next parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the report of this curious agreement bur&s;t upon the county, like a bomb, and &s;tunned men of all parties, I made the following Bell|man's rhimes, to u&s;her in my friend Colonel Hugh Montgomerie as our repre&s;entative:
<LG>
<L>Adam, too long you've kept your &s;eat,</L>
<L>With little for your pains;</L>

<L>Thus Ayr&s;hire yet may pro&s;perous be,</L>

<L>And if <HI>you're</HI> plea&s;ed <HI>our</HI> joy to &s;ee,</L>

</LG>
THE REAL INTEREST.</NOTE>
<PB N="55" REF="59">
&mdash;<HI>if he can.</HI> I have never heard his
lord&s;hip &s;ay that this report is true:
but if it is, the noble earl mu&s;t not
take it ami&s;s, if &s;ome of the be&s;t
friends of his family &s;hould di&s;dain
what they think degrading to him, and
feel obnoxious to them&s;elves. Among&s;t
tho&s;e friends, I my&s;elf am one of the
warme&s;t, both as an enthu&s;ia&s;t for an|cient
feudal attachments, and as having
the honour and happine&s;s to be mar|ried
to his lord&s;hip's relation, a true
<HI>Montgomerie,</HI> whom I e&s;teem, whom
I love, after fifteen years, as on the
day when &s;he gave me her hand.&mdash;
But I have an objection to Sir Adam
Fergu&s;&s;on, on account of a paltry
money que&s;tion, which being now
under the arbitration of three of our
Lords of Se&s;&s;ion, I forbear to exhibit
<PB N="56" REF="60">
it, till the re&s;ult is known.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Mac|adam,</HI>
of <HI>Craigengillan,</HI> as able and
as &s;pirited a man as any in his Ma|je&s;ty's
dominions, and Sir <HI>John
Whitefoord,</HI> who is honour it&s;elf,
both gentlemen of exten&s;ive intere&s;t
in Ayr&s;hire, have al&s;o objections to
him, which they have &s;tated to me,
and will tell any body who thinks it
worth while to a&s;k them.&mdash;In the&s;e
circum&s;tances, the Hou&s;e of Eglin|toune
can hardly expect that the
great county of Ayr, the York&s;hire of
Scotland, will be brought implicitly
to wheel, and vote for &s;ir Adam Fer|gu&s;&s;on,
merely that a bargain, which
&s;hould never have been made, may be
fulfilled. I my&s;elf have rea&s;on to
hope, that many of the real free|holders
of Ayr&s;hire will &s;upport me
<PB N="57" REF="61">
at the election for next parliament,
again&s;t which I have declared my&s;elf
a candidate. Colonel <HI>Montgomerie</HI>
has had the great honour of being
cho&s;en by the real Freeholders. May
I not have it in my turn? <HI>Ed anche
Io &s;on pittore.</HI> By the time this par|liament
is over, he may be content to
be <Q><HI>Vejanius, armis Herculis ad po&s;tem
fixis.</HI></Q>&mdash;I &s;hall certainly &s;tand, upon
the &s;ub&s;tantial intere&s;t of the gentle|men
of landed property; and if, upon
a fair trial, I &s;hould not &s;ucceed in
<Q>that object of ambition, which I
have mo&s;t ardently at heart,</Q> I have
re&s;ources enough to prevent me from
being di&s;contented or fretful. Perhaps
Sir Adam Fergu&s;&s;on may &s;upport me.
Why &s;hould he not? I know of no
objection the honourable baronet can
<PB N="58" REF="62">
have to me, though I am &s;orry that
I have an objection to the honourable
baronet. I have a&s;ked his vote and
intere&s;t by a letter. His an&s;wer has
neither granted nor refu&s;ed my appli|cation.
He waves it on the common
civil ground, that it is too &s;oon to
decide. In the mean time, I &s;hall
endeavour to de&s;erve the &s;upport of
the real freeholders, by exerting my|&s;elf,
as much as I po&s;&s;ibly can, to &s;erve
either the county in general, or indi|viduals
of it; and when a man does
the be&s;t, he can, he may perhaps,
have his reward. But this country-city
member has led me off from
Edinburgh, to which I now return;
and I do &s;ay, that, if i&s;&s;uing an effec|tual
<HI>cong&eacute; d'elire,</HI> by which Sir Adam
Fergu&s;&s;on is made member for the
<PB N="59" REF="63">
capital of Scotland, be not power with
a witne&s;s, I am at a lo&s;s to conceive
what power is.</P>
<P>As to all this power a&s;&s;umed by
Mr. Dundas, I mu&s;t &s;ay <HI>miror!</HI> But
I certainly do not blame <HI>him.</HI> As <HI>Cato</HI>
&s;ays, when his gallant &s;on <HI>Marcus</HI> is

what <HI>&s;pecies,</HI> are they to be ranked,
who&s;e pu&s;illanimity is the cau&s;e that
this lion alone domineers in the fore&s;t?
Our late and pre&s;ent &s;ituation brings
to my remembrance &s;ome ver&s;es in an
old poem, which I have heard my

<PB N="60" REF="64">
applicable to a <HI>coalition</HI>
which in the la&s;t age took place in

<P>Yet I will do Mr. Dundas the
ju&s;tice to declare, that, large as his
power is, he has not much abu&s;ed it.
He has, indeed, taken very good care
of his relations! And why &s;hould he
not? Though, to be &s;ure, fle&s;h and
blood mu&s;t feel his having put his
young nephew over the heads of I
know not how many of us, as Soli|citor
General. But I do not believe
that he has been cruel, oppre&s;&s;ive, or
vindictive. I know but of two wrong
<PB N="61" REF="65">
things that he has done. One was
attacking Sir Lawrence Dundas in the
county of Orkney, <Q>in his own ma|nour,
where he was a father to the
people;</Q> as that ho&s;pitable, that
&s;plendid, that imperial baronet, &s;aid
to me, with tears in his eyes. The
other was per&s;uading my honoured
father, a venerable judge, in the de|cline
of his life, to embark in county
politicks, from which he had cea&s;ed
for twenty years, and make a parcel of
un&s;ub&s;tantial votes, which he abhorred,
in order to &s;upport Sir Adam Fer|gu&s;&s;on
in Ayr&s;hire, again&s;t the old
and the real intere&s;t of the county.
But both the&s;e in&s;tances were the
effects of <HI>politicks</HI> which I &s;ee to be
<HI>poi&s;on to the mind.</HI> I have therefore
no more objection to Mr. Dundas's
<PB N="62" REF="66">
being &s;ole <HI>Protector</HI> of Scotland, than
any other man, if we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;o ruled.
Nay, I have an <HI>intere&s;t</HI> that <HI>he</HI> &s;hould
be the per&s;on. For there is an here|ditary
friend&s;hip between our families.
We were at college together. We
have oft enjoyed
<Q><L>&mdash;The "happier hour</L>
<L>"Of &s;ocial plea&s;ure.&mdash;"</L></Q>
And I tru&s;t to the genero&s;ity of his
feelings, that, as he <HI>knows</HI> he once did
me a &s;evere injury, which I have from
my heart forgiven, he will be anxious
to make me full amends, if ever it
&s;hall be in his power. The de&s;ire of
elevation is as keen in me as in him|&s;elf;
though I am not &s;o well fitted
for party exploits.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="67">
As <HI>Nero</HI> wi&s;hed that the people of
Rome had but one neck, that he
might, if he plea&s;ed, cut them off at
a &s;ingle &s;troke.&mdash;So a deep, an artful
politician, will be de&s;irous to contract
the body which he wi&s;hes to com|mand.
It is ea&s;ier driving four hor&s;es
in hand than &s;ix. Be&s;ides, while there
are <HI>fifteen</HI> judges, the danger that they
may not be all tractable is propor|tionally
multiplied, when compared
with the number <HI>ten.</HI> There may
be a proud, an eloquent <HI>Alemoor,</HI>
who will watch like a dragon;&mdash;a
&s;turdy <HI>Elliock,</HI> who will not bend;&mdash;
a firm <HI>Stonefield,</HI> who not only has
a will of his own, but if one in high
place, tru&s;ting that he is &s;heltered
in his &s;ituation, pre&s;umes to be
coar&s;ely in&s;olent, can tell it him in
<PB N="64" REF="68">
his ear, aye, and to his beard;
&mdash;an honourable <HI>Rockville,</HI> who be|ing
of higher rank than any of them,
before he became a judge, will not
&s;toop&mdash;will not truckle&mdash;will not
be led&mdash;but will deliver his own ho|ne&s;t
good &s;en&s;e with the mild dignity
that becomes him.</P>
<P>It is very agreeable to con&s;ider,
that one bad judge cannot contami|nate
a number who are good, yet,
when we take the conver&s;e of the
propo&s;ition, we &s;hall find one good
judge can prevent the evil of many
bad ones. He can hold up truth and
ju&s;tice &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly, that bad
judges have not hardine&s;s enough to
turn a&s;ide from them; and, if they
&s;hould, he can alarm the country.

When a man of probity and &s;pirit, a

&mdash;when &s;uch a man &s;its among our
judges, &s;hould they be di&s;po&s;ed to do
wrong, he can make them hear and
tremble. My honoured father told
me, that Sir <HI>Walter Pringle</HI> "&s;poke

he was at the bar. "He would cram
a "deci&s;ion down their throats."</P>
<P><HI>Duncan Forbes</HI> of <HI>Culloden,</HI> when

my authority for this. I do not &s;ay
that the toa&s;t was very delicate, or
even quite decent; but it may give
&s;ome notion what &s;ort of judges there
<HI>may</HI> be. It is well known that <HI>Forbes,</HI>
by the &s;ingle weight of his character,
a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly and boldly urged, made a
very great alteration to the better
upon the court, and &s;hewed <HI>Unum
Hominem pluris valui&s;&s;e quam Civi|tatem.</HI></P>
<P>A number of judges, taken from
different parts of the country, diffu&s;es
and divides that private and imper|ceptible
influence which mu&s;t ever be
in a narrow country. One prejudice
is checked and counterbalanced by
<PB N="67" REF="71">
another. A judge from the north of
the Tay is corrected by a judge from
the &s;outh of the Tay, and is again cor|rected
by him, in his turn.&mdash;I &s;olemnly
declare, I mean no reflection again&s;t
the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion, farther than that
they are not exempted from the frail|ties
incident to man&mdash;that human
nature is human nature every where,
and in a narrow country is more liable
than in a great country, to what I
&s;hall call&mdash;hone&s;t bias.</P>
<P>With a plau&s;ible appearance, it has
been propagated from company to
company, that, were there fewer
Lords of Se&s;&s;ion, there would be more
&s;ecurity from their re&s;pon&s;ibility; as
di&s;grace, which is light when &s;hared
among&s;t a number, falls heavy upon
<PB N="68" REF="72">
a few.&mdash;But again&s;t this you &s;hall
have an unan&s;werable argument.&mdash;
<Q>If they are hone&s;t and honourable
men, they will not be the le&s;s &s;o
that they are <HI>fifteen.</HI> If they are
not, and mean to do wrong, a junto
of <HI>ten</HI> can do it with more facility.</Q>
<HI>Non meus hic &s;ermo e&s;t:</HI> I owe it to

Bo&s;well of Auchinleck</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Thomas Bo&s;well</HI> was the fir&s;t <HI>Laird</HI> of <HI>Auchin|leck</HI> (pronounced <HI>Affleck</HI>) Ayr&s;hire, after the e&s;tate had fallen to the Crown by the forfeiture of the very ancient family of <HI>that ilk (i. e.</HI> of the <HI>&s;ame name)</HI> there being no record nor tradition of any other family having it. I am told the <HI>Afflecks</HI> of <HI>England</HI> are the heirs of the forfeited family. I am proud of the <HI>connection;</HI> but &s;hould be unwilling to re&s;ign to them the <HI>e&s;tate,</HI> of which they have now no need. <HI>Thomas Bo&s;well</HI> was a de&s;cendant of the family of <HI>Balmuto,</HI> in <HI>Fife,</HI> who&s;e e&s;tate was purcha&s;ed in this century by a younger &s;on of my family. The wife of <HI>Thomas Bo&s;well</HI> was a daughter of <HI>Campbell</HI> of <HI>Londoun,</HI> and a grand-daughter of the forfeited <HI>Affleck.</HI> He was honoured, in 1504, with a charter from James IV. of Scotland, <Q><HI>Dilecto familiari no&s;tro&mdash;pro bono et fideli &s;ervitio nobis pre&s;tito.</HI></Q> He was killed with his King at the <HI>fatal field</HI> of <HI>Flodden,</HI> in 1513, fighting again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> though he was him&s;elf of old York|&s;hire extraction, being de&s;cended of the re|&s;pectable family of <HI>Bo&s;ville</HI> or <HI>Bo&s;well</HI> (for both they and we have &s;pelt it both ways at different times) of <HI>Gunthwait,</HI> in the We&s;t Riding. After a &s;eparation for ages, I united our <HI>branch</HI> in cordial friend&s;hip with the <HI>Stock,</HI> our <HI>Chief</HI> the late <HI>Godfrey Bo&s;ville,</HI> E&s;q. as hone&s;t a man, as perfect an example of <Q>the noble&s;t work of God,</Q> as ever breathed. That friend&s;hip is continued with his &s;on <HI>William Bo&s;ville,</HI> E&s;q. who, with his father's hone&s;t heart, has the cu|rio&s;ity of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> which he has gratified very exten&s;ively. He is to let me have a freehold in York&s;hire, a &s;mall bit of the old manour, which will connect us from generation to generation.&mdash;If it &s;hould be a&s;ked, What has this note to do here? I an&s;wer&mdash;to illu&s;trate the authour of the text. And to "pour out all my&s;elf as old <HI>Montaigne,</HI>" I wi&s;h all this to be known; and you who cen&s;ure it, have read it, and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> therefore know it. I am at home in York&s;hire; and I la&s;t year a&s;&s;i&s;ted at that glorious meeting, where loyalty and liberty united in addre&s;&s;ing his Maje&s;ty.</NOTE>, a true heart

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE this Letter was fini&s;hed, I have read
"<HI>The Rights of Juries vindicated,</HI> in the ca&s;e
of the <HI>Dean of St. A&s;aph,</HI> in the <HI>King's Bench,</HI>"
where Mr. <HI>Er&s;kine</HI> added &s;o much to the lu&s;tre
of his profe&s;&s;ional character; and, incon|&s;iderable
as my approbation may be, I cannot
refrain from &s;aying, that Mr. <HI>Welch's</HI> &s;peech
upon that occa&s;ion appears to me, for legal
knowledge, acute rea&s;oning, and true con&s;titu|tional
&s;pirit, to be a ma&s;terly performance,
and to e&s;tabli&s;h, beyond que&s;tion, that the
Juries of <HI>England</HI> are judges of law as well as
of fact, in <HI>many civil,</HI> and in <HI>all criminal</HI> trials.
Let me be al&s;o permitted to add one to the
number of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects who heartily
honour Mr. <HI>Ju&s;tice Willes,</HI> for his clear, free,
yet temperate doctrine, delivered as a judge
not unworthy to have been one at the trial of
the Seven Bi&s;hops.&mdash;That my principles of
<HI>re&s;i&s;tance</HI> may not be mi&s;apprehended, any more
than my principles of <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,</HI> I prote&s;t that I
&s;hould be the la&s;t man in the world to encou|rage
juries to contradict, ra&s;hly, wantonly, or
perver&s;ely, the opinion of the judges. On the
contrary, I would have them li&s;ten re&s;pectfully
to the advice they receive from the Bench, by
<PB N="107" REF="111">
which they may often be well directed in form|ing
their own opinion; which, "and not ano|ther's,"
is the opinion they are to return upon
their oaths. But where, after due attention to
all that the judge has &s;aid, they are decidedly
of a different opinion from him, they have not
only a <HI>power</HI> and a <HI>right,</HI> but they are <HI>bound in
con&s;cience,</HI> to bring in a verdict accordingly.
Thus it was in the late ca&s;e of <HI>Spence,</HI> at Edin|burgh,
which I have mentioned. The jury,
with every bias for the &s;ecurity of their own
property and peace, with every di&s;po&s;ition, as
good citizens, to check a de&s;perate rage of
mobbing, were neverthele&s;s &s;atisfied that that
young &s;oldier, my client, then the pri&s;oner at
the bar, (upon the <HI>general i&s;&s;ue,</HI><Q><HI>compounded of
law and of fact,</HI></Q> to u&s;e the ever-memorable
words of Baron <HI>Eyre,</HI> in Colonel <HI>Gordon's</HI> trial)
was not guilty of the felonious <HI>fire-rai&s;ing,</HI> or
<HI>ar&s;on,</HI> with which he was charged; and there|fore
they acquitted him, at which my heart re|bounded.
It is but ju&s;tice to add, that we have
at Edinburgh a mo&s;t re&s;pectable gentleman, Sir
<HI>William Forbes</HI> of <HI>Pit&s;ligo,</HI> who, when &s;itting as
a juryman, and hearing one of the judges mutter
audibly, that <Q>the law mu&s;t be left to the
court!</Q> ro&s;e in his place, and, with a proper
courage, a&s;&s;erted the <HI>full right</HI> of him&s;elf and
his bretheren; which had a very good effect.</P>
