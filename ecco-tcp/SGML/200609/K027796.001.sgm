the &s;ingle Idea of the Only One God into &s;everal Per&s;ons, under

<P>And on the other hand, the nature of Moral Philo&s;ophy being
&s;uch, as never to treat of things in particular, but in general; the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fable of the <HI>Iliad.</HI></NOTE> IN every de&s;ign which a man deliberately undertakes, the end
he propo&s;es is the fir&s;t thing in his mind, and that by which
he governs the whole work, and all its parts: Thus &s;ince the End
of the Epic Poem is to regulate the Manners, 'tis with this fir&s;t
view the Poet ought to begin.</P>
<P>But there is a great difference between the Philo&s;ophical and
the Poetical doctrine of Manners. The Schoolmen content
them&s;elves with treating of Virtues and Vices in general: the
in&s;tructions they give are proper for all States, People, and for
all Ages. But the Poet has a nearer regard to his own Coun|try,
and the nece&s;&s;ities of his own nation. With this de&s;ign he
makes choice of &s;ome piece of morality, the mo&s;t proper and
ju&s;t he can imagin: And in order to pre&s;s this home, he makes
le&s;s u&s;e of the force of Rea&s;oning, than of the power of In&s;inua|tion;
accommodating him&s;elf to the particular cu&s;toms and inclina|tions
of tho&s;e, who are to be the &s;ubject, or the readers, of his work.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee how <HI>Homer</HI> has acquitted him&s;elf in all the&s;e
re&s;pects.</P>
<P>He &s;aw the <HI>Grecians,</HI> for whom he de&s;ign'd his Poem, were
divided into as many States as they had capital Cities. Each was
<PB N="iv" REF="14">
a Body Politick apart, and had its form of government indepen|dent
from all the re&s;t. And yet the&s;e di&s;tinct States were very
often oblig'd to unite together in one body again&s;t their com|mon
Enemies. The&s;e were two very different &s;orts of Govern|ment,
&s;uch as could not be comprehended in one maxim of
morality, and in one &s;ingle Poem.</P>
<P>The Poet therefore has made two di&s;tinct Fables of them.
The one is for <HI>Greece</HI> in general, united into one body, but
compos'd of parts independent on each other; and the other
for each particular &s;tate, con&s;ider'd as they were in time of peace,
without the former circum&s;tances and the nece&s;&s;ity of being
united.</P>
<P>As for the fir&s;t &s;ort of government, in the Union or rather
in the Confederacy of many independent States; experience has
always made it appear, <Q REND="inline">"That nothing &s;o much cau&s;es &s;ucce&s;s
as a due &s;ubordination, and a right under&s;tanding among the
chief commanders. And on the other hand, the inevitable
ruin of &s;uch confederacies proceeds from the heats, jealou&s;ies
and ambition of the differerent leaders, and the di&s;contents of
&s;ubmitting to a &s;ingle General."</Q> All &s;orts of States, and in
particular the <HI>Grecians,</HI> had dearly experienc'd this truth. So that
the mo&s;t u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truction that could be given
them, was, to lay before their eyes the lo&s;s which both the
People and the Princes mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;uffer, by the ambition,
di&s;cord, and ob&s;tinacy of the latter.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> then has taken for the foundation of his Fable this
great Truth; That a Mi&s;under&s;tanding between Princes is the
Ruin of their own States. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ing (&s;ays he) the Anger of <HI>Achil|les,</HI>
&s;o pernicious to the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and the cau&s;e of &s;o many
Heroe's deaths, occa&s;ion'd by the Di&s;cord and Separation of <HI>Aga|memnon</HI>
and that Prince."</Q></P>
<P>But that this truth may be compleatly and fully known, there is
need of a &s;econd to &s;upport it. 'Tis nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch a de&s;ign, not only
to repre&s;ent the Confederate States at fir&s;t di&s;agreeing among them|&s;elves,
and from thence unfortunate; but to &s;how the &s;ame States
afterwards reconciled and united, and of con&s;equence victorious.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="15">
Let us now &s;ee how he has joyn'd all the&s;e in one general
action.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Several Princes independent on one another were united a|gain&s;t
a common enemy. The per&s;on whom they had elected
their General, offers an affront to the mo&s;t valiant of all the
Confederates. This offended Prince is &s;o far provoked, as to
relinqui&s;h the Union, and ob&s;tinately refu&s;e to fight for the
common cau&s;e. This Mi&s;-under&s;tanding gives the enemy &s;uch
an advantage, that the Allies are very near quitting their de|&s;ign
with di&s;honour. He him&s;elf who made the &s;eparation is
not exempt from &s;haring the misfortune which he brought up|on
his party. For having permitted his intimate friend to
&s;uccour them in a great nece&s;&s;ity, this friend is kill'd by the
enemy's General. Thus the contending Princes being both
made wi&s;er at their own co&s;t, are reconcil'd, and unite again:
Then this valiant Prince not only obtains the victory in the
publick cau&s;e, but revenges his private wrongs by killing with
his own hands the author of the death of his friend."</Q></P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t Platform of the Poem, and the Fiction, which
reduces into one important and univer&s;al Action all the particu|lars
upon which it turns.</P>
<P>In the next place it mu&s;t be render'd Probable by the circum&s;tan|ces
of times, places and per&s;ons; Some per&s;ons mu&s;t be found
out, already known by Hi&s;tory or otherwi&s;e, whom we may
with Probability make the actors and per&s;onages of this Fable.
<HI>Homer</HI> has made choice of the &s;iege of <HI>Troy,</HI> and feign'd that this
action happen'd there. To a Phantome of his brain, whom he
would paint valiant and cholerick, he has given the name of <HI>A|chilles</HI>;
that of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> to his General; that of <HI>Hector</HI> to the
Enemies Commander, and &s;o to the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, he was oblig'd to accommodate him&s;elf to the manners,
cu&s;toms, and genius of the <HI>Greeks</HI> his Auditors, the better to make
them attend to the in&s;truction of his Poem; and to gain their
approbation by prai&s;ing them: So that they might the better
forgive him the repre&s;entation of their own faults in &s;ome of his
<PB N="vi" REF="16">
chief Per&s;onages. He admirably di&s;charges all the&s;e duties, by
making the&s;e brave Princes and tho&s;e victorious people all <HI>Greci|ans,</HI>
and the fathers of tho&s;e he had a mind to commend.</P>
<P>But not being content, in a work of &s;uch a length, to propo&s;e
only the principal point of the Moral, and to fill up the re&s;t with
u&s;ele&s;s ornaments and foreign incidents, he extends this Moral by
all its nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences. As for in&s;tance in the &s;ubject
before us, 'tis not enough to know, that a good under&s;tanding
ought always to be maintain'd among Confederates: 'Tis likewi&s;e
of equal importance, that if there happens any divi&s;ion, care mu&s;t
be taken to keep it &s;ecret from the enemy, that their ignorance
of this advantage may prevent their making u&s;e of it. And in
the &s;econd place, when their concord is but counterfeit and
only in appearance, one &s;hould never pre&s;s the enemy too clo&s;e|ly;
for this would di&s;cover the weakne&s;s which we ought to
conceal from them.</P>
<P>The Epi&s;ode of <HI>Patroclus</HI> mo&s;t admirably furni&s;hes us with the&s;e
two in&s;tructions. For when he appear'd in the arms of <HI>Achilles,</HI>
the <HI>Trojans,</HI> who took him for that Prince now reconciled and
united to the Confederates, immediately gave ground, and quit|ted
the advantages they had before over the <HI>Greeks.</HI> But <HI>Patro|clus,</HI>
who &s;hould have been contented with this &s;ucce&s;s, pre&s;&s;es
upon <HI>Hector</HI> too boldly, and by obliging him to fight, &s;oon di&s;|covers
that it was not the true <HI>Achilles</HI> who was clad in his ar|mour,
but a Heroe of much inferior prowe&s;s. So that <HI>Hector</HI>
kills him, and regains tho&s;e advantages which the <HI>Trojans</HI> had lo&s;t,
on the opinion that <HI>Achilles</HI> was reconciled.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fable of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI></NOTE> THE <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> was not de&s;ign'd, like the <HI>Iliad,</HI> for the in&s;tru|ction
of all the States of <HI>Greece</HI> join'd in one body, but for each
State in particular. As a State is compos'd of two parts; the
Head which commands, and the Members which obey; there are
in&s;tructions requi&s;ite for both, to teach the one to govern, and
the others to &s;ubmit to Government.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="17">
There are two Virtues nece&s;&s;ary to one in authority, Prudence
to order, and Care to &s;ee his orders put in execution. The Pru|dence
of a Politician is not acquir'd but by a long experience in
all &s;orts of bu&s;ine&s;s, and by an acquaintance with all the diffe|rent
forms of Governments and States. The Care of the Admi|ni&s;tration
&s;uffers not him that has the Government to rely upon
others, but requires his own pre&s;ence: And Kings who are ab|&s;ent
from their States, are in danger of lo&s;ing them, and give
occa&s;ion to great di&s;orders and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e two points may be ea&s;ily united in one and the &s;ame
man. <Q REND="inline">* "A King for&s;akes his Kingdom to vi&s;it the courts
of &s;everal Princes, where he learns the manners and cu&s;toms
of different nations. From hence there naturally ari&s;es a va&s;t
number of incidents, of dangers, and of adventures, very u&s;e|ful
for a Political In&s;titution. On the other &s;ide, this Ab&s;ence
gives way to the di&s;orders which happen in his own kingdom,
and which end not till his return, who&s;e pre&s;ence only can re|e&s;tabli&s;h
all things."</Q> Thus the Ab&s;ence of a King has the &s;ame
effects in this Fable, as the Divi&s;ion of the Princes had in the
former.</P>
<P>The Subjects have &s;carce any need but of one general max|im,
which is, To &s;uffer them&s;elves to be govern'd, and to obey
faithfully; whatever rea&s;on they may imagine again&s;t the orders
they receiv'd. It is ea&s;y to join this in&s;truction with the other,
by be&s;towing on this wi&s;e and indu&s;trious Prince &s;uch Subjects,
as in his ab&s;ence would rather follow their own judgment than
his commands: and by demon&s;trating the misfortunes which this
di&s;obedience draws upon them, the evil con&s;equences which al|mo&s;t
infallibly attend the&s;e particular notions, which are entirely
different from the general Idaea of him who ought to govern.</P>
<P>But as it was nece&s;&s;ary that the Princes in the <HI>Iliad</HI> &s;hou'd be
cholerick and quarrel&s;ome, &s;o it is nece&s;&s;ary in the Fable of the
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> that the chief per&s;on &s;hould be &s;age and prudent. This
rai&s;es a difficulty in the Fiction; becau&s;e this per&s;on ought to be
ab&s;ent for the two rea&s;ons aforemention'd, which are e&s;&s;ential to
the Fable, and which con&s;titute the principal aim of it: But
<PB N="viii" REF="18">
he cannot ab&s;ent him&s;elf, without offending again&s;t another
maxim of equal importance; <HI>viz.</HI> That a King &s;hould upon no
account leave his Country.</P>
<P>It is true, there are &s;ometimes &s;uch nece&s;&s;ities as &s;ufficiently
excu&s;e the Prudence of a Politician in this point. But &s;uch a
nece&s;&s;ity is a thing important enough of it &s;elf to &s;upply matter
for another Poem, and this multiplication of the action would
be vicious. To prevent which in the fir&s;t place, this Nece&s;&s;ity
and the departure of the Hero mu&s;t be disjoin'd from the Poem;
and in the &s;econd place, the Hero having been oblig'd to ab|&s;ent
him&s;elf, for a rea&s;on antecedent to the action and plac'd
di&s;tinct from the Fable, he ought not &s;o far to embrace this oppor|nity
of in&s;tructing him&s;elf, as to ab&s;ent him&s;elf voluntarily from
his own Government. For at this rate, his Ab&s;ence would be
meerly Voluntary, and one might with rea&s;on lay to his charge
all the di&s;orders which might arrive.</P>
<P>Thus in the con&s;titution of the Fable, he ought not to take
for his action, and for the foundation of his Poem, the Depar|ture
of a Prince from his own country, nor his voluntary &s;tay
in any other place; but his Return, and this return retarded a|gain&s;t
his will. This is the fir&s;t Idea <HI>Homer</HI> gives us of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ody&s;&s;. 5.</NOTE>
His Hero appears at fir&s;t in a de&s;olate I&s;land, &s;itting upon the
&s;ide of the Sea, which with tears in his eyes he looks upon as
the ob&s;tacle that had &s;o long oppos'd his Return, and detain'd
him from revi&s;iting his own dear Country.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, &s;ince this forc'd delay might more naturally and
u&s;ually happen to &s;uch as make voyages by &s;ea; <HI>Homer</HI> has ju|diciou&s;ly
made choice of a Prince who&s;e Kingdom was in an
I&s;land.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee then how he has feign'd all this Action, making
his Hero a per&s;on in years, becau&s;e Years are requi&s;ite to in&s;truct
a man in Prudence and Policy.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A Prince had been oblig'd to for&s;ake his native Country,
and to head an Army of his Subjects in a foreign expedition.
Having gloriou&s;ly perform'd this enterpri&s;e, he was marching
home again, and conducting his Subjects to his own State.
<PB N="ix" REF="19">
But &s;pite of all the attempts, with which his eagerne&s;s to re|turn
had in&s;pir'd him, he was &s;topp'd by the way by tempe&s;ts
for &s;everal years, and ca&s;t upon &s;everal countries differing from
each other in Manners and Government. In the&s;e dangers
his Companions, not always following his orders, peri&s;h'd
through their own fault. The Grandees of his country &s;trange|ly
abu&s;e his ab&s;ence, and rai&s;e no &s;mall di&s;orders at home.
They con&s;ume his e&s;tate, con&s;pire to de&s;troy his &s;on, would
con&s;train his Queen to accept of one of them for her Hu&s;|band;
and indulge them&s;elves in all violence, &s;o much the
more, becau&s;e they were per&s;uaded he would never return.
But at la&s;t he returns, and di&s;covering him&s;elf only to his
&s;on and &s;ome others, who had continu'd firm to him, he is an
eye-witne&s;s of the in&s;olence of his enemies, puni&s;hes them ac|cording
to their de&s;erts, and re&s;tores to his I&s;land that tran|quility
and repo&s;e to which they had been &s;trangers during
his ab&s;ence."</Q></P>
<P>As the Truth, which &s;erves for foundation to this fiction
is, that the Ab&s;ence of a per&s;on from his own home, or
his neglect of his own affairs, is the cau&s;e of great di&s;orders:
So the Principal point of the Action, and the mo&s;t E&s;&s;ential
one, is the Ab&s;ence of the Heroe. This fills almo&s;t all the
Poem: For not only this real ab&s;ence la&s;ted &s;everal years, but
even when the Heroe return'd, he does not di&s;cover him&s;elf;
and this prudent di&s;gui&s;e, from whence he reap'd &s;o much ad|vantage,
has the &s;ame effect upon the Authors of the di&s;or|ders,
and all others who knew him not, as his real ab&s;ence
had before, &s;o that he is ab&s;ent as to them, 'till the very mo|ment
of their puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>After the Poet had thus compos'd his Fable, and join'd the Fi|ction
to the Truth, he then makes choice of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> the King of
the I&s;le of <HI>Ithaca,</HI> to maintain the character of his chief Per&s;onage,
and be&s;tow'd the re&s;t upon <HI>Telemachus, Penelope, Antinous,</HI> and
others, whom he calls by what names he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not here in&s;i&s;t upon the many excellent advices, which
are &s;o many parts, and natural con&s;equences of the fundamental
<PB N="x" REF="20">
Truth; and which the Poet very dextrou&s;ly lays down in tho&s;e
fictions, which are the Epi&s;odes and Members of the entire Acti|on.
Such for in&s;tance are the&s;e advices: Not to intrude one's
&s;elf into the My&s;teries of Government, which the Prince keeps
&s;ecret: This is repre&s;ented to us by the winds &s;hut up in a bull|hide,
which the mi&s;erable Companions of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> would needs be
&s;o fooli&s;h as to pry into. Not to &s;uffer ones &s;elf to be led away

<P>This Poem is more u&s;eful to the People than the <HI>Iliad,</HI> where

<P>'Tis plain, I &s;ay, that each of the&s;e particular Maxims might
&s;erve for the Ground-work of a Fiction, and one might make
four di&s;tinct Fables out of them. May one not then put all the&s;e
into one &s;ingle <HI>Epopea?</HI> Not unle&s;s one &s;ingle Fable can be made
out of all. The Poet indeed may have &s;o much skill as to unite
all into one Body, as Members and Parts, each of which taken
a&s;under would be imperfect; and if he joins them &s;o, as that
this Conjunction &s;hall be no hindrance at all to the Unity and
the regular Simplicity of the Fable. This is what <HI>Homer</HI> has done
with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s in the compo&s;ition of the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P>1. <HI>The Divi&s;ion between</HI> Achilles <HI>and his Allies tended to the ruin
of their De&s;igns.</HI> 2. Patroclus <HI>comes to their relief in the Armour
of this Heroe, and</HI> Hector <HI>retreats.</HI> 3. <HI>But this young Man pu&s;hing
the advantage, which his di&s;guize gave him, too far, ventures to en|gage
with</HI> Hector <HI>him&s;elf; but not being ma&s;ter of</HI> Achilles<HI>'s &s;trength
(whom he only repre&s;ented in outward appearance) he is killed, and by</HI>
<PB N="xii" REF="22">
<HI>this means leaves the</HI> Grecian <HI>Affairs in the &s;ame di&s;order, from
which in that di&s;gui&s;e he came to free them.</HI> 4. Achilles <HI>provok'd
at the death of his Friend, is reconciled, and revenges his lo&s;s by the
death of</HI> Hector. The&s;e various incidents being thus united, do
not make different Actions and Fables, but are only the uncom|pleat
and unfini&s;h'd parts of one and the &s;ame Action and Fable,
which alone can be &s;aid to be compleat and entire: And all the&s;e
Maxims of the Moral, are ea&s;ily reduc'd into the&s;e two parts,
which in my opinion cannot be &s;eparated without enervating the
force of both. The two parts are the&s;e, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Concordi&acirc; res|parvae cre&s;cunt: di&s;cordi&acirc; mag|nae dilabuntur.</HI> Salu&s;t. de bello Jug.</NOTE> That a right Under|&s;tanding
is the pre&s;ervation, and Di&s;cord the de&s;truction of States.</P>
<P>Tho' then the Poet has made u&s;e of two parts in his Poems,
each of which might have &s;erv'd for a Fable, as we have ob|&s;erv'd:
Yet this Multiplication cannot be call'd a vicious and ir|regular
<HI>Polymythia,</HI> contrary to the nece&s;&s;ary Unity and Simplicity
of the Fable; but it gives the Fable another qualification, alto|gether
nece&s;&s;ary and regular, namely its Perfection and fini&s;hing
&s;troke.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the <HI>Acti|on</HI> of the Epic Poem.</NOTE> THE Action of a Poem is the Subject which the Poet un|dertakes,
propo&s;es, and builds upon. So that the Moral and the
In&s;tructions which are the End of the Epic Poem are not the
Matter of it. Tho&s;e the Poets leave in their Allegorical and fi|gurative
ob&s;curity. They only give notice at the <HI>Exordium,</HI> that
they &s;ing &s;ome <HI>Action.</HI> The <HI>Revenge of</HI> Achilles, the <HI>Return of</HI>
Uly&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Since then the Action is the Matter of a Fable, it is evident
that whatever incidents are e&s;&s;ential to the Fable, or con&s;ti|tute
a part of it, are nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o to the Action, and are parts
of the Epic Matter, none of which ought to be omitted. Such
for in&s;tance, are the contention of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and <HI>Achilles,</HI> the
&s;laughter <HI>Hector</HI> makes in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army, the Re union of
the <HI>Greek</HI> Princes; and la&s;tly, the Re-&s;ettlement and Victory
which was the con&s;equence of that Re-union.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="23">
There are four qualifications in the Epic Action: the fir&s;t is
its <HI>Unity,</HI> the &s;econd its <HI>Integrity,</HI> the third its <HI>Importance,</HI> the fourth
its <HI>Duration.</HI></P>
<P>The Unity of the Epic Action, as well as the Unity of the
Fable, does not con&s;i&s;t either in the Unity of the Heroe, or in
the Unity of Time: Three things I &s;uppo&s;e are nece&s;&s;ary to it.
The fir&s;t is, to make u&s;e of no Epi&s;ode but what ari&s;es from the
very platform and foundation of the Action, and is as it were a
natural member of the body. The &s;econd is, exactly to Unite
the&s;e Epi&s;odes and the&s;e Members with one another. And the
third is, never to fini&s;h any Epi&s;ode &s;o as it may &s;eem to be an
entire Action; but to let each Epi&s;ode &s;till appear in its own
particular nature, as the member of a body, and as a part of it
&s;elf not compleat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Be|ginning, Mid|dle, and End of the Action.</NOTE> <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> not only &s;ays that the Epic Action &s;hould be One,
but adds, that it &s;hould be entire, perfect, and compleat, and for
this purpo&s;e ought to have a <HI>Beginning,</HI> a <HI>Middle,</HI> and an <HI>End.</HI> The&s;e
three parts of a whole are too generally and univer&s;ally denoted
by the words, Beginning, Middle, and End; we may interpret
them more preci&s;ely, and &s;ay, That the Cau&s;es and De&s;igns of
an Action are the Beginning: That the Effects of the&s;e Cau&s;es,
and the Difficulties that are met with in the execution of the&s;e
de&s;igns, are the Middle; and that the Unravelling and Re&s;olution
of the&s;e difficulties are the End.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Action of the <HI>Iliad.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Homer</HI>'s de&s;ign in the <HI>Iliad</HI> is to relate the Anger and Re|venge
of <HI>Achilles.</HI> The Beginning of this Action is the Change
of <HI>Achilles</HI> from a calm to a pa&s;&s;ionate temper. The Middle
is the Effects of his Pa&s;&s;ion, and all the illu&s;trious Deaths it is
the Cau&s;e of. The End of this &s;ame Action is the Return of <HI>A|chilles</HI>
to his Calmne&s;s of temper again. All was quiet in the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Camp, when <HI>Agamemnon</HI> their General provokes <HI>Apollo</HI>
again&s;t them, whom he was willing to appea&s;e afterwards at the
co&s;t and prejudice of <HI>Achilles,</HI> who had no part in his fault.
This then is an exact Beginning: It &s;uppo&s;es nothing before,
and requires after it the Effects of this Anger. <HI>Achilles</HI> revenges
him&s;elf, and that is an exact Middle; it &s;uppo&s;es before it the
Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> this Revenge is the Effect of it. Then this
<PB N="xiv" REF="24">
Middle requires after it the Effects of this Revenge, which is
the Satisfaction of <HI>Achilles:</HI> for the Revenge had not been com|pleat,
unle&s;s <HI>Achilles</HI> had been &s;atisfied. By this means the Poet
makes his Heroe, after he was glutted by the Mi&s;chief he had
done to <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> by the death of <HI>Hector,</HI> and the Honour he
did his Friend, by in&s;ulting o'er his Murderer; he makes him, I
&s;ay, to be moved by the Tears and Misfortunes of King <HI>Priam.</HI>
We &s;ee him as calm at the End of the Poem, during the Fune|ral
of <HI>Hector,</HI> as he was at the Beginning of the Poem, whil&s;t
the Plague raged among the <HI>Grecians.</HI> This End is ju&s;t, &s;ince the
Calmne&s;s of temper <HI>Achilles</HI> re enjoy'd, is only an Effect of the
Revenge which ought to have preceded: And after this no Body
expects any more of his Anger. Thus has <HI>Homer</HI> been very exact
in the Beginning, Middle and End of the Action he made
choice of for the Subject of his <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Action of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI></NOTE> His De&s;ign in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> was to de&s;cribe the Return of <HI>Uly&s;|&s;es</HI>
from the Siege of <HI>Troy,</HI> and his Arrival at <HI>Ithaca.</HI> He opens
this Poem with the complaints of <HI>Minerva</HI> again&s;t <HI>Neptune,</HI> who
oppo&s;ed the Return of this Heroe, and again&s;t <HI>Calyp&s;o</HI> who de|tain'd
him in an I&s;land from <HI>Ithaca.</HI> Is this a Beginning? No;
doubtle&s;s, the Reader would know why <HI>Neptune</HI> is di&s;pleas'd with
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and how this Prince came to be with <HI>Calyp&s;o</HI>? He would know
how he came from <HI>Troy</HI> thither? The Poet an&s;wers his Demands
out of the Mouth of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> him&s;elf, who relates the&s;e things,
and begins the Action, by the Recital of his Travels from the
City of <HI>Troy.</HI> It &s;ignifies little whether the Beginning of the Ac|tion
be the Beginning of the Poem. The Beginning of this
Action is that which happens to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> when upon his leaving
<HI>Troy</HI> he bends his Cour&s;e for <HI>Ithaca.</HI> The Middle comprehends
all the Misfortunes he endured, and all the Di&s;orders of his own
Government. The End is the re-in&s;tating of this Hero in the
peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Kingdom, where he was acknowledg'd
by his Son, his Wife, his Father, and &s;everal others. The Poet
was &s;en&s;ible he &s;hould have ended ill had he gone no farther than
the death of the&s;e Princes, who were the Rivals and Enemies of
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> becau&s;e the Reader might have look'd for &s;ome Revenge
<PB N="xv" REF="25">
which the Subjects of the&s;e Princes might have taken, on him
who had kill'd their Sovereigns: But this Danger over, and the
People vanqui&s;hed and quieted, there was nothing more to be
expected. The Poem and the Action have all their Parts, and
no more.</P>
<P>But the Order of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> differs from that of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> in
that the <HI>Poem</HI> does not begin with the Beginning of the <HI>Action.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Cau&s;es and Beginning of the Action.</NOTE> The <HI>Cau&s;es of the Action</HI> are al&s;o what the Poet is oblig'd to
give an Account of. There are three &s;orts of Cau&s;es, the Hu|mours,
the Intere&s;ts, and the De&s;igns of Men; and the&s;e different
Cau&s;es of an Action are likewi&s;e often the Cau&s;es of one ano|ther,
every Man taking up tho&s;e Intere&s;ts in which his Humour
ingages him, and forming tho&s;e De&s;igns to which his Humour
and Intere&s;t incline him. Of all the&s;e the Poet ought to inform
his Readers, and render them con&s;picuous in his principal Per&s;o|nages.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> has ingeniou&s;ly begun his <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> with the Tran&s;actions
at <HI>Ithaca,</HI> during the ab&s;ence of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI> If he had begun with
the Travels of his Heroe, he would &s;carce have &s;poken of any one
el&s;e, and a Man might have read a great deal of the Poem, without
conceiving the lea&s;t Idea of <HI>Telemachus, Penelope,</HI> or her Suitors,
who had &s;o great a &s;hare in the Action; but in the beginning
he has pitch'd upon, be&s;ides the&s;e Per&s;onages, whom he di&s;co|vers,
he repre&s;ents <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in his full Length, and from the very
fir&s;t opening one &s;ees the Intere&s;t which the Gods take in the
Action.</P>
<P>The Skill and Care of the &s;ame Poet may be &s;een likewi&s;e in in|ducing
his Per&s;onages in the fir&s;t Book of his <HI>Iliad,</HI> where he
di&s;covers the Humours, the Intere&s;ts, and the De&s;igns of <HI>Agamem|non,</HI>
<HI>Achilles, Hector, Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and &s;everal others, and even of the
Deities. And in his Second he makes a Review of the <HI>Grecian</HI>
and <HI>Trojan</HI> Armies; which is full Evidence, that all we have here
&s;aid is very nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Middle or Intrigue of the Action.</NOTE> As the&s;e <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> are the <HI>Beginning</HI> of the Action, the oppo&s;ite
De&s;igns again&s;t that of the Hero are the <HI>Middle</HI> of it, and form
that Difficulty or <HI>Intrigue,</HI> which makes up the greate&s;t part of
<PB N="xvi" REF="26">
the Poem; the Solution or <HI>Unravelling</HI> commences when the
Reader begins to &s;ee that difficulty remov'd, and the doubts
clear'd up. <HI>Homer</HI> has divided each of his Poems into two Parts,
and has put a particular Intrigue, and the Solution of it, into
each Part.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Part of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is the Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> who is for
revenging him&s;elf upon <HI>Agamemnon</HI> by the means of <HI>Hector</HI> and
the <HI>Trojans.</HI> The <HI>Intrigue</HI> comprehends the three days Fight,
which happen'd in the Ab&s;ence of <HI>Achilles</HI>: and it con&s;i&s;ts on
one &s;ide in the re&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and the <HI>Grecians</HI>; and on
the other in the revengeful and inexorable Humour of <HI>Achilles,</HI>
which would not &s;uffer him to be reconcil'd. The Lo&s;s of the
<HI>Grecians</HI> and the De&s;pair of <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> prepare for a &s;olution by
the &s;atisfaction which the incens'd Heroe receiv'd from it. The
death of <HI>Patroclus</HI> join'd to the Offers of <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> which of it
&s;elf had prov'd ineffectual, remove this Difficulty, and make the
untravelling of the fir&s;t part.</P>
<P>This death is likewi&s;e the Beginning of the &s;econd Part; &s;ince
it puts <HI>Achilles</HI> upon the de&s;ign of revenging him&s;elf on <HI>Hector.</HI>
But the de&s;ign of <HI>Hector</HI> is oppo&s;ite to that of <HI>Achilles</HI>; This
<HI>Trojan</HI> is valiant, and re&s;olv'd to &s;tand on his own defence. This
Valour and Re&s;olution of <HI>Hector,</HI> are on his part the cau&s;e of the
Intrigue. All the Endeavours <HI>Achilles</HI> us'd, to meet with <HI>Hector</HI>
and be the death of him; and the contrary Endeavours of the
<HI>Trojan</HI> to keep out of his Reach, and defend him&s;elf; are the in|trigue;
which comprehends the battle of the la&s;t day. The un|ravelling
begins at the death of <HI>Hector</HI>; and be&s;ides that, it
contains the in&s;ulting of <HI>Achilles</HI> over his Body, the Honours
he paid to <HI>Patroclus,</HI> and the Intreaties of King <HI>Priam.</HI> The re|grets
of this King and the other <HI>Trojans,</HI> in the &s;orrowful Ob&s;e|quies
they paid to <HI>Hector</HI>'s body, end the unravelling; they ju|&s;tifie
the &s;atisfaction of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and demon&s;trate his Tranquil|lity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> is the return of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> into <HI>Itha|ca.
Neptune</HI> oppo&s;es it by rai&s;ing tempe&s;ts, and this makes the
Intrigue. The unravelling is the arrival of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> upon his own
<PB N="xvii" REF="27">
I&s;land, where <HI>Neptune</HI> could offer him no farther injury. The
&s;econd Part is the re-in&s;tating this Heroe in his own Govern|ment.
The Princes that are his Rivals, oppo&s;e him, and this is
a fre&s;h Intrigue: The Solution of it begins at their deaths,
and is compleated as &s;oon as the <HI>Ithacans</HI> were appeas'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Parts in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> have not one common In|trigue.
The Anger of <HI>Achilles</HI> forms both the Intrigues in the
<HI>Iliad</HI>; and it is &s;o far the Matter of this <HI>Epop&eacute;a,</HI> that the very
Beginning and End of this Poem depend on the Beginning and
End of this Anger. But let the De&s;ire <HI>Achilles</HI> had to revenge
him&s;elf, and the De&s;ire <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> had to return to his own Coun|try,
be never &s;o near ally'd, yet we cannot place them under
one and the &s;ame Notion: For that De&s;ire of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is not a
Pa&s;&s;ion that Begins and Ends in the Poem with the Action; 'tis
a natural Habit; nor does the Poet propo&s;e it for his Subject as
he does the Anger of <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>
<P>We have already ob&s;erv'd what is meant by the <HI>Intrigue,</HI> and
the <HI>Unravelling</HI> thereof; let us now &s;ay &s;omething of the Man|ner
of forming both. The&s;e two &s;hould ari&s;e naturally out of the
very E&s;&s;ence and Subject of the Poem, and are to be deduced
from thence. Their Conduct is &s;o exact and natural, that it &s;eems
as if their Action had pre&s;ented them with whatever they in|&s;erted,
without putting them&s;elves to the Trouble of a farther In|quiry.</P>
<P>What is more u&s;ual and natural to Warriors, than Anger,
Heat, Pa&s;&s;ion, and Impatience of bearing the lea&s;t Affront or
Di&s;re&s;pect? This is what forms the Intrigue of the <HI>Iliad</HI>; and
every thing we read there is nothing el&s;e but the Effect of this
Humour and the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>What more natural and u&s;ual Ob&s;tacle to tho&s;e who take
Voyages, than the Sea, the Winds, and the Storms? <HI>Homer</HI>
makes this the Intrigue of the fir&s;t Part of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI>: And
for the &s;econd, he makes u&s;e of almo&s;t the infallible effect of the
long Ab&s;ence of a Ma&s;ter, who&s;e return is quite de&s;pair'd of, <HI>viz.</HI>
the In&s;olence of his Servants and Neighbours, the Danger of his
Son and Wife, and the Seque&s;tration of his E&s;tate. Be&s;ides an Ab|&s;ence
of almo&s;t twenty Years, and the in&s;upportable Fatigues
<PB N="xviii" REF="28">
joyn'd to the Age of which <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> then was, might induce him
to believe that he &s;hould not be own'd by tho&s;e who thought him
dead, and who&s;e Intere&s;t it was to have him really &s;o. There|fore
if he had pre&s;ently declar'd who he was, and had call'd him|&s;elf
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> they would ea&s;ily have de&s;troy'd him as an Impo&s;tor,
before he had an Opportunity to make him&s;elf known.</P>
<P>There could be nothing more natural nor more nece&s;&s;ary
than this ingenious Di&s;gui&s;e, to which the advantages his Ene|mies
had taken of his Ab&s;ence had reduc'd him, and to which
his long Misfortunes had enur'd him. This allow'd him an op|portunity,
without hazarding any thing, of taking the be&s;t mea|&s;ures
he could, again&s;t tho&s;e per&s;ons who could not &s;o much as
mi&s;tru&s;t any harm from him. This way was afforded him by
the very Nature of his Action, to execute his De&s;igns, and over|come
the Ob&s;tacles it ca&s;t before him. And 'tis this con|te&s;t
between the Prudence and the Di&s;&s;imulation of a &s;ingle Man
on one hand, and the ungovernable In&s;olence of &s;o many Ri|vals
on the other, which con&s;titutes the Intrigue of the &s;econd
Part of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the End or Unravelling of the Action.</NOTE> If the <HI>Plot</HI> or <HI>Intrigue</HI> mu&s;t be natural, and &s;uch as &s;prings from

of the Plot, by a more &s;ure claim, mu&s;t have this Qualification,
and be a probable con&s;equence of all that went before. As this
is what the Readers regard more than the re&s;t, &s;o &s;hould the Poet
be more exact in it. This is the End of the Poem, and the la&s;t
Impre&s;&s;ion that is to be &s;tamp'd upon them.</P>
<P>We &s;hall find this in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey. Uly&s;&s;es</HI> by a Tempe&s;t is ca&s;t

and de&s;ires they would favor his Return to his own Coun|try
which was not very far di&s;tant. One cannot &s;ee any rea&s;on

to a Heroe whom he &s;eem'd to have in great e&s;teem. The
<HI>Phaeacians</HI> indeed had heard him tell the Story of his Adventures;
and in this fabulous recital con&s;i&s;ted all the advantage they could
derive from his Pre&s;ence; for the Art of War which they
admir'd in him, his Undauntedne&s;s under Dangers, his indefati|gable
Patience, and other Virtues, were &s;uch as the&s;e I&s;landers
<PB N="xix" REF="29">
were not u&s;ed to. All their Talent lay in &s;inging and dan|cing,
and what&s;oever was charming in a quiet life. And here
we &s;ee how dextrou&s;ly <HI>Homer</HI> prepares the Incidents he makes u&s;e
of. The&s;e People could do no le&s;s, for the Account with which
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> had &s;o much entertain'd them, than afford him a Ship
and a &s;afe Convoy, which was of little expence or trouble to them.</P>
<P>When he arriv'd, his long Ab&s;ence, and the Travels which had
disfigur'd him, made him altogether unknown; and the Danger
he would have incurr'd had he di&s;cover'd him&s;elf too &s;oon,
forced him to a Di&s;gui&s;e: La&s;tly, this Di&s;gui&s;e gave him an Op|portunity
of &s;urprizing tho&s;e young Suitors, who for &s;everal years
together had been accu&s;tomed to nothing but to &s;leep well, and

<P>It was from the&s;e Examples that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> drew this Rule,

Pa&s;&s;ion that &s;eems mo&s;t peculiar to Epic Poetry, is <HI>Admiration.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides this <HI>Admiration,</HI> which in general di&s;tingui&s;hes the E|pic
Poem from the Dramatic; each Epic Poem has likewi&s;e &s;ome
<HI>peculiar Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> which di&s;tingui&s;hes it in particular from other Epic
Poems, and con&s;titutes a kind of &s;ingular and individual diffe|rence
<PB N="xx" REF="30">
between the&s;e Poems of the &s;ame Species. The&s;e &s;ingular
Pa&s;&s;ions corre&s;pond to the <HI>Character</HI> of the <HI>Hero. Anger</HI> and <HI>Ter|ror</HI>
reign throughout the <HI>Iliad,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Achilles</HI> is angry, and the
mo&s;t Terrible of all Men. The <HI>Aeneid</HI> has all <HI>&s;oft</HI> and <HI>tender
Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> becau&s;e that is the Character of <HI>Aeneas.</HI> The Prudence,
Wi&s;dom, and Con&s;tancy of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> do not allow him either of
the&s;e Extremes, therefore the Poet does not permit one of them
to be predominant in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> He confines him&s;elf to <HI>Ad|miration</HI>
only, which he carries to an higher pitch than in the
<HI>Iliad</HI>: And 'tis upon this account that he introduces a great ma|ny
more Machines in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> into the Body of the Action,
than are to be &s;een in the Actions of the other two Poems.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Manners.</NOTE> The <HI>Manners</HI> of the Epic Poem ought to be <HI>poetically good,</HI>
but it is not nece&s;&s;ary they be always <HI>morally</HI> &s;o. They are poe|tically
good, when one may di&s;cover the Virtue or Vice, the
good or ill Inclinations, of every one who &s;peaks or acts: They
are poetically bad, when Per&s;ons are made to &s;peak or act out of
Character, or incon&s;i&s;tently, or unequally. The Manners of <HI>Ae|neas</HI>
and of <HI>Mezentius</HI> are equally good, con&s;ider'd poetically,
becau&s;e they equally demon&s;trate the Piety of the one, and the
Impiety of the other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the Heroe.</NOTE> 'Tis requi&s;ite to make the &s;ame di&s;tinction between a Heroe
in Morality and a Heroe in Poetry, as between moral and poe|tical
Goodne&s;s. <HI>Achilles</HI> had as much right to the latter as
<HI>Aeneas. Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;ays, that the Heroe of a Poem &s;hould be nei|ther
good nor bad; neither advanc'd above the re&s;t of mankind
by his Virtues, or &s;unk beneath 'em by his Vices; that he may
be the properer and fuller Example to others, both what to imi|tate
and what to decline.</P>
<P>The other Qualifications of the <HI>Manners,</HI> are, that they be
<HI>&s;uitable</HI> to the Cau&s;es which either rai&s;e or di&s;cover them in the
Per&s;ons; that they have an exact <HI>Re&s;emblance</HI> to what Hi&s;tory or
Fable have delivered of tho&s;e per&s;ons to whom they are a&s;crib'd;
and that there be an <HI>Equality</HI> in them, &s;o that no man is made
to act or &s;peak out of his character.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unity of the Character.</NOTE> But this Equality is not &s;ufficient for the <HI>Unity of the Character</HI>:
'tis further nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;ame Spirit appear in all &s;ort of
<PB N="xxi" REF="31">
Encounters. Thus <HI>Aeneas</HI> acting with great <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Mildne&s;s</HI>
in the fir&s;t part of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> which requires no other Cha|racter;
and afterwards appearing illu&s;trious in Heroic valour
in the wars of the &s;econd part, but there without any ap|pearance
either of a hard or a &s;oft di&s;po&s;ition, would doubtle&s;s
be far from offending again&s;t the <HI>Equality</HI> of the Manners:
But yet there would be no <HI>Simplicity</HI> or <HI>Unity</HI> in the Character.
So that be&s;ides the Qualities that claim their particular place up|on
different occa&s;ions, there mu&s;t be One appearing throughout,
which commands over all the re&s;t: And without this we may af|firm
'tis no Character.</P>
<P>One may indeed make a Heroe as valiant as <HI>Achilles,</HI> as
pious as <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and as prudent as <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI> But 'tis a meer
Chimaera to imagine a Heroe that has the Valour of <HI>Achil|les,</HI>
the Piety of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and the Prudence of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> at one and
the &s;ame time. This Vi&s;ion might happen to an Author, who
would &s;uit the character of a Heroe to whatever each part of
the Action might naturally require, without regarding the E&s;&s;ence
of the Fable, or the Unity of the Character in the &s;ame per&s;on
upon all &s;orts of occa&s;ions: This Heroe would be the milde&s;t,
be&s;t-natur'd Prince in the world, and al&s;o the mo&s;t cholerick, hard-hearted,
and implacable creature imaginable; he would be ex|treamly
tender like <HI>Aeneas,</HI> extreamly violent like <HI>Achilles,</HI> and
yet have the indifference of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> that is incapable of the
two extremes. Would it not be in vain for the Poet to call this
Per&s;on by the &s;ame name throughout?</P>
<P>Let us reflect on the effects it would produce in &s;everal Poems,
who&s;e Authors were of opinion, that the chief character of a
Heroe is that of an accompli&s;h'd Man. They would be all a|like,
all valiant in Battle, prudent in Council, pious in the acts
of Religion, courteous, civil, magnificent; and la&s;tly endued
with all the prodigious Virtues any Poet could invent. All this
would be independent from the Action and the Subject of the
Poem; and upon &s;eeing each Heroe &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the
work, we &s;hould not ea&s;ily gue&s;s, to what Action and to what
Poem the Heroe belong'd? So that we &s;hould &s;ee that none of tho&s;e
would have a Character, &s;ince the Character is that which makes
<PB N="xxii" REF="32">
a per&s;on di&s;cernable, and which di&s;tingui&s;hes him from all others.</P>
<P>This commanding Quality in <HI>Achilles</HI> is his Anger, in <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>
the art of Di&s;&s;imulation, in <HI>Aeneas</HI> Meekne&s;s. Each of the&s;e may
be &s;til'd, by way of eminence, the Character in the&s;e Heroes.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Characters cannot be alone. 'Tis ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary
that &s;ome other &s;hould give them a lu&s;tre, and embelli&s;h
them as far as they are capable: Either by hiding the defects that
are in each, by &s;ome noble and &s;hining Qualities; as the Poet has
done the Anger of <HI>Achilles,</HI> by &s;hading it with an extraordinary
Valour: Or by making them entirely of the nature of a true
and &s;olid Virtue, as is to be ob&s;erv'd in the two others. The Di&s;&s;i|mulation
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is a part of his Prudence; and the Meekne&s;s
of <HI>Aeneas</HI> is wholly employ'd in &s;ubmitting his Will to the Gods.
For the making up this Union, our Poets have joyn'd together
&s;uch Qualities as are by nature the mo&s;t compatible; <HI>Valour</HI> with
<HI>Anger, Meekne&s;s</HI> with <HI>Piety,</HI> and <HI>Prudence</HI> with <HI>Di&s;&s;imulation.</HI> This
la&s;t Union was nece&s;&s;ary for the Goodne&s;s of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>; for without
that, his Di&s;&s;imulation might have degenerated into Wickedne&s;s
and Double-dealing.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Machi|nery.</NOTE> WE come now to the <HI>Machines</HI> of the Epic Poem. The chief
Pa&s;&s;ion which it aims to excite being <HI>Admiration,</HI> nothing is &s;o
conducive to that as the <HI>Marvellous</HI>; and the importance and dig|nity
of the Action is by nothing &s;o greatly elevated as by the
<HI>Care and Interpo&s;ition of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Machines are of three &s;orts. Some are <HI>Theological,</HI> and
were invented to explain the nature of God. Others are <HI>Phy&s;ical,</HI>
and repre&s;ent things of Nature. The la&s;t are <HI>Moral,</HI> and are the
Images of Virtues and Vices.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> and the Ancients have given to their Deities the Man|ners,
Pa&s;&s;ions and Vices of Men. Their Poems are wholly Alle|gorical;
and in this view it is ea&s;ier to defend <HI>Homer</HI> than to blame
him. We cannot accu&s;e him for making mention of many Gods,
for his be&s;towing Pa&s;&s;ions upon them, or even introducing them
fighting again&s;t men. The Scripture u&s;es the like figures and
expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiii" REF="33">
If it be allowable to &s;peak thus of the Gods in <HI>Theology,</HI> much
more in the Fictions of <HI>Natural Philo&s;ophy,</HI> where if a Poet de|&s;cribes
the Deities, he mu&s;t give them &s;uch Manners, Speeches,
and Actions as are conformable to the nature of the things they
repre&s;ent under tho&s;e Divinities. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame in <HI>Moral</HI>
Deities: <HI>Minerva</HI> is wi&s;e, becau&s;e &s;he repre&s;ents Prudence; <HI>Venus</HI>
is both good or bad, becau&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love is capable of
the&s;e contrary qualities.</P>
<P>Since among the Gods of a Poem &s;ome are good, &s;ome bad,
and &s;ome indifferently either; and &s;ince of our Pa&s;&s;ions we make
&s;o many allegorical Deities; one may attribute to the <HI>Gods</HI> all that
is done in the Poem, whether good or evil. But the&s;e Deities do
not act con&s;tantly in one and the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>Sometimes they act invi&s;ibly, and by meer In&s;piration; which
has nothing in it extraordinary or miraculous: being no more
than what we &s;ay every day, <Q REND="inline">"That &s;ome God has a&s;&s;i&s;ted us,
or &s;ome Daemon has in&s;tigated us."</Q></P>
<P>At other times they appear vi&s;ibly, and manife&s;t them&s;elves to
men, in a manner altogether miraculous and praeternatural.</P>
<P>The third way has &s;omething of both the others: It is in truth
a miracle, but is not commonly &s;o accounted: This includes
Dreams, Oracles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e ways mu&s;t be <HI>Probable</HI>; for &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as the Mar|vellous
is to the Epic Action, as nothing is &s;o conducive to Ad|miration;
yet we can on the other hand admire nothing that we
think impo&s;&s;ible. Tho' the Probability of the&s;e Machines be of
a very large extent, (&s;ince 'tis founded upon Divine Power) it
is not without limitations. There are numerous In&s;tances of al|lowable
and probable Machines in the Epic Poems, where the
Gods are no le&s;s Actors than the Men. But the le&s;s credible &s;ort,
&s;uch as <HI>Metamorpho&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. are far more rare.</P>
<P>This &s;ugge&s;ts a Reflection on the Method of rendring tho&s;e
Machines probable, which in their own nature are hardly &s;o.
Tho&s;e which require only <HI>Divine Probability,</HI> &s;hould be &s;o di&s;engag'd
from the Action, that one might &s;ub&s;tract them from it with|out
de&s;troying the Action. But tho&s;e which are e&s;&s;ential and
nece&s;&s;ary, &s;hould be grounded upon <HI>Human Probability,</HI> and not
<PB N="xxiv" REF="34">
on the &s;ole Power of God. Thus the Epi&s;odes of <HI>Circe,</HI> the <HI>Sy|rens,</HI>
<HI>Polyphemus,</HI> &amp;c. are nece&s;&s;ary to the Action of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI>
and yet not humanly probable: Yet <HI>Homer</HI> has artificially re|duc'd
them to human Probability, by the Simplicity and Igno|rance
of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> before whom he cau&s;es tho&s;e recitals to
be made.</P>
<P>The next Que&s;tion is, Where, and on what occa&s;ions Ma|chines
may be u&s;ed? It is certain <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> make u&s;e of
them every where, and &s;carce &s;uffer any Action to be perform'd
without them. <HI>Petronius</HI> makes this a Precept: <HI>Per ambages, de|orumque
mini&s;teria</HI> &amp;c. The Gods are mention'd in the very <HI>Pro|po&s;ition</HI>
of their Works, the <HI>Invocation</HI> is addre&s;t to them, and
the whole <HI>Narration</HI> is full of them. The Gods are the <HI>Cau&s;es</HI>
of the Action, they form the <HI>Intrigue,</HI> and bring about the <HI>So|lution.</HI>
The precept of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Horace,</HI> that the unravelling
of the Plot &s;hould not proceed from a Miracle or the appear|ance
of a God, has place only in Dramatic Poetry, not in the
Epic. For it is plain that both in the Solution of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> the Gods are concern'd: In the former, the Deities meet
to appea&s;e the Anger of <HI>Achilles</HI>: <HI>Iris</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> are &s;ent to
that purpo&s;e, and <HI>Minerva</HI> eminently a&s;&s;i&s;ts <HI>Achilles</HI> in the deci|&s;ive
combate with <HI>Hector.</HI> In the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> the &s;ame Godde&s;s fights
clo&s;e by <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> again&s;t the Suitors, and concludes that Peace be|twixt
him and the <HI>Ithacen&s;ians,</HI> which compleats the Poem.</P>
<P>We may therefore determine, that a Machine is not an In|vention
to extricate the Poet out of any difficulty which embarra&s;|&s;es
him: But that the Pre&s;ence of a Divinity, and &s;ome Action &s;ur|prizing
and extraordinary, are in&s;erted into almo&s;t all the parts of his
work, in order to render it more Maje&s;tic and more Admirable.
But this mixture ought to be &s;o made, that the Machines might be
retrench'd without taking any thing from the Action. At the
&s;ame time it gives the Readers a le&s;&s;on of Piety and Virtue; and
teaches them, that the mo&s;t brave and the mo&s;t wi&s;e can do no|thing,
and attain nothing great and glorious, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of Heaven. Thus the Machinery crowns the whole work, and
renders it at once, <HI>Marvellous, Probable,</HI> and <HI>Moral.</HI></P>

<HEAD><PB N="35" REF="67">OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
FIRST BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>_WE &s;hall proceed in the &s;ame method thro' the
cour&s;e of the&s;e Annotations upon the <HI>O|dy&s;&s;ey,</HI>
as in tho&s;e upon the <HI>Iliad</HI>; con&s;idering
<HI>Homer</HI> chiefly as a Poet, endeavouring to
make his beauties <HI>under&s;tood,</HI> and not to
prai&s;e without a rea&s;on given. It is equally
an extreme, on the one hand to think <HI>Ho|mer</HI>
has no human defects; and on the other
to dwell &s;o much upon tho&s;e defects, as to depreciate his beauties.
The greater part of Criticks form a general character, from the
ob&s;ervation of particular errors, taken in their own oblique or im|perfect
views; which is as unju&s;t, as to make a judgment of the
beauty of a man's body from the &s;hadow it happens to ca&s;t, in
&s;uch or &s;uch a po&s;ition. To convince the Reader of this intend|ed
impartiality, we readily allow the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> to be inferior to the
<HI>Iliad</HI> in many re&s;pects. It has not that &s;ublimity of &s;pirit, or
that enthu&s;ia&s;m of poetry; but then it mu&s;t be allow'd, if it be
le&s;s noble, it is more in&s;tructive: The other abounds with
more Heroi&s;m, this with more Morality. The <HI>Iliad</HI> gives us a
draught of Gods and Heroes, of di&s;cord, of contentions, and
<PB N="36" REF="68">
&s;cenes of &s;laughter; the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> &s;ets before us a &s;cene more amia|ble,
the land&s;chapes of nature, the plea&s;ures of private life, the du|ties
of every &s;tation, the ho&s;pitality of ancient times; a le&s;s bu&s;y,
but more agreeable portrait. The <HI>Iliad</HI> concludes with the ruin,
the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> with the happine&s;s of a nation. <HI>Horace</HI> was of the
&s;ame opinion, as is evident from the epi&s;tle to <HI>Lollius.</HI><Q><L><HI>Seditione, dolis, &s;celere, libidine, &amp; ira,</HI></L>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 1. <L><HI>The Man, for Wi&s;dom,</HI> &amp;c.]</L></Q> <HI>Homer</HI> opens his Poem
with the utmo&s;t &s;implicity and mode&s;ty; he continually grows
upon the reader,
<Q><L><HI>Non fumum ex fulgore, &s;ed ex fumo dare lucem</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cogitat, ut &s;pecio&s;a dehinc miracula promat.</HI></L></Q>
<HI>Cicero</HI> lays this down as a rule for the Orator, <HI>principia vere|cunda,
non elatis inten&s;a verbis</HI>; and <HI>Horace</HI> for the Poet, <HI>Nec &s;ic
incipies, &amp;c.</HI> He propo&s;es the beginning of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> as a pattern
for all future poems, and has tran&s;lated them in his Art of poetry.
<Q><L><HI>Dic mihi, Mu&s;a, virum, captae po&s;t tempora Trojae,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Qui mores hominum multorum vidit, &amp; urbes.</HI></L></Q>
May I be forgiven the arrogance, if I &s;hould offer a critici&s;m
upon this tran&s;lation? The <HI>&s;ufferings</HI> of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> are the &s;ubject of
the whole <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> and yet <HI>Horace</HI> has omitted the mention of
tho&s;e &s;ufferings: <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">. There is another
word al&s;o which &s;eems e&s;&s;ential, that is, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, this is
likewi&s;e omitted. For the &s;ufferings of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and the wi&s;dom
by which he extricated him&s;elf from them, enter into the very
<PB N="37" REF="69">
de&s;ign of the Poem. But indeed in another place he has plainly
had regard to all the&s;e circum&s;tances,
<Q><L><HI>Qui</HI> domitor Trojae, <HI>multorum</HI> providus <HI>urbes</HI></L>
<L><HI>Et mores hominum in&s;pexit, latumque per aequor</HI></L>
<L><HI>Dum</HI> &s;ibi<HI>, dum</HI> &s;ociis<HI>, reditum parat,</HI> a&s;pera multa</L>
<L>Pertulit&mdash;</L><BIBL><HI>Epi&s;t. ad Loll.</HI></BIBL></Q>
I mu&s;t al&s;o refute a critici&s;m of <HI>Rapin,</HI> who will have it that the
word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> includes a character of craft and low cun|ning,
unworthy of a brave &s;pirit: But <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> admirably vin|dicates
the Poet in this re&s;pect, he &s;hews us that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> no
where in <HI>Homer</HI> &s;ignifies (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">) or Morals; and that it implies
a man who could accommodate him&s;elf to every condition of
life; one who in the wor&s;t e&s;tate had &s;till a re&s;erve to free him|&s;elf
from it; it therefore, &s;ays he, &s;ignifies a man that thro' expe|rience
has learn'd wi&s;dom. I have likewi&s;e the authority of <HI>Ho|race</HI>
for this &s;en&s;e, in the above-cited pa&s;&s;age,
<Q><HI>Qui domitor Trojae multorum</HI> providus <HI>urbes.</HI></Q>
I take <HI>providus</HI> in this place to &s;ignify not only a man who noted
the manners of various nations with care, but al&s;o one who
in calamity could fore&s;ee methods to extricate him&s;elf from it.
And &s;urely nothing can be more unju&s;t than what <HI>Rapin</HI> objects
again&s;t <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> in employing his wi&s;dom only in his own pre&s;er|vation,
while all his companions were lo&s;t: <HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf &s;uffi|ciently
refutes this objection, and directly tells us, that he em|ployed
his wi&s;dom in the care of their &s;afety, but that they thro'
their folly defeated his wi&s;dom. The words of <HI>Homer,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Eu|&s;tathius,</HI>
&s;hew that a wi&s;e man neglects not his friends in adver&s;i|ty.
But, &s;ays <HI>Rapin,</HI> what could oblige <HI>Homer</HI> to begin with &s;o
di&s;honourable an action, and place the greate&s;t weakne&s;s of his
Heroe in the very fronti&s;piece of his Poem? and invoke his Mu&s;e
to &s;ing the man who with difficulty &s;aved him&s;elf, and &s;uffer'd his
companions to be de&s;troy'd? There had been &s;ome weight in this
<PB N="38" REF="70">
objection, if <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> had &s;aved his own, with the lo&s;s of their lives;
but I cannot &s;ee any di&s;honour, in his pre&s;erving him&s;elf by wi&s;|dom,
when they de&s;troy'd them&s;elves by folly: It was chiefly by
&s;torms that they peri&s;h'd; it can be no imputation to his
character, not to be able to re&s;train the effects of a tempe&s;t:
he did all that a wi&s;e man cou'd do, he gave them &s;uch admoniti|ons
upon every emergency, that if they had pur&s;ued them, they
had been pre&s;erved as well as <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI></P>

in relation to this Epithet <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, given to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI>
is worth tran&s;cribing. The Fable of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> (&s;ays he) is whol|ly
for the conduct and policy of a State: Therefore the quality
it requires is <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> but this virtue is of too large an extent
for the &s;implicity which a ju&s;t and preci&s;e <HI>character</HI> requires; it
is therefore requi&s;ite it &s;hould be limited. The great art of Kings
is the my&s;tery of <HI>Di&s;&s;imulation.</HI> 'Tis well known, that <HI>Lewis</HI> the
eleventh, for the in&s;truction of his Son, reduc'd all the <HI>Latin lan|guage</HI>
to the&s;e words only, <HI>viz. Qui ne&s;cit di&s;&s;imulare ne&s;cit reg|nare.</HI>
'Twas likewi&s;e by this practice that <HI>Saul</HI> began his reign,
when he was fir&s;t elected and as yet full of the &s;pirit of God.
The fir&s;t thing we read of him in holy Writ is, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ille vero di&s;&s;imulabat &s;e audire.</HI> Reg. lib. 1.</NOTE> that he made as
if he did not hear the words which &s;editious people &s;poke again&s;t
him.</P>
<P>This then is the <HI>character</HI> which the <HI>Greek</HI> Poet gives his <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>
in the Propo&s;ition of his Poem, he calls him <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">;
to denote this prudent di&s;&s;imulation, which di&s;gui&s;ed him
&s;o many ways, and put him upon taking &s;o many &s;hapes.</P>
<P>Without mentioning any thing of <HI>Circe,</HI> who detain'd him
with her a whole year, and who was famous for the transforma|tions
&s;he made of all &s;orts of per&s;ons; the reader finds him at
fir&s;t with <HI>Calyp&s;o</HI> the daughter of wi&s;e <HI>Atlas,</HI> who bore up the
va&s;t pillars that reach'd from Earth to Heaven, and who&s;e know|ledge
penetrated into the depths of the unfathomable Ocean: that
<PB N="39" REF="71">
is to &s;ay, who was ignorant of nothing in Heaven, Earth,
or Sea. And as the fir&s;t product and principal part of &s;o
high, &s;o &s;olid, and &s;o profound a knowledge was to know
how to conceal ones &s;elf; this wi&s;e man call'd his daughter by a
name that &s;ignified a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE><HI>&s;ecret.</HI> The Poet makes his Heroe, whom
he de&s;igned for a Politician, to &s;tay &s;even whole years with this
Nymph. She taught him &s;o well, that afterwards he lo&s;t no op|portunity
of putting her le&s;&s;ons in practice: for he does nothing
without a di&s;gui&s;e. At his parting from <HI>Ogygia</HI> he is ca&s;t upon
the I&s;le of <HI>Phaeaca:</HI> as kind as his reception was, yet he &s;tays 'till
the night before he went off ere he wou'd di&s;cover him&s;elf. From
thence he goes to <HI>Ithaca:</HI> the fir&s;t adventure that happen'd to
him there was with <HI>Minerva,</HI> the mo&s;t prudent among the Dei|ties,
as <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> was the mo&s;t prudent among men. She &s;ays &s;o
expre&s;sly in that very pa&s;&s;age. Nor did they fail to di&s;gui&s;e them|&s;elves.
<HI>Minerva</HI> takes upon her the &s;hape of a &s;hepherd, and <HI>U|ly&s;&s;es</HI>
tells her he was oblig'd to fly from <HI>Crete,</HI> becau&s;e he had
murder'd the &s;on of King <HI>Idomeneus.</HI> The Godde&s;s di&s;covers her
&s;elf fir&s;t, and commends him particularly, becau&s;e the&s;e artifices
were &s;o ea&s;ie and natural to him, that they &s;eem'd to be born
with him. Afterwards the Heroe under the form of a beggar de|ceives
fir&s;t of all <HI>Eumeus,</HI> then his &s;on, and la&s;t of all his wife,
and every body el&s;e, till he found an opportunity of puni&s;hing
his Enemies, to whom he di&s;cover'd not him&s;elf 'till he kill'd them,
namely on the la&s;t night. After his di&s;covering him&s;elf in the
Palace, he goes the next day to deceive his father, appearing at

Since <HI>Atlas</HI> or <HI>Enoch</HI> had prophecy'd of the Deluge, and

<HI>Rapin</HI> has rais'd &s;everal objections again&s;t this piece of conduct in
<HI>Homer</HI>: He tells us that the action of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> is imperfect,
that it begins with the voyages of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and ends with tho&s;e
<PB N="49" REF="81">
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>: That the four fir&s;t books are all concerning <HI>Tele|machus:</HI>
That his voyage bears no proportion to that of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI>
that it contributes nothing to his return, which is brought about
by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Phaeacians</HI>; that this gave
occa&s;ion to <HI>Beni</HI> in his <HI>academical di&s;cour&s;es</HI> to a&s;&s;ert, that the
Fable of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> is double, that the four fir&s;t books of it are
neither Epi&s;ode, nor part of an action, nor have any connexion
with the re&s;t of the work.</P>
<P>I am of opinion, that the&s;e objections are made with too
great &s;everity; The de&s;truction of the Suitors is the chief hinge
upon which the Poem turns, as it contributes chiefly to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in his country and regality; and whatever
contributes to this end, contributes to the principal action, and
is of a piece with the re&s;t of the Poem; and that this voyage
does &s;o is evident, in that it gives a defeat to the Suitors, and
controuls their in&s;olence; it pre&s;erves <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>'s throne and bed invi|olate,
in that it gives <HI>Telemachus</HI> courage to re&s;i&s;t their attempts:
It &s;ets his character in a fair point of light, who is the &s;econd
per&s;onage of the Poem, and is to have a great &s;hare in the future
actions of it.</P>
<P><HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erves, that <HI>Homer</HI> here prepares the
way for the defeat of the Suitors, the chief de&s;ign of his Poem;
and lays the ground-work of probability on which he intends to
build his Poem, and reconcile it to the rules of credibility.</P>
<P>If it be ask'd for what end this voyage of <HI>Telemachus</HI> is made;
the an&s;wer is, to enquire after <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>: So that whatever Epi&s;odes
are interwoven, <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is &s;till in view; and whatever <HI>Telemachus</HI>
acts, is undertaken &s;olely upon his account; and con&s;equently,
whatever is acted, contributes to the principal de&s;ign, the re&s;to|ration
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI> So that the Fable is entire, and the Action not
double.</P>
<P>'Tis to be remember'd al&s;o, that the &s;ufferings of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> are
the &s;ubject of the Poem; his per&s;onal calamities are not only in|tended,
but his dome&s;tic misfortunes; and by this conduct <HI>Ho|mer</HI>

duty, or nature, have moved his heart toward an ab&s;ent fa|ther?
The Machine, adds he, has not the lea&s;t appearance of
probability, ina&s;much as the Godde&s;s conducts him to every
place, except only where <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> re&s;ides; of which &s;he ought by no

<P>But &s;urely nothing can be be more natural, than for a &s;on, in

places, and of tho&s;e per&s;ons, where and from whom he is mo&s;t
likely to have information. Such is the conduct of <HI>Telemachus:</HI>
And Poetry, which delights in the Wonderful, becau&s;e this conduct
agrees with wi&s;dom, a&s;cribes it to <HI>Minerva</HI> the Godde&s;s of it.
No doubt but <HI>Minerva</HI> knew where <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> re&s;ided: but men
mu&s;t act as men: &s;uch an immediate interpo&s;ition as <HI>Rapin</HI> re|quires,
had &s;topp'd at once the fountain of the Poet's invention.

ON THE
SECOND BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="note">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS book opens with the fir&s;t appearance
of <HI>Telemachus</HI> upon the &s;tage of action. And
<HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI> ob&s;erves the great judgment of the
Poet, in beginning with the tran&s;actions of
<HI>Ithaca</HI> in the ab&s;ence of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> By this
method he &s;ets the conduct of <HI>Telemachus,</HI>
<HI>Penelope,</HI> and the Suitors, in a &s;trong point
of light; they all have a large &s;hare in the
&s;tory of the Poem, and con&s;equently ought to have di&s;tingui&s;h|ing
characters. It is as nece&s;&s;ary in Epic Poetry, as it is on the
Theatre, to let us immediately into the character of every per&s;on
whom the Poet introduces: This adds per&s;picuity to the &s;tory,
and we immediately grow acquainted with each per&s;onage, and
intere&s;t our &s;elves in the good or ill fortune that attends them
thro' the whole relation.</P>
<P><HI>Telemachus</HI> is now about twenty years of age: In the eleventh
book, the Poet tells us, he was an infant in the arms of his mo|ther
when <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> &s;ail'd to <HI>Troy</HI>; that Heroe was ab&s;ent near twenty
<PB N="98" REF="127">
years, and from hence we may gather the exact age of <HI>Telema|chus.</HI>
He is every where de&s;crib'd as a per&s;on of piety to the Gods,
of duty to his parents, and as a lover of his country: he is pru|dent,
temperate, and valiant: and the Poet well &s;ets off the im|portance
of this young Heroe, by giving him the Godde&s;s of
War and Wi&s;dom for his con&s;tant attendant.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 13.&mdash; <L><HI>In his hand a pond'rous javelin &s;hin'd.</HI>]</L></Q> The
Poet de&s;cribes <HI>Telemachus</HI> as if he were marching again&s;t an ene|my,
or going to a council of war, rather than to an a&s;&s;embly
of Peers in his own country: Two rea&s;ons are a&s;&s;ign'd for this
conduct; either this was the common u&s;age of Princes in tho&s;e
times, or <HI>Telemachus</HI> might look upon the Suitors as enemies,
and con&s;equently go to council in arms as again&s;t enemies. <BIBL><HI>Eu&s;tathius.</HI></BIBL></P>

pa&s;&s;age has not e&s;cap'd the raillery of the Critics; they look upon
it as a mean de&s;cription of a Heroe and a Prince, to give him a
brace of dogs only for his guards or attendants: But &s;uch was
the &s;implicity of ancient Princes, that except in war they had
rarely any attendants or equipage. And we may be confident,
<HI>Homer</HI> copies after the cu&s;tom of the time, unle&s;s we can be &s;o
ab&s;urd as to &s;uppo&s;e, he would feign low circum&s;tances unnece&s;&s;a|rily,
thro' a want of judgment.</P>

<P>Poetry, ob&s;erves <HI>Dacier,</HI> is like Painting, which draws the
greate&s;t beauties from the &s;imple&s;t cu&s;toms: and even in hi&s;tory,
we receive a &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure from the lea&s;t circum&s;tance that de|notes
the cu&s;toms of ancient times. It may be added, that
the Poet, as well as the Painter, is obliged to follow the cu&s;toms
of the age of which he writes, or paints: a modern dre&s;s would
ill become <HI>Achilles</HI> or <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> &s;uch a conduct would be condemned
as an ab&s;urdity in painting, and ought to be &s;o in poetry.</P>

<HI>Antiphus</HI>; (for it is the Poet who relates it, and not the father;)
whence, as <HI>Dacier</HI> ob&s;erves, &s;hould he learn it? he only laments him,

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 33. <L><HI>Since great</HI> Uly&s;&s;es<HI>, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> We are here told,
that there never had been any council conven'd in <HI>Ithaca,</HI> &s;ince
the departure of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI> The general de&s;ign and moral of the
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> is to inform us of the mi&s;chievous effects which the Ab|&s;ence
of a King and Father of a family produces: We deprive, as
<HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI> ob&s;erves, the Poem of its very &s;oul, and &s;poil the Fable,
if we retrench from it the di&s;orders which the Suitors create in
the ab&s;ence of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> both in his family and dominions. No|thing
can give us a greater image of tho&s;e di&s;orders, than what
<PB N="100" REF="129">
is here related: What mu&s;t a kingdom &s;uffer in twenty years,
without a Ruler, without a Council to make Laws or puni&s;h
enormities? Such is the condition of <HI>Ithaca: Laertes</HI> is &s;uperan|nuated;
<HI>Penelope</HI> oppre&s;s'd by the violence of the Suitors; and
<HI>Telemachus</HI> to this time, in his minority.</P>
<P>It is very artful in the Poet to open the a&s;&s;embly by <HI>Aegyptius:
Telemachus</HI> was the per&s;on who conven'd it; and being the great|e&s;t
per&s;onage pre&s;ent, it might be expected that he &s;hould open
the de&s;ign of it: But to give <HI>Telemachus</HI> courage, who was young
and inexperienc'd, <HI>Aegyptius</HI> fir&s;t ri&s;es, and by prai&s;ing the per&s;on
who had &s;ummon'd them (of whom he &s;eems ignorant) gives <HI>Te|lemachus</HI>
to under&s;tand he has friends among the a&s;&s;embly: This
he could no other way &s;o &s;afely have done, con&s;idering the
power of the Suitors. By this means, <HI>Telemachus</HI> is encouraged
to &s;peak boldly, and arraign the di&s;orders of the Suitors with
the utmo&s;t freedom.</P>

<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 54. <L><HI>Your Father, and your King.</HI>]</L></Q> <HI>Telemachus</HI> here &s;ets
the character of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> as a King, in the mo&s;t agreeable point of
light: He rul'd his people with the &s;ame mildne&s;s as a father rules
his children. This mu&s;t needs have a very happy effect upon
the audience; not only as it &s;hews <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to have been a good
Governour; but as it recalls the memory of the happine&s;s they
receiv'd from that mild government, and obliquely condemns them
of ingratitude who had forgot it. By this method al&s;o the Poet
intere&s;ts us deeply in the &s;ufferings of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>; we cannot &s;ee
a good man and good King in di&s;tre&s;s, without the mo&s;t tender
emotions.</P>

the di&s;order of his family than the lo&s;s of his father; yet this

whole po&s;terity, again&s;t the &s;ingle per&s;on of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>But what chiefly takes away this objection is, that <HI>Telemachus</HI> was
&s;till in hopes of his father's return: for <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> does not im|ply
nece&s;&s;arily his death, but ab&s;ence: and then both with ju&s;tice
and decency, <HI>Telemachus</HI> may &s;ay that he grieves more for the

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 63. <L><HI>Scarce all my herds their luxury &s;uffice.</HI>]</L></Q> This
pa&s;&s;age is ridicul'd by the Critics; they &s;et it in a wrong light,
and then grow very plea&s;ant upon it: <HI>Telemachus</HI> makes a &s;ad
outcry becau&s;e the Suitors eat his &s;heep, his beeves, and fatted
goats; and at la&s;t falls into tears. The truth is, the riches of
Kings and Princes, in tho&s;e early ages, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in flocks
and cattle; thus <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> are de&s;crib'd as tending
their flocks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and <HI>Abraham</HI> in the &s;criptures, as abounding
in this kind of wealth.</P>
<P>The&s;e Critics would form a different idea of the &s;tate and
condition of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> if they con&s;ider'd that he had been capa|ble
to maintain no fewer than an hundred and eight per&s;ons in a
manner very expen&s;ive for many years; for &s;o many (with their
attendants) were the Suitors, as appears from the 16th book;
and at the &s;ame time he kept up the dignity of his own court,
and liv'd with great ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>But it is a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to the objections again&s;t this
pa&s;&s;age, to ob&s;erve, that it is not the expence, but manner of
it, that <HI>Telemachus</HI> laments: This he expre&s;ly declares by the
word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">; and &s;urely a &s;ober man may complain again&s;t
luxury, without being arraigned of meanne&s;s; and again&s;t pro|fu&s;ion,

the in&s;olence of the Suitors, and the di&s;orders they create in

ON THE
THIRD BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="note">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Scene is now remov'd from <HI>Ithaca</HI> to
<HI>Pylos,</HI> and with it a new vein of Poetry is
opened: In&s;tead of the riots of the Suitors,
we are entertain'd with the wi&s;dom and
piety of <HI>Ne&s;tor.</HI> This and the following
book are a kind of Supplement to the <HI>Iliad</HI>;
the nature of Epic poetry requires that &s;ome|thing
&s;hould be left to the imagination of
the Reader, nor is the picture to be entirely drawn at full
length. <HI>Homer</HI> therefore, to &s;atisfie our curio&s;ity, gives an
account of the fortunes of tho&s;e great men, who made &s;o
noble a figure at the &s;iege of <HI>Troy.</HI> This conduct al&s;o
&s;hews his art: Variety gives life and delight; and it is
much more nece&s;&s;ary in Epic than in Comic or Tragic Poetry
&s;ometimes to &s;hift the Scenes, to diver&s;ify and embelli&s;h the &s;tory.
But as on the &s;tage the Poet ought not to &s;tep at once from one
part of the world to a too remote country, (for this de&s;troys credi|bility,
and the auditor cannot fancy him&s;elf this minute here, and
the next a thou&s;and miles di&s;tant) &s;o in Epic Poetry, every re|moval
<PB N="158" REF="185">
mu&s;t be within the degrees of probability. We have here
a very ea&s;y tran&s;ition; the Poet carries his Heroe no further than
he really might &s;ail in the compa&s;s of time he allots for his voyage.
If he had &s;till dwelt upon the di&s;orders of the Suitors without inter|ruption,
he mu&s;t grow tire&s;ome; but he artfully breaks the thread
of their Hi&s;tory with beautiful incidents and Epi&s;odes, and re|&s;erves
the further recital of their di&s;orders for the end of his Po|em:
By this method we &s;it down with fre&s;h appetite to the en|tertainment,
and ri&s;e at la&s;t not cloy'd, but &s;atisfied.</P>

of the Suitors: that great Cata&s;trophe is manag'd by few
hands, and it might &s;eem incredible that &s;o few could de&s;troy &s;o

frequently inculcates the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Pallas,</HI> which mu&s;t at lea&s;t
&s;hew that &s;uch a great exploit is not impo&s;&s;ible to be executed by

that all the <HI>Greeks</HI> would ri&s;e in the cau&s;e of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI> What the Suitors
had &s;poken &s;coffingly in the preceding book, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Telemachus</HI>
was &s;ailing to <HI>Pyle</HI> or <HI>Sparta</HI> for <HI>&s;upplies,</HI> appears in this not to
be impracticable; &s;o that it was choice and not nece&s;&s;ity that de|termin'd
the Poet to make u&s;e of no &s;uch ea&s;y expedients for the
de&s;truction of the Suitors. <BIBL><HI>Eu&s;tathius.</HI></BIBL></P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="195">
It may be added, that the very nature of Epic Poetry, and of
the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> in particular, requires &s;uch a conduct: In the <HI>Iliad
Achilles</HI> is the chief agent, and performs almo&s;t all the great actions;
<HI>Aeneas</HI> is painted after the &s;ame manner by <HI>Virgil</HI>; the one kills
<HI>Hector,</HI> the other <HI>Turnus,</HI> both which are the deci&s;ive actions: It
was equally nece&s;&s;ary to exalt the character of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> by bringing
him into difficulties from which he is per&s;onally to extricate him|&s;elf:
This the Poet &s;ufficiently brings about by refu&s;ing all the
ea&s;y methods for his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, becau&s;e the more difficult
ways are mo&s;t conducive to the honour of his Heroe: Thus as
<HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Aeneas</HI> kill <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Turnus</HI> with their own hands, &s;o
the Suitors fall chiefly by the hand of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary for
the Heroe of the Poem to execute the deci&s;ive action, for by this
method the Poet compleats his character, his own greatne&s;s &s;ur|mounts
all difficulties, and he goes off the &s;tage with the utmo&s;t
advantage, by leaving a noble character upon the mind of the

'Tis true, the Poet makes <HI>Minerva</HI> her&s;elf correct it; but yet the

&s;ince the Poet him&s;elf condemns it, we may give it up as an in|decency
in <HI>Telemachus</HI>; it is natural for men in de&s;pair (and that
was the condition of <HI>Telemachus</HI>) to u&s;e a vehemence of expre&s;&s;i|on,
and this might tran&s;port <HI>Telemachus</HI> beyond the bounds of
prudence. The only po&s;&s;ible way that occurs to me to take off
the impiety is to have recour&s;e to De&s;tiny: It was the opinion
of the Antients, that the Gods could not alter De&s;tiny: and then
<HI>Telemachus</HI> may mean no more, than that it was decreed by the

take this opportunity to obviate an objection that may be made
again&s;t all interpo&s;ition of the Gods in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Heroes of the
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey:</HI> It has been thought by &s;ome Critics a di&s;paragement to
them to &s;tand in continual need of &s;uch &s;upernatural &s;uccour: If
two per&s;ons were engaged in combat, and a third per&s;on &s;hould
immediately &s;tep in to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one of the parties and
kill the adver&s;ary, would it not reflect upon the valour of his
friend who was &s;o weak as to want &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance? Why, for in|&s;tance,
&s;hould <HI>Jupiter</HI> help <HI>Aeneas</HI> to kill <HI>Turnus?</HI> Was not he brave
enough to fight, and &s;trong enough to conquer his enemy by his
own prowe&s;s? and would not <HI>Turnus</HI> have kill'd <HI>Aeneas</HI> with the &s;ame
a&s;&s;i&s;tance? It is therefore a di&s;paragement to the actors, thus con|tinually
to &s;upply the defects of a Heroe, by the power of a Deity.</P>
<P>But this is a fal&s;e way of arguing, and from hence it might
be infer'd that the love and favour of a Deity &s;erves only to make
tho&s;e whom he a&s;&s;i&s;ts, and tho&s;e who depend upon &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
appear weak, impotent, cowardly, and unworthy to be conque|rors.
Can any doubt ari&s;e whether the love and favour of a God
be a di&s;paragement or honour to tho&s;e whom he favours? Ac|cording
to the&s;e Critics, we &s;hould find the character of a per|fect
Heroe in an impious <HI>Mezentius,</HI> who acknowledges no God
but his own arm and his own &s;word: 'Tis true, the objection
would be ju&s;t if the Heroe him&s;elf perform'd nothing of the
action; or if when he were almo&s;t conquer'd by the &s;uperior va|lour
of his enemy, he ow'd his life and victory to Gods
<PB N="179" REF="206">
and Miracles: But the Heroe always behaves him&s;elf in all his
actions, as if he were to gain &s;ucce&s;s without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
the Deity; and the pre&s;ence of the Gods is &s;o order'd, that we
may retrench every thing that is miraculous, without making
any alteration in the action or character of the human per&s;ona|ges.
Thus in the in&s;tance of <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Turnus,</HI> tho' <HI>Jupiter</HI> fa|vours
<HI>Aeneas,</HI> yet <HI>Aeneas</HI> is painted in &s;tronger colours of forti|tude,
he appears &s;uperior, as a man una&s;&s;i&s;ted, and able to conquer
<HI>Turnus</HI>; and con&s;equently the favour of <HI>Jupiter</HI> makes no altera|tion
in the action or character of <HI>Aeneas.</HI></P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e a wide difference between the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a
Man, and of a God: The actions of men belong only to the
performers of tho&s;e actions, but when a Deity a&s;&s;i&s;ts us by in|&s;piring
us with &s;trength and courage, the actions we perform are
really our own, and the more he favours us the more glory he
gives us: &s;o that the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of man eclip&s;es, but the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
a God exalts, our glory. Thus for in&s;tance, when <HI>Achilles</HI> is
pur&s;uing <HI>Hector,</HI> he charges the <HI>Greeks</HI> to keep off from <HI>Hector</HI>;
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance might le&s;&s;en his glory: but when <HI>Pallas</HI> offers her
a&s;&s;i&s;tance he immediately embraces it as an honour, and boa&s;ts of it
as &s;uch to <HI>Hector.</HI> I have been large upon this objection, becau&s;e
the Reader ought to carry it in his memory thro' the whole Po|em,
and apply it to every action, in which any &s;hare is a&s;cribed
to any Deity. See <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI> more at large concerning this objection.</P>

<PB N="248" REF="275">
(the fifteenth to the twentieth inclu&s;ively) are taken from the 18th
book of the <HI>Iliads,</HI> and in&s;erted very improperly in this place by
<HI>Ari&s;tarchus. Athenaeus</HI> gives &s;everal rea&s;ons for his opinion, as that
mu&s;ic and dancing were very contrary to the &s;evere manners of
the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI>; be&s;ides the dance was a <HI>Cretan</HI> dance, how
then could it be practis'd among the <HI>Spartans?</HI> The Poet men|tions
neither the name of the Bard, nor one word of the &s;ub|ject
of the &s;ongs: neither can the words <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">,
be apply'd at all to the Dancers, but to the Mu&s;icians; and la&s;t|ly,
it is not to be imagin'd that <HI>Telemachus</HI> and <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus</HI> &s;hould
be &s;o unpolite, as not to be at all affected with the mu&s;ic, had
there been any, and yet break out into &s;uch wonder at the &s;ight
of the beauty of the Palace of <HI>Menelaus. Ari&s;tarchus,</HI> adds he,
thought the de&s;cription of the wedding of the &s;on and daughter
of a King was too meanly and conci&s;ely de&s;crib'd, and therefore
made this addition.</P>
<P>But it is ea&s;y to refute <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> and vindicate <HI>Ari&s;tarchus. A|thenaeus</HI>
under&s;tood <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in the wrong &s;en&s;e, they
are of the imperfect, <HI>he was &s;ending,</HI> or <HI>about to &s;end,</HI> and
not <HI>had &s;ent,</HI> &amp;c. If the marriage had been ab&s;olutely fini&s;h'd,
why &s;hould <HI>Minerva</HI> ab&s;ent her &s;elf from <HI>Menelaus,</HI> when the ce|lebration
of the nuptials is the only rea&s;on of the ab&s;ence of
that Godde&s;s? and as for mu&s;ic and dancing being contrary to
the &s;evere manners of the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> this is all conjecture:
<HI>Menelaus</HI> lived more than three hundred years before <HI>Lycurgus</HI>;
and becau&s;e &s;uch diver&s;ions were forbid in <HI>Sparta</HI> in the days of
<HI>Lycurgus,</HI> mu&s;t it follow that they were not u&s;ed in tho&s;e of <HI>Me|nelaus?</HI>
And &s;hould it be granted that mu&s;ic and dancing were
not u&s;ed in his times, might he not relax a little from the &s;e|verity
of his times, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion of joy as the marriage
of a &s;on and daughter? I am &s;ure the&s;e diver&s;ions are not more
contrary to the &s;everity of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> than the magnificence of
the Palace of <HI>Menelaus</HI> was to their &s;implicity. <Q REND="inline">"But he does
not name the Bard, or the &s;ubject of his &s;ongs":</Q> But is this
a rea&s;on why the ver&s;es are &s;purious? we &s;hould rather admire
the judgment of the Poet, who having &s;o fair an opportunity to
<PB N="249" REF="276">
de&s;cribe the&s;e nuptials, yet rejects the temptation, di&s;mi&s;&s;es the whole
in a few lines, and follows where his &s;ubject leads him. The obje|ction
about the dance being <HI>Cretan</HI> is not more valid: <HI>Menelaus</HI>
(as we learn from the preceding book) had been in <HI>Crete,</HI> and
might bring it thence to <HI>Lacedaemon.</HI> And as for the Critici&s;m
upon <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> it is but a fallacy; <HI>Ca&s;aubon</HI> has &s;hewn beyond
contradiction, that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> is apply'd indifferently to all tho&s;e
who give example to others; and con&s;equently may be apply'd to
Dancers as well as Mu&s;icians. It may be further added, that al|though
it &s;hould be allow'd that the word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> is only pro|perly
apply'd to mu&s;ic, yet in this place the word would not be

or chu&s;e tho&s;e &s;ongs, to which they de&s;ired to dance; as is the

<P><HI>Diodorus</HI> is of opinion, that the whole twelve lines after the

writes that in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and chiefly at <HI>Heliopolis,</HI> the &s;ame with

that even in his time the women of <HI>Dio&s;polis</HI> were able to
calm the rage of grief or anger by certain potions. Now whe|ther
this be truth or fiction, it fully vindicates <HI>Homer,</HI> &s;ince a

But that there may be &s;omething more than fiction in this is very

<P>It is further &s;aid of <HI>Thon,</HI> that he was King of <HI>Canopus,</HI> and
entertain'd <HI>Menelaus</HI> ho&s;pitably before he had &s;een <HI>Helen</HI>; but after|wards
falling in love with her, and offering violence, he was &s;lain

that &s;he fell in love with him, that <HI>Polydamna</HI> growing jealous

her from the poi&s;on of &s;erpents there frequent, which from

the Daemon, not <HI>Helen,</HI> that is in fault; this, continues <HI>Eu&s;tathius,</HI>
an&s;wers many objections that lye again&s;t <HI>Helen</HI>; for if &s;he was a

to deceive the <HI>Greeks,</HI> by the di&s;gui&s;e of her voice, into more mi|&s;ery
than had yet ari&s;en from a ten years war? Or indeed is it
credible that any per&s;on could modulate her voice &s;o artfully as
to re&s;emble &s;o many voices? And how could the <HI>Greeks</HI> enclo&s;ed
in the wooden hor&s;e believe that their wives who were in <HI>Greece,</HI>
could be arriv'd in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace as they had been conceal'd
there, from the various regions of <HI>Greece,</HI> and meet together in
<HI>Troy?</HI> Would the wives of the&s;e Heroes come into an enemy's
country, when the whole army, except the&s;e latent Heroes, were
retir'd from it? this is ridiculous and impo&s;&s;ible. I mu&s;t confe&s;s
there is great weight in the&s;e objections: But <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> an&s;wers
all by the interpo&s;ition of the Daemon; and by an idle tradition
that <HI>Helen</HI> had the name of <HI>Echo,</HI> from the faculty of mimicking
&s;ounds; and that this gift was be&s;tow'd upon her by <HI>Venus</HI> when
&s;he married <HI>Menelaus,</HI> that &s;he might be able to detect him if he
&s;hould prove fal&s;e to her bed, by imitating the voice of the &s;u&s;pected
per&s;on: (but <HI>Menelaus</HI> had more occa&s;ion for this faculty than <HI>Helen.</HI>)
As for the excu&s;e of the Daemon, it equally excu&s;es all crimes: For
in&s;tance, was <HI>Helen</HI> fal&s;e to <HI>Menelaus?</HI> The Daemon occa&s;ion'd it:
Does &s;he act an impo&s;ture to de&s;troy all her <HI>Grecian</HI> friends, and even
<HI>Menelaus?</HI> The Daemon compells her to it: The Daemon compells
her to go with <HI>Deiphobus,</HI> to &s;urround the hor&s;e thrice, to &s;ound the
<PB N="262" REF="289">
&s;ides of it, to endeavour to &s;urprize the latent <HI>Greeks</HI> by an imi|tion
of the voices of their wives, and in &s;hort, to act like a per|&s;on
that was very &s;incere in mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><HI>Dacier</HI> takes another cour&s;e, and gives up <HI>Helen,</HI> but remarks
the great addre&s;s of <HI>Menelaus. Helen</HI> had, &s;aid &s;he, long de|&s;ired
nothing &s;o much as to return to <HI>Lacedaemon</HI>; and her
heart had long been wholly turn'd to <HI>Menelaus: Menelaus</HI> is not
at all convinc'd of this pretended &s;incerity; but it would have
been too gro&s;s, after he had taken her again to his bed, to con|vict
her of fal&s;hood: He therefore contents him&s;elf barely to re|ply
that &s;ome Daemon, an enemy to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> had forc'd her to
a conduct di&s;agreeable to her &s;incerity. This (continues <HI>Dacier</HI>)
is an artful, but &s;evere Irony.</P>
<P>As for the objection concerning the impo&s;&s;ibility of the <HI>Greeks</HI>
believing their wives could be in <HI>Troy</HI>; &s;he an&s;wers, that the Au|thors
of this objection have not &s;ufficiently con&s;ider'd human na|ture.
The voice of a belov'd per&s;on might of a &s;udden, and by
&s;urprize, draw from any per&s;on a word involuntary, before he has
time to make reflection. This undoubtedly is true, where cir|cum&s;tances
make an impo&s;ture probable; but here is an impo&s;&s;i|bility;
it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible to believe the wives of the&s;e He|roes
could be in <HI>Troy.</HI> Be&s;ides, <HI>Menelaus</HI> him&s;elf tells us, that
even he had fallen into the &s;nare, but <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> prevented it; this
adds to the incredibility of the &s;tory, for if this faculty of mi|mickry
was given upon his marriage with <HI>Helen,</HI> it was nothing
new to him, he mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd to be acquainted with it, and
con&s;equently be the le&s;s liable to &s;urprize: Nay it is not impo&s;|&s;ible,
but the experiment might have been made upon him be|fore
<HI>Helen</HI> fled away with <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, I think this pa&s;&s;age wants a further vindication: the
circum&s;tances are low, if not incredible. <HI>Virgil,</HI> the great imitator
of <HI>Homer,</HI> has given us a very different and more noble de&s;cri|ption
of the de&s;truction of <HI>Troy:</HI> he has not thought fit to imi|tate
him in this de&s;cription.</P>

If we allow <HI>Helen</HI> to act by compul&s;ion, to have fear'd the

yet this is no vindication of her conduct: &s;he &s;till acts a mean

betray and ruin the <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall ju&s;t add, that after the death of <HI>Paris, Helen</HI> married

It may be ask'd whence this conjecture of the Suitors ari&s;es? <HI>Pe|nelope</HI>
is de&s;crib'd as weeping grievou&s;ly, and fainting away, and
yet immediately the Suitors conclude &s;he is preparing for the

the Queen had purify'd her &s;elf with water, and
&s;upplicated the Godde&s;s <HI>Minerva,</HI> tho' the Poet omits the rela|tion
of &s;uch little particularities. But whence is it that the Po|et
gives a greater &s;hare of wi&s;dom to <HI>Euryclea</HI> than to <HI>Penelope?
Penelope</HI> commands a &s;ervant to fly with the news of the ab&s;ence
of <HI>Telemachus</HI> to <HI>Laertes,</HI> which could not at all advantage <HI>Tele|machus,</HI>
and only grieve <HI>Laertes: Euryclea</HI> immediately diverts her
from that vain intention, advi&s;es her to have recour&s;e to heaven, and
not add mi&s;ery to the already mi&s;erable <HI>Laertes:</HI> This is Wi&s;dom
in <HI>Euryclea.</HI> But it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd that the other is Nature in
<HI>Penelope: Euryclea</HI> is calm, <HI>Penelope</HI> in a pa&s;&s;ion: and <HI>Homer</HI>
would have been a very bad painter of human Nature, if he
had drawn <HI>Penelope</HI> thus heated with pa&s;&s;ion in the mild temper
of <HI>Euryclea</HI>; grief and re&s;entment give <HI>Penelope</HI> no time to deli|berate,

<L><HI>Impre&s;t the form,</HI> &amp;c.]</L></Q>
We have here an imaginary Being introduc'd by the Poet: The
whole is manag'd with great judgment; It is &s;hort, becau&s;e it has
not a direct and immediate relation to the progre&s;s of the Poem,
and becau&s;e &s;uch imaginary entercour&s;es have ever been looked
upon as &s;udden in appearance, and as &s;udden in vani&s;hing away.
The u&s;e the Poet makes of it, is to relieve <HI>Penelope</HI> from the ex|tremity
of de&s;pair, that &s;he may act her part in the future &s;cenes
with courage and con&s;tancy. We &s;ee it is <HI>Minerva</HI> who &s;ends this
phantom to <HI>Penelope</HI> to comfort her: Now this is an allegory to
expre&s;s that as &s;oon as the violence of &s;orrow was over,
the mind of <HI>Penelope</HI> return'd to &s;ome degree of tranquilli|ty:
<HI>Minerva</HI> is no more than the re&s;ult of her own refle|ction
and wi&s;dom, which bani&s;h'd from her brea&s;t tho&s;e me|lancholy
apprehen&s;ions. The manner likewi&s;e of its intro|duction
is not le&s;s judicious; the mind is apt to dwell upon
tho&s;e objects in &s;leep which make a deep impre&s;&s;ion when
awake: This is the foundation of the Poet's fiction; it is
<PB N="278" REF="305">
no more than a dream which he here de&s;cribes, but he cloaths it
with a body, gives it a momentary exi&s;tence, and by this method
exalts a low circum&s;tance into dignity and Poetry.</P>

We ought not to reproach <HI>Penelope</HI> for this &s;eemingly &s;hock|ing
declaration, in preferring a &s;on to an husband: Her &s;enti|ment
is natural and ju&s;t; &s;he had all the rea&s;on in the world to

mu&s;t unavoidably touch her with the highe&s;t degree of &s;en&s;ibili|ty;
if he is lo&s;t, &s;he can have recour&s;e to no &s;econd comfort. But

the &s;tory: The que&s;tion is very natural for an affectionate wife

was from the &s;ilence of <HI>Homer</HI> as to the exact time of his
&s;tay, which was of no importance, being di&s;tingui&s;h'd by no
