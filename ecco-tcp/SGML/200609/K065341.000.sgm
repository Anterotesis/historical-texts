<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE following <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> was writ|ten to in&s;truct all &s;ober and &s;erious Per&s;ons, how to pre|&s;erve, or regain their Health; but chiefly to direct and relieve my <HI>Fellow-&s;ufferers,</HI> the <HI>Scorbutic, Gouty, Con&s;umptive,</HI> or <HI>Nervous</HI> Valetudinarian-low-livers; to make them pa&s;s their Lives the mo&s;t com|fortably, the <HI>Degree</HI> of their Di&s;tem|pers, the <HI>Time</HI> of Life, the <HI>Nature</HI> of Things, and the &s;ecret Orders of <HI>Provi|dence,</HI> will permit. And &s;ince they mu&s;t be deprived, in &s;ome Degree, of the <HI>gro&s;&s;er</HI> &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures; &s;ince all &s;en|tient and <HI>intelligent</HI> Beings are made for Happine&s;s, will by mere <HI>In&s;tinct,</HI> &s;eek it <HI>&s;ome-how,</HI> and &s;ome-where; &s;ince their nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Low-living</HI> will na|turally
<PB N="ii" REF="5">
(in time at lea&s;t) make them <HI>high-&s;pirited,</HI> and their <HI>intellectual Or|gans</HI> more acute, <HI>penetrating,</HI> and <HI>de|licate</HI>; I have endeavour'd, by the fol|lowing <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> to &s;upply them with &s;ome &s;uitable <HI>Entertainments</HI> and <HI>Amu&s;e|ments,</HI> &s;uch as I have often agreeably diverted my lei&s;ure Hours with.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>True Philo&s;ophy</HI> is the <HI>Science</HI> of living the mo&s;t happily, through the whole <HI>Period</HI> of our Exi&s;tence, the Na|ture of things will permit; <HI>Phy&s;ic</HI> is but one Branch of this <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> and regards but one part of our Compo&s;ition, and but for a &s;mall <HI>Period</HI> of our Du|ration. <HI>True Philo&s;ophy</HI> takes in the whole Extent of our Being, from its mo&s;t di&s;tant Beginning, to its mo&s;t advanced Stages, po&s;&s;ible or conceiveable. True Phy&s;ic is that only which directs how the Body may be pre&s;erved the mo&s;t <HI>health|ful,</HI> the intellectual Organs depending on the Body the mo&s;t acute, the <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> the mo&s;t perfect, and the <HI>Limbs</HI> the mo&s;t
<PB N="iii" REF="6">
active; not for a while only, and by Fits and Starts, but uniformly, as long as <HI>they</HI> were made to la&s;t, and as the <HI>original</HI> Frame and Texture will permit: Any thing le&s;s than this, is but as a Part to the Whole; an imperfect and unfini&s;h'd <HI>Sketch</HI> of &s;uch a <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> and &s;uch a <HI>Phy&s;ic,</HI> their Theory and <HI>Principles,</HI> was intended by the following <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> and <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. They were compo&s;ed at different Times, and on different Occa&s;ions; but one general <HI>Scheme,</HI> and one manner of <HI>free philo&s;ophizing,</HI> and <HI>ea&s;y Conjectur|ing,</HI> runs through them all; one, to wit, where the fundamental <HI>Truth,</HI> or <HI>Propo|&s;ition</HI> in general, is &s;uppos'd either <HI>al|low'd, reveal'd,</HI> or already <HI>demon&s;trated.</HI> But the <HI>Why?</HI> the <HI>final Cau&s;es,</HI> the <HI>moral Con&s;equences,</HI> and the particular <HI>De|tail,</HI> is only here conjectured about, from probable or <HI>philo&s;ophic Principles.</HI> This nece&s;&s;arily makes them more <HI>loo&s;e, un|guarded,</HI> and <HI>immethodical,</HI> and the
<PB N="iv" REF="7">
&s;ame things to be often repeated. But I had neither <HI>Lei&s;ure, Reli&s;h,</HI> nor <HI>Strength of Application,</HI> to remedy the&s;e Faults; it would have co&s;t me more <HI>Trouble</HI> than the fir&s;t <HI>Compo&s;ure.</HI> All I could obtain of my&s;elf, was to make a &s;hort, more di&s;tinct <HI>Ab&s;tract</HI> of the whole, and join a few <HI>Explications,</HI> to prevent <HI>Cavil,</HI> and all <HI>Mi&s;takes</HI> not wilful and di&s;ingenuous, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P N="4">4. I am very &s;en&s;ible, by this Work, I &s;hall make my&s;elf obnoxious to two very different kinds of Men, the <HI>Stiff, Rigid,</HI> and <HI>Preci&s;e</HI>; and the <HI>Licentious, Un|guarded, Spurious, Free-Thinkers.</HI> The <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> very probably, will cen&s;ure my <HI>Conjectures</HI> and <HI>Sentiments,</HI> as <HI>dan|gerous,</HI> and <HI>pre&s;umptuous,</HI> and <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> as being <HI>wi&s;e above what is written,</HI> and arrogantly prying into the <HI>Secrets</HI> of in|finit Wi&s;dom. It is very po&s;&s;ible I may have been <HI>faulty,</HI> in this particular. I am &s;en|&s;ible, that &s;ome even undoubted <HI>Truths,</HI> that may hurt the <HI>Weak,</HI> ought to be concealed,
<PB N="v" REF="8">
or enjoy'd only in &s;ecret; the &s;ame Degrees of <HI>Light</HI> not being equally <HI>luminous</HI> and <HI>perceptive</HI> to all Eyes. But &s;ince <HI>old Men,</HI> and Valetudinarians e&s;pecially, be|come, as it were, <HI>Children</HI> a &s;econd time, and, in their <HI>&s;econd Childhood, tho&s;e</HI> mu&s;t have their <HI>Rattles</HI> as well as the&s;e; I thought it &s;afer, as I am &s;ure it is much more entertaining, to play with <HI>Ideas, philo&s;ophic Conjectures,</HI> and &s;uch <HI>Amu&s;ements,</HI> how weakly &s;oever founded, as tend to make <HI>Virtue</HI> and its <HI>Source</HI> ami|able, ju&s;tify the <HI>Conduct of Providence,</HI> and mend and rejoice the <HI>Heart</HI> without hurting the <HI>Head,</HI> than to dwell on the dark Side of Things, that lead to <HI>Pyrrhoni&s;m, Fatali&s;m, Infidelity,</HI> and <HI>De&s;pair.</HI> If I thought I had advanced any thing <HI>dero|gatory</HI> from the <HI>Amiablene&s;s</HI> of infinit Perfection, <HI>contrary</HI> to the Doctrine of the earlie&s;t and pure&s;t Times of <HI>Chri|&s;tianity, contradictory</HI> to the <HI>Analogy</HI> of Faith, and the <HI>Form of &s;ound Words,</HI> I had committed the&s;e <HI>Sheets</HI> to the <HI>Flames,</HI> with the <HI>Hand</HI> of their <HI>Author,</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="9">
before I had publi&s;hed them. But, on the contrary, I hoped they might agree|ably entertain my <HI>Valetudinarian,</HI> who being placed by his low Health, in the <HI>middle State,</HI> between both <HI>Worlds,</HI> the <HI>old</HI> and the <HI>new,</HI> mu&s;t unavoidably, at &s;ome times, <HI>figure</HI> to him&s;elf &s;ome &s;ort of a <HI>Map</HI> of the next World. I was therefore willing to try to <HI>illuminat</HI> it, the be&s;t I could, and to trace &s;ome of the <HI>Out-lines</HI> of the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ages</HI> from <HI>this</HI> to <HI>that Man|&s;ion</HI>; by endeavouring to <HI>illu&s;trat,</HI> from not &s;o common a Set of <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> &s;ome great and fundamental <HI>Truths,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd on more <HI>popular Proofs,</HI> viz. that there is no Po&s;&s;ibility of Happine&s;s here or hereafter, without <HI>Purity</HI> of <HI>Heart</HI> and <HI>Life</HI>; and that the true <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of the pre&s;ent <HI>Darkne&s;s,</HI> both in <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Revelation,</HI> is the Difficulty of recovering this <HI>Pu|rity of Heart and Life,</HI> to its utmo&s;t Perfection, in free <HI>lap&s;ed</HI> Intelligences, con&s;i&s;tent with their <HI>Liberty,</HI> and the <HI>Harmony</HI> of the Divine Attributes,
<PB N="vii" REF="10">
which infinit <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> will not, I might &s;ay, cannot, counter act.</P>
<P N="5">5. I apprehend le&s;s Quarter from the oppo&s;it <HI>Set</HI> of Men, who may honour me with <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m, Romanceing,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;tle-building,</HI> without any &s;olid Foun|dation. All I have to &s;ay is, that per|haps my Manner of explaining &s;ome great and fundamental Truths, and a few of the Con&s;equences I draw by my <HI>Method,</HI> may be defective: And perhaps, from &s;ome of the <HI>Links</HI> being dropt, and from Faults in the <HI>wording,</HI> the <HI>Chain</HI> of the Rea&s;oning may not be always <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>&s;trong</HI>; but I am &s;ure the <HI>Foundation</HI> is <HI>&s;olid</HI> and <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> and allow'd to be &s;uch by all <HI>true Philo&s;ophers</HI>; and without it, all <HI>general</HI> and <HI>ab&s;tracted</HI> Rea&s;oning (on the&s;e <HI>imperceptible</HI> Subjects) mu&s;t be vain; I mean, without admitting <HI>Ana|logy:</HI> For without &s;uppo&s;ing the Evidence and Probability of it, (it being in <HI>Things</HI> only, what <HI>Proportion</HI> is in <HI>Numbers,</HI> and its <HI>Progre&s;&s;ions</HI> being only
<PB N="viii" REF="11">
like the higher and &s;ub&s;equent Terms of a <HI>Series</HI> in <HI>Algebra,</HI> from &s;ome of the fir&s;t and &s;imple&s;t <HI>Terms</HI> being given) no <HI>general Laws,</HI> nor <HI>univer&s;al Propo&s;i|tions,</HI> can be found out, in <HI>Mathema|ticks, Philo&s;ophy,</HI> or <HI>Morality.</HI> For <HI>Induction,</HI> either in <HI>Experiment, Ob|&s;ervation,</HI> or <HI>Calculation,</HI> mu&s;t be al|ways <HI>particular</HI> and limited. Perhaps the <HI>Method,</HI> when managed by a <HI>clearer Head,</HI> and a more <HI>&s;olid Judgment,</HI> may become a noble <HI>Source</HI> of <HI>divine Know|ledge,</HI> and a <HI>&s;ublime Philo&s;ophy. Ma|thematicians</HI> well know, that there are &s;everal different <HI>Methods</HI> of inve&s;tigating the &s;ame Propo&s;itions in <HI>Algebra</HI> and <HI>Geometry</HI>; and there is &s;carce a <HI>Geo|meter,</HI> but has his own <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>In|ve&s;tigation.</HI> The &s;ame Conclu&s;ions, drawn from different demon&s;trated <HI>Truths,</HI> give a &s;en&s;ible <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> and a &s;tronger <HI>Con|viction,</HI> to an hone&s;t Heart, and a Lover of Truth; and I could not but be de|lighted with the <HI>Univer&s;ality, Simplicity,</HI> and <HI>Luminou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Method</HI> of
<PB N="ix" REF="12">
<HI>Analogy,</HI> and the other Principles I have laid down in the following <HI>Di&s;|cour&s;es,</HI> not having met with an <HI>Ob|jection, Difficulty,</HI> or even a <HI>Puzzle</HI> al|mo&s;t, in <HI>Nature, Providence,</HI> or <HI>Reve|lation,</HI> which had not an ea&s;y, con&s;equen|tial or probable Solution from them, which is, at lea&s;t, a Prejudice in their Favour. I had nothing to do, but to try the <HI>Diffi|culty,</HI> in its mo&s;t &s;imple and obvious Ca&s;es, (as I u&s;ed to do in <HI>Algebra,</HI> to find out <HI>univer&s;al Canons</HI>) and atten|tively to ob&s;erve the Conditions of the <HI>Progre&s;&s;ion,</HI> till the higher Terms in|volved the Complication.</P>
<P N="6">6. There are &s;ome Per&s;ons made &s;o by <HI>Nature,</HI> that they are <HI>&s;low, dark, gloomy, joyle&s;s, puzzling,</HI> and <HI>perplexing,</HI> and they pa&s;s for the wi&s;e, prudent, guarded Men of the <HI>World:</HI> They may attack <HI>Error,</HI> but &s;eldom find out <HI>Truth</HI> by them&s;elves; like the <HI>Scuttle-fi&s;h,</HI> they &s;pout out their own <HI>black Liquor</HI> on the <HI>pellucid Element.</HI> If they are <HI>hone&s;t</HI>
<PB N="x" REF="13">
and <HI>&s;incere,</HI> they are much to be pitied, and are to be treated with <HI>Humanity</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> being in the State of tho&s;e born <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>blind,</HI> and &s;o de&s;titute of the Nece&s;&s;aries and Conveniencies of Life. They mu&s;t do the be&s;t they can, and be charitably &s;upplied, and with Docility be willing to be led by others; and thus, tho' their Trial might be <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>&s;evere,</HI> yet their Victory would be <HI>merito|rious</HI> and <HI>glorious.</HI> But, on the contrary, it often happens, that <HI>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, Self-&s;ufficiency,</HI> and a &s;upercilious Con|tempt of others, are the true Cau&s;es of their <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Indigence,</HI> and that they have them&s;elves, by wrong or no Cul|ture, &s;tunted the <HI>Organs</HI> of their Facul|ties, and by a perpetual <HI>Mal-regimen</HI> have di&s;torted them.</P>
<P N="7">7. I take <HI>common Happine&s;s,</HI> in our natural State at pre&s;ent, to lie in the Pur&s;uit of the general Mea&s;ures of Think|ing, Acting and Living, follow'd by the greate&s;t part of the middling Rank of
<PB N="xi" REF="14">
our <HI>Species</HI> (as it is in their Order in other <HI>Animals</HI>); and <HI>common Sen&s;e</HI> (as it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from culti|vated and refin'd Sen&s;e) to lie in a&s;&s;ent|ing and conforming to the <HI>Truths</HI> and <HI>Manners,</HI> agreed upon explicitly or im|plicitly, in the <HI>Community</HI> where Pro|vidence has placed us, without &s;ome <HI>irre|&s;i&s;tible,</HI> that is, <HI>miraculous</HI> Evidence, or a <HI>peaceable, &s;ilent,</HI> and not <HI>inter|meddling</HI> Self-conviction to the contrary. And he who pretends to be <HI>happy,</HI> as to his outward Circum&s;tances, out of <HI>com|mon Life,</HI> or <HI>wi&s;e</HI> as to intellectual En|dowments, out of <HI>common Sen&s;e,</HI> in Things on a Level with his <HI>Occupation</HI> and <HI>Education</HI>; I take him always to labour under &s;ome undi&s;cover'd <HI>chronical nervous</HI> Di&s;temper, be the other Appear|ances what they will, and have been &s;el|dom mi&s;taken in a <HI>particular Ca&s;e.</HI> For tho' a <HI>&s;ound Mind</HI> be not the <HI>only</HI> &s;ure Evidence of a <HI>&s;ound Body,</HI> yet it will always &s;hew, that none of the great <HI>Organs</HI> of Life is intirely &s;poilt, or greatly <HI>damaged,</HI> however tender and
<PB N="xii" REF="15">
delicate they may be. It is more difficult, than perhaps mo&s;t Men are aware of, to determin, with any Degree of Exactne&s;s, the <HI>Limits</HI> that &s;eparat <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> from <HI>Folly, Wrong-headedne&s;s</HI> from <HI>intel|lectual Sanity</HI>; the mo&s;t perfect Man here has a <HI>Mixture</HI> of both: <HI>Optimus ille, qui minimis urgetur.</HI> Certain it is, that <HI>true Wi&s;dom,</HI> and a <HI>&s;ound Mind,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in fir&s;t <HI>pondering,</HI> and then <HI>doing,</HI> every thing as near as we can, with <HI>Order, Number, Weight</HI> and <HI>Mea&s;ure:</HI> But &s;ince <HI>Preci&s;ion</HI> is incom|patible with <HI>Finitude,</HI> if we endeavour to be con&s;tantly <HI>progre&s;&s;ive</HI> towards Per|fection, tho' by gentle Steps, neither &s;top|ping nor turning a&s;ide, but doing the be&s;t we can without <HI>Scrupulo&s;ity,</HI> and gene|rou&s;ly hopeing and believeing, that infinit Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s has, or will &s;upply the <HI>re&s;t,</HI> in his own Time and Manner, <HI>we cannot fail.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Were I to <HI>choo&s;e</HI> for my&s;elf, con|&s;idering the many certain <HI>Mi&s;eries</HI> and
<PB N="xiii" REF="16">
Temptations of this State of <HI>Probation,</HI> the <HI>few</HI> uncertain <HI>Antidotes,</HI> and much <HI>fewer</HI> &s;incere, durable, and real <HI>Plea|&s;ures</HI>; I had much rather have the weaker, than the &s;tronger <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of Nerves, within the <HI>Extremes.</HI> I had rather choo&s;e to be contented with the <HI>&s;light</HI> and <HI>&s;lender,</HI> than covet the &s;trong and <HI>pungent</HI> Plea&s;ures. I had rather be happy in a <HI>Dream,</HI> than mi&s;erable <HI>awake.</HI> In a word, I had rather choo&s;e to be an innocent, benevolent, tho' weaker and more <HI>credulous</HI> Per&s;on, than a <HI>malicious, critical, &s;purious Free-think|er,</HI> even with regard to this Life only. They mo&s;t certainly are, <HI>comparatively, unhappy</HI> and <HI>joyle&s;s</HI> in them&s;eves, and are <HI>unharmoniou&s;ly</HI> fram'd, in <HI>Body</HI> as well as <HI>Mind,</HI> who can delight, and employ their <HI>Talents,</HI> on throwing <HI>Dark|ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Doubts</HI> even on the imaginary Happine&s;s (&s;uppo&s;e it &s;uch) of their <HI>Fellow-Creatures:</HI> Nothing but <HI>Ran|cour,</HI> and <HI>acrid Juices,</HI> could be plea&s;ed with tearing and de&s;troying <HI>Childrens</HI>
<PB N="xiv" REF="17">
<HI>Play-things</HI>; and the wi&s;e&s;t Man here is comparatively but a <HI>Child.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. As to my&s;elf, I can <HI>hone&s;tly affirm,</HI> I have had but <HI>one</HI> uniform manner of thinking in <HI>Philo&s;ophy, Phy|&s;ic,</HI> and <HI>Divinity,</HI> in the main, ever &s;ince my Thoughts were <HI>fix'd,</HI> and my Principles <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h'd:</HI> They may have had <HI>Alterna|tives</HI> of greater <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Darkne&s;s,</HI> occa&s;ionally and tran&s;iently, according to the <HI>State</HI> of my <HI>Spirits, Knowledge,</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI>; but in the <HI>Heart of my Soul</HI> (&s;o to &s;peak) I have been uni|form, and under the &s;ame <HI>Convictions,</HI> as to the <HI>Fundamentals</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Sciences</HI>; and always thought <HI>&s;purious Free-Thinkers, active Latitudinarians,</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tolic Infidels,</HI> (it being a Contra|diction they can be certain in their <HI>Ne|gative</HI> Opinions, or by them when propa|gated, &s;hould do any Good to their Fellow-Creatures, but an infinit deal of Hurt) under &s;ome ob&s;tinat bodily Di&s;temper, and much more proper Subjects for <HI>Me|dicin</HI>

In the due and proportional Union of the&s;e, do the Va|riety and Difference of animal Sub&s;tances con|&s;i&s;t. Now it is pa&s;t all Doubt in Philo&s;ophy, and in philo&s;ophical <HI>Chemy,</HI> that <HI>animal Sub|&s;tances</HI> of mo&s;t kinds, po&s;&s;e&s;s in a much greater Proportion the <HI>two fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e Principles, <HI>viz.

The <HI>Jelly,</HI> the Juice or Chyle of <HI>animal</HI> Sub&s;tances, is
<PB N="57" REF="150">
infinitely more tenacious and glewy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Memoirs of the Academy Royal for 1729 and 1730.</NOTE>, and its la&s;t Particles more clo&s;ely united, and &s;epa|rated with greater Difficulty, than tho&s;e of <HI>vegetable</HI> Sub&s;tances.

A Piece of Meat will continue &s;weet and &s;ound, for many Years in Wine or &s;trong Beer, or in any &s;trong fermented Liquor; the Liquor cementing and pinning to|gether the Parts of the Meat; and the &s;ame hap|pens when they are mixed in the Stomach; by which the <HI>Dige&s;tibility</HI> and ea&s;y Di&s;&s;olution of it, is ob&s;tructed; &s;o that in &s;uch a Mixture <HI>Mutton</HI> is turned into <HI>Beef,</HI> and <HI>Beef</HI> into <HI>Shoe-Leather.</HI> 2.

This is evident from the U&s;e commonly made of &s;trong Beer, as the be&s;t Plai&s;ter for <HI>Sprains, Relaxations</HI> and <HI>Strains</HI>; and that Brandy will really &s;top <HI>Hae|morrhages</HI> and Ruptures in the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els,
<PB N="68" REF="161">
by burning and wrinkling the tender Fibres and Capillaries, and &s;o by this cri&s;ping Quality mu&s;t keep Food from being readily and per|fectly dige&s;ted. 3.

<P N="4"><PB N="233" REF="326">4. OF this general <HI>Analogy</HI> between the <HI>&s;piritual</HI> and <HI>material Sy&s;tems,</HI> there are many <HI>Traces</HI> plainly to be di&s;cern'd by an acute and <HI>contemplative Philo&s;opher.</HI> To in&s;tance only in the Similitude which our <HI>&s;olar Sy&s;tem,</HI> as now di&s;order'd, bears to the <HI>lap&s;ed Intelligences</HI> that inhabit it. In the Centre of this <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> is plac'd the <HI>Sun,</HI> a bright and lively Image of the <HI>Deity,</HI> his ma|terial inanimat <HI>Miniature</HI>; the <HI>Planets</HI> and other <HI>cele&s;tial Orbs</HI> revolving about him at their re&s;pective Di&s;tances, and performing their Revolutions in different <HI>Periods</HI> of Time, will repre&s;ent the &s;everal <HI>Orders</HI> of lap&s;ed In|telligences, the different Degrees of their <HI>Lap&s;e,</HI> and the Duration and Continuance of their <HI>probatory</HI> State. This glorious Body, the <HI>Sun,</HI> infinitly &s;urpa&s;&s;es all the other <HI>Orbs</HI> in Magnitude and Lu&s;tre; they are no more, compar'd to him, than Points in the <HI>Circum|ference</HI> of a <HI>Circle.</HI> They have no Brightne&s;s of their own; it is all deriv'd by <HI>Reflection,</HI> and is more or le&s;s, according to their Di&s;tance from him.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE chief Properties of the <HI>Sun</HI> are <HI>Attraction, Light</HI> and <HI>Heat.</HI> The <HI>Sun</HI>'s <HI>Attraction</HI> extends to the remote&s;t Parts of the <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> acting at all Di&s;tances, with a <HI>Force</HI> increa&s;ing in a certain Proportion as the&s;e Di&s;tances decrea&s;e. 'Tis by this <HI>At|traction</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="327">
that the <HI>Planets</HI> are retain'd in their <HI>Orbits,</HI> and kept from flying off in the <HI>Tan|gent,</HI> to which their <HI>projectile</HI> Force gives them a con&s;tant Tendency. Should the <HI>Sun</HI>'s <HI>Attraction</HI> cea&s;e but a Moment, the whole <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> would fall into the utmo&s;t Di&s;order, and be irrecoverably ruin'd. How like is this <HI>Attraction</HI> to the <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> continually operating upon all created <HI>Intelligences,</HI> and powerfully &s;olliciting them to a nearer Ap|proach and Re&s;emblance to Him&s;elf! Its In|fluence is con&s;tant and invariable; were it po&s;|&s;ible it &s;hould have the lea&s;t Intermi&s;&s;ion, the whole <HI>Creation</HI> would fall into utter Ruin and De&s;truction.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE <HI>Light</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> is diffus'd through|out the whole <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI>; no <HI>Cele&s;tial</HI> Body is endow'd with this Quality but him&s;elf. This is an <HI>Image</HI> of that <HI>Light which enlightens every Man that comes into the World</HI>; an <HI>Emblem</HI> of Him who came forth from the <HI>Father of Lights</HI>; the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Sun</HI> of the new <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and of <HI>&s;piritual Nature.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. THE <HI>Sun</HI>'s Light is always accompanied with Heat, the Principle of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Vege|tation.</HI> In the other cele&s;tial Bodies there is &s;ome &s;mall Degree of this Quality, but it is originally deriv'd from or produc'd in them by the <HI>&s;olar Heat</HI>; without which they would be barren and inho&s;pitable <HI>De&s;arts.</HI> This
<PB N="235" REF="328">
repre&s;ents the Influences of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> which are in&s;eparable from the <HI>Light</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI>; and are the Principle of our <HI>&s;piritual Life,</HI> animating and cheri&s;hing every intel|ligent Being, and making it productive of all the Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="8">8. LET us next con&s;ider the Properties of the <HI>Planets,</HI> and other Bodies that revolve about the <HI>Sun.</HI> Their various <HI>Magnitudes</HI> and <HI>Di&s;tances</HI> from the <HI>Sun,</HI> with the <HI>perio|dical</HI> Times of their Revolution, will expre&s;s the &s;everal <HI>Orders</HI> of <HI>lap&s;ed Intelligences,</HI> the different Degrees of their <HI>Lap&s;e,</HI> and the par|ticular <HI>Periods</HI> of Time allotted for their Trial and <HI>Probation.</HI> Some of the&s;e Bodies, as the <HI>Comets,</HI> move in <HI>Orbits</HI> that are very <HI>Ellyp|tical,</HI> going off to immen&s;e Di&s;tances from the <HI>Sun,</HI> where the Influence of his <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> is almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible; but by the Force of his <HI>Attraction</HI> they are again drawn back, and brought even to a nearer Approach than other Bodies that move in narrower <HI>Orbits.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. THE <HI>Planets</HI> are con&s;tantly acted upon by two different Forces, <HI>viz. Gravity</HI> or <HI>At|traction,</HI> and the <HI>projectile</HI> Force. The&s;e are contrary to one another, and always act in oppo&s;ite Directions; the <HI>projectile</HI> Force give|ing the <HI>Planet</HI> a con&s;tant Tendency to recede from the <HI>Sun,</HI> and to fly off in the <HI>Tangent</HI>;
<PB N="236" REF="329">
while the Force of <HI>Attraction,</HI> by drawing it the contrary way, prevents that Effect: So that by the joint Action of both, the <HI>Planet</HI> is kept in its <HI>Orbit.</HI> The <HI>attractive</HI> Force, though continually influencing the <HI>Planet,</HI> is not a Quality of it, but proceeds from the <HI>Sun</HI>; the only Quality belonging to the <HI>Planet</HI> is that of the <HI>projectile</HI> Force. This will &s;hadow out the <HI>Lap&s;e,</HI> the Action of <HI>Selfi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> and the inordinate <HI>Love</HI> of the Creature, with their Oppo&s;ition to the <HI>divine Love.</HI></P>

<P><HI>PHILOSOPHERS</HI> tell us, that the pre&s;ent State of our <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> cannot be of long Continuance; but that the <HI>&s;olar Attraction</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily prevail over the <HI>projectile</HI> Force of the <HI>cele&s;tial</HI> Bodies; and all the <HI>Co|mets</HI> and <HI>Planets,</HI> with their <HI>Satellites,</HI> be at la&s;t <HI>ab&s;orb'd</HI> and <HI>&s;wallow'd</HI> up in the <HI>Sun.</HI></P>

<ITEM>That this <HI>primitive, aethereal,</HI> divinely <HI>or|ganiz'd Body,</HI> by an <HI>individual Fitne&s;s</HI> and Congruity to the informing &s;piritual Sub&s;tance, might have been thereby &s;o inti|matly and <HI>commen&s;uratly</HI> united with it, that they could never after be &s;eparated by any finite Power, no more than the <HI>original Particles</HI> of Matter could be divided by &s;uch a Power ibid.</ITEM>
