<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT, By the EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE young Lady who is the writer of the following Poem is a native of London, but was removed, with her Family, in very early life, to a remote part of the kingdom, where her &s;ole in&s;truction was derived from a virtuous, amiable, and &s;en&s;ible mother. In &s;o di&s;tant a &s;ituation, &s;he had &s;uch little acce&s;s to books, that, when the piece now pre&s;ented to the public was written, &s;he had not read Mr. Cartwright's Armine and
<PB N="2" REF="4">
Elvira, Dr. Percy's Hermit of Warkworth, and other beautiful productions of that kind. On her return to the metropolis la&s;t &s;ummer, the Poem being &s;hewn to &s;everal of her ac|quaintance, they earne&s;tly reque&s;ted its pub|lication; to which &s;he hath con&s;ented, with the mode&s;ty and diffidence that, in the &s;ea|&s;on of youth, are the u&s;ual concomitants of true virtue. Having long been intimate with the family, I with plea&s;ure undertook the ta&s;k of Editor; and my plea&s;ure will be greatly increa&s;ed, if this performance &s;hall meet with a favourable reception from the judges of poetical merit. Should there be found in it many marks of an elegant and pathetic genius, to the&s;e not only the candid, but even the judicious critic will direct his principal attention; and will be di&s;po&s;ed to forgive the &s;implicity of the &s;tory, and that
