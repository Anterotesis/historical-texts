<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A SERMON on the &s;ubject of the fir&s;t of the following Di&s;&s;erta|tions, was preached before your Lord|&s;hip, at the Opening of the la&s;t Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly of the Church of Scotland. In the compa&s;s of a <HI>Ser|mon,</HI> the Argument could not be ful|ly treated: but your Candour led
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
you to approve; and, in a very ob|liging manner, you de&s;ired the Pu|blication of it. With that freedom which your affability had invited me to u&s;e in all my intercour&s;e with you, I declined publi&s;hing the Ser|mon, and expre&s;&s;ed my inclination rather to offer to the Public a larger Di&s;&s;ertation on The Manner in which Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles propo&s;ed the evidences of their Mi&s;&s;ion; and to &s;ubjoin to it another Di&s;&s;ertation on a related &s;ubject. You was plea&s;ed both to accept my Apology, and to allow me the honour of prefixing your name to the whole work.</P>
<P>YOUR Lord&s;hip's great Talents and amiable Virtues afford matter for prai&s;e remote from the &s;u&s;picion of adulation. But the ju&s;t prai&s;e of
<PB N="v" REF="4">
them would be offen&s;ive to that Greatne&s;s of Soul, which has always de&s;pi&s;ed an o&s;tentatious di&s;play of them, and to that Mode&s;ty which has added grace to them, by endea|vouring to conceal them. Your De|licacy would not bear &s;o much as an acknowledgment of your Favours to me, in terms &s;uitable to the &s;en&s;e which I have of them; for you ne|ver would allow me, even in private, to mention them as obligations.</P>
<P>BUT if the Di&s;&s;ertations which I now pre&s;ent to your Lord&s;hip, &s;hall in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;wer the purpo&s;e for which they are &s;incerely intend|ed; if they &s;hall point out any Evi|dence for Chri&s;tianity, which has not been hitherto &s;ufficiently regarded; if they &s;hall excite the attention, and
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
convince the judgment of any who may have acquired an habit of inatten|tion to the more common proofs of the divinity of this Religion; or if they &s;hall add any vigour and activity to the Faith of tho&s;e who are already Chri&s;tians: This will be truly agree|able to your Lord&s;hip; and by this you will obtain the end to which your indulgence to the Author, led you to hope that this publication might contribute.

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Evidences of the Chri&s;tian religion, may very properly be di&s;tingui&s;hed into two kinds, the <HI>direct</HI> and the <HI>collateral.</HI> It is on the former of the&s;e that Chri&s;tian writers have be|&s;towed the greate&s;t part of their atten|tion. They are commonly reduced to two heads, <HI>internal</HI> and <HI>external</HI> eviden|ces. Both have been fully illu&s;trated, and frequently urged. The external evidences of Chri&s;tianity are, Miracles, and Prophecy: the&s;e are the directe&s;t proofs of its divinity. Its internal evi|dence, however, has likewi&s;e con&s;ide|rable force; much greater force, it might ea&s;ily be &s;hown, than &s;ome Chri|&s;tian writers have allowed it. This e|vidence
<PB N="x" REF="9">
ari&s;es from its excellence. But when its excellence is urged as a <HI>direct</HI> proof of its truth and divinity, it will be proper to con&s;ider that excellence in reference to the main and principal end of Chri&s;tianity. The want of at|tention to this, has often led Chri&s;tians into gro&s;s perver&s;ions of the doctrines of their religion; and has given occa|&s;ion to many of the objections of Infi|dels again&s;t it, which would be &s;hown at once to be frivolous and imperti|nent, by only a&s;certaining the <HI>kind</HI> of excellence which it is rea&s;onable to de|mand in Chri&s;tianity. We talk at ran|dom concerning the excellence or the defects of any &s;y&s;tem, till we have fir&s;t di&s;covered the preci&s;e end and de&s;ign of that &s;y&s;tem: excellence always con|&s;i&s;ts in the fitne&s;s of a thing for an&s;wer|ing &s;ome determinate end of real im|portance. It is &s;ufficient for rendering any in&s;titution excellent in its kind,
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
that it be adapted to the end which it in fact propo&s;es, tho' there may be ma|ny other ends, very valuable in them|&s;elves, which it has no tendency to promote. The end which Chri&s;tianity profe&s;&s;edly aims at, is the &s;piritual im|provement of mankind, the pre&s;ent vir|tue and comfort, and the future per|fection and happine&s;s, of all who yield them&s;elves up to its power. It keeps this end continually in view; it repre|&s;ents all its doctrines and all its pre|cepts as means of promoting this end; it is careful to &s;et them in that attitude in which they may mo&s;t directly and powerfully contribute to it. Chri&s;tians have not always con&s;idered the go&s;pel in this light; they have not &s;earched it with a de&s;ign only to find food by which their &s;ouls may be nouri&s;hed unto eternal life; but they have &s;ought for what may gratify their curio&s;ity, give an occa&s;ion for di&s;playing their inge|nuity,
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
or countenance refinements in|to which they had previou&s;ly run: and, while they were intent on drawing from the go&s;pel imaginary benefits which it was never de&s;igned to afford, they have too often lo&s;t &s;ight of the real and important advantages of which it is naturally productive. A mi&s;ap|prehen&s;ion of the proper and ultimate end of Chri&s;tianity, and a de&s;ire, con|&s;equent on that mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, of applying it to purpo&s;es remote from its intention, is the &s;ource to which we may trace up mo&s;t of the &s;ubtle and in|tricate di&s;cu&s;&s;ions impo&s;ed on the world, in all ages, as the doctrines of Chri&s;t, and mo&s;t of the frivolous and ab&s;tru&s;e controver&s;ies, which have been agita|ted as que&s;tions very e&s;&s;ential to reli|gion. When Chri&s;tians have thus o|verlooked the de&s;ign of that religion which they profe&s;s to believe, it is no wonder that Infidels have mi&s;taken it
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
too. Their mi&s;take concerning it, is the only foundation of many of their objections. When they hear it a&s;&s;ert|ed, that Chri&s;tianity is excellent, they &s;uppo&s;e that it ought to contribute &s;omething to every end that is valua|ble in any &s;en&s;e, however foreign to its profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign: and if they can think of any purpo&s;e which they are plea&s;ed to reckon de&s;irable, but to which Chri|&s;tianity contributes not, they take it for granted, that this is contrary to ex|cellence, that it is a defect, and an ob|jection again&s;t a divine original. But as the profe&s;&s;ed end of Chri&s;tianity is indi&s;putably mo&s;t important, and what ought to be the ultimate end of all re|ligion, &s;o it is &s;olely by examining its fitne&s;s for promoting this end, that we ought to determine, whether it is excellent or not. If it contains powerful means of virtue, if it af|fords &s;olid grounds of joy, &s;uited
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
to the condition of human creatures, it is excellent; it not only is &s;uch a re|ligion as may have been revealed by God, and ought to be received on a po&s;itive proof that it was revealed by him; but its very &s;tructure indicates that it actually is divine, in a manner &s;imilar to that in which the benign and wi&s;e contrivance of the world, proves it to be the work of God. Ad|mit, that it throws no new light upon any of the &s;ciences, that it corrects not the errors of the vulgar concerning the con&s;titution of nature, that it gives no deci&s;ion in many que&s;tions which &s;peculative men have rai&s;ed concern|ing religion and morality, that it af|fords not the means of gratifying idle curio&s;ity with re&s;pect to all the circum|&s;tances, and motives, and u&s;es of the very di&s;pen&s;ation which it&s;elf brings to light, that it is in no degree &s;ub&s;er|vient to many purpo&s;es very de&s;irable
<PB N="xv" REF="14">
to mankind: A thou&s;and objections of this &s;ort, are of no weight: they are wholly be&s;ide the purpo&s;e; they amount only to this, that Chri&s;tianity promotes not ends which it never had in view: it is &s;ufficient, that it is exactly adapted to its own end: it is from the import|ance of this, and from its fitne&s;s for promoting it, that the proper excel|lence of Chri&s;tianity ari&s;es. Whatever does not either belong to its excellence con&s;idered in this light, or fall under the heads of miracles wrought on pur|po&s;e to atte&s;t it, or of prophecies ful|filled; and yet affords a proof, or any real pre&s;umption, of its truth and di|vinity, is a <HI>collateral</HI> evidence for it. The u&s;e of &s;uch arguments is, either to rou&s;e the inattentive and the preju|diced to a careful and impartial exa|mination of the more direct evidences of the go&s;pel, or to &s;trengthen the con|viction which the&s;e evidences have al|ready
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
produced. To keep it &s;teddily in view, that this is their proper u&s;e, is nece&s;&s;ary for pro&s;ecuting arguments of this kind to the greate&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>IT is a common complaint, e&s;peci|ally concerning &s;ubjects which have been very frequently treated, that they are exhau&s;ted. If the complaint were ju&s;t, it would long ago have been in vain to expect that any thing new &s;hould be advanced with regard to the evidences of the Chri&s;tian religion; for it will be difficult to name a &s;ubject which has been oftener canva&s;&s;ed. But the complaint is generally no more than an excu&s;e for want of genius. It may perhaps be affirmed with truth, that no &s;ubject is &s;o trite, as not to af|ford real genius matter for new di&s;co|veries. There never yet aro&s;e a defen|der of Chri&s;tianity, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of genius, who did not throw additional light up|on
<PB N="xvii" REF="16">
its evidences. Some of the late&s;t writers have confirmed even its direct and principal evidences, by arguments which were not formerly urged, and have &s;et their force in the cleare&s;t light, by happy illu&s;trations which had not occurred to their predece&s;&s;ors. The collateral evidences of the go&s;pel, open a field much more untrodden; and &s;e|veral late writers have &s;hown, that it gives ample &s;cope for the exerci&s;e of invention: they have di&s;covered many pre&s;umptions of the truth of our reli|gion, which had wholly e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation of preceeding writers; and they have pro&s;ecuted others with great accuracy, which before had been but occa&s;ionally hinted, and evinced that they have much greater force than they could have been expected to have. I may add, that authors of penetration, have &s;ugge&s;ted topics which may be improved into conclu&s;ive and &s;triking
<PB N="xviii" REF="17">
arguments for the truth of Chri&s;tianity, even when they have been examining &s;ubjects, and pur&s;uing de&s;igns, very different and &s;eemingly unconnected: <HI>The &s;pirit of Laws,</HI> is a treati&s;e which af|fords many in&s;tances of this. All the collateral evidences of the truth of Chri|&s;tianity are in one &s;en&s;e <HI>internal</HI> evi|dences: they all ari&s;e from &s;ome par|ticulars in the nature of this religion, from &s;ome circum&s;tances which have attended its reception, or &s;prung from it, or from &s;ome remarkable facts con|nected with it, and related in the go|&s;pel hi&s;tory. But even tho&s;e of them, which have been already pro&s;ecuted, are far from being all of preci&s;ely the &s;ame &s;pecies.&mdash;Some of them are in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e internal. That excellence of Chri&s;tianity, which con&s;titutes its in|ternal evidence, may be &s;ufficiently a&s;|certained by an examination of the doctrines and precepts of this religion:
<PB N="xix" REF="18">
an examination of its nature is indeed the direct and proper method of bring|ing its excellence to the trial; and if, on this trial, it be approved, the direct argument thence re&s;ulting for its divi|nity, is completed. If there be any topic from which a proof of its excel|lence can be deduced, additional to, and independent on, what ari&s;es from the examination of its nature, that to|pic may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as afford|ing a &s;eparate and collateral proof of its truth. Of this kind is an argument which was very early urged in favour of the go&s;pel; the argument deduced from its great efficacy, at its fir&s;t ap|pearance, in bani&s;hing polythei&s;m, ido|latry, &s;uper&s;tition, and the arts of ma|gic, and in reforming the tempers and manners of tho&s;e who embraced it. This efficacy gives us new a&s;&s;urance of the excellence of Chri&s;tianity, by &s;how|ing us corre&s;pondent effects actually re|&s;ulting
<PB N="xx" REF="19">
from it; by this it &s;trengthens our belief of its divine original: it like|wi&s;e begets a general pre&s;umption, that there mu&s;t have been very &s;atis|fying evidence of its truth, el&s;e men never would have made &s;o great &s;acri|fices to it.&mdash;Again, tho' the virtue and the &s;piritual good of man, be the only main and ultimate end of Chri&s;tianity, yet it may at the &s;ame time be fit for promoting many other good ends &s;ub|ordinate to this, or con&s;i&s;tent with it. A fitne&s;s for promoting any &s;uch end is a new in&s;tance of the excellence of Chri&s;tianity, di&s;tinct indeed from its proper and e&s;&s;ential excellence, but which &s;trengthens the argument for its divinity, ari&s;ing from this, and &s;trengthens it by operating &s;imilarly on the mind; it begets an additional degree of conviction, by giving an ad|ditional perception of excellence. It has been ob&s;erved, for in&s;tance, tho'
<PB N="xxi" REF="20">
for the mo&s;t part only incidentally, that the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity naturally &s;oftens the rigour of de&s;poti&s;m, introdu|ces moderation into government, ba|ni&s;hes many inconvenient civil laws once generally prevalent, gives ri&s;e to others of a very happy tendency, re|fines the laws of war, humanizes the manners, and improves the cu&s;toms of nations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'e&s;prit des loix. Liv. 24. chap. 3, 4, 6, 19.</NOTE>. All the&s;e, and others which might be mentioned, are purpo&s;es, di|&s;tinct from the principal and ultimate end of Chri&s;tianity, but con&s;i&s;tent with it, and in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;ubordinate to it; and the &s;ub&s;erviency of that reli|gion to each of the&s;e purpo&s;es, is a par|ticular in&s;tance of its excellence, and con&s;equently an additional indication of its truth. When the &s;ub&s;ervience of Chri&s;tianity to any &s;uch end, is thus profe&s;&s;edly con&s;idered as a <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> excellence, the inconveniencies are a|voided, which would ari&s;e from an in|di&s;tinct
<PB N="xxii" REF="21">
conception of its ultimate end, and proper excellence. We &s;hall not naturally be led into a di&s;torted view of its doctrines, by having in our eye what we regard only as a &s;ubordinate end of it. Infidels have no right to de|mand, that it be proved to their &s;atis|faction, that Chri&s;tianity po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every &s;ubordinate excellence which &s;ome think they &s;ee good rea&s;on to a&s;cribe to it: whatever objections they can rai&s;e a|gain&s;t &s;uch in&s;tances of its excellence, are objections, not again&s;t Chri&s;tiani|ty, but again&s;t one particular topic which, to tho&s;e who perceive its force, will &s;erve as a confirmation of that re|ligion, but which, if it &s;hould be deem|ed fallacious, cannot rea&s;onably infu&s;e the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion of fal&s;ehood, &s;ince it leaves all the principal evidences in their full force.&mdash;Another cla&s;s of col|lateral arguments for the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion, ari&s;es from particu|lars
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22">
in its nature, or from effects pro|duced by it, or from facts in the go|&s;pel hi&s;tory, which cannot be at all accounted for, but on the &s;uppo&s;ition of a divine original, or which are, at lea&s;t, mo&s;t naturally explicable on that &s;uppo&s;ition. Such arguments produce conviction, in a manner totally differ|ent from tho&s;e already mentioned; not by &s;imply exciting a perception of excellence, but by making us feel, that we mu&s;t offer violence to the natural principles of our under&s;tanding, and be involved in ab&s;urdities, if we will deny the divinity of Chri&s;tianity. In numberle&s;s in&s;tances, both in common life, and in the &s;ciences, our conclu|&s;ions re&s;t on a foundation entirely &s;i|milar to this. Whatever circum&s;tance is unaccountable without &s;uppo&s;ing the truth of Chri&s;tianity, affords a real pre|&s;umption for it, the &s;trength of which will depend on the nature of that cir|cum&s;tance,
<PB N="xxiv" REF="23">
and the degree of its unac|countablene&s;s. On this &s;ingle princi|ple, the character of Judas I&s;cariot has been, not without &s;ucce&s;s, applied to confirm the truth of the go&s;pel. But mo&s;t of the arguments reducible to this cla&s;s, are more complicated in their na|ture: the circum&s;tances from which they ari&s;e have other qualities, be&s;ides their unaccountablene&s;s, that indicate the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion, and the conviction produced by them is partly owing to the principles of belief on which the&s;e other qualities naturally operate. Hence ari&s;es a con&s;iderable variety in the pre&s;umptive arguments for Chri&s;tianity; of which it may be worth while to take &s;ome further no|tice. Some of them, in re&s;pect of the circum&s;tances from which they ari&s;e, and of the manner in which they af|fect the under&s;tanding, are allied chief|ly to the internal evidences of Chri&s;ti|anity;
<PB N="xxv" REF="24">
others to the external.&mdash;The circum&s;tances from which &s;ome pre|&s;umptive arguments for our religion ari&s;e, are &s;uch in their nature, as, while they are inexplicable, without &s;uppo|&s;ing its divinity, excite at the &s;ame time a perception of excellence. Thus, the character of Je&s;us is rai&s;ed far above a mere human character; and yet it is u|niformly &s;upported: it is a character perfectly extraordinary and &s;ingular; and therefore, if it had not been real, the Evangeli&s;ts cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed ca|pable of delineating it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Duchal's pre&s;umptive arguments for the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion, Serm. I.</NOTE>. In our Sa|viour's la&s;t di&s;cour&s;es to his di&s;ciples, and his prayer for them, recorded in the go&s;pel<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xiv. xv. xvi. xvii.</NOTE>, the mixture of dignity and tenderne&s;s which he di&s;plays, the plain account which he gives of the dangers and difficulties to be expected by his followers, and the nature of the &s;up|ports
<PB N="xxvi" REF="25">
and con&s;olations which he pro|mi&s;es them; afford &s;triking pre&s;ump|tions, that, if Je&s;us &s;pake them, he could be no impo&s;tor; and that, if he had not really &s;poken them, the Evan|geli&s;t never could have feigned them, or a&s;cribed them to him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Duchal, Serm. iv.</NOTE>. The cha|racters of &s;ome of the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Serm. viii.</NOTE>; the controver&s;ies among Chri&s;tians in the apo&s;tolic age<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Serm. ix.</NOTE>; the practice of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, in uniformly referring their claim to the impartial inquiries of men, and renouncing eve|ry other method of recommending it<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Serm. x.</NOTE>; have been &s;hown to contain &s;trong pre|&s;umptions of the truth of Chri&s;tianity. The&s;e all belong to the cla&s;s of argu|ments now under con&s;ideration. They affect two different principles of belief at once: they lead us to conclude that Chri&s;tianity is divine, by &s;howing us that, if it is not, certain particulars in
<PB N="xxvii" REF="26">
it mu&s;t be unaccountable: and they ex|hibit an in&s;tance of excellence, which di&s;po&s;es us to infer the truth of the re|ligion po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it: the&s;e qualities make &s;eparate impre&s;&s;ions on the un|der&s;tanding; the conviction produced, is the joint effect of both, and is &s;trong|er than what would have been produ|ced by either of them alone. In ar|guments of this &s;ort, the&s;e qualities are combined in very different pro|portions; &s;ometimes one, &s;ometimes the other is predominant; and &s;ome|times it is difficult to determine, to which of them the conviction is prin|cipally owing.&mdash;Other arguments have an affinity to the external evidences of Chri&s;tianity; they add credibility to them, they predi&s;po&s;e the mind to ad|mit them, or they heighten its acqui|e&s;cence in their &s;ufficiency; and they produce the&s;e effects in different de|grees, and in different ways.&mdash;Some of

the circum&s;tances and facts relating to Chri&s;tianity, which are unaccountable without &s;uppo&s;ing it divine, and there|fore afford pre&s;umptions for it, contain a mixture of &s;omething miraculous, which by being &s;uch, implies the divi|nity of this religion, and which carries along with it &s;atisfying evidence of its own reality. Thus, it has been &s;hown by a late writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bell's inquiry into the divine mi&s;&s;ions of John the Bapti&s;t and Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</NOTE>, that the claims of John the Bapti&s;t and of Je&s;us mutually &s;upport each other, and that both the circum&s;tances attending the births of the&s;e per&s;ons, many of which were mi|raculous, and their whole conduct to|wards one another in their public life, afford a full proof that Je&s;us was the Me&s;&s;iah, and John his forerunner. The argument concludes chiefly by &s;how|ing tho&s;e circum&s;tances and that con|duct to be inexplicable except on the &s;uppo&s;ition of the divine mi&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="xxix" REF="28">
the&s;e per&s;ons: but this is not the whole of its force; there is in it a mixture of miracle, which makes a &s;eparate im|pre&s;&s;ion on the mind, &s;imilar to what is made by the miracles wrought by Chri&s;t: we may add, that this argument does, in &s;everal ways, indirectly contri|bute both to the credibility of the Chri|&s;tian miracles, and to the illu&s;tration of ancient predictions. The &s;ame ob|&s;ervations are applicable to the mira|culous conver&s;ion, and the &s;ub&s;equent conduct of the apo&s;tle Paul; the force of which for proving the truth of Chri|&s;tianity, has been di&s;played with great &s;trength of rea&s;oning, by two very in|genious modern authors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations on the conver&s;ion and apo&s;tle&s;hip of St. Paul, in a letter to Gilbert We&s;t, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>&mdash;Duchal, Serm. v. vi.</NOTE>.&mdash;There are arguments which corroborate the truth of Chri&s;tianity, by adding weight to its external evidences, in a manner &s;till more direct.

not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for ren|dering the&s;e evidences complete, and therefore they may be ju&s;tly con&s;ider|ed as &s;eparate and independent evi|dences, of the collateral kind. If the ancient prophets had predicted the time of the appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah, the place of his birth, and many cir|cum&s;tances of his life and death, and the&s;e had all belonged to Je&s;us, this would have been &s;ufficient to prove him the per&s;on intended by them, tho' there had been nothing uncommon in any of the&s;e circum&s;tances con&s;idered by them&s;elves; for it is not to be ex|pected that a great number even of the mo&s;t ordinary circum&s;tances, com|bined at random by a pretender to pro|phecy, &s;hould ever meet in any one per|&s;on. But when we con&s;ider that many of the particulars predicted concerning the Me&s;&s;iah, and accompli&s;hed in Je&s;us, are perfectly extraordinary in their own
<PB N="xxxi" REF="30">
nature, and &s;eemingly incompatible with one another, this affords evidence of the truth of our religion, additional to what ari&s;es merely from the accom|pli&s;hment of <HI>any</HI> prophecy. A &s;imilar confirmation of Chri&s;tianity has been deduced from &s;ome circum&s;tances in the character of the Man of &s;in, fore|told by Paul, &s;o &s;ingular, that mere imagination &s;carce could have &s;ugge&s;t|ed them, and that, if it had, they never could have taken place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Duchal, Sermon vii.</NOTE>. The&s;e in|&s;tances have an immediate relation to the proof of Chri&s;tianity from prophe|cy; others are related to the proof from miracles. Such are the argument from the quick and exten&s;ive propagation of the go&s;pel, which has been often urged; and which corroborates the evidence from miracles, in the very &s;ame way as the efficacy of the go&s;pel corroborates its internal evidence; and the argu|ment
<PB N="xxxii" REF="31">
from the conce&s;&s;ions of ancient Infidels, which has been propo&s;ed oftener than once, and is briefly &s;tated in one of the following Di&s;&s;ertations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ert. ii. Sect. 2.</NOTE>. The argument for Chri&s;tianity, from the continuance, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate, of the nation of the Jews<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lardner's Di&s;cour&s;es on, The Circum&s;tances of the Jewi&s;h People, an Argument for the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</NOTE>, is almo&s;t equal|ly related to the proof from miracles, and to that from prophecy.&mdash;The cla&s;|&s;es of arguments, which have been mentioned, are plainly di&s;tinct; their force ari&s;es from different principles. Some collateral arguments for Chri&s;ti|anity, are however of a mixt or compli|cated nature; they belong not wholly to one cla&s;s, but operate by &s;everal principles at once. As all the grada|tions of nature are delicate and almo&s;t imperceptible, there may be arguments which we can, with almo&s;t equal pro|priety,
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="32">
reduce to one cla&s;s or another.&mdash;But there are arguments al&s;o which have an equal relation to the internal and the external evidences of Chri&s;ti|anity, and add weight equally to both. The arguments pur&s;ued in both the fol|lowing Di&s;&s;ertations, are of this kind. But they corroborate tho&s;e evidences in different ways. The manner in which Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles propo&s;ed the evidences of their mi&s;&s;ion, adds force to the matter of all the&s;e eviden|ces, ju&s;t as a proper way of propo&s;ing any proof increa&s;es its effect: attention to this manner brings into our view an excellence in Chri&s;tianity, which naturally di&s;po&s;es us to the reception of it: it moreover pre&s;ents a circum|&s;tance which would be unaccountable, if Chri&s;tianity were an impo&s;ture. There are perhaps other collateral ar|guments which corroborate all the di|rect proofs of the go&s;pel, in a &s;imilar
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="33">
manner, by contributing indirectly to make them in&s;inuate a &s;tronger convic|tion into the mind. The argument of the &s;econd Di&s;&s;ertation corroborates all the evidences of our religion, in a much more direct manner: They have been &s;crutinized by Infidels; they have with&s;tood all the oppo&s;ition of argu|ment; they have gained by it: hence is deduced a po&s;itive proof that the&s;e evidences are &s;olid, additional to that conviction of their force, which ari&s;es from mere attention to them; the faith produced by their natural &s;trength, is deepened by a reflex act of the mind approving that faith, and pronouncing it ju&s;t and rational.&mdash;The&s;e reflections, on the varieties of which pre&s;umptive or collateral arguments for Chri&s;tianity are &s;u&s;ceptible, and on the principles from which they derive their force, will contribute to our forming a ju&s;t judg|ment of particular arguments, in the
<PB N="xxxv" REF="34">
&s;ame way as a logical theory of evi|dence contributes to our di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;olid rea&s;oning from &s;ophi&s;try, or as critical ob&s;ervations tend to guide and improve the ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The direct evidences of the Chri&s;tian Religion are, no doubt, the mo&s;t im|portant: but no real evidence for it ought to be neglected. Every new probability, when it is &s;et in a proper light, and viewed in connexion with the other proofs, adds brightne&s;s to the evidence upon the whole. Nothing can contribute more than a multitude of evidences, ari&s;ing from various and di&s;&s;imilar views of Chri&s;tianity, to &s;ettle us in that full a&s;&s;urance of faith, which will operate mo&s;t certainly on the heart, and to prevent our being thrown into doubts, by every minute objection which we cannot immediately an&s;wer to our entire &s;atisfaction. Be&s;ides, the direct and principal evidences of Chri|&s;tianity,
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="35">
have been long the &s;ubject of controver&s;y between Infidels and Chri|&s;tians; arguments have been multiplied and repeated on both &s;ides: &s;ome have learned to take it for granted, without examination, that the&s;e evidences are weak, or at lea&s;t di&s;putable; and there|fore they never think of attending to them. If &s;uch can at all be rou&s;ed to an impartial inquiry into the truth of Chri&s;tianity, it will mo&s;t probably be, by their being led to perceive, that it has other evidences than they imagi|ned, evidences additional to all tho&s;e which Infidels have &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly la|boured to confute. When &s;uch evi|dences are &s;ugge&s;ted, novelty may in|duce &s;ome to attend to them; if they find that they afford con&s;iderable pre|&s;umptions of the truth of the go&s;pel, they will naturally begin to &s;u&s;pect, that its direct evidences may po&s;&s;ibly have greater &s;trength, than they have
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="36">
been di&s;po&s;ed to allow them; in con&s;e|quence of this &s;u&s;picion, they may be brought to give them a fair examina|tion, and to yield to their force. This effect, I am per&s;uaded, has been in a very con&s;iderable degree produced by &s;ome of the works, which have furni&s;h|ed me with examples of the principles ju&s;t now laid down. The&s;e works &s;erve both to encourage others to &s;imilar at|tempts, and to point out the manner in which &s;uch attempts ought to be con|ducted. For &s;uch attempts, the Author of the following Di&s;&s;ertations, had &s;ome advantages from his &s;ituation. The du|ty of his profe&s;&s;ion led him to employ all that attention on the evidences of Chri&s;tianity, which was nece&s;&s;ary for giving the ju&s;te&s;t repre&s;entation of them that he could, in the cour&s;e of his Theological Lectures. In con&s;equence of this attention, &s;everal circum&s;tances occurred, which appeared to him of con|&s;iderable
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="37">
importance in e&s;tabli&s;hing and confirming the truth of Chri&s;tianity, but which had been hitherto overlook|ed, or at mo&s;t but &s;lightly touched up|on; &s;ome which might throw new light on the principal evidences and the ge|neral defence of it; &s;ome which afford|ed &s;eparate arguments for its truth; and &s;ome which &s;erved to illu&s;trate its true genius and &s;pirit. Of the&s;e, how|ever, the &s;ubjects alone which are con|&s;idered in this volume, have hitherto been reduced into &s;uch form, as that they could be offered to the public: and between them there is a natural connexion. In the fir&s;t Di&s;&s;ertation, the argument is drawn from the man|ner in which the evidences of the go|&s;pel were propo&s;ed at fir&s;t: in the &s;e|cond, from the manner in which they have &s;ince been both oppo&s;ed and vin|dicated. The former is a proper in|troduction to the latter; for the ways
<PB N="xxxix" REF="38">
in which new light could be thrown upon the evidences of the go&s;pel, ne|ce&s;&s;arily depend, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, on the manner in which the&s;e evidences were propo&s;ed at fir&s;t; and as their being propo&s;ed at fir&s;t in &s;uch a man|ner as to remain capable of further confirmation by any means, might be &s;u&s;pected by &s;ome to imply, that they were left imperfect by the divine Au|thor, and the in&s;pired publi&s;hers of the Chri&s;tian Faith, it is after a full proof of the propriety of the manner in which they exhibited the evidences of their mi&s;&s;ion, that the light and confirma|tion afterwards derived from oppo&s;i|tion, can be pointed out with greate&s;t advantage: the latter is a proper &s;e|quel to the former, and ari&s;es natural|ly out of it; after having ob&s;erved how Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles propo&s;ed the e|vidences of their mi&s;&s;ion, and how they defended it, when it was called in que|&s;tion,
<PB N="xl" REF="39">
and after having perceived the advantages accruing to Chri&s;tianity from the whole of their manner, it is natural to examine how Chri&s;tianity has been defended &s;ince, and what conclu&s;ions can be deduced from the effect which oppo&s;ition has had upon it. At the &s;ame time, each Di&s;&s;ertation con|tains an entire and &s;eparate argument for the truth of Chri&s;tianity. A few of the objections al&s;o, which Infidels have propo&s;ed, are examined, as they came incidentally in the way; and they are examined with this advan|tage, that the principles, from which the &s;olutions flow, are previou&s;ly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and particularly illu&s;trated; an advantage which can &s;carce be ob|tained, at lea&s;t in &s;o great a degree, in any treati&s;e written with a profe&s;&s;ed intention to an&s;wer a number of diffe|rent objections.</P>

<P>THERE is &s;carce any criterion of Truth, le&s;s ambiguous than this, That it gains evidence by being placed in a variety of lights. There is gene|rally one &s;ituation in which error ad|mits a &s;pecious di&s;gui&s;e; and, by be|ing artfully &s;hown only in that &s;itua|tion, it often impo&s;es on the under|&s;tanding: but &s;et it in another point of view, it is immediately detected,
<PB N="2" REF="42">
and men wonder how they came to be deceived. There have been impo&s;|tures in religion, which, if you con&s;ider them only on one &s;ide, &s;eem capable of a very plau&s;ible defence; but none of them can bear to be accu|rately in&s;pected on all &s;ides. The Chri&s;tian religion proves it&s;elf to be no impo&s;ture, by its &s;hining forth with new evidence in every light in which it can be placed: there is &s;carce any circum&s;tance attending it, which is not found on trial to give te&s;timony to its truth.</P>
<P>The nature of the principal eviden|ces of Chri&s;tianity, has been often ex|plained; their &s;trength has been fully illu&s;trated and vindicated: The <HI>man|ner</HI> in which they were propo&s;ed by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles has not been &s;o carefully attended to. Infidels have in&s;inuated, that this manner is in &s;ome re&s;pects exceptionable: it is however
<PB N="3" REF="43">
truly &s;uch as adds weight to the evi|dences them&s;elves. It contains &s;eve|ral &s;eparate pre&s;umptions of the truth of Chri&s;tianity; and therefore merits a particular examination.</P>
<P>Both Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles pro|po&s;ed the evidences of their mi&s;&s;ion, in two very different &s;ituations: they propo&s;ed them to tho&s;e who had not yet expre&s;&s;ed prejudice again&s;t the go&s;|pel, or again&s;t the proofs of its divinity which were offered: and they propo|&s;ed them to tho&s;e who were already engaged in oppo&s;ition, and had actu|ally moved objections. In the&s;e oppo|&s;ite &s;ituations, they propo&s;ed them in different manners, which it will be nece&s;&s;ary to examine &s;eparately. Each was proper in the circum&s;tances in which it was u&s;ed. Each has pecu|liar advantages, by means of which it affords collateral evidence of the truth of the go&s;pel. When we con|&s;ider
<PB N="4" REF="44">
both together, we &s;hall perceive, that the evidence of our religion was propo&s;ed in a manner which is ab|&s;olutely complete, and which bears the &s;tronge&s;t marks of a divine ori|ginal.</P>

<HEAD>The manner in which the Evidences of Chri&s;ti|anity were
originally propo&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall begin with examining the manner in which Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles propo&s;ed the eviden|ces of the go&s;pel to tho&s;e who had not yet oppo&s;ed it, or expre&s;&s;ed preju|dice again&s;t it. This we may call their original manner. The New Te&s;ta|ment affords us the means of a&s;cer|taining it with preci&s;ion. In addre&s;|&s;ing tho&s;e who did not rai&s;e objec|tions again&s;t the go&s;pel, it was their uniform method, to &s;atisfy them&s;elves with barely exhibiting its evidences. They laboured not to prove by ar|gumentation, that the&s;e evidences were &s;ufficient; they were not at
<PB N="6" REF="46">
pains either to prevent or to remove every objection which might be &s;tart|ed; they explained not minutely the particular manner in which each evi|dence &s;upports their mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE excellence of Chri&s;tianity, is alone a con&s;iderable evidence of its divinity. Our Saviour <HI>exhibited</HI> this evidence in its full &s;trength; but he never <HI>urged</HI> it, except when he was led to urge it, by oppo&s;ition. He delivered doctrines which were really excellent, and bore clear marks of truth and divinity: but he did not &s;tudiou&s;ly point out their &s;everal per|fections; he did not multiply a&s;&s;er|tions, either that they were excellent, or that their excellence proved their divinity. He left his hearers to <HI>feel</HI> the excellence of his religion, and from their feeling of its energy, to conclude for them&s;elves, that it was
<PB N="7" REF="47">
of heavenly original. It was not by means of his encomiums, but by means of their own perceptions, that great numbers di&s;covered the features of di|vinity in his di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>He exhibited the proof of his mi&s;|&s;ion ari&s;ing from miracles, with equal &s;implicity. He made no commenta|ry on the very fir&s;t miracle, which he wrought in Cana; he left it to <HI>mani|fe&s;t forth his glory</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John ii. 11.</NOTE> merely by its na|tural force. When he entered more profe&s;&s;edly upon his mini&s;try in Ga|lilee, his manner was entirely &s;imilar: <HI>he taught in their &s;ynagogues, and preached the go&s;pel of the kingdom, and ca&s;t out de|vils, and healed all manner of &s;ickne&s;s, and all manner of di&s;ea&s;es among the people</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. iv. 23. Mark i. 39.</NOTE>. He publi&s;hed his doctrine, he perform|ed miracles &s;ufficient for proving that it was from God: but we are not in|formed that he employed arguments
<PB N="8" REF="48">
for evincing that his miracles were proper and conclu&s;ive evidences. Through his whole public life, <HI>he re|ceived them that followed him, and &s;pake unto them of the kingdom of God</HI>; and, to induce them to believe him, <HI>healed them that had need of healing</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke ix. 11. Mark ix. 35.</NOTE>. He did miraculous works of the mo&s;t various and the mo&s;t &s;tupendous kinds: he &s;atisfied him&s;elf with having done them; he entered into no laboured detail of the circum&s;tances which &s;how|ed their reality, into no nice reflections on the &s;trength of the&s;e circum&s;tances, into no &s;ubtile explications of the con|nexion between miracles and doctrines: he left his miracles to &s;peak for him in their own language, and to &s;upport both their reality and their force by their own internal characters of truth and divine power.

<PB N="14" REF="54">
it was by no means nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould make this declaration at the time of working every miracle.

The pre&s;ent que&s;tion is not, whether the evidences of the go|&s;pel be &s;uch in them&s;elves, that, when properly propo&s;ed, they will prove it to be a divine revelation; but it is, whether, &s;uppo&s;ing them real and &s;uf|ficient evidences, that which we have de&s;cribed, was a proper manner of pro|po&s;ing them?

<P>EVIDENCE ought, no doubt, to be propo&s;ed in a proper manner: argu|ments of real &s;trength may be &s;tated in &s;o imperfect a manner, that they &s;hall

produce no conviction. If it could be proved, that this was the ca&s;e of Chri|&s;tianity, it would give &s;ome rea&s;on for &s;aying, that it was not &s;upported by argument. IT may be thought, that this receives &s;ome colour from the re|pre&s;entation which has been given of the manner of our Saviour and his apo|&s;tles: but it is only in appearance.

<P>No pre&s;umption again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, can ari&s;e from that manner, becau&s;e it is &s;ufficient for producing belief.

This appears in &s;ome degree from matter of fact: that they were barely exhibited to per|&s;ons in this &s;tate, has been already &s;hown; that multitudes were convin|ced, and embraced the go&s;pel, is un|deniable. <Q REND="inline">"Perhaps the&s;e believed without evidence."</Q> We allow that
<PB N="42" REF="82">
men often do believe without rea&s;on, and therefore we enlarge not on this topic. But, that the manner in que|&s;tion was &s;ufficient for conviction, may be proved from the con&s;titution of the human mind, and the nature of evi|dence. If the evidences of the go&s;pel be in them&s;elves &s;olid, it was by no means nece&s;&s;ary for the founder of it, by a nice analy&s;is of them, or by an ab&s;tract explication of their principles and force, &s;tudiou&s;ly to point out their &s;olidity. Natural evidence is, by the original con&s;titution of the human &s;oul, adapted to the under&s;tanding; there are principles of belief e&s;&s;ential to man, on which it in&s;tantly lays hold, and by means of which, without the need of deep reflection, of laborious illu&s;tra|tions, or of intricate rea&s;onings, it will produce conviction in all who are not perverted by the &s;ophi&s;try of fal&s;e &s;cience, or vitiated by unnatural re|finement.
<PB N="43" REF="83">
Evidence is different from rea&s;oning: evidence perceived is the immediate cau&s;e of belief; rea&s;oning is but one mean of bringing men to perceive the evidence; and it is a mean which is far from being ne|ce&s;&s;ary in every ca&s;e. The &s;tronge&s;t conviction po&s;&s;ible is produced by &s;im|ple intuition, which leaves no room for rea&s;oning. There are &s;ome pro|po&s;itions, mathematical truths, for in|&s;tance, the evidence of which can be perceived only by a chain of rea|&s;oning, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal &s;teps, and deducing the conclu&s;ion gradually from fir&s;t principles. But the evi|dence of natural and moral truths, and in general of all matters of fact, is of a totally different &s;ort: it requires not a long proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, in or|der to its being perceived: a fact is exhibited, and from that, a conclu&s;ion concerning another fact, is directly in|ferred;
<PB N="44" REF="84">
the natural con&s;titution of the mind determines it to make the infe|rence, and to adopt it, without any compari&s;on of ideas, or the interven|tion of any middle terms. We can give no rea&s;on for it, but that our con&s;titution determines us to it, and renders it impo&s;&s;ible for us to do otherwi&s;e. In &s;ubjects of this kind, therefore, there is much le&s;s need of rea&s;oning, and much le&s;s &s;cope for it, than in &s;ome others. Often the evi|dence is perceived without any rea&s;on|ing at all; and when it is, it would be &s;uperfluous to employ rea&s;oning. Fire will burn a human creature who ap|proaches too near it, is a natural truth; we do not prove it by any proce&s;s of rea&s;oning concerning the qualities of fire, and tho&s;e of human bodies; our experience of the effects of fire in pa&s;t in&s;tances, is the natural evidence of this truth; and we per|ceive
<PB N="45" REF="85">
that evidence in an in&s;tant, and are convinced by it without argument. Now the evidences of the go&s;pel are of this kind; they are facts, the percep|tion of which leads the mind naturally to infer the truth of the go&s;pel. The facts may be perceived without rea&s;on|ing; the conclu&s;ion is likewi&s;e deduced without rea&s;oning. They who &s;ee an inveterate di&s;temper cured, or a dead per&s;on rai&s;ed, by a &s;ingle word of a man claiming a divine mi&s;&s;ion, will need no arguments to convince them, that he has wrought miracles; and being convinced of this, if their natu|ral principles of belief be not ob&s;truc|ted, or perverted, they will readily conclude, <HI>We know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no man can do the&s;e miracles which thou do&s;t, except God be with him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii. 2.</NOTE>.

<P>But though the evidence of matters of fact does not nece&s;&s;arily <HI>require</HI> rea|&s;oning, yet it often <HI>admits</HI> rea&s;oning.

When there are oppo&s;ite probabilities, rea&s;oning may be u&s;ed for determining which of them ought to preponderate. When objections are rai&s;ed again&s;t the ju&s;t|ne&s;s of a particular inference, it may be vindicated by rea&s;oning. Rea&s;oning may be employed for inve&s;tigating the general principles of belief in mat|ters of fact, for giving an account how we come to yield to the&s;e principles,

for explaining the theory of evidence, and for &s;howing that our conclu&s;ion, in a particular in&s;tance, is agreeable to that theory, and &s;upported by it. But it is by no means nece&s;&s;ary that a per|&s;on enter into all the&s;e rea&s;onings, in order to his obtaining conviction in any ca&s;e. If evidence be pre&s;ented &s;uitable to the ca&s;e, it will beget con|viction, tho' we attend not to any of the&s;e &s;orts of rea&s;oning, tho' we have never reflected how we come to be convinced, tho' we be not aware of all the objections which may be rai&s;ed again&s;t the &s;ufficiency of the evidence, tho' we be not able to an&s;wer them all particularly, if they were propo&s;ed to us. It is enough that the evidence be in its nature fit for operating on the human under&s;tanding: then con|viction will ari&s;e &s;pontaneou&s;ly on the exhibition of it.

To perceive evidence, is one thing; to account for evidence, is quite a different thing: the former on|ly is nece&s;&s;ary for conviction. In like manner, to propo&s;e evidence proper in a particular ca&s;e, is totally different from laying down a theory of evidence, or from giving an ab&s;tract proof of the &s;ufficiency of it, or an explication of the manner in which it works convic|tion: the former is all that is fit, or nece&s;|&s;ary,

in addre&s;&s;ing the bulk of mankind on any &s;ubject. Our Saviour and his a|po&s;tles addre&s;&s;ed mankind in that very manner. They wrought miracles, for in&s;tance, and cited prophecies, in proof of their mi&s;&s;ion. If the&s;e be at all evi|dences of a divine mi&s;&s;ion, they are &s;uch evidences, that the &s;imple exhibi|tion of them is &s;ufficient for producing conviction. It mu&s;t be remembered, that the&s;e evidences do not appear to us in the very &s;ame light, as they did to tho&s;e to whom the go&s;pel was origi|nally propo&s;ed. In order to judge what was &s;ufficient for them, we mu&s;t carefully di&s;tingui&s;h their &s;ituation from our own; we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves placed in their circum&s;tances. Who|ever attends to the controver&s;y con|cerning the truth of Chri&s;tianity, will perceive that circum&s;tances peculiar to us, have occa&s;ioned far the greate&s;t part of the rea&s;oning u&s;ed on either

&s;ide. On this account, though a va|riety of arguments may be nece&s;&s;ary for convincing us of the truth of Chri|&s;tianity, it by no means follows, that the &s;ame arguments were nece&s;&s;ary for their conviction, to whom our Saviour and his apo&s;tles &s;poke. With re&s;pect to them, there was &s;carce even &s;cope for rea&s;oning. Almo&s;t all the rea&s;on|ings, for in&s;tance, which have been in|troduced concerning the proof from prophecy, are employed in &s;howing, that the prophecies of the Old Te&s;ta|ment were intended of the Me&s;&s;iah. Ought our Saviour to have entered in|to the&s;e rea&s;onings, in preaching to the Jews? To us, they may be nece&s;&s;ary: but to them, they would have been &s;uperfluous: they were per&s;uaded al|ready that the&s;e prophecies related to the Me&s;&s;iah; if they were really fulfil|led in Je&s;us, the fulfilment would be perceived whenever they were atten|tively

compared with the corre&s;pondent events; a &s;imple appeal to the predic|tions, was &s;ufficient for exciting their attention. Our rea&s;onings concerning miracles likewi&s;e, are employed chiefly in proving, that the works a&s;cribed to Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, were really done by them: in the fir&s;t publication of the go&s;pel, there was no room for the&s;e rea&s;onings; if the works were at all done, they &s;aw them with their eyes. No per&s;on who is fully per&s;uaded, that the extraordinary facts recorded in the go&s;pel, really happened, will he&s;itate to pronounce them miraculous; but the &s;ight of them could not fail to &s;trike the mind more vigorou&s;ly, than any conception of them which we can form by the force of imagination; and, by rea&s;on of the &s;uperior &s;trength and vi|vacity of their impre&s;&s;ion, they who &s;aw them, would pronounce them mi|raculous, more quickly and confident|ly

Be&s;ides, the &s;cruples which have been moved on this head, ari&s;e from &s;uppo&s;itions, that we may be ignorant of &s;ome circum&s;tances of the&s;e facts, nece&s;&s;ary for determining their real nature: having only a relation of them, we may find room for doubts, and di&s;putes, and rea&s;onings; but they could find none; they were eye|witne&s;&s;es of the facts with all their real circum&s;tances; if the&s;e did render them plainly miraculous, they needed no arguments to prove that they did, they mu&s;t perceive it by their own &s;en&s;es; if the&s;e circum&s;tances did leave the mira|cle equivocal, no arguments could prove that they did not. We may add, that they to whom our Saviour and his apo&s;tles propo&s;ed the evidences of their mi&s;&s;ion without rea&s;oning, al|lowed miracles to be a proof of a divine mi&s;&s;ion; the&s;e teachers had not this conviction to produce by argumenta|tion;

they found their hearers already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and had nothing to do but to lay hold of it by working mi|racles.

If we could perceive evidence on all &s;ubjects by &s;imple intuition, without any argu|ments,

our under&s;tanding would be much more perfect than it is: it is its imperfection, that renders rea&s;oning at all nece&s;&s;ary for our perceiving evi|dence, or being convinced by it.

conviction, this alone may lead us to favourable &s;entiments of the go&s;pel; for this could proceed only from the <HI>&s;trength</HI> of its evidence. The &s;tronge&s;t evidence, in every kind, is that which operates mo&s;t immediately on the un|der&s;tanding: it is when evidence is weak or doubtful, that much rea&s;on|ing is nece&s;&s;ary for making its force to be perceived. A full proof from ex|perience not only produces a&s;&s;urance, but al&s;o produces it in an in&s;tant: pro|bability produces only opinion, and produces not even that without &s;ome deliberation and rea&s;oning; and the weaker the probability is, the longer and more intricate is the rea&s;oning by which it may be determined, whether it ought to produce a&s;&s;ent, or not. Had the evidence of the go&s;pel been weak, it could not have produced conviction, without the need of rea&s;oning: it was only its being &s;trong and clear, that
<PB N="62" REF="102">
rendered the &s;imple exhibition of it &s;uf|ficient. The &s;trength of that evidence is perceived by the direct view of it: but the circum&s;tance now con&s;ider|ed, pre&s;ents a new indication of its &s;trength, which is di&s;cerned by reflec|tion, and adds a&s;&s;urance to the direct perception of it, and con&s;equently to the belief of the go&s;pel. This pre&s;ump|tion re&s;ts indeed on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the evidence of the go&s;pel, is in its nature &s;ufficient for begetting convic|tion: to all, however, who admit this &s;uppo&s;ition, it will be an additional ar|gument for the truth of the go&s;pel; it will have real force with every Chri|&s;tian who attends to it, and will &s;erve to confirm his faith. But it may be thought, that it can have no weight with infidels. It cannot, we acknow|ledge, have the &s;ame weight with them as with Chri&s;tians: but even with them, it ought to have &s;ome weight. They
<PB N="63" REF="103">
will not allow, that the evidences of the go&s;pel are in their nature &s;ufficient grounds of belief: but they cannot deny, that they did actually prevail on many to believe; and it is certain that they were originally merely exhibited; the exhibition of them, therefore, was in fact &s;ufficient for working conviction in many. This is an undeniable pre|&s;umption, that its evidence was very &s;trong. Let all rea&s;onable allowances be made for the credulity of mankind, let it be owned, that they have often believed without &s;ufficient evidence, yea without any real evidence at all: yet this never happens, but it may be accounted for; &s;lender evidence is &s;tu|diou&s;ly &s;et off by &s;pecious rea&s;onings, men are artificially diverted from at|tending to the want of evidence, &s;ome method is u&s;ed for giving the appear|ance of evidence where there is none, or for giving an appearance of greater
<PB N="64" REF="104">
evidence than there really is. But in the original propo&s;al of the go&s;pel, there was nothing of this kind. All that was done was, &s;imply to pre&s;ent the eviden|ces of the go&s;pel, naked and unadorn|ed. Is it po&s;&s;ible that this method could have &s;ucceeded, if there had been no real evidence? Mu&s;t not the defect have been quickly perceived, when no means at all were employed to conceal it? If the evidence had not been very &s;trong, could it in this way have been effectual? Is there any thing that can account for the original reception of Chri&s;tianity, except the &s;trength and fulne&s;s of its evidence? There are very certain truths, which have failed of ob|taining belief, becau&s;e their evidence has been only propo&s;ed, not fully ur|ged, or particularly illu&s;trated: but there never was a fal&s;ehood &s;ucce&s;sfully inculcated by a bare exhibition of pre|tended evidence, without any art or
<PB N="65" REF="105">
pains employed for colouring the de|fect, and impo&s;ing on the under&s;tand|ing. Since a &s;imple exhibition, there|fore, of the evidences of the go&s;pel, did confe&s;&s;edly bring multitudes to the belief of it, this is undoubtedly a &s;trong pre&s;umption of its truth.</P>
<P>Further, the method in which our Saviour and his apo&s;tles propo&s;ed the evidences of the go&s;pel, was not only <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> for bringing men to believe the go&s;pel: it was the <HI>fitte&s;t</HI> for this pur|po&s;e. The more &s;imply evidence can be, in any ca&s;e, propo&s;ed, con&s;i&s;tently with clearne&s;s, the more readily it will produce conviction: nice rea&s;onings, if they be not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, on|ly burden the evidence, and perplex the under&s;tanding. With re&s;pect to mathematical truths, the evidence of which can be rendered perceptible on|ly by a chain of rea&s;oning, the more minutely the demon&s;tration is pur&s;ued,
<PB N="66" REF="106">
the fewer the &s;teps omitted, the evi|dence generally &s;trikes the more ea&s;ily, and is the more irre&s;i&s;tible. But even here, there are certain limits: a de|mon&s;tration may be drawn out &s;o mi|nutely as to weaken the conviction; the &s;teps may be rendered &s;o many, that the difficulty of retaining them, overbalances the effect of the clearne&s;s with which the connexion of ideas is perceived in each &s;eparate &s;tep. It is certainly in learning tho&s;e mathemati|cal truths which require the longe&s;t &s;eries of &s;teps in a demon&s;tration of them, that the generality find the greate&s;t difficulty. Thus, even in &s;ub|jects which belong to its proper pro|vince, rea&s;oning may be carried to a degree of preci&s;ion which ob&s;tructs its end, and ob&s;cures the evidence. This will happen &s;till more readily in mat|ters of fact, which we are naturally formed for inferring, without a long
<PB N="67" REF="107">
chain of rea&s;oning, from the &s;imple view of what affords evidence for them. In delivering a &s;cience, and that too to &s;tudious per&s;ons, it is ju&s;tly reckon|ed a method improper for producing conviction, to ob&s;erve every difficulty or objection, and to confute it parti|cularly, as you go along. Few will di&s;pute the propriety of the cen&s;ure which Bacon pa&s;&s;es on the &s;chola&s;tics, for pur&s;uing this very method. <Q REND="inline">"The manner among&s;t them was this, &s;ays he; upon every particular po&s;ition or a&s;&s;ertion, to frame objections, and to tho&s;e objections &s;olutions; which &s;olu|tions were for the mo&s;t part not confu|tations, but di&s;tinctions: whereas in|deed the &s;trength of all &s;ciences is, as the &s;trength of the old man's faggot, in the band. For the harmony of a &s;cience &s;upporting each part the other, is and ought to be the true and brief confutation and &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of all the

But, on the other &s;ide, if you take out every axiom, as the &s;ticks of the faggot, one by one, you may quarrel with them, and bend them, and break them at your plea&s;ure: &s;o that, as was &s;aid of Seneca, <HI>Verborum minutiis rerum frangit pondera;</HI> &s;o a man may truly &s;ay of the &s;choolmen, <HI>Quae&s;ti|onum minutiis &s;cientiarum frangunt &s;olidita|tem.</HI> For were it not better for a man in a fair room, to &s;et up one great light, or branching candle&s;tick of lights, than to go about with a &s;mall watch|candle into every corner? And &s;uch is their method, that re&s;ts not &s;o much upon evidence of truth proved by ar|guments, authorities, &s;imilitudes, ex|amples, as upon particular confuta|tions and &s;olutions of every &s;cruple, cavillation, and objection; breeding for the mo&s;t part one que&s;tion, as fa&s;t as it &s;olveth another; even as in the former re&s;emblance, when you carry

This method would be improper even in delivering a &s;cience; but it would have been much more improper in laying down the evidences of the Chri&s;tian religion. This religion, it mu&s;t be remembered, was intended, not for the entertainment of the &s;pe|culative, but for the u&s;e of the whole of mankind: the propere&s;t manner, therefore, of propo&s;ing its evidences, was that which was fitte&s;t for the con|viction of the bulk of mankind; and what was fitte&s;t for this purpo&s;e, there
<PB N="70" REF="110">
is little difficulty in determining. Pro|po&s;e to an ordinary man, evidence really &s;uited to the nature of the &s;ub|ject, and to the principles of human under&s;tanding; he a&s;&s;ents without he|&s;itation. Inform him of all the excep|tions to which that evidence is liable; prove that the&s;e exceptions are not &s;uf|ficient to de&s;troy its force; a&s;certain its preci&s;e degree of &s;trength; point out its foundation in human nature; explain the manner in which it produ|ces belief: he cannot under&s;tand you, he is bewildered; if he continues to be convinced, it is owing to your fir&s;t &s;imple repre&s;entation of the evidence, not to your &s;ub&s;equent refinements; the&s;e tend rather to make him lo&s;e &s;ight of the point which ought to be belie|ved. All men are formed capable of being convinced by real evidence; but all men are not capable of reflect|ing on the manner in which their con|viction
<PB N="71" REF="111">
is wrought, or of under&s;tand|ing the theory of evidence: to attempt to teach them this, in order to their conviction in a particular in&s;tance, is not only unnece&s;&s;ary, but improper al|&s;o; with re&s;pect to the generality of mankind, it in no degree promotes the end, it an&s;wers no purpo&s;e at all. In any ordinary ca&s;e, every &s;en&s;ible man would chu&s;e the former method, as the only proper one. If you want to convince a per&s;on of the probability of any future event, you will naturally mention the &s;imilar pa&s;t events from which it derives its probability. You will not &s;urely think it nece&s;&s;ary or proper, to explain the foundation of our believing that the future will re|&s;emble the pa&s;t, to prove the &s;tability of the laws of nature, or to enlarge on the other topics which are very proper|ly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in philo&s;ophical &s;pecula|tions concerning the nature of our rea|&s;onings
<PB N="72" REF="112">
from experience. The ab&s;ur|dity of taking this method, would be perceived at one glance. If by the former method you fail of convincing a plain man, you &s;hall in vain hope to accompli&s;h it by having recour&s;e to the latter. That is indeed the method which is always employed by ordinary men, and which &s;ucceeds be&s;t with them: nay, it is con&s;tantly employed even by the mo&s;t &s;ubtile logicians, not only in ordinary life, but in all ca&s;es of &s;cience where their logical principles are not directly in their view; and it is a method &s;o perfectly adapted to the human under&s;tanding, that it often produces ready and unre&s;erved a&s;&s;ent in tho&s;e who&s;e logical principles would, by being recollected, tend to &s;ugge&s;t objections and create doubts. Rea|&s;oning of a &s;impler kind than what we have de&s;cribed, is &s;ometimes employed in proving matters of fact. When the
<PB N="73" REF="113">
evidence is only probable in a &s;light degree, there mu&s;t be an induction of many circum&s;tances, and many excep|tions mu&s;t be removed, before it can at all appear: but &s;o unfit are rea&s;on|ings of any con&s;iderable length or in|tricacy, for convincing the generality, that they can &s;carce enter into &s;ubjects of this kind. When multitudes of pro|babilities mu&s;t be accurately balanced again&s;t their contraries, it is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible to bring the generality to con|ceive any evidence, or to form any opinion in the ca&s;e. Rea&s;oning of all the kinds which have been menti|oned, has in cour&s;e of time been un|avoidably introduced into the defence of Chri&s;tianity: When unbelievers at|tempted to &s;how that Chri&s;tianity is improbable, it then became nece&s;&s;ary to collect and e&s;timate, both the cir|cum&s;tances from which its proof ari&s;es, and tho&s;e which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be
<PB N="74" REF="114">
contradictory; when they deduced ob|jections from ab&s;tract theories of evi|dence, it became nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer them, by arguments ari&s;ing likewi&s;e from a ju&s;t theory of evidence. But in originally proving the truth of the go&s;pel, this would have been ab&s;olute|ly unfit, becau&s;e by no means adapted to the conviction of the generality of mankind. Je&s;us cho&s;e the propere&s;t, nay the only proper method. He &s;im|ply propo&s;ed the evidences of the go|&s;pel as they were; he rea&s;oned not con|cerning their force; he did not &s;earch out every difficulty which a captious &s;pirit might lead men to apprehend in them, and give a particular an&s;wer to it. The method which he u&s;ed, is the fitte&s;t method for leading mankind to believe the go&s;pel; the contrary me|thod would have been ab&s;olutely im|proper. In this manner propo&s;ed, the evidence of the go&s;pel would mo&s;t ef|fectually
<PB N="75" REF="115">
produce belief, if it was real and &s;uited to human nature: if it was not fit to produce belief when thus pro|po&s;ed, no rea&s;oning could enable it to produce it in the bulk of mankind. Lay before an ordinary man, the evi|dences of the go&s;pel, in a plain man|ner; if he be not convinced by this, it will be to little purpo&s;e, to endeavour to convince him by a &s;ubtile di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of their force. To be convinced by the former, requires only his being a man; to gain conviction by the lat|ter, requires that he &s;hould have more|over become a philo&s;opher. The latter manner may give greater entertain|ment to the curious; but the former is the be&s;t and &s;horte&s;t way to conviction. It hath been &s;aid, with a de&s;ign to de|preciate the go&s;pel, that <Q REND="inline">"the apo&s;tles knew nothing of rea&s;oning, and would have been ea&s;ily entangled in a &s;yllogi&s;m<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chri&s;tianity not founded on argument, p. 37.</NOTE>."</Q> Be it &s;o. But is not
<PB N="76" REF="116">
this true of the generality of mankind, as well as of the apo&s;tles? Intricate rea|&s;oning would, therefore, have been improper in proving a religion intend|ed for the generality. Our Saviour's manner was &s;uch as enabled unlearned apo&s;tles, to addre&s;s the unlearned in a way the fitte&s;t po&s;&s;ible for producing conviction. If the evidences of the go&s;pel are &s;ufficient for conciliating belief, attention to the manner of pro|po&s;ing them, will naturally &s;trengthen that belief, for it is the be&s;t manner that could have been cho&s;en. God has adapted the evidence of the go&s;pel to the powers of the generality: Chri&s;t has propo&s;ed it in a manner &s;uited to its nature, and to their apprehen&s;ions: by this the go&s;pel is declared, not ob|&s;curely, to be the offspring of the &s;ame wi&s;dom which fixed the human con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="117">
It is not the only recommendation of our Saviour's manner, that it is the propere&s;t for producing conviction, and thus making evidence to an&s;wer its end. This manner is, likewi&s;e, mo&s;t &s;uitable to the character of Je&s;us as a divine teacher. It forms a &s;triking contra&s;t to the manner of impo&s;tors: it &s;ets Je&s;us in direct oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e who have attempted to deceive man|kind into the belief of fal&s;e religions. Impo&s;tors &s;tudiou&s;ly magnify very &s;len|der evidence: they can produce no &s;tronger; and therefore they labour to per&s;uade men, by every art, that what they have produced, is con&s;iderable. We would naturally expect, that a teacher really &s;ent from God, &s;hould on the contrary give evidence of his mi&s;&s;ion, fit in its own nature for pro|ducing belief; and that, con&s;cious of its inherent &s;trength, he &s;hould pro|po&s;e it without &s;how. In Mahomet
<PB N="78" REF="118">
we find the former manner, in Chri&s;t, the latter, in perfection. Mahomet was able to produce but very lame cre|dentials; and he endeavoured to give them weight by confident a&s;&s;ertions. He re&s;ted his credit almo&s;t entirely on the excellence of the Alcoran; he left not men to judge of this for them|&s;elves: to procure an acknowledgment of its excellence, he made the mo&s;t pompous encomiums on its perfection. He ventured not to work open mira|cles in confirmation of his mi&s;&s;ion: to &s;upply this defect, he boa&s;ted of many &s;ecret miracles wrought for him, of which there were no witne&s;&s;es, which therefore could be no evidence at all of his preten&s;ions, but needed evidence in order to gain credit to them&s;elves: and having, in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, done what he imagined might be magnified into a miracle, he repeatedly gloried in this, and u&s;ed all his art to exagge|rate
<PB N="79" REF="119">
it. He laid claim, in the mo&s;t o&s;tentatious manner, to the te&s;timo|nies of former prophets, not one of which however he was able to pro|duce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The imperfection of the evidence of Mahomet's mi&s;&s;ion, might afford room for many remarks; but at pre&s;ent we &s;peak only of the <HI>manner</HI> in which he urged that evidence.</NOTE>. Is not this very manner of &s;upporting his claim, a mark of im|po&s;ture, far from being equivocal? Can we avoid applying on this occa|&s;ion, what Je&s;us &s;aid to the Jews: <HI>If I bear witne&s;s of my&s;elf, my witne&s;s is not true</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John v. 31. chap. vii. 18.</NOTE>? He who, like Mahomet, re|quires men to believe his mi&s;&s;ion from God, wholly on his own te&s;timony, without giving them evidence of it, is plainly an impo&s;tor. How naturally mankind run into this judgment, we may perceive by recollecting the &s;light occa&s;ion on which the phari&s;ees &s;aid to Chri&s;t, <HI>Thou beare&s;t record of thy &s;elf; thy</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="120">
<HI>record is not true</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John viii. 13.</NOTE>. It was a ju&s;t &s;enti|ment applied improperly; their being &s;o forward to adopt it, when &s;ufficient occa&s;ion was not given, proves that it would have been very natural, if there had been an occa&s;ion. In every re&s;pect the manner of Je&s;us, already de&s;cribed, is perfectly the rever&s;e of Mahomet's. He gave real and &s;trong evidences of his mi&s;&s;ion; and he was not &s;tudious to &s;et them off: he &s;poke no more of them than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for &s;howing, that he intended they &s;hould an&s;wer this very purpo&s;e of proving his mi&s;&s;ion: he claimed only what he fully proved to belong to him: he a|vowed his real character, only &s;o far as was nece&s;&s;ary for the in&s;truction of his hearers: he often even declined a&s;|&s;erting that he was the Chri&s;t, and wanted that they &s;hould collect it from what they &s;aw and heard. Do we not
<PB N="81" REF="121">
here perceive the true features of a di|vine mi&s;&s;ion? When a man di&s;covers too great anxiety to gain credit, he is naturally &s;u&s;pected of an intention to deceive: one who is con&s;cious of the goodne&s;s of his cau&s;e, and de&s;igns not to bias the judgment, does not a&s;&s;ert on every occa&s;ion the &s;trength of his arguments; he propo&s;es them, and leaves them to &s;how their own &s;trength.

<P>Chri&s;t's manner of proving his mi&s;|&s;ion, &s;hows that he was con&s;cious of his title to the character which he claimed, and &s;ecure of the &s;ufficiency of the e|vidence which he gave. A per&s;on who knows that he intends to deceive, is naturally &s;u&s;picious, careful to &s;et off his arguments by every artifice, ready to fore&s;ee objections, and con&s;tantly &s;ollicitous to guard again&s;t them. This
<PB N="82" REF="122">
is di&s;cernible in almo&s;t every chapter of the Alcoran. This would have been the practice of Je&s;us, if he had been an impo&s;tor: and there can be little doubt, that the &s;ame abilities which were adequate to the invention of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem as the Chri&s;tian, would have been &s;ufficient for acting this part with great plau&s;ibility. But the prac|tice both of Je&s;us, and of his apo&s;tles, is perfectly the rever&s;e: <HI>he</HI> &s;hows no artifice, no forwardne&s;s to obviate e|very difficulty; and <HI>they</HI> relate things as they knew them to be, without any concern about the con&s;equences, with|out any anxiety to conceal &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, or to avoid &s;uch repre&s;en|tations, as &s;eemed even to give a han|dle for objections. This conduct bears the &s;tronge&s;t marks of that hone&s;t con|fidence which &s;prings only from a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of integrity, and is not con|&s;i&s;tent with an intention to deceive. It
<PB N="83" REF="123">
proves the&s;e per&s;ons to be what they &s;aid they were.</P>
<P>Simplicity of manner is an indica|tion, likewi&s;e, of genuine dignity.

<P>THUS we have endeavoured to a&s;|certain the manner in which the evi|dences of the go&s;pel were originally propo&s;ed: that manner appeared, on a &s;uperficial view, to be exceptionable; it was therefore fit to enquire into its propriety.

The vices and the prejudices of the Jews led them to form objections again&s;t the&s;e evidences, very early in our Saviour's mini&s;try, and very fre|quently through the cour&s;e of it. In addre&s;&s;ing the per&s;ons who formed the&s;e objections, or li&s;tened to them,

our Saviour departed from his ordinary method of &s;imply exhibiting evidence: he illu&s;trated the evidence which he had given, he urged it, he returned direct an&s;wers to their cavils. On &s;i|milar occa&s;ions, his apo&s;tles had re|cour&s;e to a &s;imilar method.

<P>THOUGH Je&s;us was very &s;paring in a&s;&s;erting his mi&s;&s;ion, and claiming the high character which belonged to him,
<PB N="89" REF="129">
when men &s;howed no di&s;po&s;ition to re|&s;i&s;t the evidence by which he &s;upported it; yet, on occa&s;ion of oppo&s;ition, he often avowed it in very peremptory and explicit terms; he affirmed that he was &s;ent by God, called God his Father, and him&s;elf the Son of God, a&s;|&s;erted the nece&s;&s;ity of believing him, and warned men of the danger of re|jecting him. When Nicodemus &s;how|ed him&s;elf di&s;&s;atisfied with his doctrine, he a&s;&s;erted his authority with the great|e&s;t boldne&s;s: <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto thee, We &s;peak that we do know, and te&s;tify that we have &s;een; and ye receive not our witne&s;s: And no man hath a&s;cended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii. 11, 13.</NOTE>: and he gave the plaine&s;t warning of the danger of not receiving his reli|gion; <HI>He that believeth not, is condemned already, becau&s;e he hath not believed in the</HI>

<P>THE internal evidence of Chri&s;tiani|ty, ari&s;es from its excellence: Je&s;us al|ways
<PB N="94" REF="134">
exhibited this evidence; all that he taught, had &s;triking characters of perfection. But, notwith&s;tanding the ab&s;olute purity of his doctrine, the Jews frequently found fault with it: and their cavils, &s;ometimes with re|&s;pect to this, and &s;ometimes too with re&s;pect to other topics, led him to il|lu&s;trate, to vindicate, and to urge, the excellence of the go&s;pel. Even when he an&s;wered them in the &s;imple&s;t manner, they gave him occa&s;ion to en|large more fully and clearly on parti|cular points, than he had done before; to rectify mi&s;takes; by the confuta|tion of them to in&s;til ju&s;ter principles; and thus to give a more ample exhibi|tion of internal evidence, to render the excellence of his religion more con&s;picuous.

more plainly; and thus taught doctrine; the excellence of which was more ob|vious, and therefore &s;itter for leading them to conclude of them&s;elves, that it was divine.

The me|taphor was perfectly familiar to them; therefore he thought it not nece&s;&s;ary to relinqui&s;h it: but he abundantly il|lu&s;trated his meaning, tho' he conti|nued to u&s;e the &s;ame figurative terms<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 49,&mdash;58.</NOTE>; he told them plainly, that by eating and drinking he intended believing on him<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 35, 40, 47, 64.</NOTE>; he informed them that his di&s;|cour&s;e
<PB N="96" REF="136">

On one occa&s;ion, when he was &s;peaking of his death, and his &s;ub&s;equent exaltation, they imagined that he intended to kill him|&s;elf. He corrected their mi&s;take, and &s;aid all that was nece&s;&s;ary for their comprehending his true meaning; he pointed out the &s;ource of their mi&s;take, he intimated that he came from hea|ven, that he was &s;ent by God, and e|ven that he was the Me&s;&s;iah, whom it was dangerous to reject; he informed
<PB N="97" REF="137">
them pretty plainly of his crucifixion, than which nothing could have a &s;tronger tendency to rectify their wrong opinion of a temporal Me&s;&s;iah; and all this in &s;uch a way, that <HI>many believed on him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John viii. 21,&mdash;30.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Jews were inveterately tainted with the expectation of a temporal Me&s;|&s;iah. This was often the immediate &s;ource, or the remote cau&s;e of their mi&s;takes of his meaning; what he &s;aid, was in its obvious &s;en&s;e contra|dictory to this expectation: In correct|ing their mi&s;takes, therefore, in the in|&s;tances already remarked, he general|ly gave &s;ome hints of the real character and office of the Me&s;&s;iah. Often like|wi&s;e, when they under&s;tood his mean|ing, the &s;ame prejudice hindered them from perceiving the excellence of his doctrine, or even led them to rai&s;e ob|jections again&s;t it, as incon&s;i&s;tent with
<PB N="98" REF="138">
what they took it for granted, was the truth. In both ca&s;es, Chri&s;t took an opportunity from their exceptions, to in&s;inuate, in different ways, ju&s;t &s;enti|ments of the &s;piritual nature, and the &s;everal real circum&s;tances of his king|dom. I &s;hall give a few in&s;tances more. He &s;aid in the very beginning of his mini&s;try, <HI>Except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii. 3.</NOTE>. Nicode|mus would have readily under&s;tood the expre&s;&s;ion, if it had been u&s;ed of a hea|then converted to Judai&s;m. But he imagined that it was the office of the Me&s;&s;iah, to bring all the world to em|brace the religion of Mo&s;es, not to call the Jews them&s;elves to embrace a new religion; and he was &s;o much bia&s;&s;ed by the imagination, that he could not at all comprehend the &s;en&s;e of the maxim, but an&s;wered, <HI>How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the &s;e|cond</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="139">
<HI>time into his mother's womb, and be born</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii. 4.</NOTE>? Our Saviour, in return, not only explained the doctrine which had given ri&s;e to the que&s;tion, by telling him very plainly, that he meant a &s;piri|tual, not a natural birth, and that the latter, tho' it were po&s;&s;ible, could have no fitne&s;s for an&s;wering the end of which he &s;poke<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 5, 6.</NOTE>; but al&s;o informed him, that he had in view conver&s;ion to a religion different from Judai&s;m, and explained the nature and de&s;ign of the whole go&s;pel, in &s;uch a way that its conformity to the Old Te&s;tament, and its intrin&s;ic excellence, appeared very &s;trikingly, and produced full convic|tion in Nicodemus<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 7,&mdash;21.</NOTE>. His own di&s;ci|ples were, for a long time, deeply tinctured with the &s;ame prejudices as the re&s;t of the Jews, and were led by them to take exceptions on particular occa&s;ions. When he fir&s;t began to in|form them of his approaching &s;ufferings
<PB N="100" REF="140">
and death, they were, in re&s;pect of the&s;e, perfect unbelievers; and Peter was &s;o much offended, that he blamed his ma&s;ter in a very indecent manner. On this occa&s;ion, Chri&s;t not only re|buked Peter, but taught them all, that the nature of his undertaking was very different from what they imagined it to be, and that the &s;ituation of his di&s;ciples would be quite unlike to what they expected; and &s;trongly inculca|ted the duties which that &s;ituation would require<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xvi. 21,&mdash;28. Mark viii. 31,&mdash;38. Luke ix. 22,&mdash;27.</NOTE>. By rea&s;on of the &s;ame mi&s;taken notion of a temporal kingdom, preferment was a&s;ked of Je|&s;us, for the two &s;ons of Zebedee. On this occa&s;ion too, he intimated the true nature of his kingdom; and likewi&s;e delivered the mo&s;t excellent in&s;truc|tions, di&s;&s;uading them from pride in all its forms, and teaching them that

true greatne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts only in genuine goodne&s;s, u&s;efulne&s;s, and humility<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xx. 20,&mdash;28. Mark x. 35,&mdash;45. Luke xxii. 24.,&mdash;27.</NOTE>. The excellence of &s;ome of his docu|ments, on the&s;e and other occa&s;ions, will be ea&s;ily perceived: but it is not perhaps unnece&s;&s;ary to remark, that, whenever he rectified their fal&s;e notions of the Me&s;&s;iah, and declared the true nature of his kingdom, he by this ad|ded great force to the argument for the truth of Chri&s;tianity, drawn from its excellence. Had the kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah been &s;uch as the Jews con|ceived it to be, it would have contain|ed no internal characters of divinity: it was a &s;cheme &s;carce worthy of God. But the real &s;cheme for the redemption of the world, to execute which the Me&s;&s;iah came, and to explain and pub|li&s;h which was the de&s;ign of his go&s;pel, was every way worthy of God, and
<PB N="102" REF="142">
bears in its e&s;&s;ential features, the &s;tronge&s;t marks of divine contrivance. His apo&s;tles, as well as him&s;elf, had frequent occa&s;ions, by rea&s;on of the oppo&s;ition which it met with, to en|large upon this topic, and by doing &s;o, to di&s;play the excellence of the go|&s;pel.</P>
<P>The excellence of doctrine is found|ed upon truth. No evidence can prove a doctrine to be from God, which plain|ly contradicts what we already know to be true. It was nece&s;&s;ary, there|fore, that our Saviour's doctrine &s;hould be con&s;i&s;tent both with former revela|tions, and with the genuine dictates of rea&s;on. During our Saviour's own life, the real nature of the go&s;pel was not &s;o perfectly under&s;tood by the Jews, as to beget an opinion of its incon&s;i&s;tence, except perhaps in &s;ome minute particulars, with the law of Mo&s;es. They began, however, very
<PB N="103" REF="143">
&s;oon after his a&s;cen&s;ion, to &s;u&s;pect that the go&s;pel was de&s;igned to overthrow the law: their accu&s;ation again&s;t Ste|phen, was, <HI>We have heard him &s;ay, that this Je&s;us of Nazareth &s;hall de&s;troy this place, and &s;hall change the cu&s;toms which Mo&s;es de|livered us</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts vi. 14.</NOTE>. But when the Gentiles were admitted into the Chri&s;tian church, without being &s;ubjected to the Jewi&s;h ceremonial, it was clearly perceived that the religion of Je&s;us was different from that of Mo&s;es. This was a capi|tal objection of the unbelieving Jews: a con&s;iderable part of the apo&s;tolical writings has a reference to it. The a|po&s;tles &s;how, that, tho' Chri&s;tianity be indeed different from Judai&s;m, and does abrogate it, yet it is not incon&s;i|&s;tent with it, in any &s;en&s;e that can affect the truth of either. The law was not intended to be perpetual; intimations were all along given, that it would be
<PB N="104" REF="144">
in due time &s;ucceeded by the go&s;pel. The&s;e are &s;trictly connected as parts of the &s;ame great &s;cheme: the law was the preparatory, the go&s;pel, the ulti|mate di&s;pen&s;ation; that was the &s;ha|dow, this the &s;ub&s;tance; that was the type, this the antitype. By enlarging on the&s;e and &s;imilar topics, the apo&s;tles give, not only a full view of the nature of Chri&s;tianity, but al&s;o ju&s;ter concep|tions of the nature of the law than the Jews had formerly; and they di&s;|play the excellence of both. Some|times the Jews found fault with our Saviour's doctrine, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the dictates of rea&s;on. A remarkable in&s;tance of this &s;ort is recorded by the evangeli&s;ts. When a paralytic man was brought to Chri&s;t at Capernaum, and let down by the roof of the hou&s;e, he &s;aid to him, <HI>Thy &s;ins are forgiven thee.</HI> The Scribes and Phari&s;ees cen&s;ured this expre&s;&s;ion as bla&s;phemous, as im|plying
<PB N="105" REF="145">
an inva&s;ion of the prerogative of God. Chri&s;t's an&s;wer is a &s;atisfying vindication of his doctrine. He &s;how|ed that the doctrine was true, becau&s;e the very miracle which he had wrought, was a plain proof and exemplification of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. ix. 2,&mdash;6. Mark ii. 3,&mdash;12. Luke v. 18,&mdash;25.</NOTE>. And when its truth was once e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, the more extraordinary it was, the more &s;trikingly it di&s;played the dignity of his character, the greatne&s;s of his undertaking, and the excellence of his go&s;pel.</P>
<P>When the go&s;pel came to be preach|ed by the apo&s;tles to the Gentiles, they rai&s;ed objections again&s;t it, which, though they were different in them|&s;elves, proceeded from cau&s;es &s;imilar to tho&s;e which influenced the Jews in the in&s;tances ju&s;t now mentioned. They had a high conceit of the anti|quity
<PB N="106" REF="146">
and extent of their own reli|gion: it contained nothing which could directly lead them to expect, that an alteration would be made in it by a divine revelation: they therefore objected again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, that it was an innovation, a <HI>new doctrine, bring|ing &s;trange things to</HI> their <HI>ears</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 19, 20.</NOTE>. In an&s;wering this objection, the apo&s;tles delivered doctrine which had real ex|cellence: they pointed out the fal&s;e|hood and ab&s;urdity of Pagani&s;m; they &s;howed that, on account of this, it ought certainly to be abandoned, and that therefore it ought not to ob&s;truct their receiving another religion, e&s;pe|cially a religion &s;o far &s;uperior as the Chri&s;tian<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 22,&mdash;31.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When the Jews could find no fault with what our Saviour had already &s;aid, they often put que&s;tions to him, on

purpo&s;e to lead him to utter &s;uch &s;enti|ments as were cen&s;urable, and might thus give them an opportunity of rai|&s;ing objections again&s;t his doctrine. On all the&s;e occa&s;ions he baffled their ma|lice, by delivering doctrines &s;o excel|lent as reflected new lu&s;tre on the truth of his religion. A lawyer came to him with an in&s;idious intention to di&s;|cover, whether he would teach any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with the law of Mo|&s;es, and &s;aid, <HI>What &s;hall I do to inherit e|ternal life?</HI> Je&s;us not only gave an an|&s;wer with which he could find no fault, but explained the extent of our duty to others, &s;o ju&s;tly, and in a manner &s;o wonderfully fit for touching the heart, as &s;ignally di&s;played his divine wi&s;dom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke x. 25,&mdash;37.</NOTE>. The Phari&s;ees a&s;ked him, with the like malicious intention, con|cerning the lawfulne&s;s of divorce. He proved the unlawfulne&s;s of this abu&s;e,

<P>As the objections which were rai&s;ed by unbelievers, gave Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles &s;ometimes occa&s;ions of illu&s;tra|ting and arguing from the internal marks of divinity, which Chri&s;tianity contains; &s;o, at other times, they led them to appeal to the miracles which were wrought in proof of it, and to rea&s;on from them in &s;upport of it. We may begin with ob&s;erving, that the ob|jections which were rai&s;ed, led Chri&s;t on many occa&s;ions to a&s;&s;ert that his miracles were wrought with an expre&s;s de&s;ign of proving his mi&s;&s;ion, to urge them as proofs of it, and thus to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a connexion between them and his doctrine.

Some of the Jews &s;aid, at another time, <HI>He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?</HI> and others in&s;inuated that he had not yet put it out of doubt, that he was the Chri&s;t: in con|futation of both, he &s;aid; <HI>The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear wit|ne&s;s of me</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. x. 20,&mdash;25.</NOTE>.

It was the &s;trong propen&s;ity of his own di&s;ciples, as well as of others, to incredulity, which moved him to declare beforehand the de&s;ign of his miraculou&s;ly rai&s;ing Lazarus from the dead: <HI>Lazarus is dead; and I am glad for your &s;akes, that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; neverthele&s;s let us go unto him</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. xi. 15.</NOTE>.

It is not nece&s;&s;ary to take notice particu|larly of the in&s;tances in which the apo|&s;tles, in con&s;equence of oppo&s;ition, urged the miracles wrought by Je&s;us, as proofs of his mi&s;&s;ion; or in&s;i&s;ted on the circum&s;tances which rendered them undeniable, their public nature, for in&s;tance, and their own knowledge of them: for as they preached in the name of Je&s;us, not in their own name, this was unavoidable, tho' no objec|tions had been moved again&s;t them. As the apo&s;tles wrought miracles them|&s;elves, &s;o it was ob&s;erved before, that they generally wrought them in the &s;ame &s;imple manner as their ma&s;ter: but the unbelief of tho&s;e who &s;aw them, and the oppo&s;ition and cavils which it

When the peo|ple who had &s;een two apo&s;tles heal a lame man, only wondered, in&s;tead of believing, Peter made an explicit de|claration of the intention and force of the miracle: <HI>Ye men of I&s;rael, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye &s;o earne&s;tly on us, as tho' by our own power or holine&s;s we had made this man to walk?

The objections of the Jews and Greeks at Corinth, which we

<P>Men were eye-witne&s;&s;es of the mira|cles which Chri&s;t performed; they could not therefore call their reality in que&s;tion: but they objected again&s;t their force; and thus gave him occa|&s;ion, by an&s;wering their objections, to &s;tate the evidence for the truth of Chri|&s;tianity, which miracles contain.

When he had <HI>healed one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a devil, blind and dumb, all the people were amazed, and &s;aid, Is not this the &s;on of Da|vid?

The rea&s;oning is &s;trong and unan&s;wer|able, and demon&s;trates that their a&s;|&s;ertion was even ab&s;urd. If the devil had enabled a per&s;on to work miracles, they would not have been &s;uch mira|cles as Je&s;us wrought, for many of the&s;e con&s;i&s;ted in di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing devils; nor would they have been wrought in con|firmation of &s;uch doctrine as Je&s;us taught, for it was mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to all that an evil &s;pirit would wi&s;h to be propagated in the world. Chri&s;t's mi|racles could not be performed by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the devil, for if they were, the devil mu&s;t have been intent on the de&s;truction of his own power, and the &s;ubver&s;ion of his own intere&s;ts. The a&s;&s;ertion was therefore ab&s;urd in it&s;elf, but it was peculiarly ab&s;urd in the mouth of Jews: they affirmed that ma|ny
<PB N="143" REF="183">
of their own nation had performed miracles by the power of God, and, on the te&s;timony of the&s;e miracles, ac|knowledged the&s;e to be divine me&s;&s;en|gers: it was the gro&s;&s;e&s;t incon&s;i&s;tence after this to a&s;cribe Chri&s;t's miracles to the devil; for his doctrine was as holy as theirs, and his miracles were much greater and more numerous, and con|&s;equently more undeniably derived from omnipotence. They ought with|out he&s;itation to a&s;cribe them to the Almighty, and to regard them as a full proof that Je&s;us was, what he claim|ed to be, the Me&s;&s;iah. They plainly proceeded from power &s;uperior to that of Beelzebub, and able to vanqui&s;h him; for they tended directly to overthrow his dominion. If it be a ju&s;t maxim, that he is to be regarded as an enemy who with-holds a&s;&s;i&s;tance, much more ought Chri&s;t to be con&s;idered as an e|nemy to the devil, when he was doing
<PB N="144" REF="184">
every thing to ruin his kingdom, both by his miracles them&s;elves, and by the doctrine for which he wrought them; the accomplice of the devil he could not po&s;&s;ibly be.</P>
<P>One of the apo&s;tles was obliged, not properly to prove the force, but to point out the real intention of a mira|cle which he had wrought, by a mi|&s;take of the &s;pectators which was very gro&s;s, but into which Pagans might na|turally run. The occa&s;ion was of a ve|ry peculiar nature; the illu&s;tration of the miracle was exactly &s;uited to it. <HI>There &s;at a certain man at Ly&s;tra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked.</HI> To him Paul &s;aid, <HI>Stand upright on thy feet.

<PB N="145" REF="185">
<HI>Paul, Mercurius, becau&s;e he was the chief &s;peaker. Then the prie&s;t of Jupiter which was before their city, brought oxen and gar|lands unto the gates, and would have done &s;a|crifice with the people.</HI> They acknow|ledged the miracle; they were &s;en&s;ible that it &s;howed a divine power re&s;iding in the per&s;ons by whom it was per|formed: but they had been inattentive to the doctrine which they preached; in&s;tead of con&s;idering the miracle ju&s;t|ly as a proof of that doctrine, they ha&s;tily explained it according to their own preconceived opinions. Certain that the miracle implied divine power, and accu&s;tomed to think only of the pagan deities, they immediately con|cluded that Paul and Barnabas were two of the&s;e. The apo&s;tles perceived their mi&s;take, and &s;et them&s;elves to rectify it. They had no need to in&s;i&s;t on the reality or the force of the mi|racle; the&s;e were acknowledged: the

particular point de&s;igned to be proved by it, was what had been mi&s;taken; they therefore explicitly determined this: they a&s;&s;ured the people that they were no divinities, that the miracle proceeded not from any of the heathen gods, who indeed had no exi&s;tence: they declared that its &s;ole intention was to atte&s;t the doctrine which they preached, that it proved its truth and divinity, and therefore ought to lead them to embrace it, renouncing their former idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition: <HI>They rent their cloaths, and ran in among the peo|ple, crying out, and &s;aying, Sirs, why do ye the&s;e things?

The mode&s;ty of Paul and Barnabas is both much greater, and much more indi&s;putable: if they had plea&s;ed, they might have been wor&s;hipped as Gods; they had no need to a&s;k it, they had need only to hold their peace: divine honours were urged upon them by the whole city of Ly&s;tra; they eagerly exerted them&s;elves to prevent it: and they never made a boa&s;t, either of the mode&s;ty or of the hone&s;ty of their conduct.</NOTE>.</P>

Miracles prove immediately the di|vine mi&s;&s;ion of the per&s;on who works them; and that mi&s;&s;ion once proved, gives authority to all the doctrines which he teaches in the name of God. But the Chri&s;tian miracles have more|over a direct and natural connexion with the particular doctrines of Chri&s;ti|anity, as they are exemplifications of them: and the objections which were rai&s;ed by the Jews, led Chri&s;t on &s;eve|ral occa&s;ions to point out this very con|nexion.
<PB N="148" REF="188">
One of the great doctrines of the go&s;pel is, That there is forgive|ne&s;s of &s;in through Chri&s;t, and that he is empowered by God to di&s;pen&s;e this forgivene&s;s to men. Chri&s;t proves this doctrine, by actually forgiving &s;in. Di&s;ea&s;es are the con&s;equences of &s;in, and part of the puni&s;hment of it; they are among tho&s;e effects of it, which lie mo&s;t open to the ob&s;ervation of men at pre&s;ent, and the removal of which they can mo&s;t readily perceive. Ma|ny of Chri&s;t's miracles con&s;i&s;ted in heal|ing various di&s;ea&s;es, and were thus the mo&s;t natural &s;pecimens which he could give of his power to forgive &s;in. One of them is repre&s;ented in this ve|ry light by him&s;elf. He &s;aid to a man &s;ick of the pal&s;y, <HI>Thy &s;ins be forgiven thee.</HI> This expre&s;&s;ion implied, that the mira|culous cure was an in&s;tance of his for|giving &s;in, and intended to be an ex|emplification of his power to forgive it.
<PB N="149" REF="189">
<HI>And certain of the Scribes &s;aid within them|&s;elves, This man bla&s;phemeth; who can for|give &s;ins but God alone?</HI> This mi&s;con&s;truc|tion led him to &s;tate the connexion between the miracle and the doctrine, explicitly and profe&s;&s;edly: <HI>Whether is it ea&s;ier to &s;ay, Thy &s;ins be forgiven thee? or to &s;ay, Ari&s;e and walk?

He thus affirmed, that his healing di&s;ea&s;es was intended to prove this truth, That the Son of man is em|powered to forgive &s;in: and it was the directe&s;t proof po&s;&s;ible; it made men to &s;ee with their eyes, that he did for|give it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah prophe&s;ies concerning the Me&s;&s;iah; <HI>Surely he hath born our griefs, and carried our &s;orrows</HI>; chap. liii. 4.

But Matthew affirms, that this prophecy was accompli&s;hed in Chri&s;t's curing the di&s;ea&s;es of men by miracle, chap. viii. 16, 17. <HI>He ca&s;t out the &s;pirits with his word, and healed all that were &s;ick; that it might be fulfilled which was &s;poken by E&s;aias the prophet, &s;aying, Him&s;elf took our infirmities, and bare our &s;ickne&s;&s;es.</HI> This has the appearance of being an im|proper application of the prophecy; at lea&s;t of being incon|&s;i&s;tent with Peter's interpretation of it. What has been &s;aid concerning the intention of this &s;pecies of miracles, removes the &s;eeming contradiction. They were not merely cures of bodily di&s;tre&s;&s;es: they were al&s;o proofs that Chri&s;t was em|powered to forgive &s;ins; they were declared &s;pecimens of that power to forgive the &s;ins of the world, which I&s;aiah directly foretold; take in their intention, and in re&s;pect of it they were the real accompli&s;hment of his prediction. By the&s;e miracles Chri&s;t &s;howed that he was the per&s;on who was to obtain for|givene&s;s of &s;in by his death, and con&s;equently &s;howed that he was the very per&s;on of whom I&s;aiah &s;poke.

Concerning &s;everal of the kinds of miracles wrought by Chri&s;t, it is at lea&s;t in&s;inuated on one occa&s;ion or an|other, that they were intended to be exemplifications, either of &s;ome parti|cular doctrine of his religion, or of &s;ome general quality and virtue of it. Di&s;ea&s;es may be con&s;idered in &s;everal lights, be&s;ides that of their being the con&s;equences, and the cha&s;ti&s;ements of &s;in: they are hurtful to the per&s;on who is &s;ubject to them, in various ways according to their different natures; and they are natural emblems of the &s;everal depravations of the &s;oul: and therefore the miraculous cures of par|ticular di&s;tempers, were likewi&s;e natu|ral emblems of the power of the go&s;pel to remove the depravations of mind corre&s;pondent to them; and in &s;ome in&s;tances they are repre&s;ented as &s;uch. Thus, Chri&s;t a&s;&s;erted, that he would remove the ignorance of men, and
<PB N="157" REF="197">
that his go&s;pel is the proper mean of il|luminating their under&s;tandings: to prove this, he frequently re&s;tored &s;ight to tho&s;e who wanted it. To convince men, that he could, as he affirmed, re|move the &s;piritual blindne&s;s of igno|rance and error, he cured that bodily blindne&s;s which is the mo&s;t natural image of it: and that the miracles of this kind, were peculiarly de&s;igned for convincing men of that, he in&s;i|nuates plainly enough on one occa&s;ion. On a Sabbath day, he <HI>&s;aw a man which was blind from his birth,</HI> and intended to cure him: as the Jews had often found fault with miracles wrought on the Sabbath day, he ob&s;erved, before he performed the cure, that the &s;hort time he would remain on earth, made it nece&s;&s;ary for him to take every op|portunity which occurred, of confirm|ing his divine mi&s;&s;ion by miracles: <HI>I mu&s;t work the works of him that &s;ent me,</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="198">
<HI>while it is day: the night cometh when no man can work</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John ix. 4.</NOTE>. In allu&s;ion to the par|ticular nature of the pre&s;ent miracle, he added; <HI>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 5.</NOTE>. By this he di|rected them to con&s;ider his re&s;toring &s;ight to the blind man, as a direct evi|dence of his being, in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, the luminary of the world. He had a&s;&s;umed the title in this &s;en&s;e, &s;o often before, that they could &s;carce overlook it: his principal intention in a&s;&s;uming it on this occa&s;ion, was, to repre&s;ent the miracle as an emblem of it, and a proof that it belonged to him; it is for this rea&s;on he in&s;erted the clau&s;e, <HI>as long as I am in the world;</HI> which, tho' it does not hinder the expre&s;&s;ion from be|ing applied to his general character, yet &s;hows that it was mo&s;t directly in|tended of tho&s;e miracles, of giving
<PB N="159" REF="199">
&s;ight to the blind, which were &s;en&s;ible &s;pecimens of that truth. He thus in|timates, that the fitne&s;s of his doctrine to enlighten the &s;oul with knowledge, and his re&s;toring the bodily eye to the perception of light, were clo&s;ely con|nected, that the former was the thing &s;ignified and confirmed, the latter the emblem and the proof, that the for|mer was in a manner the figurative meaning, the &s;piritual import of the latter, or rather the con&s;equence natu|rally deducible from it. This view of the &s;ame miracle, is likewi&s;e naturally &s;ugge&s;ted by what Chri&s;t &s;aid to the blind man him&s;elf, when he met him at the fea&s;t of Dedication, after the Jews had gone &s;o far as to excommuni|cate him: <HI>I am come into the world, that they which &s;ee not, might &s;ee, and that they which &s;ee might be made blind</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John ix. 39.</NOTE>; he plainly &s;peaks in allu&s;ion to the miracle.</P>

We are taught by the Chri&s;tian reli|gion, that Je&s;us is the author of eternal &s;alvation, and that the go&s;pel is the great mean of nouri&s;hing the &s;oul to eternal life: and to prove that he can give &s;piritual and eternal life, he &s;how|ed that he could miraculou&s;ly &s;upport the pre&s;ent life; he oftener than once fed &s;everal thou&s;ands with a very few loaves and fi&s;hes: and on one of the&s;e occa&s;ions he plainly in&s;inuated that he wanted the miracle to be con&s;idered in that very light.

<P>This kind of connexion between par|ticular miracles and particular doc|trines,

<P>IT was from the prophecies of the Old Te&s;tament that Je&s;us could be proved to be the Me&s;&s;iah. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould make &s;ome &s;ort of appeal to them, even

when there was no oppo&s;ition: but he was led by oppo&s;ition to urge this ar|gument more expre&s;sly and fully. His appeals to particular predictions as ful|filled in events relating to the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, were frequently occa&s;ion|ed by oppo&s;ition made to him. On one occa&s;ion he expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted that John the Bapti&s;t was the very per&s;on whom Malachi predicted, under the character of the forerunner of the Me&s;|&s;iah: <HI>But what went ye out for to &s;ee?

<PB N="171" REF="211">
had derived the idea of the Me&s;&s;iah whom they expected, from a partial view of the prophecies concerning him, e&s;pecially from a literal interpre|tation of the &s;everal figurative expre&s;|&s;ions in which his kingdom is de&s;cri|bed. On this account, they wholly overlooked &s;ome predictions relating to the times of the Me&s;&s;iah, and many e&s;&s;ential and important circum&s;tances of &s;uch predictions as they applied to the&s;e times: they were not compatible with the idea of the Me&s;&s;iah which they had ha&s;tily formed, and they did not &s;u&s;pect that idea to be faulty.

the Lord of David, who was dead ma|ny ages before, and who was the founder of the kingdom to which he only &s;ucceded; it followed nece&s;&s;arily from this prediction, that his character was totally different from what they imagined it to be.</P>
<P>The Jews having formed a wrong notion of the Me&s;&s;iah, they found &s;e|veral things in Je&s;us different from, or incon&s;i&s;tent with that notion, and con|&s;equently un&s;uitable to the prophecies in their apprehen&s;ion of them; and thence concluded that he was not the Me&s;&s;iah. This led him to &s;how, that the circum&s;tances of which they form|ed this judgment were really foretold of the Me&s;&s;iah, tho' their prejudice hin|dered them from perceiving them in the prophets, or that at lea&s;t they were not incon&s;i&s;tent with the predictions of the Old Te&s;tament.

&s;on of Jo&s;eph, and they reckoned this incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;ome ancient prophe|cies concerning the Me&s;&s;iah; probably with this prediction, <HI>Behold, a virgin &s;hall conceive, and bear a &s;on</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah vii. 14.</NOTE>; or with this, <HI>Who &s;hall declare his generation</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. liii. 8.</NOTE>? therefore they thought that Je&s;us could not be the Me&s;&s;iah: they &s;aid, <HI>Howbeit we know this man whence he is,</HI> we know who is his father; <HI>but when Chri&s;t cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.

In the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the demand was made imme|diately after an action which implied his a&s;&s;uming very great and extraordi|nary authority; and before this time he had been declared to be the Son of God by the miraculous te&s;timony at his bapti&s;m, he had been pointed out for the Me&s;&s;iah by John, who was owned to be a prophet, he had him&s;elf wrought &s;ome miracles, and he had ju&s;t done what may not improperly be con&s;ider|ed as partaking of the nature of a mi|racle. In the other two in&s;tances, the demand was almo&s;t immediately occa|&s;ioned by very &s;tupendous miracles,
<PB N="182" REF="222">
which he had performed. The&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, as well as the manner in which the demand it&s;elf is expre&s;&s;ed, naturally lead us to think, that it was not a great miracle in general, but &s;ome one determinate &s;ign, which they had in their eye, and which was pecu|liarly reckoned <HI>the &s;ign of the Son of man.</HI> It is &s;ometimes called <HI>a &s;ign from heaven,</HI> and we can &s;carce doubt, that they meant the very &s;ame &s;ign in all their different demands: this having been once refu&s;ed, they repeatedly a&s;ked it with an air of triumph, as if they ex|pected that it would be refu&s;ed, and thought that no evidence without it, could prove Je&s;us to be the Me&s;&s;iah. It is remarkable too, that Je&s;us con|&s;tantly refu&s;ed the &s;ign which they a&s;k|ed; and that his an&s;wer is always to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, tho' expre&s;&s;ed in dif|ferent ways, and never fails to include an intimation of his own re&s;urrection

Daniel had &s;aid concerning the Me&s;&s;iah, <HI>I &s;aw in the night-vi&s;ions, and behold one like the Son of man, came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him: and there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages &s;hould &s;erve him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daniel vii. 13, 14.</NOTE>. The Jews mi&s;took the &s;en&s;e of this prediction; they &s;eem to have concluded from it,
<PB N="184" REF="224">
that the Me&s;&s;iah would come down from heaven in vi&s;ible glory, in the character of a temporal prince, put him&s;elf at their head, and lead them forth to conquer all their enemies, and to erect an univer&s;al empire: and when|ever they a&s;ked a &s;ign from Je&s;us, their meaning was, that he &s;hould appear in this very manner. Indeed they had come to reckon &s;uch an appearance &s;o proper and determinate a mark of the Me&s;&s;iah, that it was a common peri|phra&s;is for his name. This is plain from what happened at our Saviour's trial: <HI>The high prie&s;t &s;aid, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us, whether thou be the Chri&s;t the Son of God.</HI> Je&s;us an|&s;wers in terms equivalent to tho&s;e of Daniel's prediction, <HI>Thou ha&s;t &s;aid: ne|verthele&s;s, I &s;ay unto you, Hereafter &s;hall ye &s;ee the Son of man &s;itting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxvi. 63, 64.

<PB N="185" REF="225">
This was intended to be a <HI>direct</HI> an&s;wer to the que&s;tion, and it was under&s;tood to be &s;uch. If this was their meaning, we may perceive how naturally they made the demand immediately after he had a&s;&s;umed extraordinary authority, or wrought great miracles: they were a&s;toni&s;hed by the&s;e, they could &s;carce help &s;u&s;pecting that Je&s;us was more than an ordinary per&s;on, though they were very unwilling to &s;uppo&s;e it: yet &s;till they mi&s;&s;ed in him, what they reckoned an e&s;&s;ential character, nay the preci&s;e characteri&s;tic of the promi|&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, his coming down from hea|ven in the manner defined by their in|terpretation of Daniel's prediction: they therefore a&s;ked him to put his claim out of doubt, by exhibiting this &s;ign. They might have been led to make this demand, not only by their unbelief, but al&s;o by &s;ome degrees of &s;u&s;picion, that Je&s;us would perhaps
<PB N="186" REF="226">
give this proof of his being the Me&s;&s;iah afterwards, though the time for it was not yet come: the latter of the&s;e cau&s;es had, it may be, &s;ome influence upon them when they made the demand at fir&s;t; but in the &s;ucceeding in&s;tances they were actuated &s;olely by the other. Our Saviour's refu&s;ing a &s;ign when it was demanded, has been a great &s;ubject of objections, and has particularly been alledged as a proof, that he was unwil|ling to give all the evidence of his mi&s;|&s;ion, which he might have given, or to &s;atisfy the under&s;tandings of men. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>The Phari&s;ees,</HI> it is &s;aid, <HI>tempting him, a&s;ked a &s;ign;</HI> that is, &s;ome te&s;timonial of the truth of his declared mi&s;&s;ion: And what did this reque&s;t produce?

<PB N="189" REF="229">
they were not impelled to make the demand even by a principle &s;o little blameable as <HI>light curio&s;ity,</HI> but were ac|tuated by perver&s;ene&s;s and prejudice, which had already made them with|&s;tand the cleare&s;t evidence, and the greate&s;t miracles, and which it was in vain to expect to conquer by working more miracles: It was therefore as rea|&s;onable to refu&s;e to work more, as it is, not to per&s;i&s;t in rea&s;oning with a man who &s;hows that he rea&s;ons only for the &s;ake of contention, without any con|cern to di&s;cover truth. But when we recollect what was the &s;ign which they de&s;ired, the objection is even ab&s;urd. It was a &s;ign which they were led to ex|pect, only by their fal&s;e notions of a temporal Me&s;&s;iah; it was ab&s;olutely in|con&s;i&s;tent with the truth of the Me&s;&s;iah's character; to have given it, would have been to become ju&s;t &s;uch a deli|verer as the Jews expected; it was
<PB N="190" REF="230">
therefore impo&s;&s;ible that it could be gi|ven. In&s;tead of giving it, it was proper to affirm expre&s;sly, as Je&s;us did affirm, that it never would be given, and that it did not belong to the Me&s;&s;iah ju&s;tly conceived. Whenever a &s;ign was a&s;ked, he appealed for the certainty of his mi&s;&s;ion, to his own re&s;urrection from the dead. So far was he from refu&s;ing <HI>any rational</HI> evidence of his mi&s;&s;ion, that even their perver&s;ene&s;s hindered him not from voluntarily pointing out the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t.</HI> His re&s;urrection was in it&s;elf the mo&s;t &s;tupendous miracle; and its force was increa&s;ed by its being in this manner appealed to, for it thus became the accompli&s;hment of prophecies ut|tered by him. But there is a farther propriety in his foretelling it, when they required a &s;ign: it was a plain in|&s;inuation, that their opinion of the manner of the Me&s;&s;iah's appearance was wrong, that he was not &s;uch a
<PB N="191" REF="231">
prince as they expected; for by it he informed them expre&s;sly, that he mu&s;t be put to death, before he entered on his kingdom. His an&s;wer was therefore fit for leading them to a ju&s;ter interpre|tation of Daniel's prophecy, and for preventing their rejecting the Me&s;&s;iah, becau&s;e he wanted a character which was never predicted of him. There is another occa&s;ion on which the Jews demanded a &s;ign. We have not yet taken notice of it, becau&s;e it may now be examined with greater advantage by it&s;elf. The day after he had fir&s;t miraculou&s;ly fed a great multitude, while he was teaching them in expre&s;|&s;ions borrowed from that miracle, and urging them to believe on him, <HI>they &s;aid unto him, What &s;ign &s;howe&s;t thou then, that we may &s;ee and believe thee? what do&s;t thou work</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John vi. 30.</NOTE>? They thus intimated, that it would be &s;oon enough to receive him as the Me&s;&s;iah, when he a&s;&s;umed the
<PB N="192" REF="232">
kingdom, in the manner which, they imagined, was fixed by Daniel's pre|diction, that without this, no miracles of another &s;ort could prove his claim; and they particularly in&s;inuated that his having given one meal to a multi|tude by miracle, was nothing extraor|dinary, but far inferior to Mo&s;es's ha|ving fed many more, for a longer time, with manna from heaven<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John vi. 31.</NOTE>. His di&s;cour&s;e on this occa&s;ion, is much larger and more complex than any of the an&s;wers which he gave to the &s;ame demand at other times. There are many rea&s;ons for this; they expre&s;&s;ed their contempt of the miracle of the loaves, as well as a&s;ked a &s;ign; he &s;pake figuratively, in allu&s;ion to that miracle, on purpo&s;e to inculcate its fitne&s;s for proving that he was impowered to be|&s;tow eternal life; &s;everal particular difficulties were moved in the cour&s;e of his &s;ermon; &s;o that his an&s;wer to
<PB N="193" REF="233">
the demand of a &s;ign, is inter&s;per&s;ed with a variety of other &s;ubjects. Many things, however, which he &s;aid, tend directly to &s;how them that they were mi&s;taken in the nature of the &s;ign which they expected, and to lead them into right apprehen&s;ions of the man|ner and de&s;ign of the Me&s;&s;iah's coming. Thus, tho' he came not down in the manner which, they imagined, Daniel had foretold, he a&s;&s;ures them &s;everal times, that he actually came from hea|ven<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John vi. 32, 33, 35, 38, 58.</NOTE>: particularly, when they in&s;inu|ated that this could not po&s;&s;ibly be, becau&s;e he was de&s;cended of earthly parents, he affirms very expre&s;sly that, this notwit&s;tanding, he did come down from heaven, and intimates that, by the ancient prophets, the Me&s;&s;iah ought not to come from heaven in &s;uch a way as they expected, which would have made the Jews flock to him ea|gerly, without the need of any extra|ordinary

The objection of the Jews was, How can he &s;ay, that he came down from heaven, when he was born of earthly parents whom we know? His an&s;wer is, <HI>No man can come unto me, except the Father which hath &s;ent me, draw him:&mdash;it is written in the prophets, And they &s;hall be all taught of God:</HI> How is their objection obviated by this re|ply? It is &s;omewhat indirect; the violence of their prejudices made it nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be &s;o; but it tended to warn them that they were prejudiced, without exa&s;perating them. 1. When we con&s;ider the an&s;wer in the mo&s;t general view, the a&s;&s;ertion that divine teaching was nece&s;&s;ary for their re|ceiving him as the Me&s;&s;iah, and the quotation of a pa&s;&s;age from the Old Te&s;tament, in which this teaching had been fore|told, implies a plain in&s;inuation, that it would not be altoge|ther &s;o ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h the Me&s;&s;iah, as they imagined, and that, &s;ince they ought to expect &s;ome difficulty, they &s;hould not be po&s;itive that he did not come down from heaven, merely becau&s;e they knew not exactly in what manner he did. 2. It had a &s;till more immediate relation to their objection. They expected that the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould de&s;cend from heaven in the vi&s;ible and glorious manner which we have already de&s;cri|bed, and this was the &s;ign which they demanded. But this &s;ign was &s;o accurately determined and &s;o minutely de&s;cribed by their doctors, that, if it had truly belonged to the Me&s;&s;iah, they mu&s;t have known him in&s;tantly, there could have been no room for doubt, and con&s;equently no need of divine teaching. By a&s;&s;ert|ing, therefore, the nece&s;&s;ity of this, he intimated that they were mi&s;taken concerning the nature of the &s;ign, that is, con|cerning the manner of the Me&s;&s;iah's de&s;cent from heaven; that no &s;uch deci&s;ive mark as they expected, would attend him; and that, on this account, they could not conclude from what they knew of his nativity, that he was not truly the Me&s;|&s;iah. 3. To be <HI>drawn by the Father,</HI> is commonly under&s;tood of men's being enlightened and convinced by the immediate influence of the divine Spirit; but it likewi&s;e naturally implies, their being taught by the ancient revelations which God had given. According to this &s;en&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion, the import of Chri&s;t's an&s;wer is: Ye cannot perceive me to be the Me&s;&s;iah, or to have come down from heaven, except ye under&s;tand the intimations of his character which God has already given by the prophets, except ye apprehend the true meaning of the predictions concerning him; ye mi&s;take their meaning in the particular to which your pre&s;ent objection refers, as well as in many others, ye ought therefore to &s;tudy them more care|fully; if ye do, ye &s;hall attain the knowledge of the real cha|racters of the Meffiah; for it is predicted, that in his time God will teach all who are di&s;po&s;ed to learn, and then ye &s;hall ea&s;i|ly get over the difficulties which now perplex you, for <HI>every man that hath</HI> in this manner <HI>heard and learned of the Father,</HI> will di&s;cern me to be the Me&s;&s;iah, and <HI>come unto me.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me: not that any man hath &s;een the Father, &s;ave he</HI> WHICH IS OF GOD, <HI>he hath &s;een the Father.&mdash;I am that bread of life: your fathers did eat manna in the wilderne&s;s, and are dead; this is the bread which</HI> COMETH

Finally, to this inti|mation he &s;ubjoins the following cau|tion, <HI>It is the &s;pirit that quickeneth, the fle&s;h profiteth nothing; the words that I &s;peak unto you, they are &s;pirit, and they are life</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 63.</NOTE>.

<PB N="199" REF="239">
their under&s;tanding the figurative ex|pre&s;&s;ions of the ancient prophecies, in too &s;trict and literal a &s;en&s;e; and, that his account of him&s;elf and his kingdom, was really agreeable to the &s;pirit and the true meaning of them.

It was very nece&s;&s;ary that Chri&s;t &s;hould put it beyond doubt, that he delivered his doctrine as a divine reve|lation, every part of which &s;tood on the authority of God.

But all who are not either very un|thinking, or very much prejudiced, may ea&s;ily perceive that this proceeds from a perfect mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of the nature of the go&s;pel. For Chri&s;t was led, by the oppo&s;ition which he met with, to a&s;&s;ert expre&s;sly and repeated|ly, that he was a teacher &s;ent from God, and to appeal for proof of it, to the evidences which he had produced. He thus delivered all his doctrines in the name of God; he claimed that all of them, without exception, &s;hould be received and believed; he left not e|very article to derive its credibility from a &s;eparate and peculiar proof; he
<PB N="234" REF="274">
gave one common proof for them all, the authority of a divine revelation. It is on this footing that his religion mu&s;t be tried: all the parts of it demand our belief, as being truths revealed by God; the rejection of any one article clearly taught in the go&s;pel, can be ju&s;tified only by proving, that the go|&s;pel is not a divine revelation, at lea&s;t that we have not &s;ufficient evidence of its being &s;uch. In examining, whether it be a revelation or not, its particular doctrines mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be con&s;idered: but they ought to be con&s;idered only in one light: you mu&s;t prove them to be po&s;itively fal&s;e and ab&s;urd, el&s;e you can draw no argument from them, a|gain&s;t the truth of Chri&s;tianity. If it be but <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> that, con&s;idered in them|&s;elves, they <HI>may be</HI> true, they leave the di|rect evidences of Chri&s;t's mi&s;&s;ion, in their full &s;orce; and whenever this mi&s;&s;ion is proved, it follows of cour&s;e, that all
<PB N="235" REF="275">
the doctrines contained in the go&s;pel <HI>are</HI> true. All objections again&s;t the&s;e doctrines, which do not infer their ab|&s;olute ab&s;urdity, are be&s;ide the pur|po&s;e. You &s;ay that rea&s;on gives no e|vidence of their truth; that, when you con&s;ider them &s;imply in them&s;elves, you can perceive no probability at|tending them: Be it &s;o; it is not nece&s;|&s;ary that it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e; it is affirmed only that they are revealed; and objections of this kind cannot prove that they are not, tho' they might ju&s;tify your not embracing them, if they were propo&s;ed merely as human opinions. You think that there are principles of rea&s;on, from which it may be inferred that they are impro|bable: but before you reject them on this account, you ought to be &s;atisfied, that there is greater certainty both of the truth of tho&s;e principles, and of the legitimacy of the con&s;equences de|duced

You cannot &s;ee that a revelation for di&s;covering them was nece&s;&s;ary, nor perceive what good end the di&s;covery of them has an&s;wered: but this is not what you are called to judge of: the proper que|&s;tion is, Have they been in fact reveal|ed? Has Chri&s;t, who taught them, pro|ved a mi&s;&s;ion from God? The &s;imple &s;tate to which Chri&s;t has reduced the que&s;tion concerning the truth of his religion, by claiming a divine mi&s;&s;ion &s;o explicitly, is, Whether there be &s;uf|ficient evidence that he actually had that mi&s;&s;ion? If there be, all his doc|trines mu&s;t be received at once. He had &s;o frequent occa&s;ions of in&s;i&s;ting on his having been &s;ent by God, that it &s;carce can be hone&s;tly overlooked: and attention to it, would confine the controver&s;y with Infidels within very

narrow limits; it would enable them to perceive, that many of their mo&s;t &s;pecious and popular rea&s;onings, their arguments, for in&s;tance, again&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of revelation, and mo&s;t of their objections again&s;t particular Chri|&s;tian doctrines, are nothing to the pur|po&s;e; it would &s;how them that, in or|der to overturn Chri&s;tianity, they mu&s;t evince, either that it has not the evidences which it pretends to have, or that, &s;uppo&s;ing it to have them, they are not &s;ufficient to prove its di|vinity; and that they mu&s;t evince this, not by nice &s;peculations on general to|pics, or by &s;tudied deductions from di&s;tant principles, but by a direct and clo&s;e examination, and confutation of the&s;e evidences them&s;elves. Attention to this, would indeed &s;horten all theo|logical controver&s;ies; it would cut off many &s;pecies of argumentation which all parties have employed in defence of

their peculiar tenets: for when Chri&s;t's mi&s;&s;ion is once acknowledged, the on|ly que&s;tion that can properly ari&s;e concerning any religious doctrine, is, Whether it be taught in &s;cripture, or not?

Sect. 3. A ju&s;t conception of the nature of that connexion which &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts between miracles and doctrines, &s;eems to throw &s;ome light on a que&s;tion which has been lately agitated with great warmth; the que&s;tion concerning the continuance of miracu|lous powers in the Chri&s;tian church. That the&s;e did con|tinue, and were exerci&s;ed by Chri&s;tians, for a con&s;iderable time after the age of the apo&s;tles, there are numerous te&s;ti|monies of the primitive writers. The te&s;timonies have many circum&s;tances of credibility. On the other hand, &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances have been taken notice of, which &s;eem to le&s;&s;en their weight. One is, that errors and corruptions had crept into the church, in the period during which miraculous pow|ers are &s;aid to have remained, that they were patronized by tho&s;e who exerci&s;ed &s;uch powers, that therefore they mu&s;t be admitted for truths, if the reality of the&s;e powers be acknow|ledged. But this con&s;equence by no means follows. Mira|cles prove the truth, not of all the opinions of the per&s;on who works them, but of tho&s;e doctrines which he profe&s;&s;es to have received by revelation, and in atte&s;tation of which he declares them to have been wrought. The miracles performed by the prophets and apo&s;tles, did not prove them to be infalli|ble in all things, but only in the particular doctrines which they delivered as from God, and for proof of which they ap|pealed to their miracles. In like manner, &s;uppo&s;e &s;ucceeding Chri&s;tians to have exerci&s;ed the miraculous powers a&s;cribed to them; the&s;e miracles can be proofs only of the doctrines for the confirmation of which they declare that they exerci&s;ed them, not of any of their other particular opinions, which they &s;upported, not by an appeal to miracles, but by evidences to|tally di&s;tinct. In order, therefore, to determine what it is that their miracles prove, we mu&s;t examine what is the pur|po&s;e for which they &s;ay that they were intended. Now, with re&s;pect to almo&s;t all the miracles which are &s;aid to have been wrought for the three fir&s;t centuries, we may ob&s;erve, that they are mentioned chiefly in the Apologies for Chri&s;tianity, that they are expre&s;sly declared to have been wrought only for the confirmation of Chri&s;tianity as contained in the New Te&s;ta|ment, that they are con&s;tantly repre&s;ented in this preci&s;e point of view, as &s;tanding monuments of the truth of the go|&s;pel. The truth of the go&s;pel, therefore, is all that will fol|low from the &s;uppo&s;ition of their reality. The fathers held many errors; their miracles oblige us not, to admit any of the&s;e; for they are not pretended to have been wrought in proof of any of them: they &s;ometimes deduce the&s;e opinions from &s;cripture, in the exerci&s;e of their own rea&s;on, and &s;ome|times inform us, that they learned from tradition that &s;ome of the apo&s;tles had taught them; and we are at liberty to try them, by &s;crutinizing the&s;e evidences: they may be fal&s;e, and yet all the alledged miracles real. Some things have indeed been affirmed, which &s;eem to imply that &s;ome of the primitive writers urge miracles in &s;upport of their own private opinions. Let us examine a few of the principal of the&s;e. It has been &s;aid, that Ju&s;tin a&s;&s;erts that he him&s;elf had a miraculous gift of expounding the &s;criptures, and that we cannot give credit to him without adopting all his expo&s;itions. But he really claims no &s;uch gift. When he &s;ays, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> (Dial. cum Tryph. page 280.) his words imply, not any claim to in&s;piration, or to a &s;upernatural knowledge of the &s;criptures, but only a thankful acknowledgment of that general knowledge of the doctrines taught in them, which Chri&s;tians may acquire by ordinary means, and which may be ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to the grace or kindne&s;s of God. He &s;ays a|gain, (ibid. page 326,) <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">. That he means not any peculiar revelation made to him&s;elf, we would naturally conclude from the bare in&s;pection of the&s;e words; and that he truly means only the Chri&s;tian revela|tion in general, is put beyond all doubt by the &s;entence im|mediately preceeding, from which this is a profe&s;&s;ed deduction:
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, &amp;c. He &s;ays in another place, (ibid. page 346.) <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">; This al&s;o plainly relates, not to any &s;upernatural gift be&s;tow|ed upon him&s;elf, but to the light which the New Te&s;tament revelation had thrown on the ancient prophecies: for he had ju&s;t before quoted &s;ome predictions, mo&s;t of which are applied to Chri&s;t in the New Te&s;tament; he had a&s;&s;erted that Gen|tiles had now more perfect knowledge of the &s;criptures than the Jews them&s;elves, and he had a&s;&s;erted that they owed this to the calling of the New and everla&s;ting Te&s;tament. The que&s;tion followed naturally, Could we Gentiles under&s;tand all the&s;e things in the &s;criptures, if we had not received grace to do it? To &s;how that the grace which he intends, is God's kindne&s;s in calling the Gentiles, while he rejected the Jews, he proceeds immediately to quote predictions of the&s;e events. Se|veral pa&s;&s;ages are likewi&s;e produced for proving, that Cyprian endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome particular opinions or practices, by pretending that he was directed to them by vi&s;ions and &s;u|pernatural admonitions. Of the&s;e there is one which does imply &s;uch a pre~tence: but this is a claim to &s;uch in&s;piration as would need miracles for proof of it, more properly than an appeal to any miracle as an evidence of truth; it is not therefore to the purpo&s;e: be&s;ides, in this ca&s;e, a man of a warm temper might more ea&s;ily deceive him&s;elf, or a de&s;ign|ing man might more &s;ecurely make a fal&s;e pretence, than in open miracles which are the objects of men's &s;en&s;es. But in|deed mo&s;t of the pa&s;&s;ages produced, imply no pretence to in|&s;piration. He &s;ays, for in&s;tance, that God had commanded that a mixture of wine and water &s;hould be u&s;ed in the Lord's &s;upper: he means, commanded in &s;cripture; for it is from pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture that he attempts to prove it. He &s;ays concerning his flight from per&s;ecution, that the Lord com|manded him to retire; he adds not, <HI>in a vi&s;ion</HI>; and there is a written direction of our Saviour, Matth. x. 23. &s;ufficient to warrant his expre&s;&s;ion. He &s;peaks of two per&s;ons who were &s;et apart for pre&s;byters, <HI>divina dignatione</HI>; they were eminent for goodne&s;s, they had &s;hown great &s;teadine&s;s in per&s;ecution, one of them recovered after having been half burnt by his per|&s;ecutors; Cyprian regarded the&s;e things as declarations of pro|vidence in their favour; all that he &s;ays of them, &s;hows that he meant no more. It is plain then that the declared inten|tion of the miracles &s;aid to have been wrought in the primitive church was, not the e&s;tabli&s;hment of particular opinions or practices, but &s;imply the confirmation of Chri&s;tianity. Sup|po&s;e them real, the truth of the go&s;pel is all that follows. When miracles were urged in proof of particular tenets, we may take it for granted that they were merely pretended; when they came to be thus urged very commonly, real mi|racles had then either cea&s;ed in the church, or become very rare. When the &s;criptures were compleated, God had given men the whole rule of faith which he intended; he left them to collect their religion from them, in the u&s;e of their own fa|culties; he empowered none any longer to work miracles for e&s;tabli&s;hing new doctrines; all pretences to &s;uch were mere impo&s;ture. For the propagation of Chri&s;tianity among un|believers, miracles might notwith&s;tanding continue nece&s;&s;ary; how long they did continue to be wrought for this purpo&s;e, mu&s;t be determined by hi&s;torical evidence.</NOTE>. It was very nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, that the intention of the Chri&s;tian miracles &s;hould be plainly declared. Infidels have been forward in all ages, to re|pre&s;ent them as mere exertions of pow|er or &s;kill, which do not infer the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion. With this view chiefly, Cel&s;us collected the fabu|lous miracles of Ari&s;teas, Abaris, Her|motimus, Cleomedes, and remarked that they were not, on account of the&s;e, con&s;idered by any as gods or divine per&s;ons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Origen. cont. Cel&s;um. lib. 3.</NOTE>: and with the &s;ame
<PB N="240" REF="280">
view, Hierocles compared Chri&s;t to Apollonius Tyanaeus, and extolled the judgment of the Pagans, who, tho' they believed the marvellous exploits of the latter, did not therefore reckon him a God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;eb. cont. Hieroclem.</NOTE>. If Chri&s;t had never profe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="241" REF="281">
that he wrought his miracles with a de&s;ign to confirm his doctrine, they would indeed have had no connexion with its truth: if he had not a&s;&s;erted this very frequently and explicitly, In|fidels might have di&s;&s;embled that con|nexion

with &s;ome degree of plau&s;ibili|ty. But the oppo&s;ition which he met with, gave him &s;o many occa&s;ions of a&s;&s;erting it, and in&s;i&s;ting upon it, that it cannot po&s;&s;ibly be overlooked by a|ny man of candour, and needs no o|ther

proof, but an appeal to the plain expre&s;&s;ions of the go&s;pel hi&s;tory. When therefore a late writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chri&s;tianity not founded on argument, p. 46, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> has a&s;&s;erted that Chri&s;t's miracles were never in|tended by him for evidences of his mi&s;&s;ion, we can only wonder at his

boldne&s;s: he pretends to prove it by arguments; but we may be certain that they cannot po&s;&s;ibly be conclu|&s;ive: It is a plain fact, that Chri&s;t did, in many in&s;tances, urge his miracles as proofs of his mi&s;&s;ion and doctrine: no

<P><PB N="246" REF="286">
That Je&s;us was a divine teacher, might have been proved by other ar|guments; that he was the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, could be proved only from the prophecies of the Old Te&s;tament. The agreement of the&s;e to him and his religion, is &s;o accurate, and extends to &s;o many particulars, that it might have convinced an attentive inquirer, that he was indeed the Me&s;&s;iah, tho' he had never affirmed it, or made an appeal to prophecy. But his neglect|ing this altogether, would have been in &s;ome mea&s;ure unaccountable; it would have rendered this proof of his mi&s;&s;ion &s;omewhat feeble, and con&s;ide|rably intricate; there might have been a &s;how of rea&s;on for a&s;&s;erting, that he only claimed to be an ordinary divine teacher, but a&s;&s;umed not the high cha|racter of the Chri&s;t. But he did in fact, on occa&s;ion of the objections which were made, appeal very frequently to
<PB N="247" REF="287">
the ancient prophets, apply their ora|cles to him&s;elf, rea&s;on from them, &s;how that they were accompli&s;hed in him|&s;elf, and affirm that he was the very per&s;on intended by them. It cannot, therefore, be even pretended, that he ought to be regarded only as a common prophet: if he be at all a divine teach|er, he mu&s;t be the Me&s;&s;iah; the proof that this character belongs to him, &s;tands in full &s;trength, and is as &s;hort and clear as it po&s;&s;ibly could be.</P>
<P>Thus if our Saviour and his apo&s;tles had never employed that manner which they did employ on occa&s;ion of oppo|&s;ition, it might have given a handle for &s;ome plau&s;ible objections again&s;t the go&s;pel: it is a great advantage that there remains no colour for the&s;e; it ren|ders the truth of Chri&s;tianity more im|mediately evident, and the defence of it ea&s;ier. Infidels are forward to lay hold of every difficulty attending revela|tion,
<PB N="248" REF="288">
and to turn it into an argument again&s;t its truth. A true revelation, they argue, if there ever was one, is of &s;o great and general importance, that it would not be con&s;i&s;tent with the goodne&s;s and perfection of God, to leave it expo&s;ed to difficulties, which may be in&s;uperable to &s;ome men, and occa&s;ion their rejecting it. The argu|ment is perfectly fallacious; it runs counter to the whole analogy of na|ture. It is however in &s;ome degree &s;pecious: and its being &s;o, &s;hows that the principles of human nature di&s;po&s;e us to regard a freedom from difficul|ties, as one rea&s;on for thinking fa|vourably of any &s;cheme of religion. When, therefore, Chri&s;tianity &s;tands clear of &s;o con&s;iderable difficulties, by the manner of its publication, it is rea|&s;onable to con&s;ider this as &s;ome indi|cation of its truth. It is, at lea&s;t to a certain degree, what men would wi&s;h
<PB N="249" REF="289">
a true revelation to be, and what Infi|dels judge it rea&s;onable to expect that it &s;hould be. This is an indication of its truth, the &s;tronger becau&s;e the dif|ficulties effectually prevented, are &s;uch as would have unavoidably ari&s;en from the &s;ole u&s;e of that method which was originally and mo&s;t ordinarily employ|ed, and becau&s;e they are prevented in a con&s;i&s;tence with the advantages re|&s;ulting from that original manner.</P>
<P>FURTHER, as the manner in which Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles &s;upported their mi&s;&s;ion, when they met with oppo&s;i|tion, prevents &s;ome objections, &s;o it re|moves others. In con&s;equence of it, we have their own repre&s;entation of the nature and force of the evidences pro|duced by them, and their own an&s;wers to &s;everal of the objections which have been moved again&s;t the truth of Chri|&s;tianity. This cannot fail to be high|ly
<PB N="250" REF="290">
agreeable to the curious and inqui|&s;itive. It is not only agreeable. By means of it, con&s;iderable progre&s;s is made in the defence of Chri&s;tianity. Its evidences cannot fairly be rejected, till the repre&s;entations of their force, gi|ven by Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles, be fir&s;t invalidated; the &s;ame objections cannot fairly be repeated, till the an|&s;wers which they have already given to them, be fir&s;t refuted. This has, how|ever, been &s;carce at all attempted by Infidels. There can be no &s;tronger evi|dence of want of candour. Indeed, &s;ince there have been &s;o many defences of Chri&s;tianity, it would not be altogether unrea&s;onable to expect, that Infidels &s;hould not revive any objection, with|out &s;howing all the an&s;wers already given, to be in&s;ufficient: But it is pe|culiarly inexcu&s;eable, to overlook tho&s;e an&s;wers to objections, which the New Te&s;tament contains. They cannot be
<PB N="251" REF="291">
ignorant of the&s;e, if they only read the New Te&s;tament; it is in it that Chri&s;tianity is taught, and therefore to oppo&s;e Chri&s;tianity without reading it, is alike ab&s;urd and di&s;ingenuous. To know the&s;e an&s;wers, and yet to take no notice of them, is as little con&s;i&s;tent with the love of truth. Had Infidels pur&s;ued the track which this principle naturally points out, it would have probably prevented &s;ome of their ob|jections; for Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles gave an&s;wers to the objections which were propo&s;ed to them; and in every in&s;tance, it may be &s;afely left to any per&s;on who will examine them, to de|termine on which &s;ide the &s;trength of argument lies. But if they thought not the&s;e an&s;wers &s;ufficient, it was plainly incumbent on them to have confuted them, before they could be at liberty to urge the &s;ame objections. If they have declined this labour, it &s;hould in rea|&s;on
<PB N="252" REF="292">
prejudice their cau&s;e; it cannot promote it. It expo&s;es their impartia|lity to ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion; it intimates a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their inability to reply; it is an acknowledgment of the &s;olidity of the an&s;wers: at any rate, it renders their oppo&s;ition faulty in its very foun|dation. They have left a &s;trong enemy behind, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fortre&s;s which they found impregnable, and, on that account, all their advances are in&s;ecure, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;es but apparent. Till the original an&s;wers be fairly confuted, the repetition of the objections is mere trifling. But when they are repeated, &s;o long as the New Te&s;tament remains, Chri&s;tians have the ready means, both of removing them, and of &s;howing the impropriety of their being urged. They have not this advantage only. The an&s;wers recorded in the New Te|&s;tament are &s;o natural, that they would have no doubt occurred, whenever the
<PB N="253" REF="293">
objections had been rai&s;ed; and they are &s;o full, that they could &s;carce have failed to &s;atisfy the rea&s;on of men, by whom&s;oever they had been given: But being given by Je&s;us and his apo&s;tles, Chri&s;tians, who are already convinced of their mi&s;&s;ion by di&s;tinct and inde|pendent arguments, mu&s;t re&s;t in them with peculiar a&s;&s;urance, and be, by means of them, greatly confirmed in their faith. Their utility extends be|yond the confutation of the particular objections which gave ri&s;e to them; they are models to Chri&s;tians for an|&s;wering many others; and they pro|ceed upon principles of &s;o general in|fluence, that they are even immediate|ly applicable to many objections which had not then been profe&s;&s;edly urged. In every defence of Chri&s;tianity, we may find numerous in&s;tances, in which the rea&s;onings of the New Te&s;tament have been made, in this very manner,
<PB N="254" REF="294">
to contribute greatly to the illu&s;tration of the truth of our religion. In a word, in con&s;equence of Je&s;us having been led to &s;upport and enforce the eviden|ces of his mi&s;&s;ion by rea&s;oning, we have an opportunity of &s;eeing him ri&s;e &s;upe|rior to all oppo&s;ition, of &s;eeing the vic|tory of argument over &s;ophi&s;try and cavil, of ob&s;erving, in the go&s;pel, the genuine triumphs of divine truth.</P>
<P>THE manner of propo&s;ing the evi|dences of Chri&s;tianity, which Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles adopted on occa&s;ion of oppo&s;ition, not only contributes to fa|cilitate the defence of our religion; it was nece&s;&s;ary for doing full ju&s;tice to its evidence. There are two ways in which the &s;trength of evidence may be made to appear. It &s;hows its &s;trength directly, when it produces ready and firm belief. But it cannot always &s;how its &s;trength in this manner; prejudice
<PB N="255" REF="295">
or &s;ome other cau&s;e may prevent the &s;tronge&s;t evidence from producing its effects on &s;ome men, and may &s;ugge&s;t objections again&s;t it. It is proved to be, notwith&s;tanding, &s;trong, when it is &s;hown by rea&s;oning, that it ought to have produced belief. This is the on|ly way in which its power can be made known to tho&s;e, who do not feel it by its operation on their under&s;tandings. Strong evidence requires not a great deal of rea&s;oning, to enable it to gain the a&s;&s;ent of a &s;ound under&s;tanding; but evidence mu&s;t be &s;purious, if it ad|mit not a vindication by rea&s;oning, from all the objections that can be rai&s;ed again&s;t it. The evidences of Chri&s;tiani|ty were called in que&s;tion; objections were formed again&s;t them; attempts were made to elude their force, by ca|villing at &s;ome of the circum&s;tances which attended them. Je&s;us confuted the objections, by argument; he ex|po&s;ed
<PB N="256" REF="296">
the weakne&s;s of the cavils; he &s;howed that they affected not his cre|dit, and that, in &s;pite of them, the evi|dences which he had given, remained conclu&s;ive and &s;ufficient. By the&s;e means he made it plain, that the faith which the &s;imple exhibition of them had produced, was not the offspring of credulity, that it was perfectly legi|timate, and that the unbelief of others proceeded altogether from them&s;elves, not from any defect of evidence. It is often impo&s;&s;ible to convince a per&s;on, who may yet be proved to be undeni|ably in the wrong: the rea&s;onings of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles &s;how that this was the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed them.</P>
<P>REASONINGS in &s;upport of the evi|dences of the go&s;pel, were in &s;ome re|&s;pect nece&s;&s;ary, likewi&s;e, for procuring it a reception. The exhibition of the&s;e
<PB N="257" REF="297">
evidences was &s;ufficient for the con|viction of the hone&s;t and attentive; it was the propere&s;t for their conviction. But the mere exhibition of evidence is not, in any ca&s;e, &s;ufficient for the con|viction of all. Some are inattentive; &s;ome are prejudiced; &s;ome love ex|ceedingly to be amu&s;ed with rea&s;oning, and &s;et a high value upon it; we find &s;ome men even &s;o much addicted to doubt and di&s;putation, that they will &s;carce be convinced by the &s;tronge&s;t e|vidence, except it be enforced by rea|&s;oning. By an argumentative di&s;play or vindication of evidence, many may be convinced, who would not have be|lieved without it. Medicine is as ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the di&s;ea&s;ed, as food is to the &s;ound. The incredulous labour under an intellectual di&s;temper which can be removed only by explaining the force of the evidence, and an&s;wering their objections. If Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles
<PB N="258" REF="298">
had not &s;ometimes taken this way, it would have been regarded by many as a very &s;trong prejudice again&s;t their mi&s;&s;ion. The objection would not have been &s;ubver&s;ive of Chri&s;tianity, provi|ded they had exhibited real and natu|tural evidence; for we are not qualifi|ed for determining, what preci&s;e <HI>degree</HI> of proof, it is fit that God &s;hould give in matters of religion. But the objec|tion would have had &s;ome force; it would have &s;eemed to imply a neglect of <HI>the &s;ick</HI> who <HI>need a phy&s;ician.</HI> When men think that they have rea&s;ons a|gain&s;t believing on any &s;ubject, after the natural evidence has been pre&s;ent|ed to them, the only po&s;&s;ible way of o|vercoming their unbelief, is, to prove that their rea&s;ons are not good. When heedle&s;sne&s;s, prejudice, or a captious &s;pirit, hinder men from perceiving the force of clear evidence, the natural means of enabling them to perceive it,
<PB N="259" REF="299">
are, to excite their attention, to direct them to con&s;ider it in the proper point of view, and to &s;olve their difficulties. Had not Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles u&s;ed the&s;e means, when the oppo&s;ition of argument naturally demanded it, there would have been &s;ome cau&s;e to &s;ay, that they did not all they might have done for the conviction of tho&s;e who were unhappily prejudiced again&s;t them. But, be the objection ever &s;o &s;trong, be it in&s;urmountable, if you plea&s;e; Chri|&s;tianity has no concern with it. The oppo&s;ition rai&s;ed by unbelievers, gave the founder and the fir&s;t publi&s;hers of this religion, many opportunities, the propere&s;t that could be, for confirming the truth of their mi&s;&s;ion by rea&s;oning; and they u&s;ed the&s;e opportunities for that very purpo&s;e. It is not more plain, that they made no o&s;tentation of argu|ment when it was not nece&s;&s;ary, than it is, that they never neglected to u&s;e it
<PB N="260" REF="300">
when it was nece&s;&s;ary: they thus did all that could po&s;&s;ibly be done for the conviction of men; if any notwith|&s;tanding remained in unbelief, it was wholly owing to them&s;elves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There were, perhaps, &s;ome objections propo&s;ed to Je&s;us, which he did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to confute. Thus, when &s;ome of the people were di&s;po&s;ed to own him for the Me&s;&s;iah, and &s;aid, <HI>Of a truth this is the prophet, this is the Chri&s;t</HI>; others rai&s;ed an objection, which would have been in&s;urmountable, if it had not ari&s;en from a mi&s;take of fact; they &s;aid, <HI>Shall Chri&s;t come out of Galilee? Hath not the &s;cripture &s;aid, That Chri&s;t cometh of the &s;eed of David, and out of the town of Beth|lehem where David was?</HI> John vii. 40,&mdash;42. We are not informed, that Je&s;us made any an&s;wer. It is not, however, certain that he made none; the evangeli&s;ts record not all that he &s;aid. But if he made none, it cannot be thence concluded, that he declined giving all rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction to his oppo|&s;ers. An an&s;wer was not nece&s;&s;ary. They might ea&s;ily learn, that he was really born at Bethlehem, and of the family of David, it was generally known; it had been rendered noto|rious by the national inrolment, by the inquiries of the Magi, and by Herod's &s;laughter of the infants: none of the Jews needed to remain ignorant of it, if they had a de&s;ire to know the truth. His informing them of the place of his birth, would have &s;erved no other purpo&s;e, but to an&s;wer this cavil; it would have given no new light or force to the evidence of his mi&s;&s;ion. It is enough that he readily an&s;wered objections, when it was truly u&s;eful, e&s;pecially when it gave an opportunity of in&s;inuating fre&s;h evidence; it was in no way nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould enter into a minute examination of every frivolous ob|jection; he was too &s;ecure of his mi&s;&s;ion, to dread any ill con|&s;equence from declining this.</NOTE>. The New Te&s;tament contains &s;o many in|&s;tances of their having actually rea&s;on|ed in defence of their mi&s;&s;ion, as mu&s;t &s;atisfy every per&s;on who only reads it,
<PB N="261" REF="301">
that all the advantages which any &s;y|&s;tem can derive from its being &s;upport|ed by rea&s;oning, actually belong to Chri&s;tianity. That Je&s;us &s;howed an in|capacity for rea&s;oning; that he owed his &s;ucce&s;s to his having addre&s;&s;ed only the weak and credulous; that he &s;atis|fied him&s;elf with impo&s;ing upon the&s;e; that, whenever he met with men of pe|netration, who di&s;covered the impo|&s;ture, and were willing to expo&s;e it, he was glad to be &s;ilent, and to make no attempt to convert them; that he knew he could not &s;atisfy them, and was a|fraid le&s;t, by contending with them,

he &s;hould only render the weakne&s;s of his cau&s;e the more notorious; the&s;e are a&s;&s;ertions in which infidels would have triumphed.

Evidence of the truth of the go&s;pel, was given in abundance; it was enforced and vindicated by rea&s;oning, whenever there was occa&s;ion.

<P>BUT is not Chri&s;t's having been at

&s;o great pains to &s;upport the evidences of his mi&s;&s;ion, incon&s;i&s;tent with the ac|count formerly given, of the manner in which he originally propo&s;ed them, and &s;ubver&s;ive of the conclu&s;ions de|duced from it? It has been &s;hown, that his ordinary re&s;erve, his not being for|ward to multiply a&s;&s;ertions of the reali|ty of his mi&s;&s;ion, his not boa&s;ting of his dignity, his not &s;tudiou&s;ly di&s;playing the greatne&s;s of the evidence which he had produced, afford in many ways &s;trong pre&s;umptions of the truth of his religi|on. That this is in general his manner, is undeniable. Yet there are &s;everal in&s;tances recorded by the evangeli&s;ts, which bear another face. There are in&s;tances in which he mo&s;t expre&s;s|ly a&s;&s;erts his mi&s;&s;ion; in which he claims very high dignity; in which he purpo&s;ely enumerates the evidences of his religion; or di&s;plays the &s;trength of &s;ome particular evidence of it; in
<PB N="264" REF="304">
which he pronounces men inexcu&s;able for not being convinced of it, and threatens them with perdition on ac|count of their unbelief. But when the&s;e in&s;tances are examined, it appears that they all, without exception, were oc|ca&s;ioned, at lea&s;t by a very violent ge|neral oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t, and for the mo&s;t part too by particular objections again&s;t him. This gives a full and &s;a|tisfactory account of them. In this &s;i|tuation they are wholly unexception|able; no ju&s;t pre&s;umption again&s;t the go&s;pel can ari&s;e from them. Nay, in this &s;ituation, to explain, to urge, and to vindicate the proofs of his mi&s;&s;ion, had as great propriety as the &s;impler method of barely exhibiting them, had in the circum&s;tances in which he adhe|red to it: it was even expre&s;&s;ive of the very &s;ame characters; it gives new a&s;|&s;urance of the reality of his mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="305">
By doing no more at fir&s;t, but pre|&s;enting the evidences of his mi&s;&s;ion, he &s;howed, in a &s;triking manner, his &s;en&s;e of the truth of his claim, and of the au|thenticity of his credentials. But did that &s;en&s;e require, that he &s;hould not enforce the&s;e evidences, when men ac|tually re&s;i&s;ted them, and called their &s;olidity in que&s;tion? On the contrary, it required that he &s;hould. This was e|ven ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for &s;howing that he was &s;incere in claiming a divine mi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ecure of his title to it. If he had neglected it, it would have na|turally been con&s;trued into an acknow|ledgment that his mi&s;&s;ion was fal&s;e, and that the evidences of it, which he pretended to give, were indefen&s;ible; it would have undeniably implied the want of ju&s;t concern for the &s;ucce&s;s of his undertaking, and an indifference un&s;uitable to its importance, and re|pugnant to the character of a divine

Af|ter all the evidence which Chri&s;t had exhibited, his mi&s;&s;ion was called in que&s;tion; not to affirm it, would have been to renounce it. He him&s;elf thought &s;o. On one occa&s;ion, the Jews found fault with him for a&s;&s;erting his real character; they affirmed it not only to be vain-glorious, but al&s;o to be an indication of impo&s;ture: in his an&s;wer, he intimates that not to have born te|&s;timony to him&s;elf, in the circum&s;tances in which he bare it, would have im|plied a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that he came not with the authority of God, nor had a title to the dignity which he a&s;&s;umed, that he knew not whence he came, and whither he went: <HI>tho' I bear record of my|&s;elf,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John viii. 14.</NOTE>. Can any impartial man con&s;ider, that

he bare record to him&s;elf only in con|&s;equence of oppo&s;ition, and attend to the manner in which he bare it, and not admit the defence? Spontaneous anxiety to fore&s;ee and prevent every po&s;&s;ible difficulty, is a &s;ign of that &s;u|&s;piciou&s;ne&s;s which commonly attends deceit: but a readine&s;s to li&s;ten to ob|jections and to obviate them, when they are actually propo&s;ed, is an indi|cation of a very oppo&s;ite temper.

Je&s;us gave the mo&s;t unque&s;ti|onable evidence of this, and on ac|count of his having given it, his reli|gion de&s;erves the greate&s;t credit.</P>
<P>In being contented at fir&s;t with only pre&s;enting evidence in great abun|dance, he &s;ignally di&s;played that ge|nuine dignity, that true greatne&s;s of &s;oul, which de&s;pi&s;es parade and o&s;ten|tation.
<PB N="268" REF="308">
But it was in no way incon|&s;i&s;tent with the perfection of this tem|per, to illu&s;trate that evidence when it had been mi&s;under&s;tood, and to incul|cate it by rea&s;oning, on tho&s;e who, of them&s;elves, perceived not its force. He had exhibited the &s;tronge&s;t eviden|ces of a divine mi&s;&s;ion; yet men had not attended and yielded to them: in this &s;ituation, to remind them that he had exhibited them, to appeal to them as de&s;igned and valid proofs of his mi&s;&s;ion, to point out where their force lay, and to in&s;i&s;t that men ought on account of them to receive him in the character to which he laid claim, was neither meanne&s;s nor o&s;tentation. It was the very oppo&s;ite; to have declined it, would have &s;hown an ill-placed af|fectation of the &s;ame fal&s;e dignity, which might lead an impo&s;tor &s;uperci|liou&s;ly to refu&s;e to give any evidence at fir&s;t. It would have been an expre&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="269" REF="309">
of that pride and haughtine&s;s which mimics maje&s;ty, but really im|plies a great degree of meanne&s;s. Con|de&s;cen&s;ion is an e&s;&s;ential ingredient in natural maje&s;ty; it mixes with all the exertions of it; it is &s;o obviou&s;ly pre|dominant in them, that pride never fails to put on the appearance of it on &s;ome occa&s;ions; but it cannot practi&s;e it &s;o gracefully as to hide the de&s;ign. When Je&s;us met with oppo&s;ition, his readine&s;s to &s;atisfy every &s;cruple, evi|denced the mo&s;t unaffected conde&s;cen|&s;ion; it was a plain expre&s;&s;ion of that benevolence which con&s;titutes the di|vine&s;t character.</P>
<P>Thus, the manner in which Je&s;us inculcated the evidences of his reli|gion, upon tho&s;e who with&s;tood the exhibition of them, weakens none of the pre&s;umptions for Chri&s;tianity, ari|&s;ing from his original manner; the op|po&s;ition which was made to him, ac|counts

for every thing in the go&s;pel, that could be &s;u&s;pected to have this tendency. It even contains new pre|&s;umptions in favour of our religion.

The oppo&s;ition of his contemporaries, gave him an opportunity of di&s;playing this character in various ways; in the mo&s;t contrary &s;ituations, he maintain|ed it uniform and con&s;i&s;tent: this adds to its lu&s;tre; this heightens our a&s;&s;u|rance that it truly belonged to him; this &s;trengthens every indication of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, which can re&s;ult from its author having really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this character.</P>
<P>By the manner in which Chri&s;t ju|&s;tified the evidences of his mi&s;&s;ion, and
<PB N="271" REF="311">
inculcated them on tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed him, no le&s;s than by the manner in which he originally pre&s;ented them, he is a perfect contra&s;t to impo&s;tors. Ma|homet runs &s;pontaneou&s;ly into vaunt|ing; he abounds in it, when no natu|ral occa&s;ion is given for the lea&s;t ap|proach to it; he &s;eeks out occa&s;ions for it: it proves it&s;elf to be the genuine offspring of pre&s;umption, ambition, or &s;ome other principle equally unhallow|ed. Without giving any evidence, he is continually talking in the mo&s;t mag|nificent terms of the certainty of his mi&s;&s;ion. When he is charged with ha|ving produced no evidence, he neither produces any, nor proves that he had already produced what was &s;ufficient; &s;ometimes he denies that it was nece&s;|&s;ary to produce any, &s;ometimes he ex|aggerates the few &s;hadows of evidence, which he had luckily found means of giving, and always he multiplies a&s;&s;er|tions
<PB N="272" REF="312">
of his mi&s;&s;ion, and boldly de|nounces judgment again&s;t all who a&s;k a proof of it. When objections were rai&s;ed, which would have required a particular confutation, if he had had it in his power, he deigns not to enter on it; he &s;atisfies him&s;elf with the re|petition of his confident a&s;&s;ertions, his arrogant boa&s;ts, and his pre&s;umptuous comminations. It is not by argument that he enforces or ju&s;tifies his claim; that would have required evidence as a foundation on which it might have been reared: but it is by declamation; this, being de&s;titute of a foundation, is indeed wholly un&s;ub&s;tantial, but it tends to conceal the want of evidence, and upon the incon&s;iderate it counter|feits the effects of evidence; of all that he had in his power, it was the method be&s;t &s;uited to his purpo&s;e. Je&s;us was of a very different &s;pirit. He never u&s;es expre&s;&s;ions which can be even mi&s;|con&s;trued
<PB N="273" REF="313">
into boa&s;ting, except when he is con&s;trained to it by the mo&s;t na|tural and pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ions. Even then, his a&s;&s;ertions of his mi&s;&s;ion and his real character, cannot be ju&s;tly termed o&s;tentatious; whatever he <HI>claims,</HI> he likewi&s;e <HI>proves</HI> to belong to him: he claims it only in con&s;equence of proof; it is always to evidence undeniably produced, that he appeals; and on it he re&s;ts his cau&s;e; <HI>which of you,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>convinceth me of &s;in</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John viii. 46.</NOTE>? <HI>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. x. 37.</NOTE><HI>: If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had &s;in</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. xv. 24.</NOTE>. He never exaggerates the evidences which he had given; he inculcates the &s;uffi|ciency of them much &s;eldomer than he pre&s;ents evidence without being at any pains to &s;et it off. Yet he never de|clines an&s;wering &s;uch objections as re|quire an an&s;wer: he does not re&s;t &s;a|tisfied
<PB N="274" REF="314">
with affirmations that they are frivolous; he actually removes them by ju&s;t and &s;triking arguments from e|vidence which he had before exhibited; he generally too exhibits further evi|dence; and, when he has done both, he leaves men to feel it, he is not &s;olli|citous to affirm that he has. The evi|dences which Chri&s;t produced were &s;trong, they were &s;uitable to the &s;enti|ments of tho&s;e to whom they were pro|po&s;ed, they were &s;imilar to tho&s;e evi|dences on which they gave credit to their own religion, but far &s;uperior in degree: the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;howed, that their re&s;i&s;ting them proceeded from vicious temper, or prejudice wil|fully indulged; the ab&s;olute futility of their exceptions confirmed it. Was it improper, to warn them of the danger to which this expo&s;ed them? The warning was given in &s;evere threaten|ings: but it could not be fairly given
<PB N="275" REF="315">
in another way; and therefore in this &s;i|tuation, &s;evere threatenings had entire propriety. Are the&s;e &s;imilar to the denunciations of impo&s;tors? In no o|ther particular doth it &s;eem that Chri&s;t re&s;embles them &s;o much as in his threat|enings: but even in the&s;e, it only <HI>&s;eems</HI>; there is a wide and e&s;&s;ential difference. Mahomet threatens men, if they will not believe without any evidence, he employs this engine to terrify men from a&s;king a proof of his mi&s;&s;ion; this is mere arrogance and effrontery: Chri&s;t threatens only tho&s;e who ob&s;ti|nately and wickedly re&s;i&s;ted the &s;trong|e&s;t evidence; this was no more than what a real concern for their happi|ne&s;s rendered nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THIS whole argument will acquire &s;till greater force, if we con&s;ider the nature of Chri&s;t's an&s;wers to the objec|tions propo&s;ed to him, and of his rea|&s;onings concerning the truth of his re|ligion.
<PB N="276" REF="316">
His arguments were always &s;uitable to the divinity of his character. They were not calculated for merely confounding and &s;ilencing men; they had a direct tendency to remove their mi&s;takes; they both enlightened and &s;atisfied the under&s;tanding. They are not in any degree intended to make a &s;how of ingenuity; they always lead to conviction by the &s;horte&s;t road, with|out &s;o much as the appearance of any other view. The argument is never deduced from ab&s;tru&s;e or di&s;tant prin|ciples, it is never carried on by &s;ubtile and intricate rea&s;oning: it is always conci&s;e, clear, and cogent; it is dedu|ced from obvious principles, and &s;uch as will be mo&s;t readily admitted; it is, in all its parts, level to common capa|cities, and proper for begetting imme|diate conviction; it is by a happy, but artle&s;s, addre&s;s, &s;et in &s;uch a point of view, that, while it convinces, it both
<PB N="277" REF="317">
engages the attention, and touches the heart. In the rea&s;onings by which the truth of Chri&s;tianity is &s;upported in the New Te&s;tament, there is nothing mean, nothing artificial, nothing in a|ny re&s;pect weak or &s;u&s;picious. They are at once &s;uch as tend naturally to the illu&s;tration of real and &s;trong evi|dence; &s;uch as are be&s;t fitted for over|coming the prejudices of men, and working conviction in them; and &s;uch as are worthy of a divine teacher. But are all the rea&s;onings in the New Te|&s;tament, of this &s;ort? Are there not &s;ome, e&s;pecially in Paul's writings, which appear to be in a con&s;iderable degree &s;ubtile and intricate? I will not affirm, that there are none to which this character may be applied. But a great part of the intricacy of &s;uch rea|&s;onings as &s;eem mo&s;t to de&s;erve the character, is only apparent, ari&s;ing from our ignorance of &s;ome things
<PB N="278" REF="318">
proper for throwing light upon them, from our affixing mere modern ideas to &s;ome of the expre&s;&s;ions employed, or from other cau&s;es which had no in|fluence upon tho&s;e to whom the apo|&s;tles wrote. Be&s;ides, they are compa|ratively very few; and the&s;e few are employed, not in proving the truth of Chri&s;tianity, but for other purpo&s;es: &s;till therefore the de&s;cription which has been given, holds <HI>generally</HI> of the &s;cripture rea&s;onings, and <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> of tho&s;e by which the truth of the go&s;pel is &s;upported. But if, among the many conci&s;e and &s;imple arguments for the truth of Chri&s;tianity, which are con|tained in the New Te&s;tament, one or two intricate and &s;ubtile rea&s;onings &s;hould be found, they would not be &s;ufficient to invalidate what we have &s;aid; they would rather &s;erve to &s;how, that our religion is capable of a defence

<P>THUS the manner which Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles adopted on occa&s;ion of op|po&s;ition and objections, in all the lights in which we can con&s;ider it, not only gives great advantage for the vindica|tion of Chri&s;tianity, but al&s;o carries on and compleats a &s;eparate and col|lateral proof of the truth of this reli|gion; a proof of it ari&s;ing from this, that its evidences were propo&s;ed, tho' differently in different &s;ituations, yet always with entire propriety. In Chri&s;t's manner of &s;upporting his mi&s;|&s;ion, the genuine marks of a divine teacher &s;hone forth, but naturally va|ried ju&s;t as the ca&s;e required.

<HEAD>The perfection of the manner in which the EVIDENCES of
CHRISTIANITY were propo&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>ORIGINALLY Chri&s;t &s;upported his mi&s;&s;ion in the &s;imple&s;t manner, by merely pre&s;enting the evidences of it: oppo&s;ition gave him a natural oc|ca&s;ion of &s;uperadding the argumenta|tive manner. By the union of the&s;e, the proof of Chri&s;tianity was propo&s;ed in a manner altogether entire and perfect. In order to evince this, little more will be nece&s;&s;ary, but to bring into one view the &s;ub&s;tance of what has been already &s;aid. Each of the&s;e manners has &s;ome di&s;advantages: in the go&s;pel, one corrects the inconveniences, and
<PB N="282" REF="322">
&s;upplies the defects, which would have attended the other, if it had been u&s;ed alone. Each of them too has peculiar advantages: the go&s;pel has &s;ecured tho&s;e of the one kind, without forfeit|ing any of the oppo&s;ite. Had Chri&s;t confined him&s;elf to either of the&s;e manners, it might have been pro|ved notwith&s;tanding, that Chri&s;tianity is true. This ari&s;es from the &s;ingular fulne&s;s of its evidence, and is indeed a very &s;triking indication of it: but he u&s;ed both, and he u&s;ed each in its pro|per place; this makes the divinity of his religion more indi&s;putable. The manner in which the evidences of our religion were propo&s;ed, may be con&s;i|dered either in reference to tho&s;e who&s;e conviction was intended, or in relation to the character which the employing of it, &s;hows Je&s;us to have been po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of. In both re&s;pects, it is proper and perfect.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="323">
JESUS began with &s;imply exhibiting the evidence of his mi&s;&s;ion. This was &s;ufficient for convincing the attentive and the unprejudiced, provided the e|vidence was in its nature &s;olid: it was in addre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e who had not yet &s;hown them&s;elves de&s;titute of the&s;e cha|racters, that he contented him&s;elf with this. He &s;aved them the labour of at|tending to exceptions which had no weight with them, and &s;olutions for which they had no need; he led them to faith by the direct road. But all were not of that di&s;po&s;ition; many neglect|ed the evidence which he gave, or cal|led its force in que&s;tion: whenever they did, the evidence was pointed out, and &s;hown to be conclu&s;ive. Objections were formed again&s;t the evidence: im|mediately they were an&s;wered, and that in &s;uch a manner, that men would ne|ver have repeated them, if they had, as was certainly incumbent on them, fir&s;t
<PB N="284" REF="324">
refuted the an&s;wers already made. The exhibition of the evidence of the go|&s;pel, without any illu&s;tration, convin|ced many of its truth; by this, that e|vidence proved it&s;elf to be very &s;trong, and &s;trictly natural. Had it been al|ways illu&s;trated when it was exhibited, there would have been no opportunity given for its &s;howing in this way, how &s;trong it really was; it would have been taken for granted, that its weakne&s;s or ob&s;curity ab&s;olutely required all this il|lu&s;tration, in order to make it to be perceived. But many cau&s;es may hin|der the &s;tronge&s;t evidence from produ|cing belief in individuals; they did hinder the evidence of the go&s;pel from bringing all to whom it was exhibited, to believe: in this ca&s;e, it was &s;hown by ju&s;t rea&s;oning, that the evidence was notwith&s;tanding &s;trong, and that its not prevailing univer&s;ally, was ow|ing only to the indi&s;po&s;ition of men's
<PB N="285" REF="325">
minds. A &s;imple exhibition of it, &s;uc|ceeded in convincing many; here its &s;trength was exerted, and, by the ex|ertion, di&s;played: on occa&s;ion of the in|credulity of others, its &s;trength was ex|amined, and, by the examination, ju&s;ti|fied. If its &s;trength had not been real, it could in neither way have appeared &s;o con&s;picuous. The generality of man|kind are not capable of entering into long trains of argument; they are per|plexed by a &s;eries of rea&s;ons, objections, and an&s;wers; they are rendered inca|pable of determining any thing. In or|der to obtain a rational conviction of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, they need not attempt what they are unequal to; plain evidence is pre&s;ented to them; there is no need of intricate rea&s;oning to enable them to perceive it: they are de&s;ired only to attend to it; if they do, they will &s;u&s;tain no lo&s;s by not enter|ing into the labyrinths of controver&s;y;
<PB N="286" REF="326">
if they be but hone&s;t, it will by its own power force their a&s;&s;ent. But &s;ome are prone to argumentation, ready to &s;tart difficulties, fond of canva&s;&s;ing them, and di&s;po&s;ed to &s;u&s;pend their a&s;&s;ent, till they be cleared. Chri&s;t often met with &s;uch per&s;ons; he li&s;tened to eve|ry difficulty which they propo&s;ed, he gave a patient hearing even to the mere&s;t cavils; he offered &s;olutions of them all; the &s;olution had always &s;oli|dity enough to &s;ilence the acute&s;t, and to convince the impartial that all ought to have been &s;atisfied: at the &s;ame time, the argument exceeded not the com|prehen&s;ion of the mo&s;t ordinary man; it never failed to have a &s;urprizing, and almo&s;t &s;ingular degree of conci&s;e|ne&s;s and per&s;picuity. If Chri&s;t had found no opportunity for this, his revelation would have given Chri&s;tians no direct a&s;&s;i&s;tance in an&s;wering objections which might have been afterwards rai&s;ed a|gain&s;t
<PB N="287" REF="327">
it. The defect would not have been of very fatal con&s;equence: if the evidence was real, it is enough that it was addre&s;&s;ed to rea&s;onable creatures; they had already, by the con&s;titution of their nature, faculties proper for di|&s;tingui&s;hing real evidence from &s;puri|ous, and for detecting the fallacy of &s;uch cavils as prejudice or &s;ceptici&s;m may oppo&s;e to the former. But even &s;o immaterial a defect adheres not to the Chri&s;tian revelation. Je&s;us had op|portunities, of preventing objections which might have had a &s;pecious ap|pearance, if room had been left for them; of an&s;wering others, and, in an&s;wering them, of producing princi|ples &s;o exten&s;ively applicable, that we have not only examples which we may imitate, but al&s;o materials which we may &s;ucce&s;sfully employ, in the defence of our religion. There are very diffe|rent characters among men; but Chri&s;t
<PB N="288" REF="328">
proved his mi&s;&s;ion in a way &s;uited to them all: the manner in which he o|riginally proved it, is the fitte&s;t po&s;&s;ible for the conviction of the attentive, the candid, and men of ordinary capacity; but he propo&s;ed it likewi&s;e in a way fit to &s;atisfy the &s;peculative, the inqui|&s;itive, the captious, and the prejudiced. His manner is nicely adapted to uni|ver&s;al conviction; the objections mu&s;t be very &s;trong, which can &s;how that there was no real evidence given, where a manner &s;o &s;uitable to very bright evidence was pre&s;erved, and pur&s;ued through all its natural varia|tions; there is &s;carce a po&s;&s;ibility that there &s;hould be &s;uch objections. That the evidences of the go&s;pel were given in a way &s;o fit, in all re&s;pects, for pro|ducing faith, is a very &s;trong pre&s;ump|tion, that they are &s;ufficient, that Chri|&s;tianity is true, and that infidelity is
<PB N="289" REF="329">
not excu&s;eable in per&s;ons of any turn of under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>IT is not the only excellence of the manner in which Chri&s;t proved his mi&s;|&s;ion, that it is equally adapted to the conviction of the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite &s;orts of men: it is moreover a natural expre&s;|&s;ion of that character which he a&s;&s;umed. He &s;pontaneou&s;ly and readily exhibi|ted evidence in the greate&s;t abundance. To have done otherwi&s;e, would have been a &s;trong pre&s;umption that he could produce none; it would have left his claim without any real foun|dation; it would have betrayed, either a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of impo&s;ture, or &s;uch an indifference to &s;ucce&s;s, as is not con&s;i&s;t|ent with a real mi&s;&s;ion for any import|ant purpo&s;e. By readily giving evi|dence, he &s;hows, that he was con&s;cious of the truth of his mi&s;&s;ion, and of his power to &s;upport it; and that he de&s;i|red
<PB N="290" REF="330">
to &s;upport it only by the mo&s;t le|gitimate means, that he &s;ought to bring men to believe, only by a copious and undi&s;gui&s;ed addre&s;s to the natural prin|ciples of belief; he &s;hows, that, with the conde&s;cen&s;ion e&s;&s;ential to true great|ne&s;s, he was willing to do every thing really nece&s;&s;ary for promoting the end of his coming. He never of his own accord laboured to &s;et off the evidence which he had given. This &s;howed his &s;en&s;e of the &s;trength of that evidence; it &s;howed that he under&s;tood well in what way the bulk of mankind ought to be addre&s;&s;ed; it &s;howed that he was free from the artifice by which per&s;ons of a &s;ubtilizing and di&s;putatious turn, often confound plain men, and hide the want of evidence from others; it &s;howed that he was remote both from the meanne&s;s of o&s;tentation, and from the &s;u&s;piciou&s;ne&s;s attendant upon fal&s;e|hood and cunning. But whenever the
<PB N="291" REF="331">
evidence of his mi&s;&s;ion was called in que&s;tion, he readily defended it, illu|&s;trated it, and frequently too made an addition to it. This was a new and well-placed expre&s;&s;ion of con&s;cious &s;in|cerity: it was in this &s;ituation that rea|&s;oning and di&s;puting became con&s;i&s;tent with dignity of character; here indeed, true dignity required it; and in the manner of all his rea&s;onings, dignity was uniformly pre&s;erved. Impo&s;tors act a part in all re&s;pects the rever&s;e of this. In exhibiting evidence, they are very &s;paring; by this alone they forfeit all right to credit, and betray their fal&s;ehood; to require that we &s;hould believe, and yet not to give evidence, is to mock us, and in&s;ult our under|&s;tandings. They attempt to ju&s;tify their &s;paringne&s;s, by pretending that they di&s;dain to gratify the perver&s;e and incredulous: this is a mere affec|tation of dignity intended to conceal
<PB N="292" REF="332">
their inability to &s;atisfy a rational en|quirer; it can proceed from no better &s;ource, for dignity is &s;o ill put on, that haughtine&s;s is mi&s;taken for it. In a&s;|&s;erting that they ought to be believed, in magnifying any appearances of evi|dence which they think they have gi|ven, they are liberal, they are immode|rate. It is in de&s;pi&s;ing this, that true dignity would have expre&s;&s;ed it&s;elf: this is the greate&s;t meanne&s;s; it is the &s;illie&s;t vanity, it is the mo&s;t di&s;ingenu|ous artifice. They &s;upport their cau&s;e, not by rea&s;oning, but by declamation; they employ it mo&s;t when they are not among tho&s;e who oppo&s;e them: when they are pre&s;&s;ed with objections, they &s;ometimes divert men's attention from the real que&s;tion as well as they can, and &s;ometimes their haughtine&s;s re|turns, and a&s;&s;uming the name of maje|&s;ty becoming a divine me&s;&s;enger, for|bids them to conde&s;cend to an&s;wer.

Every part of his manner gives &s;ome evidence of the divinity of his mi&s;&s;ion, as every point of the &s;un e|mits a ray of light: when we take in his whole manner at one view, the in|dications of divinity re&s;ulting from it, act on the under&s;tanding with an irre|&s;i&s;tible force, like rays collected into a focus, again&s;t the heat of which no combu&s;tible materials can be proof.</P>
<P>WE may add to all that has been &s;aid, that Chri&s;t's manner, not only is the fitte&s;t for the conviction of men, and the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of the character of a divine teacher, but al&s;o &s;hows the greate&s;t &s;trength of under&s;tanding, and the highe&s;t powers of rea&s;on. Intellec|tual vigour appears in the original ex|hibition of the evidences of the go&s;pel;
<PB N="294" REF="334">
for only &s;olid evidence is exhibited. A per&s;on of weak under&s;tanding betrays his weakne&s;s, not only when he at|tempts to pur&s;ue an argument through all its &s;teps, but al&s;o by never failing to build on &s;ome un&s;ub&s;tantial principle, or to employ a wrong kind, or an im|perfect degree of evidence. By pre&s;ent|ing only &s;uch evidence as is &s;olid, by appealing only to principles from which conclu&s;ive arguments are deducible, &s;trength of under&s;tanding is di&s;played, as really as by pur&s;uing the argument minutely through the mo&s;t regular train of rea&s;oning. Indeed not to be able to urge an argument clo&s;ely and particularly, when this is proper, would &s;how an imperfection of under&s;tand|ing. But it is likewi&s;e an imperfection, not to be able to render an argument convincing, by placing it at once in a &s;triking point of view, without minute|ly urging it. In the few in&s;tances in
<PB N="295" REF="335">
which it was proper or nece&s;&s;ary for Chri&s;t to enter into rea&s;onings of any length, he gives &s;ufficient evidence that he laboured not under the former im|perfection: all his rea&s;onings are proofs that he was free from the latter, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the oppo&s;ite talent in great perfection; none of them are intricate, very few are particular or minute, they are generally immediate deductions from ju&s;t principles; yet all of them are &s;atisfying. This manner is acknow|ledged to be a mark of &s;uperior pene|tration. There are many of Newton's demon&s;trations, a &s;ingle &s;tep of which it would require &s;everal propo&s;itions to evince minutely: this never was &s;up|po&s;ed to imply any intellectual defect; it &s;hows plainly an uncommon reach of thought. In pro&s;ecuting an argu|ment particularly, imagination receives many a&s;&s;i&s;tances; attention to the in|termediate ideas, both facilitates the
<PB N="296" REF="336">
di&s;covery of ju&s;t principles, and leads to a gradual di&s;cernment of the influ|ence which they have upon the conclu|&s;ion. A weak under&s;tanding needs the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances. It is vigour of mind that enables a man to conceive and expre&s;s the whole force of the argu|ment, without having recour&s;e to them. In every argument for the truth of Chri&s;tianity, urged either by Je&s;us or by his apo&s;tles, that vigour of mind ap|pears remarkably. It may be added, that they have &s;atisfied them&s;elves with exhibiting evidence, whenever no more was nece&s;&s;ary, and have always enfor|ced it when that was proper; and all this, throughout an addre&s;s to man|kind continued for years. This is a pitch of excellence which per&s;ons or|dinarily attain, only when great natu|ral penetration is united with the hap|pie&s;t opportunities of intellectual im|provement. But when we con&s;ider
<PB N="297" REF="337">
how few opportunities either Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles had of attaining it by na|tural means, their having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it in &s;o eminent a degree, and exerted it with &s;o uniform propriety, in very dif|ferent, and even contrary &s;ituations, can &s;carce fail to lead us to conclude, that they owed it to &s;upernatural cau|&s;es, and that they were, as they affirm|ed them&s;elves to be, per&s;ons commi&s;|&s;ioned and in&s;pired by God. In this way, a new pre&s;umption of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, ari&s;es from the manner in which its evidences were propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>THUS, in every light in which this manner can be con&s;idered, it is ab&s;o|lutely faultle&s;s: there is nothing want|ing, nothing &s;uperfluous, nothing mi&s;|placed. It is throughout an applica|tion of evidence, the complete&s;t, the be&s;t adapted to the human under&s;tand|ing, and the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of a di|vine
<PB N="298" REF="338">
original, that can be even ima|gined. The pre&s;umptions of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, which ari&s;e from this topic, are very &s;trong; they imply ve|ry plainly that the evidence which was thus propo&s;ed, mu&s;t have been natural and &s;ound: they have therefore the directe&s;t tendency to excite all who have any candour, to the diligent ex|amination of it; and the view of them mu&s;t add great &s;trength to the faith of tho&s;e who already believe the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t fini&s;hed works of art, there are &s;ome defects; even in the works of nature, many particulars ap|pear exceptionable to a ha&s;ty and &s;u|perficial ob&s;erver. Divine contrivance is &s;o deep, and &s;o far &s;urpa&s;&s;es the &s;kill of men, that it is rea&s;onable to expect in every thing which comes from God, &s;ome circum&s;tances unaccountable and &s;eemingly exceptionable. When fur|ther acquaintance teacheth us, that
<PB N="299" REF="339">
what we imagined a defect, is really an excellence, that what we reckoned a blemi&s;h, is a beauty, that what we thought pernicious, is highly u&s;eful; the di&s;covery fills us with the mo&s;t a|greeable &s;urpri&s;e, &s;trikes us with the livelie&s;t admiration of the divine wi&s;|dom, and works the firme&s;t conviction that God is indeed the author of the work. Tho&s;e circum&s;tances in the manner of the fir&s;t publication of Chri|&s;tianity, which proclaim its truth, are, in &s;ome in&s;tances, &s;uch as we would be apt to find fault with, on a &s;uperficial view: the perception of their real force, will have the greater effect on this very account; the &s;urpri&s;e which it excites, mixing with our a&s;&s;ent, will render it the firmer and the more vigorous.</P>
<P>There is no &s;ubject on which diffi|culties may not be rai&s;ed, in &s;ome of the lights in which it is po&s;&s;ible to place it. Difficulties have been rai&s;ed with re|&s;pect
<PB N="300" REF="340">
to the truth of the go&s;pel. There are &s;ome men who have a natural pro|pen&s;ity to fix their attention upon dif|ficulties; and there are moments in which mo&s;t men are apt to conceive difficulties &s;trongly, to be much affect|ed with them, and inclined on account of them to doubt of what is &s;upported by the directe&s;t proof. It is &s;ufficient for recovering men from this &s;ituation, to reflect on the weakne&s;s of human under&s;tanding, which prevents our at|taining a perfect comprehen&s;ion of a|ny &s;ubject, and puts it out of our power to give a po&s;itive account of e|very difficulty. To perceive, that tho&s;e difficulties which occur in the defence of Chri&s;tianity, &s;uppo&s;ing them real, do not infer its fal&s;ity; or, that the difficulties which &s;eem to pre&s;s it, are not real, but capable of a direct &s;olution; contributes &s;till more to ba|ni&s;h uncertainty concerning its divini|ty.
<PB N="301" REF="341">
But nothing has a more powerful tendency to compo&s;e the mind, to place it in complete &s;erenity and a&s;&s;u|rance, to give entire peace in believing, than to ob&s;erve, how many circum&s;tan|ces of the mo&s;t various kinds, concur in proclaiming the truth of the go&s;pel. When a per&s;on di&s;cerns, that its prin|cipal evidences, natural and &s;trong in them&s;elves, are &s;upported and confirm|ed by collateral arguments, innume|rable, and derived from very di&s;&s;imilar &s;ources, he cannot entertain any &s;u&s;|picion that it is not true and divine; he cannot reckon it po&s;&s;ible that, if it were fal&s;e, there could have been a concurrence of &s;o many indications of truth. None of the&s;e arguments con|tributes more largely to the production of this effect, than that which ari&s;es from the manner in which the eviden|ces of Chri&s;tianity were propo&s;ed. It adds greatly to the &s;plendor of that
<PB N="302" REF="342">
blaze of evidence which overpowers the &s;oul when one conceives all the proofs of the go&s;pel together, which &s;uffers him not to doubt that it is from God, which makes all &s;mall difficulties and trivial objections to be forgotten as unworthy of regard; ju&s;t as bright &s;un&s;hine cau&s;es tho&s;e clouds to di&s;ap|pear, which before were clearly vi&s;i|ble, and covers the whole face of the heavens with uniform and unbroken radiance.</P>

<P>IT is by &s;uch friction as &s;eems at fir&s;t &s;ight likely to break it, that the dia|mond is poli&s;hed and receives its lu&s;tre. In like manner, it is by being fretted, as it were, with every difficulty and objection, that truth is made to &s;how the full brightne&s;s of its evidence. The trial di&s;tingui&s;hes the true gem from the &s;uppo&s;ed one, which in the
<PB N="306" REF="345">
lump promi&s;ed, perhaps, as fair as it: And plau&s;ible fal&s;ehoods are often as well received as real truths, till both have been &s;ubjected to an exact and &s;e|vere examination; but the oppo&s;ition of argument overturns the former, and renders the certainty of the latter more undeniable.</P>
<P>NO &s;pecies of truth has been &s;ubject|ed to a &s;tricter &s;crutiny, or tried by ruder oppo&s;ition, than the evidences of our holy religion. As &s;oon as this heavenly gem was pre&s;ented to the world, both Jews and Heathens fell upon it with &s;o great violence, that, if it had had the &s;malle&s;t flaw, it mu&s;t have been &s;hattered into pieces. It has been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the world for many centuries; and numberle&s;s attempts have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively made, to prove that it is a worthle&s;s counter|feit: but all the&s;e attempts have only
<PB N="307" REF="346">
contributed to evince with &s;tronger evidence, that it is genuine.</P>
<P>THAT per&s;ecution promoted, in&s;tead of ob&s;tructing, the progre&s;s of Chri&s;ti|anity, has been very commonly remark|ed. Sometimes too, it has been a&s;&s;ert|ed in general, that the oppo&s;ition of unbelievers in the way of argument, has confirmed the divinity of the Chri|&s;tian religion, and thrown new light upon its evidences. It is worth while to undertake a profe&s;&s;ed examination of this a&s;&s;ertion. If it &s;hall appear to be true, it will afford a &s;trong pre&s;ump|tion of the truth of Chri&s;tianity: it will &s;how, that Chri&s;tianity gains, not only by being viewed in various lights, but al&s;o by being narrowly in&s;pected in every light. That the a&s;&s;ertion is true, will be be&s;t proved by inquiring, in what particular ways the oppo&s;ition of infidels has contributed to the illu|&s;tration

<P>Of the advantages which Chri&s;tiani|ty has derived from oppo&s;ition, &s;ome are peculiarly owing to the oppo&s;ition of infidels in early ages; others ari&s;e from oppo&s;ition in general. We &s;hall begin with the con&s;ideration of the former.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The advantages which CHRISTIANITY has derived from the
oppo&s;ition of early INFIDELS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the preceeding di&s;&s;ertation, we have fully explained the manner in which the evidences of the go&s;pel were at fir&s;t propo&s;ed, and pointed out the excellence of that manner. But this excellence could not po&s;&s;ibly have been attained, if Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles had not met with oppo&s;ition. All the indications of truth, which it implies, may therefore be ju&s;tly a&s;cri|bed, in a great mea&s;ure, to the oppo|&s;ition of Infidels. If none had rai&s;ed objections again&s;t the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us, he and his apo&s;tles mu&s;t have
<PB N="310" REF="349">
either confined them&s;elves to their ori|ginal manner of &s;imply exhibiting evi|dence, or they mu&s;t have <HI>&s;pontaneou&s;ly</HI> illu&s;trated and vindicated the evidence. If they had cho&s;en the former, their manner would have indeed contained &s;everal pre&s;umptions of the truth of Chri&s;tianity; but it would have been in &s;ome re&s;pects lame and imperfect, and all the advantages ari&s;ing from their <HI>rea&s;onings,</HI> would have been lo&s;t. If they had preferred the latter, this would have de&s;troyed all tho&s;e proofs of their mi&s;&s;ion, which re&s;ult from the &s;implicity of their original manner. It would have likewi&s;e rendered their rea|&s;onings of le&s;s weight than they now are. Oppo&s;ition gives the mo&s;t natu|ral occa&s;ion of pointing out the force of the evidence produced, and it gives almo&s;t the only natural occa&s;ion of an|&s;wering the objections to which that evidence is liable. It enables a per&s;on
<PB N="311" REF="350">
to introduce illu&s;trations and defences without any appearance of de&s;ign or artifice. It put it in the power of our Saviour to &s;upport and vindicate his claim by argument, as often as any good purpo&s;e required; and, by giving as many opportunities for this as were nece&s;&s;ary, it left him at liberty, in <HI>all</HI> his ordinary addre&s;&s;es to men, to pur|&s;ue that original manner which is &s;o full of divinity. It made way for a delicate union of oppo&s;ite manners in oppo&s;ite &s;ituations, which be&s;tows on his whole manner a degree of perfec|tion, and con&s;equently be&s;tows on his religion a brightne&s;s of evidence, un|attainable by any other means. Thus the a&s;&s;aults of ancient infidels contri|buted greatly to the confirmation of Chri&s;tianity, merely by the influence which they had on the manner of its author in propo&s;ing the proofs of it. But this, tho' very con&s;iderable, is not
<PB N="312" REF="351">
the only advantage re&s;ulting from them. This advantage is peculiar to the oppo&s;ition of the contemporaries of Je&s;us: but the &s;ame prejudices and vices which produced that oppo&s;ition, moved &s;ucceeding unbelievers in the early ages, to contrive new objections again&s;t the go&s;pel, or to repeat the former ones. The&s;e too have been the occa&s;ions of throwing new light upon the evidences of our religion, and of rendering their &s;trength more con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>MODERN Infidels have often endea|voured to gain advantage to their cau&s;e from the unbelief of &s;o many in ancient times. <Q REND="inline">"The contemporaries of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, &s;ay they, and tho&s;e who lived in the next age, had great advantages for examination, and could not fail to perceive the evi|dence of the Chri&s;tian religion, &s;o
<PB N="313" REF="352">
far as it was real: if they neverthe|le&s;s believed not, no wonder that unbelievers &s;hould be multiplied in later ages, when the di&s;tance of time mu&s;t have burdened the evidence with many difficulties additional to tho&s;e which had force enough to pro|duce infidelity at fir&s;t. Nay, the infidelity of multitudes in the earli|e&s;t ages, is it&s;elf a &s;trong rea&s;on for our rejecting the go&s;pel; for if its e|vidence had been &s;o great as is pre|tended, they who had that evidence &s;et before them in its full force, could not have been &s;o unrea&s;onable as to per&s;i&s;t in infidelity. If they had not found good cau&s;e for unbelief, if there had not been &s;ome flaw in the grounds of Chri&s;tianity, which their favourable &s;ituation gave them the means of detecting, they mu&s;t have all become Chri&s;tians."</Q> If this rea&s;oning be &s;pecious, it is no
<PB N="314" REF="353">
more. It can have no degree of real force, except it be &s;uppo&s;ed that all in tho&s;e ages, who re&s;i&s;ted the go&s;pel, were influenced purely by the love of truth. But this cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed. Every per&s;on knows, that oppo&s;ition to a new doctrine ari&s;es frequently from very different, and even oppo&s;ite cau|&s;es. Attachment to opinions which have been in&s;tilled by education, and confirmed by habit, often produces pre|judice &s;o inveterate as to hinder men from &s;o much as examining opinions contradictory to them, or be&s;towing the lea&s;t attention on any thing that is urged in &s;upport of the&s;e opinions. Ac|tuated by it, men ob&s;tinately reject un|doubted truths, and can perceive no force at all in the &s;tronge&s;t arguments. This is notorious from univer&s;al expe|rience: what then can be more unrea|&s;onable than to take it for granted, that the unbelief of early infidels proceeded
<PB N="315" REF="354">
only from their di&s;covering a real fal|lacy in the evidences of the go&s;pel? But we need not re&s;t the matter on a gene|ral principle: their oppo&s;ition it&s;elf is &s;uch as &s;hows that it did actually pro|ceed from other cau&s;es, and that it can|not po&s;&s;ibly afford the &s;lendere&s;t pre|&s;umption again&s;t the truth of Chri&s;tia|nity.</P>
<P>We are informed of many of the oc|ca&s;ions on which both Jews and Gen|tiles took exception; and the&s;e &s;how that they were under the power of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t prejudices. How often, for in|&s;tance, did the Jews oppo&s;e Je&s;us upon no other pretence but this, that it was the Sabbath-day when he healed the di&s;ea&s;es of men? This will be acknow|ledged to be the mo&s;t abject &s;uper&s;ti|tion. At Thyatira, <HI>the multitude ro&s;e up together again&s;t Paul and Silas, and the ma|gi&s;trates</HI> interpo&s;ed their authority to &s;i|lence them: from what principle did
<PB N="316" REF="355">
this general oppo&s;ition ari&s;e? From &s;trong affection to the idolatry and &s;u|per&s;tition of Pagani&s;m: the accu&s;ation which occa&s;ioned it, was, <HI>The&s;e men teach cu&s;toms which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to ob&s;erve, being Romans</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvi. 19,&mdash;22.</NOTE>. At Ephe&s;us a violent uproar was rai&s;ed again&s;t Paul: for what rea&s;on? <HI>He hath per&s;uaded much people, that they be no gods, which are made with hands, &s;o that there is danger that the temple of the great godde&s;s Diana &s;hould be de&s;pi&s;ed, and her magnifi|cence &s;hould be de&s;troyed, whom all A&s;ia and the world wor&s;hippeth</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. xix. 26, 27.</NOTE>. With modern In|fidels, &s;uper&s;tition is the object of the mo&s;t inveterate hatred; in ca&s;es where it is neither &s;o gro&s;s nor &s;o indi&s;putable as in the&s;e, they affirm that it nece&s;&s;a|rily blindeth rea&s;on. Can they then take ancient Infidels for their models? Can they pretend, that the judgment of men &s;o deeply immer&s;ed in &s;uper|&s;tition, affords the &s;lendere&s;t pre&s;ump|tion
<PB N="317" REF="356">
in favour of the cau&s;e which they e&s;pou&s;ed?</P>
<P>Further, from the <HI>nature</HI> of the objec|tions which ancient unbelievers urged, it appears, what were the very rea&s;ons for which they rejected Chri&s;tianity. If you hold their oppo&s;ition to be of any authority, you mu&s;t maintain, that the declared rea&s;ons of it are &s;olid and &s;ufficient. If you own that their objections were in&s;ufficient, you mu&s;t likewi&s;e own that they acted an unrea|&s;onable part in allowing the&s;e objec|tions to prevent their becoming Chri|&s;tians; for tho' the conclu&s;ion &s;hould happen to be true, yet if it be embra|ced on fal&s;e or ab&s;urd principles, this &s;hows as great an intellectual weakne&s;s, as would appear in adopting a fal&s;e conclu&s;ion: and if you allow that their infidelity was unrea&s;onable, you can|not con&s;i&s;tently draw any conclu&s;ion from it, again&s;t the go&s;pel. Take the
<PB N="318" REF="357">
objections therefore which they mo|ved; weigh them fairly; can you &s;ay that they alone could ju&s;tify the rejec|tion of the Chri&s;tian religion? A mo|dern Infidel can &s;carce affirm it; for they proceed on principles directly re|pugnant to his mo&s;t favourite maxims. Far from giving countenance, for in|&s;tance, to the objections of the Dei&s;t a|gain&s;t revelation in general, they are founded on the contrary &s;uppo&s;ition. All ancient Infidels allowed, both that a revelation is po&s;&s;ible, and that revela|tions had been often given; they either believed the Mo&s;aic revelation on evi|dences which had been exhibited thou|&s;ands of years before, and tran&s;mitted through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, or they gave credit to the fables, the ora|cles, and the pre&s;ages of Pagani&s;m; and it was on principles ari&s;ing from this belief, that they rea&s;oned again&s;t Chri&s;tianity. Will any Dei&s;t adopt
<PB N="319" REF="358">
their rea&s;onings, or affirm that the &s;malle&s;t deference is due to the judg|ment which, on the&s;e principles, they were plea&s;ed to form? Can it be ho|ne&s;tly affirmed, that to receive either Pagani&s;m or Judai&s;m, and yet reject Chri&s;tianity, is not partial, perver&s;e, and incon&s;i&s;tent?&mdash;The Jewi&s;h &s;crip|tures contained many prophetical de|&s;criptions of the Me&s;&s;iah; yet the Jews would not acknowledge Je&s;us to be the Me&s;&s;iah. If modern Infidels will avail them&s;elves of their authority, it mu&s;t be by maintaining that the Jews could not but under&s;tand their own &s;criptures be&s;t, and by concluding that they per|ceived that the prophecies were not fulfilled in Je&s;us. A very little atten|tion to the grounds of their oppo&s;ition will make it evident that there is no room for &s;uppo&s;ing this. They appli|ed the very &s;ame predictions to the Me&s;|&s;iah, which Chri&s;tians under&s;tand of
<PB N="320" REF="359">
him; the proofs that they did &s;o, are numerous and irrefragable: they un|der&s;tood the fifty-third chapter of I&s;aiah, for in&s;tance, to refer to the Me&s;&s;iah; one of their objections recorded in the go&s;pel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John vii. 27.</NOTE>, is mo&s;t probably founded on a part of that chapter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah liii. 8.</NOTE>: yet they reck|oned it incredible, that the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould &s;uffer and die before he entered into his kingdom. It is in a pa&s;&s;age of Daniel that the Redeemer of the world is foretold under the name, MESSIAH, which the Jews u&s;ed very frequently; there it is expre&s;sly &s;aid, that he <HI>&s;hall be cut off</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Daniel ix. 26.</NOTE>: yet they expected not that he &s;hould be put to death. To believe the&s;e to be in&s;pired predictions of the Me&s;&s;iah, and yet to reckon a mean con|dition, &s;ufferings, and death, incon|&s;i&s;tent with the character of the Me&s;|&s;iah, is a degree of ab&s;urdity hardly credible. It makes it plain that they were warped by prejudices, which ren|dered
<PB N="321" REF="360">
them totally blind to the obvi|ous meaning of their own prophecies. Their judgment is &s;o gro&s;sly perver&s;e, that it can po&s;&s;e&s;s no authority, nor merit the lea&s;t regard.&mdash;The &s;entiments of ancient Infidels concerning the Chri|&s;tian miracles, can &s;erve as little to bring them into di&s;credit, or to le&s;&s;en their force, at lea&s;t in the opinion of modern Dei&s;ts. Can we conclude, that, if &s;o many miracles had been wrought in confirmation of Chri&s;tianity as are &s;aid to have been wrought, none of tho&s;e who &s;aw them, could have re&s;i&s;t|ed their force? Can it be in&s;inuated, that the oppo&s;ition of early Infidels gives any rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that the Chri&s;tian miracles were fictions?

You mu&s;t either allow, therefore, that it was perfectly rea&s;onable to believe, that all the miracles recorded in the go&s;pel, were really wrought in the manner there de&s;cribed, and yet that the go&s;pel is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e; or you mu&s;t grant, that the judgment of the&s;e men was altogether wrong and incon|&s;i&s;tent, and con&s;equently unfit for &s;up|porting any conclu&s;ion again&s;t Chri&s;ti|anity.

<P>From the oppo&s;ition of ancient Infi|dels, no pre&s;umption of the fal&s;ehood of Chri&s;tianity can be collected, except &s;o far as the rea&s;ons of their oppo&s;ition are reckoned &s;olid: but the&s;e are &s;uch as no modern Infidel will affirm to be &s;olid; they are palpably weak and in|con&s;i&s;tent. Will this be a&s;cribed to want of abilities in the adver&s;aries of our re|ligion, or to the influence of the preju|ces which they laboured under? If the&s;e cau&s;es can account for the <HI>futility</HI> of their arguments, yet they le&s;&s;en the <HI>authority</HI> of their oppo&s;ition in the &s;ame proportion. They lead us to con&s;ider them as weak and prejudiced men, who ob&s;tinately with&s;tood the go&s;pel,
<PB N="325" REF="364">
and yet could produce only inconclu|&s;ive or incon&s;i&s;tent objections again&s;t it, and who&s;e judgment therefore can merit no regard. But &s;ince their rea&s;on|ings are confe&s;&s;edly in&s;ufficient, they e|ven afford a pre&s;umption for the truth of Chri&s;tianity. There can be no doubt that the&s;e men gave the be&s;t rea&s;ons which they could find, for their unbe|lief; if there had been better rea&s;ons, it is highly probable that they would have di&s;covered them. They had all po&s;&s;ible advantages for examining the evidences of Chri&s;tianity, and percei|ving their defects; if their exceptions be notwith&s;tanding frivolous, the rea|&s;on mu&s;t be, that there were none of greater con&s;equence. This is a gene|ral pre&s;umption, that the evidences of Chri&s;tianity are not liable to ju&s;t objec|tions, and that therefore its truth is fully e&s;tabli&s;hed; and, by affording this pre&s;umption, the oppo&s;ition of
<PB N="326" REF="365">
early Infidels has contributed to the confirmation of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>THEIR oppo&s;ition has not only in this manner afforded a general pre|&s;umption in favour of Chri&s;tianity; it has likewi&s;e given additional &s;trength to many of its direct and principal e|vidences. The proof of the truth of Chri&s;tianity from prophecy, derives no incon&s;iderable acce&s;&s;ion of force and clearne&s;s from this con&s;ideration, that the prophecies to which Je&s;us and his apo&s;tles appealed, and which Chri&s;ti|ans urge, were under&s;tood of the Me&s;|&s;iah, by the ancient Jews; it derives the greater acce&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e they not|with&s;tanding rejected Je&s;us. They re|jected him, only becau&s;e they pretend|ed that he an&s;wered not to the prophe|tical de&s;criptions of the Me&s;&s;iah: they never pretended that he or his apo&s;tles applied to him any predictions which
<PB N="327" REF="366">
did not truly relate to the Me&s;&s;iah. The predictions them&s;elves are &s;till ex|tant; we have the &s;ame opportunities of determining, what is the character delineated in them, that the Jews had. Let them be examined as they &s;tand: do they naturally indicate &s;uch a per|&s;on as Je&s;us was, or &s;uch a per&s;on as the Jews expected? a per&s;on who &s;hould have ari&s;en about the time when Je&s;us lived, or a per&s;on who has not yet ari&s;en? This is a que&s;tion which can be determined only by an attentive ex|amination of the &s;everal particular pre|dictions, and in which authority has no weight. The Jews had formed an idea of the Me&s;&s;iah incon&s;i&s;tent with the prophecies which they them&s;elves applied to him; they were led by it to reject Je&s;us; they were reduced to the greate&s;t difficulties in defending their infidelity; the&s;e could have been re|moved by their denying that &s;everal
<PB N="328" REF="367">
predictions related to the Me&s;&s;iah. Would they not have denied it, if they had found it in their power? But they per&s;i&s;ted in acknowledging it, tho' the acknowledgment rendered their infi|delity ab&s;urd and inexcu&s;eable. Can there be a &s;tronger proof, that it was extorted from them by evidence which they could not re&s;i&s;t? Their judgment concerning the general intention of the prophecies, would not have meri|ted &s;o great regard in any other &s;itua|tion. The modern Jews apply to other per&s;ons, many predictions which their fathers had univer&s;ally applied to the Me&s;&s;iah; and their opinion is urged as an objection again&s;t the proof of Chri|&s;tianity from prophecy. But it can have no authority: it is contrary to the uniform judgment of their ance&s;tors, who were as ob&s;tinate in their unbelief, and as anxious to defend it, as they can be; they have been led to adopt it,
<PB N="329" REF="368">
only by a determined &s;pirit of oppo&s;i|tion to the go&s;pel, after they found it impo&s;&s;ible to vindicate their infidelity on any other principles; and, after having made the attempt, they were never able to di&s;cover any proper ac|compli&s;hment of the&s;e predictions. Their conduct implies an acknowledg|ment, that if the predictions to which Chri&s;tians appeal, be truly predictions of the Me&s;&s;iah, the argument for Chri|&s;tianity from prophecy, is clear, con|clu&s;ive, and indi&s;putable.</P>
<P>That the miracles recorded in the go&s;pel, were really wrought, is proved by evidence &s;tronger and of more va|rious kinds, than perhaps any other ancient facts. Part of that evidence mu&s;t have been wanting, if none in that age had re&s;i&s;ted the go&s;pel. The te&s;timony of an enemy is one of the mo&s;t convincing proofs: the reality of the Chri&s;tian miracles is not only al|lowed, but in many in&s;tances explicit|ly
<PB N="330" REF="369">
a&s;&s;erted, by the ancient enemies of Chri&s;tianity, both Jews and Heathens: nothing can add greater &s;trength to the argument from miracles, &s;o far as that argument depends on the <HI>reality</HI> of the miracles. Even when Infidels were mo&s;t eager to depreciate the power by which the miracles of Chri&s;t were wrought, they could not deny that they were wrought. To what could their acknowledgment of the facts be owing, but to their firm belief of them? and from what could their belief of them proceed, but from their certain know|ledge of their truth? Their violent op|po&s;ition &s;hows that they wanted not inclination to di&s;pute them; their own|ing them notwith&s;tanding, proves that it was not in their power. Yet it is when a forgery is recent, that men have the be&s;t opportunities of detecting it: they who had the be&s;t opportunities of examining the Chri&s;tian miracles,
<PB N="331" REF="370">
were forced by the notoriety of their evidence, to own that the relations of them were no forgeries, but authentic hi&s;tories: to what purpo&s;e is it then for modern unbelievers to deny their truth? The evidence of their truth was com|pleated many ages ago; it extorted the acknowledgment of enemies; their acknowledgment renders the miracles of Chri&s;t as undeniable as any fact can be, and con&s;equently renders the truth of his religion, &s;o far as it is &s;upported by the&s;e miracles, as certain as it was po&s;&s;ible to render it.</P>
<P>The quick and exten&s;ive propaga|tion of Chri&s;tianity, is a &s;triking argu|ment of its truth and divinity; and it acquires a great acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength from the early and continued oppo&s;i|tion of Infidels. That Chri&s;tianity made &s;o great and rapid progre&s;s in &s;pight of the cruele&s;t per&s;ecutions, adds great weight to this argument; its having
<PB N="332" REF="371">
&s;pread in &s;pight of the keene&s;t oppo&s;i|tion in the way of rea&s;oning, adds no le&s;s weight to it. It &s;hows that the &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel was not owing to credulity. It cannot be pretended, that it was embraced merely becau&s;e its evidences were not examined: the acutene&s;s of the philo&s;opher, and the art of the orator, were employed to confute them: but their &s;olidity baffled all the efforts of both: the go&s;pel ro&s;e &s;uperior to all exceptions, it prevailed every where by the force of its con&s;pi|cuous truth. As it could not be cru&s;h|ed by violence, &s;o neither could it be overturned by argument.</P>
<P>THE advantages which Chri&s;tianity derives from the oppo&s;ition of ancient Infidels, extend &s;till farther; their at|tacks do not merely confirm &s;ome of its principal evidences: the manner in which they were carried on, has
<PB N="333" REF="372">
been improved into a di&s;tinct argu|ment for the truth of Chri&s;tianity. Its truth may be directly inferred from the te&s;timonies and conce&s;&s;ions of its an|cient adver&s;aries. I intend not to enu|merate the&s;e, or to urge the proof a|ri&s;ing from them, minutely or at large; for this has been done already<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>The truth of the Hi&s;tory of the Go&s;pel, made out by heathen Evidence.</HI> Edinburgh, 1741: And SHARPE'S <HI>Argu|ment in Defence of Chri&s;tianity, taken from the conce&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t ancient adver&s;aries, Jews and Pagans, Philo&s;ophers and Hi&s;torians.</HI></NOTE>: but to give a &s;hort repre&s;entation of the force of the argument, will be nece&s;&s;a|ry for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. That the Jews believed the time of the Me&s;&s;iah's appearance to be at hand when Je&s;us aro&s;e; that he lived in the period in which the writers of the New Te&s;ta|ment place him; that he was put to death at Jeru&s;alem; that his followers con&s;tantly affirmed that he had ri&s;en from the dead and a&s;cended into hea|ven,
<PB N="334" REF="373">
and produced &s;everal evidences of it; that he claimed a divine mi&s;&s;ion, and the character of the Me&s;&s;iah, and delivered his doctrine in the name of God; that he taught tho&s;e doctrines which the New Te&s;tament a&s;cribes to him; that he and his apo&s;tles perform|ed many wonderful works in &s;upport of the&s;e doctrines, and communicated to others the power of performing &s;i|milar works; that his di&s;ciples, after his death, publi&s;hed his religion thro' a great part of the world, re&s;olutely encountering the greate&s;t hard&s;hips and the cruele&s;t per&s;ecutions; that, notwith&s;tanding this, the go&s;pel, un|&s;upported by any worldly power, ob|tained a reception from multitudes: the&s;e are the principal facts of the go|&s;pel hi&s;tory, and the&s;e are put beyond doubt, by the confe&s;&s;ion of the ene|mies of the go&s;pel. Ancient Infidels give the mo&s;t expre&s;s te&s;timony to the
<PB N="335" REF="374">
truth of many of them: they admit them, and rea&s;on from them in de|fending their infidelity. They often acknowledge the facts which relate to the birth, the life, and the death of Je&s;us, and thence draw arguments again&s;t his religion. They a&s;cribe his miracles to his &s;kill in magic; but, by endeavouring to account for them in this manner, they plainly acknowledge that they were really performed by him. They either directly quote, or profe&s;&s;edly hint at, many doctrines, &s;entiments, and expre&s;&s;ions contained in the New Te&s;tament; they endea|vour to turn them to the di&s;advantage of Chri&s;tianity: but by this they ren|der it undeniable, that the New Te&s;ta|ment contains the very religion which Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles taught. They &s;ometimes pervert facts, they torture them into a &s;hape unfavourable to the go&s;pel; by this they &s;how, that they
<PB N="336" REF="375">
could do no more, that it was not in their power to deny them. Sometimes, when they cannot, by any plau&s;ible mi&s;repre&s;entation, wre&s;t them to the di&s;advantage of Chri&s;tianity, they inti|mate &s;u&s;picions of their truth, or they affect to deny them: but they deny them in &s;uch a way as indeed confirms them. In&s;tead of detecting their fal&s;e|hood by legitimate means, they &s;how that they could produce no evidence again&s;t them. They give us their rea|&s;ons for denying them: but the&s;e are &s;uch as cannot invalidate direct te&s;ti|mony for any matter of fact; they are &s;ometimes built on fal&s;e principles, at other times deduced by manife&s;t &s;ophi|&s;try, always precarious conclu&s;ions from general topics. To the affirma|tions of eye-witne&s;&s;es, contradicted by no other witne&s;&s;es, corroborated by a long train of connected events, they oppo&s;e ab&s;tract rea&s;onings and arbitra|ry
<PB N="337" REF="376">
conjectures. Such attempts to di&s;|prove any matter of fact, made by tho&s;e who mu&s;t have had in their pow|er, the <HI>proper</HI> means of confuting it, if any &s;uch there were, e&s;tabli&s;h the rea|lity of the fact even more &s;trongly than admitting it in &s;ilence. The enemies of the go&s;pel would not have combated its facts with objections of this kind, if they could have found any of another kind. Such efforts demon&s;trate their inclination to overturn the&s;e facts; yet they are employed only again&s;t &s;ome of them: the facts, therefore, which they do not once attempt to deny, mu&s;t be accounted &s;o indi&s;putable, that, a|gain&s;t them, all their ingenuity could not invent any exception. There are &s;ome facts, perhaps, related in the go|&s;pel hi&s;tory, of which they take no no|tice: but even the&s;e are confirmed by the te&s;timony which they give to other facts, for they are connected with
<PB N="338" REF="377">
them, and in a manner implied in them. It is only in matters of fact, that either the acknowledgment or the denial of contemporary per&s;ons is of importance; and in the&s;e, all ancient Infidels bear witne&s;s to the go&s;pel. Their conclu&s;ions from the facts, and their conjectures concerning the cau&s;es of them, are unfavourable to the go|&s;pel: but they have no authority, they are only matters of judgment or opi|nion, which may be freely canva&s;&s;ed and rejected; and they give weight to their te&s;timony for facts, they render it a te&s;timony in oppo&s;ition to their prejudices and their principles; &s;uch a te&s;timony, nothing but the force of notorious and inconte&s;tible truth could have extorted from them. The con|ce&s;&s;ions, then, of ancient Infidels &s;how that the hi&s;tory of the New Te&s;tament is true. The New Te&s;tament is no forgery of later ages; it is the original
<PB N="339" REF="378">
hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles; it was extant from the beginning of Chri|&s;tianity: it contains the very facts which the earlie&s;t Infidels mention, the very doctrines which they a&s;cribe to Chri&s;tians, the very expre&s;&s;ions which they quote, or to which they allude. That it is the genuine record of the re|ligion which Je&s;us taught, all tho&s;e un|believers who had opportunities of judging concerning that point, amply and explicitly bear witne&s;s. The facts related in it, are &s;uch as really happen|ed: as long as they were recent, they were &s;o notoriou&s;ly true, that even tho&s;e per&s;ons who would not admit their mo&s;t obvious con&s;equences, &s;el|dom attempted to deny any of the facts them&s;elves, and only expo&s;ed their own prejudice in the few in&s;tances in which they attempted it. Having been once &s;o notorious, they mu&s;t remain for ever indi&s;putably certain: all mo|dern
<PB N="340" REF="379">
objections again&s;t them mu&s;t be frivolous: di&s;tance of time may render the ab&s;urdity of calling them in que|&s;tion, le&s;s palpable and &s;triking than at fir&s;t, but the ab&s;urdity it&s;elf it can|not le&s;&s;en. On the authority of anci|ent Infidels, the facts of the go&s;pel hi|&s;tory ought to be held ab&s;olutely incon|te&s;tible: but, if they be true, Chri&s;ti|anity mu&s;t be likewi&s;e true. Ancient Infidels perceived not this con&s;equence; it is &s;urpri&s;ing how they could over|look what is &s;o obvious: there were, however, principles deeply imbibed by them, which may account for their blindne&s;s; but it is not nece&s;&s;ary for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to point out the&s;e. Modern Infidels too urge &s;ome objec|tions which &s;eem to go on the &s;uppo|&s;ition, that this con&s;equence is di&s;pu|table; but that they really are not in|&s;en&s;ible of its force, is plain from the pains they take, and the various topics
<PB N="341" REF="380">
they employ for overturning the go&s;pel hi&s;tory. In truth, no man who firmly believes the whole go&s;pel hi&s;tory, can find any difficulty in concluding, that the Chri&s;tian religion came from God. If the hi&s;tory be true, the whole of this religion mu&s;t be equally true: the prin|cipal doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, are im|plied in the hi&s;tory it&s;elf: they are but parts of it: the whole &s;y&s;tem of Chri|&s;tianity, claims a reception on the au|thority of the teacher; the evidence of his authority, ari&s;es from the very facts recorded in the hi&s;tory, which, if they indeed happened, render it certain that he came from God.</P>
<P>THUS, if there had not been Infidels in early ages, we &s;hould have wanted &s;ome part of the evidence which we now have, for the truth of Chri&s;tianity. At any rate, there would have doubt|le&s;s been &s;ufficient evidence: but this
<PB N="342" REF="381">
addition is very con&s;iderable. It is when an impo&s;ture has been &s;uffered to go on for ages, before it is inquired into, that it becomes difficult to detect it. In this ca&s;e, the real circum&s;tan|ces which attended its ri&s;e and progre&s;s, are forgotten; all means of bringing a direct proof of deceit, are &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;arily lo&s;t by length of time: men may &s;till find rea&s;on to reject it, but it is only becau&s;e its nature renders it &s;u&s;picious, becau&s;e it contains internal marks of fal&s;ehood. But there never was an impo&s;ture which e&s;caped detec|tion, when it was examined at its very ri&s;e: if it was carried on with &s;o great &s;ecrecy and art, as to elude a full con|futation, yet there have always occur|red &s;ome po&s;itive pre&s;umptions of fal&s;e|hood. Chri&s;tianity was examined in its earlie&s;t infancy, it grew up under the watchful eye of oppo&s;ition; all the &s;teps of its progre&s;s were ob&s;erved with
<PB N="343" REF="382">
the &s;tricte&s;t attention, by its mo&s;t inve|terate enemies: the a&s;&s;aults of ancient unbelievers are everla&s;ting monuments of all this. Neverthele&s;s, it was not confuted; there were not even produ|ced any direct pre&s;umptions of its be|ing an impo&s;ture; nay all attempts to detect it, i&s;&s;ued in affording, in many ways, new evidence of its truth. If it had been an impo&s;ture, could its fate have been &s;o &s;ignally the rever&s;e of the fates of all the impo&s;tures which ever the world knew? The whole que|&s;tion concerning the truth of Chri&s;ti|anity, may almo&s;t be fairly reduced to this &s;ingle point: Did ancient Infi|dels give full proof that it was an im|po&s;ture, by detecting the methods of deceit and artifice, by which it was carried on, and rendered &s;ucce&s;sful? If they did not, Chri&s;tianity could be no impo&s;ture. That all their attempts failed, that they contributed, in con|tradiction to their intention, to the
<PB N="344" REF="383">
confirmation of Chri&s;tianity, is a po&s;i|tive proof of its truth. If you would, after this, convict it of impo&s;ture by internal characters, they mu&s;t be &s;uch as render its truth ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;i|ble, they mu&s;t be in&s;tances either of plain ab&s;urdity or of immorality: any thing &s;hort of this, cannot overbalance the evidence of truth ari&s;ing hence, that no impo&s;ture was detected by the mo&s;t laborious and invidious &s;crutiny, on the fir&s;t appearance of Chri&s;tianity; it is only precarious rea&s;oning, plau&s;ible &s;peculation, and indirect pre&s;umption, oppo&s;ed to direct proof and indubita|ble facts. So great is the advantage which Chri&s;tianity derives from the op|po&s;ition of its ancient adver&s;aries, that this oppo&s;ition at once affords a &s;trong argument for the divinity of Chri&s;tiani|ty, and renders all internal objections again&s;t it, of little force, except they amount to a &s;trict demon&s;tration of its fal&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD>The advantages which CHRISTIANITY has derived from
oppo&s;ition in general.</HEAD>
<P>THE advantages of which we have hitherto taken notice, are pecu|liar to the oppo&s;ition of <HI>ancient</HI> Infidels. But, from oppo&s;ition, Chri&s;tianity has derived advantages of a more general nature. The attacks which have been made upon it by Infidels in every age, have contributed to render its truth the more con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>INFIDELS have always urged their objections in a way which &s;trongly im|plies the goodne&s;s of the cau&s;e oppo&s;ed by them, and which heightens the ef|fect
<PB N="346" REF="385">
produced on the mind, by the di|rect evidences of the truth of the go|&s;pel. It is univer&s;ally allowed, that di&s;|hone&s;t methods of defence are preju|dicial to any cau&s;e: they infu&s;e a &s;u|&s;picion that it is a bad cau&s;e; and when they are adopted by all without exception, who patronize that cau&s;e, the &s;u&s;picion is rarely groundle&s;s. Such conduct proceeds from the impo&s;&s;ibili|ty of defending the cau&s;e by better means. If, then, di&s;hone&s;t arts have been employed by the whole tribe of infidel writers, this will yield a gene|ral pre&s;umption, that infidelity is in|defen&s;ible, and con&s;equently that Chri|&s;tianity is true; a pre&s;umption which will operate powerfully on the princi|ples of human nature. But that this has been the conduct of Infidels, is e|vident from their writings. Partial and unfair quotations from the &s;crip|tures; gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entations of the

To others it can|not fail to appear a&s;toni&s;hing; but le&s;t the&s;e &s;hould reckon it incredible, I &s;hall hint at a very few in&s;tances of the &s;everal &s;orts of arts, which have been enumerated. I have been at no pains to &s;elect the mo&s;t flagrant in&s;tances; I mention ju&s;t &s;uch as happen fir&s;t to occur to my memory. Of quotations partially made, or gro&s;sly mi&s;applied, <HI>Chri&s;tianity-not founded on argument,</HI> tho' a book of no large &s;ize, and written by a man far from being de&s;titute of acutene&s;s or ingenuity, will af|ford perhaps a hundred in&s;tances. By almo&s;t every Infidel, the go&s;pel is repre&s;ented as encouraging &s;uper&s;tition, per&s;e|cution, and tyranny over men's con&s;ciences; things mo&s;t ab|horrent from its genuine &s;pirit. Occa&s;ion has been taken for this mi&s;repre&s;entation, from the vices of profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, committed in ab&s;olute contradiction to the genius of the New Te&s;tament; and to give it countenance, the&s;e vices have been magnified on the one hand, and on the other hand the hor|rors of Pagan idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition, and the &s;everities of the heathens again&s;t the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, have been palliated. The Alcoran has been extolled, in contradiction to truth, that it might &s;eem a rival to the Bible. In order to &s;ee, how rea|dy they are to &s;uppo&s;e or to a&s;&s;ert, whatever &s;uits their pur|po&s;e, you need but read the &s;uppo&s;itions which Mr Hume makes with regard to Alexander of Pontus, the miraculous cure a|&s;cribed to Ve&s;pa&s;ian, or the te&s;timony of Cardinal de Retz, without any authority from the writers whom he quotes, &s;ome|times even in oppo&s;ition to their authority. In order to di&s;|credit the apo&s;tles, how often have Infidels reckoned it &s;uffici|ent, that the apo&s;tles might have been impo&s;tors, or enthu&s;ia&s;ts, or &s;omething produced by a &s;trange mixture of the&s;e charac|ters? But they offer no proof; they even attempt not to re|concile the imputation with the hi&s;tory of the apo&s;tles; they require of Chri&s;tians to prove the negative, that the apo&s;tles were not impo&s;tors nor enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</NOTE>. They have been occa&s;ionally

pointed out by the defenders of Chri|&s;tianity, and fully a&s;certained. Many &s;pecies of &s;uch artifices might be enu|merated, and many in&s;tances collected under each head. But we decline en|tering

on the detail. Merely to men|tion the various arts of &s;ophi&s;try em|ployed, would not produce conviction of the ju&s;tice of the charge; and to col|lect multitudes of particulars in &s;up|port of it, would be tedious and un|plea&s;ant. We &s;hall, therefore, enlarge only on a few ob&s;ervations &s;o obvious from the whole tenor of the infidel writings, that there will be no need to quote examples for &s;upporting them.</P>
<P>It would be curious to trace the ob|jections again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, from the earlie&s;t ages to the pre&s;ent time. This connected view of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive efforts of unbelievers, might &s;ugge&s;t many re|flections which would confirm our faith. No per&s;on who has at all con&s;idered the oppo&s;ition of Infidels in this point of view, can have failed to remark, that they have, one after another, re|peated the &s;ame objections very often, varied perhaps in form, but without
<PB N="350" REF="389">
being at any pains to confute the an|&s;wers which Chri&s;tians have returned to them. That there is no degree of force or plau&s;ibility at all in the&s;e an|&s;wers, the mo&s;t confirmed Infidel, if he be not de&s;titute of candour, will not be hardy enough to affirm. If they de&s;troy not the objections altogether, they certainly in many in&s;tances weak|en them very con&s;iderably. Yet, with|out taking any notice of them, the ob|jections are repeatedly urged. The defenders of Chri&s;tianity have acted an oppo&s;ite part: they take notice of eve|ry new objection that is rai&s;ed again&s;t the go&s;pel; they at lea&s;t endeavour to &s;how by a particular examination of it, that it is not &s;ufficient to overturn the go&s;pel; they thus provide mankind with the means of judging fairly be|tween them and their adver&s;aries. This difference of manner will be obvious to every per&s;on who has the lea&s;t ac|quaintance
<PB N="351" REF="390">
with the controver&s;y; and a thorough &s;crutiny will render it &s;till more &s;triking. Did &s;uch a difference appear between two di&s;putants in any one in&s;tance, it would induce every con&s;iderate &s;pectator, previous to a mi|nute examination of the &s;everal argu|ments produced, to believe that he who u&s;es the latter method, is the abler, as well as the fairer advocate. But, in the que&s;tion concerning the truth of Chri&s;tianity, this difference takes place univer&s;ally: the former manner characteri&s;eth the defenders of infidelity, almo&s;t without exception<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is &s;o notoriou&s;ly and confe&s;&s;edly the manner of In|fidels, that it is almo&s;t &s;uperfluous to appeal to any particular in&s;tances. Let the reader peru&s;e any of the late&s;t works of Infidels, and try how many objections again&s;t Chri&s;tianity he can find in them, which had not been often moved, and often an&s;wered before. Let him examine, for example, how many of tho&s;e arguments, for the perfection or &s;ufficiency of natural religion, and again&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity and u&s;efulne&s;s of revelation, which, without any notice taken of any replies to them, are urged with &s;o great confidence and o&s;tentation in <HI>The philo&s;o|phical works of Lord Bolingbroke,</HI> or enforced with &s;o great e|loquence in the celebrated <HI>Creed of the Savoyard Curate,</HI> had not been formerly moved by Lord Herbert and Dr Tindal, and confuted, or at lea&s;t much invalidated, by almo&s;t every author who wrote again&s;t them.</NOTE>;

the latter manner is pre&s;erved by Chri|&s;tian apologi&s;ts, at lea&s;t by all of them whom &s;en&s;ible and rational Chri&s;tians e&s;teem. The natural conclu&s;ion is, that this characteri&s;tical difference ari&s;es from a difference between the cau&s;es which they maintain: and certainly we will not be di&s;po&s;ed to think mo&s;t favourably of that cau&s;e which leads its votaries to a method of defence, &s;trong|ly marked with negligence at lea&s;t, if not with di&s;ingenuity.

<P>Again, every per&s;on who peru&s;es the writings of Infidels, mu&s;t perceive
<PB N="353" REF="392">
that not only different per&s;ons, but e|ven the &s;ame per&s;ons, employ <HI>incon&s;i&s;t|ent</HI> principles in rea&s;oning again&s;t Chri|&s;tianity. Men vary &s;o much in their apprehen&s;ions of things, that different per&s;ons, arguing on almo&s;t any &s;ubject, adopt incompatible principles. Chri|&s;tians have &s;ometimes given advantage to Infidels, by the fal&s;ehood of the prin|ciples on which &s;ome of them have built their rea&s;onings, as well as by the weakne&s;s of the rea&s;onings them&s;elves. Were no more chargeable on Infidels, than that they are in their arguments incon&s;i&s;tent with one another, a con|clu&s;ion to the di&s;advantage of their cau&s;e, could not with ju&s;tice be inferred. One remark, however, may be made even on this view of the ca&s;e. The mi&s;taken principles of one Chri&s;tian writer have been detected and expo&s;ed by other Chri&s;tian writers, without re|&s;erve. But Infidels, in di&s;&s;olubly leagued
<PB N="354" REF="393">
together by the &s;ingle tie of unbelief, &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid confuting one ano|ther: this conduct &s;hows a determined re&s;olution to &s;upport a beloved cau&s;e by all po&s;&s;ible means; and the cau&s;e which in&s;pires all its votaries with &s;uch a re&s;olution, is not likely to be the cau&s;e of truth. But what chiefly de|&s;erves attention is, that there is &s;carce any Infidel writer who, in rea&s;oning a|gain&s;t Chri&s;tianity, does not without &s;cruple admit principles contradictory to one another. Were this conduct pe|culiar to a few, it would only &s;how that certain individuals were weak enough not to di&s;cern the contradiction, or di&s;ingenuous enough not to own it. But it is &s;o general, that one Infidel author of a few pages, cannot perhaps be na|med, who is innocent of the charge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In&s;tead of multiplying in&s;tances from a variety of authors, I &s;hall mention one or two, in Mr <HI>Hume's e&s;&s;ay on miracles.</HI> P. 202, <Q REND="inline">"It appears that no te&s;timony for any kind of miracle can ever po&s;&s;ibly amount to a probability, much le&s;s to a proof."</Q> (See al&s;o p. 180, 194, 196.) P. 203,  <Q REND="inline">"I own, there may po&s;&s;ibly be miracles, or violations of the u&s;ual cour&s;e of nature, of &s;uch a kind as to admit of proof from human te&s;timony."</Q> The contradiction here is direct. I might add the contrariety which there is between his a&s;&s;ertion, page 183, that no mira|cle was ever atte&s;ted by a &s;ufficient number of men, &s;uch by their character and circum&s;tances as to merit credit; and the account which he gives, page 195, &amp;c. of the manner in which the miracles wrought at the tomb of the Abb&eacute; Paris, are atte&s;ted. The&s;e in&s;tances are the more to the purpo&s;e, for two rea&s;ons; becau&s;e the e&s;&s;ay con&s;i&s;ts but of a few pages, and be|cau&s;e Mr Hume is unque&s;tionably &s;uperior in penetration to al|mo&s;t all the writers who have appeared on the &s;ide of infideli|ty.

<PB N="355" REF="394">
A good cau&s;e needs not to be &s;upport|ed by &s;uch means; it does not natu|rally put men on the u&s;e of them. This is not the kind of attachment which truth in&s;pires; it is the bigotry which error u&s;ually begets. Truth leads
<PB N="356" REF="395">
forward its votaries in a plain road; it is error that involves men in a la|byrinth, and bewilders them in crook|ed paths. The principles of the be&s;t defenders of Chri&s;tianity, are con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves; among all the prin|ciples from which its truth is deduced in the New Te&s;tament, the avowed &s;tandard of our religion, there &s;ub&s;i&s;ts the mo&s;t perfect harmony.&mdash;What has been &s;aid, may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of the ways in which the evidence of Chri|&s;tianity has been corroborated by the methods in which Infidels have mana|ged their attacks upon it.</P>
<P>BUT the oppo&s;ition of Infidels has contributed, &s;till more directly, to add light and force to the evidences of Chri|&s;tianity, by the conduct which it has led Chri&s;tians to pur&s;ue. It gives Chri|&s;tians a natural occa&s;ion to explain the real &s;trength of the evidences of their

religion, to point out the &s;everal cir|cum&s;tances from which that &s;trength ari&s;es, to &s;how in what particular man|ner each circum&s;tance promotes it, and to detect the fallacies of all the rea&s;on|ings which are employed again&s;t the go&s;pel. The New Te&s;tament informs us of a very early in&s;tance in which oppo&s;ition produced this effect. It led an illiterate per&s;on, by the mere force of his own under&s;tanding, without in|&s;piration, to a &s;olid confutation of an objection again&s;t a particular proof of our Saviour's mi&s;&s;ion, and to a convin|cing explication of the force of that proof. When the council had exami|ned a blind man to whom our Saviour had re&s;tored &s;ight, concerning all the circum&s;tances of the cure, they decla|red that Je&s;us mu&s;t be an impo&s;tor; be|cau&s;e, in performing it, he had broken the law of the Sabbath; <HI>This man is not of God, becau&s;e he keepeth not the Sabbath|day.</HI>
<PB N="358" REF="397">
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John ix. 16.</NOTE>.

The force of this rea&s;oning was &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible, that it utterly &s;ilenced the rulers.

<P><PB N="359" REF="398">
The various objections which have been rai&s;ed again&s;t the evidences of Chri&s;tianity, have always produced &s;i|milar effects. By the publication of them, every exception that can, with any &s;how of rea&s;on, be taken again&s;t the&s;e evidences, is gradually brought forth; every doubt concerning them, is propo&s;ed; every difficulty attending any of them, is &s;tated: An opportuni|ty is thus given of removing every thing which &s;eems to weaken their force, or can hinder the mind from yielding its a&s;&s;ent to them. Chri&s;tians have never declined embracing this op|portunity: they have readily taken no|tice of the arguments of Infidels, and examined them; they have pointed out the fal&s;e principles from which they are deduced, and the &s;ophi&s;tical rea&s;onings by which they are carried on; they have evinced, that, notwith|&s;tanding them, the evidence of Chri&s;ti|anity
<PB N="360" REF="399">
remains entire. The natural tendency of all this is, that every thing of importance to the proof of Chri&s;tia|nity &s;hall be accurately canva&s;&s;ed; e|very po&s;&s;ible objection moved, and ei|ther directly an&s;wered, or obviated &s;o far as the weakne&s;s of the human facul|ties permits, and &s;o far as &s;imilar ob|jections on other &s;ubjects can be obvi|ated: and this has been, in a great mea&s;ure, the actual effect. In what pre|ci&s;e degree this effect has already taken place, they are be&s;t qualified to judge, who have deliberately con&s;idered all that has been &s;aid for and again&s;t Chri|&s;tianity, and impartially compared the rea&s;onings on one &s;ide with tho&s;e on the other. If a per&s;on has attended on|ly to objections again&s;t the truth of Chri&s;tianity, but has been at no pains to learn what an&s;wers have been re|turned to them, or has not weighed the an&s;wers with the &s;ame candour as
<PB N="361" REF="400">
the objections; and &s;hould neverthe|le&s;s determine, that all the arguments of Infidels have not been &s;olidly con|futed, that the &s;everal evidences of Chri&s;tianity have not been fully vindi|cated, after allowing every difficulty and objection its real weight, and that the&s;e evidences together do not con&s;ti|tute a proof of the truth of Chri&s;tiani|ty, perfectly &s;uited to the nature of the &s;ubject, the highe&s;t that the ca&s;e can po&s;&s;ibly admit, fully &s;atisfying to the under&s;tanding, and &s;uperior, by many circum&s;tances of advan|tage, to the proofs of numberle&s;s conclu&s;ions which are adopted with unre&s;erved a&s;&s;urance; &s;uch a per&s;on is undeniably an incompetent judge; for he is ignorant of many things ne|ce&s;&s;ary for deciding the que&s;tion with under&s;tanding. Whether any <HI>Infidels</HI> have gone through all the examination requi&s;ite for their giving a ju&s;t deci|&s;ion,
<PB N="362" REF="401">
it mu&s;t be left to their con&s;cien|ces to judge: their writings bear ma|ny marks of their having neglected it, of &s;ome of which we have already ta|ken notice. It is certain that many Chri&s;tians have made a full examina|tion; their writings &s;how that they have; and yet they have continued Chri&s;ti|ans. This is &s;ome pre&s;umption, that the evidences of Chri&s;tianity are alrea|dy brought wholly or nearly to the &s;tate into which oppo&s;ition to <HI>truth</HI> tends to bring its evidence; every ma|terial objection urged, and fully an|&s;wered. If any per&s;on doubts of this, let him examine without prejudice. Whether, on a full examination, every per&s;on will perceive this to be the &s;tate of the controver&s;y, and find rea&s;on to become a Chri&s;tian, I will not take it upon me to pronounce: men are in|fluenced in their judgments by &s;o va|rious principles, that it is impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="363" REF="402">
to &s;ay, what will be the i&s;&s;ue of their application to any &s;ubject. But we may a&s;&s;ert, that there is no contradic|tory in&s;tance: tho&s;e Infidels who have boa&s;ted mo&s;t confidently of fair exami|nation and deep inve&s;tigation, have notwith&s;tanding betrayed either gro&s;s ignorance or wilful inattention, with re&s;pect to many things mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to the evidence of Chri&s;tianity, and to the vindication of it from objections. But it is by the general principles of rea&s;oning, that a compari&s;on ought to be &s;tated between the attacks upon Chri&s;tianity, and the defences of it: and, judging by the&s;e, nothing can be clearer than that the evidences of Chri&s;tianity have not, in the cour&s;e of a long and eager controver&s;y, been confuted; that, on the contrary, all the exceptions again&s;t them have been obviated by ju&s;t argument, and that con&s;equently the force of the&s;e eviden|ces
<PB N="364" REF="403">
has been farther a&s;certained and ju&s;tified, than it was at fir&s;t, and new light thrown upon the truth of our re|ligion. No argument employed by Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles, in &s;upport of their mi&s;&s;ion, has been overthrown by Infi|dels. Many of their objections have been proved to be frivolous, all of them to be inconclu&s;ive. Arguments have been advanced for Chri&s;tianity, which Infidels have not &s;o much as attempted to an&s;wer, and which mu&s;t therefore be held &s;olid and legitimate. In con|&s;equence of the exceptions of unbelie|vers, many arguments have been &s;hown to advantage, have received new illu|&s;trations, and have been pro&s;ecuted with greater preci&s;ion and depth. No|where can there be found greater con|fu&s;ion of thought or weaker rea&s;oning, than in the writings of Infidels; no|where more accurate and unexception|able argumentation, than in the an|&s;wers
<PB N="365" REF="404">
of Chri&s;tians. For the truth of all this, we appeal to the works of both. If it be an advantage to Chri|&s;tianity, to have its evidence clearly explained, fully illu&s;trated, carefully vindicated, and traced up to the gene|ral principles of human nature, there can be no doubt that it has derived advantage from the oppo&s;ition of un|believers.</P>
<P>THEIR oppo&s;ition has not only pro|duced a full defence of the evidences of Chri&s;tianity, but likewi&s;e occa&s;ioned their being &s;et in a great variety of lights. Men differ &s;o much in the turn of their under&s;tandings, that truth mu&s;t be placed in many different atti|tudes, in order to its being either con|ceived or embraced by all. An argu|ment, by being turned into a particu|lar form, will often in&s;tantly &s;trike a per&s;on on whom it had no influence
<PB N="366" REF="405">
when it was pro&s;ecuted under a diffe|rent form. When a man propo&s;es an argument, in which he has no &s;u&s;pi|cion of ob&s;curity or uncertainty, and again&s;t which he has no particular ex|ceptions in view, he &s;atisfies him&s;elf with expre&s;&s;ing it in the manner which appears mo&s;t natural to him&s;elf, or which happens fir&s;t to occur. But when he finds that its force is not per|ceived, e&s;pecially when particular ex|ceptions are taken again&s;t it, he endea|vours to &s;et it in different lights, and to turn it into every po&s;&s;ible &s;hape, that, in &s;ome one of them, its force and the futility of the exceptions again&s;t it, may come to be acknowledged. If an|other per&s;on adopts the argument, he may be able to give it a turn which the former never thought of, and which may render it peculiarly fit for con|vincing &s;ome who would have other|wi&s;e with&s;tood it. At fir&s;t, the evi|dences
<PB N="367" REF="406">
of the go&s;pel were propo&s;ed in a very &s;imple manner: but the objec|tions rai&s;ed again&s;t them, led Chri&s;tians to turn them into various &s;hapes. E|very new objection, and even every old objection urged in a different man|ner, gave occa&s;ion to &s;ome new illu|&s;tration of the proof of Chri&s;tianity af|fected by it. In how many &s;triking lights, for in&s;tance, is Origen alone led by the &s;everal objections of Cel&s;us, to exhibit the argument for Chri&s;tiani|ty, deduced from its quick and exten|&s;ive propagation? The reality of the Chri&s;tian miracles was originally a&s;&s;ert|ed by a naked rehear&s;al of the miracles them&s;elves, and of the circum&s;tances in which they were wrought: but, when objections again&s;t this evidence were multiplied, they led men to many new methods of repre&s;enting it. In con&s;equence of one objection, the weight of the &s;everal real circum&s;tances
<PB N="368" REF="407">
attending the&s;e miracles, was e&s;timated, and &s;hown to be &s;ufficient to exclude all &s;u&s;picion of deceit. Another ob|jection led men to examine the preci&s;e force of that te&s;timony by which we are a&s;&s;ured that the&s;e miracles were wrought. Other objections have been the occa&s;ions of pointing out the diffe|rence between the Chri&s;tian miracles and tho&s;e fal&s;e wonders, by compari|&s;on with which, attempts have been made to depreciate them; of a&s;certain|ing the nature and degree of that a&s;|&s;ent which is due to te&s;timony; of at|tending to all the principles and pro|pen&s;ities of the human mind, which can be &s;uppo&s;ed in any way to affect our belief of extraordinary or miracu|lous facts. The objections which have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively rai&s;ed again&s;t the con|nexion between miracles and doctrines, and the &s;everal hypothe&s;es which have been contrived for accounting for the
<PB N="369" REF="408">
wonderful works a&s;cribed to Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, without allowing them to be proofs of a divine mi&s;&s;ion, have gi|ven occa&s;ion to repre&s;ent that connex|ion in almo&s;t as great a variety of lights, in &s;ome one or other of which it can &s;carce fail to appear undeniable to eve|ry per&s;on who takes the pains to under|&s;tand it, and gives &s;cope to his natural principles of belief. The excellence of the Chri&s;tian religion has been called in que&s;tion; objections of all po&s;&s;ible kinds, have been formed again&s;t its doc|trines and its laws: the con&s;equence has been, a di&s;play of its excellence in every po&s;&s;ible point of view. It has been &s;hown that it contains no tenet which rea&s;on can evince to be fal&s;e, no precept which con&s;cience can di&s;ap|prove. It has been &s;hown that it re|publi&s;hes a &s;y&s;tem of natural religion, perfectly conformable to the &s;ounde&s;t deductions of rea&s;on, and teaches it

with &s;ingular purity, per&s;picuity, and authority; that its peculiar doctrines not only are con&s;i&s;tent with all that rea&s;on teaches us, but form a well connected &s;cheme of principles; agree|able to the analogy of nature; for con|firmation of which, after they are re|vealed, we can di&s;cover many argu|ments; which account for facts, and clear up difficulties in the actual &s;tate of things, otherwi&s;e inexplicable; which convert many dubious conjectures of rea&s;on into certainty; which fall in with, and &s;upport the wavering expec|tations of nature; which &s;uit the hopes and the fears of mankind; which ex|tend our pro&s;pect and brighten our views where the light of nature fails us; which di&s;cover to us a &s;cheme of things, the exact counterpart of that with which rea&s;on and experience bring us acquainted, and, together with it, ma|king up one plan of providence. It
<PB N="371" REF="410">
has been evinced, that all its doctrines are u&s;eful and important in the highe&s;t degree, calculated for the noble&s;t end, for promoting the pre&s;ent improvement and joy, and the eternal perfection and felicity of mankind, directly &s;ub&s;ervient to this end, affording motives to vir|tue, the &s;tronge&s;t in them&s;elves, the be&s;t adapted both to our con&s;titution and to our &s;tate, and of the mo&s;t various kinds, fit to lay hold on every princi|ple of action, and to influence the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite tempers. It has been proved, that its moral precepts are ab&s;olutely proper, pure, and complete, and its po&s;itive precepts immediately condu|cive to real goodne&s;s; that its laws a&s;|certain our duty with the greate&s;t pre|ci&s;ion, and impre&s;s a &s;en&s;e of its obli|gation with the greate&s;t force, while its doctrines give us the mo&s;t powerful inducements to fulfil it, and provide us with the mo&s;t natural means of ful|filling

it. Chri&s;tianity has been compa|red with other religions, and with the noble&s;t di&s;coveries of the be&s;t philo&s;o|phers, and demon&s;trated to be va&s;tly &s;uperior to them all. In a word, it has been &s;hown to have all the excellence which can be derived from &s;ub&s;ervi|ence to the mo&s;t important end, and to have every &s;ort of excellence con&s;i|&s;tent with its being immediately &s;ub|&s;ervient to that end, every &s;ort of ex|cellence which can &s;atisfy the under|&s;tanding, &s;trike the imagination, or en|gage the heart. It is &s;ufficient, and all which can be rea&s;onably de&s;ired, that real evidence be di&s;played in one proper light; but when it is &s;et in va|rious lights, it becomes much fitter for convincing all, and for heightening the a&s;&s;urance of each. That the evidence of Chri&s;tianity has been propo&s;ed in this advantageous manner, the op|po&s;ition of Infidels has been the prin|cipal
<PB N="373" REF="412">
occa&s;ion: it has led many diffe|rent per&s;ons to &s;tate that evidence, e|very one in the way which was mo&s;t &s;uitable to his own turn of thinking; and different repre&s;entations of it have been naturally &s;ugge&s;ted by the variety of objections urged again&s;t it.</P>
<P>THERE is a very great difference of abilities among mankind; and they who have the lea&s;t &s;hare, are very apt to make a fal&s;e e&s;timate of their own powers. On this account, as well as on many others, when any que&s;tion is long agitated, many weak arguments will unavoidably be employed. Some Chri&s;tians have, no doubt, made fri|volous ob&s;ervations, and u&s;ed incon|clu&s;ive arguments, in explaining and &s;upporting the evidences of their reli|gion, and refuting the objections of un|believers. They have appealed to e|vidence which could yield no proof of
<PB N="374" REF="413">
truth or divinity; and they have repre|&s;ented real and ju&s;t evidence in an im|proper manner. Were there no oppo|&s;ition, this might not be taken notice of. It &s;eems unnece&s;&s;ary to expo&s;e the weakne&s;s of others, when the detection of it can &s;erve no good purpo&s;e: the benevolent only pity it, and the more rigid &s;atisfy them&s;elves with de&s;pi&s;ing it. But the &s;pirit of infidelity fails not to lay hold of every thing of this &s;ort. However &s;paring unbelievers are, in undertaking a regular confutation of &s;olid an&s;wers made to their objections, their writings &s;how, that they are not backward to make all the advantage po&s;&s;ible of the <HI>mi&s;takes</HI> of Chri&s;tians. When Infidels are awake to ob&s;erve the&s;e, Chri&s;tians come likewi&s;e to have a &s;trong motive to expo&s;e and rectify the fal&s;e rea&s;onings of one another; it is conducive to a valuable end; it is nece&s;&s;ary for preventing their being

unfairly turned again&s;t Chri&s;tianity it|&s;elf; and con&s;equently it is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the meeke&s;t benevo|lence. By the&s;e means, the oppo&s;i|tion of Infidels has a very powerful tendency to bani&s;h inconclu&s;ive rea|&s;onings from the defence of Chri&s;tia|nity.</P>
<P>It has been often a&s;&s;erted, that mo&s;t of the ancient Chri&s;tian writers u&s;e &s;e|veral weak arguments in their apolo|gies. Infidels triumph in the ob&s;erva|tion, and repre&s;ent the&s;e in&s;tances of fal&s;e rea&s;oning as even &s;ubver&s;ive of the go&s;pel. That there are &s;uch in|&s;tances, believers readily acknowledge; and, on account of them, &s;ome enter|tain a much lower opinion of the&s;e an|cients, than can be fairly ju&s;tified from their writings. Suppo&s;e that many of their &s;entiments and rea&s;onings are &s;o weak, that a modern of very mode|rate abilities would avoid them; yet
<PB N="376" REF="415">
an excu&s;e may be pleaded for this: it is common to them with almo&s;t all the philo&s;ophers of antiquity. There is not perhaps any difference between ancient and modern writers, more characteri&s;tical than this; the moderns, when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any con&s;iderable de|gree of excellence, pre&s;erve an uni|formity and equality, in matter, &s;enti|ment, and rea&s;oning, which is want|ing in the ancients. In the&s;e latter, there is a &s;urpri&s;ing mixture of the fi|ne&s;t &s;entiments with the meane&s;t or the fal&s;e&s;t, of the ju&s;te&s;t rea&s;onings with the &s;illie&s;t cavils. In the writings of Plato, of Cicero, of almo&s;t any one of the mo&s;t admired philo&s;ophers, innu|merable in&s;tances may be pointed out. If few moderns ri&s;e to their excellence in &s;ome parts of their works, it is cer|tain however that defects and ab&s;urdi|ties, &s;o gro&s;s as may be found in other parts, are not chargeable on any mo|dern
<PB N="377" REF="416">
author, who has, in the judgment of the world, even reached mediocrity. Whatever defects are ob&s;ervable in the Chri&s;tian fathers, I know few of their apologies for their religion, in which the ju&s;t rea&s;onings do not bear as great a proportion to the puerile cavils, as in almo&s;t any work of the &s;ame length, of any the mo&s;t celebrated ancient. It may be added, that very many of their fal&s;e &s;entiments and inconclu&s;ive rea|&s;onings, were derived from the pre|vailing opinions of the times, were common to them with the mo&s;t emi|nent of their contemporaries, and be|long to &s;ubjects which are foreign to Chri&s;tianity, and on which it was not its bu&s;ine&s;s to give them light. This is in rea&s;on &s;ufficient for their vindication: and what has happened to their puerilities and cavils, exempli|fies the topic on which we are now in|&s;i&s;ting. Chri&s;tians have concurred with
<PB N="378" REF="417">
Infidels in detecting them; they are ge|nerally exploded. They would per|haps have been abandoned, tho' Infi|dels had given no occa&s;ion: but they would not probably have been &s;o ex|pre&s;sly di&s;claimed, or &s;o profe&s;&s;edly confuted. It often happens, that ve|ry exceptionable po&s;itions are not &s;o quickly bani&s;hed as they ought to be; there will always be &s;ome per&s;ons inju|dicious enough to adopt the weake&s;t things that have been advanced by o|thers: but this happens on all &s;ubjects, and can on no &s;ubject be ju&s;tly a&s;cri|bed to any other cau&s;e, but the folly of the&s;e individuals. It is no wonder that it &s;ometimes happens likewi&s;e with re&s;pect to the evidences of Chri&s;tianity. But the oppo&s;ition of Infidels has a ve|ry &s;trong tendency to make all &s;en&s;ible Chri&s;tians extremely cautious in chu|&s;ing their weapons, wary in examining the propriety of every principle on
<PB N="379" REF="418">
which they build, attentive to the &s;ound|ne&s;s and &s;trength of every argument which they urge, &s;crupulous about the truth of every deduction which they make; in a word, careful that the de|fences which they offer for their religi|on, be in all re&s;pects beyond rea&s;onable exception. A &s;iege not only proves the &s;trength of &s;ome parts of a fortification, but al&s;o di&s;covers the weak parts, and &s;hows what eminences command, or give advantage again&s;t any part of it; and thus &s;ugge&s;ts the nece&s;&s;ity and the means of improving what is in&s;uffici|ent, and removing what is dangerous, &s;o that the whole may become &s;tronger than before. In like manner, while the attacks of Infidels give fuller convic|tion of the &s;olidity of the proof of Chri|&s;tianity in general, and of the force of many of the particular arguments u&s;ed in &s;upport of it, they at the &s;ame time expo&s;e the frivolous arguments which
<PB N="380" REF="419">
the weakne&s;s of individuals has intro|duced, lead to the &s;ub&s;titution of better in their place, and to the removal of all the rubbi&s;h by which the defence of Chri&s;tianity was ob&s;tructed. Fal&s;e prin|ciples, which have been injudiciou&s;ly adopted, are laid a&s;ide; lame rea&s;on|ings from true principles, are abandon|ed. When the oppo&s;ition of Infidels is continued for a con&s;iderable time in enlightened ages, the natural re&s;ult is, a di&s;play of the &s;everal evidences of Chri&s;tianity, and a vindication of it from all objections, more pure and un|mixt, more con&s;i&s;tent, and more uni|formly &s;olid, than could have otherwi&s;e been expected. By the weakne&s;s of hu|man nature, and the partial and di&s;|cordant views of men, this effect will be hindered from taking place all at once. An entire defence of Chri&s;ti|anity again&s;t all kinds of objections, and in re&s;pect of all its evidences, e|qually
<PB N="381" REF="420">
unexceptionable in every part, is a work too large and multifarious for the abilities of mo&s;t men. But there are &s;eparate defences of its &s;everal dif|ferent evidences, each of which is ab|&s;olutely unexceptionable, and all of which put together may form a com|plete and faultle&s;s apology for our re|ligion. Nay, there are general defen|ces of it, con&s;idered in every point of view, as uniformly &s;olid as any work on any &s;ubject of the &s;ame compa&s;s and variety. When we look back, and ob&s;erve how great progre&s;s has been made in this argument within a &s;hort period pa&s;t, a much purer and com|pleter defence of the truth of our reli|gion, than yet exi&s;ts, will not appear too much to be expected from the con|tinuance of the efforts of unbelievers, in an age affording all advantages for every branch of learning, and encou|raging freedom of inquiry. But even
<PB N="382" REF="421">
before the tendency of oppo&s;ition to make all weak rea&s;onings be univer&s;al|ly abandoned, have time to take entire effect, the cen&s;ures of them which it produces, give men of abilities the means of &s;electing for them&s;elves &s;uch proofs as are valid, without a mixture of any others. A man who has not ge|nius enough to invent the &s;tronge&s;t ar|guments on a &s;ubject, yet has often judgment enough to prefer them to the weaker, when both are &s;et before him. It is a great advantage to have a large collection of arguments, and of exceptions again&s;t them, in our view at once: the compari&s;on a&s;&s;i&s;ts our choice, and enables us to reject many things with which we would have been &s;atisfied, if we had not &s;een all.</P>
<P>THE rejection of which we have been treating, is not confined to things ab&s;olutely weak and frivolous; it ex|tends
<PB N="383" REF="422">
to all &s;uch principles and argu|ments, however plau&s;ible or ingenious, as are in any the lea&s;t degree excep|tionable. A man is not always aware of every difficulty affecting either the principles on which he founds his ar|guments, or his rea&s;onings from the&s;e principles: And different men exami|ning a &s;ubject without any knowledge of each others &s;entiments, &s;eldom fail to view it in different lights. From the&s;e cau&s;es it proceeds, that Chri&s;ti|ans, even of the greate&s;t abilities, have explained the &s;everal evidences of their religion, on different principles, and in different ways. The oppo&s;ition of Infidels gives occa&s;ion to a communica|tion of &s;entiments among Chri&s;tians. One enjoys the labours of his predece&s;|&s;ors: he can ob&s;erve to what difficul|ties any of their principles have been liable, and guard again&s;t them; what fallacies have been chargeable on any
<PB N="384" REF="423">
of their rea&s;onings; and either, by &s;et|ting the argument in a more &s;triking light, &s;how them to be imaginary; or, if they be real, correct them. Infidels will canva&s;s the <HI>defects</HI> at lea&s;t, of all the different hypothe&s;es adopted. In con|&s;equence of their eagerne&s;s to take all advantages, Chri&s;tians likewi&s;e will be ready to ob&s;erve them. The blemi&s;hes of each will be gradually di&s;covered, and at length acknowledged; and the argument will be &s;tated in &s;uch a way as to &s;tand clear of them all. This may be exemplified in the two principal e|vidences of our religion. Tho' all Chri|&s;tians agree that the wonderful works a&s;cribed to our Saviour, are properly miracles, yet they have given different definitions of a miracle. Some have a|dopted definitions, which, once admit|ted, render the argument from mira|cles very &s;hort and obvious: others have preferred &s;uch definitions as in|deed
<PB N="385" REF="424">
leave the deduction from them &s;omewhat more intricate, but will be more readily admitted. The ar|gument from miracles, &s;o far as Chri|&s;tianity is concerned, may perhaps be rendered conclu&s;ive on any definition of a miracle, that has the &s;malle&s;t de|gree of propriety. It would be an ad|vantage, however, that &s;ome one un|exceptionable definition were univer|&s;ally received. The oppo&s;ition of Infi|dels leads to a &s;crupulous examination of every one that is offered, and has thus a &s;trong tendency to &s;ugge&s;t a de|finition in all re&s;pects blamele&s;s, and to obtain it &s;o univer&s;al a reception, that only men of a very peculiar ca&s;t of mind &s;hall refu&s;e to adopt it. The writings of Chri&s;tians &s;how, indeed, that they are already brought to agree very generally in every material part of the de&s;cription of a miracle, that they differ only in &s;ome circum&s;tances
<PB N="386" REF="425">
of &s;mall importance. They have &s;o far given up all extremes, that, taking that in which they agree for the notion of a miracle, there is no difficulty in pro|ving, either that our Saviour's works were truly miracles, or that &s;uch mira|cles as his, prove a divine mi&s;&s;ion. In like manner, Chri&s;tians have differed very con&s;iderably in their explications of the prophecies of the Old Te&s;tament, and in the principles on which they &s;how the application of many of them to Je&s;us. Some, conceiving nothing peculiar to the prophetic &s;tile, have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to maintain, that the &s;everal prophecies were intended of him in their &s;ole literal &s;en&s;e; and, in their eagerne&s;s to maintain this, they have &s;tretched particulars, and in|troduced arbitrary &s;uppo&s;itions, and rules of interpretation &s;carce defen&s;i|ble. Others, a&s;cribing peculiar quali|ties to the &s;tile of prophecy, have al|lowed
<PB N="387" REF="426">
that &s;ome of the prophecies re|lating to the age of the Me&s;&s;iah, predict it in an indirect and allegorical man|ner, prefiguring it by other analogous events, &s;peaking of it along with the&s;e, or repre&s;enting it by various types; but they too have &s;ometimes been un|able to build their doctrine on &s;uch principles as might give it entire &s;oli|dity and firmne&s;s. The former have been led to &s;uppo&s;e corruptions with|out evidence, and in&s;tances of incohe|rence without nece&s;&s;ity: the latter have con&s;idered predictions as applicable, in &s;ome degree, to other events, which were intended of the Me&s;&s;iah alone. Infidels have not failed to triumph in the diver&s;ity of &s;uch opinions, and to accumulate again&s;t each of them, all the difficulties to which it was liable. Chri&s;tians too have, without re&s;erve, ex|amined both hypothe&s;es, and endea|voured to find out the truth. In the
<PB N="388" REF="427">
cour&s;e of the examination, the difficul|ty has been in a great mea&s;ure remo|ved. It has appeared that, when men &s;eemed to e&s;pou&s;e the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite principles, they often differed only in words; and that, &s;o far as their differ|ence was real, it proceeded chiefly from their explaining principles ju&s;t in them|&s;elves, in an improper manner, or from their extending them too far. It has been fairly proved, not only that Chri&s;tians apply the ancient prophecies to the &s;ame events, and in the &s;ame way as the Jews applied them before their fulfilment; but al&s;o, that this ap|plication is perfectly agreeable to the natural genius of prophetic writing; that it is reducible to as fix'd general rules as any &s;pecies of critici&s;m whate|ver; that the&s;e rules ari&s;e from princi|ples founded in the nature and de&s;ign of the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation, in the un|que&s;tionable manners and u&s;ages of the
<PB N="389" REF="428">
times when the prophecies were pro|nounced, nay in the very nature of language, and ju&s;tified both by the hi|&s;tory and by the philo&s;ophy of its ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and gradual improvements. In a word, it has been &s;hown, that the interpretation of prophecy is, as much as any thing el&s;e, reducible to a regu|lar and con&s;i&s;tent &s;y&s;tem, built on the mo&s;t rational and &s;olid principles; and that the difficulties with which it &s;eem|ed to be pre&s;&s;ed, aro&s;e only from mens having conceived that &s;y&s;tem imper|fectly, and are therefore chargeable only on the weakne&s;s of individuals, but do not in the lea&s;t dimini&s;h the real force of this evidence of our reli|gion.</P>
<P>WHEN objections are rai&s;ed again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, which &s;eem to be deduced from deep and &s;olid principles, and to be pur&s;ued by clo&s;e rea&s;oning, which
<PB N="390" REF="429">
are therefore very plau&s;ible, and make a great &s;how of &s;trength; the weak are alarmed, as if the truth were in dan|ger of being overthrown. The fear is vain: the&s;e are only the violent rubs which the natural &s;olidity of the dia|mond renders nece&s;&s;ary for giving it its proper lu&s;tre: a much &s;lighter touch would give a &s;ofter &s;tone the highe&s;t poli&s;h of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible, or would perhaps even break it into pieces; but were the diamond tried with weaker friction, it would never di&s;play all its brightne&s;s, nor would it be ever known how &s;olid and how &s;trong it is. When only trivial objections are moved again&s;t a truth, they &s;carce &s;eem to require any an&s;wer at all; at any rate, the an&s;wer is obvious, a &s;mall de|gree of attention is &s;ufficient for re|moving them, and they excite not to a thorough examination of the &s;ubject; when they are confuted, the confuta|tion
<PB N="391" REF="430">
contributes very little to &s;how the &s;trength of the argument again&s;t which they were directed. On the contrary, &s;trong objections cannot be removed without a careful examination of the &s;ubject, without &s;trict attention to the principles from which they are dedu|ced, and accurate knowledge of the &s;ciences to which the&s;e principles be|long: and the view of &s;trong objec|tions leads the mind to give the nece&s;|&s;ary application. But inten&s;e appli|cation of mind be&s;tows uncommon vi|gour on the exerci&s;e of all the faculties, and enables a man to di&s;cover truths, which otherwi&s;e he would never have &s;o much as conjectured. When, there|fore, inten&s;e application of mind, and the invigorated exerci&s;e of under&s;tand|ing thence re&s;ulting, are employed a|bout the evidences of Chri&s;tianity, they naturally produce a di&s;play of the full force of the&s;e evidences, and an inve|&s;tigation
<PB N="392" REF="431">
of the profounde&s;t &s;ources of them. The &s;tronger the objections are, the more &s;trongly they prompt men to the exertion of their powers; and, as &s;oon as they are an&s;wered, the more con&s;picuous the &s;olidity of the eviden|ces of Chri&s;tianity becomes, &s;ince even by &s;o formidable objections they are not overcome. It requires abilities to an&s;wer a &s;trong objection: but to tho&s;e who have the nece&s;&s;ary abilities, a &s;trong objection points out the road which leads to a proper an&s;wer. The cavils of dulne&s;s &s;erve no other purpo&s;e but to perplex a &s;ubject, and involve it in confu&s;ion: but even the errors of true genius give hints of farther di&s;co|veries, by pro&s;ecuting which they may be corrected. This ob&s;ervation might be confirmed by many in&s;tances on all kinds of &s;ubjects: I &s;hall give only one on a &s;ubject nearly allied to the pre&s;ent theme; the theory of evidence.
<PB N="393" REF="432">
The fir&s;t attempts of philo&s;ophers a|mounted to little more than the taking notice of &s;ome of the characters of tho&s;e arguments which in fact produce belief, and of &s;ome of the rules by which &s;uch arguments may be con|&s;tructed. By degrees, a greater variety of conclu&s;ive forms of &s;yllogi&s;ms were pointed out, and the rules for di&s;tin|gui&s;hing the&s;e from mere &s;ophi&s;ms, were rendered more preci&s;e and determinate. At length, genius, di&s;daining to be confined to the mere mechani&s;m of rea|&s;oning, &s;et about inve&s;tigating the ge|neral principles, and the different kinds of evidence. The difficulty of the &s;ubject, joined to an exce&s;&s;ive de|&s;ire of &s;implicity, rendered the fir&s;t attempts imperfect. From their im|perfections, &s;ucceeding philo&s;ophers were led into conclu&s;ions which &s;ub|vert all belief and introduce &s;ceptici&s;m. But the&s;e conclu&s;ions being deduced
<PB N="394" REF="433">
with great ingenuity, their very errors point out in &s;ome mea&s;ure where the fallacy lies, and &s;ugge&s;t the means by which a ju&s;ter theory may be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed. Whatever di&s;coveries there have been on this head, are in a con&s;idera|ble degree owing to the preparation made for them, by the acutene&s;s of tho&s;e who have fallen into capital mi&s;takes, and have been hit upon by only car|rying to a greater length, and pur&s;uing with greater caution, the very method of inve&s;tigation of which they had &s;et an example. In like manner, every objection truly ingenious, urged a|gain&s;t any of the evidences of Chri&s;ti|anity, has always &s;tarted hints, the pro&s;ecution of which leads not only to a &s;atisfying an&s;wer to that particular objection, but al&s;o to a clearer view of the principles from which the &s;trength of tho&s;e evidences ari&s;es. Thus &s;trong objections tend to produce proportion|ably
<PB N="395" REF="434">
&s;trong defences of Chri&s;tianity, both by exciting to an inten&s;er appli|cation, and a more vigorous exertion of under&s;tanding, and by opening a way for deeper di&s;coveries concerning the nature and force of the evidences of that religion. In a&s;cribing this ten|dency to &s;trong objections, we &s;peak the language of experience. Every age, &s;ince the publication of the go&s;pel, has witne&s;&s;ed the truth of it; every new a&s;&s;ault of infidelity has given occa&s;ion to new and &s;tronger defences of Chri|&s;tianity. Mo&s;t of the objections, for example, that have been rai&s;ed again&s;t the credibility of the Chri&s;tian miracles, have only pointed out &s;ome &s;eparate circum&s;tances which &s;eemed to weaken or to de&s;troy part of the po&s;itive proof of their reality. It has indeed been always pretended, that every the mo&s;t frivolous objection &s;ubverted their cre|dibility altogether: but this is mere
<PB N="396" REF="435">
a&s;&s;ertion, in no way ju&s;tified by the real &s;trength of the objections. Mo&s;t of the an&s;wers returned, only &s;howed that the objections had not the weight a&s;cribed to them, that there was &s;uffi|cient evidence, notwith&s;tanding them, of the reality of the Chri&s;tian miracles: and &s;uch an&s;wers were all that the ob|jections required, and all that they na|turally led to. If, on occa&s;ion of them, any of the general principles on which the evidence of the&s;e miracles depends, were pointed out, this was not &s;o much the re&s;ult of the objections urged, as the effect of uncommon penetration in particular men. But &s;ome objec|tions of greater depth have been rai&s;ed again&s;t miracles, and propo&s;ed with more than ordinary acutene&s;s: their incredibility has been deduced from an ingenious theory of evidence, and from this has &s;eemed to derive a con&s;i|derable degree of &s;olidity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume's E&s;&s;ay on Miracles.</NOTE>. This view

of the matter has led naturally to an inve&s;tigation of the foundation of that evidence which belongs to matters of fact; it has led to an examination, whe|ther the evidence of te&s;timony ari&s;es &s;olely from our experience of the vera|city of mankind, or whether te&s;timony is, independent of experience, a natu|ral cau&s;e of belief? it has led to a proof that, &s;ince the latter is the ca&s;e, the credibility of the Chri&s;tian miracles a|ri&s;es from original and unalterable qua|lities of human nature. It is thus not only &s;hown that we mu&s;t give credit to the&s;e miracles, but explained al&s;o to the &s;atisfaction of the mo&s;t inqui&s;itive, whence it ari&s;es that we mu&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Campbell's Di&s;&s;ertation on Miracles, Part 1.</NOTE>.

objections again&s;t them: it has as great advantages above any other kind of vindication of them, as a direct de|mon&s;tration in mathematics has above an indirect one.</P>
<P>It is ordinary for Infidels, to a&s;cribe their objections again&s;t Chri&s;tianity to philo&s;ophy, and to repre&s;ent them as the effects of deep re&s;earches into the &s;ciences. There is &s;ome colour for the pretence; but it is &s;uch as, when tho|roughly examined, will contribute lit|tle to its credit. In the fir&s;t &s;tage of philo&s;ophy, when it contains only the natural hi&s;tory of things, with a few general conclu&s;ions obviou&s;ly ari&s;ing from facts, it falls in with the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, and it will lead phi|lo&s;ophers to judge of the evidences of religion, in the &s;ame way with an or|dinary man of good &s;en&s;e. When men endeavour to rai&s;e philo&s;ophy from this &s;tate of imperfection, and to inve&s;tigate
<PB N="399" REF="438">
more general principles, they will be able to accompli&s;h it only in part, and their conclu&s;ions may contain &s;ome|thing favourable to irreligion, &s;cepti|ci&s;m, and infidelity. But when men pu&s;h their inquiries &s;till farther, ren|der their conclu&s;ions more accurate, and their theory more perfect, philo|&s;ophy lo&s;es every thing of a pernicious tendency; it appears to be altogether friendly to religion, and by the depth and the unexceptionable ju&s;tne&s;s of its principles, it renders its evidence the brighter, and &s;upports it the more powerfully. Some &s;teps of this pro|gre&s;s, as many as are nece&s;&s;ary for &s;howing it to be natural, may be ob|&s;erved in every part of philo&s;ophy: and in tho&s;e parts of it, which have al|ready arrived at a con&s;iderable degree of perfection, natural philo&s;ophy for in&s;tance, this whole progre&s;s has been exemplified. To every per&s;on who
<PB N="400" REF="439">
examines them, it will appear that tho&s;e objections of ancient Infidels, and even of unbelievers of the la&s;t age, which &s;eemed to have the deepe&s;t foun|dation in philo&s;ophy, were built only on &s;ome fal&s;e or imperfect &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy, which has been exploded in con&s;equence of new di&s;coveries in the &s;ciences. The pre&s;ent race of In|fidels boa&s;t much of their <HI>philo&s;ophic &s;pi|rit,</HI> and to it a&s;cribe all their oppo&s;ition to the go&s;pel: but if their objections truly ari&s;e from philo&s;ophy in the &s;tate in which it now is, it is only becau&s;e it is hitherto in an imperfect &s;tate; a ve|ry few improvements in the &s;ciences will &s;how, that unbelievers either po&s;|&s;e&s;s the philo&s;ophic &s;pirit only in a &s;u|perficial degree, or are perverted by fal&s;e and crude theories; and that, in order to their perceiving the truth of Chri&s;tianity, they need no more but to correct their errors in the &s;ciences,
<PB N="401" REF="440">
and penetrate deeper into the princi|ples of true philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>THE oppo&s;ition of Infidels not only produces a full di&s;play of the leading evidences of the go&s;pel, and a thorough inve&s;tigation of the principles from which they derive their force; but al&s;o leads Chri&s;tians to di&s;cover additional pre&s;umptions and collateral proofs of the truth of their religion. Our Sa|viour and his apo&s;tles profe&s;&s;edly urged only the mo&s;t direct evidences of the go&s;pel. There are many particulars in its &s;tructure, and many circum&s;tan|ces attending it, which truly indicate its divinity, but which are not applied to the confirmation of it, in the New Te&s;tament. It only &s;upplies the ma|terials from which &s;uch arguments may be collected by reflection; it only &s;ug|ge&s;ts the topics from which &s;uch pre|&s;umptions may be deduced. The op|po&s;ition
<PB N="402" REF="441">
of Infidels has contributed greatly to make Chri&s;tians attentive to every thing of this kind, and has led them to pro&s;ecute many collateral proofs of Chri&s;tianity, with great di|&s;tinctne&s;s and energy. It forces Chri|&s;tians to &s;tudy every part of their reli|gion carefully, that they may defend it again&s;t the objections of its enemies: and when they &s;urvey it on every &s;ide, and view it in every light, they di&s;co|ver many &s;trong indications of its divi|nity, which undeniably belong indeed to Chri&s;tianity, but might for ever have e&s;caped their notice, if they had not been rou&s;ed by oppo&s;ition, to extraor|dinary accuracy in examining it. Be|&s;ides, there are many things which have at fir&s;t &s;ight the appearance of ob|jections again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, but which, when they are thoroughly examined, turn out very &s;trong pre&s;umptions of its truth. Infidels, taking the&s;e in the
<PB N="403" REF="442">
mo&s;t obvious point of view, have often urged them as formidable objections: this has excited Chri&s;tians to &s;earch deeper into them, and, by pur&s;uing them through their remoter con&s;e|quences, to &s;how that they are real confirmations of the go&s;pel. Further, when one pre&s;umptive argument for Chri&s;tianity, is di&s;covered, the pro&s;e|cution of it often naturally &s;ugge&s;ts o|thers; as one improvement in any &s;ci|ence generally opens a way for new improvements. Should the oppo&s;ition of Infidels cea&s;e for ever, the additions which they have long ago been the oc|ca&s;ions of making to the proofs of Chri|&s;tianity, will gradually lead forward to the view of many other confirmations of its truth. Very early apologies for the Chri&s;tian religion, afford in&s;tances of collateral arguments for its truth, &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;uch means. Later wri|ters have pointed out &s;everal evidences
<PB N="404" REF="443">
of the &s;ame &s;ort, which ari&s;e from cir|cum&s;tances e&s;&s;ential to the Chri&s;tian re|ligion, or implied in the &s;cripture hi|&s;tory, and which greatly corroborate the direct and principal evidences of the go&s;pel. The&s;e had not appeared at all, or had appeared but faintly to the ancient apologi&s;ts, on the &s;lighter attention which the feebler efforts of the old unbelievers awakened in them: but the repeated and invigorated at|tacks of modern Infidels have excited attention &s;ufficient for the di&s;covery of them, and have even in many in&s;tances &s;ugge&s;ted them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To give a few in&s;tances; of this kind are the arguments pro&s;ecuted in <HI>Ob&s;ervations on the Conver&s;ion and Apo&s;tle&s;hip of St Paul,</HI> in <HI>Duchal's Sermons on Pre&s;umptive arguments for the truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> in <HI>Bell's Enquiry into the divine mi&s;&s;ions of John the Bapti&s;t and Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Several arguments of the &s;ame kind are incidentally introduced into <HI>Warburton's Divine Legation of Mo&s;es.</HI></NOTE>. There are, no doubt, many circum&s;tances of this &s;ort, which have not even yet been profe&s;|&s;edly urged; the longer and the more
<PB N="405" REF="444">
minutely Chri&s;tianity is canva&s;&s;ed, the more indications of divinity, it will be found to contain. But, as the matter &s;tands already, there is not one of its principal evidences which has not been &s;hown to be &s;upported and confirmed by collateral pre&s;umptions. This is of very con&s;iderable moment. The e|vidence of Chri&s;tianity is of the proba|ble kind; and in every probable argu|ment, the &s;trength of the evidence de|pends not only on the &s;trength of each &s;eparate probability, but al&s;o on the number of probabilities. Any new pre&s;umption makes an addition to the evidence, often a greater addition than in proportion to its own force, by fal|ling in with the others, and compleat|ing a connected train of circum&s;tances. Nay, there are in&s;tances in which the want of a &s;ingle circum&s;tance, &s;eeming|ly of no great importance by it&s;elf, would de&s;troy the whole evidence, by
<PB N="406" REF="445">
breaking one link in the chain. But pre&s;umptions, each of which alone is very weak, may, by being numerous and by tallying exactly with one an|other, compo&s;e a proof who&s;e force is irre&s;i&s;tible, and which begets the high|e&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree of conviction, the firme&s;t and the mo&s;t indubitable a&s;&s;u|rance. Let the &s;everal direct eviden|ces of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, together with all the additional pre&s;umptions by which it has been &s;hown that each of them is corroborated, be attentively con&s;idered in their natural order and dependence; and then let impartiality pronounce, whether the proof of Chri|&s;tianity is not indubitable and irre&s;i&s;ti|ble.</P>
<P>IT de&s;erves to be mentioned, that the oppo&s;ition of Infidels produces an effect which makes &s;ome real addition to the original evidence of Chri&s;tianity:
<PB N="407" REF="446">
it gives Chri&s;tians an opportunity of bearing te&s;timony to their religion. The profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, when it meets with no oppo&s;ition either by force or by argument, can &s;carce be regarded as bearing te&s;timony to it. It may be only an indolent acquie&s;cence in the principles which education has in&s;tilled, an unthinking a&s;&s;ent to the e|&s;tabli&s;hed faith, or an implicit compli|ance with the fa&s;hion of the times. But to adhere to Chri&s;tianity in the face of per&s;ecution, to per&s;i&s;t in the belief, or undertake the defence of it, when at|tempts are made to &s;ubvert it by rea|&s;oning, is an authentic te&s;timony of our firm per&s;ua&s;ion of its divinity. Mere authority of fallible men, is far from being a &s;ufficient ground for our be|lieving any doctrine: yet experience &s;hows that it has &s;ome force, and rea|&s;on allows that it ought to have &s;ome force. All men, even they who mo&s;t
<PB N="408" REF="447">
expre&s;sly di&s;claim regard to authority, are ready to value them&s;elves on great names who have held the &s;ame opinions with them&s;elves. They are con&s;cious that the authority of &s;uch names adds &s;ome credit to their own tenets; and therefore they eagerly &s;eize every han|dle for repre&s;enting men of eminence, as of their party. Infidels them&s;elves are not aver&s;e from this: they never mi&s;s an opportunity of filling their works with quotations from &s;uch Chri|&s;tian writers as have advanced any &s;en|timents or principles which they think may be turned to the advantage of their cau&s;e; they boa&s;t of the concurrence of the&s;e in their opinions: on very &s;lender pretences, they have often laid claim to per&s;ons who were by no means unbelivers. In every ca&s;e, when we have communicated our opinions to others, and found them approved by them, we thence acquire additional
<PB N="409" REF="448">
a&s;&s;urance of their truth. There mu&s;t be a real foundation in human nature for a deference to authority, which is &s;o &s;trictly univer&s;al. Regard to autho|rity may very readily become exce&s;|&s;ive, it often does: but when it is not exce&s;&s;ive, when it is moderate and du|ly regulated, it is a natural and rea|&s;onable foundation for &s;ome degree of a&s;&s;ent. When a per&s;on of abilities, one e&s;pecially who is remarkable for ju&s;t rea&s;oning, has examined an opinion carefully, and after examination holds it, this gives a pre&s;umption that he found it fully proved; we immediately conclude that, if there had been any defect in its evidence, his acutene&s;s would have very probably enabled him to di&s;cover it. This alone is far from being a full proof of the truth of an o|pinion: but it affords a real, frequent|ly a &s;trong, probability for its truth. It may be &s;et a&s;ide or overbalanced in
<PB N="410" REF="449">
many different ways: but it is a real pre&s;umption which, till it be actually de&s;troyed, ought to have &s;ome degree of weight with every man. When it is joined to other evidences, it always makes &s;ome addition to their force. Suppo&s;e a man to have fairly examined the evidences of Chri&s;tianity, accord|ing to the be&s;t of his abilities, and in con&s;equence of that examination to be|lieve it; when he finds that great num|bers of per&s;ons, many of them men of the highe&s;t abilities, have likewi&s;e be|lieved it, and given te&s;timony to it, this will produce, at lea&s;t, greater con|fidence in his own judgment, and make him le&s;s &s;u&s;picious that he may po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;taken; it will by the&s;e means contribute to &s;trengthen his faith.</P>
<P>THE brightne&s;s with which the evi|dence of the Chri&s;tian religion &s;hines, will always bear a proportion to the
<PB N="411" REF="450">
purity in which that religion is pre|&s;erved. It may be &s;o much corrupted, that the compounded, adulterated form which a&s;&s;umes the name of Chri&s;tiani|ty, cannot be defended. Chri&s;tians have in many in&s;tances loaded their religion with ab&s;urdities to which rea|&s;on cannot be reconciled, and which, by being confounded with the go&s;pel, ob&s;cure its evidence. Corruptions of Chri&s;tianity &s;tain its evidence, as it were, with a dim varni&s;h, which is of the more dangerous con&s;equence, be|cau&s;e it is not &s;u&s;pected to be a var|ni&s;h, but mi&s;taken for the genuine co|lour, and even reckoned by &s;ome the mo&s;t beautiful part of the Chri&s;tian &s;y|&s;tem. The oppo&s;ition of Infidels has a tendency to prevent the corruption of Chri&s;tianity, and to lead Chri&s;tians to reject by degrees all &s;uch adulterations as have already been admitted. It was after Chri&s;tianity had been pretty much
<PB N="412" REF="451">
e&s;tabli&s;hed, it was when the profe&s;&s;ors of it were little expo&s;ed to the ob&s;erva|tion of Pagans, or to oppo&s;ition from them, that the corruptions of Popery invaded the church: it was in ages of darkne&s;s and ignorance, when every thing pa&s;&s;ed without examination, when the greate&s;t ab&s;urdities met with no oppo&s;ition, that the&s;e corruptions grew to a height. Oppo&s;ition from Infidels would have naturally checked their progre&s;s, or even prevented their ap|pearance altogether. Had Chri&s;tians continued, for in&s;tance, as they were at fir&s;t, to be intermixed with Pagans, had they continued to have frequent occa&s;ions of repre&s;enting to them the ab&s;urdity of making images of their gods, or of wor&s;hipping tho&s;e who had once, by their own confe&s;&s;ion, been mortal men; this mu&s;t have pre&s;erved &s;o con&s;tant a &s;en&s;e of the truth in their minds, as could not have failed to re|&s;train
<PB N="413" REF="452">
them from ever thinking of in|troducing the wor&s;hip of images and of &s;aints; or, if they could have been &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent as to attempt it, the Pa|gans would have retorted their own ar|guments upon them, and made them to perceive very quickly the ab&s;urdity of the attempt. Every per&s;on who is at all acquainted with the &s;ubject, knows that Infidels have derived their mo&s;t plau&s;ible objections again&s;t the excel|lence and utility of the go&s;pel, from the corruptions with which Chri&s;tiani|ty is blended in the Popi&s;h religion, and from the remains of the tenets and &s;pirit thence ari&s;ing, which &s;till adhere to many Prote&s;tants. The&s;e have given them an occa&s;ion to repre|&s;ent the go&s;pel, as a di&s;putatious &s;y|&s;tem of dry, &s;peculative, intricate, ab|&s;tru&s;e opinions; as promoting a &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;tition as irrational and abject as any that was ever cheri&s;hed by any
<PB N="414" REF="453">
&s;pecies of Pagani&s;m; as giving coun|tenance to prie&s;t-craft and u&s;urpation over the con&s;ciences of men: in a word, have given them an occa&s;ion to affirm, that the go&s;pel has been productive of no advantages to mankind, that, on the contrary, it has been on the whole per|nicious. Taking it for granted, that every thing belongs to Chri&s;tianity, which has been at any time maintain|ed by any number of Chri&s;tians, Infi|dels have repre&s;ented its internal evi|dence as nothing, nay have repre&s;ented it as containing many things which it requires great pains to ju&s;tify, and which it would need very &s;trong argu|ments for proving to have been reveal|ed by God. By means of this, and likewi&s;e by pretending evidences for the &s;uperadditions to Chri&s;tianity, &s;i|milar to tho&s;e which were exhibited for Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, the corrupters of the go&s;pel have given unbelievers a pre|tence
<PB N="415" REF="454">
for making large deductions from the force even of its external evidences. When Infidels lay hold of the&s;e advan|tages in their oppo&s;ition to the go&s;pel, this has a &s;trong tendency to pu&s;h Chri&s;tians forward in reforming their religion from all corruptions. When we find plau&s;ible or &s;trong objections rai&s;ed again&s;t what has been at any time reckoned a part of Chri&s;tianity, when we can &s;carce give a rational and &s;atisfying defence of it, it is natural to examine carefully, whether this be tru|ly a part of the original go&s;pel, or only an addition to it. Many of tho&s;e arti|cles again&s;t which Infidels have erected their &s;tronge&s;t batteries, and which they have attacked with the faire&s;t pro|&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, have appeared, on exa|mination, to be of the latter kind, and have been very generally abandoned. By many cau&s;es, the complete refor|mation of our religion from all corrup|tions,
<PB N="416" REF="455">
may be retarded for a con&s;ider|able time: but nothing can counteract the influence of tho&s;e cau&s;es more &s;trong|ly, than continued oppo&s;ition from un|believers. This has a tendency to u|nite all true Chri&s;tians in the de&s;ire of putting their religion in the be&s;t &s;tate of defence again&s;t the common enemy, to make them concur in giving up all opinions and practices which do not undeniably belong to the go&s;pel. By the&s;e means, Chri&s;tianity will be gra|dually brought back to its original pu|rity and &s;implicity: in &s;ome periods, the advances may be &s;low; in &s;ome, they may be interrupted; but as long as Infidels are eager to turn the private &s;entiments of individuals, and the over|&s;trained tenets of parties, to the di&s;cre|dit of the go&s;pel, there will be &s;ome tendency to return by degrees to the unadulterated religion of Je&s;us. Pure notions of Chri&s;tianity, once introdu|ced,
<PB N="417" REF="456">
will naturally diffu&s;e them&s;elves. They will by degrees recommend them&s;elves &s;o generally, that all Chri|&s;tians mu&s;t in time imbibe &s;omewhat of the &s;pirit which they rai&s;e. Even Popery has become con&s;iderably dif|ferent from what it once was, and it would have been &s;till more reformed, if artificial and political re&s;traints had not oppo&s;ed the tendency of examina|tion and inquiry. Since Chri&s;tianity began to be depraved by adventitious mixtures, there never was an age in which there has appeared &s;o generally, as in the pre&s;ent, a di&s;po&s;ition to embrace whatever fair inquiry di&s;covered to be the real doctrine of &s;cripture, without any regard to the authority of men, or to the e&s;tabli&s;hed di&s;tinctions of &s;ects: and nowhere has this liberal &s;pirit pre|vailed &s;o much as in tho&s;e countries in which infidelity has been &s;uffered, for the longe&s;t &s;pace of time, to propo&s;e
<PB N="418" REF="457">
all its objections freely, and without the fear of per&s;ecution or legal penalties. But the effect of its oppo&s;ition has hi|therto taken place only in part. The heart of a good man triumphs in con|ceiving the period when it &s;hall have fully taken place; in anticipating the time when Chri&s;tianity &s;hall become in the writings and in the apprehen&s;ions of Chri&s;tians, as it truly is in the New Te&s;tament, not a &s;y&s;tem of nice &s;pecu|lations and contentious &s;ubleties, but a &s;eries of plain principles, evidently founded in &s;cripture, unmixt with the arbitrary explications, and precarious conclu&s;ions of fallible men, all natural|ly touching the heart, commanding congruous affections, and, by their joint force, directly inculcating piety and vir|tue, and promoting the reformation and happine&s;s of mankind. Let the Chri&s;tian religion be univer&s;ally and &s;teadily kept in this point of view by
<PB N="419" REF="458">
Chri&s;tians: then it will appear that the mo&s;t formidable objections of Infi|dels have been directed, not again&s;t this religion it&s;elf, but again&s;t &s;ome|thing totally different, tho' unhappily confounded with it; then the excel|lence of Chri&s;tianity will &s;hine con&s;pi|cuous and indi&s;putable; then all its e|vidences will operate on the under|&s;tanding with their full force; then its truth will be &s;trikingly perceived, like the beauty of a fine picture placed in a proper light: Then too Chri&s;tianity will have its native influence on the temper and practice of mankind; it will be a vital principle of real good|ne&s;s. Virtue and joy, its amiable chil|dren, will &s;tand up, and declare with a voice of irre&s;i&s;tible per&s;ua&s;ion, that it is of heavenly extraction, that it is truly the offspring of the Mo&s;t High. Every man who is actuated by the go&s;pel, will feel its truth from his own expe|rience

of its efficacy, and will have <HI>the witne&s;s in him&s;elf</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 10.</NOTE>, that it is <HI>the word of God,</HI> the <HI>incorruptible &s;eed</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 1. 23.</NOTE> of holine&s;s and felicity. All men will &s;ee with their eyes &s;uch marks of its power, as cannot &s;uffer them to doubt of its truth and divinity. How glorious a te&s;timo|ny would this &s;tate of things give to our religion! What &s;plendor would it confer upon its evidences! The go|&s;pel maintained in its purity, and vigo|rou&s;ly conceived, tends to produce this &s;tate of things: And the vigilance and oppo&s;ition of Infidels is one very pow|erful mean of exciting Chri&s;tians to maintain the go&s;pel in its purity.</P>
<P>SUCH are the advantages ari&s;ing to Chri&s;tianity from tho&s;e objections by which Infidels intended to &s;ubvert it. The force of its evidences has been pointed out and a&s;certained; every exception again&s;t them has been exa|mined,

and &s;hown to be groundle&s;s; the proofs of its divinity have been fully illu&s;trated, and &s;et in a variety of &s;triking lights; trivial or que&s;tionable arguments have been by degrees aban|doned; &s;eemingly jarring arguments have been explained with greater pre|ci&s;ion, and by &s;uch explication recon|ciled; the &s;tronge&s;t objections have on|ly produced a deeper and more &s;atisfy|ing inve&s;tigation of the principles from which the evidences of Chri&s;tianity de|rive their force; the defence of this re|ligion has been rendered in a great mea&s;ure pure, con&s;i&s;tent, and uniform|ly &s;olid; many collateral proofs of it have been attended to and pro&s;ecuted; Chri&s;tians have been led to the mo&s;t ex|plicit declarations of their belief of it; and they have been excited to avoid or to remove tho&s;e corruptions which would eclip&s;e the &s;plendor of its evi|dence.

<P>THERE is, however, an objection which &s;eems to ari&s;e from matter of fact. The continuance and the growth of infidelity proves, it may be thought, either that the evidence of Chri&s;tianity is not brought, by the oppo&s;ition of Infidels, into the &s;tate which we have &s;uppo&s;ed, or that its being brought into that &s;tate, is not an advantage upon the whole. But it really proves neither. It is not my de&s;ign to exa|mine
<PB N="423" REF="462">
all the cau&s;es of the ri&s;e or of the growth of infidelity: but it will not be pretended that <HI>all</HI> Infidels become &s;uch, on a deliberate inquiry into all the rea|&s;onings for and again&s;t Chri&s;tianity. Infidels them&s;elves di&s;claim this as a drudgery, too mean for their great abi|lities: they boa&s;t of having di&s;covered a &s;horter way to truth; and the wri|tings of mo&s;t of them demon&s;trate, that they have &s;pared them&s;elves the pains of be&s;towing any attention on the defences of Chri&s;tianity. From their opinion, then, no conclu&s;ion can be drawn concerning the &s;tate in which the controver&s;y really &s;tands. What that &s;tate is, they cannot po&s;&s;ibly know, who have never inquired into it. Tho' every argument for Chri&s;tianity were rendered irre&s;i&s;tible, and every objec|tion again&s;t it fully confuted, the&s;e can thence derive no advantage. The clear|e&s;t illu&s;tration of the evidences of this
<PB N="424" REF="463">
religion, cannot prevent infidelity from &s;preading among tho&s;e who are not determined by evidence, but led by fa&s;hion, or an affected &s;uperiority to vulgar belief, or who take up with any &s;pecious argument upon one &s;ide. That the infidelity of &s;ome &s;hould lead others into infidelity, is by no means &s;urpri|&s;ing: that it &s;hould, and yet the ef|forts of infidelity have as great a ten|dency as we have a&s;cribed to them, to add &s;trength to the evidences of the go&s;pel, is far from being marvellous. Almo&s;t every thing produces mixt ef|fects. That will &s;educe the thought|le&s;s, the prejudiced, and the vicious, which contributes powerfully to the confirmation of the hone&s;t and con&s;i|derate. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t obvious ef|fects may often be of the pernicious kind; and yet, if time be allowed, the con&s;equences may be on the whole highly beneficial. An age or two
<PB N="425" REF="464">
appears very con&s;iderable to us, but it is not con&s;iderable in the eye of God: for many ages he permitted rude|ne&s;s and idolatry to prevail among all the nations; and, in many nations, it &s;till continues to prevail. Need we won|der, then, that he has permitted infide|lity to grow &s;o long as it has yet grown, or that he &s;hould even &s;uffer it to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t much longer and to &s;pread much wider? or can we thence conclude, that it will be in the end triumphant? All the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence are progre&s;&s;ive; they are often un|folded by very &s;low degrees; from their appearance for an age or two, we cannot determine what will be the fi|nal i&s;&s;ue. All the oppo&s;ition of Infidels to Chri&s;tianity, has been un&s;ucce&s;sful; their objections have been an&s;wered; every new attempt has only afforded a new proof of their weakne&s;s: they are ob&s;tinate enough to repeat their at|tempts
<PB N="426" REF="465">
with hopes of better &s;ucce&s;s, and they who take not the pains to learn how often and how &s;hamefully they have been baffled, reckon their ob&s;tinacy the effect of victory, and are &s;educed to their party: but the natural con&s;equence is, that infidelity &s;hould cea&s;e at la&s;t, and the truth of Chri&s;tian|ity be acknowledged by all. An ene|my may be&s;iege a fortre&s;s that is in truth impregnable, tho' he has former|ly met with a repul&s;e; he may for a long time entertain the hope of making an impre&s;&s;ion on &s;ome quarter or an|other: much more may <HI>they</HI> renew the &s;iege, who have not been informed of the defeats of other a&s;&s;ailants: but cer|tainly the direct tendency of frequent repul&s;es is, to convince all of the folly of the enterpri&s;e, and to make the &s;trength of the place to be confe&s;&s;ed; if in every a&s;&s;ault it be found impreg|nable, this will at la&s;t be the actual ef|fect.
<PB N="427" REF="466">
It is in many ca&s;es impo&s;&s;ible to convince a man, tho' you render it plain that he ought to have been con|vinced. The be&s;t defence of Chri&s;ti|anity will not infallibly produce belief in every man; it is enough that it be defended in &s;uch a way as to &s;how, that they are unrea&s;onable who di&s;be|lieve it.

<HEAD>The advantages which CHRISTIANITY has derived from OPPOSITION,
afford a &s;eparate argument for its truth.</HEAD>
<P>IT has now been &s;hown, that all the rea&s;onings of Infidels, have been &s;o far from overturning the Chri&s;tian re|ligion, that they have contributed to throw new light on its evidences, to make the &s;olidity and &s;trength of each of them to be more clearly perceived, and to lead to the di&s;covery of many collateral arguments for the divine ori|ginal of the go&s;pel. Tho' no general conclu&s;ion could be drawn from the induction of particulars, which we have attempted, the attempt would have
<PB N="430" REF="469">
neverthele&s;s been worth our labour. Every &s;tep of it &s;ets the evidences of the go&s;pel in &s;ome point of view which gives &s;atisfaction to the under&s;tanding, additional to what it receives from the mere propo&s;al of the evidences them|&s;elves. If attention to the&s;e evidences has produced belief, ob&s;ervation of any one of the effects of oppo&s;ition, will naturally convince us that we had rea|&s;on to believe, and will by this reflec|tion confirm our faith. But the detail which we have made, an&s;wers a farther purpo&s;e. The &s;everal advantages enu|merated, may be collected into one point; they form premi&s;&s;es from which the truth of Chri&s;tianity may be direct|ly inferred. This fact, that the oppo|&s;ition of Infidels, in&s;tead of overturning Chri&s;tianity, has greatly confirmed it, and, in the &s;everal ways taken notice of, been the occa&s;ion of illu&s;trating its evidences, affords a new pre&s;umption,
<PB N="431" REF="470">
a &s;eparate and &s;trong proof of its divi|nity.</P>
<P>INFIDELS have &s;ometimes drawn the oppo&s;ite conclu&s;ion, from the multi|tude of objections which have been rai&s;ed again&s;t the truth of Chri&s;tianity, and from the labour of argument which has been employed in vindicating it from the&s;e objections: they have inti|mated, that, if its evidences had been entirely clear and &s;olid, they would not have afforded &s;cope for this. Their conclu&s;ion &s;uppo&s;es, that certain and evident truths will never be called in que&s;tion. But no &s;uppo&s;ition can be fal&s;er. The mo&s;t evident truths are tho&s;e again&s;t which &s;ceptics are gene|rally mo&s;t eager to direct their cavils. They think, perhaps, that the le&s;s a principle is liable to objections, the greater ingenuity it &s;hows to find out objections again&s;t it. But whatever be
<PB N="432" REF="471">
the motive, experience proves the fact. The principles of common &s;en&s;e, for in&s;tance, are ab&s;olutely undeniable; they extort the a&s;&s;ent of every per&s;on; they have &s;o deep a foundation in the original con&s;titution of our nature, that no man could ever &s;eriou&s;ly doubt of them. But this has not pre&s;erved them from oppo&s;ition: &s;ome have invented very &s;ubtle arguments for proving that we ought to doubt of them; and the&s;e cannot be confuted without great in|genuity, and copious rea&s;onings. Ob|jections have been urged again&s;t the demon&s;trations, and even again&s;t the axioms of geometry; it requires con&s;i|derable attention and pains to an&s;wer them: but, &s;ince they may be fully an&s;wered, they cannot ju&s;tly lead us to call in que&s;tion the force either of demon&s;trative or of intuitive evidence: they may confound a per&s;on who does not readily perceive the fallacy of
<PB N="433" REF="472">
them; but if a &s;elf-evident truth or a &s;trict demon&s;tration be propo&s;ed to him, they cannot prevent his being convinced. There is no &s;ubject on which doubts and difficulties may not be &s;tarted by ingenious and di&s;puta|tious men: and therefore, from the number of their objections, and the length of the controver&s;y to which they give occa&s;ion, we cannot in any ca&s;e conclude, that the original evidence is weak, or even that it is not obvious and &s;triking. Were we to pre&s;ume that every principle is dubious, again&s;t which &s;pecious objections may be con|trived, we &s;hould be quickly led into univer&s;al &s;ceptici&s;m. The two ways in which the ingenuity of &s;peculative men has been mo&s;t commonly employ|ed, are dogmatical a&s;&s;ertions of doubt|ful opinions, and &s;ubtle cavils again&s;t certain truths. It is therefore ab&s;olute|ly unrea&s;onable to conceive any &s;u&s;pi|cion
<PB N="434" REF="473">
unfavourable to the truth of Chri|&s;tianity, merely on account of the mul|tiplied rea&s;onings of captious men a|gain&s;t its evidences, and the various and large defences of it, to which the&s;e have given occa&s;ion. No degree of &s;trength or clearne&s;s can prevent ob|jections from being framed; when they are framed, &s;olutions become nece&s;&s;a|ry: they are nece&s;&s;ary only for remo|ving the cavils of unbelievers, not for enabling the unprejudiced to perceive the force of the original evidences. That many objections have been ur|ged, and that the an&s;wers have in|crea&s;ed in proportion, and been &s;ome|times conducted with great &s;ubtlety, is no pre&s;umption of the fal&s;ity of Chri|&s;tianity: if the objections have been &s;hown to be in conclu&s;ive, if the an&s;wers have evinced the &s;olidity and &s;trength of the evidences of the go&s;pel, this is &s;ufficient for putting the truth of
<PB N="435" REF="474">
Chri&s;tianity beyond all rea&s;onable doubt.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of Chri&s;tianity, Gamaliel, uncertain whether it came from God or not, referred the deter|mination to this very trial. When the Jewi&s;h council wanted to put the apo|&s;tles to death, he &s;aid, <HI>Refrain from the&s;e men, and let them alone: for if this coun&s;el or this work be of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot over|throw it</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts v. 38, 39.</NOTE>. The judgment was &s;olid; it was founded on the nature of truth: Chri&s;tianity has undergone the trial, and &s;hown it&s;elf to be divine. We may now determine with the greate&s;t confidence; <HI>This coun&s;el and this work</HI> has not <HI>come to nought,</HI> tho' the mo&s;t eager endeavours to bring it to nought, have been repeatedly employed; therefore it is not <HI>of men:</HI> men have not been a|ble by the utmo&s;t efforts of argument
<PB N="436" REF="475">
to <HI>overthrow it,</HI> all their efforts have, on the contrary, confirmed it; there|fore it is <HI>of God.</HI> The force of this proof of the divinity of our religion, will ap|pear from the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The evidences of Chri&s;tianity can|not properly be rendered &s;tronger in them&s;elves, by means of the oppo&s;ition of Infidels, than they originally were. They were from the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the &s;trength which the mo&s;t thorough examination di&s;covers in them; it is their having been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, that renders them capable of bearing a tho|rough examination. Examination does not create any part of their &s;trength, but it greatly di&s;plays it. Evidence can an&s;wer no purpo&s;e except it be per|ceived; it cannot operate with its full force, except its force be perfectly un|der&s;tood: the oppo&s;ition of Infidels gives a clearer conception and firmer a&s;&s;urance of the &s;ufficiency of the evi|dence which Chri&s;tianity had from the
<PB N="437" REF="476">
beginning, than could have been other|wi&s;e obtained. Thus, tho' gold be as truly gold before it is tried as after|wards, yet when it has undergone eve|ry &s;ort of trial, and in each of them di&s;played the characteri&s;tics of that me|tal, its purity becomes more evident and certain than it was. If a fortifi|cation be found impregnable on a &s;iege, it truly was impregnable before; but it is its having &s;u&s;tained the &s;iege, that di&s;covers its having been &s;uch.</P>
<P>Indeed there cannot be an higher or a more undeniable proof of the truth of any principle or &s;y&s;tem, than this, that it has not been di&s;proved by &s;e|vere and repeated examinations. In many ca&s;es, the evidence may be &s;o full, and the proof &s;o clear and deci|&s;ive, that the very fir&s;t time &s;ufficient attention is be&s;towed, there remains no rational ground of doubt. If the fir&s;t examination, however, &s;hould leave a &s;u&s;picion of any fallacy, what
<PB N="438" REF="477">
method could we naturally take for determining, whether the &s;u&s;picion be ju&s;t or groundle&s;s, but to examine the proof anew? If, after reiterated exa|minations, it &s;till appeared to be unex|ceptionable, our a&s;&s;urance of the truth of the conclu&s;ion would nece&s;&s;arily be|come much firmer. Tho' its e&s;&s;ential evidence continues the &s;ame, yet the effect of that evidence on our under|&s;tanding, is heightened by every exa|mination. If we moreover &s;et our|&s;elves to find out all the difficulties which attend the evidence, and all the exceptions which can be taken again&s;t it, if we learned from tho&s;e who re|ject it, all the grounds of their unbe|lief; and if, after all this, we &s;till found the evidence &s;atisfying and con|clu&s;ive, and could di&s;cern no real fal|lacy in any part of it, this would rai&s;e our a&s;&s;urance to a height which no|thing can exceed. There are many
<PB N="439" REF="478">
ca&s;es in which we have not all the op|portunities, and many more in which we take not all the pains, nece&s;&s;ary for obtaining this high degree of a&s;&s;urance concerning the truth of our principles. This is the rea&s;on why men of ha&s;ty judgments, hold &s;o many doubtful or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">al&s;e opinions, and why we have no|thing but opinion on &s;ubjects where we might have certainty. But the e|vidences of Chri&s;tianity have &s;tood the te&s;t of a &s;everer examination than ever was be&s;towed on any other &s;ubject. Every difficulty has been repre&s;ented in the &s;tronge&s;t colouring, every ob|jection urged, all the evidences can|va&s;&s;ed if po&s;&s;ibly there could be found a fallacy in any part of them; their &s;trength has been tried by one after another, and tried in every po&s;&s;ible way: but after all, the evidences of our religion appear to be &s;ound, and &s;atisfying, as high as the nature of the
<PB N="440" REF="479">
&s;ubject can admit, as high as could be expected on &s;uppo&s;ition of its truth. When they are &s;imply propo&s;ed, they are convincing to the unprejudiced mind: when all that can be advanced again&s;t them, and all that can be ur|ged in &s;upport of them, are fairly ba|lanced, &s;till they are convincing. This gives new a&s;&s;urance of their &s;trength; no per&s;on who enquires, and finds on enquiry that this is the ca&s;e, can entertain a doubt of it. There can be no more certain mark for di&s;tingui&s;hing between truth and fal&s;e|hood than this, that the former with|&s;tands all the a&s;&s;aults of rea&s;oning, but the latter, tho' it may maintain it&s;elf by &s;pecious pleas for a while, yet never fails to be plainly detected and confu|ted, if the &s;crutiny be long continued. By this mark, the go&s;pel is proved to be truth. If it were not truth, is it po&s;|&s;ible, that all the efforts of early unbe|lievers,
<PB N="441" REF="480">
in&s;tead of detecting any impo|&s;ture, &s;hould have produced only fri|volous objections, added &s;trength to its &s;everal evidences, and laid a foun|dation for new proofs of its divinity? Is it po&s;&s;ible that Infidels, in every age, &s;hould have been driven to all the me|thods of chicane and &s;ophi&s;try in mana|ging their oppo&s;ition to the go&s;pel? Is it po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould have been able to di&s;cover only &s;uch arguments again&s;t it, as are for the mo&s;t part weak or unfair, as without exception lo&s;e their plau&s;ibility, in proportion to the attention with which they are exami|ned, and have been fully an&s;wered?</P>
<P>If it could be a&s;&s;erted, merely that Chri&s;tianity has &s;tood the trial without being confuted, this would be &s;uffici|ent to infer its truth: but by the trial, its evidence has been illu&s;trated, and has received an acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength; this renders its truth &s;till more undeni|able.
<PB N="442" REF="481">
There may be <HI>fal&s;e</HI> principles which we cannot ab&s;olutely confute; we may want the means of proving that they are certainly fal&s;e: but there can|not be a fal&s;e principle of who&s;e fal&s;e|hood, examination frequently repeated and eagerly pro&s;ecuted, will not infu&s;e a rea&s;onable or probable &s;u&s;picion. Ex|amination generally produces &s;everal &s;ubordinate effects before it i&s;&s;ues in a full confutation: it fir&s;t di&s;covers that &s;ome part of the proof has not all the &s;trength which it was &s;uppo&s;ed to have, and thus leads us to maintain the opi|nion with a lower degree of a&s;&s;urance than before: when the examination is carried farther, it &s;hows &s;ome argument on which we laid con&s;iderable &s;tre&s;s, to be fallacious and un&s;ound, and, by means of this, it renders us &s;u&s;picious of the &s;olidity of the other evidences, and dubious in our judgment of the whole: and even when a continued ex|amination
<PB N="443" REF="482">
cannot afford po&s;itive proofs that a principle is fal&s;e, it &s;hows at lea&s;t that there is no &s;ufficient rea&s;on to believe it true. This is matter of experience: you cannot name any fal&s;e opinion which did not lo&s;e by being examined, and lo&s;e in proportion to the accuracy with which it was exami|ned. But Chri&s;tianity has, on the con|trary, gained by examination. Can there po&s;&s;ibly be a more &s;atisfying proof that it is altogether true? Seeming evi|dence looks &s;pecious only in one lucky attitude; if the evidence of the truth of Chri&s;tianity were not real, could it have born to be &s;et in &s;o great a varie|ty of lights as it has been &s;et in? Eve|ry one of its evidences has been exa|mined &s;eparately: but none of tho&s;e evidences to which Chri&s;t or his apo|&s;tles ever appealed, has been &s;hown to be either wanting, or inconclu&s;ive. On the contrary, additional evidences have
<PB N="444" REF="483">
been perceived, and the force of all of them has been &s;et in &s;o clear a light as to &s;how that, if they who di&s;believe the go&s;pel, would act con&s;i&s;tently, they mu&s;t run into univer&s;al &s;ceptici&s;m, and renounce principles of belief, to which it is nece&s;&s;ary that they yield implicitly every hour in common life, el&s;e &s;pee|dy ruin is the con&s;equence; but which indeed the kind author of our nature has rooted &s;o deeply in our con&s;titu|tion, that in common life the mo&s;t de|termined &s;ceptic cannot re&s;i&s;t their force for a &s;ingle moment; and which, by con&s;equence, it is the plaine&s;t folly and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdity to attempt to re&s;i&s;t in matters of religion. Had the evidences of Chri&s;tianity been ei|ther fictitious or improper, it mu&s;t have been impo&s;&s;ible to point out &s;o deep a foundation for them in human nature.</P>
<P><PB N="445" REF="484">
In Chri&s;tianity, as in every &s;y&s;tem, whether of nature or of art, there are &s;ome parts which, to a &s;uperficial ob&s;er|ver, appear more exceptionable than the re&s;t. If this religion be fal&s;e, it is rea&s;onable to expect, that on examina|tion, tho&s;e parts would be found &s;till more exceptionable, and that by atten|tion to them we &s;hould be led mo&s;t readily to a detection of the cheat. If the rever&s;e has happened, if it has ap|peared on a full examination, that tho&s;e parts of Chri&s;tianity, and tho&s;e circum|&s;tances in its evidence, which are mo&s;t exceptionable to a &s;uperficial ob&s;erver, turn out, when they are &s;ufficiently under&s;tood, &s;ignal indications of ex|cellence, truth, and divinity, there can be no &s;tronger confirmation of that re|ligion. A defect in any hypothe&s;is, or in any machine, which is &s;o obvious as to &s;trike at fir&s;t &s;ight, if it be real, is perceived more clearly by the atten|tive

inquirer, but, if it be only appa|rent, recommends the &s;kill of the in|ventor. The &s;ame conclu&s;ion ought to be adopted with re&s;pect to Chri&s;tiani|ty: the defects which &s;eemed to be|long to it, have been &s;crupulou&s;ly can|va&s;&s;ed, and found to be only imagina|ry. They are therefore like tho&s;e deli|cate &s;trokes in works of art, which di&s;|plea&s;e the uncultivated ta&s;te, but gain the highe&s;t and the mo&s;t permanent ap|probation from tho&s;e who have impro|ved their ta&s;te; or they are like tho&s;e parts of nature, which the ignorant reckon deformed or u&s;ele&s;s, but which the re&s;earches of the curious di&s;cover to be both beautiful and beneficial: the&s;e &s;how the highe&s;t &s;kill; tho&s;e in like manner evidence the mo&s;t unque|&s;tionable truth. For in&s;tance, the mean condition of Je&s;us while he lived on the earth, is a circum&s;tance which Infi|dels have always eagerly laid hold up|on,
<PB N="447" REF="486">
and endeavoured to turn to the di&s;credit of the go&s;pel; but it has been proved that this circum&s;tance not only is incapable of being fairly turned to the di&s;credit of the go&s;pel, but al&s;o in numberle&s;s ways promotes the de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, and renders its truth un|que&s;tionable, and that far more effec|tually than could have been accom|pli&s;hed by his appearing in a more ex|alted &s;phere. When Infidels have cen|&s;ured any of the evidences of the go|&s;pel, and pointed out the objectons to which they judged them liable, they have &s;ometimes conde&s;cended likewi&s;e to inform us, by what means the&s;e evi|dences might, in their apprehen&s;ion, have been rendered convincing, and &s;uitable to a revelation truly divine: but it has always appeared that the e|vidences propo&s;ed by them, would have been le&s;s &s;atisfying, and expo&s;ed to much ju&s;ter objections, than the mo&s;t

between Chri&s;tianity and any fal&s;e religion, than is ea&s;ily accounted for by this obvious reflection. The re&s;em|blance, however great it may &s;eem in &s;ome particulars at fir&s;t &s;ight, grows al|ways fainter and fainter, the more clo&s;e|ly it is traced; and on an exact compa|ri&s;on, Chri&s;tianity is found to be in its whole &s;pirit and evidences the very op|po&s;ite of every fal&s;e religion. Thus two faces may be mi&s;taken for each other when they are &s;een &s;eparately and little attended to, between which &s;carce a|ny re&s;emblance can be perceived when they are deliberately viewed together. In a word, Chri&s;tianity has been &s;o much confirmed by examination, that even whatever &s;eemed to be exception|able in it, has been converted into a new pre&s;umption of its truth.&mdash;No &s;ubject has undergone &s;o free or &s;o fre|quent examination, as Chri&s;tianity; and no &s;ubject ever gained &s;o much

by examination. Every book that e|ver was written again&s;t this religion, has, in the cour&s;e of the controver&s;y to which it gave ri&s;e, occa&s;ioned &s;ome improvement in the defence of Chri&s;ti|anity. Every objection that has been &s;tarted, has produced an&s;wers which &s;howed the &s;trength of &s;ome of the e|vidences of the go&s;pel, in a new and &s;triking point of view. And &s;ince Chri|&s;tianity, far from being confuted, has been &s;o much confirmed by an oppo&s;i|tion of argument &s;o often renewed, &s;o long continued, and &s;o eagerly pro&s;e|cuted, the inference is &s;hort and clear. This is peculiar to truth; it leaves no room for the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of fal&s;e|hood.</P>
<P>If Chri&s;tianity were a fal&s;e religion notwith&s;tanding all the trials which it has undergone, and the manner in which it has &s;u&s;tained them, it would be ab&s;olutely &s;ingular and without a
<PB N="451" REF="490">
parallel on earth. Many fal&s;e tenets and fal&s;e religions have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for a long time; it is acknowledged: yet if Chri&s;tianity were fal&s;e, it would &s;till be without a parallel. For has any of the&s;e fal&s;ehoods been examined and canva&s;|&s;ed in the &s;ame manner as Chri&s;tianity has, and been retained notwith&s;tand|ing? None of them has. In number|le&s;s ways, fal&s;e opinions may gain ground; and when they have been once adopted, they may be for ages tran&s;mitted from &s;ome to others, with|out being at all &s;u&s;pected or examined: but an opinion's &s;ub&s;i&s;ting ever &s;o long while it is not examined, affords no &s;ort of pre&s;umption of its truth. The Pto|lemaic &s;y&s;tem of the world was long the received hypothe&s;is: but its reception was no proof of its truth. During all that time, it was taken for granted without examination: mo&s;t men want|ed the means of bringing it to a pro|per
<PB N="452" REF="491">
trial; if a few had them, and u&s;ed them, they di&s;believed it; and as &s;oon as it was generally examined, it was generally exploded. It did not require repeated examinations to confute it; it fell at once, upon the fir&s;t &s;crutiny of unprejudiced rea&s;on. Many fal&s;e hypothe&s;es have reigned in every &s;ci|ence, through long periods of time. Attend to &s;uch of them as are now a|bandoned: you will find that they were e&s;tabli&s;hed on fal&s;e <HI>principles</HI> which, du|ring their reign, were never called in que&s;tion. Their prevalence, therefore, truly proceeded from men's having ne|ver examined the&s;e principles: as &s;oon as the&s;e were examined, it appeared that they had been all along taken for granted without evidence; that, there|fore, however well the &s;everal parts of the &s;uper&s;tructure hung together, the whole hypothe&s;is was neverthele&s;s a mere ba&s;ele&s;s fabric. The &s;ame has
<PB N="453" REF="492">
happened in religion, as in &s;cience. The Pagan religion was of very long duration: but every one knows that many cau&s;es prevented its being tho|roughly examined; that, as imperfect|ly as it was examined, it did not &s;tand unconfuted all the time it continued to &s;ub&s;i&s;t; and that, when it came to be fully canva&s;&s;ed, no rational defence was offered for it. Mahometani&s;m has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;everal ages: but it is be|cau&s;e its evidence has never been exa|mined by tho&s;e who profe&s;s it. By all who have examined it, it has been pro|nounced de&s;titute of evidence: many have embraced it from other motives; but it does not appear that any ever turned to it in con&s;equence of a deli|berate inquiry into its truth. The fate of Popery is no exception again&s;t this argument. It ro&s;e in dark times, and therefore without examination. It ac|quired its pre&s;ent form by a gradual
<PB N="454" REF="493">
corruption of Chri&s;tianity; each &s;tep prepared the way for another; and therefore it advanced imperceptibly and without &s;u&s;picion. It forbids free inquiry, and therefore has never been examined by tho&s;e who hold it. At lea&s;t, if any of them have examined it to a certain degree, they have never|thele&s;s &s;topped &s;hort before they &s;earch|ed it thoroughly: they &s;till took for granted certain fir&s;t principles on which it is founded, the authority, for in|&s;tance, of Popes, Councils, Fathers, and Doctors; principles which ought not to have been taken upon tru&s;t, but proved very clearly, for which however no &s;olid proof has been produced. Po|pery has been examined by tho&s;e who believed it not: and whether they have not attacked it in a fairer way than that in which Infidels have oppo&s;ed the go|&s;pel; whether they have not readily ta|ken notice of all the pleas of its pa|trons,
<PB N="455" REF="494">
and undertaken to confute them; or whether their objections again&s;t it, have been an&s;wered &s;o fully, &s;o freely, upon &s;o unexceptionable principles, or by &s;o &s;trong rea&s;onings, as the objec|tions of Infidels again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, we may appeal to every impartial per|&s;on who takes the trouble to examine both the controver&s;ies. At any rate, it will not be pretended, that Popery has gained by examination, or been confirmed by the oppo&s;ition of Prote|&s;tants: on the contrary, its votaries have been induced to alter their &s;y&s;tem, to refine upon their principles, to re|nounce or explain away tenets expre&s;s|ly taught in books to which they &s;till in words a&s;cribe the highe&s;t authority, and which they even profe&s;s to believe infallible. <Q REND="inline">"But has not the &s;ame hap|pened to the Chri&s;tian religion? Have not doctrines which were once reckoned a part of this religion,
<PB N="456" REF="495">
been abandoned in con&s;equence of the inquiries occa&s;ioned by infidelity?"</Q> That this has happened, we readily ac|knowledge; but this is not the &s;ame that has happened to Popery; nay, tho' on a &s;uperficial view, it &s;eemeth &s;omewhat like, it is in reality directly contrary. Chri&s;tians have never given up as inde&s;en&s;ible, any doctrine plain|ly taught in &s;cripture; Papi&s;ts have gi|ven up doctrines mo&s;t indi&s;putably in|culcated by Popes, Councils, and Doc|tors. Chri&s;tians have renounced on|ly errors which had in&s;inuated them|&s;elves into their religion, but really made no part of it; if they be likewi&s;e errors which inquiry has forced Papi&s;ts to renounce, yet they are &s;uch errors as compo&s;e the very &s;ub&s;tance of Pope|ry, &s;o far as it differs from the religion of other Chri&s;tians. The &s;cripture is the avowed &s;tandard of Chri&s;tianity, by which whatever is a&s;&s;erted to be|long
<PB N="457" REF="496">
to it, may be tried; the oppo&s;i|&s;ition of Infidels has only excited Chri&s;tians to &s;tudy the &s;cripture with greater care, and to render their o|pinions more conformable to it: Po|pery owns &s;ome &s;tandards additional to the &s;criptures; the oppo&s;ition of Prote&s;tants has reduced its profe&s;&s;ors to the nece&s;&s;ity of deviating from the&s;e additional &s;tandards. In a word, that Chri&s;tianity has been examined, there are the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable documents, the writings of unbelievers: it has not fallen before one or a few attacks: ob|jections of all kinds have been rai&s;ed a|gain&s;t it: the fir&s;t principles on which its evidences re&s;t, as well as the rea&s;on|ings by which they are &s;upported, have been tried, and found to be the very principles of belief natural to the hu|man under&s;tanding, to which men ne|ce&s;&s;arily yield in innumerable ca&s;es: many have inquired into its grounds
<PB N="458" REF="497">
with the greate&s;t freedom, and after all embraced it as divine with higher a&s;&s;urance than before: by oppo&s;ition, none of its proofs has been invalidated, all of them have been illu&s;trated and &s;trengthened. There is therefore an e&s;&s;ential difference between Chri&s;tiani|ty, and all the fal&s;e doctrines which e|ver obtained a durable reception. If that be fal&s;e, it is the only fal&s;ehood that ever &s;u&s;tained &s;o accurate an exa|mination. Its having &s;u&s;tained this examination, its having even derived advantage from it, &s;ets it in direct op|po&s;ition to fal&s;ehood and impo&s;ture, and proves that it is, what it claims to be, true and divine.</P>
<P>THE argument for the truth of Chri|&s;tianity, which we have endeavoured to illu&s;trate, depends on two propo&s;i|tions; the fir&s;t, That Chri&s;tianity, far from being overthrown by the oppo&s;i|tion
<PB N="459" REF="498">
of argument, has been confirmed by it; the other, That not to be over|thrown, much more to be confirmed, by the oppo&s;ition of argument, and by free inquiry, is a certain and un|equivocal characteri&s;tic of truth. The latter propo&s;ition is both obvious and undeniable. Were the evidence of the former equally clear and immediate, or capable of being rendered as ab&s;o|lutely incontrovertible, the argument could not fail to be perfectly &s;atisfying to every man; the conclu&s;ion, That Chri&s;tianity is true, would &s;trike the mind with a degree of force nowi&s;e in|ferior to that of the &s;tricte&s;t demon&s;tra|tion. But the former propo&s;ition re|lates to a matter of fact, which, in its very nature, admits only &s;uch evidence as mu&s;t appear different to different men, and can never be rendered whol|ly unexceptionable to every individual. The fact mu&s;t be a&s;certained by a com|pari&s;on
<PB N="460" REF="499">
of the writings of Infidels, with tho&s;e of Chri&s;tians, and will be admit|ted or denied, and that with greater or le&s;s a&s;&s;urance, according to the judgment which any per&s;on forms on the compari&s;on. The fact is not &s;u&s;|ceptible of any other &s;ort of evidence; and by this &s;ort it has been proved, in the preceeding &s;ections, as clearly as could be expected on &s;uppo&s;ition of its truth. But &s;ince the only po&s;&s;ible evi|dence is of this kind, it mu&s;t be owned, that the argument will appear incon|clu&s;ive to &s;ome, and will be thought by others to fall &s;hort of demon&s;tration. This does not render the argument void either of force, or of utility; but it renders it proper to examine what pre|ci&s;e degree of force ought to be a&s;cri|bed to it.</P>
<P>That Chri&s;tianity has not been con|&s;uted, but e&s;tabli&s;hed, by the oppo&s;i|tion of its adver&s;aries, Infidels will not
<PB N="461" REF="500">
acknowledge; they cannot con&s;i&s;tent|ly acknowledge it, and yet continue Infidels. On Infidels therefore, it may be thought, the argument can make no impre&s;&s;ion. Indeed, while they deny the fact on which the argument is founded, it cannot immediately and directly tend to their conviction: yet it ought to have &s;ome &s;ort of influence even upon them, by means of which it may contribute indirectly to their con|viction. The impo&s;&s;ibility of an Infi|del's allowing the fact from which the pre&s;ent argument is deduced, and yet continuing an Infidel, &s;hows, that, on &s;uppo&s;ition of the truth of the fact, the argument is perfectly deci&s;ive. If, on that &s;uppo&s;ition, it be deci&s;ive, it mu&s;t be incumbent on Infidels, to examine carefully and impartially, whether the fact be true or not. This is the method of obtaining &s;atisfaction, to which both curio&s;ity and candour prompt men in
<PB N="462" REF="501">
other controverted &s;ubjects, tho' in many of the&s;e they are not &s;o deeply intere&s;ted as in religion. If Infidels decline this examination, they can have no right to deny the fact; it may be true for any thing they know: they have been at no pains to inquire about it; and therefore their denial of it, can merit no regard, and ought not to be allowed by any man to infu&s;e into his mind the fainte&s;t &s;u&s;picion of its truth. If they decline the examination, they cannot approve them&s;elves in their un|belief; they mu&s;t be con&s;cious of wil|ful negligence. They have no ju&s;t claim to the favourable &s;entiments of Chri&s;tians: the&s;e are due only to tho&s;e who have u&s;ed all the means of di&s;co|vering the truth, which impartiality requires, and which God has put in their power, and after all are &s;o unhap|py as not to find &s;ufficient rea&s;on for believing the go&s;pel; they are not at
<PB N="463" REF="502">
all due to them who eagerly adopt a conclu&s;ion again&s;t the go&s;pel, without ever taking into con&s;ideration, the principles on which its truth or its fal&s;e|hood depends. However impo&s;&s;ible it may be in fact to convince the&s;e per|&s;ons, either that Chri&s;tianity is true, or that it has gained by oppo&s;ition; it is notwith&s;tanding plain, that, even &s;up|po&s;ing the&s;e propo&s;itions fal&s;e, they cannot <HI>rea&s;onably</HI> believe them fal&s;e. Be|fore they can rea&s;onably commence In|fidels, they mu&s;t con&s;ider, What the evidences of the go&s;pel truly are? Whe|ther they have real &s;olidity and force? Whether they have been overturned by the objections which have been rai&s;ed again&s;t them? Whether, on the con|trary, the&s;e objections have not been fully an&s;wered, and even turned, in many in&s;tances, into arguments for cor|roborating the evidences of the go&s;pel?&mdash;On what principles can it be denied,
<PB N="464" REF="503">
that it is incumbent on every per&s;on to go through this whole inquiry, before he can rea&s;onably reject the go&s;pel? A religion is propo&s;ed to men, as reveal|ed by God: if it be really revealed by him, without que&s;tion it merits the greate&s;t regard. It builds its claim to a divine original, on certain evidences to which it explicitly appeals: the&s;e ought certainly to be canva&s;&s;ed with the &s;tricte&s;t impartiality, before they be declared in&s;ufficient. If they do not &s;atisfy you, you ought to know why they do not, and wherein they fail. If you publi&s;h to the world, that you are not &s;atisfied with them, you ought al&s;o to publi&s;h your rea&s;ons, and to point out the defects which you have ob&s;erved in them. Many have done &s;o; an&s;wers have been offered to their objections; of mo&s;t of the&s;e an&s;wers, no confutation has been &s;o much as attempted; they mu&s;t therefore in all
<PB N="465" REF="504">
fairne&s;s be reckoned &s;olid. Since the controver&s;y is already brought to this &s;tate, the natural and the only way of attacking Chri&s;tianity, is to confute the an&s;wers which have been returned to the objections rai&s;ed again&s;t it. In con&s;equence of this, Infidels ought to pur&s;ue a method perfectly the rever&s;e of that which they have hitherto pur|&s;ued; they ought to &s;et them&s;elves to examine and to overturn the defences of Chri&s;tianity; this, the love of truth ab&s;olutely requires of them. It is a|mong the young, the thoughtle&s;s, and the di&s;&s;ipated, that infidelity has chief|ly prevailed: but from the ob&s;ervations ju&s;t now made, it is plain that among them infidelity never can prevail on principles of rea&s;on: Suppo&s;e that there were good rea&s;on for infidelity, yet, as matters now &s;tand, an attentive and careful inquiry is nece&s;&s;ary, before that good rea&s;on can be di&s;covered; and
<PB N="466" REF="505">
to &s;uch an inquiry the&s;e per&s;ons have not &s;ubmitted. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, the very greate&s;t abilities, without this inquiry, are not &s;ufficient for enabling a man to perceive, that Chri&s;tianity has no ju&s;t foundation: af|ter &s;o many objections have been mo|ved again&s;t it, and after it has been &s;o often and in &s;uch various ways vindi|cated from them, a rational determi|nation that it is not true, nece&s;&s;arily depends on the knowledge of many points which cannot be learned by the greate&s;t abilities in an in&s;tant, or with|out a deliberate and exten&s;ive inve&s;ti|gation. Whatever be the objection which &s;tartles you, tho' you can &s;ee no way of removing it, yet an an&s;wer has been perhaps made to it by others, with which you would be fully &s;atisfied: it is nece&s;&s;ary at lea&s;t that you &s;hould inquire, whether there has not, before you can rea&s;onably hold your objection
<PB N="467" REF="506">
to be unan&s;werable. Thus all men are obliged, before they can rea&s;onably di&s;believe the go&s;pel, to go through an inquiry which will put it in their pow|er to decide with under&s;tanding, con|cerning the fact on which our pre&s;ent argument depends. If they decline the inquiry, they may deny the force of the argument; but they act a ra&s;h and unrea&s;onable part in denying it. If they make the inquiry, and find the fact to be as we have repre&s;ented it, the argument will &s;trike into their minds a conviction of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, with the irre&s;i&s;tible force of demon&s;tration. If, after a careful and impartial inquiry, any per&s;on &s;hould be of opinion, that Chri&s;tianity has been overthrown by the objections of Infidels, and clearly proved to be fal&s;e, he mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be left to fol|low his own judgment. But it may neverthele&s;s be very plain, that he is
<PB N="468" REF="507">
in an error. On every other &s;ubject, as well as on this, it is impo&s;&s;ible to force conviction on tho&s;e who are di&s;|po&s;ed to deny; the under&s;tanding of each individual mu&s;t ultimately deter|mine for him in every ca&s;e: yet it does not follow, that there is no difference between truth and error, or that there is not any truth which can be &s;aid to be fully proved, becau&s;e there is almo&s;t no truth which will not be denied by &s;ome. In like manner, tho' there may be per&s;ons who will perceive no force in the pre&s;ent argument, it by no means follows that it is not in it&s;elf a ju&s;t and a &s;trong argument for the truth of our religion.</P>
<P>THE argument which I have now urged, cannot naturally be that which will <HI>fir&s;t</HI> convince a man of the truth of Chri&s;tianity. On the contrary, it &s;uppo&s;es that a per&s;on has already ex|amined the &s;everal more direct eviden|ces
<PB N="469" REF="508">
of this religion, perceived their force, and found them &s;ufficiently vin|dicated from all exceptions. Till he has done &s;o, he cannot feel the force of this argument. Its proper de&s;ign is, to <HI>&s;trengthen</HI> the faith which has been already produced by more direct proofs. This purpo&s;e, it will very powerfully promote. When a per&s;on attends to the &s;everal evidences of the go&s;pel, he is convinced by them; con|&s;cious that they are in fact convincing, he has not naturally any propen&s;ity to &s;uppo&s;e, that they may notwith&s;tanding be liable to objections which can inva|lidate them, or, on account of the po&s;|&s;ibility of &s;uch objections, to he&s;itate in yielding his a&s;&s;ent: But when he has examined the objections which have been moved again&s;t the&s;e evidences, when he finds that they do not invali|date the evidences, that they leave them in their full force, that they even
<PB N="470" REF="509">
di&s;play the &s;trength of the proof, that they have i&s;&s;ued in the confirmation of the go&s;pel, his a&s;&s;ent nece&s;&s;arily be|comes more a&s;&s;ured. Now he does not merely <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> that there are no va|lid objections again&s;t the evidences of the go&s;pel; he has <HI>po&s;itive proof</HI> that there are none. When we attend to the evidences of any truth, they ope|rate <HI>directly</HI> on the under&s;tanding, as the natural cau&s;es of belief; they do convince, and this is a &s;ufficient foun|dation for our a&s;&s;ent: but when we examine the objections again&s;t them, and the defences of them, the mind exerts a <HI>reflex</HI> act, by which it per|ceives that they ought to convince us; this cannot fail to make us acquie&s;ce in their &s;ufficiency with the mo&s;t en|tire and explicite complacence.</P>

But, when a per&s;on re&s;i&s;ts the po&s;itive evidence which is produced, and moves objections, the ca&s;e is very different: it is incumbent on him to point out &s;ome real failure in it; if it has been already charged with the &s;ame failure and vindicated from it, he mu&s;t exa|mine whether the vindication be &s;uffi|cient, and, if not, he mu&s;t be able to &s;how where the defect lies; otherwi&s;e he counteracts the principles of the hu|man con&s;titution, which naturally lead us to yield to evidence, when it has

force enough to produce a&s;&s;ent, and we perceive no fallacy in it. This dif|ference between their &s;ituation, who yield to po&s;itive evidence, and their's who re&s;i&s;t it, takes place in every ca&s;e. A propo&s;ition in Euclid's elements is demon&s;trated; if a per&s;on comprehend the demon&s;tration, he nece&s;&s;arily gives credit to it; and he is perfectly ratio|nal in giving credit to it, tho' he be not acquainted with any of the objections which &s;ome Metaphy&s;icians have rai|&s;ed again&s;t the exactne&s;s of mathemati|cal rea&s;oning, nor with the &s;olutions of them. But if a per&s;on, on the con|trary, after comprehending the demon|&s;tration, refu&s;es to admit the propo&s;i|tion, he certainly acts unrea&s;onably, except he can clearly perceive the de|fect of the demon&s;tration, and the in|&s;ufficiency of what has been urged for vindicating it from the imputation of that defect. Univer&s;ally, a more ex|ten&s;ive
<PB N="476" REF="515">
inquiry is incumbent upon him who re&s;i&s;ts the po&s;itive evidence offer|ed in a ca&s;e, and thus holds him&s;elf ca|pable of &s;crutinizing it, than upon him who, owning its force, readily yields it the a&s;&s;ent which it demands: the for|mer mu&s;t always be able to give the rea&s;ons of his unbelief; of the belief of the latter, it is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on, that the con&s;titution of his nature leads him to be convinced, tho' he cannot explain the grounds of his conviction in a philo&s;ophical manner. None will a&s;&s;ert that an ordinary man acts an un|rea&s;onable part, in readily believing, that food will continue to nouri&s;h, &s;leep to refre&s;h, and the &s;un to ri&s;e and &s;et at &s;tated hours: but all would laugh at the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of a &s;ceptical philo&s;opher, who &s;hould deny the&s;e propo&s;itions, and yet refu&s;e to explain wherein he thought that their evidence failed, or to li&s;ten to a vindication of
<PB N="477" REF="516">
it. To render a per&s;on rea&s;onable in believing any propo&s;ition for which po|&s;itive proof is offered, it is not nece&s;&s;a|ry that he be acquainted with <HI>all</HI> the evidences of it; he may perceive evi|dence enough to &s;atisfy him, tho' he perceive not all: but he cannot be rea&s;onable in rejecting it, unle&s;s he has attended to the whole of the proof that is offered; tho' one part of it does not &s;atisfy him, another may. To pre|tend that a Chri&s;tian is not rea&s;onable in believing, unle&s;s he has di&s;cu&s;&s;ed all the objections of Infidels, is to beg the que&s;tion, to take it for granted that the evidences of the go&s;pel are not real; for, on &s;uppo&s;ition that they are, it is entirely rational to yield readily to their force. But, tho' Chri&s;tianity &s;hould happen to be fal&s;e, and its evidences fallacious, the Infidel mu&s;t be unrea|&s;onable in rejecting it, without a full examination of the an&s;wers which have
<PB N="478" REF="517">
been returned to objections; for po&s;i|tive evidence can never fairly be &s;et a|&s;ide without being po&s;itively confuted. Infidels make high preten&s;ions to a &s;pi|rit of inquiry; but they mu&s;t pu&s;h their inquiries farther than they generally do, before their infidelity can be in a|ny degree rea&s;onable. They are eager to charge Chri&s;tians with credulity; but the charge would not be ju&s;t, tho' Chri&s;tians had not examined the argu|ments of Infidels &s;o minutely as many of them have. To give a quick a&s;&s;ent to evidence real and natural in it&s;elf, never can be blameable credulity; to refu&s;e it, or to give it with difficulty, is always faulty &s;ceptici&s;m. Thus the oppo&s;ition of Infidels, and the mani|&s;old defences of Chri&s;tianity occa&s;ion|ed by it, are of no <HI>detriment</HI> even to the generality; they do not render it more difficult or laborious to become a rati|onal believer, than it was before. Nay
<PB N="479" REF="518">
even to the generality, con&s;iderable <HI>ad|vantages</HI> are derived from them.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, by means of them, they are excited to attend to the grounds and evidences of their religion, and are naturally led, tho' not to enter into all the intricacies of argument concern|ing them, yet to examine them, at lea&s;t, &s;o far as to acquire a di&s;tinct concep|tion of their nature and force, as they are propo&s;ed in the New Te&s;tament: and, if the&s;e evidences propo&s;ed in this manner, be &s;ufficient for begetting conviction, the generality, being thus led to attend to them, will come to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a truly rational faith in the go&s;pel. Had no oppo&s;ition been made by Infidels, Chri&s;tians would run a ri&s;k of becoming inattentive to the evi|dences of the go&s;pel, and negligent in their endeavours to under&s;tand them: that oppo&s;ition is a continual antidote again&s;t this. In the beginning of Chri|&s;tianity,
<PB N="480" REF="519">
many things contributed to prevent this: the evidences of the go|&s;pel, from their very nature, excited attention in that age; in the fir&s;t exhi|bition, many of them were pre&s;ented to the very &s;en&s;es of men; they could not be overlooked; every per&s;on who yielded a&s;&s;ent to them, was unavoid|ably con&s;cious of the rea&s;ons on which his a&s;&s;ent was founded; and con&s;e|quently his faith was nece&s;&s;arily ratio|nal: be&s;ides, the prejudices ari&s;ing from their education in other religions, and the dangers to which they were expo|&s;ed by becoming Chri&s;tians, could not fail to render them &s;crupulous in exa|mining the evidence propo&s;ed to them, and careful to be fully &s;atisfied of its &s;ufficiency, before they admitted it, or profe&s;&s;ed their faith in con&s;equence of it. But the circum&s;tances of the world are now &s;o much altered, that men may be &s;ometimes led to profe&s;s Chri|&s;tianity,
<PB N="481" REF="520">
and even to embrace it, with|out any examination of its evidences, without &s;o much as a tolerable appre|hen&s;ion of them, as they ly in the Bi|ble. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;pend words in pointing out the feeblene&s;s, the in|efficacy, the di&s;advantages of various kinds, which mu&s;t attend a faith &s;o &s;len|derly, &s;o imperfectly &s;upported: they are extremely obvious. Now the con|tinual oppo&s;ition of Infidels has a na|tural and &s;trong tendency to hinder men from thus taking their religion al|together upon tru&s;t: and, except the exi&s;tence of other religions, it is per|haps the only <HI>external</HI> cau&s;e by which Chri&s;tians are prompted to examine the foundations of their religion. It leads tho&s;e who have been educated in Chri|&s;tianity, to reflect, whether this reli|gion may not neverthele&s;s be fal&s;e: If they have either &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s or curio&s;i|ty, this reflection will make them &s;olli|citous
<PB N="482" REF="521">
to examine, whether it is or not; and all who have ordinary abilities and hone&s;ty of heart, may determine this point without any very difficult or in|tricate inquiry: and when, in con&s;e|quence of attentive inquiry, they de|termine that it is a true and divine re|ligion, when they believe it with the &s;ub&s;tance of its evidence full in their view, their faith is truly rational, it has &s;trength and firmne&s;s, by means of which it may produce a concern to comply with the go&s;pel, and con&s;tancy in adhering to it. There will always, no doubt, be &s;ome Chri&s;tians who have not attended to the evidences of the go&s;pel, nor can give any rea&s;on for their embracing it: but where its truth is openly attacked by Infidels, this will be the ca&s;e much le&s;s generally than it would otherwi&s;e have been. There may be &s;en&s;ible Chri&s;tians at pre&s;ent, who could not perhaps give a direct
<PB N="483" REF="522">
an&s;wer to every objection urged by In|fidels; but there are very few of them who are not believers in con&s;equence of attention to the evidences of the go|&s;pel, and real conviction of their &s;uffi|ciency. At whatever period oppo&s;i|tion from Infidels &s;hall cea&s;e, the re|membrance of it will continue to pro|duce this effect in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to ex|cite Chri&s;tians to obtain a rational faith; and at the &s;ame time, its having been defeated, will be a &s;trong argument of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, and will con|tribute to render their faith firm, in like manner as the original propaga|tion of the go&s;pel is one ground of be|lief to us.</P>
<P>Again, the oppo&s;ition of Infidels is of real advantage even to the generali|ty, by leading to &s;uch a manner of pro|po&s;ing the evidences of the go&s;pel, as will mo&s;t effectually produce convic|tion in them. In order to convince
<PB N="484" REF="523">
any per&s;on, the evidences of the go|&s;pel mu&s;t be properly propo&s;ed. If in the propo&s;al they were loaded with un|e&s;&s;ential or precarious circum&s;tances, a man's natural &s;agacity might &s;ugge&s;t difficulties, and occa&s;ion doubts, and thus weaken his belief. But an ac|quaintance with the &s;everal objections of Infidels, will naturally lead one to propo&s;e them in a preci&s;e and guarded manner, and to repre&s;ent every evi|dence in that ju&s;t and &s;triking point of view, in which it will mo&s;t quickly and certainly lay hold of the under&s;tand|ing. The &s;upernatural knowledge of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, enabled them, previous to all oppo&s;ition, to propo&s;e the evidences of their mi&s;&s;ion in an ex|act and convincing manner, even when they propo&s;ed them mo&s;t &s;imply: but no unin&s;pired per&s;on could even col|lect and put together the &s;everal evi|dences to which they occa&s;ionally ap|pealed,
<PB N="485" REF="524">
&s;o as to pre&s;erve them in their greate&s;t force, without a di&s;tinct com|prehen&s;ion of their nature, of the cir|cum&s;tances on which their &s;trength de|pends, and of the objections to which they are mo&s;t liable; and this can be acquired only by an exten&s;ive acquain|tance with the oppo&s;ition which Infi|dels have actually made.&mdash;Thus even the <HI>generality</HI> derive real advantage for their e&s;tabli&s;hment in Chri&s;tianity, from the oppo&s;ition of Infidels, and from the manner of exhibiting the evidences of the go&s;pel, to which it naturally leads. But to &s;ome men the advantage thence re&s;ulting, is much greater and more e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>Some are naturally captious; they have a propen&s;ity to rai&s;e objections on every &s;ubject; they have a turn of un|der&s;tanding, which makes them apter to doubt than to believe; they have a greater capacity for rai&s;ing difficulties,
<PB N="486" REF="525">
than for removing them. This is an intel|lectual di&s;temper; but it is no uncom|mon one; and to the oppo&s;ition of In|fidels it is owing, that medicine pro|per for this di&s;temper, is continually in readine&s;s. In con&s;equence of that op|po&s;ition, an&s;wers have been made to multitudes of objections again&s;t the go|&s;pel: when, therefore, any of the&s;e ob|jections occur to a per&s;on, he can ea&s;ily di&s;cover what has been advanced for the &s;olution of it; and if that prove &s;a|tisfying to him, he is delivered from his doubts. If it prove not &s;atisfying, he can point out the fallacy which he ob&s;erves in the &s;olution; and this con|duct will either give occa&s;ion to a bet|ter &s;olution, or make the objection to be acknowledged in the end &s;olid and unan&s;werable. An in&s;tance in which the latter effect has taken place, has not hitherto occurred; the former there|fore may mo&s;t naturally be expected.
<PB N="487" REF="526">
Every objection propo&s;ed, has been &s;o often and &s;o fully an&s;wered, that the mo&s;t exceptious per&s;on, if he has only candour, cannot entertain a doubt con|cerning the truth of Chri&s;tianity, ex|cept he has either di&s;covered an objec|tion that is new, or examined the an|&s;wers to old objections and found them in&s;ufficient. But indeed, if no objec|tion were publi&s;hed but what is new, or if no objection were repeated till the an&s;wers already given were fir&s;t confuted, far the greater part of the volumes of Infidels had never &s;een the light.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome men who&s;e abilities and improvements enable them to take in a di&s;tinct conception of the eviden|ces of the go&s;pel, to comprehend the whole &s;eries of proofs, exceptions and an&s;wers. To &s;uch men, that particular di&s;play of tho&s;e evidences, which the efforts of infidelity have occa&s;ioned,
<PB N="488" REF="527">
renders them more &s;atisfying, and ca|pable of impre&s;&s;ing a deeper faith, than if they had been more &s;imply propo|&s;ed. Their a&s;&s;ent will not be altogether &s;o quick or ready, but it will in the i&s;|&s;ue be much more a&s;&s;ured. No &s;u&s;pi|cion of fallacy remains to di&s;turb their full acquie&s;cence in the conclu&s;ion, or to dimini&s;h the firmne&s;s of their faith. Whatever could breed &s;u&s;picion, has been already examined, and explicitly renounced. <Q REND="inline">"But would it not have been &s;till better, if no objections had been rai&s;ed, and if con&s;equently no an&s;wers had been nece&s;&s;ary?"</Q> While men continue men, that is impo&s;&s;ible. There is no &s;ubject on which &s;pecula|tive men can employ their attention or indulge their ingenuity, but difficul|ties will occur upon it, and objections will be rai&s;ed. If a &s;ubject be capa|ble of being perfectly freed from the hazard of di&s;putation, yet this can hap|pen
<PB N="489" REF="528">
only after all po&s;&s;ible objections have been actually propo&s;ed and an|&s;wered. There is thus a certain cour&s;e of trial which truth mu&s;t go through, before it be &s;o fully a&s;certained as to gain an univer&s;al reception without further que&s;tion; and when it comes near to the end of this cour&s;e, it is in a more advantageous &s;ituation, than it could be in, when it had its pro|gre&s;s yet to begin. When the vin|dication of it is completed, this re|&s;tores not the truth merely to its ori|ginal &s;ituation; it moreover renders it le&s;s liable to be again denied: many of the arts by which &s;ceptici&s;m might attack it, are already detected, and many of its cavils expo&s;ed; &s;o that fewer arts remain, by which they who are acquainted with the controver&s;y, can be again debauched from the ac|knowledgment of it.</P>
<P><PB N="490" REF="529">
Tho' the light and confirmation which the evidences of Chri&s;tianity have received from the oppo&s;ition of Infidels, had not been in the&s;e ways of actual advantage to that religion; yet &s;till its having received them, would afford the &s;trong pre&s;umption of its truth, which I have endeavoured to &s;tate. For this pre&s;umption ari&s;es from the e&s;&s;ential difference between truth and fal&s;ehood, and therefore cannot be de&s;troyed by any accidental con&s;e|quences to which the weakne&s;s or the perver&s;ene&s;s of men may give occa&s;ion. That is undoubtedly fal&s;e, however &s;pecious, which a fair examination o|verthrows: that is certainly true, which, by the mo&s;t rigid examination of its e|vidences, is not confuted, but confirm|ed. This will always remain an infal|lible criterion, to whatever bad purpo|&s;es men may happen to abu&s;e the exa|mination from which it ari&s;es. But
<PB N="491" REF="530">
when the oppo&s;ition of Infidels has not only contributed to the illu&s;tration of the evidences of the go&s;pel, con&s;ider|ed ab&s;tractly, but al&s;o, as has been ju&s;t now &s;hown, actually puts men of all different characters, provided they will only &s;eriou&s;ly inquire, into a better &s;i|tuation for obtaining faith in the go|&s;pel, or for rendering their faith firm, than they could have been in, without it; this makes the argument in favour of Chri&s;tianity, to appear to &s;till great|er advantage. It makes it indi&s;puta|ble, that the confirmation which its e|vidences have received, is real: it &s;hows it to be not only real, but important: it gives the mind a propen&s;ity to be|lieve the go&s;pel, which will enable both this pre&s;umption and every other evi|dence of its truth, to operate more &s;trongly on it, to lay fa&s;ter hold of it, and to produce fuller and more &s;teady belief.</P>
<P><PB N="492" REF="531">
To confirm us in the belief of Chri|&s;tianity, is the purpo&s;e to which the argument of this di&s;&s;ertation, is mo&s;t directly &s;ub&s;ervient. But it likewi&s;e naturally &s;ugge&s;ts a very &s;trong rea&s;on for moderation and forbearance to|wards tho&s;e who di&s;believe the go&s;pel, and freely propo&s;e their objections a|gain&s;t it. Chri&s;tianity is &s;o evidently true, and &s;o highly conducive to the mo&s;t important intere&s;ts of mankind, that we can &s;carce fail to regard tho&s;e with pity, who are &s;o unhappy as to reject it. At the &s;ame time, their op|po&s;ition to evidence which we reckon &s;o clear and convincing, and the ma|ny mi&s;chievous con&s;equences which &s;pring immediately from the propaga|tion of infidelity, are very apt to rai&s;e indignation in tho&s;e who are warmly concerned for truth and goodne&s;s. If this &s;entiment be kept from exceeding due bounds, and from exerting it&s;elf
<PB N="493" REF="532">
in an improper manner, if it prompt us only to u&s;e our utmo&s;t endeavours to convince the unbelieving by argu|ment, and to fortify others again&s;t the infection of their principles, it is na|tural and worthy. But it too frequent|ly degenerates into anger, and prompts to illegitimate methods of curbing in|fidelity; it has led Chri&s;tians to attack unbelievers by force, and violence, and penal laws. There are many ar|guments again&s;t this. It is unlawful in it&s;elf, and therefore ab&s;olutely to be avoided: however pernicious the im|mediate con&s;equences of propagating infidelity are, it mu&s;t always be wrong to endeavour to prevent them by means that are unlawful. Be&s;ides, this me|thod of oppo&s;ing infidelity will always prove ineffectual; force may make men di&s;&s;emble their unbelief, or ren|der them more cautious in avowing it; but it will never move them to aban|don
<PB N="494" REF="533">
it, and it will make them more eager to in&s;til it into others whenever they can with &s;afety, and more artful in the manner of in&s;tilling it: it would therefore be fooli&s;h, tho' it were not unlawful, to have recour&s;e to violence. This would be not only ineffectual for repre&s;&s;ing infidelity, but even really detrimental to Chri&s;tianity. Zeal for this religion, is the pretended motive to the u&s;e of violence again&s;t unbelie|vers; but true and rea&s;onable zeal for it, would be the mo&s;t powerful re|&s;traint from this conduct, becau&s;e it hurts it in many ways. It &s;eems to betray a diffidence of the truth of Chri|&s;tianity. It gives an appearance of boldne&s;s and intrepidity to the oppo|&s;ition of Infidels, which makes the un|thinking more prone to li&s;ten to them, and more &s;u&s;ceptible of a deep impre&s;|&s;ion from their arguments. It gives them a handle for pretending, after
<PB N="495" REF="534">
they have publi&s;hed all the objections which they can, that they have &s;trong|er in re&s;erve, but that it is not &s;afe for them to produce them: they have not failed to avail them&s;elves of this pre|tence, tho' they have often conducted their oppo&s;ition in a way that ought to take all credit from it; the greate&s;t &s;trength of argument could neither have &s;o well de&s;erved, nor &s;o directly provoked, the u&s;e of violence, as the di&s;ingenuous arts which they have, in many in&s;tances, fearle&s;sly employed in &s;etting off very frivolous cavils, and the indecent &s;currility which they have indulged, when there was no &s;hadow of argument mixt with their abu&s;e. But attempts to re&s;train infidelity by force, hurt Chri&s;tianity in a way &s;till more direct and e&s;&s;ential, which I have principally in my eye. Suppo&s;e they &s;hould be effectual for hindering Infi|dels from at all propo&s;ing their objec|tions:
<PB N="496" REF="535">
this is the very utmo&s;t that could be expected from them: but would this really be of advantage to Chri&s;tia|nity? If the preceeding rea&s;onings be ju&s;t, it would not; it would on the contrary be prejudicial to it. It would prevent the evidence of this religion from ever &s;hining with that brightne&s;s which it has acquired by having &s;tood the &s;evere&s;t trial of rea&s;on, and which it could not po&s;&s;ibly have acquired by any other means. Infidels, tho' they intend far otherwi&s;e, are truly in&s;tru|ments in the hand of divine provi|dence, for the confirmation of Chri&s;ti|anity. If it be true, as we believe it is, all the attacks which can be made upon it, will infallibly i&s;&s;ue in render|ing its truth the more unque&s;tionable. No doubt they may produce very bad effects in the mean time: but the&s;e we have no authority from God, to pre|vent by methods of violence, and by
<PB N="497" REF="536">
&s;uch methods they cannot be in fact prevented. By betaking our&s;elves to them, we thereby ob&s;truct the good purpo&s;es to which infidelity will be o|verruled, without redre&s;&s;ing the tem|porary evils which immediately re&s;ult from it; we de&s;troy the wheat, with|out being able to root out the tares. That the acce&s;&s;ion of evidence which Chri&s;tianity acquires by &s;tanding the te&s;t of inquiry, may appear with the greate&s;t advantage, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the objections again&s;t it be propo&s;ed with as great &s;ecurity, as the arguments for it: without this, the trial which it &s;u&s;tains, is not ab&s;olutely fair; and, till the oppo&s;ite rea&s;ons be carefully bal|lanced, there is room left for a &s;u&s;pi|cion, that it has &s;u&s;tained the trial, not by the force of its truth alone, but partly al&s;o by the protection of human power. It is not every degree of re|&s;traint that will ju&s;tify this &s;u&s;picion;
<PB N="498" REF="537">
but it is pity that, by any degree of re&s;traint, a pretence was ever given for it. Let never Infidels be di&s;couraged from rea&s;oning freely again&s;t the evi|dences of Chri&s;tianity, as well as on o|ther &s;ubjects; their &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;onings again&s;t it, will do it the greate&s;t &s;er|vice; they will be like heroes, who&s;e bravery renders the victory more diffi|cult, but who&s;e captivity adds greatly to the &s;plendour of the triumph. If they even betake them&s;elves to cavils and mi&s;repre&s;entations, let the&s;e be on|ly pointed out with calmne&s;s; they will, in the end, not only di&s;grace their au|thors, but al&s;o hurt the cau&s;e which they were intended to &s;erve. Infideli|ty allowed to do its utmo&s;t, tends ulti|mately to de&s;troy it&s;elf, by making the truth of Chri&s;tianity to appear the more evident and unque&s;tionable. If then we really believe our religion to be of divine original, and be not under the
<PB N="499" REF="538">
power of a contracted and undi&s;cerning &s;pirit; concern for its &s;ucce&s;s, will con|cur with many other principles, in lead|ing us to wi&s;h mo&s;t earne&s;tly, that infi|delity may never be oppo&s;ed by any o|ther weapons, but that of ju&s;t rea&s;on|ing. Gold is <HI>refined</HI> in the furnace; it is only the worthle&s;s dro&s;s that is <HI>con|&s;umed;</HI> let Chri&s;tians never act as if they &s;u&s;pected their religion to be dro&s;s.
