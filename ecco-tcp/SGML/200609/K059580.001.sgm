<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE purpo&s;e of the&s;e pages is to trace the danger ari&s;ing from the uncon|trouled indulgence of &s;trong affections; not in tho&s;e in&s;tances where they lead to the guilty exce&s;&s;es of pa&s;&s;ion in a corrupted mind&mdash;but, when di&s;approved by rea&s;on, and uncircum|&s;cribed by prudence, they involve even the virtuous in calamity; &s;ince, under the domi|nion of pa&s;&s;ion, if the horror of remor&s;e may be avoided, mi&s;ery at lea&s;t is inevitable; and, though we do not become the &s;laves of vice, we mu&s;t yield our&s;elves the victims of &s;or|row.</P>
<P>The materials of the following &s;ketch are taken from nature. The perfection, how|ever, of a picture does not depend on the co|lours, but on the hand by which they are blended; and, perhaps, the pen which records
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
this narrative may, in vain, have attempted to re&s;cue it from oblivion.</P>
<P>I have been encouraged, by the indulgence which my former poems have met with, to inter&s;per&s;e &s;ome poetical pieces in the&s;e volumes; but the uncertainty of being able to engage the continuance of favour, leads me to offer the&s;e farther productions in ver&s;e, with as little confidence as this fir&s;t attempt in pro&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>AN Officer, to whom we &s;hall give the name of Clifford, derived from his ance&s;tors a very honourable de&s;cent, being able to trace their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an e&s;tate in the northern part of England thro' &s;everal centuries. That e&s;tate, however, was di&s;&s;i|pated by the imprudence and extravagance of his parents; and Captain Clifford, who had received a very liberal education, and was brought up with the expectation of an ample inheritance, found his only remain|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was his commi&s;&s;ion in the army. He married a beautiful young
<PB N="2" REF="5">
woman, the daughter of a neighbouring family, to whom he had been long attached, and who died a few years after their marriage, leaving him one daughter. To this child he transferred the tenderne&s;s he had felt for her mother, and undertook him&s;elf the charge of her education. Di&s;pirited by his dome&s;tic misfortune, wounded by the di&s;|appointment of his early views in life, and the mortification of &s;eeing many rai&s;ed a|bove him in the army, becau&s;e he was un|able to purcha&s;e promotion, he retired in di&s;gu&s;t, and lived upon a captain's half-pay, in a &s;mall village in the neighbourhood of London, where his father, who was far ad|vanced in years, made a part of his family.</P>
<P>In this retreat Captain Clifford found con&s;olation and employment, in devoting his time to the improvement of his daugh|ter; and his own mind being highly culti|vated, &s;he derived greater advantages from his in&s;tructions than &s;he could have receiv|ed from the mo&s;t expen&s;ive education, under a le&s;s anxious as well as a le&s;s able preceptor.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">
Nature had liberally be&s;towed upon Julia Clifford the powers of the under|&s;tanding, and the virtues of the heart: her &s;en&s;ibility was quick, her di&s;po&s;ition affec|tionate, and her ta&s;te was improved by the &s;ociety of her father, till it attained an un|common degree of elegance and refine|ment; but of her &s;uperiority to others &s;he &s;eemed intirely uncon&s;cious. Her manners were perfectly mode&s;t and una&s;&s;uming; her conver&s;ation &s;imple and un&s;tudied; &s;he &s;poke from the impul&s;e of her heart, and &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t amiable candor and frankne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition. Julia was above the middle &s;ize: her figure had not been much molded by the dancing-ma&s;ter; but nature had given it a gracefulne&s;s "be|yond the reach of art." She had a madona face, and an expre&s;&s;ion of intelligence and &s;en&s;ibility in her countenance, infinitely engaging.</P>
<P>Captain Clifford's younger brother, after the paternal e&s;tate was di&s;po&s;ed of, went in pur&s;uit of fortune to the Ea&s;t Indies
<PB N="4" REF="7">
&mdash;he was a man of a plain under&s;tanding and an excellent heart. Ju&s;t in his princi|ples, and generous in his di&s;po&s;ition, he acquired wealth &s;lowly, but honourably. Mr. Clifford married at Bengal, and his only daughter, Charlotte, was &s;ent when a child to England for education, and com|mitted to the care of her aunt Mrs. Mel|bourne, the &s;i&s;ter of Charlotte's mother.&mdash;At eighteen Charlotte was taken from &s;chool at Queen Square, to live with her aunt, till the return of her father from the Ea&s;t Indies. Charlotte was one of tho&s;e &s;weet lively characters, who&s;e unaffected manners and invariable good-humour &s;trongly engage the affections, and with whom one would wi&s;h to pa&s;s thro' life. The gay powers of wit and fancy are like tho&s;e brilliant phaenomena which &s;ome|times glow in the &s;ky, and dazzle the eye of the beholder by their luminous and un|common appearances; while &s;weetne&s;s of temper has a re&s;emblance to that gentle &s;tar, who&s;e benign influence gilds alike the morn|ing
<PB N="5" REF="8">
and the evening. But the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing and mo&s;t amiable trait of Charlotte's character, was her perfect exemption from envy. She was &s;en&s;ible of her inferiority to Julia, whom &s;he tenderly loved; and when|ever any preference was &s;hewn to her&s;elf &s;he &s;eemed con&s;cious of its inju&s;tice. Quite content to remain in the back-ground, &s;he embraced with the mo&s;t natural and lively plea&s;ure every opportunity of di&s;playing the accompli&s;hments of her cou&s;in.&mdash;Char|lotte was little, her features were not regu|lar, but her countenance had a very agree|able and animated expre&s;&s;ion. Her chief motive for rejoicing at her removal from &s;ehool, was the hope of a more frequent intercour&s;e with Julia, for her aunt had &s;mall hold on her affections.</P>
<P>Mrs. Melbourne's maiden name was Wil|&s;on&mdash;her father, who was an eminent mer|chant in the city, became a bankrupt when &s;he had ju&s;t attained her twenty-third year. A young man who had been her father's clerk, and was now married and engaged in a flou|ri&s;hing
<PB N="6" REF="9">
bu&s;ine&s;s, invited Mi&s;s Wil&s;on, from a principle of gratitude towards her fa|ther, to take up her re&s;idence at his hou&s;e, where his wife received her with great kindne&s;s. Meanwhile her younger &s;i&s;ter, who was then eighteen years of age, was fitted out at the expence of her re|lations, and &s;ent to the Ea&s;t Indies in pur&s;uit of a hu&s;band; or rather in &s;earch of the golden fleece, which is certainly the aim of &s;uch adventures, and the hu&s;|band is merely the means of attaining it.&mdash;The God of Love in the Ea&s;t frames his arrows of ma&s;&s;y gold; takes the fea|thers of his quiver not from the &s;oft wing of his mother's dove, but from the gaudy plumage of the peacock; and points all his &s;hafts with the bright edge of a diamond.&mdash;Mi&s;s Charlotte Wil&s;on was married &s;oon after her arrival in Bengal to Mr. Clifford, and died &s;ome years be|fore his return to England.</P>
<P>At the hou&s;e where Mi&s;s Wil&s;on found an a&s;ylum, Mr. Melbourne frequently vi&s;it|ed,
<PB N="7" REF="10">
the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e being his near relation.&mdash;He was a man of parts, and had attained con&s;iderable eminence in the law, a profe&s;&s;ion in which above all others emi|nence is honourable, &s;ince it is invariably connected with di&s;tinction of mind.&mdash;Mi&s;s Wil&s;on was tolerably hand&s;ome, and Mr. Melbourne paid her &s;ome attention: &s;he had an admirable degree of &s;agacity, and perceived that this young man, notwith|&s;tanding his &s;uperior under&s;tanding, was the dupe of vanity. She &s;oon betrayed the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion for him; and this di&s;play of fondne&s;s, which would probably have excited di&s;gu&s;t and aver&s;ion in a man of delicacy, had a very different effect on Mr. Melbourne. He was hand|&s;ome, and vain of his figure, as well as of his talents&mdash;he did not think it un|likely that he &s;hould in&s;pire a violent pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;Mi&s;s Wil&s;on appeared de&s;perate in her love; and he married her in good nature, and merely to prevent &s;uicide. Mrs. Melbourne continuing with great
<PB N="8" REF="11">
judgment to flatter his weakne&s;&s;es, he made her an excellent hu&s;band, and at his death left her a con&s;iderable jointure, and her daughter an independent fortune of twenty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Mrs. Melbourne had a large acquaint|ance, by whom &s;he was re&s;pected as a woman of &s;en&s;e, but not beloved; for her manners were &s;tiff and di&s;agreeable.&mdash;She gave &s;ome alms to the poor, becau&s;e &s;he thought a little charity was requi&s;ite to &s;ecure a good place in heaven; but &s;he found no duty more difficult, and wi&s;hed that any other had been enjoined in its place. "One cannot help pitying the unfor|tunate," (&s;he would exclaim) "and yet there is not one in a thou&s;and who is not &s;o in con&s;equence of imprudence; one mu&s;t therefore be &s;orry for the imprudent, or not &s;orry at all." She penetrated with nice di&s;cernment into the characters of her acquaintances; could perceive all their fol|lies, and de&s;cant upon them with great acutene&s;s;&mdash;no foible e&s;caped her accu|rate
<PB N="9" REF="12">
ob&s;ervation; and her friends met with none of that &s;pecies of partiality which &s;hades the weakne&s;&s;es of tho&s;e we love. Whenever her vi&s;itors departed, they were &s;ure of being analy&s;ed, and of having their defects weighed in a rigorous &s;cale, with|out the &s;lighte&s;t peculiarity being omit|ted. She had, indeed, too &s;trict a regard for truth to invent any &s;landers of her ac|quaintance. All Mrs. Melbourne could be charged with, was interpreting every word and action her own way, which was invariably the wor&s;t way po&s;&s;ible; and with great per&s;everance refu&s;ing to a&s;&s;ign a good motive for any thing, when a bad one could be found. She often remained &s;ilent in company, while &s;he was &s;toring her memory with materials for future ani|madver&s;ion; and Mrs. Melbourne's me|mory was like a bird of prey, which &s;eizes on &s;uch food as milder natures would re|ject. This lady was unfortunately quick in di&s;covering imperfection, but very lia|ble to overlook what was worthy of re|gard:
<PB N="10" REF="13">
&s;he left others to enjoy the flowers which are &s;cattered over the path of life, while &s;he employed her&s;elf in counting the weeds which grew among them. She might, indeed, have acknowledged with Iago, "that it was her nature's plague to &s;py into abu&s;es;" and might properly enough have added with him, that "oft her jealou&s;y &s;hap'd faults that were not." In her family Mrs. Melbourne was mo|ro&s;e and ill-humoured. She &s;colded her &s;ervants with little intermi&s;&s;ion, which &s;he con&s;idered an indi&s;pen&s;able part of the province of a good hou&s;ewife; and her &s;ervants, whom habit had reconciled to reproach, li&s;tened to her with the mo&s;t perfect indifference; as tho&s;e who live near the fall of a cataract, or on the banks of the ocean, hear at length the ru&s;hing of the torrent, or the rage of the billows, without being &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ounds. The only &s;ea&s;ons memorable for Mrs. Melbourne's tenderne&s;s were, when any of her connections or family were ill.
<PB N="11" REF="14">
She was then the mo&s;t courteous crea|ture exi&s;ting, and began to love them with all her might, as if &s;he thought there was no time to lo&s;e, and that &s;he mu&s;t endeavour to crowd &s;uch an extraordinary degree of fondne&s;s into the &s;hort &s;pace which was left, as might counterbalance her neglect or unkindne&s;s through the whole cour&s;e of their lives. The way to make her regard permanent was to die&mdash;her affection was violent when her friends came to the la&s;t ga&s;p; and after having &s;ettled the matter with her own con&s;cience by the&s;e parting demon&s;tra|tions of &s;orrow, &s;he &s;ubmitted with pious re&s;ignation to her lo&s;s. The ruling pa&s;|&s;ion of Mrs. Melbourne's &s;oul was her love of her daughter; but it was carried to an exce&s;s that rendered it illiberal and &s;elfi&s;h: her mind re&s;embled a convex gla&s;s, and every ray of affection in her bo&s;om was concentered in one &s;mall point. She con&s;idered every fine young woman as the rival of Mi&s;s Melbourne, and hated
<PB N="12" REF="15">
them in proportion as they merited re|gard. She could not forgive Julia for being young, beautiful, accompli&s;hed, and amiable, till her own daughter was mar|ried. After that period &s;he pardoned the&s;e intru&s;ive qualities; and at the re|que&s;t of Charlotte, upon her removal from &s;chool, invited Julia to &s;pend a &s;hort time at her hou&s;e in Hanover-&s;quare.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>JULIA di&s;covered at a very early age a particular &s;en&s;ibility to poetry. When &s;he was eight years old &s;he compo&s;ed a poem on the departure of one of her young companions, in which &s;he di&s;played, with great diligence, her whole &s;tock of cla&s;&s;ical knowledge; and obliged all the heathen gods and godde&s;&s;es, who&s;e names &s;he had been taught, to pa&s;s in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, like the &s;hades of Banquo's line. Her father did not di&s;courage this early fondne&s;s for the mu&s;e, becau&s;e he believed that a pro|pen&s;ity for any elegant art was a &s;ource of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Perhaps more la&s;ting reputation has been acquired by the powers of the ima|gination, than by any other faculty of the human mind. But even where the ta|lents
<PB N="14" REF="17">
of the poet are altogether inade|quate to the acqui&s;ition of fame, the cul|tivation of them may &s;till confer the mo&s;t &s;oothing enjoyment. Though the &s;oil may not be favourable to the growth of the immortal laurel, it may produce &s;ome plants of tran&s;itory verdure. Perhaps the mo&s;t precious property of poetry is, that of leading the mind from the gloomy mi&s;ts of care, or the black clouds of misfortune, which &s;ometimes gather round the path of life, to &s;cenes bright with &s;un&s;hine, and blooming with beauty.</P>
<P>We &s;hall venture to in&s;ert the follow|ing Addre&s;s to Poetry, written by Julia a &s;hort time before her vi&s;it to town, as a proof of her fondne&s;s for that charming art.</P>

<P>JULIA, for the fir&s;t time, accepted with plea&s;ure Mrs. Melbourne's invi|tation; for her former vi&s;its to that lady had been productive only of wearine&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t. She had always been treated by Mi&s;s Melbourne with great neglect, and by her mo&s;t intimate companions, the Hon. Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s, with particular rude|ne&s;s. Mi&s;s Melbourne had di&s;cernment enough to perceive Julia's merit, and, had &s;he been more obliged to fortune, and le&s;s to nature, would have valued her acquaint|ance highly; but no honour could have been gained with people of <HI>ton,</HI> by an in|timacy with one in Julia's &s;ituation; while, at the &s;ame time, her engaging qualities would have been perpetually in the way, and obtruded them&s;elves in a manner very
<PB N="26" REF="29">
trouble&s;ome to Mi&s;s Melbourne. Her bo&s;om friends, the Hon. Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s, had an unconquerable antipathy to female beauty: they agreed with many wi&s;e men in the opinion, that beauty often proves fatal to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; but, notwith&s;tand|ing this conviction, the&s;e ladies had the magnanimity to wi&s;h that this dangerous property had been entirely confined to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t of the&s;e &s;i&s;ters, who had ju&s;t reached her twenty-eighth year, had al&s;o an in&s;uperable aver&s;ion to the age of nineteen. Julia, therefore, who had the accumulated misfortune of being beautiful, and ju&s;t nineteen, was the object of general di&s;like to the&s;e ladies. The Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s, who were of all Mrs. Melbourne's parties, u&s;ually placed them&s;elves in a corner of the room with Mi&s;s Melbourne, and found amu&s;ement in laughing at the re&s;t of the company as they entered. When any gentleman approached their circle, the laugh was increa&s;ed; for they were of that
<PB N="27" REF="30">
order of young ladies who, having heard of the attractions of &s;prightline&s;s, affect perpetual mirth, and fancy that vivacity con&s;i&s;ts in a titter, and wit in a pert re|mark: yet it was ea&s;y to di&s;cern that their gaiety was artificial, becau&s;e it was always beyond what the occa&s;ion ju&s;tified. It re&s;embled tho&s;e flowers which are rear|ed in winter by the force of art, and are de&s;titute of that delicious fragrance which nature only can be&s;tow. Mi&s;s Melbourne and the Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s had long been on a very intimate footing, profe&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t violent mutual regard, and were common|ly called friends: yet this intimacy, which was dignified with the name of friend&s;hip, had no other foundation than &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; for, had Mi&s;s Melbourne renounced her balls and concerts, or the Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s been deprived of their rank, this &s;enti|mental intercour&s;e would in&s;tantly have terminated: mean while their affection appeared fervent, becau&s;e it was untried; and durable, becau&s;e it was yet un&s;haken
<PB N="28" REF="31">
by misfortune. Mi&s;s Melbourne was late|ly married; the vi&s;its of the Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s were therefore no longer frequent at her mother's hou&s;e; and Julia looked for|ward to nothing but plea&s;ure in the &s;o|ciety of the affectionate and amiable Char|lotte. She al&s;o promi&s;ed her&s;elf a new kind of gratification, in mixing for awhile with the gay and elegant parties at Mr. Seymour's, the gentleman whom Mi&s;s Melbourne had married, and who indulged her in her fondne&s;s for &s;plendor and di&s;|&s;ipation.&mdash;Nature, who had been avari|cious of the qualities of ta&s;te and &s;en&s;i|bility to Mrs. Melbourne, had given an accumulated portion of both to her daugh|ter, together with more than an hereditary &s;hare of beauty. She was a painter and a mu&s;ician; but her vanity perverted every natural and acquired talent, "grew with her growth, and &s;trengthened with her &s;trength," and kept pace with her un|der&s;tanding and accompli&s;hments. Va|nity made her &s;elfi&s;h; for &s;he was &s;o extra|vagantly
<PB N="29" REF="32">
fond of admiration, that, in the continual pur&s;uit of it, &s;he could think only of her&s;elf, and forgot all the claims of others. But &s;he felt that &s;entiment was amiable; &s;he was, therefore, made up of &s;entiment:&mdash;&s;he al&s;o knew, that per&s;ons of refinement were often, from the wayward circum&s;tances of life, ex|tremely mi&s;erable; &s;he, therefore, deemed di&s;content the te&s;t of feeling, and, with &s;carcely a wi&s;h ungratified, &s;he thought that to be happy, with what would make any vulgar mind happy, would be only proving that &s;he was dull.&mdash;She &s;poke, therefore, in a plaintive voice, and often complained of melancholy, but left the cau&s;e of it concealed; which was &s;uch as no under&s;tanding could penetrate, and no heart could gue&s;s. Sometimes, indeed, &s;he &s;miled, while &s;he de&s;canted, in well|cho&s;en words, on what was weak, low, or ridiculous; but the pen&s;ive ca&s;t of coun|tenance quickly returned, and an affected &s;igh explained the difficulty &s;he felt in a&s;|&s;uming
<PB N="30" REF="33">
gaiety. If &s;he carved at table, or made tea, &s;he did both with a &s;ort of &s;low and &s;olemn movement, to convince the company that &s;he was in a frame of mind, from which it co&s;t her a cruel effort to de&s;cend to the common offices of life. She &s;eemed to think eating a coar&s;e and vulgar toil; and her conver&s;ation frequent|ly wandered from a roa&s;ted duck to Mi|nerva's owl, or Jove's eagle. She could not hear an Italian air without weeping; &s;he pitied the mi&s;eries of the poor in very pathetic language; and lamented being obliged, in conformity to her &s;ituation in life, to &s;pend much more than &s;he wi&s;h|ed upon dre&s;s, which put it out of her power, in the account of her annual ex|pences, to reckon the claims of benevo|lence, and confined her to a negative &s;ort of good-will towards the unfortunate. Yet &s;he often declared, that &s;he complied with the rules of fa&s;hion, merely becau&s;e &s;he thought &s;uch compliance fit and right. If Mrs. Seymour's notions on this &s;ubject were
<PB N="31" REF="34">
ju&s;t, and conformity to fa&s;hion is virtue, how exten&s;ive was her merit! how upright had been the pa&s;t, how perfect was the pre&s;ent, and how certain was the pro&s;pect of future excellence!&mdash;But &s;he did not recollect that it is ea&s;y to di&s;cern whether the motive from which we act be duty or inclination; our obedience is &s;o much more exact in the one ca&s;e than in the other. If &s;he had been &s;wayed &s;olely by the former principle, there would pro|bably have been &s;ometimes a little re|laxation in the labours of the toilet; nor would every ribbon and feather have been placed in &s;uch unque&s;tionable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the la&s;t mode.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Seymour received com|pany, &s;he advanced to meet them not with the plea&s;ure which kindne&s;s or affec|tion dictates. She &s;poke to her vi&s;itors as if &s;he were intere&s;ted in what &s;he &s;aid, but &s;he &s;carcely knew what it was. She was not thinking of the per&s;ons who had ju&s;t entered: her concern was that her
<PB N="32" REF="35">
manner of receiving them might be thought graceful by the &s;pectators. She was &s;carcely ever at home, but &s;pent her time in lamenting, wherever &s;he went, the fatigues of a large acquaintance. She impo&s;ed upon her&s;elf the duty of going to every ball, or card-a&s;&s;embly, to which &s;he was invited; but performed the riga|doon &s;tep, and dealt the cards, with &s;en|timental pen&s;ivene&s;s, and as if &s;he were fully per&s;uaded that dancing was vanity, and whi&s;t vexation of &s;pirit. Her com|plaints, however gracefully delivered, were often ill timed: &s;he would invite a &s;ocial party to dinner, and then, in&s;tead of pro|moting chearfulne&s;s and good-humour, be langui&s;hingly mournful the whole day. The nightingale judges better than Mrs. Seymour did, for <HI>&s;he</HI> never begins her elegies of woe amid&s;t the fre&s;hne&s;s of the morning, and the lu&s;tre of a bright ho|rizon, when we would rather li&s;ten to the rapture of the lark; but waits till the fading &s;cenery, and the melancholy
<PB N="33" REF="36">
of twilight, &s;hall di&s;po&s;e us for a dirge. But in truth, though Mrs. Seymour af|fected the plaintive notes of the nightin|gale, &s;he had no congenial ta&s;te with that pathetic bird for the &s;hade, but was as fond of &s;un&s;hine as the lark him&s;elf.</P>

<P>ON her arrival in town, Julia expre&s;&s;ed a great de&s;ire to go to the theatre; and Mrs. Seymour engaged a box at Drury-lane for the next evening, when the tragedy of Douglas was performed. Julia admired with enthu&s;ia&s;m that charm|ing play, which never "over&s;teps the mo|de&s;ty of nature," and is &s;o true to her genuine feelings; but which had not, till &s;ome years after this period, its full effect upon the heart, in having the part of Lady Randolph repre&s;ented by Mrs. Sid|dons, who&s;e power over the human pa&s;|&s;ions it is far more ea&s;y to feel than to delineate.</P>
<P>Julia and her cou&s;in went to dinner at Mrs. Seymour's, and were anxious to reach the theatre before the performance
<PB N="35" REF="38">
began: Mrs. Seymour affected to wi&s;h &s;o too; but, after the carriage came, &s;he found &s;o many pretences for delay, that the fir&s;t act was almo&s;t over before they reached their box. This was what Mrs. Seymour de&s;ired: &s;he cho&s;e to excite at|tention by di&s;turbing the performance, and drawing the looks of the audience from the &s;tage to her&s;elf. When &s;he was &s;eated, &s;he began talking to Julia with great &s;eeming earne&s;tne&s;s, who was too much engaged by the &s;cene before her to pay attention to Mrs. Seymour's remarks; and indeed that lady did not de&s;ire it: her whole mind was occupied in per|forming her own part gracefully, while &s;he remained an object of general ob&s;er|vation. She &s;poke to be <HI>looked at,</HI> not to be <HI>heard</HI>; and her lips moved, or were &s;till, from no other impul&s;e than as &s;he thought &s;peech or &s;ilence would have the be&s;t effect in per&s;pective.</P>
<P>Julia and Charlotte &s;oon became deep|ly ab&s;orbed in the &s;orrows of Lady Ran|dolph,
<PB N="36" REF="39">
and their tears flowed often and irre&s;i&s;tibly. Mrs. Seymour now thought proper to di&s;play her &s;en&s;ibility too, of which &s;he really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable &s;hare; but in her eagerne&s;s to di&s;cover her feelings in the mo&s;t pathetic parts, to &s;hew her admiration of the fine&s;t pa&s;|&s;ages, and to weep at the preci&s;e mo|ment when it would do her ta&s;te mo&s;t honour, &s;he lo&s;t the charm of the illu&s;ion; and her &s;ympathy was &s;o interrupted by her vanity, that at length &s;he could &s;carce|ly force a tear; and all that was left in her power, was to lean in a pen&s;ive atti|tude on the &s;ide of the box, and a&s;&s;ume a look of dejection.</P>
<P>The next day Julia went with Mrs. Melbourne and Charlotte to dine at Mrs. Seymour's, where a large company was a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>Mr. Seymour's was a hou&s;e of &s;how, rather than of ho&s;pitality; a hou&s;e where o&s;tentatious entertainments were occa&s;ion|ally given with the mo&s;t lavi&s;h expence,
<PB N="37" REF="40">
but where no intimate gue&s;ts were led by friend&s;hip, and detained by kindne&s;s; for that cordial welcome which &s;prings from the heart, was in this family neither under&s;tood nor practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The company were obliged to wait dinner &s;ome time for Mr. Charles Sey|mour, who was always too late by rule, which he very methodically ob&s;erved. Mr. Charles Seymour was the younge&s;t brother of Mr. Seymour, and had, thro' his intere&s;t, obtained a place at court. He was a young man of weak under|&s;tanding, but he made up in pliability and fine&s;&s;e, what he wanted in good &s;en&s;e. His per&s;on was genteel, he had acquired a graceful ea&s;e of manner, danced well, dre&s;&s;ed with elegance, court|ed the great by all tho&s;e little attentions which only little minds can pay, and was rewarded for his a&s;&s;iduity by fre|quent invitations to &s;plendid and fa&s;hion|able parties. He was a young man who&s;e acquaintance every lady, when &s;he gave a
<PB N="38" REF="41">
ball, was proud to acknowledge, and happy to embrace; for he &s;eemed made on purpo&s;e for &s;uch an occa&s;ion, and, whenever it occurred, was found a trea|&s;ure to &s;ociety; for he was the leader of cotillons, the example of fa&s;hion, and the oracle of etiquette.</P>
<P>The company who now waited for him at his brother's hou&s;e, began to appear tired. The gentlemen had fini&s;hed the politics of the day, and the ladies had di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the &s;ubject of the opera; be&s;ides having de&s;canted for a con&s;iderable time on the complexion, features, age, per&s;on, voice, and manners of a young lady, who had the week before made a great marriage, to which the Hon. Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s in&s;i&s;t|ed &s;he had not the &s;malle&s;t preten&s;ion. Fa&s;hionable conver&s;ation is not very ex|ten&s;ive: it goes on rapidly for a while, in a certain routine of topics, and reminds us of our &s;treet-mu&s;icians, who, by turn|ing a &s;crew, produce a &s;et of tunes on the hand-organ; but when they have gone
<PB N="39" REF="42">
through a limited number, the in&s;trument will do no more, and the performer ha&s;|tens to a di&s;tant &s;treet, where the &s;ame &s;ounds may be repeated to a new &s;et of auditors.</P>
<P>Mr. Seymour, with &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure, rang the bell for dinner, and at that mo|ment Mr. Charles Seymour was announ|ced. He heard with the mo&s;t polite non|chalance, that he had kept the company waiting, muttering however &s;omething be|tween his teeth of his having been parti|cularly hurried that morning.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation at dinner opened a new fund of knowledge to Julia. She found that among the fa&s;hionable world eating had become a &s;cience. The gen|tlemen were all &s;killed in the complicated art of cookery, talked in a deci&s;ive tone of the proper flavour of every di&s;h, di&s;cri|minated with the nice&s;t accuracy the dif|ferent ingredients of the &s;auces, devoured each other's remarks with "greedy ear," and &s;eemed to take as much heart-felt &s;a|tisfaction
<PB N="40" REF="43">
in the delineation of a rago&ucirc;t, as "if to live well, meant nothing but to eat."</P>
<P>The ladies left a di&s;&s;ertation on French wines unfini&s;hed, and returned to the drawing-room. Mrs. Seymour ordered coffee, and the gentlemen &s;oon followed. Mr. Seymour, who was much charmed with Julia, though he had no lei&s;ure for admiration at dinner, began a conver&s;a|tion with her, which &s;he found extremely agreeable, and which promi&s;ed her &s;ome compen&s;ation for all &s;he had heard of ra|go&ucirc;ts, and French wines; but which was almo&s;t immediately interrupted by the ar|rival of Mrs. Melbourne's carriage; who in&s;tantly hurried away to a card-a&s;&s;embly, followed by Charlotte and Julia, who, as &s;he went down &s;tairs, could not help re|peating to her&s;elf, with the author of the Epi&s;tle to Spleen,
<Q><L>Defend us, ye kind gods! tho' &s;inners,</L>
<L>From many days like this, or dinners.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="44">
The week following, Mrs. Seymour gave a dance. The &s;plendor of the apart|ments, elegantly decorated, and illumi|nated; the gaiety of the company, the chearfulne&s;s of mu&s;ic, and the animation of dancing, were all highly delightful to Julia, to whom &s;uch &s;cenes had the charm of novelty. She was much admired, and was a&s;ked to dance by &s;ome young men of rank, whom the Hon. Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s had in their own minds appropriated to them&s;elves. This was at once &s;o morti|fying, and &s;o &s;trange, that the Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s wi&s;hed there were no &s;uch en|tertainment as a ball; or at lea&s;t, that the men had no &s;uch impertinent privilege as a choice of partners, &s;ince they were &s;o apt to chu&s;e ill, and make the evening di&s;|agreeable.

<P>Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, the gentleman who paid

Julia the mo&s;t marked attention, was a man of family and fortune, as well as of con&s;iderable talents; and was a parti|cular favourite with Mrs. Seymour, who valued &s;uperior abilities when they were united with fortune, and could be found within that fa&s;hionable circle, beyond the limits of which no promi&s;e of intellectual enjoyment could have tempted her to &s;tray; for &s;he could perceive no beauty in the gems of wit or fancy, unle&s;s their light was thrown from a particular &s;itua|tion, and blended with the lu&s;tre of wealth. Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> was intirely occu|pied by Julia, and perfectly in&s;en&s;ible of Mrs. Seymour's mortification; who &s;ecret|ly re&s;olved not to invite that young lady the next time &s;he gave a dance. She came frequently to that part of the room where Julia was &s;itting, and &s;poke to her oftener than was nece&s;&s;ary, when &s;o large a company required her attention. She tried to catch the tone of Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s mind, advanced with a pen&s;ive air when
<PB N="43" REF="46">
&s;he &s;aw him look &s;erious, and dre&s;&s;ed her face in &s;miles when &s;he ob&s;erved that he was conver&s;ing with gaiety. The&s;e tran|&s;itions &s;he performed with admirable &s;kill; but, far from producing the effect &s;he de&s;ired, they were not even ob&s;erved by the per&s;on to whom they were direct|ed. With inexpre&s;&s;ible chagrin &s;he per|ceived, that when Julia danced with any other per&s;on, Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> &s;at down and contemplated her figure. Mrs. Seymour felt the tears of vexation fill her eyes; &s;he had never met with any incident &s;o provoking; there is &s;urely, thought &s;he, a perver&s;e and contradictive &s;pirit in man, which makes the whole &s;ex odious. Any evening but this, &s;he would have for|given Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">; but to choo&s;e her own ball-room for the theatre of her morti|fication, was refining on ill-nature. Any evening but this, &s;he would have attri|buted his preference of Julia to &s;ome ne|glect of her own per&s;on; an unbecoming cap, or too pale a ribbon: but on this
<PB N="44" REF="47">
occa&s;ion there was no &s;uch refuge for her vanity; for &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t &s;tudied elegance, and rouged with the mo&s;t careful delicacy. She recalled the general idea of her own figure in the looking-gla&s;s after the labours of the toilet were fini&s;hed, and found no room for &s;elf-reproach on account of inattention to her appearance. Her retentive me|mory then traced each particular part of her dre&s;s, the po&s;ture of every curl, the arrangement of every flower, and the flow of every feather, and found no &s;ubject of di&s;&s;atisfaction even in this minute retro|&s;pection. She well remembered that no toil had been omitted, no time had been &s;pared, nothing overlooked, or unfini&s;hed: her aim had been perfection, and her ef|forts were proportionably arduous to at|tain it. She determined, however, to hide her real &s;en&s;ations under the ap|pearance of particular gaiety: &s;he danced continually, and laughed exce&s;&s;ively when|ever &s;he came within &s;ight or hearing of
<PB N="45" REF="48">
Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, though &s;he would much rather have cried, if &s;he had thought crying would have &s;uited her purpo&s;e as well.</P>
<P>Whenever Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> was not a&s;ked to dance by a man of fa&s;hion, &s;he &s;ud|denly grew tired, and cho&s;e to &s;it down; where &s;he remained with inquietude in her looks, and &s;pite in her conver&s;ation. What &s;o wretched as a neglected beauty of the <HI>ton,</HI> when the gay images of co|ronets, titles, and equipages, which have long floated in her imagination, and &s;eemed within her gra&s;p, at length vani&s;h, as the luxuriant colours of an evening &s;ky fade by degrees into the &s;adne&s;s of twilight? Her feelings are more acute than tho&s;e of a lo&s;ing game&s;ter, as &s;he is compelled in &s;ecret to acknowledge &s;ome deficiency in her own powers of attrac|tion, to ca&s;t an oblique reflection on na|ture, as well as fortune, and has no hope of retrieving her di&s;appointments, &s;ince the fairies have long ago u&s;ed every drop of
<PB N="46" REF="49">
that precious water which could renew expiring beauty.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> was &s;eated for a &s;hort time next Julia, and began to relate anecdotes to the di&s;advantage of &s;ome of the com|pany pre&s;ent, with whom &s;he appeared to be on a footing of great cordiality: anec|dotes of this kind &s;he was careful to col|lect, and happy not merely to detail but embelli&s;h. This lady had &s;ome powers of ridicule, and could &s;prinkle over her di&s;|cour&s;e a little &s;mart repartee, which many people mi&s;took for talents. She delighted to play at quart and tierce in conver&s;ation; but her weapons were very blunt, compar|ed to the fine-edged in&s;truments of ge|nuine wit. Julia, however, made it an invariable rule, not only never to &s;peak &s;lander, but never to li&s;ten to it. She con&s;idered it as one of tho&s;e poi&s;ons, which not only corrode the frame they touch, but who&s;e &s;ubtile venom infects the purity of the &s;urrounding air: &s;he therefore fled from &s;uch communication
<PB N="47" REF="50">
with di&s;gu&s;t, and obliged Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> to go in &s;earch of a more willing auditor.</P>
<P>Mr. Charles Seymour danced with the Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s mo&s;t indefatigably, went with unwearied per&s;everance from one &s;i&s;ter to the other, and divided his atten|tions between them with mo&s;t exact pro|priety; repeated to each of them all the fa&s;hionable cant he had acquired; laughed when they laughed, and was of the &s;ame opinion with them on every &s;ubject; mut|tering every &s;yllable with his teeth almo&s;t clo&s;ed, and his face as clo&s;e to his fair partners as propriety would admit. When he had fulfilled his duty to the Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s, he deliberated with him&s;elf upon the next object of his choice, which re|quired a little reflection. Mr. Charles Seymour admired beauty, but he was one of tho&s;e prudent young men, who are too well trained in the &s;chool of the world, to be the dupes of any tender &s;en&s;ibility. He cho&s;e his partners at a dance by other rules than the proportion of their features,
<PB N="48" REF="51">
or the grace of their per&s;ons: the darts poured from bright eyes fell blunted on his heart, unle&s;s the fair object had the more &s;olid recommendation of fortune. To &s;uch only he devoted his gallantry; for even when he had no particular view of engaging their regard, he con&s;idered their acquaintance as u&s;eful, and their fa|vour as tending towards the accompli&s;h|ment of his ultimate aim in life, which was to acquire di&s;tinction, and obtain in|tere&s;t in the fa&s;hionable world.</P>
<P>Charlotte had the pro&s;pect of a larger fortune than any young woman at the dance, but then it depended on certain contingencies. The other young women had their property in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Mr. Charles Seymour, after making a ha&s;ty calculation of the difference between a hundred thou&s;and pounds at Bengal, and ten thou&s;and in the bank of England&mdash;af|ter gliding in imagination over the bound|le&s;s ocean through which the gold mu&s;t pa&s;s, con&s;idering the &s;tormy Cape which
<PB N="49" REF="52">
mu&s;t be doubled, and the "moving acci|dents by flood and field" which mu&s;t be hazarded&mdash;at length recollected how much ea&s;tern gold had happily &s;urmount|ed the&s;e perils, and, without farther deli|beration, decided in favour of Charlotte. He endeavoured to entertain her in the &s;ame manner he had done the Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s; but Charlotte was equally in|&s;en&s;ible to all his fa&s;hionable grimace, and indifferent to his conver&s;ation. She had, indeed, the happie&s;t face of the whole group; plea&s;ure and exultation &s;parkled in her eyes. Her manner of thinking on the &s;ubject of a ball was entirely different from that of the Hon. Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s: Charlotte loved dancing for its own &s;ake, and without any other care about her partner than that he did not put her out in the figure. She allowed her&s;elf no in|terval of re&s;t; for &s;he was never &s;o fully convinced of the value of time as at a ball, where &s;he thought not one moment was given to be lo&s;t, and pur&s;ued her fa|vourite
<PB N="50" REF="53">
occupation with a degree of de|light, of which one mu&s;t have the ex|treme youth, the gay &s;pirits, and light heart of Charlotte to judge.</P>
<P>Julia, who frequently &s;at down, heard &s;everal of the gentlemen complain pathe|tically to each other of the hard&s;hips of dancing, and enumerate the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of private balls, which hung over their future evenings like a cloud. Mr. Charles Sey|mour avoided Julia carefully the whole evening, le&s;t he &s;hould be under the nece&s;|&s;ity of a&s;king her to dance: but when he &s;aw her preparing to go away, he &s;eated him&s;elf next her, muttering between his teeth, "Mi&s;s Clifford, you come <HI>&s;o</HI> late, and go away <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;oon!"&mdash;adding, how beautiful &s;he looked that evening, how much her head-dre&s;s became her, and how cruel &s;he was to bury &s;uch a figure in the country.&mdash;Julia heard him with a degree of contempt, which &s;he had too much &s;weetne&s;s to di&s;play; but his con|ver&s;ation ever appeared to her of &s;uch a
<PB N="51" REF="54">
barren nature, that &s;he con&s;idered li&s;tening to it like travelling over &s;ands, and left him almo&s;t immediately; which was no le&s;s a relief to him than to her&s;elf. Julia had that evening received much enter|tainment from Mr. Seymour's conver&s;a|tion, who paid her great attention, and was endued with the powers of plea&s;ing in a very eminent degree.</P>

<P>MR. Seymour, who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;iderable talents, and great ta&s;te for literature, was brilliant in conver&s;a|tion. His per&s;on was elegant, and his manners frank and agreeable. He had a perfect knowledge of the world, and great penetration into character; but his am|bition was boundle&s;s; and his con&s;tant aim was his own aggrandizement: he courted people of rank and influence with admirable addre&s;s; and, under an appear|ance of infinite candour and plainne&s;s, was no common flatterer, who &s;ets about his bu&s;ine&s;s in a clum&s;y way, and di&s;|covers his own &s;ecret. He had judg|ment enough to appreciate the under|&s;tanding of others with nicety, and always began his operations like a wi&s;e general,
<PB N="53" REF="56">
by an attack on the weak &s;ide. Mr. Seymour lived in a continual plot again&s;t the re&s;t of his &s;pecies&mdash;he regarded men and women as puppets moved by various &s;prings, which he under&s;tood perfectly how to govern, and which he could touch &s;o &s;kilfully, that wi&s;dom was over-reached as well as folly. His &s;chemes were crown|ed with &s;ucce&s;s, and he obtained a con&s;i|derable po&s;t under government: yet his pride and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s were &s;till un&s;atisfied. He had married Mi&s;s Melbourne, who&s;e per&s;on he did not admire, and who&s;e cha|racter he di&s;liked, becau&s;e &s;he had twenty thou&s;and pounds. No man could talk with more energy of the virtues of gene|ro&s;ity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s than Mr. Sey|mour; and this not with an appearance of o&s;tentation, but as if friend&s;hip and univer&s;al good-will were the genuine feelings of his &s;oul. Yet, while he thus de&s;canted on benevolence, he concealed a mind, the &s;ole view of which was &s;elf|intere&s;t; and &s;ometimes reminded tho&s;e
<PB N="54" REF="57">
who knew his real character, of a &s;wan gracefully expanding his plumes of pure&s;t whitene&s;s to the winds, and carefully hid|ing his black feet beneath another ele|ment. Mr. Seymour po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;trong feelings, and his heart was capable of tenderne&s;s; but ambition, and long com|merce with the world, had almo&s;t entirely blunted his &s;en&s;ibility; and, to the few per&s;ons for whom he &s;till felt &s;ome affec|tion, he would not have rendered any &s;ervice, however e&s;&s;ential to their intere&s;t, which could in the &s;malle&s;t po&s;&s;ible de|gree ever interfere with his own. His friend&s;hip was only to be procured by be&s;towing favours upon him, or at lea&s;t by not requiring any at his hands: to a&s;k for &s;uch proofs of his regard was to forfeit it altogether. Every acquaintance he made was with &s;ome intere&s;ted view: he had no a&s;&s;ociates among the com|panions of his youth, except tho&s;e who, like him&s;elf, had been pro&s;perous in the career of life: the unfortunate he left
<PB N="55" REF="58">
where misfortune had placed them, and &s;hunned all intercour&s;e with them care|fully. He treated Mrs. Seymour with decent attention; but he was a man of gallantry, and made love to every woman who had the attraction of youth or beau|ty; and Mrs. Seymour, when &s;he thought the heroics would become her, acted a fit of jealou&s;y admirably; complained in pathetic terms of his indifference; la|mented her hard fate in not having met with a congenial &s;oul, and in being &s;ubject to have her exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility &s;o cruelly wounded. From &s;uch complaints he fled with di&s;gu&s;t and aver&s;ion, and took refuge in company, where he contributed too much to the general entertainment not to be received with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Julia, after &s;pending a few days more in town, left it with little regret; for, tho' &s;he was convinced that London furni&s;hed a more enlarged and liberal &s;ociety, and more elegant amu&s;ements, than could be met with el&s;ewhere, the manner in which
<PB N="56" REF="59">
&s;he had pa&s;&s;ed her time was not at all &s;uited to her ta&s;te. The mornings had been generally devoted to &s;hopping and dre&s;s, and the evenings to card-a&s;&s;em|blies. Mrs. Seymour loved to range from one milliner's to another; and at fir&s;t Julia was diverted with the &s;erious air with which a cap is recommended, the contemplative &s;pirit with which the complexion and the ribbon are compared; while &s;he ob&s;erved the particular good-humour of the hand&s;ome, who found every thing they tried becoming, and the di&s;content of the ugly, who quarrelled with the head-dre&s;s in&s;tead of the face: but the good-humour, and the di&s;content, became at length equally tire&s;ome to Ju|lia. She al&s;o found that the plea&s;ures of card-a&s;&s;emblies were like fairy gold, which, when touched by a vulgar hand, turns to du&s;t, and could only be enjoyed by people of <HI>ton</HI>; while to her, who had acquired no knowledge of cards, and no pa&s;&s;ion for a crowd, &s;uch meetings were extremely
<PB N="57" REF="60">
weari&s;ome. At the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies &s;he was introduced to &s;ome per&s;ons who had the reputation of wit and talents; but of their preten&s;ions to either &s;he had no oppor|tunity of judging, &s;ince their conver&s;a|tion, to which &s;he li&s;tened with avidity, was continually interrupted by &s;ome movement of the crowd, or &s;ome call to the card-table. She therefore found that under&s;tanding was of no current value at a card-a&s;&s;embly, except to &s;erve the pur|po&s;e of applying the rules of whi&s;t, a &s;cience for which her country education had taught her but little reverence.</P>
<P>This young lady lamented nothing &s;o much in leaving London, as her &s;epara|tion from Charlotte; for &s;he found that the joys of di&s;&s;ipation are like gaudy co|lours, which for a moment attract the &s;ight, but &s;oon fatigue and oppre&s;s it; while the &s;atisfactions of home re&s;emble the green robe of nature, on which the eye loves to re&s;t, and to which it always returns with a &s;en&s;ation of delight.</P>

<P>IT has been mentioned, that Captain Clifford's father made a part of his fa|mily. This old man, who was heir to an e&s;tate which had de&s;cended to him through a long line of ance&s;tors, had re|ceived a very liberal education, was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a good under&s;tanding, and a mo&s;t benevolent heart. In truth, his li|berality was carried to exce&s;s, and he practi&s;ed that profu&s;e ho&s;pitality which was the fa&s;hion of the la&s;t century. Every gue&s;t was received at his hou&s;e with the welcome of ancient times, and both his pur&s;e and his table were open to all tho&s;e who&s;e nece&s;&s;ities &s;eemed to claim his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>His e&s;tate was a little incumbered, when he came to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. He
<PB N="59" REF="62">
had engaged early in a military life, and &s;erved long abroad, while his affairs were left too much to the management of his wife, a woman of unbounded vanity, who vied in expence with families po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much larger e&s;tates. She died &s;uddenly, in the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band; who, at his re|turn from Germany, found that her debts were numerous, and that he had lo&s;t a very con&s;iderable &s;um, for which, in the con|fidence of un&s;u&s;picious friend&s;hip, he be|came an&s;werable for one, who&s;e principles he con&s;idered as no le&s;s honourable than his own. He was undeceived too late. The world will blame his imprudence, and think he de&s;erved to &s;uffer from it: but, while fore&s;ight and policy are &s;o com|mon, let us forgive tho&s;e few minds of tru&s;ting &s;implicity, who are taught in vain the le&s;&s;on of &s;u&s;picion, on whom impre&s;|&s;ions are ea&s;ily made, and who think bet|ter of human nature than it de&s;erves. Such per&s;ons are for the mo&s;t part &s;uf|ficiently puni&s;hed for their venial error,
<PB N="60" REF="63">
as was the ca&s;e with Mr. Clifford, who was forced to extricate him&s;elf from the difficulties in which he was involved by the &s;ale of his paternal inheritance.</P>
<P>With a degree of angui&s;h which can be better felt than de&s;cribed, he had quitted for ever a &s;pot endeared to him by every tie of local attachment, and every feeling of family pride. He flew for refuge to his &s;on, and implored his forgivene&s;s of the wrongs he had done him: he was re|ceived with all the tenderne&s;s of filial re|gard. Captain Clifford &s;tudied, by the mo&s;t delicate attentions, to &s;often the gloom and de&s;pondency of his father's mind: and at length the old man became &s;oothed into a le&s;s painful recollection of the pa&s;t, though at times it wrung his heart with &s;orrow.</P>
<P>The endearments of his grand-daughter, who had then reached her &s;eventh year, gave him a plea&s;ure mingled with &s;ad|ne&s;s; and often, when &s;he climbed upon his knees, the old man's tears would
<PB N="61" REF="64">
fall upon her face; for age had not yet dried their &s;ource. Yet his temper was naturally cheerful, and in happier mo|ments he would &s;ing to her &s;ome of his old &s;ongs, or tell her &s;ome marvellous &s;tory; and, when &s;he was old enough to li&s;ten to the tale of his battles in Ger|many, he "&s;hewed how fields were won." Nor was he ever &s;o eloquent as when he gave the&s;e de&s;criptions: his lan|guage became animated, his martial en|thu&s;iam revived, and all the misfortunes of his pa&s;t life were ab&s;orbed in the gratify|ing recollection of having &s;erved his king and country.</P>
<P>This old man had infinite benevolence and &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, and was one of tho&s;e few aged per&s;ons who rejoice in the happine&s;s of the young. To witne&s;s the mirth and gaiety of youth, was to him a renovation of tho&s;e &s;cenes "where once his carele&s;s childhood &s;trayed, a &s;tranger yet to pain." In con&s;equence of this di&s;|po&s;ition, he was adored by Julia, and be|loved
<PB N="62" REF="65">
by all her companions. As &s;he grew up, &s;he was ever ready to &s;acrifice every wi&s;h, and every plea&s;ure, to his ea&s;e and comfort. She would leave with ala|crity a circle of company where &s;he was happy, to return home, and read for an hour to her grandfather in the old family bible, with a long expo&s;ition; of which he liked to hear a portion every evening. I think I &s;ee her at this moment; her chair drawn quite clo&s;e to his, and her voice rai&s;ed, becau&s;e he heard with dif|ficulty. I &s;ee the old man, placed in his crim&s;on-dama&s;k chair, dre&s;&s;ed in his long green gown, and white night-cap, li&s;tening to her with a &s;ort of elevation in his look, and &s;ometimes a&s;&s;enting to an affecting pa&s;|&s;age by the lifting up of his hands, and a movement of his lips in a &s;hort ejaculation. When &s;he had done reading, &s;he always &s;tayed to conver&s;e with him a little; and, when &s;he &s;aw him quite cheerful, &s;he bid him good night, and received a ki&s;s, and a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>This old man, who had kept the be&s;t
<PB N="63" REF="66">
company in his youth, had much of the old-fa&s;hioned politene&s;s. The forms of ancient ceremony mu&s;t have been burden|&s;ome in the intercour&s;e of &s;ociety; yet in an old per&s;on this kind of manner &s;till appears re&s;pectable. We are charmed with the light and graceful accompani|ments with which the ta&s;te of Brown has decorated our modern villas, and rejoice that each alley has no more "a bro|ther:" but when we vi&s;it an ancient man|&s;ion, who can wi&s;h that its long avenues of venerable trees, &s;anctified by age, and their connection with the days of former years, and the generations that are pa&s;t, &s;hould feel the de&s;troying axe, and give place to new improvements?</P>
<P>The old man had a ta&s;te for flowers, which he cultivated with great a&s;&s;iduity, and which he planted, with all the variety he could procure, round the borders of a little lawn before the hou&s;e. A green &s;lope led from the lawn to the river Thames: one &s;olitary willow-tree grew
<PB N="64" REF="67">
at the top of this bank. The old man had a &s;eat made for him&s;elf under the &s;hade of this tree. There he delighted to &s;it, and contemplate the green banks of the oppo&s;ite &s;hore&mdash;the reflected land&s;cape in the &s;tream&mdash;the gentle motion of the current&mdash;the &s;un-beams playing on the wa|ters&mdash;the long-necked &s;wans gliding ma|je&s;tically by, unle&s;s tempted towards the bank by the crumbs with which he fed them&mdash;the black-bird's &s;weet and vari|ous note, in &s;ome neighbouring trees, &s;ometimes interrupted by the thru&s;h or the linnet&mdash;the boats which were pa&s;&s;ing continually, and added chearfulne&s;s and animation to the picture.</P>
<P>The old man was vi&s;ited every Sa|turday morning by a &s;et of pen&s;ioners, to each of whom he gave a &s;mall weekly al|lowance. He had not much to give; yet he denied him&s;elf &s;ome indulgences his age required, to be&s;tow that little; which, however trifling, was &s;ufficient to procure &s;ome additional comfort to the
<PB N="65" REF="68">
receivers. The luxuries of the poor are not expen&s;ive, and the rich can make them happy by parting with &s;o little, that it can &s;carcely be termed a privation. This benevolent old man felt charity le&s;s a duty than a plea&s;ure. He might have made the &s;ame appeal to Heaven which was made by Job, "if I have eaten my mor&s;el my&s;elf alone, and the fatherle&s;s hath not eaten thereof," without dan|ger of incurring the forfeiture. He felt none of that admiration of him&s;elf which the &s;elfi&s;h feel when they perform a kind action; for he could perceive little merit in exertions which were attended with the mo&s;t &s;weet and exqui&s;ite &s;ati&s;|faction. That kindne&s;s which flows from the heart, is like a clear &s;tream, that pours its full and rapid current cheer|fully along, for ever unob&s;tructed in its cour&s;e; while tho&s;e acts of beneficence, which are performed with reluctance, re|&s;emble &s;hallow waters &s;upplied by a mud|dy fountain, retarded in their noi&s;y pro|gre&s;s
<PB N="66" REF="69">
by every pebble, dried by heat, and frozen by cold. This old man's chief &s;ource of happine&s;s was drawn from reli|gion. His devotion was more than ha|bitual; for his mind had attained that &s;tate in which reflection is but a kind of mental prayer; and every object around him was to him a &s;ubject of adoration, and a motive for gratitude.

<P>The contemplation of a venerable old man &s;inking thus gently into the arms of death, &s;upported by filial affection, and animated by religious hope, excites a &s;eri|ous yet not unplea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation. When the gay and bu&s;y &s;cenes of life are pa&s;t, and the years advance which "have no plea&s;ure in them," what is left for age to wi&s;h, but that its infirmities may be &s;oothed by the watchful &s;olicitude of ten|derne&s;s, and its darkne&s;s cheered by a

ray of that light "which cometh from above?" To &s;uch per&s;ons life, even in its la&s;t &s;tage, is &s;till agreeable. They do not droop like tho&s;e flowers, which, when their vigour is pa&s;t, lo&s;e at once their beauty and their fragrance; but have more affinity to the fading ro&s;e, which, when its enchanting colours are fled, &s;till retains its exhilarating &s;weetne&s;s, and is loved and cheri&s;hed even in decay.</P>

<P>VERSES were &s;ometimes compo&s;ed by Julia, merely to amu&s;e her grandfather; who u&s;ed to read them with a degree of &s;atisfaction, which may, per|haps, be pardoned from the con&s;ideration that the writer was his grand-daughter. Affection is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to blind the judgment; and if &s;o, &s;he probably throws one of her thicke&s;t bandages acro&s;s the critical ta&s;te of a grandfather, while he is peru&s;ing the productions of one, who is the darling of his age, the joy of his eyes, and the &s;oother of his infirmi|ties.</P>

<P>MR. Clifford returned from the Ea&s;t Indies, and had the &s;atisfaction of reaching England time enough to &s;ee his father again.&mdash;The old man had almo&s;t de&s;paired of this meeting. He threw his arms round his &s;on's neck, and embraced him for a con&s;iderable time in &s;ilence. When he was able to &s;peak, he &s;aid to him, in the words of Jacob, for the lan|guage of &s;cripture was familiar to him, "Now let me die, &s;ince I have &s;een thy face, becau&s;e thou art yet alive!"&mdash;This happy family experienced tho&s;e delightful &s;en&s;ations in each other's &s;ociety, which can only be felt after long ab&s;ence. Our affections are not con&s;tantly active, they are called forth by circum&s;tances; and what can awaken them &s;o forcibly, as the
<PB N="73" REF="76">
renewal of tho&s;e dome&s;tic endearments which con&s;titute the charm of our ex|i&s;tence?</P>
<P>Mr. Clifford returned with an ample fortune, and without one &s;ubject of &s;elf|reproach to embitter the enjoyment of it. He induced the per&s;on who was in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the old family e&s;tate to part with it, by giving him a price beyond its value. This event &s;eemed a renovation of life to the good old man; who expre&s;&s;ed &s;o earne&s;t a de&s;ire to end his days in that beloved &s;pot, that his &s;ons determined to remove him thither by &s;low and ea&s;y journies.</P>
<P>He was accompanied, like the patri|arch of old, by his children and grand|children. When they reached the &s;um|mit of a hill which gave him the fir&s;t view of his paternal man&s;ion, he ordered the po&s;tilions to &s;top; and gazed upon the &s;cene before him with a &s;ort of eleva|tion in his look, which &s;newed that his mind was in intercour&s;e with heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="77">
As he de&s;cended the hill, he &s;aw his tenants coming out to meet him.&mdash;The women brought their infants in their arms to receive his ble&s;&s;ing, and the old men crawled to the &s;ide of the chai&s;e as well as they could, and ble&s;&s;ed God that they had lived to &s;ee their old ma&s;ter again.&mdash;His heart was too full for &s;peech; but he pointed to his two lovely grand-daughters, who&s;e eyes were &s;uffu&s;ed in tears, and at length told the people, in a broken voice, that he had brought tho&s;e trea&s;ures to make them happy. Amid&s;t ble&s;&s;ings and acclamations, this welcome retinue reached the family-&s;eat. The tenants were fea&s;ted in the hall; the ale flowed liberally; no|thing was heard but the voice of rejoi|cing: and the Vicar of Wakefield, who had a ta&s;te for happy human faces, would have found this a charming &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>The old man&s;ion, which was &s;eated on the &s;ide of a hill, was embo&s;omed in trees; and the land&s;cape around it ex|hibited the mo&s;t picture&s;que variety. The
<PB N="75" REF="78">
hou&s;e commanded a view of the cele|brated lake of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">; its boundaries in &s;ome places frowning in a &s;eries of rude broken crags and rocky promontories, and in others ri&s;ing into verdant hills, richly wooded to the edge of the water. The &s;ound of a cataract, which precipi|tated it&s;elf into the lake, was heard, and its foam was &s;een at a di&s;tance. A hang|ing wood, planted on a part of the &s;ame hill where the hou&s;e &s;tood, threw the mo&s;t venerable &s;hade from its old maje&s;tic trees.&mdash;A wild irregular path led from the man&s;ion to a deep glen, which opened into a vale where the little village of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> is built. Its &s;mall white &s;pire ri&s;es above the &s;traw hamlets, and a clear winding rivulet wanders through this &s;weet tranquil vale; which is encompa&s;&s;ed by mountains, &s;ome of who&s;e tops are cover|ed with &s;now, and &s;ome darkened by the clouds that re&s;t upon them. The con|tra&s;t between this cultivated valley, and
<PB N="76" REF="79">
its &s;avage boundaries, was &s;o &s;triking, that it &s;eemed like Beauty repo&s;ing in the arms of Horror, and &s;heltered in its &s;afe retreat from the tempe&s;ts which &s;pent their force above.</P>
<P>The old furniture, which had been placed in Mr. Clifford's paternal man|&s;ion, by his ance&s;tors, &s;till remained; for, the gentleman who had purcha&s;ed the e&s;tate dying &s;oon after, his &s;on, a gay and di&s;&s;ipated young man, had never vi&s;ited the place but once, when he came to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it upon the death of his fa|ther, and had made no alterations.</P>
<P>The walls of the larger apartments were &s;till hung with rich tape&s;try, on &s;ome of which was repre&s;ented Calyp&s;o's enchant|ed i&s;land, where the blooming Telema|chus &s;tood ardently gazing on the nymphs, regardle&s;s of the frown of the venerable Mentor. Some of the hangings di&s;played the defeat of the Spani&s;h armada, and the taking of Cadiz, by the Earl of E&s;&s;ex.
<PB N="77" REF="80">
Many tales of other times were related on the ancient walls; but on &s;ome the colours were &s;o faded, and the action &s;o defaced, that all that could be per|ceived was a half-&s;een figure, or a face that dimly glared from the pale ground|work, or an arm that &s;eemed &s;tretched out in defiance.</P>
<P>The great &s;tair-ca&s;e, and the floors of the &s;tate apartments, which were of oak, and had been rubbed with careful diligence for the reception of the family, &s;hone bright as a mirror, and occa&s;ioned many a fal&s;e &s;tep to the London &s;ervants, who were unu&s;ed to &s;uch &s;lippery treading. The broad and immoveable chairs of the &s;tate-rooms, holding forth their gigantic arms, &s;eemed calculated for beings of a larger make than the pre&s;ent race of mor|tals; and the&s;e ma&s;&s;y chairs were covered with dama&s;k &s;o rich and durable, that it appeared to have been made for the u&s;e of the antediluvian ages.</P>
<P>A long gallery on the fir&s;t floor was
<PB N="78" REF="81">
hung with the portraits of the Clifford family, in antique dre&s;&s;es, with bu&s;hy beards, great &s;cymetars, &s;hort whi&s;kers, and &s;tiff ruffs; and placed in heavy gilt frames: a collection which, at a &s;ale of pictures, would perhaps have &s;old no bet|ter than aunt Deborah and her flock of &s;heep. But the venerable owner of the man&s;ion felt as great a re&s;pect for his an|ce&s;tors, as Sir Oliver him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifford had too much pride in his family to remove any marks of its an|cient magnificence. He left, therefore, the tape&s;try, the ma&s;&s;y chairs, and the family pictures, undi&s;turbed, as u&s;ele&s;s but proud monuments of antiquity, in the back-ground of his apartments, while he took care to bring forward all the com|forts and conveniences of modern lux|ury.</P>
<P>On the evening of their arrival at the family-&s;eat, Julia walked out with Char|lotte, and felt, with particular &s;en&s;ibility, the beauties of nature. She had, till now,
<PB N="79" REF="82">
only &s;een the rich cultivated land&s;capes of the &s;outh of England; but her ardent imagination had often wandered amid&s;t the wild &s;cenery of the north, and formed a high idea of plea&s;ure in contemplating its &s;olemn a&s;pect; and &s;he found that the &s;ublime and awful graces of nature ex|ceed even the dream of fancy. The &s;et|ting &s;un painted the glowing horizon with the mo&s;t refulgent colours: imme|diately above its broad orb, which was dazzling in brightne&s;s, hung a black cloud that formed a &s;triking contra&s;t to the luxuriant tints below: &s;ome of the hills were thrown into deep &s;hadow, others reflected the &s;etting beams. When the &s;un &s;unk below the horizon, every object gradually changed its hue. The form of the &s;urrounding hills, and the &s;hape of the darkening rocks that hung over the lake, became every moment more doubtful; till at length twilight &s;pread over the whole land&s;cape that pen|&s;ive gloom &s;o &s;oothing to an enthu&s;ia&s;tic
<PB N="80" REF="83">
fancy. Every other &s;ound was lo&s;t in the fall of the torrent, a &s;ound which Julia had never heard before, and which &s;eem|ed to &s;trike upon her &s;oul, and call forth emotions congenial to its &s;olemn ca|dence.</P>
<P>The moon now aro&s;e clear and lovely above the dark hills, with a circle of un|u&s;ual lu&s;tre round her orb: the beams &s;uddenly &s;pread their light over the whole lake, except where long deep lines of &s;hadow were thrown from the rocks on its &s;urface. Julia gazed upon the objects which &s;urrounded her with a tran&s;port of mind which &s;he had never felt before. She uttered frequent exclamations of ad|miration and wonder; but &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;ations with which her &s;oul was overwhelmed. It is in &s;uch moments as the&s;e that the &s;oul becomes con&s;cious of her native dignity: we &s;eem to be brought nearer to the Deity; we feel the &s;en&s;e of his &s;acred pre|&s;ence; the low-minded cares of earth va|ni&s;h;
<PB N="81" REF="84">
we view all nature beaming with benignity, and with beauty; and we re|po&s;e with divine confidence on him, who has thus embelli&s;hed his creation. In the country, the mind borrows virtue from the &s;cene. When we tread the lofty moun|tain, when the ample lake &s;preads its broad expan&s;e of waters to our view, when we li&s;ten to the fall of the torrent, the awed and a&s;toni&s;hed mind is rai&s;ed above the temptations of guilt; and when we wander amid the &s;ofter &s;cenes of nature, the charms of the land&s;cape, the &s;ong of the birds, the mildne&s;s of the breeze, and the murmurs of the &s;tream, &s;ooth the pa&s;&s;ions into peace, excite the mo&s;t gentle emotions, and have power to cure "all &s;adne&s;s but de&s;pair." "Can man forbear to &s;mile with nature? Can the &s;tormy pa&s;&s;ions in his bo&s;om roll, while every gale is peace, and every grove is melody?"</P>
<P>A whole &s;ummer pa&s;&s;ed delightfully to the happy inhabitants of Mr. Clifford's
<PB N="82" REF="85">
ho&s;pitable man&s;ion. He employed him|&s;elf in arranging his affairs, redre&s;&s;ing the grievances of which his tenants com|plained, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting &s;uch as wanted his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>His brother con&s;ented to live with him; and Mr. Clifford, without his knowledge, &s;ettled five hundred pounds a year upon him for life, by a deed &s;o framed, that it was not in his own power to revoke it. He al&s;o bound him&s;elf to give Julia ten thou&s;and pounds at the death of her father. When the deed was executed according to all the forms of law, Mr. Clifford pre&s;ented it to his bro|ther in a manner too delicate to wound his pride, and too tender not to gratify his affection.</P>
<P>The happine&s;s of this dome&s;tic circle was interrupted by the bad health of Mr. Clifford. His con&s;titution had &s;uffered materially from a hot climate, and his increa&s;ing complaints obliged him to go to Bath; which, however, failed to pro|duce
<PB N="83" REF="86">
any &s;alutary effects. His phy&s;icians thought him unable to bear the &s;everity of the approaching winter in this coun|try, and he was ordered to Nice. With this advice he reluctantly complied; and, before he &s;et out for the continent, took a journey to the north, to embrace his fa|ther once more; whom he left to the care of his brother and Julia, and took Char|lotte with him abroad.</P>
<P>The old man, who did not long &s;ur|vive the departure of his &s;on, in his dy|ing hour expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at the thoughts of being buried in the tomb of his fathers: &s;o true it is, that, "even from the tomb the voice of nature cries, even in our a&s;hes live their wonted fires!" He expired calmly, and without a groan; nor could tho&s;e who witne&s;&s;ed the pious re&s;ignation of his la&s;t moments, avoid wi&s;hing "to die the death of the righ|teous, and that their latter end might be like his!"</P>
<P>His corp&s;e was attended to the place of
<PB N="84" REF="87">
interment by a long proce&s;&s;ion of his te|nants, who hung over his grave as if un|willing to leave it; while the old re|counted to the young, all they remember|ed of his childhood and his youth.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifford received at Nice the in|telligence of his father's death, and felt the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible regret at not having been pre&s;ent to perform the la&s;t duties to his venerable parent. He wrote to his brother, reque&s;ting that he and Julia would prepare for a journey to Nice early in the &s;pring; as he him&s;elf intended to vi&s;it Italy, and wi&s;hed for the gratification of their &s;ociety on his tour.</P>
<P>Mean while Mr. Clifford, after two months re&s;idence at Nice, found his health &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, that he went from that place to pa&s;s &s;ome time at Avignon. He there met with Mr. Frederick Sey|mour, the &s;econd brother of Mr. Sey|mour, who had been &s;ent abroad as &s;ecre|tary to the emba&s;&s;y at <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, where he had remained &s;ome years. When the am|ba&s;&s;ador
<PB N="85" REF="88">
was recalled, Mr. Frederick Seymour was invited to make the tour of France and Italy with a friend, and was on his way to Rome when he became acquainted with Mr. Clifford and Char|lotte, neither of whom he had before &s;een; for Mr. Seymour's acquaintance and marriage with Mi&s;s Melbourne had taken place &s;ome time after Mr. Frede|rick Seymour's departure.</P>
<P>This young man was of a different character from either of his brothers, and &s;uperior to both. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ele|vated under&s;tanding, and the fine ta&s;te, for which his elder brother was con&s;pi|cuous; and he had al&s;o that love of di&s;|tinction which belongs to a man of parts and &s;pirit; but his ambition was of that nobler kind, which pur&s;ues its ends fairly, openly, and honourably. Equally inca|pable of the deep-laid plots of one bro|ther, and the little artifices of the other, Mr. Frederick Seymour di&s;dained to tread in the &s;erpentine paths of duplicity
<PB N="86" REF="89">
and cunning; and his character was &s;trongly marked by an impatience of every thing mean, &s;elfi&s;h, or &s;ordid.&mdash;His early intercour&s;e with the world had not chilled that enthu&s;ia&s;m which is awake to every generous impre&s;&s;ion, and that warmth of feeling which long continues to animate an ardent mind, and which, in &s;ome, the di&s;appointment of their deare&s;t hopes, the experience of the coldne&s;s and &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s of mankind, and even the chilling hand of age it&s;elf, have no power to re|pre&s;s. The noble principles which actu|ated Seymour's mind, gave it additional force and vigour. It will ever be found that great talents derive new energy from the virtue of the character; as when the &s;un-beam plays upon gems, it calls forth all their &s;cattered radiance. Mr. Frederick Seymour's per&s;on was tall and elegant; his eyes were dark, and his countenance was &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of intelligence and &s;en&s;ibility. His conver&s;ation was highly agreeable, and his manners were infi|nitely
<PB N="87" REF="90">
engaging; and his good under|&s;tanding had taught him to connect the poli&s;h of fa&s;hion, with plainne&s;s and &s;im|plicity. He had acquired ea&s;e without negligence, and frankne&s;s without fami|liarity. Perfect good-breeding undoubt|edly requires the foundation of good &s;en&s;e; as the oak, which is the mo&s;t &s;olid and valuable, is al&s;o the mo&s;t graceful tree of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>Charlotte was con&s;tantly in Mr. Sey|mour's &s;ociety, and &s;he &s;oon felt its pow|ers of fa&s;cination. In the mornings they rode out in little parties, amid&s;t &s;cenes the mo&s;t lovely and romantic. They often vi&s;ited the fountain of Vauclu&s;e, and Mr. Seymour &s;till appeared to find in&s;piration in its waters. He compo&s;ed &s;onnets, which Charlotte read with plea|&s;ure; he pointed out the beauties of the &s;cenes they vi&s;ited, or traced them with his pencil; and Charlotte gazed on them with delight. He perceived her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour, and was &s;olicitous to improve
<PB N="88" REF="91">
her partiality. The &s;weetne&s;s and viva|city of her di&s;po&s;ition, the &s;implicity of her manners, and the purity of her heart, formed a contra&s;t to the vanity and le|vity of many young women in the gay circle of Avignon, very favourable to Charlotte.</P>

<P>CAPTAIN Clifford and his daughter pa&s;&s;ed the months, previous to their intended journey, in a retirement which was cheared by books, by mu&s;ic, and, above all, by the plea&s;ures of benevo|lence. Julia rejoiced in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of fortune, becau&s;e &s;he could now indulge the feelings of compa&s;&s;ion. She was no longer &s;ubject to the pain of flying from di&s;tre&s;s, which &s;he was unable to relieve: &s;he remembered how often her eyes, wet with tears, had been lifted up to heaven, and implored that &s;he might one day have the power of comforting the afflict|ed! Her prayer had been accepted, the days of affluence were arrived, and they were devoted to the purpo&s;es of benevo|lence.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="93">
Julia &s;pread a little circle of happine&s;s around her. She had too that &s;oothing charm in her manner, which proceeds from the mo&s;t delicate attention to the feelings of others: &s;he be&s;towed her alms with that gentlene&s;s and &s;ympathy, by which the value of her donations was in|crea&s;ed, and her pity was almo&s;t as dear to the poor as her charity.</P>
<P>Meantime, Mr. Clifford, though not very quick in penetration, at length di&s;|cerned his daughter's partiality for Mr. Frederick Seymour, who&s;e talents he ad|mired, and who&s;e character he e&s;teemed.

<P>I write to you with a degree of angui&s;h, which renders me almo&s;t incapable of holding my pen. La&s;t week I was all joy and exultation, at the thoughts of our journey to Avignon&mdash;Alas, tho&s;e dreams of hap|pine&s;s have vani&s;hed for ever!

Mr. Clifford did not he&s;itate a mo|ment in obeying the mandate contain|ed in this melancholy letter: he and Charlotte left Avignon that night, in their way to England&mdash;Mr. Frederick Seymour wi&s;hed to accompany them, but this they would not allow. He, how|ever, obtained their con&s;ent to follow them in a &s;hort time to England; and Charlotte promi&s;ed to write to him, on her arrival at home, and inform him of the &s;ituation of her uncle.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifford had the melancholy con|&s;olation of reaching home time enough to &s;ee his beloved brother once more. He found Captain Clifford in a &s;tate of great compo&s;ure of mind. He talked with re&s;ignation of his approaching di&s;&s;olution, and exerted all the little &s;trength he had left in comforting his friends: he told them he felt the mo&s;t firm per&s;ua&s;ion that they &s;hould meet again in a better region, never more to feel the pang of &s;eparation. He then made Julia unloo&s;e a ribbon from his neck, to which was
<PB N="94" REF="97">
fixed a locket that hung upon his brea&s;t, and which contained &s;ome of his wife's hair&mdash;He de&s;ired Julia to cut off a little of his own hair, and put it into the lock|et. He begged that his brother would keep his watch, and Charlotte a ring for his &s;ake. They will &s;erve, added he, as Ophelia &s;ays, "for thoughts, and remem|brances." He then gra&s;ped Julia's hand while &s;he knelt at his bed&s;ide, and &s;aid to her, in a faint voice, "Compo&s;e your mind, my love! you will &s;till have a fa|ther in my brother's protection&mdash;I leave you to his care&mdash;God Almighty ble&s;s you, my child&mdash;and reward your filial good|ne&s;s! You have been the comfort of my life&mdash;and death has no pang but leaving you!&mdash;but we &s;hall meet"&mdash;His voice became inarticulate, and in a few minutes he expired. Julia was with difficulty per|&s;uaded to for&s;ake the breathle&s;s remains of her father: &s;he clung to his corp&s;e in an agony of unutterable &s;orrow; and in vain Charlotte endeavoured to &s;ooth
<PB N="95" REF="98">
her affliction; in vain Mr. Clifford at|tempted to con&s;ole her by the a&s;&s;urance, that it &s;hould be the con&s;tant aim of his life to promote her happine&s;s. In the bitterne&s;s of her &s;oul, Julia &s;hrunk from the&s;e a&s;&s;urances: the la&s;t &s;igh of her fa|ther &s;eemed to her the extinction of eve|ry earthly hope, and her aching heart re|fu&s;ed that happine&s;s which he could no longer participate.&mdash;Her father had al|ways treated her as a friend, and her af|fection for him was unbounded. When &s;he looked back on the pa&s;t, &s;he recol|lected, on his part, a con&s;tant wi&s;h to make her happy; and an uniform gentle|ne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, which rendered that wi&s;h effectual. She could recall no ex|pre&s;&s;ion of har&s;hne&s;s, none of tho&s;e fits of moro&s;ene&s;s, or caprice, notwith&s;tand|ing which, obedience to a parent &s;till re|mains a duty, but &s;ometimes cea&s;es to be a plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In the reflection on her own conduct towards her father, Julia felt the &s;ooth|ing
<PB N="96" REF="99">
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done more than even duty required. She had not only implicitly obeyed every injunction, and complied with every wi&s;h of her father; but &s;he had lived in the con|&s;tant habit of making every &s;acrifice to his comfort, that the quick &s;en&s;ibility of her own heart could &s;ugge&s;t&mdash;&s;acrifices of ea&s;e, of convenience, of plea&s;ure, which aro&s;e from the confined circum&s;tances of her father; &s;acrifices, which &s;he carefully concealed from his knowledge, and of which &s;he found the &s;ole reward in her own bo&s;om.</P>
<P>When, at length, the all-&s;ubduing in|fluence of time had compo&s;ed her mind &s;ufficiently to enjoy the beauties of na|ture, the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, and the comforts of affluence, &s;he &s;till frequently lamented, with tears of bitter regret, that her father had not lived to partake longer of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings. She reflected, that his life had been the con&s;tant &s;truggle of an high and honourable &s;pirit with mi&s;|fortune,
<PB N="97" REF="100">
poverty, and neglect: &s;he wept at the recollection of tho&s;e difficulties in which &s;he had often &s;een him involved, of tho&s;e anxieties he had &s;uffered for her &s;ake; and mourned that the hour of pro&s;|perity had &s;carcely arrived, before the ob|ject of her pious affection was moulder|ing in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>The tranquillity &s;he regained, was not like the &s;weet glow of a &s;ummer morning, enlivened by &s;un&s;hine, and the exulting &s;ong of the birds: it had more affinity to the pen&s;ive &s;tillne&s;s of the evening, when the mildne&s;s of the air, and the fading charms of the land&s;cape, excite in the mind a &s;oft and tender &s;en&s;ation, which has a nearer alliance to melancholy than to joy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>A FEW months after the death of Captain Clifford, his brother in|vited Mrs. Melbourne, and Mr. and Mrs. Seymour, to &s;pend &s;ome time at his coun|try &s;eat, where Mr. Frederick Seymour was &s;oon expected.</P>
<P>Mrs. Melbourne brought with her a young man who was her relation, and for whom &s;he hoped, through Mr. Clifford's intere&s;t, to obtain an appointment in the Ea&s;t Indies. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but a very moderate &s;hare of benevolence, either in thought, word, or deed, towards the hu|man race in general; but &s;he eagerly em|braced this opportunity of providing for her own relation, and placing him above the want of farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance from her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lately &s;he had increa&s;ed her income
<PB N="99" REF="102">
by a prize of ten thou&s;and pounds in the lottery; but &s;he found the calculation of her own wants increa&s;e in the &s;ame pro|portion with her fortune; and in e&s;timat|ing the wants of others, &s;he was le&s;s exact in her arithmetic. This lady could hear the complaints of mi&s;ery with indifference, and &s;ee the tears of the unfortunate with|out &s;tretching out a hand to their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; and yet &s;he contrived to live at peace with her&s;elf. Soon after her mar|riage, &s;he had provided for a cou&s;in, who, by the death of both his parents, was thrown entirely upon her protection; and, whenever her heart reproached her with any deficiency of compa&s;&s;ion, &s;he in&s;tant|ly called to mind her cou&s;in, and per|&s;uaded her&s;elf that &s;ociety had no farther demands on her benevolence.</P>
<P>The young man whom &s;he now brought to Mr. Clifford's hou&s;e, had lo&s;t his fa|ther, and his mother was unable to pro|vide for him; but, happily for Mr. Char|tres, he was &s;o nearly related to Mrs.
<PB N="100" REF="103">
Melbourne, that her pride came in as an auxiliary to her benevolence in the deter|mination to promote his fortunes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Melbourne's occa&s;ional acts of beneficence, which generally proceeded either from o&s;tentation or fear, re&s;embled tho&s;e &s;canty &s;pots of verdure to which a &s;udden &s;hower will &s;ometimes give birth in a flinty and &s;terile &s;oil; while pure genuine philanthropy flows like tho&s;e un|&s;een dews which are only marked in their benign effects, &s;preading new charms over creation.</P>
<P>Mr. Chartres had been educated by the curate of a &s;mall village in York|&s;hire, who had taught him Greek, Latin, and mathematics, but had not given him the lea&s;t knowledge of men and man|ners, that being a &s;cience of which his preceptor was entirely ignorant. At nineteen Mr. Chartres returned to his mother, who had a &s;mall hou&s;e in Lon|don. She was a weak vain woman, and, being exceedingly di&s;gu&s;ted with her &s;on's
<PB N="101" REF="104">
awkwardne&s;s, and quite incapable of judg|ing of his cla&s;&s;ical acqui&s;itions, very thank|fully re&s;igned him to Mrs. Melbourne, who introduced him in all his native &s;im|plicity to Mr. Clifford.</P>
<P>Mr. Chartres was tall and thin, and &s;o perfectly erect, that he had not the &s;malle&s;t tendency towards a bend in his whole figure. His coat was always buttoned quite clo&s;e, and di&s;played his &s;hape with great exactne&s;s; his complexion was &s;al|low, his a&s;pect &s;olemn, and his black hair hung lank down his &s;houlders. He had a good under&s;tanding, and a warm vene|ration for literature; but his extreme awkwardne&s;s could only be equalled by his &s;implicity. In the company of &s;trangers he was entirely &s;ilent. When longer ac|quaintance gave him courage to &s;peak, his opinions were found to be re&s;pectable, on account of their antiquity: his &s;enti|ments were &s;trictly moral; and, though there was no novelty in his ideas, they were generally delivered in a manner pe|culiar
<PB N="102" REF="105">
to him&s;elf. Chartres had a tender heart, felt the influence of beauty, and wi&s;hed to &s;how the mo&s;t devoted at|tention to the ladies: but whenever he attempted any mark of gallantry, it gene|rally ended in his own di&s;grace, though he never hazarded any &s;uch attempt with|out mature deliberation; for he was always obliged, previou&s;ly to the &s;lighte&s;t move|ment he made in company, to call forth all his rea&s;oning faculties, and convince him&s;elf that it was unmanly, as well as unphilo&s;ophical, to tremble at walking acro&s;s the room, placing a chair for a lady, or handing her a tea-cup. Yet even after he had &s;ettled his plans of courte&s;y in his own mind, much to his &s;atisfaction, he was apt to mar them by his mode of performance. But we will leave him to &s;truggle with his ba&s;hful terrors, and re|turn to Julia.</P>
<P>One evening, when the party a&s;&s;embled at Mr. Clifford's preferred cards to walk|ing, &s;he went out alone, and wandered
<PB N="103" REF="106">
along the border of the lake; gazing at the maje&s;tic &s;cenery around her, which was ob&s;cured by twilight, while imagina|tion gave new forms to every half-&s;een object. On her way home &s;he &s;topped at a cottage near the hou&s;e, and, &s;eating her&s;elf on a &s;traw chair at the door, pa|tiently li&s;tened to the good woman's anec|dotes of her poultry.</P>
<P>Julia u&s;ually &s;pent two hours every day in teaching the children of the cottagers to read. She had a particular fondne&s;s for children, which is an affection very natural to a tender heart; for what is more intere&s;ting than the innocence, the helple&s;&s;ne&s;s, the endearing &s;implicity of childhood?&mdash;The elde&s;t child of the good woman who loved to talk of her poultry, was a girl of &s;even years of age, with a ruddy complexion, and auburn ringlets, and was Julia's di&s;tingui&s;hed fa|vourite. Little Peggy did not, however, owe this di&s;tinction to any advantages of beauty over her companions; for ro&s;y
<PB N="104" REF="107">
cheeks, and curled locks, were in great plenty in the village. Julia's partiality aro&s;e from an incident we &s;hall mention.</P>
<P>One morning, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the cot|tage, &s;he looked in at the window, and &s;aw little Peggy &s;tanding at the table, taking &s;ome flies out of a bowl of water, and placing them in the &s;un, where they &s;hook their wet wings, and were a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the operation of drying them&s;elves by Peggy; who put her face very clo&s;e to the table, and endeavoured to revive them with her warm breath. When Ju|lia entered the cottage, the child, who knew her well, looked up in her face, and told her to "come and &s;ee how glad the flies were to get out." Peggy was en|deared to Julia by her kindne&s;s to the flies; for &s;he her&s;elf felt for every thing that had life, with a degree of &s;en&s;ibility which many would account a fooli&s;h weakne&s;s. She had frequently been en|gaged in the very &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s of re&s;cu|ing flies from de&s;truction; and, when &s;he
<PB N="105" REF="108">
&s;aw a worm lying in her path, had often conveyed it to a place of &s;afety among the untrodden gra&s;s, to prevent its being cru&s;hed by &s;ome foot le&s;s careful than her own. We do not pretend to ju&s;tify the&s;e actions, which people, who have firm nerves for every pain that does not reach them&s;elves, may probably ridicule; but we think it our duty to relate the fact.</P>
<P>Julia had indeed no le&s;&s;on of humanity left untaught by her grandfather. She had &s;een the linnets and &s;parrows, who built their ne&s;ts in the neighbourhood of that good old man, &s;ecure of a comfort|able provi&s;ion in winter; and the robins, who ventured to his gate, had always met with an ho&s;pitable reception. He had often, when recommending tender|ne&s;s to animals, pointed out to his grand-daughter that pa&s;&s;age in &s;cripture&mdash;<Q REND="inline">Are not five &s;parrows &s;old for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten be|fore God!</Q>&mdash;Dear, and venera|ble old man! how congenial to thy &s;pirit
<PB N="106" REF="109">
was this tender a&s;&s;urance!&mdash;by what heart is univer&s;al benevolence cheri&s;hed as it was by thine!&mdash;But this beloved old man has led us from the cottage, and little Peggy; who now repeated a hymn Julia had taught her, with her hands joined to|gether, and her voice &s;corning all pau&s;e as long as her breath would hold out. Julia promi&s;ed her a reward if &s;he would mind her &s;tops; and &s;he went to play with her brother, a child of three years of age, before the door of the cottage. A few minutes after, Julia &s;aw her &s;trug|gling to bring her brother to the door, but the little one refu&s;ed to come; upon which Peggy fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">w to the door, pointed to her brother, and bur&s;t into tears. Julia ro&s;e ha&s;tily from her &s;eat, and, &s;tepping forward, &s;aw a gentleman and his &s;er|vant riding at full &s;peed towards them; and &s;o near the child, that &s;he had only time to fly, at the hazard of her own life, and &s;natch him away. The &s;creams of his mother, and the appearance of Julia,
<PB N="107" REF="110">
fir&s;t informed the &s;tranger of the child's danger, which the approach of night, and the additional gloom ca&s;t by &s;ome trees over the road, had prevented him from &s;eeing. He in&s;tantly di&s;mounted, and, giving the reins to his &s;ervant, ha&s;t|ened to Julia, expre&s;&s;ed his concern for the alarm he had occa&s;ioned her, and enquired with great earne&s;tne&s;s if &s;he had recovered her terror.&mdash;After a few mi|nutes conver&s;ation, he told her that he was on his way to Mr. Clifford's hou&s;e&mdash;"That hou&s;e is my home," &s;aid Julia. She then di&s;covered that &s;he was conver&s;ing with Mr. Frederick Seymour, who a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to attend her home. To this &s;he readily con&s;ented; but before they &s;et out &s;he wiped away the tears, which &s;till &s;tood in the eye of her ro&s;y-cheeked pupil, and told her &s;he would always love her for taking care of little Tom.</P>
<P>Mr. Frederick Seymour followed Julia into the drawing-room without being announced. Charlotte was thrown into
<PB N="108" REF="111">
&s;ome confu&s;ion by his &s;udden appearance, but &s;oon recovered her&s;elf: the adventure at the cottage was recounted, and the evening pa&s;&s;ed away cheerfully. Even Mrs. Melbourne, who&s;e manners were u&s;ually formal and ungracious, caught the univer&s;al gladne&s;s. She tried to be agreeable, and &s;ucceeded as well as could be expected from one not much accu&s;tomed to make the experiment. In general Mrs. Melbourne &s;poke but little, and never hazarded any &s;entiment that aro&s;e in her heart, till &s;he had fir&s;t made it travel to her head, and examined whe|ther it was preci&s;ely &s;uch as would do her honour; and &s;he delivered her opi|nions, even among her friends, with the mo&s;t laboured correctne&s;s. Her under|&s;tanding was always in full dre&s;s; not like that of the pre&s;ent times, ea&s;y, gay, and graceful; but more re&s;embling the &s;tiff ruffs, and &s;tately finery of the days of Queen Elizabeth.</P>
<P>Mr. Seymour alone had &s;ome unplea|&s;ant
<PB N="109" REF="112">
reflections. He &s;aw that his brother, without the practice of duplicity, had obtained a fortune far &s;uperior, and a woman in every view more amiable, than all his own deep-laid &s;chemes had ac|quired for him&s;elf. While he made the&s;e reflections, his heart &s;ickened at the re|collection of all the plots and counter|plots of his head; and he lamented, that the labour of years had en&s;ured to him a le&s;s degree of pro&s;perity than &s;eemed, un&s;olicited, to court the acceptance of his brother.</P>
<P>Mr. Charles Seymour felt nothing but joy at his brother's marriage, which he knew would give the whole family addi|tional con&s;equence, and con&s;iderably in|crea&s;e its influence. He determined, however, not to be outdone by his bro|ther, but to take the fir&s;t opportunity of marrying the daughter of a nabob, him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>From the moment of his arrival at
<PB N="110" REF="113">
Mr. Clifford's &s;eat, he had endeavoured to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the favour of Julia, by paying her the mo&s;t con&s;tant di&s;tinctions. He fore&s;aw, that, as mi&s;tre&s;s of her uncle's hou&s;e, which would hap|pen on Charlotte's marriage, her impor|tance in the fa&s;hionable world would be con&s;iderable; and, though her fortune was not &s;ufficient to tempt him to any matrimonial de&s;igns upon her him&s;elf, he was &s;en&s;ible that, with her beauty and accompli&s;hments, &s;he could &s;carcely fail to marry advantageou&s;ly; &s;ince he knew that, though love was much out of fa&s;hion, there &s;till exi&s;ted &s;ome young men of rank and fortune, who were ad|dicted to that weakne&s;s; and &s;ome per|&s;on, of &s;uch a temper, might probably abate a few thou&s;ands in his matrimo|nial expectations, in con&s;ideration of Ju|lia's beauty. He therefore devoted his chief attention to that young lady; for Charlotte he con&s;idered as an acqui&s;i|tion
<PB N="111" REF="114">
already made to his family. Mr. Charles Seymour's principles of action were as mechanical as tho&s;e of a watch, con&s;tantly regulated by the bright noon|day &s;un; but all machines are &s;ubject to imperfection, and Charles's movements of courte&s;y towards Julia, which had formerly gone too &s;low, now went &s;omewhat too fa&s;t. She could not avoid being put in mind of his pa&s;t rude neglect, which &s;he would otherwi&s;e have forgotten, by his pre&s;ent ob&s;equious attention. When he flew to meet her at her entrance into the room, when he handed her with alacrity to the carriage, or rode by her &s;ide on hor&s;e|back, &s;he recollected how often he had formerly &s;een her enter, and depart, with|out taking the &s;malle&s;t notice of either.</P>
<P>A week after the arrival of Mr. Fre|derick Seymour, Mrs. Melbourne, and Mr. and Mrs. Seymour, left Mr. Clifford's hou&s;e on their way to Scotland, and Mr. Charles Seymour departed for the &s;eat of Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. Mr. Chartres was left at
<PB N="112" REF="115">
Mr. Clifford's till the return of the party, a circum&s;tance which gave him a degree of plea&s;ure that no one &s;u&s;pected; for he had not yet conquered the terrors his new acquaintances in&s;pired; and, though he admired and loved them, he had hi|therto kept both his admiration and his love a profound &s;ecret, and had never hazarded more than a mono&s;yllable at a time to any of the family. His good &s;en&s;e was wrapt up as carefully as a motto within a &s;ugar-image; and the cru&s;t of awkwardne&s;s was not ea&s;ily broken.</P>
<P>The &s;atisfaction derived from Mr. Fre|derick Seymour's arrival was not confined to Charlotte: his &s;ociety was felt to be a mo&s;t agreeable acqui&s;ition by the whole family. In his conver&s;ation there was originality, wit, and fancy; the &s;trength of a &s;uperior under&s;tanding, and the warmth of a feeling heart. The conver|&s;ation often turned on &s;ubjects of litera|ture, and Charlotte, though much le&s;s devoted to books than her cou&s;in, had a
<PB N="113" REF="116">
mind &s;ufficiently cultivated to bear a part in &s;uch conver&s;ations; which &s;he enjoyed the more on account of their giving her lover an opportunity of di&s;playing his ta|lents. Julia, who&s;e under&s;tanding was far &s;uperior to Charlotte's, &s;oon perceived that the powers of Seymour's mind were not fully di&s;cerned by her cou&s;in; that often a &s;troke of wit, an emanation of fancy, which &s;he her&s;elf admired, was not com|prehended by Charlotte; and that a mind le&s;s &s;uperior to the general ma&s;s of man|kind would have made her happy. Yet &s;he entertained not the lea&s;t doubt of her felicity in her marriage with Seymour. She knew that Charlotte was tenderly attached to him, and that he was fully &s;en&s;ible of all her claims to his affection; that he was charmed with the &s;weetne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition; and &s;he believed that he would do her merit the ju&s;tice it de|&s;erved.</P>
<P>Mr. Frederick Seymour and Julia were &s;oon the be&s;t friends po&s;&s;ible. She already
<PB N="114" REF="117">
con&s;idered him as the hu&s;band of Char|lotte, and he &s;ometimes, in a &s;ort of whi&s;|per, called her his cou&s;in. A month pa&s;&s;ed &s;o agreeably, that its flight was &s;carcely perceived by this dome&s;tic circle. In the enjoyment of the beauties of nature, the charms of friend&s;hip, and the delightful intercour&s;e of elegant and cultivated minds, the &s;tream of time flowed not like the turbulent torrent which ru&s;hes in un|equal cadence, as impelled by the tem|pe&s;tuous winds, nor like the &s;luggi&s;h pool, who&s;e waters re&s;t in dull &s;tagnation: it glided cheerfully along, like the clear rivulet of the valley, who&s;e &s;urface is un|ruffled by the bla&s;t of the mountains, and who&s;e bo&s;om reflects the verdant land&s;cape through which it pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Mr. Chartres, encouraged by the gen|tlene&s;s with which he was treated, con|quered his ba&s;hful terrors &s;ufficiently to enjoy the amiable &s;ociety in which he was placed. He no longer &s;at at table with as much apparent unea&s;ine&s;s as if he had
<PB N="115" REF="118">
been &s;tretched on the bed of Procru&s;tus. He rai&s;ed his eyes when he was &s;poken to, found it le&s;s difficult to di&s;po&s;e of his hands than formerly, lo&s;t his tremulous ac|cent, and &s;ometimes delivered his opi|nions with the firm tone of a man at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifford had &s;ome affairs to regu|late previou&s;ly to his daughter's marriage, which was therefore deferred two months longer: mean while Charlotte, who de|lighted to di&s;play the merits of Julia, and wi&s;hed her beloved friend to be a favourite with her future hu&s;band, was at pains, in her frequent conver&s;ations with Seymour, to give him the mo&s;t amiable picture of Julia; de&s;cribed her filial tenderne&s;s, her candour, her benevolence, and every ami|able quality &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of affection. This was unne|ce&s;&s;ary&mdash;Frederick Seymour had, at fir&s;t &s;ight, greatly admired Julia's beauty; and, as &s;he had conver&s;ed with him with the utmo&s;t frankne&s;s and cordiality, he found that the purity of her mind, and the good|ne&s;s
<PB N="116" REF="119">
of her heart, were equal to the excel|lence of her under&s;tanding; nor could he refu&s;e his friend&s;hip to one &s;o dear to Charlotte. He loved to talk to Charlotte of her cou&s;in; he loved to think of her when alone; and at length he di&s;covered that Charlotte's &s;ociety lo&s;t its charm when Julia was ab&s;ent. He could de|ceive him&s;elf no longer: Julia had in|&s;pired him with the mo&s;t violent, the mo&s;t unconquerable pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The gradations from friend&s;hip to love are often imperceptible to the mind. Like &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;hades of the &s;ame colour, they blend &s;o finely together, that it is difficult to mark the preci&s;e point at which their di&s;tinctions commence. Love comes to the bo&s;om under the gentle forms of e&s;teem, of &s;ympathy, of confidence: we li&s;ten with dangerous plea&s;ure to the &s;educing accents of his voice, till he lifts the fatal veil which concealed him from our view, and reigns a tyrant in the &s;oul. Rea&s;on is then an oracle no longer con&s;ulted; and
<PB N="117" REF="120">
happine&s;s, often life it&s;elf, become his vic|tims.</P>
<P>Seymour, called upon by every tie of honour to fulfil his engagements with Charlotte, re&s;olved to &s;tifle his unhappy pa&s;&s;ion for Julia, to treat her with re&s;erve, and to avoid her as much as po&s;&s;ible. That young lady had already perceived the &s;ituation of his mind. A thou&s;and little circum&s;tances in his behaviour had betrayed to her penetration the emotions of his heart&mdash;but indeed every woman is quick-&s;ighted on this &s;ubject. The per|turbation of an impa&s;&s;ioned mind cannot long be concealed from the object of its inquietude. In vain it may a&s;&s;ume the look of indifference, or wear the &s;mile of tranquillity: the mo&s;t trifling occurrences will &s;erve to di&s;cover the agitation of its feelings&mdash;as the light breeze, that but gently waves the branches of the other trees of the fore&s;t, makes every leaf of the poplar tremble.</P>
<P>The knowledge of Seymour's pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="118" REF="121">
gave Julia the mo&s;t cruel unea&s;ine&s;s. Her heart was too pure to think without horror of &s;upplanting Charlotte in the affections of her lover&mdash;that amiable Char|lotte, who&s;e &s;weetne&s;s and genero&s;ity of temper had led her to lavi&s;h upon Julia every di&s;tinction, every preference &s;he could be&s;tow; who, in every amu&s;ement, con&s;ulted Julia's ta&s;te, and forgot her own inclinations in &s;tudying to prevent Julia's wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, in the fulne&s;s of her heart, &s;he was on the point of flying to her cou&s;in, of revealing her &s;u&s;picions, and a&s;king Charlotte's permi&s;&s;ion to leave the hou&s;e till her marriage was accompli&s;hed; but a little reflection convinced her of the im|propriety of this mea&s;ure. She knew that Charlotte's affections were deeply en|gaged, and was &s;en&s;ible that to awaken a &s;u&s;picion of Seymour's indifference in her mind, would de&s;troy her peace for ever. She was convinced that he meant to fulfil his engagements, and &s;he had too
<PB N="119" REF="122">
much confidence in his honour and integ|rity, to doubt that he would treat Char|lotte, when his wife, with tenderne&s;s and attention. She hoped that Charlotte's &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, and the &s;eparation which would then take place between Seymour and her&s;elf, would entirely con|quer his unhappy prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in her fa|vour; and &s;he determined, mean while, to lock the fatal &s;ecret within her own brea&s;t, and to ha&s;ten the marriage by every means in her power.</P>

<P>FREDERICK Seymour and Julia now avoided each other by a &s;ort of tacit agreement. They never met but at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons when the whole family were a&s;|&s;embled; they were careful to place them|&s;elves at a di&s;tance from each other at table; and in the walks, which they fre|quently took along the wild and rugged boundaries of the lake, where they &s;ome|times wandered near the edge of the cliffs, or de&s;cended the hills by &s;teep and formidable paths, Mr. Seymour, even when Charlotte was e&s;corted by any other gentleman, never offered his arm to Julia, if there was any other lady pre|&s;ent. Julia was no le&s;s re&s;erved to wards him; but, if &s;he happened to walk behind him, &s;he always ob&s;erved
<PB N="121" REF="124">
that when the path was dangerous, he could not re&s;i&s;t looking back repeatedly, to &s;ee if &s;he was &s;afe. He appeared to be &s;olicitous to conver&s;e with any of Char|lotte's female vi&s;itors in preference to Ju|lia: yet, notwith&s;tanding this behaviour, it was ea&s;y for that young lady to per|ceive that he was acting a part which he performed with great difficulty; but &s;he was happy, at lea&s;t &s;he believed &s;he was happy, that he had re&s;olution enough to ob&s;erve this conduct.</P>
<P>Seymour, by unremitted efforts, con|cealed the &s;tate of his mind from Char|lotte. All her un&s;u&s;pecting heart per|ceived, was his re&s;erve towards Julia, for which &s;he could not account; but which gave her unea&s;ine&s;s; and with the frank|ne&s;s natural to her di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he &s;ome|times complained to him of his inatten|tion to her cou&s;in, and reminded him of particular in&s;tances of neglect; which he generally excu&s;ed, by ob&s;erving that he had been wholly occupied by her&s;elf.
<PB N="122" REF="125">
Charlotte once mentioned to Julia &s;ome|thing of Seymour's inattention to her. Julia coloured violently; Charlotte thought it the blu&s;h of re&s;entment, and &s;aid no more on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Had Mr. Clifford been a man of much ob&s;ervation, it is probable he would have remarked the change in Seymour's be|haviour to his niece. But Mr. Clifford paid little attention to the minuter traits of manners, and being at pre&s;ent wholly occupied in arranging his affairs, previou&s;|ly to his daughter's marriage, and im|proving the grounds round his hou&s;e, the &s;en&s;ations of Seymour's mind were by him entirely unnoticed. Mr. Clifford was delighted to &s;ee his lawns a&s;&s;ume a brighter verdure; his &s;hrubbery filled with every plant that could embelli&s;h it; his woods affording the mo&s;t venerable &s;hade, or opening into vi&s;tas, that pre&s;ented the mo&s;t &s;ublime land&s;cape&mdash;and was un|con&s;cious, that to the wounded &s;pirit of Seymour, nature had lo&s;t her beauty, and
<PB N="123" REF="126">
the earth its plea&s;antne&s;s!&mdash;Mr. Clifford was in the &s;ituation of one of tho&s;e &s;hel|tered trees, which grew in his own culti|vated vallies, protected from the violence of the winds, and feeling only the gen|tle&s;t influence of the &s;ea&s;ons; while the unhappy Seymour, agitated by the utmo&s;t violence of conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, re&s;embled one of tho&s;e plants which are &s;cattered on the bleak mountains, undefended, and expo&s;ed to all the fury of the elements.</P>
<P>Seymour was &s;ometimes thrown into great perturbation, by the ob&s;ervations which Chartres, in the &s;implicity of his mind, made upon his conduct. One evening, when there were &s;ome company from the neighbourhood, Seymour was relating, at the tea-table, a ludicrous ad|venture which had happened to him in France, and which he embelli&s;hed with all the graces of wit and fancy. While he was proceeding with great vivacity, a &s;ervant came, and &s;poke to Julia; upon which &s;he immediately left the room.
<PB N="124" REF="127">
Seymour fancied he &s;aw her change colour as &s;he went out; and occupied in conjec|turing what could be the rea&s;on of it, he made a pau&s;e in his &s;tory.&mdash;"Pray go on," &s;aid Charlotte.&mdash;He re&s;umed the narrative, but Chartres almo&s;t in&s;tantly interrupted him, &s;aying, "I beg your pardon Sir, but you have not begun at the place where you left off, and the parts of the &s;tory have lo&s;t their connection: you know Sir <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">" Chartres then added a Latin quotation of &s;ome length, which we believe was very appo&s;ite; but which, as we are entirely ignorant of Latin, we mu&s;t leave our learned readers to gue&s;s. While Chartres was di&s;playing his erudition, Seymour recovered him&s;elf &s;ufficiently to proceed in his narrative; but the tone of his voice was changed; the &s;pirit of the &s;tory evaporated; and when it was fini&s;hed, every body appeared di&s;appointed: and though this is a circum&s;tance which often happens to the retailers of &s;tories, many people having an everla&s;ting propen&s;ity to
<PB N="125" REF="128">
&s;peak, from the want of &s;ufficient under|&s;tanding to be &s;ilent, Seymour, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable talents for narration, was accu&s;tomed to be heard with applau&s;e. He perceived the di&s;appointment of the company, and added, in a confu&s;ed man|ner, "I have done my adventure great inju&s;tice; but a di&s;agreeable recollection came acro&s;s me, and I could not for my &s;oul get rid of it."&mdash;Julia returned ju&s;t as he had done &s;peaking, and Char|tres, who thought, that after Seymour's own confe&s;&s;ion that he had &s;poiled the je&s;t, there could be no impropriety in his avow|ing the &s;ame opinion, told Julia, that &s;he had not lo&s;t the mo&s;t agreeable part of the &s;tory; "for, ma'am," added he, "Mr. Seymour gave us no more wit after you left the room." Julia tried to &s;mile, and Seymour walked to the window, af|fecting to join in the general laugh, which was u&s;ually excited by the &s;olemn tone in which Chartres delivered his &s;entiments. The company pre&s;ent were not remarkable
<PB N="126" REF="129">
for penetration, and were more occupied by the awkward formality of the young man's manner, than by the force of his remark. There was, however, one lady of the party, who&s;e ob&s;ervation was more acute than that of her companions. Mi&s;s Tomkins had perceived an unaccountable degree of re&s;traint in the behaviour of Seymour and Julia towards each other. She had remarked, that Seymour faultered in his &s;tory upon Julia's leaving the room; but the effect which Chartres &s;peech had had upon them both, betrayed at once to Mi&s;s Tomkins a &s;ecret, which &s;he carefully trea&s;ured up in her own mind, and of which &s;he made a mo&s;t ungenerous u&s;e, as will be &s;een hereafter.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the company went to cards, and Chartres followed Seymour to the win|dow; who turned towards him with &s;uch a re&s;entful air, that Chartres, terrified at the thoughts of having given offence to one whom he &s;o highly re&s;pected, began in an audible voice to &s;olicit pardon. "I am
<PB N="127" REF="130">
heartily &s;orry, Mr. Seymour," &s;aid he, "if I have made any comment on the &s;tory that is offen&s;ive to you; but I thought Mi&s;s Julia Clifford would like to hear, that as it grew le&s;s agreeable ju&s;t as &s;he left the room, &s;he had not lo&s;t much by going. I feel an innocent &s;atisfaction in &s;aying any thing that will plea&s;e her, when I have an opportunity." "Pray, Mr. Char|tres, talk no more of it," Seymour replied, in an impatient and di&s;turbed manner. After pau&s;ing a little, he added, "I am not very well this evening; will you come and take a walk with me?" Chartres thankfully con&s;ented. Seymour burthen|ed him&s;elf with this young man's compa|ny, becau&s;e he was afraid, that if left with the ladies, Chartres might make &s;ome far|ther animadver&s;ions on the &s;tory; but he excu&s;ed him&s;elf from conver&s;ing with his companion on pretence of indi&s;po&s;ition; and wandering along the rocky &s;hores of the lake, indulged his own gloomy medi|tations.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="131">
Julia longed to take a walk; but &s;he confined her&s;elf to the corner of the card|table, becau&s;e &s;he dreaded meeting Sey|mour. When he returned, &s;he retired for a &s;hort time to her own apartment, and gave way to that &s;orrow which the per|plexity of her &s;ituation wrung from her heart. She was indeed per&s;uaded, that &s;he felt no other unea&s;ine&s;s than what aro&s;e from the agitation with which &s;he per|ceived that Seymour's mind was &s;trug|gling; but perhaps there was &s;omething of &s;elf-deception in this young lady's reflec|tions; as to a pa&s;&s;enger, in a boat that glides rapidly down a &s;tream, the current only appears to move, and the boat &s;eems perfectly &s;till, while in reality the waves bear it impetuou&s;ly along.</P>
<P>But whatever were Julia's real &s;en|&s;ations, her conduct was irreproachable. Her ideas of rectitude were of the mo&s;t exalted kind; and no pain would have been &s;o in&s;ufferable to her pure and feel|ing bo&s;om, as the conciou&s;ne&s;s of hav|ing
<PB N="129" REF="132">
in the &s;malle&s;t degree deviated from tho&s;e principles of delicacy, truth, inte|grity, and honour, which were not only the inviolable &s;entiments of her &s;oul, but the &s;tedfa&s;t rules of her actions. If her heart was not quite at peace, its exqui&s;ite &s;en|&s;ibility was corrected by the influence of rea&s;on; as the quivering needle, though &s;ubject to &s;ome variations, &s;till tends to one fixed point.</P>

<P>MR. and Mrs. Seymour, and Mrs. Melbourne, returned to Mr. Clif|ford's &s;eat, where they had promi&s;ed to pa&s;s a week or two on their way home. It was the time of the a&s;&s;izes at <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and Mrs. Seymour heard with great &s;atisfaction that Mr. Clifford's fa|mily were going to a ball at that town the following evening.</P>
<P>Mr. Chartres, on the fir&s;t intelligence he received of the ball, in&s;tantly a&s;ked Ju|lia to dance: "I own," added he, play|ing all the time with his fingers, and look|ing very fooli&s;h, for he felt that his re|que&s;t was a bold one; "I own I &s;hall appear but aukward, having never been at any ball, except my dancing-ma&s;ter's; but I am determined to improve my&s;elf
<PB N="131" REF="134">
in dancing, which I think a very plea&s;ant device, and what reflects honour on the inventor." Some young ladies, as &s;ecure as Julia of having their choice of many partners, would have refu&s;ed Mr. Chartres without much remor&s;e; but it was not in her nature to exert power in giving pain when it could be avoided; and though &s;he di&s;liked her &s;hackles, &s;he determined to wear them with chearfulne&s;s. Frederick Seymour was &s;ecretly rejoiced that Julia was engaged to Chartres, being con&s;cious that, had &s;he been provided with a more agreeable partner, it would have given him &s;ome very unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>Charlotte mentioned to Mrs. Seymour, at dinner, that &s;he would probably meet her acquaintance, Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, at the ball. "Mi&s;s Tomkins", added &s;he, "who is on a vi&s;it at Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">'s &s;eat, told me that Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> was expected this evening; and what will he do, Julia, when he finds you are engaged?&mdash;Mr. Chartres, I advi&s;e you not to be too happy to-mor|row,
<PB N="132" REF="135">
for I have a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion that you will be robbed of your partner." "I am con&s;cious, Madam," &s;aid Chartres, laying down his knife and fork with great &s;olem|nity, "I am very con&s;cious of my unwor|thine&s;s of Mi&s;s Julia Clifford, and you know, Madam," continued he, turning to Julia "I offered this morning to give up the honour of your hand to Mr. Frede|rick Seymour, for a dance or two, if he &s;hould happen to a&s;k it." Julia coloured violently; but it was not perceived by any one pre&s;ent except Mr. Seymour; for Frederick Seymour, at that moment, &s;pilt a gla&s;s of wine as he was putting it to his lips, on Charlotte's gown, and occa&s;ioned &s;ome confu&s;ion. Charlotte again renewed the &s;ubject of the ball, and Julia, who &s;aw that Mr. Seymour's penetrating eyes were fixed upon her, endeavoured to conquer her embarra&s;&s;ment. Mrs. Seymour a&s;ked her, if the ball-room at <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> was a good one. "Yes," replied Julia; "but it &s;eems rather &s;trange, &s;ince the time of the a&s;|&s;izes
<PB N="133" REF="136">
is cho&s;en for particular gaiety, that the town-hou&s;e &s;hould be made to contain both the a&s;&s;embly-room and the pri&s;on: they &s;eem placed with little judgment &s;o near each other." "I believe," &s;aid Mr. Seymour, "the mirth of the company in general will not be much di&s;turbed by this reflection, though it comes very na|turally from the per&s;on who made it." "A ball-room," &s;aid Frederick Seymour, "divided only by a thin partition from a pri&s;on, reminds one of a magical lanthorn, where all the gay colours are thrown on one little &s;pot, and every thing round it is involved in complete darkne&s;s." "Well, pray talk no more of it," &s;aid Charlotte." "Indeed," cried Mrs. Sey|mour, with a &s;igh loud enough to be heard by all pre&s;ent, "my feelings are &s;o wounded by what has pa&s;&s;ed, that I am &s;ure I &s;hall be mi&s;erable the whole even|ing; and I mu&s;t beg of you, Mi&s;s Clif|ford, to excu&s;e my going." "O no," re|plied Charlotte, "I will not excu&s;e you."
<PB N="134" REF="137">
Mrs. Seymour acquie&s;ced in &s;ilence, and expre&s;&s;ed no farther de&s;ire of remaining at home.</P>
<P>The next morning Charlotte propo&s;ed a ride. A carriage was ordered for Mrs. Melbourne, and hor&s;es for the re&s;t of the company, immediately after breakfa&s;t; when Charlotte ob&s;erved that Julia looked pale. "I have a &s;light head-ach," &s;aid Julia, "and as I intend to dance a great deal at the ball, I hope you will excu&s;e my going out with you this morning," "Certainly," &s;aid Charlotte, "if you wi&s;h it; but I am &s;ure you will be quite well in the evening; I never had a head-ach but once, when I was going to a ball, and the &s;ound of the fiddles carried it off directly." Julia &s;miled at her cou&s;in's remedy for the head-ach, and left the room.</P>
<P>She retired to her own apartment for an hour, and then wandered to a wood on the &s;ide of a neighbouring hill, completely &s;haded from the &s;un by thick intervoven
<PB N="135" REF="138">
trees. She &s;eated her&s;elf on a green bank, at the foot of an old oak: the lake was &s;een, and the &s;ound of the torrent was heard foaming down the cliffs at a di&s;|tance. The trees formed a thou&s;and wild avenues, and the paths of the wood appeared as if they had never been trod|den by any human foot-&s;tep. Julia, in this &s;olitude, found "room for medita|tion even to madne&s;s." She recalled the beloved image of her father; &s;he thought of the pa&s;t with tender regret, and the pre&s;ent &s;eemed involved in perplexity and &s;adne&s;s.</P>
<P>The beauties of the land&s;cape at length &s;oothed and elevated her mind. She lifted her eyes to heaven, for her admiration of the works of nature was ever accompanied with emotions of gratitude and prai&s;e; her heart became full&mdash;her tears flowed fa&s;t, but not painfully&mdash;when her reverie was di&s;turbed by the ru&s;tling of the leaves near her. She looked round, and &s;aw Frederick Seymour almo&s;t clo&s;e to her,
<PB N="136" REF="139">
and gazing at her with earne&s;tne&s;s. It in&s;tantly occurred to her, that &s;ome acci|dent had happened, and occa&s;ioned the return of the party; and &s;he enquired with eagerne&s;s and terror the rea&s;on of his coming. He told her, in a confu&s;ed man|ner, that he had received letters, after &s;he left the room, which required an imme|diate an&s;wer, and had obliged him to re|main at home. The truth was, that no &s;ooner had Julia declared her intention of &s;taying at home, than Frederick Sey|mour, who di&s;liked his &s;i&s;ter-in-law, and abhorred Mrs. Melbourne, felt a great di&s;gu&s;t at the thoughts of going. A few minutes after Julia quitted the room, let|ters were brought to him by the po&s;t, and he could not re&s;i&s;t the temptation they of|fered him of pretending that they requir|ed an immediate an&s;wer, and of de&s;iring, on that account, to be excu&s;ed joining the party on hor&s;eback. He was &s;en&s;ible that he was acting in direct oppo&s;ition to every rule he had pre&s;cribed for his con|duct;
<PB N="137" REF="140">
he felt that it was madne&s;s to court that dangerous &s;ociety, which had already proved &s;o fatal to his peace; but the &s;en&s;ations which impelled him to re|main behind, were too powerful to be combated by any effort of his rea&s;on. Alas! there <HI>are</HI> moments when the exertions of rea&s;on are ineffectually op|po&s;ed to the violence of pa&s;&s;ion!&mdash;there <HI>are</HI> moments in which pa&s;&s;ion, like the ocean-flood, overthrows the mounds which were oppo&s;ed to its progre&s;s!&mdash;Char|lotte, with her u&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s, accepted Seymour's apology for not attending her in her ride, and went with the re&s;t of the company.</P>
<P>When Julia di&s;covered that Seymour had not joined the party, a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his motive for declining it took in&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind. Surpri&s;e gave place to embarra&s;&s;ment, and a deep blu&s;h, which over&s;pread her face, betrayed what was pa&s;&s;ing in her brea&s;t. She remained &s;ilent.&mdash;"Are you angry with me," &s;aid
<PB N="138" REF="141">
he, in a faultering voice, "for intruding upon your &s;olitude?&mdash;My letters were fini&s;hed; I was going to walk; and was it po&s;&s;ible for me to turn my &s;teps another way, when I knew you were here?"&mdash;Julia had by this time recovered from her pain|ful confu&s;ion. Without taking notice of what he had been &s;aying, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her regret at having lo&s;t the morning's ride. "The day", added &s;he, "is &s;o fa|vourable, that the pro&s;pect from the hills will be &s;een to particular advantage." "I am &s;orry you regret it," he replied; "I have no &s;uch &s;en&s;ation&mdash;but may the intere&s;t which all who know Mi&s;s Clifford mu&s;t feel in her happine&s;s, give me a right to enquire into the cau&s;e of tho&s;e tears which only cea&s;ed upon my intru&s;ion, and which I would &s;acrifice my life to wipe away?" "Indeed," &s;aid Julia, quickening her pace towards the hou&s;e, "my tears were nothing more than a movement of admiration at the view of nature: the &s;olitude and grandeur of the
<PB N="139" REF="142">
&s;cene affected me, and my tears flowed, becau&s;e I felt plea&s;ure in &s;hedding them." "Oh," exclaimed he, with pa&s;&s;ionate vehemence, "may your t&eacute;ars never pro|ceed from any other &s;ource than that of plea&s;ure! May you, mo&s;t &aacute;miable of women, be happy, and I can never be quite mi&s;erable!"&mdash;"What &s;trange lan|guage is this! Mr. Seymour," &s;he an&s;wer|ed, in a tone of re&s;entment. "I &s;u&s;pect, Sir," &s;he added, "that your letters this morning have conveyed &s;ome di&s;agreea|ble intelligence; you appear di&s;ordered. If you will return to the &s;pot I have ju&s;t quitted, you will find its &s;tillne&s;s more favourable to compo&s;ure of mind than any company whatever." "Ah, Mi&s;s Clif|ford," re&s;umed he, "if I may never hope for compo&s;ure of mind, but in a &s;pot which <HI>you</HI> have ju&s;t quitted, how poor is my chance of attaining tranquillity!" They reached at that moment a little cottage which &s;tood between two hills: a clear rivulet ran along the narrow valley, and
<PB N="140" REF="143">
a plank was thrown acro&s;s it. A young man was re&s;ting him&s;elf on the gra&s;s be|fore the door of the cottage; his elde&s;t child &s;tood behind him, peeping over his &s;houlder at a younger infant, who was placed upon his knees; his wife, a pretty clean young woman, &s;at at work on the root of an old elm. Joy &s;parkled in the looks of the whole family at the approach of Julia. She had &s;pent the pa&s;t winter in relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the neighbouring poor, and, "when the eye &s;aw her it ble&s;&s;ed her!"&mdash;She &s;topped a few mi|nutes to &s;peak to the cottagers, and then ha&s;tened towards home. "What a charming picture of dome&s;tic enjoyment we have ju&s;t &s;een!" exclaimed Seymour, with enthu&s;ia&s;m. "If in the higher ranks of life we were not the &s;laves of the world, what other &s;cheme of happine&s;s could be &s;o precious to a heart endued with &s;en&s;ibi|lity, as that which this family groupe di&s;|plays?"&mdash;Julia was &s;ilent.&mdash;"But then," he continued, with increa&s;ed ea|gerne&s;s,
<PB N="141" REF="144">
"the world can only be renounced with plea&s;ure for the object of all others mo&s;t dear to the affections. It mu&s;t be a connection not formed from intere&s;t, from a combination of circum&s;tances, which entangle the mind, and warp its inclina|tions; it mu&s;t be the free election of the &s;oul! What felicity to live for one be|loved object, to prevent every wi&s;h, to &s;tudy every look, to anticipate every de|&s;ire!&mdash;And in that beloved object, to di&s;|cern fidelity never to be &s;haken, even in the greate&s;t conflicts and convul&s;ions of fortune; to meet with everla&s;ting &s;upport and &s;ympathy, with the charm of un|bounded confidence, the&mdash;" "No more Sir," &s;aid Julia, interrupting him, "I have no plea&s;ure in being led into the regions of romance." "By the happy," he replied, "the dream of imagination may be di&s;carded; but it is the refuge of mi&s;ery, and&mdash;" "To me," &s;aid Julia, again interrupting him, "the language of di&s;content never appears more unrea&s;on|able
<PB N="142" REF="145">
than amid&s;t &s;uch beautiful &s;cenes as the&s;e, which &s;eem formed to in&s;pire tranquillity." "Complaint," re&s;umed he, vehemently, "has indeed no language which can convey an adequate idea of my peculiar wretchedne&s;s." Julia made no reply, but walked as fa&s;t as &s;he was able. Seymour pre&s;erved a gloomy &s;ilence till they came to the lawn before the hou&s;e. While they were cro&s;&s;ing the lawn, he &s;aid, in a low voice, "I fear I have offended you, from your evident anxiety to get rid of me: Ah! I acknowledge the infatuation, the madne&s;s of this intru|&s;ion!&mdash;could I dare to expect, could I even hope for your &s;ympathy!&mdash;Oh no! I am not &s;uch a wretch as to wi&s;h that your peace &s;hould be a moment di&s;turbed by any pity for the wretchedne&s;s, the ex|treme&mdash;I know not what I am &s;ay|ing.&mdash;Forgive me, Madam; forgive the incoherent expre&s;&s;ions of a di&s;tracted mind&mdash;I will not offend again!&mdash;never &s;hall your ear again be wounded by my com|plaints;
<PB N="143" REF="146">
I will &s;uffer in &s;ilence."&mdash;He opened the door of the &s;aloon. Julia en|tered without &s;peaking, made him a &s;light curte&s;y as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed him, and ha&s;t|ened to her own apartment. He looked after her till &s;he was out of &s;ight, and then wandered to a di&s;tant &s;cene, uncon&s;cious where he was going, and ab&s;orbed in profound melancholy.</P>
<P>Julia for &s;ome time gave way to tears; but &s;he wiped the traces of &s;orrow from her eyes before the return of Charlotte, and determined to decline no parties in future, however di&s;agreeable to her, that &s;he might not again be expo&s;ed to an in|terview &s;o painful to her feelings, as that which had ju&s;t pa&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Charlotte returned from her ride, her fir&s;t care was to ha&s;ten to Julia's apartment, and enquire if her head-ach had cea&s;ed. At that mo|ment Julia felt Charlotte's kindne&s;s like a reproach; her heart was full, and tears &s;tarted into her eyes. "What is the matter, my deare&s;t friend?" &s;aid Char|lotte: &s;he then enquired if it was the thoughts of going for the fir&s;t time into public &s;ince the death of her father that affected her. Julia now wept without re|&s;traint. "If you are &s;o much hurt at go|ing, my deare&s;t girl," re&s;umed Charlotte, "I will not in&s;i&s;t upon it."&mdash;Fearing, how|ever, that if &s;he remained at home, Frede|rick Seymour would attribute it to the ef|fects of their meeting, Julia told Char|lotte
<PB N="145" REF="148">
that &s;he was determined to go, and begged that &s;he would take no notice to any one of the depre&s;&s;ion of her &s;pirits. Charlotte threw her arms round her friend's neck, and embraced her tenderly, with the mo&s;t &s;oothing expre&s;&s;ions of af|fection. They then parted, in order to dre&s;s for the ball.</P>
<P>When Charlotte left the room, Julia threw her&s;elf on her knees, and implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that Being, to whom &s;he had been ever accu&s;tomed to fly, as to the refuge of calamity. Her heart was formed for devotion, and the con&s;olation it afforded her will be only di&s;believed by tho&s;e who have never tried its influence.&mdash;The&s;e young ladies appeared at dinner dre&s;&s;ed alike, and with the mo&s;t graceful &s;implicity. Julia's complexion was a lit|tle flu&s;hed by the agitation &s;he had &s;uf|fered, which &s;erved to heighten her beauty; and Charlotte gazed at her with as &s;incere delight as if &s;he had not been hand&s;omer than her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="149">
Mrs. Seymour was very fanta&s;tically arrayed, and her &s;en&s;ations at the ap|pearance of Julia were of a very oppo&s;ite nature from tho&s;e which glowed in the generous bo&s;om of Charlotte. Mrs. Mel|bourne al&s;o di&s;covered by her looks, and by more than u&s;ual peevi&s;hne&s;s of man|ner, her entire di&s;approbation of the in|crea&s;ed bloom of Julia's complexion, who was placed at dinner between Mr. Sey|mour and Chartres. "Did you take a long walk this morning, Ma'am?" &s;aid Char|tres. "No, a very &s;hort one," replied Julia. "Why, walking <HI>alone</HI> is dull enough," &s;aid Mr. Seymour, looking at her earne&s;tly. "I do not think &s;o," an|&s;wered Julia; "but I was not alone, I met Mr. Frederick Seymour." "Oh, &s;o he found you out, Ma'am," exclaimed Char|tres: "well, I really thought you would have hid your&s;elf; for, although woman, as well as man, is certainly a &s;ocial being, yet there are &s;ea&s;ons when &s;olitude is more valuable than &s;ociety." "What does
<PB N="147" REF="150">
Mr. Chartres &s;ay about hiding your&s;elf, Julia?" &s;aid Charlotte, who was &s;itting at &s;ome di&s;tance. "He &s;ays," replied Mr. Seymour, "that your fair cou&s;in is very cruel, and &s;tays at home to hide her&s;elf mo&s;t maliciou&s;ly from us, who live only in her &s;ight." Julia &s;miled faintly, and Mr. Seymour immediately changed the &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>While they were at tea, Mr. Seymour de&s;cribed with rapture the falls of the river Clyde, which he had vi&s;ited in his tour through Scotland. Mrs. Seymour &s;aid, &s;he had been particularly plea&s;ed with the romantic beauties of the river Evan, as it runs through Hamilton Wood, pa&s;&s;ing by Chat'lherault, to join the Clyde, at a bridge in &s;ight of Hamilton Hou&s;e. But what, added &s;he, perhaps, impre&s;&s;ed the beauties of that &s;pot upon my mind more &s;trongly than tho&s;e of any other, was &s;ome ver&s;es which were given to me by a lady in that neighbourhood, and
<PB N="148" REF="151">
which, &s;he told me, were written by two intimate friends of her own, in their days of court&s;hip. I took a copy of the ver&s;es, together with a little account of the writers, which their friend had &s;crawled on a blank leaf of the paper. Charlotte begged Mrs. Seymour would produce the ver&s;es; which &s;he did immediately, and de&s;ired Mr. Frederick Seymour to read them. He took the paper, and read as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">A young gentleman, born on the banks of the Evan in Scotland, had formed a &s;trong attachment to a young lady in that neighbourhood; but for|tune refu&s;ing even that competency, which would have &s;atisfied two min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s equally dive&s;ted of ambition and avarice, he accepted of an offer of going to the Ea&s;t Indies. Time and di&s;tance had no power to obliterate the traces of a &s;acred and &s;erious pa&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as may perhaps &s;till be found in the bo&s;om of
<PB N="149" REF="152">
retirement. On the banks of the Gan|ges his imagination often wandered to that humbler, but, in his mind, far more beautiful &s;tream, which winds in delightful mazes through the wood of Hamilton, and who&s;e banks, of a ro|mantic height, are covered with the fre&s;he&s;t verdure, and crowned with trees of the mo&s;t venerable antiquity. This had been the &s;cene of his early pa&s;&s;ion. Under the &s;hade of tho&s;e maje&s;tic trees, by the brink of that beloved &s;tream, he had often wandered with his mi&s;tre&s;s; and in his mind, every impre&s;&s;ion of beauty, and every idea of happine&s;s, was connected with the borders of the Evan.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">With &s;uch feelings, it is not &s;ur|pri&s;ing that, having acquired a fortune far greater than would have been &s;uf|ficient to have fixed him in the arms of love and happine&s;s in his native coun|try, he immediately determined to re|turn. A &s;hort time before his departure,
<PB N="150" REF="153">
he compo&s;ed the following &s;ong; and &s;ome years after his return; he acci|dentally found a little ballad, which his mi&s;tre&s;s had written during their &s;epa|ration; an unequivocal proof, among many he daily experienced, that their love was reciprocal.</Q></P>

"The tricks of execution," he added, "may &s;urprize, but are too remote from nature to touch the pa&s;&s;ions: they are more ea&s;ily moved by &s;triking one tender &s;tring, than by flying through all the notes of the gamut."

<P>MR. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, who came to pay his compliments to Mrs. Seymour, on her entering the a&s;&s;embly-room, &s;oon directed his principal attention to Julia, and obtained her permi&s;&s;ion to a&s;k Mr. Chartres to re&s;ign her hand for one dance. Mrs. Seymour had no time to be out of humour at Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s attention to Julia, being immediately a&s;ked to dance by Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and after that &s;he felt no inclination; for, if the female brow is ever clouded by ill-temper, it is cer|tainly not in tho&s;e moments when vanity is gratified.</P>
<P>Frederick Seymour danced with Char|lotte, and Julia with Chartres; who wore a look of great &s;olicitude, while by the mo&s;t &s;erious and unremitting attention he
<PB N="157" REF="160">
made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the figure of each country dance, before he began to prac|ti&s;e it. His performance of his le&s;&s;on was, however, &s;omewhat ludicrous. He flung out his arms and legs in a very &s;ingular manner, and, by his indefatigable efforts to dance with &s;pirit, afforded infinite diver&s;ion to the whole company. This young man, whom nature had formed more on the plan of the yew than the o&s;ier, had, while dancing, rather the appearance of a puppet than of a human form; for his figure &s;eemed to be framed of wood, and his movements directed by wires: but he believed that extended arms denoted ea&s;e, and that a high &s;pring demon&s;trated &s;pirit; while, in truth, his performance was as remote from either, as the &s;tiff ringlets of our learned coun&s;ellors wigs, (tho&s;e &s;tupendous &s;ymbols of knowledge,) from the graceful flow of natural curls. Julia alone appeared in&s;en&s;ible to the awkward motions of her partner, becau&s;e &s;he was not willing to give him pain. She
<PB N="158" REF="161">
&s;aw that he ob&s;erved, with mortification, the tittering of the young ladies whenever he approached; and &s;he determined to appear perfectly &s;atisfied with his abilities for dancing; though &s;ometimes, when he &s;prang unu&s;ually high, with out-&s;tretch'd arms, &s;he found it difficult to &s;uppre&s;s a &s;mile.</P>
<P>Mr. Charters, after the labour of two dances, which, by his mode of perform|ance, had been rendered no trifling fa|tigue, con&s;ented to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of his toils, and re&s;igned his partner to Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, for one dance; telling her, "That he would &s;it in the mean time, and medi|tate on the pa&s;time before him, which he thought was very delightful to behold." Frederick Seymour knew nothing of this arrangement till he &s;aw them &s;tanding up together. He had per&s;uaded Charlotte to &s;it down during that dance, and, as the ball-room was very hot, &s;he propo&s;ed going to the card-room, where Seymour was leading her when he fir&s;t perceived
<PB N="159" REF="162">
Julia and Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> . He felt a pang of jealous angui&s;h at the &s;ight, and an irre|&s;i&s;tible de&s;ire to ob&s;erve their behaviour to each other. Suppre&s;&s;ing his emotion, he turned to Charlotte, with as much carele&s;&s;ne&s;s in his manner as he could a&s;|&s;ume, and &s;aid, "This is a very lively tune, and, if I thought you could forgive me for being &s;o whim&s;ical, I &s;hould con|fe&s;s that I feel a great inclination to go down this dance." "And &s;o do I too," replied Charlotte, ha&s;tening to her place, "it's a plea&s;ure to oblige you, when you chu&s;e to dance; but one really finds it dif|ficult to &s;it down; &s;o pray don't take that humour again."</P>
<P>After Julia and Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> had pa&s;&s;ed them in the dance, Frederick Seymour &s;aid to Charlotte, in a tone of indifference, "How has your fair cou&s;in contrived to get rid of her fir&s;t partner?" "She has only got rid of him for one dance," re|plied Charlotte. "Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> was mi|&s;erable when he heard &s;he was engaged,
<PB N="160" REF="163">
and was determined to dance one dance with her at lea&s;t: I can &s;ee," added Char|lotte, "that Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> is in love with Julia." Seymour felt that Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s love was a &s;ubject on which he was not likely to &s;peak with much &s;ucce&s;s, and therefore prudently forbore to make any reply.

<P>Mrs. Melbourne &s;at and contemplated Mrs. Seymour, while &s;he was dancing, with the fonde&s;t admiration. Her whole &s;tock of applau&s;e &s;he lavi&s;hed upon her daugh|ter; and at length, dazzled with the graces and attractions which &s;he perceived in this favourite object, &s;he turned her eyes for relief upon the re&s;t of the company, where &s;he ea&s;ily di&s;covered &s;ome &s;hades of imperfection; di&s;tributing the whole number of female defects among the
<PB N="161" REF="164">
young ladies pre&s;ent, and, with laudable impartiality, giving to each of them an equal &s;hare. Julia, who&s;e beauty eclip&s;ed that of all others, &s;he regarded with as much malignity as if &s;he had her&s;elf been her rival; held Mr. Clifford's under&s;tand|ing in the highe&s;t contempt, on account of his having received into his family one, who&s;e &s;uperior attractions mu&s;t ever bear away the palm from his own daughter; and was ready to exclaim to Charlotte, in the words of Shake&s;peare,
<Q><L>Thou art a fool, &s;he robs thee of thy name,</L>
<L>And thou wilt &s;how more bright when &s;he is gone.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Melbourne then reflected how much more &s;agaciou&s;ly &s;he would have acted in the &s;ame circum&s;tances; at what a prudent di&s;tance &s;he would have &s;e|parated a beautiful niece from her own daughter, by leaving her in that &s;afe ob&s;curity, where &s;he would have been &s;ecure from danger her&s;elf, and could nei|ther
<PB N="162" REF="165">
have excited admiration or envy in others.</P>
<P>Mr. Chartres, after the interval of repo&s;e he had enjoyed, felt him&s;elf prepared for fre&s;h exertions, and claimed his partner the next dance. Charlotte could not be per|fectly happy, even in dancing with her beloved Seymour, while &s;he &s;aw Julia de|voting the evening to &s;uch a partner as Chartres. The affectionate Charlotte had long made Julia's happine&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to her own. Her heart was attuned to joy; but when &s;he fancied Julia's was not in uni&s;on, the &s;trings of plea&s;ure in her own bo&s;om refu&s;ed to vibrate.</P>
<P>She propo&s;ed to Frederick Seymour, that he &s;hould a&s;k Chartres to allow him to dance one dance with Julia, and added, that &s;he her&s;elf would dance with Chartres "It will really divert me," &s;aid Char|lotte, "to go down one dance with him; and we &s;hall do va&s;tly well, for I'll make him get the figure by heart before we &s;et off." Seymour, however, appeared but

little diverted with Charlotte's plan, which threw him into &s;uch perturbation, that he &s;carcely knew what he &s;aid. "Yes&mdash;cer|tainly&mdash;if you wi&s;h it"&mdash;he replied, in a &s;tammering manner. "Surely it cannot be di&s;agreeable to you," rejoined Char|lotte, with &s;ome &s;urprize at his he&s;itation. No&mdash;I did not mean&mdash;I&mdash;&s;hall I go and a&s;k Mi&s;s Julia Clifford's permi&s;&s;ion?" "Certainly," an&s;wered Charlotte. He went up to Julia, a&s;ked her to dance, and added, in a low voice, that he &s;hould not have pre&s;umed to &s;olicit that honor, if Mi&s;s Charlotte Clifford had not command|ed him. Julia could alledge no pretence to Charlotte for refu&s;ing: &s;he therefore gave her con&s;ent, and he led her to the dance.

When the dance was fini&s;hed, Julia, followed by Frederick Seymour, went in &s;earch of Charlotte, who was at that moment &s;ur|rounded by a number of her acquaintances; and Julia could find no vacant place ex|cept

at a little di&s;tance, where &s;he &s;at down, and Frederick Seymour placed him&s;elf next her. He endeavoured to conver&s;e with her, but his powers of entertainment failed him, and her manner towards him was cold and di&s;tant.

<P>The company went to tea; and Mr. Chartres, who was con&s;cious that dancing was not his fort, determined at lea&s;t to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by his &s;ervices to the ladies during tea. He aro&s;e with great alacrity to hand &s;ome bread and butter; but no &s;ooner did he find him&s;elf &s;tanding upright, a public &s;pectacle to the whole circle, than all the excellent arguments, by which he had &s;purred his courage to this enterprize, &s;uddenly failed him, and his confu&s;ion was &s;o great, that it &s;eemed to bereave him of his faculties: he ha&s;tily placed his tea-cup upon the chair on which he had been &s;itting, and, while un|dergoing the pains of pre&s;enting the cake, let the plate &s;lip out of his trembling hand, which fell in pieces on the floor. Overcome with horror at this accident, he immedi|ately
<PB N="166" REF="169">
retreated to his chair, unmindful o the tea-cup which he had placed upon it, the contents of which now flowed up|on the ground. Mrs. Seymour fell into convul&s;ions of laughter, nor could Char|lotte re&s;i&s;t joining with her heartily. Ju|lia checked her inclination to laugh, in compa&s;&s;ion to poor Chartres, who&s;e whole face became &s;carlet, and who &s;uffered &s;uch torments of mind, that though his legs were a good deal &s;calded, he was for &s;ome time in&s;en&s;ible to his bodily pains; and when he did feel them, had not cou|rage either to complain or move from his &s;eat, till Frederick Seymour perceived his &s;ituation, and offered to accompany him to another apartment. When he had changed his &s;tockings, and felt his &s;uffer|ings a&s;&s;uaged, he complained bitterly, that Mrs. Seymour made no more con|&s;cience of laughing at him, than if he was not related to her by the ties of blood; and lamented that a man's zeal to &s;erve the mo&s;t amiable part of the cre|ation

&s;hould expo&s;e him to &s;uch di&s;|grace.</P>
<P>Mr. Seymour was not unemployed at the ball, though he did not dance, and forbore to play at whi&s;t, of which he was exceedingly fond. But lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> did not chu&s;e to play, which was Mr. Seymour's rea&s;on for declining it: he &s;eated him&s;elf next her, and exerted all his brilliant talents for her entertainment. She had been acquainted with him in London, and was &s;o dazzled by his wit, and &s;o charmed with the warmth and frankne&s;s of his manner, that he had gain|ed a high place in her admiration and e&s;teem: and he now contrived to blend &s;ome very delicate and agreeable flattery to her&s;elf in his remarks on the company. Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> was hand&s;ome, amiable, and not in&s;en&s;ible to prai&s;e, which was parti|cularly grateful to her from Mr. Sey|mour, becau&s;e &s;he re&s;pected his abilities, and had a firm per&s;ua&s;ion of his candour and &s;incerity. She believed, that had &s;he
<PB N="168" REF="171">
been in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure &s;ituation of life, he would have admired her as much, and loved her as fervently. She fancied that &s;he had made a powerful impre&s;&s;ion on his heart; and, notwith&s;tanding Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">'s di&s;po&s;ition was virtuous, and &s;he was determined never to deviate in e&s;&s;ential points from the duty &s;he owed to her hu&s;band, her early intercour&s;e with the fa&s;hionable world had given her mind a laxity in its opinions on the &s;ubject of gallantry, though it had not power intirely to pervert her principles. She thought there was no harm in a fine woman's in|&s;piring pa&s;&s;ion in other men as well as her hu&s;band; and in li&s;tening to the language of love, or even in feeling the &s;entiment in her own bo&s;om, &s;o long as her conduct was without reproach. Having hitherto walked &s;afely in a dangerous path, though it led along the edge of a precipice, &s;he had now lo&s;t the apprehen&s;ion of falling. Perhaps &s;he would have been in more danger from Mr. Seymour than any of
<PB N="169" REF="172">
her other admirers, becau&s;e he pur&s;ued the gratification of his pa&s;&s;ions with indefa|tigable per&s;everance, and with con&s;um|mate powers of in&s;inuation. But another object, with whom the reader will &s;hortly be acquainted, at pre&s;ent occupied his heart; and his &s;ole aim, in this tender at|tention to lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, was to obtain the exertion of her influence with her lord, which was very con&s;iderable, to procure Mr. Seymour &s;ome additional emoluments to the office he held under government. "Well," &s;aid &s;he, after they had con|ver&s;ed together a con&s;iderable time, "I mu&s;t leave you now&mdash;our <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> has been quite long enough." "Perhaps for <HI>you,</HI>" he replied, with a &s;igh. "No, indeed," interrupted lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, "I'm not at all tired of you; but, if I &s;tay any longer, the&s;e good country-folks will be making &s;ome obliging comments upon it." "What! on your chatting with an old married man." I think a <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> with &s;o harmle&s;s a creature as I am, can
<PB N="170" REF="173">
&s;carcely furni&s;h the go&s;&s;ips with a &s;ubject, notwith&s;tanding the dearth of conver&s;ation in the&s;e parts." "If I thought you <HI>were</HI> harmle&s;s," an&s;wered lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, "I &s;hould like your friend&s;hip of all things." This confe&s;&s;ion was followed by the mo&s;t pro|fu&s;e, tender, ardent profe&s;&s;ions of regard on the part of Mr. Seymour. Their plan of friend&s;hip was immediately fixed, and he took a future opportunity of di&s;clo&s;ing his political &s;cheme, at the moment when he &s;aw it would &s;ucceed; alledging &s;uch plau&s;ible rea&s;ons for the application, that &s;he had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion that it ori|ginated in the mo&s;t &s;ordid avarice. Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, who &s;carcely knew the value of money her&s;elf, was not aware that Mr. Seymour could never be convinced that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed enough, while there was any means left untried of obtaining more. Avarice is a pa&s;&s;ion as de&s;picable as it is hateful. It chu&s;es the mo&s;t in&s;idious means for the attainment of its ends: it dares not pur&s;ue its object with the bold

impetuo&s;ity of the &s;oaring eagle, but &s;kims the ground in narrow circles like the &s;wallow.</P>
<P>Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> danced with Mi&s;s Tom|kins; who, however, perceived that his whole thoughts were bent upon Julia; a di&s;covery which produced &s;en&s;ations of a very painful nature in the mind of Mi&s;s Tomkins, who had for &s;ome time formed a &s;erious matrimonial plot upon this gen|tleman, which &s;he now perceived would very probably be defeated. It is nece&s;|&s;ary to give a &s;hort &s;ketch of the charac|ter of this young lady.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Tomkins was of low birth. Her father had a plodding head, and rai&s;ed him&s;elf by unwearied diligence, and a con&s;tant and watchful attention to the main chance, from which nothing di|verted his thoughts a &s;ingle moment. He was one of tho&s;e per&s;ons whom Sterne de&s;cribes as walking &s;traight forward through the path of this world; turn|ing neither to the right hand, nor the
<PB N="172" REF="175">
left; and his application to bu&s;ine&s;s was at length rewarded by his obtaining the office of &s;teward to a nobleman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very con&s;iderable e&s;tate. His daugh|ter, who was at that time in her twenty|third year, was a young woman of &s;upe|rior under&s;tanding, and quick penetra|tion into character. She had received an excellent education; and her mind was highly cultivated. Her talents had intro|duced her into a re&s;pectable &s;ociety of the middle rank, perhaps the &s;ociety of all others from which the greate&s;t improve|ment may be derived; for the middle &s;tation of life appears to be that tempe|rate region, in which the mind, neither enervated by too full a ray from pro&s;pe|rity, nor chilled and deba&s;ed by the freezing bla&s;t of penury, is in the &s;ituation mo&s;t favourable for every great and generous exertion.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was her father appointed &s;teward to the earl of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, than Mi&s;s Tomkins perceived that a new and &s;plen|did
<PB N="173" REF="176">
career was opened to her ambition. The counte&s;s of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> invited her to &s;pend a &s;hort time at their country &s;eat. Mi&s;s Tomkins availed her&s;elf of this in|vitation with eagerne&s;s, and &s;oon made her&s;elf well acquainted with the character of lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, managed her foibles &s;kilfully, and in a &s;hort time became a great favourite, and a con&s;tant vi&s;itor at her hou&s;e. This acquaintance led to others of the &s;ame con&s;equence. Mi&s;s Tomkins's friend&s;hips were formed upon the calculations of intere&s;t: &s;he was aware that all her pro&s;pects of fortune depended upon her father's life, and was anxious to provide farther &s;ecurities of future afflu|ence, in ca&s;e this &s;hould fail. But &s;he concealed the utmo&s;t &s;ubtlety of worldly policy, under the appearance of the great|e&s;t di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and the mo&s;t tender and genuine &s;en&s;ibility. Among her friends, &s;he could number many people of talents, as well as rank; for her real cha|racter was only known to a few, to whom
<PB N="174" REF="177">
long acquaintance had developed it; but tho&s;e few had too much honour to betray her, and felt more contempt than indig|nation at her total neglect of them, now &s;he was introduced into an higher circle.</P>
<P>Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> was a frequent vi&s;itor at the hou&s;e of her patrone&s;s. Mi&s;s Tom|kins found that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed accompli&s;h|ments &s;ufficient to gratify her pride, and a fortune ample enough to &s;atisfy her am|bition. He had appeared plea&s;ed with her conver&s;ation, and &s;he hoped, in the cour&s;e of a few weeks pa&s;&s;ed with him at lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">'s &s;eat, to confirm her empire over his heart; when the &s;uperior attractions of Julia at once defeated all her projects. How often do we build a gay palace in the air, decorate it with gold and purple, and almo&s;t fancy the foundation is a &s;ub&s;tan|tial one; till a pa&s;&s;ing breeze &s;hakes the fair fabric, and &s;carcely leaves even a broken pillar on which the imagination may re&s;t!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<P>A Few days after the ball, lord and lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, Mi&s;s Tomkins, and Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, were invited to dinner at Mr. Clifford's. Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> devoted his whole attention to Julia, which Mrs Sey|mour was in no di&s;po&s;ition to witne&s;s with the &s;ame complacency &s;he had done at the ball; for lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> was placed next another lady, and the other gentlemen at table were plain country &s;quires.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Tomkins affected to di&s;tingui&s;h Julia with particular fondne&s;s, in order to conceal the envy and aver&s;ion which rankled in her heart. The pain &s;he felt in making this effort, was perhaps a &s;ufficient puni&s;hment for her malignity; and it would have co&s;t her le&s;s trouble to con|quer
<PB N="176" REF="179">
tho&s;e bad pa&s;&s;ions, than it did to hide them from ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Charlotte entertained her gue&s;ts in the mo&s;t engaging manner. Her &s;weet coun|tenance beamed with good-humour and vivacity; nor had &s;he a &s;u&s;picion that any of her company were &s;trangers to that con&s;cious &s;erenity which filled her own gentle bo&s;om. The pure and delicate &s;en&s;ations of a fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, which is op|po&s;ed by no duty, and embittered by no ob&s;tacle, &s;hed over the mind a &s;weet en|chantment, that renders every object agreeable, and every moment delightful: it is like that fir&s;t fre&s;h and vivid green which the early &s;pring awakens; that lovely and tender verdure which is not found amid&s;t the glow of &s;ummer, and is as tran&s;itory as it is charming.</P>
<P>Julia felt nothing but indifference for Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">; but &s;he &s;aw that her beha|viour was watched by Mr. Seymour, and was glad to avoid his &s;crutinizing looks,
<PB N="177" REF="180">
by engaging in conver&s;ation with that gentleman; which &s;he did with an ap|pearance of plea&s;ure that threw Frederick Seymour into the utmo&s;t perturbation. This did not pa&s;s unnoticed by his brother, who had di&s;covered, from many little cir|cum&s;tances &s;ince his arrival, that unhappy &s;ecret which Frederick Seymour thought was concealed from all ob&s;ervation. Mr. Seymour, however, determined to make no other u&s;e of his di&s;covery than that of ha&s;tening, as far as was in his power, his brother's marriage with Charlotte, which he con&s;idered as a connection too advan|tageous to be lo&s;t for any rea&s;on what|ever; nor did Mr. Seymour think that a pa&s;&s;ion for one woman was the &s;malle&s;t ob&s;tacle to a marriage with another. He was him&s;elf a libertine, both in principle and practice: he had conver&s;ed chiefly with the mo&s;t worthle&s;s part of the female &s;ex, and had conceived a very contempti|ble opinion of the principles of the female mind. He thought it was probable that
<PB N="178" REF="181">
Julia would &s;oon marry: he &s;aw, or fan|cied he &s;aw, that his brother was not per|fectly indifferent to her, and believed, that if he could not conquer his pa&s;&s;ion, he might at length find it returned.&mdash;Mr. Seymour's opinion was founded on his ob&s;ervation of Julia's extreme &s;en&s;ibility; but the conclu&s;ions of this rea&s;oner were drawn from fal&s;e premi&s;es: he did not know that in a mind where the principles of religion and integrity are firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, &s;en&s;ibility is not merely the ally of weakne&s;s, or the &s;lave of guilt, but &s;erves to give a &s;tronger impul&s;e to virtue; nor could his own mind, which was har|dened and deba&s;ed by the freedom of a licentious life, form a conjecture of that horror which the idea of vice excites in a pure and ingenuous bo&s;om. He did not know, that to a heart framed like that of Julia's, &s;elf-reproach would be the mo&s;t in&s;upportable of all evils; that &s;he had &s;ufficient fortitude to &s;u&s;tain any mi&s;ery that was not connected with guilt, and
<PB N="179" REF="182">
&s;ufficient rectitude never to &s;eparate the idea of plea&s;ure from that of virtue. Vir|tue is indeed the only true &s;upport of plea|&s;ure; which, when disjoined from it, is like a plant when its fibres are cut, which may &s;till look gay and lovely for a while, but &s;oon decays and peri&s;hes.</P>
<P>Mr. Seymour, who had a curio&s;ity to know if Chartres had any &s;u&s;picion of his brother's partiality for Julia, propo&s;ed a walk to him, and, after a little conver|&s;ation on other &s;ubjects, &s;aid to him, "Well, Mr. Chartres, is your heart in no danger among the&s;e fine young women? I &s;uppo&s;e you feel no &s;mall envy of my happy brother." "Why really, Sir," &s;aid Char|tres, "if I did not gue&s;s from my own feelings that it mu&s;t be a plea&s;ant thing to be on the point of marriage with Mi&s;s Charlotte Clifford, I &s;hould never find it out from Mr. Frederick Seymour; for, to tell you the truth, I think if he di&s;|liked the marriage, he would behave pre|ci&s;ely as he does now." "Did you ever
<PB N="180" REF="183">
make this remark to any one before?" "Yes, Sir; Mi&s;s Julia Clifford and I were walking together, a few days ago, as we ge|nerally do; for I believe Mr. Frederick Seymour would &s;ee her fall down a rock before he would offer to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, &s;o I have that honour; and perhaps I acquit my&s;elf but awkwardly, yet &s;he always &s;eems bet|ter &s;atisfied when I attend her, than when your brother offers his help. I really do not know how it has happened, Sir, but &s;he and Mr. Frederick Seymour &s;eem to have taken a great aver&s;ion to each other; Is it not very &s;trange?" "Very &s;trange indeed, Mr. Chartres," &s;aid Mr. Seymour drily, "that they &s;hould feel &s;o <HI>great</HI> an aver|&s;ion as you mention: but let me hear what pa&s;&s;ed in your walk with Mi&s;s Julia Clif|ford." Why, Sir, as we walked under the &s;hade of that woody hill near the hou&s;e, I heard Mi&s;s Julia &s;igh very deeply. "Pray, Ma'am," &s;aid I, "don't &s;igh &s;o heavily, <HI>you</HI> are not going to be married." "What do you mean, Mr. Chartres?" &s;aid &s;he.
<PB N="181" REF="184">
"Why, Ma'am," I replied, "what I meant was this, that Mr. Frederick Seymour, who <HI>is</HI> going to be married, does nothing but &s;igh all day long; that is, when he and I are alone together; for, when any of you appear, he &s;tarts up, rubs his eyes, and puts on quite another &s;ort of countenance. Now this behaviour &s;eems to me quite in|con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on, if he is happy; and by no means con&s;onant to philo&s;ophy, if he is otherwi&s;e." "Well Sir," &s;aid Mr. Sey|mour, "and what an&s;wer did the young lady make to the&s;e ob&s;ervations?" "Why, Sir, &s;he was &s;ilent &s;o long, that I thought &s;he was not going to an&s;wer at all; but at la&s;t, &s;he &s;aid, "that the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s which I had remarked was probably natural to Mr. Frederick Seymour's di&s;po&s;ition, &s;ince he had certainly great rea&s;on to be happy at pre&s;ent;" &s;he then begged I would not mention his fits of gravity to Charlotte, becau&s;e &s;uch intelligence would give her no plea&s;ure." "I entirely approve of Julia's advice," "&s;aid Mr. Seymour,
<PB N="182" REF="185">
"and therefore we will keep the &s;ecret to our&s;elves." "With all my heart, Sir," &s;aid Chartres; "I own this is the fir&s;t &s;e|cret with which I was ever entru&s;ted, but I have no doubt I &s;hall be able to keep it."</P>
<P>Though &s;ome circum&s;tances had be|trayed Frederick Seymour's pa&s;&s;ion to his brother, it e&s;caped the vigilant ob&s;erva|tion of Mrs. Melbourne, who indeed &s;el|dom &s;aw him but at meals. She however perceived that he was &s;ometimes ab&s;ent and thoughtful, which occa&s;ionally hap|pened in &s;pite of all his efforts, and &s;he ne|ver failed to mention what &s;he had remarked to Charlotte, only giving to ab&s;ence and thoughtfulne&s;s, the epithets of &s;ullenne&s;s and caprice; immediately after, a&s;&s;ert|ing how much &s;uch qualities were to be dreaded in a hu&s;band; a&s;&s;uring her, at the &s;ame time, that the heart of man was com|po&s;ed of &s;uch &s;lippery materials, that it could not long be retained by any plan of conduct, and that, upon the whole mar|riage
<PB N="183" REF="186">
was but another name for misfortune. Charlotte li&s;tened in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;ilence to the&s;e comfortable a&s;&s;ertions, but felt no inclination to bewail her own fate; and, notwith&s;tanding the gloomy forebodings of her aunt, thought that the evil, if &s;uch it was, of a union with the man &s;he loved, might be &s;ubmitted to with re&s;ignation. She could not be per&s;uaded, in conformity to her aunt's doctrine, that happine&s;s was as rare as the flower of the aloe, and that life was too &s;hort for its cultivation; but believed that the blo&s;&s;oms of joy were &s;cattered as liberally as the primro&s;e, or the violet, and that every traveller through the path of life might enjoy a &s;hare of their &s;weetne&s;s.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Frederick Seymour grew more and more wretched. Sometimes, with a degree of &s;ophi&s;try which pa&s;&s;ion dic|tated, he rea&s;oned him&s;elf into a per&s;ua|&s;ion that it would be more generous to un|deceive Charlotte, by making known to her the real &s;tate of his mind, than to
<PB N="184" REF="187">
impo&s;e on her credulity, by receiving her hand, when his heart was devoted to ano|ther. But a high &s;en&s;e of honor &s;oon overturned this wretched ca&s;ui&s;try. To in|flict angui&s;h on a heart which repo&s;ed on him with un&s;u&s;picious confidence, was an idea he could not long &s;upport; and he knew Julia's rectitude of mind too well, not to be convinced that &s;uch a conduct would bani&s;h him from her &s;ight for ever. He felt that every principle of ju&s;tice, and genero&s;ity, demanded the ab&s;olute &s;acri|fice of his own feelings; and he determined to marry Charlotte, to make her happine&s;s his chief object, and to confine his wretch|edne&s;s within his own bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Yet, while he formed the&s;e laudable re|&s;olutions, he contrived, with &s;trange infa|tuation, to cheri&s;h his unhappy pa&s;&s;ion. One evening Charlotte, while &s;he was making tea, reque&s;ted Julia to try &s;ome new mu&s;ic, which &s;he had received from London, on the piano forte. Julia pulled off her gloves, and placed them ha&s;tily on
<PB N="185" REF="188">
her lap: one of them dropped on the floor while &s;he was playing. Frederick Sey|mour, who was walking up and down the room, &s;eized a moment when Charlotte was talking to Mrs. Seymour, and pre|tending to be looking over &s;ome &s;ongs which lay on the piano forte, dropped one of them on the &s;pot where the glove lay, which he contrived to pick up, at the &s;ame time putting it ha&s;tily into his bo&s;om. When Julia had fini&s;hed the piece of mu&s;ic, &s;he ro&s;e from the piano forte, and mi&s;&s;ed one of her gloves: &s;he &s;tooped to look for it, and Frederick Sey|mour affected to be bu&s;y in looking for it too; but in a few moments left the room with precipitation. Julia continued a little longer her vain &s;earch, and then ha&s;tened to join the company, di&s;turbed and unea&s;y from a &s;u&s;picion of what had really hap|pened, which aro&s;e in her mind upon Sey|mour's leaving the room.</P>
<P>Seymour, when he reached his own apartment, locked the door, pulled the
<PB N="186" REF="189">
precious prize from his bo&s;om, pre&s;&s;ed it to his heart and lips ten thou&s;and times, and was guilty of the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate ex|travagancies.</P>
<P>Affection, like genius, can build its &s;tructures "on the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi|&s;ion;" and the e&s;timation which things hold in a lover's fancy, can be tried by no cal|culations of rea&s;on. The lover, like the poor Indian, who prefers gla&s;s, beads and red feathers to more u&s;eful commodities, &s;ets his affections upon a trifle, which &s;ome illu&s;ion of fancy has endeared, and which is to him more valuable than the gems of the ea&s;tern world, or the mines of the we&s;t; while rea&s;on, like the &s;age European, who &s;corns beads and feathers, in vain con|demns his folly.</P>
<P>When Seymour returned to the draw|ing-room, he was more gay, more ani|mated, more agreeable than u&s;ual; while Julia marked her re&s;entment of his con|duct in the only way in her power, by
<PB N="187" REF="190">
behaving to him with the utmo&s;t re&s;erve and coldne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, after finding &s;ome pre|tence every day for a vi&s;it to Mr. Clif|ford's, at length ventured to declare to Julia her power over his heart, and to make propo&s;als of marriage to her. Ju|lia was &s;en&s;ible that by accepting Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, &s;he would put a final end to her pre&s;ent perplexities, and perhaps ba|ni&s;h for ever, from the mind of Sey|mour, that unhappy pa&s;&s;ion which her pre&s;ence nouri&s;hed. She felt too that Charlotte's friend&s;hip claimed every &s;a|crifice in her power; and, perhaps, many will think the &s;acrifice it now required, might have been very ea&s;ily made; and that, independently of all con&s;iderations re|&s;pecting Charlotte, nothing could be more ab&s;urd than to he&s;itate in accepting &s;o advantageous an offer. It mu&s;t be ac|knowledged, that the young people of the pre&s;ent age have in general the wi&s;|dom to repre&s;s tho&s;e romantic feelings
<PB N="188" REF="191">
which u&s;ed to triumph over ambition and avarice, and have adopted the prudent maxims of maturer life. Marriage is now founded on the &s;olid ba&s;is of convenience, and love is an article commonly omitted in the treaty. But Julia, who had pa&s;&s;ed her life in retirement, was not &s;o far ad|vanced in the le&s;&s;ons of the world. Her heart, delicate, yet fervent in its affections, capable of the pure&s;t attachment, revolted at the idea of marrying where &s;he did not love; and, though &s;he was now unhappy, &s;he determined not to fly from her pre&s;ent evils to a &s;pecies of wretchedne&s;s, of all others the mo&s;t intolerable to a mind of her di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>She refu&s;ed Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> in &s;uch a manner as convinced him that he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed much of her e&s;teem.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<P>ONE morning, when Mr. Clifford and Mr. Seymour were gone on a fi&s;h|ing party, and Mrs. Seymour was engaged in writing letters, Julia, at the reque&s;t of Charlotte, went out with her on hor&s;eback, accompanied by Frederick Seymour, and Chartres. Charlotte propo&s;ed that they &s;hould take a path they had not yet ex|plored, near the borders of the lake, which led to the ruins of an old abbey, about &s;ix miles di&s;tant.</P>
<P>The country afforded a wild variety of land&s;cape, but the view was &s;ometimes ob&s;tructed by hills, and the path &s;ome|times winded under hanging rocks, piled rudely together. At length they came to a narrow road, which led for two miles along the edge of a precipice. A ridge of
<PB N="191" REF="194">
horrid cliffs frowned above, and at the bottom of this dangerous path was a deep cha&s;m, through which a noi&s;y, rapid &s;tream, rolling over a &s;tony channel, forced its way into the lake. Seymour trembled at every &s;tep, not for him&s;elf, for no life was more indifferent to him than his own; but Julia was mounted on a very &s;prightly hor&s;e, who, if &s;tartled by any object, would inevitably throw his fair rider into the gloomy aby&s;s beneath. Seymour's imagination was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by this frightful image, that he was &s;ome time before he could recover his compo|&s;ure, after they had reached the end of this formidable road, which opened to a wooded hill, near who&s;e broad ba&s;e, on a gentle declivity, the ancient abbey was feated; commanding a view of the lake, with its &s;ublime &s;cenery, and &s;haded by large groups of venerable trees.</P>
<P>Before he approached the abbey, Sey|mour in&s;i&s;ted that the ladies &s;hould not repa&s;s that formidable road on hor&s;eback;
<PB N="192" REF="195">
and they agreed to &s;end the &s;ervants and hor&s;es forward, and walk tho&s;e two miles. Chartres expatiated on the prudence of this plan, after having made a declama|tion of &s;ome length, on the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations of fear.</P>
<P>The party now came to the remains of an old wall, of con&s;iderable extent, that appeared to have &s;urrounded the build|ing. A mouldering gothic gate led to a &s;pacious area overgrown with tall gra&s;s: huge fragments of &s;tone, which had fallen from the decayed towers, were &s;cattered upon the ground, and rendered the acce&s;s difficult to the inner part of the abbey, which was on this &s;ide entirely di&s;man|tled; there being only the remains of the ruined walls, and towards the ea&s;t a large gothic window, which &s;hook at every bla&s;t, and appeared to be entirely &s;up|ported by the branches of tall elms that had grown in the in&s;ide of the building, among its &s;cattered fragments.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of the abbey, a nar|row
<PB N="193" REF="196">
&s;tone &s;tairca&s;e of one of the towers &s;till remained; which Chartres having a&s;|cended, ha&s;tened to a&s;&s;ure the ladies that the a&s;cent was extremely ea&s;y, and that when they reached the top they would find them&s;elves amply rewarded for their trouble. Charlotte, however, had not &s;uf|ficient courage for this expedition; but Julia was eager to explore every part of the ruins, and a&s;cended the &s;tairca&s;e with Chartres, notwith&s;tanding the remon|&s;trances of Seymour, who was per&s;uaded &s;he would meet with &s;ome accident, and ca&s;t an indignant look at Chartres for making the propo&s;ition. Julia found the &s;tairca&s;e much decayed: many of the &s;teps were broken; the roof was &s;o low that one could not &s;tand upright; and the light was only admitted through narrow clefts in the thick &s;tone wall. This a&s;cent opened on a turret which commanded a noble pro&s;pect, and connected the &s;hattered towers together; leading al&s;o to a narrow foot|way round the top of the chapel, the walls
<PB N="194" REF="197">
of which were &s;till entire, though the whole roof had fallen in, except one arch, carved with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite fret-work, and which, when &s;urveyed from below, &s;eemed &s;u&s;pended in air, and threatened with every breeze to cru&s;h the prying mortal who trod tho&s;e hallowed precincts. Sey|mour was obliged to remain below with Charlotte; and, when he looked up and &s;aw Julia on that dangerous height, felt all his enthu&s;ia&s;m for ruined abbies vani&s;h, and wi&s;hed this tottering pile had long ago been levelled to its foundations. Meantime, Julia gazed from the turret on the &s;ublime land&s;cape which &s;urround|ed her, and the venerable ruins, with that &s;olemn emotion &s;o grateful to a contem|plative mind. "Surely," thought &s;he, (in the fervor of an elevated &s;pirit,) "&s;urely the inhabitants of this retreat were happy!&mdash;Ah, could it be difficult to renounce a world, where an ardent heart &s;o often finds its hopes di&s;appointed, its joys embittered, and &s;eek for `Peace, the &s;acred &s;i&s;ter of
<PB N="195" REF="198">
the cell!' This va&s;t expan&s;e of water, the di&s;tant &s;ound of that falling torrent, and tho&s;e lofty mountains that arre&s;t the clouds in their progre&s;s, mu&s;t have in&s;pir|ed a frame of mind, in which the concerns of the world are con&s;idered in all their littlene&s;s, and have no power to affect our tranquillity."&mdash;Such were the reflections which pa&s;&s;ed in Julia's mind, but which only la&s;ted till &s;he was out of &s;ight of the abbey.</P>
<P>When &s;he de&s;cended from the turret, they walked over the floor of the chapel, which was now covered with loo&s;e &s;tones, half overgrown with nettles. Under the towers were a number of gloomy &s;ubter|raneous apartments with vaulted roofs, the u&s;e of which imagination was left to gue&s;s, and could only appropriate to pu|ni&s;hment and horror.</P>
<P>Charlotte, who had in vain reminded Julia &s;everal times of going home, now told her, "That &s;he hoped &s;he was not determined to take up her abode at the
<PB N="196" REF="199">
abbey; becau&s;e," added Charlotte, "though our own hou&s;e is le&s;s &s;ublime, it has the advantage of being roofed." Julia con&s;ented to go; and, as they pa&s;&s;ed through the area of the building, they heard the &s;hrill cry of the daws and rooks, and the twittering note of the &s;wallows and martins, which now occupied this habitation, de&s;erted by man.</P>
<P>When the party had pa&s;&s;ed through the old gateway, they &s;topped to look at the thick mo&s;s, and rich folds of ivy, who&s;e mantling branches over&s;pread, with the wilde&s;t luxuriance, this haunt of de&s;ola|tion. The wind had ri&s;en, and the lake was violently agitated: Julia turned her eyes from the abbey, to contemplate the &s;urges of the lake, while Charlotte, who was at a little di&s;tance behind, leaning on Seymour, &s;topped to look at a cavity in the wall, in which the &s;nail had made his ne&s;t. At that moment a gu&s;t of wind &s;hook the building, and &s;ome loo&s;e &s;tones fell from the top of the wall and rolled
<PB N="197" REF="200">
with velocity down the hill, in the di|rection where Julia was walking; whom they would inevitably have cru&s;hed in their pa&s;&s;age, if Seymour had not flown with impetuo&s;ity and &s;natched her from the impending de&s;truction. She received no other injury than a blow from a &s;mall &s;tone, that &s;truck her ancle, which was brui&s;ed by the &s;troke, and became &s;welled and painful from the &s;wiftne&s;s with which he had hurried her over the rough and hilly grounds. Supported by Charlotte and Seymour, who, in his pre&s;ent agita|tion, forgot his u&s;ual &s;cruples, and felt no di&s;po&s;ition to re&s;ign his charge to Char|tres, Julia walked on &s;lowly. Chartres was &s;ent forward to the place where the &s;er|vants and hor&s;es were waiting, with orders that one of the men &s;hould ha&s;ten home, and &s;end the carriage to that &s;pot. In the mean time, Julia walked with great diffi|culty along that narrow and dangerous road which has been before de&s;cribed, and which was two miles in length; but
<PB N="198" REF="201">
&s;he had not gone far before her ancle &s;welled &s;o much, that it could &s;upport her weight no longer, and &s;he was unable to proceed. "I will go," &s;aid Seymour, "and bring the &s;ervants to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, in conveying Mi&s;s Clifford to the carriage." "No, no," replied Charlotte, "here is no place for Julia to re&s;t on: you can &s;up|port her better than me, and I will run to the top of this ri&s;ing ground, and look for the carriage." "Mr. Seymour will go fa&s;ter than you," &s;aid Julia. "I &s;hall be back in&s;tantly," replied Charlotte; and &s;he flew with a light &s;tep up the hill, before Julia had time to frame any farther ob|jection to her going. Julia felt unea&s;y at being left alone with Seymour: &s;he was obliged to lean on his arm, and he hung over her in &s;ilence, but with a look that &s;poke his feelings more forcibly than any words he could have uttered.&mdash;She wi&s;h|ed to &s;peak, but had no power to make the effort; and appeared to feel con&s;ider|able pain. "Oh, why was I not a mo|ment
<PB N="199" REF="202">
&s;ooner," &s;aid Seymour, with much emotion, "that I might have &s;aved you tho&s;e &s;ufferings!" "They are very tri|fling," &s;aid Julia, "and you have &s;urely no cau&s;e of &s;elf-reproach on that &s;core, &s;ince you pre&s;erved my life at the ri&s;k of your own." "Oh," cried he with vehe|mence, "if you knew in how little e&s;ti|mation I hold my life, you would not think I had any merit in having hazarded it:&mdash;but the reflection that I have been the in&s;trument of your pre&s;ervation, I &s;hall ever cheri&s;h as the mo&s;t delightful that can occupy my mind!" He &s;poke, but Julia could no longer li&s;ten: overcome with pain of body, and agitation of mind, &s;he grew faint; and Charlotte, at that mo|ment, returned with Chartres: and the &s;er|vants, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted Seymour in conveying Julia to the carriage. She had walked a con&s;iderable way after the accident: her ancle was violently &s;welled, and brui&s;ed by the blow, and the pain &s;he &s;uffered, joined to more than common fatigue that
<PB N="200" REF="203">
morning, occa&s;ioned &s;ome degree of fe|ver; and &s;he was confined a few days to her room.</P>
<P>Frederick Seymour now found, that, however painful were his &s;en&s;ations in her pre&s;ence, the pang which her ab&s;ence awakened was more in&s;upportable than any other. Although &s;he con&s;tantly treat|ed him with a degree of re&s;erve, which wrung his heart with angui&s;h, it was &s;till a con&s;olation to be near her. It was &s;oothing to hear her voice, though her lips to him had lo&s;t their utterance. It was a plea&s;ure to hang upon her looks, though from him her eyes were averted. He was &s;o re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y, that he did little el&s;e but wander from one apartment to another, &s;eizing with avidity the mo&s;t tri|vial information he could procure re&s;pect|ing her, from any of the family.</P>
<P>Mr. Seymour was almo&s;t as anxious as his brother for Julia's recovery; for he &s;aw, that if her illne&s;s la&s;ted much longer, there was &s;ome rea&s;on to fear that his behaviour
<PB N="201" REF="204">
would betray the &s;ecrets of his heart, and that Charlotte's great fortune would be lo&s;t to the family. When Julia was well enough to leave her room, &s;he was led to the drawing-room by Charlotte, who placed her on the &s;ofa, and then left her to dre&s;s for dinner. A &s;hort time after, Frederick Seymour entered the room, without knowing &s;he was there. His de|light at &s;eeing her was too great to be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed: he flew to the &s;ofa, &s;eized her hand, which &s;he in vain endeavoured to withdraw, pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips, and poured forth expre&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t unbounded rapture at her recovery. "You &s;eem de|termined, Sir," &s;aid Julia, &s;natching her hand from him, "to make me wi&s;h I was &s;till confined to my room." "How cruel, how inhuman," cried he, "after &s;o many days of di&s;traction, to forbid the momen|tary expre&s;&s;ion of joy, which ru&s;hes from my &s;oul to my lips at the &s;ight of you! What have I done? how have I de&s;erved?"&mdash;
<PB N="202" REF="205">
"Oh heaven!" &s;aid Julia, leaning back on the &s;ofa, and turning very pale, "how have <HI>I</HI> de&s;erved this per&s;ecution?&mdash;Leave me, Sir, in&s;tantly; I am too weak at pre&s;ent"&mdash;She &s;topt, unable to proceed. Seymour, with a frantic look, pa&s;&s;ionately exclaimed, "Oh, wretch that I am!&mdash;you are ill&mdash;look up, angelic excellence!&mdash;what have I &s;aid? have I dared to utter a complaint? a complaint of you!&mdash;Oh, &s;ay but you forgive me! men &s;tretched upon the rack, in the extremity of their mi&s;ery, are &s;ometimes wicked enough to impeach the guiltle&s;s."&mdash;Mr. Chartres at this mo|ment entered the room, and made Julia a low bow, accompanied with all the po&s;i|tions, which were very familiar to him at pre&s;ent; for he had practi&s;ed a little dan|cing privately in his own room every day &s;ince the ball, with a laudable wi&s;h to make him&s;elf more agreeable to the ladies. He congratulated Julia upon her reco|very, informing her, at the &s;ame time, "that the whole human race were &s;ubject
<PB N="203" REF="206">
to accident, and infirmity; that &s;uch was the law of our nature, from which nei|ther the vigor of youth nor the bloom of beauty were exempt; and recommending to her earne&s;tly the &s;tudy of mathematics, which, if &s;he felt any di&s;po&s;ition to repine, would fortify her mind again&s;t the ca&s;ual|ties of life."</P>
<P>Julia, though &s;he was unable to li&s;ten to his harangue, found a relief in his pre|&s;ence, and in a few minutes grew better; While Frederick Seymour walked up and down the room in a di&s;tracted manner, frequently putting his hand to his fore|head with the action of a man in de&s;pair, and enquiring of Julia, a thou&s;and times over, if &s;he found her&s;elf better; till the appearance of the re&s;t of the family obliged him to rou&s;e his faculties, and a&s;&s;ume a look of calmne&s;s to which his heart was a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>Charlotte, during Julia's confinement to her room, had found her one morning
<PB N="204" REF="207">
looking over &s;ome papers; and &s;pied among them a Sonnet to Hope, written by Julia, of which Charlotte took a copy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Seymour now fixed the day for his departure from Mr. Clifford's &s;eat, where the uniform mode of living began to grow extremely irk&s;ome to him, who required variety of amu&s;ements, who was accu&s;tomed to a wide range of di&s;&s;ipa|tion and gaiety, and could not long be confined, without di&s;gu&s;t, to the circle of dome&s;tic enjoyments. Be&s;ides, every pur|po&s;e of his vi&s;it was now fully an&s;wered, having &s;taid a &s;ufficient time to ingratiate him&s;elf completely into Mr. Clifford's fa|vor, who conceived the highe&s;t opinion of his worth, and offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with all his influence, (which his large fortune rendered very con&s;iderable in the county where he lived,) in &s;ome electioneering bu|&s;ine&s;s. Independently, however, of this
<PB N="206" REF="209">
particular con&s;ideration, Mr. Seymour had fore&s;een that Mr. Clifford's intere&s;t might on many occa&s;ions be of u&s;e, and had therefore determined to &s;ecure it him&s;elf, tru&s;ting but little to the mediation of Fre|derick Seymour, who he knew was a novice in the arts of &s;olicitation, and was not like|ly to make any improvement in a &s;cience which he di&s;dained.</P>
<P>Mr. Seymour had &s;ecured Julia's e&s;teem by his apparent candour and benevolence, and had obtained her admiration by the brilliancy of his conver&s;ation, and his fine ta&s;te for tho&s;e elegant arts which &s;he loved with the fonde&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m. She &s;aw that he had long di&s;covered his brother's pa&s;|&s;ion for her, and felt grateful to him for the kindne&s;s and delicacy with which, on many occa&s;ions, he had relieved her em|barra&s;&s;ments, without appearing to ob|&s;erve them, and had often &s;aved Frederick Seymour from betraying his emotions, by giving a playful turn to the conver&s;ation. Julia was not aware, that Mr. Seymour's
<PB N="207" REF="210">
motive for this conduct was neither kind nor delicate; and aro&s;e merely from his apprehen&s;ion of his brother's lo&s;ing an ad|vantageous marriage, in which the intere&s;t of the whole family was concerned. But the real motives which influence men of the world, can be as little known from their actions, as the original hue of &s;ome muddy &s;ub&s;tance, which, by chemical ope|rations, has been made to a&s;&s;ume a tint of the pure&s;t colour.</P>
<P>The ta&s;k of obtaining Julia's friend|&s;hip was by no means unplea&s;ant to Mr. Seymour, who was charmed with her beau|ty, and &s;ometimes extolled it with a free|dom of admiration, which he found was extremely di&s;gu&s;ting to a mind &s;o delicate, and from which he had therefore at length the prudence to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>It was agreed that Frederick Seymour &s;hould accompany Mr. and Mrs. Seymour, and Mrs. Melbourne, to London, to &s;ettle &s;ome affairs, and to hire a villa which Mr. Seymour recommended to him, about
<PB N="208" REF="211">
thirty miles from town; where he might bring Charlotte immediately upon her marriage, which was to take place within a fortnight.</P>
<P>Mrs. Melbourne looked forward with &s;ecret &s;atisfaction to the period of her de|parture from Mr. Clifford's, for &s;he began to grow exceedingly tired for want of her u&s;ual occupations; having no &s;ervants to &s;cold when alone, and to complain of when in company; and, though in Mr. Clifford's numerous train of dome&s;tics &s;he &s;aw a fine field for action, yet &s;he was not at li|berty to di&s;play her talents for command, and could take no part in the management of the hou&s;ehold, except that of warning Charlotte again&s;t the impo&s;itions of &s;er|vants, whom &s;he always mentioned as the mo&s;t degenerate of the human race. But, unhappily for the &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e doctrines, Charlotte had already found by experience, that kindne&s;s awakened gratitude, and that confidence en&s;ured affection. The hu|man heart revolts again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, and
<PB N="209" REF="212">
is &s;oothed by gentlene&s;s, as the wave of the ocean ri&s;es in proportion to the vio|lence of the winds, and &s;inks with the breeze into mildne&s;s and &s;erenity. Mrs. Melbourne met with as little encourage|ment in the comments which &s;he occa&s;ion|ally made upon the vi&s;itors at Mr. Clif|ford's hou&s;e; where &s;he could find no per&s;on to whom &s;arca&s;m and &s;everity were agreeable, except Mrs. Seymour, and be|gan to pine for more auditors.</P>
<P>In this man&s;ion, which was the abode of benevolence and univer&s;al good-will, Mrs. Melbourne was in the &s;ituation of an unfortunate wa&s;p who has lo&s;t his &s;ting, and, though he &s;till feels a great incli|nation for mi&s;chief, has no power to gra|tify it. The frequent reading parties at Mr. Clifford's afforded that lady as little amu&s;ement as the &s;tile of conver&s;ation in this family; where the be&s;t new publica|tions were &s;ent from town, and peru&s;ed with a degree of candour, which gave her no &s;mall offence. She felt that, next to
<PB N="210" REF="213">
be&s;towing money, nothing was &s;o di&s;a|greeable as be&s;towing prai&s;e; and was almo&s;t as avaricious of commendation as of gold, to all except her daughter, to whom &s;he was ever ready to give an ac|cumulated heap of both. Mrs. Mel|bourne was, however, too prudent to di&s;|pute the merit of tho&s;e literary perform|ances, who&s;e claims to applau&s;e had been long appreciated by the voice of the pub|lic; but, where genius was not clad in the &s;trong armour of mature reputation, &s;he crept like the &s;nake to the cradle of Her|cules, and with better &s;ucce&s;s, for &s;he could dart upon an infant author with great &s;kill and ingenuity&mdash;
<Q><L>Damn with faint prai&s;e, a&s;&s;ent with civil leer,</L>
<L>And, without &s;neering, teach the re&s;t to &s;neer.</L></Q></P>
<P>But what, more than either her de&s;ire of power, or her fondne&s;s of &s;atire, impelled Mrs. Melbourne to ha&s;ten her departure, was, that &s;he had caught a cold, and began to apprehend that the air of the north was too &s;harp for her con&s;titution. She had a
<PB N="211" REF="214">
more than common horror at the thoughts of dying, and, whenever that terrific idea obtruded it&s;elf, ha&s;tened to bani&s;h it from her affrighted mind by every effort in her power; and, when &s;he failed of &s;ucce&s;s, endeavoured to find comfort in recollect|ing all the in&s;tances of longevity &s;he had ever heard, and which were carefully trea|&s;ured in her memory. She found &s;ome refuge for her fears in &s;uch of her ac|quaintances as were older, and more in|firm than her&s;elf; and hoped, by an unre|mitting care of her own per&s;on, to extend life to its utmo&s;t limits: but, when at|tacked by the &s;lighte&s;t malady, &s;he in|&s;tantly fancied that &s;he perceived the ap|proaches of the gri&s;ly phantom, couched under the head-ach, or advancing in the rear of a cold, and armed her&s;elf for de|fence with a formidable force of medicine. Nor was there a di&s;order to which the human frame is liable, of which &s;he had not felt, at &s;ome period or other, the mo&s;t indubitable &s;ymptoms. Her phy&s;ician,
<PB N="212" REF="215">
who was a man of a very liberal mind, &s;ometimes rea&s;oned, and &s;ometimes laughed at her weakne&s;s; but plea&s;antry and rea&s;on were both admini&s;tered in vain to her di&s;tempered imagination, which pre|ferred a pre&s;cription to argument, and a cordial drug to the gaye&s;t effu&s;ions of wit.</P>
<P>The day of Mr. Seymour's departure arrived, and Mr. Clifford propo&s;ed, with his daughter and niece, to accompany the travellers twenty miles on their journey. The whole family accordingly &s;et out to|gether. Julia was at &s;ome pains to avoid going in the &s;ame carriage with Frede|rick Seymour; and, at the inn where the party &s;topped to breakfa&s;t before they &s;e|parated, &s;he was careful to place her&s;elf at a di&s;tance from him. He did not venture to approach her, but appeared thoughtful and melancholy.</P>
<P>When the carriages were ready, Char|lotte took hold of Mrs. Seymour's arm, and they went out together. Frederick
<PB N="213" REF="216">
Seymour was near the door, and Julia kept back, pretending to look at &s;ome|thing from the window, till &s;he thought he was gone: but he &s;uffered the other gentlemen to pa&s;s him, and then, after de|&s;iring aloud to have the honour of hand|ing her down &s;tairs, he &s;topt her for a moment, and &s;aid, in the greate&s;t agita|tion, "Mu&s;t I, then, leave you under the cruel impre&s;&s;ion of having entirely for|feited your e&s;teem." "If <HI>that,</HI> Sir, was of any value to you&mdash;" "<HI>If,</HI>" interrupted he, with vehemence, "it was of any va|lue to me! What a cruel &s;urmi&s;e!&mdash;Ah, when that e&s;teem is altogether lo&s;t, the link by which I hold my exi&s;tence will be broken. In pity to the wretchedne&s;s of my heart, &s;ay that you will forgive the pa&s;t." "I will remember it no more."</P>
<P>They now reached the door of the inn, and Frederick Seymour, in the perturba|tion of his mind, almo&s;t forgot to bid Charlotte farewel; who, however, attri|buted
<PB N="214" REF="217">
his apparent chagrin to the thoughts of his &s;eparation from her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Chartres had di&s;played &s;o much unaffected &s;orrow at the pro&s;pect of leav|ing Mr. Clifford's, that he received an in|vitation from that gentleman to remain with him till his return to town. This young man had one peculiarity in which he re&s;embled Mr. Nathaniel Transfer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Zeluco.</NOTE>; (a per&s;onage who&s;e acquaintance every reader of ta&s;te is, no doubt, proud to ac|knowledge). Mr. Chartres only liked tho&s;e things to which he had been long <HI>accu&s;tomed.</HI> He had looked forward to his introduction at Mr. Clifford's with a de|gree of apprehen&s;ion which &s;ometimes deprived him of appetite, and &s;ometimes of re&s;t; but, being now <HI>accu&s;tomed</HI> to the family, he de&s;ired no happine&s;s beyond its &s;ociety, and was in tran&s;ports of joy when he found that happine&s;s would be pro|longed; remarking, in their way home, "That plea&s;ure, after unea&s;ine&s;s, was par|ticularly
<PB N="215" REF="218">
grateful to the heart of man; and, in my opinion," added he, "the country, to tho&s;e who have a competent knowledge of Greek, Latin, and experi|mental philo&s;ophy, is far preferable to a town." "Well, Mr. Chartres," &s;aid Charlotte, "I can entertain my&s;elf in the country without being obliged to any of your auxiliaries." But a man who has lei|&s;ure," rejoined Chartres, "&s;hould not live merely for his own entertainment, but have recour&s;e to &s;cience, for the benefit of po&s;terity." Charlotte a&s;ked him, "if he intended, in kindne&s;s to po&s;terity, to adopt tho&s;e &s;tudies when he came back from the Ea&s;t?" "Certainly," an&s;wered Char|tres; "and although I con&s;ider riches as an ignoble pur&s;uit, my love of experimen|tal philo&s;ophy will prompt me to acquire wealth, in the hopes of adding &s;omething to the &s;tock of u&s;eful learning at my re|turn to my native country."</P>
<P>Mr. Clifford and his party, in their way home, came to the foot of a very &s;teep
<PB N="216" REF="219">
hill, and Charlotte propo&s;ed that they &s;hould alight, and walk up the hill. In their way, they pa&s;&s;ed a &s;mall cottage, or rather hut, where they &s;aw a lovely young woman, who appeared about eighteen years of age, &s;itting at the door, and cry|ing bitterly: two little girls were crying with her. "What is the matter?" &s;aid Charlotte: one of the children an&s;wered, "that <HI>&s;he</HI> cried becau&s;e Hannah cried." "Have you met with any misfortune?" &s;aid Charlotte. "My poor dog, Madam," an&s;wered the young woman, &s;obbing, "I have lo&s;t him." "Is that all?" rejoined Charlotte, "you can get another dog." "But he will not have been Harry's dog," replied the young woman; who then, in a voice often choaked by tears, told Char|lotte her &s;tory. She had been courted by a young pea&s;ant, and the day was fixed for their wedding. Her father and mother were both dead; but her brother, with whom &s;he lived, had bought her a new gown, and a &s;et of red ribbands for her
<PB N="217" REF="220">
marriage; when her lover returning home from his work one &s;tormy night, acro&s;s a rapid &s;tream, the boat over&s;et, and the young man was drowned. His dog, Rover, had jumped into the water, dragged his ma&s;ter on &s;hore, and then lay down near the dead body moaning mo&s;t piteou&s;ly. Hannah, and her brother, who began to fear, from Harry's long &s;tay, that &s;ome evil had befallen him, went out to look for him, and found his corp&s;e on the bank of the &s;tream, and Rover &s;tretched be&s;ide it. Poor Hannah, at the &s;ight of her dead lover, wi&s;hed to die too; but her brother intreated her to be comforted, and live for the &s;ake of her young brothers and &s;i&s;ters. It was with difficulty that Han|nah could be torn from her lover's corp&s;e, and Rover &s;eemed as unwilling to leave it as her&s;elf. "Rover," &s;he &s;aid, "if he had been a chri&s;tian, could not have loved his ma&s;ter better, or took his lo&s;s more to heart; and ever &s;ince that time, it had been a &s;ort of comfort to her to have the
<PB N="218" REF="221">
poor dog always with her. Many a time," &s;he &s;aid, "&s;he had talked to him of his ma&s;ter, and often, when they had not vic|tuals enough for them&s;elves and Rover too, &s;he had gone without a mor&s;el, to give it to him; for Rover eat as much as any of the children; and now he had gone and lo&s;t him&s;elf in the wood." Julia a&s;ked her "if it was not a plea&s;ure to take care of tho&s;e pretty children, and &s;ee them thrive." She &s;aid "Yes, &s;he would try and live as long as &s;he could, for their &s;akes, but &s;he knew her heart would break at la&s;t." A countryman now appeared at a di&s;tance, calling out, "Hannah, Hannah!" He was her brother, with Rover in his arms. Hannah flew to the dog, ki&s;&s;ed him a thou&s;and times, and a&s;ked him, how he could leave her? Rover wagged his tail heartily, and &s;eemed to partake in the joy of their meeting. There were many marks of extreme poverty di&s;cernible in the&s;e poor people, and their habitation, although they made no complaint. But
<PB N="219" REF="222">
it would &s;eem that the precious e&s;&s;ence of content can be more ea&s;ily extracted from the &s;imple materials of the poor, than from the various preparations of the rich. Its pure and fine &s;pirit ri&s;es from a few plain ingredients, brighter and clearer than from that magical cup of di&s;&s;ipation, where the powerful, and the wealthy, with length|ened incantations, pour their co&s;tly infu|&s;ions&mdash;"double, double, toil and trou|ble!"</P>
<P>Mr. Clifford a&s;ked Peter, "How he could get enough by his work to maintain &s;o large a family?" Peter &s;aid, "To be &s;ure it was not ea&s;y, but they were good children, and moreover, he had promi&s;ed his father, when he lay a dying, to take care of them; but &s;ometimes he could get no work, and then it went a little hard with them to be &s;ure." Mr. Clifford, touched by the &s;imple goodne&s;s of this young pea&s;ant, generou&s;ly offered to give him a cottage in his own neighbourhood and to employ him in working in his
<PB N="220" REF="223">
grounds. The propo&s;al was accepted with tran&s;port; and, the very next day, Peter, accompanied by Hannah, the children, and Rover, &s;et out for his new habitation.</P>
<P>Julia and Charlotte employed them|&s;elves in making camlet-gowns and round caps for the children, who were delighted with their new finery; while poor Hannah cried, and &s;aid, "&s;he never thought to be &s;o happy again; and &s;he wi&s;hed Harry had but lived to &s;ee the little ones in their new gowns, for he always loved the children." The happine&s;s of this poor family was amply &s;hared by their kind benefactors. Charlotte was &s;o bu&s;y in furni&s;hing their cottage, and providing for their wants, that &s;he almo&s;t forgot the ab&s;ence of her lover; and Julia a&s;&s;i&s;ted, with delighted a&s;&s;iduity, in the&s;e offices of charity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>FREDERICK Seymour, in his letters to Charlotte, informed her that bu&s;i|ne&s;s would detain him in town longer than he expected; and the day he fixed for his return was only that preceding the day of his marriage. Afraid of tru&s;ting his feel|ings in &s;o critical a &s;ituation, he deter|mined to delay his return as long as it was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The day before that on which Seymour was expected, Mr. Clifford was invited to a gentleman's hou&s;e in the neighbour|hood, where an old friend of his was ju&s;t arrived from the Ea&s;t Indies, and was to pa&s;s one night in his way to the habi|tation of his parents. Mr. Clifford could not deny him&s;elf the &s;atisfaction of pre|&s;enting his daughter to his friend; and
<PB N="222" REF="225">
Charlotte, though her mind was too much occupied by the approaching change in her &s;ituation, to leave her any inclination for company, determined to go, becau&s;e her father wi&s;hed it.</P>
<P>Julia, agitated and oppre&s;&s;ed, de&s;ired no|thing &s;o much as a day of &s;olitude, in which &s;he might fortify her mind by re|flection, form plans for her future conduct, &s;ettle every account with her own heart, and prepare to meet Frederick Seymour with compo&s;ure, and even chearfulne&s;s. She therefore complained of being &s;lightly indi&s;po&s;ed, and reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to re|main at home, which was reluctantly granted. Mr. Chartres accompanied Mr. Clifford and Charlotte, and Julia &s;aw them depart with plea&s;ure, &s;oothed with the pro&s;pect of one day of tranquillity. She walked to her favourite nook, that over|hung the lake, and contemplated the ma|je&s;ty of nature; pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours in me|ditation, and returned home with a mind
<PB N="223" REF="226">
elevated above the &s;adne&s;s and depre&s;&s;ion with which &s;he had &s;et out.</P>
<P>After dinner &s;he vi&s;ited &s;ome of the cot|tagers. It was a bright afternoon in Octo|ber, and &s;he loitered in her way home to admire the rich variety of tints which were ca&s;t on the &s;urrounding &s;cenery; &s;he then &s;aw the &s;etting &s;un &s;inking &s;lowly behind a hill at &s;ome di&s;tance, from which a va|pour a&s;cended that was tinged, as it aro&s;e, by the glowing rays, and gave the broad &s;ummit of the hill the appearance of a &s;tream of floating flame.</P>
<P>Julia had never before ob&s;erved this ef|fect of the &s;etting &s;un, which &s;he gazed at till the bright vi&s;ion gradually di&s;&s;olved, and "Twilight grey, had in her &s;ober liv'ry all things clad." To a lover of nature, the la&s;t days of autumn are peculiarly intere&s;t|ing. We take leave of the fading beauties of the &s;ea&s;on with a melancholy emotion, &s;ome|what &s;imilar to that which we feel in bidding farewell to a lively and agreeable companion, who&s;e pre&s;ence has diffu&s;ed gladne&s;s, who&s;e
<PB N="224" REF="227">
&s;mile has been the &s;ignal of plea&s;ure, and whom we are uncertain of beholding again: for, though the period of his return is fixed, <HI>who,</HI> amid&s;t the ca&s;ualties of life, can be &s;ecure, that, in the interval of ab&s;ence, <HI>his</HI> eye &s;hall not be clo&s;ed in darkne&s;s, and <HI>his</HI> heart have lo&s;t the &s;en&s;ation of de|light?</P>
<P>When Julia returned to the hou&s;e, &s;he found one of the &s;ervants was &s;ent back by Charlotte with a note, inform|ing her, that her father had been pre|vailed on to remain that night. Julia was thankful for this reprieve. She congratu|lated her&s;elf on the comfort of one even|ing of undi&s;turbed calmne&s;s, brought a volume of each of her favourite poets, Pope and Thom&s;on, from the library, and ordered tea, to which &s;he thought that &s;tillne&s;s and poetry gave a more agreeable flavor than u&s;ual, when the door was &s;ud|denly opened by Frederick Seymour. At his appearance, &s;he &s;tarted from her &s;eat; but, immediately recollecting herfelf, &s;poke
<PB N="225" REF="228">
to him with all the compo&s;ure &s;he could a&s;&s;ume. "Mr. Seymour," &s;aid &s;he, "you were &s;o little expected to-night, that my uncle and Charlotte are gone to pay a vi|&s;it." "I thought," he an&s;wered, with great emotion, "that it would not have been in my power to return to-night, but, as my bu&s;ine&s;s was fini&s;hed, I had little inclination to remain ab&s;ent till to-mor|row." He appeared in much agitation. Julia, on her part, determined to &s;upport the trial of the evening with firmne&s;s and dignity, talked on &s;ubjects of indifference. Afraid of any interval of &s;ilence, &s;he made an effort, the mo&s;t painful, to keep up a con|ver&s;ation, almo&s;t intirely un&s;upported on the part of Seymour; and, without &s;eem|ing to ob&s;erve his confu&s;ion, continued &s;peaking, till at length he recovered &s;ome degree of compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>When other topics were exhau&s;ted, Ju|lia, di&s;turbed and unhappy, almo&s;t unable to &s;peak, and yet terrified to remain &s;ilent, had recour&s;e, in her perplexities, to the
<PB N="226" REF="229">
&s;etting &s;un, who&s;e uncommon appearance that evening &s;he de&s;cribed; though, in the pre&s;ent perturbation of her thoughts, it had lo&s;t all power of affecting her imagi|nation: &s;he painted the &s;cene with little energy, and the picture &s;eemed to intere&s;t Seymour &s;till le&s;s than her&s;elf. She then talked of the country, which was, at pre|&s;ent, as indifferent to her as the &s;etting &s;un; and obliged Seymour to repeat de|&s;criptions of the &s;ublime &s;cenes of Switzer|land, which he had often given her before with animation and &s;pirit, and which he now gave with the utmo&s;t coldne&s;s and difficulty. Thence &s;he took refuge in Italy, and made him lead her through half Europe, glad to be tran&s;ported, as far as po&s;&s;ible from her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Tea was protracted as long as &s;he could&mdash;it was having &s;omething to do. When that re&s;ource failed, &s;he took up her work, affected to be very bu&s;y, and a&s;ked him to read &s;ome of Pope's moral epi&s;tles, which lay upon the table. He read very
<PB N="227" REF="230">
ill, and with &s;uch ab&s;ence of mind, that, when Julia, at the end of an epi&s;tle, men|tioned the pa&s;&s;ages which particularly plea&s;ed her, he an&s;wered in &s;uch a manner as &s;hewed that he &s;carcely recollected the &s;ubject. At length the de&s;cription of Ti|mon's villa put him in mind of the contra&s;t between that and the beautiful villa he had ju&s;t taken; and he laid down the book, to give Julia an account of the di&s;po&s;ition of the grounds, with which &s;he appeared ex|tremely plea&s;ed. "And when will you vi&s;it it?" &s;aid Seymour, in a tone of emo|tion. "Probably next &s;ummer," &s;he an|&s;wered. "Not till next &s;ummer!" rejoined Seymour. "You will, I believe, be &s;et|tled in town," &s;aid Julia, "before my uncle leaves this place; if not, we &s;hall certainly come in &s;earch of Charlotte." "Charlotte!" he repeated&mdash;"&s;he is very amiable." "She is indeed," &s;aid Julia, with earne&s;tne&s;s, "every thing the heart can wi&s;h in a do|me&s;tic companion." She then gave Sey|mour
<PB N="228" REF="231">
the hi&s;tory of the poor pea&s;ant's fa|mily, and de&s;cribed, with enthu&s;ia&s;m, Charlotte's active benevolence. "Oh! way," &s;aid Seymour, with an emotion he &s;eemed wholly unable to controul, "why, when Charlotte po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o many virtues, &s;hould there exi&s;t <HI>one,</HI> to whom Charlotte&mdash;Oh Julia! your penetration has di&s;cover|ed&mdash;" She immediately ro&s;e to leave the room. "Oh &s;tay but one moment," he eagerly cried, "in compa&s;&s;ion, Ma|dam, &s;tay but while I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you, that you have nothing more to fear from my complaints&mdash;that they &s;hall never again be uttered in your pre&s;ence, that they &s;hall never again di&s;turb your felicity.&mdash;Oh may every felicity attend you!&mdash;may <HI>you</HI> be happy, when the grave &s;hall have covered my de&s;pair, and my heart &s;hall retain no longer tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations, which are interwoven with my exi&s;tence." Julia walking towards the door as fa&s;t as &s;he could, he came up to her: "Say but
<PB N="229" REF="232">
you forgive me&mdash;Oh go not, Madam, if you wi&s;h me to pre&s;erve life or rea&s;on, go not from me in di&s;plea&s;ure!" She turned back: her eyes were filled with tears. "I return, Sir," &s;he &s;aid, in a faltering voice, "only to tell you, that another &s;cene like this, will force me to for&s;ake the a&s;ylum I have found beneath my uncle's roof, and conceal my&s;elf where I may never more be heard of." "Oh do not terrify me with &s;uch images; in compa&s;&s;ion forgive the rav|ings of madne&s;s, and never &s;hall they again offend you." The angui&s;h of his looks, and the extreme perturbation of his voice and manner affected her. "I will forget what is pa&s;t," &s;he faintly pro|nounced. He &s;eized her hand, and pre&s;&s;|ed it to his heart. She ha&s;tened out of the room: he held the door open, and looked after her, till &s;he had cro&s;&s;ed the &s;aloon, and was out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>When &s;he had &s;ufficiently recovered
<PB N="230" REF="233">
her&s;elf, &s;he rung the bell for her maid, told her &s;he was not very well, and de|&s;ired, that one of the &s;ervants would beg of Mr. Seymour to order &s;upper for him|&s;elf at what hour he cho&s;e. Seymour pa&s;&s;ed the evening in an agitation of mind, which gave him rea&s;on to repent of the weakne&s;s that had led him to change his re&s;olution not to return till the next day.</P>
<P>Julia, for a &s;hort time, indulged that &s;adne&s;s excited by the painful &s;cene which had pa&s;t. She then tried to read, but could not command her attention, and walked to a window, where &s;he &s;aw, above &s;ome dark rocks, that overhung the lake in the &s;hape of ruins, the &s;ky tinged with a variety of colours, which were re|flected on the &s;urface of the water. The northern lights fla&s;hed over the hemi|&s;phere, and their motion was &s;tronger than u&s;ual. Julia gazed a con&s;iderable
<PB N="231" REF="234">
time on tho&s;e beautiful appearances of nature, and in &s;uch contemplation, which had ever a mo&s;t powerful effect on her mind, regained &s;ome compo&s;ure before &s;he retired to re&s;t.</P>

<P>THE following morning Julia break|fa&s;ted in her own apartment, and Mr. Clifford and Charlotte returned &s;oon after. Through the cour&s;e of this day, Julia avoided, as much as was in her power, the &s;ight of Seymour, for &s;he trem|bled le&s;t any di&s;covery of his feelings &s;hould yet prevent the marriage, and earne&s;t|ly wi&s;hed for the arrival of the &s;ucceeding day, which would for ever unite him to another, and, by bani&s;hing all &s;u&s;pence and doubt, lead him to exert the con|&s;tancy and re&s;olution of his &s;pirit. And &s;he hoped, that when his &s;ituation was ir|revocable, the certainty of its being &s;o would prove a great and powerful anti|dote again&s;t the indulgence of unavailing regrets.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="236">
Mr. Clifford was in high &s;pirits, and Chartres di&s;played, though &s;omewhat in a bungling manner, his &s;ympathy in the fe|licity of his friends. The whole hou&s;e was a &s;cene of general chearfulne&s;s; the &s;ervants were bu&s;y in adju&s;ting their &s;ilver favours, and making preparations for the marriage day; and, as Charlotte was be|loved by every individual in the family, all were &s;olicitous and proud to di&s;play their joy and exultation.</P>
<P>Mean while, Seymour pa&s;&s;ed the day in the mo&s;t violent &s;truggles of pa&s;&s;ion, the mo&s;t cruel conflict between honour and inclination. But, when we attempt to de|&s;cribe the &s;truggles of pa&s;&s;ion, how in|adequate is language to its purpo&s;e!&mdash;Where are the words that &s;hall convey a ju&s;t idea of the pangs of wounded affec|tion?&mdash;Alas! the heart can feel more &s;trongly than the imagination can paint; and, even while we heave the &s;igh of commi&s;eration for the &s;ufferer, we do not reflect on the full force of his &s;uffer|ings.
<PB N="234" REF="237">
We cannot exactly judge of the bit|terne&s;s of tho&s;e moments when the over|whelmed &s;pirit flies to &s;olitude to give vent to its &s;tifled agonies; when &s;orrow ab&s;orbs every faculty of the &s;oul; when it rejects every thought of con&s;olation, and finds a gloomy indulgence in nouri&s;hing its own wretchedne&s;s! Yet Seymour was obliged to appear not merely con|tented, but animated and happy. Oh, &s;urely the moment in which mi&s;ery is mo&s;t intolerable to the human mind, is, when we are condemned to conceal its de&s;pondency under the ma&s;k of joy! to wear a look of gladne&s;s, while our &s;ouls are bleeding with that wound which gives a mortal &s;tab to all our future peace! It is then that the angui&s;h, which has been for a moment repul&s;ed to make room for other ideas, ru&s;hes with redoubled force upon the &s;ickening heart, and oppre&s;&s;es it with a &s;pecies of torment little &s;hort of madne&s;s. The effu&s;ions of gaiety, which
<PB N="235" REF="238">
are &s;o exhilarating to a mind at ea&s;e, come to an aching brea&s;t as a ray of the &s;un falls upon ice, too deep to be penetrated by its influence.</P>
<P>Charlotte and Julia, the next morning, went in one carriage, and Mr. Clifford, Seymour, and Chartres, in another, to the church of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, where the marriage ceremony was performed. They returned, accompanied by the clergyman, to break|fa&s;t, after which, the new-married pair were to &s;et out for the country &s;eat that was prepared for their reception and where they were to pa&s;s &s;ome weeks. When the car|riages which were to convey the married couple, and their attendants, were ready, Charlotte, after embracing Julia, and taking leave of Chartres, felt her heart too full at this awful &s;eparation from her fa|ther, to bid him farewell before a number of witne&s;&s;es: &s;he could not tru&s;t her voice, but, taking his hand, led him to another room. The clergyman and Chartres &s;auntered, mean time, to the door of the
<PB N="236" REF="239">
&s;aloon, to examine the equipage in wait|ing; and Seymour and Julia were left to|gether. "Will you &s;uffer me," he &s;aid, "Mi&s;s Clifford, before I go, to expre&s;s the regret&mdash;the contrition I feel, for all the unea&s;ine&s;s my conduct mu&s;t have given you? May I implore you to bani&s;h from your remembrance, that per&s;ecution for which I feel the true&s;t penitence; and to believe that my re&s;pect, my admiration of your virtues&mdash;" "Talk no more, Sir, of the pa&s;t," &s;he replied: then, ri&s;ing from her &s;eat, &s;he added, "I mu&s;t go in &s;earch of Charlotte." "Will you not," rejoined Seymour, "greatly as I have offended, be&s;tow one generous wi&s;h for my peace at parting?" "I &s;incerely wi&s;h, Sir, your felicity, and &s;urely no mortal has a fairer pro&s;pect of happine&s;s than your&s;elf." "Of happine&s;s!" he exclaimed, and, after a moment's pau&s;e, added, "May <HI>you,</HI> Ma|dam, be happy as your virtues de&s;erve, happy as <HI>I</HI> wi&s;h you!&mdash;To hear of your felicity will be the only"&mdash;then checking
<PB N="237" REF="240">
him&s;elf, he &s;aid, "but I will not pre&s;ume to detain you." Julia was ha&s;tening out of the room, when Mr. Clifford and Char|lotte returned: the two friends again em|braced each other in &s;ilence. Mr. Clif|ford led his daughter to the carriage, Sey|mour followed, and in a few minutes Charlotte was out of &s;ight of her paternal dwelling.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifford fea&s;ted his tenants liberal|ly; who drank with much vociferation to the happine&s;s of their fair mi&s;tre&s;s; and the day was pa&s;&s;ed in fe&s;tivity. Chartres joined heartily in the general mirth, and, when his &s;pirits were elevated by repeated toa&s;ts to Charlotte's felicity, &s;ung his be&s;t &s;ongs for the entertainment of the company. He had a very powerful voice, and &s;ung as he danced, with all his &s;trength and might, and as if he thought the fir&s;t excellence of &s;inging was to be loud.</P>
<P>Julia, in an adjoining apartment, thank|fully li&s;tened to this noi&s;y merriment, which, by engaging Mr. Clifford's atten|tion,
<PB N="238" REF="241">
&s;pared her the ta&s;k of &s;truggling with a con&s;cious &s;adne&s;s that weighed upon her heart, and which, though &s;he determined to &s;ubdue it, refu&s;ed to be in&s;tantly repul&s;ed by any effort of her rea&s;on. Chartres alarmed her not a little, by enquiring of Mr. Clifford, "what could be the rea&s;on that Mr. Seymour turned as pale as death when he pre&s;ented his bride with the wed|ding-ring?" Mr. Clifford replied, "That it was not uncommon to be agitated on &s;o &s;olemn an occa&s;ion." To this Chartres rejoined, "That Mr. Seymour's counte|nance that morning, had convinced him, that matrimony was a very &s;olemn affair indeed."</P>

<P>JULIA's perplexities were now over. She felt that &s;he ought to be happy, and endeavoured to per&s;uade her&s;elf that &s;he was &s;o. Neverthele&s;s, the &s;cenes which had pa&s;&s;ed with Seymour, had left her mind in a &s;tate of di&s;turbance and de|pre&s;&s;ion, which &s;he could not immediately conquer, but which &s;he determined not to indulge.</P>
<P>By her affectionate attention, &s;he tried to &s;upply to Mr. Clifford the lo&s;s of his daughter; made every effort to be cheer|ful; and when, in &s;pite of her efforts, her cheerfulne&s;s for&s;ook her, &s;he imputed it to an anxious &s;olicitude which hung upon her mind re&s;pecting Charlotte's happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="243">
It was fortunate that Julia had at this time but little lei&s;ure for &s;olitude, or reflection, Mr. Clifford's hou&s;e being crouded with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vi&s;itors, who came to congratulate him on his daugh|ter's marriage. We mu&s;t add, much to the honour of Charlotte, that their congratu|lations were not made in oppo&s;ition to their feelings: and what higher eulogium can we be&s;tow on Charlotte's merit, than to declare that her pro&s;perity excited no envy? Her uniform &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;i|tion, her kind and una&s;&s;uming manners, and con&s;tant attention to promote the &s;a|tisfaction of others, had endeared her to all by whom &s;he was known; and even tho&s;e who had the greate&s;t in&s;en&s;ibility of tem|per, agreed, that if &s;ome one in the world mu&s;t be more fortunate, more happy than them&s;elves, Charlotte was the very per&s;on who be&s;t de&s;erved that di&s;tingui&s;hed lot.</P>
<P>Among Mr. Clifford's vi&s;itors was Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, who was dre&s;&s;ed in deep mourn|ing, and appeared in great dejection of

&s;pirits. In the cour&s;e of a walk, which Mr. Clifford propo&s;ed, Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> took an opportunity of telling Julia, that he had lately lo&s;t his only brother. "The circum&s;tances of his death," &s;aid he, "are &s;uch as I am unable to relate, but they were particularly affecting, and, if you will give me permi&s;&s;ion, I will &s;end you a packet which contains the account, and which, I believe, will intere&s;t you."

<SALUTE>My dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>To communicate afflicting intelli|gence is &s;o painful a ta&s;k, that I am only prompted to undertake it by the con&s;ideration that it is a duty which friend&s;hip on this occa&s;ion demands. I mu&s;t not leave you to be informed by
<PB N="242" REF="245">
public report of our mutual misfortune. Your gallant brother, my dear friend, fell in the action of ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>As we marched to the attack, he was uncommonly gay. Having received a &s;e|vere wound in the arm, he refu&s;ed to leave the ranks, and continued to encourage the &s;oldiers, till a &s;econd &s;hot brought him to the ground; and even then he would not permit any of the men to leave the action to carry him off. The &s;urgeon dre&s;&s;ed his wounds on the &s;pot where he fell. After we had driven the enemy from the in|trenchments, he was borne to a hut by four grenadiers. "Albeit unu&s;ed to the melting mood," their cheeks were bathed in tears. As they pa&s;&s;ed one &s;oldier who lay wounded on the ground, the poor fel|low, &s;eeing his officer, rai&s;ed his languid head, and &s;aid, "God Almighty recover, and ble&s;s your honour!" My friend in|&s;i&s;ted on their &s;topping: he took the &s;ol|dier by the hand, &s;aying, "I thank you, my brave lad; be of good cheer, I'll &s;end
<PB N="243" REF="246">
your friends for you directly." The &s;oldier repeated, "God Almighty ble&s;s you!" and expired.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the night with your brother; and it was a mo&s;t affecting night. He talked with much emotion of the angui&s;h you would feel. He de&s;ired his effects might be given to certain officers whom he named: his ring to one; watch to an|other, &amp;c. hoping they would keep them as remembrances of a departed comrade and friend. He then took from his bo|&s;om the profile of a young lady, whom I had often heard him mention with rapture. "Send this profile," &s;aid he, "by the fir&s;t proper opportunity, to my beloved Sophia: let her know that I parted with this dear remembrance but in death!&mdash;Alas! how will &s;he &s;u&s;tain this affliction?&mdash;Heaven &s;upport and comfort her!&mdash;Oh my Sophia! &s;hall we meet no more?"</P>
<P>His ruling pa&s;&s;ion, a thir&s;t for military fame, did not for&s;ake him even in the&s;e la&s;t moments; and I am convinced that he
<PB N="244" REF="247">
regretted his approaching di&s;&s;olution mo&s;t on account of its cutting him &s;hort in the career of glory. To me he made a pre|&s;ent of his &s;word. "May it be your pro|tector in the hour of danger," &s;aid he, laying his cold hand on mine&mdash;"and lead you to a degree of di&s;tinction, to which I once hoped it would have conducted me. I regret not the lo&s;s of life; but, my dear Edward, I do regret, like Douglas, "to be cut off glory's cour&s;e"&mdash;"which," added he, with a dying voice, "never mortal was &s;o fond to run!" Judge, my dear friend, how I was affected&mdash;how I am affected!&mdash;I cannot continue.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The intelligence you re|ceived by the me&s;&s;enger who brought your letter to me, conveying the tidings of Captain F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s death, and enclo&s;ing my friend Sophia Herbert's profile, was, alas! too true. When your me&s;&s;enger left this place, &s;he lay in the delirium of a fever. You tell me, in your &s;econd let|ter, that a better principle than curio&s;ity leads you to enquire into the hi&s;tory of this unfortunate attachment. To gratify this reque&s;t will be a relief to my afflicted mind.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="249">
Mr. Herbert had an e&s;tate in the neighbourhood of Norfolk, in Virginia, and his hou&s;e was within half a mile of the town. This gentleman had two &s;ons and a daughter. The elde&s;t &s;on, who was per&s;onally known to General Wa&s;hington, had been appointed one of his aid-du|camps, and was with the main army: the younger &s;on remained with his father, and was walking with him, and his &s;i&s;ter, on the lawn before their hou&s;e, when the cry of arms was heard. The young man ha&s;tily tore him&s;elf from his &s;i&s;ter, flew to his arms, and ru&s;hed towards the town: his father prepared to follow. Surpri&s;e and horror had, for a few moments, deprived Sophia of the power of &s;peech or mo|tion; but &s;he now clung round her father's neck, and implored him not to de&s;ert her. He di&s;engaged him&s;elf from her hold, intreated her to be calm, and go in&s;tantly to the hou&s;e; told her he would &s;oon re|turn, and recommended her to the care of Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="250">
Sophia looked after him in &s;ilent agony, and, when he was out of &s;ight, &s;till continued &s;tanding in the &s;ame at|titude, unable to &s;hed a tear. At length &s;he &s;aw a &s;oldier running pa&s;t the end of the lawn, and called to him to &s;top. The &s;oldier pau&s;ed a moment&mdash;he was one of her father's tenants. "Ah, Madam," he exclaimed, "all is over; our troops have given way, and the Eng|li&s;h have &s;et fire to the town; I have no time"&mdash;"Stop," &s;he eagerly cried, with horror in her looks, "Have you &s;een my father, and brother?" "Ah, Madam, you will never &s;ee your brother more; I &s;erved in his company, and &s;aw him fall, and I fear&mdash;." Sophia waited not for more, &s;he gave a piercing &s;hriek, and flew with precipitation towards the town; but, as &s;he approached, the &s;ight of the &s;preading flames, the tumultuous cries of the women, and the cla&s;h of arms, made her &s;hrink back involuntarily. She had, however, gone too far to retreat, and was
<PB N="248" REF="251">
mingled with a crowd of helple&s;s women and children, who were flying in de&s;pera|tion, they knew not whither; &s;ome ha&s;ten|ing from the &s;cene of de&s;olation, others returning, with di&s;tracted countenances, to &s;ave an aged parent or a helple&s;s infant from the fury of the flames. Carele&s;s of danger, and almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible of her &s;ituation, So|phia &s;till pre&s;&s;ed forward, till &s;he was &s;top|ped by a bleeding corp&s;e which oppo&s;ed her pa&s;&s;age; when ca&s;ting her eyes down, &s;he perceived the features of her brother, disfi|gured by death, and covered with blood. She cla&s;ped her hands&mdash;her lips moved, but they had lo&s;t the power of utterance: her whole frame trembled, and &s;he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on her brother's corp&s;e.</P>
<P>When &s;he recovered, &s;he found her|&s;elf &s;upported by an Engli&s;h officer, who gazed on her with a look of earne&s;t &s;olici|tude. She appeared for &s;ome minutes uncon&s;cious of all that had pa&s;&s;ed; but, when her recollection returned, and &s;he perceived the dead body of her
<PB N="249" REF="252">
beloved brother, her &s;ufferings were re|newed in all their bitterne&s;s. Di&s;engag|ing her&s;elf from the arm that &s;upported her, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed the remains of her brother to her bo&s;om, and bathed them with her tears. The officer intreated &s;he would permit him to lead her from that &s;pot, telling her the flames would &s;oon reach it, and that her life was in danger. "My brother!" &s;he cried, "my beloved bro|ther!" Then, &s;tarting with &s;udden horror, &s;he exclaimed, "Oh merciful Heaven, my father! where's my father?"</P>
<P>She attempted to &s;pring forward, but the officer &s;eized her arm, a&s;&s;ured her that the town was nearly con&s;umed, and en|tirely de&s;erted, and begged &s;he would &s;uf|fer him to conduct her to &s;ome place of &s;helter.</P>
<P>Without daring to ca&s;t her eyes again on the fatal object at her feet, &s;he walked &s;lowly away, leaning on her protector's arm. They turned from the town, and reached the lawn, which led by a gentle
<PB N="250" REF="253">
a&s;cent to her father's hou&s;e. "At the end of this lawn," &s;aid &s;he, "is the dwelling where&mdash;" "Ah, I fear," an&s;wered the &s;tranger; but, before he could proceed, Sophia lifted her eyes and perceived the whole man&s;ion was in flames.</P>
<P>A per&s;on, wringing his hands in all the angui&s;h of de&s;pair, approached: he was her father. She threw her&s;elf on his bo|&s;om; "Have I &s;till my dear father left me?" &s;aid &s;he, in a voice half choaked with &s;obs. "My &s;on!" exclaimed the wretched parent, "my dear boy!"</P>
<P>After a &s;cene which can be better ima|gined than de&s;cribed, Mr. Herbert and his daughter retired to a hamlet in the neigh|bourhood, where the Engli&s;h officer, Capt. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, when he went to vi&s;it them the next day, found Sophia &s;itting by her fa|ther's bed&s;ide, whom fatigue of body, joined to the mo&s;t vehement emotions of mind, had thrown into a fever. His pul&s;e throbbed violently, and his &s;oul &s;eemed bur&s;ting with indignation and de&s;pair.
<PB N="251" REF="254">
Sophia's countenance was pale, and her looks &s;poke the complaints to which her lips refu&s;ed utterance. Soon after Capt. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> reached the cottage, a pea&s;ant led into the room an old man near eighty years of age; who was an Engli&s;hman, that had gone to America in his youth, as the &s;ervant of Mr. Herbert's father, and now pa&s;&s;ed his declining years under the pro|tection of the &s;on. This old man had crawled to the town the preceding night, in &s;earch of his ma&s;ter, and had been &s;een &s;itting under the &s;helter of a barn, by an American countryman who knew him, and led him to the cottage. Sophia flew with eagerne&s;s to meet him: &s;he had been taught to reverence him in infancy, and more advanced years had confirmed the habit of childhood into a &s;entiment of the &s;oul. Robert had &s;erved her grandfather with a &s;implicity of affection, and a pride of integrity, which claimed the warme&s;t re|turns of gratitude. This valuable dome|&s;tic had felt towards his ma&s;ter that &s;en|timent
<PB N="252" REF="255">
of &s;tedfa&s;t fidelity which Naomi expre&s;&s;es to Ruth, in the beautiful lan|guage of Scripture, "Whither thou goe&s;t I will go, and where thou lodge&s;t I will lodge; thy people &s;hall be my people, and thy God &s;hall be my God; where thou die&s;t will I die, and there will I be buried. The Lord do &s;o to me, and more al&s;o, if aught but death part thee and me."</P>
<P>Sophia took the old man's arm from the countryman: "Robert," &s;aid &s;he, "I hope you are not much hurt." "Ah, Mi&s;s Sophy," &s;aid he, &s;haking his head, "no matter, &s;ince you are &s;afe, and my ma&s;ter." "Robert!" &s;aid Mr. Herbert; but his voice &s;eemed choaked, and he did not attempt to proceed. "I &s;ee you are ill, Sir," replied the old man, "and no wonder. Poor Mr. Charles&mdash;I loved him like my own child, and he was plea&s;ed to let me call him &s;o; but the dear youth is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;A flood of tears bedewed the old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> cheeks; he wiped them away with

"I'll &s;ay no more," an&s;wered he, "though, if it had plea&s;ed Heaven to take a poor old man, and &s;pare him"&mdash;"Sit down, and compo&s;e your&s;elf," &s;aid Sophia. The officer a&s;&s;i&s;ted in placing him at the foot of his ma&s;ter's bed. Mr. Herbert fixed his eyes upon him, with a gloomy look, in which de&s;pair was painted. "I am a good deal brui&s;ed," &s;aid the old man. "How were you brui&s;ed, Robert?" &s;aid Mr. Herbert. "La&s;t night, Sir, when I found you were all three gone, what, thought I, &s;hould I &s;tay for here? If any harm happens to them, thought I, I &s;hall have nothing more to live for; &s;o I crawled on, and reached the place where poor Mr. Charles&mdash;" Here the old man pau&s;ed a moment. "I ki&s;&s;ed his poor corp&s;e, Sir, and &s;poke to it, as if it coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> an&s;wer me, and then when the flames came near, I dragged it away as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> could; but my &s;trength failed me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">

fell again&s;t &s;ome &s;tones, that brui&s;ed me a good deal. So I lay all night by my poor young ma&s;ter's &s;ide; and when it grew light, and they came to bury the dead, I ki&s;&s;ed his cold hand, and went a little way off: but I &s;aw where they laid him; I &s;hall know the &s;pot if the gra&s;s <HI>&s;hould</HI> grow over it."</P>
<P>Capt. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> went up to Robert, and begged he would &s;ay no more: Robert an&s;wered, "I have done, Sir; he's in his grave; but if you had known him, Sir, &s;o kind-hearted and &s;o humble he was&mdash;: He has often made me lay hold of his arm, and led me to my wicker &s;eat at the end of the garden. Sit down, Robert, he would &s;ay, and ba&s;k a little in the &s;un, it will do you good: but it's all over now. Yes, Sir," turning to his ma&s;ter, "they have de&s;troyed every thing&mdash;the &s;hrubbery is all cut down, and torn to pieces, except a branch here and there, that is blown by the wind; it would have broke your heart to &s;ee it."</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="258">
Mr. Herbert's fever increa&s;ed, and, for &s;ome days, his life was in danger. Captain F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> brought the &s;urgeon of his regiment to vi&s;it him, and witne&s;&s;ed, in his own frequent vi&s;its to the cottage, the filial piety of Sophia, who watched day and night by the bed-&s;ide of her fa|ther, attended him with unremitting ten|derne&s;s, and at length had the con&s;olation of &s;eeing his health re&s;tored.</P>
<P>You will not wonder, Sir, that tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es which rendered Sophia's beauty more touching, and &s;erved to di&s;play the virtues of her heart, &s;oon converted Cap|tain F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s pity into the enthu&s;ia&s;m of pa&s;&s;ion.

When Sophia had de&s;cribed to me the melancholy pic|ture they pre&s;ented, &s;he added the&s;e words&mdash;"I could bear to gaze upon the ruins of that once happy dwelling, did I con&s;ider them merely as the relics of lo&s;t &s;plendor: but it was the &s;cene of all my plea&s;ures! this is what affects me. Had the &s;ame ties, the &s;ame &s;oothing re|collections, endeared the &s;helter of a cot|tage, the &s;traw that thatched its roof would have been &s;acred, and called forth my affections as forcibly as the man&s;ion which is laid in du&s;t. Pa&s;&s;ing by the &s;ide of that &s;mall &s;tream which runs near the bottom of the lawn, I &s;aw &s;ome of the &s;ticks with

which my father had him&s;elf formed my laurel bower, taken away by the current. They floated on the &s;urface of the water; I looked after them with a vehement &s;en|&s;ation, which I almo&s;t tremble to recall. When I turned, I &s;pied &s;ome &s;cattered branches of the laurel, which he had twi&s;ted round tho&s;e very &s;ticks, withering on the ground: I &s;natched them up in|&s;tantly, bathed them with my tears, and have pre&s;erved them till their la&s;t leaf is withered."</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert placed his daughter un|der my mother's protection, and &s;oon af|ter joined the army. Their &s;eparation was final; he fell in the fir&s;t engagement; and Sophia, in the mid&s;t of her affliction at this event, received a mo&s;t angry letter from her brother in Pen&s;ylvania, who had heard with the utmo&s;t indignation of her engagements to Captain F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, and &s;eemed to feel le&s;s concern for his father's death, than regret at the weakne&s;s which had led him to be&s;tow his daughter on a
<PB N="258" REF="261">
man who had drawn his &s;word again&s;t America.</P>
<P>Sophia lamented the prejudices of her brother, but determined to adhere invio|lably to tho&s;e engagements on which all her hopes of happine&s;s depended, and which had received the &s;anction of paren|tal authority. In the mean time &s;he count|ed the hours of &s;eparation, which &s;he be|lieved, though long and melancholy, would at length pa&s;s away, and re&s;tore the object of her affection.</P>
<P>While &s;he indulged this fond illu&s;ion, your letter, conveying the fatal tidings of Captain F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s death, arrived. So|phia received this intelligence without complaint. She &s;hed no tear, but her blood &s;eemed chilled in her veins: &s;he &s;tarted frequently, and there was a wild|ne&s;s and di&s;order in her countenance, that alarmed us for her rea&s;on. She was put to bed, her pul&s;e beat high, the &s;truggles which for &s;ome time pa&s;t &s;he had undergone, had weakened a frame
<PB N="259" REF="262">
naturally delicate. This la&s;t &s;troke &s;he was unable to &s;u&s;tain, her fever increa&s;ed every moment, and the following night her rea&s;on entirely for&s;ook her. I per|ceived a &s;udden change in her manner that &s;hocked me. "Do not be unea&s;y," &s;aid &s;he, "I am better&mdash;much better&mdash;that bloody engagement at Long I&s;land!&mdash;and yet he's &s;afe&mdash;it was fooli&s;h to be &s;o unea&s;y&mdash;I cried for whole nights to|gether&mdash;my head &s;till burns."</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician, who now entered the room, &s;he mi&s;took for her brother, and &s;hrieked at the &s;ight of him. "Oh my God!" cried the unhappy Sophia, "he's dead&mdash;and that's his murderer."&mdash;Then falling on her knees, "Save him&mdash;&s;ave him yet," &s;aid &s;he, "have you the cruelty to kill him?&mdash;he loves you&mdash;indeed he does&mdash;I'm your &s;i&s;ter&mdash;don't break my heart&mdash;&s;pare him&mdash;&s;pare him&mdash;Oh it's too late!&mdash;you've murdered him already:&mdash;fly&mdash;fly, my beloved&mdash;all that's deare&s;t to my heart!&mdash;all that's left me on earth!
<PB N="260" REF="263">
fly for my &s;ake&mdash;here&mdash;here&mdash;I'm ready to die&mdash;why look &s;o at me?&mdash;<HI>I</HI> can't &s;ave you!&mdash;how he groans!&mdash;he's covered with blood&mdash;I can bear it no longer." She &s;prang up in her bed, but, overcome by the&s;e violent emotions, &s;unk back in a kind of &s;tupor: I knelt by her bed-&s;ide, and &s;he again revived a little. "Is that Cap|tain F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">?" cried &s;he, putting out her hand, "Heaven&mdash;Heaven pre&s;erve!&mdash;Write whenever the battle's over&mdash;I &s;hall have no re&s;t till a letter comes." "Do you not know me, my dear friend," &s;aid I, taking her hand. "Yes, yes, there's no occa&s;ion to kneel&mdash;tell my brother I con|&s;ent to our parting&mdash;but I can never love again&mdash;I never lov'd but one!&mdash;Who &s;tands there?&mdash;mercy!&mdash;mercy! my bro|ther!&mdash;bury your&s;elf deep in earth&mdash;he's dead&mdash;quite dead&mdash;would you kill him in the grave?&mdash;have you no pity?&mdash;Oh, he fea&s;ts on my tears!&mdash;he &s;corns me!"</P>
<P>Again exhau&s;ted by the&s;e efforts, &s;he &s;unk into almo&s;t total in&s;en&s;ibility; in
<PB N="261" REF="264">
which &s;tate &s;he remained &s;ome hours: her pul&s;e grew weaker every moment, and, as death approached, her rea&s;on was in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;tored. She again opened her eyes, and a&s;ked for me; I flew to her. "My dear Frances," &s;aid &s;he, in a faint voice, "I feel my&s;elf dying: to you, my dear friend, I leave the care of our poor old &s;ervant; comfort, comfort the good old man for our lo&s;s." Then, lifting up her hands and eyes, "Oh, my Creator and my judge," cried &s;he, "Thou, whom I have &s;ought in the &s;incerity of my &s;oul; thou, who&s;e bounties in the days of my happine&s;s I loved to acknowledge, for|give me if I have &s;uffered affliction to prey too much upon my heart, and have &s;hortened my life! Thou can&s;t witne&s;s, that amid&s;t my &s;orrows, never has one murmuring thought ari&s;en again&s;t thee! Oh, be&s;t of beings! object neare&s;t to my heart! of thy benevolence and goodne&s;s it has never doubted for a moment. When thy di&s;pen&s;ations appeared dark and my&s;terious, I have looked round on na|ture,
<PB N="262" REF="265">
and &s;een it beaming with benig|nity and beauty. I have &s;earched my own brea&s;t, and found it formed for happine&s;s and virtue; and thou ha&s;t not formed it thus in vain. Thou wilt ju&s;tify thy ways: thou ha&s;t afflicted me on earth, but my &s;ufferings are pa&s;t, and thou wilt make me for ever happy in thy pre&s;ence." Her voice now faltered&mdash;&s;he looked on me&mdash;and expired. Oh, my friend! my &s;weet, my amiable companion! You, who&s;e heart, far from being wrapped in &s;elfi&s;h woe, could forget its own &s;ufferings to comfort the unhappy; you, who&s;e &s;oothing pity could heal the wounds of the afflicted; who &s;eemed born, in this period of general di&s;tre&s;s, to lighten the burden of human wretchedne&s;s; to be the mini&s;tering angel of &s;orrow!&mdash;where &s;hall the de&s;olate mourner now look round for aid? He a&s;ks thy &s;ympathy, but thou can&s;t not hear his complaint: it is only poured to the cold earth that covers thee! Oh, when I think of all thy perfections, the tenderne&s;s of thy di&s;po&s;ition, the virtues of thy heart,
<PB N="263" REF="266">
how can I live without thee? How can I drag on a wretched exi&s;tence which thy friend&s;hip endears no longer? But thou art happy. Yes, &s;he is united to that amiable and unfortunate lover, whom &s;he could not &s;urvive.</P>
<P>I have been vi&s;iting the grave where the remains of my friend repo&s;e. I have poured out my complaints; but the &s;or|row I feel is not for her, but for my&s;elf. She is at re&s;t, and this cruel war had made her happine&s;s impo&s;&s;ible. Alas, how dread|ful are the effects of war! Every form of evil and mi&s;ery is in its train: the groans of de&s;pair are mingled with the &s;ong of triumph, and the laurels of vic|tory are nouri&s;hed with the tears of hu|manity.</P>
