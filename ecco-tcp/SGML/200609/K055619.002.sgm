<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE at la&s;t &s;ent you all Lord Hailes's papers. While I was in France, I looked very often into Henault; but Lord Hailes, in my opinion, leaves him far, and far, behind. Why I did not di&s;patch &s;o &s;hort a peru&s;al &s;ooner, when I look back, I am utterly unable to di&s;cover: but human moments are &s;tolen away by a thou&s;and petty impediments which leave no trace behind them. I have been afflicted, through the whole Chri&s;tmas, with the general di&s;order, of which the wor&s;t effect was a cough, which is now much mitigated, though the country, on which I look from a window at Streatham, is now covered with a deep &s;now. Mrs. Williams is very ill: every body el&s;e is as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Among the papers, I found a letter to you, which I think you had not opened; and a paper for 'The Chronicle,' which I &s;uppo&s;e it not nece&s;&s;ary now to in&s;ert. I return them both.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3" MS="y">

</LETTER>
<P>At this time was in agitation a matter of great con&s;equence to me and my family, which I &s;hould not obtrude upon the world, were it not that the part which Dr. John&s;on's friend&s;hip for me made him take in it was the occa&s;ion of an exertion of his abilities, which it would be inju&s;tice to conceal. That what he wrote upon the &s;ubject may be under&s;tood, it is nece&s;&s;ary to give a &s;tate of the que&s;tion, which I &s;hall do as briefly as I can.</P>
<P>In the year 1504, the barony or manour of Auchinleck, (pronounced <HI>Affleck,)</HI> in Ayr&s;hire, which belonged to a family of the &s;ame name with the lands, having fallen to the Crown by forfeiture, James the Fourth, King of Scotland, granted it to Thomas Bo&s;well, a branch of an ancient family in the county of Fife, &s;tiling him in the charter, <Q REND="inline">"dilecto familiari no&s;tro;"</Q> and a&s;&s;igning, as the cau&s;e of the grant, <Q REND="inline">"pro bono et fideli &s;ervitio nobis prae&s;tito."</Q> Thomas Bo&s;well was &s;lain in battle, fighting along with his Sovereign, at the fatal field of Floddon, in 1513.</P>
<P>From this very honourable founder of our family, the e&s;tate was tran&s;mitted, in a direct &s;eries of heirs male, to David Bo&s;well, my father's great grand uncle, who had no &s;ons, but four daughters, who were all re&s;pectably married, the elde&s;t to Lord Cathcart.</P>
<P>David Bo&s;well, being re&s;olute in the military feudal principle of continuing the male &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, pa&s;&s;ed by his daughters, and &s;ettled the e&s;tate on his nephew by his next brother, who approved of the deed, and renounced any preten&s;ions which he might po&s;&s;ibly have, in preference to his &s;on. But the e&s;tate having been burthened with large portions to the daughters, and other debts, it was nece&s;&s;ary for the nephew to &s;ell a con&s;iderable part of it, and what remained was &s;till much encumbered.</P>
<P>The frugality of the nephew pre&s;erved, and, in &s;ome degree, relieved the e&s;tate. His &s;on, my grandfather, an eminent lawyer, not only re-purcha&s;ed a great part of what had been &s;old, but acquired other lands; and my father,
<PB N="3" REF="4" MS="y">
who was one of the Judges of Scotland, and had added con&s;iderably to the  e&s;tate, now &s;ignified his inclination to take the privilege allowed by our law <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, 1685, Cap&punc; 22.</NOTE>, to &s;ecure it to his family in perpetuity by an entail, which, on account of marriage articles, could not be done without my con&s;ent.</P>
<P>In the plan of entailing the e&s;tate, I heartily concurred with him, though I was the fir&s;t to be re&s;trained by it; but we unhappily differed as to the &s;eries of heirs which &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, or in the language of our law, called to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. My father had declared a predilection for heirs general, that is, males and females indi&s;criminately. He was willing, however, that all males de&s;cending from his grandfather &s;hould be preferred to females; but would not extend that privilege to males deriving their de&s;cent from a higher &s;ource. I, on the other hand, had a zealous partiality for heirs male, however remote, which I maintained, by arguments which appeared to me to have con&s;iderable weight <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>As fir&s;t, the opinion of &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed naturali&s;ts, that our &s;pecies is tran&s;mitted through males only, the female being all along no more than a <HI>nidus,</HI> or nur&s;e, as Mother Farth is to plants of every &s;ort; which notion &s;eems to be confirmed by that text of &s;cripture, <Q REND="inline">"He was yet <HI>in the loins of his</HI> FATHER when Melchi&s;edeck met him."</Q> (Heb. vi. 10.) and con&s;equently, that a man's grand&s;on by a daughter, in&s;tead of being his <HI>&s;ure&s;t</HI> de&s;cendant, as is vulgarly &s;aid, has, in reality, no connection whatever with his blood.&mdash;And &s;econdly, independent of this theory, (which, if true, &s;hould completely exclude heirs general,) that if the preference of a male to a female, without regard to primogeniture, (as a &s;on, though much younger, nay, even a grand&s;on by a &s;on, to a daughter,) be once admitted, as it univer&s;ally is, it mu&s;t be equally rea&s;onable and proper in the mo&s;t remote degree of de&s;cent from an original proprietor of an e&s;tate, as in the neare&s;t; becau&s;e,&mdash;however di&s;tant from the repre&s;entative at the time,&mdash;that remote heir male, upon the failure of tho&s;e nearer to the <HI>original propfietor</HI> than he is, becomes in fact the neare&s;t male to <HI>him,</HI> and is, therefore, preferable as <HI>his</HI> repre&s;entative, to a female de&s;cendant.&mdash;A little exten&s;ion of mind will enable us ea&s;ily to perceive that a &s;on's &s;on, in continuation to whatever length of time, is preferable to a &s;on's daughter, in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to an ancient inheritance; in which regard &s;hould be had to the repre&s;entation of the original proprietor, and not to that of one of his de&s;cendants.</P>
<P>I am aware of Black&s;tone's admirable demon&s;tration of the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the legal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, upon the principle of there being the greate&s;t probability that the neare&s;t heir of the per&s;on who la&s;t dies proprietor of an e&s;tate, is of the blood of the fir&s;t purcha&s;er. But &s;uppo&s;ing a pedigree to be carefully authenticated through all its branches, in&s;tead of mere <HI>pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">bability</HI> there will be a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">rtainty,</HI> that <HI>the neare&s;t heir male, at whate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">r period,</HI> has the &s;ame right of blood with the fir&s;t heir male, namely, <HI>the original pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">r's elde&s;t &s;on.</HI></P></NOTE>. And in the particular ca&s;e of our family, I appre|hended that we were under an implied obligation, in honour and good faith, to tran&s;mit the e&s;tate by the &s;ame tenure which we held it, which was as heirs male, excluding nearer females. I therefore, as I thought con&s;cientiou&s;ly, objected to my father's &s;cheme.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
 My oppo&s;ition was very di&s;plea&s;ing to my father, who was entitled to great re&s;pect and deference; and I had rea&s;on to apprehend di&s;agreeable con&s;equences from my non-compliance with his wi&s;hes. After much perplexity and unea&s;i|ne&s;s, I wrote to Dr. John&s;on, &s;tating the ca&s;e, with all its difficulties, at full length, and earne&s;tly reque&s;ting that he would con&s;ider it at lei&s;ure, and favour me with his friendly opinion and advice.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS much impre&s;&s;ed by your letter, and, if I can form upon your ca&s;e any re&s;olution &s;atisfactory to my&s;elf, will very gladly impart it: but whether I am quite equal to it, I do not know. It is a ca&s;e compounded of law and ju&s;tice, and requires a mind ver&s;ed in juridical di&s;qui&s;itions. Could you not tell your whole mind to Lord Hailes? He is, you know, both a Chri&s;tian and a Lawyer. I &s;uppo&s;e he is above partiality, and above loquacity; and, I believe, he will not think the time lo&s;t in which he may quiet a di&s;turbed, or &s;ettle a wavering mind. Write to me, as any thing occurs to you; and if I find my&s;elf &s;topped by want of facts nece&s;&s;ary to be known, I will make enquiries of you as my doubts ari&s;e.</P>
<P>If your former re&s;olutions &s;hould be found only fanciful, you decide rightly in judging that your father's fancies may claim the preference; but whether they are fanciful or rational, is the que&s;tion. I really think Lord Hailes could help us.</P>
<P>Make my compliments to dear Mrs. Bo&s;well; and tell her, that I hope to be wanting in nothing that I can contribute, to bring you all out of your troubles.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM going to write upon a que&s;tion which requires more knowledge of local law, and more acquaintance with the general rules of inheritance, than I can claim; but I write, becau&s;e you reque&s;t it.</P>
<P>Land is, like any other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by natural right wholly in the power of its pre&s;ent owner; and may be &s;old, given, or bequeathed, ab&s;olutely or conditionally, as judgement &s;hall direct, or pa&s;&s;ion incite.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">
But natural right would avail little without the protection of law; and  the primary notion of law is re&s;traint in the exerci&s;e of natural right. A man is therefore, in &s;ociety, not fully ma&s;ter of what he calls his own, but he &s;till retains all the power which law does not take from him.</P>
<P>In the exerci&s;e of the right which law either leaves or gives, regard is to be paid to moral obligations.</P>
<P>Of the e&s;tate which we are now con&s;idering, your father &s;till retains &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, with &s;uch power over it, that he can &s;ell it, and do with the money what he will, without any legal impediment. But when he extends his power beyond his own life, by &s;ettling the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the law makes your con&s;ent nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e that he &s;ells the land to ri&s;k the money in &s;ome &s;pecious adventure, and in that adventure lo&s;es the whole: his po&s;terity would be di&s;appointed; but they could not think them&s;elves injured or robbed. If he &s;pent it upon vice or plea&s;ure, his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors could only call him vicious and voluptuous; they could not &s;ay that he was injurious or unju&s;t.</P>
<P>He that may do more, may do le&s;s. He that, by &s;elling or &s;quandering, may di&s;inherit a whole family, may certainly di&s;inherit part, by a partial &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>Laws are formed by the manners and exigencies of particular times, and it is but accidental that they la&s;t longer than their cau&s;es: the limitation of feudal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the male aro&s;e from the obligation of the tenant to attend his chief in war.</P>
<P>As times and opinions are always changing, I know not whether it be not u&s;urpation to pre&s;cribe rules to po&s;terity, by pre&s;uming to judge of what we cannot know; and I know not whether I fully approve either your de&s;ign or your father's, to limit that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion which de&s;cended to you unlimited. If we are to leave <HI>&s;artum tectum</HI> to po&s;terity, what we have without any merit of our own received from our ance&s;tors, &s;hould not choice and free-will be kept unviolated? Is land to be treated with more reverence than liberty?&mdash;If this con&s;ideration &s;hould re&s;train your father from di&s;inheriting &s;ome of the males, does it leave you the power of di&s;inheriting all the females?</P>
<P>Can the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a feudal e&s;tate make any will? Can he appoint, out of the inheritance, any portions to his daughters? There &s;eems to be a very &s;hadowy difference between the power of leaving land, and of leaving money to be rai&s;ed from land; between leaving an e&s;tate to females, and leaving the male heir, in effect, only their &s;teward.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e at one time a law that allowed only males to inherit, and during the continuance of this law many e&s;tates to have de&s;cended, pa&s;&s;ing by the females, to remoter heirs. Suppo&s;e afterwards the law repealed in cor|re&s;pondence
<PB N="6" REF="7">
 with a change of manners, and women made capable of inheri|tance; would not then the tenure of e&s;tates be changed? Could the women have no benefit from a law made in their favour? Mu&s;t they be pa&s;&s;ed by upon moral principles for ever, becau&s;e they were once excluded by a legal prohibition? Or may that which pa&s;&s;ed only to males by one law, pa&s;s likewi&s;e to females by another?</P>
<P>You mention your re&s;olution to maintain the right of your brothers <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Which term I applied to all the heirs male.</NOTE>. I do not &s;ee how any of their rights are invaded.</P>
<P>As your whole difficulty ari&s;es from the act of your ance&s;tor, who diverted the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from the females, you enquire, very properly, what were his motives, and what was his intention; for you certainly are not bound by his act more than he intended to bind you, nor hold your land on harder or &s;tricter terms than tho&s;e on which it was granted.</P>
<P>Intentions mu&s;t be gathered from acts. When he left the e&s;tate to his nephew, by excluding his daughters, was it, or was it not, in his power to have perpetuated the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the males? If he could have done it, he &s;eems to have &s;hewn, by omitting it, that he did not de&s;ire it to be done; and, upon your own principles, you will not ea&s;ily prove your right to de&s;troy that capacity of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion which your ance&s;tors have left.</P>
<P>If your ance&s;tor had not the power of making a perpetual &s;ettlement; and if, therefore, we cannot judge di&s;tinctly of his intentions, yet his act can only be con&s;idered as an example; it makes not an obligation. And, as you ob&s;erve, he &s;et no example of rigorous adherence to the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He that overlooked a brother, would not wonder that little regard is &s;hewn to remote relations.</P>
<P>As the rules of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion are, in a great part, purely legal, no man can be &s;uppo&s;ed to bequeath any thing, but upon legal terms; he can grant no power which the law denies; and if he makes no &s;pecial and definite limita|tion, he confers all the powers which the law allows.</P>
<P>Your ance&s;tor, for &s;ome rea&s;on, di&s;inherited his daughters; but it no more follows that he intended his act as a rule for po&s;terity, than the di&s;inheriting of his brother.</P>
<P>If therefore, you a&s;k by what right your father admits daughters to inheritance, a&s;k your&s;elf, fir&s;t, by what right you require them to be excluded?</P>
<P>It appears, upon reflection, that your father excludes nobody; he only admits nearer females to inherit before males more remote; and the exclu&s;ion is purely con&s;equential.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8" MS="y">
The&s;e, dear Sir, are my thoughts, immethodical and deliberative; but,  perhaps, you may find in them &s;ome glimmering of evidence.</P>
<P>I cannot, however, but again recommend to you a conference with Lord Hailes, whom you know to be both a Lawyer and a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Make my compliments to Mrs. Bo&s;well, though &s;he does not love me.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I had followed his recommendation and con&s;ulted Lord Hailes, who upon this &s;ubject had a firm opinion contrary to mine. His Lord&s;hip obligingly took the trouble to write me a letter, in which he di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with legal and hi&s;torical learning, the points in which I &s;aw much difficulty, maintaining that <Q REND="inline">"the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of heirs general was the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by the law of Scotland, from the throne to the cottage, as far as we can learn it by record;"</Q> ob&s;erving that the e&s;tate of our family had not been limited to heirs male, and that though an heir male had in one in&s;tance been cho&s;en in preference to nearer females, that had been an arbitrary act, which had &s;eemed to be be&s;t in the embarra&s;&s;ed &s;tate of affairs at that time; and the fact was, that upon a fair computation of the value of land and money at the time, applied to the e&s;tate and the burthens upon it, there was nothing given to the heir male but the &s;keleton of an e&s;tate, <Q REND="inline">"The plea of con&s;cience (&s;aid his Lord&s;hip) which you put, is a mo&s;t re&s;pectable one, e&s;pecially when <HI>con&s;cience</HI> and <HI>&s;elf</HI> are on different &s;ides. But I think that con&s;cience is not well informed, and that <HI>&s;elf</HI> and <HI>&s;he</HI> ought on this occa&s;ion to be of a &s;ide."</Q></P>
<P>This letter, which had con&s;iderable influence upon my mind, I &s;ent to Dr. John&s;on, begging to hear from him again, upon this intere&s;ting que&s;tion.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD><HI>To</HI> JAMES BOSWELL, <HI>E&s;q.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING not any acquaintance with the laws or cu&s;toms of Scotland, I endeavoured to con&s;ider your que&s;tion upon general principles, and found nothing of much validity that I could oppo&s;e to this po&s;ition. <Q REND="inline">'He who inherits a fief unlimited by his ance&s;tor, inherits the power of limiting it according to his own judgement or opinion.'</Q> If this be true you may join with your father.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">
 Further con&s;ideration produced another conclu&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">'He who receives a fief unlimited by his ance&s;tors, gives his heirs &s;ome rea&s;on to complain if he does not tran&s;mit it unlimited to po&s;terity.'</Q> For why &s;hould he make the &s;tate of others wor&s;e than his own, without a rea&s;on? If this be true, though neither you nor your father are about to do what is quite right, but as your father violates (I think) the legal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion lea&s;t, he &s;eems to be nearer the right than your&s;elf.</P>
<P>It cannot but occur that <Q REND="inline">'Women have natural and equitable claims as well as men, and the&s;e claims are not to be capriciou&s;ly or lightly &s;uper&s;eded or infringed.'</Q> When fiefs implied military &s;ervice, it is ea&s;ily di&s;cerned why females could not inherit them; but that rea&s;on is now at an end. As manners make laws, manners likewi&s;e repeal them.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the general conclu&s;ions which I have attained. None of them are very favourable to your &s;cheme of entail, nor perhaps to any &s;cheme. My ob&s;ervation, that only he who acquires an e&s;tate may bequeath it capriciou&s;ly <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">I had reminded him of his ob&s;ervation mentioned in Vol. I. page 423.</NOTE>, if it contains any conviction includes this po&s;ition likewi&s;e, that only he who acquires an e&s;tate may entail it capriciou&s;ly. But I think it may be &s;afely pre&s;umed, that <Q REND="inline">'he who inherits an e&s;tate inherits all the power legally concomitant.'</Q> And that <Q REND="inline">'He who gives or leaves unlimited an e&s;tate legally limitable, mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to give that power of limitation which he omitted to take away, and to commit future contingencies to future prudence.'</Q> In the&s;e two po&s;itions I believe Lord Hailes will advi&s;e you to re&s;t; every other notion of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;eems to me full of difficulties, and embarra&s;&s;ed with &s;cruples.</P>
<P>If the&s;e axioms be allowed, you have arrived now at full liberty without the help of particular circum&s;tances, which, however, have in your ca&s;e great weight. You very rightly ob&s;erve, that he who pa&s;&s;ing by his brother gave the inheritance to his nephew, could limit no more than he gave, and by Lord Hailes's e&s;timate of fourteen years purcha&s;e, what he gave was no more than you may ea&s;ily entail according to your own opinion, if that opinion &s;hould &s;inally prevail.</P>
<P>Lord Hailes's &s;u&s;picion that entails are encroachments on the dominion of Providence, may be extended to all hereditary privileges and all perma|nent in&s;titutions; I do not &s;ee why it may not be extended to any provi&s;ion but for the pre&s;ent hour, &s;ince all care about futurity proceeds upon a
<PB N="9" REF="10" MS="y">
&s;uppo&s;ition, that we know at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree what will be future. Of  the future we certainly know nothing; but we may form conjectures from the pa&s;t; and the power of forming conjectures, includes, in my opinion, the duty of acting in conformity to that probability which we di&s;cover. Pro|vidence gives the power of which rea&s;on teaches the u&s;e.</P>

I long for a letter, that I may know how this trouble&s;ome and vexatious que&s;tion is at la&s;t decided <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">The entail framed by my father with various judicious clau&s;es, was executed by him and me, &s;ettling the e&s;tate upon the heirs male of his grandfather, which I found had been already done by my grandfather, imperfectly, but &s;o as to be defeated only by &s;elling the lands. I was freed by Dr. John&s;on from &s;cruples of con&s;cientious obligation, and could, therefore, gratify my father. But my opinion and partiality for male &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in its full extent, remained un&s;haken. Yet let me not be thought har&s;h or unkind to daughters; for my notion is, that they &s;hould be treated with great affection and tenderne&s;s, and always participate of the pro&s;perity of the family.</NOTE>. I hope that it will at la&s;t end well. Lord Hailes's letter was very friendly, and very &s;ea&s;onable, but I think his aver&s;ion from entails has &s;omething in it like &s;uper&s;tition. Providence is not counteracted by any means which Providence puts into our power. The continuance and propagation of families makes a great part of the Jewi&s;h law, and is by no means prohibited in the Chri&s;tian in&s;titution, though the nece&s;&s;ity of it continues no longer. Hereditary tenures are e&s;tabli&s;hed in all civili&s;ed countries, and are accompanied in mo&s;t with hereditary authority. Sir William Temple con&s;iders our con&s;titution as defective, that there is not an unalienable e&s;tate in land connected with a peerage: and Lord Bacon mentions as a proof that the Turks are Barbarians, their want of <HI>Stirpes,</HI> as he calls them, or hereditary rank. Do not let your mind, when it
<PB N="10" REF="11" MS="y">
 is freed from the &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity of a rigorous entail, be entangled with contrary objections, and think all entails unlawful, till you have cogent arguments, which I believe you will never find; I am afraid of &s;cruples.</P>
<P>I have now &s;ent all Lord Hailes's papers, part I found hidden in a drawer in which I had laid them for &s;ecurity, and had forgotten them. Part of the&s;e are written twice, I have returned both the copies. Part I had read before.</P>
<P>Be &s;o kind as to return Lord Hailes my mo&s;t re&s;pectful thanks for his fir&s;t volume; his accuracy &s;trikes me with wonder; his narrative is far &s;uperiour to that of Henault, as I have formerly mentioned.</P>
<P>I am afraid that the trouble, which my irregularity and delay has co&s;t him, is greater, far greater, than any good that I can do him will ever recompen&s;e, but if I have any more copy, I will try to do better.</P>
<P>Pray let me know if Mrs. Bo&s;well is friends with me, and pay my re&s;pects to Veronica, and Euphemia, and Alexander.</P>

<P>YOU have illuminated my mind and relieved me from imaginary &s;hackles of con&s;cientious obligation. Were it nece&s;&s;ary, I could immediately join in an entail upon the &s;eries of heirs approved by my father; but it is better not to act too &s;uddenly.</P>

<P>Having communicated to Lord Hailes what Dr. John&s;on wrote concerning the que&s;tion which perplexed me &s;o much, his Lord&s;hip wrote to me, <Q REND="inline">"Your &s;cruples have produced more fruit than I ever expected from them; an excellent di&s;&s;ertation on general principles of morals and law."</Q></P>

<P>Above thirty years ago, the heirs of Lord Chancellor Clarendon pre&s;ented the Univer&s;ity of Oxford with the continuation of his Hi&s;tory, and &s;uch other of his Lord&s;hip's manu&s;cripts as had not been publi&s;hed, on condition that the profits ari&s;ing from their publication &s;hould be applied to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a <HI>Manege</HI> in the Univer&s;ity. The gift was accepted in full convocation. A per&s;on being now recommended to Dr. John&s;on, as fit to &s;uperintend this propo&s;ed riding-&s;chool, he exerted him&s;elf with that zeal for which he was remarkable upon every &s;imilar occa&s;ion. But, on enquiry into the matter, he found that the &s;cheme was not likely to be &s;oon carried into execution; the profits ari&s;ing from the Clarendon pre&s;s being, from &s;ome mi&s;management, very &s;canty. This having been explained to him by a re&s;pectable dignitary of the church, who had good means of knowing it, he wrote a letter upon the &s;ubject, which at once exhibits his extraordinary preci&s;ion and acutene&s;s, and his warm attachment to his ALMA MATER.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To the Reverend Dr. <HI>WETHERELL,</HI> Ma&s;ter of Univer&s;ity-College, Oxford.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FEW things are more unplea&s;ant than the tran&s;action of bu&s;ine&s;s with men who are above knowing or caring what they have to do; &s;uch as the tru&s;tees for Lord Cornbury's in&s;titution will, perhaps, appear, when you have read Dr. *******'s letter.</P>
<P>The la&s;t part of the Doctor's letter is of great importance. The com|plaint<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">I &s;uppo&s;e the complaint was, that the tru&s;tees of the Oxford pre&s;s did not allow the London book&s;ellers a &s;ufficient profit upon vending their publications.</NOTE> which he makes I have heard long ago, and did not know but it was
<PB N="13" REF="14">
redre&s;&s;ed. It is unhappy that a practice &s;o erroneous has not yet been altered;  for altered it mu&s;t be, or our pre&s;s will be u&s;ele&s;s with all its privileges. The book&s;ellers, who, like all other men, have &s;trong prejudices in their own favour, are enough inclined to think the practice of printing and &s;elling books by any but them&s;elves, an encroachment on the rights of their fraternity, and have need of &s;tronger inducements to circulate academical publications than tho&s;e of one another; for, of that mutual co-operation by which the general trade is carried on, the Univer&s;ity can bear no part. Of tho&s;e whom he neither loves nor fears, and from whom he expects no reciprocation of good offices, why &s;hould any man promote the intere&s;t but for profit? I &s;uppo&s;e, with all our &s;chola&s;tick ignorance of mankind, we are &s;till too knowing to expect that the book&s;ellers will erect them&s;elves into patrons, and buy and &s;ell under the influence of a di&s;intere&s;ted zeal for the promotion of learning.</P>
<P>To the book&s;ellers, if we look for either honour or profit from our pre&s;s, not only their common profit, but &s;omething more mu&s;t be allowed; and if books, printed at Oxford, are expected to be rated at a high price, that price mu&s;t be levied on the publick, and paid by the ultimate purcha&s;er, not by the intermediate agents. What price &s;hall be &s;et upon the book, is, to the book&s;ellers, wholly indifferent, provided that they gain a proportionate profit by negociating the &s;ale.</P>
<P>Why books printed at Oxford &s;hould be particularly dear, I am, how|ever, unable to find. We pay no rent; we inherit many of our in&s;truments and materials; lodging and victuals are cheaper than at London; and, there|fore, workman&s;hip ought, at lea&s;t, not to be dearer. Our expences are naturally le&s;s than tho&s;e of book&s;ellers; and, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, communities are content with le&s;s profit than individuals.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, not con&s;idered through how many hands a book often pa&s;&s;es, before it comes into tho&s;e of the reader; or what part of the profit each hand mu&s;t retain, as a motive for tran&s;mitting it to the next.</P>
<P>We will call our primary agent in London, Mr. Cadell, who receives our books from us, gives them room in his warehou&s;e, and i&s;&s;ues them on demand; by him they are &s;old to Mr. Dilly, a whole&s;ale book&s;eller, who &s;ends them into the country; and the la&s;t &s;eller is the country book&s;eller. Here are three profits to be paid between the printer and the reader, or in the &s;tyle of commerce, between the manufacturer and the con&s;umer; and if any of the&s;e profits is too penuriou&s;ly di&s;tributed, the proce&s;s of commerce is interrupted.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15" MS="y">
 We are now come to the practical que&s;tion, what is to be done? You will tell me, with rea&s;on, that I have &s;aid nothing, till I declare how much, according to my opinion, of the ultimate price ought to be di&s;tributed through the whole &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ale.</P>
<P>The deduction, I am afraid, will appear very great: but let it be con|&s;idered before it is refu&s;ed. We mu&s;t allow, for profit, between thirty and thirty-five <HI>per cent.</HI> between &s;ix and &s;even &s;hillings in the pound; that is, for every book which co&s;ts the la&s;t buyer twenty &s;hillings, we mu&s;t charge Mr. Cadell with &s;omething le&s;s than fourteen. We mu&s;t &s;et the copies at fourteen &s;hillings each, and &s;uperadd what is called the quarterly-book, or for every hundred books &s;o charged we mu&s;t deliver an hundred and four.</P>
<P>The profits will then &s;tand thus:</P>
<P>Mr. Cadell, who runs no hazard, and gives no credit, will be paid for warehou&s;e room and attendance by a &s;hilling profit on each book, and his chance of the quarterly-book.</P>
<P>Mr. Dilly, who buys the book for fifteen &s;hillings, and who will expect the quarterly-book if he takes five-and twenty, will &s;ell it to his country cu&s;|tomer at &s;ixteen and &s;ix-pence, by which, at the hazard of lo&s;s, and the certainty of long credit, he gains the regular profit of ten <HI>per cent.</HI> which is expected in the whole&s;ale trade.</P>
<P>The country book&s;eller, buying at &s;ixteen and &s;ix-pence, and commonly tru&s;ting a con&s;iderable time, gains but three and &s;ix-pence, and, if he tru&s;ts a year, not much more than two and &s;ix-pence; otherwi&s;e than as he may, perhaps, take as long credit as he gives.</P>
<P>With le&s;s profit than this, and more you &s;ee he cannot have, the country book&s;eller cannot live; for his receipts are &s;mall, and his debts &s;ometimes bad.</P>
<P>Thus, dear Sir, I have been incited by Dr. *******'s letter to give you a detail of the circulation of books, which, perhaps, every man has not had opportunity of knowing; and which tho&s;e who know it, do not, per|haps, always di&s;tinctly con&s;ider.</P>

<P><PB N="15" REF="16" MS="y">
Having arrived in London late on Friday, the 15th of March, I ha&s;tened  next morning to wait on Dr. John&s;on, at his hou&s;e; but found he was removed from John&s;on's-court, No. 7, to Bolt-court, No. 8, &s;till keeping to his favourite Fleet-&s;treet. My reflection at the time upon this change as marked in my Journal, is, as follows, <Q REND="inline">"I felt a fooli&s;h regret that he had left a court which bore his name; but it was not fooli&s;h to be affected with &s;ome tenderne&s;s of regard for a place in which I had &s;een him a great deal, from whence I had often i&s;&s;ued a better and a happier man than when I went in, and which had often appeared to my imagination while I trod its pavement, in the &s;olemn darkne&s;s of the night, to be &s;acred to wi&s;dom and piety."</Q> Being informed that he was at Mr. Thrale's, in the Borough, I ha&s;tened thither, and found Mrs. Thrale and him at breakfa&s;t. I was kindly welcomed. In a moment he was in a full glow of conver&s;ation, and I felt my&s;elf elevated as if brought into another &s;tate of being. Mrs. Thrale and I looked to each other while he talked, and our looks expre&s;&s;ed our congenial admiration and affection for him. I &s;hall ever recollect this &s;cene with great plea&s;ure. I exclaimed to her, <Q REND="inline">"I am now, intellectually, <HI>Hermippus redivivus,</HI> I am quite re&s;tored by him, by transfu&s;ion of <HI>mind.</HI>"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"There are many (&s;he replied,) who admire and re&s;pect Mr. John&s;on, but you and I <HI>love</HI> him."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;eemed very happy in the near pro&s;pect of going to Italy with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale. <Q REND="inline">"But (&s;aid he,) before leaving England I am to take a jaunt to Oxford, Birmingham, my native city Lichfield, and my old friend, Dr. Taylor's, at A&s;hbourne, in Derby&s;hire. I &s;hall go in a few days, and you, Bo&s;well, &s;hall go with me."</Q> I was ready to accompany him; being willing even to leave London to have the plea&s;ure of his conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I mentioned with much regret the extravagance of the repre&s;entative of a great family in Scotland, by which there was danger of its being ruined; and as John&s;on re&s;pected it for its antiquity, he joined with me in thinking it would be happy if this per&s;on &s;hould die. Mrs. Thrale &s;eemed &s;hocked at this, as feudal barbarity; and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I do not under&s;tand this preference of the e&s;tate to its owner; of the land to the man who walks upon that land."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Madam, it is not a preference of the land to its owner; it is the preference of a family to an individual. Here is an e&s;tabli&s;hment in a country, which is of importance for ages not only to the chief but to his people; an e&s;tabli&s;hment which extends upwards and downwards; that this &s;hould be de&s;troyed by one idle fellow is a &s;ad thing."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17" MS="y">
 He &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Entails are good, becau&s;e it is good to pre&s;erve in a country, &s;erieses of men, to whom the people are accu&s;tomed to look up as to their leaders. But I am for leaving a quantity of land in commerce, to excite indu&s;try and keep money in the country; for if no land were to be bought in a country, there would be no encouragement to acquire wealth, becau&s;e a family could not be founded there; or if it were acquired, it mu&s;t be carried away to another country where land may be bought. And although the land in every country will remain the &s;ame, and be as fertile where there is no money, as where there is, yet all that portion of the happine&s;s of civil life, which is produced by money circulating in a country, would be lo&s;t."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, would it be for the advantage of a country that all its lands were &s;old at once?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"So far, Sir, as money produces good it would be an advantage; for, then that country would have as much money circu|lating in it as it is worth. But to be &s;ure this would be counterbalanced by di&s;advantages attending a total change of proprietors."</Q></P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed my opinion that the power of entailing &s;hould be limited thus: <Q REND="inline">"That there &s;hould be one third, or perhaps one half of the land of a country kept free for commerce; that the proportion allowed to be entailed, &s;hould be parcelled out &s;o as that no family could entail above a certain quantity. Let a family according to the abilities of its repre&s;entatives, be richer or poorer in different generations, or always rich if its repre&s;entatives be always wi&s;e: but let its ab&s;olute permanency be moderate. In this way we &s;hould be certain of there being always a number of e&s;tabli&s;hed roots; and as in the cour&s;e of nature, there is in every age an extinction of &s;ome families, there would be continual openings for men ambitious of perpetuity, to plant a &s;tock in the entail ground <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">The privilege of perpetuating in a family an e&s;tate and arms <HI>indefea&s;ibly</HI> from generation to generation, is enjoyed by none of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects except in Scotland, where the legal fiction of a <HI>fiue and recovery</HI> is unknown. It is a privilege &s;o proud, that I &s;hould think it would be proper to have the exerci&s;e of it dependent on the royal prerogative. It &s;eems ab&s;urd to permit the power of perpetuating their repre&s;entation, to men, who having had no eminent merit, have truly no name. The King, as the impartial father of his people, would never refu&s;e to grant the privilege to tho&s;e who de&s;erved it.</NOTE>.</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, mankind will be better able to regu|late the &s;y&s;tem of entails, when the evil of too much land being locked up by them is felt, than we can do at pre&s;ent when it is not felt."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned Dr. Adam Smith's book on <Q REND="inline">"The Wealth of Nations,"</Q> which was ju&s;t publi&s;hed, and that Sir John Pringle had ob&s;erved to me, that Dr. Smith, who had never been in trade, could not be expected to write well
<PB N="17" REF="18" MS="y">
on that &s;ubject any more than a lawyer upon phy&s;ick. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"He is  mi&s;taken, Sir; a man who has never been engaged in trade him&s;elf may undoubtedly write well upon trade, and there is nothing which requires more to be illu&s;trated by philo&s;ophy than trade does. As to mere wealth, that is to &s;ay, money, it is clear that one nation or one individual cannot increa&s;e its &s;tore but by making another poorer: but trade procures what is more valu|able, the reciprocation of the peculiar advantages of different countries. A merchant &s;eldom thinks but of his own particular trade. To write a good book upon it, a man mu&s;t have exten&s;ive views. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to have practi&s;ed, to write well upon a &s;ubject."</Q> I mentioned law as a &s;ubject on which no man could write well without practice. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, in England, where &s;o much money is to be got by the practice of the law, mo&s;t of our writers upon it have been in practice; though Black&s;tone had not been much in practice when he publi&s;hed his 'Commentaries.' But upon the Continent, the great writers on law have not all been in practice: Grotius, indeed, was; but Puffendorf was not, Burlamaqui was not."</Q></P>
<P>When we had talked of the great con&s;equence which a man acquired by being employed in his profe&s;&s;ion, I &s;ugge&s;ted a doubt of the ju&s;tice of the general opinion, that it is improper in a lawyer to &s;olicit employment; for why, I urged, &s;hould it not be equally allowable to &s;olicit that as the means of con&s;equence, as it is to &s;olicit votes to be elected a member of parliament? Mr. Strahan had told me, that a countryman of his and mine, who had ri&s;en to eminence in the law, had, when fir&s;t making his way, &s;olicited him to get him employed in city cau&s;es. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is wrong to &s;tir up law-&s;uits; but when once it is certain that a law-&s;uit is to go on, there is nothing wrong in a lawyer's endeavouring that he &s;hall have the benefit rather than another."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"You would not &s;olicit employment, Sir, if you were a lawyer."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; but not becau&s;e I &s;hould think it wrong, but becau&s;e I &s;hould di&s;dain it."</Q> This was a good di&s;tinction, which will be felt by men of ju&s;t pride. He proceeded: <Q REND="inline">"However, I would not have a lawyer to be wanting to him&s;elf in u&s;ing fair means. I would have him to inject a little hint now and then, to prevent his being overlooked."</Q></P>
<P>Lord Moun&s;tuart's bill for a Scotch militia, in &s;upporting which his Lord|&s;hip had made an able &s;peech in the Hou&s;e of Commons, was now a pretty general topick of conver&s;ation.&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"As Scotland contributes &s;o little land-tax towards the general &s;upport of the nation&punc; ought not to have a militia paid out of the general fund, unle&s;s it &s;hould be thought for the general intere&s;t, that Scotland &s;hould be protected from an inva&s;ion, which no man
<PB N="18" REF="19" MS="y">
 can think will happen; for what enemy would invade Scotland, where there is nothing to be got? No, Sir; now that the Scotch have not the pay of Engli&s;h &s;oldiers &s;pent among them, as &s;o many troops are &s;ent abroad, they are trying to get money another way by having a militia paid. If they are afraid, and &s;eriou&s;ly de&s;ire to have an armed force to defend them, they &s;hould pay for it. Your &s;cheme is to retain a part of your little land-tax, by making us pay and clothe your militia."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"You &s;hould not talk of <HI>we</HI> and <HI>you,</HI> Sir; there is now an <HI>Union.</HI>"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"There mu&s;t be a di&s;tinction of intere&s;t, while the proportions of land-tax are &s;o unequal. If York&s;hire &s;hould &s;ay, 'In&s;tead of paying our land-tax, we will keep a greater number of militia,' it would be unrea&s;onable."</Q> In this argument my friend was certainly in the wrong. The land-tax is as unequally proportioned between different parts of England, as between England and Scotland; nay, it is con&s;iderably unequal in Scotland it&s;elf. But the land-tax is but a &s;mall part of the numerous branches of publick revenue, all of which Scotland pays preci&s;ely as England does. A French inva&s;ion made in Scotland would &s;oon penetrate into England.</P>
<P>He thus di&s;cour&s;ed upon &s;uppo&s;ed obligations in &s;ettling e&s;tates:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Where a man gets the unlimited property of an e&s;tate, there is no obligation upon him in <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> to leave it to one per&s;on rather than to another. There is a motive of preference from <HI>kindne&s;s,</HI> and this kindne&s;s is generally entertained for the neare&s;t relation. If I <HI>owe</HI> a particular man a &s;um of money, I am obliged to let that man have the next money I get, and cannot in ju&s;tice let another have it: but if I owe money to no man, I may di&s;po&s;e of what I get as I plea&s;e.

If I have a brother in want, he has a claim from affection to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance: but if I have al&s;o a brother in want, whom I like better, he has a preferable claim. The right of an heir at law is only this, that he is to have the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to an e&s;tate, in ca&s;e no other per&s;on is appointed to it by the owner.

<P>We got into a boat to cro&s;s over to Black-friars; and as we moved along the Thames, I talked to him of a little volume, which, altogether unknown to him, was adverti&s;ed to be publi&s;hed in a few days, under the title of <Q REND="inline">"<HI>John&s;oniana,</HI> or <HI>Bon Mots</HI> of Dr. John&s;on."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is a mighty impudent thing."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, could you have no redre&s;s if you were to pro&s;ecute a publi&s;her for bringing out, under your name, what you never &s;aid, and a&s;cribing to you dull &s;tupid non&s;en&s;e, or making you &s;wear profanely, as many ignorant relaters of your <HI>bon mots</HI> do?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No,

Sir; there will always be &s;ome truth mixed with the fal&s;ehood, and how can  it be a&s;certained how much is true and how much is fal&s;e?

<P>He was, perhaps, above &s;uffering from &s;uch &s;purious publications; but I could not help thinking, that many men would be much injured in their reputation, by having ab&s;urd and vicious &s;ayings imputed to them; and that redre&s;s ought in &s;uch ca&s;es to be given.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"The value of every &s;tory depends on its being true. A &s;tory is a picture either of an individual or of human nature in general: if it be fal&s;e, it is a picture of nothing. For in&s;tance: &s;uppo&s;e a man &s;hould tell that John&s;on, before &s;etting out for Italy, as he had to cro&s;s the Alps, fat down to make him&s;elf wings. This many people would believe; but it would be a picture of nothing. ******* (naming a worthy friend of ours,) u&s;ed to think a &s;tory, a &s;tory, till I &s;hewed him that truth was e&s;&s;ential to it."</Q> I ob&s;erved, that Foote entertained us with &s;tories which were not true; but that, indeed, it was properly not as narratives that Foote's &s;tories plea&s;ed us, but as collections of ludicrous images. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Foote is quite impartial, for he tells lies of every body."</Q></P>
<P>The importance of &s;trict and &s;crupulous veracity cannot be too often incul|cated. John&s;on was known to be &s;o rigidly attentive to it, that even in his common conver&s;ation the &s;lighte&s;t circum&s;tance was mentioned with exact preci&s;ion. The knowledge of his having &s;uch a principle and habit made his friends have a perfect reliance on the truth of every thing that he told, how|ever it might have been doubted if told by many others. As an in&s;tance of this, I may mention an odd incident which he related as having happened to him one night in Fleet-&s;treet. <Q REND="inline">"A gentlewoman (&s;aid he) begged I would give her my arm to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in cro&s;&s;ing the &s;treet, which I accordingly did; upon which &s;he offered me a &s;hilling, &s;uppo&s;ing me to be the watchman.

 I found him in the evening in Mrs. Williams's room. We talked of religious orders. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It is as unrea&s;onable for a man to go into a Car|thu&s;ian convent, for fear of being immoral, as for a man to cut off his hands for fear he &s;hould &s;teal. There is, indeed, great re&s;olution in the immediate act of di&s;membering him&s;elf; but when that is once done, he has no longer any merit: for though it is out of his power to &s;teal, yet he may all his life be a thief in his heart. So when a man has once become a Carthu&s;ian, he is obliged to continue &s;o, whether he choo&s;es it or not. Their &s;ilence, too, is ab&s;urd. We read in the go&s;pel of the apo&s;tles being &s;ent to preach, but not to hold their tongues. All &s;everity that does not tend to increa&s;e good, or prevent evil, is idle. I &s;aid to the Lady Abbe&s;s of a convent, 'Madam, you are here, not for the love of virtue, but the fear of vice.' She &s;aid, 'She &s;hould remember this as long as &s;he lived."</Q> I thought it hard to give her this view of her &s;ituation, when &s;he could not help it; and, indeed, I won|dered at the whole of what he now &s;aid; becau&s;e, both in his <Q REND="inline">"Rambler"</Q> and <Q REND="inline">"Idler,"</Q> he treats religious au&s;terities with much &s;olemnity of re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Finding him &s;till per&s;evering in his ab&s;tinence from wine, I ventured to &s;peak to him of it.&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I have no objection to a man's drinking wine, if he can do it in moderation. I found my&s;elf apt to go to exce&s;s in it, and therefore, after having been for &s;ome time without it, on account of ill|ne&s;s, I thought it better not to return to it. Every man is to judge for him&s;elf, according to the effects which he experiences. One of the fathers tells us, he found fa&s;ting made him &s;o peevi&s;h that he did not practi&s;e it."</Q></P>
<P>Though he often enlarged upon the evil of intoxication, he was by no means har&s;h and unforgiving to tho&s;e who indulged in occa&s;ional exce&s;s in wine. One of his friends, I well remember, came to &s;up at a tavern with him and &s;ome other gentlemen, and too plainly di&s;covered that he had drunk too much at dinner. When one who loved mi&s;chief, thinking to produce a &s;evere cen&s;ure, a&s;ked John&s;on, &s;ome days afterwards, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, what did your friend &s;ay to you, as an apology for being in &s;uch a &s;ituation?"</Q> John&s;on an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he &s;aid all that a man <HI>&s;hould</HI> &s;ay: he &s;aid he was &s;orry for it."</Q></P>
<P>I heard him once give a very judicious practical advice upon this &s;ubject: <Q REND="inline">"A man, (&s;aid he,) who has been drinking wine at all freely, &s;hould never go into a new company&punc; With tho&s;e who have partaken of wine with him, he may be pretty well in uni&s;on; but he will probably be offen&s;ive, or appear ridiculous, to other people.</Q></P>

He allowed very great influence to education. <Q REND="inline">"I do not deny, Sir, but  there is &s;ome original difference in minds; but it is nothing in compari&s;on of what is formed by education. We may in&s;tance the &s;cience of <HI>numbers,</HI> which all minds are equally capable of attaining; yet we find a prodigious difference in the powers of different men, in that re&s;pect, after they are grown up, becau&s;e their minds have been more or le&s;s exerci&s;ed in it; and I think the &s;ame cau&s;e will explain the difference of excellence in other things, gradations admitting always &s;ome difference in the fir&s;t principles."</Q></P>

<P>I again vi&s;ited him on Monday. He took occa&s;ion to enlarge, as he often did, upon the wretchedne&s;s of a &s;ea-life. <Q REND="inline">"A &s;hip is wor&s;e than a gaol.

<P>On Tue&s;day, March 19, which was fixed for our propo&s;ed jaunt, we met in the morning at the Somer&s;et coffee-hou&s;e in the Strand, where we were taken up by the Oxford coach. He was accompanied by Mr. Gwyn, the architect; and a gentleman of Merton College, whom we did not know, had the fourth &s;eat. We &s;oon got into conver&s;ation; for it was very remarkable of John&s;on, that the pre&s;ence of a &s;tranger was no re&s;traint upon his talk. I ob&s;erved that Garrick, who was about to quit the &s;tage, would &s;oon have an ea&s;ier life. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I doubt that, Sir."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, he will be Atlas with the burthen off his back."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But I know not, Sir, if he will be &s;o &s;teady without his load. However, he &s;hould never play any more, but be entirely the gentleman, and not partly the player: he &s;hould no longer &s;ubject him&s;elf to be hi&s;&s;ed by a mob, or to be in&s;olently treated by performers, whom he u&s;ed to rule with a high hand, and who would gladly retaliate."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I think he &s;hould play once <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> year for the benefit of decayed actors, as it has been &s;aid he means to do."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Alas, Sir! he will &s;oon be a decayed actor him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23" MS="y">
 John&s;on expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;approbation of ornamental architecture, &s;uch as mag|nificent columns &s;upporting a portico, or expen&s;ive pila&s;ters &s;upporting merely their own capitals, <Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e it con&s;umes labour di&s;proportionate to its utility."</Q> For the &s;ame rea&s;on he &s;atyri&s;ed &s;tatuary. <Q REND="inline">"Painting (&s;aid he,) con&s;umes labour not di&s;proportionate to its effect; but a fellow will hack half a year at a block of marble to make &s;omething in &s;tone that hardly re&s;embles a man. The value of &s;tatuary is owing to its difficulty. You would not value the fine&s;t head cut upon a carrot."</Q> Here he &s;eemed to me to be &s;trangely deficient in ta&s;te; for &s;urely &s;tatuary is a noble art of imitation, and pre&s;erves a wonderful expre&s;&s;ion of the varieties of the human frame; and although it mu&s;t be allowed that the circum&s;tances of difficulty enhances the value of a marble head, we &s;hould con&s;ider, that if it requires a long time in the performance, it has a proportionate value in durability.</P>
<P>Gwyn was a fine lively rattling fellow. Dr. John&s;on kept him in &s;ubjection, but with a kindly authority. The &s;pirit of the arti&s;t, however, ro&s;e again&s;t what he thought a Gothick attack, and he made a bri&s;k defence. <Q REND="inline">"What, Sir, will you allow no value to beauty in architecture or in &s;tatuary? Why &s;hould we allow it then in writing? Why do you take the trouble to give us &s;o many fine allu&s;ions, and bright images, and elegant phra&s;es? You might convey all your in&s;truction without the&s;e ornaments."</Q> John&s;on &s;miled with complacency; but &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, all the&s;e ornaments are u&s;eful, becau&s;e they obtain an ea&s;ier reception for truth; but a building is not at all more convenient for being decorated with &s;uperfluous carved work."</Q></P>
<P>Gwyn at la&s;t was lucky enough to make one reply to Dr. John&s;on, which he allowed to be excellent. John&s;on cen&s;ured him for taking down a church which might have &s;tood many years, and building a new one at a different place, for no other rea&s;on but that there might be a direct road to a new bridge; and his expre&s;&s;ion was, <Q REND="inline">"You are taking a church out of the way, that the people may go in a &s;traight line to the bridge."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir (&s;aid Gwyn) I am putting the church <HI>in</HI> the way, that the people may not <HI>go out of the way.</HI>"</Q> JOHNSON. (with a hearty loud laugh of approbation,) <Q REND="inline">"Speak no more. Re&s;t your colloquial fame upon this."</Q></P>
<P>Upon our arrival at Oxford, Dr. John&s;on and I went directly to Univer&s;ity College, but were di&s;appointed on finding that one of the fellows, his friend Mr. Scott, who accompanied him from Newca&s;tle to Edinburgh, was gone to the country. We put up at the Angel inn, and pa&s;&s;ed the evening by our&s;elves in ea&s;y and familiar conver&s;ation. Talking of con&s;titutional melancholy, he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"A man &s;o afflicted, Sir, mu&s;t divert di&s;tre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="23" REF="24">
thoughts, and not combat with them."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"May not he think them  down, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir. To attempt to <HI>think them down</HI> is madne&s;s. He &s;hould have a lamp con&s;tantly burning in his bed-chamber during the night, and if wakefully di&s;turbed, take a book, and read, and compo&s;e him&s;elf to re&s;t. To have the management of the mind is a great art, and it may be attained in a con&s;iderable degree by experience and habitual exerci&s;e."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Should not he provide amu&s;ements for him|&s;elf? Would it not, for in&s;tance, be right for him to take a cour&s;e of chymi&s;try?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Let him take a cour&s;e of chymi&s;try, or a cour&s;e of rope-dancing, or a cour&s;e of any thing to which he is inclined at the time. Let him contrive to have as many retreats for his mind as he can, as many things to which it can fly from it&s;elf. Burton's 'Anatomy of Melancholy' is a valuable work. It is, perhaps, overloaded with quotation. But there is great &s;pirit and great power in what Burton &s;ays, when he writes from his own mind."</Q></P>
<P>Next morning we vi&s;ited Dr. Wetherell, Ma&s;ter of Univer&s;ity College, with whom Dr. John&s;on conferred on the mo&s;t advantageous mode of di&s;po&s;ing of the books printed at the Clarendon pre&s;s, on which &s;ubject his letter has been in&s;erted in a former page. I often had occa&s;ion to remark, John&s;on loved bu&s;ine&s;s, loved to have his wi&s;dom actually operate on real life. Dr. Wetherell and I talked of him without re&s;erve in his own pre&s;ence. WETHERELL. <Q REND="inline">"I would have given him a hundred guineas if he would have written a preface to his 'Political Tracts,' by way of a Di&s;cour&s;e on the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Dr. John&s;on, though in his writings, and upon all occa&s;ions a great friend to the con&s;titution both in church and &s;tate, has never written expre&s;sly in &s;upport of either. There is really a claim upon him for both. I am &s;ure he could give a volume of no great bulk upon each, which would compri&s;e all the &s;ub&s;tance, and with his &s;pirit would effectually maintain them. He &s;hould erect a fort on the confines of each."</Q> I could perceive that he was di&s;plea&s;ed by this dialogue. He bur&s;t out, <Q REND="inline">"Why &s;hould <HI>I</HI> be always writing?"</Q> I hoped he was con&s;cious that the debt was ju&s;t, and meant to di&s;charge it, though he di&s;liked being dunned.</P>
<P>We then went to Pembroke College, and waited on his old friend Dr. Adams, the ma&s;ter of it, whom I found to be a mo&s;t polite, plea&s;ing, com|municative man. Before his advancement to the head&s;hip of his College, I had intended to go and vi&s;it him at Shrew&s;bury, where he was rector of St. Chad's, in order to get from him what particulars he could recollect of John&s;on's academical life. He now obligingly gave me part of that
<PB N="24" REF="25" MS="y">
 authentick information, which, with what I afterwards owed to his kindne&s;s, will be found incorporated in its proper place in this work.</P>
<P>Dr. Adams had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by an able an&s;wer to David Hume's <Q REND="inline">"E&s;&s;ay on Miracles."</Q> He told me he had once dined in company with Hume in London; that Hume &s;hook hands with him, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You have treated me much better than I de&s;erve;"</Q> and that they exchanged vi&s;its. I took the liberty to object to treating an infidel writer with &s;mooth civility. Where there is a controver&s;y concerning a pa&s;&s;age in a cla&s;&s;ick authour, or concerning a que&s;tion in antiquities, or any other &s;ubject in which human happine&s;s is not deeply intere&s;ted, a man may treat his antagoni&s;t with politene&s;s and even re&s;pect. But where the controver&s;y is concerning the truth of religion, it is of &s;uch va&s;t importance to him who maintains it, to obtain the victory, that the per&s;on of an opponent ought not to be &s;pared. If a man firmly believes that religion is an invaluable trea&s;ure, he will con&s;ider a writer who endeavours to deprive mankind of it as a <HI>robber;</HI> he will look upon him as <HI>odious,</HI> though the Infidel may think him&s;elf in the right. A robber who rea&s;ons as the gang do in the <Q REND="inline">"Beggar's Opera,"</Q> who call them&s;elves <HI>practical</HI> philo&s;ophers, and may have as much &s;incerity as pernicious <HI>&s;pecu|lative</HI> philo&s;ophers, is not the le&s;s an object of ju&s;t indignation. An aban|doned profligate may think that it is not wrong to debauch my wife; but &s;hall I, therefore, not dete&s;t him? And if I catch him making an attempt &s;hall I treat him with politene&s;s? No, I will kick him down &s;tairs, or run him through the body: that is, if I really love my wife, or have a true rational notion of honour. An Infidel then &s;hould not be treated hand&s;omely by a Chri&s;tian, merely becau&s;e he endeavours to rob with ingenuity. I do declare, however, that I am exceedingly unwilling to be provoked to anger, and could I be per&s;uaded that truth would not &s;uffer from a cool moderation in its defenders, I &s;hould wi&s;h to pre&s;erve good humour, at lea&s;t, in every controver&s;y; nor, indeed, do I &s;ee why a man &s;hould lo&s;e his temper while he does all he can to refute an opponent. I think ridicule may be fairly u&s;ed again&s;t an infidel; for in&s;tance, if he be an ugly fellow, and yet ab&s;urdly vain of his per&s;on, we may contra&s;t his appearance with Cicero's beautiful image of Virtue, could &s;he be &s;een. John&s;on coincided with me and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"When a man voluntarily engages in an important controver&s;y, he is to do all he can to le&s;&s;en his antagoni&s;t, becau&s;e authority from per&s;onal re&s;pect has much weight with mo&s;t people, and often more than rea&s;oning. If my antagoni&s;t writes bad language, though that may not be e&s;&s;ential to the que&s;tion; I will attack him for his bad language."</Q> ADAMS. <Q REND="inline">"You would

not jo&s;tle a chimney-&s;weeper."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, if it were nece&s;&s;ary  to jo&s;tle him <HI>down.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Adams told us, that in &s;ome of the Colleges at Oxford, the fellows had excluded the &s;tudents from &s;ocial intercour&s;e with them in the common room. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"They are in the right, Sir, for there can be no real conver&s;ation, no fair exertion of mind among&s;t them, if the young men are by; for a man who has a character does not choo&s;e to &s;take it in their pre&s;ence."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, may there not be very good conver&s;ation without a conte&s;t for &s;uperiority?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No animated conver&s;ation, Sir, for it cannot be but one or other will come off &s;uperiour. I do not mean that the victor mu&s;t have the better of the argument, for he may take the weak &s;ide; but his &s;uperiority of parts and knowledge will nece&s;&s;arily appear: and he to whom he thus &s;hews him&s;elf &s;uperiour is le&s;&s;ened in the eyes of the young men. You know it was &s;aid, <HI>'Mallem cum Scaligero errare quem cum Clavio rect&egrave; &s;apere.'</HI> In the &s;ame manner take Bentley's and Ja&s;on de Neres' Comments upon Horace, you will admire Bentley more when wrong, than Ja&s;on when right."</Q></P>
<P>We walked with Dr. Adams into the ma&s;ter's garden, and into the common room. JOHNSON. (after a reverie of meditation,) <Q REND="inline">"Aye! Here I u&s;ed to play at drafts with Phil. Jones and Fludyer. Jones loved beer, and did not get very forward in the church. Fludyer turned out a &s;coundrel, a Whig, and &s;aid he was a&s;hamed of having been bred at Oxford. He had a living at Putney, and got under the eye of &s;ome retainers to the court at that time, and &s;o became a violent Whig: but he had been a &s;coundrel all along, to be &s;ure."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Was he a &s;coundrel, Sir, in any other way than being a political &s;coundrel? Did he cheat at drafts?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, we never played for <HI>money.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>He then carried me to vi&s;it Dr. Bentham, Canon of Chri&s;t-Church, and Divinity Profe&s;&s;or, with who&s;e learned and lively conver&s;ation we were much plea&s;ed. He gave us an invitation to dinner, which Dr. John&s;on told me was a high honour. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is a great thing to dine with the Canons of Chri&s;t-Church."</Q> We could not accept his invitation, as we were engaged to dine at Univer&s;ity College. We had an excellent dinner there, with the Ma&s;ter and Fellows, it being St. Cuthbert's day, which is kept by them as a fe&s;tival, as he was a &s;aint of Durham, with which this College is much connected.</P>
<P>We drank tea with Dr. Horne, Pre&s;ident of Magdalen College, now Bi&s;hop of Norwich, of who&s;e abilities, in different re&s;pects, the publick has had
<PB N="26" REF="27">
 eminent proofs, and the e&s;teem annexed to who&s;e character was increa&s;ed by knowing him per&s;onally. He had talked of publi&s;hing an edition of Walton's Lives, but had laid a&s;ide that de&s;ign, upon Dr. John&s;on's telling him, from mi&s;take, that Lord Hailes intended to do it. I had wi&s;hed to negociate between Lord Hailes and him, that one or other &s;hould perform &s;o good a work. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"In order to do it well, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to collect all the editions of Walton's Lives. By way of adapting the book to the ta&s;te of the pre&s;ent age, they have, in a later edition, left out a vi&s;ion which he relates Dr. Donne had, but it &s;hould be re&s;tored; and there &s;hould be a critical catalogue given of the works of the different per&s;ons who&s;e lives were written by Walton, and therefore their works mu&s;t be carefully read by the editor."</Q></P>
<P>We then went to Trinity College, where he introduced me to Mr. Thomas Warton, with whom we pa&s;&s;ed a part of the evening. We talked of biography.&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It is rarely well executed. They only who live with a man can write his life with any genuine exactne&s;s and di&s;crimination; and few people who have lived with a man know what to remark about him. The chaplain of a late Bi&s;hop, whom I was to a&s;&s;i&s;t in writing &s;ome memoirs of his Lord&s;hip, could tell me almo&s;t nothing."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;aid, Mr. Robert Dod&s;ley's life &s;hould be written, as he had been &s;o much connected with the wits of his time, and by his literary merit had rai&s;ed him|&s;elf from the &s;tation of a footman. Mr. Warton &s;aid, he had publi&s;hed a little volume under the title of <Q REND="inline">"The Mu&s;e in Livery."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I doubt whether Dod&s;ley's brother would thank a man who &s;hould write his life: yet Dod&s;ley him&s;elf was not unwilling that his original low condition &s;hould be recollected. When Lord Lyttelton's 'Dialogues of the Dead' came out, one of which is between Apicius, an ancient epicure, and Darteneuf, a modern epicure, Dod&s;ley &s;aid to me, 'I knew Darteneuf well, for I was once his footman."</Q></P>
<P>Biography led us to &s;peak of Dr. John Campbell, who had written a con&s;ider|able part of the <Q REND="inline">"Biographia Britannica."</Q> John&s;on, though he valued him highly, was of opinion that there was not &s;o much in his great work, <Q REND="inline">"A Political Survey of Great-Britain,"</Q> as the world had been taught to expect; and had &s;aid to me, that he believed Campbell's di&s;appointment, on account of the bad &s;ucce&s;s of that work, had killed him. He this evening ob&s;erved of it, <Q REND="inline">"That work was his death."</Q> Mr. Warton, not adverting to his meaning, an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"I believe &s;o; from the great attention he be&s;towed on it."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, he died of <HI>want</HI> of attention, if he died at all by that book."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28" MS="y">
We talked of a work much in vogue at that time, written in a very melliflu|ous  &s;tyle, but which, under pretext of another &s;ubject, contained much artful infidelity. I &s;aid it was not fair to attack us thus unexpectedly; he &s;hould have warned us of our danger, before we entered his garden of flowery eloquence, by adverti&s;ing, <Q REND="inline">"Spring-guns and man-traps &s;et here."</Q> The authour had been an Oxonian, and was remembered there for having <Q REND="inline">"turned Papi&s;t."</Q> I ob&s;erved, that as he had changed &s;everal times&mdash;from the Church of England to the Church of Rome&mdash;from the Church of Rome to infidelity&mdash;I did not de&s;pair yet of &s;eeing him a methodi&s;t preacher. JOHNSON. (laughing,) <Q REND="inline">"It is &s;aid, that his range has been more exten&s;ive, and that he has once been Mahometan. However, now that he has publi&s;hed his infidelity, he will probably per&s;i&s;t in it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I am not quite &s;ure of that, Sir."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned Sir Richard Steele having publi&s;hed his <Q REND="inline">"Chri&s;tian Hero,"</Q> with the avowed purpo&s;e of obliging him&s;elf to lead a religious life; yet, that his conduct was by no means &s;trictly &s;uitable. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Steele, I believe, practi&s;ed the lighter vices."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Warton, being engaged, could not &s;up with us at our inn; we had therefore another evening by our&s;elves. I a&s;ked John&s;on, whether a man's being forward in making him&s;elf known to eminent people, and &s;eeing as much of life, and getting as much information as he could in every way, was not yet le&s;&s;ening him&s;elf by his forwardne&s;s. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; a man always makes him&s;elf greater, as he increa&s;es his knowledge."</Q></P>
<P>I cen&s;ured &s;ome ludicrous fanta&s;tick dialogues between two coach-hor&s;es, and other &s;uch &s;tuff, which Baretti had lately publi&s;hed. He joined with me, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Nothing odd will do long. 'Tri&s;tram Shandy' did not la&s;t."</Q> I expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to be acquainted with a lady who had been much talked of, and univer&s;ally celebrated for extraordinary addre&s;s and in&s;inuation. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Never believe extraordinary characters which you hear of people. Depend upon it, Sir, they are exaggerated. You do not &s;ee one man &s;hoot a great deal higher than another."</Q> I mentioned Mr. Burke. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes; Burke <HI>is</HI> an extraordinary man. His &s;tream of mind is perpetual."</Q> It is very plea&s;ing to me to record, that John&s;on's high e&s;timation of the talents of this gentleman was uniform from their early acquaintance. Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds informs me, that when Mr. Burke was fir&s;t elected a member of parliament, and Sir John Hawkins expre&s;&s;ed a wonder at his attaining a &s;eat, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Now we who know Burke, know, that he will be one of the fir&s;t men in this country."</Q> And once, when John&s;on was ill, and unable to exert him&s;elf as
<PB N="28" REF="29">
 much as u&s;ual without fatigue, Mr. Burke having been mentioned, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"That fellow calls forth all my powers. Were I to &s;ee Burke now, it would kill me."</Q> So much was he accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider conver&s;ation as a conte&s;t&punc; and &s;uch was his notion of Burke as an opponent.</P>
<P>Next morning, Thur&s;day, March 21, we &s;et out in a po&s;t-chai&s;e to pur&s;ue our ramble. It was a delightful day, and we drove through Blenheim Park. When I looked at the magnificent bridge built by John Duke of Marlborough, over a &s;mall rivulet, and recollected the Epigram made upon it&mdash;
<Q><L>"The lofty arch his high ambition &s;hows,</L>
<L>"The &s;tream, an emblem of his bounty flows."</L></Q>
and &s;aw that now, by the genius of Brown, a magnificent body of water was collected, I &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"They have <HI>drowned</HI> the Epigram."</Q> I ob&s;erved to him, while in the mid&s;t of the noble &s;cene around us, <Q REND="inline">"You and I, Sir, have, I think, &s;een together the extremes of what can be &s;een in Britain;&mdash;the wild rough i&s;land of Mull, and Blenheim Park."</Q></P>
<P>We dined at an excellent inn at Chapel-hou&s;e, where he expatiated on the felicity of England in its taverns and inns, and triumphed over the French for not having, in any perfection, the tavern life. <Q REND="inline">"There is no private hou&s;e (&s;aid he,) in which people can enjoy them&s;elves &s;o well, as at a capital tavern. Let there be ever &s;o great plenty of good things, ever &s;o much grandeur, ever &s;o much elegance, ever &s;o much de&s;ire that every body &s;hould be ea&s;y; in the nature of things it cannot be: there mu&s;t always be &s;ome degree of care and anxiety. The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e is anxious to entertain his gue&s;ts; the gue&s;ts are anxious to be agreeable to him: and no man, but a very impudent dog indeed, can as freely command what is in another man's hou&s;e, as if it were his own. Whereas, at a tavern, there is a general freedom from anxiety. You are &s;ure you are welcome: and the more noi&s;e you make, the more trouble you give, the more good things you call for, the welcomer you are. No &s;ervants will attend you with the alacrity which waiters do, who are incited by the pro&s;pect of an immediate reward, in proportion as they plea&s;e. No, Sir; there is nothing which has yet been contrived by man, by which &s;o much happine&s;s is produced as by a good tavern or inn."</Q> He then repeated, with great emotion, Shen&s;tone's lines:</P>
<Q><LG>
<PB N="29" REF="30" MS="y">
<L>"Whoe'er has travell'd life's dull round, </L>
<L>"Where'er his &s;tages may have been,</L>
<L>"May &s;igh to think he &s;till has found</L>
<L>"The warme&s;t welcome at an inn <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">We happened to lye this night at the inn at Henley, where Shen&s;tone wrote the&s;e lines.</NOTE>."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>In the afternoon, as we were driven rapidly along in the po&s;t-chai&s;e, he &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"Life has not many things better than this."</Q></P>
<P>We &s;topped at Stratford-upon-Avon, and drank tea and coffee; and it plea&s;ed me to be with him upon the cla&s;&s;ick ground of Shak&s;peare's native place.</P>
<P>He &s;poke &s;lightingly of Dyer's <Q REND="inline">"Fleece."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The &s;ubject, Sir, cannot be made poetical. How can a man write poetically of &s;erges and druggets? Yet you will hear many people talk to you gravely of that <HI>excellent</HI> poem, THE FLEECE."</Q> Having talked of Dr. Grainger's <Q REND="inline">"Sugar-Cane,"</Q> I men|tioned to him Mr. Langton's having told me, that this poem, when read in manu&s;cript at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's, had made all the a&s;&s;embled wits bur&s;t into a laugh, when, after much blank-ver&s;e pomp, the poet began a new paragraph thus:
<Q><L>"Now, Mu&s;e, let's &s;ing of <HI>rats."</HI></L></Q>
And what increa&s;ed the ridicule was, that one of the company, who &s;lily over|looked the reader, perceived that the word had been originally <HI>mice,</HI> and had been altered to <HI>rats,</HI> as more dignified <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>Such is this little laughable incident, which has been often related. Dr. Percy, the Bi&s;hop of Dromore, who was an intimate friend of Dr. Grainger, and has a particular regard for his memory, has communicated to me the following explanation:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The pa&s;&s;age in que&s;tion was originally not liable to &s;uch a perver&s;ion; for the authour having occa&s;ion in that part of his work to mention the havock made by rats and mice, had introduced the &s;ubject in a kind of mock heroick, and a parody of Homer's battle of the frogs and mice, invoking the Mu&s;e of the old Grecian bard in an elegant and well-turned manner. In that &s;tate I had &s;een it; but afterwards, unknown to me and other friends, he had been per&s;uaded, contrary to his own better judgement, to alter it, &s;o as to produce the unlucky effect above mentioned."</Q></P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop gives this character of Dr. Grainger:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He was not only a man of genius and learning, but had many excellent virtues; being one of the mo&s;t generous, friendly, and benevo|lent men I ever knew."</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>John&s;on &s;aid, that Dr. Grainger was an agreeable man; a man who would do any good that was in his power. His tran&s;lation of Tibullus, he thought, was very well done; but <Q REND="inline">"The Sugar-Cane, a Poem,"</Q> did not plea&s;e him;
<PB N="30" REF="31" MS="y">
 for, he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"What could he make of a &s;ugar-cane? One might as well write, 'The Par&s;ley-Bed, a Poem;' or, 'The Cabbage-Garden, a Poem."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t then <HI>pickle</HI> your cabbage with the <HI>&s;al atticum.</HI>"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"You know there is already 'The Hop-Garden, a Poem:' and, I think, one could &s;ay a great deal about cabbage. The poem might begin with the advantages of civili&s;ed &s;ociety over a rude &s;tate, exemplified by the Scotch, who had no cabbages till Oliver Cromwell's &s;oldiers introduced them; and one might thus &s;hew how arts are propagated by conque&s;t, as they were by the Roman arms."</Q> He &s;eemed to be much diverted with the fertility of his own fancy.</P>
<P>I told him, that I heard Dr. Percy was writing the hi&s;tory of the wolf in Great-Britain. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"The wolf, Sir! why the wolf? Why does he not write of the bear, which we had formerly? Nay, it is &s;aid we had the beaver. Or why does he not write of the grey rat, the Hanover rat, as it is called, becau&s;e it is &s;aid to have come into this country about the time that the family of Hanover came? I &s;hould like to &s;ee <HI>'The Hi&s;tory of the Grey Rat, by Thomas Percy, D. D. Chaplain in Ordinary to his Maje&s;ty,</HI>"</Q> (laughing immoderately). BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I am afraid a court chaplain could not decently write of the grey rat."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he need not give it the name of the Hanover rat."</Q> Thus could he indulge a luxuriant &s;portive imagination, when talking of a friend whom he loved and e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>He mentioned to me the &s;ingular hi&s;tory of an ingenious acquaintance. <Q REND="inline">"He &s;ettled as a phy&s;ician in one of the Leeward I&s;lands. A man was &s;ent out to him merely to compound his medicines. This fellow &s;et up as a rival to him in his practice of phy&s;ick, and got &s;o much the better of him in the opinion of the people of the i&s;land, that he carried away all the bu&s;ine&s;s; upon which he returned to England, and &s;oon after died."</Q></P>
<P>On Friday, March 22, having &s;et out early from Henley, where we had lain the preceding night, we arrived at Birmingham about nine o'clock, and, after breakfa&s;t, went to call on his old &s;choolfellow Mr. Hector. A very &s;tupid maid, who opened the door, told us, that <Q REND="inline">"her ma&s;ter was gone out; he was gone to the country; &s;he could not tell when he would return."</Q> In &s;hort, &s;he gave us a mi&s;erable reception; and John&s;on ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"She would have behaved no better to people who wanted him in the way of his profe&s;|&s;ion."</Q> He &s;aid to her, <Q REND="inline">"My name is John&s;on; tell him I called. Will you remember the name?"</Q> She an&s;wered with ru&s;tick &s;implicity, in the War|wick&s;hire pronunciation, <Q REND="inline">"I don't under&s;tand you, Sir."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Blockhead, (&s;aid he,) I'll write."</Q> I never heard the word <HI>blockhead</HI> applied to a woman before,
<PB N="31" REF="32">
though I do not &s;ee why it &s;hould not, when there is evident occa&s;ion for it.  He, however, made another attempt to make her under&s;tand him, and roared loud in her ear, <Q REND="inline">"JOHNSON,"</Q> and then &s;he catched the &s;ound.</P>
<P>We then called on Mr. Lloyd, one of the people called Quakers. He too was not at home; but Mrs. Lloyd was, and received us courteou&s;ly, and a&s;ked us to dinner. John&s;on &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"After the uncertainty of all human things at Hector's, this invitation came very well."</Q> We walked about the town, and he was plea&s;ed to &s;ee it increa&s;ing.</P>
<P>I talked of legitimation by &s;ub&s;equent marriage, which obtained in the Roman law, and &s;till obtains in the law of Scotland. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I think it a bad thing; becau&s;e the cha&s;tity of women being of the utmo&s;t importance, as all property depends upon it, they who forfeit it &s;hould not have any po&s;&s;i|bility of being re&s;tored to good character; nor &s;hould the children, by an illicit connection, attain the full rights of lawful children, by the po&s;teriour con&s;ent of the offending parties."</Q> His opinion upon this &s;ubject de&s;erves con&s;ideration. Upon his principle there may, at times, be a hard&s;hip, and &s;eemingly a &s;trange one, upon individuals; but the general good of &s;ociety is better &s;ecured. And, after all, it is unrea&s;onable in an individual to repine that he has not the advantage of a &s;tate which is made different from his own, by the &s;ocial in&s;titution under which he is born. A woman does not complain that her brother, who is younger than her, gets their common father's e&s;tate. Why then &s;hould a natural &s;on complain that a younger brother, by the &s;ame parents lawfully begotten, gets it? The operation of law is &s;imilar in both ca&s;es. Be&s;ides; an illegitimate &s;on, who has a younger legitimate brother by the &s;ame father and mother, has no &s;tronger claim to the father's e&s;tate, than if that legitimate brother had only the &s;ame father, from whom alone the e&s;tate de&s;cends.</P>
<P>Mr. Lloyd joined us in the &s;treet; and in a little while we met <HI>Friend Hector,</HI> as Mr. Lloyd called him. It gave me plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve the joy which John&s;on and he expre&s;&s;ed on &s;eeing each other again. Mr. Lloyd and I left them together, while he obligingly &s;hewed me &s;ome of the manufactures of this very curious a&s;&s;emblage of artificers. We all met at dinner at Mr. Lloyd's, where we were entertained with great ho&s;pitality. Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd had been married the &s;ame year with their Maje&s;ties, and, like them, had been ble&s;&s;ed with a numerous family of fine children, their numbers being exactly the &s;ame. John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Marriage is the be&s;t &s;tate for man in general; and every man is a wor&s;e man, in proportion as he is unfit for the married &s;tate."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33" MS="y">
 I have always loved the &s;implicity of manners, and the &s;piritual-mindedne&s;s of the Quakers; and talking with Mr. Lloyd, I ob&s;erved, that the e&s;&s;ential part of religion was piety, a devout intercour&s;e with the Divinity; and that many a man was a Quaker without knowing it.</P>
<P>As Dr. John&s;on had &s;aid to me in the morning, while we walked together, that he liked individuals among the Quakers, but not the &s;ect; when we were at Mr. Lloyd's I kept clear of introducing any que&s;tion concerning the pecu|liarities of their faith. But I having a&s;ked to look at Ba&s;kerville's edition of <Q REND="inline">"Barclay's Apology,"</Q> John&s;on laid hold of it; and the chapter on bapti&s;m happening to open, John&s;on remarked, <Q REND="inline">"He &s;ays there is neither precept nor practice for bapti&s;m, in the &s;criptures; that is fal&s;e."</Q> Here he was the aggre&s;&s;or, by no means in a gentle manner; and the good Quakers had the advantage of him; for he had read negligently, and had not ob&s;erved that Barclay &s;peaks of <HI>infant</HI> bapti&s;m, which they calmly made him perceive. Mr. Lloyd, how|ever, was in as great a mi&s;take; for when in&s;i&s;ting that the rite of bapti&s;m with water was to cea&s;e, when the <HI>&s;piritual</HI> admini&s;tration of CHRIST began, he maintained, that John the Bapti&s;t &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>My bapti&s;m</HI> &s;hall decrea&s;e, but <HI>his</HI> &s;hall increa&s;e."</Q> Whereas the words are, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>He</HI> mu&s;t increa&s;e, but <HI>I</HI> mu&s;t decrea&s;e <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">John iii. 30.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>One of them having objected to the <Q REND="inline">"ob&s;ervance of days, and months, and years,"</Q> John&s;on an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"The Church does not &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly ob&s;erve days, merely as days, but as memorials of important facts. Chri&s;tmas might be kept as well upon one day of the year as another: but there &s;hould be a &s;tated day for commemorating the birth of our Saviour, becau&s;e there is danger that what may be done on any day, will be neglected."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Hector was &s;o good as to accompany me to &s;ee the great works of Mr. Bolton, at a place which he has called Soho, about two miles from Birmingham, which the very ingenious proprietor &s;hewed me him&s;elf to the be&s;t advantage. I wi&s;h that John&s;on had been with us; for it was a &s;cene which I &s;hould have been glad to contemplate by his light. The va&s;tne&s;s and the contrivance of &s;ome of the machinery would have <Q REND="inline">"matched his mighty mind."</Q> I &s;hall never forget Mr. Bolton's expre&s;&s;ion to me: <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ell here, Sir, what all the world de&s;ires to have,&mdash;Power."</Q> He had about &s;even hun|dred people at work. I contemplated him as an <HI>iron chieftain,</HI> and he &s;eemed to be a father to his tribe. One of them came to him, complaining grievou&s;ly of his landlord for having di&s;trained his goods. <Q REND="inline">"Your landlord is in the
<PB N="33" REF="34">
right, Smith, (&s;aid Bolton). But I'll tell you what: find you a friend who  will lay down one half of your rent, and I'll lay down the other half; and you &s;hall have your goods again."</Q></P>
<P>From Mr. Hector I now learnt many particulars of Dr. John&s;on's early life, which, with others that he gave me at different times &s;ince, have contributed to the formation of this work.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on &s;aid to me in the morning, <Q REND="inline">"You will &s;ee, Sir, at Mr. Hector's, his &s;i&s;ter, Mrs. Carele&s;s, a clergyman's widow. She was the fir&s;t woman with whom I was in love. It dropt out of my head imperceptibly; but &s;he and I &s;hall always have a kindne&s;s for each other."</Q> He laughed at the notion that a man never can be really in love but once, and con&s;idered it as a mere romantick fancy.</P>
<P>On our return from Mr. Bolton's, Mr. Hector took me to his hou&s;e, where we found John&s;on &s;itting placidly at tea, with his <HI>fir&s;t love;</HI> who, though now advanced in years, was a genteel woman, very agreeable, and well-bred.</P>
<P>John&s;on lamented to Mr. Hector the &s;tate of one of their &s;chool-fellows, Mr. Charles Congreve, a clergyman, which he thus de&s;cribed: <Q REND="inline">"He obtained, I believe, con&s;iderable preferment in Ireland, but now lives in London, quite as a valetudinarian, afraid to go into any hou&s;e but his own. He takes a &s;hort airing in his po&s;t-chai&s;e every day. He has an elderly woman, whom he calls cou&s;in, who lives with him, and jogs his elbow, when his gla&s;s has &s;tood too long empty, and encourages him in drinking, in which he is very willing to be encouraged; not that he gets drunk, for he is a very pious man, but he is always muddy. He confe&s;&s;es to one bottle of port every day, and he probably drinks more. He is quite un&s;ocial; his conver&s;ation is mono|&s;yllabical: and when, at my la&s;t vi&s;it, I a&s;ked him what a clock it was, that &s;ignal of my departure had &s;o plea&s;ing an effect on him, that he &s;prung up to look at his watch, like a greyhound bounding at a hare."</Q> When John&s;on took leave of Mr. Hector, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Don't grow like Congreve; nor let me grow like him, when you are near me."</Q></P>
<P>When he again talked of Mrs. Carele&s;s to-night, he &s;eemed to have had his affection revived; for he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If I had married her, it might have been as happy for me."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, do you not &s;uppo&s;e that there are fifty women in the world, with any one of whom a man may be as happy, as with any one woman in particular."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Aye, fifty thou&s;and."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, you are not of opinion with &s;ome who imagine that certain men and certain women are made for each other; and that they can|not
<PB N="34" REF="35" MS="y">
 be happy if they mi&s;s their counterparts."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure not, Sir. I believe marriages would in general be as happy, and often more &s;o, if they were all made by the Lord Chancellor, upon a due con&s;ideration of characters and circum&s;tances, without the parties having any choice in the matter."</Q></P>
<P>I wi&s;hed to have &s;taid at Birmingham to-night, to have talked more with Mr. Hector; but my friend was impatient to reach his native city: &s;o we drove on that &s;tage in the dark, and were long pen&s;ive and &s;ilent. When we came within the focus of the Lichfield lamps, <Q REND="inline">"Now (&s;aid he,) we are getting out of a &s;tate of death."</Q> We put up at the Three Crowns, not one of the great inns, but a good old fa&s;hioned one, which was kept by Mr. Wilkins, and was the very next hou&s;e to that in which John&s;on was born and brought up, and which was &s;till his own property <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">I went through the hou&s;e where my illu&s;trious friend was born, with a reverence with which it doubtle&s;s will long be vi&s;ited. An engraved view of it, with the adjacent buildings, is in <Q REND="inline">"The Gentleman's Magazine"</Q> for February, 1785.</NOTE>. We had a comfortable &s;upper, and got into high &s;pirits. I felt all my Toryi&s;m glow in this old capital of Stafford|&s;hire. I could have offered incen&s;e <HI>genio loci;</HI> and I indulged in libations of that ale, which Bonniface, in <Q REND="inline">"The Beaux Stratagem,"</Q> recommends with &s;uch an eloquent jollity.</P>
<P>Next morning he introduced me to Mrs. Lucy Porter, his &s;tep-daughter&punc; She was now an old maid, with much &s;implicity of manner. She had never been in London. Her brother, a Captain in the navy, had left her a fortune of ten thou&s;and pounds; about a third of which &s;he had laid out in building a &s;tately hou&s;e, and making a hand&s;ome garden, in an elevated &s;ituation in Lichfield. John&s;on, when here by him&s;elf, u&s;ed to live at her hou&s;e. She reverenced him, and he had a parental tenderne&s;s for her.</P>
<P>We then vi&s;ited Mr. Peter Garrick, who had that morning received a letter from his brother David, announcing our coming to Lichfield. He was engaged to dinner, but a&s;ked us to tea, and to &s;leep at his hou&s;e. John&s;on, however, would not quit his old acquaintance Wilkins, of the Three Crowns. The family likene&s;s of the Garricks was very &s;triking; and John&s;on thought that David's vivacity was not &s;o peculiar to him&s;elf as was &s;uppo&s;ed. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) I don't know but if Peter had cultivated all the arts of gaiety as much as David has done, he might have been as bri&s;k and lively. Depend upon it, Sir, vivacity is much an art, and depends greatly on habit."</Q> I believe there is a good deal of truth in this, notwith&s;tanding a ludicrous &s;tory told me by a lady abroad, of a heavy German baron, who had lived
<PB N="35" REF="36" MS="y">
much with the young Engli&s;h at Geneva, and was ambitious to be as lively as  they; with which view, he, with a&s;&s;iduous exertion, was jumping over the tables and chairs in his lodgings; and when the people of the hou&s;e ran in and a&s;ked, with &s;urprize, what was the matter, he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Sh' apprens t'etre fif."</Q></P>
<P>We dined at our inn, and had with us a Mr. Jack&s;on, one of John&s;on's &s;choolfellows, whom he treated with much kindne&s;s, though he &s;eemed to be a low man, dull and untaught. He had a coar&s;e grey coat, black wai&s;tcoat, grea&s;y leather breeches, and a yellow uncurled wig; and his coun|tenance had the ruddine&s;s which betokens one who is in no ha&s;te to <Q REND="inline">"leave his can."</Q> He drank only ale. He had tried to be a cutler at Birmingham, but had not &s;ucceeded; and now he lived poorly at home, and had &s;ome &s;cheme of dre&s;&s;ing leather in a better manner than common; to his indi&s;tinct account of which, Dr. John&s;on li&s;tened with patient attention, that he might a&s;&s;i&s;t him with his advice. Here was an in&s;tance of genuine humanity and real kindne&s;s in this great man, who has been mo&s;t unju&s;tly repre&s;ented as altogether har&s;h and de&s;titute of tenderne&s;s. A thou&s;and &s;uch in&s;tances might have been recorded in the cour&s;e of his long life; though, that his temper was warm and ha&s;ty, and his manner often rough, cannot be denied.</P>
<P>I &s;aw here, for the fir&s;t time, <HI>oat ale;</HI> and oat cakes not hard as in Scot|land, but &s;oft like a York&s;hire cake, were &s;erved at breakfa&s;t. It was plea&s;ant to me to find, that <Q REND="inline">"Oats,"</Q> the <Q REND="inline">"food of hor&s;es,"</Q> were &s;o much u&s;ed as the <HI>food of the people</HI> in Dr. John&s;on's own town. He expatiated in prai&s;e of Lich|field and its inhabitants, who, he &s;aid, were <Q REND="inline">"the mo&s;t &s;ober, decent people in England, the genteele&s;t in proportion to their wealth, and &s;poke the pure&s;t Engli&s;h."</Q> I doubted as to the la&s;t article of this eulogy; for they had &s;everal provincial &s;ounds; as, <HI>there,</HI> pronounced like <HI>fear,</HI> in&s;tead of like <HI>fair; once,</HI> pronounced <HI>woon&s;e,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>wun&s;e,</HI> or <HI>won&s;e.</HI> John&s;on him&s;elf never got entirely free of his provincial accent. Garrick &s;ometimes u&s;ed to take him off, &s;queezing a lemon into a punch-bowl, with uncouth ge&s;ticulations, looking round the company, and calling out, <Q REND="inline">"Who's for <HI>poon&s;h?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Very little bu&s;ine&s;s appeared to be going forward in Lichfield. I found however two &s;trange manufactures for &s;o inland a place, &s;ail-cloth and &s;treamers for &s;hips; and I ob&s;erved them making &s;ome &s;addle-cloths, and dre&s;&s;ing &s;heep&s;kins: but upon the whole, the bu&s;y hand of indu&s;try &s;eemed to be quite &s;lackened. <Q REND="inline">"Surely, Sir, (&s;aid I,) you are an idle &s;et of people."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) we are a city of philo&s;ophers: we work with our heads, and make the boobies of Birmingham work for us with their hands."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37" MS="y">
 There was at this time a company of players performing at Lichfield. The manager, Mr. Stanton, &s;ent his compliments, and reque&s;ted leave to wait on Dr. John&s;on. John&s;on received him very courteou&s;ly, and he drank a gla&s;s of wine with us. He was a plain decent well-behaved man, and expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude to Dr. John&s;on for having once got him permi&s;&s;ion from Dr. Taylor at A&s;hbourne to play there upon moderate terms. Garrick's name was &s;oon introduced. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Garrick's conver&s;ation is gay and grote&s;que. It is a di&s;h of all &s;orts, but all good things. There is no &s;olid meat in it: there is a want of &s;entiment in it. Not but that he has &s;enti|ment &s;ometimes, and &s;entiment too very powerful and very plea&s;ing: but it has not its full proportion in his conver&s;ation."</Q></P>
<P>When we were by our&s;elves he told me, <Q REND="inline">"Forty years ago, Sir, I was in love with an actre&s;s here, Mrs. Emmet, who acted Flora, in 'Hob in the Well."</Q> What merit this lady had as an actre&s;s, or what was her figure, or her manner, I have not been informed: but, if we may believe Mr. Garrick, his old ma&s;ter's ta&s;te in theatrical merit was by no means refined; he was not an <HI>elegans formarum &s;pectator.</HI> Garrick u&s;ed to tell, that John&s;on &s;aid of an actor, who played Sir Harry Wildair at Lichfield, <Q REND="inline">"There is a courtly vivacity about the fellow;"</Q> when in fact, according to Garrick's account, <Q REND="inline">"he was the mo&s;t vulgar ruffian that ever went upon boards."</Q></P>
<P>We had promi&s;ed Mr. Stanton to be at his theatre on Monday. Dr. John&s;on jocularly propo&s;ed me to write a Prologue for the occa&s;ion: <Q REND="inline">"A Prologue, by James Bo&s;well, E&s;q. from the Hebrides."</Q> I was really inclined to take the hint. Methought, <Q REND="inline">"Prologue, &s;poken before Dr. Samuel John&s;on, at Lichfield, 1776;"</Q> would have &s;ounded as well as, <Q REND="inline">"Prologue, &s;poken before the Duke of York, at Oxford,"</Q> in Charles the Second's time. Much might have been &s;aid of what Lichfield had done for Shak&s;peare, by producing John&s;on and Garrick. But I found he was aver&s;e to it.</P>
<P>We went and viewed the mu&s;eum of Mr. Richard Green, apothecary here, who told me he was proud of being a relation of Dr. John&s;on's. It was, truly, a wonderful collection, both of antiquities and natural curio&s;ities, and ingenious works of art. He had all the articles accurately arranged, with their names upon labels, printed at his own little pre&s;s; and on the &s;tairca&s;e leading to it was a board, with the names of contributors marked in gold letters. A printed catalogue of the collection was to be had at a book|&s;eller's. John&s;on expre&s;&s;ed his admiration of the activity and diligence and good fortune of Mr. Green, in getting together, in his &s;ituation, &s;o great a variety of things; and Mr. Green told me, that John&s;on once &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"Sir,
<PB N="37" REF="38" MS="y">
I &s;hould as &s;oon have thought of building a man of war, as of collecting  &s;uch a mu&s;eum."</Q> Mr. Green's obliging alacrity in &s;hewing it was very plea&s;ing. His engraved portrait, with which he has favoured me, has a motto truly characteri&s;tical of his di&s;po&s;ition, <Q REND="inline">"Nemo &s;ibi vivat."</Q></P>
<P>A phy&s;ician being mentioned who had lo&s;t his practice, becau&s;e his whim&s;i|cally changing his religion had made people di&s;tru&s;tful of him, I maintained that this was unrea&s;onable, as religion is unconnected with medical &s;kill. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is not unrea&s;onable; for when people &s;ee a man ab&s;urd in what they under&s;tand, they may conclude the &s;ame of him in what they do not under&s;tand. If a phy&s;ician were to take to eating of hor&s;e-fle&s;h, nobody would employ him; though one may eat hor&s;e-fle&s;h, and be a very &s;kilful phy&s;ician. If a man were educated in an ab&s;urd religion, his continuing to profe&s;s it would not hurt him, though his changing to it would."</Q></P>
<P>We drank tea and coffee at Mr. Peter Garrick's, where was Mrs. A&s;ton, one of the maiden &s;i&s;ters of Mrs. Walm&s;ley, wife of John&s;on's fir&s;t friend, and &s;i&s;ter al&s;o of the lady of whom John&s;on u&s;ed to &s;peak with the warme&s;t admi|ration, by the name of Molly A&s;ton, who was afterwards married to Captain Brodie of the navy.</P>
<P>On Sunday, March 24, we breakfa&s;ted with Mrs. Cobb, a widow lady, who lived in an agreeable &s;eque&s;tered place clo&s;e by the town, called the Friary, it having been formerly a religious hou&s;e. She and her niece, Mi&s;s Adey, were great admirers of Dr. John&s;on; and he behaved to them with a kindne&s;s and ea&s;y plea&s;antry, &s;uch as we &s;ee between old and intimate acquaintance. He accompanied Mrs. Cobb to St. Mary's church, and I went to the cathe|dral, where I was very much delighted with the mu&s;ick, finding it to be peculiarly &s;olemn, and accordant with the words of the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>We dined at Mr. Peter Garrick's, who was in a very lively humour, and verified John&s;on's &s;aying, that if he had cultivated gaiety as much as his brother David, he might have equally excelled in it. He was to-day quite a London narrator, telling us a variety of anecdotes with that earne&s;tne&s;s and attempt at mimickry which we u&s;ually find in the wits of the metropolis. Dr. John&s;on went with me to the cathedral in the afternoon. It was grand and plea&s;ing to contemplate this illu&s;trious writer, now full of fame, wor&s;hipping in <Q REND="inline">"the &s;olemn temple"</Q> of his native city.</P>
<P>I returned to tea and coffee at Mr. Peter Garrick's, and then found Dr. John&s;on at the Reverend Mr. Seward's, Canon Re&s;identiary, who inhabited the Bi&s;hop's palace, in which Mr. Walm&s;ley lived, and which had been the &s;cene of many happy hours in John&s;on's early life. Mr. Seward had, with
<PB N="38" REF="39" MS="y">
 eccle&s;ia&s;tical ho&s;pitality and politene&s;s, a&s;ked me in the morning, merely as a &s;tranger, to dine with him; and in the afternoon, when I was introduced to him, he a&s;ked Dr. John&s;on and me to &s;pend the evening and &s;up with him. He was a genteel well-bred dignified clergyman, had travelled with Lord Charles Fitzroy, uncle of the pre&s;ent Duke of Grafton, who died when abroad, and he had lived much in the great world. He was an ingenious and literary man, had publi&s;hed an edition of Beaumont and Fletcher, and written ver&s;es in Dod&s;ley's collection. His lady was the daughter of Mr. Hunter, John&s;on's fir&s;t &s;choolma&s;ter. And now, for the fir&s;t time, I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his celebrated daughter, Mi&s;s Anna Seward, to whom I have &s;ince been indebted for many civilities, as well as &s;ome obliging communications con|cerning John&s;on.</P>
<P>Mr. Seward mentioned to us the ob&s;ervations which he had made upon the &s;trata of earth in volcanos, from which it appeared, that they were &s;o very different in depth in different periods, that no calculation whatever could be made as to the time required for their formation. This fully refuted an anti|mo&s;aical remark introduced into Captain Brydone's entertaining Tour, I hope heedle&s;sly, from a kind of vanity which is too common in tho&s;e who have not &s;ufficiently &s;tudied the mo&s;t important of all &s;ubjects. Dr. John&s;on, indeed, had &s;aid before, independent of this ob&s;ervation, <Q REND="inline">"Shall all the accumulated evidence of the hi&s;tory of the world;&mdash;&s;hall the authority of what is unque&s;|tionably the mo&s;t ancient writing, be overturned by an uncertain remark &s;uch as this?"</Q></P>
<P>On Monday, March 25, we breakfa&s;ted at Mrs. Lucy Porter's. He had &s;ent an expre&s;s to Dr. Taylor's, acquainting him of our being at Lichfield, and Taylor had returned an an&s;wer that his po&s;t-chai&s;e &s;hould come for us this day. While we &s;at at breakfa&s;t, Dr. John&s;on received a letter by the po&s;t, which &s;eemed to agitate him very much. When he had read it, he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"One of the mo&s;t dreadful things that has happened in my time."</Q> The phra&s;e <HI>my time,</HI> like the word <HI>age,</HI> is u&s;ually under&s;tood to refer to an event of a publick or general nature. I imagined &s;omething like an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the King&mdash;like a gunpowder plot carried into execution&mdash;or like another fire of London. When a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"What is it, Sir?"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Thrale has lo&s;t his only &s;on!"</Q> This was, no doubt, a very great affliction to Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, which their friends would con&s;ider accordingly; but from the manner in which the intelligence of it was communicated by John&s;on, it appeared for the moment to be comparatively &s;mall. I however, &s;oon felt a &s;incere concern, and was curious to ob&s;erve how Dr. John&s;on would
<PB N="39" REF="40" MS="y">
be affected. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"This is a total extinction to their family, as much as  if they were &s;old into captivity."</Q> Upon my mentioning that Mr. Thrale had daughters, who might inherit his wealth;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Daughters, (&s;aid John&s;on, warmly,) he'll no more value his daughters than&mdash;"</Q> I was going to &s;peak.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) don't you know how you your&s;elf think? Sir, he wi&s;hes to propagate his name."</Q> In &s;hort, I &s;aw male &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;trong in his mind, even where there was no name, no family of any long &s;tanding. I &s;aid, it was lucky he was not pre&s;ent when this misfortune happened. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It is lucky for <HI>me.</HI> People in di&s;tre&s;s never think that you feel enough."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"And, Sir, they will have the hope of &s;eeing you, which will be a relief in the mean time; and when you get to them, the pain will be &s;o far abated, that they will be capable of being con&s;oled by you, which, in the fir&s;t violence of it, I believe, would not be the ca&s;e."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; violent pain of mind, as violent pain of body, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;everely felt."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I own, Sir, I have not &s;o much feeling for the di&s;tre&s;s of others, as &s;ome people have, or pretend to have: but I know this, that I would do all in my power to relieve them."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is affectation to pre|tend to feel the di&s;tre&s;s of others, as much as they do them&s;elves. It is equally &s;o, as if one &s;hould pretend to feel as much pain while a friend's leg is cutting off, as he does. No, Sir; you have expre&s;&s;ed the rational and ju&s;t nature of &s;ympathy. I would have gone to the extremity of the earth to have pre&s;erved this boy."</Q></P>
<P>He was &s;oon quite calm. The letter was from Mr. Thrale's clerk, and concluded, <Q REND="inline">"I need not &s;ay how much they wi&s;h to &s;ee you in London."</Q> He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"We &s;hall ha&s;ten back from Taylor's."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Lucy Porter and &s;ome other ladies of the place talked a great deal of him when he was out of the room, not only with veneration but affection. It plea&s;ed me to find that he was &s;o much <HI>beloved</HI> in his native city.</P>
<P>Mrs. A&s;ton, whom I had &s;een the preceding night, and her &s;i&s;ter, Mrs. Ga&s;trel, a widow lady, had each a hou&s;e and garden, and plea&s;ure ground, prettily &s;ituated upon Stowhill, a gentle eminence adjoining to Lichfield. John&s;on walked away to dinner there, leaving me by my&s;elf without any apology; I wondered at this want of that facility of manners, from which a man has no difficulty in carrying a friend to a hou&s;e where he is intimate; I felt it very unplea&s;ant to be thus left in &s;olitude in a country town, where I was an entire &s;tranger, and began to think my&s;elf unkindly de&s;erted; but I was &s;oon relieved, and convinced that my friend in&s;tead of being deficient in delicacy, had conducted the matter with perfect propriety, for I received the following
<PB N="40" REF="41">
 note in his hand-writing: <Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Ga&s;trel, at the lower hou&s;e on Stowhill, de&s;ires Mr. Bo&s;well's company to dinner at two."</Q> I accepted of the invitation, and had here another proof how amiable his character was in the opinion of tho&s;e who knew him be&s;t. I was not informed, till afterwards, that Mrs. Ga&s;trel's hu&s;band was the clergyman who, while he lived at Stratford upon Avon, where he was proprietor of Shak&s;peare's garden, with Gothick barbarity cut down his mulberry-tree, and, as Dr. John&s;on told me, did it to vex his neighbours. His lady, I have rea&s;on to believe, participated in the guilt of what the enthu&s;ia&s;ts for our immortal bard deem almo&s;t a &s;pecies of &s;acrilege.</P>
<P>After dinner Dr. John&s;on wrote a letter to Mrs. Thrale, on the death of her &s;on. I &s;aid it would be very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to Thrale, but &s;he would &s;oon forget it, as &s;he had &s;o many things to think of. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, Thrale will forget it fir&s;t. <HI>She</HI> has many things that &s;he <HI>may</HI> think of. <HI>He</HI> has many things that he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> think of."</Q> This was a very ju&s;t remark upon the different effect of tho&s;e light pur&s;uits which occupy a vacant and ea&s;y mind, and tho&s;e &s;erious engagements which arre&s;t attention, and keep us from brooding over grief.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved of Lord Bute, <Q REND="inline">"It was &s;aid of Augu&s;tus, that it would have been better for Rome that he had never been born, or had never died. So it would have been better for this nation if Lord Bute had never been mini&s;ter, or had never re&s;igned."</Q></P>
<P>In the evening we went to the Town-hall, which was converted into a temporary theatre, and &s;aw <Q REND="inline">"Theodo&s;ius,"</Q> with <Q REND="inline">"The Stratford Jubilee."</Q> I was happy to &s;ee Dr. John&s;on &s;itting in a con&s;picuous part of the pit, and receiving affectionate homage from all his acquaintance. We were quite gay and merry. I afterwards mentioned to him that I condemned my&s;elf for being &s;o, when poor Mr. and Mrs. Thrale were in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"You are wrong, Sir; twenty years hence Mr. and Mrs. Thrale will not &s;uffer much pain from the death of their &s;on. Now, Sir, you are to con&s;ider that di&s;tance of place, as well as di&s;tance of time, operates upon the human feelings. I would not have you be gay in the pre&s;ence of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e it would &s;hock them; but you may be gay at a di&s;tance. Pain for the lo&s;s of a friend, or of a relation whom we love, is occa&s;ioned by the want which we feel. In time the vacuity is filled with &s;omething el&s;e; or, &s;ometimes the vacuity clo&s;es up of it&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Seward and Mr. Pear&s;on, another clergyman here, &s;upt with us at our inn, and after they left us, we &s;at up late as we u&s;ed to do in London.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42" MS="y">
Here I &s;hall record &s;ome fragments of my friend's conver&s;ation during this  jaunt.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Marriage, Sir, is much more nece&s;&s;ary to a man than to a woman; for he is much le&s;s able to &s;upply him&s;elf with dome&s;tick comforts. You will recollect my &s;aying to &s;ome ladies the other day, that I had often wondered why young women &s;hould marry, as they have &s;o much more freedom, and &s;o much more attention paid to them while unmarried, than when married. I indeed did not mention the <HI>&s;trong</HI> rea&s;on for their marrying&mdash;the <HI>mechanical</HI> rea&s;on."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Why that <HI>is</HI> a &s;trong one. But does not imagination make it &s;eem much more important than it is in reality? Is it not, to a cer|tain degree, a delu&s;ion in us as well as in women?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, Sir; but it is a delu&s;ion that is always beginning again."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I don't know but there is upon the whole more mi&s;ery than happine&s;s produced by that pa&s;&s;ion."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I don't think &s;o, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Never &s;peak of a man in his own pre&s;ence. It is always indelicate, and may be offen&s;ive."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Que&s;tioning is not the mode of conver&s;ation among gentlemen. It is a&s;&s;uming a &s;uperiority, and it is particularly wrong to que&s;tion a man con|cerning him&s;elf. There may be parts of his former life which he may not wi&s;h to be made known to other per&s;ons, or even brought to his own re|collection."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A man &s;hould be careful never to tell tales of him&s;elf to his own di&s;|advantage. People may be amu&s;ed and laugh at the time, but they will be remembered, and brought out again&s;t him upon &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent occa&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Much may be done if a man puts his whole mind to a particular object. By doing &s;o, Norton has made him&s;elf the great lawyer that he is allowed to be."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned an acquaintance of mine, a &s;ectary, who was a very religious man, who not only attended regularly on publick wor&s;hip with tho&s;e of his communion, but made a particular &s;tudy of the Scriptures, and even wrote a commentary on &s;ome parts of them, yet was known to be very licentious in indulging him&s;elf with women, maintaining that men are to be &s;aved by faith alone, and that the Chri&s;tian religion had not pre&s;cribed any fixed rule for the intercour&s;e between the &s;exes. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, there is no tru&s;ting to that crazy piety."</Q></P>
<P>I Ob&s;erved that it was &s;trange how well Scotchmen were known to one another in their own country, though born in very di&s;tant counties; for we do not find that the gentlemen of neighbouring counties in England are
<PB N="42" REF="43" MS="y">
 mutually known to each other. John&s;on, with his u&s;ual acutene&s;s, at once &s;aw and explained the rea&s;on of this, <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, you have Edinburgh, where the gentlemen from all your counties meet, and which is not &s;o large but that they are all known. There is no &s;uch common place of collection in England, except London, where from its great &s;ize and diffu&s;ion, many of tho&s;e who re&s;ide in contiguous counties of England may long remain unknown to each other."</Q></P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, March 26, there came for us an equipage properly &s;uited to a wealthy well-beneficed clergyman&mdash;Dr. Taylor's large, roomy po&s;t-chai&s;e, drawn by four &s;tout plump hor&s;es, and driven by two &s;teady jolly po&s;tillions, which conveyed us to A&s;hbourne, where I found my friend's &s;choolfellow living upon an e&s;tabli&s;hment perfectly corre&s;ponding with his &s;ub&s;tantial creditable equipage. His hou&s;e, garden, plea&s;ure-grounds, table, in &s;hort every thing good, and no &s;cantine&s;s appearing. Every man &s;hould form &s;uch a plan of living as he can execute completely. Let him not draw an outline wider than he can fill up. I have &s;een many &s;keletons of &s;hew and magnificence which excite at once ridicule and pity. Dr. Taylor had a good e&s;tate of his own, and good preferment in the church, being a prebendary of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and rector of Bo&s;worth. He was a diligent ju&s;tice of the peace, and pre&s;ided over the town of A&s;hbourne, to the inhabitants of which I was told he was very liberal; and as a proof of this it was mentioned to me, he had the preceding winter, di&s;tributed two hundred pounds among &s;uch of them as &s;tood in need of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He had con&s;equently a con&s;iderable political intere&s;t in the county of Derby, which he employed to &s;upport the Devon&s;hire family; for though the &s;choolfellow and friend of John&s;on, he was a Whig. I could not perceive in his character much congeniality of any &s;ort with that of John&s;on, who, however, &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he has a very &s;trong under|&s;tanding."</Q> His &s;ize and figure, and countenance, and manner, were that of a hearty Engli&s;h 'Squire, with the par&s;on &s;uper-induced; and I took particular notice of his upper &s;ervant, Mr. Peters, a decent grave man, in purple clothes, and a large white wig, like the butler or <HI>major domo</HI> of a Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on and Dr. Taylor met with great cordiality; and John&s;on &s;oon gave him the &s;ame &s;ad account of their &s;choolfellow, Congreve, that he had given to Mr. Hector; adding a remark of &s;uch moment to the rational conduct of a man in the decline of life, that it de&s;erves to be imprinted upon every mind: <Q REND="inline">"There is nothing again&s;t which an old man &s;hould be &s;o much upon his guard as putting him&s;elf to nur&s;e."</Q> Innumerable have been the melancholy in&s;tances of men once di&s;tingui&s;hed for firmne&s;s, re&s;olution,
<PB N="43" REF="44" MS="y">
and &s;pirit, who in their latter days have been governed like children, by inte|re&s;ted  female artifice.</P>
<P>Dr. Taylor commended a phy&s;ician who was known to him and Dr. John&s;on, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I fight many battles for him, as many people in the country di&s;like him."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But you &s;hould con&s;ider, Sir, that by every one of your victories he is a lo&s;er; for, every man of whom you get the better, will be very angry, and will re&s;olve not to employ him; whereas if people get the better of you in argument about him, they'll think, 'We'll &s;end for Dr. ****** neverthele&s;s."</Q> This was an ob&s;ervation deep and &s;ure in human nature.</P>
<P>Next day we talked of a book in which an eminent judge was arraigned before the bar of the publick, as having pronounced an unju&s;t deci&s;ion in a great cau&s;e. Dr. John&s;on maintained that this publication would not give any unea&s;ine&s;s to the Judge. <Q REND="inline">"For (&s;aid he,) either he acted hone&s;tly, or he meant to do inju&s;tice. If he acted hone&s;tly, his own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s will protect him; if he meant to do inju&s;tice, he will be glad to &s;ee the man who attacks him, &s;o much vexed."</Q></P>
<P>Next day, as Dr. John&s;on had acquainted Dr. Taylor of the rea&s;on for his returning &s;peedily to London, it was re&s;olved that we &s;hould &s;et out after dinner. A few of Dr. Taylor's neighbours were his gue&s;ts that day.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on talked with approbation of one who had attained to the &s;tate of the philo&s;ophical wi&s;e man, that is, to have no want of any thing. <Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, (&s;aid I,) the &s;avage is a wi&s;e man."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) I do not mean &s;imply being without,&mdash;but not having a want."</Q> I maintained, again&s;t this propo&s;ition, that it was better to have fine clothes, for in&s;tance, than not to feel the want of them." JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; fine clothes are good only as they &s;upply the want of other means of procuring re&s;pect. Was Charles the Twelfth, think you, le&s;s re&s;pected for his coar&s;e blue coat and black &s;tock? And you find the King of Pru&s;&s;ia dre&s;&s;es plain, becau&s;e the dignity of his character is &s;ufficient."</Q> I here brought my&s;elf into a &s;crape, for I heedle&s;sly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Would not <HI>you,</HI> Sir, be the better for velvet and embroidery?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you put an end to all argument when you introduce your opponent him&s;elf. Have you no better manners? There is <HI>your want.</HI>"</Q> I apologi&s;ed by &s;aying, I had mentioned him as an in&s;tance of one who wanted as little as any man in the world, and yet, perhaps, might receive &s;ome additional lu&s;tre from dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Having left A&s;hbourne in the evening, we &s;topped to change hor&s;es at Derby, and availed our&s;elves of a moment to enjoy the conver&s;ation of my
<PB N="44" REF="45" MS="y">
 countryman, Dr. Butter, then phy&s;ician there. He was in great indignation becau&s;e Lord Mount&s;tuart's bill for a Scotch militia had been lo&s;t. Dr. John&s;on was as violent again&s;t it. <Q REND="inline">"I am glad, (&s;aid he,) that Parliament has had the &s;pirit to throw it out. You wanted to take advantage of the timidity of our &s;coundrels <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">See page 17.</NOTE>,"</Q> (meaning, I &s;uppo&s;e, the mini&s;try). It may be ob&s;erved, that he u&s;ed the epithet &s;coundrel very commonly, not quite in the &s;en&s;e in which it is generally under&s;tood, but as a &s;trong term of di&s;appro|bation; as when he abruptly an&s;wered Mrs. Thrale, who had a&s;ked him how he did, <Q REND="inline">"Ready to become a &s;coundrel, Madam; with a little more &s;poiling you will, I think, make me a complete ra&s;cal <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Anecdotes of John&s;on, p. 176.</NOTE>:"</Q>&mdash;he meant, ea&s;y to become a capricious and &s;elf-indulgent valetudinarian; a character for which I have heard him expre&s;s great di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>John&s;on had with him upon this jaunt, <Q REND="inline">"Il Palermino d'Inghilterra,"</Q> a romance prai&s;ed by Cervantes; but did not like it much. He &s;aid, he read it for the language, by way of preparation for his Italian expedition.&mdash;We lay this night at Loughborough.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, March 28, we pur&s;ued our journey. I mentioned that old Mr. Sheridan complained of the ingratitude of Mr. Wedderburne and General Fra&s;er, who had been much obliged to him when they were young Scotch|men entering upon life in England. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, a man is very apt to complain of the ingratitude of tho&s;e who have ri&s;en far above him. A man when he gets into a higher &s;phere, into other habits of life, cannot keep up all his former connections. Then, Sir, tho&s;e who knew him formerly upon a level with them&s;elves, may think that they ought &s;till to be treated as on a level, which cannot be; and an acquaintance in a former &s;ituation may bring out things which it would be very di&s;agreeable to have mentioned before higher company, though, perhaps, every body knows of them."</Q> He placed this &s;ubject in a new light to me, and &s;hewed that a man, who has ri&s;en in the world, mu&s;t not be condemned too har&s;hly, for being di&s;tant to former acquaintance, even though he may have been much obliged to them. It is, no doubt, to be wi&s;hed that a proper degree of attention &s;hould be &s;hewn by great men to their early friends. But if either from obtu&s;e in&s;en&s;ibility to difference of &s;ituation, or pre&s;umptuous forwardne&s;s, which will not &s;ubmit even to an exteriour ob&s;ervance of it, the dignity of high place cannot be pre&s;erved, when they are admitted into the company of tho&s;e rai&s;ed above the &s;tate in which they once were, encroachment mu&s;t be repelled, and
<PB N="45" REF="46" MS="y">
the kinder feelings &s;acrificed. To one of the very fortunate per&s;ons whom  I have mentioned, namely, Mr. Wedderburne, now Lord Loughborough, I mu&s;t do the ju&s;tice to relate, that I have been a&s;&s;ured by another early acquaintance of his, old Mr. Macklin, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in improving his pronunciation, that he had found him very grateful. Macklin, I &s;uppo&s;e, had not pre&s;&s;ed upon his elevation with &s;o much eagerne&s;s as the gentleman who complained of him. Dr. John&s;on's remark as to the jealou&s;y entertained of our friends who ri&s;e far above us, is certainly very ju&s;t. By this was withered the early friend&s;hip between Charles Town&s;hend and Aken&s;ide; and many &s;imilar in&s;tances might be adduced.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It is commonly a weak man who marries for love."</Q> We then talked of marrying women of fortune; and I mentioned a common remark, that a man may be, upon the whole, richer by marrying a woman with a very &s;mall portion, becau&s;e a woman of fortune will be proportionally expen|&s;ive; whereas a woman who brings none will be very moderate in expences. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Depend upon it, Sir, this is not true. A woman of fortune being u&s;ed to the handling of money, &s;pends it judiciou&s;ly: but a woman who gets the command of money for the fir&s;t time upon her marriage, has &s;uch a gu&s;t in &s;pending it, that &s;he throws it away with great profu&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P>He prai&s;ed the ladies of the pre&s;ent age, in&s;i&s;ting that they were more faithful to their hu&s;bands, and more virtuous in every re&s;pect, than in former times, becau&s;e their under&s;tandings were better cultivated. It was an undoubted proof of his good &s;en&s;e and good di&s;po&s;ition, that he was never querulous, never prone to inveigh again&s;t the pre&s;ent times, as is &s;o common when &s;uper|ficial minds are on the fret. On the contrary, he was willing to &s;peak favour|ably of his own age; and, indeed, maintained its &s;uperiority in every re&s;pect, except in its reverence for government; the relaxation of which he imputed, as its grand cau&s;e, to the &s;hock which our monarchy received at the Revolution, though nece&s;&s;ary; and &s;econdly, to the timid conce&s;&s;ions made to faction by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive admini&s;trations in the reign of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty. I am happy to think, that he lived to &s;ee the Crown at la&s;t recover its ju&s;t influence.</P>
<P>At Leice&s;ter we read in the new&s;papers that Dr. James was dead. I thought that the death of an old &s;chool-fellow, and one with whom he had lived a good deal in London, would have affected my fellow-traveller much: but he only &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! poor Jamy."</Q> Afterwards, however, when we were in the chai&s;e, he &s;aid, with more tenderne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"Since I &s;et out on this jaunt, I have lo&s;t an old friend and a young one;&mdash;Dr. James, and poor Harry,"</Q> (meaning Mr. Thrale's &s;on).</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47" MS="y">
 Having lain at St. Alban's on Thur&s;day, March 28, we breakfa&s;ted the next morning at Barnet. I expre&s;&s;ed to him a weakne&s;s of mind which I could not help;&mdash;an unea&s;y apprehen&s;ion that my wife-and children, who were at a great di&s;tance from me, might, perhaps, be ill. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) con&s;ider how fooli&s;h you &s;hould think it in <HI>them</HI> to be apprehen&s;ive that <HI>you</HI> are ill."</Q> This &s;udden turn relieved me for the moment; but I afterwards perceived it to be an ingenious fallacy. I might, to be &s;ure, be &s;atisfied that they had no rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive about me, becau&s;e I <HI>knew</HI> that I my&s;elf was well: but we might have a mutual anxiety, without the charge of folly; becau&s;e each was, in &s;ome degree, uncertain as to the condition of the other.</P>
<P>I enjoyed the luxury of our approach to London, that metropolis which we both loved &s;o much, for the high and varied intellectual plea&s;ure which it furni&s;hes. I experienced immediate happine&s;s while whirled along with &s;uch a companion, and &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you ob&s;erved one day at General Oglethorpe's, that a man is never happy for the pre&s;ent, but when he is drunk. Will you not add,&mdash;or when driving rapidly in a po&s;t-chai&s;e?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, you are driving rapidly <HI>from</HI> &s;omething, or <HI>to</HI> &s;omething."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of melancholy, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Some men, and very thinking men too, have not tho&s;e vexing thoughts. Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds is the &s;ame all the year round. Beauclerk, except when ill and in pain, is the &s;ame. But I believe mo&s;t men have them in the degree in which they are capable of having them. If I were in the country, and were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by that malady, I would force my&s;elf to take a book; and every time I did it I &s;hould find it the ea&s;ier. Melancholy, indeed, &s;hould be diverted by every means but drinking."</Q></P>
<P>We &s;topped at Me&s;&s;ieurs Dillys, book&s;ellers in the Poultry; from whence he hurried away, in a hackney coach, to Mr. Thrale's in the Borough. I called at his hou&s;e in the evening, having promi&s;ed to acquaint Mrs. Williams of his &s;afe return; when, to my &s;urprize, I found him &s;itting with her at tea, and, as I thought, not in a very good humour: for, it &s;eems, when he got to Mr. Thrale's, he found the coach was at the door waiting to carry Mrs. and Mi&s;s Thrale, and Signor Baretti their Italian ma&s;ter, to Bath. This was not &s;hewing the attention which might have been expected to the <Q REND="inline">"Guide, Philo&s;opher, and Friend,"</Q> the <HI>Imlack</HI> who had ha&s;tened from the country to con&s;ole a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mother, who he under&s;tood was very anxious for his return. They had, I found, without ceremony, proceeded on their intended journey. I was glad to under&s;tand from him that it was &s;till re&s;olved that his tour to Italy with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale &s;hould take place, of which he had entertained &s;ome doubt, on account of the lo&s;s which they had &s;uffered; and
<PB N="47" REF="48" MS="y">
his doubts afterwards proved to be well-founded. He ob&s;erved, indeed very  ju&s;tly, that <Q REND="inline">"their lo&s;s was an additional rea&s;on for their going abroad; and if it had not been fixed that he &s;hould have been one of the party, he would force them out; but he would not advi&s;e them unle&s;s his advice was a&s;ked, le&s;t they might &s;u&s;pect that he recommended what he wi&s;hed on his own account."</Q> I was not plea&s;ed that his intimacy with Mr. Thrale's family, though it no doubt contributed much to his comfort and enjoyment, was not without &s;ome degree of re&s;traint. Not, as has been gro&s;sly &s;ugge&s;ted, that it was required of him as a ta&s;k to talk for the entertainment of them and their company; but that he was not quite at his ea&s;e; which, however, might partly be owing to his own hone&s;t pride&mdash;that dignity of mind which is always jealous of appearing too compliant.</P>
<P>On Sunday, March 31, I called on him, and &s;hewed him as a curio&s;ity which I had di&s;covered, his <Q REND="inline">"Tran&s;lation of Lobo's Account of Aby&s;&s;inia,"</Q> which Sir John Pringle had lent me, it being then little known as one of his works. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Take no notice of it, or don't talk of it."</Q> He &s;eemed to think it beneath him, though done at &s;ix-and-twenty. I &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"Your &s;tyle, Sir, is much improved &s;ince you tran&s;lated this."</Q> He an&s;wered with a &s;ort of triumphant &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I hope it is."</Q></P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, April 3, in the forenoon, I found him very bu&s;y putting his books in order, and as they were generally very old ones, clouds of du&s;t were flying around him. He had on a pair of large gloves, &s;uch as hedgers u&s;e. His pre&s;ent appearance put me in mind of my uncle, Dr. Bo&s;well's de&s;cription of him, <Q REND="inline">"A robu&s;t genius, born to grapple with whole libraries."</Q></P>
<P>I gave him an account of a conver&s;ation which had pa&s;&s;ed between me and Captain Cook, the day before at dinner at Sir John Pringle's, and he was much plea&s;ed with the con&s;cientious accuracy of that celebrated circum|navigator, who &s;et me right as to many of the exaggerated accounts given by Dr. Hawke&s;worth of his Voyages. I told him that while I was with the Captain, I catched the enthu&s;ia&s;m of curio&s;ity and adventure, and felt a &s;trong inclination to go with him on his next voyage. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, a man <HI>does</HI> &s;eel &s;o, till he con&s;iders how very little he can learn from &s;uch voyages."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But one is carried away with the general grand and indi&s;tinct notion of A VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, but a man is to guard him&s;elf again&s;t taking a thing in general."</Q> I &s;aid I was certain that a great part of what we are told by the travellers to the South Sea mu&s;t be conjecture, becau&s;e they had not enough of the
<PB N="48" REF="49">
 language of tho&s;e countries to under&s;tand &s;o much as they have related. Objects falling under the ob&s;ervation of the &s;en&s;es might be clearly known; but every thing intellectual, every thing ab&s;tract&mdash;politicks, morals, and religion, mu&s;t be darkly gue&s;&s;ed. Dr. John&s;on was of the &s;ame opinion. He upon another occa&s;ion, when a friend mentioned to him &s;everal extra|ordinary facts, as communicated to him by the circumnavigators, &s;lily ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I never before knew how much I was re&s;pected by the&s;e gentlemen; they told <HI>me</HI> none of the&s;e things."</Q></P>
<P>He had been in company with Omai, a native of one of the South Sea i&s;lands, after he had been &s;ome time in this country. He was &s;truck with the elegance of his behaviour, and accounted for it thus: <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he had pa&s;&s;ed his time, while in England, only in the be&s;t company; &s;o that all that he had acquired of our manners was genteel. As a proof of this, Sir, Lord Mulgrave and he dined one day at Streatham; they &s;at with their backs to the light fronting me, &s;o that I could not &s;ee di&s;tinctly; and there was &s;o little of the &s;avage in Omai, that I was afraid to &s;peak to either, left I &s;hould mi&s;take one for the other."</Q></P>
<P>We agreed to dine to-day at the Mitre-tavern, after the ri&s;ing of the Hou&s;e of Lords, where a branch of the litigation concerning the Douglas e&s;tate, in which I was one of the coun&s;el, was to come on. I brought with me Mr. Murray, Solicitor-General of Scotland, now one of the Judges of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, with the title of Lord Henderland. I mentioned Mr. Solicitor's relation, Lord Charles Hay, with whom I knew Dr. John&s;on had been acquainted. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I wrote &s;omething for Lord Charles; and I thought he had nothing to fear from a court-martial. I &s;uffered a great lo&s;s when he died; he was a mighty plea&s;ing man in conver&s;ation, and a reading man. The character of a &s;oldier is high. They who &s;tand forth the foremo&s;t in danger, for the community, have the re&s;pect of mankind. An officer is much more re&s;pected than any other man who has as little money. In a commercial country money will always purcha&s;e re&s;pect. But you find, an officer, who has properly &s;peaking, no money, is every where well received and treated with attention. The character of a &s;oldier always &s;tands him in &s;tead."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Yet, Sir, I think that common &s;oldiers are wor&s;e thought of than other men in the &s;ame rank of life; &s;uch as labourers."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, a common &s;oldier is u&s;ually a very gro&s;s man, and any quality which procures re&s;pect may be overwhelmed by gro&s;&s;ne&s;s. A man of learning may be &s;o vicious or &s;o ridiculous that you cannot re&s;pect him. A common &s;oldier too, generally eats more than he can pay for. But when a common &s;oldier is civil in his quarters, his red coat procures him a degree of re&s;pect."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50" MS="y">
The peculiar re&s;pect paid to the military character in France was mentioned  BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould think that where military men are &s;o numerous, they would be le&s;s valued as not being rare."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, wherever a particular character or profe&s;&s;ion is high in the e&s;timation of a people, tho&s;e who are of it will be valued above other men. We value an Engli&s;hman highly in this country, and yet Engli&s;hmen are not rare in it."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Murray prai&s;ed the ancient philo&s;ophers for the candour and good humour with which tho&s;e of different &s;ects di&s;puted with each other. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, they di&s;puted with good humour, becau&s;e they were not in earne&s;t as to religion. Had the ancients been &s;erious in their belief, we &s;hould not have had their Gods exhibited in the manner we find them repre&s;ented in the Poets. The people would not have &s;uffered it. They di&s;puted with good humour upon their fanciful theories, becau&s;e they were not intere&s;ted in the truth of them. When a man has nothing to lo&s;e, he may be in good humour with his opponent. Accordingly you &s;ee in Lucian, the Epicurean, who argues only negatively, keeps his temper; the Stoick, who has &s;omething po&s;itive to pre&s;erve, grows angry. Being angry with one who controverts an opinion which you value, is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the unea&s;ine&s;s which you feel. Every man who attacks my belief, dimini&s;hes in &s;ome degree my confidence in it, and therefore makes me unea&s;y, and I am angry with him who makes me unea&s;y. Tho&s;e only who believed in Revelation have been angry at having their faith called in que&s;tion; becau&s;e they only had &s;ome|thing upon which they could re&s;t as matter of fact."</Q> MURRAY. <Q REND="inline">"It &s;eems to me that we are not angry at a man for controverting an opinion which we believe and value; we rather pity him."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir; to be &s;ure when you wi&s;h a man to have that belief which you think is of infinite advan|tage, you wi&s;h well to him; but your primary con&s;ideration is your own quiet. If a madman were to come into this room with a &s;tick in his hand, no doubt we &s;hould pity the &s;tate of his mind; but our primary con&s;ideration would be to take care of our&s;elves. We &s;hould knock him down fir&s;t, and pity him afterwards. No, Sir; every man will di&s;pute with great good humour upon a &s;ubject in which he is not intere&s;ted. I will di&s;pute very calmly upon the probability of another man's &s;on being hanged, but if a man zealou&s;ly enforces the probability that my own &s;on will be hanged, I &s;hall certainly not be in very good humour with him."</Q> I added this illu&s;tration, <Q REND="inline">"If a man endeavours to convince me that my wife, whom I love very much, and in whom I have great confidence, is a di&s;agreeable woman, and is even unfaithful to me, I &s;hall be very angry, for he is putting me in fear of being unhappy."</Q> MURRAY. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, truth will always bear an
<PB N="50" REF="51" MS="y">
 examination."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, but it is painful to be forced to defend it. Con&s;ider, Sir, how &s;hould you like, though con&s;cious of your innocence, to be tried before a jury for a capital crime, once a week."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of education at great &s;chools, the advantages and di&s;advan|tages of which John&s;on di&s;played in a luminous manner; but his arguments preponderated &s;o much in favour of the benefit which a boy of good parts might receive at one of them, that I have rea&s;on to believe Mr. Murray was very much influenced by what he had heard to-day, in his determination to &s;end his own &s;on to We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool.</P>
<P>I introduced the topick, which is often ignorantly urged, that the Univer&s;ities of England are too rich, &s;o that learning does not flouri&s;h in them as it would do, if tho&s;e who teach had &s;maller &s;alaries, and depended on their a&s;&s;iduity for a great part of their income. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the very rever&s;e of this is the truth; the Engli&s;h Univer&s;ities are not rich enough. Our fellow&s;hips are only &s;ufficient to &s;upport a man during his &s;tudies to fit him for the world, and accordingly in general they are held no longer than till an opportunity offers of getting away. Now and then, perhaps, there is a fellow who grows old in his college; but this is again&s;t his will, unle&s;s he be a man very indolent indeed. A hundred a year is reckoned a good fellow&s;hip, and that is no more than is nece&s;&s;ary to keep a man decently as a &s;cholar. We do not allow our fellows to marry, becau&s;e we con&s;ider academical in&s;titutions as preparatory to a &s;ettlement in the world. It is only by being employed as a tutor, that a fellow can obtain any thing more than a livelihood. To be &s;ure a man, who has enough without teaching, will pro|bably not teach; for we would all be idle if we could. In the &s;ame manner, a man who is to get nothing by teaching, will not exert him&s;elf. Gre&s;ham-College was intended as a place of in&s;truction for London; able Profe&s;&s;ors were to read lectures gratis, they contrived to have no &s;cholars; whereas, if they had been allowed to receive but &s;ix-pence a lecture from each &s;cholar, they would have been emulous to have had many &s;cholars. Every body will agree that it &s;hould be the intere&s;t of tho&s;e who teach to have &s;cholars; and this is the ca&s;e in our Univer&s;ities. That they are too rich is certainly not true; for they have nothing good enough to keep a man of eminent learning with them for his life. In the foreign Univer&s;ities a profe&s;&s;or&s;hip is a high thing. It is as much almo&s;t as a man can make by his learning; and therefore we find the mo&s;t learned men abroad are in the Univer&s;ities. It is not &s;o with us. Our Uiver&s;ities are impoveri&s;hed of learning, by the penury of their provi&s;ions. I wi&s;h there were many places of a thou&s;and a-year at Oxford, to keep fir&s;t rate men of learning from quitting the Univer&s;ity."</Q> Undoubtedly,
<PB N="51" REF="52" MS="y">
if this were the ca&s;e, Literature would have a &s;till greater dignity and &s;plendour  at Oxford, and there would be grander living &s;ources of in&s;truction.</P>
<P>I mentioned Mr. Maclaurin's unea&s;ine&s;s on account of a degree of ridicule carele&s;sly thrown on his decea&s;ed father, in Gold&s;mith's <Q REND="inline">"Hi&s;tory of Animated Nature,"</Q> in which that celebrated mathematician is repre&s;ented as being &s;ubject to fits of yawning &s;o violent as to render him incapable of proceeding in his lecture; a &s;tory altogether unfounded, but for the publication of which the law would give no reparation <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Dr. Gold&s;mith was dead before Mr. Maclaurin di&s;covered the ludicrous errour. But Mr. Nour&s;e, the book&s;eller, who was the proprietor of the work, upon being applied to by Sir John Pringle, agreed very hand&s;omely to have the leaf on which it was contained cancelled, and re-printed without it, at his own expence.</NOTE>. This led us to agitate the que&s;tion, whether legal redre&s;s could be obtained, even when a man's decea&s;ed relation was calumniated in a publication. Mr. Murray maintained there &s;hould be repara|tion, unle&s;s the authour could ju&s;tify him&s;elf by proving the fact. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is of &s;o much more con&s;equence that truth &s;hould be told, than that individuals &s;hould not be made unea&s;y, that it is much better that the law does not re&s;train writing freely concerning the characters of the dead. Damages will be given to a man who is calumniated in his life-time, becau&s;e he may be hurt in his worldly intere&s;t, or at lea&s;t hurt in his mind: but the law does not regard that unea&s;ine&s;s which a man feels on having his ance&s;tor calumniated. That is too nice. Let him deny what is &s;aid, and let the matter have a fair chance by di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. But, if a man could &s;ay nothing again&s;t a character but what he can prove, hi&s;tory could not be written; for a great deal is known of men of which proof cannot be brought. A mini&s;ter may be notoriou&s;ly known to take bribes, and yet you may not be able to prove it."</Q> Mr. Murray &s;ugge&s;ted, that the authour &s;hould be obliged to &s;hew &s;ome &s;ort of evidence, though he would not require a &s;trict legal proof: but John&s;on firmly and re&s;olutely oppo&s;ed any re&s;traint whatever, as adver&s;e to a free inve&s;tigation of the characters of mankind <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">What Dr. John&s;on has here &s;aid, is undoubtedly good &s;en&s;e; yet I am afraid that law, though defined by Lord Coke <Q REND="inline">"the perfection of rea&s;on,"</Q> is not altogether with him; for it is held in the books, that an attack on the reputation even of a dead man, may be puni&s;hed as a libel, becau&s;e tending to a breach of the peace. There is however, I believe, no modern decided ca&s;e to that effect. In the King's Bench, Trinity Term, 1790, the que&s;tion occurred on occa&s;ion of an indictment, <HI>The King</HI> v. <HI>Topham,</HI> who, as a <HI>proprietor</HI> of a new&s;paper entitled <Q REND="inline">"THE WORLD,"</Q> was found guilty of a libel again&s;t Earl Cowper, decea&s;ed, becau&s;e certain injurious charges again&s;t his Lord&s;hip were publi&s;hed in that paper. One of the coun&s;el for Mr. Topham, my friend Mr. Con&s;t, who is very able to maintain the argument with learning and ingenuity, informs me that it is intended to move in arre&s;t of judgement; &s;o that we &s;hall probably have a &s;olemn determination, upon a point of univer&s;al importance. No man has a higher reverence for the law of England in general than I have; but, with all deference I cannot help thinking, that pro&s;ecution by indict|ment, if a defendant is never to be allowed to ju&s;tify, mu&s;t often be very oppre&s;&s;ive, unle&s;s Juries, who I am more and more confirmed in holding to be judges of law as well as of fact, interpo&s;e.</NOTE>.</P>

 On Thur&s;day, April 4, having called on Dr. John&s;on, I &s;aid, it was a pity that truth was not &s;o firm as to bid defiance to all attacks, &s;o that it might be &s;hot at as much as people cho&s;e to attempt, and yet remain unhurt. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, it would not be &s;hot at. Nobody attempts to di&s;pute that two and two make four: but with conte&s;ts concerning moral truth, human pa&s;&s;ions are generally mixed, and therefore it mu&s;t ever be liable to a&s;&s;ault and mi&s;repre&s;entation."</Q></P>
<P>On Friday, April 5, being Good-Friday, after having attended the morning &s;ervice at St. Clement's church, I walked home with John&s;on. We talked of the Roman Catholick religion. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"In the barbarous ages, Sir, prie&s;ts and people were equally deceived; but afterwards there were gro&s;s corruptions introduced by the clergy, &s;uch as indulgences to prie&s;ts to have concubines, and the wor&s;hip of images, not, indeed, inculcated, but knowingly permitted."</Q> He &s;trongly cen&s;ured the licen&s;ed &s;tews at Rome. BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"So then, Sir, you would allow of no irregular intercour&s;e whatever between the &s;exes?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure I would not, Sir. I would puni&s;h it much more than is done, and &s;o re&s;train it. In all countries there has been fornication, as in all countries there has been theft; but there may be more or le&s;s of the one, as well as of the other, in proportion to the force of law. All men will naturally commit fornication, as all men will naturally &s;teal. And, Sir, it is very ab&s;urd to argue, as has been often done, that pro&s;titutes are nece&s;&s;ary to pre|vent the violent effects of appetite from violating the decent order of life; nay, &s;hould be permitted, in order to pre&s;erve the cha&s;tity of our wives and daughters. Depend upon it, Sir, &s;evere laws, &s;teadily enforced, would be &s;ufficient again&s;t tho&s;e evils, and would promote marriage."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;tated to him this ca&s;e:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Suppo&s;e a man has a daughter who he knows has been &s;educed, but her misfortune is concealed from the world: &s;hould he keep her in his hou&s;e? Would he not, by doing &s;o, be acce&s;&s;ary to impo&s;ition? And, perhaps, a worthy un&s;u&s;pecting man might come and marry this woman, unle&s;s the father inform him of the truth."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he is acce&s;&s;ary to no impo&s;ition. His daughter is in his hou&s;e; and if a man courts her, he takes his chance. If a friend, or, indeed, if any man a&s;ks his opinion whether he &s;hould marry her, he ought to advi&s;e him again&s;t it, without tell|ing why, becau&s;e his real opinion is then required. Or, if he has other
<PB N="53" REF="54" MS="y">
daughters who know of her frailty, he ought not to keep her in his hou&s;e.  You are to con&s;ider the &s;tate of life is this; we are to judge of one another's characters as well as we can; and a man is not bound, in hone&s;ty or honour, to tell us the faults of his daughter or of him&s;elf. A man who has debauched his friend's daughter is not obliged to &s;ay to every body&mdash;'Take care of me don't let me into your hou&s;es without &s;u&s;picion. I once debauched a friend's daughter: I may debauch yours."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Thrale called upon him, and appeared to bear the lo&s;s of his &s;on with a manly compo&s;ure. There was no affectation about him; and he talked, as u&s;ual, upon indifferent &s;ubjects. He &s;eemed to me to he&s;itate as to the intended Italian tour, on which, I flattered my&s;elf, he and Mrs. Thrale and Dr. John&s;on were &s;oon to &s;et out; and, therefore, I pre&s;&s;ed it as much as I could. I mentioned that Mr. Beauclerk had &s;aid, that Baretti, whom they were to carry with them, would keep them &s;o long in the little towns of his own di&s;trict, that they would not have time to &s;ee Rome. I mentioned this, to put them on their guard. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, we do not thank Mr. Beauclerk for &s;uppo&s;ing that we are to be directed by Baretti. No, Sir; Mr. Thrale is to go, by my advice, to Mr. Jack&s;on, (the all-knowing,) and get from him a plan for &s;eeing the mo&s;t that can be &s;een in the time that we have to travel. We mu&s;t, to be &s;ure, &s;ee Rome, Naples, Florence, and Venice, and as much more as we can,"</Q> (&s;peaking with a tone of animation).</P>
<P>When I expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t wi&s;h for his remarks on Italy, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I do not &s;ee that I could make a book upon Italy; yet I &s;hould be glad to get two hundred pounds, or five hundred pounds by &s;uch a work.</Q> This &s;hewed both that a journal of his Tour upon the Continent was not wholly out of his contemplation, and that he uniformly adhered to that &s;trange opinion, which his indolent di&s;po&s;ition made him utter: <Q REND="inline">"No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money."</Q> Numerous in&s;tances to refute this will occur to all who are ver&s;ed in the hi&s;tory of literature.</P>
<P>He gave us one of the many &s;ketches of character which were trea&s;ured in his mind, and which he was wont to produce quite unexpectedly in a very entertaining manner. <Q REND="inline">"I lately (&s;aid he,) received a letter from the Ea&s;t-Indies, from a gentleman whom I formerly knew very well; he had returned from that country with a hand&s;ome fortune, as it was reckoned, before means were found to acquire tho&s;e immen&s;e &s;ums which have been brought from thence of late; he was a &s;cholar, and an agreeable man, and lived very prettily in London, till his wife died. After her death, he took to di&s;&s;ipation and gaming, and lo&s;t all he had. One evening he lo&s;t a thou&s;and pounds to a gentleman who&s;e name I am &s;orry I have forgotten. Next morning he &s;ent the gentleman
<PB N="54" REF="55" MS="y">
 five hundred pounds, with an apology that it was all he had in the world. The gentleman &s;ent the money back to him, declaring he would not accept it; and adding, that if Mr.&mdash;had oca&s;ion for five hundred pounds more he would lend it to him. He re&s;olved to go out again to the Ea&s;t-Indies, and make his fortune anew. He got a con&s;iderable appointment, and I had &s;ome intention of accompanying him. Had I thought then as I do now, I &s;hould have gone: but, at that time, I had objections to quitting England."</Q></P>
<P>It was a very remarkable circum&s;tance about John&s;on, whom &s;hallow ob&s;ervers have &s;uppo&s;ed to have been ignorant of the world, that very few men had &s;een greater variety of characters; and none could ob&s;erve them better, as was evident from the &s;trong, yet nice portraits which he often drew. I have frequently thought that if he had made out what the French call <HI>une catalogue rai&s;onn&eacute;e</HI> of all the people who had pa&s;&s;ed under his ob&s;ervation, it would have afforded a very rich fund of in&s;truction and entertainment. The &s;uddenne&s;s with which his accounts of &s;ome of them &s;tarted out in conver&s;ation, was not le&s;s plea&s;ing than &s;urpri&s;ing. I remember he once ob&s;erved to me, <Q REND="inline">"It is wonderful, Sir, what is to be found in London. The mo&s;t literary conver&s;ation that I ever enjoyed, was at the table of Jack Ellis, a money|&s;crivener behind the Royal-Exchange, with whom I at one period u&s;ed to dine generally once a week <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">This Mr. Ellis is, I believe, the la&s;t of that profe&s;&s;ion called Scriveners, which is one of the London companies, but of which the bu&s;ine&s;s is no longer carried on &s;eparately, but is tran&s;acted by attornies and others. He is a man of literature and talents. He is the authour of a Hudi|bra&s;tick ver&s;ion of Maphaeus's Canto, in addition to the Aeneid; of &s;ome poems in Dod&s;ley's collection; and various other &s;mall pieces; but being a very mode&s;t man, has never put his name to any thing. He has &s;hewn me a tran&s;lation which he has made of Ovid's Epi&s;tles, very prettily done. There is a good engraved portrait of him by Peffer, from a picture by Fry, which hangs in the hall of the Scriveners' company. He is now a very old man. I have vi&s;ited him this day, (October 4, 1790,) in his ninety-third year, and found his judgement di&s;tinct and clear, and his memory, though faded &s;o as to fail him occa&s;ionally, yet, as he a&s;&s;ured me, and I indeed perceived, able to &s;erve him very well, after a little recollection. It was agreeable to ob&s;erve, that he was free from the di&s;content and fretfulne&s;s which too often mole&s;t old age. He in the &s;ummer of this year walked to Rotherhithe, where he dined, and walked home in the evening.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Volumes would be required to contain a li&s;t of his numerous and various acquaintance, none of whom he ever forgot; and could de&s;cribe and di&s;cri|minate them all with preci&s;ion and vivacity. He a&s;&s;ociated with per&s;ons the mo&s;t widely different in manners, abilities, rank, and accompli&s;hments. He was at once the companion of the brilliant Colonel Forre&s;ter of the guards, who wrote <Q REND="inline">"The Polite Philo&s;opher,"</Q> and of the aukward and uncouth
<PB N="55" REF="56" MS="y">
Robert Levett; of Lord Thurlow, and Mr. Sa&s;tres, the Italian ma&s;ter; and  has dined one day with the beautiful, gay, and fa&s;cinating Lady Craven <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Lord Macartney, who with his other di&s;tingui&s;hed qualities, is remarkable al&s;o for an elegant plea&s;antry, told me, that he met John&s;on at Lady Craven's, and that he &s;eemed jealous of any interference; <Q REND="inline">"So (&s;aid his Lord&s;hip, &s;miling,) I kept back."</Q></NOTE>, and the next with good Mrs. Gardiner the tallow-chandler, on Snow-hill.</P>
<P>On my expre&s;&s;ing my wonder at his di&s;covering &s;o much of the knowledge peculiar to different profe&s;&s;ions, he told me, <Q REND="inline">"I learnt what I know of law, chiefly from Mr. Ballow, a very able man. I learnt &s;ome too from Chambers; but was not &s;o teachable then. One is not willing to be taught by a young man."</Q> When I expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to know more about Mr. Ballow, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I have &s;een him but once the&s;e twenty years. The tide of life has driven us different ways."</Q> I was &s;orry at the time to hear this; but whoever quits the creeks of private connections, and fairly gets into the great ocean of London, will, by imperceptible degrees, unavoidably experience this.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My knowledge of phy&s;ick, (he added,) I learnt from Dr. James, whom I helped in writing the propo&s;als for his Dictionary, and al&s;o a little in the Dictionary it&s;elf. I al&s;o learnt &s;ome from Dr. Lawrence, but was then grown more &s;tubborn."</Q></P>
<P>A curious incident happened to-day, while Mr. Thrale and I &s;at with him. Francis announced that a large packet was brought to him from the po&s;t-office, &s;aid to have come from Li&s;bon, and it was charged <HI>&s;even pounds ten &s;hillings.</HI> He would not receive it, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be &s;ome trick, nor did he even look at it. But upon enquiry afterwards he found that it was a real packet for him, from that very friend in the Ea&s;t-Indies of whom he had been &s;peak|ing; and the &s;hip which carried it having come to Portugal, this packet, with others, had been put into the po&s;t-office at Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>I mentioned a new gaming club, of which Mr. Beauclerk had given me an account, where the members played to a de&s;perate extent. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Depend upon it, Sir, this is mere talk. <HI>Who</HI> is ruined by gaming? You will not find &s;ix in&s;tances in an age. There is a &s;trange rout made about deep play; whereas you have many more people ruined by adventurous trade, and yet we do not hear &s;uch an outcry again&s;t it."</Q> THRALE. <Q REND="inline">"There may be few people ab&s;olutely ruined by deep play; but very many are much hurt in their circum&s;tances by it."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; and &s;o are very many by other kinds of expence."</Q> I had heard him talk once before in the &s;ame manner; and at Oxford he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"he wi&s;hed he had learnt to play at cards."</Q> The
<PB N="56" REF="57" MS="y">
 truth, however, is, that he loved to di&s;play his ingenuity in argument; and therefore would &s;ometimes in conver&s;ation maintain opinions which he was &s;en&s;ible were wrong, but in &s;upporting which, his rea&s;oning and wit would be mo&s;t con&s;picuous. He would begin thus: <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, as to the good or evil of card-playing&mdash;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Now (&s;aid Garrick,) he is thinking which &s;ide he &s;hall take."</Q> He appeared to have a plea&s;ure in contradiction, e&s;pecially when any opinion whatever was delivered with an air of confidence; &s;o that there was hardly any topick, if not one of the great truths of Religion and Morality, that he might not have been incited to argue, either for or again&s;t it. Lord Elibank <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Patrick Lord Elibank, who died 1778.</NOTE> had the highe&s;t admiration of his powers.

<P>We &s;at together till it was too late for the afternoon &s;ervice. Thrale &s;aid, he had come with intention to go to church with us. We went at &s;even to evening prayers at St. Clement's church, after having drank coffee; an indulgence, which I under&s;tood John&s;on yielded to on this occa&s;ion, in com|pliment to Thrale.</P>
<P>On Sunday, April 7, Ea&s;ter-day, after having been at St. Paul's cathedral, I came to Dr. John&s;on, according to my u&s;ual cu&s;tom. It &s;eemed to me, that there was always &s;omething peculiarly mild and placid in his manner upon this holy fe&s;tival, the commemoration of the mo&s;t joyful event in the hi&s;tory of our world, the re&s;urrection of our LORD and SAVIOUR, who, having triumphed over death and the grave, proclaimed immortality to mankind.</P>
<P>I repeated to him an argument of a lady of my acquaintance, who main|tained, that her hu&s;band's having been guilty of numberle&s;s infidelities, relea&s;ed her from conjugal obligations, becau&s;e they were reciprocal. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"This is mi&s;erable &s;tuff, Sir. To the contract of marriage, be&s;ides the man and wife, there is a third party&mdash;Society; and, if it be con&s;idered as a vow&mdash;GOD: and, therefore, it cannot be di&s;&s;olved by their con&s;ent alone. Laws are not made for particular ca&s;es, but for mankind in general. A woman may be unhappy with her hu&s;band; but &s;he cannot be freed from him without the approbation of the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical power. A man may be unhappy, becau&s;e he is not &s;o rich as another; but he is not to &s;eize upon another's property with his own hand."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, this lady does not want
<PB N="57" REF="58" MS="y">
that the contract &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved; &s;he only argues that &s;he may indulge  her&s;elf in gallantries with equal freedom as her hu&s;band does, provided &s;he takes care not to introduce a &s;purious i&s;&s;ue into his family. You know, Sir, what Macrobius has told us of Julia <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Nunquam enim ni&s;i uavi plen&acirc; tollo vectorem."</Q> <HI>Lib. ii. c. vi.</HI></NOTE>."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"This lady of yours, Sir, I think, is very fit for a brothel."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Macbean, authour of the <Q REND="inline">"Dictionary of ancient Geography,"</Q> came in. He mentioned, that he had been forty years ab&s;ent from Scotland. <Q REND="inline">"Ah, Bo&s;well! (&s;aid John&s;on, &s;miling,) what would you give to be forty years from Scotland?"</Q> I &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould not like to be &s;o long ab&s;ent from the &s;eat of my ance&s;tors."</Q> This gentleman, Mrs. Williams, and Mr. Levett, dined with us.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on made a remark, which both Mr. Macbean and I thought new. It was this: that <Q REND="inline">"the law again&s;t u&s;ury is for the protection of creditors as well as of debtors; for if there were no &s;uch check, people would be apt, from the temptation of great intere&s;t, to lend to de&s;perate per&s;ons, by whom they would lo&s;e their money. Accordingly there are in&s;tances of ladies being ruined, by having injudiciou&s;ly &s;unk their fortunes for high annuities, which, after a few years, cea&s;ed to be paid, in con&s;equence of the ruined circum&s;tances of the borrower."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Williams was very peevi&s;h; and I wondered at John&s;on's patience with her now, as I had often done on &s;imilar occa&s;ions. The truth is, that his humane con&s;ideration of the forlorn and indigent &s;tate in which this lady was left by her father, induced him to treat her with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, and even to be de&s;irous of procuring her amu&s;ement, &s;o as &s;ometimes to incommode many of his friends, by carrying her with him to their hou&s;es, where, from her manner of eating, in con&s;equence of her blindne&s;s, &s;he could not but offend the delicacy of per&s;ons of nice &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>After coffee, we went to afternoon &s;ervice in St. Clement's church. Ob&s;erving &s;ome beggars in the &s;treet as we walked along, I &s;aid to him I &s;uppo&s;ed there was no civili&s;ed country in the world, where the mi&s;ery of want in the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of the people was prevented. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I believe, Sir, there is not; but it is better that &s;ome &s;hould be unhappy, than that none &s;hould be happy, which would be the ca&s;e in a general &s;tate of equality."</Q></P>
<P>When the &s;ervice was ended, I went home with him, and we &s;at quietly by our&s;elves. He recommended Dr. Cheyne's books. I &s;aid, I thought Cheyne
<PB N="58" REF="59" MS="y">
 had been reckoned whim&s;ical.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"So he was, (&s;aid he,) in &s;ome things; but there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s no end of objections. There are few books to which &s;ome objection or other may not be made."</Q></P>
<P>Upon the que&s;tion whether a man who had been guilty of vicious actions would do well to force him&s;elf into &s;olitude and &s;adne&s;s; JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, unle&s;s it prevent him from being vicious again. With &s;ome people, gloomy penitence is only madne&s;s turned up&s;ide down. A man may be gloomy, till, in order to be relieved from gloom, he has recour&s;e again to criminal indulgences."</Q></P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, April 10, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale's, where were Mr. Murphy and &s;ome other company. Before dinner, Dr. John&s;on and I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time by our&s;elves. I was &s;orry to find it was now re&s;olved that the propo&s;ed journey to Italy &s;hould not take place this year. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am di&s;appointed, to be &s;ure; but it is not a great di&s;appointment."</Q> I wondered to &s;ee him bear, with a philo&s;ophical calmne&s;s, what would have made mo&s;t people peevi&s;h and fretful. I perceived, however, that he had &s;o warmly cheri&s;hed the hope of enjoying cla&s;&s;ical &s;cenes, that he could not ea&s;ily part with the &s;cheme; for he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall probably contrive to get to Italy &s;ome other way. But I won't mention it to Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, as it might vex them."</Q> I &s;ugge&s;ted, that going to Italy might have done Mr. and Mrs. Thrale good. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I rather believe not, Sir. While grief is fre&s;h, every attempt to divert only irritates. You mu&s;t wait till grief be <HI>dige&s;ted,</HI> and then amu&s;ement will di&s;&s;ipate the remains of it."</Q></P>
<P>At dinner, Mr. Murphy entertained us with the hi&s;tory of Mr. Jo&s;eph Simp&s;on, a &s;choolfellow of Dr. John&s;on's, a barri&s;ter at law, of good parts, but who fell into a di&s;&s;ipated cour&s;e of life, incompatible with that &s;ucce&s;s in his profe&s;&s;ion which he once had, and would otherwi&s;e have de&s;ervedly main|tained; yet he &s;till pre&s;erved a dignity in his deportment. He wrote a tragedy on the &s;tory of Leonidas, entitled <Q REND="inline">"The Patriot,"</Q> He read it to a company of lawyers, who found &s;o many faults, that he wrote it over again: &s;o then there were two tragedies on the &s;ame &s;ubject, and with the &s;ame title. Dr. John&s;on told us, that one of them was &s;till in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This very piece was, after his death, publi&s;hed by &s;ome per&s;on who had been about him, and, for the &s;ake of a little ha&s;ty profit, was po&s;itively averred to have been written by John&s;on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I di&s;liked the cu&s;tom which &s;ome people had of bringing their children into company, becau&s;e it in a manner forced us to pay fooli&s;h com|pliments to plea&s;e their parents. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"You are right, Sir. We may be excu&s;ed for not caring much about other people's children, for there are
<PB N="59" REF="60" MS="y">
many who care very little about their own children. It may be ob&s;erved,  that men, who from being engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s, or from their cour&s;e of life in whatever way, &s;eldom &s;ee their children, do not care much about them. I my&s;elf &s;hould not have had much fondne&s;s for a child of my own."</Q> MRS. THRALE. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, how can you talk &s;o?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"At lea&s;t, I never wi&s;hed to have a child."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Murphy mentioned Dr. John&s;on's having a de&s;ign to publi&s;h an edition of Cowley. John&s;on &s;aid, he did not know but he &s;hould; and he expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;approbation of Dr. Hurd, for having publi&s;hed a mutilated edition under the title of <Q REND="inline">"Select Works of Abraham Cowley."</Q> Mr. Murphy thought it a bad precedent; ob&s;erving, that any authour might be u&s;ed in the &s;ame manner; and that it was plea&s;ing to &s;ee the variety of an authour's compo|&s;itions, at different periods.</P>
<P>We talked of Flatman's Poems; and Mrs. Thrale ob&s;erved, that Pope had partly borrowed from him, <Q REND="inline">"The dying Chri&s;tian to his Soul."</Q> John&s;on re|peated Roche&s;ter's ver&s;es upon Flatman, which, I think, by much too &s;evere:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Nor that &s;low drudge in &s;wift Pindarick &s;trains,</L>
<L>"Flatman, who Cowley imitates with pains,</L>
<L>"And rides a jaded Mu&s;e, whipt with loo&s;e reins."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>I like to recollect all the pa&s;&s;ages that I heard John&s;on repeat: it &s;tamps a value on them.</P>
<P>He told us, that the book entitled <Q REND="inline">"The Lives of the Poets, by Mr. Cibber,"</Q> was entirely compiled by Mr. Shiels, a Scotchman, one of his amanuen&s;es. <Q REND="inline">"The book&s;ellers (&s;aid he,) gave Theophilus Cibber, who was then in pri&s;on, ten guineas, to allow <HI>Mr. Cibber</HI> to be put upon the title-page, as the authour; by this, a double impo&s;ition was intended: in the fir&s;t place, that it was the work of a Cibber at all; and, in the &s;econd place, that it was the work of old Cibber."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Murphy &s;aid, that <Q REND="inline">"The Memoirs of Gray's Life &s;et him much higher in his e&s;timation than his poems did; for you there &s;aw a man con|&s;tantly at work in literature."</Q> John&s;on acquie&s;ced in this, but depreciated the book, I thought, very unrea&s;onably. For he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I forced my&s;elf to read it, only becau&s;e it was a common topick of conver&s;ation. I found it mighty dull; and, as to the &s;tyle, it is fit for the &s;econd table."</Q> Why he thought &s;o, I was at a lo&s;s to conceive. He now gave it as his opinion, that <Q REND="inline">"Aken&s;ide was a &s;uperiour poet both to Gray and Ma&s;on."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61" MS="y">
 Talking of the Reviews, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I think them very impartial: I do not know an in&s;tance of partiality."</Q> He mentioned what had pa&s;&s;ed upon the &s;ubject of the Monthly and Critical Reviews, in the conver&s;ation with which his Maje&s;ty had honoured him. He expatiated a little more on them this evening. <Q REND="inline">"The Monthly Reviewers (&s;aid he) are not Dei&s;ts; but they are Chri&s;tians with as little chri&s;tianity as may be; and are for pulling down all e&s;tabli&s;hments. The Critical Reviewers are for &s;upporting the con|&s;titution, both in church and &s;tate. The Critical Reviewers, I believe, often review without reading the books through; but lay hold of a topick, and write chiefly from their own minds. The Monthly Reviewers are duller men, and are glad to read the books through."</Q></P>
<P>He talked of Lord Lyttelton's extreme anxiety as an authour; ob&s;erving, that <Q REND="inline">"he was thirty years in preparing his Hi&s;tory, and that he employed a man to point it for him; as if (laughing) another man could point his &s;en&s;e better than him&s;elf."</Q> Mr. Murphy &s;aid, he under&s;tood his Hi&s;tory was kept back &s;everal years for fear of Smollet. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"This &s;eems &s;trange to Murphy and me, who never felt that anxiety, but &s;ent what we wrote to the pre&s;s, and let it take its chance."</Q> MRS. THRALE. <Q REND="inline">"The time has been, Sir, when you felt it."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why really, Madam, I do not recollect a time when that was the ca&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of <Q REND="inline">"The Spectator,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It is wonderful that there is &s;uch a proportion of bad papers, in the half of the work which was not written by Addi&s;on; for there was all the world to write that half, yet not a half of that half is good. One of the fine&s;t pieces in the Engli&s;h language is the paper on Novelty, yet we do not hear it talked of. It was written by Grove, a di&s;&s;ent|ing <HI>teacher.</HI>"</Q> He would not, I perceived, call him a <HI>clergyman,</HI> though he was candid enough to allow very great merit to his compo&s;ition. Mr. Murphy &s;aid, he remembered when there were &s;everal people alive in London, who enjoyed a con&s;iderable reputation merely from having written a paper in <Q REND="inline">"The Spectator."</Q> He mentioned particularly Mr. Ince, who u&s;ed to frequent Tom's coffee-hou&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"But (&s;aid John&s;on,) you mu&s;t con&s;ider how highly Steele &s;peaks of Mr. Ince."</Q> He would not allow that the paper on carrying a boy to travel, &s;igned <HI>Philip Homebred,</HI> which was written by the Lord Chancellor Hardwick, had merit. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"it was quite vulgar, and had nothing luminous."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on mentioned Dr. Barry's <Q REND="inline">"Sy&s;tem of Phy&s;ick."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"He was a man (&s;aid he,) who had acquired a high reputation in Dublin, came over to Eng|land, and brought his reputation with him, but had not great &s;ucce&s;s. His notion
<PB N="61" REF="62" MS="y">
was, that pul&s;ation occa&s;ions death by attrition; and that, therefore, the way  to pre&s;erve life is to retard pul&s;ation. But we know that pul&s;ation is &s;tronge&s;t in infants, and that we increa&s;e in growth while it operates in its regular cour&s;e; &s;o it cannot be the cau&s;e of de&s;truction."</Q> Soon after this, he &s;aid &s;omething very flattering to Mrs. Thrale, which I do not recollect; but it concluded with wi&s;hing her long life. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid I,) if Dr. Barry's &s;y&s;tem be true, you have now &s;hortened Mrs. Thrale's life, perhaps, &s;ome minutes, by accelerating her pul&s;ation."</Q></P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, April 11, I dined with him at General Paoli's, in who&s;e hou&s;e I now re&s;ided, and where I had ever afterwards the honour of being enter|tained with the kinde&s;t attention as his con&s;tant gue&s;t, while I was in London, till I had a hou&s;e of my own there. I mentioned my having that morning introduced to Mr. Garrick, Count Neni, a Flemi&s;h nobleman of great rank and fortune, to whom Garrick talked of Abel Drugger as <HI>a &s;mall part;</HI> and related, with plea&s;ant vanity, that a Frenchman who had &s;een him in one of his low characters, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Comment! je ne le crois pas. Ce n'e&s;t pas, Mon&s;ieur Garrick, ce Grand Homme!"</Q> Garrick added, with an appearance of grave recollection, <Q REND="inline">"If I were to begin life again, I think I &s;hould not play tho&s;e low characters."</Q> Upon which I ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you would be in the wrong; for your great excellence is your variety of playing, your repre&s;enting &s;o well, characters &s;o very different.</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Garrick, Sir, was not in earne&s;t in what he &s;aid; for, to be &s;ure, his peculiar excellence is his variety: and, perhaps, there is not any one character which has not been as well acted by &s;omebody el&s;e, as he could do it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Why then, Sir, did he talk &s;o?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, to make you an&s;wer as you did."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I don't know, Sir; he &s;eemed to dip deep into his mind for the reflection."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"He had not far to dip, Sir: he had &s;aid the &s;ame thing, probably, twenty times before."</Q></P>
<P>Of a nobleman rai&s;ed at a very early period to high office, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"His parts, Sir, are pretty well for a Lord, but would not be di&s;tingui&s;hed in a man who had nothing el&s;e but his parts."</Q></P>
<P>A journey to Italy was &s;till in his thoughts. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"A man who has not been in Italy, is always con&s;cious of an inferiority,&mdash;from his not having &s;een what it is expected a man &s;hould &s;ee. The grand object of travelling is to &s;ee the &s;hores of the Mediterrannean. On tho&s;e &s;hores were the four great empires of the world; the A&s;&s;yrian, the Per&s;ian, the Grecian, and the Roman.&mdash;All our religion, almo&s;t all our law, almo&s;t all our arts, almo&s;t all that &s;ets us above &s;avages, has come to us from the &s;hores of the Mediter|ranean."</Q>
<PB N="62" REF="63" MS="y">
 The General ob&s;erved, that <Q REND="inline">"THE MEDITERRANEAN would be a noble &s;ubject for a poem."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of tran&s;lation. I &s;aid, I could not define it, nor could I think of a &s;imilitude to illu&s;trate it; but that it appeared to me the tran&s;lation of poetry could be only imitation. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"You may tran&s;late books of &s;cience exactly. You may al&s;o tran&s;late hi&s;tory, in &s;o far as it is not embel|li&s;hed with oratory, which is poetical. Poetry, indeed, cannot be tran&s;lated; and, therefore, it is the poets that pre&s;erve languages; for we would not be at the trouble to learn a language, if we could have all that is written in it ju&s;t as well in a tran&s;lation. But as the beauties of poetry cannot be pre&s;erved in any language except that in which it was originally written, we learn the language."</Q></P>
<P>A gentleman maintained that the art of printing had hurt real learning, by di&s;&s;eminating idle writings.&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if it had not been for the art of printing, we &s;hould now have no learning at all; for books would have peri&s;hed fa&s;ter than they could have been tran&s;cribed."</Q> This ob&s;ervation &s;eems not ju&s;t, con&s;idering for how many ages books were pre&s;erved by writing alone.</P>
<P>The &s;ame gentleman maintained, that a general diffu&s;ion of knowledge among a people was a di&s;advantage; for it made the vulgar ri&s;e above their humble &s;phere. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, while knowledge is a di&s;tinction, tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it will naturally ri&s;e above tho&s;e who are not. Merely to read and write was a di&s;tinction at fir&s;t; but we &s;ee when reading and writing have become general, the common people keep their &s;tations. And &s;o, were higher attainments to become general, the effect would be the &s;ame."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Gold&s;mith (he &s;aid,) referred every thing to vanity; his virtues, and his vices too, were from that motive. He was not a &s;ocial man. He never exchanged mind with you."</Q></P>
<P>We &s;pent the evening at Mr. Hoole's. Mr. Mickle, the excellent tran&s;lator of <Q REND="inline">"The Lu&s;iad,"</Q> was there. I have pre&s;erved little of the conver&s;ation of this evening. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Thom&s;on had a true poetical genius, the power of viewing every thing in a poetical light. His fault is &s;uch a cloud of words &s;ometimes, that the &s;en&s;e can hardly peep through. Shiels, who com|piled 'Cibber's Lives of the Poets,' was one day &s;itting with me. I took down Thom&s;on, and read aloud a large portion of him, and then a&s;ked,&mdash;Is not this fine? Shiels having expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t admiration. Well, Sir, (&s;aid I,) I have omitted every other line."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64" MS="y">
I related a di&s;pute between Gold&s;mith and Mr. Robert Dod&s;ley, one day  when they and I were dining at Tom Davies's, in 1762. Gold&s;mith a&s;&s;erted, that there was no poetry produced in this age. Dod&s;ley appealed to his own Collection, and maintained, that though you could not find a Palace like Dryden's <Q REND="inline">"Ode on St. Cecilia's Day,"</Q> you had villages compo&s;ed of very pretty hou&s;es; and he mentioned particularly <Q REND="inline">"The Spleen."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I think Dod&s;ley gave up the que&s;tion. He and Gold&s;mith &s;aid the &s;ame thing; only he &s;aid it in a &s;ofter manner than Gold&s;mith did: for he acknowledged that there was no poetry, nothing that towered above the common mark. You may find wit and humour in ver&s;e, and yet no poetry. 'Hudibras' has a profu&s;ion of the&s;e; yet it is not to be reckoned a poem. 'The Spleen,' in Dod&s;ley's collection, on which you &s;ay he chiefly re&s;ted, is not poetry."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Does not Gray's poetry, Sir, tower above the common mark?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; but we mu&s;t attend to the difference between what men in general cannot do if they would, and what every man may do if he would. Sixteen-&s;tring Jack towered above the common mark."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, what is poetry?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, it is much ea&s;ier to &s;ay what it is not. We all <HI>know</HI> what light is; but it is not ea&s;y to <HI>tell</HI> what it is."</Q></P>
<P>On Friday, April 12, I dined with him at our friend Tom Davies's, where we met Mr. Cradock, a Leice&s;ter&s;hire gentleman, authour of <Q REND="inline">"Zobeide,"</Q> a tragedy; and Dr. Harwood, who has written and publi&s;hed various works.</P>
<P>I introduced Ari&s;totle's doctrine in his <Q REND="inline">"Art of Poetry,"</Q> of <Q REND="inline">"the <GAP DESC="foreign">, the purging of the pa&s;&s;ions,"</Q> as the purpo&s;e of tragedy. <Q REND="inline">"But how are the pa&s;&s;ions to be purged by terrour and pity?"</Q> (&s;aid I, with an a&s;&s;umed air of ignorance, to incite him to talk, for which it was often nece&s;|&s;ary to employ &s;ome addre&s;s). JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, you are to con&s;ider what is the meaning of purging in the original &s;en&s;e. It is to expel impuri|ties from the human body. The mind is &s;ubject to the &s;ame imperfection. The pa&s;&s;ions are the great movers of human actions; but they are mixed with &s;uch impurities, that it is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be purged or refined by means of terrour and pity. For in&s;tance, ambition is a noble pa&s;&s;ion; but by &s;ee|ing upon the &s;tage, that a man who is &s;o exce&s;&s;ively ambitious as to rai&s;e him&s;elf by inju&s;tice, is puni&s;hed, we are terrified at the fatal con&s;equences of &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion. In the &s;ame manner a certain degree of re&s;entment is nece&s;|&s;ary; but if we &s;ee that a man carries it too far, we pity the object of it, and are taught to moderate that pa&s;&s;ion."</Q> My record upon this occa&s;ion does great inju&s;tice to John&s;on's expre&s;&s;ion, which was &s;o forcible and brilliant, that Mr. Cradock whi&s;pered me, <Q REND="inline">"O that his words were written in a book!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="65" MS="y">
 I ob&s;erved the great defect of the tragedy of <Q REND="inline">"Othello"</Q> was, that it had not a moral, for that no man could re&s;i&s;t the circum&s;tances of &s;u&s;picion which were artfully &s;ugge&s;ted to Othello's mind. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"In the fir&s;t place, Sir, we learn from Othello this very u&s;eful moral, not to make an unequal match; in the &s;econd place, we learn not to yield too readily to &s;u&s;picion. The handkerchief is merely a trick, though a very pretty trick; but there are no other circum&s;tances of rea&s;onable &s;u&s;picion, except what is related by Iago of Ca&s;&s;io's warm expre&s;&s;ions concerning De&s;demona in his &s;leep; and that depended entirely upon the a&s;&s;ertion of one man. No, Sir, I think Othello has more moral than almo&s;t any play."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of a penurious gentleman of our acquaintance, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he is narrow, not &s;o much from avarice, as from impotence to &s;pend his money. He cannot find in his heart to pour out a bottle of wine; but he would not much care if it &s;hould &s;our."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, he wi&s;hed to &s;ee <Q REND="inline">"John Dennis's Critical Works"</Q> collected. Davies &s;aid they would not &s;ell. Dr. John&s;on &s;eemed to think otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Davies &s;aid of a well known dramatick authour, that <Q REND="inline">"he lived upon <HI>potted &s;tories,</HI> and that he made his way as Hannibal did, by vinegar; having begun by attacking people; particularly the players."</Q></P>
<P>He reminded Dr. John&s;on of Mr. Murphy's having paid him the highe&s;t compliment that ever was paid to a layman, by a&s;king his pardon for repeat|ing &s;ome oaths in the cour&s;e of telling a &s;tory.</P>
<P>John&s;on and I &s;upt this evening at the Crown and Anchor tavern, in com|pany with Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Mr. Langton, Mr. Nairne, now one of the Scotch Judges, with the title of Lord Dun&s;inan, and my very worthy friend, Sir William Forbes, of Pit&s;ligo.</P>
<P>We di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the que&s;tion whether drinking improved conver&s;ation and benevolence. Sir Jo&s;hua maintained it did. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir: before dinner men meet with great inequality of under&s;tanding; and tho&s;e who are con&s;cious of their inferiority, have the mode&s;ty not to talk. When they have drunk wine, every man feels him&s;elf happy, and lo&s;es that mode&s;ty, and grows impudent and vociferous: but he is not improved; he is only not &s;en&s;ible of his defects."</Q> Sir Jo&s;hua &s;aid that the Doctor was talking of the effects of exce&s;s in wine; but that a moderate gla&s;s enlivened the mind, by giving a proper circulation to the blood. <Q REND="inline">"I am (&s;aid he,) in very good &s;pirits when I get up in the morning. By dinner-time I am exhau&s;ted; wine puts me in the &s;ame &s;tate as when I got up; and I am &s;ure that moderate
<PB N="65" REF="66" MS="y">
drinking makes people talk better."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; wine gives not  light, gay, ideal hilarity; but tumultuous, noi&s;y, clamourous merriment. I have heard none of tho&s;e drunken,&mdash;nay, drunken is a coar&s;e word,&mdash;none of tho&s;e <HI>vinous</HI> flights."</Q> SIR JOSHUA. <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e you have &s;at by, quite &s;ober, and felt an envy of the happine&s;s of tho&s;e who were drinking."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Perhaps, contempt.&mdash;And, Sir, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to be drunk one's &s;elf, to reli&s;h the wit of drunkenne&s;s. Do we not judge of the drunken wit of the dialogue between Iago and Ca&s;&s;io, the mo&s;t excellent in its kind, when we are quite &s;ober? Wit is wit, by whatever means it is produced; and, if good, will appear &s;o at all times. I admit that the &s;pirits are rai&s;ed by drinking, as by the common participation of any plea&s;ure; cock-fighting, or bear-baiting, will rai&s;e the &s;pirits of a company as drinking does, though &s;urely they will not improve conver&s;ation. I al&s;o admit, that there are &s;ome &s;luggi&s;h men who are improved by drinking, as there are fruits which are not good till they are rotten. There are &s;uch men, but they are medlars. I indeed allow that there have been a very few men of talents who were improved by drinking; but I maintain that I am right as to the effects of drinking in general: and let it be con&s;idered, that there is no po&s;ition, however fal&s;e in its univer&s;ality, which is not true of &s;ome particular man."</Q> Sir William Forbes &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Might not a man warmed with wine be like a bottle of beer, which is made bri&s;ker by being &s;et before the fire?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Nay, (&s;aid John&s;on, laughing,) I cannot an&s;wer that: that is too much for me."</Q></P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, that wine did &s;ome people harm, by inflaming, confu&s;ing, and irritating their minds; but that the experience of mankind had declared in favour of moderate drinking. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I do not &s;ay it is wrong to produce &s;elf-complacency by drinking; I only deny that it improves the mind. When I drank wine, I &s;corned to drink it when in company. I have drunk many a bottle by my&s;elf: in the fir&s;t place, becau&s;e I had need of it to rai&s;e my &s;pirits; in the &s;econd place, becau&s;e I would have nobody to witne&s;s its effects upon me."</Q></P>
<P>He told us, <Q REND="inline">"almo&s;t all his Ramblers were written ju&s;t as they were wanted for the pre&s;s; that he &s;ent a certain portion of the copy of an e&s;&s;ay, and wrote the remainder, while the former part of it was printing. When it was wanted, and he had fairly &s;at down to it, he was &s;ure it would be done."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, that for general improvement, a man &s;hould read whatever his im|mediate inclination prompts him to; though, to be &s;ure, if a man has a &s;cience to learn, he mu&s;t regularly and re&s;olutely advance. He added, <Q REND="inline">"what we read with inclination makes a much &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion. If we read without
<PB N="66" REF="67">
 inclination, half the mind is employed in fixing the attention; &s;o there is but one half to be employed on what we read."</Q> He told us, he read Fielding's <Q REND="inline">"Amelia"</Q> through without &s;topping <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">We have here an involuntary te&s;timony to the excellence of this admirable writer, to whom we have &s;een that Dr. John&s;on <HI>directly</HI> allowed &s;o little merit.</NOTE>.

<P>Sir Jo&s;hua mentioned Mr. Cumberland's Odes, which were ju&s;t publi&s;hed.

<P>Soon after this day, he went to Bath with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale. I had never &s;een that beautiful city, and wi&s;hed to take the opportunity of vi&s;iting it, while John&s;on was there. Having written to him, I received the following an&s;wer:

<P>WHY do you talk of neglect? When did I neglect you? If you will come to Bath, we &s;hall all be glad to &s;ee you. Come, therefore, as &s;oon as you can.</P>
<P>But I have a little bu&s;ine&s;s for you at London. Bid Francis look in the paper-drawer of the che&s;t of drawers in my bed-chamber, for two ca&s;es; one for the Attorney-General, and one for the Solicitor-General. They lie, I think, at the top of my papers; otherwi&s;e they are &s;omewhere el&s;e, and will give me more trouble.</P>

Plea&s;e to write me immediately, if they can be found. Make my com|pliments  to all our friends round the world, and to Mrs. Williams at home.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>On the 26th of April, I went to Bath; and on my arrival at the Pelican inn, found lying for me an obliging invitation from Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, by whom I was agreeably entertained almo&s;t con&s;tantly during my &s;tay. They were gone to the rooms; but there was a kind note from Dr. John&s;on, that he &s;hould &s;it at home all the evening. I went to him directly, and before Mr. and Mrs. Thrale returned, we had by our&s;elves &s;ome hours of tea-drinking and talk.</P>
<P>I &s;hall groupe together &s;uch of his &s;ayings as I pre&s;erved during the few days that I was at Bath.</P>
<P>Of a per&s;on who differed from him in politicks, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"In private life he is a very hone&s;t gentleman; but I will not allow him to be &s;o in publick life. People <HI>may</HI> be hone&s;t, though they are doing wrong: that is between their Maker and them. But <HI>we,</HI> who are &s;uffering by their pernicious conduct, are to de&s;troy them. We are &s;ure that&mdash;acts from intere&s;t. We know what his genuine principles were. They who allow their pa&s;&s;ions to confound the di&s;tinctions between right and wrong, are criminal. They may be convinced; but they have not come hone&s;tly by their conviction."</Q></P>
<P>It having been mentioned, I know not with what truth, that a certain female political writer, who&s;e doctrines he di&s;liked, had of late become very fond of dre&s;s, &s;at hours together at her toilet, and even put on rouge;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"She is better employed at her toilet than u&s;ing her pen. It is better &s;he &s;hould be reddening her own cheeks, than blackening other people's characters."</Q></P>
<P>He told us that <Q REND="inline">"Addi&s;on wrote Budgell's papers in the Spectator, at lea&s;t mended them &s;o much, that he made them almo&s;t all his own; and that Draper, Ton&s;on's partner, a&s;&s;ured Mrs. John&s;on, that the much admired Epilogue to 'The Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mother,' which came out in Budgell's name, was in reality written by Addi&s;on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The mode of government by one may be ill adapted to a &s;mall &s;ociety, but is be&s;t for a great nation. The characteri&s;tick of our own government at pre&s;ent is imbecillity. The magi&s;trate dare not call the guards for fear of
<PB N="68" REF="69" MS="y">
 being hanged. The guards will not come, for fear of being given up to the blind rage of popular juries."</Q></P>
<P>Of the father of one of our friends, he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"He never clarified his notions, by filtrating them through other minds. He had a canal upon his e&s;tate, where at one place the bank was too low.&mdash;I dug the canal deeper,"</Q> &s;aid he.</P>
<P>He told me that <Q REND="inline">"&s;o long ago as 1748, he had read 'The Grave, a Poem <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">I am &s;orry that there are no memoirs of the Reverend Robert Blair, the authour of this poem. He was the repre&s;entative of the ancient family of Blair, of Blair in Ayr&s;hire, but the e&s;tate had de&s;cended to a female, and afterwards pa&s;&s;ed to the &s;on of her hu&s;band by another mar|riage. He was mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h of Athel&s;taneford, where Mr. John Home was his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; &s;o that it may be truly called cla&s;&s;ick ground. His &s;on, who is of the &s;ame name, and a man emi|nent for talents and learning, is now, with univer&s;al approbation, Solicitor-General of Scotland.</NOTE>,' but did not like it much."</Q> I differed from him; for though it is not equal throughout, and is &s;eldom elegantly correct, it abounds in &s;olemn thought, and poetical imagery beyond the common reach. The world has differed from him; for the poem has pa&s;&s;ed through many editions, and is &s;till much read by people of a &s;erious ca&s;t of mind.</P>
<P>A literary lady of large fortune was mentioned, as one who did good to many, but by no means <Q REND="inline">"by &s;tealth,"</Q> and in&s;tead of <Q REND="inline">"blu&s;hing to find it fame,"</Q> acted evidently from vanity. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I have &s;een no beings who do as much good from benevolence, as &s;he does, from whatever motive. If there are &s;uch under the earth, or in the clouds, I wi&s;h they would come|up, or come down. What Soame Jennyns &s;ays upon this &s;ubject is not to be minded; he is a wit. No, Sir, to act from pure benevolence is not po&s;&s;ible for finite beings. Human benevolence is mingled with vanity, intere&s;t, or &s;ome other motive."</Q></P>
<P>He would not allow me to prai&s;e a lady then at Bath; ob&s;erving, <Q REND="inline">"She does not gain upon me, Sir; I think her empty-headed."</Q> He was, indeed, a &s;tern critick upon characters and manners. Even Mrs. Thrale did not e&s;cape his friendly animadver&s;ion at times. When he and I were one day endeavouring to a&s;certain article by article, how one of our friends could po&s;&s;ibly &s;pend as much money in his family as he told us he did, &s;he interrupted us with a lively extravagant &s;ally, on the expence of clothing his children, de&s;cribing it in a very ludicrous and fanciful manner. John&s;on looked a little angry, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Madam, when you are declaiming, declaim; and when you are calculating, calculate."</Q> At another time, when &s;he &s;aid, perhaps affectedly, <Q REND="inline">"I don't like to fly."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"With <HI>your</HI> wings, Madam,
<PB N="69" REF="70" MS="y">
you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> fly: but have a care, there are <HI>clippers</HI> abroad."</Q> How very well  was this &s;aid, and how fully has experience proved the truth of it! But have they not <HI>clipped</HI> rather <HI>rudely,</HI> and gone a great deal <HI>clo&s;er</HI> than was nece&s;&s;ary?</P>
<P>A gentleman expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to go and live three years at Otaheite, or New-Zealand, in order to obtain a full acquaintance with people, &s;o totally different from all that we have ever known, and be &s;atisfied what pure nature can do for man. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"What could you learn, Sir? What can &s;avages tell, but what they them&s;elves have &s;een? Of the pa&s;t, or the invi&s;ible, they can tell nothing. The inhabitants of Otaheite and New-Zealand are not in a &s;tate of pure nature; for it is plain they broke off from &s;ome other people. Had they grown out of the ground, you might have judged of a &s;tate of pure nature. Fanciful people may talk of a mythology being among&s;t them, but it mu&s;t be invention. They have once had religion, which has been gradually deba&s;ed. And what account of their religion can you &s;uppo&s;e to be learnt from &s;avages? Only con&s;ider, Sir, our own &s;tate: Our religion is in a book; we have an order of men who&s;e duty it is to teach it; we have one day in the week &s;et apart for it, and this in general pretty well ob&s;erved: Yet a&s;k the fir&s;t ten gro&s;s men you meet, and hear what they can tell of their religion."</Q></P>
<P>On Monday, April 29, he and I made an excur&s;ion to Bri&s;tol, where I was entertained with &s;eeing him inquire upon the &s;pot, into the authenticity of <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Rowley's</HI> Poetry,"</Q> as I had &s;een him inquire upon the &s;pot into the authenticity of <Q REND="inline">"<HI>O&s;&s;ian's</HI> Poetry."</Q> George Catcot, the pewterer, who was as zealous for Rowley, as Dr. Hugh Blair was for O&s;&s;ian, (I tru&s;t my Reve|rend friend will excu&s;e the compari&s;on,) attended us at our inn, and with a triumphant air of lively &s;implicity called out, <Q REND="inline">"I'll make Dr. John&s;on a convert."</Q> Dr. John&s;on, at his de&s;ire, read aloud &s;ome of Chatterton's fabri|cated ver&s;es, while Catcot &s;tood at the back of his chair, moving him&s;elf like a pendulum, and beating time with his feet, and now and then looking into Dr. John&s;on's face, wondering that he was not yet convinced. We called on Mr. Barret, the &s;urgeon, and &s;aw &s;ome of the <HI>originals</HI> as they were called, which were executed very artificially; but from a careful in&s;pection of them, and a con&s;ideration of the circum&s;tances with which they were attended, we were quite &s;atisfied of the impo&s;ture, which, indeed, has been clearly demon|&s;trated from internal evidence, by &s;everal able criticks <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Mr. Tyrwhitt, Mr. Warton, Mr. Malone.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71" MS="y">
 Hone&s;t Catcot &s;eemed to pay no attention whatever to any objections, but in&s;i&s;ted, as an end of all controver&s;y, that we &s;hould go with him to the tower of the church of St. Mary, Redcliff, and <HI>view with our own eyes</HI> the ancient che&s;t in which the manu&s;cripts were found. To this, Dr. John&s;on good|naturedly agreed; and though troubled with a &s;hortne&s;s of breathing, laboured up a long flight of &s;teps, till we came to the place where the wondrous che&s;t &s;tood. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>There,</HI> (&s;aid Catcot, with a bouncing confident credulity,) <HI>there</HI> is the very che&s;t it&s;elf."</Q> After this <HI>ocular demon&s;tration,</HI> there was no more to be &s;aid. He brought to my recollection a Scotch Highlander, a man of learning too, and who had &s;een the world, atte&s;ting, and at the &s;ame time giving his rea&s;ons for the authenticity of Fingal:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have heard all that poem when I was young."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Have you, Sir? Pray what have you heard?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have heard O&s;&s;ian, O&s;car, and <HI>every one of them.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on &s;aid of Chatterton, <Q REND="inline">"This is the mo&s;t extraordinary young man that has encountered my knowledge. It is wonderful how the whelp has written &s;uch things."</Q></P>
<P>We were by no means plea&s;ed with our inn at Bri&s;tol. <Q REND="inline">"Let us &s;ee now, (&s;aid I,) how we &s;hould de&s;cribe it."</Q> John&s;on was ready with his raillery. <Q REND="inline">"De&s;cribe it, Sir?&mdash;Why, it was &s;o bad that Bo&s;well wi&s;hed to be in Scotland!"</Q></P>
<P>After Dr. John&s;on's return to London, I was &s;everal times with him at his hou&s;e, where I occa&s;ionally &s;lept, in the room that had been a&s;&s;igned to me. I dined with him at Dr. Taylor's, at General Oglethorpe's, and at General Paoli's. To avoid a tedious minutene&s;s, I &s;hall groupe together what I have pre&s;erved of his conver&s;ation during this period al&s;o, without &s;pecifying each &s;cene where it pa&s;&s;ed, except one, which will be found &s;o remarkable as cer|tainly to de&s;erve a very particular relation. Where the place or the per&s;ons do not contribute to the ze&s;t of the conver&s;ation, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to encumber my page with mentioning them. To know of what vintage our wine is, enables us to judge of its value, and to drink it with more reli&s;h: but to have the produce of each vine of one vineyard, in the &s;ame year, kept &s;eparate, would &s;erve no purpo&s;e. To know that our wine (to u&s;e an adverti&s;ing phra&s;e,) is <Q REND="inline">"of the &s;tock of an Amba&s;&s;adour lately decea&s;ed,"</Q> heightens its flavour: but it &s;ignifies nothing to know the bin where each bottle was once depo&s;ited.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Garrick (he ob&s;erved,) does not play the part of Archer in <Q REND="inline">"The Beaux Stratagem"</Q> well. The gentleman &s;hould break out through the footman, which is not the ca&s;e as he does it."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="72" MS="y">
<Q>"Where there is no education, as in &s;avage countries, men will have the  upper hand of women. Bodily &s;trength, no doubt, contributes to this: but it would be &s;o, exclu&s;ive of that; for it is mind that always governs. When it comes to dry under&s;tanding, man has the better."</Q></P>
<P><Q>"The little volumes entitled <Q REND="inline">"Re&s;publicae,"</Q> which are very well done, were a book&s;eller's work."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is much talk of the mi&s;ery which we cau&s;e to the brute creation; but they are recompen&s;ed by exi&s;tence. If they were not u&s;eful to man, and therefore protected by him, they would not be nearly &s;o numerous."</Q> This argument is to be found in the able and benignant Hutchin&s;on's <Q REND="inline">"Moral Philo&s;ophy."</Q> But the que&s;tion is, whether the animals who endure &s;uch &s;ufferings of various kinds, for the &s;ervice and entertainment of man, would accept of exi&s;tence upon the terms on which they have it. Madame Sevign&eacute;, who, though &s;he had many enjoyments, felt with delicate &s;en&s;ibility the preva|lence of mi&s;ery, complains of the ta&s;k of exi&s;tence having been impo&s;ed upon her without her con&s;ent.</P>
<P><Q>"That man is never happy for the pre&s;ent is &s;o true, that all his relief from unhappine&s;s is only forgetting him&s;elf for a little while. Life is a pro|gre&s;s from want to want, not from enjoyment to enjoyment."</Q></P>
<P><Q>"Though many men are nominally entru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of ho&s;pitals and other publick in&s;titutions, almo&s;t all the good is done by one man, by whom the re&s;t are driven on; owing to confidence in him, and indolence in them."</Q></P>
<P><Q>"Lord Che&s;terfield's Letters to his &s;on, I think, might be made a very pretty book. Take out the immorality, and it &s;hould be put into the hands of every young gentleman. An elegant manner and ea&s;ine&s;s of behaviour are acquired gradually and imperceptibly. No man can &s;ay, 'I'll be genteel.' There are ten genteel women for one genteel man, becau&s;e they are more re&s;trained. A man without &s;ome degree of re&s;traint is in&s;ufferable; but we are all le&s;s re&s;trained than women. Were a woman &s;itting in company to put out her legs before her as mo&s;t men do, we &s;hould be tempted to kick them in."</Q></P>
<P>No man was a more attentive and nice ob&s;erver of behaviour in tho&s;e in who&s;e company he happened to be, than John&s;on; or, however &s;trange it may &s;eem to many, had a higher e&s;timation of its refinements. Lord Eliot informs me, that one day when John&s;on and he were at dinner at a gentleman's hou&s;e in London, upon Lord Che&s;terfield's Letters being mentioned, John&s;on &s;ur|prized the company by this &s;entence: <Q REND="inline">"Every man of any education would
<PB N="72" REF="73" MS="y">
 rather be called a ra&s;cal, than accu&s;ed of deficiency in <HI>the graces.</HI>"</Q> Mr. Gibbon, who was pre&s;ent, turned to a lady who knew John&s;on well and lived much with him, and in his quaint manner, tapping his box, addre&s;&s;ed her thus: <Q REND="inline">"Don't you think, Madam, (looking towards John&s;on,) that among <HI>all</HI> your acquaintance you could find <HI>one</HI> exception?"</Q> The lady &s;miled, and &s;eemed to acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I read (&s;aid he) Sharpe's letters on Italy over again when I was at Bath. There is a great deal of matter in them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Williams was angry that Thrale's family did not &s;end regularly to her every time they heard from me while I was in the Hebrides. Little people are apt to be jealous: but they &s;hould not be jealous; for they ought to con&s;ider, that &s;uperiour attention will nece&s;&s;arily be paid to &s;uperiour fortune or rank. Two per&s;ons may have equal merit, and on that account may have an equal claim to attention; but one of them may have al&s;o fortune and rank, and &s;o may have a double claim."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of his notes on Shak&s;peare, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e who do not &s;ee that I am right in the pa&s;&s;age where <HI>as</HI> is repeated, and 'a&s;&s;es of great charge' introduced. That on 'To be, or not to be,' is di&s;putable <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">It may be ob&s;erved, that Mr. Malone, in his very valuable edition of Shak&s;peare, has fully vindicated Dr. John&s;on from the idle cen&s;ures which the fir&s;t of the&s;e notes has given ri&s;e to. The interpretation of the other pa&s;&s;age, which Dr. John&s;on allows to be <HI>di&s;putable,</HI> he has clearly &s;hewn to be erroneous.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>A gentleman, whom I found &s;itting with him one morning, &s;aid, that in his opinion the character of an infidel was more dete&s;table than that of a man notoriou&s;ly guilty of an atrocious crime. I differed from him, becau&s;e we are &s;urer of the odiou&s;ne&s;s of the one, than of the errour of the other. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I agree with him; for the infidel would be guilty of any crime if he were inclined to it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Many things which are fal&s;e are tran&s;mitted from book to book, and gain credit in the world. One of the&s;e is the cry again&s;t the evil of luxury. Now the truth is, that luxury produces much good. Take the luxury of building in London. Does it not produce real advantage in the conveniency and elegance of accommodation, and this all from the exertion of indu&s;try? People will tell you, with a melancholy face, how many builders are in gaol. It is plain they are in gaol, not for building; for rents are not fallen.&mdash;A man gives half a guinea for a di&s;h of green peas. How much gardening does this occa&s;ion? how many labourers mu&s;t the competition to have &s;uch things
<PB N="73" REF="74" MS="y">
early in the market, keep in employment? You will hear it &s;aid, very gravely,  'Why was not the half-guinea, thus &s;pent in luxury, given to the poor? To how many might it have afforded a good meal?' Alas! has it not gone to the <HI>indu&s;trious</HI> poor, whom it is better to &s;upport than the <HI>idle</HI> poor? You are much &s;urer that you are doing good when you <HI>pay</HI> money to tho&s;e who work, as the recompence of their labour, than when you <HI>give</HI> money merely in charity. Suppo&s;e the ancient luxury of a di&s;h of peacock's brains were to be revived; how many carca&s;es would be left to the poor at a cheap rate? And as to the rout that is made about people who are ruined by extravagance, it is no matter to the nation that &s;ome individuals &s;uffer. When &s;o much general productive exertion is the con&s;equence of luxury, the nation does not care though there are debtors in gaol; nay, they would not care though their creditors were there too."</Q></P>
<P>The uncommon vivacity of General Oglethorpe's mind, and variety of know|ledge, having &s;ometimes made his conver&s;ation &s;eem too de&s;ultory, John&s;on ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"Oglethorpe, Sir, never <HI>completes</HI> what he has to &s;ay."</Q></P>
<P>When I complained of having dined at a &s;plendid table without hearing one &s;entence of conver&s;ation worthy of being remembered, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, there &s;eldom is any &s;uch conver&s;ation."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Why then meet at table?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why to eat and drink together, and promote kind|ne&s;s; and, Sir, this is better done when there is no &s;olid conver&s;ation; for when there is, people differ in opinion, and get into bad humour, or &s;ome of the company who are not capable of &s;uch conver&s;ation, are left out, and feel them&s;elves unea&s;y. It was for this rea&s;on, Sir Robert Walpole &s;aid, he always talked bawdy at his table, becau&s;e in that all could join."</Q></P>
<P>Being irritated by hearing a gentleman a&s;k Mr. Levett a variety of que&s;tions concerning him, when he was &s;itting by, he broke out, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you have but two topicks, your&s;elf and me.

There was a Dr. Oldfield, who was always talking of the Duke of Marlborough. He came into a coffee-hou&s;e one day, and told that his Grace had &s;poken in the Hou&s;e of Lords for half an hour. 'Did he indeed &s;peak for half an hour?'

<P>During my &s;tay in London this &s;pring, I &s;olicited his attention to another law ca&s;e, in which I was engaged. In the cour&s;e of a conte&s;ted election for the borough of Dunfermline, which I attended, as one of my friend Colonel (now Sir Archibald) Campbell's coun&s;el, a man, one of his political agents, who was charged with having been unfaithful to his employer, and having de&s;erted to the oppo&s;ite party for a pecuniary reward&mdash;attacked very rudely in a new&s;paper the Reverend Mr. James Thom&s;on, one of the mini&s;ters of that place, on account of a &s;uppo&s;ed allu&s;ion to him in one of his &s;ermons. Upon this the mini&s;ter, on a &s;ub&s;equent Sunday, arraigned him by name from the pulpit with &s;ome &s;everity; and the agent, after the &s;ermon was over, ro&s;e up and a&s;ked the mini&s;ter aloud, <Q REND="inline">"What bribe he had received for telling &s;o many lies from the chair of veracity."</Q> I was pre&s;ent at this very extraordinary &s;cene. The per&s;on arraigned, and his father and brother, who had al&s;o had a &s;hare both of the reproof from the pulpit, and in the retalia|tion, brought an action again&s;t Mr. Thom&s;on, in the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, for defamation and damages, and I was one of the coun&s;el for the reverend defendant. <HI>The Liberty of the Pulpit</HI> was our great ground of defence; but we argued al&s;o on the provocation of the previous attack, and on the in&s;tant retaliation. The Court of Se&s;&s;ion, however, the fifteen Judges, who are at the &s;ame time the jury, decided again&s;t the mini&s;ter, contrary to my humble opinion; and &s;everal of them expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves with indignation again&s;t him. He was an aged gentleman, formerly a military chaplain, and a man of high &s;pirit and honour. John&s;on was &s;atisfied that the judgement
<PB N="75" REF="76">
was wrong, and dictated to me the following argument in confutation  of it:</P>
<Q><P>OF the cen&s;ure pronounced from the pulpit, our determination mu&s;t be formed, as in other ca&s;es, by a con&s;ideration of the action it&s;elf, and the particular circum&s;tances with which it is inve&s;ted.</P>
<P>The right of cen&s;ure and rebuke &s;eems nece&s;&s;arily appendant to the pa&s;toral office. He, to whom the care of a congregation is entru&s;ted, is con&s;idered as the &s;hepherd of a flock, as the teacher of a &s;chool, as the father of a family. As a &s;hepherd tending not his own &s;heep but tho&s;e of his ma&s;ter, he is an&s;werable for tho&s;e that &s;tray, and that lo&s;e them&s;elves by &s;traying. But no man can be an&s;werable for lo&s;&s;es which he has not power to prevent, or for vagrancy which he has not authority to re&s;train.</P>
<P>As a teacher giving in&s;truction for wages, and liable to reproach if tho&s;e whom he undertakes to inform make no proficiency, he mu&s;t have the power of enforcing attendance, of awakening negligence, and repre&s;&s;ing con|tradiction.</P>
<P>As a father, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the paternal authority of admonition, rebuke, and puni&s;hment. He cannot without reducing his office to an empty name, be hindered from the exerci&s;e of any practice nece&s;&s;ary to &s;timulate the idle, to reform the vicious, to check the petulant, and correct the &s;tubborn.</P>
<P>If we enquire into the practice of the primitive church, we &s;hall, I believe, find the mini&s;ters of the Word exerci&s;ing the whole authority of this complicated character. We &s;hall find them not only encouraging the good by exhortation, but terrifying the wicked by reproof and denunciation. In the earlie&s;t ages of the Church, while religion was yet pure from &s;ecular advantages, the puni&s;hment of &s;inners was publick cen&s;ure, and open penance; penalties inflicted merely by eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority, at a time while the church had yet no help from the civil power, while the hand of the magi&s;trate lifted only the rod of per&s;ecution; and when governours were ready to afford a refuge to all tho&s;e who fled from clerical authority.</P>
<P>That the Church, therefore, had once a power of publick cen&s;ure is evident, becau&s;e that power was frequently exerci&s;ed. That it borrowed not its power from the civil authority, is likewi&s;e certain, becau&s;e civil authority was at that time its enemy.</P>
<P>The hour came at length, when after three hundred years of &s;truggle and di&s;tre&s;s, Truth took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of imperial power, and the civil laws lent their aid to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titutions. The magi&s;trate from that time co-operated
<PB N="76" REF="77">
 with the prie&s;t, and clerical &s;entences were made efficacious by &s;ecular force. But the State, when it came to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Church, had no intention to dimini&s;h its authority. Tho&s;e rebukes and tho&s;e cen&s;ures which were lawful before, were lawful &s;till. But they had hitherto operated only upon voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The refractory and contemptuous were at fir&s;t in no danger of temporal &s;everities, except what they might &s;uffer from the reproaches of con&s;cience, or the dete&s;tation of their fellow Chri&s;tians. When religion obtained the &s;upport of law, if admonitions and cen&s;ures had no effect, they were &s;econded by the magi&s;trates with coercion and puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>It therefore appears from eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, that the right of inflicting &s;hame by publick cen&s;ure, has been always con&s;idered as inherent in the Church; and that this right was not conferred by the civil power; for, it was exerci&s;ed when the civil power operated again&s;t it. By the civil power it was never taken away; for the Chri&s;tian magi&s;trate interpo&s;ed his office not to re&s;cue &s;inners from cen&s;ure, but to &s;upply more powerful means of re|formation; to add pain where &s;hame was in&s;ufficient; and when men were proclaimed unworthy of the &s;ociety of the faithful, to re&s;train them by impri&s;onment, from &s;preading abroad the contagion of wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is not improbable that from this acknowledged power of publick cen&s;ure, grew in time the practice of auricular confe&s;&s;ion. Tho&s;e who dreaded the bla&s;t of publick reprehen&s;ion, were willing to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the prie&s;t, by a private accu&s;ation of them&s;elves; and to obtain a recon|ciliation with the Church by a kind of clande&s;tine ab&s;olution and invi&s;ible penance; conditions with which the prie&s;t would in times of ignorance and corruption ea&s;ily comply, as they increa&s;ed his influence, by adding the knowledge of &s;ecret &s;ins to that of notorious offences, and enlarged his authority, by making him the &s;ole arbiter of the terms of reconcilement.</P>
<P>From this bondage the Reformation &s;et us free. The mini&s;ter has no longer power to pre&s;s into the retirements of con&s;cience, to torture us by interrogatories, or put him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our &s;ecrets and our lives. But though we have thus controuled his u&s;urpations, his ju&s;t and original power remains unimpaired. He may &s;till &s;ee, though he may not pry: he may yet hear, though he may not que&s;tion. And that knowledge which his eyes and ears force upon him it is &s;till his duty to u&s;e, for the benefit of his flock. A father who lives near a wicked neighbour, may forbid a &s;on to frequent his company. A mini&s;ter who has in his congregation a man of open and &s;candalous wickedne&s;s, may warn his pari&s;hioners to &s;hun his conver&s;ation. To warn them is not only lawful, but not to warn them would be criminal.
<PB N="77" REF="78">
He may warn them one by one in friendly conver&s;e, or by a parochial  vi&s;itation. But if he may warn each man &s;ingly, what &s;hall forbid him to warn them all together? Of that which is to be made known to all, how is there any difference whether it be communicated to each &s;ingly, or to all together? What is known to all, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be publick. Whether it &s;hall be publick at once, or publick by degrees, is the only que&s;tion. And of a &s;udden and &s;olemn publication the impre&s;&s;ion is deeper, and the warning more effectual.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be urged, if a mini&s;ter be thus left at liberty to delate &s;inners from the pulpit, and to publi&s;h at will the crimes of a pari&s;hioner, he may often bla&s;t the innocent, and di&s;tre&s;s the timorous. He may be &s;u&s;picious, and condemn without evidence; he may be ra&s;h, and judge without examination; he may be &s;evere, and treat &s;light offences with too much har&s;hne&s;s; he may be malignant and partial, and gratify his private intere&s;t or re&s;entment, under the &s;helter of his pa&s;toral character.</P>
<P>Of all this there is po&s;&s;ibility, and of all this there is danger. But if po&s;&s;ibility of evil be to exclude good, no good ever can be done. If nothing is to be attempted in which there is danger, we mu&s;t all &s;ink into hopele&s;s inactivity. The evils that may be feared from this practice ari&s;e not from any defect in the in&s;titution, but from the infirmities of human nature. Power, in whatever hands it is placed, will be &s;ometimes improperly exerted; yet courts of law mu&s;t judge, though they will &s;ometimes judge ami&s;s. A father mu&s;t in&s;truct his children, though he him&s;elf may often want in|&s;truction. A mini&s;ter mu&s;t cen&s;ure &s;inners, though his cen&s;ure may be &s;ome|times erroneous by want of judgement, and &s;ometimes unju&s;t by want of hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>If we examine the circum&s;tances of the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, we &s;hall find the &s;entence neither erroneous nor unju&s;t; we &s;hall find no breach of private confidence, no intru&s;ion into &s;ecret tran&s;actions. The fact was notorious and indubitable; &s;o ea&s;y to be proved, that no proof was de&s;ired. The act was ba&s;e and treacherous, the perpetration in&s;olent and open, and the example naturally mi&s;chievous. The mini&s;ter, however, being retired and reclu&s;e, had not yet heard what was publickly known throughout the pari&s;h; and on occa&s;ion of a publick election, warned his people, according to his duty, again&s;t the crimes which publick elections frequently produce. His warning was felt by one of his pari&s;honers, as pointed particularly at him&s;elf. But in&s;tead of producing as might be wi&s;hed, private compunction and immediate reformation, it kindled only rage and re&s;entment. He charged his mini&s;ter,
<PB N="78" REF="79">
 in a publick paper, with &s;candal, defamation, and fal&s;ehood. The mini&s;ter, thus reproached, had his own character to vindicate, upon which his pa&s;toral authority mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily depend. To be charged with a defamatory lie is an injury which no man patiently endures in common life. To be charged with polluting the pa&s;toral office with &s;candal and fal&s;ehood was a violation of character &s;till more atrocious, as it affected not only his per&s;onal but his clerical veracity. His indignation naturally ro&s;e in proportion to his hone&s;ty, and with all the fortitude of injured hone&s;ty, he dared this calumniator in the church, and at once exonerated him&s;elf from cen&s;ure, and re&s;cued his flock from deception and from danger. The man whom he accu&s;es pretends not to be innocent; or at lea&s;t only pretends, for he declines a trial. The crime of which he is accu&s;ed has frequent opportunities and &s;trong temptations. It has already &s;pread far, with much depravation of private morals, and much injury to publick happine&s;s. To warn the people, therefore, again&s;t it was not wanton and officious, but nece&s;&s;ary and pa&s;toral.</P>
<P>What then is the fault with which this worthy mini&s;ter is charged? He has u&s;urped no dominion over con&s;cience. He has exerted no authority in &s;upport of doubtful and controverted opinions. He has not dragged into light a ba&s;hful and corrigible &s;inner. His cen&s;ure was directed again&s;t a breach of morality, again&s;t an act which no man ju&s;tifies. The man who appropriated this cen&s;ure to him&s;elf, is evidently and notoriou&s;ly guilty. His con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own wickedne&s;s incited him to attack his faithful reprover with open in&s;olence and painted accu&s;ations. Such an attack made defence nece&s;&s;ary, and we hope it will be at la&s;t decided that the means of defence were ju&s;t and lawful.</P></Q>
<P>When I read this to Mr. Burke, he was highly plea&s;ed, and exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Well, he does his work in a workman-like manner <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">As a proof of Dr. John&s;on's extraordinary powers of compo&s;ition, it appears from the original manu&s;cript of this excellent di&s;&s;ertation, of which he dictated the fir&s;t eight paragraphs on the 10th of May, and the remainder on the 13th, that there are in the whole only &s;even corrections, or rather variations, and tho&s;e not con&s;iderable. Such were at once the vigorous and accurate emanations of his mind.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Thom&s;on wi&s;hed to bring the cau&s;e by appeal before the Hou&s;e of Lords, but was di&s;&s;uaded by the advice of the noble per&s;on who now pre&s;ides &s;o ably in that Mo&s;t Honourable Hou&s;e, and who was then Attorney-General.

<ITEM>1. Petition for the Reverend Mr. James Thom&s;on, mini&s;ter of Dunfermline.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. An&s;wers thereto.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Copy of the judgement of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion upon both.</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e papers you will plea&s;e to peru&s;e, and give your opinion, <Q REND="inline">"Whether there is a probability of the above decree of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion's being rever&s;ed, if Mr. Thom&s;on &s;hould appeal from the &s;ame?"</Q></P>
<P>I DON'T think the appeal advi&s;eable: not only becau&s;e the value of the judgement is in no degree adequate to the expence, but becau&s;e there are many chances, that, upon the general complexion of the ca&s;e, the impre&s;&s;ion will be taken to the di&s;advantage of the appellant.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to approve the &s;tyle of that &s;ermon. But the <HI>complaint</HI> was not le&s;s ungracious from that man, who had behaved &s;o ill by his original libel, and, at the time, when he received the reproach he complains of. In the la&s;t article all the plaintiffs are equally concerned. It &s;truck me al&s;o with &s;ome wonder, that the Judges &s;hould think &s;o much fervour appo&s;ite to the occa&s;ion of reproving the defendant for a little exce&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon the matter, however, I agree with them in condemning the behaviour of the mini&s;ter; and in thinking it a &s;ubject fit for eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure; and even for an action, if any individual could qualify<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">It is curious to ob&s;erve that Lord Thurlow has here, perhaps in compliment to North-Britain, made u&s;e of a term of the Scotch law, which to an Engli&s;h reader may require explanation. To <HI>qualify</HI> a wrong, is to point out and e&s;tabli&s;h it.</NOTE> a wrong, and a damage ari&s;ing from it. But this I doubt. The circum&s;tance of publi&s;hing the reproach in a pulpit, though extremely indecent, and culpable in another view, does not con&s;titute a different &s;ort of wrong, or any other rule of law, than would have obtained, if the &s;ame words had been pronounced el&s;ewhere. I don't know, whether there be any difference in the law of Scotland, in the definition of &s;lander, before the Commi&s;&s;aries, or the Court of Se&s;&s;ion. The common law of England does not give way to actions for every reproachful word. An action cannot be brought for general damages, upon any words
<PB N="80" REF="81" MS="y">
 which import le&s;s than an offence cogni&s;able by law; con&s;equently no action could have been brought here for the words in que&s;tion. Both laws admit the truth to be a ju&s;tification in actions <HI>for words;</HI> and the law of England does the &s;ame in actions for libels. The judgement, therefore, &s;eems to me to have been wrong, in that the Court repelled that defence.</P>

<P>I am now to record a very curious incident in Dr. John&s;on's Life, which fell under my own ob&s;ervation; of which <HI>pars magna fui,</HI> and which I am per|&s;uaded will, with the liberal-minded, be much to his credit.</P>
<P>My de&s;ire of being acquainted with celebrated men of every de&s;cription, had made me, much about the &s;ame time, obtain an introduction to Dr. Samuel John&s;on and to John Wilkes, E&s;q. Two men more different could perhaps not be &s;elected out from all mankind. They had even attacked one another with &s;ome a&s;perity in their writings; yet I lived in habits of friend&s;hip with both. I could fully reli&s;h the excellence of each; for I have ever delighted in that intellectual chymi&s;try which can &s;eparate good qualities from evil in the &s;ame per&s;on.</P>
<P>Sir John Pringle, <Q REND="inline">"mine own friend and my Father's friend,"</Q> between whom and Dr. John&s;on I in vain wi&s;hed to e&s;tabli&s;h an acquaintance, as I re&s;pected and lived in intimacy with both of them, ob&s;erved to me once, very ingeniou&s;ly, <Q REND="inline">"It is not in friend&s;hip as in mathematicks, where two things, each equal to a third, are equal between them&s;elves. You agree with John&s;on as a middle quality, and you agree with me as a middle quality; but John&s;on and I &s;hould not agree."</Q> Sir John was not &s;ufficiently flexible; &s;o I de&s;i&s;ted; knowing, indeed, that the repul&s;ion was equally &s;trong on the part of John&s;on; who, I know not from what cau&s;e, unle&s;s his being a Scotchman, had formed a very erroneous opinion of Sir John. But I conceived an irre&s;i&s;tible wi&s;h, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring Dr. John&s;on and Mr. Wilkes together. How to manage it, was a nice and difficult matter.</P>
<P>My worthy book&s;ellers and friends, Me&s;&s;ieurs Dillys in the Poultry, at who&s;e ho&s;pitable and well-covered table I have &s;een a greater number of literary men than at any other, except that of Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, had invited me to meet Mr. Wilkes and &s;ome more gentlemen on Wedne&s;day, May 15. <Q REND="inline">"Pray (&s;aid I,) let us have Dr. John&s;on."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What, with Mr. Wilkes? not for the world, (&s;aid Mr. Edward Dilly): Dr. John&s;on would never forgive me."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Come, (&s;aid I,) if you'll let me negociate for you, I will be an&s;werable
<PB N="81" REF="82" MS="y">
that all &s;hall go well."</Q> DILLY. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, if you will take it upon you, I am  &s;ure I &s;hall be very happy to &s;ee them both here."</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the high veneration which I entertained for Dr. John&s;on, I was &s;en&s;ible that he was &s;ometimes a little actuated by the &s;pirit of contradic|tion, and by means of that I hoped I &s;hould gain my point. I was per&s;uaded that if I had come upon him with a direct propo&s;al, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, will you dine in company with Jack Wilkes?"</Q> he would have flown into a pa&s;&s;ion, and would probably have an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Dine with Jack Wilkes, Sir! I'd as &s;oon dine with Jack Ketch<NOTE PLACE="foot">This has been circulated as if actually &s;aid by John&s;on, when the truth is it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> by me. </NOTE>."</Q> I therefore, while we were &s;itting quietly by our&s;elves at his hou&s;e in an evening, took occa&s;ion to open my plan thus:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mr. Dilly, Sir, &s;ends his re&s;pectful compliments to you, and would be happy if you would do him the honour to dine with him on Wedne&s;day next along with me, as I mu&s;t &s;oon go to Scotland."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I am obliged to Mr. Dilly. I will wait upon him&mdash;"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Provided, Sir, I &s;uppo&s;e, that the company which he is to have is agreeable to you."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"What do you mean, Sir? What do you take me for? Do you think I am &s;o ignorant of the world, as to imagine that I am to pre&s;cribe to a gentleman what company he is to have at his table?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I beg your pardon, Sir, for wi&s;hing to prevent you from meeting people whom you might not like. Perhaps he may have &s;ome of what he calls his patriotick friends with him."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, and what then? What care <HI>I</HI> for his <HI>patriotick friends?</HI> Poh!"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould not be &s;urprized to find Jack Wilkes there."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"And if Jack Wilkes <HI>&s;hould</HI> be there, what is that to <HI>me,</HI> Sir? My dear friend, let us have no more of this. I am &s;orry to be angry with you; but really it is treating me &s;trangely to talk to me as if I could not meet any company whatever, occa&s;ionally."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Pray forgive me, Sir: I meant well. But you &s;hall meet whoever comes, for me."</Q> Thus I &s;ecured him, and told Dilly that he would find him very well plea&s;ed to be one of his gue&s;ts on the day appointed.</P>
<P>Upon the much-expected Wedne&s;day, I called on him about half an hour before dinner, as I often did when we were to dine out together, to &s;ee that he was ready in time, and to accompany him. I found him buffeting his books, as upon a former occa&s;ion ^1<NOTE PLACE="foot">See page 47 of this volume.</NOTE>, covered with du&s;t, and making no preparation for going abroad. <Q REND="inline">"How is this, Sir? (&s;aid I). Don't you recollect that you are to dine at Mr. Dilly's?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I did not
<PB N="82" REF="83">
 think of going to Dilly's: it went out of my head. I have ordered dinner at home with Mrs. Williams."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, my dear Sir, you know you were engaged to Mr. Dilly, and I told him &s;o. He will expect you, and will be much di&s;appointed if you don't come."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t talk to Mrs. Williams about this."</Q></P>
<P>Here was a &s;ad dilemma. I feared that what I was &s;o confident I had &s;ecured would yet be fru&s;trated. He had accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to &s;hew Mrs. Williams &s;uch a degree of humane attention, as frequently impo&s;ed &s;ome re&s;traint upon him; and I knew that if &s;he &s;hould be ob&s;tinate, he would not &s;tir. I ha&s;tened down &s;tairs to the blind lady's room, and told her I was in great unea&s;ine&s;s, for Dr. John&s;on had engaged to me to dine this day at Mr. Dilly's, but that he had told me he had forgotten his engagement, and had ordered dinner at home. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, (&s;aid &s;he, pretty peevi&s;hly,) Dr. John&s;on is to dine at home."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Madam, (&s;aid I,) his re&s;pect for you is &s;uch, that I know he will not leave you unle&s;s you ab&s;olutely de&s;ire it. But as you have &s;o much of his company, I hope you will be good enough to forego it for a day, as Mr. Dilly is a very worthy man, has frequently had agreeable parties at his hou&s;e for Dr. John&s;on, and will be vexed if the Doctor neglects him to-day. And then, Madam, be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider my &s;ituation;&mdash;I carried the me&s;&s;age, and I a&s;&s;ured Mr. Dilly that Dr. John&s;on was to come, and no doubt he has made a dinner, and invited a company, and boa&s;ted of the honour he expected to have. I &s;hall be quite di&s;graced if the Doctor is not there."</Q> She gradually &s;oftened to my &s;olicitations, which were certainly as earne&s;t as mo&s;t entreaties to ladies upon any occa&s;ion, and was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to empower me to tell Dr. John&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"That all things con&s;idered, &s;he thought he &s;hould certainly go."</Q> I flew back to him, &s;till in du&s;t, and carele&s;s of what &s;hould be the event, <Q REND="inline">"indifferent in his choice to go or &s;tay;"</Q> but as &s;oon as I had announced to him Mrs. Williams's con&s;ent, he roared, <Q REND="inline">"Frank, a clean &s;hirt,"</Q> and was very &s;oon dre&s;t. When I had him fairly &s;eated in a hackney-coach with me, I exulted as much as a &s;ortune-hunter who has got an heire&s;s into a po&s;t-chai&s;e with him to &s;et out for Gretna-Green.</P>
<P>When we entered Mr. Dilly's drawing-room, he found him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of a company he did not know. I kept my&s;elf &s;nug and &s;ilent, watching how he would conduct him&s;elf. I ob&s;erved him whi&s;pering to Mr. Dilly, <Q REND="inline">"Who is that gentleman, Sir?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mr. Arthur Lee."</Q>&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Tut, tut, tut,"</Q> (under his breath,) which was one of his habitual mutterings. Mr. Arthur Lee could not but be very obnoxious to John&s;on, for he was not only a <HI>patriot</HI> but an <HI>American.</HI> He was afterwards mini&s;ter from the United States at the court

of Madrid. <Q REND="inline">"And who is the gentleman in lace?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mr. Wilkes, Sir."</Q>  This information confounded him &s;till more; he had &s;ome difficulty to re&s;train him&s;elf, and taking up a book, &s;at down upon a window-&s;eat and read, or at lea&s;t kept his eye upon it intently for &s;ome time, till he com|po&s;ed him&s;elf. His feelings, I dare &s;ay, were aukward enough. But he no doubt recollected his having rated me for &s;uppo&s;ing that he could be at all di&s;concerted by any company, and he, therefore, re&s;olutely &s;et him&s;elf to behave quite as an ea&s;y man of the world, who could adapt him&s;elf at once to the di&s;po&s;ition and manners of tho&s;e whom he might chance to meet.</P>
<P>The cheering &s;ound of <Q REND="inline">"Dinner is upon the table,"</Q> di&s;&s;olved his reverie, and we <HI>all</HI> &s;at down without any &s;ymptom of ill humour. There were pre&s;ent, be&s;ides Mr. Wilkes, and Mr. Arthur Lee, who was an old companion of mine when he &s;tudied phy&s;ick at Edinburgh, Mr. (now Sir John) Miller, Dr. Lett&s;om, and Mr. Slater the druggi&s;t. Mr. Wilkes placed him&s;elf next to Dr. John&s;on, and behaved to him with &s;o much attention and politene&s;s, that he gained upon him in&s;en&s;ibly. No man eat more heartily than John&s;on, or loved better what was nice and delicate. Mr. Wilkes was very a&s;&s;iduous in helping him to &s;ome fine veal. <Q REND="inline">"Pray give me leave, Sir:&mdash;It is better here&mdash;A little of the brown&mdash;Some fat, Sir&mdash;A little of the &s;tuffing&mdash;Some gravy&mdash;Let me have the plea&s;ure of giving you &s;ome butter&mdash;Allow me to recommend a &s;queeze of this orange&mdash;or the lemon, perhaps, may have more ze&s;t."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sir, Sir, I am obliged to you, Sir,"</Q> cried John&s;on, bowing, and turning his head to him with a look for &s;ome time of <Q REND="inline">"&s;urly virtue <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">John&s;on's <Q REND="inline">"London, a Poem,"</Q> v. 145.</NOTE>,"</Q> but, in a &s;hort while, of complacency.</P>
<P>Foote being mentioned, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He is not a good mimick."</Q> One of the company added, <Q REND="inline">"A merry Andrew, a buffoon."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But he has wit too, and is not deficient in ideas, or in fertility and variety of imagery, and not empty of reading; he has knowledge enough to fill up his part. One &s;pecies of wit he has in an eminent degree, that of e&s;cape. You drive him into a corner with both hands; but he's gone, Sir, when you think you have got him&mdash;like an animal that jumps over your head. Then he has a great range for his wit; he never lets truth &s;tand between him and a je&s;t, and he is &s;ometimes mighty coar&s;e. Garrick is under many re&s;traints from which Foote is free."</Q> WILKES. <Q REND="inline">"Garrick's wit is more like Lord Che&s;terfield's."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"The fir&s;t time I was in company with Foote was at Fitzherbert's. Having no good opinion of the fellow, I was re&s;olved not to be plea&s;ed, and it is very difficult to plea&s;e a man again&s;t his will. I went
<PB N="84" REF="85" MS="y">
 on eating my dinner pretty &s;ullenly, affecting not to mind him. But the dog was &s;o very comical, that I was obliged to lay down my knife and fork, throw my&s;elf back upon my chair, and fairly laugh it out. No, Sir, he was irre&s;i&s;tible <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Foote told me that John&s;on &s;aid of him, <Q REND="inline">"For loud ob&s;treperous broad-&s;aced mirth, I know not his equal."</Q></NOTE>.</Q> He upon one occa&s;ion experienced, in an extraordinary degree, the efficacy of his powers of entertaining. Among&s;t the many and various modes which he tried of getting money, he became a partner with a &s;mall-beer brewer, and he was to have a &s;hare of the profits for procuring cu&s;tomers among&s;t his numerous acquaintance. Fitzherbert was one who took his &s;mall-beer; but it was &s;o bad that the &s;ervants re&s;olved not to drink it. They were at &s;ome lo&s;s how to notify their re&s;olution, being afraid of offending their ma&s;ter, who they knew liked Foote much as a companion. At la&s;t they fixed upon a little black boy, who was rather a favourite, to be their deputy, and deliver their remon&s;trance; and having inve&s;ted him with the whole authority of the kitchen, he was to inform Mr. Fitzherbert, in all their names, upon a certain day, that they would drink Foote's &s;mall-beer no longer. On that day Foote happened to dine at Fitzherbert's, and this boy &s;erved at table; he was &s;o delighted with Foote's &s;tories, and merriment, and grimace, that when he went down &s;tairs, he told them, <Q REND="inline">"This is the fine&s;t man I have ever &s;een. I will not deliver your me&s;&s;age. I will drink his &s;mall-beer."</Q></P>
<P>Somebody ob&s;erved that Garrick could not have done this. WILKES. <Q REND="inline">"Garrick would have made the &s;mall-beer &s;till &s;maller. He is now leaving the &s;tage, but he will play <HI>Scrub</HI> all his life."</Q> I knew that John&s;on would let nobody attack Garrick but him&s;elf, as Garrick once &s;aid to me, and I had heard him prai&s;e his liberality; &s;o to bring out his commendation of his celebrated pupil, I &s;aid, loudly, <Q REND="inline">"I have heard Garrick is liberal."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, I know that Garrick has given away more money than any man in England that I am acquainted with, and that not from o&s;tentatious views. Garrick was very poor when he began life; &s;o when he came to have money, he probably was very un&s;kilful in giving away, and &s;aved when he &s;hould not. But Garrick began to be liberal as &s;oon as he could; and I am of opinion, the reputation of avarice which he has had, has been very lucky for him, and prevented his having many enemies. You de&s;pi&s;e a man for avarice, but do not hate him. Garrick might have been much better attacked for living with more &s;plendour than is &s;uitable to a player: if they had had the wit to have a&s;&s;aulted him in that quarter, they might have galled him more. But
<PB N="85" REF="86" MS="y">
they have kept clamouring about his avarice, which has re&s;cued him from  much obloquy and envy."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of the great difficulty of obtaining authentick information for biography, John&s;on told us, <Q REND="inline">"When I was a young fellow I wanted to write the 'Life of Dryden,' and in order to get materials, I applied to the only two per&s;ons then alive who had &s;een him; the&s;e were old Swiney, and old Cibber. Swiney's information was no more than this, 'That at Will's coffee|hou&s;e Dryden had a particular chair for him&s;elf, which was &s;et by the fire in winter, and was then called his winter-chair; and that it was carried out for him to the balcony in &s;ummer, and was then called his &s;ummer-chair.' Cibber could tell no more but 'That he remembered him a decent old man, arbiter of critical di&s;putes at Will's.' You are to con&s;ider that Cibber was then at a great di&s;tance from Dryden, had perhaps one leg only in the room, and dur&s;t not draw in the other."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Yet Cibber was a man of ob&s;erva|tion?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I think not."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"You will allow his 'Apology' to be well done."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Very well done, to be &s;ure, Sir. That book is a &s;triking proof of the ju&s;tice of Pope's remark:
<Q><L>'Each might his &s;everal province well command,</L>
<L>'Would all but &s;toop to what they under&s;tand."</L></Q></Q>
BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"And his plays are good."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes; but that was his trade; <HI>l'e&s;prit du corps;</HI> he had been all his life among players and play|writers. I wondered that he had &s;o little to &s;ay in conver&s;ation, for he had kept the be&s;t company, and learnt all that can be got by the ear. He abu&s;ed Pindar to me, and then &s;hewed me an Ode of his own, with an ab&s;urd coupler, making a linnet &s;oar on an eagle's wing <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">See page 217 of Vol. I.</NOTE>. I told him that when the ancients made a &s;imile, they always made it like &s;omething real."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Wilkes remarked, that <Q REND="inline">"among all the bold &s;lights of Shak&s;peare's imagination, the bolde&s;t was making Birnam-wood march to Dun&s;inane; creating a wood where there never was a &s;hrub; a wood in Scotland! ha! ha! ha!"</Q> And he al&s;o ob&s;erved, that <Q REND="inline">"the clanni&s;h &s;lavery of the Highlands of Scotland was the &s;ingle exception to Milton's remark of 'The Mountain Nymph, &s;weet Liberty,' being wor&s;hipped in all hilly countries."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"When I was at Inverary (&s;aid he,) on a vi&s;it to my old friend, Archibald, Duke of Argyle, his dependents congratulated me on being &s;uch a favourite of his Grace. I &s;aid, 'It is then, gentlemen, truly lucky for me; for if I had

 di&s;plea&s;ed the Duke, and he had wi&s;hed it, there is not a Campbell among you but would have been ready to bring John Wilkes's head to him in a charger. It would have been only
<Q><L>'Off with his head! So much for <HI>Ayle&s;bury.'</HI></L></Q>
I was then member for Ayle&s;bury."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on and Mr. Wilkes talked of the conte&s;ted pa&s;&s;age in Horace's <Q REND="inline">"Art of Poetry,"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Difficile e&s;t propri&egrave; communia dicere."</Q> Mr. Wilkes, according to my note, gave the interpretation thus: <Q REND="inline">"It is difficult to &s;peak with propriety of common things; as, if a poet had to &s;peak of Queen Caroline drinking tea, he mu&s;t endeavour to avoid the vulgarity of cups and &s;aucers."</Q> But upon reading my note, he tells me that he meant to &s;ay, that <Q REND="inline">"the word <HI>communia,</HI> being a Roman law term, &s;ignifies here things <HI>communis juris,</HI> that is to &s;ay, what have never yet been treated by any body; and this appears clearly from what followed,

It is neverthele&s;s true, as appears from Dr. Hurd the Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter's very elegant commentary and notes on the <Q REND="inline">"Epi&s;tola ad Pi&s;ones."</Q></P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to a fair con&s;ideration of the que&s;tion, that the whole pa&s;&s;age in which the words occur &s;hould be kept in view:</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>The <Q REND="inline">"Commentary"</Q> thus illu&s;trates it: <Q REND="inline">"But the formation of quite <HI>new characters</HI> is a work of great difficulty and hazard.</Q> For here there is no generally received and fixed <HI>archetype</HI> to work after, but every one <HI>judges</HI> of common right, according to the extent and comprehen&s;ion of his own idea; therefore he advi&s;es to labour and refit <HI>old characters and &s;ubjects,</HI> particularly tho&s;e made known and authori&s;ed by the practice of Homer and the Epick writers.</P>
<P>The <Q REND="inline">"Note"</Q> is,</P>

Yet, notwith&s;tanding the clearne&s;s of the ca&s;e, a late critick hath this &s;trange pa&s;&s;age. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Difficile quidem e&s;&s;e propri&egrave; communia dicere, hoc e&s;t, materiam vulgarem, notam et &egrave; medio petitam, ita immutare atque exornare, ut nova et &s;criptori propria videatur, ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> concedimus; et maximi procul dubio ponderis i&s;ta e&s;t ob&s;ervatio.

The contrary is implied in what he urges about the &s;uperiour difficulty of the latter, from which he di&s;&s;uades his country|men, only in re&s;pect of their abilities and inexperience in the&s;e matters; and in order to cultivate in them, which is the main view of the Epi&s;tle, a &s;pirit of correctne&s;s, by &s;ending them to the old &s;ubjects, treated by the Greek writers."</Q></P>
<P>For my own part (with all deference for Dr. Hurd, who thinks the <HI>ca&s;e clear,)</HI> I con&s;ider the pa&s;&s;age, <Q REND="inline">"Difficile e&s;t propri&egrave; communia dicere,"</Q> to be a <HI>crux</HI> for the criticks on Horace.</P>
<P>The explication which My Lord of Worce&s;ter treats with &s;o much contempt, is neverthele&s;s countenanced by authority which I find quoted by the learned Baxter, in his edition of Horace, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Difficile e&s;t propri&egrave; communia dicere,</HI> h. e. res vulgares di&s;ertis verbis enarrare, vel humile thema cum dignitate tractare. <HI>Difficile e&s;t communes res propriis explicare verbis.</HI> Vet. Schol."</Q></P>
<P>I was much di&s;appointed to find that the great critick, Dr. Bentley, has no note upon this very difficult pa&s;&s;age, as from his vigorous and illuminated mind I &s;hould have expected to receive more &s;atisfaction than I have yet had.</P>
<P>Sanadon <HI>thus treats of it,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Propri&egrave; communia dicere; c'e&s;t &agrave; dire qu'il n'e&s;t pas ai&s;&eacute; de former &agrave; ces per&s;onnages d'imagination des caract&ecirc;res particuliers et cependant vral&s;emblables.

<P>After all, I cannot help entertaining &s;ome doubt whether the words, <Q REND="inline">"Difficile e&s;t propri&egrave; communia dicere,"</Q> may not have been thrown in by Horace to form a <HI>&s;eparate</HI> article in a <Q REND="inline">"choice of difficulties"</Q> which a poet has to encounter, who choo&s;es a new &s;ubject; in which ca&s;e it mu&s;t be uncertain which of the various explanations is the true one, and every reader has a right to decide as it may &s;trike his own fancy. And even &s;hould the words be under&s;tood as they generally are, to be connected both with what goes before, and what comes after, the exact &s;en&s;e cannot be ab&s;olutely a&s;certained; for in&s;tance, whether <HI>propri&egrave;</HI> is meant to &s;ignify <HI>in an appropriated manner,</HI> as Dr. John&s;on here under&s;tands it, or, as it is often u&s;ed by Cicero, <HI>with propriety,</HI> or <HI>elegantly.</HI> In &s;hort, it is a rare in&s;tance of a defect in per&s;picuity in an admirable writer, who with almo&s;t every &s;pecies of excellence, is peculiarly remarkable for that quality. The length of this note perhaps requires an apology. Many of my readers, I doubt not, will admit that a critical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a pa&s;&s;age in a favourite cla&s;&s;ick is very engaging.</P></NOTE>.

<P>I talked a good deal to him of the celebrated Margaret Caroline Rudd, whom I had vi&s;ited, induced by the fame of her talents, addre&s;s, and irre&s;i&s;tible power of fa&s;cination. To a lady who di&s;approved of my vi&s;iting her, he &s;aid on a former occa&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Madam, Bo&s;well is in the right; I &s;hould have vi&s;ited her my&s;elf, were it not that they have now a trick of putting every thing into the new&s;papers."</Q> This evening he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"I envy him his acquaintance with Mrs. Rudd."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned a &s;cheme which I had of making a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">our to the I&s;le of Man, and giving a full account of it; and that Mr. Burk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ad playfully &s;ugge&s;ted as a motto,

<P>On the evening of the next day I took leave of him&punc; being to &s;et out for Scotland. I thanked him with great warmth for all his kindne&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) you are very welcome. Nobody repays it with more."</Q></P>
<P>How very fal&s;e is the notion which has gone round the world of the rough, and pa&s;&s;ionate, and har&s;h manners of this great and good man. That he had occa&s;ional &s;allies of heat of temper, and that he was &s;ometimes, perhaps, too <Q REND="inline">"ea&s;ily provoked"</Q> by ab&s;urdity and folly, and &s;ometimes too de&s;irous of triumph in colloquial conte&s;t, mu&s;t be allowed.

<P>I admit that the beadle within him was often &s;o eager to apply the la&s;h, that the Judge had not time to con&s;ider the ca&s;e with &s;ufficient deliberation.</P>
<P>That he was occa&s;ionally remarkable for violence of temper may be granted: but let us a&s;certain the degree, and not let it be &s;uppo&s;ed that he was in a perpetual rage, and never without a club in his hand, to knock down every one who approached him. On the contrary, the truth is, that by much the greate&s;t part of his time he was civil, obliging, nay, polite in the true &s;en&s;e of the word; &s;o much &s;o, that many gentlemen, who were long acquainted with him, never received, or even heard a &s;evere expre&s;&s;ion from him.</P>
<P>It was, I think, after I had left London this year, that an Epitaph, which Dr. John&s;on had written for the monument of Dr. Gold&s;mith in We&s;t|min&s;ter-Abbey, gave occa&s;ion to a <HI>Remon&s;trance</HI> to the MONARCH OF LITERATURE, for an account of which I am indebted to Sir William Forbes, of Pit&s;ligo.</P>

<Q><P>I enclo&s;e the <HI>Round Robin.</HI> This <HI>jeu d'e&s;prit</HI> took its ri&s;e one day at dinner at our friend Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's. All the company pre&s;ent, except my&s;elf, were friends and acquaintance of Dr. Gold&s;mith. The Epitaph, written for him by Dr. John&s;on, became the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation, and various emendations were &s;ugge&s;ted, which it was agreed &s;hould be &s;ubmitted to the Doctor's con&s;ideration.&mdash;But the que&s;tion was, who &s;hould have the courage to propo&s;e them to him? At la&s;t it was hinted, that there could be no way &s;o good as that of a <HI>Round Robin,</HI> as the &s;ailors call it, which they make u&s;e of when they enter into a con&s;piracy, &s;o as not to let it be known who puts his name fir&s;t or la&s;t to the paper. This propo&s;ition was in&s;tantly a&s;&s;ented to; and Dr. Barnard, Dean of Derry, now Bi&s;hop of Killaloe, drew up an addre&s;s to Dr. John&s;on on the occa&s;ion, replete with wit and humour, but which it was feared the Doctor might think treated the &s;ubject with too much levity. Mr. Burke then propo&s;ed the addre&s;s as it &s;tands in the paper in writing, to which I had the honour to officiate as clerk.</P>
<P>Sir Jo&s;hua agreed to carry it to Dr. John&s;on, who received it with much good humour <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">He however, upon &s;eeing Dr. Warton's name to the &s;ugge&s;tion that the Epitaph &s;hould be in Engli&s;h, ob&s;erved to Sir Jo&s;hua, <Q REND="inline">"I wonder that Joe Warton, a &s;cholar by profe&s;&s;ion, &s;hould be &s;uch a fool."</Q> Mr. Langton, who was one of the company at Sir Jo&s;hua's, like a &s;turdy &s;cholar, re&s;olutely refu&s;ed to &s;ign the <HI>Round Robin.</HI> The epitaph is engraved upon Dr. Gold&s;mith's monument without any alteration.</NOTE>, and de&s;ired Sir Jo&s;hua to tell the gentlemen, that he would alter the Epitaph in any manner they plea&s;ed, as to the &s;en&s;e of it; but <HI>he would never con&s;ent to di&s;grace the walls of We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey with an Engli&s;h in&s;cription.</HI></P>
<P>I con&s;ider this <HI>Round Robin</HI> as a &s;pecies of literary curio&s;ity worth pre|&s;erving, as it marks, in a certain degree, Dr. John&s;on's character.</P></Q>

Let us not throw any of our days away upon u&s;ele&s;s re&s;entment, or contend who &s;hall hold out longe&s;t in &s;tubborn malignity. It is be&s;t not to be angry, and be&s;t, in the next place, to be quickly reconciled. May you and your father pa&s;s the remainder of your time in reciprocal benevolence!</P>
<P>Do you ever hear from Mr. Langton? I vi&s;it him &s;ometimes, but he does not talk. I do not like his &s;cheme of life; but, as I am not permitted to under&s;tand it, I cannot &s;et any thing right that is wrong. His children are &s;weet babies.</P>
<P>I hope my irreconcileable enemy, Mrs. Bo&s;well, is well. De&s;ire her not to tran&s;mit her malevolence to the young people. Let me have Alexander, and Veronica, and Euphemia, for my friends.</P>
<P>Mrs. Williams, whom you may reckon as one of your well-wi&s;hers, is in a feeble and langui&s;hing &s;tate, with little hope of growing better. She went for &s;ome part of the autumn into the country, but is little benefited; and Dr. Lawrence confe&s;&s;es that his art is at an end. Death is, however, at a a di&s;tance; and what more than that can we &s;ay of our&s;elves? I am &s;orry for her pain, and more &s;orry for her decay. Mr. Levett is &s;ound, wind and limb.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="101" MS="y">
I was &s;ome weeks this autumn at Brighthelm&s;ton. The place was  very dull, and I was not well: the expedition to the Hebrides was the mo&s;t plea&s;ant journey that I ever made. Such an effort annually would give the world a little diver&s;ification.</P>
<P>Every year, however, we cannot wander, and mu&s;t therefore endeavour to &s;pend our time at home as well as we can. I believe it is be&s;t to throw life into a method, that every hour may bring its employment, and every employment have its hour. Xenophon ob&s;erves, in his 'Treati&s;e of Oeconomy,&punc; that if every thing be kept in a certain place, when any thing is worn out or con&s;umed, the vacuity which it leaves will &s;hew what is wanting; &s;o if every part of time has its duty, the hour will call into remembrance its proper engagement.</P>
<P>I have not practi&s;ed all this prudence my&s;elf, but I have &s;uffered much for want of it; and I would have you, by timely recollection and &s;teady re&s;o|lution, e&s;cape from tho&s;e evils which have lain heavy upon me.</P>

 variance at all is uncomfortable; and variance with a father is &s;till more uncomfortable. Be&s;ides that, in the whole di&s;pute you have the wrong &s;ide; at lea&s;t you gave the fir&s;t provocations, and &s;ome of them very offen&s;ive. Let it now be all over. As you have no rea&s;on to think that your new mother has &s;hown you any foul play, treat her with re&s;pect, and with &s;ome degree of confidence; this will &s;ecure your father. When once a di&s;cordant family has felt the plea&s;ure of peace, they will not willingly lo&s;e it. If Mrs. Bo&s;well would but be friends with me, we might now &s;hut the temple of Janus.</P>
<P>What came of Dr. Memis's cau&s;e? Is the que&s;tion about the negro determined? Has Sir Allan any rea&s;onable hopes? What is become of poor Macquarry? Let me know the event of all the&s;e litigations. I wi&s;h particu|larly well to the negro and Sir Allan.</P>
<P>Mrs. Williams has been much out of order; and though &s;he is &s;ome|thing better, is likely, in her phy&s;ician's opinion, to endure her malady for life, though &s;he may, perhaps, die of &s;ome other. Mrs. Thrale is big, and fancies that &s;he carries a boy; if it were very rea&s;onable to wi&s;h much about it, I &s;hould wi&s;h her not to be di&s;appointed. The de&s;ire of male heirs is not appendant only to feudal tenures. A &s;on is almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to the continu|ance of Thrale's fortune; for what can mi&s;&s;es do with a brewhou&s;e? Lands are fitter for daughters than trades.</P>
<P>Baretti went away from Thrale's in &s;ome whim&s;ical fit of di&s;gu&s;t, or ill-nature, without taking any leave. It is well if he finds in any other place as good an habitation, and as many conveniences. He has got five-and-twenty guineas by tran&s;lating Sir Jo&s;hua's Di&s;cour&s;es into Italian, and Mr. Thrale gave him an hundred in the &s;pring; &s;o that he is yet in no difficulties.</P>
<P>Colman has bought Foote's patent, and is to allow Foote for life &s;ixteen hundred pounds a year, as Reynolds told me, and to allow him to play &s;o often on &s;uch terms that he may gain four hundred pounds more. What Colman can get by this bargain, but trouble and hazard, I do not &s;ee.</P>

<P>The Reverend Dr. Hugh Blair, who had long been admired as a preacher at Edinburgh, thought now of diffu&s;ing his excellent &s;ermons more exten|&s;ively, and encrea&s;ing his reputation, by publi&s;hing a collection of them. He tran&s;mitted the manu&s;cript to Mr. Strahan, the printer, who after keeping it for &s;ome time, wrote a letter to him, di&s;couraging the publication. Such at

fir&s;t was the unpropitious &s;tate of one of the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful theological books  that has ever appeared. Mr. Strahan, however, had &s;ent one of the &s;ermons to Dr. John&s;on for his opinion; and after his unfavourable letter to Dr. Blair had been &s;ent off, he received from John&s;on on Chri&s;tmas-eve, a note in which was the following paragraph:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have read over Dr. Blair's fir&s;t &s;ermon with more than approbation; to &s;ay it is good, is to &s;ay too little."</Q></P>
<P>I believe Mr. Strahan had very &s;oon after this time a conver&s;ation with Dr. John&s;on concerning them, and then he very candidly wrote again to Dr. Blair, enclo&s;ing John&s;on's note, and agreeing to purcha&s;e the volume, for which he and Mr. Cadell gave one hundred pounds. The &s;ale was &s;o rapid and exten&s;ive, and the approbation of the publick &s;o high, that to their honour be it recorded, the proprietors made Dr. Blair a pre&s;ent fir&s;t of one &s;um, and afterwards of another, of fifty pounds, thus voluntarily doubling the &s;tipulated price; and when he prepared another volume they gave him at once three hundred pounds, being in all five hundred pounds, by an agreement to which I am a &s;ub&s;cribing witne&s;s; and now for a third octavo volume he has received no le&s;s than &s;ix hundred pounds.</P>

<P>MY &s;tate of epi&s;tolary accounts with you at pre&s;ent is extraordinary. The balance, as to number, is on your &s;ide. I am indebted to you for two letters; one dated the 16th of November, upon which very day I wrote to you, &s;o that our letters were exactly exchanged, and one dated the 21&s;t of December la&s;t.</P>
<P>My heart was warmed with gratitude by the truly kind contents of both of them; and it is amazing and vexing that I have allowed &s;o much time to elap&s;e without writing to you. But delay is inherent in me, by nature or by bad habit. I waited till I &s;hould have an opportunity of paying you my compliments on a new year. I have procra&s;tinated till the year is no longer new.</P>
<P>Dr. Memis's cau&s;e was determined again&s;t him, with 40l. co&s;ts. The Lord Pre&s;ident, and two other of the Judges, di&s;&s;ented from the majority upon this ground:&mdash;that although there may have been no intention to injure him by calling him <HI>Doctor of Medicine,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> yet as he remon|&s;trated again&s;t the de&s;ignation before the charter was printed off, and repre|&s;ented that it was di&s;agreeable and even hurtful to him, it was ill-natured to refu&s;e to alter it, and let him have the de&s;ignation to which he was certainly entitled. My own opinion is, that our court has judged wrong. The de|fendants were <HI>in mal&acirc; fide,</HI> to per&s;i&s;t in naming him in a way that he di&s;liked. You remember poor Gold&s;mith, when he grew important and wi&s;hed to appear <HI>Doctor Major,</HI> could not bear your calling him <HI>Goldy.</HI> Would it not have been wrong to have named him &s;o in your 'Preface to Shak&s;peare,' or in any &s;erious permanent writing of any &s;ort? The difficulty is, whether an action &s;hould be allowed on &s;uch petty wrongs. <HI>De minimis non curat lex.</HI></P>
<P>The Negro cau&s;e is not yet decided. A memorial is preparing on the &s;ide of &s;lavery. I &s;hall &s;end you a copy as &s;oon as it is printed. Maclaurin is made happy by your approbation of his memorial for the black.</P>
<P>Macquarry was here in the winter, and we pa&s;&s;ed an evening together. The &s;ale of his e&s;tate cannot be prevented.</P>
<P>Sir Allan Maclean's &s;uit again&s;t the Duke of Argyle, for recovering the ancient inheritance of his family, is now fairly before all our Judges. I &s;poke
<PB N="104" REF="106">
 for him ye&s;terday, and Maclaurin to-day; Cro&s;bie &s;poke to-day again&s;t him. Three more coun&s;el are to be heard, and next week the cau&s;e will be deter|mined. I &s;end you the <HI>Informations</HI> or <HI>Ca&s;es</HI> on each &s;ide, which I hope you will read. You &s;aid to me when we were under Sir Allan's ho&s;pitable roof, <Q REND="inline">'I will help him with my pen.'</Q> You &s;aid it with a generous glow; and though his Grace of Argyle did afterwards mount you upon an excellent hor&s;e, upon which <Q REND="inline">'you looked like a Bi&s;hop,'</Q> you mu&s;t not &s;werve from your purpo&s;e at Inchkenneth. I wi&s;h you may under&s;tand the points at i&s;&s;ue, amid&s;t our Scotch law principles and phra&s;es.</P>
<P>[Here followed a full &s;tate of the ca&s;e, in which I endeavoured to make it as clear as I could to an Engli&s;hman, who had no knowledge of the formularies and technical language of the law of Scotland.]</P>
<P>I &s;hall inform you how the cau&s;e is decided here. But as it may be brought under the review of our judges, and is certainly to be carried by appeal to the Hou&s;e of Lords, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch a mind as your's will be of con&s;equence. Your paper on <HI>Vicious Intromi&s;&s;ion</HI> is a noble proof of what you can do even in Scotch law.</P>
<P>I have not yet di&s;tributed all your books. Lord Hailes and Lord Monboddo have each received one, and return you thanks. Monboddo dined with me lately, and having drank tea, we were a good while by our&s;elves, and as I knew that he had read the 'Journey' &s;uperficially, as he did not talk of it as I wi&s;hed, I brought it to him, and read aloud &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages, and then he talked &s;o, that I told him he was to have a copy <HI>from the authour.</HI> He begged <HI>that</HI> might be marked on it.</P>

Indeed our country of Scotland, in &s;pite of the union of the crowns, is &s;till in mo&s;t places &s;o devoid of cloathing, or cover from hedges and plantations, that it was well you gave your readers a &s;ound <HI>monitoire</HI> with re&s;pect to that circum&s;tance. The truths you have told, and the purity of the language in which they are expre&s;&s;ed, as your 'Journey' is univer&s;ally read, may and already appear to have a very good effect. For a man of my acquaintance, who has the large&s;t nur&s;ery for trees and hedges in this country, tells me, that of late the demand upon him for the&s;e articles is doubled, and &s;ometimes tripled. I have, therefore, li&s;ted Dr. Samuel John&s;on in &s;ome of my memorandums of the principal planters and favourers of the enclo&s;ures, under a name which I took the liberty to invent from the Greek, <HI>Papadendrion.</HI> Lord Auchinleck and &s;ome few more are of the li&s;t.

I began my&s;elf to plant a little, our ground being too valuable for much, and that is now fifty years ago; and the trees, now in my &s;eventy-fourth year, I look up to with reverence, and &s;hew them to my elde&s;t &s;on, now in his fifteenth year, that they are full the heighth of my country-hou&s;e here, where I had the plea&s;ure of receiving you, and hope again to have that &s;atisfaction with our mutual friend, Mr. Bo&s;well.

<P>I think it hard that I &s;hould be a whole year without &s;eeing you. May I pre&s;ume to petition for a meeting with you in the autumn? You have, I believe, &s;een all the cathedrals in England, except that of Carli&s;le. If you are to be with Dr. Taylor, at A&s;hbourne, it would not be a great journey to come thither.

<P>You forget that Mr. Shaw's Er&s;e Grammar was put into your hands by my&s;elf la&s;t year. Lord Eglintoune put it into mine. I am glad that Mr. Macbean approves of it.

Mr. Shaw's Propo&s;als &dagger; for <Q REND="inline">"An Analy&s;is of the Scotch Celtick Language,"</Q>  were thus illuminated by the pen of John&s;on:</P>
<Q><P>THOUGH the Er&s;e dialect of the Celtick language has, from the earlie&s;t times, been &s;poken in Britain, and &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the northern parts and adjacent i&s;lands, yet, by the negligence of a people rather warlike than lettered, it has hitherto been left to the caprice and judgement of every &s;peaker, and has floated in the living voice, without the &s;teadine&s;s of analogy or direction of rules. An Er&s;e Grammar is an addition to the &s;tores of literature; and its authour hopes for the indulgence always &s;hewn to tho&s;e that attempt to do what was never done before. If his work &s;hall be found defective, it is at lea&s;t all his own: he is not like other grammarians, a com|piler or tran&s;criber; what he delivers, he has learned by attentive ob&s;ervation among his countrymen, who perhaps will be them&s;elves &s;urprized to &s;ee that &s;peech reduced to principles, which they have u&s;ed only by imitation.</P>

<P>THE &s;tory of Mr. Thrale's death, as he had neither been &s;ick nor in any other danger, made &s;o little impre&s;&s;ion upon me, that I never thought about obviating its effects on any body el&s;e. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been produced by the Engli&s;h cu&s;tom of making April fools, that is, of &s;ending one another on &s;ome fooli&s;h errand on the fir&s;t of April.</P>
<P>Tell Mrs. Bo&s;well that I &s;hall ta&s;te her marmalade cautiou&s;ly at fir&s;t, <HI>Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.</HI> Beware, &s;ays the Italian proverb, of a recon|ciled enemy. But when I find it does me no harm, I &s;hall then receive it and be thankful for it, as a pledge of firm, and, I hope, of unalterable kind|ne&s;s. She is, after all, a dear, dear lady.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e to return Dr. Blair thanks for his &s;ermons. The Scotch write Engli&s;h wonderfully well.</P>
<P>Your frequent vi&s;its to Auchinleck, and your &s;hort &s;tay there are very laudable and very judicious. Your pre&s;ent concord with your father gives me great plea&s;ure; it was all that you &s;eemed to want.</P>
<P>My health is very bad, and my nights are very unquiet. What can I do to mend them? I have for this &s;ummer nothing better in pro&s;pect than a journey into Stafford&s;hire and Derby&s;hire, perhaps with Oxford and Birmingham in my way.</P>

<P>To tho&s;e who delight in tracing the progre&s;s of works of literature, it will be an entertainment to compare the limited de&s;ign with the ample execution of that admirable performance, <Q REND="inline">"The Lives of the Engli&s;h Poets,"</Q> which is the riche&s;t, mo&s;t beautiful, and indeed mo&s;t perfect production of his pen. His notion of it at this time appears in the preceding letter. He has a memorandum in this year, <Q REND="inline">"29 May, Ea&s;ter-Eve, I treated with book&s;ellers on a bargain, but the time was not long <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 155.</NOTE>."</Q> The bargain was concerning that undertaking, but his tender con&s;cience &s;eems alarmed le&s;t it &s;hould have intruded too much on his devout preparation for the &s;olemnity of the en&s;uing day. But, indeed, very little time was nece&s;&s;ary for John&s;on's concluding a treaty with the Book&s;ellers; as he had, I believe, le&s;s attention to profit from his labours than any man to whom literature has been a profe&s;&s;ion. I &s;hall here in&s;ert from a letter to me from my late worthy friend Mr. Edward Dilly, though of a later date, an account of this plan &s;o happily conceived; &s;ince it was the occa&s;ion of procuring for us an elegant collection of the be&s;t biography and critici&s;m of which our language can boa&s;t.</P>

<P>YOU will find by this letter, that I am &s;till in the &s;ame calm retreat, from the noi&s;e and bu&s;tle of London, as when I wrote to you la&s;t. I am happy to find you had &s;uch an agreeable meeting with your old friend Dr. John&s;on; I have no doubt your &s;tock is much increa&s;ed by the interview; few men, nay I may &s;ay, &s;carcely any man has got that fund of knowledge and entertainment as Dr. John&s;on in conver&s;ation. When he opens freely, every one is attentive to what he &s;ays, and cannot fail of improvement as well as plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The edition of the Poets, now printing, will do honour to the Engli&s;h pre&s;s, and a conci&s;e account of the life of each authour, by Dr. John&s;on, will be a very valuable addition, and &s;tamp the reputation of this edition &s;uperior to any thing that is gone before. The fir&s;t cau&s;e that gave
<PB N="112" REF="114" MS="y">
 ri&s;e to this undertaking, I believe, was owing to the little trifling edition of the Poets, printing by the Martins, at Edinburgh, and to be &s;old by Bell, in London. Upon examining the volumes which were printed, the type was &s;ound &s;o extremely &s;mall, that many per&s;ons could not read them; not only this inconvenience attended it, but the inaccuracy of the pre&s;s was very con&s;picuous. The&s;e rea&s;ons, as well as the idea of an inva&s;ion of what we call our Literary Property, induced the London Book&s;ellers to print an elegant and accurate edition of all the Engli&s;h Poets of reputation, from Chaucer to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>Accordingly a &s;elect number of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable book&s;ellers met on the occa&s;ion, and, on con&s;ulting together, agreed, that all the proprietors of copy-right in the various Poets &s;hould be &s;ummoned together; and when their opinions were given, to proceed immediately on the bu&s;ine&s;s. Accordingly a meeting was held, con&s;i&s;ting of about forty of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable book|&s;ellers of London, when it was agreed that an elegant and uniform edition of 'The Engli&s;h Poets' &s;hould be immediately printed, with a conci&s;e account of the life of each author, by Dr. Samuel John&s;on; and that three per&s;ons &s;hould be deputed to wait upon Dr. John&s;on, to &s;olicit him to undertake the Lives, <HI>viz.</HI> T. Davies, Strahan, and Cadell. The Doctor very politely undertook it, and &s;eemed exceedingly plea&s;ed with the propo&s;al. As to the terms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t was left entirely to the Doctor&punc; to name his own: he mentioned two hundred guineas: it was immediately agreed to; and a farther com|pliment, I believe, will be made him. A committee was likewi&s;e appointed to engage the be&s;t engravers, <HI>viz.</HI> Bartolozzi, Sherwin, Hall, &amp;c. Likewi&s;e another committee for giving directions about the paper, printing, &amp;c. &s;o that the whole will be conducted with &s;pirit, and in the be&s;t manner, with re&s;pect to authour&s;hip, editor&s;hip, engravings, &amp;c. &amp;c. My brother will give you a li&s;t of the Poets we mean to give, many of which are within the time of the Act of Queen Anne, which Martin and Bell cannot give, as they have no property in them; the proprietors are almo&s;t all the book&s;ellers in London of con&s;equence.</P>

If you could give a hi&s;tory, though imperfect, of the Iri&s;h nation, from its conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity to the inva&s;ion from England, you would amplify knowledge with new views and new objects.

<P>A circum&s;tance which could not fail to be very plea&s;ing to John&s;on, occurred this year. The Tragedy of <Q REND="inline">"Sir Thomas Overbury,"</Q> written by his early companion in London, Richard Savage, was brought out with alterations at Drury-lane theatre.

<L>"No parent but the Mu&s;e, no friend but Heav'n:"</L></Q>

 he concluded with an elegant compliment to John&s;on on his Dictionary, that wonderful performance which cannot be too often or too highly prai&s;ed; of which Mr. Harris, in his <Q REND="inline">"Philological Inquiries <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Part Fir&s;t, Chap. 4.</NOTE>,"</Q> ju&s;tly and liberally ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline">"Such is its merit, that our language does not po&s;&s;e&s;s a more copious, learned, and valuable work."</Q> The concluding lines of this Prologue were the&s;e:</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>Mr. Sheridan here at once did honour to his ta&s;te and to his liberality of &s;entiment, by &s;hewing that he was not prejudiced from the unlucky difference which had taken place between his worthy father and Dr. John&s;on. I have already mentioned, that John&s;on was very de&s;irous of reconciliation with old Mr. Sheridan. It will, therefore, not &s;eem at all &s;urprizing that he was zealous in acknowledging the brilliant merit of his &s;on.

Since I re|ceived your letter, I have read his Life, publi&s;hed under the name of Cibber, but as you told me, really written by a Mr. Shiels; that written by Dr. Murdoch; one prefixed to an edition of the 'Sea&s;ons,' publi&s;hed at Edinburgh, which is compounded of both, with the addition of an anecdote of Quin's relieving Thom&s;on from pri&s;on; the abridgement of Murdoch's life of him, in the 'Biographia Britannica,' and another abridgement of it in the 'Biographical Dictionary,' enriched with Dr. Jo&s;eph Warton's critical panegyrick on the 'Sea&s;ons' in his 'E&s;&s;ay on the Genius and Writings of Pope:' from all the&s;e it appears to me that we have a pretty full account of this poet. However, you will, I doubt not, &s;hew me many blanks, and I &s;hall do what can be done to have them filled up. As Thom&s;on never returned to Scotland, (which <HI>you</HI> will think very wi&s;e,) his &s;i&s;ter can &s;peak from her own knowledge only as to the early part of his life. She has &s;ome letters from him, which may probably give light as to his more advanced progre&s;s, if &s;he will let us &s;ee them, which I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he will. I believe George Lewis Scott and Dr. Arm&s;trong are now his only &s;urviving companions, while he lived in and about London; and they, I dare &s;ay, can tell more of him than is yet known. My own notion is, that Thom&s;on was a much coar&s;er man than his friends are willing to acknowledge. His 'Sea&s;ons' are indeed full of elegant and pious &s;entiments: but a rank &s;oil, nay a dunghill, will produce beautiful flowers.</P>
<P>Your edition of the 'Engli&s;h Poets' will be very valuable, on account of the 'Prefaces and Lives.' But I have &s;een a &s;pecimen of an edition of the Poets at the Apollo pre&s;s, at Edinburgh, which, for excellence in printing and engraving, highly de&s;erves a liberal encouragement.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t &s;incerely do I regret the bad health and bad re&s;t with which you have been afflicted; and I hope you are better. I cannot believe that the prologue which you generou&s;ly gave to Mr. Kelly's widow and children the other day, is the effu&s;ion of one in &s;ickne&s;s and in di&s;quietude: but external circum&s;tances are never &s;ure indications of the &s;tate of man. I &s;end you a letter which I wrote to you two years ago at Wilton; and did not &s;end at the
<PB REF="120" MS="y">
 time, for fear of being reproved as indulging too much tenderne&s;s; and one written to you at the tomb of Melancthon, which I kept back, le&s;t I &s;hould appear at once too &s;uper&s;titious and too enthu&s;ia&s;tick. I now imagine that perhaps they may plea&s;e you.</P>
<P>You do not take the lea&s;t notice of my propo&s;al for our meeting at Carli&s;le. Though I have meritoriou&s;ly refrained from vi&s;iting London this year, I a&s;k you if it would not be wrong that I &s;hould be two years without having the benefit of your conver&s;ation, when, if you come down as far as Derbyfhire, we may meet at the expence of a few days journeying, and not many pounds. I wi&s;h you to &s;ee Carli&s;le, which made me mention that place. But if you have not a de&s;ire to complete your tour of the Engli&s;h cathedrals, I will take a larger &s;hare of the road between this place and A&s;hbourne. So tell me <HI>where</HI> you will fix for our pa&s;&s;ing a few days by our&s;elves. Now don't cry 'fooli&s;h fellow,' or 'idle dog.' Chain your humour, and let your kindne&s;s play.</P>
<P>You will rejoice to hear that Mi&s;s Macleod, of Ra&s;ay, is married to Colonel Mure Campbell, an excellent man, with a pretty good e&s;tate of his own, and the pro&s;pect of having the Earl of Loudoun's fortune and honours. Is not this a noble lot for our fair Hebridean? How happy am I that &s;he is to be in Ayr&s;hire. We &s;hall have the Laird of Ra&s;ay, and old Malcolm, and I know not how many gallant Macleods, and bagpipes, &amp;c. &amp;c. at Auchinleck. Perhaps you may meet them all there.</P>
<P>Without doubt you have read what is called 'The <HI>Life</HI> of David Hume,' written by him&s;elf, with the letter from Dr. Adam Smith &s;ubjoined to it. Is not this an age of daring effrontery? My friend Mr. Ander&s;on, Profe&s;&s;or of Natural Philo&s;ophy at Gla&s;gow, at who&s;e hou&s;e you and I &s;upped, and to who&s;e care Mr. Windham, of Norfolk, was entru&s;ted at that Univer&s;ity, paid me a vi&s;it lately; and after we had talked with indignation and contempt of the poi&s;onous productions with which this age is infe&s;ted, he &s;aid there was now an excellent opportunity for Dr. John&s;on to &s;tep forth. I agreed with him that you might knock Hume's and Smith's heads together, and make vain and o&s;tentatious infidelity exceedingly ridiculous. Would it not be worth your while to cru&s;h &s;uch noxious weeds in the moral garden?</P>
<P>You have &s;aid nothing to me of Dr. Dodd. I know not how you think on that &s;ubject; though the new&s;papers give us a &s;aying of yours in favour of mercy to him. But I own I am very de&s;irous that the royal prerogative of remi&s;&s;ion of puni&s;hment, &s;hould be employed to exhibit an illu&s;trious in&s;tance of the regard which GOD's VICEGERENT will ever &s;hew to
<PB N="119" REF="121" MS="y">
piety and virtue. If for ten righteous men the ALMIGHTY would have  &s;pared Sodom, &s;hall not a thou&s;and acts of goodne&s;s done by Dr. Dodd counterbalance one crime? Such an in&s;tance would do more to encourage goodne&s;s, than his execution would do to deter from vice. I am not afraid of any bad con&s;equence to &s;ociety; for who will per&s;evere for a long cour&s;e of years in a di&s;tingui&s;hed di&s;charge of religious duties, with a view to commit a forgery with impunity?</P>
<P>Pray make my be&s;t compliments acceptable to Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, by a&s;&s;uring them of my hearty joy that the <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> as you call him is alive. I hope I &s;hall often ta&s;te his Champagne&mdash;&s;oberly.</P>

<P>I HAVE ju&s;t received your packet from Mr. Thrale's, but have not day-light enough to look much into it. I am glad that I have credit enough with Lord Hailes to be tru&s;ted with more copy. I hope to take more care of it than of the la&s;t. I return Mrs. Bo&s;well my affectionate thanks for her pre&s;ent, which I value as a token of reconciliation.</P>
<P>Poor Dodd was put to death ye&s;terday, in oppo&s;ition to the recommenda|tion of the jury&mdash;the petition of the city of London&mdash;and a &s;ub&s;equent petition &s;igned by three-and-twenty thou&s;and hands. Surely the voice of the publick, when it calls &s;o loudly, and calls only for mercy, ought to be heard.</P>
<P>The &s;aying that was given me in the papers I never &s;poke; but I wrote many of his petitions, and &s;ome of his letters. He applied to me very often.
<PB N="120" REF="122">
 He was, I am afraid, long flattered with hopes of life; but I had no part in the dreadful delu&s;ion; for as &s;oon as the King had &s;igned his &s;entence, I obtained from Mr. Chamier an account of the di&s;po&s;ition of the court towards him, with a declaration that there was <HI>no hope even of a re&s;pite.</HI> This letter immediately was laid before Dodd; but he believed tho&s;e whom he wi&s;hed to be right, as it is thought, till within three days of his end. He died with pious compo&s;ure and re&s;olution. I have ju&s;t &s;een the Ordinary that attended him. His Addre&s;s to his fellow-convicts offended the Methodi&s;ts; but he had a Moravian with him much of his time. His moral character is very bad: I hope all is not true that is charged upon him.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR notion of the nece&s;&s;ity of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> yearly interview is very plea&s;ing to both my vanity and tenderne&s;s. I &s;hall, perhaps, come to Carli&s;le another year; but my money has not held out &s;o well as it u&s;ed to do. I &s;hall go to A&s;hbourne, and I purpo&s;e to make Dr. Taylor invite you. If you live awhile with me at his hou&s;e, we &s;hall have much time to our&s;elves, and our &s;tay will be no expence to us or him. I &s;hall leave London the 28th; and after &s;ome &s;tay at Oxford and Lichfield, &s;hall probably come to A&s;hbourne about the end of your Se&s;&s;ion, but of all this you &s;hall have notice. Be &s;atisfied we will meet &s;omewhere.</P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;ed between me and poor Dr. Dodd you &s;hall know more fully when we meet.</P>
<P>Of law&s;uits there is no end; poor Sir Allan mu&s;t have another trial, for which, however, his antagoni&s;t cannot be much blamed, having two judges on his &s;ide. I am more afraid of the debts than of the Hou&s;e of Lords. It is &s;carcely to be imagined to what debts will &s;well, that are daily encrea&s;ing by &s;mall additions, and how carele&s;sly in a &s;tate of de&s;peration debts are contracted. Poor Macquarry was far from thinking that when he &s;old his i&s;lands he &s;hould receive nothing. For what were they &s;old? And what was their yearly value? The admi&s;&s;ion of money into the Highlands will &s;oon put an end to the feudal modes of life, by making tho&s;e men landlords who were not chiefs. I do not know that the people will &s;uffer by the change, but there was in the patriarchal authority &s;omething venerable and plea&s;ing. Every eye mu&s;t look with pain on a <HI>Campbell</HI> turning the <HI>Macquarries</HI> at will out of their <HI>&s;edes avitae,</HI> their hereditary i&s;land.</P>
<P>Sir Alexander Dick is the only Scot&s;man liberal enough not to be angry that I could not find trees, where trees were not. I was much delighted by his kind letter.</P>
<P>I remember Ra&s;ay with too much plea&s;ure not to partake of the hap|pine&s;s of any part of that amiable family. Our ramble in the i&s;lands hangs
<PB N="126" REF="128" MS="y">

<P>You have done right in taking your unkle's hou&s;e. Some change in the form of life, gives from time to time a new epocha of exi&s;tence. In a new place there is &s;omething new to be done, and a different &s;y&s;tem of thoughts ri&s;es in the mind. I wi&s;h I could gather currants in your garden. Now fit up a little &s;tudy, and have your books ready at hand; do not &s;pare a little money, to make your habitation plea&s;ing to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have dined lately with poor dear&mdash;. I do not think he goes on well. His table is rather coar&s;e, and he has his children too much about him <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This very ju&s;t remark I hope will be con&s;tantly held in remembrance by parents, who are in general too apt to indulge their own fond feelings for their children at the expence of their friends. The common cu&s;tom of introducing them after dinner is highly injudicious. It is agreeable enough that they &s;hould appear at any other time; but they &s;hould not be &s;uffered to poi&s;on the moments of fe&s;tivity by attracting the attention of the company, and in a manner compelling them from politene&s;s to &s;ay what they do not &punc;think.</NOTE>. But he is a very good man.</P>
<P>Mrs. Williams is in the country to try if &s;he can improve her health; &s;he is very ill. Matters have come &s;o about that &s;he is in the country with very good accommodation; but, age and &s;ickne&s;s, and pride, have made her &s;o peevi&s;h that I was forced to bribe the maid to &s;tay with her, by a &s;ecret &s;tipulation of half a crown a week over her wages.</P>
<P>Our club ended its &s;e&s;&s;ion about &s;ix weeks ago. We now only meet to dine once a fortnight. Mr. Dunning, the great lawyer, is one of our members. The Thrales are well.</P>

<P>ON Saturday I wrote a very &s;hort letter, immediately upon my arrival hither, to &s;hew you that I am not le&s;s de&s;irous of the interview than your&s;elf. Life admits not of delays; when plea&s;ure can be had it is fit to catch

it: Every hour takes away part of the things that plea&s;e us, and perhaps part  of our di&s;po&s;ition to be plea&s;ed. When I came to Lichfield, I found my old friend Harry Jack&s;on dead. It was a lo&s;s, and a lo&s;s not to be repaired, as he was one of the companions of my childhood. I hope we may long continue to gain friends, but the friends which merit or u&s;efulne&s;s can procure us, are not able to &s;upply the place of old acquaintance, with whom the days of youth may be retraced, and tho&s;e images revived which gave the earlie&s;t delight. If you and I live to be much older, we &s;hall take great delight in talking over the Hebridean Journey.</P>
<P>In the mean time it may not be ami&s;s to contrive &s;ome other little adventure, but what it can be I know not; leave it, as Sidney &s;ays,
<Q><L>'To virtue, fortune, wine, and woman's brea&s;t;'</L></Q>
for I believe Mrs. Bo&s;well mu&s;t have &s;ome part in the con&s;ultation.</P>
<P>One thing you will like. The Doctor, &s;o far as I can judge, is likely to leave us enough to our&s;elves. He was out to-day before I came down, and, I fancy, will &s;tay out till dinner. I have brought the papers about poor Dodd, to &s;how you, but you will &s;oon have di&s;patched them.</P>
<P>Before I came away I &s;ent poor Mrs. Williams into the country, very ill of a pituitous defluxion, which wa&s;tes her gradually away, and which her phy&s;ician declares him&s;elf unable to &s;top. I &s;upplied her as far as could be de&s;ired, with all conveniencies to make her excur&s;ion and abode plea&s;ant and u&s;eful, but I am afraid &s;he can only linger a &s;hort time in a morbid &s;tate of weakne&s;s and pain.</P>
<P>The Thrales, little and great, are all well, and purpo&s;e to go to Bright|helm&s;ton at Michaelmas. They will invite me to go with them, and perhaps I may go, but I hardly think I &s;hall like to &s;tay the whole time; but of futurity we know but little.</P>
<P>Mrs. Porter is well; but Mrs. A&s;ton, one of the ladies at Stowhill, has been &s;truck with a pal&s;y, from which &s;he is not likely ever to recover. How &s;oon may &s;uch a &s;troke fall upon us!</P>

<P>[After informing him that I was to &s;et out next day, in order to meet him at A&s;hbourne:&mdash;]</P>
<P>I have a pre&s;ent for you from Lord Hailes; the fifth book of 'Lactantius,' which he has publi&s;hed with Latin notes. He is al&s;o to give you a few anecdotes for your 'Life of Thom&s;on,' who I find was private tutor to the pre&s;ent Earl of Hadington, Lord Hailes's cou&s;in, a circum&s;tance not mentioned by Dr. Murdoch. I have keen expectations of delight from your edition of the Engli&s;h Poets.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for poor Mrs. Williams's &s;ituation. You will, however, have the comfort of reflecting on your kindne&s;s to her. Mr. Jack&s;on's death, and Mrs. A&s;ton's pal&s;y, are gloomy circum&s;tances. Yet &s;urely we &s;hould be habituated to the uncertainty of life and health. When my mind is unclouded by melancholy, I con&s;ider the temporary di&s;tre&s;&s;es of this &s;tate of being, as light afflictions, by &s;tretching my mental view into that glorious after exi&s;tence, when they will appear to be as nothing. But pre&s;ent plea&s;ures and pre&s;ent pains mu&s;t be felt. I lately read 'Ra&s;&s;elas' over again with great &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Since you are de&s;irous to hear about Macquarry's &s;ale I &s;hall inform you particularly. The gentleman who purcha&s;ed Ulva is Mr. Campbell, of Auchnab&agrave;: our friend Macquarry was proprietor of two-thirds of it, of which the rent was 156l. 5s. 1d. 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">. This parcel was &s;et up at 4,069l. 15s. 1d. but it &s;old for no le&s;s than 5,540l. The other third of Ulva, with the i&s;land of Staffa, belonged to Macquarry of Ormaig. Its rent, including that of Staffa, 83l. 12s. 2d. 2/3&mdash;&s;et up at 2178l. 16s. 4d.&mdash;&s;old for no le&s;s than 3,540l. The Laird of Col wi&s;hed to purcha&s;e Ulva, but he thought the price too high. There may, indeed, be great improve|ments made there, both in fi&s;hing and agriculture; but the intere&s;t of the purcha&s;e-money exceeds the rents &s;o very much, that I doubt if the bargain will be profitable. There is an i&s;land called Little Colon&s;ay, of 10l. yearly rent, which I am informed has belonged to the Macquarrys of Ulva for many ages, but which was lately claimed by the Pre&s;byterian Synod of Argyll, in con&s;equence of a grant made to them by Queen Anne. It is believed that their claim will be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and that Little Colon&s;ay will al&s;o be &s;old for the advantage of Macquarry's creditors. What think you of

<P>On Sunday evening, September 14, I arrived at A&s;hbourne, and drove directly up to Dr. Taylor's door. Dr. John&s;on and he appeared before I had got out of the po&s;t-chai&s;e, and welcomed me cordially.</P>
<P>I told them that I had travelled all the preceding night, and gone to bed at Leek, in Stafford&s;hire; and that when I ro&s;e to go to church in the after|noon, I was informed there had been an earthquake, of which, it &s;eems, the &s;hock had been felt, in &s;ome degree, at A&s;hbourne. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it will be much exaggerated in popular talk: for, in the fir&s;t place, the common people do not accurately adapt their thoughts to the objects; nor, &s;econdly, do they accurately adapt their words to their thoughts: they do not mean to lie; but, taking no pains to be exact, they give you very fal&s;e accounts. A great part of their language is proverbial. If any thing rocks at all, they &s;ay <HI>it rocks like a cradle;</HI> and in this way they go on."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ubject of grief for the lo&s;s of relations and friends being introduced, I ob&s;erved that it was &s;trange to con&s;ider how &s;oon it in general wears away. Dr. Taylor mentioned a gentleman of the neighbourhod as the only in&s;tance he had ever known of a per&s;on who had endeavoured to <HI>retain</HI> grief. He told Dr. Taylor, that after his lady's death, which affected him deeply, he <HI>re&s;olved</HI> that the grief, which he cheri&s;hed with a kind of &s;acred fondne&s;s, &s;hould be la&s;ting; but that he found he could not keep it long. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"All grief for what cannot in the cour&s;e of nature be helped, &s;oon wears away; in &s;ome &s;ooner, indeed, in &s;ome later; but it never continues very long, unle&s;s where there is madne&s;s, &s;uch as will make a man have pride &s;o fixed in his
<PB N="133" REF="135" MS="y">
mind, as to imagine him&s;elf a King; or any other pa&s;&s;ion in an unrea&s;onable  way: for all unnece&s;&s;ary grief is unwi&s;e, and therefore will not be long retained by a &s;ound mind. If, indeed, the cau&s;e of our grief is occa&s;ioned by our own mi&s;conduct, if grief is mingled with remor&s;e of con&s;cience, it &s;hould be la&s;ting."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, we do not approve of a man who very &s;oon forgets the lo&s;s of a wife or a friend."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, we di&s;approve of him, not becau&s;e he &s;oon forgets his grief, for the &s;ooner it is forgotten the better, but becau&s;e we &s;uppo&s;e, that if he forgets his wife or his friend &s;oon, he has not had much affection for them."</Q></P>
<P>I was &s;omewhat di&s;appointed in finding that the edition of the Engli&s;h Poets, &s;or which he was to write Prefaces and Lives, was not an undertaking directed by him; but that he was to furni&s;h a Preface and Life to any poet the book&s;ellers plea&s;ed. I a&s;ked him if he would do this to any dunce's works, if they &s;hould a&s;k him. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; and <HI>&s;ay</HI> he was a dunce."</Q> My friend &s;eemed now not much to reli&s;h talking of this edition.</P>
<P>On Monday, September 15, Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved, that every body com|mended &s;uch parts of his <Q REND="inline">"Journey to the We&s;tern I&s;lands,"</Q> as were in their own way. <Q REND="inline">"For in&s;tance, (&s;aid he,) Mr. Jack&s;on (the all-knowing) told me, there was more good &s;en&s;e upon trade in it, than he &s;hould hear in the Hou&s;e of Commons in a year, except from Burke. Jones commended the part which treats of language; Burke that which de&s;cribes the inhabitants of mountainous countries."</Q></P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, John&s;on carried me to &s;ee the garden belonging to the &s;chool of A&s;hbourne, which is very prettily formed upon a bank, ri&s;ing gradually behind the hou&s;e. The Reverend Mr. Langley, the head ma&s;ter, accompanied us.</P>
<P>While we &s;at ba&s;king in the &s;un upon a &s;eat here, I introduced a common &s;ubject of complaint, the very &s;mall &s;alaries which many curates have, and I maintained, <Q REND="inline">"that no man &s;hould be inve&s;ted with the character of a clergy|man, unle&s;s he has a &s;ecurity for &s;uch an income as will enable him to appear re&s;pectable; that, therefore, a clergyman &s;hould not be allowed to have a curate, unle&s;s he gives him a hundred pounds a year; if he cannot do that, let him perform the duty him&s;elf."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure, Sir, it is wrong that any clergyman &s;hould be without a rea&s;onable income; but as the church revenues were &s;adly dimini&s;hed at the Reformation, the clergy who have livings cannot afford, in many in&s;tances, to gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> good &s;alaries to curates, without leaving them&s;elves too little; and, if no curate were to be permitted, unle&s;s he had a hundred pounds a year, their number would be
<PB N="134" REF="136" MS="y">
 very &s;mall, which would be a di&s;advantage, as then there would not be &s;uch choice in the nur&s;ery for the church, curates being candidates for the higher eccle&s;ia&s;tical offices, according to their merit and good behaviour."</Q> He explained the &s;y&s;tem of the Engli&s;h Hierarchy exceedingly well. <Q REND="inline">"It is not thought fit (&s;aid he) to tru&s;t a man with the care of a pari&s;h, till he has given proof as a curate that he &s;hall de&s;erve &s;uch a tru&s;t."</Q> This is an excel|lent <HI>theory;</HI> and if the <HI>practice</HI> were according to it, the Church of England would be admirable indeed. However, as I have heard Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erve as to the Univer&s;ities, bad practice does not infer that the <HI>con&s;titution</HI> is bad.</P>
<P>We had with us at dinner &s;everal of Dr. Taylor's neighbours, good civil gentlemen, who &s;eemed to under&s;tand Dr. John&s;on very well, and not to con&s;ider him in the light that a certain per&s;on did, who being &s;truck, or rather &s;tunned by his voice and manner, when he was afterwards a&s;ked what he thought of him, an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"He's a tremendous companion."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on told me, that <Q REND="inline">"Taylor was a very &s;en&s;ible acute man, and had a &s;trong mind; that he had great activity in &s;ome re&s;pects, and yet &s;uch a &s;ort of indolence, that if you &s;hould put a pebble upon his chimney-piece, you would find it there, in the &s;ame &s;tate, a year afterwards."</Q></P>
<P>And here is the proper place to give an account of John&s;on's humane and zealous interference in behalf of the Reverend Dr. William Dodd, formerly Prebendary of Brecon, and chaplain in ordinary to his Maje&s;ty; celebrated as a very popular preacher, an encourager of charitable in&s;titutions, and authour of a variety of works, chiefly theological. Having unhappily con|tracted expen&s;ive habits of living, partly occa&s;ioned by licentiou&s;ne&s;s of manners, he in an evil hour, when pre&s;&s;ed by want of money, and dreading an expo&s;ure of his circum&s;tances, forged a bond of which he attempted to avail him&s;elf to &s;upport his credit, flattering him&s;elf with hopes that he might be able to repay its amount without being detected. The per&s;on, who&s;e name he thus ra&s;hly and criminally pre&s;umed to fal&s;ify, was the Earl of Che&s;terfield, to whom he had been tutor, and who, he perhaps, in the warmth of his feelings, flattered him&s;elf would have paid the money in ca&s;e of an alarm being taken, rather than &s;uffer him to fall a victim to the dreadful con&s;equences of violating the law again&s;t forgery, the mo&s;t dangerous crime in a commercial country; but the unfortunate divine had the mortification to find that he was mi&s;taken. His noble pupil appeared again&s;t him, and he was capitally convicted.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="137" MS="y">
John&s;on told me that Dr. Dodd was very little acquainted with him, having  been but once in his company, many years previous to this period (which was preci&s;ely the &s;tate of my own acquaintance with Dodd); but in his di&s;tre&s;s he bethought him&s;elf of John&s;on's per&s;ua&s;ive power of writing, if haply it might avail to obtain for him the royal mercy. He did not apply to him directly, but, extraordinary as it may &s;eem, through the late Counte&s;s of Harrington, who wrote a letter to John&s;on, a&s;king him to employ his pen in favour of Dodd. Mr. Allen, the printer, who was John&s;on's landlord and next neighbour in Bolt-court, and for whom he had much kindne&s;s, was one of Dodd's friends, of whom, to the credit of humanity be it recorded, that he had many who did not de&s;ert him, even after his infringement of the law had reduced him to the &s;tate of a man under &s;entence of death. Mr. Allen told me that he carried Lady Harrington's letter to John&s;on, that John&s;on read it walking up and down his chamber, and &s;eemed much agitated, after which he &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"I will do what I can;&mdash;"</Q> and certainly he did make extraordinary exertions.</P>
<P>He this evening, as he had obligingly promi&s;ed in one of his letters, put into my hands the whole &s;eries of his writings upon this melancholy occa&s;ion, and I &s;hall pre&s;ent my readers with the ab&s;tract which I made from the col|lection; in doing which I &s;tudied to avoid copying what had appeared in print, and now make part of the edition of <Q REND="inline">"John&s;on's Works,"</Q> publi&s;hed by the Book&s;ellers of London, but taking care to mark John&s;on's variations in &s;ome of the pieces there exhibited.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on wrote in the fir&s;t place, Dr. Dodd's <Q REND="inline">"Speech to the Recorder of London,"</Q> at the Old-Bailey, when &s;entence of death was about to be pro|nounced upon him.</P>
<P>He wrote al&s;o <Q REND="inline">"The Convict's Addre&s;s to his unhappy Bretheren,"</Q> a &s;ermon delivered by Dr. Dodd, in the chapel of Newgate. According to John&s;on's manu&s;cript it began thus after the text, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The&s;e were the words with which the keeper, to who&s;e cu&s;tody Paul and Silas were committed by their pro&s;ecutors, addre&s;&s;ed his pri&s;oners, when he &s;aw them freed from their bonds by the perceptible agency of divine favour, and was, therefore, irre&s;i&s;tibly convinced that they were not offenders again&s;t the laws, but martyrs to the truth."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on was &s;o good as to mark for me with his own hand, on a copy of this &s;ermon which is now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as were added by Dr. Dodd. They are not many: Whoever will take the trouble to look at the printed copy and attend to what I mention, will be &s;atisfied of this.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="138" MS="y">
 There is a &s;hort introduction by Dr. Dodd, and he al&s;o in&s;erted this &s;en|tence, <Q REND="inline">"You &s;ee with what confu&s;ion and di&s;honour I now &s;tand before you;&mdash;no more in the pulpit of in&s;truction, but on this humble &s;eat with your&s;elves."</Q> The <HI>notes</HI> are entirely Dodd's own, and John&s;on's writing ends at the words, <Q REND="inline">"the thief whom he pardoned on the cro&s;s."</Q> What follows was &s;upplied by Dr. Dodd him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The other pieces written by John&s;on in the above mentioned collection, are two letters, one to the Lord Chancellor Bathur&s;t (not Lord North, as is erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed) and one to Lord Mansfield;&mdash;A Petition from Dr. Dodd to the King;&mdash;A Petition from Mrs. Dodd to the Queen;&mdash;Ob|&s;ervations of &s;ome length in&s;erted in the new&s;papers, on occa&s;ion of Earl Percy's having pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty a petition for mercy to Dodd, &s;igned by twenty thou&s;and people, but all in vain. He told me that he had al&s;o written a petition from the city of London; <Q REND="inline">"but (&s;aid he, with a &s;ignificant &s;mile) they <HI>mended</HI> it."</Q></P>
<P>The la&s;t of the&s;e articles which John&s;on wrote is <Q REND="inline">"Dr. Dodd's la&s;t &s;olemn Declaration,"</Q> which he left with the &s;heriff at the place of execution. Here al&s;o my friend marked the variations on a copy of that piece now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Dodd in&s;erted, <Q REND="inline">"I never knew or attended to the calls of frugality, or the needful minutene&s;s of painful oeconomy;"</Q> and in the next &s;entence he in|troduced the words which I di&s;tingui&s;h by <HI>Italicks,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"My life for &s;ome <HI>few unhappy</HI> years pa&s;t has been <HI>dreadfully erroneous.</HI>"</Q> John&s;on's expre&s;&s;ion was <HI>hypocritical;</HI> but his remark on the margin is <Q REND="inline">"With this he &s;aid he could not charge him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>Having thus authentically &s;ettled what part of the <Q REND="inline">"Occa&s;ional Papers,"</Q> concerning Dr. Dodd's mi&s;erable &s;ituation, came from the pen of John&s;on, I &s;hall proceed to pre&s;ent my readers with my record of the unpubli&s;hed writings relating to that extraordinary and intere&s;ting matter.</P>
<P>I found a letter to Dr. John&s;on from Dr. Dodd, May 23, 1777, in which <Q REND="inline">"The Convict's Addre&s;s"</Q> &s;eems clearly to be meant:</P>
<Q><P>I am &s;o penetrated, my ever dear Sir, with a &s;en&s;e of your extreme benevolence towards me, that I cannot find words equal to the &s;entiments of my heart.</P>
<P>You are too conver&s;ant in the world to need the &s;lighte&s;t hint from me, of what infinite utility the Speech<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">His Speech at the Old-Bailey, when found guilty.</NOTE> on the aweful day has been to me. I experience, every hour, &s;ome good effect from it. I am &s;ure that effects &s;till

more &s;alutary and important, mu&s;t follow from <HI>your kind and intended favour.</HI>  I will labour,&mdash;GOD being my helper,&mdash;to do ju&s;tice to it from the pulpit.

<P>He added, <Q REND="inline">"May GOD ALMIGHTY ble&s;s and reward, with his choice&s;t comforts, your philanthropick actions, and enable me at all times to expre&s;s what I feel of the high and uncommon obligations which I owe to the <HI>fir&s;t man</HI> in our times."</Q></P>
<P>On Sunday, June 22, he writes, begging Dr. John&s;on's a&s;&s;i&s;tance in framing a &s;upplicatory letter to his Maje&s;ty:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If his Maje&s;ty could be moved of his royal clemency to &s;pare me and my family the horrours and ignominy of a <HI>publick death,</HI> which the <HI>publick</HI> it&s;elf is &s;olicitous to wave, and to grant me in &s;ome &s;ilent di&s;tant corner of the globe, to pa&s;s the remainder of my days in penitence and prayer, I would ble&s;s his clemency and be humbled."</Q></P>
<P>This letter was brought to Dr. John&s;on when in church. He &s;tooped down and read it, and wrote, when he went home, the following letter for Dr. Dodd to the King:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MAY it not offend your Maje&s;ty, that the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of men applies him&s;elf to your clemency, as his la&s;t hope and his la&s;t refuge; that your mercy is mo&s;t earne&s;tly and humbly implored by a clergyman, whom your Laws and Judges have condemned to the horrour and ignominy of a publick execution.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s the crime, and own the enormity of its con&s;equences, and the danger of its example. Nor have I the confidence to petition for impunity; but humbly hope, that publick &s;ecurity may be e&s;tabli&s;hed, without the &s;pectacle of a clergyman dragged through the &s;treets, to a death of infamy, amid&s;t the deri&s;ion of the profligate and profane; and that ju&s;tice may be &s;atisfied with irrevocable exile, perpetual di&s;grace, and hopele&s;s penury.</P>
<P>My life, Sir, has not been u&s;ele&s;s to mankind. I have benefited many. But my offences again&s;t GOD are numberle&s;s, and I have had little time for repentance.

<P>I MOST &s;eriou&s;ly enjoin you not to let it be at all known that I have written this letter, and to return the copy to Mr. Allen in a cover to me. I hope I need not tell you, that I wi&s;h it &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;But do not indulge hope.&mdash;Tell nobody.</P>
</LETTER>It happened luckily that Mr. Allen was pitched on to a&s;&s;i&s;t in this melan|choly office, for he was a great friend of Mr. Akerman, the keeper of Newgate. Dr. John&s;on never went to &s;ee Dr. Dodd. He &s;aid to me, it would have done <HI>him</HI> more harm, than good to Dodd, who once expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to &s;ee him, but not earne&s;tly.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on, on the 20th of June, wrote the following letter:</P>
<P><LETTER LANG="eng">

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE the conviction and condemnation of Dr. Dodd, I have had, by the intervention of a friend, &s;ome intercour&s;e with him, and I am &s;ure I &s;hall lo&s;e nothing in your opinion by tenderne&s;s and commi&s;eration. Whatever be the crime, it is not ea&s;y to have any knowledge of the delin|quent without a wi&s;h that his life may be &s;pared, at lea&s;t when no life has been taken away by him. I will, therefore, take the liberty of &s;ugge&s;ting &s;ome rea&s;ons for which I wi&s;h this unhappy being to e&s;cape the utmo&s;t rigour of his &s;entence.</P>
<P>He is, &s;o far as I can recollect, the fir&s;t clergyman of our church who has &s;uffered publick execution for immorality; and I know not whether it would not be more for the intere&s;t of religion to bury &s;uch an offender in the ob&s;curity of perpetual exile, than to expo&s;e him in a cart, and on the gallows, to all who for any rea&s;on are enemies to the clergy.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="141">
The &s;upreme power has, in all ages, paid &s;ome attention to the voice of  the people; and that voice does not lea&s;t de&s;erve to be heard, when it calls out for mercy. There is now a very general de&s;ire that Dodd's life &s;hould be &s;pared. More is not wi&s;hed; and, perhaps, this is not too much to be granted.</P>
<P>If you, Sir, have any opportunity of enforcing the&s;e rea&s;ons; you may, perhaps, think them worthy of con&s;ideration: but whatever you determine, I mo&s;t re&s;pectfully intreat that you will be plea&s;ed to pardon for this intru|&s;ion,</P>

<P>It has been confidently circulated, with invidious remarks, that to this letter no attention whatever was paid by Mr. Jenkin&s;on, now Lord Hawke&s;bury; and that he did not even deign to &s;hew the common civility of owning the receipt of it. I could not but wonder at &s;uch conduct in the noble Lord, who&s;e own character and ju&s;t elevation in life, I thought, mu&s;t have impre&s;&s;ed him with all due regard for great abilities and attainments. As the &s;tory had been much talked of, and apparently from good authority, I could not but have animadverted upon it in this work, had it been as was alledged; but from my earne&s;t love of truth, and having found rea&s;on to think that there might be a mi&s;take, I pre&s;umed to write to his Lord&s;hip, reque&s;ting an explanation; and it is with the &s;incere&s;t plea&s;ure that I am enabled to a&s;&s;ure the world, that there is no foundation for it, the fact being, that owing to &s;ome neglect, or accident, John&s;on's letter never came to Lord Hawke&s;bury's hands. I &s;hould have thought it &s;trange indeed, if that noble Lord had undervalued my illu&s;trious friend; but in&s;tead of this being the ca&s;e, his Lord&s;hip, in the very polite an&s;wer with which he was plea&s;ed immediately to honour me, thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have always re&s;pected the memory of Dr. John&s;on, and admire his writings; and I frequently read many parts of them with plea&s;ure and great improve|ment."</Q></P>
<P>All applications for the Royal Mercy having failed, Dr. Dodd prepared him&s;elf for death; and, with a warmth of gratitude, wrote to Dr. John&s;on as follows:

<P>Under the copy of this letter I found written, in John&s;on's own hand, <Q REND="inline">"Next day, June 27, he was executed."</Q></P>
<P>To conclude this intere&s;ting epi&s;ode with an u&s;eful application, let us now attend to the reflections of John&s;on at the end of the <Q REND="inline">"Occa&s;ional Papers,"</Q> concerning the unfortunate Dr. Dodd.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Such were the la&s;t thoughts of a man whom we have &s;een exulting in popularity, and &s;unk in &s;hame. For
<PB N="141" REF="143" MS="y">
his reputation, which no man can give to him&s;elf, tho&s;e who conferred it are  to an&s;wer. Of his publick mini&s;try the means of judging were &s;ufficiently attainable. He mu&s;t be allowed to preach well, who&s;e &s;ermons &s;trike his audience with forcible conviction. Of his life, tho&s;e who thought it con|&s;i&s;tent with his doctrine did not originally form fal&s;e notions. He was at fir&s;t what he endeavoured to make others; but the world broke down his re&s;olu|tion, and he in time cea&s;ed to exemplify his own in&s;tructions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"Let tho&s;e who are tempted to his faults, tremble at his puni&s;hment; and tho&s;e whom he impre&s;&s;ed from the pulpit with religious &s;entiments, endeavour to confirm them by con&s;idering the regret and &s;elf-abhorrence with which he reviewed in pri&s;on his deviations from rectitude."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on gave us this evening, in his happy di&s;criminative manner, a portrait of the late Mr. Fitzherbert, of Derby&s;hire. <Q REND="inline">"There was (&s;aid he) no &s;parkle, no brilliancy in Fitzherbert; but I never knew a man who was &s;o generally acceptable. He made every body quite ea&s;y, overpowered nobody by the &s;uperiority of his talents, made no man think wor&s;e of him&s;elf by being his rival, &s;eemed always to li&s;ten, did not oblige you to hear much from him, and did not oppo&s;e what you &s;aid. Every body liked him; but he had no friend, as I under&s;tand the word, nobody with whom he exchanged intimate thoughts. People were willing to think well of every thing about him. A gen|tleman was making an affected rant, as many people do, of great feelings about 'his dear &s;on,' who was at &s;chool near London; how anxious he was le&s;t he might be ill, and what he would give to &s;ee him. 'Can't you (&s;aid Fitzherbert) take a po&s;t-chai&s;e and go to him?' This, to be &s;ure, <HI>fini&s;hed</HI> the affected man, but there was not much in it. However this was circulated as wit for a whole winter, and I believe part of a &s;ummer too; a proof that he was no very witty man. He was an in&s;tance of the truth of the ob&s;erva|tion, that a man will plea&s;e more upon the whole by negative qualities than by po&s;itive; by never offending, than by giving a great deal of delight. In the fir&s;t place, men hate more &s;teadily than they love; and if I have &s;aid &s;omething to hurt a man once, I &s;hall not get the better of this by &s;aying many things to plea&s;e him."</Q></P>
<P>Tue&s;day, September 16, Dr. John&s;on having mentioned to me the extra|ordinary &s;ize and price of &s;ome cattle reared by Dr. Taylor, I rode out with our ho&s;t, &s;urveyed his farm, and was &s;hown one cow which he had &s;old for a hundred and twenty guineas, and another for which he had been offered a hundred and thirty. Taylor thus de&s;cribed to me his old &s;choolfellow and
<PB N="142" REF="144" MS="y">
 friend, John&s;on: <Q REND="inline">"He is a man of a very clear head, great power of words, and a very gay imagination; but there is no di&s;puting with him. He will not hear you, and having a louder voice than you, mu&s;t roar you down."</Q></P>
<P>In the afternoon I tried to get Dr. John&s;on to like the Poems of Mr. Hamilton of Bangour, which I had brought with me: I had been much plea&s;ed with them at a very early age; the impre&s;&s;ion &s;till remained on my mind: it was confirmed by the opinion of my friend the Honourable Andrew Er&s;kine, him&s;elf both a good poet and a good critick, who thought Hamilton as true a poet as ever wrote, and that his not having fame was unaccountable. John&s;on upon repeated occa&s;ions, while I was at A&s;hbourne, talked &s;lightingly of Hamilton. He &s;aid there was no power of thinking in his ver&s;es, nothing that &s;trikes one, nothing better than what you generally find in magazines; and that the highe&s;t prai&s;e they de&s;erved was, that they were very well for a gen|tleman to hand about among his friends. He &s;aid the imitation of <HI>Ne &s;it ancillae tibi amor</HI> &amp;c. was too &s;olemn; he read part of it at the beginning. He read the beautiful pathetick &s;ong, <Q REND="inline">"Ah the poor &s;hepherd's mournful fate,"</Q> and did not &s;eem to give attention to what I had been u&s;ed to think tender elegant &s;trains, but laughed at the rhyme, in Scotch pronunciation, <HI>wi&s;hes</HI> and <HI>blu&s;hes,</HI> reading <HI>wu&s;hes</HI>&mdash;and there he &s;topped. He owned that the epitaph on Lord Newhall was pretty well done. He read the <Q REND="inline">"In&s;cription in a Summer-hou&s;e,"</Q> and a little of the imitations of Horace's Epi&s;tles; but &s;aid, he found nothing to make him de&s;ire to read on. When I urged that there were &s;ome good poetical pa&s;&s;ages in the book. <Q REND="inline">"Where (&s;aid he) will you find &s;o large a collection without &s;ome."</Q> I thought the de&s;cription of Winter might obtain his approbation:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"See Winter, from the frozen north,</L>
<L>"Drives his iron chariot forth!</L>
<L>"His gri&s;ly hand in icy chains</L>
<L>"Fair Tweeda's &s;ilver &s;lood con&s;trains," &amp;c.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>He a&s;ked why an <Q REND="inline">"<HI>iron</HI> chariot;"</Q> and &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"icy chains"</Q> was an old image. I was &s;truck with the uncertainty of ta&s;te, and &s;omewhat &s;orry that a poet whom I had long read with fondne&s;s, was not approved by Dr. John&s;on. I comforted my&s;elf with thinking that the beauties were too delicate for his robu&s;t perceptions. Garrick maintained that he had not a ta&s;te for the fine&s;t productions of genius: but I was &s;en&s;ible, that when he took the trouble to analy&s;e critically, he generally convinced us that he was right.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145" MS="y">
In the evening, the Reverend Mr. Seward, of Lichfield, who was pa&s;&s;ing  through A&s;hbourne in his way home, drank tea with us. John&s;on de&s;cribed him thus:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sir, his ambition is to be a fine talker; &s;o he goes to Buxton, and &s;uch places, where he may find companies to li&s;ten to him. And, Sir, he is a valetudinarian, one of tho&s;e who are always mending them&s;elves. I do not know a more di&s;agreeable character than a valetudinarian, who thinks he may do any thing that is for his ea&s;e, and indulges him&s;elf in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t freedoms: Sir, he brings him&s;elf to the &s;tate of a hog in a &s;tye."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Taylor's no&s;e happening to bleed, he &s;aid, it was becau&s;e he had omitted to have him&s;elf blooded four days after a quarter of a year's interval. Dr. John&s;on, who was a great dabbler in phy&s;ick, di&s;approved much of periodical bleeding. <Q REND="inline">"For (&s;aid he) you accu&s;tom your&s;elf to an evacuation which Nature cannot perform of her&s;elf, and therefore &s;he cannot help you, &s;hould you, from forgetfulne&s;s or any other cau&s;e, omit it; &s;o you may be &s;uddenly &s;uffocated. You may accu&s;tom your&s;elf to other periodical evacuations, becau&s;e &s;hould you omit them, Nature can &s;upply the omi&s;&s;ion; but Nature cannot open a vein to blood you."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I do not like to take an emetick, (&s;aid Taylor,) for fear of breaking &s;ome &s;mall ve&s;&s;els."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Poh! (&s;aid John&s;on) if you have &s;o many things that will break, you had better break your neck at once, and there's an end on't. You will break no &s;mall ve&s;&s;els."</Q> (blowing with high deri&s;ion).</P>
<P>I mentioned to Dr. John&s;on, that David Hume's per&s;i&s;ting in his infidelity, when he was dying, &s;hocked me much. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why &s;hould it &s;hock you, Sir? Hume owned he had never read the New Te&s;tament with attention. Here then was a man who had been at no pains to inquire into the truth of religion, and had continually turned his mind the other way. It was not to be expected that the pro&s;pect of death would alter his way of thinking, unle&s;s GOD &s;hould &s;end an angel to &s;et him right."</Q> I &s;aid, I had rea&s;on to believe that the thought of annihilation gave Hume no pain. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It was not &s;o, Sir. He had a vanity in being thought ea&s;y. It is more probable that he &s;hould a&s;&s;ume an appearance of ea&s;e, than that &s;o very improbable a thing &s;hould be, as a man not afraid of going (as, in &s;pite of his delu&s;ive theory, he cannot be &s;ure but he may go,) into an unknown &s;tate, and not being unea&s;y at leaving all he knew. And you are to con&s;ider, that upon his own principle of annihilation he had no motive to &s;peak the truth."</Q> The horrour of death which I had always ob&s;erved in Dr. John&s;on, appeared &s;trong to-night. I ventured to tell him, that I had been, for moments of my life, not afraid of death; therefore I could &s;uppo&s;e another man in that &s;tate of mind for a
<PB N="144" REF="146" MS="y">
 con&s;iderable &s;pace of time. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"he never had a moment in which death was not terrible to him."</Q> He added, that it had been ob&s;erved, that almo&s;t no man dies in publick, but with apparent re&s;olution; from that de&s;ire of prai&s;e which never quits us. I &s;aid, Dr. Dodd &s;eemed to be willing to die, and full of hopes of happine&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) Dr. Dodd would have given both his hands and both his legs to have lived. The better a man is, the more afraid is he of death, having a clearer view of infinite purity."</Q> He owned, that our being in an unhappy uncertainty as to our &s;alvation, was my&s;terious; and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! we mu&s;t wait till we are in another &s;tate of being, to have many things explained to us."</Q> Even the powerful mind of John&s;on &s;eemed foiled by futurity. But I thought, that the gloom of uncertainty in &s;olemn religious &s;peculation, being mingled with hope, was yet more con&s;olatory than the emptine&s;s of infidelity. A man can live in thick air, but peri&s;hes in an exhau&s;ted receiver.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on was much plea&s;ed with a remark which I told him was made to me by General Paoli:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That it is impo&s;&s;ible not to be afraid of death; and that tho&s;e who at the time of dying are not afraid, are not thinking of death, but of applau&s;e, or &s;omething el&s;e, which keeps death out of their &s;ight: &s;o that all men are equally afraid of death when they &s;ee it; only &s;ome have a power of turning their &s;ight away from it better than others."</Q></P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, September 17, Dr. Butter, phy&s;ician at Derby, drank tea with us; and it was &s;ettled that Dr. John&s;on and I &s;hould go on Friday and dine with him. John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I'm glad of this."</Q> He &s;eemed weary of the uniformity of life at Dr. Taylor's.</P>
<P>Talking of biography, I &s;aid, in writing a life a man's peculiarities &s;hould be mentioned, becau&s;e they mark his character. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, there is no doubt as to peculiarities: the que&s;tion is, whether a man's vices &s;hould be men|tioned; for in&s;tance, whether it &s;hould be mentioned that Addi&s;on and Parnel drank too freely: for people will probably more ea&s;ily indulge in drinking from knowing this; &s;o that more ill may be done by the example, than good by telling the whole truth."</Q> Here was an in&s;tance of his varying from him|&s;elf in talk; for when Lord Hailes and he &s;at one morning calmly conver&s;ing in my hou&s;e at Edinburgh, I well remember that Dr. John&s;on maintained, that <Q REND="inline">"if a man is to write <HI>A Panegyrick,</HI> he may keep vices out of &s;ight; but if he profe&s;&s;es to write <HI>A Life,</HI> he mu&s;t repre&s;ent it really as it was:"</Q> and when I objected to the danger of telling that Parnel drank to exce&s;s, he &s;aid, that <Q REND="inline">"it would produce an in&s;tructive caution to avoid drinking, when it was &s;een, that even the learning and genius of Parnel could be deba&s;ed by it."</Q> And
<PB N="145" REF="147" MS="y">
in the Hebrides he maintained, as appears from my <Q REND="inline">"Journal <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit. p. 240.</NOTE>,"</Q> that a man's  intimate friend &s;hould mention his faults, if he writes his life.</P>
<P>He had this evening, partly, I &s;uppo&s;e, from the &s;pirit of contradiction to his Whig friend, a violent argument with Dr. Taylor, as to the inclinations of the people of England at this time towards the Royal Family of Stuart. He grew &s;o outrageous as to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"that, if England were fairly polled, the pre&s;ent King would be &s;ent away to-night, and his adherents hanged to-morrow."</Q> Taylor, who was as violent a Whig as John&s;on was a Tory, was rou&s;ed by this to a pitch of bellowing. He denied, loudly, what John&s;on &s;aid; and maintained, that there was an abhorrence again&s;t the Stuart family, though he admitted that the people were not much attached to the pre&s;ent King <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Dr. Taylor was very ready to make this admi&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e the party with which he was connected was not in power. There was then &s;ome truth in it, owing to the pertinacity of factious clamour. Had he lived till now, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for him to deny that his Maje&s;ty po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the warme&s;t affection of his people.</NOTE>. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the &s;tate of the country is this: the people knowing it to be agreed on all hands that this King has not the hereditary right to the crown, and there being no hope that he who has it can be re&s;tored, have grown cold and indifferent upon the &s;ubject of loyalty, and have no warm attachment to any King. They would not, therefore, ri&s;k any thing to re&s;tore the exiled family. They would not give twenty &s;hillings a piece to bring it about. But, if a mere vote could do it, there would be twenty to one; at lea&s;t, there would be a very great majority of voices for it. For, Sir, you are to con&s;ider, that all tho&s;e who think a King has a right to his crown, as a man has to his e&s;tate, which is the ju&s;t opinion, would be for re&s;toring the King who certainly has the hereditary right, could he be tru&s;ted with it; in which there would be no danger now, when laws and every thing el&s;e are &s;o much advanced; and every King will govern by the laws. And you mu&s;t al&s;o con&s;ider, Sir, that there is nothing on the other &s;ide to oppo&s;e to this; for it is not alledged by any one that the pre&s;ent family has any inherent right: &s;o that the Whigs could not have a conte&s;t between two rights."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Taylor admitted, that if the que&s;tion as to hereditary right were to be tried by a poll of the people of England, to be &s;ure the ab&s;tract doctrine would be given in favour of the family of Stuart; but he &s;aid, the conduct of that family, which occa&s;ioned their expul&s;ion, was &s;o fre&s;h in the minds of the people, that they would not vote for a re&s;toration. Dr. John&s;on, I think,
<PB N="146" REF="148">
 was contented with the admi&s;&s;ion as to the hereditary right, leaving the original point in di&s;pute, <HI>viz.</HI> what the people upon the whole would do, taking in right and affection; for he &s;aid, people were afraid of a change, even when they thought it right. Dr. Taylor &s;aid &s;omething of the &s;light foundation of the here|ditary right of the hou&s;e of Stuart. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) the hou&s;e of Stuart &s;ucceeded to the full right of both the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter, who&s;e common &s;ource had the undi&s;puted right. A right to a throne is like a right to any thing el&s;e. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is &s;ufficient, where no better right can be &s;hewn. This was the ca&s;e with the Royal Family of England, as it is now with the King of France: for as to the fir&s;t beginning of the right, we are in the dark."</Q></P>
<P>Thur&s;day, September 18. La&s;t night Dr. John&s;on had propo&s;ed that the cry&s;tal lu&s;tre, or chandelier, in Dr. Taylor's large room, &s;hould be lighted up &s;ome time or other. Taylor &s;aid, it &s;hould be lighted up next night. <Q REND="inline">"That will do very well, (&s;aid I,) for it is Dr. John&s;on's birth-day."</Q> When we were in the I&s;le of Sky, John&s;on had de&s;ired me not to mention his birth|day. He did not &s;eem plea&s;ed at this time that I mentioned it, and &s;aid (&s;omewhat &s;ternly) <Q REND="inline">"he would <HI>not</HI> have the lu&s;tre lighted the next night."</Q></P>
<P>Some ladies, who had been pre&s;ent ye&s;terday when I mentioned his birth-day, came to dinner to-day, and plagued him unintentionally, by wi&s;hing him joy. I know not why he di&s;liked having his birth-day mentioned, unle&s;s it were that it reminded him of his approaching nearer to death, of which he had a con&s;tant dread.</P>
<P>I mentioned to him a friend of mine who was formerly gloomy from low &s;pirits, and much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the fear of death, but was now uniformly placid, and contemplated his di&s;&s;olution without any perturbation. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) this is only a di&s;ordered imagination taking a different turn."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of a collection being made of all the Engli&s;h Poets who had publi&s;hed a volume of poems. John&s;on told me, <Q REND="inline">"that a Mr. Coxeter, whom he knew, had gone the greate&s;t length towards this; having collected, I think, about five hundred volumes of poets who&s;e works were little known, but that upon his death Tom O&s;borne bought them, and they were di&s;|per&s;ed, which he thought a pity, as it was curious to &s;ee any &s;eries com|plete; and in every volume of poems &s;omething good may be found."</Q></P>
<P>He ob&s;erved, that a gentleman of eminence in literature had got into a bad &s;tyle of poetry of late. <Q REND="inline">"He puts (&s;aid he) a very common thing in a &s;trange dre&s;s till he does not know it him&s;elf, and thinks other people do not

<Q><L>'Hermit hoar, in &s;olemn cell,</L>

<P>"In &s;pring, 1779, when in better humour, he made the &s;econd &s;tanza, as in the text.

 I cannot help thinking the fir&s;t &s;tanza very good &s;olemn poetry, as al&s;o the three fir&s;t lines of the &s;econd.

<P>Friday, September 19, after breakfa&s;t, Dr. John&s;on and I &s;et out in Dr. Taylor's chai&s;e to go to Derby. The day was fine, and we re&s;olved to go by Keddle&s;tone, the &s;eat of Lord Scar&s;dale, that I might &s;ee his Lord|&s;hip's fine hou&s;e. I was &s;truck with the magnificence of the building; and the exten&s;ive park, with the fine&s;t verdure, covered with deer, and cattle, and &s;heep, delighted me. The number of old oaks, of an immen&s;e &s;ize, filled me with a &s;ort of re&s;pectful admiration: for one of them &s;ixty pounds was offered. The excellent &s;mooth gravel roads; the large piece of water formed by his Lord&s;hip from &s;ome &s;mall brooks, with a hand&s;ome barge upon it; the venerable Gothick church, now the family chapel, ju&s;t by the hou&s;e; in &s;hort, the grand groupe of objects agitated and di&s;tended my mind in a mo&s;t agreeable manner. <Q REND="inline">"One &s;hould think (&s;aid I) that the proprietor of all this <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be happy."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) all this excludes but one evil&mdash;poverty <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">When I mentioned Dr. John&s;on's remark to a lady of admirable good &s;en&s;e and quickne&s;s of under&s;tanding, &s;he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"It is true, all this excludes only one evil; but how much good does it let in?"</Q></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Our names were &s;ent up, and a well-dre&s;t elderly hou&s;ekeeper, a mo&s;t di&s;|tinct articulator, &s;hewed us the hou&s;e; which I need not de&s;cribe, as it is publi&s;hed in <Q REND="inline">"Adams's Works in Architecture."</Q> Dr. John&s;on thought better of it to-day than when he &s;aw it before; for the other night he attacked it violently, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"It would do excellently for a town hall. The large room with the pillars (&s;aid he) would do for the Judges to &s;it in at the a&s;&s;izes; the circular room for a jury chamber; and the rooms above for pri&s;oners."</Q> Still he thought the large room ill lighted, and of no u&s;e but for dancing in; and the bed-chambers but indifferent rooms; and that the immen&s;e &s;um which it co&s;t was injudiciou&s;ly laid out. Dr. Taylor had put him in mind of his <HI>appearing</HI> plea&s;ed with the hou&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"But (&s;aid he) that was when Lord Scar&s;dale was pre&s;ent. Politene&s;s obliges us to appear plea&s;ed with a man's works when he is pre&s;ent. No man will be &s;o ill bred as to que&s;tion you.

<P>Dr. Manningham, phy&s;ician in London, who was vi&s;iting at Lord Scar&s;dale's, accompanied us through many of the rooms, and &s;oon afterwards my Lord him&s;elf, to whom Dr. John&s;on was known, appeared, and did the honours of the hou&s;e. We talked of Mr. Langton. John&s;on, with a warm vehemence of affectionate regard, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"The earth does not bear a worthier man than Bennet Langton."</Q> We &s;aw a good many fine pictures, which I think are de&s;cribed in one of <Q REND="inline">"Young's Tours."</Q> There is a printed catalogue of them which the hou&s;ekeeper put into my hand; I &s;hould like to view them at lei&s;ure. I was much &s;truck with Daniel interpreting Nebuchad|nezzar's dream by Rembrandt. We were &s;hown a pretty large library. In his Lord&s;hip's dre&s;&s;ing-room lay John&s;on's &s;mall Dictionary: he &s;hewed it to me, with &s;ome eagerne&s;s, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Look'ye! <HI>Quae terra no&s;tri non plena laboris.</HI>"</Q> He ob&s;erved, al&s;o, Gold&s;mith's <Q REND="inline">"Animated Nature;"</Q> and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Here's our friend!

 When we arrived at Derby, Dr. Butter accompanied us to &s;ee the manu|factory of china there. I admired the ingenuity and delicate art with which a man fa&s;hioned clay into a cup, a &s;aucer, or a tea-pot, while a boy turned round a wheel to give the ma&s;s rotundity. I thought this as excellent in its &s;pecies of power, as making good ver&s;es in <HI>its</HI> &s;pecies. Yet I had no re&s;pect for this potter. Neither, indeed, has a man of any extent of thinking for a mere ver&s;e-maker, in who&s;e numbers, however perfect, there is no poetry, no mind. The china was beautiful; but Dr. John&s;on ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, it was too dear; for that he could have ve&s;&s;els of &s;ilver, of the &s;ame &s;ize, as cheap as what were here made of porcelain.</P>
<P>I felt a plea&s;ure in walking about Derby, &s;uch as I always have in walking about any town to which I am not accu&s;tomed. There is an immediate &s;en|&s;ation of novelty; and one &s;peculates on the way in which life is pa&s;&s;ed in it, which, although there is a &s;amene&s;s every where upon the whole, is yet minutely diver&s;ified. The minute diver&s;ities in every thing are wonderful. Talking of &s;having the other night at Dr. Taylor's, Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, of a thou&s;and &s;havers, two do not &s;have &s;o much alike as not to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed."</Q> I thought this not po&s;&s;ible, till he &s;pecified &s;o many of the varieties in &s;having;&mdash;holding the razor more or le&s;s perpendicular;&mdash;drawing long or &s;hort &s;trokes;&mdash;beginning at the upper part of the face, or the under;&mdash;at the right &s;ide or the left &s;ide. Indeed, when one con&s;iders what variety of &s;ounds can be uttered by the wind-pipe, in the compa&s;s of a very &s;mall aperture, we may be convinced how many degrees of difference there may be in the application of a razor.</P>
<P>We dined with Dr. Butter, who&s;e lady is daughter of my cou&s;in Sir John Douglas, who&s;e grand&s;on is now pre&s;umptive heir of the noble family of Queen&s;berry. John&s;on and he had a good deal of medical conver&s;ation. John&s;on &s;aid, he had &s;omewhere or other given an account of Dr. Nichols's di&s;cour&s;e <Q REND="inline">"De Anim&acirc; Medic&acirc;."</Q> He told us, <Q REND="inline">"that whatever a man's di&s;temper was, Dr. Nichols would not attend him as a phy&s;ician, if his mind was not at ea&s;e; for he believed that no medicines would have any influence. He once attended a man in trade, upon whom he found none of the medicines he pre&s;cribed had any effect; he a&s;ked the man's wife privately whether his affairs were not in a bad way? She &s;aid no. He continued his attendance &s;ome time, &s;till without &s;ucce&s;s. At length the man's wife told him, &s;he had di&s;covered that her hu&s;band's affairs <HI>were</HI> in a bad way.

<P>After dinner, Mrs. Butter went with me to &s;ee the &s;ilk-mill which Sir Thomas Lambe had a patent for, having brought away the contrivance from Italy. I am not very conver&s;ant with mechanicks; but the &s;implicity of this machine, and its multiplied operations, &s;truck me with an agreeable &s;urprize. I had learnt from Dr. John&s;on, during this interview, not to think with a dejected indifference of the works of art, and the plea&s;ures of life, becau&s;e life is uncertain and &s;hort; but to con&s;ider &s;uch indifference as a failure of rea&s;on, a morbidne&s;s of mind; for happine&s;s &s;hould be cultivated as much as we can, and the objects which are in&s;trumental to it &s;hould be &s;teadily con&s;idered as of importance, with a reference not only to our&s;elves, but to multitudes in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages. Though it is proper to value &s;mall parts, as
<Q><L>"Sands make the mountain, moments make the year <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Young.</NOTE>;"</L></Q>
yet we mu&s;t contemplate, collectively, to have a ju&s;t e&s;timation of objects. One moment's being unea&s;y or not, &s;eems of no con&s;equence; yet this may be thought of the next, and the next, and &s;o on, till there is a large portion of mi&s;ery. In the &s;ame way one mu&s;t think of happine&s;s, of learning, of friend&s;hip. We cannot tell the preci&s;e moment when friend&s;hip is formed. As in filling a ve&s;&s;el drop by drop there is at la&s;t a drop which makes it run over; &s;o in a &s;eries of kindne&s;&s;es there is at la&s;t one which makes the heart run over. We mu&s;t not divide objects of our attention into minute parts, and think &s;eparately of each part. It is by contemplating a large ma&s;s of human exi&s;tence, that a man, while he &s;ets a ju&s;t value on his own life, does not think of his death as annihilating all that is great and plea&s;ing in the world, as if actually <HI>contained in his mind,</HI> according to Berkeley's reverie. If his imagination be not &s;ickly and feeble, it <Q REND="inline">"wings its di&s;tant way"</Q> far beyond him&s;elf, and views the world in uncea&s;ing activity of every &s;ort. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, however, that Pope's plaintive reflection, that all things would be as gay as ever on the day of his death, is natural and common. We are apt to transfer to all around us our own gloom, without con&s;idering that at any given point of time there is, perhaps, as much youth and gaiety in the world as at another. Before I came into this life, in which I have had &s;o many plea&s;ant &s;cenes, have not thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands of deaths and
<PB N="152" REF="154" MS="y">
 funerals happened, and have not families been in grief for their neare&s;t relations? But have tho&s;e di&s;mal circum&s;tances at all affected <HI>me?</HI> Why then &s;hould the gloomy &s;cenes which I experience, or which I know, affect others? Let us guard again&s;t imagining that there is an end of felicity upon earth, when we our&s;elves grow old, or are unhappy.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on told us at tea, that when &s;ome of Dr. Dodd's pious friends were trying to con&s;ole him by &s;aying that he was going to leave <Q REND="inline">"a wretched world,"</Q> he had hone&s;ty enough not to join in the cant:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, no, (&s;aid he,) it has been a very agreeable world to me."</Q> John&s;on added, <Q REND="inline">"I re&s;pect Dodd for thus &s;peaking the truth; for, to be &s;ure, he had for &s;everal years enjoyed a life of great voluptuou&s;ne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>He told us, that Dodd's city friends &s;tood by him &s;o, that a thou&s;and pounds were ready to be given to the gaoler, if he would let him e&s;cape.&punc; He added, that he knew a friend of Dodd's, who walked about Newgate for &s;ome time on the evening before the day of his execution, with five hundred pounds in his pocket, ready to be paid to any of the turnkeys who could get him out: but it was too late; for he was watched with much circum&s;pection. He &s;aid, Dodd's friends had an image of him made of wax, which was to have been left in his place; and he believed it was carried into the pri&s;on.</P>
<P>John&s;on di&s;approved of Dr. Dodd's leaving the world per&s;uaded that <Q REND="inline">"The Convict's Addre&s;s to his unhappy Brethren,"</Q> was of his own writing. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, (&s;aid I,) you contributed to the deception; for when Mr. Seward expre&s;&s;ed a doubt to you that it was not Dodd's own, becau&s;e it had a great deal more force of mind in it than any thing known to be his, you an&s;wered,&mdash;'Why &s;hould you think &s;o? Depend upon it, Sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonder|fully."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, as Dodd got it from me to pa&s;s as his own, while that could do him any good, there was an <HI>implied promi&s;e</HI> that I &s;hould not own it. To own it, therefore, would have been telling a lie, with the addi|tion of breach of promi&s;e, which was wor&s;e than &s;imply telling a lie to make it be believed it was Dodd's. Be&s;ides, Sir, I did not <HI>directly</HI> tell a lie: I left the matter uncertain. Perhaps I thought that Seward would not believe it the le&s;s to be mine for what I &s;aid; but I would not put it in his power to &s;ay I had owned it."</Q></P>
<P>He prai&s;ed Blair's &s;ermons: <Q REND="inline">"Yet,"</Q> &s;aid he, (willing to let us &s;ee he was aware that fa&s;hionable fame, however de&s;erved, is not always the mo&s;t la&s;ting,) <Q REND="inline">"perhaps, they may not be re-printed after &s;even years; at lea&s;t not after Blair's death."</Q></P>

He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Gold&s;mith was a plant that flowered late. There appeared  nothing remarkable about him when he was young; though when he had got high in fame, one of his friends began to recollect &s;omething of his being di&s;tingui&s;hed at College. Gold&s;mith in the &s;ame manner recollected more of that friend's early years, as he grew a greater man."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned that Lord Monboddo told me, he awaked every morning at four, and then for his health got up and walked in his room naked, with the window open, which he called taking <HI>an air bath;</HI> after which he went to bed again, and &s;lept two hours more. John&s;on, who was always ready to beat down any thing that &s;eemed to be exhibited with di&s;proportionate importance, thus ob&s;erved: <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, there is no more in it than this, he awaltes at four, and cannot &s;leep till he chills him&s;elf, and makes the warmth of the bed a grateful &s;en&s;ation."</Q></P>
<P>I talked of the difficulty of ri&s;ing in the morning&punc; Dr. John&s;on&punc; told me&punc; <Q REND="inline">"that the learned Mrs. Carter, at that period when &s;he was eager in &s;tudy, did not awake as early as &s;he wi&s;hed, and &s;he therefore had a contrivance, that, at a certain hour, her chamber-light &s;hould burn a &s;tring to which a heavy weight was &s;u&s;pended, which then fell with a &s;trong &s;udden noi&s;e: this rou&s;ed her from &s;leep, and then &s;he had no difficulty in getting up."</Q> But I &s;aid that was my difficulty, and wi&s;hed there could be &s;ome medicine invented which would make one ri&s;e without pain, which I never did, unle&s;s after lying in bed a very long time. Perhaps there may be &s;omething in the &s;tores of Nature which can do this. I have thought of a pulley to rai&s;e me gradually&punc; but that would give me pain, as it would counteract my internal inclination. I would have &s;omething that can di&s;&s;ipate the <HI>vis inertiae,</HI> and give ela&s;ticity to the mu&s;cles. As I imagine that the human body may be put, by the opera|tion of other &s;ub&s;tances, into any &s;tate in which it has ever been; and as I have experienced a &s;tate in which ri&s;ing from bed was not di&s;agreeable but ea&s;y, nay, &s;ometimes agreeable; I &s;uppo&s;e that this &s;tate may be produced, if we knew by what. We can heat the body, we can cool it; we can give it ten&s;ion or relaxation; and &s;urely it is po&s;&s;ible to bring it into a &s;tate in which ri&s;ing from bed will not be a pain.</P>
<P>John&s;on ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"that a man &s;hould take a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;leep, which Dr. Mead &s;ays is between &s;even and nine hours."</Q> I told him, that Dr. Cullen &s;aid to me, that a man &s;hould not take more &s;leep than he can take at once. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"This rule, Sir, cannot hold in all ca&s;es; for many people have their &s;leep broken by &s;ickne&s;s; and &s;urely, Cullen would not have a man to get up, after having &s;lept but an hour. Such a regimen would &s;oon end in a

 <HI>long &s;leep</HI> <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This regimen was, however, practi&s;ed by Bi&s;hop Ken, of whom Hawkins (not Sir John) in his Life of that venerable Prelate, page 4, tells us, <Q REND="inline">"And that neither his &s;tudy might be the aggre&s;&s;or on his hours of in&s;truction, or what he judged his duty prevent his improvements; or both, his clo&s;et addre&s;&s;es to his GOD; he &s;trictly accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to but one &s;leep, which often obliged him to ri&s;e at one or two of the clock in the morning, and &s;ometimes &s;ooner; and grew &s;o habitual, that it continued with him almo&s;t till his la&s;t illne&s;s. And &s;o lively and chear|ful was his temper, that he would be very facetious and entertaining to his friends in the evening, even when it was perceived that with difficulty he kept his eyes open; and then &s;eemed to go to re&s;t with no other purpo&s;e than the refre&s;hing and enabling him with more vigour and cheerful|ne&s;s to &s;ing his morning hymn, as he then u&s;ed to do to his lute, before he put on his cloaths."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> Dr. Taylor remarked, I think very ju&s;tly, <Q REND="inline">"that a man who does not feel an inclination to &s;leep at the ordinary time, in&s;tead of being &s;tronger than other people, mu&s;t not be well; for a man in health has all the natural inclinations to eat, drink, and &s;leep, in a &s;trong degree."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on advi&s;ed me to-night not to <HI>refine</HI> in the education of my children. <Q REND="inline">"Life (&s;aid he) will not bear refinement: you mu&s;t do as other people do."</Q></P>
<P>As we drove back to A&s;hbourne, Dr. John&s;on recommended to me, as he had often done, to drink water only: <Q REND="inline">"For (&s;aid he) you are then &s;ure not to get drunk; whereas if you drink wine you are never &s;ure."</Q> I &s;aid, drinking wine was a plea&s;ure which I was unwilling to give up. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, (&s;aid he,) there is no doubt that not to drink wine is a great deduction from life; but it may be nece&s;&s;ary."</Q> He however owned, that in his opinion a free u&s;e of wine did not &s;horten life; and &s;aid, he would not give le&s;s for the life of a certain Scotch Lord (whom he named) celebrated for hard drinking, than for that of a &s;ober man. <Q REND="inline">"But &s;tay, (&s;aid he, with his u&s;ual intelligence, and accuracy of enquiry,) does it take much wine to make him drunk?"</Q> I an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"a great deal either of wine or &s;trong punch."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then (&s;aid he) that is the wor&s;e."</Q> I pre&s;ume to illu&s;trate my friend's ob&s;ervation thus: <Q REND="inline">"A fortre&s;s which &s;oon &s;urrenders has its walls le&s;s &s;hattered, than when a long and ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance is made."</Q></P>
<P>I ventured to mention a per&s;on who was as violent a Scot&s;man as he was an Engli&s;hman; and literally had the &s;ame contempt for an Engli&s;hman compared with a Scot&s;man, that he had for a Scot&s;man compared with an Engli&s;hman; and that he would &s;ay of Dr. John&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"Damned ra&s;cal! to talk as he does of the Scotch."</Q> This &s;eemed, for a moment, <Q REND="inline">"to give him pau&s;e."</Q> It, perhaps, pre&s;ented his extreme prejudice again&s;t the Scotch in a point of view &s;omewhat new to him, by the effect of <HI>contra&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>By the time when we returned to A&s;hbourne, Dr. Taylor was gone to bed. John&s;on and I &s;at up a long time by our&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="157" MS="y">
He was much diverted with an article which I &s;hewed him in the <Q REND="inline">"Critical  Review"</Q> of this year, giving an account of a curious publication, entitled, <Q REND="inline">"A Spiritual Diary and Soliloquies, by John Rutty, M. D."</Q> Dr. Rutty was one of the people called Quakers, a phy&s;ician of &s;ome eminence in Dublin, and authour of &s;everal works. This Diary, which was kept from 1753 to 1775, the year in which he died, and was now publi&s;hed in two volumes, octavo, exhibited, in the &s;implicity of his heart, a minute and hone&s;t regi&s;ter of the &s;tate of his mind; which, though frequently laughable enough, was not more &s;o than the hi&s;tory of many men would be, if recorded with equal fairne&s;s.</P>
<P>The following &s;pecimens were extracted by the Reviewers:</P>
<Q><P>Tenth month, 1753.</P>
<P>23. Indulgence in bed an hour too long.</P>
<P>Twelfth month, 17. An hypochondriack obnubilation from wind and indige&s;tion.</P>

<P>26. Cur&s;ed &s;nappi&s;hne&s;s to tho&s;e under me, on a bodily indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Third month, 11. On a provocation, exerci&s;ed a dumb re&s;entment for two days, in&s;tead of &s;colding.</P>
<P>22. Scolded too vehemently.</P>
<P>23. Dogged again.</P>
<P>Fourth month, 29. Mechanically and &s;infully dogged.</P></Q>
<P>John&s;on laughed heartily at this good Quieti&s;t's &s;elf-condemning minutes; particularly at his mentioning, with &s;uch a &s;erious regret, occa&s;ional in&s;tances of <Q REND="inline">"<HI>&s;wini&s;hne&s;s</HI> in eating, and <HI>doggedne&s;s of temper.</HI>"</Q> He thought the ob&s;ervations of the Critical Reviewers upon the importance of a man to him&s;elf &s;o ingenious and &s;o well expre&s;&s;ed, that I &s;hall here introduce them.</P>
<P>After ob&s;erving, that <Q REND="inline">"There are few writers who have gained any reputa|tion by recording their own actions,"</Q> they &s;ay,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We may reduce the egoti&s;ts to four cla&s;&s;es. In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> we have Julius Cae&s;ar: he relates his own tran&s;actions; but he relates them with peculiar grace and dignity, and his narrative is &s;upported by the greatne&s;s of his

<P>I mentioned to him that Dr. Hugh Blair, in his lectures on Rhetorick and Belles Lettres, which I heard him deliver at Edinburgh, had animadverted on the John&s;onian &s;tyle as too pompous; and attempted to imitate it, by giving a &s;entence of Addi&s;on in <Q REND="inline">"The Spectator,"</Q> No. 411, in the manner of John&s;on. When treating of the utility of the plea&s;ures of imagination in pre&s;erving us from vice, it is ob&s;erved of tho&s;e <Q REND="inline">"who know not how to be idle and innocent,"</Q> that their very fir&s;t &s;tep out of bu&s;ine&s;s is into vice or folly; which Dr. Blair &s;uppo&s;ed would have been expre&s;&s;ed in <Q REND="inline">"The Rambler,"</Q> thus: <Q REND="inline">"Their very fir&s;t &s;tep out of the regions of bu&s;ine&s;s is into the per|turbation of vice, or the vacuity of folly <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">When Dr. Blair publi&s;hed his <Q REND="inline">"Lectures,"</Q> he was invidiou&s;ly attacked for having omitted his cen&s;ure on John&s;on's &s;tyle, and, on the contrary, prai&s;ing it highly.

<P>I intend, before this work is concluded, to exhibit &s;pecimens of imitation of my friend's &s;tyle in various modes; &s;ome caricaturing or mimicking it, and &s;ome formed upon it, whether intentionally or with a degree of &s;imilarity to it, of which, perhaps, the writers were not con&s;cious.</P>
<P>In Baretti's Review, which he publi&s;hed in Italy, under the title of <Q REND="inline">"Fru&s;ta Letteraria,"</Q> it is ob&s;erved, that Dr. Robert&s;on the hi&s;torian had formed his &s;tyle upon that of <Q REND="inline">"Il celebre Samuele John&s;on."</Q> My friend him&s;elf was of that opinion; for he once &s;aid to me, in a plea&s;ant humour, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if Robert&s;on's

<P>I read to him a letter which Lord Monboddo had written to me, containing &s;ome critical remarks upon the &s;tyle of his <Q REND="inline">"Journey to the We&s;tern I&s;lands of Scotland."</Q> His Lord&s;hip prai&s;ed the very fine pa&s;&s;age upon landing at Icolmkill <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline">"WE were now treading that illu&s;trious i&s;land, which was once the luminary of the Caledonian regions, whence &s;avage clans and roving barbarians derived the benefits of knowledge, and the ble&s;&s;ings of religion.

'Illu&s;trious!'&mdash;for what? and then the &s;entence proceeds to expand the circum&s;tances connected with Iona.

<P>On Saturday, September 20, after breakfa&s;t, when Taylor was gone out to his farm, Dr. John&s;on and I had a &s;erious conver&s;ation by our&s;elves on melancholy and madne&s;s; which he was, I always thought, erroneou&s;ly inclined to confound together. Melancholy, like <Q REND="inline">"great wit,"</Q> may be <Q REND="inline">"near allied to madne&s;s;"</Q> but there is, in my opinion, a di&s;tinct &s;eparation between them. When he talked of madne&s;s, he was to be under&s;tood as &s;peaking of tho&s;e who were in any great degree di&s;turbed, or as it is com|monly expre&s;&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"troubled in mind."</Q> Some of the ancient philo&s;ophers held, that all deviations from right rea&s;on were madne&s;s; and whoever wi&s;hes to &s;ee the opinions both of ancients and moderns upon this &s;ubject, collected and illu&s;trated with a variety of curious facts, may read Dr. Arnold's very entertaining work <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Ob&s;ervations on In&s;anity,"</Q> by Thomas Arnold, M.

<P>John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"A madman loves to be with people whom he fears; not as a dog fears the la&s;h; but of whom he &s;tands in awe."</Q> I was &s;truck with the ju&s;tice of this ob&s;ervation.

<P>He added, <Q REND="inline">"Madmen are all &s;en&s;ual in the lower &s;tages of the di&s;temper.

Mr. Seward has furni&s;hed me with a remarkable anecdote in confirmation of Dr. John&s;on's ob&s;ervation. A trade&s;man, who had acquired a large fortune in London, retired from bu&s;ine&s;s, and went to live at Worce&s;ter. His mind, being without its u&s;ual occupation, and having nothing el&s;e to &s;upply its place, preyed upon it&s;elf, &s;o that exi&s;tence was a torment to him. At la&s;t he was &s;eized with the &s;tone; and a friend who found him in one of its &s;evere&s;t fits, having expre&s;&s;ed his concern, <Q REND="inline">"No, no, Sir, (&s;aid he,) don't pity me: what I now feel is ea&s;e, compared with that torture of mind from which it relieves me."</Q></NOTE>. Employment, Sir, and
<PB N="159" REF="161" MS="y">
hard&s;hips, prevent melancholy. I &s;uppo&s;e in all our army in America there  was not one man who went mad."</Q></P>
<P>We entered &s;eriou&s;ly upon a que&s;tion of much importance to me, which John&s;on was plea&s;ed to con&s;ider with friendly attention. I had long com|plained to him that I felt my&s;elf di&s;contented in Scotland, as too narrow a &s;phere, and that I wi&s;hed to make my chief re&s;idence in London, the great &s;cene of ambition, in&s;truction, and amu&s;ement; a &s;cene, which was to me, comparatively &s;peaking, a heaven upon earth. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I never knew any one who had &s;uch a <HI>gu&s;t</HI> for London as you have; and I can|not blame you for your wi&s;h to live there: yet, Sir, were I in your father's place, I &s;hould not con&s;ent to your &s;ettling there; for I have the old &s;eudal notions, and I &s;hould be afraid that Auchinleck would be de&s;erted, as you would &s;oon find it more de&s;irable to have a country-&s;eat in a better climate. I own, however, that to con&s;ider it as a <HI>duty</HI> to re&s;ide on a family e&s;tate is a prejudice; for we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that working-people get employment equally, and the produce of land is &s;old equally, whether a great family re&s;ides at home or not; and if the rents of an e&s;tate be carried to London, they return again in the circulation of commerce; nay, Sir, we mu&s;t perhaps allow, that carrying the rents to a di&s;tance is a good, becau&s;e it contributes to that circu|lation. We mu&s;t, however, allow, that a well-regulated great family may improve a neighbourhood in civility and elegance, and give an example of good order, virtue, and piety; and &s;o its re&s;idence at home may be of much advantage. But if a great family be di&s;orderly and vicious, its re&s;idence at home is very pernicious to a neighbourhood. There is not now the &s;ame inducement to live in the country as formerly; the plea&s;ures of &s;ocial life are much better enjoyed in town; and there is no longer in the country that power and influence in proprietors of land which they had in old times, and which made the country &s;o agreeable to them. The Laird of Auchinleck now is not near &s;o great a man as the Laird of Auchinleck was a hundred years ago."</Q></P>
<P>I told him, that one of my ance&s;tors never went from home without being attended by thirty men on hor&s;eback. John&s;on's &s;hrewdne&s;s and &s;pirit of enquiry were exerted upon every occa&s;ion. <Q REND="inline">"Pray (&s;aid he,) how did your ance&s;tor &s;upport his thirty men and thirty hor&s;es, when he went at a di&s;tance
<PB REF="162" MS="y">
 from home, in an age when there was hardly any money in circulation?"</Q> I &s;ugge&s;ted the &s;ame difficulty to a friend, who mentioned Douglas's going to the Holy Land with a numerous train of followers. <Q REND="inline">"Douglas could, no doubt, maintain followers enough while living upon his own lands, the pro|duce of which &s;upplied them with food; but he could not carry that food to the Holy Land; and as there was no commerce by which he could be &s;upplied with money, how could he maintain them in foreign countries?"</Q></P>
<P>I &s;ugge&s;ted a doubt, that if I were to re&s;ide in London, the exqui&s;ite ze&s;t with which I reli&s;hed it in occa&s;ional vi&s;its might go off, and I might grow tired of it. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, you find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford."</Q></P>
<P>To obviate his apprehen&s;ion, that by &s;ettling in London I might de&s;ert the &s;eat of my ance&s;tors, I a&s;&s;ured him, that I had old feudal principles to a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m; and that I felt all the <HI>dulcedo</HI> of the <HI>natale &s;olum.</HI> I reminded him, that the Laird of Auchinleck had an elegant hou&s;e, in front of which he could ride ten miles forward upon his own territories, upon which he had upwards of &s;ix hundred people attached to him; that the family &s;eat was rich in natural, romantick beauties of rock, wood, and water; and that in my <Q REND="inline">"morn of life"</Q> I had appropriated the fine&s;t de&s;criptions, in the ancient Cla&s;&s;icks to certain &s;cenes there, which were thus a&s;&s;ociated in my mind. That when all this was con&s;idered, I &s;hould certainly pa&s;s a part of the year at home, and enjoy it the more from variety, and from bringing with me a &s;hare of the intellectual &s;tores of the metropolis. He li&s;tened to all this, and kindly <Q REND="inline">"hoped it might be as I now &s;uppo&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"A country gentleman &s;hould bring his lady to vi&s;it London as &s;oon as he can, that they may have agreeable topicks for conver&s;ation when they are by them&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P>As I meditated trying my fortune in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall, our conver&s;ation turned upon the profe&s;&s;ion of the law in England. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t not indulge too &s;anguine hopes, &s;hould you be called to our bar. I was told, by a very &s;en&s;ible lawyer, that there are a great many chances again&s;t any man's &s;ucce&s;s in the profe&s;&s;ion of the law; the candidates are &s;o numerous, and tho&s;e who get large practice &s;o few. He &s;aid, it was by no means true that a man of good parts and application is &s;ure of having bu&s;ine&s;s, though, he, indeed, allowed that if &s;uch a man could but appear in a few cau&s;es, his merit would be known, and he would get forward; but that the great ri&s;k
<PB N="161" REF="163" MS="y">
was, that a man might pa&s;s half a life-time in the Courts, and never have an  opportunity of &s;hewing his abilities."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of employment being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the mind from wearying and growing fretful, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e who have a tendency to melancholy; and I mentioned to him a &s;aying which &s;omebody had related of an American &s;avage, who when an European was expatiating on all the advantages of money, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> this que&s;tion: <Q REND="inline">"Will it purcha&s;e <HI>occupation?</HI>"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Depend upon it, Sir, this &s;aying is too refined for a &s;avage. And, Sir, money <HI>will</HI> purcha&s;e occupation; it will purcha&s;e all the conve|niencies of life; it will purcha&s;e variety of company; it will purcha&s;e all &s;orts of entertainment."</Q></P>
<P>I talked to him of For&s;ter's <Q REND="inline">"Voyage to the South Seas,"</Q> which plea&s;ed me; but I found he did not like it. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) there is a great affec|tation of fine writing in it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But he carries you along with him."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; he does not carry <HI>me</HI> along with him: he leaves me behind him: or rather, indeed, he &s;ets me before him; for he makes me turn over many leaves at a time."</Q></P>
<P>On Sunday, September 12, we went to the church of A&s;hbourne, which is one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t luminous that I have &s;een in any town of the &s;ame &s;ize. I felt great &s;atisfaction in con&s;idering that I was &s;upported in my fondne&s;s of &s;olemn publick wor&s;hip by the general concurrence and munifi|cence of mankind.</P>
<P>John&s;on and Taylor were &s;o different from each other, that I wondered at their pre&s;erving &s;uch an intimacy. Their having been at &s;chool and college together, might, in &s;ome degree, account for this; but Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds has furni&s;hed me with a &s;tronger rea&s;on; for John&s;on mentioned to him, that he had been told by Taylor he was to be his heir. I &s;hall not take upon me to animadvert upon this; but certain it is, that John&s;on paid great attention to Taylor. He now, however, &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I love him, but I do not love him more; my regard for him does not increa&s;e. As it is &s;aid in the Apocrypha, 'his talk is of bullocks <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus, chap. xxxviii. v. 25. The whole chapter may be read as an admirable illu&s;tration of the &s;uperiority of cultivated minds over the gro&s;s and illiterate.</NOTE>:' I do not &s;uppo&s;e he is very fond of my company. His habits are by no means &s;ufficiently clerical: this he knows that I &s;ee; and no man likes to live under the eye of perpetual di&s;approbation."</Q></P>
<P>I have no doubt that a good many &s;ermons were compo&s;ed for Taylor by John&s;on. At this time I found, upon his table, a part of one which he had
<PB N="162" REF="164" MS="y">
 newly begun to write; and <HI>Concio pro Tayloro</HI> appears in one of his diaries. When to the&s;e circum&s;tances we add the internal evidence from the power of thinking and &s;tyle, in the collection which the Reverend Mr. Hayes has publi&s;hed, with the <HI>&s;ignificant</HI> title of <Q REND="inline">"Sermons <HI>left for publication</HI> by the Reverend John Taylor, LL. D."</Q> our conviction will be complete.</P>
<P>I, however, would not have it thought, that Dr Taylor, though he could not write like John&s;on, (as, indeed, who could?<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">d not &s;ometimes compo&s;e &s;ermons as good as tho&s;e which we generally have from very re&s;pectable divines. He &s;hewed me one with notes on the margin in John&s;on's hand|writing; and I was pre&s;ent when he read another to John&s;on, that he might have his opinion of it, and John&s;on &s;aid it was <Q REND="inline">"very well."</Q> The&s;e, we may be &s;ure, were not John&s;on's; for he was above little arts, or tricks of deception.</P>
<P>John&s;on was by no means of opinion, that every man of a learned profe&s;&s;ion &s;hould con&s;ider it as incumbent upon him, or as nece&s;&s;ary to his credit, to appear as an authour. When in the ardour of ambition for literary fame, I regretted to him one day that an eminent Judge had nothing of it, and therefore would leave no perpetual monument of him&s;elf to po&s;terity. <Q REND="inline">"Alas, Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) what a ma&s;s of confu&s;ion &s;hould we have if every Bi&s;hop and every Judge, every Lawyer, Phy&s;ician, and Divine, were to write books."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned to John&s;on a re&s;pectable per&s;on of a very &s;trong mind, who had little of that tenderne&s;s which is common to human nature; as an in&s;tance of which, when I &s;ugge&s;ted to him that he &s;hould invite his &s;on, who had been &s;ettled ten years in foreign parts, to come home and pay him a vi&s;it, his an&s;wer was, <Q REND="inline">"No, no, let him mind his bu&s;ine&s;s."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I do not agree with him, Sir, in this. Getting money is not all a man's bu&s;ine&s;s: to culti|vate kindne&s;s is a valuable part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of life."</Q></P>
<P>In the evening, John&s;on being in very good &s;pirits, entertained us with &s;everal characteri&s;tical portraits. I regret that any of them e&s;caped my retention and diligence. I found, from experience, that to collect my friend's conver&s;ation &s;o as to exhibit it with any degree of its original flavour, it was nece&s;&s;ary to write it down without delay. To record his &s;ayings, after &s;ome di&s;tance of time, was like pre&s;erving or pickling long-kept and faded fruits or other vegetables, which, when in that &s;tate, have little or nothing of their ta&s;te when fre&s;h.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pre&s;ent my readers with a &s;eries of what I gathered this evening from the John&s;onian garden.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="165" MS="y">
<Q>"My friend, the late Earl of Corke, had a great de&s;ire to maintain the  literary character of his family: he was a genteel man, but did not keep up the dignity of his rank. He was &s;o generally civil, that nobody thanked him for it."</Q></P>
<P><Q>"Did we not hear &s;o much &s;aid of Jack Wilkes, we &s;hould think more highly of his conver&s;ation. Jack has great variety of talk, Jack is a &s;cholar, and Jack has the manners of a gentleman. But after hearing his name &s;ounded from pole to pole, as the phoenix of convivial felicity, we are di&s;appointed in his company. He has always been <HI>at me:</HI> but I would do Jack a kindne&s;s, rather than not. The conte&s;t is now over."</Q></P>
<P><Q>"Garrick's gaiety of conver&s;ation has delicacy and elegance: Foote makes you laugh more; but Foote has the air of a buffoon paid for entertaining the company. He, indeed, well de&s;erves his hire."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Colley Cibber once con&s;ulted me as to one of his birth-day Odes, a long time before it was wanted. I objected very freely to &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages. Cibber lo&s;t patience, and would not read his Ode to an end. When we had done with critici&s;m, we walked over to Richard&s;on's, the authour of 'Clari&s;&s;a,' and I wondered to find Richard&s;on di&s;plea&s;ed that I 'did not treat Cibber with more <HI>re&s;pect.'</HI> Now, Sir, to talk of <HI>re&s;pect</HI> for a <HI>player!</HI>"</Q> (&s;miling di&s;dainfully). BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"There, Sir, you are always heretical: you never will allow merit to a player."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Merit, Sir! what merit? Do you re&s;pect a rope-dancer, or a ballad-&s;inger&punc;"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir: but we re&s;pect a great player, as a man who can conceive lofty &s;entiments, and can expre&s;s them gracefully."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"What, Sir, a fellow who claps a hump on his back, and a lump on his leg, and cries, <HI>'I am Richard the Third?'</HI> Nay, Sir, a ballad-&s;inger is a higher man, for he does two things; he repeats and he &s;ings: there is both recitation and mu&s;ick in his performance: the player only recites."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir! you may turn any thing into ridicule. I allow, that a player of farce is not entitled to re&s;pect; he does a little thing: but he who can repre&s;ent exalted characters, and touch the noble&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, has very re&s;pectable powers: and mankind have agreed in admiring great talents for the &s;tage. We mu&s;t con&s;ider, too, that a great player does what very few are capable to do: his art is a very rare faculty. <HI>Who</HI> can repeat Hamlet's Soliloquy, 'To be, or not to be,' as Garrick does it?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Any body may. Jemmy, there (a boy about eight years old, who was in the room) will do it as well in a week."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"No, no, Sir: and as a proof of the merit of great acting, and of the value which mankind &s;et upon it, Garrick has got a hundred thou&s;and pounds."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Is getting a hundred thou&s;and pounds a proof of excellence? That has been done by a &s;coundrel commi&s;&s;ary."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166" MS="y">
 This was mo&s;t fallacious rea&s;oning. I was <HI>&s;ure,</HI> for once, that I had the be&s;t &s;ide of the argument.

<P>On Monday, September 22, when at breakfa&s;t, I unguardedly &s;aid to Dr. John&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h I &s;aw you and Mrs. Macaulay together."</Q> He grew very angry; and, after a pau&s;e, while a cloud gathered on his brow, he bur&s;t out, <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; you would not &s;ee us quarrel, to make you &s;port. Don't you know that it is very uncivil to <HI>pit</HI> two people again&s;t one another?"</Q> Then, checking him&s;elf, and wi&s;hing to be more gentle, he added, <Q REND="inline">"I do not &s;ay you &s;hould be hanged or drowned for this; but it <HI>is</HI> very uncivil."</Q> Dr. Taylor thought him in the wrong, and &s;poke to him privately of it; but I afterwards acknowledged to John&s;on that I was to blame, for I candidly owned, that I meant to expre&s;s a de&s;ire to &s;ee a conte&s;t between Mrs. Macaulay and him; but then I knew how the conte&s;t would end; &s;o that I was to &s;ee him triumph. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you cannot be &s;ure how a conte&s;t will end; and no man has a right to engage two people in a di&s;pute by which their pa&s;&s;ions may be inflamed, and they may part with bitter re&s;entment again&s;t each other. I would &s;ooner keep company with a man from whom I mu&s;t guard my pockets, than with a man who contrives to bring me into a di&s;pute with &s;omebody that he may hear it. This is the great fault of&mdash;, (naming one of our friends) endeavouring to introduce a &s;ubject upon which he knows two people in the company differ."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But he told me, Sir, he does it for in&s;truction."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Whatever the motive be, Sir, the man who does &s;o, does very wrong.

<P>He found great fault with a gentleman of our acquaintance for keeping a bad table. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) when a man is invited to dinner, he is di&s;ap|pointed if he does not get &s;omething good. I advi&s;ed Mrs. Thrale, who has no card-parties at her hou&s;e, to give &s;weet-meats, and &s;uch good things, in an evening, as are not commonly given, and &s;he would find company enough come to her; for every body loves to have things which plea&s;e the palate put in their way, without trouble or preparation."</Q> Such was his attention to the <HI>minutiae</HI> of life and manners.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="167" MS="y">

<P>Mr. Burke's <Q REND="inline">"Letter to the Sheriffs of Bri&s;tol, on the affairs of America,"</Q> being mentioned, John&s;on cen&s;ured the compo&s;ition much, and he ridiculed the definition of a free government, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"For any practical purpo&s;e, it is what the people think &s;o <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Edit. 2, p. 53.</NOTE>."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I will let the King of France govern me on tho&s;e conditions, (&s;aid he,) for it is to be governed ju&s;t as I plea&s;e."</Q> And when Dr. Taylor talked of a girl being &s;ent to a pari&s;h workhou&s;e, and a&s;ked how much &s;he could be obliged to work. <Q REND="inline">"Why, (&s;aid John&s;on,) as much as is rea&s;onable: and what is that? as much as <HI>&s;he thinks</HI> rea&s;onable."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on obligingly propo&s;ed to carry me to &s;ee I&s;lam, a romantick &s;cene, now belonging to a family of the name of Port, but formerly the &s;eat of the Congreves. I &s;uppo&s;e it is well de&s;cribed in &s;ome of the Tours. John&s;on de&s;cribed it di&s;tinctly and vividly, at which I could not but expre&s;s to him my wonder; becau&s;e, though my eyes, as he ob&s;erved, were better than his, I could not by any means equal him in repre&s;enting vi&s;ible objects. I &s;aid, the difference between us in this re&s;pect was as that between a man who has a bad in&s;trument, but plays well on it, and a man who has a good in&s;trument, on which he can play very imperfectly.</P>
<P>I recollect a very fine amphitheatre, &s;urrounded with hills covered with wood, and walks neatly formed along the &s;ide of a rocky &s;teep, on the quarter next the hou&s;e, with rece&s;&s;es under projections of rock, over|&s;hadowed with trees; in one of which rece&s;&s;es, we were told, Congreve wrote his <Q REND="inline">"Old Bachelor."</Q> We viewed a remarkable natural curio&s;ity at I&s;lam; two rivers bur&s;ting near each other from the rock, not from immediate &s;prings, but after having run for many miles under ground. Plott, in his <Q REND="inline">"Hi&s;tory of Stafford&s;hire <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Page 89.</NOTE>"</Q>, gives an account of this curio&s;ity; but John&s;on would not believe it, though we had the atte&s;tation of the gardener, who &s;aid, he had put in corks, where the river <HI>Manyfold</HI> &s;inks into the ground, and had eatched them in a net, placed before one of the openings where the water

<P>Talking of Dr. John&s;on's unwillingne&s;s to believe extraordinary things, I ventured to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you come near Hume's argument again&s;t miracles, 'That it is more probable witne&s;&s;es &s;hould lie, or be mi&s;taken, than that they &s;hould happen."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, Hume, taking the propo&s;ition &s;imply, is right. But the Chri&s;tian revelation is not proved by the miracles alone, but as connected with prophecies, and with the doctrines in confirma|tion of which the miracles were wrought."</Q></P>
<P>He repeated his ob&s;ervation, that the difference among Chri&s;tians are really of no con&s;equence. <Q REND="inline">"For in&s;tance, (&s;aid he,) if a Prote&s;tant objects to a Papi&s;t, 'You wor&s;hip images;' the Papi&s;t can an&s;wer, 'I do not in&s;i&s;t on <HI>your</HI> doing it; you may be a very good Papi&s;t without it: I do it only as a help to my devotion."</Q> I &s;aid, the great article of Chri&s;tianity is the revelation of immortality. John&s;on admitted it was.</P>
<P>In the evening, a gentleman-farmer, who was on a vi&s;it at Dr. Taylor's, attempted to di&s;pute with John&s;on in favour of Mungo Campbell, who &s;hot Alexander, Earl of Eglintoune, upon his having fallen, when retreating from his Lord&s;hip, who he believed was about to &s;eize his gun, as he had threatened to do. He &s;aid, he &s;hould have done ju&s;t as Campbell did. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Whoever would do as Campbell did, de&s;erves to be hanged; not that I could, as a juryman, have found him legally guilty of murder; but I am glad they found means to convict him."</Q> The gentleman-farmer &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"A poor man has as much honour as a rich man; and Campbell had <HI>that</HI> to defend."</Q> John&s;on exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"A poor man has no honour."</Q> The Engli&s;h yeoman, not di&s;mayed, proceeded: <Q REND="inline">"Lord Eglintoune was a damned fool to run on upon Campbell, after being warned that Campbell would &s;hoot him if he did."</Q> John&s;on, who could not bear any thing like &s;wearing, angrily replied, <Q REND="inline">"He was <HI>not a damned</HI> fool: he only thought too well of Campbell. He did not believe Campbell would be &s;uch a <HI>damned</HI> &s;coundrel, as to do &s;o <HI>damned</HI> a thing."</Q> His empha&s;is on <HI>damned,</HI> accompanied with frowning looks, reproved his opponent's want of decorum in <HI>his</HI> pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Talking of the danger of being mortified by rejection, when making approaches to the acquaintance of the great, I ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"I am, however, generally for trying, 'Nothing venture, nothing have."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Very true, Sir; but I have always been more afraid of failing, than hopeful of
<PB N="167" REF="169" MS="y">
&s;ucce&s;s."</Q> And, indeed, though he had all ju&s;t re&s;pect for rank, no man  ever le&s;s courted the favour of the great.</P>
<P>During this interview at A&s;hbourne, John&s;on &s;eemed to be more uniformly &s;ocial, cheerful, and alert, than I had almo&s;t ever &s;een him. He was prompt on great occa&s;ions and on &s;mall. Taylor, who prai&s;ed every thing of his own to exce&s;s, in &s;hort, <Q REND="inline">"who&s;e gee&s;e were all &s;wans,"</Q> as the proverb &s;ays, expatiated on the excellence of his bull-dog, which he told us was <Q REND="inline">"perfectly well &s;haped."</Q> John&s;on, after examining the animal attentively, thus repre&s;&s;ed the vain-glory of our ho&s;t:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, he is <HI>not</HI> well &s;haped; for there is not the quick tran&s;ition from the thickne&s;s of the fore-part to the <HI>tenuity</HI>&mdash;the thin part&mdash;behind, which a bull-dog ought to have."</Q> This <HI>tenuity,</HI> was the only <HI>hard word</HI> that I heard him u&s;e during this interview, and it will be ob&s;erved, he in&s;tantly put another expre&s;&s;ion in its place. Taylor &s;aid, a &s;mall bull-dog was as good as a large one. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; for, in proportion to his &s;ize, he has &s;trength: and your argument would prove, that a good bull-dog may be as &s;mall as a mou&s;e."</Q> It was amazing how he entered with per&s;picuity and keenne&s;s upon every thing that occurred in conver&s;ation. Mo&s;t men, whom I know, would no more think of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing a que&s;tion about a bull-dog, than of attacking a bull.</P>
<P>I cannot allow any fragment whatever that floats in my memory concerning the great &s;ubject of this work to be lo&s;t. Though a &s;mall particular may appear trifling to &s;ome, it will be reli&s;hed by others; while every little &s;park adds &s;omething to the general blaze: and to plea&s;e the true, candid, warm admirers of John&s;on, and in any degree increa&s;e the &s;plendour of his reputa|tion, I bid defiance to the &s;hafts of ridicule, or even of malignity. Showers of them have been di&s;charged at my <Q REND="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides;"</Q> yet it &s;till &s;ails unhurt along the &s;tream of time, and, as an attendant upon John&s;on,
<Q><L>"Pur&s;ues the triumph, and partakes the gale."</L></Q></P>
<P>One morning after breakfa&s;t, when the &s;un &s;hone bright, we walked out together, and <Q REND="inline">"pored"</Q> for &s;ome time with placid indolence upon an artificial water-fall, which Dr. Taylor had made by building a &s;trong dyke of &s;tone acro&s;s the river behind his garden. It was now &s;omewhat ob&s;tructed by branches of trees and other rubbi&s;h, which had come down the river and &s;ettled clo&s;e to it. John&s;on, partly from a de&s;ire to &s;ee it play more freely, and partly from that inclination to activity which will animate, at times, the mo&s;t inert and &s;luggi&s;h mortal, took a long pole which was lying on the bank, and pu&s;hed down &s;everal parcels of this wreck with painful a&s;&s;iduity, while I &s;tood quietly by, wondering to behold the &s;age thus curiou&s;ly employed, and &s;miling with an
<PB N="168" REF="170" MS="y">
 humorous &s;atisfaction each time when he carried his point. He worked till he was quite out of breath; and having found a large dead cat &s;o heavy that he could not move it after &s;everal efforts, <Q REND="inline">"Come, (&s;aid he, throwing down the pole,) <HI>you</HI> &s;hall take it now;"</Q> which I accordingly did, and being a fre&s;h man, &s;oon made the cat tumble over the ca&s;cade. This may be laughed at as too trifling to record; but it is a &s;mall characteri&s;tick trait in the Flemi&s;h picture which I give of my friend, and in which, therefore, I mark the mo&s;t minute particulars. And let it be remembered, that <Q REND="inline">"Ae&s;op at play"</Q> is one of the in&s;tructive apologues of antiquity.</P>
<P>I mentioned an old gentleman of our acquaintance who&s;e memory was beginning to fail.&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"There mu&s;t be a di&s;ea&s;ed mind, where there is a failure of memory at &s;eventy. A man's head, Sir, mu&s;t be morbid if he fails &s;o &s;oon."</Q> My friend, being now him&s;elf &s;ixty-eight, might think thus: but I imagine, that <HI>three&s;core and ten,</HI> the P&s;almi&s;t's period of &s;ound human life, in later ages may have a failure, though there be no di&s;ea&s;e in the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Talking of Roche&s;ter's Poems, he &s;aid, he had given them to Mr. Steevens to ca&s;trate for the edition of the Poets, to which he was to write Prefaces. Dr. Taylor (the only time I ever heard him &s;ay any thing witty <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">I am told, that the Honourable Horace Walpole has a collection of <HI>Bon Mots</HI> by per&s;ons who never &s;aid but one.</NOTE>) ob|&s;erved, that <Q REND="inline">"if Roche&s;ter had been ca&s;trated him&s;elf, his exceptionable poems would not have been written."</Q> I a&s;ked if Burnet had not given a good Life of Roche&s;ter. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"We have a good <HI>Death:</HI> there is not much <HI>Life.</HI>"</Q> I a&s;ked whether Prior's Poems were to be printed entire: John&s;on &s;aid they were. I mentioned Lord Hailes's cen&s;ure of Prior, in his Preface to a collection of <Q REND="inline">"Sacred Poems,"</Q> by various hands, publi&s;hed by him at Edinburgh a great many years ago, where he mentions, <Q REND="inline">"tho&s;e impure tales which will be the eternal opprobrium of their ingenious authour."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, Lord Hailes has forgot. There is nothing in Prior that will excite to lewdne&s;s. If Lord Hailes thinks there is, he mu&s;t be more combu&s;tible than other people."</Q> I in&s;tanced the tale of <Q REND="inline">"Paulo Purgant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> and his Wife."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, there is nothing there, but that his wife wanted to be ki&s;&s;ed, when poor Paulo was out of pocket. No, Sir, Prior is a lady's book. No lady is a&s;hamed to have it &s;tanding in her library."</Q></P>
<P>The hypochondriack di&s;order being mentioned, Dr. John&s;on did not think it &s;o common as I &s;uppo&s;ed.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Dr. Taylor (&s;aid he) is the &s;ame one day as another. Burke and Reynolds are the &s;ame. Beauclerk, except when in pain, is the &s;ame. I am not &s;o my&s;elf; but this I do not mention commonly."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="171" MS="y">
I complained of a wretched changefulne&s;s, &s;o that I could not pre&s;erve, for  any long continuance, the &s;ame views of any thing. It was mo&s;t comfortable to me to experience, in Dr. John&s;on's company, a relief from this unea&s;ine&s;s. His &s;teady vigorous mind held firm before me tho&s;e objects which my own feeble and tremulous imagination frequently pre&s;ented, in &s;uch a wavering &s;tate, that my rea&s;on could not judge well of them.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on advi&s;ed me to-day, to have as many books about me as I could; that I might read upon any &s;ubject upon which I had a de&s;ire for in&s;truction at the time. <Q REND="inline">"What you read <HI>then</HI> (&s;aid he) you will remember; but if you have not a book immediately ready, and the &s;ubject moulds in your mind, it is a chance if you again have a de&s;ire to &s;tudy it."</Q> He added, <Q REND="inline">"If a man never has an eager de&s;ire for in&s;truction, he &s;hould pre&s;cribe a ta&s;k for him&s;elf. But it is better when a man reads from im|mediate inclination."</Q></P>
<P>He repeated a good many lines of Horace's Odes, while we were in the chai&s;e. I remember particularly the Ode <Q REND="inline">"Eheu fugaces."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, the di&s;pute as to the comparative excellence of Homer or Virgil<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">I am informed by Mr. Langton, that a great many years ago he was pre&s;ent when this que&s;tion was agitated between Dr. John&s;on and Mr. Burke; and, to u&s;e John&s;on's phra&s;e, they <Q REND="inline">"talked their be&s;t;"</Q> John&s;on for Homer, Burke for Virgil. It may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been one of the able&s;t and mo&s;t brilliant conte&s;ts that ever was exhibited. How much mu&s;t we regret that it has not been pre&s;erved.</NOTE> was inaccurate. <Q REND="inline">"We mu&s;t con&s;ider (&s;aid he) whether Homer was not the greate&s;t poet, though Virgil may have produced the fine&s;t poem. Virgil was indebted to Homer for the whole invention of the &s;tructure of an epick poem, and for many of his beauties."</Q></P>
<P>He told me, that Bacon was a favourite authour with him; but he had never read his works till he was compiling the Engli&s;h Dictionary, in which, he &s;aid, I might &s;ee Bacon very often quoted. Mr. Seward recollects his having mentioned, that a Dictionary of the Engli&s;h language might be compiled from Bacon's writings alone, and that he had once an intention of giving an edition of Bacon, at lea&s;t of his Engli&s;h works, and writing the Life of that great man. Had he executed this intention, there can be no doubt that he would have done it in a mo&s;t ma&s;terly manner. Mallet's Life of Bacon has no incon&s;iderable merit as an acute and elegant di&s;&s;ertation relative to its &s;ub|ject; but Mallet's mind was not comprehen&s;ive enough to embrace the va&s;t extent of Lord Verulam's genius and re&s;earch. Dr. Warburton therefore
<PB N="170" REF="172" MS="y">
 ob&s;erved, with witty ju&s;tne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"that Mallet in his Life of Bacon had forgotten that he was a philo&s;opher; and if he &s;hould write the Life of the Duke of Marlborough, which he had undertaken to do, he would probably forget that he was a General."</Q></P>
<P>Wi&s;hing to be &s;atisfied what degree of truth there was in a &s;tory which a friend of John&s;on's and mine had told me to his di&s;advantage, I mentioned it to him in direct terms; and it was to this effect: that a gentleman who had lived in great intimacy with him, &s;hewn him much kindne&s;s, and even relieved him from a &s;punging-hou&s;e, having afterwards fallen into bad circum|&s;tances, was one day, when John&s;on was at dinner with him, &s;eized for debt, and carried to pri&s;on; that John&s;on &s;at &s;till undi&s;turbed, and went on eating and drinking; upon which the gentleman's &s;i&s;ter, who was pre&s;ent, could not &s;uppre&s;s her indignation: <Q REND="inline">"What, Sir, (&s;aid &s;he,) are you &s;o unfeeling, as not even to offer to go to my brother in his di&s;tre&s;s; you who have been &s;o much obliged to him?"</Q> And that John&s;on an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Madam, I owe him no obligation; what he did for me he would have done for a dog."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on a&s;&s;ured me, that the &s;tory was ab&s;olutely fal&s;e; but like a man con&s;cious of being in the right, and de&s;irous of completely vindicating him|&s;elf from &s;uch a charge, he did not arrogantly re&s;t on a mere denial, and on his general character, but proceeded thus:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sir, I was very intimate with that gentleman, and was once relieved by him from an arre&s;t; but I never was pre&s;ent when he was arre&s;ted, never knew that he was arre&s;ted, and I believe he never was in difficulties after the time when he relieved me. I loved him much; yet, in talking of his general character, I may have &s;aid, though I do not remember that I ever did &s;o, that as his genero&s;ity proceeded from no principle, but was a part of his profu&s;ion, he would do for a dog what he would do for a friend: but I never applied this remark to any par|ticular in&s;tance, and certainly not to his kindne&s;s to me. If a profu&s;e man, who does not value his money, and gives a large &s;um to a whore, gives half as much, or an equally large &s;um to relieve a friend, it cannot be e&s;teemed as virtue. This was all that I could &s;ay of that gentleman; and, if &s;aid at all, it mu&s;t have been &s;aid after his death. Sir, I would have gone to the world's end to relieve him. The remark about the dog, if made by me, was &s;uch a &s;ally as might e&s;cape one when painting a man highly."</Q></P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, September 23, John&s;on was remarkably cordial to me. It being nece&s;&s;ary for me to return to Scotland &s;oon, I had fixed on the next day for my &s;etting out, and I felt a tender concern at the thought of parting
<PB N="171" REF="173" MS="y">
with him. He had, at this time, frankly communicated to me many parti|culars,  which are in&s;erted in this work in their proper places; and once, when I happened to mention that the expence of my jaunt would come to much more than I had computed, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, if the expence were to be an inconvenience, you would have rea&s;on to regret it: but, if you have had the money to &s;pend, I know not that you could have purcha&s;ed as much plea&s;ure with it in any other way."</Q></P>
<P>During this interview at A&s;hbourne, John&s;on and I frequently talked with wonderful plea&s;ure of mere trifles which had occurred in our tour to the Hebrides; for it had left a mo&s;t agreeable and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion upon his mind.</P>
<P>He found fault with me for u&s;ing the phra&s;e to <HI>make</HI> money. <Q REND="inline">"Don't you &s;ee (&s;aid he) the impropriety of it? To <HI>make</HI> money is to <HI>coin</HI> it: you &s;hould &s;ay <HI>get</HI> money."</Q> The phra&s;e, however, is, I think, pretty current. But John&s;on was at all times jealous of infractions upon the genuine Engli&s;h language, and prompt to repre&s;s colloquial barbari&s;ms; &s;uch as, <HI>pledging my&s;elf,</HI> for <HI>undertaking; line,</HI> for <HI>department</HI> or <HI>branch,</HI> as, the <HI>civil line,</HI> the <HI>banking line.</HI> He was particularly indignant again&s;t the almo&s;t univer&s;al u&s;e of the word <HI>idea</HI> in the &s;en&s;e of <HI>notion</HI> or <HI>opinion,</HI> when it is clear that <HI>idea</HI> can only &s;ignify &s;omething of which an image can be formed in the mind. We may have an <HI>idea</HI> or <HI>image</HI> of a mountain, a tree, a building; but we cannot &s;urely have an <HI>idea</HI> or <HI>image</HI> of an <HI>argument</HI> or <HI>propo&s;ition.</HI> Yet we hear the &s;ages of the law <Q REND="inline">"delivering their <HI>ideas</HI> upon the que&s;tion under con&s;ideration;"</Q> and the fir&s;t &s;peakers in parliament <Q REND="inline">"entirely coinciding in the <HI>idea</HI> which has been ably &s;tated by an honourable member;"</Q>&mdash;or <Q REND="inline">"reprobating an <HI>idea</HI> uncon|&s;titutional and fraught with the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences to a great and free country."</Q> John&s;on called this <Q REND="inline">"modern cant."</Q></P>
<P>I perceived that he pronounced the word <HI>heard,</HI> as if &s;pelt with a double <HI>e, heerd,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;ounding it <HI>herd,</HI> as is mo&s;t u&s;ually done. He &s;aid, his rea&s;on was, that if it were pronounced <HI>herd,</HI> there would be a &s;ingle exception from the Engli&s;h pronunciation of the &s;yllable <HI>ear,</HI> and he thought it better not to have that exception.</P>
<P>He prai&s;ed Granger's <Q REND="inline">"Ode on Solitude,"</Q> in Dod&s;ley's collection, and repeated, with great energy, the exordium:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"O Solitude, romantick maid,</L>
<L>"Whether by nodding towers you tread;</L>
<L>"Or haunt the de&s;art's trackle&s;s gloom,</L>
<L>"Or hover o'er the yawning tomb;</L>
<L><PB N="172" REF="174" MS="y">
 "Or climb the Andes' clifted &s;ide,</L>
<L>"Or by the Nile's coy &s;ource abide;</L>
<L>"Or, &s;tarting from your half-year's &s;leep,</L>
<L>"From Hecla view the thawing deep;</L>
<L>"Or, at the purple dawn of day,</L>
<L>"Tadnor's marble wa&s;tes &s;urvey."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>ob&s;erving, <Q REND="inline">"This, Sir, is very noble."</Q></P>
<P>In the evening our gentleman-farmer, and two others, entertained them|&s;elves and the company with a great number of tunes on the fiddle. John&s;on de&s;ired to have <Q REND="inline">"Let ambition fire thy mind,"</Q> played over again, and appeared to give a patient attention to it; though he owned to me that he was very in&s;en&s;ible to the power of mu&s;ick. I told him, that it affected me to &s;uch a degree, as often to agitate my nerves painfully, producing in my mind alternate &s;en&s;ations of pathetick dejection, &s;o that I was ready to &s;hed tears; and of daring re&s;olution, &s;o that I was inclined to ru&s;h into the thicke&s;t part of a battle. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) I &s;hould never hear it, if it made me &s;uch a fool."</Q></P>
<P>Much of the effect of mu&s;ick, I am &s;atisfied, is owing to a&s;&s;ociation of ideas. That air, which in&s;tantly and irre&s;i&s;tibly excites in the Swi&s;s, when in a foreign land, the <HI>maladie du pais,</HI> has, I am told, no intrin&s;ick power of &s;ound. And I know from my own experience, that Scotch reels, though bri&s;k, make me melancholy, becau&s;e I u&s;ed to hear them in my early years, at a time when Mr. Pitt called for &s;oldiers <Q REND="inline">"from the mountains of the north,"</Q> and numbers of brave Highlanders were going abroad, never to return. Whereas the airs in <Q REND="inline">"The Beggar's Opera,"</Q> many of which are very &s;oft, never fail to render me gay, becau&s;e they are a&s;&s;ociated with the warm &s;en&s;ations and high &s;pirits of London. This evening, while &s;ome of the tunes of ordinary compo&s;ition were played with no great &s;kill, my frame was agitated, and I was con&s;cious of a generous attachment to Dr. John&s;on, as my preceptor and friend, mixed with an affectionate regret that he was an old man, whom I &s;hould probably lo&s;e in a &s;hort time. I thought I could defend him at the point of my &s;word. My reverence and affection for him were in full glow. I &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir, we mu&s;t meet every year, if you don't quarrel with me."</Q> JOHNSON <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, you are more likely to quarrel with me, than I with you. My regard for you is greater almo&s;t than I have words to expre&s;s; but I do not choo&s;e to be always repeating it,
<PB N="173" REF="175" MS="y">
write it down in the fir&s;t leaf of your pocket-book, and never doubt of it  again."</Q></P>
<P>I talked to him of mi&s;ery being <Q REND="inline">"the doom of man,"</Q> in this life, as di&s;|played in his <Q REND="inline">"Vanity of Human Wi&s;hes."</Q> Yet I ob&s;erved that things were done upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of happine&s;s; grand hou&s;es were built, fine gardens were made, &s;plendid places of publick amu&s;ement were contrived, and crowded with company. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Alas, Sir, the&s;e are all only &s;truggles for happine&s;s. When I fir&s;t entered Ranelagh, it gave an expan&s;ion and gay &s;en&s;ation to my mind, &s;uch as I never experienced any where el&s;e. But, as Xerxes wept when he viewed his immen&s;e army, and con&s;idered that not one of that great multitude would be alive a hundred years afterwards, &s;o it went to my heart to con&s;ider that there was not one in all that brilliant circle, that was not afraid to go home and think; but that the thoughts of each individual there, would be di&s;tre&s;&s;ing when alone."</Q> This reflection was experimentally ju&s;t. The feeling of languor <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Pope mentions,
<Q><L>"Stretch'd on the rack of a too ea&s;y chair,"</L></Q>
But I recollect a couplet quite appo&s;ite to my &s;ubject in <Q REND="inline">"Virtue, an Ethick Epi&s;tle,"</Q> a beau|tiful and in&s;tructive poem, by an anonymous writer, in 1758; who, treating of plea&s;ure in exce&s;s, &s;ays,
<Q><L>"Till languor, &s;uffering on the rack of bli&s;s,</L>
<L>"Confe&s;s that man was never made for this."</L></Q></NOTE>, which &s;ucceeds the animation of gaiety, is it&s;elf a very &s;evere pain; and when the mind is then vacant, a thou&s;and di&s;appointments and vexations ru&s;h in and excruciate. Will not many even of my faire&s;t readers allow this to be true?</P>
<P>I &s;ugge&s;ted, that being in love, and flattered with hopes of &s;ucce&s;s; or having &s;ome favourite &s;cheme in view for the next day, might prevent that wretched|ne&s;s of which we had been talking&punc; JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, it may &s;ometimes be &s;o as you &s;uppo&s;e; but my conclu&s;ion is in general but too true."</Q></P>
<P>While John&s;on and I &s;tood in calm conference by our&s;elves in Dr. Taylor's garden, at a pretty late hour, in a &s;erene autumn night, looking up to the heavens, I directed the di&s;cour&s;e to the &s;ubject of a future &s;tate. My friend was in a placid and mo&s;t benignant frame. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) I do not imagine that all things will be made clear to us immediately after death, but that the ways of Providence will be explained to us very gradually."</Q> I ventured to a&s;k him whether although the words of &s;ome texts of Scripture &s;eemed &s;trong in &s;upport of the dreadful doctrine of an eternity of puni&s;hment, we might not hope that the denunciation was figurative, and would not literally be executed.
<PB N="174" REF="176" MS="y">
 JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you are to con&s;ider the intention of puni&s;hment in a future &s;tate. We have no rea&s;on to be &s;ure that we &s;hall then be no longer liable to offend again&s;t GOD. We do not know that even the angels are quite in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity; nay we know that &s;ome of them have fallen. It may, therefore, perhaps be nece&s;&s;ary, in order to pre&s;erve both men and angels in a &s;tate of rectitude, that they &s;hould have continually before them the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e who have deviated from it; but we may hope that by &s;ome other means a fall from rectitude may be prevented.

<P>After &s;upper I accompanied him to his apartment, and at my reque&s;t he dictated to me an argument in favour of the negro who was then claiming his liberty, in an action in the Court of Se&s;&s;ion in Scotland <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">This being laid up &s;omewhere amid&s;t my multiplicity of papers at Auchinleck, has e&s;caped my &s;earch for this work; but, when &s;ound, I &s;hall take care that my readers &s;hall have it.</NOTE>. He had always been very zealous again&s;t &s;lavery in every form, in which I with all deference thought that he di&s;covered <Q REND="inline">"a zeal without knowledge."</Q> Upon one occa&s;ion, when in company with &s;ome very grave men at Oxford, his toa&s;t was, <Q REND="inline">"Here's to the next in&s;urrection of the negroes in the We&s;t-Indies."</Q> His violent prejudice again&s;t our We&s;t-Indian and American &s;ettlers appeared whenever there was an opportunity. Towards the conclu&s;ion of his <Q REND="inline">"Taxation no Tyranny,"</Q> he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"how is it that we hear the loude&s;t <HI>yelps</HI> for liberty among the drivers of negroes?"</Q> and in his conver&s;ation with Mr. Wilkes <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">See page 88 of this volume.</NOTE>, he a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"Where did Beckford and Trecothick learn Engli&s;h?"</Q> That Trecothick could both &s;peak and write good Engli&s;h is well known. I my&s;elf was favoured with his corre&s;pondence concerning the brave Cor&s;icans.

<P>Had I been as attentive not to di&s;plea&s;e him as I ought to have been, I know not but this vigil might have been fulfilled; but I unluckily entered
<PB N="175" REF="177" MS="y">
upon the controver&s;y concerning the right of Great-Britain to tax America,  and attempted to argue in favour of our fellow-&s;ubjects on the other &s;ide of the Atlantick. I in&s;i&s;ted that America might be very well governed, and made to yield a &s;ufficient revenue by the means of <HI>influence,</HI> as exem|plified in Ireland, while the people might be plea&s;ed with the imagination of their participating of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, by having a body of re|pre&s;entatives without who&s;e con&s;ent money could not be exacted from them. John&s;on could not bear my thus oppo&s;ing his avowed opinion, which he had exerted him&s;elf with an extreme degree of heat to enforce; and the violent agitation into which he was thrown while an&s;wering, or rather reprimanding me, alarmed me &s;o that I heartily repented of my having unthinkingly introduced the &s;ubject. I my&s;elf however grew warm, and the change was great, from the calm &s;tate of philo&s;ophical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in which we had a little before been plea&s;ingly employed.</P>
<P>I talked of the corruption of the Briti&s;h parliament, in which I alledged that any que&s;tion, however unrea&s;onable or unju&s;t, might be carried by a venal majority, and I &s;poke with high admiration of the Roman Senate, as if compo&s;ed of men &s;incerely de&s;irous to re&s;olve what they &s;hould think be&s;t for their country. My friend would allow no &s;uch character to the Roman Senate; and he maintained that the Briti&s;h parliament was not corrupt, and that there was no occa&s;ion to corrupt its members, a&s;&s;erting, that there was hardly ever any que&s;tion of great importance before parliament, any que&s;tion in which a man might not very well vote either upon one &s;ide or the other. He &s;aid there had been none in his time except that re&s;pecting America.</P>
<P>We were fatigued by the conte&s;t, which was produced by my want of caution; and he was not then in the humour to &s;lide into ea&s;y and cheerful talk. It therefore &s;o happened, that we were after an hour or two very willing to &s;eparate and go to bed.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, September 24, I went into Dr. John&s;on's room before he got up, and finding that the &s;torm of the preceding night was quite laid, I &s;at down upon his bed-&s;ide, and he talked with as much readine&s;s and good|humour as ever. He recommended to me to plant a con&s;iderable part of a large moori&s;h farm which I had purcha&s;ed, and he made &s;everal calculations of the expence and profit, for he delighted in exerci&s;ing his mind on the &s;cience of numbers. He pre&s;&s;ed upon me the importance of planting at the fir&s;t in a very &s;ufficient manner, quoting the &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"In bello non licet bis errare;"</Q> and adding <Q REND="inline">"this is equally true in planting."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="178" MS="y">
 I &s;poke with gratitude of Dr. Taylor's ho&s;pitality; and as evidence that it was not on account of his good table alone that John&s;on vi&s;ited him often, I mentioned a little anecdote which had e&s;caped my friend's recollection, and at hearing which repeated, he &s;miled. One evening when I was &s;itting with him, Frank delivered this me&s;&s;age, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, Dr. Taylor &s;ends his compli|ments to you, and begs you will dine with him to-morrow. He has got a hare."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My compliments (&s;aid John&s;on,) and I'll dine with him, hare or rabbit."</Q></P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t I departed, and pur&s;ued my journey northwards. I took my po&s;t-chai&s;e from the Green Man, a very good inn at A&s;hbourne, the mi&s;tre&s;s of which, a mighty civil gentlewoman, curt&s;eying very low, pre&s;ented me with an engraving of the &s;ign of her hou&s;e; to which &s;he had &s;ubjoined, in her own hand-writing, an addre&s;s in &s;uch &s;ingular &s;implicity of &s;tyle, that I have pre&s;erved it pa&s;ted upon one of the boards of my original Journal at this time, and &s;hall here in&s;ert it for the amu&s;ement of my readers:</P>

<P>From this meeting at A&s;hbourne I derived a con&s;iderable acce&s;&s;ion to my John&s;onian &s;tore. I communicated my original Journal to Sir William Forbes, in whom I have always placed de&s;erved confidence; and what he wrote to me concerning it is &s;o much to my credit as the biographer of John&s;on, that my readers will, I hope, grant me their indulgence for here in&s;erting it, <Q REND="inline">"It is not once or twice going over it (&s;ays Sir William) that will &s;atisfy me; for I find in it a high degree of in&s;truction as well as enter|tainment; and I derive more benefit from Dr. John&s;on's admirable di&s;cu&s;&s;ions than I &s;hould be able to draw from his per&s;onal conver&s;ation; for, I &s;uppo&s;e there is not a man in the world to whom he di&s;clo&s;es his &s;entiments &s;o freely as to your&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>I cannot omit a curious circum&s;tance which occurred at Eden&s;or-inn, clo&s;e by Chat&s;worth, to &s;urvey the magnificence of which I had gone a con&s;iderable way out of my road to Scotland. The inn was then kept by a very joll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">

landlord, who&s;e name I think was Malton. He happened to mention that  <Q REND="inline">"the celebrated Dr. John&s;on had been in his hou&s;e."</Q> I inquired <HI>who</HI> this Dr. John&s;on was, that I might hear mine ho&s;t's notion of him. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) John&s;on, the great writer; <HI>Oddity,</HI> as they call him.

<P>My friend, who had a thorough dependance upon the authenticity of my relation without any <HI>embelli&s;hment,</HI> as <HI>fal&s;ehood</HI> or <HI>fiction</HI> is too gently called, laughed a good deal at this repre&s;entation of him&s;elf.</P>

<P>BY the fir&s;t po&s;t I inform you of my &s;afe arrival at my own hou&s;e, and that I had the comfort of finding my wife and children all in good health.</P>
<P>When I look back upon our late interview, it appears to me to have an&s;wered expectation better than almo&s;t any &s;cheme of happine&s;s that I ever put in execution. My Journal is &s;tored with wi&s;dom and wit; and my memory is filled with the recollection of lively and affectionate feelings, which now, I think, yield me more &s;atisfaction than at the time when they were fir&s;t excited. I have experienced this upon other occa&s;ions. I will be obliged to you if you will explain it to me; for it &s;eems wonderful that plea&s;ure &s;hould be more vivid at a di&s;tance than when near. I wi&s;h you may find your&s;elf in the humour to do me this favour; but I flatter my&s;elf with no &s;trong hope of it; for I have ob&s;erved, that unle&s;s upon very &s;erious occa&s;ions, your letters to me are not <HI>an&s;wers</HI> to tho&s;e which I write.</P>
<P>[I then expre&s;&s;ed to him much unea&s;ine&s;s that I had mentioned to him the name of the gentleman who had told me the &s;tory &s;o much to his di&s;advan|tage, the truth of which he had completely refuted; for that my having done &s;o might be interpreted as a breach of confidence, and offend one who&s;e &s;ociety I valued:&mdash;therefore earne&s;tly reque&s;ting that no notice might be taken of it to any body, till I &s;hould be in London, and have an opportunity to talk it over with the gentleman.]</P>

<P>YOU will wonder, or you have wondered, why no letter has come from me. What you wrote at your return, had in it &s;uch a &s;train of cowardly caution as gave me no plea&s;ure. I could not well do what you
<PB N="178" REF="180" MS="y">
 wi&s;hed; I had no need to vex you with a refu&s;al. I have &s;een Mr.&mdash;, and as to him have &s;et all right, without any inconvenience, &s;o far as I know, to you. Mrs. Thrale had forgot the &s;tory. You may now be at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>And at ea&s;e I certainly wi&s;h you, for the kindne&s;s that you &s;howed in coming &s;o long a journey to &s;ee me. It was pity to keep you &s;o long in pain, but, upon reviewing the matter, I do not &s;ee what I could have done better than as I did.</P>
<P>I hope you found at your return my dear enemy and all her little people quite well, and had no rea&s;on to repent your journey. I think on it with great gratitude.</P>
<P>I was not well when you left me at the Doctor's, and I grew wor&s;e; yet I &s;taid on, and at Lichfield was very ill. Travelling, however, did not make me wor&s;e; and when I came to London I complied with a &s;ummons to go to Brighthelm&s;ton, where I &s;aw Beauclerk, and &s;taid three days.</P>
<P>Our club has recommenced la&s;t Friday, but I was not there. Langton has another wench <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">A daughter born to him.</NOTE>. Mrs. Thrale is in hopes of a young brewer. They got by their trade la&s;t year a very large &s;um, and their expences are proportionate.</P>
<P>Mrs. Williams's health is very bad. And I have had for &s;ome time a very difficult and laborious re&s;piration, but I am better by purges, ab&s;tinence, and other methods. I am yet however much behind-hand in my health and re&s;t.</P>
<P>Dr. Blair's &s;ermons are now univer&s;ally commended&punc; but let him think that I had the honour of fir&s;t finding and fir&s;t prai&s;ing his excellencies. I did not &s;tay to add my voice to that of the publick.</P>
<P>My dear friend, let me thank you once more for your vi&s;it; you did me great honour, and I hope met with nothing that di&s;plea&s;ed you. I &s;taid long at A&s;hbourne, not much plea&s;ed, yet aukward at departing. I then went to Lichfield, where I found my friend at Stowhill<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Mrs. A&s;ton.</NOTE> very dangerou&s;ly di&s;ea&s;ed. Such is life. Let us try to pa&s;s it well, whatever it be, for there is &s;urely &s;omething beyond it.</P>
<P>Well, now I hope all is well, write as &s;oon as you can to,</P>

<P>This day's po&s;t has at length relieved me from much unea&s;ine&s;s, by bringing me a letter from you. I was, indeed, doubly unea&s;y;&mdash;on my

own account and yours. I was very anxious to be &s;ecured again&s;t any bad  con&s;equences from my imprudence in mentioning the gentleman's name who had told me a &s;tory to your di&s;advantage; and as I could hardly &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible, that you would delay &s;o long to make me ea&s;y, unle&s;s you was ill, I was not a little apprehen&s;ive about you. You mu&s;t not be offended when I venture to tell you that you appear to me to have been too rigid upon this occa&s;ion. The <HI>'cowardly caution which gave you no plea&s;ure,'</HI> was &s;ugge&s;ted to me by a friend here, to whom I mentioned the &s;trange &s;tory and the detection of its fal&s;ity, as an in&s;tance how one may be deceived by what is apparently very good authority. But, as I am &s;till per&s;uaded, that as I might have obtained the truth, without mentioning the gentleman's name, it was wrong in me to do it, I cannot &s;ee that you are ju&s;t in blaming my caution. But if you were ever &s;o ju&s;t in your di&s;approbation, might you not have dealt more tenderly with me?</P>
<P>I went to Auchinleck about the middle of October, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time with my father very comfortably.</P>
<P>I am engaged in a criminal pro&s;ecution again&s;t a country &s;choolma&s;ter, for indecent behaviour to his female &s;cholars.

<P>About this time I wrote to John&s;on, giving him an account of the deci&s;ion of the <HI>Negro cau&s;e,</HI> by the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, which by tho&s;e who hold even the milde&s;t and be&s;t regulated &s;lavery in abomination, (of which number I do not he&s;itate to declare that I am none,) &s;hould be remembered with high re&s;pect, and to the credit of Scotland; for it went upon a much broader ground than the ca&s;e of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> which was decided in England <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">See State Trials, Vol. XI. p. 339, and Mr. Hargrave's argument.</NOTE>; being truly the general que&s;tion, whether a perpetual obligation of &s;ervice to one ma&s;ter in any mode &s;hould be &s;anctioned by the law of a free country. A negro, then called <HI>Jo&s;eph Knight,</HI> a native of Africa, who having been brought to Jamaica in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of the &s;lave trade, and purcha&s;ed by a Scotch gentleman in that i&s;land, had attended his ma&s;ter to Scotland, where it was
<PB N="180" REF="182">
 officiou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;ted to him that he would be found entitled to his liberty without any limitation. He accordingly brought his action, in the cour&s;e of which the advocates on both &s;ides did them&s;elves great honour. Mr. Maclaurin has had the prai&s;e of John&s;on, for his argument <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">The motto to it was happily cho&s;en:
<Q><L>"&mdash;Nimium ne crede colori."</L></Q>
I cannot avoid mentioning a circum&s;tance no le&s;s &s;trange than true, that a brother Advocate in con&s;iderable practice, but of whom it certainly cannot be &s;aid, <HI>Ingenuas didicit fideliter artes,</HI> a&s;ked Mr. Maclaurin, with a face of flippant a&s;&s;urance, <Q REND="inline">"Are the&s;e words your own?"</Q></NOTE> in favour of the negro, and Mr. Macconochie di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf on the &s;ame &s;ide, by his ingenuity and extraordinary re&s;earch. Mr. Cullen, on the part of the ma&s;ter, di&s;covered good information and &s;ound rea&s;oning; in which he was well &s;upported by Mr. James Fergu&s;&s;on, a man remarkable for a manly under&s;tanding, and a knowledge both of books and of the world. But I cannot too highly prai&s;e the &s;peech which Mr. Henry Dundas generou&s;ly contributed to the cau&s;e of the &s;ooty &s;tranger. Mr. Dundas's Scotti&s;h accent, which has been &s;o often in vain obtruded as an objection to his powerful abilities in parliament, was no di&s;advantage to him in his own country. And I do declare, that upon this memorable que&s;tion he impre&s;&s;ed me, and I believe all his audience, with &s;uch feelings as were produced by &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent orations of antiquity. This te&s;timony I liberally give to the excel|lence of an old friend, with whom it has been my lot to differ very widely upon many political topicks; yet I per&s;uade my&s;elf without malice. A great majority of the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion decided for the negro. But four of their number, the Lord Pre&s;ident, Lord Elliock, Lord Monboddo, and Lord Covington, re&s;olutely maintained the lawfulne&s;s of a <HI>&s;tatus,</HI> which has been acknowledged in all ages and countries, and that when freedom flouri&s;hed, as in old Greece and Rome.</P>

<P>Your alarm at your lady's illne&s;s was rea&s;onable, and not di&s;proportionate to the appearance of the di&s;order.

<P>WHY I have delayed, for near a month, to thank you for your la&s;t affectionate letter, I cannot &s;ay; for my mind has been in better health the&s;e three weeks than for &s;ome years pa&s;t. I believe I have evaded till I could &s;end you a copy of Lord Hailes's opinion on the negro's cau&s;e, which he wi&s;hes you to read, and correct any errours that there may be in the language; for, &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">'we live in a critical, though not a learned age; and I &s;eek to &s;creen my&s;elf under the &s;hield of Ajax.'</Q> I communicated to him your apology for keeping the &s;heets of his 'Annals' &s;o long. He &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">'I am &s;orry to &s;ee that Dr. John&s;on is in a &s;tate of languor. Why &s;hould a &s;ober Chri&s;tian, neither an enthu&s;ia&s;t nor a fanatick, be very merry or very &s;ad?'</Q> I envy his Lord&s;hip's comfortable con&s;titution: but well do I know that languor and dejection will afflict the be&s;t, however excellent their principles. I am in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lord Hailes's opinion in his own hand-writing, and have had it for &s;ome time. My excu&s;e then for procra&s;tination mu&s;t be, that I wanted to have it copied; and I have now put that off &s;o long, that it will be better to bring it with me than &s;end it, as I &s;hall probably get you to look at it &s;ooner when I &s;olicit you in per&s;on.</P>
<P>My wife, who is, I thank GOD, a good deal better, is much obliged to you for your very polite and courteous offer of your apartment: but, if &s;he goes to London, it will be be&s;t for her to have lodgings in the more airy vicinity of Hyde-Park. I, however, doubt much if I &s;hall be able to pre|vail with her to accompany me to the metropolis, for &s;he is &s;o different from you and me, that &s;he di&s;likes travelling; and &s;he is &s;o anxious about her children, that &s;he thinks &s;he &s;hould be unhappy if at a di&s;tance from them. She therefore wi&s;hes rather to go to &s;ome country place in Scotland, where &s;he can have them with her.</P>
<P>I purpo&s;e being in London about the 20th of next month, as I think it creditable to appear in the Hou&s;e of Lords as one of Douglas's Coun&s;el, in the great and la&s;t competition between Duke Hamilton and him.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry poor Mrs. Williams is &s;o ill: though her temper is unplea&s;ant, &s;he has always been polite and obliging to me. I wi&s;h many happy years to

<P>YOU are at pre&s;ent bu&s;y among&s;t the Engli&s;h Poets, preparing, for the publick in&s;truction and entertainment, Prefaces, biographical and critical. It will not, therefore, be out of &s;ea&s;on to appeal to you for the deci&s;ion of a controver&s;y which has ari&s;en between a lady and me con|cerning a pa&s;&s;age in Parnell. That poet tells us, that his Hermit quitted his cell</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>'&mdash;to know the world by &s;ight,</L>
<L>'To find if <HI>books</HI> or <HI>&s;wains</HI> report it right;</L>

<L>'Who&s;e feet came wand'ring o'er the nightly dew).'</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>I maintain, that there is an incon&s;i&s;tency here; for as the Hermit's notions of the world were formed from the reports both of <HI>books</HI> and <HI>&s;wains,</HI> he could not ju&s;tly be &s;aid to know by <HI>&s;wains alone.</HI> Be plea&s;ed to judge between us, and let us have your rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>What do you &s;ay to <HI>'Taxation no Tyranny'</HI> now, after Lord North's declaration, or confe&s;&s;ion, or whatever el&s;e his conciliatory &s;peech &s;hould be called? I never differed from you on politicks but upon two points&mdash;the Middle&s;ex Election, and the Taxation of the Americans by the Briti&s;h <HI>Hou&s;es of Repre&s;entatives.</HI> There is a <HI>charm</HI> in the word <HI>Parliament,</HI> &s;o I avoid it. As I am a &s;teady and a warm Tory, I regret that the King does not &s;ee it to be better for him to receive con&s;titutional &s;upplies from his American &s;ubjects by the voice of their own a&s;&s;emblies, where his Royal Per&s;on is repre&s;ented, than through the medium of his Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.

<P>THE alarm of your late illne&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me but for a few hours; for on the evening of the day that it reached me, I found it contradicted in 'The London Chronicle,' which I could depend upon as authentick con|cerning you, Mr. Strahan being the printer of it. I did not &s;ee the paper in which <Q REND="inline">'the approaching extinction of a bright luminary'</Q> was announced. Sir William Forbes told me of it; and he &s;ays, he &s;aw me &s;o unea&s;y, that he did not give me the report in &s;uch &s;trong terms as he had read it. He after|wards &s;ent me a letter from Mr. Langton to him, which relieved me much. I am, however, not quite ea&s;y, as I have not heard from you; and now I &s;hall not have that comfort before I &s;ee you, for I &s;et out for London to|morrow before the po&s;t comes in.

<P>On Wedne&s;day, March 18, I arrived in London, and was informed by good Mr. Francis that his ma&s;ter was better, and was gone to Mr. Thrale's at Streatham, to which place I wrote to him, begging to know when he would be in town. He was not expected for &s;ome time; but next day having called on Dr. Taylor, in Dean's-yard, We&s;tmin&s;ter, I found him there, and was told he had come to town for a few hours. He met me with his
<PB N="186" REF="188" MS="y">
 u&s;ual kindne&s;s, but in&s;tantly returned to the writing of &s;omething on which he was employed when I came in, and on which he &s;eemed much intent. Finding him thus engaged, I made my vi&s;it very &s;hort, and had no more of his conver&s;ation, except his expre&s;&s;ing a &s;erious regret that a friend of ours was living at too much expence, con&s;idering how poor an appearance he made: <Q REND="inline">"If (&s;aid he) a man has &s;plendour from his expence, if he &s;pends his money in pride or in plea&s;ure, he has value: but if he lets others &s;pend it for him, which is mo&s;t commonly the ca&s;e, he has no advantage from it."</Q></P>
<P>On Friday, March 20, I found him at his own hou&s;e, &s;itting with Mrs. Williams, and was informed that the room formerly allotted to me was now appropriated to a charitable purpo&s;e; Mrs. De&s;moulins <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Daughter of Dr. Swin&s;en, John&s;on's godfather, and widow of Mr. De&s;moulins, a writing-ma&s;ter.</NOTE>, and I think her daughter, and a Mi&s;s Carmichael, being all lodged in it. Such was his humanity, and &s;uch his genero&s;ity, that Mrs. De&s;moulins her&s;elf told me, he allowed her half-a-guinea a week. Let it be remembered, that this was above a twelfth part of his pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>His liberality, indeed, was at all periods of his life very remarkable. Mr. Howard, of Lichfield, at who&s;e father's hou&s;e John&s;on had in his early years been kindly received, told me, that when he was a boy at the Charter-Hou&s;e, his father wrote to him to go and pay a vi&s;it to Mr. Samuel John&s;on, which he accordingly did, and found him in an upper room, of poor appearance. John&s;on received him with much courteou&s;ne&s;s, and talked a great deal to him, as to a &s;chool-boy, of the cour&s;e of his education, and other particulars. When he afterwards came to know and under&s;tand the high character of this great man, he recollected his conde&s;cen&s;ion with wonder. He added, that when he was going away, Mr. John&s;on pre&s;ented him with half-a-guinea; and this, &s;aid Mr. Howard, was at a time when he probably had not another.</P>
<P>We retired from Mrs. Williams to another room. Tom Davies &s;oon after joined us. He had now unfortunately failed in his circum&s;tances, and was much indebted to Dr. John&s;on's kindne&s;s for obtaining for him many allevia|tions of his di&s;tre&s;s. After he went away, John&s;on blamed his folly in quitting the &s;tage, by which he and his wife got five hundred pounds a year. I &s;aid, I believed it was owing to Churchill's attack upon him,
<Q><L>"He mouths a &s;entence as curs mouth a bone."</L></Q>
JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I believe &s;o too, Sir. But what a man is he who is to be driven from the &s;tage by a line? Another line would have driven him from his &s;hop."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="189" MS="y">
I told him, that I was engaged as Coun&s;el at the bar of the Hou&s;e of  Commons to oppo&s;e a road-bill in the county of Stirling, and a&s;ked him what mode he would advi&s;e me to follow in addre&s;&s;ing &s;uch an audience. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, you mu&s;t provide your&s;elf with a good deal of extraneous matter, which you are to produce occa&s;ionally, &s;o as to fill up the time; for you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that they do not li&s;ten much. If you begin with the &s;trength of your cau&s;e, it may be lo&s;t before they begin to li&s;ten. When you catch a moment of attention, pre&s;s the merits of the que&s;tion upon them."</Q> He &s;aid, as to one point of the merits, that he thought <Q REND="inline">"it would be a wrong thing to deprive the &s;mall landholders of the privilege of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves for making and repairing the high roads; <HI>it was de&s;troying &s;o much liberty, without a good rea&s;on, which was always a bad thing.</HI>"</Q> When I men|tioned this ob&s;ervation next day to Mr. Wilkes, he plea&s;antly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"What! does <HI>he</HI> talk of liberty? <HI>Liberty</HI> is as ridiculous in <HI>his</HI> mouth as <HI>Religion</HI> in <HI>mine.</HI>"</Q> Mr. Wilkes's advice, as to the be&s;t mode of &s;peaking at the bar of the Hou&s;e of Commons, was not more re&s;pectful towards the &s;enate, than that of Dr. John&s;on. <Q REND="inline">"Be as impudent as you can, as merry as you can, and &s;ay whatever comes uppermo&s;t. Jack Lee is the be&s;t heard there of any Coun&s;el; and he is the mo&s;t impudent dog, and always abu&s;ing us."</Q></P>
<P>In my interview with Dr. John&s;on this evening, I was quite ea&s;y, quite as his companion; upon which I find in my Journal the following reflection: <Q REND="inline">"So ready is my mind to &s;ugge&s;t matter for di&s;&s;atisfaction, that I felt a &s;ort of regret that I was &s;o ea&s;y. I mi&s;&s;ed that aweful reverence with which I u&s;ed to contemplate <HI>Mr. Samuel John&s;on,</HI> in the complex magnitude of his literary, moral, and religious character. I have a wonderful &s;uper&s;titious love of <HI>my&s;tery;</HI> when, perhaps, the truth is, that it is owing to the cloudy darkne&s;s of my own mind. I &s;hould be glad that I am more advanced in my progre&s;s of being, &s;o that I can view Dr. John&s;on with a &s;teadier and clearer eye. My di&s;&s;atisfaction to-night was fooli&s;h. Would it not be fooli&s;h to regret that we &s;hall have le&s;s my&s;tery in a future &s;tate? That we 'now &s;ee in a gla&s;s darkly,' but &s;hall 'then &s;ee face to face?"</Q>&mdash;This reflection, which I thus freely communicate, will be valued by the thinking part of my readers, who may have them&s;elves experienced &s;imilar &s;tates of mind.</P>
<P>He returned next day to Streatham, to Mr. Thrale's; where, as Mr. Strahan once complained to me, <Q REND="inline">"he was in a great mea&s;ure ab&s;orbed from the &s;ociety of his old friends."</Q> I was kept in London by bu&s;ine&s;s, and wrote to him on the 27th, that <Q REND="inline">"a &s;eparation from him for a week, when we were
<PB N="188" REF="190" MS="y">
 &s;o near, was equal to a &s;eparation for a year, when we were at four hundred miles di&s;tance."</Q> I went to Streatham on Monday, March 30. Before he appeared, Mrs. Thrale made a very characteri&s;tical remark:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I do not know for certain what will plea&s;e Dr. John&s;on: but I know for certain that it will di&s;plea&s;e him to prai&s;e any thing, even what he likes, extravagantly."</Q></P>
<P>At dinner he laughed at querulous declamations again&s;t the age, on account of luxury&mdash;increa&s;e of London&mdash;&s;carcity of provi&s;ions&mdash;and other &s;uch topicks. <Q REND="inline">"Hou&s;es (&s;aid he) will be built till rents fall; and corn is more plentiful now than ever it was."</Q></P>
<P>I had before dinner repeated a ridiculous &s;tory told me by an old man who had been a pa&s;&s;enger with me in the &s;tage-coach to-day. Mrs. Thrale, having taken occa&s;ion to allude to it in talking to me, called it <Q REND="inline">"The &s;tory told you by the old <HI>woman.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Now, Madam, (&s;aid I,) give me leave to catch you in the fact: it was not an old <HI>woman,</HI> but an old <HI>man,</HI> whom I mentioned as having told me this."</Q> I pre&s;umed to take an opportunity, in pre&s;ence of John&s;on, of &s;hewing this lively lady how ready &s;he was, uninten|tionally, to deviate from exact authenticity of narration.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Thomas &agrave; Kempis (he ob&s;erved) mu&s;t be a good book, as the world has opened its arms to receive it. It is &s;aid to have been printed, in one language or other, as many times as there have been months &s;ince it fir&s;t came out. I always was &s;truck with this &s;entence in it: 'Be not angry that you cannot make others as you wi&s;h them to be, &s;ince you cannot make your&s;elf as you wi&s;h to be."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I was angry with Hurd about Cowley, for having publi&s;hed a &s;election of his works: but, upon better con&s;ideration, I think there is no impropriety in a man's publi&s;hing as much as he choo&s;es of any authour, if he does not put the re&s;t out of the way. A man, for in&s;tance, may print the Odes of Horace alone."</Q> He &s;eemed to be in a more indulgent humour than when this &s;ubject was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed between him and Mr. Murphy <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">See p. 59 of this Volume.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When we were at tea and coffee, there came in Lord Trimble&s;town, in who&s;e family was an ancient Iri&s;h peerage, but it &s;uffered by taking the gene|rous &s;ide in the troubles of the la&s;t century. He was a man of plea&s;ing conver&s;ation, and was accompanied by a young gentleman, his &s;on.</P>
<P>I mentioned that I had in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the Life of Sir Robert Sibbald, the celebrated Scotti&s;h antiquary, and founder of the Royal College of Phy&s;icians at Edinburgh, in the original manu&s;cript in his own hand-writing; and
<PB N="189" REF="191" MS="y">
that it was I believed the mo&s;t natural and candid account of him&s;elf that ever  was given by any man. As an in&s;tance, he tells that the Duke of Perth, then Chancellor of Scotland, pre&s;&s;ed him very much to come over to the Roman-Catholick Faith; that he re&s;i&s;ted all his Grace's arguments for a con&s;iderable time, till one day he felt him&s;elf as it were in&s;tantaneou&s;ly con|vinced, and with tears in his eyes ran into the Duke's arms, and embraced the ancient religion; that he continued very &s;teady in it for &s;ome time, and accompanied his Grace to London one winter, and lived in his hou&s;ehold; that there he found the rigid fa&s;ting pre&s;cribed by the church very &s;evere upon him; that this di&s;po&s;ed him to recon&s;ider the controver&s;y, and having then &s;een that he was in the wrong, he returned to Prote&s;tanti&s;m. I talked of &s;ome time or other publi&s;hing this curious life. MRS. THRALE. <Q REND="inline">"I think you had as well let alone that publication. To di&s;cover &s;uch weakne&s;s expo&s;es a man when he is gone."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, it is an hone&s;t picture of human nature. How often are the primary motives of our greate&s;t actions as &s;mall as Sibbald's, for his re-conver&s;ion."</Q> MRS. THRALE. <Q REND="inline">"But may they not as well be forgotten?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Madam, a man loves to review his own mind. That is the u&s;e of a diary, or journal."</Q> LORD TRIMBLESTOWN. <Q REND="inline">"True, Sir. As the ladies love to &s;ee them&s;elves in a gla&s;s; &s;o a man likes to &s;ee him&s;elf in his journal."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"A very pretty allu&s;ion."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, indeed."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"And as a lady adju&s;ts her dre&s;s before a mirror, a man adju&s;ts his character by looking at his journal."</Q> I next year found the very &s;ame thought in Atterbury's <Q REND="inline">"Sermon on Lady Cutts."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"In this gla&s;s &s;he every day dre&s;&s;ed her mind."</Q> This is a proof of coincidence, and not of plagiari&s;m; for I had never read that &s;ermon before.</P>
<P>Next morning, while we were at breakfa&s;t, John&s;on gave a very earne&s;t recommendation of what he him&s;elf practi&s;ed with the utmo&s;t con&s;cientiou&s;|ne&s;s: I mean a &s;trict attention to truth, even in the mo&s;t minute particulars. <Q REND="inline">"Accu&s;tom your children (&s;aid he) con&s;tantly to this; if a thing happened at one window, and they, when relating it, &s;ay that it happened at another, do not let it pa&s;s, but in&s;tantly check them; you do not know where deviation from truth will end."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"It may come to the door; and when once an account is at all varied in one circum&s;tance, it may by degrees be varied &s;o as to be totally different from what really happened."</Q> Our lively ho&s;te&s;s, who&s;e fancy was impatient of the rein, fidgeted at this, and ventured to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Nay, this is too much. If Mr. John&s;on &s;hould forbid me to drink tea I would comply, as I &s;hould feel the re&s;traint only twice a day; but little variations in narrative mu&s;t happen a thou&s;and times a day, if one is not
<PB N="190" REF="192" MS="y">
 perpetually watching."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Well, Madam, and you <HI>ought</HI> to be perpetually watching. It is more from carele&s;&s;ne&s;s about truth than from intentional lying, that there is &s;o much fal&s;ehood in the world."</Q></P>
<P>In his review of Dr. Warton's <Q REND="inline">"E&s;&s;ay on the Writings and Genius of Pope,"</Q> John&s;on has given the following &s;alutary caution upon this &s;ubject: <Q REND="inline">"Nothing but experience could evince the frequency of fal&s;e information, or unable any man to conceive that &s;o many groundle&s;s reports &s;hould be pro|pagated, as every man of eminence may hear of him&s;elf. Some men relate what they think, as what they know; &s;ome men of confu&s;ed memories and habitual inaccuracy, a&s;cribe to one man what belongs to another; and &s;ome talk on, without thought or care. A few men are &s;ufficient to broach fal&s;e|hoods, which are afterwards innocently diffu&s;ed by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive relaters <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Literary Magazine, 1756, p. 37.</NOTE>."</Q> Had he lived to read what Sir John Hawkins and Mrs. Piozzi have related concerning him&s;elf, how much would he have found his ob&s;ervation illu&s;|trated. He was indeed, &s;o much impre&s;&s;ed with the prevalence of fal&s;ehood, voluntary or unintentional, that I never knew any per&s;on who upon hearing an extraordinary circum&s;tance told, di&s;covered more of the <HI>incredulus odi.</HI> He would &s;ay with a &s;ignificant look and deci&s;ive tone, <Q REND="inline">"It is not &s;o. Do not tell this again."</Q> He inculcated upon all his friends the importance of perpetual vigilance again&s;t the &s;lighte&s;t degrees of fal&s;ehood, the effect of which, as Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds ob&s;erved to me, has been, that all who were of his &s;chool are di&s;tingui&s;hed for a love of truth and accuracy, which they would not have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame degree, if they had not been known to John&s;on.</P>
<P>Talking of gho&s;ts, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It is wonderful&punc; that five thou&s;and years have now elap&s;ed &s;ince the creation of the world, and &s;till it is undecided whether or not there&punc; has ever been an in&s;tance of the &s;pirit of any per&s;on appearing after death. All argument is again&s;t it; but all belief is for it.</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"John We&s;ley's conver&s;ation is good, but he is never at lei&s;ure. He is always obliged to go at a certain hour. This is very di&s;agreeable to a man who loves to fold his legs and have out his talk, as I do."</Q></P>
<P>On Friday, April 3, I dined with him in London, in a company where were pre&s;ent &s;everal eminent men, whom I &s;hall not name, but di&s;tingui&s;h their parts in the conver&s;ation by different letters.</P>
<P>F. <Q REND="inline">"I have been looking at this famous antique marble dog of Mr. Jennings, valued at a thou&s;and guineas, &s;aid to be Alcibiades's dog."</Q>
<PB N="191" REF="193" MS="y">
JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"His tail then mu&s;t be docked. That was the mark of Alci|biades's  dog."</Q> E. <Q REND="inline">"A thou&s;and guineas! The repre&s;entation of no animal whatever is worth &s;o much. At this rate a dead dog would indeed be better than a living lion."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is not the worth of the thing, but of the &s;kill in forming it which is &s;o highly e&s;timated. Every thing that enlarges the &s;phere of human powers, that &s;hows man he can do what he thought he could not do, is valuable. The fir&s;t man who balanced a &s;traw upon his no&s;e; John&s;ton who rode upon three hor&s;es at a time; in &s;hort, all &s;uch men de&s;erved the applau&s;e of mankind, not on account of the u&s;e of what they did, but of the dexterity which they exhibited."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Yet a mi&s;application of time and a&s;&s;iduity is not to be encouraged. Addi&s;on, in one of his 'Spectators' commends the judgement of a King, who as a &s;uitable reward to a man that by long per&s;everance had attained to the art of throwing a barley-corn through the eye of a needle, gave him a bu&s;hel of barley."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"He has been a King of Scotland, where barley is &s;carce."</Q> F. <Q REND="inline">"One of the mo&s;t remarkable antique figures of an animal is the boar at Florence."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"The fir&s;t boar that is well made in marble &s;hould be pre&s;erved as a wonder.

<P>E. <Q REND="inline">"We hear prodigious complaints at pre&s;ent of emigration.

 BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I can under&s;tand that emigration may be the cau&s;e that more people may be produced in a country; but the country will not therefore be from that the more populous, for the people i&s;&s;ue from it.

<P>R. <Q REND="inline">"Mr. E. I don't mean to flatter, but when po&s;terity reads one of your &s;peeches in parliament, it will be difficult to believe that you took &s;o much pains, knowing with certainty that it could produce no effect, that not one vote would be gained by it."</Q> E. <Q REND="inline">"Waving your compliment to me, I &s;hall &s;ay in general, that it is very well worth while for a man to take pains to &s;peak well in parliament. A man, who has vanity, &s;peaks to di&s;play his talents; and if a man &s;peaks well, he gradually e&s;tabli&s;hes a certain reputation and con&s;equence in the general opinion, which &s;ooner or later will have its political reward. Be&s;ides, though not one vote is gained, a good &s;peech has its effect. Though an act which has been ably oppo&s;ed pa&s;&s;es into a law, yet in its progre&s;s it is modelled, it is &s;oftened in &s;uch a manner, that we &s;ee plainly the mini&s;ter has been told, that the members attached to him are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of its inju&s;tice or ab&s;urdity from what they have heard, that it mu&s;t be altered."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"And, Sir, there is a gratification of pride.

It is a ma&s;s by no means pure; but neither is it wholly corrupt, though there is a large pro|portion of corruption in it.

But intere&s;t will not make us do every thing. In a ca&s;e which admits of doubt, we try to think on the &s;ide which is for our intere&s;t, and generally bring our|&s;elves to act accordingly. But the &s;ubject mu&s;t admit of diver&s;ity of colouring; it mu&s;t receive a colour on that &s;ide. In the Hou&s;e of Commons there are members enough who will not vote what is gro&s;sly unju&s;t or ab&s;urd. No, Sir, there mu&s;t always be right enough, or appearance of right, to keep wrong in countenance."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"There is &s;urely always a majority in parliament who have places, or who want to have them, and who therefore will be generally ready to &s;upport government without requiring any pretext."</Q> E. <Q REND="inline">"True, Sir; that majority will always follow

<P>On Saturday, April 4, I drank tea with John&s;on at Dr. Taylor's, where he had dined.

It is hardly to be believed what ab&s;urd and indecent images men will intro|duce into their writings, without being &s;en&s;ible of the ab&s;urdity and indecency.

She &s;aid, &s;he would &s;end to Mr. Pulteney, who, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, could inform her. So then, to prevent her from making her&s;elf ridiculous, Lord Orrery &s;ent her Grace a note, in which he gave her to under&s;tand what was meant."</Q></P>
<P>He was very &s;ilent this evening; and read in a variety of books; &s;uddenly throwing down one, and taking up another.</P>
<P>He talked of going to Streatham that night. TAYLOR. <Q REND="inline">"You'll be robbed if you do; or you mu&s;t &s;hoot a highwayman.

<P>Thrale's carriage not having come for him, as he expected, I accom|panied him &s;ome part of the way home to his own hou&s;e.

Harris is a &s;ound &s;ullen &s;cholar; he does not like interlopers. Harris, however, is a prig, and a bad prig <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">What my friend meant by the&s;e words concerning the amiable philo&s;opher of Sali&s;bury, I am at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand.</NOTE>.

But &s;ometimes things may be made darker by definition. I &s;ee a <HI>cow.</HI> I define her, <HI>Animal quadrupes ruminans cornutum.</HI> But a goat ruminates, and a cow may have no horns. <HI>Cow</HI> is plainer."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I think Dr. Franklin's definition of <HI>Man</HI> a good one&mdash;'A tool-making animal."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But many a man never made a tool: and &s;uppo&s;e a man without arms, he could not make a tool."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of drinking wine, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I did not leave off wine becau&s;e I could not bear it: I have drunk three bottles of port without being the wor&s;e for it. Univer&s;ity College has witne&s;&s;ed this."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Why then, Sir, did you leave it off?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, becau&s;e it is &s;o much better for a man to be &s;ure that he is never to be intoxicated, never to lo&s;e the power over him&s;elf. I &s;hall not begin to drink wine again till I grow old, and want it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I think, Sir, you once &s;aid to me, that not to drink wine was a great deduction from life<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See p. 154 of this Volume.</NOTE></Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It is a diminution of plea&s;ure, to be &s;ure; but I do not &s;ay a diminution of happine&s;s.

The greate&s;t part of men would compound for plea&s;ure."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Suppo&s;ing we could have plea&s;ure always, an intellectual man would not compound for it. The greate&s;t part of men would compound, becau&s;e the greate&s;t part of men are gro&s;s."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I allow there may be greater plea&s;ure than from wine. I have had more plea&s;ure from your conver&s;ation. I have indeed; I a&s;&s;ure you I have."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"When we talk of plea&s;ure, we mean &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure. When a man &s;ays he had plea&s;ure with a woman, he does not mean conver&s;ation, but &s;omething of a very different nature. Philo&s;ophers tell you, that plea&s;ure is <HI>contrary</HI> to happine&s;s. Gro&s;s men prefer animal plea&s;ure. So
<PB N="200" REF="202" MS="y">
 there are men who have preferred living among &s;avages. Now what a wretch mu&s;t he be, who is content with &s;uch conver&s;ation as can be had among &s;avages!

<P>I mentioned to him that I had become very weary in a company where I heard not a &s;ingle intellectual &s;entence, except that <Q REND="inline">"a man who had been &s;ettled ten years in Minorca was become a much inferiour man to what he was in London, becau&s;e a man's mind grows narrow in a narrow place."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"A man's mind grows narrow in a narrow place, who&s;e mind is enlarged only becau&s;e he has lived in a large place: but what is got by books and thinking is pre&s;erved in a narrow place as well as well as in a large place.

I can talk twice as much in London as any where el&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Of Gold&s;mith he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He was not an agreeable companion, for he talked always for fame. A man who does &s;o never can be plea&s;ing. The man who talks to unburthen his mind is the man to delight you. An eminent friend of ours is not &s;o agreeable as the variety of his knowledge would otherwi&s;e make him, becau&s;e he talks partly from o&s;tentation."</Q></P>
<P>Soon after our arrival at Thrale's, I heard one of the maids calling eagerly on another, to go to Dr. John&s;on. I wondered what this could mean. I afterwards learnt, that it was to give her a Bible which he had brought from London as a pre&s;ent to her.</P>
<P>He was for a con&s;iderable time occupied in reading <Q REND="inline">"Memoires de Fontenelle;"</Q> leaning and &s;winging upon the low gate into the court, without his hat.</P>
<P>I looked into Lord Kames's <Q REND="inline">"Sketches of the Hi&s;tory of Man;"</Q> and mentioned to Dr. John&s;on his cen&s;ure of Charles the Fifth, for celebrating his funeral ob&s;equies in his life-time, which, I told him, I had been u&s;ed to think a &s;olemn and affecting act. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, a man may di&s;|po&s;e his mind to think &s;o of that act of Charles; but it is &s;o liable to
<PB N="201" REF="203" MS="y">
ridicule, that if one man out of ten thou&s;and laughs at it, he'll make the  other nine thou&s;and nine hundred and ninety-nine laugh too."</Q> I could not agree with him in this.</P>
<P>Sir John Pringle had expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h that I would a&s;k Dr. John&s;on's opinion what were the be&s;t Engli&s;h &s;ermons for &s;tyle. I took an oppor|tunity to-day of mentioning &s;everal to him. <HI>Atterbury?</HI> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, one of the be&s;t."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Tillot&s;on?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why not now. I &s;hould not advi&s;e a preacher at this day to imitate Tillot&s;on's &s;tyle; though I don't know; I &s;hould be cautious of objecting to what has been applauded by &s;o many &s;uffrages.&mdash;<HI>South</HI> is one of the be&s;t, if you except his peculiarities, and his violence, and &s;ometimes coar&s;ene&s;s of language.&mdash;<HI>Seed</HI> has a very fine &s;tyle; but he is not very theological.&mdash;<HI>Jortin's</HI> &s;ermons are very elegant.&mdash;<HI>Sherlock's</HI> &s;tyle too is very elegant, though he has not made it his principal &s;tudy.&mdash;And you may add <HI>Smallridge.</HI> All the latter preachers have a good &s;tyle.

However, it is very well known <HI>where</HI> he was not orthodox, which was upon the doctrine of the Trinity, as to which he is a condemned heretick; &s;o one is aware of it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I like Ogden's &s;ermons on prayer very much, both for neatne&s;s of &s;tyle and &s;ubtilty of rea&s;oning."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould like to read all that Ogden has written."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"What I wi&s;h to know is, what &s;ermons afford the be&s;t &s;pecimen of Engli&s;h pulpit eloquence."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"We have no &s;ermons addre&s;&s;ed to the pa&s;&s;ions that are good for any thing; if you mean that kind of eloquence."</Q> A CLERGYMAN. (who&s;e name I do not recollect) <Q REND="inline">"Were not Dodd's &s;ermons addre&s;&s;ed to the pa&s;&s;ions?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"They were nothing, Sir, be they addre&s;&s;ed to what they may."</Q></P>
<P>At dinner, Mrs. Thrale expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to go and &s;ee Scotland. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Seeing Scotland, Madam, is only &s;eeing a wor&s;e England. It is &s;eeing the flower gradually fade away to the naked &s;talk. Seeing the Hebrides, indeed, is &s;eeing quite a different &s;cene."</Q></P>
<P>Our poor friend, Mr. Thomas Davies, was &s;oon to have a benefit at Drury|lane theatre, as &s;ome relief to his unfortunate circum&s;tances. We were all warmly intere&s;ted for his &s;ucce&s;s, and had contributed to it. However, we thought there was no harm in having our joke when he could not be hurt by it. I propo&s;ed that he &s;hould be brought on to &s;peak a Prologue upon the occa|&s;ion; and I began to mutter fragments of what it might be: as, that when
<PB N="202" REF="204" MS="y">
 now grown <HI>old,</HI> he was obliged to cry, <Q REND="inline">"Poor Tom's <HI>a-cold;</HI>"</Q>&mdash;that he owned he had been driven from the &s;tage by a Churchill, but that this was no di&s;grace, for a Churchill had beat the French;&mdash;that he had been &s;atyri&s;ed as <Q REND="inline">"mouthing a &s;entence as curs mouth a bone,"</Q> but he was now glad of a bone to pick.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Nay, (&s;aid John&s;on,) I would have him to &s;ay,
<Q><L>'Mad Tom is come to &s;ee the world again."</L></Q></Q></P>
<P>He and I returned to town in the evening. Upon the road I endeavoured to maintain, in argument, that a landed gentleman is not under any obliga|tion to re&s;ide upon his e&s;tate; and that by living in London he does no injury to his country. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, he does no injury to his country in general, becau&s;e the money which he draws from it gets back again in circulation; but to his particular di&s;trict, his particular pari&s;h, he does an injury. All that he has to give away is not given to tho&s;e who have the fir&s;t claim to it. And though I have &s;aid that the money circulates back, it is a long time before that happens. Then, Sir, a man of family and e&s;tate ought to con&s;ider him&s;elf as having the charge of a di&s;trict, over which he is to diffu&s;e civility and happine&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Next day I found him at home in the forenoon. He prai&s;ed Delaney's <Q REND="inline">"Ob&s;ervations on Swift;"</Q> &s;aid that his book and Lord Orrery's might both be true, though one viewed Swift more, and the other le&s;s favourably; and that, between both, we might have a complete notion of Swift.</P>
<P>Talking of a man's re&s;olving to deny him&s;elf the u&s;e of wine, from moral and religious con&s;iderations, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He mu&s;t not doubt about it. When one doubts as to plea&s;ure, we know what will be the conclu&s;ion. I now no more think of drinking wine, than a hor&s;e does. The wine upon the table is no more for me, than for the dog that is under the table."</Q></P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, April 9, I dined with him at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's, with the Bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, (Dr. Shipley,) Mr. Allan Ram&s;ay, Mr. Gibbon, Mr. Cambridge, and Mr. Langton. Mr. Ram&s;ay had lately returned from Italy, and entertained us with his ob&s;ervations upon Horace's villa, which he had examined with great care. I reli&s;hed this much, as it brought fre&s;h into my mind what I had viewed with great plea&s;ure thirteen years before. The Bi&s;hop, Dr. John&s;on, and Mr. Cambridge, joined with Mr. Ram&s;ay, in recollecting the various lines in Horace relating to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Horace's journey to Brundu&s;ium being mentioned, John&s;on ob&s;erved, that the brook which he de&s;cribes is to be &s;een now, exactly as at that time;
<PB N="203" REF="205" MS="y">
and that he had often wondered how it happened, that &s;mall brooks, &s;uch as  this, kept the &s;ame &s;ituation for ages, notwith&s;tanding earthquakes, by which even mountains have been changed, and agriculture, which produces &s;uch a variation upon the &s;urface of the earth. CAMBRIDGE. <Q REND="inline">"A Spani&s;h writer has this thought in a poetical conceit. After ob&s;erving that mo&s;t of the &s;olid &s;tructures of Rome are totally peri&s;hed, while the Tiber remains the &s;ame, he adds,
<Q><L>'Lo que era Firme hui&oacute; i &s;olamente,</L>
<L>'Lo Fugitivo permanece i dura."</L></Q></Q>
JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, that is taken from <HI>Janus Vitalis:</HI>
<Q><L>'&mdash;immota labe&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">unt;</L>
<L>'Et quae perpetu&ograve; &s;unt agitata manent."</L></Q></Q></P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop &s;aid, it appeared from Horace's writings that he was a cheerful contented man. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"We have no rea&s;on to believe that, my Lord. Are we to think Pope was happy, becau&s;e he &s;ays &s;o in his writings? We &s;ee in his writings what he wi&s;hed the &s;tate of his mind to appear. Dr. Young, who pined for preferment, talks with contempt of it in his writings, and affects to de&s;pi&s;e every thing that he did not de&s;pi&s;e."</Q> BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH. <Q REND="inline">"He was like other chaplains, looking for vacancies: but that is not peculiar to the clergy. I remember when I was with the army, after the battle of Lafeldt, the officers &s;eriou&s;ly grumbled that no General was killed."</Q> CAMBRIDGE. <Q REND="inline">"We may believe Horace more when he &s;ays,
<Q><L>'Romae Tibur amem vento&s;us Tibure Romam."</L></Q></Q>
BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"How hard is it that man can never be at re&s;t."</Q> RAMSAY. <Q REND="inline">"It is not in his nature to be at re&s;t. When he is at re&s;t he is in the wor&s;t &s;tate that he can be in, for he has nothing to agitate him. He is then like the man in the Iri&s;h &s;ong,
<Q><L>'There was an old fellow at Ballanacrazy,</L>
<L>'Who wanted a wife for to make him unai&s;y."</L></Q></Q>
Gold&s;mith being mentioned, John&s;on ob&s;erved that it was long before his merit came to be acknowledged. That he once complained to him, in ludicrous terms of di&s;tre&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"Whenever I write any thing, the publick <HI>make a point</HI> to know nothing about it:"</Q> but that his <Q REND="inline">"Traveller"</Q> brought him into high reputation. LANGTON. <Q REND="inline">"There is not one bad line in that poem;
<PB N="204" REF="206" MS="y">
 not one of Dryden's carele&s;s ver&s;es."</Q> SIR JOSHUA. <Q REND="inline">"I was glad to hear Charles Fox &s;ay it was one of the fine&s;t poems in the Engli&s;h language."</Q> LANGTON. <Q REND="inline">"Why was you glad? You &s;urely had no doubt of this before."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No; the merit of 'The Traveller' is &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, that Mr. Fox's prai&s;e cannot augment it, nor his cen&s;ure dimini&s;h it."</Q> SIR JOSHUA. <Q REND="inline">"But his friends may &s;u&s;pect they had a too great partiality for him."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, the partiality of his friends was all again&s;t him. It was with difficulty we could give him a hearing. Gold&s;mith had no &s;ettled notions upon any &s;ubject; &s;o he talked always at random. It &s;eemed to be his intention to blurt out whatever was in his mind, and &s;ee what would become of it. He was angry too when catched in an ab&s;urdity; but it did not prevent him from falling into another the next minute. I remember Chamier, after talking with him for &s;ome time, &s;aid, 'Well, I do believe he wrote this poem him&s;elf: and, let me tell you, that is believing a great deal.' Chamier once a&s;ked him what he meant by <HI>&s;low,</HI> the la&s;t word in the fir&s;t line of 'The Traveller,'
<Q><L>'Remote, unfriended, melancholy, &s;low.'</L></Q>
Did he mean tardine&s;s of locomotion? Gold&s;mith, who would &s;ay &s;ome|thing without con&s;ideration, an&s;wered, 'Yes.' I was &s;itting by, and &s;aid, 'No, Sir; you do not mean tardine&s;s of locomotion; you mean, that &s;lug|gi&s;hne&s;s of mind which comes upon a man in &s;olitude. Chamier believed then that I had written the line, as much as if he had &s;een me write it. Gold&s;mith, however, was a man, who, whatever he wrote, did it better than any other man could do. He de&s;erved a place in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, and every year he lived, would have de&s;erved it better. He had, indeed, been at no pains to fill his mind with knowledge. He tran&s;planted it from one place to another; and it did not &s;ettle in his mind; &s;o he could not tell what was in his own books."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of living in the country. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No wi&s;e man will go to live in the country, unle&s;s he has &s;omething to do which can be better done in the country. For in&s;tance: if he is to &s;hut him&s;elf up for a year to &s;tudy a &s;cience, it is better to look out to the fields, than to an oppo&s;ite wall. Then, if a man walks out in the country, there is nobody to keep him from walking in again: but if a man walks out in London, he is not &s;ure when he &s;hall walk in again. A great city is, to be &s;ure, the &s;chool for &s;tudying life; and 'The proper &s;tudy of mankind is man,' as Pope ob&s;erves."</Q> BOSWELL.
<PB N="205" REF="207" MS="y">
<Q REND="inline">"I fancy London is the be&s;t place in the world for &s;ociety; though I have  heard that the very fir&s;t &s;ociety of Paris is &s;till beyond any thing that we have here."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I que&s;tion if in Paris &s;uch a company as is &s;itting round this table could be got together in le&s;s than half a year. They talk in France of the felicity, of men and women living together: the truth is, that there the men are not higher than the women, they know no more than women do, and they are not held down in their conver&s;ation by the pre&s;ence of women."</Q> RAMSAY. <Q REND="inline">"Literature is upon the growth, it is in its &s;pring in France. Here it is rather <HI>pa&s;&s;ee.</HI>"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Literature was in France long before we had it. Paris was the &s;econd city for the revival of letters: Italy had it fir&s;t, to be &s;ure. What have we done for literature, equal to what was done by the Stephani and others in France. Our literature came to us through France. Caxton printed only two books, Chaucer and Gower, that were not tran&s;lations from the French; and Chaucer, we know, took much from the Italians. No, Sir, if literature be in its &s;pring in France, it is a &s;econd &s;pring; it is after a winter. We are now before the French in literature; but we had it long after them. In England, any man who wears a &s;word and a powdered wig is a&s;hamed to be illiterate. I believe it is not &s;o in France. Yet there is, probably, a great deal of learning in France, becau&s;e they have &s;uch a number of religious e&s;tabli&s;hments; &s;o many men who have nothing el&s;e to do but to &s;tudy. I do not know this; but I take it upon the common principles of chance. Where there are many &s;hooters, &s;ome will hit."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of old age. John&s;on (now in his &s;eventieth year) &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It is a man's own fault, it is from want of u&s;e, if his mind grows torpid in old age."</Q> The Bi&s;hop a&s;ked, if an old man does not lo&s;e fa&s;ter than he gets. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I think not, my Lord, if he exerts him&s;elf."</Q> One of the com|pany ra&s;hly ob&s;erved, that he thought it was happy for an old man that in&s;en&s;ibility comes upon him&punc; JOHNSON. (with a noble elevation and di&s;dain) <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, I &s;hould never be happy by being le&s;s rational."</Q> BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH. <Q REND="inline">"Your wi&s;h then, Sir, is <GAP DESC="foreign">"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip mentioned a charitable e&s;tabli&s;hment in Wales, where people were maintained, and &s;upplied with every thing, upon the condition of their contributing the weekly produce of their labour; and he &s;aid, they grew quite torpid for want of property. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"They have no object for hope. Their condition cannot be better. It is rowing without a port."</Q></P>
<P>One of the company a&s;ked him the meaning of the expre&s;&s;ion in Juvenal, <HI>unius lacertae.</HI> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I think it clear enough; as much ground as one may have a chance to find a lizard upon."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="208" MS="y">
 Commentators have differed as to the exact meaning of the expre&s;&s;ion by which the Poet intended to en&s;orce the &s;entiment contained in the pa&s;&s;age where the&s;e words occur. It is enough that they mean to denote even a very &s;mall po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, provided it be a man's own.</P>
<Q><L>"E&s;t aliquid quocunque loco quocunque rece&s;&s;u,</L>
<L>"Unius &s;e&s;e dominum feci&s;&s;e lacertae."</L></Q>
<P>This &s;ea&s;on there was a whim&s;ical fa&s;hion in the new&s;papers of applying Shak&s;peare's words to de&s;cribe living people well known in the world; which was done under the title of <Q REND="inline">"Modern Characters from Shak&s;peare;"</Q> many of which were admirably adapted. The fancy took &s;o much, that they were afterwards collected into a pamphlet. Somebody &s;aid to John&s;on, acro&s;s the table, that he had not been in tho&s;e characters. <Q REND="inline">"Yes (&s;aid he) I have. I &s;hould have been &s;orry to be left out."</Q> He then repeated what had been applied to him,
<Q><L>"I mu&s;t borrow GARAGANTUA'S mouth."</L></Q>
Mi&s;s Reynolds not perceiving at once the meaning of this, he was obliged to explain it to her, which had &s;omething of an aukward and ludicrous effect. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Madam, it has a reference to me as u&s;ing big words, which require the mouth of a giant to pronounce them. Garagantua is the name of a giant in Rabelais."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, there is another among&s;t them for you:
<Q><L>'He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,</L>
<L>'Or Jove for his power to thunder."</L></Q></Q>
JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"There is nothing marked in that. No, Sir, Garagantua is the be&s;t."</Q> Notwith&s;tanding this ea&s;e and good humour, when I, a little while afterwards, repeated his farca&s;m on Kenrick <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See p. 271 of Vol. I.</NOTE>, which was received with applau&s;e, he a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Who</HI> &s;aid that?"</Q> and on my &s;uddenly an&s;wering, <HI>Garagantua,</HI> he looked &s;erious, which was a &s;ufficient indication that he did not wi&s;h it to be kept up.</P>
<P>When we went to the drawing-room there was a rich a&s;&s;emblage. Be&s;ides the company who had been at dinner, there were Mr. Garrick, Mr. Harris of Sali&s;bury, Dr. Percy, Dr. Burney, Honourable Mrs. Cholmondeley, Mi&s;s Hannah More, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>After wandering about in a kind of plea&s;ing di&s;traction for &s;ome time, I got into a corner, with John&s;on, Garrick, and Harris. GARRICK. (to Harris)

(to John&s;on) <Q REND="inline">"And what think you, Sir, of it?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I thought what I read of it <HI>verbiage:</HI> but upon Mr. Harris's recommendation I will read a play. (To Mr. Harris.) Don't pre|&s;cribe two."</Q> Mr. Harris &s;ugge&s;ted one, I do not remember which. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"We mu&s;t try its effect as an Engli&s;h poem; that is the way to judge of the merit of a tran&s;lation. Tran&s;lations are, in general, for people who cannot read the original."</Q> I mentioned the vulgar &s;aying, that Pope's Homer was not a good repre&s;entation of the original. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is the greate&s;t work of the kind that has ever been produced."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"The truth is, it is impo&s;&s;ible perfectly to tran&s;late poetry. In a different language it may be the &s;ame tune, but it has not the &s;ame tone. Homer plays it on a ba&s;&s;oon; Pope on a flagelet."</Q> HARRIS. <Q REND="inline">"I think heroick poetry is be&s;t in blank ver&s;e; yet it appears that rhyme is e&s;&s;ential to Engli&s;h poetry, from our deficiency in metrical quantities. In my opinion, the chief excellence of our language is numerous pro&s;e."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir William Temple was the fir&s;t writer who gave cadence to Engli&s;h pro&s;e. Before his time they were carele&s;s of arrangement, and did not mind whether a &s;entence ended with an important word or an in&s;ignificant word, or with what part of &s;peech it was concluded."</Q> Mr. Langton, who now had joined us, commended Clarendon. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"He is objected to for his parenthe&s;es, his involved clau&s;es, and his want of harmony. But he is &s;upported by his matter. It is, indeed, owing to a plethory of matter that his &s;tyle is &s;o faulty. Every <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> (&s;miling to Mr. Harris) has &s;o many <HI>accidents.</HI>&mdash;To be di&s;tinct, we mu&s;t talk <HI>analytically.</HI> If we analy&s;e language, we mu&s;t &s;peak of it grammatically; if we analy&s;e argument, we mu&s;t &s;peak of it logically."</Q> GARRICK. <Q REND="inline">"Of all the tran&s;lations that ever were attempted, I think Elphin&s;ton's Martial the mo&s;t extraordinary. He con&s;ulted me upon it, who am a little of an epigrammati&s;t my&s;elf you know. I told him freely, 'You don't &s;eem to have that turn.' I a&s;ked him if he was &s;erious; and finding he was, I advi&s;ed him again&s;t publi&s;hing. Why his tran&s;lation is more difficult to under&s;tand than the original. I thought him a man of &s;ome talents; but he &s;eems crazy in this."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you have done what I had not courage to do. But he did not a&s;k my advice, and I did not force it upon him to make him angry with me."</Q> GARRICK. <Q REND="inline">"But as a friend, Sir&mdash;"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why &s;uch a friend as I am with him&mdash;no."</Q> GARRICK. <Q REND="inline">"But if you &s;ee a friend going to tumble over a precipice?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"That is an extravagant ca&s;e, Sir. You are &s;ure a friend will thank you for hindering him from tumbling over a precipice:
<PB N="208" REF="210" MS="y">
 but, in the other ca&s;e, I &s;hould hurt his vanity, and do him no good. He would not take my advice. His brother-in-law, Strahan, &s;ent him a &s;ub|&s;cription of fifty pounds, and &s;aid he would &s;end him fifty more, if he would not publi&s;h."</Q> GARRICK. <Q REND="inline">"What! eh! is Strahan a good judge of an Epigram? Is not he rather an <HI>obtu&s;e</HI> man, eh?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, he may not be a judge of an Epigram: but you &s;ee he is a judge of what is <HI>not</HI> an Epigram."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"It is ea&s;y for you, Mr. Garrick, to talk to an authour as you talked to Elphin&s;ton: you, who have been &s;o long the manager of a theatre, rejecting the plays of poor authours. You are an old Judge, who have often pronounced &s;entence of death. You are a practi&s;ed &s;urgeon, who have often amputated limbs; and though this may have been for the good of your patients, they cannot like you. Tho&s;e who have under|gone a dreadful operation are not very fond of &s;eeing the operator again."</Q> GARRICK. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, I know enough of that. There was a reverend gentle|man (Mr. Hawkins) who wrote a tragedy, the &s;iege of &s;omething, which I refu&s;ed."</Q> HARRIS. <Q REND="inline">"So the &s;iege was rai&s;ed."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Aye, he came to me and complained; and told me, that Garrick &s;aid his play was wrong in the <HI>concoction.</HI> Now, what is the concoction of a play?"</Q> (Here Garrick &s;tarted, and twi&s;ted him&s;elf, and &s;eemed &s;orely vexed; for John&s;on told me he believed the &s;tory was true.) GARRICK. <Q REND="inline">"I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&s;aid <HI>fir&s;t</HI> concoction.</Q> JOHNSON. (&s;miling) <Q REND="inline">"Well, he left out <HI>fir&s;t.</HI> And Rich, he &s;aid, refu&s;ed him <HI>in fal&s;e Engli&s;h:</HI> he could &s;hew it under his hand."</Q> GARRICK. <Q REND="inline">"He wrote to me in violent wrath for having refu&s;ed his play: 'Sir, this is growing a very &s;erious and terrible affair. I am re&s;olved to publi&s;h my play. I will appeal to the world; and how will your judgement appear?' I an&s;wered, 'Sir, notwith&s;tanding all the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and all the terrours, I have no objection to your publi&s;hing your play; and as you live at a great di&s;tance, (Devon&s;hire, I believe,) if you will &s;end me it, I will convey it to the pre&s;s.' I never heard more of it, ha! ha! ha!"</Q></P>
<P>On Friday, April 10, I found John&s;on at home in the forenoon. We re&s;umed the conver&s;ation of ye&s;terday. He put me in mind of &s;ome of it which had e&s;caped my memory, and enabled me to record it more perfectly than I otherwi&s;e could have done. He was much plea&s;ed with my paying &s;o great attention to his recommendation in 1763, the beginning of our acquaintance, to keep a journal; and I could perceive he was &s;ecretly plea&s;ed to find &s;o much of the fruit of his mind pre&s;erved; and as he had been u&s;ed to imagine and &s;ay that he always laboured when he &s;aid a good thing&mdash;it
<PB N="209" REF="211" MS="y">
delighted him, on a review, to find that his conver&s;ation teemed with  point and imagery.</P>
<P>I &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"You were ye&s;terday, Sir, in remarkably good humour: but there was nothing to offend you, nothing to produce irritation or violence. There was no bold offender. There was not one capital conviction. It was a maiden a&s;&s;ize. You had on your white gloves."</Q></P>
<P>He found fault with our friend Langton for having been too &s;ilent. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid I,) you will recollect, that he very properly took up Sir Jo&s;hua for being glad that Charles Fox had prai&s;ed Gold&s;mith's 'Traveller,' and you joined him."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, I knocked Fox on the head, without cere|mony. Reynolds is too much under Fox and Burke at pre&s;ent. He is under the <HI>Fox &s;tar</HI> and the <HI>Iri&s;h con&s;tellation.</HI> He is always under &s;ome planet."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"There is no Fox &s;tar."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But there is a dog &s;tar."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"They &s;ay, indeed, a fox and a dog are the &s;ame animal."</Q></P>
<P>I reminded him of a gentleman who, Mrs. Cholmondeley &s;aid, was fir&s;t talkative from affectation, and then &s;ilent from the &s;ame cau&s;e; that he fir&s;t thought, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall be celebrated as the livelie&s;t man in every company;"</Q> and then, all at once, <Q REND="inline">"O! it is much more re&s;pectable to be grave and look wi&s;e."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"He has rever&s;ed the Pythagorean di&s;cipline, by being fir&s;t talkative, and then &s;ilent. He rever&s;es the cour&s;e of Nature too: he was fir&s;t the gay butterfly, and then the creeping worm."</Q> John&s;on laughed loud and long at this expan&s;ion and illu&s;tration of what he him&s;elf had told me.</P>
<P>We dined together with Mr. Scott (now Sir William Scott, his Maje&s;ty's Advocate) at his chambers in the Temple, nobody el&s;e there. The company being &s;mall, John&s;on was not in &s;uch &s;pirits as he had been ye&s;terday, and for a con&s;iderable time little was &s;aid. At la&s;t he bur&s;t forth, <Q REND="inline">"Subordina|tion is &s;adly broken down in this age. No man, now, has the &s;ame authority which his father had&mdash;except a gaoler. No ma&s;ter has it over his &s;ervants: it is dimini&s;hed in our colleges; nay, in our grammar-&s;chools."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"What is the cau&s;e of this, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why the coming in of the Scotch."</Q> (laughing &s;arca&s;tically). BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"That is to &s;ay, things have been turned top&s;y turvey.&mdash;But your &s;erious cau&s;e."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, there are many cau&s;es, the chief of which is, I think, the great increa&s;e of money. No man now depends upon the Lord of a Manour, when he can &s;end to another country, and fetch provi&s;ions. The &s;hoe-black at the entry of my court does not depend on me. I can deprive him but of a penny a day, which he hopes &s;omebody el&s;e will bring him; and that penny I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> carry to another &s;hoe-black, &s;o the trade &s;uffers nothing. I have explained,
<PB N="210" REF="212" MS="y">
 in my 'Journey to the Hebrides,' how gold and &s;ilver de&s;troy &s;edual &s;ubordi|nation. But, be&s;ides, there is a general relaxation of reverence. No &s;on now depends upon his father as in former times. Paternity u&s;ed to be con|&s;idered as of it&s;elf a great thing, which had a right to many claims. That is, in general, reduced to very &s;mall bounds. My hope is, that as anarchy produces tyranny, this extreme relaxation will produce <HI>freni &s;trictio.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Talking of fame, for which there is &s;o great a de&s;ire, I ob&s;erved how little there is of it in reality, compared with the other objects of human attention. <Q REND="inline">"Let every man recollect, and he will be &s;en&s;ible how &s;mall a part of his time is employed in talking or thinking of Shak&s;peare, Voltaire, or any of the mo&s;t celebrated men that have ever lived, or are now &s;uppo&s;ed to occupy the attention and admiration of the world. Let this be extracted and com|pre&s;&s;ed; into what a narrow &s;pace will it go!"</Q> I then &s;lily introduced Mr. Garrick's fame, and his a&s;&s;uming the airs of a great man. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is wonderful how <HI>little</HI> Garrick a&s;&s;umes. No, Sir, Garrick <HI>fortunam reverenter habet.</HI> Con&s;ider, Sir: celebrated men, &s;uch as you have mentioned, have had their applau&s;e at a di&s;tance; but Garrick had it da&s;hed in his face, founded in his ears, and went home every night with the plaudits of a thou&s;and in his <HI>cranium.</HI> Then, Sir, Garrick did not <HI>find,</HI> but <HI>made</HI> his way to the tables, the levees, and almo&s;t the bed-chambers, of the great. Then, Sir, Garrick had under him a numerous body of people; who, from fear of his power, and hopes of his favour, and admiration of his talents, were con&s;tantly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to him. And here is a man who has advanced the dignity of his profe&s;&s;ion. Garrick has made a player a higher character."</Q> SCOTT. <Q REND="inline">"And he is a very &s;prightly writer too."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; and all this &s;upported by great wealth of his own acqui&s;ition. If all this had happened to me, I &s;hould have had a couple of fellows with long poles walk|ing before me, to knock down every body that &s;tood in the way. Con|&s;ider, if all this had happened to Cibber or Quin, they'd have jumped over the moon.&mdash;Yet Garrick &s;peaks to <HI>us.</HI>"</Q> (&s;miling). BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"And Garrick is a very good man, a charitable man."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, a liberal man. He has given away more money than any man in England. There may be a little vanity mixed: but he has &s;hewn, that money is not his fir&s;t object."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Yet Foote u&s;ed to &s;ay of him, that he walked out with an intention to do a generous action; but, turning the corner of a &s;treet, he met with the gho&s;t of a halfpenny, which frightened him."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, that is very true, too; for I never knew a man of whom it could be &s;aid with le&s;s certainty to-day, what he will do to-morrow, than Garrick; it depends
<PB N="211" REF="213" MS="y">
&s;o much on his humour at the time."</Q> SCOTT. <Q REND="inline">"I am glad to hear of his  liberality. He has been repre&s;ented as very &s;aving."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"With his dome&s;tick &s;aving we have nothing to do. I remember drinking tea with him long ago, when Peg Woffington made it, and he grumbled at her for making it too &s;trong <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">When John&s;on told this little anecdote to Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, he mentioned a cir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">um&s;tance which he omitted to-day:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why (&s;aid Garrick) it is as red as blood."</Q></NOTE>. He had then begun to feel money in his pur&s;e, and did not know when he &s;hould have enough of it."</Q></P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of wealth, the proper u&s;e of it, and the effects of that art which is called oeconomy, he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"It is wonderful to think how men of very large e&s;tates not only &s;pend their yearly income, but are often actually in want of money. It is clear, they have not value for what they &s;pend. Lord Shelburne told me, that a man of high rank, who looks into his own affairs, may have all that he ought to have, all that can be of any u&s;e, or appear with any advantage, for five thou&s;and pounds a year. There|fore, a great proportion mu&s;t go in wa&s;te; and, indeed, this is the ca&s;e with mo&s;t people, whatever their fortune is."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I have no doubt, Sir, of this. But how is it? What is wa&s;te?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, break|ing bottles, and a thou&s;and other things. Wa&s;te cannot be accurately told, though we are &s;en&s;ible how de&s;tructive it is. Oeconomy on the one hand, by which a certain income is made to maintain a man genteelly, and wa&s;te on the other, by which, on the &s;ame income, another man lives &s;habbily, cannot be defined. It is a very nice thing: as one man wears his coat out much &s;ooner than another, we cannot tell how."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of war. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Every man thinks meanly of him&s;elf for not having been a &s;oldier, or not having been at &s;ea."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Lord Mansfield does not."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if Lord Mansfield were in a com|pany of General Officers and Admirals who have been in &s;ervice, he would &s;hrink; he'd wi&s;h to creep under the table."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"No; he'd think he could <HI>try</HI> them all."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, if he could catch them: but they'd try him much &s;ooner. No, Sir; were Socrates and Charles the Twelfth of Sweden both pre&s;ent in any company, and Socrates to &s;ay, 'Follow me, and hear a lecture in philo&s;ophy;' and Charles, laying his hand on his &s;word, to &s;ay, 'Follow me, and dethrone the Czar;' a man would be a&s;hamed to follow Socrates. Sir, the impre&s;&s;ion is univer&s;al: yet it is &s;trange. As to the &s;ailor, when you look down from the quarter-deck to the &s;pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e below, you &s;ee the utmo&s;t extremity of human mi&s;ery: &s;uch crouding, &s;uch filth, &s;uch &s;tench!"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Yet &s;ailors are happy."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"They
<PB N="212" REF="214" MS="y">
 are happy as brutes are happy, with a piece of fre&s;h meat, with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;en&s;uality. But, Sir, the profe&s;&s;ion of &s;oldiers and &s;ailors has the dignity of danger. Mankind reverence tho&s;e who have got over fear, which is &s;o general a weakne&s;s."</Q> SCOTT. <Q REND="inline">"But is not courage mechanical, and to be acquired?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, Sir, in a collective &s;en&s;e. Soldiers con&s;ider them&s;elves only as parts of a great machine."</Q> SCOTT. <Q REND="inline">"We find people fond of being &s;ailors."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I cannot account for that, any more than I can account for other &s;trange perver&s;ions of imagination."</Q></P>
<P>His abhorrence of the profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;ailor was uniformly violent; but in conver&s;ation he always exalted the profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;oldier. And yet I have, in my large and various collection of his writings, a letter to an eminent friend, in which he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus: <Q REND="inline">"My god-&s;on called on me lately. He is weary, and rationally weary, of a military life. If you can place him in &s;ome other &s;tate, I think you may increa&s;e his happine&s;s, and &s;ecure his virtue. A &s;oldier's time is pa&s;&s;ed in di&s;tre&s;s and danger, or in idle|ne&s;s and corruption."</Q> Such was his cool reflection in his &s;tudy; but when|ever he was warmed and animated by the pre&s;ence of company, he, like other philo&s;ophers, who&s;e minds are impregnated with poetical fancy, caught the common enthu&s;ia&s;m for &s;plendid renown.</P>
<P>He talked of Mr. Charles Fox, of who&s;e abilities he thought highly, but ob&s;erved, that he did not talk much at our club. I have heard Mr. Gibbon re|mark, <Q REND="inline">"that Mr. Fox could not be afraid of Dr. John&s;on; yet he certainly was very &s;hy of &s;aying any thing in Dr. John&s;on's pre&s;ence."</Q> Mr. Scott now quoted what was &s;aid of Alcibiades by a Greek poet, to which John&s;on a&s;&s;ented.</P>
<P>He told us, that he had given Mrs. Montagu a catalogue of all Daniel Defoe's works of imagination; mo&s;t, if not all of which, as well as of his other works, he now enumerated, allowing a con&s;iderable &s;hare of merit to a man, who, bred a &s;ilver&s;mith, had written &s;o variou&s;ly and &s;o well. Indeed, his <Q REND="inline">"Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe"</Q> is enough of it&s;elf to e&s;tabli&s;h his reputation.</P>
<P>He expre&s;&s;ed great indignation at the impo&s;ture of the Cock-lane Gho&s;t, and related, with much &s;atisfaction, how he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in detecting the cheat, and had publi&s;hed an account of it in the new&s;papers. Upon this &s;ubject I incautiou&s;ly offended him, by pre&s;&s;ing him with too many que&s;tions, and he &s;hewed his di&s;plea&s;ure. I apologi&s;ed, &s;aying that <Q REND="inline">"I a&s;ked que&s;tions in order to be in&s;tructed and entertained; I repaired eagerly to the fountain; but that the moment he gave me a hint, the moment he put a lock upon the well, I de&s;i&s;ted."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, (&s;aid he,) that is forcing one to do a di&s;agreeable thing:"</Q> and he continued to rate me. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, (&s;aid I,) when you have
<PB N="213" REF="215" MS="y">
put a lock upon the well, &s;o that I can no longer drink, do not make the  fountain of your wit play upon me and wet me."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;ometimes could not bear being teazed with que&s;tions. I was once pre&s;ent when a gentleman a&s;ked &s;o many, as, <Q TYPE="inline, marginal quotes">"What did you do, Sir? What did you &s;ay, Sir?"</Q> that he at la&s;t grew enraged, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I will not be put to the <HI>que&s;tion.</HI> Don't you con&s;ider, Sir, that the&s;e are not the manners of a gentleman? I will not be baited with <HI>what,</HI> and <HI>why;</HI> what is this? what is that? why is a cow's tail long? why is a fox's tail bu&s;hy?"</Q> The gentleman, who was a good deal out of countenance, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, you are &s;o good, that I venture to trouble you."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, my being &s;o <HI>good</HI> is no rea&s;on why you &s;hould be &s;o <HI>ill.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Talking of the Ju&s;titia hulk at Woolwich, in which criminals were puni&s;hed, by being confined to labour, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I do not &s;ee that they are puni&s;hed by this: they mu&s;t have worked equally had they never been guilty of &s;tealing. They now only work; &s;o, after all, they have gained; what they &s;tole is clear gain to them; the confinement is nothing. Every man who works is confined: the &s;mith to his &s;hop, the tailor to his garret."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"And Lord Mansfield to his Court."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir. You know the notion of confinement may be extended, as in the &s;ong, 'Every i&s;land is a pri&s;on.' There is, in Dod&s;ley's collection, a copy of ver&s;es to the authour of that &s;ong."</Q></P>
<P>Smith's Latin ver&s;es on Pococke, the great traveller, were mentioned. He repeated &s;ome of them, and &s;aid they were Smith's be&s;t ver&s;es.</P>
<P>He talked with an uncommon animation of travelling into di&s;tant countries; that the mind was enlarged by it, and that an acqui&s;ition of dignity of character was derived from it. He expre&s;&s;ed a particular enthu&s;ia&s;m with re&s;pect to vi&s;iting the wall of China. I catched it for the moment, and &s;aid I really believed I &s;hould go and &s;ee the wall of China had I not children, of whom it was my duty to take care. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) by doing &s;o, you would do what would be of importance in rai&s;ing your children to eminence. There would be a lu&s;tre reflected upon them from your &s;pirit and curio&s;ity. They would be at all times regarded as the children of a man who had gone to view the wall of China. I am &s;erious, Sir."</Q></P>
<P>When we had left Mr. Scott's, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Will you go home with me?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid I&punc;) it is late; but I'll go with you for three minutes."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Or <HI>four.</HI>"</Q> We went to Mrs. Williams's room, where we found Mr. Allen the printer, who was the landlord of his hou&s;e in Bolt-court, a worthy obliging man, and his very old acquaintance; and what was exceedingly
<PB N="214" REF="216" MS="y">
 amu&s;ing, though he was of a very diminutive &s;ize, he u&s;ed, even in John&s;on's pre&s;ence, to imitate the &s;tately periods and &s;low and &s;olemn utterance of the great man. I this evening boa&s;ted, that although I did not write what is called &s;tenography, or &s;hort-hand, in appropriated characters devi&s;ed for the purpo&s;e, I had a method of my own of writing half words, and leaving out &s;ome altogether, &s;o as yet to keep the &s;ub&s;tance and language of any di&s;cour&s;e which I heard &s;o much in view, that I could give it very completely &s;oon after taking it down. He defied me, as he had once defied an actual &s;hort-hand writer; and he made the experiment by reading &s;lowly and di&s;tinctly a part of Robert&s;on's <Q REND="inline">"Hi&s;tory of America,"</Q> while I endeavoured to write it in my way of taking notes. It was found that I had it very imperfectly; the con|clu&s;ion from which was, that its excellence was principally owing to a &s;tudied arrangement of words, which could not be varied or abridged without an e&s;&s;ential injury.</P>
<P>On Sunday, April 12, I found him at home before dinner; Dr. Dodd's poem entitled <Q REND="inline">"Thoughts in Pri&s;on,"</Q> was lying upon his table. This appearing to me an extraordinary effort by a man who was in Newgate for a capital crime, I was de&s;irous to hear John&s;on's opinion of it: to my &s;urprize, he told me he had not read a line of it. I took up the book and read a pa&s;&s;age to him. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Pretty well, if you are previou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed to like them."</Q> I read another pa&s;&s;age, with which he was better plea&s;ed. He then took the book into his own hands, and having looked at the prayer at the end of it, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"What <HI>evidence</HI> is there that this was compo&s;ed the night before he &s;uffered. <HI>I</HI> do not believe it."</Q> He then read aloud where he prays for the King, &amp;c. and ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, do you think that a man the night before he is to be hanged cares for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of a royal family? Though he <HI>may</HI> have compo&s;ed this prayer then. A man who has been canting all his life may cant to the la&s;t. And yet a man who has been refu&s;ed a pardon after &s;o much petitioning, would hardly be praying thus &s;ervently for the King."</Q></P>
<P>He and I, and Mrs. Williams, went to dine with the Reverend Dr. Percy. Talking of Gold&s;mith, John&s;on &s;aid, he was very envious. I defended him, by ob&s;erving that he owned it frankly upon all occa&s;ions. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you are enforcing the charge. He had &s;o much envy that he could not conceal it. He was &s;o full of it that he overflowed. He talked of it to be &s;ure often enough. Now, Sir, what a man avows, he is not a&s;hamed to think; though many a man thinks, what he is a&s;hamed to avow. We are all envious naturally; but by checking envy we get the better of it. So we are all
<PB N="215" REF="217" MS="y">
thieves naturally; a child always tries to get at what it wants, the neare&s;t  way; by good in&s;truction and good habits this is cured, till a man has not even an inclination to &s;eize what is another's; has no &s;truggle with him&s;elf about it."</Q></P>
<P>And here I &s;hall record a &s;cene of too much heat between Dr. John&s;on and Dr. Percy, which I &s;hould have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, were it not that it gave occa&s;ion to di&s;play the truely tender and benevolent heart of John&s;on, who as &s;oon as he found a friend was at all hurt by any thing which he had <Q REND="inline">"&s;aid in his wrath,"</Q> was not only prompt and de&s;irous to be reconciled, but exerted him|&s;elf to make ample reparation.</P>
<P>Books of Travels having been mentioned, John&s;on prai&s;ed Pennant very highly, as he did at Dunvegan, in the I&s;le of Sky <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</Q> edit. 3. p. 221.</NOTE>. Dr. Percy &s;till holding him&s;elf as the heir male of the ancient Percies, and having the warme&s;t and mo&s;t dutiful attachment to the noble hou&s;e of Northumberland, could not &s;it quietly and hear a man prai&s;ed, who had &s;poken di&s;re&s;pectfully of Alnwick-Ca&s;tle and the Duke's plea&s;ure-grounds, e&s;pecially as he thought meanly of his travels. He therefore oppo&s;ed John&s;on eagerly. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Pennant in what he has &s;aid of Alnwick, has done what he intended; he has made you very angry."</Q> PERCY. <Q REND="inline">"He has &s;aid the garden is <HI>trim,</HI> which is repre|&s;enting it like a citizen's parterre, when the truth is, there is a very large extent of fine turf and gravel walks."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"According to your own account, Sir, Pennant is right. It <HI>is</HI> trim. Here is gra&s;s cut clo&s;e, and gravel rolled &s;mooth. Is not that trim? The extent is nothing again&s;t that; a mile may be as trim as a &s;quare yard. Your extent puts me in mind of the citizens' enlarged dinner, two pieces of roa&s;t-beef, and two puddings. There is no variety, no mind exerted in laying out the ground, no trees."</Q> PERCY. <Q REND="inline">"He pretends to give the natural hi&s;tory of Northumberland, and yet takes no notice of the immen&s;e number of trees planted there of late."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"That, Sir, has nothing to do with the <HI>natural</HI> hi&s;tory; that is <HI>civil</HI> hi&s;tory. A man who gives the natural hi&s;tory of the oak, is not to tell how many oaks have been planted in this place or that. A man who gives the natural hi&s;tory of the cow, is not to tell how many cows are milked at I&s;lington. The animal is the &s;ame, whether milked in the Park or at I&s;lington."</Q> PERCY. <Q REND="inline">"Pennant does not de&s;cribe well; a carrier who goes along the &s;ide of Lochlomond would de&s;cribe it better."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I think he de&s;cribes very well."</Q> PERCY. <Q REND="inline">"I travelled after him."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"And I travelled
<PB N="216" REF="218" MS="y">
 after him."</Q> PERCY. <Q REND="inline">"But, my good friend, you are &s;hort-&s;ighted, and do not &s;ee &s;o well as I do."</Q> I wondered at Dr. Percy's venturing thus. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid nothing at the time; but inflammable particles were collecting for a cloud to bur&s;t. In a little while Dr. Percy &s;aid &s;omething more in di&s;paragement of Pennant. JOHNSON. (pointedly) <Q REND="inline">"This is the re&s;entment of a narrow mind, becau&s;e he did not find every thing in Northumberland."</Q> PERCY. (feeling the &s;troke) <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you may be as rude as you plea&s;e."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Hold, Sir! Don't talk of rudene&s;s; remember, Sir, you told me (puffing hard with pa&s;&s;ion &s;truggling for a vent) I was &s;hort-&s;ighted. We have done with civility. We are to be as rude as we plea&s;e."</Q> PERCY. <Q REND="inline">"Upon my honour, Sir, I did not mean to be uncivil."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I can|not &s;ay &s;o, Sir; for I <HI>did</HI> mean to be uncivil, thinking <HI>you</HI> had been uncivil."</Q> Dr. Percy ro&s;e, ran up to him, and taking him by the hand, a&s;&s;ured him affectionately that his meaning had been mi&s;under&s;tood; upon which a recon|ciliation in&s;tantly took place. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir, I am willing you &s;hall <HI>hang</HI> Pennant."</Q> PERCY. (re&s;uming the former &s;ubject) <Q REND="inline">"Pennant complains that the helmet is not hung out to invite to the hall of ho&s;pitality. Now I never heard that it was a cu&s;tom to hand out a <HI>helmet.</HI>"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Hang him up, hang him up."</Q> BOSWELL. (humouring the joke) <Q REND="inline">"Hang out his &s;kull in&s;tead of a helmet, and you may drink ale out of it in your hall of Odin, as he is your enemy; that will be truly ancient. <HI>There</HI> will be 'Northern Antiquities."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"He's a <HI>Whig,</HI> Sir; a <HI>&s;ad dog</HI> (&s;miling at his own violent expre&s;&s;ions, merely for <HI>political</HI> difference of opinion). But he's the be&s;t traveller I ever read; he ob&s;erves more things than any one el&s;e does."</Q></P>
<P>I could not help thinking that this was too high prai&s;e of a writer who traver&s;ed a wide extent of country in &s;uch ha&s;te, that he could put together only curt frittered fragments of his own, and afterwards procured &s;upplemental intelligence from parochial mini&s;ters, and others not the be&s;t qualified or mo&s;t impartial narrators, who&s;e ungenerous prejudice again&s;t the hou&s;e of Stuart glares in mi&s;repre&s;entation; a writer, who at be&s;t treats merely of &s;uperficial objects, and &s;hews no philo&s;ophical inve&s;tigation of character and manners, &s;uch as John&s;on has exhibited in his ma&s;terly <Q REND="inline">"Journey,"</Q> over part of the &s;ame ground; and who it &s;hould &s;eem from a de&s;ire of ingratiating him&s;elf with the Scotch, has flattered the people of North-Britain &s;o inordinately and with &s;o little di&s;crimination, that the judicious and candid among&s;t them mu&s;t be di&s;gu&s;ted, while they value more the plain, ju&s;t, yet kindly report of John&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="219" MS="y">
We had a calm after the &s;torm, &s;taid the evening and &s;upt, and were  plea&s;ant and gay. But Dr. Percy told me he was very unea&s;y at what had pa&s;&s;ed; for there was a gentleman there who had recently been admitted into the confidence of the Northumberland family, to whom he hoped to appear more re&s;pectable, by &s;hewing him how intimate he was with the great Dr. John&s;on; and now the gentleman would go away with an impre&s;&s;ion much to his di&s;advantage, as if John&s;on treated him with di&s;regard, which might do him an e&s;&s;ential injury. He begged I would mention this to Dr. John&s;on, which I afterwards did. His ob&s;ervation upon it was, <Q REND="inline">"This comes of <HI>&s;tratagem;</HI> had he tole me that he wi&s;hed to appear to advantage before that gentleman, he &s;hould have been at the top of the hou&s;e all the time."</Q> He &s;poke of Dr. Percy in the hand&s;ome&s;t terms. <Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, (&s;aid I,) may I be allowed to &s;ugge&s;t a mode by which you may effectually counteract any unfavourable report of what pa&s;&s;ed. I will write a letter to you upon the &s;ubject of the unlucky conte&s;t of that day, and you will be kind enough to put in writing as an an&s;wer to that letter, what you have now &s;aid, and in &s;hort all that you can &s;ay to Dr. Percy's advantage; and as Lord Percy is to dine with us at General Paoli's &s;oon, I will take an oppor|tunity to read the corre&s;pondence in his Lord&s;hip's pre&s;ence.</Q> This friendly &s;cheme was accordingly carried into execution without Dr. Percy's know|ledge. John&s;on's letter was &s;tudiou&s;ly framed to place Dr. Percy's un|que&s;tionable merit in the faire&s;t point of view; and I contrived that Lord Percy &s;hould hear the corre&s;pondence, by introducing it at General Paoli's, as an in&s;tance of Dr. John&s;on's kind di&s;po&s;ition towards one in whom his Lord&s;hip was intere&s;ted. Thus our friend Percy was rai&s;ed higher in the e&s;timation of tho&s;e by whom he wi&s;hed mo&s;t to be regarded. I breakfa&s;ted the day after with him, and informed him of my &s;cheme, and its happy completion, for which he thanked me in the warme&s;t terms, and was highly delighted with Dr. John&s;on's letter in his prai&s;e, of which I gave him a copy. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I would rather have this than degrees from all the Univer&s;ities in Europe. It will be for me, and my children and grand-children."</Q> Dr. John&s;on having afterwards a&s;ked me if I had given him a copy of it, and being told I had, was offended, and in&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould get it back, which I did. As, however, he did not de&s;ire me to de&s;troy either the original or the copy, or forbid me to let it be &s;een, I think my&s;elf at liberty to apply to it his general declaration to me concerning his other letters, <Q REND="inline">"That he did not choo&s;e they &s;hould be publi&s;hed in his life-time; but had no objection to their appearing after his death."</Q> I &s;hall therefore

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE debate between Dr. Percy and me is one of tho&s;e fooli&s;h controver&s;ies, which begin upon a que&s;tion of which neither party cares how it is decided, and which is, neverthele&s;s, continued to acrimony, by the vanity with which every man re&s;i&s;ts confutation. Dr. Percy's warmth pro|ceeded from a cau&s;e which, perhaps, does him more honour than he could
<PB N="219" REF="221">
have derived from ju&s;ter critici&s;m. His abhorrence of Pennant proceeded  from his opinion that Pennant had wantonly and indecently cen&s;ured his patron. His anger made him re&s;olve that for having been once wrong, he never &s;hould be right. Pennant has much in his notions that I do not like; but &s;till I think him a very intelligent traveller. If Percy is really offended, I am &s;orry; for he is a man whom I never knew to offend any one. He is a man very willing to learn, and very able to teach; a man, out of who&s;e company I never go without having learned &s;omething. It is &s;ure that he vexes me &s;ometimes, but I am afraid it is by making me feel my own igno|rance. So much exten&s;ion of mind, and &s;o much minute accuracy of enquiry, if you &s;urvey your whole circle of acquaintance, you will find &s;o &s;carce, if you find it at all, that you will value Percy by compari&s;on. Lord Hailes is &s;omewhat like him: but Lord Hailes does not, perhaps, go beyond him in re&s;earch; and I do not know that he equals him in elegance. Percy's attention to poetry has given grace and &s;plendour to his &s;tudies of antiquity. A mere antiquarian is a rugged being.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, you &s;ee that what I might &s;ay in &s;port or petulance to him, is very con&s;i&s;tent with full conviction of his merit.</P>

<P>On Monday, April 13, I dined with John&s;on at Mr. Langton's, where were Dr. Porteus, then Bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, now of London, and Dr. Stinton. He

<P>At dinner we talked of another mode in the news-papers of giving modern characters in &s;entences from the cla&s;&s;icks, and of the pa&s;&s;age</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>being well applied to Soame Jennyns; who, after having wandered in the wilds of infidelity, had returned to the Chri&s;tian faith. Mr. Langton a&s;ked John&s;on as to the propriety of <HI>&s;apientiae con&s;ultus.</HI> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Though <HI>con&s;ultus</HI> was primarily an adjective, like <HI>amicus</HI> it came to be u&s;ed as a &s;ub&s;tantive. So we have <HI>Juris-con&s;ultus,</HI> a con&s;ult in law."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of the &s;tyles of different painters, and how certainly a con|noi&s;&s;eur could di&s;tingui&s;h them. I a&s;ked if there was as clear a difference of &s;tyles in language as in painting, or even as in hand-writing, &s;o that the com|po&s;ition of every individual may be di&s;tingui&s;hed? JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes. Tho&s;e who have a &s;tyle of eminent excellence, &s;uch as Dryden and Milton, can always be di&s;tingui&s;hed."</Q> I had no doubt of this; but what I wanted to know was, whether there was really a peculiar &s;tyle to every man what|ever, as there is certainly a peculiar hand-writing, a peculiar countenance, not widely different in many, yet always enough to be di&s;tinctive:
<Q><L>"&mdash;Facies non omnibus una</L>
<L>"Nec diver&s;a tamen."&mdash;</L></Q>
The Bi&s;hop thought not; and &s;aid, he &s;uppo&s;ed that many pieces in Dod&s;ley's collection of poems, though all very pretty, had nothing appropriated in their &s;tyle, and in that particular could not be at all di&s;tingui&s;hed. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I think every man whatever has a peculiar &s;tyle, which may be

di&s;covered by nice examination and compari&s;on with others: but a man mu&s;t  write a great deal to make his &s;tyle obviou&s;ly di&s;cernable. As logicians &s;ay, this appropriation of &s;tyle is infinite <HI>in pote&s;tate,</HI> limited <HI>in actu.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Topham Beauclerk came in the evening, and he and Dr. John&s;on and I &s;taid to &s;upper. It was mentioned that Dr. Dodd had once wi&s;hed to be a member of THE LITERARY CLUB.

(&s;uppo&s;ing this to be aimed at per&s;ons for whom he had at that time a wonderful fancy, which, however, did not la&s;t long,) was irritated, and eagerly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You, Sir, have a friend (naming him) who de&s;erves to be hanged; for he &s;peaks behind their backs again&s;t tho&s;e with whom he lives on the be&s;t terms, and attacks them in the news-papers. <HI>He</HI> certainly ought to be <HI>kicked.</HI>"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, we all do this in &s;ome degree, <HI>'Veniam petimus damu&s;que vici&s;&s;im.'</HI> To be &s;ure it may be done &s;o much that a man may de&s;erve to be kicked."</Q> BEAUCLERK. <Q REND="inline">"He is very malignant."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; he is not malignant. He is mi&s;chievous, if you will. He would do no man an e&s;&s;ential injury; he may, indeed, love to make &s;port of people by vexing their vanity. I, however, once knew an old gentleman who was ab&s;olutely malignant. He really wi&s;hed evil to others, and rejoiced at it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"The gentleman, Mr. Beauclerk, again&s;t whom you are &s;o violent, is I know, a man of good principles."</Q> BEAUCLERK. <Q REND="inline">"Then he does not wear them out in practice."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on, who as I have ob&s;erved before, delighted in di&s;crimination of character, and having a ma&s;terly knowledge of human nature, was willing to take men as they are, imperfect and with a mixture of good and bad qualities, I &s;uppo&s;e thought he had &s;aid enough in defence of his friend; of who&s;e merits, notwith&s;tanding his exceptionable points, he had a ju&s;t value, and added no more on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, April 14, I dined with him at General Oglethorpe's, with General Paoli and Mr. Langton. General Oglethorpe declaimed again&s;t luxury.

Let us us have <HI>that</HI> kind of luxury, Sir, if you will."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But hold, Sir; to be merely &s;atisfied is not enough. It is in refinement and elegance that the civilized man differs from the &s;avage. A great part of our indu&s;try, and all our ingenuity is exerci&s;ed in procuring plea&s;ure; and, Sir, a hungry man has not the &s;ame plea&s;ure in eating a plain dinner, that a hungry man has in eating a luxurious dinner. You &s;ee I put the ca&s;e fairly. A hungry man may have as much, nay, more plea&s;ure in eating a plain dinner, than a man grown fa&s;tidious has in eating a luxurious dinner. But I &s;uppo&s;e the man who decides between the two dinners, to be equally a hungry man."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of different governments. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"The more contracted that power is, the more ea&s;ily it is de&s;troyed. A country governed by a de&s;pot is an inverted cone. Government there cannot be &s;o firm as when it re&s;ts upon a broad ba&s;is gradually contracted, as the government of Great-Britain, which is founded on the parliament, then is in the privy-council, then in the King."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Power when contracted into the per&s;on of a de&s;pot may be ea&s;ily de&s;troyed, as the prince may be cut off.

<P>Dr. John&s;on endeavoured to trace the etymology of Maccaronick ver&s;es, which he thought were of Italian invention from Maccaroni; but on being in|formed that this would infer that they were the mo&s;t common and ea&s;y ver&s;es, maccaroni being the mo&s;t ordinary and &s;imple food, he was at a lo&s;s; for he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He rather &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed it to import in its primitive &s;ignification, a compo&s;ition of &s;everal things; for Maccaronick ver&s;es are ver&s;es made out of a mixture of different languages, that is, of one language with the termination of another."</Q> I &s;uppo&s;e there is almo&s;t no language in any country where there is any learning, in which that motley ludicrous &s;pecious of
<PB N="223" REF="225" MS="y">

The  <Q REND="inline">"Polemomiddinia"</Q> of Drummond of Hawthornden, in which there is a jumble of many languages moulded, as if it were, all in Latin, is well known. Mr. Langton made us laugh heartily at one in the Grecian mould, by Jo&s;hua Barnes, in which are to be found &s;uch comical <HI>Anglo-Elleni&s;ms</HI> as <GAP DESC="foreign">. They were banged with clubs.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, April 15, I dined with Dr. John&s;on at Mr. Dilly's, and was in high &s;pirits, for I had been a good part of the morning with Mr. Orme, the able and eloquent hi&s;torian of Hindo&s;tan, who expre&s;&s;ed a high admiration of John&s;on. <Q REND="inline">"I do not care (&s;aid he,) on what &s;ubject John&s;on talks; but I love better to hear him talk than any body. He either gives you new thoughts, or a new colouring. It is a &s;hame to the nation that he has not been more liberally rewarded. Had I been George the Third, and thought as he did about America, I would have given John&s;on three hundred a year for his 'Taxation no Tyranny' alone."</Q> I repeated this, and John&s;on was much plea&s;ed with &s;uch prai&s;e from &s;uch a man as Orme.</P>
<P>At Mr. Dilly's to-day were Mrs. Knowles, the ingenious Quaker lady <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Dr. John&s;on, de&s;cribing her needle-work in one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale, Vol. I. p. 326, u&s;es the learned word <HI>&s;utile;</HI> which Mrs. Thrale has mi&s;taken, and made the phra&s;e injurious by writing <Q REND="inline">"<HI>futile</HI> pictures."</Q></NOTE>, Mi&s;s Seward, the poete&s;s of Lichfield, the Rev. Dr. Mayo, and the Rev. Mr. Beresford, Tutor to the Duke of Bedford. Before dinner Dr. John&s;on &s;eized upon Mr. Charles Sheridan's <Q REND="inline">"Account of the late Revolution in Sweden,"</Q> and &s;eemed to read it ravenou&s;ly as if he devoured it, which was to all appearance his method of &s;tudying. <Q REND="inline">"He knows how to read better than any one (&s;aid Mrs. Knowles); he gets at the &s;ub&s;tance of a book directly; he tears out the heart of it."</Q> He kept it wrapt up in the table|cloth in his lap during the time of dinner, from an avidity to have one enter|tainment in readine&s;s when he &s;hould have fini&s;hed another, re&s;embling (if I may u&s;e &s;o coar&s;e a &s;imile) a dog who holds a bone in his paws in re&s;erve, while he eats &s;omething el&s;e which has been thrown to him.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of cookery having been very naturally introduced at a table where John&s;on, who boa&s;ted of the nicene&s;s of his palate, owned that <Q REND="inline">"he always found a good dinner,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I could write a better book of cookery than has ever yet been written; it &s;hould be a book upon philo&s;o|phical principles.

<P>JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"O! Mr. Dilly&mdash;you mu&s;t know that an Engli&s;h Benedictine Monk at Paris has tran&s;lated 'The Duke of Berwick's Memoirs,' from the original French, and has &s;ent them to me to &s;ell. I offered them to Strahan, who &s;ent them back with this an&s;wer:&mdash;'That the fir&s;t book he had publi&s;hed was the Duke of Berwick's Life, by which he had lo&s;t; and he hated the name.'&mdash;Now I hone&s;tly tell you, that Strahan has refu&s;ed them; but I al&s;o hone&s;tly tell you, that he did it upon no principle, for he never looked into them."</Q> DILLY. <Q REND="inline">"Are they well tran&s;lated, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, very well&mdash;in a &s;tyle very current and very clear. I have written to the Bene|dictine to give me an an&s;wer upon two points&mdash;What evidence is there that the letters are authentick? For if they are not authentick they are nothing.&mdash;And how long will it be before the original French is publi&s;hed? For if the French edition is not to appear for a con&s;iderable time, the tran&s;lation will be almo&s;t as valuable as an original book. They will make two volumes in octavo; and I have undertaken to correct every &s;heet as it comes from the pre&s;s."</Q> Mr. Dilly de&s;ired to &s;ee them, and &s;aid he would &s;end for them.

Mrs. Knowles affected to complain that men had much more liberty  allowed them than women. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Madam, women have all the liberty they &s;hould wi&s;h to have. We have all the labour and the danger, and the women all the advantage. We go to &s;ea, we build hou&s;es, we do every thing, in &s;hort, to pay our court to the women."</Q> MRS. KNOWLES. <Q REND="inline">"The Doctor rea&s;ons very wittily, but not convincingly. Now, take the in&s;tance of building; the ma&s;on's wife, if &s;he is ever &s;een in liquor, is ruined. The ma&s;on may get him&s;elf drunk as often as he plea&s;es, with little lo&s;s of character; nay, may let his wife and children &s;tarve."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Madam, you mu&s;t con&s;ider, if the ma&s;on does get him&s;elf drunk, and let his wife and children &s;tarve, the pari&s;h will oblige him to find &s;ecurity for their maintenance. We have different modes of re&s;training evil. Stocks for the men, a ducking-&s;tool for women, and a pound for bea&s;ts. If we require more perfection from women than from our&s;elves, it is doing them honour. And women have not the &s;ame temptations that we have: they may always live in virtuous company; men mu&s;t mix in the world indi&s;criminately. If a woman has no inclination to do what is wrong, being &s;ecured from it is no re&s;traint to her. I am at liberty to walk into the Thames; but if I were to try it, my friends would re&s;train me in Bedlam, and I &s;hould be obliged to them."</Q> MRS. KNOWLES. <Q REND="inline">"Still, Doctor, I cannot help thinking it a hard&s;hip that more indulgence is allowed to men than to women. It gives a &s;uperiority to men, to which I do not &s;ee how they are entitled."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It is plain, Madam, one or other mu&s;t have the &s;uperiority. As Shak&s;peare &s;ays, 'If two men ride on hor&s;eback, one mu&s;t ride behind."</Q> DILLY. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, Mrs. Knowles would have them to ride in panniers, one on each &s;ide."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, the hor&s;e would throw them both."</Q> MRS.

<P>Upon this &s;ubject I had once before &s;ounded him, by mentioning the late Reverend Mr. Brown, of Utrecht's image; that a great and &s;mall gla&s;s, though equally full, did not hold an equal quantity; which he threw out to refute David Hume's &s;aying, that a little mi&s;s, going to dance at a ball, in a

<P>Dr. Mayo having a&s;ked John&s;on's opinion of Soame Jennyns's <Q REND="inline">"View of the internal Evidence of the Chri&s;tian Religion;"</Q>&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I think it a pretty book; not very theological indeed; and there &s;eems to be an affectation of ea&s;e and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, as if it were not &s;uitable to his character to be very &s;erious about the matter."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"He may have intended this to intro|duce his book the better among genteel people, who might be unwilling to read too grave a treati&s;e.

I own, indeed, there may be more virtue in giving it immediately in charity than in &s;pending it in luxury; though there may be a pride in that too."</Q> Mi&s;s Seward a&s;ked if this was not Mandeville's doctrine of <Q REND="inline">"private vices publick benefits."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"The fallacy of that book is, that Mandeville defines neither vices nor benefits. He reckons among vices every thing that gives plea&s;ure. He takes the narrowe&s;t &s;y&s;tem of morality, mona&s;tick morality, which holds plea&s;ure it&s;elf to be a vice, &s;uch as eating &s;alt with our fi&s;h, becau&s;e it makes it ta&s;te better; and he reckons wealth as a publick benefit, which is by no means always true. Plea&s;ure of it&s;elf is not a vice. Having a garden, which we all know to be perfectly innocent, is a great plea&s;ure. At the &s;ame time, in this &s;tate of being there are many plea&s;ures vices, which however are &s;o immediately agreeable that we can hardly ab&s;tain from them. The happine&s;s of Heaven will be, that plea&s;ure and virtue will be perfectly con&s;i&s;tent. Mandeville puts the ca&s;e of a man who gets drunk at an alehou&s;e; and &s;ays it is a publick benefit, becau&s;e &s;o much money is got by it to the publick. But it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that all the good gained by this, through the gradation of alehou&s;e-keeper, brewer, malt&s;ter, and farmer, is overbalanced by the evil cau&s;ed to the man and his family by his getting drunk. This is the way to try what is vicious, by a&s;certaining whether more evil than good is produced by it upon the whole, which is the ca&s;e in all vice. It may happen that good is produced by vice; but not as vice; for in&s;tance, a robber may take money from its owner, and give it to one who will make a better u&s;e of it. Here is good produced; but not by the robbery as robbery, but as tran&s;lation of property. I read Mandeville forty, or I believe fifty years ago. He did not puzzle me; he opened my views into real life very much. No, it is clear that the happine&s;s of &s;ociety depends on virtue. In Sparta theft was allowed by general con&s;ent; theft, therefore, was <HI>there</HI> not a crime,
<PB N="289" REF="231" MS="y">
but then there was no &s;ecurity; and what a life mu&s;t they have had when  there was no &s;ecurity. Without truth there mu&s;t be a di&s;&s;olution of &s;ociety. As it is, there is &s;o little truth that we are almo&s;t afraid to tru&s;t our ears; but how &s;hould we be, if fal&s;ehood were multiplied ten times? Society is held together by communication and information; and I remember this remark of Sir Thomas Brown's, 'Do the devils lie? No; for then Hell could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t."</Q></P>

(&s;eeming to enjoy a plea&s;ing &s;erenity in the per&s;ua&s;ion of benignant divine light) <Q REND="inline">"Does not St. Paul &s;ay, 'I have fought the good fight of faith, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e; henceforth is laid up for me a crown of life'?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Madam; but here was a man in&s;pired, a man who had been converted by &s;upernatural interpo&s;ition."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"In pro&s;pect death is dreadful; but in fact we find that people die ea&s;y."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, mo&s;t people have not <HI>thought</HI> much of the matter, &s;o cannot <HI>&s;ay</HI> much, and it is &s;uppo&s;ed they die ea&s;y. Few believe it certain they are then to die; and tho&s;e who do, &s;et them&s;elves to behave with re&s;o|lution, as a man does who is going to be hanged. He is not the le&s;s unwil|ling to be hanged."</Q> MISS SEWARD. <Q REND="inline">"There is one mode of the fear of death, which is certainly ab&s;urd; and that is the dread of annihilation, which is only a plea&s;ing &s;leep without a dream."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It is neither plea&s;ing, nor &s;leep; it is nothing. Now mere exi&s;tence is &s;o much better than nothing, that one would rather exi&s;t even in pain, than not exi&s;t."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"If annihilation be nothing, then exi&s;ting in pain is not a comparative &s;tate, but is a po&s;itive evil, which I cannot think we &s;hould choo&s;e. I mu&s;t be allowed to differ here; and it would le&s;&s;en the hope of a future &s;tate founded on the argument, that the Supreme Being, who is good as he is great, will here|after compen&s;ate for our pre&s;ent &s;ufferings in this life. For if exi&s;tence, &s;uch as we have it here, be comparatively a good, we have no rea&s;on to com|plain, though no more of it &s;hould be given to us. But if our only &s;tate of exi&s;tence were in this world, then we might with &s;ome rea&s;on complain that we are &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied with our enjoyments compared with our de&s;ires."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"The lady confounds annihilation, which is nothing, with the appre|hen&s;ion of it, which is dreadful. It is in the apprehen&s;ion of it that the horrour of annihilation con&s;i&s;ts."</Q></P>

Of John We&s;ley he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He can talk well on any &s;ubject."</Q> BOSWELL.  <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, what has he made of his &s;tory of a gho&s;t?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, he believes it; but not on &s;ufficient authority. He did not take time enough to examine the girl. It was at Newca&s;tle, where the gho&s;t was &s;aid to have appeared to a young woman &s;everal times, mentioning &s;omething about the right to an old hou&s;e, advi&s;ing application to be made to an attorney, which was done; and, at the &s;ame time, &s;aying the attorney would do nothing, which proved to be the fact. 'This (&s;ays John) is a proof that a gho&s;t knows our thoughts.' Now (laughing) it is not nece&s;&s;ary to know our thoughts to tell that an attorney will &s;ometimes do nothing. Charles We&s;ley, who is a more &s;tationary man, does not believe the &s;tory. I am &s;orry that John did not take more pains to inquire into the evidence for it."</Q> MISS SEWARD. (with an incredulous &s;mile) <Q REND="inline">"What, Sir! about a gho&s;t?"</Q> JOHNSON. (with &s;olemn vehemence) <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Madam: this is a que&s;tion which, after five thou&s;and years, is yet undecided; a que&s;tion, whether in theology or philo&s;ophy, one of the mo&s;t important that can come before the human under&s;tanding."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Knowles mentioned, as a pro&s;elyte to Quakeri&s;m, Mi&s;s&mdash;, a young lady well known to Dr. John&s;on, for whom he had &s;hewn much affection; while &s;he ever had, and &s;till retained, a great re&s;pect for him. Mrs. Knowles at the &s;ame time took an opportunity of letting him know <Q REND="inline">"that the amiable young creature was &s;orry at finding that he was offended at her leaving the Church of England and embracing a &s;impler faith;"</Q> and, in the gentle&s;t and mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive manner, &s;olicited his kind indulgence for what was &s;incerely a matter of con&s;cience. JOHNSON. (frowning very angrily) <Q REND="inline">"Madam, &s;he is an odious wench. She could not have any proper conviction that it was her duty to change her religion, which is the mo&s;t important of all &s;ubjects, and &s;hould be &s;tudied with all care, and with all the helps we can get. She knew no more of the Church which &s;he left, and that which &s;he embraced, than &s;he did of the difference between the Copernican and Ptolemaick &s;y&s;tems."</Q> MRS. KNOWLES. <Q REND="inline">"She had the New Te&s;tament before her."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Madam, &s;he could not under&s;tand the New Te&s;tament, the mo&s;t difficult book in the world, for which the &s;tudy of a life is required."</Q> MRS. KNOWLES. <Q REND="inline">"It is clear as to e&s;&s;entials."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But not as to controver&s;ial points. The heathens were ea&s;ily converted, becau&s;e they had nothing to give up; but we ought not, without very &s;trong conviction indeed, to de&s;ert the religion in which we
<PB N="232" REF="234" MS="y">
 have been educated. That is the religion given you, the religion in which it may be &s;aid Providence has placed you. If you live con&s;cientiou&s;ly in that religion, you may be &s;afe. But errour is dangerous indeed, if you err when you choo&s;e a religion for your&s;elf."</Q> MRS. KNOWLES. <Q REND="inline">"Mu&s;t we then go by implicit faith?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Madam, the greate&s;t part of our knowledge is implicit faith; and as to religion, have we heard all that a di&s;ciple of Confucius, all that a Mahometan can &s;ay for him&s;elf?"</Q> He then ro&s;e again into pa&s;&s;ion, and attacked the young pro&s;elyte in the &s;evere&s;t terms of reproach, &s;o that both the ladies &s;eemed to be much &s;hocked.</P>
<P>We remained together till it was pretty late. Notwith&s;tanding occa&s;ional explo&s;ions of violence, we were all delighted upon the whole with John&s;on. I compared him at this time to a warm We&s;t-Indian climate, where you have a bright &s;un, quick vegetation, luxuriant foliage, lu&s;cious fruits; but where the &s;ame heat &s;ometimes produces thunder, lightening, and earthquakes in a terrible degree.</P>
<P>April 17, being Good-Friday, I waited on John&s;on as u&s;ual. I ob&s;erved at breakfa&s;t that although it was a part of his ab&s;temious di&s;cipline on this mo&s;t &s;olemn fa&s;t, to take no milk in his tea, yet when Mrs. De&s;moulins inadvertently poured it in, he did not reject it. I talked of the &s;trange indeci&s;ion of mind, and imbecillity in the common occurrences of life, which we may ob&s;erve in &s;ome people. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I am in the habit of getting others to do things for me."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"What, Sir! have you that weakne&s;s?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir. But I always think afterwards I &s;hould have done better for my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>I told him that at a gentleman's hou&s;e where there was thought to be &s;uch extravagance or bad management, that he was living much beyond his income, his lady had objected to the cutting of a pickled mango, and that I had taken an opportunity to a&s;k the price of it, and found it was only two &s;hillings; &s;o here was a very poor &s;aving. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, that is the blundering oeconomy of a narrow under&s;tanding. It is &s;topping one hole in a &s;ieve."</Q></P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome inclination to publi&s;h an account of my <HI>Travels</HI> upon the continent of Europe, for which I had a variety of materials collected. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I do not &s;ay, Sir, you may not publi&s;h your travels; but I give you my opinion, that you would le&s;&s;en your&s;elf by it. What can you tell of countries &s;o well known as tho&s;e upon the continent of Europe, which you have vi&s;ited?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But I can give an entertaining narrative, with
<PB N="233" REF="235" MS="y">
many incidents, anecdotes, <HI>jeux d'e&s;prit,</HI> and remarks, &s;o as to make very  plea&s;ant reading."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, mo&s;t modern travellers in Europe who have publi&s;hed their travels, have been laughed at: I would not have you added to the number <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">I believe, however&punc; I &s;hall follow my own opinion; for the world has &s;hewn a very flatter|ing partiality to my writings, on many occa&s;ions.</NOTE>. The world is now not contented to be merely enter|tained by a traveller's narrative; they want to learn &s;omething. Now &s;ome of my friends a&s;ked me why I did not give &s;ome account of my travels in France. The rea&s;on is plain; intelligent readers had &s;een more of France than I had. <HI>You</HI> might have liked my Travels in France, and THE CLUB might have liked them; but upon the whole there would have been more ridicule than good pro|duced by them."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I cannot agree with you, Sir. People would like to read what you &s;ay of any thing. Suppo&s;e a face has been painted by fifty painters before; &s;till we love to &s;ee it done by Sir Jo&s;hua."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"True, Sir, but Sir Jo&s;hua cannot paint a face when he has not time to look on it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, a &s;ketch of any &s;ort by him is valuable. And, Sir, to talk to you in your own &s;tyle (rai&s;ing my voice, and &s;haking my head,) you <HI>&s;hould</HI> have given us your Travels in France. I am <HI>&s;ure</HI> I am right, and <HI>there's an end on't.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>I &s;aid to him that it was certainly true as my friend Demp&s;ter had ob&s;erved in his letter to me upon the &s;ubject, that a great part of what was in his <Q REND="inline">"Journey to the We&s;tern I&s;lands of Scotland,"</Q> had been in his mind before he left London. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, yes, Sir, the topicks were; and books of travels will be good in proportion to what a man has previou&s;ly in his mind; his knowing what to ob&s;erve; his power of contra&s;ting one mode of life with another. As the Spani&s;h proverb &s;ays, 'He, who would bring home the wealth of the Indies, mu&s;t carry the wealth of the Indies with him.' So it is in travelling; a man mu&s;t carry knowledge with him if he would bring home knowledge."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"The proverb, I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, means, he mu&s;t carry a large &s;tock with him to trade with."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir."</Q></P>
<P>It was a delightful day: as we walked to St. Clement's church, I again remarked that Fleet-&s;treet was the mo&s;t cheerful &s;cene in the world. <Q REND="inline">"Fleet-&s;treet (&s;aid I,) is in my mind more delightful than Temp&eacute;."</Q> JOHNSON&punc; <Q REND="inline">"Aye, Sir; but let it be compared with Mull."</Q></P>
<P>There was a very numerous congregation to-day at St. Clement's church, which Dr. John&s;on &s;aid he ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="236" MS="y">
 And now I am to give a pretty full account of one of the mo&s;t curious incidents in John&s;on's life, of which he him&s;elf has made the following minute on this day: <Q REND="inline">"In my return from church, I was acco&s;ted by Edwards, an old fellow-collegian, who had not &s;een me &s;ince 1729. He knew me, and a&s;ked if I remembered one Edwards; I did not at fir&s;t recollect the name, but gradually as we walked along, recovered it, and told him a conver&s;ation that had pa&s;&s;ed at an alehou&s;e between us. My purpo&s;e is to continue our acquaintance <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>It was in Butcher-row that this meeting happened. Mr. Edwards, who was a decent-looking elderly man in grey clothes, and a wig of many curls, acco&s;ted John&s;on with familiar confidence, knowing who he was, while John&s;on returned his &s;alutation with a courteous formality, as to a &s;tranger. But as &s;oon as Edwards had brought to his recollection their having been at Pembroke-College together nine-and-thirty years ago, he &s;eemed much plea&s;ed, a&s;ked where he lived, and &s;aid he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee him in Bolt-Court. EDWARDS. <Q REND="inline">"Ah, Sir! we are old men now."</Q> JOHNSON. (who never liked to think of being old) <Q REND="inline">"Don't let us di&s;courage one another."</Q> EDWARDS. <Q REND="inline">"Why Doctor you look &s;tout and hearty, I am happy to &s;ee you &s;o; for the news-papers told us you were very ill."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Aye, Sir, they are always telling lies of <HI>us old fellows.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Wi&s;hing to be pre&s;ent at more of &s;o &s;ingular a conver&s;ation as that between two fellow collegians, who had lived near forty years in London without ever having chanced to meet, I whi&s;pered to Mr. Edwards that Dr. John&s;on was going home, and that he had better accompany him now. So Edwards walked along with us, I eagerly a&s;&s;i&s;ting to keep up the con|ver&s;ation. Mr. Edwards informed Dr. John&s;on that he had practi&s;ed long as a &s;olicitor in Chancery, but that he now lived in the country upon a little farm about &s;ixty acres, ju&s;t by Stevenage in Hertford&s;hire, and that he came to London (to Barnard's Inn, No. 6,) generally twice a week. John&s;on appearing to be in a reverie, Mr. Edwards addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, and expa|tiated on the plea&s;ure of living in the country. BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I have no notion of this, Sir. What you have to entertain you, is, I think, exhau&s;ted in half an hour."</Q> EDWARDS. <Q REND="inline">"What! don't you love to have hope reali&s;ed? I &s;ee my gra&s;s, and my corn, and my trees growing. Now, for in&s;tance, I am curious to &s;ee if this fro&s;t has not nipped my fruit trees."</Q> JOHNSON. (who we did not imagine was attending) <Q REND="inline">"You find, Sir, you have fears as well as hopes."</Q>&mdash;So well did he &s;ee the whole, when another &s;aw but the half of a &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="237" MS="y">
When we got to Dr. John&s;on's hou&s;e, and were &s;eated in his library, the  dialogue went on admirably. EDWARDS. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I remember you would not let us &s;ay <HI>prodigious</HI> at College. For even then, Sir, (turning to me,) he was delicate in language, and we all feared him <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">John&s;on &s;aid to me afterwards, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, they re&s;pected me for my literature; and yet it was not great but by compari&s;on.

(to Edwards) <Q REND="inline">"From your having practi&s;ed the law long, Sir, I pre&s;ume you mu&s;t be rich."</Q> EDWARDS. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, I got a good deal of money; but I had a number of poor relations to whom I gave a great part of it."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you have been rich in the mo&s;t valuable &s;en&s;e of the word."</Q> EDWARDS. <Q REND="inline">"But I &s;hall not die rich."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, &s;ure, Sir, it is better to <HI>live</HI> rich than to <HI>die</HI> rich."</Q> EDWARDS. <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h I had continued at College."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why do you wi&s;h that, Sir?"</Q> EDWARDS. <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e I think I &s;hould have had a much ea&s;ier life than mine has been. I &s;hould have been a par&s;on, and had a good living, like Bloxam and &s;everal others, and lived comfortably."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the life of a par&s;on, of a con&s;cientious clergyman, is not ea&s;y. I have always con&s;idered a clergyman as the father of a larger family than he is able to maintain. I would rather have Chancery &s;uits upon my hands than the cure of &s;ouls. No, Sir, I do not envy a clergyman's life as an ea&s;y life, nor do I envy the clergyman who makes it an ea&s;y life."</Q>&mdash;Here taking him&s;elf up all of a &s;udden, he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"O! Mr. Edwards! I'll convince you that I recollect you. Do you remember our drinking together at an alehou&s;e near Pembroke gate. At that time you told me of the Eton boy, who, when ver&s;es on our SAVIOUR'S turning water into wine were pre|&s;cribed as an exerci&s;e, brought up a &s;ingle line, which was highly admired:
<Q><L>'Vidit et erubuit lympha pudica <HI>DEUM.'</HI></L></Q>
and I told you of another fine line in 'Camden's Remains,' an eulogy upon one of our Kings, who was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on, a prince of equal merit:
<Q><L>'Mira cano, Sol occubuit, nox nulla &s;ecuta e&s;t."</L></Q></Q></P>
<P>EDWARDS. <Q REND="inline">"You are a philo&s;opher, Dr. John&s;on. I have tried too in my time to be a philo&s;opher; but, I don't know how, cheerfulne&s;s was always breaking in."</Q>&mdash;Mr. Burke, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Mr. Courtenay, Mr. Malone, and, indeed, all the eminent men to whom I have mentioned this, have thought it an exqui&s;ite trait of character. The truth is, that philo&s;ophy,
<PB N="236" REF="238" MS="y">
 like religion, is too generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be hard and &s;evere, at lea&s;t &s;o grave as to exclude all gaiety.</P>
<P>EDWARDS. <Q REND="inline">"I have been twice married, Doctor. You, I &s;uppo&s;e, have never known what it was to have a wife."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I have known what it was to have a wife, and (in a &s;olemn tender faultering tone) I have known what it was to <HI>lo&s;e a wife.</HI>&mdash;It had almo&s;t broke my heart."</Q></P>
<P>EDWARDS. <Q REND="inline">"How do you live, Sir? For my part, I mu&s;t have my regular meals, and a gla&s;s of good wine. I find I require it."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I now drink no wine, Sir. Early in life I drank wine: for many years I drank none. I then for &s;ome years drank a great deal."</Q> EDWARDS. <Q REND="inline">"Some hog&s;heads, I warrant you."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I then had a &s;evere illne&s;s, and left it off, and I have never begun it again. I never felt any difference upon my&s;elf from eating one thing rather than another, nor from one kind of weather rather than another. There are people, I believe, who feel a dif|ference; but I am not one of them. And as to regular meals, I have fa&s;ted from the Sunday's dinner to the Tue&s;day's dinner, without any inconvenience. I believe it is be&s;t to eat ju&s;t as one is hungry; but a man who is in bu&s;ine&s;s, or a man who has a family, mu&s;t have &s;tated meals. I am a &s;traggler. I may leave this town and go to Grand Cairo, without being mi&s;&s;ed here or ob&s;erved there."</Q> EDWARDS. <Q REND="inline">"Don't you eat &s;upper, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir."</Q> EDWARDS. <Q REND="inline">"For my part now, I con&s;ider &s;upper as a turnpike through which one mu&s;t pa&s;s, in order to get to bed <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">I am not ab&s;olutely &s;ure but this was my own &s;ugge&s;tion, though it is truly in the character of Edwards.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"You are a lawyer, Mr. Edwards. Lawyers know life practi|cally. A booki&s;h man &s;hould always have them to conver&s;e with. They have what he wants."</Q> EDWARDS. <Q REND="inline">"I am grown old: I am &s;ixty-five."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall be &s;ixty-eight next birth-day. Come, Sir, drink water, and put in for a hundred."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Edwards mentioned a gentleman who had left his whole fortune to Pembroke College. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Whether to leave one's whole fortune to a College be right, mu&s;t depend upon circum&s;tances. I would leave the intere&s;t of the fortune I bequeathed to a College to my relations or my friends, for their lives. It is the &s;ame thing to a College, which is a perma|nent &s;ociety, whether it gets the money now or twenty years hence; and I would wi&s;h to make my relations or friends feel the benefit of it."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="239" MS="y">
This interview confirmed my opinion of John&s;on's mo&s;t humane and bene|volent  heart. His cordial and placid behaviour to an old fellow-collegian, a man &s;o different from him&s;elf; and his telling him that he would go down to his farm and vi&s;it him, &s;hewed a kindline&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition very rare at an advanced age. He ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"how wonderful it was that they had both been in London almo&s;t forty years, without having ever once met, and both walkers in the &s;treet too!"</Q> Mr. Edwards, when going away, again recurred to his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;enility, and looking full in John&s;on's face, &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"You'll find in Dr. Young,
<Q><L>'O my coevals! remnants of your&s;elves."</L></Q></Q>
John&s;on did not reli&s;h this at all; but &s;hook his head with impatience. Edwards walked off, &s;eemingly highly plea&s;ed with the honour of having been thus noticed by Dr. John&s;on. When he was gone, I &s;aid to John&s;on, that I thought him but a weak man. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, yes, Sir. Here is a man who has pa&s;&s;ed through life without experience: yet I would rather have him with me than a more &s;en&s;ible man who will not talk readily. This man is always willing to &s;ay what he has to &s;ay."</Q> Yet Dr. John&s;on had him&s;elf by no means that willingne&s;s which he prai&s;ed &s;o much, and I think &s;o ju&s;tly; for who has not felt the painful effect of the dreary void, when there is a total &s;ilence in a company for any length of time; or, which is as bad, or perhaps wor&s;e, when the conver&s;ation is with difficulty kept up by a perpetual effort?</P>
<P>John&s;on once ob&s;erved to me, <Q REND="inline">"Tom Tyers de&s;cribed me the be&s;t: 'Sir, (&s;aid he,) you are like a gho&s;t: you never &s;peak till you are &s;poken to."</Q></P>
<P>The gentleman whom he thus familiarly mentioned was Mr. Thomas Tyers, &s;on of Mr. Jonathan Tyers, the founder of that excellent place of publick amu&s;ement, Vauxhall Gardens, which mu&s;t ever be an e&s;tate to its proprietor, as it is peculiarly adapted to the ta&s;te of the Engli&s;h nation; there being a mixture of curious &s;hew&mdash;gay exhibition&mdash;mu&s;ick, vocal and in&s;trumental, not too refined for the general ear&mdash;for all which only a &s;hilling is paid&mdash;and, though la&s;t not lea&s;t, good eating and drinking for tho&s;e who choo&s;e to purcha&s;e that regale. Mr. Thomas Tyers was bred to the law; but having a hand&s;ome fortune, vivacity of temper, and eccentricity of mind, he could not confine him&s;elf to the regularity of practice. He therefore ran about the world with a plea&s;ant carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, amu&s;ing every body by his de&s;ultory conver&s;ation. He abounded in anecdote, but was not &s;ufficiently attentive to accuracy. I therefore cannot
<PB N="238" REF="240" MS="y">
 venture to avail my&s;elf much of a biographical &s;ketch of John&s;on which he publi&s;hed, being one among the various per&s;ons ambitious of appending their names to that of my illu&s;trious friend. That &s;ketch is, however, an enter|taining little collection of fragments. Tho&s;e which he publi&s;hed of Pope and Addi&s;on are of higher merit; but his fame mu&s;t chiefly re&s;t upon his <Q REND="inline">"Political Conferences,"</Q> in which he introduces &s;everal eminent per&s;ons delivering their &s;entiments in the way of dialogue, and di&s;covers a con&s;iderable &s;hare of learn|ing, various knowledge, and di&s;cernment of character. This much may I be allowed to &s;ay of a man who was exceedingly obliging to me, and who lived with Dr. John&s;on in as ea&s;y a manner as almo&s;t any of his very numerous acquaintance.</P>
<P>Mr. Edwards had &s;aid to me a&s;ide, that Dr. John&s;on &s;hould have been of a profe&s;&s;ion. I repeated the remark to John&s;on that I might have his own thoughts on the &s;ubject. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it <HI>would</HI> have been better that I had been of a profe&s;&s;ion. I ought to have been a lawyer."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I do not think, Sir, it would have been better, for we &s;hould not have had the Engli&s;h Dictionary."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But you would have had Reports."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Aye; but there would not have been another who could have written the Dictionary. There have been many very good Judges. Suppo&s;e you had been Lord Chancellor; you would have delivered opinions with more extent of mind, and in a more ornamented manner, than perhaps any Chan|cellor ever did, or ever will do. But, I believe, cau&s;es have been as judiciou&s;ly decided as you could have done."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir. Property has been as well &s;ettled."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on, however, had a noble ambition floating in his mind, and had, un|doubtedly, often &s;peculated on the po&s;&s;ibility of his &s;upereminent powers being rewarded in this great and liberal country by the highe&s;t honours of the &s;tate. Sir William Scott informs me, that upon the death of the late Lord Lichfield, who was Chancellor of the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, he &s;aid to John&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"What a pity it is, Sir, that you did not follow the profe&s;&s;ion of the law. You might have been Lord Chancellor of Great-Britain, and attained to the dignity of the peerage; and now that the title of Lichfield, your native city, is extinct, you might have had it."</Q> John&s;on, upon this, &s;eemed much agitated; and, in an angry tone, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Why will you vex me by &s;ugge&s;ting this, when it is too late?"</Q></P>
<P>But he did not repine at the pro&s;perity of others. The late Dr. Thomas Leland told Mr. Courtenay, that when Mr. Edmund Burke &s;hewed John&s;on his fine hou&s;e and lands near Beaconsfield, John&s;on coolly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Non equidem invideo; miror magis."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="241" MS="y">
Yet no man had a higher notion of the dignity of literature than John&s;on,  or was more determined in maintaining the re&s;pect which he ju&s;tly con&s;idered as due to it. Of this, be&s;ides the general tenor of his conduct in &s;ociety, &s;ome characteri&s;tical in&s;tances may be mentioned.</P>
<P>He told Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, that once when he dined in a numerous company of book&s;ellers, where the room being &s;mall, the head of the table, at which he &s;at, was almo&s;t clo&s;e to the fire, he per&s;evered in &s;uffering a great deal of inconvenience from the heat, rather than quit his place, and let one of them &s;it above him.</P>
<P>Gold&s;mith, in his diverting &s;implicity, complained one day, in a mixed company, of Lord Camden. <Q REND="inline">"I met him (&s;aid he) at Lord Clare's hou&s;e in the country, and he took no more notice of me than if I had been an ordinary man."</Q> The company having laughed heartily, John&s;on &s;tood forth in defence of his friend. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, gentlemen, (&s;aid he,) Dr. Gold&s;mith is in the right. A nobleman ought to have made up to &s;uch a man as Gold&s;mith; and I think it is much again&s;t Lord Camden that he neglected him."</Q></P>
<P>Nor could he patiently endure to hear that &s;uch re&s;pect as he thought due only to higher intellectual qualities, &s;hould be be&s;towed on men of &s;lighter, though perhaps more amu&s;ing talents. I told him, that one morning, when I went to breakfa&s;t with Garrick, who was very vain of his intimacy with Lord Camden, he acco&s;ted me thus:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Pray now, did you?&mdash;did you meet a little lawyer turning the corner, eh?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir (&s;aid I). Pray what do you mean by the que&s;tion?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why, (replied Garrick, with an affected indifference, yet as if &s;tanding on tip-toe,) Lord Camden has this moment left me. We have had a long walk together."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, Garrick talked very properly. Lord Camden <HI>was</HI> a little lawyer to be a&s;&s;ociating &s;o familiarly with a player."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds has ob&s;erved, with great truth, that John&s;on con&s;idered Garrick to be as it were his <HI>property.</HI> He would allow no man either to blame or to prai&s;e Garrick in his pre&s;ence, without contradicting him.</P>
<P>Having fallen into a very &s;erious frame, in which mutual expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s pa&s;&s;ed between us, &s;uch as would be thought too vain in me to repeat, I talked with regret of the &s;ad inevitable certainty that one of us mu&s;t &s;urvive the other. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, that is an affecting con&s;ider|ation. I remember Swift, in one of his letters to Pope, &s;ays, 'I intend to come over, that we may meet once more; and when we mu&s;t part, it is what happens to all human beings."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"The hope that we &s;hall &s;ee our departed friends again mu&s;t &s;upport the mind."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, Sir."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"There is a &s;trange unwillingne&s;s to part with life, inde|pendent
<PB N="240" REF="242" MS="y">
 of &s;erious fears as to futurity. A reverend friend of ours (naming him) tells me, that he feels an unea&s;ine&s;s at the thoughts of leaving his hou&s;e, his &s;tudy, his books."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"This is fooli&s;h in *****. A man need not be unea&s;y on the&s;e grounds; for, as he will retain his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, he may &s;ay with the philo&s;opher, <HI>Omnia mea mecum porto.</HI>"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"True, Sir: we may carry our books in our head; but &s;till there is &s;omething painful in the thought of leaving for ever what has given us plea&s;ure. I remember many years ago, when my imagination was warm, and I happened to be in a melancholy mood, it di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me to think of going into a &s;tate of being in which Shak&s;peare's poetry did not exi&s;t. A lady whom I then much admired, a very amiable woman, humoured my fancy, and relieved me by &s;aying, 'The fir&s;t thing you will meet in the other world, will be an elegant copy of Shak&s;peare's works pre&s;ented to you."</Q> Dr. John&s;on &s;miled benignantly at this, and did not appear to di&s;approve of the notion.</P>
<P>We went to St. Clement's church again in the afternoon, and then returned and drank tea and coffee in Mrs. Williams's room; Mrs. De&s;moulins doing the honours of the tea-table. I ob&s;erved that he would not even look at a proof-&s;heet of his <Q REND="inline">"Life of Waller"</Q> on Good-Friday.</P>
<P>Mr. Allen, the printer, brought a book on agriculture, which was printed, and was &s;oon to be publi&s;hed. It was a very &s;trange performance, the authour having mixed in it his own thoughts upon various topicks, along with his remarks on ploughing, &s;owing, and other farming operations. He &s;eemed to be an ab&s;urd profane fellow, and had introduced in his book many &s;neers at religion, with equal ignorance and conceit. Dr. John&s;on permitted me to read &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages aloud. One was, that he re&s;olved to work on Sunday, and did work, but he owned he felt <HI>&s;ome</HI> weak compunction; and he had this very curious reflection:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I was born in the wilds of Chri&s;ti|anity, and the briars and thorns &s;till hang about me."</Q> Dr. John&s;on could not help laughing at this ridiculous image, yet was very angry at the fellow's impiety. <Q REND="inline">"However, (&s;aid he,) the Reviewers will make him hang him&s;elf."</Q> He however ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"that formerly there might have been a di&s;pen&s;ation obtained for working on Sunday in the time of harve&s;t."</Q> Indeed in ritual ob&s;ervances, were all the mini&s;ters of religion what they &s;hould be, and what many of them are, &s;uch a power might be wi&s;ely and &s;afely lodged with the Church.</P>
<P>On Saturday, April 14, I drank tea with him. He prai&s;ed the late Mr. Duncombe, of Canterbury, as a plea&s;ing man. <Q REND="inline">"He u&s;ed to come to me: I did not &s;eek much after <HI>him.</HI> Indeed I never &s;ought much after any body."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Lord Orrery, I &s;uppo&s;e."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, I never went
<PB N="241" REF="243" MS="y">
to him but when he &s;ent for me."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Richard&s;on?"</Q> JOHNSON.  <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir. But I &s;ought after George P&s;almanazar the mo&s;t. I u&s;ed to go and &s;it with him at an alehou&s;e in the city."</Q></P>
<P>I am happy to mention another in&s;tance which I di&s;covered of his <HI>&s;eeking after</HI> a man of merit. Soon after the Honourable Daines Barrington had publi&s;hed his excellent <Q REND="inline">"Ob&s;ervations on the Statutes,"</Q> John&s;on waited on that worthy and learned gentleman; and, having told him his name, cour|teou&s;ly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I have read your book, Sir, with great plea&s;ure, and wi&s;h to be better known to you."</Q> Thus began an acquaintance, which was continued with mutual regard as long as John&s;on lived.</P>
<P>Talking of a recent &s;editious delinquent, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"They &s;hould &s;et him in the pillory, that he may be puni&s;hed in a way that would di&s;grace him."</Q> I ob&s;erved, that the pillory does not always di&s;grace. And I mentioned an in&s;tance of a gentleman who I thought was not di&s;honoured by it. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Aye, but he was, Sir. He could not mouth and &s;trut as he u&s;ed to do, after having been there. People are not very willing to a&s;k a man to their tables who has &s;tood in the pillory."</Q></P>
<P>The gentleman who had dined with us at Dr. Percy's<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See p. 217 of this Volume.</NOTE> came in. John&s;on attacked the Americans with intemperate vehemence of abu&s;e. I &s;aid &s;ome|thing in their favour; and added, that I was always &s;orry when he talked on that &s;ubject. This, it &s;eems, exa&s;perated him; though he &s;aid nothing at the time. The cloud was charged with &s;ulphureous vapour, which was after|wards to bur&s;t in thunder.&mdash;We talked of a gentleman who was running out his fortune in London; and I &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"We mu&s;t get him out of it. All his friends mu&s;t quarrel with him, and that will &s;oon drive him away."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, we'll &s;end <HI>you</HI> to him. If your company does not drive a man out of his hou&s;e, nothing will."</Q> This was a horrible &s;hock, for which there was no vi&s;ible cau&s;e. I afterwards a&s;ked him why he had &s;aid &s;o har&s;h a thing. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e, Sir, you had made me angry about the Americans."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But why did not you take your revenge directly?"</Q> JOHNSON. (&s;miling) <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e, Sir, I had nothing ready. A man cannot &s;trike till he has his weapons."</Q> This was a candid and plea&s;ant confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He &s;hewed me to-night his drawing-room, very genteelly fitted up; and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Thrale &s;neered when I talked of my having a&s;ked you and your lady to live at my hou&s;e. I was obliged to tell her, that you would be in as re&s;pectable a &s;ituation in my hou&s;e as in hers. Sir, the in&s;olence of wealth
<PB N="242" REF="244" MS="y">
 will creep out."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"She has a little both of the in&s;olence of wealth, and the conceit of parts."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"The in&s;olence of wealth is a wretched thing; but the conceit of parts has &s;ome foundation. To be &s;ure it &s;hould not be. But who is without it?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Your&s;elf, Sir."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why I play no tricks: I lay no traps."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir. You are &s;ix feet high, and you only do not &s;toop."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of the numbers of people that &s;ometimes have compo&s;ed the hou&s;ehold of great families. I mentioned that there were a hundred in the family of the pre&s;ent Earl of Eglintoune's father. Dr. John&s;on &s;eeming to doubt it, I began to enumerate. <Q REND="inline">"Let us &s;ee: my Lord and my lady two."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, if you are to count by twos, you may be long enough."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Well, but now I add two &s;ons and &s;even daughters, and a &s;ervant for each, that will make twenty; &s;o we have the fifth part already."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Very true. You get at twenty pretty readily; but you will not &s;o ea&s;ily get further on. We grow to five feet pretty readily; but it is not &s;o ea&s;y to grow to &s;even."</Q></P>
<P>On Sunday, April 19, being Ea&s;ter-day, after the &s;olemnities of the fe&s;tival in St. Paul's church, I vi&s;ited him, but could not &s;tay to dinner. I expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to have the arguments for Chri&s;tianity always in readine&s;s, that my religious faith might be as firm and clear as any propo&s;ition whatever, &s;o that I need not be under the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s when it &s;hould be attacked. JOHNSON <Q REND="inline">"Sir you cannot an&s;wer all objections. You have demon&s;tration for a Fir&s;t Cau&s;e: you &s;ee he mu&s;t be good as well as powerful, becau&s;e there is nothing to make him otherwi&s;e, and goodne&s;s of it&s;elf is preferable. Yet you have again&s;t this, what is very certain, the unhappine&s;s of human life. This, however, gives us rea&s;on to hope for a future &s;tate of compen&s;ation, that there may be a perfect &s;y&s;tem. But of that we were not &s;ure till we had a po&s;itive revelation."</Q> I told him, that his <Q REND="inline">"Ra&s;&s;elas"</Q> had often made me unhappy; for it repre&s;ented the mi&s;ery of human life &s;o well, and &s;o con|vincingly to a thinking mind, that if at any time the impre&s;&s;ion wore off, and I felt my&s;elf ea&s;y, I began to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>On Monday, April 20, I found him at home in the morning. We talked of a gentleman who we apprehended was gradually involving his circum|&s;tances by bad management. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Wa&s;ting a fortune is evaporation by a thou&s;and imperceptible means. If it were a &s;tream, they'd &s;top it. You mu&s;t &s;peak to him. It is really mi&s;erable. Were he a game&s;ter, it could be &s;aid he had hopes of winning. Were he a bankrupt in trade, he might have grown rich; but he has neither &s;pirit to &s;pend, nor re&s;olution to
<PB N="243" REF="245" MS="y">
&s;pare. He does not &s;pend fa&s;t enough to have plea&s;ure from it. He has  the crime of prodigality, and the wretchedne&s;s of par&s;imony. If a man is killed in a duel, he is killed as many a one has been killed; but it is a &s;ad thing for a man to lie down and die; to bleed to death, becau&s;e he has not fortitude enough to &s;ear the wound, or even to &s;titch it up."</Q> I cannot but pau&s;e a moment to admire the fecundity of fancy, and choice of language, which in this in&s;tance, and, indeed, on almo&s;t all occa&s;ions, he di&s;played. It was well ob&s;erved by Dr. Percy, now Bi&s;hop of Dromore, <Q REND="inline">"The conver&s;a|tion of John&s;on is &s;trong and clear, and may be compared to an antique &s;tatue, where every vein and mu&s;cle is di&s;tinct and bold. Ordinary conver&s;a|tion re&s;embles an inferiour ca&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>On Saturday, April 25, I dined with him at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's, with the learned Dr. Mu&s;grave, Coun&s;ellor Leland of Ireland, &s;on to the hi&s;torian, Mrs. Cholmondeley, and &s;ome more ladies. <Q REND="inline">"The Project,"</Q> a new poem, was read to the company by Dr. Mu&s;grave. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it has no power. Were it not for the well-known names with which it is filled, it would be nothing: the names carry the poet, not the poet the names."</Q> MUSGRAVE. <Q REND="inline">"A temporary poem always entertains us."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"So does an account of the criminals hanged ye&s;terday entertain us."</Q></P>
<P>He proceeded:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Demo&s;thenes Taylor, as he was called, (that is, the tran&s;lator of Demo&s;thenes,) was the mo&s;t &s;ilent man, the mere&s;t &s;tatue of a man that I have ever &s;een. I once dined in company with him, and all he &s;aid during the whole time was no more than <HI>Richard.</HI> How a man &s;hould &s;ay only Richard, it is not ea&s;y to imagine. But it was thus: Dr. Douglas was talking of Dr. Zachary Grey, and a&s;cribing to him &s;omething that was written by Dr. Richard Grey. So to correct him, Taylor &s;aid, (imitating his affected &s;ententious empha&s;is and nod,) <HI>'Richard.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Cholmondeley, in a high flow of &s;pirits, exhibited &s;ome lively &s;allies of hyperbolical compliment to John&s;on, with whom &s;he had been long acquainted, and was very ea&s;y. He was quick in catching the <HI>manner</HI> of the moment, and an&s;wered her &s;omewhat in the &s;tyle of the hero of a romance, <Q REND="inline">"Madam, you crown me with un&s;ading laurels."</Q></P>
<P>I happened, I know not how, to &s;ay that a pamphlet meant a pro&s;e piece. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir. A few &s;heets of poetry unbound are a pamphlet, as much as a few &s;heets of pro&s;e."</Q> MUSGRAVE. <Q REND="inline">"A pamphlet may be under|&s;tood to mean a poetical piece, in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, that is in formal language; but in common language it is under&s;tood to mean pro&s;e."</Q> JOHNSON. (and here was one of the many in&s;tances of his knowing clearly
<PB N="244" REF="246" MS="y">
 and telling exactly how a thing is) <Q REND="inline">"A pamphlet is under&s;tood in common language to mean pro&s;e, only from this, that there is &s;o much more pro&s;e written than poetry; as when we &s;ay a <HI>book,</HI> pro&s;e is under&s;tood for the &s;ame rea&s;on, though a book may as well be in poetry as in pro&s;e. We under|&s;tand what is mo&s;t general, and we name what is le&s;s frequent."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of a certain lady's ver&s;es on Ireland. MISS REYNOLDS. <Q REND="inline">"Have you &s;een them, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Madam. I have &s;een a tran&s;lation from Horace, by one of her daughters. She &s;hewed it me."</Q> MISS REYNOLDS. <Q REND="inline">"And how was it, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why very well for a young Mi&s;s's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;es;&mdash;that is to &s;ay, compared with excellence, nothing; but, very well, for the per&s;on who wrote them. I am vexed at being &s;hewn ver&s;es in that manner."</Q> MISS REYNOLDS. <Q REND="inline">"But if they &s;hould be good, why not give them hearty prai&s;e?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Madam, becau&s;e I have not then got the better of my bad humour from having been &s;hewn them. You mu&s;t con&s;ider, Madam; before-hand they may be bad as well as good. Nobody has a right to put another under &s;uch a difficulty, that he mu&s;t either hurt the per&s;on by telling the truth, or hurt him&s;elf by telling what is is not true."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"A man often &s;hews his writings to people of eminence, to obtain from them, either from their good-nature, or from their not being able to tell the truth firmly, a commendation, of which he may afterwards avail him&s;elf."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Very true, Sir. Therefore a man, who is a&s;ked by an authour what he thinks of his work, is put to the torture, and is not obliged to &s;peak the truth; &s;o that what he &s;ays is not be con&s;idered as his opinion; yet he has &s;aid it, and cannot retract it; and this authour, when mankind are hunting him with a canni&s;ter at his tail, can &s;ay, 'I would not have publi&s;hed, had not John&s;on, or Reynolds, or Mu&s;grave, or &s;ome other good judge commended the work.' Yet I con&s;ider it as a very difficult que&s;tion in con&s;cience, whether one &s;hould advi&s;e a man not to publi&s;h a work, if profit be his object; for the man may &s;ay, 'Had it not been for you, I &s;hould have had the money.' Now you cannot be &s;ure; for you have only your own opinion, and the publick may think very differently."</Q> SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. <Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion have two judgements; one as to the real value of the work, the other as to what may plea&s;e the general ta&s;te at the time."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But you can be <HI>&s;ure</HI> of neither; and therefore I &s;hould &s;cruple much to give a &s;uppre&s;&s;ive vote. Both Gold&s;mith's comedies were once refu&s;ed; his fir&s;t by Garrick, his &s;econd by Colman, who was prevailed on at la&s;t by much &s;olicitation, nay, a kind of force, to bring it on. His
<PB N="245" REF="247" MS="y">
'Vicar of Wakefield' I my&s;elf did not think would have had much &s;ucce&s;s.  It was written and &s;old to a book&s;eller before his 'Traveller,' but publi&s;hed after; &s;o little expectation had the book&s;eller from it. Had it been &s;old after 'The Traveller,' he might have had twice as much money for it, though &s;ixty guineas was no mean price. The book&s;eller had the advantage of Gold&s;mith's reputation from 'The Traveller' in the &s;ale, though he had it not in &s;elling the copy."</Q> SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. <Q REND="inline">"The Beggars Opera affords a proof how &s;trangely people will differ in opinion about a literary performance. Burke thinks it has no merit."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It was refu&s;ed by one of the hou&s;es; but I &s;hould have thought it would &s;ucceed, not from any great excellence in the writing, but from the novelty, and the general &s;pirit and gaiety of the piece, which keeps the audience always attentive, and di&s;mi&s;&s;es them in good humour."</Q></P>
<P>We went to the drawing-room, where was a con&s;iderable increa&s;e of com|pany. Several of us got round Dr. John&s;on, and complained that he would not give us an exact catalogue of his works, that there might be a complete edition. He &s;miled, and evaded our intreaties. That he intended to do it I have no doubt, becau&s;e I have heard him &s;ay &s;o; and I have in my po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion an imperfect li&s;t, fairly written out, which he entitles <HI>Hi&s;toria Studiorum.</HI> I once got from one of his friends a li&s;t, which there was pretty good rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e was accurate, for it was written down in his pre&s;ence by this friend, who enumerated each article aloud, and had &s;ome of them mentioned to him by Mr. Levett, in concert with whom it was made out; and John&s;on, who heard all this, did not contradict it. But when I &s;hewed a copy of this li&s;t to him, and mentioned the evidence for its exactne&s;s, he laughed, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I was willing to let them go on as they plea&s;ed, and never interfered."</Q> Upon which I read it to him, article by article, and got him po&s;itively to own or refu&s;e; and then having obtained certainty &s;o far, I got &s;ome other articles confirmed by him directly, and afterwards, from time to time, made additions under his &s;anction.</P>
<P>His friend Edward Cave having been mentioned, he told us, <Q REND="inline">"Cave u&s;ed to &s;ell ten thou&s;and of 'The Gentleman's Magazine;' yet &s;uch was then his minute attention and anxiety that the &s;ale &s;hould not feel the &s;malle&s;t diminu|tion, that he would name a particular per&s;on who he heard had talked of leaving off the magazine, and would &s;ay, 'Let us have &s;omething good next month."</Q></P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved, that avarice was inherent in &s;ome di&s;po&s;itions. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No man was born a mi&s;er, becau&s;e no man was born to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Every

On Tue&s;day, April 28, he was engaged to dine at General Paoli's, where,  as I have already ob&s;erved, I was &s;till entertained in elegant ho&s;pitality, and with all the ea&s;e and comfort of a home. I called on him, and accompanied him in a hackney-coach. We &s;topped fir&s;t at the bottom of Hedge-lane, into which he went to leave a letter, <Q REND="inline">"with good news for a poor man in di&s;tre&s;s,"</Q> as he told me.

We &s;topped again at Wirgman's, the corner of St. James's-&s;treet, a <HI>toy-&s;hop,</HI> to which he had been directed, but not clearly, for he &s;earched about &s;ome time, and could not find it at fir&s;t; and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"To direct one only to a corner &s;hop is <HI>toying</HI> with one."</Q> I &s;uppo&s;e he meant this as a play upon the word <HI>toy:</HI> it was the fir&s;t time that I knew him &s;toop to &s;uch &s;port. After he had been &s;ome time in the &s;hop, he &s;ent for me to come out of the coach, and help him to choo&s;e a pair of &s;ilver buckles, as tho&s;e he had were too &s;mall. Probably this alteration in dre&s;s had been &s;ugge&s;ted by Mrs. Thrale, by a&s;&s;ociating with whom, his external appearance was much improved. He got better clothes; and the dark colour, from which he never deviated, was enlivened by metal buttons. His wigs, too, were much better; and during their travels in France, he was furni&s;hed with a Paris-made wig, of hand&s;ome con&s;truction. This choo&s;ing of &s;ilver buckles was a negociation: <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) I will not have the ridiculous large ones now in fa&s;hion; and I will give no more than a guinea for a pair."</Q> Such were the <HI>principles</HI> of the bu&s;ine&s;s; and, after &s;ome examination, he was fitted.

<P>We talked of drinking wine. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I require wine only when I am alone. I have then often wi&s;hed for it, and often taken it."</Q> SPOTTISWOODE. <Q REND="inline">"What, by way of a companion, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"To get rid of my&s;elf, to &s;end my&s;elf away. Wine gives great plea&s;ure; and every plea&s;ure is of it&s;elf a good. It is a good, unle&s;s counterbalanced by evil. A man may have a &s;trong rea&s;on not to drink wine; and that may be greater than the plea&s;ure. Wine makes a man better plea&s;ed with him&s;elf. I do not &s;ay that it makes him more plea&s;ing to others. Sometimes it does. But the danger is, that while a man grows better plea&s;ed with him&s;elf, he may be growing le&s;s plea&s;ing to others. Wine gives a man nothing. It neither gives him knowledge nor wit; it only animates a man, and enables him to bring out <NOTE PLACE="foot">^7 It is ob&s;erved in Waller's Life, in the <HI>Biographia Britannica,</HI> that he drank only water; and that while he &s;at in a company who were drinking wine, <Q REND="inline">"he had the dexterity to accommodate his di&s;cour&s;e to the pitch of theirs as it <HI>&s;unk.</HI>"</Q> If exce&s;s in drinking be meant, the remark is acutely ju&s;t. But &s;urely, a moderate u&s;e of wine gives a gaiety of &s;pirits which water-drinkers know not.</NOTE>
<PB N="249" REF="251" MS="y">
what a dread of the company has repre&s;&s;ed. It only puts in motion what  has been locked up in fro&s;t. But this may be good, or it may be bad."</Q> SPOTTISWOODE. <Q REND="inline">"So, Sir, wine is a key which opens a box: but this box may be either full or empty."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, conver&s;ation is the key: wine is a pick-lock which forces open the box and injures it. A man &s;hould cultivate his mind &s;o as to have that confidence and readine&s;s without wine, which wine gives."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"The great difficulty of re&s;i&s;ting wine is from benevolence. For in&s;tance, a good worthy man a&s;ks you to ta&s;te his wine which he has had twenty years in his cellar."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, all this notion about benevolence ari&s;es from a man's imagining him&s;elf to be of more importance to others, than he really is. They don't care a farthing whether he drinks wine or not."</Q> SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, they do for the time."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"For the time!&mdash;If they care this minute, they forget it the next. And as for the good worthy man; how do we know he is good and worthy? No good and worthy man will in&s;i&s;t upon another man's drink|ing wine. As to the wine twenty years in the cellar&mdash;of ten men, three &s;ay this, merely becau&s;e they mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omething;&mdash;three are telling a lie, when they &s;ay they have had the wine twenty years;&mdash;three would rather &s;ave the wine;&mdash;one, perhaps, cares. I allow it is &s;omething to plea&s;e one's com|pany; and people are always plea&s;ed with tho&s;e who partake plea&s;ure with them. But after a man has brought him&s;elf to relinqui&s;h the great per&s;onal plea&s;ure which ari&s;es from drinking wine, any other con&s;ideration is a trifle. To plea&s;e others by drinking wine, is &s;omething, only if there be nothing again&s;t it. I &s;hould, however, be-&s;orry to offend worthy men:
<Q><L>'Cur&s;t be the ver&s;e, how well &s;oe'er it flow,</L>

<P>On Wedne&s;day, April 29, I dined with him at Mr. Allan Ram&s;ay's, where were Lord Binning, Dr. Robert&s;on the hi&s;torian, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, and the Honourable Mrs. Bo&s;cawen, widow of the Admiral, and mother of the pre&s;ent Vi&s;count Falmouth, of whom, if it be not pre&s;umptuous in me to prai&s;e her, I would &s;ay, that her manners are the mo&s;t agreeable, and her conver&s;ation the be&s;t of any lady with whom I ever had the happine&s;s to be acquainted. Before John&s;on came we talked a good deal of him; Ram&s;ay &s;aid he had always found him a very polite man, and that he treated him with great re&s;pect, which he did very &s;incerely.

 &s;trenuou&s;ly defend the mo&s;t minute circum&s;tance connected with the Church of England."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Believe me, Doctor, you are much mi&s;taken as to this; for when you talk with him calmly in private, he is very liberal in his way of thinking."</Q> ROBERTSON. <Q REND="inline">"He and I have been always very gracious; the fir&s;t time I met him was one evening at Strahan's, when he had ju&s;t had an unlucky altercation with Adam Smith, to whom he had been &s;o rough, that Strahan, after Smith was gone, had remon&s;trated with him, and told him that I was coming &s;oon, and that he was unea&s;y to think that he might behave in the &s;ame manner to me. 'No, no, Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) I warrant you Robert&s;on and I &s;hall do very well.' Accordingly he was gentle and good-humoured, and courteous with me the whole evening&punc; and he has been &s;o upon every occa&s;ion that we have met &s;ince.

<P>No &s;ooner did he, of whom we had been thus talking &s;o ea&s;ily, arrive, than we were all as quiet as a &s;chool upon the entrance of the head-ma&s;ter; and were very &s;oon &s;et down to a table covered with &s;uch variety of good things as contributed not a little to di&s;po&s;e him to be plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>RAMSAY. <Q REND="inline">"I am old enough to have been a contemporary of Pope. His poetry was highly admired in his life-time, more a great deal than after his death."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it has not been le&s;s admired after his death; no authours ever had &s;o much fame in their own life-time as Pope and Voltaire; and Pope's poetry has been as much admired after his death as during his life; it has only not been as much talked of, but that is owing to its being now more di&s;tant, and people having other writings to talk of. Virgil is le&s;s talked of than Pope, and Homer is le&s;s talked of than Virgil; but they are not le&s;s admired. We mu&s;t read what the world reads at the moment. It has been maintained that this &s;uperfcetation, this teeming of the pre&s;s in modern times, is prejudicial to good literature, becau&s;e it obliges us to read &s;o much of what is of inferiour value, in order to be in the fa&s;hion; &s;o that better works are neglected for want of time, becau&s;e a man will have more gratification of his vanity in conver&s;ation, from having read modern books, than from having read the be&s;t works of antiquity. But it mu&s;t be con&s;idered,
<PB N="253" REF="255" MS="y">
that we have now more knowledge generally diffu&s;ed; all our ladies read  now, which is a great exten&s;ion. Modern writers are the moons of literature, they &s;hine with reflected light, with light borrowed from the ancients. Greece appears to me to be the fountain of knowledge; Rome of elegance."</Q> RAMSAY. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e Homer's 'Iliad' to be a collection of pieces which had been written before his time. I &s;hould like to &s;ee a tran&s;lation of it in poetical pro&s;e like the book of Ruth or Job."</Q> ROBERTSON. <Q REND="inline">"Would you, Dr. John&s;on, who are ma&s;ter of the Engli&s;h language, but try your hand upon a part of it."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you could not read it without the plea&s;ure of ver&s;e <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">This experiment which Madame Dacier made in vain, has &s;ince been tried in our own language, by the editor of <Q REND="inline">"O&s;&s;ian,"</Q> and we mu&s;t either think very meanly of his abilities, or allow that Dr. John&s;on was in the right.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of antiquarian re&s;earches. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"All that is really <HI>known</HI> of the ancient &s;tate of Britain is contained in a few pages. We <HI>can</HI> know no more than what the old writers have told us; yet what large books have we upon it, the whole of which excepting &s;uch parts as are taken from tho&s;e old writers is all a dream, &s;uch as Whitaker's 'Manche&s;ter.' I have heard Henry's 'Hi&s;tory of Britain' well &s;poken of, I am told it is carried on in &s;eparate divi&s;ions, as the civil, the military, the religious hi&s;tory; I wi&s;h much to have one branch well done, and that is the hi&s;tory of manners, of common life."</Q> ROBERTSON. <Q REND="inline">"Henry &s;hould have applied his attention to that alone, which is enough for any man; and he might have found a great deal &s;cattered in various books, had he read &s;olely with that view. Henry erred in not &s;elling his fir&s;t volume at a moderate price to the book&s;ellers, that they might have pu&s;hed him on till he had got reputation. I &s;old my 'Hi&s;tory of Scotland' at a moderate price, as a work by which the book&s;ellers might either gain or not; and Cadell has told me that Millar and he have got &s;ix thou&s;and pounds by it. I afterwards received a much higher price for my writings. An authour &s;hould &s;ell his fir&s;t work for what the book&s;ellers will give, till it &s;hall appear whether he is an authour of merit, or, which is the &s;ame thing as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">rcha&s;e-money, an authour who plea&s;es the publick."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Robert&s;on expatiated on the character of a certain nobleman; that he was one of the &s;tronge&s;t-minded men that ever lived; that he would &s;it in company quite &s;luggi&s;h, while there was nothing to call &s;orth his intellectual vigour; but the moment that any important &s;ubject was &s;tarted, for in&s;tance, how this country is to be defended again&s;t a French inva&s;ion, he would rou&s;e

 him&s;elf, and &s;hew his extraordinary talents with the mo&s;t powerful ability and animation." JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yet this man cut his own throat. The true &s;trong and &s;ound mind is the mind that can embrace equally great things and &s;mall. Now I am told the King of Pru&s;&s;ia will &s;ay to a &s;ervant, 'Bring me a bottle of &s;uch a wine, which came in &s;uch a year; it lies in &s;uch a corner of the cellars.' I would have a man to be great in great things, and elegant in little things."</Q> He &s;aid to me afterwards when we were by our&s;elves, <Q REND="inline">"Robert&s;on was in a mighty romantick humour, he talked of one whom he did not know; but I <HI>downed</HI> him with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia.</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, (&s;aid I,) you threw a <HI>bottle</HI> at his head."</Q></P>
<P>An ingenious gentleman was mentioned, concerning whom both Robert&s;on and Ram&s;ay agreed that he had a con&s;tant firmne&s;s of mind; for after a laborious day, and amid&s;t a multiplicity of cares and anxieties, he would &s;it down with his &s;i&s;ters and be quite cheerful and good-humoured. Such a di&s;po&s;ition it was ob&s;erved, was a happy gift of nature. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I do not think &s;o; a man has from nature a certain portion of mind; the u&s;e he makes of it depends upon his own free will. That a man has always the &s;ame firmne&s;s of mind I do not &s;ay; becau&s;e every man feels his mind le&s;s firm at one time than at another; but I think a man's being in a good or bad humour depends upon his will."</Q> I, however, could not help thinking that a man's humour is often uncontroulable by his will.</P>
<P>John&s;on harangued again&s;t drinking wine, <Q REND="inline">"A man (&s;aid he) may choo&s;e whether he will have ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s and knowledge, or claret and ignorance."</Q> Dr. Robert&s;on (who is very companionable) was beginning to di&s;&s;ent as to the pro&s;cription of claret. JOHNSON. (with a placid &s;mile) <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, you &s;hall not differ with me; as I have &s;aid that the man is mo&s;t perfect who takes in the mo&s;t things, I am for knowledge and claret."</Q> ROBERTSON. (holding a gla&s;s of generous claret in his hand) <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I can only drink your health."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I &s;hould be &s;orry if <HI>you</HI> &s;hould be ever in &s;uch a &s;tate as to be able to do nothing more."</Q> ROBERTSON. <Q REND="inline">"Dr. John&s;on, allow me to &s;ay, that in one re&s;pect I have the advantage of you; when you were in Scotland you would not come to hear any of our preachers, whereas when I am here I attend your publick wor&s;hip without &s;cruple, and indeed, with great &s;atis|faction."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, that is not &s;o extraordinary: the King of Siam &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Louis the Fourteenth; but Louis the Fourteenth &s;ent none to the King of Siam <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Piozzi confidently mentions this as having pa&s;&s;ed in Scotland. <Q REND="inline">"Anecdotes,"</Q> p. 62.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="257" MS="y">
Here my friend for once di&s;covered a want of knowledge or forgetfulne&s;s; for  Louis the Fourteenth did &s;end an emba&s;&s;y to the King of Siam, and the Abb&eacute; Choi&s;is, who was employed in it, publi&s;hed an account of it in two volumes.</P>
<P>Next day, Thur&s;day, April 30, I found him at home by him&s;elf. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, Ram&s;ay gave us a &s;plendid dinner, I love Ram&s;ay. You will not find a man in who&s;e conver&s;ation there is more in&s;truction, more informa|tion, and more elegance, than in Ram&s;ay's."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"What I admire in Ram&s;ay, is his continuing to be &s;o young."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, Sir, it is to be admired. I value my&s;elf upon this, that there is nothing of the old man in my conver&s;ation. I am now &s;ixty-eight, and I have no more of it than at twenty-eight."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, would not you wi&s;h to know old age? He who is never an old man does not know the whole of human life; for old age is one of the divi&s;ions of it."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, what talk is this?</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I mean, Sir, the Sphinx's de&s;cription of it&mdash;morning, noon, and night. I would know night, as well as morning and noon."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"What, Sir, would you know what it is to feel the evils of old age? Would you have the gout? Would you have decrepi|tude?"</Q>&mdash;Seeing him heated, I would not argue any farther; but I was con|fident that I was in the right. I would, in due time, be a Ne&s;tor, an elder of the people; and there <HI>&s;hould</HI> be &s;ome difference between the conver&s;ation of twenty-eight and &s;ixty-eight. A grave picture &s;hould not be gay. There is a &s;erene, &s;olemn, placid old age. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Thrale's mother &s;aid of me what flattered me much. A clergyman was complaining of want of &s;ociety in the country where he lived; and &s;aid, 'They talk of <HI>runts;'</HI> (that is, young cows). 'Sir, (&s;aid Mrs. Salu&s;bury,) Mr. John&s;on would learn to talk of runts:' meaning that I was a man who would make the mo&s;t of my &s;ituation, whatever it was."</Q> He added, <Q REND="inline">"I think my&s;elf a very polite man."</Q></P>
<P>On Saturday, May 2, I dined with him at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's, where there was a very large company, and a great deal of conver&s;ation; but owing to &s;ome circum&s;tance which I cannot now recollect, I have no record of any part of it, except that there were &s;everal people there by no means of the John&s;onian &s;chool; &s;o that le&s;s attention was paid to him than u&s;ual, which put him out of humour; and upon &s;ome imaginary offence from me, he attacked me with &s;uch rudene&s;s, that I was vexed and angry, becau&s;e it gave tho&s;e per&s;ons an opportunity of enlarging upon his &s;uppo&s;ed ferocity, and ill treatment of his be&s;t friends. I was &s;o much hurt, and had my pride &s;o much rou&s;ed, that I kept away from him for a week; and, perhaps,
<PB N="256" REF="258" MS="y">
 might have kept away much longer, nay, gone to Scotland without &s;eeing him again, had not we fortunately met and been reconciled. To &s;uch un|happy chances are human friend&s;hips liable.</P>
<P>On Friday, May 8, I dined with him at Mr. Langton's. I was re&s;erved and &s;ilent, which I &s;uppo&s;e he perceived, and might recollect the cau&s;e. After dinner, when Mr. Langton was called out of the room, and we were by our&s;elves, he drew his chair near to mine, and &s;aid, in a tone of conciliating courte&s;y, <Q REND="inline">"Well, how have you done?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you have made me very unea&s;y by your behaviour to me when we were la&s;t at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's. You know, my dear Sir, no man has a greater re&s;pect and affection for you, or would &s;ooner go to the end of the world to &s;erve you. Now to treat me &s;o&mdash;."</Q> He in&s;i&s;ted that I had interrupted him, which I a&s;&s;ured him was not the ca&s;e; and proceeded, <Q REND="inline">"But why treat me &s;o before people who neither love you nor me?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Well, I am &s;orry for it. I'll make it up to you twenty different ways, as you plea&s;e."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;aid to-day to Sir Jo&s;hua, when he ob&s;erved that you <HI>to&s;&s;ed</HI> me &s;ometimes, I don't care how often, or how high he to&s;&s;es me, when only friends are pre&s;ent, for then I fall upon &s;oft ground: but I do not like falling on &s;tones, which is the ca&s;e when enemies are pre&s;ent.&mdash;I think this a pretty good image, Sir."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is one of the happie&s;t I have ever heard."</Q></P>
<P>The truth is, there was no venom in the wounds which he inflicted at any time, unle&s;s they were irritated by &s;ome malignant infu&s;ion by other hands. We were in&s;tantly as cordial again as ever, and joined in hearty laugh at &s;ome ludicrous but innocent peculiarities of one of our friends. BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Do you think, Sir, it is always culpable to laugh at a man to his face?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, that depends upon the man and the thing. If it is a &s;light man, and a &s;light thing, you may; for you take nothing valuable from him."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I read ye&s;terday Dr. Blair's &s;ermon on Devotion, from the text <HI>'Cornelius, a devout man.'</HI> His doctrine is the be&s;t limited, the be&s;t expre&s;&s;ed: there is the mo&s;t warmth without fanatici&s;m, the mo&s;t rational tran&s;port. There is one part of it which I di&s;approve, and I'd have him correct it; which is, that 'he who does not feel joy in religion is far from the kingdom of heaven.' There are many good men who&s;e fear of GOD predominates over their love. It may di&s;courage. It was ra&s;hly &s;aid. A noble &s;ermon it is indeed. I wi&s;h Blair would come over to the Church of England."</Q></P>
<P>When Mr. Langton returned to us, the <Q REND="inline">"flow of talk"</Q> went on. An eminent authour being mentioned;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"He is not a plea&s;ant man. His conver&s;ation is neither in&s;tructive nor brilliant. He does not talk as if
<PB N="257" REF="259" MS="y">
impelled by any fullne&s;s of knowledge or vivacity of imagination. His  conver&s;ation is like that of any other &s;en&s;ible man. He talks with no wi&s;h either to inform or to hear, but only becau&s;e he thinks it does not become&mdash;to &s;it in a company and &s;ay nothing."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Langton having repeated the anecdote of Addi&s;on having di&s;tingui&s;hed between his powers in conver&s;ation and in writing, by &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"I have only nine-pence in my pocket; but I can draw for a thou&s;and pounds;"</Q>&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"He had not that retort ready, Sir; he had prepared it before-hand."</Q> LANGTON. (turning to me) <Q REND="inline">"A fine &s;urmi&s;e. Set a thief to catch a thief."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on called the Ea&s;t-Indians barbarians. BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"You will except the Chine&s;e, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Have they not arts?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"They have pottery."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"What do you &s;ay to the written characters of their language?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, they have not an alphabet. They have not been able to form what all other nations have formed.</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"There is more learning in their language than in any other, from the immen&s;e number of their characters."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It is only more difficult from its rudene&s;s; as there is more labour in hewing down a tree with a &s;tone than with an axe."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I have been reading Lord Kames's 'Sketches of the Hi&s;tory of Man.' In treating of &s;everity of puni&s;hment, he mentions that of Madame Lapouchin, in Ru&s;&s;ia, but he does not give it fairly; for I have looked at <HI>Chappe D'Auteroche,</HI> from whom he has taken it. He &s;tops where it is &s;aid that the &s;pectators thought her innocent, and leaves out what follows; that &s;he neverthele&s;s was guilty. Now this is being as culpable as one can conceive, to mi&s;repre&s;ent fact in a book, and for what motive? It is like one of tho&s;e lies which people tell, one cannot &s;ee why. The woman's life was &s;pared; and no puni&s;hment is too great for the favourite of an Empre&s;s who had con&s;pired to dethrone her mi&s;tre&s;s.</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"He was only giving a picture of the lady in her &s;ufferings."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, don't endeavour to palliate this. Guilt is a principal feature in the picture. Kames is puzzled with a que&s;tion that puzzled me when I was a very young man. Why is it that the intere&s;t of money is lower, when money is plentiful; for five pounds has the &s;ame proportion of value to a hundred pounds when money is plentiful, as when it is &s;carce? A lady explained it to me. 'It is (&s;aid &s;he) becau&s;e when money is plentiful there are &s;o many more who have money to lend, that they bid down one another. Many have then a hundred pounds; and one &s;ays, Take mine rather than another's, and you &s;hall have it at four <HI>per cent.</HI>"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Does Lord Kames decide the que&s;tion?"</Q> JOHNSON.
<PB N="258" REF="260" MS="y">
 <Q REND="inline">"I think he leaves it as he found it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"This mu&s;t have been an extraordinary lady who in&s;tructed you, Sir. May I a&s;k who &s;he was?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Molly A&s;ton <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">John&s;on had an extraordinary admiration of this lady, notwith&s;tanding &s;he was a violent Whig. In an&s;wer to her high-&s;lown &s;peeches for <HI>Liberty,</HI> he addre&s;&s;ed to her the following Epigram, of which I pre&s;ume to offer a tran&s;lation:
<Q><L>"Liber ut e&s;&s;e velim &s;ua&s;i&s;ti pulchra Maria,</L>
<L>"Ut maneam liber pulchra Maria val."</L></Q>
<Q><L>Adieu, Maria! &s;ince you'd have me free;</L>
<L>For, who beholds thy charms a &s;lave mu&s;t be,</L></Q></NOTE>, Sir, the &s;i&s;ter of tho&s;e ladies with whom you dined at Lichfield.&mdash;I &s;hall be at home to-morrow."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Then let us dine by our&s;elves at the Mitre, to keep up the old cu&s;tom, 'the cu&s;tom of the Manor,' the cu&s;tom of the mitre."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, &s;o it &s;hall be."</Q></P>
<P>On Saturday, May 9, we fulfilled our purpo&s;e of dining by our&s;elves at the Mitre, according to old cu&s;tom. There was, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, a little circum&s;tance of kind attention to Mrs. Williams, which mu&s;t not be omitted. Before coming out, and leaving her to dine alone, he gave her her choice of a chicken, a &s;weetbread, or any other little nice thing, which was carefully &s;ent to her from the tavern, ready dre&s;t.</P>
<P>Our conver&s;ation to-day, I know not how, turned, (I think for the only time at any length, during our long acquaintance,) upon the &s;en&s;ual intercour&s;e between the &s;exes, the delight of which he a&s;cribed chiefly to imagination. <Q REND="inline">"Were it not for imagination, Sir, (&s;aid he,) a man would be as happy in the arms of a chambermaid as of a Duche&s;s. But &s;uch is the adventitious charm of fancy, that we find men who have violated the be&s;t principles of &s;ociety, and ruined their fame and their fortune, that they might po&s;&s;e&s;s a woman of rank."</Q> It would not be proper to record the particulars of &s;uch a conver&s;ation in mo|ments of unre&s;erved frankne&s;s, when nobody was pre&s;ent on whom it could have any hurtful effect. That &s;ubject, when philo&s;ophically treated, may &s;urely employ the mind in as curious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and as innocently as anatomy; provided that tho&s;e who do treat it keep clear of inflammatory incentives.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"From grave to gay, from lively to &s;evere,"</Q>&mdash;we were &s;oon engaged in very different &s;peculation; humbly and reverently con&s;idering and wondering at the univer&s;al my&s;tery of all things, as our imperfect faculties can now judge of them. <Q REND="inline">"There are (&s;aid he) innumerable que&s;tions to which the inqui&s;i|tive mind can in this &s;tate receive no an&s;wer: Why do you and I exi&s;t? Why was this world created? Since it was to be created, why was it not created &s;ooner?"</Q></P>

On Sunday, May 10, I &s;upped with him at Mr. Hoole's, with Sir Jo&s;hua  Reynolds. I have neglected the memorial of this evening, &s;o as to remember no more of it than two particulars; one, that he &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed an argument by Sir Jo&s;hua, that virtue was preferable to vice, con&s;idering this life only; and that a man would be virtuous were it only to pre&s;erve his character: and, that he expre&s;&s;ed much wonder at the curious formation of the bat, a mou&s;e with wings; &s;aying, that <Q REND="inline">"it was almo&s;t as &s;trange a thing in phy&s;iology, as if the fabulous dragon could be &s;een."</Q></P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, May 12, I waited on the Earl of Marchmont, to know if his Lord&s;hip would favour Dr. John&s;on with information concerning Pope, who&s;e Life he was about to write. John&s;on had not flattered him&s;elf with the hopes of receiving any civility from this nobleman; for he &s;aid to me, when I mentioned Lord Marchmont as one who could tell him a great deal about Pope, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he will tell <HI>me</HI> nothing."</Q> I had the honour of being known to his Lord&s;hip, and applied to him of my&s;elf, without being commi&s;&s;ioned by John&s;on. His Lord&s;hip behaved in the mo&s;t polite and obliging manner, promi&s;ed to tell all he recollected about Pope, and was &s;o very courteous as to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Tell Dr. John&s;on I have a great re&s;pect for him, and am ready to &s;hew it in any way I can. I am to be in the city to-morrow, and will call at his hou&s;e as I return."</Q> His Lord&s;hip however a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"Will he write the Lives of the Poets impartially? He was the fir&s;t that brought Whig and Tory into a Dictionary. And what do you think of his definition of Exci&s;e? Do you know the hi&s;tory of his aver&s;ion to the word <HI>tran&s;pire?</HI>"</Q> Then taking down the folio Dictionary, he &s;hewed it with this cen&s;ure on its &s;econdary &s;en&s;e: <Q REND="inline"><Q REND="inline">"To e&s;cape from &s;ecre&s;y to notice; a &s;en&s;e lately innovated from France, without nece&s;&s;ity."</Q> The truth was, Lord Bolingbroke, who left the Jacobites, fir&s;t u&s;ed it; therefore, it was to be condemned. He &s;hould have &s;hewn what word would do for it, if it was unnece&s;&s;ary."</Q> I afterwards put the que&s;tion to John&s;on: <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, (&s;aid he,) <HI>get abroad.</HI>"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"That, Sir, is u&s;ing two words."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, there's no end of this.

<P>I availed my&s;elf of this opportunity to hear from his Lord&s;hip many par|ticulars both of Pope and Lord Bolingbroke, which I have in writing.</P>
<P>I propo&s;ed to Lord Marchmont that he &s;hould revi&s;e John&s;on's Life of Pope: <Q REND="inline">"So (&s;aid his Lord&s;hip) you would put me in a dangerous &s;ituation. You know he knocked down O&s;borne the book&s;eller."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="262" MS="y">
 Elated with the &s;ucce&s;s of my &s;pontaneous exertion to procure material and re&s;pectable aid to John&s;on for his very favourite work, <Q REND="inline">"The Lives of the Poets."</Q> I ha&s;tened down to Mr. Thrale's at Streatham, where he now was, that I might in&s;ure his being at home next day; and after dinner, when I thought he would receive the good news in the be&s;t humour, I announced it eagerly: <Q REND="inline">"I have been at work for you to-day, Sir. I have been with Lord Marchmont. He bid me tell you he has a great re&s;pect for you, and will call on you to-morrow at one o'clock, and communicate all he knows about Pope."</Q>&mdash;Here I pau&s;ed, in full expectation that he would be plea&s;ed with this intelligence, would prai&s;e my active merit, and would be alert to embrace &s;uch an offer from a nobleman. But whether I had &s;hewn an over exultation, which provoked his &s;pleen; or whether he was &s;eized with a &s;u&s;picion that I had obtruded him on Lord Marchmont, and had humbled him too much; or whether there was any thing more than an unlucky fit of ill humour, I know not; but, to my &s;urprize, the re&s;ult was,&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall not be in town to-morrow. I don't care to know about Pope."</Q> MRS. THRALE. (&s;urprized as I was, and a little angry) <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, Mr. Bo&s;well thought, that as you are to write Pope's Life, you would wi&s;h to know about him."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Wi&s;h! why yes. If it rained know|ledge I'd hold out my hand; but I would not give my&s;elf the trouble to go in que&s;t of it."</Q> There was no arguing with him at the moment. Some time afterwards he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Lord Marchmont will call on me, and then I &s;hall call on Lord Marchmont."</Q> Mr. Thrale was unea&s;y at his unaccountable caprice; and told me, that if I did not take care to bring about a meeting between Lord Marchmont and him, it would never take place, which would be a great pity. I &s;ent a card to his Lord&s;hip, to be left at John&s;on's hou&s;e, acquainting him, that Dr. John&s;on could not be in town next day, but would do him&s;elf the honour of waiting on him at another time.&mdash;I give this account fairly, as a &s;pecimen of that unhappy temper with which this great and good man had occa&s;ionally to &s;truggle, from &s;omething morbid in his con&s;titution. Let the mo&s;t cen&s;orious of my readers &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf to have a violent fit of the tooth-ach, or to have received a &s;evere &s;troke on the &s;hin|bone, and when in &s;uch a &s;tate to be a&s;ked a que&s;tion; and if he has any, candour, he will not be &s;urprized at the an&s;wers which John&s;on &s;ometimes gave in moments of irritation, which, let me a&s;&s;ure them, is exqui&s;itely painful. But it mu&s;t not be erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed that he was, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, carele&s;s concerning any work which he undertook, or that he wsa generally thus peevi&s;h. It will be &s;een, that in the following year he had a very agreeable interview with Lord Marchmont, at his Lord&s;hip's
<PB N="261" REF="263" MS="y">
hou&s;e; and this very afternoon he &s;oon forgot any fretfulne&s;s, and fell into  conver&s;ation as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>I mentioned a reflection having been thrown out again&s;t four Peers for having pre&s;umed to ri&s;e in oppo&s;ition to the opinion of the twelve Judges, in a cau&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Lords, as if that were indecent. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, there is no ground for cen&s;ure. The Peers are Judges them&s;elves: and &s;up|po&s;ing them really to be of a different opinion, they might from duty be in oppo&s;ition to the Judges, who were there only to be con&s;ulted."</Q></P>
<P>In this ob&s;ervation I fully concurred with him; for, unque&s;tionably, all the Peers are ve&s;ted with the highe&s;t judicial powers; and, when they are confident that they under&s;tand a cau&s;e, are not obliged, nay ought not to acquie&s;ce in the opinion of the ordinary law Judges, or even in that of tho&s;e who from their &s;tudies and experience are called the Law Lords. I con&s;ider the Peers in general as I do a Jury, who ought to li&s;ten with re&s;pectful atten|tion to the &s;ages of the law; but, if after hearing them, they have a firm opinion of their own, are bound, as hone&s;t men, to decide accordingly. Nor is it &s;o difficult for them to under&s;tand even law que&s;tions, as is generally thought; provided they will be&s;tow &s;ufficient attention upon them. This ob&s;ervation was made by my honoured relation the late Lord Cathcart, who had &s;pent his life in camps and courts; yet a&s;&s;ured me, that he could form a clear opinion upon mo&s;t of the cau&s;es that came before the Hou&s;e of Lords, <Q REND="inline">"as they were &s;o well enucleated in the Ca&s;es."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Thrale told us, that a curious clergyman of our acquaintance had di&s;covered a licentious &s;tanza, which Pope had originally in his <Q REND="inline">"Univer&s;al Prayer,"</Q> before the &s;tanza
<Q><L>"What con&s;cience dictates to be done,</L>
<L>"Or warns us not to do, &amp;c.</L></Q>
It was this:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Can &s;ins of moment claim the rod</L>
<L>"Of everla&s;ting fires?</L>
<L>"And that offend great Nature's GOD,</L>
<L>"Which Nature's &s;elf in&s;pires?"</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>and that Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"it had been borrowed from <HI>Guarini.</HI>"</Q> There are, indeed, in <HI>Pa&s;tor Fido,</HI> many &s;uch flim&s;y &s;uperficial rea&s;onings, as that in the two la&s;t lines of this &s;tanza.</P>
<P>BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"In that &s;tanza of Pope's, <HI>'rod of &s;ires,'</HI> is certainly a bad metaphor."</Q> MRS. THRALE. <Q REND="inline">"And '&s;ins of <HI>moment'</HI> is a faulty expre&s;&s;ion;

Mere poets know no more of fundamental principles than&mdash;"</Q> Here he was interrupted &s;omehow. Mrs. Thrale mentioned Dryden. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"He puzzled him&s;elf about prede&s;tination.&mdash;How fooli&s;h was it in Pope to give all his friend&s;hip to Lords, who thought they honoured him by being with him; and to choo&s;e &s;uch Lords as Burlington, and Cobham, and Bolingbroke? Bathur&s;t was negative, a plea&s;ing man; and I have heard no ill of Marchmont: and then always &s;ay|ing, 'I do not value you for being a Lord;' which was a &s;ure proof that he did. I never &s;ay, I do not value Bo&s;well more for being born to an e&s;tate, becau&s;e I do not care."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Nor for being a Scotchman?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, I do value you more for being a Scotchman. You are a Scotchman without the faults of Scotchmen. You would not have been &s;o valuable as you are, had you not been a Scotchman."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of divorces, I a&s;ked if Othello's doctrine was not plau&s;ible:
<Q><L>"He who is robb'd, not wanting what is &s;tolen,</L>
<L>"Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all."</L></Q>
Dr. John&s;on and Mrs. Thrale joined again&s;t this. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"A&s;k any man if he'd wi&s;h not to know of &s;uch an injury."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Would you tell your friend to make him unhappy?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Perhaps, Sir, I &s;hould not; but that would be from prudence on my own account. A man would tell his father."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Yes; becau&s;e he would not have &s;purious children to get any &s;hare of the family inheritance."</Q> MRS. THRALE. <Q REND="inline">"Or he would tell his brother."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Certainly his <HI>elder</HI> brother."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"You would tell your friend of a woman's infamy, to prevent his marrying a whore: there is the &s;ame rea&s;on to tell him of his wife's infi|delity, when he is married, to prevent the con&s;equences of impo&s;ition. It is a breach of confidence not to tell a friend."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Would you tell Mr.&mdash;?"</Q> (naming a gentleman who a&s;&s;uredly was not in the lea&s;t danger of &s;uch a mi&s;erable di&s;grace, though married to a fine woman.) JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; becau&s;e it would do no good: he is &s;o &s;luggi&s;h, he'd never go to parliament and get through a divorce."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="265" MS="y">
He &s;aid of one of our friends, <Q REND="inline">"He is ruining him&s;elf without plea&s;ure.  A man who lo&s;es at play, or who runs out his fortune at court, makes his e&s;tate le&s;s, in hopes of making it bigger: (I am &s;ure of this word, which was often u&s;ed by him:) but it is a &s;ad thing to pa&s;s through the quagmire of par&s;imony, to the gulph of ruin. To pa&s;s over the flowery path of extravagance is very well."</Q></P>
<P>Among&s;t the numerous prints pa&s;ted on the walls of the dining-room at Streatham, was Hogarth's <Q REND="inline">"Modern Midnight Conver&s;ation."</Q> I a&s;ked him what he knew of Par&s;on Ford, who makes a con&s;picuous figure in the riotous groupe. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he was my acquaintance and relation, my mother's nephew. He had purcha&s;ed a living in the country, but not &s;imoniacally. I never &s;aw him but in the country. I have been told he was a man of great parts; very profligate, but I never heard he was impious."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Was there not a &s;tory of his gho&s;t having appeared?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it was believed. A waiter at the Hummums, in which hou&s;e Ford died, had been ab&s;ent for &s;ome time, and returned, not knowing that Ford was dead. Going down to the cellar, according to the &s;tory, he met him; going down again he met him a &s;econd time. When he came up, he a&s;ked &s;ome of the people of the hou&s;e what Ford could be doing there. They told him Ford was dead. The waiter took a fever, in which he lay for &s;ome time. When he recovered, he &s;aid he had a me&s;&s;age to deliver to &s;ome women from Ford; but he was not to tell what, or to whom. He walked out; he was followed; but &s;omewhere about St. Paul's they lo&s;t him. He came back, and &s;aid he had delivered the me&s;&s;age, and the women exclaimed, 'Then we are all undone!' Dr. Pellet, who was not a credulous man, inquired into the truth of this &s;tory, and he &s;aid, the evidence was irre&s;i&s;tible. My wife went to the Hummums; (it is a place where people get them&s;elves cupped.) I believe &s;he went with intention to hear about this &s;tory of Ford. At fir&s;t they made difficulty to tell her; but, after they had talked to her, &s;he came away &s;atisfied that it was true. To be &s;ure, the man had a fever; and this vi&s;ion may have been the beginning of it. But if the me&s;&s;age to the women, and their behaviour upon it were true as related, there was &s;omething &s;upernatural. That re&s;ts upon his word; and there it remains."</Q></P>
<P>After Mrs. Thrale was gone to bed, John&s;on and I &s;at up late. We re&s;umed Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's argument on Sunday la&s;t, that a man would be virtuous though he had no other motive than to pre&s;erve his character. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is not true: for as to this world vice does not hurt a man's character."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; debauching a friend's wife will."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No,
<PB N="264" REF="266" MS="y">
 Sir. Who thinks the wor&s;e of&mdash;for it?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Lord&mdash;was not his friend."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"That is only a circum&s;tance, Sir; a &s;light di&s;tinction. He could not get into the hou&s;e but by Lord&mdash;. A man is cho&s;en Knight of the &s;hire, not the le&s;s for having debauched ladies."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"What, Sir, if he debauched the ladies of gentlemen in the county, will not there be a general re&s;entment again&s;t him?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir. He will lo&s;e tho&s;e particular gentlemen; but the re&s;t will not trouble their heads about it."</Q> (warmly.) BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, I cannot think &s;o."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, there is no talking with a man who will di&s;pute what every body knows. (angrily.) Don't you know this?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; and I wi&s;h to think better of your country than you repre&s;ent it. I knew in Scotland a gentleman obliged to leave it for debauching a lady; and in one of our counties an Earl's brother lo&s;t his election, becau&s;e he had debauched the lady of another Earl in that county, and broken the peace of a noble family."</Q></P>
<P>Still he would not yield. He proceeded: <Q REND="inline">"Will you not allow, Sir, that vice does not hurt a man's character &s;o as to ob&s;truct his pro&s;perity in life, when you know that&mdash;was loaded with wealth and honours; a man who had acquired his fortune by &s;uch crimes, that his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of them impelled him to cut his own throat."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"You will recollect, Sir, that Dr. Robert&s;on &s;aid, he cut his throat becau&s;e he was weary of &s;till life; little things not being &s;ufficient to move his great mind."</Q> JOHNSON. (very angry) <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, what &s;tuff is this? You had no more this opinion after Robert&s;on &s;aid it, than before. I know nothing more offen&s;ive than repeating what one knows to be fooli&s;h things, by way of continuing a di&s;pute, to &s;ee what a man will an&s;wer, to make him your butt!"</Q> (angrier &s;till.) BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir, I had no &s;uch intention as you &s;eem to &s;u&s;pect; I had not indeed. Might not this nobleman have felt every thing 'weary, &s;tale, flat, and unprofitable,' as Hamlet &s;ays?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, if you are to bring in gabble, I'll talk no more. I will not, upon my honour."</Q> My readers will decide upon this di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Next morning I &s;tated to Mrs. Thrale at breakfa&s;t, before he came down, the di&s;pute of la&s;t night as to the influence of character upon &s;ucce&s;s in life. She &s;aid he was certainly wrong; and told me, that a Baronet lo&s;t an election in Wales, becau&s;e he had debauched the &s;i&s;ter of a gentleman in the county, whom he made one of his daughters invite as her companion at his &s;eat in the country, when his lady and his other children were in London. But &s;he would not encounter John&s;on upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="267" MS="y">
I &s;taid all this day with him at Streatham. He talked a great deal, in  very good humour.</P>
<P>Looking at Me&s;&s;rs. Dillys' &s;plendid edition of Lord Che&s;terfield's mi&s;cella|neous works, he laughed, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Here now are two &s;peeches a&s;cribed to him, both of which were written by me: and the be&s;t of it is, they have found out that one is like Demo&s;thenes, and the other like Cicero."</Q></P>
<P>He cen&s;ured Lord Kames's <Q REND="inline">"Sketches of the Hi&s;tory of Man,"</Q> for mi&s;|repre&s;enting Clarendon's account of the appearance of Sir George Villiers's gho&s;t, as if Clarendon were weakly credulous; when the truth is, that Clarendon only &s;ays, that the &s;tory was upon a better foundation of credit, than u&s;ually &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es are founded upon, nay, &s;peaks thus of the per&s;on who was reported to have &s;een the vi&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"the poor man, <HI>if he had been at all waking;</HI>"</Q> which Lord Kames has omitted. He added, <Q REND="inline">"in this book it is maintained that virtue is natural to man, and that if we would but con&s;ult our own hearts we &s;hould be virtuous. Now after con&s;ulting our own hearts all we can, and with all the helps we have, we find how few of us are virtuous. This is &s;aying a thing which all mankind know not to be true."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Is not mode&s;ty natural?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I cannot &s;ay, Sir, as we find no people quite in a &s;tate of nature; but I think the more they are taught, the more mode&s;t they are. The French are a gro&s;s, ill-bred, untaught people; a lady there will &s;pit on the floor and rub it with her foot. What I gained by being in France was, learning to be better &s;atisfied with my own country. Time may be employed to more advantage from nineteen to twenty-four almo&s;t in any way than in travelling; when you &s;et travelling again&s;t mere negation, again&s;t doing nothing, it is better to be &s;ure; but how much more would a young man improve were he to &s;tudy during tho&s;e years. Indeed, if a young man is wild, and mu&s;t run after women and bad company, it is better this &s;hould be done abroad, as, on his return, he can break off &s;uch connections, and begin at home a new man, with a character to form, and acquaintances to make. How little does travelling &s;upply to the conver&s;ation of any man who has travelled? how little to Beauclerk?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"What &s;ay you to Lord&mdash;?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I never but once heard him talk of what he had &s;een, and that was of a large &s;erpent in one of the Pyramids of Egypt."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Well, I happened to hear him tell the &s;ame thing, which made me mention him."</Q></P>
<P>I talked of a country life.&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Were I to live in the country I would not devote my&s;elf to the acqui&s;ition of popularity; I would live in a much better way, much more happily; I would have my time at my own command."</Q>
<PB N="266" REF="268" MS="y">
 BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, is it not a &s;ad thing to be at a di&s;tance from all our literary friends?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you will by and by have enough of this conver&s;ation, which now delights you &s;o much."</Q></P>
<P>As he was a zealous friend of &s;ubordination, he was at all times watchful to repre&s;s the vulgar cant again&s;t the manners of the great; <Q REND="inline">"High people, Sir, (&s;aid he,) are the be&s;t; take a hundred ladies of quality, you'll find them better wives, better mothers, more willing to &s;acrifice their own plea&s;ure to their children, than a hundred other women. Trade&s;women (I mean the wives of trade&s;men) in the city, who are worth from ten to fifteen thou&s;and pounds, are the wor&s;t creatures upon the earth, gro&s;sly ignorant, and thinking viciou&s;|ne&s;s fa&s;hionable. Farmers, I think, are often worthle&s;s fellows. Few lords will cheat; and, if they do, they'll be a&s;hamed of it: farmers cheat and are not a&s;hamed of it: they have all the &s;en&s;ual vices too of the nobility, with cheating into the bargain. There is as much fornication and adultery among&s;t farmers as among&s;t noblemen."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"The notion of the world, Sir, however is, that the morals of women of quality are wor&s;e than tho&s;e in lower &s;tations."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of one woman of quality makes more noi&s;e than that of a number of women in lower &s;tations; then, Sir, you are to con&s;ider the malignity of women in the city again&s;t women of quality, which will make them believe any thing of them, &s;uch as that they call their coachmen to bed. No, Sir, &s;o far as I have ob&s;erved, the higher in rank, the richer ladies are, they are the better in&s;tructed and the more virtuous."</Q></P>
<P>This year the Reverend Mr. Horne publi&s;hed his <Q REND="inline">"Letter to Mr. Dunning, on the Engli&s;h Particle;</Q> John&s;on read it, and though not treated in it with &s;ufficient re&s;pect, he had candour enough to &s;ay to Mr. Seward, <Q REND="inline">"Were I to make a new edition of my Dictionary, I would adopt &s;everal<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">In Mr. Horne Tooke's enlargement of that <Q REND="inline">"Letter,"</Q> which ho has &s;ince publi&s;hed with the title of <Q REND="inline">"<GAP DESC="foreign">; or, the Diver&s;ions of Purley;"</Q> he mentions this compliment, as if Dr. John&s;on in&s;tead of <HI>&s;everal</HI> of his etymologies had &s;aid <HI>all.</HI> His recollection having thus magnified it, &s;hews how ambitious he was of the approbation of &s;o great a man.</NOTE> of Mr. Horne's etymologies; I hope they did not put the dog in the pillory for his libel; he has too much literature for that."</Q></P>
<P>On Saturday, May 16, I dined with him at Mr. Beauclerk's, with Mr. Langton, Mr. Steevens, Dr. Higgins, and &s;ome others.

<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Dr. Mead lived more in the broad &s;un-&s;hine of life than almo&s;t any man."</Q></P>
<P>The di&s;a&s;ter of General Burgoyne's army was then the common topick of conver&s;ation. It was a&s;ked why piling their arms was in&s;i&s;ted upon as a matter of &s;uch con&s;equence, when it &s;eemed to be a circum&s;tance &s;o incon|&s;iderable in it&s;elf. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, a French authour &s;ays, <HI>'Il y a beaucoup de puerilit&eacute;s dans la guerre.'</HI> All di&s;tinctions are trifles, becau&s;e great things can &s;eldom occur, and tho&s;e di&s;tinctions are &s;ettled by cu&s;tom.

<P>He this day made the ob&s;ervations upon the &s;imilarity between <Q REND="inline">"Ra&s;&s;elas"</Q> and <Q REND="inline">"Candide,"</Q> which I have in&s;ert&eacute;d in its proper place, when con&s;idering his admirable philo&s;ophical Romance.

<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"The lyrical part of Horace never can be perfectly tran&s;lated; &s;o much of the excellence is in the numbers and the expre&s;&s;ion. Francis has done it the be&s;t; I'll take his, five out of &s;ix, again&s;t them all."</Q></P>
<P>On Sunday, May 17, I pre&s;ented to him Mr. Fullarton, of Fullarton, who has &s;ince di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf &s;o much in India, to whom he naturally talked of travels, as Mr. Brydone accompanied him in his tour to Sicily and Malta.

<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Lord Chatham was a Dictator; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power of putting the State in motion; now there is no power, all order is relaxed."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Is there no hope of a change to the better?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, yes, Sir, when we are weary of this relaxation.

<P>On Tue&s;day, May 19, I was to &s;et out for Scotland in the evening. He was engaged to dine with me at Mr. Dilly's, I waited upon him to remind him of his appointment and attend him thither; he gave me &s;ome &s;alutary coun&s;el, and recommended vigorous re&s;olution again&s;t any deviation from moral duty. BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But you would not have me to bind my&s;elf by a &s;olemn obligation?"</Q> JOHNSON. (much agitated) <Q REND="inline">"What! a vow&mdash;O, no, Sir, a vow is a horrible thing, it is a &s;nare for &s;in. The man who cannot go to Heaven without a vow&mdash;may go&mdash;"</Q> Here, &s;tanding erect, in the middle of his library, and rolling grand, his pau&s;e was truly a curious compound of the &s;olemn and the ludicrous; he half-whi&s;tled in his u&s;ual way, when plea&s;ant, and he pau&s;ed, as if checked by religious awe.&mdash;Methought he would have added&mdash;to Hell&mdash;but was re&s;trained. I humoured the dilemma. <Q REND="inline">"What! Sir, (&s;aid I,) <HI>'In coelum ju&s;&s;eris ibit;</HI>"</Q> alluding to his imitation of it,
<Q><L>"And bid him go to Hell, to Hell he goes."</L></Q></P>
<P>I had mentioned to him a &s;light fault in his noble <Q REND="inline">"Imitation of the Tenth Satire of Juvenal,"</Q> a too near recurrence of the verb <HI>&s;pread,</HI> in his de&s;cription of the young Enthu&s;ia&s;t at College:</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>He had de&s;ired me to change <HI>&s;preads</HI> to <HI>burns,</HI> but for perfect authenticity, I now had it done with his own hand <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">The &s;lip of paper on which he made the correction, is depo&s;ited by me in the noble library to which it relates, and to which I have pre&s;ented other pieces of his hand-writing.</NOTE>.

<P>We had a quiet comfortable meeting at Mr. Dilly's; nobody there but our&s;elves, Mr. Dilly mentioned &s;omebody having wi&s;hed that Milton's <Q REND="inline">"Tractate on Education"</Q> &s;hould be printed along with his Poems in the

So far as it would be any thing it would be wrong. Education in England has been in danger of being hurt by two of its greate&s;t men, Milton and Locke. Milton's plan is impracticable, and I &s;uppo&s;e has never been tried. Locke's, I fancy has been tried often enough; but is very imperfect, it gives too much to one &s;ide, and too little to the other; it gives too little to literature. I &s;hall do what I can for Dr. Watts; but my materials are very &s;canty.

<P>John&s;on maintained a long and intimate friend&s;hip with Mr. Welch, who &s;ucceeded the celebrated Henry Fielding as one of his Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;tices of the Peace for We&s;tmin&s;ter; kept a regular office for the police of that great di&s;trict; and di&s;charged his important tru&s;t, for many years, faithfully and ably. John&s;on, who had an eager and uncea&s;ing curio&s;ity to know human life in all its variety, told me, that he attended Mr. Welch in his office for a whole winter, to hear the examinations of the culprits; but that he found an almo&s;t uniform tenor of misfortune, wretchedne&s;s, and profligacy. Mr. Welch's health being impaired, he was advi&s;ed to try the effect of a warm climate; and John&s;on, by his intere&s;t with Mr. Chamier, procured him leave of ab&s;ence to go to Italy, and a promi&s;e that the pen&s;ion or &s;alary of two hundred pounds a year, which Government allowed him, &s;hould not be di&s;continued. Mr. Welch accordingly went abroad, accompanied by his daughter Anne, a young lady of uncommon talents and literature. I have been fortunate enough, as this work was pa&s;&s;ing through the pre&s;s, to obtain the following letter; which, although the fir&s;t part of my narrative of this year was printed off before I received it, will now come in with very little deviation from chronological order.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO have &s;uffered one of my be&s;t and deare&s;t friends to pa&s;s almo&s;t two years in foreign countries without a letter, has a very &s;hameful appear|ance of inattention. But the truth is, that there was no particular time in
<PB N="270" REF="272">
 which I had any thing particular to &s;ay; and general expre&s;&s;ions of good will, I hope, our long friend&s;hip is grown too &s;olid to want.</P>
<P>Of publick affairs you have information from the news-papers where|ever you go, for the Engli&s;h keep no &s;ecret; and of other things, Mrs. Nollekens informs you. My intelligence could therefore be of no u&s;e; and Mi&s;s Nancy's letters made it unnece&s;&s;ary to write to you for information: I was likewi&s;e for &s;ome time out of humour, to find that motion, and nearer approaches to the &s;un, did not re&s;tore your health &s;o fa&s;t as I expected. Of your health, the accounts have lately been more plea&s;ing; and I have the gratification of imaging to my&s;elf a length of years which I hope you have gained, and of which the enjoyment will be improved, by a va&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of images and ob&s;ervations which your journeys and various re&s;idence have enabled you to make and accumulate. You have travelled with this felicity, almo&s;t peculiar to your&s;elf, that your companion is not to part from you at your journey's end; but you are to live on together, to help each other's recollection, and to &s;upply each other's omi&s;&s;ions. The world has few greater plea&s;ures than that which two friends enjoy, in tracing back, at &s;ome di&s;tant time, tho&s;e tran&s;actions and events through which they have pa&s;&s;ed together. One of the old man's mi&s;eries is, that he cannot ea&s;ily find a companion able to partake with him of the pa&s;t. You and your fellow-traveller have this comfort in &s;tore, that your conver&s;ation will be not ea&s;ily exhau&s;ted; one will always be glad to &s;ay what the other will always be willing to hear.</P>
<P>That you may enjoy this plea&s;ure long, your health mu&s;t have your con&s;tant attention. I &s;uppo&s;e you purpo&s;e to return this year. There is no need of ha&s;te: do not come hither before the heighth of &s;ummer, that you may fall gradually into the inconveniences of your native climate. July &s;eems to be the proper month. Augu&s;t and September will prepare you for the winter. After having travelled &s;o far to find health, you mu&s;t take care not to lo&s;e it at home; and I hope a little care will effectually pre|&s;erve it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Nancy has doubtle&s;s kept a con&s;tant and copious journal. She mu&s;t not expect to be welcome when &s;he returns without a great ma&s;s of information. Let her review her journal often, and &s;et down what &s;he finds her&s;elf to have omitted, that &s;he may tru&s;t to memory as little as po&s;&s;ible, for memory is &s;oon confu&s;ed by a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of things; and &s;he will grow every day le&s;s confident of the truth of her own narratives, unle&s;s &s;he can recur to &s;ome written memorials. If &s;he has &s;atisfied her&s;elf with hints, in&s;tead of full repre&s;entations, let her &s;upply the deficiencies now while her memory is yet
<PB N="271" REF="273">
fre&s;h, and while her father's memory may help her. If &s;he ob&s;erves this  direction, &s;he will not have travelled in vain; for &s;he will bring home a book with which &s;he may entertain her&s;elf to the end of life. If it were not now too late, I would advi&s;e her to note the impre&s;&s;ion which the fir&s;t &s;ight of any thing new and wonderful made upon her mind. Let her now &s;et her thoughts down as &s;he can recollect them; for faint as they may already be, they will grow every day fainter.</P>
<P>Perhaps I do not flatter my&s;elf unrea&s;onably when I imagine that you may wi&s;h to know &s;omething of me. I can gratify your benevolence with no account of health. The hand of time, or of di&s;ea&s;e, is very heavy upon me. I pa&s;s re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y nights, harra&s;&s;ed with convul&s;ions of my brea&s;t, and flatulencies at my &s;tomach; and re&s;tle&s;s nights make heavy days. But nothing will be mended by complaints, and therefore I will make an end. When we meet, we will try to forget our cares and our maladies, and contribute, as we can, to the cheerfulne&s;s of each other. If I had gone with you, I believe I &s;hould have been better; but I do not know that it was in my power.</P>

<P>SINCE my return to Scotland, I have been again at Lanark, and have had more conver&s;ation with Thom&s;on's &s;i&s;ter. It is &s;trange that Murdoch, who was his intimate friend, &s;hould have mi&s;taken his mother's maiden name, which he &s;ays was Hume, whereas Hume was the name of his grand|mother by the mother's &s;ide. His mother's name was Beatrix Trotter <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Dr. John&s;on was by no means attentive to minute accuracy in his <Q REND="inline">"Lives of the Poets;"</Q> for notwith&s;tanding my having detected this mi&s;take, he has continued it.</NOTE>, a daughter of Mr. Trotter, of Fogo, a &s;mall proprietor of land. Thom&s;on had one brother, whom he had with him in England as his amanuen&s;is; but he was &s;eized with a con&s;umption, and having returned to Scotland, to try what his native air would do for him, died young. He had three &s;i&s;ters, one married to Mr. Bell, mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h of Strathaven; one to Mr. Craig, father of the ingenious architect, who gave the plan of the New Town of Edinburgh; and one to Mr. Thom&s;on, ma&s;ter of the grammar-&s;chool at Lanark. He was of a humane and benevolent di&s;po&s;ition; not only &s;ent valuable pre&s;ents to his &s;i&s;ters, but an yearly allowance in money, and was always wi&s;hing to have it in his power to do them more good. Lord Lyttelton's ob&s;ervation, that <Q REND="inline">'he lothed much to write,'</Q> was very true. His letters to his &s;i&s;ter, Mrs. Thom&s;on, were not frequent, and in one of them he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">'All my friends who know me, know how backward I am to write letters; and never impute the negligence of my hand to the coldne&s;s of my heart.'</Q> I &s;end you a copy of the la&s;t letter which &s;he had from him; &s;he never heard that he had any intention of going into holy orders.

Mr. Langton has been plea&s;ed, at my reque&s;t, to favour me with &s;ome  particulars of Dr. John&s;on's vi&s;it to Warley-Camp, where this gentleman was at the time &s;tationed, as a Captain in the Lincoln&s;hire militia. I &s;hall give them in his own words in a letter to me.</P>
<Q><P>It was in the &s;ummer of the year 1778, that he complied with my invitation to come down to the Camp at Warley, and he &s;taid with me about a week; the &s;cene appeared, notwith&s;tanding a great degree of ill health that he &s;eemed to labour under, to intere&s;t and amu&s;e him, as agreeing with the di&s;|po&s;ition that I believe you know he con&s;tantly manife&s;ted towards enquiring into &s;ubjects of the military kind. He &s;ate, with a patient degree of attention, to ob&s;erve the proceedings of a regimental court-martial, that happened to be called in the time of his &s;tay with us; and one night, as late as at eleven o'clock, he accompanied the Major of the regiment in going what are &s;tyled, the <HI>Rounds;</HI> where he might ob&s;erve the forms of vi&s;iting the guards, for the &s;eeing that they and their &s;entries are ready in their duty on their &s;everal po&s;ts. He took occa&s;ion to conver&s;e at times on military topicks, one in particular, that I &s;ee the mention of, in your 'Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,' which lies open before me <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Third Edition, p. 111.</NOTE>, as to gun-powder; which he &s;poke of to the &s;ame effect, in part, that you relate.</P>
<P>On one occa&s;ion, when the regiment were going through their exerci&s;e, he went quite clo&s;e to the men at one of the extremities of it, and watched all their practices attentively; and, when he came away, his remark was, <Q REND="inline">'The men indeed do load their mu&s;quets and fire with wonderful celerity.'</Q> He was likewi&s;e particular in requiring to know what was the weight of the mu&s;quet-balls in u&s;e, and within what di&s;tance they might be expected to take effect when fired off.</P>
<P>In walking among the tents, and ob&s;erving the difference between tho&s;e of the officers and private men, he &s;aid that the &s;uperiority of accommoda|tion of the better conditions of life, to that of the inferiour ones, was never exhibited to him in &s;o di&s;tinct a view. The civilities paid to him in the camp were, from the gentlemen of the Lincoln&s;hire regiment, one of the officers of which accommodated him with a tent in which he &s;lept; and from General Hall, who very courteou&s;ly invited him to dine with him, where he appeared to be very well plea&s;ed with his entertainment, and the civilities he

<P>I HAVE received two letters from you, of which the &s;econd com|plains of the neglect &s;hown to the fir&s;t. You mu&s;t not tye your friends to &s;uch punctual corre&s;pondence. You have all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;urances of my affec|tion and e&s;teem; and there ought to be no need of reiterated profe&s;&s;ions. When it may happen that I can give you either coun&s;el or comfort, I hope it will never happen to me that I &s;hould neglect you; but you mu&s;t not think me criminal or cold if I &s;ay nothing, when I have nothing to &s;ay.</P>
<P>You are now happy enough. Mrs. Bo&s;well is recovered; and I con|gratulate you upon the probability of her long life. If general approbation will add any thing to your enjoyment, I can tell you that I have heard you mentioned as <HI>a man whom every body likes.</HI> I think life has little more to give.</P>
<P>&mdash;has gone to his regiment. He has laid down his coach, and talks of making more contractions of his expence: how he will &s;ucceed I know not. It is difficult to reform a hou&s;ehold gradually; it may be better done by a &s;y&s;tem totally new. I am afraid he has always &s;omething to hide. When we pre&s;&s;ed him to go to&mdash;, he objected the nece&s;&s;ity of attend|ing his navigation; yet he could talk of going to Aberdeen, a place not much nearer his navigation. I believe he cannot bear the thought of living at&mdash;in a &s;tate of diminution; and of appearing among the gentlemen of the neighbourhood <HI>&s;horn of his beams.</HI> This is natural, but it is cowardly. What I told him of the encrea&s;ing expence of a growing family &s;eems to have &s;truck him. He certainly had gone on with very confu&s;ed views, and we have, I think, &s;hown him that he is wrong; though, with the com|mon deficience of advi&s;ers, we have not &s;hown him how to do right.</P>

I wi&s;h you would a little correct or re&s;train your imagination, and  imagine that happine&s;s, &s;uch as life admits, may be had at other places as well as London.

<P>I do not blame your preference of London to other places, for it is really to be preferred, if the choice is free; but few have the choice of their place, or their manner of life; and mere plea&s;ure ought not to be the prime motive of action.</P>

<P>GARRICK's death is a &s;triking event; not that we &s;hould be &s;urpri&s;ed with the death of any man, who has lived &s;ixty-two years.

</LETTER>
<P>This letter cro&s;&s;ed me on the road to London, where I arrived on Monday, March 15, and next morning at a late hour, found Dr. John&s;on &s;itting over
<PB N="282" REF="284" MS="y">
 his tea, attended by Mrs. De&s;moulins, Mr. Levett, and a clergyman, who had come to &s;ubmit &s;ome poetical pieces to his revi&s;ion. It is wonderful what a number and variety of writers, &s;ome of them even unknown to him, prevailed on his good-nature to look over their works, and &s;ugge&s;t corrections and improvements. My arrival interrupted for a little while, the important bu&s;ine&s;s of this true repre&s;entative of Bayes; upon its being re&s;umed, I found that the &s;ubject under immediate con&s;ideration was a tran&s;lation, yet in manu&s;cript, of the <HI>Carmen Seculare</HI> of Horace, which had this year been &s;et to mu&s;ick, and performed as a publick entertainment in London, for the joint benefit of Mon&s;ieur Philidor and Signor Baretti. When John&s;on had done reading, the authour a&s;ked him bluntly, <Q REND="inline">"If upon the whole it was a good tran&s;lation?"</Q> John&s;on, who&s;e regard for truth was uncommonly &s;trict, &s;eemed to be puzzled for a moment, what an&s;wer to make, as he certainly could not hone&s;tly commend the performance: with exqui&s;ite addre&s;s he evaded the que&s;tion thus, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I do not &s;ay that it may not be made a very good tran&s;lation."</Q> Here nothing whatever in favour of the performance was affirmed, and yet the writer was not &s;hocked. A printed <Q REND="inline">"Ode to the Warlike Genius of Britain,"</Q> came next in review; the bard was a lank bony figure, with &s;hort black hair; he was writhing him&s;elf in agitation, while John&s;on read, and &s;hewing his teeth in a grin of earne&s;tne&s;s, exclaimed in broken &s;entences, and in a keen &s;harp tone, <Q REND="inline">"Is that poetry, Sir?&mdash;Is it Pindar?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, there is here a great deal of what is called poetry."</Q> Then turning to me, the poet cried, <Q REND="inline">"My mu&s;e has not been long upon the town, and (pointing to the Ode) it trembles under the hand of the great critick."</Q> John&s;on in a tone of di&s;plea&s;ure a&s;ked him, <Q REND="inline">"Why do you prai&s;e An&s;on?"</Q> I did not trouble him by a&s;king his rea&s;on for this que&s;tion. He proceeded, <Q REND="inline">"Here is an errour, Sir; you have made Genius feminine."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Palpable, Sir; (cried the enthu&s;ia&s;t) I know it. But (in a lower tone) it was to pay a compliment to the Duche&s;s of Devon&s;hire, with which her Grace was plea&s;ed. She is walking acro&s;s Coxheath, in the military uniform, and I &s;uppo&s;e her to be the Genius of Britain."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir you are giving a rea&s;on for it, but that will not make it right. You may have a rea&s;on why two and two &s;hould make five; but they will &s;till make but four."</Q></P>
<P>Although I was &s;everal times with him in the cour&s;e of the following days, &s;uch it &s;eems were my occupations, or &s;uch my negligence, that I have pre&s;erved no memorial of his conver&s;ation till Friday, March 26, when I vi&s;ited him. He &s;aid he expected to be attacked on account of his
<PB N="283" REF="285" MS="y">
<Q REND="inline">"Lives of the Poets."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"However (&s;aid he) I would rather be attacked  than unnoticed. For the wor&s;t thing you can do to an authour is to be &s;ilent as to his works. An a&s;&s;ault upon a town is a bad thing; but &s;tarving it is &s;till wor&s;e; an a&s;&s;ault may be un&s;ucce&s;sful; you may have more men killed than you kill; but if you &s;tarve the town you are &s;ure of a victory."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of a friend of our's a&s;&s;ociating with per&s;ons of very di&s;cordant principles and characters; I &s;aid he was a very univer&s;al man, quite a man of the world. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; but one may be &s;o much a man of the world as to be nothing in the world. I remember a pa&s;&s;age in Gold&s;mith's 'Vicar of Wakefield,' which he was afterwards fool enough to expunge: 'I do not love a man who is zealous for nothing."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"That was a fine pa&s;&s;age."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir: there was another fine pa&s;&s;age too, which he &s;truck out: 'When I was a young man, being anxious to di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf, I was perpetually &s;tarting new propo&s;itions. But I &s;oon gave this over; for, I found that generally what was new was fal&s;e."</Q> I &s;aid I did not like to &s;it with people of whom I had not a good opinion. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But you mu&s;t not indulge your delicacy too much; or you will be a <HI>t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te</HI> man all your life."</Q></P>
<P>During my &s;tay in London, this &s;pring, I find I was unaccountably negli|gent in pre&s;erving John&s;on's &s;ayings, more &s;o than at any time when I was happy enough to have an opportunity of hearing his wi&s;dom and wit. There is no help for it now. I mu&s;t content my&s;elf with pre&s;enting &s;uch &s;craps as I have. But I am neverthele&s;s a&s;hamed and vexed to think how much has been lo&s;t. It is not that there was a bad crop this year; but that I was not &s;ufficiently careful in gathering it in. I, therefore, in &s;ome in&s;tances can only exhibit a few detached fragments.</P>
<P>Talking of the wonderful concealment of the authour of the celebrated letters &s;igned <HI>Junius;</HI> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould have believed Burke to be Junius, becau&s;e I know no man but Burke who is capable of writing the&s;e letters; but Burke &s;pontaneou&s;ly denied it to me. The ca&s;e would have been different had I a&s;ked him if he was the authour; a man &s;o que&s;tioned, as to an anonymous publication, may think he has a right to deny it.</Q></P>
<P>He ob&s;erved that his old friend, Mr. Sheridan, had been honoured with extraordinary attention in his own country, by having had an exception made in his favour in an Iri&s;h Act of Parliament concerning in&s;olvent debtors. <Q REND="inline">"To be thus &s;ingled out (&s;aid he) by a legi&s;lature, as an object of publick con&s;ideration and kindne&s;s, is a proof of no common merit."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="286" MS="y">
 At Streatham, on Monday, March 29, at breakfa&s;t he maintained that a&punc; father had no right to control the inclinations of his daughters in marriage.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, March 31, when I vi&s;ited him, and confe&s;&s;ed an exce&s;s of which I had very &s;eldom been guilty; that I had &s;pent a whole night in play|ing at cards, and that I could not look back on it with &s;atisfaction. In&s;tead of a har&s;h animadver&s;ion, he mildly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Alas, Sir, on how few things can we look back with &s;atisfaction."</Q></P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, April 1, he commended one of the Dukes of Devon&s;hire for <Q REND="inline">"a dogged veracity <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See p. 165 of this Volume.</NOTE>."</Q> He &s;aid too, <Q REND="inline">"London is nothing to &s;ome peoples&punc; but to a man who&s;e plea&s;ure is intellectual, London is the place. And there is no place where oeconomy can be &s;o well practi&s;ed as in London. More can be had here for the money, even by ladies, than any where el&s;e. You cannot play tricks with your fortune in a &s;mall place; you mu&s;t make an uniform appearance. Here a lady may have well-furni&s;hed apartments, and elegant dre&s;s, without any meat in her kitchen."</Q></P>
<P>I was amu&s;ed by con&s;idering with how much ea&s;e and coolne&s;s he could write or talk to a friend, exhorting him not to &s;uppo&s;e that happine&s;s was not to be found as well in other places as in London; when he him&s;elf was at all times &s;en&s;ible of its being, comparatively &s;peaking, a heaven upon earth. The truth is, that by tho&s;e who from &s;agacity, attention, and experience, have learnt the full advantage of London, its pre-eminence over every other place, not only for variety of enjoyment, but for comfort, will be&punc;felt with a philo|&s;ophical exultation. The freedom from remark and petty cen&s;ure, with which life may be pa&s;&s;ed there, is a circircum&s;tance which a man who knows the teizing re&s;traint of a narrow circle mu&s;t reli&s;h highly. Mr. Burke, who&s;e orderly and amiable dome&s;tick habits might make the eye of ob&s;ervation le&s;s irk&s;ome to him than to mo&s;t men, &s;aid once very plea&s;antly, in my hearing, <Q REND="inline">"Though I have the honour to repre&s;ent Bri&s;tol, I &s;hould not like to live there; I &s;hould be obliged to be &s;o much <HI>upon my good behaviour:</HI>"</Q> In London, a man may live in &s;plendid &s;ociety at one time, and in frugal retire|ment another, without animadver&s;ion. There, and there alone, a man's own hou&s;e is truly his <HI>ca&s;tle,</HI> in which he can be in perfect &s;afety from intru&s;ion whenever he plea&s;es. I never &s;hall forget how well this was expre&s;&s;ed to me one day by Mr. Meynell: <Q REND="inline">"The chief advantage of London (&s;aid he) is, that a man is always <HI>&s;o near his burrow.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid of one of his old acquaintances, <Q REND="inline">"He is very fit for a travelling governour. He knows French very well. He is a man of good principles;
<PB N="285" REF="287" MS="y">
and there would be no danger that a young gentleman &s;hould catch his man|ner;  for it is &s;o very bad, that it mu&s;t be avoided. In that re&s;pect he would be like the drunken Helot."</Q></P>
<P>On Friday, April 2, being Good-Friday, I vi&s;ited him in the morning as u&s;ual; and finding that we in&s;en&s;ibly fell into a train of ridicule upon the foibles of one of our friends, a very worthy man, I, by way of a check, quoted &s;ome good admonition from <Q REND="inline">"The Government of the Tongue,"</Q> that very pious book. It happened al&s;o remarkably enough, that the &s;ubject of the &s;ermon preached to us to-day by Dr. Burrows, the rector of St. Clement Danes, upon the certainty that at the la&s;t day we mu&s;t give an account of <Q REND="inline">"the deeds done in the body;"</Q> and, among&s;t various acts of culpability he mentioned evil-&s;peaking. As we were moving &s;lowly along in the croud from church, John&s;on jogged my elbow, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Did you attend to the &s;ermon?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, (&s;aid I,) it was very applicable to <HI>us.</HI>"</Q> He, how|ever, &s;tood upon the defen&s;ive. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, the &s;en&s;e of ridicule is given us, and may be lawfully u&s;ed. The authour of 'The Government of the Tongue' would have us to treat all men alike."</Q></P>
<P>In the interval between morning and evening &s;ervice, he endeavoured to employ him&s;elf earne&s;tly in devotional exerci&s;es; and, as he has mentioned in his <Q REND="inline">"Prayers and Meditations <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Page 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>,"</Q> gave me <Q REND="inline">"Les Pen&s;ees de Pa&s;cal,"</Q> that I might not interrupt him. I pre&s;erve the book with reverence. His pre|&s;enting it to me is marked upon it with his own hand, and I have found in it a truly divine unction. We went to church again in the afternoon.</P>
<P>On Saturday, April 3, I vi&s;ited him at night, and found him &s;itting in Mrs. Williams's room, with her, and one who he afterwards told me was a natural &s;on of the &s;econd Lord Southwell. The table had a &s;ingular appearance, being covered with a heterogeneous a&s;&s;emblage of oy&s;ters and porter for his company, and tea for him&s;elf. I mentioned my having heard an eminent phy&s;ician, who was him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, argue in favour of univer&s;al toleration, and maintain, that no man could be hurt by another man's differing from him in opinion. JOHNSON <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you are to a certain degree hurt by knowing that even one man does not believe."</Q></P>
<P>On Ea&s;ter-day, after &s;olemn &s;ervice at St. Paul's, I dined with him: Mr. Allen the printer was al&s;o his gue&s;t. He was uncommonly &s;ilent; and I have not written down any thing, except a &s;ingle curious fact, which, having the &s;anction of his inflexible veracity, may be received as a &s;triking in&s;tance of human in&s;en&s;ibility and incon&s;ideration. As he was pa&s;&s;ing by a fi&s;h|monger
<PB N="286" REF="288" MS="y">
 who was &s;kinning an eel alive, he heard him <Q REND="inline">"cur&s;e it, becau&s;e it would not lye &s;till."</Q></P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, April 7, I dined with him at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's. I have not marked what company was there. John&s;on harangued upon the qualities of different liquors; and &s;poke with great contempt of claret, as &s;o weak, that <Q REND="inline">"a man would be drowned by it before it made him drunk."</Q> He was per&s;uaded to drink one gla&s;s of it, that he might judge, not from recollection, which might be dim, but from immediate &s;en&s;ation. He &s;hook his head, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Poor &s;tuff. No, Sir, claret is the liquor for boys; port, for men: but he who a&s;pires to be a hero (&s;miling) mu&s;t drink brandy. In the fir&s;t place, the flavour of brandy is mo&s;t grateful to the palate; and then brandy will do &s;oone&s;t for a man what drinking <HI>can</HI> do for him. There are, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ndeed, few who are able to drink brandy. That is a power rather to be wi&s;hed for than attained. And yet (proceeded he) as in all plea&s;ure hope is a con&s;iderable part, I know not but fruition comes too quick by brandy. Florence wine I think the wor&s;t; it is wine only to the eye; it is wine neither while you are drinking it, nor after you have drunk it; it neither plea&s;es the ta&s;te, nor exhilarates the &s;pirits."</Q> I reminded him how heartily he and I u&s;ed to drink wine together when we were fir&s;t acquainted; and how I u&s;ed to have a head-ache after &s;itting up with him. He did not like to have this recalled, or, perhaps, thinking that I boa&s;ted improperly, re&s;olved to have a witty &s;troke at me: <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, it was not the <HI>wine</HI> that made your head ache, but the <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> that I put into it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"What, Sir! will &s;en&s;e make the head ache?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, (with a &s;mile) when it is not u&s;ed to it."</Q> No man who has a true reli&s;h of plea&s;antry could be offended at this; e&s;pecially if John&s;on in a long intimacy had given him repeated proofs of his regard and good e&s;timation. I u&s;ed to &s;ay, that as he had given me a thou&s;and pounds in prai&s;e, he had a good right now and then to take a guinea from me.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, April 8, I dined with him at Mr. Allan Ram&s;ay's, with Lord Graham and &s;ome other company. We talked of Shak&s;peare's witches. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"They are beings of his own creation; they are a compound of malignity and meanne&s;s, without any abilities; and are quite different from the Italian magician. King James &s;ays, in his 'Daemonology,' 'Magicians command the devils; witches are their &s;ervants.' The Italian magicians are elegant beings."</Q> RAMSAY. <Q REND="inline">"Opera witches, not Drury-lane witches."</Q> John&s;on ob&s;erved, that abilities might be employed in a narrow &s;phere, as in
<PB N="287" REF="289" MS="y">
getting money, which he &s;aid he believed no man could do, without vigorous  parts, though concentrated to a point. RAMSAY. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, like a &s;trong hor&s;e in a mill: he pulls better."</Q></P>
<P>Lord Graham, while he prai&s;ed the beauty of Lochlomond, on the banks of which is his family &s;eat, complained of the climate, and &s;aid he could not bear it. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, my Lord, don't talk &s;o: you may bear it well enough. Your ance&s;tors have borne it more years than I can tell."</Q> This was a hand&s;ome compliment to the antiquity of the hou&s;e of Montro&s;e. His Lord|&s;hip told me afterwards, that he had only affected to complain of the climate; le&s;t, if he had &s;poken as favourably of his country as he really thought, Dr. John&s;on might have attacked it. John&s;on was very courteous to Lady Margaret Macdonald. <Q REND="inline">"Madam, (&s;aid he,) when I was in the I&s;le of Sky, I heard of the people running to take the &s;tones off the road, le&s;t Lady Margaret's hor&s;e &s;hould &s;tumble."</Q></P>
<P>Lord Graham commended Dr. Drummond at Naples, as a man of extra|ordinary talents; and added, that he had a great love of liberty. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"He is <HI>young,</HI> my Lord; (looking to his Lord&s;hip with an arch &s;mile) all <HI>boys</HI> love liberty, till experience convinces them they are not &s;o fit to govern them|&s;elves as they imagined. We are all agreed as to our own liberty; we would have as much of it as we can get; but we are not agreed as to the liberty of others: for in proportion as we take, others mu&s;t lo&s;e. I believe we hardly wi&s;h that the mob &s;hould have liberty to govern us. When that was the ca&s;e &s;ome time ago, no man was at liberty not to have candles in his windows."</Q> RAMSAY. <Q REND="inline">"The re&s;ult is, that order is better than confu&s;ion."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"The re&s;ult is, that order cannot be had but by &s;ubordination."</Q></P>
<P>On Friday, April 16, I had been pre&s;ent at the trial of the unfortunate Mr. Hackman, who, in a fit of frantick jealous love, had &s;hot Mi&s;s Ray, the favourite of a nobleman. John&s;on, in who&s;e company I dined to-day, with &s;ome other friends, was much intere&s;ted by my account of what pa&s;&s;ed, and particularly with his prayer for the mercy of heaven. He &s;aid, in a &s;olemn fervid tone, <Q REND="inline">"I hope he <HI>&s;hall</HI> find mercy."</Q></P>
<P>This day a violent altercation aro&s;e between John&s;on and Beauclerk, which having made much noi&s;e at the time, I think it proper, in order to prevent any future mi&s;repre&s;entation, to give a minute account of it.</P>
<P>In talking of Hackman, John&s;on argued, as Judge Black&s;tone had done, that his being furni&s;hed with two pi&s;tols was a proof that he meant to &s;hoot two per&s;ons. Mr. Beauclerk &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"No; for that every wi&s;e man who intended to &s;hoot him&s;elf, took two pi&s;tols, that he might be &s;ure of doing it
<PB N="288" REF="290" MS="y">
 at once. Lord&mdash;'s cook &s;hot him&s;elf with one pi&s;tol, and lived ten days in great agony. Mr.&mdash;, who loved buttered muffins, but dur&s;t not eat them becau&s;e they di&s;agreed with his &s;tomach, re&s;olved to &s;hoot him&s;elf; and then he eat three buttered muffins for breakfa&s;t, before &s;hooting him&s;elf, knowing that he &s;hould not be troubled with indige&s;tion: <HI>he</HI> had two charged pi&s;tols; one was found lying charged upon the table by him, after he had &s;hot him&s;elf with the other."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well, (&s;aid John&s;on, with an air of triumph,) you &s;ee here one pi&s;tol was &s;ufficient."</Q> Beauclerk replied &s;martly, <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e it happened to kill him."</Q> And either then, or a very little afterwards, being piqued at John&s;on's triumphant remark, added, <Q REND="inline">"This is what you don't know, and I do."</Q> There was then a ce&s;&s;ation of the di&s;pute; and &s;ome minutes intervened, during which, dinner and the gla&s;s went on cheerfully; when John&s;on &s;uddenly and abruptly exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Beauclerk, how came you to talk &s;o petulantly to me, as 'This is what you don't know, but what I know?' One thing <HI>I</HI> know which <HI>you</HI> don't &s;eem to know, that you are very uncivil."</Q> BEAUCLERK. <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e <HI>you</HI> began by being uncivil, (which you always are)."</Q> The words in parenthe&s;is were, I believe, not heard by Dr. John&s;on. Here again there was a ce&s;&s;ation of arms. John&s;on told me, that the rea&s;on why he waited &s;ome time at fir&s;t without taking any notice of what Mr. Beauclerk &s;aid, was becau&s;e he was thinking whether he &s;hould re&s;ent it. But when he con&s;idered that there were pre&s;ent a young Lord and an eminent traveller, two men of the world with whom he had never dined before, he was apprehen&s;ive that they might think they had a right to take &s;uch liberties with him as Beauclerk did, and therefore re&s;olved he would not let it pa&s;s; adding, that <Q REND="inline">"he would not appear a coward."</Q> A little while after this, the conver&s;ation turned on the violence of Hackman's temper. John&s;on then &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It was his bu&s;ine&s;s to <HI>command</HI> his temper, as my friend Mr. Beauclerk &s;hould have done &s;ome time time ago."</Q> BEAUCLERK. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould learn of <HI>you,</HI> Sir."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you have given <HI>me</HI> opportunities enough of learning, when I have been in <HI>your</HI> company. No man loves to be treated with contempt."</Q> BEAUCLERK. (with a polite inclination towards John&s;on) <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you have known me twenty years, and however I may have treated others, you may be &s;ure I could never treat you with contempt."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you have &s;aid more than was nece&s;&s;ary."</Q> Thus it ended; and Beauclerk's coach not having come for him till very late, Dr. John&s;on and another gentleman &s;at with him a long time after the re&s;t of the company were gone; and he and I dined at Beauclerk's on the Saturday &s;e'nnight following.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="291" MS="y">
After this tempe&s;t had &s;ub&s;ided, I recollect the following particulars of his  conver&s;ation:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am always for getting a boy forward in his learning; for that is a &s;ure good. I would let him at fir&s;t read <HI>any</HI> Engli&s;h book which happens to engage his attention; becau&s;e you have done a great deal when you have brought him to have entertainment from a book. He'll get better books afterwards."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mallet, I believe, never wrote a &s;ingle line of his projected Life of the Duke of Marlborough. He groped for materials; and thought of it, till he had exhau&s;ted his mind. Thus it &s;ometimes happens that men entangle them&s;elves in their own &s;chemes."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To be contradicted, in order to force you to talk, is mighty unplea&s;ing. You <HI>&s;hine,</HI> indeed; but it is by being <HI>ground.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Of a gentleman who made &s;ome figure among the <HI>Literati</HI> of his time, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"What eminence he had was by a felicity of manner: he had no more learning than what he could not help."</Q></P>
<P>On Saturday, April 24, I dined with him at Mr. Beauclerk's, with Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Mr. Jones, (now Sir William,) Mr. Langton, Mr. Steevens, Mr. Paradi&s;e, and Dr. Higgins. I mentioned that a Mr. Wilkes had attached Garrick to me, as a man who had no friend. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I believe he is right, Sir. <GAP DESC="foreign">.&mdash;He had friends, but no friend. Garrick was &s;o diffu&s;ed, he had no man to whom he wi&s;hed to unbo&s;om him&s;elf. He found people always ready to applaud him, and that always for the &s;ame thing: &s;o he &s;aw life with great uniformity."</Q> I took upon me, for once, to fight with Goliath's weapons, and play the &s;ophi&s;t.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Garrick did not need a friend, as he got from every body all he wanted. What is a friend? One who &s;upports you and comforts you, while others do not. Friend&s;hip, you know, Sir, is the cordial drop, 'to make the nau&s;eous draught of life go down:' but if the draught be not nau&s;eous, if it be all &s;weet, there is no occa&s;ion for that drop."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Many men would not be content to live &s;o. I hope I &s;hould not. They would wi&s;h to have an intimate friend, with whom they might compare minds, and cheri&s;h private virtues."</Q> One of the company mentioned Lord Che&s;terfield, as a man who had no friend. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"There were more materials to make friend&s;hip in Garrick, had he not been &s;o diffu&s;ed."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Garrick was pure gold, but beat out to thin leaf. Lord Che&s;terfield was tin&s;el."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Garrick was a very good man, the cheerfulle&s;t man of his age; a decent liver in a profe&s;&s;ion which is &s;uppo&s;ed to give indulgence to licentiou&s;ne&s;s; and a man who gave away, freely, money acquired by him&s;elf. He began the world with a great
<PB N="290" REF="292" MS="y">
 hunger for money; the &s;on of a half-pay officer, bred in a family who&s;e &s;tudy was to make four-pence do as much as others made four-pence halfpenny do. But, when he had got money, he was very liberal."</Q>&mdash;I pre&s;umed to animadvert on his eulogy on Garrick, in his <Q REND="inline">"Lives of the Poets."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"You &s;ay, Sir, his death eclip&s;ed the gaiety of nations."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I could not have &s;aid more nor le&s;s. It is the truth; <HI>eclip&s;ed,</HI> not <HI>extingui&s;hed;</HI> and his death <HI>did</HI> eclip&s;e; it was like a &s;torm."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But why nations? Did his gaiety extend farther than his own nation?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, &s;ome exaggeration mu&s;t be allowed. Be&s;ides, nations may be &s;aid if we allow the Scotch to be a nation, and to have gaiety, which they have not. <HI>You</HI> are an exception though. Come, gentlemen, let us candidly admit that there is one Scotchman who is cheerful."</Q> BEAUCLERK. <Q REND="inline">"But he is a very unna|tural Scotchman."</Q> I, however, continued to think the compliment to Garrick hyperbolically untrue. His acting had cea&s;ed &s;ome time before his death; at any rate he had acted in Ireland but a &s;hort time, at an early period of his life, and never in Scotland. I objected al&s;o to what appears an anticlymax of prai&s;e, when contra&s;ted with the preceding panegyrick&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"and dimini&s;hed the publick &s;tock of harmle&s;s plea&s;ure!"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Is not <HI>harmle&s;s plea&s;ure</HI> very tame?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, harmle&s;s plea&s;ure is the highe&s;t prai&s;e. Plea&s;ure is a word of dubious import; plea&s;ure is in general dan|gerous, and pernicious to virtue; to be able therefore to furni&s;h plea&s;ure that is harmle&s;s, plea&s;ure pure and unalloyed, is as great a power as man can po&s;&s;e&s;s."</Q> This was, perhaps, as ingenious a defence as could be made; &s;till, however, I was not &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>A celebrated wit being mentioned, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"One may &s;ay of him as was &s;aid of a French wit, <HI>Il n'a de l'e&s;prit que contre Dieu.</HI> I have been &s;everal times in company with him, but never perceived any &s;trong power of wit. He produces a general effect by various means; he has a chearful countenance and a gay voice; be&s;ides his trade is wit. It would be as wild in him to come into company without merriment, as for a highwayman to take the road without his pi&s;tols."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of the effects of drinking, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Drinking may be practi&s;ed with great prudence; a man who expo&s;es him&s;elf when he is intoxicated, has not the art of getting drunk; a &s;ober man who happens occa&s;ionally to get drunk, readily enough goes into a new company, which a man who has been drinking &s;hould never do. Such a man will undertake any thing; he is without &s;kill in inebriation. I u&s;ed to &s;link home when I had drunk too much. A man accu&s;tomed to &s;elf-examination will be con&s;cious when he is
<PB N="291" REF="293" MS="y">
drunk, though an habitual drunkard will not be con&s;cious of it. I knew a  phy&s;ician who for twenty years was not &s;ober; yet in a pamphlet, which he wrote upon fevers, he appealed to Garrick and me for his vindication from a charge of drunkenne&s;s. A book&s;eller (naming him) who got a large fortune by trade, was &s;o habitually and equably drunk, that his mo&s;t intimate friends never perceived that he was more &s;ober at one time than another."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of celebrated and &s;ucce&s;sful irregular practi&s;ers in phy&s;ick; he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Taylor was the mo&s;t ignorant man I ever knew; but &s;prightly. Ward the dulle&s;t. Taylor challenged me once to talk Latin with him; (laughing). I quoted &s;ome of Horace, which he took to be a part of my own &s;peech. He &s;aid a few words well enough."</Q> BEAUCLERK. <Q REND="inline">"I re|member, Sir, you &s;aid that Taylor was an in&s;tance how far impudence could carry ignorance."</Q> Mr. Beauclerk was very entertaining this day, and told us a number of &s;hort &s;tories in a lively elegant manner, and with that air of <HI>the world</HI> which has I know not what impre&s;&s;ive effect, as if there were &s;omething more than is expre&s;&s;ed, or than perhaps we could perfectly under|&s;tand. As John&s;on and I accompanied Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds in his coach, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"There is in Beauclerk a predominance over his company, that one does not like. But he is a man who has lived &s;o much in the world, that he has a &s;hort &s;tory on every occa&s;ion; he is always ready to talk and is never exhau&s;ted."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on and I pa&s;&s;ed the evening at Mi&s;s Reynolds's, Sir Jo&s;hua's &s;i&s;ter. I mentioned that an eminent friend of our's talking of the common remark, that affection de&s;cends, &s;aid that <Q REND="inline">"this was wi&s;ely contrived for the pre&s;ervation of mankind; for which it was not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be affection from children to parents, as from parents to children; nay there would be no harm in that view though children &s;hould at a certain age eat their parents."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, if this were known generally to be the ca&s;e, parents would not have affection for children."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"True, Sir; for it is in expectation of a return that parents are &s;o attentive to their children; and I know a very pretty in&s;tance of a little girl of whom her father was very fond, who once when he was in a melancholy fit, and had gone to bed, per&s;uaded him to ri&s;e in good-humour, by &s;aying, 'My dear papa, plea&s;e to get up, and let me help you on with your clothes, that I may learn to do it when you are an old man."</Q></P>
<P>Soon after this time a little incident occurred, which I will not &s;uppre&s;s, be+cau&s;e I am de&s;irous that my work &s;hould be, as much as is con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tricte&s;t truth, an antidote to the fal&s;e and injurious notions of his character,

was as agreeable as I could have wi&s;hed.

<P>WHAT may be ju&s;tly denominated a &s;upine indolence of mind has been my &s;tate of exi&s;tence &s;ince I la&s;t returned to Scotland. In a livelier &s;tate I had often &s;uffered &s;everely from long intervals of &s;ilence on your part; and I had even been chid by you for expre&s;&s;ing my unea&s;ine&s;s. I was willing to take advantage of my in&s;en&s;ibility, and while I could bear the experiment, to try whether your affection for me, would, after an unu&s;ual &s;ilence on my part, make you write fir&s;t. This afternoon I have had very high &s;atisfaction by receiving your kind letter of inquiry, for which I mo&s;t gratefully thank you. I am doubtful if it was right to make the experiment; though I have gained by it. I was beginning to grow tender, and to upbraid my&s;elf, e&s;pecially after having dreamt two nights ago that I was with you. I and my wife, and my four children, are all well. I would not delay one po&s;t to an&s;wer your letter; but as it is late, I have not time to do more. You &s;hall &s;oon hear from me, upon many and various particulars; and I &s;hall never again put you to any te&s;t.</P>

 On the 22d of July, I wrote to him again; and gave him an account of my la&s;t interview with my worthy friend, Mr. Edward Dilly, at his brother's hou&s;e at Southill, in Bedford&s;hire, where he died &s;oon after I parted from him, leaving me a very kind remembrance of his regard.</P>
<P>I informed him that Lord Hailes, who had promi&s;ed to furni&s;h him with &s;ome anecdotes for his <Q REND="inline">"Lives of the Poets,"</Q> had &s;ent me three in&s;tances of Prior's borrowing from <HI>Gombauld,</HI> in <Q REND="inline">"Recueil des Poetes,"</Q> tome 3.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ARE you playing the &s;ame trick again, and trying who can keep &s;ilence longe&s;t? Remember that all tricks are either knavi&s;h or childi&s;h; and that it is as fooli&s;h to make experiments upon the con&s;tancy of a friend, as upon the cha&s;tity of a wife.</P>
<P>What can be the cau&s;e of this &s;econd fit of &s;ilence, I cannot conjecture; but after one trick, I will not be cheated by another, nor will harra&s;s my thoughts with conjectures about the motives of a man who, probably, acts only by caprice. I therefore &s;uppo&s;e you are well, and that Mrs. Bo&s;well is well too; and that the fine &s;ummer has re&s;tored Lord Auchinleck. I am much better than you left me; I think I am better than when I was in Scotland.</P>
<P>I forgot whether I informed you that poor Thrale has been in great danger. Mrs. Thrale likewi&s;e has mi&s;carried, and been much indi&s;po&s;ed. Every body el&s;e is well; Langton is in camp. I intend to put Lord Hailes's de&s;cription of Dryden<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Which I communicated to him from his Lord&s;hip, but it has not yet been publi&s;hed. I have a copy of it.</NOTE> into another edition, and as I know his accuracy, wi&s;h he would con&s;ider the dates, which I could not always &s;ettle to my own mind.</P>
<P>Mr. Thrale goes to Brighthelm&s;ton, about Michaelmas, to be jolly and ride a hunting. I &s;hall go to town, or perhaps to Oxford. Exerci&s;e and gaiety, or rather carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, will, I hope, di&s;&s;ipate all remains of his malady;

<P>My readers will not be di&s;plea&s;ed at being told every &s;light circum&s;tance of the manner in which Dr. John&s;on contrived to amu&s;e his &s;olitary hours. He &s;ometimes employed him&s;elf in chymi&s;try, &s;ometimes in watering and pruning a vine, and &s;ometimes in &s;mall experiments, at which tho&s;e who may &s;mile, &s;hould recollect that there are moments which admit of being &s;oothed only by trifles <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot"><P>In one of his manu&s;cript Diaries, there is the following entry, which marks his curious minute attention: <Q REND="inline">"Aug. 7, 1779. <HI>Partem brachii dextri carpo proximam et cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">em pectoris <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> maxillam d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">xtram ra&s;i, ut notum fieret quanto temporis pili renovarentur.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Another of the &s;ame kind appears, <Q REND="inline">"July 26, 1768. I &s;haved my nail by accident in whetting the knife, about an eighth of an inch from the bottom, and about a fourth from the top. This I mea&s;ure that I may know the growth of nails; the whole is about five eighths of an inch."</Q></P>
<P>And, <Q REND="inline">"Aug. 15, 1783. I cut from the vine 41 leaves, which weighed five oz. and a half, and eight &s;cruples:&mdash;I lay them upon my book-ca&s;e to &s;ee what weight they will lo&s;e by drying."</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the 20th of September I defended my&s;elf again&s;t his &s;u&s;picion of me, which I did not de&s;erve; and I added, <Q REND="inline">"Pray let us write frequently. A whim &s;trikes me, that we &s;hould each &s;end off a &s;heet once a week, like a &s;tage-coach, whether it be full or not; nay, though it &s;hould be empty. The very &s;ight of your hand-writing would comfort me; and were a &s;heet to be thus &s;ent regularly, we &s;hould much oftener convey &s;omething, were it only a few kind words."</Q></P>
<P>My friend Colonel James Stuart, &s;econd &s;on of the Earl of Bute, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a good officer of the Bedford&s;hire militia, had taken a publick-&s;pirited re&s;olution to &s;erve his country in its difficulties, by rai&s;ing a regular regiment, and taking the command of it him&s;elf. This, in the heir of the immen&s;e property of Wortley, was highly honourable. Having been in Scotland recruiting, he obligingly a&s;ked me to accompany him to Leeds, then the head-quarters of his corps; from thence to London for a &s;hort time, and afterwards to other places to which the regiment might be ordered. Such an offer, at a time of the year when I had full lei&s;ure, was very plea&s;ing; e&s;pecially as I was to accompany a man of &s;terling good &s;en&s;e, information, di&s;cernment, and conviviality; and was to have a &s;econd crop, in one year, of London and John&s;on. Of this I informed my illu&s;trious friend,
<PB N="298" REF="300" MS="y">
 in characteri&s;tical warm terms, in a letter dated the 30th of September, from Leeds.</P>
<P>On Monday, October 4, I called at his hou&s;e before he was up. He &s;ent for me to his bed&s;ide, and expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at this incidental meeting, with as much vivacity as if he had been in the gaiety of youth. He called bri&s;kly, <Q REND="inline">"Frank, go and get coffee, and let us breakfa&s;t in &s;plendour."</Q></P>
<P>During this vi&s;it to London I had &s;everal interviews with him, which it is unnece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h particularly. I con&s;ulted him as to the appoint|ment of guardians to my children, in ca&s;e of my death. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) do not appoint a number of guardians. When they are many, they tru&s;t one to another, and the bu&s;ine&s;s is neglected. I would advi&s;e you to choo&s;e only one; let him be a man of re&s;pectable character, who, for his own credit, will do what is right; let him be a rich man, &s;o that he may be under no temptation to take advantage; and let him be a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, who is u&s;ed to conduct affairs with ability and expertne&s;s, to whom, therefore, the execu|tion of the tru&s;t will not be burthen&s;ome."</Q></P>
<P>On Sunday, October 10, we dined together at Mr. Strahan's. The con|ver&s;ation having turned on the prevailing practice of going to the Ea&s;t-Indies in que&s;t of wealth;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"A man had better have ten thou&s;and pounds at the end of ten years pa&s;&s;ed in England, than twenty thou&s;and pounds at the end of ten years pa&s;&s;ed in India, becau&s;e you mu&s;t compute what you <HI>give</HI> for money; and a man who has lived ten years in India, has given up ten years of &s;ocial comfort and all tho&s;e advantages which ari&s;e from living in England. The ingenious Mr. Brown, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Capability Brown,</HI> told me, that he was once at the &s;eat of Lord Clive, who had returned from India with great wealth; and that he &s;hewed him at the door of his bed-chamber a large che&s;t, which he &s;aid he had once had full of gold; upon which Brown ob&s;erved, 'I am glad you can bear it &s;o near your bed-chamber."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of the &s;tate of the poor in London.&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Saunders Welch, the Ju&s;tice, who was once High-Con&s;table of Holborn, and had the be&s;t opportunities of knowing the &s;tate of the poor, told me, that I under-rated the number, when I computed that twenty a week, that is, above a thou&s;and a year, died of hunger; not ab&s;olutely of immediate hunger, but of the wa&s;ting and other di&s;ea&s;es which are the con&s;equences of hunger. This hap|pens only in &s;o large a place as London, where people are not known. What we are told about the great &s;ums got by begging is not true: the trade is over&s;tocked. And, you may depend upon it, there are many who

cannot get work. A particular kind of manufacture fails. Tho&s;e who have  been u&s;ed to work at it can, for &s;ome time, work at nothing el&s;e.

<P>I went home with him, and we had a long quiet conver&s;ation.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the year 1763, being at London, I was carried by Dr. John Blair, Prebendary of We&s;tmin&s;ter, to dine at old Lord Bathur&s;t's; where we found the late Mr. Mallet, Sir James Porter, who had been Amba&s;&s;adour at Con&s;tantinople, the late Dr. Macaulay, and two or three more. The con|ver&s;ation turning on Mr. Pope, Lord Bathur&s;t told us, that 'The E&s;&s;ay on Man' was originally compo&s;ed by Lord Bolingbroke in pro&s;e, and that Mr. Pope did no more than put it into ver&s;e: that he had read Lord Bolingbroke's manu&s;cript in his own hand-writing; and remembered well, that he was at a lo&s;s whether mo&s;t to admire the elegance of Lord Bolingbroke's pro&s;e, or the beauty of Mr. Pope's ver&s;e. When Lord Bathur&s;t told this, Mr. Mallet bade me attend, and remember this remarkable piece of informa|tion; as, by the cour&s;e of Nature, I might &s;urvive his Lord&s;hip, and be a
<PB N="300" REF="302" MS="y">
 witne&s;s of his having &s;aid &s;o. The conver&s;ation was indeed too remarkable to be forgotten. A few days after, meeting with you, who were then al&s;o at London, you will remember that I mentioned to you what had pa&s;&s;ed on this &s;ubject, as I was much &s;truck with this anecdote. But what a&s;certains my recollection of it beyond doubt, is, that being accu&s;tomed to keep a journal of what pa&s;&s;ed when I was at London, which I wrote out every evening, I find the particulars of the above information, ju&s;t as I have now given them, di&s;tinctly marked; and am thence enabled to fix this conver&s;a|tion to have pa&s;&s;ed on Friday, the 22d of April, 1763.</P>
<P>I remember al&s;o di&s;tinctly, (though I have not for this the authority of my journal,) that the conver&s;ation going on concerning Mr. Pope, I took notice of a report which had been &s;ometimes propagated that he did not under&s;tand Greek. Lord Bathur&s;t &s;aid to me, that he knew that to be fal&s;e; for that part of the Iliad was tran&s;lated by Mr. Pope in his hou&s;e in the country; and that in the mornings, when they a&s;&s;embled at breakfa&s;t, Mr. Pope u&s;ed frequently to repeat, with great rapture, the Greek lines which he had been tran&s;lating, and then to give them his ver&s;ion of them, and to compare them together.</P>
<P>If the&s;e circum&s;tances can be of any u&s;e to Dr. John&s;on, you have my full liberty to give them to him. I beg you will, at the &s;ame time, pre&s;ent to him my mo&s;t re&s;pectful compliments, with be&s;t wi&s;hes for his &s;ucce&s;s and fame in all his literary undertakings.</P>

<P>JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Depend upon it, Sir, this is too &s;trongly &s;tated. Pope may have had from Bolingbroke the philo&s;ophick &s;tamina of his E&s;&s;ay: and admitting this to be true, Lord Bathur&s;t did not intentionally fal&s;ify. But the thing is not true in the latitude that Blair &s;eems to imagine; we are &s;ure that the poetical imagery, which makes a great part of the poem, was Pope's own. It is amazing, Sir, what deviations there are from preci&s;e truth, in the account which is given of almo&s;t every thing. I told Mrs. Thrale, 'You have &s;o little anxiety about truth, that you never tax your memory with the exact thing.' Now what is the u&s;e of the memory to truth,
<PB N="301" REF="303" MS="y">
if one is carele&s;s of exactne&s;s? Lord Hailes's 'Annals of Scotland' are  very exact; but they contain mere dry particulars. They are to be con&s;idered as a Dictionary. You know &s;uch things are there; and may be looked at when you plea&s;e. Robert&s;on paints; but the misfortune is, you are &s;ure he does not know the people whom he paints: &s;o you cannot &s;uppo&s;e a likene&s;s. Characters &s;hould never be given by an hi&s;torian unle&s;s he knew the people whom he de&s;cribes, or copies from tho&s;e who knew them."</Q></P>
<P>BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, do people play this trick which I ob&s;erve now, when I look at your grate, putting the &s;hovel again&s;t it to make the fire burn?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"They play the trick, but it does not make the fire burn. <HI>There</HI> is a better (&s;etting the poker perpendicularly up at right angles with the grate). In days of &s;uper&s;tition they thought, as it made a cro&s;s with the bars, it would drive away the witch."</Q></P>
<P>BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"By a&s;&s;ociating with you, Sir, I am always getting an acce&s;&s;ion of wi&s;dom. But perhaps a man, after knowing his own character&mdash;the limited &s;trength of his own mind, &s;hould not be de&s;irous of having too much wi&s;dom, con&s;idering, <HI>quid valeant humeri,</HI> how little he can carry."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, be as wi&s;e as you can; let a man be <HI>aliis laetus, &s;apiens &s;ibi:</HI>
<Q><L>'Though pleas'd to &s;ee the dolphins play,</L>

You may be wi&s;e in your &s;tudy in the morning, and gay in company at a tavern in the evening. Every man is to take care of his own wi&s;dom and his own virtue, without minding too much what others think."</Q></P>

<P>I mentioned to him a di&s;pute between a friend of mine and his lady, con|cerning conjugal infidelity, which my friend had maintained was by no means &s;o bad in the hu&s;band, as in the wife. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Your friend was in the right, Sir. Between a man and his Maker it is a different que&s;tion; but between a man and his wife, a hu&s;band's infidelity is nothing. They are connected by children, by fortune, by &s;erious con&s;iderations of community. Wi&s;e married women don't trouble them&s;elves about infidelity in their hu&s;|bands."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure there is a great difference between the offence of infidelity in a man and that of his wife."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"The difference is boundle&s;s. The man impo&s;es no ba&s;tards upon his wife."</Q></P>
<P>Here it may be que&s;tioned whether John&s;on was entirely in the right. I &s;up|po&s;e it will not be controverted that the difference in the degree of criminality is very great, on account of con&s;equences: but &s;till it may be maintained, that, independent of moral obligation, infidelity is by no means a light offence in a hu&s;band; becau&s;e it mu&s;t hurt a delicate attachment, in which a mutual con|&s;tancy is implied, with &s;uch refined &s;entiments as Ma&s;&s;inger has exhibited in his play of <Q REND="inline">"The Picture."</Q> John&s;on probably at another time would have admitted this opinion. And let it be kept in remembrance, that he was very careful not to give any encouragement to irregular conduct. A gentleman, not adverting to the di&s;tinction made by him upon this &s;ub|ject, &s;uppo&s;ed a ca&s;e of &s;ingular perver&s;ene&s;s in a wife, and heedle&s;sly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"That then he thought a hu&s;band might do as he plea&s;ed with a
<PB N="303" REF="305" MS="y">
&s;afe con&s;cience."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, this is wild indeed (&s;miling); you  mu&s;t con&s;ider that fornication is a crime in a &s;ingle man; and you cannot have more liberty by being married."</Q></P>
<P>He this evening expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;trongly again&s;t the Roman Catholicks; ob&s;erving, <Q REND="inline">"In every thing in which they differ from us they are wrong."</Q> He was even again&s;t the invocation of Saints; in &s;hort, he was in the humour of oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Having regretted to him that I had learnt little Greek, as is too generally the ca&s;e in Scotland, that I had for a long time hardly applied at all to the &s;tudy of that noble language, and that I was de&s;irous of being told by him what method to follow; he recommended to me as ea&s;y helps, Sylvanus's <Q REND="inline">"Fir&s;t Book of the Iliad;"</Q> Daw&s;on's <Q REND="inline">"Lexicon to the Greek New Te&s;ta|ment;"</Q> and <Q REND="inline">"He&s;iod,"</Q> with <HI>Pa&s;oris Lexicon</HI> at the end of it.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, October 12, I dined with him at Mr. Ram&s;ay's, with Lord Newhaven, and &s;ome other company, none of whom I recollect, but a beautiful Mi&s;s Graham, a relation of his Lord&s;hip's, who a&s;ked Dr. John&s;on to hob or nob with her. He was flattered by &s;uch plea&s;ing attention, and politely told her, he never drank wine; but if &s;he would drink a gla&s;s of water, he was much at her &s;ervice. She accepted. <Q REND="inline">"Oho, Sir! (&s;aid Lord Newhaven) you are caught."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, I do not &s;ee <HI>how</HI> I am <HI>caught;</HI> but if I am caught I don't want to get free again. If I am caught, I hope to be kept."</Q> Then when the two gla&s;&s;es of water were brought, &s;miling placidly to the young lady, <Q REND="inline">"Madam, let us <HI>reciprocate.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Lord Newhaven and John&s;on carried on an argument for &s;ome time, con|cerning the Middle&s;ex election. John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Parliament may be con&s;idered as bound by law, as a man is bound where there is nobody to tie the knot. As it is clear that the Hou&s;e of Commons may expel, and expel again and again, why not allow of the power to incapacitate for that parliament, rather than have a perpetual conte&s;t kept up between parliament and the people."</Q> Lord Newhaven took the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, but re&s;pectfully &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;peak with great deference to you, Dr. John&s;on; I &s;peak to be in&s;tructed."</Q> This had its full effect upon my friend. He bowed his head almo&s;t as low as the table, to a complimenting nobleman; and called out, <Q REND="inline">"My Lord, my Lord, I do not de&s;ire all this ceremony; let us tell our minds to one another quietly."</Q> After the debate was over, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I have got lights on the &s;ubject to-day, which I had not before."</Q> This was a great deal from him, e&s;pecially as he had written a pamphlet upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="306" MS="y">
 He ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"The Hou&s;e of Commons was originally not a privilege of the people, but a check for the Crown on the Hou&s;e of Lords. I remember Henry the Eighth, wanted them to do &s;omething; they he&s;itated in the morning, but did it in the afternoon. He told them, 'It is well you did, or half your heads &s;hould have been upon Temple-bar.' But the Hou&s;e of Commons is now no longer under the power of the crown, and therefore mu&s;t be bribed."</Q> He added, <Q REND="inline">"I have no delight in talking of publick affairs."</Q></P>
<P>Of his fellow-collegian, the celebrated Mr. George Whitefield, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Whitefield never drew as much attention as a mountebank does; he did not draw attention by doing better than others, but by doing what was &s;trange. Were A&s;tley to preach a &s;ermon &s;tanding upon his head on a hor&s;e's back, he would collect a multitude to hear him; but no wi&s;e man would &s;ay he had made a better &s;ermon for that. I never treated Whitefield's mini&s;try with contempt; I believe he did good. He had devoted him&s;elf to the lower cla&s;&s;es of mankind, and among them he was of u&s;e. But when familiarity and noi&s;e claim the prai&s;e due to knowledge, art, and elegance, we mu&s;t beat down &s;uch preten&s;ions."</Q></P>
<P>What I have pre&s;erved of his conver&s;ation during the remainder of my &s;tay in London at this time, is only what follows: I told him that when I objected to keeping company with a notorious infidel, a celebrated friend of our's &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"I do not think that men who live laxly in the world, as you and I do, can with propriety a&s;&s;ume &s;uch an authority. Dr. John&s;on may, who is uniformly exemplary in his conduct. But it is not very con&s;i&s;tent to &s;hun an infidel to-day, and get drunk to-morrow."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, this is &s;ad rea&s;oning. Becau&s;e a man cannot be right in all things, is he to be right in nothing? Becau&s;e a man &s;ometimes gets drunk, is he therefore to &s;teal? This doctrine would very &s;oon bring a man to the gallows.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"After all, however, it is a difficult que&s;tion how far &s;incere Chri&s;tians &s;hould a&s;&s;ociate with the avowed enemies of religion; for in the fir&s;t place, almo&s;t every man's mind may be more or le&s;&punc; 'corrupted by evil communi|cations;' &s;econdly, the world may very naturally &s;uppo&s;e that they are not really in earne&s;t in religion, who can ea&s;ily bear its opponents; and thirdly, if the pro&s;ane find them&s;elves quite well received by the pious, one of the checks upon an open declaration of their in&s;idelity, and one of the probable chances of obliging them &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect, which their being &s;hunned would do, is removed."</Q></P>

<P>IT was not till one o'clock on Monday morning, that Colonel Stuart and I left London; for we cho&s;e to bid a cordial adieu to Lord Mount&s;tuart, who was to &s;et out on that day on his emba&s;&s;y to Turin. We drove on excellently, and reached Lichfield in good time enough that night. The Colonel had heard &s;o preferable a character of the George, that he would not put up at the Three Crowns, &s;o that I did not &s;ee our ho&s;t, Wilkins. We found at the George as good accommodation as we could wi&s;h to have, and I fully enjoyed the comfortable thought that <HI>I was in Lichfield again.</HI> Next morning it rained very hard; and as I had much to do in a little time, I ordered a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and between eight and
<PB N="306" REF="308" MS="y">
 nine &s;allied forth to make a round of vi&s;its. I fir&s;t went to Mr. Green, hoping to have had him to accompany me to all my other friends, but he was engaged to attend the Bi&s;hop of Sodor and Man, who was then lying at Lichfield very ill of the gout. Having taken a ha&s;ty glance at the additions to Green's mu&s;eum, from which it was not ea&s;y to break away, I next went to the Friery, where I at fir&s;t occa&s;ioned &s;ome tumult in the ladies, who were not prepared to receive <HI>company</HI> &s;o early: but my <HI>name,</HI> which has by wonderful felicity come to be &s;o clo&s;ely a&s;&s;ociated with yours, &s;oon made all ea&s;y; and Mrs. Cobb and Mi&s;s Adye re-a&s;&s;umed their &s;eats at the breakfa&s;t-table, which they had quitted with &s;ome precipitation. They received me with the kindne&s;s of old acquaintance; and after we had joined in a cordial chorus to <HI>your</HI> prai&s;e, Mrs. Cobb gave <HI>me</HI> the high &s;atisfaction of hearing that you &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Bo&s;well is a man who I believe never left a hou&s;e without leaving a wi&s;h for his return.'</Q> And &s;he afterwards added, that &s;he bid you tell me, that if ever I came to Lichfield, &s;he hoped I would take a bed at the Friery. From thence, I drove to Peter Garrick's, where I al&s;o found a very flattering wel|come. He appeared to me to enjoy his u&s;ual cheerfulne&s;s; and he very kindly a&s;ked me to come when I could, and pa&s;s a week with him. From Mr. Garrick's I went to the Palace to wait on Mr. Seward. I was fir&s;t enter|tained by his lady and daughter, he him&s;elf being in bed with a cold, according to his valetudinary cu&s;tom. But he de&s;ired to &s;ee me; and I found him dre&s;t in his black gown, with a white flannel night-gown above it; &s;o that he looked like a Dominican friar. He was good-humoured and polite; and under his roof too my reception was very plea&s;ing. I then pro|ceeded to Stowhill, and fir&s;t paid my re&s;pects to Mrs. Ga&s;trell, who&s;e con|ver&s;ation I was not willing to quit. But my &s;and-gla&s;s was now beginning to run low, as I could not tre&s;pa&s;s too long on the Colonel's kindne&s;s, who obligingly waited for me; &s;o I ha&s;tened to Mrs. A&s;ton's, whom I found much better than I feared I &s;hould; and there I met a brother-in-law of the&s;e ladies, who talked much of you, and very well too, as it appeared to me. It then only remained to vi&s;it Mrs. Lucy Porter, which I did, I really believe, wth &s;incere &s;ati&s;|faction on both &s;ides. I am &s;ure I was glad to &s;ee her again; and, as I take her to be very hone&s;t, I tru&s;t &s;he was glad to &s;ee me again; for &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf &s;o, that I could not doubt of her being in earne&s;t. What a great key-&s;tone of kindne&s;s, my dear Sir, was you that morning! for we were all held together by our common attachment to you. I cannot &s;ay that I ever pa&s;&s;ed two hours with more &s;elf-complacency than I did tho&s;e two at Lichfield. Let me not entertain any &s;u&s;picion that this is idle vanity. Will

Of what importance can it be to hear of di&s;tant friends, to a man who finds him&s;elf welcome wherever he goes, and makes new friends fa&s;ter than he can want them? If, to the delight of &s;uch univer&s;al kindne&s;s of reception, any thing can be added by knowing that you retain my good-will, you may indulge your&s;elf in the full enjoyment of that &s;mall addition.</P>
<P>I am glad that you made the round of Lichfield with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s: the oftener you are &s;een, the more you will be liked. It was plea&s;ing to me
<PB N="308" REF="310" MS="y">
 to read that Mrs. A&s;ton was &s;o well; and that Lucy Porter was &s;o glad to &s;ee you.</P>
<P>In the place where you now are, there is much to be ob&s;erved; and you will ea&s;ily procure your&s;elf &s;kilful directors. But what will you do to keep away the <HI>black dog</HI> that worries you at home? If you would, in compliance with your father's advice, enquire into the old tenures, and old charters of Scotland, you would certainly open to your&s;elf many &s;triking &s;cenes of the manners of the middle ages. The feudal &s;y&s;tem, in a country half barbarous, is naturally productive of great anomalies in civil life. The knowledge of pa&s;t times is naturally growing le&s;s in all ca&s;es not of publick record; and the pa&s;t time of Scotland is &s;o unlike the pre&s;ent, that it is already difficult for a Scotchman to image the oeconomy of his grand-father. Do not be tardy, nor negligent; but gather up eagerly what can yet be found <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">I have a valuable-collection made by my Father, which, with &s;ome additions and illu&s;trations of my own, I intend to publi&s;h.

<P>We have, I think, once talked of another project, a Hi&s;tory of the late in&s;urrection in Scotland, with all its incidents. Many fal&s;ehoods are pa&s;&s;ing into uncontradicted hi&s;tory. Voltaire, who loved a &s;triking &s;tory, has told what we could not find to be true.</P>

<P>THAT I &s;hould importune you to write to me at Che&s;ter, is not wonderful, when you con&s;ider what an avidity I have for delight; and that the <HI>amor</HI> of plea&s;ure, like the <HI>amor nummi,</HI> increa&s;es in proportion with the
<PB N="309" REF="311" MS="y">
quantity which we po&s;&s;e&s;s of it. Your letter, &s;o full of polite kindne&s;s  and ma&s;terly coun&s;el, came like a large trea&s;ure upon me, while already glittering with riches. I was quite enchanted at Che&s;ter, &s;o that I could with difficulty quit it. But the enchantment was the rever&s;e of that of Circe; for &s;o far was there from being any thing &s;en&s;ual in it, that I was <HI>all mind.</HI> I do not mean all rea&s;on only; for my fancy was kept finely in play. And why not?&mdash;If you plea&s;e I will &s;end you a copy, or an abridgement of my Che&s;ter journal, which is truly a log-book of felicity.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop treated me with a kindne&s;s which was very flattering. I told him&punc; that you regretted you had &s;een &s;o little of Che&s;ter. His Lord&s;hip Bid me tell you, that he &s;hould be glad to &s;hew you more of it. I am proud to find the friend&s;hip with which you honour me is known in &s;o many places.</P>
<P>I arrived here late la&s;t night. Our friend the Dean, has been gone from hence &s;ome months; but I am told at my inn, that he is very <HI>populous</HI> (popular). However, I found Mr. Law, the Archdeacon, &s;on to the Bi&s;hop, and with him I have breakfa&s;ted and dined very agreeably. I got acquainted with him at the a&s;&s;izes here, about a year and a half ago; he is a man of great variety of knowledge, uncommon genius, and I believe, &s;incere religion. I received the holy &s;acrament in the cathedral in the morning, this being the fir&s;t Sunday of the month; and was at prayers there in the evening. It is divinely cheering to me to think that there is a Cathedral &s;o near Auchinleck; and I now leave Old England in &s;uch a &s;tate of mind as I am thankful to GOD for granting me.</P>
<P>The <HI>black dog</HI> that worries me at home I cannot but dread; yet as I have been for &s;ome time pa&s;t in a military train, I tru&s;t I &s;hall <HI>repul&s;e</HI> him. To hear from you will animate me like the &s;ound of a trumpet, I therefore hope that &s;oon after my return to the Northern field, I &s;hall receive a few lines from you.</P>
<P>Colonel Stuart did me the honour to e&s;cort me in his carriage to &s;hew me Liverpool, and from thence back again to Warrington, where we parted <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">His regiment was afterwards ordered to Jamaica, where he accompanied it, and almo&s;t lo&s;t his life by the climate.

<P>Poor Mr. Thrale has been in extreme danger from an apoplectical di&s;order, and recovered, beyond the expectation of his phy&s;icians; he is now at Bath, that his mind may be quiet, and Mrs. Thrale and Mi&s;s are with him.</P>
<P>Having told you what has happened to your friends, let me &s;ay &s;ome|thing to you of your&s;elf. You are always complaining of melancholy, and I conclude from tho&s;e complaints that you are fond of it. No man talks of that which he is de&s;irous to conceal, and every man de&s;ires to conceal that of which he is a&s;hamed. Do not pretend to deny it; <HI>manife&s;tum habemus furem;</HI> make it an invariable and obligatory law to your&s;elf, never to mention your own mental di&s;ea&s;es; If you are never to &s;peak of them you will think on them but little, and if you think little of them, they will mole&s;t you rarely. When you talk of them, it is plain that you want either prai&s;e or pity; for prai&s;e there is no room, and pity will do you no good; therefore, from this hour &s;peak no more, think no more about them.</P>

<P>On the 2d of May I wrote to him, and reque&s;ted that we might have another meeting &s;omewhere in the North of England, in the autumn of this year.</P>
<P>From Mr. Langton I received &s;oon after this time a letter, of which I extract a pa&s;&s;age, relative at once to Mr. Beauclerk and Dr. John&s;on.</P>
<Q><P>The melancholy information you have received concerning Mr. Beauclerk's death is true. Had his talents been directed in any &s;ufficient degree as they ought, I have always been &s;trongly of opinion that they were calculated to make an illu&s;trious figure; and that opinion, as it had been in
<PB N="316" REF="318">
 part formed upon Dr. John&s;on's judgement, receives more and more con|firmation by hearing, that &s;ince his death, Dr. John&s;on has &s;aid concerning them; a few evenings ago, he was at Mr. Ve&s;ey's, where Lord Althorpe, who was one of a numerous company there, addre&s;&s;ed Dr. John&s;on on the &s;ubject of Mr. Beauclerk's death, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'Our CLUB has had a great lo&s;s &s;ince we met la&s;t.'</Q> He replied, <Q REND="inline">'A lo&s;s, that perhaps the whole nation could not repair!'</Q> The Doctor then went on to &s;peak of his endowments, and particularly extolled the wonderful ea&s;e with which he uttered what was highly excellent. He &s;aid, that no man ever was &s;o free when he was going to &s;ay a good thing, from a <HI>look</HI> that expre&s;&s;ed that it was coming; or, when he had &s;aid it, from a look that expre&s;&s;ed that it <HI>had</HI> come. At Mr. Thrale's, &s;ome days before, when we were talking on the &s;ame &s;ubject, he &s;aid, referring to the &s;ame idea of his wonderful facility, <Q REND="inline">'That Beauclerk's talents were tho&s;e which he had felt him&s;elf more di&s;po&s;ed to envy, than tho&s;e of any whom he had known.'</Q></P>
<P>At the evening I have &s;poken of above, at Mr. Ve&s;ey's, you would have been much gratified, as it exhibited an in&s;tance of the high importance in which Dr. John&s;on's character is held, I think even beyond any I ever before was witne&s;s to. The company con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of ladies, among whom were the Duche&s;s Dowager of Portland, the Duche&s;s of Beaufort, whom I &s;uppo&s;e from her rank, I mu&s;t name before her mother Mrs. Bo&s;cawen, and her elder &s;i&s;ter Mrs. Lew&s;on, who was likewi&s;e there; Lady Lucan, Lady Clermont, and others of note both for their &s;tation and under&s;tandings. Among the gentlemen were, Lord Althorpe, whom I have before named, Lord Macartney, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Lord Lucan, Mr. Wraxal, who&s;e book you have probably &s;een, <HI>'The Tour to the Northern Parts of Europe;'</HI> a very agreeable ingenious man; Dr. Warren, Mr. Pepys, the Ma&s;ter in Chancery, whom I believe you know, and Dr. Barnard, the Provo&s;t of Eton. As &s;oon as Dr. John&s;on was come in and had taken a chair, the company began to collect round him till they became not le&s;s than four if not five deep; tho&s;e behind &s;tanding, and li&s;tening over the heads of tho&s;e that were &s;itting near him. The conver&s;ation for &s;ome time was chiefly between Dr. John&s;on and the Provo&s;t of Eton, while the others contributed occa&s;ionally their remarks. Without attempting to detail the particulars of the conver&s;ation, which perhaps if I did, I &s;hould &s;pin my account out to a tedious length, I thought, my dear Sir, this general account of the re&s;pect with which our valued friend was attended to, might be acceptable.</P></Q>

</LETTER>
<P>While John&s;on was thus engaged in preparing a delightful literary entertainment for the world, the tranquillity of the metropolis of Great-Britain was unexpectedly di&s;turbed, by the mo&s;t horrid &s;eries of outrage that ever di&s;graced a civilized country. A relaxation of &s;ome of the &s;evere penal provi&s;ions again&s;t our fellow &s;ubjects of the Catholick communion had been granted by the legi&s;lature, with an oppo&s;ition &s;o incon&s;iderable, that the genuine mildne&s;s of Chri&s;tianity, united with liberal policy, &s;eemed to have become general in this i&s;land. But a dark and malignant &s;pirit of per&s;ecution &s;oon &s;hewed it&s;elf, in an unworthy petition for the repeal of the wi&s;e and humane &s;tatute. That petition was brought forward by a mob, with the evident purpo&s;e of intimidation, and was ju&s;tly rejected. But the attempt was accompanied and followed by &s;uch daring violence as is unexampled in hi&s;tory. Of this extraordinary tumult, Dr. John&s;on has given the following conci&s;e, lively, and ju&s;t account in his <Q REND="inline">"Letters to Mrs. Thrale <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 143. <HI>et &s;eq.</HI> I have &s;elected pa&s;&s;ages from &s;everal letters, without mentioning dates.</NOTE>:"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"On Friday, the good Prote&s;tants met in St. George's-Fields, at the &s;ummons of Lord George Gordon, and marching to We&s;tmin&s;ter, in&s;ulted the Lords and Commons, who all bore it with great tamene&s;s. At night the outrages began by the demolition of the ma&s;s-hou&s;e by Lincoln's-Inn."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"An exact journal of a week's defiance of government I cannot give you. On Monday, Mr. Strahan, who had been in&s;ulted, &s;poke to Lord Mansfield, who had I think been in&s;ulted too, of the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the populace; and his Lord&s;hip treated it as a very &s;light irregularity. On Tue&s;day night they pulled down Fielding's hou&s;e, and burnt his goods in the &s;treet. They had
<PB N="318" REF="320">
 gutted on Monday Sir George Savile's hou&s;e, but the building was &s;aved. On Tue&s;day evening, leaving Fielding's ruins, they went to Newgate to demand their companions who had been &s;eized demoli&s;hing the chapel. The keeper could not relea&s;e them but by the Mayor's permi&s;&s;ion, which he went to a&s;k; at his return he found all the pri&s;oners relea&s;ed, and Newgate in a blaze. They then went to Bloom&s;bury, and fa&s;tened upon Lord Mansfield's hou&s;e, which they pulled down; and as for his goods, they totally burnt them. They have &s;ince gone to Caen-wood, but a guard was there before them. They plundered &s;ome Papi&s;ts, I think, and burnt a ma&s;s-hou&s;e in Moorfields the &s;ame night."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"On Wedne&s;day I walked with Dr. Scot to look at Newgate, and found it in ruins, with the fire yet glowing. As I went by, the Prote&s;tants were plundering the Se&s;&s;ions-hou&s;e at the Old Bailey. There were not, I believe, a hundred; but they did their work at lei&s;ure, in full &s;ecurity, without &s;enti|nels, without trepidation, as men lawfully employed, in full day. Such is the cowardice of a commercial place. On Wedne&s;day they broke open the Fleet, and the King's-bench, and the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, and Wood-&s;treet Compter, and Clerkenwell Bridewell, and relea&s;ed all the pri&s;oners."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"At night they &s;et fire to the Fleet, and to the King's-bench, and I know not how many other places; and one might &s;ee the glare of conflagra|tion fill the &s;ky from many parts. The &s;ight was dreadful. Some people were threatened: Mr. Strahan advi&s;ed me to take care of my&s;elf. Such a time of terrour you have been happy in not &s;eeing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The King &s;aid in council, 'That the magi&s;trates had not done their duty, but that he would do his own;' and a proclamation was publi&s;hed, directing us to keep our &s;ervants within doors, as the peace was now to be pre&s;erved by force. The &s;oldiers were &s;ent out to different parts, and the town is now at quiet."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The &s;oldiers are &s;tationed &s;o as to be every where within call; there is no longer any body of rioters, and the individuals are haunted to their holes, and led to pri&s;on; Lord George was la&s;t night &s;ent to the Tower. Mr. John Wilkes was this day in my neighbourhood, to &s;eize the publi&s;hes of a &s;editious paper."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Several chapels have been de&s;troyed, and &s;everal inoffen&s;ive Papi&s;ts have been plundered; but the high &s;port was to burn the gaols. This was a good rabble trick. The debtors and the criminals were all &s;et at liberty; but of the criminals, as has always happened, many are already re-taken; and two
<PB N="319" REF="321">
pirates have &s;urrendered them&s;elves, and it is expected that they will be  pardoned."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Government now acts again with its proper force; and we are all again under the protection of the King and the law. I thought that it would be agree|able to you and my ma&s;ter to have my te&s;timony to the publick &s;ecurity; and that you would &s;leep more quietly when I told you that you are &s;afe."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There has, indeed, been an univer&s;al panick, from which the King was the fir&s;t that recovered. Without the concurrence of his mini&s;ters, or the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the civil magi&s;trate, he put the &s;oldiers in motion, and &s;aved the town from calamities, &s;uch as a rabble's government mu&s;t naturally produce."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The publick has e&s;caped a very heavy calamity. The rioters attempted the Bank on Wedne&s;day night, but in no great number; and like other thieves, with no great re&s;olution. Jack Wilkes headed the party that drove them away. It is agreed, that if they had &s;eized the Bank on Tue&s;day, at the height of the panick, when no re&s;i&s;tance had been prepared, they might have carried irrecoverably away whatever they had found. Jack who was always zealous for order and decency, declares, that if he be tru&s;ted with power, he will not leave a rioter alive. There is, however, now no longer any need of heroi&s;m or blood&s;hed; no blue ribband is any longer worn."</Q></P>
<P>Such was the end of this mi&s;erable &s;edition, from which London was delivered by the magnanimity of the Sovereign him&s;elf. Whatever &s;ome may maintain, I am &s;atisfied that there was no combination or plan, either dome&s;tick or foreign; but that the mi&s;chief &s;pread by a gradual contagion of frenzy, augmented by the quantities of fermented liquors, of which the deluded populace po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in the cour&s;e of their depredations.</P>
<P>I &s;hould think my&s;elf very much to blame, did I here neglect to do ju&s;tice to my e&s;teemed friend Mr. Akerman, the keeper of Newgate, who has long di&s;charged a very important tru&s;t with an uniform intrepid firmne&s;s, and at the &s;ame time a tenderne&s;s and a liberal charity, which entitle him to be recorded with di&s;tingui&s;hed honour.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion, from the timidity and negligence of magi&s;tracy on the one hand, and the almo&s;t incredible exertions of the mob on the other, the fir&s;t pri&s;on of this great country was laid open, and the pri&s;oners &s;et free; but that Mr. Akerman, who&s;e hou&s;e was burnt, would have prevented all this, had proper aid been &s;ent to him in due time, there can be no doubt.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="322">
 Many years ago, a fire broke out in the brick part which was built as an addition to the old gaol of Newgate. The pri&s;oners were in con&s;ternation and tumult, calling out, <Q REND="inline">"We &s;hall be burnt&mdash;we &s;hall be burnt! down with the gate&mdash;down with the gate!"</Q> Mr. Akerman ha&s;tened to them, &s;hewed him&s;elf at the gate, and having, after &s;ome confu&s;ed vociferation of <Q REND="inline">"Hear him&mdash;hear him!"</Q> obtained a &s;ilent attention, he then calmly told them, that the gate mu&s;t not go down; that they were under his care, and that they &s;hould not be permitted to e&s;cape: but that he could a&s;&s;ure them, they need not be afraid of being burnt, for that the fire was not in the pri&s;on, properly &s;o called, which was &s;trongly built with &s;tone; and that if they would engage to be quiet, he him&s;elf would come in to them, and conduct them to the further end of the building, and would not go out till they gave him leave. To this propo&s;al they agreed; upon which Mr. Akerman, having fir&s;t made them fall back from the gate, went in, and with a determined re&s;olution ordered the outer turnkey upon no account to open the gate, even though the pri&s;oners (though he tru&s;ted they would not) &s;hould break their word, and by force bring him&s;elf to order it. <Q REND="inline">"Never mind me, (&s;aid he,) &s;hould that happen."</Q> The pri&s;oners peaceably followed him, while he conducted them through pa&s;&s;ages, of which he had the keys, to the extremity of the gaol, which was mo&s;t di&s;tant from the fire. Having, by this very judicious conduct, fully &s;atisfied them that there was no immediate ri&s;k, if any at all, he then addre&s;&s;ed them thus: <Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen, you are now convinced that I told you true. I have no doubt that the engines will &s;oon extingui&s;h this fire: if they &s;hould not, a &s;ufficient guard will come, and you &s;hall all be taken out and lodged in the Compters. I a&s;&s;ure you, upon my word and honour, that I have not a farthing in&s;ured. I have left my hou&s;e that I might take care of you. I will keep my promi&s;e, and &s;tay with you, if you in&s;i&s;t upon it: but if you will allow me to go out and look after my family and property, I will be obliged to you."</Q> Struck with his behaviour, they called out, <Q REND="inline">"Ma&s;ter Akerman, you have done bravely; it was very kind in you: by all means go and take care of your own concerns."</Q> He did &s;o accordingly, while they remained and were all pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>John&s;on has been heard to relate the &s;ub&s;tance of this &s;tory with high prai&s;e, in which he was joined by Mr. Burke. My illu&s;trious friend, &s;peak|ing of Mr. Akerman's kindne&s;s to his pri&s;oners, pronounced this eulogy upon his character:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He who has long had con&s;tantly in his view the wor&s;t of mankind, and is yet eminent for the humanity of his di&s;po&s;ition,

If you &s;ay, that I ought to have written, I now write, and I write to tell you, that I have much kindne&s;s for you and Mrs. Beattie; and that I wi&s;h your health better, and

 your life long. Try change of air, and come a few degrees Southwards; a &s;ofter climate may do you both good; winter is coming on; and London will be warmer, and gayer, and bu&s;ier, and more fertile of amu&s;ement than Aberdeen.</P>
<P>My health is better; but that will be little in the balance, when I tell you that Mrs. Montagu has been very ill, and is I doubt now but weakly. Mr. Thrale has been very dangerou&s;ly di&s;ordered; but is much better, and I hope will totally recover. He has withdrawn him&s;elf from bu&s;ine&s;s the whole &s;ummer. Sir Jo&s;hua and his &s;i&s;ter are well; and Mr. Davies has had great &s;ucce&s;s as an authour <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Meaning his entertaining <Q REND="inline">"Memoirs of David Garrick, E&s;q."</Q> of which John&s;on (as Davies informed me) wrote the fir&s;t &s;entence; thus giving as it were, the key-note to the performance.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FIND you have taken one of your fits of taciturnity, and have re&s;olved not to write till you are written to; it is but a peevi&s;h humour, but you &s;hall have your way.</P>
<P>I have &s;ate at home in Bolt-court, all the &s;ummer, thinking to write the Lives, and a great part of the time only thinking. Several of them, however, are done, and I &s;till think to do the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Thrale and his family have, &s;ince his illne&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed their time fir&s;t at Bath, and then at Brighthelm&s;ton; but I have been at neither place. I would have gone to Lichfield, if I could have had time, and I might have had time, if I had been active; but I have mi&s;&s;ed much, and done little.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="325" MS="y">
In the late di&s;turbances, Mr. Thrale's hou&s;e and &s;tock were in great  danger; the mob was pacified at their fir&s;t inva&s;ion, with about fifty pounds in drink and meat; and at their &s;econd, were driven away by the &s;oldiers. Mr. Strahan got a garri&s;on into his hou&s;e, and maintained them a fortnight; he was &s;o frighted that he removed part of his goods. Mrs. Williams took &s;helter in the country.</P>
<P>I know not whether I &s;hall get a ramble this autumn; it is now about the time when we were travelling. I have, however, better health than I had then, and hope you and I may yet &s;hew our&s;elves on &s;ome part of Europe, A&s;ia, or Africa <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">It will, no doubt be remarked how he avoids the <HI>rebellious</HI> land of America. This puts me in mind of an anecdote, for which I am obliged to my worthy &s;ocial friend, Governour Penn: <Q REND="inline">"At one of Mi&s;s E. Hervey's a&s;&s;emblies, Dr. John&s;on was following her up and down the room; upon which Lord Abingdon ob&s;erved to her. 'Your great friend is very fond of you, you can go no where without him.&mdash;'Aye, (&s;aid &s;he,) he would follow me to any part of the world.'&mdash;'Then (&s;aid the Earl,) a&s;k him to go with you to <HI>America.</HI>"</Q></NOTE>. In the mean time let us play no trick, but keep each other's kindne&s;s by all means in our power.</P>
<P>The bearer of this is Dr. Dunbar, of Aberdeen, who has written and publi&s;hed a very ingenious book <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"E&s;&s;ays on the Hi&s;tory of Mankind."</Q></NOTE>, and who I think has a kindne&s;s for me, and will when he knows you have a kindne&s;s for you.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e your little ladies are grown tall; and your &s;on is become a learned young man. I love them all, and I love your naughty lady, whom I never &s;hall per&s;uade to love me. When the Lives are done, I &s;hall &s;end them to complete her collection, but mu&s;t &s;end them in paper, as for want of a pattern, I cannot bind them to fit the re&s;t.</P>

<P>This year he wrote to a young clergyman in the country, the following very excellent letter, which contains valuable advice to Divines in general:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOT many days ago Dr. Lawrence &s;hewed me a letter, in which you make mention of me: I hope, therefore, you will not be di&s;plea&s;ed that I endeavour to pre&s;erve your good-will by &s;ome ob&s;ervations which your letter &s;ugge&s;ted to me.</P>
<P>You are afraid of falling into &s;ome improprieties in the daily &s;ervice, by reading to an audience that requires no exactne&s;s. Your fear, I hope,
<PB N="324" REF="326">
 &s;ecures you from danger. They who contract ab&s;urd habits are &s;uch as have no fear. It is impo&s;&s;ible to do the &s;ame thing very often, without &s;ome pecu|liarity of manner: but that manner may be good or bad, and a little care will at lea&s;t pre&s;erve it from being bad: to make it very good, there mu&s;t, I think, be &s;omething of natural or ca&s;ual felicity, which cannot be taught.</P>
<P>Your pre&s;ent method of making your &s;ermons &s;eems very judicious. Few frequent preachers can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ermons more their own than yours will be. Take care to regi&s;ter, &s;omewhere or other, the authours from whom your &s;everal di&s;cour&s;es are borrowed; and do not imagine that you &s;hall always remember, even what perhaps you now think it impo&s;&s;ible to forget.</P>
<P>My advice, however, is, that you attempt, from time to time, an original &s;ermon; and in the labour of compo&s;ition, do not burden your mind with too much at once; do not exact from your&s;elf, at one effort of excogi|tation, propriety of thought and elegance of expre&s;&s;ion. Invent fir&s;t, and then embelli&s;h. The production of &s;omething, where nothing was before, is an act of greater energy than the expan&s;ion or decoration of the thing produced. Set down diligently your thoughts as they ri&s;e, in the fir&s;t words that occur; and, when you have matter, you will ea&s;ily give it form: nor, perhaps, will this method be always nece&s;&s;ary; for, by habit, your thoughts and diction will flow together.</P>
<P>The compo&s;ition of &s;ermons is not very difficult: the divi&s;ions not only help the memory of the hearer, but direct the judgement of the writer; they &s;upply &s;ources of invention, and keep every part in its proper place.</P>
<P>What I like lea&s;t in your letter is your account of the manners of your pari&s;h; from which I gather, that it has been long neglected by the par&s;on. The Dean of Carli&s;le <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Dr. Percy, now Bi&s;hop of Dromore.</NOTE>, who was then a little rector in Northampton&s;hire, told me, that it might be di&s;cerned whether or no there was a clergyman re&s;ident in a pari&s;h, by the civil or &s;avage manner of the people. Such a congregation as yours &s;tands in much need of reformation; and I would not have you think it impo&s;&s;ible to reform them. A very &s;avage pari&s;h was civili&s;ed by a decayed gentlewoman, who came among them to teach a petty &s;chool. My learned friend Dr. Wheeler of Oxford, when he was a young man, had the care of a neighbouring pari&s;h for fifteen pounds a year, which he was never paid; but he counted it a convenience that it compelled him to make a &s;ermon weekly. One woman he could not bring to the communion; and, when he reproved or exhorted her, &s;he only an&s;wered, that &s;he was no &s;cholar. He was advi&s;ed to &s;et &s;ome good woman or man of the pari&s;h, a
<PB N="325" REF="327">
little wi&s;er than her&s;elf, to talk to her in language level to her mind. Such  hone&s;t, I may call them holy artifices, mu&s;t be practi&s;ed by every clergy|man; for all means mu&s;t be tried by which &s;ouls may be &s;aved. Talk to your people, however, as much as you can; and you will find, that the more frequently you conver&s;e with them upon religious &s;ubjects, the more willingly they will attend, and the more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively they will learn. A clergyman's diligence always makes him venerable. I think I have now only to &s;ay, that in the momentous work you have undertaken, I pray GOD to ble&s;s you.</P>

<P>My next letters to him were of dates Augu&s;t 24, September 6, and October 1, and from them I extract the following pa&s;&s;ages:</P>
<Q><P>My brother David and I find the long indulged fancy of our comfortable meeting again at Auchinleck, &s;o well reali&s;ed, that it in &s;ome degree con|firms the plea&s;ing hope of <HI>O! praeclarum diem!</HI> in a future &s;tate.</P>
<P>I beg that you may never again harbour a &s;u&s;picion of my indulging a peevi&s;h humour, or playing tricks; you will recollect, that when I confe&s;&s;ed to you, that when I had once been intentionally &s;ilent to try your regard, I gave you my word and honour that I &s;hould not do &s;o again.</P>
<P>I rejoice to hear of your good &s;tate of health; I pray GOD to continue it long. I have often &s;aid, that I would willingly have ten years added to my life, to have ten taken from yours; I mean, that I would be ten years older, to have you ten years younger. But let me be thankful for the years during which I have enjoyed your friend&s;hip, and plea&s;e my&s;elf with the hopes of enjoying it many years to come in this &s;tate of being, tru&s;ting always, that in another &s;tate, we &s;hall meet never to be &s;eparated. Of this we can form no notion; but the thought, though indi&s;tinct, is delightful, when the mind is calm and clear.</P>
<P>The riots in London were certainly horrible; but you give me no account of your own &s;ituation, during the barbarous anarchy. A de&s;cription of it by DR. JOHNSON would be a great painting <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">I had not then &s;een his Letters to Mrs. Thrale.</NOTE>; you might write another 'LONDON, A POEM.'</P>
<P>I am charmed with your conde&s;cending affectionate expre&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">'let us keep each other's kindne&s;s by all the means in our power;'</Q> my revered Friend! how elevating is it to my mind, that I am found worthy to be a
<PB N="326" REF="328" MS="y">
 companion to Dr. Samuel John&s;on! All that you have &s;aid in grateful prai&s;e of Mr. Walm&s;ley, I have long thought of you; but we are both Tories, which has a very general influence upon our &s;entiments. I hope that you will agree to meet me at York, about the end of this month; or if you will come to Carli&s;le, that would be better &s;till, in ca&s;e the Dean be there. Plea&s;e to con&s;ider, that to keep each other's kindne&s;s, we &s;hould every year have that free and intimate communication of mind which can be had only when we are together. We &s;hould have both our &s;olemn and our plea&s;ant talk.</P>
<P>I write now for the third time, to tell you that my de&s;ire for our meeting this autumn, is much increa&s;ed. I wrote to 'Squire Godfrey Bo&s;ville, my York&s;hire Chief, that I &s;hould, perhaps, pay him a vi&s;it, as I was to hold a conference with Dr. John&s;on, at York. I give you my word and honour that I &s;aid not a word of his inviting you; but he wrote to me as follows:</P>
<P><Q>'I need not tell you I &s;hall be happy to &s;ee you here the latter end of this month, as you propo&s;e; and I &s;hall likewi&s;e be in hopes that you will per&s;uade Dr. John&s;on to fini&s;h the conference here. It will add to the favour of your own company, if you prevail upon &s;uch an a&s;&s;ociate, to a&s;&s;i&s;t your ob&s;ervations. I have often been entertained with his writings, and I once belonged to a club of which he was a member, and I never &s;pent an evening there, but I heard &s;omething from him well worth remembering.'</Q></P>
<P>We have thus, my dear Sir, good comfortable quarters in the neigh|bourhood of York, where you may be a&s;&s;ured we &s;hall be heartily welcome. I pray you then re&s;olve to &s;et out; and let not the year 1780 be a blank in our &s;ocial calendar, and in that record of wi&s;dom and wit, which I keep with &s;o much diligence, to your honour, and the in&s;truction and delight of others.</P></Q>
<P>Mr. Thrale had now another conte&s;t for the repre&s;entation in parliament of the borough of Southwark, and John&s;on kindly lent him his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by writing adverti&s;ements and letters for him. I &s;hall in&s;ert one, as a &s;pecimen: *</P>

<P>I AM &s;orry to write you a letter that will not plea&s;e you, and yet it is at la&s;t what I re&s;olve to do. This year mu&s;t pa&s;s without an interview; the &s;ummer has been fooli&s;hly lo&s;t, like many other of my &s;ummers and winters. I hardly &s;aw a green field, but &s;taid in town to work, without working much.</P>
<P>Mr. Thrale's lo&s;s of health has lo&s;t him the election; he is now going to Brighthelm&s;ton, and expects me to go with him, and how long I &s;hall &s;tay I cannot tell. I do not much like the place, but yet I &s;hall go, and &s;tay while my &s;tay is de&s;ired. We mu&s;t, therefore, content our&s;elves with knowing what we know as well as man can know the mind of man, that we love one another, and that we wi&s;h each other's happine&s;s, and that the lap&s;e of a year cannot le&s;&s;en our mutual kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>I was plea&s;ed to be told that I accu&s;ed Mrs. Bo&s;well unju&s;tly, in &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;he bears me ill-will. I love you &s;o much, that I would be glad to love all that love you, and that you love; and I have love very ready for Mrs. Bo&s;well, if &s;he thinks it worthy of acceptance. I hope all the young ladies and gentlemen are well.</P>
<P>I take a great liking to your brother. He tells me that his father received him kindly, but not fondly; however, you &s;eem to have lived well enough at Auchinleck, while you &s;taid. Make your father as happy as you can.</P>
<P>You lately told me of your health: I can tell you in return, that my health has been for more than a year pa&s;t, better than it has been for many years before. Perhaps it may plea&s;e GOD to give us &s;ome time together before we are parted.</P>

Being di&s;appointed in my hopes of meeting John&s;on this year, &s;o that I  could hear none of his admirable &s;ayings, I &s;hall compen&s;ate for this want by in&s;erting a collection of them, for which I am indebted to my worthy friend Mr. Langton, who&s;e kind communications have been &s;eparately interwoven in many parts of this work. A very few articles of this collection were committed to writing by him&s;elf, he not having that habit; which he regrets, and which tho&s;e who know the numerous opportunities he had of gathering the rich fruits of <HI>John&s;onian</HI> wit and wi&s;dom, mu&s;t ever regret. I however found, in conver&s;ations with him, that a good &s;tore of <HI>John&s;oniana</HI> was trea&s;ured in his mind; and I compared it to Herculaneum, or &s;ome old Roman field, which, when dug, fully rewards the labour employed. The authenticity of every article is unque&s;tionable. For the expre&s;&s;ion, I, who wrote them down in his pre&s;ence, am partly an&s;werable.</P>
<Q><P>Theocritus is not de&s;erving of very high re&s;pect as a writer; as to the pa&s;toral part, Virgil is very evidently &s;uperiour. He wrote when there had been a larger influx of knowledge into the world than when Theocritus lived. Theocritus does not abound in de&s;cription, though living in a beautiful country: the manners painted are coar&s;e and gro&s;s. Virgil has much more de&s;cription, more &s;entiment, more of Nature, and more of art. Some of the mo&s;t excellent parts of Theocritus are, where Ca&s;tor and Pollux, going with the other Argonauts, land on the Bebrycian coa&s;t, and there fall into a di&s;pute with Amycus, the King of that country; which is as well conducted as Euripides could have done it; and the battle is well related. Afterwards they carry off a woman, who&s;e two brothers come to recover her, and expo&s;tulate with Ca&s;tor and Pollux on their inju&s;tice; but they pay no regard to the brothers, and a battle en&s;ues, where Ca&s;tor and his brother are triumphant. Theocritus &s;eems not to have &s;een that the brothers have the advantage in their argument over his Argonaut heroes.&mdash;'The Sicilian Go&s;&s;ips' is a piece of merit.</P>
<P>Callimachus is a writer of little excellence. The chief thing to be learned from him is his account of Rites and Mythology; which, though de&s;irable to be known for the &s;ake of under&s;tanding other parts of ancient authours, is the lea&s;t plea&s;ing or valuable part of their writings.</P>
<P>Mattaire's account of the Stephani is a heavy book. He &s;eems to have been a puzzle-headed man, with a large &s;hare of &s;cholar&s;hip, but with little geometry or logick in his head, without method, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of little genius. He wrote Latin ver&s;es from time to time, and publi&s;hed a &s;et in his old age,
<PB N="330" REF="332" MS="y">
 which he called <HI>'Senilia;'</HI> in which he &s;hews &s;o little learning or ta&s;te in writing, as to make <HI>Carteret</HI> a dactyl.&mdash;In matters of genealogy it is nece&s;&s;ary to give the bare names as they are; but in poetry, and in pro&s;e of any elegance in the writing, they require to have inflection given to them.&mdash;His book of the Dialects is a &s;ad heap of confu&s;ion; the only way to write on them is to tabulate them with Notes, added at the bottom of the page, and references.</P>
<P>It may be que&s;tioned, whether there is not &s;ome mi&s;take as to the methods of employing the poor, &s;eemingly on a &s;uppo&s;ition that there is a certain portion of work left undone for want of per&s;ons to do it; but if that is otherwi&s;e, and all the materials we have are actually worked up, or all the manufactures we can u&s;e or di&s;po&s;e of are already executed, then what is given to the poor, who are to be &s;et at work, mu&s;t be taken from &s;ome who now have it, as time mu&s;t be taken for learning, according to Sir William Petty's ob&s;ervation; a certain part of tho&s;e very materials that, as it is, are properly worked up, mu&s;t be &s;poiled by the un&s;kilfulne&s;s of novices. We may apply to well-meaning, but misjudging per&s;ons in particular of this nature, what Giannone &s;aid to a monk, who wanted what he called to convert him: <HI>'Tu &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;anto ma Tu non &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Filo&s;ofo.'</HI>&mdash;It is an unhappy circum&s;tance that one might give away five hundred pounds in a year to tho&s;e that importune in the &s;treets, and not do any good.</P>
<P>There is nothing more likely to betray a man into ab&s;urdity than <HI>conde&s;cen&s;ion;</HI> when he &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e his under&s;tanding too powerful for his company.</P>
<P>Having a&s;ked Mr. Langton if his father and mother had &s;ate for their pictures, which he thought it right for each generation of a family to do, and being told they had oppo&s;ed it, he &s;aid, 'Sir, among the infractuo&s;ities of the human mind, I know not if it may not be one, that there is a &s;uper|&s;titious reluctance to &s;it for a picture.</P>
<P>John Gilbert Cooper related, that &s;oon after the publication of his Dictionary, Garrick being a&s;ked by John&s;on what people &s;aid of it, told him, that among other animadver&s;ions, it was objected that he cited authori|ties which were beneath the dignity of &s;uch a work, and mentioned Richard&s;on. 'Nay, (&s;aid John&s;on,) I have done wor&s;e than that: I have cited thee, David.</P>
<P>Talking of expence, he ob&s;erved, with what munificence a great mer|chant will &s;pend his money, both from his having it at command, and from his enlarged views by calculation of a good effect upon the whole. 'Whereas

(&s;aid he) you will hardly ever find a country gentleman who is not a good  deal di&s;concerted at an unexpected occa&s;ion for his being obliged to lay out ten pounds.</P>
<P>When in good humour he would talk of his own writings with a won|derful frankne&s;s and candour, and would even critici&s;e them with the clo&s;e&s;t &s;everity. One day, having read over one of his Ramblers, Mr. Langton a&s;ked him, how he liked that paper; he &s;hook his head, and an&s;wered, 'too wordy.' And at another time, when one was reading his tragedy of 'Irene,' to a company at a hou&s;e in the country, he left the room; and &s;omebody having a&s;ked him the rea&s;on of this, he replied, 'Sir, I thought it had been better.</P>
<P>Talking of a point of delicate &s;crupulo&s;ity of moral conduct, he &s;aid to Mr. Langton, 'Men of harder minds than ours will do many things from which you and I would &s;hrink; yet, Sir, they will, perhaps, do more good in life than we. But let us try to help one another. If there be a wrong twi&s;t, it may be &s;et right. It is not probable that two people can be wrong the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>Of the Preface to Capel's Shak&s;peare, he &s;aid, 'If the man would have come to me, I would have endeavoured to 'endow his purpo&s;es with words;' for, as it is, 'he doth gabble mon&s;trou&s;ly.</P>
<P>He related, that he had once in a dream a conte&s;t of wit with &s;ome other per&s;on, and that he was very much mortified by imagining that his opponent had the better of him. 'Now (&s;aid he) one may mark here the effect of &s;leep in weakening the power of reflection; for had not my judge|ment failed me, I &s;hould have &s;een, that the wit of this &s;uppo&s;ed antagoni&s;t, by who&s;e &s;uperiority I felt my&s;elf depre&s;&s;ed, was as much furni&s;hed by me, as that which I thought I had been uttering in my own character.</P>
<P>One evening in company, an ingenious and learned gentleman read a letter of compliment to him from one of the Profe&s;&s;ors of a foreign Univer&s;ity. John&s;on, in an irritable fit, thinking there was too much o&s;tentation, &s;aid, 'I never receive any of the&s;e tributes of applau&s;e from abroad. One in&s;tance I recollect of a foreign publication, in which mention is made of <HI>l'illu&s;tre Lockman.</HI></P>
<P>Of Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds he &s;aid, 'Sir, I know no man who has pa&s;&s;ed through life with more ob&s;ervation than Reynolds.</P>
<P>He repeated to Mr. Langton, with great energy, in the Greek, our SAVIOUR'S gracious expre&s;&s;ion concerning the forgivene&s;s of Mary Magdalen,
<PB N="332" REF="334" MS="y">
 <GAP DESC="foreign">. Thy faith hath &s;aved thee; go in peace <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Luke vii. 50.</NOTE>.' He &s;aid, 'the manner of this di&s;mi&s;&s;ion is exceedingly affecting.</P>
<P>He thus defined the difference between phy&s;ical and moral truth; 'Phy&s;ical truth, is, when you tell a thing as it actually is. Moral truth, is, when you tell a thing &s;incerely and preci&s;ely as it appears to you. I &s;ay &s;uch a one walked acro&s;s the &s;treet; if he really did &s;o I told a phy&s;ical truth. If I thought &s;o, though I &s;hould have been mi&s;taken, I told a moral truth.</P>
<P>Huggins, the tran&s;lator of Ario&s;to, and Mr. Thomas Warton, in the early part of his literary life, had a di&s;pute concerning that poet, of whom Mr. Warton, in his 'Ob&s;ervations on Spencer's Fairy Queen,' gave &s;ome account, which Huggins attempted to an&s;wer with violence, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'I will <HI>militate</HI> no longer again&s;t his <HI>ne&s;cience.'</HI></Q> Huggins was ma&s;ter of the &s;ubject, but wanted expre&s;&s;ion. Mr. Warton's knowledge of it was then imperfect, but his manner lively and elegant. John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'It appears to me, that Huggins has ball without powder, and Warton powder without ball.</Q></P>
<P>Talking of the Farce of 'High Life below Stairs,' he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Here is a Farce, which is really very diverting when you &s;ee it acted; and yet one may read it, and not know that one has been reading any thing at all.</Q></P>
<P>He u&s;ed at one time to go occa&s;ionally to the green-room of Drury-lane Theatre, where he was much regarded by the players, and was very ea&s;y and facetious with them. He had a very high opinion of Mrs. Clive's comick powers, and conver&s;ed more with her than with any of them. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Clive, Sir, is a good thing to &s;it by, &s;he always under&s;tands what you &s;ay.'</Q> And &s;he &s;aid of him, <Q REND="inline">'I love to &s;it by Dr. John&s;on, he always entertains me.'</Q> One night, when 'The Recruiting Officer' was acted, he &s;aid to Mr. Holland, who had been expre&s;&s;ing an apprehen&s;ion that Dr. John&s;on would di&s;dain the works of Farquhar; <Q REND="inline">'No, Sir, I think Farquhar a man who&s;e writings have con&s;iderable merit.</Q></P>
<P>His friend Garrick was &s;o bu&s;y in conducting the drama, that they could not have &s;o much intercour&s;e as Mr. Garrick u&s;ed to profe&s;s an anxious wi&s;h that there &s;hould be. There might indeed be &s;omething in the con|temptuous &s;everity as to the merit of acting, which his old preceptor nouri&s;hed in him&s;elf, that would mortify Garrick after the great applau&s;e which he received from the audience. For though John&s;on &s;aid of him, <Q REND="inline">'Sir, a man who has a nation to admire him every night, may well be expected to be &s;omewhat elated;'</Q> yet he would treat theatrical matters with a
<PB N="333" REF="335" MS="y">
Iudicrous &s;light. He mentioned one evening, <Q REND="inline">'I met David coming off  the &s;tage, dre&s;t in a woman's riding-hood, when he acted in The Wonder; I came full upon him, and I believe he was not plea&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>Once he a&s;ked Tom Davies, whom he &s;aw dre&s;t in a fine &s;uit of clothes, <Q REND="inline">'And what art thou to-night?'</Q> Tom an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'The Thane of Ro&s;s;'</Q> (which it will be recollected is a very incon&s;iderable character). <Q REND="inline">'O brave!'</Q> &s;aid John&s;on.</P>
<P>Of Mr. Longley, at Roche&s;ter, a gentleman of very con&s;iderable learning, whom Dr. John&s;on met there, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'My heart warms towards him. I was &s;urprized to find in him &s;uch a nice acquaintance with the metre in the learned languages; though I was &s;omewhat mortified that I had it not &s;o much to my&s;elf, as I &s;hould have thought.</Q></P>
<P>Talking of the minutene&s;s with which people will record the &s;ayings of eminent per&s;ons, a &s;tory was told, that when Pope was on a vi&s;it to Spence at Oxford, as they looked from the window they &s;aw a Gentleman Commoner, who was ju&s;t come in from riding, amu&s;ing him&s;elf with whipping at a po&s;t. Pope took occa&s;ion to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">'That young gentleman &s;eems to have little to do.'</Q> Mr. Beauclerk ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">'Then, to be &s;ure, Spence turned round and wrote that down;'</Q> and went on to &s;ay to Dr. John&s;on, <Q REND="inline">'Pope, Sir, would have &s;aid the &s;ame of you, if he had &s;een you di&s;tilling.'</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">'Sir, if Pope had told me of my di&s;tilling, I would have told him of his grotto.</Q></P>
<P>He would allow no &s;ettled indulgence of idlene&s;s upon principle, and always repelled every attempt to urge excu&s;es for it. A friend one day &s;ug|ge&s;ted, that it was not whole&s;ome to &s;tudy &s;oon after dinner. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">'Ah, Sir, don't give way to &s;uch a fancy. At one time of my life I had taken it into my head that it was not whole&s;ome to &s;tudy between breakfa&s;t and dinner.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Beauclerk one day repeated to Dr. John&s;on, Pope's lines,
<Q><L>'Let mode&s;t Fo&s;ter, if he will, excel</L>
<L>'Ten metropolitans in preaching well:'</L></Q>
Then a&s;ked the Doctor, <Q REND="inline">'Why did Pope &s;ay this?'</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">'Sir, he hoped it would vex &s;omebody.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Gold&s;mith, upon occa&s;ion of Mrs. Lennox's bringing out a play, &s;aid to Dr. John&s;on at the CLUB, that a per&s;on had advi&s;ed him to go and hi&s;s it, becau&s;e &s;he had attacked Shak&s;peare in her book called 'Shak&s;peare

<P>His affection for Topham Beauclerk was &s;o great, that when Beauclerk was labouring under that &s;evere illne&s;s which at la&s;t occa&s;ioned his death, John&s;on &s;aid, (with a voice faultering with emotion,) <Q REND="inline">'Sir, I would walk to the extent of the diameter of the earth to &s;ave Beauclerk.</Q></P>
<P>One night at the CLUB he produced a tran&s;lation of an Epitaph which Lord Elibank had written in Engli&s;h, for his Lady, and reque&s;ted of John&s;on to turn into Latin for him. Having read <HI>Domina de North et Gray,</HI> he &s;aid to Dyer, <Q REND="inline">'You &s;ee, Sir, what barbari&s;ms we are compelled to make u&s;e of, when modern titles are to be &s;pecifically mentioned in Latin in&s;criptions.'</Q> When he had read it once aloud, and there had been a general approbation expre&s;&s;ed by the company, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Mr. Dyer in particular, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Sir, I beg to have your judgement, for I know your nicety.'</Q> Dyer then very properly de&s;ired to read it over again; which, having done, he pointed out an incongruity in one of the &s;entences. John&s;on immediately a&s;&s;ented to the ob&s;ervation, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Sir, this is owing to an alteration of a part of the &s;entence, from the form in which I had fir&s;t written it; and I believe, Sir, you may have remarked, that it is a very frequent cau&s;e of errour in compo&s;ition, when one has made a partial change, without a due regard to the general &s;tructure of the &s;entence.</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on was well acquainted with Mr. Do&s;&s;ie, authour of a treati&s;e on Agriculture; and &s;aid of him, <Q REND="inline">'Sir, of the objects which the Society of Arts have chiefly in view, the chymical effects of bodies operating upon other bodies, he knows more than almo&s;t any man.'</Q> John&s;on, in order to give Mr. Do&s;&s;ie his vote to be a member of this Society, paid up an arrear which had run on for two years. On this occa&s;ion he mentioned a circum&s;tance, as characteri&s;tick of the Scotch. <Q REND="inline">'One of that nation, (&s;aid he,) who had been a candidate, again&s;t whom I had voted, came up to me with a civil &s;aluta|tion. Now, Sir, this is their way.

Talking on the &s;ubject of toleration, one day when &s;ome friends were  with him in his &s;tudy, he made his u&s;ual remark, that the State has a right to regulate the religion of the people, who are the children of the State. A clergyman having readily acquie&s;ced in this, John&s;on, who loved di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">'But, Sir, you mu&s;t go round to other States than our own. You do not know what a Bramin has to &s;ay for him&s;elf. In &s;hort, Sir, I have got no farther than this. Every man has a right to utter what he thinks truth, and every other man has a right to knock him down for it. Martyr|dom is the te&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>A man, he ob&s;erved, &s;hould begin to write &s;oon; for, if he waits till his judgement is matured, his inability, through want of practice to expre&s;s his conceptions, will make the di&s;proportion &s;o great between what he &s;ees, and what he can attain, that he will probably be di&s;couraged from writing at all. As a proof of the ju&s;tne&s;s of this remark, we may in&s;tance what is related of the great Lord Granville; that after he had written his letter, giving an account of the battle of Dettingen, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Here is a letter, expre&s;&s;ed in terms not good enough for a tollow-chandler to have u&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>Talking of a Court-martial that was &s;itting upon a very momentous publick occa&s;ion, he expre&s;&s;ed much doubt of an enlightened deci&s;ion; and &s;aid, that perhaps there was not a member of it, who in the whole cour&s;e of his life, had ever &s;pent an hour by him&s;elf in balancing probabilities.</P>
<P>Gold&s;mith one day brought to the CLUB a printed Ode, which he, with others, had been hearing read by its authour in a publick room, at the rate of five &s;hillings each for admi&s;&s;ion. One of the company having read it aloud, Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Bolder words, and more timorous meaning, I think never were brought together.</Q></P>
<P>Talking of Gray's Odes, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'They are forced plants, rai&s;ed in a hot-bed; and they are poor plants; they are but cucumbers after all.'</Q> A gentleman pre&s;ent, who had been running down Ode-writing in general, as a bad &s;pecies of poetry, unluckily &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Had they been literally cucumbers, they had been better things than Odes.'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Yes, Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) for a <HI>hog.</HI></Q></P>
<P>His di&s;tinction of the different degrees of attainment of learning was thus marked upon two occa&s;ions.

<P>He u&s;ed to quote, with great warmth, the &s;aying of Ari&s;totle recorded by Diogenes Laertius; that there was the &s;ame difference between one learned and unlearned, as between the living and the dead.</P>

 It is very remarkable, that he retained in his memory very &s;light and trivial, as well as important things. As an in&s;tance of this, it &s;eems that an inferiour dome&s;tick of the Duke of Leeds had attempted to celebrate his Grace's marriage in &s;uch homely rhymes as he could make; and this curious compo&s;ition having been &s;ung to Dr. John&s;on he got it by heart, and u&s;ed to repeat it in a very plea&s;ant manner. Two of the &s;tanzas were the&s;e:
<Q><LG>
<L>'When the Duke of Leeds &s;hall married be</L>
<L>'To a fine young lady of high quality,</L>
<L>'How happy will that gentlewoman be</L>
<L>'In his Grace of Leeds's good company.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'She &s;hall have all that's fine and fair,</L>

<L>'And ride in a coach to take the air,</L>
<L>'And have a hou&s;e in St. James's-&s;quare.'</L>
</LG></Q>
To hear a man, of the weight and dignity of John&s;on, repeating &s;uch humble attempts at poetry, had a very amu&s;ing effect. He, however, &s;eriou&s;ly ob&s;erved of the la&s;t &s;tanza, that it nearly comprized all the advan|tages that wealth can give.</P>
<P>An eminent foreigner, when he was &s;hewn the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, was very trouble&s;ome with many ab&s;urd inquiries. <Q REND="inline">'Now there, Sir, (&s;aid he,) is the difference between an Engli&s;hman and a Frenchman.

<P>His unju&s;t contempt for foreigners was, indeed, extreme. One evening, at Old Slaughter's coffee-hou&s;e, when a number of them were talking loud about little matters, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Does not this confirm old Meynell's ob&s;erva|tion&mdash;For any thing I &s;ee, foreigners are fools.</Q></P>

<P>Having &s;pent an evening at Mr. Langton's, with the Reverend Dr. Parr, he was much plea&s;ed with the conver&s;ation of that learned gentleman; and, after he was gone, &s;aid to Mr. Langton, <Q REND="inline">'Sir, I am obliged to you for having a&s;ked me this evening.

<P>We may fairly in&s;titute a critici&s;m between Shak&s;peare and Corneille, as they both had, though in a different degree, the lights of a latter age. It is not &s;o ju&s;t between the Greek dramatick writers and Shak&s;peare. It may be replied to what is &s;aid by one of the remarkers on Shak&s;peare, that though Darius's &s;hade had <HI>Pre&s;cience,</HI> it does not nece&s;&s;arily follow that he had all <HI>pa&s;t</HI> particulars revealed to him.</P>
<P>Spani&s;h plays, being wildly and improbably farcical, would plea&s;e children here, as children are entertained with &s;tories full of prodigies; their experience not being &s;ufficient to cau&s;e them to be &s;o readily &s;tartled at deviations from the natural cour&s;e of life. The machinery of the Pagans is unintere&s;ting to us: when a Godde&s;s appears in Homer or Virgil, we grow weary; &s;till more &s;o in the Grecian tragedies, as in that kind of compo&s;ition a nearer approach to Nature is intended. Yet there are good rea&s;ons for reading romances; as the fertility of invention, the beauty of &s;tyle, and expre&s;&s;ion, the curio&s;ity of &s;eeing with what kind of performances the age and country in which they were written was delighted: for it is to be appre|hended, that at the time when very wild improbable tales were well received, the people were in a barbarous &s;tate, and &s;o on the footing of children, as has been explained.</P>
<P>It is evident enough that no one who writes now can u&s;e the Pagan deities and mythology; the only machinery, therefore, &s;eems that of mini&s;tring &s;pirits, the gho&s;ts of the departed, witches, and fairies, though the&s;e latter, as the vulgar &s;uper&s;tition concerning them (which, while in its force, infected at lea&s;t the imagination of tho&s;e that had more advantage in education, and only their rea&s;on &s;et them free from it,) is every day wearing out, &s;eem likely to be of little further a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the machinery of poetry. As I recollect Hammond introduces a hag or witch into one of his love elegies, where the effect is unmeaning and di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>The man who u&s;es his talent of ridicule in creating or gro&s;sly exag|gerating the in&s;tances he gives, who imputes ab&s;urdities that did not happen, or when a man was a little ridiculous, de&s;cribes him as having been very much &s;o, abu&s;es his talents greatly. The great u&s;e of delineating ab&s;urdities is, that we may know how far human folly can go; the account, there|fore, ought of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to be faithful. A certain character (naming the per&s;on) as to the general ca&s;t of it, is well de&s;cribed by Garrick, but a great deal of the phra&s;eology he u&s;es in it, is quite his own, particularly in
<PB N="338" REF="340">
 the proverbial compari&s;ons, 'ob&s;tinate as a pig,' &amp;c. but I don't know whether it might not be true of him, that from a too great eagerne&s;s for prai&s;e and popularity, and a politene&s;s carried to a ridiculous exce&s;s, he was likely, after a&s;&s;erting a thing in general, to give it up again in parts. For in&s;tance, if he had &s;aid Reynolds was the fir&s;t of painters, he was capable enough of giving up, as objections might happen to be &s;everally made; fir&s;t, his outline&mdash;then the grace in form&mdash;then the colouring&mdash;and la&s;tly, to have owned that he was &s;uch a manneri&s;t, that the di&s;po&s;ition of his pictures was all alike.</P>
<P>For ho&s;pitality, as formerly practi&s;ed, there is no longer the &s;ame rea&s;on; heretofore the poorer people were more numerous, and from want of commerce, their means of getting a livelihood more difficult; therefore the &s;upporting them was an act of great benevolence; now that the poor can find maintenance for them&s;elves and their labour is wanted, a general undi&s;cerning ho&s;pitality tends to ill, by withdrawing them from their work to idlene&s;s and drunkenne&s;s. Then formerly rents were received in kind, &s;o that there was a great abundance of provi&s;ions in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the owners of the lands, which &s;ince the plenty of money afforded by commerce is no longer the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Ho&s;pitality to &s;trangers and foreigners in our country is now almo&s;t at an end, &s;ince from the increa&s;e of them that come to us, there have been a &s;ufficient number of people that have found an intere&s;t in providing inns and proper accommodations, which is in general a more expedient method for the entertainment of travellers. Where the travellers and &s;trangers are few, more of that ho&s;pitality &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, as it has not been worth while to provide places of accommodation. In Ireland there is &s;till ho&s;pitality to &s;trangers, in &s;ome degree; in Hungary and Poland probably more.</P>

<P>A gentleman, by no means deficient in literature, having di&s;covered le&s;s acquaintance with one of the Cla&s;&s;icks than John&s;on expected, when the gentleman left the room he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">'You &s;ee, now, how little any body reads.'</Q> Mr. Langton happening to mention his having read a good deal in Clinardus's Greek Grammar, <Q REND="inline">'Why, Sir, (&s;aid he,) who is there in this town who knows any thing of Clinardus but you and I?'</Q> And upon Mr. Langton's mentioning that he had taken the pains to learn by heart the Epi&s;tle of St. Ba&s;il, which is given in that Grammar as a praxis, <Q REND="inline">'Sir, (&s;aid he,) I never made &s;uch an effort to attain Greek.</Q></P>

<P>Mr. Langton, when a very young man, read Dod&s;ley's 'Cleone: a Tragedy,' to him, not aware of his extreme impatience to be read to.

<P>Snatches of reading (&s;aid he) will not make a Bentley or a Clarke. They are, however, in a certain degree advantageous. I would put a child into a library (where no unfit books are) and let him read at his choice. A child &s;hould not be di&s;couraged from reading any thing that he takes a liking to, from a notion that it is above his reach. If that be the ca&s;e, the child will &s;oon find it out and de&s;i&s;t; if not, he of cour&s;e gains the in&s;truction; which is &s;o much the more likely to come, from the inclination with which he takes up the &s;tudy.</P>
<P>Though he u&s;ed to cen&s;ure carele&s;&s;ne&s;s with great vehemence, he owned, that he once, to avoid the trouble of locking up five guineas, hid them, he forgot where, &s;o that he could not find them.</P>

<P>In the latter part of his life, in order to &s;atisfy him&s;elf whether his mental faculties were impaired, he re&s;olved that he would try to learn a new language, and fixed upon the Low Dutch, for that purpo&s;e, and this he con|tinued till he had read about one half of 'Thomas &agrave; Kempis;' and finding that there appeared no abatement of his power of acqui&s;ition, he then de&s;i&s;ted, as thinking the experiment had been duely tried. Mr. Burke ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that this was not the mo&s;t vigorous trial, Low Dutch being a language &s;o near to our own; had it been one of the languages entirely different, he might have been very &s;oon &s;atisfied.</P>

<P>It is well known that there was formerly a rude cu&s;tom for tho&s;e who were &s;ailing upon the Thames, to acco&s;t each other as they pa&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t abu&s;ive language they could invent, generally, however with as much &s;atirical humour as they were capable of producing. Addi&s;on gives a &s;pecimen of this ribaldry, in Number 383 of 'The Spectator,' when Sir Roger de Coverley and he are going to Spring-garden.

<P><MILESTONE N="1781"> In 1781 John&s;on at la&s;t completed his <Q REND="inline">"Lives of the Poets,"</Q> of which he gives this account: <Q REND="inline">"Sometime in March I fini&s;hed the 'Lives of the Poets,' which I wrote in my u&s;ual way, dilatorily and ha&s;tily, unwilling to work, and working with vigour and ha&s;te <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 190.</NOTE>."</Q> In a memorandum previous to this, he &s;ays of them: <Q REND="inline">"Written I hope, in &s;uch a manner as may tend to the pro|motion of piety <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 174.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>This is the work which of all Dr. John&s;on's writings will perhaps be read mo&s;t generally, and with mo&s;t plea&s;ure. Philology and biography were his favourite pur&s;uits, and tho&s;e who lived mo&s;t in intimacy with him, heard him upon all occa&s;ions, when there was a proper opportunity, take delight in expatiating upon the various merits of the Engli&s;h Poets; upon the niceties of their characters, and the events of their progre&s;s through the world which they contributed to illuminate. His mind was &s;o full of that kind of information, and it was &s;o well arranged in his memory, that in performing what he had undertaken in this way, he had little more to do than to put his thoughts upon paper, exhibiting fir&s;t each Poet's life, and then &s;ubjoining a critical examina|tion of his genius and works. But when he began to write, the &s;ubject &s;welled in &s;uch a manner, that in&s;tead of prefaces to each poet of no more than a few pages as he had originally intended <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><P>His de&s;ign is thus announced in his <HI>Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">rti&s;ement:</HI> <Q REND="inline">"The Book&s;ellers having determined to publi&s;h a body of Engli&s;h Poetry, I was per&s;uaded to promi&s;e them a Preface to the works of each authour; an undertaking, as it was then pre&s;ented to my mind, not very tedious or difficult.</Q></P>

<P>This was, however, but a &s;mall recompence for &s;uch a collection of biography, and &s;uch principles and illu&s;trations of critici&s;m as, if dige&s;ted and arranged in one &s;y&s;tem by &s;ome modern Ari&s;totle or Longinus, might form a code upon that &s;ubject &s;uch as no other nation can &s;hew.

<P>In the Life of WALLER, John&s;on gives a di&s;tinct and animated narrative of publick affairs in that variegated period, with &s;trong yet nice touches of character, and having a fair opportunity to di&s;play his political principles, does it with an unqualified manly confidence, and &s;atisfies his readers how nobly he might have executed a <HI>Tory hi&s;tory</HI> of his country.</P>
<P>So ea&s;y is his &s;tyle in the&s;e Lives, that I do not recollect more than three uncommon or learned words; one, when giving an account of the approach of Waller's mortal di&s;ea&s;e, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"he found his legs grow <HI>tumid;</HI>"</Q> by u&s;ing the expre&s;&s;ion his legs <HI>&s;welled,</HI> he would have avoided this; and there would have been no impropriety in its being followed by the intere&s;ting que&s;tion to his phy&s;ician, <Q REND="inline">"What that <HI>&s;welling</HI> meant?"</Q> Another, when he mentions that Pope had <HI>emitted</HI> propo&s;als; when <HI>publi&s;hed</HI> or <HI>i&s;&s;ued,</HI> would have been more readily under&s;tood; and a third, when he calls Orrery and Dr. Delany, writers both undoubtedly <HI>veracious;</HI> when <HI>true, hone&s;t,</HI> or <HI>faithful,</HI> might have been u&s;ed. Yet, it mu&s;t be owned, that none of the&s;e are <HI>hard</HI> or <HI>too big</HI> words; that cu&s;tom would make them &s;eem as ea&s;y as any others; and that a language is richer and capable of more beauty of expre&s;&s;ion, by having a greater variety of &s;ynonimes.</P>
<P>His di&s;&s;ertation upon the unfitne&s;s of poetry for the aweful &s;ubjects of our holy religion, though I do not entirely agree with him, has all the merit of originality, with uncommon force of rea&s;oning.</P>

<P>Again&s;t his Life of MILTON, the hounds of Whiggi&s;m have opened in full cry. But of Milton's great excellence as a poet, where &s;hall we find &s;uch a blazon as by the hand of John&s;on? I &s;hall &s;elect only the following pa&s;&s;age concerning <Q REND="inline">"Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t:"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fancy can hardly forbear to conjecture with what temper Milton &s;ur|veyed the &s;ilent progre&s;s of his work, and marked his reputation &s;tealing its way in a kind of &s;ubterraneous current, through fear and &s;ilence. I cannot but conceive him calm and confident, little di&s;appointed, not at all dejected, relying on his own merit with &s;teady con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, and waiting without impa|tience, the vici&s;&s;itudes of opinion, and the impartiality of a future generation."</Q></P>
<P>Indeed even Dr. Towers, who may be con&s;idered as one of the warme&s;t zealots of <HI>The Revolution Society</HI> it&s;elf, allows, that <Q REND="inline">"John&s;on has &s;poken in the highe&s;t terms of the abilities of that great poet, and has be&s;towed on his principal poetical compo&s;itions, the mo&s;t honourable encomiums <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot"><P>See <Q REND="inline">"An E&s;&s;ay on the Life, Character, and Writings of Dr. Samuel John&s;on,"</Q> London, 1787; which is very well written, making a proper allowance for the democratical bigotry of its authour; who I cannot however but admire for his liberality in &s;peaking thus of my illu&s;trious friend:</P>
<Q><P>He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed extraordinary powers of under&s;tanding, which were much cultivated by &s;tudy, and &s;till more by meditation and reflection. His memory was remarkably retentive, his imagina|tion uncommonly vigorous, and his judgement keen and penetrating. He had a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the importance of religion; his piety was &s;incere, and &s;ometimes ardent; and his zeal for the intere&s;ts of virtue was often manife&s;ted in his conver&s;ation and in his writings. The &s;ame energy which was di&s;played in his literary productions was exhibited al&s;o in his conver&s;ation, which was various, &s;triking, and in&s;tructive; and perhaps no man ever equalled him for nervous and pointed repartees.</P>
<P>His Dictionary, his moral E&s;&s;ays, and his productions in polite literature, will convey u&s;eful in&s;truction, and elegant entertainment, as long as the language in which they are written &s;hall be under&s;tood.</P></Q></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="351" MS="y">
That a man, who venerated the Church and Monarchy as John&s;on did,  &s;hould &s;peak with a ju&s;t abhorrence of Milton as a politician, or rather as a daring foe to good polity, was &s;urely to be expected; and to tho&s;e who cen&s;ure him, I would recommend his commentary on Milton's celebrated complaint of his &s;ituation, when by the lenity of Charles the Second, <Q REND="inline">"A lenity of which (as John&s;on well ob&s;erves) the world has had perhaps no other example; he, who had written in ju&s;tification of the murder of his Sovereign, was &s;afe under an <HI>Act of Oblivion.</HI>"</Q> No &s;ooner is he &s;afe than he finds him&s;elf in danger, <HI>fallen on evil days and evil tongues, and with darkne&s;s and with danger compa&s;s'd round.</HI> This darkne&s;s, had his eyes been better employed, had undoubtedly de&s;erved compa&s;&s;ion; but to add the mention of danger was ungrateful and unju&s;t. He was fallen, indeed, on <HI>evil days;</HI> the time was come in which regicides could no longer boa&s;t their wickedne&s;s. But of <HI>evil tongues</HI> to complain, required impudence at lea&s;t equal to his other powers: Milton, who&s;e warme&s;t advocates mu&s;t allow, <Q REND="inline">"that he never &s;pared any a&s;perity of reproach, or brutality of in&s;olence."</Q></P>
<P>I have, indeed, often wondered how Milton, <Q REND="inline">"an acrimonious and &s;urly Re|publican,"</Q> a man <Q REND="inline">"who in his dome&s;tick relations was &s;o &s;evere and arbitrary,"</Q> and who&s;e head was filled with the harde&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;mal tenets of Calvini&s;m, &s;hould have been &s;uch a poet; &s;hould not only have written with &s;ublimity, but with beauty, and even gayety; &s;hould have exqui&s;itely painted the &s;weete&s;t &s;en&s;ations of which our nature is capable; imaged the delicate raptures of connubial love; nay, &s;eemed to be animated with all the &s;pirit of revelry. It is a proof that in the human mind the departments of judgement and imagination, perception and temper, may &s;ometimes be divided by &s;trong partitions; and that the light and &s;hade in the &s;ame character may be kept &s;o di&s;tinct as never to be blended.</P>
<P>In the Life of Milton, John&s;on took occa&s;ion to maintain his own and the general opinion of the excellence of rhyme over blank ver&s;e, in Engli&s;h poetry, and quotes this appo&s;ite illu&s;tration of it by <Q REND="inline">"an ingenious critick,"</Q> that <HI>it &s;eems to be ver&s;e only to the eye</HI> <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">One of the mo&s;t natural in&s;tances of the effect of blank ver&s;e happened to the late Earl of Hopeton. His Lord&s;hip ob&s;erved one of his &s;hepherds poring in the fields upon Milton's <Q REND="inline">"Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t;"</Q> and having a&s;ked him what book it was, the man an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"An't plea&s;e your Lord&s;hip, this is a very odd &s;ort of an authour: he would fain rhyme, but cannot get at it."</Q></NOTE>. The gentleman whom he thus cha|racteri&s;es is (as he told Mr. Seward) Mr. Lock, of Norbury Park, in Surrey, who&s;e knowledge and ta&s;te in the fine arts is univer&s;ally celebrated; with

<P>I could, with plea&s;ure, expatiate upon the ma&s;terly execution of the Life of DRYDEN, which we have &s;een<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">See page 85 of this Volume.</NOTE> was one of John&s;on's literary projects at an early period, and which it is remarkable, that after de&s;i&s;ting from it, from a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;cantine&s;s of materials, he &s;hould, at an advanced age, have performed &s;o amply.</P>
<P>His defence of that great poet again&s;t the illiberal attacks upon him, as if his embracing the Roman Catholick communion had been a time-&s;erving mea&s;ure, is a piece of rea&s;oning at once able and candid. Indeed, Dryden him&s;elf, in his <Q REND="inline">"Hind and Panther,"</Q> hath given &s;uch a picture of his mind, that they who know the anxiety for repo&s;e as to the aweful &s;ubject of our &s;tate beyond the grave, though they may think his opinion ill-founded, mu&s;t think charitably of his &s;entiment.</P>

<P>In drawing Dryden's character, John&s;on has given, though I &s;uppo&s;e unintentionally, &s;ome touches of his own. Thus, <Q REND="inline">"The power that pre|dominated in his intellectual operations was rather &s;trong rea&s;on than quick &s;en&s;ibility. Upon all occa&s;ions that were pre&s;ented, he &s;tudied rather than felt; and produced &s;entiments not &s;uch as Nature enforces, but meditation &s;upplies. With the &s;imple and elemental pa&s;&s;ions as they &s;pring &s;eparate in the mind, he &s;eems not much acquainted.

 The Life of POPE was written by John&s;on <HI>con amore,</HI> both from the early po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which that writer had taken of his mind&punc; and from the plea&s;ure which he mu&s;t have felt, in for ever &s;ilencing all attempts to le&s;&s;en his poetical fame, by demon&s;trating his excellence, and pronouncing, a triumphant apotheo&s;is.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"After all this, it is &s;urely &s;uperfluous to an&s;wer the que&s;tion that has once been a&s;ked, Whether Pope was a poet? otherwi&s;e than by a&s;king in return, If Pope be not a poet, where is poetry to be found? To cir|cum&s;cribe poetry by a definition, will only &s;hew the narrowne&s;s of the definer; though a definition which &s;hall exclude Pope will not ea&s;ily be made. Let us look round upon the pre&s;ent time, and back upon the pa&s;t; let enquire to whom the voice of mankind has decreed the wreath of poetry; let their productions be examined, and their claims &s;tated, and the preten&s;ions of Pope will be no more di&s;puted."</Q></P>
<P>I remember once to have heard John&s;on &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, a thou&s;and years may elap&s;e before there &s;hall appear another man with a power of ver&s;ification equal to that of Pope. That power mu&s;t undoubtedly be allowed its due &s;hare in enhancing the value of his captivating compo&s;ition."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on, who had done liberal ju&s;tice to Warburton in his edition of Shak&s;peare, which was publi&s;hed during the life of that powerful writer, with &s;till greater liberality took an opportunity of paying the tribute due to him when he was no longer in <Q REND="inline">"high place,"</Q> but numbered with the dead <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot"><P>Of John&s;on's conduct towards Warburton, a very honourable notice is taken by the editor of <Q REND="inline">"Tracts by Warburton, and a Warburtonian, not admitted into the Collection of their re&s;pective Works."</Q> After an able and <Q REND="inline">"fond, though not undi&s;tingui&s;hing,"</Q> con&s;ideration of Warburton's character, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"In two immortal works, John&s;on has &s;tood forth in the fore|mo&s;t rank of his admirers. By the te&s;timony of &s;uch a man, impertinence mu&s;t be aba&s;hed, and malignity it&s;elf mu&s;t be &s;oftened. Of literary merit, John&s;on, as we all know, was a &s;agacious but a mo&s;t &s;evere judge. Such was his di&s;cernment, that he pierced into the mo&s;t &s;ecret Springs of human actions; and &s;uch was his integrity, that he always weighed the moral characters of his fellow-creatures in the 'balance of the &s;anctuary.' He was too courageous to propitiate a rival, and too proud to truckle to a &s;uperiour. Warburton he knew, as I know him, and as every man of &s;en&s;e and virtue would wi&s;h to be known&mdash;I mean, both from his own writings, and from the writings of tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ented from his principles, or who envied his reputation. But, as to favours, he had never received or a&s;ked any from the Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter; and, if my memory fails me not, he had &s;een him only once, when they met almo&s;t without de&s;ign, conver&s;ed without much effort, and parted without any la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions of hatred or affection. Yet, with all the ardour of &s;ympathetick genius, John&s;on has done that &s;pontaneou&s;ly and ably, which, by &s;ome writers, had been before attempted injudiciou&s;ly, and which, by others, from whom more &s;ucce&s;sful attempts might have been expected, has not <HI>hitherto</HI> been done at all. He &s;poke well of Warburton, without in&s;ulting tho&s;e whom Warburton de&s;pi&s;ed. He &s;uppre&s;&s;ed not the imperfections of this extraordinary man, while he endeavoured to do ju&s;tice to his numerous and tran&s;cendental excellencies. He defended him when living, amid&s;t the clamours of his enemies; and prai&s;ed him when dead, amid&s;t the <HI>&s;ilence of his friends.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Having availed my&s;elf of this editor's eulogy on my departed friend, for which I warmly thank him, let me not &s;uffer the lu&s;tre of his reputation, hone&s;tly acquired by profound learning and vigorous eloquence, to be tarni&s;hed by a charge of illiberality. He has been accu&s;ed of invidiou&s;ly dragging again into light certain writings of a per&s;on re&s;pectable by his talents, his learning, his &s;tation, and his age, which were publi&s;hed a great many years ago, and have &s;ince, it is &s;aid, been &s;ilently given up by their authour. But when it is con&s;idered that the&s;e writings were not <HI>&s;ins of youth,</HI> but deliberate works of one well advanced in life, overflowing at once with flattery to a great man of great intere&s;t in the Church, and with unju&s;t and acrimonious abu&s;e of two men of eminent merit; and that, though it would have been unrea&s;onable to expect an humiliating recantation, no apology whatever has been made in the cool of the evening, for the oppre&s;&s;ive fervour of the heat of the day; no &s;light relenting indication has appeared in any note, or any corner of later publications; is it not fair to under&s;tand him as &s;uperciliou&s;ly per&s;evering? When he allows the &s;hafts to remain in the wounds, and will not &s;tretch forth a lenient hand, is it wrong, is it not generous to become an indignant avenger?</P></NOTE>.</P>

It &s;eems &s;trange, that two &s;uch men as John&s;on and Warburton, who lived  in the &s;ame age and country, &s;hould not only not have been in any degree of intimacy, but been almo&s;t per&s;onally unacquainted. But &s;uch in&s;tances, though we mu&s;t wonder at them, are not rare. If I am rightly informed, after a careful inquiry, they never met but once, which was at the hou&s;e of Mrs. French, in London, well known for her elegant a&s;&s;emblies, and bringing eminent characters together. The interview proved to be mutually agreeable.</P>
<P>I am well informed, that Warburton &s;aid of John&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I admire him, but I cannot bear his &s;tyle:"</Q> and that John&s;on being told of this, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"That is exactly my ca&s;e as to him."</Q> The manner in which he expre&s;&s;ed his admi|ration of the fertility of Warburton's genius and of the variety of his materials, was, <Q REND="inline">"The table is always full, Sir. He brings things from the north, and the &s;outh, and from every quarter. In his 'Divine Legation,' you are always entertained. He carries you round and round, without carrying you forward to the point; but then you have no wi&s;h to be carried forward."</Q> He &s;aid to the Reverend Mr. Strahan, <Q REND="inline">"Warburton is perhaps the la&s;t man who has written with a mind full of reading and reflection."</Q></P>
<P>It is remarkable, that in the Life of Broome, John&s;on takes notice of Dr. Warburton's u&s;ing a mode of expre&s;&s;ion which he him&s;elf u&s;ed, and that not &s;eldom, to the great offence of tho&s;e who did not know him. Having occa&s;ion to mention a note, &s;tating the different parts which were executed by the a&s;&s;ociated tran&s;lators of <Q REND="inline">"The Ody&s;&s;ey,"</Q> he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Dr. Warburton told me, in his warm language, that he thought the relation given in the note <HI>a lie.</HI>"</Q> The language is <HI>warm</HI> indeed; and, I mu&s;t own, cannot be
<PB N="354" REF="356" MS="y">
 ju&s;tified in con&s;i&s;tency with a decent regard to the e&s;tabli&s;hed forms of &s;peech. John&s;on had accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to u&s;e the word <HI>lie,</HI> to expre&s;s a mi&s;take or an errour in relation; in &s;hort, when the thing <HI>was not &s;o as told,</HI> though the relator did not <HI>mean</HI> to deceive. When he thought there was intentional fal&s;ehood in the relator, his expre&s;&s;ion was, <Q REND="inline">"He <HI>lies,</HI> and he <HI>knows</HI> he <HI>lies.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Speaking of Pope's not having been known to excel in conver&s;ation, John&s;on ob&s;erves, that <Q REND="inline">"traditional memory retains no &s;allies of raillery, or &s;entences of ob&s;ervation; nothing either pointed or &s;olid, wi&s;e or merry; and that one apophthegm only is recorded."</Q> In this re&s;pect, Pope differed widely from John&s;on, who&s;e conver&s;ation was, perhaps, more admirable than even his writings, however excellent. Mr. Wilkes has, however, favoured me with one repartee of Pope, of which John&s;on was not informed. John&s;on, after ju&s;tly cen&s;uring him for having <Q REND="inline">"nur&s;ed in his mind a fooli&s;h di&s;-e&s;teem of Kings,"</Q> tells us, <Q REND="inline">"yet a little regard &s;hewn him by the Prince of Wales melted his obduracy; and he had not much to &s;ay when he was a&s;ked by his Royal Highne&s;s, <HI>how he could love a Prince, while he di&s;liked Kings?</HI>"</Q> The an&s;wer which Pope made, was, <Q REND="inline">"The young lion is harmle&s;s, and even playful; but when his claws are full grown he becomes cruel&punc; dreadful, and mi&s;chievous."</Q></P>
<P>But although we have no collection of Pope's &s;ayings, it is not therefore to be concluded, that he was not agreeable in &s;ocial intercour&s;e; for John&s;on him&s;elf has been heard to &s;ay, that <Q REND="inline">"the happie&s;t conver&s;ation is that of which nothing is di&s;tinctly remembered but a general effect of plea&s;ing impre&s;&s;ion."</Q> The late Lord Somerville <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Let me here expre&s;s my grateful remembrance of Lord Somerville's kindne&s;s to me, at a very early period. He was the fir&s;t per&s;on of high rank that took particular notice of me in the way mo&s;t flattering to a young man, fondly ambitious of being di&s;tingui&s;hed for his literary talents; and by the honour of his encouragement made me think well of my&s;elf, and a&s;pire to de&s;erve it better. He had a happy art of communicating his varied knowledge of the world, in &s;hort remarks and anecdotes, with a quiet plea&s;ant gravity, that was exceedingly engaging. Never &s;hall I forget the hours which I enjoyed with him at his apartments in the Royal Palace of Holy-Rood Hou&s;e, and at his &s;eat near Edinburgh, which he him&s;elf had formed with an elegant ta&s;te.</NOTE>, who &s;aw much both of great and brilliant life, told me, that he had dined in company with Pope, and that after dinner the <HI>little man,</HI> as he called him, drank his bottle of Burgundy, and was exceedingly gay and entertaining.</P>
<P>I cannot with-hold from my great friend a cen&s;ure of at lea&s;t culpable inattention, to a nobleman, who, it has been &s;hewn, behaved to him with uncommon politene&s;s. He &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Except Lord Bathur&s;t, none of Pope's
<PB N="355" REF="357" MS="y">
noble friends were &s;uch as that a good man would wi&s;h to have his inti|macy  with them known to po&s;terity."</Q> This will not apply to Lord Mansfield, who was not ennobled in Pope's life-time; but John&s;on &s;hould have recol|lected, that Lord Marchmont was one of tho&s;e noble friends. He includes his Lord&s;hip along with Lord Bolingbroke, in a charge of neglect of the papers which Pope left by his will; when, in truth, as I my&s;elf pointed out to him, before he wrote that poet's life, the papers were <Q REND="inline">"committed to <HI>the &s;ole care and judgement</HI> of Lord Bolingbroke, unle&s;s he (Lord Bolingbroke) &s;hall not &s;urvive me;"</Q> &s;o that Lord Marchmont had no concern whatever with them. After the fir&s;t edition of the Lives, Mr. Malone, who&s;e love of ju&s;tice is equal to his accuracy, made, in my hearing, the &s;ame remark to John&s;on; yet he omitted to correct the erroneous &s;tatement. The&s;e particulars I mention, in the belief that there was only forgetfulne&s;s in my friend; but I owe this much to the Earl of Marchmont's reputation, who, were there no other memorials, will be immortali&s;ed by that line of Pope, in the ver&s;es on his Grotto:

<P>In the Life of ADDISON we find an unplea&s;ing account of his having lent Steele a hundred pounds, and <Q REND="inline">"reclaimed his loan by an execution."</Q> In the new edition of the <HI>Biographia Britannica,</HI> the authenticity of this anecdote is denied. But Mr. Malone has obliged me with the following note concerning it:</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="note">
<P>Many per&s;ons having doubts concerning this fact, I applied to Dr. John&s;on to learn on what authority he a&s;&s;erted it. He told me, he had it from Savage, who lived in intimacy with Steele, and who informed him, that Steele told him the &s;tory with tears in his eyes.&mdash;Ben Victor, Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, likewi&s;e informed him of this remarkable tran&s;action, from the relation of Mr. Wilkes the comedian, who was al&s;o an intimate of Steele's.&mdash;Some, in defence of Addi&s;on, have &s;aid, that <Q REND="inline">'the act was done with the good-natured view of rou&s;ing Steele, and correcting that profu&s;ion which always made him nece&s;&s;itous.'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'If that were the ca&s;e, (&s;aid John&s;on,) and that he only wanted to alarm Steele, he would afterwards have <HI>returned</HI> the money to his friend, which it is not pretended he did.'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'This, too, (he added,) might be retorted by an advocate for Steele, who might alledge, that he did not repay the loan <HI>intentionally,</HI> merely to &s;ee whether Addi&s;on would be mean and ungenerous enough to make u&s;e of legal proce&s;s to recover it. But of &s;uch &s;peculations there is no end: we cannot dive into the hearts of men; but their actions are open to ob&s;ervation.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="359" MS="y">
I then mentioned to him that &s;ome people thought that Mr. Addi&s;on's  character was &s;o pure, that the fact, <HI>though true,</HI> ought to have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.

<P>As the introduction to his critical examination of the genius and writings of YOUNG, he did Mr. Herbert Croft, then a Barri&s;ter of Lincoln's-inn, now a clergyman, the honour to adopt a Life of Young written by that gentleman, who was the friend of Dr. Young's &s;on, and wi&s;hed to vindicate him from &s;ome very mi&s;taken remarks to his prejudice. Mr. Croft's performance was &s;ubjected to the revi&s;ion of Dr. John&s;on, as appears from the following note to Mr. John Nichols:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This Life of Dr. Young was written by a friend of his &s;on. What is cro&s;&s;ed with black is expunged by the authour, what is cro&s;&s;ed with red is expunged by me. If you find any thing more that can be well omitted, I &s;hall not be &s;orry to &s;ee it yet &s;horter."</Q></P>
<P>It has always appeared to me to have a con&s;iderable &s;hare of merit, and to di&s;play a pretty &s;ucce&s;sful imitation of John&s;on's &s;tyle. When I mentioned this to a very eminent literary character, he oppo&s;ed me vehemently, ex|claiming, <Q REND="inline">"No, no, it is <HI>not</HI> a good imitation of John&s;on; it has all his pomp without his force; it has all the nodo&s;ities of the oak without its &s;trength."</Q> This was an image &s;o happy, that one might have thought he would have
<PB N="362" REF="364" MS="y">
 been &s;atisfied with it; but he was not. And &s;etting his mind again to work, he added, with exqui&s;ite felicity, <Q REND="inline">"It has all the contortions of the Sybil, without the in&s;piration."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Croft very properly guards us again&s;t &s;uppo&s;ing that Young was a gloomy man; and mentions, that <Q REND="inline">"his pari&s;h was indebted to the good|humour of the authour of the <HI>'Night Thoughts'</HI> for an A&s;&s;embly and a Bowling-Green."</Q> A letter from a noble foreigner is quoted, in which he is &s;aid to have been <Q REND="inline">"very plea&s;ant in conver&s;ation."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Langton, who frequently vi&s;ited him, informs me, that there was an air of benevolence in his manner, but that he could obtain from him le&s;s information than he had hoped to receive from one who had lived &s;o much in intercour&s;e with the brighte&s;t men of what has been called the Augu&s;tan age of England; and that he &s;hewed a degree of eager curio&s;ity concerning the common occurrences that were then pa&s;&s;ing, which appeared &s;ome|what remarkable in a man of &s;uch intellectual &s;tores, of &s;uch an advanced age, and who had retired from life with declared di&s;appointment in his expectations.</P>
<P>An in&s;tance at once of his pen&s;ive turn of mind, and his cheerfulne&s;s of temper, appeared in a little &s;tory which he him&s;elf told to Mr. Langton, when they were walking in his garden: <Q REND="inline">"Here (&s;aid he) I had put a hand&s;ome &s;un-dial, with this in&s;cription, <HI>Eheu fugaces!</HI> which (&s;peaking with a &s;mile) was &s;adly verified, for by the next morning my dial had been carried off."</Q></P>
<P>It gives me much plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve, that however John&s;on may have ca&s;ually talked, yet when he &s;its, as <Q REND="inline">"an ardent judge zealous to his tru&s;t, giving &s;entence,"</Q> upon the excellent works of Young, he allows them the high prai&s;e to which they are ju&s;tly entitled. <Q REND="inline">"The <HI>Univer&s;al Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> (&s;ays he) is indeed a very great performance,&mdash;his di&s;tichs have the weight of &s;olid &s;entiment, and his points the &s;harpne&s;s of re&s;i&s;tle&s;s truth."</Q></P>
<P>But I was mo&s;t anxious concerning John&s;on's deci&s;ion upon <Q REND="inline">"Night Thoughts,"</Q> which I e&s;teem as a ma&s;s of the grande&s;t and riche&s;t poetry that human genius has ever produced; and was delighted to find this character of that work: <Q REND="inline">"In his <HI>'Night Thoughts'</HI> he has exhibited a very wide di&s;play of original poetry, variegated with deep reflections and &s;triking allu&s;ions; a wilderne&s;s of thought, in which the fertility of fancy &s;catters flowers of every hue and of every odour. This is one of the few poems in which blank ver&s;e could not be changed for rhime but with di&s;advantage."</Q> And afterwards, <Q REND="inline">"Particular lines are not to be regarded, the power is in the whole, and in
<PB N="363" REF="365" MS="y">
the whole there is a magnificence like that a&s;cribed to Chine&s;e plantation,  the magnificence of va&s;t extent and endle&s;s diver&s;ity."</Q></P>
<P>But there is in this Poem not only all that John&s;on &s;o well brings in view, but a power of the <HI>Pathetick</HI> beyond almo&s;t any example that I have &s;een. He who does not feel his nerves &s;haken, and his heart pierced by many pa&s;&s;ages in this extraordinary work, particularly by that mo&s;t affecting one, which de&s;cribes the gradual torment &s;uffered by the contemplation of an object of affectionate attachment, vi&s;ibly and certainly decaying into di&s;&s;olution, mu&s;t be of a hard and ob&s;tinate frame.</P>
<P>To all the other excellencies of <Q REND="inline">"Night Thoughts,"</Q> let me add the great and peculiar one, that they contain not only the noble&s;t &s;entiments of virtue, and the immortality of the &s;oul, but the <HI>Chri&s;tian Sacrifice,</HI> the <HI>Divine Propi|tiation,</HI> with all its intere&s;ting circum&s;tances, and con&s;olations to <Q REND="inline">"a wounded &s;pirit,"</Q> &s;olemnly and poetically di&s;played in &s;uch imagery and language, as cannot fail to exalt, animate, and &s;oothe the truly pious.

<P>In the Life of SWIFT, it appears to me that John&s;on had a certain degree of prejudice again&s;t that extraordinary man, of which I have el&s;ewhere had occa&s;ion to &s;peak. Mr. Thomas Sheridan imputed it to a &s;uppo&s;ed appre|hen&s;ion in John&s;on, that Swift had not been &s;ufficiently active in obtaining for him an Iri&s;h degree when it was &s;olicited <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See page 67 of Vol. I.</NOTE>, but of this there was not &s;ufficient evidence; and let me not pre&s;ume to charge John&s;on with inju&s;tice, becau&s;e he did not think &s;o highly of the writings of this authour, as I have done from my youth upwards. Yet that he had an unfavourable bias is evident, were it only from that pa&s;&s;age in which he &s;peaks of Swift's practice of &s;aving, as, <Q REND="inline">"fir&s;t ridiculous and at la&s;t dete&s;table;"</Q> and yet after &s;ome examination of circum&s;tances, finds him&s;elf obliged to own, that <Q REND="inline">"it will perhaps appear that he only liked one mode of expence better than another, and &s;aved merely that he might have &s;omething to give."</Q></P>
<P>One ob&s;ervation which John&s;on makes in Swift's life &s;hould be often inculcated: <Q REND="inline">"It may be ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed, that there was in his conver&s;ation what appears &s;o frequently in his letters, an affectation of familiarity with the great, an ambition of momentary equality, &s;ought and enjoyed by the neglect of tho&s;e ceremonies which cu&s;tom has e&s;tabli&s;hed as the barriers between one order of &s;ociety and another. This tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of regularity was by him&s;elf and his admirers termed greatne&s;s of &s;oul; but a great mind di&s;dains to hold
<PB N="364" REF="366" MS="y">
 any thing by courte&s;y, and therefore never u&s;urps what a lawful claimant may take away. He that encroaches on another's dignity puts him&s;elf in his power; he is either repelled with helple&s;s indignity, or endured by clemency and conde&s;cen&s;ion."</Q></P>

<P>I have not confined my&s;elf to the order of the <Q REND="inline">"Lives,"</Q> in making my few remarks. Indeed a different order is ob&s;erved in the original publication, and in the collection of John&s;on's Works. And &s;hould it be objected, that many of my various readings are incon&s;iderable, tho&s;e who make the objection will be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider, that &s;uch &s;mall particulars are intended for tho&s;e who are nicely critical in compo&s;ition, to whom they will be an acceptable &s;election.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="367" MS="y">
<Q REND="inline">"Spence's Anecdotes,"</Q> which are frequently quoted and referred to in  John&s;on's <Q REND="inline">"Lives of the Poets,"</Q> are in a manu&s;cript collection, made by the Reverend Dr. Jo&s;eph Spence, containing a number of particulars concerning eminent men. To each anecdote is marked the name of the per&s;on on who&s;e authority it is mentioned. This valuable collection is the property of the Duke of Newca&s;tle, who upon the application of Sir Lucas Pepys, was plea&s;ed to permit it to be put into the hands of Dr. John&s;on, who I am &s;orry to think made but an aukward return. <Q REND="inline">"Great a&s;&s;i&s;tance (&s;ays he) has been given me by Mr. Spence's Collection, of which I con&s;ider the communi|cation as a favour worthy of publick acknowledgement;"</Q> but he has not owned to whom he was obliged; &s;o that the acknowledgement is unap|propriated to his Grace.</P>
<P>While the world in general was filled with admiration of John&s;on's <Q REND="inline">"Lives of the Poets,"</Q> there were narrow circles in which prejudice and re&s;entment were fo&s;tered, and from whence attacks of different &s;orts i&s;&s;ued again&s;t him. By &s;ome violent Whigs he was arraigned of inju&s;tice to Milton; by &s;ome Cambridge men of depreciating Gray, and his expre&s;&s;ing with a dignified freedom what he really thought of George, Lord Lyttelton, gave offence to &s;ome of the friends of that nobleman, and particularly produced a declaration of war again&s;t him from Mrs. Montague, the ingenious E&s;&s;ayi&s;t on Shak&s;peare, between whom and his Lord&s;hip a commerce of reciprocal compliments had long been carried on. In this war the &s;maller powers in alliance with him were of cour&s;e led to engage, at lea&s;t on the defen&s;ive, and thus I for one, was excluded from the enjoyment of <Q REND="inline">"A Fea&s;t of Rea&s;on,"</Q> &s;uch as Mr. Cumberland has de&s;cribed, with a keen, yet ju&s;t and delicate pen, in his <Q REND="inline">"OBSERVER."</Q> The&s;e minute inconveniencies gave not the lea&s;t di&s;turbance to John&s;on. He nobly &s;aid, when I talked to him of the feeble, though &s;hrill outcry which had been rai&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I con&s;idered my&s;elf as entru&s;ted with a certain portion of truth. I have given my opinion &s;incerely; let them &s;hew where they think me wrong."</Q></P>
<P>While my friend is thus contemplated in the &s;plendour derived from his la&s;t and perhaps mo&s;t admirable work, I introduce him with peculiar propriety as the corre&s;pondent of WARREN HASTINGS, a man who&s;e regard reflects dignity even upon JOHNSON; a man, the extent of who&s;e abilities was equal to that of his power; and who, by tho&s;e who are fortunate enough to know him in private life, is admired for his literature and ta&s;te, and beloved for the candour, moderation, and mildne&s;s of his character.

<P>I HAVE been fortunately &s;pared the trouble&s;ome &s;u&s;pen&s;e of a long &s;earch, to which, in performance of my promi&s;e, I had devoted this morn|ing, by lighting upon the objects of it among the fir&s;t papers that I laid my hands on: my veneration for your great and good friend, Dr. John&s;on, and the pride, or I hope &s;omething of a better &s;entiment, which I indulged in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch memorials of his good-will towards me, having induced me to bind them in a parcel containing other &s;elect papers, and labelled with the titles appertaining to them. They con&s;i&s;t but of three letters, which I believe were all that I ever received from Dr. John&s;on. Of the&s;e, one, which was written in quadruplicate, under the different dates of its re&s;pective di&s;patches, has already been made publick, but not from any communica|tion of mine. This, however, I have joined to the re&s;t; and have now the plea&s;ure of &s;ending them to you for the u&s;e to which you informed me it was your de&s;ire to de&s;tine them.</P>
<P>My promi&s;e was pledged with the condition, that if the letters were found to contain any thing which &s;hould render them improper for the publick eye, you would di&s;pen&s;e with the performance of it. You will have the goodne&s;s, I am &s;ure, to pardon my recalling this &s;tipulation to your recollection, as I &s;hould be loth to appear negligent of that obligation which is always implied in an epi&s;tolary confidence. In the re&s;ervation of that right I have read them over with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous attention, but have not &s;een in them the &s;lighte&s;t cau&s;e on that ground to with-hold them from you. But, though not on that, yet on another ground I own I feel a little, yet but a little, reluctance to part with them: I mean on that of my own
<PB N="367" REF="369">
credit, which I fear will &s;uffer by the information conveyed by them, that I  was early in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch valuable in&s;tructions for the beneficial employment of the influence of my late &s;tation, and (as it may &s;eem) have &s;o little availed my&s;elf of them. Whether I could, if it were nece&s;&s;ary, defend my&s;elf again&s;t &s;uch an imputation, it little concerns the world to know. I look only to the effect which the&s;e relicks may produce, con&s;idered as evidences of the virtues of their authour: and believing that they will be found to di&s;play an uncommon warmth of private friend&s;hip, and a mind ever attentive to the improvement and exten&s;ion of u&s;eful knowledge, and &s;olicitous for the intere&s;ts of mankind, I can cheerfully &s;ubmit to the little &s;acrifice of my own fame to contribute to the illu&s;tration of &s;o great and venerable a character. They cannot be better applied, for that end, than by being entru&s;ted to your hands. Allow me, with this offering, to infer from it a proof of the very great e&s;teem with which I have the honour to profe&s;s my&s;elf,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I have had but little per&s;onal knowledge of you, I have had enough to make me wi&s;h for more; and though it be now a long time &s;ince I was honoured by your vi&s;it, I had too much plea&s;ure from it to forget it. By tho&s;e whom we delight to remember, we are unwilling to be forgotten; and therefore I cannot omit this opportunity of reviving my&s;elf in your memory by a letter which you will receive from the hands of my friend Mr. Chambers <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Now Sir Robert Chalmers, one of his Maje&s;ty's Judges in India.</NOTE>; a man, who&s;e purity of manners and vigour of mind are &s;ufficient to make every thing welcome that he brings.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="370">
 That this is my only rea&s;on for writing, will be too apparent by the u&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s of my letter to any other purpo&s;e. I have no que&s;tions to a&s;k; not that I want curio&s;ity after either the ancient or pre&s;ent &s;tate of regions, in which have been &s;een all the power and &s;plendour of wide-extended empire; and which, as by &s;ome grant of natural &s;uperiority, &s;upply the re&s;t of the world with almo&s;t all that pride de&s;ires, and luxury enjoys. But my knowledge of them is too &s;canty to furni&s;h me with proper topicks of enquiry; I can only wi&s;h for information; and hope, that a mind compre|hen&s;ive like yours will find lei&s;ure, amid&s;t the cares of your important &s;tation, to enquire into many &s;ubjects of which the European world either thinks not at all, or thinks with deficient intelligence and uncertain conjecture. I &s;hall hope, that he who once intended to increa&s;e the learning of his country by the introduction of the Per&s;ian language, will examine nicely the traditions and hi&s;tories of the Ea&s;t; that he will &s;urvey the wonders of its ancient edifices, and trace the ve&s;tiges of its ruined cities; and that, at his return, we &s;hall know the arts and opinions of a race of men, from whom very little has been hitherto derived.</P>
<P>You, Sir, have no need of being told by me, how much may be added by your attention and patronage to experimental knowledge and natural hi&s;tory. There are arts of manufacture practi&s;ed in the countries in which you pre&s;ide, which are yet very imperfectly known here, either to artificers or philo&s;ophers. Of the natural productions, animate and inanimate, we yet have &s;o little intelligence, that our books are filled, I fear, with conjectures about things which an Indian pea&s;ant knows by his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>Many of tho&s;e things my fir&s;t wi&s;h is to &s;ee; my &s;econd to know by &s;uch accounts as a man like you will be able to give.</P>
<P>As I have not &s;kill to a&s;k proper que&s;tions, I have likewi&s;e no &s;uch acce&s;s to great men as can enable me to &s;end you any political informa|tion. Of the agitations of an un&s;ettled government, and the &s;truggles of a feeble mini&s;try, care is doubtle&s;s taken to give you more exact accounts than I can obtain. If you are inclined to intere&s;t your&s;elf much in publick tran&s;actions, it is no misfortune to you to be &s;o di&s;tant from them.</P>
<P>That literature is not totally for&s;aking us, and that your favourite language is not neglected, will appear from the book <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Jone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">'s <Q REND="inline">"Per&s;ian Grammar."</Q></NOTE>, which I &s;hould have plea&s;ed my&s;elf more with &s;ending, if I could have pre&s;ented it bound; but

time was wanting. I beg, however, Sir, that you will accept it from a  man very de&s;irous of your regard; and that if you think me able to gratify you by any thing more important, you will employ me.</P>
<P>I am now going to take leave, perhaps a very long leave, of my dear Mr. Chambers. That he is going to live where you govern, may ju&s;tly alleviate the regret of parting; and the hope of &s;eeing both him and you again, which I am not willing to mingle with doubt, mu&s;t at pre&s;ent, comfort as it can,</P>

Mr. Langton &s;aw him one day, in a fit of ab&s;ence, by a &s;udden &s;tart, drive the load off a porter's back, and walk forward bri&s;kly, without being con&s;cious of what he had done. The porter was very angry, but &s;tood &s;till, and eyed the huge figure with much earne&s;t|ne&s;s, till he was &s;atisfied that his wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e was to be quiet, and take up his burthen again.</P>
<P>Our accidental meeting in the &s;treet after a long &s;eparation was a plea&s;ing &s;urprize to us both. He &s;tepped a&s;ide with me into Falcon-court, and made kind inquiries about my family, and as we were in a hurry going different ways, I promi&s;ed to call on him next day; he &s;aid he was engaged to go out in the morning. <Q REND="inline">"Early, Sir."</Q> &s;aid I. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, a London morning does not go with the &s;un."</Q></P>
<P>I waited on him next evening, and he gave me a quantity of his original manu&s;cript of his <Q REND="inline">"Lives of the Poets,"</Q> which he had pre&s;erved for me.</P>
<P>I found that his friend, Mr. Thrale, was now very ill, and had removed, I &s;uppo&s;e by the &s;olicitation of Mrs. Thrale, to a hou&s;e in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare. I was &s;orry to find him &s;adly changed in his appearance.</P>
<P>He told me I might now have the plea&s;ure to &s;ee Dr. John&s;on drink wine again, for he had lately returned to it. When I mentioned this to John&s;on, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I drink it now &s;ometimes, but not &s;ocially."</Q> The fir&s;t evening that I was with him at Thrale's, I ob&s;erved he poured a quantity of it into a large gla&s;s, and &s;wallowed it greedily. Every thing about his character and manners was forcible and violent; there never was any moderation; many a day did he fa&s;t, many a year did he refrain from wine; but when he did eat, it was voraciou&s;ly; when he did drink wine, it was copiou&s;ly. He could practi&s;e ab&s;tinence, but not temperance.</P>

Now, Sir, there are people whom one &s;hould like very well to drop, but would not wi&s;h to be dropped by."</Q> He certainly was vain of the &s;ociety of ladies, and could make him&s;elf very agreeable to them when he cho&s;e it; Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds agreed with me that he could. Mr. Gibbon, with his u&s;ual &s;neer, controverted it, perhaps in re&s;entment of John&s;on's having talked with &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t of his ugline&s;s, which one &s;hould think a <HI>philo&s;opher</HI> would not mind. Dean Marlay wittily ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"A lady may be vain when &s;he can turn a wolf-dog into a lap-dog."</Q></P>
<P>The election for Ayr&s;hire, my own county, was this &s;pring tried upon a petition, before a Committee of the Hou&s;e of Commons. I was one of the Coun&s;el for the &s;itting member, and took the liberty of previou&s;ly &s;tating different points to John&s;on, who never failed to &s;ee them clearly, and to &s;upply me with &s;ome good hints. He dictated to me the following note upon the regi&s;tration of deeds:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"ALL laws are made for the convenience of the community; what is legally done, &s;hould be legally recorded, that the &s;tate of things may be
<PB N="373" REF="375" MS="y">
known, and that wherever evidence is requi&s;ite, evidence may be had. For  this rea&s;on, the obligation to frame and e&s;tabli&s;h a legal regi&s;ter is enforced by a legal penalty, which penalty is the want of that perfection and plenitude of right which a regi&s;ter would give. Thence it follows, that this is not an objection merely legal; for the rea&s;on on which the law &s;tands being equitable, makes it an equitable objection."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This (&s;aid he) you mu&s;t enlarge on, when &s;peaking to the Committee. You mu&s;t not argue there, as if you were arguing in the &s;chools; clo&s;e rea&s;oning will not fix their attention; you mu&s;t &s;ay the &s;ame thing over and over again, in different words. If you &s;ay it but once, they mi&s;s it in a moment of inattention. It is unju&s;t, Sir, to cen&s;ure lawyers for multiplying words when they argue; it is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for them to multiply words."</Q></P>
<P>His notion of the duty of a member of Parliament, &s;itting upon an election committee was very high; and when he was told of a gentleman upon one of tho&s;e committees, who read the new&s;papers part of the time, and &s;lept the re&s;t, while the merits of a vote were examined by the coun&s;el, and as an excu&s;e, when challenged by the chairman for &s;uch behaviour, bluntly an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"I had made up my mind upon that ca&s;e."</Q> John&s;on, with an indignant contempt, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If he was &s;uch a rogue as to make up his mind upon a ca&s;e without hearing it, he &s;hould not have been &s;uch a fool as to tell it."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I think (&s;aid Mr. Dudley Long) the Doctor has pretty plainly made him out to be both rogue and fool."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on's profound reverence for the Hierarchy made him expect from Bi&s;hops the highe&s;t degree of decorum; he was offended even at their going to taverns; <Q REND="inline">"A bi&s;hop (&s;aid he) has nothing to do at a tippling-hou&s;e. It is not indeed immoral in him to go to a tavern; neither would it be immoral in him to whip a top in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare. But, if he did, I hope the boys would fall upon him and apply the whip to <HI>him.</HI> There are gradations in conduct; there is morality&mdash;decency&mdash;propriety. None of the&s;e &s;hould be violated by a bi&s;hop. A bi&s;hop &s;hould not go to a hou&s;e where he may meet a young fellow leading out a wench."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, every tavern does not admit women."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Depend upon it, Sir, any tavern will admit a well-dre&s;t man and a well-dre&s;t woman; they will not perhaps admit a woman whom they &s;ee every night walking by their door, in the &s;treet. But a well-dre&s;t man may lead in a well-dre&s;t woman to any tavern in London. Taverns &s;ell meat and drink, and will &s;ell them to any body who can eat and can drink. You may as well &s;ay that a mercer will not &s;ell &s;ilks to a woman of the town."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="376" MS="y">
 He al&s;o di&s;approved of bi&s;hops going to routs, at lea&s;t of their &s;taying at them longer than their pre&s;ence commanded re&s;pect. He mentioned a particular bi&s;hop. <Q REND="inline">"Poh (&s;aid Mrs. Thrale) the Bi&s;hop of&mdash;is never minded at a rout."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"When a Bi&s;hop places him&s;elf in a &s;ituation where he has no di&s;tinct character, and is of no con&s;equence, he degrades the dignity of his order."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Bo&s;well, Madam, has &s;aid it as correctly as could be."</Q></P>
<P>Nor was it only in the dignitaries of the Church that John&s;on required a particular decorum and delicacy of behaviour; he ju&s;tly con&s;idered that the clergy, as men &s;et apart for the &s;acred office of &s;erving at the altar, and impre&s;&s;ing the minds of men with the aweful concerns of a future &s;tate, &s;hould be &s;omewhat more &s;erious than the generality of mankind, and have a &s;uitable compo&s;ure of manners. A due &s;en&s;e of the dignity of their profe&s;&s;ion, independent of higher motives, will ever prevent them from lo&s;ing their di&s;tinction in an indi&s;criminate &s;ociality; and did &s;uch as affect this, know how much it le&s;&s;ens them in the eyes of tho&s;e whom they think to plea&s;e by it, they would feel them&s;elves much mortified.</P>
<P>John&s;on, and his friend, Beauclerk, were once together in company with &s;everal clergymen, who thought they &s;hould appear to advantage, by a&s;&s;uming the lax jollity of <HI>men of the world;</HI> which, as it may be ob&s;erved in &s;imilar ca&s;es, they carried to noi&s;y exce&s;s. John&s;on, who they expected would be <HI>enter|tained,</HI> &s;ate grave and &s;ilent for &s;ome time; at la&s;t, turning to Beauclerk, he &s;aid, by no means in a whi&s;per, <Q REND="inline">"This merriment of par&s;ons is mighty offen&s;ive."</Q></P>
<P>Even the dre&s;s of a clergyman &s;hould be in character, and nothing can be more de&s;picable than conceited at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">empts at avoiding the appearance of the clerical order; attempts, which are as ineffectual as they are pitiful. Dr. Porteus, now Bi&s;hop of London, in his excellent charge when pre&s;iding over the dioce&s;e of Che&s;ter, ju&s;tly animadverts upon this &s;ubject; and ob&s;erves of a reverend &s;op, that he <Q REND="inline">"can be but <HI>half a beau.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Addi&s;on, in <Q REND="inline">"The Spectator,"</Q> has given us a fine portrait of a clergy|man, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a member of his <HI>Club;</HI> and John&s;on has ex|hibited a model, in the character of Mr. Mudge <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Vol. I. p. 206.</NOTE>, which has e&s;caped the collectors of his works, but which he owned to me, and which indeed he &s;hewed to Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds at the time when it was written. It bears the genuine marks of John&s;on's be&s;t manner, and is as follows:</P>
<Q><PB N="375" REF="377" MS="y"><P>The Reverend Mr. <HI>Zachariah Mudge,</HI> Prebendary of Exeter, and Vicar  of St. Andrews in Plymouth; a man equally eminent for his virtues and abilities, and at once beloved as a companion and reverenced as a pa&s;tor. He had that general curio&s;ity to which no kind of knowledge is indifferent or &s;uperfluous; and that general benevolence by which no order of men is hated or de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>His principles both of thought and action were great and comprehen&s;ive. By a &s;olicitous examination of objections, and judicious compari&s;on of oppo&s;ite arguments, he attained what enquiry never gives but to indu&s;try and per&s;picuity, a firm and un&s;haken &s;ettlement of conviction. But his firmne&s;s was without a&s;perity; for, knowing with how much difficulty truth was &s;ometimes found, he did not wonder that many mi&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>The general cour&s;e of his life was determined by his profe&s;&s;ion; he &s;tudied the &s;acred volumes in the original languages; with what diligence and &s;ucce&s;s, his <HI>Notes upon the P&s;alms</HI> give &s;ufficient evidence. He once endea|voured to add the knowledge of Arabick to that of Hebrew; but finding his thoughts too much diverted from other &s;tudies, after &s;ome time, de&s;i&s;ted from his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>His di&s;charge of parochial duties was exemplary. How his <HI>Sermons</HI> were compo&s;ed, may be learned from the excellent volume which he has given to the publick; but how they were delivered, can be known only to tho&s;e that heard them, for as he appeared in the pulpit, words will not ea&s;ily de&s;cribe him. His delivery, though uncon&s;trained was not negligent, and though forcible was not turbulent; di&s;daining anxious nicety of empha&s;is, and laboured artifice of action, it captivated the hearer by its natural dignity, it rou&s;ed the &s;luggi&s;h, and fixed the volatile, and detained the mind upon the &s;ubject, without directing it to the &s;peaker.</P>
<P>The grandeur and &s;olemnity of the preacher did not intrude upon his general behaviour; at the table of his friends he was a companion com|municative and attentive, of unaffected manners, of manly cheerfulne&s;s, willing to plea&s;e, and ea&s;y to be plea&s;ed. His acquaintance was univer&s;ally &s;olicited, and his pre&s;ence ob&s;tructed no enjoyment which religion did not forbid. Though &s;tudious he was popular; though argumentative he was mode&s;t; though inflexible he was candid; and though metaphy&s;ical yet orthodox <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"London Chronicle,"</Q> May 2, 1769.

<P><PB N="376" REF="378" MS="y">
 On Friday, March 30, I dined with him at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's, with the Earl of Charlemont, Sir Anne&s;ley Stewart, Mr. Eliot, of Port-Eliot, Mr. Burke, Dean Marlay, now Bi&s;hop of Clonfert, Mr. Langton; a mo&s;t agreeable day, of which I regret that every circum&s;tance is not pre&s;erved; but it is unrea&s;onable to require &s;uch a multiplication of felicity.</P>
<P>Mr. Eliot, with whom Dr. Walter Harte had travelled, talked to us of his <Q REND="inline">"Hi&s;tory of Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,"</Q> which he &s;aid was a very good book in the German tran&s;lation. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Harte was exce&s;&s;ively vain. He put copies of his book in manu&s;cript into the hands of Lord Che&s;terfield and Lord Granville, that they might revi&s;e it. Now, how ab&s;urd was it to &s;uppo&s;e that two &s;uch noblemen would revi&s;e &s;o big a manu&s;cript. Poor man! he left London the day of the publication of his book, that he might be out of the way of the great prai&s;e he was to receive; and he was a&s;hamed to return, when he found how ill his book had &s;ucceeded. It was unlucky in coming out on the &s;ame day with Robert&s;on's 'Hi&s;tory of Scotland.' His hu&s;bandry, however, is good."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"So he was fitter for that than for heroick hi&s;tory. He did well when he turned his &s;word into a plough|&s;hare."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Eliot mentioned a curious liquor peculiar to his country, which the Corni&s;h fi&s;hermen drink. They call it <HI>Mahogany;</HI> and it is made of two parts gin, and one part treacle, well beat together. I begged to have &s;ome of it made, which was done with proper &s;kill by Mr. Eliot. I thought it very good liquor; and &s;aid it was a counterpart of what is called <HI>Athol Porridge</HI> in the Highlands of Scotland, which is a mixture of whi&s;ky and honey. John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"that mu&s;t be a better liquor than the Corni&s;h, for both its component parts are better."</Q> He al&s;o ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Mahogany</HI> mu&s;t be a modern name; for it was not long &s;ince the wood called mahogany was known in this country."</Q> I mentioned his &s;cale of liquors;&mdash;claret for boys&mdash;port for men&mdash;brandy for heroes. <Q REND="inline">"Then (&s;aid Mr. Burke) let me have claret: I love to be a boy; to have the carele&s;s gaiety of boyi&s;h days."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould drink claret too, if it would give me that; but it does not: it neither makes boys men, nor men boys. You'll be drowned by it before it has any effect upon you."</Q></P>
<P>I ventured to mention a ludicrous paragraph in the news-papers, that Dr. John&s;on was learning to dance of Ve&s;tris. Lord Charlemont, wi&s;hing to excite him to talk, propo&s;ed, in a whi&s;per, that he &s;hould be a&s;ked, whether it was true. <Q REND="inline">"Shall I a&s;k him?"</Q> &s;aid his Lord&s;hip. We were, by a great majority, clear for the experiment. Upon which his Lord&s;hip very gravely
<PB N="377" REF="379" MS="y">
and with a courteous air &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, is it true that you are taking  le&s;&s;ons of Ve&s;tris?"</Q> This was ri&s;king a good deal, and required the boldne&s;s of a General of Iri&s;h Volunteers to make the attempt. John&s;on was at fir&s;t &s;tartled, and in &s;ome heat an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"How can your Lord&s;hip a&s;k &s;o &s;imple a que&s;tion?"</Q> But immediately recovering him&s;elf, whether from unwillingne&s;s to be deceived, or to appear deceived, or whether from real good humour, he kept up the joke: <Q REND="inline">"Nay, but if any body were to an&s;wer the paragraph, and contradict it, I'd have a reply, and would &s;ay, that he who contradicted it was no friend either to Ve&s;tris or me. For why &s;hould not Dr. John&s;on add to his other powers a little corporeal agility? Socrates learnt to dance at an advanced age, and Cato learnt Greek at an advanced age. Then it might proceed to &s;ay, that this John&s;on, not content with dancing on the ground, might dance on the rope; and they might introduce the elephant dancing on the rope. A nobleman wrote a play, called 'Love in a hollow Tree.' He found out that it was a bad one, and therefore wi&s;hed to buy up all the copies, and burn them. The Duche&s;s of Marlborough had kept one; and when he was again&s;t her at an election, &s;he had a new edition of it printed, and prefixed to it, as a fronti&s;piece, an elephant dancing on a rope; to &s;hew, that his Lord&s;hip's writing comedy was as aukward as an elephant dancing on a rope."</Q></P>
<P>On Sunday, April 1, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale's, with Sir Philip Jennings Clerk and Mr. Perkins, who had the &s;uperintendence of Mr. Thrale's brewery, with a &s;alary of five hundred pounds a year. Sir Philip had the appearance of a gentleman of ancient family, well advanced in life. He wore his own white hair in a bag of goodly &s;ize, a black velvet coat, with an embroidered wai&s;tcoat, and very rich laced ruffles; which Mrs. Thrale &s;aid were old fa&s;hioned, but which, for that rea&s;on, I thought the more re&s;pectable, more like a Tory; yet Sir Philip was then in oppo&s;ition in parliament. <Q REND="inline">"Ah, Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) ancient ruffles and modern principles do not agree."</Q> Sir Philip defended the oppo&s;ition to the American war ably and with temper, and I joined him. He &s;aid, the majority of the nation was again&s;t the mini&s;try. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I,</HI> Sir, am again&s;t the mini&s;try; but it is for having too little of that of which oppo&s;ition thinks they have too much. Were I mini&s;ter, if any man wagged his finger again&s;t me, he &s;hould be turned out; for that which it is in the power of Government to give at plea&s;ure to one or to another, &s;hould be given to the &s;upporters of Govern|ment. If you will not oppo&s;e at the expence of lo&s;ing your place, your oppo&s;ition will not be hone&s;t, you will feel no &s;erious grievance; and the
<PB N="378" REF="380" MS="y">
 pre&s;ent oppo&s;ition is only a conte&s;t to get what others have. Sir Robert Walpole acted as I would do. As to the American war, the <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> of the nation is <HI>with</HI> the mini&s;try. The majority of tho&s;e who can <HI>under&s;tand</HI> is with it; the majority of tho&s;e who can only <HI>hear</HI> is again&s;t it; and as tho&s;e who can only hear are more numerous than tho&s;e who can under&s;tand, and oppo|&s;ition is always loude&s;t, a majority of the rabble will be for oppo&s;ition."</Q></P>
<P>This boi&s;terous vivacity entertained us; but the fact really was, that tho&s;e who could under&s;tand the be&s;t were again&s;t the American war, as almo&s;t every man now is, when the que&s;tion has been coolly con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Mrs. Thrale gave high prai&s;e to a gentleman of our acquaintance. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, my dear lady, don't talk &s;o. Mr. ****'s character is very <HI>&s;hort.</HI> It is nothing. He fills a chair. He is a man of a genteel appearance, and that is all. I know nobody who bla&s;ts by prai&s;e as you do: for whenever there is exaggerated prai&s;e, every body is &s;et again&s;t a character. They are provoked to attack it. Now there is *****: you prai&s;ed that man with &s;uch di&s;proportion, that I was incited to le&s;&s;en him, perhaps more than he de&s;erves. His blood is upon your head. By the &s;ame principle, your malice defeats it&s;elf; for your cen&s;ure is too violent. And yet (looking to her with a leering &s;mile) &s;he is the fir&s;t woman in the world could &s;he but re&s;train that wicked tongue of hers&mdash;&s;he would be the only woman could &s;he but command that little whirligig."</Q></P>
<P>Upon the &s;ubject of exaggerated prai&s;e I took the liberty to &s;ay, that I thought there might be very high prai&s;e given to a known character which de&s;erved it, and therefore it would not be exaggerated. Thus, one might &s;ay of Mr. Edmund Burke, He is a very wonderful man. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, you would not be &s;afe if another man had a mind perver&s;ely to contra|dict. He might an&s;wer, Where is all the wonder? Burke is, to be &s;ure, a man of uncommon abilities, with a great quantity of matter in his mind, and a great fluency of language in his mouth. But we are not be &s;tunned and a&s;toni&s;hed by him. So you &s;ee, Sir, even Burke would &s;uffer, not from any fault of his own, but from your folly."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Thrale mentioned a gentleman who had acquired a fortune of four thou&s;and a year in trade, but was ab&s;olutely mi&s;erable, becau&s;e he could not talk in company; &s;o mi&s;erable, that he was impelled to lament his &s;ituation in the &s;treet to ******, whom he hates, and who he knows de&s;pi&s;es him. <Q REND="inline">"I am a mo&s;t unhappy man (&s;aid he). I am invited to conver&s;ations. I go to conver&s;ations; but, alas! I have no conver&s;ation."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Man commonly cannot be &s;ucce&s;sful in different ways. This gentleman has &s;pent,
<PB N="379" REF="381" MS="y">
in getting four thou&s;and pounds a year, the time in which he might have  learnt to talk; and now he cannot talk."</Q> Mr. Perkins made a &s;hrewd and droll remark: <Q REND="inline">"If he had got his four thou&s;and a year as a mountebank, he might have learnt to talk at the &s;ame time that he was getting his fortune."</Q></P>
<P>Some other gentlemen came in. The conver&s;ation concerning the per&s;on who&s;e character Dr. John&s;on had treated &s;o &s;lightingly, as he did not know his merit, was re&s;umed. Mrs. Thrale &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You think &s;o of him, Sir, becau&s;e he is quiet, and does not exert him&s;elf with force. You'll be &s;aying the &s;ame thing of Mr. ***** there, who &s;its as quiet&mdash;"</Q> This was not well bred; and John&s;on did not let it pa&s;s without correction. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Madam, what right have you to talk thus? Both Mr. ***** and I have rea&s;on to take it ill. <HI>You</HI> may talk &s;o of Mr. *****: but why do you make <HI>me</HI> do it. Have I &s;aid any thing again&s;t Mr. *****. You have <HI>&s;et</HI> him, that I might &s;hoot him: but I have not &s;hot him."</Q></P>
<P>One of the gentlemen &s;aid, he had &s;een three folio volumes of Dr. John&s;on's &s;ayings collected by me. <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t put you right, Sir (&s;aid I); for I am very exact in authenticity. You could not &s;ee folio volumes, for I have none: you might have &s;een &s;ome in quarto and octavo. This is inattention which one &s;hould guard again&s;t."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is a want of concern about veracity. He does not know that he &s;aw <HI>any</HI> volumes. If he had &s;een them he could have remembered their &s;ize."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Thrale appeared very lethargick to-day. I &s;aw him again on Monday evening, at which time he was not thought to be in immediate danger; but early in the morning of Wedne&s;day the 4th, he expired. John&s;on was in the hou&s;e, and thus mentions the event: <Q REND="inline">"I felt almo&s;t the la&s;t flutter of his pul&s;e, and looked for the la&s;t time upon the face that for fifteen years had never been turned upon me but with re&s;pect and benignity <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 191.</NOTE>."</Q> Upon that day there was a <HI>Call</HI> of the LITERARY CLUB; but John&s;on apologi&s;ed for his ab&s;ence by the following note:</P>

 Mr. Thrale's death was a very e&s;&s;ential lo&s;s to John&s;on, who, although he did not fore&s;ee all that afterwards happened, was &s;ufficiently convinced that the comforts which Mr. Thrale's family afforded him would now in a great mea&s;ure cea&s;e. He, however, continued to &s;hew a kind attention to his widow and children as long as it was acceptable; and he took upon him, with a very earne&s;t concern, the office of one of his executors, the importance of which &s;eemed greater than u&s;ual to him, from his circum&s;tances having been always &s;uch that he had &s;carcely any &s;hare in the real bu&s;ine&s;s of life. His friends of the CLUB were in hopes that Mr. Thrale might have made a liberal provi&s;ion for him for his life, which, as Mr. Thrale left no &s;on, and a very large fortune, it would have been highly to his honour to have done; and, con&s;idering Dr. John&s;on's age, could not have been of long duration: but he bequeathed him only two hundred pounds, which was the legacy given to each of his executors. I could not but be &s;omewhat diverted by hearing John&s;on talk in a pompous manner of his new office, and particularly of the concerns of the brewery, which it was at la&s;t re&s;olved &s;hould be &s;old. Lord Lucan tells a very good &s;tory, which, if not preci&s;ely exact, is certainly characteri&s;tical: that when the &s;ale of Thrale's brewery was going forward, John&s;on appeared bu&s;tling about, with an ink-horn and pen in his button-hole, like an exci&s;e|man; and on being a&s;ked what he really con&s;idered to be the value of the property which was to be di&s;po&s;ed of, an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"We are not here to &s;ell a parcel of boilers and vats, but the potentiality of growing rich, beyond the dreams of avarice."</Q></P>
<P>On Friday, April 6, he carried me to dine at a club, which, at his de&s;ire, had been lately formed at the Queen's Arms, in St. Paul's Church-yard. He told Mr. Hoole, that he wi&s;hed to have a <HI>City Club,</HI> and a&s;ked him to collect one; but, &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"Don't let them be <HI>patriots.</HI>"</Q> The company to-day were very &s;en&s;ible well-behaved men. I have pre&s;erved only two particulars of his conver&s;ation. He &s;aid, he was glad Lord George Gordon had e&s;caped, rather than that a precedent &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed for hanging a man for <HI>con&s;tructive trea&s;on;</HI> which, in con&s;i&s;tency with his true, manly, con&s;titutional Toryi&s;m, he con&s;idered would be a dangerous engine of arbi|trary power. And upon its being mentioned that an opulent and very indolent Scotch nobleman, who totally re&s;igned the management of his affairs to a man of knowledge and abilities, had claimed &s;ome merit by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"The next be&s;t thing to managing a man's own affairs well, is being &s;en&s;ible of incapacity, and not attempting it, but having full confidence in one who can do it."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, this is paltry. There is a
<PB N="381" REF="383" MS="y">
middle cour&s;e. Let a man give application, and depend upon it he will &s;oon  get above a de&s;picable &s;tate of helple&s;&s;ne&s;s, and attain the power of acting for him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>On Saturday, April 7, I dined with him at Mr. Hoole's, with Governour Boucher and Captain Orme, both of whom had been long in the Ea&s;t-Indies; and being men of good &s;en&s;e and ob&s;ervation, were very entertaining. John&s;on defended the oriental regulation of different <HI>ca&s;ts</HI> of men, which was objected to as totally de&s;tructive of the hopes of ri&s;ing in &s;ociety by per&s;onal merit. He &s;hewed that there was a <HI>principle</HI> in it &s;ufficiently plau&s;ible by analogy. <Q REND="inline">"We &s;ee (&s;aid he) in metals that there are different &s;pecies; and &s;o likewi&s;e in animals, though one &s;pecies may not differ very widely from another, as in the &s;pecies of dogs&mdash;the cur, the &s;paniel, the ma&s;tiff. The Bramins are the ma&s;tiffs of mankind."</Q></P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, April 12, I dined with him at a Bi&s;hop's, where were Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Mr. Berrenger, and &s;ome more company. He had dined the day before at another Bi&s;hop's. I have unfortunately recorded none of his conver&s;ation at the Bi&s;hop's where we dined together: but I have pre&s;erved his ingenious defence of his dining twice abroad in Pa&s;&s;ion-week; a laxity, in which I am convinced he would not have indulged him&s;elf at the time when he wrote his &s;olemn paper in <Q REND="inline">"The Rambler,"</Q> upon that aweful &s;ea&s;on. It appeared to me, that by being much more in company, and enjoying more in luxurious living, he had contracted a keener reli&s;h of plea&s;ure, and was con&s;equently le&s;s rigorous in his religious rites. This he would not acknowledge; but he rea&s;oned, with admirable &s;ophi&s;try, as follows: <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, a Bi&s;hop's calling company together in this week, is, to u&s;e the vulgar phra&s;e, not <HI>the thing.</HI> But you mu&s;t con&s;ider laxity is a bad thing; but preci&s;ene&s;s is al&s;o a bad thing; and your general character may be more hurt by preci&s;ene&s;s than by dining with a Bi&s;hop in Pa&s;&s;ion-week. There might be a handle for reflection. It might be &s;aid, 'He refu&s;ed to dine with a Bi&s;hop in Pa&s;&s;ion-week, but was three Sundays ab&s;ent from church."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Very true, Sir. But &s;uppo&s;e a man to be uniformly of good conduct, would it not be better that he &s;hould refu&s;e to dine with a Bi&s;hop in this week, and &s;o not encourage a bad practice by his example?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, you are to con&s;ider whether you might not do more harm by le&s;&s;ening the influence of a Bi&s;hop's character by your di&s;approbation in refu&s;ing him, than by going to him."</Q></P>

<P>On Friday, April 13, being Good-Friday, I went to St. Clement's-church with him, as u&s;ual. There I &s;aw again his old fellow-collegian, Edwards, to whom I &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I think Sir, Dr. John&s;on and you meet only at church."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sir (&s;aid he) it is the be&s;t place we can meet in except Heaven, and I hope we &s;hall meet there too."</Q> Dr. John&s;on told me that there was very little com|munication between Edwards and him, after their unexpected renewal of acquaintance. <Q REND="inline">"But (&s;aid he, &s;miling) he met me once, and &s;aid, 'I am told you have written a very pretty book called <HI>The Rambler.'</HI> I was un|willing that he &s;hould leave the world in total darkne&s;s, and &s;ent him a &s;et."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berrenger vi&s;ited him to-day, and was very plea&s;ing. We talked of an evening &s;ociety for conver&s;ation at a hou&s;e in town, of which we were all members, but of which John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It will never do, Sir. There is nothing &s;erved about there, neither tea, nor coffee, nor lemonade, nor any
<PB N="383" REF="385" MS="y">
thing whatever; and depend upon it, Sir, a man does not love to go to a  place from whence he comes out exactly as he went in.</Q> I endeavoured for argument's &s;ake, to maintain that men of learning and talents might have very good intellectual &s;ociety, without the aid of any little gratifications of the &s;en&s;es. Berrenger joined with John&s;on, and &s;aid that without the&s;e any meeting would be dull and in&s;ipid. He would therefore have all the &s;light refre&s;hments; nay, it would not be ami&s;s to have &s;ome cold meat, and a bottle of wine upon a &s;ide-board. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on to me, with an air of triumph,) Mr. Berrenger knows the world. Every body loves to have good things furni&s;hed to them without any trouble. I told Mrs. Thrale once, that as &s;he did not choo&s;e to have card-tables, &s;he &s;hould have a profu&s;ion of the be&s;t &s;weetmeats, and &s;he would be &s;ure to have company enough come to her."</Q> The event proved the ju&s;tice of John&s;on's opinion, as to the im|practicability of getting people to meet, when they know there is ab&s;olutely nothing to touch the palate; for this Society, though held at the hou&s;e of a per&s;on de&s;ervedly much e&s;teemed, and compo&s;ed of very eminent men, could not be pre&s;erved from gradual decay.</P>
<P>On Sunday, April 15, being Ea&s;ter-day, after &s;olemn wor&s;hip in St. Paul's church, I found him alone; Dr. Scott, of the Commons, came. He talked of its having been &s;aid, that Addi&s;on wrote &s;ome of his be&s;t papers in <Q REND="inline">"The Spectator,"</Q> when warm with wine. Dr. John&s;on did not &s;eem willing to admit this. Dr. Scott, as a confirmation of it related, that Black&s;tone compo&s;ed his <Q REND="inline">"Commentaries"</Q> with a bottle of port before him.</P>
<P>I told him, that in a company where I had lately been, a de&s;ire was expre&s;&s;ed to know his authority for the &s;hocking &s;tory of Addi&s;on's &s;ending an execution into Steele's hou&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"Sir (&s;aid he) it is generally known, it is known to all who are acquainted with the literary hi&s;tory of that period. It is as well known, as that he wrote 'Cato."</Q> Mr. Thomas Sheridan once defended Addi&s;on to me, by alledging that he did it in order to cover Steele's goods from other creditors, who were going to &s;eize them.</P>
<P>We talked of the difference between the mode of education at Oxford, and that in the Colleges, where in&s;truction is chiefly conveyed by lectures. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Lectures were once u&s;eful; but now, when all can read, and books are &s;o numerous, lectures are unnece&s;&s;ary. If your attention fails, and you mi&s;s a part of a lecture, it is lo&s;t, you cannot go back as you do upon a book."</Q> Dr. Scott agreed with him. <Q REND="inline">"But yet (&s;aid I) Dr. Scott, you your&s;elf gave lectures at Oxford."</Q> He &s;miled. <Q REND="inline">"You laughed then (&s;aid I) at tho&s;e who came to you."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="386" MS="y">
 Dr. Scott left us, and &s;oon afterwards we went to dinner. Our company con&s;i&s;ted of Mrs. Williams, Mrs. De&s;moulins, Mr. Levett, Mr. Allen, the printer, and Mrs. Hall, &s;i&s;ter of the Reverend Mr. John We&s;ley, and re&s;embling him, as I thought, both in figure and manner. John&s;on produced now, for the fir&s;t time, &s;ome hand&s;ome &s;ilver &s;alvers, which he told me he had bought fourteen years ago; &s;o it was a great day. I was not a little amu&s;ed by ob&s;erving Allen perpetually &s;truggling to talk in the manner of John&s;on, like the little frog in the fable, blowing him&s;elf up to re&s;emble the &s;tately ox.</P>
<P>I mentioned a kind of religious Robinhood Society, which met every Sunday evening, at Coachmakers'-hall, for free debate; and that the &s;ubject for this night was, the text which relates, with other miracles, which hap|pened at our SAVIOUR'S death, <Q REND="inline">"And the graves were opened, and many bodies of the &s;aints which &s;lept aro&s;e, and came out of the graves after his re&s;urrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many."</Q> Mrs. Hall &s;aid it was a very curious &s;ubject, and &s;he &s;hould like to hear it di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. JOHNSON. (&s;omewhat warmly) <Q REND="inline">"One would not go to &s;uch a place to hear it&mdash;one would not be &s;een in &s;uch a place&mdash;to give coun|tenance to &s;uch a meeting."</Q> I, however, re&s;olved that I would go. <Q REND="inline">"But Sir, (&s;aid &s;he to John&s;on,) I &s;hould like to hear <HI>you</HI> di&s;cu&s;s it."</Q> He &s;eemed reluctant to engage in it. She talked of the re&s;urrection of the human race in general, and maintained that we &s;hall be rai&s;ed with the &s;ame bodies. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Madam, we &s;ee that it is not to be the &s;ame body; for the Scripture u&s;es the illu&s;tration of grain &s;own, and we know that the grain which grows is not the &s;ame with what is &s;own. You cannot &s;uppo&s;e that we &s;hall ri&s;e with a di&s;ea&s;ed body; it is enough if there be &s;uch a &s;amene&s;s as to di&s;tingui&s;h identity of per&s;on."</Q> She &s;eemed de&s;irous of knowing more, but he left the que&s;tion in ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>Of apparitions, he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"A total di&s;belief of them is adver&s;e to the opinion of the exi&s;tence of the &s;oul between death and the la&s;t day; the que&s;tion &s;imply is, whether departed &s;pirits ever have the power of making them&s;elves perceptible to us; a man who thinks he has &s;een an apparition, can only be convinced him&s;elf; his authority will not convince another, and his conviction, if rational, mu&s;t be founded on being told &s;omething which cannot be known but by &s;upernatural means."</Q></P>
<P>He mentioned a thing as not unfrequent, of which I had never heard before&mdash;being <HI>called,</HI> that is, hearing one's name pronounced by the voice of a known per&s;on at a great di&s;tance, far beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of being reached
<PB N="385" REF="387" MS="y">
by any &s;ound, uttered by human organs. <Q REND="inline">"An acquaintance, on who&s;e  veracity I can depend, told me, that walking home one evening to Kilmar|nock, he heard him&s;elf called from a wood, by the voice of a brother who had gone to America; and the next packet brought accounts of that brother's death."</Q> Macbean a&s;&s;erted that this inexplicable <HI>calling</HI> was a thing very well known. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, that one day at Oxford, as he was turning the key of his chamber, he heard his mother di&s;tinctly call <HI>Sam.</HI> She was then at Lichfield; but nothing en&s;ued. This phaenomenon is, I think, as wonderful as any other my&s;terious fact, which many people are very &s;low to believe, or rather, indeed, reject with an ob&s;tinate contempt.</P>
<P>Some time after this, upon his making a remark which e&s;caped my attention, Mrs. Williams and Mrs. Hall were both together &s;triving to an&s;wer him. He grew angry, and called out loudly, <Q REND="inline">"Nay, when you both &s;peak at once it is intolerable."</Q> But checking him&s;elf, and &s;oftening, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"This one may &s;ay, though you <HI>are</HI> ladies."</Q> Then he brightened into gay humour, and addre&s;&s;ed them in the words of one of the &s;ongs in <Q REND="inline">"The Beggar's Opera,"</Q>
<Q><L>"But two at a time there's no mortal can bear."</L></Q>
<Q REND="inline">"What, Sir, (&s;aid I,) are you going to turn Captain Macheath?"</Q> There was &s;omething as plea&s;antly ludicrous in this &s;cene as can be imagined. The contra&s;t between Macheath, Polly, and Lucy&mdash;and Dr. Samuel John&s;on, blind, peevi&s;h Mrs. Williams, and lean, lank, preaching Mrs. Hall, was exqui&s;ite.</P>
<P>I &s;tole away to Coachmaker's-hall, and heard the difficult text of which we had talked, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with great decency, and &s;ome intelligence, by &s;everal &s;peakers. There was a difference of opinion as to the appearance of gho&s;ts in modern times, though the arguments for it, &s;upported by Mr. Addi&s;on's authority, preponderated. The immediate &s;ubject of debate was embarra&s;&s;ed by the <HI>bodies</HI> of the &s;aints having been &s;aid to ri&s;e, and by the que&s;tion what became of them afterwards; did they return again to their graves? Or were they tran&s;lated to Heaven? Only one evangeli&s;t mentions the fact <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">St. Matthew, chap. xxvii. v. 52, 53.</NOTE>, and the commentators whom I have looked at, do not make the pa&s;&s;age clear. There is, however, no occa&s;ion for our under&s;tanding it farther, than to know that it was one of the extraordinary manife&s;tations of divine power, which accompanied the mo&s;t important event that ever happened.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="388">
 On Friday, April 20, I &s;pent with him one of the happie&s;t days that I remember to have enjoyed in the whole cour&s;e of my life. Mrs. Garrick, who&s;e grief for the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band was, I believe, as &s;incere as wounded affection and admiration could produce, had this day, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince his death, a &s;elect party of his friends to dine with her. The company was Mi&s;s Hannah More, who lived with her, and whom &s;he called her Chaplain; Mrs. Bo&s;cawen, Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Dr. Burney, Dr. John&s;on, and my&s;elf. We found our&s;elves very elegantly entertained at her hou&s;e in the Adelphi, where I have pa&s;&s;ed many a plea&s;ing hour with him <Q REND="inline">"who gladdened life."</Q> She looked very well, talked of her hu&s;band with complacency, and while &s;he ca&s;t her eyes on his portrait, which hung over the chimney-piece, &s;aid, that <Q REND="inline">"death was now the mo&s;t agreeable object to her."</Q> The very &s;emblance of David Garrick was cheering. Mr. Beauclerk, with happy propriety, in&s;cribed under that fine portrait of him, which by Lady Diana's kindne&s;s is now the property of my friend Mr. Langton, the following pa&s;&s;age from his beloved Shak&s;peare:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"&mdash;A merrier man,</L>
<L>"Within the limit of becoming mirth,</L>
<L>"I never &s;pent an hour's talk withal.</L>
<L>"His eye begets occa&s;ion for his wit;</L>
<L>"For ev'ry object that the one doth catch,</L>
<L>"The other turns to a mirth-moving je&s;t;</L>
<L>"Which his fair tongue (Conceit's expo&s;itor)</L>
<L>"Delivers in &s;uch apt and gracious words,</L>
<L>"That aged ears play truant at his tales,</L>
<L>"And younger hearings are quite ravi&s;hed;</L>
<L>"So &s;weet and voluble is his di&s;cour&s;e."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>We were all in fine &s;pirits; and I whi&s;pered to Mrs. Bo&s;cawen, <Q REND="inline">"I believe this is as much as can be made of life."</Q> In addition to a &s;plendid enter|tainment, we were regaled with Lichfield ale, which had a peculiar appro|priated value. Sir Jo&s;hua, and Dr. Burney, and I, drank cordially of it to Dr. John&s;on's health; and though he would not join us, he as cordially an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen, I wi&s;h you all as well as you do me."</Q></P>
<P>The general effect of this day dwells upon my mind in fond remem|brance; but I do not find much conver&s;ation recorded. What I have pre&s;erved &s;hall be faithfully given.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="389">
Somebody mentioned Mr. Thomas Hollis, the &s;trenuous Whig, who u&s;ed  to &s;end over Europe pre&s;ents of democratical books, with their boards &s;tamped with daggers and caps of liberty. Mrs. Carter &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He was a bad man. He u&s;ed to talk uncharitably."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Poh! poh! Madam; who is the wor&s;e for being talked of uncharitably? Be&s;ides, he was a dull poor creature as ever lived. And I believe he would not have done harm to a man whom he knew to be of very oppo&s;ite principles to his own. I remember once at the Society of Arts, when an adverti&s;ement was to be drawn up, he pointed me out as the man who could do it be&s;t. This, you will ob&s;erve was kindne&s;s to me. I however &s;lipt away and e&s;caped it."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Carter having &s;aid of a certain per&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I doubt he was an Athei&s;t."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I don't know that. He might perhaps have become one, if he had had time to ripen, (&s;miling). He might have <HI>exuberated</HI> into an Athei&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds prai&s;ed <Q REND="inline">"Mudge's Sermons."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Mudge's Sermons' are good, but not practical. He gra&s;ps more &s;en&s;e than he can hold; he takes more corn than he can make into meal; he opens a wide pro&s;pect, but it is &s;o di&s;tant, it is indi&s;tinct. I love 'Blair's Sermons.' Though the dog is a Scotchman, and a Pre&s;byterian, and every thing he &s;hould not be, I was the fir&s;t to prai&s;e them. Such was my candour."</Q> (&s;miling). MRS.

<P>In the evening we had a large company in the drawing-room, &s;everal ladies, the Bi&s;hop of Killaloe, D. Percy, Mr. Chamberlayne, of the Trea&s;ury, &amp;c. &amp;c. Somebody &s;aid the life of a mere literary man could not be very entertaining. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But it certainly may. This is a remark which has been made, and repeated, without ju&s;tice; why &s;hould the life of a literary man be le&s;s entertaining than the life of any other man? Are there not as intere&s;ting varieties in &s;uch a life? As a <HI>literary life</HI> it may be very entertaining."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But it mu&s;t be better &s;urely, when it is diver&s;ified with a little active variety&mdash;&s;uch as his having gone to Jamaica;&mdash;or&mdash;his having gone to the Hebrides."</Q> John&s;on was not di&s;plea&s;ed at this.</P>
<P>Talking of a very re&s;pectable authour, he told us a curious circum&s;tance in his life, which was, that he had married a printer's devil. REYNOLDS. <Q REND="inline">"A printer's devil, Sir! Why, I thought a printer's devil was a creature with a black face and in rags."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir. But I &s;uppo&s;e, he had her face wa&s;hed, and put clean clothes on her. (Then looking very

 &s;erious, and very earne&s;t) And &s;he did not di&s;grace him&mdash;the woman had a bottom of good &s;en&s;e."</Q> The word <HI>bottom</HI> thus introduced, was &s;o ludicrous, when contra&s;ted with his gravity, that mo&s;t of us could not forbear tittering and laughing, though I recollect that the Bi&s;hop of Killaloe kept his coun|tenance with perfect &s;teadine&s;s, while Mi&s;s Hannah More &s;lyly hid her face behind a lady's back who &s;ate on the &s;ame &s;ettee with her. His pride could not bear that any expre&s;&s;ion of his &s;hould excite ridicule, when he did not intend it; he therefore re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume and exerci&s;e de&s;potick power, glanced &s;ternly around, and called out in a &s;trong tone, <Q REND="inline">"Where's the merriment?"</Q> Then collecting him&s;elf, and looking aweful, to make us feel how he could impo&s;e re&s;traint, and as it were &s;earching his mind for a &s;till more ludicrous word, he &s;lowly pronounced, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ay the <HI>woman</HI> was <HI>fundamentally</HI> &s;en&s;ible;"</Q> as if he had &s;aid, hear this now, and laugh if you dare. We all &s;at compo&s;ed as at a funeral.</P>
<P>He and I walked away together; we &s;topped a little while by the rails of the Adelphi, looking on the Thames, and I &s;aid to him with tenderne&s;s, that I thought of two friends we had lo&s;t, who once lived in the buildings behind us, Beauclerk and Garrick. <Q REND="inline">"Aye, Sir, (&s;aid he, tenderly,) and two &s;uch friends as cannot be &s;upplied."</Q></P>
<P>For &s;ome time after this day I did not &s;ee him very often, and of the conver&s;ation which I did enjoy, I am &s;orry to find I have pre&s;erved but little.

<P>One day having &s;poken very freely of tho&s;e who were then in power, he &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"Between our&s;elves, Sir, I do not like to give oppo&s;ition the &s;atisfaction of knowing how much I di&s;approve of the mini&s;try."</Q> And when I mentioned that Mr. Burke had boa&s;ted how quiet the nation was in George the Second's reign, when Whigs were in power, compared with the pre&s;ent reign, when Tories governed. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, (&s;aid he,) you are to con&s;ider that Tories having more reverence for government, will not oppo&s;e with the &s;ame violence as Whigs, who being unre&s;trained by that principle, will oppo&s;e by any means."</Q></P>

Let me, however, coun&s;el you not to wa&s;te your health in unprofitable &s;orrow, but go to Bath, and endeavour to prolong your own life, but when we have all done all that we can, one friend mu&s;t in time lo&s;e the other.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>On Tue&s;day, May 8, I had the plea&s;ure of again dining with him and Mr. Wilkes, at Mr. Dilly's. No <HI>negotiation</HI> was now required to bring them together; for John&s;on was &s;o well &s;atisfied with the former interview, that he was very glad to meet Wilkes again, who was this day &s;eated between Dr. Beattie and Dr. John&s;on; (between Truth and Rea&s;on, as General Paoli &s;aid, when I told him of it). WILKES. <Q REND="inline">"I have been thinking, Dr. John&s;on, that there &s;hould be a bill brought into parliament that the controverted elections for Scotland &s;hould be tried in that country, at their own Abbey of Holy-Rood Hou&s;e, and not here; for the con&s;equence of trying them here is, that we have an inundation of Scotchmen, who come up and never go back again. Now here is Bo&s;well, who has come up upon the election for his own county, which will not la&s;t a fortnight."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why they &s;hould be tried at all; for, you know, one Scotchman is as good as another."</Q> WILKES. <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Bo&s;well, how much may be got in a year by an Advocate at the Scotch bar?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I believe two thou&s;and pounds."</Q> WILKES. <Q REND="inline">"How can it be po&s;&s;ible to &s;pend that money in Scot|land?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, the money may be &s;pent in England: but there is a harder que&s;tion. If one man in Scotland gets po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two thou&s;and pounds, what remains for all the re&s;t of the nation?"</Q> WILKES. <Q REND="inline">"You know, in the la&s;t war, the immen&s;e booty which Thurot carried off
<PB N="390" REF="392" MS="y">
 from the complete plunder of &s;even Scotch i&s;les. He re-imbarked with <HI>three and &s;ix-pence.</HI>"</Q> Here again John&s;on and Wilkes joined in extravagant &s;portive raillery upon the &s;uppo&s;ed poverty of Scotland, which Dr. Beattie and I did not think it worth our while to di&s;pute.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of quotation being introduced, Mr. Wilkes cen&s;ured it as pedantry. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, it is a good thing; there is a community of mind in it. Cla&s;&s;ical quotation is the <HI>parole</HI> of literary men all over the world."</Q> WILKES. <Q REND="inline">"Upon the continent they all quote the vulgate Bible. Shak&s;peare is chiefly quoted here; and we quote al&s;o Pope, Prior, Butler, Waller, and &s;ometimes Cowley."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of Letter-writing. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It is now become &s;o much the fa&s;hion to publi&s;h letters, that in order to avoid it, I put as little into mine as I can."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Do what you will, Sir, you cannot avoid it. Should you even write as ill as you can, your letters would be publi&s;hed as curio&s;ities.
<Q><L>'Behold a miracle! in&s;tead of wit</L>
<L>'See two dull lines with Stanhope's pencil writ."</L></Q></Q></P>
<P>He gave us an entertaining account of <HI>Bet Flint,</HI> a woman of the town, who, with &s;ome eccentrick talents and much effrontery, forced her&s;elf upon his acquaintance. <Q REND="inline">"Bet (&s;aid he) wrote her own Life in ver&s;e <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>John&s;on, who&s;e memory was wonderfully retentive, remembered the fir&s;t four lines of this curious production, which have been communicated to me by a young lady of his acquaintance:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"When fir&s;t I drew my vital breath,</L>
<L>"A little minikin I came upon earth;</L>
<L>"And then I came from a dark abode,</L>
<L>"Into this gay and gaudy world."</L>
</LG></Q></NOTE>, which &s;he brought to me, wi&s;hing that I would furni&s;h her with a Preface to it (laughing). I u&s;ed to &s;ay of her, that &s;he was generally &s;lut and drunkard&mdash;occa&s;ionally, whore and thief. She had, however, genteel lodgings, a &s;pinnet on which &s;he played, and a boy that walked before her chair. Poor Bet was taken up on a charge of &s;tealing a counterpane, and tried at the Old-Bailey. Chief Ju&s;tice&mdash;, who loved a wench, &s;ummed up favourably, and &s;he was acquitted. After which, Bet &s;aid, with a gay and &s;atisfied air, 'Now that the counterpane is <HI>my own,</HI> I &s;hall make a petticoat of it."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of oratory, Mr. Wilkes de&s;cribed it as accompanied with all the charms of poetical expre&s;&s;ion. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; oratory is the power
<PB N="391" REF="393" MS="y">
of beating down your adver&s;ary's arguments, and putting better in their  place."</Q> WILKES. <Q REND="inline">"But this does not move the pa&s;&s;ions."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"He mu&s;t be a weak man who is to be &s;o moved."</Q> WILKES. (naming a cele|brated orator) <Q REND="inline">"Amid&s;t all the brilliancy of&mdash;'s imagination, and the exuberance of his wit, there is a &s;trange want of <HI>ta&s;te.</HI> It was ob&s;erved of Apelles's Venus, that her fle&s;h &s;eemed as if &s;he had been nouri&s;hed by ro&s;es: his oratory would &s;ometimes make one &s;u&s;pect that he eats potatoes and drinks whi&s;ky."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Wilkes ob&s;erved, how tenacious we are of forms in this country, and gave us an in&s;tance, the vote of the Hou&s;e of Commons for remitting money to pay the army in America <HI>in Portugal pieces,</HI> when, in reality, the remit|tance is made not in Portugal money but in our own &s;pecie. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Is there not a law, Sir, again&s;t exporting the current coin of the realm?"</Q> WILKES. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir: but might not the Hou&s;e of Commons, in ca&s;e of real evident nece&s;&s;ity, order our own current coin to be &s;ent into our own colonies?"</Q>&mdash;Here John&s;on, with that quickne&s;s of recollection which di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him &s;o eminently, gave the <HI>Middle&s;ex Patriot</HI> an admirable retort upon his own ground. <Q REND="inline">"Sure, Sir, <HI>you</HI> don't think a <HI>re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> equal to <HI>the law of the land.</HI>"</Q> WILKES. (at once perceiving the application) <Q REND="inline">"GOD forbid, Sir."</Q>&mdash;To hear what had been treated with &s;uch violence in <Q REND="inline">"The Fal&s;e Alarm,"</Q> now turned into plea&s;ant repartee, was extremely agreeable. John&s;on went on&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Locke ob&s;erves well, that a pro|hibition to export the current coin is impolitick; for when the balance of trade happens to be again&s;t a &s;tate, the current coin <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be exported."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Beauclerk's great library was this &s;ea&s;on &s;old in London by auction. Mr. Wilkes &s;aid, he wondered to find in it &s;uch a numerous collection of &s;ermons, &s;eeming to think it &s;trange that a gentleman of Mr. Beauclerk's character in the gay world, &s;hould have cho&s;en to have many compo&s;itions of that kind. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, you are to con&s;ider, that &s;ermons make a con&s;iderable branch of Engli&s;h literature; &s;o that a library mu&s;t be very imperfect if it has not a numerous collection of &s;ermons <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Wilkes probably did not know that there is in an Engli&s;h &s;ermon the mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive and lively account of that entertaining faculty, for which he him&s;elf is &s;o much admired. It is in Dr. Barrow's fir&s;t volume, and fourteenth &s;ermon, <Q REND="inline">"Again&s;t fooli&s;h Talking and Je&s;ting."</Q> My old acquaintance, the late Corbyn Morris, in his ingenious <Q REND="inline">"E&s;&s;ay on Wit, Humour, and Ridicule,"</Q> calls it <Q REND="inline">"a <HI>profu&s;e</HI> de&s;cription of Wit:"</Q> but I do not &s;ee how it could be curtailed, without leaving out &s;ome good circum&s;tance of di&s;crimination. As it is not generally known, and may perhaps di&s;po&s;e &s;ome to read &s;ermons, from which they may receive real advantage, while looking only for entertainment, I &s;hall here quote it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But fir&s;t (&s;ays the learned preacher) it may be demanded, what the thing we &s;peak of is? Or what this facetiou&s;ne&s;s (or <HI>wit,</HI> as he calls it before,) doth import? To which que&s;tions I might reply, as Democritus did to him that a&s;ked the definition of a man, "Tis that which we all &s;ee and know.' Any one better apprehends what it is by acquaintance, than I can inform him by de&s;cription. It is, indeed, a thing &s;o ver&s;atile and multiform, appearing in &s;o many &s;hapes, &s;o many po&s;tures, &s;o many garbs, &s;o variou&s;ly apprehended by &s;everal eyes and judge|ments, that it &s;eemeth no le&s;s hard to &s;ettle a clear and certain notion thereof, than to make a portrait of Proteus, or to define the figure of the fleeting air. Sometimes it lieth in pat allu&s;ion to a known &s;tory, or in &s;ea&s;onable application of a trivial &s;aying, or in forging an appo&s;ite tale: &s;ometimes it playeth in words and phra&s;es, taking advantage from the ambiguity of their &s;en&s;e, or the affinity of their &s;ound: &s;ometimes it is wrapped in a dre&s;s of humourous expre&s;&s;ion: &s;ometimes it lurketh under an odd &s;imilitude: &s;ometimes it is lodged in a &s;ly que&s;tion, in a &s;mart an&s;wer, in a quirki&s;h rea&s;on, in a &s;hrewd intimation, in cunningly diverting or cleverly retorting an objection: &s;ometimes it is couched in a bold &s;cheme of &s;peech, in a tart irony, in a lu&s;ty hyperbole, in a &s;tartling metaphor, in a plau&s;ible reconciling of contradictions, or in acute non&s;en&s;e: &s;ometimes a &s;cenical repre&s;entation of per&s;ons or things, a counterfeit &s;peech, a mimical look or ge&s;ture, pa&s;&s;eth for it: &s;ometimes an affected &s;implicity, &s;ometimes a pre&s;umptuous bluntne&s;s giveth it being: &s;ometimes it ri&s;eth only from a lucky hitting upon what is &s;trange, &s;ometimes from a crafty wre&s;ting obvious matter to the purpo&s;e. Often it con&s;i&s;teth in one knows not what, and &s;pringeth up one can hardly tell how. Its ways are unaccountable, and inexplicable; being an&s;werable to the numberle&s;s rovings of fancy, and windings of language. It is, in &s;hort, a manner of &s;peaking out of the &s;imple and plain way, (&s;uch as rea&s;on teacheth and proveth things by,) which by a pretty &s;urprizing uncouthne&s;s in conceit or expre&s;&s;ion, doth affect and amu&s;e the fancy, &s;tirring in it &s;ome wonder, and breeding &s;ome delight thereto. It rai&s;eth admiration, as &s;ignifying a nimble &s;agacity of apprehen&s;ion, a &s;pecial felicity of invention, a vivacity of &s;pirit, and reach of wit more than vulgar; it &s;eeming to argue a rare quickne&s;s of parts, that one can fetch in remote conceits applicable; a notable &s;kill, that he can dextrou&s;ly accommodate them to the purpo&s;e before him; together with a lively bri&s;kne&s;s of humour, not apt to damp tho&s;e &s;portful fla&s;hes of imagination. (Whence in Ari&s;totle &s;uch per&s;ons are termed <GAP DESC="foreign">, dexterous men, and <GAP DESC="foreign">, men of facile or ver&s;atile manners, who can ea&s;ily turn them&s;elves to all things, or turn all things to them&s;elves.) It al&s;o procureth delight, by grati|fying curio&s;ity with its rarene&s;s, as &s;emblance of difficulty: (as mon&s;ters, not for their beauty, but their rarity; as juggling tricks, not for their u&s;e, but their ab&s;tru&s;ene&s;s, are beheld with plea&s;ure:) by diverting the mind from its road of &s;erious thoughts; by in&s;tilling gaiety and airine&s;s of &s;pirit; by provoking to &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions of &s;pirit in way of emulation or complai|&s;ance; and by &s;ea&s;oning matters, otherwi&s;e di&s;ta&s;teful or in&s;ipid, with an unu&s;ual and thence grateful tang."</Q></P></NOTE>: and in all

Be&s;ides, Sir, (looking at Mr. Wilkes with a placid but &s;ignificant &s;mile,) a man may collect &s;ermons with intention of making him&s;elf better
<PB N="393" REF="395" MS="y">
by them. I hope Mr. Beauclerk intended, that &s;ome time or other that  &s;hould be the ca&s;e with him."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Wilkes &s;aid to me, loud enough for Dr. John&s;on to hear, <Q REND="inline">"Dr. John&s;on &s;hould make me a pre&s;ent of his 'Lives of the Poets,' as I am a poor patriot who cannot afford to buy them."</Q> John&s;on &s;eemed to take no notice of this hint; but in a little while, he called to Mr. Dilly, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, be &s;o good as to &s;end a &s;et of my Lives to Mr. Wilkes, with my compli|ments."</Q> This was accordingly done; and Mr. Wilkes paid Dr. John&s;on a vi&s;it, was courteou&s;ly received, and &s;ate with him a long time.</P>
<P>The company gradually dropped away. Mr. Dilly him&s;elf was called down &s;tairs upon bu&s;ine&s;s; I left the room for &s;ome time; when I returned, I was &s;truck with ob&s;erving Dr. Samuel John&s;on and John Wilkes, E&s;q. literally <HI>t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te;</HI> for they were reclined upon their chairs, with their heads leaning almo&s;t clo&s;e to each other, and talking earne&s;tly, in a kind of confidential whi&s;per, of the per&s;onal quarrel between George the Second and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. Such a &s;cene of perfectly ea&s;y &s;ociality between two &s;uch opponents in the war of political controver&s;y, as that which I now beheld, would have been an excellent &s;ubject for a picture. It pre&s;ented to my mind the happy days which are foretold in Scripture, when the lion &s;hall lye down with the kid <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">When I mentioned this to the Bi&s;hop of Killaloe, <Q REND="inline">"With the <HI>goat,</HI>"</Q> &s;aid his Lord&s;hip. Such, however, is the engaging politene&s;s and plea&s;antry of Mr. Wilkes, and &s;uch the &s;ocial good humour of the Bi&s;hop, that when they dined together at Mr. Dilly's, where I al&s;o was, they were mutually agreeable.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After this day there was another pretty long interval, during which Dr. John&s;on and I did not meet. When I mentioned it to him with regret, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, let us live double."</Q></P>
<P>About this time it was much the fa&s;hion for &s;everal ladies to have evening a&s;&s;emblies, where the fair &s;ex might participate in conver&s;ation with literary and ingenious men, animated by a de&s;ire to plea&s;e. The&s;e &s;ocieties were de|nominated <HI>Blue-&s;tocking Clubs,</HI> the origin of which title being little known, it may be worth while to relate it. One of the mo&s;t eminent members of tho&s;e &s;ocieties, when they fir&s;t commenced, was Mr. Stillingfleet, who&s;e dre&s;s was remarkably grave, and in particular it was ob&s;erved, that he wore blue-&s;tockings. Such was the excellence of his conver&s;ation, that his ab&s;ence was felt as &s;o great a lo&s;s, that it u&s;ed to be &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"We can do nothing without the <HI>blue-&s;tockings;</HI></Q> and thus by degrees the title was e&s;tabli&s;hed. Mi&s;s Hannah More has admirably de&s;cribed a <HI>Blue-&s;tocking Club,</HI> in her <Q REND="inline">"Bas Bleu,"</Q> a
<PB N="394" REF="396">
 poem in which many of the per&s;ons who were mo&s;t con&s;picuous there are mentioned.</P>
<P>John&s;on was prevailed with to come &s;ometimes into the&s;e circles, and did not think him&s;elf too grave even for the lively Mi&s;s Monckton (now Counte&s;s of Corke) who u&s;ed to have the fine&s;t <HI>bit of blue</HI> at the hou&s;e of her mother, Lady Galway. Her vivacity enchanted the Sage, and they u&s;ed to talk together with all imaginable ea&s;e. A &s;ingular in&s;tance happened one evening, when &s;he in&s;i&s;ted that &s;ome of Sterne's writings were very pathetick. John&s;on bluntly denied it. <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure (&s;aid &s;he) they have affected <HI>me.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why (&s;aid John&s;on, &s;miling, and rolling him&s;elf about) that is, becau&s;e, deare&s;t, you're a dunce."</Q> When &s;he &s;ome time afterwards mentioned this to him, he &s;aid with equal truth and politene&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"Madam, if I had thought &s;o, I cer|tainly &s;hould not have &s;aid it."</Q></P>
<P>Another evening John&s;on's kind indulgence towards me had a pretty difficult trial. I had dined at the Duke of Montro&s;e's, with a very agreeable party, and his Grace, according to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, had circulated the bottle very freely. Lord Graham and I went together to Mi&s;s Monckton's, where I certainly was in extraordinary &s;pirits, and above all fear or awe. In the mid&s;t of a great number of per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank, among&s;t whom I recollect with confu&s;ion, a noble lady of the mo&s;t &s;tately decorum; I placed my&s;elf next to John&s;on, and thinking my&s;elf now fully his match, talked to him in a loud and boi&s;terous manner, de&s;irous to let the company know how I could contend with <HI>Ajax.</HI> I particularly remember pre&s;&s;ing him upon the value of the plea&s;ures of the imagination, and as an illu&s;tration of my argument, a&s;king him, <Q REND="inline">"What, Sir, &s;uppo&s;ing I were to fancy that the (naming the mo&s;t charming Duche&s;s in his Maje&s;ty's dominions) were in love with me, &s;hould I not be very happy?"</Q> My friend with much addre&s;s evaded my interrogatories, and kept me as quiet as po&s;&s;ible; but it may ea&s;ily be conceived how he mu&s;t have felt <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><P>Next day I endeavoured to give what had happened the mo&s;t ingenious turn I could, by the following ver&s;es:</P><Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<P>The lady was generou&s;ly forgiving, returned me an obliging an&s;wer, and I thus obtained an <HI>Act of Oblivion,</HI> and took care never to offend again.</P></NOTE>. When a few days afterwards
<PB N="395" REF="397" MS="y">
<HI>I</HI> waited upon him and made an apology, he behaved with the mo&s;t friendly  gentlene&s;s.</P>
<P>While I remained in London this year, John&s;on and I dined together at &s;everal places. I recollect a placid day at Dr. Butters's, who was now removed from Derby to Lower Gro&s;venor-&s;treet, London; but of his con|ver&s;ation on that and other occa&s;ions during this period, I neglected to keep any regular record, and &s;hall therefore in&s;ert here &s;ome mi&s;cellaneous articles which I find in my John&s;onian notes.</P>
<P>His di&s;orderly habits, when <Q REND="inline">"making provi&s;ion for the day that was pa&s;&s;ing over him,"</Q> appear from the following anecdote, communicated to me by Mr. John Nichols:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"In the year 1763, a young book&s;eller, who was an apprentice to Mr. Whi&s;ton, waited on him with a &s;ub&s;cription to his 'Shak&s;peare;' and ob&s;erving that the Doctor made no entry in any book of the &s;ub&s;criber's name, ventured diffidently to a&s;k, whether he would plea&s;e to have the gentleman's addre&s;s, that it might be properly in&s;erted in the printed li&s;t of &s;ub&s;cribers.&mdash;<HI>'I &s;hall print no Li&s;t of Sub&s;cribers;'</HI> &s;aid John&s;on, with great abruptne&s;s: but almo&s;t immediately recollecting him&s;elf, added, very complacently, 'Sir, I have two very cogent rea&s;ons for not printing any li&s;t of &s;ub&s;cribers&mdash;one, that I have lo&s;t all the names&mdash;the other, that I have &s;pent all the money."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="398" MS="y">
 John&s;on could not brook appearing to be wor&s;ted in argument, even when he had taken the wrong &s;ide, to &s;hew the force and dexterity of his talents. When, therefore, he perceived that his opponent gained ground, he had recour&s;e to &s;ome &s;udden mode of robu&s;t &s;ophi&s;try. Once when I was pre&s;&s;ing upon him with vi&s;ible advantage, he &s;topped me thus:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My dear Bo&s;well, let's have no more of this; you'll make nothing of it. I'd rather have you whi&s;tle a Scotch tune."</Q></P>
<P>Care, however, mu&s;t be taken to di&s;tingui&s;h between John&s;on when he <Q REND="inline">"talked for victory,"</Q> and John&s;on when he had no de&s;ire but to inform and illu&s;trate.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"One of John&s;on's principal talents (&s;ays an eminent friend) was &s;hewn in maintaining the wrong &s;ide of an argument, and in a &s;plendid per|ver&s;ion of the truth.&mdash;If you could contrive to have his fair opinion on a &s;ubject, and without any bias from per&s;onal prejudice, or from a wi&s;h to be victorious in argument, it was wi&s;dom it&s;elf, not only convincing, but overpowering."</Q></P>
<P>He had, however, all his life habituated him&s;elf to con&s;ider conver&s;ation as a trial of intellectual vigour and &s;kill; and to this, I think, we may venture to a&s;cribe that unexampled richne&s;s and brilliancy which appeared in his own. As a proof at once of his eagerne&s;s for colloquial di&s;tinction, and his high notion of this eminent friend, he once addre&s;&s;ed him thus: <Q REND="inline">"&mdash;, we now have been &s;everal hours together; and you have &s;aid but one thing for which I envied you."</Q></P>
<P>He di&s;liked much all &s;peculative de&s;ponding con&s;iderations, which tended to di&s;courage men from diligence and exertion. He was in this like Dr. Shaw, the great traveller, who, Mr. Daines Barrington told me, u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I hate a <HI>cui bono</HI> man."</Q> Upon being a&s;ked by a friend what he &s;hould think of one who was apt to &s;ay, <HI>non e&s;t tanti;</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That he's a &s;tupid fellow, Sir.

<P>He told me, that he was glad that I had, by General Oglethorpe's means, become acquainted with Dr. Shebbeare. Indeed that gentleman, whatever objections were made to him, had knowledge and abilities much above the cla&s;s of ordinary writers, and de&s;erves to be remembered as a re&s;pectable name in literature, were it only for his admirable <Q REND="inline">"Letters on the Engli&s;h Nation,"</Q> under the name of <Q REND="inline">"Batti&s;ta Angeloni, a Je&s;uit."</Q></P>

John&s;on and Shebbeare <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">I recollect a ludicrous paragraph in the news-papers, that the King had pen&s;ioned both a <HI>He</HI>-bear and a <HI>She</HI>-bear.</NOTE>, were frequently named together, as having in  former reigns had no predilection for the family of Hanover. The authour of the celebrated <Q REND="inline">"Heroick Epi&s;tle to Sir William Chambers,"</Q> introduces them in one line, in a li&s;t of tho&s;e who <Q REND="inline">"ta&s;ted the &s;weets of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's reign."</Q> Such was John&s;on's fair ta&s;te of the merit of that &s;atire, that he allowed Dr. Gold&s;mith, as he told me, to read it to him from beginning to end, and did not refu&s;e his prai&s;e to its execution.</P>
<P>Gold&s;mith could &s;ometimes take adventurous liberties with him, and e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed. Beauclerk told me that when Gold&s;mith talked of a project for having a third Theatre in London, &s;olely for the exhibition of new plays, in order to deliver authours from the &s;uppo&s;ed tyranny of managers, John&s;on treated it &s;lightingly; upon which Gold&s;mith &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, aye, this may be nothing to you, who can now &s;helter your&s;elf behind the corner of a pen&s;ion;"</Q> and that John&s;on bore this with good-humour.</P>
<P>John&s;on prai&s;ed the Earl of Carli&s;le's Poems, which his Lord&s;hip had publi&s;hed with his name, as not di&s;daining to be a candidate for literary fame. My friend was of opinion, that when a man of rank appeared in that character, he de&s;erved to have his merit hand&s;omely allowed <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot"><P>Men of rank and fortune however &s;hould be pretty well a&s;&s;ured of having a real claim to the approbation of the publick as writers, before they venture to &s;tand forth. Dryden in his Pre&s;ace to <Q REND="inline">"All for Love,"</Q> thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Men of plea&s;ant conver&s;ation (at lea&s;t e&s;teemed &s;o) and endued with a trifling kind of fancy, perhaps helped out by a &s;mattering of Latin, are ambitious to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the herd of gentlemen, by their poetry:
<Q><L>'Rarus euim ferm&egrave; &s;en&s;us communis ill&acirc;</L>
<L>'Fortun&acirc;.&mdash;</L></Q>
And is not this a wretched affectation, not to be contented with what fortune has done for them, and &s;it down quietly with their e&s;tates, but they mu&s;t call their wits in que&s;tion, and needle&s;ly expo&s;e their nakedne&s;s to publick view? Not con&s;idering that they are not to expect the &s;ame approbation from &s;ober men, which they have found from their flatterers after the third bottle: If a little glittering in di&s;cour&s;e has pa&s;&s;ed them on us for witty men, where was the nece&s;&s;ity of undeceiving the world? Would a man who has an ill title to an e&s;tate, but yet is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, would he bring it of his own accord to be tried at We&s;tmin&s;ter? We who write, if we want the talents, yet have the excu&s;e that we do it for a poor &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; but what can be urged in their defence, who not having the vocation of poverty to &s;cribble, out of mere wantonne&s;s take pains to make them&s;elves ridiculous? Horace was certainly in the right where he &s;aid, 'That no man is &s;atisfied with his own condition.'

 think he was more liberal than Mr. William Whitehead, in his <Q REND="inline">"Elegy to Lord Villiers,"</Q> in which under the pretext of <Q REND="inline">"&s;uperiour toils, demanding all their care,"</Q> he di&s;covers a jealou&s;y of the great paying their court to the Mu&s;es.</P>

Dr. Barnard made it the &s;ubject of a copy of plea&s;ant ver&s;es, in which he &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf to learn different perfections from different men. They concluded with delicate irony:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"John&s;on &s;hall teach me how to place,</L>
<L>"In faire&s;t light each borrow'd grace;</L>
<L>"From him I'll learn to write:</L>

<L>"And by the roughne&s;s of his file,</L>
<L>"Grow&mdash;like <HI>him&s;elf&mdash;polite."</HI></L>
</LG></Q>
<P>I know not if John&s;on ever &s;aw the Poem, but I had occa&s;ion to find that as Dr. Barnard and he knew each other better, their mutual regard increa&s;ed.</P></NOTE>; and I have neglected him, not wilfully, but from being otherwi&s;e occupied. Always, Sir, &s;et a high value on &s;pontaneous kindne&s;s. He, who&s;e inclination prompts him to cultivate your friend&s;hip of his own accord, will love you more than one whom you have been at pains to attach to you."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on told me, that he was once much plea&s;ed to find that a carpenter, who lived near him, was very ready to &s;hew him &s;ome things in his bu&s;ine&s;s which he wi&s;hed to &s;ee. <Q REND="inline">"It was paying (&s;aid he) re&s;pect to literature."</Q></P>
<P>I a&s;ked him if he was not di&s;&s;atisfied with having &s;o &s;mall a &s;hare of wealth, and none of tho&s;e di&s;tinctions in the &s;tate which are the objects of ambition. He had only a pen&s;ion of three hundred a year. Why was he not in &s;uch circum&s;tances as to keep his coach? Why had he not &s;ome con|&s;iderable office? JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I have never complained of the world;
<PB N="399" REF="401" MS="y">
nor do I think that I have rea&s;on to complain. It is rather to be wondered  at that I have &s;o much. My pen&s;ion is more out of the u&s;ual cour&s;e of things than any in&s;tance that I have known. Here, Sir, was a man avowedly no friend to the Government at the time, gets a pen&s;ion without a&s;king for it. I never courted the great; they &s;ent for me: but I think they now give me up. They are &s;atisfied. They have &s;een enough of me."</Q> Upon my ob&s;erving that I could not believe this, for they mu&s;t certainly be highly plea&s;ed by his conver&s;ation; con&s;cious of his own &s;uperiority, he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; great Lords and great Ladies don't love to have their mouths &s;topped."</Q> This was very expre&s;&s;ive of the effect which the force of his under&s;tanding and brilliancy of his fancy could not but produce; and, to be &s;ure, they mu&s;t have found them&s;elves &s;trangely dimini&s;hed in his company. When I warmly declared how happy I was at all times to hear him;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir (&s;aid he). But if you were Lord Chancellor, it would not be &s;o: you would then con&s;ider your own dignity."</Q></P>
<P>There was much truth and knowledge of human nature in this remark. But certainly one &s;hould think, that in whatever elevated &s;tate of life a man who <HI>knew</HI> the value of the conver&s;ation of John&s;on might be placed, though he might prudently avoid a &s;ituation in which he might appear le&s;&s;ened by compari&s;on; yet he would frequently gratify him&s;elf in private with the participation of the rich intellectual entertainment which John&s;on could furni&s;h. Strange, however, it is, to con&s;ider how few of the great &s;ought his &s;ociety; &s;o that if one were di&s;po&s;ed to take occa&s;ion for &s;atire on that account, very con&s;picuous objects pre&s;ent them&s;elves. His noble friend, Lord Elibank, well ob&s;erved, that if a great man procured an interview with John&s;on, and did not wi&s;h to &s;ee him more, it &s;hewed a mere idle curio&s;ity, and a wretched want of reli&s;h for extraordinary powers of mind. Mrs. Thrale ju&s;tly and wittily accounted for &s;uch conduct by &s;aying, that John&s;on's conver&s;ation was by much too &s;trong for a per&s;on accu&s;tomed to ob&s;equiou&s;|ne&s;s and flattery; it was <HI>mu&s;tard in a young child's mouth!</HI></P>
<P>One day, when I told him that I was a zealous Tory, but not enough <Q REND="inline">"according to knowledge,"</Q> and &s;hould be obliged to him for <Q REND="inline">"a rea&s;on,"</Q> he was &s;o candid, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o well, that I begged of him to repeat what he had &s;aid, and I wrote down as follows:</P>

<P>A wi&s;e Tory and a wi&s;e Whig, I believe, will agree. Their principles are the &s;ame, though their modes of thinking are different. A high Tory

 makes Government unintelligible: it is lo&s;t in the clouds. A violent Whig makes it impracticable: he is for allowing &s;o much liberty to every man, that there is not power enough to govern any man. The prejudice of the Tory is for e&s;tabli&s;hment: the prejudice of the Whig is for innovation. A Tory does not wi&s;h to give more real power to Government; but that Govern|ment &s;hould have more reverence. Then they differ as to the Church.

<P>On Saturday, June 2, I &s;et out for Scotland, and had engaged, as I &s;ome|times did, to pay a vi&s;it, in my way, at Southill, in Bedford&s;hire, at the ho&s;pitable man&s;ion of 'Squire Dilly, the elder brother of my worthy friends the book&s;ellers in the Poultry. Dr. John&s;on agreed to be of the party this year, with Mr. Charles Dilly and me, and to go and &s;ee Lord Bute's &s;eat at Luton Hoe. He talked little to us in the carriage, being chiefly occupied in reading Dr. Wat&s;on's &s;econd volume of <Q REND="inline">"Chemical E&s;&s;ays,"</Q> which he liked very well, and his own <Q REND="inline">"Prince of Aby&s;&s;inia,"</Q> on which he &s;eemed to be inten&s;ely fixed; having told us, that he had not looked at it &s;ince it was fir&s;t publi&s;hed. I happened to take it out of my pocket to-day, and he &s;eized upon it with avidity. He pointed out to me the following remarkable pa&s;&s;age: <Q REND="inline">"By what means (&s;aid the Prince) are the Europeans thus powerful; or why, &s;ince they can &s;o ea&s;ily vi&s;it A&s;ia and Africa for trade or conque&s;t, cannot the A&s;iaticks and Africans invade their coa&s;ts, plant colonies in their ports, and give laws to their natural princes? The &s;ame wind that carries them back would bring us hither."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"They are more powerful, Sir, than we, (an&s;wered Imlac,) becau&s;e they are wi&s;er. Knowledge will always predominate over ignorance, as man governs the other animals. But why their knowledge is more than ours, I know not what rea&s;on can be given, but the un&s;earchable will of the Supreme Being."</Q> He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"This, Sir, no man can explain otherwi&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>We &s;topped at Welwyn, where I wi&s;hed much to &s;ee, in company with Dr. John&s;on, the re&s;idence of the authour of <Q REND="inline">"Night Thoughts,"</Q> which was then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his &s;on, Mr. Young. Here &s;ome addre&s;s was requi&s;ite, for I was not acquainted with Mr. Young, and had I propo&s;ed to Dr. John&s;on that we &s;hould &s;end to him, he would have checked my wi&s;h, and perhaps been offended. I therefore concerted with Mr. Dilly, that I &s;hould &s;teal away from Dr. John&s;on and him, and try what reception I could procure from
<PB N="401" REF="403" MS="y">
Mr. Young; if unfavourable nothing was to be &s;aid; but if agreeable I &s;hould  return and notify it to them. I ha&s;tened to Mr. Young's, found he was at home, &s;ent in word that a gentleman de&s;ired to wait upon him, and was &s;hewn into a parlour, where he and a young lady, his daughter, were &s;itting. He appeared to be a plain, civil, country gentleman; and when I begged pardon for pre&s;uming to trouble him, but &s;aid I wi&s;hed much to &s;ee his place, if he would give me leave; he behaved very courteou&s;ly, and an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"By all means, Sir; we are ju&s;t going to drink tea; will you &s;it down?"</Q> I thanked him, but &s;aid, that Dr. John&s;on had come with me from London, and I mu&s;t return to the inn and drink tea with him; that my name was Bo&s;well, I had travelled with him in the Hebrides. <Q REND="inline">"Sir (&s;aid he) I &s;hould think it a great honour to &s;ee Dr. John&s;on here. Will you allow me to &s;end for him?"</Q> Availing my&s;elf of this opening, I &s;aid that <Q REND="inline">"I would go my&s;elf and bring him, when he had drunk tea; he knew nothing of my calling here."</Q> Having been thus &s;ucce&s;sful, I ha&s;tened back to the inn, and informed Dr. John&s;on that <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Young, &s;on of Dr. Young, the authour of 'Night Thoughts,' whom I had ju&s;t left, de&s;ired to have the honour of &s;eeing him at the hou&s;e where his father lived."</Q> Dr. John&s;on luckily made no inquiry how this invitation had ari&s;en, but agreed to go, and when we entered Mr. Young's parlour, he addre&s;&s;ed him with a very polite bow, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I had a curio&s;ity to come and &s;ee this place. I had the honour to know that great man, your father."</Q> We went into the garden, where we found a gravel walk, on each &s;ide of which was a row of trees, planted by Dr. Young, which formed a hand&s;ome Gothick arch; Dr. John&s;on called it a fine grove. I beheld it with reverence.</P>
<P>We &s;at &s;ome time in the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, on the out&s;ide wall of which was in&s;cribed, <Q REND="inline">"Ambulantes in horto audiebant vocem Dei."</Q> And in reference to a brook by which it is &s;ituated, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Vivendi rect&egrave; qui prorogat horam,</HI> &amp;c."</Q> I &s;aid to Mr. Young, that I had been told his father was cheerful. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) he was too well-bred a man not to be cheerful in company; but he was gloomy when alone. He never was cheerful after my mother's death, and he had met with many di&s;appointments."</Q> Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved to me afterwards, <Q REND="inline">"That this was no favourable account of Dr. Young; for it is not becoming in a man to have &s;o little acquie&s;cence in the ways of Providence, as to be gloomy becau&s;e he has not obtained as much preferment as he expected; nor to continue gloomy for the lo&s;s of his wife. Grief has its time."</Q> The la&s;t part of this cen&s;ure was theoretically made. Practically, we know that grief for the lo&s;s of a wi&s;e may be continued very long, in
<PB N="402" REF="404" MS="y">
 proportion as affection has been &s;incere. No man knew this better than Dr. John&s;on.</P>
<P>We went into the church, and looked at the monument erected by Mr. Young, to his father. Mr. Young mentioned an anecdote, that his father had received &s;everal thou&s;and pounds of &s;ub&s;cription-money for his <Q REND="inline">"Univer&s;al Pa&s;&s;ion,"</Q> but had lo&s;t it in the South-Sea. Dr. John&s;on thought this mu&s;t be a mi&s;take; for he had never &s;een a &s;ub&s;cription-book.</P>
<P>Upon the road we talked of the uncertainty of profit with which authours and book&s;ellers engage in the publication of literary works. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"My judgement I have found is no certain rule as to the &s;ale of a book."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, have you been much plagued with authours &s;ending you their works to revi&s;e?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; I have been thought a &s;our &s;urly fellow."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Very lucky for you, Sir&mdash;in that re&s;pect."</Q> I mu&s;t however ob&s;erve, that notwith&s;tanding what he now &s;aid, which he no doubt imagined at the time to be the fact, there was, perhaps, no man who more frequently yielded to the &s;olicitations even of very ob&s;cure authours, to read their manu&s;cripts, or more liberally a&s;&s;i&s;ted them with advice and correction.</P>
<P>He found him&s;elf very happy at Mr. Dilly's, where there is always abun|dance of excellent fare and hearty welcome.</P>
<P>On Sunday, June 3, we all went to Southill church, which is very near to Mr. Dilly's hou&s;e. It being the fir&s;t Sunday of the month, the holy &s;acrament was admini&s;tered, and I &s;taid to partake of it. When I came afterwards into Dr. John&s;on's room, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You did right to &s;tay and receive the communion; I had not thought of it."</Q> This &s;eemed to imply that he did not choo&s;e to approach the altar without a previous preparation, as to which good men entertain different opinions, &s;ome holding that it is irreverent to partake of that ordinance without con&s;iderable premeditation; others, that whoever is a &s;incere Chri&s;tian, and in a proper frame to di&s;charge any other ritual duty of our religion, may, without &s;cruple, di&s;charge this mo&s;t &s;olemn one. A middle notion I believe to be the ju&s;t one, which is, that communicants need not think a long train of preparatory forms indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary; but neither &s;hould they ra&s;hly and lightly venture upon &s;o aweful and my&s;terious an in&s;titution. Chri&s;tians mu&s;t judge each for him&s;elf, what degree of retirement and &s;elf-examination is nece&s;&s;ary upon each occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Being in a frame, which, I hope for the felicity of human nature, many experience&mdash;in fine weather&mdash;at the country-hou&s;e of a friend&mdash;con&s;oled and elevated by pious exerci&s;es&mdash;I expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf with an unre&s;trained &s;ervour to my <Q REND="inline">"Guide, Philo&s;opher, and Friend;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir, I would fain be a good man; and I am very good now. I fear GOD, and honour the King, I wi&s;h
<PB N="403" REF="405" MS="y">
to do no ill, and to be benevolent to all mankind."</Q> He looked at me with a  benignant indulgence; but took occa&s;ion to give me able and &s;alutary caution. <Q REND="inline">"Do not, Sir, accu&s;tom your&s;elf to tru&s;t to <HI>impre&s;&s;ions.</HI> There is a middle &s;tate of mind between conviction and hypocri&s;y, of which many are con&s;cious. By tru&s;ting to impre&s;&s;ions, a man may gradually come to yield to them, and at length be &s;ubject to them, &s;o as not to be a free agent, or what is the &s;ame thing in effect, to <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> that he is not a free agent. A man who is in that &s;tate, &s;hould not be &s;uffered to live; if he declares he cannot help acting in a particular way, but is irre&s;i&s;tibly impelled, there can be no confidence in him, no more than in a tyger. But, Sir, no man believes him&s;elf to be impelled irre&s;i&s;tibly; we know that he who &s;ays he believes it, lies. Fa|vourable impre&s;&s;ions at particular moments, as to the &s;tate of our &s;ouls, may be deceitful and dangerous. In general no man can be &s;ure of his acceptance with GOD; &s;ome, indeed, may have had it revealed to them. St. Paul, who wrought miracles, may have had a miracle wrought on him&s;elf, and may have obtained &s;upernatural a&s;&s;urance of pardon, and mercy, and beatitude; yet St. Paul, though he expre&s;&s;es &s;trong hope, al&s;o expre&s;&s;es fear, le&s;t having preached to others, he him&s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t-away."</Q></P>
<P>The opinion of a learned Bi&s;hop of our acquaintance, as to there being merit in religious faith, being mentioned. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, yes, Sir, the mo&s;t licentious man, were hell open before him, would not take the mo&s;t beautiful &s;trumpet to his arms. We mu&s;t, as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, live by faith, not by &s;ight."</Q></P>
<P>I talked to him of original &s;in <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Dr. Ogden, in his &s;econd &s;ermon <Q REND="inline">"On the Articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith,"</Q> with admirable acutene&s;s thus addre&s;&s;es the oppo&s;ers of that doctrine, which accounts for the confu&s;ion, &s;in, and mi&s;ery, which we find in this life: <Q REND="inline">"It would be &s;evere in GOD, you think, to <HI>degrade</HI> us to &s;uch a &s;ad &s;tate as this, for the offence of our fir&s;t parents; but you can allow him to <HI>place</HI> us in it, without any inducement. Are our calamities le&s;&s;ened for not being a&s;cribed to Adam? If your condition be unhappy, is it not &s;till unhappy, whatever was the occa&s;ion? With the aggravation of this reflection, that if it was as good as it was at fir&s;t de&s;igned, there &s;eems to be &s;omewhat the le&s;s rea&s;on to look for its amendment."</Q></NOTE>, in con&s;equence of the fall of man, and of the atonement made by our SAVIOUR. After &s;ome conver&s;ation, which he de&s;ired me to remember, he at my reque&s;t dictated to me as follows:</P>
<Q><P>WITH re&s;pect to original &s;in, the inquiry is not nece&s;&s;ary; for whatever is the cau&s;e of human corruption, men are evidently and confe&s;&s;edly &s;o cor|rupt, that all the laws of heaven and earth, are in&s;ufficient to re&s;train them from crimes.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="406" MS="y">
 Whatever difficulty there may be in the conception of vicarious puni&s;h|ments, it is an opinion which has had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mankind in all ages. There is no nation that has not u&s;ed the practice of &s;acrifices. Whoever, therefore, denies the propriety of vicarious puni&s;hments, holds an opinion which the &s;entiments and practice of mankind have contradicted, from the beginning of the world. The great &s;acrifice for the &s;ins of mankind was offered at the death of the MESSIAH, who is called in &s;cripture, <Q REND="inline">'The Lamb of GOD, that taketh away the &s;ins of the world.'</Q> To judge of the rea&s;on|ablene&s;s of the &s;cheme of redemption, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as nece&s;&s;ary to the government of the univer&s;e, that GOD &s;hould make known his perpetual and irreconcileable dete&s;tation of moral evil. He might indeed puni&s;h, and puni&s;h only the offenders: but as the end of puni&s;hment is not revenge of crimes, but propagation of virtue, it was more becoming the Divine clemency to find another manner of proceeding, le&s;s de&s;tructive to man, and at lea&s;t equally powerful to promote goodne&s;s. The end of puni&s;hment is to reclaim and warn. <HI>That</HI> puni&s;hment will both reclaim and warn, which &s;hews evidently &s;uch abhorrence of &s;in in GOD, as may deter us from it, or &s;trike us with dread of vengeance when we have committed it. This is effected by vicarious puni&s;hment. Nothing could more te&s;tify the oppo&s;ition between the nature of GOD and moral evil, or more amply di&s;play his ju&s;tice, to men and angels, to all orders and &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of beings, than that it was nece&s;&s;ary for the highe&s;t and pure&s;t nature, even for DIVINITY it&s;elf, to pacify the demands of vengeance, by a painful death; of which the natural effect will be, that when ju&s;tice is appea&s;ed, there is a proper place for the exerci&s;e of mercy; and that &s;uch propitiation &s;hall &s;upply, in &s;ome degree, the imperfections of our obedience, and the inefficacy of our repentance. For, obedience and repentance, &s;uch as we can perform, are &s;till nece&s;&s;ary. Our SAVIOUR has told us, that he did not come to de&s;troy the law, but to fulfil: to fulfil the typical law, by the performance of what tho&s;e types had fore&s;hewn; and the moral law, by precepts of greater purity and higher exaltation.</P></Q>
<P>[Here he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"GOD ble&s;s you with it."</Q> I acknowledged my&s;elf much obliged to him; but I begged that he would go on as to the propitiation being the chief object of our mo&s;t holy faith. He then dictated this one other paragraph.]</P>
<P><Q>The peculiar doctrine of Chri&s;tianity is, that of an univer&s;al &s;acrifice, and perpetual propitiation. Other prophets only proclaimed the will and the threatenings of GOD. CHRIST &s;atisfied his ju&s;tice.</Q></P>

The Reverend Mr. Palmer, Fellow of Queen's-College, Cambridge, dined  with us. He expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h that a better provi&s;ion were made for pari&s;h-clerks. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; a pari&s;h-clerk &s;hould be a man who is able to make a will, or write a letter for any body in the pari&s;h."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned Lord Monboddo's notion that the ancient Egyptians, with all their learning, and all their arts, were not only black, but woolly-haired. Mr. Palmer a&s;ked how did it appear upon examining the mummies? Dr. John&s;on approved of this te&s;t.</P>
<P>Although upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions I never heard a more &s;trenuous advocate for the advantages of wealth, than Dr. John&s;on; he this day, I know not from what caprice, took the other &s;ide. <Q REND="inline">"I have not ob&s;erved (&s;aid he) that men of very large fortunes enjoy any thing extraordinary that makes happine&s;s. What has the Duke of Bedford? What has the Duke of Devon&s;hire? The only great in&s;tance that I have ever known of the enjoyment of wealth was, that of Jamaica Dawkins, who going to vi&s;it Palmyra, and hearing that the way was infe&s;ted by robbers, hired a troop of Turki&s;h hor&s;e to guard him."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Gibbons, the Di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, being mentioned, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I took to Dr. Gibbons."</Q> And addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mr. Charles Dilly, added, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee him.

<P>The Reverend Mr. Smith, Vicar of Southill, a very re&s;pectable man, with a very agreeable family, &s;ent an invitation to us to drink tea. I remarked Dr. John&s;on's very formal politene&s;s. Though always fond of changing the &s;cene, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"We mu&s;t have Mr. Dilly's leave. We cannot go from your hou&s;e, Sir, without your permi&s;&s;ion."</Q> We all went, and were well &s;atisfied with our vi&s;it. I however remember nothing particular, except a nice di&s;tinction which Dr. John&s;on made with re&s;pect to the power of memory, maintaining that forgetfulne&s;s was a man's own fault. <Q REND="inline">"To remember and to recollect (&s;aid he) are different things. A man has not the power to recollect what is not in his mind; but when a thing is in his mind he may remember it."</Q> The remark was occa&s;ioned by my leaning back on a chair, which a little before I had perceived to be broken, and pleading forgetfulne&s;s as an excu&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) its being broken was certainly in your mind."</Q></P>
<P>When I ob&s;erved that a hou&s;ebreaker was in general very timorous. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No wonder, Sir; he is afraid of being &s;hot getting <HI>into</HI> a hou&s;e, or hanged when he has got <HI>out</HI> of it."</Q></P>
<P>He told us, that he had in one day written &s;ix &s;heets of a tran&s;lation from the French; adding, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee it now. I wi&s;h that I

 had copies of all the pamphlets written again&s;t me, as it is &s;aid Pope had. Had I known that I &s;hould make &s;o much noi&s;e in the world, I &s;hould have been at pains to collect them. I believe there is hardly a day in which there is not &s;omething about me in the news-papers."</Q></P>
<P>On Monday, June 4, we all went to Luton-Hoe, to &s;ee Lord Bute's mag|nificent &s;eat, for which I had obtained a ticket. As we entered the park, I talked in a high &s;tyle of my old friend&s;hip with Lord Mount&s;tuart, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall probably be much at this place."</Q> The Sage, aware of human vici&s;&s;itudes, gently checked me: <Q REND="inline">"Don't you be too &s;ure of that."</Q> He made two or three peculiar ob&s;ervations; as when &s;hewn the botanical garden, <Q REND="inline">"Is not <HI>every</HI> garden a botanical garden?"</Q> When told that there was a &s;hrubbery to the extent of &s;everal miles; <Q REND="inline">"That is making a very fooli&s;h u&s;e of the ground; a little of it is very well."</Q> When it was propo&s;ed that we &s;hould walk on the plea&s;ure-ground; <Q REND="inline">"Don't let us fatigue our&s;elves. Why &s;hould we walk there? Here's a fine tree, let's get to the top of it."</Q> But upon the whole, he was very much plea&s;ed. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"This is one of the places I do not regret having come to &s;ee. It is a very &s;tately place, indeed; in the hou&s;e magnificence is not &s;acrificed to convenience, nor con|venience to magnificence. The library is very &s;plendid; the dignity of the rooms is very great; and the quantity of pictures is beyond expectation, beyond hope.</Q></P>
<P>It happened without any previous concert, that we vi&s;ited the &s;eat of Lord Bute upon the King's birth-day; we dined and drank his Maje&s;ty's health at an inn, in the village of Luton.</P>
<P>In the evening I put him in mind of his promi&s;e to favour me with a copy of his celebrated Letter to the Earl of Che&s;terfield <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">See page 141 of Vol. I.</NOTE>, and he was at la&s;t plea&s;ed to comply with this earne&s;t reque&s;t, by dictating it to me from his memory; for he believed that he him&s;elf had no copy. There was an animated glow in his countenance while he thus recalled his high-minded indignation.</P>
<P>He laughed heartily at a ludicrous action in the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, in which I was Coun&s;el. The Society of <HI>Procurators,</HI> or Attornies, entitled to practi&s;e in the inferiour Courts at Edinburgh, had obtained a royal charter, in which they had taken care to have their ancient de&s;ignation of <HI>Procurators,</HI> changed into that of <HI>Solicitors,</HI> from a notion, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, that it was more <HI>genteel;</HI> and this new title they di&s;played by a publick adverti&s;ement for a <HI>General Meeting</HI> at their HALL.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="409">
It has been &s;aid, that the Scotti&s;h nation is not di&s;tingui&s;hed for humour;  and, indeed, what happened on this occa&s;ion may in &s;ome degree ju&s;tify the remark: for although this &s;ociety had contrived to make them&s;elves a very prominent object for the ridicule of &s;uch as might &s;toop to it, the only joke that appeared was the following paragraph, &s;ent as a card to the news-paper called <Q REND="inline">"The Caledonian Mercury:"</Q></P>
<Q><P>A corre&s;pondent informs us, that the Wor&s;hipful Society of <HI>Chaldeans, Cadies,</HI> or <HI>Running Stationers</HI> of this city, are re&s;olved, in imitation, and encouraged by the &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;s of their brethren, of an <HI>equally re&s;pectable</HI> Society, to apply for a Charter of their Privileges, particularly of the &s;ole privilege of PROCURING, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e of the word, exclu&s;ive of chairmen, porters, penny-po&s;t men, and other <HI>inferiour</HI> ranks; their bretheren the R&mdash;Y&mdash;L S&mdash;LL&mdash;RS, <HI>alias</HI> P&mdash;C&mdash;RS, <HI>before the</HI> INFERIOUR Courts of this City, always excepted.</P>
<P>Should the Wor&s;hipful Society be &s;ucce&s;sful, they are farther re&s;olved not to be <HI>puffed up</HI> thereby, but to demean them&s;elves with more equanimity and decency than their <HI>R-y-l, learned,</HI> and <HI>very mode&s;t</HI> brethren above men|tioned have done, upon their late dignification and exaltation.</P></Q>
<P>A majority of the members of the Society pro&s;ecuted Mr. Robert&s;on, the publi&s;her of the paper, for damages; and the fir&s;t judgement of the whole Court very wi&s;ely di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the action, <HI>Solventur ri&s;u tabulae, tu mi&s;&s;us abibis.</HI> But a new trial or review was granted upon a petition, according to the forms in Scotland. This petition I was engaged to an&s;wer, and Dr. John&s;on, with great alacrity furni&s;hed to-night what follows:</P>
<Q><P>All injury is either of the per&s;on, the fortune, or the fame. Now, it is a certain thing, it is proverbially known, that <HI>a je&s;t breaks no bones.</HI> They never have gained half-a-crown le&s;s in the whole profe&s;&s;ion &s;ince this mi&s;|chievous paragraph has appeared: and, as to their reputation, What is their reputation but an in&s;trument of getting money? If, therefore, they have lo&s;t no money, the que&s;tion upon reputation may be an&s;wered by a very old po&s;ition, <HI>De minimis non curat Praetor.</HI></P>
<P>Whether there was, or was not, an <HI>animus injuriandi,</HI> is not worth inquiring, if no <HI>injuria</HI> can be proved. But the truth is, there was no <HI>animus injuriandi.</HI> It was only an <HI>animus irritandi</HI> <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mr. Robert&s;on altered this word to <HI>jocandi,</HI> he having found in Black&s;tone that to <HI>irritate</HI> is actionable.</NOTE>, which, happening to be exerci&s;ed upon a <HI>genus irritable,</HI> produced unexpected violence of re&s;entment. Their
<PB N="404" REF="410">
 irritability aro&s;e only from an opinion of their own importance, and their delight in their new exaltation. What might have been borne by a <HI>Procurator</HI> could not be borne by a <HI>Solicitor.</HI> Your Lord&s;hips well know, that <HI>honores mutant mores.</HI> Titles and dignities play &s;trongly upon the fancy. As a mad-man is apt to think him&s;elf grown &s;uddenly great; &s;o he that grows &s;uddenly great is apt to borrow a little from the mad-man. To co-operate with their re&s;entment would be to promote their phrenzy; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s to what they might proceed, if to the new title of Solicitor, &s;hould be added the elation of victory and triumph.</P>
<P>We con&s;ider your Lord&s;hips as the protectors of our rights, and the guardians of our virtues; but believe it not included in your high office, that you &s;hould flatter our vices, or &s;olace our vanity: and, as vanity only dictates this pro&s;ecution, it is humbly hoped your Lord&s;hips will di&s;mi&s;s it.</P>
<P>If every attempt, however light or ludicrous, to le&s;&s;en another's reputa|tion, is to be puni&s;hed by a judicial &s;entence, what puni&s;hment can be &s;ufficiently &s;evere for him who attempts to dimini&s;h the reputation of the Supreme Court of Ju&s;tice, by reclaiming upon a cau&s;e already determined, without any change in the &s;tate of the que&s;tion? Does it not imply hopes that the Judges will change their opinion? Is not uncertainty and incon&s;tancy in the highe&s;t degree di&s;reputable to a Court? Does it not &s;uppo&s;e, that the former judgement was temerarious or negligent? Does it not le&s;&s;en the con|fidence of the publick? Will it not be &s;aid, that <HI>jus e&s;t aut incognitum, aut vagum?</HI> and will not the con&s;equence be drawn, <HI>mi&s;era e&s;t &s;ervitus?</HI> Will not the rules of action be ob&s;cure? Will not he who knows him&s;elf wrong to-day, hope that the Courts of Ju&s;tice will think him right to-morrow? Surely, my Lords, the&s;e are attempts of dangerous tendency, which the Solicitors, as men ver&s;ed in the law, &s;hould have fore&s;een and avoided. It was natural for an ignorant printer to appeal from the Lord Ordinary; but from lawyers, the de&s;cendents of lawyers, who have practi&s;ed for three hundred years, and have now rai&s;ed them&s;elves to a higher denomination, it might be expected, that they &s;hould know the reverence due to a judicial determina|tion; and, having been once di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, &s;hould &s;it down in &s;ilence.</P></Q>
<P>I am a&s;hamed to mention, that the Court, by a plurality of voices, with|out having a &s;ingle additional circum&s;tance before them, rever&s;ed their own judgement, made a &s;erious matter of this dull and fooli&s;h joke, and adjudged Mr. Robert&s;on to pay to the Society five pounds (&s;terling money) and co&s;ts of &s;uit. The deci&s;ion will &s;eem &s;trange to Engli&s;h lawyers.</P>

On Tue&s;day, June 5, John&s;on was to return to London. He was very  plea&s;ant at breakfa&s;t; I mentioned a friend of mine having re&s;olved never to marry a pretty woman.

No, Sir, I would prefer a pretty woman, unle&s;s there are objections to her. A pretty woman may be fooli&s;h; a pretty woman may be wicked; a pretty woman may not like me. But there is no &s;uch danger in marrying a pretty woman as is apprehended; &s;he will not be per&s;ecuted if &s;he does not invite per&s;ecution. A pretty woman, if &s;he has a mind to be wicked, can find a readier way than another; and that is all."</Q></P>
<P>I accompanied him in Mr. Dilly's chai&s;e to Shefford, where talking of Lord Bute's never going to Scotland, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"As an Engli&s;hman, I &s;hould wi&s;h all the Scotch gentlemen to be educated in England; Scotland would become a province; they would &s;pend all their rents in England."</Q> This is a &s;ubject of much con&s;equence, and much delicacy. The advantage of an Engli&s;h education is unque&s;tionably very great to Scotch gentlemen of talents and ambition; and regular vi&s;its, and I &s;hould think other means, might be effectually u&s;ed to prevent them from being totally e&s;tranged from their native country, any more than a Cumberland or Northumberland gentleman, who has been educated in the South of England. I own, indeed, that it is no &s;mall misfortune for Scotch gentlemen, who have neither talents nor ambition, to be educated in England, where they may be perhaps di&s;tin|gui&s;hed only by a nick-name, lavi&s;h their fortune in giving expen&s;ive enter|tainments to tho&s;e who laugh at them, and &s;aunter about as mere idle in&s;ignificant hangers on even upon the fooli&s;h great; when if they had been judiciou&s;ly brought up at home, they might have been comfortable and creditable members of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>At Shefford, I had another affectionate parting from my revered friend, who was taken up by the Bedford coach, and carried to the metropolis.

The following curious anecdote I in&s;ert in Dr. Burney's own words. <Q REND="inline">"Dr.  Burney related to Dr. John&s;on the partiality which his writings had excited in a friend of Dr. Burney's, the late Mr. Bewley, well known in Norfolk by the name of the <HI>Philo&s;opher of Ma&s;&s;ingham;</HI> who, from the Ramblers and Plan of his Dictionary, and long before the authour's fame was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Dictionary it&s;elf, or any other work, had conceived &s;uch a reverence for him, that he urgently begged Dr. Burney to give him the cover of the fir&s;t letter he had received from him, as a relick of &s;o e&s;timable a writer. This was in 1755. In 1760, when Dr. Burney vi&s;ited Dr. John&s;on at the Temple in London, where he had then Chambers, he happened to arrive there before he was up; and being &s;hewn into the room where he was to breakfa&s;t, find|ing him&s;elf alone, he examined the contents of the apartment, to try whether he could undi&s;covered &s;teal any thing to &s;end to his friend Bewley, as another relick of the admirable Dr. John&s;on. But finding nothing better to his purpo&s;e, he cut &s;ome bri&s;tles off his hearth-broom, and inclo&s;ed them in a letter to his country enthu&s;ia&s;t, who received them with due reverence. The Doctor was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the honour done him by a man of genius and &s;cience, to whom he was an utter &s;tranger, that he &s;aid to Dr. Burney, 'Sir, there is no man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;malle&s;t portion of mode&s;ty, but mu&s;t be flattered with the admiration of &s;uch a man. I'll give him a &s;et of my Lives, if he will do me the honour to accept of them.' In this he kept his word; and Dr. Burney had not only the plea&s;ure of gratifying his friend with a pre&s;ent more worthy of his acceptance than the &s;egment from the hearth-broom, but &s;oon after of introducing him to Dr. John&s;on him&s;elf in Bolt|court, with whom he had the &s;atisfaction of conver&s;ing a con&s;iderable time, not a fortnight before his death; which happened in St. Martin's-&s;treet, during his vi&s;it to Dr. Burney, in the hou&s;e where the great Sir I&s;aac Newton had lived and died before."</Q></P>

<P>After innumerable re&s;olutions formed and neglected, I have retired hither, to plan a life of greater diligence, in hope that I may yet be u&s;eful, and be daily better prepared to appear before my Creator and my Judge, from who&s;e infinite mercy I humbly call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport.</P>

 How venerably pious does he appear in the&s;e moments of &s;olitude, and how &s;pirited are his re&s;olutions for the improvement of his mind, even in elegant literature at a very advanced period of life, and when afflicted with many complaints.</P>
<P>In autumn he went to Oxford, Birmingham, Lichfield, and A&s;hbourne, for which very good rea&s;ons might be given, in the conjectural yet po&s;itive manner of writers, who are proud to account for every event which they relate. He him&s;elf however &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"The motives of my journey I hardly know; I omitted it la&s;t year, and am not willing to mi&s;s it again <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 201.</NOTE>."</Q> But &s;ome good con&s;iderations ari&s;e, among&s;t which is the kindly recollection of Mr. Hector, &s;urgeon, at Birmingham. <Q REND="inline">"Hector is likewi&s;e an old friend, the only companion of my childhood that pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;chool with me.

<P>At a time when he was le&s;s able than he had once been to &s;u&s;tain a &s;hock, he was &s;uddenly deprived of Mr. Levett, which he thus communicated to Dr. Lawrence:

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR old friend, Mr. Levett, who was la&s;t night eminently cheerful, died this morning. The man who lay in the &s;ame room, hearing an un|common noi&s;e, got up and tried to make him &s;peak, but without effect. He then called Mr. Holder, the apothecary, who though when he came he thought him dead, opened a vein, but could draw no blood.

<P>IT is now long &s;ince we &s;aw one another, and whatever has been the rea&s;on neither you have written to me, nor I to you. To let friend&s;hip die away by negligence and &s;ilence, is certainly not wi&s;e. It is voluntarily to throw away one of the greate&s;t comforts of this weary pilgrimage, of which when it is, as it mu&s;t be, taken finally away, he that travels on alone, will wonder how his e&s;teem could be &s;o little. Do not forget me; you &s;ee that I do not forget you. It is plea&s;ing in the &s;ilence of &s;olitude to think, that there is one at lea&s;t, however di&s;tant, of who&s;e benevolence there is little doubt, and whom there is yet hope of &s;eeing again.</P>
<P>Of my life, from the time we parted, the hi&s;tory is mournful. The &s;pring of la&s;t year deprived me of Thrale, a man who&s;e eye for fifteen years had &s;carcely been turned upon me but with re&s;pect or tenderne&s;s; for &s;uch another friend, the general cour&s;e of human things will not &s;uffer man to hope. I pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ummer at Streatham, but there was no Thrale; and having idled away the &s;ummer with a weakly body and neglected mind, I made a journey to Stafford&s;hire on the edge of winter. The &s;ea&s;on was dreary, I was &s;ickly, and found the friends &s;ickly whom I went to &s;ee. After a &s;orrowful &s;ojourn, I returned to a habitation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for the pre&s;ent by two &s;ick women, where my dear old friend, Mr. Levett, to whom as he u&s;ed to tell me, I owe your acquaintance, died a few weeks ago, &s;uddenly in his bed; there pa&s;&s;ed not, I believe, a minute between health and death. At night, as at Mrs. Thrale's, I was mu&s;ing in my chamber, I thought with uncommon earne&s;tne&s;s, that however I might alter my mode of life, or whither&s;oever I might remove,
<PB N="420" REF="422" MS="y">
 I would endeavour to retain Levett about me; in the morning my &s;ervant brought me word that Levett was called to another &s;tate, a &s;tate for which, I think, he was not unprepared, for he was very u&s;eful to the poor. How much &s;oever I valued him, I now wi&s;h that I had valued him more.</P>

<P>I HOPE I do not very gro&s;ly flatter my&s;elf to imagine that you and dear Mrs. Carele&s;s will be glad to hear &s;ome account of me. I per|formed the journey to London with very little inconvenience, and came &s;afe to my habitation, where I found nothing but ill health, and, of con&s;equence, very little cheerfulne&s;s. I then went to vi&s;it a little way into the country, where I got a complaint by a cold which has hung eight weeks upon me, and from which I am, at the expence of fifty ounces of blood, not yet free. I am afraid I mu&s;t once more owe my recovery to warm weather, which &s;eems to make the advances towards us.</P>
<P>Such is my health, which will, I hope, &s;oon grow better. In other re&s;pects I have no rea&s;on to complain. I know not that I have written any thing more generally commended than the Lives of the Poets; and have found the world willing enough to care&s;s me, if my health had invited me to be in much company: but this &s;ea&s;on I have been almo&s;t wholly employed in nur&s;ing my&s;elf.</P>
<P>When &s;ummer comes I hope to &s;ee you again, and will not put off my vi&s;it to the end of the year. I have lived &s;o long in London, that I did not remember the difference of &s;ea&s;ons.</P>

<P>THAT you and dear Mrs. Carele&s;s &s;hould have care or curio&s;ity about my health, gives me that plea&s;ure which every man feels from finding him&s;elf not forgotten.

You and I &s;hould now naturally cling to one another: we have outlived mo&s;t of tho&s;e who could pretend to rival us in each other's kindne&s;s. In our walk through life we have dropped our companions, and are now to pick up &s;uch as chance may offer us, or to travel on alone. You, indeed, have a &s;i&s;ter, with whom you can divide the day: I have no natural friend left; but Providence has been plea&s;ed to pre&s;erve me from neglect; I have not wanted &s;uch alleviations of life as friend&s;hip could &s;upply.

Let us, however, pray for each other, and hope to &s;ee one another yet from time to time with mutual delight. My di&s;order has been a cold, which impeded the organs of re&s;piration, and kept me many weeks in a &s;tate of great unea&s;ine&s;s, but by repeated phlebotomy it is now relieved; and next to the recovery of Mrs. Bo&s;well, I flatter my&s;elf, that you will rejoice at mine.</P>
<P>What we &s;hall do in the &s;ummer it is yet too early to con&s;ider. You want to know what you &s;hall do now; I do not think this time of bu&s;tle and confu&s;ion likely to produce any advantage to you. Every man has tho&s;e to reward and gratify who have contributed to his advancement. To come hither with &s;uch expectations at the expence of borrowed money, which, I find, you know not where to borrow, can hardly be con&s;idered as prudent. I am &s;orry to find, what your &s;ollicitation &s;eems to imply, that you have already gone the whole length of your credit. This is to &s;et the quiet of your whole life at hazard. If you anticipate your inheritance, you can at la&s;t inherit nothing; all that you receive mu&s;t pay for the pa&s;t. You mu&s;t get a place, or pine in penury, with the empty name of a great e&s;tate. Poverty, my dear friend, is &s;o great an evil, and pregnant with &s;o much temptation, and &s;o much mi&s;ery, that I cannot but earne&s;tly enjoin you to avoid it. Live on what you have, live if you can on le&s;s; do not borrow either for vanity or plea&s;ure; the vanity will end in &s;hame, and the plea&s;ure in regret; &s;tay therefore at home, till you have &s;aved money for your journey hither.</P>
<P>The Beauties of John&s;on' are &s;aid to have got money to the collector; if the 'Deformities' have the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, I &s;hall be &s;till a more exten&s;ive benefactor.</P>
<P>Make my compliments to Mrs. Bo&s;well, who is, I hope, reconciled to me; and to the young people, whom I never have offended.</P>
<P>You never told me the &s;ucce&s;s of your plea again&s;t the Solicitors.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding his afflicted &s;tate of body and mind this year, the fol|lowing corre&s;pondence affords a proof not only of his benevolence and con&s;cientious readine&s;s to relieve a good man from errour, but by his clothing

<P>BEING now in the country in a &s;tate of recovery, as I hope, from a very oppre&s;&s;ive di&s;order, I cannot neglect the acknowledgement of your Chri&s;tian letter. The book called <Q REND="inline">"The Beauties of John&s;on,"</Q> is the production of I know not whom: I never &s;aw it but by ca&s;ual in&s;pection, and con&s;idered my&s;elf as utterly di&s;engaged from its con&s;equences. Of the pa&s;&s;age you mention, I remember &s;ome notice in &s;ome paper; but, knowing that it mu&s;t be mi&s;repre&s;ented, I thought of it no more, nor do I know where to find it in my own books. I am accu&s;tomed to think little of news-papers; but an opinion &s;o weighty and &s;erious as yours has determined me to do, what I &s;hould, without your &s;ea&s;onable admonition, have omitted; and I will direct my thought to be &s;hewn in its true &s;tate <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot"><P>What follows appeared in the Morning Chronicle of May 29, 1782.&mdash;<Q><P>A corre&s;pondent having mentioned, in the Morning Chronicle of December 12, the la&s;t clau&s;e of the following paragraph, as &s;eeming to favour &s;uicide; we are reque&s;ted to print the whole pa&s;&s;age, that its true meaning may appear, which is not to recommend &s;uicide, but exerci&s;e.</P><P>Exerci&s;e cannot &s;ecure us from that di&s;&s;olution to which we are decreed; but while the &s;oul and body continue united, it can make the a&s;&s;ociation plea&s;ing, and give probable hopes that they &s;hall be disjoined by an ea&s;y &s;eparation.

<P>THE earne&s;tne&s;s and tenderne&s;s of your letter is &s;uch, that I can|not think my&s;elf &s;hewing it more re&s;pect than it claims by &s;itting down to an&s;wer it the day on which I received it.</P>
<P>This year has afflicted me with a very irk&s;ome and &s;evere di&s;order. My re&s;piration has been much impeded, and much blood has been taken away. I am now harra&s;&s;ed by a catarrhous cough, from which my purpo&s;e is to &s;eek relief by change of air; and I am, therefore, preparing to go to Oxford.</P>
<P>Whether I did right in di&s;&s;uading you from coming to London this &s;pring, I will not determine. You have not lo&s;t much by mi&s;&s;ing my com|pany; I have &s;carcely been well for a &s;ingle week. I might have received comfort from your kindne&s;s; but you would have &s;een me afflicted, and, perhaps, found me peevi&s;h. Whatever might have been your plea&s;ure or mine, I know not how I could have hone&s;tly advi&s;ed you to come hither with borrowed money. Do not accu&s;tom your&s;elf to con&s;ider debts only as an in|convenience: you will find it a calamity. Poverty takes away &s;o many means of doing good, and produces &s;o much inability to re&s;i&s;t evil, both natural and moral, that it is by all virtuous means to be avoided. Con&s;ider a man who&s;e fortune is very narrow; whatever be his rank by birth, or whatever his reputation by intellectual excellence, what good can he do? or what evil can he prevent? That he cannot help the needy is evident, he has nothing ro &s;pare. But, perhaps, his advice or admonition may be u&s;eful. His poverty will de&s;troy his influence: many more can find that he is poor,
<PB N="425" REF="427">
than that he is wi&s;e; and few will reverence the under&s;tanding that is of &s;o  little advantage to its owner. I &s;ay nothing of the per&s;onal wretchedne&s;s of a debtor, which, however, has pa&s;&s;ed into a proverb. Of riches, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to write the prai&s;e. Let it, however, be remembered, that he who has money to &s;pare, has it always in his power to benefit others; and of &s;uch power a good man mu&s;t always be de&s;irous.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed with your account of Ea&s;ter <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Which I celebrated in the Church-of-England chapel at Edinburgh, founded by Lord Chief Baron Smith, of re&s;pectable and pious memory.</NOTE>.

<P>On the 30th of Augu&s;t, I informed him that my honoured father had died that morning; a complaint under which he had long laboured, having &s;uddenly come to a cri&s;is, while I was upon a vi&s;it at the &s;eat of Sir Charles Pre&s;ton, from whence I had ha&s;tened the day before, upon receiving a letter by expre&s;s.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE &s;truggled through this year with &s;o much infirmity of body, and &s;uch &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions of the fragility of life, that death, wherever it appears, fills me with melancholy; and I cannot hear without emotion, of the removal of any one, whom I have known, into another &s;tate.</P>
<P>Your father's death had every circum&s;tance that could enable you to bear it; it was at a mature age, and it was expected; and as his general life had been pious, his thoughts had doubtle&s;s for many years pa&s;t been turned upon eternity. That you did not find him &s;en&s;ible mu&s;t doubtle&s;s grieve you; his di&s;po&s;ition towards you was undoubtedly that of a kind, though not of a fond father. Kindne&s;s, at lea&s;t actual, is in our power, but fondne&s;s is not; and if by negligence or imprudence you had extingui&s;hed his fondne&s;s, he could not at will rekindle it. Nothing then remained between you but mutual forgivene&s;s of each other's faults, and mutual de&s;ire of each other's happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hall long to know his final di&s;po&s;ition of his fortune.</P>
<P>You, dear Sir, have now a new &s;tation, and have therefore new cares, and new employments. Life, as Cowley &s;eems to &s;ay, ought to re&s;emble a well ordered poem; of which one rule generally received is, that the exordium &s;hould be &s;imple, and &s;hould promi&s;e little. Begin your new cour&s;e of life with the lea&s;t &s;how, and the lea&s;t expence po&s;&s;ible; you may at plea&s;ure encrea&s;e both, but you cannot ea&s;ily dimini&s;h them. Do not think your e&s;tate your own, while any man can call upon you for money which you cannot pay; therefore, begin with timorous par&s;imony. Let it be your fir&s;t care not to be in any man's debt.</P>
<P>When the thoughts are extended to a future &s;tate, the pre&s;ent life &s;eems hardly worthy of all tho&s;e principles of conduct, and maxims of prudence, which one generation of men has tran&s;mitted to another; but upon a clo&s;er view, when it is perceived how much evil is produced, and how much good is impeded by embarra&s;&s;ment and di&s;tre&s;s, and how little room the expedients of poverty leave for the exerci&s;e of virtue; its &s;orrows manife&s;t that the boundle&s;s importance of the next life, enforces &s;ome attention to the intere&s;ts of this.</P>
<P>Be kind to the old &s;ervants, and &s;ecure the kindne&s;s of the agents and factors; do not di&s;gu&s;t them by a&s;perity, or unwelcome gaiety, or apparent &s;u&s;picion. From them you mu&s;t learn the real &s;late of your affairs, the characters of your tenants, and the value of your lands.</P>

<P>HAVING pa&s;&s;ed almo&s;t this whole year in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of di&s;orders, I went in October to Brighthelm&s;ton, whither I came in a &s;tate of &s;o much weakne&s;s, that I re&s;ted four times in walking between the inn and
<PB N="428" REF="430" MS="y">
 the lodging. By phy&s;ick and ab&s;tinence I grew better, and am now rea&s;onably ea&s;y, though at a great di&s;tance from health. I am afraid, however, that health begins, after &s;eventy, and often long before, to have a meaning different from that which it had at thirty. But it is culpable to murmur at the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of the creation, as it is vain to oppo&s;e it. He that lives, mu&s;t grow old; and he that would rather grow old than die, has GOD to thank for the infirmities of old age.</P>
<P>At your long &s;ilence I am rather angry. You do not, &s;ince now you are the head of your hou&s;e, think it worth your while to try whether you or your friend can live longer without writing, nor &s;u&s;pect after &s;o many years of friend&s;hip, that when I do not write to you, I forget you. Put all &s;uch u&s;ele&s;s jealou&s;ies out of your head, and di&s;dain to regulate your own practice by the practice of another, or by any other principle than the de&s;ire of doing right.</P>
<P>Your oeconomy, I &s;uppo&s;e, begins now to be &s;ettled; your expences are adju&s;ted to your revenue, and all your people in their proper places. Re&s;olve not to be poor: whatever you have, &s;pend le&s;s. Poverty is a great enemy to human happine&s;s, it certainly de&s;troys liberty, and it makes &s;ome virtues impracticable, and others extremely difficult.</P>
<P>Let me know the hi&s;tory of your life, &s;ince your acce&s;&s;ion to your e&s;tate. How many hou&s;es, how many cows, how much land in your own hand, and what bargains you make with your tenants.</P>

The death of Mr. Thrale had made a very material alteration upon John&s;on,  with re&s;pect to his reception in that family. The manly authority of the hu&s;band no longer curbed the lively exuberance of the lady; and as her vanity had been fully gratified, by having the Colo&s;&s;us of Literature attached to her for many years, &s;he gradually became le&s;s a&s;&s;iduous to plea&s;e him. Whether her attachment to him was already divided by another object, I am unable to a&s;certain; but it is plain that John&s;on's penetration was alive to her neglect or forced attention; for on the 6th of October this year, we find him making a <Q REND="inline">"parting u&s;e of the library"</Q> at Streatham, and pronouncing a prayer, which he compo&s;ed <Q REND="inline">"On leaving Mr. Thrale's family <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 214.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<Q><P>Almighty GOD, Father of all mercy, help me by thy grace, that I may, with humble and &s;incere thankfulne&s;s, remember the comforts and conveniencies which I have enjoyed at this place; and that I may re&s;ign them with holy &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, equally tru&s;ting in thy protection when Thou give&s;t, and when Thou take&s;t away.

<P>One cannot read this prayer, without &s;ome emotions not very favourable to the lady who&s;e conduct occa&s;ioned it.</P>
<P>In one of his memorandum-books I find, <Q REND="inline">"Sunday, went to church at Streatham. <HI>Templo valedixi cum o&s;culo.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>He met Mr. Philip Metcalfe often at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's, and other places, and was a good deal with him at Brighthelm&s;ton this autumn, being plea&s;ed at once with his excellent table and animated conver&s;ation. Mr. Metcalfe &s;hewed him great re&s;pect, and &s;ent him a note that he might have the u&s;e of his carriage whenever he plea&s;ed. John&s;on (3d October, 1782,) returned this polite an&s;wer:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mr. John&s;on is very much obliged by the kind offer of the carriage; but he has no de&s;ire of u&s;ing Mr. Metcalfe's carriage, except when he can have the plea&s;ure of Mr. Metcalfe's company."</Q> Mr. Metcalfe could not but be highly plea&s;ed that his company was thus valued by John&s;on, and he frequently attended him in airings. They al&s;o went together to Cirence&s;ter, and they vi&s;ited Petworth and Cowdery, the venerable &s;eat of the Lords Montacute. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) I &s;hould like to &s;tay here four-and-twenty hours.

The e&s;teem and kindne&s;s of wi&s;e and good men is one of the la&s;t plea&s;ures which I can be content to lo&s;e; and gratitude to tho&s;e from whom this plea&s;ure is received, is a duty of which I hope never to be reproached with the final neglect. I therefore now return you thanks for the notice which I have received from you; and which I con&s;ider as giving to my name not only more bulk, but more weight; not only as extending its
<PB N="431" REF="433" MS="y">
&s;uperficies, but as increa&s;ing its value. Your book was evidently wanted, and  will, I hope, find its way into the &s;chool, to which, however, I do not mean to confine it; for no man has &s;o much &s;kill in ancient rites and practices as not to want it. As I &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf to owe part of your kindne&s;s to my excellent friend Dr. Patten, he has likewi&s;e a ju&s;t claim to my acknowledge|ments, which I hope you, Sir, will tran&s;mit. There will &s;oon appear a new edition of my Poetical Biography; if you will accept of a copy to keep me in your mind, be plea&s;ed to let me know how it may be conveniently con|veyed to you. The pre&s;ent is &s;mall, but it is given with good will by, Reverend Sir,</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1783"> In 1783 he was more &s;everely afflicted than ever, as will appear in the  cour&s;e of his corre&s;pondence; but &s;till the &s;ame ardour for literature, the &s;ame con&s;tant piety, the &s;ame kindne&s;s for his friends, and the &s;ame vivacity, both in conver&s;ation and writing, di&s;tingui&s;hed him.</P>
<P>Having given Dr. John&s;on a full account of what I was doing at Auchin|leck, and particularly mentioned what I knew would plea&s;e him&mdash;my having brought an old man of eighty-eight from a lonely cottage to a comfortable habitation within my enclo&s;ures, where he had good neighbours near to him, I received an an&s;wer in February, of which I extract what follows:</P>
<Q><P>I am delighted with your account of your activity at Auchinleck, and wi&s;h the old gentleman, whom you have &s;o kindly removed, may live long to promote your pro&s;perity by his prayers. You have now a new character and new duties; think on them, and practi&s;e them.</P>
<P>Make an impartial e&s;timate of your revenue, and whatever it is, live upon le&s;s. Re&s;olve never to be poor. Frugality is not only the ba&s;is of quiet, but of beneficence. No man can help others that wants help him|&s;elf; we mu&s;t have enough before we have to &s;pare.</P>
<P>I am glad to find that Mrs. Bo&s;well grows well; and hope that to keep her well, no care nor caution will be omitted. May you long live happily together.</P>
<P>When you come hither, pray bring with you Baxter's Anacreon. I cannot get that edition in London.</P></Q>
<P>On Friday, March 21, having arrived in London the night before, I was glad to find him at Mrs. Thrale's hou&s;e, in Argyll-&s;treet, appearances of friend&s;hip between them being &s;till kept up. I was &s;hewn into his room, and after the fir&s;t &s;alutation he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am glad you are come. I am very

<MILESTONE N="1783. Aetat. 74."> ill."</Q> He looked pale, and was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with a difficulty of breathing. But he &s;oon a&s;&s;umed his u&s;ual &s;trong animated &s;tyle of conver&s;ation. Seeing me now for the fir&s;t time as a <HI>Laird,</HI> or proprietor of land, he began, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the &s;uperiority of a country-gentleman over the people upon his e&s;tate is very agreeable; and he who &s;ays he does not feel it to be agreeable, lies: for it mu&s;t be agreeable to have a ca&s;ual &s;uperiority over tho&s;e who are by nature equal with us."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Yet, Sir, we &s;ee great proprietors of land who prefer living in London."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, the plea&s;ure of living in London, the intellectual &s;uperiority that is enjoyed there, may counterbalance the other. Be&s;ides, Sir, a man may prefer the &s;tate of the country-gentleman upon the whole, and yet there may never be a moment when he is willing to make the change to quit London for it."</Q> He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It is better to have five <HI>per cent.</HI> out of land than out of money, becau&s;e it is more &s;ecure; but the readine&s;s of transference, and promptne&s;s of intere&s;t, make many people rather choo&s;e the funds. Nay, there is another di&s;advantage belong|ing to land, compared with money. A man is not &s;o much afraid of being a hard creditor as of being a hard landlord."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e there is a &s;ort of kindly connection between a landlord and his tenants."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; many landlords with us never &s;ee their tenants. It is becau&s;e if a landlord drives away his tenants, he may not get others; whereas the demand for money is &s;o great, it may always be lent."</Q></P>
<P>He talked with regret and indignation of the factious oppo&s;ition to Govern|ment at this time, and imputed it, in a great mea&s;ure, to the Revolution. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he, in a low voice, having come nearer to me, while his old prejudices &s;eemed to be fermenting in his mind,) this Hanoverian family is <HI>i&s;ol&eacute;e</HI> here. They have no friends. Now the Stuarts had friends who &s;tuck by them &s;o late as 1745. When the right of the King is not reverenced, there will not be reverence for tho&s;e appointed by the King."</Q></P>
<P>His ob&s;ervation that the pre&s;ent royal family has no friends, has been too much ju&s;tified by the very ungrateful behaviour of many who were under great obligations to his Maje&s;ty; at the &s;ame time there are honourable exceptions; and the very next year after this conver&s;ation, and ever &s;ince, the King has had as exten&s;ive and generous &s;upport as ever was given to any monarch, and has had the &s;atisfaction of knowing that he was more and more endeared to his people.</P>
<P>He repeated to me his ver&s;es on Mr. Levett, with an emotion which gave them full effect; and then he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t be as much
<PB N="433" REF="435" MS="y">
with me as you can. You have done me good. You cannot think how  much better I am &s;ince you came in."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to acquaint Mrs. Thrale that I was arrived. I had not &s;een her &s;ince her hu&s;band's death. She &s;oon appeared, and favoured me with an invitation to &s;tay to dinner, which I accepted. There was no other company but her&s;elf and three of her daughters, Dr. John&s;on, and I. She too, &s;aid &s;he was very glad I was come, for &s;he was going to Bath, and &s;hould have been &s;orry to leave Dr. John&s;on before I came. This &s;eemed to be attentive and kind, and I who had not been informed of any change&punc; imagined all to be as well as formerly. He was little inclined to talk at dinner, and went to &s;leep after it; but when he joined us in the drawing-room, he &s;eemed revived, and was again him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Talking of conver&s;ation, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"There mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t place, be knowledge, there mu&s;t be materials;&mdash;in the &s;econd place, there mu&s;t be a command of words;&mdash;in the third place, there mu&s;t be imagination, to place things in &s;uch views as they are not commonly &s;een in;&mdash;and in the fourth place, there mu&s;t be pre&s;ence of mind, and a re&s;olution that is not to be over|come by failures; this la&s;t is an e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite; for want of it many people do not excel in conver&s;ation. Now <HI>I</HI> want it, I throw up the game upon lo&s;ing a trick."</Q> I wondered to hear him talk thus of him&s;elf, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I don't know, Sir, how this may be, but I am &s;ure you beat other people's cards out of their hands."</Q> I doubt whether he heard this remark. While he went on talking triumphantly, I was fixed in admiration, and &s;aid to Mrs. Thrale, <Q REND="inline">"O, for &s;hort-hand to take this down."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You'll carry it all in your head, (&s;aid &s;he;) a long head is as good as &s;hort-hand."</Q></P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved and wondered at, that Mr. Charles Fox never talked with any freedom in the pre&s;ence of Dr. John&s;on, though it is well known, and I my&s;elf can witne&s;s, that his conver&s;ation is various, fluent, and exceed|ingly agreeable. John&s;on's experience, however, founded him in going on thus: <Q REND="inline">"Fox never talks in private company, not from any determination not to talk, but becau&s;e he has not the fir&s;t motion. A man who is u&s;ed to the applau&s;e of the Hou&s;e of Commons, has no wi&s;h for that of a private company. A man accu&s;tomed to throw for a thou&s;and pounds, if &s;et down to throw for &s;ixpence, would not be at the pains to count his dice. Burke's talk is the ebullition of his mind; he does not talk from a de&s;ire of di&s;tinction, but becau&s;e his mind is full."</Q></P>
<P>He thus curiou&s;ly characteri&s;ed one of our old acquaintance: <Q REND="inline">"******** is a good man, Sir; but he is a vain man, and a liar. He, however, only
<PB N="434" REF="436" MS="y">
 tells lies of vanity; of victories, for in&s;tance, in conver&s;ation which never happened."</Q> This alluded to a &s;tory which I had repeated from that gentleman, to entertain John&s;on with its wild bravado: <Q REND="inline">"This John&s;on, Sir, (&s;aid he,) whom you are all afraid of, will &s;hrink if you come clo&s;e to him in argument, and roar as loud as he. He once maintained the paradox, that there is no beauty but in utility. 'Sir, (&s;aid I,) what &s;ay you to the peacock's tail, which is one of the mo&s;t beautiful objects in nature, but would have as much utility if its feathers were all of one colour.' He <HI>felt</HI> what I thus produced, and had recour&s;e to his u&s;ual expedient, ridicule; exclaiming, 'A peacock has a tail, and a fox has a tail;' and then he bur&s;t out into a laugh. 'Well, Sir, (&s;aid I, with a &s;trong voice, looking him full in the face) you have unkennelled your fox; pur&s;ue him if you dare.' He had not a word to &s;ay, Sir."</Q> John&s;on told me that this was a fiction from beginning to end. <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Were I to in&s;ert all the &s;tories which have been told of conte&s;ts boldly maintained with him, imaginary victories obtained over him, of reducing him to &s;ilence, and of making him own that his antagoni&s;ts had the better of him in argument, my volumes would &s;well to an immoderate &s;ize. One in&s;tance, I find, has circulated both in conver&s;ation and in print; that when he would not allow the Scotch writers to have merit, the late Dr. Ro&s;e, of Chi&s;wick, a&s;&s;erted, that he could name one Scotch writer, who Dr. John&s;on him&s;elf would allow to have written better than any man of the age; and upon John&s;on's a&s;king who it was, an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Lord Bute, when he &s;igned the warrant for your pen&s;ion."</Q> Upon which John&s;on, &s;truck with the repartee, acknowledged that this <HI>was</HI> true. When I mentioned it to John&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) if Ro&s;e &s;aid this, I never heard it."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>After mu&s;ing for &s;ome time, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I wonder how I &s;hould have any enemies; for I do harm to nobody <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">This reflection was very natural in a man of a good heart, who was not con&s;cious of any ill-will to mankind, though the &s;harp &s;ayings which were &s;ometimes produced by his di&s;crimina|tion and vivacity, and which he perhaps did not recollect, were, I am afraid, too often remembered with re&s;entment.</NOTE>."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"In the fir&s;t place, Sir, you will be plea&s;ed to recollect, that you &s;et out with attacking the Scotch; &s;o you got a whole nation for your enemies."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why I own, that by my definition of <HI>oats</HI> I meant to vex them."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, can you trace the cau&s;e of your antipathy to the Scotch."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I can not, Sir."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Old Mr. Sheridan &s;ays, it was becau&s;e they &s;old Charles the Fir&s;t."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, old Mr. Sheridan has found out a very good rea&s;on."</Q></P>
<P>Surely the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and &s;ulky nationality, the mo&s;t determined aver&s;ion to this great and good man, mu&s;t be cured, when he is &s;een thus playing with one of his prejudices, of which he candidly admitted that he
<PB N="435" REF="437" MS="y">
could not tell the rea&s;on. It was, however, probably owing to his having  had in his view the wor&s;t part of the Scotti&s;h nation, the needy adventurers, many of whom he thought were advanced beyond their merits, by means which he did not approve. Had he in his early life been in Scotland, and &s;een the worthy, &s;en&s;ible, independent gentlemen, who live rationally and ho&s;pi|tably at home, he never could have entertained &s;uch unfavourable and unju&s;t notions of his fellow-&s;ubjects. And accordingly we find, that when he did vi&s;it Scotland, in the latter period of his life, he was fully &s;en&s;ible of all that it de&s;erved, as I have already pointed out, when &s;peaking of his <Q REND="inline">"Journey to the We&s;tern I&s;lands."</Q></P>
<P>Next day, Saturday, March 22, I found him &s;till at Mrs. Thrale's, but he told me that he was to go to his own hou&s;e in the afternoon. He was better, but I perceived he was but an unruly patient, for Dr. Pepys, who vi&s;ited him, while I was with him &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If you were <HI>tractable,</HI> Sir, I &s;hould pre&s;cribe for you."</Q></P>
<P>I related to him a remark which a re&s;pectable friend had made to me, upon the then &s;tate of Government, when tho&s;e who had been long in oppo&s;ition had attained to power, it was &s;uppo&s;ed again&s;t the inclination of the Sovereign. <Q REND="inline">"You need not be unea&s;y (&s;aid this gentleman) about the King. He laughs at them all; he plays them one again&s;t another."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Don't think &s;o, Sir. The King is as much oppre&s;&s;ed as a man can be. If he plays them one again&s;t another he <HI>wins</HI> nothing."</Q></P>
<P>I had paid a vi&s;it to General Oglethorpe in the morning, and was told by him that Dr. John&s;on &s;aw company on Saturday evenings, and he would meet me at John&s;on's, that night. When I mentioned this to John&s;on, not doubting that it would plea&s;e him, as he had a great value for Oglethorpe, the &s;retfulne&s;s of his di&s;ea&s;e unexpectedly &s;hewed it&s;elf; his anger &s;uddenly kindled, and he &s;aid, with vehemence, <Q REND="inline">"Did not you tell him not to come? Am I to be <HI>hunted</HI> in this manner?"</Q> I &s;atisfied him that I could not divine that the vi&s;it would not be convenient, and that I certainly could not take it upon me of my own accord, to forbid the General.</P>
<P>I found Dr. John&s;on in the evening in Mrs. Williams's room, at tea and coffee with her and Mrs. De&s;moulins, who were al&s;o both ill; it was a &s;ad &s;cene, and he was not in a very good humour. He &s;aid of a performance that had lately come out, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if you &s;hould &s;earch all the mad-hou&s;es in England, you would not find ten men who would write &s;o, and think it &s;en&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="438" MS="y">
 I was glad when General Oglethorpe's arrival was announced; and we left the ladies. Dr. John&s;on attended him in the parlour, and was as courteous as ever. The General &s;aid he was bu&s;y reading the writers of the middle age. John&s;on &s;aid they were very curious. OGLETHORPE. <Q REND="inline">"The Hou&s;e of Commons has u&s;urped the power of the nation's money, and u&s;ed it tyranni|cally. Government is now carried on by corrupt influence, in&s;tead of the inherent right in the King."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the want of inherent right in the King occa&s;ions all this di&s;turbance. What we did at the Revolution was nece&s;&s;ary: but it broke our con&s;titution <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">I have, in my <Q REND="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</Q> fully expre&s;&s;ed my &s;entiments upon this &s;ubject. The Revolution was <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> but not a &s;ubject for <HI>glory;</HI> becau&s;e it for a long time bla&s;ted the generous feelings of <HI>Loyalty.</HI> And now, when by the benignant effect of time the pre&s;ent Royal Family are e&s;tabli&s;hed in our <HI>affections,</HI> how unwi&s;e is it to revive by celebrations the memory of a &s;hock, which it would &s;urely have been better that our con&s;titution had not required.</NOTE>."</Q> OGLETHORPE. <Q REND="inline">"My father did not think it nece&s;&s;ary."</Q></P>
<P>On Sunday, March 23, I breakfa&s;ted with Dr. John&s;on, who &s;eemed much relieved, having taken opium the night before. He however prote&s;ted again&s;t it, as a remedy that &s;hould be given with the utmo&s;t reluctance, and only in extreme nece&s;&s;ity. I mentioned how commonly it was u&s;ed in Turkey, and therefore it could not be &s;o pernicious as he apprehended. He grew warm, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Turks take opium, and Chri&s;tians take opium; but Ru&s;&s;el, in his account of Aleppo, tells us, that it is as di&s;graceful in Turkey to take too much opium, as it is with us to get drunk. Sir, it is amazing how things are exaggerated. A gentleman was lately telling in a company where I was pre&s;ent, that in France, as &s;oon as a man of fa&s;hion marries, he takes an opera girl into keeping; and this he mentioned as a general cu&s;tom. Pray, Sir, (&s;aid I,) how many opera girls may there be? He an&s;wered, 'About four&s;core.' Well then, Sir, (&s;aid I,) you &s;ee there can be no more than four|&s;core men of fa&s;hion who can do this."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. De&s;moulins made tea; and &s;he and I talked before him upon a topick which he had once borne patiently from me, when we were by our|&s;elves&mdash;his not complaining of the world, becau&s;e he was not called to &s;ome great office, nor had attained to great wealth. He flew into a violent pa&s;&s;ion, I confe&s;s with &s;ome ju&s;tice, and commanded us to have done. <Q REND="inline">"Nobody (&s;aid he) has a right to talk in this manner, to bring before a man his own character, and the events of his life, when he does not choo&s;e it &s;hould be done. I never have &s;ought the world; the world was not to &s;eek me. It is
<PB N="437" REF="439" MS="y">
rather wonderful that &s;o much has been done for me. All the complaints  which are made of the world are unju&s;t. I never knew a man of merit neglected. It was generally by his own fault that he failed of &s;ucce&s;s. A man may hide his head in a hole. He may go into the country, and publi&s;h a book now and then, which nobody reads, and then complain he is neglected. There is no rea&s;on why any per&s;on &s;hould exert him&s;elf for a man who has written a good book. He has not written it for any individual. I may as well make a pre&s;ent to the po&s;t-man who brings me a letter. When patronage was limited, an authour expected to find a Mecaenas, and complained if he did not find one. Why &s;hould he complain? This Mecaenas has others as good as he, or others who have got the &s;tart of him."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But &s;urely, Sir, you will allow that there are many men of merit at the bar who never get practice."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you are &s;ure that practice is got from an opinion that the per&s;on employed de&s;erves it be&s;t; &s;o that if a man of merit at the bar does not get practice, it is from errour, not from inju&s;tice. He is not neglected. A hor&s;e that is brought to market may not be bought, though he is a very good hor&s;e: but that is from ignorance, not from intention."</Q></P>
<P>There was in this di&s;cour&s;e much novelty, ingenuity, and di&s;crimination, &s;uch as is &s;eldom to be found. Yet I cannot help thinking that men of merit, who have no &s;ucce&s;s in life, may be forgiven for <HI>lamenting,</HI> if they are not allowed to <HI>complain.</HI> They may con&s;ider it as <HI>hard</HI> that their merit &s;hould not have its &s;uitable di&s;tinction. If there is no internal inju&s;tice towards them on the part of the world, becau&s;e their merit has not been perceived, they may repine again&s;t <HI>fortune,</HI> or <HI>fate,</HI> or by whatever name they choo&s;e to call the &s;uppo&s;ed mythological power of <HI>De&s;tiny.</HI> It has, however, occurred to me, as a con&s;olatory thought, that men of merit &s;hould con&s;ider thus:&mdash;How much harder would it be if the &s;ame men had both all the merit and all the pro&s;perity? Would not this be a mi&s;erable di&s;tribution for the poor dunces? Would men of merit exchange their intellectual &s;uperiority, and the enjoyments ari&s;ing from it, for external di&s;tinction, and the plea&s;ures of wealth? If they would not, let them not envy others, who are poor where they are rich, a compen&s;ation which is made to them. Let them look inwards and be &s;atisfied; recollecting with con&s;cious pride what Virgil finely &s;ays of the <HI>Corycius Senex,</HI> and which I have, in another place <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Letter to the People of Scotland again&s;t the Attempt to dimini&s;h the Number of the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion. 1785.</NOTE>, with truth and &s;incerity applied to Mr. Burke:
<Q><L>"Regum aequabat opes animis."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="440" MS="y">
 On the &s;ubject of the right employment of wealth, John&s;on ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"A man cannot make a bad u&s;e of his money, &s;o far as regards Society, if he does not hoard it. For if he either &s;pends it or lends it out, Society has the benefit. It is in general better to &s;pend money than to give it away; for indu&s;try is more promoted by &s;pending money, than by giving it away. A man who &s;pends his money is &s;ure he is doing good with it: he is not &s;o &s;ure when he gives it away. A man who &s;pends ten thou&s;and a year will do more good than a man who &s;pends two thou&s;and and gives away eight."</Q></P>
<P>In the evening I came to him again. He was rather fretful from his illne&s;s. A gentleman a&s;ked him, whether he had been abroad to-day. <Q REND="inline">"Don't talk &s;o childi&s;hly, (&s;aid he). You may as well a&s;k if I hanged my|&s;elf to-day."</Q> I mentioned politicks. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I'd as &s;oon have a man to break my bones as talk to me of publick affairs, internal or external. I have lived to &s;ee things all as bad as they can be."</Q></P>
<P>Having mentioned his friend the &s;econd Lord Southwell, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Lord Southwell was the highe&s;t bred man without in&s;olence that I ever was in com|pany with; the mo&s;t <HI>qualified</HI> I ever &s;aw. Lord Orrery was not dignified: Lord Che&s;terfield was, but he was in&s;olent. Lord ********* is a man of coar&s;e manners, but a man of abilities and information. I don't &s;ay he is a man I would &s;et at the head of a nation, though perhaps he may be as good as the next Prime Mini&s;ter that comes. But he is a man to be at the head of a Club;&mdash;I don't &s;ay <HI>our</HI> CLUB;&mdash;for there's no &s;uch Club."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, was not he once a factious man?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"O yes, Sir; as factious a fellow as could be found: one who was for &s;inking us all into the mob."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"How then, Sir, did he get into favour with the King?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e, Sir, I &s;uppo&s;e he promi&s;ed the King to do whatever the King plea&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Gold&s;mith's blundering &s;peech to Lord Shelburne, which has been &s;o often mentioned, and which he really did make to him, was only a blunder in empha&s;is:&mdash;'I wonder they &s;hould call your Lord&s;hip <HI>Malagrida,</HI> for Malagrida was a very good man;'&mdash;meant, I wonder they &s;hould u&s;e <HI>Malagrida</HI> as a term of reproach."</Q></P>
<P>Soon after this time I had an opportunity of &s;eeing, by means of one of his friends, a proof that his talents, as well as his obliging &s;ervice to authours, were ready as ever. He had revi&s;ed <Q REND="inline">"The Village,"</Q> an admirable poem, by the Reverend Mr. Crabbe. Its &s;entiments as to the fal&s;e notions of ru&s;tick happine&s;s and ru&s;tick virtue, were quite congenial with his own; and he had taken the trouble not only to &s;ugge&s;t &s;light corrections and variations, but to
<PB N="439" REF="441" MS="y">
furni&s;h &s;ome lines, when he thought he could give the writer's meaning better  than in the words of the manu&s;cript <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot"><P>I &s;hall give an in&s;tance, marking the original by Roman, and John&s;on's &s;ub&s;titution in Italick characters:</P>

<P>Here we find John&s;on's poetical and critical powers undimini&s;hed. I mu&s;t, however, ob&s;erve, that the aids he gave to this poem, as to <Q REND="inline">"The Traveller"</Q> and <Q REND="inline">"De&s;erted Village"</Q> of Gold&s;mith, were &s;o &s;mall as by no means to impair the di&s;tingui&s;hed merit of the authour&punc;</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>On Sunday, March 30, I found him at home in the evening, and had the plea&s;ure to meet with Dr. Brockle&s;by, who&s;e reading, and knowledge of life, and good &s;pirits, &s;upply him with a never-failing &s;ource of conver&s;ation. He mentioned a re&s;pectable gentleman, who became extremely penurious near the clo&s;e of his life. John&s;on &s;aid there mu&s;t have been a degree of madne&s;s about him. <Q REND="inline">"Not at all Sir, (&s;aid Dr. Brockle&s;by,) his judgement was entire."</Q> Unluckily, however, he mentioned that although he had a fortune of twenty-&s;even thou&s;and pounds, he denied him&s;elf many comforts, from an apprehen&s;ion that he could not afford them. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, (cried John&s;on,) when the judgement is &s;o di&s;turbed that a man cannot count, that is pretty well."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall here in&s;ert a few of John&s;on's &s;ayings, without the formality of dates, as they have no reference to any particular time or place.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The more a man extends and varies his acquaintance the better."</Q> This, however, was meant with a ju&s;t re&s;triction; for, he on another occa&s;ion &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, a man may be &s;o much of every thing, that he is nothing of any thing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Rai&s;ing the wages of day-labourers is wrong; for it does not make them live better, but only makes them idler, and idlene&s;s is a very bad thing for human nature."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="442">
 <Q REND="inline">"It is a very good cu&s;tom to keep a journal for a man's own u&s;e; he may write upon a card a day all that is nece&s;&s;ary to be written, after he has had experience of life. At fir&s;t there is a great deal to be written, becau&s;e there is a great deal of novelty. But when once a man has &s;ettled his opinions, there is &s;eldom much to be &s;et down."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is nothing wonderful in the journal which we &s;ee Swift kept in London, for it contains flight topicks, and it might &s;oon be written."</Q></P>
<P>I prai&s;ed the accuracy of an account book of a private per&s;on whom I mentioned. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Keeping accounts, Sir, is of no u&s;e when a man is &s;pending his own money, and has nobody to whom he is to account. You won't eat le&s;s beef to-day, becau&s;e you have written down what it co&s;t ye&s;terday."</Q> I mentioned a lady who thought as he did, &s;o that her hu&s;band could not get her to keep an account of the expence of the family, as &s;he thought it enough that &s;he never exceeded the &s;um allowed her. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is fit &s;he &s;hould keep an account, becau&s;e her hu&s;band wi&s;hes it; but I do not &s;ee its u&s;e."</Q> I maintained that keeping an account has this advantage, that it &s;atisfies a man that his money has not been lo&s;t or &s;tolen, which he might &s;ometimes be apt to imagine, were there no written &s;tate of his expence; and be&s;ides, a calculation of oeconomy &s;o as not to exceed one's income, cannot be made without a view of the different articles in figures, that one may &s;ee how to retrench in &s;ome particulars le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than others. This he did not attempt to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Talking of an acquaintance of ours, who&s;e narratives, which abounded in curious and intere&s;ting topicks, were unhappily found to be very fabulous; I mentioned Lord Mansfield's having &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"Suppo&s;e we believe one <HI>half</HI> of what he tells."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Aye; but we don't know <HI>which</HI> half to believe. By his lying we lo&s;e not only our reverence for him, but all comfort in his conver&s;ation."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"May we not take it as amu&s;ing fiction?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the misfortune is, that you will in&s;en&s;ibly believe as much of it as you incline."</Q></P>
<P>It is remarkable, that notwith&s;tanding their congeniality in politicks, he never was acquainted with a late eminent noble judge, whom I have heard &s;peak of him as a writer, with great re&s;pect. John&s;on, I know not upon what degree of inve&s;tigation, entertained no exalted opinion of his Lord&s;hip's intel|lectual character. Talking of him to me one day, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It is wonderful, Sir, with how little real &s;uperiority of mind men can make an eminent figure in publick life."</Q> He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the &s;ame purpo&s;e concerning another law Lord, who, it &s;eems, once took a fancy to a&s;&s;ociate with the wits

He is not only dull him&s;elf, but the cau&s;e of dullne&s;s in others."</Q> Trying him by the te&s;t of his colloquial powers, John&s;on had found him very defective. He once &s;aid to Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, <Q REND="inline">"This man now has been ten years about town, and has made nothing of it;"</Q> meaning as a companion <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Knowing as well as I do, what preci&s;ion and elegance of oratory his Lord&s;hip can di&s;play, I cannot but &s;u&s;pect that his unfavourable appearance in a &s;ocial circle, which drew &s;uch animad|ver&s;ions upon him, mu&s;t be owing to a cold affectation of con&s;equence, from being re&s;erved and &s;tiff. If it be &s;o, and he might be an agreeable man if he would, we cannot be &s;orry that he mi&s;&s;es his aim.</NOTE>. He &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"I never heard any thing from him in company that was at all &s;triking; and depend upon it, Sir, it is when you come clo&s;e to a man in conver&s;ation, that you di&s;cover what his real abilities are; to make a &s;peech in a publick a&s;&s;embly is a knack. Now I honour Thurlow, Sir; Thurlow is a fine fellow; he fairly puts his mind to yours."</Q></P>
<P>After repeating to him &s;ome of his pointed lively &s;ayings, I &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It is a pity, Sir, you don't always remember your own good things, that you may have a laugh when you will."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, it is better that I forget them, that I may be reminded of them and have a laugh brought to my recollection."</Q></P>
<P>When I recalled his having &s;aid as we &s;ailed upon Lochlomond, <Q REND="inline">"That if he wore any thing fine, it &s;hould be <HI>very</HI> fine;"</Q> I ob&s;erved that all his thoughts were upon a great &s;cale. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Depend upon it, Sir, every man will have as fine a thing as he can get; as a large diamond for his ring."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Pardon me, Sir; a man of a narrow mind will not think of it, a &s;liight trinket will &s;atisfy him.<Q><L>'Nec &s;ufferre queat majoris pondera gemmae."</L></Q></Q></P>
<P>I told him I &s;hould &s;end him &s;ome <Q REND="inline">"E&s;&s;ays"</Q> which I had written, which I hoped he would be &s;o good as to read, and pick out the good ones. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, &s;end me only the good ones; don't make <HI>me</HI> pick them."</Q></P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, April 10, I introduced to him, at his hou&s;e in Bolt-court, the Honourable and Reverend William Stuart, &s;on of the Earl of Bute; a gentleman truly worthy of being known to John&s;on, being, with all the advantages of high birth, learning, travel, and elegant manners, an exemplary pari&s;h prie&s;t in every re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="444" MS="y">
 After &s;ome compliments on both &s;ides, the tour which John&s;on and I had made to the Hebrides was mentioned.&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I got an acqui&s;ition of more ideas by it than by any thing that I remember. I &s;aw quite a different &s;y&s;tem of life."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"You would not like to make the &s;ame journey again."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why no, Sir; not the &s;ame: it is a tale told. <HI>Gravina,</HI> an Italian critick, ob&s;erves, that every man de&s;ires to &s;ee that of which he has read; but no man de&s;ires to read an account of what he has &s;een. So much does de&s;cription fall &s;hort of reality. De&s;cription only excites curio&s;ity: &s;eeing &s;atisfies it. Other people may go and &s;ee the Hebrides."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould wi&s;h to go and &s;ee &s;ome country totally different from what I have been u&s;ed to; &s;uch as Turkey, where religion and every thing el&s;e are different."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; there are two objects of curio&s;ity&mdash;the Chri&s;tian world and the Mahometan world. All the re&s;t may be con&s;idered as barbarous."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, is the 'Turki&s;h Spy' a genuine book?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir. Mrs. Manley, in her Life, &s;ays, that her father wrote the two fir&s;t volumes. And in another book, 'Dunton's Life and Errours,' we find that the re&s;t was written by one <HI>Sault,</HI> at two guineas a &s;heet, under the direction of Dr. Midgeley."</Q></P>
<P>BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"This has been a very factious reign, owing to the too great indulgence of Government."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> think &s;o, Sir. What at fir&s;t was lenity, grew timidity. Yet this is rea&s;oning <HI>&agrave; po&s;teriori,</HI> and may not be ju&s;t. Suppo&s;ing a few had at fir&s;t been puni&s;hed, I believe faction would have been cru&s;hed; but it might have been &s;aid, that it was a &s;an|guinary reign. A man cannot tell <HI>&agrave; priori</HI> what will be be&s;t for Government to do. This reign has been very unfortunate. We have had an un&s;uc|ce&s;sful war; but that does not prove that we have been ill governed. One &s;ide or other mu&s;t prevail in war, as one or other mu&s;t win at play. When we beat Louis, we were not better governed; nor were the French better governed when Louis beat us."</Q></P>
<P>On Saturday, April 12, I vi&s;ited him, in company with Mr. Windham, of Norfolk, whom, though a Whig, he highly valued. One of the be&s;t things he ever &s;aid was to this gentleman; who, before he &s;et out for Ireland as Secretary to Lord Northington, when Lord Lieutenant, expre&s;&s;ed to the Sage &s;ome mode&s;t and virtuous doubts, whether he could bring him&s;elf to practi&s;e tho&s;e arts which it is &s;uppo&s;ed a per&s;on in that &s;ituation has occa&s;ion to employ. <Q REND="inline">"Don't be afraid, Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on, with a plea&s;ant &s;mile,) you will &s;oon make a very pretty ra&s;cal."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="445" MS="y">
He talked to-day a good deal of the wonderful extent and variety of London,  and ob&s;erved, that men of curious enquiry might &s;ee in it &s;uch modes of life as very few could even imagine. He in particular recommended to us to <HI>explore Wapping,</HI> which we re&s;olved to do, and certainly &s;hall.</P>
<P>Mr. Lowe the painter, who was with him, was very much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed that a large picture which he had painted was refu&s;ed to be received into the exhi|bition of the Royal Academy. Mrs. Thrale knew John&s;on's character &s;o &s;uperficially, as to repre&s;ent him as unwilling to do &s;mall acts of benevolence; and mentions, in particular, that he would hardly take the trouble to write a letter in favour of his friends. The truth, however, is, that he was remark|able, in an extraordinary degree, for what &s;he denies to him; and, above all, for this very &s;ort of kindne&s;s, writing letters for tho&s;e to whom his &s;olicitations might be of &s;ervice. He now gave Mr. Lowe the following, of which I was diligent enough, with his permi&s;&s;ion, to take copies at the next coffee|hou&s;e, while Mr. Windham was &s;o good as to &s;tay by me.</P>

<P>Such interce&s;&s;ion was too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted, and Mr. Lowe's per|formance was admitted at Somer&s;et-hou&s;e. The &s;ubject, as I recollect, was the Deluge, at that point of time when the water was verging to the top of the la&s;t uncovered mountain. Near to the &s;pot was &s;een the la&s;t of the antediluvian race, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e who were &s;aved in the ark of Noah. This was one of tho&s;e giants, then the inhabitants of the earth, who had &s;till &s;trength to &s;wim, and with one of his hands held aloft his infant child. Upon the &s;mall remaining dry &s;pot appeared a fami&s;hed lion, ready to &s;pring at the child and devour it. Mr. Lowe told me that John&s;on &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, yonr picture is noble and probable."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"A compliment, indeed, (&s;aid Mr. Lowe,) from a man who cannot lie, and cannot be mi&s;taken."</Q></P>
<P>About this time he wrote to Mrs. Lucy Porter, mentioning his bad health, and that he intended a vi&s;it to Lichfield. <Q REND="inline">"It is (&s;ays he) with no great expectation of amendment that I make every year a journey into the country; but it is plea&s;ant to vi&s;it tho&s;e who&s;e kindne&s;s has been often experienced."</Q></P>
<P>On April 18, (being Good-Friday,) I found him at breakfa&s;t, in his u&s;ual manner upon that day, drinking tea without milk, and eating a cro&s;s-bun to prevent faintne&s;s; we went to St. Clement's church, as formerly. When we came home from church he placed him&s;elf on one of the &s;tone &s;eats at his garden-door, and I took the other, and thus in the open air and in a placid frame, he talked away very ea&s;ily. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Were I a country gentleman, I &s;hould not be very ho&s;pitable, I &s;hould not have crowds in my hou&s;e."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Sir Alexander Dick tells me, that he remembers having a thou&s;and people in a year to dine at his hou&s;e; that is reckoning each per&s;on one each time that he dined there."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"That, Sir, is about three a day."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"How your &s;tatement le&s;&s;ens the idea."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"That, Sir, is the good of counting. It brings every thing to a certainty which before floated in the mind indefinitely."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But <HI>Omne</HI>
<PB N="445" REF="447" MS="y">

And if there is a large family the poor entertain tho&s;e three, for they eat what the poor would get; there mu&s;t be &s;uperfluous meat; it mu&s;t be given to the poor, or thrown out."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I ob&s;erve in London, that the poor go about and gather bones, which I under&s;tand are manufactured.</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; they boil them, and extract a grea&s;e from them for grea&s;ing wheels and other purpo&s;es. Of the be&s;t pieces they make a mock ivory, which is u&s;ed for hafts to knives, and various other things. The coar&s;er pieces they burn and pound them, and &s;ell the a&s;hes."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"For what purpo&s;e, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, for making a furnace for the chymi&s;ts for melting iron. A pa&s;te made of burnt bones will &s;tand a &s;tronger heat than any thing el&s;e. Con&s;ider, Sir, if you are to melt iron, you cannot line your pot with bra&s;s, becau&s;e it is &s;ofter than iron and would melt &s;ooner; nor with iron, for though malleable iron is harder than ca&s;t iron, yet it would not do; but a pa&s;te of burnt bones will not melt."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Do you know, Sir, I have di&s;covered a ma|nufacture to a great extent, of what you only piddle at&mdash;&s;craping and drying the peel of oranges. At a place in Newgate-&s;treet, there is a prodigious quantity done, which they &s;ell to the di&s;tillers."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I believe they make a higher thing out of them than a &s;pirit; they make what is called orange-butter, the oil of the orange in&s;pi&s;&s;ated, which they mix perhaps with common pomatum, and make it fragrant. The oil does not fly off in the drying."</Q></P>
<P>BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h to have a good walled garden."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I don't think it would be worth the expence to you. We compute in England, a park-wall at a thou&s;and pounds a mile; now a garden-wall mu&s;t co&s;t at lea&s;t as much. You intend your trees &s;hould grow higher than a deer will leap. Now let us &s;ee&mdash;for a hundred pounds you could only have forty-four &s;quare yards, which is very little; for two hundred pounds, you may have eighty-four &s;quare yards, which is very well. But when will you get the value of two hundred pounds of walls in your climate? No, Sir, &s;uch contention with nature is not worth while. I would plant an orchard, and have plenty of &s;uch fruit as ripen well in your country. My friend, Dr. Madan, of Ireland, &s;aid, that in an orchard there &s;hould be enough to eat, enough to lay up, enough to be &s;tolen, and enough to rot upon the ground. Cherries are an early fruit, you may have them; and you may have the early apples and
<PB N="446" REF="448" MS="y">
 pears."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"We cannot have nonpareils."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you can no more have nonpareils than you can have grapes."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"We have them, Sir; but they are very bad."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, never try to have a thing merely to &s;hew that you <HI>cannot</HI> have it. For ground that would let for forty &s;hillings you may have a large orchard; and you &s;ee it co&s;ts you only forty &s;hillings. Nay, you may graze the ground when the trees are grown up, you cannot while they are young."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Is not a good garden a very common thing in England, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Not &s;o common, Sir, as you imagine. In Lincoln&s;hire there is hardly an orchard; in Stafford&s;hire very little fruit."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Has Langton no orchard?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"How &s;o, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, from the general negligence of the county. He has it not, becau&s;e nobody el&s;e has it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"A hot-hou&s;e is a certain thing; I may have that."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"A hot-hou&s;e is pretty certain; but you mu&s;t fir&s;t build it, then you mu&s;t keep fires in it, and you mu&s;t have a gardener to take care of it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But if I have a gardener at any rate."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, yes."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I'd have it near my hou&s;e; there is no need to have it in the orchard."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">Yes, I'd have it near my hou&s;e&mdash;I would plant a great many currants; the fruit is good, and they make a pretty &s;weetmeat."</Q></P>
<P>I record this minute detail, which &s;ome may think trifling, in order to &s;hew clearly how this great man, who&s;e mind could gra&s;p &s;uch large and exten&s;ive &s;ubjects as he has &s;hewn in his literary labours, was yet well-informed in the common affairs of life, and loved to illu&s;trate them.</P>
<P>Mr. Walker, the celebrated ma&s;ter of elocution came, and then we went up &s;tairs into the &s;tudy. I a&s;ked him if he had taught many clergymen. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I hope not."</Q> WALKER. <Q REND="inline">"I have taught only one, and he is the be&s;t reader I ever heard, not by my teaching, but by his own natural talents."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Were he the be&s;t reader in the world, I would not have it told that he was taught."</Q> Here was one of his peculiar prejudices. Could it be any di&s;advantage to the clergyman, to have it known that he was taught an ea&s;y and graceful delivery? BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Will you not allow, Sir, that a man may be taught to read well?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, &s;o far as to read better than he might do without being taught, yes. Formerly it was &s;uppo&s;ed that there was no difference in reading, but that one read as well as another."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"It is wonderful to &s;ee old Sheridan as enthu&s;ia&s;tick about oratory as ever."</Q> WALKER. <Q REND="inline">"His enthu&s;ia&s;m as to what oratory will do may be too great. But he reads well."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"He
<PB N="447" REF="449" MS="y">
reads well, but he reads low; and you know it is much ea&s;ier to read low  than to read high; for when you read high you are much more limited, your loude&s;t note can be but one, and &s;o in proportion to loudne&s;s. Now &s;ome people have occa&s;ion to &s;peak to an exten&s;ive audience, and mu&s;t &s;peak loud to be heard."</Q> WALKER. <Q REND="inline">"The art is to read &s;trong, though low."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of the origin of language&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It mu&s;t have come by in&s;piration. A thou&s;and, nay a million of children could not invent a lan|guage. While the organs are pliable, there is not under&s;tanding enough to form a language: by the time that there is under&s;tanding enough, the organs are become &s;tiff. We know that after a certain age we cannot learn to pronounce a new language. No foreigner, who comes to England when advanced in life, ever pronounces Engli&s;h tolerably well; at lea&s;t &s;uch in&s;tances are very rare. When I maintain that language mu&s;t have come by in&s;piration, I do not mean that in&s;piration is required for rhetorick, and all the beauties of language; for when once man has language, we can conceive that he may gradually form modifications of it. I mean only, that in&s;piration &s;eems to me to be nece&s;&s;ary to give man the faculty of &s;peech; to inform him that he may have &s;peech; which I think he could no more find out without in&s;piration, than cows or hogs would think of &s;uch a faculty."</Q> WALKER. <Q REND="inline">"Do you think, Sir, that there are any perfect &s;ynonimes in any language?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Originally there were not; but by u&s;ing words negligently, or in poetry, one word comes to be confounded with another."</Q></P>
<P>He talked of Dr. Dodd. <Q REND="inline">"A friend of mine (&s;aid he) came to me and told me, that a lady wi&s;hed to have Dodd's picture in a bracelet, and a&s;ked me for a motto. I &s;aid, I could think of no better than <HI>Currat Lex.</HI> I was very willing to have him pardoned, that is, to have the &s;entence changed to tran&s;portation: but, when he was once hanged, I did not wi&s;h he &s;hould be made a &s;aint."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Burney, wife of his friend Dr. Burney, came in, and he &s;eemed to be entertained with her conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Garrick's funeral was talked of as extravagantly expen&s;ive. John&s;on, from his di&s;like to exaggeration, would not allow that it was di&s;tingui&s;hed by any extraordinary pomp. <Q REND="inline">"Were there not &s;ix hor&s;es in each coach?"</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Burney. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Madam, there were no more &s;ix hor&s;es than &s;ix phoenixes."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Burney wondered that &s;ome very beautiful new buildings &s;hould be erected in Moorfields, in &s;o &s;hocking a &s;ituation as between Bedlam and St. Luke's Ho&s;pital; and &s;aid, &s;he could not live there. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay,
<PB N="448" REF="450" MS="y">
 Madam, you &s;ee nothing there to hurt you. You no more think of mad|ne&s;s by having windows that look to Bedlam, than you think of death by having windows that look to a church-yard."</Q> MRS. BURNEY. <Q REND="inline">"We may look to a church-yard, Sir; for it is right that we &s;hould be kept in mind of death."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Madam, if you go to that it is right that we &s;hould be kept in mind of madne&s;s, which is occa&s;ioned by too much indulgence of imagination. I think a very moral u&s;e may be made of the&s;e new buildings. I would have tho&s;e who have heated imaginations live there, and take warning."</Q> MRS. BURNEY. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, many of the poor people that are mad have become &s;o from di&s;ea&s;e, or from di&s;tre&s;&s;ing events. It is, therefore, not their faults, but their misfortune; and, therefore, to think of them, is a melancholy con&s;ideration."</Q></P>
<P>Time pa&s;&s;ed on in conver&s;ation till it was too late for the &s;ervice of the church at three o'clock. I took a walk, and left him alone for &s;ome time; then returned, and we had coffee and conver&s;ation again by our&s;elves.</P>
<P>I &s;tated the character of a noble friend of mine, as a curious ca&s;e for his opinion:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He is the mo&s;t inexplicable man to me that I ever knew. Can you explain him, Sir? He is, I really believe, noble-minded, generous, and princely. But his mo&s;t intimate friends may be &s;eparated from him for years, without his ever a&s;king a que&s;tion concerning them. He will meet them with a formality, a coldne&s;s, a &s;tately indifference; but when they come clo&s;e to him, and fairly engage him in conver&s;ation, they find him as ea&s;y, plea&s;ant, and kind as they could wi&s;h. One then &s;uppo&s;es that what is &s;o agreeable will &s;oon be renewed; but &s;tay away from him for half a year, and he will neither call on you, nor &s;end to inquire about you."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I cannot a&s;certain his character exactly, as I do not know him; but I &s;hould not like to have &s;uch a man for my friend. He may love &s;tudy, and wi&s;h not to be interrupted by his friends; <HI>Amici fures temporis.</HI> He may be a frivolous man, and be &s;o much occupied with petty pur&s;uits, that he may not want friends. Or he may have a notion that there is a dignity in appearing indifferent, while he in fact may not be more indifferent at his heart than another."</Q></P>
<P>We went to evening prayers at St. Clement's, at &s;even, and then parted.</P>
<P>On Sunday, April 20, being Ea&s;ter-day, after attending &s;olemn &s;ervice at St. Paul's, I came to Dr. John&s;on, and found Mr. Lowe, the painter, &s;itting with him. Mr. Lowe mentioned the great number of new buildings of late in London, yet that Dr. John&s;on had ob&s;erved, that the number of inhabitants was not increa&s;ed. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, the bills of mortality prove that
<PB N="449" REF="451">
no more people die now than formerly; &s;o it is plain no more live. Births  are nothing, for not one tenth of the people of London are born there."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I believe, Sir, a great many of the children born in London die early."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, Sir."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But tho&s;e who do live are as &s;tout and &s;trong people as any. Dr. Price &s;ays, they mu&s;t be naturally &s;tronger to get through."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"That is &s;y&s;tem, Sir. A great traveller ob&s;erves, that it is &s;aid there are no weak or deformed people among the Indians; but he with much &s;agacity a&s;&s;igns the rea&s;on of this, which is, that the hard&s;hip of their life as hunters and fi&s;hers, does not allow weak or di&s;ea&s;ed children to grow up. Now had I been an Indian I mu&s;t have died early, my eyes would not have &s;erved me to get food. I indeed now could fi&s;h, give me Engli&s;h tackle; but had I been an Indian I mu&s;t have &s;tarved, or they would have knocked me on the head when they &s;aw I could do nothing."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Perhaps they would have taken care of you; we are told they are fond of oratory, you would have talked to them."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, I &s;hould not have lived long enough to be fit to talk; I &s;hould have been dead before I was ten years old. Depend upon it, Sir, a &s;avage when he is hungry will not carry about with him a looby of nine years old, who cannot help him&s;elf. They have no affection, Sir."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I believe natural affection of which we hear &s;o much, is very &s;mall."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, natural affection is nothing. But affection from principle and e&s;tabli&s;hed duty is &s;ometimes wonderfully &s;trong."</Q> LOWE. <Q REND="inline">"A hen, Sir, will feed her chickens in preference to her&s;elf."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But we don't know that the hen is hungry; let the hen be fairly hungry, and I'll warrant &s;he'll peck the corn her&s;elf. A cock, I believe, will feed hens in&s;tead of him&s;elf; but we don't know that the cock is hungry."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"And that, Sir, is not from affection but gallantry. But &s;ome of the Indians have affection."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, that they help &s;ome of their children is plain; for &s;ome of them live which could not do without being helped."</Q></P>
<P>I dined with him; the company were, Mrs. Williams, Mrs. De&s;moulins, and Mr. Lowe. He &s;eemed not to be well, talked little, grew drow&s;y &s;oon after dinner and retired, upon which I went away.</P>
<P>Having next day gone to Mr. Burke's &s;eat in the country, from whence I was recalled by an expre&s;s, that a near relation of mine had killed his antagoni&s;t in a duel, and was him&s;elf dangerou&s;ly wounded, I &s;aw little of Dr. John&s;on till Monday, April 28, when I &s;pent a con&s;iderable part of the
<PB N="450" REF="452" MS="y">
 day with him, and introduced the &s;ubject, which chiefly occupied my mind. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I do not &s;ee, Sir, that fighting is ab&s;olutely forbidden in Scripture; I &s;ee revenge forbidden, but not &s;elf-defence."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"The Quakers &s;ay it is; <Q REND="inline">"Unto him that &s;miteth thee on one cheek, offer al&s;o the other."</Q></Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But &s;tay, Sir, the text is meant only to have the effect of moderating pa&s;&s;ion; it is plain that we are not to take it in a literal &s;en&s;e. We &s;ee this from the context, where there are other recommendations, which I warrant you the Quaker will not take literally, as for in&s;tance, 'From him that would borrow of thee, turn thou not away.' Let a man who&s;e credit is bad come to a Quaker, and &s;ay, 'Well, Sir, lend me a hundred pounds;' he'll find him as unwilling as any other man. No, Sir, a man may &s;hoot the man who invades his character, as he may &s;hoot him who attempts to break into his hou&s;e."</Q> So in 1745, my friend, Tom Cumming, the Quaker, &s;aid, he would not fight, but he would drive an ammunition-cart; and we know that the Quakers have &s;ent flannel wai&s;tcoats to our &s;oldiers, to enable them to fight better BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"When a man is the aggre&s;&s;or, and by ill-u&s;age forces on a duel in which he is killed, have we not little ground to hope that he is gone into a &s;tate of happine&s;s?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, we are not to judge determinately of the &s;tate in which a man leaves this life. He may in a moment have repented effectually, and it is po&s;&s;ible may have been accepted by GOD. There is in 'Camden's Remains,' an epitaph upon a very wicked man, who was killed by a fail from his hor&s;e, in which he is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ay,
<Q><L>'Between the &s;tirrup and the ground,</L>
<L>'I mercy a&s;ked, I mercy found."</L></Q></Q>
BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Is not the expre&s;&s;ion in the Burial-&s;ervice, 'In the <HI>&s;ure</HI> and <HI>certain</HI> hope of a ble&s;&s;ed re&s;urrection;' too &s;trong to be u&s;ed indi&s;criminately, and, indeed, &s;ometimes when tho&s;e over who&s;e bodies it is &s;aid have been notoriou&s;ly profane?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It is &s;ure and certain <HI>hope,</HI> Sir; not <HI>belief.</HI>"</Q> I did not in&s;i&s;t further; but cannot help thinking that le&s;s po&s;itive words would be more proper.</P>
<P>Talking of a man who was grown very fat, &s;o as to be incommoded with corpulency; he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He eats too much, Sir."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I don't know, Sir, you will &s;ee one man &s;at who eats moderately, and another lean who eats a great deal."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, whatever may be the quantity that a man eats, it is plain that if he is too fat, he has eaten more than he &s;hould have done. One man may have a dige&s;tion that con&s;umes food better than common; but it is certain that &s;olidity is encrea&s;ed by putting &s;omething to
<PB N="451" REF="453" MS="y">
it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But may not &s;olids &s;well and be di&s;tended?"</Q> JOHNSON.  <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, they may &s;well and be di&s;tended; but that is not fat."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of the accu&s;ation again&s;t a gentleman for &s;uppo&s;ed delinquencies in India. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"What foundation there is for accu&s;ation I know not, but they will not get at him. Where bad actions are committed at &s;o great a di&s;tance, a delinquent can ob&s;cure the evidence till the &s;cent becomes cold; there is a cloud between, which cannot be penetrated, therefore all di&s;tant power is bad. I am clear that the be&s;t plan for the government of India is a de&s;potick governour; for if he be a good man it is evidently the be&s;t government; and &s;uppo&s;ing him to be a bad man, it is better to have one plunderer than many. A governour who&s;e power is checked, lets others plunder that he him&s;elf may be allowed to plunder. But if de&s;potick, he &s;ees that the more he lets others plunder the le&s;s there will be for him&s;elf, &s;o he re&s;trains them; and though he him&s;elf plunders, the country is a gainer, compared with being plundered by numbers."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned the very liberal payment which had been received for review|ing; and, as evidence of this, that it had been proved in a trial that Dr. Shebbeare had received &s;ix guineas a &s;heet for that kind of literary labour. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he might get &s;ix guineas for a particular &s;heet, but not <HI>communibus &s;heetibus.</HI>"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, by a &s;heet of review is it meant that it &s;hall be all of the writer's own compo&s;ition; or are extracts, made from the book reviewed, deducted?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir: it is a &s;heet, no matter of what."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I think that it is not rea&s;onable."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, it is. A man will more ea&s;ily write a &s;heet all his own than read an octavo volume to get extracts."</Q> To one of John&s;on's wonderful fertility of mind, I believe writing was really ea&s;ier than reading and extract|ing; but with ordinary men the ca&s;e is very different. A great deal, indeed, will depend upon the care and judgement with which the extracts are made. I can &s;uppo&s;e the operation to be tedious and difficult: but in many in&s;tances we mu&s;t ob&s;erve crude mor&s;els cut out of books as if at random; and when a large extract is made from one place, it &s;urely may be done with very little trouble. One, however, I mu&s;t acknowledge, might be led, from the practice of Reviewers, to &s;uppo&s;e that they take a plea&s;ure in original writing; for we often find that, in&s;tead of giving an accurate account of what has been done by the authour who&s;e work they are reviewing, which is &s;urely the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of a literary journal, they produce &s;ome plau&s;ible and ingenious con|ceits of their own, upon the topicks which have been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.</P>

 Upon being told that old Mr. Sheridan, indignant at the neglect of his oratorical plans, had threatened to go to America;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I hope he will go to America."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"The Americans don't want oratory."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But we can want Sheridan."</Q></P>
<P>On Monday, April 29, I found him at home in the forenoon, and Mr. Seward with him. Horace having b&egrave;en mentioned;&mdash;BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"There is a great deal of thinking in his works.

This was merely poetical."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"There are, I am afraid, many people who have no religion at all."</Q> SEWARD. <Q REND="inline">"And &s;en&s;ible people too."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, not &s;en&s;ible in that re&s;pect.

They have not the fir&s;t notion. A man who has never had religion before, no more grows religious when he is &s;ick, than a man who has never learnt figures can count when he has need of calculation."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned a worthy friend of ours whom we valued much, but ob&s;erved that he was too ready to introduce religious di&s;cour&s;e upon all occa&s;ions. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, Sir, he will introduce religious di&s;cour&s;e without &s;ee|ing whether it will end in in&s;truction and improvement, or produce &s;ome profane je&s;t. He would introduce it in the company of Wilkes, and twenty more &s;uch."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned Dr. John&s;on's excellent di&s;tinction between liberty of con|&s;cience and liberty of teaching. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Con&s;ider, Sir; if you have children whom you wi&s;h to educate in the principles of the Church of England, and there comes a Quaker who tries to pervert them to his prin|ciples; you would drive away the Quaker. You would not tru&s;t to the

If we three &s;hould di&s;cu&s;s even the great que&s;tion concerning the exi&s;tence of a Supreme Being by our&s;elves, we &s;hould not be re&s;trained; for that would be to put an end to all improvement. But if we &s;hould di&s;cu&s;s it in the pre&s;ence of ten boarding-&s;chool girls, and as many boys, I think the magi&s;trate would do well to put us in the &s;tocks, to fini&s;h the debate there."</Q></P>
<P>Lord Hailes had &s;ent him a pre&s;ent of a curious little printed poem, on repairing the Univer&s;ity of Aberdeen, by David <HI>Malloch,</HI> which he thought would plea&s;e John&s;on, as affording clear evidence that Mallet had appeared even as a literary character by the name of <HI>Malloch;</HI> his changing which to one of &s;ofter &s;ound, had given John&s;on occa&s;ion to introduce him into his Dictionary, under the article <HI>Alias.</HI> This piece was, I &s;uppo&s;e, one of Mallet's fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays. It is pre&s;erved in his works, with &s;everal variations. John&s;on now read aloud, from the beginning of it, where there were &s;ome common-place a&s;&s;ertions as to the &s;uperiority of ancient times. <Q REND="inline">"How fal&s;e is all this to &s;ay that in ancient times learning was not a di&s;grace to a Peer as it is now. In ancient times a Peer was as ignorant as any one el&s;e. He would have been angry to have it thought he could write his name. Men in ancient times dared to &s;tand forth with a degree of ignorance with which nobody would dare now to &s;tand forth. I am always angry when I hear ancient times prai&s;ed at the expence of modern times. There is now a great deal more learning in the world than than there was formerly; for it is uni|ver&s;ally diffu&s;ed. You have, perhaps, no man who knows as much Greek and Latin as Bentley; or no man who knows as much mathematicks as Newton: but you have many more men who know Greek and Latin, and who know mathematicks."</Q></P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, May 1, I vi&s;ited him in the evening along with young Mr. Burke. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It is &s;trange that there &s;hould be &s;o little reading in the world, and &s;o much writing. People in general do not willingly read, if they can have any thing el&s;e to amu&s;e them. There mu&s;t be an external impul&s;e; emulation, or vanity, or avarice. The progre&s;s which the under|&s;tanding makes through a book, has more pain than plea&s;ure in it. Language is &s;canty, and inadequate to expre&s;s the nice gradations and mixtures of our
<PB N="454" REF="456" MS="y">
 feelings. No man reads a book of &s;cience from pure inclination. The books that we do read with plea&s;ure are light compo&s;itions, which contain a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events. However, I have this year read all Virgil through. I read a book of the Aeneid every night, &s;o it was done in twelve nights, and I had great delight in it. The Georgicks did not give me &s;o much plea|&s;ure, except the fourth book. The Eclogues I have almo&s;t all by heart. I do no think the &s;tory of the Aeneid intere&s;ting. I like the &s;tory of the Ody&s;&s;ey much better; and this not on account of the wonderful things which it contains; for there are wonderful things enough in the Aeneid;&mdash;the &s;hips of the Trojans turned to &s;ea-nymphs&mdash;the tree at Polydorus's tomb dropping blood. The &s;tory of the Ody&s;&s;ey is intere&s;ting, as a great part of it is dome&s;tick. It has been &s;aid, there is plea&s;ure in writing, particularly in writing ver&s;es. I allow you may have plea&s;ure from writing after it is over, if you have written well; but you don't go willingly to it again. I know when I have been writing ver&s;es, I have run my finger down the margin to &s;ee how many I had made, and how few I had to make."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;eemed to be in a very placid humour, and although I have no note of the particulars of young Mr. Burke's conver&s;ation, it is but ju&s;tice to mention in general, that it was &s;uch that Dr. John&s;on &s;aid to me afterwards, <Q REND="inline">"He did very well indeed; I have a mind to tell his father."</Q></P>

I never would &s;ell my vote, and I &s;hould be vexed if things went wrong."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"That's cant, Sir. It would not vex you more in the hou&s;e, than in the gallery. Publick affairs vex no man."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Have not they vexed your&s;elf a little, Sir? Have not you been vexed by all the turbulence of this reign, and by that ab&s;urd vote of the Hou&s;e of Commons, 'That the influence of the Crown has increa&s;ed, is increa&s;ing, and ought to be dimini&s;hed'?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I have never &s;lept an hour le&s;s, nor eat an ounce le&s;s meat. I would have knocked the factious dogs on the head, to be &s;ure; but I was not <HI>vexed.</HI>"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I declare, Sir, upon my honour, I did imagine I was vexed, and took a pride in it. But it <HI>was,</HI> perhaps, cant; for I own I neither eat le&s;s nor &s;lept le&s;s."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"My dear friend, clear your <HI>mind</HI> of cant. You may <HI>talk</HI> as other people do. You may &s;ay to a man, 'Sir, I am your
<PB N="455" REF="457" MS="y">
mo&s;t humble &s;ervant.' You are <HI>not</HI> his mo&s;t humble &s;ervant. You may &s;ay,  'The&s;e are &s;ad times; it is a melancholy thing to be re&s;erved to &s;uch times.' You don't mind the times. You tell a man, 'I am &s;orry you had &s;uch bad weather the la&s;t day of your journey, and were &s;o much wet.' You don't care &s;ix-pence whether he was wet or dry. You may <HI>talk</HI> in this manner; it is a mode of talking in Society: but don't <HI>think</HI> fooli&s;hly."</Q></P>
<P>I talked of living in the country. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Don't &s;et up for what is called ho&s;pitality; it is a wa&s;te of time, and a wa&s;te of money; you are eat up, and not the more re&s;pected for your liberality. If your hou&s;e be like an inn, nobody cares for you. A man who &s;tays a week with another, makes him a &s;lave for a week."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But there are people, Sir, who make their hou&s;es a home to their gue&s;ts, and are them&s;elves quite ea&s;y."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, home mu&s;t be the &s;ame to the gue&s;ts, and they need not come."</Q></P>
<P>Here he di&s;covered a notion common enough in per&s;ons not much accu&s;tomed to entertain company; that there mu&s;t be a degree of elaborate attention otherwi&s;e company will think them&s;elves neglected; and &s;uch attention is no doubt very fatiguing. He proceeded, <Q REND="inline">"I would not, however, be a &s;tranger in my own county; I would vi&s;it my neighbours, and receive their vi&s;its; but I would not be in ha&s;te to return vi&s;its. If a gentleman comes to &s;ee me, I tell him he does me a great deal of honour. I do not go to &s;ee him perhaps for ten weeks, then we are very complai&s;ant to each other. No, Sir, you will have much more influence by giving or lending money where it is wanted, than by ho&s;pitality."</Q></P>
<P>On Saturday, May 17, I &s;aw him for a &s;hort time. Having mentioned that I had that morning been with old Mr. Sheridan, he remembered their former intimacy with a cordial warmth, and &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"Tell Mr. Sheridan, I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee him and &s;hake hands with him."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"It is to me very wonderful that re&s;entment &s;hould be kept up &s;o long."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, it is not altogether re&s;entment that he does not vi&s;it me; it is partly falling out of the habit&mdash;partly di&s;gu&s;t, as one has at a drug that has made him &s;ick. Be&s;ides, he knows that I laugh at his oratory."</Q></P>
<P>Another day I &s;poke of one of our friends, of whom he, as well as I, had a very high opinion. He expatiated in his prai&s;e; but added, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he is a cur&s;ed Whig, a <HI>bottomle&s;s</HI> Whig, as they all are now."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned my expectations from the intere&s;t of an eminent per&s;on then in power; adding, <Q REND="inline">"but I have no claim but the claim of friend&s;hip. However, &s;ome people will go a great way from that motive."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, they
<PB N="456" REF="458">
 will go all the way from that motive."</Q> A gentleman talked of retiring. <Q REND="inline">"Never think of that,"</Q> &s;aid John&s;on. The gentleman urged, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould then do no ill."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nor no good either. Sir, it would be a civil &s;uicide."</Q></P>
<P>On Monday, May 26, I found him at tea, and the celebrated Mi&s;s Burney, the authour of <Q REND="inline">"Evelina and Cecilia"</Q> with him. I a&s;ked if there would be any &s;peakers in parliament, if there were no places to be obtained? JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir. Why do you &s;peak here? Either to in&s;truct and entertain, which is a benevolent motive; or for di&s;tinction, which is a &s;elfi&s;h motive."</Q> I mentioned <Q REND="inline">"Cecilia."</Q> JOHNSON. (with an air of animated &s;atisfaction) <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if you talk of 'Cecilia,' talk on."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of Mr. Barry's exhibition of his pictures. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"What|ever the hand may have done, the mind has done its part. There is a gra&s;p of mind there which you find no where el&s;e <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">In Mr. Barry's printed analy&s;is, or de&s;cription of the&s;e pictures&punc; he &s;peaks of John&s;on's character in the highe&s;t terms.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>I a&s;ked whether a man naturally virtuous, or one who has overcome wicked inclinations is the be&s;t. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, to <HI>you,</HI> the man who has overcome wicked inclinations is not the be&s;t. He has more merit to <HI>him&s;elf.</HI> I would rather tru&s;t my money to a man who has no hands, and &s;o a phy&s;ical impo&s;&s;ibility to &s;teal, than to a man of the mo&s;t hone&s;t principles. There is a witty &s;atirical &s;tory of Foote. He had a &s;mall bu&s;t of Garrick placed upon his bureau. 'You may be &s;urprized (&s;aid he) that I allow him to be &s;o near my gold;&mdash;but you will ob&s;erve he has no hands."</Q></P>
<P>On Friday, May 29, being to &s;et out for Scotland next morning, I pa&s;&s;ed a part of the day with him in more than u&s;ual earne&s;tne&s;s; as his health was in a more precarious &s;tate than at any time when I had parted from him. He however was quick and lively, and critical as u&s;ual. I mentioned one who was a very learned man. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, he has a great deal of learning; but it never lies &s;traight. There is never one idea by the &s;ide of another; 'tis all entangled: and then he drives it &s;o aukwardly upon con|ver&s;ation."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;tated to him an anxious thought, by which a &s;incere Chri&s;tian might be di&s;turbed, even when con&s;cious of having lived a good life, &s;o far as is con|&s;i&s;tent with human infirmity; he might fear that he &s;hould afterwards fall away, and be guilty of &s;uch crimes as would render all his former religion vain. <Q REND="inline">Could there be, upon this aweful &s;ubject, &s;uch a thing as balancing
<PB N="457" REF="459" MS="y">
of accounts? Suppo&s;e a man who has led a good life for &s;even years, com|mits  an act of wickedne&s;s, and in&s;tantly dies; will his former good life have any effect in his favour?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if a man has led a good life for &s;even years, and then is hurried by pa&s;&s;ion to do what is wrong, and is &s;uddenly carried off, depend upon it he will have the reward of his &s;even years' good life; GOD will not take a catch of him. Upon this principle Richard Baxter believes, that a Suicide may be &s;aved. 'If (&s;ays he) it &s;hould be objected that what I maintain may encourage &s;uicide, I an&s;wer, I am not to tell a lie to prevent it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But does not the text &s;ay, 'As the tree falls, &s;o it mu&s;t lye'?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; as the tree falls. But&mdash;(after a little pau&s;e)&mdash;that is meant as to the general &s;tate of the tree, not what is the effect of a &s;udden bla&s;t."</Q> In &s;hort, he interpreted the expre&s;&s;ion as refer|ing to condition, not to po&s;ition. The common notion, therefore, &s;eems to be erroneous; and Shen&s;tone's witty remark on Divines trying to give the tree a jerk upon a death-bed, to make it lye favourably, is not well founded.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him what works of Richard Baxter's I &s;hould read. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Read any of them; they are all good."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Get as much force of mind as you can. Live within your income. Always have &s;omething &s;aved at the end of the year. Let your imports be more than your exports, and you'll never go far wrong."</Q></P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured him, that in the exten&s;ive and various range of his acquaintance there never had been any one who had a more &s;incere re&s;pect and affection for him than I had. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I believe it, Sir. Were I in di&s;tre&s;s, there is no man to whom I &s;hould &s;ooner come than to you. I &s;hould like to come and have a cottage in your park, toddle about, live mo&s;tly on milk, and be taken care of by Mrs. Bo&s;well. She and I are good friends now; are we not?"</Q></P>
<P>Talking of devotion, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Though it be true that 'GOD dwelleth not in temples made with hands,' yet in this &s;tate of being our minds are more piou&s;ly affected in places appropriated to divine wor&s;hip, than in others. Some people have a particular room in their hou&s;e where they &s;ay their prayers, of which I do not di&s;approve, as it may animate their devotion."</Q></P>
<P>He embraced me, and gave me his ble&s;&s;ing, as u&s;ual when I was leaving him for any length of time. I walked from his door to-day with a fearful apprehen&s;ion of what might happen before I returned.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>On Monday the 16th I &s;at for my picture, and walked a con&s;iderable way with little inconvenience. In the afternoon and evening I felt my&s;elf light and ea&s;y, and began to plan &s;chemes of life. Thus I went to bed, and in a &s;hort time walked and &s;at up, as has been long my cu&s;tom, when I felt a confu&s;ion and indi&s;tinctne&s;s in my head, which la&s;ted, I &s;uppo&s;e, about half a minute. I was alarmed, and prayed GOD, that however he might afflict my body, he would &s;pare my under&s;tanding. This prayer, that I might try the integrity of my faculties, I made in Latin ver&s;e. The lines were not very good, but I knew them not to be very good: I made them ea&s;ily, and concluded my&s;elf to be unimpaired in my faculties.</P>
<P>Soon after I perceived that I had &s;uffered a paralytick &s;troke, and that my &s;peech was taken from me. I had no pain, and &s;o little dejection in this dreadful &s;tate, that I wondered at my own apathy, and con&s;idered that perhaps death it&s;elf, when it &s;hould come, would excite le&s;s horrour than &s;eems now to attend it.</P>
<P>In order to rouze the vocal organs, I took two drams. Wine has been celebrated for the production of eloquence. I put my&s;elf into violent motion, and I think repeated it; but all was vain. I then went to bed, and, &s;trange as it may &s;eem, I think, &s;lept. When I &s;aw light, it was time to contrive
<PB N="460" REF="462" MS="y">
 what I &s;hould do. Though GOD &s;topped my &s;peech, he left me my hand, I enjoyed a mercy which was not granted to my dear friend Lawrence, who now perhaps overlooks me as I am writing, and rejoices that I have what he wanted. My fir&s;t note was nece&s;&s;arily to my &s;ervant, who came in talking, and could not immediately comprehend why he &s;hould read what I put into his hands.</P>
<P>I then wrote a card to Mr. Allen, that I might have a di&s;creet friend at hand, to act as occa&s;ion &s;hould require. In penning this note, I had &s;ome difficulty; my hand, I knew not how nor why, made wrong letters. I then wrote to Dr. Taylor to come to me, and bring Dr. Heberden; and I &s;ent to Dr. Brockle&s;by, who is my neighbour. My phy&s;icians are very friendly and give me great hopes; but you may imagine my &s;ituation. I have &s;o far recovered my vocal powers, as to repeat the Lord's Prayer with no very imper|fect articulation.

<P>YOUR anxiety about my health is very friendly, and very agree|able with your general kindne&s;s. I have, indeed, had a very frightful blow. On the 17th of la&s;t month, about three in the morning, as near as I can gue&s;s, I perceived my&s;elf almo&s;t totally deprived of &s;peech. I had no pain.

Though for &s;everal years her temper had not been complacent, &s;he had valuable quali|ties, and her departure left a blank in his hou&s;e. Upon this occa&s;ion he, according to his habitual cour&s;e of piety, compo&s;ed a prayer <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 226.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here in&s;ert a few particulars concerning him, with which I have been favoured by one of his friends.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He had once conceived the de&s;ign of writing the Life of Oliver Cromwell, &s;aying, that he thought it mu&s;t be highly curious to trace his extraordinary ri&s;e to the &s;upreme power, from &s;o ob&s;cure a beginning. He at length laid a&s;ide his &s;cheme, on di&s;covering that all that can be told of him is already in print; and that it is impracticable to procure any authentick information in addition to what the world is already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He had likewi&s;e projected, but at what part of his life is not known, a work to &s;hew how &s;mall a quantity of REAL FICTION there is in the world; and how the &s;ame images, with very little variation, have &s;erved all the authours who have ever written."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"His thoughts in the latter part of his life were frequently employed on his decea&s;ed friends. He often muttered the&s;e, or &s;uch like &s;entences, 'Poor man! and then he died."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Speaking of a certain literary friend, 'He is a very pompous puzzling fellow, (&s;ays the Doctor;) he lent me a letter once that &s;omebody had written to him, no matter what it was about; but he wanted to have the letter back, and expre&s;&s;ed a mighty value for it, he hoped it was to be met with again, he would not lo&s;e it for a thou&s;and pounds. I layed my hand upon it &s;oon afterwards, and gave it him. I believe I &s;aid, I was very glad to have met with it. O then he did not know that it &s;ignified any thing. So you &s;ee, when the letter was lo&s;t it was worth a thou&s;and pounds, and when it was found it was not worth a farthing."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="466" MS="y">
 <Q REND="inline">"The &s;tyle and character of his conver&s;ation is pretty generally known; it was certainly conducted in conformity with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> of Lord Bacon, but it is not clear, I apprehend, that this conformity was either perceived or intended by John&s;on. The precept alluded to is as follows: 'In all kinds of &s;peech, either plea&s;ant, grave, &s;evere, or ordinary, it is convenient to &s;peak lei&s;urely, and rather drawingly than ha&s;tily: becau&s;e ha&s;ty &s;peech confounds the memory, and oftentimes, be&s;ides the un&s;eemline&s;s, drives a man either to &s;tammering, a non-plus, or harping on that which &s;hould fol|low; whereas a &s;low &s;peech confirmeth the memory, addeth a conceit of wi&s;dom to the hearers, be&s;ides a &s;eemline&s;s of &s;peech and countenance.' Dr. John&s;on's method of conver&s;ation was certainly calculated to excite attention, and to amufe or in&s;truct, (as it happened,) without wearying or confu&s;ing his company. He was always mo&s;t perfectly clear and con&s;picuous; and his language was &s;o accurate, and his &s;entences &s;o neatly con&s;tructed, that his con|ver&s;ation might have been all printed without any correction. At the &s;ame time, it was ea&s;y and natural; the accuracy of it had no appearance of labour, con&s;traint, or &s;tiffne&s;s; he &s;eemed more correct than others by the force of habit and the cu&s;tomary exerci&s;es of his powerful mind."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He &s;poke often in prai&s;e of French literature. 'The French are excellent in this, (he would &s;ay,) they have a book on every &s;ubject.' From what he had &s;een of them he denied them the prai&s;e of &s;uperiour politene&s;s, and mentioned, with very vi&s;ible di&s;gu&s;t, the cu&s;tom they have of &s;pitting on the floors of their apartment. 'This (&s;ays the Doctor) is as gro&s;s a thing as can well be done; and one wonders how any man, or &s;et of men, can per&s;i&s;t in &s;o offen&s;ive a practice for a whole day together; one &s;hould expect that the fir&s;t effort toward civilization would remove it even among&s;t &s;avages."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Baxter's 'Rea&s;ons of the Chri&s;tian Religion,' he thought contained the be&s;t collection of the evidences of the divinity of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Chymi&s;try was always an intere&s;ting pur&s;uit with Dr. John&s;on. Whil&s;t he was in Wilt&s;hire, he attended &s;ome experiments that were made by a phy&s;ician at Sali&s;bury, on the new kinds of air. In the cour&s;e of the experi|ments frequent mention being made of Dr. Prie&s;tley, Dr. John&s;on knit his brows, and in a &s;tern manner enquired, 'Why do we hear &s;o much of Dr. Prie&s;tley <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">I do not wonder at John&s;on's di&s;plea&s;ure when the name of Dr. Prie&s;tley was mentioned; for I know no writer who has been &s;uffered to publi&s;h more pernicious doctrines. I &s;hall in&s;tance only three. Fir&s;t, <HI>Materiali&s;m;</HI> by which <HI>mind</HI> is denied to human nature, which, if believed, mu&s;t deprive us of every elevated principle. Secondly, <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity;</HI> or the doctrine that every action, whether good or bad, is included in an unchangeable and unavoidable &s;y&s;tem; a notion utterly &s;ubver&s;ive of moral government. Thirdly, that we have no rea&s;on to think that the <HI>future</HI> world, (which, as he is plea&s;ed to <HI>inform</HI> us, will be adapted to our merely improved nature,) will be materially different from <HI>this;</HI> which, if believed, would &s;ink wretched mortals into de&s;pair, as they could no longer hope for the <Q REND="inline">"re&s;t that remaineth for the people of GOD,"</Q> or for that hap|pine&s;s which is revealed to us as &s;omething beyond our pre&s;ent conceptions; but would &s;eel them|&s;elves doomed to a continuation of the unea&s;y &s;tate under which they now groan. I &s;ay nothing of the petulant intemperance with which he dares to in&s;ult the venerable e&s;tabli&s;hments of his country.</NOTE>?' He was very properly an&s;wered, 'Sir, becau&s;e we are indebted
<PB N="465" REF="467" MS="y">
to him for the&s;e important di&s;coveries.' On this, Dr. John&s;on appeared well  content; and replied, 'Well, well, I believe we are; and let every man have the honour he has merited."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A friend was one day, about two years before his death, &s;truck with &s;ome in&s;tance of Dr. John&s;on's great candour. 'Well, Sir, (&s;aid he,) I will always &s;ay that you are a very candid man.'&mdash;'Will you (replied the Doctor) I doubt then you will be very &s;ingular. But, indeed, Sir, (continued he,) I look upon my&s;elf to be a man very much mi&s;under&s;tood. I am not an uncandid, nor am I a &s;evere man. I &s;ometimes &s;ay more than I mean in je&s;t, and people are apt to believe me &s;erious: however, I am more candid than I was when I was younger. As I know more of mankind I expect le&s;s of them, and am ready now to call a man <HI>a good man,</HI> upon ea&s;ier terms than I was formerly."</Q></P>
<P>On his return from Heale he wrote to Dr. Burney. <Q REND="inline">"I came home on the 18th at noon to a very di&s;con&s;olate hou&s;e. You and I have lo&s;t our friends, but you have more friends at home. My dome&s;tick companion is taken from me. She is much mi&s;&s;ed, for her acqui&s;itions were many, and her curio&s;ity univer&s;al; &s;o that &s;he partook of every conver&s;ation. I am not well enough to go much out; and to &s;it, and eat, or fa&s;t alone, is very weari&s;ome. I always mean to &s;end my compliments to all the ladies."</Q></P>
<P>His fortitude and patience met with &s;evere trials during this year. The &s;troke of the pal&s;y has been related circum&s;tantially; but he was al&s;o afflicted with the gout, and was be&s;ides troubled with a complaint which not only was attended with immediate inconvenience, but threatened him with a painful chirurgical operation, from which mo&s;t men would &s;hrink. The complaint was a <HI>&s;arcocele,</HI> which John&s;on bore with uncommon firmne&s;s, and was not at all frightened while he looked forward to amputation. He was attended by Mr. Pott and al&s;o Mr. Cruik&s;hank. I have before me a letter of the 30th of July this year, to Mr. Cruik&s;hank, in which he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"I am going to put my&s;elf into your hands;"</Q> and another, accompanying a &s;et of his <Q REND="inline">"Lives of
<PB N="466" REF="468" MS="y">
 the Poets,"</Q> in which he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"I beg your acceptance of the&s;e volumes, as an acknowledgement of the great favours which you have be&s;towed on, Sir, your mo&s;t obliged and mo&s;t humble &s;ervant."</Q> I have in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;everal more letters from him to Mr. Cruik&s;hank, and al&s;o to Dr. Mudge at Plymouth, which it would be improper to in&s;ert, as they are filled with unplea&s;ing technical details. I &s;hall, however, extract from his letters to Dr. Mudge &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as &s;hew either a felicity of expre&s;&s;ion, or the undaunted &s;tate of his mind.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My conviction of your &s;kill, and my belief of your friend&s;hip, determine me to intreat your opinion and advice."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"In this &s;tate I with great earne&s;t|ne&s;s de&s;ire you to tell me what is to be done. Exci&s;ion is doubtle&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to the cure, and I know not any means of palliation. The operation is doubtle&s;s painful; but is it dangerous? The pain I hope to endure with decency; but I am loth to put life into much hazard."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"By repre&s;enting the gout as an antagoni&s;t to the pal&s;y, you have &s;aid enough to make it welcome. This is not &s;trictly the fir&s;t fit, but I hope it is as good as the fir&s;t; for it is the &s;econd that ever confined me; and the fir&s;t was ten years ago, much le&s;s fierce and fiery than this."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Write, dear Sir, what you can, to inform or encourage me. The operation is not delayed by any fears or objections of mine."</Q></P>
<P>Happily the complaint abated without his being put to the torture of amputation. But we mu&s;t &s;urely admire the manly re&s;olution which he di&s;covered while it hung over him.</P>

<P>YOU may very rea&s;onably charge me with in&s;en&s;ibility of your kindne&s;s, and that of Lady Rothes, &s;ince I have &s;uffered &s;o much time to pa&s;s without paying any acknowledgement.

In his next letter to the &s;ame gentleman he writes, <Q REND="inline">"The gout has within  the&s;e four days come upon me with a violence which I never experienced before. It made me helple&s;s as an infant."</Q>&mdash;And in the following, having mentioned Mrs. Williams, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Who&s;e death following that of Levett, has now made my hou&s;e a &s;olitude. She left her little &s;ub&s;tance to a charity|&s;chool. She is, I hope, where there is neither darkne&s;s, nor want, nor &s;orrow."</Q></P>
<P>I wrote to him, begging to know the &s;tate of his health, and mentioned that <Q REND="inline">"Baxter's Anacreon, which is in the library at Auchinleck, was, I find, collated by my father in 1727, with the M. S. belonging to the Univer&s;ity of Leyden, and he has made a number of Notes upon it. Would you advi&s;e me to publi&s;h a new edition of it?"</Q></P>
<P>His an&s;wer was dated September 30.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You &s;hould not make your letters &s;uch rarities, when you know, or might know, the uniform &s;tate of my health. It is very long &s;ince I heard from you; and that I have not an&s;wered is a very in&s;ufficient rea&s;on for the &s;ilence of a friend.&mdash;Your Anacreon is a very uncommon book; neither London nor Cambridge can &s;upply a copy of that edition. Whether it &s;hould be reprinted, you cannot do better than con|&s;ult Lord Hailes.&mdash;Be&s;ides my con&s;tant and radical di&s;ea&s;e, I have been for the&s;e ten days much harra&s;&s;ed with the gout, but that has now remitted. I hope GOD will yet grant me a little longer life, and make me le&s;s unfit to appear before him."</Q></P>
<P>He this autumn received a vi&s;it from the celebrated Mrs. Siddons. He gives this account of it in one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Siddons, in her vi&s;it to me, behaved with great mode&s;ty and propriety, and left nothing behind her to be cen&s;ured or de&s;pi&s;ed. Neither prai&s;e nor money, the two powerful corrupters of mankind, &s;eem to have depraved her. I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee her again. Her brother Kemble calls on me, and plea&s;es me very well. Mrs. Siddons and I talked of plays; and &s;he told me her intention of exhibit|ing this winter the characters of Con&s;tance, Catherine, and I&s;abella, in Shak&s;peare."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Kemble has favoured me with the following minute of what pa&s;&s;ed at this vi&s;it.</P>
<Q><P>When Mrs. Siddons came into the room, there happened to be no chair ready for her, which he ob&s;erving, &s;aid with a &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">'Madam, you who &s;o often occa&s;ion a want of &s;eats to other people, will the more ea&s;ily excu&s;e the want of one your&s;elf.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="470" MS="y">
 Having placed him&s;elf by her, he with great good humour entered upon a con&s;ideration of the Engli&s;h drama; and, among other enquiries, particu|larly a&s;ked her which of Shak&s;peare's characters &s;he was mo&s;t plea&s;ed with. Upon her an&s;wering that &s;he thought the character of Queen Catherine in Henry the Eighth the mo&s;t natural. <Q REND="inline">'I think &s;o too, Madam, (&s;aid he;) and whenever you perform it I will once more hobble out to the theatre my&s;elf.'</Q> Mrs. Siddons promi&s;ed &s;he would do her&s;elf the honour of acting his favourite part for him; but many circum&s;tances happened to prevent the repre&s;entation of King Henry the Eighth during the Doctor's life.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the evening he thus gave his opinion upon the merits of &s;ome of the principal performers whom he remembered to have &s;een upon the &s;tage. <Q REND="inline">'Mrs. Porter, in the vehemence of rage, and Mrs. Clive in the &s;prightline&s;s of humour, I have never &s;een equalled. What Clive did be&s;t, &s;he did better than Garrick; but could not do half &s;o many things well; &s;he was a better romp than any I ever &s;aw in nature. Pritchard, in common life, was a vulgar ideot; &s;he would talk of her <HI>gownd:</HI> but, when &s;he appeared upon the &s;tage, &s;eemed to be in&s;pired by gentility and under&s;tanding. I once talked with Colley Cibber, and thought him ignorant of the principles of his art. Garrick, Madam, was no declaimer; there was not one of his own &s;cene-&s;hifters who could not have &s;poken <HI>To be, or not to be,</HI> better than he did; yet he was the only actor I ever &s;aw whom I could call a ma&s;ter both in tragedy and comedy; though I liked him be&s;t in comedy. A true con|ception of character, and natural expre&s;&s;ion of it were his di&s;tingui&s;hing excellencies.'</Q> Having expatiated, with his u&s;ual force and eloquence, on Mr. Garrick's extraordinary eminence as an actor, he concluded with this compliment to his &s;ocial talents: <Q REND="inline">'And after all, Madam, I thought him le&s;s to be envied on the &s;tage than at the head of a table.</Q></P></Q>
<P>John&s;on, indeed, had thought more upon the &s;ubject of acting than might be generally &s;uppo&s;ed. Talking of it one day to Mr. Kemble, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Are you, Sir, one of tho&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;ts who believe your&s;elf transformed into the very character you repre&s;ent."</Q> Upon Mr. Kemble's an&s;wering that he had never felt &s;o &s;trong a per&s;ua&s;ion him&s;elf; <Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure not, Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on). The thing is impo&s;&s;ible. And if Garrick really believed him&s;elf to be that mon&s;ter Richard the Third, he de&s;erved to be hanged every time he per|formed it."</Q></P>
<P>A plea&s;ing in&s;tance of the generous attention of one of his friends has been di&s;covered by the publication of Mrs. Thrale's collection of Letters. In a
<PB N="469" REF="471">
letter to one of the Mi&s;s Thrales <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 328.</NOTE>, he writes, <Q REND="inline">"A friend, who&s;e name I will  tell when your mamma has tried to gue&s;s it, &s;ent to my phy&s;ician to enquire whether this long train of illne&s;s had brought me into difficulties for want of money, with an invitation to &s;end to him for what occa&s;ion required. I &s;hall write this night to thank him, having no need to borrow."</Q> And after|wards, in a letter to Mrs. Thrale, <Q REND="inline">"Since you cannot gue&s;s, I will tell you, that the generous man was Gerard Hamilton. I returned him a very thank|ful and re&s;pectful letter <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 342.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>I applied to Mr. Hamilton, by a common friend, and he has been &s;o obliging as to let me have John&s;on's letter to him upon this occa&s;ion, to adorn my collection.</P>

<P>I find in this, as in former years, notices of his kind attention to Mrs. Gardiner, who, though in the humble &s;tation of a tallow-chandler upon Snow-hill, was a woman of excellent good &s;en&s;e, pious, and charitable. She told me, &s;he had been introduced to him by Mrs. Ma&s;ters the poete&s;s, who&s;e volumes he revi&s;ed, and, it is &s;aid, illuminated here and there with a ray of his own genius. Mrs. Gardiner was very zealous for the &s;upport of a Welch charity-&s;chool; and John&s;on this year, I find, obtained for it a &s;ermon from the late Bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, Dr. Shipley, whom he, in one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale, characteri&s;es as <Q REND="inline">"knowing and conver&s;ible;"</Q> and whom all who knew his Lord&s;hip, even tho&s;e who differed from him in poli|ticks, remember with much re&s;pect.</P>

 The Earl of Carli&s;le having written a tragedy entitled <Q REND="inline">"THE FATHER'S REVENGE,"</Q> &s;ome of his Lord&s;hip's friends applied to Mrs. Chapone, to prevail on Dr. John&s;on to read and give his opinion of it, which he accord|ingly did, in a letter to that lady.

His Lord&s;hip was &s;o good as to comply with my reque&s;t, and has thus enabled me to enrich my work with a very fine piece of writing, which di&s;plays at once the critical &s;kill and politene&s;s of my illu&s;trious friend; and perhaps the curio&s;ity which it will excite, may induce the noble and elegant authour to gratify the world by the publication<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">A few copies only of this tragedy have been printed, and given to the authour's friends.</NOTE> of a performance, of which Dr. John&s;on has &s;poken in &s;uch terms.</P>

<P>BY &s;ending the tragedy to me a &s;econd time <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Dr. John&s;on, having been very ill when the tragedy was fir&s;t &s;ent to him, had declined the con&s;ideration of it.</NOTE>, I think that a very honourable di&s;tinction has been &s;hewn me, and I did not delay the peru&s;al, of which I am now to tell the effect.</P>
<P>The con&s;truction of the play is not completely regular; the &s;tage is too often vacant, and the &s;cenes are not &s;ufficiently connected. This, however, would be called by Dryden only a mechanical defect; which takes away little from the power of the poem, and which is &s;een rather than felt.</P>
<P>A rigid examiner of the diction might, perhaps, wi&s;h &s;ome words changed, and &s;ome lines more vigorou&s;ly terminated. But from &s;uch petty imperfections what writer was ever free?</P>
<P>The general form and force of the dialogue is of more importance. It &s;eems to want that quickne&s;s of reciprocation which characteri&s;es the Engli&s;h drama, and is not always &s;ufficiently fervid or animated.</P>
<P>Of the &s;entiments, I remember not one that I wi&s;hed omitted. In the imagery I cannot forbear to di&s;tingui&s;h the compari&s;on of joy &s;ucceeding grief

<P>The cata&s;trophe is affecting. The Father and Daughter both culpable, both wretched, and both penitent, divide between them our pity and our &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Thus, Madam, I have performed what I did not willingly undertake, and could not decently refu&s;e. The noble writer will be plea&s;ed to remem|ber, that &s;incere critici&s;m ought to rai&s;e no re&s;entment, becau&s;e judgement is not under the controul of will; but involuntary critici&s;m, as it has &s;till le&s;s of choice, ought to be more remote from po&s;&s;ibility of offence.</P>

<P>I con&s;ulted him on two que&s;tions, of a very different nature: one, whether the uncon&s;titutional influence exerci&s;ed by the Peers of Scotland in the election of the repre&s;entatives of the Commons, by means of fictitious qualifications, ought not to be re&s;i&s;ted?&mdash;the other, What, in propriety and humanity, &s;hould be done with old hor&s;es unable to labour?

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LIKE all other men who have great friends, you begin to feel the pangs of neglected merit, and all the comfort that I can give you is, by telling you that you have probably more pangs to feel, and more neglect to &s;uffer. You have, indeed, begun to complain too &s;oon; and I hope I am the only confidant of your di&s;content. Your friends have not yet had lei&s;ure
<PB N="472" REF="474">
 to gratify per&s;onal kindne&s;s; they have hitherto been bu&s;y in &s;trengthening their mini&s;terial intere&s;t. If a vacancy happens in Scotland, give them early intelligence; and as you can &s;erve Government as powerfully as any of your probable competitors, you may make in &s;ome &s;ort a warrantable claim.</P>
<P>Of the exaltations and depre&s;&s;ions of your mind you delight to talk, and I hate to hear. Drive all &s;uch fancies from you.</P>
<P>On the day when I received your letter, I think, the foregoing page was written; to which, one di&s;ea&s;e or another has hindered me from making any additions. I am now a little better. But &s;ickne&s;s and &s;olitude pre&s;s me very heavily. I could bear &s;ickne&s;s better, if I were relieved from &s;olitude.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent dreadful confu&s;ion of the publick ought to make you wrap your&s;elf up in your hereditary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which, though le&s;s than you may wi&s;h, are more than you can want; and in an hour of religious retirement return thanks to GOD, who has exempted you from any &s;trong temptation to faction, treachery, plunder, and di&s;loyalty.</P>
<P>As your neighbours di&s;tingui&s;h you by &s;uch honours as they can be&s;tow, content your&s;elf with your &s;tation, without neglecting your profe&s;&s;ion. Your e&s;tate and the Courts will find you full employment; and your mind well occupied will be quiet.</P>
<P>The u&s;urpation of the nobility, for they apparently u&s;urp all the influence they gain by fraud, and mi&s;repre&s;entation, I think it certainly lawful, perhaps your duty to re&s;i&s;t. What is not their own they have only by robbery.</P>
<P>Your que&s;tion about the hor&s;es gives me more perplexity. I know not well what advice to give you. I can only recommend a rule which you do not want&mdash;give as little pain as you can. I &s;uppo&s;e that we have a right to their &s;ervice while their &s;trength la&s;ts; what we can do with them afterwards I cannot &s;o ea&s;ily determine. But let us con&s;ider. Nobody denies that man has a right fir&s;t to milk the cow, and to &s;heer the &s;heep, and then to kill them for his table. May he not, by parity of rea&s;on, fir&s;t work a hor&s;e, and then kill him the ea&s;ie&s;t way, that he may have the means of another hor&s;e, or food for cows and &s;heep? Man is influenced in both ca&s;es by different motives of &s;elf-intere&s;t. He that rejects the one mu&s;t reject the other.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="473" REF="475" MS="y">
The late ingenious Mr. Mickle, &s;ome time before his death, wrote me a  letter concerning Dr. John&s;on, in which he mentions, <Q REND="inline">"I was upwards of twelve years acquainted with him, was frequently in his company, always talked with ea&s;e to him, and can truly &s;ay, that I never received from him one rough word."</Q></P>
<P>In this letter he relates his having, while engaged in tran&s;lating the Lu&s;iad, had a di&s;pute of con&s;iderable length with John&s;on, who, as, u&s;ual declaimed upon the mi&s;ery and corruption of a &s;ea life, and u&s;ed this expre&s;&s;ion:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It had been happy for the world, Sir, if your hero Gama, Prince Henry of Portugal, and Columbus, had never been born, or that their &s;chemes had never gone farther than their own imaginations."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"This &s;entiment, (&s;ays Mr. Mickle,) which is to be found in his 'Introduction to the World di&s;played,' I, in my Di&s;&s;ertation prefixed to the Lu&s;iad, have controverted; and though authours are &s;aid to be bad judges of their own works, I am not a&s;hamed to own to a friend, that that di&s;&s;ertation is my favourite above all that I ever attempted in pro&s;e. Next year, when the Lu&s;iad was publi&s;hed, I waited on Dr. John&s;on, who addre&s;&s;ed me with one of his good-humoured &s;miles:&mdash;'Well, you have remembered our di&s;pute about Prince Henry, and have cited me too. You have done your part very well indeed; you have made the be&s;t of your argument: but I am not convinced yet.'</Q></P>
<Q><P>Before publi&s;hing the Lu&s;iad, I &s;ent Mr. Hoole a proof of that part of the introduction, in which I make mention of Dr. John&s;on, your&s;elf, and other well|wi&s;hers to the work, begging it might be &s;hewn to Dr. John&s;on. This was accordingly done; and in place of the &s;imple mention of him which I had made, he dictated to Mr. Hoole the &s;entence as it now &s;tands.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on told me in 1772, that about twenty years before that time, he him&s;elf had a de&s;ign to tran&s;late the Lu&s;iad, of the merit of which he &s;poke highly, but had been prevented by a number of other engagements.</P></Q>
<P>Mr. Mickle reminds me in this letter of a conver&s;ation, when dining one day at Mr. Hoole's with Dr. John&s;on, when Mr. Nicol, the King's book|&s;eller, and I attempted to controvert the maxim, <Q REND="inline">"Better that ten guilty &s;hould e&s;cape, than one innocent per&s;on &s;uffer;"</Q> and were an&s;wered by Dr. John&s;on with great power of rea&s;oning and eloquence. I am very &s;orry that I have no record of that day; but I well recollect my illu&s;trious friend's having ably &s;hewn, that unle&s;s civil in&s;titutions in&s;ure protection to the inno|cent, all the confidence which mankind &s;hould have in them would be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here mention what &s;hould properly have appeared in my account of la&s;t year, though the controver&s;y was not clo&s;ed till this. The Reverend
<PB N="474" REF="476">
 Mr. Shaw, a native of one of the Hebrides, having entertained doubts of the authenticity of the poems a&s;cribed to O&s;&s;ian, dive&s;ted him&s;elf of national bigotry; and having travelled in the Highlands and I&s;lands of Scotland, and al&s;o in Ireland, in order to furni&s;h him&s;elf with materials for a Gaelick Dictionary, which he afterwards compiled, was &s;o fully &s;atisfied that Dr. John&s;on was in the right upon the que&s;tion, that he fairly publi&s;hed a pam|phlet, &s;tating his conviction, and the proofs and rea&s;ons on which it was founded. A per&s;on at Edinburgh, of the name of Clark, an&s;wered this pamphlet with much zeal, and much abu&s;e of its authour. John&s;on took Mr. Shaw under his protection, and gave him his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in writing a reply, which has been admired by the be&s;t judges, and by many been con&s;idered as conclu&s;ive. A few paragraphs, which &s;ufficiently mark their great authour, &s;hall be &s;elected.</P>
<Q><P>My a&s;&s;ertions are, for the mo&s;t part, purely negative: I deny the exi&s;tence of Fingal, becau&s;e in a long and curious peregrination through the Gaelick regions I have never been able to find it. What I could not &s;ee my&s;elf I &s;u&s;pect to be equally invi&s;ible to others; and I &s;u&s;pect with the more rea&s;on, as among all tho&s;e who have &s;een it no man can &s;hew it.</P>
<P>Mr. Clark compares the ob&s;tinacy of tho&s;e who di&s;believe the genuine|ne&s;s of O&s;&s;ian to a blind man, who &s;hould di&s;pute the reality of colours, and deny that the Briti&s;h troops are cloathed in red. The blind man's doubt would be rational, if he did not know by experience that others have a power which he him&s;elf wants: but what per&s;picacity has Mr. Clark which Nature has with-held from me or the re&s;t of mankind?</P>
<P>The true &s;tate of the parallel mu&s;t be this. Suppo&s;e a man, with eyes like his neighbours, was told by a boa&s;ting corporal, that the troops, indeed, wore red clothes for their ordinary dre&s;s, but that every &s;oldier had likewi&s;e a &s;uit of black velvet, which he put on when the King reviews them. This he thinks &s;trange, and de&s;ires to &s;ee the fine clothes, but finds nobody in forty thou&s;and men that can produce either coat or wai&s;tcoat. One, indeed, has left them in his che&s;t at Port Mahon; another has always heard that he ought to have velvet clothes &s;omewhere; and a third has heard &s;omebody &s;ay, that &s;oldiers ought to wear velvet. Can the enquirer be blamed if he goes away believing that a &s;oldier's red coat is all that he has?</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t obdurate incredulity may be &s;hamed or &s;ilenced by facts. To overpower contradictions, let the &s;oldier &s;hew his velvet coat, and the Fingali&s;t the original of O&s;&s;ian.</P>
<P><PB N="475" REF="477">
The difference between us and the blind man is this:&mdash;the blind man is  unconvinced, becau&s;e he cannot &s;ee; and we, becau&s;e though we can &s;ee, we find that nothing can be &s;hown.</P></Q>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the complication of di&s;orders under which John&s;on now laboured, he did not re&s;ign him&s;elf to de&s;pondency and di&s;content, but with wi&s;dom and &s;pirit endeavoured to con&s;ole and amu&s;e his mind with as many innocent enjoyments as he could procure. Sir John Hawkins has mentioned the cordiality with which he in&s;i&s;ted that &s;uch of the members of the old club in Ivy-lane as &s;urvived &s;hould meet again and dine together, which they did, twice at a tavern, and once at his hou&s;e: and in order to in&s;ure him&s;elf &s;ociety in the evening for three days in the week, he in&s;tituted a Club at the E&s;&s;ex Head, in E&s;&s;ex-&s;treet, then kept by Samuel Greaves, an old &s;ervant of Mr. Thrale's.</P>

<P>Having promoted the in&s;titution of a new Club in the neighbourhood, at the hou&s;e of an old &s;ervant of Thrale's, I went thither to meet the com|pany, and was &s;eized with a &s;pa&s;modick a&s;thma &s;o violent, that with difficulty
<PB N="479" REF="481" MS="y">
I got to my own hou&s;e, in which I have been confined eight or nine weeks,  and from which I know not when I &s;hall be able to go even to church. The a&s;thma, however, is not the wor&s;t. A drop&s;y gains ground upon me; my legs and thighs are very much &s;wollen with water, which I &s;hould be content if I could keep there, but I am afraid that it will &s;oon be higher. My nights are very &s;leeple&s;s and very tedious. And yet I am extremely afraid of dying.</P>
<P>My phy&s;icians try to make me hope, that much of my malady is the effect of cold, and that &s;ome degree at lea&s;t of recovery is to be expected from vernal breezes and &s;ummer &s;uns. If my life is prolonged to autumn, I &s;hould be glad to try a warmer climate; though how to travel with a di&s;ea&s;ed body, without a companion to conduct me, and with very little money, I do not well &s;ee. Ram&s;ay has recovered his limbs in Italy; and Fielding was &s;ent to Li&s;bon, where, indeed, he died; but he was, I believe, pa&s;t hope when he went. Think for me what I can do.</P>

I am very much of your opinion, and, like you, feel great indignation at the indecency with which the King is every day treated. Your paper contains very con&s;iderable knowledge of the hi&s;tory and of the con&s;ti|tution, very properly produced and applied. It will certainly rai&s;e your character <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">I &s;ent it to Mr. Pitt, with a letter, in which I thus expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf: <Q REND="inline">"My principles may appear to you too monarchical; but I know and am per&s;uaded, they are not incon&s;i&s;tent with the true principles of liberty.

<P>PRESENTLY after I had &s;ent away my la&s;t letter, I received your kind medical packet. I am very much obliged both to you and your phy&s;icians for your kind attention to my di&s;ea&s;e.

<P>I al&s;o applied to three of the eminent phy&s;icians who had chairs in our celebrated &s;chool of medicine at Edinburgh, Doctors Cullen, Hope, and Monro, to each of whom I &s;ent the following letter:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DR. JOHNSON has been very ill for &s;ome time; and in a letter of anxious apprehen&s;ion he writes to me, <Q REND="inline">'A&s;k your phy&s;icians about my ca&s;e.'</Q></P>
<P>This, you &s;ee, is not authority for a regular con&s;ultation: but I have no doubt of your readine&s;s to give your advice to a man &s;o eminent, and who, in his Life of Garth, has paid your profe&s;&s;ion a ju&s;t and elegant com|pliment: <Q REND="inline">'I believe every man has found in phy&s;icians great liberality and dignity of &s;entiment, very prompt effu&s;ions of beneficence, and willingne&s;s to exert a lucrative art, where there is no hope of lucre.'</Q></P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on is aged &s;eventy-four. La&s;t &s;ummer he had a &s;troke of the pal&s;y, from which he recovered almo&s;t entirely. He had, before that, been
<PB N="482" REF="484">
 troubled with a catarrhous cough. This winter he was &s;eized with a &s;pa&s;|modick a&s;thma, by which he has been confined to his hou&s;e for about three months. Dr. Brockle&s;by writes to me, that upon the lea&s;t admi&s;&s;ion of cold, there is &s;uch a con&s;triction upon his brea&s;t, that he cannot lye down in his bed, but is obliged to &s;it up all night, and gets re&s;t, and &s;ometimes &s;leep, only by means of laudanum and &s;yrup of poppies; and that there are oedematous tumours on his legs and thighs. Dr. Brockle&s;by tru&s;ts a good deal to the return of mild weather. Dr. John&s;on &s;ays, that a drop&s;y gains ground upon him; and he &s;eems to think that a warmer climate would do him good. I under&s;tand he is now rather better, and is u&s;ing vinegar of &s;quills.</P>

<P>All of them paid the mo&s;t polite attention to my letter, and its&mdash;venerable object. Dr. Cullen's words concerning him were, <Q REND="inline">"It would give me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure to be of any &s;ervice to a man whom the publick properly e&s;teem, and whom I e&s;teem and re&s;pect as much as I do Dr. John&s;on."</Q> Dr. Hope's, <Q REND="inline">"Few people have a better claim on me than your friend, as hardly a day pa&s;&s;es that I do not a&s;k his opinion about this or that word."</Q> Dr. Monro's, <Q REND="inline">"I mo&s;t &s;incerely join you in &s;ympathizing with that very worthy and ingenious character, from whom his country has derived much in&s;truction and entertainment."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Hope corre&s;ponded with his friend Dr. Brockle&s;by. Doctors Cullen and Monro wrote their opinions and pre&s;criptions to me, which I afterwards carried with me to London, and, &s;o far as they were encouraging, communi|cated to John&s;on.

by cold, gives me little trouble. While I am writing this, I have not any &s;en|&s;ation  of debility or di&s;ea&s;e. But I do not yet venture out, having been confined to the hou&s;e from the thirteenth of December, now a quarter of a year.</P>
<P>When it will be fit for me to travel as far as Auchinleck, I am not able to gue&s;s; but &s;uch a letter as Mrs. Bo&s;well's might draw any man, not wholly motionle&s;s, a great way. Pray tell the dear lady how much her civility and kindne&s;s have touched and gratified me.</P>
<P>Our parliamentary tumults have now begun to &s;ub&s;ide, and the King's authority is in &s;ome mea&s;ure re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. Mr. Pitt will have great power; but you mu&s;t remember, that what he has to give mu&s;t, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time, be given to tho&s;e who gave, and tho&s;e who pre&s;erve his power.

<P>I wrote to him, March 28, from York, informing him that I had a high gratification in the triumph of monarchical principles over ari&s;tocratical influence, in that great county, in an addre&s;s to the King; that I was thus far on my way to him, but that news of the di&s;&s;olution of Parliament having arrived, I was to ha&s;ten back to my own country, where I had carried an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty by a great majority, and had &s;ome intention of being a candidate to repre&s;ent the county in Parliament.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU could do nothing &s;o proper as to ha&s;te back when you found the Parliament di&s;&s;olved. With the influence which your addre&s;s mu&s;t
<PB N="484" REF="486" MS="y">
 have gained you, it may rea&s;onably be expected that your pre&s;ence will be of importance, and your activity of effect.</P>
<P>Your &s;olicitude for me gives me that plea&s;ure which every man feels from the kindne&s;s of &s;uch a friend; and it is with delight I relieve it by telling that Dr. Brockle&s;by's account is true, and that I am, by the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, wonderfully relieved.</P>
<P>You are entering upon a tran&s;action which requires much prudence. You mu&s;t endeavour to oppo&s;e without exa&s;perating; to practi&s;e temporary ho&s;tility, without producing enemies for life. This is, perhaps, hard to be done; yet it has been done by many, and &s;eems mo&s;t likely to be effected by oppo&s;ing merely upon general principles, without de&s;cending to per&s;onal or particular cen&s;ures or objections. One thing I mu&s;t enjoin you, which is &s;eldom ob&s;erved in the conduct of elections;&mdash;I mu&s;t entreat you to be &s;crupulous in the u&s;e of &s;trong liquors. One night's drunkenne&s;s may defeat the labours of forty days well employed. Be firm, but not clamorous; be active, but not malicious; and you may form &s;uch an intere&s;t, as may not only exalt your&s;elf, but dignify your family.</P>
<P>We are, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, all bu&s;y here. Mr. Fox re&s;olutely &s;tands for We&s;tmin&s;ter, and his friends &s;ay will carry the election. However that be, he will certainly have a &s;eat. Mr. Hoole has ju&s;t told me, that the city leans towards the King.</P>

<P>To Mr. Langton he wrote with that cordiality which was &s;uitable to the long friend&s;hip which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and that gentleman.</P>
<Q><P>March 27. Since you left me, I have continued in my own opinion, and in Dr. Brockle&s;by's, to grow better with re&s;pect to all my formidable and dangerous di&s;tempers; though to a body battered and &s;haken as mine has lately been, it is to be feared that weak attacks may be &s;ometimes mi&s;|chievous. I have, indeed, by &s;tanding carele&s;sly at an open window, got a very trouble&s;ome cough, which it has been nece&s;&s;ary to appea&s;e by opium, in larger quantities than I like to take, and I have not found it give way &s;o readily as I expected; its ob&s;tinacy, however, &s;eems at la&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the remedy, and I know not whether I &s;hould then have a right to com|plain of any morbid &s;en&s;ation. My a&s;thma is, I am afraid, con&s;titutional
<PB N="485" REF="487" MS="y">
and incurable; but it is only occa&s;ional, and unle&s;s it be excited by labour or  by cold, gives me no mole&s;tation, nor does it lay very clo&s;e &s;iege to life; for Sir John Floyer, whom the phy&s;ical race con&s;ider as authour of one of the be&s;t books upon it, panted on to ninety, as was &s;uppo&s;ed; and why were we content with &s;uppo&s;ing a fact &s;o intere&s;ting, of a man &s;o con&s;picuous, becau&s;e he corrupted, at perhaps &s;eventy or eighty, the regi&s;ter, that he might pa&s;s for younger than he was? He was not much le&s;s than eighty, when to a man of rank who mode&s;tly a&s;ked him his age, he an&s;wered, 'Go look;' though he was in general a man of civility and elegance.</P>
<P>The ladies, I find, are at your hou&s;e all well, except Mi&s;s Langton, who will probably &s;oon recover her health by light &s;uppers. Let her eat at dinner as &s;he will, but not take a full &s;tomach to bed. Pay my &s;incere re&s;pects to the two principal ladies in your hou&s;e; and when you write to dear Mi&s;s Langton in Lincoln&s;hire, let her know that I mean not to break our league of friend&s;hip, and that I have a &s;et of Lives for her, when I have the means of &s;ending it.</P></Q>
<Q><P>April 8. I am &s;till di&s;turbed by my cough; but what thanks have I not to pay, when my cough is the mo&s;t painful &s;en&s;ation that I feel? and from that I expect hardly to be relea&s;ed, while winter continues to gripe us with &s;o much pertinacity. The year has now advanced eighteen days beyond the equinox, and &s;till there is very little remi&s;&s;ion of the cold. When warm weather comes, which &s;urely mu&s;t come at la&s;t, I hope it will help both me and your young lady.</P>
<P>The man &s;o bu&s;y about addre&s;&s;es is neither more nor le&s;s than our own Bo&s;well, who had come as far as York towards London, but turned back on the di&s;&s;olution, and is &s;aid now to &s;tand for &s;ome place. Whether to wi&s;h him &s;ucce&s;s, his be&s;t friends he&s;itate.</P>
<P>Let me have your prayers for the completion of my recovery: I am now better than I ever expected to have been. May GOD add to his mercies the grace that may enable me to u&s;e them according to his will. My com|pliments to all.</P></Q>

<P>One morning afterwards, when I found him alone, he communicated to me, with &s;olemn earne&s;tne&s;s, a very remarkable circum&s;tance which had happened in the cour&s;e of his illne&s;s, when he was much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the drop&s;y. He had &s;hut him&s;elf up, and employed a day in particular exerci&s;es
<PB N="489" REF="491" MS="y">
of religion,&mdash;fa&s;ting, humiliation, and prayer. On a &s;udden he obtained  extraordinary relief, for which he looked up to heaven with grateful devo|tion. He made no direct inference from this fact; but from his manner of telling it, I could perceive that it appeared to him as &s;omething more than an incident in the common cour&s;e of events. For my own part, I have no difficulty to avow that ca&s;t of thinking, which by many modern pretenders to wi&s;dom, is called <HI>&s;uper&s;titious.</HI> But here I think even men of pretty dry rationality may believe, that there was an intermediate interpo&s;ition of divine Providence, and that <Q REND="inline">"the fervent prayer of this righteous man"</Q> availed <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot"><P>Upon this &s;ubject there is a very fair and judicious remark in the Life of Dr. Abernethy, in the fir&s;t edition of the <HI>Biographia Britannica,</HI> which I &s;hould have been glad to &s;ee in his Life which has been written for the &s;econd edition of that valuable work. <Q REND="inline">"To deny the exerci&s;e of a particular providence in the Deity's government of the world is certainly impious: yet nothing &s;erves the cau&s;e of the &s;corner more than an incautious forward zeal in determining the particular in&s;tances of it."</Q></P>
<P>In confirmation of my &s;entiments, I am al&s;o happy to quote that &s;en&s;ible and elegant writer Mr. <HI>Melmoth,</HI> in Letter VIII. of his collection, publi&s;hed under the name of <HI>Fitzo&s;borne.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"We may &s;afely a&s;&s;ert, that the belief of a particular Providence is founded upon &s;uch probable rea&s;ons as may well ju&s;tify our a&s;&s;ent.

<P>On Sunday, May 9, I found Colonel Vallancy, the celebrated antiquarian and engineer of Ireland, with him. On Monday the 10th I dined with him at Mr. Paradi&s;e's, where was a large company; Mr. Bryant, Mr. Joddrel, Mr. Hawkins Browne, &amp;c. On Thur&s;day the 13th I dined with him at Mr. Joddrel's, with another large company; the Bi&s;hop of Exeter, Lord Monboddo <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">I was &s;orry to ob&s;erve Lord Monboddo avoid any communication with Dr. John&s;on. I flattered my&s;elf that I had made them very good friends, (&s;ee <Q REND="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</Q> third edition, page 67,) but unhappily his Lord&s;hip had re&s;umed and cheri&s;hed a violent prejudice again&s;t my illu&s;trious friend, to whom I mu&s;t do the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, there was on his part not the lea&s;t anger, but a good-humoured &s;portivene&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">. Nay, though he knew of his Lord&s;hip's di&s;po&s;ition towards him, he was even kindly; as appeared from his inquiring of me after him, by an abbreviation of his name, <Q REND="inline">"Well, how does <HI>Monny</HI>!"</Q></NOTE>, Mr. Murphy, &amp;c.</P>
<P>On Saturday, May 15, I dined with him at Dr. Brockle&s;by's, where were Colonel Vallancy, Mr. Murphy, and that ever-cheerful companion Mr. Devaynes, apothecary to his Maje&s;ty. Of the&s;e days, and others on which I &s;aw him, I have no memorials, except the general recollection of his being able and animated in conver&s;ation, and appearing to reli&s;h &s;ociety as much as the younge&s;t man.

 I find only the&s;e three &s;mall particulars:&mdash;One, when a per&s;on was mentioned who &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I have lived fifty-one years in this world without having had ten minutes of unea&s;ine&s;s;"</Q> he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"The man who &s;ays &s;o lies. He attempts to impo&s;e on human credulity."</Q> The Bi&s;hop of Exeter in vain ob&s;erved, that men were very different. His Lord&s;hip's manner was not impre&s;&s;ive, and I learnt afterwards that John&s;on did not find out that the per&s;on who talked to him was a Prelate; if he had, I doubt not that he would have treated him with more re&s;pect; for once talking of George P&s;almanazar, whom he reverenced for his piety, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould as &s;oon think of con|tradicting a bi&s;hop."</Q> One of the company provoked him greatly by doing what he could lea&s;t of all bear, which was quoting &s;omething of his own writing, again&s;t what he then maintained. <Q REND="inline">"What, Sir, (cried the gentleman,) do you &s;ay to
<Q><L>'The bu&s;y day, the peaceful night,</L>

John&s;on having thus had him&s;elf pre&s;ented as giving an in&s;tance of a man who had lived without unea&s;ine&s;s was much offended, for he looked upon &s;uch quotation as unfair. His anger bur&s;t out in an unju&s;tifiable retort, in&s;inuating that the gentleman's remark was a &s;ally of ebriety; <Q REND="inline">"Sir, there is one pa&s;&s;ion I would advi&s;e you to command. When you have drunk out that gla&s;s, don't drink another."</Q> Here was exemplified what Gold&s;mith &s;aid of him, with the aid of a very witty image from one of Cibber's Comedies, <Q REND="inline">"There is no arguing with John&s;on; for if his pi&s;tol mi&s;&s;es fire, he knocks you down with the butt end of it."</Q>&mdash;Another, when a gentleman of eminence in the literary world was violently cen&s;ured for attacking people by anonymous paragraphs in news-papers; he, from the &s;pririt of contradiction as I thought, took up his defence, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Come, come, this is not &s;o terrible a crime; he means only to vex them a little. I do not &s;ay that I &s;hould do it; but there is a great difference between him and me; what is fit for Hephae&s;tion is not fit for Alexander."</Q>&mdash;Another, when I told him that a young and hand&s;ome Counte&s;s had &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould think that to be prai&s;ed by Dr. John&s;on would make one a fool all one's life;"</Q> and that I an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Madam, I &s;hall make him a fool to-day, by repeating this to him,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am too old to be made a fool; but if you &s;ay I am, I &s;hall not deny it.

<P>On the evening of Saturday, May 15, he was in fine &s;pirits, at our E&s;&s;ex-Head-Club. He told us, <Q REND="inline">"I dined ye&s;terday at Mrs. Garrick's, with Mrs.

There is no proportion between the powers which he &s;hews in &s;erious talk and in jocularity. When he lets him&s;elf down to that, he is in the kennel."</Q> I have in another place<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</Q> edit. 3, p. 20.</NOTE> oppo&s;ed, and I hope with &s;ucce&s;s, Dr. John&s;on's very &s;ingular and erroneous notion as to Mr. Burke's plea&s;antry. Mr. Windham now &s;aid low to me, that he differed from our great friend in this ob&s;ervation; for that Mr. Burke was often very happy in his merriment. It would not have been right for either of us to have contradicted John&s;on at this time, in a Society all of whom did not know and value Mr. Burke as much as we did. It might have occa&s;ioned &s;ome|thing more rough, and at any rate would probably have checked the flow of John&s;on's good-humour. He called to us with a &s;udden air of exultation, as the thought &s;tarted into his mind, <Q REND="inline">"O! Gentlemen, I mu&s;t tell you a very great thing. The Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia has ordered the 'Rambler' to be tran&s;lated into the Ru&s;&s;ian language <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">I have &s;ince heard that the report was not well-founded; but the elation di&s;covered by John&s;on in the belief that it was true, &s;hewed a noble ardour for literary fame.</NOTE>. So I &s;hall be read on the banks of
<PB N="492" REF="494" MS="y">
 the Wolga. Horace boa&s;ts that his fame would extend as far as the banks of the Rhone; now the Wolga is farther from me than the Rhone was from Horace."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t certainly be plea&s;ed with this, Sir."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I am plea&s;ed, Sir, to be &s;ure. A man is plea&s;ed to find he has &s;ucceeded in that which he has endeavoured to do."</Q></P>
<P>One of the company mentioned his having &s;een a noble per&s;on driving in his carriage, and looking exceedingly well, notwith&s;tanding his great age. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Ah, Sir; that is nothing. Bacon ob&s;erves, that a &s;tout healthy old man is like a tower undermined."</Q></P>
<P>On Sunday, May 16, I found him alone; he talked of Mrs. Thrale with much concern, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, &s;he has done every thing wrong, &s;ince Thrale's bridle was off her neck;"</Q> and was proceeding to mention &s;ome circum&s;tances which have &s;ince been the &s;ubject of publick di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, when he was inter|rupted by the arrival of Dr. Douglas, now Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le.</P>
<P>Dr. Douglas, upon this occa&s;ion, refuted a mi&s;taken notion which is very common in Scotland, that the eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline of the Church of Eng|land, though duly enforced, is in&s;ufficient to pre&s;erve the morals of the clergy, ina&s;much as all delinquents may be &s;creened by appealing to the Convocation, which being never authorized by the King to &s;it for the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s, the appeal never can be heard. Dr. Douglas ob&s;erved, that this was founded upon ignorance; for that the Bi&s;hops have &s;ufficient power to maintain di&s;ci|pline, and that the &s;itting of the Convocation was wholly immaterial in this re&s;pect, it being not a Court of judicature, but like a parliament, to make Canons and regulations as times may require.</P>
<P>John&s;on, talking of the fear of death, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Some people are not afraid, becau&s;e they look upon &s;alvation as the effect of an ab&s;olute decree, and think they feel in them&s;elves the marks of &s;anctification. Others, and tho&s;e the mo&s;t rational in my opinion, look upon &s;alvation as conditional; and as they never can be &s;ure that they have complied with the conditions, they are afraid."</Q></P>
<P>In one of his little manu&s;cript diaries, about this time, I find a &s;hort notice, which marks his amiable di&s;po&s;ition more certainly than a thou&s;and &s;tudied declarations.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Afternoon &s;pent cheerfully and elegantly, I hope without offence to GOD or man; though in no holy duty, yet in the general exerci&s;e and cultivation of benevolence."</Q></P>
<P>On Monday, May 17, I dined with him at Mr. Dilly's, where were Colonel Vallancy, Reverend Dr. Gibbons, and Mr. Capel Lofft, who, though a mo&s;t zealous Whig, has a mind &s;o full of learning and knowledge, and &s;o
<PB N="493" REF="495" MS="y">
much in exerci&s;e in various exertions, and withal &s;o much liberality, that  the &s;tupendous powers of the literary Goliath, though they did not frighten this little David of popular &s;pirit, could not but excite his admiration. There was al&s;o Mr. Braithwaite of the Po&s;t-office, that amiable and friendly man, who, with mode&s;t and una&s;&s;uming manners, has a&s;&s;ociated with many of the wits of the age. John&s;on was very quie&s;cent to-day. Perhaps too I was indolent. I find nothing more of him in my notes, but that when I mentioned that I had &s;een in the King's library &s;ixty-three editions of my favourite Thomas &agrave; Kempis, among&s;t which it was in eight languages, Latin, German, French, Italian, Spani&s;h, Engli&s;h, Arabick, and Armenian, he &s;aid, he thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to collect many editions of a book, which were all the &s;ame, except as to the paper and print; he would have the original, and all the tran&s;lations, and all the editions which had any variations in the text. He approved of the famous collection of editions of Horace by Douglas, mentioned by Pope, who is &s;aid to have had a clo&s;et filled with them; and he &s;aid, every man &s;hould try to collect one book in that manner, and pre&s;ent it to a publick library.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, May 17, I &s;aw him for a &s;hort time in the morning. I told him that the mob had called out, as the King pa&s;&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"No Fox&mdash;No Fox,"</Q> which I did not like. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"They were right, Sir."</Q> I &s;aid, I thought not, for it &s;eemed to be making Mr. Fox the King's competitor. There being no audience, &s;o that there could be no triumph in a victory, he fairly agreed with me. I &s;aid it might do very well, if explained thus: <Q REND="inline">"Let us have no Fox;"</Q> under&s;tanding it as a prayer to his Maje&s;ty not to appoint that gentleman mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, May 19, I &s;at a part of the evening with him, by our&s;elves. I ob&s;erved, that the death of our friends might be a con&s;olation again&s;t the fear of our own di&s;&s;olution, becau&s;e we might have more friends in the other world than in this. He perhaps felt this as a reflection upon his apprehen&s;ion as to death; and &s;aid, with heat, <Q REND="inline">"How can a man know <HI>where</HI> his departed friends are, or whether they will be his friends in the other world. How many friend&s;hips have you known formed upon principles of virtue? Mo&s;t friend|&s;hips are formed by caprice or by chance, mere confederacies in vice or leagues in folly."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of our worthy friend Mr. Langton. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I know not who will go to Heaven if Langton does not. Sir, I could almo&s;t &s;ay, <HI>Sit anima mea cum Langtono.</HI>"</Q> I mentioned a very eminent friend as a virtuous man. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; but&mdash;has not the evangelical virtue of Langton.&mdash;, I am afraid, would not &s;cruple to pick up a wench."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="494" REF="496" MS="y">
 He however charged Mr. Langton with what he thought want of judge|ment upon an intere&s;ting occa&s;ion. <Q REND="inline">"When I was ill (&s;aid he) I de&s;ired he would tell me &s;incerely in what he thought my life was faulty. Sir, he brought me a &s;heet of paper, on which he had written down &s;everal texts of Scripture, recommending chri&s;tian charity. And when I que&s;tioned him what occa&s;ion I had given for &s;uch an animadver&s;ion, all that he could &s;ay amounted to this&mdash;that I &s;ometimes contradicted people in conver&s;ation. Now what harm does it do to any man to be contradicted?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e he meant the <HI>manner</HI> of doing it; roughly&mdash;and har&s;hly."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"And who is the wor&s;e for that?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"It hurts people of weak nerves."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I know no &s;uch weak-nerved people."</Q> Mr. Burke, to whom I related this conference, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It is well, if when a man comes to die, he has nothing heavier upon his con&s;cience than having been a little rough in conver&s;ation."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on, at the time when the paper was pre&s;ented to him, though at fir&s;t plea&s;ed with the attention of his friend, whom he thanked in an earne&s;t manner, &s;oon exclaimed, in a loud and angry tone, <Q REND="inline">"What is your drift, Sir?"</Q> Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds plea&s;antly ob&s;erved, that it was a &s;cene for a comedy, to &s;ee a penitent get into a violent pa&s;&s;ion and belabour his confe&s;&s;or <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">After all, I cannot but be of opinion, that as Mr. Langton was &s;eriou&s;ly reque&s;ted by Dr. John&s;on to mention what appeared to him erroneous in the character of his friend, he was bound, as an hone&s;t man, to intimate what he really thought, which he certainly did in the mo&s;t delicate manner; &s;o that John&s;on him&s;elf, when in a quiet frame, was plea&s;ed with it. The texts &s;ugge&s;ted are now before me, and I &s;hall quote a few of them. <Q REND="inline">"Ble&s;&s;ed are the meek, for they &s;hall inherit the earth."</Q> <HI>Mat.</HI> v. 5.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I therefore, the pri&s;oner of the LORD, be&s;eech you, that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called.

<P>I have pre&s;erved no more of his conver&s;ation at the times when I &s;aw him during the re&s;t of this month, till Sunday, the 30th of May, when I met him in the evening at Mr. Hoole's, where there was a large company both of ladies and gentlemen; Sir James John&s;ton happened to &s;ay, that he paid no regard to the arguments of coun&s;el at the bar of the Hou&s;e of Commons, becau&s;e they were paid for &s;peaking. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, argument is argument. You cannot help paying regard to their arguments if they are good. If it were te&s;timony you might di&s;regard it, if you knew that it were purcha&s;ed. There is a beautiful image in Bacon upon this &s;ubject; te&s;timony
<PB N="495" REF="497" MS="y">
is like an arrow &s;hot from a long bow; the force of it depends on the &s;trength  of the hand that draws it. Argument is like an arrow from a cro&s;s-bow, which has equal force though &s;hot by a child."</Q></P>
<P>He had dined that day at Mr. Hoole's, and Mi&s;s Helen Maria Williams being expected in the evening, Mr. Hoole put into his hands her beautiful <Q REND="inline">"Ode on the Peace <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">The Peace made by that very able &s;tate&s;man, the Earl of Shelburne, now Marquis of Lan&s;downe, which may fairly be con&s;idered as the foundation of all the pro&s;perity of Great-Britain &s;ince that time.</NOTE>;"</Q> John&s;on read it over, and when this amiable, elegant, and accompli&s;hed young lady was pre&s;ented to him, he took her by the hand in the mo&s;t courteous manner, and repeated the fine&s;t &s;tanza of her poem; this was the mo&s;t delicate and plea&s;ing compliment he could pay. Her re&s;pectable friend, Dr. Kippis, from whom I had this anecdote, was &s;tanding by, and was not a little gratified.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Williams told me, that the only other time &s;he was fortunate enough to be in Dr. John&s;on's company, he a&s;ked her to &s;it down by him, which &s;he did, and upon her enquiring how he was, he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"I am very ill indeed, Madam. I am very ill even when you are near me; what &s;hould I be were you at a di&s;tance."</Q></P>
<P>He had now a great de&s;ire to go to Oxford, as his fir&s;t jaunt after his illne&s;s; we talked of it for &s;ome days, and I had promi&s;ed to accompany him. He was impatient and fretful to-night, becau&s;e I did not at once agree to go with him on Thur&s;day. When I con&s;idered how ill he had been, and what allowance &s;hould be made for the influence of &s;ickne&s;s upon his temper, I re&s;olved to indulge him, though with &s;ome inconvenience to my&s;elf, as I wi&s;hed to attend the mu&s;ical meeting in honour of Handel, in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, on the following Saturday.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of his own di&s;ea&s;es and pains, he was ever compa&s;&s;ionate to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others, and actively earne&s;t in procuring them aid, as appears from a note to Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, of June 1, in the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline">"I am a&s;hamed to a&s;k for &s;ome relief for a poor man, to whom, I hope, I have given what I can be expected to &s;pare. The man importunes me, and the blow goes round. I am going to try another air on Thur&s;day."</Q></P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, June 3, the Oxford po&s;t-coach took us up in the morning at Bolt-court. The other two pa&s;&s;engers were Mrs. Beresford and her daughter, two very agreeable ladies from America; they were going to Wor|ce&s;ter&s;hire, where they then re&s;ided. Frank had been &s;ent by his ma&s;ter the day before to take places for us; and I found from the way-bill, that Dr. John&s;on had made our names be put down. Mrs. Beresford, who had read
<PB N="496" REF="498" MS="y">
 it, whi&s;pered me, <Q REND="inline">"Is this the great Dr. John&s;on?"</Q> I told her it was; &s;o &s;he was then prepared to li&s;ten. As &s;he &s;oon happened to mention in a voice &s;o low that John&s;on did not hear it, that her hu&s;band had been a member of the American Congre&s;s, I cautioned her to beware of introducing that &s;ubject, as &s;he mu&s;t know how very violent John&s;on was again&s;t the people of that country. He talked a great deal, but I am &s;orry I have pre&s;erved little of the conver&s;ation. Mi&s;s Beresford was &s;o much charmed, that &s;he &s;aid to me a&s;ide, <Q REND="inline">"How he does talk! Every &s;entence is an e&s;&s;ay."</Q> She amu&s;ed her&s;elf in the coach with knotting; he would &s;carcely allow this &s;pecies of employ|ment any merit. <Q REND="inline">"Next to mere idlene&s;s (&s;aid he) I think knotting is to be reckoned in the &s;cale of in&s;ignificance; though I once attempted to learn knotting. Demp&s;ter's &s;i&s;ter (looking to me) endeavoured to teach me it; but I made no progre&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed at his talking without re&s;erve in the publick po&s;t-coach of the &s;tate of his affairs; <Q REND="inline">"I have (&s;aid he) about the world I think above a thou&s;and pounds, which I intend &s;hall afford Frank an annuity of &s;eventy pounds a year."</Q></P>
<P>At the inn where we &s;topped he was exceedingly di&s;&s;atisfied with &s;ome roa&s;t mutton which we had for dinner. The ladies I &s;aw wondered to &s;ee the great philo&s;opher, who&s;e wi&s;dom and wit they had been admiring all the way, get into ill-humour from &s;uch a cau&s;e. He &s;colded the waiter, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"It is as bad as bad can be. It is ill-fed, ill-killed, ill-kept, and ill-dre&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>He bore the journey very well, and &s;eemed to feel him&s;elf elevated as he approached Oxford, that magnificent and venerable &s;eat of Learning, Ortho|doxy, and Toryi&s;m. Frank came in the heavy coach, in readine&s;s to attend him; and we were received with the mo&s;t polite ho&s;pitality at the hou&s;e of his old friend Dr. Adams, Ma&s;ter of Pembroke College, who had given us a kind invitation. Before we were &s;et down, I communicated to John&s;on my having engaged to return to London directly, for the rea&s;on I have men|tioned, but that I would ha&s;ten down to him again. He was plea&s;ed that I had made this journey merely to keep him company. He was ea&s;y and placid, with Dr. Adams, Mrs. and Mi&s;s Adams, and Mrs. Kennicot, widow of the learned Hebraean, who was here on a vi&s;it. He &s;oon di&s;patched the inquiries which were made about his illne&s;s and recovery, by a &s;hort and di&s;tinct narrative; and then a&s;&s;uming a gay air, repeated from Swift,
<Q><L>"Nor think on our approaching ills,</L>
<L>"And talk of &s;pectacles and pills."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="504" REF="499">
Dr. Newton, the Bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, having been mentioned, John&s;on,  recollecting the manner in which he had been mentioned by that Prelate <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Dr. Newton in his Account of his own Life, after animadverting upon Mr. Gibbon's Hi&s;tory, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Dr. John&s;on&punc; 'Lives of the Poets' afforded more amu&s;ement; but candour was much hurt and offended at the malevolence that predominates in every part. Some pa&s;&s;ages, it mu&s;t be allowed, are judicious and well written, but make not &s;ufficient compen&s;ation for &s;o much &s;pleen and ill humour. Never was any biographer more &s;paring of his prai&s;e, or more abundant in his cen&s;ures. He &s;eemingly delights more in expo&s;ing blemi&s;hes, than in recom|mending beauties; &s;lightly pa&s;&s;es over excellencies, enlarges upon imperfections, and not content with his own &s;evere reflections, revives old &s;candal, and produces large quotations from the forgotten works of former criticks. His reputation was &s;o high in the republick of letters, that it wanted not to be rai&s;ed upon the ruins of others. But the&s;e E&s;&s;ays, in&s;tead of rai&s;ing a higher idea than was before entertained of his under&s;tanding, have certainly given the world a wor&s;e opinion of his temper."</Q> The Bi&s;hop was therefore the more &s;urprized and concerned for his town&s;man, for <HI>he</HI> <Q REND="inline">"re&s;pected him not only for his genius and learning, but valued him much more for the more amiable part of his character, his humanity and charity, his morality and religion."</Q> The la&s;t &s;entence we may con&s;ider as the general and permanent opinion of Bi&s;hop Newton; the remarks which precede it mu&s;t, by all who have read John&s;on's admirable work, be imputed to the di&s;gu&s;t and peevi&s;hne&s;s of old age. I wi&s;h it had not appeared, and that Dr. John&s;on had not been provoked by it to expre&s;s him&s;elf, not in re&s;pectful terms, of a Prelate, who&s;e labours were certainly of con&s;iderable advantage both to literature and religion.</NOTE>, thus retaliated:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Tom knew he &s;hould be dead before what he has &s;aid of me would appear. He dur&s;t not have printed it while he was alive."</Q> DR. ADAMS. <Q REND="inline">"I believe his 'Di&s;&s;ertations on the Prophecies' is his great work."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, it is <HI>Tom's</HI> great work; but how far it is great, or how much of it is Tom's, are other que&s;tions. I fancy a con&s;iderable part of it was borrowed."</Q> DR. ADAMS. <Q REND="inline">"He was a very &s;ucce&s;sful man."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I don't think &s;o, Sir.&mdash;He did not get very high. He was late in getting what he did get; and he did not get it by the be&s;t means. I believe he was a gro&s;s flatterer."</Q></P>
<P>I fulfilled my intention by going to London, and returned to Oxford on Wedne&s;day the 9th of June, when I was happy to find my&s;elf again in the &s;ame agreeable circle at Pembroke College, with the comfortable pro&s;pect of making &s;ome &s;tay. John&s;on welcomed my return with more than ordinary glee.</P>
<P>He talked with great regard of the Honourable Archibald Campbell, who&s;e character he had given at the Duke of Argyll's table, when we were at Inveraray <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</Q> 3d edit. p. 371.</NOTE>; and at this time wrote out for me, in his own hand, a fuller account of that learned and venerable writer, which I have publi&s;hed in its
<PB N="498" REF="500" MS="y">
 proper place. John&s;on made a remark this evening which &s;truck me a good deal. <Q REND="inline">"I never (&s;aid he) knew a nonjuror who could rea&s;on."</Q> Surely he did not mean to deny that faculty to many of their writers; to Hickes, Brett, and other eminent divines of that per&s;ua&s;ion; and did not recollect that the &s;even Bi&s;hops, &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated for their magnanimous re&s;i&s;tance of arbitrary power, were yet Nonjurors to the new Government. The non|juring clergy of Scotland, indeed, who, excepting a few, have lately, by a &s;udden &s;troke, cut off all ties of allegiance to the hou&s;e of Stuart, and re&s;olved to pray for our pre&s;ent lawful Sovereign by name, may be thought to have confirmed this remark; as it may be &s;aid, that the divine indefea&s;ible hereditary right which they profe&s;&s;ed to believe, if ever true, mu&s;t be equally true &s;till. Many of my readers will be &s;urprized when I mention, that John&s;on a&s;&s;ured me he had never in his life been in a nonjuring meeting|hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Next morning at breakfa&s;t, he pointed out a pa&s;&s;age in Savage's <Q REND="inline">"Wanderer,"</Q> &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"The&s;e are fine ver&s;es."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If (&s;aid he) I had written with ho&s;tility of Warburton in my Shak&s;peare, I &s;hould have quoted this couplet:
<Q><L>'Here Learning, blinded fir&s;t, and then beguil'd,</L>
<L>'Looks dark as Ignorance, as Fancy wild.'</L></Q>
You &s;ee they'd have fitted him to a <HI>T,</HI>"</Q> (&s;miling). DR. ADAMS. <Q REND="inline">"But you did not write again&s;t Warburton."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, I treated him with great re&s;pect both in my Preface and in my Notes."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Kennicot &s;poke of her brother, the Reverend Mr. Chamberlayne, who had given up good preferments in the Church of England on his con|ver&s;ion to the Roman Catholick faith. John&s;on, who warmly admired every man who acted from a con&s;cientious regard to principle, erroneous or not, exclaimed &s;ervently, <Q REND="inline">"GOD ble&s;s him."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Kennicot, in confirmation of Dr. John&s;on's opinion, that the pre&s;ent was not wor&s;e than former ages, mentioned that her brother a&s;&s;ured her, there was now le&s;s infidelity on the Continent than there had been; Voltaire and Rou&s;&s;eau were le&s;s read. I a&s;&s;erted, from good authority, that Hume's infidelity was certainly le&s;s read. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"All infidel writers drop into oblivion, when per&s;onal connections and the floridne&s;s of novelty are gone; though now and then a fooli&s;h fellow, who thinks he can be witty upon them, may bring them again into notice.

<P>On the Roman Catholick religion he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If you join the Papi&s;ts exter|nally, they will not interrogate you &s;trictly as to your belief in their tenets. No rea&s;oning Papi&s;t believes every article of their faith. There is one &s;ide on which a good man might be per&s;uaded to embrace it. A good man, of a timorous di&s;po&s;ition, in great doubt of his acceptance with GOD, and pretty credulous, might be glad to be of a church where there are &s;o many helps to get to Heaven. I would be a Papi&s;t if I could. I have fear enough; but an ob&s;tinate rationality prevents me. I &s;hall never be a Papi&s;t, unle&s;s on the near approach of death, of which I have a very great terrour. I wonder that women are not all Papi&s;ts."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"They are not more afraid of death than men are."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e they are le&s;s wicked."</Q> DR.

He'll beat you all at piety."</Q></P>
<P>He argued in defence of &s;ome of the peculiar tenets of the Church of Rome. As to the giving the bread only to the laity, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"They may think, that in what is merely ritual, deviations from the primitive mode may be admitted

<P>I was happy to produce &s;o judicious and elegant a &s;upporter <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot"><P>The Sermon thus opens:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That there are angels and &s;pirits good and bad; that at the head of the&s;e la&s;t there is ONE more con&s;iderable and malignant than the re&s;t, who in the form, or under the name of a <HI>&s;erpent,</HI> was deeply concerned in the fall of man, and who&s;e <HI>head,</HI> as the prophetick language is, the &s;on of man was one day to <HI>brui&s;e;</HI> that this evil &s;pirit, though that prophecy be in part completed, has not yet received his death's wound, but is &s;till permitted, for ends un&s;earchable to us, and in ways which we cannot particularly explain, to have a certain degree of power in this world ho&s;tile to its virtue and happine&s;s, and &s;ometimes exerted with too much &s;ucce&s;s; all this is &s;o clear from Scripture, that no believer, unle&s;s he be fir&s;t of all <HI>&s;poiled by philo&s;ophy and vain deceit,</HI> can po&s;&s;ibly entertain a doubt of it."</Q></P>
<P>Having treated of <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,</HI> his Lord&s;hip &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"As I have no authority to affirm that there <HI>are</HI> now any &s;uch, &s;o neither may I pre&s;ume to &s;ay with confidence, that there are <HI>not</HI> any."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But then with regard to the influence of evil &s;pirits at this day upon the SOULS of men, I &s;hall take leave to be a great deal more peremptory.&mdash;[Then, having &s;tated the various proofs], All this I &s;ay is &s;o manife&s;t to every one who reads the Scriptures, that if we re&s;pect their authority, the que&s;tion concerning the reality of the demonick influence upon the minds of men is clearly determined."</Q></P>
<P>Let it be remembered, that the&s;e are not the words of an antiquated or ob&s;cure enthu&s;ia&s;t, but of a learned and polite Prelate now alive; and were &s;poken, not to a vulgar congregation, but to the Honourable Society of Lincoln's-Inn. His Lord&s;hip in this Sermon explains the words, <Q REND="inline">"deliver us from evil,"</Q> in the Lord's Prayer, as &s;ignifying a reque&s;t to be protected from <Q REND="inline">"the evil one,"</Q> that is, the Devil. This is well illu&s;trated in a &s;hort but excellent Commentary by my late worthy friend, the Reverend Dr. Lort, of whom it may truly be &s;aid, <HI>Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit.</HI> It is remarkable that Waller in his <Q REND="inline">"Reflections on the &s;everal Petitions,"</Q> in that &s;acred form of devotion, has under&s;tood this in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e,

therefore of wonder and my&s;tery in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, be conte&s;ted by &s;ome  with an unthinking a&s;&s;urance and flippancy.</P>
<P>After dinner, when one of us talked of there being a great enmity between Whig and Tory. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why not &s;o much, I think, unle&s;s when they come into competition with each other. There is none when they are only common acquaintance, none when they are of different &s;exes. A Tory will marry into a Whig family, and a Whig into a Tory family, without any reluctance. But indeed in a matter of much more concern than political tenets, and that is religion, men and women do not concern them&s;elves much about difference of opinion. And ladies &s;et no value on the moral character of men who pay their addre&s;&s;es to them; the greate&s;t profligate will be as well received as the man of the greate&s;t virtue, and this by a very good woman, by a woman who &s;ays her prayers three times a day."</Q> Our ladies endeavoured to defend their &s;ex from this charge; but he roared them down! <Q REND="inline">"No, no; a lady will take Jonathan Wild as readily as St. Au&s;tin, if he has three-pence more; and, what is wor&s;e, her parents will give her to him. Women have a perpetual envy of our vices; they are le&s;s vicious than we, not from choice, but becau&s;e we re&s;trict them; they are the &s;laves of order and fa&s;hion; their virtue is of more con&s;equence to us than our own, &s;o far as concerns this world."</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Adams mentioned a gentleman of licentious character, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Suppo&s;e I had a mind to marry that gentleman, would my parents con&s;ent."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, they'd con&s;ent, and you'd go. You'd go though they did not con&s;ent."</Q> MISS ADAMS. <Q REND="inline">"Perhaps their oppo&s;ing might make me go."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"O, very well; you'd take one whom you think a bad man, to have the plea&s;ure of vexing your parents. You put me in mind of Dr. Barrowby the phy&s;ician, who was very fond of &s;wine's fle&s;h. One day when he was eating it, he &s;aid, 'I wi&s;h I was a Jew.'&mdash;'Why, &s;o? (&s;aid &s;ome|body); the Jews are not allowed to eat your favourite meat.'&mdash;'Becau&s;e (&s;aid he) I &s;hould then have the gu&s;t of eating it, with the plea&s;ure of &s;inning."</Q> He then proceeded in his declamation.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Adams &s;oon afterwards made an ob&s;ervation that I do not recollect, which plea&s;ed him much; he &s;aid with a good-humoured &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"That there &s;hould be &s;o much excellence united with &s;o much depravity is &s;trange."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="502" REF="504" MS="y">
 Indeed, this lady's good qualities, merit, and accompli&s;hments, and her con&s;tant attention to Dr. John&s;on, were not lo&s;t upon him. She happened to tell him that a little coffee-pot, in which &s;he had made his coffee, was the only thing &s;he could call her own. He turned to her with a complacent gallantry, <Q REND="inline">"Don't &s;ay &s;o, my dear&punc; I hope you don't reckon my heart as nothing."</Q></P>
<P>I a&s;ked him if it was true as reported, that he had &s;aid lately, <Q REND="inline">"I am for the King again&s;t Fox; but I am for Fox again&s;t Pitt."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; the King is my ma&s;ter; but I do not know Pitt; and Fox is my friend."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Fox (added he) is a mo&s;t extraordinary man; here is a man (de&s;cribing him in &s;trong terms of objection in &s;ome re&s;pects according as he appre|hended, but which exalted his abilities the more) who has divided the king|dom with Cae&s;ar; &s;o that it was a doubt whether the nation &s;hould be ruled by the &s;ceptre of George the Third, or the tongue of Fox."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Wall, phy&s;ician at Oxford, drank tea with us. John&s;on had in general a peculiar plea&s;ure in the company of phy&s;icians, which was certainly not abated by the conver&s;ation of this learned, ingenious, and plea&s;ing gentleman. John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It is wonderful how little good Radcliffe's travelling fellow|&s;hips have done. I know nothing that has been imported by them; yet many additions to our medical knowledge might be got in foreign countries. Inoculation, for in&s;tance, has &s;aved more lives than war de&s;troys. And the cures performed by the Peruvian-bark are innumerable. But it is in vain to &s;end our travelling phy&s;icians to France, and Italy, and Germany, for all that is known there is known here; I'd &s;end them out of Chri&s;tendom; I'd &s;end them among barbarous nations."</Q></P>
<P>On Friday, June 11, we talked at breakfa&s;t, of forms of prayer. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I know of no good prayers but tho&s;e in the 'Book of Common Prayer."</Q> DR. ADAMS. (in a very earne&s;t manner) <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h, Sir, you would compo&s;e &s;ome family prayers."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I will not compo&s;e prayers for you, Sir, becau&s;e you can do it for your&s;elf. But I have thought of getting together all the books of prayers which I could, &s;electing tho&s;e which &s;hould appear to me the be&s;t, putting out &s;ome, in&s;erting others, adding &s;ome prayers of my own, and prefixing a di&s;cour&s;e on prayer."</Q> We all now gathered about him, and two or three of us at a time joined in pre&s;&s;ing him to execute this plan. He &s;eemed to be a little di&s;plea&s;ed at the manner of our importunity, and in great agitation called out, <Q REND="inline">"Do not talk thus of what is &s;o aweful. I know not what time GOD will allow me in this world. There are many
<PB N="503" REF="505" MS="y">
things which I wi&s;h to do."</Q> Some of us per&s;i&s;ted, and Dr. Adams &s;aid,  <Q REND="inline">"I never was more &s;erious about any thing in my life."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Let me alone, let me alone; I am overpowered."</Q> And then he put his hands before his face, and reclined for &s;ome time upon the table.</P>
<P>I mentioned Jeremy Taylor's u&s;ing, in his forms of prayer, <Q REND="inline">"I am the chief of &s;inners,"</Q> and other &s;uch &s;elf-condemning expre&s;&s;ions. <Q REND="inline">"Now (&s;aid I) this cannot be &s;aid with truth by every man, and therefore is improper for a general printed form. I my&s;elf cannot &s;ay that I am the wor&s;t of men. I <HI>will</HI> not &s;ay &s;o."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"A man may know, that phy&s;ically, that is, in the real &s;tate of things, he is not the wor&s;t man; but that morally he may be &s;o. Law ob&s;erves, that 'Every man knows &s;omething wor&s;e of him&s;elf, than he is &s;ure of in others.' You may not have committed &s;uch crimes as &s;ome men have done; but you do not know again&s;t what degree of light they have &s;inned. Be&s;ides, Sir, 'the chief of &s;inners' is a mode of expre&s;&s;ion for 'I am a great &s;inner.' So St. Paul, &s;peaking of our SAVIOUR's having died to &s;ave &s;inners, &s;ays, 'of whom I am the chief:' yet he certainly did not think him&s;elf &s;o bad as Judas I&s;cariot."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, Taylor means it literally, for he founds a conceit upon it. When praying for the conver&s;ion of &s;inners, and of him&s;elf in particular, he &s;ays, 'LORD, thou wilt not leave thy <HI>chief</HI> work undone."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I do not approve of figurative expre&s;&s;ions in addre&s;&s;ing the Supreme Being; and I never u&s;e them. Taylor gives a very good advice: 'Never lie in your prayers; never confe&s;s more than you really believe; never promi&s;e more than you mean to perform."</Q> I recollected this precept in his <Q REND="inline">"Golden Grove."</Q> But his <HI>example</HI> for prayer contradicts his <HI>precept.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on and I went in Dr. Adams's coach to dine with Dr. Nowell, Principal of St. Mary Hall, at his beautiful villa at Iffley, on the banks of the I&s;is, about two miles from Oxford. While we were upon the road, I had the re&s;olution to a&s;k John&s;on whether he thought that the roughne&s;s of his manner had been an advantage or not, and if he would not have done more good if he had been more gentle? I proceeded to an&s;wer my&s;elf thus:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Perhaps it has been of advantage, as it has given weight to what you &s;aid. You could not, perhaps, have talked with &s;uch authority without it."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; I have done more good as I am. Ob&s;cenity and Impiety have always been repre&s;&s;ed in my company."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"True, Sir; and that is more than can be &s;aid of every Bi&s;hop. Greater liberties have been taken in the pre&s;ence of a Bi&s;hop, though a very good man, from his being milder, and therefore not commanding &s;uch awe. Yet, Sir, many people who might
<PB N="470" REF="506" MS="y">

If he had not, it was better he did not talk."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Nowell is celebrated for having preached a &s;ermon before the Hou&s;e of Commons, on the 30th of January, 1772, full of high Tory &s;entiments, for which he was thanked as u&s;ual, and printed it at their reque&s;t; but, in the mid&s;t of that turbulence and faction which di&s;graced a part of the pre&s;ent reign, the thanks were afterwards ordered to be expunged. This &s;trange conduct &s;ufficiently expo&s;es it&s;elf; and Dr. Nowell will ever have the honour which is due to a lofty friend of our monarchical con&s;titution... Dr. John&s;on &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the Court will be very much to blame if he is not pro|moted."</Q> I told this to Dr. Nowell, and a&s;&s;erting my humbler, though not le&s;s zealous exertions in the &s;ame cau&s;e, I &s;ugge&s;ted that whatever return we might receive, we &s;hould &s;till have the con&s;olation of being like Butler's &s;teady and generous Royali&s;t,
<Q><L>"True as the dial to the &s;un,</L>
<L>"Although it be not &s;hone upon."</L></Q></P>
<P>We were well entertained and very happy at Dr. Nowell's, where was a very agreeable company, and we drank <Q REND="inline">"Church and King"</Q> after dinner, with true Tory cordiality.</P>
<P>We talked of a certain clergyman of extraordinary character, who by exerting his talents in writing on temporary topicks, and di&s;playing uncommon intrepidity, had rai&s;ed him&s;elf to affluence. I maintained that we ought not to be indignant at his &s;ucce&s;s; for merit of every &s;ort was entitled to reward. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I will not allow this man to have merit. No, Sir; what he has is rather the contrary; I will, indeed, allow him courage, and on this account we &s;o far give him credit. We have more re&s;pect for a man who robs boldly on the highway, than for a fellow who jumps out of a ditch, and knocks you down behind your back. Courage is a quality &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for maintaining virtue, that it is always re&s;pected, even when it is a&s;&s;ociated with vice."</Q></P>
<P>I cen&s;ured the coar&s;e invective which was become fa&s;hionable in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and &s;aid that if members of parliament mu&s;t attack each other per&s;onally in the heat of debate, it &s;hould be done more genteelly. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; that would be much wor&s;e. Abu&s;e is not &s;o dangerous when there is no vehicle of wit or delicacy, no &s;ubtle conveyance. The difference
<PB N="505" REF="507" MS="y">
between coar&s;e and refined abu&s;e is as the difference between being brui&s;ed  by a club, and wounded by a poi&s;oned arrow."</Q> I have &s;ince ob&s;erved his po&s;ition elegantly expre&s;&s;ed by Dr. Young:
<Q><L>"As the &s;oft plume gives &s;wiftne&s;s to the dart,</L>
<L>"Good breeding &s;ends the &s;atire to the heart."</L></Q></P>
<P>On Saturday, June 12, there drank tea with us at Dr. Adams's, Mr. John Hender&s;on, &s;tudent of Pembroke-College, celebrated for his wonderful acquirements in Alchymy, Judicial A&s;trology, and other ab&s;tru&s;e and curious learning; and the Reverend Herbert Cro&s;t, who I am afraid was &s;omewhat mortified by Dr. John&s;on's not being highly plea&s;ed with &s;ome <Q REND="inline">"Family Di&s;cour&s;es,"</Q> which he had printed; they were in too familiar a &s;tyle to be approved of by &s;o manly a mind. I have no note of this evening's conver&s;ation, except a &s;ingle fragment. When I mentioned Thomas Lord Lyttelton's vi&s;ion, the prediction of the time of his death, and its exact fulfilment; JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">&punc;It is the mo&s;t extraordinary thing that has happened in my day. I heard it with my own ears, from his uncle, Lord We&s;tcote. I am &s;o glad to have every evidence of the &s;piritual world, that I am willing to believe it."</Q> Dr. ADAMS. <Q REND="inline">"You have evidence enough; good evidence, which needs not &s;uch &s;upport."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I like to have more."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Hender&s;on, with whom I had &s;auntered in the venerable walks of Merton-College, and found him a very learned and pious man, he &s;upt with us. Dr. John&s;on &s;urpri&s;ed him not a little, by acknowledging with a look of horrour, that he was much oppre&s;&s;ed by the fear of death. The amiable Dr. Adams &s;ugge&s;ted that GOD was infinitely good. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"That he is infinitely good, as far as the perfection of his nature will allow, I certainly believe; but it is nece&s;&s;ary for good upon the whole, that individuals &s;hould be puni&s;hed. As to an <HI>individual</HI> therefore, he is not infinitely good; and as I cannot be <HI>&s;ure</HI> that I have fulfilled the conditions on which &s;alvation is granted, I am afraid I may be one of tho&s;e who &s;hall be damned."</Q> (looking di&s;mally). DR. ADAMS. <Q REND="inline">"What do you mean by damned?"</Q> JOHNSON. (pa&s;&s;ionately and loudly) <Q REND="inline">"Sent to Hell, Sir, and puni&s;hed everla&s;tingly."</Q> DR. ADAMS. <Q REND="inline">"I don't believe that doctrine."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Hold, Sir; do you believe that &s;ome will be puni&s;hed at all?"</Q> DR. ADAMS. <Q REND="inline">"Being excluded from Heaven will be a puni&s;hment; yet there may be no great po&s;itive &s;uffering."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir; but, if you admit any degree of puni&s;hment, there is an end of your argument for infinite goodne&s;s &s;imply con&s;idered; for,
<PB N="506" REF="508" MS="y">
 infinite goodne&s;s would inflict no puni&s;hment whatever. There is not infinite goodne&s;s phy&s;ically con&s;idered; morally there is."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But may not a man attain to &s;uch a degree of hope as not to be unea&s;y from the fear o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> death?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"A man may have &s;uch a degree of hope as to kee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> him quiet.

<P>From the &s;ubject of death we pa&s;&s;ed to di&s;cour&s;e of life, whether it was upon the whole more happy or mi&s;erable. John&s;on was decidedly for the balance of mi&s;ery: in confirmation of which I maintained, that no man would choo&s;e to lead over again the life which he had experienced. John&s;on acceded to that opinion in the &s;tronge&s;t terms. This is an inquiry often made; and its being a &s;ubject of di&s;qui&s;ition is a proof that much mi&s;ery pre&s;&s;es upon human feelings; for tho&s;e who are con&s;cious of a felicity of exi&s;tence, would never he&s;itate to accept of a repetition of it. I have met with very few who would. I have heard Mr. Burke make u&s;e of a very ingenious and plau&s;ible argument on this &s;ubject; <Q REND="inline">"Every man (&s;aid he) would lead his life over again; for, every man is willing to go on and take an addition to his life, which as he grows older, he has no rea&s;on to think will be better, or even &s;o good as what has preceded."</Q> I imagine, however, the truth is, that there is a deceitful hope that the next part of life will be free from the pains, and anxieties, and &s;orrows which we have already felt. We are for wi&s;e purpo&s;es <Q REND="inline">"Condemn'd to Hope's delu&s;ive mine;"</Q> as John&s;on finely &s;ays; and I may al&s;o quote the celebrated lines of Dryden, equally philo&s;ophical and poetical:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"When I con&s;ider life, 'tis all a cheat,</L>

<P>It was ob&s;erved to Dr. John&s;on, that it &s;eemed &s;trange that he, who has &s;o often delighted his company by his lively and brilliant conver&s;ation, &s;hould &s;ay he was mi&s;erable. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Alas! it is all out&s;ide; I may be cracking my joke and cur&s;ing the &s;un. <HI>Sun, how I hate thy beams!</HI>"</Q> I knew not well what to think of this declaration; whether to hold it as a genuine picture of his mind <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Yet there is no doubt that a man may appear very gay in company who is &s;ad at heart. His merriment is like the &s;ound of drums and trumpets in a battle, to drown the groans of the Wounded and dying.</NOTE>, or as the effect of his per&s;uading him&s;elf contrary to fact, that the po&s;ition which he had a&s;&s;umed as to human unhappine&s;s, was true. We may apply to him a &s;entence in Mr. Greville's <Q REND="inline">"Maxims, Characters, and Re|flections <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Page 139.</NOTE>;"</Q> a book which is entitled to much more prai&s;e than it has received: <Q REND="inline">"ARISTARCHUS is charming: how full of knowledge, of &s;en&s;e, of &s;entiment. You get him with difficulty to your &s;upper; and after having delighted every body and him&s;elf for a few hours, he is obliged to return home;&mdash;he is fini&s;hing his treati&s;e, to prove that unhappine&s;s is the portion of man."</Q></P>
<P>On Sunday, June 13, our philo&s;opher was calm at breakfa&s;t. There was &s;omething exceedingly plea&s;ing in our leading a College life, without re&s;traint, and with &s;uperiour elegance, in con&s;equence of our living in the Ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, and having the company of ladies. Mrs. Kennicot related, in his pre&s;ence, a lively &s;aying of Dr. John&s;on to Mi&s;s Hannah More, who had expre&s;&s;ed a wonder that the poet who had written <Q REND="inline">"Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,"</Q> &s;hould write &s;uch poor Sonnets:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Milton, Madam, was a genius that could cut a Colo&s;&s;us from a rock; but could not carve heads upon cherry-&s;tones."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of the ca&s;ui&s;tical que&s;tion, Whether it was allowable at any time to depart from <HI>Truth?</HI> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"The general rule is, that Truth &s;hould never be violated, becau&s;e it is of the utmo&s;t importance to the comfort of life, that we &s;hould have a full &s;ecurity by mutual faith; and occa&s;ional incon|veniencies &s;hould be willingly &s;uffered that we may pre&s;erve it. There mu&s;t, however, be &s;ome exceptions. If, for in&s;tance, a murderer &s;hould a&s;k you
<PB N="508" REF="510" MS="y">
 which way a man is gone, you may tell him what is not true, becau&s;e you are under a previous obligation not to betray a man to a murderer."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Suppo&s;ing the per&s;on who wrote <HI>Junius</HI> were a&s;ked whether he was the authour, might he deny it?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I don't know what to &s;ay to this. If you were <HI>&s;ure</HI> that he wrote <HI>Junius,</HI> would you, if he denied it, think as well of him afterwards? Yet it may be urged, that what a man has no right to a&s;k, you may refu&s;e to communicate; and there is no other effectual mode of pre&s;erving a &s;ecret, and an important &s;ecret, the di&s;covery of which may be very hurtful to you, but a flat denial; for if you are &s;ilent, or he&s;itate, or evade, it will be held equivalent to a confe&s;&s;ion. But &s;tay, Sir; here is another ca&s;e. Suppo&s;ing the authour had told me confidentially that he had written <HI>Junius,</HI> and I were a&s;ked if he had, I &s;hould hold my&s;elf at liberty to deny it, as being under a previous promi&s;e, expre&s;s or implied, to conceal it. Now what I ought to do for the authour, may I not do for my&s;elf? But I deny the lawfulne&s;s of telling a lie to a &s;ick man for fear of alarming him. You have no bu&s;ine&s;s with con&s;equences: you are to tell the truth. Be&s;ides, you are not &s;ure what effect your telling him that he is in danger may have. It may bring his di&s;temper to a cri&s;is, and that may cure him. Of all lying I have the greate&s;t abhorrence at this, becau&s;e I believe it has been frequently practi&s;ed on my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>I cannot help thinking, that there is much weight in the opinion of tho&s;e who have held, that Truth, as an eternal and immutable principle, ought, upon no account whatever, to be violated, from &s;uppo&s;ed previous or &s;upe|riour obligations, of which every man being the judge for him&s;elf, there is great danger that we may too often, from partial motives, per&s;uade our&s;elves that they exi&s;t; and probably whatever extraordinary in&s;tances may &s;ometimes occur, where &s;ome evil may be prevented by violating this noble principle, it would be found that human happine&s;s would, upon the whole, be more perfect were Truth univer&s;ally pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>In the Notes to the <Q REND="inline">"Dunciad"</Q> we find the following elegant and patheticl: ver&s;es, addre&s;&s;ed to Pope <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">The annotater calls them <Q REND="inline">"amiable ver&s;es,"</Q></NOTE>:</P>

<P>It is &s;urely not a little remarkable, that they &s;hould appear without a name. Mi&s;s Seward, knowing Dr. John&s;on's almo&s;t univer&s;al and minute literary information, &s;ignified a de&s;ire that I &s;hould a&s;k him who was the authour. He was prompt with his an&s;wer:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, they were written by one Lewis, an under-ma&s;ter or u&s;her of We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, who publi&s;hed a mi&s;cellany, in which 'Grongar Hill' fir&s;t came out."</Q> John&s;on prai&s;ed them highly, and repeated them with a noble animation. In the twelfth line, in&s;tead of <Q REND="inline">"one e&s;tabli&s;hed fame,"</Q> he repeated <Q REND="inline">"one unclouded flame,"</Q> which he thought was the reading in former editions; but I believe was a fla&s;h of his own genius. It is much more poetical than the other.</P>
<P>On Monday 14, and Tue&s;day, June 15, Dr. John&s;on and I dined on one of them, I forget which, with Mr. Mickle, tran&s;lator of the <Q REND="inline">"Lu&s;iad,"</Q> at Wheatley, a very pretty country place a few miles from Oxford; and on the other with Dr. Wetherell, Ma&s;ter of Univer&s;ity-College. From Dr. We|therell's he went to vi&s;it Mr. Sackville Parker the book&s;eller; and when he returned to us, gave the following account of his vi&s;it, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I have been to &s;ee my old friend, Sack. Parker; I find he has married his maid; he has done right. She had lived with him many years in great confidence, and they had mingled minds; I do not think he could have found any wife that would have made him &s;o happy. The woman was very attentive and civil to me; &s;he pre&s;&s;ed me to fix a day for dining with them, and to &s;ay what I liked, and &s;he would be &s;ure to get it for me. Poor Sack! He is very ill, indeed. We parted as never to meet again. It has quite broke me down."</Q> This pathetick narrative was &s;trangely diver&s;ified with the
<PB N="510" REF="512" MS="y">
 grave and earne&s;t defence of a man's having married his maid. I could not but feel it as in &s;ome degree ludicrous.</P>
<P>In the morning of Tue&s;day, June 15, while we &s;at at Dr. Adams's, we talked of a printed letter from the Reverend Herbert Croft, to a young gentleman who had been his pupil, in which he advi&s;ed him to read to the end of whatever books he &s;hould begin to read. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"This is &s;urely a &s;trange advice; you may as well re&s;olve that whatever men you happen to get acquainted with, you are to keep to them for life. A book may be good for nothing; or there may be only one thing in it worth knowing; are we to read it all through? The&s;e Voyages (pointing to the three large volumes of 'Voyages to the South Sea,' which were ju&s;t come out) <HI>who</HI> will read them through? A man had better work his way before the ma&s;t, than read them through; they will be eaten by rats and mice, before they are read through. There can be little entertainment in &s;uch books; one &s;et of Savages is like another."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I do not think the people of Otaheite can be reckoned Savages."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Don't cant in defence of Savages."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"They have the art of navigation."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"A dog or a cat can &s;wim."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"They carve very ingeniou&s;ly."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"A cat can &s;cratch, and a child with a nail can &s;cratch."</Q> I perceived this was none of the <HI>mollia tempora fandi,</HI> &s;o de&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>Upon his mentioning that when he came to College he wrote his fir&s;t exerci&s;e twice over; but never did &s;o afterwards, MISS ADAMS. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, you could not make them better."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Madam, to be &s;ure, I could make them better.

<P>During our vi&s;it at Oxford, the following conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed between him and me on the &s;ubject of my trying my fortune at the Engli&s;h bar: Having a&s;ked whether a very exten&s;ive acquaintance in London, which was very valuable, and of great advantage to a man at large, might not be prejudicial to a lawyer, by preventing him from giving &s;ufficient attention to bu&s;ine&s;s. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you will attend to bu&s;ine&s;s as bu&s;ine&s;s lays hold of you. When not actually employed, you may &s;ee your friends as much as you do now. You may dine at a Club every day, and &s;up with one of the members every night; and you may be as much at publick places as one who has
<PB N="511" REF="513">
&s;een them all would wi&s;h to be. But you mu&s;t take care to attend con&s;tantly  in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall; both to mind your bu&s;ine&s;s, as it is almo&s;t all learnt there, (for nobody reads now;) and to &s;hew that you want to have bu&s;ine&s;s. And you mu&s;t not be too often &s;een at publick places, that competitors may not have it to &s;ay, 'He is always at the Playhou&s;e or at Ranelagh, and never to be found at his chambers.' And, Sir, there mu&s;t be a kind of &s;olemnity in the manner of a profe&s;&s;ional man. I have nothing particular to &s;ay to you on the &s;ubject. All this I &s;hould &s;ay to any one; I &s;hould have &s;aid it to Lord Thurlow twenty years ago."</Q></P>
<P>THE PROFESSION may probably think this repre&s;entation of what is required in a Barri&s;ter who would hope for &s;ucce&s;s, to be by much too indulgent; but certain it is, that as
<Q><L>"The wits of Charles found ea&s;ier ways to fame,"</L></Q>
&s;ome of the lawyers of this age who have ri&s;en high, have by no means thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubmit to that long and painful cour&s;e of &s;tudy which a Plowden, a Coke, a Hale con&s;idered as requi&s;ite. My re&s;pected friend, Mr. Langton, has &s;hewn me in the hand-writing of his grandfather, a curious account of a conver&s;ation which he had with Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Hale, in which that great man tells him, <Q REND="inline">"That for two years after he came to the inn of court, he &s;tudied &s;ixteen hours a day; however (his Lord&s;hip added) that by this inten&s;e application he almo&s;t brought him&s;elf to his grave, though he were of a very &s;trong con&s;titution, and after reduced him&s;elf to eight hours; but that he would not advi&s;e any body to &s;o much; that he thought &s;ix hours a day, with attention and con&s;tancy was &s;ufficient; that a man mu&s;t u&s;e his body as he would his hor&s;e, and his &s;tomach; not tire him at once, but ri&s;e with an appetite."</Q></P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, June 19, Dr. John&s;on and I returned to London; he was not well to-day, and &s;aid very little, employing him&s;elf chiefly in reading Euripides. He expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure at me, for not ob&s;erving &s;ufficiently the various objects upon the road. <Q REND="inline">"If I had your eyes, Sir, (&s;aid he) I &s;hould count the pa&s;&s;engers."</Q> It was wonderful how accurate his ob&s;ervations of vi&s;ual objects was, notwith&s;tanding his imperfect eye&s;ight, owing to a habit of attention.

 After his return to London from this excur&s;ion, I &s;aw him frequently, but have few memorandums; I &s;hall therefore here in&s;ert &s;ome particulars which I collected at various times <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><P>Having unexpectedly by the favour of Mr. Stone, of London-Field, Hackney, &s;een the original in John&s;on's hand-writing, of <Q REND="inline">"The Petition of the City of London to his Maje&s;ty, in favour of Dr. Dodd,"</Q> I now pre&s;ent it to my readers, with &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as were omitted, inclo&s;ed in crotchets, and the additions or variations marked in Italicks.</P>
<Q><P>That William Dodd, Doctor of Laws, now lying under &s;entence of death <HI>in your Maje&s;ty's gaol of Newgate,</HI> for the crime of forgery, has for a great part of his life &s;et an u&s;eful and laudable example of diligence in his calling, [and as we have rea&s;on to believe, has exerci&s;ed his mini&s;try with great fidelity and efficacy,] <HI>which in many in&s;tances has produced the mo&s;t happy effect.</HI></P>
<P>That he has been the fir&s;t in&s;titutor, [or] <HI>and</HI> a very earne&s;t and active promoter of &s;everal modes of u&s;eful charity, and [that] therefore [he] may be con&s;idered as having been on many occa&s;ions a benefactor to the publick.</P>
<P>[That when they con&s;ider his pa&s;t life, they are willing to &s;uppo&s;e his late crime to have been not the con&s;equence of habitual depravity, but the &s;ugge&s;tion of &s;ome &s;udden and violent temptation.]</P>

<P><HI>The Reverend Mr. A&s;tle, of A&s;hbourne in Derby&s;hire, brother to the learned and ingenious Thomas Aftle, E&s;q. was from his early years known to Dr. John&s;on, who obligingly advi&s;ed him as to his &s;tudies, and recommended to him the following books, of which a li&s;t which he has been plea&s;ed to com|municate, lyes before me in John&s;on's own hand-writing.</HI>&mdash;Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory (ancient).&mdash;Rollin's Ancient Hi&s;tory.&mdash;Puffendorf's Introduction to Hi&s;tory.&mdash;Vertot's Hi&s;tory of Knights of Malta.&mdash;Vertot's Revolution of Portugal.&mdash;Vertot's Revolutions of Sweden.&mdash;Carte's Hi&s;tory of England.&mdash;Pre&s;ent State of England.&mdash;Geographical Grammar.&mdash;Prideaux's Connection.&mdash;Nel&s;on's Fea&s;ts and Fa&s;ts.&mdash;Duty of Man.&mdash;Gentleman's Religion.&mdash;Clarendon's Hi&s;tory.&mdash;Watts's Improve|ment of the Mind.&mdash;Watts's Logick.&mdash;Nature Di&s;played.&mdash;Lowth's Engli&s;h Grammar.&mdash;Blackwal on the Cla&s;&s;icks.&mdash;Sherlock's Sermons.&mdash;Burnet's Life of Hale.&mdash;Dupin's Hi&s;tory of the Church.&mdash;Shuckford's Connections.&mdash;Law's Serious Call.&mdash;Walton's Complete Angler.&mdash;Sandys's Travels.&mdash;Sprat's Hi&s;tory of the Royal Society.&mdash;England's Gazetteer.&mdash;Gold&s;mith's Roman Hi&s;tory.&mdash;Some Commentaries on the Bible.</P>
<P>It having been mentioned to Dr. John&s;on that a gentleman who had a &s;on whom he imagined to have an extreme degree of timidity, re&s;olved to &s;end
<PB N="513" REF="515" MS="y">
him to a publick &s;chool, that he might acquire confidence. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid  John&s;on,) this is a prepo&s;terous expedient for removing his infirmity; &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould be cultivated in the &s;hade. Placing him at a publick &s;chool is forcing an owl upon day."</Q></P>
<P>Speaking of a gentleman who&s;e hou&s;e was much frequented by low com|pany; <Q REND="inline">"Rags, Sir, (&s;aid he,) will always make their appearance where they have a right to do it."</Q></P>
<P>Of the &s;ame gentleman's mode of living, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the &s;ervants, in&s;tead of doing what they are bid, &s;tand round the table in idle clu&s;ters, gaping upon the gue&s;ts; and &s;eem as unfit to attend a company, as to &s;teer a man of war."</Q></P>
<P>A dull country magi&s;trate gave John&s;on a long tedious account of his exerci&s;ing his criminal juri&s;diction, the re&s;ult of which was his having &s;en|tenced four convicts to tran&s;portation. John&s;on, in an agony of impatience to get rid of &s;uch a companion, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"I heartily wi&s;h, Sir, that I were a fifth."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on was pre&s;ent when a tragedy was read, in which there occurred this line:
<Q><L>"Who rules o'er freemen &s;hould him&s;elf be free."</L></Q>
The company having admired it much, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot agree with you (&s;aid John&s;on): It might as well be &s;aid,
<Q><L>'Who drives fat oxen &s;hould him&s;elf be fat."</L></Q></Q></P>
<P>He was plea&s;ed with the kindne&s;s of Mr. Cator, who was joined with him in Mr. Thrale's important tru&s;t, and thus de&s;cribes him <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Letters to Mrs. Thrale,"</Q> Vol. II. p. 284.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline">"There is much good in his character, and much u&s;efulne&s;s in his knowledge."</Q> He found a cordial &s;olace at that gentleman's &s;eat of Beckenham, in Kent, which is indeed one of the fine&s;t places at which I ever was a gue&s;t.</P>
<P>John&s;on &s;eldom encouraged general cen&s;ure of any profe&s;&s;ion; but he was willing to allow a due &s;hare of merit to the various departments nece&s;&s;ary in civili&s;ed life. In a &s;plenetick, &s;arca&s;tical, or jocular frame, however, he would &s;ometimes utter a pointed &s;aying of that nature. One in&s;tance has been men|tioned <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">See Vol. I. p. 343.</NOTE>, where he gave a &s;udden &s;atirical &s;troke to the character of an <HI>attorney.</HI> The too indi&s;criminate admi&s;&s;ion to that employment, which requires both abilities and integrity, has given ri&s;e to injurious reflections, which are totally inap|plicable to many very re&s;pectable men who exerci&s;e it with reputation and honour.</P>
<P><PB N="514" REF="516" MS="y">
 John&s;on having argued for &s;ome time with a pertinacious gentleman&punc; his opponent, who had talked in a very puzzling manner, happened to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I don't under&s;tand you, Sir:"</Q> upon which John&s;on ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I have found you an argument; but I am not obliged to find you an under&s;tanding."</Q></P>
<P>Talking to me of Horry Walpole, (as the Honourable Horace Walpole is often called,) John&s;on allowed that he got together a great many curious little things, and told them in an elegant manner. Mr. Walpole thought John&s;on a more amiable character after reading his Letters to Mrs. Thrale; but never was one of the true admirers of that great man. We may &s;uppo&s;e a prejudice conceived, if he ever heard John&s;on's account to Sir George Staunton, that when he made the &s;peeches in parliament for the Gentleman's Magazine, <Q REND="inline">"he always took care to put Sir Robert Walpole in the wrong, and to &s;ay every thing he could again&s;t the electorate of Hanover."</Q> The celebrated Heroick Epi&s;tle, in which John&s;on is &s;atyrically introduced, has been a&s;cribed both to Mr. Walpole and Mr. Ma&s;on. One day at Mr. Courtenay's, when a gentleman expre&s;&s;ed his opinion that there was more energy in that poem than could be expected from Mr. Walpole; Mr. Warton, the late Laureat ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"It may have been written by Walpole, and buckram'd by Ma&s;on."</Q></P>
<P>He di&s;approved of Lord Hailes for having moderni&s;ed the language of the ever-memorable John Hales of Eton, in an edition which his Lord&s;hip pub|li&s;hed of that writer's works. <Q REND="inline">"An authour's language, Sir, (&s;aid he,) is a characteri&s;tical part of his compo&s;ition, and is al&s;o characteri&s;tical of the age in which he writes. Be&s;ides, Sir, when the language is changed we are not &s;ure that the &s;en&s;e is the &s;ame. No, Sir; I am &s;orry Lord Hailes has done this."</Q></P>
<P>Here it may be ob&s;erved, that his frequent u&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>No, Sir,</HI> was not always to intimate contradiction; for he would &s;ay &s;o, when he was about to enforce an affirmative propo&s;ition which had not been denied, as in the in&s;tance la&s;t mentioned. I u&s;ed to con&s;ider it as a kind of flag of defiance; as if he had &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Any argument you may offer again&s;t this is not ju&s;t. No, Sir, it is not."</Q> It was like Fal&s;taff's <Q REND="inline">"I deny your Major."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds having &s;aid that he took the altitude of a man's ta&s;te by his &s;tories and his wit, and of his under&s;tanding by the remarks which he repeated; being always &s;ure that he mu&s;t be a weak man who quotes com|mon things with an empha&s;is as if they were oracles. John&s;on agreed with him; and Sir Jo&s;hua having al&s;o ob&s;erved that the real character of a man was found out by his amu&s;ements&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; no man is a hypocrite in his plea&s;ures."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="515" REF="517" MS="y">
Had John&s;on treated at large <HI>De Claris Oratoribus,</HI> he might have given  us an admirable work. When the Duke of Bedford attacked the mini&s;try as vehemently as he could, for having taken upon them to extend the time for the importation of corn, Lord Chatham, in his fir&s;t &s;peech in the Hou&s;e of Lords, boldly avowed him&s;elf to be an advi&s;er of that mea&s;ure. <Q REND="inline">"My colleagues, (&s;aid he,) as I was confined by indi&s;po&s;ition, did me the &s;ignal honour of coming to the bed-&s;ide of a &s;ick man, to a&s;k his opinion. But, had they not thus conde&s;cended, I &s;hould have <HI>taken up my bed and walked,</HI> in order to have delivered that opinion at the Council Board."</Q> Mr. Langton, who was pre&s;ent, mentioned this to John&s;on, who ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"Now, Sir, we &s;ee that he took the&s;e words as he found them; without con&s;idering, that though the expre&s;&s;ion in Scripture, <HI>take up thy bed and walk,</HI> &s;trictly &s;uited the in&s;tance of the &s;ick man re&s;tored to health and &s;trength, who would of cour&s;e be &s;uppo&s;ed to carry his bed with him, it could not be proper in the ca&s;e of a man who was lying in a &s;tate of feeblene&s;s, and who certainly would not add to the difficulty of moving at all, that of carrying his bed."</Q></P>
<P>When I pointed out to him in the news-paper one of Mr. Grattan's animated and glowing &s;peeches, in favour of the freedom of Ireland, in which this expre&s;&s;ion occurred, (I know not if accurately taken): <Q REND="inline">"We will per|&s;evere, till there is not one link of the Engli&s;h chain left to clank upon the rags of the meane&s;t beggar in Ireland."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) don't you perceive that <HI>one</HI> link cannot clank."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Thrale has publi&s;hed <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Anecdotes,"</Q> p. 43.</NOTE>, as John&s;on's, a kind of parody or counterpart of a fine poetical pa&s;&s;age in one of Mr. Burke's &s;peeches on American Tax|ation. It is vigorou&s;ly but &s;omewhat coar&s;ely executed; and I am inclined to &s;uppo&s;e, is not quite correctly exhibited. I hope he did not u&s;e the words <Q REND="inline">"<HI>vile agents</HI> for the Americans in the Hou&s;e of Parliament;"</Q> and if he did &s;o, in an extempore effu&s;ion, I wi&s;h the lady had not committed it to writing.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke uniformly &s;hewed John&s;on the greate&s;t re&s;pect; and when Mr. Town&s;hend, now Lord Sydney, at a period when he was con&s;picuous in oppo|&s;ition, threw out &s;ome reflection in parliament upon the grant of a pen&s;ion to a man of &s;uch political principles as John&s;on; Mr. Burke, though then of the &s;ame party with Mr. Town&s;hend, &s;tood warmly forth in defence of his friend, to whom, he ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, the pen&s;ion was granted &s;olely on account of his eminent literary merit. I am well a&s;&s;ured, that Mr. Town&s;hend's attack upon John&s;on was the occa&s;ion of his <Q REND="inline">"hitching in a rhyme;"</Q> for, that
<PB N="516" REF="518" MS="y">
 in the original copy of Gold&s;mith's character of Mr. Burke, in his <Q REND="inline">"Retaliation,"</Q> another per&s;on's name &s;tood in the couplet where Mr. Town&s;hend is now introduced:
<Q><L>"Though fraught with all learning, kept &s;training his throat,</L>
<L>"To per&s;uade <HI>Tommy Town&s;hend</HI> to lend him a vote."</L></Q></P>
<P>It may be worth remarking, among the <HI>minutiae</HI> of my collection, that John&s;on was once drawn for the militia, the Trained Bands of the City of London, and that Mr. Rack&s;trow, of the Mu&s;eum in Fleet-&s;treet, was his Colonel. It may be believed he did not &s;erve in per&s;on; but the idea, with all its circum&s;tances, is certainly laughable. He upon that occa&s;ion provided him&s;elf with a mu&s;ket, and with a &s;word and belt, which I have &s;een hang|ing in his clo&s;et.</P>
<P>He was very con&s;tant to tho&s;e whom he once employed, if they gave him no rea&s;on to be di&s;plea&s;ed. When &s;omebody talked of being impo&s;ed on in the purcha&s;e of tea and &s;ugar, and &s;uch articles; <Q REND="inline">"That will not be the ca&s;e, (&s;aid he,) if you go to a <HI>&s;tately &s;hop,</HI> as I always do. In &s;uch a &s;hop it is not worth their while to take a petty advantage."</Q></P>
<P>An authour of mo&s;t anxious and re&s;tle&s;s vanity being mentioned, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) there is not a young &s;apling upon Parna&s;&s;us more &s;everely blown about by every wind of critici&s;m than that poor fellow."</Q></P>
<P>The difference he ob&s;erved, between a well-bred and an ill-bred man is this: <Q REND="inline">"One immediately attracts your liking, the other your aver&s;ion. You love the one till you find rea&s;on to hate him; you hate the other till you find rea&s;on to love him."</Q></P>
<P>The wife of one of his acquaintance had fraudulently made a pur&s;e to her|&s;elf out of her hu&s;band's fortune. Feeling a proper compunction in her la&s;t moments, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed how much &s;he had &s;ecreted; but before &s;he could tell where it was placed, &s;he was &s;ei&s;ed with a convul&s;ive fit and expired. Her hu&s;band &s;aid, he was more hurt by her want of confidence in him, than by the lo&s;s of his money. <Q REND="inline">"I told him (&s;aid John&s;on) that he &s;hould con&s;ole him&s;elf; for <HI>perhaps</HI> the money might be <HI>found,</HI> and he was <HI>&s;ure</HI> that his wife was <HI>gone.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>A foppi&s;h phy&s;ician imagined that John&s;on had animadverted on his wearing a fine coat, and mentioned it to him. <Q REND="inline">"I did not notice you;"</Q> was his an&s;wer. The phy&s;ician &s;till in&s;i&s;ted. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on;) had you been dipt in Pactolus, I &s;hould not have noticed you."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="517" REF="519" MS="y">
He &s;eemed to take a plea&s;ure in &s;peaking in his own &s;tyle; for when he  had carele&s;sly mi&s;&s;ed it, he would repeat the thought tran&s;lated into it. Talking of the Comedy of <Q REND="inline">"The Rehear&s;al,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It has not wit enough to keep it &s;weet."</Q> This was ea&s;y;&mdash;he therefore caught him&s;elf, and pronounced a more rounded &s;entence, <Q REND="inline">"It has not vitality enough to pre&s;erve it from putrefaction."</Q></P>
<P>He cen&s;ured a writer of entertaining Travels for a&s;&s;uming a feigned cha|racter, &s;aying (in his &s;en&s;e of the word) <Q REND="inline">"He carries out one lye; we know not how many he brings back."</Q></P>
<P>Though he had no ta&s;te for painting, he admired much the manner in which Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds treated of his art, in his <Q REND="inline">"Di&s;cour&s;es to the Royal Academy."</Q> He ob&s;erved of a pa&s;&s;age one day, <Q REND="inline">"I think I might as well have &s;aid this my&s;elf."</Q> And once when Mr. Langton was &s;itting by him, he read one of them very eagerly, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf thus: <Q REND="inline">"Very well, Ma&s;ter Reynolds; very well, indeed. But it will not be under&s;tood."</Q></P>
<P>No man was more ready to make an apology when he had cen&s;ured unju&s;tly than John&s;on. When a proof-&s;heet of one of his works was brought to him, he found fault with the mode in which a part of it was arranged, refu&s;ed to read it, and in a pa&s;&s;ion de&s;ired that the compo&s;itor<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Compo&s;itor, in the art of printing, means, the per&s;on who adju&s;ts the types in the order in which they are to &s;tand for printing; one who arranges what is called the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> from which an impre&s;&s;ion is taken.</NOTE> might be &s;ent to him. The compo&s;itor was Mr. Manning, a decent &s;en&s;ible man, who had compo&s;ed about one half of his <Q REND="inline">"Dictionary,"</Q> when in Mr. Strahan's printing-hou&s;e; and a great part of his <Q REND="inline">"Lives of the Poets,"</Q> when in Mr. Nichols's printing-hou&s;e; and now (in his &s;eventy-&s;eventh year) when in Mr. Baldwin's printing-hou&s;e, has compo&s;ed a part of this work concerning him. By producing the manu&s;cript, he at once &s;atisfied Dr. John&s;on that he was not to blame. Upon which John&s;on candidly and earne&s;tly &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Compo&s;itor, I a&s;k your pardon. Mr. Compo&s;itor, I a&s;k your pardon, again and again."</Q></P>
<P>His generous humanity to the mi&s;erable was almo&s;t beyond example. The following in&s;tance is well atte&s;ted: Coming home late one night, he found a poor woman lying in the &s;treet, &s;o much exhau&s;ted that &s;he could not walk; he took her upon his back, and carried her to his hou&s;e, where he di&s;covered that &s;he was one of tho&s;e wretched females who had &s;allen into the lowe&s;t &s;tate of vice, poverty, and di&s;ea&s;e. In&s;tead of har&s;hly upbraiding her, he had her taken care of with all tenderne&s;s for a long time, at a con&s;iderable
<PB N="518" REF="520" MS="y">
 expence, till &s;he was re&s;tored to health, and endeavoured to put her into a virtuous way of living <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">This circum&s;tance therefore alluded to in Mr. Courtenay's <Q REND="inline">"Poetical Character,"</Q> of him is &s;trictly true.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He thought Mr. Caleb Whitefoord, &s;ingularly happy in hitting on the &s;ignature of <HI>Papyrius Cur&s;or,</HI> to his ingenious and diverting cro&s;s-readings of the news-papers; it being a real name of an ancient Roman, and clearly expre&s;&s;ive of the thing done in this lively conceit.</P>
<P>He once in his life was known to have uttered what is called a <HI>bull;</HI> Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, when they were riding together in Devon&s;hire, com|plained that he had a very bad hor&s;e, for that even when going down hill he moved &s;lowly &s;tep by &s;tep. <Q REND="inline">"Ay (&s;aid John&s;on) and when he <HI>goes</HI> up hill, he <HI>&s;tands &s;till.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>He had a great aver&s;ion to ge&s;ticulating in company. He called once to a gentleman who offended him in that point, <Q REND="inline">"Don't attitudeni&s;e."</Q> And when another gentleman thought he was giving additional force to what he uttered, by expre&s;&s;ive movements of his hands, John&s;on fairly &s;eized them, and held them down.</P>
<P>An authour of con&s;iderable eminence having engro&s;&s;ed a good &s;hare of the conver&s;ation in the company of John&s;on, and having &s;aid nothing but what was very trifling and in&s;ignificant; John&s;on when he was gone, ob&s;erved to us, <Q REND="inline">"It is wonderful what a difference there &s;ometimes is between a man's powers of writing and of talking.&mdash;writes with great &s;pirit, but is a poor talker; had he held his tongue we might have &s;uppo&s;ed him to have been re&s;train'd by mode&s;ty; but he has &s;poken a great deal to-day; and you have heard what &s;tuff it was.</Q></P>

<PB N="519" REF="521" MS="y">
<Q REND="inline">"John&s;on's Works."</Q> But he has been plea&s;ed to favour me with the following,  which are original:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"One evening, previous to the trial of Baretti, a con&s;ultation of his friends was held at the hou&s;e of Mr. Cox, the Solicitor, in Southampton-buildings, Chancery-lane. Among others pre&s;ent were, Mr. Burke and Dr. John&s;on, who differed in &s;entiments concerning the tendency of &s;ome part of the defence the pri&s;oner was to make. When the meeting was over, Mr. Steevens ob&s;erved, that the que&s;tion between him and his friend had been agitated with rather too much warmth. 'It may be &s;o, Sir, (replied the Doctor,) for Burke and I &s;hould have been of one opinion, if we had had no audience."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dr. John&s;on once a&s;&s;umed a character in which perhaps even Mr. Bo&s;well never &s;aw him. His curio&s;ity having been excited by the prai&s;es be&s;towed on the celebrated Torr&eacute;'s fireworks at Marybone-Gardens, he de&s;ired Mr. Steevens to accompany him thither. The evening had proved &s;howery; and &s;oon after the few people pre&s;ent were a&s;&s;embled, publick notice was given, that the conductors to the wheels, &s;uns, &s;tars, &amp;c. were &s;o thoroughly water-&s;oaked, that it was impo&s;&s;ible any part of the exhibition &s;hould be made. 'This is a mere excu&s;e (&s;ays the Doctor) to &s;ave their crackers for a more profitable company. Let us but hold up our &s;ticks, and threaten to break tho&s;e coloured lamps that &s;urround the Orche&s;tra, and we &s;hall &s;oon have our wi&s;hes gratified. The core of the fire-works cannot be injured; let the different pieces be touched in their re&s;pective centers, and they will do their offices as well as ever.'&mdash;Some young men who overheard him, immediately began the violence he had recommended, and an attempt was &s;peedily made to fire &s;ome of the wheels which appeared to have received the &s;malle&s;t damage; but to little purpo&s;e were they lighted, for mo&s;t of them completely failed.&mdash;The authour of 'The Rambler,' however, may be con&s;idered on this occa&s;ion, as the ring-leader of a &s;ucce&s;sful riot, though not as a &s;kilful pyrotechni&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It has been &s;uppo&s;ed that Dr. John&s;on, &s;o far as fa&s;hion was concerned, was carele&s;s of his appearance in publick. But this is not altogether true, as the following &s;light in&s;tance may &s;how:&mdash;Gold&s;mith's la&s;t Comedy was to be repre&s;ented during &s;ome court-mourning; and Mr. Steevens appointed to call on Dr. John&s;on, and carry him to the tavern where he was to dine with others of the Poet's friends. The Doctor was ready dre&s;&s;ed, but in coloured cloaths; yet being told that he would find every one el&s;e in black, received the intelligence with a profu&s;ion of thanks, ha&s;tened to change his attire, all the while repeating his gratitude for the information that had &s;aved him from an appearance &s;o improper in the front row of a front box. 'I would not

 (added he) for ten pounds, have &s;eemed &s;o retrograde to any general ob&s;ervance."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He would &s;ometimes found his di&s;likes on very &s;lender circum&s;tances. Happening one day to mention Mr. Flexman, a Di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, with &s;ome compliment to his exact memory in chronological matters; the Doctor replied, 'Let me hear no more of him, Sir. That is the fellow who made the Index to my Ramblers, and &s;et down the name of Milton thus:&mdash;Milton, <HI>Mr.</HI> John."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Steevens adds this te&s;timony, <Q REND="inline">"It is unfortunate however for John&s;on, that his particularities and frailties can be more di&s;tinctly traced than his good and amiable exertions. Could the many bounties he &s;tudiou&s;ly concealed, the many acts of humanity he performed in private, be di&s;played with equal circum&s;tantiality, his defects would be &s;o far lo&s;t in the blaze of his virtues, that the latter only would be regarded."</Q></P>
<P>Though from my very great admiration of John&s;on, I have wondered that he was not courted by all the great and all the eminent per&s;ons of his time, it ought fairly to be con&s;idered, that no man of humble birth, who lived entirely by literature, in &s;hort no authour by profe&s;&s;ion, ever ro&s;e in this country, into that per&s;onal notice which he did. In the cour&s;e of this work a numerous variety of names have been mentioned, to which many might be added. I cannot omit Lord and Lady Lucan, at who&s;e hou&s;e he often enjoyed all that an elegant table and the be&s;t company can contribute to happine&s;s; he found ho&s;pitality united with extraordinary accompli&s;hments, and embelli&s;hed with charms of which no man could be in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, June 22, I dined with him at THE LITERARY CLUB, the la&s;t time of his being in that re&s;pectable &s;ociety. The other members pre&s;ent were the Bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, Lord Eliot, Lord Palmer&s;ton, Dr. Fordyce, and Mr. Malone. He looked ill; but had &s;uch a manly fortitude, that he did not trouble the company with melancholy complaints. They all &s;hewed evident marks of kind concern about him, with which he was much plea&s;ed, and he exerted him&s;elf to be as entertaining as his indi&s;po&s;ition allowed him.</P>
<P>The anxiety of his friends to pre&s;erve &s;o e&s;timable a life, as long as human means might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have influence, made them plan for him a retreat from the &s;everity of a Briti&s;h winter, to the mild climate of Italy. This &s;cheme was at la&s;t brought to a &s;erious re&s;olution at General Paoli's, where I had often talked of it. One e&s;&s;ential matter, however, I under&s;tood was nece&s;&s;ary to be previou&s;ly &s;ettled, which was obtaining &s;uch an addition to his income, as would be &s;ufficient to enable him to defray the expence in

a manner becoming the fir&s;t literary character of a great nation, and, inde|pendent  of all his other merits, the Authour of THE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. The per&s;on to whom I above all others thought I &s;hould apply to negotiate this bu&s;ine&s;s, was the Lord Chancellor <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Edward Lord Thurlow.</NOTE>, becau&s;e I knew that he highly valued John&s;on, and that John&s;on highly valued his Lord&s;hip; &s;o that it was no degradation of my illu&s;trious friend to &s;olicit for him the favour of &s;uch a man. I have mentioned what John&s;on &s;aid of him to me when he was at the bar <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Page 441 of this Volume.</NOTE>; and after his Lord&s;hip was advanced to the &s;eals, he &s;aid of him, <Q REND="inline">"I would prepare my&s;elf for no man in England but Lord Thurlow. When I am to meet with him I &s;hould wi&s;h to know a day before."</Q> How he would have prepared him&s;elf I cannot conjecture. Would he have &s;elected certain topicks, and con&s;idered them in every view &s;o as to be in readine&s;s to argue them at all points? and what may we &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e ropicks to have been? I once &s;tarted the curious enquiry to the great man who was the &s;ubject of this compliment: he &s;miled, but did not pur&s;ue it.</P>
<P>I fir&s;t con&s;ulted with Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, who perfectly coincided in opinion with me; and I therefore, though per&s;onally very little known to his Lord&s;hip, wrote to him <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">It is &s;trange that Sir John Hawkins &s;hould have related that the application was made by Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, when he could &s;o ea&s;ily have been informed of the truth by inquiring of Sir Jo&s;hua. Sir John's carele&s;&s;ne&s;s to a&s;certain facts is very remarkable.</NOTE>, &s;tating the ca&s;e, and reque&s;ting his good offices for Dr. John&s;on. I mentioned that I was obliged to &s;et out for Scotland early in the week after, &s;o that if his Lord&s;hip &s;hould have any commands for me as to this pious negociation, he would be plea&s;ed to &s;end them before that time; otherwi&s;e Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds would give all attention to it.</P>
<P>This application was made not only without any &s;ugge&s;tion on the part of John&s;on him&s;elf, but was utterly unknown to him, nor had he the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion of it. Any in&s;inuations, therefore, which &s;ince his death have been thrown out, as if he had &s;tooped to a&s;k what was &s;uperfluous, are without any foundation. But, had he a&s;ked it, it would not have been &s;uperfluous; for though the money he had &s;aved proved to be more than his friends imagined, or than I believe he him&s;elf, in his carele&s;&s;ne&s;s concerning worldly matters, knew it to be, had he travelled upon the Continent, an augmenta|tion of his income would by no means have been unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>

 On Wedne&s;day, June 23, I vi&s;ited him in the forenoon, after having been pre&s;ent at the &s;hocking &s;ight of fifteen men executed before Newgate. I &s;aid to him, I was &s;ure that human life was not machinery, that is to &s;ay, a chain of fatality planned and directed by the Supreme Being, as it had in it &s;o much wickedne&s;s and mi&s;ery, &s;o many in&s;tances of both, as that by which my mind was now clouded. Were it machinery it would be better than it is in the&s;e re&s;pects, though le&s;s noble, as not being a &s;y&s;tem of moral government. He agreed with me now, as he always did, upon the great que&s;tion of the liberty of the human will, which has been in all ages perplexed with &s;o much &s;ophi&s;try. <Q REND="inline">But, Sir, as to the doctrine of Nece&s;&s;ity, no man believes it. If a man &s;hould give me arguments that I do not &s;ee, though I could not an&s;wer them, &s;hould I believe that I do not &s;ee?"</Q> It will be ob&s;erved, that John&s;on at all times made the ju&s;t di&s;tinction between doctrines <HI>contrary</HI> to rea&s;on, and doctrines <HI>above</HI> rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Talking of the religious di&s;cipline proper for unhappy convicts, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, one of our regular clergy will probably not impre&s;s their minds &s;ufficiently: they &s;hould be attended by a Methodi&s;t preacher, or a Popi&s;h prie&s;t."</Q> Let me however ob&s;erve, in ju&s;tice to the Reverend Mr. Vilette, who has been Ordinary of Newgate for no le&s;s than &s;eventeen years, in the cour&s;e of which he has attended many hundreds of wretched criminals, that his earne&s;t and humane exhortations have been very effectual. His extraordinary diligence is highly prai&s;e-worthy, and merits a di&s;tingui&s;hed reward.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, June 24, I dined with him at Mr. Dilly's, where were the Reverend Mr. Knox, ma&s;ter of Tunbridge-&s;chool, Mr. Smith, Vicar of Southill, Dr. Beattie, Mr. Pinkerton, authour of various literary performances, and the Reverend Dr. Mayo. At my de&s;ire old Mr. Sheridan was invited, as I was earne&s;t to have John&s;on and him brought together again by chance, that a reconciliation might be effected. Mr. Sheridan happened to come early, and having learnt that Dr. John&s;on was to be there, went away; &s;o I found, with &s;incere regret, that my friendly intentions were hopele&s;s. I recollect nothing that pa&s;&s;ed this day, except John&s;on's quickne&s;s, who, when Dr. Beattie ob&s;erved, as &s;omething remarkable which had happened to him, that he had chanced to &s;ee both No. 1, and No. 1,000, of the hackney-coaches, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t; <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, (&s;aid he,) there is an equal chance for one's &s;eeing tho&s;e two numbers as any other two."</Q> He was clearly right; yet the &s;eeing of the two extremes, each of which is in &s;ome degree more con&s;picuous than the re&s;t, could not but &s;trike one in a &s;tronger manner than the &s;ight of any other two numbers.&mdash;Though I have neglected to pre&s;erve
<PB N="523" REF="525">
his conver&s;ation, it was perhaps at this interview that Mr. Knox formed the  notion of it which he has exhibited in his <Q REND="inline">"Winter Evenings."</Q></P>
<P>On Friday, June 25, I dined with him at General Paoli's, where he &s;ays, in one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale, <Q REND="inline">"I love to dine."</Q> There were a variety of di&s;hes much to his ta&s;te, of all which he &s;eemed to me to eat &s;o much, that I was afraid he might be hurt by it; and I whi&s;pered to the General my fear, and begged he might not pre&s;s him. <Q REND="inline">"Alas! (&s;aid the General,) &s;ee how very ill he looks; he can live but a very &s;hort time. Would you refu&s;e any &s;light gratifications to a man under &s;entence of death? There is a humane cu&s;tom in Italy, by which per&s;ons in that melancholy &s;ituation are indulged with having whatever they like be&s;t to eat and drink, even with expen&s;ive delicacies."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hewed him &s;ome ver&s;es on Lichfield by Mi&s;s Seward, which I had that day received from her, and had the plea&s;ure to hear him approve of them. He confirmed to me the truth of a high compliment which I had been told he had paid to that lady, when &s;he mentioned to him <Q REND="inline">"The Colombiade,"</Q> an epick poem, by Madame du Boccage:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Madam, there is not in it any thing equal to your de&s;cription of the &s;ea round the North Pole, in your Ode on the death of Captain Cook."</Q></P>
<P>On Sunday, June 27, I found him rather better. I mentioned to him a young man who was going to Jamaica with his wife and children, in expecta|tion of being provided for by two of her brothers &s;ettled in that i&s;land, one a clergyman and the other a phy&s;ician. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It is a wild &s;cheme, Sir, unle&s;s he has a po&s;itive and deliberate invitation. There was a poor girl, who u&s;ed to come about me, who had a cou&s;in in Barbadoes, that, in a letter to her, expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h &s;he would come out to that i&s;land, and expa|tiated on the comforts and happine&s;s of her &s;ituation. The poor girl went out: her cou&s;in was much &s;urprized, and a&s;ked her how &s;he could think of coming. 'Becau&s;e (&s;aid &s;he) you invited me.'&mdash;'Not I' (an&s;wered the cou&s;in). The letter then was produced. 'I &s;ee it is true, (&s;aid &s;he,) that I did invite you; but I did not think you would come.' They lodged her in an out-hou&s;e, where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed her time mi&s;erably; and as &s;oon as &s;he had an opportunity &s;he returned to England. Always tell this, when you hear of people going abroad to relations, upon a notion of being well received. In the ca&s;e which you mention, it is probable the clergyman &s;pends all he gets, and the phy&s;ician does not know how much he is to get."</Q></P>
<P>We this day dined at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's, with General Paoli, Lord Eliot, (formerly Mr. Eliot, of Port Eliot,) Dr. Beattie, and &s;ome more
<PB N="524" REF="526" MS="y">
 company. Talking of Lord Che&s;terfield;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"His manner was exqui&s;itely elegant, and he had more knowledge than I expected."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Did you find, Sir, his conver&s;ation to be of a &s;uperiour &s;tyle."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, in the conver&s;ation which I had with him I had the be&s;t right to &s;uperiority, for it was upon philology and literature."</Q> Lord Eliot, who had travelled at the &s;ame time with Mr. Stanhope, Lord Che&s;terfield's natural &s;on, ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that it was &s;trange that a man who &s;hewed he had &s;o much affection for his &s;on as Lord Che&s;terfield did, by writing &s;o many long and anxious letters to him, almo&s;t all of them when he was Secretary of State, which certainly was a proof of great goodne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, &s;hould endeavour to make his &s;on a ra&s;cal. His Lord&s;hip told us, that Foote had intended to bring on the &s;tage a father who had thus tutored his &s;on, and to &s;hew the &s;on an hone&s;t man to every thing el&s;e, but practi&s;ing his father's maxims upon him, and cheating him. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I am much plea&s;ed with this de&s;ign; but I think there was no occa&s;ion to make the &s;on hone&s;t at all. No; he &s;hould be a con&s;ummate rogue: the contra&s;t between hone&s;ty and knavery would be the &s;tronger. It &s;hould be contrived &s;o that the father &s;hould be the only &s;ufferer by the &s;on's villainy, and thus there would be poetical ju&s;tice."</Q></P>
<P>He put Lord Eliot in mind of Dr. Walter Harte. <Q REND="inline">"I know (&s;aid he) Harte was your Lord&s;hip's tutor, and he was al&s;o tutor to the Peterborough family. Pray, my Lord, do you recollect any particulars that he told you of Lord Peterborough? He is a favourite of mine, and is not enough known: his character has been only ventilated in party pamphlets."</Q> Lord Eliot &s;aid, if Dr. John&s;on would be &s;o good as to a&s;k him any que&s;tions, he would tell what he could recollect. Accordingly &s;ome things were men|tioned. <Q REND="inline">"But (&s;aid his Lord&s;hip) the be&s;t account of Lord Peterborough that I have happened to meet with, is, 'Captain Carleton's Memoirs.' Carleton was de&s;cended of an ance&s;tor who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf at the &s;iege of Derry. He was an officer; and, what was rare at that time, had &s;ome knowledge of engineering."</Q> John&s;on &s;aid, he had never heard of the book. Lord Eliot had it at Port Eliot; but, after a good deal of enquiry, procured a copy in London, and &s;ent it to John&s;on, who told Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds that he was going to bed when it came, but was &s;o much plea&s;ed with it, that he &s;ate up till he had read it through, and found in it &s;uch an air of truth, that he could not doubt of its authenticity; adding, with a &s;mile (in allu&s;ion to Lord Eliot's having recently been rai&s;ed to the peerage,) <Q REND="inline">"I
<PB N="525" REF="527" MS="y">
did not think a <HI>young Lord</HI> could have mentioned to me a book in the Engli&s;h  hi&s;tory that was not known to me."</Q></P>
<P>An addition to our company came after we went up to the drawing-room; Dr. John&s;on &s;eemed to ri&s;e in &s;pirits as his audience increa&s;ed. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He wi&s;hed that Lord Orford's pictures, and Sir A&s;hton Lever's Mu&s;eum, might be purcha&s;ed by the publick, becau&s;e both the money, and the pictures, and the curio&s;ities, would remain in the country. Whereas, if they were &s;old into another kingdom, the nation would indeed get &s;ome money, but would lo&s;e the pictures and curio&s;ities, which it would be de&s;irable we &s;hould have for improvement in ta&s;te and natural hi&s;tory. The only que&s;tion was, that as the nation was much in want of money, whether it would not be better to take a large price from a foreign &s;tate."</Q></P>
<P>He entered upon a curious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the difference between intuition and &s;agacity, one being immediate in its effect, the other requiring a circuitous proce&s;s; one he ob&s;erved, was the <HI>eye</HI> of the mind, the other the <HI>no&s;e</HI> of the mind.</P>
<P>A gentleman pre&s;ent took up the argument again&s;t him, and maintained that no man ever thinks of the <HI>no&s;e of the mind,</HI> not adverting that though that figurative phra&s;e &s;eems &s;trange to us, as very unu&s;ual, it is truly not more forced than Hamlet's <Q REND="inline">"In my <HI>mind's eye,</HI> Horatio."</Q> He per&s;i&s;ted much too long, and appeared to John&s;on as putting him&s;elf forward as his antagoni&s;t with too much pre&s;umption; upon which he called to him in a loud tone, <Q REND="inline">"What is it you are contending for, if you <HI>be</HI> contending?"</Q>&mdash;And afterwards imagining that the gentleman retorted upon him with a kind of &s;mart drollery, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mr.&mdash;, it does not become you to talk &s;o to me. Be&s;ides, ridicule is not your talent; you have <HI>there</HI> neither intuition nor &s;agacity."</Q>&mdash;The gentleman prote&s;ted that he had intended no improper freedom, but had the greate&s;t re&s;pect for Dr. John&s;on. After a &s;hort pau&s;e, during which we were &s;omewhat unea&s;y&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Give me your hand, Sir. You were too tedious, and I was too &s;hort."</Q> MR.&mdash;. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I am honoured by your attention in any way."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Come, Sir, let's have no more of it. We offended one another by our contention; let us not offend the company by our compliments."</Q></P>
<P>He now &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He wi&s;hed much to go to Italy, and that he dreaded pa&s;&s;ing the winter in England."</Q> I &s;aid nothing, but enjoyed a &s;ecret &s;atis|faction in thinking that I had taken the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures to make &s;uch a &s;cheme practicable.</P>
<P>On Monday, June 28, I had the honour to receive from the Lord Chancellor the following letter:

<P>This letter gave me a very high &s;atisfaction; I next day went and &s;hewed it to Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, who was exceedingly plea&s;ed with it. He thought that I &s;hould now communicate the negociation to Dr. John&s;on, who might afterwards complain if the attention with which it had been honoured, &s;hould be too long concealed from him. I intended to &s;et out for Scotland next morning, but Sir Jo&s;hua cordially in&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould &s;tay another day, that John&s;on and I might dine with him, that we three might talk of his Italian Tour, and as Sir Jo&s;hua expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"have it all out."</Q> I ha&s;tened to John&s;on, and was told by him that he was rather better to-day.

Sir, (&s;aid I, with mo&s;t &s;incere affection,) your friends would do every thing for you."</Q> He pau&s;ed&mdash;grew more and more agitated&mdash;till tears &s;tarted into his eyes, and he exclaimed with fervent emotion, <Q REND="inline">"GOD ble&s;s you all."</Q> I was &s;o affected that I al&s;o &s;hed tears.&mdash;After a &s;hort &s;ilence, he renewed and extended his grateful benediction, <Q REND="inline">"GOD ble&s;s you all, for JESUS CHRIST'S &s;ake."</Q> We both remained for &s;ome time unable to &s;peak.&mdash;He ro&s;e &s;uddenly and quitted the room quite melted in tenderne&s;s. He &s;taid but a &s;hort time, till he had
<PB N="527" REF="529" MS="y">
recovered his firmne&s;s; &s;oon after he returned I left him, having fir&s;t engaged  him to dine at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's, next day.&mdash;I never was again under that roof which I had &s;o long reverenced.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, June 30, the friendly confidential dinner with Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds took place, no other company being pre&s;ent. Had I known that this was the la&s;t time that I &s;hould enjoy in this world, the conver&s;ation of a friend whom I &s;o much re&s;pected, and from whom I derived &s;o much in&s;truction and entertainment, I &s;hould have been deeply affected. When I now look back to it, I am vexed that a &s;ingle word &s;hould have been forgotten.</P>
<P>Both Sir Jo&s;hua and I were &s;o &s;anguine in our expectations, that we expatiated with confidence on the large provi&s;ion which we were &s;ure would be made for him, conjecturing whether munificence would be di&s;played in one large donation, or in an ample increa&s;e of his pen&s;ion. He him&s;elf catched &s;o much of our enthu&s;ia&s;m, as to allow him&s;elf to &s;uppo&s;e it not impo&s;&s;ible that our hopes might in one way or other be reali&s;ed. He &s;aid that he would rather have his pen&s;ion doubled than a grant of a thou&s;and pounds; <Q REND="inline">"For (&s;aid he) though probably I may not live to receive as much as a thou&s;and pounds, a man would have the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that he &s;hould pa&s;s the remainder of his life in &s;plendour, how long &s;oever it might be."</Q> Con&s;idering what a moderate proportion an income of &s;ix hundred pounds a year bears to innumerable fortunes in this country, it is worthy of remark, that a man &s;o truly great &s;hould think it &s;plendour.</P>
<P>As an in&s;tance of extraordinary liberality of friend&s;hip, he told us, that Dr. Brockle&s;by had upon this occa&s;ion, offered him a hundred a year for his life. A grateful tear &s;tarted into his eye, as he &s;poke this in a faultering tone.</P>
<P>Sir Jo&s;hua and I endeavoured to flatter his imagination with agreeable pro&s;pects of happine&s;s in Italy. <Q REND="inline">"Nay (&s;aid he) I mu&s;t not expect much of that; when a man goes to Italy merely to feel how he breathes the air, he can enjoy very little."</Q></P>
<P>Our conver&s;ation turned upon living in the country, which John&s;on, who&s;e melancholy mind required the di&s;&s;ipation of quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ive variety, had habituated him&s;elf to con&s;ider as a kind of mental impri&s;onment. <Q REND="inline">"Yet, Sir, (&s;aid I,) there are many people who are content to live in the country."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is in the intellectual world as in the phy&s;ical world; we are told by natural philo&s;ophers, that a body is at re&s;t in the place that is fit for it; they who are content to live in the country are <HI>fit</HI> for the country."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="528" REF="530" MS="y">
 Talking of various enjoyments, I argued that a refinement of ta&s;te was a di&s;advantage, as they who have attained to it mu&s;t be &s;eldomer plea&s;ed than tho&s;e who have no nice di&s;crimination, and are therefore &s;atisfied with every thing that comes in their way. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir; that is a paltry notion. Endeavour to be as perfect as you can in every re&s;pect."</Q></P>
<P>I accompanied him in Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's coach, to the entry of Bolt|court. He a&s;ked me whether I would not go with him to his hou&s;e; I declined it, from an apprehen&s;ion that my &s;pirits would &s;ink. We bade adieu to each other affectionately in the carriage. When he had got down upon the foot-pavement, he called out, <Q REND="inline">"Fare you well;"</Q> and without looking back, &s;prung away with a kind of pathetick bri&s;kne&s;s, if I may u&s;e that expre&s;&s;ion, which &s;eemed to indicate a &s;truggle to conceal unea&s;ine&s;s, and impre&s;&s;ed me with a foreboding of our long, long &s;eparation.</P>
<P>I remained one day more in town, to have the chance of talking over my negociation with the Lord Chancellor; but the multiplicity of his Lord&s;hip's important engagements did not allow of it; &s;o I left the management of the bu&s;ine&s;s in the hands of Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds.</P>
<P>Soon after this time Dr. John&s;on had the mortification of being informed by Mrs. Thrale, that <Q REND="inline">"what &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he never believed <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Letters to Mrs. Thrale,"</Q> Vol. II. page 375.</NOTE>,"</Q> was true, namely, that &s;he was actually going to marry Signor Piozzi, an Italian mu&s;ick|ma&s;ter. He endeavoured to prevent it, but in vain. If &s;he would publi&s;h the whole of the corre&s;pondence that pa&s;&s;ed between Dr. John&s;on and her on the &s;ubject, we &s;hould have a full view of his real &s;entiments. As it is, our judgement mu&s;t be bia&s;&s;ed by that characteri&s;tick &s;pecimen, which Sir John Hawkins has given us: <Q REND="inline">"Poor Thrale! I thought that either her virtue or her vice would have re&s;trained her from &s;uch a marriage. She is now become a &s;ubject for her enemies to exult over, and for her friends, if &s;he has any left, to forget, or pity <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Dr. John&s;on's Letter to Sir John Hawkins, <Q REND="inline">"Life,"</Q> p. 570,</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be admitted that John&s;on derived a con&s;iderable portion of hap|pine&s;s from the comforts and elegancies which he enjoyed in Mr. Thrale's family; but Mrs. Thrale a&s;&s;ures us he was indebted for the&s;e to her hu&s;band alone, who certainly re&s;pected him &s;incerely. Her words are, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Veneration for his virtue, reverence for his talents,</HI> delight <HI>in his conver&s;ation, and</HI> habitual endurance of a yoke my hu&s;band fir&s;t put upon me, <HI>and of which he con|tentedly bore his &s;hare for &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years, made me go on &s;o long with</HI> <NOTE PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Anecdotes,"</Q> p. 293.</NOTE>

<P>As a &s;incere friend of the great man who&s;e Life I am writing, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to guard my readers again&s;t the mi&s;taken notion of Dr. John&s;on's character, which this lady's <Q REND="inline">"Anecdotes"</Q> of him &s;ugge&s;t; for from the very nature and form of her book, it <Q REND="inline">"lends deception lighter wings to fly."</Q></P>
<Q><P>Let it be remembered, (&s;ays an eminent critick <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Who has been plea&s;ed to furni&s;h me with his remarks.</NOTE>,) that &s;he has compri&s;ed in a &s;mall volume all that &s;he could recollect of Dr. John&s;on in <HI>twenty years,</HI> during which period, doubtle&s;s, &s;ome &s;evere things were &s;aid by him; and they who read the book in <HI>two hours,</HI> naturally enough &s;uppo&s;e that his whole conver&s;ation was of this complexion. But the fact is, I have been often in his company, and never <HI>once</HI> heard him &s;ay a &s;evere thing to any one; and many others can atte&s;t the &s;ame. When he did &s;ay a &s;evere thing it was generally extorted by ignorance pretending to knowledge, or by extreme vanity or affectation.</P>
<P>Two in&s;tances of inaccuracy (adds he) are peculiarly worthy of notice:</P>
<P><HI>It is &s;aid</HI> <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Anecdotes,"</Q> p. 183.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline">'That natural roughne&s;s of his manner &s;o often mentioned, would, notwith&s;tanding the regularity of his notions bur&s;t through them all from time to time; and he once bade a very celebrated lady, who prai&s;ed him with too much zeal perhaps, or perhaps too &s;trong an empha&s;is, (which always offended him,) con&s;ider what her flattery was worth before &s;he chocked <HI>him</HI> with it.'</Q></P>
<P>Now let the genuine anecdote be contra&s;ted with this.&mdash;The per&s;on thus repre&s;ented as being har&s;hly treated, though a very celebrated lady, was <HI>then</HI> ju&s;t come to London from an ob&s;cure &s;ituation in the country.

 How different does this &s;tory appear, when accompanied with all the&s;e circum&s;tances which really belong to it, but which Mrs. Thrale either did not know, or has &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>She &s;ays <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Anecdotes,"</Q> p. 202.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline">'One gentleman, however, who dined at a nobleman's hou&s;e in his company, and that of Mr. Thrale, to whom I was obliged for the anecdote, was willing to enter the li&s;ts in defence of King William's character; and having oppo&s;ed and contradicted John&s;on two or three times, petulantly enough, the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e began to feel unea&s;y, and expect di&s;agreeable con&s;equences; to avoid which, he &s;aid, loud enough for the Doctor to hear&mdash;Our friend here has no meaning now in all this, except ju&s;t to relate at club to-morrow how he teized John&s;on at dinner to-day; this is all to do him&s;elf <HI>honour.</HI>&mdash;No, upon my word, (replied the other,) I &s;ee no <HI>honour</HI> in it, whatever you may do.&mdash;Well, Sir, (returned Mr. John&s;on, &s;ternly,) if you do not <HI>&s;ee</HI> the honour, I am &s;ure I <HI>feel</HI> the di&s;grace.'</Q></P>
<P>This is all &s;ophi&s;ticated. Mr. Thrale was not in the company, though he might have related the &s;tory to Mrs. Thrale. A friend, from whom I had the &s;tory, was pre&s;ent; and it was not at the hou&s;e of a nobleman. On the ob&s;ervation being made by the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e on a gentleman's contra|dicting John&s;on, that he had talked for the honour, &amp;c. the gentleman mut|tered, in a low voice, <Q REND="inline">'I &s;ee no honour in it;'</Q> and Dr. John&s;on &s;aid nothing: &s;o all the re&s;t (though <HI>bien trouv&eacute;e)</HI> is mere garni&s;h.</P></Q>

This work, which I fondly hope will re&s;cue his memory from obloquy, contains a thou&s;and in&s;tances of his benevolent exertions in almo&s;t every way that can be conceived; and particularly in employing his pen with a generous readine&s;s for tho&s;e to whom its aid could be u&s;eful. Indeed his obliging activity in doing little offices of kindne&s;s, both by letters and per&s;onal appli|cation, was one of the mo&s;t remarkable features in his character; and for the truth of this I can appeal to a number of his re&s;pectable friends: Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Mr. Langton, Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Burke, Mr. Windham, Mr. Malone, the Bi&s;hop of Dromore, Sir William Scott, Sir Robert Chambers.&mdash;And can Mrs. Thrale forget the adverti&s;ements which he wrote for her hu&s;band at the time of his election conte&s;t; the epitaphs on him and her mother; the playful and even trifling ver&s;es, for the amu&s;ement of her and her daughters; his corre&s;ponding with her children, and entering into their minute concerns, which &s;hews him in the mo&s;t amiable light?</P>

If&punc; therefore, there was an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for mentioning the &s;tory at all, it might have been thought that her tenderne&s;s for Dr. John&s;on's character would have di&s;po&s;ed her to &s;tate any thing that could &s;often it.

<P>It is with concern that I find my&s;elf obliged to animadvert on the inaccuracies of Mrs. Piozzi's <Q REND="inline">"Anecdotes,"</Q> and perhaps I may be thought to have dwelt too long upon her little collection.

 duty, as a faithful biographer, has obliged me reluctantly to perform this unplea&s;ing ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Having left the <HI>pious negociation,</HI> as I called it, in the be&s;t hands, I &s;hall here in&s;ert what relates to it. John&s;on wrote to Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds on July 6, as follows: <Q REND="inline">"I am going, I hope, in a few days, to try the air of Derby&s;hire, but hope to &s;ee you before I go. Let me, however, mention to you what I have much at heart.&mdash;If the Chancellor &s;hould continue his attention to Mr. Bo&s;well's reque&s;t, and confer with you on the means of relieving my languid &s;tate, I am very de&s;irous to avoid the appearance of a&s;king money upon fal&s;e pretences.

They that have your kindne&s;s may want your ardour. In the mean time I am very feeble, and very dejected."</Q></P>
<P>By a letter from Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds I was informed, that the Lord Chancellor had called on him, and acquainted him that the application had not been &s;ucce&s;sful; but that his Lord&s;hip, after &s;peaking highly in prai&s;e of John&s;on, as a man who was an honour to his country, de&s;ired Sir Jo&s;hua to let him know, that on granting a mortgage of his pen&s;ion, he &s;hould draw on his Lord&s;hip to the amount of five or &s;ix hundred pounds; and that his Lord&s;hip explained the meaning of the mortgage to be, that he wi&s;hed the bu&s;ine&s;s to be conducted in &s;uch a manner, as that Dr. John&s;on &s;hould appear to be under the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible obligation. Sir Jo&s;hua mentioned, that he had by the &s;ame po&s;t communicated all this to Dr. John&s;on.</P>
<P>How John&s;on was affected upon the occa&s;ion will appear from what he wrote to Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds:</P>
<Q><P>A&s;hbourne, Sept. 9. Many words I hope are not nece&s;&s;ary between you and me, to convince you what gratitude is excited in my heart by the Chancellor's liberality, and your kind offices. * * * * * *</P>

But it has plea&s;ed GOD to re&s;tore me to &s;o great a mea&s;ure of health, that if I &s;hould now appropriate &s;o much of a fortune de&s;tined to do good, I could not e&s;cape from my&s;elf the charge of advancing a fal&s;e claim. My journey to the continent, though I once thought it nece&s;&s;ary, was never much encouraged by my phy&s;icians; and I was very de&s;irous that your Lord&s;hip &s;hould be told of it by Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, as an event very uncertain; for if I grew much better, I &s;hould not be willing, if much wor&s;e, not able, to migrate.&mdash;Your Lord&s;hip was fir&s;t &s;olicited without my knowledge; but, when I was told, that you were plea&s;ed to honour me with your patronage, I did not expect to hear of a refu&s;al; yet, as I have had no long time to brood hope, and have not rioted in imaginary opulence, this cold reception has been &s;carce a di&s;appointment; and, from your Lord&s;hip's kindne&s;s, I have received a benefit, which only men like you are able to be&s;tow. I &s;hall now live <HI>mihi carior,</HI> with a higher opinion of my own merit.</P>

On the &s;ame day he wrote to Mr. Langton: <Q REND="inline">"I cannot but think that in  my languid and anxious &s;tate, I have &s;ome rea&s;on to complain that I receive from you neither enquiry nor con&s;olation. You know how much I value your friend&s;hip, and with what confidence I expect your kindne&s;s, if I wanted any act of tenderne&s;s that you could perform; at lea&s;t, if you do not know it, I think your ignorance is your own fault. Yet how long is it that I have lived almo&s;t in your neighbourhood without the lea&s;t notice.&mdash;I do not, however, con&s;ider this neglect as particularly &s;hown to me; I hear two of your mo&s;t valuable friends make the &s;ame complaint. But why are all thus overlooked? You are not oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;ickne&s;s, you are not di&s;tracted by bu&s;ine&s;s; if you are &s;ick, you are &s;ick of lei&s;ure:&mdash;And allow your&s;elf to be told, that no di&s;ea&s;e is more to be dreaded or avoided.

That voluntary debility, which modern language is content to term indolence, will, if it is not counteracted by re&s;olution, render in time the &s;tronge&s;t faculties lifele&s;s, and turn the flame to the &s;moke of virtue.&mdash;I do not expect nor de&s;ire to &s;ee you, becau&s;e I am much plea&s;ed to find that your mother &s;tays &s;o long with you, and I &s;hould think you neither elegant nor grateful, if you did not &s;tudy her gratification. You will pay my re&s;pects to both the ladies, and to all the young people.&mdash;I am going Northward for a while, to try what help the country can give me; but, if you will write, the letter will come after me."</Q></P>
<P>Next day he &s;et out on a jaunt to Stafford&s;hire and Derby&s;hire, flattering him&s;elf that he might be in &s;ome degree relieved.</P>
<P>During his ab&s;ence from London he kept up a corre&s;pondence with &s;everal of his friends, from which I &s;hall &s;elect what appears to me proper for publication, without attending nicely to chronological order.</P>
<P>To Dr. BROCKLESBY, he writes, A&s;hbourne, July 20. <Q REND="inline">"The kind attention which you have &s;o long &s;hewn to my health and happine&s;s, makes it as much a debt of gratitude as a call of intere&s;t, to give you an account of what befals me, when accident recovers me from your immediate care.&mdash;The journey of the fir&s;t day was performed with very little &s;en&s;e of fatigue; the &s;econd day brought me to Lichfield, without much la&s;&s;itude, but I am afraid that I could not have borne &s;uch violent agitation for many days together.
<PB N="538" REF="540" MS="y">
 Tell Dr. Heberden, that in the coach I read 'Ciceronianus,' which I concluded as I entered Lichfield. My affection and under&s;tanding went along with Era&s;mus, except that once or twice he &s;omewhat un&s;kilfully entangles Cicero's civil or moral, with his rhetorical character.&mdash;I &s;taid five days at Lichfield, but, being unable to walk, had no great plea&s;ure, and ye&s;terday (19th) I came hither, where I am to try what air and attention can perform.&mdash;Of any improvement in my health I cannot yet plea&s;e my&s;elf with the perception. * * * * * *.&mdash;The a&s;thma has no abatement. Opiates &s;top the fit, &s;o as that I can &s;it and &s;ometimes lie ea&s;y, but they do not now procure me the power of motion; and I am afraid that my general &s;trength of body does not encrea&s;e. The weather indeed is not benign; but how low is he &s;unk who&s;e &s;trength depends upon the weather!&mdash;I am now looking into Floyer, who lived with his a&s;thma to almo&s;t his ninetieth year. His book by want of order is ob&s;cure, and his a&s;thma, I think, not of the &s;ame kind with mine. Something however I may perhaps learn.&mdash;My appetite &s;till continues keen enough; and what I con&s;ider as a &s;ymptom of radical health, I have a voracious delight in raw &s;ummer fruit, of which I was le&s;s eager a few years ago.&mdash;You will be plea&s;ed to communicate this account to Dr. Heberden, and if any thing is to be done, let me have your joint opinion.&mdash;Now&mdash;<HI>abite curae</HI>&mdash;let me enquire after the Club <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">At the E&s;&s;ex Head, E&s;&s;ex-&s;treet.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>July 31. <Q REND="inline">"Not recollecting that Dr. Heberden might be at Wind&s;or, I thought your letter long in coming.

My comfort is, that he appeared to live like a man that had always before his eyes the fragility of our pre&s;ent exi&s;tence, and was therefore, I hope, not unprepared to meet his judge.&mdash;Your attention, dear Sir, and that of Dr. Heberden, to my health is extremely kind. I am loth to think that I grow wor&s;e; and cannot fairly prove even to my own par|tiality, that I grow much better."</Q></P>
<P>Augu&s;t 5. <Q REND="inline">"I return you thanks, dear Sir, for your unwearied attention, both medicinal and friendly, and hope to prove the effect of your care by living to acknowledge it."</Q></P>

My appetite is &s;till good,  which I know is dear Dr. Heberden's criterion of the <HI>vis vitae.</HI>&mdash;As we cannot now &s;ee each other, do not omit to write, for you cannot think with what warmth of expectation I reckon the hours of a po&s;t-day."</Q></P>
<P>Augu&s;t 14. <Q REND="inline">"I have hitherto &s;ent you only melancholy letters, you will be glad to hear &s;ome better account. Ye&s;terday the a&s;thma remitted, per|ceptibly remitted, and I moved with more ea&s;e than I have enjoyed for many weeks. May GOD continue his mercy.&mdash;This account I would not delay, becau&s;e I am not a lover of complaints, or complainers, and yet I have &s;ince we parted, uttered nothing till now but terrour and &s;orrow. Write to me, dear Sir."</Q></P>
<P>Augu&s;t 16. <Q REND="inline">"Better I hope, and better. My re&s;piration gets more and more ea&s;e and liberty. I went to church ye&s;terday, after a very liberal dinner, without any inconvenience; it is indeed no long walk, but I never walked it without difficulty, &s;ince I came, before. ****** the intention was only to overpower the &s;eeming <HI>vis inertiae</HI> of the pectoral and pulmonary mu&s;cles.&mdash;I am favoured with a degree of ea&s;e that very much delights me, and do not de&s;pair of another race upon the &s;tairs of the Academy.&mdash;If I were, however, of a humour to &s;ee, or to &s;how the &s;tate of my body, on the dark &s;ide, I might &s;ay,
<Q><L>'Quid te exempta juvat &s;pinis de pluribus una?'</L></Q>
The nights are &s;till &s;leeple&s;s, and the water ri&s;es, though it does not ri&s;e very fa&s;t. Let us, however, rejoice in all the good that we have. The remi&s;&s;ion of one di&s;ea&s;e will enable nature to combat the re&s;t.&mdash;The &s;quills I have not neglected; for I have taken more than a hundred drops a day, and one day took two hundred and fifty, which, according to the popular equivalence of a drop to a grain, is more than half an ounce.&mdash;I thank you, dear Sir, for your attention in ordering the medicines; your attention to me has never failed. If the virtue of medicines could be enforced by the benevolence of the pre&s;criber, how &s;oon &s;hould I be well."</Q></P>
<P>Augu&s;t 19. <Q REND="inline">"The relaxation of the a&s;thma &s;till continues, yet I do not tru&s;t it wholly to it&s;elf, but &s;oothe it now and then with an opiate. I not only perform the perpetual act of re&s;piration with le&s;s labour, but I can walk with fewer intervals of re&s;t, and with greater freedom of motion.&mdash;I never thought well of Dr. James's compounded medicines; his ingredients appeared to me &s;ometimes inefficacious and trifling, and &s;ometimes heterogeneous and
<PB N="540" REF="542" MS="y">
 de&s;tructive of each other. This pre&s;cription exhibits a compo&s;ition of about three hundred and thirty grains, in which there are four grains of emetick tartar, and &s;ix drops thebaick tincture. He that writes thus, &s;urely writes for &s;how. The ba&s;is of his medicine is the gum ammoniacum, which dear Dr. Lawrence u&s;ed to give, but of which I never &s;aw any effect. We will, if you plea&s;e, let this medicine alone. The &s;quills have every &s;uffrage, and in the &s;quills we will re&s;t for the pre&s;ent."</Q></P>
<P>Augu&s;t 21. <Q REND="inline">"The kindne&s;s which you &s;how by having me in your thoughts upon all occa&s;ions, will, I hope, always fill my heart with gratitude. Be plea&s;ed to return my thanks to Sir George Baker, for the con&s;ideration which he has be&s;towed upon me.&mdash;Is this the balloon that has been &s;o long expected, this balloon to which I &s;ub&s;cribed, but without payment? It is pity that philo&s;ophers have been di&s;appointed, and &s;hame that they have been cheated; but I know not well how to prevent either. Of this experiment I have read nothing; where was it exhibited? and who was the man that ran away with &s;o much money?&mdash;Continue, dear Sir, to write often and more at a time; for none of your pre&s;criptions operate to their proper u&s;es more certainly than your letters operate as cordials."</Q></P>
<P>Augu&s;t 26. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uffered you to e&s;cape la&s;t po&s;t without a letter, but you are not to expect &s;uch indulgence very often, for I write not &s;o much becau&s;e I have any thing to &s;ay, as becau&s;e I hope for an an&s;wer; and the vacancy of my life here makes a letter of great value.&mdash;I have here little company and little amu&s;ement, and thus abandoned to the contemplation of my own mi&s;eries, I am &s;ometimes gloomy and depre&s;&s;ed; this too I re&s;i&s;t as I can, and find opium, I think, u&s;eful, but I &s;eldom take more than one grain.&mdash;Is not this &s;trange weather? Winter ab&s;orbed the &s;pring, and now autumn is come before we have had &s;ummer. But let not our kindne&s;s for each other imitate the incon&s;tancy of the &s;ea&s;ons."</Q></P>
<P>Sept. 2. <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Windham has been here to &s;ee me, he came, I think, forty miles out of his way, and &s;taid about a day and a half, perhaps I make the time &s;horter than it was.

<P>Sept. 9. <Q REND="inline">"Do you know the Duke and Duche&s;s of Devon&s;hire? And have you ever &s;een Chat&s;worth? I was at Chat&s;worth on Monday: I had indeed &s;een it before, but never when its owners were at home; I was very kindly received, and hone&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed to &s;tay, but I told them that a &s;ick man is not a fit inmate of a great hou&s;e. But I hope to go again &s;ome time."</Q></P>
<P>Sept. 11. <Q REND="inline">"I think nothing grows wor&s;e, but all rather better, except &s;leep, and that of late has been at its old pranks. La&s;t evening, I felt what I had not known for a long time, an inclination to walk for amu&s;ement; I took a &s;hort walk, and came back again neither breathle&s;s nor fatigued.&mdash;This has been a gloomy, frigid, ungenial &s;ummer, but of late it &s;eems to mend; I hear the heat &s;ometimes mentioned, but I do not feel it,
<Q><L>'Praeterea minimus gelido jam in corpore &s;anguis</L>
<L>'Febre calet &s;ol&acirc;.'&mdash;</L></Q>
I hope, however, with good help, to find means of &s;upporting a winter at home, and to hear and tell at the Club what is doing, and what ought to be doing in the world. I have no company here, and &s;hall naturally come home hungry for conver&s;ation.&mdash;To wi&s;h you, dear Sir, more lei&s;ure would not be kind; but what lei&s;ure you have, you mu&s;t be&s;tow upon me."</Q></P>
<P>Sept. 16. <Q REND="inline">"I have now let you alone for a long time, having indeed little to &s;ay. You charge me &s;omewhat unju&s;tly with luxury. At Chat&s;worth, you &s;hould remember, that I have eaten but once; and the Doctor, with whom I live, follows a milk diet. I grow no fatter, though my &s;tomach, if it be not di&s;turbed by phy&s;ick, never fails me.&mdash;I now grow weary of &s;olitude, and think of removing next week to Lichfield, a place of more &s;ociety, but otherwi&s;e of le&s;s convenience. When I am &s;ettled, I &s;hall write again.&mdash;Of the hot weather that you mention, we have had in Derby&s;hire very much, and for my&s;elf I &s;eldom feel heat, and &s;uppo&s;e that my frigidity is the effect of my di&s;temper, a &s;uppo&s;ition which naturally leads me to hope that a hotter climate may be u&s;eful. But I hope to &s;tand another Engli&s;h winter."</Q></P>
<P>Lichfield, Sept. 29. <Q REND="inline">"On one day I had three letters about the air|balloon: yours was far the be&s;t, and has enabled me to impart to my friends in the country an idea of this &s;pecies of amu&s;ement.

 give no new intelligence of the &s;tate of the air at different heights, till they have a&s;cended above the height of mountains, which they &s;eem never likely to do.&mdash;I came hither on the 27th. How long I &s;hall &s;tay, I have not deter|mined. My drop&s;y is gone, and my a&s;thma much remitted, but I have felt my&s;elf a little declining the&s;e two days, or at lea&s;t to-day; but &s;uch vici&s;&s;itudes mu&s;t be expected.

<P>October 6. <Q REND="inline">"The fate of the balloon I do not much lament: to make new balloons is to repeat the je&s;t again. We now know a method of mount|ing into the air, and, I think, are not likely to know more. The vehicles can &s;erve no u&s;e till we can guide them; and they can gratify no curio&s;ity till we mount with them to greater heights than we can reach without, till we ri&s;e above the tops of the highe&s;t mountains, which we have yet not done. We know the &s;tate of the air in all its regions, to the top of Teneriffe, and therefore learn nothing from tho&s;e who navigate a balloon below the clouds. The fir&s;t experiment, however, was bold, and de&s;erved applau&s;e and reward.

At A&s;hbourne, where I had very little company, I had the luck to borrow 'Mr. Bowyer's Life;' a book &s;o full of contemporary hi&s;tory, that a literary man mu&s;t find &s;ome of his old friends. I thought that I could now and then have told you &s;ome hints worth your notice; and perhaps we may talk a life over. I hope we &s;hall be much together; you mu&s;t now be to me what you were before, and what dear Mr. Allen was, be&s;ides. He was taken unexpectedly away, but I think he was a very good man.&mdash;I have made little progre&s;s in recovery. I am very weak, and very &s;leeple&s;s; but I live on and hope."</Q></P>
<P>This various ma&s;s of corre&s;pondence, which I have thus brought together, is valuable both as an addition to the &s;tore which the publick already has of John&s;on's writings, and as exhibiting a genuine and noble &s;pecimen of vigour and vivacity of mind, which neither age nor &s;ickne&s;s could impair or dimini&s;h.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved, that his writing in every way, whether for the publick, or privately to his friends, was by fits and &s;tarts; for we &s;ee frequently, that a number of letters are written on the &s;ame day. When he had once over|come his aver&s;ion to begin, he was, I &s;uppo&s;e, de&s;irous to go on in order to relieve his mind from the unea&s;y reflection of delaying what he ought to do.</P>

 While in the country, notwith&s;tanding the accumulation of illne&s;s which he endured, his mind did not lo&s;e its powers.

I &s;hall in&s;ert one of them, which is &s;o wi&s;e and energetick, &s;o philo&s;ophical and &s;o pious, that I doubt not of its affording con&s;olation to many a &s;incere Chri&s;tian, when in a &s;tate of mind to which I believe the be&s;t are &s;ometimes liable <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot"><HI>Again&s;t inqui&s;itive and perplexing thoughts.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"O LORD, my Maker and Protector, who ha&s;t graciou&s;ly &s;ent me into this world to work out my &s;alvation, enable me to drive from me all &s;uch unquiet and perplexing thoughts as may mi&s;lead or hinder me in the practice of tho&s;e duties which Thou ha&s;t required.

<P>And here I am enabled fully to refute a very unju&s;t reflection both again&s;t Dr. John&s;on, and his faithful &s;ervant, Mr. Francis Barber, by Sir John Hawkins, as if both of them had been guilty of culpable neglect towards a per&s;on of the name of Heely, whom Sir John choo&s;es to call a <HI>relation</HI> of Dr. John&s;on's. The fact is, that Mr. Heely was not his relation; he had indeed been married to one of his cou&s;ins, but &s;he had died without having children, and he had married another woman, &s;o that even the &s;light connection which there once had been by <HI>alliance</HI> was di&s;&s;olved.

<P>Indeed it is very nece&s;&s;ary to keep in mind that Sir John Hawkins has unaccountably viewed John&s;on's character and conduct in almo&s;t every par|ticular with an unhappy prejudice <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot"><P>I &s;hall add one in&s;tance only to tho&s;e on which I have thought it incumbent on me to ob&s;erve. Talking of Mr. Garrick's having &s;ignified his willingne&s;s to let John&s;on have the loan of any of his books to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his edition of Shak&s;peare; Sir John &s;ays (page 444) <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Garrick knew not what ri&s;que he ran by this offer.

Sir John mentions the &s;ingle ca&s;e of a curious edition of Politian, which he tells us, <Q REND="inline">"appeared to belong to Pembroke-College, and which, probably, had been con&s;idered by John&s;on as his own, for upwards of fifty years."</Q> Would it not be fairer to con&s;ider this as an inadvertence, and draw no general inference? The truth is, that John&s;on was &s;o attentive, that in one of his manu&s;cripts in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he has marked in two columns books borrowed, and books lent.</P>
<P>In Sir John Hawkins's compilation, there are, however, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages concerning John&s;on which have unque&s;tionable merit. One of them I &s;hall tran&s;cribe, in ju&s;tice to a writer whom I have had too much occa&s;ion to cen&s;ure, and to &s;hew my fairne&s;s as the biographer of my illu&s;trious friend: <Q REND="inline">"There was wanting in his conduct and behaviour, that dignity which re&s;ults from a regular and orderly cour&s;e of action, and by an irre&s;i&s;tible power commands e&s;teem.

His father built the corner-hou&s;e in the Market-place, the two fronts of which, towards Market and Broad-market-&s;treet, &s;tood upon wa&s;te land of the Corporation, under a forty years' lea&s;e, which was then expired. On the 15th of Augu&s;t, 1767, at a common-hall of the bailiffs and citizens, it was ordered (and that without any &s;ollicitation) that a lea&s;e &s;hould be granted to Samuel John&s;on, Doctor of Laws, of the incroachments at his hou&s;e, for the term of ninety-nine years, at the old rent, which was five &s;hillings. Of which, as Town-Clerk, Mr. Simp&s;on had the honour and plea&s;ure of informing him, and that he was de&s;ired to accept it, without paying any fine on the occa&s;ion, which lea&s;e was afterwards granted, and the Doctor died po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this property."</Q></NOTE>! While here, he felt a revival of all the
<PB N="552" REF="554" MS="y">
 tenderne&s;s of filial affection, an in&s;tance of which appeared in his ordering the grave-&s;tone and in&s;cription, over Elizabeth Blaney <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Vol. I. p. 9.</NOTE>, to be &s;ub&s;tantially and carefully renewed.</P>
<P>To Mr. Henry White, a young clergyman, with whom he now formed an intimacy, &s;o as to talk to him with great freedom, he mentioned that he could not in general accu&s;e him&s;elf of having been an undutiful &s;on. <Q REND="inline">"Once, indeed (&s;aid he) I was di&s;obedient; I refu&s;ed to attend my father to Uttoxeter-market. Pride was the &s;ource of that refu&s;al, and the remembrance of it was painful. A few years ago, I de&s;ired to atone for this fault; I went to Uttoxeter in very bad weather, and &s;tood for a con&s;iderable time bare-headed in the rain, on the &s;pot where my father's &s;tall u&s;ed to &s;tand. In contrition I &s;tood, and I hope the pennance was expiatory."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I told him (&s;ays Mi&s;s Seward) in one of my late&s;t vi&s;its to him, of a won|derful learned pig, which I had &s;een at Nottingham; and which did all that we have ob&s;erved exhibited by dogs and hor&s;es. The &s;ubject amu&s;ed him. 'Then (&s;aid he) the pigs are a race unju&s;tly calumniated. <HI>Pig</HI> has, it &s;eems, <HI>not</HI> been wanting to <HI>man,</HI> but <HI>man</HI> to <HI>pig.</HI> We do not allow <HI>time</HI> for his education, we kill him at a year old.' Mr. Henry White, who was pre&s;ent, ob&s;erved that if this in&s;tance had happened in or before Pope's time, he would not have been ju&s;tified in in&s;tancing the &s;wine as the lowe&s;t degree of groveling in&s;tinct. Doctor John&s;on &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the ob&s;ervation, while the per&s;on who made it proceeded to remark, that great torture mu&s;t have been employed, ere the indocility of the animal could have been &s;ubdued.&mdash;'Certainly (&s;aid the Doctor) but (turning to me); how old is your pig?' I told him three years old. 'Then (&s;aid he) the pig has no cau&s;e to complain; he would have been killed the fir&s;t year if he had not been <HI>educated,</HI> and pro|tracted exi&s;tence is a good recompence for very con&s;iderable degrees of torture."</Q></P>
<P>As John&s;on had now very faint hopes of recovery, and as Mrs. Thrale was no longer devoted to him, it might have been &s;uppo&s;ed that he would naturally have cho&s;en to remain in the comfortable hou&s;e of his beloved wife's daughter, and end his life where he began it. But there was in him an animated and lofty &s;pirit <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. Burke &s;ugge&s;ted to me as applicable to John&s;on, what Cicero, in his</HI> Cato Major, <HI>&s;ays of</HI> Appius, <Q REND="inline">"Intentum enim animum tanquam arcum habebat, nec langue&s;cens &s;uccumbebat &s;enectuti;"</Q> <HI>repeating at the &s;ame time, the following noble words in the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age:</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Ita enim &s;enectus hone&s;ta e&s;t &s;i &s;e ip&s;a defendit, &s;i jus &s;uum retinet, &s;i uemini emancipata e&s;t, &s;i u&s;que ad extremum vitae &s;piritum vindicet jus &s;uum."</Q></NOTE>, and however complicated di&s;ea&s;es might depre&s;s
<PB N="553" REF="555" MS="y">
ordinary mortals, all who &s;aw him, beheld and acknowledged the <HI>invictum animum Catonis.</HI> Such was his intellectual ardour even at this time, that he &s;aid to one friend, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I look upon every day to be lo&s;t in which I do not make a new acquaintance."</Q> And to another, when talking of his illne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"I will be conquered; I will not capitulate."</Q> And &s;uch was his love of London, &s;o high a reli&s;h had he of its magnificent extent, and variety of intellectual entertainment, that he langui&s;hed when ab&s;ent from it, his mind having become quite luxurious from the long habit of enjoying the metropolis; and therefore although at Lichfield, &s;urrounded with friends, who loved and revered him, and for whom he had a very &s;incere affection, he &s;till found that &s;uch conver&s;ation as London affords, could be found no where el&s;e. The&s;e feelings, joined probably to &s;ome flattering hopes of aid, from the eminent phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons in London, who kindly and generou&s;ly attended him without accepting of fees, made him re&s;olve to return to the capital.</P>
<P>From Lichfield he came to Birmingham, where he pa&s;&s;ed a few days with his worthy old &s;choolfellow, Mr. Hector, who thus writes to me: <Q REND="inline">"He was very &s;olicitous with me to recollect &s;ome of our mo&s;t early tran&s;actions, and tran&s;mit them to him, for I perceived nothing gave him greater plea&s;ure than calling to mind tho&s;e days of our innocence. I complied with his reque&s;t, and he only received them a few days before his death. I have tran&s;cribed for your in&s;pection, exactly the minutes I wrote to him."</Q> This paper having been found in his repo&s;itories after his death, Sir John Hawkins has in&s;erted it entire, and I have made occa&s;ional u&s;e of it, and other communications from Mr. Hector, in the cour&s;e of this work. I have both vi&s;ited and cor|re&s;ponded with him &s;ince Dr. John&s;on's death, and by a&s;king a great variety of particulars have obtained additional information. I followed the &s;ame mode with the Reverend Dr. Taylor, in who&s;e pre&s;ence I wrote down a good deal of what he could tell; and he, at my reque&s;t, &s;igned his name, to give it authenticity. It is very rare to find any per&s;on who is able to give a di&s;tinct account of the life even of one whom he has known intimately, without que&s;tions being put to them. My friend, Dr. Kippis, has told me, that on this account it is a practice with him to draw out a biographical catechi&s;m.</P>
<P>John&s;on then proceeded to Oxford, where he was again kindly received by Dr. Adams, who was plea&s;ed to give me the following account in one of his letters (17th Feb. 1785): <Q REND="inline">"His la&s;t vi&s;it was, I believe, to my hou&s;e, which he left after a &s;tay of four or five days. We had much &s;erious talk together, for which I ought to be the better as long as I live. You will remember &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e which we had in the &s;ummer upon the &s;ubject of prayer, and
<PB N="554" REF="556" MS="y">
 the difficulty of this &s;ort of compo&s;ition. He reminded me of this, and of my having wi&s;hed him to try his hand, and to give us a &s;pecimen of the &s;tyle and manner that he approved. He added, that he was now in a right frame of mind, and as he could not po&s;&s;ibly employ his time better, he would in earne&s;t &s;et about it. But I find upon enquiry, that no papers of this &s;ort were left behind him, except a few &s;hort ejaculatory forms &s;uitable to his pre&s;ent &s;ituation."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Adams had not then received accurate information on this &s;ubject; for it has &s;ince appeared that various prayers had been compo&s;ed by him at different periods, which intermingled with pious re&s;olutions, and &s;ome &s;hort notes of his life, were entitled by him <Q REND="inline">"Prayers and Meditations,"</Q> and have in pur&s;uance of his earne&s;t requi&s;ition in the hopes of doing good, been pub|li&s;hed, with a judicious well-written Preface, by the Reverend Mr. Strahan, to whom he delivered them. This admirable collection, to which I have frequently referred in the cour&s;e of this work, evinces, beyond all his compo&s;itions for the publick, and all the eulogies of his friends and admirers, the &s;incere virtue and piety of John&s;on. It proves with unque&s;tion|able authenticity, that amid&s;t all his con&s;titutional infirmities, his earne&s;tne&s;s to conform his practice to the precepts of Chri&s;tianity was uncea&s;ing, and that he habitually endeavoured to refer every tran&s;action of his life to the will of the Supreme Being.</P>
<P>He arrived in London on the 16th of November, and next day &s;ent to Dr. Burney, the following note, which I in&s;ert as the la&s;t token of his re|membrance of this ingenious and amiable man, and as another of the many proofs of the tenderne&s;s and benignity of his heart.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"MR. JOHNSON, who came home la&s;t night, &s;ends his re&s;pects to dear Dr. Burney, and all the dear Burneys, little and great."</Q></P>

His corre&s;pondence with me after his letter on the &s;ubject of my &s;ettling  in London, &s;hall now &s;o far as is proper, be produced in one &s;eries.</P>
<P>July 26, he wrote to me from A&s;hbourne; <Q REND="inline">"On the 14th I came to Lichfield, and found every body glad enough to &s;ee me. On the 20th, I came hither, and found a hou&s;e half built, of very uncomfortable appearance, but my own room has not been altered. That a man worn with di&s;ea&s;es, in his &s;eventy-&s;econd or third year, &s;hould condemn part of his remaining life to pa&s;s among ruins and rubbi&s;h, and that no incon&s;iderable part, appears to me very &s;trange.&mdash;I know that your kindne&s;s makes you impatient to know the &s;tate of my health, in which I cannot boa&s;t of much improvement. I came through the journey without much inconvenience, but when I attempt &s;elf-motion I find my legs weak, and my breath very &s;hort; this day I have been much di&s;ordered. I have no company; the Doctor is bu&s;y in his fields, and goes to bed at nine, and his whole &s;y&s;tem is &s;o different from mine, that we &s;eem formed for different elements; I have, therefore, all my amu&s;e|ment to &s;eek within my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>Having written to him in bad &s;pirits, a letter filled with dejection and fretfulne&s;s, and at the &s;ame time expre&s;&s;ing anxious apprehen&s;ions concerning him, on account of a dream which had di&s;turbed me; his an&s;wer was chiefly in terms of reproach, for a &s;uppo&s;ed charge of <Q REND="inline">"affecting di&s;content, and indulging the vanity of complaint."</Q> It however proceeded, <Q REND="inline">"Write to me often, and write like a man. I con&s;ider your fidelity and tenderne&s;s as a great part of the comforts which are yet left me, and &s;incerely wi&s;h we could be nearer to each other.&mdash;* * * * * * * *.&mdash;My dear friend, life is very &s;hort and very uncertain; let us &s;pend it as well as we can.&mdash;My worthy neigh|bour, Allen, is dead. Love me as well as you can. Pay my re&s;pects to dear Mrs. Bo&s;well.&mdash;Nothing ailed me at that time; let your &s;uper&s;tition at la&s;t have an end."</Q></P>
<P>Feeling very &s;oon, that the manner in which he had written might hurt me, he in two days after, July 28, wrote to me again, giving me an account of his &s;ufferings, after which follows: <Q REND="inline">"Before this letter you will have had one which I hope you will not take ami&s;s; for it contains only truth, and that truth kindly intended. * * * * * * *. <HI>Spartam quam nactus es orna;</HI> make the mo&s;t and be&s;t of your lot, and compare your&s;elf not with the few that are above you, but with the multitudes which are below you. * * * * * *. Go &s;teadily forward with lawful bu&s;ine&s;s or hone&s;t diver&s;ions. <HI>'Be</HI> (as Temple &s;ays of the Dutchmen) <HI>well when you are not ill, and plea&s;ed when you are not angry.'</HI> * * * * * *. This may &s;eem but an ill return for your tenderne&s;s; but I mean it well, for I love you with great ardour and
<PB N="556" REF="558" MS="y">
 &s;incerity. Pay my re&s;pects to dear Mrs. Bo&s;well, and teach the young ones to love me."</Q></P>
<P>I unfortunately was &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed during a con&s;iderable part of the year, that it was not, or at lea&s;t I thought it was not, in my power to write to my illu&s;trious friend as formerly, or without expre&s;&s;ing &s;uch complaints as offended him. Having conjured him not to do me the inju&s;tice of charging me with affectation, I was with much regret long &s;ilent. His la&s;t letter to me then came, and affected me very tenderly:
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this &s;ummer &s;ometimes amended and &s;ometimes relap&s;ed, but upon the whole, have lo&s;t ground very much. My legs are extremely weak, and my breath very &s;hort, and the water is now encrea&s;ing upon me. In this uncomfortable &s;tate your letters u&s;ed to relieve; what is the rea&s;on that I have them no longer? Are you &s;ick, or are you &s;ullen? Whatever be the rea&s;on, if it be le&s;s than nece&s;&s;ity, drive it away, and of the &s;hort life that we have, make the be&s;t u&s;e for your&s;elf and for your friends. * * * * * *. I am &s;ometimes afraid that your omi&s;&s;ion to write has &s;ome real cau&s;e, and &s;hall be glad to know that you are not &s;ick, and that nothing ill has befallen dear Mrs. Bo&s;well, or any of your family.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>Yet it was not a little painful to me to find, that in a paragraph of this letter, which I have omitted, he &s;till per&s;evered in arraigning me as before, which was &s;trange in him who had &s;o much experience of what I &s;uffered. I however wrote to him two as kind letters as I could; the la&s;t of which came too late to be read by him, for his illne&s;s encrea&s;ed more rapidly upon him than I had apprehended; but I had the con&s;olation of being informed that he &s;poke of me on his death-bed, with affection, and I look forward with humble hope of renewing our friend&s;hip in a better world.</P>
<P>I now relieve the readers of this work from any farther per&s;onal notice of its authour, who if he &s;hould be thought to have obtruded him&s;elf too much upon their attention, reque&s;ts them to con&s;ider the peculiar plan of his biographical undertaking.</P>
<P>Soon after John&s;on's return to the metropolis, both the a&s;thma and drop&s;y became more violent and di&s;tre&s;sful. He had for &s;ome time kept a journal in Latin, of the &s;tate of his illne&s;s, and the remedies which he u&s;ed, under the
<PB N="557" REF="559">
title of <HI>Aegri Ephemeris,</HI> which he began on the 6th of July, but continued it no  longer than the 8th of November; finding, I &s;uppo&s;e, that it was a mournful and unavailing regi&s;ter. It is in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and is written with great care and accuracy.</P>
<P>Still his love of literature <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><P>It is truly wonderful to con&s;ider the extent and con&s;tancy of John&s;on's literary ardour, not|with&s;tanding the melancholy which clouded and embittered his exi&s;tence.

<P>John&s;on's extraordinary facility of compo&s;ition, when he &s;hook off his con&s;titutional indolence, and re&s;olutely &s;ate down to write, is admirably de&s;cribed by Mr. Courtenay, in his <Q REND="inline">"Poetical Review,"</Q> which I have &s;everal times quoted:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"While through life's maze he &s;ent a piercing view,</L>
<L>"His mind expan&s;ive to the object grew.</L>
<L>"With various &s;tores of erudition fraught,</L>
<L>"The lively image, the deep-&s;earching thought,</L>
<L>"Slept in repo&s;e;&mdash;but when the moment pre&s;s'd,</L>
<L>"The bright ideas &s;tood at once confe&s;s'd;</L>
<L>"In&s;tant his genius &s;ped its vigorous rays,</L>
<L>"And o'er the letter'd world diffus'd a blaze:</L>
<L>"As womb'd with fire the cloud electrick flies,</L>
<L>"And calmly o'er th' horizon &s;eems to ri&s;e;</L>
<L>"Touch'd by the pointed &s;teel, the lightning flows,</L>
<L>"And all th' expan&s;e with rich effulgence glows."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>We &s;hall in vain endeavour to know with exact preci&s;ion every production of John&s;on's pen. He owned to me, that he had written about forty &s;ermons; but as I under&s;tood that he had given or &s;old them to different per&s;ons, who were to preach them as their own, he did not con&s;ider him&s;elf at liberty to acknowledge them. Would tho&s;e who were thus aided by him, who are &s;till alive, and the friends of tho&s;e who are dead, fairly inform the world, it would be obligingly gratifying a rea&s;onable curio&s;ity, to which there &s;hould, I think, now be no objection.&mdash;I have lying before me, in his hand-writing, a fragment of twenty quarto leaves, of a tran&s;lation into Engli&s;h of Sallu&s;t, <HI>De Bello Catalinario.</HI> When it was done I have no notion; but it &s;eems to have no very &s;uperiour merit to mark it as his. Be&s;ides tho&s;e publications, which with all my chronological care I have a&s;certained in the cour&s;e of this work, I am &s;atisfied, from internal evidence, to admit al&s;o as genuine the following:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Con&s;iderations on the Ca&s;e of Dr. Trapp's Sermons,&dagger;"</Q> publi&s;hed in 1739, in the Gentle|man's Magazine. It is a very ingenious defence of the right of <HI>abridging</HI> an authour's work, without being held as infringing his property. This is one of the nice&s;t que&s;tions in the <HI>Law of Literature;</HI> and I cannot help thinking, that the indulgence of abridging is often exceedingly injurious to authours and book&s;ellers, and &s;hould in very few ca&s;es be permitted.</P>
<P>Dedication for Mrs. Lennox to the Earl of Middle&s;ex, of her <Q REND="inline">"Female Quixote,"</Q> in 1762.&dagger;</P>
<P>Preface to the Catalogue of the Arti&s;ts' Exhibition in 1762.&dagger;</P>
<P>Preface to Baretti's <Q REND="inline">"Ea&s;y Le&s;&s;ons in Italian and Engli&s;h,"</Q> in 1775.&dagger;</P>
<P>But, though it has been confidently a&s;cribed to him, I cannot allow that he wrote a Dedication to both Hou&s;es of Parliament of a book entitled <Q REND="inline">"The Evangelical Hi&s;tory Harmonized,"</Q> He was no <HI>croaker;</HI> no declaimer again&s;t <HI>the times.</HI> He would not have written, <Q REND="inline">"That we are fallen upon an age in which corruption is not barely univer&s;al, is univer&s;ally confe&s;&s;ed."</Q> Nor, <Q REND="inline">"Rapine preys on the publick without oppo&s;ition, and perjury betrays it without inquiry."</Q> Nor would he, to excite a &s;peedy reformation, have conjured up &s;uch phantoms of terrour as the&s;e: <Q REND="inline">"A few years longer, and perhaps all endeavours will be in vain. We may be &s;wallowed by an earthquake; we may be delivered to our enemies."</Q> This is not John&s;onian.</P>
<P>There are indeed, in this Dedication, &s;everal &s;entences con&s;tructed upon the model of tho&s;e of John&s;on. But the imitation of the form, without the &s;pirit of his &s;tyle, has been &s;o general, that this of it&s;elf is not &s;ufficient evidence. Even our news-paper writers a&s;pire to it. In an account of the funeral of Edwin the comedian, in <Q REND="inline">"The Diary"</Q> of Nov. 9, 1790, that &s;on of drollery is thus de&s;cribed: <Q REND="inline">"A man who had &s;o often cheered the &s;ullenne&s;s of vacancy, and &s;u&s;pended the approaches of &s;orrow."</Q></P>

 During his &s;leeple&s;s nights he amu&s;ed him&s;elf by tran&s;lating into Latin ver&s;e, from the Greek, many of the epigrams in the <HI>Anthologia.</HI> The&s;e tran&s;lations, with &s;ome other poems by him in Latin, he gave to his friend Mr. Langton, who, having added a few notes, &s;old them to the book&s;ellers for a &s;mall &s;um, to be given to &s;ome of John&s;on's relations, which was accordingly done; and they are printed in the collection of his works.</P>
<P>A very erroneous notion has circulated as to John&s;on's deficiency in the knowledge of the Greek language, partly owing to the mode&s;ty with which, from knowing how much there was to be learnt, he u&s;ed to mention his own comparative acqui&s;itions. When Mr. Cumberland<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cumberland a&s;&s;ures me, that he was always treated with great courte&s;y by Dr. John&s;on, who, in his <Q REND="inline">"Letters to Mrs. Thrale,"</Q> Vol. II. p. 68, thus &s;peaks of that learned, ingenious, and accompli&s;hed gentleman: <Q REND="inline">"The want of company is an inconvenience: but Mr. Cumberland is a million."</Q></NOTE> talked to him of the Greek fragments which are &s;o well illu&s;trated in <Q REND="inline">"The Ob&s;erver,"</Q> and of the Greek dramati&s;ts in general, he candidly acknowledged his in&s;ufficiency in that particular branch of Greek literature. Yet it may be &s;aid, that though not a great, he was a good Greek &s;cholar. Mr. Burney, who is univer&s;ally acknowledged by the be&s;t judges, to be one of the few men of this age who are very eminent for their &s;kill in that noble language, has a&s;&s;ured me, that John&s;on could give a Greek word for almo&s;t every Engli&s;h one; and that although not &s;ufficiently conver&s;ant in the niceties of the language, he upon &s;ome occa&s;ions di&s;covered, even in the&s;e, a con&s;iderable degree of critical acumen. Mr. Dalzell, Profe&s;&s;or of Greek at Edinburgh, who&s;e &s;kill in it is unque&s;tion|able, mentioned to me, in very liberal terms, the impre&s;&s;ion which was made upon him by John&s;on, in a conver&s;ation which they had in London concerning that language. As John&s;on, therefore, was undoubtedly one of the fir&s;t Latin &s;cholars in modern times, let us not deny to his fame &s;ome additional &s;plendour from Greek.</P>

I &s;hall now fulfil my promi&s;e of exhibiting &s;pecimens of various &s;orts of  imitation of John&s;on's &s;tyle.</P>
<P>In the <Q REND="inline">"Tran&s;actions of the Royal Iri&s;h Academy, 1787,"</Q> there is an <Q REND="inline">"E&s;&s;ay on the Style of Dr. Samuel John&s;on,"</Q> by the Rev.

<P>Mr. BURROWES has analy&s;ed the compo&s;ition of John&s;on, and pointed out its peculiarities with much acutene&s;s; and I would recommend a careful peru&s;al of his E&s;&s;ay to tho&s;e, who being captivated by the union of per&s;picuity and &s;plendour which the writings of John&s;on contain, without having a &s;uf|ficient portion of his vigour of mind, may be in danger of becoming bad copyi&s;ts of his manner. I however cannot but ob&s;erve, and I ob&s;erve it to his credit, that this learned gentleman has him&s;elf caught no mean degree of the expan&s;ion and harmony which, independent of all other circum&s;tances, characteri&s;e the &s;entences of John&s;on. Thus, in the Preface to the volume in which his E&s;&s;ay appears, we find, <Q REND="inline">"If it be &s;aid that in &s;ocieties of this &s;ort, too much attention is frequently be&s;towed on &s;ubjects barren and &s;pecu|lative, it may be an&s;wered, that no one &s;cience is &s;o little connected with the re&s;t, as not to afford many principles who&s;e u&s;e may extend con&s;iderably beyond the &s;cience to which they primarily belong; and that no propo&s;ition is &s;o purely theoretical as to be totally incapable of being applied to practical purpo&s;es. There is no apparent connection between duration and the cycloidal arch, the properties of which duly attended to, have furni&s;hed us with our be&s;t regulated methods of mea&s;uring time: and he who has made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the nature and affections of the logarithmick curve, is not aware that he has advanced con&s;iderably towards a&s;certaining the proportionable den&s;ity of the air at its various di&s;tances from the &s;urface of the earth."</Q></P>

 The ludicrous imitators of John&s;on's &s;tyle are innumerable. Their general method is to accumulate hard words, without con&s;idering, that although he was fond of introducing them occa&s;ionally, there is not a &s;ingle &s;entence in all his writings where they are crowded together, as in the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the following imaginary Ode by him to Mrs. Thrale <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">John&s;on's wi&s;hing to unite him&s;elf with this rich widow was much talked of, but I believe without foundation. The report, however, gave occa&s;ion for a poem, not without characteri&s;tical merit, entitled, <Q REND="inline">"Ode to Mrs. Thrale, by Samuel John&s;on, LL.

<P>In an enlightened and improving age, much perhaps is not to be appre|hended from the inroads of mere caprice; at &s;uch a period it will generally be perceived, that needle&s;s irregularity is the wor&s;t of all deformities, and that nothing is &s;o truly elegant in language as the &s;implicity of unviolated analogy.&mdash;Rules will therefore be ob&s;erved, &s;o far as they are known and acknowledged: but, at the &s;ame time, the de&s;ire of improvement having been once excited will not remain inactive; and its efforts, unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted by knowledge, as much as they are prompted by zeal, will not unfrequently be found pernicious; &s;o that the very per&s;ons who&s;e intention it is to perfect the in&s;trument of rea&s;on, will deprave and di&s;order it unknowingly.

<P>But I think the mo&s;t perfect imitation of John&s;on is a profe&s;&s;ed one, entitled <Q REND="inline">"A Critici&s;m on Gray's Elegy in a Country Church-yard,"</Q> &s;aid to be written by Mr. YOUNG, Profe&s;&s;or of Greek at Gla&s;gow, and of which let him have the credit, unle&s;s a better title can be &s;hewn.

<P>Yet whatever merit there may be in any imitations of John&s;on's &s;tyle, every good judge mu&s;t &s;ee that they are obviou&s;ly different from the original; for all of them are either deficient in its force, or overloaded with its pecu|liarities; and the powerful &s;entiment to which it is &s;uited is not to be found.</P>

<Q><P>You know (&s;ays he <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Letters to Mrs. Thrale,"</Q> Vol. II. p. 350.</NOTE>) I never thought confidence with re&s;pect to futurity any part of the character of a brave, a wife, or a good man. Bravery has no place where it can avail nothing; wi&s;dom impre&s;&s;es &s;trongly the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of tho&s;e faults, of which it is perhaps it&s;elf an aggravation; and goodne&s;s, always wi&s;hing to be better, and imputing every deficience to criminal negligence, and every fault to voluntary corruption, never dares to &s;uppo&s;e the condition of forgivene&s;s fulfilled, nor what is wanting in the crime &s;upplied by penitence.</P>
<P>This is the &s;tate of the be&s;t; but what mu&s;t be the condition of him who&s;e heart will not &s;uffer him to rank him&s;elf among the be&s;t, or among the good? Such mu&s;t be his dread of the approaching trial, as will leave him little attention to the opinion of tho&s;e whom he is leaving for ever; and the &s;erenity that is not felt, it can be no virtue to feign.</P></Q>
<P>His great fear of death, and the &s;trange dark manner in which Sir John Hawkins imparts the unea&s;ine&s;s which he expre&s;&s;ed on account of offences with which he charged him&s;elf, may give occa&s;ion to injurious &s;u&s;picions, as if there had been &s;omething of more than ordinary criminality weighing upon his con&s;cience. On that account, therefore, as well as from the regard to truth which he inculcated <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">See what he &s;aid to Mr. Malone, p. 356 of this volume.</NOTE>, I am to mention, (with all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect and
<PB N="568" REF="570" MS="y">
 delicacy however,) that his conduct after he came to London, and had a&s;&s;ociated with Savage and others, was not &s;o &s;trictly virtuous, in one re&s;pect, as when he was a younger man. It was well known, that his amorous incli|nations were uncommonly &s;trong and impetuous. He owned to many of his friends, that he u&s;ed to take women of the town to taverns, and hear them relate their hi&s;tory. In &s;hort, it mu&s;t not be concealed, that like many other good and pious men, among&s;t whom we may place the Apo&s;tle Paul, upon his own authority, John&s;on was not free from propen&s;ities which were ever <Q REND="inline">"warring again&s;t the law of his mind,"</Q>&mdash;and that in his combats with them, he was &s;ometimes overcome.</P>
<P>Here let the profane and licentious pau&s;e;&mdash;let them not thoughtle&s;sly &s;ay that John&s;on was an <HI>hypocrite,</HI> or that his <HI>principles</HI> were not firm, becau&s;e his <HI>practice</HI> was not uniformly conformable to what he profe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Let the que&s;tion be con&s;idered independent of moral and religious a&s;&s;ocia|tion; and no man will deny that thou&s;ands, in many in&s;tances, act again&s;t conviction. Is a prodigal, for example, an <HI>hypocrite,</HI> when he owns he is &s;atisfied that his extravagance will bring him to ruin and mi&s;ery? We are <HI>&s;ure</HI> he <HI>believes</HI> it; but immediate inclination, &s;trengthened by indulgence, prevails over that belief in influencing his conduct. Why then &s;hall credit be refu&s;ed to the <HI>&s;incerity</HI> of tho&s;e who acknowledge their per&s;ua&s;ion of moral and religious duty, yet &s;ometimes fail of living as it requires? I heard Dr. John&s;on once ob&s;erve, <Q REND="inline">"There is &s;omething noble in publi&s;hing truth, though it condemns one's &s;elf <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</Q> 3d edit. p. 209.</NOTE>."</Q> And one who &s;aid in his pre&s;ence, <Q REND="inline">"he had no notion of people being in earne&s;t in their good profe&s;&s;ions, who&s;e practice was not &s;uitable to them,"</Q> was thus reprimanded by him:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sir, are you &s;o gro&s;sly ignorant of human nature as not to know that a man may be very &s;incere in good principles, without having good practice <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 374.</NOTE>?"</Q></P>
<P>But let no man encourage or &s;oothe him&s;elf in <Q REND="inline">"pre&s;umptuous &s;in,"</Q> from knowing that John&s;on was &s;ometimes hurried into indulgences which he thought criminal. I have exhibited this circum&s;tance as a &s;hade in &s;o great a character, both from my &s;acred love of truth, and to &s;hew that he was not &s;o weakly &s;crupulous as he has been repre&s;ented by tho&s;e who imagine that the &s;ins of which a deep &s;en&s;e was upon his mind, were merely &s;uch little venial trifles as pouring milk into his tea on Good-Friday. His under|&s;tanding
<PB N="569" REF="571">
will be defended by my &s;tatement, if his con&s;i&s;tency of conduct  be in &s;ome degree impaired. But what wi&s;e man would, for momentary grati|fications, deliberately &s;ubject him&s;elf to &s;uffer &s;uch unea&s;ine&s;s as we find was experienced by John&s;on in reviewing his conduct as compared with his notion of the ethicks of the go&s;pel? Let the following pa&s;&s;ages be kept in remembrance:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"O GOD, giver and pre&s;erver of all life, by who&s;e power I was created, and by who&s;e providence I am &s;u&s;tained, look down upon me with tenderne&s;s and mercy; grant that I may not have been created to be finally de&s;troyed; that I may not be pre&s;erved to add wickedne&s;s to wicked|ne&s;s <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Prayers and Meditations,"</Q> p. 47.</NOTE>."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"O LORD, let me not &s;ink into total depravity; look down upon me, and re&s;cue me at la&s;t from the captivity of &s;in <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 68.</NOTE>."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Almighty and mo&s;t merciful Father, who ha&s;t continued my life from year to year, grant that by longer life I may become le&s;s de&s;irous of &s;inful plea&s;ures, and more careful of eternal happine&s;s <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 84.</NOTE>."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Let not my years be multiplied to increa&s;e my guilt; but as my age advances, let me become more pure in my thoughts, more regular in my de&s;ires, and more obedient to thy laws <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 120.</NOTE>."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Forgive, O merciful LORD, whatever I have done contrary to thy laws. Give me &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of my wickedne&s;s as may produce true contrition and effectual repentance; &s;o that when I &s;hall be called into another &s;tate, I may be received among the &s;inners to whom &s;orrow and reformation have obtained pardon, for JESUS CHRIST'S &s;ake. Amen <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 130.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Such was the di&s;tre&s;s of mind, &s;uch the penitence of John&s;on in his hours of privacy, and in his devout approaches to his Maker. His <HI>&s;incerity</HI> there|fore mu&s;t appear to every candid mind unque&s;tionable.</P>
<P>It is of e&s;&s;ential con&s;equence to keep in view, that there was in this excel|lent man's conduct no fal&s;e principle of <HI>commutation,</HI> no <HI>deliberate</HI> indulgence in &s;in, in con&s;ideration of a counterbalance of duty. His offending, and his repenting, were di&s;tinct and &s;eparate <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Dr. John&s;on related, with an earne&s;tne&s;s of approbation, a &s;tory of a gentleman, who, in an impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, overcame the virtue of a young woman. When &s;he &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"I am afraid we have done wrong!"</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, we have done wrong;&mdash;for I would not <HI>debauch her mind.</HI>"</Q></NOTE>: and when we con&s;ider his almo&s;t unexampled attention to truth, his inflexible integrity, his con&s;tant piety, who will dare to <Q REND="inline">"ca&s;t a &s;tone"</Q> at him?

<PB N="570" REF="572">
 thing di&s;hone&s;t, ba&s;e, or malignant; but that, on the contrary, he was charitable in an extraordinary degree: &s;o that even in one of his own rigid judgements of him&s;elf, (Ea&s;ter-eve, 1781,) while he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"I have corrected no external habits;"</Q> he is obliged to own, <Q REND="inline">"I hope that &s;ince my la&s;t communion I have advanced by pious reflections in my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to GOD, and my benevolence to man <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Prayers and Meditations,"</Q> p. 192.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>I am con&s;cious that this is the mo&s;t difficult and dangerous part of my biographical work, and I cannot but be very anxious concerning it. I tru&s;t that I have got through it, pre&s;erving at once my regard to truth&mdash;to my friend&mdash;and to the intere&s;ts of virtue and religion. Nor can I apprehend that more harm can en&s;ue from the knowledge of the irregularity of John&s;on, guarded as I have &s;tated it, than from knowing that Addi&s;on and Parnell were intemperate in the u&s;e of wine; which John&s;on him&s;elf, in his Lives of tho&s;e celebrated writers, and pious men, has not forborne to record.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to give a very minute detail of the particulars of John&s;on's remaining days, of whom it it was now evident, that the cri&s;is was fa&s;t approaching, when he mu&s;t <Q REND="inline">"die like men, and fall like one of the Princes."</Q> Yet it will be in&s;tructive, as well as gratifying to the curio&s;ity of my readers, to record a few circum&s;tances, on the authenticity of which they may per|fectly rely, as I have been at the utmo&s;t pains to obtain them from the be&s;t authority.</P>
<P>Dr. Heberden, Dr. Brockle&s;by, Dr. Warren, and Dr. Butter, phy&s;icians, generou&s;ly attended him, without accepting of any fees, as did Mr. Cruik&s;hank, &s;urgeon; and all that could be done from profe&s;&s;ional &s;kill and ability was tried, to prolong a life &s;o truly valuable. He him&s;elf, indeed, having on account of his very bad con&s;titution been perpetually applying him&s;elf to medical inquiries, united his own efforts with tho&s;e of the gentlemen who attended him; and imagining that the drop&s;ical collection of water which oppre&s;&s;ed him, might be drawn off, by making inci&s;ions in his body, he, with his u&s;ual re&s;olute defiance of pain, cut deep, when he thought that his &s;urgeon had done it too tenderly <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This bold experiment, Sir John Hawkins has related in &s;uch a manner as to &s;ugge&s;t a charge again&s;t John&s;on of intentionally ha&s;tening his end; a charge &s;o very incon&s;i&s;tent with his character in every re&s;pect, that it is injurious even to refute it, as Sir John has thought it nece&s;|&s;ary to do. It is evident, that what John&s;on did in hopes of relief indicated an extraordinary eagerne&s;s to retard his di&s;&s;olution.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="571" REF="573" MS="y">
About eight or ten days before his death, when Dr. Brockle&s;by paid him  his morning vi&s;it, he &s;eemed very low and de&s;ponding, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I have been as a dying man all night."</Q> He then emphatically broke out, in the words of Shak&s;peare,</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Can'&s;t thou not mini&s;ter to a mind di&s;eas'd?</L>
<L>"Pluck from the memory a rooted &s;orrow?</L>
<L>"Raze out the written troubles of the brain?</L>
<L>"And with &s;ome &s;weet oblivious antidote,</L>
<L>"Clean&s;e the full bo&s;om of that perilous &s;tuff,</L>
<L>"Which weighs upon the heart."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>To which Dr. Brockle&s;by readily an&s;wered from the &s;ame great poet:
<Q><L>"&mdash;therein the patient</L>
<L>"Mu&s;t mini&s;ter unto him&s;elf."</L></Q>
John&s;on expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf much &s;atisfied with the application.</P>
<P>On another day after this, when talking on the &s;ubject of prayer, Dr. Brockle&s;by repeated from Juvenal,
<Q><L>"Orandum e&s;t ut &s;it mens &s;ana in corpore &s;ano,"</L></Q>
and &s;o on to the end of the tenth &s;atire; but in running it quickly over he happened in the line
<Q><L>"Qui &s;patium vitae extremum inter munera ponat,"</L></Q>
to pronounce <HI>&s;upremum</HI> for <HI>extremum;</HI> at which John&s;on's critical ear in&s;tantly took offence, and di&s;cour&s;ing vehemently on the unmetrical effect of &s;uch a lap&s;e, he &s;hewed him&s;elf as full as ever of the &s;pirit of the grammarian.</P>
<P>Having no near relations, it had been for &s;ome time John&s;on's intention to make a liberal provi&s;ion for his faithful &s;ervant, Mr. Francis Barber, whom he looked upon as particularly under his protection, and whom he had all along treated truly as an humble friend. Having a&s;ked Dr. Brockle&s;by what would be a proper annuity to bequeath to a favourite &s;ervant, and being an&s;wered that it mu&s;t depend on the circum&s;tances of the ma&s;ter; and that in the cafe of a nobleman fifty pounds a year was con&s;idered as an adequate reward for many years faithful &s;ervice. <Q REND="inline">"Then (&s;aid John&s;on) &s;hall I be <HI>nobili&s;&s;imus,</HI> for I mean to leave Frank &s;eventy pounds a year, and I de&s;ire you to tell him &s;o."</Q> It is &s;trange, however, to think, that John&s;on was not free from
<PB N="572" REF="574">
 that general weakne&s;s of being aver&s;e to execute a will, &s;o that he delayed it from time to time; and had it not been for Sir John Hawkins's repeatedly urging it, I think it is probable that his kind re&s;olution would not have been fulfilled. After making one which, as Sir John Hawkins informs us, extended no further than the promi&s;ed annuity, John&s;on's final di&s;po&s;ition of his property was e&s;tabli&s;hed by a Will and Codicil, of which copies are &s;ubjoined <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<P>Upon the&s;e te&s;tamentary deeds it is proper to make a few ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>His expre&s;s declaration with his dying breath of his faith as a Chri&s;tian, as it had been often practi&s;ed in &s;uch &s;olemn writings, was of real con&s;equence from this great man, as the conviction of a mind equally acute and &s;trong might well overbalance the doubts of others who were his con|temporaries. The expre&s;&s;ion <HI>polluted</HI> may to &s;ome convey an impre&s;&s;ion of more than ordinary contamination; but that is not warranted by its genuine meaning, as appears from <Q REND="inline">"The Rambler,"</Q> No. 42. The &s;ame word is u&s;ed in the will of Dr. Sander&s;on, Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, who was piety it&s;elf.</P>
<P>His legacy of two hundred pounds to the repre&s;entatives of Mr. Innys, book&s;eller in St. Paul's Church-yard, was the effect of a very worthy motive. He told Sir John Hawkins, that his father having become bankrupt, Mr. Innys had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with money or credit to continue his bu&s;ine&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"This (&s;aid he) I con&s;ider as an obligation on me to be grateful to his de&s;cendants."</Q></P>
<P>The amount of his property proved to be con&s;iderably more than he had &s;uppo&s;ed it to be. Sir John Hawkins e&s;timates the beque&s;t to Francis Barber at a &s;um little &s;hort of fifteen hundred pounds, including an annuity of &s;eventy pounds to be paid to him by Mr. Langton, in con&s;idera|tion of &s;even hundred and fifty pounds, which John&s;on had lent to that gentleman. Sir John &s;eems not a little angry at this beque&s;t, and mutters <Q REND="inline">"a caveat again&s;t o&s;tentatious bounty and favour to negroes."</Q> But &s;urely when a man has money entirely of his own acqui&s;ition, e&s;pecially when he has no near relations, he may, without blame, di&s;po&s;e of it as he plea&s;es, and with great propriety to a faithful &s;ervant. Mr. Barber, by the recommendation of his ma&s;ter, retired to Lichfield, where he might pa&s;s the re&s;t of his days in comfort.</P>
<P>It has been objected that John&s;on has omitted many of his be&s;t friends when leaving books to &s;everal as tokens of his la&s;t remembrance. The names of Dr. Adams, Dr. Taylor, Dr. Burney, Mr. Hector, Mr. Murphy, the Authour of this Work, and others who were intimate with him, are not to be found in his Will. This may be accounted for by con&s;idering, that as he was very near his di&s;&s;olution at the time, he probably mentioned &s;uch as happened to occur to him; and that he may have recollected, that he had formerly &s;hewn others &s;uch proofs of his regard, that it was not nece&s;&s;ary to crowd his Will with their names. Mrs. Lucy Porter was much di&s;plea&s;ed that nothing was left to her; but be&s;ides what I have now &s;tated, &s;he &s;hould have con|&s;idered, that &s;he had left nothing to John&s;on by her Will, which was made during his life-time, as appeared at her decea&s;e.</P>
<P>His enumerating &s;everal per&s;ons in one group, and leaving them <Q REND="inline">"each a book at their election,"</Q> might po&s;&s;ibly have given occa&s;ion to a curious que&s;tion as to the order of choice, had they not luckily fixed on different books. His library, though by no means hand&s;ome in its appearance, was &s;old by Mr. Chri&s;tie for two hundred and forty-&s;even pounds, nine &s;hillings, many people being de&s;irous to have a book which had belonged to Dr. John&s;on. In many of them he had written little notes, &s;ometimes tender memorials of his departed wife; as, <Q REND="inline">"This was dear Tetty's book:"</Q> &s;ometimes occa&s;ional remarks of different &s;orts. Mr. Ly&s;ons, of Clifford's Inn, has favoured me with the two following:</P>

The con&s;ideration of the numerous papers of which he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,  &s;eems to have to have &s;truck John&s;on's mind with a &s;udden anxiety, and
<PB N="574" REF="576" MS="y">

them; in&s;tead of which, he, in a precipitate manner, burnt ma&s;&s;es of them,  as I &s;hould apprehend, with little regard to di&s;crimination. Not that I &s;uppo&s;e we have thus been deprived of any compo&s;itions which he had ever intended for the publick eye; but, from what e&s;caped the flames, I judge that many curious circum&s;tances relating both to him&s;elf and other literary characters have peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>Two very valuable articles, I am &s;ure, we have lo&s;t, which were two quarto volumes, containing a full, fair, and mo&s;t particular account of his own life, from his earlie&s;t recollection. I owned to him, that having accidentally &s;een them, I had read a great deal in them; and apologi&s;ing for the liberty I had taken, a&s;ked him if I could help it. He placidly an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I do not think you could have helped it."</Q> I &s;aid that I had for once in my life felt half an inclination to commit theft. It had come into my mind to carry off tho&s;e two volumes, and never &s;ee him more. Upon my inquiring how this would have affected him, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">) I believe I &s;hould have gone mad <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">One of tho&s;e volumes, Sir John Hawkins informs us he put into his pocket; for which the excu&s;e he &s;tates is, that he meant to pre&s;erve it from falling into the hands of a per&s;on whom he de&s;cribes &s;o as to make it &s;ufficiently clear who is meant; <Q REND="inline">"having &s;trong rea&s;ons (&s;ays he) to &s;u&s;pect that this man might find and make an ill u&s;e of the book."</Q> Why Sir John &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that the gentleman alluded to would act in this manner, he has not thought fit to explain. But what he did was not approved of by John&s;on; who, upon being acquainted of it without delay by a friend, expre&s;&s;ed great indignation, and warmly in&s;i&s;ted on the book being delivered up; and, in the &s;uppo&s;ition of his afterwards mi&s;&s;ing it, without knowing by whom it had been taken, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I &s;hould have gone out of the world di&s;tru&s;ting half mankind."</Q> Sir John next day wrote a letter to John&s;on, a&s;&s;igning the rea&s;ons for his conduct; upon which John&s;on ob&s;erved to Mr. Langton, <Q REND="inline">"Bi&s;hop Sander&s;on could not have dictated a better letter. I could almo&s;t &s;ay, <HI>Melius e&s;t &s;ic penitui&s;&s;e quam non crra&s;&s;e.</HI>"</Q> The agitation into which John&s;on was thrown by this incident, probably made him ha&s;tily burn tho&s;e precious records which mu&s;t ever be regretted.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>During his la&s;t illne&s;s, John&s;on experienced the &s;teady and kind attachment of his numerous friends. Mr. Hoole has drawn up a narrative of what pa&s;&s;ed in the vi&s;its which he paid to him during that time, from the 10th of November to the 13th of December, the day of his death inclu&s;ive, and has favoured me with a peru&s;al of it. Nobody was more attentive to him than
<PB N="576" REF="578" MS="y">
 Mr. Langton, to whom he tenderly &s;aid, <HI>To teneam moriens deficiente manu.</HI> And I think it highly to the honour of Mr. Windham, that his important occupations as an active &s;tate&s;man did not prevent him from paying a&s;&s;iduous re&s;pect to the dying Sage, whom he revered. Mr. Langton informs me, that <Q REND="inline">"one day he found Mr. Burke and four or five more friends &s;itting with John&s;on. Mr. Burke &s;aid to him, 'I am afraid, Sir, &s;uch a number of us may be oppre&s;&s;ive to you.'&mdash;'No, Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) it is not &s;o; and I mu&s;t be in a wretched &s;tate indeed, when your company would not be a delight to me.' Mr. Burke, in a tremulous voice, expre&s;&s;ive of being very tenderly affected, replied, 'My dear Sir, you have always been too good to me.' Immediately afterwards he went away. This was the la&s;t circum&s;tance in the acquaintance of the&s;e two eminent men."</Q></P>
<P>It is to the mutual credit of John&s;on and divines of different communions, that although he was a &s;teady Church-of-England man, there was neverthele&s;s much agreeable intercour&s;e between him and them. Let me particularly name the late Mr. La Trobe, and Mr. Hutton of the Moravian profe&s;&s;ion. His intimacy with the Engli&s;h Benedictines at Paris has been mentioned; and as an additional proof of the charity in which he lived with good men of the Romi&s;h Church, I am happy in this opportunity of recording his friend&s;hip with the Reverend Thomas Hu&s;&s;ey, D. D. His Catholick Maje&s;ty's Chaplain of Emba&s;&s;y at the Court of London, that very re&s;pectable man, eminent not only for his powerful eloquence as a preacher, but for his various abilities and acqui&s;itions.&mdash;Nay though John&s;on loved a Pre&s;byterian the lea&s;t, this did not prevent his having a long and uninterrupted &s;ocial connection with the Reverend Dr. James Fordyce, who, &s;ince his death hath gratefully celebrated him in a warm &s;train of devotional compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the melancholy clouds which hung over the dying John&s;on, his characteri&s;tical manner &s;hewed it&s;elf on different occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>When Dr. Warren, in the u&s;ual &s;tyle, hoped that he was better; his an&s;wer was, <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir. You cannot conceive with what acceleration I advance towards death."</Q></P>
<P>A man whom he had never &s;een before was employed one night to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">t up with him. Being a&s;ked next morning how he liked his attendant, his an&s;wer was, <Q REND="inline">"Not at all, Sir. The fellow's an ideot; he is as aukward as a turn-&s;pit when fir&s;t put into the wheel, and as &s;leepy as a dormou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Windham having placed a pillow conveniently to &s;upport him, he thanked him for his kindne&s;s, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"That will do&mdash;all that a pillow can do."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="577" REF="579" MS="y">
He repeated with great &s;pirit a poem, con&s;i&s;ting of about fifteen &s;tanzas  in four lines, in alternate rhymes, which he &s;aid he had compo&s;ed &s;ome years before, on occa&s;ion of a young gentleman's coming of age; &s;aying he had never repeated it but once &s;ince he compo&s;ed it, and had given but one copy of it. From the &s;pecimen of it which Mrs. Piozzi has given of it in her <Q REND="inline">"Anecdotes,"</Q> p. 196, it is much to be wi&s;hed that we could &s;ee the whole.</P>
<P>As he opened a note which his &s;ervant brought to him, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"An odd thought &s;trikes me.&mdash;We &s;hall receive no letters in the grave."</Q></P>
<P>He reque&s;ted three things of Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds:&mdash;To forgive him thirty pounds which he had borrowed of him&mdash;to read the Bible&mdash;and never to u&s;e his pencil on a Sunday. Sir Jo&s;hua readily acquie&s;ced.</P>
<P>Indeed he &s;hewed the greate&s;t anxiety for the religious improvement of his friends, to whom he di&s;cour&s;ed of its infinite con&s;equence. He begged of Mr. Hoole to think of what he had &s;aid, and to commit it to writing; and upon being afterwards a&s;&s;ured that this was done, pre&s;&s;ed his hands, and in an earne&s;t tone, thanked him. Dr. Brockle&s;by having attended him with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;iduity and kindne&s;s as his phy&s;ician and friend, he was peculiarly de&s;irous that this gentleman &s;hould not entertain any loo&s;e &s;peculative notions, but be confirmed in the truths of Chri&s;tianity, and in&s;i&s;ted on his writing down in his pre&s;ence, as nearly as he could collect it, the import of what pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;ubject; and Dr. Brockle&s;by having complied with the reque&s;t, he made him &s;ign the paper, and urged him to keep it in his own cu&s;tody as long as he lived.</P>
<P>John&s;on, with that native fortitude which amid&s;t all his bodily di&s;tre&s;s and mental &s;ufferings never for&s;ook him, a&s;ked Dr. Brockle&s;by, as a man in whom he had confidence, to tell him plainly whether he could recover. <Q REND="inline">"Give me (&s;aid he) a direct an&s;wer."</Q> The Doctor having fir&s;t a&s;ked him if he could bear the whole truth, which way &s;oever it might lead, and being an&s;wered that he could, declared that in his opinion he could not recover without a miracle. <Q REND="inline">"Then (&s;aid John&s;on) I will take no more phy&s;ick, not even my opiates; for I have prayed that I may render up my &s;oul to GOD unclouded."</Q> In this re&s;olution he per&s;evered, and at the &s;ame time u&s;ed only the weake&s;t kinds of &s;u&s;tenance.</P>
<P>The Reverend Mr. Strahan, who was the &s;on of his friend, and had been always one of his great favourites, had, during John&s;on's la&s;t illne&s;s, the &s;atisfaction of contributing to &s;oothe and comfort him. That gentle|man's hou&s;e at I&s;lington, of which he is Vicar, afforded occa&s;ionally and
<PB N="578" REF="580">
 ea&s;ily an agreeable change of place and fre&s;h air; and he attended al&s;o upon John&s;on in town in the di&s;charge of the &s;acred offices of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Strahan has given me the agreeable a&s;&s;urance, that after being in much agitation, John&s;on became quite compo&s;ed, and continued &s;o till his death.</P>
<P>Dr. Brockle&s;by, who will not be &s;u&s;pected of fanatici&s;m, obliged me with the following accounts:</P>
<Q><P>For &s;ome time before his death all his fears were calmed and ab&s;orbed by the prevalence of his faith, and his tru&s;t in the merits and <HI>propitiation</HI> of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>He talked often to me about the nece&s;&s;ity of faith in the <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> of JESUS, as nece&s;&s;ary beyond all good works whatever for the &s;alvation of mankind.</P>
<P>He pre&s;&s;ed me to &s;tudy Dr. Clarke, and to read his Sermons. I a&s;ked him why he pre&s;&s;ed Dr. Clark, an Arian <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">The change of his &s;entiments with regard to Dr. Clarke, is thus mentioned to me in a letter from the late Dr. Adams, Ma&s;ter of Pembroke College, Oxford.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The Doctor's prejudices were the &s;tronge&s;t, and certainly in another &s;en&s;e the weake&s;t, that ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;en&s;ible man. You know his extreme zeal for orthodoxy. But did you ever hear what he told me him&s;elf? That he had made it a rule not to admit Dr. Clarke's name in his Dictionary. This, however, wore off. At &s;ome di&s;tance of time he advi&s;ed with me what books he &s;hould read in defence of the Chri&s;tian Religion. I recommended 'Clarke's Evidences of Natural and Revealed Religion,' as the be&s;t of the kind; and I find in what is called his 'Prayers and Meditations,' that he was frequently employed in the latter part of his time in reading Clarke's Sermons.</Q></NOTE>. 'Becau&s;e (&s;aid he) he is fulle&s;t on the <HI>propitiatory &s;acrifice.</HI></P></Q>
<P>John&s;on having thus in his mind the true Chri&s;tian &s;cheme, at once rational and con&s;olatory, uniting ju&s;tice and mercy in the Divinity, with the improve|ment of human nature, while the Holy Sacrament was celebrating in his apart|ment, fervently uttered this prayer <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">The Reverend Mr. Strahan took care to have it pre&s;erved, and has in&s;erted it in <Q REND="inline">"Prayers and Meditations,"</Q> p. 222.</NOTE>:</P>

<P>From my brother Thomas David I have the&s;e particulars:</P>
<Q><P>The Doctor, from the time that he was certain his death was near, appeared to be perfectly re&s;igned, was &s;eldom or never fretful or out of temper, and often &s;aid to his faithful &s;ervant, who gave me this account, <Q REND="inline">'Attend, Francis, to the &s;alvation of your &s;oul, which is the object of greate&s;t importance:'</Q> he al&s;o explained to him pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;cripture, and &s;eemed to have plea&s;ure in talking upon religious &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>On Monday the 13th of December, the day on which he died, a Mi&s;s Morris, daughter to a particular friend of his, called, and &s;aid to Francis, that &s;he begged to be permitted to &s;ee the Doctor, that &s;he might earne&s;tly reque&s;t him to give her his ble&s;&s;ing. Francis went into the room, followed by the young lady, and delivered the me&s;&s;age. The Doctor turned him&s;elf in the bed, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'GOD ble&s;s you, my dear!'</Q> The&s;e were the la&s;t words he &s;poke.&mdash;His difficulty of breathing increa&s;ed till about &s;even o'clock in the evening, when Mr. Barber and Mrs. De&s;moulins, who were &s;itting in the room, ob&s;erving that the noi&s;e he made in breathing had cea&s;ed, went to the bed, and found he was dead.</P></Q>
<P>About two days after his death, the following very agreeable account was communicated to Mr. Malone, in a letter by the Honourable John Byng, to whom I am much obliged for granting me permi&s;&s;ion to introduce it in my work.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I &s;aw you, I have had a long conver&s;ation with Caw&s;ton <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Servant to the Right Honourable William Windham.</NOTE>, who &s;at up with Dr. John&s;on from nine o'clock on Sunday evening till ten o'clock on Monday morning. And from what I can gather from him, it &s;hould &s;eem, that Dr. John&s;on was perfectly compo&s;ed, &s;teady in hope, and re&s;igned to death. At the interval of each hour, they a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to &s;it up in his bed, and move his legs, which were in much pain; when he regularly addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;ervent prayer; and though &s;ometimes his voice failed him, his &s;en&s;es never did during that time. The only &s;u&s;tenance he received
<PB N="580" REF="582" MS="y">
was cyder and water. He &s;aid his mind was prepared, and the time to his di&s;&s;olution &s;eemed long. At &s;ix in the morning he enquired the hour, and on being informed, &s;aid that all went on regularly, and he felt he had but a few hours to live.</P>
<P>At ten o'clock in the morning he parted from Caw&s;ton, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'You &s;hould not detain Mr. Windham's &s;ervant.&mdash;I thank you;&mdash;bear my remem|brance to your ma&s;ter.'</Q> Caw&s;ton &s;ays, that no man could appear more collected, more devout, or le&s;s terrified at the thoughts of the approaching minute.</P>
<P>This account, which is &s;o much more agreeable than, and &s;omewhat different from yours, has given us the &s;atisfaction of thinking that that great man died as he lived, full of re&s;ignation, &s;trengthened in faith, and joyful in hope.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>A few days before his death he had a&s;ked Sir John Hawkins, as one of his executors, where he &s;hould be buried; and on being an&s;wered <Q REND="inline">"Doubtle&s;s in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey,"</Q> &s;eemed to feel a &s;atisfaction very natural to a poet, and indeed, in my opinion, very natural to every man of any imagination, who has no family &s;epulchre in which he can be laid with his fathers&punc; Accordingly, upon Monday, December 20, his remains were depo&s;ited in that noble and renowned edifice; and over his grave was placed a large blue flag-&s;tone, with this in&s;cription:</P>

<P>His funeral was attended by a re&s;pectable number of his friends, particu|larly by many of the members of THE LITERARY CLUB, who were then in town; and was al&s;o honoured by the pre&s;ence of &s;everal of the Reverend Chapter of We&s;tmin&s;ter. His &s;chool-fellow, Dr. Taylor, performed the mournful office of reading the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t I &s;hall not be accu&s;ed of affectation when I declare, that I find my&s;elf unable to expre&s;s all that I felt upon the lo&s;s of &s;uch a <Q REND="inline">"Guide, Philo&s;opher, and Friend."</Q> I &s;hall therefore not &s;ay one word of my own, but adopt tho&s;e of an eminent friend, which he uttered with an abrupt excellence, &s;uperiour to all &s;tudied compo&s;ition:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He has made a cha&s;m,
<PB N="581" REF="583">
which not only nothing can fill up, but which nothing has a tendency to fill up.&mdash;John&s;on is dead.&mdash;Let us go to the next be&s;t.&mdash;There is nobody.&mdash;No man can be &s;aid to put you in mind of John&s;on."</Q></P>
<P>As John&s;on had abundant homage paid to him during his life <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot"><P>Be&s;ides the Dedications to him by Dr. Gold&s;mith, the Reverend Dr. Franklin, and the Reverend Mr. Wil&s;on, which I have mentioned according to their dates, there was one by a lady&punc; of a ver&s;ification of <Q REND="inline">"Aningait and Ajut,"</Q> and one by the ingenious Mr. Walker, of his <Q REND="inline">"Rhetorical Grammar."</Q> I have introduced into this work &s;everal compliments paid to him in the writings of his contemporaries; but the number of them is &s;o great, that we may fairly &s;ay that there was almo&s;t a general tribute.</P>
<P>Let me not be forgetful of the honour done to him by Colonel Myddelton, of Gwaynynog, near Denbigh; who, on the banks of a rivulet in his Park, where John&s;on delighted to &s;tand and repeat ver&s;es, erected an urn with the following in&s;cription:</P><Q>This &s;pot was often dignified by the pre&s;ence of<LB>SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL. D.<LB>Who&s;e moral writings, exactly conformable to the precepts of Chri&s;tianity,<LB>Give ardour to Virtue and confidence to Truth.</Q>

<P>As no incon&s;iderable circum&s;tance of his &s;ame, we mu&s;t reckon the extraordinary zeal of the arti&s;ts to extend and perpetuate his image. I can enumerate a bu&s;t by Mr. Nollckens, and the many ca&s;ts which are made from it; &s;everal pictures by Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds; one by Mr. Zoffani; and one by Mr. Opie: and the following engravings of his portrait: 1. One by Cooke, from Sir Jo&s;hua, for the Proprietors' edition of his folio Dictionary.&mdash;2. One from ditto by ditto, for their quarto edition.&mdash;3. One from Opie, by Heath, for Harri&s;on's edition of his Dictionary.&mdash;4. One from Nollckens's bu&s;t of him, by Bartolozzi, for Fielding's quarto edition of his Dictionary.&mdash;5. One &s;mall from Harding, by Trotter, for his <Q REND="inline">"Beauties."</Q>&mdash;6. One &s;mall from Sir Jo&s;hua, by Trotter, for his <Q REND="inline">"Lives of the Poets."</Q>&mdash;7. One &s;mall one from Sir Jo&s;hua, by Hall, for <Q REND="inline">"The Rambler."</Q>&mdash;8. One &s;mall from an original drawing in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. John Simco, etched by Trotter, for another edition of his <Q REND="inline">"Lives of the Poets."</Q>&mdash;9. One &s;mall, no painter's name, etched by Taylor, for his John&s;oniana.&mdash;10. One folio whole length, with his oak &s;tick, as de&s;cribed in Bo&s;well's <Q REND="inline">"Tour,"</Q> drawn and etched by Trotter.&mdash;11. One large mezzotinto from Sir Jo&s;hua, by Doughty.&mdash;12. One large Roman head from Sir Jo&s;hua, by Marchi.&mdash;13. One octavo, holding a book to his eye, from Sir Jo&s;hua, by Hall, for his works.&mdash;14. One &s;mall from a drawing from the life, and engraved by Trotter, for his Life publi&s;hed by Kear&s;ley.&mdash;15. One large from Opie, by Mr. Townley, an ingenious engraver now at Berlin. This is one of the fine&s;t mezzotintos that ever was executed; and what renders it of extraordinary value, the plate was de&s;troyed after four or five impre&s;&s;ions only were taken of. One of them is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir William Scott.&mdash;16. One large from Sir Jo&s;hua's fir&s;t picture of him, by Heath&punc; for this work.&mdash;17. And one for Lavater's E&s;&s;ay on Phy&s;iognomy, in which John&s;on's counte|nance is analy&s;ed upon the principles of that fanciful writer.</P></NOTE>, &s;o no writer in this nation ever had &s;uch an accumulation of literary honours after his death. A &s;ermon upon that event was preached in St. Mary's church, Oxford, before the Univer&s;ity, by the Reverend Mr. Agutter, of Magdalen College. The Lives, the Memoirs, the E&s;&s;ays, both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e,
<PB N="582" REF="584" MS="y">
which have been publi&s;hed concerning him, would make many volumes. The numerous attacks too upon him, I con&s;ider as making part of his con&s;e|quence, upon the principle which he him&s;elf &s;o well knew and a&s;&s;erted. Many who trembled at his pre&s;ence were forward in a&s;&s;ault when they no longer apprehended danger. When one of his little pragmatical foes was invidiou&s;ly &s;narling at his fame, the Reverend Dr. Parr exclaimed, with his u&s;ual bold animation, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, now that the old lion is dead, every ass thinks he may kick at him."</Q></P>
<P>A monument for him in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey was re&s;olved upon &s;oon after his death, and has been &s;upported by a mo&s;t re&s;pectable contribution; and in the cathedral of his native city of Lichfield a &s;maller one is to be erected. To compo&s;e his epitaph has excited the warme&s;t competition of genius. If <HI>laudari &agrave; laudato viro</HI> be prai&s;e which is highly e&s;timable, I &s;hould not forgive my&s;elf were I to omit the following &s;epulchral ver&s;es on the authour of THE ENGLISH DICTIONARY, written by the Right Honourable Henry Flood:</P>

<P>The character of SAMUEL JOHNSON has, I tru&s;t, been &s;o developed in the cour&s;e of this work, that they who have honoured it with a peru&s;al, may be con&s;idered as well acquainted with him. As, however, it may be expected that I &s;hould collect into one view the capital and di&s;tingui&s;hing features of this extraordinary man, I &s;hall endeavour to acquit my&s;elf of that part of my biographical undertaking <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">As I certainly do not &s;ee any rea&s;on to give a different character of my illu&s;trious friend now&punc; from what I formerly gave, the greate&s;t part of the &s;ketch of him in my <Q REND="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</Q> is here adopted.</NOTE>, however difficult it may be to do that which many of my readers will do better for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>His figure was large and well formed, and his countenance of the ca&s;t of an ancient &s;tatue; yet his appearance was rendered &s;trange and &s;omewhat uncouth, by convul&s;ive cramps, by the &s;cars of that di&s;temper which it was once imagined the royal touch could cure, and by a &s;lovenly mode of dre&s;s. He had the u&s;e only of one eye; yet &s;o much does mind govern and even &s;upply the deficiency of organs, that his vi&s;ual perceptions, as far as they
<PB N="583" REF="585" MS="y">
extended, were uncommonly quick and accurate. So morbid was his tem|perament, that he never knew the natural joy of a free and vigorous u&s;e of his limbs: when he walked, it was like the &s;truggling gait of one in fetters; when he rode, he had no command or direction of his hor&s;e, but was carried as if in a balloon. That with his con&s;titution and habits of life he &s;hould have lived &s;eventy-five years, is a proof that an inherent <HI>vivida vis</HI> is a powerful pre&s;ervative of the human frame.</P>
<P>Man is in general made up of contradictory qualities, and the&s;e will ever &s;hew them&s;elves in &s;trange &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, where a con&s;i&s;tency in appearance at lea&s;t, if not in reality, has not been attained by long habits of philo&s;ophical di&s;cipline. In proportion to the native vigour of the mind, the contradictory qualities will be the more prominent, and more difficult to be adju&s;ted; and therefore we are not to wonder, that John&s;on exhibited an eminent example of this remark which I have made upon human nature. At different times he &s;eemed a different man, in &s;ome re&s;pects; not, however, in any great or e&s;&s;ential article, upon which he had fully employed his mind and &s;ettled certain principles of duty, but only in his manners, and in di&s;plays of argument and fancy in his talk. He was prone to &s;uper&s;tition, but not to credulity. Though his imagination might incline him to a belief of the marvellous and the my&s;terious, his vigorous rea&s;on examined the evidence with jealou&s;y. He was a &s;incere and zealous Chri&s;tian, of high Church-of-England and monar|chical principles, which he would not tamely &s;uffer to be que&s;tioned; and had perhaps, at an early period, narrowed his mind &s;omewhat too much, both as to religion and politicks. His being impre&s;&s;ed with the danger of extreme latitude in either, though he was of a very independent &s;pirit, occa&s;ioned his appearing &s;omewhat unfavourable to the prevalence of that noble freedom of &s;entiment which is the be&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of man. Nor can it be denied, that he had many prejudices; which, however, frequently &s;ugge&s;ted many of his pointed &s;ayings, that rather &s;hew a playfulne&s;s of fancy than any &s;ettled malignity. He was &s;teady and inflexible in maintaining the obligations of religion and morality, both from a regard for the order of &s;ociety, and from a veneration for the Great Source of all order; correct, nay &s;tern in his ta&s;te; hard to plea&s;e, and ea&s;ily offended; impetuous and irritable in his temper, but of a mo&s;t humane and benevolent heart <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">In the <HI>Olla Podrida,</HI> a collection of E&s;&s;ays publi&s;hed at Oxford, there is an excellent paper upon the character of John&s;on, &s;aid to be written by the Reverend Dr. Horne, now Bi&s;hop of Norwich. The following pa&s;&s;age is eminently happy:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"To reject wi&s;dom, becau&s;e the per&s;on of him who communicates it is uncouth, and his manners are inelegant;&mdash;what is it, but to throw away a pine-apple, and a&s;&s;ign for a rea&s;on the roughne&s;s of its coat?"</Q></NOTE>, which &s;hewed it&s;elf not only
<PB N="584" REF="586" MS="y">
in a mo&s;t liberal charity, as far as his circum&s;tances would allow, but in a thou&s;and in&s;tances of active benevolence. He was afflicted with a bodily di&s;ea&s;e which made him re&s;tle&s;s and fretful, and with a con&s;titutional melan|choly, the clouds of which darkened the brightne&s;s of his fancy, and gave a gloomy ca&s;t to his whole cour&s;e of thinking: we therefore ought not to wonder at his &s;allies of impatience and pa&s;&s;ion at any time, e&s;pecially when provoked by obtru&s;ive ignorance or pre&s;uming petulance; and allowance mu&s;t be made for his uttering ha&s;ty and &s;atirical &s;allies, even again&s;t his be&s;t friends. And &s;urely, when it is con&s;idered that <Q REND="inline">"amid&s;t &s;ickne&s;s and &s;orrow"</Q> he exerted his faculties in &s;o many works for the benefit of mankind, and particularly that he achieved the great and admirable Dictionary of our language, we mu&s;t be a&s;toni&s;hed at his re&s;olution. The &s;olemn text of <Q REND="inline">"him to whom much is given, much will be required,"</Q> &s;eems to have been ever pre&s;ent to his mind in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">igorous &s;en&s;e, and to have made him di&s;&s;atisfied with his labours and acts of goodne&s;s, however comparatively great; &s;o that the unavoidable con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his &s;uperiority was in that re&s;pect a cau&s;e of di&s;|quiet. He &s;uffered &s;o much from this, and from the gloom which perpetually haunted him, and made &s;olitude frightful, that it may be &s;aid of him, <Q REND="inline">"If in this life only he had hope, he was of all men mo&s;t mi&s;erable."</Q> He loved prai&s;e when it was brought to him; but was too proud to &s;eek for it. He was &s;omewhat &s;u&s;ceptible of flattery. As he was general and unconfined in his &s;tudies, he cannot be con&s;idered as ma&s;ter of any one particular &s;cience; but he had accumulated a va&s;t and various collection of learning and knowledge, which was &s;o arranged in his mind, as to be ever in readine&s;s to be brought forth. But his &s;uperiority over other learned men con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in what may be called the art of thinking, the art of u&s;ing his mind; a certain continual power of &s;eizing the u&s;eful &s;ub&s;tance of all that he knew, and exhibiting it in a clear and &s;orcible manner; &s;o that knowledge which we often &s;ee to be no better than lumber in men of dull under&s;tanding, was in him true, evident, and actual wi&s;dom. His moral precepts are practical; for they are drawn from an intimate acquaintance with human nature. His maxims carry conviction; for they are founded on the ba&s;is of common &s;en&s;e. His mind was &s;o full of imagery, that he might have been perpetually a poet; yet it is remarkable, that however rich his pro&s;e is in that re&s;pect, the poetical pieces which he wrote were in general not &s;o, but rather &s;trong &s;entiment and acute ob&s;ervation, conveyed in good ver&s;e, particularly in heroick couplets. Though u&s;ually grave and even aweful in his deportment, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed uncommon and peculiar powers of wit and humour; he frequently
<PB N="587" REF="587">
indulged him&s;elf in colloquial plea&s;antry; and the heartie&s;t merriment was often enjoyed in his company; with this great advantage, that as it was entirely free from any poi&s;onous tincture of vice or impiety, it was &s;alutary to tho&s;e who &s;hared in it. He had accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to &s;uch accuracy in his common conver&s;ation <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Though a perfect re&s;emblance of John&s;on is not to be found in any age, parts of his cha|racter are admirably expre&s;&s;ed by Clarendon, in drawing that of Lord Falkland, whom the noble and ma&s;terly hi&s;torian de&s;cribes at his &s;eat near Oxford:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Such an immen&s;ene&s;s of wit, &s;uch a &s;olidity of judgement, &s;o infinite a fancy, bound in by a mo&s;t logical ratiocination.&mdash;His acquaintance was cultivated by the mo&s;t polite and accurate men, &s;o that his hou&s;e was a Univer|&s;ity in le&s;s volume, whither they came not &s;o much for repo&s;e as &s;tudy, and to examine and refine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ho&s;e gro&s;&s;er propo&s;itions, which lazine&s;s and con&s;ent made current in conver&s;ation."</Q></P>
<P>Bayle's account of <HI>Menage</HI> may al&s;o be quoted as exceedingly applicable to the great &s;ubject of this work.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"His illu&s;trious friends erected a very glorious monument to him in the collection entitled <HI>Menagiana.</HI> Tho&s;e, who judge of things aright, will confe&s;s that this collection is very proper to &s;hew the extent of genius and learning which was the character of Menage. And I may be bold to &s;ay, that <HI>the excellent works he publi&s;hed will not di&s;tingui&s;h him from other learned men &s;o advantageou&s;ly as this.</HI> To publi&s;h books of great learning, to make Greek and Latin ver&s;es exceedingly well turned, is not a common talent, I own; neither is it extremely rare. It is incomparably more difficult to find men who can furni&s;h di&s;cour&s;e about an infinite number of things, and who can diver&s;ify them an hundred ways. How many authours are there, who are admired for their works, on account of the va&s;t learning that is di&s;played in them, who are not able to &s;u&s;tain a conver&s;ation. Tho&s;e, who know Menage only by his books, might think he re&s;embled tho&s;e learned men: but if you &s;hew the MENAGIANA, you di&s;tingui&s;h him from them, and make him known by a talent which is given to very few learned men. There it appears that he was a man who &s;poke off hand a thou&s;and good things. His memory extended to what was ancient and modern; to the court and to the city; to the dead and to the living languages; to things &s;erious and things joco&s;e; in a word, to a thou&s;and &s;orts of &s;ubjects. That which appeared a trifle to &s;ome readers of the <HI>Menagiana,</HI> who did not con&s;ider circum&s;tances, cau&s;ed admiration in other readers, who minded the difference between what a man &s;peaks without preparation, and that which he prepares for the pre&s;s. And therefore we cannot &s;ufficiently commend the care which his illu&s;trious friends took to erect to him a monument &s;o capable of giving him immortal glory. They were not obliged to rectify what they had heard him &s;ay; for in &s;o doing they had not been faithful hi&s;torians of his conver&s;ations."</Q></P></NOTE>, that he at all times delivered him&s;elf with a force, and elegant choice of expre&s;&s;ion, the effect of which was aided by his having a loud voice, and a &s;low deliberate utterance. He united a mo&s;t logical head with a mo&s;t fertile imagination, which gave him an extraordinary advantage in arguing; for he could rea&s;on clo&s;e or wide, as he &s;aw be&s;t for the moment. Exulting in his intellectual &s;trength and dexterity, he could, when he plea&s;ed, be the greate&s;t &s;ophi&s;t that ever contended in the li&s;ts of declamation; and from a &s;pirit of contradiction, and a delight in &s;hewing his powers, he would often maintain the wrong &s;ide with equal warmth and
<PB N="588" REF="588" MS="y">
ingenuity: &s;o that, when there was an audience, his real opinions could &s;eldom be gathered from his talk; though when he was in company with a &s;ingle friend, he would di&s;cu&s;s a &s;ubject with genuine fairne&s;s. But he was too con|&s;cientious to make errour permanent and pernicious, by deliberately writing it; and in all his numerous works he earne&s;tly inculcated what appeared to him to be the truth. His piety was con&s;tant, and was the ruling principle of all his conduct; and the more we con&s;ider his character, we &s;hall be the more di&s;po&s;ed to regard him with admiration and reverence.</P>
