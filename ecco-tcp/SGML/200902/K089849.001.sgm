<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have not taken up the Pen to trouble you with an Addre&s;s in the u&s;ual Stile of Dedicators; to a warm and lively Imagination, &s;uch as Mr. NUGENT's, Novelty will appear an e&s;&s;ential Grace in
<PB REF="4">Compo&s;ition; and what Kind of Novelty can, at this Time of Day, be introduced in a Form of Writ|ing, which has been indi&s;crimi|nately hackneyed by the Witty, the Venal, and the Dull for &s;everal Centuries? I &s;hall therefore have no Recour&s;e to exhau&s;ted Topics, nor &s;hall I endeavour to cull from the Stores of common Place a Se|cond-hand Garland, which would not fail to be offen&s;ive to your De|licacy, however, your Politene&s;s might induce you to excu&s;e the Aukwardne&s;s of the Attempt. I &s;hall leave it, Sir, to the City of <HI>Bri|&s;tol,</HI> to &s;peak aloud of your eminent Abilities, and to the Annals of Par|liament, to di&s;play the brilliant
<PB REF="5">Share you have had in all public Debates, without adding the Ef|forts of my feeble Voice to echo back your Fame in Dedicatory Panegyric; though I per&s;uade my|&s;elf, were I to trouble you with it, one Degree of Novelty, might be allowed me, I mean Sincerity; which I take to be a Quality totally unknown to the Offerers of In|cen&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT it is not the able State&s;|man I am at pre&s;ent to addre&s;s; it is the Patronage of the Man of Genius, Wit and Humour my Am|bition has prompted me to &s;olicit, and, I believe, every one will agree with me that I could not any where
<PB REF="6">chu&s;e a Name more ju&s;tly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for tho&s;e &s;plendid Embel|li&s;hments, than that of Mr. NU|GENT.</P>
<P>I AM not in&s;en&s;ible, that, in doing this, I may fall under the Cen&s;ure of the witty Doctor <HI>Young</HI> when he &s;ays,
<Q><L>As Pedlars with &s;ome Hero's Head make bold,</L>
<L>Illu&s;trious Mark!&mdash;where Pins are to be &s;old.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Truth is, I am afraid, the fugitive Pieces contained in the&s;e little Volumes will hardly be found worthy of your Attention; but if
<PB REF="7">they are admitted to lie in any Corner of your Study, I &s;hall con|gratulate with my&s;elf that they have found &s;o honourable a Shelter, and I &s;hall be ever proud of having &s;eized this Opportunity of &s;ub|&s;cribing my&s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is ob&s;erved by Lord <HI>Shaft&s;bury</HI> that every Man, who publi&s;hes a Book, pro|fe&s;&s;es Wi&s;dom; but the Author of the following E&s;&s;ays begs Leave to make him&s;elf an Exception to this general Rule of the noble Writer. Having had &s;ome Rea&s;on to imagine that the Numbers of the GRAY's-INN JOURNAL, during its periodi|cal Publication, were not unacceptable to the Public, he determined not to leave them in their &s;cattered Condition, and has therefore been at &s;ome Pains to collect them together, in as neat a Manner as he could, and with as many Retrenchments, Additions and Corrections as his various Avocations would permit. He has only to add, that, with all due Re&s;ignation, he gives up Commas and Points, Errors of the Pre&s;s, and all tho&s;e Inaccuracies, which <HI>Horace</HI> tells us ari&s;e from Inadvertency, or the Imbecillity of human Nature, to
<PB REF="9">the &s;mall Critics, and anonymous Pam|phleteers, of whom he has given his Opi|nion in the E&s;&s;ay, No. 88. He hopes no rea&s;onable Exception can be made by the Sen&s;ible and the Candid to his Sentiments in general, or the occa&s;ional Frolicks of an a&s;&s;umed Character. It &s;hould be remem|bered, that Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s Remark in the <HI>Rambler</HI> is founded upon Truth and Ju&s;tice. "The &s;eeming Vanity," &s;ays that excellent Author, <Q>with which I have &s;ometimes &s;poken of my&s;elf, would perhaps require an Apology, were it not extenuated by the Example of tho&s;e, who have pub|li&s;hed E&s;&s;ays before me, and by the Pri|vilege, which every namele&s;s Author has been hitherto allowed. A Ma&s;k, &s;ays <HI>Ca|&s;tiglione,</HI> confers a right of acting and &s;peaking with le&s;s Re&s;traint, even when the Wearer happens to be known.</Q></P>

<P>_IT has been remarked by Writers, whom a De&s;ire of adding to the Entertainment of the Public has incited to portion out their Endeavours into periodical E&s;&s;ays, that the fir&s;t Addre&s;s, in the introduc|tory Explanation of their Plan, has occa&s;ioned more vehement Corro&s;ions of their Nails, and more frequent Rubbings of the Forehead, than any other &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Compo&s;ition; in like Manner as we find Men, who, upon their fir&s;t Admi&s;&s;ion into a Company of Strangers, betray &s;everal aukward Move|ments in their Deportment, ari&s;ing from the different Ideas of Ba&s;hfulne&s;s and Diffidence, which agitate their Minds until the initial Ceremonies are adju&s;ted. As I propo&s;e to hold a literary Intercour&s;e with the Pub|lic, and flatter my&s;elf with the Hopes of conver&s;ing with
<PB N="2" REF="13">many Hundreds of my Countrymen every <HI>Saturday,</HI> I cannot i&s;&s;ue out my fir&s;t Performance, without feeling an extraordinary Solicitude for the Event, and being di&s;concerted by tho&s;e Alarms and Perturbations of Spi|rit, which are apt to &s;eize People of Sen&s;ibility in their Tempers, when irre&s;i&s;tible Principles of Action have prevailed over their Mode&s;ty, and called them forth into a con&s;picuous Point of View. The fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion has always great Influence upon Mens Judgments, and the Mind will often ha&s;tily form A&s;&s;ociations of Ideas, which it cannot afterwards ea&s;ily &s;eparate. On this Account I have been a not a little anxious about my fir&s;t Appearance, and after much Contemplation and deep Study, I &s;hould have been entirely at a Lo&s;s how to &s;et off, had not the Example of our parliamentary Candi|dates pointed out a Mode of Eloquence, to which I think proper to adhere on the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, as the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive Rhetoric I can &s;ugge&s;t to my&s;elf.</P>

Having thus declared my Ambition for literary Fame, I do not expect that all tho&s;e rival Wits, who for &s;ome Time pa&s;t have been making their Court to the Pub|lic, &s;hould in&s;tantly decline the Poll; on the contrary, I am apprehen&s;ive, that, as it generally happens at E|lections, much Scurrility will be di&s;charged upon the pre&s;ent Writer; and I am no way doubtful but they will proceed to the Extremity of di&s;puting my Property in <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> and obliging me to make out my Quali|fication. Of this, however, I hope to give &s;ufficient Proof in the Sequel; and whatever Animo&s;ities may ari&s;e, I am re&s;olved to pur&s;ue my Cour&s;e, without going out of the Way, like the Countryman in the Fable, to cru&s;h the Gra&s;hoppers that may make a Noi&s;e around me. I &s;hall con&s;ole my&s;elf in that Ca&s;e with a Reflection that tho&s;e Nui&s;ances are ever found in the Sun&s;hine.</P>
<Q>Sole &s;ub ardenti re&s;onant arbu&s;ta cicadis.
<BIBL><HI>VIRGIL.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>In the Pro&s;ecution of this De&s;ign the Reader is not to expect any Scandal, any Detraction, or Ill-nature, <HI>Ranger</HI> being determined not to indulge him&s;elf in the <HI>mala mentis gaudia,</HI> as <HI>Virgil</HI> finely calls the Gratifica|tions of a malevolent Spirit. As this Paper is com|menced to promote u&s;eful Mirth and Good-humour, it &s;hall never deviate from tho&s;e Principles; to &s;ecure which in my own Temper, and to &s;ow their Seeds in others, I &s;hall here beg Leave to &s;ay a few Words to my Friends, the CRITICS.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in the very &s;en&s;ible Pre|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> to his Works, that both Writers and their Readers are generally unrea&s;onable in the mutual Expectations they have of each other, the former fancying the
<PB N="4" REF="15">World mu&s;t approve whatever they produce, and the latter imagining that Authors are obliged at any Rate to plea&s;e them. For my Part, I &s;hould be glad to com|pound Matters with all the Critics of the Age; if they will abate &s;omething of their u&s;ual Severity, my De|mands upon them for Fame and Reputation &s;hall not be very exorbitant; and &s;hould they withhold from me that &s;mall Tribute, I hope, at lea&s;t, they will allow me to make as much wa&s;te Paper as the re&s;t of our periodi|cal Writers and daily Hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>From the latter of the&s;e, viz. our common News|papers, I do not perceive what Kind of Advan|tage can redound to a rational Creature, who can nei|ther receive In&s;truction or Entertainment, by reading that Mr. <HI>Such a one,</HI> an eminent Chee&s;emonger, died at his Country Hou&s;e, when perhaps he is in perfect good Health in <HI>Thames-Street;</HI> and if 'Squire <HI>Rent Roll</HI> is arrived in Town with a grand Retinue, I apprehend it no way intere&s;ting to any Man breathing, except his Taylor, his Pimp, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As there is, however, a Prin|ciple of Curio&s;ity inherent in our Con&s;titutions, I &s;hall make it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to admini&s;ter to its Gratification by Articles of true Intelligence annexed to every E&s;&s;ay. In the Re&s;earch of the&s;e I &s;hall &s;pare no Pains, and I flatter my&s;elf they will have a &s;tronger Tendency to di|vert Spleen and Melancholy, than dull Letters from the <HI>Hague,</HI> and fictitious Advices from the <HI>Swede</HI> and <HI>Tuck.</HI> By the&s;e Means I &s;hall be able to variegate this Work, and render it a Paper of Entertainment, if not of In&s;truction, and upon all Occa&s;ions I &s;hall think it incumbent on me to have &s;ome Regard to what is com|monly called Stile. For, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ent Practice, it appears to me that &s;uch Words &s;hould al|ways be cho&s;en as are mo&s;t &s;trongly and elegantly ex|pre&s;&s;ive of the intended Idea; and they &s;hould, if I am not mi&s;taken, be combined in &s;uch an Arrangement,
<PB N="5" REF="16">as will not be offen&s;ive to Grammar, or unintelligi|ble upon Peru&s;al. To this if &s;ome little Knowledge of the World can be added, I conceive it will be an additional Embelli&s;hment, as from thence may be de|rived &s;ome ju&s;t Exhibitions of human Life, and &s;ome proper Animadver&s;ions on Men and Manners; in which Articles I may venture to affirm the Writers above|mentioned are very deficient, they informing us no one Way of the World, unle&s;s it be that &s;o often inculcated by them, Leading to <HI>Mr. Keith's Chapel, down Clarges-Street, and turn on the Left Hand.</HI></P>
<P>Henceforth then be it known unto all Men, whom it may concern, that we <HI>Charles Ranger,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> have under|taken, and by the&s;e Pre&s;ents do undertake, the Conduct of a Paper entitled THE GRAY's-INN JOURNAL, which Name it is thought proper to give it, on Account of the Author's Re&s;idence in <HI>Gray's-Inn.</HI> We intend that this our Paper &s;hall be a general Critique on the Times, and all fal&s;e Appearances in Men and Books; and as we have ob&s;erved, that, what Dr. <HI>Young</HI> calls laughing Satire has always been mo&s;t conducive to the End we propo&s;e, we are determined to exert &s;ome certain Pow|ers called Wit, Humour, and Raillery, and we hereby advi&s;e our dearly beloved Readers to get their ri&s;ible Faculties in order, re&s;erving to our&s;elves, <HI>more majorum,</HI> the Privilege of being dull by De&s;ign. And it is there|fore ordered by the&s;e Pre&s;ents, that on or before <HI>Satur|day</HI> next all Offences &s;hall cea&s;e, or they who &s;hall be &s;ound delinquent &s;hall be pro&s;ecuted according to the Laws of hone&s;t Satire, in &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent E&s;&s;ay, or be obliged to take their Trial upon Indictment in our <HI>Court of Cen&s;orial Enquiry,</HI> the Proceedings of which &s;hall be faithfully recorded in our <HI>True Intelligence.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TRUE INTELLIGENCE.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to conduct this Undertaking with the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Variety of Information, Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> will not depend entirely upon his own Rambles, but has open|ed a Regi&s;ter-Office, where all Articles of News will be given in by proper Emi&s;&s;aries, and entered in a re|gular Manner by a &s;edate Book-keeper, &s;o that there will be little more to do than to &s;elect from the&s;e Re|po&s;itories. As there will frequently occur &s;hort Hints of Animadver&s;ion, which will not admit an entire E&s;&s;ay, I &s;hall occa&s;ionally throw out &s;ome cur&s;ory Re|flections dated from this Place, and I have given &s;trict Orders to my &s;everal Agents to keep a vigilant Eye upon all Objects whatever. By the&s;e Means the Man of Mode&s;ty, &s;tealing down the Bye-walk of Life, &s;hall blu&s;h to find his Virtue called into Day-light, and the concealed Hypocrite &s;tand in the Pillory of Detection. <HI>Amanda</HI> &s;hall not coquet it with every Coxcomb &s;he meets, nor <HI>Lothario</HI> make it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to ruin all female Virtue. In &s;hort, as the Satyri&s;t expre&s;&s;es it, all the Actions of Men, their &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ions, their De&s;ires, their Fears, their Re&s;entments, their Gratifications, their Delights, and their Frolicks, &s;hall be the mi&s;cel|laneous Subject of my Lucubrations.</P>

<P>_HAVING recommended my&s;elf, in my la&s;t <HI>Saturday</HI>'s Paper, to the Patronage of the male Part of my Readers, I &s;hall dedicate the pre&s;ent E&s;&s;ay to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fair; and, as it is principally calculated with a View to their Service, at the &s;ame Time that it carries with it a collateral Intention of in&s;inuating my&s;elf into their Favour, I mu&s;t beg to be admitted this Morning to their Toilets, to call off their Eyes for a little Time from the dearly-beloved Mirrour, to di&s;card <HI>Betty</HI> from her Attendance, and, in &s;hort, to exclude, for one half Hour, the whole Train of <HI>Dancing-ma&s;ters, Manteau-Makers, Stay-Makers, French-Barbers, Venders of Wa&s;hes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I am aware that the Ladies will be alarmed at the Thought of being alone with <HI>Ranger,</HI> but the Rea&s;on of my de&s;iring this Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of &s;o many Favourites is, becau&s;e I profe&s;s the very &s;ame Art, to which that Cla&s;s of People have always a&s;pired, that of heighten|ing the Charms of Female Beauty; and as two of a Trade can never agree, I think it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to meet with no Interruption, in this important Point, from the Pertne&s;s of a Chambermaid, the Servility of Trade&s;men, and the Shrugs and bri&s;k Interjections of <HI>French</HI> Proficients, who will, no Doubt, be greatly a&s;to|ni&s;hed to hear, that their artificial Embelli&s;hments, though they may &s;erve, when they do not luxuariantly wanton into &s;anta&s;tic Extravagancies, to adorn the Fe|male Form, are yet in no Way e&s;&s;ential; as Beauty, without &s;uch Auxiliaries, may be rendered &s;till more attractive in the Eyes of all Men of Sen&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="20"><HI>Horace,</HI> whom it is unnece&s;&s;ary to introduce to the Acquaintance of the Ladies, as <HI>Creech</HI> and <HI>Francis</HI> have taken that agreeable Office upon them&s;elves, was a Man of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed Ta&s;te in all Circum&s;tances of Life; and he tells us, in the Words of my Motto, that he &s;hall always love his <HI>Lalage</HI> &s;weetly &s;miling, and &s;weetly talking; which two Accompli&s;hments would not have been touched upon by &s;o fine a Poet, if they did not carry with them &s;ome peculiar Charm; and I am inclined to think that in them con&s;i&s;ts the whole Train of Love's Artillery.</P>
<P>Expre&s;&s;ion has been mentioned by every elegant Writer on this Subject, as the fir&s;t Ingredient in the Compo&s;ition of Beauty; and certainly the more plea&s;ing the Expre&s;&s;ion is, the more Energy will be derived from thence upon every Charm. For this Rea&s;on, the plea|&s;ing Smile is the be&s;t Hand-maid to an elegant Set of Features; it give numberle&s;s Graces to every Delicacy, and diffu&s;es over the whole Countenance an Emanation of that Sweetne&s;s of Temper, which is the native Or|nament of the Fair. To this Sentiment the witty Dr. <HI>Young</HI> has &s;ub&s;cribed in his <HI>Univer&s;al Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<Q><L>What's female Beauty but an Air divine,</L>
<L>Thro' which the Mind's all-gentle Graces &s;hine?</L>
<L>They, like the Sun, irradiate all between;</L>
<L>The <HI>Body</HI> charms, becau&s;e the <HI>Soul</HI> is &s;een.</L></Q>
<P>This Doctrine has not been e&s;tabli&s;hed without the utmo&s;t Propriety; for &s;urely &s;en&s;ele&s;s, inanimate Matter, however Symmetry, Colour and other Adjuncts, may recommend it, cannot any Way gain upon our Af|fections. I have &s;een many a Picture where the Face was well turned, and the Features ju&s;tly di&s;po&s;ed, and yet all Men of Judgment have invariably concurred to pronounce the Piece extremely bad, becau&s;e there were no perceptible Traces of a thinking Power within.
<PB N="10" REF="21">And if this Property is required in the mere Imitation of the human Face, what &s;hall be &s;aid when it is defi|cient in the Original? when the Appearance of a Mind, which alone can di&s;tingui&s;h us from other &s;ublunary Exi&s;tences, and which alone can impart real Satisfaction, and excite the &s;ocial Feelings in an intelligent Being, &s;eems to be totally ab&s;ent? Mi&s;s <HI>Millefont</HI> is without the nice&s;t Proportion of Features, and without a glo&s;&s;y Bloom of Complexion, and yet I believe no one ever &s;aw her &s;itting in a Side-Box at a Play, or dancing at an A&s;&s;embly, without feeling Love and Joy in &s;prightly Tumult about his Heart. On the other Hand, <HI>For|mo&s;a</HI> has a Delicacy of Shape, and Regularity of Coun|tenance, and &s;till no one of Ta&s;te will he&s;itate to pro|nounce her unamiable; and I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that &s;he is never toa&s;ted but by tho&s;e, who&s;e Intel|lectuals are &s;o poorly &s;tocked with Ideas, that they never perceive the Vacuity in others.</P>
<P>The &s;ecret Quality, from which this Difference ari&s;es, has been called by the <HI>French,</HI> a <HI>Je-ne-&s;cay-quoi,</HI> and the Phra&s;e has been adopted in this Country; but it is &s;erving the Purpo&s;es of good Sen&s;e to explode &s;o un|meaning a Term. For my own Part (with all due Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to better Judgments) I declare my&s;elf of that Sect of Speculati&s;ts who really believe that Women have Souls, and I am apt to imagine that the Operation of this inward Agent has no &s;mall Influence upon the outward Frame. A Poet of Eminence has &s;ung, "the Pa&s;&s;ions in the Features are," and therefore I &s;hould think, that tho&s;e Ladies, who are ambitious to appear lovely in the Eyes of Men, &s;hould &s;ome|times &s;it to an intellectual Mirrour, in order to &s;ee their Affections reflected to them; by which Means they would be enabled to adju&s;t them, to harmonize them, to keep them in regular Order, and, if I may &s;o &s;ay, make them &s;it right. In my Opinion, they &s;hould be as a&s;&s;iduous to fa&s;hion them&s;elves in this Point, as to
<PB N="11" REF="22">apply the Patch, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h a di&s;order'd Lock, to recal a &s;traggling Hair, to &s;ettle the Tucker, or com|po&s;e the Mant, &s;ince taking Care of the Movements of the Mind, is al&s;o regulating the Features.</P>
<P>From this will naturally re&s;ult the next E&s;&s;ential to Beauty, the Manner of Talking agreeably, than which Accompli&s;hment nothing can &s;o much enliven the amia|ble Sex. We are plea&s;ed to &s;ee a beautiful Pair of Lips in Motion, when every Thing that comes from them admini&s;ters to the Plea&s;ures of Conver&s;ation; the Spirits of the Fair are awakened by the Exerci&s;e of their thinking Faculties, and the Eye beams with double Lu&s;tre; the Tongue confirms, what the Countenance had before indicated, that all within is &s;prightly, chear|ful, gay, &s;pirited, and &s;en&s;ible. The Scene is frequent|ly &s;hifted to our Imagination; we are delighted to ob&s;erve the Celerity, which di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf in the Operations of the Female Under&s;tanding, and the quick Succe&s;&s;ion of Ideas, which they call up, amu&s;es with plea&s;ing Variety, while the Beauties of the Mind and Face mutually exalt each other, and we &s;tand convinced of the <HI>Platonic</HI> Tenet, that <HI>good</HI> and <HI>beautiful</HI> are the &s;ame.</P>
<P>There are three Things highly pernicious to the En|dearments of Beauty, from which I mu&s;t ab&s;olutely interdict tho&s;e, who are willing to become my Pupils. The Enemies to Loveline&s;s, which I mean, are GAMING, SCANDAL, and POLITICS, &s;urer De&s;troyers of every Elegance and Bloom, than a Spotted Fever or the Small-Pox; as chronical Di&s;ea&s;es are more fatal to the Con&s;titution, than a tran&s;itory Fit of an acute Illne&s;s.</P>
<P>With Regard to the fir&s;t of the&s;e Corro&s;ives, I leave it to the fair Votaries of Fortune to con&s;ider how the winning Graces and the attractive Smile can irradiate the Countenance, when the Internal is di&s;turbed by
<PB N="12" REF="23">Anxiety and Solicitude, which &s;oon tran&s;pire into the Face, and prey upon all their Charms. Be&s;ides, when the Temper is di&s;concerted, Politene&s;s and Good-man|ners are in Danger of being neglected; and while every one is intent upon the After-game, which is the fa&s;hion|able Term for that Cla&s;h of Tongues, frequently heard in one loud Din, as &s;oon as the Deal at <HI>Whi&s;t</HI> is out, it is not probable that the Fair can conver&s;e in a Manner &s;uitable to the Softne&s;s and Elegance of their Sex.</P>
<P><HI>Scandal</HI> always carries with it a dreadful Efficacy to ruin a delicate Face, becau&s;e it generally &s;prings from Envy or Malice, which are both entirely again&s;t my Rules for acquiring and pre&s;erving Beauty, as they are inveterate Habits, the Traces of which are apt to wear them&s;elves into the Complexion, inducing Frowns, Wrinkles, Roughne&s;s, and a &s;ettled Appearance of Ill|nature, of all Things the mo&s;t unamiable.</P>
<P><HI>Politics</HI> is al&s;o of pernicious Influence, tending to inflame the Ladies with Party-Rage, to cau&s;e Heats in the Face, and to occa&s;ion tho&s;e Vibrations of the Fan, Bitings of the Lips, and Fidgets on the Chair, which greatly di&s;compo&s;e the whole Form. On this Account I would have my fair Readers ab&s;tain from Parliamen|tary Debates. And, tho' the intended <HI>Naturalization-Act</HI> has engro&s;&s;ed the Thoughts of the whole Nation, I think it enough for the Ladies to have &s;ecretly re&s;olved not to marry a <HI>Jew;</HI> and without engaging too deeply in the Controver&s;y, the &s;parkling Cro&s;&s;es, which they wear upon their lovely Bo&s;oms, will be a &s;ufficient In|dication of their Principles, and will at once reflect a Lu&s;tre upon the Whitene&s;s of their Skins, and the Delicacy of their Sentiments.</P>
<P>In what has been premi&s;ed, I would have it remem|bered, that I do not mean to recommend a &s;tudied Simper, or a re&s;tle&s;s Exertion of Chit-Chat, but I
<PB N="13" REF="24">would have both to be a natural Effu&s;ion, from the Sources of Good-nature and Good-&s;en&s;e, which, I am convinced, will be found a better beautifying Cream, than any Co&s;metic adverti&s;ed in our News-Papers; and therefore in&s;tead of lying-in for a new Face, or u&s;ing any other Artifice, my Precept to the Ladies, is, BE GOOD-HUMOURED FOR A COMPLEXION; and I now give Notice, that I &s;hall carefully ob&s;erve, in all public Places, what Ladies repair a decayed Vi&s;age, or add new Graces to a blooming one, by this Receipt, and that I &s;hall in&s;ert an exact Li&s;t of the &s;ame in the Articles of News, which I &s;hall &s;erve up weekly to regale my Cu&s;tomers.

<P>I am always plea&s;ed, in a particular Manner, to em|brace every Opportunity of a&s;&s;embling you together; and as the invariable Rule of my Conduct has ever been to infu&s;e a true Spirit of Critici&s;m into the Minds of my People, I the more joyfully open the Se&s;&s;ions at pre|&s;ent,

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Papers which I have hitherto publi&s;h|ed, were chiefly intended to open a Way for the better Execution of this Under|taking, as Pioneers are di&s;patched to clear the Country for the main Body of an Army; and in the &s;ame Light I beg that the pre&s;ent Lucubration may
<PB N="15" REF="26">be con&s;idered. I find, &s;ince the Commencement of the <HI>Gray's-Inn Journal,</HI> that I have been the Subject of much Conver&s;ation in this Metropolis: The Critics, it &s;eems, are bu&s;y in their Enquiries after the Author. Does any body know him? &mdash; Has he been long upon Town? &mdash; Has he any Thing in him? &mdash; What Sort of a Man is he? &mdash; The&s;e and many other Que&s;tions of the &s;ame Nature are the Topics at pre&s;ent; and tho' at fir&s;t &s;etting out I thought to evade an Account of my&s;elf, having had always a &s;trong Antipathy to any Thing that might border upon the ridiculous Character of an Egoti&s;t; yet &s;uch is the Prevalence of Cu&s;tom, that it is now become a Tribute due from every Adven|turer in this Way, and therefore I &s;hall wave the Re|&s;olutions I have taken, and will at pre&s;ent gratify the Reader's Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>I am of the &s;prightly Family of the <HI>Rangers,</HI> who have made a di&s;tingui&s;hed Figure, in this Country, ever &s;ince the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. and am a near Relation to my Name&s;ake in the Play, whom many of my Readers have often admired when per&s;onated by Mr. <HI>Garrick.</HI> Though I do not at pre&s;ent a&s;cend by Lad|ders of Ropes into hone&s;t Men's Hou&s;es, yet, under a few Re&s;trictions, I &s;till bear &s;ome &s;imilar Habits of his Humour. My Education was at <HI>Eton,</HI> where I imbibed my fir&s;t Tincture of Letters; though, to tell the Truth, I was chiefly remarkable, at that Place, for running out of Bounds. I &s;carcely pa&s;&s;ed over a Week without paying a Vi&s;it to <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> I was delighted in the Ca&s;tle with the bold Imagery which the Touch of <HI>Verrio</HI>'s Pencil has poured fourth to the Eye, and to &s;ee the Canvas every where glowing with mimic Life was plea&s;ing to my young Imagination.</P>
<P>At length, with the Character of a wild Lad that had <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> enough, I was removed to the Univer&s;ity, where I maintained the &s;ame Reputation for five Years. Whatever was the Rea&s;on of it, I never could adopt any Party-Principles, and tho&s;e whom I per|ceived
<PB N="16" REF="27">attached to Prejudices of either Side have always appeared to me in very ludicrous Colours. I have known a <HI>Jacobite</HI> drink him&s;elf out of his Health and Fortune for the Good of his Country, and I have &s;een a very worthy Gentleman reduced to Nece&s;&s;ity by &s;quandering his Sub&s;tance in Elections, to keep out the Pope, the Devil, and the <HI>French</HI> King. I believe there cannot be a more ridiculous Character than that of a <HI>State Quixote,</HI> who having Affairs of Moment to him&s;elf and his Family, generou&s;ly neglects his own Concerns to take Care of his Country, which would be in every Particular as well without &s;uch a Patriot.</P>
<P>For my part, I have no Manner of Ta&s;te for Poli|ticks; the Election of the King of the <HI>Romans</HI> does not concern me, nor do I trouble my&s;elf about the Window|light Tax, provided the Prices at the Play-Hou&s;e are not rai&s;ed upon us; and as to a &s;tanding Army, twen|ty thou&s;and Red-coats &s;hall give me no kind of Trou|ble, while they plant no Brui&s;ers in the Pit to over-rule our Deci&s;ions. Should any &s;uch Attempts be made upon the Birth-right Privileges of an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> I &s;hall then be as warm a Patriot as the be&s;t of them. Not even the Freedom of both Hou&s;es &s;hall buy me off; and I have now lying by me &s;everal E&s;&s;ays on Hi&s;tory, and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Form of Government, which in that Ca&s;e &s;hall &s;ee the Light.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Principles I have contracted with Re|gard to Matters of State; as to my Per&s;on, I beg Leave to be &s;ilent on that Head, as I do not chu&s;e to receive any Propo&s;als for Marriage, which I am told have been publickly &s;olicited by a certain daily Writer. Thus much I will hint, I am now in the two and thirtieth Year of my Age, and, after having taken the Tour of <HI>Europe, Gray</HI>'s <HI>Inn</HI> is become, in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Language, <HI>the Sea-mark of my utmo&s;t Sail.</HI> I have been regi&s;tered according to the Police in <HI>Paris,</HI> and, like Sir <HI>Harry Wildair</HI> in the Play, have play'd at Hot|cockles
<PB N="17" REF="28">with an whole Convent of Nuns in <HI>Italy:</HI> In &s;hort, I have gone through all the Variety of Manners and Diver&s;ions in each different Country, and now be|hold your Beau up to the Ears in Ink. I look upon the Gardens belonging to this Society to be the Seat of the Mu&s;es: Here the great <HI>Bacon</HI> pa&s;&s;ed his con|templative Hours; and here, at an humble Di&s;tance, the pre&s;ent Writer purpo&s;es to follow his Steps.</P>
<Q>&mdash;Longe &s;equere, &amp; ve&s;tigia &s;emper adora.
<BIBL><HI>STATIUS.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>The Day I do not take a Turn in the poetic Ground ju&s;t mention'd, I feel the mo&s;t aukward Sen&s;ations, and fancy to my&s;elf that I breathe with Difficulty. This I mu&s;t own is an Oddity in my Temper, but Habit has now confirmed it. However, I &s;hall make it &s;ub&s;er|vient to the De&s;ign of this Paper, as it will afford me an Opportunity of collecting Materials for the&s;e Lu|cubrations; and, among the Number that frequent this Place, I &s;hall be able &s;ometimes to glean a few Characters for the Amu&s;ement of my Readers. Be|&s;ides this, I belong to a Club of <HI>Originals,</HI> which meets, once in each Month, at the <HI>Devil-Tavern,</HI> near <HI>Tem|ple-Bar.</HI> Every Member of it is remarkable for &s;ome Peculiarity in his Manners and Way of thinking, and this not contracted by an affected Imitation of others, but ab&s;olutely inherent and native to the re&s;pective Per&s;ons. I &s;hall take a proper Opportunity to bring the Town acquainted with this Society, and perhaps may deduce from their A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;uch Matter, as will not be di&s;agreeable to my Reader.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t add to what has been &s;aid, that I have from Nature a very extraordinary Talent, which, as it will be of U&s;e hereafter, I will here explain. I have been remarkable from my Infancy for a mo&s;t &s;urprizing Skill in Phy&s;iognomy, and have had, from my greener Years, the &s;harpe&s;t Di&s;cernment into the Pa&s;&s;ions of Men from the Survey of their Countenances. This
<PB N="18" REF="29">Faculty has grown up with me, and it is now arrived to that Degree of Penetration, that I can, by infallible Rules, read the Thoughts of People. When a Critic talks of <HI>Longinus,</HI> I can often perceive, by the Ca&s;t of his Eye, that he never looked into him; and in all Deci&s;ions upon Stile, Language, and Authors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I can di&s;cover, with a Glance, the &s;ecret Springs of Action and the latent Prejudices lurking in their Minds. Of this more another Time. As to the News, I &s;hall receive frequent Contributions from a particular Friend, who is every Way qualified for that Branch. His Name is <HI>Harry Wildair,</HI> and I am confident he will conduce a good deal to enliven this Paper.</P>
<P>Having thus far explained my&s;elf, I will conclude with a few Re&s;olutions which I have taken for the better conducting this our <HI>Gray's Inn Journal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That this Author &s;hall not be the Tool of any Party whatever.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That he &s;hall not, like the gay <HI>In&s;pector,</HI> trifle with his Readers <HI>over his Tea,</HI> or <HI>wa&s;hing his Hands,</HI> but that he &s;hall exert his be&s;t Endeavours for their Entertainment.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That he &s;hall always have &s;ome vi&s;ible Subject, and &s;ome little Regard to the Order and Pro|priety of his Words.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That the Mottos to be prefixed to the E&s;|&s;ays &s;hall not be taken at random out of the <HI>Gradus ad Parna&s;&s;um,</HI> but that they be &s;elected from &s;ome good Author, without bad <HI>Latin,</HI> fal&s;e Quantity, and bearing &s;ome Reference to the Point in Hand.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That no indecent Liberties be taken with the Character of any Gentleman or Lady.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved la&s;tly,</HI> That he &s;hall not indulge him&s;elf in any impertinent Vanity about him&s;elf, his Intrigues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but that he &s;hall, to the be&s;t of his Power, make good Sen&s;e the Rule of his Writings, according to the Maxim in <HI>Horace.</HI></P>

<P>_THE Operations of the human Mind are at all Times extremely &s;ubtile, and while we compound, vary, and a&s;&s;oci|ate our Ideas into &s;o many different Combinations, the Workings of the Soul are not attended to, and the Traces they leave are &s;o delicate, that they are afterwards &s;carcely to be percei|ved. I do not think this Phaenomenon in the ideal World is at any Time &s;o &s;urprizing, as in tho&s;e Mo|ments, when the Faculties of bodily Sen&s;ation are lulled in Sleep; then the Imagination calls forth her ab&s;tract|ed
<PB N="21" REF="32">Train, and, being free from the Incumbrance of Fle&s;h, di&s;ports her&s;elf in the mo&s;t whim&s;ical Manner, and is at Liberty to form what Appearances, what Scenery, what Imagery, and what Rea&s;oning &s;he thinks proper. This I experienced in a lively Manner the other Night, and as I cannot help believing that any of my Readers would have been glad to enjoy the &s;ame vi&s;ionary Scene, I &s;hall, in&s;tead of a formal E&s;&s;ay, make my Dream the Subject of this Day's Paper.</P>
<P>I retired home to my Chambers a few Evenings &s;ince, in a very poetical Mood, and, to gratify the pre|&s;ent Cour&s;e of my Ideas, took into my Hand <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Georgies,</HI> which has always been con&s;idered by the Critics, as the mo&s;t perfect Poem, of the mo&s;t ac|compli&s;hed Poet The Delicacy of Expre&s;&s;ion, and every refined Beauty in the Turn of the Stile, have been finely treated by the elegant Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on;</HI> and, for my Part, I never look into it, but I perceive &s;ome con|cealed Stroke, which had before e&s;caped me. But the Enthu&s;ia&s;m which animates the following Pa&s;&s;age, &s;truck me the other Night in a Manner which never hap|pened to me before.</P>
<Q><L>Me quoque Parna&s;&s;i de&s;erta per ardua dulcis</L>
<L>Paptat amor; juvat ire jugis, qu&acirc; nulla priorum</L>
<L>Ca&s;taliam molli divertitur orbita clivo.</L></Q>
<P>The Fire and Rapidity in the fir&s;t Line, and the Rap|ture and Air of In&s;piration in the &s;ucceeding one, mu&s;t warm any Imagination, that has but the lea&s;t Spark of Fire. I could not help dwelling on it with Admiration; it opened to my Mind a Train of Images which gave me the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Plea&s;ure, and made &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion on my Spirits, that even in Sleep they continued to flow in the &s;ame Traces, they had before been thrown into, and thus my waking Thoughts were recalled to me with double Delight.</P>
<P>I thought that of a &s;udden I was hurried away to the Realms of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> and that I towered with
<PB N="22" REF="33">Rapture over the &s;everal Cliffs, which are frequent in tho&s;e Regions. The Air, methought, &s;eemed to be clearer than what I have ever met with; the Skies were brightened into the pure&s;t Azure; the Sun darted his genial Rays all around, and different Streaks of Light blending them&s;elves in &s;undry Parts of the Hemi&s;phere &s;erved to diver&s;i&s;y the Scene; the Country &s;miled in vernal Delight, covered with the mo&s;t chearful Green I had ever beheld. In one Part was di&s;played to View an ample Lawn, &s;tretched to &s;uch a Length, that the Eye lo&s;t it&s;elf; on the other Side pre&s;ented them&s;elves Meads and Gardens, and Laurel Groves. Hills there were, who&s;e blue Tops grew fine by Degrees, and le&s;&s;ened to the Sight amid the Clouds. From one of the&s;e i&s;&s;ued the <HI>Pierian</HI> Fountain, which, divided into &s;everal Rills, came tinkling down the Mountain, and at the Bottom all a&s;&s;embling into one general Re&s;ervoir, they there expanded them&s;elves into a plea&s;ing Surface, and formed a River, which watered all the Country round. Here I fell into that State of Mind, which is &s;o excellently de&s;cribed in the <HI>Plea&s;ures of Imagination.</HI></P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Then the inexpre&s;&s;ive Strain</L>
<L>Diffu&s;es its Enchantment; Fancy dreams</L>
<L>Of &s;acred Fountains, and <HI>Ely&s;ian</HI> Groves,</L>
<L>And Vales of Bli&s;s; the Intellectual Pow'r</L>
<L>Bends from his awful Throne a li&s;t' ning Ear,</L>
<L>And &s;miles; the Pa&s;&s;ions gently &s;ooth'd away</L>
<L>Sink to divine Repo&s;e, and Love and Joy</L>
<L>Alone are waking; Love and Joy &s;erene</L>
<L>As Airs that fan the Summer.</L></Q>
<P>I felt the mo&s;t ardent Ambition to gain the Summit of the Hill, but it was in &s;everal Places &s;o &s;leep, that I be|lieve I &s;hould never have reached it, if <HI>Apollo</HI> had not been favourable to the humble Prayer which I prefer|red. I did not build my Supplication upon any Merit in the literary World, but humbly pre&s;umed upon the
<PB N="23" REF="34">Delight which I always took in Works of Genius; and in <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Eye, the next Thing to a good Author is to have a Ta&s;te and Reli&s;h for the Beauties of fine Wri|ting. I was &s;truck with reverential Awe at the Sight of the God of Wit; and &s;uch Melody filled my Ears, &s;uch divine Harmony enchanted the Place, that I in|&s;tantly fell on my Knees, and wor&s;hipped the nine har|monious Maids, who cau&s;ed the heavenly Strain. They beheld each other with an Air of mutual Affection and Complacence; their Eyes were bright with Meaning, and I thought that, in Delicacy of Shape and Feature, they had a near Re&s;emblance to two Ladies known to the World by the Name of the HIBERNIAN BEAU|TIES.</P>
<P>After paying &s;ufficient Adoration, I withdrew from the Pre&s;ence of the Deities, and went round the Place, in order to view the Country more particularly. The greate&s;t Part of the&s;e Regions is portioned out by <HI>Apol|lo</HI> into different Tenures, &s;ome of them conveyed to the Per&s;on for ever, others for Life, and many for a &s;horter Duration. There are Man&s;ion-hou&s;es built on many of the&s;e E&s;tates, and the great Genius's, who have made a Figure in the World, have here fixed their Re&s;idence.</P>
<P>The Ancients &s;eemed to have by much the large&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, though a great Part of their Property was transferred to the Moderns. <HI>Dryden,</HI> be&s;ides his own hereditary E&s;tate, had purcha&s;ed a large Scope of Ground from the celebrated <HI>Virgil,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has bought near half of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Rent-Roll. Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> &s;pent mo&s;t of his Time in writing Prefaces and Dedi|cations to the great Men of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was retired to his own Hou&s;e, which was &s;ituated on the Banks of the River already mentioned, and the Country adjacent was laid out in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Ta&s;te. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was formerly very attentive to the Improvement
<PB N="24" REF="35">of his Land, and where the Soil did not yield &s;ponta|neou&s;ly, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted with Hot-beds. This Turn was now quite over with him, and his chief Care was to embel|li&s;h a Temple of Virtue and Happine&s;s, which he had rai&s;ed in the Middle of his Garden.</P>
<Q><L>There his Retreat the be&s;t Companions grace,</L>
<L>Chiefs out of War, and State&s;men out of Place.</L></Q>
<P>In Company with the&s;e celebrated Per&s;onages he main|tained his own Ea&s;e and Dignity; and though his Soul glowed within him, when &s;itting with <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> and <HI>Marchmont,</HI> he &s;eemed to receive a more near Delight from his <HI>Gay</HI> and <HI>Parnell.</HI></P>
<P>The great <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> fat upon a Cliff, looking abroad through all Creation. His Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were very near as exten&s;ive as <HI>Homer</HI>'s, but, in &s;ome Places, had not re|ceived &s;ufficient Culture. But even there &s;pontane|ous Flowers &s;hot up, and in the <HI>unweeded Garden, which grows to Seed,</HI> you might cull Lavender, Myrtle, and Wild Thyme. Craggy Rocks, Hills, and Dales, the Woodland and open Country, &s;truck the Eye with wild Variety, and o'er our Heads roll'd Thunder, deep and awful, and the Lightning's Fla&s;h darted athwart the &s;o|lemn Scene, while on the bla&s;ted Heath, Witches, Elves, and Fairies, with their own <HI>Queen Mab,</HI> play'd in frolic Gambols. Mean time the immortal Bard &s;at with his <HI>Eyes in a fine Phrenzy rolling,</HI> and Writers both in the Tragic and Comic Stile were gathered round him. <HI>Ari&s;ctle</HI> &s;eemed to lament that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had not &s;tu|died his. Art of Poetry, and <HI>Longirus</HI> admired him to a Degree of Enthu&s;ia&s;m. <HI>Otway, Rowe,</HI> and <HI>Congreve</HI> had him con&s;tantly in their Eye, and even <HI>Milton</HI> was looking for Flowers to tran&s;plant into his own Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>I was called off from &s;urveying the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the immertal <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> by repeated Peals of Laughter,
<PB N="25" REF="36">which re&s;ounded from an adjacent Grove. This, I &s;oon perceived, was occa&s;ioned by the irre&s;i&s;tible Hu|mour of <HI>Lucian, Cervantes,</HI> and <HI>Swift,</HI> while, at &s;ome Di&s;tance from them, <HI>Rabelais</HI> threw him&s;elf into a thou&s;and antick Attitudes, and brought together the mo&s;t ludicrous A&s;&s;emblage of Ideas, with all the &s;pright|ly Frolick of his wild Imagination.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard Steel</HI> fixed his Re&s;idence under Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s Roof, where <HI>Tickell</HI> was encouraged to tran|&s;late a Book of <HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Phillips</HI> was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in fini&s;h|ing the <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mother. Addi&s;on</HI> had before him &s;e|veral of the periodical E&s;&s;ays, which have lately been &s;ent abroad into the World, among which, methought, I &s;aw a Paper entitled the <HI>Gray's-Inn Journal,</HI> when *********************.</P>
<P>The Effect this had upon me was &s;uch, that my Vi&s;ion was immediately di&s;&s;ipated, and I awaked in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Serenity of Mind.</P>

<P>_I FIND my&s;elf obliged to po&s;tpone the E&s;&s;ay I intended for this Day, by an Occur|rence of &s;uch a Nature, that I think it in|di&s;pen&s;ably incumbent on me to take &s;ome Notice of it. I did not imagine, before this Incident, that a cold, trifling, frothy Writer, could have drawn &s;o much from me; but in the Defence of Truth, Ju&s;tice, and good Sen&s;e, I cannot controul my&s;elf from it; and as he has thought proper to record a Fact, I will in my Turn begin with one of as glaring a Die as I have ever known.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Pre&s;ents then be it known unto Po&s;terity, that in the Year One Thou&s;and Seven Hundred and Fifty-two, there really did exi&s;t a daily Author, who arrogated to him&s;elf the Title of <HI>In&s;pector General</HI> of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> that under this pompous Appellation he took upon him to pre&s;cribe Fa&s;hions to the Ladies, and Wire-Wigs to the Gentlemen; Intrigue to Rakes, and Ta&s;te to pretty Fellows; that he pe&s;ter'd the Town with Di&s;&s;ertations on Fo&s;&s;ils, Minerals, and In&s;ects, that never exi&s;ted but in his own Imagination, and from thence (emboldened by a kind of negative Ap|plau&s;e, that of being endured) he ro&s;e a Degree higher, and at a Time when our theatrical Entertainments were
<PB N="28" REF="39">under the ju&s;te&s;t Regulation, did his Endeavours to &s;ow the Seeds of Di&s;content in the Minds of the Au|dience, to &s;oment Divi&s;ions among them, and, contrary to all Law, to rai&s;e a Riot at the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Deary Lane,</HI> and in a public Paper ab&s;urdly encouraged them to throw the Sconces and Benches on the Stage.</P>
<P>It is hard to imagine to one's &s;elf the Ideas that will occur to Posterity upon Peru&s;al of this mo&s;t extraor|dinary Pa&s;&s;age: they will, I am afraid, believe their Ance&s;tors, at this Period relap&s;ing into the antient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the fir&s;t Inhabitants of this I&s;land. I have examined the Index to the <HI>Spectator,</HI> to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and <HI>Guardian,</HI> for the Words <HI>Riot, Benches, Sconces,</HI> &amp;c. and I cannot find any Thing of the Kind recommended under any of tho&s;e Heads, nor do I be|lieve &s;uch an Outrage to common Sen&s;e was ever offer|ed in any civilized Nation of the known World. The Authors of the immortal Performances ju&s;t mentioned endeavoured to cheri&s;h Good-humour, Good-nature, Social Harmony, and Good-manners. Theatrical Me|rit in their Time was promoted to the greate&s;t Elegance; every Thing that carried with it the lea&s;t Tincture of a vitiated Ta&s;te was by them attacked with the mo&s;t ma&s;terly Strokes; and now this E&s;&s;ayi&s;t would turn the Tables upon the&s;e approved Geniu&s;es, and, by extin|gui&s;hing all Sparks of Emulation, de&s;troy the only Means of heightening our public Entertainments, and di&s;aboli&s;hing Sen&s;e and Refinement among us</P>
<P>As I generally like to trace Things to their Source, I have been con&s;idering what could be the Motives that induced his <HI>In&s;pector&s;hip</HI> to this Proceeding, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I may take upon me to &s;ay I have di&s;co|vered the latent Cau&s;e. This Prodigy of Genius, this florid, witty, elegant, &s;en&s;ible, unexhau&s;ted <HI>In&s;pector,</HI> owed the fir&s;t Dawnings of his immoderate Fame (I
<PB N="29" REF="40">blu&s;h to tell it to a Pantomime Entertainmnt. And &s;hall he who&s;e Mon&s;ter-breeding Brain &s;pawn'd <HI>Orpheus</HI> and <HI>Eurydice,</HI> in who&s;e Head,

<BIBL><HI>POPE.</HI></BIBL></Q> Shall he look tamely on, and &s;ee his favourite Mon&s;ters expo&s;ed to Ridicule? May he not have &s;ome wild Production &s;till in Store? Such a Genius never can have done, and hence all that laboured Impotence of Ani|madver&s;ion which he has thrown out in two different Papers.</P>
<P>But to be a little more &s;erious. It is certain, that two contending Theatres have always indulged them|&s;elves in Strokes of Plea&s;antry upon each other; the <HI>Impromptu</HI> of <HI>Moliere</HI> was a Banter upon a rival Hou&s;e in &s;o polite a Place as <HI>Paris,</HI> and a recent In&s;tance will evince, that Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> has no Aver&s;ion to the Practice: It is notorious that a few Winters &s;ince he engaged a Per&s;on who&s;e Abilities con&s;i&s;t &s;olely in Mimickry, publicly to burle&s;que, as far as in him lay, Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> as a Man, an Actor, and a Manager. He has always given oblique Allu&s;ions whenever they came in his Way, and nothing has e&s;caped him from the Coronation in <HI>Harry</HI> the Fourth, down to the Ballad in <HI>Harlequin Ranger.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;hall not the Manager of the other Hou&s;e have leave to amu&s;e the Town in his Turn? It is ac|knowledged by the Writer who has occa&s;ioned my taking the Pen in Hand, that <HI>the Objects are well di&s;|po&s;ed; there is Humour in the Management of them, and there is Merit in the Song that explains the De&s;ign of their Introduction; what is more, there is Ju&s;tice, for the Subject
<PB N="30" REF="41">is worthy Ridicule.</HI> In &s;aying this he advances nothing but the Truth, but when he adds, <HI>Where is the Mode&s;ty of arraigning the Ta&s;te of an Audience, to an Audience,</HI> &amp;c. and again, <HI>It is unju&s;tifiable, it is cruel, it is not to be &s;upperted:</HI> In the Name of Common Sen&s;e, what wou'd he be at? Fir&s;t, there is Merit in it, then it is not to be ju&s;tified; there is Humour in it, then it is not to be &s;upported; there is Ju&s;tice in it, and the next Moment it is cruel. For Heaven's &s;ake, Mr. <HI>In|&s;pector,</HI> learn to be a little con&s;i&s;tent, and don't thus trifle with our Under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>When a Man will write in this &s;huffling Manner, blowing hot and cold, &s;aying and un&s;aying; when an Author, who pretends to in&s;truct, will run off from the Point, in a &s;nip-&s;nap Stile, with pert Que&s;tion and An&s;wer, down a whole Column of his Paper, it is not eligible to follow him further; therefore let his meandering Bri&s;kne&s;s run what Riots it will for the future, I &s;hall here &s;tate this Matter in a proper Light, and then have done with Controver&s;y.</P>
<P>Nothing, in my Apprehen&s;ion, &s;hews the Temper of this Nation, more than the Ferment their Minds are thrown into by little Divi&s;ions of this Nature. A real, or a mock Monarch, a Mini&s;ter of State, or a Ma|nager of a Theatre, mu&s;t eternally embarra&s;s their Thoughts. Every Thing among them mu&s;t be a Party-bu&s;ine&s;s; whereas, in my Opinion, while their Liberties remain inviolate, they &s;hould know no Party, but a Party of Plea&s;ure, and all Differences betwixt <HI>Tweedle-Dum</HI> and <HI>Tweedle-Dee</HI> &s;hould be &s;ub&s;ervient to their Merriment. The Field of Humour is open to both Play-Hou&s;es, and if, without Animo&s;ity, they will cull from thence, the Re&s;ult mu&s;t be, that the Public will receive more Entertainment from a &s;pirited Emulation than from an inactive State. This is the Ca&s;e among the <HI>French</HI> to this Day, and tho&s;e who
<PB N="31" REF="42">weep one Night at a Tragedy of Genius, are &s;ure to laugh at the &s;ame Piece, the Evening following, at the <HI>Italian</HI> Comedy. And if this Liberty is taken with the noble&s;t Productions of the human Mind, why &s;o much Tenderne&s;s for what is really ridiculous and unfit for the Stage? The <HI>Dramatis Per&s;onae</HI> expo&s;ed to Deri&s;ion, on this Occa&s;ion, are, if I am not mi&s;taken, a <HI>Lyon,</HI> a <HI>Bear,</HI> a <HI>Cat,</HI> a <HI>Dog,</HI> a <HI>Monkey,</HI> a <HI>Serpent,</HI> and an <HI>O&s;trich;</HI> an admirable Company of Comedians truly! but are they &s;uch re&s;pectable Per&s;onages, as to claim an Exemption from the La&s;h of Ridicule?&mdash;Ay, but <HI>Poor Rich! Poor Rich!</HI> &mdash; If by that pathetic Exclamation is meant that he is an Object of Compa&s;&s;ion, I own I have always thought him &s;uch, and do from my Heart mo&s;t &s;incerely pity him. But if, through a Depravity of Ta&s;te, or Debility of Mind, he has no Reli&s;h for the &s;ublimer Compo&s;itions of a Theatre, let not us therefore, like <HI>Egyptians,</HI> wor&s;hip Serpents, Dogs, and Monkeys; but, on the contrary, let us by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the politer Arts efface all Traces of Barbari&s;m, and pre&s;erve in all our public Exhibitions, a manly Af|fection for the Cau&s;e of Dramatic Poe&s;y, of Genius, and of <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI></P>

<P>_IN a former Paper, in which I gave &s;ome Account of my&s;elf, I was not in je&s;t when I told my Readers, that from a natural Sagacity of Sight, improved by Experience and Study. I had made a &s;urpri&s;ing Profi|ciency in the Art of Phy&s;iognomy. Among my pri|vate Acquaintance I have acquired &s;uch a Reputation in this Way, that I have known many Ladies, who would no more dare to come into my Company, than the young Romp, in <HI>Swift</HI>'s Vi&s;ion, would venture to &s;troke the Pari&s;h Lion, after &s;he had play'd at Hide and Hoop with <HI>Jackey</HI> in the Garret. Notwith&s;tand|ing this, I am &s;en&s;ible, the Majority of Mankind at this Day treat this Art as a mere exploded Impo&s;ture, like A&s;trology and Palmi&s;try, impo&s;ed upon the Credulous in dark and ignorant Ages. With them a Phy&s;iogno|mi&s;t and a Conjurer meet with the &s;ame Degree of Re&s;pect and Credit. But this Objection, I believe, will quickly vani&s;h, when we come to con&s;ider the Principles and Foundation on which the Art is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. I might here aptly bring in the Story of <HI>So|crates</HI> and the Phy&s;iognomi&s;t, but it is known to every Body; be&s;ides, Rea&s;on alone, and not Authority, is what I proceed upon.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="46">The great and almo&s;t incredible Wonder of this Ta|lent, con&s;i&s;ts in being able to di&s;cover the Pa&s;&s;ions, Virtues and Affections, even at the very Time that they are dormant in the Brea&s;t; &s;o as to point out a knavi&s;h Citizen at his Prayers; to know a Cut-throat, tho' he &s;miles; or a Fellow that has a De&s;ign upon your Fob, though he turns his Head another Way with an affect|ed Vacancy of Face; to mark out a Fellow who&s;e Mouth is open only to have it &s;top'd with a Bribe while he is declaiming again&s;t Corruption; or to detect the Niggard Hand of a Mi&s;er in the very Act of &s;eem|ing Genero&s;ity and Munificence. Yet all this and more may be done; and how it may be done, I will here in part explain; but I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed, if I do not reveal &s;ome Secrets of this <HI>Arcanum.</HI></P>
<P>Every Pa&s;&s;ion, every Virtue, and their &s;everal Modes, Mixtures and Combinations, which &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the hu|man Brea&s;t, have a corre&s;pondent Set of Mu&s;cles in the Face, or (if the Anatomi&s;ts will not allow this) they at lea&s;t operate differently upon the &s;ame Set of Mu&s;cles, which, when any Affection is Ma&s;ter of the Temper, are thrown into Motion, and this regularly produces a certain Configuration of Features, which is commonly known to us by the Name of <HI>Expre&s;&s;ion.</HI> This the Painters and the Statuaries can al&s;o atte&s;t, and to this they owe the very Soul of their Art; for by ob&s;erving the exact Shape that each different Pa&s;|&s;ion of the Mind gives the &s;everal Mu&s;cles of the Face, and by copying the &s;ame upon a lifele&s;s Sub|ject, it produces that agreeable Deception, which makes us imagine that this Di&s;po&s;ition of Features is an Ef|fect of Motion, communicated from a thinking Mind within, when it is only the Re&s;ult of their Skill in the Art of Imitation. The good Player goes another Way to work; he excites in him&s;elf the inward Mo|tions,
<PB N="36" REF="47">which we call feeling, and then the outward Ef|fect upon the Countenance naturally follows.</P>
<P>The Anatomi&s;ts will further inform us, that every Mu&s;cle of the human Body collects Strength, and ex|pands it&s;elf into larger Dimen&s;ions, by continual Exer|ci&s;e and U&s;e; as the Legs of Chairmen and others who are u&s;ed to carry Burthens, from the &s;ame Cau&s;e, &s;well to an uncommon Thickne&s;s. It follows then, that the corre&s;pondent Mu&s;cles of the Face, which expre&s;s any ruling Pa&s;&s;ion of the Mind, being more frequently exerted, grow out of Proportion, and be|come con&s;picuous above the re&s;t. Hence the Face con|tracts an habitual Air, marking the Features with &s;ome peculiar Ca&s;t of Character, which is legible at one Glance of the Eye. Any Body can di&s;tingui&s;h a Mi&s;er, a Coxcomb, a Leacher, or a Glutton, in every Cir|cum&s;tance of Life.</P>
<P>I know &s;ome well-meaning People may be &s;hocked at the Thoughts of indulging our&s;elves in the Practice of forming Opinions of Mankind by their Looks. This proceeds from a charitable Con&s;ideration, that as we make not our own Faces, we &s;hould not be ac|countable for them; but they who think in this Way take no Care to di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>good Face,</HI> the <HI>ingenu|us Vultus</HI> of the Ancients, that which <HI>Cicero</HI> &s;ays is the be&s;t Letter of Recommendation a Man can carry about him, from the <HI>Hand&s;ome,</HI> the mere Formation of inactive Features, and Glo&s;s of Complexion. The latter is the Gift of Nature alone, and is that which the Philo&s;ophers of all Ages have per&s;uaded us is of no intrin&s;ic Value; but the former, which we under|&s;tand when we &s;ay, &s;uch a Face is not hand&s;ome, but is extremely <HI>agreeable,</HI> is in every Man's Power to ac|quire; not by &s;tudying to put on a formal Simper, or &s;miling Complacency, before the Gla&s;s, but by recti|fying
<PB N="37" REF="48">the Mind, and furni&s;hing it with noble, generous, and virtuous Sentiments, which transfu&s;e them&s;elves into our Features, with an irre&s;i&s;tible Per&s;ua&s;ion, com|manding by a &s;ecret Kind of Fa&s;cination, the E&s;teem of every judicious Beholder. I never knew a &s;tronger In&s;tance of this than in the Face of a certain Noble|man, who, to a vulgar Eye, might appear to have an unplea&s;ing A&s;&s;emblage of Di&s;proportion and Irregu|larity.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved a certain Attorney in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter|hall,</HI> who, I think, has one of the <HI>hand&s;ome&s;t</HI> Faces I ever &s;aw; and yet, through the Lu&s;tre of his Eye, the Regularity of his Features, and Bloom of his Com|plexion, I could read &s;uch a &s;ettled Habit of the mo&s;t contracted Cunning, &s;o many determined Purpo&s;es of Cozenage and Fraud, that I prote&s;t I could not be ea&s;y while the Fellow &s;tood within Arms-length of my Pockets. Yet, to my A&s;toni&s;hment, upon Inquiry, I learned that &s;everal great Families had intru&s;ted this Man with their mo&s;t important Affairs.</P>
<P><HI>Eugenio</HI> is neither happy in a Face nor a Per&s;on; and, at the Time he &s;hould have learned to dance, was unfortunately employed in forming his Mind upon the Model of the Ancients. Hence he has contracted an uncouth Air, a College Look, and an aukward De|portment; yet, through all the&s;e Di&s;advantages, and a Cloud of unea&s;y Circum&s;tances, the judicious Eye can di&s;cover a Soul within capable of di&s;playing the mo&s;t <HI>divine Attributes of his God,</HI> with a Sublimity inferior to nothing but the Subject.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, ca&s;t your Eye upon <HI>Florio. Florio</HI> is a Man of Gaiety and plau&s;ible Addre&s;s. And there are &s;ome whom he hath per&s;uaded to think him one of the prettie&s;t Writers of the pre&s;ent Age. By his Dexterity in the Art of Plagiari&s;m, he pa&s;&s;es upon
<PB N="38" REF="49">the Crowd for a Man of &s;ome Learning; and I have heard him&s;elf &s;ay, that the Ladies think him a Man of Gallantry, and a Wit. No Man is more perfectly &s;atisfied with him&s;elf than <HI>Florio;</HI> he writes with the utmo&s;t Facility, without any Manner of Subject, and this he thinks is Stile, Simplicity, and Ea&s;e. Upon the whole, one might be &s;o far deceived at fir&s;t Sight, as to think <HI>Florio</HI> a pretty Fellow. Yet look at his Countenance, can any Thing be more vi&s;ible than the Furniture within? a confu&s;ed A&s;&s;emblage of Vanity, Arrogance, Cowardice, Dulne&s;s, Ignorance, and Con|ceit. <HI>Florio</HI> generally wears a Gleam of Chearfulne&s;s on his Face, and yet it is vi&s;ible that this is all forced, and, thro' the fal&s;e Appearance, <HI>Florio</HI> has an unea&s;y di&s;concerted Temper.</P>
<P>The Mortification in <HI>Sordido</HI>'s Leg had like to have gone too far, before he could prevail upon him&s;elf to be at the Expence of cutting it off. I attended him at the Time of the Operation, which, to the Surprize of every one, he bore with wonderful Patience; but while others were admiring his amazing Re&s;olution, I could plainly perceive by his Looks, that <HI>Sordido</HI>'s Compo&s;ure proceeded from the con&s;oling Thoughts, that he &s;hould hereafter &s;ave ju&s;t half his Expences, in the Article of Shoes.</P>
<P>I could point out a certain Reverend Gentleman, who wears the mo&s;t plau&s;ible Appearance of Humility, Sanctity, and Grace. Ask him familiarly how he does? and with a &s;olemn, thank&s;giving Voice, and the Whites of his Eyes turned up with pious Gratitude to Heaven, he ble&s;&s;es his God he is very well. Yet view his &s;hining, jolly Countenance with the &s;malle&s;t De|gree of Attention, and through this Gauze of Hypo|cri&s;y, you plainly di&s;cover a horrid Groupe behind, compo&s;ed of Pride, Gluttony, Cruelty, and Lu&s;t.&mdash;
<PB N="39" REF="50">Yet I'll engage, he'll ri&s;e in his Profe&s;&s;ion, for he can cringe and flatter with the be&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Prudi&s;&s;a</HI> is regular at her Devotions; &s;he goes twice a Day to Church; &s;he con&s;tantly has her Footman to carry her Prayer-book; yet I could ob&s;erve at a Vi&s;it the other Day, that in &s;ome of her Walks, there had been more Familiarity between her and this &s;ame Footman, who then handed the Tea-Equipage, than was altogether con&s;onant to the Character &s;he chu&s;es to a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>The unhappy <HI>Cali&s;ta,</HI> through the Per&s;idy of the Man &s;he once placed her Affections upon, and &s;ome Fa|mily Misfortunes that followed after, is now obliged to <HI>endure</HI> the Embraces of one of the mo&s;t dete&s;table Leachers upon Earth; yet in <HI>Cali&s;ta</HI>'s Soul, I can read the latent Traces of Cha&s;tity, Humility, and Love, blended with a Tenderne&s;s of Di&s;tre&s;s, that &s;ometimes flows into her Eyes, and adds &s;uch a melting Softne&s;s to her native Beauty, as nothing that is human can a|void being affected with. Yet to a vulgar Eye, the unfortunate <HI>Cali&s;ta</HI> appears no better than the common Tribe of Pro&s;titutes.</P>
<P>Not to produce any further In&s;tances at pre&s;ent, I can &s;ee &s;o clearly into the Characters and Di&s;po&s;itions of Mankind, that if &s;ome Folks, who&s;e Names I could mention, do not &s;hortly mend their Manners, I will take a general Tour through the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and unmask every &s;mooth-faced Villain that I meet. In the mean Time, if a certain Gentle|man, who generally wears a laced Frock, a Bag-wig, and a long Sword, does not lay a&s;ide his Project of &s;acrificing to a Set of Sharpers, with whom he is to go Shares, the good natured young Nobleman, who took a Liking to him for his Hone&s;ty, I will certainly let his Lord&s;hip know the whole Affair. And if a cer|tain
<PB N="40" REF="51">Lady of Di&s;tinction, who, by a Side Glance la&s;t <HI>Monday</HI> in the <HI>Mall,</HI> di&s;covered what intimate Familia|rities had pa&s;&s;ed the Evening before, between her and a certain hand&s;ome Fellow in a red Coat, does not in&s;tantly break off all further Commerce with him, I mu&s;t immediately inform her Husband; for I cannot any longer bear to &s;ee a Man of Con&s;equence and Sen&s;e hurt in his Honour by &s;o con&s;ummate a Coxcomb; but further, I mu&s;t inform the unfortunate Lady, that from a certain Symptom in her Paramour's Face, I can plainly fore&s;ee, he intends to make him&s;elf much hap|pier this Night, than ever he was in her Embraces, among half a Dozen of his Companions, at the Ex|pence of her Reputation and Honour.</P>

<P>This Way of de&s;iring a Man's <HI>Company,</HI> where he is not to &s;peak five Words, has in it &s;omething extraor|dinary; and though I am not fond of fa&s;hionable Vices, yet I could never prevail on my&s;elf to renounce
<PB N="42" REF="53">a Thing &s;o e&s;&s;ential in the polite World, as <HI>Card-play|ing</HI> is at pre&s;ent; and therefore I returned for An&s;wer, that I &s;hould do my&s;elf the Plea&s;ure of waiting upon her Lady&s;hip. It is not enough at pre&s;ent for a Man to know the World, to &s;ee into the Humours of different Peo|ple, to di&s;cover a lively Vein of Thinking upon all Topics that may offer in Conver&s;ation; unle&s;s he has learned to lo&s;e his Money gracefully, the&s;e Accom|pli&s;hments go for nothing, and wherever he vi&s;its, he is reckoned <HI>nothing but Lumber.</HI> Mr. <HI>Mellefont</HI> never wants Wit, and has many amiable Qualities, but not being a Card player, whenever he enters a Room, the Lady of the Hou&s;e is &s;ure to receive him, without &s;tir|ring out of the indolent Po&s;ture in which &s;he had com|po&s;ed her&s;elf. "Mr. <HI>Mellefont,</HI>" &s;ays &s;he, with her Eyes &s;wimming between Sleep and Wake round the Room, "pray &s;it down, Sir.&mdash;one is &s;o&mdash;I don't know how&mdash;this Weather."&mdash;But let Mr. <HI>Hazard</HI> with his Midnight Face make his Appearance; her Heart dances at the Sight of him, the Bell rings for the Card-Ta|ble, and the Hou&s;e is in an Uproar in an In&s;tant.</P>
<P>That I may not pa&s;s for <HI>Lumber</HI> among the Ladies, I have peru&s;ed with &s;ome Attention Mr. <HI>Hoyle</HI>'s very judicious and elegant Book on the Game of <HI>Whi&s;t;</HI> by which Means I can now return my Partner's Suit, lead through the Honour, <HI>Fine&s;&s;e,</HI> and &s;ometimes con|trive to bring about an agreeable <HI>See-&s;aw.</HI> With this profound Knowledge I was punctual to my Engage|ment, and, that I might &s;ee the whole Ceremony of the Proceeding, took Care to be pretty early in my Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>My Lady <HI>Tenace</HI> is a Woman of perfect Good-breed|ing, and has a very happy Flow of Spirits; her Ca|pacity is, perhaps, as exten&s;ive as that of any of her Sex; but from a con&s;tant Habit of attending to no|thing
<PB N="43" REF="54">but the odd Trick, &s;he has not laid up &s;o large a Store of Ideas, as &s;he might have done by a proper Improvement of her Under&s;tanding; tho&s;e Ideas which &s;he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, are in a con&s;tant Rotation, and &s;he never dwells long upon any Subject, but is always &s;ure to &s;ay &s;omething lively upon every Thing that offers. Her Lady&s;hip began to rally me with a deal of Plea|&s;antry upon my being a public Writer, when, as <HI>A|pollo</HI> would have it, a loud Rap at the Door &s;hook the whole Hou&s;e. I have often wondered at this &s;trange Din, with which, even though the Entry &s;tands wide open, our Ears are always to be &s;tunned upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions. As the Company comes to a <HI>Rout,</HI> it is po&s;&s;ible this may make Part of the Ceremony, and, be&s;ides the Plea&s;ure of alarming a whole Neighbour|hood, I &s;uppo&s;e the Ladies may think, that, what with the Thunder below Stairs, and the Lightning in their Eyes, they &s;ail into a Room with a greater Eclat.</P>
<P>This was the Ca&s;e with Mrs. <HI>Fidget;</HI> after &s;he had &s;eated her&s;elf in her Chair, twi&s;ted her Body two or three Times to compo&s;e her&s;elf, adju&s;ted the &s;parkling Cro&s;s upon her Neck, and given a Di&s;charge to her Fan&mdash;<Q>Lard, my Lady <HI>Tenace,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, I was ap|prehen&s;ive that I &s;hould not be able to wait upon your Lady&s;hip&mdash;My poor little Dog <HI>Pompey</HI>&mdash;the &s;weete&s;t little Thing in the World&mdash;I went, Me'm, the other Morning to fetch a Walk in the Park&mdash; a fine fro&s;ty Morning it was&mdash;I love fro&s;ty Wea|ther of all Things&mdash;and &s;o, little <HI>Pompey</HI> was with me&mdash;and if your Lady&s;hip was but to &s;ee the dear Creature pinched with the Fro&s;t, and mincing its Steps along the Mall&mdash;with its pretty little innocent Face&mdash;and &s;o, Me'm, while I was talking to Cap|tain <HI>Flim&s;y</HI>&mdash;your Lady&s;hip knows Captain <HI>Flim&s;y</HI> &mdash;five odious Frights of Dogs be&s;et my poor <HI>Pompey</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="55">all at once, Me'm&mdash;the dear Creature has the Heart of a Lion&mdash;but who can re&s;i&s;t &s;ix at once&mdash;and &s;o <HI>Pompey</HI> barked for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the hideous Crea|tures made their E&s;cape&mdash;The Hurt my little Dog met with was on his Che&s;t&mdash;and, Me'm, there is really Danger that an <HI>Empyema</HI> is now forming in his Side. And &s;o, Me'm&mdash;Lard, is not <HI>Barry</HI> a fine Man?&mdash;You have &s;een the <HI>Rehear&s;al</HI> to be &s;ure, Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI>&mdash;Well, to be &s;ure, <HI>Garrick</HI>'s a &s;urpri&s;ing little Fellow, his Eyes have &s;o much Life, and &s;uch Meaning, and &s;uch Fire, and he has &s;uch Variety! &mdash;They &s;ay &s;hort Aprons are coming into Fa&s;hion again.</Q></P>
<P>By this Time the Room began to fill, and it was Time to di&s;po&s;e the Company at their &s;everal Stations for the Night. Several Card Tables were accordingly &s;ituated in different Parts of the Room, and in an in|ward Apartment, a Brag-Table was prepared for tho&s;e who are fond of that Game. The Thoughts of the whole Company began immediately to flow into ano|ther Channel; they who were before happy in a mu|tual Intercour&s;e of &s;ocial Plea&s;ure, became of a &s;udden &s;ecret Enemies to each other, and every one had a De|&s;ign on his Neighbour's Pocket. I &s;hould think this &s;trange Scene would afford many nice Touches to the Pencil of an <HI>Hogarth;</HI> and it would not fail of being highly entertaining, to &s;ee the different Effects of the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion operating upon a Number of People, ac|cording to their re&s;pective Tempers, and various Ideas of Winning and Lo&s;ing. To mark this with Deli|cacy, and to blend the private Habits of each diffe|rent Character with it, would, in my Opinion, &s;how a nice Di&s;cernment, and be worthy of a ma&s;terly Hand to execute it.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="56">After a Rubber or two at Whi&s;t, I detached my&s;elf from the Party I was joined to, in order to take a Sur|vey of the Room, and I could not help wondering how Men, amid &s;uch a Pro&s;u&s;ion of Charms as the Ladies di&s;played, could fit &s;o cool and attentive to their Game; and I ob&s;erved that the Queen of Trumps (grote&s;que and unnatural as the Figure is) was the <HI>Venus</HI> of every Gentleman pre&s;ent. It is the Intere&s;t of the Ladies not to encourage a Game&s;ter; for if this &s;hould become the ruling Pa&s;&s;ion of the Men, the La|bours of the Toilet are all in vain; in vain may the Fair dre&s;s them&s;elves in Smiles; in vain heave the tender Brea&s;t; Cards have bani&s;hed Love, and &s;o adieu to the female Reign.</P>
<P>But this is not all: if this Ta&s;te continues, not only Love, but Beauty is at Stake, and the Odds are greatly again&s;t it. While the amiable, but delicate Sex, &s;it in painful Durance at a Card Table, the liquid Lu&s;tre of the Eye is extingui&s;hed, the Ro&s;es fade upon the Cheek, and unea&s;y Pa&s;&s;ions deface the Coun|tenance. <HI>Amanda</HI> is, at pre&s;ent, in all the Pride of Beauty; her is Stature tall and genteel; &s;he boa&s;ts a regular and elegant Set of Features; her Bloom glow|ing as the Poet's Fancy; a mild Radiance beams from her Eyes; there is &s;uch an inexpre&s;&s;ible Delicacy about her Mouth, that it is intirely the <HI>Beuche gracieu&s;e</HI> of the <HI>French,</HI> and over her whole Countenance is di&s;played the mo&s;t winning Sweetne&s;s; and &s;till Cards render <HI>Amanda</HI> unamiable. The Moment &s;he &s;at down to Brag, I could &s;ee the young Loves and Graces, that were ambu&s;hed in every Feature, &s;pread their little Wings, and a di&s;agreeable Expre&s;&s;ion immediately &s;ucceeded. I could not bear to hear &s;o exqui&s;ite a Beauty with a confirmed Voice tell a forward young Fellow, that "truly &s;he would not be bullied by "him;" and to &s;ee tho&s;e Lips, which were framed
<PB N="46" REF="57">for the tendere&s;t Purpo&s;es, gnawed with Vexation, was Matter of great Unea&s;ine&s;s to me. But the Sen|&s;ations, which Mrs. <HI>Pregnant</HI> gave me, are not to be expre&s;&s;ed. The Emotions, which &s;he &s;hewed upon fix Aces being di&s;covered in one Pack, will, I am afraid, bring her Child into the World with a convul&s;ed Set of Nerves, and I would venture to <HI>lay an even Bet</HI> that it will be marked with a Pair-royal of Aces.</P>
<P>When a Pa&s;&s;ion for Play becomes predominant in the married State, I believe it requires no very lively Imagination to conceive the Scene that mu&s;t en&s;ue; not to mention the Ruin of a Family, their own im|mediate Happine&s;s is de&s;troyed; as the Poet finely &s;ays,
<Q><L>Love &s;hall be bani&s;h'd from the genial Bed,</L>
<L>The Night &s;hall be all lonely and unquiet,</L>
<L>And every Day &s;hall be a Day of Cares.</L></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude, by congratulating with the Public, that we are &s;hortly to have a new Tragedy called <HI>The Game&s;ter,</HI> exhibited at <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> in which, as I am informed, the Effects of this unhappy Turn will be &s;et in a proper Light.</P>

<P>A Servant, in a gay Livery, brought me the follow|ing Letter a few Days &s;ince; and as it unfolds &s;ome of the Follies, which are apt to adhere to the Ladies, I &s;hall beg Leave to recommend it to the Peru&s;al of my Female Readers.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>To</HI> CHARLES RANGER, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS I perceive that you frequently detach your&s;elf from the more &s;erious Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Public Writer in order to mix with the <HI>Beau Monde,</HI> and that you &s;till retain great Attention to the amiable Sex, as you politely call the Ladies, I mu&s;t beg you will permit one of them to break in upon your Studies.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, Sir, that I have hitherto been of that Species of Women called COQUETTES; I was initia|ted into this Science in my greener Yearr, and the
<PB N="49" REF="60">whole Cour&s;e of my Education con&s;pired with other Circum&s;tances again&s;t me. My Mamma took early Pains to train me up in this Way, and the Attendants, I had about me, all joined to infu&s;e the &s;ame Senti|ments into my Mind; as if they had made a Point of it, to reader me egregiou&s;ly ridiculous. From a Child I promi&s;ed to make a fine Woman, as the Phra&s;e is; my Features were regular, and I mu&s;t add, did not want Delicacy; and I had a Bloom that greatly enlivened my whole Countenance. The Le&s;&s;on con&s;tantly rung in my Ears was, that <Q>Mi&s;s &s;hould hold up her Head &mdash;and put forth her Che&s;t&mdash;and one Day or other, &s;he would become a celebrated Toa&s;t, and then the Men would all be expiring for her.</Q>&mdash;This you may believe was flattering to my Fancy, and to give the la&s;t Fini&s;hing to my Accompli&s;hments for this State of Felicity, I was put into the Hands of a <HI>French</HI> Dan|cing-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>From this Gentleman I acquired a thou&s;and name|le&s;s Arts of Affectation, and he not only undertook the Direction of my Carriage in the graceful Movement of a Minuet, and the more &s;prightly Gambols of a Coun|try-Dance, but the Management of my Features be|came al&s;o Part of his Concern. He let me into the whole Secret of the elevated Brow, the langui&s;hing Glance, and the &s;leepy Eye; he in&s;tructed me when to di&s;play the &s;nowy Brea&s;t, to move with the ea&s;y indo|lent Carriage, to throw the whole Per&s;on into a grace|ful Attitude, and, after ob&s;erving that it is a Thing very rare in the&s;e Kingdoms, taught me the whole U&s;e of the Hands in every Circum&s;tance at Cards or Conver&s;ation; though it was not without &s;ome Pains, that I attained the Method of taking Snuff with a proper Air and art|ful Di&s;play of the Fingers.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="61">There are a thou&s;and Artifices to make up for the Deficiency of Chat in Company, and in all the&s;e I be|came as regular as a Piece of Clock-work. Add to this, that he recommended to me a great Variety of <HI>French</HI> Romances, Novels, and Memoirs of Ladies of Quality; and to complete the whole, he told me one Day with a mighty &s;erious Air, that I really had an immen&s;e Share of Wit. In this Notion I was further con&s;irmed by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lojeune&s;&s;e,</HI> my Hair-cutter; <Q>I a&s;&s;ure it you, Madam,</Q> <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> as my Hair was re|ceiving the proper Adju&s;tment from his Finger, <Q>you have indeed ver much <HI>E&s;prit.</HI>&mdash;Wherever I go to dre&s;s de Gentleman, it is all dying for you.&mdash; You have dem in Chains, Madam, &mdash; pon my Vord, &mdash; ju&s;t as I have dis Lock here in my Hand &mdash; pray hold your Head a leetle more a&s;ide, &mdash; and all de Ladies envy your Eclat, I a&s;&s;ure it you, Madam.</Q></P>
<P>Charmed with the&s;e Ideas of my Per&s;on, my Brea&s;t was fired with the Love of Conque&s;t, and the Thoughts of being a Wit quite intoxicated me; it was enough to turn my little Head; for let me tell you, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> Wit is the mo&s;t dangerous Thing a Woman can think of, becau&s;e it generally ruins the Share of Under&s;tanding Heaven has been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon her. I was not content to &s;ay or do any Thing in the common Way, and I read <HI>Rochefoucault</HI>'s <HI>Various Thoughts,</HI> in order to retail his brilliant Sayings again in Compa|ny; I am &s;ure you would laugh at me, were you to &s;ee the Pains I took to di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf in all Places of public Diver&s;ion. I think I remember &s;omething in a Poet that may help you to an Idea of my Be|haviour.</P>
<Q><L>She rolls her pretty Eyes in Spite,</L>
<L>And looks delightfully with all her Might.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="51" REF="62">
My Heart danced within me to hear <HI>Clarinda</HI> in the <HI>Su&s;picious Husband,</HI> utter with an Air, <HI>Any Woman can give Ea&s;e;</HI> I di&s;dained &s;o poor an Accompli&s;hment; and to cau&s;e Pain and Unea&s;ine&s;s was the Bu&s;ine&s;s of my Life. To &s;ee that the Fellows could not be ea&s;y with me, nor without me, was the Joy of my Soul; I read all our modern Comedies to glean up the Airs of the fine Women, and I was delighted, like Lady <HI>Betty Modi&s;h,</HI> to hear a tortured Lover bring out;
<Q><L>Yet for the Cur&s;e of human Race</L>
<L>This Devil has an Angel's Face.</L></Q></P>
<P>Whenever I could meet with a Man of Parts and Sen&s;e, my highe&s;t Ambition was to en&s;nare him; &s;uch a one I had a Pride to lead in Captivity, and in Spite of all his boa&s;ted Rea&s;on, to play upon his Pa&s;&s;ions, gave me the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Plea&s;ure. <HI>Favonius</HI> is one of this Cla&s;s; he has Under&s;tanding, without affecting it; his Wit is always tempered with good Nature and Politene&s;s; he is as hand&s;ome as mo&s;t of his Sex, and there is no Requi&s;ite in the Character of a Gentleman, but what he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. With the&s;e Accompli&s;h|ments he became my profe&s;&s;ed humble Servant, and though he made Love to me in a Manner hardly re&s;i|&s;tible, I delighted in tormenting him; if we were at a I lay together, I took Plea&s;ure in pointing out to him &s;everal young Fellows, whom I pretended to be charm|ed with; one I ob&s;erved had the fine&s;t Set of Teeth, and the prettie&s;t Smile in the World; another the hand&s;ome&s;t Forehead, and the mo&s;t delightful Eyes; a third had a becoming Head of Hair, and Abundance of Wit; and though an Under-actor perhaps was on the Stage, I vowed he was a charming Man. In a Country-dance, when I perceived his Spirits elevated, I
<PB N="52" REF="63">have &s;at down of a &s;udden, told him I was tired, and immediately after begged of him to let me take one Turn wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h a frightful horrid Creature whom I dete&s;ted.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this, I really was in Love with <HI>Favonius,</HI> but by my own Mi&s;conduct he has &s;lipt thro' my Hands. The amiable <HI>Elfrida</HI> has won him by her artle&s;s attractive Beauty. <HI>Elfrida</HI> has always formed ber&s;elf upon a Plan very different from mine; A&s;&s;abi|lity, Chearfulne&s;s and good Humour were the only Stratagems &s;he had Recour&s;e to; and the&s;e, joined to a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne Figure and a lovely Face, have made her happy in the Arms of a Man, with whom Life will be one Scene of Endearment.</P>
<P>This Incident, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> has opened my Eyes, and I now perceive, that I have been all this Time vainly aiming at imaginary Triumphs, and that all my Arti|fices were like the Wars of the <HI>French</HI> King in <HI>Flanders;</HI> &s;erving merely to extend Conque&s;ts, which are after|wards not to be a&s;certained. On this Account, I am now de ermined to dive&s;t my&s;elf, as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, of all my Follies, and to attach my&s;elf for the future to tho&s;e Rules of Behaviour, which, I am &s;en&s;ible, add new Graces to the Beauty of our Sex. To convince you that I am in earne&s;t on this Occa&s;ion, I beg you will annex to this Letter the inclo&s;ed Paper, by which you will &s;ee that I am entering upon a new Plan of Life without Delay, and your Compliance will great|ly oblige, Sir,</P>

<P>_THERE is not in the whole Province of an Author, a Point of greater Difficulty to attain than what is called a good Stile, an Expre&s;&s;ion which is in every Body's Mouth, but, as I take it, very little under&s;tood by the pre&s;ent Critics. I &s;hall endeavour, in this Paper, to reduce into &s;ome Sort of Order the &s;everal &s;cattered Thoughts which recurred to my Mind upon this Subject, in a vague Manner, a few Days &s;ince.</P>
<P>The Term <HI>Stile,</HI> if I mi&s;take not, is derived from the <HI>Stylus</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> which was an In&s;trument u&s;ed by them in Writing upon Wax, one End of it fa&s;hioned to cut the Letters, and the other formed to efface the Impre&s;&s;ion, whenever it &s;hould be judged proper. Hence <HI>Horace</HI> advi&s;es a Writer who would a&s;pire to the Fame of being worth Reading, to turn his <HI>Stile</HI>-very often, that is, to rub out and alter the Arrange|ment and Choice of his Words.</P>
<Q><L>Saepe &s;tylum vertas, iterum quae digna legi &s;unt</L>
<L>Scripturus, &mdash;</L></Q>
<P>From this turning and altering is deducible the Mean|ing of this Expre&s;&s;ion, which is a proper Choice of
<PB N="58" REF="69">Words in a regular and harmonious Di&s;po&s;ition. This requires a great deal of Art, and without a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the Force and Beauty of Language, can never be performed in any Degree of Perfection: In &s;ome we never can perceive the lea&s;t Tendency towards it, which renders their Works not very palatable to the Reader; and in tho&s;e who have by Practice cultivated this Ta|lent, it is an Embelli&s;hment to good Sen&s;e, gives a Lu&s;|tre and Elegance to every Thing the Author advances, and renders his Productions plea&s;ing and inviting. I be|lieve there are to be found &s;everal Critics, from who&s;e Works a good plodding Head may extract very &s;ound and &s;en&s;ible Ob&s;ervations upon all Branches of Literature; but while there are tho&s;e who treat the &s;ame Subject with a delicate Touch, he mu&s;t be lamentably dull that would have Recour&s;e to the former; and while <HI>Lon|ginus, Addi&s;on</HI> and <HI>Spence</HI> are not lo&s;t to us, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Commentators will lie mouldering on Stalls, and in the du&s;ty Libraries of in&s;ipid Pedants.</P>
<P>To attempt to lay down Rules for the Acquirement of this Quality, might perhaps carry with it an Ap|pearance of a tacit Declaration that I am Ma&s;ter of it my&s;elf, which I am far from the Vanity of believing; but it appears to me, that what Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> mentions as the chief Thing to be attended to in the Conduct of the Under&s;tanding, is al&s;o a nece&s;&s;ary Step towards this Accompli&s;hment. The Thing, I mean, is an Habit of <HI>Thinking in Train</HI> on whatever Subject the Mind may chu&s;e to expatiate upon, by which Means our Thoughts will follow in a natural Order, each ari&s;ing and grow|ing out of the former, and the whole connected in all its Parts, will by the&s;e Means be a regular Compo&s;ition, which at one Glance the Reader may take in and carry in his Mind. There is an A&s;&s;ociation between almo&s;t all our Ideas, and whenever one of them pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the Imagination, an whole Train is wakened into
<PB N="59" REF="70">Life; &s;o that if an Author has enlarged his Under|&s;tanding, and enriched him&s;elf with a tolerable Stock of Knowledge, he need not be apprehen&s;ive but his Thoughts will offer fa&s;t enough, and that too, if he has habituated him&s;elf to the Government of his Facul|ties above de&s;cribed in a regular Series. This would prevent that violent Straining very perceptible in &s;ome Gentlemen of the Quill, that Manner of flying off from one Subject to another in a wild incoherent. Man|ner, which &s;erves only to bewilder the Reader, who expects &s;omething of Method, and not being able to attend his Author into the Realms of Chaos and old Night, he throws him a&s;ide as a vague wandering Ge|nius, whom he can make nothing of.</P>
<P>I am aware that what has been premi&s;ed may ap|pear to an ha&s;ty Peru&s;er, digre&s;&s;ive from the Matter I fir&s;t &s;et out with; but Thinking is &s;o intimately con|nected with what is called Stile, that it is intirely co-in|cident with the De&s;ign of this E&s;&s;ay, and is &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial to a Compo&s;ition, that without it Elegance can never be expected, and with it, it is odds that it will never be wanting. To furni&s;h the Mind with Know|ledge, is a Rule of the able&s;t of Critics, and Words, &s;ays he, will never be deficient to cloath our Ideas.</P>
<P>To think clearly therefore is the original Source of good Writing, and he who con&s;iders things with Per|&s;picuity, will al&s;o aim at the &s;ame in conveying his Sen|timents to others. This is the main U&s;e of Language, and on this Account a good Writer will avoid all Affec|tation of Glittering, all fal&s;e ambitious Ornaments, all Prettine&s;&s;es, all Conceits, quaint Turns, Points and An|tithe&s;es, which never can give Strength to an Argument, and only &s;erve to enervate and corrupt the Imagination. As no Language can po&s;&s;ibly have a Competency of Terms appropriated to every different Idea, Recour&s;e was had to the Metaphor; which con&s;i&s;ts in transferring the Name of one Object to another, on Account of &s;ome
<PB N="60" REF="71">Re&s;emblance &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them; but by this, in the Nature of Things, it never could be intended that an whole Piece &s;hould be carried on in a String of borrowed Phra&s;es. Every body knows how cloying this Manner is in &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent Writers of the la&s;t Century; and it would not be hard to point out &s;ome of the pre&s;ent Tribe, who put off every Thing in &s;uch a motly Mixture of far-fetched Terms and Al|lu&s;ions, that the Sen&s;e is hid under a Flouri&s;h of tuneful Periods, which by the injudicious is called a good Stile and a pretty Flow. <HI>Cicero,</HI> the Father of Eloquence, and the excellent <HI>Quintilian,</HI> in &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages have condemned the two frequent In&s;ertion of Metaphors; and <HI>Vida,</HI> who was both a Poet and a Critic, has ele|gantly de&s;cribed tho&s;e Writers, who di&s;dain to expre&s;s their Thoughts in the Terms appropriated to them, and though, the Subject does not require it, mu&s;t need &s;et off every Thing in the delu&s;ive Colouring of figu|rative Language.</P>
<Q><L>Namqu&egrave; aliqui exercent vim duram, &amp; rebus iniqui</L>
<L>Nativam eripiunt formam, indignantibus ip&s;is,</L>
<L>Invita&s;que jubent alienos &s;umere vultus.</L></Q>
<P>I believe the late Dean <HI>Swift</HI> under&s;tood the true genuine Beauties of Writing as well as any Author, antient or modern, and I would advi&s;e the Reader to open any Part of his Works, and try whether he can find any Thing of this florid Manner, that at pre&s;ent &s;erves to <HI>elevate and &s;urprize.</HI> I am convinced that no Man of common Apprehen&s;ion need ever read a Sentence twice over in any of this Writer's Productions; his Method is per&s;picuous, and at the &s;ame time elegant, without fal&s;e Embelli&s;hments, and his Metaphors all bearing a palpable Allu&s;ion to the Thing they are introduced to &s;ignify. This is a Point which &s;hould be always be
<PB N="61" REF="72">con&s;idered, and even then they &s;hould not be &s;owed too thick, nor pur&s;ued with a pitiful Ambition to too great a Length. Whenever I find a Per&s;on erring on this Head, he appears to me in the Light of a Child, who has blown a Bubble prettily variegated and plea&s;ing to his Fancy, and then follows it in order to keep up the Illu&s;ion as long as he can. In &s;hort, it has happened in Language as in Commerce: What was fir&s;t intended to &s;upply our natural Deficiencies, is now by the Depra|vity of the human Mind perverted into a Vice; the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion on the one Hand has been &s;ufficiently condemned by all Morali&s;ts, and in the Eye of a ju&s;t Critic nothing can be more blameable than a Luxury of Words.</P>
<P>I know there are many other Corruptions which con|tribute to vitiate a true Ta&s;te; but I have dwelt longer on this, as it appears to me to be the reigning Fault of all our pretty E&s;&s;ayi&s;ts at pre&s;ent. But if Me|taphor is con&s;idered in the Light I have &s;tated it, as only an Aid to the Per&s;picuity of Language; it will no longer pa&s;s for an Elegance, when it is not &s;ub&s;er|vient to its original In&s;titution. Add to this, that all tedious Circumlocution &s;hould be quite exploded, tho' it is an excellent Subterfuge to him, who wants to &s;pin out the Sheet: To be a great while &s;aying and &s;aying nothing, helps out many a <HI>tritical E&s;&s;ay</HI> Writer. A Multiplicity of Words of the &s;ame Import, with a Profu&s;ion of Epithets, is al&s;o very u&s;eful upon a Pinch, but, I believe, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that there cannot be a greater Error; it &s;hould al&s;o be remem|bered, that every Species of Writing has its peculiar Manner, and its own proper Colouring, and whenever the di&s;tingui&s;hing Qualities of each are not pre&s;erved, whenever the different Boundaries are invaded, then all Propriety in Writing is de&s;troyed. A true Stile &s;hould be clear of all foreign Infu&s;ions, like the River
<PB N="62" REF="73"><HI>Mar&s;yas,</HI> which <HI>Curtius</HI> tells us glides pure and un|mixed within the Fortifications of a Town in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> free from any adventitious Waters to pollute the lim|pid Stream; but when without the Walls, it pours along with a more impetuous Current, and a &s;welling Surge, it no longer retains its original Name, but then commences to be &s;tiled the River <HI>Lycus: cum extra mu|nimenta &s;e evolvit, majore vi ac mole agentem undas Lycum appellant.</HI></P>
<P>After the Choice of our Words, the Arrangement of them is to be attended to, and in this con&s;i&s;ts a great deal of the Writer's Art. The Reference which the &s;everal Terms in a Sentence bear to one another; the Strength they acquire by being joined with proper Epithets, the Lu&s;tre they reflect upon an whole Period when di&s;po&s;ed with &s;uch an artful Brevity, that nothing is perplexed or entangled, are all Points of Moment in a Compo&s;ition, and at the &s;ame Time that they render every Thing clearer, they give Grace and Harmony to the Whole.</P>
<P>The Particulars here in&s;i&s;ted on are, in my Opi|nion, the Con&s;tituents of a good St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le, but as I am apprehen&s;ive I may have been all this Time giving a Specimen of a very bad one my&s;elf, I &s;hall here re|lea&s;e my Reader with this Ob&s;ervation, that Simplicity is the fir&s;t and greate&s;t Beauty in every Production of the human Mind.</P>

<P>_IN a former Paper I mentioned, that I belong to a Club, which meets once in every Week, at the <HI>Devil Tavern,</HI> near <HI>Temple-Bar;</HI> I then promi&s;ed my Readers to make them acquainted with the Nature of this Meeting, the Characters of the &s;everal Members, and the Oddities in my own Temper, which entitle me to a Place in this extraordinary Society, and therefore I &s;hall make an Account of it the Subject of this Day's Lucubration.</P>
<P>Our Club is called the <HI>Club of Originals.</HI> By an <HI>Ori|ginal</HI> we do not mean, a Character entirely new, and
<PB N="65" REF="76">&s;uch as has never been &s;een in the World before; but we intend by it a Per&s;on of an independent Under|&s;tanding, who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing Marks are not contracted by an affected Imitation of others, but are ab&s;olutely native and con&s;titutional in the very Frame and Temper of his Mind. As I had the Honour of filling the Chair the la&s;t Club Night, I &s;hall begin with my&s;elf, though I am aware that a public Writer &s;hould remain as much behind the Curtain as po&s;&s;ible, on Account of the Prejudices which ari&s;e again&s;t a known Author.</P>
<P>I have, perhaps, as many Whims in my Turn of Mind, as any Man whatever, and they adhere to me &s;o tenaciou&s;ly, that I cannot di&s;engage my&s;elf from them. Notwith&s;tanding all the Pains I have been at, I cannot induce my&s;elf to carry a &s;upernumerary Ace in my Pocket to a Brag-table; I could never contract an Intimacy in a Gentleman's Family, in order to debauch his Daughter, or carry on a De&s;ign upon his Wife; I had rather lo&s;e my Joke at any Time, than my Friend; and I am &s;o aukward, that I cannot at|tempt to bilk a Box-keeper. Add to this, I am far from being a Free-thinker, notwith&s;tanding the very great Reputation to be acquired by it. I am &s;en&s;ible, that the&s;e are unaccountable Oddities, and it does not e&s;cape me, that in &s;o enlightened and accompli&s;hed an Age as this, they mu&s;t &s;et a Man in a very di&s;advantage|ous Light; but the Truth of it is, they have taken &s;uch Root in my Mind, that I am apprehen&s;ive, I &s;hall never be able to attain that Elegance of Life and Ta&s;te, which is remarkable in &s;ome of my Neighbours.</P>
<P>The next who is to &s;it for his Picture, is a Gentleman of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Knowledge in all Branches of polite Literature. His Name is CANDID, remarkable for his Knowledge in Critical Learning; but what con&s;titutes the Oddity of his Character is, that he is a <HI>Critic</HI> with Good-nature. No Man has quicker Sen|&s;ations
<PB N="66" REF="77">than Mr. <HI>Candid,</HI> and hence it re&s;ults that in pe|ru&s;ing the Works of Antiquity, or tho&s;e Writers among the Moderns of allowed Reputation, their beautiful Pa&s;&s;ages &s;trike &s;o forcibly on his Imagination, that he admires them to a Degree of Rapture. It may be ima|gined that this Warmth of Temper hurries him &s;ome|times into a fal&s;e Applau&s;e, but his Judgment is &s;o deliberate, that he generally withholds his Admiration till he is perfectly &s;atisfied that the Sentiment and Diction are ju&s;t, and he is never known to be impo&s;ed upon by fal&s;e Embelli&s;hments of Stile, or tho&s;e ambitious Ornaments in Writing, which are cen&s;ured by <HI>Horace.</HI> To this Refinement of Ta&s;te, Mr. <HI>Candid</HI> has joined the mo&s;t fini&s;hed good Breeding, which renders his Company extremely de&s;irable, and he is a Source from whence tho&s;e of his Acquaintance derive many excel|lent Ob&s;ervations upon every Kind of different Wri|ting.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Abraham Gulliver</HI> follows in Order of Succe&s;&s;ion to the Chair, a Gentleman of very diverting Humours, and de&s;cended, as he him&s;elf informs us, from that very <HI>Gulliver</HI> who&s;e Travels have been collected, with &s;o much Accuracy, by the late Doctor <HI>Swift.</HI> The Love of recounting Adventures I believe runs in his Blood, and he frequently &s;ets the Company a &s;taring at the &s;urprizing Incidents he has met with. His Pa&s;&s;ion for voyaging was formerly &s;o prevalent in him, that he never omitted an Opportunity of <HI>&s;ailing for it,</HI> as he expre&s;&s;es it, and merely to gratify this Inclination he embarked in Lord <HI>An&s;on</HI>'s Squadron found the World. He has lo&s;t one Eye and Part of his Chin in that Expedition, but he does not repine at the Accident, as he &s;ays it is made up to him in the Acquirement of Knowledge, which, he in&s;i&s;ts, no Man can be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s, who has not cro&s;&s;ed the Line, and attempted the North-Ea&s;t Pa&s;&s;age. He has conver&s;ed with a
<PB N="67" REF="78"><HI>Bramin</HI> in the Ea&s;t; and there is no Place in the Map, of which he cannot give &s;ome Account. He certainly has laid up a large Fund of Knowledge, but that tinged with &s;o many Oddities, that he is a whim&s;ical Member of Society.</P>
<P>After Mr. <HI>Gulliver,</HI> my Friend <HI>Harry Wildair,</HI> whom I have mentioned in a former Paper, as my Coadjutor in the Articles of Intelligence, claims our Attention. <HI>Harry Wildair</HI> has a quick In&s;ight into Men and Man|ners, and No-body better knows the characteri&s;tic Marks and latent Foibles of all whom he meets in the &s;ocial Intercour&s;e of Life. Joined to this Sharp|ne&s;s of Di&s;cernment he has made great Enquiry into the Connections and Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mankind, and is actuated by &s;o &s;trong a De&s;ire of Novelty, that he has fixed his Re&s;idence at <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s,</HI> that he may have an Op|portunity of ob&s;erving the mighty Throng, which is con&s;tantly pre&s;&s;ing that Way. He can tell, by the Coat of Arms, to whom each pa&s;&s;ing Coach belongs, and if by Chance a Vehicle unob&s;erved before occurs to him, he is &s;ure to run after it through nine or ten Streets, in order to &s;atisfy his Curio&s;ity. In &s;hort, my Friend <HI>Wildair</HI> is all Spirit and Frolick; is foremo&s;t in every Scene both in high and low Life, and he is equally plea&s;ant upon the finer Foibles of the polite, and the &s;trong Humours of the inferior Cla&s;s, from whence it re&s;ults that he is never without a Fund of Gallantry and Humour, and his Conver&s;ation abounds with a gay and &s;prightly Variety.</P>
<P>The next of the Society is Coun&s;ellor <HI>Pla&s;tic</HI> of the <HI>Inner Temple.</HI> Coun&s;ellor <HI>Pla&s;tic</HI> was called to the Bar in the Year 1740, but the Death of his elder Brother &s;oon rendering it unnece&s;&s;ary for him to attend his Profe&s;&s;ion, he laid a&s;ide the long Robe, and has &s;ince indulged him&s;elf in the Gratification of his natural Ca&s;t of Mind. In&s;tead of Walking in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> he takes a Turn every Day in the <HI>Lyceum,</HI> or
<PB N="68" REF="79">&s;aunters in the Groves of <HI>Academus.</HI> In plain Terms, Mr. <HI>Pla&s;tic</HI> is a compleat <HI>Shafte&s;burian</HI> Philo&s;opher; like all the Gentlemen of that inclining, he has a po|lite Ta&s;te for the imitative Arts; his Imagination is warm and elegant, and he has entirely a <HI>Mu&s;e-like</HI> Apprehen&s;ion. With all this there is a Peculiarity in every Thing he &s;ays or does; the Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem cannot &s;tand his Art in Ridicule, which he calls the Te&s;t of Truth, and he adores a Deity of his own making. The Doctrine of Rewards and Puni&s;hments is to him abominable, and his Di&s;cour&s;e generally turns on Ideas of Beauty and Virtue. Be&s;ides the five Sen&s;es in com|mon with his Neighbours, this Gentleman has a mo|ral Sen&s;e, a Sen&s;e of Honour, a public Sen&s;e, an internal Sen&s;e, and many other Powers of Perception, not mentioned in <HI>Locke</HI>'s E&s;&s;ay, which is, in my humble Opinion, the mo&s;t accurate Hi&s;tory of the human Mind. In &s;hort, Coun&s;ellor <HI>Pla&s;tic</HI>'s Imagination has attained a great Degree of Refinement, and his di&s;intere&s;ted Bene|volence is frequently laughed at by Mr. <HI>Allca&s;h,</HI> who &s;tands la&s;t upon the Li&s;t.</P>
<P>It is owing to a Whim of this Gentleman's, that our Meeting is fixed at the <HI>Devil Tavern,</HI> as he has made a Re&s;olution never to go beyond the Bar. Mr. <HI>Allca&s;h</HI> is e&s;teemed to be worth half a Plum, and is now pretty well recovered from the Shock he received by the Reduction of Intere&s;t. As he has &s;pent mo&s;t of his Time in a con&s;tant Intercour&s;e with Scriveners and Stock-jobbers, he has di&s;covered the Artifices of that Cla&s;s of Men, and he is &s;atisfied from that partial View of Mankind, that he knows the World. He is extremely fond of a Maxim in <HI>Hudibras;</HI>
<Q><L>What is Worth in any Thing,</L>
<L>But &s;o much Money as 'twill bring?</L></Q>
<PB N="69" REF="80">This with him is the Te&s;t of Truth, which he oppo&s;es in his joking Way to the <HI>Shafte&s;burian</HI> Rule; he declares, that he had rather have a Sen&s;e of Money, than all the elegant Sen&s;es above mentioned; and he is a con&s;tant Attendant at Church, as he &s;ays, from a &s;incere Motive of Piety, though it is hinted by Mr. <HI>Pla&s;tic,</HI> that he does this becau&s;e he thinks it is his <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> to be &s;aved.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Members of the Club of ORIGINALS, which has been in&s;tituted upon the Commencement of this Paper, and as we are willing, in order to pro|mote the De&s;ign of it, to admit new Members, Pro|po&s;als will be received, and treated with the utmo&s;t Impartiality.</P>

<Q>Quid faciam Romae? mentiri ne&s;cio &mdash;
<BIBL><HI>JUVENAL.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE <HI>French</HI> are very often happy in an Expre&s;&s;ion, which cannot be rendered with equal Delicacy in any other mo|dern Language. Of this Sort is a Phra&s;e I have &s;omewhere met with, <HI>viz. Les petites Morales,</HI> which is u&s;ed by them to &s;ignify tho&s;e &s;ubordinate Points of Behaviour, which cannot be look|ed upon in the &s;ame Light with Concerns of an higher Moment, but are, however, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to our Conduct in Life, that they are thence denominated <HI>le&s;&s;er Morals.</HI> A &s;mall Share of common Sen&s;e will point the&s;e out to every Man's Ob&s;ervation; but as the Infringement of them is frequent, and very often attended with &s;erious Con&s;equences, it properly comes within the Province of a public Writer to correct the&s;e le&s;&s;er Deviations, and therefore I have &s;et apart this Day to animadvert upon a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of this Nature.</P>
<P>The Offence I mean is the notable Art of HUM|BUGGING, which &s;tarted up of late Years, and has made &s;uch an exten&s;ive Progre&s;s, that it is now enlarged into a general Fa&s;hion, and calls aloud for a CENSOR. And here it may not be improper to remind People of the true Definition of Wit, which con&s;i&s;ts in reconciling I|deas, between which there is no palpable Congruity, in a &s;udden lively A&s;&s;ociation. To this I will add, that Humour is the Talent of di&s;cerning the Oddities which con&s;titute the great Variety of Characters this
<PB N="72" REF="83">Kingdom is famous for, and exhibiting them in ridicu|lous Colours to the Eye of the World. Things being thus circum&s;tanced, I would ask the Tribe of HUM|BUGGERS, how far a plau&s;ible Lie, with a grave Coun|tenance, will give them a Preten&s;ion to either of the two Faculties above de&s;cribed? The Truth of it is, they are but pitiful Attendants on the Camp of fal&s;e Wit; and if they would con&s;ider how ea&s;ily it is to fal|&s;ify, and how hard to do it with Plea&s;antry, they would, in my Opinion, de&s;i&s;t from &s;o unpolite an Art, than which I do not remember any thing more gro&s;s, more &s;tupid, and more &s;en&s;ele&s;s. An Author of the fir&s;t Mag|nitude (I think the late Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>) ob&s;erves, that he never knew above one good Lie in his Life; and that one, I will venture to &s;ay, was told by him&s;elf, and we may believe was a Stroke of Humour, free from Scan|dal or Detraction, the di&s;tingui&s;hing Characteri&s;ticks of our modern Adventurers in this Way.</P>
<P>As one of the&s;e elegant Gentlemen is over his Tea in a Morning, his Hand is applied with great Sagacity to his Forehead &mdash; <Q>Let me &s;ee now, for an arch Hum&mdash;&s;omething cur&s;ed high for the Day&mdash;Ay, ay, I have it&mdash;A Suit is commenced in the &s;piri|tual Court again&s;t a certain Lord&mdash;It will be in&s;o|lent though to meddle with &s;uch re&s;pectable Charac|ters&mdash;Well, but there is Ill-nature in it, and &s;o it will do &s;wimmingly&mdash;as how&mdash;Why&mdash;he's mar|ried the fine&s;t Woman in the World&mdash;Her whole Sex envy her, and Envy vents it&s;elf in Malice and Detraction&mdash;that's the Thing&mdash;it will &s;pread a|mong them&mdash;Immen&s;e by G&mdash;d.&mdash;</Q> So away runs he, as quick as Lightning, to my Lady TATTLE-AID's Toilet, with a Face as long as a <HI>Dutch</HI> Epigram; then the Hum begins&mdash;<Q>I am extremely &s;orry for it, <HI>cries the Wag</HI>&mdash;It's a cruel Ca&s;e&mdash;<HI>Pray, Sir, what's a cruel Ca&s;e?</HI>&mdash;Why, have not you heard,
<PB N="73" REF="84">Ma'am?&mdash;My Lord&mdash;(hark in your Ear)&mdash;ab&s;o|lutely fact&mdash;two Wives&mdash;I'd lay all <HI>Lombard-Street</HI> to an Egg-&s;hell that it's true. Your Lady&s;hip knows <HI>Tom Wildfire.</HI>&mdash;<HI>Tom</HI> went this Morning for a Li|cence to be married to Mi&s;s <HI>Beverley,</HI> the great For|tune, and he brings the News piping hot from the Commons.&mdash;" "Lard, &s;ays my Lady <HI>Tattleaid,</HI> I don't know how it was &mdash; I never liked that Match &mdash;<HI>(and ca&s;ting her Eyes on the Gla&s;s with a con&s;cious Simper)</HI>&mdash;What &s;ignifies all her Beauty now?&mdash; Though &s;he was never my Beauty&mdash;I don't find that tho&s;e tall Women are &s;o much admired in public Places &mdash; Mrs. <HI>Needlework,</HI> bid <HI>John</HI> come round with the Coach to the Door,&mdash;and bring me my Fan, Gloves, and Capuchin in an In&s;tant.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the Affair is &s;ettled: away flies my Lady <HI>Tat|tleaid,</HI> on the Wings of Malice, to all Parts of the Town, and thus the agreeable News is wafted about. At <HI>White</HI>'s Bets are extremely high, a Wager being the only Te&s;t of Truth, which the ingenious Gentlemen of that Academy have been able to di&s;cover, after infinite Pains in the Search. A lo&s;ing Game&s;ter, who is o|bliged to drive into the City to di&s;po&s;e of a little <HI>South Sea</HI> Stock, gives the Hint there. The Go&s;&s;ips at <HI>Gar|raway</HI>'s have it in a Moment: At One it is buzz'd on <HI>Change,</HI> and the circulating Whi&s;per in the Boxes in|terrupts the Play at Night. At my Lady <HI>Trumpabout</HI>'s A&s;&s;embly, the Ladies are all in a Titter. <Q>Is it come to this? cries Mi&s;s <HI>Sparki&s;h,</HI> I'll brag a Guinea over&mdash;" "But is it really true, &s;ays Mi&s;s <HI>Whiteteeth,</HI> I &s;hall be very &s;orry for it&mdash;he! he! he!&mdash;Can one go to hear it tried?&mdash;I'll &s;end to be&s;peak Places.</Q></P>
<P>Plea&s;ed with the&s;e Ideas, the Ladies retire home from the Rout, &s;ink into a comfortable Repo&s;e, dream of Divorces, Separations, and unhappy Beauties, till the next Day the Cheat is di&s;covered; the Illu&s;ion vani&s;hes;
<PB N="74" REF="85">the noble Lord proves to be above the Reach of &s;o in|famous a Calumny, and his Lady, &s;uperior to Envy, moves in her Sphere with Lu&s;tre, Grace, and Dignity; while the Droll, who fir&s;t &s;et the Thing on foot, enjoys the Joke in &s;ecret, and laughs at the Tale his Faceti|ou&s;ne&s;s propagated. And in this is contained all the Wit, and all the Humour, and all the Fun of all the <HI>Humbuggers</HI> of the Age.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h that this Tribe had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the Days of <HI>Horace;</HI> becau&s;e then we &s;hould have them, under &s;ome proper Appellation, delivered down to Po&s;terity with the
<Q><L>Ambubaiarum collegia, Pharmacopolae,</L>
<L>Mendici, Mimi, Balatrones, hoc Genus omne:</L></Q> But I do not think that the polite Authors of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> &s;eem to have the fainte&s;t Idea of this egregious Turn. In all the Characters of <HI>La Bruyere</HI> there is no &s;uch Mon|&s;ter to be found; the Wits of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Time were ab&s;olutely ignorant of it. In the Reign of Queen ANNE, <HI>which</HI> (to u&s;e the Words of a fine Author) <HI>notwith&s;tand|ing the happy Days that have &s;ucceeded, every</HI> BRITON <HI>may yet remember,</HI> I &s;ay, in the Reign of Queen ANNE, when Wit, Humour, Imagination, and every elegant Talent, were in their highe&s;t Perfection, nothing of this Sort aro&s;e. In &s;hort, it &s;eems entirely re&s;erved to grace the Annals of the&s;e latter Days; and I make no doubt but it will give a &s;urpri&s;ing Eclat to the Pages of &s;ome future Hi&s;torian, to have it related in a pompous Stile, that in the Reign of his Maje&s;ty King <HI>George</HI> the Se|cond, by the Grace of God, King of <HI>Great-Britain, France</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> Defender of the Faith, and &s;o forth, the never enough to be admired Art of <HI>Humbugging</HI> came into Vogue, and was the Amu&s;ement of Tea Ta|bles,
<PB N="75" REF="86">the Delight of the Court, and the Study of Beaux and pretty Gentlemen, from whom it de&s;cended to all Ranks of People, and became the general Fa&s;hion of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of expatiating any further on this &s;prightly Ab&s;urdity, I &s;hall clo&s;e this Paper with a Pa&s;&s;age from Lord <HI>Shaft&s;bury,</HI> who&s;e Deci&s;ion upon Wit and Manners, I believe, will not be conte&s;ted.</P>
<P><Q>'Tis real Humanity and Kindne&s;s to hide &s;trong Truths from tender Eyes; and to do this by plea&s;ant Amu&s;ement, is ea&s;ier and civiller, than by a har&s;h Denial, or remarkable Re&s;erve. But to go about indu&s;triou&s;ly to confound Men in a my&s;terious Man|ner, and to make Advantage, and draw Plea&s;ure from that Perplexity they are thrown into by &s;uch uncer|tain Talk, is as unhand&s;ome in a Way of Raillery, as when done with the greate&s;t Seriou&s;ne&s;s, or in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Way of Deceit. It may be nece&s;&s;ary, as well now as heretofore, for wi&s;e Men to &s;peak in Parables, with a double Meaning, that the Enemy may be amu&s;ed, and they only <HI>who have Ears to hear, may hear;</HI> but it is certainly a mean, impotent, and dull Sort of Wit which amu&s;es all alike, and leaves the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Man, and even a Friend, equally in Doubt, and at a Lo&s;s to under&s;tand what one's real Mind is upon any Subject. This is that gro&s;s Sort of Raillery which is &s;o offen&s;ive in good Company; and indeed there is as much Difference between one Sort and another, as between fair Deal|ing and Hypocri&s;y, or between the genteele&s;t Wir, and the mo&s;t &s;currilous Buffoonery. But by Freedom of Conver&s;ation this illiberal Kind of Wit will lo&s;e its Credit.</Q></P>

<P>The following Letter is a Piece of Raillery upon Whim|&s;ies, which have a real Exi&s;tence; and it is written by a Gentleman of &s;o elegant a Ta&s;te, that I per|&s;uade my&s;elf a Production of his cannot fail to con|tribute
<PB N="78" REF="89">to the public Entertainment, and therefore I &s;hall not, by a longer Preface, detain my Readers from the Peru&s;al of it.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>To</HI> CHARLES RANGER, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE Bill lately &s;aid to be before the Legi&s;|lature for encouraging Indu&s;try (however extraordinary it might be in &s;ome Particu|lars) was, I do not doubt, extremely plea|&s;ing as to its general Purport to a Man of your Cha|racter. For my Part, I have ever beheld with Plea&s;ure the Motto, with which a certain eminent Phy&s;ician has long adorned his Chariot, <HI>viz. Non &s;ibi &s;ed toti,</HI> and am for promoting Indu&s;try in a more exalted Signifi|cation of the Word, than that in which it is mo&s;t com|monly u&s;ed; I mean, as it tends to the Good of Man|kind, without the lea&s;t Tincture of private Advantage.</P>
<P>When very young, I remember to have read in &s;ome Author, that the <HI>Turks</HI> are obliged to exerci&s;e &s;ome Trade or Occupation, which may contribute to the pub|lic Emolument, and that even their Emperors have no Exemption from this In&s;titution. It is true, a certain Sultan, a Kind of Wag, very artfully evaded the Force of the Law by the following Device. The Mu&s;ti, it &s;eems, had reproved him for being &s;o unmindful of what their Prophet had expre&s;ly enjoined, as to &s;pend all his Time in following Hawks and Hounds. The next Morning the wily Sultan &s;ent his trouble&s;ome Mo|nitor an hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent of wild Fowl and Veni&s;on, informing him at the &s;ame Time, that being convinced of the Ju&s;tne&s;s of his Reproof, he had in Con&s;equence thereof taken up the <HI>Trade of a Hunter.</HI></P>
<P>Far from approving &s;uch a Mahometan Equivocation, I began to con&s;ider wherein I could be of the mo&s;t ge|neral
<PB N="79" REF="90">U&s;e to my Fellow Creatures, without the lea&s;t Regard to any &s;elfi&s;h Views. I found my&s;elf in Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of an ample Patrimony, and con&s;equently a Sub&s;i&s;t|ence was out of the Que&s;tion. As to Divinity, Law, the Navy, or Army, I was aware that they carry with them &s;ome glittering Toy, which more or le&s;s attracts the Hearts of even the mo&s;t philo&s;ophic of their Fol|lowers. A <HI>Mitre,</HI> for Example, the <HI>Great Seal, a Flag at the Main-top,</HI> or a <HI>Truncheon,</HI> have their re&s;pective Charms, and no Doubt operate accordingly on the Conduct of their &s;everal Admirers.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e Allurements, I re&s;olutely &s;hut my Eyes, and determined to &s;et a noble Example, void of any the lea&s;t concomitant Self-Intere&s;t. Thus re&s;olved to dedicate my Time and Studies to the Service of Man (including Woman) I made Choice of an Occupation of univer&s;al Con&s;equence to the World, but of which none, except a few mercenary Pretenders, have ever made public Profe&s;&s;ion. Not to keep you any longer in Su&s;pence, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> the Profe&s;&s;ion I have taken up, and exerci&s;ed for &s;ome Years, is that of a <HI>Dentifri|cator,</HI> or what the Vulgar call <HI>a Cleaner of Teeth.</HI> I have heard with Rapture of a certain <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire 'Squire,</HI> who formerly applied him&s;elf with great Suc|ce&s;s, as well as A&s;&s;iduity, to cutting and curing the Corns of all tho&s;e he could per&s;uade to make an Ex|periment of his Skill. Not long &s;ince a noble Peer was famous for thir&s;ting after a few Ounces of the Blood of all who came near him, not from any Cru|elty of Temper, but purely on account of the exqui&s;ite and laudable Plea&s;ure he took in the U&s;e of the Lancet. Even <HI>Peter the Great,</HI> the immortal Refiner of the <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ian</HI> Empire, greatly delighted in drawing the Teeth of every one, who betrayed a Pain in tho&s;e Parts, by hold|ing his Handkerchief to his Mouth, by making wry Faces, or any &s;uch Indications. Of this I have been a&s;|&s;ured
<PB N="80" REF="91">by an Eye-witne&s;s of his Dexterity. To the common Soldiers he gave a Crown for every Tooth he deprived them of, which, indeed, encouraged &s;o many poor Wretches, who were ignorant of the Value of their Grinders, to undergo the Operation of an Impe|rial Hand, that the Officers remon&s;trated to his Maje&s;ty, that if he continued to make &s;uch Depredations in the Months of the Soldiery, he might disband his Troops, as they would be fit for Service no longer than they could eat.</P>
<P>To a Per&s;en of Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI>'s Sagacity, I need not remark how much my Profe&s;&s;ion of cleaning, beautify|ing, and pre&s;erving the Teeth, &s;urpa&s;&s;es the incon&s;ide|rate Zeal of that great Man. Every one is &s;en&s;ible how much we &s;urpa&s;s all other Nations in the Bravery of our Soldiers, and the Dexterity as well as Intrepi|dity of our Mariners; and yet it is well known, that all this depends on eating, and, of cour&s;e, on the Goodne&s;s of their Teeth. And as to our Beaux and Belles, how much the Force of their Charms is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a delicate Set of Teeth, is a Truth &s;o evident in it&s;elf, as not to need the lea&s;t Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>In Con&s;equence of the&s;e Reflexions, I applied my|&s;elf to &s;tudy every Author who has wrote on this Sub|ject. I went &s;o far as to take an <HI>Arabian</HI> into my Hou&s;e to in&s;truct me in his Language, that I might be able to con&s;ult the Writers of his Country in the Original, as well as the Authors of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI> After this I travelled over all <HI>Europe</HI> to conver&s;e with &s;uch as pro|fe&s;s this noble and delectable Operation. I have even put my&s;elf in their Hands, in order to acquire every Excellence, as well as avoid every Defect incidental to my brother Operators.</P>
<P>Some Time &s;ince, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> you favoured us with an Account of the Progre&s;s you had made in Phy&s;iog|nomy. You therefore will ea&s;ily believe what I am
<PB N="81" REF="92">going to relate of my own Sagacity. By a curious and exact Ob&s;ervation of the various Marks on the Teeth in different Per&s;ons, from the continual Friction they undergo, as well from each other as from the Tongue and Lips, I am able to di&s;cover what Pa&s;&s;ions their &s;e|veral Owners are &s;ubject to, and how far they indulge them, particularly as to <HI>Anger, Envy,</HI> or <HI>Love.</HI> It's an old Remark, that Proverbs are a Kind of Te&s;t of na|tional Wi&s;dom, and are either literally or allegorically founded on Truths of no &s;mall Importance. Now, I need only in&s;tance a few of the&s;e pithy Sentences, to convince the mo&s;t Incredulous what great Di&s;coveries may be made by a &s;kilful Contemplator in this Way. As for In&s;tance, <HI>Such a one has all his Eye-Teeth;&mdash; He &s;hews his Teeth, but cannot bite;&mdash;A third has a &s;oft Tooth in his Head;&mdash;This good Lady has a Colt's Tooth left yet;&mdash;Another has a liquori&s;h Tooth,</HI> &amp;c. I have made many Ob&s;ervations of this Nature, and even at fir&s;t Sight, I can di&s;cover whether a certain Mark be out of a young Lady's Mouth or not; in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> whether &s;he be in a State of pure Virginity, or has really given it up; or in what Degree of Dan|ger &s;he is of &s;o doing, by the Indications her Teeth contract from being frequently applied to the Sheets or Pillows. In &s;ome I have di&s;covered, after their having been in Company with two Si&s;ter-Graces, (a certain Dutche&s;s and Counte&s;s that &s;hall be namele&s;s,) whether their Teeth have been affected by the corro&s;ive Qua|lities ari&s;ing from Envy, or brightened by the Motion of the Lips, occa&s;ioned by the Smiles of a plea&s;ing Admiration.</P>
<P>I have already taken up too much of your Time, and therefore decline giving you an Account of my Travels (for the narrow Con&s;iderations of Wife or Fa|mily cannot long detain me at Home) in Search of all Opportunities of improving my&s;elf in the Art of pre|&s;erving,
<PB N="82" REF="93">and beautifying, tho&s;e u&s;eful Implements the Teeth. It is true, I was lately very near aban|doning my Profe&s;&s;ion, through the Treatment I met with from a certain great Prince in <HI>Germany,</HI> who pre|tending to want my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, no &s;ooner got my Fin|ger in his Mouth, than, clo&s;ing his Foreteeth, he held me fa&s;t in the greate&s;t Pain imaginable; and at the &s;ame Time he &s;poiled, with one of his Grinders, the nice&s;t Pair of Ruffles, which I had made up at <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> on Occa&s;ion of the Rejoicings for the Birth of the Duke of <HI>Burgundy.</HI></P>
<P>I am, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> with all Readine&s;s to rub your Gums, whenever you will plea&s;e to favour me with your Commands,</P>

<P>_WHEN an Author fir&s;t launches forth, a plea&s;ing Pro&s;pect lies before him; his Spirits are enlivened with the Novelty of his Enterprize; his Imagination pic|tures to him Scenes of Succe&s;s, and he thinks he has nothing to do, but to &s;pread all his Sails, and glide away to the Realms of Fame. Were an In&s;urance-Office opened for Adven|turers of this Nature, where, for a &s;mall Premium, the Event might be a&s;certained, he would hardly think it worth his while to intrench him&s;elf within tho&s;e Safe|guards; &s;o &s;ure is he of reaching his wi&s;hed for Haven. But how &s;orn is the flattering Dream di&s;&s;ipated into Air! Like <HI>Virgil's Aeneas,</HI> he no &s;ooner leaves the Shore, and &s;ees the Land gradually le&s;&s;ening to his Eye, than he finds him&s;elf embarked on a Sea of Troubles. Some &s;ecret Enemy, in who&s;e Brea&s;t an unju&s;t Preju|dice has long been rankling, immediately begins to counterwork his Progre&s;s, and a Storm is rai&s;ed again&s;t him. Calumny, Detraction, Scandal, and Malevolence blow a more violent Tempe&s;t, than the four Winds combined; the piercing Bla&s;ts of Enmity whi&s;tle round him, and his little Bark becomes the Sport of a trou|bled Element; now elevated as high as the very Hea|vens, and then at once let down to the profounde&s;t Bottom of the Deep. Should he be hardy enough to
<PB N="85" REF="96">think of weathering it out, he is be&s;et by a Shoal of Mon&s;ters, known in tho&s;e Seas by the Name of CRI|TICKS. The&s;e dangerous Animals of Prey are con|&s;tantly prowling about the Main, upon the Look-out, if I may be allowed the Expre&s;&s;ion, for &s;ome Object of their Rage. Him they in&s;tantly &s;urround, and all En|deavours to amu&s;e them from their fell Purpo&s;e are in vain; Tubs have been thrown to Whales with Suc|ce&s;s, and we have read of <HI>Arion,</HI> who found Means, by the lenient Airs of his Harp, to &s;often into Atten|tion a Group of Mon&s;ters, hungry, and ready to devour him; but no Per&s;ua&s;ive is &s;ufficient to appea&s;e the Rage of the CRITICKS, mentioned above; almo&s;t in|evitable Ruin attends the Man, who unhappily falls in their Way; and if, by the Light of &s;ome propitious Star, he &s;hould &s;teer his Cour&s;e clear of them, they have been &s;een to goad and bite them&s;elves with Spite and De|&s;peration.</P>
<P>To de&s;cend from this long continued Allegory: A public Writer, who undertakes to in&s;truct or entertain his Readers, has &s;o many Difficulties to cope with, that in&s;tead of wondering at the Dearth of good Papers of late, I am &s;urprized that any Advances are made to|wards it. The <HI>Pangs of de&s;pi&s;ed Wit</HI> are, perhaps, equal to <HI>tho&s;e of de&s;pi&s;ed Love,</HI> and one would imagine them &s;ufficient to extingui&s;h an Author's hone&s;t Emulation, and to determine him to think a Po&s;t of inglorious Ea&s;e more eligible than that State of Warfare, he mu&s;t be involved in as a Writer. It is to no purpo&s;e to plead in Bar to the Invectives of the rigid Cen&s;ors of the Age, a well-meant Endeavour to promote Chearful|ne&s;s and Good-humour: An Acquaintance of mine, who delights in parodying Pa&s;&s;ages from Poets, &s;ays, with &s;ome Plea&s;antry, <HI>Criticks have flinty Hearts; na Wit can move them; Authors mu&s;t be unhappy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="97">As the&s;e notable Refiners upon the Beauties of Wri|ting &s;tand in a con&s;picuous Light among the &s;everal Characters which do Honour to the pre&s;ent Age, it may not be improper upon this Occa&s;ion, to lay before the Reader a true Idea of the pre&s;ent State of MODERN CRITICISM, with &s;ome Account of its Parentage and Education.</P>
<P>ILL-NATURE is the Founder of the Family; in a Fit of petulant Delight this Per&s;onage was joined in Wed|lock to the celebrated Dame, IGNORANCE, The I&s;&s;ue of this happy Marriage was ENVY, who, being of a con&s;umptive Habit of Body, and no very amorous Di&s;|po&s;ition, was deterred for a long Time from any Thoughts of Matrimony; but at length meeting with MALICE, he took an immediate Fancy to her, and by a Sympa|thy of Soul this lovely Pair were led to a mutual Li|king for each other. MALICE was an old Maid, of a lean &s;hrivelled Habit of Body, and delighted greatly in Tea-table Chat. At fir&s;t the Relations of ENVY were di&s;gu&s;ted at the Match, as they imagined from the La|dy's Looks, that there was not any probable Likelihood of their having I&s;&s;ue, by which it was apprehended the Family would be totally extinct. But Things are not always to be taken by Appearances; though the new|married Couple lived together like Cats, con&s;tantly &s;cratching and quarrelling, they &s;till found &s;ofter Mo|ments of Dalliance, and in about nine Months, CRITI|CISM was u&s;hered into the World. The Tidings of this happy Occurrence were &s;oon wafted towards <HI>Grub|&s;treet College;</HI> Mother DULNESS rai&s;ed her drow&s;y Head, plea&s;ed with the Account of the &s;prightly Dunce, and all her Votaries hailed the new-born Babe. In <HI>Par|na&s;&s;us</HI> the Effect was far different; <HI>Apollo</HI> &s;tarted, and each amiable MUSE let fall a tender Tear: The tune|ful Lyre was laid a&s;ide, and ASTRAEA dropped her Scales.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="98">That the Lineage of this egregious Youth may be carried in the Mind with more Facility, I &s;hall here throw the whole Pedigree in one View before the Eye of the Reader.</P>
<P>ILL-NATURE&mdash;IGNORANCE</P>
<P>ENVY&mdash;MALICE</P>
<P>CRITICISM.</P>
<P>Like <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, the Infant was born with Teeth, and the Moment it perceived the fir&s;t Ray of Light, it began to hi&s;s. Several of the u&s;ual Play-things given to Children were immediately bought, but no|thing could allay our young Hero's Cries, until a Cat|call was given into his Hands, of which, by a Kind of In&s;tinct, he in&s;tantly found the U&s;e, and he &s;eemed to take a malicious Plea&s;ure at the Shrilne&s;s of the Sound. In proce&s;s of Time an Horn-book was procured for the young Gentleman, and at the fir&s;t Sight of it he grew extremely peevi&s;h, and &s;hortly after began to pull it to pieces. In this he was encouraged by his <HI>Grand|mother,</HI> who alledged it would &s;poil the Child's Eyes, but it is confidently &s;aid that he at la&s;t took to it of him&s;elf, but that he applied at random, in a very irre|gular Manner; and I am credibly informed, that he could not be induced to pur&s;ue the Alphabet in its na|tural Order, but that the fir&s;t Letters he became ac|quainted with, were <HI>D, A, M, N.</HI> It is a Que&s;tion with many, whether he ever went further; but after &s;ome Pains in the Re&s;earch, I have found from &s;ome &s;ecret Memoirs, that he really did learn to read the Title-Pages of Books and Pamphlets, in order the more effec|tually to abu&s;e them.</P>
<P>Our Youth in his Countenance had a blended Re|&s;emblance to his Parents, with a very great Air of his Grandmother. From his <HI>Grand&s;ire</HI> he derived a Di&s;|po&s;ition to all Kinds of Vice, and therefore the evil
<PB N="88" REF="99">Qualities of his Father thrived in a Soil admirably fit|ted for their Reception. Plea&s;ure he was an utter Stranger to, unle&s;s the Misfortunes of his Neighbours excited the mixed Sen&s;ations of that malignant Joy mentioned by <HI>Ovid.</HI></P>
<Q>Ri&s;us abe&s;t, ni&s;i quem vi&s;i movere dolores.</Q>
<P>Nothing could ever rouze him to an Emulation of others, whom he perceived to excel, but he &s;at pining and &s;elf-tormented at the Idea of their Merit, and hav|ing a Volubility of Speech from his Mother, he vent|ed his Spleen in Obloquy and &s;candalous Invective. In the&s;e Qualities he made great Improvement, and each Day added &s;ome new Accompli&s;hment, &s;uch as <HI>Impudence, Pertne&s;s, Ill-manners,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Being now arrived at Maturity, he grew wondrous fond of Coffee-hou&s;es, and turned out a complete <HI>Blood.</HI> He was con&s;tantly &s;een poring over the <HI>Magazines,</HI> and if he ever met with a Production of Genius, he &s;hewed great Perturbation of Mind, and was often heard to pronounce with &s;ome Vehemence;&mdash;<HI>Pi&s;h!&mdash;Exe|crable!&mdash;Damnea Stuff!&mdash;O G&mdash;d!</HI>&mdash;He went to the Playhou&s;e on the fir&s;t Night of every new Piece; the Players dreaded the Sight of him in the Pit; there he talked of Actors whom he never &s;aw; retailed Authors whom he never read; tore up Benches; grinned and chattered; hi&s;&s;ed and clapped; yawned and &s;lept. Having heard that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Art of Poetry was e&s;teemed among his be&s;t Performances, he bought at a Stall a certain curious Production entitled <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s <HI>Ma&s;ter-piece,</HI> which gave him a mean Opinion of the Ancients; and thence he took Occa&s;ion to ridicule all Kind of Learning, and became a Delegate, of his own Choice, to direct the Ta&s;te of the Age; and if a young Author &s;hewed any Traces of Elegance in a Compo|&s;ition, or di&s;covered a Vein of Thinking, capable of
<PB N="89" REF="100">further Improvements, he endeavoured to nip him in the Bud.</P>
<P>To conclude; CRITICISM has been upon Town for &s;everal Years, and &s;till continues in the Practice of every bad Quality, deducible from a weak Head and a corrupt Heart; but as I intend to per&s;evere in the Work I have undertaken, I will cut Matters &s;hort, and inform this Gentleman, and all his Followers, that af|ter this I &s;hall not &s;uffer my&s;elf to be diverted from the Drift of this De&s;ign. I think I &s;hall be able to of|fer &s;ome Compo&s;itions, not quite unworthy of the public Peru&s;al; and if I do not point out any unknown Truths, I &s;hall endeavour to place every Thing in a Point of View, that, I hope, will &s;ometimes give it the Graces of Novelty.</P>
<P>I &s;hall continue to prefix a Motto to each Lucubra|tion from &s;ome celebrated Author of Antiquity, and this not out of any Affectation, but becau&s;e from an early Ta&s;te for tho&s;e excellent Writers, many of their Beauties have in&s;inuated them&s;elves into my Imagina|tion, in &s;o lively a Manner, that they recur on almo&s;t every Topic. This &s;erves very often with the Cla&s;&s;ic Scholar, to place an entire E&s;&s;ay before his Eye at once; and to &s;ee a fine Pa&s;&s;age &s;tart into a new Light, and carry a witty Allu&s;ion to a Subject, in Appearance foreign to it, mu&s;t, in my Opinion, excite agreeable Ideas in the Fancy.</P>
<P>The mere <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader will lo&s;e this Plea&s;ure, but the re&s;t of this Paper cannot &s;uffer by it.</P>

<P>I HAVE been in this &s;trange Place about &s;ix Weeks, and find my&s;elf in &s;uch a whim&s;ical Situation, that I may truly &s;ay, with <HI>Petulant,</HI> in the <HI>Way of the World, I am like a Dog in a Dancing-School.</HI> Upon our fir&s;t Arrival here, we took a <HI>Fiacre,</HI> and drove to our Banker, who lives up four Pair of Stairs. As he was our Coun|tryman, we thought him the mo&s;t proper Per&s;on to direct us, and accordingly enquired whether there were any good Lodgings to be let in the <HI>Rue de</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="103"><HI>Boncherie;</HI> for you mu&s;t know, <HI>Harry,</HI> we were in|formed, before we left <HI>England,</HI> by &s;ome Gentlemen, who &s;aid they knew <HI>Paris</HI> very well, that we &s;hould take up our Re&s;idence in that Part of the Town. &mdash; But the Banker &s;miled at the Que&s;tion, and told us, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen had de&s;erted that famous Street ever &s;ince the <HI>Harlequin</HI> at the <HI>Italian</HI> Comedy, in making Love to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, told her, among other Profe&s;&s;ions of his Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>that he loved her as violently as my Lord</HI> Anglois <HI>did the</HI> Rue de Boucherie. He added, that he would take care to fix us in a proper Lodging, and conducted us to <HI>Peyri Bagneur,</HI> in the <HI>Rue Dauphine,</HI> who accommodated us with a very good Apartment. Our next Care was to equip our&s;elves in the Fa&s;hion of the Country. Ac|cordingly we &s;ent for a Taylor, and <HI>Jack Commons,</HI> who jabbers a little <HI>French,</HI> directed him to make us two Suits; which he brought us the next Morning at Ten o'Clock, and made compleat <HI>Frenchmen</HI> of us. But for my part, <HI>Harry,</HI> I was &s;o damned unea&s;y in a full-dre&s;&s;ed Coat, with helli&s;h long Skirts, which I had never been u&s;ed to, that I thought my&s;elf as much deprived of my Liberty, as if I had been in the <HI>Ba&s;tile;</HI> and I frequently &s;ighed for my little loo&s;e Frock, which I look upon as an Emblem of our happy Con&s;titution; for it lays a Man under no unea&s;y Re&s;traint, but leaves it in his Power to do as he plea&s;es. I mu&s;t not forget to in|form you, that we hired a <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Servant, whom they call here <HI>Valet de Place;</HI> and to him we entru&s;ted the Management of every Thing, which &s;aves us a great deal of Trouble; and I really believe the Fellow to be extremely hone&s;t, for I do not find that I &s;pend more Money here than in <HI>London.</HI> As it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to have a Coach in <HI>Paris,</HI> we engaged a <HI>Remi&s;e</HI> during our Stay; and indeed it was indi&s;pen|&s;ably
<PB N="93" REF="104">incumbent upon us to &s;et up an Equipage, for we commenced Lords immediately upon entering the <HI>Fauxbourg</HI> St. <HI>Germain.</HI>&mdash;Z&mdash;ds, <HI>Harry,</HI> the&s;e People think, that every Man who looks aukward, and throws away his Money, is an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lord; nay, they are &s;o liberal of this Title, that they call the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Taylors and Peruke-makers, who &s;ometimes pay them a Vi&s;it, <HI>des petits my Lords.</HI> You may believe, my Friend, I was very de&s;irous to &s;ee their Theatrical Entertainments. &mdash; I have indeed been at one or other of them every Night. They are d&mdash; &s;trange, Sir, &mdash; Not the Thing, by any Means. &mdash; I do not, it is true, under&s;tand the Language, but their Manner is quite different from ours.&mdash;The Players &s;eldom or ever throw out the Voice with any Vehemence, but &s;peak in as natural a Manner, as if they were off the Stage &mdash; That would not be borne with us. You know, however, the <HI>French</HI> are plea&s;ed with it, as they know no better. The fir&s;t Time I was at the Play-hou&s;e, I imagined there had been a Riot the Night before; for I ob&s;erved there were no Benches in the Pit: But, in this I was mi&s;taken, for there never are any Seats in that Part of the Hou&s;e; the Rea&s;on is, I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e a <HI>Frenchman</HI> could not &s;it &s;till during the Performance. With Re&s;pect to the Manner of living, <HI>Harry,</HI> it is in|tolerable. By Heavens! I &s;hould have been &s;tarved, if I had not luckily got acquainted with an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Abbe of <HI>Lombard College,</HI> one Mr. <HI>M' Manus,</HI> a very good Sort of a Man, though a Popi&s;h Prie&s;t. He has a cur&s;ed queer Way of talking indeed, his Accent being a Mixture of the Brogue and the <HI>French</HI> Cadence, and his Phra&s;es generally literal Tran&s;lations from the <HI>French.</HI> He is notwith&s;tanding a d&mdash;d hone&s;t Fellow, and will get drunk with any of his Friends at a Minute's Warning. If it had not been for this Gen|tleman, who conducted me to a little Place, kept by
<PB N="94" REF="105">one <HI>Kemp,</HI> where I got a Leg of Mutton and Turnips, and Beef-&s;takes, I &s;hould have been obliged to &s;et out Po&s;t for <HI>England.</HI> &mdash; 'Tis true, upon Honour &mdash; My Life was at Stake &mdash; I could by no Means live upon their <HI>Soup and Bully,</HI> and footy Kick&s;haws made of &s;tinking Meat. Their Wines, it mu&s;t be allowed, are pretty enough, when one is u&s;ed to them; but at fir&s;t they &s;eem prodigious weak: They have not half the Body of our Wines in <HI>England:</HI> But, that is ea&s;ily accounted for, the be&s;t Growths being always &s;ent to us; at lea&s;t <HI>Venables</HI> and <HI>Tomkins</HI> tell me &s;o. In mentioning <HI>Kemp</HI>'s, I &s;hould have told you of an ugly Scrape I had like to have fallen into. I got into Company with an Officer of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Troops in the <HI>French</HI> King's Service, and I began to hum him about Party Affairs; but, d&mdash;n me, he &s;oon gave me to under&s;tand that I was on the wrong Side the Water for that Fun, and in&s;i&s;ted, that I &s;hould give imme|diate Satisfaction. Gad, I reflected it would be con|foundedly &s;illy, to get pinked in a Popi&s;h Country, where they would not allow me a Chri&s;tian Burial; and &s;o I a&s;ked his Pardon, and the Affair was made up, by the Mediation of Abb&eacute; <HI>M Manus.</HI> This has cured me from attempting any Sport of that Kind while I &s;tay here. You will be &s;urprized, perhaps, that I give you no Account of the People. To tell you the Truth, my Friend, I do not know any of them. I went once to an Ordinary, and the Company were &s;o remarkably civil to me, that I began to think they had a De&s;ign upon me; but my Friend, <HI>Jack Com|mons,</HI> who has &s;tudied the Law, and knows the&s;e Things, tells me, this exce&s;&s;ive Politene&s;s proceeds from their living under an arbitrary Government. I cannot help laughing at the immen&s;e Number of <HI>Chevaliers de St. Louis,</HI> which I meet every where. The&s;e Gentlemen are as numerous here, as Knights
<PB N="95" REF="106">have been in the City of <HI>London,</HI> &s;ince the Year Forty|three. They wear a little enamelled Cro&s;s hanging to a red Ribbon, which is fixed in a Button hole of the Coat; and mo&s;t of them have a Streak of Dirt on their white Silk-Stockings, about an Inch above the Shoe, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, is Part of the Order. As to the Government of this Country, I have not thought it worth my while to enquire about it, for I am &s;atisfied with old <HI>England,</HI> and there will end my Days. I have had very few Amours &s;ince I left <HI>England,</HI> for I do not know how it is, I am d&mdash;d &s;hy of the Women here, they are &s;o devili&s;h &s;prightly&mdash;I know three or four of them, whom my Barber recommended me to, but they are not of the fir&s;t Cla&s;s.</P>
<P>To conclude, dear <HI>Harry,</HI> Mr. <HI>M'Manus</HI> has carried me through all the Curio&s;ities in and about <HI>Paris,</HI> and now my Time lies very heavy on my Hands; for as I have no Acquaintance, and am unwilling to enter into any Connexion with People in a &s;trange Country, I am at a Lo&s;s what to do with my&s;elf in an Evening. The Day I contrive to pa&s;s away tolerably, in &s;aunter|ing in the <HI>Tuilleries</HI> until Dinner, which brings all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> together at <HI>Kemp</HI>'s; from thence we adjourn to <HI>Procope</HI>'s, until it is Time to go to the Play, which kills the Time to about half an Hour after Eight; but when the Actors di&s;mi&s;s us, we are perplexed to deter|mine how we &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of our&s;elves, and are, in the End, obliged, in our own Defence, to return to <HI>Kemp</HI>'s, and play a Game at Whi&s;t. This Way of Life will not do with me, and in about a Fortnight you may ex|pect to &s;ee me, when we will laugh over the&s;e &s;trange Scenes at the <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI></P>

<P>_THE Club, of which I am a Member, and of which I have already given &s;ome Account in this Paper, is not a Con&s;e|deracy in Riot and Debauchery, but was in&s;tituted with a View of enjoying a plea&s;ing Conver&s;e, rather than of contending with each other for the Renown of the mo&s;t potent Con&s;titution, or the mo&s;t capacious Swallow. Accordingly our Di&s;|cour&s;e generally turns upon &s;ome Topic, that may &s;erve to di&s;clo&s;e the Humours of Mankind, or carry our Ta&s;te to a greater Degree of Refinement in the polite Arts.</P>
<P>An Evening of this &s;ort I was &s;ure to enjoy at our la&s;t Meeting, as the Chair was to be filled by Mr. <HI>Candid,</HI> whom I have formerly de&s;cribed as a very odd Critic, good Nature and Knowledge being Peculiarities re|markable in his Character. As &s;oon as the mutual Ci|vilities were exchanged between the Company, this Gentleman acquainted us with an Occurrence, which is really of a very extraordinary Nature. As he was walk|ing in the <HI>Piazzas</HI> at <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> he perceived a Man extremely bu&s;y in pa&s;ting up again&s;t the Walls, Adverti&s;ements of &s;o &s;ingular a Furport, that he was
<PB N="99" REF="110">induced to beg one of them, which was read out to the Club, and was in Sub&s;tance as follows:</P>
<Q><P>Lately launched at <HI>Deptford,</HI> a Ship called the <HI>Pantomime,</HI> now lying at <HI>Iron-gate,</HI> whereof is Owner <HI>John Lun,</HI> Burthen &s;even hundred Tons, mounts four and thirty Guns, and bound directly for the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> in que&s;t of Mon&s;ters of all Sorts; to cruize for &s;ome Time in tho&s;e Parts, and thence to bear away to the unknown World, to touch upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> and return home North about, in order to &s;tock our Theatres with the wilde&s;t Exotics that can be met with. Good Encouragement will be given to all Seafaring Men, who will &s;hip them&s;elves on board the <HI>Pantomime</HI> above mentioned; and, as a Corps of Marines will be requi&s;ite, di&s;appointed For|tune-Hunters, broken Game&s;ters, Hen-peck'd Hu&s;|bands, Under-actors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hall be received, and en|ter into Commi&s;&s;ion forthwith.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Apply to any of the Brokers on Change, at <HI>Sam</HI>'s Coffee hou&s;e, <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> the <HI>Bedford,</HI> or the Stage-Door of the Theatre in <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This Piece of Intelligence gave no &s;mall A&s;toni&s;h|ment to the re&s;t of the Company; but our Chairman de|clared, he had &s;een &s;o many &s;trange Turns in Life, that he did not doubt but it would be ab&s;olutely carried into Execution; and added, that it would certainly draw prodigious Hou&s;es, to have it mentioned in the Play-Bills, that the principal Parts, in a new Entertainment, will be performed by a wonderful <HI>Armadillo</HI> from <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> a <HI>Serpent</HI> from the River <HI>Oronoque,</HI> the famous <HI>Lanthorn-Fly</HI> from <HI>Peru,</HI> a <HI>Mermaid</HI> from the <HI>Ladrones I&s;lands,</HI> a &s;urpri&s;ing <HI>Camel,</HI> a <HI>Rhinoceros,</HI> and many horrible Ani|mals, <HI>being their fir&s;t Appearance on the Engli&s;h Stage.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Candid</HI> proceeded to ob&s;erve, that <HI>poor Shake&s;pear,</HI> who u&s;ed to flouri&s;h, like the Thorn at <HI>Gla&s;tonbury,</HI> in
<PB N="100" REF="111">the Depth of Winter, mu&s;t now entirely be de&s;troyed but however, to prevent, as far as in him lay, this threat|ning Mi&s;chief, he informed us, that he has drawn up, with no &s;mall Pains, a Pamphlet entitled, <HI>A mode&s;t Pro|po&s;al again&s;t aboli&s;hing Nature, and</HI> Shake&s;pear, <HI>at this Juncture,</HI> addre&s;&s;ed to <HI>David Garrick,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> with whom he hoped it would have due Weight, as all his Perfor|mances have di&s;played a true Reli&s;h for our great Poet's ma&s;terly Touches, and as the Cour&s;e of his Manage|ment has proved him to be a cordial Friend to Genius and Letters.</P>
<P>"And now, &s;ince I have mentioned Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI>" continued he, <Q>I had rather &s;ee him come out from the Murder of <HI>Duncan</HI> in the Character of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> with the Daggers in his Hands, than behold a Fountain of Tin, playing in Jetteaus, a real Ca&s;cade, or a Coun|try-dance by all the Mon&s;ters of the Creation.&mdash;I may be out in my Ta&s;te, but, there are Touches of Nature in the Play ju&s;t mentioned, which I &s;hall always reflect upon with Plea&s;ure; though I cannot help wondering, that <HI>Garrick,</HI> who always &s;trikes out the brighte&s;t Ideas, &s;hould attach him&s;elf to the com|mon Reading of a Line in the Part of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> when &s;o noble a Meaning is to be extracted from the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;age. The Thing, I mean, is, when he looks at his Hands, and breaks out into the following Speech.
<Q><L>With all great <HI>Neptune</HI>'s Ocean wa&s;h this Blood</L>
<L>Clean from my Hand? No;&mdash;this my Hand will rather</L>
<L>The multitudinous Sea incarnadine,</L>
<L>Making the Green one Red.</L></Q>
The la&s;t Line is generally pronounced, as if <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> meant, the GREEN-ONE, which, after the pompous Expre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Multitudinous Sea,</HI> would render it liable to the Imputation of an Anticlimax; whereas,
<PB N="101" REF="112">if it is under&s;tood, as <HI>making the Green,</HI>&mdash;ONE RED, i. e. the Colour of the Sea, which is of it&s;elf green, <HI>one intire univer&s;al Red,</HI> it would clo&s;e the Pa&s;&s;age with a Dignity re&s;pon&s;ive to what precedes, and ade|quate to the Va&s;tne&s;s of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Conception, as it not only keeps up the Image impre&s;&s;ed upon the Mind, by the Term MULTITUDINOUS Sea, but al&s;o height|ens the Horror of <HI>Macbeth</HI>'s Crime; the Blood he has &s;pilt being &s;ufficient to convert the natural Colour of the whole Ocean into&mdash;ONE RED.</Q></P>
<P>This Interpretation may, perhaps, not appear <HI>Ortho|dox</HI> to tho&s;e who are bigotted to <HI>Play-hou&s;e Tradition;</HI> but by our whole Club it was thought extremely ju&s;t, and Mr. <HI>Pla&s;tick,</HI> the <HI>Shaft&s;burian</HI> Philo&s;opher, received it with an Air of Enthu&s;ia&s;m; declaring, that it &s;ug|ge&s;ted an Idea, which expanded the Imagination, the more it dwelt upon it. After this, he offered &s;ome Doubts, which aro&s;e in his Mind, concerning a Pa&s;&s;age in the &s;ame Play, of which he conceived the Meaning, though he did not &s;ee the Propriety and Con&s;i&s;tence of the Figures. The Lines hinted at are in <HI>Macbeth</HI>'s Soliloquy concerning the Deed he was to perpetrate.
<Q><L>&mdash; I have no Spur</L>
<L>To prick the Sides of my Intent, but only</L>
<L>Vaulting Ambition, which o'er-leaps it&s;elf,</L>
<L>And falls on th' other.&mdash;</L></Q> Mr. <HI>Candid</HI> immediately rea&s;&s;umed the Di&s;cour&s;e. <Q>The fir&s;t Thing to be ob&s;erved, &s;aid he, is the Rapidity of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Imagination, and the quick Succe&s;|&s;ion of Ideas, which it &s;upplied him with. The me|taphorical Expre&s;&s;ion in the Ver&s;e,&mdash;<HI>I have no Spur to prick the Sides of my Intent,</HI>&mdash;gave Occa&s;ion to the Figure following, in the &s;ucceeding Line&mdash;<HI>But</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="113">VAULTING AMBITION, <HI>which o'er-leaps it&s;elf, and falls on th' other.</HI>&mdash;The Allu&s;ion is to a <HI>managed Hor&s;e,</HI> and AMBITION is repre&s;ented as a Per&s;on, who en|deavouring to vault into the Seat, by the Violence of his Effort, overleaps him&s;elf, and falls quite on the other Side.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Shaft&s;burian</HI> returned Thanks for the Light thrown upon this Place, and ob&s;erved, that the Inter|pretation is perfectly applicable to the Circum&s;tances and Conduct of <HI>Macbeth;</HI> when Mr. <HI>Allca&s;h,</HI> the Ci|tizen, interpo&s;ed, and told us, that, for his Part, he did not mind your Plays much,&mdash;that he went to &s;ee <HI>Garrick</HI> at <HI>Goodman</HI>'s-<HI>Fields,</HI> and could not help laughing to &s;ee the People cry at <HI>King Lear,</HI> when he knew it was all a Play, and paid his Money for it. This con|tributed to ruffle the Temper of Mr. <HI>Pla&s;tick,</HI> who in|&s;tantly harangued upon the <HI>Public Sen&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Moral Sen&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Internal Sen&s;e;</HI> but Mr. <HI>Allca&s;h</HI> was not to be beat out of his Way, and, in&s;tead of paying any Deference to this Doctrine, he de&s;ired an Explanation of a Line in <HI>Othello,</HI> where <HI>Iago</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Who &s;teals my Pur&s;e &s;teals 'Tra&s;h, 'tis &s;omething, nothing.</HI> <Q>Is there not, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> &s;ome Mi&s;take, in calling Money <HI>Tra&s;h,</HI> and <HI>&s;omething nothing?</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Chairman &s;miled at this Ob&s;ervation, which he promi&s;ed to con&s;ider at his Lei&s;ure, and for the pre&s;ent, proceeded to give a Correction of a Mi&s;take in <HI>Othello,</HI> in the fifth Act of which <HI>Iago</HI> &s;ays to <HI>Roderigo,</HI>
<Q><L>I have rubb'd this <HI>Gnat</HI> almo&s;t to the Sen&s;e,</L>
<L>And he grows angry.</L></Q> The common Editions give us the Lines in this Man|ner, and Mr. <HI>Warburton</HI> has done the &s;ame. <HI>Theobald</HI> is the only Editor who &s;aw the Ab&s;urdity. <HI>To rub a</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="114"><HI>Gnat,</HI> as he ob&s;erves, though ever &s;o gently, would rub it out of all Sen&s;e, and would effectually kill it. Yet, though he perceived the Error, it &s;eems, he knew not how to mend it. The Quarto Editions, Mr. <HI>Candid,</HI> told us, in&s;tead of <HI>Gnat,</HI> read <HI>Quat,</HI> or <HI>Quot;</HI> <Q>but <HI>Theobald,</HI> continued he, not knowing the Meaning of the Word, alters it to <HI>Knot,</HI> the Name of a Bird, and has a long Note to ju&s;tify the Correction. But the old Books are perfectly right, a <HI>Quat,</HI> or <HI>Quot,</HI> being a &s;mall Heat or Pimple, which, by itching, provokes us to &s;cratch it, and when rubbed to the Quick or Sen&s;e, it becomes hot and angry. The Word has not perhaps the Authority of any contem|porary Writer, but mu&s;t certainly be <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s, as it is &s;till u&s;ed in <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> the native Country of the old Bard; and in <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> where I pa&s;&s;ed a good many Months, a few Years &s;ince, it &s;till carries with it the Meaning already a&s;&s;igned to it.</Q></P>
<P>Our Chairman cea&s;ed here, and I apprehend, that the communicating this Remark will be agreeable to all the Admirers of <HI>Shake&s;pear;</HI> and I am apt to think, that many Pa&s;&s;ages of the Poet, &s;eemingly corrupted, are to be illu&s;trated, not from Books, but from the Cu&s;|toms and Dialect of the People; many of the Terms, which appear quite antiquated and ob&s;olete, being, as I am informed, &s;till u&s;ed in the Northern Parts of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Our Re&s;earches into Literature ended here, and the Company immediately withdrew, like &s;atisfied Gue&s;ts. If my Readers &s;hould ri&s;e from the Peru&s;al of this Lu|cubration with the &s;ame Reli&s;h, I &s;hall have gained the End propo&s;ed by this Account of our Tran&s;actions.</P>

<P>_MY Lucubration of la&s;t <HI>Saturday</HI> contained an Account of the Tran&s;actions of our Club; and as an Incident offered, after it broke up, which gave Ri&s;e to the Speculation of this Day, I beg that this Paper may be received as a Sequel to it.</P>
<P>The Majority of our worthy Members returned home, rather &s;ooner than is u&s;ual with them; at length, Mr. <HI>Candid</HI> and my&s;elf were the only Two remaining. As we drew nearer to the Fire, and to each other, our Hearts began to throw off all Re&s;erve; and the <HI>Conver|&s;ation,</HI> which before was vague and upon general To|picks of Literature, became gradually more confined, and at length it centered wholly on our&s;elves. Mr. <HI>Candid,</HI> among&s;t other Particulars, began to congratu|late with me on my Addre&s;s and Reputation as a Writer, and the Credit he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay I had acquired, in conducting the Paper which bears my Name. Your Reputation, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> &s;ays he, is at pre&s;ent in its early Bloom; the A&s;pect of the Public &s;hines on you, with a cheering Influence and Warmth. But you are not to imagine, it will be always thus. The Sky may be overca&s;t, and the enlivening Radiance intercepted; a chilling Fro&s;t may unexpectedly &s;ucceed, and nip all your Blo&s;&s;oms in the Bud. To drop the Metaphor,
<PB N="106" REF="117">continued he, the Countenance and Encouragement of the Public may be withdrawn, and at a Time when you are exerting all your Talents to de&s;erve and &s;ecure it. Popular Favour, and popular Prejudice, are the mo&s;t capricious Things imaginable. Di&s;gu&s;t will often ari&s;e, where no Satiety has been given; and mutual Confi|dence and good Liking will unaccountably degenerate to Coldne&s;s, Su&s;picion, and Indifference. Yet, it may be difficult to &s;ay, from whence this Alteration is occa|&s;ioned; or, whether it is owing to the Preten&s;ions of the Writer, or the Reader; but in this Ca&s;e perhaps, as in mo&s;t others, there may be Faults on both Sides. Exorbitant Claims are not &s;o ea&s;ily adju&s;ted; e&s;pecially where the Parties are equally unwilling to recede from their pre&s;umptive Rights. The Author is often un|rea&s;onable in his Demands for Fame; and the Public as hard to be gratified in their Expectation of Plea&s;ure. You are, at pre&s;ent, con&s;idered as a new Writer; the Delicacies you regale the Town with, are a Di&s;h un|thought of by your Fellow-Caterers for the general En|tertainment. But the&s;e in Time will become familiar to our Ta&s;te; your Wit will then be cen&s;ured to have lo&s;t its Poignancy, and your Humour its Reli&s;h. I was going to make a &s;uitable Reply to &s;o obliging an En|comium, when my Friend prevented me, by ob&s;erving that the Evening was now far advanced; and that it became us, as <HI>Originals,</HI> not to prolong our Compota|tions to the modern Midnight Hours of Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>In retiring to my Chambers, I could not forbear ru|minating on the Sentiments of my penetrating Ac|quaintance; and re&s;olved to throw together a few Re|flections upon what may be term'd <HI>Novelty</HI> in Writing.</P>
<P>I think then that judicious Imitation either of antient or modern Standards ought not to be &s;tigmati&s;ed as Larceny in an Author. He is certainly at Liberty to
<PB N="107" REF="118">draw from any excellent Model, whom he chu&s;es to copy; and that without incurring the ignominious Ap|pellations of a Plagiary or Tran&s;criber. Univer&s;al Cu&s;|tom will ju&s;tify the Practice. All the imitative Arts may be more particularly termed &s;o, as the &s;everal Ma&s;ters have frequently work'd after a Plan, that was fir&s;t &s;ketched out by &s;ome eminent Example. The &s;ame De&s;ign, diver&s;ified indeed with newer Decorations, as Genius or Invention prompted, may be traced in the different Performances of &s;ub&s;equent Arti&s;ts; &s;ometimes extended by the Addition of Circum&s;tances, which na|turally grew out of the Work; or contracted, by pruning the luxuriant Branches, and retrenching what appeared &s;uperfluous and unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>This general and di&s;tant Imitation, it will be readily owned, is allowable and ju&s;t; is what cannot perhaps be ea&s;ily avoided, where the Subject is treated with Propriety, and according to the Rules of Art. Thus <HI>Virgil</HI> followed <HI>Homer;</HI> thus <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> will always be re|garded as the Pattern either of grave, or of humourous Speculation; and <HI>Fielding</HI> will ever be a faithful Guide to the Adventurer in comic Romance.</P>
<P>But there is another Kind of Imitation, which is more direct and literal; and which con&s;i&s;ts in adopting the Sentiments and Phra&s;e of others. Of this the Le|gality is yet a Que&s;tion, and the Practice is generally judged to denote Poverty of Thought, and Defect of Imagination in the Writer. The Cen&s;ure is perhaps too rigid, or at lea&s;t may be moderated by &s;ome qua|lifying Con&s;iderations that &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves to our im|partial Attention.</P>
<P>The Tran&s;fu&s;ion of Wit, from one Language to another, when done with Elegance and Ea&s;e, has been &s;eldom turned to the Di&s;paragement of the Author who has Abilities to do it, when the Spirit is not &s;uffered
<PB N="108" REF="119">to evaporate, but retains all the Sprightline&s;s and Vigour which it po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in the Original. The Sentence which I have placed at the Head of this Paper is an Indul|gence to an Author, either for reviving ob&s;olete and antiquated Expre&s;&s;ions, or for the Importation of new ones, if the Liberty be u&s;ed with Mode&s;ty and Di&s;cre|tion. What <HI>Horace</HI> has thus ob&s;erved with regard to Words only, may be Parity of Rea&s;on be applied to Sentiment and Thought.</P>
<P>If the Language is enriched by the Addition of a &s;ingle Term or Phra&s;e, our Stock of Knowledge is made &s;till more exuberant, by introducing a Succe&s;&s;ion of new Ideas; in Proportion as the Value of an Ingot is &s;uperior to a &s;ingle Coin. To di&s;cover a new uncom|mon Vein of Thinking upon ordinary and beaten To|pics, requires that creative Power of Imagination, which Nature has imparted only to her Favourites, and with a frugal &s;paring Hand. Authors of inferior Genius have ea&s;ier Methods a&s;&s;igned them in their Pur&s;uit of Fame. It mu&s;t be their Merit to &s;elect the mo&s;t agreeable and plea&s;ing Imagery, to give delicate and graceful Turns to obvious and common Thoughts; and by this Means to recommend what is grown familiar to our Ima|gination, by the Novelty and Advantage of its Dre&s;s. A Statue which we have cea&s;ed to look on with the Eyes of Admiration, when removed to another Point of View, &s;hall &s;trike us with fre&s;h Plea&s;ure and Delight; a Plea&s;ure which re&s;ults entirely from the Novelty and Change of its Po&s;ition.</P>
<P>There is a Couplet in <HI>Pope,</HI> which I beg Leave to produce, as applicable to the Sentiments advanced.
<Q><L>True Wit is Nature to Advantage dre&s;s'd,</L>
<L>What oft was thought, but ne'er &s;o well expre&s;s'd.</L></Q>
<PB N="109" REF="120">And this very Sentiment, which I mention only as re|lative to the Subject, and which, on any other Occa|&s;ion, I &s;hould have indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed, our inge|nious Poet has taken from a Remark of <HI>Boileau.</HI> Wri|ters who argue with Preci&s;ion will often unavoidably fall into a Coincidence of Thought: Nature and Truth are invariable; and when &s;everal Pictures are taken of the &s;ame Object, if they are ju&s;t Copies of the Original, they will nece&s;&s;arily have a Likene&s;s to each other. I might add likewi&s;e, how difficult it is to offer what has not yet been &s;aid by any one, on Subjects that appear exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>An humourous Acquaintance, who often talks to me on this head, lays it down as an indi&s;putable Principle, that Compo&s;ition is only the Art of Stealing wi&s;ely: And indeed, as Matters are u&s;ually managed by our worthy Fraternity of Authors, if we &s;trike out the la&s;t Word, his Definition is perfectly unexceptionable. I make then no Scruple to declare, that I look on all the Wit, and all the Humour in antient or modern Languages, as good and lawful Prize; and that I &s;hall freely convert them to my own U&s;e, and the Public Emolument: But then I will take care to do it in &s;uch a Manner as &s;hall reflect no Di&s;grace to the Author from whom I borrow it; and that, if he comes at any Time either in Per&s;on, or by his Attorney, to demand his Property, he &s;hall find it employed in the very Way which he him&s;elf would chu&s;e.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, I give public Notice of this my In|tention to Mr. <HI>Town</HI> and all his Adherents, and I ad|vi&s;e them withal to keep a good Look-out, in order to detect and expo&s;e me.</P>

<P>_SINCE my fir&s;t entering upon the Province of a periodical Writer, I have been very inqui&s;itive concerning my&s;elf, and, while I have been endeavouring to glean Cha|racters and other Materials for the Embelli&s;hment of my Paper, I have made it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to collect all the Intelligence I could in relation to Mr. <HI>Ranger.</HI> With this View, I have &s;pent Two-pence in every Coffee hou&s;e within the Bills of Mortality, and I have &s;ome Time pa&s;t &s;tood li&s;tening to the Buzz of Fame around me; as the Lion is &s;aid, when he has fill'd the Fore&s;t with Terror, to &s;top &s;hort in his Career, in order to ob&s;erve the Effects of that Alarm, which his Roaring has occa&s;ioned among the Tenants of the Wood. Some, I find, are plea&s;ed that a Satyri&s;t is &s;talking abroad; others afraid of coming under his La&s;h; and different Reports prevail in different Quarters. In one Part of the Town I am a black Man, in another a fair one; now tall, now &s;hort; now fat, now lean; <HI>Engli&s;h, Scotch,</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> by Turns. At <HI>Sam</HI>'s Coffee|hou&s;e, in the City, I have a Place in the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e; at <HI>Bat&s;on</HI>'s I am a Phy&s;ician without Practice. From thence my Con&s;equence grows le&s;s by Degrees, and dwindles all along <HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI> and <HI>Fleet&s;treet;</HI> in&s;omuch that my Spirits would &s;ub&s;ide to a very low Ebb, did not my Fame again &s;tart up at the Coffee-hou&s;es about

<Q><L>Ut Pictura Poe&s;is erit, &s;imili&s;que Poe&s;i</L>

<BIBL>FRESNOY's <HI>Art of Painting.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_POETRY and Painting have been ac|counted Si&s;ter-Arts by Men of Ta&s;te in all Ages, and accordingly we find them both, in the Writings of all good Criticks, from <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Horace,</HI> down to <HI>Dryden</HI> and the <HI>Abb&eacute; du Bos,</HI> mutually borrowing Side-lights, and reflecting Lu&s;tre upon each other. They ju&s;tly have the Pre|cedence among the Arts of Imitation and De&s;ign, as they convey their Ideas by Signs more fixed and de|terminate than any of the others, and boa&s;t a more un|bounded Scope to cull and &s;elect from all Nature, in order to adorn and embelli&s;h the favourite Piece.</P>
<P>I am aware that it may be &s;aid, Statuary has very near the &s;ame Advantage; and, that the Arti&s;t in this Way may ob&s;erve the Knitting of a Joint in one, the Turn of a Neck in another, the Form of the Head in a Third, the Shape and Rounding of a Limb in a Fourth; and that, in &s;hort, from a Survey of &s;undry Objects, a complete and perfect Whole may be executed. But it mu&s;t be remembered, at the &s;ame Time, that Statuary has not &s;o ample a Field to range in, as the two fir&s;t-mentioned, and is therefore greatly inferior to both.</P>
<P>Painting, in one particular In&s;tance, &s;eems to gain the A&s;cendant over Poetry, being univer&s;ally under|&s;tood
<PB N="131" REF="142">in every Clime and every Age, whereas the latter is confined to much narrower Limits, both in Time and Place. A <HI>Raphael</HI> painted, and a <HI>Vida</HI> wrote at the &s;ame Period; and how confined is the Reputation of the latter, when compared to the exten&s;ive Renown which has attended the Name of the fir&s;t, through every Age and Country? The Aera may arrive, when, through the In&s;tability of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language, the Stile of <HI>Jo&s;eph Andrews</HI> and <HI>Tom Jones</HI> &s;hall be obli|terated, when the Characters &s;hall be unintelligible, and the Humour lo&s;e its Reli&s;h; but the many Per&s;on|ages, which the Manners-painting Hand of <HI>Hogarth</HI> has called forth into mimic Life, will not fade &s;o &s;oon, from the Canva&s;s; and that admirable <HI>Picture&s;que Comedy,</HI> the <HI>March to Finchley,</HI> will perhaps divert Po&s;terity as long as the <HI>Foundling-Ho&s;pital</HI> &s;hall do honour to the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Nation. A Picture &s;peaks the Language of every Nation, and is univer&s;ally felt and under&s;tood in many different Countries at the &s;ame Time, in this In&s;tance partaking the Advantages of MUSICK, which is how|ever &s;ubject to many Re&s;trictions, to which the Art of Painting is entirely a Stranger. The Caprice and Whim of different Nations prevent the Power of Harmony from becoming &s;o univer&s;al in its Influence; for the pri|mary Beauty of it, con&s;i&s;ting in an Imitation of the Sounds appropriated to our &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ions, and tho&s;e Sounds varying according to the Habits and Dialect of every different People, it follows of Cour&s;e, that the Mu&s;ick of any one Country mu&s;t undergo many Changes and Variations, before it can be adapted to the Ear of a Man, who has re&s;ided for any Time in another Kingdom.</P>
<P>This Inconvenience the Art of Painting is not &s;ub|ject to, and in this Re&s;pect has the Advantage over Poetry, though in almo&s;t every other Point, it is obliged
<PB N="132" REF="143">to yield the Pre-eminence. It has been long &s;ince ob|&s;erved, that Truth is agreeable to the Under&s;tanding, and fine Imagery to the Fancy; but neither of them, we find, affords &s;o inten&s;e a Plea&s;ure, as when the Pa&s;&s;ions are agitated and worked into a Ferment. We then attach our&s;elves &s;trongly to the Object, which ex|cites the&s;e Emotions; we are plea&s;ed to be wakened from a State of &s;till Life; and it is a Gratification to our moral Sen&s;e, to find our Hearts &s;en&s;ible and alive to tho&s;e Sen&s;ations, which are the Ornament of our Nature. This being the Ca&s;e, I believe, it may be a&s;|&s;erted without incurring the Danger of a Controver&s;y, that Poetry boa&s;ts this Power over the Pa&s;&s;ions beyond any other Art, at the &s;ame Time that it is a Vehicle for In&s;truction, and derives much of its Beauty from the Scenes of picture&s;que Imagination. Painting indeed partakes &s;ufficiently of the&s;e Qualities, to entitle her to the Name of Si&s;ter, has many Features like, and in the Execution of her De&s;igns is mo&s;tly directed by the &s;ame Rules. Both mu&s;t have Unity of Action and Unity of Character, and both have a Latitude to in|troduce &s;ubordinate Per&s;onages, concerned in the main Bu&s;ine&s;s, and to exhibit them in proper Attitudes. A Metaphor may be as bold in Painting as in Poetry; an Allegory may be as in&s;tructive and plea&s;ing to the Fancy upon Canva&s;s, as in the written Page; what the Critics call Machinery, may be di&s;played in as elegant Strockes with the Pencil as with the Pen; the Fairy-way of Writing, mentioned by <HI>Dryden,</HI> may be made U&s;e of in Colours, and the Fancy of the Arti&s;t, like a new Creation, may &s;tart to the Eye an whole Race of ima|ginary Beings. Some of the fine&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages in Epic and Dramatic Poe&s;y, are tho&s;e, where a Conflict is marked between &s;everal warring Pa&s;&s;ions; Painting throws the&s;e immediately before the Eye, and in Tints
<PB N="133" REF="144">artfully blended, the nice A&s;&s;emblage is delineated in the mo&s;t &s;triking Manner. A further In&s;tance of the Congruity between the&s;e two Arts, is, that when a Poet has been lavi&s;h in a De&s;cription, the be&s;t Method of examining the Ju&s;tne&s;s of it is, to con&s;ider what Kind of Figure it would make upon Canva&s;s; and on the other Hand, the De&s;criptions, which we find in the Poets, may &s;erve to &s;upply Hints and In&s;truction to the Painter of Ta&s;te and Poetick Imagination. Add to this, that, as the chief Beauty of Poetick Diction does not con&s;i&s;t in a Profu&s;ion of Ornaments, high Meta|phors, and a Flouri&s;h of Words, &s;o in the other, Co|lours too rich and glowing are di&s;approved, and the Excellence of both Arts, is &s;een in regular De&s;igns, and a ju&s;t Imitation of Nature.</P>
<P>The Ancients were enthu&s;ia&s;tick Admirers of all the imitative Arts, particularly Painting, and upon all Oc|ca&s;ions, we find them expre&s;&s;ing a Ta&s;te for the Pro|ductions of the famous Arti&s;ts. Accordingly their Poets &s;eize every Opportunity of de&s;cribing a Picture, a Piece of Sculpture, or any of the Works of the Loom. <HI>Ovid</HI> never omits it, where it naturally grows out of his Subject, and <HI>Virgil</HI> never &s;eems more delighted than when he is laying before our Eyes the Shield of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> or, like a &s;kilful Virtuo&s;o, pointing out to our Ob&s;ervation, the Beauties of a fine Painting:
<Q><L>Artificumque manus inter &s;e operumque laborem</L>
<L>Miratur&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>The Plea&s;ure in this Ca&s;e is <HI>redoubled</HI> upon the Mind, &s;pringing from a twofold Source; for the Delight we take in all poetick De&s;cription, is chiefly owing to the natural Love we have for Imitation, which affords an
<PB N="134" REF="145">Opportunity of comparing the Tran&s;cript with the ori|ginal Object; and, when we peru&s;e the De&s;cription of a Picture, we admire not only the Poet's Repre&s;entation of it, but the Talent of the Arti&s;t, who has thus con|trived to delineate by his Pencil &s;o exact a Re&s;emblance of Things, which have their Exi&s;tence in Nature; and thus the Mind has two Arts to examine at once, and dwells between them both in a Su&s;pen&s;e of Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I have always admired the De&s;cription in the fir&s;t <HI>Aeneid</HI> of that exqui&s;ite Piece of Painting of the Wars at <HI>Troy;</HI> and I think, the Poet's Account of it may &s;ug|ge&s;t to us &s;ome Notion of the &s;ublime Ideas he enter|tained of the Si&s;ter-Art of Poetry. All the Figures, which he mentions, are bold and animated; every Thing is in Motion, and, if I may be allowed to apply a Line of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s,
<Q>All Matter quick and bur&s;ting into Life.</Q>
What an Image have we of the <HI>Trojans</HI> repelling the Enemy, and of <HI>Achilles,</HI> with his nodding Plume, thun|dering at their Heels in his Turn? You think you hear the Sounding of his Carr, and you imagine you &s;ee him with his Arm aloft in Act to &s;trike.</P>
<Q><L>Hac fugerent Danai, premeret Trojana juventus;</L>
<L><HI>Hac Phryges,</HI> INSTARET CURRU CRISTATUS ACHILLES.</L></Q>
<P>The Situation of <HI>Troilus</HI> has been often admired, and the Proce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Nymphs will always ex|cite the tendere&s;t Sentiments, and, I dare affirm, a finer Groupe was never imagined. Their de|jected Looks, their di&s;hevelled Hair, and the beating of their Brea&s;ts, are all &s;triking Circum&s;tances.</P>
<Q><PB N="135" REF="146">
<L>Interea ad Templum non aequae Palladis ibant</L>
<L>Crinibus Iliades pa&s;&s;is, peplumque ferebant</L>
<L>Suppliciter tri&s;tes, &amp; tun&s;ae Pectora Palmis.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Priam</HI> rai&s;ing his unnerved Arms, and imploring the Body of his Son <HI>Hector</HI> from <HI>Achilles,</HI> who dragged the Corps thrice round the Walls of <HI>Troy,</HI> mu&s;t al&s;o afford great Room for the Expre&s;&s;ion of &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ions all at once &s;truggling in the Soul; and upon the whole, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, that if &s;uch a Painting as this Great Poet has here de&s;cribed were handed down to us, it would be the mo&s;t valuable Piece of all Antiquity.</P>

<P>_PROMPTED by the E&s;teem I have for your entertaining and in&s;tructive Writings, I venture to convey my Sentiments to you in Relation to &s;ome Mi&s;carriages in Life, which proceed rather from Ignorance and the want of Education, than any natural Propen&s;ity to Evil; and I am the more induced to this, as my own Life will afford ample Room for Reflection.</P>
<P>Without any further Detail, you mu&s;t know then, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> that I am the Son of a Trade&s;man in the We&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> long &s;ince decea&s;ed; the Lowne&s;s of my Father's Circum&s;tances would but barely &s;uffice for the Maintenance of a numerous Family, and you will therefore &s;ugge&s;t to your&s;elf, that my Education could not be better than what is afforded in the Generality of Country-Village Schools. In vain did my Father &s;ol|licit the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a rich Relation of his at <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> in vain did he repre&s;ent the promi&s;ing Genius of his Son, if put under proper Culture. Deaf to the Ties of Af|finity, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an E&s;tate of fifteen hundred <HI>per Annum,</HI> and a large per&s;onal Fortune, without the Charge of a Family, and any Likelihood of having
<PB N="138" REF="149">any, he would afford him no A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and I was therefore obliged, after having gleaned up all I could in the &s;hort Time I was at School, to &s;eek a Service with a neighbouring Farmer. With him I lived &s;everal Years driving Plough, and employed in other Sort of Hu&s;bandry, when News arrived of the Death of the Relation I mentioned, and of his having left me all his real E&s;tate, with &s;ix Thou&s;and Pounds in Money, and three Thou&s;and Pounds to each of my four Si&s;ters. When I tell you that from my Education, and the Nature of my Servitude, I contracted a very &s;trong Bya&s;s to low Company, you will imagine, I mu&s;t make but a very indifferent Figure in my new Station. I was then two and twenty, and had never been accu&s;tomed to any Kind of Intemperance; and if my former Situation had enabled me to have been reckoned Company for the Gentlemen of the Place, I might &s;till have continued a &s;ober Man; but unhappily for me, the Circum&s;tance of my having been a Servant, made me, notwith&s;tand|ing the Largene&s;s of my Fortune, &s;hunned and de&s;pi&s;ed, and I was con&s;trained to herd with my former Com|panions, and others of better Sub&s;tance, but abandoned Morals, with whom I &s;oon acquired an Habit of Idle|ne&s;s and Debauchery, by which, in a few Years, I found my ready Money exhau&s;ted. To gratify the Extrava|gance of my Pa&s;&s;ions, which were now become violent and unruly, I was advi&s;ed to take up &s;ome Money upon Part of my E&s;tate, and to this Purpo&s;e I applied to a neighbouring Lawyer, who &s;oon procured it for me. As the Meanne&s;s of my Education had hindered me from knowing any Thing of Law Affairs, I got my two Companions to overlook the Mortgage Deed, and with their Advice &s;igned it, and they al&s;o &s;et their Hands as Witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="150">Being now in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;even Thou&s;and Pounds, I was advi&s;ed by the&s;e my two Friends to &s;ee the World, as they called it, and accordingly I &s;et out &s;oon after with them for <HI>London,</HI> leaving the afore&s;aid Lawyer to receive all my Rents in the Country. You will na|turally imagine, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> that in Town I ta&s;ted all the Plea&s;ures it could give me; I &s;aw every Thing, but &s;till in the wor&s;t Company, and was con|tinually &s;urrounded by a Set of Sharpers, till having &s;quandered away all my Money, and got con&s;iderably in Debt, I was arre&s;ted and &s;ent to the <HI>Fleet.</HI> In this Situation I directed my Lawyer to remit me &s;ome Money, and the Arre&s;t gave me no Concern, as I made no Doubt of being quickly at Liberty; but judge, Sir, my Surprize, when I was informed, that the Lawyer was in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my whole E&s;tate, by an ab&s;olute Surrender from me, which I had through Ignorance &s;igned in&s;tead of a Mortgage deed, and that my two Friends, who had left me ju&s;t before I was arre&s;ted, ap|peared for the Attorney to witne&s;s the whole Tran&s;|action. The Bitterne&s;s of this Calamity, and the Con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a mi&s;pent Life, filled me with the &s;evere&s;t Grief, and would have entirely extingui&s;hed the U&s;e of what little Rea&s;on I had, but for the Charity of a Fellow-Pri&s;oner, who, touched with a Sen&s;e of my Mis|fortunes, not only did every Thing to alleviate them, but infu&s;ed &s;uch a Portion of Knowledge and Philo&s;ophy into my Mind, during our long Impri&s;onment, as mu&s;t for ever render me &s;en&s;ible of his Kindne&s;s. Let me fini&s;h the Account of my Life, when I have told you, that I was freed from my Impri&s;onment by the la&s;t Act of Grace, and that, with a moderate Su&s;tenance, pro|cured by hone&s;t Indu&s;try, I find my&s;elf more happy and contented now, than when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Affluence, and a Mind immer&s;ed in Ignorance and Folly.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="151">As my Si&s;ters received no better Education than my|&s;elf, I &s;hould tell you, that notwith&s;tanding their For|tune, they are all come to Infamy and Poverty. The Elde&s;t, &s;oon after our Relation's Death, married a La|bourer to the Farmer &s;he had lived with in the Station of Maid Servant, and they have run through all they had. The &s;econd was debauched by the Son of the Gentleman, at who&s;e Hou&s;e &s;he had hired her&s;elf, and is now in one of the Hou&s;es of bad Fame in <HI>Covent-Garden;</HI> the third married a Footman, and died about two Years ago, after having lived in great Di&s;tre&s;s; and the fourth, with Shame I &s;peak it, is now Mi&s;tre&s;s to the Earl of******.</P>
<P>From this Account of my&s;elf and my Family, I &s;hall only draw one Inference, that if the Relation, who left us &s;o liberally at his Death, had but given us a good Education, and behaved to us in his Life-time agreeably to the E&s;tate he intended to leave us, the Misfortune we have met with, might, in all human Probability, have been avoided; and being connected by Marriage, or otherways, with Families of Credit and Reputation, we might now remain in Affluence, and enjoy a Name un&s;ullied by Vice and Infamy.

<PB N="141" REF="152">under Affliction, and that can look back to former Scenes of Life with &s;o much Sen&s;ibility, would have imbibed &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions from an early Improvement, as might have rendered him an Ornament to any Family. If many of tho&s;e, who find any &s;triking Incidents in the Series of their Lives, would thus communicate them to the Public, it would be a very great Service to Society, as it would &s;erve to detect the Ways of the World, and might put the Unwary upon their Guard again&s;t ill-de&s;igning Men. There is &s;omething extremely affecting in the Ruin of my Corre&s;pondent's four Si&s;ters, but I am, however, highly plea&s;ed that he now enjoys a Tranquillity of Mind, and that, to alleviate Calamity, his Re&s;ources are in Virtue and hone&s;t Indu&s;try. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the Inattention of the old Gentleman, who died at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> to the Manners and Morals of his Relations, &s;hewed &s;omething in him highly illiberal, not to give it a wor&s;e Epithet; and it is owing to this Indifference to the Improvement of the ri&s;ing Genera|tion, that we frequently &s;ee E&s;tates in the Hands of tho&s;e who are a Di&s;grace to Riches; and while this con|tinues to be the Ca&s;e, it is not to be wondered, that we meet with &s;o many Boobies of Fa&s;hion, inelegant in their Behaviour, loo&s;e in their Morals, and fit to ride behind the Equipage, in which their Pride now lolls at Ea&s;e.</P>

<P>LAST Night the Votaries of Folly a&s;&s;embled here, for the fourth Time this Sea&s;on, the Curtain was drawn exactly at Ten, and, in about &s;ix Minutes, the Side-boards were entirely &s;tripped of the Sweetmeats

<P>_THE Laurel, which has been &s;o much &s;ought by the Writers of every Age, is not unlike the Golden Branch mentioned in the &s;ixth <HI>Aeneid;</HI> if a Man is born to &s;hare the Prize, it is ea&s;ily obtained; but if there be not derived from Heaven a Superiority of Genius, fruitle&s;s is the Endeavour of the unborn Poet, who thinks to arrive at the Heights of Fame by painful Vigils and the Dint of Labour and Application. A Medio|crity in Poetry will never be allowed: <HI>Horace</HI> tells us that the Suffrages of both Gods and Men are again&s;t it, and that a Writer of this Ca&s;t mu&s;t never expect to &s;ee his Name on the Book&s;eller's Rubrick-Po&s;t. Poetry requires warm and glowing Colours; the Language of it mu&s;t be elevated above the Diction of Pro&s;e; the Expre&s;&s;ions &s;hould be more animated, and the Imagi|nation of the Reader more immediately &s;truck at, than in any other kind of Writing; and whoever has not
<PB N="144" REF="155">Energy of Genius to cultivate the&s;e Qualities, will be always &s;ure to be neglected as a cold and &s;piritle&s;s Author.</P>
<P>Of all the different Species of Poetry, the Dramatic is the mo&s;t difficult to &s;ucceed in, and, as it is expre&s;&s;ed in the Words of my Motto, tho&s;e few only, whom Heaven has peculiarly favoured with an Elevation of Mind, have been able to acquit them&s;elves with Ho|nour. Our much admired <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;tands yet un|rivalled; he &s;eized the Laurel with a Ma&s;ter-Hand at one Gra&s;p; <HI>John&s;on,</HI> by &s;lower Degrees, though eager in Pur&s;uit; <HI>avidu&s;que refringit cunctantem;</HI> and <HI>Otway</HI> &s;eems to have gained it with Facility.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed to find, that an Author ju&s;tly celebrated among the foremo&s;t Succe&s;&s;ors of the&s;e immortal Ge|nius's, has added another Wreath to that Garland, which the Mu&s;es long &s;ince wove for him; and, in my Opi|nion, the Public is greatly indebted to him for his <HI>new Tragedy</HI> of the <HI>Brothers,</HI> which was lately acted for the fir&s;t Time at <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI> At the &s;ame Time that I advance this, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the Subject of it is not perhaps as intere&s;ting to a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Audience, as a more dome&s;tick Story; and the Generality of People not being acquainted with the Hi&s;tory of that Monarchy, it thence re&s;ults that the Di&s;tre&s;s of the King of <HI>Macedon</HI> does not engage our Pa&s;&s;ions &s;o forcibly as might be ex|pected. It may be added, that the <HI>Macedonians</HI> are &s;up|po&s;ed, at that Point of Time, to be at Variance with the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, for which we have contracted a kind of reverential E&s;teem; and on this Account tho&s;e &s;ublime Sentiments, which <HI>Philip</HI> utters in the Scene with the Amba&s;&s;adors, again&s;t that Republick, are not received with a &s;ufficient Degree of Warmth. But if it be con&s;i|dered, that the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Monarchy, though it dwindled by in&s;en&s;ible Degrees, and was at la&s;t &s;wallowed up
<PB N="145" REF="156">by the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, was at one Time the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing in <HI>Europe,</HI> I apprehend no Man can be entirely unconcerned in the Fall of &s;o brave a People. I do not doubt but the Mention of <HI>Cre&s;&s;i</HI> and <HI>Poitiers</HI> would have a more powerful Influence on the Pa&s;&s;ions of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> than <HI>Thra&s;ymene</HI> and <HI>Cannae;</HI> but for my Part, my Brea&s;t glowed to hear of tho&s;e memorable Bat|tles, which had like to have been &s;o fatal to the <HI>Roman</HI> Republick; nor do I remember a grander Sentiment than that of <HI>Philip,</HI> when the Flight of <HI>Hannibal</HI> at <HI>Capua</HI> is urged by the Emba&s;&s;y of <HI>Rome.</HI> His An&s;wer is, <HI>Ay, there indeed I was not with him.</HI> The Scene which &s;uc|ceeds this, is full of as tender Emotions as I have ever felt in any Theatre; the Angui&s;h of the Father, to find a Di&s;cord &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between his Children, and the Re|mon&s;trance with which he endeavours to &s;ooth them, mu&s;t &s;often the Mind of every Hearer.</P>
<Q><L>Why do I &s;igh? Do ye not know, my Sons?</L>
<L>And if you do, Oh! let me &s;igh no more!</L>
<L>Let the&s;e white Hairs put in a Claim to Peace.</L></Q>
<P>Perhaps no Characters can be better marked than tho&s;e of <HI>Philip, Per&s;eus,</HI> and <HI>Demetrius;</HI> for the two la&s;t of which we are finely prepared by the following Lines.*</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; They both are bright; but one</L>
<L>Benignly bright, as Stars to Mariners;</L>
<L>And one a Comet with malignant Blaze</L>
<L>Denouncing Ruin.</L></Q>
<P>The Art of mo&s;t Writers for the Stage is to exhibit one Character, and that perhaps without any di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Qualities to &s;eparate it from other Heroes; but in this Play we are entertained with three of a different
<PB N="146" REF="157">Ca&s;t, and each &s;trongly marked. <HI>Philip</HI> is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a Warmth of Temper, an Haughtine&s;s of Soul, and a Tenderne&s;s for his Children, that runs over in the mo&s;t affecting Manner. <HI>Per&s;eus</HI> is a different Villain from any we have &s;een on the Stage; Policy and Bra|very are &s;o blended in him, that we &s;ee their mixed Ef|fects in every Scene; and <HI>Demetrius</HI> is of &s;o amiable a Di&s;po&s;ition, that an Audience mu&s;t be naturally in|clined to love him, and for his Sake to dread the re&s;tle&s;s turbulent Spirit of <HI>Per&s;eus,</HI> who&s;e Contempt of <HI>De|metrius</HI> vents it&s;elf in a &s;neering artful Strain.</P>
<Q><L>You that admire the <HI>Romans,</HI> break the Bridge</L>
<L>With <HI>Cocles,</HI> or with <HI>Curtius</HI> leap the Gulph:</L>
<L>And league not with the Vices of our Foes.</L>
<L>I hear, Sir, you take Wing and mount in Metre;</L>
<L><HI>Terence</HI> has own'd your Aid; <HI>Terence</HI> there the Slave</L></Q>
<P>The Invocation, which is uttered by the &s;ame Per|&s;onage, is carried on in a ma&s;terly Manner, filling the Mind with a Train of awful Ideas, and ri&s;ing in a Climax of Horror to the la&s;t Line.</P>
<Q><L>Hear, from thy Ebon Throne, profounde&s;t Night,</L>
<L>Thou and thy gloomy Daughters all, that &s;mile</L>
<L>On Deeds of Horror, and on Frauds of Hell;</L>
<L>That keep the Door of black Con&s;piracy,</L>
<L>And &s;nuff the grateful Scent of human Blood;</L>
<L>From <HI>Acheron</HI>'s &s;ulphureous Banks ari&s;e,</L>
<L>And bur&s;ting through the Barriers of this World,</L>
<L>Stand in dread Contra&s;t to the Golden Sun,</L>
<L>And &s;pread around your pe&s;tilential Bla&s;ts,</L>
<L>That wither every Virtue in the Bud;</L>
<L>While I tran&s;port ye, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<P><PB N="147" REF="158">
It will be unnece&s;&s;ary to remind my Readers of the Trial-Scene, which mu&s;t inevitably fire the intelligent Mind with a cla&s;&s;ic Warmth. I cannot help thinking that the Author, in this Pa&s;&s;age, has given a ju&s;t Idea of the two different Kinds of Eloquence, which pre|vailed in <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Per&s;eus</HI> enters immediately into the Matter; his Sentences are &s;trong and nervous; and, &s;ure of con|vincing the Under&s;tanding by the Clearne&s;s of his Diction, he does not conde&s;cend to addre&s;s the Imagi|nation. It is true, he at one Time &s;heds Tears, but that is only to obviate the Power of Eloquence, which he is aware might be u&s;ed by his Brother, who ha|ving imbibed the Art of <HI>Roman</HI> Oratory, &s;ets out in the mo&s;t in&s;inuating Manner; tries the Avenues to the Pa&s;&s;ions, and endeavours to win his Hearers by Per&s;ua&s;ion. I am &s;en&s;ible that this Beauty may e&s;cape the Multitude, but, even without this &s;econdary Plea|&s;ure, the Scene cannot &s;ail of &s;triking every Imagi|nation.</P>
<P>The Di&s;tre&s;s of <HI>Demetrius</HI> in the fourth and fifth Act bears hard upon our Affections, and it mu&s;t be a Torture to every compa&s;&s;ionate Heart, to &s;ee him undone by the Artifices of Villainy. His Speech, when di&s;covered in Gaol, has many affecting Strokes.

<P>I cannot conclude this Paper without taking Notice of the Propen&s;ity, which the &s;mall Critics di&s;covered at the Repre&s;entation of this Piece, to attach them&s;elves to every trivial Circum&s;tance, which could have the lea&s;t Tendency to excite their Mirth; and I mu&s;t inform them that to be un&s;u&s;ceptible of manly Emotions, and at the &s;ame Time to yield to the idle Sen&s;ations of Levity and giddy Merriment, is the Sign of a little and frivolous Mind.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The gloomy Month of <HI>November</HI> being pa&s;&s;ed, I ima|gined that the horrid Crime of Suicide would cea&s;e, at lea&s;t till the Return of that heavy Time of the Year. It is certainly a poor De&s;ertion from the Dignity of our Nature, to &s;uffer the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Atmo&s;phere, or any other &s;ublunary Incident, to make &s;uch an Impre&s;|&s;ion upon our Spirits, as to render us avowed Enemies to our&s;elves. I have heard a popular In&s;urrection called, an unnatural Rebellion; but by what Name &s;hall we &s;tigmatize an Action, which flies in the Face of our Maker, which dares to thwart the Di&s;pen&s;ations of the &s;upreme Being, and &s;ay to eternal Providence, who from the fir&s;t ordained all Things for the be&s;t,
<Q>"NOT THINE, BUT MY WILL BE DONE?"</Q></P>
<P>It requires no Profu&s;ion of Imagery, no bold daring Metaphor, no &s;tudied Hyperbole to repre&s;ent this Piece of Impiety in its proper Colours; it &s;trikes the Eye at once in its mo&s;t flagrant atrocious Dye, and were it &s;ufficiently attended to, it would teach a due Re&s;igna|tion to the Determinations of Heaven, and would pre|vent all that Train of Evils, from which any thinking Mind mu&s;t now &s;tart back appalled.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="163">If Self-Pre&s;ervation is the neare&s;t Principle to the Heart of Man, what a Perver&s;ion of our Faculties, of our Rea&s;on, and our Judgment, mu&s;t u&s;urp the Mind of him, who thus runs counter to the very End of his Creation! The Dignity of the human Soul is extin|gui&s;hed; not only his Power of Reflexion is &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, but his very Pa&s;&s;ions are thrown off their Bya&s;s; they are &s;educed from their original In&s;titution; their Nature, U&s;e, and End is perverted; and what before &s;ought real or apparent Plea&s;ure, and avoided actual or ima|ginary Pain, now by a &s;trange Fatality &s;eeks its own De&s;truction. Anarchy and Civil War di&s;turb the Ima|gination, and the Man bears his own &s;ecret Enemy in his Brea&s;t; he forms a De&s;ign upon his own Life; he has the Air drawn Dagger con&s;tantly before his Eyes, and he at length becomes his <HI>own Macheth.</HI> Not even the bloody Purpo&s;er of determined Vengeance on ano|ther's Head (horrid as the Crime appears) is half &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing; becau&s;e he does not carry with him half the Ab&s;urdity. The latter has Time left him to atone by Penitence for his Barbarity, whereas the Suicide urges precipitantly to the Tribunal of his offended God.</P>
<P>The real Source of this fatal Evil is perhaps hard to be a&s;certained; but if it is not originally an Emana|tion from Pride, it is tinged with it &s;o &s;trongly, that there is Rea&s;on to conclude, it is frequently derived from thence. Self Love will always induce us to over|rate our Rank in the Scale of Beings, and when once the Imagination is &s;truck with the Idea of fancied Im|portance, each little Trial of Adver&s;ity is con&s;idered as a Grievance intolerable; it is too much for the Man to bear; he concludes him&s;elf a de&s;tined Mark for Af|fliction, and, rather than drag a feveri&s;h Life under an
<PB N="153" REF="164">huge Load of Mi&s;ery, he proudly re&s;olves to put an End to his Sufferings, and mea&s;ure out the Thread of his own Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>For my own Part, I cannot look upon any Con|tingence in this World of Con&s;equence &s;ufficient to urge a Man to this Extreme of Madne&s;s. Is he reduced to Want by his inordinate Expences, or do the Narrow|ne&s;s of Circum&s;tances prevent him from emerging into that Station of Life, which his Ambition would a&s;pire to?&mdash;Let him but examine the Happine&s;s of the Affluent; how many want with a full Pur&s;e, how many are tortured with Di&s;ea&s;es, or eaten up with unea&s;y Pa&s;|&s;ions? Have a Man's Relations unworthily withdrawn their Protection from him? there are Occupations enough, in which he may endeavour to &s;upport him|&s;elf, without their A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and then he will have the Satisfaction of living independent of tho&s;e who have de&s;erted him; and &s;hould he fail, his hone&s;t Indi|gence will at all Times be a Di&s;grace to them; &s;o that either Way he will be a living Affront to his fal&s;e Friends.</P>
<P>In &s;o polite an Age it may not be proper to corro|borate what has been advanced, by Arguments drawn from Religion; but if an Heathen may have any Weight in the Affair, I would inform the Man of De|&s;pair, that <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Cicero</HI> were both of Opinion, that we are placed in this World, as Soldiers upon Duty, and that no one has a Right to move without the Sum|mons of his commanding Officer; and <HI>Virgil</HI> in the Words of my Motto tells us, that there is a Place of Retribution for tho&s;e unhappy Wretches, who dare to lay violent Hands upon them&s;elves, and, prodigal of Life, to precipitate their Souls into Eternity. They would be glad, continues the Poet, to bear Poverty and the &s;harpe&s;t Mi&s;eries, could they again return to
<PB N="154" REF="165">Life; but the Fates forbid them, and their Pa&s;&s;age is irremeable.</P>
<P>To the&s;e Authorities, I would beg Leave to add the Sentiment of our great <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> who, though he may be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected of Chri&s;tianity, was &s;till a Poet, and therefore may be cited on this Occa&s;ion. He has introduced a young Prince, deliberating, whether he &s;hould not extricate him&s;elf from the Troubles of this World, by boldly putting an End to his Re&s;idence on this Side of the Grave. The Point is argued with great Strength of Rea&s;oning; the Calamities of this Life are thrown into the Scale, and after &s;tating every Thing in the mo&s;t &s;triking Colours, a Pro&s;pect of Futurity opens to the Imagination, and the Mind &s;tarts back from the de&s;perate Act, convinced that it is our Duty to en|dure Life, and bear our Portion with Fortitude, until Heaven &s;hall be plea&s;ed to put in Execution that Sen|tence of Death, which it has pa&s;&s;ed on all Mankind.</P>
<Q><L>Who wou'd Fardels bear,</L>
<L>To &s;weat and groan under a weary Life,</L>
<L>But that the Dread of &s;omething after Death,</L>
<L>That undi&s;cover'd Country, from who&s;e Bourne</L>
<L>No Traveller returns, puzzles the Will,</L>
<L>And makes us rather bear tho&s;e Ills we have,</L>

<P>FROM a Motive of Gratitude, and for the Benefit of my Countrymen in general, I beg Leave, thro' the Channel of your Paper, to communicate the Di&s;or|der I have been for &s;ome Time afflicted with, and the
<PB N="155" REF="166">traordinary Cure I lately met with. I have had for many Months &s;ucce&s;&s;ively a flow nervous Fever, with a con&s;tant Flutter on my Spirits, attended with pertina|cious Watchings, Twitchings of the Nerves, and other grievous Symptoms, which reduced me to a mere Sha|dow. At length a Friend, who had him&s;elf expe|rienced it, advi&s;ed me to have Recour&s;e to the reading of the <HI>In&s;pector</HI>'s Papers. I accordingly took one of them over Night, and the Con&s;equence was, I fell into a profound Sleep, which la&s;ted near &s;ix and thirty Hours. Since that I have been ordered, for fear of a Lethargy, to take them in &s;maller Quantities. A Paragraph at a Time now an&s;wers my Purpo&s;e, and, under Heaven, I owe my &s;leeping Faculties to the above-mentioned <HI>In|&s;pector.</HI> I look upon them to be a grand <HI>Soporificum mirabile,</HI> proper to be had in all Families. He makes great Allowance to tho&s;e who buy 'em to &s;ell again, or &s;end abroad to the Plantations. The above Fact I am ready to atte&s;t, when called upon.</P>

<P>_I WENT, one Morning la&s;t Week to pay a Vi&s;it to a Lady, for whom I have always had a very great Re&s;pect. An Excur&s;ion which &s;he made, into the Country, was the Occa&s;ion of my not having &s;een her for &s;ome Time, but upon the fir&s;t Notice of her being in Town, I imme|diately did my&s;elf the Favour of waiting on her. It was with great Satisfaction, that I perceived her Com|plexion florid to the highe&s;t Degree of Health. As I knew &s;he had two Sons at <HI>Eton</HI> School, I enquired after the young Gentlemen, and received for An&s;wer, that the Brats were minding their Books. <Q>Boys, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) are be&s;t when out of one's Way &mdash; they make &s;uch a Noi&s;e in an Hou&s;e, that there is really no &s;uch Thing as bearing with them &mdash; I hope they are going on well &mdash; But, Sir, you don't know all my Family.</Q> Upon this &s;he rung the Bell, and ordered the Servant to bring down Mi&s;s <HI>Lucy</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and then continued Mrs. <HI>Bizarre,</HI> <Q>they are both quite jealous of one another; Mi&s;s <HI>Lucy</HI> has taken a Notion into her Head that <HI>Charlotte</HI> is my Favourite, and <HI>Charlotte</HI> equally &s;u&s;pects my Pro|pen&s;ity to <HI>Lucy,</HI> &mdash; but upon my Word, it is without Foundation; I give them no Manner of Rea&s;on, &mdash; well, now I think it would be quite wrong in me to make any Difference, when they are both de&s;erving;&mdash; I vow and prote&s;t, I love them both alike &mdash; I can't think how &s;ome Folks can be &s;o&mdash;to be &s;ure it's
<PB N="157" REF="168">very commonly the Cau&s;e of great Unea&s;ine&s;s in a Family, and the little Things are unhappy in their Minds &mdash; Lard, I wonder what keeps them above &s;o long</Q> &mdash; When on a &s;udden the Parlour Door was thrown open, and as I did not recollect that Mrs. <HI>Bizarre</HI> had any Daughters, I advanced with &s;ome Degree of Impatience to &s;alute the young Ladies; but to my great Surprize, the Maid introduced to me two very ugly Monkeys, dre&s;&s;ed out in the nice&s;t Manner with <HI>Paris</HI> Caps, and well cho&s;en Petonlair and Petti|coat.</P>
<P>The Di&s;appointment I met with flung me into &s;ome Confu&s;ion, and I retired back in a very aukward Man|ner to my Chair. <Q>There, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> (rea&s;&s;umed the Lady) this is Mi&s;s <HI>Lucy</HI> and this is Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte</HI> &mdash; Pray, Sir, don't you think they have very pretty turned Faces &mdash; there's a Family Likene&s;s between them, I think &mdash; they are the only Comfort I have &mdash; Pray, <HI>Molly,</HI> did Mi&s;s <HI>Lucy,</HI> take the Manna as the Doctor ordered, &mdash; Lord, I was frighted out of my Wits Ye&s;terday, the poor thing was &s;o terribly pained with the Cholic &mdash; and Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte</HI> has been coughing all the Morning; I hope it won't fall upon her Lungs; &mdash; they are the &s;weete&s;t Creatures in the World &mdash; Where's your Curt&s;ey, Mi&s;s, when a Gentleman &s;peaks to you? &mdash; She is ab&s;olutely, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> the greate&s;t Prude in <HI>London</HI> &mdash; She quarrels with the Maid, if &s;he but leaves her Brea&s;t the lea&s;t uncovered; and you know, the Fa&s;hion is now to &s;hew as low as one po&s;&s;ibly can&mdash; and her Si&s;ter there, Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte,</HI> &s;he is the violente&s;t Coquet in Nature &mdash; <HI>Molly,</HI> give that Fan &mdash; See how &s;he handles it &mdash; Soft Affectation plays about her twi&s;ted Neck, as it's in the Play &mdash; don't you think &s;he has fine Eyes? &mdash; Well, did you ever &s;ee &s;uch a pretty little Mouth;
<PB N="158" REF="169">and the fine&s;t Teeth &mdash; I am afraid &s;he is a little in|clined to be &s;at &mdash; She'll never be taller &mdash; Lard, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> I wi&s;h I could get her a Hu&s;band; I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee her well &s;ettled &mdash; he, he, he.&mdash; Now, I have a queer Notion in my Head &mdash; Do you know that I have a Hu&s;band in my Eye for her? &mdash; Gue&s;s who it is</Q> &mdash; To this I took Occa&s;ion to an&s;wer, that there are really &s;o many pretty Gentlemen about Town, that it would be ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for me to form a right Conjecture, and I therefore begged &s;he would be &s;o kind as to inform me. <Q>Why, Sir, (re|plied &s;he) there is <HI>Tom Titmou&s;e,</HI> that is always biting his Lips, and never has a Bit of his Shoe &s;een above his Buckle; and <HI>Billy Wirewig,</HI> who always &s;tinks of Perfume; or <HI>Jemmy Doll,</HI> with the delicate Com|plexion, and the little mincing Step; but it is not any of them &mdash; O fie, the Frights! &mdash; do you think I would accept of any of 'em &mdash; I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, I refu&s;ed a much better Offer &mdash; I could have had Captain <HI>Je&s;&s;amy</HI> of the Guards, but I have a finer Thought in my Head now &mdash; Was you ever at <HI>Mo|ther Midnight</HI>'s? &mdash; To be &s;ure you was, he, he, he, &mdash; Well, for certain, I am a comical Woman &mdash; You remember the pretty dear Creature, that &s;its at Supper on the right Hand &mdash; he, he, he, it came into my Mind the Moment I &s;aw the dear Fellow, that it would be a good Match; and &s;o now, as I don't know where to &s;end, I have drawn up an Adverti&s;ement which I intend to put into the Papers &mdash; here, you may read it, Sir.</Q></P>
<P>This I complied with; it was in Sub&s;tance as follows:</P>
<P><Q>If the Monkey, that &s;at on the right Hand at <HI>Mother Midnight</HI>'s, and drank a Gla&s;s of Wine, after bowing to the Company, has no Aver&s;ion to Matri|mony;
<PB N="159" REF="170">he is de&s;ired to call at <HI>May-Fair</HI> Chapel, and he will hear of &s;omething to his Advantage.</Q></P>
<P>Upon Peru&s;al of this extraordinary Adverti&s;ement, I endeavoured to expo&s;tulate with the good Lady, on the Oddity of her Proceeding, and I remon&s;trated, that it would appear to the World the mo&s;t whim&s;ical Thing that was ever practi&s;ed. Irritated at this, Mrs. <HI>Bizarre</HI> could not bear to be touched in &s;o tender a Point, and &s;he told me with &s;ome Vehemence, that Monkeys have often more Sen&s;e than many of the human Species; and I believe the Di&s;pute would have ro&s;e high between us, had not an Accident put an End to it.</P>
<P>While we were engaged in Conver&s;ation, a Quarrel happened between the two young Ladies, and in a Mo|ment Mi&s;s <HI>Lucy</HI> tore off Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte</HI>'s Cap; which Compliment was returned in Kind, and then the Bat|tle was carried on with great Eargerne&s;s on both Sides, attended with violent Screamings, with bouncing about the Room, leaping on Chairs and Tables, and flying violently in our Faces. All the Ornaments on the Mantle-piece were broke to Shatters; the China Figures, which before &s;eem'd to breathe and think, came trem|bling down. <HI>Woodward</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Clive,</HI> who repre&s;ented in exqui&s;ite <HI>Chel&s;ea-Ware,</HI> their different Characters in <HI>Lethe,</HI> &s;hared the general Wreck; Mrs. <HI>Bizarre</HI>'s Face was &s;cratched in &s;everal Places, and &s;he al&s;o lo&s;t in the Fray a very elegant Pair of <HI>Dre&s;den</HI> Ru&s;tles.</P>
<P>Prudence directed me to e&s;cape from this &s;trange Scene with the utmo&s;t Expedition, and as &s;oon as I found my&s;elf in my Chambers, I could not help reflect|ing on the whim&s;ical Turn of Mind, which di&s;po&s;ed this Lady to fix her Heart on &s;uch a di&s;agreeable Race of Animals. When a Woman becomes an Apo&s;tate from the Laws of Nature, and dive&s;ts her&s;elf of the pro|per
<PB N="160" REF="171">Ornaments of her Sex, &s;he is as great an Exotick as any in her Collection of wild Bea&s;ts. I believe, the Pangs of Jealou&s;y would be much keener in an Hu&s;band's Brea&s;t, were he to find him&s;elf rivalled by a Monkey; and for &s;uch a Set of odious Creatures to &s;ee a Per&s;on neglect her own Children, is &s;o fanta&s;tical a Circum&s;tance, that &s;ome of my Readers may perhaps think the Exi&s;tence of &s;uch a Character improbable; but I can a&s;&s;ure them, that there are frequent In&s;tances of it in this Town.</P>
<P>To regulate and govern the Imagination, is recom|mended by a <HI>Greek</HI> Philo&s;opher, as a Point of Moment in the Conduct of Life; and mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly the Rule is excellent. The Imagination is the livelie&s;t Faculty of the Soul, and gives to all Objects the Hue and Colour, which they &s;eemingly wear; and we love and hate, hope and fear, according to the Scenes which are pictured to our Fancy. It is this which makes <HI>Quixotilla</HI> call aloud for a Cork; and under a due Government is the Source of that &s;prightly Ta&s;te and ju&s;t Sen&s;e of Things, which is remarkable in <HI>An|gelica;</HI> it is this which gives new Graces to her Beauty, irradiates her whole Countenance, and in all Scenes and Circum&s;tances of Life renders her the mo&s;t amia|ble of her Sex.</P>
<P>To cultivate, therefore, and cheri&s;h the natural Af|fections, to direct them to worthy Objects, to keep them all in Harmony, &s;o that not one of them &s;hall grow out of due Proportion, or contract any whim&s;ical Habit, is the be&s;t Pre&s;erver and Beautifier of the female Form, it gives that plea&s;ing Turn of Mind which we call Sweet|ne&s;s of Temper, prevents Wrinkles, Di&s;tortion of the Features, and gives an agreeable Air to the whole Per&s;on, as a few of the Sex have experienced; and as &s;uch it is this Day recommended to all the female Readers of this Paper.</P>

<P>_CONSIDERING the State of Warfare, an Au|thor enters into, when fir&s;t he takes a Pen in Hand, and the Number of <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> that infe&s;t every Age, ready to in&s;ult defencele&s;s Wit, to pull it by the No&s;e, or oblige it to endure the Di&s;cipline of the Toe; I have been punctually three Times a Week at a celebrated Fencing School, in order to perfect my&s;elf in the noble Science of Defence. The Ma&s;ter of this Place un|der&s;tands the Method of killing as well as any Gentle|man of the Faculty, but his Temper of Mind renders him le&s;s inclinable to put it in Practice; he allows me to be a very good Figure on the Ground; &s;ays, I &s;tand an excellent Attitude, and adds, that, when I bring my&s;elf to do Things not &s;o much in an Hurry, I &s;hall &s;ence as well as any angry Boy in <HI>England.</HI> I mu&s;t own, that I am apt to advance and retreat in too precipitate a Manner, and this Exerci&s;e throws my Spirits into &s;uch a Flurry, that I &s;ometimes cannot avoid doing Mi&s;chief. I have already put out a Gentleman's Eye, di&s;located three of another's Teeth, and broke my Foil upon the &s;mall Ribs of a Third; and, if I proceed in this Manner, I begin to be apprehen&s;ive about the Con&s;equences which may ari&s;e from unfore&s;een Acci|dents, and therefore I am now determined to entrench my&s;elf from In&s;ults within one of the Re&s;olutions, which
<PB N="164" REF="175">I entered into upon the Commencement of this Paper, <HI>viz.</HI> not to de&s;erve Ill of any Man.</P>
<P>It would be well if all the Individuals of Society would enter into a reciprocal Agreement of ob&s;erving the &s;ame Principle in their Deportment we might then &s;ee that Harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;t, which as &s;ociable Beings it is our Bu|&s;ine&s;s to promote; this would bani&s;h all &s;urly Moro&s;e|ne&s;s; and in &s;hort, this &s;ingle Rule, of de&s;erving I'l from no Man, would prevent all Indecorums and Ani|mo&s;ities, and &s;ub&s;titute in their Room mutual Con&s;i|dence and Good-breeding.</P>
<P>But the contrary occurs every Day, and &s;eems to be derived from no other Source than a vicious Gratifi|cation of our private Humours. A &s;elfi&s;h Spirit is condemned in Ethics as the Cau&s;e of many Vices, and it is of no le&s;s evil Influence in the <HI>Petites Morales,</HI> or <HI>le&s;&s;er Morals.</HI> When a narrow Regard to a Man's own Sen&s;ations gains the A&s;cendant, and none will recede from their equal Right of having their own Way, it is not to be wondered, that ill Humours &s;hould &s;our the Temper, and that frequent Quarrels &s;hould ari&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Philip&s;us</HI> has taken it into his Head, that to be bri&s;k and &s;hining in Conver&s;ation is the mo&s;t elegant Accom|pli&s;hment he can a&s;pire to, and therefore has &s;pent mo&s;t of his Time in the Acquirement of &s;omething, that he calls Wit; but in the Eyes of Men of Sen&s;e, is only a petulant Pertne&s;s very annoying to his Com|pany. <HI>Philip&s;us</HI> has laid it down as a Maxim, that he mu&s;t upon all Occa&s;ions di&s;play his favourite Talent, and would rather at any Time lo&s;e his Friend than his Joke. <HI>Antiphaus</HI> is an ab&s;olute Enemy to all Preten|&s;ions to be &s;hining; Conver&s;ation with him, mu&s;t be in a plain &s;en&s;ible Manner; he will neither give nor take a Joke; hence the&s;e two are con&s;tantly at Vari|ance,
<PB N="165" REF="176">and it is imagined by their Friends, that the Affair mu&s;t be at la&s;t decided behind <HI>Montague-Hou&s;e</HI></P>
<P>For my Part, I have often wondered how Men can be &s;uch Enemies to their Plea&s;ures, as to be thus ob&s;ti|nately bent on the Indulgence of their own private Whim|&s;ies, without abating any Thing from their Preten&s;ions, in order to contribute to the Felicity of their Neighbours. The &s;ocial Pa&s;&s;ions afford more real Delight, than any &s;elfi&s;h Gratifications; the latter are &s;ure to Occa&s;ion a Nar|rowne&s;s of Spirit, while the former expand the Faculties of the Mind, and receive Addition from being com|municated, like the Sun painting the Hemi&s;phere with Streaks of Light, which &s;erve to adorn his Way, and augment the Glory of his Career. In a State of mu|tual Dependance, which Nature has allotted to us all, it is not to be imagined that any one will pay the lea&s;t Deference to our Ea&s;e and Happine&s;s, unle&s;s in our Turn we recede a little from our own Humours and purcha&s;e by our Deportment that Complacence, which every one de&s;ires to meet with in his Intercour&s;e with Society.</P>
<P>But as this Re&s;traint upon our Conduct &s;eems to be too much thrown off, it is not to be wondered that fre|quent Recour&s;e is had to Duelling, to decide Diffe|rences between tho&s;e, who have renounced the Gui|dance of Rea&s;on; which would &s;urely forbid us to &s;quander away the Life &mdash; be&s;towed upon us by the &s;upreme Being, upon &s;uch trivial Incidents, as for the mo&s;t Part occa&s;ion the&s;e Extremities. The <HI>Romans</HI> knew nothing of this modern Practice, which is entirely of <HI>French</HI> Growth, and, like many of the Fa&s;hions of that Country, &s;hould be exploded from all civilized Nations. It may not be improper to cite the Definition of Courage from &s;o fine a Gentleman
<PB N="166" REF="177">as Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on.</HI> In his elegant Poem, entitled the <HI>Campaign,</HI> he tells us,
<Q><L>True Courage dwells not in a troubled Flood</L>
<L>Of mounting Spirits and fermenting Blood;</L>
<L>Lodg'd in the Soul, by Virtue over-rul'd,</L>
<L>In&s;iam'd by Rea&s;on, and by Rea&s;on ccol'd.</L></Q> I never yet heard of an Affair between two Gentle|men, according to the polite Phra&s;e, but one or both of them was egregiou&s;ly in the Wrong; and, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, that if, indead of determining wilfully to &s;up|port Matters of no Moment, People could be brought to canva&s;s their Differences with &s;ome Degree of Tem|per and Chearfulne&s;s, we &s;hould not often have Advices from <HI>Morybone Fields,</HI> or any of the u&s;ual Scenes of Action upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions. To evince this, I &s;hall conclude with the following Story. I was once in Company at a Tavern with a Set of Gentlemen, when after much Mirth and Fe&s;tivity, one of the Party, who had been &s;ilent almo&s;t the whole Night, acco&s;ted a Gentleman who had contributed greatly to our Enter|tainment by a lively Vein of Fancy peculiar to him, in the following Words. <Q>Sir, (&s;ays he) taking him by the Button. I have &s;omething to communicate to you &mdash; I have ob&s;erved, Sir, &mdash; that you have been very facetious all Night, &mdash; you have run your Rig upon me, Sir, and &s;o &mdash; I de&s;ire you will meet me To-morrow Morning in <HI>Pancras</HI> Burying-Ground.</Q> &mdash; A Blood of the Town would perhaps have been fired at this Propo&s;al; but my Friend received it with great Compo&s;ure, and while the re&s;t of the Company were &s;truck dumb at the Solemnity of the Challenge, he turns to him with a Mixture of Je&s;t and Earne&s;t in his Countenance, and whi&s;pers <Q>in <HI>Pancras</HI> Burying Ground, Sir?</Q> <Q>Yes, Sir, in <HI>Pancras</HI> Bury|ing
<PB N="167" REF="178">Ground without fail</Q>&mdash;Very well, Sir,&mdash; <Q>mu&s;t I bring my Shroud with me?</Q></P>
<P>The Plea&s;antry of this Que&s;tion excited a general Laugh in the Room, and the &s;olemn Gentleman could not re&s;i&s;t the Impul&s;e of Mirth; he joined in the Cho|rus, and, as &s;oon as he recovered from his Fit of Merri|ment, exclaimed, "You're a brave Boy &mdash; give us your Hand.&mdash;I'll never meet you, but on a Party of Plea|&s;ure, and to that you may command me whenever you plea&s;e."</P>

<P>_A Lively Imagination is, if I may u&s;e <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ion, great Nature's &s;econd Cour&s;e; for not content to have enjoyed the intellectual Plea&s;ures immediately ari|&s;ing from the Beauty of external Objects, or the tran|&s;ient Scenes of Life, it frequently, when they have vani&s;hed and di&s;appeared, makes fond Excur&s;ions after them again; and even in our Sleep, it will occa&s;ionally recall the Objects of our waking Reflection, and from thence receive livelier Sen&s;ations, than were perhaps occa&s;ioned by the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion. Though there are many fanta&s;tic Circum&s;tances in the&s;e Night Thoughts, if I may be &s;o allowed to call our Dreams, yet, on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, we &s;ometimes find our&s;elves pre&s;ented with agreeable Vi&s;ions, and, amid&s;t the wilde&s;t Vagaries of Fancy, we can often trace &s;omething like ju&s;t Rea&s;oning, and a real Picture of Life. As I take this to have been the Ca&s;e with me a few Nights &s;ince, I &s;hall make no Apology, for throwing my Dream upon Paper this Day.</P>
<P>I found my&s;elf on a &s;udden, near a large intricate Wood, which I had the Curio&s;ity to enter. A whim|&s;ical band of Hope and Fear, Joy and Grief, Pain and Plea&s;ure hovered over our Heads. Tender An|gui&s;h, &s;oft De&s;ire, plea&s;ing Agony were all inter|mixed, and in their motley Livery formed a many|coloured
<PB N="170" REF="181">Groupe. <HI>Cupid</HI> made violent Work with his Darts and Flames, and nothing was to be heard but tinkling Rills, falling Fountains, and love-&s;ick Sighs, by which the A&s;pen Leaves were perpetually kept in a ru&s;tling Tremor. The God of Love had by him a prodigious Quantity of Arrows, differently feathered, according to the various Effects, of which they were to be productive. This Circum&s;tance called to my Mind a beautiful Pa&s;&s;age in a Poem by Doctor <HI>Parnell.</HI></P>
<Q><L>And ev'ry Dart can boa&s;t a Kind,</L>
<L>Which &s;uits each proper Turn of Mind.</L>
<L>From the tow'ring <HI>Eagle's</HI> Plume</L>
<L>The <HI>generous Hearts</HI> accept their Doom.</L>
<L>Shot by the <HI>Peacock</HI>'s painted Eye</L>
<L>The vain and <HI>airy Lovers</HI> die.</L>
<L>For <HI>careful</HI> Dames and <HI>frugal</HI> Men</L>
<L>The Shafts are &s;peckled by the <HI>Hen.</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Pyes</HI> and <HI>Parrots</HI> deck the Darts,</L>
<L>When <HI>Prattling</HI> wins the panting Hearts.</L>
<L>When from the <HI>Voice</HI> the Pa&s;&s;ions &s;pring,</L>
<L>The warbling <HI>Finch</HI> affords a Wing:</L>
<L>Together, by the Sparrow &s;tung,</L>
<L>Down fall the <HI>Wanton</HI> and the <HI>Young;</HI></L>
<L>And fledg'd by <HI>Gee&s;e</HI> the Weapons fly,</L>
<L>When others love they know not why.</L></Q>
<P>It was not unplea&s;ant to ob&s;erve the Variety of Im|pre&s;&s;ions that were occa&s;ioned in both Sexes by this &s;trange Flight of Arrows. Men I perceived in clo&s;e pur&s;uit of blooming Virgins, merely from the impul&s;e of Vanity; and I &s;aw &s;everal Nymphs running, with the utmo&s;t Precipitation, from their Lovers; though by their Manner of looking back, and the ru&s;tling they made in the Trees, there was room for Conjecture that they did not de&s;ire entirely to e&s;cape.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="182">Plea&s;ing as the Sen&s;ations of Love are, I could ob|&s;erve that very unhappy Effects were often the Con&s;e|quences. Many there were, who&s;e Mien &s;poke a De|jection of Spirits, and they were frequently driven to &s;uch Extremes, that they laid violent Hands on their own Lives. As I travelled on, I &s;aw &s;everal hanging on Bows of Trees; and on the Waters, which were &s;welled with Tears, and ruffled with Sighs, floated many a pallid <HI>Corp&s;e;</HI> in their Countenances I could plainly &s;ee the Traces of that &s;ickly Luxury of Thought, which is &s;o apt to &s;ettle into a fixed De&s;pair.</P>
<P>From this Scene of Di&s;tre&s;s, I turned away as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and was relieved from my Unea&s;ine&s;s, by the Sight of a few, who &s;eemed to be happy in their Pa&s;&s;ion; who&s;e Hearts felt a mutual Warmth, and who&s;e Eyes were brightened into Gladne&s;s. They walked Arm in Arm down the flow'ry Meads, inter|changing mutual Glances of Affection; though ever and anon &s;ucceeded Anger, Su&s;picion, open War, and Peace again. In the Center of the Wood, &s;tood a Temple &s;acred to VIRTUE, where all, who were de|&s;irous of leading a Life of Happine&s;s, were directed to bend their Cour&s;e, in Order there to be united to|gether in Bands of cha&s;te Affection. I was &s;orry to find that &s;ome of the Ladies had not Re&s;olution to per|&s;evere in this Path: Whether it was owing to loo&s;e De|&s;ires or &s;educing Temptation, I cannot decide; certain it is, they tired in their Journey, and &s;tepped a&s;ide with their Paramours to &s;eque&s;tred Bowers; from whence they were afterwards di&s;carded into the thorny Parts of the Wood, for the Remainder of their Days; but even of the&s;e, a few there were, who after their Digre&s;&s;ion, &s;till found Means to be introduced into the Temple; whither they were however pur&s;ued by an old Hag, called SCANDAL, who never yet has been known to let them entirely efface the Remembrance of their Error.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="183">The Ladies, who kept on a due Cour&s;e, never failed to lead the Men in Captivity after them to the Temple, from whence, after a &s;hort Ceremony, they were di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed in Pairs, to commence the Road for Life. Three different Paths were open to their Choice, and a Guide &s;tood at each Entrance to receive them. The fir&s;t was of a cold di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Temper, who took every Thing alike, and his Name was INDIFFERENCE. The &s;econd had Eyes of a greeni&s;h Ca&s;t, and he &s;eemed to loath the Food, which he notwith&s;tanding eagerly &s;wallowed. This Per&s;onage was called JEALOUSY, and the third by an Openne&s;s of Countenance, a &s;trong Ex|pre&s;&s;ion of quick Sen&s;ibility and cordial Affection, was known to be FRIENDSHIP. Too many gave them&s;elves up to INDIFFERENCE, and in&s;tantly an Inattention to each other's Wants &s;ucceeded in their Brea&s;ts; the Men betook them&s;elves to Midnight Shouts and Re|velry, and the Fair to Parties of Tea, and Routs, and Drums, by which Means every &s;park of Love was &s;oon extingui&s;hed, and the Gratification of their own &s;eparate Inclinations was their only Study.</P>
<P>The Walks of JEALOUSY were craggy, dangerous, and &s;teep, full of Thorns, Briars and Brambles. In the Heart, where before Gladne&s;s and Joy revelled &s;ecure, aro&s;e Anxiety, Di&s;tru&s;t, and Perturbation of Spirit. The di&s;tempered Fancy &s;tarted at Scenes of its own Creation, and, in a Fit of Madne&s;s, hurried many a tortured Wretch down the Precipice of Fate, or let fall its Vengeance on its Neighbour. What was ob|&s;ervable in this Part was, that though &s;ometimes there were the Appearances, the real Foot&s;teps of Guilt could no where be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The very &s;mall Number under the Guidance of FRIENDSHIP enjoyed a pure heart-felt Tranquillity; and the fierce De&s;ire and impatient Wi&s;h, which had formerly actuated their Minds, having now &s;ub&s;ided, a &s;teady and uniform Flame &s;ucceeded, not unlike the
<PB N="173" REF="184">mild refre&s;hing Air of a placid Evening, after the Fer|vor of an hot Summer's Day. Glad Suns ro&s;e over their Heads, and kindly Nights lulled them in each other's Arms. A &s;miling Race grew up around them, and the Culture of their young and tender Minds af|forded a plea&s;ing Employment; they journey'd on thro' Life, ble&s;&s;ed with the Sun&s;hine of the Soul, till, at length, the ea&s;y Di&s;&s;olution of Nature put a Period to all human Felicity.</P>
<P>Here I could not help exclaiming with the Poet;
<Q><L>O grant me thus to live, and thus to die!</L>
<L>Who &s;prung from Kings, &s;hall know le&s;s Joy than I.</L></Q></P>
<P>The whole Scene appeared &s;o completely happy, that I began to feel &s;ome Approaches towards Envy; which &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed my Spirits, that I was in&s;tantly awaked, and the ideal Pro&s;pect vani&s;hed into Air.</P>

<P>_THERE are few Terms which are applied with greater Impropriety, than tho&s;e cha|racteri&s;tical Appellations, which Men u&s;ual|ly be&s;tow on their Acquaintance, or on others, in who&s;e Company and Conver&s;ation they may at any Time have been ca&s;ually engaged. Every Cha|racter, indeed, is formed by the Prevalence of &s;ome particular Pa&s;&s;ion, which influences the Temper, and gives a ca&s;ting Weight to the Genius of the Per&s;on in whom it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. But no Rules that I know of, have been yet laid down, nor is there any certain Standard which &s;hould fix the Degree of Elevation, to which the ruling Pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ri&s;e, before it can have Strength &s;ufficient to determine the Character.</P>
<P>The Reader mu&s;t, however, be informed, that I am not &s;peaking of tho&s;e moral Qualifications, or Endow|ments
<PB N="175" REF="186">of the Heart, which &s;peculative Writers have taken &s;o much idle Pains to adorn and recommend; and which Men of Sen&s;e, or Men of the World, have una|nimou&s;ly agreed in rejecting, as unworthy of their &s;e|rious Notice. The Qualities I mean are pure Vir|tues of the Head or Face; Properties, which enable the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to a&s;&s;ume a &s;olemn A&s;pect at Incidents, which &s;et the re&s;t of the Table on a Roar; or to inter|rupt what is truly &s;erious and grave, by impertinent Que&s;tions of Levity and Mirth; or la&s;tly, to condemn and cavil, when all the World &s;ees the highe&s;t Rea&s;ons for Applau&s;e and Admiration. The Effects which the&s;e Cau&s;es produce in Life, however various and compli|cated in their Appearance, may be reduced to the three general Sources of Wit, Humour, and Critici&s;m, and as the Pretenders to the&s;e &s;everal Qualities are infinite in Number, I have determined on a certain Standard, in order to regulate and adju&s;t their Claims. The Me|thod I propo&s;e is, to decide their different Preten&s;ions by the Height and Stature of the Body.</P>
<P>And le&s;t this &s;hould be con&s;idered as a wild chime|rical De&s;ign, I mu&s;t beg Leave to a&s;&s;ure my Reader, that the Theory I am forming is built upon the late&s;t Di&s;coveries, and mo&s;t uncontroverted Principles of true Philo&s;ophy. It is po&s;&s;ible however, that Per&s;ons of an over-refining Curio&s;ity, may be able to rai&s;e &s;ome Ob|jections to what I am going to advance, but as every Thing is liable to be called in Que&s;tion by tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to cavil, they will give me but little Pain upon that Head. The plaine&s;t Truths have been di&s;|puted, and the mo&s;t extravagant Opinions have been fortunate enough to meet with their Advocates and Ad|mirers. Now, I would have &s;uch People recollect what are the general Apprehen&s;ions ari&s;ing in the Mind, on the Sight of an uncommon Stature; and how favour|able, withal, even the Notions of the Vulgar are to an unu&s;ual Height of Per&s;on. Is it not commonly &s;up|po&s;ed,
<PB N="176" REF="187">that Men of this &s;uperior Eminence po&s;&s;e&s;s as &s;uperior Parts, and extraordinary Degrees of Merit. From this Principle, my little Friend of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> is univer&s;ally cen&s;ured, as falling &s;hort of a true Hero, by near half a Foot; whil&s;t his more a&s;piring Antagoni&s;t is allowed to have all the nece&s;&s;ary Dimen&s;ions, re|quired both by ancient and modern Precedents, to con|&s;titute the heroic Character.</P>
<P>It is an Axiom in Philo&s;ophy, which few, I hope, will be &s;o hardy as to deny, that the Soul is all and all in every Part. From hence it is obvious, that the Body which is a Covering only for the Aetherial Particle that is lodged within it, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily receive its Di|men&s;ions from the Vigour of the Spirit, which actuates the exterior Frame. The greater Portion of Fire this Spirit is endued with, its ela&s;tic Qualities will be pro|portionably &s;tronger; and the Dimen&s;ions of the Body will be protruded to a Size, exactly of the &s;ame Dimen|&s;ions with the Soul which informs it. On this &s;imple Hypothe&s;is, which I imagine cannot be ea&s;ily di&s;proved, I proceed to &s;ettle the re&s;pective Qualifications of the different Pretenders, who have been mentioned above.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, tho&s;e who, with gentle <HI>William</HI> in the Play, boa&s;t them&s;elves not on Account of their Wi&s;|dom, but as they have a <HI>pretty Wit,</HI> do not exceed the lowe&s;t Degree of our appointed Standard. It is not in Nature, that &s;uch Per&s;ons can ri&s;e in their Stature, above the Height of five Feet and &s;ix Inches. For Wit, which is merely an Exerci&s;e of the Tongue, doth not require the &s;ame Bulk and Dimen&s;ions, which are e&s;&s;en|tial to Qualifications of a &s;uperior Order. It is evi|dently a much le&s;s Exertion of the interior Faculties, than what are productive of that Talent which we call Humour. Hence we mu&s;t advance a little in our Standard; and can admit no one to be a Man of real Humour, who does not come up to the full Height of five Feet and eight Inches; and this &s;mall Progre&s;&s;ion is the
<PB N="177" REF="188">more allowable, as a con&s;iderable Part of Humour is frequently expre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch Feats of Body, as require &s;ome little Degree of Size and Strength. Giving a Friend a violent and unexpected Slap upon the Back, or the dexterous Leaping over Chairs and Tables, have been often regarded as &s;o many undoubted Signs of ge|nuine Humour; and are generally agreed to denote a mo&s;t facetious Vein of Plea&s;antry, in the Authors of &s;uch exqui&s;ite Jokes. It will &s;ometimes further happen, that the&s;e two Qualities may be blended in the &s;ame Per&s;on; as I doubt not but many of my Readers can recollect &s;everal of their Acquaintance, who are your only Men of Wit and Humour. Now, this Conjunction manife&s;tly implies a much &s;uperior Energy of Soul; and con&s;equently, a &s;till higher Advancement in our Scale of characteri&s;tic Excellencies. The&s;e Candidates for Fame will accordingly ri&s;e two Inches above tho&s;e who are mentioned la&s;t; and none are to pa&s;s under this Denomination for the future, but who&s;e Height is five Feet ten. For the&s;e Qualities, when thus united, will frequently exert them&s;elves in Strokes of Gallantry and Mirth, which are &s;o much the more honourable as they are dangerous to the Per&s;on or the Pur&s;e of the ingenious Arti&s;t, who has the Courage or Curio&s;ity to attempt the Experiment. The demoli&s;hing of Win|dows, knocking down of Watchmen, bilking of Wai|ters at Places of Entertainment, with other In&s;tances of the like Kind, are very laudable and convincing Proofs of the&s;e compound Qualities, re&s;iding together in the &s;ame Habitation. The la&s;t Quality, which greatly overtops the re&s;t, and is indeed the Crown and Perfec|tion of all, is the wonderful and mo&s;t ingenious Faculty of modern Critici&s;m. And as this is, in the mo&s;t exalted Manner, the Gift of Nature, whoever has the Happi|ne&s;s to be born a true Critic, is at lea&s;t &s;ix Feet com|plete. A Critic is the Ma&s;ter-piece and noble&s;t Work of Nature; and may ju&s;tly be expected to bear about
<PB N="178" REF="189">him &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hing Tokens, which will enable a Spectator, at the fir&s;t View, to acknowledge and revere his Merits. Hence &s;he has be&s;towed on him a more than ordinary Portion of the <HI>Daring</HI> and <HI>Tremendous;</HI> and the&s;e would appear to very little Effect in a Per&s;on of le&s;s Dimen&s;ions, than tho&s;e which we have here a&s;&s;igned him. The Wit may be pert and &s;anguine; the Man of Humour confident or overbearing; but it is the Critic alone, who glares horribly terrific. His every Look freezes the young Author's Blood; and at the Sound of his Voice, the rooted Seats have been known to be torn from the Ground, and hurled vio|lently through the Air, in furious and wild Commotion. Phaenomena, like the&s;e, can only be produced by that iron Strength of Lungs, and brazen Audacity of Fi|gure, which Nature has &s;o liberally imparted to the modern Critic.</P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary to obviate an Objection ari&s;ing from popular Prejudice, that the Science of Criti|ci&s;m being to examine into the Merit of all Productions of Genius and Learning, it does not &s;eem to demand the Size and Dimen&s;ions which I have made e&s;&s;ential to the Character; but the Objectors, I apprehend, are mi&s;taken in the End of modern Critici&s;m; and have not perhaps duly reflected on the nece&s;&s;ary Qualities to di&s;charge the Province they are de&s;irous of allotting it. To execute that Ta&s;k, would require a moderate Por|tion of Sen&s;e, Ta&s;te and Judgment, under the Direc|tion of Mode&s;ty and Candour; Talents &s;o little prac|ti&s;ed by tho&s;e who have taken up the Occupation of a a Critic, that they appear on all Occa&s;ions not to have the lea&s;t Conception of them. Whoever will give him|&s;elf Leave to con&s;ider, that the Character of a Critic, a Wit, and Man of Humour, in the pre&s;ent E&s;timation of the World, is &s;upported wholly by Mechanical Ope|rations, in which the Under&s;tanding has no Manner of Share, he will ea&s;ily agree with me, that the &s;ure&s;t
<PB N="179" REF="190">Method to di&s;cover tho&s;e Characters, mu&s;t be taken from that Part which is principally concerned; and as we can truly judge from outward Appearances alone, I have &s;hewn to a Demon&s;tration that the Stature of a Per&s;on is the only infallible Criterion, by which we can decide, on the Ju&s;tne&s;s of his Preten&s;ions; and that no one for the future can have any Right to ei|ther of tho&s;e Characters, but who&s;e Dimen&s;ions will exactly tally with the Mea&s;ures of this Standard.</P>

<P>_AFTER &s;auntering about for &s;ome Time the other Morning in <HI>Gray's-Inn-Gardens,</HI> I withdrew to the Edifice rai&s;ed by the great Sir <HI>Francis Bacon,</HI> where I &s;carce had &s;eated my&s;elf, when I perceived an elderly Gentleman ha&s;tening towards me. He was of a ruddy, hale Complexion, but had the Air of one &s;omewhat di&s;concerted in his Mind. Scraping the Ground with one Leg drawn backwards, and holding out his Hat at Arm's Length, he he&s;itated a De&s;ire to know if I was Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> the entertaining Writer. Upon an&s;wering him in the Affirmative, with Regard to the Name, and at the &s;ame Time, expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome Doubt about the Compliment made to me as an Author, the Gentleman immediately looked grave, and &s;haking his Head, <Q>Aye, Sir, &s;ays he, you are the very Man I want,&mdash;I mu&s;t be a little trouble&s;ome to you for your Advice in an Affair that weighs heavily on my Spi|rits, and a Friend has advi&s;ed me to apply to Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> for his Opinion.</Q>&mdash;Upon this, I a&s;&s;ured him of my Inclination to &s;erve him, and as I perceived he had not yet dive&s;ted him&s;elf of his Diffidence, I begg'd of him to proceed without any farther Ceremony; which he accordingly complied with.</P>
<P><Q>My Name, Sir, rea&s;&s;umed the Stranger, is <HI>Oldca&s;tle,</HI> of <HI>Oldca&s;tle-Hall</HI> in the North of <HI>England,</HI>&mdash;nothing
<PB N="182" REF="193">but an Affair of Con&s;equence &s;hould have brought me upwards of two hundred Miles to Town;&mdash;I have fetched my elde&s;t Son up with me, as I think of putting him to &s;omething&mdash;a wounded &s;harp Boy he is;&mdash; he's a Tartar for your <HI>Greek</HI> and your <HI>Latin,</HI> and the be&s;t Mimick in the World;&mdash;Odds my Life, he'd mi|mick all the Waggoners as he come along the Road, &mdash;but that's neither here nor there&mdash;I now think it Time, as I told you, to put him to Bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;I have a large Family, and but a finall E&s;tate was handed to me by my Ance&s;tors;&mdash;the Land was &s;urveyed in the Time of <HI>Queen Elizabeth,</HI> and there is ju&s;t the &s;ame Number of Acres to this Day &mdash; I would have my Son be the Fir&s;t of his Family that improved it, and then he may help me to provide for his Brother and Si&s;ters&mdash;but look ye, Sir, in this large Town, I am mainly puzzled what to put him to;&mdash;I am afraid, I have made &s;uch another Journey to <HI>London,</HI> as Sir <HI>Francis Wronghead</HI> in the Play, and unle&s;s &s;ome &s;uch good Gentleman as you a&s;&s;i&s;ts me, I mu&s;t go back in the old &s;queaking Stage-Coach, with|out doing my Bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;if you plea&s;e, I'll &s;tep and fetch <HI>Dicky,</HI> he's at the <HI>Bull</HI> and <HI>Gate Inn,</HI> and will be here in a Crack.</Q> Here he pau&s;ed for a Reply. As the Matter he con&s;ulted me upon was of no &s;mall Importance, I begged Leave to be &s;ilent for the pre|&s;ent, and promi&s;ed I would give him an An&s;wer in this Day's Lucubration. Mr. <HI>Oldca&s;tle</HI> was perfectly &s;atis|fied, and withdrew in the Fullne&s;s of his Joy, after a&s;|&s;uring me, that he would always read my Paper, and that he would leave Orders with the Publi&s;her to &s;end it to his Hou&s;e in the Country every <HI>Saturday</HI> for the future.</P>
<P>The Direction of a young Gentleman's Genius to any particular Profe&s;&s;ion, is a Point of more Con&s;e|quence, than perhaps appears to the Inattentive; as to this Step is often to be imputed the Happine&s;s or
<PB N="183" REF="194">Mi&s;ery of the Per&s;on in the en&s;uing Part of his Days. This Circum&s;tance in Life, is not unlike what we &s;ee at a Bowling-Green, where, before a Man plays off, he &s;hould con&s;ider the Bya&s;s of his Bowl, and if it is delivered with Judgment, it makes its Way to the de|&s;tined Point; but, if there &s;hould be too much Rapi|dity in the Out&s;et, or if a proper Degree of Force &s;hould be wanting to forward it, it either runs beyond the Mark, or lags in the Middle of its Progre&s;s. On this Account it is no ea&s;y Matter to advi&s;e upon &s;o de|licate a Point, as I have now to handle.</P>
<P>I have con&s;idered all the Profe&s;&s;ions, and I really think them very precarious. Many great E&s;tates and eminent Titles have been derived from the Law; but it is now reduced to &s;uch a State, that without very great Friends, a Per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Talents of a <HI>Murray,</HI> &s;hall never ri&s;e to any Degree of Eminence. With Regard to Phy&s;ick, a Genius may &s;pend his Time in &s;aving the Lives of Patients in Garrets, and doing real Services to Mankind, without any Emolument to him&s;elf, while <HI>Doctor Slaughter</HI> puts his Licence to kill in Execution upon Thou&s;ands of his Maje&s;ty's well|di&s;po&s;ed Subjects, and lolls at Ea&s;e in his Chariot.</P>
<P>In the Army, it is to be feared, that Preferment goes more by Intere&s;t, than Merit: And there is not a Wind that can blow from any Quarter of the Heavens, but fills the Merchant's Imagination with pictured Scenes of Shipwrecks; and while he breaks the Seal of a Letter, he trembles for fear of receiving the News of &s;ome Corre&s;pondent's Failure. The Stage, indeed, &s;eems to be a Place, where Merit meets its Reward, but even there, there are great Di&s;advantages; and though a Genius &s;hould &s;tart up with the Talents of a <HI>Garrick,</HI> and Per&s;on of a <HI>Barry,</HI> it is odds, but his Eye is one Time or other knock'd out by a well directed Apple.</P>
<P>There is, however, a Way of Life, which I cannot help thinking the mo&s;t eligible, and, not to keep the
<PB N="184" REF="195">Reader any longer in Su&s;pen&s;e, the Occupation, I mean, is that of a Game&s;ter. After mature Delibera|tion, the Gentlemen of this Calling &s;eem to me to be in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of greater Advantages than any of the o|thers, and the Inconveniences attending them, are not upon a Ballance with the Conveniences.</P>
<P>A Game&s;ter, from a con&s;tant Habit of venturing large Sums upon the Turning up of a Card, or a Die, acquires that thorough Di&s;regard for Money, which is &s;o much recommended by the Philo&s;ophers. Like <HI>Catiline</HI> in <HI>Sallu&s;t,</HI> he is <HI>alieni appetens, &s;ui profu&s;is;</HI> at the &s;ame Time, that he is de&s;irous of his Friends Sub&s;tance, he has the Plea&s;ure of being profu&s;e in his own private Gratifications. In&s;tead of creeping through Life with that Mediocrity of Spirit, which depre&s;&s;es the Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Game&s;ter lives with an Eclat; <HI>Ryan, Venable,</HI> or <HI>Tomkyns,</HI> &s;upply him with his Wines, and he is every Hour gaining an In&s;ight into Men and Manners. As rude Health has too much of the Country in it, and of cour&s;e is not very plea&s;ing to the Ladies, he acquires by his midnight Vigil, a pal|lid meagre Countenance, which generally denotes an intimate Knowledge of the Town; and while others deceive one another in the Face of Day, a Game&s;ter has the Mode&s;ty to fly to the Covert of the Night, and, if I may u&s;e the Poet's Words, <HI>The pale Moon and Stars alone are con&s;cious of the Theft.</HI> While the Man of Genius is left undi&s;turbed in his Study, the gay-dre&s;&s;ed Footman knocks at the Game&s;ter's Doos, and leaves the agreeable Card to invite him to my Lady <HI>Bragwell</HI>'s. There he has an Opportunity of carrying on a De&s;ign upon a Lady's Money and Vir|tue at the &s;ame Time, and if he can once contrive to get her in his Books, he &s;inds it no difficult Matter to make her give <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Security, and when once a Woman's Body is mortgaged, there is no Equity of Redemption.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="196">There are many other Conveniences annexed to a Life of Play, and therefore I would have my Friend Mr. <HI>Oldca&s;tle</HI> train up his Son to this Profe&s;&s;ion; and to encourage all Beginners in this Way, I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s this Paper with only one Article of True Intelligence, which I take to be of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence to all &s;uch Adventurers.</P>

<P>LATELY arrived in this Town from <HI>Paris,</HI> the <HI>Marquis de Fourberie,</HI> well known to many of the Nobility and Gentry, who have been in Foreign Parts. He is well ver&s;ed in all the different Branches of Gam|ing, and he teaches how to play the whole Game in a Month's Time.</P>
<P>He has taken an Apartment for this Purpo&s;e in the <HI>Hay-market,</HI> where he reads Lectures every Day in the Week, except <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> when he attends the Gentle|men of the City, at his Room near the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> where he will let any young Prentice or City Smart into the Secret, without Hindrance of Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>He has taught, &s;ince his coming here, &s;everal Game|&s;ters of both Sexes, and it was he in&s;tructed the <HI>Sca|ramouch,</HI> who carried off fifteen hundred Pounds from the la&s;t Ma&s;querade.</P>
<P>Gentlemen and Ladies may learn in a private Man|ner, without being over&s;een by Strangers while Learn|ing, and for the more expeditiou&s;ly compleating them, there is a Set to practi&s;e from Seven in the Evening till Three in the Morning.</P>
<P>As &s;everal Per&s;ons have, and do think &s;till, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to learn without going into Company, he thinks proper to inform them of his Method for that Purpo&s;e. He fir&s;t teaches the Scholar the Shuffle, then the different Methods of Cutting; next he explains his
<PB N="186" REF="197">Rules, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;econd-hand Cards; when the Party is &s;o qualified, he makes his own Family &s;it down with them, where they play mo&s;t of the Games in Vogue; after the Per&s;on has learned in this Manner, which he or &s;he may do in a very &s;hort Time, he dares an&s;wer for them, they will be qualified to play in any genteel Company whatever.</P>
<P><HI>Jacta e&s;t alea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> the <HI>Marquis</HI> had not a Stitch of Cloaths when he began, and he now &s;hines away with his <HI>Dre&s;den</HI> Ruffles, and Diamond Ring. Such Per&s;ons as are de|&s;irous to learn any Branch exce&s;&s;ive quick, may come twice or thrice a Day, or lodge and board in the Hou&s;e for the Time. He in&s;ures for a &s;mall Praemium, one thou&s;and Pounds a Year to any ingenious young Gen|tleman who will make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of his Rules. He &s;ells Dice for Gentlemen to carry in their Pockets.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_DERISION and Contempt have been for many Ages the Portion of mo&s;t Authors, whom Rank in Life, or Superiority of Abilities, have not eminently rai&s;ed above the common Herd of their Fraternity; and the Name of Poet, in every Company where the Word is men|tioned,
<PB N="187" REF="198">is &s;ure to excite ludicrous Ideas of Garrets, unwa&s;hed Shirts, and unpaid Taylors. By the&s;e Means it has obtained, that younger Brothers had rather take a Pi&s;tol or a Pack of Cards in their Hands to rai&s;e a Livelihood, than endeavour to help out the Year's In|come by the Exertion of their Talents; dreading the Infamy of Wit, more than any other Imputation, that can be fixed upon their Characters.</P>
<P>This Effect is not produced without a Concurrence of many efficient Cau&s;es, among which the principal one is, the known Poverty of the Generality of the Tribe that write; and among all the Inconveniences of Indigence, it has been well &s;aid, that there is not a greater Hard&s;hip, than that Ridicule, which it brings upon tho&s;e who labour under its La&s;h.</P>
<Q><L>Nil habit infaelix Paupertas durius in &s;e,</L>
<L>Quam quod ridiculos homines facit.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>The Belly has been often called the Teacher of Art, and the In&s;pirer of Wit; but, I apprehend, this Maxim can only be under&s;tood of a full Belly.</P>
<Q>Satur e&s;t cum dicit Horatius Evoe;</Q>
<P><HI>Horace</HI> was warmed with good Cheer, when he calls out to <HI>Bacchus</HI> to &s;pare him, &s;ays <HI>Juvenal;</HI> and the &s;ame Author adds, with an elegant Vein of Plea&s;antry, that fine Writing is the Production of an exalted Mind, free from the Sollicitude of procuring a Blanket; and that if <HI>Virgil</HI> wanted a Lodging and a Boy to attend him, the Snakes would fall from the Fury, which he &s;o admirably de&s;cribes, and the Trumpet would not &s;ound to War with &s;o &s;hrill a Clangor.
<Q><L>Nam &s;i Virgilio puer &amp; tolerabile dee&s;&s;et</L>
<L>Ho&s;pitium, caderent omnes &agrave; crinibus Hydri,</L>
<L>Surda nibil gemeret grave Buccina.&mdash;</L></Q>
<PB N="188" REF="199">It is not therefore to be wondered, that Poverty &s;hould dimini&s;h the Poet's Lu&s;tre, &s;ince it not only renders him an Object of Contempt, but extingui&s;hes the Fire of his Genius; and &s;uch is the Fate or Perver&s;ene&s;s of Au|thors, that, to Circum&s;tances, which they cannot re|move, they are indu&s;trious to add many of their own creating; &s;o true is the Saying of Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI> that wherever Wit is, it is always contriving its own Ruin. The Race of Writers are extremely ira&s;cible, prone to Malice and Envy towards the Man, whom they per|ceive in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Fame, and, in&s;tead of endeavour|ing to equal him with an hone&s;t Emulation, their Aim is, to &s;natch the Laurel from his Brow, or if they can|not reach it, to wither it on his Head by the bitter Bla&s;ts of Calumny and Detraction. <HI>Voltaire</HI> delivers him&s;elf on this Topic with &s;o much Delicacy and good Sen&s;e, that I &s;hall here tran&s;late the Pa&s;&s;age. <Q>It is a Di&s;grace, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> to the human Mind, that the Re|public of Letters &s;hould be infe&s;ted with per&s;onal Re&s;entments, private Cabals, and mean Intrigues, which &s;hould only &s;ub&s;i&s;t among the Slaves of For|tune. What Advantage can accrue to Authors from this Civil War? Their Animo&s;ities have no other Tendency, than to depreciate a Profe&s;&s;ion, which it is in their Power to render re&s;pectable. Why &s;hould the Art of thinking finely, the greate&s;t Ble&s;|&s;ing Man can &s;hare from Heaven, become an Object of Ridicule? It is really hard, that Men of Genius &s;hould render them&s;elves, by their mutual Invectives, the Sport of Pools, and in&s;tead of being revered as the Ma&s;ters and In&s;tructors of the Public, turn out the Buffoons and Zanies of the Town.</Q></P>
<P>There is another Rea&s;on, which contributes &s;trongly to bring a Di&s;reputation upon Poets, and that is, their mean and pro&s;titute Servility to a Set of Men, whom they call their Patrons. The&s;e Gentlemen are for the mo&s;t Part eager after Prai&s;e, and carele&s;s of the Means,
<PB N="189" REF="200">by which they might obtain an hone&s;t Fame; hence the <HI>Parna&s;&s;ian</HI> Incen&s;e is extremely grateful, and is there|fore profu&s;ely offered up by every &s;cribbling Fool, who vainly thinks to wriggle him&s;elf into Preferment. But the Misfortune is, that what happens in this Ca&s;e is not an&s;werable to the Writer's Intention; his Patron plumes him&s;elf upon the imputed Accompli&s;hments, and glows with Rapture and Self Admiration, while for the Bard he feels no Pa&s;&s;ion but Contempt, and the re&s;t of the World with Plea&s;ure behold Infamy and Di&s;appoint|ment, the Rewards of Venality and Pro&s;titution.</P>
<P>As I have always entertained great good Wi&s;hes for the Gentlemen of the Quill, I have devi&s;ed a Method, by the Ob&s;ervance of which, they will be able to re|trieve, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, the Honour of their Calling, and obviate that Torrent of Contumely, which at pre|&s;ent bears hard upon them.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, I would have them frequently in|culcate, that Fortune is only the Deity of Fools; and, if &s;he has not been favourable to them, they had better enjoy a virtuous Independence in private, than by an ambitious Poverty, bring them&s;elves under the Contempt and Ridicule of the Affluent.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> In&s;tead of wa&s;ting Paper in mutual Calumny and Detraction, I would recommend to them to vent their Anger upon the Critics or the <HI>Male-voli;</HI> a Species of People highly prejudicial to the Cau&s;e of Literature, on whom no Severities can be too hard, as it is no|torious, that not one of the Race about Town at pre|&s;ent is any way fit for the Province he has u&s;urped; a total Ignorance of the learned Languages, and a la|mentable want of Ta&s;te, together with a plentiful Share of Spleen and Ill-nature, being the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Characteri&s;tics of the whole Tribe.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI> and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> I would advi&s;e my Brother. Wri|ters to di&s;pen&s;e their Panegyric with a little more Re|&s;erve, and always with an Eye to Truth; from whence<PB N="190" REF="201">it will follow, that they will find them&s;elves more court|ed by their Patrons, and their Butlers will the more readily conde&s;cend to hear them from the Side-Board. <HI>To maintain a Poet's Dignity and Ea&s;e,</HI> is a beautiful Sentiment of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> and his Life and Manners &s;hew that he carried it from Theory into Fractice.

<Q><L>Enough for half the greate&s;t of the&s;e Days,</L>
<L>To '&s;cape my Cen&s;ure, not expect my Prai&s;e.</L></Q> Whenever I reflect upon the Conduct of that great Genius, I find it hard to determine within my&s;elf, which holds mo&s;t of Admiration, the Finene&s;s of his Per|ceptions, and the Elegance of his Poetry, or that Grace of Character, and that unpro&s;tituted, dignified In|dependence, which will always do Honour to the Man. Doctor <HI>Swift</HI> likewi&s;e, with le&s;s Delicacy of Manners, jealou&s;ly pre&s;erved his own Re&s;pect; and &s;ure I am, that the Writings of the&s;e two great Authors, though they have both exqui&s;ite Fini&s;hings in their Kind, have always received an additional Lu&s;tre from the &s;elf-created Importance of their Characters.</P>

<P>_THERE is not a Plea&s;ure, which thrills through the tender Nerve of Imagination, but what receives additional Delight from numberle&s;s adventitious Circum&s;tances. To the <HI>A&s;&s;ociation of Ideas,</HI> explained by Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> may al&s;o be added the <HI>A&s;&s;ociation of Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> which recipro|cally
<PB N="192" REF="203">awaken each other, and agitate the Mind with their mixed Operation. Thus the primary Effect, which any Object or Land&s;kip may have on a Per&s;on's Ta&s;te, is heightened and enlarged beyond its Bounds; a Recollection of collateral Images &s;tarts upon the Fancy, the Pa&s;&s;ions pour in their auxiliar Influence, and our Joy is encrea&s;ed by &s;everal Sen&s;ations at once; like a River, which admits at different Inlets the tri|butary Illap&s;e of &s;everal le&s;&s;er Streams, and thence &s;welled above its Banks, di&s;pen&s;es Verdure and Fertility to all the Country round. That this is the Ca&s;e in many Situations of the Mind, will be obvious to any Body, that will but turn his Eyes inwards, and I be|lieve it is not more &s;o in any one In&s;tance, than the Joy we &s;eel from the Opening of the Spring.</P>
<P>In my Opinion, we are not acquainted with a more complicated Plea&s;ure: our Love of Novelty, which is a leading Principle in the Heart of Man, implanted in us for the mo&s;t benevolent Purpo&s;es by the Author of our Frame, is particularly gratified at this Sea&s;on of the Year; the Appearance, which Things a&s;&s;ume, is not only plea&s;ing to us on Account of its natural Beau|ty, but al&s;o from its Newne&s;s to the Eye. During the Winter, all Nature &s;eems to &s;uffer a melancholy Di&s;tre&s;s; the animal Creation droops, their Spirits &s;eem &s;unk into dumb De&s;pair, and we read their languid Situation in the mute imploring Eye; the vegetable World &s;eems al&s;o tending to Decay, and a general Scene of Calamity over&s;preads the Face of Nature. From this State to &s;ee gradually a new Creation emerging, and every Thing reviving with renovated Vigour, cannot fail of plea&s;ing our Imagination; the whole Race of animal Life feels the genial Influence of the &s;oft Sea&s;on; from a Turbulence of Clouds, and all the Inclemencies of the Elements, the Scene is &s;hifted to enlivening Suns, blue Skies, Hills cloathed with Verdure, imbowering
<PB N="193" REF="204">Shades, refre&s;hing Streams, and the Harmony of the Grove.</P>
<P>The learned Reader will perceive with what Elegance <HI>Virgil</HI> has de&s;cribed this vernal Delight in the Words of my Motto. The Pa&s;&s;age, from whence I have &s;e|lected the&s;e Lines, is carried on with an Air of En|thu&s;ia&s;m; he &s;eems particularly fond of this Sea&s;on, and the whole is clo&s;ed with a moral Reflection on the Providence of the &s;upreme Being, who placed this Part of the Year, as a Medium, to render the Tran&s;i|tion from inten&s;e Cold to the Heat of the Summer le&s;s perceptible to our Con&s;titutions. There are many &s;hort Sketches of this Nature in the &s;ame Author; we frequently find him ca&s;ting a &s;ide Glance this Way; and, I will venture to &s;ay, every Reader of Ta&s;te mu&s;t have been greatly delighted with the&s;e Bye-views; as on a Road the tran&s;ient Opening of an agreeable Pro&s;pect is always acceptable to the Traveller. <HI>Horace</HI> is al&s;o happy when giving a De&s;cription of the Spring; and <HI>Milton,</HI> the great Father of the Sublime in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poe&s;y, has in many Places touched it with great Delicacy. Per|haps &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful Imagery in his Poem is to be found in the &s;ofter Paintings of this Nature, which he has &s;o often taken Occa&s;ion to introduce.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the obvious Plea&s;ures of this Sea&s;on, already mentioned, there is another Circum&s;tance, which &s;till renders it more delightful; the Spring, more particularly than any other Time of the Year, is the Sea&s;on of Love. At this Juncture we feel the Sun warm at our Hearts; young Health &s;miles in the Virgin's Eye; the Morn or Evening Walks affords Sen&s;ations unfelt before; a plea&s;|ing Stillne&s;s runs o'er the Faculties of the Mind, and every Thing con&s;pires to fill the Heart, with what the Poet calls, <HI>the Spirit of Love and amorous Delight.</HI> By Love, I would not be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean a mere gro&s;s Impul&s;e of Pa&s;&s;ion, but that Elegance of De&s;ire, that Refinement of Ta&s;te, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the Gen|tleman,
<PB N="194" REF="205">and never fails of being acceptable to the amiable Sex.</P>
<P>Whatever may be rattled over a Bottle at a Tavern, we are obliged to the Ladies for the mo&s;t valuable Gratifica|tions of our Lives; and after all our high-boa&s;ted Rea|&s;on and our &s;uperior Abilities, to them it is owing that our Manners become more gentle, and our Sentiments acquire a finer Poli&s;h. Our Looks and Ge&s;tures a&s;&s;ume from them a molder Air, our Pa&s;&s;ions &s;often into Har|mony and Joy; and the Man, who has u&s;ed him&s;elf to this agreeable Conver&s;e, is acquainted with a thou|&s;and Delicacies in his Amu&s;ements, and &s;everal Elegan|cies in his Way of thinking, to which vulgar Souls are ab&s;olutely Strangers.</P>

<P>_IT is with un&s;peakable Plea&s;ure I have ob&s;erved for a con&s;iderable Time pa&s;t, that tho&s;e unhappy Divi&s;ions, which have been the Bane of Society, ever &s;ince the late Commotions in the North, are in a great Mea&s;ure re|conciled; at lea&s;t, &s;o far, as to make an Intercour&s;e be|tween People of different political Sentiments, not al|together impracticable. The Di&s;tinction of <HI>Whig,</HI> or <HI>Jacobite,</HI> &s;eems to be at pre&s;ent thought not e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary towards con&s;tituting a good Companion; and the Word HONEST appears to have acquired a more en|larged
<PB N="198" REF="209">Signification; in&s;omuch that, whenever we ho|nour a Man with that Appellation, it is generally under|&s;tood, that we mean &s;omething more, than a Per&s;on who is ready to drink a certain Set of Toa&s;ts. In &s;hort, the Enthu&s;ia&s;m of Party, in this Re&s;pect, is &s;o far abated, that one may &s;pend a chearful Evening with &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;anguine Friends to the Government, without dedicating a &s;ingle Gla&s;s to the Memory of King <HI>William;</HI> and I have more than once, within the&s;e la&s;t &s;ix Months, &s;at with &s;ome reputed Well-wi&s;hers to the exiled Family, without being under a Nece&s;&s;ity of ungartering my Stockings, and pulling off my Wig, at every Return of the Bottle. But, alas! what avails this Coalition? The Spirit of Party is &s;o intimately in|terwoven in the Con&s;titution of an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> that all Attempts to extingui&s;h it mu&s;t inevitably fail of Suc|ce&s;s: It may indeed be diverted, but will not admit of being eradicated.</P>
<P>The Truth of this Ob&s;ervation is &s;ufficiently mani|fe&s;ted, by the two powerful Factions, which now di&s;|unite this great Metropolis.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h for the Pen of <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> in order to trace the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of tho&s;e fatal Di&s;&s;en&s;ions, which &s;ow Di&s;cord in Families, make Breaches among Friends, embitter Society, and, if not timely re&s;trained, threaten Danger to the State.</P>
<P>The Reader, I believe, has anticipated me, and plainly &s;ees, that I can mean no other, than the Sects, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Denomination of <HI>Garrickeans</HI> and <HI>Barryi&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;everal Preten&s;ions of the Theatrical Leaders, from whom the Names of Di&s;tinction ju&s;t mentioned are derived, are &s;o extremely difficult to be adju&s;ted, that two Per&s;ons can hardly be found, within the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> who per&s;ectly agree in their Way of thinking upon this Head: And as the amiable Sex generally &s;upport, with great Impetuo&s;ity, their
<PB N="199" REF="210">favourite Principles, it is inconceivable to tho&s;e, who have not had Opportunity of ob&s;erving it, what Feuds and Animo&s;ities prevail among the female Partizans of the&s;e Heroes.</P>
<P>I was lately pre&s;ent at a Controver&s;y between two Ladies, who had adopted oppo&s;ite Sentiments, the one being a <HI>Garrickean,</HI> and the other a <HI>Barryi&s;t.</HI> The Di&s;pute be|gan in Form&mdash;the <HI>Garrickean</HI> in&s;i&s;ting upon it, that &s;he did not like <HI>Barry;</HI> and the <HI>Barryi&s;t</HI> prote&s;ting with equal Empha&s;is, that &s;he could not &s;o highly admire <HI>Gar|rick</HI>&mdash;Thus mutual Contradiction being given, the Debate &s;oon grew warm, and the <HI>Garrickean</HI> Lady enforced her Opinion with great Vehemence: <Q>There is &s;omething &s;o clever, &s;omething &s;o lively, &s;omething &s;o I don't know how in <HI>Garrick</HI>&mdash;And his Eyes &s;parkle &s;o, that, to be &s;ure, he is the &s;weete&s;t Creature in the World.</Q>&mdash;Her Antagoni&s;t with&s;tood this Torrent of Eloquence, and with no le&s;s Energy replied,&mdash; <Q>Nay, Madam, if you talk of Eyes, nobody can &s;ay, but <HI>Barry</HI> has as lovely Eyes as ever were &s;een&mdash;Then he is &s;o tall, and &s;o fine a Man, that, Lord ble&s;s me! there is no Compari&s;on&mdash;I am &s;ure, <HI>Garrick</HI> can't make Love &s;o well&mdash;come, now, you mu&s;t give that up.&mdash;Not I, upon my Honour, Ma'em, re&s;umes the <HI>Garrickean,</HI> why &s;hould I give it up? All the Gentlemen, and you mu&s;t allow they know be&s;t, &s;ay, <HI>Garrick</HI> is the fine&s;t <HI>Romeo.</HI></Q>&mdash;The Weight of this Rea&s;oning piqued the <HI>Barryi&s;t,</HI> and &s;he exclaimed, with no &s;mall Appearance of Indignation&mdash;<Q>P&s;haw! what &s;ignifies what the Men &s;ay? I don't mind it a Farthing;&mdash;they envy the dear Man, becau&s;e he is &s;o hand&s;ome.</Q>&mdash;The Earne&s;tne&s;s and Re&s;ent|ment, with which this was delivered, excited a general Laugh, and the Ladies had Prudence enough to &s;u&s;pend the Conte&s;t for that Evening; but I have been &s;ince informed, that they renewed it the next Day with re|doubled Vigour, and proceeded &s;o far, as to u&s;e &s;ome<PB N="200" REF="211">certain Figures of Speech, which are thought not quite con&s;i&s;tent with female Delicacy.</P>
<P>A wide Breach en&s;ued between the Di&s;putants, in Con&s;equence of this Di&s;agreement, which was in a few Days happily healed, by the Mediation of &s;ome Friends; and the Ladies now vi&s;it as u&s;ual, but have obliged them&s;elves in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner, for their mutual Quiet, never to mention, for the future, the Names of <HI>Garrick</HI> and <HI>Barry</HI> in the Company of each other.</P>
<P>I have only related this Affair, as a &s;light In&s;tance of the unhappy Effects attending our Party-Divi&s;ions. That they are productive of the greate&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s in the Conjugal State, is &s;o very notorious, that People of different Ways of thinking &s;eldom chu&s;e to engage with each other; being aware, that Feuds and Di&s;con|tents mu&s;t be unavoidable, when Man and Wife <HI>do not go the &s;ame Way.</HI> An intimate Acquaintance of mine, who is &s;trongly in the <HI>Garrickean</HI> Intere&s;t, paid his Ad|dre&s;&s;es to a very agreeable, and every-way-accompli&s;h'd young Lady; but a violent <HI>Barryi&s;t.</HI> The young Couple liked one another perfectly well, and there appeared no rea&s;onable Objection to the Match, but the Difference of Principles.</P>
<P>This, however, was an Ob&s;tacle not ea&s;ily to be got over. The Relations on both Sides had &s;everal Meet|ings, and many Difficulties aro&s;e in &s;ettling this Point, which was at la&s;t adju&s;ted by a Compromi&s;e. The Lawyer, who was employed to draw the Articles, re|ceived Directions to in&s;ert a Clau&s;e, importing, that all the Boys born of that Marriage &s;hould be bred up <HI>Garrickeans,</HI> and the Girls <HI>Barryi&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader, I believe, is &s;urprized, that I have not, in this Di&s;&s;ertation upon Parties, taken any Notice of the <HI>Quini&s;ts,</HI> a Faction, which, in its Time, has been by no Means contemptible, whether we con&s;ider the Bulk or Quality of the Leaders. The Rea&s;on is&mdash;I have ob&s;erved, that this Party is con&s;iderably declined,
<PB N="201" REF="212">&s;ince the Abdication of their Monarch; mo&s;t of them having &s;ub&s;cribed to the Revolution, which took Place in <HI>Goodman</HI>'s-<HI>Fields</HI> in the Year Forty-two; and tho&s;e few, who &s;till continue attached to this Cau&s;e, being old Men, from whom no Di&s;turbance can be expected in the female World.</P>
<P>That the&s;e Heart-burnings threaten Danger to the State, I think is very obvious. The Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Theatres is almo&s;t fini&s;hed, and, it is expected, that both Hou&s;es will be prorogued in a few Days, when many of the Members will go into the Country, and mo&s;t unque&s;tionably excite a Party-Spirit, where-ever they fix. We &s;hall hear from one Town, that the In|habitants are divided into <HI>Marri&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Scra&s;i&s;ts;</HI> from another, that the <HI>U&s;heri&s;ts</HI> have got the upper Hand, and the Favourers of <HI>Raftor</HI> do not dare to &s;hew their Faces. What Influence the&s;e Divi&s;ions may have upon the approaching Election, I leave to the Gentle|men in Power to con&s;ider, not doubting but they will thank me for this friendly Intimation, and make a pro|per U&s;e of it.</P>
<P>From this fair and candid Repre&s;entation of the pre|&s;ent State of Parties among us, many u&s;eful Reflections may be drawn, which, as they are extremely obvious, the Reader's good Sen&s;e will undoubtedly &s;ugge&s;t to him. I might here di&s;mi&s;s my Subject in the Words of <HI>Horace,</HI>
<Q>Verbum non amplius addam.</Q></P>
<P>But I am unwilling to conclude, without declaring my own Principles. I have the Satisfaction to &s;ay, that I am con&s;cious of being entirely free of Party-Prejudice &mdash;I am neither a <HI>Garrickean</HI> nor a <HI>Barryi&s;t,</HI> but be|tween both, in an hone&s;t Mean&mdash;I defy my greate&s;t Enemies to prove, that I ever gave a Clap or Hi&s;s, but according to the Dictates of my Con&s;cience&mdash; And, O my dear Countrymen and Countrywomen!
<PB N="202" REF="213">there is nothing I &s;o ardently de&s;ire, as an Union of all true Friends to our Theatrical Entertainments, in order to rouze the Directors of the <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> and <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Companies from their Lethargy, and make them &s;en&s;ible, that though the Public have a violent Appe|tite for Plays, and can feed on a <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet</HI> thirty or forty Times in a Sea&s;on, yet they would be glad of a little Variety&mdash;This &s;urely they may mode&s;tly ex|pect, as the heavy Sub&s;idies for the Maintenance of the&s;e States are rai&s;ed entirely upon them.

<Q>Contemptu Famae contemni Virtutes.
<BIBL><HI>TACITUS.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Sentiment, which is very beautifully expre&s;&s;ed in the Words of my Motto, grew naturally out of the Conver&s;ation, at the la&s;t Meeting of our Club; and to enforce it &s;till further, Mr. <HI>Gulliver,</HI> who then occupied the Chair, produced a Stricture of oriental Hi&s;tory, which, he believed, would impre&s;s the Reflection deeper on the Mind, as it carried with it the Admonitions of Expe|rience; and therefore, as &s;uch, I &s;hall recommend it to the Peru&s;al of my Readers.</P>
<P>In the Chronicles of the Sultans of the Ea&s;t, it is recorded, that when <HI>Othman</HI> held the Rank of Vi&s;ier under a Prince of the <HI>Sa&s;&s;anian</HI> Race, and by his faith|ful Councils added Security, Lu&s;tre, and Dignity to the Throne, his Son <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> di&s;play'd in his early Bloom all the Virtues which could endear him to the be&s;t of Fathers, and render him amiable in the Eyes of all Be|holders. <HI>Achmet</HI> the Hermit, who had been called forth from his Retreat, in order to attend the Cultiva|tion of his tender Mind, had taken care to &s;ea&s;on him with Religion, and to inflame his young Imagination with the De&s;ire of a fair and hone&s;t Fame. The Sage well knew that this Propen&s;ity would be a &s;trong &s;e|condary
<PB N="205" REF="216">Aid to the native Beauty of Virtue, would warm and cheri&s;h his native Goodne&s;s, and invigorate the Exertion of it. Accordingly <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> &s;oon drew the Eyes of all Men upon him; his Conduct was a con|&s;tant Emanation of Benevolence, and in his Bo&s;om glowed that inten&s;e heroic Ardour, which &s;oon after di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him in the Field of glorious Danger. In a &s;hort Time he arrived to the highe&s;t Degree of Popula|rity; the Sultan heaped Favours on him in what might be called a Profu&s;ion of Liberality, had not his Merit daily de&s;erved it from him. He was delegated with un|limited Authority to command the Armies of the Sul|tan, and from the Confines of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to the <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean, he &s;oon reduced every Thing under Subjection. Though he was yet green in Years, each Tongue was mute in his Pre&s;ence, and before him every Eye looked down with a Kind of reverential Awe; he loved the Prince, who rai&s;ed him to this State of Elevation, and by the Gentlene&s;s of his Manners he &s;oftened that Envy, which might otherwi&s;e ari&s;e again&s;t the Lu&s;tre of his Glory.</P>
<P>While <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> was con&s;tantly reaping fre&s;h Laurels, and gratifying his in&s;atiable Love of Fame by daily Ac|qui&s;itions of Glory, his Father at home met with a Rever&s;e of Fortune. <HI>Othman</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e Quali|ties, which &s;hone forth in his Son with a more &s;triking Lu&s;tre; and he vainly imagined, that in a corrupt de|generate Court, he could be great and good with Im|punity. But the Storm now gathered heavily in Clouds around him, and the turbulent Tempe&s;ts of Jealou&s;y, Ambition, Hatred, and Revenge environed him with a Whirlwind more dreadful than that which tears up whole Continents of Sand in the De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia.</HI> The grand Apartments in his Hou&s;e, which were for|merly filled with a Band of Courtiers, were now empty and forlorn; he was dive&s;ted of all his Honours; his Tru&s;t was taken away from him, and, after a Series
<PB N="206" REF="217">of Years &s;pent in the Service of his Prince, he was &s;tripped of every Thing but his paternal E&s;tate; whi|ther he withdrew to &s;helter him&s;elf from an ungrateful World.</P>
<P>In this Retirement, <HI>Othman,</HI> what were your Thoughts, what were your Sen&s;ations? The Sun u&s;hered in a Day void of Occupation, and the Night a Train of re&s;tle&s;s Dreams. At length his Con&s;titution received &s;uch &s;e|vere Strokes from a con&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion of corro&s;ive Cares, that he langui&s;hed under the Pre&s;&s;ure, and his Soul &s;ickened to De&s;peration. A gloomy vi&s;ionary Light ob&s;cured his Eyes with dim Suffu&s;ion, and he beheld with Joy the approaching Sun&s;et of his Days. As he lay langui&s;hing on the Bed of Sickne&s;s, he gave Orders, that his Son might be informed of his Situation. <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> immediately quitted his high Command, flew to his dying Father's languid Arms, and in a Gu&s;h of Tears embraced his agonizing Body. <HI>Othman,</HI> with what little Strength he had left, rai&s;ed his Head, and fixing his faded Eye-balls on him, "My Son, &s;aid he," hear my Words: <Q>You have beheld your Father in the Sun&s;hine of Pro&s;perity; you now behold him in the la&s;t Extreme of Mi&s;ery. I am fallen a Prey to the Intrigues of ill-de&s;igning Men;&mdash;the Angel of Death now hovers over his Victim; then li&s;ten to my la&s;t Directions;&mdash;Avoid pub|lic Honours;&mdash;fly from Courts, as from the Mon&s;ters of the De&s;art; be not mi&s;led by a vain Love of Fame and an unavailing Popularity;&mdash;Virtue is its own Reward;&mdash;then let your Happine&s;s be fixed in your own Mind, independent of external Objects;&mdash;de|&s;pi&s;e the Opinions of Mankind, which are always fluctuating and uncertain as the <HI>Ca&s;pian,</HI> when de|formed with Tempe&s;ts.&mdash;For the Remainder of your Days have a Contempt for Fame;&mdash;it will only lead you into a Series of Toils for an ungrate|ful World.&mdash;Steal through Life imperceptible, like
<PB N="207" REF="218">the Path of the Arrow, which leaves no Trace be|hind it;&mdash;let your Moderation &s;hade you from Envy, and look down upon the Giddy.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>He could no more; his Lot for Eternity was ca&s;t, and he expired. <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> wept in Bitterne&s;s of Angui&s;h over the be&s;t of Fathers; he trea&s;ured up his Precepts in the inmo&s;t Rece&s;&s;es of his Soul, and in&s;tantly began to conform his Conduct to the Practice of them. His Dignities and Honours he re&s;igned forthwith, and in the Sullenne&s;s of his Soul he locked him&s;elf from the World. His Hou&s;e no longer re&s;ounded with Singers and with Min&s;trels; no longer did Amber and Aloes admini&s;ter their rich Perfumes; the Va&s;es of Agate, which in his Father's Time overflowed with all the de|licious Liquors of the Ea&s;t, lay tumbled into an unre|garded Heap; and even the Hand of Charity, which was before &s;tretched out at his Gate, was now con|gealed and frozen up. Echo no longer repeated his Prai&s;es, and Scandal began to accumulate Di&s;grace upon him. This he heard, and he de&s;pi&s;ed the Rumour; the many Le&s;&s;ons given him by his Tutor were now totally forgot; the Seeds of Virtue lay dormant in his Brea&s;t, and his Love of Fame was now entirely extin|gui&s;hed, nay, the very Thoughts of it were loath&s;ome to him, in&s;omuch that, to leave no room for a Su&s;pi|cion that he had any the lea&s;t Regard for Popularity re|maining, he would often &s;ay to him&s;elf, <Q>That the World may &s;ee how much I am above any Notices it may take of me, I mu&s;t not be guilty of a &s;ingle good Action.</Q>&mdash;By imperceptible Degrees this Turn of Mind &s;ettled into a fixed In&s;en&s;ibility to all Dignity of Character, and on the Contempt of <HI>Fame</HI> was grafted a Contempt of <HI>Virtue.&mdash;Mu&s;tapha! Mu|&s;tapha!</HI> you thundered at the Head of Armies; whole Nations obeyed your Voice; and now, how altered! relaxed and enfeebled you groan in Angui&s;h, reluct|ant

<P>_WHILE <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> thus dozed away his Hours ingloriou&s;ly inactive, the Tidings of his Si|tuation were wafted abroad by every Breeze, and at length reached the Ears of <HI>Achmet</HI> in his Hermitage. The venerable old Man heard the Story with the &s;evere&s;t Compunction; his Heart was appalled within him; as if the Hand of Death had &s;mote him, he &s;at down in his Haram, but there no Angel whi&s;pered to his Meditation; no In&s;piration bore his Thoughts aloft to the prime Source of Being; <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI>'s Shame depre&s;&s;ed the Swellings of Enthu|&s;ia&s;m, and quite extingui&s;hed the pious Fervor of his Soul. He was tormented with the Reflection, that &s;o noble a Youth &s;hould &s;top &s;hort in the Middle of his Career, and check &s;uch excellent Propen&s;ities, as he knew were lodged in his Brea&s;t. At length he aro&s;e, and taking his Staff in his Hand, he extingui&s;hed the Light
<PB N="211" REF="222">which burned before him, and &s;et out on a Journey over the De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and in a &s;hort Time arrived at his Pupil's Habitation.</P>
<P>It was with Difficulty he gained Admi&s;&s;ion; but the Gates were no &s;ooner opened for him, than he went &s;treight to his young Pupil's Apartment. <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> was reclined upon a Sofa, his Looks &s;ullenly fixed on the Ground, and his Mind hardening into In&s;en&s;ibility. <HI>Achmet</HI> eagerly pre&s;ented him&s;elf before him. His Eyes were vivid and piercing, though the Quickne&s;s of their Lu&s;tre was &s;omewhat dimini&s;hed by the galling Effu&s;ion of Tears, which this unexpected Shock had co&s;t him. The Winter of Age had &s;hed its Snows upon his Head and Beard and the lively Expre&s;&s;ion of Pa&s;&s;ions, which throbbed in mingled Tumult about his Heart, rendered him an alarming Object to his Pupil. A con&s;cious Blu&s;h diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over his Face, at Sight of the hoary Sage; and both their Sen&s;ations being too big for Ut|terance, their Tongues were &s;u&s;pended, and their Eyes overflowing di&s;cour&s;ed for a while in the mo&s;t eloquent pathetic Silence. At length <HI>Achmet</HI> faintly uttered <HI>"Mu&s;tapha!"</HI> and a Gu&s;h of Tears choaked up the re&s;t. <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> at this was covered with Confu&s;ion, and at|tempted to break from him; but the pal&s;ied Nerves of the venerable Hermit felt a Renovation of Strength from the glowing Purpo&s;e of his Soul, and laying fa&s;t hold of his Pupil, he exclaimed, <Q>You &s;hall not put me from you; in me your Genius now alarms you; by me it means to rouze you from your Lethargy, and awaken the dying Embers of that amiable Fire, which formerly kindled all your Spirits, in tho&s;e happier Days, when my In&s;tructions were refre&s;hing to your Ears, as the Morning Dews to the Verdure, which cloaths the Fields of <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI> But now, how art thou fallen! each finer Principle of Virtue is &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, and you are even deaf to the Voice of Fame, that &s;weete&s;t Mu&s;ic to a virtuous Ear. But to re|deem
<PB N="212" REF="223">thee at once from the Dreams of Folly and over-weening Pride, in which thy Soul is now &s;lug|gi&s;hly immer&s;ed, read there that my&s;tic Truth, which a <HI>Genie</HI> put into my Hand, in an Hour of In&s;pira|tion, when my Thoughts were &s;welled with &s;ublime Ideas of the Di&s;pen&s;ations of him, who is in the Heaven of Heavens, and who&s;e wonder-working Hand launched forth the Planets into the illimitable Void, and &s;till continueth to produce the Harmony of the phy&s;ical and moral World by various Secrets and indirect Cau&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>The Heart of <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> was alarmed, and he read as follows. <Q>When VIRTUE was &s;ent down from the third Heaven to re&s;train the irregular Pa&s;&s;ions of Mankind, the Dignity of her Mien and Beauty of her A&s;pect were &s;ufficiently attractive to make her admired of all Beholders. But &s;uch is the Depravity of human Nature, that the&s;e Allurements &s;oon began to lo&s;e of their Influence, and VIRTUE &s;hortly finding her&s;elf neglected and forlorn, returned to her cele&s;tial Man&s;ion, in order to prefer her Complaint again&s;t the Sons of Men. There &s;he remon&s;trated, that blind Mankind was not only in&s;en&s;ible to her per&s;onal Charms, but al&s;o deaf to the Promi&s;e of Rewards, which were to be di&s;pen&s;ed to her Votaries in a future State of Exi&s;tence. Though this was a &s;ufficient Pro|vocation of Wrath, yet &s;uch was the &s;upreme Benevo|lence, that VIRTUE was again &s;ent down upon her Mi&s;&s;ion; and the better to &s;trengthen her Intere&s;ts, FAME was ordered to attend her, with an high Com|mi&s;&s;ion to di&s;pen&s;e temporary Retributions even on this Side of the Grave. As &s;oon as they reached the Verge of human Nature, FAME blew aloft her &s;ilver Trumpet, and an in&s;tantaneous Glow was kindled in all Hearts. Wherever VIRTUE was cheri&s;hed, FAME pur&s;ued her Foot&s;teps; and if Court was any where made to her alone, &s;he was &s;ure to withold her Fa|vours,
<PB N="213" REF="224">until the Candidates found Means, by the Re|commendation of VIRTUE, to in&s;inuate them&s;elves in|to her good Graces. By this amiable Union Mankind were re&s;trained within ju&s;t Re&s;trictions, and were ex|cited to a Series of meritorious Actions, either by an Attachment to the Allurements of VIRTUE, or from a De&s;ire of obtaining the Applau&s;e of FAME. But &s;hort is the Duration of all &s;ublunary Things. FAME, in her Turn, began to &s;hare the &s;ame Fate, that VIR|TUE had met before her; the Appetites of Men were now well-nigh &s;ated, and the Mu&s;ick of Applau&s;e no longer &s;ounded grateful to the Ear. It was ob&s;erva|ble that wherever &s;he met with a Repul&s;e, VIRTUE was &s;oon known to follow her, and it very rarely happened that &s;he remained with above one or two in an Age without her Attendant FAME. In Pro|ce&s;s of Time Matters were carried to that Extremity, that this cele&s;tial Pair were tired of their Pilgrimage, and wearied out at length they re&s;olved to offer up a joint Petition to be recalled. They therefore flew to the Throne of him who is in the Heaven of Heavens, and humbly urged, that it was in vain for them to &s;ojourn any longer upon Earth, as deluded Mankind was now entirely &s;educed by the &s;purious Ornaments of the Mon&s;ter VICE, which had i&s;&s;ued out of the Regions of Darkne&s;s, and &s;et up in Op|po&s;ition to all that VIRTUE and FAIR FAME could in&s;pire. In this In&s;tance again the tender Care of Heaven was eminently di&s;played, and the&s;e two radiant Beings were a &s;econd Time commanded to return to Earth, with Directions, that, however de|praved the Appetites of Men might be, they &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in an unremitted Cour&s;e of Endeavours for their Service. But the more effectually to &s;trengthen their Cau&s;e, a Fiend called INFAMY was ordered to i&s;&s;ue forth from the unhallowed Cell of VICE, and to adhere clo&s;e to her, what&s;oever Way &s;he &s;hould bend her Cour&s;e.
<PB N="214" REF="225">It was likewi&s;e ordained that whoever &s;hould betray a Di&s;regard for VIRTUE and HONEST FAME, &s;hould be branded by INFAMY, and that the&s;e two &s;hould thus continue to wander among Mankind, until the Angel of Death &s;hould walk forth by the Command of the ALMIGHTY, and &s;weep the whole Race from the Face of the Earth, to receive that Retribution of Rewards and Puni&s;hments, which may be due to their VIRTUE or VICE.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> now perceived the Mi&s;ts of Error clearing away from before his Under&s;tanding; he embraced <HI>Achmet,</HI> and poured out the Effu&s;ions of his Gratitude for thus recalling him to the Ta&s;k of Virtue, who&s;e Strength con&s;i&s;ts in Activity. He acknowledged that the Tran&s;ition is ea&s;y from a Contempt of Fame to an equal Di&s;regard for the Virtues that de&s;erve it; and the Name of <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> during the Remainder of the Chro|nicles of this Reign makes a di&s;tingui&s;hed Figure, and it is &s;aid that he clo&s;ed a Life of VIRTUE with Honour and Renown.</P>

<P>_IT occurred to me the other Day, as I was &s;itting in my Study, that I had contracted a very heavy Debt, on the Score of Vi&s;it|ing; and being willing to di&s;charge the Demands upon me as expeditiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible. I deter|mined to dedicate an entire Evening to the Settlement of this Account. I accordingly writ my Name upon about fifteen Pieces of Card, and fallied out upon this important Bu&s;ine&s;s. At mo&s;t of the Places, where I
<PB N="216" REF="227">called, I had no Occa&s;ion to alight, but di&s;charged my Obligation, by delivering to the Footman at the Door one of the Tokens of modern Friend&s;hip above men|tion'd; I had, however, the good Fortune of finding &s;ome of my <HI>Friends</HI> at home, who received me with prodigious Affability; and after de&s;iring mine, and giving me their Opinion of the important Di&s;putes concerning <HI>Elizabeth Canning</HI> and <HI>Mary Squires,</HI> di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed me with great Politene&s;s.</P>
<P>I was not a little fatigued with the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Repeti|tion of the &s;ame flimzy Chit-chat in every Company where I was admitted, and quite di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;o trifling a Manner of &s;pending my Time, I was ju&s;t going to direct the Coachman to drive home, when I recol|lected, that I had not &s;een my Friend Mr. <HI>Di&s;count</HI> of <HI>Cateaton-&s;treet,</HI> &s;ince the Lord Mayor's Day.</P>
<P>This determined me to &s;teer my Cour&s;e towards the City, and my good Genius prevailed &s;o far, that I found Mr. <HI>Di&s;count,</HI> his Lady and two Daughters, at home; it being the Day, upon which Mrs. <HI>Di&s;count</HI> &s;aw Company.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I entered the Room, my old Acquaint|ance &s;aluted me in a friendly Manner, and a&s;&s;ured me, that he was glad to &s;ee me; his Lady, in an ironical Compliment, delivered with a forced Smile, gave me to under&s;tand, that &s;he was highly &s;en&s;ible of the Ho|nour I did her Family, in conde&s;cending to come into the City; and the young Ladi&egrave;s curte&s;ied, and told me, with &s;ome Appearance of Re&s;entment, that they were extremely glad to find, that Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> had not entirely forgot his old Friends.</P>
<P>This Reception &s;omewhat di&s;concerted me; however, I endeavoured to acquit my&s;elf with the u&s;ual Compli|ments, &s;uch as&mdash;<HI>That I had the greate&s;t E&s;teem for Mr.</HI> Di&s;count<HI>'s Family&mdash;That Nobody re&s;pected them more&mdash;But that Affairs of Bu&s;ine&s;s had engro&s;&s;ed my Time&mdash;That I &s;eldom could command an Hour to my|&s;elf
<PB N="217" REF="228">&mdash;But that I certainly &s;hould not be &s;o had a Vi&s;iter for the futurs.</HI>&mdash;As &s;oon as this preliminary Point was &s;ettled, Mr. <HI>Di&s;count</HI> &s;eated me next him&s;elf, and turn|ing about, a&s;ked me, <Q>How Things went at our End of the Town?</Q>&mdash;<Q>What, &s;ays he, &s;hall we have a Lottery, do you think?</Q> I was going to an&s;wer, that I really was not in the Secret of tho&s;e Schemes, when the elde&s;t Mi&s;s <HI>Di&s;count</HI> interpo&s;ed, and &s;aid, <Q>Lord! Papa, do you imagine, that Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> trou|bles him&s;elf about the Things you talk of in your City Coffee-hou&s;es? What are your Money-Affairs to him?&mdash;Have you been at a great many Plays la&s;t Winter, Mr. <HI>Ranger?</HI>&mdash;What do you think of <HI>Foote</HI>'s Farce? I &s;aw it the fir&s;t Night&mdash;I would not mi&s;s it the fir&s;t Night for any Thing.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>As I was meditating an An&s;wer, my worthy Friend takes me by the Hand, and exclaims&mdash;<Q>Heavens! Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> what will this World come to! The young People of this Age, Sir, think of nothing but Diver&s;ions &mdash; From Morning to Night, my Ears, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> are dinned with <HI>Garrick</HI> and <HI>Barry,</HI> and Dogs and Monkeys, and <HI>Mother Midnight,</HI> and <HI>Spoona|ti&s;&s;imo,</HI> and &s;uch a Jargon, that one would imagine the Order of Things was inverted</Q> &mdash; Here the younge&s;t Mi&s;s <HI>Di&s;count</HI> &s;eized the Conver&s;ation &mdash; <Q>Nay, now, Papa, &s;ays &s;he, becau&s;e you do not go to tho&s;e Places your&s;elf, you would not have any Body el&s;e go</Q>&mdash;<Q>That's true <HI>Betty,</HI> replied Mamma: He is a &s;trange Man, to be &s;ure &mdash; Mr. <HI>Di&s;count</HI> has no Notion of any Thing genteel &mdash; Well, he mu&s;t have his own Way.</Q> &mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Di&s;count,</HI> without taking Notice of the&s;e Inter|raptions, re&s;umed his Di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;<Q>Why, Sir, &s;ays he, this mu&s;t portend &s;omething&mdash;Certainly a Judgment hangs over the Nation&mdash;We &s;hall un|doubtedly have another Earthquake at lea&s;t&mdash;You know, the la&s;t Earthquake was occa&s;ioned by the

<Q><L>Seldom your Opinions err,</L>
<L>Your Eyes are always in the right.</L></Q> This Topic had, I thought, been pur&s;ued rather too far, therefore, I waved the Conver&s;ation, and a&s;ked the Ladies, whether they had &s;een Mrs. <HI>Brillant,</HI> &s;ince her Marriage? To this they all an&s;wered at once, O yes&mdash;Whereupon I took the Liberty to addre&s;s my|&s;elf particularly to Mrs. <HI>Di&s;count,</HI> and de&s;ired to know,
<PB N="219" REF="230">whether &s;he did not think her a very fine Woman?&mdash; <Q>A fine Woman, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> replied &s;he, how can you a&s;k me &s;uch a Que&s;tion? To be &s;ure, &s;he is a &s;howy Woman, and &s;uch a one as takes with the Men; but you can't call her a fine Woman &s;urely. &mdash;Then, &s;he wears her Cap &s;o horridly; and al|ways overdre&s;&s;es her&s;elf&mdash;The Gentlemen, I know, admire her, but I prote&s;t I cannot &s;ee for what."&mdash; Madam, replied I, I mu&s;t beg Leave to be of a dif|ferent Opinion; in my Eyes, Mrs. <HI>Brillant</HI> appears a very amiable Woman, and it gives me a great deal of Plea&s;ure, that &s;he is &s;o happily married."&mdash; O indeed, &s;ays Mi&s;s <HI>Di&s;count,</HI> I believe &s;he is very happy, for &s;he has a very hand&s;ome Equipage, and a &s;weet Pair of Ear-rings; and then &s;he &s;ees a va&s;t deal of Company&mdash;There were ninety Per&s;ons at her la&s;t Rout&mdash;She plays Crown-Whi&s;t</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>I could not forbear ob&s;erving, that I was a little &s;ur|prized, &s;o di&s;cerning a young Lady &s;hould e&s;timate Mrs. <HI>Brillant</HI>'s Happine&s;s from the Stake &s;he played for at Whi&s;t, when to me it appeared, that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a a more certain Source of Felicity, in the amiable Qua|lities and polite Accompli&s;hments of her Hu&s;band&mdash; <Q>O law! that's true, replied the Ladies, they &s;ay her Hu&s;band too is a <HI>pretty Man.</HI></Q></P>
<P>We were proceeding farther on this Head, when a thundering Rap was given at the Door, and the Ser|vant &s;ignified, that Lady <HI>Port&s;oken</HI> was coming into the Room. As I thought I had paid a Vi&s;it of a &s;ufficient Length, I took Advantage of the Alarm given by this City Knight's Lady, and withdrew unnoticed.</P>
<P>In my return Home, I could not avoid reflecting on the capricious Notions the female World entertain of Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>To be dre&s;&s;ed as well as others of the &s;ame Rank; to be pre&s;ent at all public Places, without con&s;idering the Entertainment in any other Light, than as the Means
<PB N="220" REF="231">of bringing Company together; to vi&s;it, and be vi&s;ited by every one, whom they think it of Con&s;equence to &s;alute at the Playhou&s;e; to live (if it may be called liv|ing) in a perpetual Cour&s;e of Card-playing; and, to &s;um up the whole, to be married to a Man of any Age, Figure or Qualities what&s;oever, capable and willing to &s;upport all this, in the Opinion of Ninety-nine Females in a Hundred, con&s;titutes a happy Woman. I &s;hould be perhaps cen&s;ured as a Pedant, if I offended the De|licacy of my female Readers, with ob&s;erving, that they degrade the Faculties of the human Soul, by confining the Exerci&s;e of them within &s;uch a Circle of Trifles; but I hope I may be allowed Leave to refer them to the <HI>Spectator,</HI> where they will learn from the elegant Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> that the &s;tronge&s;t Argument, which can be advanced for the Immortality of the Soul, is, the con|tinual Progre&s;s of the Mind in the Acqui&s;ition of Know|ledge.</P>
<P>Now, I would &s;ubmit it to the Candor of my fair Countrywomen, whether their Conduct does not &s;ubvert the Principles, upon which this polite Philo&s;opher Rea&s;ons; and tend to e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Doc|trine, that the Souls of Women are mortal.</P>
<P>Should this <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Tenet ever prevail among us, dreadful will be the Con&s;equences. How will it be po&s;|&s;ible for an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lady to content her&s;elf with the fourth Part of a Hu&s;band? And what a melancholy Tran&s;ition will it be, from the Liberties at pre&s;ent in|dalged to <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Wives, to the Confinement and Hor|rors of a Seraglio?&mdash;</P>
<P>I could add much more on this Subject, but I am aware, that my pretty Readers are prepared with a con|clu&s;ive An&s;wer to whatever can be advanced&mdash;<HI>Well; you may &s;ay what you will, but People will do as they like, for all that</HI>&mdash;The Force of which I readily acknow|ledge, and, as becomes me, lay by the Pen.</P>

<L>Urbem, quam &s;tatuo, ve&s;tra e&s;t.&mdash;</L>
<BIBL><HI>VIRG:</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_I HAVE of late received &s;everal very ur|gent Letters from my Corre&s;pondents, in which they &s;trenuou&s;ly pre&s;s me into the Service of my Country; and though I have always di&s;claimed Politics, as a Subject aver&s;e from my Inclinations, the&s;e Gentlemen are for making a State&s;|man of me in my own De&s;pite. I mu&s;t own, I am not willing to be thrown off my Bya&s;s, but when the Act of Parliament in favour of the <HI>Jews</HI> engro&s;&s;es &s;o much of our Conver&s;ation, and has worked all our Spi|rits into a Ferment, it then becomes the Duty of a Pub|lick Writer, to make his Bow to the Mu&s;es, and devote one Lucubration to the Happine&s;s and Welfare of his Countrymen.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have naturally interwoven in their Con|&s;titution a peculiar Kind of national Self-Love, and the lea&s;t Attempt to di&s;pen&s;e a Favour to Foreigners a|larms their Fears, and awakens that Jealou&s;y which is natural to their very Frame. It is to this we owe the general Di&s;content, which has broke out among all Ranks of People upon the late Occa&s;ion; but that it is owing to a mi&s;taken Prejudice, I believe, will be manife&s;t to any Man that does not &s;ee Things with the Jaundiced Fye of Party.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that by this Act we give the Lie to the Scripture, and fly in the Face of a peremptory Pro|phecy,
<PB N="223" REF="234">which declares, that the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;hould be with|out a fixed Scttlement in any Country, a vagabond Race upon the Face of the Earth. There was a Time when this Objection might be allowed to carry with it &s;ome Degree of Weight; while Chri&s;tianity &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in this Kingdom, it would have been the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Ab&s;urdity to introduce a Bill of this Nature.</P>
<P>But the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation has entirely di&s;ap|peared from among us, and I believe, in the Memory of the olde&s;t Per&s;on now living no Trace of it can be found; which is, in my Opinion, a conclu&s;ive Argu|ment in Favour of this Naturalization Act. Were it any Way incon&s;i&s;tent with the Religion now in Fa&s;hion, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, it would have met with Oppo&s;ition from a certain Bench in the H &mdash; of L &mdash;; but as nothing of this Kind was offered, it is to be pre&s;umed, that Judai&s;m properly coincides with our pre&s;ent Di&s;|po&s;ition both in Church and State; and I would there|fore recommend this Doctrine to be preached from the Pulpit, for the better quieting the Minds of Men; and if the Right Reverends would i&s;&s;ue out Pa&s;toral Let|ters to this Purpo&s;e, the Remedy would be quicker in its Operation, and the mi&s;taken Notions, which the common People have imbibed, would the &s;ooner be effaced.</P>
<P>About three Weeks &s;ince I had Occa&s;ion to take a Boat at <HI>Whitehall</HI> Stairs, in order to go a little Way down the River. We no &s;ooner put off from Shore, than I perceived the Waterman to be a very &s;en&s;ible Fellow, and particularly knowing in Politics. I there|fore gave him an Opportunity of di&s;covering his Senti|ments on the Bill in Que&s;tion, and he di&s;cu&s;&s;ed it with great Strength of Lungs, and Vehemence of Ob&s;erva|tion, <Q>D&mdash;mn the circumci&s;ed Dogs, &s;ays he, now they are naturalized, I'll engage we &s;hall have them all turn Watermen, and they will have all the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the River to them&s;elves.</Q>&mdash;This Story (which
<PB N="224" REF="235">is really a Matter of Fact) will &s;hew what Prejudices are entertained by the common People, who have rai&s;ed the violent Clamour again&s;t the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> on this Occa|&s;ion; and hence may be inferred that Wi&s;dom doth not always cry out in the Streets. For my Part, I am per&s;uaded, when Things are con&s;idered di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately, the Act will bear a different A&s;pect in the Eyes of all Men of Sen&s;e. For who have been &s;erved by it? Not the poor <HI>Jews,</HI> who are &s;till le&s;t under the Severity de|nounced again&s;t them, but the rich, who are by this Stroke re&s;cued from Heaven's Vengeance; and this Regard to the Affluent, and Contempt for the Money|le&s;s, I take to be perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the Genius of a trading Nation; and I am of Opinion that from this Incident, a very u&s;eful Moral may be enforced, <HI>viz.</HI> that Money cannot only influence &s;ublunary Things, but al&s;o &s;uper&s;ede the Decrees of Providence; and as I think this Act has given the Nation in general a very great Acce&s;&s;ion of Credit, Reputation, Honour, and Riches, I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee a further Step taken, in order to render the Work complete. I have not had Time to dige&s;t my Thoughts into a regular Scheme, and &s;hall therefore content my&s;elf to &s;ugge&s;t a few Hints, which may be improved at Maturity.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As it is apparent from what has been ob|&s;erved already, that the Chri&s;tian Religion has no longer a Footing in this Country, it may not be improper to repeal the &s;acramental Te&s;t, and to &s;ub&s;titute in its Room the Act of Circumci&s;ion; for which Purpo&s;e pro|per Circumci&s;ers may be found in <HI>Duke's-Place,</HI> who &s;hall perform the Operation upon all our Placemen; and a proper Number may be cho&s;en out of a certain venerable Body, in the Nature of a Jury of Matrons, to examine whether the Per&s;on be qualified according to Law.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As the <HI>Jews</HI> are known to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of over-grown Riches, and as no Lottery can be vigorou&s;ly carried on without their Concurrence, whenever Sir
<PB N="225" REF="236"><HI>John Barnard,</HI> or any Patriot inclinable to Chri&s;tianity, &s;hall devi&s;e a Scheme to prevent Impo&s;itions from Stock-Jobbers, it will be advi&s;eable to let nobody into the Sub&s;cription but the above-mentioned <HI>Jews,</HI> who certainly cannot grow too rich, as our Regard for them will increa&s;e in Proportion to their Pelf.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I am of Opinion, that it is prejudicial to this Kingdom to exclude the &s;aid <HI>Jews</HI> from Employments Civil and Military, becau&s;e, as they have no other Coun|try of their own, it is highly probable, that they will love <HI>England,</HI> (or <HI>Judaea Nova</HI>) with an Exce&s;s of Zeal; and if they were appointed to &s;upply our Army and Navy with Provi&s;ions upon all Emergencies, it will cer|tainly be perfectly agreeable to the Ta&s;te of our Sol|diery and our Mariners to be fed with Beef cured by a <HI>Jew</HI> Butcher. Aboard the Fleet particularly, it will in|fallibly be plea&s;ing to have a Me&s;s of Beef with a Label of &s;tamped Lead upon it, to convince the Men that it has been duly cured. And further, in&s;tead of making Men of Merit Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> or promoting them to &s;uch like Honours, &s;uppo&s;e they were to be di&s;tingui&s;hed (<HI>Secundum ordinem Melchizedec,</HI>) by the Or|der of <HI>Melchizedec,</HI> it would not be an improper In&s;titu|tion. But this I &s;ubmit to better Judgments.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI> and <HI>La&s;tly,</HI>&mdash; I humbly propo&s;e, that an Army may be &s;peedily rai&s;ed for the Retaking <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI> which happy Event would enable our good Friends and now Countrymen the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> to rebuild their Temple; by which Means they would entirely over|turn the only Ob&s;tacle which now remains, towards di&s;&s;ipating tho&s;e Errors, which have mi&s;guided People the&s;e &s;eventeen Hundred fifty three Years pa&s;t. And I hope, the bad Succe&s;s of that great Man <HI>Julian the Apo|&s;tate,</HI> who was defeated, by the Interpo&s;ition of Heaven, in an Attempt of this Kind, will be no Di&s;courage|ment.</P>

<P>_THERE is nothing more common than to hear it deci&s;ively pronounced in Conver&s;a|tion, that Mr. <HI>Such-a-one</HI> is a Man of very good Sen&s;e; or, on the Rever&s;e, that he has not common Sen&s;e; and yet, notwith&s;tanding the frequent U&s;age of this Phra&s;e, I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e upon me to &s;ay, there is not a Term in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language &s;o little under&s;tood, or made u&s;e of in &s;o many vague-Sig|nifications. The Cau&s;e of this Variety of Conception is to be imputed to the various Lot of human Life, in which mo&s;t People derive their Stock of Ideas from the Occupation they have been accidentally thrown into; from whence they acquire &s;uch confined Habits of thinking, that they have no Power of Reflection out of the beaten Path, and mo&s;t Things are by them deter|mined,
<PB N="228" REF="239">according to their partial Survey of Men and Manners.</P>
<P>I have &s;omewhere read of a People re&s;iding in a &s;mall Town, &s;ituate in the Mid&s;t of the <HI>Alps,</HI> with whom the principal Con&s;tituent of Beauty is a &s;welling Prominence of Fle&s;h in the Throat, by them called a <HI>Gother;</HI> and it is recorded, that, when when an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman, remarkable for all the Graces of manly Beauty, was pa&s;&s;ing by on his Travels to <HI>Italy,</HI> the&s;e Virtuo&s;os ob&s;erved, that he was of an elegant Form, and would really be very hand&s;ome, if had but a <HI>Gother.</HI> In like Manner, we daily meet with as notable Opinions relating to the Intellects of our Neighbours. I remem|ber my&s;elf to have heard a Per&s;on of excellent Parts condemned for a Blockhead, becau&s;e he never won an odd Trick at Whi&s;t; and I have known another ac|counted a Man of the be&s;t Sen&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e he was a great Dab at the Multipllcation Table, and had got over <HI>Euclid's Pons A&s;inorum.</HI> A Knack of Rhyming hath given an Air of Importance to a Ver&s;e maker, and the Acquirement of a Fortune is a Rule from which there can be no Appeal. Some Degree of Luck in this Way is &s;ufficent to dub any one, SENSIBLE, WITTY, POLITE, GOOD-NATURED, and what not? Riches be|ing in this In&s;tance like Tar-water, not only &s;erving as an excellent Alterative again&s;t all noxious Particles in the Con&s;titution, but al&s;o conferring every good Qua|lity under the Sun. It is to this Principle that we owe the EMINENT Chee&s;emonger, the EMINENT Tallow-Chandler, the EMINENT Haberda&s;her of Small-ware, the EMINENT Needlemaker, the EMINENT Pawnbroker, and a thou&s;and other Degrees of EMINENCE, which it would be too tedious to enumerate at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>There is a Pa&s;&s;age in the Characters of the famous <HI>La Bruyere,</HI> which it may not be improper to cite on the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion. <Q>FAUSTE <HI>e&s;t un di&s;&s;olu, un prodigue, un libertin, un ingrat, un emport&eacute;, qu'</HI>AURELE <HI>&s;on oncle
<PB N="229" REF="240">n'a pu hair ni de&s;heriter.</HI> FRONTIN, <HI>neveu d'</HI>AURELE, <HI>apr&egrave;s vingt aitn&eacute;es d'une probit&eacute; connue, &amp; d'une complai|&s;ance aveugle pour ce vieillard, ne l'a pu flechir en &s;a faveur; &amp; ne tire de &s;a depouille qu'une legere Pen&s;ion, que</HI> FAUSTE <HI>unique legataire lui doit payer.</HI>" "<HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> &s;ays the great Writer ju&s;t mentioned, is di&s;&s;olute in his Man|ners, profu&s;e in his Expences, a Libertine, an Ingrate, a Slave to his Pa&s;&s;ions, and yet his Uncle <HI>Aurelius</HI> could never conceive a Di&s;like to him, nor di&s;inherit him in his Will. <HI>Frontinus,</HI> Nephew to <HI>Aurelius,</HI> has given Proofs of his Probity and re&s;pectful Attention to the old Gentleman, during a Series of twenty Years, and yet never could impre&s;s upon his Mind one Sen|timent in his Favour; and now he lives upon a &s;canty Annuity, which is paid to him by <HI>Fau&s;ius,</HI> &s;ole Le|gatee to <HI>Aurelius.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This Extract, I apprehend, may &s;erve to convince the Reader, that Fortune is but an erroneous Rule, by which to judge of a Character. As I conceive it, the Term <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> is derived from the Organs of bodily Sen&s;ation, which, when in due Order, give to the Mind an immediate Information of the Qualities in|herent in natural Bodies; from thence the Phra&s;e is trans&s;ferred to the human Mind, and denotes a quick Power of Perception in the Under&s;tanding upon all Oc|currences in Life. Were I to define a Man of Sen&s;e, I &s;hould call him a Per&s;on of clear Apprehen&s;ion and &s;ound Judgment; Talents, which a &s;mall Degree of Ob&s;ervation will convince us, many are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, though they do not upon all Occa&s;ions avail them&s;elves of them; but, on the contrary, let them lie dormant in their Minds, without calling them forth into Action. The late Sir <HI>Richard Steel,</HI> I believe, may be allowed to have enjoyed as &s;trong Intellectuals as any Cit what|ever, and yet in pecuniary Matters his Conduct was highly negligent. It is &s;aid of this Gentleman, that going one Day into his Chariot, with an intimate
<PB N="230" REF="241">Friend, whom he had invited to his Country-Hou&s;e, as he pa&s;&s;ed through a Lane of his Servants, who had drawn them&s;elves up in the Hall, the humorous Knight, looking over his Shoulder at his Acquaintance, plea|&s;antly repeated from <HI>Horace,</HI>
<Q><HI>Mancipiis locuples eget aeris Cappadocum Rex.</HI></Q>
<Q>The King of <HI>Cappadocia</HI> is well provided with Ser|vants, but wants Money.</Q> From this it will appear, what Degree of Regard that Genius had for yellow Dirt, which, though a Nece&s;&s;ary of Life, is certainly incapable of conferring one &s;ingle Accompli&s;hment either to the Head or Heart, and is generally the Acqui&s;ition of the Dulle&s;t of human Race.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that to create a Fortune in the ordinary Paths of Bu&s;ine&s;s, is &s;o far from requiring Wit, Genius, Learning, Imagination, Invention, or any liberal Fa|culty, that every one of tho&s;e Attributes have rather a Tendency to keep the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of them &s;till the poorer, "as Heaven's ble&s;t Beams turns Vinegar more &s;our." An eager Love of Pelf, a narrow Attention to what is called the main Chance, a Spice of that Clergyman's Way of thinking who delivered in his Sermon that "a Shilling is a &s;erious Thing," and a cold, languid, unimpa&s;&s;ioned Temper, are the principal Ingredients in the Compo&s;ition of the Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s; while Per|&s;ons of quick Under&s;tanding will always have lively Sen&s;ations, which mu&s;t, at Times, hurry them in|to Scenes of Action a&s;toni&s;hing to the &s;ober Shop|keeper, or the &s;edate Book-keeper; but it &s;hould be remembered, that Pa&s;&s;ions are the Gales of Life, and that to be dive&s;ted of them, is &s;o far from denoting a &s;en&s;ible Mind, that it is a Proof of lamentable Dullne&s;s
<PB N="231" REF="242">and Stupidity. I &s;hall conclude this Paper with two &s;hort Characters drawn from real Life.</P>
<P><HI>Avarus</HI> was bound to a Trade at fourteen. Years of Age; he cleaned his Ma&s;ter's Shoes, laid under the Counter, &s;wept the Shop, &s;craped the Thre&s;hold, mount|ed on the Leads to clean the Gutter, went regularly to the Po&s;t-Office with Letters, was perfectly well ver&s;ed in the Rule of Three, and had the Merchant's Direc|tory by Heart. On <HI>Sundays</HI> he would take a &s;ober Walk to <HI>I&s;lington, Newington, Paddington,</HI> &amp;c. and, when a Frolic &s;eized him, he would, in the Fulne&s;s of his Soul, &s;pend his Threepence at <HI>Jenny</HI>'s <HI>Whim.</HI> As he grew up, he became a downright <HI>Stoic</HI> in the Government of his Pa&s;&s;ions, to &s;uch a Degree, that he was thought at length totally to have extingui&s;hed them all, except his darling Love of Money, which has never cea&s;ed to influence his Thoughts. In &s;hort, <HI>Avarus</HI> has been &s;o attentive to the main Chance, that he is now flouri&s;hing and &s;tarving with a large Fortune; is determined to &s;ell his Vote at the next Election, and is likely in Time to be made Sheriff of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Liberalis</HI> was bred at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> School, where he was always famous for a keen Turn at an Epigram, and, when removed to the Univer&s;ity, he was thought to have car|ried with him a great Knowledge of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI> While at <HI>Oxford</HI> he enlarged his Mind with u&s;eful Stu|dies, and cultivated a ju&s;t and elegant Ta&s;te for all po|lite Literature. Being turned of One and twenty, he entered him&s;elf in the <HI>Temple,</HI> where he read the Law with &s;ufficient Application; but, in order to unbend his Mind, he was frequently found dipping into <HI>Shake|&s;pear;</HI> and it has been &s;aid by his Enemies, that he never would entirely dive&s;t him&s;elf of an Attachment to the <HI>Belles Lettres.</HI> I have &s;omewhere &s;een it remarked, that a Ta&s;te in Reading is apt to infu&s;e the &s;ame in Morals; which Ob&s;ervation proved fatally true to <HI>Liberalis,</HI> and in Con&s;equence of this Turn of Mind, he could never
<PB N="232" REF="243">prevail on him&s;elf to fall into any mean Practices, by which Conduct he &s;oon found him&s;elf de&s;erted by his Clients, and neglected by the Attorneys; and he now remains un&s;ought in his Chambers, in the high Road to Poverty; in which, agreeably to the Way of the World, we will leave him to him&s;elf, and lay down the Pen.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_UPON going into the <HI>Bedford</HI> Coffee-hou&s;e a few Days &s;ince, I found my Friend <HI>Wild|air</HI> in a Circle of his Acquaintance; he was talking over the &s;everal Occurrences he had met with in his Rambles after Intelligence that Day; and, as he has a peculiar Dexterity in dre&s;&s;ing up a Story in all its mo&s;t &s;triking Colours, without falling into a tedious minute Detail of trivial Circum|&s;tances, he touched upon many Incidents in a Manner &s;o diverting, that he excited a general Mirth in the little Audience that was gathered round him. <HI>Wildair,</HI> to &s;peak the Truth, has &s;omething extremely captivating in his Conver&s;ation, and is, of all the Men I know, the be&s;t turned for Society. Though a Fellow of Parts, he has never &s;uffered his Spirits to &s;ub&s;ide into a &s;e|rious Habit of thinking, but, in a &s;uperficial Way, glides over every Thing that offers in Company; no Subject comes ami&s;s to him, and be it what it will, he has al|ways &s;omething to &s;ay for him&s;elf; which Circum&s;tance, joined to a &s;prightly Delivery, contributes greatly to enliven his Company. He frequently rallies a Gentle|man of our intimate Acquaintance on this Head, and will tell him frankly, <Q>I know, <HI>Jack,</HI> you are a &s;en|&s;ible Fellow in the main, but as you manage Mat|ters, your Friends mu&s;t &s;tudy hard to find it out;&mdash;
<PB N="234" REF="245">take my Word for it, the World is very &s;uperficial, and a Facility of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing every Subject in a bri&s;k Manner, will make a Per&s;on pa&s;s for a Knowing one, at the &s;ame Time that it renders him &s;ociable, and of cour&s;e agreeable.</Q></P>
<P>This is my worthy Friend <HI>Wildair</HI>'s Way of thinking, and upon this Plan he acquits him&s;elf &s;o well, that he is extremely &s;ought by his Acquaintance, and when|ever they lay hold of him, it is difficult for him to elude their Solicitations for a Party of Plea&s;ure. This was the Ca&s;e with him the other Night, and as I was pay|ing my Debt at the Bar, he made up to me, and with a Whi&s;per told me, That if I would make one of the Company, it would furni&s;h me with Hints for &s;ome future E&s;&s;ay. In vain I reminded him that it was Club Night, and his Turn to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Chair; this Party, he a&s;&s;ured me, would afford higher Entertain|ment. I yielded to his Sollicitations, and I mu&s;t &s;ay, that my Manner of &s;pending the Evening has &s;upplied me with Materials, the like of which never came in my Way before.</P>
<P>Before I proceed farther into the Bu&s;ine&s;s, it may not be improper, in Imitation of the Writers for the Stage, to give a Degree of In&s;ight into the Characters of the <HI>Dramatis Per&s;onae.</HI> The Reader is already ac|quainted with my Di&s;po&s;ition and Way of thinking, and he al&s;o knows Mr. <HI>Wildair.</HI> The re&s;t of the Com|pany con&s;i&s;ted of a MAN OF WIT, a MAN OF HUMOUR, a DAMN'D HONEST FELLOW, and a Per&s;on of a very elegant Appearance, a cool &s;edate Temper, and ex|tremely decent and polite in his Deportment. With this Set, I &s;hifted the Scene from the <HI>Bedford</HI> to the <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s-<HI>Head,</HI> and upon entering the Tavern, the HONEST FELLOW alarmed the Hou&s;e, by calling for a Room with great Vociferation; which being &s;hewed to us with the utmo&s;t Attention, he ordered a Brace of Bottles of the right Sort, immediately filled a Round
<PB N="235" REF="246">of Bumpers, and roared out, "Come let's be jolly, <HI>Ranger,</HI>"&mdash;"d&mdash;mn your mu&s;ty Books"&mdash;<Q>let's &s;it down.</Q>&mdash;This I had no Objection to; but as I was attempting to do it, the MAN OF HUMOUR, with infinite Plea&s;antry, removed the Chair that was placed for me; the Con&s;equence of which was, that, to the great Surprize of the whole Company, I was brought to the Ground. As I received a Contu&s;ion in the Fall, I could not entirely reli&s;h the Joke, but it gave infinite Satisfaction to almo&s;t all the re&s;t, and they agreed, that it really was a very good Thing, as good a Thing as ever they had known: "Immen&s;e, by G&mdash;d," &s;ays the HONEST FELLOW, "a glorious Hum," &s;ays the WIT; while my humorous Friend, with a dry Compo&s;ure of Countenance, denoting &s;omething between Je&s;t and Earne&s;t, begged my Pardon, and then officiou&s;ly offered to &s;ettle my Wig; and this he did in &s;uch a facetious Po|&s;ition, and &s;uch a whim&s;ical Stare of the Curls, that thence was deducible a new Flow of Mirth, which, amid&s;t the Bur&s;ts of Joy that &s;tunned my Ears, he enjoyed in a &s;ober Manner, Humour being ever grave and &s;edate. <HI>Wildair</HI> perceiving by this Time, that I did not approve my Com|pany, came over to me, and begged I would &s;ee it out, and &s;queezing my Hand, he added from <HI>Virgil,</HI>
<Q>For&s;an &amp; haec olim memini&s;&s;e juvabit.</Q></P>
<P>This had &s;o much Prevalence with me, that I agreed, and the HONEST FELLOW &s;hewed away egregiou&s;ly. The Bottle went round at &s;o bri&s;k a Rate, that my Eyes began to dance in my Head like Wild-fire. By all that's Burgundy, &s;ays he, <Q><HI>Harris</HI> is the be&s;t Pimp in <HI>England,</HI>&mdash;Here Waiter, call <HI>Harris (Enter Harris) &mdash;Harris,</HI> d&mdash;mn your old Soul, get us a fine Girl"&mdash;"There's a fine Girl plea&s;e your Honour at a Place I know,&mdash;no body has &s;een her but <HI>Lord Shallow,</HI> and my&s;elf&mdash;and there's <HI>Betty Connor,</HI>
<PB N="236" REF="247">ju&s;t arrived from <HI>Dublin</HI>&mdash;'Squire <HI>M'Hazard</HI> brought her with him; &s;he has fine Fle&s;h and Blood, plea&s;e your Honour,&mdash;mo&s;t of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Wenches have, plea&s;e your Honour,&mdash;and if your Honour chu&s;es it, I fancy I have a Bait will bring her out.</Q>&mdash; This Propo&s;al was univer&s;ally received, and in a &s;hort Time the Lady was u&s;hered into the Room, not with|out &s;ome Glances mutually interchanged between her and <HI>Harris.</HI></P>
<P>The MAN OF HUMOUR and the WIT immediately began to play her off, as they called it&mdash;But, as it is a Rule among good Writers, never to enlarge too much upon any Subject, and to leave &s;omething for the Imagination of the Reader to &s;upply, I &s;hall upon this Occa&s;ion conform to the Precept; and will only add, that the Lady, in the Space of about half an Hour, drank and &s;ung, and laughed and cried, and danced and &s;at, and talked and &s;aid nothing, with the mo&s;t &s;ur|prizing Quickne&s;s in the Vici&s;&s;itude, till at length, the HONEST FELLOW &s;wore that &s;he &s;poiled good Fellow|&s;hip, and-abruptly de&s;ired her to take half a Guinea at the Bar and withdraw, which Madam performed after &s;everal Te hes and Titters.</P>
<P>This Matter being &s;ettled, we were &s;uddenly &s;urprized with the mo&s;t enlivening Melody, accompanied by a &s;prightly Voice, that plainly and mu&s;ically articulated, <HI>Non, toujours dire non, &amp;c.</HI> It &s;eems, one of tho&s;e fair Natives of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who are good-natured enough to un|dergo the Fatigue of a long Journey, in order to make our Public Streets harmonious, was placed in the Yard, with private In&s;tructions to entertain us with the vocal and in&s;trumental Strain. By this our Spirits received a fre&s;h Reinforcement, and the MAN OF WIT immediately threw his Wig out of the Window, bounced over the Table, broke &s;everal Bottles and Gla&s;&s;es, and alarmed me with a mo&s;t intolerable Rap on the Shoulders. The
<PB N="237" REF="248">MAN OF HUMOUR expre&s;&s;ed his Approbation with a dry Joke; the HONEST FELLOW pu&s;hed the <HI>Burgundy</HI> about, and the decent Gentleman, whom the Reader will recollect I mentioned in the Beginning of this Paper, &s;miled with the mo&s;t winning Complacence. This Per&s;onage has hitherto made no Figure in this <HI>Sympo&s;ium;</HI> the Fact is, he did not drink above &s;ix Gla&s;&s;es of Wine during the whole Night; but now his Heart &s;eemed to dilate, his Eyes &s;parkled with the mo&s;t vivid Lu&s;tre, and in the Chearfulne&s;s of his Soul, he held out his Fi&s;t to the Company, and, <Q>Come, &s;ays he, Odd or Even for this little Silver.</Q> The Spirits of almo&s;t every one pre&s;ent were ready to flow into any Channel, and Gaming became the general Amu&s;ement. Cards were immediately rung for to play at Brag, and after a few Rounds, the ELEGANT POLITE MAN pro|duced a Box and Dice out of his Pocket, and I believe he will hardly forgive me for de&s;iring a Bill at Five in the Morning, as he was in a tolerable Run, and had picked up about &s;eventy Pounds. However, with &s;ome Reluctance, he conde&s;cended to collect the Reckon|ing, which, as &s;oon as every Body paid his Proportion, he carefully put into his Pocket, and de&s;ired his Friend <HI>Tomkyns</HI> to place the whole to his Account.</P>
<P>This being adju&s;ted, in order to compleat this Even|ing the MAN OF HUMOUR propo&s;ed a Scheme, which, he &s;aid, would afford more Plea&s;antry than he had ever known. <Q>It-is, &s;ays he, the luckie&s;t Thought in the World&mdash;a better&mdash;ne&mdash;never&mdash;enter &mdash;ed&mdash;into a&mdash;Man's&mdash;He&mdash;ad&mdash;let us tofs up, who &s;hall&mdash;be&mdash;th&mdash;thrown&mdash;out of&mdash;the Window, for the frol&mdash;frolick &s;ake.</Q>&mdash;I was very much aver&s;e from this Piece of Merriment, but being over-ruled by the Company, it was immediately done, and the Lot fell to my Friend <HI>Wildair,</HI> who was in&s;tantly &s;urrounded, and the HONEST FELLOW opened the Window, not without violent Roaring, while the
<PB N="238" REF="249">DECENT MAN &s;till continued at the Table, throwing the Dice, and &s;aying to him&s;elf, "Seven's the Main." I really believe, the Coroner's Inque&s;t would have &s;at on <HI>Wildair</HI>'s Body at Ten o'Clock in the Morning, had not the timely Interpo&s;ition of &s;ober Entreaty begged him off.</P>
<P>Upon this I made my E&s;cape, and I do not know when I &s;pent an Evening in a Manner that has given me &s;uch Reflections. The MAN OF WIT, I &s;uppo&s;e, has acquired his Notions of Things from Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore,</HI> who tells us, that Wit con&s;i&s;ts in regular and exalted Ferments; or from Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> who defines it, a Motion of furious Joy and Pride of Soul upon Con|ception of an Hint; for indeed, this Gentleman has certainly very exalted Ferments, and mo&s;t &s;urprizing Motions upon the Conception of his Hints. I &s;hall take Occa&s;ion in &s;ome en&s;uing E&s;&s;ay, to undeceive him, by giving the Ideas I have formed to my&s;elf of the Talent he profe&s;&s;es; and in my next Lucubration I &s;hall endeavour to convince the MAN OF HUMOUR, that he is wide of the Character he would be thought to po&s;&s;e&s;s. As HUMOUR is a Subject of &s;ome Diffi|culty, I &s;hall endeavour to treat it with Per&s;picuity, and I beforehand beg &s;ome Mercy of the Critics.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IT has been long &s;ince recommended to the Tribe of Criticks, to adju&s;t and &s;ettle their Ideas, in a clear and regular Order, by fixing the di&s;tinct Meaning annexed to each Term they make u&s;e of in conveying their Re|marks. If this Advice was properly adhered to, it would cut Matters very &s;hort in all Debates, which ari&s;e upon Points of Literature; and would enable tho&s;e, who a&s;pire to the Province of Critici&s;m, to pa&s;s their Judgment with Preci&s;ion. But the Rever&s;e of this is fre|quently the Ca&s;e, and I &s;hall at pre&s;ent &s;ingle out two Expre&s;&s;ions, from a Multitude of others, which appear to me to be u&s;ed in a vague, random Manner, the determinate Meaning of either not being &s;ufficiently a&s;certained.</P>
<P>The Terms, I mean, are an HUMOURIST and a MAN OF HUMOUR. They are thought, by what I find, &s;ynonymous by many People, which mu&s;t be the Source of numberle&s;s Mi&s;takes. To define each, may be, perhaps, Matter of &s;ome Difficulty; but if I un|der&s;tand them right, the Reader is welcome to what Light I can give him into the Matter.</P>
<P>An HUMOURIST, I take to be, one under the In|fluence of &s;ome remarkable Oddity, or unaccountable Whim, which has taken &s;uch &s;trong Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="241" REF="252">Mind, and has &s;o in&s;inuated it&s;elf into all its Ope|rations, that it mixes with the common Train of his Ideas, and thereby gives &s;uch a Ca&s;t to his Way of thinking, that every Thing &s;trikes him in a different Light from the re&s;t of his Fellow-Creatures, and of Con&s;equence, every Thing he does, is al&s;o in an ex|travagant Manner.</P>
<P>I have not been able to inve&s;tigate, in any Hi&s;torian, the fir&s;t Appearance of this Species of Men in this King|dom. Whether it was in the Nature of the <HI>Aborigines,</HI> or fir&s;t Inhabitants of this I&s;land; or whether it made its Inroad among us, with that general Conflux of dif|ferent Nations, which landed here, is a Point not very ea&s;y to determine. One Thing is clear, that they are of a long Standing among us, and indeed they thrive with &s;uch large Increa&s;e in this our Soil, that there is room to apprehend, the whole Nation will &s;hortly be|come a Nation of odd Fellows.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the many Extravagancies, which this Set of Men are addicted to, they have all a &s;trange Notion, that they mu&s;t have their own Way. Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> has ob&s;erved, that there is a Proverb by which they are, in a great Mea&s;ure, governed. <HI>He that will have a May-pole, &s;hall have a May-pole.</HI> They are entirely attached to the Gratification of their own particular Bent; their Imaginations have contracted &s;uch whim&s;i|cal Habits, that they &s;ee Things through a Medium, to which Men of a more rea&s;onable Turn, are Stran|gers; and thence it re&s;ults, that wild and fanta&s;tick Opinions are delivered upon all Topics, and their Con|duct is nothing but a Series of Incon&s;i&s;tencies.</P>
<P>The Per&s;on, who falls into this Way of thinking, is properly &s;peaking an HUMOURIST, and <HI>Quidquid vult, valde vult,</HI> &s;hould be the Motto of every one of them; they being all inflexible in Pur&s;uit of their Inclinations. It is a trite Remark, that the Spirit of Liberty and In|dependency, which is diffu&s;ed throughout this Kingdom,
<PB N="242" REF="253">contrioutes very much to feed this odd Turn, and to promote its Growth. I have mixed frequently in the Meetings of <HI>Humouri&s;ts,</HI> in order to animadvert upon their Ways; and have always ob&s;erved, that none of them will &s;uffer them&s;elves to be controuled, for this exceilent Rea&s;on; becau&s;e, <Q>D&mdash;mn my Blood, I can club my Reckoning as well as any Man, and I have been an Hou&s;e-keeper, Man and Boy the&s;e thirty or forty Years; and I pay my Rent, and &s;o a Fig for King <HI>G</HI>&mdash;.</Q>&mdash;Thus, while the HUMOURIST has his Property &s;ecured to him, by the &s;alutary Laws of our noble Con&s;titution, he will enjoy his Independency; to give a Proof of which, he thinks it e&s;&s;ential to have a Value for no Man; and to plea&s;e him&s;elf, though at the Expence of his Company, is his darling Delight.</P>
<P>It is to the Ob&s;ervation of the&s;e Oddities, that we owe the MAN OF HUMOUR; and hence is deducible a Definition, or rather De&s;cription of his Character. He is one who <HI>Eyes Natures Walks,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;inely phra&s;es it, and <HI>catches the Manners living, as they ri&s;e.</HI> He &s;ees the Pololes, which have taken Root in the Man, and the many motly Circum&s;tances, which adhere to him. He looks, as it were, into his very mind, per|ceives there the Jaundice, through which every Thing pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es; and from whence all Objects derive their Hue; he &s;ees the Imagination tinged with this &s;trange Dye, and all the Affections of the Soul di&s;coloured by it. He views &s;uch Traces formed in his Brain, that it is ren|dered quite different, from that of any other human Creature; and thus the MAN OF HUMOUR perceives the &s;ecret and internal Springs of Action, which lead on the HUMOURIST; he cannot help &s;miling to &s;ee the Operations of his Soul &s;o extravagant, and be|ing acquainted with the latent Cau&s;e of tho&s;e odd Ap|pearances which di&s;clo&s;e them&s;elves upon all Occa&s;ions, he afterwards repre&s;ents them to the World in true and lively Colours.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="254">Thus may the two Characters in Que&s;tion, be de|&s;cribed, though they have been &s;o much mi&s;taken by many People. The Confu&s;ion, I apprehend, is owing to the vague U&s;e of the Word HUMOUR, which is pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly applied to both. It is common to &s;ay of the HUMOURIST, he has his Humour, or it is his Humour, and of the humourous Man, we a&s;&s;ert, that he has a great Fund of Humour. In both Ca&s;es, the Phra&s;e car|ries with ta different Sen&s;e, denoting in the former In|&s;tance, the Foible or Whim, which operates upon the Man's Conduct, and in the latter &s;ignifying that Plea|&s;antry, which repre&s;ents the odd Fellow in a diverting Light. The Poverty of our Language has introduced this ambiguous U&s;e of the Word, but if People would be carefur to acquire Per&s;picuity in their Ideas, and the Terms they expre&s;s them by, it would prevent much Perplexity and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>For In&s;tance, it would be ab&s;urd in any Critic, to call the inimitable Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> an HUMOURIST, but he who would pronounce him to be a Man of exqui&s;ite Humour, would, I believe, expre&s;s &s;omething more pertinent to the Point. In like Manner, Mr <HI>Hogarth</HI> has exhibited in his Pieces, with the mo&s;t ma&s;terly Strokes of his Pencil, an whole Set of <HI>Humouri&s;ts,</HI> and the ingenious Arti&s;t, who thus enchant our Eye, is un|doubtedly a MAN OF HUMOUR.</P>
<P>There is another Cau&s;e, to which, in my Opinion, this Mi&s;take has been greatly owing; it frequently hap|pens, that a MAN OF HUMOUR, is at the &s;ame Time in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, an HUMOURIST him&s;elf. The&s;e two Characters, thus blended together, have often a very happy Effect, and &s;erve to heighten each other. This we Experience in <HI>Shaie&s;pear</HI>'s <HI>Fal&s;taff,</HI> in whom we find united in a plea&s;ing A&s;&s;emblage, the mixed Qua|lities of the&s;e two different Characters. Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Love of Plunder, his Preten&s;ions to Deeds of Hardine&s;s; his Aver&s;ion to Cowards, and his moralizing on the Man|ners
<PB N="244" REF="255">of the Age, cannot but appear whim&s;ical, when we con&s;ider, that he is &s;itter to drink Sack and un|button him after Dinner, than to attempt Feats of Prowe&s;s, that he is an accompli&s;hed Coward in his Heart, and that his Way of Life is quite abandoned and di&s;&s;olute. The&s;e are the Circum&s;tances, which de|note him an odd Fellow, but his quick Perception of the Foibles of his Neighbours, and his Vivacity in ex|hibiting them in a ridiculous Point of View, are the Qualities which con&s;titute him a MAN OF HUMOUR. This la&s;t Circum&s;tance, I apprehend, makes Sir <HI>John,</HI> a Favourite with every Body, and endears him to all the Sons of Merriment; and in this, if I mi&s;take not, lies the chief Difference between <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> and <HI>Ben Joha&s;on.</HI> The Characters produced by the latter, are always di&s;agreeably odd; their Whims are &s;o ex|travagant, that they &s;ometimes de&s;erve rather the Name of Madmen, and there is hardly any Thing in any of them, that would induce a Gentleman to &s;pend an Even|ing with them.</P>
<P>It requires a clo&s;e Knowledge of the World, to ex|hibit Per&s;onages of this Ca&s;t on the Stage. Every Idea that ri&s;es in the Mind of an odd Fellow, his va|rious Ways of Thinking and Incon&s;i&s;tencies, mu&s;t be the con&s;tant Object of the Poets Attention, and he mu&s;t be careful to give to each his &s;pecific Language. The Player mu&s;t not only be acquainted with the human Heart, and human Under&s;tanding; but he has al&s;o a farther Step to take. He mu&s;t Watch the HUMOURIST in every Circum&s;tance; his Manner of Delivery, his Tone of Voice, the Ca&s;t of his Eye, his every Ge&s;ture and Attitude mu&s;t fall immediately under his In&s;pec|tion; and to all this, he mu&s;t add, the rare Talent of concealing his Art.</P>
<P>In this Point, I am apt to think, Mr. <HI>Woodward,</HI> ex|cellent as he is, from an Over-warmth of Spirit, &s;ometimes deficient. I would &s;ubmit it to him&s;elf, whether his Feel|ing
<PB N="245" REF="256">of the Whim&s;ies of &s;ome Characters is not now and then too lively, and whether his Sen&s;ations do not carry him &s;o far in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages, as to make it vi&s;ible, that he is con&s;cious of the Oddity of the Appearance, even while he is per&s;onating the Man?&mdash;His <HI>Bobadil</HI> is one of the Exceptions to this Remark, and his not permit|ting his Fancy to run into Riots in that Part, has &s;o &s;ine an Effect, that I am per&s;uaded, were healways equally upon his Guard, his greate&s;t Enemy would have nothing to do but to admire him.</P>
<P>Whoever has &s;een Mrs. <HI>Pritchard</HI> in <HI>Beatrice,</HI> in <HI>Maria,</HI> in <HI>Clarinda,</HI> &amp;c. will recollect &s;uch lively and acknow|ledged Touches of Nature as can hardly be equalled, unle&s;s the Plea&s;antry of Mrs. <HI>Clive</HI> in her very humourous Walk of Comedy, may be deemed to rival them.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude without Mention of Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> who is certainly admirable in every Species of acting. In Tragedy, his Power over the Pa&s;&s;ions is too well known, to be here in&s;i&s;ted on, and in Comedy, every Thing is impre&s;&s;ed by him on his Audience with the nice&s;t Skill, and in &s;uch Parts as <HI>Benedict</HI> and Sir <HI>John Brute,</HI> he is at once an <HI>Humouri&s;t</HI> and a <HI>Man of Humour</HI> with the mo&s;t diverting Plea&s;antry. I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s this Paper, after applying the Words of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> on this Occa&s;ion. "He is not more a Ma&s;ter of <Q>the <HI>great,</HI> than of the <HI>ridiculous</HI> in human Nature; of our noble&s;t Tenderne&s;&s;es, than of our vaine&s;t Foibles; of our &s;tronge&s;t Emotions, than of our idle&s;t Sen&s;ations.</Q></P>

<P>_AS I was looking over my Regi&s;ter Book, the other Morning, in order to &s;elect pro|per Articles of Intelligence for the En|tertainment of my Readers, a tall thin vi&s;aged Man flung open my Room-Door, and with &s;ome Earne&s;tne&s;s begged he might have half an Hour's Conver&s;ation with me.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IF I remember right, you &s;ome Time &s;ince recommended the Maxim of an old <HI>Greek</HI> Philo&s;opher, who lays it down as a Rule, that we &s;hould not &s;uffer any Thing in Life to take too &s;trong an Hold of our Imagination, becau&s;e that Power of the Mind is found to have a very con&s;iderable Influence upon all our Sentiments and all our Actions. Certainly
<PB N="253" REF="264">when the Reins are thrown loo&s;e upon the Neck of un|governed Fancy, we become in&s;tantly addicted to what is called in the common Phra&s;e <HI>Ca&s;tle-Building,</HI> than which there is not a more dangerous Exerci&s;e of our in|tellectual Faculties. It is a continual roving of our Thoughts to ideal Scenes of Joy; Plea&s;ure is our Pur|&s;uit, and when it does not appear within our Reach, we catch at the Shadow, in&s;tead of the Sub&s;tance; we ramble into a kind of Fools Paradi&s;e, and lounge away our Hours in the imaginary Gardens of a dreaming <HI>Eficurus,</HI> from whence it re&s;ults that the Sinews of the Under&s;tanding become relaxed; an enervating Stillne&s;s &s;preads over all the Powers of the Soul, which is con|&s;tantly di&s;&s;olved in Luxury of its own Creation; fond Self-love holds up to us a plea&s;ing Picture, throws &s;ome Joys into Per&s;pective, flings what is di&s;agree|able into Shades, and totally hides from us the thorny Parts of the Land&s;kip. The&s;e perhaps may be accounted Plea&s;ures, but they are in the main like the vi&s;ionary Ideas excited by taking <HI>Laudanum;</HI> at the &s;ame Time that they admini&s;ter a Flow of Spirits, they invade our Nerves and render us entirely unfit for any Sphere of Action.</P>
<P>An In&s;tance of this intoxicating Power of <HI>Ca&s;tle-Building</HI> I have ob&s;erved for &s;ome Time pa&s;t in Mrs. <HI>Vainlove,</HI> who has &s;pent the greate&s;t Part of her Life in a waking Dream, and can hardly be accounted one of this World, as &s;he has been, in the general, quite ab&s;tracted from Society, and has dwelt mo&s;tly in the airy Regions of Fancy. Mrs. <HI>Vainlove,</HI> in the greener Part of her Life, was flattered into a Notion of her own Beauty, by which Means &s;he became fond of Power. Her Eyes, &s;he thought gave her a <HI>Right divine</HI> to be a pretty Tyrant over the oppo&s;ite Sex, and as the Ima|gination never deals out Ble&s;&s;ings with a &s;canty Hand, her Sway &s;oon became in Appearance as exten&s;ive as her mo&s;t delu&s;ive Hopes could de&s;ire. But though &s;he
<PB N="254" REF="265">led the whole Race of Man in Captivity, &s;he at length conde&s;cended to let an ambitious Lover a&s;pire to her Bed. The Con&s;equence of this Conde&s;cen&s;ion was, that in due Cour&s;e of Time &s;he was the happy Mo|ther of a fair Daughter, in whom &s;he &s;aw her own Fea|tures, but moulded with greater Delicacy. Self-love inclined her to admire this flattering Likene&s;s of her&s;elf, and the Emanations of Fancy be&s;towed upon her every Grace. Before Mi&s;s could walk, in the Mother's Eye &s;he danced with all the Elegance of <HI>Auretti,</HI> and as &s;oon as her Tongue began to utter imperfect Words; <Q>Lord what a deal of Wit the Child has? Dear Cou|&s;in a'nt you a&s;toni&s;hed at her? 'pon Honour I never taught her that.</Q> In Proce&s;s of Time Mi&s;s <HI>Vain|love</HI> devoured up the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions of Admiration with a greedy Ear, and &s;he began in&s;en&s;ibly to believe every Word perfectly true, till at length her Imagination took the very &s;ame Turn which had di&s;torted the Thoughts of her Mother before, and a Series of Years, in&s;tead of bani&s;hing the Deceit, but &s;erved to give a &s;tronger Tincture to her Fancy.</P>
<P>When <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Dido</HI> is cro&s;&s;ed in Love, and &s;he finds her&s;elf upon the Point of being de&s;erted by the <HI>Trojan</HI> Prince, her ready Fancy &s;eizes the Occa&s;ion to di&s;turb her with vi&s;ionary Scenes of Solitude, in which &s;he thinks her&s;elf abandoned and forlorn.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Semperque relinqui</L>
<L>Sola &s;ibi, &s;emper longam incomitata videtur</L>
<L>Ire Viam. &mdash;</L></Q>
<P>But with Mi&s;s <HI>Vainlove</HI> the Cafe is quite rever&s;ed; though it &s;hould happen that her Fate removes her from the dear Society of Man; though the &s;udden Ex|cre&s;cence of a Pimple on her Face or Neck &s;hould doom her a Reclu&s;e, until her Skin regains its native Alaba&s;ter Smoothne&s;s; though an untractable Lock &s;hould refu&s;e
<PB N="255" REF="266">to join in amicable Confederacy with the Re&s;t of her Head-dre&s;s, and determine her in a Fit of Peevi&s;hne&s;s to &s;eque&s;ter her&s;elf from the World, yet &s;till &s;he reigns Queen of the A&s;&s;embly, and has a Circle of Beaux about her; the ideal Footman's Rap &s;ounds Tran&s;port to her Ear, and &s;he is every In&s;tant receiving the Ho|mage of contending Lovers, who have no Exi&s;tence but in her own Brain. Her Mother confirms her in the Deception, and through the Force of Habit, they are con&s;tantly amu&s;ed with Pictures of their own Creation; like tho&s;e, who, Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> tells us in his Treati&s;e on the <HI>Conduct of the Under&s;tanding,</HI> through &s;ome Di&s;tem|perature in their Blood, or any other internal Cau&s;e, &s;ee a Variety of Colours pa&s;&s;ing continually before them, and frequently perceive a Groupe of human Fi|gures, Soldiers and Combatants marching in Proce&s;|&s;ion before the deluded Eye of di&s;tempered Fancy.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Vainlove</HI> has carried Matters to &s;uch an Extreme, that &s;he really thinks her&s;elf the mo&s;t celebrated Toa&s;t about Town at pre&s;ent; <HI>Ryan</HI> at the <HI>King's Arms</HI> is under infinite Obligations to her for the plentiful Libations of Burgundy, which have been poured out to her Beauty at his Hou&s;e; and almo&s;t all the Taverns in the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> have felt in this Way, the happy Influence of her Beauty.</P>
<P>Her Footman has the be&s;t Place in <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e as &s;he has taken it into her Head, he is in the con&s;tant Receipt of Bribes at all public Places, to induce him to tell the Name of his young Mi&s;tre&s;s, and the Place of her Abode. Madam <HI>La Place</HI> owes a great deal of her Succe&s;s in Bu&s;ine&s;s to Mi&s;s <HI>Vainlove</HI>'s having the Lead of all the Fa&s;hions, and directing the Ladies of her Acquaintance to her Milliner, that they may &s;et them&s;elves off with the &s;ame Advantages of Orna|ment.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Vainlove,</HI> without having one real Lover, has con&s;tantly a large Number of fancied Slaves to her
<PB N="256" REF="267">Frowns and Smiles, and from thence it happens, that &s;he looks upon all the Women as a Set of Creatures that envy her, and the Men &s;he con&s;iders as her Vo|taries, fit for nothing but to grace her Triumph. There is nothing more common with her than to be within a few Days of being married to a Man of large Fortune, even when &s;he never exchanged a Word with him. <Q>Well, to be &s;ure, &s;ays &s;he, it's &s;urprizing how Things are whi&s;pered about; the common Report is, that I am to be married to Mr. <HI>What-do ye-call-him,</HI> with|out Doubt it is in my Power.&mdash;but&mdash;Lord the whole Town has it.</Q> It is in vain to a&s;&s;ure her that the Town does not trouble its Head about her; her Mo|ther has told her &s;he does not meet &s;o fine a Wo|man any where, and &s;o the Opiate works. I met both the&s;e egregious Characters at <HI>Vauxhall</HI> a few Nights &s;ince, when they informed me, that the whole Set of foreign Amba&s;&s;adors were now in the young Ladies Train, and that **** who is a Man of Con|&s;equence and Forture in the Country, which he re|pre&s;ents, is ab&s;olutely expiring for Mi&s;s <HI>Vainlove.</HI> It happened, that after this I paid her &s;everal Vi&s;its, and never meeting any of her florid Retinue, I took the Liberty to mention that I never had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her gay Set of Enamoratos; to this Mrs. <HI>Vain|love</HI> replied, that &s;he had given them their An&s;wer, <Q>Whenever we give them their An&s;wer, they never come again.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the&s;e two Ladies never &s;ee any Thing in its proper Colour; they think their Dreams Reali|ties, and, like mad People, are con&s;tantly rea&s;oning right from wrong Principles. Pray, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> mi|ni&s;ter to a Mind di&s;ea&s;ed, as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> phra&s;es it; let them know that they cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t very long upon &s;uch airy Plea&s;ures, as they imagine to them&s;elves, and con|vince them, that there is great Truth in what is &s;aid, perhaps too loo&s;ely by the comic Poet.</P>

<P>_I HAVE lately done my&s;elf the Plea&s;ure of peru&s;ing the &s;everal Performances in Critici&s;m, with which <HI>Voltaire</HI> has in|troduced into the World his various poeti|cal Compo&s;itions. That excellent Author has the Mode&s;ty to call mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;hort E&s;&s;ays, by the Name of, <HI>Fugitive Pieces of Literature.</HI> But the &s;malle&s;t Pro|ductions of &s;o plea&s;ing a Writer, are indelible, and will be read with Plea&s;ure, while there remains any Ta&s;te for a fine Turn of Sen&s;e and an elegant Felicity of Ex|pre&s;&s;ion.

<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>To Mon&s;ieur</HI> VOLTAIRE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Republic of Letters has happily removed that aukward Di&s;tance, and that extreme Difficulty of Acce&s;s, which Policy, mini&s;terial Artifice, and in&s;olent Pride have e&s;tabli&s;hed in the ordinary Intercour&s;e of Life; by which Means it has obtained, that the ea&s;y Sea&s;ons of Application, the <HI>mollia tempora fandi,</HI> are at all times allowed to every Member of the &s;erene Re|public already mentioned; and, while Decency and good Manners are pre&s;erved, an ea&s;y Habitude &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the highe&s;t and the lowe&s;t of that augu&s;t Body. Freedom of Conver&s;e is the happy Colli&s;ion, which has &s;truck out &s;o many new Lights in every Thing relating to the Sciences and the liberal Arts; and it has been ob&s;erved that there is no Book &s;o mean but &s;ome u&s;eful Hint may po&s;&s;ibly be derived from it. On this Account it may be proper to wave all Offers at an Apology, for the Liberty an unknown Writer allows him&s;elf, in ad|dre&s;&s;ing a Letter to &s;o enlightened a Genius; I &s;hall only premi&s;e, on this Occa&s;ion, that I take the Pen in Hand with that Re&s;pect to which you are certainly en|titled by the Superiority of your Parts; but as I have taken Exceptions to &s;ome Critici&s;ms, &s;cattered up and down in your Writings, I cannot &s;uppre&s;s a very &s;trong Inclination of making &s;ome Remarks upon them.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved, Sir, that you are apt to reprobate the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage, with &s;ome Degree of Acrimony, whenever it comes in your Way, and that you have not he&s;itated to make free with our immortal <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> after a Manner, which, in my Opinion, is incon&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="260" REF="271">with that Relish for manly Sense, which seems to be your Characteristic, and in a Stile, which to me ap|pears destitute of your usual Delicacy. If I should say, that the boasted <HI>Biens&eacute;ance</HI> of your Country has relin|quished you in some of these Pa&s;sages, I flatter myself that upon a Review of them, you will not totally disa|vow it. The most striking of the various Judgments, which you have vented against the greatest Dramatic Genius in the World, is found in your Discourse pre|fixed, to your Tragedy of <HI>Semiramis,</HI> and is literally translated into <HI>English</HI> as follows.</P>
<Q>I do not mean to justify the Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet</HI> in every Particular; it is in Fact a barbarous Piece, abounding with such gro&s;s Absurdities, that it would not be tolerated by the Vulgar in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> The Hero of the Play runs mad in the second Act, and his Mistre&s;s meets with the same Misfortune in the third. The Prince takes <HI>Ophelia</HI>'s Father for a Rat, and kills him, and, in Despair, she throws her|self into a River. Her Grave is dug on the Stage, and the Grave-Digger, with a Skull in his Hand, amuses himself with a String of miserable Jests, while the Prince answers them in Language equally dis|gusting. <HI>Hamlet,</HI> his Mother, and Father-in-Law drink together on the Stage. They divert themselves with Bottle-Songs, <HI>(Chansons &agrave; boire)</HI> they quarrel, they fight and kill. One would imagine this Play the Production of a drunken Savage. And yet among these Absurdities, which render the <HI>English</HI> Drama absolutely barbarous, there are some Strokes in <HI>Ham|let,</HI> worthy of the most exalted Genius. This has al|ways been Matter of Astonishment to me; it looks as if Nature, in pure Sport, diverted herself with mix|ing in <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Head every thing sublime and great, with all that can be conceived low, mean and detestable.</Q>
<P><PB N="261" REF="272">It is thus the elegant and sensible <HI>Voltaire</HI> speaks of <HI>Shakespear.</HI> I would submit it to yourself, Sir, whether this Criticism is candid, and whether it is a fair Dis|cu&s;sion of the Tragedy in Question. We do not con|cern ourselves in this Country with what is agreeable to the Taste of the Vulgar in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Italy;</HI> we know that the <HI>Clinquant</HI> of an Opera, or a <HI>Comedie Ballet</HI> is more acceptable to their Refinement, than the sterling Bullion of an <HI>English</HI> Performance; but we might ex|pect from a Writer of Eminence, a truer and more exact Opinion. <HI>Hamlet,</HI> Sir, does not run mad, though if he did, King <HI>Lear</HI> has proved what a beautiful Distre&s;s might arise from it; he counterfeits Madne&s;s, for his own private End, but no body ever imagined that he thinks he is killing a Rat, when he slays <HI>Polonius.</HI> If you will be pleased to recollect the Pa&s;sage, you will find that he takes him for his Better, meaning the King, and that the Rat is only mentioned to save Ap|pearances.</P>
<P>That <HI>Ophelia</HI>'s Grave is dug on the Stage cannot be refuted; but that very Indecorum produces so many fine Reflections, and such an excellent Vein of Mora|lity, as perhaps, cannot be parallel'd by the <HI>Scene Fran|coise,</HI> and is, without doubt, warmer, and more interest|ing, than the frigid, unimpa&s;sioned Declamation of a more correct Writer. I cannot recollect that <HI>Hamlet</HI> ever shocked me with miserable Jests upon this Occa|sion; not do I remember that any of them are such honest Bottle Companions as to carouse and sing merry Catches on the Stage. Pray consider, Sir, that our Lan|guage, though no way inferior to the <HI>French,</HI> is not uni|versally understood Abroad, and from your Representa|tion of Matters, it may be inferred that our great Poet is really the <HI>drunken Savage,</HI> you have thought pro|per to call him. This would be derogating from the greatest Poet the World has ever seen since the Days
<PB N="262" REF="273">of <HI>Homer,</HI> and, I believe you will grant, is dealing un|fairly with a Man, whom you cannot but reverence.</P>
<P>When you confe&s;s that he has many Flights of the highest Elevation, you make an Approach towards jus|tice; but I cannot help thinking that you are some|what like a Painter, who lays on just and proper Colouring, and then instantly effaces it, when you and that you are astonished at his sublime Excursions of Fan|cy. I should have expected from your Candour, that you would rather have said, it is a Pity that he, who soared to such glorious Heights, should ever tire his Eagle Wing, and fall beneath himself. You may re|member, that it is with this good Temper <HI>Longinus</HI> talks of <HI>Homer;</HI> they are Dreams, says he, but they are the Dreams of <HI>Homer.</HI> He might, perhaps, with as much Propriety as you, have given the Appellation of a <HI>drunken Savage,</HI> have called him AN OLD DOTARD, and a&s;serted that some of his long Stories are detestable but a candid Critic forgives the Imbecilities of human Na|ture, and pa&s;&s;es Sentence like a mild and good-natured Judge.</P>
<Q>Cum tabulis animum censoris sumet honesti.
<BIBL><HI>HOR.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>In one of your Letters concerning the <HI>English</HI> Nation, you are greatly pleased with a Saying of the late Lord <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> in Relation to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough.</HI> "He was," replied that ingenious Nobleman when his Opinion was asked, "so great a Man, that I "have forgot his Faults." Something like this might be your Judgment upon <HI>Shakespear;</HI> and it was more particularly incumbent on you, to treat his Me|mory with respect, because, I apprehend, you owe very great Obligations to him in many of your own dramatic Writings. We frequently perceive you lighting your Torch at his Fire; in your <HI>Mahomet, Macbeth marshals you the Way that you are going;</HI> in many other Scenes
<PB N="263" REF="274">we can catch your Eye fixed upon our immortal Bard; and in your <HI>Semiramis</HI> you have adventured to introduce a Ghost, in Imitation of the very Play, which has oc|casioned the Severity already cited. The Succe&s;s you met with upon that Occasion might serve to convince you of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s inimitable Merit. The <HI>Parterre,</HI> if I mistake not, turned their Backs to the Stage, and blew their Noses; while the Ghost on our Theatre never fails to impre&s;s an awful Stillne&s;s on every Mind. This, Sir, give me leave to a&s;sure you, is not owing to the Barbarity of our Taste, but to the amazing Power of our Poet's Imagination, which could explore the undiscovered Regions of Eternity, and recal the slecting Spirit, with a Solemnity of Ideas responsive to the Occasion.</P>
<P><HI>Shakespear</HI> is a kind of established Religion in Poetry, and his Bays will always stourish with undiminished Ver|dure. When I say this, I am not for maintaining that he is not guilty of Transgre&s;sions, but for every Trans|gre&s;sion he recompences his Auditors with Beauties, which no Art will ever equal. That the Rules esta|blished by <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> are agreeable to Nature, I am ready to allow, and that inferior Geniuses may avail themselves by a skilful Conformity to them, I as freely a&s;sent to. But Fable is but a secondary Beauty; the Exhibition of Character, and the Excitement of the Pa&s;sions, justly claiming the Precedence in dramatic Poetry. It is in Writing as in Gardening; where Na|tures does not afford spontaneous Beauties, recourse must be had to the Embellishments of slow endeavouring Art, to the Regularity of uniform Vistas, the Intricacy of elaborated Mazes, and a studied Insertion of Ever|greens; but when the Course of the Country of itself presents attractive Scenes on every Side, when the Trees branch out with a free Expansion, and the bold Prospect surprizes with the Heath, the Lawn, the Hill,
<PB N="264" REF="275">and Valley, in wild Variety, the Littlene&s;s of tedious Culture is unnece&s;sary, and trifling Ornaments are un|looked for.</P>
<P>I shall conclude, with a Pa&s;sage from your own Works. <Q>Do not blush, Sir, to repent of your little Inadver|tencies. It is hard, but it is amiable to acknowledge our Errors.</Q> <HI>Ne rougi&s;sez point, Monsiour, de vous</HI> <Q><HI>repentir de vos petites Inadvertances. Il est dur, mais il est beau d'avouer ses fautes.</HI></Q></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Desire of acquiring Money has in all Ages actuated Mankind, and influenced their Conduct in various Shapes, ever since civil Polity framed different States and Re|publics, and since Convenience stamped an imaginary Value upon yellow Dirt, which soon rendered it by ge|neral
<PB N="266" REF="277">Consent a proper Exchange for the rest of the Commodities of the Earth. By the same Means that it became useful in the ordinary Nece&s;saries of Life, it also in Proportion administered to the Luxuries and magnificent Enjoyments of Society. The Gamester soon learned to carry a thousand Head of Cattle by Proxy to the Dice Room; so many Pieces of Ore be|came the Representatives of an adequate Number of Trees, and Things went on in this Progre&s;sion, till at length a modern Beau could carry as many sparkling Acres upon his little Finger, as would have strained a thousand <HI>Alaxes</HI> and <HI>Hectors</HI> of the Days of <HI>Homer.</HI> This last Remark I am proud to Fave an Opportunity of making, as the elegant Species, just mentioned, have for some Time unjustly been exposed to the Rail-Jery of the Epilogue to the <HI>Distre&s;sed Mother;</HI> whereas by this Account the pretty Fellows of these Times have very visibly a Superiority over the Prowe&s;s and Vigour of the much boasted antient Heroes.</P>
<P>But to return: An Ambition to ama&s;s Riches is cer|tainly very laudable, when it does not transgre&s;s the Bounds which are prescribed by Reason to all our Pas|sions in the general. While it is conducted with a View to a Competency, and the Enjoyment of the Requisites for Subsistence and Comfort; while it ope|rates with a Propensity to a Man's Friends, Relations, and, as <HI>Milton</HI> has it, all the Charities of Father, Son and Brother; and while it is the Source of Genero|sity, and an extensive Power of distributing Benefits to Mankind, it is, without any Manner of Doubt, a just Principle of Action; and though Self-love is the Pebble which stirs the Lake, the Circles, which it oc|casions, will always be pleasing and beautiful to the moral Sense.</P>
<P>But the Misfortune is, this Affection generally de|generates into Meanne&s;s, and has a fatal Tendency to
<PB N="267" REF="278">ruin the Understanding, and to corrupt the Heart. The intellectual Soil must not lie fallow for any long Time together; and it is by Freedom of Converse, and an habitual Intercouse with the enlightened Part of the World, that a mental Vigour is to be acquired; and when the Imagination is constantly attached to a parti|cular Set of Ideas, it becomes narrow by insensible De|grees, and for Want of that general Survey of the dif|ferent Objects, which are continually pa&s;sing on the Scene of Life, it is confined to a small Compa&s;s, and never ventures to make the least Excursion further. From this close Habit of Thinking, the Heart, too frequently, contracts a lazy Apathy, and grows entire|ly callous to all manner of Sensation. Our Pa&s;sions are involuntary, and are nothing else than the Impres|sions which external Objects usually make upon the hu|man Imagination, from the Operations of which we feel those sundry Emotions which are Incitements to spur us on from Theory to Practice, and which disclose themselves in our Actions, and are thence known to be|long to the amiable Train of <HI>Benevolence,</HI> or to be of the hateful Family of <HI>Selfishne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Ill-nature.</HI> In Pro|portion therefore as the Ideas which pa&s;s in the Mind are scanty, the Affections, which agitate the Heart, will be fewer; and both must at last rust to a Point, and fix in a State of unfeeling Indolence.</P>
<P>A Love of Money is at once the Source of those Deeds which carry with them a splendid Appearance, and those also which are at first Sight mean and contemptible. This Pa&s;sion has made many a Writer of Eminence, and many Scriblers in a Garret; it has animated the General at the Head of an Army, and the Clipper of Coin in his twi|light Room; it has for many Ages thundered in the Senate, wrangled at the Bar, and lulled from the Pulpit. To this it is owing that the Merchant boldly traverses the Globe, trusting to all the Dangers of the turbulent Ele|ment,
<PB N="268" REF="279">and that <HI>Buckhorse</HI> will receive as many severe Strokes of a Cane as you please, for Six-pence apiece.</P>
<P>The Art generally practised by People, who are de|sirous either to ama&s;s an over-grown Fortune, or to glean up a Livelihood, without the Talents to recom|mend themselves by striking out some new Discovery, or cultivating some advantageous Branch of Trade and Commerce, is to impose upon the Credulity of Man|kind; and by obtruding false delusive Circumstances to excite their Curiosity, raise their Admiration, and thus guil them to comply with their Artifices of Fraud and Imposition. This Metropolis has never wanted a suf|ficient Number of these Projectors, and, at present, I believe I may affirm, that it abounds with Cheats and Impostors, in every Station, in every Art and Science, and in every Circumstance of Life. The solemn Phy|sician, the specious Lawyer, the wordy Critic, and the bombast Poet, are found in all Quarters of the Town; and though they must be allowed to be very notable Masters of Deceit, I have lately made a Disco|very of a Personage, who greatly excels them all in their own Trade of Delusion and Hypocrisy. The Scheme of distributing Hand bills, importing that in <HI>Ivy-Lane, Magpye-Alley,</HI> or any other Quarter of the Town, LIVETH a regular Physician, who has spent many Years abroad, travelled all over <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> and is returned home North about to practise his Profe&s;sion for the Bene|fit of his Countrymen, is now entirely out of Vogue, and the Cheat is laughed at by all Degrees and Ranks of People. It is true, there are many other Plans on foot at present, which are somewhat more plausible than that which I have now touched upon; but among them all, I do not remember any Plan so well calculated to elevate and surprize, to keep up a Stare, as a new one which came into my Hands the other Day, as I was walking down <HI>Ludgate Hill.</HI> A tall meagre Man, with great Solemnity of Aspect, and strong Expre&s;sions of
<PB N="269" REF="280">Amazement in his Countenance, presented to me the following Billet, which many of my Readers can bear me Witne&s;s is transcribed faithfully and exactly.</P>
<Q><P>Mrs. <HI>SERMON</HI></P>
<P>Is removed from <HI>Whitchorse-yard, East-Smithfield,</HI> to the Sign of the <HI>Blue-Ball,</HI> in <HI>Naked-Boy Court, Lud|gate-Hill;</HI> you may turn in by the <HI>Salmon with a Drop in his Mouth,</HI> the second House in the Court.

<P>N. B. <HI>Cures the</HI> Ague <HI>at the Second Cup</HI> gratis.</P>
<P>I have heard that the present celebrated Dr. <HI>Wood|ward</HI> cures the Rupture, for any Person whatever, by wearing his own Bandages, which indeed hath fre|quently been Matter of Astonishment to me in my Hours of Reflection; but I must declare, in favour of Mrs. <HI>Sermon,</HI> that I think she performs greater Won|ders than any of them, and that her Undertaking is more likely to do Honour to our Country, than that of any other Schemist now in being. The Circum|stance of her living in <HI>Naked-Boy Court</HI> is well in|serted to raise Curiosity, and the Convenience of turn|ing in by the <HI>Salmon with a Drop in his Mouth</HI> will prove inviting, especially as every one will be desirous of seeing that curious Animal. How she contrives to answer Questions in <HI>Astrology</HI> is beyond my Comprehen|sion, but, if well peformed, must be highly useful to his Majesty's Subjects. She does-it also by Sea as well as Land, which is greatly advantageous to a trading Na|tion; and then her Spirit of Benevolence must tend greatly to endear her to every generous and humane Mind.</P>
<P>The <HI>Draught for the Stomach,</HI> the Powder for the <HI>Tooth-ach,</HI> and the <HI>Eye-Water,</HI> given <HI>gratis,</HI> are strong Indications of a public Spirit. Add to this that she cures the Ague at the second Cup for nothing; what
<PB N="270" REF="281">kind of Cup it is, I can't take upon me to &s;ay. But upon the whole I mu&s;t declare that Mrs. <HI>Sermon</HI> is in my Eye a very extraordinary Per&s;onage; and were I to decide the Precedence between her and all the Em|pyrics, Projectors, Fu&s;tian-Poets, Di&s;coverers of the Longitude, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the pre&s;ent Age, I &s;hould not he|&s;itate to pronounce Mrs. <HI>Sermon</HI> the mo&s;t notable among&s;t them all.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS there is a Court of Cen&s;orial Enquiry &s;ub&s;i&s;ting at <HI>Gray's-Inn,</HI> under your In|fluence, and as I &s;uppo&s;e, from the ap|parent Tendency of it, that it was de&s;igned in its fir&s;t In&s;titution to be a &s;econdary Aid to our Courts of Ju&s;tice, by taking Cognizance of tho&s;e Offences which are not puni&s;hable by any of the Statute Laws of this Realm, I mu&s;t take the Liberty to tran&s;mit to you an Information of &s;uch a Nature, that, I am convinced, you will think it either ought to be laid before the abovementioned Court, or that it de&s;erves to be treated with the Touches of your Pen.</P>
<P>To enter at once into the Bu&s;ine&s;s, I mu&s;t inform you, that I lately had Occa&s;ion to take a Jant down to <HI>Bath,</HI> and imagining that travelling in a Stage-Coach would not be di&s;agreeable, I took a Place in one of tho&s;e Vehicles, which &s;et out from the <HI>Bell Inn</HI>
<PB N="272" REF="283">behind the New Church in the <HI>Strand.</HI> Preci&s;ely at Two in the Morning, crack went the Coachman's Whip, and off we went with &s;ix Pa&s;&s;engers. It being quite dark at the Hour of &s;tarting, we began our Jour|ney without &s;o much as knowing one another's Faces, and we were protty well jolted on the Stones, before we were all properly adju&s;ted in our Places. For &s;ome Time we were entertained with a Concert of Groans, Sighs, Coughs, and other &s;uch agreeable Interjections, to fill up the Pau&s;e of Conver&s;ation, till having pa&s;&s;ed the Turnpike, and being arrived to the plain Road, the Gentlene&s;s of the Motion, and the Stillne&s;s of the Night compo&s;ed our Company to &s;leep, as I inferred from the Information of their No&s;es, which did not cea&s;e to ply the Ear, until the Morning began to tinge the Hemi&s;phere towards the Ea&s;t with white Streaks of Light, by the Help of which I could then di&s;cover who and who was together. Accordingly I peru&s;ed the Countenances of my Fellow-Travellers, and pretty plainly read in each Vi&s;age, that very Character, which a &s;hort Time convinced me was appropriated to each.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t and mo&s;t remarkable Per&s;onage was the Wife of a wealthy Inhabitant of <HI>Thames-&s;treet,</HI> going down to &s;ee Life, <Q>for it is really, &s;ays &s;he, enough to fill one up with the Vapours, to be eternally moped in that odious Part of the Town, and as &s;oon as I re|turn, I &s;hall prevail upon Mr. <HI>Narrowmind,</HI> &s;ince he has now picked up his Crums, to learn a little Ta&s;te, and remove to &s;ome gented Quarter.</Q> This Scheme met with the in&s;tant Approbation of her next Neigh|bour, a motherly Sort of Woman, who lets Lodgings at <HI>Bath,</HI> and with whom the polite Citizen was to &s;ix her Re&s;idence. The good old Landlady declared, as how &s;he was of Opinion, Folks of Mrs. <HI>Narrowmind</HI>'s Fortune &s;hould be accommodated with &s;ome Elegance; and then turning about, <Q>Ma'em, will you chu&s;e to ta&s;te the Liquor I have brought in this little Bottle?
<PB N="273" REF="284">I know by Experience, that it is the be&s;t Thing in the World to keep Wind out of the Stomach.</Q> This Propo&s;al was agreed to, and a few Minutes con|vinced the re&s;t of the Company, that a Dram is not only of &s;ingular U&s;e to keep Wind out of the Stomach, but al&s;o a mo&s;t excellent Expeller of what Wind may be accidentally lodged there.</P>
<P>While this agreeable Couple were &s;olacing them&s;elves, the Conver&s;ation was taken up by one, whom we &s;oon di&s;covered to be a <HI>Jew,</HI> bound for the Rendezvous of many of the People of Fa&s;hion, with the double View of partaking of the Diver&s;ions of the Place, and get|ting rid of a little <HI>French</HI> Pa&s;te, which lay upon his Hands. He harangued with great Volubility of Speech, and he frequently embelli&s;hed his Di&s;cour&s;e with many lively Fla&s;hes of a Diamond Ring, which played upon his Finger. Amid&s;t all his Vivacity, he took Care to be &s;ufficiently attentive to the grand Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;elling the abovementioned Pa&s;te, which was with him &s;o ma|terial a Point, that he never once mentioned the chief Object, which at pre&s;ent engro&s;&s;es the Thoughts of his whole Nation; but, in&s;tead of favouring us with his political Speculations, he amu&s;ed us with a Sight of numberle&s;s pretty Trinkets, the Beauties of which he explained with &s;uch an artful Di&s;play of his Finger, and &s;o many Flouri&s;hes of Speech, that he &s;oon clo&s;ed a Bargain with the fine Lady, whom I have already mentioned.</P>
<P>The next Per&s;on, whom I &s;hall mention, was a young Gentleman, who from a &s;lender Figure, and the Recommendation of five and twenty Years of Age, promi&s;ed him&s;elf &s;ome Succe&s;s among the Ladies, not|with&s;tanding the late Marriage Act. Not having &s;een a great deal of the World, his Mind was raw and unin|formed; &s;truck with Surprize at every Thing that of|&s;ered, and breaking out into idle Que&s;tions upon the mo&s;t minute Occurrence. I have often ob&s;erved, that
<PB N="274" REF="285">Memory is a prevailing Faculty in weak Intellects, and never fails to prove very trouble&s;ome in Com|pany; and as mo&s;t Things, when Judgment is want|ing, are laid up in that Storehou&s;e without Ta&s;te or Di&s;cernment, they are al&s;o produced in the &s;ame Manner; according to the old Proverb, <HI>Ill got, Ill gone.</HI> Having dabbled a little in &s;ome of our modern Poets, there hardly aro&s;e an Incident, but what our Fellow-Traveller would repeat twenty or thirty Ver&s;es in a Breath, from Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore,</HI> the CHOICE, or &s;ome &s;uch ingenious Work; and the Misfortune was, that what he la&s;t recited, opened new Traces, and he was &s;ure to continue, as long as his Memory &s;upplied him; like the Man at a Fair, who will &s;pew you up Ribband by the Yard, while there remains any in his Mouth; and this Similitude I take to be very picture&s;que on the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, with this Difference only, that what the latter evacuates, does not indicate a bad Dige&s;tion; whereas the former con&s;tantly di&s;covers a foul Stomach, which cannot contain its Crudities; and on this Account, I take your Ribband Spewer to be much the more agreeable Fellow of the two.</P>
<P>The fifth and la&s;t of the Company (as I intend to &s;ay nothing of my&s;elf) was a perfect Contra&s;t to the Cha|racter ju&s;t exhibited; as the Dealer in Ver&s;e never of|fered any Thing of his own, this Original was deter|mined never to make U&s;e of what came from another's Imagination, but depended entirely upon his own Stock for Fame and Feputation. There is a Saying of Doctor <HI>Swift</HI>'s which, in my Opinion, would be of &s;ingular U&s;e to many in human Life; "Never," &s;ays that great Genius in a Letter to a young Clergyman, <Q>attempt to &s;hew your Wit, becau&s;e it is at lea&s;t ten Thou&s;and to one that you have none.</Q> To this Pre|cept the Gentleman I am now &s;peaking of, paid no Kind of Regard, his Imagination being con&s;tantly upon the Stretch to <HI>elevate</HI> and <HI>&s;urprize,</HI> and <HI>all that;</HI> to
<PB N="275" REF="286">&s;tart new Turns of Fancy upon every Occa&s;ion, and, as it is generally expre&s;&s;ed, to &s;ay good Things. It was in vain to tell him, that it was not at all incum|bent on him to be &s;o extremely brilliant, and that his Company did not exact all that Emanation of Genius; my Friend could never be content to deliver him&s;elf in the ordinary Way, and you might perceive him per|petually in deep Study to expre&s;s him&s;elf upon the mo&s;t trivial Incident.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not trouble Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> with any of the &s;mart Prettine&s;&s;es which e&s;caped from this exalted Wit, but, having now acquainted you with the Characters of the Company, I leave it to your own Imagination to &s;ug|ge&s;t, in what Manner the Time mu&s;t have glided away among People who were all entirely attached to their prevailing Foibles, and who thought of nothing but the Gratification of their own particular Humours. During the whole Journey the Citizen's Wife talked of nothing but her Ta&s;te and Dignity, which the good Woman from <HI>Bath</HI> confirmed; the Ver&s;e-Spewer thought of nothing but reciting, and the Man of Wit was am|bitiou&s;ly new and lively. With regard to the <HI>Jew,</HI> he not only minded the Main-Chance in the Coach, but al&s;o at every Inn where we put up; and I remember, that at <HI>Marlborough,</HI> where we breakfa&s;ted the &s;e|cond Morning, we were delayed for a con&s;iderable Time, till Search was made after this mercantile I i|nerant, who was at length found &s;elling a Pair of Buckles to a Gentleman ju&s;t arrived in a Po&s;t-Chai&s;e.</P>
<P>I think, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> you have already mentioned an Attention to Self alone, as one of the greate&s;t Errors in Society; as it mu&s;t be more particularly &s;o, when People are tied to each other for any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pace of Time, I could wi&s;h for a Re&s;ormation in this Particular. In the <HI>Spectator</HI> I remember to have &s;een a Propo&s;al to place a Sy&s;tem of Rules for Behaviour on the Side of every Stage Coach in the Kingdom: Now, Sir, as I think
<PB N="276" REF="287">&s;omething of this Nature ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite at pre&s;ent, if you would be kind enough to employ a lei&s;ure Moment in this Way, it would, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, tend to promote good Manners among the People of this Kingdom, and would oblige him, who is with great Re&s;pect,</P>

<P>_A Great deal of Wit and Raillery has been exerted by &s;everal polite Writers again&s;t the predominant Fa&s;hion among the La|dies, of &s;etting off their Charms with the Addition of Paint. Our great <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has put a very &s;evere Remark into the Mouth of his <HI>Hamlet</HI> in the Scene with <HI>Ophelia; Heaven hath given ye one Face, and ye make your&s;elves another.</HI> This Thought has been twi&s;ted and tortured into a thou&s;and different Shapes by every little Endeavourer at an Epigram for a long Time pa&s;t, and the Cu&s;tom has been frequently cen&s;ured as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olly imported from our Neighbours the <HI>French.</HI> As the Art of giving an artificial Tincture to the Skin, ap|pears to me to admit of many favourable Circum&s;tances, I &s;hall employ this Day's Paper in Vindication of my pretty Countrywomen.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem at fir&s;t an extreme bold Po&s;ition, if I a&s;&s;ert that Painting is not an Importation of foreign Refine|ment, but originally of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Growth; and yet, that this is the real State of the Ca&s;e, is &s;ufficiently known to the mo&s;t &s;uper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cial Dabbler in Hi&s;tory. <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> in his Account of the Inroad which he made upon our Ance&s;tors, gives a De&s;cription of the <HI>Aborigines</HI> of this I&s;land, which I &s;hall here tran&s;late. <HI>The Britons in general paint their Bodies with Woad, which gives a blue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">incture to the Skin, and lends them a formidable Affect in Battle.</HI> This, I think, may &s;erve to obviate the Imputation of imi|tating
<PB N="278" REF="289">the <HI>French</HI> in this Particular, which I take to be a Point of &s;ome Con&s;equence, as by this we cannot be charged with the Levity of having &s;ervilely copied from others. We find that the Ladies among the <HI>Briti&s;h Picts</HI> went entirely naked, and painted their Bodies all over with the <HI>Woad</HI> already mentioned. This mu&s;t un|doubtedly have afforded great Scope for Fancy, and in tho&s;e Days there mu&s;t certainly have been many eager Rival&s;hips among the Fair for Pre-eminence in point of Ta&s;te for Painting. For as the whole lovely Body was ornamented with different Figures and &s;undry various Repre&s;entations, according as Imagination &s;ugge&s;ted, the Variety of new Fa&s;hions mu&s;t have been extremely entertaining, each Fair-one being &s;tudious to adapt to each different Part of the Body that Degree of Co|louring and that Form, which mu&s;t have proved mo&s;t becoming; ju&s;t as our modern Ladies adju&s;t a Patch &s;o as to make the Contra&s;t &s;triking, and give &s;tronger Ex|pre&s;&s;ions to the adjacent Features. I have now by me the whole Hi&s;tory of a <HI>Briti&s;h Pict Coquette,</HI> found by a Friend of mine among &s;ome antient Manu&s;cripts, and &s;ent to me as a Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;&s;ibelana</HI> was the Lady's Name. She lived in the Capital of the <HI>Trinobantes,</HI> and was remarkable for a fine Stature, and an Head of Hair of a &s;urprizing Length, flowing in wanting Luxuriance down her Back. She always had at her Toilet &s;ome of the mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite <HI>Woad</HI> that could be any where procured, and &s;he was celebrated for her curious Art in preparing it for the Purpo&s;es of adorning her Per&s;on. The <HI>Woad</HI> being of it&s;elf of a bluci&s;h Ca&s;t, &s;he would &s;ometimes paint no Part of her Body, but where the Veins appeared, and to them &s;he gave &s;uch a delicate Colouring, that the pure and elequent Blood as the Poet calls it, &s;eemed to &s;hew it&s;elf through her tran&s;lucent Skin. As &s;oon as &s;he had e&s;tabli&s;hed this Fa&s;hion, and made the re&s;t of her sex her Imitators, &s;he would then &s;uddenly change
<PB N="279" REF="290">the Mode, and embelli&s;h her whole Body with various Devices.</P>
<P>On the left Side of her Brea&s;t &s;he would draw a young <HI>Cupid</HI> aiming an Arrow at her Heart, and on the Right a Lover langui&s;hing in amorous Indolence. Each Leg repre&s;ented an Admirer kneeling at her Feet, and imploring her Compa&s;&s;ion, while &s;he, with all the Complacence of &s;elf-approving Beauty, let fall her Eyes with Indifference and cold Di&s;dain. On her Back were repre&s;ented the emblematical Figures of a Train of Pages following her in her way with all the Officiou&s;|ne&s;s of careful Attendance. On other Parts of her Per&s;on was pre&s;ented to View, <HI>Venus</HI> in lovely Atti|tude emerging from the Sea; the <HI>Graces</HI> were al&s;o to be &s;een walking Hand in Hand, their Faces brightened with Chearfulne&s;s and mutual Love. In this Manner &s;he would attend at public Sacrifices, where all Eyes were often fixed on her alone; and frequently the ve|nerable <HI>Druid</HI> could not avoid, even in the Fervour of his Devotion, to ca&s;t a Glance upon &s;uch an attractive Profu&s;ion of Charms.</P>
<P>In this Manner <HI>Ca&s;&s;ibelana</HI> captivated the Hearts of all her male Beholders, who carved her Name upon every Oak in the Country, and the banks of <HI>Thames</HI> re-ecchoed to the Mu&s;ick of her Name. It was univer|&s;ally agreed that &s;he was the be&s;t Painter of her Age; her Colours were warm and glowing; her Figures bold and &s;triking, and the natural Motion of the different Parts of her Body made them appear &s;till more animated and actuated, as it were, with the animal Functions of real Life; an Advantage which the mo&s;t admired Portraits of the mo&s;t eminent Painters &s;ince her Days could never boa&s;t. In all public Places &s;he entirely out|&s;hined the re&s;t of her Sex, which made her the general Envy of the Ladies, who frequently combined in Parties of Scandal to her Di&s;advantage, even though Tea was not then known in the&s;e Parts of the World. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ibelana</HI>
<PB N="280" REF="291">was every Day pulled to pieces, according to the mo|dern Phra&s;e, and though the Ladies allowed that &s;he really had a very lively Fancy in all her Drawings, and an excellent De&s;ign in all her Drapery, yet they could not &s;ee that &s;he was &s;o fine a Woman, though to be &s;ure &s;he had a pretty Manner <HI>in putting on her Things,</HI> for &s;o they expre&s;&s;ed the Covering of <HI>Woad</HI> which &s;erved to conceal in &s;ome Mea&s;ure the natural Superficies of her Skin. I am apt to believe that the tran&s;parent Ca|puchin was imagined from a Practice of this famous &s;e|male <HI>Pict,</HI> becau&s;e at Times &s;he would lay on the Woad in &s;uch a Manner, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Line in his Tran&s;lation of <HI>Homer</HI> may ju&s;tly be applied to it;
<Q>Her Beauty &s;eems and only &s;eems to &s;hade.</Q> Upon the Whole, <HI>Ca&s;&s;ibelana</HI> was Leader of all the Fa&s;hions even in <HI>Kent,</HI> the Inhabitants of which were the mo&s;t poli&s;hed of all our I&s;landers, and, as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> tells us, differed but little from the Manners of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> in like manner as our modern fine Ladies boa&s;t at pre&s;ent an exact Conformity to <HI>French</HI> Manners.</P>
<P>From the foregoing Account, which I have rendered as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ible from the Manu&s;cript now in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it appears, that even in the Days of the pure&s;t Simplicity, Painting was the univer&s;al Practice; and therefore &s;trongly am I inclined to think it laudable in the amiable Sex at pre&s;ent. I am further plea&s;ed to &s;ee the Fa&s;hions of the Ladies tending more rapidly every Day to a greater Similitude to the Cu&s;toms of our Ance&s;tors; for it is very manife&s;t that they are every Day becoming more and more naked, and it is ob|&s;ervable that they who di&s;play mo&s;t of their lovely Bo|dies make the greate&s;t U&s;e of Paint, which in my Opinion, is not u&s;ed from a Motive of female Vanity, but as a mode&s;t and decent Covering to the Skin. I mu&s;t, by the Way take notice that there is one Cir|cum&s;tance in which the modern Practice of Painting differs from antient Simplicity. I do not find in the
<PB N="281" REF="292">Account of any Hi&s;torian, that the female <HI>Briti&s;h Picts</HI> applied the lea&s;t Tincture of the Woad to the natural Complexion of their Faces. For a Bloom and a Viva|city of Colour they tru&s;ted to Exerci&s;e, fre&s;h Air, and whole&s;ome Diet. But as the fa&s;hionable Vigils of Gam|ing were unknown in tho&s;e Days, it mu&s;t be allowed that this is an Improvement upon the Fa&s;hions of our Progenitors; and indeed it could not be expected that in tho&s;e rude Times &s;o elegant a Diver&s;ion could be known. For this we are indebted to modern Refine|ment, which has introduced Improvements in Manners, as well as in Arts and Sciences.</P>
<P>For my Part, I expect to &s;ee the Time when the Ladies will be to all Intents and Purpo&s;es as naked as our Ance&s;tors; and, in my Apprehen&s;ion, if Things proceed with equal Celerity, the Period is not very di&s;tant, as their Cloaths are amazingly reduced at both Ends within the&s;e few Years. We &s;hall not then com|plain, that the Importation of <HI>French</HI> Hoops, and <HI>French</HI> Fa&s;hions of all Sorts, are a Detriment to the Na|tion; Mercers and Milliners will be u&s;ele&s;s Things, and the Ladies will &s;pend the Hours of the Toilet in Draw|ing and Painting, by which Means I flatter my&s;elf that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fair will be able to boa&s;t their <HI>Guidos,</HI> their <HI>Titians,</HI> and their <HI>Raphaels.</HI> To this End an ingenious Gentleman of my Acquaintance is now drawing up a Sy&s;tem of Directions to a female Painter, which will &s;erve to aid their Invention, and give them a proper Notion of De&s;ign and Colouring in all their Faces, by which Means it is to be hoped they will greatly excel all the boa&s;ted Ma&s;ters in every School of Painting.</P>

<P>_At the la&s;t Meeting of our Club, Mr. <HI>Pla&s;tic,</HI> the <HI>Shafts|burian</HI> Philo&s;opher and Chairman for the Time being, de&s;ired he might furni&s;h the E&s;&s;ay of this Day.</P>
<P>_A Ta&s;te for the imitative Arts is the highe&s;t Embelli&s;hment and ultimate Fini&s;hing of an accompli&s;hed Mind; it gives an Elegance to a Man's Way of thinking, throws a Poli&s;h on his Manners, and by in&s;en&s;ible Degrees re|fines the Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections of the Soul. It may be added, that a fine Ta&s;te is the Inlet of &s;ome of the
<PB N="284" REF="295">mo&s;t delicate Plea&s;ures human Life is &s;u&s;ceptible of, and may therefore properly be called, in the Language of <HI>Shaft&s;ourian</HI> Philo&s;opy, <HI>the internal Sen&s;e,</HI> as, by Means of this Faculty, we are acquainted with many elegant Sen&s;ations, to which the Generality of Men &s;eem to be entirely Strangers. This Talent is not un|like the Power of &s;eeing, ju&s;t conferred on one who&s;e Eye never could di&s;tingui&s;h Colours; it opens new Traces of thinking, awakens plea&s;ing Ideas, and dif|fu&s;es a Complacence through the whole intellectual Frame.</P>
<P>There is nothing more common than to &s;ee Men, who, perceiving the Advantages which this elegant Turn gives to a cho&s;en Few, and ob&s;erving that Quickne&s;s of Sen&s;ibility for which they are remarkable, affect upon all Occa&s;ions to be endowed with the &s;ame nice Faculty of Perception; but the Misfortune is, they are ab&s;olutely callous to each fine Impre&s;&s;ion, and the Method they chu&s;e, to convince us of their Delicacy, is by pretending, that nothing is refined enough for them. Thus, while others di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by yielding to the Impul&s;e of a Pa&s;&s;ion artfully excited by a Strain of Mu&s;ic, a Poem, or a Picture, the&s;e Gentlemen would recommend them&s;elves upon the Strength of their having never been plea&s;ed at any Rate. This Proce|dure is for the mo&s;t part to be ob&s;erved in modern <HI>Cri|tics</HI> or the <HI>Malevoli.</HI> A Piece where every Beauty of Language and Sentiment is united, where in the &s;trik|ing Pa&s;&s;ages every Line is impa&s;&s;ioned, and &s;wells with the Emotion of the Soul, like Gla&s;s in a Furnace, in|formed by the Breath infu&s;ed into it, laid before one of this Cla&s;s, &s;hall be received with cold Di&s;dain; and a Compo&s;ition of <HI>Arne</HI>'s, full of all the Sweetne&s;s of mu|&s;ical Expre&s;&s;ion, &s;hall to their finer Organs &s;ound like the mo&s;t jarring Di&s;&s;onance. If a Man in a Club of Gentlemen &s;hould be perpetually di&s;plea&s;ed with every Thing, while the re&s;t of the Members perceive no
<PB N="285" REF="296">Cau&s;e of Complaint, I apprehend there would be a &s;trong Pre&s;umption, that his Mouth was at tho&s;e Sea|&s;ons greatly out of Ta&s;te; and with equal Propriety, whoever boa&s;ts an Over-refinement of Under&s;tanding, &s;hould be &s;et down, without He&s;itation, as one who&s;e mental Organs are di&s;tempered. As Matters are fre|quently managed, a fine Ta&s;te, in&s;tead of being a Power of receiving elegant Sen&s;ations, would prove an Avenue for Unea&s;ine&s;s, Di&s;content, and a con&s;tant Di&s;like of every Thing around us; and it would fare with this exqui&s;ite Degree of intellectual Feeling, as with him, who&s;e external Sen&s;es are framed to re|ceive acuter Impre&s;&s;ions than our Employments in Life will admit.</P>
<Q><L>Say what the U&s;e were finer Optics giv'n,</L>
<L>T' in&s;pect a Mite, not comprehend the Heav'n?</L>
<L>Or Touch, if tremblingly alive all o'er,</L>
<L>To &s;mart and agonize at ev'ry Pore?</L>
<L>Or, quick Effluvia darting thro' the Brain,</L>
<L>Die of a Ro&s;e in aromatic Pain?</L>
<BIBL><HI>POPE.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>But Nature has not ca&s;t us in &s;o delicate a Mould: Both our bodily and mental Powers are fitted to ad|mini&s;ter to our Enjoyments, and are by no means contrived to be the Cau&s;e of Fretfulne&s;s, and a pe|tulant Peevi&s;hne&s;s, which &s;erve only to &s;our the Tem|per, and become trouble&s;ome and di&s;agreeable in Society.</P>
<P>To define a true Ta&s;te may be unnece&s;&s;ary at pre&s;ent, as it has been often done by abler Pens; but, I believe, it will be judged pertinent to the Subject in Hand, to give the Reader &s;ome De&s;cription of it. Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> ob|&s;erves, that many ab&s;tract Ideas are expre&s;&s;ed by Terms taken from the Perceptions of our external Sen&s;es, &s;uch as to <HI>imagine, comprehend, conceive, adhere,</HI> &amp;c. which are
<PB N="286" REF="297">all applied to Modes of thinking. In like Manner, the Term now in Que&s;tion is derived from the Sen&s;ation of our Palate, which we call Ta&s;te, and, on account of &s;ome Similitude in the Operation, i applied to the in|tellectual Faculty by Men of Imagination in all Lan|guages; the Information given to the Mind being in both Ca&s;es rapid and in&s;tantaneous, without waiting for the more cool and deliberate Sentence of Reflection.</P>
<P>Hence naturally ari&s;es a Di&s;tinction between Ta&s;te and Judgment; which are often u&s;ed as &s;ynonymous Expre&s;&s;ions, but are notwith&s;tanding very different in them&s;elves. I believe, many of my Readers know Peo|ple among their Acquaintance, who, if you lay a Pic|ture before them, upon mature Deliberation, and after comparing lei&s;urely the Copy with their own Ideas of Nature, can pronounce the Piece to be like, without manife&s;ting any particular Reli&s;h or Plea&s;ure, which is always a concomitant Circum&s;tance with the Man of Ta&s;te. It is he that enters into the Spirit and Stile of an Author, &s;ees in an In&s;tant how he &s;elects the Circum|&s;tances in a De&s;cription, enjoys the Turn of his Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, and his Art in &s;eizing the Pa&s;&s;ions; and it is upon a Review of what thus &s;trikes the Mind, that the Critics of all Ages have been able to lay down Rules for Ta&s;te; as Theories of Vi&s;ion are framed from an Exa|mination of the Organs of Sight, and the Manner in which external Objects operate upon them; and hence the <HI>French</HI> Wits have told us, that nothing can be ele|gant, which is not true, upon an Ob&s;ervation that the Mind turns with Di&s;ta&s;te from any Thing, which con|tradicts its own Ideas.</P>
<P>It is recorded of <HI>Marcus Antoninus,</HI> that he acknow|ledged it to the Gods as a peculiar Felicity, that he had not cultivated his Ta&s;te for Works of Imagination, for fear they might have detained him from Objects of higher Importance; but, for my Part, I cannot help wondering that he did not rather thank Heaven for the
<PB N="287" REF="298">elegant Turn be&s;towed upon him, as it is certain that, under due Regulation, a ju&s;t Ta&s;te is a con&s;tant Source of the mo&s;t refined Gratifications.</P>
<P>With this Talent, a Man may retire into his Clo&s;et, and there enjoy a more delicious Repa&s;t, and better Company, than can be met with in any modern A&s;|&s;embly. <HI>Homer</HI> never denies him&s;elf to any Acquaintance, and <HI>Virgil</HI> is always ea&s;y of Acce&s;s, whether you de|light in &s;ublime De&s;cription, or the &s;ofter Beauties of rural Imagery. A Man may take as much Liberty with <HI>Horace</HI> as his intruding Friend did in the <HI>Via Sacra,</HI> free from the &s;ame Imputation of Impertinence; and, without the Expence of a <HI>Remi&s;e,</HI> you may vi&s;it <HI>Boileau, La Fontaine, Vollaire,</HI> and the polite&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> Nation. Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> is always ready to &s;hake your Sides with Humour; you may conver&s;e with <HI>Pope</HI> without hearing him complain of Head-Aches; and if you a&s;pire to the Company of a Mini&s;ter of State, you may retire with <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> into the Cabinet, there find him di&s;|clo&s;ing the &s;ecret Springs of Policy, or receive a Clue from him to guide you through the Maze of Hi&s;tory. In &s;hort, to a Mind well harmonized, all Nature wears a plea&s;ing A&s;pect, and the Tran&s;ition is ea&s;y from a Re|li&s;h for external Beauty, and the Plea&s;ures ari&s;ing from Poetry, Eloquence, and the Arts of Imitation, to a Love for moral Perfection and the Dignity of Character.</P>
<P>This is the Sentiment of <HI>Cicero</HI> in the Words of my Motto, and it is enforced by the Author of <HI>The Plea&s;ures of Imagination,</HI> in &s;uch an exqui&s;ite Strain of Poetry, that I mu&s;t beg Leave to conclude with tran&s;cribing the Pa&s;&s;age. Speaking of a Man of Ta&s;te, he has the fol|lowing Lines.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Not a Breeze</L>

<P>_WHenever any particular Object becomes the principal and favourite Idea of a Man's Imagination, it derives from thence an ad|ventitious Air of Importance, and attracts his Attention as irre&s;i&s;tibly, as Matters of the highe&s;t Moment. Of this Truth I met an egregious Proof in an Acquaintance of mine, who happened to fall into my Company a few Days &s;ince at the Coffee|hou&s;e. While great Numbers of our Countrymen are bu&s;ied in Enquiries after Mr. <HI>Keene</HI>'s Negoti|ations at the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> to prevent the Depre|dations of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchantmen; while &s;ome are intere&s;ted in the Election a of King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and others employed in a Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the Naturalization Act; this Gentleman is entirely ab|&s;tracted in his Speculations, and concerns him&s;elf in
<PB N="290" REF="301">the Regulation of an imaginary World with more Soli|citude, than any Politician in what is immediately con|nected with the Intere&s;t of his Country.</P>
<P>Upon my a&s;king him the ordinary Que&s;tion, <Q><HI>What News?</HI></Q> He replied, <Q>There is &s;omething in Agi|tation, Sir, in both Kingdoms, but it has not as yet tran&s;pired; though I have a &s;ecret Channel for Intel|ligence, and, I believe, I am pretty well in the Se|cret; both Cabinets endeavour to &s;uppre&s;s their In|tentions, but my Information comes from the Board of Green Cloth.</Q> &mdash; At this Expre&s;&s;ion my Friend perceived me &s;omewhat &s;urprized, and he therefore thought proper to explain him&s;elf, <Q>The Board of Green-Cloth, Sir,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>is a metaphorical Term I generally make u&s;e of to &s;ignify what is vul|garly call the <HI>Green Room;</HI> perhaps you never &s;aw the <HI>Green-Room;</HI> it is the Place where the Performers rendezvous during the Play, and for &s;ome Time after it; that of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> is in the Form of an Ob|long, and I'll give you a particular De&s;cription of it.</Q></P>
<P>Here I was reduced to a Nece&s;&s;ity of mentioning, that it would be &s;uper&s;luous to give him&s;elf &s;o much Trouble, as that Place was as well known to me as the Coffee-Room we were in; which Hint I judged not improper, as I knew that a violent Propen&s;ity to De|&s;cription was one of my Friend's Singularities, and that he is never &s;o compleatly happy as when an Opportu|nity offers for him to di&s;play his florid Talents for this Embelli&s;hment of Conver&s;ation. Upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions I have frequently ob&s;erved his Eye &s;parkle with a pe|culiar Brillancy, which never fails to be extingui&s;hed whenever he is checked in his Career, as was the Ca&s;e with him at pre&s;ent. After looking &s;erious for &s;ome Time, he rea&s;&s;umed his Di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;<Q>The Theatrical World, Sir, is nothing now to what it was formerly; the People are infatuated with <HI>Garrick;</HI>
<PB N="291" REF="302">&mdash; He has introduced a new Ta&s;te entirely; I could wi&s;h I had lived in the Days, when <HI>Lun</HI> was in his meridian Splendor; Sir, I have been delighted at a Recital of the many Feats he u&s;ed to perform. Don't you think it mu&s;t have given the quicke&s;t Sen&s;ations of Surprize to an Audience, to &s;ee him in the Cha|racter of <HI>Harlequin,</HI> making his E&s;cape into the Tub &mdash;(the Tub, Sir, is the Box over the Stage Door) &mdash;and when he was clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by his Enemies, it mu&s;t have been delightful to perceive him dart, as quick as an Arrow to its de&s;tined Mark, or with the Celerity of a Bird in the Air, from the Place, where the whole Hou&s;e imagined him de&s;titute of the Means of an E&s;cape, into the oppo&s;ite Box, and there &s;tand laughing at his Pur&s;uers. There was al|ways &s;uch an Exertion in his nervous Sy&s;tem, that&mdash; I don't know whether you ever &s;aw an Anatomy&mdash; but I can lend you an Author upon the Animal Oeco|nomy, from whom it will appear manife&s;tly, upon the cleare&s;t Principles, how this was performed. It would a&s;toni&s;h you to hear the &s;everal Accidents he met with; when he was locked in Arm over Arm, with another at the Top of a Scene, they both fell down, cla&s;ped in each other's Embrace; and how do you think he e&s;caped?&mdash;with an amazing Agility he turned his Fellow-performer under him, &s;o that he came down quite ea&s;y, while the other broke his Collar-bone.&mdash;Perhaps you never would be able to gue&s;s how many Steps he made in running in a cir|cular Manner round the Stage; three Thou&s;and Steps, Sir&mdash;the Movement of each Leg was &s;o &s;mall and quick, that in going the Length of one Foot, he minced it &s;o as to make three hundred Steps&mdash;look ye Sir <HI>(wetting his Finger)</HI> here's a Circle on the Table; and now &s;uppo&s;e my two Fingers to be his Legs, then conceive them to move in this Manner &mdash;you &s;ee there's nothing &s;o ea&s;y&mdash;they may &s;ay
<PB N="292" REF="303">what they will of the Hero of <HI>Drury Lane;</HI> he only imitates Men, whereas the <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Chief con|verts him&s;elf into a wild Bea&s;t, a Bird, or a Serpent with a long Tail and what not. I believe there will be &s;ome|thing done next Winter; there is a Scheme on Foot to work the little Fellow. The Thing is, we are to have an old Pantomime Entertainment, new vamped, with an additional Scene of a <HI>Scythian</HI> Winter-Piece, which I am convinced will draw the whole Town after it. There are already &s;everal Agents &s;ent to <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> to purcha&s;e a &s;ufficient Number of Bears, and a large Quantity of Ice is now actually making. The Ice, Sir, will be di&s;po&s;ed on the Stage in large Rocks, and the Bea&s;ts will be &s;ent on &s;hivering amid&s;t the hoary Fro&s;ts; in one Part of the Scene the Sun will be di&s;|covered, but &s;horn of his Beams, as <HI>Milton</HI> has it; the rigid Fro&s;t will be impervious to his Rays, and you will &s;ee the Lightning play upon the impa&s;&s;ive Ice. There will al&s;o be exhibited at a Di&s;tance a lofty Mountain, from who&s;e Summit will come roaring down a tumultuous Cataract, loud, and impetuous in its Cour&s;e, and at the Bottom will be placed a Re|&s;ervoir to collect the ru&s;hing Torrent, where it will form it&s;elf into a &s;mooth expan&s;ive River, which is to glide off in the Sight of the Spectators. There will al&s;o be &s;ituated on the Banks of the River a Man with a Fi&s;hing-Rod, intent upon catching the Tenants of the watery Plain, when on a &s;udden the Au|dience will perceive the Stream arre&s;ted in its Cour&s;e by the Inten&s;ene&s;s of the Fro&s;t, and the Fi&s;herman's Line made a Pri&s;oner for the Remainder of the Sea|&s;on. The Water-fall al&s;o will in&s;tantly be &s;topp'd by the gelid Sea&s;on, and the Spectators will have the Plea&s;ure of perceiving the pendant I&s;icle. This, Sir, will be performed with Ea&s;e, though the Man|ner of its Operation will be imperceptible to the vulgar Eye. But there is no Difficulty in the Thing;
<PB N="293" REF="304">for, as the Torrent is to come down in Sheets of Water, which will be repre&s;ented with a gli&s;tening Kind of Tin, it will be extremely practicable to &s;top the Tin all at once, and in that Ca&s;e the curious will admire the Wonders of the liquid Stone; <HI>liquidi Mi|racula &s;axi,</HI> you know <HI>Claudian</HI> talks of, and to all this will be added &s;everal other Ornaments that will tend greatly to heighten the Entertainment.</Q></P>
<P>The Theatrical Projector had gone on thus far with|out Interruption, and upon my offering to make &s;ome Animadver&s;ions upon his Scheme, he altered the Po|&s;ition of his Features, looked grave, and in a &s;hort Time walked off without &s;aying a Word. The Rea&s;on of this I take to be, that my Friend is never happy, but when the Company is attentive to his own Narratives. Be that as it will, I mu&s;t own for my Part, that I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee <HI>Harlequin</HI> bani&s;hed from all polite Au|diences to his native <HI>Sadler's-Wells,</HI> to &s;ee <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> triumph over every Heart, and to view both Play|hou&s;es &s;ucceeding by the Force of ju&s;t acting, rational Performances, and a &s;imple Conformity to Nature, which would introduce &s;uch a Reformation in our Di|ver&s;ions, as to render them of public Utility to the Morals of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> People.</P>

It &s;eems he was &s;topped on <HI>Stamford-Hill</HI> by a &s;ingle Highwayman, who rifled his Pockets, and took from him the following Effects: Two Guineas in Gold, and &s;ome Silver; a clean Shirt, a white Handkerchief, and a Pair of Silk Stockings out of one Coat Pocket;

In this Vehicle they &s;trolled about from Place to Place, under the Di|rection of <HI>The&s;pis,</HI> who was their Manager; they had their Faces all bedaubed with Lees of Wine, which, no doubt, contributed not a little with other contingent Circum&s;tances to render them ridiculous. And indeed, in this Situation of the Drama, it is no Wonder that they were looked upon as a Set of Low Fellows. By in&s;en&s;ible Degrees Matters were improved to greater Elegance, though the old Opprobrium &s;till continued to adhere to the Performers, and perhaps their own Way of Life, their own Morals, their own Behaviour, and the Appearance they every where made, de&s;erved, that the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion &s;hould not be effaced. By the
<PB N="296" REF="307">&s;ame Means, the Prejudice has been derived down from Age to Age, and till within the&s;e few Years pa&s;&s;ed, the Laws, which public Opinion had e&s;tabli&s;hed, con|tinued in full Force, till at Length they were repealed in Favour of the Few, who&s;e Life and Conver&s;ation &s;hould de&s;erve it. Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> talking of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Time, ob&s;erves, <Q>that as the be&s;t Playhou&s;es were then Inns and Taverns (the <HI>Globe,</HI> the <HI>Hope,</HI> the <HI>Red Bull,</HI> the <HI>Fortune,</HI> &amp;c.) &s;o the Top of the Profe&s;&s;ion were then meer Players, not Gentlemen of the Stage: They were led into the Buttery by the Steward, not placed at the Lord's Table, or Lady's Toilet; and con&s;equently were entirely deprived of tho&s;e Advan|tages they now enjoy, in the familiar Conver&s;ation of our Nobility, and an Intimacy (not to &s;ay Dearne&s;s) with People of the fir&s;t Condition.</Q></P>
<P>Certain it is, the Sentiments of Mankind have been very much changed in this Re&s;pect of late Years, and indeed, in all Ages and among all Men of Sen&s;e, the Prejudice never had much Weight, whenever there ap|peared one ab&s;tracted from the common Herd, who, be|&s;ides the other Qualities requi&s;ite in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a good Under&s;tanding, adorned and embelli&s;hed with Mode&s;ty, Decency, and good Manners. Thus we find among the <HI>Romans, Ro&s;cius,</HI> the Player, was held in general E&s;teem by all Men of Ta&s;te and Re|finement. <HI>Cicero</HI> loved him living, and at his Decea&s;e paid an immortal Tribute to his Memory. He omitted no Opportunity of celebrating his Name, and in one of his mo&s;t famous Orations, <Q>Who is there, &s;ays he, among us of &s;o rude and unfeeling a Di&s;po&s;ition, as not to have been very &s;en&s;ibly affected at the Death of <HI>Ro&s;cius,</HI> who though he died in an extreme old Age, on Account of his excellent Art, and his every Elegance de&s;erved to be exempt from that Debt of human Nature." "<HI>Quis no&s;trum tam animo agre&s;ti ac
<PB N="297" REF="308">duro fuit, ut Ro&s;cii morte nuper non commoveretur? Qui cum e&s;&s;et &s;enex mortuus, tamen propter excellentem artem, ac venu&s;tatem, videbatur omnin&ograve; mori non debui&s;&s;e.</HI></Q> Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> was al&s;o the Friend, the Companion, the Fa|vourite of a Set of Men, who were the chief Honour to our Country; <HI>Dryden, Pope, Rowe, Addi&s;on, Congreve, Steel,</HI> and the famous Doctor <HI>Radcliffe</HI> were the Per&s;on|ages that received him with open Arms; and if Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> &s;hould never be able to boa&s;t &s;uch an exalted Acquaintance, it is for this only Rea&s;on, becau&s;e it is hardly to be expected, that &s;uch a Set of Men will again appear together.</P>
<P>A compleat Actor appears &s;o &s;eldom in the World, that I do not wonder, whenever a <HI>real Prometheus</HI> with true Fire &s;tarts up among us, at the Tribute of Admi|ration and Applau&s;e, which is paid to him by the ge|neral Con&s;ent; and &s;o many Requi&s;ites are nece&s;&s;ary to form one, who can thus extort the public Approbation, that, I own, I &s;hould not be &s;urprized if this Art ro&s;e much higher in the Eyes of the Judicious. There are many external Accompli&s;hments, which in other Pro|fe&s;&s;ions may be di&s;pen&s;ed with, but the fine Performer mu&s;t have a well formed Per&s;on, a graceful Deport|ment, a well turned Face, a ju&s;t Di&s;po&s;ition of Fea|tures, and an Eye expre&s;&s;ive of the various &s;ubtile Move|ments of the Mind; he mu&s;t have improved the Air of his whole Per&s;on by an Habitude and Intercour&s;e with Gentlemen; and he mu&s;t add to all this a Voice, not only to articulate each Syllable di&s;tinctly and with Pre|ci&s;ion, but al&s;o to deliver each Sentence with Grace and Harmony.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e external Qualifications, what a Train of mental Endowments is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary? A good Under&s;tanding cultivated by a liberal Education, a true Ta&s;te and Reli&s;h for all the Beauties in an Author, a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of every Pa&s;&s;age, and the Idea appropriated to each Word, a thorough Knowledge of Character;
<PB N="298" REF="309">an Imagination warm and alive to each fine Stroke of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oet; a Sen&s;ibility of Temper, properly &s;u&s;ceptible of each Pa&s;&s;ion the Writer addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to, and a Power of exciting that Pa&s;&s;ion in others. What and how great that Power is, the following Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Ham|let</HI> will better convey to the Reader, than any Thing I have to offer on the Subject. <Q>Is it not mon|&s;trous that this Player here, but in a Fiction, in a Dream of Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;hould &s;o force his Soul to his own Conceit, that from her working all his Vi&s;age wanned Tears in his Eyes, Di&s;traction in his A&s;pect, a broken Voice, and a Function &s;uiting with Forms to his Conceit?</Q></P>
<P>From this Account, I apprehend, it mu&s;t ap|pear, that this Profe&s;&s;ion &s;hould be reckoned among the liberal and imitative Arts, and at the &s;ame Time I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that it cannot be thought too &s;lightly of in tho&s;e, who repeat the mere Words in a vacant un|feeling Manner, or who&s;e Art con&s;i&s;ts in a wry Mouth, or a Burn on the Jaw. But when every Look, Ge&s;ture, and Action is governed by the Soul, when the Imagi|nation is wrapped, and the Audience catch it by Con|tagion; when the Arti&s;t imparts new Motions to our Spirits, wrings the Soul with fancied Grief, and fills us with imaginary Terrors, then we perceive a Genius which cannot be too much admired. I have often la|mented that the Poverty of our Language does not afford a Term &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;uch a Performer from the re&s;t of his Fraternity; as I al|ways &s;tudy to avoid Confu&s;ion in my Ideas, I en|deavour to &s;eperate them in my own Mind by Words which appear to me to be be&s;t appropriated to them, and, till a better Di&s;tinction is pointed out, I would chu&s;e to call a Per&s;on, &s;uch as I have de&s;cribed, an Imi|tator or an Actor, and he, who pretends to the Art without any Knowledge of Nature, &s;hould be &s;et down a <HI>mere Player.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="310">In this Sen&s;e Mr. <HI>Barry</HI> will always be accounted a fine Actor, and Mrs. <HI>Cibber</HI> an Actre&s;s of irre&s;i&s;tible &s;kill.

<P>_I HAVE been ever highly delighted with the Pa&s;&s;age, which I have this Day &s;elected from <HI>Virgil</HI> for a Motto to my Paper. They are the Words of <HI>Evander,</HI> when he is re|ceiving the pious <HI>Trojan</HI> Prince under his humble, but ho&s;pitable Roof. If I remember right, Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> was an Admirer of the beautiful Simplicity of this Addre&s;s, As I have his Volumes at Hand, I &s;hall here tran&s;cribe the Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<Q><L>Honour our annual Fea&s;t, and take your Seat</L>
<L>With friendly Welcome at a homely Treat.</L></Q>
<P>This Sentiment, however, &s;hort the Tran&s;lation may be is highly admirable in the Original, and &s;hould be im|pre&s;&s;ed in very lively and deep Characters on every Man's Heart who is de&s;irous of &s;haring the &s;ocial Plea&s;ures of Life.</P>
<P>Content is mo&s;t certainly the &s;ure&s;t Source of an in|ternal Happine&s;s; it not only reconciles a Per&s;on to
<PB N="301" REF="312">him&s;elf, but al&s;o to tho&s;e with whom he conver&s;es. To u&s;e <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Phra&s;e, it is the chief Nouri&s;her in Life's Fea&s;t, and when giddy Mirth and Noi&s;e have &s;ub&s;ided, this keeps on an equal Tenor, and if it never ri&s;es very high, it has at lea&s;t this Advantage, that it does not ebb &s;o low as to leave Shoals and Rocks di&s;|covered. Mirth may properly be called an <HI>Aurora Borealis;</HI> whereas Good Humour, like a fixed Star, &s;heds a con&s;tant Stream of Light, which, if it does not dazzle, has at lea&s;t at all Times a chearing Influence.</P>
<P>If good Humour has this Advantage annexed to it, Di&s;content mu&s;t certainly be attended with many poig|nant Inconveniences; In the &s;ame Proportion that Ea&s;e endears and enlivens our Days, its Rever&s;e mu&s;t bring on each Morn in a Turbulence of Clouds; the Spirits are perpetually &s;inking, and all the U&s;es of this World, as the Poet has it, &s;eem to him weary, &s;tale, flat, and unprofitable. The Infection is always rankling in his Brea&s;t, and he lives in an uncea&s;ing State of Ho&s;tility with him&s;elf and his Neighbours. This by Degrees grows into a fixed Habit, and then a lowering invariable Gloom hangs over his Mind, and as he does not feel any Peace in his own inward Frame, he is not tender about the Un|ea&s;ine&s;s he may create in another's Brea&s;t. He there|fere gives an unlimited Vent to his Sullenne&s;s, and is ever finding fault with every Thing around him.</P>
<P>There is one Circum&s;tance which has a Kind of Ten|dency to alleviate this Perver&s;ity of Di&s;po&s;ition, and that is, that the Propen&s;ity to Satyr, which this Sul|lenne&s;s gives the Mind, is often the Occa&s;ion of &s;tarting new and uncommon Remarks. We &s;ometimes hear from the&s;e Kind of Humouri&s;ts Strokes of a pee|vi&s;h Plea&s;antry, which are not unentertaining; and as the&s;e People are ever fond of exhibiting a <HI>Caricature</HI> of their Acquaintances, we now and then receive &s;ome Sketches or Pictures in Miniature, in which the Colouring and the Drapery are &s;o whim&s;i|&s;ically
<PB N="302" REF="313">imagined, that we really derive no &s;mall De|gree of Diver&s;ion from their extravagant Turn. But notwith&s;tanding this Degree of Mirth which they invo|luntarily excite, it does not &s;ufficiently compen&s;ate for the Trouble they give for the mo&s;t part. A Man, who can find no Reli&s;h in any Thing, &s;hould be bani&s;hed from Society; he &s;hould be &s;ent to an Infirmary of <HI>Valetudinarians,</HI> and there be confined until he purges away his ill Humours, or until Rea&s;on di&s;pels the Mi&s;t which has ob&s;cured his Intellects.</P>
<P>The &s;ure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> way of plea&s;ing in Company, is for a Man to be plea&s;ed inwardly; and he that is not &s;o, &s;hould retire and brood over his Unea&s;ine&s;s, and not become trouble&s;ome, or invade the Harmony of Society. I cannot help con&s;idering this fixed and permanent ill Humour as a Kind of <HI>Black-Jaundice,</HI> through the dark Medium of which every Thing that pa&s;&s;es takes a Tinc|ture. I know a Per&s;on at pre&s;ent who has been in a <HI>Black-Jaundice</HI> for many Years, and he is &s;till &s;uffered by his Friends to go about finding Fault, perpetually di&s;|&s;atisfied, di&s;contented, and grumbling. <HI>Sullen</HI> is his Name, and he is known by his Acquaintance to be one of the greate&s;t Mal-Contents in the Creation.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mr. <HI>Sullen</HI> wakes in a Morning, if he has had a good Night's Repo&s;e, <Q>Damn it, he cries, what made me over&s;leep my&s;elf.</Q>&mdash;He then rings his Bell; the Servant has not Wings, and of cour&s;e does not fly to him; Mr. <HI>Sullen</HI> is then tempted to throw &s;omething at the Scoundrel's Head. The next Thing the Servant is ordered to do, he performs with the utmo&s;t Alacrity, <Q>Sirrah! Ra&s;cal! cries <HI>Sullen,</HI> are you mad?&mdash;May be you're drunk this Morning already?&mdash;Can't you do your Bu&s;ine&s;s with a little Di&s;cretion?&mdash;You Blockhead!</Q>&mdash;He then &s;eats him|&s;elf to Breakfa&s;t; his Tea is intolerable, the <HI>India</HI> Com|pany &s;hould be all &s;hot dead, like &s;o many Thieves; they have monopolized the Trade, and never import
<PB N="303" REF="314">a Grain of real Tea&mdash;And tho&s;e <HI>Creols</HI> too, and be damned to them! they &s;end us nothing but Molo&s;&s;es for Sugar.</P>
<P>One of tho&s;e Gentlemen invited him the other Day to a Turtle-Fea&s;t. The Turtle was of a very great Size and accounted extremely fine, by the Connoi&s;&s;eurs in this Sort of Eating; it was dre&s;&s;ed at the Owner's Country-Hou&s;e by the mo&s;t &s;kilful Cook in <HI>London.</HI> <Q>P&s;haw!

<P>In this Manner does <HI>Sullen</HI> torment him&s;elf, and with the Affectation of finer Feelings than his Neigh|bours, he perver&s;ely makes him&s;elf unhappy. Mr. <HI>Sullen</HI> once pa&s;&s;ed a Week in the Country, where I happened to be; he grumbled like a Ma&s;tiff in the great Yard all the Time he continued there; and, after his Departure, the Servant found in his Room the following

<P>_WHEN <HI>Virgil's Aeneas</HI> and his Friend <HI>Achates</HI> were entering the Town, which <HI>Dido</HI> was rai&s;ing, <HI>Venus</HI> diffu&s;ed a Cloud around her favourite Son, in order to &s;ecure him from every human Eye, and protect him from the Inconveniences to which he might be liable, if &s;een by the Inhabitants. This parental Care proved very u&s;eful to the Hero, and we find &s;ome|thing like it is practi&s;ed by <HI>Mother Dulne&s;s,</HI> who never fails to manife&s;t a tender concern for her cho&s;en Sons, and accordingly they are often enveloped in a Cloud of Ob|&s;curity, which no Ray of Light can pierce, and thereby they are enabled to proceed in their Works of Dark|ne&s;s, without Lett or Mole&s;tation. But though there is this Similitude in the Fate of the Favourites of the <HI>Cloud-compelling Queen of Dullne&s;s,</HI> and the Offspring of <HI>Venus,</HI> it is ob&s;ervable, that there is a very wide Difference in the Conduct of both. The latter, we are told, admired as he journeyed on, the Indu&s;try and La|bour of the People, the Plan of their Town, and the Noblene&s;s of their Streets. He was highly plea&s;ed with the Magnificence of the Structures, and the Time he &s;pent in &s;urveying the Pieces of Painting in their Temple, &s;hewed he had a Ta&s;te for the fine Arts. But the <HI>Grub-&s;treet Race,</HI> behold with Envy the learned In|du&s;try of Genius, and from their hidden Place of Ob|&s;curity their Malice is daily levelled at tho&s;e, who they know cannot detect their covered Malice, and &s;uperior Merit is the Mark at which they take their envenomed Aim.
<PB N="307" REF="318">There is however this Comfort remaining, that their Arrows are too blunt to penetrate, and the Mi&s;t, from whence they i&s;&s;ue &s;erves greatly to retard their Force; by which Means they often fall to the Ground with &s;hameful Debility, innocent of the Wound they were intended to inflict.</P>
<P>To drop the long-&s;pun Allegory; the anonymous Li|beller is the Pe&s;t of Society, and it is with Plea&s;ure I have ob&s;erved, that Lampoons of late have fallen Dead-born from the Pre&s;s, without procuring their Au|thors a &s;ingle Dinner. I was the other Day in a Pamphlet-Shop, when a Writer of Defamation came in to enquire after the Succe&s;s of his Production; <Q>Sells middling, Sir, &s;ays the Shop-boy,"&mdash;"We di&s;|po&s;ed of three la&s;t Week</Q>&mdash;I mu&s;t own I felt no little Plea&s;ure at the Author's Di&s;appointment, as I look upon an Itch of Scandal to be the &s;ure&s;t Sign of a de|praved and malevolent Temper, and I am &s;orry to find that it is not always the Con&s;equence of Hunger and Thir&s;t. It a&s;cends higher and flouri&s;hes in high Life, attends the Ladies at their Toilets, give a Reli&s;h to their Tea, a Flavour to their Liqueurs, and every Sum|mer takes a Jant to <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> as con&s;tantly as a Game&s;ter or a Citizen's Wife.</P>
<P>At the la&s;t mentioned Place I happened to &s;pend a Week this Sea&s;on, and was a Witne&s;s to the Mi&s;chief, which was occa&s;ioned by the polite Sonnetteers and Epigrammati&s;ts, who chu&s;e to indulge their Wit, or rather, their Malice upon the amiable Sex. Both tho&s;e who cannot write, and tho&s;e who can, imme|diately upon their Arrival in the&s;e Regions begin to mea&s;ure out Syllables; the vain Poeta&s;ter, while in the Long-Room the Company &s;ip Tea and Scandal, en|vies not the Fame of <HI>Dryden, Pope,</HI> or <HI>Young;</HI> his Brow is adorned with a fancied Laurel, and he enjoys the Pangs he has excited in &s;ome lovely Bo&s;om. As duly as the Morn returns, Malice flies abroad in the Form
<PB N="308" REF="319">of a <HI>Rebus,</HI> a <HI>Madrigal,</HI> a Song, an Epigram, or &s;ome &s;uch ingenious Shape. The general Curio&s;ity is in&s;tantly excited, and every one is impatient to peru&s;e the lying Evidence of Shame. <Q>Do, Colonel, &s;hew it me &mdash;Captain <HI>Flim&s;y,</HI> can't you get me a Sight of it? Do, that's a Dear&mdash;Lord, Ma'am, an't it mighty &mdash;the Creature de&s;erved it&mdash;What Airs &s;he gave her&s;elf?&mdash;And &s;uch a deal of Talk, and &s;o affected &mdash;Do you think her hand&s;ome?&mdash;Well, to be &s;ure &s;he wore a &s;weet Pair of Ruffles Ye&s;terday.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>In this manner is dull Scandal helped about, and the more lovely and innocent the Per&s;on is, who&s;e Hap|pine&s;s is thus invaded, the more agreeable is the Invec|tive; the Satyr &s;harpens, and the Wit refines. <HI>Mu&s;i|dora</HI> has every Grace of Per&s;on, and every elegant Em|belli&s;hment of the Mind; in her Eye, to u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion of a fine Poet, <HI>Love ever wakes and keeps a ve&s;tal Fire,</HI> and her Behaviour carries with it an equal Degree of good Humour and Politene&s;s, flowing from good Sen&s;e and a native Sweetne&s;s of Temper. <HI>Appius</HI> is aukward in his Per&s;on, and di&s;agreeable in his A&s;pect; his Mind is ever on the fret, and, if engaged in a Country-Dance, he is di&s;&s;atisfied with every Thing around him, and is eternally quarrelling with the Mu&s;ic. With the&s;e di&s;agreeable Features of Body and Mind <HI>Appius</HI> applied to <HI>Mu&s;idora</HI> to be his Partner for the Evening, which &s;he declined with great Affability and good Manners, having before experienced the Incon|venience of the Foibles, which have taken Root in this Gentleman's Temper. <HI>Appius</HI> immediately took fire at the imagined Affront, and full of Indignation re|tired home to his Lodging; there he, who never be|fore attempted to tag a Rhyme, in&s;tantly commenced Poet, and the next Day came out the anonymous Stanza, which was however found out to be the Production of <HI>Appius.</HI> The Compo&s;ition was declared very pretty by all the Prudes and Coquettes of the Place, both Spe|cies
<PB N="309" REF="320">of Women being Enemies to <HI>Mu&s;idora,</HI> as &s;he pre|&s;erved a di&s;creet Medium between a giddy Freedom on the one Hand, and the re&s;erve of Hypocri&s;y on the other. The <HI>Ver&s;es</HI> were in a little Time in every body's Hand, and <HI>Appius</HI> was declared to have a very fine Turn for Poetry. The Effect, which this Treatment had on <HI>Mu&s;idora</HI>'s Mind, is not to be de&s;cribed; faded were the Ro&s;es which before were blended with the Lilly, and that Brea&s;t, which was de&s;igned for the Seat of Love, throbbed wild with unea&s;y Pa&s;&s;ions; to pre|vent any further Vexation, her Relations were obliged in a Week's Time to fly from a Place, where Inno|cence and Honour are &s;acrificed to a Je&s;t; where the Men take a wanton Plea&s;ure in Scandal, and where the Fair join in Combination again&s;t Truth and Virtue.</P>
<P>How People can thus become avowed Enemies to their own Happine&s;s, and &s;o univer&s;ally adopt a Cu&s;tom, which certainly would be more honoured in the Breach than the Ob&s;ervance, is to me highly unaccountable. It reminds me of the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s u&s;ed by the Chorus in the Infancy of the Drama, when Malice was &s;ub|&s;tituted in the room of Wit, and run a muck at ho|nourable Families, until a &s;alutary Law &s;topped the Proceeding, and the Chorus, deprived of all further Power of Offence, was condemned to ignominious Si|lence.</P>

<P>_A Series of pointed <HI>Thoughts on various Sub|jects</HI> has been put abroad into the World by &s;everal eminent Writers, and in <HI>France</HI> to this Day, it continues to be a favou|rite Manner of conveying an Author's Sentiments to the Public. The famous <HI>Rochfoucault</HI> &s;ucceeded &s;o well upon this Plan, that he is univer&s;ally admired wherever Wit and Poignancy of Matter are reli&s;hed. This Scheme of Writing indulges a free roving Exerci&s;e of the Mind, as Lord <HI>Shaft&s;bury</HI> expre&s;&s;es it; it &s;ets us free from the Fatigue of pur&s;uing a long and regular Tract of well|concerted Rea&s;oning, and may from its appearing in loo&s;e detached Sentences, &s;eem to the Reader to carry with it no great Difficulty in the Execution, but it is neverthele&s;s as hard as any other Vehicle of In&s;truction, as it rai&s;es a Demand for clo&s;e Sen&s;e and a lively Turn
<PB N="312" REF="323">of Expre&s;&s;ion in almo&s;t every Line. Hence it is, that the Writer already mentioned has been &s;o much cele|brated by People of Ta&s;te, and hence it is, that <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Swift</HI> have thought proper to follow him in this Path of <HI>Satyr.</HI> A very ingenious <HI>French</HI> Writer has al&s;o publi&s;hed, within this &s;hort Time an entire Vo|lume in this Way, abounding in excellent Reflections upon all Occurrences in Life, full of &s;trong Sen&s;e, and highly &s;pirited in the Diction. After having peru&s;ed this Author, my Mind acquired &s;uch a Habit of think|ing in this unconnected Fa&s;hion, that I could not &s;ettle my Thoughts on any one Topic for the Entertainment of my Readers. Wherever I went, whether through the Streets upon ordinary Bu&s;ine&s;s, or into the Play|hou&s;e, where at pre&s;ent, as <HI>Thomp&s;on</HI> has it in his admi|rable Poem called <HI>Winter,</HI>

<L>Othello <HI>rages, poor</HI> Monimia <HI>mourns,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And</HI> Belvidera <HI>pours her Soul in Love;</HI></L></Q> I found my&s;elf con&s;tantly talking Sentences, and I there|fore re&s;olved to commit them to Paper this Day.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS</HEAD>
<P>A Periodical Writer, in order to procure him&s;elf a &s;ufficient Number of Readers, &s;hould endeavour to render his Works agreeable to the various Palates which predominate among the &s;everal Inhabitants of this Metropolis: But though he &s;hould &s;ea&s;on his Papers to the Ta&s;te in vogue, he &s;hould not entirely give up his own Judgment: As <HI>Cowley</HI> has it, The World may &s;o come in a Man's Way, that he may &s;alute it, but he &s;hould not go a whoring after it.</P>
<P>The &s;evere&s;t Critics upon Writing are tho&s;e who know the lea&s;t of it, which is &s;ome Comfort to an Au|thor, who lives in an Age of Envy, Malice, Ill-Nature and Detraction</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="324">Dean <HI>Swift</HI> tell us, that when he was a young Man, he believed that the Re&s;t of the World re&s;embled him|&s;elf in talking of nothing but the la&s;t New Play: In this particular <HI>Ranger</HI> is perhaps too much like that great Genius.</P>
<P>When a Set of Book&s;ellers are concerned in a News-Paper, a <HI>Monthly Review,</HI> or a <HI>Magazine,</HI> they take every Opportunity in the &s;aid Productions of prai&s;ing the Works, in which they have a Property them&s;elves, and of decrying every Thing that may prevent an In|crea&s;e of their own Sale. Writers who are ill-u&s;ed by them in this Shape, may enjoy always this Comfort, that were the&s;e People to <HI>poll</HI> in <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> their Votes, upon a <HI>Scrutiny,</HI> would be &s;truck off, as they are only <HI>Copyholders,</HI></P>
<P>You may know what a Gentleman thinks of you, by the Behaviour of his Servants, while they wait at Table. The&s;e People are always &s;uch &s;incere Friends to their Ma&s;ter, and, have his Honour and Glory &s;o much at Heart, that they generally place their Affec|tions and Re&s;entments upon the &s;ame Object, unle&s;s their Judgment is hand&s;omely bribed at the Street Door.</P>
<P>On the contrary, you may know what the Waiting-Maid thinks of you, by the Reception you meet with from her Mi&s;tre&s;s; for at pre&s;ent all young Ladies are directed in their Opinions concerning the Men by what Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI> is plea&s;ed to &s;ay at the Toilet, and if &s;he declares, <Q>O Ma'am, he's a fine Man&mdash;I loves to &s;ee him like any Thing</Q>&mdash;or, <Q>Oh! the Fright &mdash;I hate the Sight of him.</Q> You are &s;ure to find the Con&s;equences of it, at the fir&s;t Meeting.</P>
<P>As the World goes, there is generally more <HI>Art</HI> to obtain Succe&s;s, than <HI>Merit</HI> to de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>Sounding Periods and pompous Expre&s;&s;ions no more con&s;titute a beautiful Stile, than &s;truting in <HI>Red Heel</HI> Shoes, and <HI>Gold Clock</HI> Stockings can make a graceful Walk; both may &s;erve to impo&s;e upon the injudicious,
<PB N="314" REF="325">but tho&s;e, who are acquainted with Men and Books, will always think Ea&s;e a very requi&s;ite Quality.</P>
<P>Di&s;cretion has its Bounds as well as all other Virtues; and it degenerates into a Vice, if, like <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Ser|pent, it &s;wallows up the re&s;t.</P>
<P>A MOTTO for the <HI>JEWS;</HI></P>
<Q>&mdash;Nos alia ex aliis in Fata vocamur.</Q>
<P>When I reflect on the late <HI>Marriage-Act,</HI> I cannot help crying out with the Poet;</P>
<Q>Cur&s;e on all Laws, but tho&s;e which Love has made.</Q>
<P>It is boldly remarked by a very good <HI>French</HI> Writer, that a King who does not keep a Mi&s;tre&s;s is highly e&s;ti|mable, provided he does not become a Bigot through too much Devotion.</P>
<P>Politicians have ob&s;erved, that <HI>England</HI> can never be undone but by a Parliament, if that be true, what are the Addre&s;&s;es from Candidates to their Electors, but &s;o many Petitions to let them have a Hand in <HI>Naturali|zation-Acts, Jew-Bills,</HI> Taxes, and in &s;hort the RUIN of their COUNTRY?</P>
<P>The &s;ure&s;t Way of ama&s;&s;ing overgrown Riches, is by a due Government or rather Suppre&s;&s;ion of a Man's own Pa&s;&s;ions, and artfully admini&s;tering to the Grati|fication of other People's.</P>
<P>It is much more difficult to HEAR in Company, than to SPEAK; Every one is willing to do the latter, but few have Politene&s;s enough to do the former, though it &s;erves a double Purpo&s;e; it &s;hews our Manners at the &s;ame Time that it improves the Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The late Doctor <HI>Swift</HI> is not generally e&s;teemed as a Man; in this Point the World agrees with the <HI>Dean</HI> him&s;elf, who was always mortified to think him&s;elf of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a Species.</P>

<P><PB N="315" REF="326">Every Age has a peculiar Characteri&s;tic to di&s;tingui&s;h it; the la&s;t Century was remarkable for a comic Genius, which &s;ometimes run out into unwarrantable Luxu|riancies, and a Breach of Manners; the pre&s;ent Times have acquired a politer Ta&s;te but cannot produce any Work of Theatrical Humour. The former tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed through an Exce&s;s of Vigour, the latter are decent, but they have that kind of Decency which ari&s;es from a Want of Power, rather than of Will, and &s;hould take for their Motto the De&s;cription of <HI>Eunuchs</HI> in <HI>Terence; Amatores e&s;&s;e eos maximos, &s;ed nihil pote&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>People of the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion frequently &s;pend their Time in envying each other; whereas if they were ac|tuated by <HI>Emulation,</HI> and each would mind his own Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, every Man would find his Account in it; as at a Gaming-Table, the Way is not to be fretting at the Cards you &s;uppo&s;e your Adver&s;ary may have, but to make the be&s;t of your own Hand.</P>
<P>Some People's Di&s;cretion is the Rever&s;e of Charity; it covers a Multitude of Virtues, as the latter does a Multitude of Sins.</P>
<P>It was well &s;aid by a Gentleman at a Coffee-hou&s;e, that the la&s;t Scene of a modern Tragedy is like a Sta|tuary's Yard; the Players are all fixed in Attitudes.</P>
<P>When once a Writer is known, his Enemies all will rail at him, and his Friends will damn him with faint Prai&s;e, becau&s;e he has dared to take the Lead of them. He fares like one who meets with &s;peedy Preferment in the Army; the adver&s;e Part will be &s;ure to &s;hoot at him, and his Brother-Officers will hate him for being put over their Heads.</P>
<P>Religion which &s;hould make us live in Peace and Charity, is the Source of our mo&s;t violent Animo&s;ities, no one being willing to let his Neighbour wor&s;hip the &s;upreme Being according to his own Ideas, and his own Feelings, though each Per&s;on is re&s;olved to u&s;urp that Liberty him&s;elf.</P>

<P>_A Celebrated <HI>French</HI> Critic has given it for a Rule, that every Author &s;hould from Time to Time <HI>&s;acrifice to the Graces;</HI> thereby beautifully in&s;inuating, that Writers &s;hould endeavour to fa&s;hion their Minds into an elegant Way of Thinking, which will be always &s;ure to tran&s;pire into their Compo&s;itions, and will be manife&s;ted by a de|licate Choice of Sentiment and Expre&s;&s;ion. <HI>Ine&s;t fa|cundis gratia dictis</HI> is the Phra&s;e, by which an Author of Ta&s;te has &s;ignified a Poli&s;h and Refinement in a Per|formance; and indeed among the Antients in general, it is this peculiar Grace, this genteel Manner of con|ceiving and expre&s;&s;ing their Thoughts, that has made their Productions the Admiration of Ages; and tho&s;e have been accounted cla&s;&s;ic Writers among the Moderns, who have &s;ucceeded be&s;t in imitating the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Originals.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e Reflections I retired to Re&s;t a few Nights &s;ince, when, in the Hours of Sleep, my bu&s;y Imagina|tion pur&s;ued the &s;ame Track of Contemplation, and pre|&s;ented to me the following Scene. I dreamt that an Order was i&s;&s;ued out from the High Court of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> requiring the immediate Attendance of all the Inhabi|tants of the Place at a SACRIFICE TO THE GRACES, according to an anniver&s;ary In&s;titution in Honour of the Day, on which <HI>Apollo</HI> &s;lew the <HI>Python.</HI> For this Purpo&s;e the three lovely Si&s;ters walked together, interchanging in their Way mutual Glances of Cordiality and Affec|tion,
<PB N="318" REF="329">to an elegant Edifice rai&s;ed by <HI>Inigo Jones;</HI> each had in her Hand Mr. <HI>Hogarth</HI>'s <HI>Analy&s;is of Beauty.</HI> They placed them&s;elves on an eminent Altar in &s;uch amiable Attitudes, as have not been equalled on any of our Theatres, &s;ince the Manager of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Hou&s;e withdrew a certain Lady from the publick Eye.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the <HI>Godde&s;&s;es</HI> were thus prepared for the Solemnity, <HI>Apollo,</HI> in all the Pride of manly Beauty, ad|vanced to the Altar, and paid his Adoration. This done, the Mu&s;es came forward in Proce&s;&s;ion, and, after pro&s;trating them&s;elves in a re&s;pectful Manner, they mixed together in a Dance, and &s;ung Hymns of Prai&s;e in Honour of the Graces. <HI>Ducunt choreas, &amp; carmi|na dicunt.</HI> The whole poetic Region was exhilerated at the Sound, and every Thing, that before looked beautiful, &s;eemed to glow with additional Charms.</P>
<P>This Part of the Ceremony being concluded, a Trumpet &s;ounded three Times, as a Signal for Men of Genius to make their Approach; and in&s;tantly a <HI>Grecian</HI> Band appeared. The mo&s;t remarkable among them were <HI>Homer, Socrates, Plato, Sophocles,</HI> and <HI>Longi|nus; Ari&s;totle</HI> having &s;ent Word that he was engaged in a <HI>Syllogi&s;m,</HI> and could not attend. <HI>Socrates,</HI> who, we are told, called Dancing a Sacrifice to the Graces, im|mediately began a Movement before the Altar, and <HI>Plato</HI> ey'd him with a &s;tedfa&s;t Look. <HI>Longinus,</HI> having acquitted him&s;elf in the due Forms of Veneration, fixed his Attention on <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lucretius</HI> was Leader of the next Divi&s;ion; he thanked the <HI>Graces</HI> for having &s;cattered &s;o many Flowers amid&s;t the Thorns, which &s;hoot up in his Part of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us. Terence,</HI> who was always an <HI>elegant Ob&s;erver of Forms,</HI> &s;eemed to receive great Delight from beholding &s;o much Beauty, and he preferred his Prayer with the utmo&s;t Purity of Diction.</P>
<P>The Po&s;ture in which <HI>Tully</HI> placed him&s;elf recalled
<PB N="319" REF="330">to my Mind the De&s;cription of him in the <HI>Temple of Fame.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Gath'ring his flowing Robe he &s;eem'd to &s;tand,</L>
<L>In Act to &s;peak, and graceful wav'd his Hand.</L></Q>
<P>He declared in a flowing Stile, that <Q>from an Ha|bit of &s;urveying the Beauty of external Objects, the Mind makes an ea&s;y Tran&s;ition to the Fitne&s;s, the Order, and Regularity of its own inward Frame, and from a View of outward Decorum it begins to acquire the &s;ame Correctne&s;s and Elegance in its own Operations; &s;tudiou&s;ly careful not to think or do any Thing unhand&s;omely, from whence re&s;ults that <HI>Grace of Character,</HI> which is, in its very Nature, highly eligible and Prai&s;e worthy.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> came forward with a mode&s;t Mien, and great Regularity in his Motion. He de&s;ired to pa&s;s all his Time with the <HI>Graces</HI> and the <HI>Mu&s;es;</HI> and bowing re|&s;pectfully thanked the <HI>Graces</HI> for that elegant Simpli|city, the <HI>Molle atque facetum,</HI> which they had conferred upon him. He then retired to a laureat Shade, where he almo&s;t hid him&s;elf in illu&s;trious Ea&s;e. <HI>Statius, Lucan,</HI> and <HI>Silius Italicus</HI> endeavoured to walk in the &s;ame Path after him, and &s;ometimes they even aimed at his Foot&s;teps, but an aukward Strut in their Gate ren|dered it impracticable. The Godde&s;&s;es told <HI>Ovid,</HI> that they were &s;orry they could not follow him into Exile. At the Approach of <HI>Horace, Venus,</HI> and all the laughing Loves, &s;miled with peculiar Plea&s;ure. <HI>Tibullus</HI> was received with every Token of Affection, and, be|fore he withdrew, he begged Leave to introduce Mr. <HI>Hammond</HI> to their Pre&s;ence, which was granted, and accordingly Mr. <HI>Hammond</HI> had the Honour of ki&s;&s;ing their Hands.</P>
<P>After this a Pau&s;e en&s;ued in the Rites, occa&s;ioned by the Delay of &s;everal <HI>Monks</HI> and <HI>Fathers,</HI> to whom a Summon had been &s;ent commanding their Attendance.
<PB N="320" REF="331">They were all in a Clu&s;ter at the Foot of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> and they at length returned for an&s;wer, that they did not chu&s;e to wor&s;hip fal&s;e Deities. After &s;uch a Declara|tion, it was with Surprize I beheld a certain <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> lay a&s;ide his Mitre, and venerate the Pagan Godde&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Upon enquiring his Name, I found this Per&s;onage to be the celebrated <HI>Vida.</HI> He was followed by <HI>Era&s;|mus, Strada, Bohours,</HI> and &s;everal <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> who were at length joined by <HI>Boileou,</HI> and <HI>La Fontaine.</HI> The former had a Degree of Severity mixed in his Smiles, and the latter was all Quickne&s;s, Vivacity and Wit. In Imitation of <HI>Tibullus,</HI> they begged Leave to pre&s;ent their Friends, and accordingly, <HI>Garth, Prior,</HI> and <HI>Gay</HI> were introduced.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> and <HI>Milton</HI> came down from the highe&s;t Eminence in <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> to pay their Re&s;pects, but while they were performing their Duty, I ob&s;erved they both rai&s;ed their Heads to look at a Part of the Heavens, where there was a di&s;tant Thunder. <HI>Dryden</HI> had not Money to procure a &s;ufficient Quantity of <HI>Frankincen&s;e,</HI> but the Graces accepted the Intention for the Deed, convinced by &s;everal Touches in his Works that no one had a finer Sen&s;e of Beauty. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> advanced with his Eyes fixed upon <HI>Homer,</HI> who was then in Company with <HI>Virgil;</HI> his Look was thought|ful, but bright, and he delivered him&s;elf in the mo&s;t harmonious Numbers. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> followed clo&s;e at his Heels, and he acquitted him&s;elf in his peculiar Manner of giving good Sen&s;e all the Embelli&s;hments of Ea&s;e and artful Negligence. He ob&s;erved how much Good, Humour added to the Beauty of the <HI>Graces,</HI> and he was plea&s;ed to &s;ee them without any fa&s;hionable Edifice of Hair on their Heads, and free from any enormous Circle of the Hoop.</P>
<P>By this Time a general Whi&s;per began to run thro' all the Ranks, owing (as I &s;oon perceived) to the Ap|pearance of Dr. <HI>Swift,</HI> who approached with <HI>Cadenus</HI>
<PB N="321" REF="332">and <HI>Vane&s;&s;a</HI> in his Hand, as an Offering to the Graces. As he drew nearer, he <HI>&s;ucked in his Cheeks,</HI> and the God|de&s;&s;es turned to each other with a Smile. Upon his ma|king an Apology for &s;ome Strokes in his Works, they a&s;&s;ured him that they could overlook tho&s;e Singularities, on Account of his other admirable Qualities; and they added, that what was formerly granted to <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;hould be al&s;o allowed to him, <HI>viz. To to&s;s about his Dung with an Air of Gracefulne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Lord <HI>Shaft&s;bury</HI> was ready to yield all Veneration to three Godde&s;&s;es, who had always warmed his Fancy with the brighte&s;t Ideas. This noble Writer was &s;uc|ceeded by the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> who by the Way declared him&s;elf an Enemy to all Forms of Wor&s;hip. He avowed at the &s;ame Time, that he was readier to pay Adoration to tho&s;e bright Exi&s;tences, than to the <HI>God</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> or the <HI>God</HI> of <HI>Paul,</HI> on which Topics he ha|rangued with a Roll of Periods, in which, tho' he did not advance the &s;trict Truth, he de&s;erved at lea&s;t to be called, in the Words of a witty Satyri&s;t, a <HI>polite Apo&s;tate from God's Grace to Wit.</HI></P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip withdrew, and I then perceived &s;ome certain modern Periodical Writers entering the Temple. They approached the Altar with a College Mien, and a pompous Affectation of learned Indu&s;try. Though no Charge could be brought again&s;t them for want of Matter, their Stile appeared too elaborate, and their Words frequently formed an <HI>exotic Dialect of adventitious Phra&s;es,</HI> by which Means all Ea&s;e was di&s;carded from their Writings; and where Ea&s;e is wanting, Grace will be always deficient.</P>
<P>Emboldened by the Example of my Brother Wri|ters, methought, I approached the Altar, but I was told by <HI>Euphro&s;yne,</HI> that I advanced with rather too great an Air of Negligence, and the Godde&s;s advi&s;ed me to avoid the Appearance of Thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, while I en|deavoured to be ea&s;y and graceful. I was &s;o &s;tung with
<PB N="322" REF="333">this Reproach, that my Repo&s;e was in&s;tantly di&s;turbed, and, when awakened, I plea&s;ed my&s;elf in the Re|flection that the whole was but a Dream.</P>

<P>Whereas a Report prevailed, that <HI>Crook-fingered Jack</HI> has left off Trade, we can now a&s;&s;ure his Friends, that he only retired to lurk about the Door of <HI>Vauxhall</HI> Gar|dens during the Summer-Sea&s;on, and he intends &s;hortly to return to his Station in the <HI>Piazza, Covent-Garden,</HI> when he will take Care to &s;upply his Cu&s;tomers with <HI>Watches, Handkerchiefs,</HI> &amp;c. at the mo&s;t rea&s;onable Rates.&mdash;</P>

<P>_THE Author, from whom I have &s;elected the Motto of this Day's Paper, was a Poet of great Elegance, as well as a Critic of the mo&s;t refined Ta&s;te. He ob&s;erves in his excellent <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI> that the Genius of Writers is frequently very unequal, their Vigour often exhau&s;ted, and their Spirits &s;unk; as if <HI>Apollo</HI> and the Mu&s;es had quite abandoned the tuneful Brea&s;t; and therefore he advi&s;es every Author, to call off his Mind at proper Sea&s;ons from the Studies he is employed in, in order to wait more propitious Moments, when the Return of the poetic Heat, and the Influence of the God, may render his Productions more animated.</P>
<P>This Precept certainly &s;hould be adhered to by all, who pre&s;ume to lay their Lucubrations before the Pub|lic; but it often happens, that the periodical E&s;&s;ayi&s;t, however inclined he may be to retouch and fini&s;h, is compelled by Nece&s;&s;ity to di&s;mi&s;s the uncorrected Sheet to the Pre&s;s; for though the Town may think they have a Right to an Author's whole Time, and that he &s;hould grow pale at the Midnight Lamp, the better to make a Part of their Tea-Equipage in a Morning, it cannot but often be the Ca&s;e, that Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ome Sort, &s;ocial Connections, and &s;undry various Avoca|tions
<PB N="324" REF="335">&s;hall obtrude them&s;elves, &s;o as to render it im|po&s;&s;ible for a Writer to comply with that Re&s;pect he owes his Readers: for, as it has been wittily &s;aid by Sir <HI>Richard Steel,</HI> an Adventurer in this Way, is like a Man who keeps a Stage-Coach; he mu&s;t &s;et out, whe|ther there are Pa&s;&s;engers or not.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes, &s;ince the Commencement of the <HI>Gray's Inn Journal,</HI> been curious after my own Fame, and on this Account I have often &s;eated my&s;elf in a &s;nug Part of a Coffee-hou&s;e, in Order to collect the Sentiments of the Public concerning the pre&s;ent Wri|ter. Upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions I have ob&s;erved, that no Allowance is made for a temporary Want of Health, an accidental Depre&s;&s;ion of Spirits, to which all Men are liable at Times; and I mu&s;t add, that it is not com|mon for Readers in Coffee hou&s;es to make any Abate|ment of their Severity, on Account of the Humour they may be in them&s;elves, their own want of Ea&s;e, and their u&s;ual Cheerfulne&s;s. I remember to have been damned by a well looking Man, becau&s;e his Wine was bad the Night before, and the Fumes of it were &s;till in his Head; an uxorious Gentleman, who is &s;ometimes a little Henpecked by his Wife, is &s;ure never to reli&s;h me after a Curtain-Lecture; and the Price of Corn at <HI>Bear-Key</HI> has more than once lowered me in the E&s;ti|mation of a &s;olid Citizen. Add to the&s;e accidental Con|tingencies, the great Variety of Ta&s;les, which prevall in every Company, and which it is a moral Impo&s;&s;ibi|lity for any Writer to gratify at once. I have occa&s;ionally entertained the Town with E&s;&s;ays of Plea&s;antry and Humour, and the Con&s;equence is, that it has rai&s;ed a Demand upon me every <HI>Saturday</HI> for an equal Vein of Mirth. Becau&s;e the <HI>Temple of Laverna</HI> has excited a general Laugh, it is a&s;ked upon entering a Coffee-room, <Q>Waiter, has Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> given us any more de|tached Scenes to Day?" "Is there any Thing im|men&s;ly high?" "O! this is again&s;t Suicide, there
<PB N="325" REF="336">is no Fun here,</Q> &s;ays another; and a third exclaims, <Q>P&s;haw! this Man is always laughing&mdash;can't he be &s;erious a little, and give us &s;omething that has Stuff in it&mdash;E&s;&s;ays on Ta&s;te, and Poets, and Humouri&s;ts, and Monkeys, and Stile! Here, Boy, give me the <HI>Gazetteer;</HI> or the <HI>London-Daily Adverti&s;er,</HI> which ever is out of Hand.</Q>&mdash;A Corre&s;pondent, who writes to me from his Hou&s;e near <HI>Litchfield,</HI> begs to know, why I have entirely di&s;carded Politics, and has the follow|ing Paragraph&mdash;<Q>Why won't you have a Fling at the Times?&mdash;A Touch now and then upon the Mi|ni&s;try, and a Stricture upon the Con&s;titution would have a pretty go down with us in the Country.</Q></P>
<P>As it is now con&s;idently afferted that the <HI>Jew-Bill</HI> will be repealed, I have re&s;olved with my&s;elf to be a Tool to no Party whatever, and as to the Care of our Con&s;titution, I heartily recommand it to tho&s;e, who are entru&s;ted with it.</P>
<P>"Videant Con&s;ules, ucquid detrimenti Res Publica capiat."</P>
<P>This Paper was undertaken to contribute, as far as the Author's Time and Abilities would permit him, to the Entertainment or In&s;truction of his Readers; to laugh out of Countenance many of tho&s;e Foibles, which are apt to &s;hoot up in this Metropolis; to amu&s;e the Fair, to promote Decency and good Manners, and to detect Impo&s;tors in Writing, Critici&s;m, and many Situa|tions of Life. That this has &s;ucceeded far beyond his warme&s;t Hopes, he is not backward to acknowledge; he thinks him&s;elf obliged to his candid Readers for the &s;avourable Reception, they have hitherto been plea&s;ed to afford to the Production of his lei&s;ure Hours, and, though he is not inclinable to arrogate to him&s;elf any Vanity on this Head, he is notwith&s;tanding plea&s;ed, in a particular Degree, to find that this, his fir&s;t Attempt, has gone on with growing Reputation, from the fir&s;t Out &s;et, to this pre&s;ent <HI>Saturday,</HI> without anticipating
<PB N="326" REF="337">the public Favour by Pu&s;&s;s in the News-Papers, or by the Addre&s;s of Emi&s;&s;aries, who &s;hould con&s;idently a&s;|&s;ert, that it was to be the joint Labour and Production of &s;ome of the be&s;t Writers of the Age; without a Combination of Book&s;ellers to &s;upport it by a Sub&s;crip|tion, and without the Patronage of any great Man what|ever. The Author always di&s;dained &s;uch little Arti|&s;ices, well knowing, that if he had any Wit to recom|mend him, the Public would return a Degree of Encou|ragement in Proportion to their Entertainment; and on this Account; he has never been &s;o indu&s;trious to in&s;i|nuate, that a very eminent Hand was engaged; that Sir <HI>Gecrge</HI> ***** wrote &s;uch an E&s;&s;ay; that my Lord ***** diverted the Choice Spirits &s;uch a Day; that the la&s;t was very &s;ine, and came from the Honour|able *****; that the Author of ***** contri|buted the exqui&s;ite Entertainment in &s;uch a Piece, and that Mr. ***** the Tran&s;lator of ***** was certainly one of the Gentlemen concerned in it, and that his Stile could be ea&s;ily traced in the re&s;pective Pieces belonging to him.</P>
<P>Without the&s;e Advantages, the <HI>Gray's-Inn Journal</HI> has found the Way to amu&s;e the Town once a Week for twelve Months pa&s;t, and, I may boa&s;t, with perhaps &s;ewer voluntary Supplies than is generally afforded to Authors on the&s;e Occa&s;ions.&mdash;However, as I am not inclined to a&s;&s;ume to my&s;elf any <HI>Prai&s;e,</HI> that my own Conviction does not tell me, is properly mine, I mu&s;t here let the Public know that there is a Per&s;on, to whom I am frequently obliged for all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he can contribute. I &s;hall not mention his Name, as I am per&s;uaded, it would not be agreeable to one of his Mo|de&s;ty and delicate Sen&s;e of Things; thus much I will hint, that this Per&s;onage is no other than the Compo|&s;itor of the Pre&s;s, who, finding that my Occupations will not permit me to revi&s;e the Paper my&s;elf, is kind enough upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions to alter Words and Sen|tences
<PB N="327" REF="338">according to his own Ta&s;te, and whenever a Phra&s;e does not entirely plea&s;e him, the Reader, is &s;ure to &s;ee &s;omething &s;ub&s;tituted in its room; for In&s;tance, I had Occa&s;ion to mention &s;ome Time &s;ince, <HI>a Treaty of Marriage,</HI> which this Gentleman converted into a <HI>Treati&s;e of Marriage,</HI> and the Reader's own Ob&s;er|vation will point out to him &s;everal Elegancies of this Nature upon other Occa&s;ions; all which Embelli&s;h|ments of Stile, I beg, may be invariably attributed to the abovementioned Compo&s;itor of the Pre&s;s, of whom I &s;hall &s;ay no more at pre&s;ent; but as the Printer's Devil is now with me for this Lucubration, I &s;hall conclude with a Return of my &s;incere Thanks to the Public, for the Encouragement they have afforded me during the Cour&s;e of this Volume, with a grateful Sen&s;e of which I here take my Leave, and remain un|til next <HI>Saturday,</HI> the candid Readers,</P>
