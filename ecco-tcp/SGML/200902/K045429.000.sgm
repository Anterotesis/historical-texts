<P>All &s;eemed to go on &s;wimmingly, for he had
<PB N="7" REF="6">yet no trial. He began to think with triumph what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mean life he had e&s;caped from in the old quarrel|&s;ome family, and what a happy, honourable life he &s;hould have in the army. <HI>O there was no life like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he life of a &s;oldier.</HI></P>
<P>In a &s;hort time, however, war broke out, his regiment was one of the fir&s;t which was called out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o actual and hard &s;ervice.

<P>He now found, when it was too late, that all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eld-days he u&s;ed to attend, all the evolutions and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xerci&s;es which he had ob&s;erved the &s;oldiers to go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hrough in the calm times of peace and &s;afety, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nly meant to fit, train, and qualify them, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctual &s;ervice which they were now &s;ent out to per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orm by the command of the <HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>The truth is, William often complained when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ere was no real hard&s;hip to complain of; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e common troubles of life fell out pretty much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ike to the <HI>great family</HI> which William had left, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;oldiers in the <HI>King's army.</HI> But the &s;pirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f obedience, di&s;cipline, and &s;elf-denial of the latter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">emed hard&s;hips to one of William's loo&s;e turn of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ind.
