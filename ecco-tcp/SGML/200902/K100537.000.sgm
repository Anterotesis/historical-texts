<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the&s;e poetical Attempts, begs Leave to &s;ay, that &s;he &s;hould not have printed them, but that &s;he is precluded from all Hopes of ever &s;eeing the Tragedy brought upon the Stage, by there having been two &s;o lately on the &s;ame Subject. If her's &s;hould be found to have any greater Re&s;emblance to the two repre&s;ented, than the Same|ne&s;s of the Story made unavoidable, of which &s;he is not con&s;cious, it mu&s;t have been accidental on her &s;ide, as there are many Per&s;ons, of very di&s;tin|gui&s;hed Rank, and unque&s;tionable Veracity, who &s;aw her's in Manu&s;cript before the others appeared, and will witne&s;s for her, that &s;he has taken no advan|tage of having &s;een them. She mu&s;t here do Mr. <HI>Cri&s;p</HI> the Ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that any Re&s;emblance mu&s;t have been equally accidental on his part, as he neither did, nor could &s;ee her <HI>Virginia</HI> before his own was play'd;
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> having declined reading her's, till Mr. <HI>Cri&s;p's</HI> was publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>She is &s;en&s;ible of the Danger of appearing in Print, and of the many Imperfections in the&s;e Pieces; but hopes, her Sex, and the early Time of Li'e at which mo&s;t of them were wrote, will plead her Excu&s;e; &s;he a&s;ks no more, than to be read with the fame Candor and Indulgence with which &s;he her&s;elf reads the Productions of others.</P>
<P>One thing more &s;he begs Leave to &s;ay, that &s;he was greatly encouraged to this Publication, by the favora|ble Reception three Odes of her's met with, which were in&s;erted in a weekly Paper called <HI>The Old Maid:</HI> as this Volume may po&s;&s;ibly come into the Hands of Per&s;ons who are Strangers to the Paper, &s;he has re|printed tho&s;e Odes with the others.</P>
<P>And now, invoking the Powers for friendly Gales, &s;he ventures to launch her little Bark into the wide Sea of Critici&s;m, and <Q>Trembling quits the Shore.</Q></P>
