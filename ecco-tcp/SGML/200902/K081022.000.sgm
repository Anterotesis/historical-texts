<BYLINE>By an Unknown Hand. Spoken by Mrs. CIBBER.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>NEWS! News! good Folks, rare News, and you &s;hall know it&mdash;</L>
<L>I've got Intelligence about our Poet!</L>
<L>Who do you think be is?&mdash;You'll never gue&s;s;</L>
<L>An <HI>IRISH BRICKLAYER,</HI> neither more or le&s;s.</L>
<L>And now the Secret's out, you cannot wonder,</L>
<L>That in commencing Bard he made a Blunder.</L>
<L>Has be not left the Better for the Wor&s;e,</L>
<L>In quitting Solid Brick for empty Ver&s;e?</L>
<L>Can he believe th' Example of <HI>Old Ben,</HI></L>
<L>Who chang'd (like him) the Trowel for the Pen,</L>
<L>Will in his Favour move your Critic Bowels?</L>
<L>You rather wi&s;h, mo&s;t Poct's Pons were Trowels,</L>
<L>Our Man is hone&s;t, &s;en&s;ible, and plain,</L>
<L>Nor has the Poet made him pert, or vain:</L>
<L>No Beau, no Courtier, nor conceited Youth;</L>
<L>But then &s;o rude, <HI>he always &s;peaks the Truth:</HI></L>
<L>I told him he mu&s;t flatter, learn Addre&s;s,</L>
<L>And gain the Heart of &s;ome rich Patrone&s;s:</L>
<L>'Tis &s;he, &s;aid I, your Labours will reward,</L>
<L>If you but join the Bricklay'r with the Bard;</L>
<L>As thus&mdash;Should &s;he be old and wor&s;e for Wear,</L>
<L>You mu&s;t new-<HI>ca&s;e</HI> her, <HI>front</HI> her and <HI>repair;</HI></L>
<L>If crack'd in Fame, as &s;carce to bear a Touch,</L>
<L>You cannot u&s;e your <HI>Trowel</HI> then too much;</L>
<L><PB REF="70">
In &s;hort, whate'er her Morals, Age or Station,</L>
<L><HI>Plai&s;ter</HI> and <HI>white-wa&s;h</HI> in your Dedication.</L>
<L>Thus I advis'd&mdash;but he dete&s;ts the Plan:</L>
<L>What can be done with &s;uch a &s;imple Man?</L>
<L>A Poet's nothing worth and nought availing,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s he'll furni&s;h, where there is a Failing.</L>
<L>Authors in the&s;e good Times are made and us'd,</L>
<L>To grant tho&s;e Favours Nature has refus'd.</L>
<L>If he won't <HI>fib,</HI> what Bounty can be crave?</L>
<L>We pay for what we want, not what we have.&mdash;</L>
<L>Nay tho' of every <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> we have &s;tore,</L>
<L>Our Sex will always wi&s;h&mdash;a little more.&mdash;</L>
<L>If he'll not bend his Heart to this his Duty,</L>
<L>And &s;ell (to who will buy) Wit, Honour, Beauty;</L>
<L>The Bricklay'r &s;till for him the proper Trade is,</L>
<L>Too rough to deal with Gentlemen and Ladies.&mdash;</L>
<L>In &s;hort&mdash;they'll all avoid him and neglect him,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s that you his <HI>Patrons</HI> will protect him.</L>
