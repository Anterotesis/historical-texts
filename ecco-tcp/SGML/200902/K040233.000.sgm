<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Father of the following little Offspring, being very well convinc'd of the natural Weakne&s;s of this his puny Child, did never intend to tru&s;t it abroad without the <HI>LEADING STRINGS</HI> of <HI>Action;</HI> had not the Fear of tho&s;e, who, like Cowards, are afraid of their own Shadows, a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly oppos'd the Repre&s;entation; being terribly apprehen&s;ive that the Strength of a poor Baby <HI>Mono&s;yllable</HI> might affect the Mag|nanimity of a <HI>Drawcan&s;ir.</HI>&mdash;Such is the Force of Self-Conviction!&mdash;But as this Infant is oblig'd to walk alone, by many who are re&s;olv'd on it's Appearance, it's Father mo&s;t humbly de&s;ires the good-natur'd Town will not tumble the little Creature into the Dirt; but that they will help it forward over the Kennels of Detraction; and, in Com|pa&s;&s;ion to the Tenderne&s;s of it's Age, keep the barking Curs, the Critics, at a Di&s;tance.&mdash; And to excite them to this Benevolence, here
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
follow the Memoirs of the cruel and affecting Period of its Birth, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Piece of <HI>Fun,</HI> Son to the Father, and Grand&s;on to the Grandfather of the &s;ame Name, was conceiv'd, in a Fit of Laughter, about the 8th of <HI>February,</HI> in the Year 1752. &mdash;His Mother advanc'd happily in her Preg|nancy, and there were great Hopes of a fine Offspring; but, unhappily, ju&s;t before the Time of her Delivery, Mea&s;ures were taken, by a certain great Man, to make her mi&s;|carry; excited, as &s;ome &s;ay, to this Piece of Barbarity, by an old Woman's Prophe&s;y which he keeps by him (ca&s;t in <HI>leaden</HI> Characters) in a Che&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;s</HI> &s;ecured, like the <HI>fortunate Tickets</HI> of a Lottery, by <HI>&s;even Locks:</HI> And of which Prophe&s;y the following is a Tran|&s;cript:</P>
<Q><L>When <HI>Fun</HI></L>
<L>Has a Son</L>
<L>Then <HI>Drawcan&s;ir</HI>'s Race is run.</L></Q>
<P>However childi&s;h and ridiculous it may &s;eem for a Man to be affected with &s;uch idle Stuff as this, it is not unprecedented or extravagantly &s;trange; &s;ince Tradition tells us, that <HI>Saturn,</HI> Father of <HI>JUPITER,</HI> the Great Grandfather of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and many other augu&s;t Per&s;onages, were equally mov'd, by &s;uch In&s;tigations, to much the &s;ame Ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5">Notwith&s;tanding, however, all &s;uch malig|nant Mea&s;ures were taken, the full Time of Pregnancy advanc'd, and the Child was hourly expected; when a <HI>po&s;itive Order</HI> came down, that <HI>Mrs. FUN,</HI> who then lay at the <HI>Ca&s;tle-Tavern, Pater-no&s;ter-Row,</HI> mu&s;t not be brought to-bed within the Walls, le&s;t the Child, which was &s;u&s;pected to be a Ba&s;tard, &s;hould bring a Scandal on the <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Cha&s;tity</HI> of the City. Upon this, even while the Lady lay crying out, the Father waited on the chief Per&s;onage of the <HI>Liberties,</HI> with Remon&s;tran|ces, that the Child was very hone&s;tly got, and that none but very creditable People were at the Labour; complaining, at the &s;ame Time, that the &s;ame Privilege had been permitted an <HI>old Woman</HI> of <HI>a very bad Character,</HI> one <HI>Mother Midnight,</HI> who had often practis'd her Profe&s;&s;ion there, tho' it was now denied others. &mdash;'Twas all in vain: The Gentleman, though he behav'd with a great deal of Politene&s;s and Good-manners, was &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd again&s;t the whole Family of <HI>FUN,</HI> which had been fal&s;ely repre&s;ented to him as of no Character or Reputation, that he not only forbid the Men Midwives doing their Duty, but &s;ent others to &s;ee his Orders duly executed.&mdash;What could now be done?&mdash;<HI>Mrs. FUN</HI> was, in the mid&s;t of her Travail, remov'd; and, no|body daring to give her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, her poor Offspring almo&s;t peri&s;hed in the Birth. But
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
Nature had been liberal, the <HI>Stamina</HI> were &s;ound, and branched out for Life. 'Tis true, indeed, its Features were &s;o defac'd, that the &s;trong <HI>Likene&s;s</HI> in them was almo&s;t lo&s;t; and a Weakne&s;s, which will be la&s;ting as it's Life, is the Con&s;equence of the U&s;age it then met with.&mdash;If, after all, then, it &s;hould fail of an&s;wering tho&s;e Expectations the Town had of it, in Embrio; it will undoubtedly be thought, there is Rea&s;on enough to excu&s;e all the Imperfections and Failings it is unhappily afflicted with; &s;ince the&s;e are &s;o far from being its Faults, that they are Misfortunes which mu&s;t infallibly engage the Protection of every candid, tender-hearted, <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> Reader!</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>AS dying Sinners hope to get to Heav'n,</L>
<L>And beg and pray to have their Crimes forgiv'n,</L>
<L>So I come here, with humble Supplication,</L>
<L>In Hopes you'll kindly &s;ave us from <HI>Damnation.</HI></L>
<L>For you mu&s;t know the whole of this <HI>De&s;ign,</HI></L>
<L>The Plot, the Manner, Sentiment is mine.</L>
<L>'Tis true, we mu&s;t confe&s;s, our motley Piece</L>
<L>Is not confin'd by Laws from <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Greece:</HI></L>
<L>For I di&s;dain old <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Rules,</L>
<L>That tie down Scriblers, limit none but <HI>Fools.</HI></L>
<L>I dare beyond the Goal of Critics run,</L>
<L>What Order &s;hould confine the Works of <HI>FUN,</HI></L>
<L>Who&s;e <HI>Self</HI> I am?&mdash;And for your Information,</L>
<L>Hear my Birth, Parentage and Education:</L>
<L>My Sire was, thirty Years ago, in Vogue;</L>
<L>His Name was <HI>WIT,</HI> an arch, diverting Rogue;</L>
<L>My Mother's Name was <HI>HUMOUR,</HI> low and poor,</L>
<L>Reduc'd for Want &s;ometimes to play the Whore.</L>
<L>Who be&s;t repaid what &s;he was pleas'd to grant,</L>
<L>Was <HI>RIBALDRY,</HI> her favourite Gallant.</L>
<L>Now, little Delicacy dwelt in either,</L>
<L>For, as I'm told, they <HI>all Three</HI> lay together.</L>
<L>Soon after I was born, their darling Son,</L>
<L>A Ba&s;tard Compound he!&mdash;was chri&s;ten'd <HI>FUN.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Laughter,</HI> a merry Jade, was cho&s;e my Nur&s;e;</L>
<L>Who&s;e <HI>Birth</HI> was mean, but Education wor&s;e;</L>
<L>Betimes &s;he taught me to di&s;tort the Face,</L>
<L>And &s;neer at ev'ry Thing but want of Grace;</L>
<L>At twelve Years old &s;he &s;ent me fir&s;t to School;</L>
<L>My Tutor, <HI>Ignorance,</HI> a Coxcomb and a Fool.</L>
<L>Little I learn'd 'tis true, but ev'ry Day</L>
<L>The Truant play'd, at length ran quite away.</L>
<L>Proud of my Freedom, rambling up and down,</L>
<L><HI>Folly,</HI> a Jilt that ruins half the Town,</L>
<L>Spreading tho&s;e Arms which ev'ry Fool admires,</L>
<L>Caught me to &s;atisfy her loo&s;e De&s;ires.</L>
<L>The Task, tho' hard, I follow'd with Delight;</L>
<L>Sometimes mo&s;t wi&s;ely wrong, and &s;ometimes blindly right;</L>
<L>Above all Order, or the vain Pretence</L>
<L>Of Learning, Genius, Ta&s;te or Common Sen&s;e.</L>
<L>Who then will cen&s;ure what may here be done?</L>
<L>What <HI>WIT</HI> will critici&s;e a <HI>PIECE OF FUN?</HI></L>
