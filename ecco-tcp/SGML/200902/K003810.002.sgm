<HEAD>LETTER LIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO MRS. ARNOLD.</HEAD>
<P>BY a line ju&s;t received from Loui&s;a I am interdicted at pre&s;ent from writing to her, and the &s;entiments which now oppre&s;s me are, indeed on <HI>all</HI> accounts improper to offer a mind pierced by &s;o &s;imilar a &s;orrow. Yet, to re&s;train the whole dreadful weight in my own bo&s;om would &s;urely kill me. Do <HI>you</HI> then, O my dear cou&s;in, my worthy Caroline, do <HI>you</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;t me.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4">&mdash;Tell me, I conjure you, where the feeling heart &s;hall find a &s;anc|tuary? Tell me, what foliage is thick and impenetrable enough to repel that terror which a&s;&s;ails an unhappy wo|man, when the object of every hope and every fear is determined upon dangers the mo&s;t complicated and de|ci&s;ive? Henry, your <HI>favourite</HI> Henry, is gone, you know, to defend his coun|try, to &s;ignalize his bravery, and to &s;erve his King, I admit the propri|ety of the enterprize, according to the laws of <HI>honour,</HI> but I weep at the ex|tremity of its horror when tried by the laws of <HI>feeling</HI> and <HI>humanity.</HI></P>
<P>The glowing arguments of that dear departed, I did not dare to oppo&s;e.
<PB N="7" REF="5">
I faintly breathed the female re&s;i&s;t|ance. I feared, le&s;t my affection might &s;eem to be &s;elfi&s;h, by conte&s;ting the point of &s;eparation. I violated the &s;oftne&s;s of my &s;ex, and the tender|ne&s;s of my nature, to re&s;train the flowing tide that ro&s;e in billows to my hearr, which laboured with the agony of &s;uppre&s;&s;ion. His being this mo|ment upon the &s;ea, eager to gain the &s;eats of ho&s;tility, is a proof of it! Perhaps, I might have &s;educed him from this adventure, &s;ince humanity and love (oh, how oppo&s;ite from ra|vage and war!) are the principles which figure faire&s;t in the &s;potle&s;s hi&s;tory of Henry's youth. But I dreaded the after operations of inex|orable honour, which might dete&s;t the
<PB N="8" REF="6">
trembling hand that &s;aved it from the &s;word.</P>
<P>Yet <HI>now</HI> my Caroline, <HI>now</HI> that he is far removed from the voice of my complainings, and can no longer be di&s;armed by their &s;weet oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;uffer, oh &s;uffer me to mourn&mdash;&s;uffer me to execrate that in&s;atiate and wan|ton <HI>power,</HI> which &s;catters de&s;olation o'er the land! Ah this dire <HI>daemon</HI> of <HI>battle!</HI>&mdash;this <HI>daemon,</HI> who, with giant foot&s;teps, tramples upon the be&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful affections of the &s;oul&mdash;who delights to hear the wail of the wounded, and the groans of the expi|ring&mdash;who&s;e ve&s;&s;els &s;ail upon a &s;ea of tears, and are wa&s;ted by &s;ighs which are extorted from the tender bo&s;om.
<PB N="9" REF="7">
I &s;ee, I &s;ee the &s;anguinary power. He &s;hoots athwart the realms of affrighted fancy, in a robe of crim&s;on, ten times dyed in the blood of his votaries. The &s;oft verdure of the &s;pring withers into the &s;terility of winter as he advances. The &s;treams of plenty, which fertilized a happy world, &s;tand checked in their progre&s;s, or roll onward a bed of troubled waters. Behold where the ruthle&s;s monarch approaches. The bounties and the beauties of nature fall before him. Territories are torn up by the roots, and empires mingle in the common ravage. Chained to his triumphal car&mdash;behold the lover, the orphan, the friend, the father, and the widow. Oh, Heavens! Fear, de&s;pair, and all the bleeding virtues,
<PB N="10" REF="8">
and all the family of pain, form his retinue. Dreadful, dreadful proce&s;|&s;ion! And all for what?&mdash;for what, my Caroline? Wherefore is the peace of the world thus to be de&s;troyed, where|fore is man to rai&s;e his hand again&s;t the life of man, and deliberate mur|der to be entitled to applau&s;e?</P>
<P>Hear, O humanity, the reply, and be <HI>&s;till,</HI> if thou can&s;t! The rulers of different realms, in the wanton exer|tion of power, infringe upon what is fal&s;ely called the property of each other. Men, who are utter &s;trangers to the very per&s;ons of one another, and are &s;eparated, perhaps, by parti|tions of a thou&s;and leagues, quarrel for a few vile acres of the dirt which
<PB N="11" REF="9">
&s;hall pre&s;ently cover the toiling race; and the lives of a people are devoted to the &s;word. Earth it&s;elf, wide as is extended her beautiful domain, is not <HI>enough</HI> exten&s;ive for the&s;e pigmy mor|tals to divide among&s;t them&s;elves; nor are the natural mi&s;eries of a very &s;horn life, with all its moral, all its civil, all its &s;ocial evils, &s;ufficient, without the aids of untimely and <HI>voluntary</HI> &s;laugh|ter. The hurry of the &s;cene, the din of the battle, and that political mu&s;ic which drowns the cry of di&s;tre&s;s, may <HI>pa&s;s over</HI> the&s;e &s;entiments, and huma|nity will not have time to hear, nor to be heard. But in the quieter moment, when the <HI>gentle</HI> power revi&s;its the bo|&s;om, and re&s;umes the lovely throne from whence &s;he has been driven, oh
<PB N="12" REF="10">
how impious, and how contemptible, will appear tho&s;e bickerings, which terminate in the effu&s;ion of human blood! And could the&s;e heroes enter coolly into the <HI>con&s;equence</HI> of this bar|barous practice: this practice of defa|cing and hacking away the expre&s;s image of their God, to a&s;certain privi|leges, in a world which was made for the reception and accommodation, the peace and the plea&s;ure, of <HI>all</HI> mankind&mdash;could they be &s;pectators of the ca|lamity which equally attends the &s;hout of victory and the &s;hriek of defeat&mdash; could they behold the incon&s;olable wife &s;ink upon her widowed bed, and the child, &s;tretching forth its little hands in vain to greet a returning fa|ther&mdash;a father, left naked, mangled,
<PB N="13" REF="11">
and unburied upon a foreign and an inho&s;pitable &s;hore&mdash;would not the touch of human pity a&s;&s;ert its &s;oft|ening pre&s;&s;ure, and all agree to culti|vate the ble&s;&s;ings of univer&s;al bro|therhood?</P>
<P>How many wretches, forlorn and fallen, are at this in&s;tant pining away on the &s;orrow-&s;teeped couch, while the heedle&s;s multitude echo the prai|&s;es of one who has earned a laurel at the expence of adding acres to his King, and angui&s;h to his country-women? I am no politician, Mrs. Arnold, I am a human being. I am a chri&s;tian. I am one who pro&s;e&s;s to adore a religion of peace&mdash;one too, who can never be per&s;uaded that the
<PB N="14" REF="12">
cherub countenance of man&mdash;the ex|pre&s;s image of the deity, is created thus fair, and thus amiable, to be cruelly &s;ported away in the riots of ambition, pride, and folly.</P>
<P>Ah my dear Henry! alive as thou art to all that is mo&s;t endearing, what will be <HI>thy</HI> &s;en&s;ations <HI>after</HI> the bloody affray! Thou, who&s;e bo&s;om is gent|ler than the milde&s;t and kindlie&s;t bree|zes of the &s;pring!&mdash;what wilt <HI>thou</HI> feel, &s;hould &s;ome haple&s;s woman, at|tended by all her little orphans, de|mand, of thy victorious hand, the &s;laughtered hu&s;band, and the &s;laugh|tered &s;ire? Or &s;hould but thy <HI>fancy</HI> &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch a groupe, ru&s;hing through the ranks, and in piercing tones of

agony exclaiming&mdash; <HI>"re&s;tore, re&s;tore</HI> them to me,"&mdash;how would'&s;t thou &s;upport it? Thou, Hammond, whom the female &s;igh, the female tear, the female &s;hriek, would at any time penetrate to the &s;oul!&mdash;</P>
<P>On the other hand (and the chance alas, is equal) &s;hould it be <HI>thy</HI> fate to fall&mdash;oh thou deare&s;t, be&s;t-beloved, and mo&s;t <HI>worthy</HI> to be &s;o&mdash;&s;hould the malignant &s;tar, that influences, full often, the hero's fortunes&mdash;&s;hould it ordain that&mdash;</P>

<P>MY fair pupil makes a &s;urpri&s;ing progre&s;s in her new &s;tudies; and were not her heart too &s;oft to &s;up|port the pain occa&s;ioned by her hand, &s;he would, in a little time, perform her amputation, and dre&s;s her wound with the be&s;t of us.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR COUSIN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with great willingne&s;s I &s;it down to make a reply to the let|ter you addre&s;&s;ed to me; but it is not without much concern that I find it nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e the pen in an&s;wer to tho&s;e which you addre&s;&s;ed to Loui&s;a, who&s;e pre&s;ent &s;tate of health is &s;uch as to prevent her writing. Anxious, however, even as &s;he pre&s;&s;es the pil|low of &s;ickne&s;s, to alleviate the &s;u&s;|pen&s;e of her beloved Emma (in regard to the promi&s;ed articles of confidence) &s;he in&s;tructs me to acquaint you in the conci&s;e&s;t way that I am able, of the
<PB N="29" REF="27">
means by which &s;he became the wife of your unfortunate brother, as well as with the rea&s;ons which prevailed with her to keep that union a &s;ecret from <HI>his</HI> family, from her <HI>own,</HI> and from the <HI>world.</HI> She conceives too, that the deeper colours of di&s;tre&s;s in <HI>her</HI> fate, may by compari&s;on, alleviate the &s;ofter tints of wretchedne&s;s in <HI>yours;</HI> for at the wor&s;t, my dear cou|&s;in, as matters now &s;tand, you have a lover living who is very properly the, object of many a charming hope; while the poor Loui&s;a is daily tortured with reflecting on the death of one yet dearer than a lover&mdash;even a hu&s;|band and a father, who is the object of many a mi&s;ery too mighty for the &s;olace of &s;ighs and tears.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="28">With re&s;pect to the letter I have had the plea&s;ure to receive from you, it be&s;peaks a heart overflowing with &s;treams of genuine philanthropy, and beautifully becomes the pen of Emma Corbett. But believe me, believe a woman who has been connected from her infancy with men devoted to the trade of arms&mdash;believe the daughter of a veteran chief, and the widow of one who felt the military pa&s;&s;ion in all its force&mdash;believe <HI>her</HI> when &s;he tells you, that &s;uch gentle arguments are never of the lea&s;t con&s;equence in the eyes, or on the minds of a &s;oldier. They &s;erve only to make female weakne&s;s the more pitied by the men, who think the dignity of a more re&s;ol|ved courage <HI>concerned</HI> to &s;hew it&s;elf in
<PB N="31" REF="29">
<HI>contra&s;t.</HI> Sometimes, it is true, the tears of a wife will excite the manly drop in the eye of a hu&s;band; but it tarries not. The voice of public fame is, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, louder than that of private affection. The world fixes an earne&s;t look on the ac|tions of an officer. One hero in|flames another: the &s;parks of glory pa&s;s like an electric power: the nece&s;|&s;ity of a brave <HI>example</HI> becomes appa|rent: the profe&s;&s;ion &s;oon grows into a darling pa&s;&s;ion. The blood warms: the genius of war takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every faculty: home-connexions are forgotten: the &s;cene of action ter|minates the pro&s;pect: the warrior can &s;ee no farther. Valour and victory &s;eem marching before him. There is

not lei&s;ure for a private emotion, and tenderne&s;s would a&s;&s;i&s;t the efforts of his foe. He gives him&s;elf up, there|fore, nobly, and ab&s;olutely, to the battle; wounds can make no impre&s;|&s;ion upon him in the progre&s;s of his ardent career; and death it&s;elf is, in that moment, le&s;s terrible than defeat.</P>
<P>The&s;e, my lovely cou&s;in, are not the &s;entiments of a theori&s;t, but caught immediately from the lips of the very heroes who practi&s;ed every action they relate. In the period of peace, few men of any order have a more elegant humanity than the Engli&s;h officers; and all the endearing qualifications, which make up the great dome&s;tic characters, are to be found among&s;t
<PB N="33" REF="31">
them; but in the day of conte&s;t, my cou&s;in, a different duty calls upon them, and military fame is as ea&s;ily wounded, and its wounds as vital to felicity, as tho&s;e of a woman.</P>
<P>Let not your glowing pencil paint the protectors of our country as beings de&s;titute of every tender feeling, but allow for their &s;ituation, which &s;ome|times renders incompatible the im|mediate union of love and glory: or the duties of peace with the duties of war.</P>
<P>While I clo&s;e this &s;entence, Loui&s;a expre&s;&s;es a wi&s;h to write to you <HI>her|&s;elf.</HI> To-morrow &s;he imagines that &s;he &s;hall be equal to the ta&s;k, and &s;he

To this end I &s;end you the FRAGMENT of a little military hi&s;tory found among&s;t my fa|ther's papers. It will &s;hew you that humanity and bravery are nearly al|lied, and that the tender hu&s;band and good &s;oldier often form the &s;ame
<PB N="35" REF="33">
character, though they cannot always exert them&s;elves in the &s;ame moment; or, perhaps, were we to &s;crutinize nicely, we &s;hould, in reality, find, that when the &s;oldier is hazarding his life and liberty for that of his wife, his children, his countrymen, and his King, he is <HI>then</HI> the tendere&s;t lover, the worthie&s;t hu&s;band, the be&s;t pa|rent, the mo&s;t loyal &s;ubject, and the mo&s;t valuable citizen. I believe it was written by my father in his youth, and I con&s;ider it as a family relique.</P>

<P>OH for the hi&s;tory of that wound! &s;aid I; &s;eeing a &s;car upon the cheek of the per&s;on ap|pointed to &s;hew me the ho&s;pital!&mdash;Oh for the hi&s;tory of that wound!</P>
<P>Not worth the telling, an&s;wered the man, pointing to the &s;tump of his left thigh, as to a more important &s;ubject of curio&s;ity. He took me into a dif|ferent quarter of the building, which pre&s;ented the lodgings of tho&s;e who were pen&s;ioners. In each was a &s;mall-bed,
<PB N="40" REF="38">
bed, a chair, and a table. The atten|dant's name was Julius Carbine. At a door leading into one of the apart|ments he &s;topped; and then looked through an aperture, which com|manded the room.</P>
<P>The luckie&s;t of all moments, &s;aid Julius&mdash;for brother Ne&s;tor will &s;oon be at it, and it is a day of di&s;cipline. We will enter.</P>
<P>Julius, &s;aid the owner of the apart|ment, as we entered, &s;it down with your company. The &s;ide of the bed was covered with a clean white cloth by a little girl who opened the door, and I had al&s;o a little girl with me, and we all &s;at down. It was actually
<PB N="41" REF="39">
the <HI>brother,</HI> and not the brother <HI>&s;oldier</HI> only, to whom Julius introduced us. In their appearance there was a frater|nal &s;imilarity, not &s;o much con&s;i&s;ting in the features and limbs which re|mained, as in the misfortunes which had happened to tho&s;e invi&s;ible parts which lay &s;cattered in different quar|ters of the globe.</P>
<P>Julius was the younger of the Car|bines, and as he placed him&s;elf <HI>&s;ide|ways</HI> upon the bed, and de&s;ired Carbine the elder (who&s;e name was Ne&s;tor) to &s;u&s;pend the attack&mdash;he told his &s;tory.</P>
<P>We &s;lept in the &s;ame cradle, and were nur&s;ed up for the &s;ervice. Our little arms&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="40">He flouri&s;hed a &s;tump which pro|jected about four inches from the right &s;houlder&mdash;Our little arms&mdash;</P>
<P>But I have begun the matter wrong and prematurely, for before I relate the account which Carbine gave of him&s;elf, I &s;hould offer &s;ome de&s;crip|tion, of his per&s;on, as well as that of his brother Ne&s;tor. It is the &s;tump of Julius which reminds me of this.</P>
<P>Carbine the elder was the remnant of a noble figure, who in the upright|ne&s;s of his youth mu&s;t have ri&s;en &s;ix feet from the earth perpendicularly. He had the marks of about &s;eventy years wearing in his face&mdash;allowing for the natural vigour of his form, the
<PB N="43" REF="41">
inva&s;ions of incident, time, and pro|fe&s;&s;ion. The pre&s;ent &s;toop in his &s;houlders was favourable to the height, or rather to the want of height in his apartment. It is not without ju&s;t cau&s;e that I called Ne&s;tor a <HI>rem|nant.</HI> Nature originally mixed up in him her faire&s;t proportions. At the time I &s;aw him he was a capital figure reduced. For in&s;tance, if you looked him in the face, or, more properly to &s;peak, in the re&s;idue of his face, you would perceive, in his left cheek, a deep &s;carification, which boa&s;ted no &s;ort of rival&s;hip with the glorious em|browning of the other that had re|ceived no injury. Though Ne&s;tor him&s;elf &s;aid, "the whole cheek, in compari&s;on with the half cheek,
<PB N="44" REF="42">
looked like an errant poltroon." "It is a cheek," cried he, "which &s;eems to have done no duty; now here," continued he, turning the other &s;ide to view with much triumph, "here are the &s;igns of &s;ervice."</P>
<P>Both the Carbines, indeed, had <HI>&s;erved</HI> to &s;ome purpo&s;e. In point of honorary credentials there was little cau&s;e of jealou&s;y. Nothing could be more equally divided than the mu|tual marks of brotherhood in bravery. Sorely battered were the outworks of both. It is worth while to ob&s;erve how the matter was &s;ettled to their &s;atisfaction and credit. The thigh of Julius became the victim of a para|pet, but then Ne&s;tor was even with
<PB N="45" REF="43">
him when he had the honour to drop his left arm in the counter&s;carp. But as if fortune did not imagine an arm, and that a <HI>left</HI> arm, a &s;ufficient equi|valent to a whole thigh, amputated at one deci&s;ive whizz by a cannon ball, &s;he deprived Ne&s;tor of his right foot, which was left at the bottom of an entrenchment in Flanders. The younger Carbine had the track of a mu&s;quet vi&s;ible at the extremity of his neck, and the bullets with which that mu&s;quet was charged &s;lanted along the left jaw, carrying off &s;ome of the fine&s;t teeth in the world, and which, perhaps, are even yet to be &s;een in one of the fo&s;&s;&eacute;s. To bring the military &s;cale even, on the part of Julius, he has the good fortune to
<PB N="46" REF="44">
conceal under his hat (which upon account of that concealment he &s;eldom wears) a re&s;pectable confu&s;ion, which; beginning at the left ear, &s;wept away not only the greate&s;t part of that, but all that grew in its path, from one end to the other; which di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;troke is in honour of the ba&s;tion. But Julius had his <HI>uno&s;tentatious</HI> wounds too: his &s;hirt covering no le&s;s than &s;ix, in&s;omuch that his bo&s;om was cro&s;&s;ed this way and that, direct and tran&s;ver&s;e, like a draught-board. I detected the flu&s;h of &s;omething like victory in the countenance of Julius, as he threw open his chitterlin, and opened his &s;hirt-collar under pretence of too much heat: but Carbine the elder checked his brother's ambition
<PB N="47" REF="45">
by baring his right arm to his &s;houl|der, (or rather begging <HI>me</HI> to bare it) and there di&s;covering a ma&s;ked battery of blows, which were a fair match for tho&s;e in the brea&s;t of Julius.</P>
<P>Thus were the te&s;timonies of their prowe&s;s participated; and if (&s;aid they) either of us could have boa&s;ted a le&s;s equal divi&s;ion, it would have been a blow too many for our friend|&s;hip, and, perhaps, have bred ill blood betwixt us.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>Here the fragment is torn</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="46">
the veteran Carbines, after having platooned and pioneered it for a number of years, in the cau&s;e of their country, found at length, they could keep the field no longer.</P>
<P>They entered the Temple of Peace: but not quite on the footing of ordi|nary members. The &s;enior Carbine privately enjoyed &s;ome &s;mall privi|leges, and the junior was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;ualties, derivable from &s;hew|ing the ho&s;pital to &s;uch as had the curio&s;ity to &s;urvey it: and he hopped about with his <HI>ruins</HI> in a manner that engaged one's pity and admiration.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>A &s;econd rent in the fragment.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="47">Now Ne&s;tor was a man of inali|enable affections. They were not to be &s;ubdued. The military pa&s;&s;ion was by no means dead in his bo&s;om. The heart of the &s;oldier was &s;till vi&s;i|ble in his little bed-chamber. There were to be &s;een, &s;u&s;pended from the walls, the battered cor&s;let that had co|vered his brea&s;t, and the firelock, who&s;e iron mouth was almo&s;t worn out by the loadings. They were brightly burni&s;hed, and the nice&s;t care taken to clean them weekly.</P>
<P>But this was nothing. The practi|cal part of a &s;oldier's di&s;cipline did
<PB N="50" REF="48">
Ne&s;tor carry on in a room of forty inches diameter.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner were we all &s;eated by the &s;ide of the bed, than a &s;ingular cere|mony began. He had &s;ix &s;ons, all little, all living for their country, and in &s;ecret training for the battle under their father. It was his cu&s;tom, thrice in the week, to turn the key upon all the pen&s;ioners but his brother, and in&s;truct his family in the art of war. Poor as he was, he had actually been at the co&s;t of equipping them; had fitted up for them &s;omething that re|&s;embled a uniform, and, in miniature accoutrements, pre&s;ented them with the &s;word, the mu&s;quet, and the bayonet.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="49">The &s;oldier's &s;cience was taught them by the veteran. One branch or another of the art military was the &s;ubject of every day. The &s;ons of Ne&s;tor Carbine knew not the enerva|ting luxuries of artificial heat: they thawed the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;ons with nobler fires. Their education was wholly martial. At night they li&s;tened to the lecture, and their &s;words were drawn forth to practice what they had heard in the morn. They engaged their &s;trengthening arms in the <HI>mock</HI> fight, that they might be prepared for the <HI>real</HI> one. It was now the evening of the ravelin, then of the flanking; now of the fortification, then of the fo&s;&s;&eacute; now of the half-moon, then of the epaulement; now of the &s;aps, and
<PB N="52" REF="50">
then of the ambu&s;cade; now of the horn-works, and then of the ba&s;tion; now of the gabion, and then again of the mines, the parapet, the battery, or the tenaille.</P>
<P>They had ju&s;t began an engage ment as we entered the room.</P>
<P>It will be be&s;t related before the younger Carbine tells his &s;tory. Let him therefore repo&s;e a little longer upon the bed.</P>
<P>The &s;tripling troops were drawn up three deep in the center of the room, and the object of attack was a large deal trunk &s;et upright betwixt the contending parties. One &s;ide were to
<PB N="53" REF="51">
oppo&s;e and one to defend. The fa|ther was commander, and in good time came the brother, who in&s;tead of repo&s;ing on the bed as above-menti|oned, &s;prung up with &s;urprizing agi|lity, and hopped away to head the adver&s;e party, making a kind of war|like mu&s;ic with a little drum tattoo'd by the timber in&s;trument that &s;erved him for an arm. Ne&s;tor, meantime, a&s;&s;umed a whi&s;tle which &s;erved for a clarionet.</P>
<P>The engagement was carried on in the exacte&s;t military order; they ad|vanced, they retreated, they rallied, and they came on again. Every little heart panted with ambition, every eye &s;parkled with expectation of victory.
<PB N="54" REF="52">
The mimic ardour &s;oon became real, and the two generals were them&s;elves wrought up into a &s;erious &s;en&s;ation. Julius &s;houted, and Ne&s;tor encou|raged. But, pre&s;ently, the a&s;pect of the battle altered, for one of the <HI>be&s;ie|gers,</HI> (a boy of uncommon bravery) took one of the <HI>be&s;ieged</HI> pri&s;oner. The conqueror flouri&s;hed his little foil, but the captive &s;hed tears of &s;lavery and &s;orrow. The general on the wor&s;ted &s;ide affected to be di&s;mayed. His opponent, &s;pirited up his army, pur&s;ued his victory, took a <HI>&s;econd</HI> of the enemy pri&s;oner, and the town (that is, the <HI>box</HI>) was taken.</P>
<P>A &s;hout of joy was heard on one &s;ide, while the poor remains of the
<PB N="55" REF="53">
conquered troops fled to a corner that was the interior encampment behind the bed. Julius beat the dead march with his wooden drum&s;tick: but Ne&s;tor and his troops, having bur&s;t the city gates, (that is, the box <HI>lid</HI>) proceeded to plunder. It contained all the magazines of the enemy, con|&s;i&s;ting of new foils, martial caps, belts, wooden bayonets, confections and fruits. The&s;e were the prizes of conque&s;t. They were all fairly won, and divided among&s;t the victors ac|cording to &s;eniority. The little girl, who had &s;at on the bed, now &s;prung up, took a &s;mall ozier ba&s;ket from a hook, and &s;trewed flowers in the path of the victorious, &s;inging a &s;ong of triumph as they marched round the
<PB N="56" REF="54">
room. The ceremonies, however, being over, both parties came for|ward, and &s;hook hands very heartily in token of good will, and then the affair ended with <Q>God &s;ave great George our King</Q> and a general huzza.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>&mdash;Our little arms, continued Julius, (whom I will interrupt no more) were nur&s;ed into early vigour for the field: for our father, who&s;e bones&mdash;</P>
<P>May every Saint ble&s;s them, &s;aid Ne&s;tor!</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="55">&mdash;have been repo&s;ing more than half a century, in different parts of Flanders and Germany, &s;truck fir&s;t into that mode of training which my brother has adopted. Other people's children have playthings given them, becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, they whimper for them; but we were never allowed &s;o much as a hoop or a top till we gained it by a victory. We knew the diffi|culty of obtaining the prize, and va|lued it the more; and thus were fitted for deeds of hardihood, ere other in|fants had an idea of glory.</P>
<P>Poor creatures! &s;aid Ne&s;tor's &s;e|cond &s;on &s;cornfully.</P>
<P><HI>We</HI> could vault upon the &s;teeds of the menage before <HI>they</HI> could keep
<PB N="58" REF="56">
the &s;addle of their wooden ponies. Ripe for practice, we were &s;ent forth, at an early age, to the field, and both of us entered as volunteers in the &s;er|vice of our country.</P>
<P>We did &s;o, &s;aid Ne&s;tor.</P>
<P>Nature&mdash;for which &s;tump as I am, I &s;till thank her&mdash;gave us no bad forms; and though we took the field with faces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s effeminate as that of our mo|ther,&mdash;[You was reckoned the very model of her, you know, Ne&s;tor]&mdash;yet the fir&s;t campaign left us no room to blu&s;h upon that &s;core. Our virgin engagement happened in the hotte&s;t glow of the &s;ummer, and we were &s;oon rid of a delicacy which is inglo|rious
<PB N="59" REF="57">
on the front of a &s;oldier. Oh with what plea&s;ure did we contemplate the alterations at our return!</P>
<P>I remember it, &s;aid Ne&s;tor, &s;miling.</P>
<P>The traits of the mother were quite worn out by the weather. In every lineament there was &s;ea&s;oning. The &s;un had written hero in our counte|nances, and we rejoiced in the dignity of the tan.</P>
<P>But mark the joke, &s;ir; a fanta&s;tical pair of wenches pretended to love us, in our fair-weather &s;uit of features, before we made the fir&s;t &s;ally, that is, before we were <HI>worth</HI> loving; but took it into their heads to quarrel with our
<PB N="60" REF="58">
appearance the very moment we re|turned. They wanted &s;till to &s;ee the red and white of the <HI>woman,</HI> and &s;o took to them&s;elves new paramours.&mdash;The jades gave us up, &s;ir, for a couple of fellows who would &s;hudder at the patter of a hail-&s;torm.</P>
<P>So much the better, &s;aid Ne&s;tor. We have had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee one of the ra&s;cals hanged for &s;heep-&s;tealing, and the other you know is to be put into the pill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ory this day &s;e'en-night.</P>
<P>And I'll be prepared for him, I warrant ye, exclaimed one of the boys.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="59">No, child, &s;aid Ne&s;tor: he is no mark for the &s;on of a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>After this, &s;ir, we had no lazy pe|riods of peace. Some part or another of Europe was continually beating the drum or &s;ounding the trumpet in the ear of England. It was our duty to go forth in her defence.</P>
<P>Father, &s;aid the elde&s;t of the boys, when is it likely we &s;hall have a <HI>war?</HI></P>
<P>My brother, &s;ir,&mdash;(continued Car|bine, who was not put out by any, fa|mily remarks)&mdash;my brother, &s;ir, had, the honour of the fir&s;t misfortune.</P>
<P>You do not call it by a right name, &s;aid Ne&s;tor.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="60"><HI>He</HI> triumphed in the fir&s;t te&s;timony of the warrior.</P>
<P>I am an elder brother, &s;aid Ne&s;tor, and the fir&s;t blow was my birth-right.</P>
<P>But I was &s;oon even with him: for, towards the clo&s;e of the campaign, a random &s;hot&mdash;when I was thinking of nothing le&s;s, gave the four fingers of my left hand to the enemy. In that condition we entered into winter quarters.</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner was my brother cured of the wound in his face&mdash;</P>
<P>You may &s;ee the mark of it here, &s;ir, &s;aid Ne&s;tor.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="61">&mdash;in his face, than he received one much deeper in his heart!</P>
<P>In his <HI>heart,</HI> cried the younge&s;t of the &s;ix &s;ons, clapping his hand on his father's &s;ide?&mdash;why, you joke: here it is alive and merry now. I can feel it beat.</P>
<P>God keep it &s;o, an&s;wered the elde&s;t. It will be a &s;ore day for us when that &s;tops, I promi&s;e thee.</P>
<P>Give me thy hand, Ferdinand, &s;aid Ne&s;tor; and, brother, do you go on with your &s;tory, for it entertains the gentleman and his little daughter, and I like to hear it. You were always good at a &s;tory from a child. Go on.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="62">&mdash;would you believe it &s;ir, that a fellow &s;o &s;liced &s;hould have the im|pudence to attack one of the prettie&s;t girls in England?</P>
<P>In the <HI>world,</HI> you might have &s;aid, cried Ne&s;tor, &s;haking his knee.</P>
<P>&mdash;like a brave boy of the blade, he pu&s;hed his point right on, turned his <HI>wor&s;t</HI> &s;ide to the wench, and in|&s;i&s;ted upon her taking the &s;cars as a recommendation.</P>
<P>Why they <HI>were</HI> &s;o, &s;aid Ne&s;tor, holding his knee &s;till while he &s;poke.</P>
<P>&mdash;in this manner he continued to batter the citadel which trembled
<PB N="65" REF="63">
in the bo&s;om of the poor girl, and in le&s;s than a month (no time at all for &s;uch a &s;iege) he entered the fair ca&s;tle of her affections in triumph.</P>
<P>By the blood that I have &s;hed, &s;ir, &s;aid Ne&s;tor, and by the drops which <HI>yet</HI> flow in my body, Frances was the be&s;t and brave&s;t wench that ever lay by the &s;ide of a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>Ne&s;tor, &s;aid Julius, hold your tongue.&mdash;His limbs, &s;ir, were almo&s;t con&s;tantly on the move. War carried them away. What of that? His joke was ready. Never mind, Frances, (would he &s;ay to his wife) I am the winner yet. Fear nothing. Were I reduced to my trunk, I &s;hould flouri&s;h
<PB N="66" REF="64">
&s;till, my girl. A &s;oldier, who&s;e chil|dren have blood in their veins, is invul|nerable. He is immortal in his &s;ons.</P>
<P>Let us <HI>engage,</HI> father! &s;aid one of the boys eagerly, as he brandi&s;hed his &s;oil.</P>
<P>Thus would my brother heal up the wounds of the war: but be that as it may, wounds are but &s;orry things in a family. Often has my brother di&s;puted with me on this &s;ub|ject. "Julius, (would he &s;ay) thou art but half a loyal &s;ubject &s;till&mdash;<HI>thou</HI> give&s;t to thy country the &s;ervices only of an individual, while <HI>I</HI> furni&s;h it with the force of a whole family. As an <HI>individual,</HI> thou mu&s;t &s;oon die; but
<PB N="67" REF="65">
had&s;t thou taken care to <HI>multiply</HI> thy|&s;elf as I have done, thou mighte&s;t well expect to live and conquer the&s;e thou|&s;and years. Brother, brother, it is a fal&s;e notion; a &s;oldier ought of all men in his Maje&s;ty's dominions the &s;oone&s;t to marry: he ought indeed." Notwithstanding this, &s;ir, I could ne|ver be prevailed upon. No, though an hone&s;t girl offered to &s;ling my knap&s;ack acro&s;s her &s;houlder after the lo&s;s of my thigh. To confe&s;s the plain truth to you, I did not like cer|ta
in ceremonies betwixt my brother and &s;i&s;ter, at their partings. Frances indeed wept but little, but in my opi|nion, &s;he <HI>looked</HI> a much deeper &s;orrow than is to be expre&s;&s;ed by a pair of wet eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="66">Ne&s;tor hemm'd violently.</P>
<P>And as to my brother, though he cocked his hat fiercely&mdash;pretended to have caught cold&mdash;rubbed up his ac|coutrements, and blu&s;tered mightily, he never was &s;teadily him&s;elf&mdash;and how the devil <HI>&s;hould</HI> he be&mdash; for a week after. The&s;e things, &s;ir, are again&s;t the grain. The bru&s;h of a bullet is nothing at all: it may take off your head, or it may only take off your hat: either way, no great matter&mdash;but the cries of a woman&mdash;the piercing ago|nies of a wife to come acro&s;s one's thoughts in the la&s;t moments&mdash;no, &s;ir,&mdash; no, damn it&mdash;there is no bearing that&mdash; I will live and die a batchelor!</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="67">But this is not the wor&s;t, &s;ir. <HI>Death</HI> &s;ometimes comes at the bottom of the account to <HI>un&s;oldier</HI> a man. He knocked at brother Ne&s;tor's door, and carried Frances away while &s;he was nur&s;ing him of a fever into which he was thrown by the pain of a wound. Zounds! that was a terrible day, Ne&s;tor, was it not?</P>
<P>Terrible! &s;aid Ne&s;tor, turning his head from the company.</P>
<P>She died &s;uddenly. Courage, &s;aid I, brother. He waved his hand and &s;poke not. Brother, &s;aid I, have cou|rage. "Fool, replied he, in a pa&s;|&s;ion&mdash;(if he had called me &s;o in cold blood, I would have had him out)&mdash;
<PB N="70" REF="68">
Fool, &s;aid he, (in a way that one could not but forgive him, &s;tamping his foot on the ground at the &s;ame time) am I, thinke&s;t thou, before GOD ALMIGHTY or the enemy? What has courage to do before HIM? thou &s;hould'&s;t tell me to be <HI>patient.</HI> I &s;aid no more: for the poor Frances lay dead before his eyes; and there being but one bed of any &s;ize, the living and the dead lay together.</P>
<P>Child, (&s;aid Ne&s;tor to the little girl, his daughter, who was &s;obbing at the &s;ide of the bed, with her apron thrown over her eyes)&mdash;come hither. Thou art <HI>like</HI> thy mother&mdash;ki&s;s me.</P>
<P>Ne&s;tor (continued Julius) tied the crape round his arm, and his &s;oul was
<PB N="71" REF="69">
in mourning. He gave Frances to the earth. Decency&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Go no farther,</HI> &s;aid Ne&s;tor.</P>

<P>Julius, GO NO FARTHER, I &s;ay, (cried Ne&s;tor) pre&s;&s;ing his daughter clo&s;e to his brea&s;t.</P>

<P>after the engagement, the &s;olemn thoughts again came on. Julius rubbed his face twice or thrice along the pillow, and declared that while the wind continued in that quarter, his old achs would twinge him a little.</P>

<P>I KNOW not whether I &s;hall live long enough to relate the horrors of my &s;ituation!</P>
<P>On the evening of the day that I de&s;ired the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, I felt an im|pul&s;e, more &s;trong and more &s;acred than that of common curio&s;ity, to know the full &s;cope of my &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P><HI>Before</HI> this interview, my di&s;tre&s;s ap|peared &s;ufficiently great. Alas! we are continually exclaiming that the heart will break, without knowing what ad|ditional burthens it will bear, even when we think it is <HI>mo&s;t</HI> &s;urcharged.</P>

<P><HI>Unfortunate,</HI> &s;ir, did you &s;ay?</P>
<P>O <HI>mo&s;t</HI> unfortunate, my Emma! I am in di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;<HI>worldly</HI> di&s;tre&s;s. And it is &s;o extreme, that I have been compelled (ah, hard nece&s;&s;ity!) to di&s;|po&s;e

<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to detail the cala|mity. It is cru&s;hing: it is irremedi|able: it is ruinous. I am in beggary.</P>
<P>Oh, Emma! bred up to elevated expectations, what is to become of thee? Your brother is &s;lain. Your father old and enervated, a prey to pain of body from the mo&s;t piercing of human di&s;orders, and to angui&s;h of mind, from reflections the mo&s;t cut|ting.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO EMMA CORBETT.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prior to the receipt of the above,</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>NO, my loved &s;i&s;ter, I will not, cannot, &s;end a long &s;tory. A few pages will compri&s;e the main circum&s;tances; and let tho&s;e &s;uffice till days of future conver&s;ation. Your father had ever an ambition to enlarge the fortune of his Edward by marriage: and Edward had already &s;ufficient to his wi&s;hes. He ac|quainted his father of the love which he bore to Loui&s;a. It produced a di&s;pute. My brother happened to be pre&s;ent. He entered, as your father exclaimed, "What but beggary can be expected with a girl like Loui&s;a
<PB N="90" REF="87">
Hammond, of &s;carce an hundred pounds a year!"&mdash;The conver&s;a|tion &s;topped.</P>
<P>Sir, (&s;aid Henry to Edward, when they were alone) had any man living but Emma's father &s;poke in tho&s;e terms of my &s;i&s;ter, he &s;hould have been puni&s;hed for it &s;everely.&mdash;I love <HI>Emma Corbett,</HI> and to her he is in|debted for&mdash;</P>
<P>And I love <HI>Loui&s;a Hammond,</HI> &s;ir, (replied your brother) but my father has an arm of his own, and that fail|ing, he has that of a <HI>&s;on,</HI> to defend him from the in&s;ults of a boy, &s;hould he <HI>dare</HI> to&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="88">It is an improper place to di&s;cu&s;s the que&s;tion, &s;aid Henry. They went out. Henry commanded Ed|ward, in terms of intolerable &s;eve|rity, never to offer his hand to Loui&s;a, while Edward in&s;i&s;ted, that Henry &s;hould de&s;i&s;t from farther engaging the affections of Emma. The inhi|bition was promi&s;ed to be ob&s;erved, and a breach of it was to terminate in the la&s;t frightful deci&s;ion among&s;t men. Edward cea&s;ed his vi&s;its, and I knew not the cau&s;e. Henry did the &s;ame, and you was equally ignorant of the motive. I fell &s;ick; a fever &s;eized my &s;pirits, and my life was de|&s;paired of. Edward heard of my ill|ne&s;s, and came to vi&s;it me at a time that he knew Henry was from home.
<PB N="92" REF="89">
He found me in the extremity&mdash;the fever was become putrid, and the phy|&s;ician ordered no one to approach my breath any nearer than could be avoided; the bed was &s;trewed with the herbs which are &s;uppo&s;ed to pre|vent infection. Regardle&s;s of this, and every other image of &s;elf-pre&s;er|vation, Edward ru&s;hed into my cham|ber, threw him&s;elf upon his knees by the &s;ide of the bed, and hung his head over my face, which received and welcomed the tender tears that were &s;treaming from his eyes. O! Loui&s;a, Loui&s;a, (&s;aid he) I can bear it no longer! At the&s;e words Henry was heard upon the &s;tairs, Edward leaped up&mdash;Heavens! &s;aid he, can it be po&s;|&s;ible, is Henry returned! Well, it is
<PB N="93" REF="90">
no matter. My brother entered the room, and at the &s;ight of Edward &s;tept back, like a man a&s;toni&s;hed. Edward ran up to him, threw his arms about his neck, and in&s;i&s;ted that the em|brace &s;hould be returned. Oh Henry, he exclaimed, too long have we mu|tually &s;uffered a fal&s;e delicacy to pre|vail. Enough have we &s;acrificed to pique, for Emma and Loui&s;a have been the victims. I heard that your &s;i&s;ter was dying, and I could not deny my&s;elf the mournful privilege of a friend&mdash;will you chide me for it Henry?&mdash;will you &s;till withhold your hand and your heart from the brother of Emma Corbett? <HI>Will you?</HI> This was the fir&s;t moment I had been in|formed of the di&s;pute. The &s;urpri&s;e
<PB N="94" REF="91">
was too much for me in the <HI>firme&s;t</HI> &s;tate of my con&s;titution. In the con|dition I <HI>then</HI> was, it had well-nigh proved fatal. All which my &s;trength &s;uffered me to do was to rai&s;e my&s;elf on my pillow, fold my hands in the attitude of intreaty, and with feeble accents to implore, they would &s;pare my la&s;t moments, and not embitter them by <HI>their</HI> enmity.</P>
<P>Ere I had uttered this, Henry and Edward were weeping on the necks of each other, and Henry &s;aid, alas! Ed|ward, I <HI>owe</HI> you more than this, for on my part was the promi&s;e fir&s;t bro|ken. I have &s;ecretly maintained the u&s;ual corre&s;pondence with Emma, &s;ince &s;he has been away: and found
<PB N="95" REF="92">
the <HI>tenderne&s;s</HI> &s;uperior to the <HI>anger</HI> of my temper. Indeed we have <HI>both</HI> been wrong. Henceforward, let us be <HI>more</HI> than friends&mdash;if po&s;&s;ible, let us be brothers. Shall we not my Edward?</P>
<P>Again Emma I cla&s;ped my hands, and a &s;udden &s;en&s;e of joy came over me that gave a turn&mdash;a <HI>happy</HI> turn to my di&s;order. I recovered. It was agreed between us that the <HI>cau&s;e of the quar|rel,</HI> and the means of t
he reconcilia|tion, &s;hould be equally a &s;ecret. The families were re-united, and none but Edward, Henry, and Loui&s;a, could account for the late coolne&s;s on the part of the two former. But the har|mony was not of long duration;&mdash;
<PB N="96" REF="93">
it was again interrupted by your fa|ther's violence in the cau&s;e of <HI>America,</HI> oppo&s;ed to that of my brother in the cau&s;e of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> Edward &s;ided with the former, and, though it no longer prevented an intercour&s;e be|tween us, it threatened an eternal &s;e|paration of political intere&s;ts. At the &s;ame time Henry was permitted to addre&s;s you, and Edward conti|nued openly his partiality for me. Nay, your father at la&s;t declared, he hoped &s;till to &s;ee two countries re&s;to|red to the embraces of each other, and two happy matches to felicitate their union. You were, my dear Emma, fortunately from home on a vi&s;it during mo&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions, and your Henry did not think it pru|dent
<PB N="97" REF="94">
to break the thread of an elegant affection by the little jarrings that were happening to cro&s;s it at home. The conte&s;t now became fierce on the other &s;ide the Atlantic, and threatened to carry bload&s;hed and rapine to that part of the continent where Edward had property. Loui&s;a, (&s;aid he to me, one evening) I mu&s;t cro&s;s the &s;eas: my fortune is in danger: it con|cerns equally you and me, that I &s;hould endeavour to de&s;end it, yet I will wait another month to hear the event of terms that are propo&s;ing be|tween the countries&mdash;if they produce <HI>peace,</HI> you know how ready I &s;hall be to continue in England; if they <HI>fail</HI> of that end, you mu&s;t have re&s;olution enough to part from me for a &s;hort
<PB N="98" REF="95">
&s;ea&s;on. But, continued he, as no man can tell the chances of the &s;lighte&s;t &s;eparation, I ardently wi&s;h to call you by the tendere&s;t of all human titles, <HI>mine,</HI> before I go. <HI>Publickly</HI> this can|not be done, for though my father affects to con&s;ent, our union would make himun happy. No, Loui&s;a: let our happine&s;s be known only to our|&s;elves till it is proper to communicate ir. Impart it nor, till my return at lea&s;t, to Emma, to Henry, or to any part of the family. I have my rea|&s;ons for it, even more &s;trong than tho&s;e that have been already related.</P>
<P>Soon after this conver&s;ation, Emma, we were privately married, and none of the appointments that led to the
<PB N="99" REF="96">
ceremony, or which &s;ucceeded it, were di&s;covered or &s;u&s;pected. Pre|vious to the voyage of my haple&s;s hu&s;band, he put into my hand a &s;ealed paper, containing his will, and he de|&s;ired I would not open it till his re|turn. In the fond hope of that return being po&s;&s;ible, I have, till within the&s;e few days, kept the &s;eal unbroken, and now, alas! I find it is a te&s;tamentary di&s;po&s;al of his property abroad, be|queathed entirely to me as &s;ole exe|cutrix.&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, my dear Emma, there <HI>is</HI> a fa|therle&s;s Edward, and Heaven only knows whether the father had any knowledge of its birth before he died. I repeatedly &s;ent letters, full of all a
<PB N="100" REF="97">
mother's minute and affecting &s;olici|tude, but I received no replies. To Mrs. Arnold, dear and generous friend as &s;he is, I owe the power of keeping my hu&s;band's &s;ecret, not|with&s;tanding an event that promi&s;ed to betray it. The poor little one was lately taken ill, and his death every moment expected. It was that (oh Nature!) made me write the di&s;ordered &s;crawl, which intrea|ted Emma to forbear her vi&s;it. On my reaching the hou&s;e of our wor|thy Caroline, I found the cold hand of death lay heavy on my child. I wept &s;ore. I offered up the prayer of the de&s;olate widow, not <HI>wholly</HI> to be|reave me; and begged (ah how ear|ne&s;tly)
<PB N="101" REF="98">
the Ble&s;&s;ed God to re&s;tore <HI>one</HI> or receive <HI>both!</HI></P>
<P>My prayer was heard. My child grew well. Your letter came in the warme&s;t, newe&s;t, and mo&s;t melting moment of matron extacy. The &s;mile of the babe was in my eye, and in my heart. I &s;aw miniatur'd forth, the features of the murdered Edward. Oh the beautiful extreme of rapture! It grew too big for bearing. I de|voured my child with ki&s;&s;es. I ran with weeping joy to Mrs. Arnold. I thought of thee, oh lovely Emma, as of Edward's &s;i&s;ter, and I gave thee, in that charmingly unguarded period, the dear depo&s;it of my bo&s;om, which none but Caroline &s;hares with thee.</P>

<P>THE irre&s;olute note which I &s;ent this morning to your chamber, is not worth your attempting to decy|pher. I wanted to expre&s;s my &s;ym|pathy of your pre&s;ent misfortune in a way more an&s;werable to the emotions of my friend&s;hip. I wi&s;hed to gather &s;uch knowledge of &s;ome per&s;ons <HI>con|nected with your lo&s;s,</HI> as might enable me to plan &s;ome pious fraud to relieve your &s;tuation without wounding your delicacy. But I &s;hould make bung|ling work of it, and de&s;troy the feli|city I intended to promote. I am a man of plain feelings, and have no dexterity of addre&s;s when it is nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="110" REF="107">
to adorn them. Accept then, dear Corbett, of an hone&s;t mind, in lieu of elegant manners. Is any decoration nece&s;&s;ary to introduce a friendly circum&s;tance?&mdash;and if there is not, wherefore do I thus lengthen the preface?</P>
<P>Corbett, I am one of tho&s;e whom the world calls an unthrifty fellow: for I value money merely as it con|duces to my happine&s;s. My happi|ne&s;s depends on &s;ociety, and not on my&s;elf alone. I have fixed it in the dear dome&s;tic circle that enclo&s;es Emma and her father. Beyond that barrier I do nor de&s;ire to wander; and if I can promote their felicity, my own will, of nece&s;&s;ity, be compleat.
<PB N="111" REF="108">
You &s;ee my &s;y&s;tem. It is &s;imple and conci&s;e. By uncommon chance I am become rich, you know. The &s;um I po&s;&s;e&s;s is too much to be di&s;&s;ipated, and not enough if I had a pa&s;&s;ion to accumulate. It is quite &s;ufficient to render three per&s;ons happy, &s;o far as happine&s;s takes its colour from mo|ney. Among&s;t three per&s;ons then let it be divided; but let only two of tho&s;e know the &s;ource by which the third is &s;upplied. You may ea&s;ily per&s;uade Emma to believe (what in|deed will be true) that by an unex|pected turn, your lo&s;&s;es are repaired. She will be too much rejoiced at the event to teaze her&s;elf about the means. Or, if &s;he <HI>&s;hould</HI> enquire, her curio&s;ity is of a tender kind, and will readily
<PB N="112" REF="109">
be pacified. I hope you love me too well to make &s;cruples; and yet I &s;hall prepare my&s;elf to combat them. It is really a very hard and mortifying thing, that the&s;e <HI>bare-weight</HI> duties betwixt friend and friend, &s;hould be &s;o rare as to make the offer of them a matter of embarra&s;sment; as if there was nothing expected in &s;ociety but its etiquette and profe&s;&s;ions. All I de&s;ire is, that you will lo&s;e no time in &s;ettling your affairs, and no otherwi&s;e remember the <HI>mode</HI> by which they are accommodated, than as it may im|pre&s;s your bo&s;om with tender &s;en&s;a|tions, and &s;trengthen the cement of that alliance which is formed between us.

<P>I FANCY there was &s;ome <HI>mi&s;take</HI> in the letter that I enclo&s;ed from Corbett: for I find his affairs are all re-adju&s;ted, and the generous refu&s;al of my overtures to Emma (at a time when mo&s;t parents would think them mo&s;t acceptable) has no longer force. The prohibition is taken off, and I am again at liberty to make my&s;elf tenderly unhappy.</P>
<P>Corbett is now as much recovered in health, as in his circum&s;tances, and word is ju&s;t brought that Emma is better. O my heart! how &s;hall I &s;upport the &s;ight of her!&mdash;If her &s;ick|ne&s;s

Methinks I have more fondly wi&s;h'd my&s;elf her hu&s;band &s;ince her con|finement and indi&s;po&s;ition, than while &s;he was rejoicing in health and plea|&s;ure. I do not de&s;ire to unite my&s;elf to her beauty, more than to her weak|ne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s. Surely, Frederick, the tender offices of a friend are <HI>mo&s;t</HI> amiable, where they are <HI>lea&s;t</HI> ob&s;erved by the world. The feeblene&s;&s;es to which the tender frame of woman is &s;ubject, are, perhaps, more &s;educing than her bloom.

<P>I am now in London, attending the &s;ick chamber of Emma, into which I gain acce&s;s only by virtue of my pro|fe&s;&s;ion. Her affection preys fa&s;t upon her health.

<P>I WILL not affect to mi&s;conceive you, my only parent.

An un&s;ubdued veneration for truth attends me. I caught the in&s;piring affection I bear her, from the re&s;pect|able authors of my being. It is a pre|judice as early as it is amiable, and you &s;hould not wonder if I walk &s;tea|dily in the way of my directors. This, &s;ir, I have often told you. I have been brought up to con&s;ider the happine&s;s
<PB N="155" REF="152">
of life, not as deducible from the maxims of the world, but from impli|cit reliance upon that power whom Heaven has &s;eated upon the throne of the &s;oul, as an unerring judge in all ca&s;es of moral arbitration. It has been a hard ta&s;k for me to &s;truggle with the various inflictions which have long hung over our hou&s;e, and though the bur&s;t of nature has &s;ometimes bro|ken unawares, it was not in <HI>tho&s;e</HI> &s;ea|&s;ons that I was the mo&s;t unhappy. When only the pitying eye of GOD was upon me, when I &s;ought the &s;ilent corner, and could &s;ecretly commune with my own heart, and enter into all its inclinings: then&mdash;<HI>then,</HI> my father, it was that the extreme of your Emma's wretchedne&s;s came over her;
<PB N="156" REF="153">
for &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to wean her affections from an object, one &s;o en|tirely and with &s;o good rea&s;on appro|ved, and now &s;o entirely, and (you will pardon me) without any &s;olid rea|&s;ons, rejected. I have not, at this period, my deare&s;t father, collection of mind enough for much argument; but you will plea&s;e to recollect that it was you who fir&s;t kindled the &s;parks of tenderne&s;s for Henry. Be&s;ides that we were brought up together, when gentle impre&s;&s;ions are ea&s;ily admitted and unre&s;ervedly avowed, you re|pre&s;ented him as an orphan of honour, talents, and good-&s;en&s;e. I depend on every thing you &s;ay, and was charmed with a &s;entiment corre&s;pondent to my own. The affection was full grown,
<PB N="157" REF="154">
and had expanded into blo&s;&s;om, ere you attempted to de&s;troy, or even to check it. Then, <HI>all at once,</HI> you &s;aid you had your rea&s;ons, (which to this hour remain partly unexplained) to de&s;ire I would think no more of Henry Hammond: yet, you averred, it was not fortune nor any other cir|cum&s;tance relating to what the world calls <HI>a good match,</HI> that created a change in your e&s;teem. Want of <HI>worth</HI> I am &s;ure it <HI>could</HI> not be; and yet you &s;till per&s;i&s;t to di&s;&s;uade me from attaching my&s;elf to merit, elegance, and virtue.</P>
<P>I am glad this method of addre&s;&s;ing each other by letter, though in the &s;ame hou&s;e, has, by accident, been adopted. It appeared awkward at
<PB N="158" REF="155">
fir&s;t, but hath now the familiarity of a habit. It may well be &s;aid, in <HI>my</HI> ca&s;e, "to excu&s;e the blu&s;h and pour out all the heart." Yet wherefore do I talk of blu&s;hing! Surely, it is not nece&s;&s;ary. I yield not to any roman|tic pomps of pa&s;&s;ion. I make it not a &s;ubject, where it can be likely to create one di&s;cordant feeling. I love with &s;implicity and truth: and it is far be|yond my power&mdash;far, even as the pre|&s;ervation of a &s;olemn vow is from the breach of it, to change my object but with a change of its purity. The oaths that are taken at the altar, &s;ir, may <HI>ratify</HI> tenderne&s;s, but cannot <HI>create</HI> it: and among&s;t the &s;ordid connections of men, it is not uncommon to be in|ve&s;ted with the public &s;anction with|out
<PB N="159" REF="156">
ever receiving a private a&s;&s;ent from the under&s;tanding or the heart. I do not think the law of the land, of it&s;elf, &s;ufficient to make a woman happy. Marriage is a very honour|able, but it may be a very mi&s;erable in&s;titution: that is, it may produce mi&s;ery while it confers honour. The <HI>ceremony</HI> is only the <HI>&s;eal</HI> of mutual love, but the <HI>bond</HI> &s;hould be made before; and in point of attachment I hold my|&s;elf at this moment as religiou&s;ly uni|ted to Henry as if all the forms of the earth had pa&s;&s;ed my lips in confir|mation. The &s;ame idea will be lodged in my bo&s;om whether that confirma|tion be remote or near. It is not in|tended by Heaven to be the affection of a year only. It is to la&s;t for life.
<PB N="160" REF="157">
It is to follow its object through all perils and dangers. Its holy ardour is to burn equally bright and pure, and nothing but death is to extingui&s;h it. Thus contracted, my father, in &s;pirit and in truth, you will ea&s;ily judge how light mu&s;t be the &s;acrifice of my cou&s;in's &s;trange legacy. The <HI>political</HI> tenets of Mr. Hammond have nothing to do with my friend&s;hip for him. As they have carried him into a dangerous path of life, far from <HI>me,</HI> I &s;o far deplore them.

decide between you? The feeble voice of a woman will neither be heard or admitted.

I only act up to tho&s;e &s;imple principles of moral life, which a&s;&s;ure me that con|&s;tancy in favour of <HI>a known valuable object</HI> (not ob&s;tinate predilection to a <HI>bad one</HI>) is the ba&s;is on which the &s;u|per&s;tructure of all that is noble, ju&s;t, and good, mu&s;t be rai&s;ed. My wi&s;|dom is extremely limited. It &s;tretches not into tho&s;e maxims which de&s;olate the earth for a vapour of victory, nor does it pre&s;ume to penetrate the wiles of government. All it <HI>does</HI> pretend to, belongs to that &s;mall and dear &s;y&s;|tem in which every woman ought to be in&s;tructed; namely, that a <HI>well|fixed

If my beloved father would for one moment lay the clamorous contenti|ons of a bickering &s;pecies a&s;ide, and &s;ubmit to be charmed by that di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate power which decides calmly of truth and fal&s;hood, he would be con|vinced of this. I am &s;ure he would: for his nature is gentle and his heart is &s;oft. Ah think what a ta&s;k it is for your &s;oul-&s;ick Emma to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing the&s;e pleadings at <HI>&s;uch a time!</HI> Come to her bed &s;ide&mdash;
