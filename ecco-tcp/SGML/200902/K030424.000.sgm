<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t hint of this Comedy was &s;ugge&s;ted by the <HI>Cocu Imaginaire</HI> of <HI>Moliere,</HI> who took the idea of his piece from an Italian writer. Though jealou&s;y, in all its appearances, has been frequently exhi|bited on the Engli&s;h &s;tage, yet it was ima|gined that a plan, which &s;hould delineate all the varieties of that pa&s;&s;ion, whether &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting between lovers or in the matrimonial life, and blend them together in one piece, would not be unacceptable to the public. If therefore there is atonement made for the want of originality of character by the de|cency of the dialogue, the novelty of the fable, and the complication of the incidents, the author has compa&s;&s;ed all that he pro|po&s;ed to him&s;elf in the en&s;uing &s;cenes; which, with plea&s;ure he finds, were the occa&s;ion of producing the too long concealed powers of Mi&s;s <HI>Haughton,</HI> and of &s;hewing, in a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed light, the exqui&s;ite acting of Mr. <HI>Obrien.</HI></P>
